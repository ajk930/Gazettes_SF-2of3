DEWEY DECLARES HE
IS YET IN THE RACE
Denies a Statement Published in New
York to the Effect That He*
Would Retire.
NEW YORK. April 10.â A Washington
special to the Evening World says: , It
Is asserted this afternoon, on what seems
to be good authority, that Admiral. Dewey
has decided to withdraw' as a. candidate
for the Presidency, and that within a few
days he" will formally announce his ' de
cision. His brother-ln-luw, John R. " Mc-
Lean, Is alleged to be responsible for this
latest move: Within - forty-eight 'hours
Admiral Dewey has been in consultation
with Democratic leaders and others an
tagonistic to President McKlnley, and the
opinions then expressed, together. with un
favorable or non-committal views, voiced
by .the newspapers, decided him, it is as
serted, to withdraw from the contest.

Dewcy said, to-night that the report pub

the, effect that he Intended to . withdraw,
his candidacy â¢ for the Presidency was all
a mistake, and that he had never given
any one whatever any sucis information.
BERLIN. April 10.â The latest events in South Africa are Interpreted as being very unfavorable to Great Britain,
but General Yon Becher. in the Lokal Anzeiger. says: . "Evidently the British will soon begin a concentric advance move
ment, rendering it impossible for the Boers to communicate with their forces within,* the inner 'line, but the principal
danger for the British remains in their extremely long approvislonment lines. .It will be, however, next to impossible
for the Boers to continue movements in the open field when Lord Roberts moves after : putting, his army in first-class con
dition." . . - '.Â¦Â¦Â¦â¢Â¦

BLOEMFONTEIN. Monday. April 9.â Remounts are continually arriving, but competent authorities estimate that the
wastage of horses monthly by the British forces in South Africa must be calculated at not less than 5000.
LONDON. April 11.â The Bloemfontein correspondent of the Morning Post says: "The water supply continues satis
factory." Entrenching is proceeding vigorously en the hills commanding Bloemfontein. Civilian labor is to be utilized. Sick
ness amoriK the troops is somewhat diminishing."
The Bloemfontein correspondents of the Times, telegraphing Monday, says: "The enemy Is making a desperate attempt
to discover a strategic opej^ng. Their numbers are unknown to us. but are anywhere between 3000 and COOO. They are
moving cautiously. Remounts are arriving, but the Argentine animals are little liked by the'cavalry. Among the valuable
documents discovered belonging to Messrs. Steyn and Fischer is some correspondence proving that the fall of Ladysralth

BULUTVAYO. Tuesday, April 3.â Colonel Plumer engaged the Boers between \ Ramathlabama and Mafeking March- 31.
The Boers appeared in considerable force six miles from Mafeking. and to prevent being outflanked on both sides Plumer
had to withdraw on Ramathlabama, subsequently retiring to his base campl The engagement lasted three hours and the
retirement was well carried out in good order under a heavy fire. â¢ -
The foregoing dispatch is the British version of the defeat of Colonel Plumer's force first announced April 5 in a spe
cial dispatch from Lourenzo Marques, which said sham fighting occurred April 2 In the neighborhood of Mafeking. It was
added that ihe garrison made sorties, while Colonel Plumer's cavalry attacked the Boers at Ramathlabama. Both attacks.
it was asserted, were repulsed. Twenty of Colonel Plumer's men were found dead on the field and six others were made
prisoners. The federal iosses were said to be small.
GABERONES. Sunday. April I.â Yesterday Colonel Plumer, with 270 mounted men and a few infantry and one Maxim
pun. arrived at Ramathlabama. where he left the dismounted men and proceeding along the railroad to within sight of
Mafeking the advance guard, under Colonel White, encountered a large body of Boers, and almost simultaneously ;the left
ard right flanks were attacked and sharp fighting followed. The Boers were in crescent formation and outnumbered the
British two to one. They advanced with skill and stubbornness and persistently endeavored to encircle the British. After
holding his ground for an hour Colonel Plumer retired, with the Boers slowly following him up. The fighting continued
throughout the ten-mile retreat to Ramathlabama. where the British Maxim gun was brought into play. After a stiff fight
Colonel Plumer reached his camp. The British casualties were: Killed, three officers and seven men; wounded, three officers
end twenty-four men; missing, eleven. The Boer loss was serious.
At the conclusion of the flght General Snyman informed Colonel Baden-Powell that he had some British wounded,
and both Baden-Powell and Plumer sent ambulances. The Boers were also busy Sunday collecting their dead and wounded.
Most of the British wounded were only s'lghtly hurt. Colonel Plumer was wounded.but was able to carry out his duties.
While the ambulance vas still at Ramathlabama, April 2. General Snyman with 800 men and three guns arrived
there and finding no British troops in the vicinity returned to Mafeking. It Is reported here that the advance guard of
Lord Methuen's relief force has left Vryburg for Mafeking.
Saturday's fight In the environs of Mafeklng was conducted on Colonel Plumer's side under great difficulties, be
ing In the proximity of the Boer laagers, whence re-enforcements could be promptly sent to the burghers, and there was
little cover available for the British when the fight began, the plain being but. sparsely wooded and the railroad em
bankment, the chief protection, being only two feet high. The men behaved gallantly, however, and officers were unex
ceptlonally conspicuous in the affair. With the exception of a few rounds fired by the British Maxim, gun at Ramathla
bama, the fire on both sides was entirely by rifles. Half of the Britlsn officers were more or less seriously wounded.
Colonel Plumcr's wound was in his right arm. His horse was shot. Colonel Bodle and Captain Rolt were wounded.
Colonel Plumer's orderly is missing. Sergeant Major Manning of the Fifth Dragoon Guards, who took up the duties of
orderly, did excellent work. Captain Fred Crewe was shot dead while covering the retreat of others. Captain Maclaren
was severely wounded, and Lieutenant Mill!gan, the famous Yorkshire cricketer, fatally, -while tenaciously holding an as
signed position. Lieutenant Mllligan rode unassisted to Ramathlabama. ' Â£
The Gaberones dispatch is another British version of the defeat of Colonel Plumer.
LOXDOX. April 11. â A dispatch to the Daily Mai: from Brandfort, dated Sunday, says: Yesterday De.-AVet

LONDON, April 11.â A third very seri
ous defeat has been Inflicted upon
the British forces In the Orange
Free State, according to dispatches
to the Daily Mall, quoting advices
from , Boer sources. The report of
the victory is (hat on Saturday General De
Wet's Burghers attached the British
forces, 1500, strong. |at Meerkatsfonteln.
After a fierce engagement in which, ac
cording, to- one account. COO British were
killed or.; wotimled; the Boers captured the
entire command. " ". ~ " â Â¦'.'
' The War Office has hot mode public any.
dispatches' indicating the possibility of
such an engagement, nor do any press tel
egrams received from the correspondents
with ihe British army., many of which
bear later date than Saturday, contain
any hint of this disaster. Yet the censor
ship is very stringent at present and
might easily prevent such news . from
reaching England until after Lord Rob
erts had seen tit to report on it.
The location of Meerkatsfontein, where
the battle is said to have been fought, is
uncertain. One dispatch says it is to the
south of Bloemfontein, and apparently in
the neighborhood of Reddersburg. If this
be the case the British force alleged to
have been cut on* might be the column
which Gatacre sent to Reddersburg to aid
the hard pressed British force there, but
which arrived after the surrender and
then retired to Bethanie.
Another Pretoria dispatch locates the
battlefield south of Brandfort and north
of Bloemfontein. in which case it might
be a part .'of. General Tucker's division,
which has been lying at Karee Siding
since the battle around the kopjes there.
The dispatches agree in stating that the
British loss in killed, wounded and pris
oners was about 1500 men.
Hard lighting took place around Wepen
er Monday and yesterday, where a part of
General Brabant's colonial division is be
ing attacked by the Boers. The losses in
the first day's battle are said to have been
heavy. The Burghers have ..been rein
forced by. a commando from Dewets
dorp and renewed the attack, the result
of which is not known.
That Lord Roberts realizes the serious
ness of the present conditions in the Free
Slate i 3 shown by the fact that General
Rundle, with his Eighth Division, has
been ordered to Springfontein. This puts
10,000 more men on duty to guard the rail
way and keep the Boers away from the
British line of communications.
Beers have again crossed the Orange
River, which will tend to stir up new re
bellion among the Dutch in the north of
Cape Colony. They are in greatest force
near Aliwal North, at Odendaalstroom,
east of Bethulie and south of Smithfleld.
They have destroyed the pont over the
river.
Practically the Boers hold the whole of
the Free State cast of the railway all the
way from Ficksburg . to Orange River.
Two thousand- of them are said to be
marching from Smithfleld on Springfon
tein Junction.*; v -
It Is very probable that with only his
division. General Gatacre would not have
been able to hold all the railway line" as
far north as Kaffir River had not Run
die's division been ordered to his assist
ance.
It is now made plain that Colonel
Plumer penetrated within six miles of
Maf eking on 'March 31, .but was then
obliged to retire to avoid being outflanked.
He fell back not merely to : Ramathla
bama, out even to his base camp.
Untfi the Boer besiegers are seriously
threatened from the couth it seems cer
tain that the relief of Mafeking cannot
bo effected. Weeks must elapse before
Rhodesia hears if Plumer can be rein
forced by any -troops coming by way. of
Belra' and Salisbury.
SCOUT BURNHAM TELLS OF BOER ACCURACY.

LONDON, April 11.â A dispatch to the. Morning Post from Bloemfontein. dated , Apri l ,9. gives a description by F. R.
Burnham, the American scout with General .Roberts, of the Boer trek from Kornspruit. Mr. Burnham says: "Owing to
a report that the British had occupied, Brandfort and were moving to Wlnberg the course of the convoy was altered and
the Boers . pushed forward with increased speed toward Wlnberg. They expected cavalry pursuit every hour, and the
convoy was protected .with the greatest care and subtlety, the road being taken between kopjes held and evacuated In suc
cession by rear guards. 'The trek proceeded ' throughout Sunday and Monday and on Monday morning the convoy was
ten miles from .Wlnberg.". .-â¢â¢â¢Â¦ ;. .
Mr. Burnham, explaining. the Boer.method of obtaining the range for rifle fire, says: "One man fired successive shots
and watched the dust raised by the bullets until accuracy, was obtained, .and lie then communicated the range to his
comrades." 7; .':;\'j'' , Â¦- . .< â¢ Ii j ... Â¦ Â¦ â¢â¢ â¢ ' ,vv:Â»...;w. .....
Mr. Burnham also* mentions the way in which work intrusted- to men: with tired horses was -immediately, taken up by
others with fresh animals if occasion 'offered, the newcomers being" given' instructions and the range of the men whose
places they took. He-was struck by , the "extraordinary fullness of the instructions given by the commanders to the men
before any movement was. begun." These included information as to the route to be followed; the intention of the move
ment and the different rendezvous in case of either victory or defeat. Another thing that impressed him greatly, was the
"total absence of leading;" in some instances every man having received instructions and carrying them out Independently
and as speedily as possible. Â¦ â¢ - Â¦Â¦ :..-...

BOERS SECURE THIRTY PIECES OF ARTILLERY.
LONDON. April 11.â The correspondent of the Times at Lourenzo Marquez., telegraphing .Monday, says: "Trustworthy
refugees assert that the Boers recently obtained at least thirty pieces of artillery, some of large caliber, which were brought
overland as machinery from a West African port: Eight of these guns were d'spatcned to the Free State a week ago. The
Boer officials openly boast that they have succeeded in smuggling ammunition through Portuguese territory. In- the coursa
of the Dempsey trial State Engineer Munnlk admitted under pressure that, acting under Instructions from State Secretary

The Boers then stormed the Kaffir position, killing thirty-one. The Kaffirs fought stubbornly.
Skirmishes are reported at Biggarsberg and in the Free State, mostly between patrols.

FIERCE BATTLE
WITH A WHALE
One Man Loses His Life
as a Result of the
Conflict.
SAN ANTONIO. Tex., April 10.â The
waters are receding in the swollen rivers
and streams of Texas and it is believed
that the worst Is over. The property
damage by reason of the sudden rush of
water will be very large, while many lives
have been lost.
It is learned to-night that eight persons
out of a traveling party of fifteen, com
posing two families, were drowned at the
junction of Middle Concho River and
Kiowa Creek, in Iron County. The names
of the families are Queen and Wilson, and
they were from Voca, McCullough Coun
ty, Tex. Of the eleven members of the
Queen family seven were drownedâ the
father, mother and five childrenâ among
the latter being an eight-months-old baby.
A boy of the Wilson family was swept
away. bodies of the victims of the
flood were found after a search of thirty
hoursJ
AUSTIN, Tex., April 10.â The waters of
the Colorado River are rapidly receding
at this point, and while additional rises
are reported from the north it is not be
lieved that they will be of sufficient vol
ume to do further damage. Advices
from every section of the flooded district
up to to-night indicate that the informa
tion given out on Sunday and Monday
fully covers the situation. The property
loss has been great and the loss of life
is as originally placed.
Outside of the list of drowned at Austin
and some negro families in the bottoms
to the south of the city the fatalities have
been few. One or two negroes are re
ported drowned in Fayette County. Every
section tributary to the river was warned
of the coming of the flood, and this is why
the loss of life was not greater. The
waters, having swept the counties of
Travis, Bastrop. Fayette and Guadaloupe,
and points north of here, are now wash-
Ing farms in Wharton County as the flood
nears the gulf. That section of the low
lands is under water, the river being some
six or eight miles wide in places. The in
habitants were warned In time to remove
their livestock and valuables to higher
ground. Â¦â¢ -
ROCKDALE, Tex., April 10.â Thousands
of acres of corn and cotton have been
destroyed in this county by the floods of
the past few days. Lower Little River
was four miles wide this morning and
lacked only eight inches of being as high
as in June last year.'
The engineering corps of the Santa Fe
Railroad reports the rise as being one
and a half feet higher than last year.
San Gabriel River and Brussey Creek'
have been out over the lowlands, but are
receding. The Brazos is expected to over
flow to-night.
HON. W. A. CLARK OF MONTANA.
The unseating of Clark in the Senate Is said to be but another episode
in the bitter political and business feud waged for years between Clark and
Marcus Daly, the copper king.
WASHINGTON, April 10.â The
Senate Committee on Privileges
and Elections to-day decided by
a unanimous vote to recom
mend the adoption of a resolu
tion declaring: that Hon. W. A.
Clark ft Montana Is not entitled to occupy
his seat as a Senator from Montana. The
incision was reached after a two hours'
Fitting, at which all the members of the
committee were present except one. The
absentee was Senator Caffery of Louisi
ana, and he wired his vote in opposition to
Â«*Urk. The ballot was not taken until all
the members present had expressed them
selves upon the question, some of them
Fjv-aklng at some length and all express-
Ing -.fferent shades of opinion.
Senator Harris of Kansas indicated the
most pronounced leaning toward leniency
for Clark. He did not express any doubt
that there had been a lavish expenditure
cf money in Clark's behalf, and while not
*on<3onlrg this course he. spoke in terms
of strons condemnation of the tactics
pursued by some of Clark's opponents, re
ferring especially to Congressman Camp-
V.ell and ex-Scr.ator Whiteside, He said
that, whatever Clark's offenses, they were
but little worse than the methods pursued
by Campbell and Whiteside in their ef
forts to expose the Senator, and he Insist
ed that if the report was to be antago
nistic to Clark it should at the same time
relate in full detail the course pursued by
the two principal witnesses against him.
Pettus Sides With Clark.
Senator Pettus practically agreed with
Karris. The two Senators also expressed
t ome doubt as to the justification of the
conclusion drawn by a majority of the
committee that Senator Clark's candidacy
lor thÂ« Senate bc-gan in August, IS9S. when
he returned to Butte from New York. The
effect of this conclusion "was to charge up
the entire $123,003 which Senator Clark
confessed to having expended in his cam
paign for the Senate, while tbe contention
was made in Senator Clark's behalf that
he had not become a candidate until after
The State election, thus eliminating from
the campaign in his individual behalf the
amount spent in the general contest. Sen
ator McComas Â»as among the Senators
who txpressed themselves as convinced
That the Senatorial scat was in view from
The beginning. McComas, however, united
Â¦with other Senators in condemning the
methods pursued in prosecuting the case.
The consensus of the opinion of the com
mittee appeared unfavorable to accepting
sny one especial feature against Clark as
the basis for the report a*rainst him. the
general opinion being that it was the cum
ulative character of the testimony that
rhould be considered rather than any one
especial detail.
Harris raised the point in Clark's be
h.alf that the cumulative effect of the tes
timony could not properly be considered,
tut he was overruled on his position
If prominence was given to any one line
cf testimony more than to another It was
to that doling with transactions ap
parently of a rejrular business nature be
lworn Clark or lii? acents and members of
the Legislature. The purchase of prop
rrty from State Senator Warner and Rep
resentative McLaughlin and the money
tendered Representative Wood to lift
the mortgage from his ranch were
considered as> bearing directly upon
the case. Of these matters the
Wood case received especial attention.
The payment of money to Representative
Pay after Clark's election also had
weight. The opinion was expressed that
no one of .these facts was sufficient basis
for an adverse report, but all agreed that
all the facts, many of them admitted, to
gether with other occurrences connected
with the campaign, were sufficient to lus
tify a positive position against the Sen
ator continuing to hold his place.
Destruction of Vouchers.
The fact that Clark and his representa
tives had failed to make their reports to
the State authorities of Montana as re
quired by the State law also was urged
against him in the discussion in the com
mittee, as was the fact that he and his
representatives had destroyed all their
vouchers showing where money had been
used and to whom paid. When, attention
was called to the fact that this course
Vas usual with campaign managers the
statement was met with the contention
that while the plan might be more com
monly adopted than it has been, still
there could be no reasonable excuse for it
after the Whiteside exposure. It was then
known- that there would be a contest, and
the argument was made that every scrap
of paper bearing upon the election should
have been preserved after this develop
ment in the case.
Chandler and Turley were directed to
prepare the report. It is expected to be
presented at an early day.
There were many expressions In the
committee favorable to Senator Clark
from a personal point of view, and more
than one Senator gave utterance of
doubts as to whether he had personal
part in or knowledge of the expenditure.
Others expressed the opinion that the
Senator was in a certain sense the victim
of environment and of habit. The outlay
of money in past elections in Montana
was dwelt upon as one of the explanations
of the liberal expenditures in this case.
Senator Turley was among the Senators
who dissented from the view that Clark
could have been uninformed that money
was being used to promote his election,
and he made one of the most vigorous
talks of the series In favor of an adverse
report.
Clark was at the Capitol when the an
nouncement of the action of the commit
tee was made known. He was surprised
at the result, but refused to make a state
ment until after consultation with his
friends and attorneys. The Senator bore
himself with his usual composure. 'Â¦Â¦ His
face appeared somewhat flushed, but his
voice was calm and his manner collected,
and he discussed other business affairs as
if nothing had transpired. He was asked
if there was any truth in the report that
he had decided to resign, and he replied
as he did to all other questions â¢bearing
upon his case:
"I. cannot at present answer any ques
tions bearing upon the report of the Com
mittee on Elections."
Ex-Senator Faulkner, counsel for Clark,
was summoned to the Capitol Immedi
ately after the verdict of the committee
was announced and had a long conversa
tion-with his client over the situation. -

the Judge of the Superior Court of Sari
Mateo County is charged with dereliction
of duty, thereby disqualifying him from
trying the case.
The action arose out of certain alleged

' "Many have ' thought Chairman Hep

tion of pressing it for consideration and
that-. 1- had been 'gold Â¦ .bricked' when I
was made to believe the bill would be al
lowed to come up. Since the bill was
favorably, reported I ' have believed It
would be considered at the present'ses
sion and I believe It* now. 'I desire to as
sure the 'people of California ; that, In my
Judgment, Mr. Hepburn is, In good faith

I â¢ have shared .in the â¢Â¦ beliefâ not wise to
press the bill in the House until the fate
oÂ£ the Hay- Pauncefote- treaty was set
tled. The. treaty having been indefinitely
laid aside, there will be no further delay
in the consideration of the canal bill. No
day has yet been fixed, but the bill will
pass the House at this session. I think
it will not pass the Senate now, but Sena

Is that not. more than five or six votes
will be cast against the bill in. the -House

a Thrilling Encounter in
the South Seas.
Soeclal Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON. April 10.â The story of a fatal
battle with an enormous fighting sperm
whale Is told in- letters which have just
been received here from members of the
crew of the Boston whaling bark Jose
phine now: at Port- Payta, Peru.
Four boats were lowered, and two of
them came to grief in the conflict with
the sea monster, one of the boats being
disabled and the other being smashed into
splinters. The fourth mate of the Jose
phine, who was in the last mentioned
craft, lost his life in the terrible melee.
The whale was picked out of an entire
school in the South Pacific and at the out
set showed fierce fight. .First Mate Smith
of Provincetown, who was in charge of
the first boat, was compelled to back out
quickly for safety, his craft leaking badly
in consequence or a blow from the whale's
tail. Upon the approach of the next boat,
under command of the fourth mate, the
whale, as full as ever of fight, rushed
upon the newcomer and In an instant rent
it into fragments, pieces of planking, tim
bers, tugs, oars and men being sent flying
together high in the air. The fourth mate
had received a death blow and he quickly
sank, leaving his companions clinging, to
bits of wreckage. ,
Having temporarily repaired the hole in
the boat, the first mate resumed the fight,
but his boat received another telling blow,
though he escaped serious injury. Mean
while the condition of the men In -the
water was perilous indeed and, recogniz
ing their need of speedy assistance, the
maimed craft was pulled that, way and
the drowning men were hauled on board.
Besides killing the fourth mate, the whale
had badly injured one of the oarsmen.

not live with him any more."
Armstrong also alleges that he has in
vited her to live with him as his wife,
and she has refused to do so. He says
he has observed his marital obligations
and always supported the defendant in
good style and conducted himself lovingly
toward her.
The only child born of the marriage Is
a son 16 years old. now living with the
plaintiff. He is George Nesbitt Armstrong.
Through her counsel, Mme. Melba made
a denial of the allegations of the plain
tiff. She was not present In person and
her counsel was appointed by the court.
After the denial was filed the court en
tered a decree of divorce In favor of the
plaintiff.
Armstrong Is the owner of the Buena

LOS ANGELES. April 10.â It Is a sub
ject of remark' in Los Angeles that the
Bryan enthusiasm is not so great to-day
as it was July 4, 1597, when he appeared
at Fiesta Park. To-night in front of his
hotel, though a band played the liveliest
airs, the crowd did not exceed 300, while
there -was room for scores of persons in
the rotunda of the hotel. Whether Bryan
is profiting by this trip is a question that
many are asking. It is known that when
the people of Riverside, in common with
other towns of Southern California, asked
that Bryan be allowed to- address them,
his managers asked that the people raise
$100 for the privilege. This .was politely
declined, as . they were dumfounded by
the proposal. The silver dollars not ma
terializing, the people of Riverside to-day
saw the orator pass through, but no set
address was delivered. ;
At a late hour to-night Bryan'B schedule
for going East was changed from 2 o'clock
to-morrow afternoon until 8 o'clock to
morrow, hence the reception that had
been arranged for to-morrow morning will
not be held.
SAN BERNARDINO. April 10.â William
Jennings Bryan spoke to an audience of

national bank currency, under which sys
tem the banks will have power to con
tract the currency and expand It at wllL
They want to have what tney call elastic
currency, with the banks holding both
ends of the elastic."
The speaker paid rorao attention to
trusts, and said he would continue to fight
for the restoration of bimetallism at the
ratio of 16 to 1.
In closing, he said that & largo army

MYSTERY IN
DISAPPEARANCE
OF FRANK FISH
Writes a Letter Saying He
Is Going a Long
Journey.
Drops Out of Sight, Leaving All His
Possessions Behindâ For Nearly
Two Months No Word Has
Been Received.
fcDecial Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, April 10.â Frank Fish.
22 years old, has disappeared and his fam
ily, former employers and friends are at
a loss to fathom the strange occurrence.
Fish was a stenographer of ability and
earned a good salary in the commission
house of Henderson & Brown. A couple
of days before Washington's birthday he
asked permission to leave the city for a
few days, and his employers granted the
request, at the same time promising him
an increase in salary. He did not return
at the time indicated and his relatives
here began to make inquiries as to hia
whereabouts. His mother, Mrs. F. N.
Fish of 917 Union street, Oakland, was ap
pealed to, but > she sent word back that
she had seen nothing of her son, at the
same time expressing alarm by reason of
the report of his disappearance. In a day
or two word was received from Cal Fiah
of Xapa, saying that he had received a
letter from his brother Frank, postmark
ed San Francisco, February 22, in which
he informed his brother that he had gone
away and that it, would be no use to
try to find him, as it would not accom
plish anything. Frank closed the letter
to his brother by saying that he would
try to let his folks hear trom him in four
or five months. Soon after the receipt of
the letter a visit was made to Frank's
room in a private lodging-house at Eighth
and L streets. The room was found to
contain all of his possessions, showing
that he had left! the city without taking
his best suit of clothes, his trunk, any of
the family pictures or trinkets or even
his week's wash from the laundry, which
remained unopened. His letter to his
brother in Napa apprised him of his
debts, which were small, but there was
nothing about the appearance of theroom
to show that the young man had made
the slightest preparation to go on a jour
ney of four or five months, or even of a
day. lie had no money, so far as any
body knows, and his. accounts with his
employers were perfectly straight. He
was not given to the use of liquor ajid
had no evil associates, so far as known.
At the time of his departure Fish was
attentive to a young lady of excellent
character. She is as completely mystified
as any one concerning the disappearance,
and no one has yet come forward with a
plausible explanation of the young man's
conduct. Fish came here a few years ago
from Oakland, where his mother and
other relatives reside. He attended the
State University for a year.
ANTIOCH. April lO.VPassengers on the
new line river steamer Captain Weber
were compelled to witness a shocking ex
hibition of disregard for human life on
the boat's trip from Stockton- to ' San
Francisco Monday night. K. S. Killian.
a brakeman on the Santa Fe, who was a
passenger, on the boat and an eye-wit
ness to the whole affair, tells the. follow
ing story:
He says that when the Captain Weber
was a few miles this side, of Stockton the
purser and captain started -..to collect
fares. They came to a passenger who was
under the influence ooff f liquor. The man
was lying on the lower deck. He had no
money or was either too drunk to find
it and was unable to pay fare. The cap
tain "of the Weber then stopped and had
the man carried ashore by the deckhands.
The boat was then backed o.ut into the
stream, leaving the man on the levee.
Just as she was beginning to get under
way and as she came opposite to where
the man was lying he got up on his- feet,
staggered about and fell. from the levee
Into the river. . . . . , .-'
Passengers had remonstrated with the
captain when he left the man on top of
the levee, insisting that the deckhands
should carry him over the levee, antici
pating just what did occur. The captain,
however, paid no attention to their re
quest and left the man in his perilous po
sition. Â«j , â¢Â¦ i .Â¦Â¦ ; ' .Â¦>:.'Â¦ Â¦â¢ â¢â¢
After the .man had fallen from the levee
he floundered around In the water/ and' at
last got hold of.tho limb of a willow tree,
lie was then standing in water up to his
breast, and just as the boat made a turn
so that- a-pile driver obscured the view
of those on board he lost his hold on the
limb, and with a Â¦ heavy sack that was
tied on hlsback fell backward and dis
appeared under, the water. Women
shrieked and' cried, becoming â¢ frantic,
while the men raved and .threatened, but
the captain was stubborn, and refused to
turn, back to render ..the man any assist-,
ance. The â¢ passengers looked for somo
one on the pile driver to go to the man's
aid,, but there was no one on board when
the. steamer passed. The passengers
threatened to take the captain out of the
pilot house and force him to return to
where they. believed the man was drown
ing before their eyes.
The man who is supposed to" have
drowned was apparently a working man
about 50 years of age. Ho was dressed
in overalls and a long canvas coat.'

CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLING
TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON. April 10.â
Major General Otis has taken measures to
investigate the charges made several
months ago against Brigadier General
Frederick Funston and Colonel W. S. Met
calf, who commanded the Twentieth Kan
sas Volunteer Infantry. This action is in'
accordance with instructions sent by the
War Department, as shown by an official
order issued by General Otis, dated March
1, a copy of which has Just been received.
The papers referred to the board for in
vestigation include the charges and coun
tercharges preferred by General Funston
against officers and men of the Kansas
regiment and by officers and men of the
regiment against General Funston and
Colonel Metcalf.
There is no doubt that there was grave
lack of harmony tn the regiment. The
department seemed to : support General
Funston when it gave instructions to him
to return to Manila. He was accused of
"playing to the grand stand," of never
giving the regiment any other commands
than "forward, guide: right," and ot
shielding Colonel Metcalf, who was
charged with having shot an unarmed
Filipino.
It is understood that Lieutenant Colonel
Mallory investigated a year ago the re
port that Colonel Metcalf had shot an un
armed native who was a prisoner of war
and reported not supporting the charges.
General Funston is said to have been in
favor of a strict Investigation of the
charges, but. the department deems it de
sirable not only in the interest of disci
pline in the service but for political rea
sons to have the charges inquired into.
Should the board report sustaining the
charges Colonel Metcalf cannot be dis
ciplined, as he is out of the serviced nor
can any of the other officers and men who
were members of the Kansas regiment.
General Funston is the only officer of the
Kansas regiment Implicated In the
charges who is now in the service.

REPUBLICS MAY

Action of Nicaraguan Fili
busters Likely to Cause
Trouble.
Have Landed on the Isthmus of
Panama to Seize a Tract Claimed
by Both Colombia and
Costa Rica.
WASHINGTON. April 10.â It would not
surprise officials here if the recent action
of Nicaraguan filibusters in landing on
the isthmus should result in involving at
least three of the Central American re
publics in difficulties. Reports received
here have indicated that trouble was
brewing in Colombia for some time past
and there have been frequent rumors of
the intention of Nlcaraguans to attack
Costa Rica. It appears that the Nicara
guans have now actually made a landing,
though it is not clear whether their
movement is directed against Nicaragua
or Costa Rica.
The point where the party landed Is on
the Pacific side of the isthmus and the
party made its way to a place named
David, near the boundary line between
Costa Rica and Colombia, but within the
lines of the tract of territory claimed by
both nations. The Government of Colom
bia has taken steps to send a force
against the filibusters, assuming that
they are on Colombian soil, and it Is
possible that the Government of Costa
Rica will do likewise. In that case there
may be complications.
Meanwhile, the cruiser Detroit has gone
into the Gulf of Chiriqui, on the Gulf
side, but the nearest point of access to
David, to safeguard American Interests.
DENIES MOTION
TO DISMISS A
FELONY CHARGE
Ex- Marshal Chaigneau Must
Stand a Trial for Em
bezzlement.
District Attorney and Superior JudgÂ«
of Napa County Disagree in
Court as to the Course
to Pursue. . â¢
NAPA. April 10.â This morning Judga
Ham denied the motion of District Attor
ney Bell to dismiss the charge of felony
pending against Paul Chaigneau for the
alleged embezzlement of $2200 from the
funds of the city of Napa while Chaigneau
held the office of Marshal. Chaigneau's
trial has been set for April 24.
The District Attorney feels that there
is not enough evidence to secure a convic
tion. The defendant was indicted by the
last Grand Jury, that adjourned the lat
ter part of last week, which body also
considered evidence against R H. Sterl
ing, a former School Trustee, who was
discovered to be short about $300 in his
accounts with the Napa school district
No indictment against Sterling was re
turned, however, and the District Attor
ney does not think that It Is right to pros
ecute one man and let another go. Both
Chaigneau and Sterling repaid the various
sums alleged to have been embezzled ancl
the matter was dropped until taken up by
the Grand Jury- The case of Chaigneau
caused considerable discussion between
Judge Ham and District Attorney Bell in
court. Attorney Webber of the defense
has intimated that he will ask for a
change of venue, because both the Judgo
and the District Attorney have disquali
fied themselves In the discussion of the
case.
FUNERAL OF REV. JOSEPH
HEMPHILL WELL ATTENDED
Services Probably the Most Impres
sive That Ever Occurred in North
ern Part of Santa Barbara.
Special Discatch to The Call.
SANTA BARBARA, April 10.â The most
impressive funeral services ever known in
the northern part of this county took
place to-day at the Ballard home of the
late Rev. Joseph Hemphill, who commit
ted suicide by shooting, as stated exclu
sively in Monday's Call. The whole popu
lace of the valley turned out, for Rev. Mr.
Hemphill was a well-known man and the
minister of the valley's largest church.
Excitement In the region was as great as
the sorrow, for Hemphill had taken his
life in a most frightful and tragic man
ner. On Sunday morning in a woodshed
back of his farmhouse he had placed the
muzzle of a shotgun to the back of his
head and sent a charge of shot into the
skull. He was found dead by his wife and
family. The suicide was a brother of Dr.
John Hemphill of San Francisco, who
reached Eallard last night. The doctor
stated this evening that he believed his
brother's suicide to have been committed
during temporary insanity. Deceased had
suffered from a long and clinging cold,
and had often been attacked with severe
pains in the head. He was, moreover, of
a naturally depressed disposition, given to
gllent sorrow and the concealment of diffi
culty cf any sort. Dr. Hemphill knows of
no trouble that could have been the cause
cf the tragedy which he says could not
have occurred had Joseph Hemphill been
in his right senses. No cause for such an
act was ever communicated to the doctor,
who was always very fond of the preach
er of lesser fame. The two brothers
were the greatest of friends, Â»nd had
there been any powerful motive for sui
cide it would probably have been knewn
to both. Dr. Hemphill has repeatedly ex
pressed to-day his high opinion of the
dead man's sterling qualities. Yet despite
the terrible blow Rev. John Hemphill
maintains the most perfect self-control,
and has gone about the preparations for
burial In the calmest manner.

SENATE PORTO
RICAN BILL TO
BE SUPPORTED
House Ways and Means Com
mittee Will Report
the Measure.
Vote on Its Final Passage Likely to
Be Close and Republican
Leaders Are Not
Sane-nine.
WASHINGTON. April 10.â At a special
meeting of the Ways and Means Commit
tee to-day it was decided by a vote of
eight to tive to report the Porto Rico bill
as it pasitd the Senate without amend
ment and to move a concurrence in the
Senate amendments. This means the ac
i c<-pt&rio? of the territorial form of govern
\ rner.t for Porto Rico as added to the bill
v yy the Senate and other lesser changes In
the tariff and other features.
The vote on concurring in the Senate
bill was on party lines, with the exception
cf McCall of Massachusetts, the Repub
lican member of the committee who first
dissected from the till. The vote was as
follows:
Ayesâ Payne, Dalzell. Hopkins. Grosvenor.
BnxaeU. L>olllver, Steele and L<ong, Republi
can* â iv
j;oÂ«> ! ,_McCa:i (Hep.). Richardson. Swanson,
aieCklSand, Underwood. I>einocratsâ fi.
"The vote was not preceded by any ex
tended discussion. Grosvenor promptly
making the motion to concur and report.
It was made known during the meeting
that the bill would be taken up to-mor
row and a strong- intimation was given
that the plan contemplated was to ailow
eitch Â«=ide two hours.
A meeting cf the Rules Committee has
been called for 11 o'clock to-morrow morn
ing, when the question of a special rule
Jixing the time and duration of debate will
be dettrmined. If two hours on each side
is allowed the vote will come late in the
day. if at all to-morrow, as considerable
time will be Fpent in passing the special
rule.
As to the final result of the vote there
continues to be much doubt and not a lit
tle anxiety on the Republican side owing
to the extremely narrow margin between
the two sides. Representative Long, the
Republican "whip." said:
"There is too much doubt to venture a
prediction. The situation is summed up
thus: The Republican majority in the
House is nineteen: there are eight Re
publicans against the bill; that leaves a
majority of only three. It is a narrow
mcrcin.
Representative Underwood, the Demo
cratic "whip." said:
"We will have every man present except
two. who are sick abed. There will be no
Democratic votes for the bill. This will
make the vote very close."

BUSINESS MEN
GIVE TESTIMONY
Evidence of Portland Merchants
Before the Interstate Com
merce Commission.
Oppose the Petition of Middle West Jobbers for
Graded Rates, Elimination of Differen
tials and Other Requests.
Special Dispatch to the Call.
PORTLAND, Or.. April 10.âCommis
sioners J. C. Clements and J. W.
Fifer of the Interstate Commerce
Commission heard the testimony of
Portland merchants to-day in op
position to the petition of the Middle West
jobbers for graded rates, elimination of
differentials between carload and leas
than carload shipments and for the exten
sion of terminal rates to all points on the
Pacific Coast.
The jobbers who testified put up a
strong and convincing case. In demand
ing the concessions set forth in the peti
tion the Middle West ignores the influ
ence of ocean transportation In rate
making. The Portland Jobbers showed
that the ocean is a factor and that when
it is utilized for commerce all rates,
whether graded or otherwise, nrnst be
based upon it. Alfred Biles of .W. P.
Fuller & Co. scored a strong point for the
coast when he told the reason why Pacific
Coast shippers cannot reach the Asiatic
market with goods originating in the
Middle West. To Yokohama or Hongkong
is the same as from the Middle West to
Portland. If Portland merchants wish to
sell Middle West goods in the Asiatic
field they must buy the goods, pay freight
on them to Portland, then the freight to
Asia. These rates amount to prohibition
and effectually shut Portland out of Asia,
so far as Middle West goods are con
cerned.
The steamship company to which Mr.
Biles complained explained that in mak
ing such rates to the Orient it had to take
into consideration the water competition
by way of the Suez canal. If water com
petition influences rates to the Asiatic
field it certainly affects railroad rates to
the Pacic Coast. .
All the witnesses impressed upon the
commission that If differentials are to bÂ«
lowered still further the Pacific Coast
jobbers can and will divert all gwids that
do not have to come br railroad to> thÂ»
sail and steam vessels coming by way of
Cape Horn and Panama. \ This was th*
way the Pacific Coast got its stocks be
fore the days of transcontinental rail
roads, and the ocean is just as deep and
wide and free now as it was then. YeaÂ»
eels can beÂ« had if the cargoes are ofÂ»
fered. Since the decreased differentials of
the Great Northern and Northern Paclflo
became effective last may conalderabla
traffic has been diverted from the rail
roads to the water route.
Half a dozen merchants in represent**
tive lines testified to the encroachment
upon Pacific Coast territory brought
about by the St. Paul tariff.
In the afternoon one of the most Impor
tant witnesses was J. B. Glover, local
freight agent of the O. R. and N. Mr.
Glover's testimony was a gTeat surprise
to the Middle West people and provoked
a fusillade of cross-questions which, did
not shake his original statements. HÂ»
gave the comnnission facts and figured
about the difffrence in cost of merely
handling transcontinental freight at the
Portland terminus in carload and leas
than carload lots. He proved that there
was about aa much trouble and clerical
work involved in hanoling one car ladera
with less than carload goods as there was
in handling thirty-five or forty cars lrt
carload quantities. Transcontinental
freight In carloads was handled at 4 to 6
cents a ton. while in less than carload lota
it cost CO, 70 and 80 cents a ton for hand
ling. He also proved that a car loaded on
the les*-than-the-carload plan carried 30
per cent as much freight aÂ« those loaded
on the carload plan. This evidence waa to
prove the justness of a wide differential.
The commission will finish its heariasc
early to-morrow morning.

SOUGHT TO CAST
HIS WIFE ASIDE
Mine-Owner Hull Must Now An
swer to a Charge of Perjury
in New York.
One of Arizona's Richest Men Accused of
Shameful Cruelty to the Woman Who
Shared His Fortunes.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TUCSON: Ariz.. April 10.â George W.
Hull; who was arrested and placed
in jail to-day In New York City for
perjury in his divorce suit in Prov
idence, R. 1., is one of the wealth
iest and best-known men in Arizona. He
was born In Hull, Mass.. has llveti in this
county the last twenty years, -was a
member cf the nineteenth Arizona Legis
lature and owns mining property in
Jerome and other places in the county.
Some of his most va!ua.ble mines adjoin
the famous United Verde.
Hull married his wife at Phoenix, Ariz..
!n 1838, and they Immediately commenced
housekeeping in their residence at Jerome.
That fall Mrs. Hull went to California on
a visit and she claims that he refused to
send money for her to return to Jerome.
He went East and cold stock in some of
his mines for $225,000.
Last year Hull took his wife East, leav
ing her in New York with $40. and then
Brest away, presumably tÂ£ Mexico, for
several month?. He flled a complaint at
Providence, alleging bona fide residence
for cne year and domiciled there. She
claims there was no service of citation
and says that she did not know of the
divorce suit until Hull testified in the
Boston case that he had been married
and had a divorce. Subsequently she
learned about his proceedings at Provi
dence and made application, because ot
he-r destitute condition, for an allowance.
Hull trif<i to have tn<Â» proceedings dis-
missed, but did not got an ciutr of dis
missal until after the court had entered
anorder for $1100. This has not been paid
and a warrant was sworn out for his
arrest for swearing falsely as to his resi
dence.
Mrs. Hull was born In the Verde Val
ley, Yavapal County, and comes of good
family. Her brother is a wealthy Arizona
stockman. Last February friends in
Boston gave her money to return to Ari
zona, fche claims that she has been per
secuted by Hull and his attorney. She
commenced suit here for separate main
tenance, and la6t Saturday the court or
dered temporary alimony of $150 immedi
ately and the same amount monthly here
after, with expenses and attorney -fees of
the cult. Her nurse girl, brought from
Boston, has been taken from her through
the acts of Hull and his friends, and
forged letters were sent to the girl's
frlÂ«?ntl<Â» to interest them in getting her
away. Hull charges his wife with being
a drunkard. This she denies, and claims
that she is entitled to have some one with
her who can state truthfully that she
does net drink. She says that she has
always been affectionate to him and has
done nothing to entitle him to a divorce.
In her complaint she alleges that on
arriving In New York, he left her alone
while she and her child were ill with the
chickenpox. She fainted on a street and
came ntar being sent to the police sta
tion, but a policeman finally sent her to
her hotel. The complaint is replete with
charges of unconscionable conduct, and
declares specifically that all the time Hull
claimed to be a resident of Providence,
R. 1., he resided at Jerome, Arizona,
and that he was in the East for the pur
pose of making a sale of mining stock.

mous success. The number of educated
dogs in San Francisco and vicinity is un
expectedly large, and the prizes of $10, $5
and $3 attraxrt all the best of them. Pedi
grees are not necessary to show the dogs.

PRELIMINARY TRY-OUT
FOR EASTERN TEAM
Contestants Bun Their Best .in Sev
eral Events for Expe
rience.'
BERKELEY, April 10.â An unofficial
.try-out for the athletes who will go East
and will compete against Stanford was
held on the Berkeley cinder path this
afternoon. There were no attempts to
lower records und the men merely ran
for experience. There were four entries*
in the 100-yard dashâ Symmonds, Town
send. Bishop and Broughton. Bishop won
In the.slow time of 10 4-5 seconds. Brough
ton. second and Symmonds third. In the
440-yard dash Cadogan led by a big mar
gin until the stretch, when he was passed
by Scott, who finished in 52% seconds.
Cadogan was second and Powers third.
In the half milo "VVoolsey, who has re
gained his old-time form, won easily In
2:5 3-5 minutes. Service was second and
Mosier third. Clifford, Gustafson and
Robertson were bunched close at the fin
ish. Broughton did not show any form
In the broad jump, as he has been laid
up for some time with an injured ankle.
As soon as he is well and gets into form
no doubt he will equal his former records.
Squires, who gave much promise of being
a winner in the distance events, has
strained a tendon In his leg and will not
be able to continue training. Hoffman is
vaulting in good form and undoubtedly
will make a new record this year.

for the mil<? nnd a furlong number, but
was not equal to the task. The older
mare outsprinted her the last quarter of a
mile, winning in a hard drive by half a
length. Chimura ran a close third.
Fashion Plate, a mild choice for the
closing mile selling run, managed to get
away from the post none too well, losing
by a head to Croker. The latter horse was
a 5 to 1 chance in the betting.

in the city and had rooms at the Palace
Hotel. After ho had gone for some dis
tance he claims that a woman pulled him
Into a room and closed the door. Sdon
afterward a male accomplice entered and
gave battle to the drummer. He severely
assaulted him nnd then robbed him- of an
overcoat, ICO In gold coin and several val
uable sample watches. which ho had In hia
possession.
As soon as possible Stewart escaped
from the room and gained the street, nut
all trace of the pair was gone. The po
lice have since been working on the mat
ter, and last night arrested Felton as be
ing the accomplice of the woman. The
woman herself !s well known on Barbary
Coast, but since the robbery has disap
peared. Stewart Is anxious to recover the
sample watches, as he says they are very
expensive and cannot be duplicated.
YACHT ASSOCIATION
WILL STILL EXIST
OAKLAND, April 10.â The California
Yacht Club will not withdraw from the
Pacific Coast Interclub Yacht Association.
This course of action definitely decided
upon at a meeting of the California Club
members held this evening means that the
association will be granted a lease of life
for another season, as the Encinal Yacht
Club had determined to folldw the lead
taken by the Callforrflas. Withdrawal of
these clubs would- have ended the asso-
elation.
Dissatisfaction on the part of the Cali
fornia and the Encinal Yacht clubs arose
from the fact that while the principal ben
efit derived from membership In the as
sociation was the privilege of racing for
the Macdonough cup, the yachts entered
have to be In the 30-foot class, and neither
club has such a yachti Membership thus
costs about $40 a season, for which there
was no return even In sport.
Ex-Commodore Clay reported to-night
that he had been assured the dues for the
season hereafter would be restricted to
$10. This fact taken In connection with
the probability that hereafter the gift of
Macdonough will take the form of several
trophies induced the club to remain a
member of the association.
The club also took the Initiatory step
to-night toward arranging for the "low
links to be held on the evening of the
28th Inst. In celebration of the opening of
the yachting season by appointing the fol
lowing committees: Entertainmentâ J.

Should Neill win he will be able to adt*
to his present title that of champion mid
dle-weight boxer of Australia, which Mur
phy now holds. Neill is training at the
Terminal, corner of Halght and Stanyan
streets, while Murphy has chosen tha
Casino, a quiet retreat on the e<lge off
Golden Gate" Park, opposite Strawberry
Hill.
whlch Is a shade above the normal weight
of each of them. The match being of so
much importance from a pugilistic point
of view, the bout will be held In Mechan
ics' Pavilion to accommodate all the spec
tators who may wish to attend. The date
is the 27th inst. - The affair will
be managed by the National Athletic
Club.
There is hardly a shade of difference be
tween the two men except in height,
where Murphy has two Inches the better
of Neill. Their reach, or spread of arms
from tip to tip. is the same â seventy-two
inches. Nelll has half an Inch greater
chest measurement and can expand four
Inches, while Murphy contents himself
with an expansion of two inches. Al-
though a casual observer would pronounce
the Australian lighter In the waist than
his opponent, the tape shows only an Inch
more to the credit of Nelll than to Mur
phy. There Is only a shade difference in
their underpinning, both possessing legs
sufficiently sturdy to carry them in safety
through the severest of contests.
The men are to box at 134 "pounds,
duced there in recent years. His name Is
bracketed with those of Fitzsimmons and
Hal], who were once in the middle-weight
class, and with Jackson, the peerless
heavy-weight, as the best of the great
boxers developed In the colonies. The
comparative measurements of the boxers,
piven herewith, show how closely matched
are the rival middle-weights. They are

PAWNED TOO MUCH "OLD GOLD."
BENJAMIN C. BERGEN, a weigher
In the United States Branch Mint,
â¢was arrested last evening by De
tectives Ryan and O'Dea as he was
entering the Zinkand. Cafe. He -will be
turned over to the Federal authorities this
morning and will be charged with robbing
the Mint.
It is claimed that the young man, who
ccrr.es from a good family, has been sys
tematically stealing gold bullion from the
weighers' department for several years,
end it is estimated that he has robbed
the Government of many thousand dol
lars.
Bergen operated eo cleverly that his
thieving has puzzled the Mint officials
ever since it was discovered that buluon
v.as disappearing at a rate that was glv-
Sr.g alarm. As a weigher he bandied the
Fold samples before they were filed away.
With the aid of a pair of Jeweler's shears
or "snippers," used by the weighers, he
pinched off small particles from nearly
every sample that he handled. He con
cealed these bits of bullion In old en
velopes. The amount taken from each
bar was go small that the loss was not
easily detected, but in the aggregate his
flaily stealings amounted to considerable.
When he was arrested he had several en
velopes containing particles of gold in his
pocket.
D;tected by Accident.
Bergen's detection was. In a measure, a
matter of accident. Superintendent Leach
had been much worried over the unex
plained disappearance of bullion from the
Mint and employed Detective Harry
Morse to locate the culprit. A represen
tative of the latter's agency has been
working on the case for some time, but
without success.'
A few days ago Detectives Ryan and
ODea of the Southern Police Station,

quest of stolen articles, marveled at the

EARLY DELINQUENT
TAX ROLL FAVORED
Supervisors' Printing Committee Will
Recommend Immediate Action to
Prevent Sales to the State. Â¦JBSJ
The Supervisors' Printing Committee
decided .to recommend to the board that
the delinquent tax list be published at
an earlier date than has been the custom
heretofore. Deputy Tax Collector Salo
mon explained that if the list was got
out early it would save expense to the
city, because the sale of property for de
linquent tuxes to the State would be
greater if the llf.t was delayed. On ac
count of errors made In the records of
the former Tax Collector the taxpayers
would be anxious to investigate the de
linquent roll.
It was further decided that a large dis
tribution of the roll should be made in
order to give the public an opportunity
to settle delinquencies before making
Bales to the State. The City Attorney
will be requested to decide whether the
official advertising includes the publish
ing of the delinquent roll or whether the
contract must be let independently to a
daily newspaper having at least SOQP cir
culation.

den, Who Was Stabbed to Death
by Young Wayne Harris.
The funeral of Andrew Layden, the mes-
Eenger boy who died last Saturday morn-
Ing from the effects of wounds inflicted by
Wayne Harris, another messenger boy,
took place yesterday noon from the un
dertaker's. The services were simple but
impressive. The striking feature of the
occasion was the presence of a large num
ber of the fellow messengers of the dead
lad. The pallbearers were all messenger
boys in the full uniform of the A. D. T.
There were many floral offerings. The
body was interred in Holy Cross Ceme
tery. The dead boy was 22 years of age.
The Coroner's Jury yesterday In the In
quest on the body of Andrew Layden, the
messenger boy who died on. April 7 from
the effects of a knife wound inflicted by
Wayne Harris, rendered a verdict charg
ing Harris with manslaughter.

BYRON JACKSON.
great amount of "old gold" that the
registers of several three-ball establish
ments showed had been pledged by "J. B.
Smith" and "J. R. Hans."
Suspecting that it was the fruit of the
robbery of Jewelry stores or dental of
fices, they took samples and visited near
ly all of the leading establishments of the
city. They were told that the quality of
the gold was far finer than that used in
the manufacture of Jewelry or the plug
ging of teeth. The matter was then re
ported to Chief Sullivan, who told the de
tectives that Superintendent Leach of the
Mint had complained that the institution
was being systematically robbed. Mr.
Leach at once pronounced the gold bul
lion of the same quality used in making
Uncle Sam's coin. Receipts given the
pawnbrokers by "Hans" and "Smith"
were at once recognized as being in the
handwriting of a Mint employe.
The detectives got a good description of
the man and ascertained that "Smith"
and "Hans" were one and the same.
Yesterday when the Mint employes were
leaving work Ryan and ODea watcbed
the line and picked Bergen as the man
wanted. They followed him up Market
street, to reassure themselves that they
had made no mistake, and as he was
abcrut to enter a saloon, placed him under
arrest. He was somewhat startled, but
pulled himself tog-ether and put on a bold
front. He stoutly proclaimed his inno
cence, denied he had signed the receipts
which le<l to his detection and declared
the whole affair was a case of mistaken
Identity. He was taken to Haslhall's
pawnshop, 10 Sixtji street, where he was
Identified by the proprietor rs the man
who had been pledging bullion at his
place for many months.
Evidence of Guilt.
TvTien taken before Chief Sullivan Ber
gen declined to talk until he had seen his
attorney, Henry C. McPike. On his way
down to 'the tanks" he voluntarily pulled
the en\'elopes from his pocket, containing
chips of gold similar to those found in the
pawnshops, and handed them to the of
ficers.
After a long consultation with his attor
ney Bergen declined to make any state
ment for publication. At a Third street
pawnshop it was found that he had real
ized SS2 SO on "old gold." while the Sixth
street shop purchased to the extent of
$130. The detectives state that nearly
every large pawnshop In the city has
some of the stolen bullion.
The prisoner is a son of Attorney Benja
min F. Bergen of MKKJVi Broadway. Oak
land, and has been employed In the Mint
for the past six years as weigher at a sal
ary of 1125 a month. He Is married, re
sides in East Oakland and has a family.
Among his fellow employes Bergen does
not bear a good reputation. It has been
known that he has been playing the races
extensively, and in order to keep up the
pace borrowed money from every one who
was foolish enough to loan It to him. He
was an Inveterate gambler and inclined to
be an all-around sport.
OAKLAND. April 10.â Superintendent
Frank A.' Leach was seen at his residence,
iAI Hobart street, Oakland, this evening,
and F.iid:
"About a year ago it was drawn to my
attention that chip gold, as taken from
bars by the assayers, was being sold to
pawnshops. 1 investigated this matter.at
the time, but was unable to learn any
thing because the pawnbrokers refused to
permit me to see the gold they had
bought. Last week I heard of the sale of
assayers' gold again, and reported the
matter to the police. Detectives Ryan
and ODea were put upon the case. Ryan
learned that gold In this form had been
sold at five different pawnshops, and, se
curing specimens, submitted them to an
expert. He pronounced it assayers' gold.
"In every case the description of the
man selling the gold answered that of
Bergen. The detectives secured the re
ceipts given the pawnbrokers, and though
different names were appended to these
receipts the handwritingâ a most peculiar
style â was always the same. One receipt
was signed J. R. Hans and was for $7.
Another was signed "W. B. Smith." and
was for til. These signatures were com
pared with Bergen's handwriting and
t.ill!ed exactly. I began to suspect that
if the gold was going from the Mint Ber
gen was the guilty party.
"My reasons for suspecting him were
several. His habits were not good. He
was a confirmed card player, and I also
heard that he played the races. The de
tectives finally concluded to arrest him.
Bergen was appointed to the position of
assayer in the Mint five or six years ago
by Superintendent Daggett. I do not be
lirve he has managed to get away with
much money, because weighing showed
that very little more was missing than
would have disappeared through -ordi
nary waste and volatilization."

GOLDEN GATE
PARK IS NOW
UNPROTECTED
Police Taken From Duty to
Drill for a Phelan
Parade.
Frequent Runaways and Many Seri
ous Accidents Occur Since New
Charter Went Into Work
ing Operation.
There was a wild runaway Ui Golden
Gate Park yesterday and the beneficial
(?) effects of the new charter, as applied
to the management of the park police,
was Indignantly discussed by over a hun
dred people who narrowly escaped from
injury or death. The driver. In a light
vehicle, lost control over the beast some
where out near Strawberry Hill and not
until Baker street and Golden Gate ave
nue were reached was he able to obtain
mastery again. All that distance the ve
hicle swayed from side to side of the main
drive, causing a wild commotion among
pedestrians and drivers. That no one was
killed was short of a miracle.
AH* this time the park police were doing
the "hay-foot, straw-foot" act down in
the Stanyan street police station to the
dreary "right, left, right, left" of a drill
master. But the police personally are not
to blame. Before the new charter went
into effect the mounted police of Golden
Gate Park were under the direction of the
Park Commissioners. A finer appearing
body of horsemen It would be hard to find.
The horses were of good speed and the
equipment was up to date In every re
spect, while the men were neatly clad In
becoming uniforms. They were the pride
of Golden Gate Park. Then, as now, there
were many runaways, but the men were
always on hand and rarely was it that
the rope of the horseman failed to bring
the runaway to a quick halt.
Now Phelan Has Power.
But things have changed since the new
charter went Into effect and Phelan,
through Chief of Police Sullivan, obtained
control of the police of the park, who
are now under the supervision of the head
of that department. The change has not
been for the better; it has been for the
worse. Only one or may be two of the
police in the park are now provided with
mounts, and these are old, crippled, slab
sided skates, borrowed or furnished (un
der the charter), that can scarcely
keep up with their own shadows, as &
gentleman who frequently drives out ex
pressed it. Captain Thompson, who for
merly had charge of the park police, one
of the best riders there, has been given
an old roan plug that for the past four
years has done duty carting off brush and
hauling a bobsled when not doing service
pulling the lawn mower. And on such as
this are the officers expected to head off
runaways. The Park Commissioners can
frame ordinances for the benetlt of the
public, but they have no means of en
forcing the same, as they are without
jurisdiction over the police. The efficiency
of the park police service has been utterly
destroyed.
Another Cause of Complaint.
Another cause of complaint on the part
of those who frequent the park is the
removal of the emergency hospital and
police station from the central district of
the pleasure resort. The former haa been
done away with entirely and the latter
has been removed to Stanyan street. A
few days ago the entire force of pro
tectors was taken from duty and sent
downtown somewhere to be measured for
new uniforms and was away from the
beats from 1 to 4 p. m. Yesterday the
park was in the same condition, nearly
every policeman performing military an
tics at the command of a drill master In
the station outside the grounds. It was
then that the runaway occurred. It was
also then that another serious accident
happened and no one in authority to give
a helping hand. A lady became mixed up
with a bicycle and was seriously Injured.
The nearest hospital was at the City Hall,
two miles and a half away, and not a
doctor to be had within a mile. The lady's
companion was obliged to lift her on his
back and carry her to a roadside resort
until he cou'.d summon help from the city.
All this time the police were drilling
preparatory to making a showing for a
May day parade at which his Honor, the
Mayor, will appear in all his glory near
the head of the column. In order to be
ready for this municipal show It has been
decided to hold several drills and It Is
understood that the police are to be taken
from duty every Saturday afternoon, the
liveliest time in the week, excepting Sun
day. Even after the parade the drillo
will be held twice a month and on drill
days it Is expected that the mortality
and accident rate will be materially In
creased. It will be advisable for children
and nurses with babies to keep away from
danger and the park.
No Longer a Safe Resort.
For years Golden Gate Park has been
recognized as a special spot for recrea
tion and pleasure, where women and chil
dren could go with safety. But that was
before the new charter and Phelanlsm
came Into operation. The very nature of
the country â hills, dales, bushy slopes and
hollows and shady grovesâ lnvites the evil
minded also, and without proper police
protection the garden of the West would
become a breeding ground of Iniquity and
crime from the panhandle to the beach.
When It becomes unsafe for women and
children to visit, as it soon will be at
the present rate of police protection (?),
It would be better to convert It Into a
municipal cowpasture.
When the Park Commissioners had Jur
isdiction and authority over the park seri
ous runaways were scarce and criminals
were driven from the big pleasure ground.
Wounded and suffering people were quick
ly cared for. Since Phelan has charge of
the whole business, as permitted by the
new charter. Golden Gate Park will not
only be unsafe, but an object of com
miseration on the part of visitors . and
the public.

STRANGE CASE OF
CHINESE ORDERED
TO BE DEPORTED
Court Commissioner James
of San Jose Cancels a
Certificate.
Revenue Agent Thomas Says That
the Paper Is Genuine, but Judge
James Charges Fraud in
Obtaining It.
United States District Judge de Haven
has taken under advisement the habeas
corpus case on behalf of See Ho How.
alias How Tim, a laborer residing in San
Jose. The case is one of the most peculiar
that has ever come up before him. the
transcript sent up by Court Commissioner
James at San Jose revealing a most re
markable condition of affairs and mods of
reasoning and adding greater circulation
to rumors that have been circulating
about the Federal building for some time
past.
Commissioner James ordered How Tim
deported to China in defiance of the fact
that Tim produced before the Commis
sioner his certificate of residence. No.
fc.6 376. issued by O. M. %V elburn. per F. C.
Joslyn. on April 7. 1894. On this certifi
cate appears the name, age. marks, de
scription and photograph of See Ho How.
alias How Tim. The duplicate of this cer
tificate was found by Special Internal
Revenue Agent Burt M. Thomas In the
archives of Internal Revenue Collector
Lynch and Mr. Thomas declares It to be
a genuine certificate, and says that the
photograph and description are those of
See Ho How. alias How Tim. The China
man swore that he had lived in Santa
Clara County for the past twenty years,
and offered to bring Charles George of
Hobson's store in San Jose to testify that
he had known Tim for more than twelvu
yars, but Commissioner James, according
to his own statement in the record, re
fused to allow Mr. George to be called and
sworn and canceled the certificate on the
ground "that any testimony offered tend
ing to show" the length of time that the
witness (Tim) has resided in this country
would not be material in this case."
Commissioner James states further in
his record: "From said evidence adduced
before me it appears that said cer
tificate of residence was procured to be
issued by fraud, misrepresentation and
false testimony, and I order him deport
ed. The testimony showed that he did
not reside in Oakland, and that the wit
ness who swore to the facts upon which
the prisoner obtained his certificate was
a stranger to him." :â¢:.â¢;>Â«â¢Â«Â¦,?;Â«
The only requirement of the law for ob
taining a certificate of residence was that
the applicant at the time of the issuance
of the certificate was a resident of the
United States and of the district in which
the certificate was issued. As the certifi
cate was issued to the defendant person
ally he must have been a resident of the
United States and therefore entitled to
receive It, notwithstanding any perjury
or misrepresentation that may have been
made outside of that fact. Â¦Â¦:Â¦..Â¦-â¢-::->
BRIDE OF A
JOURNALIST
Miss Bessie Maddern and
Jack London Wedded
in Oakland.
Mr. and Mrs. Henry Maddern have sent
out cards announcing the marriage of
their daughter, Bessie May Maddern, and
Jack London, celebrated in Oakland on
Saturday morning, April 7. The happy
groom is a well known journalist and
magazine writer, and his bride a beautiful
and accomplished young woman.
Plenty Water, but Not for Veterans.
For the past ten years the Veterans'
Home at Yountville has enjoyed the un
disputed use of a large spring on the home
grounds near the western boundary. Re
cently a survey has been made of the
property and It was found that the spring
Is fully 100 feet west of the true boundary.
The property owners on which the spring
Is located have torn up the water mains
which supplied the home and the water is
now running to waste. Secretary Scoville
of the Veterans' Home sent an inquiry to
the Attorney General to learn if the
spring can be condemned for the use of
the home. Dtputy Sturtevant writes that
the spring belongs to the owner of the
land and cannot be molested without his
consent. Before condemnation action
could be brought the Legislature must
make provision for the compensation of
the owner. Under the circumstances it is
doubtful if the property can be condemned
at all, as there is no law providing a fund
for such a purpose.
A Painter's Bad Fall.
George Riding, a painter, residing at 4
Willow avenue, fell a distance of forty

both ankles. He was engaged in painting
a house on the corner of Sutter and

pened. He climbed up the side of the
house by means of a stationary ladder
and when near the top a rung broke and
he was precipitated to the ground. He
was removed to the Receiving Hospital

TAX COLLECTOR SCOTT
REFUSES DISPUTED TAXES
He Exacts the Legal Penalty on De
linquent First Installments From
Banks Without Success.
Pursuant to resolutions adopted at last
Monday's meeting of the Board of Super
visors directing the Tax Colllector to ac
cept portions of taxes when .the full
amount was disputed by the taxpayer, the
Bank of California and the Union Trust
Company yesterday tendered the sums 01
$36,419 and $7000 to Tax Colllector Scott,
which had been refused by his predeces
sor, Sheehan. 'Â¦'. . Â¦ >
Scott was obliged to decline the tender,
however, because the concerns refused to
pay the 15 per cent penalty for delin
quency. They explained that the money
was offered lq proper time when the Orat
installment became due. and that in an
agreement signed by Sheehan et al. It was
expressly understood that no penalty was
to be exacted.
Scott, however, would not accept the
second tender because he has been
charged on his books the 15 per cent ad
ditional by the Auditor. The matter will
be called to the attention of the Super
visors, who will be asked to provide the
necessary relief.
Fischer's House of Melody.
Fischer's concert-house is continuing
its success in giving to the public high
class music at an admission price of 10
cents. It is probably the handsomest
amusement house of the kind in the
United States. The quality of the music
furnished Is of the very best and the
wonder Is that such entertainment can be
provided for such a price. This week
the Lambardi Opera Company is pleasing
crowded houses and doing much toward
building up the reputation of the new and
deserving institution of amusement. ThU
week the best features of the cpera "Cav
alleria Rusticana" are presented in su
perb style and are highly appreciated by
the public. The orchestra, under August
Hlnrichs, has made a distinct hit and is
entitled to special commendation. The
coming programme will be varied in or
der that the taste of the general public
may be thoroughly satisfied.
Pawned Missing Instruments.
C. F. Clark was last night . arrested by
Officer J. Terrlll and placed In the
"tanks" of the City Prison pending an In
vestigation Into his peculiar conduct. He
Is said to have pawned two sets of valu
able, pocket surgical Instruments which
were unlawfully in his possession. Dr.
W. F. Osnum of 1604 I>eavenworth street
reported the loss of similar Instruments to
the police and Officer Terrill had been
working -on the case. He was notified
that Clark had pawned a third set of in
struments and he discovered his where
abouts and placed him under arrest. He
will probably be charged this morning.

THE TELEPHONE ORDINANCE.
SUPERVISOR MCCARTHY'S ordinance pro
viding that telephone companies shall furnish
to the patrons of the nickel-in-the-slot tele
phones the desired switch before exacting the nickel
from them promises to furnish the public with re
lief from a long-standing abuse. Several efforts to
accomplish the same object have been made in the
past with no success, but this time there is a fair
prospect the ordinance will be enacted and that in
operation it will prove effective and beneficial.
It is the contention of the company that it cannot
obey such an ordinance, nor carry out the require
ment of furnishing the switch before demanding pay
for~ the service, without increasing its present force
of employes, but the claim appears to be ill-founded.
At any rate, the number of additional employes re
quired will not be large and their wages will be but
a small percentage of. the enormous profits of the
company. It is likely, therefore, that what the tele
phone corporation really objects to is not the in
creased amount it will have to pay out for wages,
but the number of nickels it will lose when deprived
of the privilege of practicing the old form of extor
tion.
The bill has been passed to print by the Super
visors, and it appears no objection has been made to
it on the score of illegality. It will have, of course,
to run the gauntlet of the Mayor's veto, but even
that danger seems to be slight in this instance. The
subject has now been under consideration a long
time, and ample opportunity has been given for de
vising a measure which will stand the double test of
practicability and legality. The McCarthy ordinance
has every appearance of being such a measure, and
the public will with justice demand that "the Super
visors and the Mayor give it that cordial and faith
ful support which is necessary to obtain for it a fair
trial. . ?
The passage of the ordinance will naturally revive
popular interest in the movement for an amendment
of the charter so as to give the Supervisors power to
regulate telephone charges. It will be remembered
that when proposals for taxing the telephone com
panies upon their slot machines were under considera:
tion an ' official of the company tauntingly declared
that if the tax were imposed the corporation would
exact the amount from the public by putting it in the
bill. Something of the same sort may be resorted to
in this case. In fact, the chief point in all discussions
of the relations of the telephone corporations to the
municipality at this time is that of giving the muni
cipal authorities ample legal power to supervise such
corporations, just as corporations operating other
public utilities are supervised and regulated. Until
that amendment of the charter has been adopted all
that the Supervisors can do will afford but inadequate
protection to the public.
BOSH AND BUNCOMBE AND PROB
ABLY BOODLE.
WHEN the Railroad Commission met on Mon
day and went through the form of giving con
sideration, to the complaint of John C. Moore
cf Fresno against the recent action of the Southern
Pacific Railway Company in raising passenger rates,
Chairman Edson gravely read a paper to this effect:
"In the matter that is before us to-day on the complaint
of Mr. Mbore of Fresno there are questions of vital
importance to the people of the State. This board
is a. constitutional body created to perform certain
duties prescribed by the constitution, which the
board cannot and should not evade. We must
realize that we have the brightest intellects in this
State to contend with, and what we do must be done
with deliberation. 'Be sure you are right, then go
ahead,' is a safe maxim. This is ,what we must en
deavor to do, and the people of the State will know,
in due time, that this board will shirk no responsi
bility, but will investigate the whole matter thor
oughly and will render a decision in accordance with
the law and the facts, and will not hesitate to stand
for the rights of the people. In my mind there is no
question of the jurisdiction of the board in this mat
ter, and we should to-day map out a course of pro
cedure that will cause us to make a final decision as
soon as possible."
"In the name of the prophet â figs." The only way
in which anything could have been added to the pre
tentious hypocrisy of that document would have
been to open it with prayer and close it by singing a
doxology. Th|re is, moreover, a sort of grotesque
humor in the thing, for the Commissioners are not
going to "stand for the rights of the people," and the
people know it, and the Commissioners are aware
they know it. It is a bit of hypocrisy played before
the public for no other purpose than that of making
the play. In fact, as soon as the paper had been read
a motion was made to postpone consideration of the
matter, and the motion was carried and the commis-
son adjourned.
The worthlessness and falseness, the futility and
imbecility of the commission are matters of common
fame. It is well known the members of it receive
orders from the Southern Pacific Company, and that
they do not wait for orders to be sent them, but go
to ask for them, sometimes openly to the railroad
ofnee and sometimes secretly to the wine room of the
Herrin residence. Knowing all that, the people ex
pect nothing of the commission, and the Fresno com
plaint was doubtless made, not with the expectation
of relief, but with the intention of putting the com
mission once more upon the pillory of popular scorn.
So complete is the evidence of the uselessness of the
commission that there exists a widespread demand
for its abolition. In an open letter published in The
Call yesterday upon "Political Responsibility of Cali
fornia Farmers," J. S. Taylor, lecturer of the Cali
fornia State Grange, in referring to the desire of the
farmers for economy and honesty in State administra
tion, said: "They want to know why the State Rail
road Commission does not exercise the authority
given it under our laws in preventing the railroads
of the State from raising their rates for transporta
tion when it suits their convenience. If this com
mission cannot be made of service to the public, it
fhould be abolished"
To that question of the farmers Commissioner Ed
fon's paper comes with the answer, "We must real
ize we have the brightest intellects of this State to
contend with." Truly the people are aware the com
mission has very bright intellects against it, and
seemingly no intellects at all within it, but e.ven that
docs not sufficiently account for the utter stagnation
and inactivity of the commission when flagrant out
rages against the law are committed. Honesty and
fidelity do not require any great amount of genius io
make a fight for justice, neither arc they frightened
even.' time they see a "bright intellect" against then.
It is likely, therefore, that back of the bosh and
buncombe of Commissioner Edson's paper there is
something of no little potency â something which the
Commissioners receive along with orders when they
make visits to the Southern Pacific office or the Her
rin wine room.

DIFFERENTIAL HEARING.
THERE is ground for believing that the hearing
given to the merchants oT San Francisco has
impressed the Interstate Commerce Commission
that the demand of the coast jobbers is in line with
the natural laws of trade and transportation. While
the Middle Westers loaded the issue with many in
tricacies, it is probable that the Commissioners saw
in this that their contention is for a purely arbitrary
and artificial interference with natural law 6.
If the rate policy of the railways is to be in the in
terest of one section of the country and against all
others, why not in the interest of one man and
against all others?
The natural law of trade is to bring consumption
and distribution together. The Middle Westers pro
pose to keep them apart and to use the railways for
that purpose.
We can say with fair certainty that the commission
will not support that vie*

A MIGHTY ISSUE SETTLED.
NOW that we are approaching a Presidential
campaign, which will revive and intensify agi
tation upon a host of problems, questions and
issues, it is gratifying to learn by reports from Wash
ington that a matter which has long been tormenting
and confusing to a considerable number of our people
and has disturbed not only domestic life but even the
placid channels of slow-moving diplomacy has been
settled. It is announced that high authorities at the
capital have fixed rules of precedence for all officials,
and there is no. longer to be wrangling and discord in
stately halls as to who shall go first when the butler
announces "Dinner is served," or some other grave
function is to be observed.
It will be remembered that not long ago a bril
liant and august company was invited to a high re
ception given by a lady of eminence to Admiral
Dewey. It was designed to be an occasion of dignity
and joy, but it turned out to be one of wrangling and
pain. It appears the cards of invitation bore an in
scription announcing to the guests that they were in
vited "to meet Admiral Dewey." The words may ap
pear harmless to the uninitiated, but in Washington
they were felt as a bitter, stinging wrong. The sub
lime rules of etiquette forbid an Embassador to
"meet" anybody. An Embassador is the representa
tive of a sovereign. People of all ranks must go. to
meet him; he cannot condescend to meet them.
Therefore an invitation to meet Dewey was in the
nature of an insult to high diplomatic dignitaries at
the capital, and they treated it with a scorn so blast
ing and so cold it was felt as a blizzard all over the
Atlantic coast.
That was the most severe of recent sad occurrences
resulting from a lack of a definite and well understood
etiquette at Washington, but it is not the only offense
of the kind. Alas! they have been only too frequent
Hardly a month passes without reminding Washing
ton society of the fatt that it has become only half
Europeanized and is still afflicted with raw Ameri

Paderewskt's refusal to play at Sacramento after
scats had been sold for the performance is one of the
offenses for which the law does not provide an ade
quate remedy. A return of the money paid for seats
is not always a full satisfaction, for often other ex
penses have been incurred. When a long-haired bird
has promised to sing and can sing he should be made
to sing.

a seat in the Senate is under certain conditions worse
than buying a gold brick under any conditions.

along the western coast until a month
later than they are staying this season.
In these words Sylvester Rogers of Al

places on the way East are now crowded
from basement to the roof, whereas the
rush of travel _from the West does not

it has this year. . . â¢ . ;:Â¦.-
"On the train from 'Frisco." said he at

mitted that they were simply, fleeing from
the Asiatic plague which, without any
doubt at all. Is now to be found in San

a few cases of the plague, but that there
is even , one case is enough' to frighten
away many tourists' who/ all their lives,
have heard of how deadly this plague is
and how rapidly : it spreads- when intro
duced into any country. Â¦
"Every precaution is being taken, I have
been informed, to guard against its spread
and even to make light of the fact that
there are now cases of plague in San

train there was the least contagion, the
bubonic plague would spring up in prac

try simultaneously. The danger, though
small, is great when the seriousness of
the disease is taken Into consideration.
"The - authorities in all probability will
stamp out what little of it there Is, in

"TOURISTS FLEEING FROM
PLAGUE STRICKEN SAN FRANCISCO"
THE AUSTRALIAN MAIL CONTRACT.
BY the action of the Postmaster General in
awarding the contract for carrying the Austra
lian and British closed mails between the
United States and Australia to the Oceanic Steam
ship Company another evidence is given of the
superiority of the San Francisco route to and from
Australasia and the United States and Europe. The
mails of course are forwarded by the shortest, quick
est and safest route available, and it was only by
demonstrating its superiority in these respects over
competing lines that the Oceanic Steamship Company
obtained the contract.
The award is certain to give satisfaction to the pub
lic, for the Oceanic is one of the oldest and most re
liable steamship lines upon the Pacific, and its carry
ing service can be relied upon for speed, certainty
and efficiency. The regularity of the mails will there
fore be assured as far as anything can be which is
liable to the accidents of the world, and the advan
tages, to the commercial community will be notably
great.
The service is to begin with November.
Steamers are to touch at Honolulu, at Apia or
Pago-Pago in Samoa, as the United States Govern
ment may direct, and at Auckland. It is to be noted
that the Oceanic Company has also arranged with
the Tahitan Government for a steamship service
eleven times a year between San Francisco and-Ta
hiti. That will give our merchants and manufac
turers a" new means of extending trade with the isl
ands, and is therefore an enterprise of great impor
tance to the port.
There is talk in New York of running Otis for the
Vice Presidency on the Republican ticket, but the old
General has had running enough after Aguinaldo and
ought now to have a rest.
CALIFORNIA'S OUTLOOK.
/CALIFORNIA has no hard-luck story to tell.
( The commercial record of the recent dry year
was a record of progress and not of shrink
age. The products that are yielded by the soil did
not, as a whole,\diminish in volume nor in iÂ»alue.
Here and there some of the agricultural and horti
cultural crops failed, but elsewhere their yield was
normal, or increased, so that the general average and
the average increase were maintained. The experience
induced economies that were accommodated to the
shrinkage where it occurred in individual cases, and
when the account of the year of drought was made up
and balanced, it proved to be a fat year and not a
lean one. There was no cause in it for any pessi
mism, nor complaint of hardship, nor foreboding of
evil to come. It was superadded to the experience
of the State in bearing its share of the hard times that
began in 1893. But California bore that with no
failures in business that tapped her strength, and with
not a failure in banking that could be charged at all
to financial conditions. The only bank failures had
their origin in illegitimate banking, and conduct that
would bring failure in the best of times.
When we consider the infrequency of accident to
agriculture and horticulture here, the certainty that
is in all rural industries, and put beside them the fre
quency of accident to crops in the East, by frost, by
dry and wet weather, occurring untimely between
seed time and harvest, it may be stated as an un
impeachable fact, that California is the surest and the
kindest place in all the world, for those who live upon
the soil.
Our wealth in the land and the water is in the be
ginning of its development. The water that laps our
coast is full of marine wealth that has scarcely been
touched. One animal alone that sports in our bays,
the porpoise, carries in his hide a fortune of hun
dreds of thousands, that no one has yet begun to
reap. On the Atlantic seaboard the porpoise has
been almost exterminated, to secure the finest water
proof leather that is made. To show the riches ready
to be won in what are regarded as small things, por
poise shoestrings are eagerly sought at a dollar and
a quarter a dozen, wholesale. With mining in
Alaska in its infancy, there is already a demand for
waterproof leather footwear that is best supplied by
porpoise leather, and that will grow steadily to great
proportions. We mention this only as one instance
of the resources that are yet untouched by our peo
ple. The same could have once been said of each of
our industries that are now permanent features in our
economy. We say with certainty that California offers
the greatest variety of gainful occupations to be
found anywhere in the world. Our industries sing no
solo. Their song is a chorus of the grandest .volume.
Our people may be chidden for too much talk about
misfortunes that are imaginary, and for the magnify
ing of backsets that elsewhere are taken as matters of
course and not worth complaining about.
Where all nature is bountiful, abundant, optimistic,
buoyant with hope and big with promise, carping
and complaint by man have no proper place and
should cease.
If a roll of the rich men of the State is called it
will be found that every fortune made here, every
competency gained, has been by men who always had
confidence in the future, and laid plans regardless of
to-day's passing wind or weather. If they were in
fruit- and a new predatory bug appeared, instead of
chopping down their trees they killed the bug. If in a
mine that pinched, while others let go they held on,
and drove a drift till they rediscovered the ledge. If
in trade they shed no tears over losing an old mar
ket, but found a new one.
In this State wind and tide are always in the tail
and never in the teeth of hope and enterprise.
Therefore let Californians have done with hard-luck
stories. There is no hard luck here. Politicians may
say there is, but their saying, has a purpose that is for
their personal gain, not for the public good.
Eastern men, who are charmed with every prospect
here, are unfavorably impressed by the tendency of
Californians to growl and grunt. Let us assure them
that the cause of it is not in any existing condition,
but is in the discontent of the Californian that he can
not live forever, in this best climate, on the most
fruitful soil and in the midst of the most inspiring
scenery on the planet. As he can't have it all, al
ways, the Californian regards translation to paradise
as a forced migration to a less pleasing country, and
at bottom his way is simply discontent with what is
to come, not with what is.
forward. Now it is announced the end has been at
tained. Washington is to have a court etiquette, even
if it have no court, and there are to be royal man
ners, even though royalty be present only by the
proxy of an Embassador.
We are told that "the intricate problems have re
ceived the careful consideration of the highest au
thorities, and the round of social festivals will be in
augurated next season under a simple and easily
comprehended system of rules. The imperative neces
sity of adjudicating the claims of the "Speaker of the
House and the President of the Senate has compelled
the promulgation of a new and regular order of pre
cedence. * * * The new rules will take as the
basic principle the triple co-ordination of the powers
of government in this republic."
. The harmony which is to follow these rules will not
be a glad harmony, however, for the further infor
mation comes that it "will not be inaugurated with
out passive resistance by these gentlemen (to wit, the
Embassadors). The Government may be a trinity,
they say, but the executive is its only visible and ap
proachable semblance. The Embassadors hold that
this rule will violate all international customs. But
the fiat will go forth, and next year there will be no
trouble to decide whether Mrs. Justice should call on
Mrs. Senator, or otherwise. It will be plain sailingf
at least, on a hitherto stormy sea."
Let us hope for the best. If the coldness produced
by the rules prove too cold on the stormy social sea,
the atmosphere may be warmed up by firing a couple
of Embassadors, or three if need be.

HUNTINGTON GENEROUS
TO FOREST PRESERVERS
Gives One Thousand Dollars to Help
Impound Flood Waters of the
State.
C. P. Huntlngton yesterday gave the
California Water and Forest Association
$1000 to assist in the work of impounding
the floods of the State. The association's
finance committee had previously secured
subscriptions amounting to $7600 from the
banks of the city and the, representatives
of various lines of business. Many had
promised to donate If the railroad, which
will be largely benefited In the matter of
freights If the valleys of the State can be
Irrigated, would contribute. Accordingly
a committee, consisting of William Thom
as, T. C. Frledlander, F. W. Dohrmann
and A. R. Briggs, called on Mr. Hunting
ton In the yellow building. Mr. Thomas,
as president of the Water and Forest As
sociation, explained the purposes of the
organization. The first thing to be -done
wan, he said, to make a contract, with the
Federal Government, the State and Stan
ford Universities and the Water and For
est Association as parties, the universities
agreeing to furnish services, the Govern
ment to furnish services and' money and
the association to furnish money.
The first work would be a complete sur
vey of some particular locality and the
ascertaining of the cost of work at that
place. The figures could be submitted and
such a plain and clear showing made that
it would constitute a strong argument to
bring aid from the Legislature. Mr. Hunt
lngton said that the plan was good. He
then subscribed JIOOO personally, but said
that the work Was foreign to the railroad
company. The committee thanked Mr.
Huntington _and withdrew. They hope
now to make a total of $10,000 in sub
scriptions in a few days.
ADVEBTISEMENTS.
French Cruiser Protet, on
Her Maiden Voyage,
Arrives Here.
Stopped at All the South and Central
American Ports on Her Way.
Is Bound for the Chinese
Station,
The French cruiser Protet arrived in
port yesterday morning and saluted the
Stars and Stripes flying on Alcatraz as
ehe passed up the bay. She is a vessel of
the latest type and is now on her maiden
cruise, her destination being the China
station. As she steamed up the bay the
warship was very much admired, and
there is sure to be a rush to see her should
her commander throw her open for in
spection.
The Protet Is classed as a second-class
cruiser. She was built of steel and
eheathed with teak in Bordeaux and
launched in 1803, but did not go into com
mission until June, 1899. Her armament is
composed of four 16-centimeter guns, ten
10-centimeter guns, ten 47-millimeter guns,
four 87-millimeter guns, two torpedo tubes
and four searchlights. She is 331 feet long.
68 feet beam and her displacement is 4055
tons. Her triple expansion engines drive
her at a speed of 20Vi knots.
The Protet left Rochefort, France, on
June 5, 1599, and since then has stopped at
Madeira, Rio de Janeiro, Montevideo,
Buenos Ayres and Punta Arenas; thence
through the Straits of Magellan to Valpa
raiso and from there to the island of Juan
Fernandez. Nearly all the crew went
ashore there and visited the spots made
famous by Defoe In his "Robinson Cru
soe" adventures.
From Juan Fernadez the Protet went to
Coquimbo, Iquique, Callao. Guayaquil,
Panama, San Jose de Guatemala, Santa
Rosalia and San -Diego. At all the ports
mentioned the officers and men had a good
time, and they expect to enjoy- themselves
for a week or ten days In San Francisco.
From here the Protet will go to Honolulu,
if the plague has been stamped out, and
thence to Hongkong via Yokohama-
Captain Paul Germinet is the chief In
command on the Protet. On his arrival in
Chinese waters he will take command of
the fleet and the Protet will be the flag
ship. Captain Miron de l'Esplney is In
command of the cruiser, and with him are
Lieutenants Colliard, Hue, Escudeer, Che
lot, Labarre and Doney. The Protet car
ries a crew of 400 men all told.
Stowaways on the Moana.
There are three men on the Mall steam
er Moana who consider that fate has dealt
severely with them. After succeeding in
stowing 1 away at Sydney, N. S. W., and
getting as far as San Francisco without
mishap they find themselves prisoners and
destined for the journey back to Sydney
agrain.
Their names are J. J. Ford, J. Mahoney
and J. Tlngley. When the Moana was two
; days out from Sydney they were discov
ered. At Auckland they could not be
landed because of the plague, and the
same reason held good at Apia and Hono
lulu. Here they could not land because
they are penniless, so the officers of the
ship have them under lock and key and
they will be taken back to New South
Wales and given another chance in that
colony.
To Have Her Trial Trip.
The handsome new steamer Robert Dol
lar is to be tried on the bay to-day. She
was built for the coast lumber and pas
senger trade, but the rush to Nome has
gathered her in, and as soon as the ma
chinery and gear Is proven to be in satis
factory order ehe will go to Puget Sound
to be fitted out for the passenger trade to
the gold fields. The Robert Dollar is built
on the same lines as the Grace Dollar,
but is a larger and more powerful vessel
than the well-known coaster.
Wachusetts Storm-Tossed.
The ship "Wachusetts, which left Hast
ings Mill for Melbourne In February last,
arrived at her destination a few days ago
after a very tempestuous voyage. She
ran into a series of heavy gales and final
ly sprang aleak. The ahip wu in no Im
mediate danger, but the crew had a hard
time of it at the pumps. The Wachusetts
will be drydocked and overhauled before
coming back to San Francisco.
Water Front Notes.
Captain Alec Swanson, the Adonis of the
pilot service. Is now an expert checker
player. While in quarantine on the Cen
tennial he learned all about "crib," and
while detained at Angel Island on the
Sheridan Captain Pearce undertook to
teach him checkers. When the vessel was
released Alec had mastered the game and
was beating his teacher two out of three
games.
The ship I. F. Chapman will sail for
Honolulu to load sugar for New York to
day. She has a makeshift crew and there
is sure to be some fun aboard before the
voyage ends.
The steamer Bloemfonteln arrived from
Hawaii yesterday and was placed in quar
antine. She has been running between
Honolulu and Puget Sound, but comes
here on this occasion with a load of sugar
for Alexander & Baldwin.
Chief Engineer Ed Mahoney, who has
been for years on the steamer Sunol. has
been appointed chief engineer of the Santa
Fe's steamer Ocean Wave.
There is a rush to get freight aboard the
barkentine Catharine Sudden for Nome.
Merchandise that goes up on her will be
landed a week ahead of any other vessel,
it Is expected, as the vessel Is tnklnjr up
all the latest machinery for handling
freight. The tug Dorothy, that is to ac
company the Catherine Sudden, will be
launched to-day.
Japanese Interpreter Appointed.

them the fatal Helen, the source of dis
aster, ruin and shame: when all the eager
fighting is done It is hard to see that there
Is, any worthy end to it all, and a great
darkness awaits warriors and wanderers,
the entire human race, as It passes out of
sight into mystery.
It is not because Dante holds in a me
chanical way to a life beyond death that
his poem seems to the thoughtful reader
more fraught with hope and Inward Joy
than that of the Greek world. It is be
cause here and now he reveals eternity.
Reading him we feel how wonderfully life
has been enriched, how Its scope has
broadened, how many new elements have
entered it, as the race has gone on living.
The range of emotion, of aim, of experi
ence, both in Joy and sorrow, is widened
beyond all words. It is of little use to
make an assertion like this without prov
ing it, but one must read Homer and
Dante to see whether the thing Is true.
The love of woman in Dante Is no longer
a devouring fate, a bitter cause of strife;
it has become holy, and It leads men up
to God. Suffering is no longer the strange
blight imposed upon the race by a mys
terious fate. Mysterious stillâ how oth
erwise?âit is yet fraught with redemp
tive power. An end of joy beyond all hu
man thought awaits the wanderer. The
best of enduring happiness that the an
cient world could conceive is recognized
and given a place in Dante, but so has
man's power of imagining Joy risen
through the ages that this old pagan hap
piness is by Dante actually put within the
limits of hell. The elys^an fields, the para
dise of antiquity, the happiest future for
virtuous men that Homer or Virgil could
dream of, are In his underworld. There
live forever all the noble men who knew
rot Christ. They rest from their labors:
they wander on enameled meads; they
abide in majestic dwellings: they share
high converse undisturbed by wrath or
fear. Nor Homer nor Virgil could con
ceive a higher Joy. But Dante knew a
higherâ a heaven of ecstacy and rapture
Into which no pagan poet ever might soar.
He haa been reproached for leaving his
great heathens in limbo, and we may re
gret that he put them there, but at least
we must recognize that he gave them all
they had ever wished. In fullest measure.
The epic of antiquity, the epic of the
outward life, will always have a wider
appeal than Dante. It will always possess,
in a Bense, more action, variety, actuality
and charm. Yet every dispassionate read
er must recognize, whether with Joy or
sorrow, the new regions entered and ex
plored by the soul of man and the new
treasures brought from within between
the time of the "Iliad" and "Odyssey"
and the time of the "Divine Comedy."
There would seem at first sight to be
more points of likeness between Milton
and Dante. The "Paradise Lost," like the
"Divine Comedy," Is a religious, a Chris
tian, epic; both poems have for their
theme the fall and the redemption of man,
both present wonderful pictures of hell
ond heaven. Yet, though they are indeed
most Interesting to compare, the longer
one studies the more striking becomes the
difference between the poems.
We must note at the beginning that,
historically spcakiu?'. Milton subtends a
much smaller arc than Dante. Dante Is
the poet of universal Catholicism; Milton
the poet of English Puritanism of the sev
enteenth century. We should expect to
find, as we do find, a certain coldness, cer
tain limitations, mingled with much that
is exalted and noble in its poet. A very
special type of theology, a type which did
not endure very long the test of time, un
derlies the Intellectual structure of the
"Paradise Lost." Milton Is extremely anx
ious to justify this theology which he
honestly considers to be the full expres
sion of the will of God. He starts out, as
he deliberately tells us, "to Justify the
ways of God to man." It would never
have occurred to Dante that the ways of
God needed justification. In the "Divfn<Â»
Comedy" Dante moves adoring in a world
revealed by faith: In the "Paradise Lost"
Milton presents eloquently a world con
ceived by theology. It is a very different
matter.
It follows that there Is a deep personal

SAWMILL DISPUTE
BUZZING IN COURT
The Pokegama and the Klamath Com-
panics Making Golden Sawdust
for the Lawyers.
The Pokegama Sugar Pine Lumber Com
ber Company vs. Klamath River Lumber
and Improvement Company is the title of
a suit filed a few days ago in the United
States Circuit Court for an injunction and
an accounting.
The complainant is in the lumbering and
sawmill business at Klamathon, Sisklyou
County, and has had some litigation in the
State courts and in the United States Cir
cuit Court concerning a lease with Hervey
Lindley and the defendant corporation.
In the present suit the complainant al
leges that the defendant has violated the
injunction heretofore ordered by the court
by refusing to allow the complainant the
exclusive use of a barn and hostler's room
on the premises, and asks for an account
ing and that defendants be enjoined from
prosecuting ' any suits against the com
plainants In the State courts.
HEART DISEASE
Some Facts Regarding the Rapid In-
crease of Heart Trouble.
Heart trouble, at least among the
Americans, is certainly Increasing and
while this may be largely due to the ex-
citement and worry of American business
life, It is more often the result of weak
stomachs, of poor digestion.
Real organic disease Is Incurable; but
not one case in a hundred of heart trou-
ble is organic.
The close relation between heart trouble
and poor digestion Is because both or-
gans are controlled by the same great
nerves, the Sympathetic and the Pneu-
mogastric.
In another way also the heart Is af-
fected by the form of poor digestion,
which causes gas and fermentation from
half digested food. There is a feeling of
oppression and heaviness in the chest
caused by pressure of the distended stom-
ach on the heart and lungs, Interfering
with their action: hence arises palpita-
tion and short breath.
Poor digestion also poisons the blood,
making It thin and watery, which irri-
tates and weakens the heart.
The most sensible treatment for heart
trouble Is to Improve the digestion and
to Insure the prompt assimilation of food.
This can be done by the regular use af-
ter meals of some safe, pleasant and ef-
fective digestive preparation, like Stu-
art's Dyspepsia Tablets, which may be
found at drug stores, and which contain
valuable, harmless digestive elements in
a pleasant, convenient form.
It is safe to say that the regular, per-
sistent use of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
at meal times will cure any form of stom-
ach trouble except cancer of the stom-
ach.

BAY COAST ROAD
MAY NOW OBTAIN
ITS FRANCHISE
City Attorney Lane Holds a
i Charter Provision to
Be Untenable.
Supervisors May Not Deny the Ap
plication to Enter City Because
the Company Has Not Fifty
Miles of Track/
The City Attorney yesterday informed
the Board of Supervisors that the charter
provision which states that "the Board of
Supervisors shall have power (subdivision
20) to allow any transcontinental or other
railroad company having not less than
fifty miles of road actually constructed
and in operation to enter the city and
county with its road and run its cars to
the water front at the most suitable point
for public convenience" is" untenable in
law. The City Attorney was asked to re
port upon the petition of the Bay and
Coast Railway Company for" permission to
operate a double track eteam railroad
along and upon certain streets. The com
pany not having at the present time titty
miles of road entering this city was re
fuaed thÂ» franchise by the Supervisors,
but under the Interpretation of the City
Attorney permission to enter the city may
now be granted.
The opinion, which is very interesting,
reads in part as follows:
One possible construction of this provision
Is that It is thereby intended to prevent the
entrance into this city and county of any
railroad not having fifty miles of road in
operation at the time when the franchise is
applied for. But the language of the sub
division is not of a character to make evi
dent such Intention: it is not in any sense
initiatory, and it is not to be readily be
lieved that it was the purpose of the char
ter makers to shut the gates of this city
against all railroads except such as could
show an established line longer than that
from San Francisco to San Jose. Such in
terpretation would bar further elec
tric and steam railroad connection with all
the suburbs of the city to the south and
five a permanent monopoly in such traffic
to the roads already existing. The charter
does not elsewhere contain evidence of so
extremely conservative a purpose aa would
be manifest under such construction. And
It is to be seriously questioned if such pro
vision would not be contrary to State pol
icy and beyond the scope of a municipal
charter.
A more reasonable construction than that
Just considered is that subdivision IS was in
tended as a protection against the acquir
ing by "paper" railroads of valuable rights
along the water front; that it was a recogni
tion of the supreme value to the city of its
harbor and expressive of a determination
to Drevent railroads that were constructive
but not constructed from obtaining privi
leges along the water front, which might
later be sold to the highest bidder without
the building of a single mile of track. Un
der such construction It would appear that
the Intention was to reserve such privileges
for those roads which are of a transcon
tinental character or which at least extend
for a considerable distance In the country.
In conclusion, the theory that all rail
roads whatsoever were intended to be ex
cluded from the city excepting those with
fifty miles of road already built is unten
able; the construction which makes the pro
vision a limitation but only applicable In
roads extending to the water front is not
one upon which there is occasion to express
any opinion at this time, for the applica
tion for a franchise here involved as
amended does not extend the road to the
water line. It appears, therefore, that
there is no provision of the charter limiting
the power of the city to grant applications
of this character.

HOMER, DANTE, MILTON: BY VIDA D. SCUDDER.
Copyright, 1900,
by Seymour Eaton
GOLDEN AGES OF* LITERATURE.
XIV. HOMER, DANTE AND
MILTON.
BY VIDA D. SCUDDER.
It seems natural to group these three
great epic poets together, but at least be
tween Dante and Homer there are few
points of contact. Nothing could better
measure the distance In experience trav
eled by the human race from the dawn of
civilization to the culmination, so far. of
Christianity as the contrast between the
"Iliad" and "Odyssey" and the "Divine
Comedy."
The scene of the Homeric poems is this
earth. They show us men loving, hating,
quarreling, fighting, dying with a superb
naturalness that comes fresh to us to-day
through all the centuries since they were
written. The "Iliad" shows us pre-emi
nently man the lighter, and his foes are
of flesh and blood. The "Odyssey" shows
us pre-eminently man the wanderer, and
the hero traverses the surface of a world
still teeming indeed with marvel, yet with
all its marvels wholly open to the eye of
sense. They are glorious poems. Their
spell is cast on all who read them, from
childhood to manhood. There is in them a
joy of life, a vigor, a movement, an en
thusiasm for all the natural activities and
passions of men, which belong to the
youth of the race and which we catch
once more as we retreat within the Ho
meric horizon.
The scene of the "Divine Comedy" of
Dante is the soul of one Individual man.
We no longer follow the movement of bat
tles; we no longer sail over the world.
note in Dante's poem that we do not find
in Milton's. Milton wrote a most wonder
ful description of the Garden of Eden and
of Adam and Eve in it. This description
is one of the great things in literature. It
Is so powerful in beauty, in melody, in in
tellectual presentment, that for genera
tions it fairly imposed on the English
imagination, and although It bore little
relation to the mysterious, brief account
of paradise and the fall in Holy Writ, we
stlil to-day mix up Milton with the Bible.
And yet, with all the beauty of the de
scription, we do not feel as if Milton had
visited the place. I am quite sure that
Dante, in his own person, wandered in
that little wood, where the breeze was
blowing and the brook was flowing, on
the top of the Mount of Purgatory. I am
never, I confess, certain that Milton's own
feet had strayed through the winding
paths of his Eden.
The noblest part of the "Paradise Lost"
is the marvelously exalted yet somber
treatment of hell and of Lucifer. Every
one knows the magnificent description of
that dreary but Impressive region of the
shades; of Lucifer, "with faded splendor
wan," presiding, in dignity great as his
anguish, over his concourse of grand
though sinning demons, winging his way
in awful flight through chaos, tempting
Eve, despite a momentary visiting of re
morseful agony, and returning to hla
dark realm, only to find that he presides
by poetic Justice splendidly conceived no
longer over infernal princes but over in
fernal serpents. It is glorious work.
Dante has nothing like It. There is a
famous passage in Macaulay's youthful
essay on Milton, comparing the concep
tions of hell In Milton and in Dante, In
which Macaulay says that Milton is far
the greater because less definite, leaving
more scope for his imagination; and it
has been pointed out again and again
that Milton's hell and his devil have an
unfailing dignity and grandeur, while
Dante's are often almost absurdly gro
tesque. It is true. Nothing could be more
strangely different, for Instance, than the
conceptions of Lucifer. Dante's Lucifer
is no magnificently tragic, impressive,
though fallen angel: he is a helpless, mon
strous creature. He sticks forever, mo
tionless, at the lowest point of bell. In
the exact center of the earth; the weight
of the whole material world pressing upon,
him from every side. From his three
horrible heads flow tears that perpetually
freeze; he gnaws three chief sinners in
his three Jaws and the slow waving of his
batlike wings diffuses an icy wind of death
throughout the nethermost hell; for to
Dante, cold, not fire, is the supreme ex
pression of the second death. All this is
very strange; far less appealing than Mil
ton; yet if we think we may discover that
Dante had a special meaning and had
brooded long over the nature and function
of evil before he presented Lucifer as he
did.
Meanwhile, when we turn to comparing
the heavens of the two poets, Macaulay's
distinction becomes entirely false; one
questions if he had ever read anything In
Dante, beyond the "Inferno." For Mil
ton's heaven is a large, definite country,
with precise geography, up somewhere in
the sky. Dante's 13 definite though or
dered space. The heaven of "Paradise
Lost" is surrounded by a crystal battle
ment; the rebel angels have their country
seats in the northern part of the land;
when they are In the final conflict routed
by the Messiah they are driven back to
the battlement, and breaking through it
fall down, down through the material uni
verse of chaos till they tumble into hell.
The denizens of this country nre as clearly
visible to us as the scenery They axe
magnificent creations, Milton's angels; it
is well to compare them with Dante's,
which are quite differently and far more
mystically conceivedâ less loquacious,
less like intelligent statesmen on a heroic
scale; more like spiritual forces, focused
and made visible. There Is one point, at
.all events, and this most important, whera
no one can question which of our two
poets is the greaterâ the treatment of the
Deity. Here Milton made a great mis
take, for he brought God directly upon the
scene, made him talk, and talk, moreover,
of all subjects in the world, on theology.
The anthropomorphic method of the
"Paradise Lost" is absolutely obnoxious
here. Dante was wiser; it is not for us to
say whether his greater wisdom sprung
from deeper reverence. God in his "Para
diso" is all pervasive, and the conscious
ness of every spirit in paradise is fixed
on him alone; but he Is unapparent. and
even at the climax, where the beatific
vision is attained, we see that vision only
in a symbol, and understand its nature
rather from the wondrous solemnity of
Dante's passion than from any other
cause.
Indeed, we may as well say frankly that
out of the Scriptures no poet has ever
been successful In depicting heavenâ a
state of unshadowed light, untroubled joy
âexcept Dante. The more onÂ« studies the
"Paradlso" the more wonderful it ap
pears. And the reason why Dante has
succeeded where all others have failed is
because he alone has, so far as man can
do, discarded anthropomorphism and
adopted a method wholly symbolic. His
saints and angels do not appear to us in
the body: they are described simply by
deepening liÂ«rht. by sniftinsr. dreamlike
symbol. It Is Impossible to suggest the
manifold forms of beauty In which the
life of the blessed Is revealed. They ara
manifest as rainbows and flowers, an
dancing lijchts, as reflections In clear
water, as flying birds of light, as ruble*
in the sun. as a golden stairway mounting
upward, as a crown, as stars losing them
selves in a deepening day. as a river of
light and. finally, as a celestial roseâ the
rose of the blessed, wherein all the saints,
tier after tier, intoxicated by the fra
grance of that wonderful world-flower, sit
gazing toward the golden center, which is
God. As he sees all these Images of glory
Dante's mood is one of worship and Joy
unspeakable. "That which I was seeing
seemed to me a smile of the universe!"
he exclaims. And his Joy la essentially
not because of the beauty, not because of
the melody that ever sounds through the
ranks of the redeemed, not for any nat
ural reason, but supremely and finally be
cause this heaven Is a holy place. He has
made us feel its holiness: feel that we are
in a region where sin is ended and ban
ished, though character remains. This Ist
a wonderful thing to do. Milton did great
things, but he could not do this. Milton's
heaven Is, of course, supposed to be thÂ«
abode of righteousness; but we do not feel
IF bo. In Dante three lovely lines, near
the beginning of the "Paradise." sum up
the whole effect. "In hfs will is our
peace." says one of the least of the
blessert ones. "It is that sea whereunto is
moving all that which it creates and that
which nature makes." "Tn la sua volun

New York Stock Market,
NEW YORK. April 10.â The movement of
prices In torday's stock market largely rep
resented a contest of speculative forces for
rupremacy. The force* of reaction finally pre
vailed end the market closed decidedly weak
and at a level generally below last night*
close. This result wa* achieved after many
vicissitudes und extreme irregularity, but the
mere feet of the prifsence of an aggressive
bear clique ir. the market served as a deterrent
to the buying demand from outsiders which
has constituted the underlying ftrength cf the
market. Commission house* rrport a large
falling off In the volume of orders which have
made the market open for many days with
a rush to iniy und which served to convenient
ly absorb the profit -taking sales of the profes
sional element. This clas* of order* has either
been withdrawn t>r has been placed at a level
cf prices belcw that now existing. The opera
tor* for the decline have not yet succeeded in
bringing out any very heavy volume of offer
ings, but they work in the confidence they will
reach stop-loss orders, which will precipitate
a eudden drop all around. Tbelr effort* were
contested to-day by poor operations In a num
ber of stocks and the continued demand from
London for stocks was against them. But
the operators for a rtsÂ» seemed to lose courage
toward the close of the day and realizing In
stocks which had shown strength was very
general. These included in the railroad list
particularly the Baltimore and Ohio stocks,
Missouri Pacific and other Southwestern rail
roads, Norfolk and Western and some of the
coalers. The Industrials and specialties were
extremely active and irregular under the in
fluence of special causes. Sugar rallied sharply
from an early decline on the announcement
that the company's principal competitor had
advanced the price of refined sugars to a
parity. The stock sold off again with the
general weakness of the market. Third Ave
nue shot up nearly 10 points on the announce
ment that Its bond Issue had been placed. A
long-standing short Interest was forced to take
losses and close out, after which the stock
relapsed somewhat. Realizing by the Brook
lyn transit pool forced the stock down 4%
points from the early high level. The metal
stocks were under bear pressure, especially
Steel and Wire. The bears circulated rumors
that difficulties had been encountered in the
projected listing of the stock on the London
Stock Exchange. Continental Tobacco suf
fered from rumors of a poor showing of earn
ings to be made in the annual report which
is expected to-morrow. The Pacific stocks
suffered especially from bear pressure and
realizing and the grangers were somewhat af
fected by the forecasts of the Government crop
report, which had a bullish effect on the
wheat market. The s'.gns of discouragement
on the part of the manipulators for the ad
vance accentuated the reactionary tendency as
the day progressed and some sharp net losses
in railroad stocks are the result. A further
rise In sterling exchange to within a fraction
of the gold export point led to a discussion
of the prospect of an outward movement of
gold. The continued ease of money here would
favor such a movement, but the taking up In
the installment of the British loan which
stiffened to-day's money market in London
may be followed by a relaxation In money
rates there and a sympathetic response in
sterling exchange here.
The bond market was moderately quiet and
price changes were irregular. Total sales, par
value, $2,200,000.
United States new 4s declined % and the
old 4s advanced % and the 5s % in the bid

Dried Fruit in New York.
The New Tork Commercial says: "Holders
find it difficult to peeure sufficient business
to keep the market firm. There is, however,
no disposition to shade prices, but the feeling
Is that the really active large trade is what
might be called virtually over for the 6eason,
end comparatively nothing is stirring at pres
ent. It is probably true that a reduction in
price of a number of varieties would not call
out very important order*. Holders have aa
heavy supplies as they want, buy they do
not intend to lose much money on futures.
"Prunes have beÂ«?n advanced 'iC per pound
In California all around, and whil<? this mar
ket has not responded with any Increase in
<juotationF there is a stronger feeling and an
advance 1* probable. Holder* cannot assign
any reason for the advance, but It probably
emanates from a desire to do as their raisin
brethren do. The spot market is quiet and
eteady. and buslnt-FS is rather slack. Cali
fornia loose Muscatel raisins are neglected, and
prices are I areiy firm at previous range, whicft
is association range. The persistency with
which cutters have operated has demoralized
the market to some extent, and It is now
difficult to get a firm quotation on anything
outside of association hands or control. For
eign goods are in betfr position, and evidently
will range higher a little later.
"Peaches are not plenty, and there are con
siderable rales of peeled goods from day to
Â«iay. A good many transfers are made on
private terms, but the fact that there are
rales at all is encouraging and shows that
the crop will suffer from practical exhaustion
before the new one is ready to harvest."

HAPPY FAMILY.
When They Got Rid of the Coffee
Habit.
A little woman out in Oswego. 111.,
tell* about her husband having deter-
mined to see if he could not make her
tjnit cofTee drinking, which he believed
to be the cause of her constant neural-
gia and general nervousness, brought
home feveral packages of Postum Food
CofTee, which he had discovered, by
trying elsewhere, to be good.
She fcays: "What in the world he
brought home five packages for I could
not understand; nevertheless, I quit
cofTee and started in on Postum Food
Coffee. I did not have much faith in
the change doing me any good, but was
astonished to discover that my neural-
gia left me almost at once, and the ner-
vom troubles kept getting less and less.
"Little daughter at that time had
been iil and could eat little or nothing.
She was pale and thin. As soon as I
discovered how Postum treated me I
began to give it to her. She liked it
very much, and would drink it when
she would take nothing else. She be-
gan to pick qp rapidly and got plump
and round and rosy.
"I don't care what fort of food there
is in PoFtum so long as it treats lie as
it has. It is plain enough the food
contained in Postum CofTee is good,
'and that's all we want to know. I am
rid of neuralgia and nervousness, and
am a healthy woman. Husband has
also been improved, and daughter is
n-ell and happy, as I stated above."
.With best wishes, Mrs. Nellie Tremaa.

at one and the same Instant. The prin
cipal essayed to correct a boy for a slight
Infraction of the yard rules. The marshal
looked upon the act as an unjust usurpa
tion of authority. He remonstrated with
the principal, stating tnat he was an of
ficer of the law and had the right to ar
rest all law breakers. No satisfactory an
swer was given him. His official Ire was
aroused and he determined to arrest
Principal Suzzalo en a misdemeanor
charge for interfering with an officer.
Placing his hand upon the offender's
shoulder, he thundered:
"In the name of the Longfellow School
city government I place you under arrest.
Come along with me!"
"What's the charge?" asked the prin
cipal.
"Interferin' with an officer." replied the
marshal.
'â¢I refuse to be"
That was all the principal had time to
say. Rough-house tactics were in vogue
fof a few brief moments, at the end of
which Principal Suzzalo, much the worse
for wear, was arrested and triumphantly
led to the Longfellow School city prison,
where he Is now supposed to be waiting
for a trial.

Senator Perkins Declines to Be Dele
gate at Large to Republican
Convention.
Fp*K-sal Dispatch to The <"all.
WASHINGTON. April 10,-Senator Per
kins declines to be a delegate at large to
the Republican National Convention. He
has received a large number of letters and
telegrams from representative Repub
licans of California urging him to allow
his name to be presented as a delegate
to the Philadelphia convention. He great
ly appreciates these suggestions, but feels
that on account of his pressing public
duties here and in view of the fact that
the Republicans of the State have abun
dant material from which to choose dele
gates at largeâ men whose eminent abil
ities and high reputation and whose ser
vices to the party entitle them to the
honor of representing their State in the
national conventionâ he should not con
sent to the use of his name and that he
should cheerfully stand aside in favor of
others equally worthy of the distinction.
Senator Bard to-day presented in the
Senate the resolutions of the Fresno Bar
Association favoring the passage of the
bill Introduced In the House by Represen
tative Needham dividing the Southern

ing for the holding of terms of United
States courts at Los Angeles and Fresno.
This bill, already passed by the House,
will doubtless soon become law.
Senator Perkins has been in communica
tion with Commissioner Hermann of the
Land Office regarding the appointment uf
additional rangers for the Sierra forest
reserve. He received notice to-day from
Commissioner Hermann that George Wi
Stewart, register of the Land Office at
Visalla. had been authorized to direct the
superintendent of the Sierra forest re
serve to appoint and assign to duty it
once ten rangers for that Â¦ reserve. Com
missioner Hermann says the experience
of the Land Office proves that a larger
number of rangers are required in south
â¬rn reserves than In northern, as they
are 'n greater danger from fires, but he
expects to be able to place a larger force
of rangers In the northern reserves dur
ing the next fiscal year.

<jpf> LAMEDA, April 10.âSelf-govem
f( \\ mer.t among the pupils of the
Jl Longfellow School is working like
a charm. All the more charming
because the pupils not only successfully
carry on the discipline of the school, but
occasionally a teacher or a principal Is
haled up before the Juvenile bar of Jus
tice. Principal Suzzalo, the first to estab
lish aelf-government m a California
school, was the first to suffer chastise
ment at the hands of his own charges.
The pupils' government Is composed of
a set of officers which corresponds to that
of the municipality of Alameda. The
marshal is the king pin of them all. how
ever, and he Is clothed with authority to
jail the entire school if necessary to main
tain the proper decorum. Wilbur Lank
tree is the Longfellow"? marshal. Young
Lanktree Is a husky lad and fierce to the
backbone. No criminal ever escapes him.
He has made an ideal marshal.
Principal Suzzalo has reason to regret
this ideality, this fierceness, this huski
ness In Marshal Lanktree. for at noon
Tuesday last he bumped severely up
against each of those sterling qualities

Mabel Russell and Chris Bruno of Morosco's New Company.
TWO New York favorites coaxed from the applause of metropolitan audi
ences to add to their laurels in this city will make their initial appear
ance in the West on Sunday evening at Moroscos Grand Opera-house.
These two members of Morosco's splendW new extravaganza company"
are Mabel Russell and Chris Bruno, the soubrefte and comedian of the organ
ization. Both come direct from the Casino, New York City.
Miss Russell Is exactly; what one would wish a soubrette to beâ petite,
dainty, with large, trusting, blue eyes, a wealth of flaxen hair, and with it
all a smile and a peculiar charm that will make many a Johnny's heart go
a-thumping. But Miss Russell, however, has more than looks to recommend
her to local theater-goers. She has a' splendid voice, and excels in grotesque
and eccentric step dancing. Bruno, the new comedian, is one of the few pre
cocious children of the stage to develop Into a grown up actor. Graduating
from the dramatic stage to the operatic boards. Mr. Bruno stands pre-emi
nent as a comedian who sings well and dar.ces as well as he sings. He is a
splendid mimic, and his work Is stamped by all-round cleverness and orlgin-
Both Miss Russell and Chris Bruno' will make their .debut on Sunday
evening in the extravaganza, "An Arabian Girl."

AGENT THOMAS SEIZES
OVERWEIGHT TOBACCO
Believes That the Government Was
Being Defrauded of a Very
Large Sum.
Internal Revenue Agent Burt . M.
Thomas made an important seizure yes
terday that may result in a saving to
the Government of $50,000 per annum, and
that will cost a very large tobacco firm
In St. Louis alarge sum of money In the
way of fines.
Mr. Thomas discovered that the Wels
ert Bros. Tobacco Company of St. Louis.
Mo., had placed upon the market in small
packages what they named the Arrow
Plug Cut Tobacco. The internal revenue
stamp upon each package called for one
and two-thirds ounces of tobacco. Mr.
Thomas found that the package in reality
contained from one and three-quarters to
two nunres each instead of only one and
two-thirds ounces. As the company named
produces many hundreds of thousands of
these packages every year, Mr. Thomas
was of the belief that the Government
was being defrauded of a. very large sum
of revenue unpaid.
He seized 500 pounds yesterday from lo
cal dealers, all of the packages being
overweight, and has reported the fact to
the Secretary of the Treasury.
This is the most Important revenue seiz
ure made on this coast within the present
year.

at 920,000.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1113 JJroadway. April 10.
Thomas C. Armstrong when at death's
door looked on deeds in a manner differ
ent from the way he looks at them now.
About three years ago, under the impres
sion that he was about to die. he deeded
two parcels of real estateâ one of Hay
wards and the other of San Francisco
propertyâ to his wife, Sarah M. Arm
strong. These'deeds are to property val
ued at $20,000, and now that he has re
covered his health Armstrong wants hia
property back.
The suit for the recovery of the prop
erty came up for trial before Judge Ells
worth to-day, Langan & Lemos- appear
ing for the plaintiff and Gibson & Wnolner
for the defendant. Armstrong contends
that while he waa lying dangerously til
his wife took the deeds out of a bureau
drawer, where he had placed them, and
had them recorded. He afterward recov
ered, only to find that his property was
gone and that he was left nearly penni
less. Mr 3. Armstrong, so the plaintiff
claims, not only refused to annul tho
deeds, but excluded him from his home.
Armstrong was formerly an expressman
and later a real estate dealer at Hay
wards. He was married to a daughter of
one of the Martin brothers at San Lor
enzo nearly thirty years ago. and the cou
ple have now threÂ£ grown children.
The case was continued until 10 o'clock
to-morrow morning. As both the parties
are welt known in Alameda County, a
good deal of Interest has been excited by
the legal proceedings.

the trust business Is settled.' And Mr.
Lloyd came to me driving a bargain for
$250,000. You told me you would cut my
throat.if I exposed my secret." â¢";â¢
Here Knight's patience, temper and
self-control whistled down the, wind, and
with the memory of thearm-in-arm two
step prodding him, he ejaculated:
, "Forgive me for that."
"Me, too." cried the witness.
"Oh, I never feared you. but I did your
daughter," shouted back the attorney,
and at that remark Mrs. Craven craved
the protection of the court and demanded
an apology.
"Lots or fun," interjected Lafe Pence.
"Tell it all."
"Whom are you laughing at?" shouted
Knight. "We'll make a circus of you be
fore long and nail the witness to that trip
at Sausalito, you can bet."
Symposium of Apologies.
Â¦ Then the court was brought Into the
battle and In mild speech Judge Troutt
adjured Knight to lestraln his impetuos
ity and hold the peace. But it was only
a lull in the storm. Everybody was look-
Ing for apologiesâ the Witness, the court
and attorneys. The tempest broke out
with renewed force a moment later, when
Lafe Pence arose to object to one of
Knight's questions. Referring to all the
other attorneys on the Fair side and
snubbing Knight, Pence provoked the
latter to say:
"I don't propose to* be insulted by a
fugitive from Colorado. I want to apolo
gize to the court and I will exercise my
privilege, sir."
"We do not doubt the duty of it." said
Charles Pence, and then the court took
a hand in the game, spreading oil upon
the seething waters. When Judge Troutt
had finished and the session was finished.
Knight, with his apology, begging for
utterance, arose for the last time. He
admitted that his remark about Lafe
Pence and the refugee Insinuation was
unwarranted, as it was without founda
tion, but his ardor had not yet cooled and
led his tongue into another tangle. "Ire
gret that I said Mr. Pence was a fugitive
from justice."
This was as far as Knight got.
"Had you said that," replied Charles
Pence, "you would not now be making
apologies."
Then irate Mr. Knight went into an ex
planation of his motive for apologizing,
impressing the fact that it was not for
any other reason than. a deep respect for
the gracious court. The tempest in the
teapot had simmered over, ending with
a call from Mrs. Craven for an apology,
which Knight, with a stamp of his foot,
flatly refused. Pence offered an apology
to the court and said henceforth he would
look upon Mr. Knight as an attorney.
Mrs. Craverl then Iterated her demand
for an apology* from Knight, but all she
got was: "Never, woman, as long as I
live." .
. The case adjourned at noon and will
be continued at 2 o'clock to-day, when
Judge Slmpton will be placed upon the
stand.

and Causes That
Witness to Shake
in His Testimony*
IN the cne hour and a half session of
the Fair trial yesterday morning there
was more excitement and "hot air"
emanating from attorneys' mouths
than In all the preceding days of a
wearisome and seemingly never end-
Ing trial. Not only was the testimony of
a lively order, but a long distance vocal
Â¦duel between the Pences and George
Knight put ginger into the morning pro
ceedings and called for a judicial repri
mand, as gentle, soft and qufet in tone as
the cyclonic tongue demonstrations of the
attorneys were fierce and wild.
New Paper Introduced.
Mrs. Nettie R. Craven and Adolph Sylva
were the witnesses of the day. the former
furnishing' the motive of the breathless
.and bloodless "cattle; the latter a break in
his former story In regard to the $200
check which he testified was delivered to
lilm by Mrs. Craven in his own house at
Causalito on the occasion of her first visit.
Lafe Pence produced a document yester
day which slumped the witness for a time.
On Its face it is a one-sided contract,
signed by A. Sylva, to act as counsel for
the petitioner under the direction of her
leading counsel. The petitioner avers that
the document represents the receipt which
gylva gave her for the $200 check, and
nothing else. The paper reads as follows:
In tho Superior Court, State of California,
City and County of San Francisco.

tion of euch suit in consideration of a certain
fiEreement of even date herewith between said
Mrs. X. K. Fair and myself. A. SYLVA.
!">.Â»<Â»<* An~iiÂ«t 1 ISM
Svlva Breaks Pace
Sylva was handed the paper for Identi
fication, but he refused to state positively
one way or the other whether he had seen,
read or signed it. His memory was not so
keen and sharp in regard to this instru
ment as in other testimony which he
reeled off the spindle in his first cross
examination. Pence harassed the witness
in an attempt to secure an admission of
the exact verbiage of the receipt which
Brlrm gave Mrs. Craven for the $L'OJ check.
The latter would not commit himself as
to the expressions used, confessing that
several provisions very similar to those
in the document the petitioner's attorneys
ptrwntefl yesterday may have been in
serted in the receipt. Sylva even displayed
a disinclination to admit that the signa
ture warn his own. saying that when it was
proved he would acknowledge and not be
fore that.
The instrument on its face purports to
have been signed by Sylva and its date
appears at first view to be that of August
1, 1i.99. the day prior to the first meeting
between Sylva and Mrs. Craven in Sausa
lito. The abbreviation of "first" in the
document is not clear nor is it written leg
ibly. If the paper is what its face shows
and the date is correct it is undeniable
evidence that Sylva was prepared for Mrs.

cared for him at her lodging-house, the
Baldwin Annex. She says that she fed
h.lm and provided him with Â¦ a place to"
sleep; that even when he took her ma.
restaurant for their meals she always had
to foot the bills. He had no income-pro
ducing property, but, she says, he did
occasionally receive remittances from the
East. Who sent them or why were â¢sub
jects upon which she had no information.
Every document, paper or communica
tion that might shed light on the condi
tion of the old man's affairs disappeared
with him. He left nothing in his trunk
where he kept his belongings except a
bunch of old checks drawn on the account
of F. W. Kreling & Sons. His trunk had
been filled with letters, deeds and docu
ments. Now it is empty.
Said He Was Unhappy.
Kreling left here a week ago Friday
night on the steamer Dauntless. Antone
Pfeiffer. an old-time acquaintance, and
his son were on the same boat. They
conversed with the old man until the boat
reached Antloch. where they got off. For
some minutes before the landing was
made they were busy getting their hand
luggage together, and after the boat
reached the wharf did not notice Kreling.
The last they, saw of him he was seated
in a chair near the door of the purser's
stateroom. For all they are able to say
to the contrary, he might have gone
ashore ahead -of them or Immediately af
terward. Certain It Is that G. E.'Cam
eron, who was acting as purser that
night, did not see any one near, his cabin
door when he came out after the boat
tiM up at the wharf.
On the trip up Â« Kreling . confided to
Pfelffer that he was unhappy and never
wanted to see San Francisco again. When
the boat passed the -place- near Mare
Island where his son ..William was
drowned some years ago he became very
much agitated, and in melancholy tones
said he often wondered if he would meet
a similar fate and Inquired whether
drowning was an -easy death. .-,
The fact that his once princely fortune
had dwindled away. until in his declining
years he was almost dependent upon
others for ' sustenance seemed to prey
upon his mind. - . Â¦ ' . *
"He told me he had not slept for two
weeks," said Mr. Pfeiffer, "and appeared
to be a little confused in his. mind. ' â¢ â¢
From the time Kreling was seen on tho
Dauntless as she neared Antioch his
movements are matters of speculation and
conjecture. The Weber was at the wharf
when the Dauntless arrived. The theory
is that Kreling got' off the Stockton
bound boat, and boarded the Weber.
Was Not Seen on 'the Weber.
If he fell or Jumped, over the side of
the vessel as she was feeling . her way
through the fog near the Berkeley shore
early next morning the suction would
have drawn his body toward - the huge
paddle wheel at the' stern. 'A blow from
one Of - the ponderous blades would- have
caused the wound over the heart which.
*-i|-;HE theory of murder, with robbery
Jj as a motive, which was advanced by
J^ the Berkeley Coroner as a solution
of the mysterious death of F. W.
Kreling, is gradually losing its force, and
recent developments in the case point
strongly toward accident or suicide, with
the paddle wheel of the river steamer
Captain Weber as the engine of slaughter.
There Is no longer a question that Krel
ing left San Francisco a week ago Friday
night on the Stockton steamer Dauntless.
He was seen aboard the boat . as far as
Antioch. where the craft tied up at the
wharf alongside the Captain Weber, bound
cityward. The most plausible theory is
that the old man got off the steamer to
purchase some refreshments at a saloon
on the dork and became mixed In his bear-
Ings and boarded the Weber Instead of the
Dauntless. The boat was lost In the fog
the following morning on the trip down
and drifted near the Berkeley shore.
where forty-eight hours later Kreling's
body was found. From circumstances sur
rounding the case it Is more than likely
that he fell or Jumped overboard, was
struck over the heart by the paddle wheel
and instantly killed.
The absence of his watch, cuff-buttons
and papers, considered in connection with
Kreling's characteristics and disposition,
would strengthen the suicide theory some
what. At first the circumstances of the
missing property formed the basis of the
suspicion of murder and robbery, but in
ail the journey from San Francisco to
Antioch and the return to the scene of
death there was absolutely no opportunity
for thugs to operate. It was not impossi
ble, however, fcr the proud old man in
an effort to conceal his identity and spare
his relatives the sorrow and sting of
knowing that he had sought a suicide's
grave, to cast his valuables into the bay.
Did He Seek Surcease From Trouble.
It is certain that he led his relatives and
friends to believe he was going East for
an extended stay, when, as a matter of
fact, he did not have money enough to
buy a ticket. That his plans to take a
river steamer were not formed on the spur
of the moment is also reasonably certain.
That he took the steamer in carrying out
some definite plan is almost sure. Wheth
er that plan was to seek surcease from
trouble that had been heaped upon him
by seemingly endless litigation with mem
bers of his family or whether he sought to
escape from hiÃ relatives and the scene of
triumphs and trials and In fleeing found
death will probably remain among the
mveterles of the peculiar case.
First of all, the story that the old man
never carried less in his pockets than a
couple of hundred dollars In coin does not
agree with the statements of Mrs. Hen
rUtta Kreling, his daughter-in-law, who
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
; 1118 Broadway, April 10.
THE fullest examination of the books
and accounts of the Bank of Llver
more has failed to reveal the slight
est suspicion of a shortage. Such
was the official statement made at Liver
more this evening by Secretary C. H.
Dunsmoor of the Bank. Commissioners.
This development only tends to compli
cate the conditions surrounding the sui
cide of Henry H. Pitcher, the cashier and
manager of the Institution.
The dead financier's friends have come
to the front with the theory that Pitcher
had been wrought to a high pitch of ner
vous strain over the Varney estate con
test, and rather than go through the 6r
deal. of further extensive investigation of
the admittedly irregular transactions In
the Varney estate stocks had on a sudden
impulse decided to end his life.
) There are some circumstances which
point. to possible premeditation on the
part 'of Pitcher Sunday evening for his
deed. He carried home. from the bank a
pistol used there for protection- of em
ployesand with that shot himself. Some
time during the same evening Pitcher
mailed a document- to his, wife' in: Berke
ley.-. The letter reached the Berkeley post
office this morning .while Mrs. Pitcher was
in- Livermore attending : her. husband's
funeral.. , , .- . ? ."
That he was greatly harassed mentally
over j the .Varney case ; was known to his
associates, 1 ' although ' none in Â¦ Llvermore
nor in Oakland will admit that he gave
the slightest ground for suspicion that he
would end' his life. On the surface he ap
peared confident that he, would win out in
the contestr although the affair was drag
ging ' him into the Â¦ light of unfavorable
criticism, a situation repugnant to his
oversensitive temperament.
I Standing a3 he had for many years the
leader in Livermore's affairs, the extreme
shock- to his overweening pride was more
thamhis nature could stand. â¢ Such is the
analysis his friends make'of Henry, Pitc
her's suicide.* 'r :',''- '. - ' . - :,7
On the i other hand his co-trustees and
his legal advisers declare that ' even ,were
the contestants in theJVarney suit to win
all \ their, demands' the .financial blow to
Pitcher would not be more than he could
stand. They assert that at best the heirs
who , are * suing - could . only.; expect ;. to , re
cover >; the Â¦: dividends ; paid .- upon :the . bank
stock y and j Kennedy Â¦ mine .; stock ; . of â¢> the
estate - that was purchased by -.the s trus
tees, <â¢ besides, â¢of . course, . the stock Â¦ itself
reverting to the estate after the ; trustees
were- paid back what it cost them.;! The
theory.iof defense impressed upon Pitcher
by his attorneys was that the heirs could
not break down the Â¦Â¦ trust, unless actual
fraud were shown, and he had appeared
to accept the situation. Â¦ Â¦
Afraid at the Last Minute.
That he was afraid at the last minute
to face the court Is satisfactorily demon
strated to the people of Llvermore in his
conduct. Pitcher spent the early evening
of Sunday on his return from conference
with his lawyers, in the bank with As
sistant Cashier Fred Mathieson. Together
they worked up the statements and got
out the books which the cashier was to
use on Monday in court. , When he went
out about 10:30 o'clock he took the revol
ver with him. That evening the letter
to Mrs. Pitcher was sent. The contents of
the envelope, which was of commercial
size, have yet to be made public by the
wife, whose departure yesterday evening
for Livermore prevented" her from re
ceiving it.
While Pitcher's friends scoff at the
theory that he shot himself because he
was alarmed over the outcome of the lit
igation,'they are greatly concerned over
the deed because of the awkward position
in which, Trustees John Taylor and T. H.
B. Varney Jr. are left. Knowing that the
dead cashier was a shrewd and thorough
man of business they find themselves at a
loss to explain why -he could have com
mitted the deed at a time when he was
needed pre-eminently to assist In unravel
ing the tangle of the Varney trust.
' The bank, the trust and the estate are
practically one. All of'the fundsof the
Varney estate, save $100,000 loaned on the
Garcia ranches and some real estate in
San Francisco, are in the bank. Thomas
Varney, the founder, started it with $100,
000, and $196,000 more of, the money ha 3
since gone in and has been used in the
business of the bank. It is therefore to
the interest of both sides to maintain the
integrity of the â¢ bank. If the contesting
heirs should succeed in breaking the trust
the bank would fall to them, according to
the theory of their counsel. '
The possibility of seeing the institution
which he had builded pass out of his
hands, with all that is meant by the suc
ceeding loss of standing, was a strong ele
ment, it is believed, in bringing about the
self-chosen death of the cashier.
With the onslaught of experts at the
bank to-day there was a steady outgo of
deposits. About $20,000 was paid out to
day, making, a total of $40,000 withdrawn
by depositors since Pitcher's suicide. The
total deposits, outside -of the Varney es
tate were $64,000, hence nearly two-thirds
has been taken out. , The Â¦ bank, however,
has $10,000 more than is necessary to meet
all individual. depositors' demands.

None of the officers or deckhands on
the Weber noticed Kreling board the boat
nor do any of them remember having
seen a man answering his description on
the trip down. This has no particular
bearing on < the case, however, as the
travel between Antloch and San Fran
cisco on the river steamers is quite large.
Kreling's room at the Baldwin Annex
had been occupied between the time his
bed was made Friday morning and the
following day. This convinced his daugh
ter-in-law that the old man was still in
the city Saturday morning and could not
possibly .have been on the Dauntless.
Later she called to mind that he was in
the habit of taking a nap during the
â¢afternoons and on those occasions dis
robed as if he were going to bed for the
night. â¢ .

is hoped, that some direct evidence will
have been found pointing to the cause of
death.-" Â¦ â¢ â¢ ' â
The officials of the Coroner s office main
tain positively that the man died from
foul play. The results of their examina
tions have been given to the police of San
Francisco and Oakland for use.
The theory held by, the Alameda County
officials is that Mr. Kreling fell. into. the
hands of some one bent upon robbery;
that he was lured into some San Fran
cisco den, probably on the water front,
where he was drugged. The : blow that
caused death was then struck with the in
tention of aiding the robbery, but not
necessarily with the intention of causing
death. The blow was more severe than
was at first Intended, and Mr. Kreling
being an old man death resulted from the
shock. Becoming frightened at the result
of their act, it is believed that the body
was thrown into the bay, where it drifted
upon the Berkeley -shore owing to the
strong wind which .was- blowing at the
time. â¢ - . . . .
â¢ "Mr. Krellng met hi* death as the re
sult of foul play." said Dr. H. N. Rowel!,
the -health officer. "He certainly was not
drowned. ' There are many signs' to be
found in the lungs and other organs of a
body where death came by drowning.
There was not a single one of the many
signs of drowning that are known to
medical science present in the body of Mr.
Kreling. Death undoubtedly resulted
from the shock of the blow upon the
upper portion of the chest. That blow
fractured the collar-bone and ruptured.-. a
lot of the blood vessels and tissues around
the heart. To my mind It looks like; a
case of murder."'
Deputy- Coroner Streightif^ got â¢ Into
trouble with the reporter of a morning
paper to-day in connection with the case
yesterday. The Deputy Coroner was ac
cused of withholding news, which he de
nied. Words grew hot, until Streightlf
struck . the newspaper man, whereupon
Streightif was arrested and turned over
to Deputy Marshal Kearns. â¢ v-i'
John Taylor were merely advisers. Be
sides these. Expert Accountant W. Stew
art, representing both sides of the Varney
contest, was on hand, and Secretary
Dunsmoor of the Bank Commissioners ar
rived soon afterward. Shipments of gold
from the Bank of California were sent
down in time to meet the morning de
mand and all day there was a regular
outgo of money. There was much less
excitement at the bank, however, than on
Monday. One anxious depositor, A. Du
mas, a wine merchant of Llvermore, had
$1500 in the bank. He wavered a long
time before asking for the gold, being
hard pressed by friends, who thought he
should make sure of his standing. As
soon as his account was balanced and
the money passed out to Dumas, he was
satisfied* to hand it back and take away
his bankbook with the new credit entry.
Attorney G. W. Langan, representing
the bank, made a statement to-day of
the position of the trustees. He said:
"There are only two Items the heirs de
veloped to date â first the transaction in
the Kennedy mining stock; second, the
purchase of bank stock by the trustees.
Of the latter Taylor bought ten shares.
T. H. B. Varney, sixty shares, and Pitcher
held one hundred shares, which had been
put in his name by old Thomas Varney
when the bank was organized. Pitcher
was a man in whom Varney had every
confidence and for the first year the
bank's securities were all in Pitcher's
name. The stock had been originally in
these gentlemen's names. After Thomas
Varney's death the trustees said they
would prefer to own the stock themselves
instead of being dummies. Without tak
ing legal advice they bought it. Varney
and Taylor paid cash for their stock and
Pitcher paid $1500 cash, giving a note to
the bank for the remaining $8500. After
the sales of the bank stock the attorneys
were informed and they advised Pitcher
that the action was indelicate.
"Remember, however, that ail of these
transactions were reported in the trus
tees' accounts and were twice approved
by Superior Judge Ellsworth.
"When the Kennedy mine stock was
bought the matter stood in this way:
There was in the estate a block of 5000
shares, which was then valueless. The
trustees were advised by their attorney
that mining stock was an Injudicious in
vestment and acting on that, advice the
trustees tried to sell the stock, but found
no buyers. Finally they decided to take
500 shares each at $3 a share. Taylor tak
ing 100 shares additional for a friend. The
sales started a market for the stock and
3500 shares were taken by outsiders.
Shortly after that a lucky paying streak
was found in the mine and it paid divi
dends for a while up to $20 a share. But
suppose the stock had been held by the
estate, there would have been a com
plaint from the court If It had proved
worthless.
The Action Approved.
"Now. the action having been approved,

Craven's visit and had the paper executed
previous to that occurrence. Sylva had
already testified that he gave Mrs. Craven
but one paper in acknowledgment of the
retainer, but he would not swear yester
day in positive terms that this was an
absolute fact.
Lafe Pence went at Sylva on another
tack, trying to sift his former testimony
in regard to the accusations of jury
bribing in the deed case. Sylva could not
recollect the names of the men who came
to him during the days of the poolselllng
fight. He said that if he had a few days'
time to jog his memory he might furnish
this information to Lafe Pence. For this
reason Sylva will be recalled when he re
covers from the tiring effect of playing a
star engagement on the witness stand.
Battle of Tongues.
When Sylva had been dismissed the de
fense called for Mrs. Craven, who read
ily responded, and once again the peti
tioner was seated in the witness' chair.
Several questions were propounded in re
gard to the yellow document which Mrs.
Craven identified as a paper given to her
the day of her first visit to Sausalitoâ at
least, it was her best recollection that it
had been handed to her at that time and
was meant as a receipt for the $200 which
she had given Sylva. Knight was at the
helm, and he did not like the way the ship
was going.
"Why did you go, to Sausalito?" he
fairly yelled at the witness.
"I was advised by Mr. Dunand, my at
torney, to employ Mr. Sylva to look up
the records." was the response.
"And it took you from 1892 to 1599 to
realize that you ought to have a protec
tion of the solemnization of your mar
riage and that you owed it to the con
science of your daughter to have this sol
emnization?" came sneeringly from the
attorney's lips.
This provoked a ready and voluble re
sponse that started the engagement of
words.

ACRIMONY OF FAIR CONTESTANTS
BREAKS OUT IN FIERCE INVECTIVE
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 11, 1900.
FOUND A MAN
HIDDEN UNDER
HIS BEDSTEAD
Frederick Jackson Has Ex
citing Experience With
The Intruder on Being Discovered
Fulls a Revolver and Threatens
to Kill the Handbook
Man.
Fred Jackson, who earns a living by
making a handbook on the races, had an
exciting: encounter with a lone burglar
early yesterday morning. Shortly after
midnight Jackson went to his room on
Mason street, near O'Farrell, intending to
go to bed. After 1 caching his room he
picked up a copy of The Call which was
lying on a table in his apartments and
started to peruse it. He was smoking a
cigarette at the time, and as the butt fell
out of his hand he proceeded to look
for it.
Failing to find it Jackson- looked. under
the bed and was surprised to discover a
man who pretended to be in a deep sleep.
Suspecting something wrong Jackson
started to call for help, when the burglar
suddenly drew a revolver and threatened
to kill Jackson if he made an outcry.
Jackson after entering the room had
taken out his bank roll, amounting to
sevtral thousand. dollars, and placed it on
the table. When the desperate burglar
commanded him not to make an outcry
or suffer the penalty of being made a
subject for the Coroner Jackson, who is
noted for his sameness, bravely went to
the table and picking up the money start
ed to leave the apartments.
The burglar promptly ordered him to
"shell out" or take a chance of being sent
to the Morgue. With rare presence of
mind. Jackson pleaded with the nocturnal
visitor not to shoot, and. catching him off
his guard, he quickly left the room and
disappeared down the street. Evidently
incensed at Jackson's escape, the bold
crook cut up a new suit of clothes and a
recently purchased hat belonging to the
brave bookman.
After waiting some time. Jackson re
turned to his room and found the burglar
gone. An examination disclosed that he
had got away with a lady's gold watch,
the property of Jackson, which was
prized very dearly by him.
From the description given of the burg
lar by Jackson Detectives Ryan and
ODea of the Southern station, who were
specially detailed on the case by Chief of
Police Sullivan, are convinced that he is
familiar with the premises and knew the
time that Jackson was expected to return
to his room.
Investigation by the detectives revealed
that the burglar formerly occupied a room
in the house and was known as a "bad
man." He always carried a revolver and
was In the habit of displaying it to the
dismay of the other occupants of the
place. Tiring of his strange conduct: the
landlady ordered him to leave, which he
did. Ryan and ODea know, the fellow
and expect to arrest him within the next
twenty-four hours.
