SEES IN A VISION
THE COLLAPSE OF
BRITISH EMPIRE
Washington! April 22.â An
Intelligent!, man, who has written
books, who. has held^high official
station, who Is known 'Â¦ well as a
public speaker, receives from time
to time communications through
what he considers supernatural
agencies. This man is not a Spirit
ualist in the ordinary sense. He Is
not dependent upon mediums. Things
are revealed to him as he sits
alone. in his room. Not long ago
he had a vision which forecasted
for him one of the severe defeats
of the British In South Africa. He
saw one of the checks of Buller's
army when the- campaign to relieve
Ladysmith took its most dis
astrous turn. But the most not
able communication ol his was one
which came to him within the past
week. This is the . communica
tion:
"The coming century will see re
markable, wonderful - changes |in
governments and religion. The
different branches of the Christian
church-will comes closer to onean
other. Â¦ Love of God .will bring
men nearer to brotherhood. Sec
tarian bitterness will in a great
part be wiped out. Within the
next quarter century ' a great
upheaval ,of European, govern
ments will take place. Repub
lican "governments will- be the rule;
monarchies the exception. At the
opening .of the second quarter
century- Queen Victoria will die
very suddenly â¢ and so on. The
The Prince. of Wales will. come to
the throne. After a short reign
he will die by violence. The Duke
of York will succeed him and be the
last of the line of monarchs of
Great Britain for the present. A
republic wlll.be established in Eng
land in about flfteeK years. India
will be lost to GreKt Britain in
the meantime. After the loss of
India rapid decline of tht power of
Great Britain will take place.
France will have . comparative
peace and prosperity, with a stable
republican government for at least
twenty-five years to come."
The recipient of this forecast
has unqualified . faith - it , it. He
seeks no personal notoriety. , He

port of Cebu. Here the captain pleaded
that the, vessel was engaged in, the coast-
Ing trade, and in the transportation of
insurgent troops under compulsion, a
force of armed .Insurgents having been
kept en board continually; and, further.'
that he was constantly under arrest and
made to obey insurgent authority on the
Mindanao' coast under penalty of death
for disobedience. His statement was in
part substantiated by the original com
munications and Instructions of the insur
gent officer.
Three other vessels which had been cap
tured by the navy on December 15, 1599,
were all flying the. Insurgent flag at the
time of their capture, and were equipped
for inter-island trade. In the ; cases of
two of the vessels, the owners confessed
that their vessels were trading under the
insurgent flag, off the coast of Leyte. but
they denied the use of the flag by their
authority. In the case of the third ves
sel, it appears she had been engaged; for
nearly a year in conducting an insurgent
trade along the northern coast of Min
danao, having made many, trips to small
ports of that Island and collected hemp at
the port of Surlgao. Her many clear
ances were furnished by insurgent officers,
and the insurgent flag was displayed dur
ing the whole period of time. .
In the case of the Surlgao. General Otis
imposed a fine of , sloo, but. in;vlew of
the fact- that legitimate 'trade was .sus

VICIOUS ELEPHANT
CHOKED TO DEATH
BY HIS TRAINERS
Er>Â«c!at Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. April 22.â "Dick."
the vicious elephant belonging to
the Sells & Forepaugh circus, was Â¦
â¢ strangled to death in Madison Â¦
Square Garden to-day in an it- â¢
tempt to subdue his belligerent dis
position. "Dick" was one of the â¢
original Forepaugh dancing ele- Â¦
phants and was trained by Adam Â¦
Forepaugh Jr. nearly twenty years Â¦
â¢ ago. A few weeks ago he began â¢
showing a rebellious disposition. Â¦
When the circus reached Madison
Square Garden "Dick" became â¢
dangerous and heavy chains were Â¦
fastened to his four legs and also Â¦
to his tusks.
While preparations were being Â¦
made to-day to move the circus
"Dick" started to trumpet. . When â¢
an elephant . does this, circus peo
place say, he is likely to stampede '
the others. As there were four
teen elephants. Lewis Sells, one of
the proprietors of the show, decided
upon stern measures.
Huge ropes were passed around â¢
tho giant's body and about his
neck, a dozen men seized the ends
and began to pull, the idea being
to choke him into submission.
"Badger." a colored man. got too Â¦
near "Dick" and the latter struck â¢
him with his trunk, knocking him '
ten feet.
Finding the men made no Im
pression upon him. Mr. Sells had â¢
elenhants attached to the ropes.
They pulled with such vigor that
the ropes tightened about "Dick's"
neck and choked - him to death.
The cajcass was cut up and carted
away. It took fourteen men near
ly sixteen hours to perform the
task. The elephant was about
thirty-five years old and weighed
5000 pounds. The skin may be
stuffed and pfaced in Andrew Car- Â¦
dicatlng that he had been traveling a
long distance, but I could not ascertain
from . what point. ' The . Boer . commando
reoccupies strong positions around Spltz
kop. about eight miles northeast of
Boshof."
A dispatch to the Times from Jammers
burg, dated Saturday. says: "The Boers
are displaying renewed activity. Five
guns were used freely to-day from four
different positions against our position.
Officers and men are on duty day and
night in the trenches, and the heavy rains
of late have made their task a great feat
of endurance and pluck."
The Bloemfontein correspondent of the
Morning Post, telegraphing on Friday,
says: "President Steyn's address to the
burghers was an impassioned speech.
He implored them. to continue their re
sistance until the results of the efforts
of the Boer peace commissioners were
known." -

"An attempt is being made to confuse

of His Old Command Hear
San Miguel.
MANILA, April 22.â Last week was
one of the bloodiest of the war since the
first day's fighting around Manila, authen
tic reports.- mostly official, showing a to
tal of 378 Filipinos killed, twelve officers
and 244 men captured and many more
wounded." * The number wounded can
hardly be estimated. Considering that
the Filipinos entirely lack hospital facili
ties, a great majority of the wounded will
die. Probably the. week's work .finished
1000 Insurgents. The American loss .was
nine killed and sixteen wounded. Two ser
geants and one private were killed in am
bush while escorting provision trains.
The insurgents have been aggressive in
almost every, province in Luzon. General
Pio del Pilar's band, numbering 300, which
was out of sight for three months, the
leader having been reported killed, has re
appeared in its old field about Sari Miguel.
Pllar Is supposed to be again In command.
He gave the American garrison at Han
Miguel, consisting of three companies of
the Thirty-fifth Infantry with a Gatling,
a three hours', fight during a night attack.
The los 3 of the insurgents in this en
gagement is not included in the forego
ing total, as they removed their dead and
wounded, but presumably it was consid
erable.
Twenty-two Filipinos In the province of
Santangas attacked Lieutenant Wende,
who with eight men was scouting near
San Jose. The lieutenant and five men
were wounded and one private was killed.
Sergeant Lednius of the Thirty-fifth In
fnntry was badly v/ounded in an ambush
near Ballung. Lieutenant Batch of the
Thirty-seventh Infantry, with seventy
men, had a five hours' fight with 400 in
surgents in the Nueva Caceras district.
Twenty of the insurgents were killed.
Colonel Smith of the Seventeenth In
fantry, who captured General Montenegro
and brought him to Manila, is in the lsola
tion hospital, suffering from smallpox.
Colonel Smith's command captured ISO
officers and men with Montenegro. Mon
tenegro, who was formerly one of the
most dapper officers in the Filipino army,
looks worn and haggard. He says he led
a terrible life for months and he has of
fered to return to the north- with Colonel
Smith to endeavor to persuade his former
comrades of the uselessness of opposing
the Americans.
One hundred escaped Spanish prisoners
from the province of South Luzon have
arrived at Manila. The Insurgents have
400 more Spanish prisoners in that dis
trict. Recently the Filipinos destroyed
several rods of the railroad line near
Paniquo, In an unsuccessful attempt to
wreck a train.

Four Murders.
FUGITIVE FROM JUSTICE
President of Three Mining Companies

appears.
CHICAGO. April 22.â A remarkable se
quel to a series of alleged crimes in the
Rocky ' Mountain country has come to
light here... The Chicago developments are
told in an interview by Attorney William
Candllsh of this city In explanation of no
tices received by the Chicago police ask
ing for the arrest of George' H. Wright,
alias James S. Weeks, alias C. T. Case,
alias Mr. .Stevens, a native, of Michigan
and a graduate of the law department of
the University of Ann Arbor, charged
with having murdered four persons, three
in Utah and one in Colorado.
Candlish says he became ac
quainted with Wright because they lived
at the same Chicago, hotel, in July. 1597,
and Wright engaged him to go West and
gamier evidence" to defend him on â¢ the
charge of having murdered a man named
Crampton near Guffy,' Colo., in January,
1897. Wright then, it is alleged, -under
the name of Case, deeded to Candllsh a
bank ( building, a residence, two office
buildings and numerous vacant lots In
CriPPle Park .and,: Guffy, Colo., besides
transferring to him all his stock In va
rious mining-' enterprises;- 'Candllsh says
Case left -his ; office, to return in an hour
with $200- as advance payment on Cand
llsh's ; traveling expenses, and has not re
turned to^thts day.^The Chicago man in
terested in Case's mining property sent
Candllsh West. : however, and he exam
ined-the (Property at Cripple Park and
Guffy, -and- was' later made -president of
the Hub Hill Mining Company and of the
Fines Mining Company and counsel for
the Union Mining Company. Case had
been president of the three companies.
Case ' told ] Candlteh he was innocent of
Crampton's Â¦ death and that the charge
was an effort of> enemies and business
rivals to ruin him. A circular issued by
Sheriff George A. Storrs of,Provo City.
Utah, charges that Wright murdered
three boys in Utah County in February,
1595, and sank their bodies beneath the
ice of Utah Lake, the alleged reason of
the crime being that the boys claimed to
have knowledge of Wright's guilt as a
cattle thief. This explanation was, it is
alleged, given to the Utah State Board of
Pardons in the hearing of a pardon last
April for the Â¦tepfather of the three boys,
who had been convicted of their murder
and sentenced to be hanged, the witnesses
before the Pardon Board being the di
vorced wife of the missing Wright, whose
property and official positions have so
strangely fallen to Attorney Candlish la
Chicago, half-way across the continent.

VICTIM'S WOUND IS MORTAL
Tragedy Results From the Real or
Fancied Alienation of the Affec
tions of the Assailant's j
Special Dispatch to The CUL â !
MARYSYILLE, April 22.^John Chan*
non, landlord of the Dawson House la this
city, was shot and fatally wounded by
"W. H. McMullen. one of his lodgers, at
noon to-day. The trouble was not unex
pected, as it has been brewing for several
weeks. McMullen. who is a hostler em
ployed at the Nelson livery stable. Is of a
quarrelsome disposition and Jealous of his
wife. ' On several occasions recently he
has upbraided Channon for the latter*s
alleged attentions to Mrs. McMullen and
yesterday he accused Channon of having
caused their separation.
According to the deathbed statement of
Channon to District â¢ Attorney McDnnlel.
McMullen approached him tonlay and
again accused him of having alienated his
wife's affections. Again Channon denied
the charge. Finally both men agreed .to
go to Mrs. McMullen's room and let her
decide as to the truth or. falsity of the
accusation. Mrs. McMullen's mother.
Mrs. Granier, was present when the men
entered the room. Channon say 3 he put
the question to Mrs. McMullen. and she
made positive denial that he was in any
way accountable the separation of
herself and her husband. McMullen
shouted: "You He!" drew a revolver and
shot Channon in the left side just below
the heart. The men wete only three feet
apart and Channon's clothing and flesh
were badly powder burned. The wounded
man grappled with Mcilullen. who wan
trying to shoot again, and succeeded in
wresting the pistol from him, when out
siders separated them. McMullen then
went to the police station and gave him
self up.
The prisoner's story to the police is quite
different from Channon's. He says he
went to his wife's room and found Chan
non standing by her side with his hand
resflng on her shoulder. He accused
Channon of having come between him
and his wife, and says that Channon be
came angry and finally picked a heavy
object from the table and threw it at him.
It struck him on ' the head and almost
stunned him. causing him to sink to his
knees. He says Channon was about to
strike him again when he drew his pistol
and fired. He exhibited a deep scalp
wound in substantiation of his story. The
women corroborate Channon.
Surgeons found that the bullet passed
through Channon's body, the point of exit
being about one inch to the left of the
spinal column. He cannot recover.
Channon is a married man. his family
living in the house where the trouble oc
curred. He formerly was engaged in

OF THE ADVANCE
OF LORD ROBERTS
London Military Experts Believe
'the ForwaM Movement Is
About to Begin.
Patriots Will Make Their Stand Between the
Invading Army and the Transvaal
Borders.
MASERU, Basutoland, April 22.â General
Brabant's advanced guard reached Bush
mans Kop last evening:. The Boers held a
strong position there with two guns. The engage
ment opened at sunrise with heavy rifles. At 6:30
A. M. cannonading began and continued for sev
eral hours. General Brabant's forcas are on the
plain and have fairly open country all the way to
Wepener.
Evidently the Boers reattacked Colonel Del
gaty to-day. Colonel Delgaty heliographed : "All
well. Boers fired 300 shells yesterday withour
doing much damage."
MASERU, Basutoland, April 21, evening. â Four
Boer guns have been nard at work all day on Col
onel Delgaty's position. The British guns have
replied at intervals. The Boers are divided into
three divisions, two being in positions to repel the
relief columns, the distant roar of whose artillery
is audible. General Brabant's relief force is re
ported to be to-day in the neighborhood of Bush
mans Kop, twenty miles from Wepener.
The Basutos are posted on the border for de
fensive purposes. They are behaving in orderly
fashion, but are showing the most intense interest.

Special Cable to The Call and New York Herald. Copyrighted, 1900, by
the New York Herald Company.
LONDON, April 23. â Now that fine weather continues to be reported
from Bloemfontein, the general feeling here is that news of Lord Rob
erts' advance may be received at any moment. '
General Rundle, with the Eighth and Third divisions, advancing
from Reddersburg to Dewetsdorp, had a hot encounter at Orlogs
pcort on Friday. It is stated that General Rundle was unable to make fur
ther progress, but the true explanation probably is that he is waiting for
the movement of Lord Roberts' troops from the north and General Bra
bant's from the south before striking. The Boers appear to be in great force
and determined to make a resolute stand.
General Brabant's force, advancing from Rauxville. engaged the Boers
at Bushmans Kop. twenty miles from Wepcncr. He has with him not only
the Colonial division, but also General Hart's brigade, four battalions
strong, dn;wn from the Natal army.
Another indication that Lord Roberts' advance is near at hand is the
fact that Lord Kitchener is busy making various disciplinary changes, which
â¢will, it is expected, result in perfecting any inadequacies in the organization
of the system which his vigilant eye has observed.
Beyond a few small affairs of outposts near Glen and Bosmans Kop.
nothing of importance has taken place in the immediate neighborhood of
Bloemfontein. The Boers continue their sniping tactics, but the general im
pression in the British camp appears to be that the burghers will make no
determined stand south of Brandfort.
Fighting reported in the neighborhood of Boshof bears out the view
expressed by a military expert that the Boers are determined to offer to
Lord Roberts the most vigorous resistance of which they are capable. For
tome time past a part of Lord Methuen's force has been holding an ad
vanced position at Zwaxtkoppiefontein, northeast of Boshof. On Friday
they found their security menaced by 2000 Boers under the command of a
son of General Cronje. When the column retired a determined attack was
made upon the baggage train. It failed, owing to the skill with which the
operations were conducted on the British side, but it is obvious that the re
tirement was effected just in time. The fact 'that the Boers necessitated a
withdrawal at all is conclusive evidence that they have not lost their dar
ing, nor did they fail to appreciate the danger threatening their extreme
right by the massing of a British force, composed entirely of mounted
troops, at Boshof.
It is to be noted, too. that the Boer guns were busy again on Saturday
shelling the Elands Laacte collieries, a fact which seems to dispose of the
previous report that they had been withdrawn from Biggarsberg. All things
considered, therefore, some heavy fighting may be expected very soon.

RAIDERS PROVIDING HORSES FOR ROBERTS' ARMY.
LONDON. April 22.â The Stan-lard publishes a long dispatch from Bloemfon
tcin. dated Friday, explaining the numerous difficulties which tend to delay the
Cdvancp to Pretoria. The correspondent says:
"Enormous transport difficulties are enhanced by the rainy weather and by
the necessity of providing for the needs of the army for weeks, perhaps months,
in case of an interruption of the long line of communications, together with the
unsettled state of the country in our rear and the guerrilla tactics of the enemy.
It is obvious that until our flanks are cleared and no longer menaced no forward
movement is possible without incurring thÂ« gravest risks.
"The roost pressing need is a further supply of horses. General Hamilton has
availed himself of the services of the Australian bushmen to scour the Free
State in all direction?, buying horses from farmers who have surrendered, and
driving In animals found upon unoccupied farms. Horse raiding Is dangerous
work, but the bushmen are more than a match for the Boers."
REPORT THAT GENERAL DEWET IS DEAD.
LONDON. April 23.â The Daily News has the following from Lourenzo Mar
ies, dated Friday, April 20:
"It is reported here that General Dewet has been killed. Other European am
bular.ee corps besidrs the Irish-American are taking up arms In behalf of the
Boers. The latter are unable to obtain smokeless powder. Trenches are being con
structed for t-lÃht miles around Pretoria. There arÂ« Pixty-nine guns in position at
Kroonstad and seven French guns at Pretoria. Twenty-five mines at Johannes
burg have been charged with dynamite and the Johannesburg fort has been dis
mantled.
BOERS HAVE EIGHTY THOUSAND MEN.
LONDON, April 23.â The Lourenzo Marquez correspondent of the Times, under
Saturday's date, says: "Information received from responsible sources shows'that at
one time the two republics had 105,000 men In the field. Including the colonial rebels.
According to the same Informant they can still muster Â£0,000, of which 50.000 are in
the Free State. 10,000 are in the Biggarsberg district and 15,000 in the district of
Fourteen Streams and Klerksdorp. It Is now believed that before the war the
burgher list* were deliberately falsified in order to deceive the British intelligence
department."
DECISIVE BATTLE MAY HAVE BEEN FOUGHT.
LONDON. April 23.â 1t Is quite probable that by this time General Sir Henry
Bundle has fought a decisive battle with the Boers. He Intrenched himself on
Saturday to await the arrival of General Campbell with the Sixteenth Brigade.
That commander arrived on Saturday evening and news may, therefore, be ex

Miss Pohlmann Is now at her home in

Miss Pohlmann, who has for fourteen
years been a member of the German Bap
tist Church of this city, became matron of
the Sonoma Hospital in July, 1899. She re
signed early In March. She now resides
with her mother at 66 Sharon street, in
this city.
Miss Pohlmann declared that no girl
who valued her honor could work under
Dr. Shearer. He was a very bad man, she
declared, and tried to corrupt all the
women about him. She had intended,
she said, to let the matter drop after her
resignation and avoid scandal, but Rev.
Mr. Gaston. who had heard of the matter,
had actedâ had written and told her it waa
her duty to present the facts to the
Board of Supervisors. After thinking over
the matter carefully she had conclude I
he was right, and that perhaps. If the
truth became known, further evil might
be averted. She made an affadavit and
had Miss Sundell do likewise.
Miss Pohlmann said that she and Miss
Sundell both complained to the Board of

board took no action, and she and her

they became convinced tne board would

THE HEALTH HABIT.
Just as Easy to Form as Any Other.
Vie do not deliberately form our* pet
habits, but they are unconsciously ac-
quired and prow as we grow, and by the
time we learn they are hurtinjr us. we
find them too stronjr to be easily broken.
Then, why not form a good habit, a
habit which will counteract the many bad
ones, in other words contract the unfash-
ionable habit of being always well.
The best health habit to get into is to
have and keep a vigorous stomach; if you
have a healthy digestion you can drink
your beloved coffee, smoke your favorite
brand of tobacco, with little or no harm;
the mischief begins when these things are
forced upon the faithful stomach, without
any assistance.
Form the habit of taking after meals
some harmless but efficient digestive
which will relieve the stomach of so much
extra work.
Nature furnishes us with such digestives
and when they are combined In such a
pleasant preparation as Stuart's Dyspep-
sia Tablets, they give the overworked
stomach just the necessary assistance to
nccure perfect digestion without any of
the harmful effects of cathartics and sim-
ilar drugs.
The habit of taking Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets after meals is as necessary to the
wtak stomach as' food itself, and indeed
to get the benefit from food eaten, noth-
ing better and certainly nothing safer can
be used.
Many families consider Stuart's Tablets
as essential in. the house as knives and
loiks.
They consist entirely of natural uigest-
ive principles without the effect or char-
acteristics of drugs: they have no cathar-
tic action, but simply go to work on the
food taten and <i!gest it.
Take into account your bad habits and
the expense they entail and then Invest
fifty cents In a box of Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets and see If your digestion" for the
next month is not vastly improved.
Ask the clerk in any drug store the
name of the most successful and popular
stomach remedy- and he will say "Stu-
art's."
RIVERA WILL
RESIGN FROM
CUBAN CABINET
Outcome of the Island Pa

It Is Predicted That the Other Sec
retaries Will Soon Follow the '
HAVANA, April 22.-General Ruls Ri
vera, Secretary of Agriculture, has had a
long Interview with Governor General
Wood regarding the letter which he wrote
urging a union of political parties and a
unanimous, demand for independence by
the end of 1901. General Rivera will prob
ably resign early this week from his of
ficial position.
The Cubano predicts that 'the remaining
Secretaries will do likewise, as it is recog
nized that General Rivera holds a power
ful influence.
In the course of the interview General
Rivera Informed Governor General Wood
that he had not meant any personal dis
courtesy, but that he Is of the opinion
that he would prefer to be untrammeled
by office, so that Tie might speak out his
mind on political matters without embar
rassing the Government.
The members of the Cabinet are still
considering where they stand with re
spect to the recently expressed views of
General Ruis Rivera. Most of them feel
If they do not resign the" will be looked
upon by Cuban voters as being neglect

on tho other hand, they feel that. If they
should resign, they would not only lose
their salaries, but also that their places
would be occupied by members of the
Democratic Union party, which repre
sents the conservative element, together
with all the autonomist organizations.
With the exception of Senor Villalon, the
members of the present Cabinet are
members of the National party, and they
would dread the effect of a new party

FIVE-YEAR-OLD
BOY TORTURES
A BABY GIRL
Brutally Kicks the Little
One and Attempts to
Hang Her.
Massachusetts Lad Who Rivals the
Notorious Jesse. Pomeroy in the
Intensity of Youthful â¢
Depravity.
?
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON. April 22.â A crime, which in
the intensity of youthful depravity has
not been paralleled since the days of the
famous Jesse Fomeroy. has shocked the
city of Fall River. Little Jennie Brooks,
who lacks two months of being 3 years
of age, was assaulted and mercilessly
beaten and cruelly . tortured by a play
mate named James Clayton, who Is only
5 years old.
Mrs. Brooks, the mother of Jennie, al
lowed her to go out for recreation about
her home. She shortly afterward fell in
with James Clayton, and the pair were
soon engaged in play. In a short time the
youthful pair had made their way into
an unoccupied dog kennel in a yard near
by. They had not been there a great
while when James Murtaugh. aged 10
years, saw young Clayton emerging from
the kennel alone. The child called to
James and said: "Sco what 1 have done,"
laughing joyously. M&rtausb went to
the kennel and was horrified to tlnd the
little girl lying on the floor unconscious,
naked, terribly beaten and bruised, -and
about her nock a rope.
When Clayton had succeeded in enticing
the little girl into the kennel he proceeded
to strip off her clothes! after which he
punched and kicked her until he was too
exhausted to continue the work. Then he
tied a rope or stout cord about her neck.
The examination by Dr. Boylan proved
that the child was a mass of bruises from
the top of her head to the soles of her
feet. The boy admitted having caused
the bruises by kicking the littlo one. The
boy was not at all Dackward about
answering the questions of officers, -but
could give no explanation or motive for
his cruelty. The lad has a mania for such
actions. The neighbors accuse him of
having hanged cats and dogs, as he.evi
dently tried to, do to this child.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SYRACUSE, Nj V.. April 22.â Just as the
congregation was pouring out of. St. Vin
cent di Paul's Church after late mass at
noon, a white-haired man rushed up to the
church door, drew a revolver and fired
four shots Into the group of worshipers
coming down the steps. Women screamed
and men made a rush for the assailant,
who. brandishing his smoking weapon,
shouted: â¢â¢:>.Â¦ .v?-
"Keep away. I have three shots more,
and I'll put a bullet through the first man
who dares to Interfere with me."
In the momentary panic following this
threat a woman broke away from the
crowd and ran. shouting for help.
"He has threatened my life before." she
cried, "and I'm sure he means to' kill
me."
Her foot sllped and she fell prostrate at
the bottom of the church steps. Before
any one could Interfere the man strode up
to her and demanded whether she would
come home and live with him.
"Oh. I'm afraid to," she moaned, writh
ing. . '
Then the man deliberately put the muz
zle of the pistol to the woman's ear and
blew out her brains. Some one ran for a
priest, who, still In the vestments In
which ho had celebrated mass, ran out
and attempted to administer the extreme
unction to the already dead woman. The
crowd attempted to close in on the mur
derer, but was deterred by his threats to
shoot.
"This is my affair," he said coolly.
"Keep away from me or I'll send you to
hell along with the woman."
Then he broke and ran.
The murderer was John Hughes of 133
Teall avenue and the woman was his wife.
Hughes is about 60 years old and his wife
was about the same age. They had. been
married only a few months, both having
been married before. Hughes had become
Insanely Jealous, and by threats to mur

SLAYERS OF HILDNER
ARE STILL AT LARGE
Mother of the Young Man Prostrated
and Can Give No Description
of the Thugs.
LOS ANGELES. April 22.â The police of
the city have evidently made no headway
in apprehending the two footpads who
last night held up Joseph Hildner and his
aged mother on Boyle Heights, and shot
and killed the young man when he tried
to run from them. Nearly the entire po
lice force of the city Is working on the
case, but so far without results. Not an
arrest has been made.
Mrs. Hildner Is completely prostrated
from the fright of the affair and the kill-
Ing of her son. and Is unable to give any
description of the two men. No one else
saw them. It was very dark at the place
where the holdup occurred and the men
got away before Mrs. Hlldner's cries for
help brought any other person to the
spot.
J. E. Fenton, who was held \ip some
time Inter In another part of the city,
says that the men who held him up were
a "tall man and a short man and that is
as near as he can come to a description of
them. They relieved him of his gold watch,
diamond ring and $1 in money.
Governor Gage has offered a reward of
$300 nnd Chief of Police Elton a reward of
$100 for the arrest and conviction of one
or both of the perpetrators of last night's
outrage, when young Hildner was killed.
The Chief also hopes to be able to offer
a further reward of Â»200 to be paid equally

cannot be reached. In reference to the
matter the Rev. \Y. L,. Gaston has this
to say:
When Mls3 Pohlmann flret spoke to me
concerning this matter I waa dumfounded.
I knew the young lady to be of the highest
moral character. She was a member of the
German Baptist Church of San Francisco,
and the members of that congregation spoke
of her In the warmest terms of praise and
admiration. I am convinced that her state
ments are true. I personally spoke of the
matter to several members of the Hoard of
Supervisors, but nothing was accomplished
that way. probably because of the fact that
the charges were not brought in regular
form. I then brought the subject up before
the Ministerial I'nlon. We are all agreed
that Dr. Shearer should be removed from
his office. On this point we are a unit and
are taking steps to act accordlnsly. We
have talked of holding a public Indignation
meeting anil may yet do go. The condition
Â¦ of affairs brought to light by the disclosures
<if these women iÂ« outrageous. In certain
contingencies I would read the affidavits
v of the young ladles from my pulpit, and the
same thing would probably be done at the
same time In every Christian church of
Santa Itosa.
The affidavits spoken of by Rev. Mr.
Gaston are In line with a communication
Miss Sundell addressed to the Board of
Supervisors. Miss Pohlmann's containing
practically the same charges. That com
munication reads:
* To the Hoard of Supervisors. Santa Rosa,
Cal : You, the Hoard of Supervisors, who
are Interested In the welfare of the County-
Hospital, would like to know the reassns
for my leaving the hospital.
I. being a poor Klrl. making my own llv
lnr In what U known as an honest way,
tried my best to put up with what I of
course had to while at the hospital or else
SANTA ROSA, April 22.â Dr. M. M.
Shearer. County Physician, is ac
cused by two young women, former
nurses at the County Hospital, of
having used his opportunity a3 ex
offlclo superintendent of that Insti
tution to make Improper advances and
proposals to them. The young ladle? are
Miss Anna Pohlmann. now at her home.
C 6 Sharon street, San Francisco, and Miss
Bertha Sundell, at present at San' Jose.
Miss Sundell severed her connection with
the hospital on the Ist of February last,
and Miss Pohlmann followed suit a month
later, both assigning as their reason that
Dr. Shearer had made advances that made
It impossible for them to associate fur
ther with him and retain their self-re
sprct. | ; Â«\
The county Is all agog over the few In
timations already made concerning the
scandal, but the full truth will hardly be
known until the Board of Supervisors,
which seems to have been reluctant to in
vestigate the charges, is forced to their
consideration. This will be at their next
meeting, the first Monday in May, vÂ»'hen
the Ministerial Union of Sar.ta Rosa will
force it on their attention.
The social and professional prominence
of Dr. Shearer and of his family and the
good character of the two young women
who make the charges against him,
coupled with the fact that the Ministerial
I'nion, composed of the clergy of all de
nominations, has taken up the cudgel in
their behalf, gives additional Interest to
the charges themselves. Miss Pohlmani),
who Is a graduate of St. Luke's Training
School for Nurses in San Francisco, was
matron of the Sonoma County Hospital,
and Miss Sundell, also a trained nurse,
was her assistant. Both in resigning give
as their reason that life at the hospital
was made unbearable by the advances of
the venerable superintendent. Several
times.. it. ls claimed, .the nurses laid their
grievances before the Individual Super
visors, but seemed unable to get a hear
' Ing. Finally John Scoggans. a well-known
liquor dealer, while on a visit to .the hos
pital heard of the matter and reported it
to Rev. W. LÂ». Gaston, secretary of the
Ministerial Union. That body investigated
the matter and had several unofficial con
ferences with the Supervisors, seeking to
have them take up the matter. For one
reason or another the board did not do so.
Now it is proposed to force the Super
visors to some action to clear away the
scandal. Affidavits from both young
women are in the possession of the Min
isterial Union and will be presented at the
next meeting of the Supervisors, the
young women expressing their willingness
to testify in person in support, of their
accusations.

BUFFALO. N. V., April 22.â A Niagara
Falls special to the Express says: Chief
Youngs of the Dominion police, his force
of half a dozen regular policemen. 200
armed deputies and twenty militiamen
are jruarrilng the Jail at Clifton, Ontario,
where are confined the three men charge.!
with blowing up lock No. 24 at Thorold,
Ontario, lasi evening. V",
The extraordinary precautions taken
for the guarding of the men is the result
of a rumor to the eiTect that 4it> Butlalo
grain dhovelers were on their way here
to liberate the prisoners. The militia of
l ?â¢ district, the Forty-fourth BattallonJ
was warned for service. Later Mayor
Slater, with two other magistrates, made
a oerr.and for a detachment of the bit
tallon to guard the jail on the ground
that the police would be powerless.
Captain Vandersluys at once called out
a detachment of twenty men, under a
sergeant . wno were put on guard. Tney
were serveu with ten rounas of ammu
nition eaon ana are now doing guard
doty at tne jail with fixed bayonets. .Last
nigut some thought the men who blew
up the lock were Boer sympathizers. To
day the opinion has changed. It Is now
believed me dynamiters were agents for
the Buffalo grain shovelers and sought
to blow up me lock for me purpose of
disabling me Welland canal, thereby pre
venting the passage of grain through the
canal from Port Colborae to Montreal.
With th<; canal closed, it is argued, the
Koopera of Buffalo might have more
wonc tliari they would have with the ca
nal open. This line or reasoning, aided
b- rumors or an impending- invasion of
scoopers from Buffalo, resulted in the he
roic measures taken by Sheriff Young?.
It was said in Clifton to-night that the
grain handlers of Buffalo had or;;^nized
lor the raid and that thty wculd reich
the Canadian town to-nignt. Not Know
ing what to expect after such an unusual
thing as the assault on the lock yester
day, tJie. authorities determined to take
no chances. It is believed that the force
at band will be able to repel any party
that may attempt to release the men
from jail. That such an attempt will be
made is not generally credited.
To-day Chief Youngs brought from
Thor.dd to Oifton two men who positive
ly identified the three men in jail as the
mÂ«*n who were seen to run away from
the vkinitv of the lock after the exolO-|
Bion. The m<-n were arrested between
Thorold and Clifton. They were armi'd,
but lnnde no attempt t>> shoot. Two of
the men. Walsh and Nolan, had been
around the Canadian side of the river for
several days. Tin- third man. name un
known, had a room in Clifton, and fre
quently met the other two. who came
across the river. The unknown js be
lieved to be the leader of the gang. Nolan
says he is a mechanic from Phila
delphia. Walsh says he Is a bartender
from Washington. I>. C.
To-day the method of procedure of the
dynamiters was learned in full. The men
maOc sticks of dynamite into two
bundles. These bundles thÂ«Â»y suspended
by rope? at point? about half way to tho
bottom of the lock at the mi<l<_!le. hulf
way from gate to gate. Wire? were found
after the explosion that lÂ«-ad to the belief
thai the dynamite was exploded by <?lec
trioity. The men are believed to have
carried the batteries away with them
and to have disposed of thorn during the
flight. As large quantities of grain pass
over the pteÂ«-l arched bridge of the Grand
Trunk, it is ?ni<l the men would have
blown It up if they had been able to es
cape arrest.
OTTAWA. Ont.. April 22.â A. B. Blair.
Minister of Railways, received a dispatch
to-day from Superintendent Thompson

NEGROES PLOT
EXTERMINATION
OF WHITE MEN
First Assassination Is Fol
lowed by the Suicide of
the Criminal.
Flans of the Blacks Are Discovered
and Two of the Conspirators
Are Summarily
Lynched.
%
Special IMspatch to The Call.
ALLEXTOWX, La.. April 22.â A plot
for the extermination of the whites, a
cowardly assassination as the flr^ act
of the bloody drama, followed by the sui
cide of the terror-stricken murderer, the
discovery of the plot and the prompt
lynching of two of the negro conspirator*
in a record of the most exciting day In
the history of Allentown.
W. T. White, foreman of Allen Bros. &
Wadley's sawmill, was shot and Instant
ly killed by Jeff Rlston, a negro lumber
grader. The murderer escaped to his
cabin, but realizing that capture was In
evitable, sent a bullet through his own
head. Investigation developed the fact
that there was a conspiracy among the
negroes to massacre the whites. Enough
evidence was found to implicate John
Hughly and Ed Ames, two negroes, em
ployes of the mill, as the ringleaders in
the plot. Others were probably concern
ed, but the evidence was not conclusive
and they were not molested. Hughly ana
Ames were led to a spot 200 yards dis
tant from the mill.
White men numbering thirty placed the
prisoners in position against a tree, thirty
revolvers were simultaneously drawn and
at a word all rang out with but one re
pocX. The bullet-riddled corpses were left
where they had fallen.
The Inception of the trouble dates back
about a week. One of the negroes exe
cuted to-day engaged in a quarrel with a
white boy. The dispute was over a piece
ot work. The negto assaulted the boy,
hurling him backward on a moving belt.
I'fompt action of the employes alone
saved the boy from an awful death In the
wheels of the machinery.
Foreman White oraered the negro
whipped. The punishment was adminis
tered and the negro left the mill, but re
turned within several days and resumed
work as if nothing had happened. White
permitted the man to resume his former
position, and did not imagine that re
vengeful negroes were concocting a plot
which woula result in his death.
White nad occasion to reprove Riston
for some slight dereliction, wnich brought
the matter to a climax. At about S:3O he
left his place at the machine and crept
up behind Foreman White, who was at
the desk, urawlng his revolver \v tired
at close range, the bullet entering his
back at a vital point. Rlston fired
again, the second snot taking effect in
the breast^ The unfortunate man fell to
the floor, and the third bullet from the
desperate criminal's revolver missed the
falling body, imbedding itself in the wall
of tne mill.
White expired immediately. The mur
derer escaped in the confusion thru fol
lowed and ran into a near-by cabin and
killed himself. Whites gathered ana
upon consultation decided to rid the com
munity of the bad negroes and the dou
ble lynching alluded to above followed.
It Is not believed there will be any fur
ther trouble.

an IS-year-old boy. In the head, and In his
frenzy gashing his own hand. Aylward
etaggered from the house to the. police
station three blocks away. He stepped up
to tho desk and. placing his blood-stained
hands on it. said:
"I have Just cut a man, and I thought
rd better tell you about it."
He was pent to a cell without resistance.
Officers then arrested the occupants of the
Ehack as witnesses.

SOUGHT TO BE A HERO.
Young Man Burns a House Just to
Save the Family.
ATCHISOX.Kans.. April 22.-In the Dis
trict Court Thomas C. Woerman pleaded
guilty to the charge of burning the costly
residence of J. C. Fox. a prominent citi
zen, and was sentenced to serve eighteen
years in the penitentiary. He admitted
that the Fox family had been very good to
him and that lie set fire to the house in
order to play the part of a hero by res
cuing the family and thereby make his
employer think that his kindness had been
bestowed worthily. After Woerman had
been sentenced he said:
"I pleaded guilty because I hated to face
the members of the Fox family, who had
been co kind to me."

INDICTMENT
AGAINST TAYLOR
TO BE HELD UP
Grand Jury Will Not Re
port It Until After the
Contest Case.
Kentucky's Governor Declares He Is
Not a Fugitive and the Rumor
a Requisition Was Asked
For Is Denied.
Â»
FRANKFORT. Ky.. April 22.â While
the Franklin County Grand Jury has not
adjourned, it is understood that the in
vestigation of the Goebel assassination
has been completed. The indictment
against Governor Taylor will be held up
till after the argument of the Governor
ship contest case, which Is docketed for
hearing before the Supreme Court at
Washington April 30. It is said that no
warrant will be issued or other steps
taken In the case till after that time. The
rumor that Governor Beckham has been
applied to for a requisition is without
foundation.
Former Governor W. O. Bradley, lead
ing counsel for Republican Governor Tay
lor, gave to the Associated Press the fol
lowing interview to-night:
I have had no communication with Governor
Taylor since he went to Washlncton. The
press, I notice, states that he Is there prepar
ing his case for the Supreme Court. I am eat
isfled that this is not true. Governor Taylor
went to Waehmxton on purely personal busl
nesÃ not connected in any way with the trial
of his case.
Nor do I believe the report to be true that
he is in New York attemptlr.e to prevent the
honoring of a requisition for his return to this
State. As to wkhether a requisition could be
lawfully issued by Mr. Beckman cr would be
recognized it is unnecessary for me to express
an opinion, as these ara questions that must
be determined by the auuthority upon whom
eurh a requisition may be made.
Governor Taylor has publicly declared that
he was not and would never be a fugitive
from Justice and that if lndicted'he would re
spect the law and meet his accusers face to
face. Therefore, there remains but one course
open to him and that is to return as soon as
he can. walk boldly and bravely Into court
and meet the Indictment like a man. Any
other course would be rank Injustice not only
to himself, but to those of his friends who have
been accused of so foul a crime. I do not
know whether an Indictment has been found
against Governor Taylor, but if It has I have
no doubt that he wiil promptly surrender him
self Into the hands of the lavr and believe that
any intimation to the contrary docs him an In
justice.
A colonial suggested that cavalry divi
sions always suspend operations for a

A gunner driver in a cart pcred owr a

no news at the Modder.
A man with a drawn face came out of
nowhere and told a story. His wife had
died at home of influenza, was dead and
buried. His people could look after the
children, thank God! but it hurtâ it hurt
cruelly. He spoke and vanished.
Half a mile up the line a private of
Highlanders was cooking potatoes and
semolina together. He was in luck. He
had helped "swipe" a Boer wagon over
turned by cur shell fire, and picked up
the semolina from the dust.
A knot of officers had made themselves
a rude mess house In a roofless hut, with
a blanket for shade. One of them wished
to see a sister of Number Threeâ to tell
her that So-and-So was dead.
A little gathering mov,ed across the dust
to look for the graves of the Highland
Brigade. Even now the nameboards are
split and blistered, and the date carries
us back a thousand years.
And co It went on, hour after hour,

sheets will often bring It, but on occasion
we must help nature.
The worn, chipped and scratched rifles
clattered into the arm racks, the thin
dusty kits followed, and after them the

"Which? Left or right?" said the Sis

said the wagons, and they drew aside to

As for Number Three. No. it would not

might be filled and sent away at any

LIGHT SHED ON THE
PEREZ MYSTERY
Authorities Now Believe That the
Woodchopper Has Returned to
His Home in Philippines.
Special Dissatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL. April 22.â The mystery
of the disappearance of Andrew Perea
now seems to be almost solved, at least
as far as Lagunltas Canyon Is concerned.
Sheriff Taylor is convinced, after a thor
ough investigation, that the remains of
Perez are not. as he at first supposed,
rotting In the Black Hole of Marln. in
fact the probabilities aro that Perez is
alive. In the light of further develop
ments it now looks as though Perez had
Jumped the country and gone to his home
in the Philippines. He was, according
to friends In the wood camp, a quarrel
some, ne'er-do-well and was in the habit
of making Invidious comparisons between
this country and hl3 native land.
His wife, too, tells of her husband's fre
quent spells of homesickness and so It Is
thought by all interested that the man Is
not the victim of foul play, but has gone
to seek pastures new, away from the re
strictions he found so hard to put up with
in the white man's country.
Sheriff Taylor's investigation falls to
reveal any trace of violence. John Enos
foreman of the camp, states that Perez
had no enemies in the woodchopping
community, and about two weeks ago
took his few belongings and passing down
the wagon road left the canyon behind
him. as he said, "forever." Enos thinks
Perez went East, while Mrs. Perez is of
the opinion that her missing husband Is
if alive, in Cuba or the Philippines. In
pplte of the failure of the Investigation to
reveal traces of foul play, a close watch
will be placed on the canyon-dwellers and
a suspicious move on the part of any of
the woodmen may result In arrest.

DISAPPEARS
FROM A HOTEL
IN NEW YORK
Friends of J. W. Moyle,
a Former Californian,
Alarmed.
Left the Hoffman House Two Weeks
Ago and Since Then No Trace
of Him Has Been
Found.
?
Erecial Dispatch to The CalL
NEW YORK. April 22.â Friends of J. W.
Moyle are very anxious to learn what has
become of him. He has been living at the
Hoffman House for the last six months,
but he disappeared two weeks ago yester
day without giving any warning of his
going. Ho left his clothing in his rooms
and took no baggage with him. Since his
departure no word has come from him.
Mr. Moyle is 6S years old and he looks
so much like General Joseph Wheeler that
he was usually known as "the General."
His friends were accustomed to introduce
him to strangers as the gallant Southern
fighter, and the resemblance was so strik
ing that very few ever detected the impo
sition. Mr. Moyle always enjoyed the
joke. He had been at the Hoffman House
for eighteen years before he took up per
manent resilience there. His wife and
daughters live in California, where he be
came interested in mining early in the his
tory of the State. He served in the Cali
fornia Legislature in 1565 with Senator
John P. Jones, now of Nevada, and re
cently he has seen much of Senator Jones,
who also makes his headquarters at the
Hoffman House.
"I have no Idea what has become of
Moyle," said Senator Jones to-day. "I
used to know him very well indeed in the
old days in California. We served to
gether in the State Senate there thirty
tive years ago, but I had not eeen much
of him of late years until we met here at
the Hoffman House last fall. He was al
ways Interested in mining enterprises,
and he told me some time ago that he
had an interest in some Canadian mines,
but where they were I do not know."
Mr. Moyle was a familiar figure In Wall
street and his absence has caused much
comment among brokers there who knew
him.
Colonel Peacock, chief clerk of the ho
tel, was unable to throw any light upon
the mystery to-day. Mr. Moyle's friends
had noticed that on Sundays almost in
variably a younger man of dark complex
lon, whom none of them knew, was in the
habit of Joining him. They were accus
tomed to take luncheon in the cafe and
then go to the Gllsey House. Mr. Moyle
was seen with the stranger two weeks
ago to-day In both hotels.

Ohio Republican Factions to
Clash in Convention on
Tuesday.
Despite the Strife Within the Party,
All Elements Will Give
McKinley Their In
dorsement.
Er*c!al Dispatch to ThÂ» Call.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, April 22.â The Re
publican State Convention will be held
here on Tuesday and Wednesday. The
State officers to be nominated in them
selves are not of great importance, but
interest in the selection of the head of
the ticket this year is heightened by the
campaign made by the anti-Hanna-anti-
Dick faction of the party against the can
didacy of the "administration bosses."
Outside of the State, Republicans ask,
"What kind oft an indorsement will Ohio
give McKinley 7" Within the State they
ask, "How can we best stand by the Pres
ident?"
Two candidates will appear before the
convention for the head position on the
ticket, that of Secretary of Stateâ Lewis
C Laylin of Norwalk and Howard D.
Manington of Columbus. Both assert their
nomination stands for the indorsement of
the President and the national administra
tion. But Mr. Laylin has the open and
avowed indorsement of Senator Hanna
and Chairman Dick.
The contest to capture tjie convention
delegates has been very bitter since last
fall. It was only a few weeks after Gov
ernor Nash's election that Daugherty.
who now opposes Hanna's desires, in an
authorized Interview stated he would
actively support the candidacy of Howard
Manlngton for Secretary of State. He
declared he was in harmony with the ad
ministration of McKinley and would work
for the Indorsement of the administration.
Whether he attempted to forestall Hanna
and Dick by his interview none but Mr.
Daugherty and his closest friends can tell.
Kut Hanna and Dick very quickly gave
the Republicans of the State to under
stand that Daugherty was not dictating
the administration candidates.

by a publication of facts of record in the Chinese Bureau.
The second thoughts of the Collector, however, counseled him to more, than an
evasion of his own challenge. They convinced him of the errors of his past in landing
3000 Chinese as native sons, and of the need of adopting new methods in future. He
has now announced that he will refuse hereafter to decide cases of Chinese claiming ad
mission as natives of the United States, thus compelling them to have recourse to the
courts. He is quoted as saying in a recent interview that he has come to the conclusion
he has no jurisdiction in such matters, and that he can find no statute giving him au
thority to consider these cases; and he is reported to have added: "The attorneys for
the Chinese have threatened to mandamus me, but they will have to take what steps they
please, for I am determined to take the course I have outlined."
This is one of the instances where "better late than never" is a good rule. There
is some satisfaction in learning that if the publication in The Call of the Chinese Bureau
statistics convinced Collector Jackson that the records must be Kept secret, it has also
convinced him that claims of Chinese to be natives must be remanded to the courts. The
Chinese and their attorneys will of course hasten to devise some other means of effect
ing admission. to the United States, for the trade of importing coolies is too valuable to
be surrendered without a fight. In the meantime, however, much has been gained by
breaking up the practice in its present form, and while public vigilance must not be re
laxed, The Call has the satisfaction of knowing it has not. only exposed an evil of por
tentous magnitude but has brought about the application of an immediate remedy. It
is a victory for the people, the importance of which will be appreciated by all who have any
understanding of the menace which Chinese immigration holds for American labor, law,
morality and civilization.
THIS MAN'S FACE GIVES
ENGLAND A SEVERE PAIN
BY publishing the records of the Chinese Bureau in this city The Call exposed the
extent to which Chinese immigration has been going on for the last three years,
and revealed the portentous fact that a considerable number of the immigrants
have been admitted not only to the country but to citizenship as natives of the United
States. The publication was made not for the purpose of discrediting an y official, but
. Â¦ -â¢' . .'â¢"Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦.
solely for the general good and to the end that all officials in authority should be aroused
to the exercise of greater vigilance in the enforcement of the exclusion act. It is there
fore gratifying to be, able to state that the exposure has had an immediate wholesome
effect, and that for a time at least San Francisco will not be so wide open a door to
Mongolian coolies who claim citizenship in our country.
When the records of the Chinese Bureau were published in The Call and their sig
nificance made clear, Collector Jackson- rashly undertook to defend the manner in which
According to a report of the quartermaster general
th<* cost of the army transport service since the out
break of the war with Spain has been $25.&oo.ooo for
vessels alone. The country will not grumble at the
bill, for the expenditure was necessary, but it is worth
while asking why a nation that expends that amount

t'en of it for the purpose of upbuilding a merchaift
marine in time of peace.
NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
The French navy budget, as finally
passed, amounts to $62,000,000. which is
$1,200,000 more than the appropriation for
the year Just ended.
Krupp is steadily adding to his vast
establishment at Essen to meet the de
mands for war material In armor, puns
and projectiles. The latest improvement
consists in a lot of new buildings covering
four and a half acres at a cost of $575,000.
The labor payroll at Chatham dockyard
during one week last month was $65,000 for
men employed In the building and repair
ing of ships. This sum exceeds by at lea3t
50 per cent the total amount paid at all
the navy-yards in the United States for
like purposes in one week.
The horsepower required for various
maximum speeds of torpedo-boat destroy
ers of about 320 tons displacement has
been figured out to be as follows for each
ton displacement: 26 knots, 12% horse
power; 27 knots, 15Vi; 30 knots, 20; 32 knots.
24%, and for 35 knots It required 31' i
horsepower.
The price of armor In foreign navies is
considerably less than Is demanded by the
two plants In this country. For plain ar
mor England pays W3 per ton, while our
navy has been charged $430 to $600 and
France paid $445 to $475. For Harveyized
armor the cost Is $500 to $525 in England.

STANDING OF FREE SILVER
IUDGE TARSNEY of Oklahoma is not a jurist
Â£Â¦> J of national repute, nor a statesman of fame, nor
a political leader of renown. Perhaps the reason
why he has attained to none of those eminences is
that he is a man of singular candor and reveals the
v/orkings of his mind in such a way that his very
guile appears like that excessive frankness which h
known as rankness; and thus his neighbors look upon
him not so much as a candid friend as a pudding
head.
The Judge has recently given his advice on the po
litical situation to the Democrats and the Populists
of his neighborhood, and in the course of it he said.-
"Bryan represents the silver question, but every
body knows that is a settled question,; and nobody
will get scared over it. If I had the writing of the
platform, opposed as I am to the silver craze, I be
lieve that I would put that 16 to 1 business in just to
catch the wild-eyed fellows who cannot understand
anything else, and know but little about that."
There is candor. Free silver is dead and the Judge
is opposed to reviving it, for he deems it nothing
more than a craze at best, but he would nevertheless
declare for it in a national platform. According to
his view the Bryanites are spreading taffy for flies
and fools in this campaign, and in his judgment iny
thing that tends to catch them is good.*
There arc not many politicians who would have the
frankness to speak out as the Oklahoma dignitary
has done, but a good many of them who will be loud
in disclaiming his "leadership will sneakingly follow
his advice. They will call him a fool and then act
upon his plan. That is Bryanism. That is standing
by free silver.
las* week, and the failures were 161 against 187 last
year. The latter showing is a good one, as it points
out that the price liquidation now going on is healthy
and does not imply hard times. On the contrary, the
abundance of money in the country, albeit in com
paratively few hands, is a safeguard against any seri
ous reverse. So there is nothing to fear.
THAT OLD. FAMILIAR LAW.
THE check in manufactured goods mentioned
frequently of late, and which has been the fea
ture of the business situation for some little
time, is becoming more apparent. Its beginning was
remarked only by dose financial and mercantile ob
servers, and nine-tenths of the business men of the
United States have been blissfully unconscious, un
til the past fortnight, that such a change was creep
ing over national trade. The majority of them do
not know it now. But it is here.
This change has been freely outlined in this col
umn for two months, but it will bear repetition. It
is that prices for almost everything manufactured
are too high, and are coming down. This is all there
is to it. We had a boom last year, and like all booms
it has come to an end. Production has passed the
demand, and an involuntary halt has taken place.
From now on a period must elapse until we can use
up the vast quantity of manufactured goods, and
when they are used up we will go ahead again.
This is the situation in a nutshell. In the meantime
prices must shade off more or less to accommodate
themselves to the capacity of the public purse, and
that is what is going on to-day.
A glance at the condition of the leading manufac
tured staples will show this condition clearly. The
production of iron, so vast in 1899, has become so
unwieldy that the price of plates and bars has de
clined $5 per ton, the American Steel and Wire Com
pany has closed its mills, and buyers are holding off,
expecting still lower prices. Boots and shoes are
dull, and all the factories are not working; some are
running on half time and others have not a month's
orders ahead. The high prices have scared off buy
ers, and as the price of leather, in the face of this
condition, is still obstinately held up, there is a block
to business in consequence. If leather is allowed to
decline to the margin-of-profit point boots and shoes
will probably move again. Wool is in the same boat.
Producers ask so much for their wool that the manu
facturers cannot operate at prevailing prices without
advancing final quotations, which the public refuses
to pay, so wool is in the hole along with iron and
boots and 'shoes. Cotton goods; too, are selling at
concessions, for few expect present prices to last.
And thus it goes, all along the line, and every few
days some other branch of industry joins the con
tinually growing procession.
The matter will adjust itself, and probably without
difficulty or serious inconvenience. There is a law
of supply and demand, which sooner or later asserts
itself in spite of the efforts of trusts and combinations
to evade or crush it. It is asserting itself now. We
bought goods so furiously in 1899 that we only
stopped when we had overstocked ourselves, and now
we do not want any more for some little time. Hap
pily the process of adjustment is slow. Money is
plentiful and there is little danger of any grave hap
pening. But thousands of goods which were sharply
advanced in 1899 will have to come down to the level
of the public pocket, and no power on earth can ar
rest the descent to this level. When the adjustment
is finally completed we will start in and do it all over
again, for that is the way of man.
Commercial authorities are busy just now in ex
plaining away this subsidence in prices, precisely 23
the defeated party explains away its defeat after elec
tion. Most of them lay it to the weather. Any oM
excuse wUI do, and the weather is something that
never denies what you say. So it has been the pre
ferred scapegoat ever since creation.

exchange would be safe was to exclude
everything except producing companies.
Tho vote to postpone action for six
months was practically unanimous."
The Santa Barbara Press has an ac
count of an agreement to sell 1000 acres or
the Dos Puehicp ranch, in Santa Barbara
County, for $80,000 to an oil company. The
present owner is Stephen Rutherford. The
company will soon begin to prospect for
oil.
Ground hns been broken for a new oil
refiner-/ on thr> line nf the Terminal rail
way, between Long Beach and San Pedro.
The concern will he operated ns the Sun
set Oil Refining Company. The plant will
be in operation in thirty days and wi'l
have a capacity nf 500 barrels* of crude oil
per day. Philadelphia capital is in the
enterprise. The capital stock is 1100.000.
As an indication of the Increased con
sumption of California crude oil. it may
bo noted that the smelter at Redding, in
the northern part of thÂ« State, is building
a stfPl tank to hold 125.0C0 gallons, ana
that oil will be used for fuel in the future
Instead of coal. The smelter has been
using a carload of coal every twenty-four
hours but finds oil more economical.

QUEST FOR OIL
CONTINUING IN
MANY SECTIONS
One Company Extending Its
Operaiions Far Inio
the Ocean.
Seats in the Los Angeles OH Exchange
have risen to a premium. The limit of
membership has been placed at fifty and
the price at E>o. There was much fur
prise last \>i>ek when a broker announced
that he would give $~5 for a seat. A local
observer says that there was "a hush for
a moment and then the excitement broke
loose. The bid was increased by $5 at a
lime until $100 was offered for a seat, but
there were none for sale. The final bid
was received with applause by the brok
ers and spectators." The same day that
this enthusiasm was manifested the ex
change broke its records for sales. The
shares sold numbered C7OO and the price
paid was $4540.
The Duquesne Oil Company, operating
at Summerland. has let a contract for a
new wharf, which will accommodate eight
more derricks. This will give the com
pany thirty wells. The operations of
the company, while extending out into the
ocean, are not considered troublesome.
The wells are shallow and drilling is not
difficult. The company has one-half mile
of water front and room to sink 200 wells.
While it Is an incorporation, the stock is
reported to be held exclusively by Thomas
\\ ood of Pennsylvania and R. 11. Her
ron of Los Angeles.
Messrs. K. eniCKerlng. E. T. Howe and
Louis Brown, officers of one of the larg
est oil concerns in the country, have been
inspecting the fields in the south and say
that they will pay the same attention to
them in future that has been given to
the Eastern fields.
A. H. Rlcketts of the California Miners'
Association expresses in the Mining and
Scientific Press the following ideas con
cerning the proper conditions for filing
upon oil lands:
"In the opinion of the writer, lands
claimed a? petroleum oil lands, and which
present such indications of the existence
of that or other mineral oils that the
claimant is willing to spend his time and
money in exploring It in the expectation
of finding such fluid minerals In paying
quantity, supported by expert testimony,
showing that the land contains such In
dications as to make it it likely that pe
troleum or other mineral oils will be
found therein in paying quantities, or the
fact that neighboring territory is pro
ducing oil and that the geological condi
tions warrant the conclusion that the oil
stratum' underlies the ground sought to
be appropriated by the mineral claimant
should be sufficient basis for a valid pe
troleum placer location or to withdraw
such lands from agricultural entry at
least a reasoiable length of time, dur
ing which exploratory work should be
prosecuted with reasonable diligence or
the claim be forfeited. But that is not the
law and nothing short of Congressional
legislation will make such conditions pos
sible."
"While Los Angeles 19 In the" throes of
protest against the location of oil wells In
certain districts in that city San Diego
comes forward with a similar complaint.
An effort will be made to locate oil wells
Inside of the city limits on land recently
leased from the San Diego Land and
Town Company back of False Bay and
north of the valley of the San Diego
River. The lease of several hundred
acres of pueblo lands was made by one
company.
'.It is estimated that by - May 15 there
will be about eighty wells In the Kern
River oil fields In a condition to pump oil.
"With possibly one exception the 'railroad
has secured rights of way into the dis
trict. The Southern Pacific Company has
promised to begin the construction of a
track as soon as. the complete right of
way is cleared up.
The Los Angeles Times of April 13 says:
"The Oil Exchange delivered a knockout
blow to the proposition of dealing in wild
cat stocks by postponing action on the
matter for six months. There was a desire
on the part -of, some of the members to

WRANGLING OF THE TURF CROOKS
DISCLOSURES made by the wrangling turf
men concerning the manner in which racing
has been carried on for the fleecing of the
public afford to the people of San Francisco further
lessons upon that subject. After the fearful list of
frauds, embezzlements and crimes committed by the
victims of the track to obtain money to play the races
come these revelations that the dupes never had a
chance to win. Not only were the odds against the
outside bettors under all circumstances, but the races
themselves were fixtd and the result made a sure
thing for the gamblers.
It is not worth while for the public to take sides in
this quarrel among the sure thing men. It can wait
patiently to see what the turf authorities -.vill do in the
way of punishing or of whitewashing In the mean
time the intelligence of the people will perceive that
the logic of the charges and the countercharges leads
to the conclusion that there has been either whole
sale crookedness or wholesale lying among the mem
bers of the racing ring; nor is it likely much wrong
will be done to either side if the public concludes
there has been both lying and crookedness.
To the patrons of the ring, the customers of the
track gamblers, these disclosures must bring about
as bitter medicine as men have ever to take. They
have squandered their earnings, deprived their fami
lies cf the comforts of life, have borrowed money,
and in many cases have been tempted to steal it, in
order to obtain the means of betting on the races;
and now they learn that they were cheated from the
start, that they have been played for suckers of the
rawest kind, and that for their coin they have received
not even a gold brick.
When one recalls the evil that has resulted from
the track gambling carried on at Tanforan and for a
time at the Ingleside track under the management of
the Eastern sports, there is something frightful in the
disclosures that are now being made. Men have been
led on from wasting their incomes to profligacy, to
petty frauds, to gross crimes, to exposure, to ruin,
to fiight, to prison or to suicide; and all for nothing,
fcr not even a chance to win, for not so much as 2
shadow of a chance. The track gamblers, arranging
the conditions of the races to suit themselves, con
trolling the jockeys and having everything in their
own hands, have not given their dupes even the slight
chance that they seemed to have on the face of the
cards. There has been no "sport" in the game at any
time.
Finally, it i? to be borne in mind that we are but
at the beginning of the revelations of crookedness.
If the wrangling factions do not become suddenly
frightened at the disclosures of their own tricks, and
in a common fear abandon their controversy, we shall
probably learn of many more frauds on the tracks.
It is not likely that the acts now charged against cer
tain jockeys and owners are all that have been com
mitted. Even should the specific charges of fraud
prove to be lies, there would still remain fastened
upon the track gamblers the crookedness that im
pelled the lying.
The education of San Francisco upon the evil of
trick gambling ought now to be complete. The rec
ords of the criminal courts and the Morgue show the
effects af the gambling, and the disclosures of fraud
among the jockeys and their managers show the
means by which those effects are wrought. What
more can be required to confirm the people and the
municipal authorities in a firm resolve to put an end
to this nefarious trade which injures legitimate racing
and horse breeding by degrading "the sport of kings"
to a common swindle and a public curse?

FELL IN LOVE
WITH DEERING,
THE BURGLAR
An Attractive Woman Madly
Infatuated With the
Crook.
Shs Was to Have Become His Wife
in Los Angeles, but Was Pre
vented by His
Arrest.
Â«
Burglar Deerinc has a 3\veetheart v.-ho
firmly believes him innocent of the many
crimes charged against him. She Is a
blonde of medium height and rather at
tractive. Who she is the sleuths of the
"upper office" have been unable to ascer
tain. She refuse? to reveal her identity,
but makes no attempt to conceal her love
for the burglar. Since his arrest she has
been his only visitor, vainly attempting to
cheer him up and make his enforced stay
in the prison as comfortable as the cir
cumstances permit. Yesterday she con
fided to the detectives' who arrested Deer
ing that she met him in Los Angeles about
two months ago and fell desperately In
love with him.
After a brief courtship they became en
gaged, the woman thinking that Deerln,?
was what he represented himself to beâ a
merchant of New York City. On the eve
of their wedding Decrlng was arrested on
suspicion of having entered a number of
private residences in Los Angeles and
stealing several thousand dollars' worth of
jewelry- She- was present when he was"
being searched by the detectives, and
vigorously denounced his arrest as an out
rage. After being held In Jail for over two
weeks Deering was given his freedom,
the detectives were unable to gather suf
ficient evidence against him. Morally cer
tain of his guilt, the police gave him to
understand that his presence in the south
ern city was not needed. Taking the hint
Deering packed his grip and came to San
Francisco.
a few aays later his sweetheart followed
and was met by the housebreaker. Deer
ing Informed her that it was necessary
for him to return to New York, and that
he wanted her to accompany him as his
wife. He severely criticized the Los
Angeles detectives for having arrested
him, and threatened tr> bring sii4t against
them for heavy damages.
While the love-smltTfn woman was pre
paring her trousseau Deering was adding
to his spoils by plundering various lodg
ing-houses. After committing a series of
unusually bold burerlarles Deerlns was
finally captured by Detectives Wren and
Dinar.. . In his room was found a large

"The Tariff of Abominations."
The last Congress of Adams' term wai
composed in both houses of a strong 1 ma
jority of Jackson's friends, who spent
their energies mainly in preparing for thi
advent of their hero. Such a Congress
had never met before. Its last sessior
was a scurrilous partisan wrangle, actlo:
upon either side being taken with a view
to Its effect upon the approaching elec
tion. A new tariff bill, well called "tht
tariff of abominations."' passed In thÂ© la*
hours of the session, was of such a char*
acter. It was protective solely, no addi
tional revenue being then needed, and IU
purpose was to secure votes fnr Jacksor.
In the States favoring protection. By a
deep-laid scheme attributed to the will
Van Buren. the duties were laid In suet
a way as to offend the New England sup
porters of Adams, while pleasing thÂ© pro
ducers of raw materials In the Middle an<
Western States. Jackson men from at
quartets wera to support the bill, but 01
the final vote the Southern members wen
to turn round, and, voting with thÂ© N>k
England men. defeat the measure, but tht
odium of the defeat was to be cast upo:
New England. To the surprise of thi
plotters, the bill, with tt3 absurd and ob
noxious features almost unchanged, be
came a law. The South was furious. For
years it had seen Itself left far behind tht
North in the growth of population anc
wealth. It saw New England becomlni
rich and powerful under protected manu
factures, the Central and Western Statei
developing rapidly under protected ra-w
materials. Its own prosperity appeare.}
to depend upon the untrammeled exporta.
tion to Europe of Its cotton, tice and to
bacco, with the free Importation thenre o:
the manufactured goods required. Tha
slavery waa the real clog to Southers
progress Southern men wem not yet abli
to see. and a bitter feeling grew uj
against the national protective policy fa
vored in the North.
In the Jaok.Â«nn party wÂ»rÂ© men of aE
shades of opinion as to thÂ© tariff. whllÂ«
the Adams and Clay forces were practi
cally united In support of a protectivt
policy. It seems to have been the plaxv o:
the latter to make profction the leading
question in the campaign of IS2S. but thÂ«
Jackson managers chose to divert publii
attention from matters o? national lmpor
to the personal chargf of a corrupt po
litical "deal" between Adams and Clay, li
the previous election.
The tariff of IS3. pleasing nobody as a
whole, was modified and some of the ob
jectionable provisions nrraoved by the leg
islation of IS3> and ISS2, while In ISS3 tht

concession to the South, providing for a

Flowery Article Written by

News Here.
Turf Scandal Will Come Up Before
the Stewards To-Night.
Piggott Asserts His
Innocence.
Well! here's a warm one. and it comes
all the way from Greater New York, pub
lished in a metropolitan journal with a
wide circulation in the tenderloinâ and
sirloinâ districts. The article is headed.
"Ed Corrlgan a Square Man," and In the
full bloom of his exuberance the writer
thus gushingly eulogizes the Hawthorne
magnate:
"Edward Corrlgan intends to race In
England this year and proposes to ship
twenty racers over there. Corrigan's
mild and gentle manners will give the
English racing public a fair Idea of the
amiable, pttace-lovlng Western turfman."
Now, this Is a new brand of salve never
before used out this way and It Is very
evident the. author of this charming con
ceit has not teen or conversed with Cor
rlgan in a lone, long time. Perhaps when
he did meet the big horseman he was
only a small boy wearing abbreviated
trousers and was given a stick of candy
and a hunk of gingerbread to be a good
little man. Grown people know these fa
vors early bestowea linger long in the
youthful mind.
Much of this sort of tommyrot has ap
peared In the press of late and it places
the Chicago horseman In a pitiful light,
supplicating himself at the feet of news
paper writers whom he has always de
spised, beseeching them to tell the Eng
lish people what a kind and mild-manner
ed man he is. Unhappily, war-racked
England! Try and receive him. Your
gain is not our loss. Time cannot efface
the memory of Corrigan's racing methods
in and around Chicago, resulting in the
ultimate destruction of the sport, with
Garfleld Park's carnival of blood the
crowning blot on its history. Neither
can the page on ..which Is Inscribed the
history of his hundred and one- disgrace
ful brawls on nearly even* course in this
country, from rights with negro "swipes"
to blasphemous arguments with racing
judges, be torn from the book. Closed

curses the day Corrlgan touched the soil
of the Golden West.
The question Is now raised. Will Cor
rigan be permitted to race his horses in
England? He was refused a license by
the Jockey Club of New York, his en
tries were rejected at Harlem track. Chi
cago, and also by the management of the
Oakland track. It looks a parallel case
with that of a boy named McDonald, sus
pended about two years ago by Captain
James Rees at Hawthorne track, Chi
cago. Last summer the directors of the
Chicago Racing Association lifted the
ruling against the wishes of Rees. The
license committee of the Turf Congress
then refused to grant McDonald a license
and he Is unable to ride In this country.
But if the racing officials across the pond
stand ready to welcome this class it looks
a pood country for them to emigrate to.
The turf scandal is teetering in the bal
ance, awaiting some new develooments at
to-night's resumption of the thing by the
Tanforan Park stewards. It Is said Ed
Corrlgan makes no direct charges against
lockey Henry, only complaining that the
bcv. did not ride more closely to orders.
ioo Piggott says he has been wronged,
as he can show if given a fair and Im
partial chance to explain matters. Joe as
serts he does not like money well enough
to. pull horse?, claiming he would have
started in years ago If such had been the
case.
The Sly case still hangs fire. "Red,"
one of Dan Hanlon's stable hands, makes
a vigorous denial against the statement
made that he ever stuffed or In any way
meddled with the mare. To-night's ses
sion promises bisr things, but may fizzle
out urider investigation.

V. PARTIES DURING THE JACK
SON PERIOD.
BY JESSE MACY. LL. D
From the election of 1?24 may be dated
the rise of what is often called "Jack
sonlan Democracy." which Is the personal
rule of the most popular man. The old
Republican or Democratic-Republican
party was rent into a number of factions,
each gathered round the person of an as
pirant to the Presidency. Jackson had the
largest following, and the characteristic
tendency in democratic nations for the
people to divide Into two fairly equal po
litical bodies now began to assert itself.
In the final choosing of a President it
was natural -for the weaker factions to
combine against the strongest. Clay, be
ing out of the race, held theÂ» decision in
his own hands, since his electoral votes
given to one or another of the remaining
candidates would determine the result.
Crawford, feeble and palsied, seemed an
Impossible choice. There was strong per
sonal enmity between Jackson and Clay,
while the Calhoun and Jackson forces
were drawing together. It was apparently
lnevitable that Clay's votes should be
given to Adams. The day following Ad
ams' election he announced his choice of
Clay for Secretary of State, and charges
of a corrupt political "bargain" have ever
since clung to the names of those two
high-minded, upright and patriotic men.
There was never any trustworthy proof of
the assumed fact, but the cloud shadowed
all Clay's after. career and was one of the
influences contributing to the turbulence
of Adams' term of offlce.
Policy of John Quincy Adams.
Out of the personal rivalries of this pe
riod political parties based to a consider
able extent upon questions of govern
mental policy are now seen to emerge.
President Adams set forth definite ?nd pos
itive principles upon which he proposed
to shape his administrative career. Giving
a liberal construction to the terms of the
constitution, he warmly favored internal
Improvements by Federal aid and advo
cated national education. Trouble In Geor
gia respecting the final settlement of
.treaties with the Creek Indians, which in
volved disputes as to certain lands. led to
the firm declaration by the executive of
his intention to maintain Federal rights
against the arrogant assertion of the
power of the State to override United
States authority. In the resulting Con
i gressional debate upon this matter Web
: yter's powerful voice was heard in sup
port of the administration, while South
ern members freely raised the cry of Fed
eral infringement upon the constitutional
rights of the States and interference with
domestic concerns, coupled with threats
of withdrawal fn.m tfc<- Union. But the
' opponents of the President in Congress
withheld their support, and the weakness
of the administration was shown by
Georgia's successful defiance.
When tariff questions came to the front
It appeared that North and South were
divided upon the subject of protection
also. Underlying the various differences
as they rose may be seen the old consti
tutional quarrel between strict a.nd broad
Interpretation of the constitution State
i sovereignty and the supremacy of the
! National Government. The administration
I of Adams was a clean, honorable, digni
fied one. He persistently refused to use
the public patronage for his personal or
! party advantage. It was not a popular
or a successful administration. Adams
was a minority President. Jackson was
' the people's choice. Scarcely had the Â«
! ecutlve taken the official oath In ISCS when
i Jackson was announced as a candidate lor
j the election of 1523.
Andrew Jackson.
The old Democratic-Republican party
woke to new life under Jackson s leader
i ship. His brilliant military success had
! made him the popular Idol. He repre
i sented the eager, aspiring, indomitable
i spirit of the new great West and the
! limitations of his training from ptn-erty
i and frontier conditions only endeared
I him the more to the hearts of the peo
i pie who understood the crude, uncultured
i but self-reliant manhood which "makes
> circumstances" and disregards conditions.
! The new era in American politics inaugu
1 rated by Jackson's triumphant election in
1 1S2S tasted to the civil war. More than
any President who preceded him. he was
elected by the people. The newer States
; had entered ih<Â» Union with manhood
! suffrage practically unrestricted and
! property qualifications in the older
' States were becoming less stringent.
! Jackson was the choice of the new elec
torate: he stood for the direct power of
the people. Dominion was passing from
I the hands of Congress to those of the
I Executive, who had become the erabodl
| ment of the new Ideal, "popular sover
elgntv." The overbearing assumption by
i the Congressional caucus of the right to
' dictate to the people for whom they
I mi?ht vote as candidate for the Presi
! dency faded away as Jackson's star
i arose and the convention system, appeal
i ing directly to the voters and conforming
i to the rising popular ideals In govern
i ment. became established In national poll-
Party Evolution.
The new system was part and parcel
with the rise of a new order of political
parties. It gave to their organization
that completeness and effectiveness which
Insured their perpetuity and created" In
i American political life a force destined to
| work great results for weal and for woe
! in the unquiet times of the darkening fu
| ture. "Here is a revolution." wrote
I John Quincy Adams of this extension of
' party organization. And he foresaw, as
did Calhoun also, tragedy and disaster
from the violence of the popular passions
to be engendered and fostered by the new
methods. But this development of party
machinery was not a revolution, it was
a natural evolution. The seeds of the
mighty growth were planted deep In the
soil of EnsSish history and were warmed
to life by the sunshine of new-world
democracy.
The politics of an Ideally free people
must permeate Its whole life and a peo
ple will necessarily make for Itself organs
for expressing Its will after the manner
rendered Inevitable by its history and
character.
Party Names.
Out of the Democratic-Republican party
during J. Q. Adams' term of ofilce came
forth two opposing parties, neither ready
to yield the right to the time-honored
name. The Adams and Clay forces as
serted themselves to be the genuine Repub
licans of the true Jeffersonlan type. and.
being the administrative party, designat
ed Jackson's adherents as the "opposi
tion." But about IS3O the word "na
tional" began to be placed before the
party names and for several yeare "Na
tional Republicans" was the accepted
title of the followers of Clay. - The Jack
son party adhered to the hyphenated
name (which is to thl3 day the official
name of the present Democratic party),
but It was soon shortened and the part*
has ever since been called the Democratic
party.
Within the ranks of the national Re
publicans gathered as years passed the
various elements opposed to Jacksonlan
politicsâ the anti-Mason, who had failed
in effective party organization in 1332. the
nulllfiers of South Carolina and the Geor
gia supporters of States' rights, disap
pointed and angered by the President's
determined maintenance of the Federal su
premacy and those who held the old Fed
eralist views. The amalgamation of these
incongruous elements was facilitated In
1534 by the adoption of the new name.
Whig, for the conglomerate party, a name
which was supposed to embody the Idea
of resistance to executive tyranny In the
person of Andrew Jackson as It had stood
for resistance to the crown In the days
of the revolution. From that time for
nearly twenty years Whigs and Demo
crats fought the politcal battles of the
Union, and other effective parties there
were none.
The Spoils System Established.
Jackson readily adopted the "New York
plan" of using the public patronage and
his official power of removal for "reward
ing his friends and punishing his ene
mies." Van Buren of New York was his
confidential manager and the most skillful
political manipulator of his time. They
heartily agreed In appropriating as 'Vic
tors'* the "spolla" which they had won.
In Jackson's first message rotation In
office was declared "a leading principle In

The steamer Lakme. which arrived

Worrying Over the Annie Thomas.
The Annie Thomas has now been given
up by the underwriters and a few more
days Â¦will probably see her "posted at
Lloyds as missing." She is now out 270
days from Cardiff, for Acapulco. an-i the
last time she was seen was off the Horn,
when she was making heavy weather in a
howling gale.
Captain Meredith was particularly well
known In San Francisco. He was last here
In the Dominion, but left that vessel to
got married. On her next voyage under a
new master the Dominion started from
Honolulu for Pvget Sound and has never
been heard from since. Shortly after the
Dominion was posted as missing Captain
Meredith took command of the Annie
Thomas and now that vessel has been
given up as lost by the underwriters.
Crowds on. the Front.
The water front was crowded with peo
ple yesterday. In the morning there was a
rush to cross the bay to picnic grounds
and in the afternoon crowds hurried to get
al>oard the battleships lowa and French
cruiser Protet. The Dolphin Boating and
Swimming Club took a big crowd to Fair
fax, while the Old Friends went to San
Rafael. Thousands went to Shell Mound
and Schuetzen Park. Take it all to
gether the ferry-boats had the heaviest
day of the season.
Harbor Commissioners Harney and Her
old paid the front a visit. The State Is
having an immense amount of work done
on the wharves and the two Commis
sioners cannot let a day pass without see
ing how affairs are progressing. The ac
commodations for the Sausallto ferry are
now nearing completion, the new post
office is halfway constructed and the new
cylinder pier wharf at Howard 3 will be
finished long before the contract time ex
pires.
The North End Improvement Club
owes Commissioner Herold a debt of grat
itude, as it is due to him In a trreat meas
ure that the erection of the wharves be
tween Union and Lombard, the construc
tion of new ferry slips on the north side
of Ixjmbard-street wharf and the building
of the wharves and breakwater for the
fishermen at the foot of Taylor street will
move aJong simultaneously. When these
Improvements are completed the north
end will have all it can desire and San
Francisco will have shipping facilities
equal to its wants.
"Water Front Notes.
George A. Knight was out In his launch
Athlete yesterday, but as the wind died
down In the morning and there was no
chance for a blow an excursion outside
was abandoned. Mr. Knight is never
happy unless it is blowing half a gale
and the Athlete is under water most of
the time. Then he will stay out for
hours, but thirty minutes in a clam Is all
he can stand.
Mrs. H. E. Morrison, wife of Pr. Morri
son, on" of thÂ«Â» snrpeons at the Harbor
Hospital, left for Los Angeles yesterday
on a visit to friends and relative?. She
expects to be gone six weeks.

were all the batters worked off on them,
and were it not for the glaring errors of
Brockhoff. who played at the third sta
tion, the tale would have had a different
denouement.
In the third inning Whelan scored and
In the fifth Moore, who went midway on
his course by a double, crossed the rub
ber. The sixth meant a run for the
Wasps, as did the eighth, and the score
was tied. It was chanced, however, in
the next Inning, when Stockton went to
the bat. The score:

In new raiment of euramery hues, was paÂ«sin? the "g!ad hazi** ta htm local

and early. Judge Fletcher Cutler of Del Norte antj Judge McXoble cf H:oci^a

boarded the boat there were a few cheers and the cry was "On to Orovtlle"'
nROVTLLE, April 2.-The Native
Sons have arrived and Oroville Is
as lively a town as oae could wish
I J to see. Everybody is settled com-
V â ' fortably somewhere and ample
room is ready for any more that may
come on this evening's train, and by to
morrow; on time and all ready, the Grand
Lodge will open its session.
The afternoon train from San Francisco
brought up a good two-thirds of the dele
gate* and their friends. There were close
to three hundred in the party. The re
ception committee, under the leadership of
its chairman, A. M. Smith, and several
members of the accommodation commit
tee, with its chairman, G. W. Braden,
went down the road on the 4 o'clock train
this morning and- met the visitors at
Woodland. While the reception committee
distributed lunches, the accommodation
committee assigned rooms, and when the
visitors left the train there were few who
had not been provided for.
The visitors were met at the train by the
local parlor. Argonaut No. S. wtth the
Oroville band. They were taken at once
to the headquarters, where volunteers
came forward to take them to their quar
ters. Most of the grand officers were
among the early ones, and they went
down to lock at the rTall and suggest the
best arrangements for the session. The
hall was built specially for this session,
or rather its building was the outgrowth
of the session, for the Natives are going
to use it frequently hereafter. It is a
brick building, the hall and its ante-rooms
occupying the entire second floor.
i The politics of the. session has not so far
made Itself prominent amone the dele-
I gates, nor will it until all have arrived
: and the Grand Parlor has organized. The
j lights already noted have come up with
! the delegates, but there is talk of a new
' one against Henry Martin. He has been
' grand treasurer so long it always looked
as if he owned the oftlce, but now there is
talk of Kahn of San Francisco running
; agair.st him. Cutler of Humboldt and Mc
: Noble of Stockton have each their warm
' adherents in their run for grand orator.
'. and there is also a small bcomiet for
: ll^serve of Los Angeles for the same
; place. It was reported that perhaps either
, Cutler or McKoble might withdraw, but
with a third man In the race it is beiived
: n<^ith*-r will do so. The light for grand
â¢ trustees has brought forward several in
cipient booms that will develop later on.
; Seven grand trustees will be elected and
{ there are perhaps fourteen candidates, all
â¢ willing. This evening tbe re was a band
Â¦ concert in Courthouse square. It was an
; Idea! night for such an affair and every
Â¦ body was out. There was v slight rain
j early this morning, and every one was
; worrying until the sun rose bright and
; clear. To-day was warm and pleasant.
I No sign of dark cloud? or rain and from
j the oldest inhabitant down every one is

NARCISSUS ADDS
TO WINNINGS OF
CURTIS' KENNELS
Defeats Rock Island King
for the Stake at Union
Park.
Curtis & Son's fawn and white grey
hound Narcissus justified the confidence
of mar.y bettors yesterday at Union
Coursing Park and added to the long list
cf winnings of the coursing firm from
San Jose. Th*Â» wise division played him
off the board in the long odds book, ap
parently figuring him the fastest dog in
the stake barring Luxor, his kennel mate,
whom be would not be called upon to
meet under the laws of coursing. Narcis
sus defeated Hurricane by a score of 3 to
2. Chicago Boy 4âo. Warship hâZ. Mose
7â3. He then ran a bye course with Cash
and qualified for the deciding course with
Rock Island King. He showed too much
class for the latter, which he defeated
handily by a score of 3 to 2.
The sensational course of the day was
between Warsaip and Narcissus", the
former being installed a 2Vj to V? favorite.
Narcissus led from the slips, but Warship
drew level before they had traveled far.
Narcissus scored the lirst turn by a nar
row margin, placing Warship, who se
cured two wrenebf-s and a ""trip." Narcis
kus then killed and won by a score of 5
tot
As a token that hares are running
Â¦trooser than they have been for pome
months, two cogs were withdrawn after
what are considered long courses at this
time of the year. Luxor injured his foot
in a minute coursp. and ratj^r than sus
tain permanent injury he wr.s withdrawn.
Wanda was the second to retire. She ran
one minute and thirty-nine seconds with
Wait a Little and was retired in the suc
ceeding round.
R. K. Malcom's English dog Fine Fire
was given another trial, {his time in a
bye course with For Glory. He scored
the first turn by a slight favor of the hare
and worked It cleverly until he had scored
seven points to For Glory's two. He then
drove the hare to her for the kill, giving
her four points in all. He gives promise
of becoming one of the great dogs of the
coast.
Overture showed lameness, presumably
from rheumatism, and was withdrawn.
Bad Boy ran two undecided courses
with Risky Attempt in the first round be
fore he finally won. In the next round he
met and defeated Crawford Lad. which
vcz.? installed a strong favorite at odds
of SS 1 * to i. Bad Bey went out in the next
round before Herschel's Pride. The latter
in turn was retired by Brutus after an un
decided course. This was one of the most
stubbornly contested courses of the day.

San Francisco 4, Stockton 2.
Mr. Graves' eyes were full of dust yes
terday afternoon that quite shut out the
line of the ball as It did or did not pass
fiver the plate at the Recreation Grounds.
His decisions were streaked with errors,
though the game in no way depended upon
hls'poor decisions.
Fireman Fits pitched immaculate ball
for seven out of the nine Innings. It was
In the seventh that his curves were un
raveled by the farmer stickmen who put
a figure on the board against Stockton's
name. The local team had. already scored
four runs at the time, enough to win the
game, and Fltz allowed no other hits.
Harper was touched only six times, but
he received poor support from his men.
The third inning registered a brace of
runs for the local team. Peeples earned
first by an honest hit and coursed the
four bags when Fltzpatrick rolled out a
double. The fireman stepped over the
rubber on a passed ball by Pace.
Schwartz hit a three bagger In the fourth
and walked home on Reilly's single. The
last run of the Wasps was made in the
sixth, when Schwartz again crossed the
plate.-
In the seventh Inning the game livened
up a bit. Pace singled and skirted the
cushions *n third on Babbitt's hit.- the lat
ter taking third on the throw in. Then
Morrow took a constitutional and the
bags were crowded.
Something had to happen to ease the
fans. It came in the way of a long drive
to center from Streib's bat. Pace and
Babbitt scoring. One .farmer had been
laid to rest at this time and the team
was retired when Moore shot a liner to
Levy, who doubled Morrow at second.

Spurred on by the offer of numerous
prizes, the people of the town are vying
with each other in the wealth and variety
of their decorations. Three arches span
the principal streets. First the Pioneer
arch, a span of evergreens with the
"Pioneer" outlined in electric lights,
reaches across Myers street and under
this the delegates coming from the sta
tion all passed. Then across Montgom-
cry street, opposite the United States
Hotel, is the Patriotic arch, decorated
with the red, white and blue and studded
with lights, and farther up Montgomery
street, opposite the new Convention Hall,
Is the Native Sons' arch, built In imita
tion of a solid pile of granite and lined
with lights. Down Myers street and
along Montgomery, between the two
arches, strings of lights strung across
the streets add luster to the scene.
The color scheme of the house decora
tions, besides the three colors of the flag.
is olive and gold, the olive for the olive
and the gold for the oranpe. the two
fruits tnat have so materially helped to
make Oroville what she is. Everything
Is decorated from the sidewalk line
almost to the roof. And the business
houses are not alone in their display. All
through the side streets the houses show
the festive colors and the whole town
seems bound to deck itself In its pret
tiest. It certainly has succeeded marvel
ously well.
The success of the celebration will un
doubtedly be due to one thingâ the will
ingness of the people to pull together to
make of every phase of the occasion an
assured success. The schools have been
closed for the week.
The accommodations committee has se
cured every vacant room in town and as
soon as a stranger comes along he is
turned over to G. W. Braden. the chair
man, who fits him out with a place where
he can be comfortable. Strangers axÂ«
stopped on the street and asked if they
have been provided for and members of
the committee are ready to meet ever 7

Major A. F. Jones, chairman of the com
mittee on arrangements, has given up his
office as a headquarters for the local par
lor and he spends his time on the street

no one thinks of passing him without

Even the Chinese have caught the fes
tive spirit and they are eager to help out.
They will narade in the- street procession

a long time they sought for a suitable

NEILL COMPANY
ACTS SMOOTHLY
"Captain Lettarblair" Is a clean, bright
Â«Lnd healthy play, cleverly constructed
and Talriy full of humor and action. The
paxt of Lettarblair is almost wealthy with
adroit lines which, although they are fre
quently reminiscent, are not the less tak
ing. Mr. Nelll plays it tellingly, with a
judicious mingling of reserve and freedom
that impresses one with his intelligence.
This very indulgence seems to perme
ate the whole performance, which is care
ful in every detail without beir.g either
sensationally brilliant or fatiguingly
dull. The t.isemo*e is symmetrical, and
there is evidence In the work of every
member oi the cast the Influence of a con
trolling spirit which directs, suggests and
ccntrois. It Is undoubtedly Mr. Seill who
e.cts most of the other parts, as well as
his own. and the result of hi* sane and
sincere efforts Is a most gratifying
smoothness in all the minor morals of
etagecrart.
Ine coTEpar.y is making friends and will
probably make money auring its engage
mtr.t. ior the work of Mr. Nelll and nis
players is so good that It is sure to in
duce those who have seen htm and heard
mem once to go again.
Comment on the various members of
the cast would simply mean a general
eoxnmendaUoa for ail those memoera of
the cast who are given parts of which
there la anything to be made. Julia Dean
ar.d George Bioomquegt have not euca
parts. Lut some of tne others axe so well
cone that they are quite convincing. The
fcm'.;.hers of John Burton and the jorkins
of HmmÂ«?tt Shackelford axe particularly
well carried. Miss Chapman makes a
Â£oÂ«_'d deal of h*r part and acts wita a
ueaj&ns naturalness.

COUNT LAUTERAC ARRESTED
ON CHARGE OF FORGERY
GERMANY OFFERS NO
HOPE TO THE BOERS
French Nobleman Apprehended by
Detectives at Auditorium Hotel
in Chicago.
CHICAGO. April 22.â Comte de Coulouse
Lauterac was arrested tc-day at the Audi
torium Hotel on a charge of foreery. It
is charged that the Count visited Quebec,
Canada, two weeks ago and forged pa
pers to secure mor.ey.
The amount of the p.llegcd forgery 13
not given, but It is said to be large. To
day a detective, who has been tracing
Lauterac. saw him enter the hotel and
ask for his mall. At the detective's re
quest the police arrested the Count and
took him to the Harrison-street Police
Station, where he was locked up.
The Countess Lauterac Is said to be the
daughter of the Countess de Intreville,
one of the wealthiest women In Paris.
She was with her husband when he was
arrested and broke down wnen sne real
ized what was taking place. She return
ed to the house of friends In this city.
I^auterac is a Frenchman. His mar
riage occurred in Paris eight months ago.
The Count Is about -13 years of age. He
Is a handsome man and dresses well. His
wife is only 20 years old and speaks noth
ing but French.
â¢â¢Why should I obtain money t>y for
gery," said he. "when my motr:;r-in-law
has twenty-two houses In Paris and Is
worth o.CÂ«JO.OO>) francs? It is preposterous
and nonsensical. It is a disgrace to me
and an outrage on my wife and her family.
I don't believe that the a^ice of this city
have any right to arrest me and incar
cerate me In a police station just because
some man points me out and says that I
am wanted In Quebec. I will see that I
have my rights as an American citizen
and a resident of Chicago."

BERLIN. April 22.-The semi-official
Berliner Post publishes an Inspired arti
cle. In which It is said that the sentiment
regarding the Boers still remains friendly
throuehout German", but that the Gov
ernment sees no reason why the Boer
peace delegation should come to Berlin,
since no good could be gained from such
a visit. Germany being unable to render
the slightest service, either in friendly of
fices to both sides or in intermediation, bo
long as Great Britain remains determined
to reject both.

VIEWS FIRE DRILL
Commissioner Grattan of Buffalo
Praisss Efficiency of the San
Francisco Department.
A fire drill was given yesterday morn-
Ing by Chief Sullivan of the loc&l depart
ment for the benent of W. S. Grattan, one
of the Fire Commissoners of Buffalo, N.
Y. First Assistant John Dougherty aided
Chief Sullivan, and there were also pres
ent M. H. Hecht and John Grady, mem
bers of the San Francisco Fire Commis
sion.
Mr. Grattan has been here a week and
has made a complete Inspection of the de
partment. At the drill yesterday com
panies 5. 12 and 2S and the water tower
were ordered out, the drill taking place
nt Kearny r.nd Bay streets. The steamer
companies were put through the usual fire
fighting course. Commissioner Grattan
was much pleased with the manner In
v.-hich the men handled their engines and
ran out their hose and praised their work
highly.
It was the tower that seemed to im
press the visitor the most. After watching
the three-Inch stream whizzing horizon
tally into space from its elevated source
Mr. Grittan examined the machine mi
nutely and pronounced it one of the best
he had ever seen. He was impressed with
the mechanism by which it can be ad

this morning at her home, 33SA San Jose
avenue.
When the Morgue deputies arrived on
the scene they found In the room wherÂ«*
the body lay an empty bottle which had
contained lysol. No reason could be
ascribed for the act except that the wo
man was despondent from sickness.
Counsel for Owens.
ST7ISUN. April 22.â John Owens, who
confessed Friday to having murdere-1
Daniel H. Wilson, was to-day visited by
his brother, Henry Owens, of Healdsburg.
The latter secured the services of an at
torney to represent the defendant at the
preliminary examination, which will be
held next Wednesday. It is not thought
here by those who have followed the Wil
son case that Mrs. Lucy Owens was im
plicated In the crime. Owens still main
tains a morose front and has asked that
no one be allowed to visit him.
Charged With Murder.
LOS ANGELES, April 21â An Inquest
was held this afternoon on the body of
"Pelon" Johnson, the half-breed who was
stabbed through the heart Friday night.
The verdict of the jury charged llateo
Castillo, in whose house the dead man
was found, with the crime. Castillo testi
fied at the Inquest and was arrested soon
after. His own testimony incriminated
him.

Along Market Street, but Are
Upset by Sergeant

Joseph "WoUe, a dealer In bicycles, start
ed out last night to do a little advertising
on his own account. To a sextuplet he
attached two signs, on which were print
ed his name and the location of his eye-
Jery. Accompanied by three young women
In striking bloomers, and two other men.
he rode the machine down Market street.
They r&ced along at a furious pace, the
women shouting to the astonished pe
destrians and the men making more noise
than Is heard In a country schoolhouse
during the temporary absence of the
teacher. At Fourth street Sergeant of Po
lice Wolf ordered them to "pull up," and
was greeted by derisive shouts and cries
of "Get off the earth." SuminoEir.gr OfS
cer Saye, Wolf lay In wait for the ma
chine to return. A few minutes later It
reappeared, the riders shouting defiance
to 'several other "coppers" who tried to
stop them.
It was going at the rate of almost twen
ty miles an hour when It reached Wolf,
but this did not dismay him. He made a
flying- leap for Wolle. who was occupying
the first seat of the sextuplet. The col
lision upset the machine, spilling the rid
ers onto the street. Wolf promptly grab
bed Wolle, while Saye succeeded in hold
ing on to another of the riders, who gave
his name as C. L. Braun and his occupa
tion as that of a tailor. The three women,
after brushing the dust off their bloom
ers, took the advice of a bystander and
ran down Fourth street. On account of
the large crowd that had gathered the
officers, fearing that they would lose their
two prisoners, did not follow them. Woile
and Craun were taken to the City Prison,
where they were charger with violating
the bicycle ordinance.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, APRIL 23, 1900.
SENATOR STRATTON
ARRAIGNS CLERGY
Demands More Tolerance in Their
Attitude Toward Those of
Different Views.
Remarkable Address Delivered Before Young
People's League of the First
Unitarian Church.
Oakland OfT.ce San Francisco Call,
111S Broadway. April 22.
(Fji TN'ATOR FREDERICK S. STRAT-
TON. one of the most prominent
Osâ-^ ro!it!clar.s in the State, a leader of
the Lar of California and at the fore
In movements for civic advancement In
Oak'.ar.d. made a remarkable public ar
rairr.ir.er.T to-night cf the clergymen of
Th!s< city. H* demanded more tolerance in
their attitude toward thos<Â» of different
religious belief*, expressing himself as
profoundly disappointed over the recent
public utterances of the leading divines of
LhJa city. He likened the present religious
situation to that which existed in Crom
weO'a day. when men were deprived of
life and property for daring to diSfer from
the preval3lr.gr religion.
S-nator Stratton spoke as a layman and
r merrier cf enÂ« of the most prominent
orthodox churches of the cityâ the Firs'
â¢ "repaticr.al. His address was delivl
. 7-d before the Young People"s League of
ih* First Unitarian Church, and his sub
:<ect was "Better Churches for Oakland. #-
In opening he declared not for finer and
pr&r.der edifices, but for a broader char
ity, which should mean a tolerant regard
for all those who differ in religious views.
Continuing. Senator Stratton said:
"I had thought that Oakland, with the
high character cf Its <Jlvir.es and with the
tendency of the times more ar.d more to
ward relig.ous toleration, would at this
time a.n<S in this place have taken an ad
var.ced position 'or freedom of religious
belief. The public utterances, however.
Of the three leading ministers of Oaklar.d
Â«ithln the past few months have been to
me a source of profound disappointment. '
"Disguised tjr-cer whatever specious plea
It may be clothed, whether or not it be Im- j
yugr:lr:g the motives of one's adversaries, j
which is a weak subterfuge in all ccn- i
troverey. I find that the leaders of re- I
ligicus thought here very scantily admit I
i).f right of rthers to differ upon theolog
ies', questions, and disclose very little
charity, and certainly no love, for one
who has charged his doctrinal belief.
"It is with r^rret that I speak these Â¦
words on this occasion. I would, indeed, J
rather address them to an orthodox audi- |
crce. among whom as a member and reg- i
u!ar attendant I count myself, than to a '
Unitarian a!>Â«err.b!age. I listened to an
exceedingly able sermon some time ago tn
the Congregation Church in this city upon
the text from Revelations as given by
John, where he said, speaking of the new
Jerusalem. "I saw no temple there.' It
was explained that the temple was as
broad as the city and included in Itself
all within its walls. Ar.d so I would Ilk-?
the better churches cf Oakland to exhibit
a broader spirit, ar.d while preaching their
respective doctrine:- to exclude from hos
tile denunciation those who cannot con
sistently accept thf-m. and to abound in
charity and love toward those who seek
differently for light or truth, wherever it
may l>e found."
The speaker dwelt at some length on
the dogmatic differences in theology, re
ferrins to much critical discussion now In
progress. He alluded to an address by Dr.
Kurrill delivered at Yale University,
where that divine had declared that a be
lief in the doctrine of the atonement was
essential to salvation, and that to believe
the contrary was to l^atyue one's self with
satan. Senator Stratton said that upon
that argument Dr. Burrill would be corn
relied to say that Rev. C. R. Brown, pas
tor of the First Congregational Church of
Oakland. wa= a disciple of satan. for the
speaker had heard Dr. Brown declare that
belief In the doctrine of atonement was
rot essential to salvation. Concluding.
Senator Stratton said:
"Contention has been the rule always In
the past, coupe very generally with in
s!stÂ«r.ce that the right of conscientious
difference does not exist. I would like to
tee the better churches of Oakland elimi
nate contention, and let all denominations
stand upon the truth of their doctrines as
they address themselves to human Intelli
gence. I must finish with an expression
of the true optimism which I feel. The
better churches of Oakland may In some
measure by their toleration and liberalism
advance Just a little the spiritual and ma
terial good of the community. In the time
of William of Orange men slaughtered one
another for religious differences. In Crom
wel!"e time men stripped those who dif
fered with them spiritually of their
wealth and ofHces. To-day we save their
Jives and their property, tut the tendency
is still, en the part of many, to exe
crate tnose who differ, and to deny to
them that right of dlfferer.ee which ought
to be one of the basic principles of hu
manity."

OUTPUT OF GOLD
IS TOLD OF IN
GREAT FIGURES
Sixteen Millions the State's
â¢Yield of Minerals Last
Year.
Indications of Activity Among the
JOiners, All of Whom Are Pre
paring 1 to Take Advantage
of Modern Processes.
Alaskan gold and silver received at as
say offices, mints, refineries and smelt
ers, representing the output of the Terri
tory for 1859, amounted to $5,831,355, which
was an Increase over the product of the
previous year of $3,190,544. Statistician
Yale of the United States Mint, who fur
nishes the figures, estimates that 12.400.
000 came from Cape Nome, the placers of
which opened up last year. The quartz
mines of Southeast Alaska made up the
remainder of the Increase. In these
quartz mines 1050 stamps are dropping.
The district designated Includes Douglas
and Unga Islands. The quartz mines pro
duced $2,704,176 and the placers $3,217,179.
This Indicates that all the placer districts
in Alaska, including the hydraulic mines
near Juneau, produced only $727,179. The
Klondike last year produced $15,254,107 In
gold and stiver, a total increase of $0,028,
198 over the product of 1898. The sliver
production amounted to $267,330.
The Copper, Zinc and Lead Review of
Xew YorK says that unusual attention is
now given to lead mining, the reason be
ing that the metal has steadily advanced
In price during the last year, and that iv
is holding It 3 own. The reason assigned
is that there have been found new uses
for it. One of these is in the construction
of storage batteries in motor carnages.
Each motor carriage has at least 300
pounds of lead in It. There is one storage
battery company that is paying out $1.20u,
000 per annum for lead. The underground
conduits also largely consumed lead, and
the demand in that direction will Increase.
There are promising lead deposits In Call-
The copper production of thÂ© world for
the year 1899 was 473.818. long tons. The
total increase in the United States was i
gow' product of California decreased
$570,447 last year, as compared with I>9Â§.
while the silver o^P"* l "Â£ reased *^ ?â¢%sâ¢ ,
The net decrease was $450,000 In round fig
ures The reason of the decrease was the
lack of water, which seriously hamperea
mining operations. !
Nevada County retains the place of Â¦
"banner county*" and Tuoiumne County
takes the second place, forging ahead of
Amador County. Calaveras County shows
the largest Increase In Product The
largest decrease is in Placer County..

tion of the gold and silver product by
counties during the year 1599:

THE third district of the League of
the Cross Cadets held a rally and
essay contest at Metropolitan Tem
ple yesterday afternoon. The sub
ject of the essays was cigarette smoking.
Private J. O"Brlen of St. Patrick's parish
won the prize, a gold medal. Two other
parishes were represented by Private J.
Seymour of St. Rose's and Lieutenant
Charles Adams of the Paulista.
The chairman of the rally was James E.
"Power, formerly captain of Company H,
and the Judges who passed on the merits
of the essays were Rev. Father Flnnegan
and . W. H. Humphries. The meeting
opened by the singing of the "Venl Cre
ator." Seymour was the first contestant
to speak. He discussed at length the im
moral effects of the cigarette habit. He
then passed on the savings that* a young
man could make from abstenance from
the article, even if he smoked only one
5-cent package a day.
Private O'Brien followed. He said In
. part: "If a man abuses the sublime gift
I of intelligence he is lower than the lowest
I brute. Cigarettes are proven a deadly
poison to the system, and consequently
any one who will wantonly indulge in the
habit is a low creature. Some people
claim that after a youth has passed the
age of â¢ sixteen cigarettes are harmless.
but this is mere speculation, as medical
men claim that tobacco dulls the brain
and brings on all kinds of diseases. If we
would .Â¦ have lofty aims we : should never
use tobacco. To become- prominent s we
should have the respect of our neighbors.
The only way to gain their regard is by
1 temperance." Â¦ , -

It was a proud privilege. Rabbi Levy
said, to deliver the invocation and parti
cipate in the .festive service.. Thirty years
ago he had stood at the same altar and
delivered the invocation. Since that time
he had seen the congregation prosper be
yond man's expectations, and he prayed
that the grace of God might continue to
be with the prosperous congregation and
the men who led It. . "Â«'-'.'â¢-.â¢.
"May many of the rising members of
the congregation of Sherith Israel cele
brate Its centennial, and may Its progress
and usefulness be just as marked during
the coming fifty years as during the fifty
gone by," was the rabbi's closing senti
ment. . '
Rabbi Frledlander extended the sympa
thy and love of fellow congregations in an
address that contained allusions to the
farly struggles of the congregation. .' On
the email foundation laid fifty year-* be
fore had been reared, he said, the strong,
grand and glorious structure. ' to whljh
the spiritual brethren of all the other con
gregations now sent greetings, and
through him had come to share in the
glory of Sherith Israel.
Rabbi Nieto's address dwelt mainly with
the history of the congregation. Youthtul
minds, he said, could not grasp the mean-
Ing of the words "fifty years of activity" â
of what a half century of existence, with
all its etruggles and trials, meant. Older
members of Sherith Israel looked back
over the fifty years of the congregation's
existence, and the time seemed so full
that ft was impossible to tell of it in an
hour. It would take days to tell the his
tory of a single individual.
The foundation of the Congregation
Sherith Israel at a time when the present
Bite of San Francisco consisted of sand
hills, lagoons and a few tents and a few
shanties' was brought about through its
founders' desire for good and the uplift
ing >of the honor and the vindication of
the character of the Jewish race, said the
eloquent rabbi. He told briefly the his
tory of the congregation, as follows:
On- April 13, ISSO, Joseph Joseph was
elected president and Samuel H. Cohen
secretary of a committee on organization.
The other members were:- H. Hart, Hon.
A. Weiss, M. Hart. S. Blankenstein, Israel
Solomon and Isaac Nathan. Merchants
court, on Washington street, was made a
temporary place cf worship. A synagogue
was built In 1&54 and dedicated September
8, by LÂ»r. Julius Eckman. rabbi. Rev. H.
A. Henry was elected minister and chazan
September 1, 1557. He was succeeded by
Dr. Aaron J. Messing, who dedicated the
present synagogue on August 26, 1860. It
was built under the direction of a com
mittee consisting of C. Meyer, Fabian
Toplitz and J. Funkensteln.
Dr. Messing was succeeded by Dr.
Henry Vidaver. June 14. 1573. who died on
the first day of Rosh Hashonah, Septem
ber 14. 1882. He was succeeded by Dr.
Falk Vidaver, hia brother, who resigned
April SO. 1892. and he in turn was succeeded
by the speaker who was elected June 8,
1893.
Rabbi Voorsanger said the wells dug
by Abraham were permanent. Israelites
might go to all parts of the world, but
they followed tnelr traditions and dug
new wells. The men who Â¦ started this
congregation were "Princes of Israel," no
matter what their station In life, for with
faith and courage they had dug new
wells. It was a remarkable thing In Jew
ish history that during the turmoil of
early San Francisco men could be found
to keep up the Jewish traditions. They
should be honored for the well they had
dug.
The officers of the Sherith Israel are:
Dr. Jacob Nieto, rabbi; Louis Brown,
president: Judah Boas, treasurer; Rev. D.
S. Davis, cantor: Charles Harris, . vice
president: Alexander L. Badt, secretary,

sion covered the altar. All the pillars
were gayly bedecked with s mi lax and
roses. Palms and set pieces added to the
getferal effect.
The services opened promptly at 11:30
o'clock. The Bishop and the priests en
tered uttering their chants and were fol
lowed by members of the congregation
bearing lighted candles. Pistols and guns
were discharged and bells were rung to
proclaim the tidings that "Christ had
risen." Simultaneously members of the
church greeted each other with "Christus
vos kresse," and then embraced and ca
ressed one another three times. The
unique custom was carried out to the let
ter and the pretty girls, who were present
In great numbers, were not loth in offer
ing their faces for the kiss that was part
of the ceremony.

church during the services. The air was
thick with incense which curled up from
carved censors on either side of the altar.

A Pretty Romance.
The marriage of Miss Zona Metropolsky.
daughter of Rev. Nicholos Metropolsky of
the Greek church, to S. E. Snyder, a
wealthy New Yorker, at Grace Episcopal
Church last Thursday has just been made
public. It was an elopement, but one that
has resulted happily, for the bride's pa
rents accepted their now son-in-law with
out a murmur. In order to keep within
the laws of their religion, however, â¢ the
parents asked to have the marriage cere
mony repeated In the Greek church. The
young folks have consented and the cere
mony will be repeated next Sunday.
There is a pretty romance in the union
of these, young people. Snyder is the
grandson and only heir of Samuel Fox, a
New York capitalist, who has wintered in
California tor many years, and has a
large circle of friends and acquaintances
here. The young man came to this city
less than a month ago on a pleasure trip,
with the possibility of going Into busi- ;
ness here. A week after his arrival he |
met Miss Metropolsky, who was employed |
in a prominent hotel In the capacity of
interpreter. It was a case of love at first
sight on both sides. The ardent young!
lover made the hotel his headquarters andj
waited upon the object of his affection at*
all times. The young people feared to ask
the consent of Miss Metropolsky's parents
to their immediate union, so they laid
their plans to be married on last Thurs
day and to leave town at once.
Thursday evening they dined at Zlnk
and's and were met there by George Aba
die of Amapala. Honduras, a steamer ac
quaintance of Snyder, who had procured
the license and accompanied them to
Grace Church, where the ceremony was
performed by Rev. Mr. Foute. Afterward
the party attended the theater and later
drove to the Occidental Hotel, where Mr.
and Mrs. Snyder are still stopping. A
brother of the bride first h^ard of the i
wedding and hastened to the hotel to wish I
them joy. The reconciliation with the I
bride's parents was soon arranged. After
the marriage ceremony is performed ac
cording to the rites of the Greek church,
the young folks will probably go on a
wedding trip to New York to secure
grandfather's blessing.

John Dempsey and Wife
Suspected of Murdering
Charles Burke.
Victim's "Watch and Money Found
Concealed in the Residence
, of the Prisoners on
Natoma Street.
Â»â¢Â» â¢ -
Charles Burke, a longshoreman living
at 540 Minna street, met death under sus
picious" circumstances in the house occu
pied by John Dempsey and wife, at 209
Natoma street, shortly before midnight
last night. The first Information was con
veyed to the authorities by Mrs. Demp
sey, who said Burke had fallen down the
front steps as he was taking his depart
ure, after spending the evening with her
self ; and husband, striking his head
against the edge of one of the steps and
fracturing his skull. There was a big
hole in the man's head and the Morgue
officials were of the opinion that it had
been made by a blow with some blunt in
strument. The body was removed to the
Morgue. The pockets were turned inside
out, but nothing of value was found on
the person of the dead man.
Robert Ford, who had been Burkes
roommate, told Policeman Beamer that
when he last saw Burke, In the morning,
he had a gold watch and between $30 and
$40 In money. The officer at once proceed
ed to Investigate the circumstances sur
rounding the alleged accident. Mrs.
Dempsey declared that Burke was drunk
when he came to the house, that his pock
ets were inside out then and that he had
neither money nor jewelry. Beamer was
not satisfied and placed both Dempsey and
his wife under arrest. A search of the
house disclosed Burkes watch and $2S
hidden under a pillow on a lounge in the
parlor of the house.
The Dempseys were piaffed in the tanks
at the City Prison, but will not be charged
until the police have further investigated
the affair.
The Morgue records show that a man
named Thomas Gill was removed from the
Dempsey house in an unconscious condi
tion on the night of March 18 and died a
few hours later. As in the case of Burke,
the Dempseys said GUI had received his
injuries by falling down the front steps
while drunk.
