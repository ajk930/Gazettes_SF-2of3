Special Dispatch to The Call
SUISUN. April 2i).â The mystery sur
rounding the killing of Daniel H.
Wilson, the Suisun Valley orchard
ist, who was assassinated at the
door of his home on the night of Oc
tober 9. 1595, has at last been cleared up,
and the murderer is behind prison bars,
with enough evidence to convict him of
the foul crime. John L. Owens is the man
who took Daniel Wilson's life, and all sus
picion of a doubt as to his guilt was re
moved to-day when he confessed to the
crime.
Owens was taken Into custody yesterday
on the ranch of J. S. Jones, about one mile
from the town of Madison. Yolo County.

Sheriff Frank P. Grace of Sonoma County
were with Sheriff Savage at the time the
arrest was made. Tho officers and pris
oner drove to the jail at Falrfleld, arriv
ing there at dusk last evening. After be
ing placed in Jail several ineffectual at
tempts were made to Induce Owens to
make a statement regarding the murder,
but he remained firm, and outside of a few
minor admissions would give the officers
no Information further than what had
been obtained by them from other per
sons. This morning, however, Owens fell
Into tho trap that had. been set for him
and told what will probably send him to
the gallows. â¢
Charles James, employed by Curtln's
Detective Agency of San Francisco, Is the
man who obtained from" the prisoner this
morning the statement that was necessary
for a conviction. The conversation be
tween the two men was overheard by
Deputy Sheriff Fred Clark, who was se
creted in an' adjoining cell in the jail.

Confession of Owens.
The killing of Wilson took place on the
evening of October 9. It occurred shortly
after 8 o'clock. Owens said that he left

DYNAMITE PACKING
HOUSE EXPLOSION
Three Men Blown to Atoms and
Neighboring Buildings Reduced *
to Wreckage.
BAT CITY, Mich.. April 20.â The pack
ing house of the Ajax Dynamite Works
near the village of Kawkawlin. this coun
ty, was blown up this afternoon, killing
three men. The dead:
WILLIAM WEVER.
EDWARD HALLIGAN
WILLIAM VANVLASSAR.
All left young widows and children.
Their bodies were torn to shreds, only
enough being found to fill a bushel-basket.
Great trees were uprooted or torn to pplln

were wrecked by the force of the explo

owner of the works. It is believed the
explosion, which is the fourth in seven
yf-ars, was caused by one of the men
dropping a pailful of dynamite on the
floor. The financial loss 13 slight.
MANY SACKS OF MAIL
FOR "HEALER" TRUTH
BOSTON, April 20.â Twelve sacks of mall addressed to Francis Truth, the
divine healer, "who was arrested recently charged with fraud, have been im
pounded by the Unlti A States Government under the usual "fraud order."
Many of the thousands of letters contained in the twelve mall sacks carry
money for "absent treatment." Truth's usual charge was $5 for absent treat
ment, so that necessarily the amount of money contained In the letters is
very large. The twelve sacks of mall will be opened by the postal authori
ties. The letters which bear names and addresses on the envelopes will be re
turned to the writers. The other letters will be sent to the "Dead Letter '
Office" at Washington to be opened. What money Is contained In these let
ters will be returned to the writers.
away from him. He was shown the gun
which the officers had secured, and he
admitted that It was the one with which
he killed Wilson.
While Owens denied to-day that his
wife knew that he was connected in any
manner with the killing, he had previous
ly asked one of the Jail officials If his
wife had given him away. Just after the
murder of Daniel Wilson was committed.
B. F. Rush, who was. the Sheriff at that
time, was of the opinion that the house
keeper, Mrs. Lucy Owens, or her hus
band, were either responsible for the
crime or. in some way connected with It.
In this opinion Mr. Rush was opposed by
the other officials, still he placed Mrs.
Owens and her brother-in-law under ar
rest, but they were, soon discharged for
lack of evidence. Mr. Rush's subsequent
efforts to connect Owens with the crime
were of no avail.
Trailing the Murderer.
Relatives of the murdered man were ar
rested In January, 1599, and after their
discharge attention was once more direct
ed to the Owens family. It was in Oc
tober of. that year that District Attorney
Devlin obtained a clew upon which he
could work. A month later he secured
the first positive Information connecting
John Owens, with the crime. It was In
the form of a statement from a man who
was In -possession of Important facts.
Mr. Devlin employed Detective Curtln of
San Francisco and Sheriff Frank P. Grace
of! Santa Rosa was also taken Into the
case. The latter worked up all clews fur
nished him and -worked vigorously In con
nection with the other officials. Two
months ago Mr. Curtin detailed Charles
James, a member of his force, on the
case. James went to Healdsburg and soon
won the confidence of Owens. He pre
sented himself as an ordinary laborer.
For several weeks the two men traveled
in different parts of the State together,
most "of the time sharing the same beds.
They have been In several mining coun
ties and worked here and there. Owens
secured work at the Jones ranch, near
Madison, last Monday, his supposed part
ner remaining in town. It was then that
the arrest was planned. District Attorney
Devlin consulted with Sheriff Savage, and
on Wednesday Sheriff Grace was sent for.
As has been heretofore stated the arrest
was made Thursday afternoon, and while
en route to'Falrfleld James was met on
the road, as had been prearranged. He
seemed much surprised and displayed In
dignation at Owens' arrest, and agreed to
follow the latter to Falrfleld. Coming here
by -. train a sham arrest .was made and
James was placed In Jail.
Prisoner. ls Calm.
Having become firmly convinced that the
officials were. Jn possession of the facts of
the shooting Ovi,ns told James this morn
ing that he did kill Wilson. Owens was
calm throughout. He Btlll shows no signs
of nervousness nor does he know the part
that James played in the case.
John . Owens, the slayer of Daniel H.
"Wilson, is a, man about 50 years of age.
He Is medium 'built, about 6 feet 7 Inches
In height.. He was at one time a resident
of Fairfleld. and before going to Healds
burg in ISO 2 lived temporarily in Suisun
Valley. He has relatives living In this
vicinity. His own family consists of a
wife and two children, one a son of 17 and
a daughter two years younger. -.-Â¦:Â¦
It lsa peculiar fact that the very night
of the murder Owens' wife had decided to
leave -Wilson, so that the slaying of the
aged man appears to have; been a useless
crime on the part of the wronged husband.
EXCURSIONISTS WERE
ABANDONED BY CLARKE
Members of the 111-Fated Party Left
in Europe and Many Are
Penniless.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON. April 20.â The steamer New
England, which carried the 111-fated party
of wealthy excursionists from all parts
of the country to Mediterranean ports.
! under the management of F. C. Clarke,
arrived in Boston from Liverpool to-day
with some of the stranded party on board.
Among the original party were many
California people, including Miss Hall B.
Childs. Miss Sarah D. Crosby. Miss Sarah
Coleman. John B. Luther. Rev. James F.
Nugent. In addition there were people \
from Pasadena and other parts of Cali
fornia. It is not known where any of
these are now.
The members of the Clarke party who
returned to-day denounce in emphatic
terms the conduct of F. C. Clarke, who.
they claim, abandoned them In Rome
when he knew that they had been In
fected with smallpox, and that they were
without resources owing to his assurances
that for the sum of $500 or $600 a head he
would pay all the expenses of the trip,
and that the excursionists would need to
take with them only change enough for
tipping purposes. Captain McAuley says
that he had to leave Naples to escape
costly quarantine upon the discovery of
smallpox symptoms among the crew. It
Is understood that the management of
the party asked the captain of the vessel
to conceal the presence of smallpox on
board and to continue the trip as it had
been planned originally. This Captain
McAuley declined to do. Four of the pas
sengers died of the disease In Europe and
a large portion of the party is now scat
tered all over the continent, many of
them probably infected and some of them,
it Is feared, penniless.

Incident.
CHICAGO. April 20.â The Duke d'Arcos
Incident arising from the Dewey Invita
tion was closed to-day, according to the
following communication received by
Mayor Harrison from the Spanish Min
ister at Washington:
It was very kind of you to s*nd the letter
received this mornlnr. From the flrst moment
I felt assured that all about the Invitation was
a mistake and that there was no Intention
whatever of an offense. At the same time I felt
that I could not drop the matter unnoticed.
Now it is a closed Incident and I thank you
again for your very courteous answer.
"I thought the explanation I sent was
sufficient to convince the Spanish Minister
that the matter was an oversight," said
the Mayor, "and this letter shows the
Duke is satisfied with the outcome of an
Incident that is to be regretted deeply."
DENVER'S PROTEST.
DENVER. Colo., April 20.â The hearing
before Interstate Commerce Commission

the members of the ring. The first in
timation of trouble came on Thursday
afternccn when the ring of lawyers dis
covered that Chief Dunn of the Chinese
Bureau was not sending any more re
ports to the Collector of the Port re
garding Chinese who claim a right to
land at this port.
As The Call has already explained,
the Collector of the Port, In consider
ing Chinese cases, acts ostensibly upon
recommendations from the Chinese
Bureau. This bureau is an expensive
piece cf Federal governmental machin
ery destined to test the claims of
every Chinese applicant for a residence.
Inspectors, interpreters and stenogra
phers are employed. Testimony is ta
ken, translated and transcribed and
then the bureau, weighing the evidence
in its possession, makes recommenda
tions for or against the application of
each claimant.
It was these recommendations which
Chief Dunn declined to make on Thurs
day, announcing with his refusal the
startling information that Special
Agent of the Treasury Chanler was
making an investigation of the records
cf the bureau and that no further rec
ommendations would be made until the
inquiry was concluded. The members
of the ring were dumfounded. Their
illegitimate criminal traffic had been
brought to a standstill. Their ill-gotten
profits' were cut short without warn
ing.
There are on the Pacific Mail dock
and on the Nippon Maru over 500 Chi
nese, clamoring for a landing. Their
fellows had found it easy to break
through the barriers of the law, and the
newcomer;? could not understand why
there should be delay in their cases.
Chinese coaches are jabbering instruc
tions and warnings from the dock, but

son made his unexpected decision, that
their discomfiture was complete. The
lawyers. Plppy, Bell and the others,
met in the office of the Collector of the
Port as usual. They wanted no more
delay.
It was then Collector Jackson quietly
informed them that he would have
nothing more to do with "native-born"
cases. He declared that not only would
he not land any more, but that he
would not consider any more cases, and
if the attorneys wanted to test the
right of the coolies to land they must
go to the United States courts for writs
of habeas corpus directed not against
him, but against the transportation
companies. The lawyers pleaded and
begged. They advanced argument
after argument, but Collector Jackson
was obdurate.
"I have been reading considerable law
In the last few days," he said. "The
Call has taught me some law and I
have come to the conclusion that I have
no business with Chinese 'native-born'
cases. Tou will have to take them to
the courts."
No argument could change that de
cision. The traffic in "native sons" had
collapsed. Expose and a plain state
ment of startling facts had worked a
remarkable change. The lawyers in
sisted that the law provides that a writ
of habeas corpus can only be obtained
after the Collector of the Port has re
fused to land a Chinese. The point was
not by any means well taken. The con
dition that the Collector must first re
fuse to land a Chinese before a writ can
be issued was introduced in the writs
simply to please the late United States
District Judge Hoffman and to cover
a contention of prior residence on the
part of the applicant. Collector Jack-

AWFUL LEAP
OF A WOMAN
WOOING DEATH
Plunges From the Middle
Span of Brooklyn
Bridge.
PICKED UP BY A RIVER TUG
It Is round Xo Bones Are Broken
and If Not Injured Internally
the Would-Be Suicide "Will
Recover.
Ni:W YORK, April 21.â ITlss Mary E.
I>in?e of this city Jumped from the
Brooklyn bridge at 2 o'clock this after
r.oon without serious injuries. Many men
have made this leap into the waters of
the East River since the bridge was com
pleted. Most of them have perished. Miss
Dinse Is the second woman who has ever
attempted to end her life in this way.
She Is now in the Hudson-street Hospital.
The physicians found that no bones were
broken, but they say it !s po.-sible that
the has sustained internal injuries.
In the carriage In which she drove to
the middle span of the bridge was found
a brooch on which was engraved "M.
Dlnse. May 22, ISS7," and she also was
ldentlfled through papers on her person
as Miss Dinse. She Is about 32 years of
nge and formerly was owner of a board
ing house In this city.
She stepped from a carriage In motion
about fifty feet from the bridge tower on
the New York end and dropped to the
water below, striking, according to an eye
Â¦witness, about twenty feet from the Clyde
line pier. She was picked up by the crew
of the tug Tacoma, which was moored
near by. The fact that she had no money
ar.fl had ordered herself to be dri\'en to a
pioce In Brooklyn where she Is not known
leads the police to believe suicide was
planned.
Thomas I. Moss, a hackman, gives the
best account of the woman's act. She
npproach*-<l hira on Broadway and re
quested liim to take her to 112 Fulton
street. Brooklyn.
"She acted rather odd." said Moss, "and
I was a little afraid that I would lose my
pay. but 1 finally concluded to take the
chance. When we got to the ticket taker
on the bridge she had no money to buy
the ticket. She pulled a ring irom her
finger and offered it to the man as se
curity, but he trould not take it. I was
about to turn around and bring her back,
and hail party turned my horse, when
she said 1 would pet my money when we
reached Fulton street. So I paid the toll
ttnd Â¦went ahÂ«-ad.
"I was past the first tower and going at
a trot when 1 heard people calling. I
turned around and paw tne door of the
hack opr-n on the Fide nearest the prom
enade. The woman was about twelve
fe?t behind me. and climbing over the low
railing. Before the bridge policeman who
was r.rar could reach her she had
squeezed through a triangular hole be
twer-n the tree* s and dropped down. She
<31d not jump, just dropped."
A bridge policeman, on hearing the
crifs. dashed toward her, but a moment
too late. The woman struck the water
on her right Fide, and after the lirst
splash floated, drifting: dov.n stream, car
ried by the ebb tide. The tug Taeoma put
out and picked her up unconscious, and
after some delay she was removed to the
hospital.
For non-payment of Installments and
rent Miss DJr.s<? was dispossessed on
Wednesday from a boarding- house that
she nnd a man named F. M. Audln were

The Robertson Lumber Company lost Its

ing Into Chinatown. Of the 500 coolies
now in bond at 'ieast 120 claim to be na
tive-born citizens cf the United States,
having been born, according to the out
lage of perjured testimony, in San
Francisco. Of the Chinese detained on
the dock eighty-three have retained
ColoneJ George H. Plppy as their attor-
ney. These facts need no comment. A
man who has no right to practice in the
United States courts is employed to
land eighty-three Chinese coolies that
arrived within a period of twenty days.
Consternation ruled in the camp of
the lawyers when the announcement of
Chief Dunn was made, but it was not
until yesterday, when Collector Jack-
at work upon the records cf tho Chinese
Bureau. Pending that investigation
Chief Dunn of the Chinese Bureau has
refused to make any more recommend
ations in Chinese cases to the Collector
of the Port, and the corrupt operations
of the ring in landing "merchants,"
Â¦Â¦students" and coolies known as tour
ists has aiso been checked.
As The Call has already proved there
is a great nest of fraud and perjury,
purchased testimony and forgery hid
den in this phase of the trafllc in Chi
nese. Thousands of coolies, who had
absolutely no right to land, have forced
the barriers of the exclusion act and
have entered San Francisco as "mer
chants, students and tourists.". The in
spector of the treasury, who is now ex
amining the records of the Chines? Bu
reau, will find much in this field to com
pensate him for his pains. He is delv
ing in a mine of the grossest fraud, that
will furnish much food for the United
States Grand Jury and supply beyond
the possibility of doubt the evidence
sufficient to punish the members of the
corrupt ring for the outrage which the>
have inflicted upon the people of this
city.
The criminal conspiracy which has
resulted in the landing of 3000 "native
son" coolie citizens in thirty-four
months should be compelled to pay
something more serious than the pen
alty of exposure. And the evidence
with which to prove the guilt of the
members of the ring is in the Chinese
Bureau. An honest and thorough in
vestigation will bring the facts to the
surface and the United States Grand
Jury has full power to act.
This disastrous culmination of a
criminal deal which has been going on
in this cits* for over two years came
like a thunderbolt from a clear sky to
Collector Jackson Decides That the Federal
Courts Must Determine All Further Cases
nf Nstivp 9on^
son has decided that If Incoming Chi
nese want to land here as native born
citizens of the United States they ask
a great deal and must prove their
claim In the United States courts, which
demand something more than perjured
testimony as proof.
This decision of Collector Jackson,
rendered unfortunately after 3000 coolie
citizens have passed through his hands,
practically destroys the traffic In na
tive sons. The clique of lawyers that
Is now controlling the outrageous busi
ness Is extremely unlikely to face the
scrutiny of a court. It would cost them
too much. The Pacific Mall Company,
familiar as it is with violations of the
law. is not likely to dare to release the
cooiies now in custody. It Is probable,
therefore, that at least 120 "native
sons" will journey back across the Pa
cific Ocean at the expense of the Pacific
Mall and other steamship companies. A
triumph the value of which can hardly
be measured has been won. But the
fight to uphold the exclusion act and
to prevent a repetition of the gigantic
frauds which resulted in the landing of
10.000 coolies at this port in thirty-four
months is not by any means at an end.
The Call Is in a position to prove that
the grossest frauds are still being prac
ticed by this corrupt ring of lawyers In
connection with the landing of "mer
chants, students and tourists." The
proof of the fraud is in the most recent
records of the Chinese Bureau, in docu
ments filed within the last few days.
The officials will not have far to search
to obtain it- With this phase of the
evil suspended but not killed. It Is a
matter for the deepest congratulation
that the startling expose of The Call
has destroyed the gigantic evil which
made of the dregs of Asiatic civilization
native born citizens of the United
States.
C â , . â S HE Call has won a triumph of
groat material benefit to the
people of this State. The gi-
pantlc and outrageous traffic In
r'hlr.ese "native-born" citizens
has been brought to a sudden stand
still and the corrupt ring which has
prown rich by sending thousands of
"native son" coolies into this port must
fight their Asiatic voters through th 2
r<.ur:s of the United States If any more
of them are to be landed at San Fran
cisco. The expose cf The Call ha? had
its effect and Collector of tho Port John
P. Jackson announced yesterday that
he will not only refuse to land any
more "native-born" Chinese, but he
will !>OFitivply decline to discuss or
consider their right to land in this
country. The Collector of the Port has
ann uneed to the ring of scheming law
yer* that if they desire to land any of
their "native sons" they must get out
v. rits cf habeas corpus, not upon him,
but upon the responsible agents of the
Pacific Mail Steamship Company and
other transportation companies which
are shipping the coolies to this port.
If these writs are not demanded, and
in a vast majority of cases there is not
the slightest danger that they will be.
the Pacific Mail and other steamship
companies must return the coolie "na
tive sons" to Hongkong free of cost or
suffer the penalties prescribed by the
United States Government. This check
ing of a shameful, corrupt and out
rageous traffic, made by the expose of
The Call, is a signal triumph for the
people of San Francisco.
Upon its hee'.s comes another which
Is almost of ecual importance. Special

EMINENT PERSONAGES WHO WILL ATTEND THE CONFERENCE. I
.-Â¦Â¦Â¦,â¢.Â¦.-â¢ . i
Dr. William R. Huntingtnn, rector of I
Grace Church, asks a leading question in
this connection and answers it thus:
'"What is an ecumenical conference on
forolgn miNsiosTf? It is a reaching after
fosie method of concerted action in such
an attempt to Christianize the non-Chris
tian-portion of the inhabited earth as
shall be conimenfurate with the vastness
of the undertaking."
The first conference of this nature was
held in London in ISTB. Ten years later
the second was held, also In London. New
York is to have the third. It will be by
far the largest and most comprehensive
>et h'Â»ld. There will be more than 2000
delegate?. They comprise not only the
leading men and women from the clergy
and from the missionary fields, but emi
nent laymen of many nationalities.
Former President Benjamin Harrison
will cail the conference to order to-mor
row afternoon. Another one-time Presi
dent. Grover Cleveland, will have a part
In the great gathering. Other widely
known American laymen who will par
ticipate are United States Supreme Court
Justice David J. Brewer. John D. Rocke

Great Britain will send some of her
most renowned men, Eugene Stock, sec

Church of England, will be there, and
with him the Rev. Professor T. M. Lind

Earl of Moray of Scotland. Germany's
delegates will include some noted leaders,
as Dr. Schrelber and Dr. Merensky. India

The words "fortify" and "defend" appeared
to invite controversy and diplomatic complica
tions, and in view of the action of the ad
ministration In the Ilay-Paunce
fote treaty. It appears entirely needless to raise
a diplomatic Issue with England simply on
the use of words.
In the amended form ample authority is
ttven to the police to protect the canal against
destruction by evil-doers, and by the time the
canal is completed, six or eight years hence,
there will be full opportunity to determine
whether it should be permanently protected by
fortifications by our navy.
Following the meeting Shackleford of
Missouri filed with the House a minority
report, as follows:
The undersigned, while concurring In the Tim
orous American policy so ably and tersely
Ftated by Mr. Hepburn in behalf of the major
ity of the committMÂ». nevertheless do not con
cur in the recommendation that the bill do
pass in the form presented.
The act of Congress which authorizes the
building of the canal should contain an ex
plicit and direct assertion of the right of the
United States to build, own and control said
canal absolutely free from European dicta
tion.
The Clayton-Bulwer treaty, as so clearly
shown by Mr. Hepburn, long ago ceased to have
any bindinc force by reason of the conduct of
Great Britain. That being true, we should
strictly adhere to the Monroe doctrine and
stand by our traditional policy that Europe
will not be permitted to lntermlddle with
Cls-Atlantic affairs. It Is to the Monroo doc
trine that we. as a republic, must look for
safety. We should never, under any circum-
Btances. even tacitly admit that Europe has
the rtcht to so much as Interrogate us on
American questions, much less to limit our
action.
After citing Blame in support of this
view, the report adds:
This is the fundamental principle of our na
tional independence, and no exigency should be>
sufficient to cause us to even momentarily lose
sizht of it.
Will Oppose the Measure.
Representative Adamson says the
changes in the bill were suggested, as he
understands, by the Rules Committee, in
answer to the petition filed for the con
sideration of the Hepburn bill. AdamÂ«on
presented to the committee the petition of
125 Democratic members favorable to the
original bill at the same time that Hep
burn presented the petition of the Repub
lican members.
The only answer received by Adamson
was the statement made to him by Hep
burn that if the bill were amended a spe
cial rule for the consideration of the
measure could be secured. To this Adam
son dissented, stating that the petition
was for the original bill. He again ob
jected to the change when Hepburn made
known to-day that the rule for consider
ation could be secured if the amendments
suggested were authorized by the Com
mittee on Interstate and Foreign Com
merce. Under the circumstances, Adam
pon says, he will oppose on the floor of the
House the amendments omitting the
words "defend" and "fortification," as he
says, "the amendments emasculate the'bill
and surrender the case, leaving the bill
consistent with the Hay-Pauncefote
treaty.

Saloon Men Win Out and India Rub
ber Crackers Are a Thing of
the Past.
Fp^clal rMFjjatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL. April 20.â Mill Valley Is
to have her saloons this summer and the
thirsty tourist will be able to expend his
beer money openly and obtain his steam
without the India rubber cracker pur
chase which generally played a prominent
part in former duck-chasing expeditions.
The man who is responsible for all this Is
Superior Judge Angellotti in virtue of his
Honor's decision rendered in favor of the
defendant in the case of the Mount Ta
malpais Land and Water Company vs.
Mclnnes et al.
In the deed formerly given each pur
chaser of the company s land a clause was
inserted prohibiting the sale of liquor on
Fuch land under penalty of forfeiture of
fame. John Mclnnes and John LandgralT
were the most persistent opponents of this
clause in the company's contracts, and
for nearly three years the merry war be
tween saloon men and the land company
has been waged. Many subterfuges were
resorted to by the saloon men in order to
checkmate the prohibitionists of the tem
perance town. The most common was the
"cracker gag." as It became known.
Every prospective drinker had to go
through the farce of receiving an India
rubber cracker before his liquor was
passed over to him.
This and other evasions rendered the
anti-liquor clause ridiculous, and the de
cision of Marin's Superior Judge has been
hailed with general satisfaction. Â¦ In
February last Judge Angellotti sustained
the demurrer to the complaint of the li
quor men's attorneys, Lennon and Haw
kins, and denied the injunction the land
company sought to obtain against the li
quor retailers. Twenty days were granted
the corporation's attorneys to amend their
complaint against the saloon men and
their failure to do so In the given time
caused Messrs. Lennon and Hawkins to
seek final judgment In favor of their cli
ents with the result that the liquor men
can congratulate themselves on a big vic
tory.

RUSHING WORK ON
SIBERIAN RAILWAY
..
Port Arthur and Vladivostok May
Be Connected by Rail by .Next
August.
WASHINGTON, April 20.â Minister Con
ger reports that the Russians are working
with feverish activity to finish the rail
road between Moukden and Vladivostok,
the eastern terminus of tha Siberian rail
way, and he says the belief is that Rus
sia's two great strategic points In the Far
Eastâ Port Arthur and Vladivostok,
where she Is said to have garrisons var
iously estimated at from 120,000 to 200,000
menâ will be connected by rail not later
than August of this year.
As a matter of fact there Is already un
interrupted steam communication between
St. Petersburg and the Pacific over the
Siberian railroad, though at present It is
necessary to use the river route on the
Shilka.for that part of the distance be
tween Strelensk and Khabarovsk. The
schedule from St. Petersburg to Vladivo
stok Is nineteen days. It Is expected that
the gap in the railroad now covered by
the water route will be completed In about
eighteen months.
Minister Conger also reports the com
pletion of tha Chinese railroad from Tien-
tsln to Newchwang, 348 miles lonr. The
new line from Tientsin to Chinchow Is
already paying 5 per cent on the invest
ment, and it Is expected that the entire
line when opened will return 30 per cent.
ALARMING SPREAD
OF PLAGUE IN SYDNEY
Terrified Citizens Axe Fleeing Prom
the Infected City in
Thousands.
VANCOUVER. April 20.â Dr. Bennett, a
celebrated Sydney, Australia, doctor, en
route to England, waa a passenger on the
steamship Mlowera. which arrived here
to-day from Australia. Dr. Bennett said
that when he left Sydney the plague
seemed to bÂ« spreading with alarming
rapidity. The health authorities werÂ« un
able to control it and tnera were eeven
fresh cases a day In the city of Sydney
alone, to say nothing of the numerous
cases In the colony outside the city.
The latest Sydney papers at hand have
little else than plague news. The rush
of people to be Inoculated has overtaxed
the powers of the army of doctors flock
ing in from outside. The plague terror
has possessed the people, and they are
fleeing from the city In thousands. So
far, of the seventy-five, cases In Sydney,
all are clerks living In unsanitary lodg
ings.
The Mlowera brought passengers her*
from Honolulu, so that the quarantine
has evidently been relaxed there. These
passengers said that they were quaran
tined together and fumigated every day
for fifteen days before the arrival of the
steamer.

WELLINGTON
IS NO LONGER
A REPUBLICAN
Withdrawal of the Maryland
Senator From the Party
Is Announced.
Refuses to Support the Administra
tion's Philippine Policy and
the Porto Eicon
Tariff.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. WELLING
TON HOTEL. WASHINGTON*. April 20.-
Another Republican Senator, Wellington
of Maryland, will be shut out of the.party
caucus. He probably will vote with the
Republicans on most questions, but he
will occupy the position of an independent
and will be in the class with Senator
Teller of Colorado.
"I have been opposed to the acquisition
of the Philippines ai= a permanent policy,"
paid Senator Wellington to-day, when
asked about his course during the coming
campaign. "1 was opposed to the 15 per
cent <iiity on Porto Kican imports into
this country. This being my position, I
do not see mv way clear to support the
Philippine policy of the President and the
policy of levying a duty on Porto Rico
when they are embraced in the national
platform. 1 will Ftep aside. I do not in
tend to support a platform that is against
my convictions In such important par
ticulars. I do not intend to remain a
member cf the National Committee nor do
I intend to attend the Republican Nation
al Convention."
Senator Wellington said that his deci
sion did not mean that he would support
a candidate in opposition to President lie-
Kinley. It did mean that he would for the
time withdraw from any affiliations with
his party.
About one matter there is a diversity of
opinion. Senator Wellington takes it for
granted that he can withdraw from his
party for a time, the length of which he
will make to suit his convenience. When
he gets ready to do so he will return to
the fold.
According to Senator Hanna, a man
cannot shift his politics as he does his
coat. When Senator Wellington makes
up his mind to return as a. prodigal son he
may find. Senator Hanna fay?, that in
stead of pupping him on the fatted calf
he will be barred out of his oM home.
DEWEY HOPES TO WIN
SOUTHERN STATES
Admiral Disappointed Because Mr.
Cleveland's Recent Letter Did
Not Mention Him.
frp-clni rJ!nÂ»tch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, April 20.â Admiral
D*wcy is hesitating about issuing his
political Ftatement. Not only the admiral
but several of his friends are using up
<juite a good deal of gray matter In their
efforts to determine whether It would be
advisable for the Presidential candidate
to make any announcement of his position
on national Questions.
There are gentlemen close to the ad
miral who are urging him to speak and to
ppeak promptly. .There are others who
are impressing upon him the value of the
rule, "Silence is golden." The admiral Is
Inclined to regard this rule with favor
that now ts not the time for him to talk.
His mail and his callers assure him that
his candidacy is progressing favorably.
What Is there for him. to pain, he aÂ«ks
himself, by Issuing a statement? The
pÂ«ople know he Is a Democrat, they know
the character of the services he has per
formed for the country and they know
how he views many topics. To Rome ex
tent a statement would be a repetition of
what ha* already bfen stated. Therefore
why reapon for a statement?
The admiral at this rime rather favors
a policy of drifting. He thinks the time
to art is when an emergency arises. Ttie
ifuggeftion Jias been" made that h* should
make a public declaration of his views
on questions which will come before the
Kansas- City convention on the date of
the assembling of the delegates, or a few
clays earlier, so that its effect will be ring
ing In the delegates' ears.
The admiral- will give no indication of
Â¦what he proposes to do. savin r that while
he would like to oblige The Call, he feels
that he should not at this time violate
his "Silence is golden" rule. The ad
miral is closely watching political devel
opments in several States. His friends
are keeping him advised of the situation
and are actively endeavoring to break
the Bryan forces in his behalf. The ad
miral is particularly interested In Geor
gia and Texas. If the delegates in these
Btates can be torn away from the Bryan
movement and sent to Kansas City with
out instructions, or with instructions to
vote for the admiral, the latter believes
that the "Bryan South" will be trans
formed into a "Dewey South." Admiral
Dewey's friends appreciate the impor
tance of defeating Bryan in Alabama and
Texas, and thei?e two States will be, to
eozne Â«ortcnt, the preliminary skirmish
ground In the struggle between the Bryan
and the Dewey forces. V
Admiral Dewey's friends are somewhat
disappointed over the failure of former
President Cleveland to mention him
either directly or indirectly in his letter
of regret to the Thomas Jefferson dinner
of the Brooklyn Democratic Club. Mr.
Cleveland is recognized as favorable to
the admiral's candidacy, and it is said
that he might have given impetus to the
Dewey boom by inserting some references
to the admiral's candidacy in the letter
he sent to the club. There is reason to
believe that had Mr. Cleveland made
some pleasant reference to the admiral's
candidacy the statement of the political
views of the Manila hero would have
been forthcoming. The admiral's friends
are anxious, if it be determined ad\-isable
to make a statement, that it shall be is
sued at a happy moment and it may be
that the absence of fortuitous circum
stances has something to do with the in
decision of the admiral relative to its pub
lication.

STAND TAKEN
BY STRAUS
IS APPROVED
Department Satisfied as to
the Accuracy of His
Statements.
In Commercial and Political Circles
Abroad the Firm Action of the
United States Is Gener
erally Commended.
CONSTANTINOPLE, April 20.â The
firm attitude of the United States Gov
ernment regarding the claims of Ameri
cana, for losses and massacres In Armenia
is entirely approved in political and com
mercial circles, and it Is hoped that the
United States will steadfastly maintain its
demand, such a course being the only one
likely to succeed. It is thought that all
the powers should follow the same course,
not only concerning indemnities, but also
with regard to the increase of duty.
Negotiations regarding the American in
demnity are now being conducted in
Washington, owing to the presence there
of United States Minister Straus. When
the prohibition against American pork
was issued, Lloyd C. Griscom. American
Charge d'Affalres, addressed an energetic
note to the Porte.
WASHINGTON, April 20.â Secretary
Hay returned to Washington to-day from
Isew York. An accumulation of depart
mental business awaited him, but nothing
in the nature of an ultimatum directed to
the Turkish Government waa Included in
the mass of correspondence. It is ap
parent that, though determined upon posi
tive action, the State Department Is pro
ceeding decorously and with due precau
tions against being led into any position
which it cannot maintain. It may be
stated by authority that the State De
partment is entirely satisfied of the ac
curacy of Minister Straus' statement
relative to the promises made to him by
the Porte, notwithstanding the attempted
explanations and efforts to becloud the
issue by declaring that the Sultan's prom
ises were conditional. The Minister's dis
patches, sent while he was in Constanti
nople, are couched in exact terms; his
written statements were fully confirmed
by his oral explanations to the depart
ment upon his return to the United States,
and moreover the pledges he secured were
similar to those made to the two preced
ing United States Ministers to Turkey. In
the opinion of the State Department offi
cials, it Is inconceivable that three United
States Ministers should be successively
deceived in the terms of a promise or
should have reached similar misunder
standings.
The approval which the State Depart
ment's latest action seems to have re
ceived in Europe was anticipated, it being
realized here that several of the Conti
nental powers having claims similar to
our own against Turkey being themselves
prevented from initiating any forcible de
mands upon the Turkish Government by
reason of the jealousy of their neighbors
are entirely willing that the United States
Government shall act as a pioneer in this
matter and clear the way for a prosecu
tion of their own claims.
It Is also believed here that the Kuro
pean powers are hopeful that the attitude
assumed by the United States may indi
rectly serve to deter the Turkish Govern
ment from the proposed arbitrary in
crease of 3 per cent In customs duties
which it seeks to make in defiance of the
Joint protest of the European powers. It
appears that our Government is > lending
its moral support to this protest, for
while not joining with the others in the
combined note, our Charge, Mr. Griscom,
has been instructed to make representa
tions on our own account in opposition to
the increase of duties.
AH Ferrough Boy, the Turkish Minis
ter, said to-day that he probably would

time concerning the American, claims. He
WASHINGTON, April 20.-The House
Committee on Interstate and Foreign
Commerce to-day made an important
change in the Hepburn Nicaragua canal
bill, striking out the provision for the
"fortification" and thus providing what Is
expected to be a compromise which will
aid In bringing the measure to an early
consideration.
The amendment was proposed by Rep
resentative Barham of California. The
chairman of the committee was instruct
ed to offer the same upon consideration
of the bill at the proper time as a com
mittee amendment thereto. The amend
ment was agreed to. not without some ex
pressjon of reluctance, but with a view
to overcoming opposition and securing ac
tion. In its new form the section reads
as follows:
Â»u Be ,, U . Pnacted - etc-, that the President of
the United States be and Is hereby authorized
to acquire from the States of Ccata Rica and
Nicaragua, for and in behalf of the United
btates, control of such portion of the ter
ritory now belonging to Costa Rica and Nica
ragua as may be desirable and necessary on
which to. excavate, construct and protect a
canal of such depth as to enable the move
ment of ships of the greatest tonnage and draft
now in use. from a point near Greytown. on
the Caribbean Sea, via Lake Nicaragua, to
Brito on the Pacific Ocean, and such sum as
may bÂ« necessary to secure such control Is
hereby appropriated out of any money in the
treasury not otherwise appropriated.
Section 2. That when the President has se
cured full control over the territory In the
section referred to he shall direct the Sec
retary of War to excavate and construct a
canal and waterway from the shore of the
Caribbean feea. near Greytown, by way of

sufficient capacity and depth that It may be
used by vessels of the largest tonnage and
greatest depth now in use. and â¢hall be sup
plied with all necessary locks and other ap
pliances to meet the . necessities of vessels
passing from Greytown to Brito; and the Sec
retary of War shall also construct such safe
and commodious harbors at the termini of
said canal, and such provision for defense as
may be necessary for the safety and protec
tion of said canal and harbors.
Early Action on the Bill.
Following the announcement of the
changes In the bill, Hepburn said that it
had been definitely arranged that the
House would take up the canal hill on
May 1 and 2. Although the Committee on
Itules had taken no formal action yet
this appears to be the definite *. under
standing. Hepburn says the passage of
the bill is unquestionable.
The main dissent to the change in the
bill came from Adamson of Georgia, who
desired to have the words "fortify" and
"defend" retained as against any doubt
ful or compromising phrase.
Barham, upon whose motion the
changes were effected, said:
The changes are designed to overcome ob
jections which have been raised, and I have
reason to believe they will accomplish that
end and make the bill generally acceptable.

2The famous author describes his observations while traveling on Num

Tommy Atkinses, who are gathered from all sections of Britain 's vast empire,
fighting against the burghers for their mother country.
(Copyright, 1900, by . Rudyard Kipling.)
All the world over, nursing their scars, . ,
Sit the poor fighting men broke in our wars,
. . ' Sit the poor fighting men. surly and grim,
; Mocking the lilt of the conqueror's hymn.
Dust of the battle o'erwhelmed them and hidâ
Fame never found them for aught that they did.
Wounded and spent, to the lazar they drew.
Lining the road where the legions went through.
Sons of the Laurel, that press to your meed-
Worthy God's pity most ye that succeedâ
Ye that tread triumphing crowned toward the stars,
Pity poor fighting men broke in our wars!
THE sun had faded the red cross on her panels almost to brick color, had
warped her woodwork and blistered her paint. For three months she
had jackaled behind the army, now at Belmont, now at Magersfontein,
now at Rensburg, and in that time had carried over 1300 sick and
wounded.
In her appointments, her doctors, her two nursing sisters and her nineteen
'orderlies there was neither veneer nor pretense, coquetry of uniform nor the
suspicion of official side.
She was starkly set for the work in hand, her gear worn smooth by use and
habit, detailed for certain business only, and to that business most strictly at
tending 1 .
As she started from no known platform I came aboard early, and while we
lay silent as a ship in port, the big stock-pot purring in the kitchen, the bottles
clicking in the pharmacy as the doctor counted them over, I felt that peace had
never been in our generationâ that number three, hospital train, iodoform
scented, washed, scrubbed and scoured, had plied since the beginning of time.
Know now that hospital trains have the right of way over all traffic, and
since their crews feed aboard them need only stop to water and change engines.
We slipped out of Cape Town into the twilight at a steady twenty-five mile
an hour on our 600-mile journey north.
Some day you in England will realize what it means to handle armies and
their supplies over this distance on a single three-foot-six line.
The war has been a war of shunting and sidetracking, of telegraphs and
timetables; so we may hope that the railway men, who have worked like devils,
will not be overlooked when the, decorations come ripe.
.Because the line runs through Cape Colony, and because Cape Colony isâ
we have the highest authority for itâ loyally trying to be "neutral," every
bridge, every culvert, every point at which the line may be cut or blown up
was guarded by a little detachment of armed men.
These are drawn chiefly .from local corps, such as the Duke of Edinburgh's
Own Volunteer Rifles. They, do not like the work; they love still less the "loy
alty" which has made the fatigue necessary.
Said a dust-spotten. begrimed sergeant of the "Duke's" as Number Three,
double-headed, panted up the Hex River Pass into the karroo: "We've been
here since November. I don't mind telling you we're pretty sick of it. We
sit here and patrol the line. Lovely work!"
The setting of the picture hardly varied a hair's breadth.
The single track, lifting and dancing In the heat; the brown, hairless hills
dusted with split stones; the sleek mirage, the knot of khaki figures, the dingy
tents, repeated themselves as though we were running in circles.
Here was a water tank. Number Three drank of it, sucking thirstily; here
was a speckle of ten houses and a refreshment room, which we had no need
to enter; here was a new laid siding, and Number Three flung them all behind
her; but from the men with rifles, the red eyed, bristle bearded, disgusted
truck watchers, there, was no escape.
Suddenly we overhauled a trainload of horses, Bhownagar's and Jamna
gar's gifts to the war; stolid saices and a sowar or two in charge.
"Whence dost thou come?"
"From Bombay, with a Sahib." He looked like a Hyderabad!, buf he had
taken off most of his clothes.
"Dost thou know the name of this land?"
"Dost thou know whither thou goest?"
"What, then, dost thou do?"
"I go with my. Sahib."
Great is the East, serene and Immutable. We left them feeding and water
ing as the order was. ,Â¦'.-Â¦Â¦*Â¦Â¦Â¦ ...
A few miles farther onâ forty or fifty are of no account in this huge place
were guns, infantry and buck wagons, rumbling toward De Aar, and, I think.
New South Wales Lancers. Then a Victorian contingent camped by the way
side, happier than the "Duke's," because they were nearer the front, but wrath
ful in that certain Canadians still farther up the line had the audacity to make
a camp called Maple Leaf.
They wanted news of the Burmah Military Police â long men on little clock
work ponies, recently landed and vanished. Corps have a knack" of disappear
ing bodily in this country.
Of the Burmans I knew nothing, but could furnish Information more or less
Injured by a Saw.

INCESSANT RAINS
IMPEDING TRAFFIC
LONDON. April 21.â The Bloemfonteln
correspondent of the Morning Post, tele
graphing April 19. says: "There Is already
a thirty-foot flood of the Caledon River,
which Is reported to be still rising. All
the drifts on the Modder River are Im
passable. Traffic Is temporarily Inter
rupted southward, the water having
washed the ballast from the line of the
railway. The country about Bloemfon
teln Is so deep in mud that the farmers'
carts are unable to reach the town. We
had a heavy rain last night. To-day the
weather Is Improving, but progress will
be Impossible until the roads are better.
Strenuous efforts are being made to re
arrange the transport to meet the re
quirements of the large army, The task
Is one of considerable difficulty, necessi
tating the transfer of transport animals
and causing consequent sadness to those
who have spent the last five weeks In get
ting their own beasts into condition.
However, there -is no other solution of
the problem possible.
"In view of 'the impending advance
anxiety increases among the troops con
cerning the future of the garrison, at
Bloemfonteln, every one hating the
thought of being left there. There has
been no increase of sickness."

BOER STRENGTH ALONG
THE BIGGARSBERG RANGE
ELANDS LAAGTE, Thursday, April 19.
Yesterday the British patrols discovered
another party of Boers on the British left
In the same position from which the ene
my, recently fired on the South African
Horse. In this Instance, however, there
was no firing.
. Natives confirm recent statements with
respect to the fortifications and strength
of the Boers along the Biggarsberg range.
The enemy have recently established a
large hospital, which is already filled, and
similar hospitals are being established by
them at various railway towns.
The Boers are losing many horses. The
rank and file are not allowed to forage for
supplies. Their sugar Is exhausted and
only bush tea Is available.
The Boers are reported to, wish to leave
the Biggarsberg and take up a' position* at
Majuba, but the commandants refuse.
DESULTORY CANNON
FIRE AND SNIPING
MASERU. Basutoland, April 19â The
Boers continue to move freely around
Wepener, goinjr ; .Jn all directions from
which relief columns are expected. De
sultory cannon fire and sniping have
been going on all day, with scarcely any
reply from Colonel" Dalgety's force.
The Caledon River rose considerably
during the night. This made the Boers
uneasy, as' they fear separation. Some
re-enforcements have arrived for them,
coming apparently from Thaba Nchu,
or in that direction.
Our casualties up to date are believed
to have been" twenty-five killed and 110
wounded.
Owing to the heavy rains and clouds
heliographing has been impossible for the
last two days.
The Boers who lately surrendered in
the Wepener district have been forced
again with violence to fight. Ten of their
leaders have been arrested.
President Steyn has issued orders Â¦" to
the Boer forces to hold tight to the grain
districts of Wepener, Ladybrand anvi
Ficksburg, from which they draw their
food supplies, and also to prevent the
British forces from getting the rich sup
plies now in those districts.
HEAVY BOER LOSS
SUSTAINED AT WEPENER
ALIWAL NORTH, ' April 20.â Captain
Little of Brabant's Horse. Lieutenant Hol
beck and Mr. Milne, a Reuter correspond
ent, fell Into the hands of the enemy while
they were trying to reach Wepener a week
ago. Everything was taken from the pris
oners, who were sent to Pretoria; Their
native servants, who escaped from the
Boer laager, near Wepener. Bay that there
were four guns disabled and that the
Boers had lost 100 in killed alone.
It is also ascertained that the Boers
made a night attack on April 11. but were
discovered while creeping along a deep
ditch by Cape Mounted Rifles with Max
ims, who fired Into them at a distance of
200 yards, with the result that the Boers
lost five wagonloads of killed and wound
ed. Â¦ ' - .<"Â¦â¢'"::â¢.Â¦Â¦->
A simultaneous attack In other quarters
was repulsed by the British, who used
their bayonets.
The Boers still surround Wepener, but
there has been little firing lately.
TROUBLE ON WEST COAST.
LAGOS. British West Africa. April 20.â
Three hundred Nigerian troops have'been
dispatched overland to the Gamaji coun
try northwest of Ashanti, where the Bri-'
tish residents report a recrudescence of
trouble which . necessitated the expedition
of last year. One hundred and fifty other
troops are proceeding from the gold coast.
There ) are .unconfirmed rumors here of
(rouble with the , French at Meko in the
Yeruba country. In the neighborhood of
the Dahomey frontier. Owing to the dis
tance, however, this can hardly be con
nected with the troubles in Ashanti and
Gaman.

FIGHTING RENEWED IN THE FREE STATE.
Special cable to The Call and New York' Her
*!d. Copyright. 1900, by the Herald Pub
lishing Company.
LOXDOX. April 2L-Two important
statements, pointing strongly to the
probability that Lord Roberts' ad
vance to Pretoria has already be
gun, come frcm the field of war.
According to a dispatch from Ladysmith
It is authoritatively reported that the
Boers are retiring from the Biggarsberg
rangÂ© with their heavy ordnance. Prob
ably they have heard of Roberts' ad
vance, and axe naturally anxious to make
sure of their line of retreat; or they may
purpose to take up a more easily de
fended position, allowing part of their
force to be transferred to the army in the
Free State.
"From the movement of the Boers,"
adds the correspondent, "it would ap
pear that General Buller will go forward
simultaneously with Lord Roberts, and
that the forced inaction of the vast army
at Bloemfonteln Is now at an end."
The other fact tending to the same de
duction Is that telegrams from the Or
ange Free State are severely censored,
not a word being allowed to reach the
press respecting the movements of
troops.
Fighting is reported at Karee Siding,
north of Glen, which Is twenty miles or
more from Bloemfontein. The fighting
does not, however, appear to have been
serious, and was probably little more
I than the outposts skirmishing. There
would seem to be at least one division
near Karee Siding, which is the most
northerly point occupied by Roberts'
forces so far as known.
General Cnermside and General Rundle
are moving over the sodden roads. Rain
was still falling when they went Into
camp Thursday afternoon eighteen miles
west of Dewetdorp. They hold the rail
way and the southern frontier of the
Free State with 20.000 .men.
How many are going with the generals
who will engage the Boers at Wepener
is not mentioned in the latest dispatch
from Oorloj^sport. where the British
blxouacked Wednesday night. The field
J telegraph ends there.
| On Thursday the Boers still had
j Colonel Dalgetty closely penned up.
The Government's reason for publish
ing Lord Roberts' Splon Kop dispatch
was explained last evening at Hull by
Walter Hume Long, president of the
Board of Agriculture, who said that the
country was entitled to receive all the
information the Government could give.
"The Government is told." continued
Mr. Long. "that, having published the
dispatches, it Is bound to deal immedi
ately with the g-enerals affected : but.
In following such a course, the Govern
ment might have to dismiss every general
the moment he made a mistake. Had
such a policy been pursued In the past
many glorious deeds would not have
! been performed. The Government uses
its discretion in publishing the dls
| patches. From the beginning of the cam
| paign her Majesty's Ministers have not
} swerved from the rule of leaving ; the
I conduct of operations to the discretion
and Judgment of the commandcr-in
chief."

"Ah!" said Australia, with a rifle, by the water* tank, "wait till you see our
Queensland bushmen. My word! They're something."
Then he expressed a private and unprintable opinion about those arrogant
Canucks up the line, which opinion twisted the other way I got back again
from a Canadian, an Eastern Province man. a few hours later.
Strictly in confidence, I may tell you the colonial corps are riding just the
least little bit In the world jealous. They have each the honor of a new coun
try to uphold, and it is neck and neck between them.
So I sat Joyously on the rear platform while Number Three ran the links
of empire through my hands.
English of the Midlands, Cockney, Scotch. Irish, Welsh, Africa-born,
Queenslander (he had been In the Sunnysido "daur" and "blew" furiously).
Victorian and Canadian â one after another, we picked them up and dropped
them with a flying word.
/ There was nothing wrong with that chain, and by the same token it seemed
to have got hold of something at last, for a truckload of Boer prisoners slid by
in charge of a few disreputable bearded cornets.
"Ho?" said an orderly, critically. "And where did you pick them up?"
"Round Paardeberg. There's more to follow. Most of these is Transvaal
ers -" ' Â¦ -
"That's all right," said the orderly.
The army, you see, is collecting Transvaalers and has come a long way for
samples.
"An' which might be prisoner and which is guard?"
Said the head cornet, with a battered helmet, "I'm a sergeant of the North
amptor.s in charge."
"Oh, you are, are you? Then what are you doin' with Labby's friends?
Take 'em along. Mr. Labouchere won't be pleased at you."
But the sergeant was mightily pleased, save that his prisoners had not
washed tor some time. He said It.
Then we drew to the home of lies, which is De Aarâ a Junction, the pivot
of many of our maneuvers and a telegraph center.
It smelled like Umbala platform in the hot weather, and they kept a hell
there of fifty naked telegraph operators, sweating under* the blazing kerosene
lamps, each man with two pairs of hands and some extra ears.
Outside was thick darkness, and the shunting of trucks â thousands of
trucksâ but the steady boom of the racing instruments beat through all other
noises like the noise of hiving bees.
There was some need to work, and at least one very good reason in the
shape of a big saloon that glided past us in the night, a lit window revealing
just a chair and a neat empty table.
The Sirdar was on the move; going down to Naauwpoort to arrange sur
prises, and it is not at all healthy to be idle when Kitchener passes by.
Therefore, and before this war is over, you will hear all sorts of baseless
tales from a certain type of officer who has been made to work; and you must
not believe them.
After De Aar time-tables ceased.
We were cut adrift on the Sargasso sea of accumulated rolling stock be
tween that place^and Orange River.
Here the rumors begin.
There has been a killingâ a big killingâ the first satisfactory killingâ at
Paardeberg, up the Modder. Roberts held Cronje in a ring of flre, burning day
and night. That was none of our concern.
We had some news that many wounded waited for us at Modder â thirty
officers, at least, and twice as many men â all more or less bad cases.
Here and there one could catch the name of a dead man, and the sister's
lips tightened.
Was So-and-so alive? Well, he was a week ago â some one had seen him.
And Such-another? Oh, Such-another had been buried a week back.
Could Number Three go ahead? Oh, yes: but there was a block at the
Modder. and Kimberley was sending down a trainful.
Number Three whistled madly. Her business was to get up, load and get
away again. Belmont, with the bullet holes through the station name board,
interested her not. nor Graspan either. She had been that road too oftenâ hot
on the heels of the very fight itself. She checked despairingly, fifth in a line
of long trains on the red smear of Modder Plain. The old bridge, wrecked by
the Boers, was now all but repaired.
At present Number Three would go over the trestle, but as to when Number
Three would get across authority could not say, and whistling was Just waste
of steam.
Merciful rain had laid the dust, which normally lies ten inches thick, and
one could look all across the brick red land.
By this time you probably know more about Modder than I; "will have seen
a hundred photographs of the naked, coverless plain that tilts to thÂ« thin line
of trees and the dirty little river; lifting again northward, as a slow wave of
the Atlantic lifts, toward Shooters Hill, where the naval gun played.
North of this again, a bluish lump in the morning light, rises Magersfon
teln.
At that precise moment, but the camp fills and empties as swiftly as the
river, most of our men were out with Roberts nearly thirty miles to the west
ward. Vast empty acreages showed where their accommodations had stood.
Men. horses and wheels had wiped out every trace of herbage, and the dimin
ishing: perspective of their patient single files attested how far afield the camp
oxen must go to graze. Horsemen by twos and threes wandered forth attack
ing interminable distances in which they were swallowed up. Sidings solid
with trucks spurred left and right across the plain, and the trucks on the main
line backed up to the very shoulders of the resetters repairing the bridge.

Respite for Narjot.
The caae of Ernest Narjot, charged with
manslaughter, which has been on trial
before Judge Cook for the past week,
went to the Jury yesterday. After being
out for several hours the Jury reported Â«
that it could not agree on a verdict and
was discharged. The Jury stood eight for
conviction.
to have each political party Insert a plank
in its platform pledging the nominees to
Congress to vote in favor of an exclusion
act to keep the hordes of coolies out of
this country. With this object in view, a
committee of five, consisting of A. West
eby, Charles Schppert, T. H. Arnold, A.
Dijeau and Ed Rosenberg, was appointed,
with instructions to request a like com
mittee from the Building Trades Council
to co-operate with it in calling a mass
meeting at which distinguished labor
union members will discuss the serious
situation.
COOLIE LABOR FLOCKING HERE.
Thousands of Japanese and Chinese
En Route From the Orient.
Some of the Japanese immigrants who
came here *on the. Nippon* Maru from Yo
kohama will not land. That is certain.
Twenty-one of the coolies were found to
be suffering from loathsome and conta
gious diseases by Quarantine Officer Kin
youn and he so reported to United States
Immigration Officer North. That official
at once ordered the Japs deported, and
they will go back to Yokohama. ,on the
Nippon Maru.
The decision of the Immigration officer
raised quite a storm among the import
ers of coolie labor, but that Is about all
AUDITORS RECAPITULATION.
fâ II -Â»HE invasion of this country by the
Japanese has grown to such propor-
II tions as to alarm the laboring classes
of the city, and as a result of last
night's meeting of the Labor Council a
mass-meeting will be held to protest
against the further admission of the
coolies.
It was shown that under the system of
cheap labor as it is known to exist In
Japan there Is no chance for an American
to compete with the imported coolie who
comes to this country under contract to
work for a bare pittance. The system of
Importing these men was fully explained
by several of the speakers, as well as the
coaching that is necessary to evade the
contract and pauper clauses of our pres
ent immigration laws.
The delegates to the Labor Council,
from the bitter experience had with the
Chinese some years ago. are determined
not to be caught by delay on this occa
sion. In order to be on time it was de
cided to hold a mass-meeting at an early
date, and, with such resolutions as may
be adopted at the meeting, put the sev
eral political parties on record as to the
action that is deemed necessary to have
the exclusion act apply to the Japanese,
as well as the renewal of the exclusion
act to Chinese, which will soon expire by
limitation.
It is the Intention of the Labor Council
the good it will do them, as Commissioner
North is determined to send the men back
on the steamer that brought them here.
There are six vessels due to arrive from
Hongkong via Yokohama during the next
four weeks. Giving them the same ratio
as the Nippon Maru. it means that they
will attempt to land at least 1500 Japs and
2000 Chinese in San Francisco before the
month of May is out. *
The Rio de Janeiro Is due here on the
24th inst.. and the Algoa is scheduled to
arrive the following day. The latter ves
sel is a freight boat and may only bring
a few of the coolie laborers. The Coptic
will follow the Algoa on May 4. and the
America Maru on May 12. There are al
ready over 400 Japs booked at Yokohama
for this latter vessel. In view of the
latest developments the chances are that
many of them will not come.
The City of Peking follows the America
Maru on May 19, and the Gaelic will ar
rive May 29. Both these vessels will carry
from 500 to 750 Asiatics, so an estimate of
3500 coolies due to arrive hero during the
next four weeks is a small one.
Down at the Mail dock yesterday the
immigration officials and the customs of
ficers were hard at work examining the
applicants on the Nippon Maru. The ma
jority of the candidates have their lessons
letter perfect, and the chances are that
Collector Jackson and Commissioner
North will land a majority of them.

Bights of Freemen-
SAN FRANCISCO. April 19. l? 00.
To the member, of the People's Party.
e t*te of CaJif orr.ia : Recognizing the right
i r freemen to govern themselves end to
take Into their hands the reins of irovern
raect whenever their tervar.ts prove un
faithful to thfir trust, the Populists of San
Trancisco call Bjjon the members of the
party throughout the Stare to Join tbem
in holding a representative convention of
the People* party in the city of San Fran
cisco ujicn the first day of May. lH"->.
When our party came into being about ten
year* ago the number of its partisans was
small, its principles were rudely declared
and little understood, but those honest pio
neers in the cause of Populism who assisted
at the b'.rth of the party in thi* State went
patiently and earnestly to work ami in four
years organized and built up a strong and
powerful party pledged to secure the God
c:\r-n rights of the common people.
When the campaign of ISM was over and
the result showed that 60. 000â nearly one
quarter of the total vote of the Stateâ had
been polled for our party nominees the
IVople's party became a recocnized and
powerful factor in the politics of this State.
It then became the subject of the most
anxious consideration on the part of the
old partiesâ the Republican party which
wUhed to destroy it, and the Democratic
party which hoped to absorp Its vote.
Bocky Jload to Success.
The road to success In the accomplish
ment of any reform is long and toilsome.
and when the Democratic machine offered
to adopt many of the tenets of Populism as
the price of fusion the prospect of addin*
our vote to theirs and achieving success
quickly in the cause of refiirm was indeed
attractive nn-1 invfting. This cup of Tanta
lus was plured repeatedly fit our lips, and
In attempting to Imbibe its Illusory draught*
we have teen the work of the oarly Populist
pioneers in the good cause nearly undone
and our following dwindle away until our
l*rty has been well nl^ht wrecked and de
stroyed.
Another factor that has entered Into this
rendition very largely has been the charac
ter and the treachery as well as the sordid
felf-interest of those schemers and manipu
lators who for yean? have controlled the
machinery of our party and thereby betn
able to a large degree to dominate its af
faire.
Here in San Francisco, where the prin
ciples of Populism are to a greater or lets
degree believed in by the great ma?s of
the people, the manipulation of the affairs
of the party by a Â»w unworthy men has so
disgusted and Oisheartened the members of
the party that in the late municipal election
a most "p'U fu l showing was made; not be
cause the principles of Populism were any
the less believed in, but simply because the
honest rank ami file of the party repudiated
thew unworthy men. whtÂ» bad almost made
the party name a stigma and a reproach.
Another Great Struggle Pending.
To-day we are again on the eve of another
great national contest and won again v.lll
the republic be in the throes of another
struggle at the old parties for power and
patronage. We see them lining up for the
Iray. thfir voters herded together to swal
]< w' whatever medicir.e the party machine
may offer. K'.ke i-laves they must answer
wVri their masters call. They have noth
irg to say as to who they will vote for. The
corrupt Republican machine brands the
name at McKinley upon the backs of its

slaughter. The afinin* Democratic machine

The Iroquois Club Passes a Resolu-

The Iroquois Club held its regular week

and after a long: discussion decided by a
vote of twenty-five to eleven in favor of

to the State Convention, which will select

tions of the party are being: largely at

ple. It was the disastrous fire of IS7I that

bitter lerson hy actual eaqierlence. will make
the People's party stronger and greater than
ever. When started ten years ago it had
little to co on and there were few people
In the country that believed in Its prin
ciples; to-day thousands upon thousands of
people who have nÂ»ver allied themselves
with the organization believe in all the
fundamentals of Populism, and they elmply
want to see an earnest, active and energetic
movement in the right direction and they
will rally to the support o-f Populism Just
as the people in ISIS and ISCO did to the Re
publican standard when that party, under
the leadership of Lincoln and his compa
triots, was the party of freedom and con-
Etttuticnal liberty.
Talk of Votes Thrown Away.
We are told that If we do not vote for
Bryan we will throw our votes away: and
so it will be four years hence, eight years
hence and at each succeeding- election. Were
the votes cast for the old liberty party of
James O. Barney thrown away? Was the
free soil movement that followed it fruit
less? And. romlr.g down to the present
time, were the votes oast for our party in
ISM), ISS2. and 1594 thrown away? Would
the old parties to-day be compelled to en
grave some of our ideas In their party plat
form if we had not forced their discussion
and educated the people upon them by vot
ing as we did vote? Xot for a moment; a
ballot rightly cast is a vote never lost, and
If we will rid ourselves of political ma
chines, political bosses and the corrupt con
trol of corporations we must use our ballots
with intelligence and judgment, and fol
lowing the dictates of our conscience accept
the result whatever it may be. It Is only
by voting right that we can teacii others
to vote with us; we must destroy the power
of the machine in politics before we can
accomplish any of the great reforms we
seek to attain.
The plutocratic Republican party is anx
ious to see the reform movement destroyed
and every vestige of Populism and of social
ism stamped out and destroyed. The sordid
money barons of the country, selfish capital
istic class that control the Republican
party, to-day hold the destinies of the re
public In the hull of their hand. They all
know that their only hope to continue in
power is to keep the contest narrowed be
tween themselves and the Democratic ma
chine. ,
Republicanism and Democracy.
McKinleyism is no more Republicanism
than Kryanism is Democracy; both are
wrong, the former being hy all odds the
worse of the two. The Republican party
bids fair to destroy in time all the consti
tutional safeguards of human liberty, and
the only hope for the people is to get to
gether an>i organise for the great conflict
that Is yet ta come. The evils of the Mc-
Kinley administration and the excesses of
his monopoly ridden party are now begin
ning to awaken the people to the dangers
ahead: they will grow worse until in the
end they will so shock the consciences of
the people that they will be compelled to rise
in their might and assert their rights. When
that time comes will it be possible to rely
upon the Democratic party to save the re
public? History proves otherwise. It is only
when we achieve the ends of Populism and
socialism through a strong third party or
ganization that there will be any hope of
s-JcceFÃ against the common enemy.
The renditions therefore demand Â¦ prompt
and decisive action. The time is limited.
and we must get our forces together as best
we can. reorganize our party and prepare
once more tv present a united front to the
enemy.

BASEBALL HAS
THE POWER TO
DRAW CROWDS
The National Game Seems to
Lose None of Its At
tractiveness.
The baseball season is well under way
and the public has taken to the sport from
the start. Last Sunday at Recreation
grounds there was an immense crowd
gathered to see the old-time rivals, San
Francisco and Sacramento, meet once
again on the diamond. The score was
close and the quality of ball good. Despite
the fact that Sacramento had Hughes
in the box the local team won out, thus
setting two out of the series of three
games.
With Hughes, Doyle and Salsbury to do
tho twirling tnere is no doubt that the
Senators will have a strong working team.
Neither Doyle nor Hughes pitched win
ning games last week, but tnis is owing
to tne fact that they have not yet roundeo.
into form. What will happen when thes*.
men reach their best speed is to be seen,
balsbury pitched a remarkable game on
the Oakland grounds last Sunday morn
ing, and the public may expect great
things from him before the season is over.
Manager Butler of the Sacramento team
disposed of his interest to Arthur Beebe,
The reason assigned for his withdrawal Is
that his partner wanted Doyle released,
but Butler refused to do so. If this is the
case Doyle may soon be on the market,
ihis Is a chance fyr Harris, who is in saa
need of a twirler ro mate with Iburg.
Tho Stockton and San Francisco teams
are to perform this week at Recreation
Park. As it will be the first meeting of
these clubs the fans will no doubt be out
in force to pass Judgment on the quality
of ball they are capable of presenting In
a contest against each other. The Stock
tons are slightly in the lead, but the eat>
is so small that the two teams are virtu
ally tied. If the local team wins a ma
jority of the series it will change places
with the farmers. After their brilliant
work of last week the homo players have
renewed confidence in themselves and are
prepared to give the men from the Slough
City tho snappiest kind of a contest
The line-up for to-morrow is as follows:
Stockton. Position. San Francisco.

Though the Frlscos succeeded In defeat

the box last Sunday, Manager Harris feels
the Senators have an advantage over his
ngsrregatlon while they have the ex-Na
tional League twirler on their pay roll
and he is intent upon getting a star of
equal magnitude. He has not given up
hope of inducing Bill Lange to don a uni
form, but if he cannot get the stalwart
William he will secure Decker or some
other equally reliable player.

AMONG THE GOLF LOVERS.
The formal season of the San Francisco
Golf Club ended last Saturday with the
Fwerplre victory of the Presidio players
ln the second series of home-and-home
matches between teams representing the
San Francisco and Oakland clubs There
will, however, be a good deal of play on
the links throughout the summer but no
scheduled events. Several of the Presidio
polfers will play at liurllngame, San Ra
fael, Del Monte and other resorts.
A schedule of events for the summer
season Is being prepared by the secretary
of the San Kafael Golf Club, and will be
Ifsur-d shortly. The course is In splendid
condition and will attract many golfers
The club will give at an early date an
open tournament, in which members of
the golf clubs in the environs of San
Francisco may compete. Fortnightly
tournaments will be held throughout the
summer.
It is likely that a golf match will soon
be added to the list of intercollegiate con
tests between representatives of the Uni
versity of California and Stanford Uni
versity. The Machrihanlsh Golf Club at

Two of the important tournaments of
the year for trapshooters will be . held
within the next fortnight. The eighth
annual tournament of the California In
animate Target Association will be held
at Fresno on the .29th and 30th insts. A

after the big tournament at inanimate
targets at Fresno will permit of shooters
so arranging their programme as to at
tend both meetings. Shooting will be
under American -Shooting Association
rules, with the additional provision that
If a shooter discharges both barrels of
his gun at. once .the referee shall order
another bird, whether the bird shot at be
killed or lost. Also that a man breaking
his gun .will be considered to have left
the score as though he had turned away.
He cannot thereafter use a second barrel.
The complete programme follows:
First' day: First eventâ Six birds; entrance
$3, }10 added; high runs to win. Second event
âAmmunition minufacturinp race; ten birds;
entrance $5, $25 added; high runs to win. Third

SAILING CRAFT
The California and Corinthian
Yacht Clubs Open the Sea
son Next Week.
Last Sunday was an ideal day. for sail
ing, there being a good breez6 and smooth
sea. The opening cruise of the San Fran
cisco fleet was made under favorable cir
cumstances. Among the yachts that ac
companied the flagship Ramona over to
the city front and out toward the Heads
were the schooner Lurline, the sloops
Aeolus, Cygnus, Juanlta, Siren, Sappho
and Catherine and the auxiliary schooner
Outing. The yawl Klttlwake with her tan
colored sails was a noticeable object along
tha Sausalito water front last Sunday.
She is owned by Percy Burr, who pur
chased her from George Wellington. Wes
terfeld & Morrow's sloop Aeolus and the
sloop Emille sailed over from Tiburon to
the San Francisco opening last Saturday.
The additions to the Corinthian Yacht
Club house are finished, the contractors
having concluded their work before the
appointed time. The main room has been
considerably lengthened, and now pre
sentÃ an unusually nne appearance. A
most successful opening day is confidently
expected. . ' V- ,"*..'
E. Donohoe has sold the sloop Speedwell
to H. Johns and T. Jennings, who also
own the ark Argonaut. The sloop Queen,
so long owned by Frank A. Bartlett, has
received a coat of dark green paint in
stead of the ordinary copper paint. The
yawl Seven Bells is over at Sausalito.on
Smith's ways, receivine a thorough over
hauling. I. Gutte's schooner Chlspa Is
being prepared for the season at Benlcia,
and E. A. Wiltsee's schooner Aggie has
not been seen at Sausalito since the close
of last season.
To-day the San Francisco fleet will
cruise to Paradise Cove, returning to
morrow. Next Saturday both the Corin
thian and California Yacht Clubs will
open the season with receptions and Jinks.
Owners have been busy with their craft
on Oakland Creek for some weeks past.
The flagship Embla, the sloops Jessie E..
Accident. Pactolus, Thelma, . Surf and
other craft will be ready for the opening
cruise on the following day. The follow
ing-are the committees in charge of the
opening day arrangements: Entertain
mentâJ. Kelly, J. J. Hanlfln, S. Marshal,
L. G Wakeman and ex-Commodore A. M.

lighting and decorationâ Henry de la Mon
tanya. A. C. de Witt and J. J. Grimsey.
Transportationâ A. K. Gibbs.
The California Yacht Club has decided
not to withdraw from the Pacific Inter
club Yacht Association, and the Enclnal
Yacht flub will also stay in the associa
tion for this season at any rate. Both the
yacht clubs of Alameda County feel they
reap little benefit from the association, as
the principal trophy offered by it, the
Macdonough Cup, is for yachts in a class
in which they have no representatives.
Ex-Commodore T. L.. Hill of the San

Ready for tho Ninth Annual
Championship Meeting of
Rival Universities.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. April 20.â
j Final preparations for the ninth annual
| intercollegiate field day between athletes
j of Stanford and the University of Cali
; fornia, which will be held here to-morrow,
have been completed. Stanford's thirty
six athletes, who compose her track
,' team, have done their last hard training
j and await the day on which they will
I struggle for supremacy. While the sup
! porters of the cardinal are not so san
| gulne as to hope for victory, they have
I great confidence in the men who repre
', sent them on field and track and expect
; them to take a creditably large share of
! points from their competitors. The men
I ln whom Stanford places the most con
, lidence are Captain Boyd ln the pole
! vault, Stewart and McCoughran tln
the sprints, Strout and Xaramore in the
{ hurdles. Chadbourne and Hamilton in
; the distances. Symonds and Hopper in the
! broad jump and Parker and Wardall ln
j the weights. When it is considered that
i only five of this year's track team wear
i the college "S," it will be seen that most
!of Stanford's men are untried. While
j good records have been made in practice
; these cannot be taken as a proper crl
l torion of what thry will do when under
I the test of competition.
The following is the order of events:
Trackâ loo-yard heats; SSO-yard run; 120
yard hurdles, trial; 100-yard, final: 440
yard dash; mile walk; 120-yard hurdles,
final; 220-yard dash, heats; "220-yard hur
dles, heats: mile run; 220-yard dash, final;
\ 220-yard hurdles, linal. Fieldâ itJ-pound
hammer throw; high Jump; broad Jump;
pole vault; 16-pound shot put.
Stanford's weakest events are the broad
and high jump and the mile walk and
run. The track has been placed ln ex
cellent shape for the meet and good time
should be- made. Bleachers have been
erected which will accoramoda.tjp 2500 peo
ple. The visitors will have a special train,
Â¦which leaves San Francisco at noon.
TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS.
At the California Tennis Club courts,
Bush and Scott streets, this morning, ten
nis representatives of Stanford and Cali
fornia uni% - ersltles will cross rackets in
the championship meeting of the year.
Contrary to the custom of former years
there will be a single series of matches
to decide which college is entitled to the
honors of the asphalt court.
Each college Is represented by two in
dividual players, who will play singles.
i and one double team. Ttv.j victories will
! carry the palms with them. The singles
will be the best two out of three sets, and
the doubles the best three out of five.
According to the schedule it is arranged
that the singles matches should begin at
S o'clock, the doubles- to follow imme
diately after. The tournament will be
Â¦Â¦ concluded in the morning if this arrange
ment is adhered to.
The University of California will be rep
resented by Sumner Hardy and Harold
Braley in the singles, and Sumner Hardy
and Reuben Hunt in the doubles. Stan
ford will have as Its color-bearers Sam
Hardy and William Roth in singles, and
Sam Hardy and Harry Welhe in doubles.
The two Hardys will meet again, and Bra
ley and Roth.
The last big tournament ln which the
Hardys played was at Del Monte ln Sep
tember, 1599, when the champions of the
East battled with the best of the West.
At that time Sumner Hardy played the
best game of all the Western men. He
outclassed Sam in every match with the
Eastern champions, but since then Sam
has been playing equally as strong a
game as his brother. It will be a ques
tion of chance, ln all probability, who is
to carry off the laurels of this match.
Braley hails from Southern California,
and he also played ln the big tournament
at Del Monte, being linked with another
southern racket-wielder ln the doubles.
He was the surprise of the tournament,
and his heavy smashes and fast play
forced comparisons with "Clcuter" Da
vis the second best of the Eastern visi
tors. Word comes from Berkeley, how
ever, that Braley Is not playing in form.
He has not had much practice since he
entered the college last fall.
The new doubles team, Sam Hardy and
Harry Weihe, stands a fair chance of
winning the prize. Welhe is a strong,
fast player, who has improved steadily
for the last few years. Sumner Hardy
and his partner. Hunt, have played to
gether for some time.
In the afternoon, on the same courts,
the California Club will hold a doubles
tournament for the Davis cups. All the
regular club teams will compete. The
Whitney brothers have won the cups
twice, but it is necessary to take them
five times before they become absolute
property. The drawings will take place
at the courts.

Six Barges Will Enter Junior
Race on Olympic Ladies'
Day.
The "moonlight picnic" of the Alameda
Boating Club given last Saturday night on.
Oakland Creek was so pretty a spectacle
and so successful an entertainment that it
will probably be repeated on a more ambi
tious scale within the next two or three
months. Seventeen craft of various kinds,
decorated with lighted lanterns, were
towed down the creek to the accompani
ment of music, which wag heard far away
ln the stillness of the calm night.
The â¢"Ladies' Day " to be given by the
members of the Olympic Boat Club at Ti
buron ha* grown into a bigger and more
Important affair than was at first con
templated. Originally the only event open
to general competition was the outrigger
ckilf race between Stanley Adderley and
George Baker. Now a junior barge race,
a. Junior .^kiff event and a handicap race,
open to craft of ail kinds and of any
ciub, are talked of. besides a water polo
tournament and swimming races. The
rt-gatta committee of the Pacific Associa
tion of the Amateur Athletic Union is
taking the event In har.d. It is probable
the junior barge race will attract a large i
number of entries, as the Alamedas. I
Ariels. Dolphins and Pioneers have crews |

The Olympic Boat Club has sixteen or
more men In training, and the Junior barge \
crew will be selected from these. Two |

ANGLERS ARE
PLANNING FOR
FUTURE SPORT
Await With Impatience the
Opening of the BJg Streams
of the State.
The anglers who make annual pilgrim
ages to the Important trout streams of.
the State are already planning their trips.
They are Impatiently awaiting the time
when they can leave for haunts about
which cluster pleasant associations of
other years and other outings. From
v erdl come reports that fishing la improv
ing, the trout taking the fly readily. If
weather conditions continue favorable
good sport should be enjoyed ln tha
Truckee near there.
Advices received from the United States
fish hatchery at Balrd. on the IlcCloud
; ve^'i a 5? to the effe Â« that after ten days
of cold, disagreeable weather the tempera
ture has gone up and conditions for fish
ing are greatly Improved. Anglers who
purpose visiting: the McCloud will find
that the Oregon express, upon which they
formerly traveled to the fishing ground
does not stop at Balrd Spur. Anglers must
now leave Uie train at Redding, twenty
miles from Balrd. and drive over to their
destination. The former stopping placo
entailed a. drive of only elev<<n miles to
the hatchery. The new arrangement la
brought about through the train running
on a faster schedule and making but few
stops.
A party made up of such well-known
anglers as A. S. Carmany, Edward Ev
erett. Walter Carr and George Morse will
leave early next week for the ilcCloud
for a brief spell at the fishing.

A writer ln Outing offers the following
suggestions as to suitable clothing foi
fishermen:
The proper sarb for early trout fishing Is
heavy all-wool underwear and socks, with
'dead prass" canvas or duck coat and trou
sers. The hat should be an old drab or rcray
felt, to which the flies may be easily affixed
If necessary. Corduroy for outer jrarments
Is undesirable, because It Is almost certain
to get more or less wet. and It dries slowly
The best thlnjrs for the feet are the regular
tan-colored waders. Such a costume la In
conspicuous against the ordinary surround
ings of trout streams and this point is im
portant. Avoid all flashy trimmlnsrs on a
rod, and move as slowly and cautiously m
you would If trailing a deer. The observ
ance of these hints, on much-fished waters,
will help to fill the creel.

THE BREED OF
GREYHOUNDS
Coursing Men Are Importing
the Best Strains of English
Blood.
The most notable importation of grey
hounds ever made by a California cours
ing man is expected next week from Eng
land. There are six of the breed In all,
four being saplings, while two are twen
ty-two months old. They were purchased
in England by J. H. Rosseter of this city,
his intention being to infuse new blood In
to the greyhounds of this coast. There
has been so much in-breedlng during re
cent years that deterioration of the stock
was sure to result In time. The gTey
hounds selected by Mr. Rosseter are all
direct descendants of Waterloo cup win
ners, and the best blood courses through
their veins.
One of the saplings Is by Peregrine
Pickle, out of Sussex Belle. The sire was
twice runner-up for the Waterloo cup.
Two others are by Fortune Favente, out
of Rognure, she by Restorer. Rognure
Is the only greyhound that ever led
Wild Night, a Waterloo winner, to the
hare. A dog sapling Is by Gallant, also
a Waterloo winner, out of Jeanne Mil
burn. The latter is out of Mullingar, the
dam of many famous performers. The
two puppies are by First Fortune-Moth
er's Choice. They are called Fortunate
Choice and My Selection. The former ran
once and divided the Fairfort stake, while
the latter divided the maiden stake at
Cirencester, England. The four saplings
are untried.
They will be sold at auction at Union
Park the Sunday after their arrival. The
only limit placed upon them is that they
will be sold for at least their cost landed
here. Mr. Rosseter agrees to give the
services of For Freedom and Emln Pasha
for two puppies out any litter they sire.
The coursing at Union Park will com
mence to-day upon the arrival of the
11:45 a. m. train. The stake was limited to
ninety-six entries. Among these are Fine
Fire, Robert Malcom's new English doy
and one of the finest looking ever seen
here. He is not at his best yet, the cli
mate still having him in its grasp. Luxor
Is also among the entries, of which the
majority are the pick of the local ken
nels.
The choice bit of the Ingleslde pro
gramme to-morrow will be the match be
tween Lowe & Thompson's Flora McDon
ald and James Dean's Connemara, the
hero of many champion stakes. Flora
McDonald showed a shade more speed
last Sunday than her opponent, but he is
the cleverer worker if once placed on a
hare. In addition to this there will be
an eighty-dog open stake. The sport will
commence to-day at 12 o'clock and to
morrow at 1L
Dr. Clark's Kerry Gow, formerly owned
by M. Michalek, died on the plains near
Stockton some days since. His owner had
a match on with the greyhound Nonpareil
and wanted to try cut his dog. The fit
ter started up a strong hare and ran nine
minutes before he could be retaken.
E. M. Kellogg has bought from M. Law
lor a 12-months-old sapling by Ben Bolt-
Mona.
Will Thompson expects a consignment
of eight greyhounds next week from his.
partner, Mr. Lowe of Kansas. He hopes
to find a few Flora McDonalds among:
them.

field, is due in this city next week.
The next important fixture in the cours
ing calendar will be the ladles' day cham
pion stake to be decided at Union Park
June 16 and 17. The stake Is run under the
patronage of the Interstate Coursing 1
Club, being one of the fixtures of that as
sociation. The park management has

RUSSIAN DESIGNS ON KOREA.
DESPITE the recent statement of Count Cas
sini, Russian Embassador at Washington, that
Russia has no designs of aggression on
Korea, nor any intention of violating her agreement
with Japan concerning that country, it appears the
Japanese Government is by no means satisfied with
the situation. All reports from Yokohama are to the
effect that Russian assurances are not trusted by the
officials of Japan, and that there is a serious menace
of war between the two powers.
The Russian Government is seeking to attain its
ends in Korea by the employment of tactics which
have just proven so successful in Persia. They are
offering the Korean Government a loan of something
like $12,000,000, and, according to the reports, are
forcing it upon the country, for it seems the Koreans
are by no means desirous of becoming the debtors of
so powerful a creditor,' nor of giving the guarantee
the Russians demand.
The practice'of financing a weak nation for the pur
pose of getting an excuse for suppressing its inde
pendence has now become one of the favorite meth
ods of imperial diplomacy. It will be remembered
that Great Britain obtained her hold oi Egypt by act
ing as collector of a loan. Furthermore, when, after
the war with Japan, the Chinese Government sought
to obtain money with which to pay the indemnity de
manded by the victors, the British were eager to ad
vance it. An arrangement was actually made for
financing the Chinese loan in London, but the Rus
sian Government intervened and by a protest, backed
by threats against China, compelled that Government
to recede from its bargain. The Russians then in
kindness of heart offered to furnish China with the
money, but British influence in turn compelled the
rejection of the proffer. Finally the desired funds
were obtained through the aid of a German bank,
and the controversy closed.

GOVERNORS ON ARID LANDS.
AT a conference held in Salt Lake City by Gov
ernors or their proxies of States included in
the arid region it was resolved to oppose the
leasing of the grazing lands, but to demand the ces
sion of all -the public domain to the States. It does
not seem to have occurred to the Governors and their
proxies that such wholesale cession is a far wider de
parture from the practice of the Federal Government
than the leasing policy which they oppose. Nor did
it occur to them that leasing the lands now, to pre
serve their forage and conserve the water supply, does
not at all interfere with their ultimate cession to the
States, but preserves* the sole value that they have
for the States or the people. The practice of the peo
ple of this country is the reverse of the cession of
lands to the States. The ordinance of 1787 accepted
the cession of the Northwest Territory by Virginia to
the Federal Government. The land became public,
Federal 1 domain, and five States were finally carved
out of it. From the beginning the principle has been
adhered to, that the ownership of the public domain
is in the whole people of the Union, until the Federal
Government patents it into private ownership. There
is no prospect that this policy will ever be changed.
The Governors and their proxies adopted a resolu
tion to "favor a cession of the said arid lands to the
several States wherein they are situated, under such
terms and conditions as will guarantee the
benefits of the free homestead laws to the
people of the United States, and will prevent said
lands, either by fee simple title or by the leasing
I thereof, from passing into the possession or control
of large companies, syndicates, corporations or
wealthy individuals in large quantities, to the exclu
sion of others, and under such conditions that the
: several States may have the income arising from said
j lands,,to be devoted to the reclamation thereof for set
i tlement by bona fide citizens."
The Governors intend by this to stigmatize the
Federal leasing system as in the interests of corpora
tions, syndicates and wealthy people, to the exclu
sion of others, which is absolutely untrue. But it is
evident that the Governors intend to lease the lands
if ceded to the States, for they say they want the "in
come arising from said lands" to reclaim and improve
them for actual settlers. If the ranges continue to be
used in common, as now, there will be no income:
and if they are subject to free homestead entry. as
under any system they should be, their transfer to
private ownership will produce no income for the
State.
Therefore the income they must yield, in order to
fit them for the private ownership of the actual set
tler, must come from leasing their use to stock men.
But the Governors and their proxies pledge them
selves to not lease them to companies, corporations,
syndicates nor wealthy individuals. This makes
necessary a condition in the State lease pledging the
leaseholder not to become wealthy out of grazing his
flocks and herds on his leaseholds, for that will dis
qualify him as a leaseholder.
If getting rich by the use of land is an offense pun
ishable by exclusion from such use, the Governors
and their proxies can logically draw no line between
the leaseholder and the freeholder. To be logical they
must insert in every State patent to a homesteader a
condition that he is to remain poor on his freehold,
under penalty of vitiation of his title.
If rich leaseholders are an abomination, they can
be abolished by taking away their leases. They arc
therefore an impermanent abomination and a fleeting
show. But the Governors will have the rich free
holder always with them as a chronic abomination
unless they condition his patent upon permanent iri
digence.
Several of the States represented by the Governors
have had large grants of public lands, in lieu of the
school sections lost in Indian reservations, and for
other purposes. In many cases these lands have been
leased in large tracts to exactly the same classes they
stigmatize, and also by the same Governors who do
the stigmatizing. Nor is the homesteader and bona
fide settler any bar to the acquisition of land by syn
dicates or others in large tracts, but is rather a con
venience thereto. The "Big Four," the Chicago meat
packers, have leased and acquired in the States repre
sented by these Governors, of State land, an area
nearly as large as Kansas, and are stocking it with
sheep. Swift, one of the packing combine, is buying
from the actual settlers to whom it was patented the
Camas prairie in Idaho, a tract about forty miles long
by twenty-five miles wide, and the settlers are pocket
ing their coin and raising their voices in favor of the
Governors' policy of State cession and actual settle
ment to prevent the wealthy getting land!
Conclusive Charges.
Vlsalia Times
The" Call is authority for the statement
that Federal officials are letting Chinese
land in violation of the exclusion act. As
the proprietor of The Call Is the National
Committeeman of the Republican party
for California, and the men he condemns
are Republicans, It Is fair to assume that
the evidence to support tho charges must
be pretty/conclusive.
When a delegation from Frederick, Md., was be
fore a Senate committee asking for $200,000 of war
damages, one of the delegates told Senator Depew
that the story of Barbara Freitchie is not a myth,
whereupon the New York statesman told the com T
mittee that Barbara had been one of the idols of his
childhood, and that when he played around his
mother's knee his heart throbbed with sympathy for
the old woman who had so nobly defied the foes of
her country. The display of Depew emotion was ex
tremely effective until some one asked him if he
thought the incident occurred in the wÂ»r of 1812, and
r4minded him that he must have been about thirty
five years old when it occurred. As a freak of mem
ory that is hard to beat, but then Depew never was
able to determine exactly where his memory ends and
his imagination begins.
Uncle Sam appears to be in an extremely unfortu
nate predicament in his effort to force the Sultan of
Turkey to pay damages for certain depredations. The
Sultan has no money and can't fight. Uncle Sam
won't fight and can't collect. He ought to employ a
bad debt collector like John Bull. :
The Chinese Government has issued an imperial
edict guaranteeing protection to native Christians. If
the Government Would follow this order by another
keeping its "native sons" in the empire. Californians
would have legitimate ground for celebration.
If the smashing of idols continues we won't have
left a single hero of the Spanish war. Even "Teddy"
Roosevelt is now accused of being a quitter.
What England Pays for War Horses.
It Is difficult to estimate the enormous
expenses incurred by the English Gov
ernment for the transportation to South
Africa of necessary war material, and
especially so with respect to the horses
needed.
A Budapest newspaper, styled the
Sport and Hunting Journal, has calcu
lated the cost to the English for sending
to the Cape 3000 horses that the British
Military Commission has Just bought in
Hungary.
The average price of these horses was
$160. They will bo embarked at Flume
in the horse-steamer Mont-Liban, es
pecially arranged for the purpose, and
shipped direct to Durban. The voyage
will take from thirty-nve to forty days.
The cost price alone of the horses
amounts to $480,000. Add to this the ex
pense of transportation, custody and
food as far as Fiume, amounting to about
JGO.OOO. The expenses during the sea voy
age as far as Durban, including the
maintenance of the animals, pasturage
purchased at calling stations, etc.. ag
gregate $955,400. Adding all these charges
you have a total that Indicates that
every horse arriving in Durban has cost
England nearly $3000.
In France and Italy it is believed that
the maiden who buries a drop of her blood
under a rosebush will be rewarded with
rose-tinted cheeks.

CONCERT BY THE
RUSSIAN ARTISTS
Messieurs 'Petschnlkoff and Hambourg
played to an enlarged audience yesterday
afternoon at what was to have been their
final concert. It is announced that they
will be heard here again next Friday af
ternoon at 3:15 o'clock.
The increased attendance is the best
possible proof that these artists are being
appreciated at something like their true
value. Â¦ .
Just what that value is cannot be esti
mated at this early stage of their career,
but I feel no reluctance in prophesying
that the name of Petschnikofr is destined
to become enrolled with those of the
greatest masters of the violin. His play
ing is so sane and sincere and withal so
diamond-like in its purity, clearness
and brilliance; it is delicate and
Ftrong; ethereal and passionateâ ln it
are combined accuracy and individualism
and a consummate technical facility that
compels amazement.
The programme yesterday was well se
lected and showed not only the rare
charm of the young violinist but displayed
the planistic powers of Mr. Hambourg
as well. Such fantastic compositions as
an intermezzo in octaves by ueschittsky,
a "Gavotte Moderne" by Hambourg him
self and Liszt's extravagances ! on the
Mendelssohn wedding march gave the
player ample opportunity to astound his
hearers, which he certainly did; but how
much of the esthetic essence of music his
wonder-working fingers created is another
question.

prodigy. PORTER GARNETT.

A WORD ON NATIONAL POLICY.
THE Chronicle attacks the Republican members
of Congress from this State for pledge-breaking
because they voted for the Porto Rican bill, it
quotes a plank in our State platform for 1898, pledg
ing these members to extend our revenue system to
Porto Rico and the Philippines. That platform was
made on August .24. 1898, before we had either Porto
Rico or the Philippines. Suppose that the treaty of
Paris had been different in its terms, and we had taken
none of these islands, would the Chronicle insist that
the piedge of our members would require them to ex
tend free trade to both?
Many questions, now plainly seen to be involved,
a ere not in sight at that time. A State platform can
not n:a.ke a national policy. That must be the work
of the whole party, of all the States, represented in
Congress or by delegates in a national convention.
The Republican platform of this State in 1896 was dis
tinctly for free silver. Will the Chronicle contend
that that makes a pledge-breaker of even- one of our
Congressmen who voted for the gold standard? It
rray ma!:? one contention just as well as the other.
The party in Congress, upon a larger and more in
timate view of the situation, decided upon the Porto
Rican bill as the present proper treatment of the is
sue. It became a party and caucus measure. Would
the Chronicle have had our members bolt and join
the free trade Democracy?
The Chronicle now demands that our members
declare that they will in the future "promote complete
freedom of intercourse between all parts of the
American Union," and upon those terms it will con
sent to forgive and take them back into its confidence.
This raises a question of the Chronicle's position.
Does it consider Porto Rico and the Philippines part
of the American Union? Does it agree with Mr.
Bryan a*jd the chairman of his National Committee
that "the treaty of Paris extended the whole constitu
tion, with all its privileges, immunities and blessings,
over Porto Rico and the Philippines"?
The same Senate which ratified the Paris treaty
and immediately after that act passed a resolution
vieclaring that it was not the intention of this Govern
ment to make the Philippine Islands an integral part
of this Union. The President himself stands in denial
of the proposition that they are now a part of the
Union and under the whole constitution. All of these
things go to absolutely nullify the free trade pledge
of the California platform of 1808. If these islands
rre part of the Union, and wholly under the constitu
tion, these people. Asiatic coolies and all, are citizens
of the United States, free commoners everywhere
within our borders, and voters in any State wherein
they have fulfilled its residence qualifications. That is
the end to which the Chronicle's position leads us.
We deny its premise. We uphold the Republican
position that these islands are not a part of the Union,
under the constitution. That position has, to back it.
the opinions of the Supreme Court, and of Jefferson,
the younger Adams, Jackson and Webster, all being
agreed that Congress has exclusive power to legislate
over the Territories and any acquisitions.
In the treaties with France, Spain and Mexico, by
which we acquired territory, we stipulated that the
subjects or citizens of those countries, resident
therein, became citizens of the United States, at their
or.tion. If the constitution followed the flag it car
ried citizenship to such residents, and the treaty
stipulation was unnecessary. That it had place in the
treaties was an acknowledgment by Jefferson. Mon
roe and Polk, respectively, that the constitution fol
lows neither the sword nor the flag. Those Presidents
were all Democrats.
The treaty of Paris rests on their interpretation of
the constitution. It omits to make citizens of the
j-fople of Porto Rico and the Philippines, but leaves
their civil status to be settled by Congress. We think
that the Chronicle will hardly insist that the consti
tution by its own vigor extends over them in all re
spects but this one, for the establishment of such a
doctrine will be found impossible. It is plain, there
fore, by constitutional construction and by precedent,
that neither those islands nor their people are in the
American Union, with all the privileges and immuni
ties and civil status conferred by the constitution. If
'hey were, it would be their misfortune and our
calamity. Conventions may resolve that we will re
tain them in perpetuity, but that declaration does
nothing to fix their status. That remains just where
the constitutional construction and acts of Jeffer-
Fon, Monroe and Polk leave it. subject to the will of
Cop press.
If the Chronicle choose to advocate the policy rf
Congress hastening to give them the full status of the
constitution, and admitting the soil to the Union and
the people to citizenship, that is a proper issue. Its
contention that this has already been done has not
a leg to stand on.
TELEPHONE EXTORTIONS
WHEN the McCarthy resolution requiring tele
phone companies to supply the patrons of the
telephone slot machines with the desired
switch before exacting payment comes up for re
consideration on Monday it should have the unani
mous support of the board. Those who voted against
it last Monday because they thought the subject had
not been sufficiently investigated by next Monday will
have had ample time to acquire all desired informa
tion. The issue is one of plain justice to the public,
and there is nothing in the resolution which can be
in any sense rightly construed as a wrong to the
company.
The aggressions of the telephone monopoly are be
coming more and more unbearable. It will be re
membered that when a proposition was made to im
pose upon the company a fair degree of taxation
one of its officers mockingly asserted that if the tax
were imposed the company would "put it in the bill"
and exact it from its patrons. Furthermore, it is to
be recalled that when the new charter was being
framed the company, by its astute attorney, cleverly
tricked the charter-makers into so framing the instru
ment as to exempt telephone companies from the
municipal supervision exercised over all other cor
porations controlling and operating public utilities.
These are specimens of the aggressions and eva
sions practiced by the company upon the public in the
way of tax-shirking and extortion, but it has other
ways of offending against public welfare. A com
plaint made by A. Aronson in an action against the
Pacific Telephone Company reveals another example
of the monopoly methods. It appears the company
desired to fasten its wires to Aronson's building, but
was not willing to grant any remuneration for the
privilege. Being refused the privilege the company
undertook to enforce it by bringing pressure to bear
upon the tenants of the building. A portion of the
building is occupied as a hotel, and it is alleged that
the telephone company, through its agents, ap
proached the proprietor and threatened that unless
she would prevail upon Aronson to grant the privilege
desired by the company the telephones would be re
moved from her hotel, and the three employes of the
company living at the hotel would leave her house
or else lose their positions. A physician rented
apartments in 'the hotel and was about to occupy
them. He ordered a telephone placed in the rooms,
but was informed that the. company declined to place
any telephones in that building, and the prospective
tenant was obliged to seek accommodation elsewhere.
The Gas Consumers' Association, occupying one of
the stores beneath the hotel, was notified to remove
the eleven regulators it had rented to the telephone
company. When asked for the reason for the sud
den change the company's officer said that they were
not needed, as the company did not burn gas. The
Gas Consumers' Association investigated and found
that the statement was not true, and complained to
Aronson that his action toward the company had
deprived his tenant of patronage. T. Brilliant and
Bush & Mallett, tenants of Aronson, were also noti
fied that their telephones would be removed.
That instance of attempted extortion on the part of
the telephone company is cited only because it is of
recent occurrence and is now before the courts. It
serves as a timely illustration of the aggressiveness of
the company. The abuse of exacting money from the
patrons of telephone nickel-in-the-slot-machines ?s
one of long standing and constitutes virtually a sys
tem of petty larceny practiced upon the public. It is
a wrong for which there is not one plea of justifica
tion to be urged. The McCarthy resolution does not
in any way even suggest retaliation for the many
wrongs, /ifTenses, exactions and extortions practiced
by the telephone companies in other ways. It aims
simply at the prohibition of that particular form of
fraud, and it is therefore the duty of the Supervisors
to enact it into law.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 21, 1900.
in South Africa it is safe to say the Russians would
never have succeeded in making their recent loan to
Persia, and it is probably due to the sanie war that
they are now so persistent in their efforts to. arrange
a -Korean loan. The British are not in a position to
protest with any great force,* and the only obstacle
in the way of Russian extension is Japan.
The Korean peninsula is a region of high commer
cial and strategic importance in that part of the world.
The extension of the Russian railways to the Pacific
Ocean renders Korea extremely valuable to the em
pire. It would be in many respects a more important
acquisition than Persia,. for while the control of the
Persian ports gives Russia an opening on the Indian
Ocean, the annexation of Korea would give the em
pire a dominating influence over all of Northern
Asia and make the eventual conquest of a large part
of China a comparatively easy task.
It is said at this time all that Russia asks is the
concession of a small amount of territory in Korea
or the island of Kokotu. These may appear small,
but the possession of either of them would bring a
powerful enemy close to the coasts of Japan. For
that reason the Japanese Government is watching the
progress of events with no little suspicion. It is clear
that if there is to be war, the sooner it begins the
better will it be for Japan. If the conflict be post
poned until the Siberian railroad is completed and
the Russians have established a single foothold in
Korea, the advantages Japan now possess will be lost.
Wars are too costly to be undertaken in these days
without grave reasons, and the crisis may pass in
peace, but there can be no doubt the danger of a
conflict is imminent

Ferry Steamer Bay City in
Collision With Scow
Freemont. â¢ '
J". P. O'Brien Tries to Commit Suicide
/ ;; From the Deck of the Oakland,
but Is Prevented by Sec
ond Mate Scott.
Â»
There was trouble on two of the ferry
steamers yesterday, j One of them was in
collision with a schooner and had a hole
punched In her side, while the crew of
the other had a struggle with a would-be
suicide.
The Bay City was on her way from
Oakland on the 12:45 p. m. trip when she
met the bay schooner Freemont. The
latter had the right of way, but luffed up
in order to allow the ferryboat to pass.
Without any warning the schooner was
put on her course again, and before the
steamer could be stopped the two came
together. The Fretmont's bowsprit stove
a hole in the Bay City's side, while her
running rigging tore away four of the
steamer's braces. The schooner's bow
sprit was carried away during the en
counter and her starboard railing was
stove in. She had to come to an anchor
in order to prevent drifting down on the
battleship lowa, but the Bay City made
her slip without any further mishap.
It waa blowing fresh at the time of tj\e
mishap and very few of the Bay City's
passengers were on the upper deck, so the
vessels had come together and separated
almost before any of them knew of the
accident.
A man named J. F. O'Brien, who gave
his address as .1033 Green street, made a
desperate attempt to jump overboard
from the steamer Oakland. During the
afternoon he put in an appearance at the
ferries and told Officer Campion that he
was going to commit suicide. "My life
has been one long light against adverse
circumstances," said he, "and now I am
going to end it all." Campion kept watch
on O'Brien, and when he boarded the
Oakland told Second Mate Scott to keep
watch on him. When the ferryboat was
nearing Goat Island O'Brien got Into a
dark corner and began taking off his
clothes. Second Mate Scott then locked
him up and turned him loose when the
steamer got back to San Francisco. By
that time O'Brien had changed his mind
and promised to go home and not again
attempt to end his life.
Strike on the Madrono.
The sailors on the lighthouse tender
Madrono quit the ship in a body yester
day. The Government has cut their wages
from $40 a month to $35, and the men as
sert that they can do better than that on
coasting vessels, so they walked out. The
Madrono returned from a cruise a few
days ago and went to Goat Island. Shortly
after she was lied up the men were noti
fied of the cut in wages. They said noth
ing until the tender came to the Â«eawall
yesterday, and then they quit in. a body.
Men are very scarce on the beach just
now, and the chances are that Uncle Sam
will have to do as he did in the case of
the revenue cutter Bearâ go back to the
old rate of wages.
Run Down by a Hack. '
Fred J. Williams, who la employed In
the news-stand at the ferry depot, waa
run down by a hack yesterday and had
his right leg broken, besides receiving
other injuries. Williams, accompanied by
his little daughter, was boardinga car at
the ferries. A hack driven by T. J. Bell
came along at a good rate of speed and
before Williams could get out of the way
knocked him down and went over him.
The driver was arrested by Officer Cam
pion and locked up on a charge of battery,
while Williams was taken to the Harbor
Hospital, where Dr. Putnam set his
broken limb.
Water Front Notes,
The transport Aztec arrived from Ma
nila after a passage of 43 days, via Naga
saki 27 days: Hail the Aztec been run
ning- for the Mail Company she would
have made the run from Nagasaki in
Rbout 17 days acd the entire run in less
than 30 days. But as she Is under charter
to the Government at $300 per day there
was no necessity for hurry. The Aztec
took a load of mules from here to Manila
and comes back in ballast. The voyage
was an uneventful one.
The steamer Westminster has been re
chartered by Government and will
take a load of commissariat stores and
hay to Manila. '
The hospital ship Missouri will dock as
soon as the transport Warren goes to
Hunters Point. All her hospital stores
will be removed, and it now seems more
than probable that she will be turned into
a freight boat.
The steamer Manauense Is still in quar
antine. She made the run from Mahukona
in the good time of nine days, bringing
up 22,000 bags of sugar. She will return
to the islands as soon as she discharges,
carrying passengers and general cargo to
Kahulul.

GRAND JURY INDICTS
SCHOOL BOARD RING
Swift, Burns and O'Brien to Again Be
Brought to Trial for Alleged
Swindles.
The Grand Jury yesterday filed an In
dictment In Judg-e Bahrs* court against
Edward D. Swift for felony In obtaining
money by false pretenses under the firm
name of Swift & Co. The indictment re
cites that Swift by false and fraudulent
representations obtained possession of
goods and money of the city and county
in the sum of JKI 92^; that he falsely
pretended to have delivered to the Board
of Education on June 18. 1597, and on other
dates, 295.750 fancy shingles at |1 90 per
thousand, whereas he did not deliver the
shingles at all. though he was paid the
sum stated by the city ffcr so doing.
Indictments were also returned against
Thomas A. Burns and John J. O'Brien
for defrauding the city and county out of
$SllO. Burns Was a member of the School
Board and O'Brien Inspector of Buildings
when the alleged frauds were perpetrate
and it is charged that they were in col
lusion with Swift. The cases against the
accused were brought to trial recently
but they escaped on a technicality.
Bail was fixed at $2500 for Swift and $2000
each for Burns and O'Brien.
The Grand Jury also considered the
complaint of Mitchell Ackenhell, at Sut
ter-street car conductor, who accuses Na
gel & Mitchell of defrauding him out of
$114. The firm acted as his attorneys in
a suit against the road for damages, and
Ackenheil claims that they Induced him
to pay the money for court fees. They
then had him sign an agreement purport
ing to give them one-fourth of all they
recovered, when. In fact, it was a surren
der of the $114, of which he was Ignorant,
because he cannot read English.

There is no strength and ambition to work when the
nerves and body are weak or diseased. Paine's Celery
Compound sustains the strength of the nerves and of the
stomach, liver and kidneys.
REV. FRED PFEIFFER, SEDALIA, MO., Writes:
"My nervous system was entirely broken down by overwork. I could not eat nor
sleep. For four months I was in the hospital, but without any decided benefit. At last
I purchased a bottle of Paine's Celery Compound, and soon felt its wonderful curative
effects. Four bottles of the Compound restored me to health and strength; I am now
ambitious to work, have a good appetite and sleep well."
CIVIL SERVICE
ENLARGES ITS
FIELD OF WORK
Operating as a Free Employ
ment Bureau for Those
Who Need Help.
Profession nJ and Business Men ' Wan
ting Clerks and Laborers Now
Draw From Eligible List
cf Candidates.
*
The municipal Civil Service Commission
of this city has found itself In a new
field of usefulness not contemplated by
the r.ew charter. It has unintentionally
become a free employment feureau. Quite
a number of merchants, brokers, lawyers
and others having use for help In their
respective lines have successfully applied
to the commission for the desired mate
rial.
So far the commissioners have only
made examinations in a limited number of
classes. After the municipal departments
were filled with the successful applicants
a larere number of copyists, stenographers,
typewriters, bookkeepers. clerks, etc..
were placed on the "eligible list." Busi
ness and professional men were not long
:a flr.dirÃ- that in tsis list were people who
could do good work In other than city
service.
Applications have been made to the
commission by many business firms tor
competent help. J. R. Freud, president of
the commission, stated yesteraay that all
applicants for city positions must fur
nish credentials of good character, trust
worthiness, etc.. and the commission as
certains their ability at the examination.
The ii.<t of t-iigibles will always be larger
than the municipal requirements and not
a few wouM be glad to accept employ
ment In private pursuits rather than to
wait for a place in the city government.
As the examinations progress and the
commissioners pass upon the merits of
candidates for places as draughtsmen,
janitors, teamsters, engineers, tinners.
carrÂ»-ntÂ»rs and other branches of indus
try. Mr. Freud is of the opinion that there
will be larpe lists of excellent workmen In
excess of ihÂ» city's requirements.
Judging from the number of applications
already made to the commission and the
possibilities when the field is enlarged,
Mr. Freud believes that the commission
will be the means of filling many positions
In private life to the satisfaction of em
ployer and employed.
TRANSACTIONS IN REALTY.
Â«'-Â» -HE past week has been rather quiet
j so far as actual sales of realty are
J^ concerned. Dealers say that the in
terest Is growing In retail business
properties. The most Important event of
the week perhaps was the announcement
of the acceptance of the plans for the con
struction of a ten-story building on Mar
ket street, near the gore formed by
Geary, Market and Kearny streets, for the
Mutual Savings Bank, to cost from $230,
000 to $300,000. Considerable progress has
been made in tearing down the old-time
buildings on the northeast corner of Cali
fornia and Montgomery streets to clear
the ground for the eleven-story building
to be erected for Alvinza Hayward. The
elte for the erection of the fine new Cal
laghan estate building at Market and
McAllister Is also practically cleared of
old shacks. '
It is an uncommon thing to see three big
buildings In course of erection at one time
in this city, and the spectacle will be
taken as a substantial evidence of pros
; perity.
The large business block on the south
: east corner of California and Front streets
1 will soon have two stories added to it and
I will also be provided with two elevators
and otherwise improved by the owners.
; This Is In the heart of the downtown
I wholesale section.
The Real Estate Record published by
jG. H. Umbsen & Co., calls attention to
â¢ ! the large improvements in progress in the
; district east of Third street and south of
i Market street. Among these are the fol
lowing: The Miller, Sloss & Scott building,
' that will cover an entire fifty varas on the
. f=outh corner of Mission and Fremont
streets, and adjoining on the nfty-vara lot
en the east corner of Mission and First
s-treets. the children of the late Colonel
Crocker will erect a building of five sto
ries. On the east corner of Kirst and Jes
sie streets Louis Metzger has put up a
four-story brick structure of granite and
brick containing stores and lofts, while
his partner, Louis Schoenberg. is Just fin
ishing a five-story store and office building
j on the north corner of Second and Jessie
i streets. An addition to Mission street, on
i the southeast line, between New Mont
j cry and Third streets, is the great six
story construction of Edward McLaughlin
of stone, terra cotta and pressed brick.
I and on the north corner of Mission and
j Annie streets Herbert Law is about to
build a five-story brick structure. George
j E. Dow has completed a five-story brick
factory on the southeast side of Natoma
street, between First and Fremont streets,
while a three-story brick warehouse has
been built by Edward E. Kentfield on the
i west side of Beale street, between How
ard and Folsom streets, and Henry E.
Bothin Is completing a handsome brick
machine shop on the west corner of First
and Clementina streets. Other prominent
improvements are the Morgan manufac
tory and warehouse building on the south
west corner of Second and Stevenson
streets, the large warehouse being built
by Major Tilden on a double flfty-vara lot
on Spear and Main streets, between Fol
som and Harrison streets, and three four

The building contracts of the week are
for large buildings, but the average num
ber of buildings of the smaller class is on
the list. They are scattered over all sec
tions of the city.
Attention has been called to the excel
lent work accomplished by the Nine
teenth-avenue Boulevard Club, in the dis
trict south of Golden Gate Park. The
boulevard is now curbed, graded and
macadamized and on official grade for
over a mile and a half from the electric
line and H street as far south as R street.
The work is progressing in the direction
of W street and the Ocean road to connect
with Ingleside. The total expense to the
property owners for street work alone will
be over $50,000. In addition quite a large
sum was subscribed and expended for the
planting of bunch grass west of Nine
teenth avenue to prevent the drifting of
sand over the driveway. The club also
has persuaded the Spring Valley Water
Company to put in a water main along H
street as far west as Nineteenth avenue,
supplying residences with water. Gas
mains will soon be extended along to the
Nineteenth-avenue boulevard. The offi
cers of the club are: Charles W. Pope,
president, and Carl Larsen, secretary.
H. E. Poehlman, real estate agent, has
removed to 316 Montgomery street, near

PECULIAR FISH CAUGHT.
Has a Head Xrike a Wolf and a Fair
of Enormous Tusks.
E;Â«c1&l Dltpttch to The Call.
VANCOUVER. B. C. April 20.â The
most peculiar specimen of a fls\ ever seen
here was brought in to-night by the hali
but eteamer New England. It was caught
off the coast of the Queen Charlotte Isl
ands on Tuesday by two dorymen. named
Ham Harris and Tom Smith. The flsh Is
over liftef-n feet long and weighs about
1200 pounds.
It is shaped rather like a blackflsh
but the skin is velvety and the fins are
ranged along the back in an altogether
unique manner. Its head is very email
for the size of the body and has the ap
pearance of the head of a wolf. Its ex
pression Ss fearful and the ferocious ap
pearance is added to by a pair of enor
mous tusks, which protrude Jive Inches on
oith'T side of the mouth. The two men
nearly lost their lives in killing the fish
In the rage of Its fight it threw itself half
over the dory, and if another had not
come to their assistance the boat would
have been swapped.

Esedal Dispatch to The CalL
PHOENIX, Ariz., April 20.â Lieutenant
Dorsey Cullen of the Ninth Cavalry, sta
tioned at Fort Grant, left a few days ago
with a detachment of cavalry to take thÂ«
trail of the Chiricahua Apaches who shot
J. D. Mack, a mining man, in Plnara
Canyon two weeks ago. The trail was
taken up by a detachment from Fort
Grant Immediately after the outrage was
reported and a skirmish with the Indi
ans was reported to have taken place.
Indian trailers attached to the command
were placed on the trail of the retreatnlg
Apaches, but the renegades succeeded In
covering their tracks and the trailers
were compelled to return to the fort.
Later tho trailers were provided with five
days' rations and they were reported as
having found a fresh trail of the murder
ous Apaches. They took up the trail and
followed It into the Chlrlcahuas until it
was completely obliterated by snow
which fell in a storm that overtook the
trailers in the mountains. The storm wa.s
of short duration, and as soon as the
snow melted the trailers resumed their
work, and Lieutenant Cullen and hi 3 com
mand of troopers are following closely
on the heels, of the Indians.
A fl|?ht with the renegades Is expected
at any time. Chris Grauor, a cowboy who
met the soldiers In the Chlrlcahuas, came
In to-day. He said that Lieutenant Cul
len thought he would Boon overtake the
Indians.

WALES GIVEN A
WARM WELCOME
BY LONDONERS
Populace Rejoices Over His
Return Unscathed From
Copenhagen.
LONDON, April 20.â The Prince of
Wales arrived at Dover this evening on
his return from his visit to Copenhagen,
and the occasion was marked by scenes of
remarkable enthusiasm. The return of
the Prince . was made the occasion for
spontaneous demonstrations of enthu
siasm by thousands of persons who
thronged the Charing Cross station and
its approaches, waiting patiently to show
their gladness at the heir apparent's es
cape from death. The whole route to
Marlborough House, especially the Mall,
was thick with people, and the police had
the utmost difficulty In controlling the
crowds. The Duke of York awaited his
father's arrival on the platform and when
the train bearing the Prince drew In a
mighty shout went up from the mass of
spectators.
By that time the King of Sweden, now
on a visit to England, his white head
inches above the-.- waiting crowd, had
Joined the Duke of York. -vr
When the Prince of Wales stepped out
of the train he was affectionately greeted
and congratulated by his son and the vis
iting sovereign, and amid tremendous
cheering he entered a carriage and drove
off with the Duke of York. Behind his
closed vehicle was an open carriage con
taining- King Oscar, who received an ova
tion which almost equaled in enthusiasm
that of the Prince of Wales, and to which
his Majesty vigorously replied by waving
his hat, which urged the crowd to still
further enthusiasm. , All along the route
similar scenes occurred, the crowds around
Marlborough House being particularly
large.
The spectators of the Prince's homecom
ing consisted chiefly of the well-dressed
and eminently respectable residents. From
their comments it was evident how gen
uine and heartfelt was the gladness over
the Prince s escape from Sipido's bullet
The most common remark was, "How
well he looks," and from the. women.
What a blessing he has come back safe
and sound."
â¢ King Oscar's unexpected and democrat
ically expressed enthusiasm created in
tense delight and made that monarch
quite the hero of the hour.

tlon with Miss Bertram's betrothal to
d'Essauer. When Henley passed away
Miss Bertram had him cremated and part
of the ashes inclosed in a heart-shaped
locket of gold-lined olive wood, which
Miss Bertram is said to have worn all the
time next her heart. When Miss Bertram
exchanged vows with d'Essauer she went
through a very spectacular ceremony with
the heart-shaped casket and Henley's
ashes. Miss Bertram, d'Essauer and some
members of the Bostonians went to the
Cliff House In San Francisco, had a de
lightful dinner, during which the celebra
ting twain renewed their vows of affec
tion, and thc,n Miss Bertram, solemnly
took off the charm which held Teddy's
ashes and cast it far out into the sea.
Bought Miss Bertram's Costumes.
D'Essauer is said to have furnished
Miss Bertram's costumes for "The Vice
roy," robes which astounded judges of
finery, the dresses being real silk velvet
and rare stuffs from Eastern climes, em
broidered with Jewels and splendid bullion
designs, sketched for the costumes by
celebrated artists.
Miss Jackson was called upon to sing a
soprano role In "The Viceroy" when Miss
Bertram was oppressed to hysteria by rev
elations regarding d'Essauer, and Miss
Bertram refused to allow her young un
derstudy to wear her resplendent gowns.
A costumer was called in to make an es
timate of what the dresses* would cost In
duplicate. The costumer declared he could
not duplicate them at all in material, and
that the nearest he could come to such
extravagance was to imitate, and this du
plicate In pretense would cost over $1000â
profligacy which stunned the Bostonlan
management, which- had allowed Miss
Bertram about $400 for dresses. iJV"i .X
In the fall of 1596 d'Essauer was em
ployed by the New York Silver Manufac
turing Company as a traveling salesman.
The company decided during the campaign
to present McKlnley with a silver loving
cup. D'Essauer was assigned to arrange
for the presentation and make a speech.
In connection he met Senator Hanna and
other wealthy financiers and politicians.
Soon afterward he gave up his position as
salesman and is reported to have told a
friend he intended to devote his attention
to finance in the future, as his association
with politicians had convinced him it of
fered a good field.. It is said he had the
support of some prominent politicians in
his flrst venture, but his methods were too
bold for even them and they dropped him.

TWO OF THE ACTORS IN A STORY OF ROMANCE AND FRAUD.
CHICAGO, 'April 20.â New stories re
garding S. George d'Essauer, the bond
forger, and his mad career as a finan
cier and a squire of dames, are daily
coming to the surface and suffice to keep
the general public as well as the vic
tims of the swindler's financial opera
tions interested.' A story sent out from
Leavenworth, Kans., is to the effect that
it has been discovered that at least
$147,000 worth of bonds of the Leaven
worth Improvement Company were put
upon the market by d'Essauer. In order
to determine how much more was floated
by him the company has called in its
entire Issue for examination.
D'Essauer'e peculations as brought to
light up to date aggregate nearly $600,
00<J. D'Essauer's wife was Elizabeth Har
vey, wnose granaiather, John Van Nort
wick. had left her iOO.OOO, held in custody
by her mother. There were two sisters.
They were heiresses to big estates, and
both married at about the same time,
Elizabeth having broken a previous en
gagement with Samuel Insull, the mil
lionaire president of the Western Elec
tric Company of Chicago, who recently
wedded Gladys Wallis, the actress.
Mrs. d'Essauer Attempts Suicide.
Mrs. d'Essauer is at present with
frienas in this city. She is reported to
nave attempted suicide last week by
swallowing carbolic acid. Timely inter
ference of companions and relatives
saved her life, but her face is said to be
horribly burned with the fiery fluid.
D'Essauer's affair with Miss Bertram
caused his wife much grief and rage, but
her friends declare that the alleged dis
honesty of her husband and his unjust
appropriation of money held for her by
her mother, Mrs. Harvey, cut her more
keenly.
Miss Bertram is still in weeds for her
second husband. E. J. Henley, whom she
lost and mourned violently for a year,
when, it is said, d'Essauer s fascinations
and luminous pocketbood dimmed her
sorrow long enough to permit her to re
ceive constant attentions from that gen
tleman, who showered her with costly
gifts and finally made over to her J50.009
worth of bonds. After this transfer,
which took place in California, Miss
Bertram vowed to forget Henley and de
vote herself forever to the dazzling Chi
cagoan.

HAWAIIAN BILL
THE THEME OF
SHARP DEBATE
Senator Cullom Explains
the Changes in the
Measure.
Strong Opposition to the Provision
Requiring the Payment of a $5
Poll Tax Before Voters
May Register.
WASHINGTON. April 30.â The Senate
had under consideration during the
greater part of to-day's session the con
ference report on the Hawaiian civil gov
ernment measure. Cullora made an ex
tended explanation af the changes in the
bill. The report was tht? subject of sharp
criticism. Final action upon it was post
poned until to-morrow.
The Alaskan civil code bill was consid
ered for a brief time. Bate of Tennessee
delivering a speech in opposition to the
pending Hansbrough amendment relating
to the rights of alien miners.
Bacon of Georgia offered two resolutions
in the Senate to-day, one Inquiring of the
Secretary of War whether or not army
officers had received or were receiving
salaries for the performance of civil du
ties In addition to their regular pay. and
the other asking about the expenditures
made for rent of officers' quarters,
equipage and all similar expenses. Bacon
raid the first resolution was introduced in
response to a challenge made yesterday
by Chandler. He had no Epecific informa
tion upon the subject, and. indeed, had re
ceived assurances that no such extra sal
aries were paid. As to the second resolu
tion. Bacon said he did not wish to be
understood as preferring charges of ex
travagance against either the administra
tion or the army officers. He had no defin
ite Information respecting expenditures
of officers in Porto Klco and Cuba, but
said rumors were in circulation that
gTeater expenditures had been made on
the quarters and furnishings for our offi
cers in Porto Rico and in Cuba and for
their other expenses than had been made
for the comfort and convenience of the
former Spanish Governors of those isl
ands. He did not vouch for these state
ments, but thought htey ought to be In
yesiigated. Both resolutions were ob
jected to and went over.
Hale presented the conference report
upon the additional urgency deficiency
bill, and it was agreed to.
War Tax Inquiry.
Galllnger offered a substitute for the
resolution he introduced yesterday asking
for information as to the revenues de
rived from stamp taxes. The substitute
directs the Secretary of the Treasury to
furnish a statement of the sum derived
from the war xevenue act, the items re
garding each subject of taxation to be
stated separately. The resolution was
agreed to.
Cullorn then called up the confernce re
port on the Hawaiian Government bill and
made a peneral explanation of the work
of the conferees.
A ions: discussion took place over a pro
vision reentries; the payment by residents
of Hawaii of a poll tax of Jo before voters
could be rcpistered. The provision was
opposed by Tillman, Teller, Jones of
Arkansas. Stewart and others. Cullom,
in charge of the report, said that if it
were sent back to conference he would
favor the elimination of the poll tax pro
vision.
In conclusion of his explanation of the
measure Cullom summarized the advan
tr.pos to this country of the annexation of
Hawaii. He presented a general review
Df the resources of the Hawaiian Islands,
and showed that since they came under
the f=tars and stripes they had experi
enced the greatest material prosperity.
He thought no citizen of the United
States need feel any doubt as to the Intel
lectual, moral or financial standing of the
Hawaiian Islands.
"These people have brought with them
a splendid educational system," he said,
"and a prosperous agricultural establish
ment, and all classes of rice, sugar and
coffee planters are engaged now in busi
ness profitable to all concerned."
The report was postponed until to-mor
row, when Culiom said he hoped to be
able to dispose of It.
Alaskan Code Bill Taken Up.
President pro tern. Frye announced the
appointment of Carter of Montana and
liarris of Kansas as members of the
Board of Visitors to West Point.
Consideration of the Alaskan civil code
bill was then resumed. Bate, a member of
the Committee on Territories, addressed
the Senate in opposition to the Hans
brough amendment. Bate maintained
that in view of all circumstances neither
the Hansbrough nor the Carter amend
ment ought to be adopted. The law. he
urged, ought to be left as it was when
the riphts of locators were acquired.
Foraker presented resolutions express-
Ing the sorrow of the Senate at the death
of Lorenzo Danforth. late representative
from Ohio, and . pronounced a fitting
eulogy of the deceased statesman. The
resolutions were adopted, and as an addi
tional mark of respect the Senate, at 4:40,
adjourned.
CABLE BILL SUBSTITUTE.
House Favors Private Construction
of the Line.
WASHINGTON. April 20.â The House
Committee on Commerce to-day substi
tuted the Sherman bill for the construc
tion of a Pacific cable in place of the bill
recently passed by the Senate.
The Sherman bill had been previously
reported to the House, but to-day's action
puts it in the form of a substitute for the
Senate measure. It differs from the Sen
ate bill In providing construction by pri
vate contract under Government super
vision, while the Senate bill provides for
Government construction and operation.
WRANGLE OVER
ARMOR PLATE
IN THE HOUSE
Provision for the Payment
of- $545 Per Ton
; . Defeated.
Majority Bef uses to Allow a Discus
sion of the Proposed Establish- *
men t of a Government
Factory.
WASHINGTON, April 20.â As a result
of a protracted struggle in the House to
day the provision of the naval appropria
tion bill to enable the Secretary of the
Navy to contract for armor for the
battleships Maine, Ohio and Missouri,
now awaiting their armor equipment, at
$545 per ton, the price asked for Krupp
armor, is out of the bill, as is the provi
sion to repeal the $300 limitation placed
upon the price of armor by the current
law. The fight came at the end of the
consideration of the bill. Although the
provision was obnoxious to the rule all
the minority members, of the committee
had agreed to it, but to-day when the ma
jority declined to allow the discussion of
a proposition for the establishment of an
armor-plate factory they retaliated by
raising a point of order against the two
provisions referred to and they were rulea
out.
The exact effect of the action of the
House to-day is disputed. The appropri
ation of $4,000,000 under the head of "armor
and armament" remains in the bill, as
well as the language of the proviso au
thorizing the Secretary of the Navy to
contract for armor of the best quality for
the Maine, Ohio and Missouri, the words,
stricken out being "at a cost not to exceea
$545 a ton, including royalties."
It is contended by some that this em
powers the Secretary to contract for the
armor plate without regard to cost. By
others it is claimed that the provision will
be ineffective unless the Senate inserts the
price. So much bad feeling was aroused
by the wrangle over the armor-plate pro
vision that Underwood of Alabama began
a filibuster after the bill was reported to
the House and finally forced an adjourn
ment without final action on the bill.
Before the armor plate question came up
two amendments to modify the provision
for the Increase of the navy, which au
thorizes two battleships and six cruisers,
*-ere defeated. One proposed to add pro
vision for six gunboats and the other to
strike out the provision for the battle
ships. The question of building ships In
Government yards did not reach a vote,
â¢is the amendment offered to this end was.
ruled out on a point of order.
Annapolis Improvements.
This was the day devoted under the
rules to the consideration of war claims,
but the Naval Affairs Committee desired
to go ahead with the naval appropriation
bill. Foss, acting chairman of the com
mittee, moved to proceed with its consid
eration, but the motion was contested by
the Committee on War Claims, and a roll
call was forced. The naval committee
wonâ lo to 97â and the consideration of the
naval appropriation bill was resumed.
Cannon, chairman of the Appropriations
Committee, asked unanimous consent for
a modification of the language of the
amendment adopted yesterday relative to
the Naval Academy. The proposed modi
fication made only one substantial change,
authorizing the Secretary of the Navy,
after plans have been approved, to con
tract for all or part of the Improvements
at Annapolis within the $6,000,000 limit.
The amendment was agreed to.
Dlnsmore of Arkansas made a point of
order against the section to increase the
active list of surgeons to fifty-five and of
assistant surgeons to 110. and providing
that assistant surgeons who served in the
war with Spain and who are now in the
navy might be given permanent commis
sions without limitation as to age. It also
provided that assistant surgeons in the
navy should rank with assistant surgeons
of the army. Dinsmore criticized the lat
ter provision, which, he said, would raise
the old difficulty between the line and
-the staff. It was an attempt to have one
corps creep along at the expense of
others. ' . â ._
Meyer of Louisiana, a member of the
committee, replied that young surgeons
would not enter the service at the reduced
rank. Dinsmore finally withdrew the point
of order.
Foss offered an amendment, which was
agreed to, providing that the Chief of the
Bureau of Ordnance should not be an
officer below the rank of lieutenant com
mander. r ',J . ' ,
' Fitzgerald of New York offered an
amendment to build four of the ships au
thorized by the bill in Government yards.
Foss raised a point of order against the
amendment, which, after* prolonged de
bate, was sustained. On appeal the chair
was sustainedâ B2 to 74.
House Sustains the Speaker.
Vandlver, a member of the committee,
offered an amendment to appropriate
$2.CK)0,000 for the erection of a Government
armor plate factory and for the appoint
ment of three officers of the navy to select
a site for such factory. Dayton made a
point of order against the amendment and
insisted upon it despite the protest of Un
derwood of Alabama, who said it was out
rageous that a proposltin involving the
whole question of armor plate, which had
been agitated for five years, should bo
strangled. He said the fifty minutes of
fered the, other side was manifestly Inade
quate and in effect a decision that the
House was to be led like a bull with a
ring to the bar of the House and made to
vote. Vandlver- charged that the agree
ment made earlier in the debate was in
effect that there should be an hour on a
side for the discussion of the armor plate
question and that the agreement was be
ing violated. To throw out this amend
ment, he said, would be to place the Gov
ernment again at the mercy of the armor
plate trust. The chair sustained the point
of order, from which decision Underwood
promptly appealed.
Underwood, reviewing the history of the
armor plate controversy, proceeded to
show the situation which confronted the
country. Under existing law Congress
could not buy armor except at $300 per ton,
and the provision in^-the bill to pay $545
for the armor of the Maine, Ohio and
Missouri, he claimed, was a change of the
existing law and therefore out of order.
He was called to order several times by
Hepburn for not speaking to the appeal,
and finally.' amid increasing excitement
and confusion. Hepburn made the point
that when called to order Underwood
must take his seat. Finally ttie debate
was closedâ 96 to 82â and the chair was
sustainedâ 97 to 83.
Vandiver then made the point of order
that the provision to pay $545 a ton* for
the armor of the Maine, Ohio and
Missouri was a change of existing law
and therefore out of order. The act of
March 3. 1599. he said, limited the cost of
armor plate to $300 a ton. The act of the
previous year limited the cost to $400 a
ton. The point of order was debated at
length and finally was sustained by the
chair. The Democrats greeted the decis
ion with applause.
Bill Reported to the House.
Bingham of Pennsylvania, speaking to
a pro forma amendment, denied on the
authority of Mr. Cramp of the Cramp
Shipbuilding Company that there ever had
been a proposition for a combination be
tween his firm and the Carnegie Company
on the subject of armor plate.
Wheeler of Kentucky said the minority
had not desired to defeat the provision to
pay $545 for the Maine, Ohio and Missouri,
but it was driven to raise the point of or
der by the refusal of the majority to allow
a test of the sentiment of the Houso on
the question of establishing an,armor
plate factory.- The provision for the re
peal of the restriction of $300 a ton in the
current law went out on a point of order.
An amendment, offered by Roberts of
Massachusetts., to authorize the construc
tion of a metal workers' shop at the Bos
ton yard and appropriating $100,000 there
for, was adopted.
Without further amendment the bill was
reported to the House,
Underwood, Democrat of Alabama, de
manded a separate vote on each amend
ment'and on the first roll call made the
point â¢ of no quorum. The Speaker was
unable to count a quorum. whereuDon Un
derwood moved an adjurnment. The mo
tion was lost, but the quorum failed on '
the next vote, and at 6:25 p. m.. without
finally disposing of 'the bill, the House
adjourned.
QUAY CASE TO
BE VOTED UPON
NEXT TUESDAY
Both Friends and Opponents
of the Ex-Senator Claim
Victory.
Senate Committee on Elections De
lays Its Report on the Bight
of Clark of Montana
to a Seat. j
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL, HEADQUARTERS." WELLING
TON HOTEL. WASHINGTON, April 20.â
Under agreement in the Senate the reso
lution referring to the seat of Senator
Quay was postponed to-day, with the dis
tinct understanding that It will be taken
up to-morrow and the discussion contin
ued until Tuesday afternoon, when a vote
wJll be in order at 4 o'clock. r Â¦Â¦:'
Both sides are still claiming success.
Friends of Senator Quay have dropped
their estimate of their majority to two.
The opponents refuse to give figures, but
say they have votes to spare.
It was Intended to hold a meeting of the
Senate Committee on Privileges and Elec
tions to-day to consider the report of the
committee. in the case of Senator. Clark of
Montana, but owing to the recent changes
made in the text of the report, it was
found Impossible to prepare it for presen
tation at once. It now seems probable
that no meeting will be held before Mon
day. This postponement will I render it
practically impossible to dispose of the
case in the Senate before the vote is
taken in the Quay case, as some Senators
had expressed a desire to have done, but
there is a general understanding about
the Senate that all questions on this
point will be settled by Senator Clark's
refraining from voting in the Quay case.
The principal difficulty in agreeing upon
a report is found in the treatment of the
episode connecting the Montana Supreme
Court with the Clark contest. There are
also some difficulties as to the methods of
treating Congressman Campbell's and ex-
State Senator Whiteside's connection with
the case. The majority of the committee
is disposed to use the testimony concern
ing the State court as strongly corrobora
tive of the general charges against Clark,
while Senators Pettus. Harris and Ale-
Comas take the position that, as there
was no proof connecting Clark with the
alleged approaches to the court, this tes
timony should not be used as desired by
the majority. There Is an effort in
progress to adjust these differences of
opinion, but if this is found impracticable
the three Senators mentioned will, while
agreeing in the general verdict, express
dissenting views on this point. There is
also a possibility of dissent upon the
methods of Campbell and Whiteside. In
no event will there be any division as to
the recommendation that the seat occu
pied by Clark shall be declared vacant.
The parts of the report upon which
there will be unanimity of opinion are
those dealing with the general charges
against Clark. Stress is laid upon the tes
timony concerning the business dealings
with members of the Legislature, such as
McLaughlln, Woods and Warner, and the
present to Day and the acknowledged use
of;large sums of money. Considerable at
tention is given to the fact that Senator
Clark's committee disregarded the laws of
the State in failing to make reports of ex
penditures in the campaign. In the mat
ter of the Whiteside exposure, including
his handing over to the State $30,000 al
leged to have been paid by Clark's friends
for votes, there is a frank avowal of dif
ference of opinion. The incident is. there
fore, related without any specific conclu
sion as to its bearing on the result.

VETERAN OF THE WAR
FOR GRAND MARSHAL
THERE will be a strong contest in
the Grand Parlor of the Native Sons
of the Golden West next week at
Oroville for the ofSce of grand mar
shal, as there is a preat and general de
sire on the part of the various parlors to
se Â» their favorite at the head of the grand
parade in celebration cf the fiftieth anni
versary of the admission of California
to statehood. One candidate who has
shown a creat deal of strength is Lieu
tenant Colonel Charles L. Boxton. who is
a member of National Parlor. Lieutenant
Colonel Boxton served with the First
California Regiment in the Philippines
and Â»as one of a number of national
guard-men nati\ - es of this State who or
ganized a parlor which was. by reason of
its members having been taken from the
National Guard, named the National. He
has always taken a deep interest in the
crder during the sixteen year? that he has
b^en connected with it. His parlor takes
gT*Â»at pride In him and urges that he is
just the man for the position cf zrand
marshal by reason of his military knowl
edge.
The National Parlor urges the fact that
It has not been recognized on the boÂ«rd
of grand officers in the oast ten years and
that now that It has the opportunity to
present a candidate for a most onerous
Â£osition it does so with assurance that
,!eutenant Colonel Boxton Is the right
man to fill the ofSce. His military record
is as follows: He enlisted in Battery C.
Second Artillery, in August. ISS4: was ap
pointed corporal in December. IS-S5: pro
moted sergeant tn May, ISST: commis
sioned first lieutenant December. IbSS:
commissioned captain June. 1?32: re-elect
ed September. V&\: commissioned major
December. lS:-"5. cf the First Battalion of
the First Infantry: went to the Philip
pines with the First California: was com
missioned by President MeKinley brevet
lieutenant in July, 1539. and on the return
of the regiment to this city and before it
was mustered out he was by the Governor
commissioned lieutenant colonel of the
regiment. He is a member of the Board
cf Supervisors and dean of the dental de
partment of the College of Physicians and
Surgeon?. He Is a genial gentleman and
a loyal native son.

Health does not always set in imme-
diately after a person makes a change in
djet. nor docs sickness always set in im-
mediately after bad habits are taken up,
but the daily life maintained by good
food aad jrood drink, free from poison-
ocs elements like coffee, will gradually
build ia new and perfect cells ia the
hamaa body, so that month by month
a rturdy and steady condition of health
is set tip that will carry a person
through many irregularities of " sleep

hard work, whereas a person who is
just barely well, subject to continual
trouble from 'some scrt of ailment
caused by coffee and its effects on the

and be unable to carry Â«out the work of
life. Moderation and a wise selection of

ACTION OF KILPATRICK
DISMISSED ON DEMURRER
He Will Now Be Tried by the Board
of Education on the Old .
Charges.
E. C. Kilpatrick has received a facer
from the the Superior Court, his suit to
prevent the Board of Education hearing
the charges preferred against him hav
ing been dismissed.
When the charges preferred ajrainst KIL
patrick by the last board were taken up
by the present one. he applied for a re
straining order to prevent his trial, al
leging that the charges were malicious
and false and without foundation. The
Board of Education demurred on the
ground of non-suffirier.t facts. This de
murrer has b^cn sustained by Judge Sea
well, and Kilpatrieks - case has been
thrown out of court.
The next step will probably be hfs trial
by the Board of Education on the charges
originally filed. These charges include un
professional conduct, an indisposition to
work and a general unfltnes to be a
teacher In the School Department.

his suffering and sinful children. As a
child she was afraid of the dark, ner
vously apprehensive over approaching
trouble, and given to morbid self-probing.
Her presentiment* in regard to the death
of her mother, whose very slumbers Eliz
abeth used to watch with nervous jeal
ousy, were sadly fulfilled when Elizabeth
was but twelve years old. After this un
expected blow Mr. Gurney. the father, be
came greatly aelf-absorbed. and. naturally
lndulgent.<let his twelve young children
bring themselves up the best way they
could. Utterly unrestrained, their Jivea
henceforth afforded a great contrast to
the systematic religious training which
the mother had enforced. After the vio
lence of their grief had passed away the
bereaved family led the gayest existence
in their beautiful country seat at Carl
ham.
Elizabeth Gumty, the third daughter.
whom the loving mother had called her
"Dovelike Betsy," had grown Into a tall,
slender girl with flaxen hair, extreme ex
uberance of spirits, a flippancy in quoting
the atheistic aphorisms of the French
revolutionists, a fondness -for wearing be
coming scarlet riding habits, for hearing
the band play, for attracting the notice of
admiring officers quartered in the neigh
borhood and for going to the opera, to see
"the prince"â a petted, fly-away girl
whose naive entries In her journal form a
fair Index of her girlhood character: "July
11 â Company to dinner. I must beware of
being a flirt; It is an abominable
character; I hope I shall never be one. and
yet I fear lam one now, a little. Be
careful not to talk at random. If I d~>
pass this day without a foolish action it
will be the first I ever passed so* If I
pass a day with only a few foolish actions
1 may think It a good one."
Strange as It may seem, under these
deliclously diametric characteristics lay
excellent foundation for the hij?h destiny
which Elizabeth Gurney ulthnately
achleved. Her volatile spirits kept her
enthusiasm, when diverted to a more se
rious subject, fresh and vigorous; her
quickness at repartee gave her facility
j in choosing the right word for courtier,
camp or convict; her lively Imagination,
her zest for seizing the strong points of a
situation, lent an almost legal force to her
pleadings for the unfortunate tamed by
her kindly heart, and the cunning of her
; childhood developed into the shrewdest
penetration of the Inwardness of those
: whom she was to influence.
Underlying her girlish archness lay a
habit of self-analysis which frequently
caused her great discomfort. We find in
her journal entries made before she wa>
17 sincerely questioning her right to be so
occupied with trifles, "dress In particu
lar." After several months of strag
glings she decided that her high spirits
ran away with her when dancing and
singing, and that she must henceforth
grive up these greatly enjoyed and other
wise innocent diversions. She had sev
eral lapses Into these, her besetting sins,
and might eventually have drifted back
into her pleasure-loving life had it not
been for the forcible remonstrances of
William Savery. a visiting American
friend. Upon the day of hl3 flrst address
the seven beautiful daughters of Mr. Gur
ney sat- In a row under the gallery of the
Norwich meeting house. Betsy's usual
restlessness being made especially con
spicuous by her smart purple boots laced
with red. From that day. however, her
love for the world seemed gone.
Her father was not a plain Friend, and
fearing that Elizabeth's impressionable
nature might lead her to make resolu
tions which she might afterward wish to
break, he wisely took her to London on a
test visit, of which her journal record 3
a round of dancing, opera aisd rouge. Her
awakened conscience, however, took the
zest out of her gayetles. and when she
again heard William Savery speak in
London her resolution was taken to be
come a plain Friend. She had a horror or
emotional religion, which she believed led
to fanaticism, and she therefore ap
proached with great soberness the deci
sion from which she never afterward wa
vered. Hers was a restless nature, which
developed to the best advantage when
hemmed In by certain fixed restrictions,
and she therefore found a definite support
In Friendly sobriety. In the plain dress

PIERCE RIDS HIMSELF
OF HIS PENT-UP HATRED
Takes the Stand and Scores Toshay
Walker to a Good
Brown.
The relations between counsel for and
against was blended in that of attorney
and witfiess in Judge Cook's court yester
da and the result was some spicy re
marks from VT. L. Pierce in answer to
some close questioning by Foshay Wal
ker.
Walker had been attorney for a Mrs.
Townsend and Pierce had served In a sim
ilar capacity for a Mrs. Brunnings. Mrs.
Brunnir.gs is an incompetent, but before
she became so she set aside some money
she had in bank to Mrs. Townsend, the
terms of the transfer being that if any
thing happened to her Mrs. Townsend
phould care for her. and if she died the
residue of the money thus set aside was
to go to Mrs. Townsend.
It was not lons afterward that Mrs.
Townsend set up the claim that the
money had been given to her as an ab
solute gift and refused to spend any of it
on Mrs. Brunnings. Mrs. Brunnings sued
and recovered somewhere near JS-jOO, of
which I3SOQ was awarded to her counsel.
Pierce, for services rendered. Mrs. Town
send brought suit to have that amount
reduced, and upon that prAnt the case
came before Judge Cook yesterday.
Since the first suit was tried Walker and
Pierce have had but little love for each
other, and so when Pierce took the stand
to tell of the services he had performed
there was a prospect of trouble. Under the
questions of Walker, who throughout was
calm and quiet. Pierce said that his serv
ices were much more than they would
have been If he had not had to try the case
with a liar and a scoundrel as "his oppo
nent. He said Mrs. Townsend should have
pleaded that the money had been left to
her in trust, but that under the advice of
Walker she had sworn that it had been
left to her as a gift, and that increased
his work a great deal. He said upon the
stand that the fact that Walker had said
one thing would be sufficient cause for
him to belive the other, and half a dozen
more such pleasantries, but Walker took
them all without comment and Pierce was
allowed to spit his venom into the air
without objection.
The case wa3 taken under advisement.

The foregoing deplorably . unmetrical
rhyme called "Keep Your School Out of

Hood's diagnosis of her teaching to have
been as poor as the puns In which he
tried to express it.
This woman who braved the ferocity of
the prison inmates and the bantering of
the uncomprehending was naturally of
such timorous temperament that she
could never have achieved her good works
had she not been actuated by the thought
that she was called of God to minister to

INCREASES ITS
SALARY ROLL
Restores More of Its Men
to Their Former Full
Compensation.
Additional Sums Filched From Tax-
payers â Sale of Condemned Gov
ernment Supplies to Be Pre
vented in the Future.
The Board of Health, which recently
retired a number of its employes from
official duty because the Board of Su
pervisors declined to allow a- systematic
raid on the city treasury, restored sev
eral subordinates to the salary roll at a
meeting held last night. The consequence
of this action will be that $700 per month
from now until the end of the fiscal
year will be saddled on the taxpayers.
When the board decided to dispense with
the service* of most of its employes two
months ago it did so only after fully real
izing that there would be no funds where
with to pay them. Two weeks ago it be
gan to undo its first work in that line and
restored "Health Officer O'Brien, Secretary
Brown, Assistant City Physician J*Â»rris
sey and others, to full pay. Last night
It added several more to the roll in its
endeavor to spend every cent It k* 3 ai it 3

The following employes were restored
to the salaries they received before the
wholesale reduction went into effect:
Chief Sanitary Inspector W. P. Chal
mers from JIOQ to $130; Chief Plumbing In
spector J. J. Sullivan from $100 to $125;
Statistician W. D. Griffin from $100 to $1-Vf
per month. These increases are to go into
effect May 1. Dr. Beatrice Hlnkle. as
sistant city physician, was put back on
the salary roll at $100 per month from
May 1. and Clerk Stanton will draw StCO
per month from April 15. Plumbing In
spectors P. Mulligan. J. 11. Daly and W.
H. Tobin at $100 per month _each. and
Sewer Inspector Connolly at $.j. also had
their salaries restored dating from April
15. All of these employes continued to
serve the city without pay when their
services were dispensed with la.Â«t March.
Chief of Police Sullivan assured the

dren of the prisoners which touched their
brutal natures and formed the real key
note of her succcS3.
Capital punishment at that time existed
for Â»Â» different offenses. Th* women of
the prison, tried and untried, were herded
together, with their little children. In a
bare, filthy room, where they were all
supposed to eat slightly, drink freely and
sleep without bedding. Half perished with
the cold and insufficiently clad, they spert
the days gambling and becTrtng for drink
money. The howlmgs cf this Inferno were
so terrible and the savage irresponsibility
of these degraded and maltreated inmate's
was so dangerous that the prison authori
ties Implored Mrs. Fry to leave her valua
bles outside. This she refused to do. and
requested that she might go in alone to
speak with the prisoners. When the doors
had been lockea after her she gently laid
before the astonished women the misery
cf their little ones and besought them to
co-operate with her in organizing a school
for them. Quite touched by her prayers
and solicitations, the women chose the
most trustworthy of their fellow-prison
ers as teacher, soon the mothers also at
tended the skillfully conducted school.
Sewing, wa* taught them, matrons were
appointed and the place gradually as
sumed an orderly and spotless appear
ance.
Another great trial which she assumed
was the personal comforting of prisoners
sentenced to execution. Nothing but a
realizing sense of the genuine supper;
which her sympathy conveyed to tho^e
whose scaffolds were building enabled her
to confront these terrible ordeals, espe
cially when the poor victims were to be
hanged for petty theft, for accomplice in
forsjery or for pasÂ«ir.sr counterfeit notes
without knowledge that they were spuri
ous. So agonized did Mrs. Fry become
over these visits to the cells of the un
justly condemned that she began inquir
ing, to some purpose. "Is it for man thus
to take the prerogative of the Almighty
into his own hands?" As a result of her
efforts among prominent phiianthropist*
and in the House of Commons the p-?nal
decrees were made far more b'jrnar.Â»
Societies were organized to p**>vide in
struction and employment which wouM
make prisoners self-supporting, and thÂ«?
funds necessary to bring about this new
re-rime were raised by John J. Gurney.
Elizabeth Fry's brother. The Government
also intrusted to this heroic band the care
of the transport sÂ«h!pÂ«. artd under ltÂ«
practical wisdom this vile system was re
lieved of much of Its " horror and bar
barity.
Meanwhile financial difficulties and th<Â»
consequent removal from beautiful
Plashet to a cottage at Upton, combined
with the loss of many of her friends arj.l
relatives, sadly impaired Mrs. Fry's
health. Throughout all her trials, how
ever, she was to others the strer.gthener
and consoler. Her increasingly larse
family was also a rreat care, her twelfth
and youngest child being born on the
same day as her first grandchild. She
nevertheless found time to make In tha
companionship of her noble brother sev
eral helpful journeys abroad.
In her journal she thus describes a visit
which the King of Prussia paid to her at
Upton: "I went first <from Newgate>
with the lady mayoress and the sheriff*,
the King next with his own people. I had
to hasten to take off my cloak, ar.d then
went down to meet him at the carriage
door, with my husband and seven of our
sons and sons-in-law. I then walked
with him into the drawing room, wher*
all wa< In beautiful order, neat and
adorned with Cowers. I presented to the
King our eight daughters and daughters
in-law. â¢ â¢ â¢ an< j afterward pre
sented twenty-five of our grandchildren.
"We had a solemn silence before our rneaX,
which was handsome and fit for a kirj%
yet not extravagant, everything most
complete and nice. I sat by the King, who
appeared to enjoy his dinner. p<rfeÂ«tly as
his ease and very happy with us." In ad.
her Interviews with strangers and celeb
rities she prayed constantly to be kep;
"faithful, not forward."
Her pUy for the lonely coast suard.*
men led her to anticipate the modern
traveling: libraries, and through her ex
ertions 50.030 volumes were secured from
the government for distribution amocff
servant* and employes.
A woman of undoubted executive abil
ity. Elizabeth Fry nevertheless possessed
a sLngle-heartednes3 and loveliness of
character such as is not often granted to
leaders of men ensrrossed witn outaida
cares. The secret of this happy combina
tion Is found In a letter to her sister
wherein she says: "Ever since my heart
was touched at 1? years old. I believe I
have never awakened from sleep. In sick
ness or In health, by nisht or day, with
out my first thought being how best I
may serve my Maker."
She died in 1345. Forty years later a
church wan erected to her. memory In tha
garden of her Upton home. Prinees3
Louise laid the foundation stone and
many of Mrs. Fry's great-grandchildren
were present at the ceremony.

Ncui' York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. April 20.â The stock market
continued unsettled and hesitating to-day un
der the Influence of the uncertainty surround
ing the iron and Fteel issues. The undertone
was distinctly firm and the early portion of
weakr.ers gave way to a slow and Irregular
upward movement, doubtless due in large part
to the demend from short Interest to cover.
Thf- rates for loans on stocks this morning on
the floor indicated that the short Interest was
quite large. The comparative quiet of the
Iron and Eteel stocks and positive strength at
a number of points prompted the covering of
fhorts and encouraged what Flight buying for
E^r.eral account there was. n_ger attention
was fixed upon American Steel and Wire all
day in view of the session of the company's
executive committee. The movement of the
Ftock Â»es feverish ani common and preferred
often moved In contrary directions as though
to cause a feeling of uncertainty over develop
ment* in the com par. y. Aside from this con
fusing manipulation dealings in the stock were
apparently largely in ,the hands of the room
traders who circulated many rumors concern
ing the executive committees action. The ac
tion wa_ kept secret until after the close of
the market. With this disturbing factor kept
In the background a number of favorable In- !
fluences were allowed to have play. The coal
ens were all notably strong on favorable trade
report*, the bituminous coal as well as the
enthracite roads sharing in the movement.
The local traction stocks and Sugar moved
upward in a decidedly Irregular manner and I
Texas end Pacific. Canada Southern. New
York Central and Pennsylvania were also
points of strength. The good crop weather
was a sustaining Influence with the grain
carrying road*. Rumors still continue to cir
culate cf new railroad combinations and of
proKpeete of divedends on railroad stocks but
they have no definite authority. The banks
eeem assured of an increase in caeh to-mor
row, having pained nearly *4.0C0.cÂ«XÂ» on sub
treasury oj^ratlons and over half a million
dollars en the express movement with the In
terior. There is rather more mystery than
usual surrounding the item of loans. The liqui

NEW YORK. April 20.â Bradstreet's Finan
cial Review to-morrow will say: This week
the Industrials furnished the sensational ele
ment in the stock market. Their unsteadiness
for some time back in the face of the rising
tendency of railroad shares has already been
fully referred to. and It cannot be said that
Wall street Is altogether unprepared for a de
cline in this portion of the market. What sur
prised and dismayed the speculative public In
connection with the severe break In American
bteel and Wire stocks and the other steel Indus
trials wan the apparently well-founded reports
that the closing down of Home of the company's
mills, though perhaps warranted by business
conditions growing out of overproduction and
decreased consumption at, the prevalent high
prices, was attended by heavy selling of both
the common and preferred stocks by Inside In
terests. In fact, even If the declines In fin
ished steel products furnished a proper cause
for the action of the management In Its sus
pending operations for the time being it was
promptly concluded that the manner In which
this was done and the sudden nature of the
announcement left little doubt as to the soecu!
latlve reason behind the move. Under the cir
cumstances, particularly as there were prompt
confirmations at the reported concessions in
steel prices generally, all of the Iron and steel
stocks, with few exceptions, shared more or
less in the general break and were only rallied
by heavy covering of short contracts. The
railroad jhare list which at first was Inclined
to hold its ground in the face of the de
moralization of the industrials, developed more
or less Irregularity and weakness, which was
natural In view of the rather severe liquida
tion of E^eculatlve accounts In the leadinn
steel stocks In spite of the persistent manipu
lation of the Southwestern and Pacific stocks
reallztng-sales set in on a large scale and prices
generally tended to sell off. London's activity
In the market was on a more restricted scale
although the market there apparently realized
that the difficulty In Wall street related only
to the Industrials and had no actual bearing on
railroad earnings or dividend prospects After
the London market reopened on Tuesday from
Its Ea#ter recess there was some selling by
foreign houses, but later on the European par
ticipation, although mixed in character" was
In the main in the direction of further pur
chases rather than of sales. The continued
firmness of the London money market and the
marked tendency of exchange rates hereto ad?
)'^ c \ c ?u tlnue to attrac t some attention, al
though the money market Is not Influenced by
the prospect of gold shipments In the near
future to such an extent as it doubtless woutd
be if It were not believed that the further ex
pansion of the national bank circulation now fn
progress. will assure easy money in American
markets for some time to come. Favorable
crop prospects In the West have been a factor
in connection with the granger railroad shnrSl

NEW YORK. April to-mor
row will say: More rather than less Irregular
ity In the trade and 'price situation is to be
noted this week, partly the result of weather
conditions, but partly, as In the case of the "on
and steel trade, because of the continuance of
those efforts In the direction of lower prices
which have been such a feature of the Iron
and stepl trade of late. That the basic condi
tions of trade remain on the whole favorable

Railroad earnings continue hea\-y, and the de
crease noted in bank clearings Is chargeable
largely to religious and other holiday observa
tions and to restricted stock speculation Heavy
rains and cool weather early in the week had a
depressing effect on trade and collections but
with the advent of a warm spring temperature

The bear campaign In iron and steel took on
a new phase this week, when a number of wire
mills were _hut down. 5 as alleged, because of
an oversupply of these goods.' The announce
ment has had an unsettling- effect upon gen
eral demand, as was, probably expected and
new domestic business is Interfered with ' The
strength of the export demand previously' noted

and we have the best of reasons for bellevlni
that a very large quantity of Southern Iron

full prices. Price changes are â¢ mostly alonjr
lines heretofore noted, though some sympathetic
weakening of plglron is reported: Wire prices
apparently are. unchanged. Steel - billets are

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
early this week, but weakening toward the
close. The strength of pork products and the
Email movements has stimulated corn, ana
there is less weakness in this than in the other
cereals. Stormy weather and flooded water
courses at the South have checked or retardea
cotton planting, but this feature and the stat
istical strength of the market have not been
sufficient to produce any outside bull move
ment. Â¦â¢..â¢.â¢Â¦Â¦Â¦<
Wool Is weak, but' there is rather more in
quiry, and now, i as one year ago. relatively
highest prices rule at points of production.
Â¦ Backward ' weather conditions have affected
the lumber trade demand, but in this as in a
number of other lines, the advanced prices de
manded are credited with checking business.
The pressure of heavy supplies Is responsible
for the slight weakening shown in the price of
raw sugar this week, while the refined market
remains unchanged. Weather Influences are
again reflected In the market for dairy prod
ucts, which have weakened under large re
ceipts. .
Wheat, including flour, shipments for the
week aggregated 3,898,451 bushels, against
2.896^653 bushels last week, 2,932.959 bushels In
the corresponding week of 1899. 3.232,106 bushels
Jn IS9B, 1,654.668 bushels In 1897 and 1,286,490
Since July 1. this season, the exports of wheat
aggregate 157,804.547 bushels, against, 193.262,119
bushels, last year and 191,503,636 bushels in
1K97-98.
Business failures In the* United States for the
week number 161, against 152 last week. 187 In
this week a year ago, 224 In 1898, 216 In 1897 and
240 in 1896. .
Failures in Canada for the week number 13. as
compared with S5 last week, 30 in this week a
year ago, 15 In 1898, 22 In 1897 and 37 in 1896.

Dun's Review of Trade.
NEW YORK. April 20.â R. G. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade to-morrow will say:
Formal reduction of $5 per ton In prices of
plates and ! bars and closing of mills by the
American Steel and Wire Company have filled
the week with surprises. In the stock market
and In the market for steel and iron products
changes have begun and the end cannot well
be foreseen. Apart from the disturbance in
speculation there has been produced a measure
of distrust regarding prices that are main
tained by the great combinations which may
for the present tend to deter buying. In the
iron business the formal reductions were almost
wholly anticipated in actual sales. Some urgent
and Important contracts have been made. In
cluding that for the New York . tunnel, re
quiring 70.C00 tons at prices not stated, but It
is known that many others have been deferred
until the prospect is clearer.
There Is a slightly better demand for hides
at Chicago, attributed to their Improving con
dition, but the distribution of boots and shoes
does not keep all the factories at work. Some
are closed, many more are running part time,
and very few of those in operation have orders
for a single month. There is no room for
doubt that greatly restricted buying has been
caused by the high prices asked, which the
makers declare unavoidable until prices of
leather yield. The shipments from Boston In
three weeks have been 31.152 cases, or 11.6
per cent smaller than last year and a little
less than in 1898. Yet a large business Is
claimed In leather, which is still held without
yielding and satin Is quoted half a cent higher.
The textile Industries have large orders yet
to be filled, which keep many of the mills
busy, but there are many others less fortunate
and their hunt for orders without much regard
for prices causes irregularity In the lines not
of established position. The staple woolen and
worsted goods hold steady as the makers need
no more contracts, but In less favored, lines,
both for men's wear and In dress goods, the
business is by no means satisfactory- Wool
has been without change In prices. Cotton
goods are by some sold at concessions for
future delivery, as -11 realize that present
prices will not long control cost of production.
Wheat has declined a fraction In price and
corn advanced a fraction, both markets being
rendered comparatively inactive by certainty
that the remaining foreign requirements will
be easily met. Atlantic exports In three weeks,
flour Included, have been 5.976,800 bushels,
against 5,612,744 last year, and Pacific exports
2,347,927 bushels, against 1.152,063 last year.
Failures for the week were IS4 In the United
States against 184 last year, and 17 In Canada,
against 22 last year.

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO. April 20.â Wheat traders climbed
Into the pit at the opening of the session .with
their views concerning the value of wheat
lowered from Uc to %c. This was due to the
fact that Argentine last week shipped 3,750,000
bushels, that cables were lower and the
weather conditions remained the fast friend of
the crop. Having given this exhibition of be
ing awake tho speculative trade proceeded to
slumber. Nearly the whfcle session the fluctua
tions were very narrow, j The cash business
was fair â 15,000 bushels here for direct export
New York put the export demand at thirty
loads and Philadelphia reported thirty-five
loads. This had a steadying Influence which
held to the end. The spread between May and
July widened to lVfec. There was considerable
changing. The crowd sold May and took July
while the elevators in a moderate way re
versed the action. May opened USHc lower
at 65V4&C5Vic to 65e, advanced to . 6S\i@6s%ic
and closed VtC down at 65\4c. July began the
session %c lower at 66%<g66%c to 66% c, touched
66% c and closed a shade down at 66% c.
The corn market largely belonged to the
scalpers. Trade waÂ» quiet and narrow. The
opening was from >4c to He under yesterday.
May closed He down, July HÂ®'ic depressed.
The provision market was weak and lower,
affected by weaker hogs, the lower grain mar
ket and liquidation. Outside selling- was a
feature. May pork closed 10c down; July
closed 15c lower; May lard 12Hc depressed;
July, 12%@1&c lower; May ribs, 10@W&c down;
July, 10@12%c reduced. '
Oats were weak, a matter of sympathy with
corn and wheat. Trade was augmented some
what by the decline, but not- sufficiently to
create anything like excitement. -May closed
%c lower. July closed a shade lower.
The leading futures ranged as follows:

Charged With Assault.
REDDING, April 20.â The three men
who attempted last night to drag Mrs.
Isaac McCandllsa from a buggy have been
captured. They plead Ignorance of the
assault. Their names are given as M. L.
Haas, Bernardo Foxen and Frank Carroll.
The assault was a peculiar one. Mr. and
Mrs. McCandliss were returning from
Keswick when. Just outside the city lim
its the .three men who have been identi
fied by McCandliss Jumped from the side
of the road and with vile oaths attempted
to drag Mrs. McCandliss from the buggy.
The attack was so sudden they nearly
succeeded before Mr. McCandliss could
whip the horses past them. Driving rap
idly to Redding he procured a gun and
started back after them. Had he found
them, instead of the officers rounding up
the tough trio, bloodshed would undoubt
edly have resulted.

CALL'S EDITOR
C. B. Porter Engaged in
Swindling People of
Minneapolis.
Offers Positions, Secures Money From
Hotel Man and Obtains Hail
road Transportation on
Call's Account.
MINNEAPOLIS, April 20.â Claiming to
be editor In chief of the San Francisco
Call, C. B. Portfr, v.ho hus been proven
one of the rankost kind of impostors, has
been \icltimlzing Minneapolis people for
the past wr*ek. He first registered at the
Vendome Hotel and announced that he
was connected with The Call. To several
I>eople he said he was the proprietor and
to others he was editor in chief and also
city editor. He met a reporter for the
Minneapolis Tribune and offered him a
retiponsible position at $50 per week, but
the offer was a fraud on Its face. At the
Hotel Hyser the same man registered as
C. P. Smith, and representing himself aa
a member of Golden Gate Commandery,
Knights, Templar, secured JlO from George
Hyser, the proprietor. The man has not
returned the money and neither did he
call again upon Mr. Hyser. He owed his
bill at the Vendome and was threatened
with prosecution if he did not pay. He
secured money and settled, altnough a
short time betore he did not have a cent.
Porter visited Mrs. Lucy Hewitt, who
has a grocery and confectionery store at
2015 Stevens avenue in this city, and gave
her a letter of Introduction purporting to
have been written by her son. who is said
to be employed as a pressman by The
Call.
Mrs. Hewitt states that it was not writ
ten in her fon's hand and this fact made
her suspicious Â«f the etranger. He called
on her three or four times, but she says
he did not succeed in victimizing her. Her
younger son, who visited his orother In
Â£an i-'rancisco, questioned Porter closely
regarding the office of The Call, with
which he showed by his answers that he
was acquainted. He offered to take Mrs.
Hewitt's younger son to San Francisco
and give him a position at $00 per month,
but the young man refused to take any
stock in his story. Several days ago Por
ter secured transportation from St. Paul
to Portland, on account of The Call, but
when It was discovered that he was an
impostor he was put off the train west of
Minneapolis. It in not known what train
he then took Or where he is now. Mrs.
Hewitt has written to her son In San
Francisco to learn If the letter of Intro
duction was genuine, although she does
not believe it was. She has also asked her
son to let her know of anything else he
may know of the stranger who left bo
suddenly. Porter Is about 45 years of
age and crippled. He says he was once in
a railroad wreck.
The C. B. Porter mentioned In the above
dispatch has no connection with The Call,
ant! no one of that name has been con
nected with the paper at any time. A
short time ngo this impostor attempted
to psss himself off on the Postmaster of
iJanghorne. Pa., as the proprietor of The
Call, and he also stated that he had for
merly been Postmaster of San Francisco.
Postmaster Montague was asked for in
formation concerning Porter by the La.ng
horne Postmaster and immediately com
municated with The Call about the man.
This paper promptly notified the Pennsyl
vania Postmaster that Porter was a
fraud. â¢ 'Â¦

LEGAL BATTLE
FOR POSSESSION
OF A CORPSE
Two Women Claimed the
Body of David Kellen
berger.
It Was Finally Awarded to His
Widow, From Whom He Had
Been Estranged ' for
Many Months.
Special Dispatch to The Coll.
SACRAMENTO, April 20.â Mrs. Adah
Kellenberger of Oakland will bury her
dead husband, David Kellenbcrger, and
the body will be sent to Oakland on the
Oregon express to-morrow morning In the
custody â¢of W. H. Pipps. chief of the
Division of Railroad Conductors, of which
ihe deceased was a member, xhis result
was brought about to-night after the in
stitution of one of the most remarkable
court proceedings in the history of the
State.
For many years David Kellenberger was
one of the best-known conductors on the
lines of the Southern Pacific. His run
for a long time was out of Oakland, and
there he made his home with his wife, to
whom he had been wedded fqr sixteen
years. About three years ago he was
transferred to the run between Sacra
mento and Lathrop. At the latter place
he met a woman named Mrs. J. V. David,
and soon thereafter an . estrangement
came about between himself and wife.
Mrs. David opened a lodging-house in
Sacramento and Kellenberger roomed
there. Several weeks ago he was at
tacked with heart trouble. His wife in
Oakland received word that he was dan
gerously ill and would like to see her
and she came to Sacramento for that pur
pose. Mrs. Kellenberger says that when
she called at the house Mrs. David flew
Into a passion and declared that she
would not permit her to see her husband,
living or dead. Mrs. Kellenberger saya
she asked permission to remain in the
hall until the physician should arrive, but
this privilege was denied her. Mrs.
David then caused the police to be sent
for and Mrs. Kellenberger was removed
from the house where her husoand lay in
his last illness. On Wednesday last Kel
lenberger died.
The wife again came up from Oakland,
this time to claim the right to bury the
body of her own husband, but she was not
permitted to take charge of the remains.
She accordingly employed Attorney C.
M. Beckwith to apply for an injunction
restraining Mrs. David from disposing
of the body. Service was made and the
body placed In the custody of an under
taker designated by the court. Chief
Pipps of the Order of Railroad Conduc
tors, with the wife's consent, made a vain
attempt to secure the body, although he
had brought an Oakland undertaker with
him to care for it pending its interment
according to the rites of that order. James
Kellenberger, a brother, was made a
party to the injunction suit, as it was un
derstood he did not favor turning the body

James O'Sullivan Meets a
Frightful Death in
Oakland.
Pinned Down by a Turntable While
an Engine Passes Over Him
and Crushes Him to
Pulp.
â _Â«
OAKLAND, April 20.â James O'Sullivan,
one of the oldest hackmen of early Oak
land and of late years an employe of the
Southern Pacific Railroad Company, met
a horrible death In the West Oakland rail
road yards to-night. He was ground Into
a mass of unrecognizable fragments un
der an engine. It was O'Sulllvan's duty
to move the turntable at the entrance of
the roundhouse and set it for the track
that the engine wished to take. An en
gine, under the control of Toby Feehan,
one of the hostlers, was on the table,
waiting to reach its berth for the night.
O'Sullivan moved the table around to the
track that the engine was to take, and
then got down to block the table so tnat
it would not swing while the engine passed
off. Feehan waited a few moments and,
thinking that everything was clear,
started the engine. He heard just one cry,
stopped his engine as quickly as possible
and made an investigation. Beneath the
engine was the body of old O'Sullivan cut
into fragments. It was evident that the
old man had slipped when he went to
block the turntable and fallen into the
crack between the table pit and the
ground and was held there while the en
gine passed over him.
O'Sullivan lived at Fruitvale and leaves
a wife, but no children. He was 52
years of age. He drove a hack In the
days when Oakland was full of ready
money and exciting scenes were being
enacted over the securing of water front
and private land grants. He carried
many an important load from strange and
secret midnight meetings where prom
inent men and city and county officials
hobnobbed over private deals at the pub
lic's expense. The old man is said to have
accumulated quite a. fortune In this way,
but worked even In his old age.

CLOSING DAY OF
THE SEASON AT
TANFORAN PARK
Mixed Assortment of Horses
Crossed the Line at
Sunny Odds.
Lady Meddlesome a Clever Winner.
Princess Titania Was Tried and
Failedâ Viking Jumped
Into a Purse.
"Getaway day" at Tanforan Park was
celebrated by the defeat of five out of six
favorites, but, to use the descriptive
phrase of General Sir Redvers Buller,
"the talent retired in good order." Ba
vassa was the lone winning choice, while
Garbo, Viking, Lady Meddlesome, Matt
Hogan and Ace came shambling home at
all sorts of prices.
Corrigan's Antilla ruled favorite for the
maiden event, which opened the sport, but
mud never was to her liking and in a
drive Garbo, a 6 to 1 chance, beat her out
two lengths. The start was straggling,
three horses being left at the post, includ
ing Cue, a hot tip.
Durward was sent to the post favorite
for the hurdle number and was fortunate
no doubt to finish third. Viking, another
6 to 1 chance, with Gus "Wilson in the sad
dle, led from start to finish. Lomo led the
favorite out a- length for place honors.
After a number of unsuccessful at
tempts the two-year-old filly Bavassa left
the maiden class. Backed from threes
to 9 to 5 favoritism, she caught Ada N
during the sail to the stand, winning by
a length. Princess Tltanla, which finished
third, was the warmest thing of the day,
her odds being hammered from 3 to 1
She ran into a pocket at the start, ruining
all chance.
In the mile and a sixteenth selling re
cital Lady Meddlesome repeated her vic
tory of a few days ago, only on this occa
sion the stable did not fall to get aboard.
Galloping off in the lead, with Buchanan
in the saddle, the mare reached the wire
two lengths ahead of Scotch Plaid, the 6
to 5 choice. Captive took the short end of
the purse.
Matt Hogan is beyond cavil a "mudder,"
for his effort in the fifth event was a vast
Improvement over a recent attempt. The
ring laid as good as 10 to 1 about him and
he won in stakehorse fashion â on the bit.
The place went to Proclamation, while
the favorite. Joe McGee, could not scare
up a gallop.
Old Ace, a 13 to 1 shot in the ring, boxing
rlove legs and all. made away with the
final race of the day. Trailing Don Luis
to the stretch, he there assumed the front
position and without much effort downed
the favorite. Acrobat, a couple of lengths.
Dr. Bernays, the second choice, got
caught In the barrier as it was released,
never cutting any figure.
Track Notes.
Oakland track will reopen this afternoon
for the final meeting of the raclne season.
An excellent card of events Is offered the
public, -with a $500 handicap as the stellar
feature.
Moody, who rode Maior S In the hurdle
event, was suspended for his effort on the
Jumper.

Â¦ j 19 5ONE of th<* commanderies that pro-
I poses to phine during the conclave
' of the Knights Templar at Los An
geles next week Is Golden Gate No.
16 of this city, which has its headquarters
in the Golden Gate Asylum. Sutter street
Its principal officers are: Sir Joseph Clay
baugh Campbell, commander; Sir Robert
McMillan, generalissimo, and Sir H. D.
Loveland, captain general.
The commandery was organized when it
was announced that the triennial conclave
of the Knights Templar was to be held in
this city in ISS3. It was chartered on the
21st of April, ISSI, and Instituted with for
ty-three members. It first met in the asy
lum on Post street, near Kearny. but as
the quarters were too small it built its
present asylum on Sutter street and dedi
cated it with appropriate ceremonies in
the summer of lÂ£9l. A pride of the com
mandery is its drill corps, which will take
part in the competitions during conclave
week. The commandery expects to make
a fine showing in the parade.
The members of Los Angeles Com
mandery have arranged to entertain the
Golden Gates Knight 3 and the ladles who
accompany them on their pilgrimage.

IMPROVEMENT CLUBS
DISCUSS CITY AFFAIRS
Want to Know How the Treasure of
the Municipality Is Ex
panded.
Â¦ The San Francisco Improvement Asso
ciation met last night, with President
Fletcher presiding. He announced the
new executive committee, as published
In The Call of yesterday, and it was de
cided that tho new committee should meet
on Monday afternoon next at i o'clock to
elect a president and appoint sub-commit,
tees. The overcrowding of street cars
and the remedy therefor, as v/ell as the
duties of the executive committee, were
given conr-idrrable consideration.
The question of municipal expenditures
occupied nearly all the time of the meet-
Ing. Several members spoke on the sub
ject, and there was a diversity of opinion
a,s to the improvements of the parks and
streets. The burden of the plaints was
a desire to learn how the treasure of the
city is being expended and where there
can be a Raving of money. It was finally
discovered that the committee that had
been appointed to investigate the city rec
ords had not completed Its labors and was
unable to report.
During the running dlscussicn that fol
lowed the depreciation of real property,
particularly in the Mission and downtown
districts, the probable increase of taxa
tion on an increased assessment, so that
the fitrure would run up to $1 05 or $1 07
on the $100. was touched upon. After
quoting statistics as to city expenditures
In the pant and at present the association
adjourned.

From information furnished the West

Jockey Club, the doom of two fir three

poaied. Th<* Oakland tracK people are in
poskOfFion of the confession of one rider,
it is claimed, that throws a whole lot of
light on the defeat of different horses at
Tanforan, where most of the mischief
F'*oTns to have been done.
And if the stewards of the San Mateo
County track :Â»robe tho whole matter to
the bottom, it would not be surprising if
a booKroakor or two were ruled off the
turf, for strong fvidence is held by the
two racing associations against them.

FAIR PLAY WILL BE
GIVEN CONTESTANTS
Sub-Treasurer Jacobs Will Not Be
Allowed to Examine Applicants
for the Cashiership.
Several persons who took the examina
tion In this city recently for the position
of cashier In the United States Sub-Treas
ury at this port filed a protest with the
Secretary of the Treasury against allow
ing Sub-Treasurer Jacobs to examine
them upon the routine work of the Sub-
Treasury. "/I*: Â¦
They suggested that the answering of
the questions propounded by the Civil
Service Commission should be a suffi
ciently fair test, and that the privilege
granted Mr. Jacobs of conducting an ad
ditional examination of his own was un
fair on the face of it and would subject
Mr. Jacobs to much censure should his
brother, Samuel, the incumbent, be the
successful applicant.
Yesterday two of the protestants re
ceived a reply from the Secretary of the
Treasury stating that the standing of the
applicants at the written examination
would be the only test.
SECRETLY WEDS
HER YOUTHFUL
HOTEL MANAGER
Mrs. Tracy, Proprietress of
Leepalmer, Surprises
Her Friends.
The Couple Intended to Keep the
Matter Quiet, but Reference to
the Bride's Age Changes
' Their Plans.
Â¦ ; <
Mrs. M. Tracy, well known as the pro
prietress of the Parmerlee and the Lee
palmer hotels, greatly surprised her
friends yesterday; by the announcement
of her marriage to Amos Jones, the young
manager of the Leepalmer, on Tuesday
last.
The ceremony took place at San Rafael,
and was a quiet affair, but two friends of
the couple being present. It was intended
to keep the fact of the wedding a, secret
for a time, but rumors of an. elopement
gave the bride some uneasiness and she
finally determined to inform her friends
of the true facts.
Amos Jones, the groom, is 25 years of
age. He was a member of the First Cali
fornia Volunteers and served in the Phil
ippine war and on his return assumed the
management of the Leepalmer Hotel, of
which Mrs. Tracy is proprietress.
In a short time the other employes of
the house noticed evidence of love be
tween the young soldier "and his wealthy
employer. ,
Soon It became known that something
was on the bills and on Tuesday, when
the couple left the hotel together, the
knowing ones said that they would return
as man and wife. They were informed of
the marriage and were asked to make no
mention of it. That was two days ago
and the strain of keeping such a rich se
cret was too great to stand up under for
a longer time and the facts leaked out.
When seen last night Mr. Jones spoke
rather reluctantly of His wedding, saying
there was nothing in the affair of interest
to any one but the contracting parties.
Helped by his wlÂ£e he volunteered his
story:
"It was a simple, every-day occurrence.
I had known Mrs. Tracy for a long time,
and when I returned from the Philippines
I entered her employ at the Leepalmer
Hotel in the capacity of manager. A
short time ago we decided to get married,
and just thought that we would keep the
affair as quiet as possible, and' for thai
reason we went alone to San Rafael,
where the ceremony was performed. Wo
notified our friends of the approaching
marriage. and told them to keep it only
frcm open newspaper publicity. Tho gos
sips soon wagged their tongues and a
story of such disparity of ages was cir
culated that we decided to announce it to
all. Why, they claim that I am just 21,
but I am 25, and then they say that my
wife is 50 years old. Well, I will leave
that to any. judge."
The happy -couple were at home last
night to their friends, denying nothing in
the story, but the elopement and the wide
difference in their ages. â¢

T was not the bride that delayed the
V wedding at the fashionable ceremony
jj at St. Luke's on Wednesday. It was
1 1 an infuriated woman who could not
Â«-Â» shoot straight ; and a bridegroom
forced to flight that kept the assembled
company waiting.
For some lime past It ha? been the
recognized thing that a wedding set for
noon be celebrated promptly at the first
stroke of the city bells. This, however,
as things gro. has been the fashion so long
that the tardy habit is about due again,
and the guests at the wedding of the
Jeweler's daughter and the young attor
ney looked upon it as a natural sequence
and accepted the delay in good faith.
Within the church ail moved smoothly.
The altar, with its fair dress of Easter
blossoms, the music, the guests in all the
glory of early spring costumes and the
ushers, an Innovation, married men who
appreciated a man's nervousness at his
weddingâ all pave the many invited guests
food for thought and whisperings.
It was probably the music and the
whispered comments Of the guests that
dulled the sound of the shot outside. It
was a scene to delipht the heart of a mas
ter in statecraftâ all action and but few
words.
The carriages of the groom and his best
man dashed madly up to the church. Out
steps the attendant first and the groom
afterward. Then the heavy lady of the
case comes on the scene, only she- is not
heavy and she is beautiful and young.
What she says will probably never be
known unless the proom or his brother
tells, but she oâ shea a pistol and shoots
just about as straight as a, woman usually
throws. Th^n the brother forces her into
the carriage that brought the happy
proom to church and gives orders that
they drive to the Third and Townsend-
Ftrret depot. All the way down the young
woman is unruly, and when put aboard
the San Jose train she makes all manner
of vain threats. It is all very exciting
but hardly fnterta:nir.gÂ» for it is an old
Ftory.
A poor girl and a wealthy young man.
She nails from the country. San Jose, and
? arris her living by working in the can
nery. But she is pretty, and the young
man fancies the pretty maid to such an
extent that he wants her always by his
pi<se. Together they learn to know and
appreciate all the scenic beauties of their
country. Naturally after the usual lapse
of time the young man wearies of his su
burban beauty, but the girl remains faith
ful. The man decides to marry â some one
els*-. The girl buys a pistol. There is a.
scene on the street in front of the sacred
edifice.
That ought to be the end of tho story.
But !t isn't. Some guests wÂ«re late as
v. ell as the groom. They stood in front of
the church and saw it all. Then they
went Into St. Luke's and told it between
solemn pauses.
It was a beautiful wedding. The bride's
gown was quite the costliest ever worn
by a San Francisco bride. White panne
velvet, training its shiny surface over
yards of floor and covered with lace, old
and yellow. If it had not been for the
little* play of the lady, the groom and
the pistol, the bride's bouquet would have
furnished conversation for all the Easter
teas. It was of orchids, rare and beau
tiful and gorgeously hued. The groom,
who ail admit has an t-ye for beauty, or
<:<=-red it himself. Word was sent to all the
farcy florists In the country to forward
their* rarest blooms. The cost of the bou-
quet was said to be something fabulous â
quite a.* much as the beautiful cannery
girl in San Jose could earn in several
months.
There are some people who are never
satisfied when Just given the salient fea
tures of a story. They want all the petty
details. For these it is written that tho
ceremony at the church was followed by
an elaborate breakfast at the bride's
home on Pine street, and to this same
residence will she and her husband return
when the honeymoon wanes.
Will they be happy? Naturally. There
is an old adage that proclaims bliss un
speakable for the first couple mated In a
new church, and they were the first to be
bound together in the new St. Luke's.
PACKING CONCERN
IS EMBARRASSED
Elie J. Cote Must Meet More Than
Eighty Thousand Dollars
California Packing Company Is Assigned for
the Benefit of Creditors When Attached
for a Paltry Sum.
THE California Packing Company, of
which Elie J. Cote Is president, haa
made an assignment to Juda Neu
man of the firm of Sol Wangenheim
& Co. for the benefit of creditors. Claims
aggregating more than $SO,OOO are out
against Cote. The assets of the business
are thought to be confined to a very lim
ited figure. The creditors of the Califor
nia Packing Companyâ and there are a
number of them holding notes of various
denominations â are of the opinion that
there is no sound business reason for the
financial distress of the company. They
hint at a squandering of money on the
race course and other rapid means by
which a fortune has been scattered to the
four winds.
The California Packing Company is one
of the largest concerns of its kind in this
city. Its establishment is at 101-123 Shot
well street. Until very recently it was
rated as not only financially sound but
prosperous.' The blow to the company
was administered last Tuesday when
Guggenheim & Co. levied an attachment
for $198. Â¦'â¢At.' this time the rumor that
Cote's company was in a bad way had
reached the creditors, and upon a failure
to pay tho demand for the meager
amount due them Guggenheim & Co. took
the action stated. Cote saw the useless
ness of trying to stand up under the bur
den of obligations that fell upon him and
he voluntarily assigned his business to
Juda Neuman, who represents some of
the largest creditors.
The liabilities of the company are for
supplies furnished by the large pickle fac
tories and canneries of this city. Most of
the debts are represented by the personal
notes of Elie J. Cote himself, many of
them being indorsed by . E. B. Patrick
who is Cote's father-in-law. Patrick is
now in a most precarious physical condi
tion, suffering from a tumor on the brain.
Isot all the notes signed by Cote are in
dorsed by Patrick. One for $12,000, which
represents the liability to a single cred
itor, is not secured by a personal guaran
tee. There are many other small notes un
indorsed.and the holders are beginning to
experience troubles of the mind from fear
that the debts will never be liquidated.
Perhaps the heaviest loser will be the
Pacific Vinegar and Pickle Works. Sid
ney M. Smith is president of this estab
lishment. He is now in the East, and un
til apprised of the collapse of the Califor
nia Packing Company knew nothing of its
unsound financial condition. Charles J.
King, who Is secretary of the vinegar
works, as well as the assigned company,
has been experting the books of the lat
ter to see just what is owing by E. J.
Cote. A low figure on the sum due the
Pacific Vinegar and Pickle Works by the
California Packing Company is about $30,
000. It is thought that the liability may
reach $50,000.
Few claims have so far been filed, but
they will likely pour into the assignee
within the next few days. Reddy, Camp
bell & Metson, the attorneys, have been
engaged by the Pacific Vinegar Works to
prosecute their claims. A meeting is ar
ranged for this morning between Cote, the
big creditors and the attorneys. If Cote
can satisfy the demands of the creditors
the attachment may be released; other
wise legal proceedings will be commenced
against him at once.
Just what the nature of the suits to be
brought is neither the attorneys nor cred

FUTILE ATTEMPT
TO OPEN A SAFE
WITH A CHISEL
Amateur Robber Landed in
the Tanks After a Short
Struggle.
Detected in the Act of Opening a
Strong Box, He Makes His Es
cape, but Is Afterward
Captured.
Locked up in the tanks In the City
Prison is a young man, whom the police
believe is responsible for several crimes^
committed south of Market street. \ His'
name Is Harry McKay, alias Roberts. He
was arrested yesterday afternoon by De
tective Charles Cody after a lively strug
gle. The specific crime for which McKay
was taken into custody was robbing the
Niagara House, at 724 Mission street, of
$73 and two silver watches. McKay, it is
alleged, after robbing the cash drawer,
made Â¦ a bungling attempt' to open the
safe, which contained over $700. He at
tempted to open the door with a chisel,
and on being discovered by one of the at
taches he dropped the instrument and
made his escape. An examination dis
closed that the cash drawer had been
pried open with the chisel before the at
tempt was made to force the safe.
Immediately after the robbery was re
ported to Chief of Police Sullivan he de
tailed Detective Cody on the case. From
a description given of the robber he ar
rested McKay, who at one time was em
ployed about the house as a bedmaker.
When taken into custody McKay at first
claimed that the detectives had made a
mistake, but when told that he had been
positively identified as the man who
robbed the cash drawer, as well as mak
ing a futile attempt to open the safe, he
became belligerent and started to assault
the officer. Cody promptly countered him
on the jaw and knocked him out. lie was
then handcuffed and taken to the City
Prison, where his name was placed on the
detinue -book, pending further investiga
tion.
After leaving the prison Cody met
Charles Vickers, a prize-fighter, for whom
he had been looking for stealing a valu
able diamond stud from Aleck Grepgains.
Several days ago, it is claimed, Vickers
represented to Greggains that he was
hungry and penniless and wanted assist
ance. Gregg-ins gave him permission to
stop at his home and to repay his kind
ness. Vickers, it is claimed, stole his dia
mond stud. The diamond was not found
on the supposed thief.
He will be detained In the tanks, pend
ing further investigation.
