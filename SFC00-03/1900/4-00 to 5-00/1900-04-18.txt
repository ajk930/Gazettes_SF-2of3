LONDON. April 17. 11:10 p. m.â The War Office has received the following
dispatch frcnl Lord Roberts, dated Bloemfontein, Tuesday, April 17:
"Our force at Wepener Is still surrounded, but It la reported that tha
enemy are attacking In a very half-hearted manner and are unxloun
about their communications, hearing that forces are approaching Wepener
from two directionsâ one under General Rundle, via Reddersburg, and another
under General' Brabant, with General Hart's brigade In' support, via Rouxville.
"On the reoccupatlon of Rouxville, April 15, the few Boers there retired and
General Erabant made some Important arrests.
'**!oler.t storms of rain have somewhat Interfered with the march of these
columns, but It is hoped they will soon be able to make their presence more de
cidedly felt.
"General Settle reports from Kenhardt,' April 14, that 200 Transvaalers made
a determined attack the previous day on Dopasport, held by a party of Orpons
Horse. Our losses were two killed and one wounded. The enemy's losses must
have been heavy, as they applied to us for doctors and an ambulance."
COLOMBIAN REBELS ROUTED
WITH A VERY HEAVY LOSS
w^- INGS?TON, Jamaica, April 17. â News received here from Colombia says two big 1 battles have been
l.^W fought at Matamundo and Pradera, where the rebel forces under Generals Rosa, Ibez and Caicedo
were completely routed, a large number being killed, wounded or taken prisoners.
The Colombian Government has sent 6000 additional troops north. Peace is reported to be com
pletely restored in the department of Magdalena.
LONDON. April 18. 4a. m.â The Gov
ernment has chosen this as the mo
ment to publish a dispatch from
Lord Roberts pronouncing censure
upon Sir Redvers Buller and Sir
Charles Warren, two of his most important
subordinate commanders. This dispatch
written February 13. has been in the
hands of the War Office for five weeks.
Just why it Is published now, in the mid
dle of the campaign, is not understood,
unless it is expected that General Buller
and General Wairen will ask to be re
lieved of their commands.
The revelation of their incapacity must
tend to undermine the confidence of the
troops in their leadership.
Lord Roberts' dispatch, with the in
closures, is the great feature of the Lon
don press this morning. In a long edito
rial the Daily News speaks of the "some
what appalling language" 'of the dispatch,
and then goes on to say:- "Upon the whole
these dispatchis are disquieting and dis
heartening !n no ordinary degree. Follow
ing immediately upon the recall of Gen
eral Gatacre. they will create a wide
spread feeling of uneasiness and anxiety."
The Standard, which is supposed to be In
the confidence 6f the Government, says:
"It is scarcely likely that the publication
of Lord Roberts' dispatch is without a
purpose. It irresistibly suggests whether
it Is not to be followed by further Import
ant charges In the South African com
mands. Painful as such measures may
be, there must be no hesitation in carry-
Ing them out if they ere required In the
public interest."
The Daily Telegrapn compliments Lord
Roberts upon "not hesitating where great
national interests are at stake to wound
private susceptibilities."
The Dally Chronicle confesses to "a feel
ing seeming like consternation when read
ing the extraordinary passages of the dis
patch." . â ,
The Times says: Lord Roberts' severe
condemnation is Justified only too clearly
by the -official narratives of what took
place. The story Is painful, but It is well
for the nation and for the army that It
should be told clearly and simply, without
concealment or exaggeration. It le not
the least of the great services Lord Rob
erts la now rendering the country that
he exposes with Judicial Impartiality and
wise, wholesome severity errors and omls
elont) in high quarters which have cost us
so very much."
Whether the Government baa any ipe*
proaches. Natives report that the Inhab
itants of Mafeking are very hungry.
Should a flying column be dispatched td
their relief It will find the country well
grassed and watered as it proceeds north-
BOERS DISPLAYING
GREAT ACTIVITY
MASERU, Basutoland. April 16.â The
Boers for two days past have been dis
playing great activity along the Redders
burg and Rouxville road. Their scouts
report that the British are advancing on
those places to the relief of Wepener and
the burghers consequently are divided
whether to remain or to retire. A major
ity of them desire to abandon the invest
ment of Wepener, fearing to be cut off.
while the minority, led by Commandant
Olivier, are reluctant to move as long as
there is a chance to capture Colonel Del
gety's garrison.
Scouts have ' Just reported rifle firing in
the direction of Thaba Nchu.
BRAN PORRIDGE AT MAFEKING.
MAFEKING, April 7.â The success of
Lieutenant Smith-Eaman, the Rhodesian
scout, who, with' the exception of a Reut
er correspondent, a cyclist, is the only
white man who has entered Mafeking
since the siege began. Is likely, to prove
of great value to Colonel Plumer, to
whom he has . returned with dispatches,
should Plumer decide to raise the siege
of Mafeklnc in earnest.
A Scottish crofter has Introduced a
method of making nourishing porridge

CAPTAIN CREWE DEAD.
PLUMERS CAMP. April 6 (via Lour
enzo Marques, April 17).â A letter has been
received here from Commandant Snyman
with reference to the British wounded and
prisoners at the Boer laager after the en
gagement of March' 3l, from which It is
learned that" Captain Crewe died of hla
wounds, LleutenanttMllllffan Is not a pris

cial purpose or not in publishing the dis

ceived will make it most difficult to re
tain the censured commanders In active
Bervice. :'i'.\^
Lord Roberts' long wait and the Boer
activity have seriously disturbed' public
equanimity. He Is still 300 miles from
Pretoria. No one. doubts the ultimate
success of the British arms, but behind
the British army that crushes the Boer
armies an army of occupation will have
to be Installed. From various sources
hints come that more men than are al
ready provided for will have to be sent
out.
Lord Roberts Indicates that Â»t least
10,000 men are advancing to cut off the
Boers who are Investing Wepener. As
there are reports from the Basuto border
that firing has been heard in the direction
of the hills toward' Dewetsdorp it is pos
sible General Chermside's advanced troops
are already in contact with the Boers.
Lord Roberts wires that he expected to
clear the southeast section of the Free
State east of the railway and then to
swing around to the north and to turn
one after another the positions held by
the Boers north of Bloemfontein. Gen
eral Buller's prohibition of all press tele
grams In Natal until further notice Is
taken to indicate that a movement Is
about to begin there.

WASHINGTON, April 17.â Information
reached the War Department to-day that
the transport Thomas left Manila Sun
day for San Francisco with a number of
sick and invalided officers and men, in
cluding Brigadier General Schwan, Colo
nel Kline, Twenty-first Infantry; Colonel
J. W. French, Twenty-second infantry,
and Colonel Snyder, Ninteenth Infantry.
LONDON, April 17.â The War Office to-night published In the Gazette a dis
patch from Lord Roberts, dated February 13, submitting General Buller's
dispatches describing the Spion Kop and other operations from January 14
to January 24. Lord Roberts deals severely with General Warren and some
others. Even General Buller does not escape. Lord Roberts complains that
â¢ the plan of operations is not clearly described in ' the dispatches. After
sketching General Buller's intentions, as communicated to Sir Charles Warren,
who commanded the whole force, Lord Roberts points out that General Warren
seems to have concluded after consultation with his officers that the flanking
movement ordered by General Buller was impracticable, and therefore so changed
the plan of advance as to necessitate the capture and retention of Splon Kop.
Lord Roberts continues:
"As Warren considered it impossible to make the wide flanking movement
Which was recommended. If not actually prescribed, in the secret Instructions, he
should forthwith have acquainted Buller with the course he proposed to adopt.
There Is nothing to show whether he did so or not. But It Is only fair to Warren
to point out that Buller appears throughout to have been aware of what was
happening."
Regarding the withdrawal from Splon Kcp, the retention of which had become
essential to the relief of Ladysmith, Lord Roberts says:
"I regret to be unable to concur with Buller In thinking Thornycroft exercised
wise discretion In ordering the troops to retire. I am of the opinion that Thorny
croft's assumption of responsibility and authority was wholly inexcusable. During
the night the enemy's lire could not have been formidable, and it would not have
taken more than two or three hours for Thornycroft to communicate by messenger
with Major General Coke or Warren. Coke appears to have left Splon Kcp at 9:30
p. m.. for the purpose of consulting with Warren. Up to that hour the idea of
withdrawal had not been entertained. Yet almost immediately after Coke's de
parture Thornycroft issued the order, without reference to superior authority,
which upset the whole plan of operations and rendered unavailing the sacrifices
made to carry It Into effect. On the other hand, it is only right to say that
Thornycroft appears to have behaved In a very gallant manner throughout the
day.- *> Â¦
"It is to be regretted that Warren did not himself visit Splon Kop in the
afternoon or evening, knowing, as he did, that the state of affairs was very criti
cal and that the loss of the position would involve the failure of the operations.
He consequently was obliged to summon Coke to his headquarters, and the com
mand at Spion Kop thus devolved on Thornycroft, unknown to Coke, who was
under the imprrssion that the command devolved upon Colonel Hill as senior otfl
cer. Omissions or mistakes of this nature may be trifling in themselves, yet thoy
may exercise an important influence over the course of events, and I believe
Buller was justified in remarking 'There was a want of organization and system
which acted most unfavorably on the defense.'
"The attempt to relieve Ladysmith was well devised, and I agree with Buller
In thinking it ought to have succeeded. That it failed may In some measure have
been due to the difficulties of the ground and the commanding positions held by
the enemy and probably also to errors of judgment and want of administrative
capacltv on the part of Warren. But whatever faults Warren may have com
mitted the failure must also be attributed to the disinclination of the officer in
the supreme command to assert his authority and see that what he thought best
was done and also to the unwarrantable and neeflless assumption of responsibil
ity by a subordinate officer."
The dispatch concludes:
"The gratifying feature of these dispatches Is the admirable behavior of the
troops throughout the operation."
General Buller' s report, commenting on General Warrens reports of the cap
ture and evacuation of Spion Kop, after disputing the correctness of some of
"Warren's assertions and describing the dangerous situation occupied by General
"Warren's force, tells how he saw the force at Splon Kop had given away before
Warren knew of It. Buller therefore telegraphed to Warren: "Unless you put a
really Rood hard fighting man In command on top you will lose the hill. I sug
gest Thornycroft. 1
General Buller continues: "I have not thought It necessary to order an investi
gation If at sundown the defense of the summit had been taken In hand, en
trenchments laid out and the dead and wounded removed, the whole place would
have been brought under regular military commands and the hills would have
been held. I am sure. But no arrangements were made. Coke appears to have
been ordered away just as he would have been useful and no one succeeded him.
Those on top were ignorant of the fact that the guns were coming up. and gen
prallv there was a want of organization and system that acted most unfavorably
on the defense. It is admitted that all of Thornycroft's command acted with the
irreatest gallantry throughout the day and really saved the situation. But prepa
rations for the second day's defense should have been organized during the
day and commenced at nightfall. As this was not done, I think Thornycroft ex
ercised discretion.
"General Warren sets forth the fact that the Spion Kop operations had not
entered into his original plans, as his Instructions were to occupy a plain north
of It On consultation with the commander-in-chlef. January 21. however, when
the auestlon of retiring from or' attacking Splon Kop was discussed. Warren ex
pressed his preference for attacking. This was successfully accomplished by Gen
eral Woodgate. Then came the order of the eommander-ln-ehief to put Thorny
croft in command on the summit. In the meantime "Warren had sent General
Coke ud to reinforce him, with orders to assume command. Ineffectual efforts
were made to heliograph Thornycroft and ask whether he had assumed com
mand Toward sunset he was finally enabled to get orders through and concluded
the position could be held the next day if guns could be provided and shelter ob
tained Both those conditions were about to be! fulfilled when, in the absence of
Coke whom I had ordered to come and report In person on the situation, the
evacuation took place under orders given on his own responsibility by Thorny
croft This occurred in the face of the vigorous protests of Coke's brigade major
a ? In conclusion General Warren said: "It Is a matter for thecommander-ln-chlef
to decide whether there will be any investigation into the question of the unau
thorized evacuation of Splon Kop."

BERLIN. April 17.â A special to th*
Lokal Anzelger which gives meage**
details regarding the loss near
Mlnecroy of the yacht of Count
Rudolph Festetics .with all on
board save the owner and two servants,
says that among the victims was the
Countess, who prior to her marriage was
Miss Haggln of New York City.
NEW YORK, April 17.â The announce
ment by cable from Berlin was received
in this city to-n!ght that Countess Fes
tetics. formerly Miss Ellen Haggln. of
New York, was among the victims of the
loss of the yacht of Count Rudolph Fes
tetics near Mlnecroy. Inquiry at the resi
dence of Louis T. Haggln. father of tho
Countess, at 2S Fifth avenue, last night,
elicited the Information that she was In
New York and had been for some time.
No word of the disaster had been received
at the Hagsin residence.
Miss Haegin, who Is the graunddaugh
ter of J.. B. Haggln, well known for his In
terests In racehorses and gold mines, and
Count Festetics de Tolna were married
in February-, 1592. They started on their
honeymoon In the yacht Tolna. a gift of
the bride's father, sailing for the South
Seas. The Countess obtained a master's
certificate, owing to her husband's diffi
culty in doing so on account of his not
being a citizen, and their cruise lasterl
for four years. During the cruise amors
the Samoan Islands reports were re
ceived of many varied adventures. Tt waj
announced at different times that they
had lost their crew at Honolulu: that they
were entertining distinguished visitors at
Apia: that they had been taken by pirates
and again had barely escaped being eaten,
by cannibals.
It was oneÂ» reported that the Count
was tlead. For two years the Tolna
cruised the water* of Japan between Yo-
k ohama and Kobe. The Tolna behaved
well In spite of her "rjueerness" and with
stood some violent storms on the voyago
to Australia.
Informed by cable of the Illness of her
mother, the Countess came home in l? 07.
and afterward returned to Yokohama,
which she and her husband had made
their place of residence.
The fate of the yacht Tolna Is of more
than a passing Interest to the people of
San Francisco, as she was fitted up in
this port and sailed on October 10. 1893,
bearing Count Rudolph Festitlcs de Tolna
and hi 3 bride, formerly Ellen Haggln.
daughter of Louis T. Haggin of New York
and granddaughter of J. B. Haggln, tho
millionaire mine owner of this city, on an.
extended honeymoon voyage, they having
been married the 25th of February pre
vious in New York City.
They went from this port to Honolulu
and thence to the Orient, spending joe.i
time In Japan and China, and then gointr
to Australia and the South Sea Islands.
Several times reports reached this coun
try of the loss of the yacht or the violent
death of its owners an<l party at tho

on the way to new ventures.
Count Festetics. who was a lieutenant
in the Eleventh Austrian Hussars and a
son of Count Slslsmunrl Festetics. cham
berlain cf the Austrian court, was said
to be a man of bad temper and such over
bearing disposition as to be unable to
keep any crew of good seamen on board
his vessel, losing some and supplying
their places with such natives as he could
pick up at each port he visited. To this
fact. Implying poor manning for the Uttfts
vessel, may perhaps be attributed her
final loss.

The contractors will put new men at work
on the new Cornell dam In the Croton
Valley at 7 o'clock to-morrow morning.
Owing to the presence of the miTltia It Is
not believed that the striking Italians will
dare create any trouble, particularly as
they well know that many of the soldiers
are quite ready to avenge the killing of
Sergeant Douglass last night.
So confident are the contractors ana

WASHINGTON. April 17.â There is

out of the Sultan's bad faith.

of Sratf whenever circumstances may
necessitate hiy. return.
Diplomacy anpe^r? to have exhausted
Kself at Constantinople, the Sultan having
promised to nay the indemnity claims,
amounting to some EJO.CX), which promise
was again renewed prior to Mr. Straus'
departure, and although sixteen months
have elapsed since the promise was first
rr.ade. that promise still remains unful
:'Mrd. What action the Government will
now take to enforce the Sultan's promise
is not definitely known, as the situation
is critical, and it may result in Secretary
Hay Bending the Turkish Minister at
Washington his passports.
The question involved between the two
countries is no longer one resting upon
disputed points of international law. but
upon the Sultan's broken faith. This Is
not his only promise, he having stated to
our Minister that he would give his per
mit for the reconstruction of the Ameri
can college and school building?, while
tip to the present the official permit, upon
cm excuse and another, has been with
held. '
VVhfn Dr. Angell resigned in 185S the re
lations between the two countries were
Â«ritieal by reason of the inaction of the
Turkish Government and its refusal to
entertain the indemnity -claims. Mr.
Straus, by reason of his successful pre
vious mission and his past experience,
was summoned by the President to take
up the mission as best qualified to adjust
the pending question in a manner satis
factory to both countries. Shortly after
his arrival at Constantinople in Septem
ber. LS9B, several matters yielded to nego
tiation. He then addressed himself to the
main questions, the compensation for mis-
Fior.ary buildings destroyed and for prop
erty looted and the permit for their re
building. The Turkish Government, short
ly b.-fore the departure of Dr. Angell, sent
a reply denying all liability for
i h*> buildings and property destroyed. A
similar reply was sÂ»*rit to the Embassa
flVirs of England, France and Italy, hav
ing like claims. Mr. Straus took up the
question anew, basing his argument upon
the wÂ«-il recognized principles of Interna
tiona] law. with the result that at an au
dience with the Sultan on the Sth of De
cember. ISjS, the Sultan promised to pay
the claims. The claims w*re examined
with great care and scrutiny, based upon
the principle of indemnity for the actual
value of the property destroyed. The Sul
tan also stated that he had given permis
sion for the reconstruction of the destroy
Â»<\ buildings. Neither of these promises
has been kept.

dealt with conditions and not with candi
dates. No names are mentioned In his
letter with relation to the Presidential
nomination to be made at Kansas City,
but I am told It contains some pretty
plain inferences.
Mr. Eastmond said to-night that all the
speakers had responded to invitations sent
to them, except Horace Boles of lowa,
Louis F. Burchard, chairman of the din
ner committee, discovered yesterday that
former Governor Boies was not at the
place to which his invitation was ad
dressed, and It is not known whether or
not he got the letter.
Judge Joseph Willett of Alabama Is now
In New York and will make a speech at
the dinner. Judge Willett has been an
advocate of the nomination of Augustus
Van Wyck ever since the Saratoga con
ference of last summer, and it Is expect
ed that he will urtre the selection of the
Brooklyn man for the head of the national
ticket.
FUSION FAILS.
Rival Tickets Named in the Seventh
Kansas District.
GREAT BEND, Kans., April IS.â The
hopes of the fusionists In the "Big Sev
enth" Congressional District have been
shattered by the action of the Democratic
and Populist Congressional conventions.
Both conventions adjourned at 12:30 this
(Wednesday) morning, after rival can
didates had been named. The Democratic
convention renominated Claude Duval of
Hutchison, a well-known commercial
traveling man. The Populists nominated
1.- P. Campbell of Wichita. This action
was taken after both conventions had ap
pointed conference committees and these
committees had failed to agree upon the
terms for fusion.
Ex-Congressman Jerry Simpson was
not a candidate for the nomination. His
political associates were active workers
In behalf of Duval as a fusion candidate,
with an understanding that Duval should
have the Populist support and that in re
turn the- Democratic vote in the next
Legislature should be cast for Simpson
for United States Senator.
The Populist convention empowered Its
executive committee to effect a fusion
later, with the consent of the convention's
candidate, and upon this action some
hope of fusion is still based.
LOUISIANA'S ELECTION.
Democrats Win on State Ticket and
Legislature. '00 Z
NEW ORLEANS, April 17.â The election
to-day In Louisiana for members of the
Legislature and a full State ticket result
ed in a Democratic landslide. The ticket
headed by W. \V. Heard swept the State
and the Legislature is overwhelmingly
Democratic. 1 â¢ - .
To-day's was the first election held un
der the new legislation disfranchising the
negro, and the battle at the polls has
been almost exclusively fought out by the
whites. The total registration was 129,
000, but owing to unprecedented weather
conditions only about 60 per cent of that
registration was polled. Three tickets
were in the fieldâ the Democratic, headed
by W. W. Heard, the present State Au
ditor; the regular Republican, headed by
E. 8. Reams, and the fusion,' embracing
sugar planters; Independent Democrats
and Populists, headed by -Don Caffery Jr.,
con of United States Senator Caffery. The
Reams ticket, according to the early re
turns, cut no figure in the fight, polling
an extremely light vote. The Democratic
majority in the State will exceed 25,000,
based on returns already in, and may
reach 50,000. - .

BAILEY TO BE SENATOR.
Horace Chilton Withdraws From the
Bace in Texas.
AUSTIN, Tex.. April 17.â Political cir
cles here were greatly surprised to-day by
the announcement, that Senator Horace
Chllton had withdrawn from the United
StateH Senatorial race, leaving Congress
man Joseph W. Bailey a clear field. Sen
ator Chilton's withdrawal is based upon
ill health and an inability to make a can
vass of the State. Primaries held within
the last week or ten days In about a
dozen counties had given Bailey a lead In
the race. The announcement of Senator
Chilton's withdrawal was made by his
campaign manager.
Tennessee Populists Quarrel.
NASHVILLE. Term., April 17.âPopu
lists of Tennessee met here to-day in
State convention and engaged in a stormy
session. After much talk it was decided
to send delegates to the middle-of-the
road national convention at Cincinnati.
When this decision was reached ex-Gov
ernor John P. Buchanan retired from the
meeting. The resolutions adopted renew
allegiance to the Omaha platform of 18W
and to the amplifications; of 1896. The
delegates to the national convention at
Cincinnati go uninstructed.

AUSTIN. Tex., April 17.â Colonel W. J.

WATER COMPANY SUED.
San Diego Consumers Object to Extra
Charge for Pumping.
SAN DIEGO, April 17.â The. contest of
water consumers to compel the San Diego
Flume Company to furnish them water in
dry years by pumping on their contracts
for irrigating water without an extra
charge for pumping, water where It is
found impossible to supply it from storage
reservoirs has culminated to-day in an ac
tion in Department No. 1 of the Superior
Court brought by attorneys for certain
water consumers in El Cajon Valley ask
ing that the San Diego Flume Company
show cause why a receiver should not be
appointed for their extensive system of
water works which were built about eight
years ago and which is fifty-five miles
long and cost over $2,000,000. The company
has three reservoirs and thirty-six mllea
of flume and about fifteen miles of pipe
line. Â¦ i'V-V;-;
It has contracts with consumers which
specify that In years of normal shortage
of rainfall the water supply shall be pro
portionately reduced. During the last two
years practically no storage has been
made on account of light rainfall and tho
company has Installed pumps and dug
wells in the San Diego River to keep trees
alive, charging for this. extra water, how
ever, 5 to IVt cents per thousand. gallons.
The . consumers object to paying, hence
they ask a receiver. The court required
the petitioners to file a bond of $500 and
if this is done the- case will be heard on
April 27. . -Â¦- Â¦ -.

JAPAN VIEWS
RUSSIA'S COURSE
WITH DISTRUST
Places No Confidence in the
Assurances From St.
Petersburg.
Ready to Oppose by Force of Arms
tha Attempt of the Czar to
Obtain a Foothold in
Korea.
Â«
Correspondence of the Associated Press
YOKOHAMA, March 31.â 1f the quick
and 6teady dispatch of telegrams from
Korea means aught of a really serious na
ture the Inference would be that Japan
and Russia are on the verge of a war.
Outwardly, however, there Is absolute
calm, and the tone of the press Is but
slightly bellicose. The prevalent opinion
of the foreign community seems to be that
as the conflict is Inevitable the sooner it
occurs the better it will be for Japan. The
latter, with her great fleet, far superior to
that of her enemy in these waters, would
make short work of Russia's naval force
and command the situation, for the time
at least, with all the advantage which an
added prestige would confer.
But, as in all such crises, in view of
what modern war Is now known to entail,
there is extreme reluctance on the part of
either Government to take the decisive
step. If It were not for the deep-seated
distrust of Russian methods of aggran
dizement, of which she has furnished so
many object lessons of late, Japan would
be strongly inclined to put up with the
"assurances" given, that "there Is nothing
In the demands upon Korea inimical to
Japanese Interests." But the Japanese
have been and are keen students of Rus
sian history, and they know what her
gaining of a foothold means. They know
that a foothold 'In Korea means the ulti
mate passing of the peninsula under Rus
sian sway, and this nation in a unit for
fighting to the death against that en
croachment. Other powers may ask Korea
for concessions and leases ad libitum, but
Russia has too often shown her hand and
her plain intent for Japan to trust to any
of her "assurances."
It may. therefore, easily be that the
question will be put to the arbitrament of
war at any moment. All that Russia de
mands now is a concession of .territory
near Masampo, or. as alternative, the Isl
and of Kotoku. Either would be a stand-
Ing menace to Japan, and one of the
toughest of diplomatic fights is now on at
Seoul. Russia Is making some attempts
In the way of a naval demonstration, as
she did "at the close of the Japan-China
war, but it Is a sorry show now compared
with the magnificent fleet which Japan
has most opportunely assembled for the
spring maneuvers. It Is deemed by many
to be significant that the whereabouts and
movements of this fleet of sixty vessels
are veiled In the greatest secrecy. That
they will be within easy striking distance
of the scene of war may easily be sur
mised.
Roth of the Westchester County delega
tions were given seats in the convention,
with half votes each. Ex-Congressman
Lemuel E. Quigg was made chairman of
the committee on resolutions. The usual
resolution to refer all resolutions to the
committee without discussion was adopt
ed. Quigg arose to offer a resolution re
lating to the committee on resolutions
when some one called for three cheers.
The cheers began feebly, but in an Instant
from the galleries and the side of the hall
came hisses, which drowned the cheers.
The chairman finally rapped the disturb
ers to order, closing the unpleasant in
cident. After the appointment of com
mittees the convention took a recess until
4 p m.
The afternoon session of the convention
was much more enthusiastic. The com
mittee on permanent organization report
ed the name of Congressman James S.
Sherman of Oneida for permanent chair
man. His allusions to McKinley were re
ceived with applause, but the mention of
Roosevelt created a whirlwind of excite
ment' and his declaration that Roosevelt
must have a second term as Governor
brought the audience to its feet with
cheers and handelapplngs. Mention of
McKinley and Roosevelt, not evidently in
tended to ticket the two names, caused
another burst of enthusiasm and evident
ly hurt the feelings of the Woodruff men,
for at the conclusion of the chairman's
speech they started cheering for their
candidate, which was joined in by the
delegates from Queens and Suffolk coun
ties and was checked only by a demon
stration of disapproval on the part of the
other delegates.
The Platform.
The usual lists of vice presidents and
secretaries were read, and then Lemuel
E. Quigg of New York was called to the
stage to read the platform. He was re
ceived with mingled hisses and applause.
Qulgg waited until the noise had sub
sided and then read the platform, which
was adf.'jJted.
The platform congratulates the, country
"that the pledges on the faith of which
McKinlcy and Hobart were elected four
years apo have been redeemed." It in
dorses the administrations of President
McKlnley and of Governor Roosevelt. It
asserts that the Republican party found
the country after four years of Demo
cratic government paralyzed as to indus
try, weak in trade and commerce and im
povcrit-'Jied, In Its public treasury. The
platform extols Republican party govern
ment as "equally effective and intelligent
in war as in peace."
The policy of this Government with re
gard to the status of "Spain's conquered
colfinial possessions" is approved as char
acteristically American, the platform con
tinuing:
The independence of Cuba, pledged to Cuba
and proclaimed to the world In the declaration
of war. has bf-cn secured and advanced by
every public act. The American military force.
In Cuba has been reduced. Local government
has been established and steps are now being
taken for popular elections in Cuba to erect
there a free government of the Cuban people,
preparatory to the complete withdrawal â¢ of
American authority.
In Porto Rico, which has become for all time
American territory, civil irovernment and lib
eral laws have been provided. . '.
The Insurrection In the Philippine Islands has
been overcome, organized rebellion no longer
exists and the establishment of American au
thority In all the Islands Is proceeding to the
contentment of their Inhabitants.
The list of electors, delegates at large
and electors at large was read and ap-
S roved without change. The names â¢of
Ir. Platt, Mr. Depew, Governor Roose
velt and Mr. Odell were received with
applause.

REPUBLICANS
OF NEW YORK
IN CONVENTION
Delegates at Large to the
Philadelphia Gathering
Elected.
Leaders Undecided as to Whether to
Give Roosevelt a Second Term
or Urge Him for the Vice
Presidency.
*
NEW YORK, April 17.â The Republican
Convention for the election of delegates
at-large to the national convention at
Philadelphia named two United States
Senators, a Governor and the second in
command of the Republican State organ
ization as their choice for delegates-at-
Jargc. Then it complimented the_newspa
pcr profession by naming as ok-ctors-at
large! the proprietor of a Buffalo news
paper and the proprietor and editor of a
Rochester newspaper.
The men thus signally honored were:
United States Senator Thomas C. Platt,
United Starts Senator C. M. Depew. Gov
ernor Roosevelt and State Committee
Chairman B. B. Odcll as delegates-at
large, and Edward H. Butler of Buffalo
and F. A. Mitchell of Rochester as
electors-at-!arge.
Thejjconventioh 'was not enthusiastic at
rts morning session, but was demonstrat
ive at its afternoon cessiua-'lt had few
spectators when it met at noon and a
good gathering when it met in the late
afternoon. It demonstrated that so far
as individual delegates went they were
not quite decided in their- prfeference as
to whether Governor Roosevelt should be
a .candid;Â»tÂ« for Governor or for Vice
President; whether they wanted T. L.
Woodruff fcr Lieutenant Governor again
or for Vice President. When the tem
porary and permanent chairman an
nounced the candidacy of Governor
Roosevelt for a second term the conven
tion went wild with enthusiasm, but when
Mr. Sherman coupled the names of Mc-
Klnley and Roosevelt the applause and
enthusiasm were Ftill greater. So it wasÂ«
Impossible to diagnose the attitude of the
majority of the delegates toward the Gov
ernor.
It .Is believed, however, that the gen
eral trend is toward the renomination of
Roosevelt and the pushing of Woodruff
for second place on the national ticket.
The convention had the unique distinc
tion of having no business for the com
mittee on contested seats to perform, and
of having no interruption of the pro
gTamnie laid out by the organization.
Second Term for Roosevelt.
13. B. Odell Jr., chairVnan of the State
Committee, called the convention to or
der, and the Rev. Dr. David R. Burrell
of the Marble Collegiate Church delivered
an invocation. State Senator N.-A. Els
"berg of New York City was *nade tem
porary chairman.-, and JiddteEsed the con
vention at some length, dwelling upon the
ability with which the State and national
governments had been administered by
Governor Roosevelt and President McKin
ley respectively. Speaking of Governor
Roosevelt. Mr. Elsbergsaid:
New Terk will make no sarrlflce of him a*
vet at any rate, and not until the Slate has
had another term of Roosevejt as if Governor
will rhe relinquish htm to what we hope are
higher honors etlll In store. ;
ThU declaration was "greeted with en

native language and songs, customs

every tribe that inhabits the northeast
ern section of the vast country of Sibe
ria. Buxton will confine his work
mainly to the zoological field, toward
making a new and rare collection of
birds and mammals for the big mu
seum In Central Park. "While the out
lined plan of this expedition is of keen
Interest to the scientific world at large,
still it sinks into insignificance when
the novel and dangerous nature of the
trip of these men is considered. Start
ing from Vladisvostok in August, they
will strike north into absolutely un
known regions, and will practically
bury themselves for a period of two or
three years. Bogaras will come out on
the other side of the world, as it were,
for after reaching a far north line of
latitude he will turn eastward and
work almost to European Russia,
meeting his comrades some years hence
in New York City. Jochelson travels
up the coast toward East Cape, on the
Bering Sea. . Buxton goes Inland and
then cuts north also.' Some time in the
fall of 1901 they expect to meet in the
East Cape region and there await the
coming of the whaling fleet. Failing in
this, it is with remarkable fortitude
that they stated the wait for easier
transportation southward would be a
year longer. The expedition Is pro
visioned for two years.
Bogaras and Jochelson took their ap-
THHEE MEN WHO WILL EXPLORE THE WILDS OF NORTHERN SIBERIA.
ON the steamer Doric that sailed for
Hongkong via Honolulu were three
men who compose the Jessup ex
pedition, sent by the American Mu
seum of Natural History of New York
City to explore the unknown country
of Northeastern Siberia. They were
two Russians of scientific and literary
renown in their own country named
Waldemar Bogaras and Waldemar
Jochelson and the famous young Amer
ican scientist, Norman C. Buxton, a
graduate of Stanford University in the
class of '05.
The work cut out for the expedition
is little short of stupendous, and is
fraught with interest that always at
taches Itself to exploration In the
frozen North. Two years ago Presi
dent Jessup of the American Museum,
a New York millionaire, appropriated
J50.000 for the purpose of solving the
race question of the Arctic zone. Three
Eastern collectors worked over the
Alaskan Held for a winter season and
provided, the museum with valuable
ethnological data concerning the hab
its, customs and language of the na
tlves,' % all tending to enlighten the
world of science as to whether the red
man of America Is a descendant of
Asiatic stock or vice versa.
Deductions from recent information
obtained on the American side point
toward the latter theory. So the work
of Bogaras, Jochelson and Buxton will
furnish data, to complete. the chain.
The Russians will touch mainly upon
prentlceshlp In Eastern Siberian ex
ploration" while exiles under the ban
of the Czar for the publication of lit
erature which strongly advocated the
freedom of the press along American
ideas. Ten years was the sentence to
the Arctic Siberian coast, the latter
period of which was put to a useful
study of the natives along ethnologi
cal lines. Their work attracted the
attention of the members of the great
St. Petersburg Museum and they were
returned and restored to a place of fa
vor in the Russian scientific world.
Bogaras contributes to six magazines
of his country on sociological subjects
and is a clever writer of short stories.
Jochelson has written a work on nat
ural history, which was well received
throughout all of Europe. Their for
mer Siberian study won them a place
on the Jessup expedition. Norman C.
Buxton, who graduated from Stanford
five years ago. made his reputation
with the Smithsonian expedition at
Point Barrow in ISO 7 and 1593. He has
since lectured in the Eastern States
and is recognized as the most brilliant
of the youns American zoologists.
Â¦ Appreciating the progression and Im
portance of the work planned by the
New York Society, the Russian Gov
ernment has placed every facility be
fore the expedition to aid in attaining
results. Throuph passports are pro
vided the members and two Cossacks
will accompany each man. Even the
Russian punboats that patrol the
eastern coast of Siberia will be placed
at their disposal.

OF PLACERVILLE
REORGANIZED
Election Held' for the First
Time in Twenty-Eight
Years.
Prentiss Carpenter Is Chosen Mayor
and the Settlement of the Bond

Upon Him.
. .
Special Ditratch to The Call.
PLACERVILLE, -April 17.â The first
municipal election held In this city
since the resignation of the Mayor
and common Council twenty-eight
years ago took place to-day. Much
Interest was taken in it, as the purpose
of the city's reorganization is to settle
the railroad bonds which have long over
hung the city, and the attempted collec
tion of which caused the resignation of
the city officers. Each voter was required
to write the names of the persons for
whom he voted, as the vacancies in the
city offices, with whom certificates â¢of
nomination are required to be filed, pre
vented the names of. candidates * being
printed on a ticket.
Premiss Carpenter, a native of this city
and a talented attorney, who has been
twice District Attorney of the county,
was elected Mayor without opposition.
Mr. Carpenter is able and progressive and
it is believed he will make an Ideal Mayor.
A spirited contest for most of the other
offices resulted as follows: Clerk and As
sessor, W. M. Muffley; Marshal, Oswald

PAYS TOO MUCH
FOR THE ARMOR
FOR ITS SHIPS
Wheeler of Kentucky De
clares the Government Is
Being Robbed.
Says Manufacturers Realize Two
Hundred Per Cent Profit on
Their Contracts With
Uncle Sam.
?
WASHINGTON, April 17.â The second
day's debate upon the naval appropria
tion bill in the House to-day was con
fined closely to the subject matter of the
bill and was as a rule devoid of interest
ing features. The questions of armor
plate and the building of warships in Gov
ernment yards, as on yesterday, attracted
most attention. The general debate was
closed to-day and to-morrow the bill will
be read under the Jive-minute rule.
Dayton of West Virginia opposed the
building of warships in Government
yards. Wheeler of Kentucky asked if
there was not a lobby to defeat the prop
osition to build ships in Government
yards.
"I never heard of such a lobby." replied
Dayton. "The only lobby I have seen was
the lobby of naval constructorsâ lf it
could be called a lobbyâ arguing in favor
of the proposition I oppose."
Dayton also opposed the establishment
of a Government plate factory. The Gov
ernment had as well go into production
of any other production which it must
buy.
Wheeler concluded the debate for the
day. He criticized severely the rule of
the House which prohibited members
from making public on the floor what was
done and said behind committee doors,
and declared himself in favor of compell
ing committees to open their doors to the
press. The most vicious legislation was
hatched behind closed; doors. He had no
insinuation to make, against the Naval
Committee, of which 'he was a member,
he said, but he thought the practice a bad
one. \
He also ..opposed; he said, the appoint
ment of men with special interests to
serve on committees. Their desire to
serve their constituents outweighed their
duty to their country.
Â¦\\ heeler said he was opposed on con
viction to a Government armor plate fac
tory and the building of ships in Govern
ment yards, but when it came to surren
dering some of his convictions or submit
ting to highway robbery he would let
some of the former go. He was convinced
from what he had been able to learn that
the profit on armor plate was from 150 to
200 per cent. Wheeler said he had in his
possession a letter to prove that Krupp
armor could be produced cheaper than
Harveyized armor, but he was not at lib
erty to use it.
Wheeler created something of a sensa
tion by expressing the opinion that an
officer in the uniform of the United States
"was responsible for the armor plate
trust." He did not name the officer and
was not questioned as to whom he meant.

MRS. FENNELL FREED
OF KIDNAPING CHARGE
Her ex-Husband Failed to Appear
and Justice James Dismissed
the Case.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, April 17.â Mrs. Amanda
J. Fiske-Marceau-Fennell can now return
to San Francisco minus the felony charge
of kidnaping her boy, Theodore Marceau
Jr., that has hung over her since April 1,
when she was removed from the north
bound train at Bakersfield through a war
rant sworn to by her former husband. As
has been foreshadowed in these dis
patches, the attorneys for Mrs. Marceau,
Senator White and C. N. Pendleton, pre
pared for a desperate fight to have this
charge removed, so that the hearing, that
is set for April 23 before Judge Troutt,
would not be colored by any other feature.
At 2 o'clock this afternoon Justice
James, at the request of the District At
torney, dismissed the charge. Mrs. Mar
ceau and her witnesses were present.
Colonel Marceau was absent, so were the
witnesses and attorneys for the prosecu
tion. The non-appearance of Colonel Mar
ceau after he has exhausted every scheme
to oppress and humiliate his former wife
Is the subject of much comment. Colonel
Marceau demanded every exaction that
the law could devise that would prevent
the mother from seeing her child, and
through his attorneys last Thursday inti
mated that he feared, unless he be per
mitted to retain possession of the child,
further safeguards for Its protection
should be created.
It is rumored to-night that Colonel Mar
ceau Is in San Francisco â that he secretly
departed Sunday or Monday so that he
would not be again compelled to go on the
witness stand to face the woman he had
charged with a felony. Mrs. Marceau. who
will leave Los Angeles to-morrow or
Thursday for San Francisco, is determined
to wage a battle for her child that will
cause Colonel Marceau to know that he is
on earth.

THE IDOL OF THE TURF.
The Most Popular Jockey in America
and England Recommends Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets.
No jockey has ever appealed so strongly
to public favor as Tod Sloan.
He has achieved more than his most
noted predecessors ever attempted and
stands in a class by himself.
Not satisfied with his successes in his
native country, he went to England and
now his fame as a successful horseman is
on the tip of every tongue not only in
this country and England, but in every
section of the globe where racing has
found favor.
When Tod first went to England his
temerity was openly laughed at, but the
little American played skittles with his
English rivals and his victories made all
England gasp.
Having the stamp of royal approval, so-
ciety both at home and abroad "lionize"
him and he is feted and petted to an ex-
tent that would turn an ordinary mortal's
head.
The great Jockey was in such demand
socially and dined and wined to such an
extent that It was feared his health
would give way. Too much society and
the nervous strain of racing told on him.
A two weeks' trip to America made him
acquainted with Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets and their remarkably restorative
effects on, a depleted digestive apparatus
and he recommended them In ] unstinted
terms to a friend, saying. "Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets are the best thing I know
of for keeping the stomach In condition
and appetite in good repair."
Thousands of former dyspeptics can
vo"uch for the truth of Tod Sloan's words,
as "Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets" have be-
come a household word in. America and
few families are without them. One or
two taken after meals keep the stomach
sweet by causing prompt and healthy di-
gestion of the food.
Perfectly healthy people use them after
heavy dinners, to keep their good health
and to make sure that no ill effects will
follow an unusually hearty meal.
Your druggiÃt will tell you or your doc-
tor either that Btuart'B DyÃpepsia Tablets
are composed only of digestive ferments,
Asceptic Pepsin, HydraÃtis, fruit acids,
etc.. and for the strong stomach as well
as the moat : delicate constitute a safe-
guard against Indigestion and stomach
troubles. HHfi

MRS. BRASH
FILES SUIT FOR
MAINTENANCE
Claims Her Husband Has
Failed to Support Her
and Their Child.
He Has Been Known as a "Jolly
Good Fellow" and the Couple
Have Valuable Commu
nity Property.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, April 17.â A suit that will
come as a surprise to San Jose society
was begun here to-day by Mrs. Georgi
ana Braslan against her husband, Charles
P. Braslan, for maintenance. Braslan is a
well-known seedsman and during the past
two years of his residence here has cut
a wide swath because of his generosity
among the young bloods and business
men, while his wife is well known in
society.
The couple were married in ISDI in Chi
cago and have a child 6 years old. Ac
cording to the complaint iiled by Attor
ney J. E. Richards this afternoon, Bras
lan deserted his wife last October, and
while he has been a jolly good fellow with
his friends on the street, he has refused
to furnish support for his wife and child.
Everybody supposed the couple lived
happily, and the suit is a great surprise.
For the past few months Braslan has
been in the East and a few weeks ago he
returned to San Francisco.
Mrs. Braslan wants 5150 per month for
her maintenance. It is. said there is com
munity property valued at $20,000.
Braslan is one of the best-known seeds
men in the United States. For a number
of years he was at the head of a large
seed firm in Chicago and had many con
tracts with the Agricultural Department
for furnishing Government seeds. A few
years ago the firm failed and he came to
California, locating here. When the
Union Bank failed, as representative of
the Union Trust Company, he tried to se
cure a place on the Board of Directors,
but failed. He afterward appealed to the
courts, but lost. He is deeply interested
in seed growing in this State and last
year, with Charles Parker of Santa Clara,
obtained the Government contract for
supplying seeds to the Agricultural De
partment. >-.::Â¦Â¦â¢'..Â¦-Â¦
HOAR APPEALS
TO HIS PARTY.
Urges a Complete Abandonment
of the Movement Toward
Imperialism.
Venerable Massachusetts Senator's Plea for
Adherence to the Cherished Ideals
of the Republic.
i_ Â¦
/WASHINGTON. April 17.â For more
â¢than thn-e hours to-d.iy Hoar, the senior
Senator from Massachusetts. occupied
the attention of the Senate with a speech
In opposition to the policy of "imperial-
Ism," upon which he maintained this Gov
ernment had embarked. As prepared, the
address was fifty thousand words In
length, but Hoar omitted much of It ow
ing to an incipient attack of the grippe,
from which he was suffering. He spoke
for three hours, and while It was a tre
mendous strain on him, the more Impor
tant paragraphs of the argument were
delivered with force and vi^or.
The speech was brlllianny written, was
illuminated with splendid rhetorical fig
ures and was rich with citations from his
tory. One of the notable parts of the ad
dress was the eulogy of Aguinaldo. Hoar
did not liken the insurgent leader to
Washington, as has been done heretofore,
but to Kossuth, Oom Paul, Joubert, Na
than Hale and other builders of the
church of liberty. In statecraft he liken
ed Aguinaldo and his associates In the
leadership of the Filipinos to the best
minds ever produced in the Asiatic race â
a race which handed* down to us "the
scriptures of the old and new testaments,
the poetry of David, the eloquence of j
Isaiah," the wisdom of Solomon and the j
profound philosophy of St. Paul."
One of the most effective parts of the j
address was his fancied roilcall of some ;
of the distinguished statesmen of the j
United States on the question of the re- ;
tention of the Philippines. He began with ;
George Washington and closed with Wil- ;
liara McKlnley, each in a sentence giving j
the reason for his vote. Every vote was !
la the negative except that of Aaaron !
Burr, who voted "yes," and said:
"You are repeating my buccaneering
expedition down the Mississippi. I am to ;
be vindicated at last."
When the name of William McKlnley j
was called he replied:
"There has betii a cloud before my vis- j
ion for a moment, but I see clearly now; !
1 eo back to what I said two years ago: j
"Forcible annexation is criminal aggres- :
sion: Governments derive their just power I
Irom the consent of the governed â not j
tome of them, but all of them.' I will ;
stand with the fathers of the republic. I
will stand with the founders of the Re
publican party. No."
The effect was dramatic. As Hoar pro
nounced his peroration the stillness In the
chamber was intense. Applause swept j
over the galleries, but it was hushed j
quick, y by the President pro tern.
Protests Against Empire.
Hoar took for his text the resolution of
Beveridge of Indiana, declaring that the
Philippine Islands are territory belonging |
t.. the United States, and that the United I
States Government must govern the Â¦
archipelago. He requested his colleagues !
not to interrupt him in the course of his i
Fpeech, indicating that the state of his i
health rendered it undesirable that he j
should enter into a running debate.
Hoar began by speaking of the prosper- ]
oua condition of the American people at i
the- close of the war with Spain. He told '<
at the clary of the conflict and of the \
victory in the interest of liberty. He [
j<r::is<-d President McKinley's course at j
shat time, saying that, in his Judgment. ',
he was the best beloved President who j
ever sat in the chair at Washington. Con
tinuing, he said:
The American people, eo far as I know. Â¦
were a!l agreed that their victory brought
v;Â»h It the responsibility of protecting the
inint*i& - peoples Â» from the cupidity of an7 I
otter ;."\v*-r until they could establish their I
ov.n in^ptridenee in freedom und In honor.
I Etand here to-day to plead with you not i
to abandon the principle* that have brought '
tboae th'.n&s *o pass. I Implore you to keep :
tu the policy that has made the country great.
â¢. :.;t has made the Republican party treat, that .
lias rr.a'lo the President great. If. when we
jr.ade the treaty of peace, we had adhered to
the purpose we declared when we declared
var; if we !.a<3 deaJt with the Philippine |
I^iand? as we deal, have dealt and expect to
d~.-ii with Cuba, we would have escaped the ,
ltÂ«* of SOW brave soldiers and other thousands
Of wrecked and shattered lives and the expendi
ture of hundreds of millions, and. what Is far ]
worse than a!!, the trampling under foot of â¢
our cherished Ideals.
I <5o not c-xpect to accomplish anything for â¢
liberty [a the Philippine Islands except through ;
the Republican party. Upon it the fate of
tbeae island* for years to come Is to depend, j
I cannot took with any favor on Mr. Bryan as :
an alternative.
I believe not only that perseverance in the !
present policy will be the abandonment of the ;
principles upon which our Government Is i
founded, that It will chanre our republic into
tn empire, that cur methods of legislation, of
diplomacy, erf administration, must hereafter
lie thi.'se which bejonr to empires and not those
which belong to republics; but I believe per
pistence '.n this attempt will result in the
<Jfath and overthrow of the Republican party.
The Expansion of Despotism.
Touching upon the constitutionality of
the question at issue, Mr. Hoar said:
I hold that this acquisition of territory held- '
lr.i? and jrmem'.r.g. "an be or.ly the means for !
a constitutional end. And I maintain that
you can no more held and covem territory
than you can hold and manage cannon or Ceets
for any other than a constitutional end.
Hoar then traversed the constitutional
and international field of the Philippine
controversy, covering much of the sam<Â»
ground hÂ«Â» and others have covered here- I
tofoTf in the pending Cisrufsion.
Adverting to the authority toi be found j
in the Declaration of Independence for ex
pansion. Hoar declared:
There Is expansion enough in It, but It Is the
expansion of freedom and not of despotism; of
life, not of death. Never was euch growth in
all human history as that from the seed
Thomas Jefferson planted. It ha* covered the
continent. It has taken In South America. It
Is revolutionizing Europe. It Is the expansion
of freedom. It differs from your tinsel, plnch
beek. pewter expansion as the growth of a
healthy youth Into a strong man differs from
the expansion of an anaconda when he swal
lows his victim. Ours Is the expansion of
Thomas Jefferson. Yours Is the expansion of
Aaron Burr. It Is destined to as short a life
and to a like fate. In every accession of ter
ritory to this country ever made we recognized
fully the doctrine of consent of the governed
and the doctrine that territory so acquired
must be had to be made into States.
Tou have tried governing men of other races
than your own at home for a hundred years.
You have dealt with the Indian, you have dealt
with the negro, clone at hand, knowing all
about them. And now you go forth to lay
your yoke on ten millions of them. I suppose
you feel encouraged by your success. There are
ten millions more, seven thousand miles away,
of whom you know nothing. You go forth
Jauntily and txiastlngly, as Louis Napoleon
went to meet his doom at Sedan.
Hoar discussed at great length the Fili
pino rebellion and the causes which, in his
opinion, led up to it. He made an earnest
and vigorous defense of the Filipinos, es
pecially of Aguinaldo, who. he declared,
was "brave, honest and patriotic." In the
course of his eulogy of Ag~ulnaldo he said:
He deserves to be remembered with that
small band who have given life and everything
dearer than life to their country In a losing
cause. He shall live with Kossuth, with Oom
Paul, with Joubert, with Emmet, with Eg
mont and Horn, with Nathan Hale, with War
ren, with all the great martyrs of history
whose blood has been the seed of the Church
of Liberty.
Hoar maintained his well-known posi
tion that the Filipinos had achieved their
independence; that the United States had
made them its ally and was bound to rec
ognize their Independence, and that they
had proved themselves fit for such Inde
pendence and capable of self-government.
As one bit of proof of their statecraft he
declared:
The Ftate papers of Agulnaldo, the discussion
of the law of nations by his attorney general,
the masterly appeal of Mabini, are products
of the Asiatic mind. They are not unworthy
of the Asiatic mind, the vehicle through which
came to us the Scriptures of the Old and New
Testament, the poetry of David, the eloquence
of Isaiah, the wisdom of Solomon, the pro
found philosophy of Paul.
Our Duty to the Filipinos.
The Senator presented an elaborate de
fense of the Filipinos against the charge
that they were responsible for the present
war, jpstifying their action in resisting
the American forces.
As an illustration of what he would do
with the Philippines, Hoar said:
I would declare that we would not take these
Islands to govern them against their will.
I would reject a cession of sovereignty which
implied that sovereignty may be bought and
pold and delivered without the consent of the
people.
I would require all foreign Governments to
keep out of these islands.
I would offer to the people of the Philippines
our help In maintaining order until they have
a reasonable opportunity to establish a Gov
ernment of their own.
I would aid them by advice. If they desire
It. to Bet up a free and independent Govern
ment.
I would Invite all the great powers of Europe
to unite in an agreement that that Independence
shall not be interfered with.
I woi:M declare that the United States will
enforce the fame doctrine as applicable to the
Philippines ..that we declared as "to Mexico and
Heyti anl the South American republic*.
I would then, in a not distant future. lÂ«ave
them to work out their own salvation, an every
nation on earth s'nee the beginning of time has
wrought out its own salvatir n.
In the course of his remarks Hoar
quoted a paragraph from a recent speech
of Tillman of South Carolina, in which
the latter said that the people of the South
hnd shot negroes, stuffed ballot-boxes and
finally had taken from the negro the
rights granted by the fourteenth and fif
teenth amendments. Tillman rose to in
terrupt him. but Hoar declined to yield,
paying:
I have alluded to the Senator from South
Carolina only to quote his own words and to
pay that he Is beyond all question one of the
most powerful an 3 conspicuous leaders of the
Democratic party. I take it that the Senator
dr>Â»Â« not consider that as an aspersion.
(Laughter.)
Hoar spoke for three hours and ten min
utes. As he concluded applause swept
over the galleries. Many of his colleagues
especially those on the Democratic side)
congratulated him.

SHIPPERS MUST
PAY THE WAR TAX
Text of Supreme Court Decision
From Which Justices Harlan
and McKenna Dissent.
Special Dispatch to the Call
CALL HEADQUARTERS. WELLINGTON HOTEL. WASHINGTON. April
17.â The Supreme Court of the United States yesterday decided that express com
panies may add the price of the one-cont stamp required to be affixed to their
receipts for shipment of goods to the rates charged for transportation. There
were two cases before the court, the opinion being delivered In that of the Ameri
can Express Company vs. F. A. Maynard. Attorney General, on relation of
George F. Aloore and five other citizens of Michigan.
The latter brought suit for a writ of mandamus against the express company
to prohibit It from adding the price of the stamp to the rates in existence, aver
ring that they were Just and reasonable, but would be rendered unjust and un
reasonable if the price of the stamp were added to them. It waa also claimed
that the war revenue act Imposed the duty of affixing the stamp upon the ex
press company and that it could not be shifted to another. The express com
pany answered that no duty was imposed on it to furnish and affix the stamp by
act of Congress, but if it were the matter was left optional or open to contract
between the company and Its customers.
The Supreme Court of Michigan decided that it was the duty of the company
to furnish the stamps; that it was not optional nor open to contract; that the
rates put in force by the company were a subterfuge to evade the law and that
the company was forbidden to increase its rates. It declared the increased rato
illegal and made the mandamus permanent, and the express company appealed.
Justice White announced the decision of the United States Supreme Court,
discussing at some length the terms and effect of the war revenue act. He con
cluded that there was no intimation in the act that the ultimate burden of the tax
must rest on the company. If that were the case, he said, the act would not only
be a tax law, but would regulate every transaction possible In human society
under it. Every tax act, he continued, would destroy the power of contract, the
freedom of human transaction and regulate the cost of production and the price
of labor. The court could not agree that rates Just and reasonable couM be
rendered unjust and unreasonable by the addition of the tax. The judgment of
the Michigan Supreme Court was reversed and the case remanded.
In the case of William Crawford vs. the treasurer of the Adams Express
Company on a certificate from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, the court
answered in the negative the question, "Is an express company precluded by the
war revenue act from relieving itself of the expense of affixing and canceling
stamps required to be attached to receipts?"
Justices Harlan and McKenna dissented, holding that the act Imposed the
duty of affixing stamps upon receipts and that the question of shifting the bur
den was one to be decided by the State courts. They approved the judgment of
the Michigan court.

FIRST CHOICES
BROKE EVEN AT
TANFORAN PARK
Rollick and Sardine Managed
to Strike in Very
Soft Spots.
There was nothing strikingly out of the
common about the racing at Tanforan
Park yesterday. Three favorites jogged
In first, while a like number were counted
out. Little Ranch continued his good sad
dle work by piloting three winners.
The hardy Burns & Waterhouse young:-
Fter Rollick fell in with a mediocre bunch
In the "opening dash, winning as he
pleased at odds of 3 to o. Ada N took the
place from Carllee.
A big bunch of sixteen celling platers
lined up in the five and a half-furlong
pprtnt following, with Genua ruling a 9 to
f. choice. The favorite broke first, and
after leading throughout won hard ridden
from Don Luis, a 15 to 1 chance. Beau
monde. at long odds, ran into the show.
An Hl-aFsorted cluster of three-year-old
maidens faced the barrier in the third
number, with Young Morello ruling a 17
to 10 choice. Little Ranch astride Ed
pardo, a 5 to 1 chance, quickly showed
first, and was eased up In front of St.
Oermaln and Reginald Hughes at the
Â¦wire. The latter was disqualified and the
show jrlven to the favorite.
Jockey Powell's alertness in leaving the
post In the mile celling run with Maydlne
undoubtedly gave him the race. Never
headed, the bay filly downed Tizona, the
contender throughout, half a length In a
rlow run affair. Prestome seemed full of
run until Morgan let him down, when he
died away apparently.
Corrigan's Sardine, thrown In with a
quartet of cheap ones in the fifth recital,
â¢walked in first at odds of 3 to 10. Imp
Mistral lost the place to Rapido by a
head.
Mary Kinsclla, second choice in the
rinjr. cut out the running in the lai<t and
beat Ace a head on the wire. The favor-
He, Fashion Plate, was unplaced.
Track Notes.
Jockey Morgan was indefinitely sus
pended for a ride on Prestome that did
rot suit the Judges. Magrane'e horse is
a very cheap and uncertain piece of rac
ing hardware to test a boy"s honesty on.

TOMMY WHITE
GIVES McGOVERN
A HARD TUSSLE
Goes Six Fast Rounds and
Has the Better of It
in the Last
CHICAGO. April 17.â Tommy White of
Chicago went six fast rounds with Terry
McGovern of Brooklyn to-night, finished
strong and had the better of the last
round. The fight was at 130 pounds, both
men being below that, although the exact
weights were not given out. McGovern
did not from appearances have more than
two or three pounds the worst of the
weight.
By an agreement of the principals no
decision was to be rendered if both men
were on their feet at the end of the sixth
round. McGovern probably would have
received the decision if one had been ren
dered, as he was en the aggressive from
start to finish. White keeping very largely
on the defensive. He at times took the
aggressive and jabbed McGovern in the
most clever manner with his left.
Though McGovern set a terrific pace In
the opening round. White was very cool
and confident. In one of Terry's rushes
Tommy went to the fioor from a hard ieft
on the head. White took the limit, but
came up strong. A moment later McGov
ern swung ri>?nt and left, missing both,
and fell to the Uoor from the force of his
blows. He was up immediately and
wrestled quite to the floor. â¢ When Tommy
came up he landed a right on Terry's ear.
A left hook on the chin dropped White
just as the gong sounded.
Terry continued to rush in the second,
and again Tommy went to the floor, Ter
ry's right and left on the face and two
lefts on the chin doing the business. In this
iound Terry put a hard left on White's
eye, breaking the skin. The wound bled
badly throughout the following rounds.
White made a better showing in the
third round, landing several blows, but
just before the bell McGovern landed a
hard right on the stomach that put White
down for a five county
Terry continued to set the pace in the
fourth round, putting in a perfect shower
of blows that kept Tommy constantly
breaking ground. At the cjose of the
round White landed a left hook on the
face, a right to the Jaw and followed with
two left jabs on Terry's mouth.
In the fifth round Terry went at his
man like a whirlwind, and though White
was staggered by the repeated swings on
his head, he -recovered and returned sev
eral hard ones. A hard right on Tommy's
nose brought blood. Then Terry Jabbed
the sore eve twice. At the bell Tommy
was bleeding badly and his seconds gave
him whisky.
McGoyern opened the closing round with
a rush, but fought wildly and missed most
of his blows. Tommy finally stood and
put a hard' left on McGovern's jaw. send-
Ing him back as he came in. McGovern
put a hard left on Tommy's mouth and a
hard right to the ribs. Then Terry rush
ed, but received a hard ripht uppercut on
the Jaw which straightened him up. Again
he rushed, but received the same dose.
He tried it again, but got another upper
cut, and the crowd cheered wildly as
Tommy jabbed the Brooklyn boy three
times with his left on the face. McGov
ern fought wildly, trying for a knockout.
Tommy rtanced out of the way and serft
Terry's head back with a stiff left and
uppercut with his right. White then Jab
bed five straight lefts to the mouth as
Terry followed him around the ring, each
time blocking Terry's wild swings. They
were clinched on '-the ropes as the bell
rang.
The crowd of SOOO persons went wild at
White's splendid showing and the build-
Ing rang with cheers at the end of every
round. At the end of the fight the crowd
went crazy with yells for White.
The betting: before the fight was 10 to 8
that White would not stay the six rounds.

RIFLEMEN STILL FAIL
TO NAME THEIR RANGE
Unable to Agree Upon the location
of the Place for the Rifle Tour
nament of Next Year. .
The delegates to the National Schuetz
enbund axe unable to agree in the matter
of selecting the range for the big rifle
tournament of 1901. Captain Fred Schu
man of Schuetzen Park range and Captain
L. Siobe of Shell Mound both bid for the
tournament. Each promised to make the
necessary alterations ln'their premises. To
each proposition there was an objection
In the case of the San Rafael range the
distance from San Francisco was too
great and too much time would be lost
in traveling. In the case of Shell Mound
the park has been rented to a Scottish
organization for the Fourth of Julyâ the
middle of the tournament. However, the
proprietor of each range has his friends in
the bund, and pressure has been brought
to bear upon the delegates.
A short time ago the Marin County Rifle
Club Was organized, and came Into the
bund about the same time the San Jose
Rifle Club sent- Its delegates. This gave
those in favor of SchueUen Park a small
majority. However, the Shell Mound con
tingent was not asleep, and the Columbia
Pistol and Rifle Club, which once with
drew its delegates because the business of
the bund was transacted in the German
language, wai Induced to renew its affilia
tion. The bund met recently and the mat
ter of selecting the park was dlaoussed
and flnallv voted upon. There were two
ballots taken, resulting In a tie of 27 to 27,
President R. Finking did not like the po
sition he was placed In and refused to cast
the deciding vote. The whole matter was
therefore postponed until the next month
ly meeting, when It must be decided.

has improved greatly.
The following communication to the
sporting editor is self-explanatory:
Spirtir.fi: Editor The Callâ My Dear Sir: Over
a week back I requested Dan Crowky, the
Columbia Club's manager, to ask the poolrooms
in this- city not to handle any money on the
contest between Young Peter Jackson and Pad
dy Purteil. I did this because there has been
bo many fake flpht* of late and I wanted to
convince the general public that Jackson was
an honest flehter. Th>> poolrooms are all right,
tut they are of no benefit to us and the sooner
they quit Belling pools on glove contests the
letter it will be Icr every fighter who is am
bltioup to become an honept ringster. Jackson
wants to fight for the gate money, not for the
pools sold, and I request the public not to Ta
per a cent on the result. If the poolrooms do
not clOFe to that contest it is then Up to the
public and by their refraining from betting
more on the content they will confer upon
Jackson and myself a favnr that will be ap
preciated. Very truly, BIDDY UISHOP,
Manager for Young Peter Jackson.

Supervisors which only permits of
one contest a month. . They were

"MYSTERIOUS"
SMITH LOSES

Yorker.
NEW YORK. April 17.â At the Broad
way Athletic Club to-night the welter
weight championship of the world

Smith to Matty Matthews of New York.
The New York man solved the hitherto
unsolvable "myÃtery" with a right-hand
punch on the Jaw in the nineteenth round,
eendlng Smith to the land of dreams. Mat
thews won from the first sound of the
gong. H6 outpointed and outgeneraled his
opponent, and although his blown were
not so hard as those of Smith, they were
cleaner and always went to the mark. The
fight was fast all the 'way and was wit
nessed by 4000 spectators, who cheered
Matthews wildly at the finish. Before the
contest the betting was lively, Smith be
ing the favorite at 100 to 80.
In the first round Matthews was forced
to the floor with a right on the kidneys,
and later went down from a clinch in his
own corner. Matthews kept leading his
left to the face, but Billy's kidney blows
had his body all raw at the close of the
fifth round. Smith kept forcing, but Mat
thews met him with stiff facers every
time. Smith was repeatedly cautioned for
unfair fighting.
When they came out for the ninth Mat
thews swung his right to the Jaw and fol
lowed with two more of the same, and
Billy began to look serious. In the elev
enth Matthews rushed and three times
landed his right on the Jaw. and both fell
to the floor In a clinch. Matthews' work
had the crowd on its feet cheering when
the bell rang. Matthews was after him
fast in the twelfth, and time and again
swung his right to the face and jaw.
Smith was bleeding from the mouth, but
fought back like a fiend and drove some
terrible rights to Matthew?' body. Left
jabs started Smith's nose bieedfng in the
thirteenth and worried him considerably.
Both landed heavily with' rights on the
head in the fourteenth, and Billy's left
eye was cut and bleeding from Matty's
jabs. Billy cut out the work in the fif
teenth and pounded Matthews hard about
the body. A left swing on the jaw and a
shove forced Matthews to the floor, but
he was right up and fighting strong.
Matthews showed the effect of Billy's
body punches In the sixteenth. He was
much slpwer and did not seem so willing
to mix it up. They went through the sev
enteenth and eighteenth with little done.
Smith having a trifle the better of it.
Smith was the aggressor in the nine
teenth, and at close quarters beat Mat
thews hard about the body. In the clinch
he threw Matty to the floor. Matthews
was up Immediately and Smith apologized
and shook hands. Matty then swung his
right to the jaw. Smith was up and
clinched. Matty threw him off and twice
more landed the same punch, the last one
dropping Smith clean. He was unable to
rise at the count and had to be carried to
his corner. Time of round, twenty-eight
seconds.

WHEELMEN ARE
REORGANIZED
ON BIG LINES
The Associated Bicyclists
Plan Much for the
Future.
Betterment of Public Highways and
the Development of Cycle
Path 3 to Be Their Chief
Objects.
The reorganization of the California As
sociated Cycling Clubs, the most repre
sentative organization of wheelmen in the
State, was effected last night in the rooms
of the Olympic Athletic Club, the new
governing body assuming the title of the
California Associated Cyclers. The or
ganization resumes its labors for the ben
eliC of wheeling under the best of au
spices. Its new officers are enthusiasts
and take up their burdens vigorously.
They will devote their energies chiefly in
the direction of legislation looking to the
betterment of the State's highways and
to the development of cycle paths wher
ever conditions will permit. The Reno
wheelmen sent a delegate all the way to
the meeting, while the Vallejo Club sent
eight representatives.
J. A. Woodson, who has done much for
the wheelmen of the State, was honored
with the presidency. His associates on
the board of officers are:
First .vice president, E. B. Learning, San
Francisco; second vice president, E. Â«. Hussey,
Vallejo; treasurer, J. J. B. Argentl. San Fran
cisco; secretary, Stanley C. Scovern. San Fran
cisco; executive committee,. Charles Albert
Adams ar.d Harry I^arkln, San Francisco.
The principal commltteemen named last
night are as follows:
Highway and Improvement committeeâ J. N.
Fitzgerald. Capitol City Wheelmen (chairman);
Morris Brooke, Seth Mann and Ferdinand Vas
eault.
llembernhlp and Inter-club relationsâ Georjre

(chairman).
Touringâ J. B. I^ambkln. Garden City Wheel
men (chairman): Samuel A. Copper, Vallejo.
Road racing and records â L. S. Upson, Sacra
mento.
Southern California wheelmen desire to
co-operate with the association If allowed
self-government. They will bo allowed a
consulate and are expected to add much
to the association. * Â¦
The annual hundred-mile relay race,
which Is one of the classic cycle competi
tions of the world, will be promoted as
usual. Strenuous efforts will be made to
eliminate pacemaklng by outside riders,
an evil which has threatened the develop
ment of the race for years.
With the Infusion of new blood in the
board of officers and a healthy revival in
cycling as a pastime, the friends of the
association look for a marked increase in
its power and usefulness. The delegates

a cluster of Chinese shacks two miles*
from Steveston. Main had been missing
since Saturday, when he went to one of
the Chinese cabins to search for some
missing tools believed to have been stolen.
He was accompanied by his dog, and
neither man nor dog was seen from Satur
day until this afternoon, when a rancher
named Trites. a member of one of many
searching parties, noticed some fresh
turned earth.
Poking with hi? stick, he felt some-re
sistance and. hastily removing the earth,
a most grewsome spectacle was revealed.
Main's head had been severed from the
body, his arms and legs were broken in
several places and the trunk was hewed
and harked into small bits. In the grave
with his master was the body of the little
dog. killed so that he might not carry
news of the crime.
Excitement in Steveston over the ghast
ly tind is intense. The town Is in an up
roar to-night. When Main was first
missed there was a general feeling that he
might have died suddenly, as he was
knpwn to have suffered from an ailment
of the heart.
Two Chinese in whose shacks were
found the stolen tools are now under ar
rest charged with the murder. They are
market gardeners, their names being Ah
Quon and Jim Chung. The third occupant
of the hut has fled and cannot be found.
Steveston Is a fishing village, where are
located thirty canneries, and during the
canning season there is a floating popula
tion of five or s=lx thousand Chinese. In
dians and Japanese.

Tim Murphy Is Tried Out.
Australian Tim Murphy is no longer a
mystery to local sporting men. He was
thoroughly tried out by Tommy Tracey
in three rounds of whirlwind fighting in
his training quarters at the Casino
yesterday afternoon. The consensus of
opinion among the spectators so fortu
natet as to be present was that he will
prove a worthy opponent for Al Neill
when they meet before the National Club
on the 27th inst. He is clever, immensely
strong, aggressive and game. He will
take a punch at any time for the chance
of landing one in return.
Competent judges of the art of attack
and defense could find but one point
against him. This was that he seemed to
leave himself open to attack. Whether
this is a real or fancied defect in his
work will only develop in active competi
tion. His bout with Tracey was not box
ing, but fighting, and the men hustled one
another about in a lively manner for
three hot rounds. .
Murphy showed at least one new blow.
In this he feints with his left for the head
and then delivers a right cross uppercut,
which he never failed to land. Murphy
is heavier than Tracey, and also has the
advantage of several weeks' training, but
his showing yesterday, even under these
conditions, stamps him as being every
inch the fighter. He showed intimate ac
quaintance with ring methods and never
lost his presence of mind.

HAWAIIAN BILL
NOW READY FOR
FINAL ACTION
House and Senate Conferees
Reach a Unanimous
Agreement.
Defeat of the Amendment Providing
for the Deportation of Asiatics
Who Flocked in Since
Annexation.
WASHINGTON. April 17.â After extend
ed meetings a unanimous agreement was
reported to-day by the House and Senate
conferees on the Hawaiian Government
bill. The Senate conferees yielded to the
House measure, which passed as a sub
stitute for the Senate bill as a whole, al
though a number of amendments were
made. In the main the form of Govern
ment as finally determined upon is that
provided by the House. The chief amend
ments are those providing a district court
instead of the Federal court organized
under general laws, and the striking out
of the House provision postponing for one
year the time for applying the coasting
laws to Hawaii. The prohibition of sa
loons in Hawaii as provided by the House
bill is retained in a modified form, in ef
fect leaving the matter to local option.
\ne House provisions as to the land laws
are retained, including the amendment of
Representative Newlands of Nevada, re
stricting the amount of land to be held by
a corporation to 1000 acres. The other
Newlands amendment, providing for a
committee to investigate the labor ques
tion in Hawaii, is changed so that Com
missioner of Labor Wright will conduct
the inquiry. The appointment of Circuit
Judges, which was the subject of rather
earnest differences, -was finally decided by
leaving the appointments with the Presi
dent.
The bill establishes a complete form of
government for the Islands, with a Gov
ernor and other executive officers, a
Legislature of two branches and a Judl-
NEGOTIATIONS
FOR THE CANAL
RIGHT OF WAY
Central American Republics
Will Interpose No
Obstacles.
Isthmian Commission Said to Favor
the Panama Koute, but There
Are Objections to Its Ac
quisition.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL, HEADQUARTERS. WELLING
TON* HOTEL. WASHINGTON, April 17.â
It is likely that the administration will
use the time between now and the next
session of Congress in negotiations which
will enable this Government to secure Im
mediate control of the territory or such
rights in Central America as may be re
quired in the construction of the pro
posed canal. There has been talk that
the Walkor Isthmian Commission would
be called upon to make a preliminary re
port, but an official acquainted with the
work of the commission said that thia
was Impossible. The Darieii survey has
proceeded sufficiently to demonstrate that
there is no practical route for a canal
there, and the problem which the commis
sion will have to determine will be
whether the Panama or the Nicaragua
route presents the greater advantages.
It is understood that the commission Is
very favorably impressed with the Pana
ma route and the, work which has been
and is being done In the construction of
that enterprise. It' is stated that the pro
ject Is entirely feasible and that the canal
could be completed for less than the sum
which would be necessary to build the
Nicaragua canal. *
There are objections, however, to the
acquisition of the Panama canal, though
the company would be willing to sell its
rights to the United States and the Co
lombian Government would approve of
the transfer to this Government. These
objections He primarily in the fact that
stockholders in this canal are people of
France, who would undoubtedly desire
that their rights be respected by any
foreign purchaser.
It is evident from what can be learned
that Rear Admiral Walker has reported
to the officials sufficient information to
convince them that Colombia a3 well as
Costa Rica and Nicaragua would enter
into negotiations with the United States
with respect to the canal. Costa Rica
only a few days ago. through Senor
Calvo, its Minister here, informed the
administration of its willingness to do
everything in its power to further the
construction of the canal by the United
States. While it cannot withdraw sover
eignty from the territory which this Gov
ernment desires, there is a way by which
control of the necessary land can be se
cured.
T a meeting- of the board of direct-
II \\ ors of the Pacific Improvement
held in the offices of C. P.
Eiuntington yesterday. Richard Der
by was appointed secretary of the com
pany, to fill the vacancy caused by the
death last week of Frank S. Douty. Mr.
Derby went at once to the offices of the
company and commenced to familiarize
himself with his new duties.
The selection of Mr. Derby to so im
portant a position was a bis surprise to
everybody about the railroad building:, as
he had never been cons-idered even as a
possibility by those familiar with the
business of the big corporation. Mr. Derby
has been a clerk in the auditing depart
ment of the Southern Pacific Company,
and was chief clerk in the controller's de
partment, of which Secretary Wright is
the head. Mr. Derby is one of the most
popular men in the employ of the railroad
company. When the news of his appoint
ment spread through the building- it was
received with general expressions of good
will, and many officials hastened to con
gratulate him Thp only reason for Air.
Derby's selection seems to have been his
general fitness to manage the immense in^
terests to be entrusted to his care.

OUR COMMERCIAL RELATIONS.
ADVANCE sheets of "The Review of the
World's Commerce," which is soon to be is
sued from the State Department by way of in
troduction to the tÂ»\Q volumes of annual reports of
diplomatic and consular officers upon our commer
cial relations, make a very gratifying showing of our
foreign commerce during the past year, and of the
prospects of the future.
During the calendar year 1899 the domestic ex
ports of the United States amounted to $1,252,903,987,
against 5i. 233,558,140 in 189 S. The percentage of
manufactured products was 30.39 in 1899, 24.96 in
1S98; of agricultural products, 62.42 in 1899, 69.06 in
1S98; of mineral products, 2.66 in 1899, 2.09 in 1898; of
forest products, 3.8 in 1899, 3.16 in 1898; of fishery
products, 0.45 in 1899, 0.47 in 189 S.
Our total imports during the year were valued at
$798,845,571, against $634,964,448 in 1898, an increase
of nearly $164,000,000. There was a drop in the per
centage of "articles manufactured ready for consump
tion" from 16.5 in 1898 to 14.9 in 1899, although there
was an increase from 12.76 to 13.45 in "articles of vol
untary use, luxuries, etc." In other words, it would
appear that we are importing more foreign materials
for use in' our industries and less of finished manufac
tures, with a slight gain in our consumption of for
eign "luxuries."
A significant feature of the trade of the year is that
our exports increased during a period of great indus
trial activity in Europe and when competition was
correspondingly keen. It is thus evident we can hold
our own in the world's markets despite all that rivals
can do. In commenting upon the reports of Consuls
as to the demand for our goods, the Review says that
"neither the products of our agriculture, our forests
and our mines, .nor those of our workshops and fac
tories, have anything to fear so long as they preserve
their distinguishing merits, and the only danger
they have to face is a falling off in the standard either

THE Rocky Mountain News has spells of feeling
rocky, in which it brings forth its large type and
exclaims in double leads for Bryan and free

In its last fit of this kind it nominated and electd!

j population of Colorado, increased the price of real
estate by 100 per cent and raised silver to 90 cents an
ounce, the day after election. In exact terms the
News said: "The power of Bryan over Congress
would equal his influence with the American people.
It would be irresistible. If Bryan becomes President
I free coinage will be restored to silver before his term
expires.
"The mere fact of Bryan's election wouKi
i raise silver to 90 cents an ounce. How can loyal
! Coloradoans falter now? In the face of the fact that
the Democratic party in more than forty States is
pronounced for Bryan and free coinage, that the
Populists and Silver Republican parties are unani
mous for them, the Coloradoan that is not for Bryan
I is a traitor to his State, placing party before prosper
1 ity, and voting to completely destroy its silver mines,
for with the cause of silver made absolutely hopeless
the price of silver will decline yet one-half."
If merely electing Bryan will spur silver up to 90
cents an ounce, his inauguration should send it kiting
to $1.2929, or par with gold. As Mr. Bryan has con
tinually cried that dear money, par with gold, makes
low prices, we are compelled to say that the two
prophets, the News and Bryan, are working their gift
of vaticination against each other. They are- two
prophets, prophesying in the same vast, field, but
their prophecies don't pull together.
The News says that seductive efforts have been
made to woo Mr. Bryan from the path of duty to the
j divinely appointed ratio of 16 to 1, but that he has
j nobly refused, and his attitude has compelled William
R. Hearst to print a signed editorial pledging him
self to support Bryan. Of course when Hearst signs
an editorial things are getting serious. But will the
News explain why, if Mr. Bryan's devotion to -silver
will raise its price if he is elected, the devotion of
somebody to putty will not raise the price of that
useful commodity if the devotee is elected to the
Presidency?
If the price of commodities depends upon such
causes, let us have hog and hominy, bull butter, and

J., City. "All roads lead to Rome" is an
Italian proverb meaning that there are
many ways of accomplishing an end. It
was, however, in ancient times not so
much a proverbial as a literal truth. As
the city of Rome gradually extended Its

SHARKEY AND JEFFRIESâ J. P. P.,

Jeffries returned the blow, landing: hi.* left
squarely on the chin, and Tom (Sharkey>
went down in a neutral corner, where he
stayed for six seconds. Sharkey rushed
again but Jim (Jeffries) side-stepped and
Sharkey slipped to the floor on his hands.
The men were sparring when the gonsr
sounded." That is the only .round in
which Sharkey went down and stayed
down for any perceptible length of time.
FRAUDULENT MARRIAGEâ M. E. A..
Sissons. Cal. This correspondent writes:
"John Jones was divorced in California.
He could not marry again in that State
under a year. He left California to marry
Mary Smith, who was free to marry, anu
went to Oregon, where marriage is pro
hibited under a six months' residence.
To evade the law Jones sends some one
to represent him to obtain a marriage li
cense, all data as' to age, residence and
names being correct, w.th the exception
that the party who obtained the license
was not what he represented himself to
be. namely Jones. With that license
Jones married Mary Smith. Was that
marriage legal?"
The facts as stated show a clear fraud
in obtaining a license for one who under
the law could not marry in the State of
Oregon at the time the license was se
cured. Marriage is a contract and If
there is fraud in a contract it is held thai
the contract is void.

TO AVOID CONTENTIONS.
WHILE the success of the Republicans in this
campaign scenis well assured throughout the
there are nevertheless abundant .reasons
why every effort should be made to preserve harmony
iv the ranks so that the full party vote will be given
to every candidate. It will certainly be an act m
folly for those having authority to adopt a course
which will give rise to contentions or even to an ex
cuse for them. 11l feeling engendered by any act of
party leaders is apt to rankle and spread, and prove a
serious weakness to the organization as a whole.
At the present time there exist differences of
opinion concerning the expediency of holding pri- j
:nary elections in some Congressional districts for j
the purpose of electing delegates to a convention to
choose district delegates to the Republican National
Convention. Where such differences exist the dis
trict committees should call primaries. Any other
course will not only augment the discord in the party,
but will give ground on which contentions can be
bai-ed and sustained before the national convention.
The issue is a plain one. The call of the National
Committee for the national convention says: "Th-
Congressional district delegates shall be elected by
conventions called by the Congressional Committee
of each district, in the manner of nominating candi
dates for Representative in Congress in said district."
Under the law of California it is provided: "All dele
gates to conventions of political parties for the pur
pose of making nominations for candidates for public
ofi";ce within this State shall be elected at elections to
be known and designated as primary elections and
conducted at the time and place and under the regu
lations in this chapter hereinafter specified, and not
otherwise.
There can be no doubt as to the intent of the pri
mary law, nor of the call of the National Committees
Hence primary elections are necessary in every dis
trict where there is the least objection to any other
course of action. In some districts it is already cer
tain an attempt to avoid primaries will lead to a fac
tion f:?ht in the party ranks and the election of a
contesting delegation to the national convention.
In the Fifth District, for example, a strong body of
Republicans "have given notice that they will not be
found by a convention composed of delegates not
elected at primaries, and that if such a convention be
appointed they will call a convention of their own
and hold primaries as the law requires. That will
mean n division of the party in that district at the very
outset of the campaign, the appearance of representa
tives of the contending factions before the National
Coir.rrittee, and a controversy which will engender
bad I^Dod.on both sides.
There are other districts where the situation is as
critic? i as in the Fifth. It is known that in Ala-.ned.i
County a considerable number of Republicans will
onieci to a convention made up of appointed instead
of elected delegate?, and a similar condition of affairs
prevr-Is elsewhere. It is not worth while, however,
to pro over the whole State for examples. The safe
rule is that which we have stated â wherever there is
any difference of sentiment on the subject it is the
duty of the party authorities to provide for primaries.
The members of the party who demand primaries
have on their side the call of the National Committee
ard the law of the State. An attempt, therefore, to
ijrnore their demand would be a blunder of the worst
kind, and might seriously compromise the campaign
ir. more ways than one.

Young District Messenger Conveying From Philadelphia an Album Containing Newspaper Clippings
Favoring the Cause of the Boers and a Sympathetic Message Signed by 28,000 Schoolboys.
JAMES FRANCIS SMITH. THE COURIER; MAP SHOWING HIS ROUTE; FAC SIMILE OF PORTION OF PAGE
IN THE ALBUM, AND THE NORTH AMERICAN'S ADDRESS TO "OOM" PAUL. .
A PASSENGER on the swift ocean liner St. Louis, plowing
her way across the Atlantic, is James Francis Smith, a 16
year-old American District messenger, who is carrying
to President Kruger at Pretoria a message of sympathy
signed by 25.000 school boys of Philadelphia. Accompanying
this message is an album nearly two feet square, containing 500
leaves, on which are pasted clippings from prominent papers
in the United States. Among these clippings is one from The
Call of March 14, containing Father Yorke's stirring plea for
the brave burghers.
The album is being sent to President Kruger by the North
American in order vhat the people of South Africa may learn
what the press of America has to say about them.
Although W. W. Rayons, the general superintendent of the
American District Telegraph Company in New York, declares
that any messenger in the service would carry a message to
President Kruger. as a matter of course, and would start
without a moment's hesitation, young Smith is the happy se
lection from nearly 2000 boys. When Mr. Rayons was asked to
"ring up a boy" he sent orders to the district managers to
have the pick of their boys report at his office. About forty
boys responded, and these were quickly weeded out until three
remained. They were kept under observation for a couple of
days and finally the selection fell on young Smith. He was de-
tailed to special duty under Mr. Rayons and had no idea of.
the important mission intended for h!m.
He remained under scrutiny for several days and was then
suddenly asked. "Will you carry a message to President
Kruger?"
"Yes. sir," came the instant reply.*
"Do you know -where to find him?"
"Yes. sir; in South Africa."
"Supposing you find that President Kramer has been taken
to St. Helena when you reach South Africa, what will you do'/"
"Follow him to St. Helena, or to the end of the earth if
necessary.". ;.-!
"Do you know where St. Helena is?"
"Yes* sir; it is the island where Napoleon was Imprisoned
The boy. although earnest and alert, showed no more sur
prise or emotion when told that he was to go on an errand of
nearly 12,000 miles than if he had been sent around the corner
with a local telegram.
When asked what he would do if the British soldiers at
tempted to stop him on his way to Pretoria, he replied. "I would
appeal to an American Consul for protection."
The boy. who is known on the messenger force as No. V 'i.
will reach Havre on the ISth inst. and will then follow the
route indicated on the above map to Pretoria.
A WESTERN MAN WANTED.
REPUBLICAN leaders in the East are reported
to be well nigh unanimous in desiring the
nomination of a Western candidate for the
Vice Presidency on the Republican ticket. The occa
sion is therefore. propitious for the advancement of
such a candidate. It appears certain that if the Great
West will put forward a strong man, and give him
cordial support, the nomination for that high office
can be obtained for him.
The opportunity thus afforded for California to
place one of her citizens in the Vice Presidency
should not be overlooked. This is the Empire State
of the West. Its prestige on the Pacific Coast is
higher than that of New York on the Atlantic, but
that prestige has never been exerted in politics, and
accordingly the State has never had anything like its
rightful power and place in governmental affairs. The
call for a Western man coming at this time is there
fore one to which the Republicans of California
should give heed. The nomination is equivalent to
an election, and by the display of harmony and
energy at this juncture we may mark the beginning
of the new century by installing in the second highest
office of the republic a representative of the Pacific
There are many reasons why a Western man should
be preferred to one from the East at this time. In
the first place the choice of a candidate would
strengthen the ticket to some extent in this section
of the Union, and in the second place it would be a
due recognition of the growing greatness of the West
as compared with that section of the Union lying cast
of the Mississippi. The time has gone by when Eastern
wits could with any show of reason refer to the com
monwealths of the West as "mining camps." The
mining industry remains, but to it has been added
every other form of industry, and population and
wealth have increased to such an extent that these
States have now a right to claim a full share of the
highest offices in the land.
California does not lack for citizens well fitted t:Â»
fill the Vice Presidential office. It would be invidious
to cite the names of some worthy of the office while
omitting others, but it would be easy to name several
whom the people of the State could support with a
just pride for the position. The Call has no par
ticular candidate of ifs own to urge upon the party.
It will cordially unite in supporting any man whom
the Republicans of the State will nominate. The issue
is before the party. There comes from the East what
appears to be an earnest call for a Western candi
date, and California should not lose the opportunity
to advance her political prestige by presenting a man
whose candidacy would be acceptable to Republicans
.throughout the Union.

through carelessness or the mistaken desire to ob
tain larger profits by lowering the quality. * * *
This conclusion is the more obvious when we con
sider that .the remarkable development of our exports
of manufactures has been due to their excellence
rather than to any marked improvements in our
methods of pushing sales abroad."
Since so much complaint is heard of our Consular
service, it is worth noting in this connection the Re
view proves that a great deal of valuable work is done
by the present officers. The published reports are of
great use to manufacturers and to merchants, and no
other country has so rapid a system of disseminating
information, or one that so satisfactorily meets the re
quirements of industry and commerce.

AMERICAN WORDS OF CHEER FOR PRESIDENT KRUGER
THE SAN FRAJSTCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, 'APRIL 18, 1900.
THE COOLIE SHADOW
THERE is no room for any honest or thoughtful
person to misunderstand the purpose of The
Call's attempt to prevent the illegal landing ut
Chinese by exposing the method of it. In our first
expose we made no charge against any official. We
simply reproduced the official records, leaving con
clusions to be drawn by the reader. It is known that
not many Chinese laborers here have families; that
is one objection to their presence among us. Surely,
then, it is enough to put officials on their caution that
3000 male coolies are admitted within the last three
years as native sons, who went back to China before
the first exclusion law in 1882, and have concluded to
return to their birthplace only when the last law and
treaty close to them all methods of entry, except the
native son route. It will be interesting to examine
the proofs made of their birthplace and see the small
percentage born outside of San Francisco, and the
large proportion, running into the hundreds, who
were born at the same number on some street in
Chinatown. All of this internal evidence that the
majority of their landings are by fraud and perjury
is accessible.
What The Call desires is that the last treaty with
China and the exclusion law passed in pursuance
thereof be honestly administered. We desire that all
Chinese excepted from exclusion shall have their
rights, without -being compelled to bribe any Ameri
can officer to get them. We admit that proof may be
shown of cases in which Chinese merchants, and
others in the excepted classes, have been compelled
to pay dishonest officers for a right that belonged to
them under the law. We admit, also, that it is the
rule that when men have to secure by bribery what
belongs to them, they will recoup themselves by get
ting by bribery what does not belong to them. This
has been the curse of this whole Chinese business.
It has run through, it all. from the payment to the
police of a monthly bribe for protection to vice in
Chinatown clear to the fraudulent landing of ex
cluded Chinese by evasion of the Federal law. Now
a cry is raised that our latest exposure, consisting
merely of the publication of the official records, will
injure San Francisco by prejudicing the Chinese mer
chant class, whose presence is absolutely requisite in
the enlargement of our trade with their country. We
deny that exposure of violations of the law will have
any such effect. The system we expose injures the
merchant class, not its exposure. We insist that mer
chants and their bona fide wives and families shall
have the entry rights and freedom of transit and com
munication required by them, as by all merchants, in
the prosecution of their business. We affirm, aiso,
that they would have and enjoy these rights unob
structed and be treated with the same consideration
and courtesy accorded to their class of other races if
the law and treaty were uprightly administered.
As long as craft, cunning and corruption are in ac
tion to defeat the law by landing the excluded classes
the excepted classes and the merchants will suffer.
We believe that the Chinese merchants understand
this. We believe that they resent the landing of boat
women as merchants" wives. We are sure that Mr. Ho
Vow, the Consul General, appreciates the force of
what we say. He is a gentleman of extraordinary in
telligence, with talent^ and training that would make
him a credit to any race, and he ought to know that it
is to the best interests of his people that American
officials administer the exclusion law strictly and
justly. That is what The Call is trying to secure.
The place to begin is with the American officials, if
the law is evaded it is by reason of their corruption or
carelessness, their lack of honesty or their lack of in
telligence. What we are doing is not to the injury of
San Fr2ncisco, but for its benefit. If we succeed in
making this port noted for the best and strictest en
forcement of the exclusion law, we have made San
Francisco the best city in the United States for the
Chinese merchants, upon whom our trade with that
country depends.
We must be credited with discrimination in the mat
ter. When Consul General Ho Vow asked for greater
Harness and justice to the Chinese merchants he was
attacked by the Examiner and charged with trying to
punch a hole in the exclusion law. That paper and
others like it make a sensational play of the Chinese
question, and dump merchants and all together. It
hns never done any good by that policy. When the
party it represents was administering the law corrup
tion and bribery were so rank that buzzards fled to
their carrion for fresh air.
We are not making a sensation, but are deter
mined to stop the corruption or the stupidity, or
bcth. now plainly evident in the administration of the
law.
Give the excepted Chinese all their rights, without
bribe or price, but teach the excluded classes that
r.either by corruption nor craft can they get rights
that are denied by the law, is the policy we have in
view.

Got Away.
Eleven Out of Twenty-Six Austrian
Contract Laborers Bound for !
Hawaii Made Good Their
Escape From Ship.
The Occidental and Oriental Steamship
Company's steamer Doric sailed for the
Orient via Honolulu yesterday with a very
large cargo and a crowd of cabin passen
gers. Among the latter were Chang Hai
Kwan of the Chinese embassy in Wash
ington, who is nolng home. Commanders
A. R. Condon nr.d George Cowle, U. S. N.,
were also pas3engers. The latter goes out
to take charge of the machine shops at
Cavlte, while the former will take com
mand of one of the warships. J. H. Clai
borne, secretary for Pope & Talbot, Is
making the trip for his health. He takes
with him some very fine samples of Cali
fornia woods and will exhibit them in
China and Japan.
There was a big rumpus just before the
Doric got away. Twenty-six contract la
borers were supposed to sail on the vessel,
but only fifteen of them materialized. The
men are Austrians and came to the United
States under' contract to work in the
Hawaiian canefields. When they reached
here they learned what they would have
to do In the islands, and all made a break
for liberty. Eleven of them are still at
largo, but when the Doric sailed the other
fifteen were 1 securely locked up in the
forepeak of the ship with a strong guard
over them. The Southern Pacific detec
tives are now on the trail of the escapes,
and if they are caught they will be sent
on to Honolulu on the next steamer.
Nippon Mara Arrives.
The Japanese mail steamer Nippon
Maru arrived from the Orient via Hono
lulu yesterday. There were no new cases
of plague reported on the islands, but,
nevertheless, Dr. Klnyoun ordered the
vessel into quarantine. Late in the after
noon the cabin passengers from Hong
kong and Yokohama were landed, but the
Honolulu passengers will be kept aboard
until the vessel is released. The cabin
passengers on the Nippon Maru were:

THE GOLDEN AGE OF ENGLISH LITERATURE
Copyright, 1900, by Seymour Eaton.
GOLDEIV /\GES OF" LITERATURE.
XVII. THE ELIZABETHAN AGE.
BY VIDA D. SCUDDER.
Golden is a good adjective to apply to
Elizabethan literature, for that literature
Is all aglow with light. The sunshine of
the great Elizabethan day is pure and
fresh and Joyous at the beginning, in the
poetry of Sidney and Spenser; it is glo
rious with radiant warmth in the magnifi
cent work of Shakespeare; it is increas
ingly sad, though lovely, and suffused
with tragic crimson at last, as it stoops to
evening in the Jacobean drama.
We must remember that the Elizabeth
an period lasted really only a very short
time. Centuries had dragged their slow
length along with only here and there a
voice lifted to break the stillness; then
FUddenly, in the last quarter of the six
teenth century, England burst forth in a
chorus of song. We call the literary pc-
ing a quarter of a century more. All the
forces, however, which created the litera
ture of the renaissance were well under
way before Shakespeare died; after him
they were in their decline, and no new
method or power manifested itself till the
dying renaissance, the dominant puritan
ism, and the promise of the stately classi
cal reaction, all met in the work of Mil
ton.
From 1573 to MM is less than half a cen
tury, but in s-pniflcanr-e and beauty it
means more than all the ages that had
gone before. And it witnessed a complete
and profoundly interesting literary devel
opment In three clearly marked phases.
The first phase lasted until the publica
tion of the first three books of the "Fae
rie Queen" in 1590. This is a .non-dra
matic period, though the drama is begin
ning. Sir Philip Sidney and Spenser are
its two characteristic men; the work of
Spenser in particular spans and sums it
all. The rest of the Elizabethan age 1 â¢
dominated by the drama, and with tho
drama it passes through two distinc*
moods, though we cannot put our finger
riod that followed the Elizabethan age,
but it dees not really coincide with the
reign of the great Queen. She had as
cended the throne tn 15ii7, and during the
first half of her reign a hush rested upon
the land. We cannot wonder at this when
we realize that men were yet breathless
as It were with the shock and terror of
the experiences inflicted on the nation in
the reign of Queen Mary. Men whose
fathers had perhaps burned at the stake
were in no mood to chant madrigals. But
in the silence of the first twenty years of
Elizabeth's reign the keen observer can
trace ample signs of promise. All things
Indeed made ready for a great imagina
tive expansion. The foundations of the
national power hud at last been laid firm.
The young nation was at peace within,
enjoying a new commercial prosperity;
abroad she was measuring herself in no
ble warfare against Spain, a heroic foe.
Excited by the still recent discovery of
new worlds and of the classic past, men
looked away from the heavens whereon
their gaze all through the middle ages
had been fixed, beheld with a thrill of
freedom the horizons of earth ever widen
ing receding, beckoning, and felt them
selves, with Puck, able to clap a girdle
round the earth. A new temper was aris
ing, a temper of unbounded enthusiasm
for human art, beauty and learning, for
human passion and for human life. Tread
softly, for we are entering the days of
Shakespeare, the days of Spenser also and
of Sir Philip Sidney, of Bacon and Hooker
and Raleigh and Ben Jnnson. the days of
the sweetest lyrics England has ever
heard, of a noble reflective prose, of a su
preme drama.
It was in the year 1579 that three nota
ble books were publishedâ "Euphues," a
quaint romance which attempted the un
accustomed feat of describing with what
tried to be realism the experiences of a
young gentleman ot the day; North's
translation of "Plutarch's Lives." a book
on which Shakespeare was nourished, and
Spenser's lovely series of pastoral ec
logues, the "Shepherd's Calendar." The
Elizabethan period of literature had be-
To mark its close Is lees easy. We may
take the death of the Queen. In 1603, the
year after that in which "Hamlet" was
acted. Or. and this is more sensible, we
may take the death of Shakespeare, in
1616 Or we may go on still further, for
great things continued to be written dur-
on the exact elate when one mood changed
Into the other.
Let us look at the first phase. When
first the mysterious Impulse toward ar
tistic expression befcan to stir, men did
not take It very seriously. They toyed
with l!f> and art, poetry and prose. They
were â¢"empasslonrd" to u?e a fine word
of Spenser's, with felicity of phrase.
They tried countless literary experiments.
What, for instance, was the right way of
writing Enpllah verse? Should they copy
the quantitative, unrhymetl measures of
the ancients? Yes. answered for a tlmo
some of the best critics. Absurd though
this answer appear to us, we cannot won
der that it was Riven then. For the diff
nity and beauty of classic meters fell
fresh on people's ears, and of English
models they had few or none. So they set
to work solemnly to concoct hexameters,
sajjphics, what you will â an extraordinary
work they made of it. But the lovely,
new-born verse of English song laughed
at their pedantry, and her laughter rip
pled through their veins like music, and
in spite of themselves they began to sing
âthese would-be learned poets. Soon they
became intoxicated with the beauty of
their own words. They did not approve of
rhyme, but rhyme they did. with delicate
ease and abundance. They wanted to
write solemn quantitative verse, and mel
odies infinite in variety and charm rose
unbidden to their lips. No lyrical devel
opment has ever been seen like that of the
Elizabethan age.
What caused the whole nation to break
forth at once into sinking? Who can tell?
The more we study the more amazed we
grow at the singing quality that was in
the Elizabethan air. inspiring not only
great poets like Sidney and Spenser, but
al?o hosts of minor singers, unnamed and
unknown. The numerous anthologies pub
lished durlnnr this period attest the
strength of the lyrical Impulse. Their very
names are redolent of fantasy and sweet
ness. "The Paradise of Dainty Devices."
"A Gorgeous Gallery of Gallant Inven
tions." "The Phoenix's Nest." "The Pas
sionate Pilgrim." "England's Helicon."
"Davison's Poetical Rhapsody" arjj some
of them. Several of these have been re
printed In attractive modern editions. To
turn their pages is to wander through a
fragrant garden, breathing spice and
sweetness on every side.
Note â This study will be concluded to
morrow.

TO TEACH CITY
GOVERNMENT IN
PUBLIC SCHOOLS
Board of Education Has the
Proposition Now Under
Consideration.
Directors Mark and Kincaid Approve
the Practical Study and Will In
troduce It on a Small
Scale Next Term.
Â»
The Board of Education, is now consid
ering a plan to introduce the practical
study of municipal government in the
public schools ot this city. The plan con
templates the operation of a "school city,"
with ail the accompanying official depart
ments and presiding heads, and has been
successfully conducted in one of the
Fchools across the bay.
The fact that articles have been pub
lished recently In which the successful
operation of the plan in several of the
Mississippi Kiver States has been de
rcrlbed lias Inspired the local School
Board with the iuca of giving the Bubject
"The proposition," said Mrs. Kincald,
"iÂ« in its Ineipleney at the present time,
but we h<-i>e to make all the necessary
arrangements; to add this very Important
Ftudy of city jTovernment to the course
in one or Iwo of the largest schools."
Supfrlnter-derit of Schools Webster is
not so sanguine about the result. He is
rather opposed to the plan, but as he has
not examined thoroughly Into it he says
that he might be disposed to modify his
opinion soirewhal after further investi
erntion. Mr. Webster says that the danger
lifs in the probable introduction of a bad
cvjtcm of politics in the proposition and
a consequent lack of discipline, which
resulted when it was introduced In one of
the Ecgtern schools.
BUT ONE NEW
PLAGUE CASE
AT HONOLULU
Girl Thirteen Years of Age
Succumbs to the
Disease. \
President Dole Arouses a Storm of
Protest by Naming an Unpop
ular Fire Claims
Board.
' *
HONOLULU. April 10.â But one case of
plague has been reported since last ad
vices. The case was that of a half-caste
girl, aged 13 years, ending fatally. Two
suspicious cases of sickness were reported
on the 6th at Koolau, a small village on
this Island. The attending doctor reported
the cases as being plague. Two physicians
from this city were sent out, and, after
making an examination, declared that
there were no Indications of plague.
Hilo and Knhului are both clean again.
The Hilo people have declared their port
a clean one and request that no shipments
be made from Honolulu.
For the first time since the outbreak of
the plague the steamer Australia will be
allowed to carry steorage passengers from
this port for San Francisco. The vessel
will leave here on the 17th with her steer
age packed with men who have been wait-
Ing for months to get out of Honolulu.
By an executivo order bearing date of
the 2d inst. President Dole has created "a
court of commissioners to take evidence
of losses caused by the burning of China
town in Honolulu and to make awards
and judgments on such losses."
The court is created and commissioners
appointed by authority of President Me-
Ivinley. The members are: J. Alfred Ma
goon, George A. Davis, Lorin Andrews,
A. Noa Kepoikai and Alfred F. Judd Jr.
All are members of the bar. The an
nouncement of their appointment was not
received with satisfaction by the commu
nity; In fact it raised a wave of Indigna
tion. It is' considered proper that busi
ness men should be represented on the
board. The Chamber of Commerce has
1 protested against the court. The Japan
Â¦ ese and Chinese residents In mass-meet
ing have denounced it, and finally the
Council of State has refused to appro
priate the money necessary for the court
to carry on its work. The only way out
of the difficulty will be for President Dole
to request the resignations of the court
and then appoint new men who will be ac
ceptable to the business interests.
"I certainly will not ask the members of
the Court of Claims to resign," said Presi
dent Dole. But notwithstanding the Pres
ident's desire not to change the court, it
is believed that public opinion will compel
him to change his mind.
The twenty-fifth annual meeting of the
Woman's Baptist Forelgn_ Missionary So
ciety of California Is to "be" held at* the
First Baptist Church. Eddy street, to
morrow. The session will open at 10:30
a, m. and last till 4 p. m. Delegates are
expected to be present from all parts of

BUSY TIMES FOR THE
DOG SHOW OFFICIALS
Closing Pays in Which Entries May
Be Made Bring a Rush of Work
to Kennel Club Officers.
Probably the busiest place in the busy
city just now is the office of the San
Francisco Kennel Club. 238 Montgomery
street. With a larger clerical force than
ever before employed, and working from
8 a. m. until 10 p. m.. "Dave" Sinclair and
his assistants have all they can do to
cope with the rush of entries. Only six
days remain in which it Js possible to
enter a dog, and the owners of fine dogs
realize that it is imperative that they be
entered at once. No pedigree is necessary
to show a dog, for once before the Judge
the candidate for the blue ribbon is Judg
ed entirely on his own merits.
Among the notable cocker spaniels en
tered is a red puppy dog owned by Mrs.
B. Clark. Mrs. D. H. Hogan has entered
a field spaniel puppy dog that will make
his older competitors do their best to de
feat him. The bull terrier men are espe
cially energetic. John D. Spreckels has
entered his kennel and will try conclu
sions with all the cracks the other fan
ciers may import from \ England and thÂ«Â»
East.
Mrs. Timothy Hopkins will show her
mastiff, Lola Montez, by Chlno Don ex
Lola. This young mastiff has developed
wonderfully since last year, when she
easily won the first prize in the puppy
class. Mrs. James L. Flood will show a
magnificent brace of mastiffsâ Caesar * .
by Roderick Dhu ex Baby Ruth, and
Myra F. by Major II ex Queen Bess. Col
onel Flood will show his handsome collie
Maxwell.
Handsome prizes are offered by the club
for trick dogs Besides the regular money
prizes, trophies ranging in value from $25

besides a large and varied assortment or

GETTING CLOSE UPON
CHARGES OF FORGERY
Photographs, Checks and Letters Take
Place of Sensational Testimony
in the Fair Case.
CONTRACT SIGNATURE BETWEEN TWO OTHERS TAKEN FROM CHECKS.
WITNESSES who saw and heard
have made their exit in the Fair
case for the time being and In
their place has come the expert
with his lines and dots and angles. The
curtain has fallen on the first act of the
respondent's play and the three charac
ters. Sylva, Dunand and Slmpton, have
come and gone. They were called to
prove that Senator Fair and Mrs. Craven
v.-ere not married with the full solemnity
of the law.
The second act will be all for the expert,
and his work will tend toward the proof
that the signature of the marriage con
tract is a forgery. And the pencil deeds
will be again introduced by the defense in
an attempt to show that Mrs. Craven's I
statement on cross-examination that the ]
Senator provided for her by a gift of the I
Mission and Sansome street properties
v;as false. It rr>ay come to pass, if the
opposing attorneys reach a unanimity,
that the evidence taken In the pencil-deed
case may be read into the record of the,
present case. Should this agreement be
consummated much time and expense will
be paved both parties.
When the session opened yesterday
morning Theodore Kytka. expert in chi- j
rographv and photographer of documents. â¢
was on "hand with a large box "as black
as starless night." This is Kytka's own j
and looks like the trunk mystery appar- i
atua of e-ome Mack magician. The Pences
and their client expected to see the ghost '
of Senator Fair drawn from {he recesses
of the cavernous sable box, but all that
was taken from its depths was a photo
graph or two, a negative and some speci
mens of handwriting.
Before Kytka mounted the witness
stand and told the court what ho knew
about documentary photography and what
an expert he was. Charles E. Stewart, the
accountant of the Fair estate, identified
the signature of James G. Fair on a batch
of checks. Attorney Crothers passed
check after check, signed by Senator Fair,
into the evidence. There were twenty-one
of them In the first bundle, all of them
made between the 20th and 2Rthof May,
1592, the time at which the alleged mar
riage contract is claimed to have been
executed and signed. Another bundle of
checks, made and signed In September,
1594. the time of the pencil deeds, was in
troduced and â¢ admitted, besides letters
written at the some time.
The Pence attorneys made no objection
to the admission of those checks and let
ters and the cross-examination of Stewart
was brief. Lafe Pence asked for other
checks slpned by Senator Fair and was
satisfied with the promise of attorneys to
produce them at the rail.
On a r*f|UO3t from T>afe Pence to post
pone the trial until to-day at 2 p. m. the
court adjourned the case. Mrs. Craven's
attorneys were desirous of examining a
laryre photograph of the admitted signa
tures of Fair studded around the contract
sfpnaturp. Professor Ames will be the
expert on handwriting called by the Fair
attorneys.

CHICAGO, April 17.â Wheat began the day
dull and easy. There was no encouragement
In cables. The rains continued to be regarded
as favorable to the crop and cash people re
ported nothing doing. The long stuff soon be
gan to ccme out more liberally, part of It be
cause it had to be sold, some in sympathy
with the slump In corn. The pit was gloomy
and well nigh deserted. Liquidation was not
in large lots, but the small lots came in plen
tifully, meeting Bmall demand. The excellent
report of the condition of the crop In Kansas
was probably a consideration with some, for
while there were differences of opinion as to
the size of the crop reaspning from the official
figures as to percentage and acreage it was
generally admitted that it would be liberal.
Bradstreet's figures showing a decrease In the
world's visible of 2,373,000 bushels caused a
momentary check in the decline â but only a
momentary one. May opened a shade lower at
wiVuCti-V, and sold down to 66VÂ»c, closing at
that figure, %c under yesterday. July opened
a shade down at 68c to 67% c, sold down to
67%i(C7^c and closed He depressed at 67Vic.
The corn market was dull and weak. The
demand was In every way slack and liquida
tion caused a decline. May closed weak, lc
under yesterday. July closed lc down.
The oats market closed weak. There was
a continuance of May liquidation in oats which
has been under way for Beveral days. May
closed %c lower.
There was a big provision trade, the feature
of which was pork. Hogs were higher and re
ceipts only 14,000 head. . There was a good
general demand and shorts saw fit to cover.
Lard and ribs relinquished some of their early
gains, but closed steady, while pork, although
there was a dip from the early bulge, re
covered and closed strong. May pork closed
22V4C over yesterday, July 17Vjc up; May lard
2Vic improved. July 2Vic better and May ribs
closed unchanged, July 2%c lower.

NKW YORK. April 17.â The published opin
ions an-l assertions cf J. W. Gates, chairman
cf the American Steel and Wire <Ximpany, re
garding the present conditions and the put
look for the future in the iron and steel trade
o. eujiled the attention of dealers In stocks and
bonds to the almost total excluelon of all
other rnatttrs to-day. Demoralization and ron
futijon were the results. A striking commen
tary uiKin the way forces work in the stock
market Ik that the Iron and steel stocks are the
only oneÂ« that chow striking net rains while
the net lo#stB Bvcnrwfaen else are due to the
fears of unsound conditions of the iron tmde

trade. When the urpeot demand for thÂ» Iron
and steel stocks was perceived Immediately
after the opening drop In them, there was a
feeling of relief reflected In a lively recovery

of the buying of these stocks Â«v that It
contradicted the gloomy assertion* of the chair
man of the Steel and Wire Company. The
convictlf n seems to gather force that thli
buying niight simply represent the taking 0
profit by titans who had sold in antlcipatioi
erf the recent heavy declines ta these stocks
The assertions of the chairman of over-pro
duotlon in the trade and the necessity foi
conoertlor.s in prices were met by a chorui
of disclaimers by representatives of other com
I&r.les in the metal Industries and by author
ities in the trade. These disclaimers were ac
companied by much bitter Invective and ques
tloning of motive. The reassurance derlvec
from this uource had muoh to do with thi
genera! rally after the opening, but It wu no'
sufficient to allay all doubts caused by th<
concrete fact of the closing down of a largÂ«
number of the milli! of the Steel and Win
Company. One of the authorities who sough'

disturbances there. The latest cabled freight
quotations on coal from Australia show a soft

ed. There are reported engaged to carry coal
from Newcastle and Sydney thirty-six Vessels
with a carrying capacity of 114. < X* tons; tha
major portion of this will not be delivered here
for several months. We will have an im
mense surplus of grain to move this year,
which necessitates our being forced to pay
generous freight rates to carriers. Sailing ves
sels must head thi3 way, and much the larger
porportion of those coming will carry us coai,
so that we may naturally look for free deliv
eries the latter part of this year. Coal fret*'..ts
from Newcastle should decline, as the present
asking rates are driving colonial fuel out of
the market; local buyers can do better by con
fining their contracts entirely to our coast

CHICAGO, April 17.â Wheat began the day
dull and easy. There was no encouragement
In cables. The rains continued to be regarded
as favorable to the crop and cash people re
ported nothing doing. The long stuff soon be
gan to ccme out more liberally, part of It be
cause it had to be sold, some in sympathy
with the slump In corn. The pit was gloomy
and well nigh deserted. Liquidation was not
in large lots, but the small lots came in plen
tifully, meeting Bmall demand. The excellent
report of the condition of the crop In Kansas
was probably a consideration with some, for
while there were differences of opinion as to
the size of the crop reaspning from the official
figures as to percentage and acreage it was
generally admitted that it would be liberal.
Bradstreet's figures showing a decrease In the
world's visible of 2,373,000 bushels caused a
momentary check in the decline â but only a
momentary one. May opened a shade lower at
wiVuCti-V, and sold down to 66VÂ»c, closing at
that figure, %c under yesterday. July opened
a shade down at 68c to 67% c, sold down to
67%i(C7^c and closed He depressed at 67Vic.
The corn market was dull and weak. The
demand was In every way slack and liquida
tion caused a decline. May closed weak, lc
under yesterday. July closed lc down.
The oats market closed weak. There was
a continuance of May liquidation in oats which
has been under way for Beveral days. May
closed %c lower.
There was a big provision trade, the feature
of which was pork. Hogs were higher and re
ceipts only 14,000 head. . There was a good
general demand and shorts saw fit to cover.
Lard and ribs relinquished some of their early
gains, but closed steady, while pork, although
there was a dip from the early bulge, re
covered and closed strong. May pork closed
22V4C over yesterday, July 17Vjc up; May lard
2Vic improved. July 2Vic better and May ribs
closed unchanged, July 2%c lower.
The leading futures ranged as follows:

NKW YORK. April 17.â The published opin
ions an-l assertions cf J. W. Gates, chairman
cf the American Steel and Wire <Ximpany, re
garding the present conditions and the put
look for the future in the iron and steel trade
o. eujiled the attention of dealers In stocks and
bonds to the almost total excluelon of all
other rnatttrs to-day. Demoralization and ron
futijon were the results. A striking commen
tary uiKin the way forces work in the stock
market Ik that the Iron and steel stocks are the
only oneÂ« that chow striking net rains while
the net lo#stB Bvcnrwfaen else are due to the
fears of unsound conditions of the iron tmde
Â«.nd In the securities cf oorporatlons In that
trade. When the urpeot demand for thÂ» Iron
and steel stocks was perceived Immediately
after the opening drop In them, there was a
feeling of relief reflected In a lively recovery
vi prices all around. The first interpretation
of the buying of these stocks Â«v that It
contradicted the gloomy assertion* of the chair
man of the Steel and Wire Company. The
convictlf n seems to gather force that thli
buying niight simply represent the taking 0
profit by titans who had sold in antlcipatioi
erf the recent heavy declines ta these stocks
The assertions of the chairman of over-pro
duotlon in the trade and the necessity foi
conoertlor.s in prices were met by a chorui
of disclaimers by representatives of other com
I&r.les in the metal Industries and by author
ities in the trade. These disclaimers were ac
companied by much bitter Invective and ques
tloning of motive. The reassurance derlvec
from this uource had muoh to do with thi
genera! rally after the opening, but It wu no'
sufficient to allay all doubts caused by th<
concrete fact of the closing down of a largÂ«
number of the milli! of the Steel and Win
Company. One of the authorities who sough'
to controvert the j>osltlon of Chairman Gate!
trjrueti that If the Iron and steel Industry Is
in a* bad condition as Mr. Gates painted thei
practically all securities are Â£0 per cent to<
high. Tt.'.s authority tr.es.nt to enforce hii
view that the high level of security prleei
and the general prosperity of the countri
themselves sÂ»rve to controvert the view tha'
the Iron trade Is unsound, but the belief li
deep-rooted among; stock operators that thÂ«
iron trade !s a true index of the business o;
the country- The doubt cast upon its sound
n^rm \;7 so prominent an authority proved toe
much for the equanimity of. holders of stock'
and toward the latter part of the day thrs (
fwurities were thrown upon the market lÂ»j
the wholesale.. Stocks which have been *pecu
latlve favorites for a rise were not the rhle
(sufferers. Missouri Pacific. Norfolk and West
ern and the Baltimore and Ohi>Â» stocks werÂ»
comparatively well held, while the higher
!>ri<-e<i stocks which are selling high In pro
jortion to the dividend return showed larger
declines. A late rally Jn the market made
It evident to how large an extent short selling
bad to do with the loss and recoveries, reach-
ing over a point in many cases, while the
iron and steel stocks closed 1 to 2 points above
last night's level for the leading members of
tiie group. The general news of the day and
money market conditions were entirely Ignored
in the trading.
There was no euch pressure manifest In the
bond market as In the stock market and strong
points were manifest here and there. Total
ealee, par value, $2,400,000.

from Newcastle and Sydney thirty-six Vessels
with a carrying capacity of 114. < X* tons; tha
major portion of this will not be delivered here

which necessitates our being forced to pay
generous freight rates to carriers. Sailing ves

so that we may naturally look for free deliv

5.4COFFEE ARGUMENT.
New Evidence of the Effect.
A South Dakota man, W. A. Dawley,
Sturgis, explains the condition si me
men get into from coffee drinking. Let
it be understood that coffee seems to
agree with some people well enough,
but \\ la p a person finds it does not
agree it is better to leave it off. He
says: '"I used coffee about twenty
years, and quit it September 30, 1898.
1 had become almost a complete wreck,
thin in rich and emaciated, dyspepsia
and indigestion of the worst orden
nerves shattered, no appetite, slept very
little, and my blood was so thin that the
slightest breeze chilled me through.
'"Medicines gave no relief. I had
about given up when I finally concluded
to investigate and see if it was really
true, as I had read in a number of your
statements, that coffee acted like a poi-
son to some people. It was an easy
matter to leave off coffee when I took
Postum Food Coffee, for the food cof-
fee taste! as good as the other, and, to
my' surprise, it set good on my weak
stomach.
"I have been buying the Postum
through my grocer." Mr. James Meyer,
and always have followed directions
carefully. I Irked it from the first and
have drank Postum three times a day
ever fince. Have pained twenty pounds
in weight, my appetite is better than
ever before, my sleep perfect, dyspepsia
is a thins; of the past, and my nerves are
what they should be. I can vouch for
the statement that Postum Food Coffee
'makes red blood' and plenty of it. My
son, Amos Dawley of this city, has been
completely cured of dyspepsia in three
months by quinine coffee and using
Postum Food Coffee This is given
you as an honest testimonial of the
priceless value of your (tS* me) life-
saving food drink. You are welcome to
use my name if you want" Respect-
fully. ' ':â¢'Â¦ <;/^jL

SHIRT ESTABLISHED
SUICIDE'S IDENTITY
Dead Man Discovered to Be Frank
Merwin by the Man Who Gave
Him Article of Apparel.
The mystery which surrounded the man
who was found dead in the lodging house
at 317 Third street last Thursday has
been cleared Up. He was yesterday posi
tively identified as Frank Merwln and the
police and Morgue officials are satisfied.
Detectives AVrenn and Dinan, who were
detailed on the case, succeeded in tracing
his identity by means of the shirt, upon
which deceased had written a facetious
note shortly before he ended his life. Hart
Bouton, superintendent of the La Grand
and White laundries, settled all doubts
yesterday by stating that he knew de
ceased well and had given him the shirt
marked "1001." which was on the body.
Â¦ According to his statement Merwin was
a cook and had signed to act in that ca
pacity on the bark Felton, which was to
sail for Seattle and Nome the day follow
ing his tragic death.
Morgue Surgeon Leland reported to Cor
oner Cole that he had been unable to find
any lesion of the organs that would ac
count for the death of the man. He said
he found some rigidity of the heart, as
though there might have been paralysis of
that organ, but he did not think that the
indications were sufficient to be taken as
the cause of death. City Chemist Charles
L. Morgan, who analyzed the stomach, re
ported that he had failed to find any
traces of poison. He was of the opinion
that if the suicide had taken phosphorus
and strychnine pills traces of the poison
would be found.

POPULISTS ARE READY
TO HOLD A CONVENTION
Committee Appointed to Formulate a
Callâ Session to Be Held in This
City on May 1.
There was a large and enthusiastic
meeting of Populists in the assembly
room of the Parrott building last even
ing. It was called at the request of Mr.
Osborne, a national commltteeman, who
was sent out by the leaders of the move
ment to secure delegates from this State
to the convention which will meet ln Cin
cinnati. Horace W. Phllbrook presided
and George A. Clough acted as secretary.
It was unanimously decided to call a
State convention for the Ist day of May,
and as there was a lack of time to hold
primaries or county conventions It was
agreed that the delegates who composed
the convention which met in Sacramento
in IS9S should be called into session again
in the Turk-street Temple on May 1.
A striking feature of last night s meet
ing was the presence of a large number ot
delegates who supported fusion and Ma
guire in IS9B and who are coming out for
united action this year.
A committee consisting of John A. Mil
ler, JameÂ« Taylor Rogers, H. A. Phll
brook. George W. Montelth. T. H. Porter,
Henry C. Greer, G. 11. Hubbell, J. K.
Phillips, C. D. Rodgera and John A.
Prosek was appointed to issue the address
and to formulate a call for the conven
tion.
Bun said the man had attempted suicide,
but -this was -vigorously denied by Lee
Won to the members of tha Lee family,
to which he belongs, after he was re
mdved from the place. HÂ« declared that
after he had been captured he was beaten
and then a knife was drawn across his
throat. The Lee family immediately
raised $200 to prosecute his assailant*, but
after some dickering with the friends of
the latter they agreed that if the man
should survive his injuries he would be
compensated liberally and only ln case
of death should the aid of American law
be Invoked.
The Chinese who wielded the weapon
claims that he did not intend Co kill Lee
Won, but simply desired to mark him for
life. He says his victim suddenly lunged
forward and the blade penetrated farther
than he had desired.
Several nights ago Jue Pon, another out
law from the faction, having ln charge
the shipment of Chinese to Alaska, was
captured and placed in a basement on
Washington street. He was later found
by the officers with hia throat cut. Owing
to the fact that he is a member of the
family that hires the men and who did
the cutting no retribution for his horrible
injuries has been asked.
A TERRIBLE Instance of Chinese
brutality and lawlessness was re
lated to the police in Chinatown
for Investigation last night. Ac
cording to the verified report made to the
officers, the Mongolians have been taking
the law Into their own hands and punish
ing offenders by brutal methods, extend
ing even to attempted murder. Two Ce
lestials who were paid advance money to
join the exodus of fishermen to Alaska
and who squandered the coin over the
fan tan table and then hid until after the
steamers had sailed were captured by
their countrymen and, it is claimed, con
fined in an improvised prison, brutally
beaten and their throats slashed with
razors.
Fifty other Chinese, who also failed to
keep their engagements to their employ
ers, have had rewards placed on their
heads, and circulars announcing this have
been posted in the principal thoroughfares
of the Chinese district. â¢
About three weeks ago Lee Won was
found in the rooms of Jue Bun, Chinese
agent for the Alaska Commercial Com
pany at 711 Commercial street, with a

home, 1611 Bush street. He was ill
less than half an hour. When he started

He was advised to hasten home and
take a rest. He arrived at his residence

years of age. He leaves a widow, four
grown daughters and two grown sons.
He was of a cheery disposition, popu
lar with all who knew him and was held

ALAMEDA, April 17.â Not until bride
and groom called upon her on Sunday last
to pay their respects did Mrs. Colonel J.
J. Tobin know that her brother. John F.
Ward, had become a benedict. Neither
did any of the many friends of Mr. Ward
flream that he had forsaken single bless
edness for matrimony. Mrs. Colonel
Tobin was taken quite aback herself by
the tardy announcement, and before her
recovery from the shock had confided the
interesting: information to a select few.
That is how the news got out.
To a bachelor's life Mr. Ward's friends
thought he was unalterably wedded.
Nearly 40 when he was a resident of Ala
meda they thought he had passed the
marrying age. No wonder, then, there
will be surprise when for the first time
public announcement is made that in June
last, in San Francisco, Mr. Ward married
Miss Eva Finn, daughter of an Eastern
capitalist who recently came to California
with his family to reside. Mrs. Ward is
handsome and accomplished.
Formerly Mr. Ward was enpraged ln the
real estate business In Alameda and later
was cashier of the now retired Encinal

CharieÂ« L. Stevens is a white-haired

JuriÃe ESllsworth'a court was the scene
of the trial of a suit to-day in which the
lady in auction claimed that Stevens
should be ordered to pay her two years'
â¢waees for acting as his housekeeper. In
her opinion S3O a month would be a rea
t-'nable oatnpecsmtioti for her services.
In the complaint there was no mention
of a proposed marriage, but Stevens so
testified and caused Miss Hade a deal of
embarrassment. He said the lady came
to his farm because she was too ill to do
regular work and that he gave her a home
Â¦until she was well. After a time, so
Stevens alleged, Cupid supported to Miss
Hade that it would be better all around if
they entered Into other relations than
those of employer and housekeeper, and
she proposed that they become riusband

SAMUEL ROSENER.COFFEE ARGUMENT.
New Evidence of the Effect.
A South Dakota man, W. A. Dawley,
Sturgis, explains the condition si me
men get into from coffee drinking. Let
it be understood that coffee seems to
agree with some people well enough,
but \\ la p a person finds it does not
agree it is better to leave it off. He
says: '"I used coffee about twenty
years, and quit it September 30, 1898.
1 had become almost a complete wreck,
thin in rich and emaciated, dyspepsia
and indigestion of the worst orden
nerves shattered, no appetite, slept very
little, and my blood was so thin that the
slightest breeze chilled me through.
'"Medicines gave no relief. I had
about given up when I finally concluded
to investigate and see if it was really
true, as I had read in a number of your
statements, that coffee acted like a poi-
son to some people. It was an easy
matter to leave off coffee when I took
Postum Food Coffee, for the food cof-
fee taste! as good as the other, and, to
my' surprise, it set good on my weak
stomach.
"I have been buying the Postum
through my grocer." Mr. James Meyer,
and always have followed directions
carefully. I Irked it from the first and
have drank Postum three times a day
ever fince. Have pained twenty pounds
in weight, my appetite is better than
ever before, my sleep perfect, dyspepsia
is a thins; of the past, and my nerves are
what they should be. I can vouch for
the statement that Postum Food Coffee
'makes red blood' and plenty of it. My
son, Amos Dawley of this city, has been
completely cured of dyspepsia in three
months by quinine coffee and using
Postum Food Coffee This is given
you as an honest testimonial of the
priceless value of your (tS* me) life-

SHIRT ESTABLISHED
SUICIDE'S IDENTITY
Dead Man Discovered to Be Frank
Merwin by the Man Who Gave
Him Article of Apparel.
The mystery which surrounded the man
who was found dead in the lodging house
at 317 Third street last Thursday has
been cleared Up. He was yesterday posi
tively identified as Frank Merwln and the
police and Morgue officials are satisfied.
Detectives AVrenn and Dinan, who were
detailed on the case, succeeded in tracing
his identity by means of the shirt, upon
which deceased had written a facetious
note shortly before he ended his life. Hart
Bouton, superintendent of the La Grand
and White laundries, settled all doubts
yesterday by stating that he knew de
ceased well and had given him the shirt
marked "1001." which was on the body.
Â¦ According to his statement Merwin was
a cook and had signed to act in that ca
pacity on the bark Felton, which was to
sail for Seattle and Nome the day follow
ing his tragic death.
Morgue Surgeon Leland reported to Cor
oner Cole that he had been unable to find
any lesion of the organs that would ac
count for the death of the man. He said
he found some rigidity of the heart, as
though there might have been paralysis of
that organ, but he did not think that the
indications were sufficient to be taken as
the cause of death. City Chemist Charles
L. Morgan, who analyzed the stomach, re
ported that he had failed to find any
traces of poison. He was of the opinion
that if the suicide had taken phosphorus
and strychnine pills traces of the poison
would be found.

thrown from the buggy and Mrs. Irish
was thrown head first into a pile of rocks,
being rendered unconscious. Mr. Irish
was badly cut and bruised about the
head and sustained a deep scalp wound,
but he did not itrike hard enough to ren
der him unconscious.

broken In two different places, one side of
her skull was laid bare from a wide gash
and she was completely paralyzed. She
never regained consciousness and died at

powder Inserted and exploded, which blew
the door open. Some of the tools used
were taken from a blacksmith shop ln

POPULISTS ARE READY
TO HOLD A CONVENTION
Committee Appointed to Formulate a
Callâ Session to Be Held in This
City on May 1.
There was a large and enthusiastic
meeting of Populists in the assembly
room of the Parrott building last even
ing. It was called at the request of Mr.
Osborne, a national commltteeman, who
was sent out by the leaders of the move
ment to secure delegates from this State
to the convention which will meet ln Cin
cinnati. Horace W. Phllbrook presided
and George A. Clough acted as secretary.
It was unanimously decided to call a
State convention for the Ist day of May,
and as there was a lack of time to hold
primaries or county conventions It was
agreed that the delegates who composed
the convention which met in Sacramento
in IS9S should be called into session again
in the Turk-street Temple on May 1.
A striking feature of last night s meet
ing was the presence of a large number ot
delegates who supported fusion and Ma
guire in IS9B and who are coming out for
united action this year.
A committee consisting of John A. Mil
ler, JameÂ« Taylor Rogers, H. A. Phll
brook. George W. Montelth. T. H. Porter,
Henry C. Greer, G. 11. Hubbell, J. K.
Phillips, C. D. Rodgera and John A.
Prosek was appointed to issue the address
and to formulate a call for the conven
tion.
Bun said the man had attempted suicide,
but -this was -vigorously denied by Lee
Won to the members of tha Lee family,
to which he belongs, after he was re
mdved from the place. HÂ« declared that
after he had been captured he was beaten
and then a knife was drawn across his
throat. The Lee family immediately
raised $200 to prosecute his assailant*, but
after some dickering with the friends of
the latter they agreed that if the man
should survive his injuries he would be
compensated liberally and only ln case
of death should the aid of American law
be Invoked.
The Chinese who wielded the weapon
claims that he did not intend Co kill Lee
Won, but simply desired to mark him for
life. He says his victim suddenly lunged
forward and the blade penetrated farther
than he had desired.
Several nights ago Jue Pon, another out
law from the faction, having ln charge
the shipment of Chinese to Alaska, was
captured and placed in a basement on
Washington street. He was later found
by the officers with hia throat cut. Owing
to the fact that he is a member of the
family that hires the men and who did
the cutting no retribution for his horrible
injuries has been asked.
A TERRIBLE Instance of Chinese
brutality and lawlessness was re
lated to the police in Chinatown
for Investigation last night. Ac
cording to the verified report made to the
officers, the Mongolians have been taking
the law Into their own hands and punish
ing offenders by brutal methods, extend
ing even to attempted murder. Two Ce
lestials who were paid advance money to
join the exodus of fishermen to Alaska
and who squandered the coin over the
fan tan table and then hid until after the
steamers had sailed were captured by
their countrymen and, it is claimed, con
fined in an improvised prison, brutally
beaten and their throats slashed with
razors.
Fifty other Chinese, who also failed to
keep their engagements to their employ
ers, have had rewards placed on their
heads, and circulars announcing this have
been posted in the principal thoroughfares
of the Chinese district. â¢
About three weeks ago Lee Won was
found in the rooms of Jue Bun, Chinese
agent for the Alaska Commercial Com
pany at 711 Commercial street, with a
large gash ln his throat. Friends of Jue
SEXTON ROSENER IS
SUMMONED BY DEATH
SAMUEL. ROSENER, for more than
ten years sexton of Temple Emanu-
El, dfed suddenly yesterday at his
home, 1611 Bush street. He was ill
less than half an hour. When he started
downtown early In the morning he was
apparently in perfect health. : He met
some friends about noontime and com
plained that he was suffering from a se
vere pain in his side, which had come on
rather suddenly and which was giving
him much uneasiness.
He was advised to hasten home and
take a rest. He arrived at his residence
a little after noon and a physician was
summoned. Before the doctors arrived
Rosenor applied a mustard plaster over
the region of his heart, where the pain
seemed most intense.
Complaining to his wife that the plaster
was too strong, he groaned and expired.
Deceased was a native of Germany, 61
years of age. He leaves a widow, four
grown daughters and two grown sons.
He was of a cheery disposition, popu
lar with all who knew him and was held
in high esteem by the congregation of
Temple Emanu-El.

John F. Ward Announces
His Marriage After
Ten Months.
Bride Is Miss Eva Finn, Daughter of
a Wealthy Easterner Who Re
cently Made California
His Home.
ALAMEDA, April 17.â Not until bride
and groom called upon her on Sunday last
to pay their respects did Mrs. Colonel J.
J. Tobin know that her brother. John F.
Ward, had become a benedict. Neither
did any of the many friends of Mr. Ward
flream that he had forsaken single bless
edness for matrimony. Mrs. Colonel
Tobin was taken quite aback herself by
the tardy announcement, and before her
recovery from the shock had confided the
interesting: information to a select few.
That is how the news got out.
To a bachelor's life Mr. Ward's friends
thought he was unalterably wedded.
Nearly 40 when he was a resident of Ala
meda they thought he had passed the
marrying age. No wonder, then, there
will be surprise when for the first time
public announcement is made that in June
last, in San Francisco, Mr. Ward married
Miss Eva Finn, daughter of an Eastern
capitalist who recently came to California
with his family to reside. Mrs. Ward is
handsome and accomplished.
Formerly Mr. Ward was enpraged ln the
real estate business In Alameda and later
was cashier of the now retired Encinal
Bank. At present he is identified with the
Hibernia Bank.

Â»
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
111S Broadway, April 17.
M'.ss Adeline Bade would a-wootng go.
whether Sievens Â¦wanted or no. and her
desire not to prÂ«i;rÂ«"=.s far beyond middle
JU;e in a Ftate of single blessedness led to
lfgal complications, rendering necessary'
the service of Judge Ellsworth as referee.
CharieÂ« L. Stevens is a white-haired
widower, er.jraEed In farming near Pleas
onton. and Miss Hade is a domestic who
h:is a hatrhot <-harpened for him.
JuriÃe ESllsworth'a court was the scene
of the trial of a suit to-day in which the
lady in auction claimed that Stevens
should be ordered to pay her two years'
â¢waees for acting as his housekeeper. In
her opinion S3O a month would be a rea
t-'nable oatnpecsmtioti for her services.
In the complaint there was no mention
of a proposed marriage, but Stevens so
testified and caused Miss Hade a deal of
embarrassment. He said the lady came
to his farm because she was too ill to do
regular work and that he gave her a home
Â¦until she was well. After a time, so
Stevens alleged, Cupid supported to Miss
Hade that it would be better all around if
they entered Into other relations than
those of employer and housekeeper, and
she proposed that they become riusband
and wife. Stevens saw things not in that
Ji^ht. so she left the place and sued for
iwo years' wapes.
JuciVre Ellsworth strimgrled mightily with
the problem and finally decided to allow
the plaintiff ?'y.. without costs.

S?ev. C. 0, 32 r own

platform. He mapped out a course as a
preacher of the gospel, and after some
years of study in an Eastern seminary re
turned to his native town and was imme
diately seized upon by the trustees of the
then struggling Central Christian Church.
The young preacher's methods attracted
instant attention and thousands flocked
to hear him. His first innovation was to
introduce Shakespeare as a corollary to
the Bible. In his Sunday evening dis
courses he presented with much dramatic
vigor selected readings from the great
tragedies.
He preached the doctrine that many
amusements deemed harmful were inno
cent, and he ran the gamut of the social
diversions of the day. Once he did a
waltz movement in the pulpit. And all
this time the charming soprano's pretty
eyes were fastened on the clever young
preacher. Cupid played havoc in that
choir, and even after the final crash
which left Pastor Davis without a pulpit
the dainty little songbird linked fortunes
with the deposed preacher, and they
were married.
At one time Davis came into the public
eye with a signed story of an interview he
secured with Fay Strahan Moore, who
was in jail for alleged complicity in a
blackmailing robbery of a wealthy New-
York hotel man. She was paid a few
years before to have been engaged to Da
vis during one of his lecture tours in Ore
gon.
Mrs. Davis is the daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. M. H. Kingore. Their home is at 58S
Twentieth street. Her father was for
merly an attorney here, being a law part
ner of Thomas V. Cator.
Mrs. Kingore opnoses her daughter's
divorce, but declares that the troubles, of
the couple may have forced such an Is
sue.

REV. KENNETH DUNCAN
IN THE DOCK AGAIN
Friends Intercede in His Behalf
and He May Be Placed
in Their Care.
w _, ENNETH DUNCAN, the fallen
JLs/ minister, whose career downward
P\^ has been one of the sad features of
z> local criminal annals, has one more
chance, and in the anticipation that it will
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 18, 1900.
materialize to-day Duncan was not given
sentence yesterday on the three . charges
of petty larceny that have been proved
against him. The idea now is to send him
to some private family in Ukiah, where
he can be taken care of and where, ii
there is anything left in him, he can. make
a new start.
His case was called In Judge Conlan's
court yesterday, and when he was told to
stand up to be sentenced Charles Mont
gomery came forward to plead for him.
Montgomery said that at heart Duncan
was a decent, honest man, but that drink
had got tho better of him, and until his
appetite had been controlled there was no
use trying to reform him. .To help. him
to control himself Montgomery proposed
that Duncan be allowed to go to Uklah.
and, while still under the jurisdiction of
the State Prison Commission, that he be
restrained there among friends, who would
do what they could in assisting him to re
form. He asked that Duncan's sentence
be put off for a few months until the re
sult of the experiment could be deter
mined. Montgomery said he had tried be
fore to reform Duncan, but so far he had
failed. He said, however, that he was
willing to try again, and he asked the
court to let him make the attempt. Judge
Conlan set the case over until to-morrow,
when he will announce his decision.
REV. C. 0. BROWN
LEAVES THE PULPIT
Practically Ostracised Since
He Was Mixed Up in the
Overman Scandal.
CHICAGO, April 17.â Rev. C. O. Brown,
who came from San Francisco three years
ago, has resigned as pastor of the Green
street Congregational Church. He gives
no reason, but it is well known that
Brown has been ostracised by the other
Congregational ministers since he visited
San Francisco and confessed the charge
of immorality with a young woman who
was a member of his former California
church.
Brown also withdraws from the min
istry.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
HIS Broadway. April 17.
JHE shadow of the divorce court is
upon ESwarfis Davis, one time pas
tor of the Central Christian Church.
and his wife, formerly Miss Alice
Kingore. a beautiful songstress, with
whom the young preacher fell head over |
heels in love when she was leading
soprano in the choir of his church. From
the East come? the story, practically veri- j
tied by the disclosures of unhappy marital [
affairs of the young couple, that Mrs. Da
vis has placed in her attorney's hands a
complaint for separation, charging her
spouse with desertion and failure to sup
port her.
In truth, after Edwards Davis aban
doned the pulpit In Oakland the pair wore
stranded jn New York. His plans for busi
ness in a secular field went all awry, and
finally the talented and accomplished
young wife put her ability to earning a
living for herself, and she went on the
stage and succeeded so admirably that
now. after a brief stay here with her
mother, she has decided to return to New
York and resume her work on the stage.
Her husband when last heard from was
doing a specialty with a touring minstrel
troupe In Florida. Last fall when Mrs.
Davis left New York her husband was in
Ohio.
Such Is the fate of one of the romances
which grew out of the clever but erratic
young cleric's career in Oakland. Eel

There were letters also from men.

POLICEMAN IS
INJURED BY A
RUNAWAY HORSE
Captain Thomson Meets
With a Very Serious Ac
cident in the Park.
Thrown to the Ground After Lassoing
the Frightened Animal, Which
Is Finally Captured by
Officer Arellanes.
A runaway horse in the park yesterday
afternoon was the cause of serious In
juries to Captain . Thomson of the park
police, which will result in that popular
officer's retirement from active duty for
some time to come. The accident further
demonstrates the mistake of the Phelan
administration in reducing the number of
patrolmen In a section sadly in need of
more police protection. About 4 o'clock
the animal, which had probably escaped
from some vacant lot near by, â¢ dashed
Into the park road at Sixth avenue. The
brute was not attached to a wagon and
was minus harness, and as he ran along
the road he became suddenly frightened
and tore along at a rapid rate.
The frenzied animal narrowly escaped
several pedestrians on the road, when he
was seen by Captain Thomson, who
chased after him on horseback. Thomson
tried to lasso the horse several times, but
was unsuccessful until he reached the
corner of Haight and Ashbury streets,
when his lariat threw the runaway horse.
The latter tugged hard at the rope and
succeeded in throwing Thomson to the
ground, where he lay unconscious for sev
eral minutes. The patrol wagon was sent
for and Thomson was taken to the Stan
yan-street station, where a cursory exam
ination disclosed that he had sustained
peveral , bruises and was considerably
shaken up. There was also a slight con
cussion of the brain. Thomson was finally
sent to his home to be treated.
In the' meantime the runaway horse had
regained his feet, and with Thomson's
lariat trailing behind him ran at a terrific
gait down the street. Officer Arellanes,
who had come up on the scene by that
time, went after the animal on his horse,
and after a few blocks' ride brought him
to a halt with his lariat.
That no one was injured In the park
during the mad run of the frightened ani
mal was a miracle. There was quite a
number of pleasure seekers almost In the
path of the runaway, but they fortu
nately escaped injury.
This Is the second time within a period
of two months that Thomson has received
injuries in the discharge of his duty. He
was severely hurt in an encounter with a
maddened buffalo several months ago and
had only recently recovered. The fact Is
that the park roads should be better pa
trolled than they are at present and tho
danger from similar accidents would be
reduced to a minimum.

DEMOCRATS ARE
PREPARING FOR
CAMPAIGN WORK
Seth Mann Calls a Meeting
of the State Central
Committee.
Members to Assemble May 5 and
Designate Time and Place of Hold
ing State Convention to Choose
National Delegates.
>
Seth Mann, chairman of the Democratic
State Central Committee, yesterday issued
a call directing the whole committee to
meet In this city: on Saturday, May 5. The
executive committee will meet at the Cali
fornia Hotel on Monday, April 30.
The general committee at its meeting
on May 5 will designate the time and
place of holding a State convention to se
lect eighteen delegates to represent Cali
fornia in the National Democratic Con
vention which will assemble at Kansas
City, Mo., on July 4. The committee will
also fix tho apportionment of delegates to
the State convention from the various
counties, and as a basis of representation
will probably take the vote cast for Bryan
in 1596. Should the vote cast for James G.
Magulre in 1858 be taken as the basis the
Democrats of San Francisco would lose
several delegates. The manner of choos
ing delegates to the convention will be an
nounced by the State Central Committee.
It is quite well understood that Jaspar
McDonald and his associates of the Dem
ocratic County Committee will appoint the
delegates to represent San Francisco In
the State convention. There Is no inten
tion on the part of the campaign man
agers to permit the rnnk and file of the
local Democracy to have a voice in the
i selection of representatives. The pro
gramme to appoint was devised to prevent
the voters of the party from expressing
their sense of shame and disgust for Phe
lan's administration. It Is apprehended
by the party manipulators that Demo
cratic voters would take advantage of the
primaries to elect delegates who would
go to Sacramento and openly denounce in
the convention the corrupt methods of th.c
Mayor. Therefore, in order to prevent
discord and strife In the beginning of the
campaign, it has been resolved to take
away from the voters of the party all op
portunity to express a choice in the selec
tion of their representatives. It Is a raw
programme. Seth Mann knows that it is
raw and Judffe Lawlor and others know
If, but they doubtless comprehend that
exigencies of the situation demand a de
parture from party customs and tradi
tions. -

Colonel L. L. Bromwell went to Los An
geles Tuesday night and has undertaken
to make all the necessary arrangements
at Los Angeles for the alliance delega
tion. D. W.. Kirkland and H. B. Boyn
ton, members of the alliance, who are
now residents of Los Angeles, will co
operate with Colonel Bromwell as a spe
cial committee at Los Angeles,
1 board of directors of the bank. The
ground dimensions of the new building
will be: Market street frontage 53 feet,
Geary street frontage 73 feet. The lot is
irregular In shape, and consequently the
depth of the building will vary from 53
feet on the east to 70 feet on the west.
The east line will be about 30 feet west
of the west line of Kearny street. The
structure will be thoroughly fireproof and
modern. To the height of two stories the
material employed will be granite and
above that, sandstone. The general style
will be monumental. The corners, lower
story and the roof line will be ornamen
tal, but the remainder will be plain. Tho
bank will be on the ground floor together
with a store, to be 20 feet wide and the
entire depth from Market to Geary
street. The bank will take the greater
part of the Market street frontage, but
there will be an entrance to the office ele
vators of handsome proportions. The
number of offices will be about 150. The
cost of the building will be about 5300,000.
There were nine architects in competition
for the work and premiums were awarded
to Messrs. Albert Pissis, Swayne & Van
Trees. The work of demolishing the old
buildings and the construction of the new
will begin as soon as all the working
plans are ready. The building will take
about one year to construct.
It was a belief among the Egyptians
that the third finger of the left hand was
connected with the heart by means of a
slender nerve. From that belief came the
custom of wearing the. wedding ring on
that finger.
