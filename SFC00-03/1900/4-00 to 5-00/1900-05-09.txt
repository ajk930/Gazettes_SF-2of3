LONTK3X. May 9. 4:10 a. m. â Four thousand British cavalry watered their horses at Zand River Monday, twenty-five
miles beyond Smaldeel, where Lord Roberts continues to date his dispatches. The scouts who have been searching
the country for miles along the stream have found no Boers south of the river. The Boers are laagered In un
known force en the north bank. Thus the British advance guard is within forty-five miles of Kroonstad.
The Fr&e Staters in the expectation that Kroonstad will speedily become untenable are, according to informa
tion fmm Lourenzo Marques, preparing to transfer their government to Heithbroh, a little more than fifty miles northeae:.
The proclamations of Lord Roberts appear to have little effect upon the inhabitants of the invaded districts. Every farm
is found deserted except by the wonven and children. All the men are awo.y fighting.
Correspondents at headquarters are now wiring freely concerning the incidents connected with the occupation of
Emaldcel. Some exasperation is expressed at the ease with which the Boers escaped with their transports before the
very eyes of the British. For instance, worn the British entered Smaldeel the Boer ox wagons coolly out-spanned only
five miles away, as if In contempt of the ability of the British to overtake them.
I-ord RoiKJits is described as rightly "unwilling to sacrifice his horse* for the sake of a comparatively minor ad
vantage." Nevertheless, the waste of horsefle?h, in spite of all precautions, is enormous. Smaldeel is a village of a
ecore of dwellings, but it expanded into a vast canvas city, and the glow of the camp fires look like a scene in an iron-
Eme.Iting district. The city is likely to fade away In a day by the immediate progress of the infantry to Zand River
The tld!ng3 from Mafeking are gloomier than ever. Everybody there has an empty stomach and a pinched face. The
natives are no longer given porridge, and the whites now have but a quart of that substance and a pound of horse sau
sage daily. Everything e !Â»e eatable has gone. Insufficient food, wet trenches and cold nights are deadly to the health
of the eurrison. This information comes from reliable natives. Lady Sarah Wilson, under date of April 27, says: "The
Boers now number 4500, including young Eloff. President Kruger's grandson, who has sent for six more guns."
The Xlafeking correspondent of the Times, who also emphasizes the extreme gravity of the situation says- "It
Is lmpcERlDle to ignore the fatal significance of Colonel Baden-Powell's reference to tne hardships endured by the women
and children, among whom many deaths have already occurred. The commissariat is holding a certain stock of food
stuffs in reserve for use In the direst extremity."
The British aclumn is reported to hive reached Tauncs. thirty miles north of Warrenton. According to Pretoria ad

umn Is moving toward Vryburg General Hunter Is apparently preparing an orderly advance northeast along the Vaal
River to participate in the Pretoria advance as Lord Roberts' left flank.
Capo Town correspondents iwn that an important movement in Natal la expected within the next four days. General
Duller Is rapidly completing his transport organization. " '
The President cf the Transvaal Volksraad reiterates President Kruger's undiminished tenacity of purpose. In the
course of debate he said that should be be sent to St. Helena the republican cause. would still go on. Generals Luis Botha

A dispatch from Maseru. B.irutoland. dated Tuesday, May 8, Fays: "Lord Roberts' rapid advance has confused tha
Boers who are holding the roads between Wepener and Clocolan. along which a continuous stream of wagons and cattle has
been proceeding northward for days. On Monday some of those countermarches and the herds got into an Inextricable
muddle, the Bo< n? not knowing which way to turn." *. Â¦ Â¦ *Â«_Â«-*uie
The Second Battalion went out later, and under Colonel G. H. Bullock did great service with Gen
eral Buller's forces in the several attempts to relieve the beleaguered garrison. When success finally
crowned tteir efforts no more cordial greetings were given than those that passed between the twobatch.es
Tfco First and Second Battalions of the Devonshire. Regiment (Eleventh) came together for the first
time in years when General Bulkr's army marched into Ladysmith, and the recognitions and greetings
of old comrades in arms made a very moving spectacle. The First Battalion, under Lieut. Col. J. H. Yule,
who succeeded General Symons at Dundee, and conducted the retreat to Ladysmith, -was in Natal at the
outbreak of the war, having- gone there from India, and, under Colonel 3. W. Park, bore a gallant part in
Sir Georg-e White's masterly defense of that town.

"SMALDEEL, May 8.â The railway

The Cape Town correspondent is slight

LUZON REBELS CAPTURE AND BURN BULAN
"I believe that United States Couit
Commissioner Heacock is right in the
remarks quoted in this morning"3
Call. There should be a check to ths
incursions of these coolie contract
laborers under the guise of nativa
born citizens of the United States,
and they should be examined on
board the steamer before they have
an opportunity of communicating
Â¦with, their friends on shore."
In speaking yesterday of the new and
important phase of the crusade, United
States District Attorney Coombs said:
If United States District Attorney
Coombs carries his point another blow
will have been dealt in the Chinese traffic
In this city. The yellow "citizens" will
not be admitted at this port, as United
States Commissioner Heacock has proved
beyond any question that he is scrupu
lously careful In the examination of Chi
nese.
sons" before Collector Jackson. If the
cases go into court in the manner which
the District Attorney now demands this
highly favored "lawyer." for whom the
Collector shows such friendship, could do
nothing, as he cannot practice In tha
United States courts.
Frank L. Coombs, the United States District Attorney.
Chinese witnesses to the penitentiary for
perjury.
If the officials of the Chinese Bureau,
who are under the direction of Collector
of the Port Jackson, and subject to hl3
decisions, refuse to do as District Attor
ney Coombs asks, then the District Attor
ney says he will present the entire matter
to the Department of Justice at Wash
ington. He will show how the ends of
Justice are being defeated by the refusal
of the Collector of the Port to examine
all Chinese immigrants and will ask for
an immediate remedy.
It is difficult to understand the position
taken by Collector of the Port Jackson.
After admitting more than 3000 "native
sons," he suddenly arrived at the conclu
sion that he had no right to do so and re
fused to handle any more cases. lie was
very well aware that a better plan, which
would assist and not cripple the United
States courts in their efforts to keep out
these contract laborers, Is to take the
statements of the "native sons"- as weH'aa
of the others, and then remand the
''coolie citizens", to the United States
courts. This Is the simplest and only
straightforward course to take. It would,
for example, make at least one member of
the ring seek another field of usefulness.

the distress caused by the struggle.

Riotous proceedings began almost im
mediately. When the company tried to
take cars out from the various barns of
the system the non-union men who had
undertaken the task were Immediately
surrounded and urged not to make the
attempt. If they persisted the cars were
surrounded by a howling mob, and as if
by magic sticks and stones filled the air,
forcing the men In charge to desert their
posts. During 'the fusillade windows in
the cars were, broken, while their sides
wouM be scarred and dented by the mis
siles. At first the storm centers were con
fined to these remote points. By and by
a few cars managed to slip away from
the crowds around the power houses and
car barns and made their way downtown.
Then the theater of activity was trans
ferred to Washington avenue. Locust
street and other downtown thoroughfares.
The same tactics were resorted to down
town that had proved so efficacious about
the barns. A crowd would surround each
car and while the boys and young men
would shout "scab" and "cheap crew"
at the motorman and conductor from fur
ther back In the throng would come a
volley of rocks and bricks, smashing the
windows and frightening the men In
charge from their posts. The most serious
personal Injuries sustained up to nightfall
were received in riots of this character,
which took place on Washington avenue,
from Sixth to Eighth streets. In one of
them a hoy was shot by a non-union con
ductor who was trying to push his car
through the crowd. In the fracas further
down a motorman was seriously Injured
by a brick thrown by some one in the
crowd.
A man was shot at Grand and Franklin
avenues to-night and still another man
was shot at 9 o'clock to-night near the
crossing of the suburban tracks on Tay
lor avenue.
As a suburban car was crossing Taylor
avenue a big crowd gathered. Some one
pulled the trolley from the wire and this
act so enraged a passenger, at present un
known, that he drew a revolver and
fired three shots into tho crowd. Bert
Gilbert, a barkeeper, an onlooker, received
one bullet in the arm and another in the
lung. He was taken to the City Hos
pital, where his wounds were pronounced
mortal.
The police were powerless to-day In the
face of the mob, which was augmented
at noon by thousands of clerks from
business houses and workmen from the
factories. Many . women, also, gathered
with the crowds. Boys and young men,
most of whom had no connection with the
strikers whatever, furnished most of the
noise and did a largo amount of the mis
chief downtown. There were compara
tively few of the strikers lrr the mob and
many of those who appeared most zeal
ous in the cause of the street railway men
were animated by no more ferocious feel
ing than the love of excitement.
Vehicles of all sorts were pressed into
service to-day by the citizens of the
town in getting to and from business.
Chairman Samuel W. Lee of the na
tional executive board, the man who Is
conducting the strike, said to-day that the
union was satisfied with the results of the
strike, '
"We struck to tie up the system." he
said, "and we have succeeded. The
company has precipitated this crisis .by its
refusal to treat with us. We are ready
at any time to: do our part toward set
tling the differences between us and the
company." \
Mr. Lee said he did riot know what the
strikers would do if the company should
hire new men. .The union claims > that
about 3400 men are out and that they rep
resent about 90 per cent of the transit
company's employes. .
ST. LOUIS. May 8.â The employes of
the St. Louis Transit Company,
numbering about SCOO men, made
good to-day their threat to tie up
the street railway traffic of the city.
In doing sÂ«o they not only paralyzed the
business of the company, which operates
all the electric and cable roads in the
city, with the Â« xception of tho?e owned
by the St. Louis and Suburban Railway
Company, on which a .strike has been in
progress for two weeks past, but brought

other lines of business ad well. It was

ANOTHER triumph has been won
in the crusade made by The Call
against the wholesale Importation
of ChineEe coolie contract labor
ers, who are swarming Into this
port in the guise of native-born citizens
of the United States. After mature de
liberation United States District Attorney
Frank L. Coombs Intends to take a hand
in the desperate game which the ChinesÂ©
ring, notwithstanding exposure and the
probability of worse consequences, con
tinues to play. District Attorney Coombs
intends to demand that Collector of the
Port John P. Jackson, through the
Chinese Bureau, examine every Chinese
who applies for admission to the United
States at this port. Each coolie shall be
examined and his statements be taken
before he leaves the ship upon which he
arrives.
Mr. Coombs says that the time has come
for him to use every endeavor to prevent
the gross frauds which are being per
petrated and to assist the United States
courts in the Berlous business of handling
the "native son" cases. The decision of
Collector Jackson not to consider "na
tive son" cases has given the scheming
lawyers, their Chinese middlemen and
perjured witnesses time and opportunity
In which to coach the yellow "natives."
Collector Jackson has done even more
than this to make possible the cheating of
the Federal laws. He has left the United
States courts absolutely without any tes
timony with which to trap the incoming
coolie3 and involve their Chinese wit
nesses in the contradictions which follow
from perjured and manufactured testi
mony. The door has been thrown wide
open to frauds of the grossest kind, and
District Attorney Coombs says that he
will do all in his power to close It.
He intends to demand of the officials of
the Chinese Bureau that they take a de
tailed, critical statement from every Chi
nese immigrant before he leaves the ves
sel upon which he arrives. Those Chinese

the offender. 'He said that it was his in

VANCOUVER. B. C. May S.-This city
has been thrown into a ferment* of ex

noon by a party of girls gathering ferna
at Etanley Park of the horribly mutilated
body of a man. The ghastly find was
concealed In a little clump of trees. The
head had been eevcred from the body.
The legs wore broken and lay in the moss
several feet from the trunk. No flesh re
m?ir.ed on the face or upon the upper
portion cf the remains, the ekull having
been picked clean by ccrrica Jiirds. No

accomplished by no animal. .

from the county physician. Dr. M. M. Shearer,
charging him with -improper conduct toward
her. Further the confided to the pastor that
Miss Bertha Sundcll, a nursÂ» at th* hospital,

after making Inquiry concerning: thÂ« soocl name

SAN FRAXCISCO. April 3, 19C0.â To the
Heard of Supervisor*, or Public, Whomever it
May concern In Santa Kosa. Oil.: I ha^e been
asked why I g-ave up my position as nurse and
matron In the Sonoma County Hospital. During
my time in the hospital I can say before God
and men that I have fulfilled my duty faith
fully, but o.ur County Physician. Dr. Shearer,
has insulted me whenever, he. cot the chance.
If I had to buy anything for the hospital I
always had to bo to the doctor's office for an
order. (Here follow particulars of an un
pleasant character.) Could I eay anything?
No. I would have lost my position, so I
simply resinned before he got a chance to throw
me out. I don't think that any respectable
woman can hold her position while Dr. Shearer
is in the hospital. I know 1 have tried hard,
but to my sorrow I had to give it up. Â¦

Betworn~jiDO and 430 men were at work in the shafts, where giant powder or fire damp or dust or all three exploded
in one shaft, killing scores of the entombed men. while, the back damp suffocated nearly all of those working in an ad
joining shaft. Only a few of the men, warned hy the rumble of the explosion, rushed from the. mine in time to escape
the deadly damp. Two hundred and fifty dead bodies were taken out of the mine by the rescue party.
The above diagram shows the different levels tapping the veins of coal in which the men were working when the
explosion occurred. The black stripes indicate the coal. veins. The men killed outright by the shock of the explosion
were in Level No. 1 and the galleries above it. Most of those in the lower levels, and in an- adjoining shaft were BUf

distant rumble of the explosion, escaped by the lower level shown in the diagram before the suffocating gases could

XEW YORK. May 8.â The Pennsylvania
Railroad, not content with absorbing the
various competing lines in its ambition to
merit the title, 'â¢standard railway of the
world." has planned a gigantic project
that will bring Europe seven or eight
hours nearer all American cities. Eventu
ally there will be constructed k tunnel
undT the harbor at a point called "the
Narrows." Trains will cross from Eliza
beth, Ni J-. to Staten Island, thence to
Long Island (under "the Narrows"), thence
across a proposed bridge at Wards
Island to connect with the New York,
New Haven and Hartford Railroad to
Eos t on.
The greatest secrecy is maintained by
oftieials of this conservative corporation
as to the details of the plans. What is
evidently in view is an all-rail route from
the prlnicipal commercial cities of the
countryâ all now reached by lines *f this
systemâ to a steamship terminus at
Montauk Point. There is also projected
connection with lines from Boston and
east by way of Long Island and Staten
Island to the Pennsylvania Railroad near
Elizabeth.
The Pennsylvania has entered into a
contract, said to involve an expenditure
ox millions, for the construction of a
great pier that will go nearly two miles
out Into the bay. President Cassatt has
written to the Secretary of War asking
tne Government to put its harbor line
two thousand feet further into the bay
to permit this great construction. The
Pennsvlvania owns control of the Amer
ican Steamship Line.
It was Austin Corbin's plan twenty
years ago to establish a pier in the ocean
near Montauk and the Joint holders
of Pennsylvania and American line stock
now appreciate his foresight and will
carry out his project. Improvements in
mechanical equipment have materially
lessened the length of the trans-Atlantic
passage. It Is reasonable to estimate
that at least seven hours Â¦would be saved
if steamers ran from Montauk instead of
from Xew York down through the tortu
ous channels of the lower bay. What
this projected improvement means then Is
a quicker trip, by eight hours, for the host
of people that leave the cities on the line
of the Pennsylvania and go to Europe.
More important still is the. tremendous cut
in the time it takes to get mall across the
Atlantic.
By Meeting Incoming Steamers at
Montauk Point at Lsast Eight
Hours Could Be Saved in
Crossing Atlantic.

FOR WELL PEOPLE
An Easy Way to Keep WelL
It Is easy to keep well If we would only
observe each day a few simple rules of
health.
The all-important thing Is to keep t .Â«
stomach right and to do this it Is not
necessary to diet or to follow a set rule or
bill of fare. Such pampering simply makes
a capricious appetite and a feeling that
certain favorite articles of food must be
avoided. ,
Professor Wlechold gives pretty good
advice on this subject. He says: "I am
6S years old and have never had a serious
illness, and at the same time my life h.n
been largely an Indoor one, but I early
discovered that the way to keep healthr
was to keep a healthy stomach, not tv
eating bran crackers or dieting 1 of as-
sort; on the contrary I always eat what
my appetite craves, but for the past eight
years I have made it a dally practice t->
take one or two of Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets after each meal and I attribute
my robust health for a man of my age to
the regular daily use oX Stuart's Tablets.
"My physician first advised me to u<=*
them because he said they were perfect-
ly harmless and were not a secret patent
medicine, but contained only the natural
digestives, peptrmea and diastase, and
after using them a few weeks I hav<s
never ceased to thank him for his advice.
"I honestly believe the habit of taking
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets after meals 13
I tho real health habit, because their use
brings health to the sick and ailing: and
preserves health to the well and strong."
Men and women past 50 years of ag<Â»
n?ed a safe digest tv* after meals to. ln-
i sure a perfect digestion end tr> ward of?
disease, ami the safest, best-known and
most widely used is Stuart'3 Dyspepsia
Tablets.
They are found in every wÂ»ll-regu!ated
household from Maine to California and
in Great Britain and Australia are rapidly
pushing their way into popular favor.
! All drusplsts sell Stuart a Dyspepsia
| Tablets, full-sized packages, at 50 cents,
I and for a weak stomach a 50-cent pack-
I age will often do $50 worth of good.

have been the principal topic of conver

the papers have scarcely alluded to the
matter. The Department of Posts admits
a shortage of $"i5,000, but further investl-
Kation has brought to light the fact that
in July of last year the receipts showed

SAN JOSE, May S.-T.he , fight to-night
Owing to the prevalence of smallpox no
spring elections were held in two Ohio
towns, the officials holding over.
Ryan told an intimate friend this after
noon that he thought the light would go
ten rounds at least, and he believed that
Corbett would hang desperately In the
ring aÂ» long as there was a single chance
of possible victory.
Corbett, training at Lakewood, Bald to
day: . .
"Brady says Jeffries Is hurt because I
said he was a very light champion, and
thinks now he will go In and whip me
quickly. \ Well, he's got another think
coming. I still believe that he has no
business with the championship, and he
will neither whip me quickly nor whip me
at all." . . â¢
The ex-champion does not seem In the
least worried now that he is sure the fight
will take place on Friday night as sched
uled. He goes about his work like a man
who is sure of good results. His confi
dence in his 'Â¦ability to win is not false.'
He believes he is lucky in beings consid
ered the "outsider" In the fight and feels
that his victory will come as a surprise to
the whole pugilistic world. ;
' Gus Ruhllrx Corbett's trainer, says:
"I am willing right now to put myself
on record "that no man ever entered the
ring in any better condition to fight than
Corbett is to-day. He is by far the clev
erest man I ever boxed with, and besides
that he can slug with any man living. I
believe that Corbett will beat Jeffries in
side of twenty rounds." , : ;
- Here Is what Jeffries* trainer, Tommy
Ryan,, says: ,- .
Â¦- "I have â¢ trained Jeffries for his last
three encounters in the ring. I have boxed
with him constantly for months, and I can
'say with Â¦ perfects truthfulness that" he
grows better and faster every day. Phys
ically Jim Jeffries is a perfect fighter. His
science I consider now fully equal to Cor
bett's. <'; The boiler-maker Is a different
man - than > when he faced Sharkey. The
public ought not to Judge Jeffries by that
contest." ..'..;.
Speaking of the French offer to exhibit
in Paris, Jeffries said he was in the hands
of Brady, and if he won the fight with
Corbett, Brady might mal:Â« any arrange
ments he saw proper In regard to his fu
ture movements. *
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. May 8.-At V Asbury
Park Champion Jeffries had a five
mile run on the road and a rub
down this morning. The boiler
maker says he believes Corbett is
In better condition than ho has been for
years, and that he will try to put up a
stiff fight. Tommy Ryan seems to think
Corbett has a recollection of Jeffs tight
with Sharkey and that his confidence of
success is based on the idea that Jeffries
will adopt the tactics he_ did in that bat
tle. Jeffries was very much Irritated over
Corbett'n action in regard to the referee.
He said he had hoped the matter was set
tled and that Charlie White was as sat
isfactory to Corbett as he was to him.

chief among them was the announcement

Wheeler first spoke of the' literature of
fly-casting, tracing it back gradually un
til he found a quotation in the New Tes

views, and. eloquently plcads^the cause of
his champion.
Merits of Stevenson.
The friends of Mr. Stevenson call atten
tion to the fact that he has not oniy once
been t-lecttd Vice President but that ne has
kiso made a record us a greenbacker. Mr.
Tovvnes supporters meet tnese arguments
by pointing to Towr.e's record as a silver
advocate and assert that he would make
a eai.-.paien equal to that of Bryan him
self. They are met on this point Dy tne
argument "that the Democrats would never
acctpt him as a nominee because of his
Kepublican proclivities.
isiill another proposition which has been
made â and this is advocated by Delegates
Washburn and Brown of Massachusetts â
Is tliat the convention should name sev
eral persons, any one of whom would be
acceptable to the Populists as a Vice
Presidential candidate, and appoint a com
mittee to confer with the Democrats as to
which of thÂ« m should be placed upon the
ticket. This proposition is apparently
gaining in favor, but is not yet as strong
as either the suggestion in Towne's behalf
or the one to avoid ar.y nomination what
ever.
Some of the delegates, notably those
from Nebraska ar.d Missouri, are advanc
ing the idea that the convention as a
whole should adjourn immediately upon
convening, to meet in Kansas City on the
came day that the Democratic and Silver
Republican conventions are to assemble
there.
"If v.-e are to have a committee of con
ference," said a Missouri delegate in dis
cussing the proposition, "why not have
the whole convention act in that ca
pacity? For my own part I can see no
reason for holding the convention in ad
vance of the Democratic convention, and
bavins mr.de a mistake in calling it so
early 1 think the best way to correct the
error would be to transfer the entire as
sembly to Kansas City and have it meet
there with the other conventions to be
held in Mr. Bryan's behalf."
He went on to say that he did not sup
pose the attendance of all the delegates
could be obtained, but he felt sure that
many of them would go; and, he conclud
ed, this was altogether the best way to
settle the difficulty. It should be added
that tliis suggestion is not generally ac
cepted as one likely to be carried into
execution.
Spirited Fight Brewing.
The delegates have not yet rVached the
point of talking openly on the question of
a Vice Presidential nomination, but there
is a growing feeling on this subject, and
unless a means is found of harmonizing
the sentiment before the Vice Presidential
nomination is reached In the order of
business there will almost certainly be a
very spirited fight over that point.
It is already apparent that the attend
ance at the convention will not be as
large as had been counted upon. The re
duction of rates by the railroads extended
to the East only as far as New York and
to the West only to Montana, probably
cutting off the attendance of many dele
gates and visitors from the Pacific Coast
and also, possibly, some delegates from
the Nev: England States. A majority of
the States-% however, will be represented
by delegates. If not by visitors. Chair
man Butler expresses the opinion that all
the States and Territories will be either
wholly or partially represented, except
Alabama, Arkansas. Mississippi. Georgia,
Florida. Vermont, Xew Hampshire and
Rhode Island.
There probably will be some contest
over the position of national chairman.
State Chairman Edmiston of Nebraska is
a candidate for the position, and appar
entlv has the support of Nebraska's
neighboring States. Senator Butler has
not yet announced whether he will be a
candidate for re-election.
Â¦ The weather man now makes a favor
able promise for the opening cf the con
vention. The skies are perfectly clear and
there Is apparently no danger e.xcept from
wind. There has been a stiff breeze blow-
Ing to-day, and It split two sections of the
huge tent in which the convention is to
be held. This incident, oftcourse, causes
feme apprehension as to th? result In case
of a repetition of to-day's weather condi
tions after the assemblage of the conven
tion.
MAY SEEK TO LEAD
MIDROAD PROCESSION
CINCINNATI, Ohio. May S.-At a pro
tracted meeting to-night of the national
committee of the middle-of-the-road Pop
ulists plans were perfected for the routine
business of the national convention,
which will be called to order, in Robin
son's Opera-house at 1 o'clock to-morrow
afternoon. Former Congressman Hpward
of Alabama wll be recommended to the
convention for temporary chairman. After
the appointment of the credentials com
mittee the convention will resolve itself
into an "experience meeting." T,his will
be for the benefit cf the members of the
committee on resolutions. It will be the
endeavor of the leaders to hear an expres
sion of opinion on the part of every State
represented before the resolutions com
mittee goes to work. It Is probable the
speech-making will be cortTlnued at the
night session; that on Thursday morning
the resolutions committee will report and
that nominations will then be taken up.
Jgnatius Donnelly's boom for the Presi
dential nomination presented a rather
healthy appearance this evening, but
there was little mention of a candidate
for Vice President In case Mr. Donnelly
should be selected for first place. Until
late this evening Mr. Donnelly had not
openly declared his wish to be placed at
the head of the ticket, but to-night it was
asserted that he had made the definite
announcement of his candidacy. He had
all alorg expressed a willingness to ac
cept first place if the convention desired
him to do so. but said he was not urging
his own merits.
* Another surprise was the presentation
of the namrs of former Congressman M.
W. Howard of Alabama for President
and D. Clem Deaver of Nebraska for
Vice President. This combination found
a great deal of favor among the varioua
delegations not controlled by Barker or
Donnelly, and at a caucus "this evening
of the Nebraska delegation the forty-six
votes from that State were pledged to
Howard and Deaver. The situation is
thus greatly complicated, making predic
tions for the Presidential ticket mere
guesswork.
Reports made by Secretary Jo A. Par
ker to the National Committee at its
meeting this evening showed that nearly
700 delegates have already arrived in the
city. Every State in the Union, with the
exception of North and South Carolina
and Vermont, will be represented.
Secretary Parker's report in the matter
of ; expenses was an astonishing docu
ment. It showed that the work of or
ganizing the middle-of-the-road conven
tion, which has been carried on since the
split at Lincoln on February 39, has cost
less than $800. This sum includes all the
expenses of the convention' In this city
and showed the smallest outlay of any
national convention of its size in the his
tory of the country. Chairman Deaver of
the national committee expressed him
self as well pleased with the record made,
but declared emphatically that he would
not accept the position of national chair
man for the ensuing four years.

SIOUX FALLS. S. D.. May 8.-The in
crease cf delegates and the approach to
tho time of calling the National Populist

the differences of opinion among the dele
gates as to the policy to be pursued with

becomes more and more evident that this
Is practically the oniy question which
the convention will have to decide, and It
Is occupying thÂ« attention of delegates
and visitors alike so exclusively as to
render the situation quite monotonous
on that account. There is occasional ref

stood that a few of the long-headed lead
ers have been drawing up plans and 6Ug-
Crstlr.g propositions for incorporating in

tljjs is true, the great majority of persons

this afternoon, but none of them reached
any definite conclusion.
Tec greatest difference of opinion
araong the delegates from States Is
ehown in Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa and
Missouri delegates. Nebraska delegntes
feel that th^y are In a peculiarly deli
cate position, because they are especially
anxious to sjbpfn-e the interests of Mr.
Uryan. They held two meeting's during
tne day, but faiU-d to reach a decision,
and will meet again to-morrow at 3
o'clock for- further consideration as to
what course to pursue. Senator Allen,
who may considered the leader of tho
delegation, a-s he is also the special cham
pion of Mr. Bryan, js exercising himself
especially to secure that action which
Â«r*a most certainly reiound to Bryan's
boneflu A majority of the delegates from
Xebraska are apparently favorable to the
reference of tht whole question to a com
mittee of one from "ojcti Slate, to be ap
i?ointÂ«d to confer with the Democrats at
Kansas City, and It is believe J that Sen
ator Allen is in accord with this se.nl
ment. Jn his exhortations to the delega
tions he has dv/eit especially upon the im
jiortance or avoiding in* 1 complication
>v.*iich the nomination of Watson for Vice
President caused in ls&i, the inference be
ing that he believes that any nomination
iii this :ln;Â» would be liable to cause a
sirniiar complication in the coming cam
j^ai^-n.
Populist Senators Disagre*.
Jn this position Senator Alien is sharply
antagonized by Senator Iiutler of North
Carolina and Senator Pottigrew of this
State. It may be said, in fact, that the
l*r.itf<l States Senators who are present
are facing conflicting: opinions on this
all-absorling question, and it begins to
look up if they would carry their differ
ences into tlxc convention itself. In case
they do the convention will be by no
mÂ« ans a monotonous affair. Thomas M.
Patterson of the Colorado delegation is
ii T>eal' us supporter of the proposition to
r..ime a. conf-Tenee committee and not
Dominate a Vice Presidential candidate.
Jle is an experienced and tactful parlla
mt-ntarian and will brine much strength
to that side of the controversy in case it
fchouid be opened in the convention.
The Colorado delegation,, numbering
thirty-eight mc-mbers, held a meeting to
day and decided to stand out for a con
ference committee. Butler and Pettigrrew
arc unquestionably exerting their utmost
endeavors i'.i iieralf cf Mr. Towne. and.
vtii'r- Â«/iÂ«ry appreciate that there are still
r.'.any obstacles to overcome, they express
â¢ nems'lves in private conversation as
>cunfident of success.
One straw showing the. way the wind
blows is found in a vote which was taken
on tÂ»ie special train coming from Omaha
this morning'. Two cars containing sixty
eiglu d*iegates were canvassed, and of
the sixty-t-ight votes cast fifty-eight were
favorable to Towne. There is, however,
among those who believe in the wIecjoto of
ijnminct'ng a candidate some opposition
to Mr. Towne.
There is a certain element , led by Gen
eral Weaver of Iowa, which is advocating
the nomination of a straight Populist
ticket, vhile there are others still who ex
press the opinion that if a candidate other
than a Populist is to be nominated he
should be a man of Democratic proclivi
ties, so as to make sure of -his indorse
ment by the Democratic convention. In
this connection some of the Illinois dele
gates have sussfsted ex-Viee President
Adlai K. Stevenson. There Is also pres
ent a gentleman from New York who is
circulating very industriously among the
delegates in the interest of Congressman
Sulzcr. He assure? them that Mr. Sulzer
Is In accord with many of the Populist

FAMILIAR OLD
WAR CLOUD IN
SERVICE AGAIN
Paris Editor Predicts Strife
Between America and
Germany.
PARIS, May S.â The Patrie. an after
noon Nationalist newspaper, classed as
sensational, in a dispatch from London to
day, claims to have discovered the real
reason for the friendly attitude of Em
peror William cf Germany toward Great
Britain at the present Juncture. It de
clares it to be the German Emperor's be
lief that war between Germany and the
United States Is possible, and, in view
of that contingency, he wishes to win
over Great Britain to neutrality. Continu
ing, The Patrie recalls the friction ranged
by the action of the German naval com
mander Admiral Diedncns, at *Â»ian.ia.
and affirms that the opposition of the
United States to Emperor William's
dream of founding a greater Germany in
Brazil and Argentina Is responsible for
the coldnes in the relations between the
two countries. It concludes: -
"War between America and Germany
is, therefore not impossible In the near
future, and It is In view of this war, and
not with hostile Intentions toward Eng
land, that Germany Is making unheard-of
efforts to Increase her navy. In the In
terval the sole aim of German policy is
to prevent an Anglo-American alliance.
There is 1 the secret of Emperor William's
attitude, for 11 England believed In a coal
ition of the powers against her she would
not hesitate to conclude a Yankee alli
ance. The Emperor, therefore, is striving
to appear devoted to England In order to
more surely realize his dream and make
Brazil and Argentina future dependencies
of the German Empire."

"Warspite at Monterey.
MONTEREY, May 8.â The British
cruiser TVarspite left here this afternoon,
after forty eight hours' stay, going direct
to Esquimault. B. C.
ance with instructions from the Fire
Chief, the management had Increased the
number of exits at the theater so that the
building can now be emptied under ordi
nary conditions in five minutes' time; also
the general precautions against fire had
been arranged to the patisfaction of the
Fire Department. He would stand ready
to report to Mr. de Young what changes
the Supervisors thought necessary to
make the theater perfectly safe.
On behalf of the management of
Fischer's Music Hall, Mr. Samuel3 asked
that the ordinance be changed so as to
make Borne distinction between theaters
and places like Fischer's, because in the
latter class of places, where refreshments
are served. It is impossible to fasten the
seats to the floor and make a hard and
fast rule, as it is proposed to do with the
playhouses.
When they got to discussing technicali
ties in the arrangement of theaters the
Supervisors found that they were in a
'helpless tangle, and they were glad to
.accept the invitation of Mr. Deane to
Â¦meet again to-day at the Alcazar Theater
iwith their printed regulations and charts.
THERE was a conference yesterday
afternoon between the members of
the Fire and Judiciary committees
of the Board of Supervisors and the
managers of some of the theaters upon
the ordinance now being framed to better
regulate the construction of theaters and
their interior arrangement, so that the
danger from flre or panic will be reduced
to a minimum. Chairman Brandenstein
of the committee acted as chairman, and
there were present besides him Supervi
sors Maguire. Curtis and Tobin, Commis
sioner of Public: Works Manson, Chief of
Police Sullivan and Assistant Fire Chief
Shaughnessy Manager \V. H. I^eahy
of the Tivoli Theater was the only theat
rical man present, but the Alcazar The
ater was represented by John Deane and
Fischer's Music Hall by R. Samuels.
Some time ago the Fire Committee
made an inspection of all the theaters In
town, and their report, printed at the
time, called attention to the fact that the
Tivoli, Alcazar and Grand Opera-house
Commissioner Manson explained to the
gentlemen present the main features â¢ of
the new ordinance, illustrating his talk
by means of a big chart showing the
ground plan of a model fireproof theater.
He paid that th* ordinance would not only
apply to theaters and places of public
amusement In the fire limits, but through
out the entire city.
Messrs. Leahy, Deane and Samuels
took part in the general discussion, as did
also Assistant Fire Chief Shaughneesy
and Chief of Police Sullivan. Deane con
fessed that he did not know much about
theaters, as he only represented M. H. de
Young's property interests. He paid that
during the past twelve months, in accord-
â¢were not arranged with reference to exits
and fire protection bo that they could
come within the terms of the ordinance
it is proposed to frame governing such
matters. The wish of the Supervisors, as
Chairman Brandenstein explained yester
day, is to talk over matters with the man
agers of the various playhouses, and to
give them every opportunity of under
standing and complying with the ordi
nance before it goes Into effect.

A treat Is In store for those who are
fond of sports of the field or stirring ac
tion where men and horses are the cen
tral figures. The men of Burllngame
Country Club, pronounced as fine horse
men as are to be found In any land, are
to play polo to-morrow afternoon on the
athletic grounds. Golden Gate Park. Game
will be called at 3:45 p. m. As play will
not be concluded until 5 o'clock it 1b ex
pected many men of affairs will find an
opportunity of seeing at least one period
of the game.
The Burlingame men are fresh from the
polo fields of Southern California, where
they swept everything before them. Their
ponies were fleeter of foot than those of
the southland and their game had a dash
and abandon that' swept everything before
it. The result was that scores were gen
erally one-sided, and the colors of the
San Mateo County clubmen were always
carried to victory. â¢ The teams as made
up are as follows:
Reds. Positions. Whites.
Charles Dunphy No. 1 C. Raoul-Duval
Lawrence Waterbury..No. 2.... J. S. Tobln
Walter S. Hobart No. 3 "Tom" Drlscoll
R. M. Tobln No. 4 John Lawson
Lawrence "Wfiterbury, who will-play on
the "Reds" with Walter S. Hobart, is one
of the great players of the East, having
been a member of some of the crack
teams there. 'Â¦ "Tom" Driscoll, the left
handed wlelder of the polo mallet, who
would rather play than eat, has cast in
his lot with the "Whites," where his reck
less daring should result in numerous
goals. '
No fee of any description le exacted
from those who may wish to view the
game. The ladies of the Burlingame con
tingent will probably view the game from
their four-in-hand coaches, which Â¦\*111 be
lined up along the south drive.
Edward I. Tobin and Peter D. Martin
will alternate as referee and umpire.

FOR THE FIRST TIME
Dr. Dodge's Deputies Axe on the Trail
of All Coursing Men "With Ken
nels in This County.
Assessor Washington Dodge is after the
coursing men. He has sent out a deputy
who has an acquaintance with the own
ers of greyhounds, and the latter are be
ing served with notices to call on the As
sessor and settle. The largest kennels,
those having upward of 200 greyhounds,
are not located In this county ,Â»-but a large
number of small owners are affected. It
Is estimated that there are over 2500 grey
hounds of ail ages scattered throughout
the city.
The dogs are to be taxed as are horses,
cattle, sheep or other animals at so much
on each one hundred dollars' valuation.
Greyhounds have never appeared among
the itemized list of things assessable, and
the new move of Assessor Dodge has
proved a surprise to the coursing men. It
Is expected they will comply with the law,
adding their mite to the receipts of the
municipality.

CHICAGO. May 8.â Tom Sharkey. at
Tattersall's to-night, knocked out Joe
Choynski of California in two rounds. The
fighting was of the hurricane order, both
men landing repeatedly, but Sharkey had
the fight well in hand throughout.
The knock-out blow was a left jolt to
the Jaw Just as the bell sounded for the
end of the second round. Choynski tried
to respond when the third round was
called, but when he attempted to arise he
fell over on his back on the rtoor and Kef-
Ih ee I? 1 * 1 * 011 ' H Â°san awarded the light to
The men met for a six-round go at catch
weights. ChoynBki weighed about 165 and
the Bailor 185 pounds. Tom O'Kourke, Bob
Armstrong and Jack Root were In dhar
key 8 j corner. Choynski's interests were
â¢poked after by the Schrosbee family. The
betting ranged at 3 to 1 that Chbynski
would not last the six rounds and even
money that Sharkey would win on a
knock-out.
_\Vhen they came to the center 'or the
first round &harkey Immediately started
hostilities and did not give Choynski a
moment's rest .for the entire three min
utes, slugging him all over the ring and
knocking Joe down twice. Sharkey him
self tripped down twice near the end of
the round from the force of his own
blows, but finished the round in good
shape, while Choynski was platnly suffer
ing from Sharkey's terrific bombardment
of the 6tomach. ; .
In the second round Choynski tried to
keep away, but Sharkey kept coming per
sistently and forced his opponent to make
a stand. Choynaki landed several sting
ing lefts on the sailor's face, but Sharkey
paid little attention to them and kept bor
ing in with all his strength. The blows
Sharkey was landing on the Californian
wore him down gradually and Choynski
was unable to protect himself in the ex
changes. When sent to the floor he would
not take advantage of the count, but would
Jump up Just as soon as he hit the floor.
Finally Sharkey in One of the mixes got
a straight right to the stomach, which
doubled up his adversary. Then the sailor
became like a madman and lunged at
Chcyuskl, forcing his slender opponent on
the ropes. Choynski tried to flght back,
but he was too weak, and after withstand
ing the hardest kind of punishment finally
succumbed. Sharkey was well pleased
with'the result and danced a Jig as Choyn
ski was being counted out.
After six rounds of mediocre fighting
Jim Hall, the old-time Australian, was
given the decision over Tim Scanlan of
Pittsburg in one of the preliminaries.
Billy Stift and Barney Connors fought six
fast rounds to a draw.

BERKELEY, May 8.â Mrs. Agnes
Graves, wife of Fred Graves, a conductor
on the Berkeley local train, was found
dead to-night by her husband upon his
return home from work. The couple re
side at 2113 Vine street.
Graves reached home about 7:30 o'clock.
Not finding his wife preparing supper he
searched the place and discovered her
body on a bed. Physicians were called,
and they could do nothing but pronounce
the woman to be dead. The case was re
ported to the Coroner. While there was
no external evidence of suicide, the cir
cumstances surrounding ihe death were
such as to raise a doubt as to the cause.
Mrs. Graves was Agnes Kelly when she
married Fred Graves, about two years
ago. Because of her indulgence in liquor
Graves brought suit for divorce from her
nearly a year ago, but later the action
was dismissed. While only 25 years old
Mrs. Graves had suffered much from an
apparently uncontrollable desire for in
toxicants, and If death were from natural
cause it is suspected that heart disease
was the trouble. Mrs. Graves had ex
hibited no suicidal tendencies and noth
ing was found -in the shape of letters or
papers to indicate that she had done away
with herself. . "
An autopsy will be held to-morrow" to
determine, the cause of death. . Â¦ .-. .

but when San Francisco was reached they
asked for "trimmings/' They absolutely
refused to work unless tney could pass

the only work was to "clean up" and
"this was not legitimate work because the
mail boat was not alongside the wharf,"
according to the strikers. The men were
brought up before the captain and he
fined each one of them three days' pay.
Yesterday there was a lively time while
the vÂ«:ssel was being paid off, but the
United States Shipping Commissioner held
that the firemen had committed a gross
violation of the law and that the fine must
stand. All* the firemen and coal passers
on the Alameda quit, and on her next trip
the mail steamer will go out with a non
union crew.
Cleveland Under a Jury Rig.
The steamer Cleveland, now being over
hauled and made ready for the Nome
trade, had a hard time of it while on her
way here from Hawaii. Her thrust shaft
broke and several minor accidents hap
ppned, but nevertheless the stout old craft
weathered them all, made port without
assistance, and after an overhauling came
on to San Francisco as though nothing
had happened.
Tugs were sent out from Honolulu to
look for the disabled steamer, but Cap
tain Klltgard was not Idle In the mean
time. He made sails out of tarpaulins
and other material. In this way he sailed
his vessel into Hilo while the tugs were
vainly searching the ocean for the Cleve
land. It was a clever piece of work and
shows that the old Cleveland in spite of
her appearance can sail and steam and
keep afloat when many a better looking
craft would go down.

Tax Collector Scott made an official de
mand yesterday on the Pacific Telephone
Company for moneys due the city under
an old ordinance Imposing a license tax
on nickel electrical machines, and also
under the order recently passed by the
Board of Supervisors providing a license
of 50 cents per quarter on all telephone
boxes. Secretary F. W. Eaton, who re
ceived service of the notice in the ab
sence of John I. Sabin. president of the
company, who Is In Portland, refused
peremptorily to pay any license, and ass a
result of his refusal, at the request of the
Tax Collector, District Attorney Byington
instructed Warrant Clerk Perry to pre
pare warrants for the arrest of Eaton.
In accordance with a letter sent to the
company last week Deputy Tax Collector
Edward J. Casey waited on the officials of
the telephone company yesterday morn
ing and made three demands on Secretary
Eaton. The first was for the payment of
$2 per quater on each nickel telephone ma
chine operated by â¢ the company since
January 8. 1900. the date of Scott's as
sumption of office. The second demand
was for an. Itemized statement of the
number of telephones now and heretofore
maintained by the corporation, and the
third was for the payment of the license
of 50 cents per rjuarter due under the new
order passed by the Board of Supervisors
on April 2. To each of the demands Eat
on, through his attorneys. PHlsbury and
Sutro, entered an emphatic protest, and
the swearing out of the warrant was the
next move made at the instance of Tax
Collector Scott.
Eaton, in explaining his refusal to com
ply with the Tax Collector's demand, said
that It was the Intention of the telephone
company to test the legality of the ordi
nances in the courts.
"We contend," said Eaton, "that the
Board of Supervisors has no right to im
pose a - license on our nickel machines.
Our attorneys are preparing a line of de
fense, and we will follow the case up to
the last court cf appeals."
Tax Collector Scott, however. Intends to
make it warm for Eaton. Scott says that
Eaton's refusal to comply. with the legal
demand is clearly a misdemeanor and Is
punishable by a fine of $100.
"Whether Mr. Eaton Is convicted or
not," says Scott. "I shall continue to de
mand the payment of the licenses, and
should he refuse I shall continue to pro
cure warrants for his arrest."
On the revenue cutters the pay has been

OAKLAND, May 8.â Tho annual meet
ing of the members of the Merchants'
Exchange, held this evening at their
rooms in the Central Bank building, was
enlivened with an address by John P.
Irish antagonistic to the policy of consoli
dation.
"I am opposed to the consolidation
scheme." he said, "because I believe it la
not for the best interest of the city. The
city of Oakland is too big already. I be
lieve in taking it as it is and making it
the greatest, cleanest and best municipal
ity In the State. I would far rather have
people coming across the border line from
Contra Costa reach Sixteenth street and
on finding a beautiful park there be told
they had arrived in Oakland, than to have
them told they were In Oakland before
they got out of the slaughter-house at
rnopphere near that border line.
"When we have reached a stage some
where near perfection it will be time
enough to talk of consolidation. How
ever, while the majority of the members
of the exchange differ from me in opin
ion, I desire to compliment you for your
work in the past, for you have wrought
mightily for the welfare of the city."
Colonel Irish was followed by ex-Mayors
John L. Davie and W. R. Davis and by
A. A. Denison In brief speeches favoring
the proposed plan of consolidation. Di

Edwin F. Smith, Namsd for Secretary
of Their Convention, Voted
for McKinley.
Politicians of the Bryan stripe are ad
vised that the Democratic State Central
Committee, Seth Mann, chairman, has se
lected Edwin F. Smith for secretary of
the State convention of the party. The
Bryanites are remonstrating and roaring
with Indignation. They assert that Smith
voted for McKinley in 1S96 and predict
that he will vote for McKinley this year.
Seth Mann was asked yesterday
whether E. F. Smith had received the ap
pointment. He replied that Smith had
performed the duties of secretary for the
last two Democratic conventions. He fan
cied that the convention would accept the
services of the men recommended by the
local committee. The Bryanites are posi
tive that Smith's appointment has al
ready been made, \\ord came to them
that the name of another was mentioned
but that Chairman Mann said Smith had
been appointed.
The position Is not one of tremendous
responsibility, and the emoluments are
not great enough to bring out an army of
hunters for the place, yet the free-silver
Democrats who are conducting Bryan's
campaign !n California contend that a
Bryan silverite should get the Job.

THERE was a blazo of Jewelry In
the office of Captain of Detectives
Seymour yesterday. Laid out on
his desk were Jewels which,
though there were only four
pieces, were worth a sum of money suffi
cient to stock a small jewelry store. The
display of diamonds and pearls consti
tuted the major part of the Jewels that
were stolen last Friday from the Crocker
residence at Burlingame.
Chief of Detectives Desmond of St.
i-ouis was among those who admired the
jewels, and at the same time he compli
mented Captain Seymour and the detec
tives sent out by him on the prompt re
covery of the property.
'me jewels were secured from various
pawnshops In this city by Detectives Har
per and Sullivan. They consist of one
Immense diamond cluster, containing
many valuable stones; one great pearl set
with small diamonds, one ornament
formed of a large diamond, with radiat
ing gold and enamel arms, and one pansy
with solid diamond center and amethyst
petals set around with diamonds.
These do not constitute all the Jewels.
There aro yet missing one gold ring set
with a large pearl and a large diamond.
The man who sold the diamonds real
ized but $240 on those recovered. The
pawnbrokers will lose this unless the
owners make It good out of gratitude
for the delivering up of the gems. The
man who pawned them answers perfectly
the description of the missing butler.
Georce Hill, who from all the circum
stances is almost certainly the thief, may
be on his way to Honolulu or China by
this time. He had spoken to some of the
other servants at the Crocker place about
going to Hawaii, and the steamer Rio de
Janeiro sailed for Honolulu and China
Saturday evening at 5 o'clock. Hill was
last seen here Saturday afternoon, when
he sold the Jewels. He left San Mateo
Friday on a bicycle. He was paid his
wages on that day, but did not say he
was going to quit. The robbery was dis
covered Sunday morning. The Jewelry be
longed to Mrs. Easton, mother of A. M.
Easton of 10 California street, and grand
mother and guardian of tho children of
Colonel Fred F. Crocker. They were in a
casket In one of the rooms of the hottse.
Sunday morning the casket was found to
be empty and the missing butler was at
once suspected.
and three small stickpins, bearing dia
mond clusters. The total value of the
jewelry missing is placed at between Â£KW0
and $10,000.

Â«r.WILLIAM L. OVERSTREET,
Berkeley, Cal., May 6, 1900.
Editor The Callâ Dear Sir: I have been
requested by a number of persons to
write this communication. I trust you
will find space for its publication.
If the judges who officiated at the an
nual debate between teams representing
the Leland Stanford Jr. University and
the University of j California, held at
Metropolitan Temple. San Francisco, last
evening, will kindly state through the
public prints in what manner their deci
sion was reached and on what it was based
they would greatly oblige many who do
not agree with them.' I have spoken with
a number of persons regarding the award
and I have yet to meet one, save a rank
Stanford adherent, who considers the
award just. I have even been told that
known Stanford adherents and sympa
thizers have admitted the injustice of the
decision.
After laying aside every prejudice I
have in favor of the University of Cali
fornia, and after a close study, of each
sneaker's argument. I am utterly â¢ un
able to find the least warrant for the
judge3* conclusion. I express the opinion
of a great many fair-minded auditors
when I say tho decision is utterly, with
out warrant or justice^ after taking Into
consideration the merits of the case as
presented and the methods of its present
ation. Very respectfully.
The Call does not hold Itfelf responsible for
the opinions published in th's column, but
presents them for whatever value they may
have as communications of general interest.
THE INTERCOLLEGIATE DEBATE
It is now fairly certain that in New York and the
Eastern States generally the Bryanites will make the
campaign by"ignoring the money question as far as
It is to be borne in mind that while at present both
branches of Congress are under control of the Repub
licans the margin of control is not so large but what
it may be lost should Bryan be elected to the Presi
dency. ' It has been recently pointed out by ex-
Comptroller Hepburn, treasurer of the Sound Money
League, that the terms of thirty Senators expire next
March, of whom eighteen are Republicans and twelve
are Democrats and Populists. Of the eighteen Re
publicans eleven represent Colorado, Delaware,
Idaho, Illinois. Iowa, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska
(two), Oregon, South Dakota, West Virginia ami
Wyoming, States which cannot be depended upon
with any certainty to re-elect Republicans, much less
sound money men. This fact was referred to as one
of the things that might compel the league to con
tinue its activities during this year.
The league is right. It is true that the financial
measures recently carried through Congress place
our finances on a firm basis and establish the gold
standard by positive declaration of law, but the dang-r
of a repeal of the law is by no means slight. So long
as Bryan is the candidate of a great party of the peo
ple, and so long as he stands as a champion of the
Chicago platform demanding the remonetization of
silver at the ratio of 16 to i, so long will there be
need of a careful watch upon financial issues.
BRY0N AND THE MONEY ISSUE.
1 \EPQRTS from New York are to the effect that
UV when ex-Secretary Morton retired from the
office of president of the Sound Money League
he urged the league to disband, giving as a reason
therefor that with the passage of the currency bill con
firming the gold standard the mission of the league
had been fulfilled and nothing remains for it to do.
The counsel was not followed. The league chose s
new president and continues its organization, the
members being of the opinion that the work which it
undertook has by no means been fully accomplished.
DESTRUCTION OF THE MAINEâ N.
F. P.. Newcastle, Cal. At the time of the
destruction of the United States battle
ship Maine it was dark. The City of
Washington was about 200 yards to the
southward and stern of the Maine, the
Alphonso XII was about 250 yards north
ward and westward and the German war
vessel Gulesenan was about 400 yards to
the northward of the Maine. There wer*.
other vessels distant 200 yards and upward
CENSUS ENUMERATORSâ J. F. B..
Castroville. Cal. The compensation of
census enumerators la fixed by the Direc
tor of the. Census at from 2 to 3 cents for
each inhabitant recorded, 15 to 20 cents for
ench farm and from 20 to 30 cents for each
establishment of productive industry. He
is empowerded to fix a pÂ«Â»r diem when the
collection Is difficult. No travel pay is
allowed unless fixed by the Director of
the Census. HHMSQesMjKraBI
TEETH-R. City. This department Is
willing to answer questions, but when a
question comes in the following shape it
is unable to do so: "Kindly answer the
following: My wife has a son born wÂ«th
two teeth and double crown, the teeth
arc in lower jaw and are central inclf
ors." The correspondent has evidently
omitted something.
CHICKENSâ J. A. P.. City. Diarrhoea
in chickens is usually brought about by
too much green or soft food. In such
cases the diet must be changed and water
be given .sparingly. A remedy for this
trouble is a composition of Jive grains of
powdered chalk, the same of rhubarb and
three grains of cayenne pepper.
NOT SPIRITUALISTS-G. H. B., City.
The several published lives of Abraham
Lincoln and of his wife make no mention
that either was ever a spiritualist. Lin
coln "favored and assisted aJl forms of
Christian religious organization and work
and thanked God for the churchesâ all the
churches."
TWO STRAITSâ Sub., Port Costa. The
narrow body of water that connects San
Francisco and San Pablo bays is called
the Strait of San Quentin. Raccoon
Straits are between the north shore of
Angel Island and the south shore of
Marin County, between Peninsula Point
and Point Bluff.
A LETTERâ E. W., City. A letter ad
dressed to a person, delivered to and re
ceived by that person, is the personal
property of the one so addressed. The
writer has no proprietary rights in it after
it has been delivered. For the receiver
to send back a letter to the writer upon
demand is a matter of choice.
SUBSTITUTE CLERKâ IX. San Jose.

CALIFORNIANS IN WASHINGTON
With that much by way of warning no thrifty
American will go abroad with a determination "to
see Paris and die." The motto should be "See Paris
and live." It will be a poor policy for our people to
go to the gay city for the purpose of providing hptel
keepers with a means of getting their hotels fumi
gated, refurnished and repapered at our expense. It
may, remain true as of old that "all good Americans
go to Paris when they die," but none who has a
proper regard for; the, -welfare' of his heirs will g O
there for the purpose of dying.'- . â¢
CZJOR many a year past the people of the world,
I and particularly those of the United States, have
been supplied with a continual stream of infor
mation concerning Paris. The social structure of the
people, their politics, their follies, their statesmen,
students, grisettes, actresses, ways, means, manners,
morals and immorals have all been described and illus
trated a hundred times over, and yet, since the expo
sition opens, it appears that all we have been told
heretofore is not half that should have been told.
Almost every day we learn something new, and,
moreover, some of the new things are of deep interest
and concern to all Americans who intend to visit
Paris during the exposition season.
One of the latest bits of information, valuable to
tourists, is furnished by a correspondent of the New
York Times, who, in commenting upon the state
ment that if a stranger die in Paris the landlord has a
claim therefrom for damages to his property, goes on
to say: "I not only heard this, but unexpectedly
found it to be true when I was in Paris. At the same
hotel with me was an American gentleman, accom
panied by his father, the latter being in feeble health.
One night the father suddenly died from a heart at
tack. There was nothing contagious or infectious
about the case. Nevertheless the officials, who came
in their uniforms, accompanied by secretaries, in
sisted on fumigation, for which a large sum. was de
manded and paid. Then came the undertakers, and
you should have seen their bill! It was nearly, a yard
long, with about a hundred items. Of course there is
so 'much red tape in France and so many Government
monopolies and. taxes that it greatly adds to the ex
pense. But then, to cap the climax, came the out
rageous and exorbitant demands of the landlord, who
insisted on being paid for new furniture, new carpet;
new wallpaper, as well as a solatium for his excite
ment and distress and the possible injury to his busi
ness, which was nil. The consequence was that my
friend had to pay over $iooo before- he was allowed
to leave the country with the corpse of his father."
A WARNING FROM PARIS.
Phelan's organ defends the makeshift policy of his
present term of office by complaining that the policy
of his former term was so wasteful no money was left
in the treasury for street lighting or sprinkling.
Thus, according to the organ, the blame rests not
upon the Mayor of to-day, but the Mayor of yester
day. To the public, however, there is no difference
between the two. It is Jimmy now and it was Jimmy
then, and the issue he started then is the one that is
up to him now.
The Sausalito poolrooms have reopened. This is
another reason why the streets of our city should be
lighted after midnight. It requires money to play,
the game at Sausalito.
The dress represented is for a youne
glrj. It Is of pastel blue cloth, embroid
ered all over with gauze to match. The
corsage is crossed by a scarf, which forms
a drapery over the skirt. The tunic Is of
cloth, braided, and the rest of the skirt Is
plain.
SPRING CLOTH DRESS.
It may well be that the world is about to receive
the Roggs fiber as an important addition to its in
dustrial resources.
If this hop fiber can be demonstrated of economic
value for twine, rope, fabric or paper, the hop in
dustry will at once gain an impetus that is at present
incalculable. California. Oregon and Washington are
Ereat hop producers. If ten dollars an acre could be
added to the value of the crop by u*e of the fiber.' the
industry* will advance to first importance. We might
then expect that the finest Bohemian hops, richer in
lupilinc than our ordinary article and commanding
always a gilt-edged price, would be generally intro
duced, and a double value be yielded by every hop
field in the West. The Agricultural Department at
Washington should at once take up Mr. Boggs' dis
covery of this new fiber and test it. It will be neces
sary to know if it need the chemical change in rot
ting, required by flax, and under what conditions its
best decortication may be secured.
Commerce and production have had to acknowl
edge the immense results of the economic use of cot
tonseed oil. It turned the seed, which had been a
nuisance at every gin, into a by-product of such value
es to affect the price of every acre of cotton land in
the South. It gave added importance to the declara
tion of a New England statesman, that if Massachu
setts had had the cotton plant it would have become
at once the richest commonwealth in the world.
We are inclined to think that Mr. Boggs may havs
made an important economic discover}'. Up to this
time the existence of fiber in the hop vine seems not
to have occurred to any one else.
While only chemical experiment can demonstrate
the difficulties in digestion to pulp of the hop vine
fiber, to the non-professional observation it presents
none of the problems that have been found in corn
stover.
P"rom the appearance of the sample sent to us it
would seem that the decortication is easy, presenting
none of the difficulties which have so far effectually
barred the introduction of ramie culture into this
country. The rapid consumption of forests in sup
plying paper has forced an exploration of other
sources for that material. Corn stover has been con
sidered, but so far chemistry has not succeeded in di
gesting the abundant silicate that is present in the
cornstalk. The stalk is rebellious to manipulation,
and so far no important results have been reached.
With this hop fiber it is different. The vine may
produce its crop of hops without injury to. its fiber,
which would add to the profit of hop-growing to the
amount of the value of this by-product.
The fabric trade is on the constant lookout for new
fiber material. Heretofore we have gone to sisal
grass, ivite, ramie and other plants which produce
j";ber alone as their sole economic use. Even in flax
that which is used for fiber cannot be used also to
produce seed.
â¢npHE CALL has received from Mr. J. R. Boggs
j of Janesvillc, Lasscn County, California, a hank
of fiber from the hop vine. It was decorticated
by hand, is light colored and very strong, presenting
much the appearance of fine flax liber. On account of
the length of the hop vine this fiber may be very
Jong, presenting distinct advantage in spinning a
thread. Its light color commends it for a paper
making material, since it would require but little
bleaching.

"The Divine Porte" is not the correct
title; it is "the Sublime Porte." That i3
the name given to the building in which
are the offices of the Grand Vizier and
other high functionaries of the Ottoman
empire, hence the Turkish Government it
self. A quay on which were mounted
several large pieces of artillery ran along
outside of the whole length of the sea
waJI. which as well as the wall of the city
in which the building Is situated was
pierced with a number of pates, but only
one was in general use. That was the
great gate of the Seraglio, the Bab-t-
Humayum. or imperial gate, that sublime
porte from which the Ottoman Govern
ment derives the name by which it is best
known.
ENGLISH ARMY AND NAVT-C. R..
HydesvHle, Cal. The enlistment in the
English armv is for twelve and then for
nine years. The daily pay of a private la
the Infantry is 1 shilling per day, 1.2 in
cavalry. 1.2>a In artillery and V/z in the
engineer corps. The seamen for the Eng
lish navy are recruited from the, appren
tice boys. There are various ratings in
the navy from Â£24 to Â£106 a year. Boys
receive from Â£3 to Â£1S.
Those on the nearest vessels could not ob
serve much more than the outlines of the
Maine. No dead fish were observed In the
bay after the explosion. It Is stated that
as dusk comes ore the fish In the harbor
of Havana leave for the open t-ea, to re
turn at daylight. The testimony taken
during the Investigation shows that there
was a shooting up of a jrreat mass of
flame and debris, but there is no account
of any perceptible upheaval of water
other than that produced by the lurch of
the vessel.
While the facts stated are doubtless correct enough,
it is unfair to hold the Salisbury Ministry solely re
sponsible for them. The time has gone by when
Great Britain could' dominate the Old World, and
dictate what should or should not be done in Asia and
Africa. At the present time her statesmen are com
pelled to make concessions in order to obtain favors.
It is certain that Germany obtained control of the rail
way route across Asia Minor by reason of an arrange
ment with Great Britain which assured the British
a free hand in South Africa. Salisbury yielded in one
place in order to win in another, and his course was
probably the best that could have been taken, since
by adopting it he brings Germany into the Levant
to assist in counterbalancing the rapidly augmenting
power of Russia. Still, the fact remains that British
influence in Turkey is a thing of the past, and British
merchants and manufacturers have lost a fidd which
once promised to be a rich market for their trade.
A correspondent of the London Chronicle, com
menting on the situation, points out that Russia has
obtained almost absolute control of a large part of
Asia Minor, France has increased her influence in
Syria, Germany has obtained the overland route for
a railway from a point on the Mediterranean across
Mesopotamia to the Persian Gulf, while Great Britain
has obtained nothing. British influence in Turkey,
once all powerful, appears to have fallen to zero, and
counts for little or nothing in the affairs of that part
of the world.
It is not the loss of political prestige, however, that
frets the correspondent so much as the loss of trade.
On that subject he says: "Looking at the question
from the commercial point of view, England has not
had the smallest share in the profits that have been
reaped by other countries. Germany has the netway
of Anatolian railways, and not a year has passed
without her obtaining large orders for Krupp guns
and Mauser rifles and other munitions of war. France
has obtained concessions for quays and warehouses
and for the Salonica-Dede Agatch and other railways,
and now the French Cassaba Railway Company has
secured 40 per cent of the profits of the Bagdad line.
Germany is beginning to establish a connection with
the Ottoman navy by undertaking to reconstruct the
cruiser Assari-Tewfik on the Kiel yards, and even
Itaty has been given the reconstruction of the Mes
sandieh at a price which leaves an enormous margin
of profit. Only England, which saved Turkey in 1878,
has got nothing, and the whole fault is with our Gov
ernment and its officials, who have* mismanaged our
political interests and will not lift a finger to help
commerce."
Y~) RITISH newspapers reflect so fully the popular
K\ fondness for growling and grumbling that
â much must be allowed for exaggeration in the
complaints they are now making against the Gov
ernment for not upholding British interests in various
parts of the world. Nevertheless some of the state
ments of the grumblers appear amply justified by
facts. One of these is the complaint that while en
gaged in waging an unjustifiable war for the over
throw of the Dutch republics in South Africa the
Ministry has sacrificed the interests of the empire in
other localities, and particularly in the Levant.

possible and devoting their speeches and their docu
ments to other issues. A good many people would
be deceived by such tactics'if the sound money men
were to play, into the hands of the Bryanites by dis
banding and announcing that the money issue is no
longer before the people. ' There will always be a
financial issue before the country so long as there :s
a powerful party seeking to degrade , the currency.
Bryan stands for the Chicago platform to-day as
much as he did four years ago. It is for that reason
solely that the Populists and the silver fanatics who
have swarmed into the Democratic camp to the ex
clusion of the conservatives support him and make
his rcnomination a foregone conclusion. The money
question will be with us, in fact, so long as Bryan
ism is a power in politics.
These things instruct the people. They are not par
tisan material for any politicians. They are informa
tion acquired in the dear school of experience. They
stand against the theory that this territory i^ in the
Union and that its people are citizens of the United
States, to be of us and with us forever, whether we
will or they will, or not.
To illustrate: It has been frequently declared offi
cially and privately that Panay was a paradise in its
friendly peacefulness. Promising experiments in self
government have been inaugurated there, and we have
heard much about the reopened schools and recru
descent industries. Yet the severest reverse of the
whole war has just happened to us in the'happy isle
of Panay. Along with these reports come rumors
of two hundred of our officers, in the various com
mands in that service who have their resignations in
the hands of General Otis, anxious to escape the
noisome climate, the vertical sun and the poison air
and water, and get back home.
There is no evidence that any but the smallest frac
tion among them are our reliable friends. Let us dis
miss the fairy tale that we can depend upon them ?t
all as allies. To expect it is against nature. They are
cemented in a common interest against us. If they
profess friendship it is only that they may use the in
tercourse thereby secured for the advantage of their
own people.
We have 210 military posts and garrisons in the
island of Luzon alone, and yet the natives attack,
slay and retreat, to attack again, regardless of their
own losses.
The people of the United States make policies and
unmake them. The people have on hand this prob
lem, lying at a great distance from them. They must
face the truth as revealed by daily experience. Too
much cannot be said in praise of the President's de
sire to get at all the facts. He has at no time been in
tolerant or disposed to pursue a personal policy. His
recent appointment of Judge Taft, a pronounced and
vigorous anti-expansionist, to the chairmanship of
the new Philippine Commission, is evidence of his
purpose to give the issue ripe examination and to pre
vent that examination from being ex parte. The
problem is the country's problem and belongs no
more to the President than to the people. He takes
and stands by the position that these islands are not
yet under the constitution. They are not yet an in
tegral part of the Union of the United States. Our
military commanders on the ground are as much at
sea on the question as are the people at home. One
tiling stands out in bold relief. The Filipinos are not
conquered. Their spirit is not broken. Their
capacity for resistance has not begun to be exhausted.
Whether as guerrilla fighters or in regular formation
the}' make up in swiftness of movement, stealth of ap
proach and sudden disappearance in retreat what they
lack in tactics and discipline.
Mr. Wildman, late Vice Consul at Hongkong, says
that all the money paid for hemp at the recently
opened ports is being used by the Filipinos in buying
arms and ammunition, which they find no difficulty
in getting into the islands. Our friend the Sultan of
Sulu is on his way to Singapore to protest against
the tariff on imports into his domain, which has in
creased the cost of the necessaries of life.
May 3 there was a desperate fight at Leambanao,
in the center of the island of Panay. The Twenty
sixth Infantry was surrounded, four killed, and six
teen severely wounded were left on the field, and the
survivors retreated, having a very narrow escape.
May 2 General Otis said in an interview just before
leaving Manila for home: "You know I am rather
pessimistic. I am not inclined to take the sanguine
view prevailing in certain quarters, yet I have held
the opinion for a time that the thing is entirely over.
1 cannot see where it is possible for the guerrillas to
effect any reorganization, concentrate any force or
accomplish anything serious. We have 116 military
posts north of Manila and 94 south of the city."
On May i came the news of the siege of the Forty
third Volunteers at Catubig, in which nineteen
Americans were killed and two wounded. The sur
vivors were in great straits when a relief party ap
peared and raised the siege.
THE attempt to subdue the Filipinos goes on, un
abated, with great carnage and no end in sight.
Time and again General Otis has sent assur
ances that it was all over, and time and again it has
flamed up, not with the fitful flash of dying embers,
but the lurid light of a fresh conflagration..

Of commanding preeminence among all
those names are those of the six great
poet minds whom a kind Providence
equipped with transcendent creative ge
nius and, lavished within so short a time
upon the German people. Most naturally
do these six writers arrange themselves
in three complementary pairsâ Klopstock
The details of the slow and unimpres
sive foundation-laying that lasted for
more than a century we must here leave
unconsldered. passing at once to the mid
dle of the eighteenth century, when there
appeared the immediate beginnings of
modern German literature. Goethe has
Â¦written: "The first real living content,
true and high, came into German litera
ture through I Frederick the Great and the
deeds of tne seven years' war." That is
to say, as -the causes and results of the
thirty years' war had drained and dead
ened national life and literature, so now
the causes and results cf the seven years'
war (1736-63) brought vital energy in
aboundiner measure to both, and the out
come in the latter was the golden age of
German literature.
The characteristic writers of the age
mav be conveniently divided into three
main .groups, which follow one another
at Intervals of about twenty, years. To
the first group belong Klopstock, Wie
land. Leasing, WInekelmnnn, Kant,
Moses Mendelssohn. "With the exception
of -Kant their Influence was exerted by
works published between the years 17aO
and 1770. In the second group are Herder,
Goethe. Schiller. Voss, Kllntrer. Burger,
most of whose work in creating and guld-
Infr was done between 1770 and 1800. The
notable members of the third group,
whose principal writings determined the
romanticism of tho first quarter of the
nineteenth century, are the brothers
Schlegel and Tieck. the brothers Hum
boldt. Jflebuhr and Savigny. Of all the
important later writings' up to the middle
of the nineteenth century it may be said
that essentially they used only the great
Ideas, theories and art principles of the
above described groups.
The work of repression and dissolution
begun by the religious and political reac
tion of the second half of the sixteenth
century was completed with disastrous
thoroughness by the thirty years' war.
which destroyed nearly all the national
forces of Germanyâ material, social, in
tellectual, moral. It may here suffice to
state that not until about the year 1S30
did Germany again possess the actual,
absolute amount of capital and of mate
rial prosperity which existed before 161S.
and that the spiritual impoverishment of
the second half of the seventeenth cen
tury was scarcely Ies3 in degree than the
material exhaustion thus proved. German
literature of the early sixteenth century
had been essentially national, popular, or
iginal. A little more than a century later
the thread of historical continuity had
been severed, the widest possible gulf
opened between the people and what there
then was of literature, and this itself had
come to be servilely imitative of foreign
models.
In short, while the material and* spir
itual growth of England and France had
been and continued to be steadily pro
gressive. It was as If Germany right after
IMS had to recreate both nationality and
literature. This was indeed a stupendous
tusk, the accomplishment of which is not
the least interesting part of modern his
tory.
That the great classical period of mod
ern German letters came so late has Its
sufficient explanation In the thirty years'
war â 1618-1S48. Thi3 set Germany back
fully 200 years in comparison with France
and England. The Germany of the six
teenth century was in material prosperity
and social refinement probably superior
to the England nnd the France of that
age, and the nation was essentially one in
its intellectual culture.
If our rapid introductory survey has so
far seemed philosophic, abstract, it has at
least this justification, that during all the
period we are now approaching philosophy
flourished in Germany no less than poetry,
and both were there and then interre
lated and reciprocally influential to a de
gree unknown at any other time or In any
other land.
The turn of Germany to lead and to con
tribute came at last. The golden age of
its primacy extends In Its broader limits
from the year 1748 to about 1S50. or more
narrowly from about 1760 to 1S25. The
golden gift of German literature, philos
ophy and science during this period to the
modern world is the idea of organism.
Synthesis, the individual, spontaneity, de
velopment, comparison â these are the
terms wherein the Germans have led us
to think â organism not mechanism.
matism, this enforcement of tradition and
authority yielding to English empiricism,
and the latter breaking down its practical
limits and merging- Into French rational
ism.
â¢ The report of Grand Secretary George
T. Shaw shows that at the close of the
year the membership in this State was
30,772. The accession during the year was
2284 and the withdrawals from various
causes 1885, leaving a net gain of 399. The
disbursements during the year amounted
to $4S5,008. of which $269,017 was paid for
charity and relief. The average per mem
ber for relief was $S 74 and average dis
bursements per member for current ex
penses was $7 01. The receipts were $317,-
CS2 23, being an excess of $02,678 33 over dis
bursements. The assets of the order
amount to $2,478,904 45.
The reports of the grand trustees and
grand representatives were read and
adopted.
The whole of the afternoon session was
taken up in the discussion of the report
of the Grand Lodge committee on ap
peals. There are twenty-one of these, and
the judgment of the committee was SU3Â»
talned in every case. The appeals of Dun
bar vs. Concordia Lodge, Dunlap vs Sun
set Rebekah Lodge, Cunning vs. Mound
Lodge, Holbrook vs. San Lorenzo Lodge
and Mitchell vs. Bloomflcld Lodge were
reversed. In the appeals of Petersen vs
California Lodge, Trout vs. San Lorenzo
Lodge and Walton vs. Capay I,odge the
judgment of each lodge was affirmed. In
one case against California Lodgeâ action
on sick benefitsâ the lodge was directed
to investigate the claim, and the appeal
of Gumbiner vs. Crockett Lodge was dis
missed. The committee on appeals con

The grand officers will be elected to
morrow.
At the afternoon session the report of
the grand master, so far a* it relates to
the Odd Fellows' Home, was made the
ppoclal order for 10 o"clock this morning,
when It will be discussed and it is thought
that the discussion will be an exciting
one.
The Question has been asked: How can a
change ba made without imposing too great
a burden on the lodge*? The answer is ob
vious; if this Grand Lodge should decide to
change thql location, let It delegate to some
committee authority to receive proposals for a
site and report thereon at Its next session.
I am firmly of the belief that a new location
for this institution should be soueht imme
diately. If we have no consideration for the
sufferings of those poor old people from chills
and shaking and feverâ from excessive heat
In summerâ from cold rooms In winterâ if we
are regardless of the miseries of an isolation
such as they have to endure. If we care
naught for the extra expense â then. Therma
lito is as good aa any other location, but If we
do care for theso things and I believe the Odd
Fellows of California have only to fully real
ize the situation In order to furnish the rem
edyâthen let us move the home and let us do
It now.
Durinc my official term I have instituted in
person three subordinate lodge?, dedicated two
nails, wrote 1<H3 letters, visited 101 subordi
nate lexises, seven Robekah lodges and the
home at Thermalito; have traveled 16,227 mliea
p.s follows: By rail 10,609 miles, by water
749 miles, and by team 869 miles; have held
two sDeclal sessions of the Grand Lodge.
Relative to the Odd Fellows' Home at
Thermalito. he says, after giving a
lengthy account of his observations on a
visit to the place:
The time of the session until recess was
taken up with the reading of the report
of Grand Master "W. A, Bonynge. In this
he calls attention to the fact that four
new subordinate lodges were instituted as
follows: Westminster No. 72, at "West
minster, Orange County; Colonia No. 8?,
at Oxnard, Ventura County; Commercial
No. 387, at IxÂ»s Angeles, and Boulder
Creek No. 152. at Boulder Creek, Santa
Cruz County. Also sixteen Rebekah lodges
during the year. A great deal of the re
port refers to his official acts, which ho
sums up as follows:
The committee on credentials presented
its report, after which the Grand Lodge
degree was conferred on 250 past grand3
and the working committees for the ses
sion ! were appointed.
The several hundred representatives, to
gether with the sitting grand officers and
the past grands who compose the Grand
Lodge of Odd Fellows of California, as

bodies of representative men that has
ever assembled in the name of Odd Fel

ODD FELLOWS IN
THE GRAND LODGE
terday morning in the Memorial Hall of
the Odd Fellows' building. All the officers
were' present, as were also several of the
past presidents and the delegates, whose
names have already been published in
The Cull.
After the presentation of the report of
the committee on credentials and the
conferring of the assembly degree on
about 200 past noble grands there was an
eloquent and encouraging address by Past
Grand Master Barnes, after which a re
cess was taken until 3 o'clock in the after
noon.
At the afternoon session there was a
congratulatory address to the delegates by
Past Grand Master J. H. Glasson, after
which the report of the president, Mrs.
Helen M. Carpenter, was read. This
shows that during the year she visited 127
lodges and held one special session of the
Assembly. It also shows that the total
number of members is 17.172; net gain
during the year, 700; new lodges insti
tuted, 16: lodges surrendered charters, 2;
total number of lodges, 237. On the sub
ject of interest in the order by the mem
bers Mrs. Carpenter says:
It Is very pleasing to note the increasing
favor of white robes and white dresses. The
staffs of more than one-half of the lodges
visited were thus attired. Some tried it as an
Â¦exi>erlment and the fact that the lodge, robes
were utilized In making comforters for the or
phans is conclusive evidence of their choice.
White is destined to supplant the vari-colored
robes manufactured for the market, as it
possesses the double advantage of beauty and
economy. And, again, what could be more
fitting than the color which represents the base
of all the grand principles of Odd Fellowship?
In relation to the Orphans' Home at
Gilroy, which is under special care of the
Rebekahs, she says:
The Orphans* Home is the pride of the Re
bekahs, and the lodges generally are deeply
interested In the work and are contributing
most generously to the support of that Insti
tution. A few lodges that have suffered finan
cial straits deplored their inability to gratify
their generous Inclinations; but such as these
needed merely to be apprised of the ways and
means that are within the easy reach of the
least prosperous, to give their hearty assist
ance. The sisters of Santa Monica furnish a
worthy example in devoting one afternoon In
each week to Orphans' Home work. Others
hp.ve donated beyond our greatest expectations,
and there seems to be an augmented interest
proportionate to the increasing family and Its
responsibilities. . The able management of the
home by the board of trustees, down to the
minutest details, Is worthy the noble women
who are giving their time and best thought
unstlntlngly to the cause, wishing no greater
reward than the consciousness of duty well
performed.
The report shows that during her term
the president did a great deal of official
work.
The reports of the other officers were
received and referred to appropriate com
mittees.
The Assembly is to be presented a set of
gavels at to-day's session.
The election of the officers for the en
suing term will be held on Thursday
next.
In the evening there was present in the
Assembly Hall of the Odd Fellows' build
ing a large number of officers and dele
gates, before whom the ritualistic work
was performed by a team from Templar
Lodge. The work memorized, floor and
dramatic, was with that degree of per
fection for which this lodge's team is
noted. A great deal of praise was given
to Noble Grand Mrs. Dale Warford and
her corps of efficient officers, who have
been drilled to their present degree of
perfection by Past Noble Grand R. c.
Black, who a few evenings ago, as a
recognition of his services, was present
ed by the lodge with a beautiful gold
watch appropriately inscribed.
After the work there was an informal
reception to the officers and delegates to
the Assembly and a short programme of
dancing.

REBEKAHS MEET IN
STATE ASSEMBLY
At the first session of the Subsidiary
High Court of the Ancient Order of For
esters in Foresters' building yesterday
there were present 130 delegates, eight
members of the executive council and four
past high chief rangers. The session was
called to order by Subsidiary High Chief
Ranger M. Boehm. The chair, alter hav- |
ing received the report of the committee j
on credentials?, appointed committees on
laws and supervision, state of the order,
grievances and appeals, finance and ac
counts, written and unwritten work, mile
age and per diem, on distribution, on ;
time and place of meeting, after which i
the report of the subsidiary, high chief i
ranger was presented.
The report shows that there was a net
gain of 200, despite the fact that sixteen
courts had gone out of existence. The
January report of 1898 gives the number of
courts as 150, membership 74S5. Report of
March, 1900, shows number of courts 135,
membership 7GS7. Funds of the subordi
nate courts January 1, 1S93, $71,087 63;
March 31, 1900, $S5.682 74â an increase of
514.597 11 since January 1. 1S98.
â¢Our jurisdiction covers a large terri
tory." said Mr. Boehm, "ajid our members
in the North and East complain of the dis
advantages they are under, the order not
being properly taken care of in that sec
tion by the Subsidiary High Court, that
the entire attention is given to one portion
only, namely, California, and for this rea
son have become disheartened. I would
recommend that some provision be made
at this session bv which the entire juris
diction be strengthened and our order be
come better known on the Pacific Coast.
A number of proposed amendments tn
the general laws were taken up ajid acted
upon, one oÂ£ these, having, for its purpose
abolishing the office of permanent secre
tary and creating the office of general sec
retary to be elected in the same manner
as the other officers, was defeated by a
vote of 111 noes to 16 ayes.
At the afternoon session the discussion
of the proposed amendments was con
tinued. The most important of these was
a proposition to strike out from the con
stitution that section which declares that
"no department of this order shall be al
lowed to transact any business on Sun
day; nor shall any picnic, excursion or
entertainment of any character be given
on that day in the name of the Ancient
Order of Foresters. This section shall
not be construed to prevent the attend
ance of a court at the funeral of a mem
ber." That and five other amendments
were defeated.
To-day the legislative body will be called
upon to pass on a proposition to create a
general relief fund to be raised by a tax
of 5 cents a member Quarterly and to be
used to assist courts or members in dis
tress. To transfer the majiajrernent of the
official organ to the order: to reduce the
per capita tax to 75 cents; the report of

Christoph Martin Wieland was born
near Biberach, in Wurtemberg, in 1733.
and died in 1513 at Weimar, whither he
was called by Duchess Amalia in 1772 as
tutor of her sons. His youthful writings*
Influenced by Klopstock and Plato, were
followed by a period of revulsion from
their pietlstic strain to delight in the worltl
and the pleasures of sense. Finding the
golden mean, he was at the height of hi*
power during the first decade of his resi
dence in Weimar. His notable novels are
Frledrich Gottlieb Klopstock was born
in 1724 at Quedlinburg. He studied the
ologyâ1715 to 1748â at the universities of
Leipzig and Jena, In 1751 the art-loving
King. Frederick V of Denmark, called
him to Copenhagen, and there Klopstcck
remained twenty years. After thf death
of his patron he lived almost continuously
in or near Haihburg. where in 1VC he
died, honored as the patriarch of modern
German literature. His fame rests upon
hia many lyric poems and mainly upon
his masterpiece, "The Messiah." nomi
nally a religious epic In twenty cantos,
singing Christ's death, resurrection and
ascension, the chief beauties of which,
however, are also lyrics in their nature.
Indeed, as regards the form and style of
his great work Klopstock ought never to
have been called the German Milton; he
is rather a literary Bach or Handel, and
his work a literary oratorio in Its pro
fuse blending of lyric arias and dramatic
choruses with epic recitative.

and Wieland. Lesslng and Herder. Goethe
and Schiller. After rather summary
treatment of the first two pairs we shall
attempt a pregnant characterization of
him whom so many look upon as the
greatest man of modern times, and re
serve for a following brief article a dis
cussion of his companion, the first dra
matist of Germany.
Thus, then, in letters and thought we
see In successive sway over Europe Ital
ian humanism giving way to Spanish dog-
During and immediately after the
breaking up of the Ideal unity of medi
eval life and thought Italy led the way
by her rediscovery and use of the treasure
of Greek art and literature; Spain fol
lowed, imposing: herself upon and dom
inating literary Europe no less than re
ligious and political Europe. Though now
the reformation arose in Germany, it was
England that shattered the rule of Spain
and became the leader of European
thought and letters. Bacon and Shake
speare taught men in defiance of all tra
dition and authority to observe and record
as they are the facts of nature, physical
or moral. Next, under the leadership of
France, Europe went on to complete the
work which the English had begun, of
making human reason supreme in reli
gion, politics, art.
Of the literatures of Europe the German
was the last to have its Rolden age. The
four other great European nations suc
ceeded one the other, but all preceded
Germany in making their finest contribu
tions to modern culture. A vivid sketch
of this general movement made some
years a so by a notable German essayist,
Karl Hillebrand, may be condensed in out
line as follows:

CHICAGO, May 8.â Most of the day wheat
was a bit advanced over yesterday's closing
figures. Th-; opening was firm because there
was more steadiness In cables than had been
expected and because there was heavy rain
In the Southwest, where it is not wanted and
none in the extreme Northwest, where It is
reported to be needed. There was a period of
df-pre^hlon following the opening, the corn
weukneB!- being the principal motive, but later
the market rallied. The rally was helped by
liradstrcei's decrease In the world's visible and
by a lair cash demand. July left on" with an
improvement of
The corn market was dull and heavy. The
opening showed a fractional decline and Im
mediately after the market rallied some on a
little spurt In the demand, but this was opeed
ily overcome by pressure of long stuff and
the market sagged. There was also short sell-
Ing and considerable amounts came out on
stop-loss orders. The cash demand was slow
and there seemed to be little support' coming
from the bull crowd. The close was heavy,
with a loss of V4c for July.
Oats were weak In sympathy with corn and
trade was rather dull. July closed U@}Â»c
lower.
Provisions were weak most â¢ of the session,
but toward the end steadied on buying by an
Influential packer. July pork closed 15c lower,
lard 2Vic down and ribs a shade lower.

NEW YORK. May 8.â There were no new
features In the metal market to-day. Cables
were again a little lower. Tin here was
slightly off from yesterday's closing prices
owing to lack of demand and large receipts
The close was easy at $29 25(g29 50. Pig iron
v.-nrriints were very weak in the absence of
buyers, closing nominally at $15 50; Northern
No. 1 foundry was quoted at 21@23c â entirely
nominal at that. Spelter also ruled u little
easier, closing barely steady at $4 D7H bid nnd
$4 C2'/i asked. Lake copper and lead were dull
nnd unchanged, closing at $17 and $4 40g4 43
respectively. The brokers' price for lead was
14 20 and for copper $17.
Nezv York Metal Market.
While not particularly active to-day the
market for evaporated apples maintained Its
firm undertone. Receipts were light and coun
try advices favorable. Sellers were conspicu
ous by their abs;nce. At the close prices were
unchanged, but showed an upward tendency.
California dried fruits were dull and nominally
unohanj-ed.

CLOSING
NEW YORK. May 8.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
There was universal weakness in the markets
to-day on forced liquidation, chiefly in West
Australians. Trouble was reported in the
Glasgow market and funds were weak on ex
pectation of an early loan by the London
County Council on favorable terms. Americans
were a big feature throughout. They opened
nervous under parity and New York prices
dropped until the afternoon, when they became
very soft here on New York offerings. The
fall was accelerated in the I street. Talk of
American gold shipments to begin this week
was persistent. Tintos and Anacondas were
flat, fearing that metal troubles in America
will spread to copper. Money was in moderate
demand. Bills were steady. The Bank of
England did a trifling business in discounts
and the market Indebtedness has not been com
pletely repaid. Indian buying of silver offsets
flight American spiling.

ROBERT BRUNS.
ALAMEDA, May 8.â A two-year-old
baby who can render in perfect -tone
and without the loss of a note Gaul's
magnificent "Holy City'' is the latest in
the infant musical prodigy line in Ala
meda. The youngster Is Robert Bruns,
son of Mr. and Mrs. J. H. Bruns, residing
at 1617 Hibard street. The little phenom
enon has a wonderful ear for music and
an almost unaccountable talent for har
monious rendition of selections which the
trained voice handles with utmo?t care.
The parents have no desire to pose their
offspring and have bent every effort to
prevent the abnormal development of the
child. He has repeatedly caught words
and airs of difficult compositions after
once hearing them, and he Is as much at
home with the minor classics in music as
he Is with ragtime.
Tlje boy's marvelous gifts were made
apparent as soon as he could lisp. Since
he was 19 months old the little prodigy
has exhibited his peculiar talent. The
family constantly resist the entreaties of
their friends to exhibit the boy, because
it is feared that the delicate nervous or
ganization might be injured. At home he
displays his musical bent with such evi
dent ease and naturalness that the pa
rents do not repress the boy. Those who
have been privileged to hear him are mys
tified over his remarkable power.

students of the institute. The plans were
drawn by Student R. R. Taylor. The en
lire furnishing will be done by students,
vrtio w*lf"mafcÂ«? chairs, tables, decks and
other fixtures.
Hooker T. Washington has Just tent to

Etndenta at work on the structure. It

Shanklm Acquitted.
r'KEEXO, May 8.â J. W. Shanklln. the
cx-C!ty Clerk, who was on trial for em
bezzlement of public money, was acquit
ted to-night by the Jury acting on the in
structions of Judge Carroll Cook of San
Francisco, who presided at the trial. The
Judge held that the prosecution had failed
to show that the money alleged to have
been embezzled waa city money, and also
failed to chow that a proper demand had
been made. There are several charges
landing, but the probability of a comple
tion is now very slim.
cjpP COMPLIMENTARY testimonial con
// A cert to the brilliant young violln
ll 1st. Sada, was tendered this after
noon at the California Theater by
Mayor Phelan and a number of other
prominent patrons and patronesses. The
audience was by no means so large as
should have been attracted by the pro
gramme presented by this gifted young ar
tist, but was most discerningly enthusi
astic.
One is reminded anew in hearing this
14-year-old child of the old saying that
every Hungarian is born with a violin in
his fingers, for though Toledo. Ohio,
claims Miss Wertheim as a citizen, it is
certainly to her Hungarian ancestry that
she owes her power of Interpretation of
such music as the "Zlgeunerweisen" and
Lalo's "Symphonio Espagnole," more;
Hungarian than Spanish as it is. and here
given probably for the first time yester
day.
The programme was in every way dis
tinguished and satisfactory. Sada's first
number, the "Zlpeunerweisen," was greet
ed with prolonged applause, to which she
responded with the Chopin Ndcturne In E
flat. The Lalo symphony, yet new to a
San Francisco audience, also roused much
enthusiasm, and*the familiar Salnt-Saens
"Rondo Caprlccioso" was played with the
utmost verve and astonishing ease. Miss
Wertheim returns to her study in Brus
sels almost immediately, and it Is safe to
prophesy a brilliant future for this youth
ful genius.
Sada was assisted by Miss Maude Fay,
soprano, a San Francisco girl, who to a
most charming personality adds a rich,
full voice, comparatively untrained as yet,
but with much promise. The violinist and
vocalist were capably and sympatheti
cally accompanied by Mies Ida Clement.

ment of Mrs. Rose Albers as attendant in
waiting at Dr. Conn's dental establish
ment on Washington street. Mrs. Albern
Is young, not unattractive, a widow, and
withal possessed of some relics of pros
perity in the shape of a diamond ring and
a shirt stud that also contained a flash
ing gem from the Transvaal.
Mrs. Albers explains that feeding em
ployment she accepted the dental gen
tleman's flattering offer, and was duly in
stalled, gems and all, as the outside guar
dian of the tooth extractor's emporium.
Cupid managed to do some deadly .work,
runs the story of the incarcerated doc
tor. His fair employe must havg become
smitten, for. says Dr. Conn in explanation
of his plight:
"The poor girl fell in love with me,
but really, you see, I could not help that,
bo T couldn't refuse .when Rosle wished
her diamond ring on my finger.
"The ring is gone. Yes, you under
stand, I was washing my hands and the
stone dropped out of the setting and was
lost in the laboratory washbasin drain.
Rosie was standing near me when the
awkward accident occurred.
"I showed her the ring and told her I
would surely replace It. I promised her
father also I would fix the matter all
right, but Instead of glvinp me a chance
to do that I am lugged off to jail."
Mrs. Albers declares that matters are
very different. She admits she foolishly
gave the rins; to Conn to wear, at his re
quest, and likewise had she parted under
the same conditions with her diamond
stud.
"I. found they had been pawned, and
that's why I had him arrested." asserted
the aersrievpd young- woman. Mrs. Albers
Is a daughter of Louis Homeier. a well
known musician. Conn was arraigned to
day in the Police Court, but remains in
jail in default -of $2000 bail.

SERIOUS ALLEGATION
AGAINST A BROTHER
A meeting of the trustees of the Free
Public Library was held last night
at the City Hall. Trustees Wise,
O'Connor, Boyd, Taylor, Bishop, and
Mayor Phelan were present. The
board decided to make application to
the Supervisors for an additional $5000 In
the tax levy. With this sum, the trus
tees say, they could provide the proposed
reference and reading room at the park
lodge with" books and shelving and meet
the expense of the place for a year.
The following trustees were appointed a
committee to consider the matter and
take necessary steps to secure the erec
tion of a central public library building:
Joseph O'Connor,- P. N. Lillenthal. Ralph
C. Harrison, James D. Phelan and John
H. Wise.
Mrs. Dr. Merrltt offered the trustees
the Sutro Library, conditionally. Action
on the matter was postponed until further
consultation could be had with the donor.
WANTS LIBRARY TO
HAVE ITS OWN HOME
iikR ARK THAU, of the Alcazar has
f/W\ tried an experiment on the
II IK VÂ» theater-going public that ap
â¢* pears to be a success. He Is giv
ing them an old-fashioned, lurid melo
drama, entitled "The Diamond Robbery,"
in which there are all the elements of the
melodrama. That the versatility of the
Alcazar company is on a par with Im
ported organizations Is proved by the fact
that they have successively and success
fully played -"Quo Vadis," "Sue," and the
present production, which calls for an en
tirely different class of action.
"The Diamond Robbery" meets in all
respects the demands for a play of this
kind. Its climajtes, intense situations,
strong characters and highly colored
story fascinate the average auditor who
visits the theater In order to be enter
tained.
The players do themselves credit In this
production, and Marie Howe in particular
is deserving . of praise by. reason of the
realism and unnerving energy with which
she invests her role. Her Hebrew dialect
is decidedly commendable and her entire
conception of the part thoroughly com
petent. ""George Webster In the role of the
detective gives once more ample proof of
the talent he possesses. Georgie Wood
throp in the part of the Irishwoman pre
sents a character part of great merit and
has the laughers on her side throughout
the evening. In comedy work of this kind
she is talented.
May Blayney, who has established her
self safely as a juvenile of superior
achievement, gives full satisfaction once
more. Irene Everett looks strikingly
handsome in the role of the vlllalness and
invests the part with necessary force.
Ernest Hastings gives a most interesting
idea of the Senator. He is not as coarse
as others Who appeared in the role, and
this toning down speaks well . for Mr.
Hastings* Judgment and discrimination.
Edwin Emery in the juvenile role ha3 the
girls on his side, and his love scenes count
among the features of the play. Ernest
Howell shows remarkable versatility In
his double role of the grandfather and the
typical bowery man.
Judging from the strong character of
this play arid the exemplary production
idven it it will run to packed nouses the
balance of the week especially as the
taste for melodrama has been very pro
nounced in this city.

An East Oakland Merchant
Drops Out of Sight Pear
ing Detectives.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
* 1118 Broadway, May 8.
Believing that he was being pursued by
Southern Pacific detectives, G. D. White,
recently a fruit dealer at 655 East Twelfth
street, has' disappeared under circum
stances which lead his friends to fear that
he 1b temporarily demented.
White dropped out of sight about two
weeks ago, out the first intimation con
cerning his condition of mind was in the
receipt of several letters sent by the de
parted business man to friends in this
city. H. H. Colby, Wells. Fargo & Co.' s.
agent at Thirteenth avenue and Bast
Twelfth street, was White's landlord. To
him the absentee wrote as follows:
"The freight agent accuses me of go
ing into the freighthouse, breaking open
that crate and taking out some of those
covers. Such a fool thing for me to do Is
not worth considering. I did not do It.
I could not, even if I thought of such a
thing. Those covers have been taken out
by some oth#r hands; not by mine. Do
you think for a moment I am fool enough
to pet the key from the agent, go inti*
the freifrhthouse, break open one of those
crates and take out those covers? It Is
out of the question for any man to do a
thing so plain as that. Well, good-by, Mr.
Colby. Yours truly."
Though unsigned the letter was In
White's handwriting, and inclosed was the
key to the store he had occupied. White
also requested Colby to sell out what
stock remained there.
The letter referred to a complaint that
the Southern Pacific freight shed at
Brooklyn had been broken open and that
White was suspected. In other letters the
missing man writes that he Intended to go
away on some ship. He promises William
King, an East Oakland barber, to return
and repay borrowed money. To Mrs.
Briggs, King's sister, White says he will
soon be at the Cliff House, the supposi
tion being that he meant suicide. White's
business venture was unsuccessful and he
was despondent over his 111 fortune. He
was formerly a Southern Pacific Com
pany brakeman.

"While using Mocha and Java coffee
I was finally thrown into a serious case
of nervous prostration, with heart trou-

also had most serious stomach trouble
for 3'ears. We finally gave up coffee
and began the use of Postum. Both
husband and myself have now been per-
fectly well for three years.
"Mrs. C. R. Holmes of 1946 Adair

Twenty-fevcnth .street, Los Angeles,
both tried Postum Food Coffee but did
not boil it fifteen minutes, according to
directions, and therefore did not like it.
I made a cup for each of them the rieht
\vay an-1 now they use it daily and like
it very much.
"Mrs. Ida Sherman of 6113 Went-
worth avenue. Chicago, had been quite
ill for years with dyspepsia and ner-
vousness and I urged her to leave off
coffee and take Postum Food Coffee.
She now writes me that she is entirely
cured.
"Mrs. Julia Moore of Riverside. Cal..
and also Mrs. Lily Staldn of Riverside,
nerc both ill for some years with heart

Moore was cured and in three months
after making the change Mrs. Staldn

SAX JOSE. May 8.â A sensation was
sprung to-day by Student Miller in the
investigation at the Normal School of the
charges against Mrs. Place. Miller de
clared that Attorney F. C. Jacobs had
made a proposition to get him his di
ploma for $500. This sum was afterward
reduced to $300, and Miller said that Ja
cobs had told Mrs. Rockwell, a client of
the attorney, he had seen two members
of the board in regard to the matter. He
added further that Jacobs had told him
that If he would put the money in the
bank Jacobs would make an Iron-clad
contract !n regard to the getting of the
diploma, and if the attempt to- purchase
It failed it "would not cost Miller a cent.
In concluding hia statement. Miller said
Ed Rea, son of ex->5oss Rca, had told
him that the Southern Pacific and Dan
Burns had been Instrumental In select
ing teachers for the Normal School, and
that the Republican Good Government
League kept Mrs. Place In her . position.
"I concluded." said Miller, "if the South
ern Pacific had anything to do with the
Trustees It was a boodle board and could
be bought"
The tirst witness this morning In the
case against Mrs. Place was Sidney Me-
Graw, a pupil in the training department.
He testified there was disorder In the
dames taught by Miller. John Phelps
gave similar testimony. Miller then In
troduced the testimony of several pupils
of the training school to prove his teach
ins abilities. Rev. J. E. Squires, pastor
of the South Methodist Church, testified
that in his opinion Miller would make a
good teacher.
Principal McNaughton did not think
Miller would make a good teacher. He
lacked certain qualifications. Professor
Schoof eald Miller might make a" success
as a country schoolteacher, but would be

RULE FOR EXAMINATION
OF TEACHERS ADOPTED
San Francisco and San Mateo Com
pany Will Soon Have a Through
Line in Operation.
The San Francisco and San Mateo
Electric Railway was yesterday granted
n franchise to operate its line through
the streets of San Mateo. This means an
early construction of a through road from
this city into the heart of San Mateo. The
directors of the road have acquired a
right of way through private property for
a distance of eight miles from its present
terminus, and when the system is com
pleted it will be exactly twenty miles in
length. It will parallel the Southern Pa
cific road and no doubt will be a brisk
competitor for traffic between the two
terminals mentioned.
The fact that eight miles of the road
will be through private grounds insures
an increased speed and a consequent
quick trip.

Special Officer Murphy was dismissed
from his position because he could not re

The charges filed against Sergeant Tom
Mahoney and Corporal "Bob" Cockrell
by.S. A. Hussey were dismissed. Hussey
stated that' both officers had visited thÂ«
racetrack while on duty.
Cornelius Rial and Ppeclal ORIcer Den
ny Murphy were ordered to surrender
their stars. The punishment meted out to
Rial was severe in view of the slightness
of his offense. On April 21 he was ordered
to guard the Starr KinÂ»? School on Bryant
street from the window-breaking attacks
of the children In the neighborhood. He
obeyed orders in a measure, but was
drawn away from his Ftation by a base
ball game.
The Police Commissioners gave evi
dence last night that they â¢will not deal
leniently with officers brought before
them for Infractions of rules of the de

TWO STARS DIMMED BY
POLICE COMMISSIONERS
After Mrs. Place had closed. Attorneys
Partridge and Jacobs, who had heard of
the charges made by Miller, appeared be
fore the board and denied they had made
any such statements.
Miller then took the stand in his own
behalf. He claimed Mrs. Place had con
ditioned him without cause, and accused
her of being prejudiced. She had changed
him with being mentally unbalanced and*
not fit to receive a diploma, and had told
falsehoods to bolster up her charges.
Mrs. Place testified in her own behalf.
She denied the charges, and gave an ex
3>lanatlon of the reason why she condi
tioned Miller. He was not evenly bal
anced, she said, and would never make a
teacher. .- *

lacked tact.

BY A RUNAWAY
HORSE'S HOOFS
James F. Rowe, a Laborer,
Knocked Down and Fa

and the horse bolted. Baumert clung to
the reins, but was thrown out of the
wagon. . Willow avenue Is about half a
block from: where Rowe and several oth
ers were working, and when thev saw the
maddened animal approaching they start
ed to scatter. Three of them besides
Rowe were knocked down, but not in
lured. Rowe was directly In front of the
horse, and when he was knocked ' down
the animal's hoofs struck him on the back
of the head, fracturing the base of the
skull. Rowe was picked up in an uncon
scious condition and taicen to the Re
ceiving Hospital in the ambulance, but
died In about an hour, and the body was
removed to the Morgue. He was about
50 years old and lived at 2233 San Antonio

Officials Making Ready for Initial
Through Trips From Chicago to
San Francisco.
If all the promises of the Santa Fe and
San Joaquln Valley Railroad officials
fructify, the Santa Fe will run a through
passenger train from Chicago to San
Francisco between the first and the middle
of June. Plans, schedules, time-tables,
etc., are now under course of preparation
and definite announcements will soon bo
made.
General Superintendent Wella, who Is
stationed at Los Angeles, has been in this
city during the last few days conferring
with the local officials. He thinks it very
likely that a general conference between
the local representatives and the officers
of the Santa Fe at Chicago will be held
during the latter part of the month to
complete arrangements for the passenger
service of the through line.
Every day carloads of freight are landed
in this city on the through route of the
Santa Fe. The new ferry boat will be
commissioned soon and all necessary de
tails arranged for the initial trip.

A warrant for the arrest of Colonel
Theodore C. Marceau Is in the hands of
the Sheriff. The doughty colonel has
fled the city with Baby Theo and
has returned to Los Angeles. After
leaving Judge Troutt's court Monday
morning Colonel Marceau and little Theo
walked forth into the void of seclusion.
This act on the colonel's part has turned
the tables and he now occupies the same
position as that into which he. forced
hia former wife by charging her with fel
ony, when she fled from Los Angeles with
her 'baby boy.
The light for Baby Theo daily Increases
irrHnterest. Shortly after the conclusion
of the hearing on Monday before Judge
Troutt a writ of habeas corpus sworn to
by Mrs. Flske-Marceau-Fennell was is
sued, commanding Colonel Marceau to
produce the child in court this morning
that his custody might be awarded pend
ing the disposition of the appeal from the
order made by Judge Troutt ratifying the
agreement entered into between the par
ents. .In her petition for the writ Mrs.
Flske-Marceau-Fennell alleges that her
child was unlawfully Imprisoned, detained,
coniined and restrained of his liberty by
Theodore C. Marceau and that upon her
best knowledge, information and belief
the child was so Imprisoned at the Palace
Hotel.' ' . t â
Upon the issuance of the writ it was
placed in the hands of the Sheriff for
service. Inquiry at the Palace Hotel elic
ited the information that the colonel was
not in. Later reports were to the effect
that he had fled the city and several
Deputy Sheriffs started out on his trail.
Colonel Marceau's absence from the hotel
was reported to Attorney Louis P. Board
man, who represents Mrs. Flske-Marceau-
Fennell. and she forthwith made affi
davit that to the best of her knowledge
and belief the doughty" colonel was will
fully evading process of the court ana
unless taken into custody would evade
service of* the writ, and flee beyond the
Jurisdiction of the court. Upon this affi
davit Judge Dunne Issued a bench war
rant for the arrest of Colonel Marceau
and the detention of Baby Theo pending
the hearing of the writ.- â¢
A â¢ telegram from Los Angeles states
that Colonel Marceau and Theo arrived
there yesterday. They appeared on the
streets together, and Marceau apparently
made no effort -to conceal his where

say, "Hold up your hands." Turning his

ThÂ« young man jrivlng- his name ' as
George I>ogan, which he admits is not'
his true name, does not appear to be as
hardened a criminal as Cronin. He stated
yesterday that he handed one of the pis
tols found en Cronin to him while they
were going to jail in the patrol wagon.
He will most likely know something of
whatever crimes Cronin may have com
mitted lately, and fears of a State prison
cell may cause him to break down and
give up what he knows. He will probably
be liberated if he does this. Even the
drubbing he got. in the battle on Kearny
street with Sergeants Christiansen and
Mahoney and Officer McGee has not en
tirely tamed Cronin. He was still sullen
and muttering threats when taken with
his pal before Judge Mogan yesterday.
Both men pleaded guilty, Cronin to
charges of disturbing the peace and car
rying a concealed weapon and the other
man to those of battery and disturbance.
They will be before Judge Mogan at 10
o'clock this morning for sentence.
These two men are supposed to have
robbed the postofflee safe at Benicia last
Sunday morning. The bulldog pistol
found on Cronin was identified yesterday
by Deputy Sheriff Malone of that town
as one taken from the eafe.
The* police records here show that Cro
nin, in companv with a man named Ed
ward Ryan, "stood up" a man named
Frank Golden m this city on the night
of July 24, 1S03. and robbed him of his
watch and $4 in coin. Cronin was sent to
State prison for several years for this
crime. ; Â» -
At the time he committed this robbery
Cronin had just completed a term of two
\vars in the penitentiary for robbing a
Mission-street shoe store.
It is now known that Cronin broke out
of the Placer County Jail at Auburn
about May 1. a few days before the Bortz
raeyer hold-up, which was on May 3. If
he made his way to San Francisco on
foot, trying to escape capture and per
haps traveling at night, he would natur
ally reach here dirty and ragged and
rc-ady to commit murder for any sum of
money.

Bortzmeyer's assailant.
In the '"upper office" at police headquar
ters yesterday little was said as to the
probability o* Cronin being- the man
guilty of the black deed on Ellis street.
Captain Seymour simply said when ques
tioned that Cronin mig-ht be the man and
that he would not say he was not. Detec
tives were out all day on the case and it
was thought they were paying a good deal
more attention to the theory that Cronin

being given out.
That Cronin is ju5t the man to commit
such a crime is certain. One glance at
him and his record is enough to convince
anybody of this. In appearance he is
everything that goes to make up a human
cougar, ready to spring in the dark and
utterly unconcerned as to whether death
were the result of any of his acts. His
record shows him to be a highwayman,
sa.fecracker and Jailbreaker. The fact
that he Â¦was sent to the State Prison once
for highway robbery shows that that is
Included in his repertoire of crimes.
Generally the description of Cronin tal
lies with that given by Bortzmeyer of
the man who shot him. He is about five

tache, large lips and a peculiarly promi

Bortzmeyer describes his assailant as
a man of very short build, rather stocky
and with a prominent chin. He wore a
soft black hat. He had evidently not
been shaved for several days and seemed
very dirty and -ragged. Whether he had

on the part of his- wife, and he, made up
his mind that he v/ould no longer live
with her. He says he forcibly wrested
the weapon from her grasp before she
could fire another shot, and left his home
after telling her of his determination to
live apart from her.
