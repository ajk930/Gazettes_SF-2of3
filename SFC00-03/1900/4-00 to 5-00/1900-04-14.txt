ADOLFH SOHER, A FUGITIVE FROM JUSTICE.
to enjoy their dishonest gain have again
been filled and the inheritance of a family
that could 111 epare a loss has been taken
away. The name of an honest man has
gone and the names of the race track
gamblers are still legion. The story that
now adds to the sad many which San
Francisco has heard is a pitiful, one.
Adclph Soher. administrator by suf- |
frage for years past of th^ estate of his j
Af-aA father. Dr. Lewis Soher. now rests
under the stigma that falls upon those
known to be fugitives from justice. Like
many before him. who have been drawn
ir.to the pitfalls of ruin, his future offer
ed as good as life affordsâ honor and hon
orable position in the service of the Gov
ernmentâuntil he feil a victim to temp
tation. A few days ago, however â early
thls wÂ»ckâ the thought of prison bars ar.d
a life behind them came uppermost, in his
rr.lnd, and. tearing away from the ten
tacles that hold a gambler to a lif* that
hnp*>s for gain through the medium of
racetracks and their managers, he fled
the city, an embezzler in the cum of $22,- i

heartbroken through her knowledge of j
his peculations. Mrs. Soher, wife of the j
fugitive, paces her rooms in a downtown ;
hotel, the name ard location of which is !
withheld that the unfortunate woman j
may not be made to suffer more through j
the Inquiry of anxious friends ar.d the I
demands of excited heirs and creditors.
Mrs. Soher is the daughter of Ben K.
Thorn, California's oldest Sheriff. For
twenty-r.ine years Mr. Thorn has been in
the service of the people of Calaveraa
County, the old stamping ground of
Joaquln Murietta, the notorious bandit,
and scores of his ilk. No man is better
known in all the West than Mr. Thorn,
ar.d the sorrow that has fallen to his
daughter's lot will be the sorrow of the
mar.y who know the father.
Yielded to Temptation.
Though Sober possessed a strong mind,
not easily yielding to temptation, and one
which for twenty years held him upper
most in the respect of the Postoffice au
thoritks by whom he was employed, the
glamor of the racetrack, the hope of sud
don gain at Tar.foran or Oakland, led him
from a life of honest pursuit, caused him
to forget wife and family and has left
upen him :he brand that follows those of
his kind through life to its end. His
brothers ar.d sisters, heirs with him to the
estate of his- deceased father, will not be

Victim of Racetrack Gambling.
Ado!ph Soher fell because the passion
for racetrack Rambling laid hold of him
with an irresistible grasp. When he had
placed to his own credit in bank the many
thousands that accrued from the sale of
his late father's property, according- to
the court's order, a vision of great pros
pective wealth spread before him. and he
beg-an to use the money which he held in
trust. In his own eyes the salary which
he received from the Government was
not only meager beyond description, but
slow in its monthly advent. The racetrack
was tfce means by which Adolph Soher
Fought to build a fortune by sudden bold
jumps.
At the very beginning of the year
Sofcer's dislike for the routine labor of
the postcffice "weighed so heavily upon
his disposition" that he determined to cut
it out of his life, at any rate for the time
being. With the fever of gambling in his
veins, he secured a leave of absence for
three months and then began a daily Â¦visi
tation to the racetrack- His Intention at
first was to play lightly, but loss upon
loss drove him deeper and deeper Into the
mire, from which he could extricate him
self only by a Correspondingly heavy re
coupment. From Oakland to Tanforan
and from Tanforan to Oakland he fol
lowed the horses, rarely missing a race.
A Heavy Bettor.
with a bag full of money he would cross
the bay or board a train and place big
sums on every race on the card. It was
not long before Soher became a well
known and familiar figure on the track.
Around town he met all the racetrack
habitues and many other men of sporting
proclivities, Forae of whom borrowe<l
money from him for the same purpose of
amassing wealth by "easy" means. Grant
Israel gave him an I. O. U. for $700, most
of which was placed on a horse that did
not win. And there were others who
helped deplete the 122.000 bank roll that
came from the sale of property that bo
longed not to him alone but to all of the
heirs of the Soher estate alike.
Soher as a Litigant.
In November of last year Soher first
brought himself into public notice by
causlng a complaint to be registered
against a friend in whose hands he placed
several hundred dollars ostensibly to be
placed on a "straight tip" at the track.
Whether or not the "friend" played the
tip Is not known, but as he "never came
back" Soher decided to prosecute him.
Soher's determination to prosecute, how
ever, availed him but little, as the friend
Ls still at large.
A month before this proceeding Soher
occupied the unenviable position of plain
tiff In a unique suit to recover damages,
brought by James King, proprietor of the
Hotel Francisco, Turk and Taylor streets.
Soher refused to pay his rent and King
sued. Soher. in a cross-complaint, said
that the constant demands of the landlord
had affected his wife's heart and had con
fined her to her bed for a period of six
THE expose of the gigantic local
ring dealing In coolie citizens
made yesterday by The Call
startled the people of San Fran
cisco. The outrageous traffic of
making native-born American cit
izens and voters out of coolies was the
therre of general comment. For nearly
three years the wretched business has
been in prosperous progress, shielded by
the practical secrecy of the Chinese Bu
reau, which offers no check or hindrance.
Month after month "native sons" have
been admitted, and now after thirty-four
months of service Colonel John P. Jack
son has to his discredit the astounding
record of having admitted. to a residence
and citizenship 3000 Chinese slaves. Thesu
facts are startling, but they cannot be
controverted, and they tell only one phasy
of the operations of the criminal con
spiracy to defeat the exclusion act.
The members of the ring were not In
their accustomed haunts yesterday. There
was dullness and inactivity in the Chinese
Bureau, and no coolie laden wagons were
speeding from the Mail dock Into China
town. A lull had come In the disgraceful
business and the ringsters were tem
porarily under cover. At the dock of the
Pacific Mall Steamship Company the in
spectors of the Chinese Bureau resumed
their farcical examinations in the after
noon." The same simple, absurd routine
cf questioning which was exploited yes
terday by The Call was the order of the
day, but visitors were not welcome. The
story of the steamer China is to be re
peated In another of the Doric. "
Some conception of the tremendous
character of the traffic In "native sons"
may be gained from the fact that ' tha
Doric has forty-one on boar.!., The China
had forty-nine, a total of ninety "native
born" coolie citizens arriving and de
manding admission and citizenship in ten
days. And yet this mill of scoundrels has
been In uninterrupted operation for near
ly three years. Collector Jackson and the
authorities of the Chinese Bureau insist

tive born dtlaens of the United States,
entitled each to a vote and all the privi
leges of a citizen.
Collector Jackson insists that the law
gives him the right to do as he has done
In connection with Chinese "native sons."
No one has ever disputed the fact, but
Collector Jackson does not add that he
also has the power under the law to do
as he has not done, to refer all "native
born" cases to the courts, where a thor
ough Investigation made by competent
men can be bad to determine the place
of nativity. Collector Jackson declared
over a year ago that he intended to refer
all "native born" cases to the courts for
determination. He said he knew the dan
ger of handling them. He probably has
a reason for not doing as he promised.
In outlining and characterizing the ring
of Chinese lawyers yesterday the name of
one precious member of the gang was
omitted. It was not mentioned because Its
owner bears no relation to that official
circle which gives power and capacity for
fraud. Colonel George H. Pippy. Frank
V. Bell and George A. - McGowan have
powerful friends and are deservedly to be
ranked as the leaders In the outrageous
traffic that not only menaces the city but
has already injured It. They are-the con
spirators in chief, but In the odium that
attaches to their wretched business Gas
ton Straus, the partner of Bell, should
not be forgotten. Straus works among
the Chinese, speaking their language and
a Iying-ln hospital at that. These 600 "na
tive sons," like the remaining 2400 of Colo
nel Jackson's other native-born citizens,
all remembered the house they were born
In, the street and 'the number and the
floor. It is strange that not one of them
should forget this important fact. It
might puzzle some Americans to remem
ber a similar fact in connection with- their
own lives, but the Chinese have good
memories and careful parents.
Collector. Jackson has not noticed either
that nearly all of his "native-born" citi
zens divide their birthplaces among three
houses in Chinatown, one of which Is 913
Dupont street, " where Colonel George H.
Plppy's "native son" Lee Woo first saw
the light of day, but not with his eyes. The
other two houses are the Globe Hotel, on
the northwest corner of Dupont and Jack
son streets, and the building on the south
east corner of Commercial and Dupont
streets. It would seem that Chinese did
not breed in any other part of Chinatown.
i If Collector of the Port Jackson had re
membered these things ; and associated
with them facts that usually suggest
themselves to intelligent men, the people
of San Francisco would not now be dis
cussing" the deeply significant fact that In
thirty-four months over. 10,000 Chinese
have forced the barriers of the Exclusion
act, and' that "among them "and the very
dregs of them all, the most degraded la
borers and debased coolies, are 3000 na-
i that they are Intelligent men, capable of
conducting their business. Yet they have
been unable to discover anything of un
usual interest in the startling fact that
the vast majority of the 3000 "native
born" citizens which they have admitted
to San Francisco left this city before June
6, ISS2. As men .who know their business
Collector Jackson and the officers of the
Chinese Bureau should know that these
coolie slaves, who are now "native sons,"
say they left before June 6, ISS2, because
after that day the Government has a rec
ord .of every departing Chinese. Such a
palpable fraud would deceive no one. Yet
the officials are now dealing with over
four score of these same precious "na
tives," who arrived on the China and the
Doric. * Nearly all of the "natives", on the
China left their "native" land before that
interesting date. If Collector Jackson no
ticed nothing strange in the fatal date
the " Pippy-Bell-McGowan ring did, and
took advantage of it;
There is another significant fact In con
nection with' the Importation of "Chinese
slaves, as -"native sons" that Collector
Jackson probably has not noticed. He will
find by inspecting the records of the Chi
nese â¢ bureau * that 600 of his native-born
Chinese citizens Rnd voters were born in
a single house in Chinatown, and It Is not.

Victim of the Gamblers Flees From
the State to Escape Arrestâ The
Stolen Money Secured by the
American Surety Company.
THE race track and its gambling
harpies have added another name to
their long roll of victims and an
other crime has been added to the
ghastly record which has brought
shame and distress, dishonor and death to
to many cf the people of this city. The
gamblers of the race course have dis
graced and destroyed another home of
San Francisco. They have sent another
yourg man !r:io f.ight a fugitive from
Justice and from the reproaches of those
he has robbed.
The coffers of the men who invade the
State to prey upon its people and leave it
lands. Five hundred thousand dollars, ne
said, represented the American Surety
Company's loss during the past year
through the embezzlement of its clients
and its name was scarce heard of in the
courts as such a loser. Widber. the trust
ed Treasurer of this city and county,
Â¦whose peculations amounted to SIOO.O.X) and
more, was not on his list; neither were
many more whose crimes are of public
knowledge. Still, out of the coffers of his
company those who have been led astray
by the temptations of the track -and the
gaming table have lifted half a million
dollars. In this the moral rests, but in
dealing with them. Bell works at th*
Custom-house, and between the two the
factory of "native sons." "merchants."
"tourists" and "students" la maintained.
Startling as was the expose of The Call
yesterday, it was not the entire story oC
the operations of the audacious and dan
gerous ring In this city. The favored at
torneys who enjoy friendship of officiate
and land native sons, merchants, tour
ists and students have worked with such
remarkable success that the local Chi
nese slave dealers and some merchants
expected soon to have more work for
them to do. It was to be work in their
own peculiar sphereâ the landing of
slaves In San Francisco. The only differ
ence was that the slaves were to be
women and not men.
Not long ago the United States Supreme
Court rendered a decision In which it
ruled that the wives of merchants are en
titled to a landing in this country. This
was the very opportunity for which the
Chinese slave dealers In this country had
been waiting for years. The most rigid
efforts have been made at this port to
exclude Chinese women slaves. The ting
deals in men, not In women, by no vir
tuous scruples, but simply because It has
been easier to land men than to land
women. Hordes of "merchants" have
been landed and now the Supreme Court

"I object," shouted Burton of Ohio, em
phatically.
Following Burton's notice 'of objection
Hepburn took steps to overcome this ob
jection. A petition to the Com
mittee on Rules was prepared, re
questing that body, to fix a 'time
for taking up the canal bill. Hepburn
circulated the petition on the Republican

obtained Blxty-one signatures. He said
he considered this a good showing, con
sidering the small attendance. Adamson,
who circulated the petition on the Demo

"There is no opposition whatever on this

signed the petition. If the attendance
had been larger we would have had many
more signatures, but as it Is," the number

CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLING
TON HOTEL. WASHINGTON, April 13.â
Authoritative Information has been re
ceived here confirming the report that
Great Britain, France, Germany and Italy
recently addressed a joint note to the
Tsung LI Yamen demanding that China
take measures within two months to sup
press the "boxers" and threatening in
case of refusal to take forcible measures
themselves to establish order In the em
pire. Russia did not Join in the note for
the reason that she is an "Asiatic power"
and it would be inadvisable for her to
take any such action.
The best Information obtainable here is
that Minister Conger did not sign the joint
note, though it is understood he addressed
a communication to the Tsung Li Yamen
demanding In strong terms that measures
be taken for the suppression of the soci
ety and that American citizens and their
interests be fully protected.
There is a disposition in official circles
to believe that China will not seriously at
tempt to comply with the demands of the
powers, but at the end of the time limit
fixed will endeavor to secure an exten
sion. It is hoped that the assembling of
warships at Taku will Impress upon the
Chinese Government the fact that Europe
means that foreigners in China shall not
be subject to outrageous attacks and that
the anti-foreign society must be disbanded
and Its ringleaders imprisoned and pun
ished.

SACRAMENTO. April 13.â The Impor
tant piece of news in baseball cir
cles at this hour is the announce
ment that "Jay" Hughes, the peer
less pitcher of the Brooklyn pen
nant winners, has become a member of
; the GIH Edge nine of Sacramento after
refusing an offer of J2COO and $200 traveling
expenses from the Brooklyns for a term
of service of eight months. The question
as to whether "Jay" Hughes would re
turn to Brooklyn or stay in Sacramento
remained in the balance until 7:30 o'clock
to-night, when, after a consultation with
the local representatives, Hughes au
thorized The Call correspondent to say
that he would decline the Brooklyn offer
and stay in Sacramento. The news will
be received with enthusiasm by the loversÂ»
of the game in Sacramento.
Some idea of the public estimation of
Hughes' ability may be gained from the
fact that a couple of days ago Harry R.
Blair of this city, who is an enthusiastic
attendant cf the ball games, though not
even in the remotest sense connected with
their management, started out among his
merchant friends to raise a purse of $800
to be paid to Hughes as a bonus to induce
him to stay here, without respect to the
handsome salary which the Gilt Edges
have promised him.
Staid members of the Chamber of Com
merce have not only contributed their pro
rata to the purse_ but have even aided in
the circulation of the petition among their
associates. This fund has been completed
and will prove a factor in keeping Hughes
here. But while Hughes will not lose any
thing In "a financial way In declining the
Brooklyns' tempting offer, there has been
a more potent consideration than coin In
moving Hughes to his decision. Last week
Jay Hughes led to the altar a Sacramento
girl. Miss Mary Waters, and his wire pre
fers this city to any place on earth. Jay
is as bashful as a schoolboy about his love
affair, and nobody knew of his marriage
until some days after its occurrence. The
event took place a week ago, Rev. Father
Quinn performing the ceremony, and Miss
Josephine Waters, a sister of the bride,
acting as bridesmaid and John Haverlan,
a friend of the groom, as best man.
"Jay has made the home-run of his
life," declare his friends, and all the gold
of the Eastern clubs will not now drag
him away from the fireside which he has
created In Sacramento.
POPULISTS AND
DEMOCRATS OF
OREGON UNITE
Silver Republicans Held No
Convention, but Joined
the Others.
Chicago Platform With the Fusion
Money Plank of 1896 Is R3
afnrmed and Bryan
Indorsed.
PORTLAND, Or., April 13.â The State
conventions of the Democrats and Popu
lists after being in session for two days
effected a fusion of the two parties and
adjourned this evening.
The Silver Republicans also joined In the
fusion movement, though they held no
convention. Both the Democrats and
Populists indorsed W. J. Biyan for the
Presidential nomination, but the Populist
delegates to the National Convention were
Instructed to vote for no other Democrat
for. the nomination for President and to
vote only for a Populist for Vice Presi
dent. During the debate on the adoption
I of the confeience report F. V. Holrnan, a
well known Gold Democrat of Portland,
entered a vigorous protest against fusion
with the Populists. Mr. Hoiman said the
Democratic party is great enough and
broad enough to take in every voter who
is opposed to Mr. McKinley and the poli
cies of the Republican party. If the Pop
ulists wish to support Democratic canai
dates let them do so.
'"I' believe the issue of free coinage ot
silver is no longer a living issue. I wish
so long as possible to contribute succesa
and triumph of Democratic principles as
I understand them and to support the
Democratic candidate for President. Bui
1 am a Democratâ not a Populist. This
convention was called a Democratic con
vention and to nominate a Democratic
ticket â not. to nominate, support or in
dorse Populist candidates as such. If
there are any candidates to be chosen by
this convention, let them be nominated a3
Democrats and only as Democrats."
The following is the fusion ticket com
plete:
Justice of the Supreme Court, William
Ramsey, Democrat.
Food and Dairy Commissioner, William
M. Schulmerich, Populist.
Congressmenâ First District, Bernard
Daly, Democrat; Second District, William
C. Smith, Populist.
, Presidential Electorsâ Ernest- Kroner,
Populist; John Whittaker, Populist; Dell
Stuart, Democrat; W. M. Pierce, Demo
crat.
The Populists receive three and the
Democrats six District Attorneys In the
State.
The fusion platform as adopted reaf
firms in Its entirety the Chicago platform
of 1896 and the money plank adopted by
the fusionlsts of Oregon in IS9S, which de
clared for the free and unlimited coinage
of silver at the ratio of 16 to 1. The plat
form favors en Income tax, the election ot
United States Senators by direct vote oi
the people and the Initiative and referen
dum, and opposes Government by injunc
tion.
On the Philippines It says: "The Fili
pinos cannot be citizens without endanger
ing our civilization; they cannot be sub
jects without endangering our form of
government. We favor an immediate*
declaration of the nation's purpose to
give to the Philippinesâ first, a stable form
of government; second, independence, and
third, protection from outside interfer
ence. We favor the expansion of trade by
every legitimate and peaceful means, but
we are opposed to purchasing trade at
the cannon s mouth with human blood."
Sympathy is expressed for the Boers,
and the Porto Rican tariff bill is con
demned.
The platform demands that articles con
trolled by trusts shall be placed on the
free list and that laws be enacted that
will effectually suppress and destroy all
trusts. Government ownership of the tel
egraph is Indorsed.
The middle-of-the-road Populist con
vention, with nine delegates present, nom
inated a ticket and elected seventeen dele
gates to the national convention at Cin
cinnati.

BATTLE FOR POSSESSION
OF DOROTHY WAINWRIGHT
Her Guardian Claims She Is Be-
strained of Her, Liberty by Her
Grandfather.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, \ April 13.â Harry H.
Walnwrlght, a coal dealer of San Fran
cisco, to-day obtained a writ of habeas
corpus in the Supreme Court here as a
preparatory step to- a' big battle which
will shortly be waged for the guardian
ship of Dorothy Walnwright, a minor. '
In the application for the writ Waln
wright alleges that on the death of hi.s
brother, Edward Walnwright, his niece,
Dorothy Walnwright, was assigned, to
gether with her estate, into his guardian
ship, and that she is being imprisoned and
restrained of her liberty by her grand
father, Theodore Van Tassel of Sausalito.
The Illegality of this action as set forth
in the application consists in the fact that
the child is withheld from the custody and
control of Walnwright, who is her quali
fied guardian. Dorothy Walnwright, the
bone of contention, last week went to Van
Tassel's house at Sausalito to visit her
sister Edith, who was adopted -by the
Van .Tassels on the death of their daughter
and the children's mother. She has ever
since then been at Van Tassel's house and
Wainwright claims that she Is kept there
by forcible means. â¢
Last Monday Van Tassel made applica
tion to the Superior Court of Marln for
letters of adoption on behalf of Edith
Walnwright. van Tassel claims that the
child is compelled to perform menial labor
by Henry walnwright and Is otherwise 111
treated. Judge M. C. Dufflcy, who Is act
inic in behalf of Van-Tassel, claims'that
his client Is within the la.w in retaining
possession of his . granddaughter. The
writ of habeas corpus is made returnable
on April 29, when the motion will .be
heard before Superior Judge Angellottl.
Oliver Ellsworth Is acting as Wain
wright's attorney.

PRESIDENT M'KINLEY'S
SECRETARY RESIGNS
111-Health Causes Mr. Porter's With
drawal and He Is Succeeded by
Â¦/V George B. Cortelyou.
WASHINGTON, April 13.â Owing to
continued 111 health, John Addlson Porter,
secretary to the President, has tendered
his resignation and the President has ac
cepted it, to take effect on May 1 next.
George B. Cortelyou of New York, the
present assistant secretary, has been ap
pointed to succeed him.
Mr. Porter's health was seriously im
paired about a year ago by a severe at
tack of illness, and since then he has
been at times relieved somewhat from
the onerous duties of his office; but falling
to regain his health and believing that
complete separation from official cares is
essential to his speedy and permanent re
covery, the secretary has been con
strained to tender his resignation, whicti
the President has reluctantly accepted.
His physicians enjoin complete rest and
change, that he may have every facility
for rapid improvement.
Mr. Cortelyou was born In New York
City on July 26, 1562. His grandfather.
Peter Croyleus Cortelyou Sr., for forty
years a member of the type-founding
firm of George Bruce & Co., and his
father, Peter C. Cortelyou Jr., were prom
inent figures In New York^buslness and
social circles a generation ago. In 1884
he. was appointed confidential stenogra
pher In the United States Appraiser's
office at New York, but resigned upon the
change of administration In March. 1885.
In October, 1889, he was appointed private
secretary to the postoffice inspector In
charge at New York, and two years later
became private secretary to Fourth As
sistant Postmaster General Rathbone. He
resigned In March, 1892, but was reap
polnted by Assistant Postmaster General
Maxwell. In November, 1895, he was ap
pointed stenographer to the President and
later executive clerk. He was made as
sistant "secretary In 1808.

PRINTERS DECLARE
AGAINST A STRIKE
Repudiate a Proposition Made by the
International Union's
;i W- President. S : - :'
INDIANAPOLIS, April 13.â The mem
bers of the International Typographical
Union have had a narrow escape from be
ing embroiled In the lockouts and strikes
so general In the other trades throughout
the country. The President of the Inter
national Typographical Union, Samuel B.
Donnelly, returned here from a trip to
Kansas City, and having learned while
there that the Typothetae, the employing
printers' organization, was giving aid to
its Kansas City membership in their fight
with the Kansas City unions Mr. Donnelly
is said to have called the executive coun
cil of the International Typographical
Union together and advocated the calling
out of the job: printers employed by the
members of the Typothetae in all the
large cities.
Mr. Donnelly's colleagues repudiated his
proposition by a vote of four to one, and
after a heated and acrimonious d.scusslon.
lasting throughout the longest session In
the history of the executive council of the
International Typographical Union, it is
said on good authority resolutions severe
ly censuring President Donnelly for dere
liction of duty in connection with the
Plttsburg and Kansas City troubles of the
organization were, adopted, and a policy
governing the future management of the
affairs of the organization in keeping with
the past history of the International Typo
graphical Union was formally declared.
It is said that Mr. Donnelly was insist
ent that a general strike in the book and
job and newspaper offices of Chicago
should be ordered. When met with the
statement from one of his colleagues that
the printers would be beaten in two trays,
he is reported to. have said:
"Well, let us give them a whirl anyway
âat least the newspaper offices. '
The council is said to have vigorously
overruled its chief executive, and the
printers are not likely to become involved
in the general labor troubles.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
HOLLISTER, April 13.â The Mansfield
case went to the jury this morning: after
a trial lasting twenty- two days. After
two hours' deliberation a verdict of not
guilty, was returned. Two other indict
ments against the defendant for the pub
lication of anonymous letters will prob
ably be dropped.
When N. C. Briggs commenced the clos
ing-argument for the State the large
courtroom was packed from bar to gallery
with ; " ladies, whose sympathy was openly
expressed for the defendant. So open was
this that I thunders of applause greeted
the defendant's counsel's remarks and
brought forth a vigorous threat from Judge
Dooling* to fine every offender. So con
fident were these ladies that the jury
would "acquit that many brought their
lunch and made a sort of indoor picnic
in the hall of justice. . The summary of
the case by Mr. Briggs was pitiless in the
solid . array of facts and circumstarices,
each pointing unerringly to the guilt, of
the defendant. As each llnkof the chain
i was forged apprehension took possession
j of the multitude lest the jury should be
! swayed by the remorseless finger of the
clearest' kind of circumstantial evidence.
Yet while the woman's guilt was appar
ently made clear, all hoped and prayed
for acquittal.
After two hours* deliberation the jury
returned with > their verdict, and as the
words -"not guilty" fell from the trem
bling lips of Clerk Piratsky the defendant
gave a shriek and fell limp ! into the
arms of her husband. Then ensued one of
the most remarkable scenes on record.
Women who had waited for hours fell on
the Mansttelds, husband, and wife, and
hug-greii each alternately and then took
turns hugging each other. Each member
of the jury was hugged by the old ladies
who had watched continually every phase
of the trial, and it was some time before
the burly Sheriff could extricate the jury
men so that the court could perform its
duty and discharge them. But two ballots
were taken, the lirst 10 to 2 for acquittal.
The District Attorney has been severely
criticized for the expense caused the
county, but it is money well spent. The
person who writes anonymous letters in
this county hereafter will do It with the
knowledge that he will get a legal run for
his money.

T ONDON, April 14â5 a. m.â Lord Rob
j crts' dispatch yesterday, stating
1 that the Boer advance southward
Â£ . had been checked and that the gar
Â¦" ' rison at Wepener was still offering
stout resistance to the Boer attack, was
almost the first piece of encouraging news
received by the British public for a week.
This has since been supplemented by a re
port from Boer sources which has
reached Aliwal North, to the effect that
the burghers, who were attacking Gal
gety's men at Wepener, have retreated
north, after sustaining heavy losses.
No official confirmation of this report
has been received, but it is entirely con
sistent with the evident British move
! ments in force to relieve the hard
pressed Colonials. Persistent rumors of
fighting at Dewetsdorp, which is twenty
i miles northeast of Wepener, may Indicate
I that a relief force from Bloemfonteln Is
in conflict already with the Boers sta
tioned there. With the arrival of the Brit
ish force at that point and the advent of
the Third Division under Chermside at
Reddersburg the position of the Boer
commandoes at Wepener would be ren
dered a dangerous one!
Evidences that a great movement by
Â¦ Lord Roberts is very imminent, if it has
not already begun, are rapidly multiply
ing.
The Daily Telegraph's correspondent in
the Free State capital Is allowed to tele
graph the statement that "troops are
moving forward."
The Bloemfonteln correspondent of the
Dally Mall sends this somewhat cryptic
message: "There Is nothing whatever to
cause uneasiness. It will presently be
seen that the Boers are just where we
want them. In a word, we are all right."
Silence envelops the movements of tho
British forces north and south of Mafe
king to relieve that town. Cape Town ad
vices state with an air of mystery that
good news Is expected .very soon. There
is evidently no doubt that the condition
of the garrison is becoming desperate.
An editorial note in the Dally Mail avers
that Maf eking is ln a very bad way and
that the hope of relief is far off, as no
force Is advancing from the south.
The War Office announces that 4000
horses will arrive at the Cape this week.
It Is well understood that the animals are
not fit for work until about ten days after
the voyage. Two thousand more are due
at the Cape next week.
The War Office has called out the, re
serve companies of several infantry bat
talions, which will be sent to South Africa
forthwith. .
The Boer peace envoys have documents
the Rome correspondent of the Dally
News saysâ showing that urgent advices
to the Transvaal to wage war were origin
ally made by Germany. This correspond
ent also asserts that Count yon Bulow,
the German Foreign Minister, who was
said to have gone on a visit to a sick
brother, really went to Milan for tho ex
press purpose of conferring with the dele
gates. . â¢
LONDON, April 14. â The Times has the following from Jammersberg, dated April 13:
"Colonel Galgety's force has been surrounded by some thousands of Boers with eight
guns, two 'pompoms' and two Maxims since Monday morning. They gallantly withstood a
heavy attack on Monday and again a night attack on Tuesday; and on Thursday there was a con
tinuous shell and rifle" fire.
"We are confident of being able to repulse any attack. Food is plentiful. Our casualties,
in the circumstances, are small. The brunt of the fighting, and also of the loss, has been borne by-
Cape mounted riflemen."

the prf sumption of guilt raised by the
proofs of the Government. f
The Attorney General takes issue with
Judge Brown us to the correctness of his
ruling, but with a view to the final settle
ment of the question has sent to the chair
men of the Judiciary Committees of both
houses of Congress a draft of a bill which,
if It become a law. will have the effect of
compelling the removal of persons indict
ed for offenses against the United States
from the place of arrest to the district
Â¦where the offense Is committed. The At
torney General sent to Congress with the
draft of his bill an exhaustive argument
? xplainmg the necessity for Its passage.
Speaking of the Green-Gaynor case, the
Attorney Gmeral says:
"The defendants are Indicted for frauds
upon the Government of the gravest na
ture and of very large extent, committed
in connection with a trusted officer of the
engineer corjis. proofs of which are spread
over live or fix years of governmental op
erations at Savannah and Cumberland
Bound; and involve also, to a large ex
tent, technical and scientific facts, capa
ble of proof only by expert witnesses and
a "-ountants and by the production of a
vast tr.-.ss of documentary evidence. The
witneeF's to substantiate the case were
scattered throughout the United States.
an<l It was with exceeding difficulty they
were rrarshaWl for a hearing before the

tenOance was arranged for at the trial be
fore the petit Jury. To compel the Gov
ernment to make out a case of probable
cause twice, once before a Grand Jury
and afterward before a local magistrate in
another Jurisdiction, is Imposing a more
..nerous condition for the punishment of
crime than exists under any other form of
government."

LORD ROBERTS' TACTICS
LONDON, April 14.â The Bloemfonteln
correspondent of tho Times, telegraphing
Friday, says: "Everything is going satis
factorily. Owing to the enemy's enter-,
prise a necessity has ar|sen for a move

strategic reasons troop trains have mo
nopolized the railway for a short period,

"We in Bloemfonteln are full of great
admiration of the calm front with which

following at a secure distance. The Boer
columns are thus enabled to move almost
as quickly as cavalry.
"It is reported that there are 9000 Boers
to the south of Dewetsdorp. The force

ATLANTA, Ga.. April 13.â The situation
In the strike of the telegraphers on the

at midnight for the railroad. Passenger
trains which yesterday arid early this
morning ran from one to five hours late
arrived this afternoon and to-night but
slightly behind schedule time, and freight

SINKING SHIP
DESERTED BY
HER CAPTAIN
Four Men Go Down With the
Georges Croise off San
. 'Domingo.
Passengers Rescued by a Passing
Vessel After Having Been Left
to Their Fate by the .
Steamer's Master.
.
NEW YORK. April 13.-At the bottom
of the sea outside Santo Domingo harbor,
the wreck of the French steamer Georges
Croise has lain for more than two weeks.
Enveloped In the mass of her wreckage
are the bodies of four men â two passen
gers and two sailors. Her captain. Fran
cisco Cathrlen, is alive, but no one knows
his whereabouts. Ho is said to have de
serted his doomed ship and nearly, three
score persons that were aboard of her.
The Clyde line steamship New York,
which arrived to-night, brought the story
of the wreck. Chief Officer John C. Mir
mion gave this account of the venture:
"We were just going Into the harbor of
Santo Domingo and lay clo^e outside the
bar, waiting for our pilot to come out. It
was â¢ the morning of the 2?th of March.
Suddenly a steamer hove into sight to
ward the city, and a minute or two later
we saw that something was wrong
aboard of her. Screams of women and
children, mingled with the distress culls
of the ship's whistle, were clearly heard,
and as fast as possible we lowered five
boats and made for her. We found her
sinking, her port side listing far do^vn
toward the water. No one seemed to bo
lii command and everything seemed to be
in disorder.
â¢"Just as we came up I saw two men
crawl into a small boat- on the opposite
side of the vessel and make off. One of
these, we afterward learned, was the cap
tain. I sent one of my men aboard and
we began to pass down women and chil
dren. They were scantily dressed, some
of the babies being entirely naked. Many
jumped into the water, but the boats be
hind me took care that these were picked
up. When it looked as if all the people
had been rescued I ordered the boats to
pull away. A moment later the steamer
went to the bottom.
"The children numbered about twelve or
fifteen and the women the same. The
sailors from the vessel, the Georges Croise,
bound to Santiago de Cuba, said that
there had been fifty-five persons aboard
and that four were missing."
Down in the forecastle of the New York
three of the rescued sailors told their
story to-night. They said that the cap
tain deserted the ship with the pilot, who
had brought them out. The three sailors
are Joe Martha, Francisco Pla and An
tonio Delgao.
Martha was the last man to leave the
ship alive. He says that the lost wen?
Dom Pepe Valle, a rich Cuban, who owned
the ship's cargo of cattle; the second
cook, a fireman and an unknown passen
ger. Valle, according to the sailors, had
in a belt that he continually wore $3000 in
gold. His cattle, which constituted the
whole cargo, numbered 240. together with
eight horses and seventeen calves. The
fireman who was lost was the man who
gave the alarm of the ship's disaster.
Subsequent investigations made in Santo
Domingo by the passengers showed that
the captain had reached the shore in
safety and had reported the wreck to the
United" States Consul there. Before his
former companiens arrived, however, he
had disappeared and nothing further could
be heard of him.- The pilot, too, dis
appeared. -

ELECTION OF
SENATORS BY
DIRECT VOTE
House Adopts the Resolution
for a Constitutional
Amendment.
Of the Two Hundred and Fifty-Five
Members Present and Voting
Only Fifteen Oppose the .
Innovation.
>
WASHINGTON, April 13.â The House
to-day by a vote of 240 to 15 adopted a
r^sojution fcr a constitutional amendment
providing for the election of United States
Senators by direct vote of the people.
Fourteen Republicans and one Democrat
voted against it. By the terms of the res
olution the amendment to be submitted
5s as follows:
The Senate of the United States shall be com
r""?e<l of two Senators from each State, who
fha.ll be elected by a direct vote of the people
thereof, for a term of tnx years, and each Sen
ator thsUl hay* one vote. A plurality of the
v<-tes cast for oandldatee for Senator shall be
rufScir-nt to elect. The electors in each State
Fh8l! have the qualifications requisite for elec
tors or the most numerous branch of the State
l>>e:s!stures. respectively.
When a vacancy happens by death. reslF^a
ti'-n or otherwise in the representation of
State !a the Senate, the same shall be filled
for the unerplred term thereof in' the rarpe
ir.anner as Is pro\-lded for the election of Sena
tors in paragraph 1; â¢
Provided, that the executive thereof may
ir.ake temporary appointment until the next
pfneral or special election. In accordance with
the statutes or constitution of such State.
Fifteen Negative Votes.
The majority resolution had left it op
tional with the States whether their Sen
ators should be elected directly by the
Legislatures. The minority resolution
msde it incumbent that each State elect
by direct vote. The minority resolution,
â¢which was offered as a substitute, was
voted upon first and was carried by an
overwhelming vote â ayes 135, noes 30.
Corliss tried unavailingrly to pet an aye
r.nd no vote, but only nine members sec
onded the demand. The vote was then
taken upon the adoption of the amend
ment by ayes and noes, the whole House
seemingly rising in support of the de
mand.

of New Jersey, Hedge of lowa, Henry of
Connecticut. Lane of lowa. Lester of
Georgia. I.ittlefield of Maine, McPherson

necticut, Sperry of Connecticut and
Thomas of lowa.
The remainder of the day was devoted
tn the consideration of private pension
l>il!e. During the course of the debate
thrre were several sharp attacks upon
Talbert <D.* of South Carolina for his
course in delaying action on bills. Sib
ley of Pennsylvania said a pimple caulcu
!atlon would show that it cost $36,<XW a
day for a session of the House, or $7000
en hour. The time frittered away by Tal
bert since he ame to Congress, he said,
Â¦would more than pay all the special nen-
Ffon bills passed during that period. Nor

Admiral Yet Believes That He Will
Be Able to Cany the Kansas

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. WELLING
TON HOTEL. WASHINGTON. April 13.â
Admiral Dewey's political statement prob
ably will be ready to be given out for pub
lication next Tuesday. He is still waiting
to hear from some of his sound money
Democratic friends in New York before
giving out the important document. He
believes that he has behind him all the
sound money Democrats In the East and
the South, and in conversation with his
political friends he says that he is a sound
money Jefferson Democrat.
On the expansion issue he occupies mid
dle ground between the President and Mr.
Bryan. He is neither an imperialist nor
an anti-expansionist. He believes in re
storing order in the Philippines and then
holding the islands and awaiting develop
ments, probably In the end turning them
over to a native government under a
United States protectorate.
The admiral receives a large amount of
mall dally from prominent men in ail
parts of the country, principally from
business men and sound money Demo
crats.
He believes that New York will send
uninstructed delegates to the Kansas City
convention, thac the New Jersey delegates
can be controlled in his favor and that he
will have support from other Eastern
States. He expects most of his original
support from the Eastern States, but he
believes that when the proper time comes
the convention can be carried by storm
for him. just as the Chicago convention
four years ago was swept off Its feet for
Mr. Bryan.
He was much gratified to-day to receive
an invitation Irom New Orleans to visit
that city, and when he goes to Detroit on
June 6 it is his intention to take a swing
around the circle and go to New Orleans
on his return.
DEWEY AND BRYAN
TO MEET IN CHICAGO
CHICAGO, April 13.â Admiral Dewey
and William Jennings Bryan will meet on
Tuesday evening. May 1. for the first time
since the hero of Manila announced that
he was a Presidential candidate. All
doubt as to Mr. Bryan's presence was dis
pelled to-day when Max J. Riese of the
Lakeside* Club received a telegram from
him, paying that he would cancel previous
engagements In order to be present at
that organization's celebration, which is a
part of the general programme. Both of
the distinguished guests are aware of the
prospective meeting. The officials of the
club did not arrange that they should be
present at the same event until each had
been consulted. In reply, Mr. Bryan and
the admiral said that, far from being ob
jectionable, the meeting would give them
pleasure.
WOULD GATHER
FARM-OWNERS
INTO A TRUST
Plan to Effect a World
Combine of Agricultural
Interests.
Its Promoters Hope to Decrease the
Wheat Acreage and Thus
Cause a Rise in
Prices.
â¢
MINNEAPOLIS, April 13.â The Journal
says: All the farmers of the world in a
sort of international trust to restrict the
production of wheat and raise prices is
the plan which it is hoped to carry Into
effect at the international agricultural
conference in Paris July 9 to 16. It is pro
posed to ask the farmers of the world to
reduce their wheat output by 20 per cent
and not to sell a bushel for less than a
dollar. -*.'-Â¦'"
J. C. Hanley of St, Paul, executive agent
of the Farmers' Alliance and Industrial
Union, the National Cotton Growers' As
sociation.'the Farmers' Federation of the
Mississippi Valley and the National Grain
Growers' Association, is the chief pro
moter in the agricultural trust In Amer
ica, Professor G. Ruhland of the Univer
sity of Fribourg, Switzerland, is the chief
promoter of the plan in Europe. The
idea was conceived by these two men in
dependently.
Mr. Hanley, who has been interested In
many hold-your-wheat schemes, Is prom
inently associated with the Farmers' Ele
vator and various co-operative undertak
ings. He has long believed that if the
farmers would only come to an under
standing as to limiting production and
agree to sell only when their price could
be obtained they could easily master the
situation.
As a professor of economics Professor
Ruhland had come to the same conclu
sion. His study of the agrarian problems
of different countries led him to believe
that the only cure for the widespread
troubles of the farmers, which are more
severe in the Old than in the New World,
is to restrict production.
Both were hard at work getting the
idea into practice when they encoun
tered one another through correspond
ence. Since then they have been working
with a common idea, viz.â to persuade the
International Agricultural Congress to in
dorse the plan and recommend it to the
various national associations for appli
cation next year.
While a 20 per cent reduction in acreage
is desired, Mr. Hanley points out that if
only 5 per cent can be secured the world's
wheat crop would be reduced about 125.
000,000 bushels, which is, he says, enough
to bring the price up to $1. To help out
the effect of the restricted production the
farmers are to hold their wheat for ninety
days and are to market it at no less than
$1 a bushel.
"Almost everything the farmer buys."
said Mr. Hanley. "is regulated in price by
some trust. On the other hand, all that
the farmer sells has its price determined
by the competition of all the rest of the

BENCH SHOW PROSPECTS.
With the beginning of next week the
office of the San Francisco Kennel Club
at 328 Montgomery street will be open.un
til 9 p. m. dally for the purpose of re
ceiving entries. There can be no doubt
that the coming show will be the largest
ever held west of Chicago. The entries
already made exceed in number those of
the same date last year by double. In
spite of the wide publicity given to the
fact many inquiries are being made as to
the necessity of a pedigree for the pur
pose of exhibiting a dog. A pedigree is
entirely unnecessary. In entering a dog
in the puppy class, however,' the rules of
the American Kennel Club require that
the date of birth, name of breeder and
the names of the sire and dam be given.
In all other classes, where these particu
lars are unknown, it suffices to state that
fact on the entry blank.
The classes for trick dogs are an In
novation in ah American â¢ bench show,
though they are quite frequent at En
glish shows. From present appearances
these classes will be the best filled of
any.
One of the features of the show will be
a pack of foxhounds owned by Mr. Wick
ert. They will be exhibited in a separate
pen, which will be handsomely decorated
with many trophies of the chase.
Philip- C. Meyer intends to have a try
for the San Francisco Kennel Club's sil
ver cup for the best kennel of St. Ber
nards and for the Dr. Cluness cup for the
same. Mr. Mejter intends to enter five
dogs in his kennel, among which will' be
the great Alta Rachel, St. Leonard-Prin
cess Rachel.
The rivalry among the fox terrier men
is keen. When one member of the Pa
cific Fox Terrier Club buys a good dog

Aldon Swagger from the Rev. J. \V. Plln

GOLFERS ON MANY LINKS.
Though playing on their opponents'
course and five down on the first round,
the San Francisco eightâ or rather seven,
for H. D. Pillsbury was absentâ defeated
the Oakland Golf Club representatives
seven up in the first half of the second
home-and-home tournament, which took
place on the Adams Point links last Sat
urday. For the home team E. R. Folger
played the strongest game, being only two
down against John Lawson over eighteen
holes. The San Francisco golfers, both
men and women, have now won five
matches straight from the Oaklanders,
three on the Oakland links and two over
the Presidio course.
The second half of the contest will take
place this afternoon, the representatives,
of both clubs being much the same as on
last Saturday. H. D. Pillsbury will be on
hand to play for the San Francisco team.
He is in good form. It is probable that
the San Francisco men, playing on their
own links, will Increase their lead over
the Oaklanders, who rarely show them
selves at their best over the Presidio
course.
The proposed match between the golfers
of the University of California and of
Stanf&rd University has not yet been ar
ranged.
The course laid out by Stephenson at
Reid's School, Belm.ont. is being played
upon, and as soon as a good team can be
got together a match against the boys at
St. Matthew's School, San Mateo, will be
arranged.
George Smith, the newly engaged pro
fessional of the San Rafael Golf. Club, ar
rived here early this week, but was pre
vented by the rain from getting out on
the links until Thursday, on which day
he went round twice with R. Gllman
Brown. Smith plays an easy game and
his approaching Is particularly fine. In
two rounds he missed only once laying
his ball right on the green close up to the
hole. He played the best game ever seen
on the San Rafael course.
COLLEGE BOYS
MEET AGAIN ON
THE DIAMOND
University of California and
Stanford Play To-Day at
Palo Alto.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, April 13.â
Since last Saturday's defeat In baseball
on the Berkeley field every effort has bÂ«en
made to put the men into winning form.
Each afternoon a practice game with the
second team Is played, when Coach
Murphy and Captain Strohm do all In
their power to rouse the team to a win
ning pace before it is too late. All are
agreed that the trouble Is the men can
not handle the ball either In the Infield
or outfield. However, their stick work
and base running remain good and they
may be able to win next Saturday's game
upon this score, together with the advan
tage which comes from -playing: on their
own grounds. It is likely that Cowden's
place at second will be filled by Brown,
as the former haa been confined to his bea
during the week. It is possible that other
changes will be made, but they will not bÂ»Â»
announced till Saturday.
The candidates on the field and track
are doing conscientious training for their
Events. The men are divided Into squads,
according to their events, so . that the
trainers can give them more individual
attention. The freshmen are much en
couraged by their victory over Nevada
University, and their, entire team remains
In the list for the big field day.
Active preparations are L><4>n;r. made to
handle the crowds that will visit thÂ«
Stanford campus to see the second Inter
collegiate baseball game and the field day.
The diamond has been put into excellent
shape, while seating capacity for 2000 per
sons has been provided. Manager Cant
well has also improved the track and Is
erecting bleachers for 2300 people.
The try-out tournament to choose Stan
ford's representatives In Intercollegiate
tennis will be held on the Endna courts
Saturday morning. Sam Hardy and Harry
Welhe, Stanford's two- best players, are
known among the tennis cracks of the
coast and should bring the championship
to Stanford. The intercollegiate match
will be held on the courts of the California
Tennis Club In San Francisco at 9 a, ra.
April 21. The matches will be two best
out of three, instead of three out of five
as formerly.

RICH STAKES
ARE OFFERED
COURSING MEN
The Reported Scarcity of
Hares Does Not Hamper
the Sport.
The reported scarcity of hares has ap
parently not alarmed the management of
Union Coursing Park. Two stakes, with
a total entry of 140 greyhounds, form the
card for to-day and to-morrow. The
champion stake will be decided to-morrow
afternoon. The reserve stake will be run
down once and possibly twice to-day,
commencing upon the arrival of the 10:15
a. m. train. The Tanforan train leaving
here at 1:25 p. m. will also stop at the
park. The champion stake has attracted
i^uxor. Warship, Bad Boy, Crawford Lad,
Flying Fox, Brutus, Narcissus, White
head,-Palo Alto and Theron. The reserve
stake, with its 128 entries, has many dogs
of high class.
The change made by the management
of Ingleaide Park in offering special
stakes frequently has proved a popular
move. In all big open stakes there are
usually about eight dogs that outclass
the remainder of those entered. By giving
special stakes these dogs compete one
against another and .provide sensational
sport, every course being a match. With
the champions out of the way the open
stake also develops good sport, these dogs
also being well matched. It also affords
them an opportunity to earn their train
ing expenses.
The special stake to-morrow Includes:
Flora McDonald, Connemara, Master
Clair, Chicago Boy, Pepita, Tea Rose,
St. Oran and Golden Rule. The open
stake, the first round of which will be run
to-day, commencing at 1 p. m., was lim
ited to sixty-four entries.
M. Dunlea has lost by death his prom
ising young greyhound Fenian Boy. He
was a brother of Palo Alto, Ireland,
American and other great performers.
D. J. Healey of Petaluma has been un
fortunate with his greyhounds during the
past week. Sisquoc, his crack dog, was
being given an "opening up" run when
he started a hare which made its escape
through a picket fence. Sisquoc dashed
after him, but could only get half way
through. He wrenched himself badly and
will not be able to start for some time.
Mr. Healey was also unfortunate In losing
the entire litter of Emm Pasha-Wave
puppies. Much was expected of these,
as the first litter proved a great one.
James Dean has lost by distemper two
of his promising puppies by his great
black dog Connemara, out of Mialmo.
They were over a year old and much was
expected of them.
J. J. Edmonds has some puppies â¢by
Young America-Valley Queen and by
Master Glenkirk-Vlda Shaw, which will
be soon running for him on the local
coursing fields.
Captain P. M. Clarkson's promising
puppies, Flower of Gold and Golden
Garter, were badly cut by barbed wire
some days ago. Sterl & Knowles' Sleety
j Mist is also on the shelf from the same
cause. O'Hara followed her through a
fence, taking the dangerous wire- with
him, without sustaining a scratch. .
Aeneid Kennels' Van Doric died after
whelping some days since.
C. E. Root, a Minnesota coursing man,
has sent a nineteen-months-old greyhound
to be bred to J. O Shea's YoUng America,
Mr. Chambille has secured one of the
same, litter, which he will start on the
local coursing fields. They are of the
same litter as J. R. Smith's Master Dav
enport and Lady Sears.
Curtis &. Sons have purchased Old Glory
from M. Michalek. Old Glory ran Vulcan,
one of the Curtis cracks, to a head at
Union Park last Sunday, and It was the
favor of the hare which gave the course
to Vulcan.
H. A. Deckelman has sold Prince George
to David Dillon. The dog is by St. Law
rence-Buenretiro, nnd la of the same Utter
as Lottie M and Wild Tralee. He will be
coursed for a time and then retired to the
stud.
J. Lenlhan's Rosalie has whelped a litter
of eleven puppies, of which seven are
dogs, to Bernal Boy. The sire Is by Emm
Pasha and the dam by St. Clair. T. J.
McHugh has secured a black and white
dog puppy with a distinct star on the
head, which Is most promising.
Hopkins will show Lola Montez, a litter
sister to Hebe Montez, and W. E. Meek
will place on the bench his unbeaten dog
California Cube (Cube-Pedigree).
A. G. Glenn, the member recently elect
ed to the Mastiff Club, will compete for
the prizes with a dark horse, a mastiff
bitch by Timothy, out of Minerva.
Pet dogs are undoubtedly going to be a
great feature of the show. Mrs. Deane
will have her kennel of beautiful Italian
greyhounds on exhibition and Mrs. Grace
will show her silky haired Yorkshire ter
riers. Mrs. W. H. Crocker will show poo
dles, both corded and curly. Mrs. Henry
J. Crocker has some handsome specimens
of the toy Pomeranian and Mrs. PHls
bury and Mrs. Norman will compete for
the Flood cup for Boston terriers. There
will be quite an exhibit of the breed this
year and neither the Lemmer cup nor the
Kennel Club's cup will be won without
hot competition, in which Mrs. Carlton
with her Oakslde Tremont will have a
good chance, of winning out.
The show will open May 2.
WIND MARS THE
SPORT OF MANY
FLY-CASTERS
Men Who Want Big Fish Await
the Opening of Mountain
Streams.
The fishermen have had their first try at
the trout in nearby streams and have, in
a degree, satisfied their longing for a
day's outing with rod/and line. They
have now settled down to planning other
and longer outings when the important
streams arid lakes of the high Sierras,
now snowbound, will be opened to them.
The heavy north wind of last Saturday
precluded the possibility of casting a fly
in any of the nearby streams. The rain
and other adverse conditions had a de
pressing effect upon the fish and few were
taken. . Conditions are not much better
this week and a comparatively small num
ber of anglers have planned trips afield.
From Verdi comes information of flur
ries of snow and also that the fish are not
running nor jumping at any of the dams
on the river. The same reports come
from the Klamath, where the weather has
been extremely cold. Snow and rain have
combined to destroy the sport for the time
being, but later on it will be all that can
be desired.
Colonel Kelihor is still at Balrds, on
the McCloud, and is apparently success
ful, as he sent a splendid basket of lish
to Henry Skinner on Thursday. W. F.
Bogart and his friend, Mr. Emmons, went
to the McCloud on Thursday of lact week.
They found the river high and a cold
north wind also tended to spoil their sport.
Despite these drawbacks they were fair
ly successful, securing some handsome
flsh. Colonel Kelihor has so worked upon
some of his friends in Austin, Tex.,
that a number of them have signified their
intention of spending a month on the trout
streams of this State when the season is
at its height.
Frank Maskey has returned from his
lodge on Eel River, where he enjoyed good
sport on the opening of the season with Ai
Hall.
Fishing on the Paper Mill has been good
during the week. The majority of those
who lish the stream use ordinary bait,
Ignoring the more aristocratic and highly
colored fly.
John Butler is organizing a small party
to flsh the lagoon at San Gregorio for
steelheads. The ordinance recently passed
by the Supervisors of San Mateo County,
closing the streams until May 1, does not
prevent fishing in tidewater. This per
mits fishing at the mouth of the Pesca
dero and the San Gregorio. The most
popular lure is a small frog, which the
steelheads take with aviaity.
John Gallagher and Charles Green came
down from Russian River on Wednesday
night. They report many striped bass in
the river and these provided good sport
for the anglers.
Messrs. Eagleson and Robinson caught
ninety pounds of rockcod at Point Blunt,
Angel I'Xind, last Sunday. The fishing
there j*s been of good quality and has
attrairid many anglers to that vicinity.
The regular semi-monthly contests of
the San Francisco Fly-Casting Club will
be held this afternoon and to-morrow
morning on Stow Lake. As. few of the
members have planned fishing trips for
this week a large attendance is expected.
The striped bass enthusiasts tried for
their favorite game fish in the Oakland
estuary and also in San Leandro Bay,
but were unsuccessful.
CAPITAL CITY
GETS HUGHES
TO STAY HERE
Needs the Crack Brooklyn
Pitcher to Strengthen Its
Baseball Team.
The Sacramento ball cranks are alarmed
over the failure of their team to win a
majority of the games played up to date
this season. There was always a keen
rivalry between Sacramento and Stockton
In baseball matters, and the Capital City
fans have already acquired a wholesome
respect for George Harper's Slough City
aggrgeatlon. They feel they can stand
him off now that they have signed
Hughes. The latter will accompany the
team to this city this week. The question
regarding the ability of Sacramento to
hold him was settled yesterday. Spencer,
the crack shortstop of the Southern
League, has not yet Joined the team,
and Manager Harris feels that it
behooves him to get another player. The
probability is that he will sign Decker,
the heavy-hitting first baseman of the
Chieagos. and shift McCarthy to short.
He is well satisfied with the team in other
respects and is confident it will be in the
race from start to finish. As the cham
pions have not been seen on the local dia

RULING WHICH
COST THE TURF
A SPORTSMAN
Prince Poniatowski Retires
From Racingâ Corrigan May
Be Snubbed in England.
The disqualification of Sardonic at Tan
foran Park on Tuesday last was the oc
casion for a regular hallelujah praise
meeting on the part of the Corriganites.
This action on the part of the Judges was
lauded to the skies as Illustrating con
clusively that Corrlgan had no more of a
"drag" at the San Mateo course than any
othtr horse owner. The comparison be
tween the Sardonic and Ella Boland rul
ings is about as strikingly similar as a
band wagon and a hearse would seem to
a blind man. When Sardonic was set back
and the race given to Tappan it was for
a palpable foul, committed in plain view
of everybody. At the same time the odds
against the mare had receded in the bet
ting, and the b<*)ks were the severest
sufferers. When Ella Boland was set
back and the race given to Corrigan's
St. Casimir it was for an alleged breach
of etiquette, perfectly indescernible to
the spectator. Furthermore, nine of every
ten racegoers present on that day are
still willing to wager that no foul was
committed by the rider of Ella Boland. St.
Casimir had been plunged on, while the
filly which raced the faint-hearted "dog"
to a standstill was almost overlooked by
the average player.
There is one thing the disqualifying of
Ella Boland did accomplish. In abhor
rence of and in disgust at "Corrigan fair
play," Prince Poniatowski, owner of the
rilly, has quit the sport. The firm of
.Burns & Waterhouse purchased Ella Bo
land and Mortgage, and in future the
type the American turf is most in need
of will devote his energies to the breed
ing Industry.
When Barney Schreiber's crack piece
of racing bric-a-brac, Sofala, started for
the Gebhard it was with many misgiv
ings on the part of Felix Carr and Dick
Williams, Barney's two trainers. Felix
had a dread of the "hoodoo" thirteenth
6tart. while Dick said Schrelber ought to
be arrested for starting a young two-year
old with all that weight up. Barney him
self was like a nervous "scrapper" wait
ing for the gong. He finally consulted
Judge Joe Murphy, who probably told the
St. lx)Uis man she would strike Just as
hard game in an ordinary purse race. If
it didn't help her it certainly did not hurt
the filly's selling price any.
Jockey Joe Piggott still lingers in town,
but will not ride at Tanforan. Joe says
he is always doing his best and objects to
being called into the stand after each
race to explain some trifling happening.
Tanforan Park still keeps up its record
for killing odds-on favorites. Fortunately
the track is located in close proximity to
the cemeteries and In after years inquir
ing members of the talent can drop down
that way and read what happened to some
of their coin.
It is more than probable that Jim Cald
well will do the starting at Denver in
June next. The "Prince's" work has been
excellent the past season and if not af
flicted with that Incurable disease attack-
Ing all flag-wielders, "searching for ad
verse press notices." would be one of the
good fellows of the turf.
While Eastern turf writers are telling
what Corrigan is going to do in and about
Chicago this summer the deposed ruler
of veiled Ingleside is kept busy at this
end telling of his English turf campaign
As yet the English turf writers have had
little to say. In passing opinion on a
horse the men of the press on the other
side usually go over the animal carefully
looking for blemishes before expressing
any views. Perhaps when the action of
the Jockey Club, the representative turf
body of this country, and of the Califor
nia Jockey Club, the former in refusing
Corrigan a trainer's license, the latter in
rejecting his stake entries, becomes known
there may be a bombardment.

YACHT CLUB TO
OPEN SEASON
Commodore Hanley of the En

of Sailincr Events.
The oldest yacht club on San Francisco
Bay will to-day open the season of 19J0.
Most of the yachts are in commission, and
several have already been under sail.
Last Sunday Commodore J. D. Spreckels
took a party of friends out on his fine
schooner Lurline, which has abandoned
her suit of black with a gold line, and Is
now pure white. Ex-Commodore T. L.
Hill was out in the sloop Cygnus, and,
Commodore \V. X. McCarihv in the flag

Simpklns has been, absent from the city,
but has returned to his quarters at the
University Club. His fine yawl Tramon
tana is on the ways at Tiburon. having
ii new keelson put in forward and being
eenerally braced and strengthened. The
molds for the angle-iron braces are ready
and it is hoped that she can be put into a
thoroughly stanch, water-tight condition.
The schooner Aggie will be taken out at
Benicia. on Matthew Turner's ways. A
craft that will be much missed from the
San Francisco fleet Is K. C. Bartlett's
yawl Frolic, which for many years has
been one of the best-known yachts on the
bay.

t-chooner Virginia.
This afternoon the yachts will lie at
their moorings in front of the clubhouse.
They will have every available piece of
bunting flying and will be ready to re
ceive visitors on board. During the after
noon several yachtsmen will cruise over
from Tiburon and Oakland Creek and will
take part in the dance in the clubhouse
In the evening. All the directors will act
as stewards at the dance, which will go
on until midnight. The last boat returns
to the city at 10:50 p. m.
Commodore J. S. Hanley of the Encinal
Tacht Club has issued a programme of
sailing events for the season, which 31-111
oj>en May 12. Visitors from other yacht
clubs will be received in the afternoon,
and in the evening there will be a variety
show and a dance. Next day the visiting
yachts will be escorted to the chanr.el.
On May 25 there will be a cruise to the
naval train! rig etation on Goat Island.
On June <> there will be a cruise to San
Mateo.
The South Bay Tacht Club has issued
Its programme for the season, which will
be opened on Sunday, April 22, at the
Drawbridge. On Saturday and Sunday,
April 2S and Zj, there will be an over
night cruise to Dumbarton Point. The
programme includes half a dozen over
night cruises, a visit to the Pacific Inter
club Yacht Association regatta at San
Francisco and a race for the Martin Doerr
cup. â¢ â¢
OITE wwk from to-day the sprinters and Jumpers of the rival universities at Berkeley and Palo Alto will meet in the- annual intercollegiate
championships. These will be held on the Stanford field, in keeping with the intention to have all contests tako place at the colleges, thus
in a measure dointr away with the grate money, which it was thought lowered the standard of amateurism, especially where so large a sum of
money was Involved as is usually taken at an intercollegiate football match. University of California will present next Saturday the men who will
fly its colors in May at Mott Haven and other Eastern college fields. The sharpest competition will possibly be between Captain Hotf! Boyd
of Stanford and Jack Hoffman. University of California, In the pole vault and high Jump. Both are doing better than record In practice and
only the test of competition can determine which is the better man. The teams are believed to be evenly matched in the majority of the events.
A feature of the day will be a match between Bakewell of. University of California and Thompson' of Academic League.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL- 14, 1900.
4THE Monumental gate, the principal entrance to the grounds, stands on the Cours de la Reine,
about 166 yards from the statue cf the Place de la Concorde. It is preceded by two grand ar-
Pstic rr.a*t.-. brilliantly ornamented and surmounted by electric lights. Though modestly
classed on the official plan as "gate number 13," it is certainly one of the features of the expo
sition, as nuch 60 by its imposing dimensions as by the splendor of Its decorations.
PARIS. April 13.â The exposition
authorities are making a strenuous
effort to prepare the show for the
inauguration to-morrow, but an cx
arr.ir.alion of the grounds and build
ings* tu-<iay shows the task is im
possible. The buildings are filled with de
bris and the exhibits are only partially in-
Fta'.;Â» d. The Salle dcs Fetes, In which the
inaugural ceremonies are planned to oc
cur to-morrow, has an army of men ciear
ing the- floor t-pace .and arranging the
mats. The work will continue all night
end dose to the hour when the invited
guests arrive.
In order to facilitate the labor of clear
ing the grounds thousands of soldiers have
been utilized.
The ceremonies are timed to begin at 2
o'clock, when M. MiUerand. Minister of
Commerce, will make the inaugural ad
dress, to which President Loubet will re
ply. The President will then walk
through a portion of the grounds and aft
erward, embarking on a river craft he
will go down the Kivcr 'Seine to the new
Alexander 111 bridge, which he will
formally declare open. The exposition
grounds will he closed for the remainder
of the day. the formal opening to the pub
lic taking place on Sunday.
The whole exposition space is covered
by fiickering lights and hordes of work
men are busily engaged in clearing away ;
scaffoldings, packing and debris of every |
kind, which still litter all the arteries of
the exposition. This work Is only to pre- ]
pare a series of tableaus for the President
to-morrow, as he will not enter the expo
sition buildings proper, but will only in
spect the diftercnt edifices from the out
f ,%. for the excellent reason that the
buildings are thus far mere shells, with
scarcely any exhibits to be seen anywhere.
â¢ A ii < \ r , M - Loubet's visit to-morrow these
(scaffoldings will be rebuilt and the inter
rupted work of Installation will be re
sumed.
The success of the inauguration ceremo
ny will depend largely upon the weather
to-morrow, which happily promises to be
..*;â¢ r. Otne rwise the exposition grounds
will become a veritable slough of despon
dency.
Despite the incomplete condition of the
exposition President Loubet will be able
to enjoy three splendid views. The first
is the view down the Champs de Mars
â¢from the Trocadero to the Chateau d'Eu.
with artistic palaces on either side and
with the center bestrode by the Immense
arches of the Eiffel tower.
The second is the vista from the Champs
Elysees across the new Alexander bridge
to the Hotel dcs Invalides. with the gild
ed dome of the tomb of Napoleon 1 rising
up at the farther end and flanked firstly
by an avenue of trees and then by white
facades of handsome edifices. In which
will be collected the exhibits classed un
der the varied industries, these facades
being embellished by groups of sculpture
and by huge and effective paintings of al
legorical subjects.
The third prospect is the. scene looking
along the Seine embankment, upon which
are erected the national pavilions of the
foreign nations, each of which is a re
production of some famous building typi
fying the national architecture of the
country it represents. The bright colors
The whole is inclosed by an ornamental
fmlisade painted green and decorated at
ntervals with trellis work, on which are
trained climbing vines and creepers, giv
ing a most pleasing effect to the eye.
Thirty-six gates in aJI give entrance tiÂ»
the grounds, so situated* and of such size
as to give convenient and ready passage
to the vast crowds of people that will
come from every quarter of the city at tht>
nearest point of approach.
Within the Grounds. '
Looking at any map of Paris or plan of
the grounds it is easy to form an Idea of
the situation and importance of the vari
ous parts of the exposition, which is di
vided by the topography of the grounds
into a number of sections more or less in
dependent of each other, yet intimately
connected with the general plan and with
one another.
Thus the two palaces of the Champs
Elysees, the Petit Palais, devoted to
French art alone from its origin to the
present time, and the Grand Palais, de
voted to the fine arts generally, form a
homogeneous whole, distinct from the rest
of the exposition. Across the Seine, yet
closely connected by the Pont Alexandre
111. the Esplanade dcs Invalides, with its
palaces of "divers industries." and of the
"decoration and furnishing of public
buildings and habitations," forms another
not less autonomous.
The Rue dcs Nationsâ that is to say. the
double line of palaces of foreign powers
âwhich stretches along the left bank of
the Seine, between the Pont dcs Invalides
and >the Pont de l'Alma. presents likewise
a peculiar; physiognomy and finds itself
localized in a distinct zone with the palace
of "Armies and Navies" and the palace oC
Hygiene. The individuality of the
Champs Elysees. Mars with its palaces
of industrial arts, mining, electricity,
agriculture, and the Eiffel Tower, is incon
testable, and that of the Trocadero. with
its French and foreign colonial exhibits.
Is not less so. Finally along the right bank
of the Seine from the Trocadero to the
Pont dcs In\-alldes stretches an elongated
zone parallel to that on the other bank,
not less independent. Here are the palaces
of the City of Paris, of Social Economy
and Congresses of the Dance of Mirth,
Song, Liviner Tableaux, aquariums, res
taurants. ol<i Paris and many other
things. This fragmentary disposition en
ables one to comprehend the Immensity
of the exposition much better than if It
was concentrated in one vast, regular
block. One can go through the whole
without missinK any essential in a more
enjoyable manner. The crowds will btÂ»
more evenly distributed, circulation will
be easier and congestions will be avoided.
The Intercommunication.
Perfect unity of and easy passage be
tween the several .sections lying oh oppo
site sides of the Seine for some 2500 yards
is assured by four permanent bridges and
four "passarelles." temporary structures
for foot passengers. For thia purpose the
Pont Alexandre 111, a monumental work
of most prominent character, was con
structed. It lies in the axis of the Es
planade dcs Invalid** am' the broa>i ave
nue between the Petit Palais and the
Grand Palais on the Champs Elysees. Be
low it come in order the Pont dcs Inva-
Hdes. the Pont de TAlma and the Pont
de Jena, which latter has been consider
ably widened.
TMtUNITErbSTATK BUILDING,
M9MUMETITAL GATE - PRINCIPAL ENTRANCE:.
THE United States building stands on the Qual d'Orsay, on the Seine, In the Rue dcs Nations. It
' has a frontage of eighty-five feet and a depth of ninety feet, and the top of the dome is 160
feet above the ground. The main feature is the classic porch, which opens on the Seine. The
cost of the building itself, aside from the furnishings, will be something over J220.000. It stands
between the Ottoman pavilion and that of the Austro-Hungarian empire.
TKÂ£ CALIFORNIA CQ/AmSSIQtiE-RS.t
THE Exposition authorities themselves do not know
what will be the most popular and striking feature of
the" Exposition, but- it will^doubtless prove to be one
of the following, all of them novel and attractive:
1. The street "of modern Paris, running along the em
bankment from the Place de la Concorde to the Pont de
I'Alma. This will illustrate the art and wit, of France, and
will contain palaces of dancing, song, and all that is refined
in the- curiosities of Paris. The directors of the Opera and
another leading Paris theater are engaged upon its elab
oration.
2. M. Deloncle's telescope, bringing the moon's sur
face apparently within forty kilometres (twenty-five miles)
of the spectator.
3. A city of gold, near the Trocadero, showing every
detail of gold production, with Californian miners and
models of the mines.
4. A gigantic turning palace, or revolving tower, 100
yards high and lighted throughout by electricity.
5. The grand and little palaces of the fine arts of all
nations.
6. The pavilion of the press, and those of the special
commissioners, which will be scattered over the area.
7. An enormous terrestrial globe by the famous
French geographer, M. Reclus, placed, owing to its size,
outside the Exposition proper.
8. Palace of the army and navy, and a palace of food,
â¢ In addition "to these there will almost certainly be a
Woman's Palace, showing the development of fem
inine education, training and labor; a switchback; a colos
sal vat; an enormous bell; imitation of the â¢ Blue Grotto of
Capri, of the fountain of Vaucluse; captive balloons; a cy
cloramaof the war of secession in America, and other de
vices to interest, charm or amuse.
Loubet Will Press the Button.
The "Exposition Universelle Interna
tionale de Paris" will be officially inaugu
rated to-day at 6 a. m.. San Francisco
time. The ceremony will take place In
the immense Salle dcs Fetes of the Champ
de Mars, which occupies the center of the
former machinery building of the exposi
tion of ISB3. President Loubet will press
an electric button and the great exposi
tion of 1900 will be launched.
To-morrow, Easter Sunday, the gates
will be thrown open to the public. -Â¦
This grand manifestation, a worthy, cor
onation of the cioslng century, easily sur
passes in splendcr all of those which have
preceded it. It is the result of a colossal
sum of Ideas, of which the best have been
preserved by a series of happy selections
and realized by six years of material ef
forts. These efforts have brought into
existence a veritable new city.formlng an
agglomeration, distinctly separate- and
apart, in the midst of the grand capital
1889, but its official existence dates from
July, 1592, when. the subject was brought
before President Carnot by M. Jules
Roche, then Minister of Public Works.
On July 13 following President Carnot Is
sued a decree announcing "a universal ex
position of works of art and of Industrial
and agricultural products." The date was
fixed at May 15 to October 31, 1900, but
subsequently changed to April 15 to No
vember 15. 1900. Preliminary studies were
made, a financial scheme devised and an
administration instituted.
Generally speaking, the exposition, as
has been all the preliminary work, is un
der the control of the Minister of Com
merce and Industry, though the working
head has been and is now M. Alfred
Picard. commissioner general, assisted by
Secretary General Henri Chardon. Direct
or General of Exploitation M. Delaunay-
Bellevllle and six other directors of the
various sections of the work.
Extent of the Big Enterprise.
The actual land area within the in
closure of the exposition of 11XX) is consid
erably greater than that of 18S9, being
about 268 acres, of which 72^ acres are
covered by buildings. The site occupied
includes the public grounds on both sides
of the Seine from the Place de la Concorde
to the Pont de l'Alma, which area includes
the Champ de Mars, the Trocadero, the
Qual d'Orsay, the Esplanade dcs Inva
lides, the Quai de la Conference, the Cours
de la Relne and that part of the Champs
Elysees on which until recently stood the

of France, with its own inclosure, its
gates, its special administration â all the
complicated services of an autonomous
city. : . ,
It is, indeed, a marvelous city: a city of
a dream, uniquely composed of magnifi
cent palaces rising on .all sides alortg tri
umphal ways, avenues set with trees, gar
dens designed with art and kept up with
minutest care. ' .
Monuments to Modern Skill.
Everywhere are superb. perspectives un
ceasingly' raised, all the people In- the
â¢world haying- co-operated in the common
work and to it brought their skill, .their
taste and their typical architecture. It
Is the entire world in summary. It is also
the resume of the history of an age of
civilization.
All the years of the closing century, all
the countries of the world, have adorned
these palaces and filled them with the
most perfect productions of their arts and
sciences, of the innumerable branches of
human activity.- And from all parts of
the world gather the multitudes who-peo
ple this glorious city.
Though It will vanish like abeautlful
dream at the end of six months, the expo
sition of 1900 will be the consecration of a
date in the Industrial history of the world.
The exposition of 1900 is the fifth of the
series of grand expositions that have been
held In the "city of great devices." The
first was in'lBss. the next in 1867, the* third
in IS7B and the fourth, commemorating the
centenary of French Independence, in 18S9.

"coctail" and "ron" on their lists of alcoholic drinks.

by that name is sold for 10 cents a quart. The island

The efforts to get up something like excitement
over the choice of candidates for the Vice Presidency
of the ttvo parties have failed utterly. The people
appear willing to leave the matter to the politicians.
So long as the popular voice names the head of the
ticket no one cares much who names the tail.
The defect in the Dewey Presidential boom is that
he waited too long. Had he been as slow in war as
in politics he never would have made enough of a
reputation to be mentioned as a Presidential, possi

FOR HEALTH SAKE.
ACCORDING to the report of a correspondent
of the Boston Globe a good many Germans
have come to the conclusion that South Africa
is this year the most attractive health resort on the
face of the earth. The correspondent is himself on
the way to the seat of war, having taken passage upon
a German steamer. In a letter dated "Off Lisbon,
March 20," he says: "On this German boat going to
South Africa we have about 400, almost all men. It
is a most unique crowd. Three German Barons are
in the steerage, with many students bearing the scars
of duels, and military looking men who sign them
selves as 'mechanics. 1 These latter have mustaches as
fierce and bristling as Kaiser Wilhelm's. Most of
our shipfolks are going to South Africa solely 'for
their health.' There are about fifty Red Cross nurses
and doctors on board. Then we have many Outland
ers returning to the Transvaal with passports from
their respective countries. They are all strongly pro-
Boer."
It is significant that^the Outlanders of other nation
alities have none of the complaints to make of which
the British Outlander population has been so profuse.
Thus the correspondent quotes his fellow passengers
of that kind as saying: "Wages in the Transvaal un
der President Kruger's administration were $5 to 6 a
day, as against $2 50 to $3 under British rule in Kim
berley. This low rate in Kimberley was owing to
the De Beers .monopoly. At Kimberley the men had
to buy from the company everything they needeo.
This is called the compound system. They were also
forced to board in the company's boarding-houses.
In the Transvaal they bought where they liked and
boarded where they liked. Board at the Rand was
$30 per month when men were earning $125 to $150
per month."
It is doubtless true that many of these "health-

AN AUTOMOBILE PROJECT.
SOME years ago the promoters 01 the "good
roads" agitation brought forward rhe project
of constructing a broad highway across the
continent, from the Atlantic to the Pacific. The sug
gestion was so favorably received that a United States
Commission, with General Miles as chairman, was ap
pointed to investigate its feasibility and report upon
it. No official report has yet been made, but the
General is quoted as having stated to the Automobile
Club of New York that the highway would be com
pleted within five years.
There is doubtless some error in the report, for
General Miles could not have promised the comple
tion of the road in that time. His commission, in
fact, may account itself lucky if within that number
of years it obtain an appropriation for beginning the
work. The significance of the report lies in the reve
lation it makes of the warm interest the General takes
in the project and his sanguine assurance of, its prac
ticability and its usefulness. (
The automobile, like the bicycle, has roused a
strong body of progressive men to take part, in the
efforts to improve our highways. To the automobile,
in fact, a good road is even more imperative than to
the wheel, for it can make no satisfactory progress at
all over bad roads. Consequently those interested in
the new vehicle have taken up the agitation for im
proved highways and are carrying it forward upon a
larger scale than the bicycle men dreamed of. They
seek not only a highway across the continent from
east to west, but one north to south, from Maine
to Florida, andihave begun a campaign of education
on the subject. ;*" â¢ '
According to the reports that come to us the plans
of -the club are. that one-third of the cost of construct
ing the highways shall be paid by. the National Gov
ernrnent, one-third by the States through which they
pass, and the remaining third by cities, towns and
counties lying along them. The >plan is not so ex
travagant as appears at first thought. It is not like
projecting a highway three thousand miles through
a wild country. Along considerable stretches of the
proposed route' fairly good roads are in existence and
comparatively little work would be needed to put
them in the required condition. The division of the
cost would, moreover, make the -burden 1 light along
the whole line. The benefits. to be derived by the
communities through which" the highways pass would
be great, and it , is therefore likely that when once
fairly launched the enterprise would be cordially, taken
no from one side the continent to the other

time is that of Lord Kitchener. A little while ago he

seeking" young Germans are going to war merely for
the sake of adventure, but most of them represent the
earnest sympathy of the German people for the Boers
in their sturdy fight against British aggression. Theirs

the Duke of York's baby named Patrick, Queen Vic

similar to the Coldstream and Scots guards, and as
the officers of the corps will of course have high rank

RUSSIAN DIPLOMACY.
WHILE reports continue to come in of Russian
aggressions all along the lines of her wide em
pire, from Asia Minor to Korea, her diploma
tists b!ar.d!y but emphatically deny the commission
of such aggressions or the existence of any desire on
the part of the Russian Government to commit them.
The rumors of efforts made to obtain domination in
Korea have been, it seem*, especially painful to Rus
sian sensibilities, and Count Cassini, the Czar's Em
bassador at Washington, has recently informed the
correspondent of the New York Herald that his
"communications directly from Tokio, respecting the
feeling in Japan, are entirely at variance with those
published in the press reports. Russia is scrupulously
observing the terms of the agreement made with the
Japanese Government in relation to Korea, and has
no intention of precipitating war."
Where there is so much smoke there is bound to
be some fire. Few people will believe, even upon the
word of a Russian Embassador, that the multitude of
reports of Russian military movements in Korea
formed of themselves in the air without any why or
wherefore. Some reason must be assigned for them,
and accordingly it has been suggested that all of
these rumors "have been invented by persons friendly
to the British and circulated by them for the purpose
01 distracting attention from South Africa."
The suggestion is ingenious, but it hardly accounts
for all the facts in the case. The claims made upon
Turkey . for railway concessions, the loan made to
Persia upon terms that give Russia a virtual domina
tion in that country, are matters about which there
can be no dispute, for such demands and actions
could not be concealed. Aggression in one quarter
L. pretty good evidence of a willingness to commit
aggression elsewhere if it could be done with safety,
and accordingly it will take something more than
Count Cassini's communications, from Tokio to con
vince the world that Russia is scrupulously observing
her agreement with Japan concerning Korea and has
no intention to violate it.
In the meantime the Czar's peace party seems to
have fallen into obscurity at St. Petersburg and the
war parry is dominant. Thus the Sviet, the organ of
the ''Forward" party, as they call themselves, is
quoted as having recently said: "The settling of Eng
lish subjects in Beloochistan and Southern Persia
only serves as an indication of the supreme shame
lcsfness of the English nation, which desires to ap
propriate everything to itself. . . . The territory
south of Russia, right down to the Persian Gulf and
the Indian Ocean, between the longitude of Batoum
and Samarkand, is a sphere of influence indubitably
Russian. Neither the English nor the Germans can
in any circumstances be permitted entrance into this
repion. . . . The expulsion of the English who
ire attempting to root themselves in Beloochistan
and Southern Persia is imperative."
So the Russian press cries "Forward," and all re
ports from Asia Minor, Persia and Korea are to the
Â«iTcct that the cry is finding expression in action.
Diplomacy mcy deny things which all the world can
see. for th2t is a part of the trade, but the denial h
not 'likely" to have much effect. Nations that have any
interests at stake in Syria, Persia, China or Korsa
?re not going to ignore what is doing in Asia for the
sake of watching what is going on in South Africa.

RACING REVENUES IN NEW YORK.
AUGUST BELMONT, Edwin D. Morgan and
John Sandford, State Racing Commissioners
of New York, have just submitted to the Leg
islature a report making a very interesting showing of
the extent to which racing is carried on in that State
and the revenues which it yields.
The State imposes a tax of 5 per cent upon the gross
receipts of racing associations for the benefit of agri
cultural societies, and the report says: "In the five
years over which the term of the commission extends
there has been paid in to -the State Controller for dis
tribution among the agricultural societies the sum of
$3HÂ»i39 04- A review of this tax by years will illus
trate the progress of racing in this State. In 1895 the
tax was $25,220 74. This was* the first year of the new
order. The racing, associations were somewhat
doubtful of its practicability, and the public had to be
educated to see that this new order did not destroy
racing, but simply transferred it to a surer basis. . Six
associations held licenses that year. In 1896 the tax
was $50,608 10, and in that year only five associations
held meetings. A license had been issued to the Sara
toga Association, but because of local reasons it did
not take advantage of it, although it has conducted
meetings annually since. In 1897 the tax was
$64,034 64, and in 1898 it was $80,483 85, and in 1899
it was $90,791 71, making a grand total of $311,139 04.
This represents aggregate gross receipts of $6,222,
780 80, or an average, annual total gross receipt of
$1,244,556 16."
The Commissioners say: "It would be vain to hope
for any such increase in ratio of receipts for the suc
ceeding five years, but there is every reason to expect
the present popular interest in the sport will continue
to such an extent at least as will make the revenues of
1899 not an extravagant standard."
These revenues, it is to be borne in mind, are drawn
from legitimate racing, and do not include the
amounts of illegitimate profits and winnings made by
track gamblers, who carry on racing solely for the
purpose of gambling. The public can therefore form
some conception of the immense drain which track
gamblers make upon the income of a community.
For the expenses of legitimate racing the community
derives a compensating benefit in the improvement
of horses and the encouragement of breeding good
stock, but from the illegitimate racing there is de
rived nothing but ruin, crime and suicide.
In stating the effects of legitimate racing in pro
ducing enlarged and more profitable markets for the
breeders and wider opportunities for the owners of
good horses, the report says: "In 1895 and in 1596,
which might be termed the experimental years of the
new order, there was little profit, but there was suffi
cient to maintain the breeder. Once racing was es
tablished beyond peradventure there were new pur
chasers in the field, the racing associations were en
abled to offer larger premiums, and horses began to
command a price commensurate with their earning
capacity. The gross total of premiums which went to
the successful horses have increased in proportion to
the increase of public patronage, until in this State
last year the large sum of $1,100,000 was so distributed.
This is an increase in round figures over 1898 of about
$125,000, and approximately over 1897 of $300,000.
Some idea of the growth of the spo*t which makes
such a condition possible may be found in the fact that
in 1895, the first year of operation under the Racing
Code, the total gross receipts of all the associations
holding licenses from the commission amounted in all
to only $504,414 50." (
We do not hear much in these days of the scheme
for annexing Cuba, but as a number of American cap
italists have undertaken to erect a grand tourist hotel
in Havana it will probably come out strong in due
time.
THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, -APIUL . .14, 1900.
THE MONGOLIAN INVASION.
DURING the thirty-four months that Colonel
John P. Jackson has been Collector of the
Port there have been admitted to this city over
ten thousand Chinese, and a very large percentage of
them has been admitted as natives of the United
States â that is to say. they have been admitted, not to
the country only, but to citizenship. That is a record
whose facts and figures in detail were published in The
Call yesterday, and its significance is doubtless, clear
to the mind of every intelligent reader.
Bad as the showing is upon its face, it appears even
worse upon investigation, for an examination into the
record discloses the fact that the rate of Mongolian
invasion is an increasing one, and that if something
be not done to check the stream the numbers to be
admitted in future will far surpass those of the past.
During the last two years of the collectorship of John
H. Wise, from June, 1895, to the end of Ma)', 1897,
the number of Chinese who applied for admission at
the port was 3792, of whom 3590 were admitted.
During the first two years of Jackson's term 7380
Chinese arrived here, and 7122 of them obtained en
trance. Within the seven months from June to the
end of December, 1899, there were admitted 2750
Chinese, and it is clear from that rate that the total
admissions for the year will be as high, if not higher,
than those of the preceding ones. Indeed it is known
that every steamer brings them in. The China has
just left forty-nine Chinese as natives of this country,
and the Doric has just arrived with forty-one more.
â¢ In this new immigration of Chinese there is an evil
which is worse than the old. for in times past the
Chinese came in admittedly* as aliens, but now they
are coming in large numbers under the claim of
being natives. The Mongolian native of the United
States is a citizen and has all the privileges of citizen
ship. He is entitled to a vote, and in elections in late
years quite a number of them have exercised the right.
Astute leaders of their race have perceived the ad
vantage the, bdlot gives, and it is not to be doubted
that ere long they will organize clubs of voters,
whose ballots will be offered to the highest bidder. We
shall then have rivalry among unscrupulous politi
cians for the Chinese vote, and the blight which will
inevitably affect our political system will be felt in
every election that takes place.
For the evils which are impending there must be a
remedy. It is evident the exclusion act cannot en
force itself, and that in the hands of unfaithful
officials it is nothing more than a means by which they
can levy tribute upon the incoming Chinese. The
clique of attorneys who are now co-operating with
the certain Chinese to make an open door for Mon
golian immigration at this port are the personal, so
cial and political friends of the Collector of the Port.
Their close association with him and the readiness
with which he admits the Chinese cloud his adminis
tration with suspicion, and incline to the belief that
he is more careful of friendship than of the law, more
zealous to promote the financial interests of the clique
than the welfare of the State.
Hardly had the exclusion act gone into effect be
fore the ease with which it could be made use of by
corrupt officials was disclosed. Chinese began to
find admission into the country all along the northern
border, from Puget Sound to New England. Again
and again scandals arising from abuses of the act
were exploited in the East. It was believed, however,
that the evil there was due solely to a lack of reso
lute public opinion in support of the law, and thers
was a general faith that there would be more efficiency
here, where the people are as one mind on the issue,
and understand the importance of upholding the law
in spirit and in letter for the protection of American
labor, American citizenship and American morals.
The disclosures now made show that faith to have
been ill founded. The very moment public attention
was turned away from the Chinese question the wily
Mongolians renewed their efforts to find admission,
and how successful they have been the record shows.
It is now imperative to arouse again the minds of the
people upon the issue, and revive that determined
resolution which in the past brought about the enact
ment of the exclusion law and for a time seemed to
have assured the country against coolie invasion.
In the present issue it is to be borne in mind that
the question now is not that of enacting a law, but of
enforcing one already enacted. It is not a question of
measures, but a question of men. If the officials of
the port will do their whole duty with no other thought
than that of upholding the act for the protection of the
country, there need be no other law than the one now
on the statute-books. The rapid immigration of Chi
nese under one pretense or another, and particularly
Jhe admission of so-called natives, is carried on only
because the practice is as profitable as it is ne
farious. Public indignation has checked Chinese im
migration in the past and can dp so again. Let its
full force be exerted now. A

ADVEHTISEMENTS.
DESERVES IT.
Remarkable Success of a New Treat-
ment for Piles.
For rr.any years it has been supposed
that the only absolutely sure cure for piles
was by surgical operation, but the danger
to life ar.d the pain and expense has been
to great that many thousands suffer for
years rather than submit to this last re-
sort; or they seek the temporary relief In
the many remedies claimed to relieve piles
and rectal troubles, salves, ointments and
similar simple remedies which give only
slight and very temporary relief.
A new preparation which Is painless and

Sealers Have a Scrap.
Max W'einer and Captain Hoffman of

set-to in Levy's clothing store yesterday.
Max has several marks of the affray on
his person, but Hoffman has a pair of
black eyes and a split cheek that will
keep the remembrance of Weiner's right
in his memory for some time to come. It
appears that Captain Hoffman owed Levy
a bill and when his vessel arrived he sent
the money to pay it up to the store by
one of his sailors, so he claims. The
money never reached Levy, and as Max
W'einer was the responsible man in the
matter he applied to the captain for the
cash as soon as he set foot in the store.

PLAN TO CHANGE
TRANSPORTS TO
NAVAL HANDS
Bill in Congress Providing
for the Transfer of
the Ships.
The bill introduced by Congressman
Levy providing for the transfer of the
transport service from the 'control of the
army to that of the navy has caused con
siderable discussion on this coast, where
the heaviest part of the transport work la
done. The general opinion among army
officers seems to be that the change would
not better the service and that*lt would
in some cases do it injury. The system Is
nearing completion and It is considered an
injustice to attempt to take it away from
these who have brought it to its present
efficiency.
There are several points in relation to
the transport service that will receive the
attention of this Congress and among
them is the proposition to make of the
transports a separate bureau.
The transport service of this country
has drawn the favorable notice of foreign
countries and Colonel Long, the officer in
charge of the service on this coast, has
been in receipt of letters and telegrams
from officers of the English. French. Ger
man, Russian and Japanese armies In
quiring into the system employed in the
transport service here and requesting In
formation on various points.
It is claimed by the officers of the United
States transport service that the business
is handled on, the same lines as a private
concern â than which system, they remark,
there is nothing cheaper or more efficient
in the way of handling steamers.
So far as the organization of the ser
vice goes it is claimed that the introduc
tion of a naval officer in command would
not change the reiations between the
troop commander on board and the mas
ter of the vessel from what it is now. The
relation of authority would be fixed by
the same regulation that governs it nowâ
that the master shall have absolute com
mand of the vessel and obey strictly his
sailing orders, and that the commander
of the troops shall have control of the
soldiers aboard and of nothing else. The
quartermaster now has no other duties
than those of a purser and under any
other â¢system,' it is claimed, he could not
be dispensed with nor could he be given
more or less authority.
And in conclusion it is claimed by the
transport officials that beyond the care
of tjie vessels, which, they say, has al
ways been in the best of hands, the busi
ness of the transport service is to handle
freight and passengers, a matter as for
eign to the navy as it has heretofore been
to the army so far as ocean traffic was
concerned. On this side of the country
over one hundred thousand passengers
and over six hundred thousand tons of
freight have been handled, and it is
claimed that it has been handled as
cheaply and. in fact, cheaper than It could
have been done by a private firm. It is
not believed the Levy bill will pass.

Case Is Dismissed.
A. F. "Wainwright, an Englishman
and once a well known polo player
at Burlingame, appeared before Judge
Cabaniss yesterday on a charge of
petty larceny by trick and device.
He went into the Bay State restau

expensive meal. He tendered a check for
$25 In payment and got the change. N.-M.
Adier, proprietor of the restaurant, pre
sented the check for payment and It was
marked "no funds." He Immediately
swore to a warrant for Wainwright's ar
rest. Wainwright explained that he had
deposited money in the bank repeatedly
and expectod a remittance from England
in timÂ« to meet the check. He paid Adle*.
the $25 and the Judge dismissed the case.
Wainwright has been playing bad JucK.
since his exodus from fashionable circles
last fall. Up in Nelson, B. C. last No

LITTLE PRUNING
TO BE DONE ON
FIRE ESTIMATES
Auditor Wells Expresses
His Satisfaction Over
. the Prospect.
Auditor Wells is expressing great satis
faction over the fact that the Fire Com
missioners in their estimates have prac
tically held within their actual require
ments. The total amount of the appro
priation asked by the commission was
$740,237. and it is thought by the Auditor
that this will be cut to a' figure slightly*
below $700,000. being In direct contrast to
several other departments, notably the
Board of Public Works, whose estimate
will probably be cut exactly in half.
The principal items which will be re
duced by the Auditor in the Fire Depart
ment estimate are as follows: General
supplies from $28,000 to $15,000, fuel from
$SBoo to $7500. hose $8000 to $6000. hydrants
$26,500 to $20,000, new apparatus $15,500 to
$14,000. The total expenses other than the
foregoing have been cut from $552,600 to
$540,230. In the latter amount are includ
ed: Salaries of the general department
$45,850, engine equipment $366,020, provision
for increase of $10 per month In the sala
ries of employes after serving one year,
hook and ladder companies with 86 men
$91,190; chemical engines. 7 companies. 14
men; water tower $3560. 2 companies, Â«
men; monitor batteries $2020, 2 companies.
2 men.
In the matter of hose the cut was made
because in cases of emergency the Chief
may order the appropriation of hose from
private firms handling that .commodity.
The department will construct fewer
hydrants than at first intended, and Audi
tor Wells has, suggested that the city op
erate its own foundry to manufacture
them. /

SOLEMN prayers and grand
music will usher in Easter
morn to-morrow. Church
bells will ring out over the city,
proclaiming that "Christ, the
Lord, is risen to-day." Sacred
edifices will be crowded with de
vout souls, who will sing out the
glad tidings; every heart will
pour forth thanks to Him and re
joice in His coming, for it is a
glorious epoch in the life of all
Christians.
The interior of all the churches
will be beautifully decorated in
lilies, ferns, smilax and sweet
smelling flowers appropriate to
the season of the year. Special
sermons will be preached from
many pulpits and the story of the
crucifixion and the resurrection
will again be told to listening
thousands.
To-day The Call, appreciating
the interest its readers take in the
musical services to be rendered
at the various churches, publishes
the programmes for their ben
efit. As will be observed, the mu
sical selections to be rendered
are the choicest in the wide col
lection of sacred compositions.
Augmented choirs and specially
engaged orchestras will render
the songs of praise and glory.

IX. MARY ANN LAMB.
(1765-1547.)
Mary arid Charles Lamb lived so practi
cally the brother-and-slster idyl which
poets have pictured that it is quite impos
sible for the biographer to dissociate
them.. When the baby brother came to
gladden Mary Lamb's barren existence
she joyfully became his sole caretaker and
devoted her long life to his physical and
mental development. Many were the anx
ious hours spent In fanning his frail little
life Into the flame which flickered through
sixty years of anxiety, charm and calam
ity. Her devotion to his development de
ferred for twenty years the hereditary In
sanity which hovered over their childhood
and at the same time prepared and
strengthened her charge for. the affection
ate sacrifice which later ennobled his life.
Thus, with the infancy of Charles Lamb,
began that Interdependence which distin
guished their common life.
With the eagerness of a child of 13 Mary
Lamb taught her 3-year-old brother to
read, so that Charles always declared that
he could not remember the time when he
did not know how. When only 7 the ner
vous and timid boy was entered at Christ's
Hospital to win his way among the throng
of burly lads who had there worn for hun
dreds of years the long-tailed blue coat
worn by Edward, the "boy king." who
had founded the school. Fearing lest the
little brother's diminutive stature, stutter
ing speech and delicate frame might
arouse the ridicule of the older boys, Mary
used to throw her shawl around her and
run down to watch them at play until the
recess hour was over. This attracted the
attention of Coleridge, a big blue-coat,
who In common with his fellows was cap
tivated by the little fellow's winsomeness,
and he begged to be Introduced to the
faithful sister behind the grating, thus
laying the foundation of that famous "fif
ty-year-old friendship without a dissen
sion."
While Charles was at school exhibiting
a wonderful docility and aptitude for the
classics, the faithful sister, who was never
sent to any school, was browsing in the
library of her father's patron and striving
to keep at least one lesson in advance of
the sorely missed brother. Oftentimes they
browsed together, and so thoroughly con
genial did their literary tastes become
that Charles Lamb came to think that his
sister attained her uncommon powers of
mind because of, rather than in spite of,
the defects of her singular education.
'Â¦Had I twenty girls," he writes in his
famous "Essays of Ella," "they should
be brought up exactly in this fashion. I
know not whether their chance in wed
lock might not be diminished by it. but
I can answer for it that It maketh (if
worst comes to worst) most Incomparable
Other training for this glorified spinster
hood was incessant toll at home, care for
an Intemperate father, nursing an Invalid
mother, whose fine mind had been warped
beyond recognition by unhappy marriage,
and interminable needlework to eke out
the straitened family means. Such harass
ing fatigue told so plainly on Mary
Lamb's strength that the neighbors some
times remarked to each other that the
girl seemed "wrong in the head, yet did
not consider her mind seriously affected.
The father finally lost his position
through Intemperance and the needlework
would not support the family, so Charles
was taken frcan school and obliged to be
gin his thirtyMour years of drudgery at
the "desk's dull wood."
This counting-house monotony was light
ened by the books which Mary borrowed
in order that they might study together
the well-beloved Elizabethan age, by his
friendship with Coleridge and by the en
couragement which sister and friend gave
to his modest literary beginnings. Charles
Lamb wrote spontaneously; because he
must he Jotted down on any convenient
scrap of paper the wit. whimsicalities and
wisdom which afterward crystallized Into
his inimitable essays. Sometimes the
brother and sister would indulge in a two
shilling seat at the theater. This love for
the drama expressed Itself later In a plajr
written by Charles Lamb called 'Mr. H.,
which Mary Lamb Induced the manager of
Drury Lane to accept. Great was her
grief, consequently, when this play was
hissed off the stage the first night, nor
was her disappointment anywise lessened
when she perceived her sensitive brother
chief among the hissers. ;^
When Charles Lamb was 20 he besan
trying his hand at verse making, partly
In emulation of Coleridge, partly because
he became greatly Interested In a young
lady in the neighborhood. His attach
ment to this young lady opened his eyes
to the apparent hopelessness of his future;
with a father In- his dotage, a mother an
invalid, a sister almost deranged by her
hopeless struggle with poverty, all de
pendent upon the few pounds which his
clerkship brought, what outlook was there
for his future? Brooding over the strug
gle between love and duty brought upon
him the fatal family legacy and for sev
eral weeks It was necessary to keep him
under restraint.
This attack undoubtedly affected his sis
ter's malady â¢ and hastened her nervous
breakdown. Worn with needlework and
the dally and nightly care of the mother,
whom she greatly loved, she temporarily
lost her reason and In one of her wildest
frenzies brought about the calamity un
der whose shadow the brother and sister
dwelt during the remainder of their days.
Lamb thus writes to Coleridge: "I will
only give you the outlines: My poor. dear,
dearest sister, in a fit of Insanity has been
the death of her own mother. I was at
hand only time enough to snatch the
knife out of her grasp. She is at present
in a madhouse, from whence, I fear, she
must be moved to an hospital. â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢
With me 'the former things are passed
away' and I have something more to do
than to feel. God Almighty have us well
In his keep. C. Lamb." ... ,
From that moment duty gained the vic
tory' and Charles Lamb renounced all his
aspirations and hopes of earthly blessing
to devote his maturity entirely to the care
of that "poor, dear, dearest sister," who
had sacrificed her youth for him. Al
though but 21 when he took the vows of,
self-abnegation, his youth was gone for
ever When Mary Lamb's mind again
cleared she was In such frame of mind
that she believed herself purified and ab
solved from the horror committed when
ehe was not responsible, and always re
ferred to her mother with such calmness
and naturalness that many believed her
ignorant of the tragedy.
Exhaustion from nursing an old aunt
who had made her home with them again
brought on a violent attack. These Ill
nesses as her brother affectionately called
them recurred annually, sometimes more
frequently. Fortunately a nervous sleep
lessness gave warning of the dread ap
proach and Mary so fully comprehended
their Import that she herself packed a
straitjacket when- they started on their
journeys. They were frequently met go
ing across Hampstead Heath hand in
hand to the asylum, both crying bitterly.
It is probable that this ever-watchful so
licitude and sympathy on Charles' part
prevented a recurrence of his early at
tack and kept his reason unclouded to
During her Intervals of saneness Mary
Lamb was again the devoted sister,
guarding her brother's work from Inter-
ruption. making homelike and cozy their
frequently changed quarters and unos
tentatiously welcoming their literary
friends to Lamb's famous Wednesday
evenings. She, too, was greatly loved and
respected by the choice circle of spirits.
Hazlitt, ordsworth. Barry Cornwall,
Leigh Hunt and ColeriJge. who there
weekly "skimmed the cream of criti
cism."
When Mary Lamb was "from home"
her brother longed constantly for her re
turn, writing thus to Miss Wordsworth:
"To say all that I know of her would be
more than I think anybody could believe
er even understand, and when I hope to
have her well apain with me it would be
sinning against her feelings to go about
to praise her. She Is older and wiser and
better than I. and all my wretched Imper
fections I cover to myself by resolutely
thinking on her goodness. She woulJ
share life and death, heaven and hell,
with me. She lives but for me. and I
Know I have been wasting and teasing
her life for five years past incessantly
with my curs*d ways of going on." Here
Charles Lamb touches the keynote of the
tragedy. His intemperate habits grieved
his sister to the heart, and. much as they
loved one another, their "dual loneliness
had a bad effect upon both. When Mary's
"poor moythered wits" were clearest she
was filled with apprehension of returning
attacks and fearful lest such strain
would finally unbalance her brother's
mind and force him to some rash act.
When Charles, on the other hand, saw her
malady Increased by worrying over him
be would become nervous, irritable, re
morseful, intoxicated, and thus hasten the
return of the attack which they dreaded.
He died many years before hi.s sister.
whose mind was by that time so greatly
shattered that she was spared the shock
of his death and lived on peacefully, re
calling only the happy part of the past.
The tragic existence of . this famous
brother and sister would not now be re
membered were it not for their literary
work, which perpetuated their united per
sonality. Cnarles Lamb will ever be re
membered for his essays, full of tender
ness, delicacy, pathos and quaint sur
prises and for the high value of his criti
cal faculty. His "Essay on the Genius of
Hogarth" is by many considered thÂ»
finest critical paper in the English tongue.
And Mary will not be forgotten because of
her collaboration with her brother In thÂ©
"Tales from Shakespeare." which have
delighted so many generations of chil
dren.
Godwin, the publisher, suggested that
Mary Lamb undertake this work, but she
did not feel herself worthy until her
brother swore that she had supplied all
the ideas he ever had. So they accom
plished it together. Charles wrestling
with the tragedies, while Mary took the
more fantastic or humorous plays, and
right bravely did she acquit herself. Can
ycu imagine more tragic effort at com
edy than this family presented when you
consider the blackness into which Charles
Lamb dipped his pen that he might write
jokes (with tears on his face) for his half
mad sister, while she. faithful afflicted
soul, in her moments of sanity was try
ing to make the humor of Shakespeare
palatable to children? Both were so sat
urated in Elizabethan diction that it was
a peculiarly easy task for them when they
could not use the great poet's exact word-
Ing, as they frequently did, to approxi
mate It closely from their own vocabu
lary.
It la good to think that this venture
landed them financially away above their
simple necessities, so that in their old age
they enjoyed to the full the luxury of
giving. After Charles had passed away it
was his aged slater's delight to keep up
the pensions to needy friends in which
they had taken such pleasure. In her last
years she, too, was pensioned by loving
friends, but the nature of her infirmity
mercifully spared her that knowledge.
Happily and peacefully she was laid to
rest beside her brother. Like Caroline
Herschel, she had lived in her brother's
Interest, but Caroline Herschel's self-ef
facement was scientific serfdom, while
Mary Lamb's was full partnership In a
life of tragedy and self-sacrifice.
It is interesting to know that Mary
Lamb's Shakespearean labors did. not end
with her collaboration with her brother.
Among the children whom ehe taught
with the little Emma Isola. whose adop
tion brightened the sadness of the Lamb
household, were Hazlltt's son and Mary
Victoria Novello. This little girl became
Mary Cowden Clark, whose "Concord
ance" of Shakespeare first took shape in
her mind when she listened to her gentle
teacher's reading of the manuscript of
the "Tales." For this reason Elbert Hub
bard calls Mary Lamb "the grandmother"
of the Justly famous "Concordance."
weeks, for which he demanded $5000 dam
ages. Judge Hunt, however, said that
the only person he could find who was en
titled to damages for heart disease was
the landlord and judgment was rendered
accordingly.
Witnesses are willing to testify that at
the time Soher was carrying on the liti
gation with the proprietor of the Hotel
Francisco he was a constant visitor at
the track. Not long since he was Been
with $5000 in a leather bag, which was tha
cynosure of the eyes' of two burly body
guards, going the rounds of the pool boxes
at Tanforan. With the passing hours,
however, the use of the bodyguards waned
and the end of a day saw them dismissed
and the leather sack empty.
Practically Disinherited.
Practically disinherited by his father,
and only coming into possession of the
funds which he has squandered at the
track and at the downtown pollrooms
through "4he kindness of his brothers and
sisters, it is difficult to understand the
inlluences that led Adolph Soher to be
come an embezzler. His case stands out
as the mo&t startling evidence of the evil
influence of the racetrack and kindred
fleecing agencies. The manner in which
the funds of his dead father came into
his possession is strange.
Lewis Soher, a man well known in the
business world, died September 22, 18S7,
leaving an estate valued at over 575,000.
In a will bearing date of MXirch 16, 18S5,
he made specitic bequests to his widow,
Celia A. Soher, and to his children, Caro
line Iversen, Adeline F. Holt, Louisa
Hunt and Adolph. Emlle, Merlam, Jo
seph Augustus and Henry Soher. Adolph
was given but $500, his father stating
that at the time of his son's marriage he
had given him $1000. Adolph Soher, how
ever, was included In the will among the
residuary legatees, but in a codicil dated
April 29. ISMi, he was precluded from
sharing in the residue of the estate by
reason, his father said, of his conduct
toward his parents. Upon the filing of
the will Adolph immediately filed a
contest to the codicil, but he met defeat
in his efforts to have the same declared
null and void. While the matter was
pending on appeal, however, a compromise
was f-ffected and the contest was dismiss
ed. Decedent's widow, Celia A. Suher,
and T. K. Wilson, who were named in
decedent's will as executrix and executor,
then continued in the even tenor of the
settlement of the estate.
In May of ISS9 Celia A. Soher died, and
in December of 1800 Mr. Wilson resigned
his trust. Adolph Soher and his brother,
Emlle Soher, forthwith tiled application
for letters of administration upon the es
tate and, in the absence of opposition to
Adolph, notwithstanding the fact that his
father distrusted him and practically dis
inherited him, the court granted the ap
plication, and Adolph and Emile entered
upon the trust. A bond of $11,000 was ex
acted from them by the court, but this
was subsequently reduced to $2500. On
this bond the names of S. F. Long of chis
city, Bon K. Thorn. Mrs. Soher's father,
and Louisa Hunt, the embezzler's sister,
appeared as sureties. Subsequently Mrs.
Hunt applied to Judge Troutt to release
her from further liability on the bond,
and in view of the standing of the other
two sureties the court granted her appli
cation.
Sells Estate Property.
Xot long after their appointment
Adolph and Emile Soher applied to the
court for leave to sell the real property
belonging to the estate. The court grant
ed the order, but first ordered that the ex
ecutors produce a bond each, holdln;r
their sureties liable for double the sum
that would come into their possession
through the sale of the property. The
American Surety Company of New York
qualified on Adolph's bond and Emlle pro
duced a bond qualified upon by another
company.
The property was sold and the return
showed that Adolph retained in his pos
session, after the payment of all expenses.
commiFsions and a few small legacies, the
sum of $22,515 30. Emlle Soher, his co-ad
ministrator, retained a like sum. Adolph
deposited the funds which came into his*
possession with the California Bank. This
has all been drawn out and next Wednes
day, when Judge Troutt calls up the mat
ter of the settlement of the final account
of the administrators of the late Lewis
Soher, there will be no answer from at
least one executor, but those to whom he
is responsible will answer for him and file
action apainst the American Surety Com
pany of New York to recover the sum of
his peculations.
Attorney J. C. McKee, 230 Montgomery
street, who has represented the fugitive
during the past five years, manifested but
little surprise when ho learned yesterday
that his client had fled the State.
Soher's Attorney Not Surprised.
"The fact that he has left the city adds
but one additional point to an ofttold
etnrv, and that one point is that he has
left "the city." said Mr. McKee. "Some
time ago various parties interested in the
estate told me that he was leading a fast
life at the racetrack and I warned him
that if such stories reached the ears of
the managers of the American Surety
Company he would find himself without a
bondsman. He continually denied the
Btories, but finally D. I. Mahoney, who

man, Clay & Co.'s Hall on Thursday evening, April 26. She will be as
sisted by Armand Solomon, with selections on the violin, and Louis yon
der Mehden Jr., cellist. Miss Stencel is about to make her departure for
the East, where she will continue to develop her wonderful talent, and this re
cital will be the last one she will be able to give In this city for somÂ© time.
Alma Stencel is a pupil of Hugo Mansfeldt. Her teacher is convinced that she
possesses every qualification that is to be found in the greatest pianists of the
present age, and his opinion has been indorsed by the leading musicians who have
visited this city. Paderewski, after hearing the child play one piece, insisted that
she go through the entire programme which has been scheduled for the publio
at her farewell recital. He spoke enthusiastically of her beautiful expression and
tone production and of her remarkable technique.
Little Alma was proclaimed "the remarkable genius of the century" by Vlad
imir de Pachmann, and a great future has been predicted for her by Rosenthal,
Saver, Scharwenka and lime. Carreno. The proceeds of the recital will assist the
child in continuing her study and every effort should be made that It may be a
financial success.

a "killing" in the first race. She opened
at 30 to 1. but at the close fives were the
best offered. Pauline- J, the favorite,

matter and has made the following state
ment:
"As for Jare Kan, who you say went to
China to open in Hongkong an agency for
the importation of Chinese to this country.
It is true he and I were friendly, but be
yond that there was nothing between us.
He did go to Hongkong as stated, and as
far as I know is there yet. He went as
an agent for a transportation company,
but if also for any other purpose I do not
know it. I made inquiries at the office of
the transportation company and find that
Jare Kan's contract with it has expired.
P'urther than this I know nothing of thia
whole matter.
"The attack in The Call came as a
thunderbolt from a clear sky. I know of
no occurrences naturally leading to it,' nor
any motive for the publication. I pro
nounce it malicious, untruthful, vindic
tive and libelous. There has been noth
ing in my administration of the Chinese
business which can justly subject me to
either criticism or reproach. My course
in Chinese cases has in every instance
been fully justified by the law and the tes
timony In the case. I do not personally
examine Chinese applicants or their wit
nesses; all that is done in the Chinese
Bureau, where are seventeen persons em
ployed for that purpose. The majority ot
the Chinese inspectors are gentlemen sent
here by the department from other parts
of the linked States; skilled in their busi
ness, honest and capable. They make the
examinations in these cases and report the
testimony to me, together with their sum
ming up of any contrarltles, contradic
tions or inconsistencies in the testimony.
Upon this record I decide the cases, apply
ing the law to the circumstances as de
tailed by the Chinese Bureau.
"I may say here that 'returning labor
ers' need no examination under the law.
They are admitted upon the return permit,
which is given to them when they leave,
without further examination. 'Returning
merchants' need two white witnesses to
testify to the integrity of their claim. The
five classes of Chinese named in the
treaty coming here for the first time need
what Is known as a section 6 certificate,
to be obtained in China from their own
Government and vised by the United
States Consul at the port where the cer
tificate is obtained. Under the law these
certificates are not required to be In the
English language, but may be in the lan
guage of the country of which the appli
cant Is a subject. I have, however. In
sisted In all cases that an English trans
lation shall accompany, the certificate
when in a foreign language.
"The figures given in The Call's ar
ticle are erroneous. In that they con
vey the impression that all persons
arriving and admitted at this port
are first visits. The fact is that a
great majority of them are simply re
turning merchants and laborers, who
have a right to come and go as they please
under the law. Also, the fact is, that dur
ing my administration during the past
three years I have admitted fewer Chi
nese at this port than have departed
therefrom in each and every uno of the
three years. .-7
"As to returning merchants and labor
ers I have no discretion which permits
me to refuse them a landing when they
demand it under the law. No laborers
whatever are admitted any longer for the
first time.
"Coming now to the subject of 'native
born* Chinese, it Is objected in the article
that I accept Chinese testimony. I am
compelled to do so under the law; the
United States courts having decided that
such is proper testimony, and the depart
ment having ruled in the following words:
"The uncontradicted testimony of Chinese
witnesses as to birth of laborers In the
United States Bhould not be rejected.'
This is the ruling of the Secretary of the
Treasury, issued to me May 24, IS9S, and
is printed for the government of all Col
lectors In the United States..
"It Is very difficult to meet with serious
argument, Invidious .reflections, malevo
lent Innuendoes, unfounded inferences and
baseless conclusions mingled promiscu
ously in this article. I can only answer
generally that the Chinese business has
been conducted here honestly, impartially,
regularly and according to law and the
rules of the department.
"I challenge Investigation into each and
every transaction, down to the minutest
detail; and the man who charges me with
any sinister purpose, sordid motive, per
sonal Interest or partiality to any lawyer
or any Chinaman or any other person,
tells what Is basely false. It is an accept
ed maxim In the Custom-house that no
man has ever had anything to do with
the Chinese business but that sooner or
later he would be smirched with false ac
cusations and baseless rumore against
him.
"I suppose, therefore, that I should ac
cept this attack after three years of un
crfticlzed service as my share of personal
sacrifice In the cause. I shall not, how
ever, rest passively under such an un
called-for attack, but propose to ascertain
and hold responsible the parties, whoever
they may be, interested in making It."
In Interviews given to other newspapers
Colonel Jackson accused the manager of
The Call of an attempt to Injure the Re
publican party by the expose of the Chi
nese ring. Perhaps Colonel Jackspn does
not yet appreciate the seriousness of the
Injury he has Inflicted upon the Republi
can party by being responsible for the
landing of 3000 coolies who are now legal
ly native-born citizens of the United
States, and Â«s well qualified as Collector
Jackson, utt't the law, to vote.
of the United States declares that for
every "merchant" there may be a "mer
chant's" wife.
The Chinese, ever on the lookout, were
quick to see their tremendous advantage
and quick to seize It. Meetings of the
local slave dealers were held at once, and
it was decided to send an agent to Hong
kong to arrange for the wholesale im
portation of "merchants' wives." If it is
easy to run a "merchant" past the bar
riers, it will be quite as easy to put the
wives through, and the profit, which is
now already great, will be enormous.
At the meeting held In this city Lucy
Kwong, the notorious and wealthy leader
of the slave dealers, was the presiding
spirit, and he decided that Lee Chee, in
terpreter en the Japanese line of steam
ers plying between this port and the
Orient, should go to Hongkong to begin
the dreadful traffic that shall further out
rage the people of this city. Lee Chee
left this city on the first day of this
month on the steamer Hongkong Maru.
He is to be the pioneer in the slave trade
of new San- Francisco.
Ho Vow, the Chinese Consul General in
this city, is sadly disturbed over the ex
pose made by The Call and he promises
that if his efforts will avail he will Induce
his Government to make an Inquiry, par
ticularly in reference to the remarkable
fact and, what he admits to be, extremely
suspicious circumstance that a great ma
jority of the "native sons" entering this
port claim to have departed before June
6, ISS2. Ho Vow denies, however, that he
has in any way been a party, to the gross
frauds which The Call has exposed. He
says that as the representative of his
Government in this city he has done and
will do his best to serve the interests of
his countrymen, but that he will neither
do anything nor countenance anything In
violation of the laws of this country.
"I am very sorry," he said last night,
"that I am accused of being a part of
the conspiracy to land Chinese In this city,
as I have had nothing whatever to do
with it. It is true that I know most of
the gentlemen mentioned,' but our rela
tions have not been dishonorable I assure
you. I met Arthur Spear In Washington
and entertained him. He is th"c son of
the Surveyor of the Port, you konw, and a
nice young gentleman. When I came
here he entertained me and our relationa
naturally are very cordial.
"It was he who introduced me to Mr.
Pippy, and I admit we did play poker at
the Union League Club. But our games
were for small amounts and I did not lose
much. It was a trifling matter. We
playedoccasionally until the club decided
that poker should ;ho longer be played In
the rooms. Then we went to the Occi
dental Hotel and playedâ let me .seeâ it
was not poker, but a new game, the name
of which I really cannot remember."
The Consul sighed, Bmlled and contin
ued: * .
"The employment of Mr. Pippy as attor
ney by the Chinese is really an interesting
thing. You know, the Chinese are a pecu
liar people. They value nothing like suc
cess. When a lawyer loses a case for
them they g.o to another who can win, and
in the landing of Chinese Mr. Pippy has
been very successful. Really I could not
tell the reason why ho has been more
successful than others, but the fact .re
mains that he has been.
"The Call has done me an injustice In
saying that I gave orders that no more
Chinese were to be landedâ l mean those
that came on the China. I have no doubt
that the attorneys held conferences, as The
Call stated, but I had nothing to do with
them. I was engaged in some festivities
and paid no attention to the matter.
"You ask me if I do not think
it a very suspicious circumstance that
the great majority of Chinese claim
ing admission here as native-born
citizens declare that they left San
Francisco before June 6, 1882P I
certainly do think it suspicious, and
if my efforts will avail my Govern
ment shall make a strict inquiry into
the matter. I cannot understand it
and have only a supposition upon
which to offer an explanation.
"When the Chinese registration
act went into operation in 1894 many
of the Chinese, fearful of an innova
tion which they did not understand,
fled from the country. I suppose,
and, mind you, It is only a supposi
tion, many of them are now return
ing by the native son route.
Collector of the Port Colonel John P.
Jackson also desired to be heard Jn the
represents Emlle Soher. told me that my
client was losing large sums of money at
th "In r the'face of my client's denial I was
loth to belleVe the stories, but if it is a
fact that he has fled the city a basis for
the same must have existed. Some time
ago a petition to remove my client as ad
ministrator was made by the heirs of the
estate on the ground that he was mis
managing the estate, but the court held
that the charges were without basis. He
has since managed the estate well to the
best of my knowledge, and the assertion
that he has disappeared with all of the
funds in his charge seems incredible, but
that he had free access to the same can
not be denied "
Adolph Was Intractable.
Emile Soher. Co-administrator of the es
tate, said that he did not care to go Into
a detailed history of the litigation.
"We have had a great deal of trouble
over the property left by my father,'
he said, "and my brother Adolpn has been
responsible for it all. Adolph has been
fighting us all, and it was only lately that
he agreed to a settlement of the affair.
We expected to get the matter all settled
up by "the 20th of this month, but when
the end will come now I cannot tell."
James R. Oarniss. manager of the surety
company, expressed the opinion that the
corporation would take steps to apprehend
the fugitive and to try and prove that he
was an embezzler. "But what Is the use?
he added. "We may prove that he is an
embezzler, but if he has no funds there
will be little satisfaction in such a pro
ceeding for us. They are falling like the
leaves of autumn, and there seems to be
no help for them or vs â no way to stop
this common crime, embezzlement."

"The assertion made before the
San Francisco Labor Council by a
party named E. T. Indermill to the
effect that Japanese coolie labor was
being imported to work at the Salinas
sugar mill is a falsehood, pure and

ISLAND TRAFFIC
THREATENED BY
FOREIGN SHIPS
Postponing Application, of
Navigation Laws Is the
Scheme.
Chamber of Commerce Makes Protest
to tie Congressmen and Invites
Aid of Portland Mer
chants.
The chirping merchants of the city are
much concerned about the amendment
proposed by Representative Cushman of
Washington to the Hawaiian bill before
Congress. Letters and telegrams have
cone on to Senators and Congressmen
from California and the aid of the Port
land Chamber of Commerce has been in
vited to defeat the amendment now In
conference. The amendment proposes to
postpone the application of the naviga
tion laws to Hawaii for one year. This
would permit foreign ships to do coast
wise business to Hawaii, which is defined
as "trade between ports of the United
States." For two years it has been sup
posed that the laws of the United Stales
would be applied to Hawaii.
The Cushman amendment was notice
that there would te an effort to exempt
the navigation laws. The San Francisco
Chamber of Commerce has taken the lead
on this coast in mailing vig-orous protest.
Statistics have bc-en forwarded to Senator
Perkins by Secretary Scott, pointing out
the rncrisure of harm in the amendment
for this i>ort. Foreign ship owners have
taken the other side ar.d the pilots also
favor the amendment because the applica
tion cf the navigation laws would take
the foreign vessels, from which they de
rive pilotage, off the line. Statistics from
the shipping' mvn are summarized as fol
lows: The carrying capacity of the Amer
ican fleet is 402.308 tons per annum, on thÂ«
Labis of four trips, and the sugar crop to
be moved Is estimated at 300,000. This dis
poses of the assertion of the foreign ship
owners that the tonnage is Insufficient,
for the freights from the islands exceed in
I'Ulk those to the islands. Several large
concerns are Interested here and there Is
en Eastern interest, for many cargoes of
sufrar will .go directly to the East from
the islands by water. The dispatch to the
Portland Chamber of Commerce is as fol
io wb:
We have wired Senator Perkins requesting
Ms efforts- to have navigation laws in lmme
d.ate effect. Also sent him mall statistics
rhowlnj atr.ple tonnagre under our flag to handle
trade. Also requested co-operation of our dele
gation. I'lease take similar action with delega
tion. This was tigned by President Charles
Neison.
Dun's Review of Trade.
NEW YORK. April IS.â R. G. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review to-morrow will say: Iron fur
naces In blast April 1 produced 259.482 tons
weekly, against 292,648 March 1, but ynsold
stocks Increased 2280 tons. A mistaken infer
ence, possibly fatal to many In consequence.
Is that stocks held by consuming concerns must
be running down. As they contract for their
supplies months ahead, and such supplies,
whether delivered and consumed or waiting
their orders at furnaces, would not be reck
oned In unsold stocks, the surplus owned by
consumers may be heavy, for new business In
finished products Is reported to the Iron Age
from Plttsburg as "frightfully small," owing
to the belief that high prices cannot bÂ« main
tained and no better report comes from Phila
delphia. With No. 1 anthracite $2 lower, refined
bars $4 and steel plates $11 per ton lower than
In December It can hardly be called impossible
for prices to yield, though many are so far
firmly held. Plttsburg reports a number of
plate mills shut down and five Pennsylvania
and Ohio furnaces have stopped, perhaps for
repairs, more than balancing five which started
In March, two In Tennessee, adding 2600 tons
weekly.
The boot and Shoe Industry also falls behind
In output and In dosing some work* and run
ning many others part time, because prices are
higher than retailers seem ready to pay.
A heavy wholesale business has been done
In dry goods, but the question Is now whether
retail distribution will Justify It. As yet re
turns are not satisfactory. There U an in
crease, but not enough to warrant the buying
from mills. Woolens and worsteds are dull,
with concessions in fancies, though staples are
well sold up and are firm, the material declines
further averaging nearly half a cent lower than
April. 1- There is the same uncertainty in cot
ton Koods .as In retail distribution, with quite
as much doubt whether prices will be main
tained, though the material has been again ad
vanced a sixteenth In speculation.
Exports In March were in value $33,096,755
a Rain over last year of $21.526,895, so rapidly
bat Eurone supplied Its needs. This enormous
gain made exports of the chief staples $IS.Â£U,
&33 greater in value than in March of last year
though a decrease occurred In other Items. Yet
only a fraction of the gain was In cotton ship
.ments from New York, leaving the other great
Increase here to be explained by manufactured
exports mainly. In spite of the heavy balance
due on merchandise account there has been
talk of cold exports and a -small amount has
cone to Buenos Ayres ' on European account.
Supplies of money are abundant here; the banks
having again* gained largely. Rates are low
and commercial demands narrow and the In
terior is better prepared than ever to do with
out aid. . - ... . . . . . .

TEST OF LIQUID AIR
AS A REFRIGERATOR
Trainload of OTang-es Starts East and
Both Ice and Air Will Be
Used.
Special Dlrpatch to The Call.
SAN* BERXARDIXO. April 13.â The first
experiment with liquid air as a refriger
ating agent in the shipment of oranges
left here this morning on the Santa Fe. A
train of twenty-five cars was shipped by
the Pomona Fruit Exchange, of which
eeven were to use liquid air and eighteen
the usual supply of ice. The fruit was
under the care of William T. Simms of
Riverside, an experienced fruit handler,
and the instructions were very explicit.
Each car has four hatches, and these are
to remain open each night until morning
for ventilation purposes, together with
Bide doors when thought necessary. Each
morning three hatches will be closed, and
through the fourth a bottle of liquid air
Â¦will be poured into the ice box, formerly
so called, and the hatch closed rjulekly.
This bottle to each car will last one day.
and at night the cars are again ventilated
w!th the cool air and in the morning an
other bottle will 1-e used. Mr. Simms
took with him thirty-six bottles of liquid
air for seven cars for the trip to Kansas j
City, the destination of the fruit.
The experiment is watched here with
great interest, for if successful it will
jevolutionize the shipment of fruit to the
East and save the annual use of millions
of tons of ice. This means the increasing
of the carrying capacity of each car by
onc-Fixth, or an addition of sixty to
seventy-five more boxes of oranges to
each car as now loaded. If euccessful the
manufacture of liquid air will be estab- I
Jished on a large scale at Los Angeles and !
probably at other points. The only tool
needed for Its use is a corkscrew, and the
shippers of tho fruit to-day anxiously
asked Mr. Bisims if he carried a cork
ecrew, and he replied that being from
Riverside he was supplied.

measure of strength on their own account.
When the Stock Exchange adjourned on Thurs
day it did so not to resume business until next
Monday, Saturday of this week being added to
the usual holiday on Good Friday.
The quotations for some of the more active
railroad stocks end the week higher than they
were on last Saturday, while many indus
trials are decidedly lower. The week was
marked by a further falling off In the amount
of outside orders and business and by Increased
evidences of manipulation, while London,
which was Inclined to be dull. In- view of the
nearness of the holidays, was also affected by
the less promising aspects of the British opera
tions in South Africa and by the Increasing
firmness of money, showed an Inclination at
times to sell the stocks It recently bought here.
Americans, however, continued to be a leading
feature In London and European buying was
again somewhat in excess of the sales ascribed
to foreign interests. Our market has, however,
begun to notice the strength of exchange rates,
though sterling rates are still about >i per cent
below the level at which gold exports found
circulation. In fact, $500,000 In gold is going
from New York to Buenos Ayres on a London
order. It is realized that the relatively firm
money market at London and the prospect of
further ease here In regard to loans and Inter
est rates may well result in the transfer of con
siderable amounts of capital from New York
to Europe. Here the financial situation is cer
tainly not averse to the stock market. The de
crease shown in last Saturday's bank statement
had no effect and the gains of the New York
banks from the Treasury and the interior prom
lEe to result in a favorable statement to-day.
In spite. of a presumable Increase in Wall-street
borrowings. Offerings of funds on call are
more freely made and the confidence in the
financial position, which asserted itself after
the currency bill was passed and the Govern
ment refunding plan put In operation is un
impaired. Continued Increase In railroad earn
ings and fair If not favorable crop prospects
have aided In giving railway shares their
strong tone. On the other hand, the fact that
the Iron and other trades still enjoy uninter
rupted prosperity did not seem to bring sup
port to the industrial group, the steel stocks,
as already mentioned, being an especially weak
feature.
It would seem that Is due to the forced
liquidation of holdings of the common stock
of such companies, brought on by the growing
doubts which have lately been excited regard-
Ing dividends on that class of the shares of
several companies.

Bradstreet 's on Trade.
NEW YORK, April 13.â Bradstreet' s to-mor
row will say: Backward sprint: weather condi
tions hayÂ« figured considerably In distributive
trade reports this week, and In connection with
some weakness In prices of leading: stocks, have
Imparted an appearance of irregularity to the
general situation. Ar-other of those downward
swings In the prices of agricultural staples is
exhibited this week In slightly lowered prices
for cereals, partly because of the bearish posi
tion of the Immediate supplies and partly be
cause of the better than expected Govern
ment crop report, which Is taken to In
dicate a position that winter wheat will yield In
excess of all records. The crop outlook as a
whole favors the expectation of a large yield
of corn and cotton. Corn and oats have sym
pathized with the reaction In pork products,
which reaction, however, has not been univer
sal, as shown by the fact that lard 4s at the
highest point reached on the present boom.
Cotton exports in March were three times those
of a year ago in value, and for seven months
are 7 per cent greater In value, while 23 per
cent smaller in quantity.
Evidences accumulate that active missionary
work In favor of lower prices for iron and steel
is at last bearing fruit. Prices were no lower
and stocks as a whole are claimed to be no
larger than a month ago, but steel products
have weakened noticeably during the week,
billets notlnc the sharpest decline, with cor
responding decreases in some other products.
The other metals show little change on the
week, copper belnsr In continued good demand
and firm, while tin is speculatlvely weaker,
and lead is strong at previous prices. The
hardware trade returns reports as a whole
relatively better, the best advices coming from
Western distributive centers.
A slight upward swing In cotton is to be
noted this week and Southern mills have ad
vanced prices. On the other hand while the
mills are active on old orders, new business Is
reported of smaller volume. Some more In
quiry is noted In raw wool, without, how
ever, affecting values. ,
The strength of raw sugar Is a reflection
chiefly of the fact that a considerable short
age is looked for in the supplies of cane sugar,
not only In Cuba but In the Far East. The
margin between raw and refined allows of no
profit at present prices. Anthracite coal is
rather weak at the decline/ shown In the win
ter list price, but bituminous is strong, particu
larly on account.
Wheat. Including flour, shipments for the
week aggregate 2.898,653 bushels, against 3 836 -
963 bushels last week. 1,953,61 D bushels In the
corresponding week of 1899, 4,425,302 bushels In
1898, 1.344.013 bushels In 1597 and 2,017,679 bushels
In 1856. Since July 1, this season, the exports
of wheat aggregate 153.906.296, apalnst 190,329,
159 last year and 188.271.550 in 1897-38.
Business failures for the week number 152.

OLD MAN DIES
OF STARVATION
IN BERKELEY
John C Kenyon, a Hermit,
Found Dead, Deserted
and Neglected.
t Â»
BERKELEY, April 13.â John C. Ken
yon, 72 years of age, was found dead in
his cabin in West Berkeley last evening.
The case is very pitiable and shows neg
lect and carelessness. The surroundings
of his norae and the condition of the body
indicate that death waa by starvation. In
the midst of a populous neighborhood
the poor old man passed away neglected
and thrown aside by his friends.
Eight years ago Kenyon purchased a
twenty-five-foot lot. The property, how
ever, was immediately transferred to Ken
von's sister, who then resided in San
Francisco. Since then no trace of her has
been found. He had a little money at first,
and with odd jobs at coopering he man
aged to subsist without any outside aid.
Lately he has had to depend on wood cut
ting and clam digging. . At his age the
exposure necessitated in clam digging was
too severe for him. He contracted a cold,
which developed into pneumonia, prevent
ing him from earning his livelihood, and
the consequence was that he starved to
death. Mr. Kenyon was too -weak to pur
sue his regular habits, and none of the
neighbors paid any attention to his dis
appearance. His home consisted of a lit
tle shanty 10x12 feet, and when Inspected
by Marshal Lloyd and Deputy Coroner
Strelghtlff this afternoon was found in a
most deplorable condition. There was not
a morsel of tood In the place, except part
of an orange, and there was even evi
dence that the old man had died from
lack of food.

The annual election held by the Ebell
Society to-day terminated In the choice of
Mrs. Kate A. Bulkley for president. Mrs.
R. P. Gleason, the retiring president, re
ceived a large enough complimentary vote
to make the balloting interesting, thougn
she was not on the ticket arid had asked
her friends to retrain from casting their
votes for her. The number of the oallots
cast was ISO, less than one-half oi the
membership of the club.
The election is considered the most in
teresting in the society's history, for it
hinged on an issue â that of federation
with the State organisationâ and never
before has there been an issue, but merely
the question of popularity and special fit
ness.
The friends of federation warmly advo
cated Mrs. Gleason for re-election, believ
ing that she deserved it for the excellent
service of the past year. So she was askod
to take a place on the ticket and even to
head an independent ticket. All of which
she refused to do. The anti-federlsts have
as warmly sought to put a strong mem
ber at the society's head who would not
declare for State federation. And after
some trouble and search secured but one
acquiescence to their nominationsâ Mrs.
Bulkley.
But in spite of Mrs. Gleason's stand she
was virtually a part of the ticket to-day,
even though she had communicated with
her friends asking them to support Mrs.
Buikley and had written Mrs. Uulkley to
the same effect. To-day in the face of all
Mrs. Gleason's determination votes were
cast for her so that she was forced, even
at the ballot-box in the LJbell rooms, to
try and prevent votes being cast for her.
This she did by putting up a notice thank-
Ing all who were eager to see her elected
for their kindness, but requesting that
they keep to the ticket for the sake of
harmony, declaring that she could not
again accept the offlce.
The election as it resulted must be, a
satisfying one, even for those who were
Mrs. Gleason's strongest supporters. For
Mrs. Bulkley, the new president, is capa
ble, popular and one of the organization's
most untiring and deserving members.
During the past year she has Deen record
ing secretary and has done a great amount
of work In connection with the new li
brary site.
To-day one of her strongest advocates
was Mrs. R. P. Gleason, recognized as her
most powerful opponent for the presi
dency. Mrs. Gleason declared that she
was "eager to be a layman again, for she
has much work apart from, the Ebell to
do and she dissuaded not a few from cast-
Ing their votes scattering In order that
Mrs. Bulkley might poll a large majority.
The remainder of the ticket Is as fol
lows: Vice presidents. Miss Mabel Gray,
Mrs. J. W. Musser; recording secretary,
Mrs. Frederick Allardt; correspondingsec
retary, Mrs. E. C. Sessions; financial sec
retary. Mrs. J. W. McClymonds; treas
urer, Mrs. L.. S. Burchard; general cura
tor, Mrs. J. R. Scupham; assistant secre
tary, Mrs. M. C. Chapman.

PROBLEM TO BE
APPOINTMENT OR
OPEN PRIMARIES
Third District Committee
Will Meet During
. . Next Week.
George "W. Reed Favors Appointment
Because Committee Has No
Funds â Dr. Pardee Has Not
Taken Time to Think.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
HIS Broadway, April 13.
The Republican Congressional Commit
tee of the Third District will meet the lat
ter part of next week, probably Saturday,
when the matter or' selecting delegates
to the Republican State Convention will
be discussed. Under the instructions of
the National committee and the action of
the State committee the Congressional
committee becomes a very important body
instead of the rather supernumary organi
zation that it has always been. But what
it has gained in importance is offset by
the added responsibility, for everybody is
now waiting to see what it will do toward
the selecting of delegates to the State
convention.
This interest and responsibility Is
doubled because of the probable contest
between Dr. George C. Pardee and George
W. Reed for delegate-at-large to the Re
publican National Convention.
Though ihe instruct'ons of the National
committee provide that "delegates must
be selected in the same manner as dele
gates %re selected to a Congressional con
vention." there is a great deal of talk of
an appointed delegation. Some of the
members favor appointment upon the
ground that they have no funds to carry
on a primary.
On the other hand It is urged that an
appointed delegation, when there are two
candidates expecting support, would be
unfair. The strict interpretation of the
instructions of the National committee,
even those in favor of appointment say,
admits of no debate, and appointment is
urged on the ground of expediency and in
ability to meet primary expenses.
George W. Reed, who is at once chair
man of the Congressional committee and
a candidate for delegate-at-large to the
National Republican Convention, made
the following statement of his position:
"I do not know, and no one knows, what
the Congressional committee will do about
calling the election for the selection of
delegates to the State convention. There
are six members outside of Alameda
County and their opinions will have to be
consulted. As for myself. I am frank to
say that I favor the appointment of dele
gates as the matter now stands. It will
cost not less than $600 to hold an open
primary, and 1 do not see who will pay
this money. The Congressional commit
tee has not a cent, and I hardly think
that the candidates for delegates will pay
the money."
Dr. George C. Pardee, who Is accepted as
a candidate against George W. Reed,
though he has made no formal announce
ment of his position, would not express an
opinion as between primaries and appoint-
CHINESE WOMAN
SMUGGLED OUT
OF COURTROOM
Determined Effort to Prevent
Kern Quey From Being
Deported.
Sensational Sequel to the Examina
tion of Her Alleg-ed Abductor.
Recaptured After a Long
Chase.-
A sensational Fccne was enacted at
Mayfield yesterday at the close of the
preliminary examination of Wong Fong,
Â¦censed 'of abducting Kern Cjuey, the
pretty Chinese damsel, from her home
:n this city.
Just before the defendant was bound
over to the Superior Court Dr. Gardner,
inspector of the Chinese Bureau, ascer
tained that the woman had been brought
into the country by fraudulent means,
and. accosting her, demanded her certili
ci.tt. She replied that she did not have
one, and was immediately placed under
arrest. Just then Attorney Herrington,
who represented her alleged abductor, re
quested Gardner to interpret the testi
mony of a Chinese witness who was the
last to be examined. Gardner at first de
murred, suspecting something wrong, but
as the constable consented to keep a
strict guard over the woman he finally
agreed.
While the inspector was translating the
testimony of the Chinese witness word
reached him that an attempt was to be
made to get the woman out of the juris
diction cl the courts of Santa Clara
County. He immediately consulted with
a drnggist named Hall, who has a store
in Mayneld. and who has taken an active
interest in the prosecution of the abduc
tor, with ihe result thai Hall prorji.sed to
look out for the woman until Gardner
had finished his task. Evidently aware
that the scheme to abduct the woman had
been discovered, the constable asked.
Gardner if he had a warrant for her ar
rest.
"I arrest her in the name of the United
StatÂ«." replied the inspector. "It is not
necessary for me to have a warrant."
After the Chinese witness had finished
his testimony Gardner went to look for
the woman, and was surprised to find her
missing from the ante-room In which he
supposed she was safe from the gang
of conspirators. Seeing Attorney J. N. E.
Wilson of this city standing outside of
the courtroom, he asked him what had
become of the woman. Wilson pleaded
Ignorance and made an ineffectual at
tempt to delay Gardner in his pursuit of
the woman and her abductors. Hastily
eecuring a double ttam Gardner, accom
panied by Druggist Hall, started out to j
head off the conspirators and their charge, j
From a smaJl boy the inspector learned
that the woman, accompanied by two
Chinos- and Attorney Herrington, had
passed in a double rig only a short time i
before and were heading for San Jose, j
Gardner whipped up his horse and soon, J
caught sight of the quartet driving tu
riouxly along a crossroad. As the pur
suers drew near Herrington. evidently be
coming alarmed for his own safety,
jumped out of the vehicle. Without wait
ins to arrfst him Gardner continued the
pursuit of the rig in which was seated the
woman, overhauling it after a short but
epeedy drive. The woman was then
:>k. b into custody, and at once brought
t<. ihis city. A mysterious woman. wear-
ing eye-glasses, accompanied her on the
trip and seemed particularly solicitous
about htr welfare. She refused to give
her name, and the inspector concluded
that she was a sister (it Attorney Herr
rington. She insisted on going to the
County Jail with the Chinese woman, and
seemed determined not to leave her even.
V- ri r a moment.
Q At the request of Gardner Kern Quey j
afterward transferred to the City !
Prison, still followed by the mysterious ;
woman in black. After the prisoner had
teen placed in charge of the matron. Cap
tain Seymour ordered the strange woman
out of the prison. She reluctantly obeyed,
announcing that she would return this
morning and dpfy the prison officials to
separate her from the Chinese woman.
Kern Quey is one of the many wo
men who have been allowed to enter the
country without a certificate. It Is the
intention of Inspector Gardner to have
her deported.

Joseph Maristany Does Not
Care if Wife Never
Comes Back.
Madame Harbidge Thinks Alameda
Is Slow and Only Fit for Church
and Sunday-School Peo
ple to Live In.
ALAMEDA, April 13.â Five month 3 ago
Joseph Maristany, the aged capitalist,
married Mrs. Annette Frelmann, whose
business name is.Mme. Harbidge. On the
19th of last month Mrs. Maristany went
East, ostensibly to visit her mother at
Marion, Ind. Now Maristany has discov
ered that his wife left him debts of 13000
and that- she never intends to return to
him. To a friend in Alameda she wrote
that Alameda. is too slow for her and only
lit for church and Sunday-school people to
live, in, adding that she . was going to
Cape Nome in the spring.
Mme. Harbidge came to Alameda In No
vember last and opened the Alameda
Cloak and Suit House, locating in one of
Maristany's stores at the corner of Oak
street and Alameda avenue. Maristany;
officiating as his own rent collector, met
the lady often and soon fell desperately
in love with her. She saw an opportunity
to save rent and when he proposed mar
riage acquiesced. They were married se
cretly and it was a month afterward be
fore the news leaked out. â¢
For a while Mr. and Mrs. Maristany
were happy, but by and by they began
to fight and famllv rows were frequent.
One night in the Park Hotel Maristany
threatened to throw his wife downstairs
and the police quelled the disturbance.
Seemingly Mrs. "Maristany-Harbidge"
prospered in business, however, and she
had any amount of patronage in Alameda,
employing as many as sixteen girls and
men at one time. When she proposed a
month ago to go East to visit her mother
and recover her health there was ncr one
to say her nay and her aged husband
helped her pack her things. The cloak
house was closed and Maristany was
given book accounts to collect and bills
to pay, amounting to about $5000.
"My wife left me the books, which
showed these accounts to collect and that
all bills had been paid," said Maristany
to-day. "Now I find that the book ac
counts have all been paid and none of the
bills against my wife have been settled.
They amount to $5000. My wife wrote me
nice letters after she left, but lately I
have not received any. I don't care if she
never comes back. She has cost me too
much. money already.".
Maristany's experience in matrimony
has been a costly one since his first wife
died in an insane asylum four years ago.
After two years as a widower he married
Mrs. Caroline Sperry, who. besides secur
ing a divorce after a short wedded life,
managed to secure about $25,000 of his
property, which she now holds.

RARE OLD BIBLE IS FOUND.
Antiquarian of Florence Discovers the
Volume in the Archives of an
Old Family.
A wonderful old Bible has Just been dis
covered in Venice, the fortunate finder be
ins Leo S. Olschkl, a well-known antiqua
rian of Florence. It is In five large vol
umes and was printed In Rome in the
printing-house of Don Pietro Massimo in
1471 and 1472. Soon after it came from the
press it was purchased by a patrician fam
ily of Venice, and It was In the archives
of this family that Olschki discovered it.
The edition of which it forms a part is
exceedingly rare, and large sums have
been paid for Imperfect copies of this
Bible. Olschkl paid 5400 lire ten years ago
for a copy of which two volumes were
missing, and a library in Berlin recently
osktd 13.000 lire for a mutilated copy. The
copy Just discovered Is probably the finest
in the world, and 30,000 lire was readily
paid for it by a buyer, who is supposed to
represent a wealthy American.â New York

A QUESTION TOR DOCTORS.
Should a Patient Be Told That He Is
Beyond BecoveryP
Whether a doctor should tell a dying
patient, or one whom he believes to be
dying, that his case is hopeless is a ques
tion that has been brought before medical
and clerical men by the decision in a re
cent suit. The learned Judge said that a
physician who knew his patient's case
was hopeless and failed to tell him so was
guilty of a breach of trust.
"But," the doctors ask, "when Is a phy
sician to know absolutely that his patient
is certain to die?" They point out the
factâ no less well known to the layman
than to the physicianâ that many recov
eries have resulted In cases that seemed
absolutely hopeless; and, on the other
hand, that many cases which did not
seem in the leapt to be serious had fatal
terminations. "How, then." they ask. "Is
a physician or anybody else to say posi
tively that this man is going to die or
that man Is going to get well? In ninety
nine care- the man who to the physician
appears to be dying will die. but Is it not
well to consider that possibly every case
Is the one hundredth and to take every
precaution against doing anything which
will weaken the slender cord by which
life hangs?"
AH physicians, and. in fact, all people
who know much of sick people, declare
that hone and confidence that" he wul re
cover are most necessary things on the
part of a patient. They declare will
power and a desire to live are very es
sential aids to medical or surgical treat
ment. They point out the fact that a man
who wants to pet well and thinks he Is
going to get well will take the treatment
that his physician prescribes, but that as
soon as hope Is gone he gives up: he re
fuses to take treatment: he considers the
battle lost and refuses to continue the
fight.
Physicians *ay they realize the neces
sity of giving the sick man every oppor
tunity to arrange hiÂ« affairs so th<Â«y will
be left In perfect order at his dmth and
also for giving ample warning of the pos
sibility or probability of death to oermit
of his reception of th? lost spiritual rites
but they say this can bÂ«Â» done, by giving
thÂ«Â» warning to the family and not neces
Â«Â»Hiy to the sick man.
The tenaHty with which a s!ck nerson
clings to life Is no less marked In one
avemge case than another, according to
tv.<Â» doctors. ThÂ« "Id man or woman is as
nnrlous tw remain an atom In the life of

HER LIFE BLASTED
BY MORPHINE HABIT
, t.
OAKLAND, April 13.â Mrs. Julia J. Dur
ran of San Lfandro. a victim of the mor
phine habit, was consigned to the asylum
for thÂ»Â» insane at Stockton to-day by
Judge Ogden on recommendation of Drs.
Knox and Sanborn. The drug has grad
ually undermined the woman's mind un
til she now imagines that she is being
constantly pursued by countless numbers i
of huge frogs. On several occasions the 1
unfortunate woman has procured a knife j
and threatened to kill her husband if he
did not protect her from her imaginary
bactrachian pursuers.
"Good-fcye Papa."
There were few dry eyes in the court-
room when the commission returned
their verdict of "insanity," and the un-
fortunate man seemed to realize the
gravity of his situation as the heart-
broken wife bade bim farewell. As the
officers started to lead him from the
room his little daughter came to him
and reaching up her chubby arms
around his neck. Between her con-
vulsive sobs came the pathetic words,
"Good-bye, papa; I guess. l'll never see
you any more."
The mental breakdown which settled
as a pall over this once happy family
came after years of concentrated ner-
vous strain and overwork had sapped
the brain- and nerves of their vitality.
How different might have been the end-
ing had that fond father known what
Mr. George H. Howard of Marshall,
111., knows to-day. Mr. Howard says:
"The first trouble I noticed was in-
ability to sleep, followed by general
weakness, which continued until I had
to be taken to and from my store in a
carriage. Finally I had to give up, and
for five months was confined to the
house with an attendant night and day.
For seventeen days and nights I never
closed my eyes in sleep. I was taken
to a private asylum, but in a few days
they brought me back again to die. A
friend brought me a bottle of Dr. Miles'
Nervine and persuaded me to try it.
After taking one-half the contents I
began to get some sleep, and when I
had used three bottles I was able to
return to my store. Had I taken the
nervine in the first place I would have
been spared months of agonizing tor-
ture and an expense of nearly $2000."
Dr. Miles' Nervine is sold at all
druggists on a positive guarantee.

MILE A MINUTE
The spot in the Swiss Alps that attracts
the winter sportsmen of Europe is the
Cresta Run, at St. Moritz.i which is just
one mile in length. The tobogganing sea
son here begins about the middle of No
vember, when the first snow falls. The
condition of the run is not left to chance,
but the slide is prepared undtr the direc
tion of a committee.
SÂ»vis3 toboggans In contrast to the Can
adian ones, made entirely of wood, are
raised on runners shod with iron or st^el.
The expert rider lies prone upon the to
boggan, head foremost, both hands grasp
ing the framework at the sides and both
feet employed in steering. Iron spikes are
secured to the toes of the boots, and by
trailing one or the other foot along the
ground the big sled may be guided.
But as this fashion of steering tends to
diminish the speed the most skillful riders
use the feet as little as possible and de
pend upon shifting the position.
Though the Cresta Run Is a mile In
length the whole distance may be made In
seventy seconds. At the steepest point a
mile a minute is made.â New York "World.

Promoter.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, April 13.â Lawrence G.
Skancke of the "Guarantee Loan and
Trust Company," so-called, has come
down off his high horse and is In a suppli
cating mood.
"We are not doing any business at pres
ent," said he. "and will not until the Chi
cago courts decide whether It is a lottery
we are conducting. Why do you fellows
hound me and dig up my record? I am
only an employe and will lose my job if
Jones Is convicted."
It will be noticed that Skancke's tone
has moderated somewhat. Last week he
was defiant and offensive. It Is under
stood that Anthony Comstock has copies
of The Call containing the expose of the
lottery scheme and thinks of arresting
Skancke.

BERNARD MOSES
BADE FAREWELL
BY STUDENTS
Grand Rally of Men and
Women in" Front of Li
brary Building.
Judge Taft and President Wheeler
Advise Young People to Work
Hard and Earnestly at
Their Callings.
BERKELEY, April 13.â Judge W. H.
Taft. president of the Philippine Commis
sion; President Benjamin Ide Wheeler
and Professor Bernard Moses addressed
the students of the University of Califor
nia this morning. A platform had been
erected at the base of the flag pole in
front of the library building, and around
that fully a thousand men and women
students assembled. The rally was In the
nature of a farewell to Professor Moses,
who has been appointed on the Philippine
Commission. Professor Mosea was greet
ed with cheers and college yells by the
students, as was also Judge Taft. Presi
dent Wheeler said:
"I want to use this opportunity when
I have bo many of you before me to say
Just a word about the very Interesting
subject of rushing. I have been very
fond of rushing myself. My experience
in the matter dates from my connection
with a small college, and I recognize the
fact that rushing is out of date, that it
Is relegated to the life of the small col
lege. All progressive universities that
have grown out of their swaddling
clothes nave given up the practice of
promiscuous rushing. "We are going to
see if the old-fashioned rush can be re
duced to a game of rules."
Judge Taft was then introduced and
said:
"Your president said I need only say
a word expressing my pleasure in being
here. But there Is one other word I
should like to say. I do not know that
it will be useful because it doubtless has
been already impressed upon you; but
the older I grow there Is one thought that
Impresses itself upon me with respect to
success in life and thatyl suppose you
are all Interested now to consider. When
you get out of the university and go into
the work which you are to do. don't be
at all careful of limiting your energy
to a narrow path. If you happen to be
employed as a clerk act as If you owned
the store and do the work as if you
meant to have the whole enterprise suc
cessful."
Professor Moses said:
"I am not going' to sever my connection
with the university, but simply going to
engage in a little work in connection
with university extension. Owing to cer
tain perilous conditions of civilization in
a certain part of the country which now
seems to belong to us, educational af
fairs are in a somewhat uncertain condi
tion and need looking after, and therefore
the university is sending out one of its
members to have something to do in ar
ranging the educational system of that
part of the country. I appreciate more
than I can tell you at this time the cour
tesy and good will that have been shown
me during my connection with the univer
sity."

BATHOS TURNED
THE TABLES ON
A WARM CHOICE
Downed Dr. Nembula, Caus
ing Owner Moran to
Be Suspended.
Favorites at Tanforan Finally Took
a Hand in the Game â Gaylon
Brown a Winner IâTheory1 â The
ory Scores.
There have been many and merry re
versals of form at Tanforan Park, but
the pirouette somersault performed by
the three-year-old Bathos yesterday
eclipsed all previous efforts in that line.
It was a genuine twister, calling down
the wrath of the stand on his owner. On
Thursday, when a 1 to 4 favorite, the
Montana colt was disgracefully beaten,
with Ross up, by both Maydine and Ur
chin. To be sure, some changes had oc
curred over night. The track had dried
out considerably, the odds lengthened and
Henry replaced Ross. In the last event,
at odds of 5 to 1, Bathos went out and In
a drive defeated the 1 to 3 favorite. Dr.
Nembula. The improvement shown was
so sudden the judges suspended Owner
J. J. Moran pending an investigation.
For a change five favorites secured win
ning brackets. The crowd In the ring was
again very small.
Gaylon Brown, a mild favorite In the
betting, defeated a bunch of eleven
maiden two-year-olds in the opening
scramble. Badly bumped at the stretch
turn by Illilouon, the youngster recovered
quickly, winning almost easily from Graf
ter and Loyal S.
Dan Honig'3 mare Theory, heavily
backed at short odds, led from the start
in the six-furlong sprint following. At the
wire she led the 100 to 1 shot Beaumonde
out several lengths. Afghan finished
third.
Oremus, the Ormonde-Santa Cruz filly,
started for the first time this season In
the five-furlong sprint and was installed
a 7 to 10 choice. Ridden out, the favorite
was hustled along to beat the 30 to 1 shot
Ahwahnee. Show honors went to Garbo.
The betting on Perseus, one of five start
ers in the mile and a sixteenth run,
seemed so nervous and fretful that the
Judges substituted Henry for Ross Just
before post time. Purser's gelding then
went out and made all the running, losing
the verdict by a nose only to the favorite,
Scotch Plaid.
With a stronger finisher in the saddle
Montallade, a 12 to 1 shot, would have
taken the fifth number. While Johnson
handled the outsider well, Ross astride
the favorite, Casdale, had a "shade" when
it came to a drive, earning the verdict by
a neck. Obsidian, at 15 to 1, ran third.

DENVER, April 13.â Benny Yanger.
the "Ttpton Slasher," put out Young
Corbett of this city in the eighth round of
what was to have been a ten-round go
before the Colorado Athletic Association
here to-day. Yanser was far the clever
er, but found Corbett strong and able to
withstand his onslaughts. Yanger used
his left mostly until the eighth round,
when a right swing on the head and a
right punch to the chin floored Corbett.
He remained down nine seconds. Another
right to the chin floored him again. Cor
bett'strugtrled to his feet and Yanger put
another right punch* to the face, which

At the meeting of the regatta committee
of the Pacific Association of the Amateur
Athletic Union held last night President
J. R. Bockman stated that he had had
an interview with T. V. Klngton of the
Boating Association of the University of

tators will attend the ladies' day and that

OFFICER FELD
MEETS WITH
BIG SURPRISE
Charges Have Been Pre
ferred Against Him by
Captain Wittman.
Chief Sullivan and the Captain Found
Him Drinking in a Saloon With
an Extra Good Looking
Girl.
. Policeman Joseph Feld is not an old
member of the force, and since he has had
the distinction of wearing a star he has
been under the Impression tmat a patrol
man's life is a happy one, consisting
chiefly of spending most of his time In
saloons Instead of on his beat. Complaints
had been frequently made against him,
but he was always fortunate in not being
caught. :
A few night 3 ago Chief Sullivan and
Captain Wittman were in the Western
Addition inspecting saloons to see if the
partitions of the boxes complied with the
law in not being over six feet In height.
While examining one of the saloons Cap
tain Wittman heard a voice that sounded
familiar. He quietly opened the door and
beckoned to the Chief. Seated at a table
with a pretty girl and two glasses of beer
was Policeman Feld. Feld and the girl
sat with their backs toward the door, and
they were laughing and having a good
The Chief and captain stood quietly at
the open door awaiting developments. In
a minute or two Feld turned around, and
his face was a study as his eyes fell upon
the stern countenances of his superior of
ficers. Feld was in full uniform, and his
beat was on Ashbury Heights, about six
blocks away. ,
"Is this the way you patrol your beat?
sternly asked Wittman.
Feld was too confused to make a reply,
but muttered something and slunk out of
the saloon, followed by the girl, who
seemed to feel the awkwardness of the
situation as much as the dlscomntea of
"charges have been filed with the Police
Commissioners by Captain Wittman
against Feld for belnc absent from his
beat and for unomcerllke conduct. The
case will come up before the Commission
ers at their meeting Tuesday night.

Headache may be called a woman's
ailment. Some men suffer from it. But
almost all women have to endure its pain
â¢with each recurring month. This fact
points at once to the intimate relation
between the health of the delicate
womanly organs, and the general health
of the whole body. Dr.-Pierce's Favor-
ite Prescription banishes headache by
banishing its cause. - It cures the dis-
eases which irritate the delicate womanly
organs, fret the nerves and waste the
strength. It increases the vitality and

Truman Seeks a Compromise.
Attorney I. J. Truman Jr. yesterday
filed a petition In the Superior Court ask
ing leave to compromise his claim against
Charles S. Coggins and wife as guardians
of the late Carrie Sankey. Some month 3
before her death Miss Sankey assigned
one-half of her estate to Mr. Truman in
consideration of his agreement to prose
cute her suit against Mr. Coggins and. his
wife to recover property valued at $46,000,
which she alleged, she deeded to the de
fendants under undue influence. After a
long trial Judgment was rendered by
Judge Bahrs. In which he held that the
title vested In Mr. Copgins was 1 invalid
and ordered that the property should be
reconveyed to the plaintiff. Recently
Miss Sankey died, and now Mr. Truman
asks that the court confirm his offer of
compromise, awarding him $2700 in full
satisfaction of his claim against the es
tate, although his judgment claim against
the same amounts to over $20,000.

FATHER YORKE TELLS
STORY OF THE PASSION
Says Sufferings of the Lord Axe but
an Epitome of Human
Life.
The "Story of the Passion" was the sub
ject of Rev. Father Yorke's sermon at St.
Peter's Church last night. He explained
that the whole history of the world was
a continuation of the passion of the
blessed Lord, and that his terrible suf
ferings were but an epitome of human
life.
â¢â¢The passion is not a figment of the
dreamer's imapination or a poetic
thought." said Father Yorke. "but it was
a terrible reality. The sufferings endured
by the divine Favior for the many lniqui
tiVs of man were so acute that when he
etood in the Garden of Gcthsemane, on
the Mount of Olives, he cried out in the
agony of death. 'O. my Father, if it be
possible let this chalice of sorrow pass
from me. it is too bitter.' The momentary
weakness passed away, however, for he
realized that the salvation of erring man
was to be wrought by him."

COMMISSIONERS
RECEIVE THEIR
INSTRUCTIONS
President McKinley Sends a
Special Messenger From
Washington.
>
Judge Taft and His Colleagues Hold
an Important Meeting â General
Secretary Has Not Yet
Been Selected.
There was an Important meeting of the
Philippine Commission In the rooms of
Jadjre Taft at the Palace Hotel yesterday
afternoon. In the morning a special mes
senger arrived from Washington with
sealed instructions from President Mc-
Kinley to the commission. So important
was his mission that the press represen
tatives at Washington did not learn of
his departure from that city, and even
now his Identity is not known.
As soon as possible Judge Taft sent for
his colleagues, and a.t 3 o'clock Commis
sioners Wright, lde, Moses and Worces
ter met In his apartments. The Instruc
tions were read by Judge Taft and gen
erally discussed by the members of the
commission until dinner time. The meet
ing was executive. After it was over
Judge Taft was seen and asked for a copy
cf the instructions.
"Obviously," he said. "I am not In a po
sition to make any disclosures In regard
to our insi ructions. If they are to be
made public President McKinley is the
man to do it. I can say nothing."
At yesterday afternoon's meeting candi
dates for the position of general secretary
of the commission were, again discussed,
but no selection was made. Judge Taft
paid afterward that in all probability no
selection would be male until the Com
missioners have reached Manila.
A. W. Ferguson, the Planish secretary,
arrived yesterday from VÂ»'ashington, and
his assistant, F. C. Dominguez or Los An
geles is also in the city. Mr. Ferguson
ected as interpreter for the Paris Peace
Commission. He resigned the position of
Chief Translator of the Bureau of Ameri
can Republics at Washington in order to '
accept a position under the Philippine
Commissioners. Mr. Dominguez is well
known in the southern part of the State :
as an expert interpreter.
J. W. Brannigran, the distributing olHcer
of the commission, is also at the Palace. ;
He held the same office under the Paris
Peace Commission, and resigned the posi
tion of distributing officer for the Depart
ment of State at Washington in order to
accompany the Philippine Commissioners.
General Shafter announced to the Com
missioners yesterday that he had ar
ranged for them to sail on the transport
Hancock at noon Tuesday. On Monday
General Shafter has invited Ju.lge Taft
and his colleagues to lunch with him Â£t
the Pacific-rninn Club.

SOUGHT DEATH TO END
HER LIFE OF SHAME
Rose Reaves Is the Name of the Girl
Who Attempted Suicide in
the Park. :
ROSE REAVES Is the name of *V t^^ip I*^.1 *^.
the girl who tried to commit W'^^C HjOT^Uffitvitft^ib'
suicide early yesterday morning
was for a short time previous to the ( wV,^OTmi\\\\M\\WM^^
time she tried to end it all an inmate S VivfldJfflJ *fi l\\\u\w\\\\\WS^w\
of a house at 322 Mason street. Pre- R'mV^^H! MIUUMwWWw^Hfc
viously she had Jived in other houses V* (j '^Â§3 fill VM\WZL-mE&fflSr'
of ill repute, and on one occasion lately 'X^flj^MLUuj iU^M|ntBBHHP^
attempted suicide by taking: poison.
It is the same sorrowful old taleâ '^"""""'""^3^'^
the sudden realization of the awfulness
of a life of shame, deep, bitter, repent- MISS ROSE REAVES,
ance and then a longing for the
oblivion of death. The poor unfortunate refused to divulge her name or
residence when brought to the Receiving Hospital yesterday morning. She
called herself "Helen Grey," but afterward admitted that the name was
assumed and told conflicting tales of a lonely, loveless life, without home,
relatives or friends.
"I'm not clever," she said, "and so cannot adopt any profession by
means of which I might earn a living. In a store I would get $3 a week,
and I could not live on that. I am not strong enough to do hard work and
in no way am fitted to look after myself. Death was the only thing."
Last evening, when she was told that her identity was no longer a
matter of conjecture and that her name was Rose Reaves, she reluctantly
admitted the sad truth. ~'i:':?
"It was an awful life," she moaned. "It was killing me by Inches and
death seemed the only way out of it all." ;'}>,:/-
And that Is all Rose Reaves would say. Not. one word to explain how
an apparently refined, well educated, beautiful young woman forsook the
narrow, blessed path for the broad and thorny one.
Rose Reaves was resting quietly last evening and there is every hope of
her ultimate recovery. The poor girl is apparently about 20 years of age,
pretty, attractive and refined, and bears none of the earmarks of the terrible
life she has been leading. Early yesterday morning a messenger brought the
girl a note, which proved to be the. effusion of a crank. It was signed "A
Gentlemen," and read aa follows, bad spelling and all:
April 13.
Miss Helen Grayâ Dear Maddam: If you are In want of .a friend please answer this

Kahn and mother of Congressman Julius
Kahn, passed away yesterday at her late
residence, 1426 Geary street. The news of
her death was received with deep sorrow
by her friends, as she was kindly thought
of by all who knew her.

Louis, Emil. Adolph. Charles and Re
becca Kahnâ survive her.

Germany, and at the time of her death
was nearly 63 years old. Her distinguished

is hurrying to* this city for tho purpose of
paying his last respects to the dead. The
funeral will be held to-morrow from the
late residence, and interment will be in
Home of Peace Cemetery.
GOOD FRIDAY OBSERVED
IN MANY CITY CHURCHES
Customary Services Betokening the
Solemn Season Held by Catho
lics' and Protestants.
Good Friday was duly solemnized In this
city yesterday. Processions of little chil
dren clad 1 In white went to the Catholic
churches, and the customary ceremonies
of the season were observed. The history
of Christ's passion and death was chanted
as given in the gospel of St. John. Solemn
prayers' were said j for all mankind. In
the evening Â¦ there were sermons on the
death of Christ. The exercises of the ven
eration of the cross took place during the
day. There was no mass celebrated, as
the priests and all the dignitaries of the
church are assembled in spirit around Cal
vary on Good Friday, and that is the only
day in the year when; mass is not- said.
The season, also was .observed by the
Episcopalian churches, and there were
several special services.

The State Central Committee of the
People's party met at the California
Hotel yesterday aXternoon and appointed

tional convention of Populists at Sioux

Any other kind of a party than the
Bryan Populists would deem the proceed
ings of yesterday's session as decidedly
irregular and somewhat grotesque. Only
ten members of the entire committee were
present. It was said that other members
sufficient to make a quorum of the State
Central Committee were represented by
proxy, but the secretary did not unfold
the written evidence of proxy representa
tion to the newspaper scribes.
The session was secret, but the fact was
disclosed that the actual attendants were:
E. S. Van Meter, Fresno; Fred Brown,
San Jose; H. W. Wood, Sacramento; W.
P. Netherton, Santa Cruz; C. A. Barlow,
San Luis Obtepo; H. A. Mason, Santa
Clara; Henry Huppert, J. W. Reay, Wil
liam Meekin and A. B. Kinne, San Fran
rlsco. The chairman of the meeting was
K. S. Van Meter. A. B. Kinne acted as
secretary-
George A. Clough of San Francisco and
George W. Monteith of Marin were on the
outside. Mr. Clough. it appears, had a
right to participate in the so-called de
liberations. He was about to exercise his
right, when the doorkeeper denied him
admission to the room. There was no up
roar over the exclusion. Mr. dough
was simply advised that a committee was
considering whether or not he should be
admitted. Pending the report of the com
mittee the chair ruled that the insiders,
having paid the rent of the rooms, had
the right to admit or exclude any one at
their pleasure.
Mr. Clouph had no one to appeal to ex
cept Monteith and the newspaper report
ers. After all the business was transacted
and the adjournment announced the com
mittee on Clough's case reported in favor
of his admission.
Some time ago Mr. Clough rendered
himself unpopular by asking leading ques
tions concerning the disbursement of
campaign money. The manner of his in
quiry conveyed the impression that 'he
suspected that some of the money had
been squandered or stolen. 1,. -' '.
Superior Judge Lawlor. a well-known
Bryan Democrat, was behind the scenes
of yesterday's performance. When mem
bers of the committee were In doubt as
to the manner of proceeding a delegate
was detailed to interview the Judge. The
latter readily gave the advice' sought. It
was suggested that he had a supply of
oil for the political machine, as every
thing worked with remarkable smooth
ness after the consultations.
The thirty-six delegates appointed yes
terday were not instructed, but it was
not difficult to elicit the expression that
they are for Bryan. A resolution was
adopted authorizing the delegates attend
ing: the national convention to cast . the
vote of absentee members. Authority to
use proxies was denied.
The Populists attending yesterday's
session represent one faction of the Peo
ple's party. The other faction, known as
Middle of the Road Populists, will meet
later on and send delegates to a national
convention to assemble at Cincinnati,
Ohio, May 9. Mr. Monteith figures that
a majority of all the State Central Com
mittee favors the plan of sending dele
gates to the Ohio convention. The out
and-out Bryan Populists swear that the
South Dakota convention is the only real
thing and that the Cincinnati affair is but
a Dewey side show.
The Bryan Populists report that they
will not take steps toward the nomination
of Presidential Electors and members of
Congress until next August. The subject
matter in this respect was yesterday re
ferred to the executive committee. The
developments indicated that fusion with
the Democrats on the Presidential elec
toral ticket is in comtemplation.
It is said among the politicians that Seth
Mann will soon Issue a call for a meeting
of the Democratic State Central Commit
tee to arrange for an early convention at
Sacramento. The hint has already been
passed to the "insiders" that delegates to
the State convention will be appointed.
It Is known that the members of the Dem
ocratic County Committee will not enter
tain a proposition to hold primaries to
elect delegates, as they are convinced that
the masses of the party would rush to the'
polls and cast their votes to rebuke Phe
lan. The indignation In the party caused
by the weakness and corruption of the
Phelan administration overshadows the
national issue. The political managers
must therefore resort to some scheme to
keep Phelan out of sight.
It is well understood that ex-Senator
White. Jasper McDonald and James G.
Maguire desire to attend the Kansas City
Convention as delegates at large. Ross
Clarke of Los Angeles, brother of the
Montana Senator. Clarke. Is spoken of as
a probable candidate for delegate at
large.
Fourth District Bepublicans.
The Fourth Congressional District Re
publican Committee met at Pythian Cas
tle last evening and adjourned without
transacting any business. Members of
the committee have resolved to wait
awhile to see what course the Fifth Con
gressional Republican Committee will
take In regard to primary elections In San
Francisco. Early next week Max Gold
berg, chairman, will call a meeting of the
committee In the Fifth.
South End Republicans.
At a regular meeting of the South End
Republican Club last night the following
named delegates were elected to the Los
Angeles convention of the Republican
League of Clubs: A. B. Spreckels. George
Stone, H. B. Russ. George A. Donoghue,
Henry McMahon, T. J. Sullivan and J. F.
McGlynn.
Thirty-Second.
The Thirty-second Assembly District
Republican League met last evening and
elected the following delegates to the Los
Angeles convention: Dr. T. Byron de
Witt, J. W. Capus, C. W. Taylor and W.
D. Getchell.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL. 14, 1900,
BARK CHENEY ON
FIRE AT HOWARD
STREET MOORING
Mysterious Blaze in Cargo
Startles Watchman in
Charge.
Fireboat and Several Engines Pour
Streams of Water Into the
"Vessel's Hold for
Hours.
The bark B. P. Cheney was discovered
to be on fire as she lay at Howard-street
wharf No. 1 last night by H. Bergendahl,
the watchman on board.. The bark was
about to sail with a cargo of supplies for
the canneries of the Alaska Packers' As
sociation in Alaska.
Bergendahl and the cabin boy were the
only ones on board of the bark. They both
saw smoke issuing from the hold at about
10 o'clock. Bergendahl ran up the dock
until he met Dr. Morrison of the Receiv
ing Hospital. Dr. Morrison rang In an
alarm from Howard and Spear streets,
and five "engines responded. The fireboat
Governor Irwin also ran alongside the
bark, and soon there were eight streams
of water pouring into the hold of the ves
sel, to which the fire seemed to be con
fined.
Only when the hatch was first taken off
was there any flash of light, and that was
smothered in an instant by the first
stream of water that struck the cargo.
For hours the fire smoldered in the ves
sel. The cargo included a lot of boxing
materials, which burned freely.
At midnight the fire-fighters had the fire
under control. Several holes had been cut
through the decks of the bark In order
that the streams of water might have a
wider range. Frank Peterson, the agent
of the vessel, arrived after a time.- and
also the master of the bark. Captain
Charles Johnson, but they were unable to
estimate the loss. The vessel and cargo
were insured, but they could not say for
what amount.
At the bow cf the Cheney the ship Ta
coma was moored. All hands were on
board and they manifested a lively inter
est in the proceedings. The loss to the
vessel will probably be small. The cargo
must be badly damaged. The origin of
the fire Is a mystery. .-> Â¦:Â¦ . Â¦â¢<
