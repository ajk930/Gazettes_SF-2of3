REINSTATEMENT OF
MRS. WHEELER ORDERED
Must Be Restored to Her Old Posi
tion in the Boise Post
offlce.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOISE, Idaho. April 13.â The contro
versy between Postmaster Fentoa and
the Civil Service Commission and the
Postofflca Department over the dismissal
of Mrs. Jennie Wheeler has eventuated
in the department permanently re
instating Mrs. Wheeler and ordering the
dismissal of Chief Clerk E. J. Sencerbox,
a warm friend of the Postmaster. As
Sencerbox was not In the classified serv
ice, the department doer not have to
make the charges against him public, but
they are understood to be very serious.
It is said that one of them is that he
opened a letter sent to Mrs. Hamilton,
the notorious woman who was largely re
sponsible for the downfall of Auditor and
Recorder Lamoreaux.
Mrs. Wheeler was ordered reinstated
some time ago. but the Postmaster as
signed her to a position she could not fill.
In reinstating her in her old position h<?
has requested that she be on duty con
tinuously from 6 a. m. to 7 p. m. and she
will appeal to the Civil Service Commis
sion. The postofflce row has cre
ated something of a sensation
here. and it is said the Post
master is liable to find himselr In
serious trouble before long because of his
practical defiance of the authorities al
most unprecedented in the history of th<Â»
civil service, and it Is doubtful If the
Poatofflce Department ever ran across a'
more stubborn customer.

GAS MAIN EXPLODES
WITH FATAL RESULTS
One Man Is Instantly Killed and
Five Others Are Seriously
Injured.
LOGANSPORT. Ind.. April 15.â T00
much pressure and a piece of defective
gas pipe in the mains of the Chicago Pipe
Line Company at a point four miles south
east of here was the cause of a terrific ex
plosion to r day, in which Michael Ellison
Jr. was instantly killed and five other
men received injuries from which it is
doubtful if they will recover. Twelve
men were in the trench repairing a leak
in a ten-Inch main, from which the gas
had been transferred to an eight-inch
main near it. The men were around a
"T" in the eight-inch main, and Ellison
was stooping over it when the pipe ex
ploded. His body was found 150 feet
away. Many "bones were broken and he
probably met instant death.
George Morrison, who was in charge of
the work, was sent sprawling on the
ground thirty feet away with gravel and
dirt blown into his skin. His body was
wrenched and his clothes torn and tat
tered. Will Briggs inhaled gas and was
taken home unconscious. Three laborers
were knocked down and bruised in a
frightful manner. The rest of the men
escaped with slight injuries from flying
dirt and rock. The "T" weighs 1000 pounds
and it was carried a distance of nfty
feet. ' . Â¦ ' '.
The explosion tore the ground for a dis
tance of 400 feetand'was heard' for miles.
Saturday's date,, reiterating his opinion
that the war is bound to prove an expen
sive business. He says:
" Tn-o hundred 'an<3nftj~ thousand nien will be
needed before the end : Is attained. The ques
tion of remounts, will continue one of vital Im
portance. Great, numbers are: now -arriving,
but. owing to the fact that they have to be put
to work before time, is given- them to recover
from; the effects of the ; voyage, their condition
is low and the death' rate among, them high.'
Thousands, j therefore, will be wanted In addi

LONDON. April IS. '-England waits
eagerly for war news, but little
comes. Lord Roberts Is still silent,
but at work. -In "Bloemfontein, and
its immediate" neighborhood the
British army is enjoying a comparatively
quiet Eastertide, . Preparations for. ,the
general advance are being actively pushed
and indications are that Lord Roberts Is
now. able. at a moment's notice to con
centrate an. overwhelming, force against
the Boers to the southeast or wherever
they, may elect, to; make their stand..
The severity of the. recent.- fighting at
Wepener is proved by the reported heavy
casualties sustained by the little garrison
â eighteen killed and 130 wounded. Colonel
Dalgety's men continue to hold their own,
but the Boers, who are surrounding them,
apparently hadnot up to Saturday given
up the siege. .
General Chermside's: division was still
at Reddersb'urgh ion Saturday, but Gen
eral Brabant with the bulk of his force
left Aliwal North that day for Rouxville.
In Cape Town it was | reported yesterday
that the Colonial general engaged . the
Boers and had captured men and guns
near Wepener. It does not seem" likely,
however, that even his quick moving col
umn could, have reached that neighbor
hood In so short a time.
Lord Methuen is still at Boshof, which,
in conjunction with the fact that - the
crossing of ; the Vaal : at Warrenton re
mains in the Boers' hands." would seem
toupset the theory that a column for the
relief of Mafeking has gone north through
Boshof. Thus" the mystery surrounding
the plans of. the military authorities to
reach Baden-Powell remains as dark as
ever. â¢
.All seems quiet In Northern Natal. The

FEVER AT CAPE NOME
Mail- Carrier Brings News of Sickness and
Gold Strikes in the Northern
Mining Camp.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
y, -TTICTORIA, B. C. April 15. -The col
\ / l |er - St - Paul, .which reached the
A / Comox collieries from Kodiak,
1/ . Alaska^ brought down a mail car
. *r rier from - Cape Nome. This car
rier. Loyal L*. Wirt,. is the first man to
come down this season from the new El
Dorado by. the ocean route and the last
who ' left Nome to reach the /.'outside."
Mr. Wirt left Nome City on January 10
with; the Alaska Commercial Company's
mail and had as a companion as far, as
Kodiak, where he found the St., Paul, Cap
tain-Worth, the Alaska Exploration Com
pany's mall carrier. The captain .took a
steamer to Juneau,, and should be down
by one of the Alaskan liners shortly.
They were fifty-three days in making
the trip from Nome to Kodiak, -traveling,
however,- but forty days, . thirteen days
being spent in resting. Mr. Wirt describes
the ' journey .- as . an outing. It i was very
cold, of scourse^ the thermometer at St.
Michael registering 40 degrees below aero
and running from, that to 20 below during
the. trip. -On the Yukon a heavy snow
storm was experienced, which greatly re
tarded; progress, but. on .the whole, the
weather^ was' good and free from. storms.
With the: exception of ten nights, when
they slept quite comfortably Â¦in their
sleeping bags, laid on a: snowbank, the
travelers got their. nights' rest'in Indian
'cabins. They had a good dog team and
carried, their, own. food, the stock being
replenished five times en route. , There Is
plenty- of 'game' to* be- had, food -for dogs
is; plentiful and the Indians are : friendly
and kind. r : :
> r The "two ; mall carriers traveled by. what
is known as the Katmei route, which Mr.
AVlrt i says |is the most practicable : winter
route to Nome and fully a thousand milos
shorter.', than"; the 'one '; via ;: Dawson and
Skaguay." "They ; went from *; Nome toSL'
Michael, thence >to 5 Andraoefsky.V from
jr hero; thejr '^ayÂ»* - trig 'to
Kuskokwin River, which they followed to
Bristol Bay, an arm of Bering Sea. From
there the route continual to Nuskagak,
thence across the peninsular range of
mountains, which is on the main land op
posite Kodiak. They reached the latter
place on March 2. .
Mr. Wirt erected a hospital at Nome
and a busy season he had of It during the
winter. 4 - There were 300 cases of typhoid
in the city during the winter and 125 wero
treated at the hospital. â¢ In all thirty per
sons died of the disease. This sickness
and the shortage of fuelâ beach wood, and
poor beach wood at thatâ selling for $40 a
cord, made the lot of the miners not an
enviable one.-
There were 3000 people in Nome on Jan
uary 10. but many were coming from
Dawson and Kotzebue Sound. Those from
Dawson'had very hard trips and at St.
Michael Mr. Win heard that many had
perished, although this could not be con
firmed. All the ground within 100 miles
of Nome has been staked, but there is,
much country outside that radius which
will amply repay ; the prospector.
Many new strikes have been made and
are apparently very rich. There was
little work done during the winter on ac
count of the scarcity of fuel and thawing
machines. . A few boilers were taken from
steamers and launches and in this way
several beach claims were Worked with
considerable â¢ success.
\ The report that . prospectors had re
turned from Siberia with an account of
fabulously rich ground on the far side of
Bering Sea, Mr. Wlrt said was absolute
ly false. A party left for . Siberia a ,f ew
days before he started, but none had re
turned.. When asked as. to the prospects
of steamers which have already started
for Cape Nome. Mr. Wirt. said that it
would be impossible. to reach there before
June 15. However, there is open water
at the head of Norton Bay. 100 miles east
of > Nome, and by * May, passengers might
bo landed within' fifty: miles Â¦ of, the city.

Two natives who crossed and looted an
abandoned Boer farm are now in custody.
Colonel Dalsxty's position Is strong and
well chosen, but he Is completely sur
rounded. The Boers have- their backs
against Basutoland. ar.d if they stay much
longer they will be hemmed in. The Brit
ish operations are keenly watched from
the neighboring heights. Shelling and
c-.'n(rp have bfÂ»en jrolnz on steadily during
the last six days.
Colonel Dalgety's guns are admirably
served, ar.d there is no waste of ammuni

tric flash of the coroite, bolt into their
holes or behind walls. So near are the
Boers ar.d the Basuto Guards that they
converse. The ambulances are. close to
the bord-r, but the killed and wounded
are r.ot removed until nightfall, in order
to cor.ceal the number of casualties. The
Boers are fatigued and their horses are
tired ar.d footsore.

that there are ninety cases of enteric
fever and dysentery In the prisoners"

Government failed to supply, on demand
of the doctor, the necessary medicines

MAY CAUSE TROUBLE
BY JOINING BOERS
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON. April 15.â Lieutenant Ernest
S. Morse of Company F, Fifth Regiment
of the Massachusetts militia, has left the
State with a commission in the army of
the South African republic in his pocket.
The exact nature of the commission is
not known, but the family of the young
officer in Wayland. Mass., state that
Lieutenant Morse will serve upon the per
sonal staff of President Krucer. The mili
tary authorities of the State are very
much disturbed over the manner of Lieu
tenant Morse's departure. It is ascertain
ed that the your.g officer, who is a vetiran
of the Spanish war. has not yet legally
resigned his commission in the Massa
chusetts militia. His resignation, accord
ing to the statement made by his family,
was forwarded to the adjutant generals
office three days ago. but It has not been
received there yet, and, of course, has noi.
been acted upon. : ,,Â» * ;
Lieutenant Morse did not wait for offi
cial sanction of his enterprise. If he hau
he probably never would have obtained
It. for, though only a militia officer, the
lieutenant was nore the less under ihe
authority of the United States War De
partment; and. while he is a_mernber ,pt
the State Guards, he cannot, unite him
self with the army of a foreign country
except by permission of that department.
Henre his alleged purpose of becoming
an active ally of the Boers in the Held
assumes the magnitude of an interna
tional incident. It is understood that tht
War Department la interesting itself li,
Morse's enterprise and that an effort will
be made to frustrate his purpose.
This is the first case on record of an
officer of the Massachusetts State Guard
going to join the belligerents in South
Africa. Lieutenant Morse is a man oi
about SS years of age and was formerly
in the United States army.
RUMORED VICTORY
OF BRABANT'S HORSE
LONDON, April 16. -The Cape Town cor
respondent of the Daily Telegraph, tele

"An unconfirmed report is in circulation
here that General Brabant has inflicted a
crushing defeat upon ihe Boers at Wep
ener, capturing guns and taking prison
ers."
The Bioemfontein correspondent of the
Times, telegraphing Sunday, says: "It is
reported that reinforcements for the
Boers, with sixty wagons, have arrived
at Dewetsdorp. en route for Wcpener.
This should precipitate an action. The
statement that President Kruger has
been south seems to confirm the reports
that the Boers are getting disheartened.
This continued exertion of his personal
influence* appears now to have become a
necessity."

LONG'S ATTITUDE PUTS
POLITICIANS AT SEA
Announcement That He Would Ac
cept the Vice Presidency Causes
a Stir.
WASHINGTON, April 15.â Secretary
Long's implied willingness to accept the
Republican nomination for the Vice Presi
dency, as inferred from the statements
made by him on that subject yesterday,
was a matter of general comment In
Washington to-day. It set Republican
slate makers to thinking and for the time
being has seriously upset the calculations
of those who believed that the honor
would go to one of a half dozen others
mentioned for the Vice Presidency.
Secretary Long was called on by a num
ber of persons during the day and was
importuned for an exact statement of his
attitude on the question. He seemed dis
inclined to enter into any general discus
sion" of the matter, however, preferring
to let It rest with .what he has already
said on the subject, believing that the
Vice Presidency is an honor of such a
character that no man could well refuse
to accept it. The Secretary, however, 4s
not an avowed candidate seeking the
place, but the belief is general that If the
nomination is offered to him he will ac
cept. *
Secretary Long was asked to-night for
an expression of opinion regarding
Dewey's candidacy for the Presidency. In
a good natured way he evaded a reply,
but laughingly remarked that Dewey
"was the honored man of our navy."
OPPOSES PATTISON.
Altgeld Would Not Have Him on the
Ticket With Bryan.
CHICAGO, April 15.â Ex-Governor Alt
geld was spoken to to-day concerning the
suggestion of nominating ex-Governor
Pattlson of Pennsylvania as the running
mate of Mr. Bryan. He said:
"I notice that the Palmer and Buckner
newspapers of America are urging his
nomination. Those papers and those men
who have been very hostile to Mr. Bryan
and are still hostile to what he represents
and would like to see him defeated, and
yet wish to go with the Democratic party
this year, a^e urging the nomination of
Mr. Pattlson. Personally I believe that
the nomination of Mr. Pattlson for the
Vice Presidency would be as great a mis
fortune as the nomination we made In
1896 for that place, if not greater. Our
candidate for that place In 1596 was, at
least, positively with us on the silver
question, but he did not command the
confidence of our people on any other
question and greatly weakened our ticket.
Mr. Pattison has not been positively with'
us on any proposition, and It is safe to say
that at least 85 per cent of the Democrats
of America would be disappointed at such
a nomination." -: r

CALL HEADQUARTERS. WELLING
TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON. April 15.â
Admiral Dewey has been given an oppor
tunity to explain fully his position In re
lation to the Democratic party by a prom
inent member of the Democratic Nationat
Committee, who has written to the ad
miralâa letter which may later be given
out for publication. It is not known
whether this letter was written for the
purpose -of giving Admiral Dewey a
chance to announce his political princi
ples, though the general belief is that the
committeeman, in writing the letter, was
acting in support of the candidacy of Wil
liam J. Bryan.
After expressing due regard for Ad
miral Dewey, it is said that the writer of
the letter proceeded to explain that his
allegiance to the Democratic party was
such that he could not restrain himself
from asking certain questions. He was,
he wrote, happy to learn that- Admiral
Dewey considered himself a Democrat,
but there has been so much talk of a
third ticket with Dewey at the head that
he considered it only fair that a more
specific announcement should be made
than has yet come from Admiral Dewey.
He then asked whether Admiral Dewey
Intended to let his name be presented to
the convention that has . been called to
meet in Kansas City. If so, he wanted to
know whether the admiral was prepared
to stand by any platform that may be
there adopted. A pointed question was
then asked as to whether Admiral Dewey
would, if he failed to secure the nomina
tion, support the candidate named by the
party. Permission has been given to Ad
miral Dewey to make the letter public
and to answer it through the press.
Admiral and Mrs<. Dewey received few
visitors to-day. They spent most of the
afternoon driving and did not reach their
home until Just before dinner. It Is ru
mored that the admiral will again visit
New York before he starts on his West
ern trip.
The only visitor at the admiral's coun
try residence to-day to whom any polit
ical significance is attached was Nathan
Straus of New York, who Is an avowed
advocate of Admiral Dewey' s candidacy, j
Mr. Straus spent several hours in con
sultation.with the admiral relative to the
forthcoming declaration of principles,
which will be promulgated probably on
Tuesda*' next. It is well known that Mr.
Straus is co-operating with Perry Bel
mont and other sound money Democrats
who are interested in the Dewey move
ment.
The admiral declined to discuss the de
tails of Mr. Straus' visit beyond saying
that Straus made a friendly call and
seemed to enjoy the beautiful surround
ings and balmy weather of Easter Sun
day. Mr. Straus returned to Washington
and took the afternoon train for New
York. A personal friend of Straus to
night raid that New York could be de
pended upon to give the Dewey boom a
decided boost in the near future.
BITTER POLITICAL FIGHT.
State Campaign in Louisiana Is
Brought to a Close.
NEW ORLEANS, April 15.â The State
campaign, Â¦which closed i last night, haÂ»
been very bitter. The Caftery Republican
faction, of which Senator Caffery's son is
the candidate for Governor, has severely
arraigned Democratic election methods
and attacked the one-man power they say
is exercised by Governor Fos.ter. The lat
ter at one time threatened to call Senator
Caffery, who has taken an active part In
the Republican campaign, to personal ac
count.
There are two Republican tickets, one
representing the Wimberley faction and
one the Caffery faction. The Caffery man-
EXPOSITION
THROWN OPEN
TO THE PUBLIC
Weather Was Auspicious
and the Grounds Were
Thronged.
Visitors Were Mostly Foreigners as
the Parisians Prefer to Wait
Until Everything Is
Completed.
- PARIS, April 15.â Glorious weather fa
vored the opening of the exposition to the
general public to-day and enormous
crowds flockeu into the grounds. The
area of the exhibition, however," is bo
treat that nowhere was there any great
rush. The visitors were mainly composed
of provincials and foreigners. Compara
tively few Parisians were teen. Aware
of the great backwardness of the prepara
tions they remained away for the most
part.
The management demanded two en
trance tickets for morning admission, one
for afternoon admission and two during
the evening, when the Eiffel Tower and
the palaces on the Champs de Mars were
illuminated. But there were absolutely
no attractions provided, not even a band
of music, and the peoplt promenaded in
front of the empty and in many cases un
finished buildings, and along roads there
only in the cafe of the main avenues had
the work of paving been completed.
Visitors who left the central arteries
found their pathway filled with pitfalls
and heaped With debris, some thorough
fares resembling mere bridle paths.
The crcwd, however, was perfectly good
natured and took nfa matter philosophi
cally. Hardly a murmur was heard any
where in the way of criticism.
The moving sidewalk, access to which
cost 60 centimes, proved a great success
and was jammed a!l day.
The American national pavilion remain
ed closed. So also did most of the other
pavilions, for the excellent reasons that
their interiors are still unfinished.
Two hundred and fifty thousand persons
passed through the turnstiles at the expo
sition to-day.

WATERBURY, Vt., April 15â John C.
Farrar, teller of the Waterbury National
Bank, is missing and there is a defalcation
of $:>5,000 of the bank's funds. The com
munity is greatly shocked by the news,
as Farrar was considered a model young
man. His parents are very estimable peo
ple, and two years ago he married a young
lady of high standing.
The shortage was discovered by Cashier
Wells Friday afternoon. When he called
Farrar's attention to the fact the latter
said there must be some mistake in the
books. They began an examination at 6
o'clock, when Farrar suggested that they
go to supper and return in the evening for
further examination. He has not Deen
seen or heard of since. One train going
south is due to leave the station at 6:10
and one northwest at 6:30, but nothing has
developed to show that he took either.
The only other explanation is suicide. He
was treasurer of the village and had
charge of about $3500 in that capacity, but
it is not known whether these funds are
missing. Â¦ â¢ Â¦

STRIKERS ARE
READY TO FIGHT
THE MILITIA
Hundreds of Deputies Guard
the Works at Croton
Italians Are "Well Armed and a
Conflict Would Result in
Great Loss of
Life.
CROTON LANDING, N. V., April, 15.â
While everything is quiet and peaceful
in the neighborhood of the Croton dam
to-night," nearly 300 armed deputies < are
guarding the works, and each one of them
is guessing, as to what to-morrow may
bring forth. The striking Italian labor
ers, whose homes are in the vicinity of the
works, are behaving, themselves excel
lently. ' But underneath their assumed
quiet there is stubborn resolve not to go
back to w,ork-nor let any outsiders take
their places, until: the contractors agree
to* pay the increase of wages demanded.
Strenuous efforts are being made by Ital
ian Consul' Branchi to bring about a set
tlement of the difficulty.
The strikers are very determined in
their demands, and swear that If outside
labor is brought here they will tight tooth
and nail to prevent it. Angfclo Rotella,
who is the recognized leader, of the strik
ers, said to-day:
"Thia is a light to a finish. We earn
-more money than we are receiving and
the contractors must pay us for our work.
The State should protect us, and instead
of sending deputies and soldiers to help
the bosses, they should compel them to
treat us rightfully. If the bosses attempt
t6 bring the other laborers here we shall
prevent any work being done, and if tho
military comes to help them, then we will
light the soldiers."
Kotella spoke earnestly and his remarks
were listened to by a crowd of his coun
trymen, who voiced the same manner,
which showed undoubted determination.
The strikers are all well armed with guns
and pistols, and in this regard they have
a decided advantage over the Sheriff's
deputies, who have only long night sticks
and 32-caliber revolvers. The deputies
are in a valley, while the strikers com
mand the adjoining hill. With the gnns
the Italians could riddle the Sheriff's men,
who In return could not send a bullet
from their revolvers half way up the hill
side in case a fight should take place.
There were several additions to the rankii
of the deputies to-day and there are now
Â£00 of them at the works. Many of them
complain of the food furnished and of
overwork, and threats of a strike among
the d</nities' were rife to-day.
ThÂ» strikers and the deputies mingled
at the Easter service in the little Roman
Catholic chapel In tne valley. The men
greeted each other amicably and there
was no show of trouble.
Father Owens counseled the strikers
to obey the law and shun the saloons.
When informed late to-night that troops
were about to be ordered out. Angelo Ro
tella, the leader, was much perturbed
and downcast. He said:
"Only some of our men are armed, but
they will all be armed in the morning. I
will resist every attempt by the con
tractors to renew the work to-morrow
with strange men and we will fight if
necessary."
WILL OEBEB OUT TROOPS.
Sheriff Malloy Makes a Formal De
mand on General Roe.
NEW YORK, April 15.â General Roe re
ceived a formal written demand from
Sheriff Malloy of Westchester County
this morning to call out 500 troops to go |
immediately to the scene of the Italian!
laborers' strike at Croton Dam, and has
decided to order out early to-morrow
morning the. fourth separate company of
Yonkers, the eleventh separate company
of Mount Vernon, Squadron A of New
York and Troop C of Brooklyn. The
troops will number 160 Infantry and ijO
cavalry. General Roe thinks that these
men will be sufficient to quell the strike.
ADVERTISEMENTS.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, APRIL 16, 1900.
MILLIONAIRE
WRIGHT DIES
OF HIS WOUND
Insisted On His Deathbed
That Mrs. Lottridge Was
Blameless.
Chief of Police Has No Evidence
Against the Woman, but Believes
the Bead Man Bid Not
Shoot Himself.
CHICAGO, April 15.â Rufus Wright, the
millionaire manufacturer of rubber tires,
who was shot during a scuffle for posses
sion of a revolver in the apartments of
Mrs. Louisa Lottrldge, at the Leland
Hotel died to-day from the effects of the
wound. The body of the millionaire is at
an undertaking room, where an Inquest
will be held to-morrow.
It la the opinion of the police tnat the
Coronor's investigation will mark the.
close of the sensational case. A state
ment by the deceased to Chief of Detec
tives Colleran that the shooting was ac
cidental will, it is thought, clear Mrs.
Lottridge* of all responsibility. "Wright
died with words of exculpation on his lips
for the woman whose revolver was re
sponsible for his death. He persisted in
saying that the woman was not to blame
for his condition, and that he had the
revolver in his hand when it was dis
charged.
Mr. Wright's Bon-in-law and partner,
Fred Morgan, was at his side at death.
Mr. Morgan insisted that his ' father-in
law was on an errand to help a friend
who had become entangled with the
woman when he received his death wound.
Although he admits he can offer no evi
dence. Chief of Detectives Colleran
strongly believes that the weapon was
not in the hands of Wright when it was
discharged. A careful examination of the
position of the wound, he says, will show
that it would be impossible for Wright to
have held the weapon in his hand. Cap
tain Colleran says also that Mrs. Lott
ridge said she could not remember
whether the weapon was in her hand or
Wright's. He also cites the fact that
Wright's beard Is not singed, as it would
have been if the weapon had been dis
charged close to his head. His face is not
marked with powder: in fact. Captain
Coleran says, there is nothing to show
that he held a revolver very close to his
face.
Mrs. Lottridge, in a statement made at
the police station, said:
I cannot remember what led up to thÂ» pro
duction of the revolver. I was talking to Mr.
Wright when he asked me to show him a re
volver of which he had spoken previously. I
refused to do so and we talked on other mat
ters for a while. I remember that finally I
went to my valise and took out my weapon
and when he saw it Mr. Wright begged me to
throw it away. As I remember, he tMed to
take the weapon from my hand and we scuffled.
I stood up and* he was sitting on the couch. I
had hold of the weapon, when, with a sudden
effort, he tore the revolver from my gTasp. He
fell backward and I followed him. I managed
to get hold of the butt of the weapon, he hoM
lng- to the guard. As we struggled the weapon
was discharged, and bad as I felt from the
liquor I had drunk I could not help crying out
In horror when I saw he was wounded. He
fell back on the FO'a and easp?d that hfÂ» was
shot. I laughed hysterically and told him hÂ»
was all right. He Insisted he had been wound
ed and begged me to call a doctor.
I told him he was dreaming and then set
about caring for him. I took a handkerchief
from his pocket and attempted to stanch the
flow of blood from his neck where the ball had
entered. .. I saw at a glance that the revolver
had done deadly work, but I could not bring
myself to tell any one of the occurrence. I wait
ed on, Mr. Wright for two hours possibly be
fore I summoned a doctor. I was so overcome
that I could not talk and may have said things
I ought not to have said, but the pressure I
was laboring under was the excuse for my
actions. The story that Mr. Wright came to
my room in the interest of a friend is false.
He came to see me at my request. He had
known me long enough to come at my .least
call. He wa* In good spirits when he entered
the room. We drank and talked of. matters
which concerned ourselves. We had a pleasant
conversation until the revolver was Introduced
by chance and the struggle which ended in his
death.

THE IDOL OF THE TURF.
The Most Popular Jockey in America
and England Recommends Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets.
No Jockey has ever appealed so strongly
to public favor as Tod Sloan.
He has achieved more than his most
noted predecessors ever attempted and
etands in a class by himself.
Not satisfied wiyi his successes in his
native country, he went to England and
row his fame as a successful horseman is
on the tip of every tongue not only In
this country and England, but In every
section of the globe where racing has
found favor.
When Tod first went to England his
temerity wÂ»s openly laughed at, but the
little American played skittles with his
English rivals and his victories made all
England gasp.
Havingthe Ftamp of royal approval, so-
ciety both at home and abroad "lionize"
him and he is feted and petted to an ex-
tÂ»nt that would turn an ordinary mortal's
head.
The great Jockey was In such demand
socially and dined and wined to such an
extent that It wap feared his health
would give way. Too much society and
the nervous strain of racing told on him.
A two weeks' trip to America made him
acquainted with Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets and their remarkably restorative
*-ff'-cts on a df-pleted digestive apparatus
jin<s he recommendM them in unstinted
trrms to a friend, saying. "Stuart's Dys-
jiopsia Tablets are the best thing I know
of for keeping the stomach In condition
and appetite In good repair."
Thousands of former dyspeptics can
vouch for the truth of Tod Sloan's words.
A.i 'â¢Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets" have be-
come a household word In America and
few families are without thexif. One of
two taken after meals keep the stomach
sweet by causir.g: prompt and healthy dl-
ppstlon of the food.
Perfectly healthy people use them after
hf-avy dinners to keep their good health
end to make sure that no 111 effects will
follow an unusually hearty meal.
Your dnjggl6t will tell you or your doc-
tor either that Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
are composed only of digestive ferments,
Apceptlc Pepf!n, Hydrastis. fruit acids,
ftc. and for the etronjr stomach as well
us the most delicate constitute a safe-
guard against indigestion and stomach
troubles.

CYCLONE IN KANSAS;
SNOW IN COLORADO
One Spreads Death and Destruction
While the Other Blockades Moun
tain Railways.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., April 15.â A
Journal special from "Wichita,
Kan., says: A storm approaching a
tornado in proportion Is reported
from near "Winfleld, between here
and Newton, and in the vicinity west of
Clearwater. Two deaths are reported and
four persons are said to have been injured
by overturned houses. "Wires are down
and names and particulars are unobtain
able at 10 o'clock to-night. At Putnam It
Is reported several houses were blown
down and four persons seriously injured.
Word was brought by passengers on the
southbound Santa Fe passenger train that
two persons were killed, but It Is impos
sible to confirm this report.
The telephone and telegraph wires were
rendered useless by the wind and all at
tempts to reach Putnam, Newton^or af
fected points have jfroved of no avail.
West of Clearwater, in the country
northeast of Adams, on the Englewood
branch of the Santa Fe Railroad, it is
reported that a strip of country five miles
long was swept by a storm at 6 o clock
this evening and several farmhouses,
barns and other buildings blown down.
No casualties are reported from there.
The fact that indefinite scraps of in
formation are all that can be secured
gives cause for alarm that the storm Is
much more serious than Is generally ad
mitted. From a small settlement several
miles west of Fremont, in Sumner
County, it is said all of the houses were
wrecked, with loss of life. This report
cannot be substantiated.
The storm area, so far as can be learn
ed, extends over about ten counties near
and at the southern line of the State. The
cyclonic disturbance seems to have fol
lowed the trend of the Arkansas River.
NEWTON, Kans., April 15.â This morn
ing over an Inch of rain fell here and be
tween 6 and 7 o'clock this evening thren
Inches of water fell, flooding the north
east part of the city. A "baby" cyclone,
accompanying the storm this evening
took a southeasterly course a mile and &
half southeast of here. It jumped a farm
house and took the roof off a barn.
RAILWAY OFFICERS
FEAR BIG WASHOUTS
DENVER, April 15.â A mixture of rain
and snow has been falling Incessantly
throughout the State of Colorado for the
past twenty-four hours. "With tho excep
tion of intervals of a few hours the
stormy weather has been continuous for
eleven days. Previous to this there had
been but little moisture for months and
the present visitation was received with
welcome. Now fear is being expressed of
the possible damage that may accrue
from it. Although no serious damage to
railroads has as yet been reported, sev
eral small washouts have occurred, and
railroad officials are prepared to receive
news of greater ones. In the agricul
tural districts much seed had been plant
ed, and as the ground Is now saturated it
is feared the seed will rot in the ground.
From Idaho Springs, Central City and
other points In the Clear Creek district
come reports of a heavy snowfall yeater
day and to-day, blocking the railroads
and paralyzing the mining Industry In
that section.
At 5 o'clock this afternoon the snow
was three feet deep and still falling. The
weather Is warm and the snow cannot
last, and It is feared slides and washouts
will come with the thaw. Cheyenne.
Wyo., reports the southeastern part of
Wyoming thoroughly soaked.
A 24-inch water main broke at Twenty
fifth and Franklin streets here this after
noon, flooding the adjacent property and
cutting off the water supply for two
miles in the resident district. Street rail
way companies are having trouble with
washouts.
A report comes from Fort Collins that
the Cache la Poudre and St. Vraln rivers
are badly swollen, the latter belns two
miles wide at Lonemont. Ordinarily the
St. Vraln Is but a small stream, and If the
report Is correct much damage will result
to ranch property In the lowlands around
Longmont. There are no towns In a posi
tion near enough to either of these rivers
to suffer to any grea.t extent. Longmont
Is inaccessible to-night by wire.

Ing out a stretch of several hundred feet

ATTACKS WESTMINSTER
CONFESSION OF FAITH
Rev. Charles H. Parkhurst Declares
for a New Presbyterian
Creed.
NEW YORK, April 15.â Rev. Charles H.
Parkhurst, speaking In his pulpit In Mad-
Ison-square Presbyterian Church to-day,
made a vigorous assault on the Westmin
ster Confession of Faith. He said:
"We ought to have a new confession of
faith. It Is surprising that the Presby
terian Church Is able to do as much as it
is doing with such an Incubus strapped
upon us as we are tottering under In our
present confession. In the Hrst place, the
thing needed is not a system of theology,
for that is what our present confession is,
but a simple, brief. Saxon statement of a
half-dozen of the vital ingredients of Jesu 8
Christ's message to the world. I could
get along with a confession of faith con
taining but the little that Jesus said when
he was trying to make a Christian >of
Nlcodemus: 'God so loved the world that
he gave His only begotten Son, that who
soever belleveth in him should not perish,
but have eternal life.' That gives, to us
the doctrine of God's unlimited love, hu
man guilt, the divinity of Christ, salvation
through Christ, faith in Christ, immortal
ity-7-every word Saxon, three quarters of
the words monosyllables, profound enough
for any elder, simple enough for any four
year-old.
"At any rate, we want a new creed.
Amending this one will not meet the ne
cessities of the case. Better give It a dig
niticd place in the museum, for what It is,
than hack it to pieces and revamp It for
what it is not."

Broad Gauge to Los Gatos.
Special Dispatch to The Call
LOS GATOS. April 15.-The first of the
regular broad gauge passenger trains ar
rived to-day. Some three years ago a
third rail was laid from San Jose to Los
Gatos. making the road between these
points a combination broad and narrow
gauge, but the only use to which it was
put previous to this time was for freight
and an occasional excursion train. Under
the new schedule Los Gatos is made the
terminal for the two broad gauge trains
formerly running only to San Jose. This
gives direct connection with San Fran

GENERAL GOMEZ SNUBS
THE CIVIL GOVERNOR
Great Excitement Attends the Re
ception to the Officer in San
tiago de Cuba.
SANTIAGO DE CUBA, April 15.â The
reception tendered to General Maximo
Gomez to-day on his way to San Domingo
caused great excitement, owing to the
efforts of the white and black parties
to obtain the first recognition. The black
party, represented by the Cubano Libre,
which continues occasional publications
in defiance of the orders of the authori
ties, who had directed Its suppression,
sent a tug to meet the steamer Maria
Herrera at quarantine and succeeded in
inducing General Gomez to accompany
them.
Meanwhile another tug. carrying the
civil governor. General Castillo, the Mayor
and other officials, representing the domi
nant white party, was entirely ignored by
Gomez.
The black party, highly elated, took the
guest to the landing, where an Immense
crowd gathered on the frail private wharf
of a local boat club. This collapsed and
many were thrown Into the water, one
man being drowned.
The official party declined to recognize
General Gonv?z in consequence of his
recognition of the black party, and there
Is considerable excitement.
When the procession passed through the
city without either civil governor or
mayor rioting was narrowly prevented by
the vigorous action of the police under
American officers. This afternoon all the
clubs gave receptions to General Gomez,
hut the white party refused to attend any
of them.
CUT HIS OWN TOMB
IN A MARBLE BLOCK
Remains of Allen Taylor, a Pioneer,
Laid in the Grave He Had
Prepared.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ANGELS CAMP, April 15.â A unique
burial took place at Altaville Cemetery
yesterday. Allen Taylor, a pioneer, died
at his home on Thursday, and his family
at once consulted John Carley, an under
taker with whom the aged marble worker
had made arrangements four years ago
In regard to his burial. A grave which
the old man had prepared was opened
and In it was found a marble box just
large enough to receive a body without
a casket of any kind.
Taylor had had. some bitter disappoint
ments in his fanÂ»ily a few years ago and
since then life has had little interest for
him. He conceived the idea of construct
ing his own grave, cut the marble and
placed the box In a secure position. He
then called the undertaker, and after
showing him the grave, was told that It
was too small for the reception of a
casket, at which he laughed, stating that
he wished to be burled that way, so in
respect to his wishes the body was draped
In a shroud, placed on a covered bier and
borne to its last resting place by his
pioneer friends, where It was lowered
into the white marble receptacle made by
the hands which are now at rest within.

In Certain Districts a Good Deal of
Wire Cutting Is Being Done, a
Shortage of Linemen Be
ing Reported.
KNOXVILLE, Term., April 15.â The
strike on the Knoxville division of the
Southern Railroad did not prevent all the
passenger trains moving on time to-day.
The officials say that freight trains, which
left on regular schedules, are also run
ning on time. Former telegraph operators
of Sweetwater and Bearden have been ar
rested, charged with cutting wires. Guards
are being kept at several telegraph sta
tions to prevent any one entering the
properties. Superintendent Ewlng says
President Powell's statement that tralilc
is blocked on this division is untrue. Two
night operators and three agents went out
on this division to-day.
ATLANTA, Ga.. April 15.â President
Powell of the telegraphers to-night gave
out a statement, in which he says:
"The conditions to-night are entirely
satisfactory to the men. Telegrams re
ceived by me from every division on the
system indicate a feeling of unrest and
dissatisfaction on the part of the train
and engine men on the system as a result
of the wreck on the Mobile division last
night.
"My action In declaring a boycott
against the Southern has brought a large
number of telegrams to-day from ticket
and freight agents on every road of any
consequence from Maine to California,
promising support."
WASHINGTON, April 15.â Third Vice
President and General Manager Gannon
of the Southern Railroad Company to
night made the following statement con
cerning the strike:
"The so-called strike, if It ever existed,
of the telegraph operators, might be con
sidered ended. Out of a total of sonv*
1400 operators less than 10 per cent left the
service of the company, whose places have
now been supplied, and there Is absolutely
no Interruption In the telegraph system
from this cause and passenger and freight
trains are being conducted without any
delay.
"Telegrams and telegraphic reports re
ceived to-night from all superintendents
of the line indicate a general desire for
reinstatement of the operators who left
the service, the citizens of some of the
towns Interceding for them. Â¦ The com
pany will prosecute in the courts any per
sons interfering with the conduct of Its
business, several arrests having been
.made and others will follow."
ASHEVILLE, N. C, April 15.â A1l pas
senger trains on the Southern arrived and
departed on time here to-day. Wires are
still being cut In local territory. Â¦ Rail
road officials say they have operators In

Harrowing Tale of a Sink

Story of a Marine Disaster at Wad

Saffron-Colored Fake of
Worst Variety.

Soeclal Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA CRUZ, April 15.â The story pub
lished in the saffron-colored San Fran
cisco journal this morning stating
that a three-masted ship had gone
ashore on Waddell Beach proves
to be a fake of the yellowest variety. In
Its anxiety to catch up in the journalistic
race and occasionally print what purports
to be news the bubonic plague paper has
been driven to the straits of manufactur
ing gauzy yarns on the most flimsy foun
dation.
The lighthouse tender Madrona fur
nished the pretext for the yellow sheet to
bunko its readers. In delivering light
house supplies Friday afternoon the ves
sel found It necessary to go pretty close
to the rocks, as is Its custom. It was
noticed by an ambitious correspondent of
the Irresponsible journal and without In
vestigation a story of a shipwreck was
printed with all Its harrowing details.
The "signals of distress" were not over
looked and "the breakers breaking furi
ously over her" were "played up" for all
they were worth.
As Is usual, however, with sensational
eion, and for the first time every State

MEASURES OF
IMPORTANCE
IN THE SENATE
Their Supporters Struggle
to Obtain Earliest Con
sideration.
#
Alaska Code Bill, Quay Resolution
and the Bill Providing for Gov
ernment of Philippines to
Be Discussed.
PVSHINGTON. April 15.â Tbe Senate
continue during the week to devote
ttentlon to the Alaskan code bill, the
Â¦ resolution and the bill providing for
emporary government of the Philip-
Islands. There also will be more or
lers sparring for place on the part of the
friends of the Nicaragua canal, chief
among whom is Senator Morgan of Ala
bama. Possibly also Senators Frye and
Hanna will make an effort to bring the
subsidy shipping bill up, but the chances
are that no move will be made in that dl
jection until after some of the measures
before the Senate are disposed of.
Senator Carter will try on Monday to
get a day fixed for a vote on the Alaskan
bill. There are only two amendments of
importance remaining to be acted upon
in connection with that measure and it is
thought these could be disposed of at a
very early date If the frienos of the Alas
kan bill would agree to assist in the tak
ing up of other legislation when it is out
of the way. Senator Morgan seems at
present inclined to hold up the code meas
ure until he can receive some assurance
on the canal bill, but so far has appar
ently not been successful in that direc
tion.
There is a notable disposition to use
the Alaskan bill and the Philippine bill to
delay the taking up of the subsidy bill.
The Democrats in the Senate are prac
tically united in opposition to the sub
sidy proposition. Senator Lodge, in
charge of the Philippine bill, announces
it to be his purpose to ask a vote on it
whenever the Democrats make an open
ing for such suggestion. Aparently. how
ever, he is not very sanguine of success.
Senator Hoar has given notice of a
speech on the Philippine question on
Tuesday next, and he is expected then to
fully outline his views on the question of
expansion.
The week in the House will be largely
taken up with the consideration of the
naval appropriation bill, over which there
promises to be a protracted struggle. The
whole question of armor plate, except
that for the Maine. Wisconsin and Mis
souri, will be fought out. The minority
members of the committee, led by Wheel
er of Kentucky, will make a strong fight
for the establishment of a Government
armor factory as the best solution of the
vexed problem. An atttempt will also bo
made by the minority of the committee
for the building of ships in Government
yards.
WASHINGTON, April 15.âPoliti
cians here and throughout the
East are greatly interested in
the suggestion in the Colorado
Springs Gazette that Edward O. Wolcott
would make an ideal running mate for
President McKinley. The main argument
in his favor is that, In spite of some un
popularity in his own State, .gained while
battling for the administration against the
tide of Silver Republicans, he is admired
for his great ability and has a strong per-
sonal following, which, added to the nat
ural pride of the State In having one of Its
sons on the Presidential ticket, would, it

In vindicating the Seventy-first Regi
ment Colonel Bacon often contrasts the
conduct of the New York volunteers and
the colonel of the Rough Riders, and in
doing so makes bitter attacks upon tht-
Governor. On pages 31 and 35 Colonel Ba
con charges the Governor with blood
thirsUness and unsoldlerly conduct in
boasting of the killing of Spaniards in on*
of the battles before Santiago. Colonel
Bacon's pamphlet says:

of this battle found In "The Hough Riders."
by Theodore Roosevelt, and quote from pages
12* and ]Â£>: "Flm Serpeant Clarence Gould
killed a Spanish soldier v.ith his revolver just
as the Pnanlard was aiming: at one of my
Rough Riders; at about tlie same time I also
shot one. I was with Henry Bardshar, run
ning up at double, and two Spaniards leaped
from the trenches and fired at us not ten yards
away. As thoy turned to run, I closed in and
fired twice, m'sslne the first and killing the
second. At the time I did not know of Oould's
exploit and supposed my feat to be unique;
alth"Ugh Gould had killed his Spaniard In the
trenches, not very far from me, I never learned
of It until weeks later."
His slaying a fleeing Spaniard less than thirty
feet away sounds very much like murder.
Colonel Roosevelt stands out against the lurid
horizon of war as the solitary biographer from
the days of Caesar till now to write himself
down boastlngly as a flayer of his fellow man,
and that. too. at such close range.
In the same paragraph Colonel Bacon

reputation by an account of exultant
bloodthirstiness.

COLORADO'S JUNIOR SENATOR
AS McKINLEY'S RUNNING MATE
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, MONDAY, APRIL 16, 1900.
NEW YORK. April 15.â Governor
Theodore Roosevelt la practically
accused of quitting at Santiago by
Colonel Alexander S. Bacon in a
pamphlet Issued late Saturday aft
ernoon In defense of the Seventy-first
Regiment. This grave accusation is found
on page 25 In paragraphs which read as
follows:
Major Reade. in his official report (Inspector
general'e report, page 102) states that Colonel
J loose ve!t made thi* statement: "Twenty-flve
per cent of my Rough Kid en can't carry a pall
at water from cr^ek to trenches. No men can
decry me or my regimetst. but we must accede
U the next proposition from the enemy."
Tl-.ls marvelous demand was made at head
quarters before the enemy surrendered. The
B*renty-flnt Ilepiment had more than 50 per
rer.t of Its men who not only could not carry
r. pail of water, but whose legs could not carry
th*-!r own bodies: yet they never dictated joll
c;es to their superior ofScers nor boasted of
their sufferings.
Ttnej were not "quitters," and were never 6O
anxious to pet home as to suggest easy terms
fr>r the enemy.
The importance of this charge lies in
the fact that Colonel Bacon is one of the
best-kaova officers in the National Guard
of New York. Besides, he is a Republican
of considerable prominence. He is a
former member of the Assembly.
In the National Guard Colonel Bacon
has been captain, major and lieutenant
colonel of the Twenty-third Regiment.
Colonel Bacon has always taken the side
<ji the officers and men of the Beventy
flrst Regiment and has denounced the
finding's of the State Court of Inquiry. He
is especially bitter toward Governor

marriage of Mrs. Frances
B Hodgson Burnett, the famous au
fL^tl thor, to her young secretary,
v&F Stephen Townsend, again calls at
Â¦ tention to the frequent union of
women of mature years with men
much their juniors.
Mrs. Burnett is now somewhere In the
fifties, and her life has been as full of
romance as that of any of her heroine.^.
Like most of her books, it promises to
come to a peaceful termination after long
years yet to be of happiness and content.
Frances Hodgson was born in England,
but her parents came to this country
when the future author was but a child
and settled In Eastern Tennessee. The
Hodgsons were very poor when little
Frances, a dreamy, original girl of six
toen, who had already written some lit
tle stories which had been published, and
who secretly cherished the ambition
which has been so splendidly realized, be
came acquainted with an equally poor
and unknown young man named Burnett.
Dr. Burnett at that time was a physi
cian duly licensed to practice in Tennes
see. He was poor, young, ardent and in
love. Ills practice was very small, and
medical compensation has never been too
generous In Tennessee; but love Is rich;
and so it came about that Frances Hodg
son was one day made the happy bride
of the struggling young physician.
Years of Wedded Life,
Then They Parted
|K5kU. BURNETT was especially fasci
Â£ by the study of the eye, and
a consuming desire to go to the
great hospitals in Europe and fit
himself to be a specialist, in his chosen
field. His young wife shared his ambi
tion, and it was in an effort td help her
husband earn the money to realize his
cherished hope that she undertook to
write a story for publication.
This story, timidly offered to a magazine
editor, was "That Las 3 o' Lowrle's," a
novel whose characters were drawn from
her childhood recollections of her early
,home in the English mining region. The
story immediately brought the writer rec
ognition, fame and money. It was this
money, so fairly earned, that enabled Dr.
and Mrs.- Burnett to go to London, where
they remained two years, at the end of
which time the physician was regarded as
a master of his specialty, as he is to this
day.
Thereafter the couple lived much in
Washington, where ''Through One Ad
ministration" and "Little Lord Fauntle
roy" were written, and where Mrs. Bur
nett gained the information used in her
latest book, "In Connection with the De
WUloughby Claim."
In ISSS it was reported that Dr. and Mrs.
Burnett had parted, but this rumor was
emphatically denied by both husband and
wife, and the actual separation did not
occur until several years later. Then,
without suggestion of scandal or wrong
on either side, it became known that the
MRS FRANCES HODGSON BURNETT-TOWNSEND.
CALIFORNIAN SPRING FETES.
RIVERSIDE is now beautiful and joyous in the
bustling gayety of a "street fair," the first ever
.held on this coast; and by the time that closes
Sacramento will be about ready to open another fes
tival of a similar nature to add to the frolic welcome
of the May.
A few years ago the State was noted for its mid
winter rose festivals, and it appeared for a time as if
in several localities these would become established
as annual fetes. The industrial depression resulting
from the panic of 1893, followed later by. the two
years of comparative drought, appears to have ren
dered these celebrations unprofitable, and accordingly
last winter there were but three or four of them in
the State. Now, with returning prosperity and abun
dant rains, the natural buoyancy of the spirit of the
people revives, and the fetes of the spring will doubt
less be among the most successful ever known.
At Riverside, we are told, the town is radiant with
banners, thronged with visitors from all parts of
Southern California, and has every prospect of a
week of bustling activity in which business and pleas
ure will be combined. The profit of the venture,
moreover, will not end with the trade of the festival
itself. A new attractiveness will have been given to
the city and its repute abroad will "have been aug
mented, so that the good effects will be far reaching
and long enduring, and, what is more, not Riverside
only but all Southern California will be benefited
by them.
The street fair at Sacramento will, of course, be
much larger and more elaborate in every way than
that which is now going on at Riverside. It is to be
more of a fair and less of a fete. It will not, perhaps,
have the floral beauty of the southern celebration, but
it will have a richer and more extensive display of
lights and banners and other artificial decorations.
From the preparations that have been made for it
each successive day of the fair will provide for the
people of Sacramento and their visitors an attraction
peculiar to itself. There is to be no monotony in the
week, and the event will doubtless prove one of the
notable successes accomplished in the way of open-air
entertainments on a grand scale in California.
The figures for the American guns do
not correspond with the latest report of
the Bureau of Ordnance of the United
States navy, which gives an energy of
65.221 foot tons, equal to 1019.6 foot tons
per ton weight of gun. Its penetrating
power at 3000 yards will be 17.92 inches of
Harveyized nickel steel armor, making it
vastly superior to. any srun yet built for
any other navy.
NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
The German navy is at present repre
sented in foreign waters by sixteen ves
sels and it is intended to, add five more
during the year.
A quick-firing gun of 7*4 inch caliber has
been made for the British navy and is to
be tried shortly. It will throw a shell
weighing 200 pounds.
The obsolete armorclads are being weed
ed out of the European navies. France
has relegated the Colbert, Richelieu and
Trident to harbor service; Germany _ re
cently condemned two old turret vessels,
and the Deutchland and Koenlg Wilhelm
will also soon retire from the effective
list. '
The floating dock at Havana is still un
disposed of, the private bidders having
failed to make good their offer. Spain has
again offered It to the United States at

the purchase and the dock Is likely to be
a dead loss to Spain.

ALONG THE YUKON TRAIL.
DAWSON appears to have profited to some ex
tent by the rush for Cape Nome. The event
has led to a considerable decrease of popula
tion without a corresponding diminution of supplies,
and consequently the town will not have to live on
Mafeking rations this spring. In fact, one of the local
papers recently said: "There is more beef now in
Dawson and coming in than can possibly be con
sumed before the arrival of warm weather will render
more or less of it unfit for use. Whether parties who
are handling beef have made or lost money, they had
much better put the price. down within the reach cf
every one than run the'risk of consigning large quan
tities to the river upon the break-up."
Beef, however, is not the only viand plentiful in'
Dawson. It seems a lot of luxuries have been going
in over the trail, but that sometimes they strike snags,
as it were, and then the way stations have festivals.
For example, a report from Skaguay of March 27
says: "Durand has reached Bennett and is on his way
to Dawson with 1000 quail and 400 pounds of frog
legs. As the latter are spoiling very rapidly, he sold i
a large part of his stock in Bennett yesterday, when
the whole town indulged in a frog-leg feast, the first
in its history."
Other reports are to the effect that Dawson is full
of men who stay there for.no other reason than that
they arc too proud to go home. In an extended re
view of the subject a Dawson journal says: "Many
men -who have not sufficient pride here to prevent
them from sleeping under crap tables have been 'high

ers of Maudslay Sons & Fields at Lambeth
no longer exists. The tools and other ap
purtenances were sold at auction during
the first week of this month and the un
filled contracts have been turned over to
the new works located at Greenwich. This
old marine engine firm has built engines
for every naval power except that of the
United States, and their machinery is to
be found in fully one-half of the world's
naval vessels built prior to 1890.
British manufacturers of armor plates
were unofficially encouraged last year by
Lord Goshen, First Lord of the Admiral
ty, to extend their facilities and they have
promptly acted upon the encouraging hint
of large orders. The three firms, all lo
cated at Sheffield, comprising Vlcker's
Sons & aiaxim, John Brown & Co. and
Charles Causswell & Co., have added im
provements to their plants involving an
outlay of $5,000,000, and are now prepared
to turn out 30,000 tons of armor per an
num.
The pay of German naval officers is
considerably lower than in the British
navy, but somewhat higher than in the
French. A German admiral of the fleet
receives a salary of 13000, which, with
table money and other allowances, makes
a total of $7900 annually. A captain's pay
is $1950; that of a lieutenant in command
Is $975, and chief inspector of machinery
afloat receives only $1650. The fleet sur
geon's pay is $1950. It is asserted that
during: the first ten years of a German
naval officer's career his income falls short
of his actual necessary expenditures by
$2500 and. as a consequence, only the rich
can afford to enter their sons as officers
in the imperial German navy.
That the French excel in the smaller
caliber guns is a fairly well established
fact, but the claim made for a better 12
inch gun than that of any other navy re
mains to be proved in actual practice, for
comparative data do not support the
claim. While the initial velocity is
greater in the French gun. the projectile
weighing only 645.8 pounds against the
British 850 pounds, the penetrating 1 en
ergy must therefore be much greater for
the British gun. The Engineer of recent
date contains the following Interesting
table of the principal armor-piercing ord

A RELAPSE IN MANUFACTURES.
' I "" KADh last week was rather quieter than usual.
The bank clearings of the country fell off 11.6
* per cent and the principal manufacturing towns,
such as Pittsburg, Fall River and the more important
New England centers, showed a decrease. In fact,
the manufacturer, who has enjoyed such an unprece
dented boom for a year or more, is now beginning to
talk about dullness and declining prices. The retailer
has found out that the general public cannot pay the
i-ery high prices for most commodities resultant from
the boom of 1899, and his method of informing the
wholesaler of this fact, though tacit, is none the less
vigorous. He simply cuts down his orders. The
... .. "
wholesaler at once reacts on the manufacturer, who
promptly curtails his production, and thus the boom
subsides like the gentle and noiseless subsidence of
1 row of bricks. This is well illustrated by the present
condition of the dry goods business. We are informed
by R. G. Dun & Co. that "a heavy wholesale business
has been done in dry goods, but the question is now
whether retail distribution will justify it. As yet re
turns are not satisfactory; there is an increase, but
not enough to warrant the buvine from mills."
The boot and shoe industry is another instance.
Some works are running half time and others are
closing altogether, because prices are higher than the
retailers (i. c., the public) are willing to pay. In the
iron trade new business is reported by the Iron Age
as "frightfully small." simply because buyers are more
and more convinced that the present high prices will
not last. Indeed, some weakness was apparent sev
eral weeks ago, and some lines declined slightly.
Hardware is the only branch of the iron and steel
. .....
trade to show any particular strength at the moment.
The cotton trade, like the iron trade, is active, but on
oid orders, new business being small. Rather mort
inquiry for raw wool is reported.
The lull in manufacturing industries is reflected in
Wall street, where many industrial stocks have lately
declined, liquidation in steel stocks having been a
prominent feature. On the other hand, some of the
railway stocks are doing better under larger sales.
Firmness of money in London and easiness in New
York is turning some gold from the latter to the
former market, and a shipment was made to Buenos
Ayres on European account last week.
General trade seems to be better here than in the
East. The Alaskan gold fields and Government or
ders keep certain lines of produce active in the local
market, and the Spanish war and the discovery of
gold up north seem to have been godsends to San
Francisco. Certainly the town has grown remark
ably in business, if not in population, since Dewey
destroyed the Spanish fleet in Manila Bay. It is
net the same town. It is livelier, larger and more
bustling; its streets and wharves, are more crowded,
and it never looked so much like a large city as it
does to-day.
The crop situation has undergone considerable
modification during the past week. Late rains have
benefited grain and vegetable crops, late frosts have
done more or less damage to orchard fruits an^ a
i'ood deal of mischief to grapes. Of fruits, peaches
nrc the leading sufferers, with apricots a close second,
>.vhile cherries, prunes and pears do not appear to
have been hurt much except in spots. However, it is
generally admitted that the fruit crop of the State
will not be as enormous as expected a month ago, and
it is probably a good thing. There will be fruit
enough.
WORSHIPS AND SEAMEN
ONLY a short time ago the Naval Committee
reported to the House of Representatives a
bill appropriating for the navy $61,000,000,
of which sum $28,350,000 is to be employed in
the construction of new ships, exclusive of ar
mor and armament. Now there comes a report
that the Navy Department is under the neces
sity of ordering the United States cruiser De
troit to the Portsmouth navy yard, New Hamp
shire, to go out of commission. In addition to this
orders have been prepared to put the Marblehead
out of commission at Mare Island, and telegraph or
ders have been sent to Admiral Watson to send the
gunboats Bennington and Concord, now at Manila,
to San Francisco, where they will also be put out of
commission. The big battleships Indiana and Mas
sachusetts, which have just been overhauled at the
New York navy yard, are to be sent to League Island
about the first of the month, to be laid up in ordinary
instead of being commissioned.
The reduction in the number of ships in commis
sion is said by the naval authorities to be due to a
lack of officers to take charge of them. Thus we are
told that for all of the four great guns in the double
turrets of the new battleship Kearsarge but one officer
could be spared, involving undue risk even in times
of peace. The Navigation Bureau is authority for
the statement that there are fully 160 vacancies in the
line of the navy, and the total number of officers is
really less than it was fifteen years ago, notwithstand
ing the great increase in the number of ships. The
projected shortening of the course at Annapolis pro
vided for in the impending naval bill would not sub
stantially relieve the situation in less than fifteen
years, so the officials are striving to find some method
for temporary relief, such, perhaps, as the graduation
of the Annapolis classes for the next two years one
year in advance of the usual time, or an authorization
for the immediate appointment to Annapolis of about
100 extra cadets.
We have, it appears, built up a navy faster than we
have supplied a force to make use of it. In the pro
gramme of the House bill it is purposed to construct
two seagoing battleships, three armored cruisers and
three protected cruisers. When they are completed
it will be necessary to put more ships out of commis
sion in order to supply officers for the new ones.
We shall thus have costly vessels rusting at their
moorings for lack of men to keep them in working
Under such circumstances it is clearly one of the
duties of American statesmanship to provide a way
for increasing the number of men available for naval
service, either as officers or as seamen. The plans
proposed for graduating cadets from Annapolis in
two years, or for adding to the number of cadets
there, may supply the officers immediately needed,
but nothing will ever give us an adequate naval
strength except the upbuilding of a merchant marine
which will fit thousands of young men for service at
sea. We can construct new ships more rapidly than
we can raise up trained seamen, and therefore the
merchant marine bill should accompany the naval ap
propriation bill as a part of a comprehensive plan for
establishing our prestige upon the- ocean.
TO CONCILIATE IRELAND.
A* CORRESPONDENT of the London Chron
icle, writing of the sentiment of the Irish peo
ple with regard to the visit of the Queen,
makes the very obvious point that if the visit "be lelt
to stand alone; if it be not followed up by wise and
conciliatory steps on the part of the English public
rather than the British Parliament, it will soon be
completely forgotten."
The writer commends the Queen's order for the
formation of a regiment of Irish guards, but claims
it must be regarded as an act of justice rather than
one of favor. ''For fifty years at least," he says, "one
fifth of the British army has been composed of Irish
men, but only eight foot regiments and four cavalry
regiments bear Irish names. It follows that more
than 30,000 Irish soldiers contribute to the reputation
of English and Scotch regiments. There are prob
ably not more than 6000 Scotch, by race, soldiers in
the British army, but they give their names to two
Guard, five Highland, one cavalry and two Lowland
regiments. There are consequently more Scotch regi
ments than Irish. Moreover, the popularity of their
names, the Gordons, the Camerons, Seaforths, etc.,
and the prominence given them in every campaign,
has produced an impression of military service far in
excess of the plain, simple truth. This would have
been very difficult if some Pitt had taken up the sub
ject of treating the Irish septs as he treated the Scotch
clans, and given the British army regiments desig
nated by the names of Kavanagh and O'Connor, Mac-
Mahon and O'Neill. The great part played by Irish
soldiers in English battles has, therefore, been an
unrecognized and unappreciated part, and for the
first time the public has been made acquainted with
the existence of an Irish brigade during the present
war in South Africa."
The establishment of a national regiment, composed
of three full battalions and having a strength of up
ward of 3000, officered by men of representative Irish
families, and intrusted with the permanent guard of
Dublin, but being at the same time attached to the
royal household guards, would, he says, have a strong
influence in promoting'a spirit of loyalty in Ireland;
but much more than that must be done to put an end
to the long antagonism which the Irish have felt
toward the empire. Military glory and court
pageantry can never make up for a lack of justice and
the absence of efforts to promote the material wel
fare of the people.
The Queen's visit and the establishment of a regi
ment of Irish guards will avail little, therefore, unless
they be supported by a comprehensive conciliatory
policy. Thus the writer says: "We must take a peo
ple as we find them if we wish to gain their good will
and esteem. It is no use investing the Irish with
qualities they do not possess, or expecting from them
the phlegmatic action of colder races. They have a
capacity for silent suffering and for relentless recol
lection of a grievance of which no other race seems
capable, but the task of removing the causes is not
beyond the means, while it is well worthy of the ends,
of English statesmen."
Whether the statesman equal to the task of, doing
justice to Ireland will come into power in time to
profit by the admiration which the skill of Lord Rob
erts and the valor of Irish officers and troops have
excited among the English people remains to be seen.
The time is certainly propitious to the adoption of a
just policy in dealing with Irish questions. The Lib
erals in England, remembering the teachings of Glad
stone, are evidently favorable to home rule at this
time, but they are not in power. It is. for Salisbury
to act. and upon his action will it depend whether the
Queen's visit becomes memorable as the mark of the
beginning of a new era for the United Kingdom or
be forgotten as a passing pageant of the time.

Among the miners a deep dissatisfaction prevails
with the Canadian mining laws and the Canadian of
ficials. The laws appear to be unjust, and the manner
of their enforcement is in many cases vorse. So
much has been said about corruption in American
official life, as compared with that of Great Britain
and British colonies, that it is worth noting, in this
connecton, that while Canadian officials have rendered
themselves liable to grave suspicions of corruption
and have given rise to discontent, the administration
in Alaska on the American side of the line has been
in every way satisfactory. Major Ray has performed
a difficult duty in a manner. which has won universal
commendation, and, by contrast with the course of so
many of the Canadian officers, his success is not only
creditable to himself but honors the Government he
serves.

British Ship Annie Thomas
Practically Griv,en Up
as Lost.
She Is Now Out 260 Days From Car
diff and It Is Feared That Her
Cargo of Coal Took
Fire.
The gamblers In reinsurance are getting
very much afrala of the chances they
have taken on the British ship Annie
Thomas. She Is now out 260 days from
Cardiff with a load of coal for Acapulco,
and so little do the underwriters think
of her chances of ever reaching port that
they are offering 93 per cent to reinsure
hull and cargo. Captain Meredith is well
known to the San Francisco shipping fra
ternity as a very careful and skillful navi
gator, while the Annie Thomas has al
ways been classed as one of the slowest
Â¦hips afloat. On that account quite a num
ber of people in this port have taken
chances on the overdue, and should she
arrive there will be much rejoicing on the
water front.
The Annie Thomas left Cardiff on July
29, and when S2 days out she had not
rounded the Horn. On that occasion she
was In latitude 67 degrees 25 minutes
south, longitude 70 degrees 30 minutes
west, and was reported with the loss of
her fore topmast. This was in October,
and during all of that month particularly
heavy weather was experienced off the
Horn. At one time there were over a
dozen disabled vessels in Port Stanley and
two of them have not yet reached port.
One of them, the Blackbraes, is now due
any day, while the other, the Musselcrag,
came by the way of Cape Hope and had
to put into Sydney, N. S. W., in distress.
The general supposition along the front
Is that the Annie Thomas was caught in
the October storms off the Horn and be
ing unable to make any headway Cap
tain Meredith made for the Cape of Good
Hope. That must have been 170 days ago
and the vessel has had ample time to
make port. Still she may be lying be
calmed in the Gulf of Panama, and In
that chance the gamblers take refuge.
Captain Meredith was last here in the
British ship Dominion. He left here to get
married and a new master sailed the ship
to Honolulu with a cargo of coal. From
Honolulu the Dominion sailed for Puget
Sound In ballast, and It is only now that
portions of her wreckage are beginning to
be picked up on Vancouver Island. The
captain and crew have never been heard
from since they left Hawaii.
After his honeymoon Captain Meredith
Joined the Annie Thomas and started on
this last ill-fated cruise.
Water Front Notes.
The whaling bark John and Winthrop
got away to sea again yesterday. She
started for Cape Nome with passengers
and cargo, but had to put back because
the deckload was too heavy and made
the vessel cranky. The deckload was re
moved and the vessel got away again as
quickly as possible.
The new schooner Churchill arrived
from Coos Bay yesterday. She was orig
inally built for a syndicate, but they ob
jected to the manner of her construction,
so A. M. Simpson took the cratt off their
hands. The Churchill will now run in the
coast lumber trade.
The battleship lowa and the French
cruiser Protet were both open to the pub
lic yesterday. Petersen's launches carried
a big crowd of people, the fact that both
vessels could be visited for one fare being
a great inducement to people to make the
trip. -: ; "-â¢Â¦:Â¦

bill were also to be "removable at pleas
ure." The principle of "rotation in of
fice" was thus introduced into Federal
politics. The evil tendency of the bill was
unperceived by most, but to Jefferson
and Madison and Calhoun It was clear.
The latter declared it "one of the most
dangerous ever passed" and destined to

The Slavery Question.
"When the constitution was adopted
there was no sectional division of opinion
respecting slavery. Every Southern mem
ber of Congress voted for the ordinance
of J7S7. which forever forbade slavery in
the Northwest Territory. Efforts to abol
ish the iniquitous foreign slave trade were
not confined to the North; before its final
prohibition in ISOS nearly every State hacl
passed laws, against it. Abolition socie
ties were found clurinpr the early- years
of the century In the States as far south
as Virginia. The American Colonization
Society, organized in ISI6. was composed
of Southern slaveholders, along with
Northern abolitionists. There was al
ways, even down to the Civil War, a large
Southern white population which neltht-r
owned slaves nor favored slavery. The
institution was found unprofitable In the
North, and gradually disappeared. Many
believed that, left to itself, it would fol
low the same course in the South when
the ocean traffic in slaves should have
been suppressed. There was a disposition
to regard the evil as temporary and to
treat it with leniency. As new States en
tered the Union the spirit of mutual con
cession which had created the constitu
tion led tr> a tacit understanding that thÂ»
existing "balance" between slave and free
territory should b* recnpnlzed and re
garded. Vermont and Kentucky. Indiana
and Mississippi, came in together.
But when Missouri in is:o asked to be
admitted, bringing slavery with her. It
was at once clear that the country was
sharply divided in respect to further ex
tension of the Institution, and especially
In respect to its recognition in the new-
Federal territory of the Louisiana pur
chase. It had in the meantime become
strongly intrenched in the cotton States,
as necessary to the culture of that im
portant crop, and the planters were
reaching out after more land. Any inter
ference with their Internal affairs they
regarded as a violation of the constitu
tional rights of the States. An acrid and
angry debate took place in Congress. A
House amendment prohibiting slavery in
the new State was voted down in the
Senate. The bill was lost, only to come
up again in the next Congress. Much bit
ter feeling was roused by the hot discus
sion which spread through many States.
Harsh charger, and mutual recriminations
were made. The South was overbearing
and Insolent, the Xcrth was bigoted and
Intolerant. It seemed at the time most
fortunate that a compromise measure,
warmly supported by the great Influence
of Henry Clay, averted the serious strife
which threatened. Maine was now ready
for Statehood. She was admitted as a
free State. Missouri came- in with slav
ery, but the bill Included a prohibition of
slavery in the remainder of the Louisiana
purchase north of the southern boundary
of Missouri, latitude 26 degrees 30 min
utes.
The Missouri compromise postponed for
a generation the great struggle with slav
ery, but wise men knew that it was a
postponement only, and that the act di
vided the country into opposing sections
ruled by conflicting and irreconcilable
principles. . Jefferson wrote April 22. 1S20:

The Election of 1824.
The campaign of 1524 has been called by
a discriminating writer one of the mist
Interesting in our history. It is certainly
a matter of great interest to know how
men will act when, without party organi
zations for focalizing political sentiment,
in the absence of great question* upon,
which persons must inevitably differ, and
under a constitution such a.s ours, they
are called upon to choose a responsible
head for a powerful state.
During the years of good feeling men
had congratulated themselves upon the
passing away of party strife and the
gathering of all In peace and harmony
within the Republican fold. But thvre
was never real harmony amonsj the po
litical leaders who sought place and
power. Party lines being effaced and po
litical principles not In dispute, men
ranged themselves under the personal
leadership of favorites and were known
by their namesâ "Adams men." "Cay
men," "Jackson men." Politics became a
contest between persons, rot principles.
As we have previously seen, the old
nominating machinery â the Concessional
caucusâ was just expiring, making In its
last throes a spasmodic effort in favor of
Crawford. Nothing had been accepted in
its place, and Presidential candidates for
this campaign were announced in various
irregular ways, here and there, for some
two years before the election took place.
Niles' Register tells us that in I<C2 thero
were sixteen or seventeen candidates.
Only four, howeverâ Clay. Crawfnrrt.
Adams and Jacksonâ finally received elec
toral votes, and no one obtained a ma
jority, though Jackson received a plural
ity of the popular and electoral vote,
while Calhoun. by an overwhelming ma
jority, was elected Vice President. The
House of Representatives was a second
time called upon to choose a President.
Clay, being fourth on the list, could not.
according to Â»the constitution, be voted
for.- and his electoral votes were given to
John Qulncy Adams, who thus became the
sixth President of the United States.
The peaceful period of Monroe's incum
bency was now followed by an adminis
tration full of troubled and stormy ex
periences. There was nc longer a lack of
questions for which it was worth while to
enter into party struggles. It soon ap
peared that the quiet era had brought
forth a plentiful crop and that new politi
cal sortings and adjustments were fast
gathering the national forces into oppos
ing parties.
IV. THE ERA OF GOOD FEELING.
(Continued.)
BY JESSE MACY, LL. D.
The Tariff.
The very first Congress of the United
States, which met In 1759. brought for
ward bills for the taxation of imports in
order to create a national revenue". The
discussion which preceded the passage of
a tariff act showed a difference of opinion
among the legislators in respect to the
wisdom of Imposing duties for the purpose
of protecting home industries, but neither
then nor till years after was the question
raised of the constitutional right of the
Federal Government to impose protective
duties. It was the universal practice of
the nations thus to protect their own pro
ducers. Our first tariff act, though a
revenue and not a protective tariff, rec
ognized the principle of protection in its
preamble. Hamilton and Jefferson held
similar views. There was no party di
vision upon the subject. The industries
of the new state, aside from ship-buiMlng
and transportation, were almost wholly
agricultural or crudely mechanic and the
products of the Boil paid for the manufac
tured goods which were Imported. With
the war of 1812 new conditions arose. The
various restrictive acts put in force led
to the ruin of American commerce. Manu
factures were established to supply thÂ«
goods which could no longer be readily
imported from foreign countries. The
duties upon Imports were doubled and un
der the stimulus thus afforded manufac
tures sprang up with great rapidity. The
close of the war and the removal of re
strictions upon trade threatened the new
enterprises with serious loss or ruin and
the tariff act of ISI6, providing for an in
crease of duties, was in- a measure a con
cession to their needs, though it was more
particularly designed to provide for the
heavy expenses of the war. After the
financial crisis of ISI9 a definite movement
arose in favor of Federal aid to manufac
tures, which would promote a desirable
diversification of industries, the revival of
business throughout the States and a rise
in the price of land and its products. Un
der the pressure of popular clamor Con
gress passed the tariff bill of 1524, which
marks the adoption of a positive protec
tive policy. The duties upon textile
fabrics were raised, as desired by New
England manufacturers, and upon iron,
lead wool and other articles produced
chiefly in the Middle and Western States.
The leading statesmen, irrespective of
party affiliations, favored the measure.
Party lines were drawn, as parties began
to rise out of the chaos of the period,
without reference to tariff questions.
Favorable results seemed to follow al
most Immediately upon the legislation of
1524. Trade revived and a tide of prosper
ity appeared to set in. If protection had
thus been proved good, would not more
protection be better? Manufacturers of
woolen goods had not received their fair
share of the increase of duty in 1524 and
they demanded higher rates. It began to
appear that sectional interests were deep
ly involved in the details of tariff legis
lation. Strong opposition to protection
grew up in the South and seltish greed
everywhere besieged Congress for action
favorable to its own business and its own
locality. Great pressure was brought to
bear upon public men, and as the Presi
dential campaign of IS2B drew on it be
came apparent that the tariff was to en
ter prominently Into party politics.
Origin of the Spoils System.
That political theory â¢ which maintains
the right of a successful party or faction
to use its power of appointment to and
removal from office to iurther selfish in
dividual or party interests, while the pub
lic welfare and the qualifications of can
didates become subordinate, has come to
be tersely named "the spoils system."
A President naturally gathers round
him as counselors and aids in carrying
out his official policy those who sympa
thize with that policy. He selects his
Cabinet members and appoints the Min
isters who will represent his administra
tion before foreign powers from those
holding political views similar to his
own. But there are many thousands of
inferior officers in the civil service who
have to do with the details of the execu
tive work of the great business of the
national Government. They carry out.
under instructions from their superiors,
the measures determined upon by the
responsible persons In the Government,
but are not in the slightest degree con
corned with the administrative policy It
self. It is of no consequence whatever
what- may be the political opinions of the
thousands of Custom-house officers, light
house keepers, postmasters, etc.. with
their innumerable subordinates, so long
as they are competent to perform the du
ties of their positions. They represent no
one and have no political responsibility
for their acts. There is no valid reason
for removing a Democratic postmaster or
clerk in the Treasury, for instance, to
make room for a Republican postmaster
or clerk when a Republican President la
sworn in. On the contrary", it is extreme
ly probable that the experienced official
is better qualified for his place than is
any raw hand. The rewarding of politi
cal party services by appointment to lu
crative office and the holding out the
hope of such reward as Inducement to
partisan effort have brought into Ameri
can politics such a train of evils as to
threaten the survival of our free Institu
tions.
For forty years no President was guilty
of basely prostituting his appointive pow
er to party purposes. Jefferson was ac
cused of having made partisan removals,
but the charge is not sustained. But
throughout Jackson's two terms of office
the civil service was openly made a party
engine under his avowed principleâ "To
the victors belong the spoils."
The way had been prepared by the
passage in IS2O of a bill drawn by Craw
ford, then Secretary of the Treasury and
a candidate for the Presidency, limiting
the term of a large number of interior
officials to four years. Before this the
term had not been fixed, and the object
of the new law clearly was to increase
the patronage to be disposed of. while its
immediate purpose was to gain votes for
Crawford. The officers mentioned in the
DEATH CLAIMS
ONE MORE OF
THE PIONEERS
Hippolite Dutard, Commis
sion Merchant, Passes
Away.
He Came to This City in 1849 "With
His Father, Who Established
the Business to Which
the Son Succeeded.
Â» Â¦ Â¦
Another member of the pioneer band
who helped to build up this city ? in early
days was summoned by death yesterday
morning, when Hippolite Dutard, one of
San Francisco's best-known commission,
merchants, succumbed to a disease with
which he had been afflicted,, during the
past ten weeks. The end came rather un
expectedly. Mr. Dutard's death was
peaceful, his sorrowing wife and several
relatives being present at his bedside.
Mr. Dutard was 67 years of age at the
time of his death. Previous to his last
illness he had enjoyed excellent health,
having experienced only slight attacks of
rheumatism. He was laid low by Bright's
disease. He had been confined to his bed
for the past ten days.
Mr. Dutard was born in Valparaiso,
Chile, in 1543, and camÂ© to this city in
1849 with his father, Bernard Dutard, who
established in 1552 the business which
rapidly assumed its present large pro
portions, and to which the son finally suc
ceeded. He was a member of the Cali
fornia Pioneers. Pacific Union Club, Pro
duce Exchange, Merchants' Association
and other representative bodies ,of this
city. Besides his wife Mr. Dutard
leaves a sister and two nephews, Leonce
and Walter Sheldon, who were identified
with their uncle's business at the corner
of Sacramento and Davis streets.
The funeral will take place from the
family residence. 2113 Pacific avenue, to
morrow afternoon at 2 o'clock. The fu
neral ceremonies will be brief and the in

LECTURED ON LIFE
BEYOND THE GRAVE
Rev. B. Fay Mills Treats of the Prob
lem of Immortality at Metro
politan Temple. ',-_;
Rev. Benjamin Fay Mills lectured last
evening In Metropolitan Temple under
the auspices of the Sunday Lecture Asso
ciation. His subject was "The Problem
of Immortality." In part he said:
Let me give you two reasons why f believe
that man lives beyond the jrrave:
The first reason Is what I am so fond of say
iny, that I believe this is a rational order.
It is an Irrational order if men are made merely
to tarry on this planet for a little time and
then to fade forever.
Nearly all the founders of religions have
tauÃht Immortality. Almost all the scriptures
of all the nations teach Immortality. Almost all
tKe Breat philosophers and scientists believe In
the Individual immortality, of the soul. It is not
something that belongs to one people and is
shut away from other people; it is one of the
universal beliefs in the world.
I believe in future life because I am alive
now. As Immanuel Kant said: "The highest
Kood practically 1b only possible on the sup
position of the immortality of the soul." Think
that out, and you will say amen. Lotze, the
great philosopher, says: "That will last forever
which on account' of * its excellence and its
spirit must be an abiding- part of the universe:
what lacks that preserving worth will perish."

PROMISE WEALTH
TO THE MINERS
Water Courses Have Enough
Supply to Make Good
Season Sure.
News From the Mineral Counties
Abounds in Evidences of Good
Prospects forDelvers for
Hidden Treasure.
The rain of the past week has been an
additional circumstance to Inspire the
miners of the northern counties with
hope. The people of the south were not
so lucky, but advices are that the out
look for sufficient water is very good in
many localities. The majority of north
ern points will have a fair supply. From
Calaveras County comes word that there
Is a depth of eight feet of snow in Bear
Valley and that the heads of the streams
seem to have an abundance of water. The
Calaveras Prospect says that a solid body
of snow extends down Â¦to Black Springs
and that on the summit, above Bloods,
It Is deeper and solidly packed. This is
the snow that fell early in the season and
one foot of it is worth fully five that falls
in March or April. Of course, there is no
radical change in the prospect for some
localities where the water has previously
been Â¦ reported to be very low. The camp
in greatest need of water is Randsburg.
The people down there have not given up
the tight by any means. In fact, work
Is proceeding night and day on a new
well that has a supposefl capacity of 100,
000 gallons per day. A stone reservoir to
hold 100,000 gallons has just been - com
pleted by the managers of the Yellow As
ter and so confident are they that they
have a good well that they have let a
contract for a pipe line nine miles long
and a pumping plant, the whole to cost
$55,000.
Another sign of promise during the
week is the case with wnich the Califor
nia Water and Forest Association. ha 3
been able to raise about $10,000 to co-op
erate with the United States Government
and the two California universities In ex
ploiting the water supply of California.
It will be recollected that the aim of the
association is the storage of ihe Mood wa
ters for the use of the miners as well as
the agriculturists. The Government has
agreed to co-operate in the work of map
ping the country in the mountain regions
to ascertain the best sites for the stor
age reservoirs. The field work will soon
be observed by the interested miners.
William Thomas, who is at the head of
the Water and Forest Association, says
that one section will be surveyed at a
time and that when it is fully rounded up
any Intelligent person will be able to see
at a glance where the available storage
sites are. Some time In the future the
work of the association will play a large
figure in furnishing a reliable supply of
water when It is most needed by both the
miner and the farmer. The creation of
great reservoirs will also multiply the
available power that can be electrically
developed for the benefit of the miners.
The Senatorial bill giving aid for the
establishment and maintenance of mining
schools has been reported by the Senate
Committee on Mines and Mining in a
modified form. It now provides for an
annual appropriation of $10,000 for each
school of mines in connection with a State
college or university, the money to be de
rived from the sale of public lands, and
the amount to be increased until it
reaches $20,000 per annum. The Congress
men from the mining States and Terri
tories will undoubtedly work for the suc
cess of the measure, which was fathered
by Senator Chauncey Depew of New
York.
United States engineers and others fig
ure that in parts of California's foothills,
notably near the Forest Hill divide, in
Placer County, there are great gold
placers to be mined by the drift method,
the gold to be got out from under the
lava. The channels of the old rivers un
der this capping are supposed to be much
richer than the modern rivers and placers,
that yielded a thousand million dollars In
gold. This is because the channels of the
ancient rivers served as bedrock sluices
for untold ages before the disturbing lava
flows began.
The miners of San Gabriel Canyon have
organized under the name of the South
west Miners' Association Auxiliary No. 1.
The purpose was declared to be the unit
ing of all the mining interests of the
Southwest, including Arizona and New
Mexico, also to prepare . permanent
mineral exhibits, interest capital in min
ing enterprises, favor uniform and ade
quate laws to govern mining and mineral
claims and to encourage the development
of the mining industry In every legitimate
way. The following names of miners
were enrolled as members of Auxiliary
No. 1: F. C. Spence, George Gorman, G.
W. Flley. D. H. Beaty. S. F. de Voin, J.
A. Metcalfe, V. Metcalfe. James Neal, W.
S. Bridges, R. M. Follows, Evan Davis,
W. T. Heaton. G. M. Cake, W. G. Pot
ter, J. McCaslin, Jonas Murray, Charles
Hogan, J. D. Osborne, Jose Maria, James
Williams. James Everhardy, James Mc-
Grestln, V. M. Greever, T. B. Persinger,
Ben Heaton, Hayes Potter, Fred Thorp,
W. M. Potter. Marlon Herrln, A. A. Rus
sell, C. Rodriguez.
The Etna Advance says that mining
operations In Trinity and Siskiyou coun
ties have, in the main, settled lown to a
steady, solid basis. The mines are being
worked on assured lines and the season's
output will justify the general satisfaction
now felt.
In notices of forfeiture to joint owners
for non-payment of necessary annual as
sessment work upon unpatented mining
claims the notice must be published for
sfj days and the party so notified has 90
days after the last publication to pay up.
The copper mines of California are of
greater value to the wage-earners of the
coast than those yielding the precious
metals, as they require a larger number
of hands to work In the stones and around
the smelters. The extraordinary activity
at present in copper mining here Is con
sequently one of the best signs of the
times In California mining development.

REV. GEORuri C. ADAMS.and during the services in the churches
with beautiful women, resplendant fn,
their Easter hats and gowns, presenting a
dazzlingly brilliant appearance as they
promenaded the thoroughfare, enjoying
the bright sunshine and the consciousness
of the admiration they created.
Not a seat was to be had. in St. Mary's
Cathedral when the hour arrived for the
U o'clock mass. Late comers were satis
fied to stand throughout the impressive
services and the entrance to the church
was made impassable. So dense was the
crowd that many gave up the hope of
getting close enough to hear ; the singing
of the mass and the instrumental music.
Solemn high mass was celebrated at 11
o'clock, with the Rev. J. J. Prendergast,
V. G., celebrant; Rev. J. B..Hannlgan,
deacon, and Rev. C. A. Ramm, sub-dea
con. Rev. E. P. Dempsey â¢delivered the
discourse, which was forcible and elo
quent. His clear enunciation made It pos
sible for people at the entrance of the edi
fice to hear every word he uttered. In the
course of his sermon he said': ' ' :
"If Christ be not risen from the dead,
then our preaching is vain and your faith
is also vain; for- if we -forget the great
turth of divinity, if we fall to. realize that

raise all the necessary funds for that pur

large class of children and delivered an
excellent confirmation address to the lit
tle ones. Â¦Â¦ Â¦;â¢ . Â¦-:â¢Â¦
In the absence of Rev. .Robert Macken
zie of the First Presbyterian Church, who
is in New York, his assistant. Rev. Wil
liam Kirk Gutherie, D. D., conducted tho
services. Dr. Gutherie said the resurrec
tion loomed up larger than any other sub
ject in the whole world on Easter Sunday,
and yet 1900 years ago there was not one
human being who believed it possible. He
traced the death and the resurrection of
Jesus and. then described the incidents
that surrounded it.
The First English Lutheran Church
was overflowed at both services. An ex
cellent musical programme and sermon by
the pastor. Rev. E. Nelander, were en
joyed by the congregation. Dr. Nelander
spoke on "The Resurrection, a Practical
Force." He said in part: "The doctrine
of the resurrection carries in it all the
reÃt of our religion. The truths of Chris
tianity form a golden chain, and the re
surrection is the first link. It confirms
our faith in the ultimate triumph of Jesus
Christ. When Christ was crucified it
seemed that while all the vices were be
ing crowned In Rome all the virtues were
being crucified in Jerusalem. But wren
Jesus burst forth from the grave he pi-o
claimed the victory of truth and goodness.
The value of Christ's resurrection is this:
"It bridges earth and heaven; it roots our
life In the risen Christ, and puts the full
ness of heaven at our disposal." .
Rev. H. H. Bell, pastor of the First
United Presbyterian Church, spoke in the
morning on the theme "That Empty
Tomb." His text was Mark xvi:6. In part
he said:
"That empty tomb also means that the
Christian religion is impregnably estab
lished ; that religion rests upon an up
lifted cross and an emptied tomb. Fur-

ELECTRIC WIRE
CAUSES DEATH
OF A WORKMAN
Daniel Murphy Is Instantly
Killed at the Oakland
Ferry Depot.
Â«
Two Others Employed With Him In
a Steel Caisson Overcome by
Gas and Have Nar

Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1118 Broadway. April 1j-
While working on a foundation for
water tanks at the Oakland broad-gauge
ferry depot to-night, Daniel Murphy was
killed by a shock from a live electric-llÃnt
wire, attached to a portable lamp, whicn
he was carrying, in the big steel tan^
where he waa laboring. Fellow workmen
heard him scream, and then the sound of
his body as it struck the bottom of the
caisson. Peter Giustl and John Smith
rushed to the rescue, but both men were
suddenly overcome, it U supposed, by
gases in the tank. Smith waa dragged
out unconscious by other workmen, but
revived after he got to fresh air. Giustl
managed to get out unassisted.
Murphy's body was hauled out of the
tank, but there was no sign of life. Phy
sicians pronounced the man to be dead.
None of the workmen at the pier could
explain the cause of the accident. A gangf
of men had been working at night on the
Job in order to hasten operations so thera
would be no interference with boat travel.
Concrete piers were being sunk for water
tanks to be tilled for supplying the ferry
boats with fresh water. The piers ara
beneath the surface of the water, and to
carry on the work large caissons were
built. It was in one of these that the
gang of laborers of which Murphy was
one had been at work this evening.
In order to have light, wires were strung
from the main circuit to the scene of ope
rations, which waa near the depot slip en
trance, close to the apron. Â¦ Incandescent
lamps of high power were strung on these
wires, arranged so that workmen coula
carry' them about.
Murphy had been standing on a plat
form a minute before he started to de
scend a ladder to work In the caisson.
One hand came in contact with the light
wire and the other hand must have com
pleted the circuit by striking on some
metal about the tank. Everything was
damp about the place, increasing the
danger from electricity. He fell into a
foot of water that was In the bottom of
the tank. -Â¦â¢"'
The Coroner took charge or Murphy 3
remains, which were removed to the
Morgue. There did not appear to be any
marks about the limbs or body to indi
cate where the heavily charged wire came
into contact with the man. Murphy waa
forty years old. unmarried, and resided
at 1812 Seventh street. He has a brother.

to beautiful thoughts and grand music in
honor of the occasion. Priests and minis
ters retold the story of the crucifixion and
the resurrection, and drew object lessons
therefrom, while augmented choirs and
orchestras rendered the compositions of
inspired musicians.
It was the one day in the year that
every Christian deemed It his or her duty
to attend divine services, and the major
portion went purely out of religious feel
ing.
The decorations of the altars and pul
pits were, as usual, simple but beautiful.
In the Catholic churches the altars were
covered with white roses, lilies and palms,
and scores of lighted candles added to the
pleasing effect. Churches of other denom
inations also presented a pleasing appear
ance. Lilies of the valley. Easter lilies,
ferns and cut flowers completely hid . the
carved woodwork. Suspended . over the
chancels were crosses of lilies and on
either Bide were stately palms. The spe
cial musical programmes rendered in the
various churches and the selected choirs
crowned their long and continued practice
by doing complete . justice to the noble
compositions.

MOROSCO'S NEW COMPANY
SCORES A GREAT HIT
Performance of "An Arabian Girl"
Bich With Color and Mer
riment.
"Standing: room only" was the order of
the night at the Grand Opera-house last
evening, though the words were not
strictly truthful In this instance, for there
was not even standing room when the
curtain rose on the first performance of
"An Arabian Girl and the Forty Thieves."
The magnitude of the audience was only
equaled by the size of the production,
which was on a quite magnificent scale
and noteworthy as much for the elaborate
scenery and costuming as for the gener
ous supply of principals and supernumer
aries.
There was an abundance of color In the
many scenes of the four acts and much
ther still, that empty tomb means the
final emptiness of every human tomb. It
means a final grave-opening day, when
earth's buried millions shall, come forth
for final review and reward. Let none of
us fall to prepare for that coming day.
â¢He that belleveth in me hath everlasting
life, and I will raise him up at the last
day.' "
A special service was held In the even
ing at Trinity Church, at which the Cali
fornia Commandery attended in a body.
The service opened by the choir singing
In a processional "Onward, Christian bol
diers." The Rev. Frederick Clampett
preached. the sermon. His text was taken
from the seventh verse of the twenty
eighth chapter of St. Matthew. At the
close of the service the knights made the
declaration of faith.
Golden Gate Commandery PÂ»o. 18,
Knights Templar, marched in a body to
the evening services of the First Presby
terian Church. The sermon was preached
by the Rev. W. Kirk Guthrie. He spoke
about the great anniversary they cele
brated, and said that he was proud to see
so many present who by bearing the cross
on their cloaks professed Christianity.
The Knights Templar were under the
command of J. C. Campbell.
In his sermon to his congregation the
Rev. E. A. Woods of the First Baptist
Church said:
"Let us thank God that far and wide
the tidings have gone forth this morn-
Ing 'The Lord is risen.' May the risen
one be enshrined in our hearts â a glori
fied Lord in the midst of a redeemed peo
ple. Let Easter remind us not of graves,
but of the gates of heavenâ those gates
whose keys love keeps on that side and
on this side â death."
The Howard-street Methodist Episcopal
Church was crowded with non-members
at both services yesterday. Members of
the Tivoll Opera-house Company assisted
the choir and an orchestra of fifteen
pieces discoursed sacred music. Rev.
John A. B. Wilson preached both morning
and evening on subjects appropriate to
the day.
CHRIST Is risen! Thousands of peo
ple sang out the glad tidings with
exultant voices throughout the city
ysterday. In every church the de
vout knelt In prayer and poured
forth their acknowledgment of the glo
rious message, while overhead the Easter
bells pealed forth Joy and consolation. It
was a glorious day, and morning, after

WIERD STORY OF
MIDNIGHT RAID
OF HIGHWAYMEN
Visitor From Across the
Bay Falls Among the
Philistines
Walter F. Sachs Tangled In a Lower
Broad-way Melee Finds Himself
a Prisoner in Oakland's
City JaiL
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, April 15.
â¢ Walter F. Sachs, the son of a prominent
San Francisco capitalist, residing at 1607
Scott street, San Francisco, was arrested
early this morning: by Deputy Constabla
Robinson while running away from pur
suing policemen on lower Broadway.
The young man was taken to the City
Prison and held for Investigation, a
charge of drunkenness being subsequent
ly registered against him. Xoung Sachs
told a story, of taking a late boat across
the bay, meeting a couple of strangers
whom he saw rob a saloon. He declared
he had been relieved of considerable
money by the unknown men, with whom
he had a fight which led to police inter
ference.
About 2 o'clock this morning Robinson
and several policemen heard whistles
blown vigorously In the vicinity of Sixth
street and Broadway. Robinson headed
off three men who were running down
Sixth street. Two of the fleeing. men es
caped, the third being young Sachs.
After his arrest an effort was made to
trace the circumstances which formed
Sachs' story, but to no purpose. Xo sa
loon-keeper reported any robbery, and the
only troub.'e which occurred about the
time of the arrest was a fight in a Broad
way lodging-house. The police said It
was thils row in which Sachs had been
mixed, although he was unable to tell
anything about his supposed footpad
companions.
When Sachs was taken into custody he
had a watch and chain and some small
pieces of jewelry on his person, but only
a nickel in coin. He was considerably
tangled concerning the method by which
his money was taken, and the police are
very doubtful that he suffered any seri
ous financial loss.
Having no means by which to notify
his relatives across the bay, the young
man passed Sunday in Jail.

REFUSES TO ATTEND
THE DEWEY DAY FETE
Spanish. Minister at Washington De
clines the Invitation of
Chicago.
CHICAGO, April 15.â Graeme Stewart,
chairman of the Invitation committee of
the Chicago Dewey Day Association, to
night expressed surprise at the attitude of
the Spanish Minister, Duke d'Arcos, who
is reported to have written a letter declin
ing an invitation to be in Chicago on the
anniversary of the battle of Manila. Mr.
Stewart said that invitations had been
sent to President McKinley and his
Cabinet, all the members of Congress,
members of tue Supreme Court and the
diplomatic corps. To have omitted any
one would have seemed Invidious and
would have constituted reasonable
grounds for taking umbrage. Mr. Stew
art said there was no intention to offend
the Duke and he regrets very much that
the Spanish Minister feels affronted.

Little Florence Pasmo, aged 7 years,

from the effects of burns she received
yesterday afternoon by her dress acci
dentally catching fire while she was play
ing around a bonfire.
The child, with some companions about
her own age, was setting grass afire in
a vacant lot at Fifth and Chester streets.
While dancing around the flames the little
girl's dress ignited, and in a second her
garments were ablaze. Her playmates
could not smother the burning clothing,
although they rolled the girl over In the
damp grass.
Her screams of pain startled the neigh
borhood, and several people rushed to the
spot and managed finally to extinguish
the flames with blankets, but not until
she had been fatally burned. One of the
first persons to attempt to save the girl
was 'her aunt, Mrs. V. B. Dlmmlck, but
the sight overcame the woman and she
was attacked wUh a severe case of hys
teria. The child was taken home and
immediately attended by Dr. "W. K. San
born. â¢ Temporary alleviation of her In
tense pain was all that could be done.
The little sufferer was frightfully burned
on the body, and her face was badly
cooked. The shock was so great that
after several hours of Intense suffering
the Injured child died.
She was an orphan," and had been re
siding with Mrs. R. Knuth, a grand
mother, since her parents' death.
The Coronor took charge qf the case,
calling an Inquest for to-morrow.

PLACER OIL MEN
LEARN PUNS Of
THE SCRIPPERS
The Contest Between Two
Classes of Claimants Is .
Near to Climax.
Chairman Wright of Committee on
Legislation of California Miners'
Association Criticizes Proposed
Amendment to Petroleum Law.
The controversy between the placer lo
cators of oil lands and the "scrlppers" is
growing more bitter. The miners having
taken measures to have the law amended,
the "scrippers" have also had an amend
ment drawn, which is entitled "Proposed
amendment to proposed act of Congress,
recommended by the California Miners'
Association and by the Petroleum Miners'
Co-operative Association, entitled 'A bill
to amend the petroleum act approved by
the President February 11, 1897. * " The ex
tent of the interests at stake warrants
the publication of this proposed amend
ment in full. It Is as follows:
At .the end of section 1 of said proposed,
bill Insert the following:
Provided, however, that the provisions of
this act shall not Inure to the benefit of
any placer mining location. If It be rfttown
that the locators thereof, or any of them,
have, during the current or preceding cal
endar year, located or been parties to any
location .of other placer mining ground
within the same mining district or
within the same township; and provided,
an individual or as a member of an asso
ciation of persons, locate as petroleum
lands, or be a party to the location of more
than one petroleum claim In any one min
ing district or township: and provided,
further, that this law shall not Impair or
affect any adverse rights that may have
attached to lands affected hereby before the
passage of this act: and provided, further,
that the notice of location hereinbefore re
quired to be filed In the local land office
shall be accomsanled by the affidavit of
each of the parties named therein as lo
cators, to the effect that he has personally
been over the land In question and care
fully examined the same; that he believes
said land contains petroleum or other min
eral oils, or other valuable hydro-carbons
In profitable quantities, and that he Intends
In good faith to explore and develop the
same, as required by law, for Its petroleum,
mineral oil or other hydro-carbons, and that
he has not been a party to any other pe
troleum placer location In the mining dis
trict or township In which said location Is
made during the current or Drecedlne cal
endar year, and that such location Is made
In good faith for his own use and benefit,
and not for thÂ« use or benefit of any other
person whatsoever, and is not for specu
lative purposes.
The most casual glance will show any
one familiar with the facts that this pro
posed amendment Is charged with explo
sives from the start to the finish. It Is
attributed to Shirley C. Ward. Fuel Is
added to the fire by a statement made in
a southern paper in the same connection
that in Kern County within a year 103
persons have located 5243 placer petroleum
mining claims of twenty acres each, an
average of over eighty claims, or 16P0
acres to the person, or a total of 164.9C0
acres. Five persons, it is alleged, have be
tween 200 and 250 claims, seven have be
tween 150 and 203 claims, thirteen have be
tween 100 and 150 claims, forty-one have
between 50 and 100 claims and thirty
seven have between 30 and 50 claims. Some
figures of the same sort are also made to
apply to Fresno County.
John M. Wright of the California Min
ers' Association, chairman of the commit
tee on legislation, has made the following
statements:
Placer miners have always been per
mitted to make as many placer loca
tions as they saw fit and could sus
tain. The aim of the proposed amend
ment is to limit the placer locator to
one location in any one township or
mining district, and that would let the
"scripper" grab all the remainder. The
provision that every person shall per
sonally examine the land In question
and make personal affidavit that ho
has done so is impractical. Judge
Wright attacks the provision that the
affidavit shall set forth that the loca
tion is made only for "his own use
and benefit" as equally absurd. From
all of which it will be seen that there
will be much more fighting between
the placer locator and the "ecripper."
The placer locators assert that the
â¢railroad company Is back of most of
the scripping.
The oil business in Los Angeles has not
been unmixed profit. On excellent local
authority it is taid that of the wells put
down by the Union Oil Company on the
south side of First street, one-half were
never pumped at a profit, and west of
Alvarado street, where some of the best
wells in the district are now located, the
same company made an expensive experi
ment but got no oil. On the other hand,
the first wells in the vicinity of the
Union-street School-house, south of First
Btreet, were drilled contrary to the ad
vice of the "old stagers," by men who
had no experience in the oil business or
were termed "oil cranks." The exact lo
cation of the oil strata was pointed out
by one of these supposed visionaries many
months before a successful well was
struck oa First street. Ventura County
oil has been found by tunneling into the
mountains and letting the oil flow out by
gravity. One man was offered $100,000 for
such a tunnel. The Bakersfleld Callfom
ian says that there has been only one
failure on account of a dry well In the
Kern River oil district. The Sunset Tele
phone Company and the telephone line of
the oil men's corporation in the Sunset oil
district will compete for business.
A H. Ricketts. reviewing the placer
mining law and its application to the oil
locations, writes: "The rights of the oil
miners are now determined by the rules
that govern a placer claim, located for
building stone, though the one requires
the drilling through of exploratory holes,
perhaps hundreds of feet in depth, or the
running of a tunnel to a great length to
demonstrate its value, while the other is
merely quarried. The oil claim is put
upon the same plane as a claim having a
superficial auriferous deposit, the value of
which can be proven with little outlay
and money. This Is clearly unjust to the
oil miner, being In utter disregard of the
conditions which surround him."

FLYCASTERS COMPETE
UNDER GOOD CONDITIONS
Golcher Oasts a Fly One Hundred and
Three Feetâ Mansfield Also
Scores.
There was not so large an attendance
yesterday at Stow Lake as usual to take
part in the fly-casting competition. This
condition was possibly due to the fact that
a number of rod-wielders visited the near
by trout streams instead. The day was
perfect for casting and the scores, al
though not high, averaged well. Golcher
was high man in distance with 103 feet to
his credit, while Mansfield carried off the
honors In the other events. The scores
follow:

Last Minute team In a hotly contested
game. Ten innings were necessary, and
at the conclusion the score stood 4 to 3,
in favor of the West Ends. "Speck."

was in a measure responsible for the de
feat of the Last Minutes.

two home runs. Symond will In all proba
bility be offered a position with the minor

catcher; Meyer, first base; Tillson, second
bnse; McGeorge, third base; Scanlon,

Dr. Powers on Socialism.
. Dr. D* Arcy Powers , addressed the So

problems. The hall was well filled with
men, with a fair sprinkling: of women.
The principal topic of Dr. Powers' address
was "Steps at a Time." He took, the
ground that people who. advocate that the
advance toward socialism should-be made
etep by step are wrong. The new state
of affairs ought to be Drought about by
a sudden upheaval and overthrow of the
present condition of affairs. There ought
to be no way stations along the line, but
the matter ought, to be settled at once. ' . :

was ; made ; by the man 'at work on the
floor overhead.

SEVEN SCORCHERS WERE
ARRESTED IN THE PARK
James Stanley and Wife Have a Nar
row Escape From a
Runaway.
Yesterday was an ideal "Park Day,
and the broad green lawns and gravel
walks in the vicinity of the band stand
presented both an animated and pretty
scene. Ladies In new Easter bonnets and
handsome gowns, accompanied by their
male admirers, were to be found at every
turn. Swell equipages and smart rubber
tired buggies were in a continual stream
on the main boulevard that extends to the
ocean. Even the peacocks seemed to real
ize the Importance of the day and strutted
around, admired by all who saw them.
The two police officers mounted on bicy
clesâOfficers J. Ahem and C. J. Birdsallâ
had a hard time of it. They reported at
Golden Gate Park early in the day, and
then their troubles began. They were de
tailed to keep aspiring Zimmermans down
to a ten-mile gait on the roads and by
ways of the park, and from Indications of
the register at the Park Police Station
they both earned their salaries yesterday.
They arrested seven small boys yesterday
and placed them in durance vile, and sev
eral Irate renters of wheels called at the
station to get their bicycles out for fresh
victims, but without success. The sprint
ers who were arrested were Charles
Kaden, Fred Smith. Joe Espinosa, Joe
Grennan, Robert McGillan and George
Mahon.
James Stanley, accompanied by his wife,
In the afternoon was enjoying the beauties
of the park behind a fast trotter, when
one of the shafts of the buggy broke.
The morbidly inclined spectators antici
pated seeing a gory accident. They were
disappointed, as Mounted Officer Chris
Arellanes arrived on the scene at $he
critical moment and grasped the bridle of
the horse in the nick of time.
The results of the aquatic sports at Su
tro baths were as, follows: The special
50-yard race between F. A. Walse, cham
pion swimmer of the coast, and C. Dono
van, champion of Alameda. was won by
the former Jn 45 seconds; trick and fancy
spring board divingâ C. Sunburg first, F.
Bogan second; under-water swimming
contestâ J. A. Jackson first, J. Finney
second.
CAPTAIN BOHEN
WILL FORMALLY
RETIRE TO-DAY
His Successor Will Probably
Be Captain John Sey
mour.
Other Appointments Are to Be Made
and Important Changes Are
Mentioned as Soon to
Occur.
The Police Pension Commissioners will
meet this afternoon at 4:30 o'clock to re
ceive the reports of the examining physi
cians, Drs. Mahoney and Terrill, on the
seven men slated lor retirement at the
regular quarterly meeting two weeks ago.
They are Captain Bohen. Detective Sll
vey, Sargeants LÂ»indheimer and Shields
and Patrolmen Daniel Coleman, John M.
Morton and Daniel McNelll. and their du
ties will cease after to-day.
The board will also discuss the advisa
bility of asking the majority of the thirty
men retired by. their predecessors pre
vious to going out of office to go before
the examining physicians to determine
whether they are unfit j for active duty.
It is no secret that Chief Sullivan is sat
isfied that more than one should be com
pelled to return to duty.
It is expected that after the retirements
are formally made this afternoon the Po
lice Commissioners will appoint Captain
John Seymour chief of detectives, while
the vacant captaincy made by the retire
ment of Bohen will be filled by the pro
motion of Lieutenant Esola. A lieutenant
to fill the vacancy caused by the promo
tion of Esola will also probably be ap
pointed, and there is much speculation as
to the lucky man.
It is considered probable that Esola
after his promotion will remain at the
California-street station and that the City
Prison will be placed in charge of a lieu
tenant instead of a captain as heretofore.
It is also on the cards that when the head
office is removed to the Hall of Justice,
June 1, the district now in charge of Cap
tain Wlttman will be divided, Wittman
having one section and Esola the other.
The district is double the size of any of
the others and is considered too exten
sive for one man's supervision. There is
another rumor in circulation to the effect
that after June 1 there will be a change
of the captains from one district to an
other.
As soon as the new head of the detec
tives takes office Chief Sullivan will, it
Is anticipated, announce the changes in
the "upper office" staff. Several of the
detectives are on the ragged edge and
uncertain, while others are hugging them
selves In the belief that they are all right.
WENT GUNNING FOR
A SALOON KEEPER
Private Kane Raised Trouble With
His Rifle and Bayonet Until a
Guard Got Him.
There was a hot time just outside the
Presidio gate last Friday that has cul
minated In serious charges being filed
against Henry F. Kane, erstwhile of Com
pany M of the Ninth Infantry, but now of
Convalescent Company No. L The end of
it will probably be the discharge of Kane.
Kane, with the remainder of the garri
son, was paid last Thursday, and before
night he had managed to pick a row with
Crowley of White & Crowley's saloon,
near the post gate. Friday night, with
the memory of his wrongs still strong
upon him and himself considerably under
the influence of liquor, he rose from % his
bunk after taps, and taKing his rifle and
belt from the rack tilled his magazine and
belt with ball cartridges and sallied forth
to find Crowley. He went into the sa
loon, but Crowley was not there, so Kane
offered to shoot any one who was handy
and willing to answer him back. No one
took up the dare, but one of the bystand
ers ran Into the post guard house and
called out the guard. A squad was sent
after Kane, but instead of arresting him
the guard took his rifle and cartridges and
let him go.
After the guard had gone Kane went
up the street to a saloon kept by a man
named Collins, and with his bayonet he
attempted to clean the place out. In the
meantime, however, the guard had re
turned to the guard house, and being un
able to show the bayonet among the arms
taken from Kane went back to get it.
Kane was caught before he had done any
harm and taken in.

LOUIS KLEE, WHO IS WANTED BY HIS CREDITORS
Â«7T? HOST of anxious creditors has
/l_\ been hovering about the bottling
Jl \ works of the Aetna Mineral \Va-
tcr Company at â¬04 Bryant street
yearning for an Interview with Louis
klee. who in letters a foot high painted
on the front of the building proclaims
himself "United States Agent" for the
liquid. Mr. Klee is missing. He has not
lioen seen about the establishment for
several days. His brother-in-law, Julius
JJaumgar'.en. says he has fled with a gay
widow, whose name he does not know,
after sending his young wife and child to
the home of his father-in-law in Pleas
antnn. Alameda County. Although his
creditors are numerous and the amount
of their claims is by no means inconsid
erable, Len D. Owens, who owns the
epringrs, says that none of the creditors
to whom. Klee is indebted in connection
with the mineral water business will suf
ier. as he intends to make good their de
mands.
There is something peculiar in Kiel's
actions In connection with the strange In
terest his wife's relatives are taking in
the affair. Charles Linn, who was for
merly Klee's partner and suplied the
money which started the young man in
business, says that he believes the whole
affair is a scheme to defraud him out of
the amount owed him by Klee and for
which he holds a chattel mortgage on the
prorÂ»erty of the Aetna agency. Mr. Linn
asserts that Jt is his belief that the story
of Klee having left the city with a mys
terious widow was concocted by th*
brother-in-law. Julius IJaumgarten, for a
motive. He says he has information that
Klee is in tiiding. in Ban Francisco and
wi!l remain in seclusion until his rela
tives manipulate his business affairs,
Â¦when he will come from cover and laugh
at Ms creditors.
Linn is involved in the matter to the
*>xtent of several thousand dollars. He
proposes to block any attempt to defraud
him by appealing to the authorities. He
has learned that just previous to his dis
appearance Klee assigned one-third of his
business to a man named Philips and an
other third to his wife.
Lon Owens stated yesterday that Klee
had departed and that he did not expect
he would ever return. He said he had
placed perfect confidence in the young
man and despite the stories that had
reached him, believed he was honest and
upright until the questionable action of
the past week. Mr. Owens will com
mence an investigation of the affairs or
the agency early in the week.
This is not the first escapade of a simi
lar nature in which Klee has figured.
About three years ago he was lpcated in
Pleasanton, Alameda County. He becamt
connected with an athletic organization
known as the Bohemian Club, which gave
an entertainment for the purpose of rais
ing funds to purchase apparatus. He
handled the cash. When the affair was
over he confessed that he had appropri
ated the proceeds to his own use and
begged for time to settle up, which was
granted. He took advantage of the oppor
tunity and one night hired a rig from a
Pleasanton livery stable and left town.
About a week later the liveryman re
ceived his rig back by freight, charges
collect, and Klee has not visited Pleasant
on since. Â¦ Â¦Â¦-Â¦^.Â¦â¢Â¦-' fv

HUGHES PITCHED,
BUT THE LOCAL
TEAM WON OUT
Two Games of the Series of
Three Taken by the
Frisco Nine.
Fast Ball Played in the Morining and
Afternoon â Yesterday's Honors
Were Divided Between
Both Sides.
?
San Francisco 4, Sacramento 2.
Perfect weather, a large crowd, stamp-
Ing 'and yelling with old-time baseball en
thusi&m and a spirited game of ball
made a success of yesterday's diamond
contest at Recreation Grounds. Some
fringy errors marred the excellence of the
game at times, but on the whole the
crowd was well pleased and used feet and
lungs to show its approval.
For two innings the work of both teams
was perfectâ of that fast order which
makes the heart of the fan palpitate and
grow warm. Both sides were retired in
one, two, three succession, Iburg and
Champion Hughes being supported with
a steadiness that was unbroken.
Hughes' first appearance in the box In
this city was not crowned with the laurels
of victory. Though touched for hits but a
half dozen times, four of them were
bunched In a. single Inning and four runs
resulted. Sponge this Inning out of the
game and the locals would nave reveled
in nothing but goose eggs. Iburg. pitched
good ball and received excellent support
at critical moments.
All through the game the crowd dis
played a keen Interest.
â¢ The first two innings brought nothing
in' the â¢ way of scores, but in the third
Frisco got on the baps and shoved four
men over the plate. Iburg opened up by
touching Champion Hughes for a double
and Brockhoff, next man with the stick,
repeated the performance, sending Iburg
over the rubber. Hughes was not so good
right here, McCarthy walking and Krug
getting first on a close In-field hit. Then
Hlldebrand flew to Shanahan, Brockhoff
scoring on the throw in. Reuben, the old,
perished on a foul fly, but Schwartz found
the spheroid, and while Egan was fool-
Ing with the ball in his attempt to put
the runner out at first, McCarthy and
Krug coursed the bags.
The sixth inning belonged to the sleepy
Senators. Devereaux swatted the ball so
fiercely that it rolled to the left field fence
and when Reuben returned it Devereaux
was on the third bag. Then "Truck"
Egan let his ctick go and the ball hit the
right field fence, Devereaux scoring and
Egan stopping at the midway point. On
Stanley's out Egan advanced a base,
scoring on Brockhoff's error, which placed
Hughes at first. This was all that hap
pened, but it put Sacramento on the score
board.
For a moment the ninth Inning looked
like something and the crowd held the
Beats in suspense. After one man had
found a place in the cemetery Shanahan
took a constitutional and second, when
Brockhoff stumbled over his own feet and
allowed Doyle to reach first unharmed.
That was as far as the Senators went,
Stultz doing a fly act to Peeples and Mc-
Laughlin doing the same to Krug.
The score: : /

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, MOKDAY, APRIL 16, 1900.
SEEN ALIVE BUT
RECORDED DEAD
AT THE MORGUE
Case of an Alleged Suicide
Reported Still in the
. Flesh.
Friends of Frank I*. T. Merwin Claim
That the Body at the Morgue
Was That of Another*
Man.
A singular mystery has developed In the
suicide of a man found dead in the lodg
ing-house at 317 Third street last Thurs
day and whose body was identified as
that of Frank L. T. Merwln. An inquest
brought â¢ out the fact that an unknown
man hired a room late Wednesday night
at the lodging-house and his dead body
was found the following morning. On the
shirt bosom of, the deceased was a fare
well message written In a facetious mood
and signed "Merwin." At the Morgue the
body was identified as that of Frank L. T.
Merwin and thÂ© name was duly recorded
on the Coroner's books. *
Now comes the story that on the day
following the publication of the story, the
man whose body was supposed to be lying
on a slab at the Morgue was met on the
street by a former friend, who spoke to
him and received the startling informa
tion that the notes were written by him
for the purpose of defrauding his credi
tors by an ingenious scheme of advertis
ing himself to the world as dead. Merwin
was much sought for yesterday, but if he
is alive he has succeeded so far in elud
ing the persons who are trying to clear up
the mystery.
John A. Ellert, a sign painter residing at
515 Eddy street, went to the Morgue
Thursday night and after viewing the
body of the suicide positively identified it
as that of Merwin. At the inquest held
two days later Mr. Ellert declared, after
seeing the body again, that he was mis
taken in his identification, and that he
was sure that the body was not that of
his former employe. v V. ' , Â» ,
Ellert gave as a reason for his mistake
that when he first saw the body it was
under the rays of the arc light in the
Morgue and that he gave it but a casual
glance. In thinking over the matter the
next day Mr. Ellert concluded that Mer
win was not as heavy in build as the sui
cide, and that the body did not bear a pe
culiar scar which was very noticeable on
Merwin's face. Ellert, in commenting on
the character of Merwin, said he was a
flippant sort of a fellow and always ready
with a "pert" answer.
A Mr. Millman of Oakland, who had
been a fellow worker with Merwin, read
the account of the suicide in Friday's
Call.
While on his way to the ferry Satur
day morning he says he was greatly sur
prised and astonished to see the supposed
dead man at work on Market street, near
Beale. He approached Merwin with a feel
ing of uncertainty and after satisfying
himself that he was not mistaken spoke
to him and asked for an explanation. Mill
man says Merwin was not pleased at the
recognition, but after a little parleying
said: "For God's sake, don't say any
thing about this and I will explain it all
to you Sunday. I wrote those notes to
beat my creditors."
Merwin, however, failed to appear and
make the prmised explanation. Millman
is unshaken in his identification and says
that nothing could make him believe that
he was not conversing with Merwin on
Saturday.
At the lodging-house where the suicide
occurred the landlady disclaimed all
knowledge of the case, except that a man
hired a room Wednesday night and was
found dead the next morning.
