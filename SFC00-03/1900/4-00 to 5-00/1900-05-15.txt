jf^XLL HEADQUARTERS, SACRAMENTO, May 14.
fk,^' â The streets and hotels of the town are busy to-night
with the bustle and excitement of politicians, big and lit
tle. The Republican State Convention, which will meet to
morrow, has called forth all the elements of the party. Repre
sentative men from all parts of the State are here, enthusiastic
and eager in advocacy of the sections and the candidates they
support. Political barnacles, old in sycophancy, time-worn in
years of pleading for favor, crowd the lobbies and make noisy
the corridors with their cheap chatter. For the honor of repre
senting the Republican party of California at the national con
vention manv are contending, and to-night a most remarkable
situation has presented itself. Two men are boasting that
through the power of a third man they own every man in the
Fourth Congressional District delegation and will vote every
delegate as they please.
One of these men, who is boasting that the delegates of
the Fourth Congressional delegation are his property, is a man
who is better known as a drunken loafer in the dives of the ten
derloin of San Francisco rather than as an adviser in the coun
cils of the National Republican party. His face is more familiar
in the habitations of social outcasts than in the company of men
who respect their decency and honor their character. His pres
ence is sought by the creatures who live in the shadows of a city
and thrive by the arts' thatnare possible" only in dark'iiess, not
by men who care to have the scrutiny of criticism upon their ac
tions.
This man is a growth of the evil of a big city. He is the
type and representative of the blackguard, yet to-night he is
boasting that four score men of reputation and integrity, men
of position and repute, men who would not dare recognize him
in the company of their associates, are his property, his play
things, to be handled as he pleases, as so much merchandise
which has been bought and sold.
The situation If a remarkable one. This
man keeps a saloon, and not even a repu
table Faloon. His skirts have been trailed
In the mire cf suspicious actions. He has
lived upon a reputation of evil power,
lie has trifled with school boards. Super
visors and official underlings and now
he boasts that out of the members of the
Fourth Congressional delegation at the
corning convention he will make his cat
tle, each delegate with a ring in his nose.
to be led wherever and whenever the rope
tightens.
This man's name is Phil Crimmins. Do
the delegates of the Fourth Congressional
District accept his boast without protest?
Are they willing to have their families,
thrir friends and their constituents b*>
ll*Â»ve that thry have sold their manhood
to a loader of the dive-? â to a creature
whose sphere began and ought to end in
the nameless places of the tenderloin of a
metropolis? Are these delegates, who
value their good names and prize the
esteem of their fellows, ready to admit
that they are the property of a man
whose horizon is limited to the rim of a
champagne glass and whose ideal is en
compassed In the short skirts of a di\-e
pongs tress?
Are thesp delegates ready to make good
with their votes and thelr-'bbedience the
boast of this man? Are they prepared to
sacrifice their Individuality and their self
respect at the command of a m?.n whom
they shun in public and tolerate on the
barest t--ufl>ranoe only In private?
It in the first time, perhaps, in the his
tory of the Republican party in Cali
fornia that the personification cf a tender
lola saloon of San Francisco played a part
in national politics.
dumber Two of the Triumvirate.
The KÂ«*conÂ«l man who is boasting here
to-r.ight that lie is thÂ«Â» proprietor of de
cent men. and that he owns a third In
terest In the delegation of the Fourth
Congressional district Is also a striking
eharactf-r. He is unique In one respect.
He Is the only man in California whose
character and reputation have been ap
praised by a jury fitting in a court of
justice. Ami that Jury, after due delib
eration and a critical estimate of every
redeerninPT feature, appraised this man's
character at one dollar. His name Is
ured in the hearing of reputable men only
by neceypity and never in the hearing of
decent' vrorher: yet to-night be pays he
owns an interest in the votes of four
score decent tmn and with his partners
vrtll barter these votes to suit his best
self -interest.
Hi* name ts Mnrtin Kelly. He was
never party to a p-.iitical contract that
crush. Do the delegates of the Fourth
Congressional District indorse his boast
that they are his property and that at
his bidding they are to be sold? Are they
ready to qay that his boast Is preliminary
to a contract Fuch as he has invariably
made in the politics of San Francisco?
As Republicans are they willing to make
him the standard of their political moral
ity and principles?
Third Member Is Herrin.
The third member of this precious tri
umvirate is a Democrat. With the au
dacity which has marked his career In
this Stato he has shamelessly arrogated
a right, as the servant of a great cor
poration, to prostitute public men of all
parties. He knows no morality, public or
private, except the interest of his em
ployers. He has scrupled at no act. how
ever discreditable, to advance the schem
ing ambitions of his employers. ' He has
lived in an atmosphere that stifles men
who value their names and the future of
those they cherish. His name has been
whispered in the scandals of municipal
and State officialism and now he says that
through the agency of a blackleg and a
blackguard he will vote every member of
the Fourth Congressional District at this
convention however, he pleases and how
ever bitter may be the humiliation of
those whom he votes. '
This man's name Is William F. Herrin.
He needs no further characterization. He
represents as in active agency all that is
vicious and unwholesome In public and
political life in California. He represents
a corporation which typifies; to Califor
nians the bribery of public officials, the
corruption of public Institutions, the pros
titution of public life; yet by the author
ity of one man, who reeks of the moral Â¦
slime of the dives, and of another who
may place his character on the auction
block for a dollnr. he stands ready to sell
the votes of four score men 'who would
not dare to admit of an association with
him.
Are the delegates of the Fourth Con
gressional District, men of repute, men
hoping for an honorable future in the
communities in which they live, ready to
seal with their votes this disgraceful com
pact of a saloonkeeper, a political huck
ster and a social huckster?
Shameless in Their Boasting-.
Perhaps the most remarkable phase of
this situation to-night is its indecency.
Crimmins and Kelly have not even con
sulted the men whose characters they are
trifling with and whom they Insolently
pretend to control. No effort has been
made to soften or disguise the shame of
the deal which this saloonkeeper and h's
Saloon Politicians Claim the
Ownership of a Powerful Dele
gation â Shameful Boast of
Kelly* Crimmins and Herrin*
Resentment Follows an Insolent
Assertion That the Fourth Dis

Resolutions Will Contain a Ringing
Indorsement of McKinley 's Ad

Issues*
Special Dispatch, to The Call
sfQA-LL HEADQUARTERS, SACRAMENTO, May 14.â
The Republican State convention, which will be called to
order at 2 p. m. to-morrow, consists of 591 delegates.
The number holding proxies will not exceed forty. The time for
filing contests expired at 1 p. m. to-day, and not one is on file.
It was settled this evening that Colonel Edward A. Forbes
of Marysville will be chosen chairman of the convention without
opposition from any source. He will be placed in nomination by
Colonel George Stone. The latter announced his withdrawal
this evening and generously acceded to the request to nominate
Colonel Forbes.
J. W. McKinley of Los Angeles is mentioned as the prob
able chairman of the committee on resolutions. -The sentiment
Expressed by delegates on the ground is against the adoption of
an elaborate platform- Rmgmg resolutions indorsing the ad
ministration of President McKinley will be adopted with en
thusiastic fervor. Many of the Republicans here recall the blun
der committed four years ago when the representatives of the
party in State convention went wild on silver at the ratio of 16
to- 1. A few weeks later the Republicans in national conven
tion proclaimed against the free and unlimited coinage of sil
ver and pronounced in favor of sound money. The Republicans
" of California accepted the national platform as the true princi
ple of the party, but the situation was awkward and embarrass
ing throughout thVcampaign of 1896. The delegates, in discuss
ing the platform to-night, gently express themselves against de
claring a national policy. Some things good for California and
known to be good for the whole country will be commended.
The contest fcr the honor of represent
ing California in the national convention
Is interesting. The candidates in the field
for delegates at large are U. S. Grant Jr.
of San Diego, John D. Spreckels and
George A. Knight of San Francisco. Dr.
George C. Pardee of Oakland and N. D.
Rideout of Marjsville.
Probable District Delegates.
Considerable interest is manifested in
the selection of delegates to represent the
several Congressional districts. It is the j
talk to-night that the First District will j
elect John L. Child of Del None and
Douglas S. Cone of Red Bluff.
In the Second District E. C. Hart of
Sacramento and John L. Kldder of Ne
vada County are slated. When the dis
trict convention meets to-morrow Harold
Power of Placer may develop strength
sufficient to displace Mr. Kldder.
The Third District will send G. W. Reed
of Oakland. The Alameda delegation has
agreed to keep hands off and permit the j
other counties of the district to adjust j
affairs connected with the choice- of the
second delegate. Ttie Contra Costa and
Sclano delegations favor the election ot
R. D. Robblns, banker of Sulsun.
The Fourth District convention will
doubtless elect Joseph S. Spear Jr. and
M. A. Gunst.
The Fifth District delegates have agreed
to send W. C. Van Fleet and H. G. Bond
of Santa Clara, banker and president of
the Fruit Growers' Exchange.
In the Sixth District affairs are unset
tled. It was- supposed early this evening
that J. W. McKlnley of Los Angeles artd
A. J. Bell, a Grand Army veteran of Ven
tura, would be chosen without opposition.
Later Mr. McKlnley decided to withdraw
in favor of William M. Garland of Loa
Angeles. Ine further news develops that
J. W. Taggart of Santa Barbara will en
ter the field against A. J. Bell.
The Seventh District, according to pres
ent indications, will select Dr. Chester
Rowell of Fresno and W. S. Hooper of
San Bernardino.
Warren M. John of San Luis Obispo ,s
mentioned as a candidate for alternate
delegate In the Sixth Congressional Dis
trict. He arrived In Sacramento to-night.
District conventions will meet to-mor
row as follows: First District. Senate
chamber. 11 a. m.; Second District. Pa
vilion. 11 a. m.; Third District, Assembly
chamber, noon; Fourth District. Pavilion.
1:30 p. m.; Fifth' District. Pavilion. 1 p.
m.; Sixth District, after recess of con
vention: Seventh District, Pavilion, 10
a. m.
When Colonel George Stone announced
his intention of withdrawing from the con
test for the chairmanship of the conven
tion in favor of Colonel Forbes he sig
nified a desire for reappointment on th-j
executive committee. The Importance of
this committee will be appreciated when
It Is understood that it will have in its
control the management of the campaign
in California.
In the absence of the chairman Dr.
George C. Pardee. first vice chairman,
will call the convention to order at 2
o'clock p. m. Frank D. Ryan of Sacra
mento will perform the duties of secre
tary.

Lord Roberts replied April 22 that he
w.is glad to receive President Kruger's
assurances, and pointed out that no dif
ference was made by the British authori
ties in regard to the Boer prisoners
against whom there might be reasonable
ground for suspicion that they would try
to escape, adding that such exceptions
gave room for abuse by officials without
the knowledge of the authorities.
Regarding enteric fever, the Government
of the Transvaal said it was prevalent
among the civil population as well as
r.mong the prisoners, and every remedial
measure had been taken.
ar.d President Kruger relative to the al
leged ill treatment of colonial prisoners.
The Transvaal's reply was to the effect
that there was no difference in the treat
ment of the prisoners, and that only a
few who had controverted martial law or
who had tried to escape, or who it had
been suspected might try to escape, had
been placed in jail for security. Otherwise
they had been treated like the other pris
oners of war. '

brought the first Intimation of a success
attained by General Duller in Northern

."General Buller's official telegram tell

LONDON. May 14.â At the annual meet-
Ing of the Army Temperance Association
to-day Major General Sir George White,
the defender of Ladysmlth. presiding, a
letter was read from Lord Roberts, dated
Bloemfontein, April 19, during the course
of which the writer says: "There never
was a more temperate army than that
which marched under my command from
the Modder river to Bloemfontein. Noth
ing but- good can result from so many
soldiers being brought together in an ar
duous campaign when' they see how splen

have had to face."

It appears that on Thursday last Paul

AFRIKANDER WOMEN
ASK TO BE ARMED
CUBANS GRIN OVER
AMERICAN DISHONESTY
WASHINGTON, May 14.â The Postmas
ter General, after a protracted interview
with the President to-day, announced
that Joseph L. Bristow, Fourth Assist
ant Postmaster General, will proceed to
Havana next Wednesday to take charge
of the postal affairs of the island of Cuba.
The Postmaster General declined to say
whether or not Director General of Posts
Rathbone would be suspended. It Is said,
however, that the fact that General Bris
tow will assume these duties does not nec
essarily indicate that Mr. Rathbone will
be relieved of all connection with the ser
vice. General Bristow outranks the Di
rector of Posts, and the latter might ope
rate as a subordinate, though on this
point no statement is vouchsafed.
Further than the announcement that
Mr. Bristow would go to Havana, the
Postmaster General said there were no
new developments in the situation. He
said that there had not been an Intima
tion that there had been any wrongdoing
in the postal affairs of either the Philip
pine Islands or Porto Rico. |
Respecting rumors that similar irregu
larities to those developed in Cuba have
occurred in the other insular possessions
over which military jurisdiction has been
extended, It is declared positively at the
War Department that while the inspec
tors have been working constantly to im
prove the administrative service, they
have not found a single case Involving
moral turpitude.
"To my surprise," said Lindsay to a re
porter, "the charges in Governor Wood's
requisition papers go back to .the old
Spanish laws; they accuse our client of a
violation of the penal code of Cuba, arti
cle 401, section 3, which reads: 'Any pub
lic employe who has charge of public
funds who takes, or consents that others
will take any part thereof, shall be pun
ished with the penalty of Presidio Mayor,
if the sum taken exceeds 6250 pesetas and
does not exceed 125.000 pesetas.' Under
this charge, if convicted, he may be im
prisoned in quarters where the crime* was
committed for a term not exceeding
twelve years or less than six and a day."
"The charges are not brought under the
United States laws, the maximum penalty
for the same offense being seven -years,
nor under the postal laws of Cuba, which
provide for a penalty of not less than six
months nor more than ten years. As the
charges read, the authorities want to try
him In Cuba without a jury and before a
Judge appointed by the Military Gover
nor. Our client asks to be tried in the
United States court as a citizen."
After reading the papers which came
by messenger from Washington, John D.
Lindsay, counsel for Neeley, informed
District Attorney Barnett that he would
oppose the granting of extradition papers.
"I have received the requisition papers
from Washington and have communicat
ed with Governor Roosevelt in regard to
the hearing which is always allowed the
defendants In extradition cases. I pre
sume the hearing will be g}ven not later
than Wednesday."
NEW YORK, May 14.â In speaking of
the requisition for the extradition of
Charles F. W. Neeley. the chief of the
finance division of the Postofflce Depart
ment of Cuba, who is charged with em

others throughout the island, and also to
have extended to outside points which
have been used for the sale of some of
the old Issue of stamps that were ordered
destroyed. â¢
The result of the Investigation at the
local postofflce Is the suspension of Post
master Thompson, who was Installed in
April. of last year. He will remain at his
own house for the present. Moya and
Mascaro, stamp-sellers In the main office,
have also been arrested and further ar
rests are expected to-morrow. As many
as six others have been placed under the
closest supervision and will be arrested
as soon as their services can be spared.
As a matter of fact, if they were all
to be suddenly relieved of duty it would
not be possible to carry on the postal de
partment of Havana.
Messrs. Reeves and Reynolds, the audi
tors: of the postal department, are still
under arrest at their own : rooms.' in
charge, of detectives. ~ Special quarters
will, however, be prepared In some for
tress, where all , the prisoners connected
with the frauds will be taken as soon as
arrested. â¢ /Â¦'Â¦'
â¢ To-day's arrests and the suspension of
Mr. ' Thompson did not take place until
after dark, and consequently these new
features of- the case, are not generally
known - throughout the city this evening,
but there is a perceptible excitement at
the postofflce, where no one knows who
may be the next to be singled out.
It appears that the frauds .ramified in
almost every, possible direction. Even the
rented boxes have been a source of ille
gitimate gain. ; Â¦ Â¦
Every, additional - revelation Increases
the amazement of ' the Americans here
The Cubans seem to be Immensely pleas

no longer boast in Cuba' of their superior
honesty, when in Government employ.

HAVANA. May 14.â The. extent of the
postal frauds is far greater than what
was originally expected. Besides taking

sion of the scandal made public by the
arrest of Neeley. There is some dis
position in certain quarters to transfer to
the shoulders of General Alger all the re
sponsibility possible. He is blamed first
for the appointment of Director Rathbone
and of the postal auditor, and secondly
because he ignored General Breckinridge's
tlrst cabled recommendation permitting
the auditor to continue a long inspection
of the postal accounts. General Breckin
ridge, relative to the statements published
this morning:, telegraphed Secretary Root,
arserting he was not responsible for the
criticisms and intimating that the respon
sibility rested with Mr. Root's predeces
sor. It is pointed out by army officers,
however, that Mr. Root was Secretary of
War when General. Breckinridge submit
ted his annual report, in which special
stress was laid upon the advisability of
having the inspectors general inspect all

Chamberlain Introduces New Austra
lian Commonwealth Bill and
Explains the Purposes of
tha Government.
LONDON, May 14.â The Secretary of
State for the Colonies. Mr. Joseph Cham
berlain, rose in a well filled house to-day
to introduce :the Australian Common
wealth bill, which he. described as a great
and important step towards the organiza
tion of the British 'empire.
Continuing, Mr. Chamberlain said it
would make Australia an indissoluble
federal commonwealth, united for the
most important functions of government
with intercolonial free trade, a common
tariff for. all. the colony and common con
trol of the national defense. Mr. Cham
berlain pointed. out that as foreign coun
tries were concerned in the new consti
tution it was important that measures
that might involve the imperial govern
ment in the most serious responsibilities
should be interpreted by a tribunal in
which all the % parties had full confidence,
and the government could not consent to
Clause 74 relating to the Appeal Court,
because it meant the abolition of the im
perial veto. The government would ask
the /house, he said, to amend the bill so
as to retain the power of the Court of Ap
peals. The government, he added, pro
posed to introduce In the House of Lords
forthwith a reheme to appoint for seven
years a representativo each of Canada,
South Africa, Australia and India to be
members of the privy council and who
would act as Lords of appeal. Life peer
ages would be conferred on them so that
they would continue to sit in the House
of Lords, although they would not act as
Judges after their term of service had
expired. They would be paid the same a3
I^ords of Appeal and at the cost of the
imperial government.
The Liberal leader in the House, Sir
Henry Campbell-Eannerman, said he
thought it unfortunate that the govern
ment had not acceded to proposals which
had received the unanimous approval of
Australia and. he added, the opposition
would refuse to support the government
proposals in reference to the Court of Ap
peals.
The bill passed its first, reading. The
second reading: was fixed for May 21.

ROUSED TO ACTION BY
SECRETARY ROOrS WORDS
A Call correspondent called at Miss
MorriU's home this evening to get her
version of the affair. Owing to her pros
trated condition she was unable to see
him. but her brother-in-law. County Audi
tor B. A. Hayden, spoke for her. Mr.
Hayden confirmed Miss Morrell's signed
statement which appeared in an Oakland
paper this afternoon. She had known Mr.
Vroom for the past two years. She first
met him two years ago when both were
engaged for the season with Mine. Mo
jecka. Last season she knew him with
the Vroom-Addison Company, of which
she was a member. Mr. Vroom was kind
and gentlemanly in his bearftig toward
her and naturally a warm friendship
sprang up between them. In consequence
of this friendship Mr. Vroom occasionally
called on Miss Morrell when she was In
San Francisco and on several occasions
he called while the actress' sisters were
visiting her from Bakerslield and Oak
land. These ladies were pleasantly im
pressed with Mr. Vroom and felt grateful
toward him for the kind Interest dis
played by him In behalf of their sister
and he was of much assistance to her
in her stage aspirations. Miss Morrell
knew but little about Mrs. Vroom not
withstanding the fact that she was out
BAKERSFIELD, May 14.â Miss Mor
rell. the pretty little actress. Is
prostrated over the publicity given
her connection with the shooting of
Actor Vroom and her family and
wide circle of friends here are profoundly
shocked at the humiliating role the es
teemed and popular young lady has been
forced to play in the affair. It is not"
strange that they should be when Miss
Morrell's pure and spotless life here,
where she was born and raised, is con
sidered. In fact the whole community
feels outraged at the Incident. Xo young
lady was ever more popular and highly
esteemed in any community than Miss
Morrell. All her relatives are prominent
and influential. All believe the young
lady's story that no Illicit relations what
ever existed between her and Actor
Vroom.
Â£l*clal Dispatch to Th* Call.
Some of the time one of my sisters was

I have known Mr. Vroom for two years, he
havlnr been a member of the Modjeska com
pany at the same time as myself.

Durlnc the past two months I boarded In
San Francisco at 927 Geary street.
with the lady for a season. She learned
In the beginning that Mrs. Vroom pos
sessed a disagreeable disposition and
hence shunned her. Miss Morrell disliked
to speak about Mrs. Vroom. She does not
want any controversy with her.
The first thing Miss Morrell knew of the
presence of Mrs. Vroom the morning of
the memorable meeting was when the en
raged woman broke into her room on
Geary street while she was yet in bed.
Mrs. Vroom leaped upon her like a tigress
and seized her by the throat and accused
her of illicit relations with her husband.
Mrs. Vroom also flourished a pistol and
a written document purporting to embody
Miss Morrell's confession of her relations
with Vroom. The young lady was natu
rally thrown Into great fear when com
manded to sign the document at the point
of a pistol in the hand of the frantic
woman. She signed the paper as she
thought to save her life, knowing that not
a line of it was true.
Bernard Jackson, who resides here ana
who also traveled with the Vroom-Addi
pon Company last year, speaks in the
highest terms of Miss Morrell. He pro
nounces her one of the purest women on
the stage. He does not have a good word
for Mrs. Vroom. He says she Is insanely
jealous and was the cause of many a
"scene" that the public never gazed on
during the season. He describes . her as
a tempestuous fuss maker, who fre
quently made matters warm for Vroom.
He speaks well of Vroom.
Shortly after Mrs. Vroom visited Miss
Morrell's room the young lady went to
her sister's in Oakland and from there
came to her home In Bakersfleld. Owing
to her great modesty she never said any
thing about the matter till the papers got
hold of it, and in consequence of thp
ridiculous misstaternents which appeared
in some of the papers her people thought
best to give out the young lady'a state
ment. Otherwise she preferred to avoid
any further publicity.
The following statement has been Issued
by Miss Morrell:
The Charge of Assault to Murder
Against Her Will Probably
Be Dismissed.
Grace Addlson Vroom, the ietress. who
fired two shots at her husband, Frederick
Vroom, the actor, last Tuesday In hla of
fice at 10 Annie street because of his in
lldellty, was punctually on time in Judge
Cabaniss' court yesterday morning. She
entered the courtroom leaning on the arm
of Detective Dillon. When her case,
charging her with assault to murder, was
called she tried to shield her face from
the gaze of the spectators in court, and
listened calmly to the Judge as he in
structed her as to her rights. She was
not represented by counsel, but the Judge
continued the case till to-morrow, when it
will likely be dismissed, as Vroom is in
Seattle and will not be here to prosecute
Before entering the courtroom she deliv
ered to Detective Dillon the revolver with
which she fired the shots. It was a cheap
32-caliber weapon, hammerless and small
and so difficult to operate that she could
hardly pull the trigger. She is still suf
fering from nervousness Rnd seems to
care little what becomes of her.
engagement with one of the Btook companies.
Mr. Vroom called upon me and save me
his advice and assistance.
He rnet my sisters and brother-in-law and
enjoyed their respect and esteem.
I had not seon Mrs. Vroom until she came to
my room one morning, and utterly to my sur
prise, commenced to abuse and choke me.
She had a pistol and threatened to kill me.
With the pistol at my head and under threat
to kill me she compelled me to Btgn two or
three papers, the import of which was vile
and not justified by any relations existing be
tween Mr. Vroom and myself.
After her attack I left my room and went to
my sister's in Oakland, and later came to
Hakersfleld.
All the reports In San Francisco pasers are
based upon Mrs. Vroom' s statements.
In so far as they state that Mr. Vroom
and mvself were more than friends they are
utterly false.
I believe that Mm. Vroom is insane.
I can offer no other explanation of her ac
tions.

A bill was passed to authorize the Se

in the Indian Territory.
At 5:0S p. m. the House adjourned.
VASHIXGTOX, May Itâ The House to
day passed the general deficiency appro
priation bill, and the military academy
t.il, the last of . the supply bills, â¢will
follow It to-morrow. The deficiency bill
carried J3,Â£3?,CC1 and was passed substan
tially without amendment. The general
debate was devoted practically to political
teller, the feature being a severe arraign
ment of the administration by De Armond
of Missouri.
Little of the general debate was perti
nent to the bill. Bropius of Pennsylvania
made a statement of the progressive op
eration of the financial law, supplement
ary of a statement made by him a few
tiu'ys ago. It showed that the total amount
oi bones refunded to May 10 was $2GS,44l,
ftJQ, a little over 20 per cent of the bonds
having beon presented by other than na
tionaJ banks. The national bank circula
tion Fince the passage of the financial bill
he- said had increased $36,152.OS1.
Corliss of Michigan read a letter from
a native Porto Rican indorsing the action
of Congress in passing the Porto Rican
tariff law.
Green of Pennsylvania urged higher tax
ation of olt-omargrarine.
De Armond of Missouri ridiculed the let
ter read by Corliss. He described the ec
stacy with which the native population
must have received the views that they
Â¦were to be governed by "carpet-baggers,"
â¢who. he said, "would take everything
portable and null down everything they
could not carry away." It would be the
ead and fhameful etory of carpet bagism
in the South again.
De Armond charged the administration
â¢with cowardice for allowing no official
utterance in sympathy to go out to the
Boera struppling in South Africa to re
peat the splendid story <jf the American
revolution. He concluded by charging
that there was either a secret under
standing with Great Britain or an Ameri
can administration, truckling: to wealth
and power, tool overlooked and forgotten
the rights of humanity.
Underwood of Alabama offered on
amendment to allow all the employes^T
the House one month's extra pay. To it

sustained by the chair and then by the
House on appeal. Practically without
amendment ihe bill was passed.

PREPARING FOR REGATTA
AT BEAUTIFUL BELVEDERE
A Btar witness and a star document in
favor of the proponents in the Cravtfn-
Falr litigation gave the case a new im
petus yesterday. For a ,week the case
dragged slowly along that handwriting
experts might impress their theories on
the mind of the court. N.ow they have
done, or almost so, and the future pro
ceedings of this Important case now
threaten to" partake of the mildly sensa
tional.
If. N. Bryant's statement that he bor
rowed $50 from James G. Fair In June,
1S92, that Miss June Payne might enjoy
a contemplated trip to Salt Lake City,
was flatly denied from the witness stand
by the lady In question In Judge Troutfs'
court yesterday.
In answer to the question of the clerk
when she was sworn she said her name
was Mrs. N. J. Horton. She said that
after leaving this city she married the
man whose name she now bears, but, not
withstanding this fact, she was none other
than the June Payne referred to by Mr.
Bryant and had come to the city for the
sole purpose of contradicting bis state
ment.
Mrs. Horton testified that she came to
San Francisco in 1892 in response to a let
ter from H. N. Bryant, who informed her
that she could secure employment here *s
a typewriter. On arriving in this city she
took apartments at the Golden West
Hotel, where she remained for a week.
After leaving the hotel she went to Oak
land for a six weeks' stay. As affairs did
not prosper she decided to return to Salt
Lake, which she did in April, two days
after the earthquake which occurred In
that month. ....
Mrs. Horton's testimony Is considered
very important, as it directly impeaches
Bryant, â¢ who was one of -Mrs. Craven's
Btar witnesses. Bryant testified that he
met Mrs. Craven In Senator Fair's office
In either May. or June, 1892, at which time
Fair introduced the school teacher as his
wife. ... - Â¦ i
"I went <to Senator Fair's : Bry
ant testified, "to borrow $50 with which
to pay *he railroad- fare of.. Miss June
Payne from this city to Salt Lake. Fair
handed me the money, and as I was leav
ing Mrs. Craven Came in. 'This is my
wife,' said Senator Fair. 'She has come
to my office to see me at work.' "
On cross-examination Bryant would not
swerve from his statement that the meet
ing occurred in June and yesterday Mr3.
Horton was called to. disprove his asser
tion. She testified that she left this city,
on April 22, 1892. She went ' to Salt Lake
Cityand resided there several years. She
finally married W. J. Horton and now
lives with him In Los Angeles, where he
conducts a livery stable. She was posi
tive she left San Francisco on April 22.'
"Did Bryant, provide- you with transpor
tation?" was asked.
VHe did not. He never gave me any
money except that. which was due me for
my services as stenographer," answered
the witness. â¢ Â¦ : .
"To your knowledge, did he borrow $50
from Senator Fair?"
"He had no authorization from me to do
so, and If he did he told me nothing about
it.". . .â¢- â¢ Â¦.:â¢ .... â¢ : Â¦
"Did he ever mention to you anything
about his having been, introduced to^Mrs:
Craven by Senator Fair. and did he men
tion anything about the Senator having
referred to Mrs. Craven as his wife?" ,
"He did not," was the final' answer of
the witness on direct examination. ' ..
On cross-examination Mrs. Horton said
she came to this city to testify in the case
at the request of the executors of the Fair
will,, who located her a week ago.: Not
withstanding-the. attempt. of Lafe Pence
to break her down, she did not ; waver
but adhered to her story and the. dates
given throughout. . , ": Â¦ Â¦* .%â¢

FAIR INDULGED
IN PASTIME OF
WRITING WILLS
The book Js filled with memoranda of
similar nature and prove, as the attor
neys contend, that Mrs. Craven-Fair and
also her daughter were aware of the ne
cessity of complete notes on passing
events. One of the most startling notes;
which has heretofore been kept out of the
case, purports to be a copy of one writ
ten by Senator Fair. It reads:
"I wish Nettle It. Craven burled in my
vault. James G. Â¦ Fair." .Following this
note Is a comment, evidently made by
Mrs. Koehler. "Used to call on mother
quite often," the note reads, "but I do not
remember the dates. It was a habit of
his to make wills at our house and to con
sult with mother on Investments or busi
ness changes." Another .note, evidently
made by Mrs. Craven, reads: "Last will
made September U, 1S94. Wrote Birdie
soon after that he had made another will
and that I was provided for outside of the
will." -.- V Â¦ ::Â¦
After. the memorandum book was duly
Introduced In John J. Fleming
certified to the correctness of a diagram
of the Lick House by which the defense
will-attempt to prove that 'Â¦ Senator Fair
could not have visited Mrs. Craven- Fair
at the hotel wlttiout being seen and caus
ing comment.
Mrs. Craven-Fair was recalled to answer
a question of minor Importance, as were
Estelle .Houghton, Robert A. Coulter and
Charlotte Clarke. An adjournment was
then taken until this morning. " ':
Attorney Garret \V. McEnerney, <jn be
half of the proponents, next offered in
evidence one -jf Mrs. Craven-Fair's mem
orandum bookÂ«, "Just," he said, "to prove
that some people must be either gifted
with long memories or take copious
notes." In this book appears the hand
writing of both Mrs. Craven-Fair and her
daughter, Mrs. Margaret Koehler.
Some of the most InterostliiK notations
read: 'Will made September 24, 1S94.
Mother never told me time as to hers.".
"March .5. night of -party at. 2002 Pine
streetâ 1S91." "March 2. .1891. he wrote let
ter to mamma." "March lt5,lS91. made will
at 2002 Pineâ eveningâ I Rive to my chil
dren all of which I die possessed." "Date
of contract of maâ May 23. 1S92. Was living
nt B23 Sutter street." "S. F. was at Grand
Opera-house tColumbus) May 24, 1S92."
"May 21, 1S92, made will which was stolen
from Cal Hotel."
'Is It not a fact," said Pence, "that at
that .time Senator -Fair charged you with
having conspired - with . Mr. Palmer, the
m .?t1- ae Â£r. '.' f nls ranch - to defraud him?"
He did, answered thu witness. "There
.was -'ah' article published and I went Â»o
Senator Fair and demanded a retraction.
He refused to make one and I resigned
forthwith."
"Did you not blame Mrs. Craven for
your trouble at "that time?"
"I never thought of such a thing."
"You knew that Senator Fair and Mrs.
Craven were intimate, did you not?"
"I can't say that I did; in fact I did not
know the nature of their relationship."
Theodore Kytka was next called and
identified negatives of the notarial attes
tations appended to the pencil deeds. By
means of these negatives, backed up by
the opinion of various witnesses, the at
torneys for the heirs and executors seek
to establish their contention that the
forms Notary Cooney says he used when
the deeds in question were acknowledged
before him were not printed until long,
after Senator Fair's death.
"When handed over for cross-examina
tion the witness was called upon by Lafe
Pence to assist In locating the much
coveted diary kept by Senator Fair in
18&2. Neal said that he knew nothing of
the existence of such a diary, but he
knew that "Pair was a great hand at
taking notes." Further questioning only
served to xk>velop his opinion. He said
that he believed the pencil will to be the
handiwork of Mrs. Craven.
Wltnesp said that he had no grievance
against Mrs. Craven, but admitted that he
nad some trouble with Senator Fair in
X059.
Senator Fair never wrote the document,
but. at that time they held a different
opinion, j I also believe the opera-house
note and the marriage contract to be for
geries."
FOR the fourth consecutive year San
ta Clara Colleg-o has won the inter
collegiate baseball championship,
defeating Stanford and Berkeley.
This year's team, while, not as strong as
those of former years, is entitled to cred
it, as there was never a season begun un
der less auspicious circumstances. So
many of the old pluyers had left college
that it was considered doubtful If a good
team could be put In the field in such
short time. This difficult task was en
trusted to "Billy" Hulen of National
League fame. Mr. Hulen set to work with
a will, but at the end of two weeks had
to sever his connection with the team as
coach. The rest of the season was played
with- no coach :to direct affairs, Â¦ which
makes the work of the team all the' more
creditable.
The season of 1900 was a very short one.
Only twelve games were playedâ seven
with the big universities. Stanford and
Berkeley, and live with crack amateur
teams of the State, such as the Koenigs,
Altog and" San Jose teams.
Of the seven played with Stanford and
Berkeley four were victories and three
defeats, while of the other games played
all were victories, making for the season
of 1900 a record of nine victories and
three defeats. Summing up the record of
the Santa Clara College team for. the last
three years It Is founn to be a wonderful
one. In 1808 the greatest team that ever
sported the red and white colors of Santa
Clara played twenty games without a sin
gle defeat. In 1899 the record was sixteen
victories and three defeats, and in 1900
nine victories and three defeats, making
a total of forty-five victories and six de
.L s 'r, Tne record for the games played
with Stanford and Berkeley during the
same time has. been: Victories over Stan
ford 9. defeats 3; victories over Berke
ley 8. defeats 1; making a total of 17 vic
tories and 4 defeats. Much of the success
or the team of 1900 was due to the cap
taincy of Charles Graham and the effi
cient management of Thomas J. Nihill.

When the news of the recent British vic
tories reached the' coast Cape Town .and
Durban were a mass of stars and stripes.
These flags were displayed by English
men, not Americans. Lady Randolph
Churchill waved, according 10 the Natal
newspapers, from the hotel balcony a
union jack in one hand and Old Glory in
the other.
'1 he engine which pulled Cronje'6 cap
tured troops packed standing in open
cattle cars, through the suburbs of Cape
Town, was decorated with American and
British flags. Nearly every train which
hauls troops or supplies to the front has
one or more Stars and Stripes displayed.
Secretary of State Reitz, who is rapidly
breaking down under the strain he is un
dergoing, voiced this general hope in
these words: "We will maintain our in
dependence if we can. If we cannot we
will appeal to 'the American people to
lake us under their wing. Surely the
Declaration of Independence is broad
enough to span the ocean. Our last hope
is that, having again and again carried
our burden of persecution, into the wilder
ness to escape from England, we may ba
permitted to deposit it at the foot of the
statue of Liberty, to find peace and pro
tection under the Stars and Stripes.

PRETORIA. March 25.â A commission
composed of Messrs. Fischer. Wessels and
Wolmarans and- representing the republics
of the Transvaal and Orange Free State
sailed for Europe some ten days ago. I
have the highest authority for making the
statement that rather than see their coun
try' conquered by England the Commis
sioners are empowered to ask the United
States to assume a protectorate over the
republics, this protectorate to tend, if de
sired, toward eventual annexation as Ter
ritories or States. In their growing desire
cf getting justice, and seeing no prospect
of getting it at England's hands,- the
Boers turn their eyes toward America.
They do this notwithstanding the use to
which the English in Natal and Cape Col
ony in their faith In America's friendship
are putting "Old Glory."

CHICAGO, May 14.â According to Infor
mation recelvc-d from the Democratic Na
tional Committee here to-day Hawaii and
Porto Rico will send delegates to the Oem
ocratic National Convention. Each island
will be accorded six delegates if the
wishes of the leaders of the Democratic
party are carried out.
It is the intention to place Hawaii and
Porto Rico In the class with the District
of Columbia. Alaska and Indian Terri

tion that Hawaii and Porto Rico are Ter

Senator J. K. Jones, chairman of the
national committee, recently received a
letter from some Sandwich Islanders who
said they wore Democrats, asking him if
the convent: an wouid seat the Hawaiian

City on July 4. Sen tor Jones replied that
the convention Itself would have to pass
upon that question, but. It is said, he
advised the Hawaiians to Fend their dele
gation, which might be seated.
. The Democratic managers say there is
pood politics in the idea of giving promi
nent seats in the convention to the Porto
Rican delegation. The Democrats belle\*e

Organized la.bor is also on Edwards'
side. He has been a large employer, and'
the unions have practically all indorsed
him. Furthermore, the Martin adminis
tration this morning refused to pass a
re-solution presented by San Jose Typo
graphical I. nion by whjeh it was asked to
Fee that the union label is on all city
work. The Supervisors last week ordered
the union label on all county work. This
same matter came up before the Coun
cil to-day.
The city official paper, the Evening
Herald, is a non-union office, and the
Council sent the resolution into the Ordi
nance Committee. Here the matter will
rest until after election. The city print
ing contract expires this month, and the
printers regard this action of the Coun
cil as opposing them, and it will probably
drive votes from Martin.

be held at Kansas City on July. 4.. It will
be one of the largest conventions in the
history of the State, the call providing
for 464 delegates. King County, which is
entitled to the greatest number of dele
gatesâ53âwill be here with contesting
delegates, and the settlement of which
will be seated promises to be the event of
the gathering. Among the delegates-elect
are many formerly known as Populists
and Silver Republicans, as the convention
call invited all who will vote for Bryan
to take part.

Had this sentiment prevailed it would
have meant that Jonn L. Bittinger, Con
sul General to Montreal, and Major "Wil

candidates for delegates at large to Phil

drop out of the race.
The convention will nominate a full

over the State offices, with Joseph Flory

discord incident to the convention. Dur

developed. To avoid a row a recess was

Baseball, Football and Tug
of-War Tournament
Soon to- End. *
How the Teams Stand Now â May
Lead to the Formation of Ath
' le tic Clubs in the Vari
ous Schools.
The boys of eleven grammar and four
high schools are absorbed Just now in the
baseball, football and tug-of-war tourna
ment , that was inaugurated a fortnight
ago by Principal Bush of tha Polytechnic
High School for their amusement and in
struction and which will be brought to a
close next Tuesday afternoon. Four beau
tiful trophies are being competed for and
the enthusiasm with which the boys have
entered the contest has been a revelation
to teachers and parents alike.
Principal Bush believes in athletics in
the grammar schools. While the present
tournament was only a chance affairâ a
sort of Â¦overflow from .the Mayday festi
vities â now that It is fairly under way Mr.
Bush thinks' he can easily demonstrate
that it is an excellent thing for growing
boys. The defeats of the University of
California athletes in the East during the
past few weeks have been ascribed by com
petent critles to the fact that the Eastern
college athletes are men who commenced
their athletic training under competent
teachers while they were boys in grammar
schools, whereas the California boys had
only taken up the work after they en
tered college. It Is the desire of Mr. Bu3h
that out of this will grow up a system of
athletic clubs in the grammar schools, un
der proper instructorsâ that. -will be very
beneficial to the boys. This tournament
has also demonstrated the necessity of
proper playgrounds in connection with the
schools. For their game the boys have
been compelled heretofore to go to places
outside of town or to private parks.
Ten baseball teams have taken part in
the tournament 'and seven games a. day
have been played on the average. The
standing of the clubs at the present time
is as follows:

made the following statement in explana
tion of the provisions of the law:
The tax on legacies and distributive shared
Included In the war revenue act of 1S38 is
graded In two ways, according to the degree
of kinship of the legatee and according: to the
valuÂ« of the legacy. The Initial rate Is deter
mined by the defrree of kinship. A legacy to
a husband or wife Is exempt. L.?gacles to
others must pay a tax which rises a* tbe de
gree of kinship is more remote, until property
passing to strangers In blood rays 5 per rent.
To this initial rate a progressive rate, accord
ing to the value of the legacy panning, is ap
plied. Property valued at $10,000 and under Is
exempt; exceeding I10.C0O. but not exceeding
J2.1.CW. the rate is fixed by kinship. The rate
rises with the amount until property exceeding
$1,000,000 Is required to pay the rate fixed by
kinship multiplied by three. .*â¢..â¢

SAN PEDRO CONTRACT.
WASHINGTON, May 14.â After a dis
cussion lasting five full days the Senate
to-day passed the naval appropriation bill.
Practically four days were devoted to the
consideration of the armor plate proposi
tion, which was agreed to finally as re
ported by the committee with the excep
tion' that the Secretary of the Navy is
authorized to make contracts only for
such armor as may be needed from time
to time. The Secretary of the Navy is
authorized to procure armor of the best
quality at $445 per ton, but If he be unable
to obtain, it at that price he Is then
authorized to pay $545 per ton for the
armor for the battleships Maine. Ohio and
Missouri, and proceed to erect an armor
factory, to cost not to exceed $4,000,000.
one-half of which amount is made Im
mediately available. The committee's
proposition carried by a vote of 32 to 19.
The Secretary of the Navy Is directed
to purchase five Holland torpedo-boats at
a price not exceeding $170,000 each.
Just before adjournment Nelson of Min
nesota called up the "free homes" bill,
and it was passed without a word of de
bate.'Representative Flynn of Oklahoma.
who has been a warm champion of the
measure, was present when the bill passed
and cordially congratulated Senator Nel
son. . . â¢
A concurrent resolution was adopted
directing the Secretary of War to appoint
a board of officers of the engineer, corps
to prepare plans for the improvement of
the Snake River, in Washington and
Idaho.
A bill for the establishment of, a light
house and fog signal at Slip Point, Wash.',
at a cost of J12.000, was passed.
A concurrent resolution was adopted for
a survey of the outlet of'Flathead Lake,
Montana, with a view to keeping the lake
full.
A bill providing for the appointment or
a Collector of Customs for the customs
district of Hawaii, at a salary of $400) per
year, and auch deputies as may be neces
sary, was passed.
Hale then called up the naval appro
priation bill, the pending question being
on the amendment of Chandler substi
tuting in Tillman's amendment $425 for
$300 as the price of armor. The amend
ment was rejected, 25 to 27.
Hoar offered the following amendment
to thÂ« committee's proposition with re
spect to the construction of an armor
plate factory: "That If under the opera
tion of the above provision no Govern
ment armor plate manufactory Is begun or
built the Secretary of the Navy shall sub
mit to Congress at the beginning of Its
next session a detailed report, in which
he shall estimate the entire cost of a fully
equipped Government armor plate manu
factory. Including site, and the probable
time at which the best modern armor
plate could be produced at said factory
and ready for delivery."
The nmendment was accepted by the
committee and as amended the commit
tee's proposition was adoptedâ 32 to 19. as

The next proposition of the committee
nrovlded for the purchase of five Holland
submarine torpedo-boats at a price ot
$170 000. and It was adopted after Bome de
bate with an amendment making the pur
chase mandatory. During this -, debate
Teller denounced the Armor Ordnance
Board as incompetent and nald he would
vote for twenty of the Holland boats ( to
be built to allay, the sensitiveness and ap
prehension of our Â»ea coast ciUea. and bo
means "equal and uniform" in the sense now
asserted by the opponents of the tax. the words
"throughout the United States" are deprived of
all real significance, and sustaining the conten
tion must hence lead to a disregard of the ele
mentary Canon of construction, which . requires
that effect be given to each word of the consti
tution. .
Uniformity Disregarded.
One of the most satisfactory answers to the
argument that the uniformity required by the
constitution is the same as the equal and uni
form clause which has since been embodied in
so many of the State constitutions, results from
a view of the practice under the constitution
from the beginning. From the very first Con
gress down to the present date in laying duties,
Imposts and exclRes the rule of Inherent uni
formity, or. in other words. Intrinsically equal
and uniform taxes, has been disregarded and
the principle of geographical uniformity con
sistently enforced.
On another point of uniformity he said:
It la yet further asserted that the tax does not
fulfill the requirements of geographical uni
muty. for the following reason: As the pri
mary rate of taxation depends upon the degree
of relationship or want of relationship to a de
ceased person, it ia argued that it cannot oper
ate with geoftrophical uniformity, Inasmuch as
testamentary and Intestacy laws may differ In
every Btate. It Is certain that the same degree
of relationship or want of relationship to the
deceased, wherever existing. Is levied on at the
same rate throughout the United States. The
tax Is, uniform throughout the United States
despite the fact that different conditions among
the States may obtain as to the objects upon
which tbe tax ia levied.
With reference to the objections to the
progressive feature of the law, Justice
White said:
Lower Court Erred.
The review which we have made exhibits the
fact that taxes Imposed with reference to the
ability of the person upon whom the burden
is placed to bear the same have been levied
from the foundation of the Government * So
also some authoritative thinkers and a num
ber-of economic writers contend that a pro
gressive lax Is more Just and equal than a pro
portionate one. .In the absence of constitutional
limitations, the question whether It is or Is
not is legislative and not Judicial. The grave
consequences which It Is asserted must arise In
the future if the right to levy a progressive tax
be recognized Involve In the ultimate aspect
the mere assertion that free and representative
government is a failure and that the grossest
abuses of power are foreshadowed unless the
courts usurp a purely legislative function. If a
case should ever arise where an arbitrary and
conflscatory exaction- is imposed bearing the
guiee of a progressive or any other form of
tax. it will be time enough to consider whether
the Judicial power can afford a remedy by ap
plying inherent and fundamental principles for
the protection of .the Individual, even though
there be no express . authority In Â¦ the eonnltu
tlon Â¦ to do so. That the law which we have
construed affords no ground for the contention
that the tax Imposed is arbitrary and conflsca
tory is Â¦ obvious.
â¢ It . follows from the foregoing â¢ that the court
below erred In denying all relief and that it
should . have held the plaintiff entitled to re
cover so much of the tax as resulted from tax-
Ing legacies below J10.000 and from -increasing
the . tax : rate with reference to the whole
amount of the personal estate, of the deceased
from Â¦ which the legacies or distributive shares
were derived.
Justice Brewer dissented on the ground
that the progressive feature of the tax is
a violation of "uniformity," but concur
red on all other points.
Â¦In the cases; Involving the right to tax
Inheritances consisting of Government
bonds, which were handled In an opinion
handed down by Justice Shiras, the court
said:.
iWe think the conclusion fairly to be drawn
from ' the State and Federal cases Is that .the
right to take property by - will or descent Is
derived from and ; regulated by municipal law;
that In assessing a tax upon such right or priv
ilege 5 the Â¦* State may ' lawfully measure or ; flx
the amount of the tax by referring to the value
of the property passing, and that the Incidental
fact: that such property is composed In whole
or : In ; cart of : Federal securities -does not in
validate the tax or the law under which it la
Imposed. .. ,- ": v ' . ;
i This opinion .was rendered in the case
of Plummer vs. â¢ Comptroller : Coler of the
city of > New York and involved- the State
law of New York. ***&*Â®8r*?&8gmsxa
r, Solicitor \ General \: Richards, .who con
ducted â¢ the' ca*e for : the Government be
fore the Supreme Court, later it th* day
would therefore support the amendment
of Stewart.
The committee amendment appropriat
ing $250,000 for the purchase of Gatnman
guns and ammunition was withdrawn.
The amendment was adopted providing
in effect for the removal of the naval sta
tion at Port Royal, S. C, to Charleston.
S C
The bill authorizes the expenditure of
$412,000, but leaves the expenditure of this
money to the discretion of the Secretary
of the Navy, who Is authorized to exam
ine Into the expediency of changing the
station to Charleston, S. C. The amend
ment provides that there must be a depth
of water of at least thirty feet at the new
station.
Hale, in advocating the amendment,
said the committee felt that -no more
good money ought to be sent after bad at
Port Royal.
Chandler offered an amendment reducing
the number of armored cruisers provided
for in the bill from three to two. and the
number of protected cruisers from three
to two. His purpose in offering It. he
said, was to direct attention to the fact
that we are expending too much money
for our navy and too little for the develop
ment of our merchant marine.
"There Is a bill now before this Senate,"
said he, "providing for the development of
our merchant marine which calls for no
larger appropriation than is necessary for
the construction of 'two first class war
vessels. I hope that Congress will not ad
lourn until it has brought this shipping
bill to a vote."
"I have not the slightest idea," said
Teller, "that the shipping bill will be
taken up until after the campaign, and
neither has the Senator (Chandler)."
"I am not a great party leader," .replied
Chandler . sarcastically, "but ' there is no
need that we should rush away from
here before we pass this bill for the ad
vancement of our merchant marine."
Hale expressed the belief that he and
the Senator from New Hampshire would
be much older men than, they were now
before the subsidy bill would be disposed
of.
Chandler withdrew the amendment.
Teller said Chandler knew that his par
ty dared not bring the subsidy bill In. ;
"It is to be shuntedâ to go-over until the
next session of Congress," said he. "Then
I suppose we shall nave the' subsidy bill,
the bill to increase the army to 100.000
men, and puch other measures as cannot
be considered now in . view of the Presi
dential campaign." ;'â¢â¢
McBride of Oregon secured an amend
ment providing for the appointment of a
board of officers to determine the desira
bility of constructing a drydock on the
Columbia River, Oregon. : ,
Tillman offered an amendment provid
ing that no armor should be contracted
for In advance of its actual requirement
by vessels in construction. It was agreed
to. ' <>-:.- Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ ' Â¦ - -.Â¦'Â¦.Â¦.
Pettisrew declared that it was the . pur
pose of the dominant party in Congress to
make these great contracts for war ves
sels and armor in order that it might be
In position to obtain vast contributions to
its campaign fund.
The bill then passed without division.
Nelson of Minnesota ; secured - the pas
sage of an act providing for. free home
steads on the public lands for actual and
bona fide settlers, ana reserving the pub
lic lands for that purpose.' A bill also
passed to apply a portion of the proceeds
of tire sale of public lands to the endow
ment, support and maintenance of schools
or departments of mining and metallurgy
in the several States Rnd Territories, -In
connection with the colleges for the bene
fit of agriculture and the mechanical arts:
-The Senate at 5:45 p.m.- adjourned.
WASHINGTON. May 14.â The Supreme
Court of the United States to-day an
nounced opinions in the cases arising un
der the inheritance tax provision of the
war revenue act and also in a case in
volving the applicability of the State in
heritance tax law of New York to estates
composed of Government bonds. There
were live decisions under the Federal law
and one under the State law, but two of
the former class applied, as did one of the
latter class, to the taxation of Govern
ment bonds. The court held that neither
under the State nor the national enact
ment were national bonds exempt from
taxation. The validity of the general Fed
eral law was affirmed, but it was held to
be purely applicable to legacies and not to
the entire estates of deceased persons, the
court holding that the "tax is on the pass
ing of legacies or distributive shares of
personality, with a progressive rate on
each, separately determined by the sum
of each of such legacies or distributive
shares."
The decisions dealing with the Federal
law as a whole were handed down by
Justice White and those relating to Gov
ernment bonds by Justice Shiras.
Justice Shiras' opinion covered the phase
of the law applying to cases in which es
tates consisting of United States bonds
are taxed. | This opinion held that the
bonds wero subject to this tax.
The principal decision in the list handed
down by Justice White covered the case
of Eben J. Knowlton and Thomas A. Buf
f urn, executors of the estate of
Edwin F.' Knowlton, brought here
from the eastern district of New
York. The opinion of the Circuit
Court was; adverse to the validity of the
law and accordingly it was. reversed. The
opinion is a very. voluminous one and dis
cusses exhaustively every phase of. the
law. ". Referring to the "progressive" fea
ture of the act. Justice Av'hite satd that it
was conclusive that it creates no new
subject of taxation.
Provisions of the Law.
"It simply provides," he said, "for the
progressive rates or. the property men
tioned in the opening sentences, which -is
described exactly as it was in the act of
1864. ..Now, ; as the. act of 1864' taxed not
the whole estate but each particular leg
acy or distributive share, the conclusion
cannot be escaped that the present law
does the same thing, except tnat there is
added thereto a progressive rate."- â¢
Then he took up the question as to
whether the law commands that the pro
gressive: rate shall be measured by the
amount of a legacy or the whole personal
estate, the conclusion being reached that
!t was not the intention to tax the entire
estate, but: the "separate and distinct
Hums or items of personal property pass
ing." The conclusion then was announced
that the tax Is "on the legacies and dis

CHICAGO. May 14. â The Methodist
Episcopal Conference committee on tem
perance, of which Samuel Dickie of Mlch-
Iriui Is chairman and of which Congress
man M. N. Johnson of North Dakota, au
thor and champion of the anti-canteen
law. Is a member, adopted resolutions to
day which, in the minds of a number of
the commltteemen at least, is a direct
Einp at President McKlnley because of his
acquiescence In the decision of Attorney
General Grig&s declaring the law Ineffect
ive.
The resolutions are a portion of the re
port of a sub-committee Into whose hands
the task of preparing the committee's re
port to the General Conference had bÂ«en
placed, and was adopted In the face of a
motion to substitute for It a minority re
port from Dr. Jacob E. Price of the New-
York conference after a two hours* de
bate. In which the members alternately
arraigned and championed President Mc-
Kinley in his stand on the anti-canteen
law. The report was read as follows:
We are. however, chagrined, humiliated and
exasperated ty the puerile and absurd con-
Ftmctlon placed upon the anti-canteen law, so
callfd. by the Attorney General of the United
States, atid. with all due rvpect to hla exalted

After a etormy session the committee on
â¢p'.scopacy to-day decided to recommend
to the General Conference that two new
Bishops be elected to provide for possi
ble deaths on the board during the next
four years. The body voted down a re
port from a sub-committee in favor of a
petition to the conference to eleci a col
ored Bishop. Instead Â«f making a direct
recommendation on this question the com
mittee will repoft a revised version of the
declaration aaopted by the conference of
1*36, recognizing the qualifications of col
ored men to fill the high offices and ad
mitting the need of a colored leader to de
clare the religious work among his Doonle
In the south. The result Is taken a* a de
feat of the movement to secure the elec
tion of a colored man as Bishop at this
conference, as the leaders started out with
the determination to get specific instruc
tions to the conference. Chairman Buck
ley will report these findings to the con
ference to-morrow. Both reports are cer
tain to be bitterly contested on the floor
of the conference.
The time limit for Methodist preachers

Methodists Decide to Appoint a Con

Ecumenical Conference
in London.
DIRECT SLAP AT
PRESIDENT M'KINLEY
CHICAGO. Msy 14.â The Methodist
Episcopal Conference to-day adopted a
motion made by Bishop Hurst that a com
mission be created by the General Confer
ence, consisting of one member from each
general conference district, to select the
i2S delegates to the Ecumenical Methodist
â¢Conference In London. A little politics
was injected into the procedlngs by a
resolution to allow delegates the privi
lege of vacant seats In their delegations
for their friends. This was opposed on
the ground that it gave too much op
portunity for lobbying, and was defeated.
Rev. Albert R. Rich of the Erie <Pa->
conference Introduced a resolution to
make it a violation of a sacred trust to
devote the profits of the Book Concern to
any other object than the support of bu
[Â¦â¢â¢rannuated ministers. This was intro
duced to stop the payment of the ex
penaee of the General Conference out of
this fund and the subsidizing of non-pay
ing official paptrs. Mr. Rich said that If
necessary an injunction should be served
upon the General Conference or those
holding these trust funds to prevent their
diversion to any other channel than that
for which they are Intended. Dr. Eaton
of Troy. N. Y.. agent for the Eastern
liook Concern, made a strong plea lor
the adoption of the resolution.
"In xnv judgment," he said, "we have
too many periodicals in the Methodist
church."
Dr. Lewis Curt of the Western Book
Concern also favored the resolution.
After a ppirited discussion a motion by
I>r. Buckley to lay th* whole matter on
the table finally prevailed by a large ma
jority.
The regular order of the day, the or
eanic law of the church, was then con
sidered, article 10 being read for amend
ment or adoption. This article deflnen the
powers and restrictions of the General
Conference. After some debate the reso
lution was referred for further consider
ation by the committee.
The report of the committee on elec
tions, which was made public Saturday,
recommending that the election of Bish
oj>s be held under the two-thirds rule-,
vi.-.s adopted. Dr. Huckley of New York,
Â«-ditor of the Christian Advocate, made a
Ftrong pita for the adoption of the re
port, which he said would tend to neu
tralize electioneering methods. The re
port was voted on section by section. The
fiction providing for the election of edi
tors of the several Advocates was recom
mitted to the book committee for further
fiction, the Invention being, it is under
stood, to discontinue some of the subsi
dized publications for which editors are
to be selected. The two-thirds rule on
the election of Bishops was then adopted
by an overwhelming vote.
The time of the session was extended to
hear Chairman Buckley's report No. 2
of the committee on episcopacy, the re
port being on the effectiveness of the
board of general superintendents/ It was
adopted after a short debate. It recom
mended that the whole list of present act
ing Bishops be declared effective.

CONFERENCE
DENVER, May 14.â The annual conven
tions of the Western Federation of Miners
and the Western Labor Union opened this
rooming with a Joint public meeting., at
which the welcoming address was deliv
ered by Ready Kenehan. to which replies
were made by President Edward Boyce
of the federation â¢ and President Daniel
McDonald of the union. After the public
meetings the two conventions met In sep
arate session. . .
k. subject which is = much discussed
among the Relegates and which -will be
acted upon by both conventions Is the
influx of Japanese laborers into the United
State* and Canada. President McDonald
*>ald- that unless something was' done by
the Government to restrict the Immigra
tion of Japanese it would become a great
menace to white labor and before long
mizht result In serious troubles.
"I have recently been over the whole
Pacific Coast country, where I learned
that' more than 30,000 Japanese have en
tered the United States in the last year,"
said' Mr. McDonald. "They are practi
cally replacing white labor on all of the
railroads in the Northwest and are grad
ually working their way eastward. The
Northern Pacific and the Great Northern
employ them almost exclusively on the
sections, each gang having a white man
aÂ« boas."
In his speech President Boyce said: "I
will say without hesitation or fear of con
tradiction that in the grandest republic
ever organized In the world we are fast
descending to a condition worse than has
ever existed In any monarchy on earth. It
is time for laboring people to say that no
military despot shall exist In any State
or county of this country. We should
not longer endure the action of the Judges
sitting on the bench of the United States
Supreme Court who issue injunctions re
straining laboring men. There seems no
relief to be expected from any political
organization existing to-day, I am sorry
to say. and all <>ur nope of gaining relief
through politics must come when we come
to the point where we can rely upon our
selves to cast a united vote."
President Boyce named the following
committee of credentials: John MeKenna.
Butte Union No. 1. Montana: Albert V.
Poff, Helvetia Union. Arizona; E. S.
Tlmmons, Gillette Union, Colorado; John
Hayes, Gem Union. Idaho: John McCloud,

Replying to Salisbury's speech, John Dillon, for
merly chairman of the dominant faction of the Irish
members of Parliament, said in an address at Man
chester: "Irishmen can now see more clearly than
ever the work they have to undertake. That task
is to again make it inconvenient and dangerous to
withhold Irish rights. It is not by conciliation and
appeals to loyalty that the grievances of Ireland will
be remedied." Nor did he fail to point out the sig
nificance of the fact that it was just "at the very
moment after the chivalrous reception to the Queen
in Ireland, when an opportunity presented itself to
cement the feeling between the two countries, Lord
Salisbury has misrepresented Irish claims with a
cynical and brutal frankness, offering an absolute non
possumus to the reasonable demands of Ireland."
IRELAND'S REPLY TO SALISBURY.
r\ S might have been expected, Salisbury's speecii
l~~\ to the Primrose League has had the effect of
* *Â¦ exciting resentment among the Irish and
rousing their leaders to more earnest efforts to unite
all factions of the Irish people in a vigorous effort
to bring about a realization of the deeply cherished
desire for local self-government and home rule. In
that respect, therefore, the speech may result in
awakening the British themselves from their dream
of conciliating Ireland by soft words, and convincing
them that if there is to be peace between the two
countries Britain must concede to Ireland the just
demands of her people.

great diffidence I would suggest that tho

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
To send up a lot of disjointed and discordant
declarations from the State convention will darken
counsel rather than illuminate it, and California will
gain a reputation for political wisdom by avoiding
such action.
We submit, then, that all declarations of policy
upon the new issues vhich have arisen since 1896 be
left to the wisdom, foresight and experience which
will represent the party at Philadelphia.
We have before us the interesting task of finally de
feating and destroying Bryanism in the politics of this
republic. Its reactionary threat is a disturbing factor
that menaces every laborer's wages and every busi
ness man's financial stability. The country looks to
the Republican party to meet, defeat and forever de
stroy that threat. It looks to the Republican party
to inflict such impressive punishment upon that sort
of politics as to forever admonish politicians that op
position to all that iÂ«. and building a national policy
on the disease rather than on the health of the coun
try, cannot succeed.
To ndminister this lesson the Republican party re
ci-ires unity of action and all its strength. It can
thereby attract the krge independent vote of the
country, which shuns mere destruction, and believes
in a wholesome constructive policy. This large in
dependent vote sometimes snubs the poll entirely,
even in Presidential years. But when its conscience is
appealed to it becomes the active ally of the party
which makes that appeal.
The State convention can find pleasant duty enough
in calling attention to the beneficent results which
have followed the impiession of the national platform
of 1896 upon n-ition.il affairs, and there is no neces
sity for going into a discussion of policies that are in
embryo, and will receive tentative treatment only by
the National Convention itself. "
The Republicanism. of the administration ought to
be good enough for any Californian, as the prosper
ity that followed that administration has been good
enough for the people of the whole country.
By putting the California Republicans at odds with
the National Convention we can easily introduce dis
cords in the local organization which will cause it to
enter the campaign iii a divided and weakened con
dition.
There is enough for the State convention to do
without attempting to fetter its delegation and put
the party in the State in a false position of antag
onism to the national organization. We had enough
of this four years ago to warn sensible men against
a repetition now. To dogmatize about the status of
the people and territory of our external possessions
kJB be the poorest policy, as the dogmatic declara
tions were in 1896. It will be raising an issue to ob
scure the presentation of domestic policies of the
highest importance, because they concern the welfare
of all our people.
THE Republican State Convention has before it
a plain and serious duty. It will make the dele
gation to the National Convention, and will
perfect the organization which is to conduct the cam
paign. The delegation will simply carry out the con
vention's indorsement of the administration by join
ing in the rcnomination of President McKinley. It
Â»ili also join the rest of the party of the Union in
making the platform a plain summary ot* the results
of Republican rule and a reasonable declaration of the
principles upon which the party will administer the
Government for another four years. When the
National Convention has done this the party will
clign to its action and go into battle.

ART AND ARTISTS
Marius Dahlgren, the artist who played
such a prominent part in the recent real
life drama of the trustful painter and the
wicked auctioneer, wherein the latter de
materialized with Mr. Dahlgren's round
trip fare to Nome, sailed yesterday on the
Aloha for those icy regions. Mr. Dahl
gren goes mining with the S. S. S. Com
pany, a camp of six friends, and intends
to make Cape York his headquarters. He
will stay a year.

pleted a large study of the nude, a com
mission from a Nome merchant, which
will iind its way north about the end of.

Another Californian winning fame
abroad, but this time in Paris, is Miss
Sara Senter Whitney of Oakland, whose
exceptional talent secured her an entrance
into the studio of Rodin. By the kindness
of Mrs. Phebe A. Hearst she will spend
another year with the famous sculptor,
and it is predicted that the work of this
charming California girl will have inter
national place at no far distant date.

A story -Illustrating the reticence of the
Scots is credited to Ian Maclaren. A
train was at a station, when a porter put
his head into a carriage and called out
"Any one for Doun? Change for Doun
Any one for Doun?" 'No one moved, and
in a few minutes the train was speeding
along, not to stop again for nearly an
hour. Then an old Scotswoman turned to
a lady sitting near her and said: I^m
for Doun, but I'd not tell that man so.
She Wouldn't Tell Him.
Thus the bill is to benefit not one class but all
classes of Americans. It is estimated we are now
paying over $200,000,000 annually to foreigners to
carry our commerce for us. In 1898 we carried only
about 8 per cent of our own imports and exports.
Such a policy is wasteful and foolish, and it is cer
tainly time to put an end to it.
Against that charge may be put the statement of
ex-Senator Edmunds, that the bill provides "for. the
systematic* payment limited to a definite period of
time, of a sufficient compensation, and only a suffi
cient one, to American vessels sailing to and from
foreign ports in order to enable them to perform the
voyage with a. fairly full cargo of American produc
tions, and return with a fairly full cargo of imports.
Without these cargoes the ship-owners could not af
ford to make the v'03'ages and thus get the compensa
tion. The effect, therefore, would be to help carry
American cargoes in American ships to every foreign
port where such cargoes could possibly be disposed
of, and thus open American trade in ports where
American vessels are now almost never seen."
By way of specific objection to the bill before the
House the minority report says: "Such a large
amount of subsidy practically put at the disposal of
the few who benefit by this bill cannot but tend to
unite, even more closely than now, the great ship
building, ship-owning and railroad interests cou
oerned in this measure. By the time these few interests
bring in their foreign-owned ships and get their ships
now being built into the subsidy race the $0,000,000
limit will undoubtedly be reached. Hence, it will be
to their interest to combine to stop competition and
to prevent their subsidy rates and profits from declin
ing. We believe that such a combination would be
completed soon after the passage of this bill."
The record of the German merchant marine is even
more striking. In 1885 there was hardly an impor
tant shipyard in Germany: all the large steamship;
of that country were built in Great Britain. A policy
of governmental promotion of the shipping interests
of the empire was established by Bismarck, with the
result that the expansion not only of German ship
ping and shipbuilding, but of German commerce
and German manufacturing for export, has become
one of the marvels of recent years. Within the com
paratively short time since the inauguration of the
Bismarck policy the, merchant marine of Germany
has increased 693 per cent. Germany now builds her
own ships, instead of buying them from Great Brit
ain, and through the advantages the subsidized lines
offer to German merchants and manufacturers, Ger
many has become a close rival of the British in every
market in the world.- "
In refutation of that statement the experience of
every commercial nation in the world can be cited.
Official statistics recently compiled by E. T. Cham
berlain, United States Commissioner of Navigation,
show that in 1873 Japan's steam tonnage was so small
it was classed with â¢'scattering" in the shipping lists
of the world, but now Japan has taken seventh rank
among the nations with respect to merchant marine.
The present subsidy legislation of that country con
templates a possible expenditure of $5,000,000 an
nually, and under its operation the shipping interests
of the country have grown to such an extent that the
tonnage of Japanese steamships clearing from the
United States for Asia in 1898 was greater than the
corresponding American tonnage, and it is, moreover,
noted that her ship-building industry has so far de
veloped that Japan has become, one of the seven na
tions of the world that' can build steelsteamships of
6000 tons. . . , , . ,.
A striking example of the misstatements of the re
port is to be found in the declaration: "It cannot be
shown, from the history of subsidies, tha*t they ever
materially lowered freight rates or increased the com
merce of the countries granting them. Trade condi
tions, and not trade theories, fix the rates which ship
pers will pay and which ship-owners can get. Neither
does the history of subsidies show that any country
has ever built up its merchant marine in this way."
WITH the report of the Democratic minority of
the House Committee on Merchant Marine
and Fisheries, the public has been presented
with a summary of all the objections which the oppo
nents of our merchant marine can offer to the policy
of governmental promotion of our shipping interests,
and to the billnow before Congress. The objections
are of many kinds and include false statements of facts
and erroneous conclusions from facts which are un
disputed.
THE MERCHANT MARINE BILL.
The American Institute of Music in New York pro
poses to raise $2,ooo,oco to erect a great edifice con
taining a hall capable of seating 8000" people, for the
purpose of holding choral and orchestral concerts;
but, while the scheme is a good one, it would be bet
ter to have a number of small auditoriums. When
music gets to be so loud as would be required to fill
a hall of that kind it will cease to be a fine art and
become something of a hippodrome.
After the worry apd drudgery of busi
ness a game of chess Is a relief and re
laxation to the mind. I regard It as a
great preventive of insanity. Scores of
men have their minds wrecked by the
anxieties of business life. Business re
quires concentration of attention and in
tense thought. The result of a false move
In business may be ruin or serious loss.
What better method of mental recupera
tion than a game of chess with a friend.
But there Is no doubt that some of the
chess experts go too far. For instance,
last week in Philadelphia, just before he
sailed for Europe, Pillsbury played blind
folded against twenty tables at the same
time. He won fourteen, drew five and lost
only one game. Such a feat must be an
unendurable tax upon the mind If pro
longed, but Pillsbury declares that he
feels no evil effects.
My opinion is that when a man plays
three or four hours !n an evening ana
goes home and dreams about knights ana
castles and pawns prancing around on the
ceiling it is time for him to stop.
The exercise of any human faculty
tends to develop It, if other faculties are
not neglected. Many a young man has
lost his health and strength by too much
athletics. In all things moderation should
be the maxim. It was Addison who wisely
said: "I think it a cardinal rule of lire
not to be too much addicted toanyone
thing." W. M. DE \ISSER.
lums? Do not journalism and every
other profession contribute more patients
to such Institutions than chess?
{HAVE met Steinitz and watched him
play, and am convinced that there is
some other reason for his insanity
than his chess playing.
Is it chess playing that fills our asy-
1 KNEW Munkacsy very well, and the
news of his insanity was a great sur
prise to me. His was a very marked
â¢ personality in art. He Impressed every
one who met him with his strong per
sonality. Â¦: He was a man of fine physique
and a tireless -worker.
Born a Hungarian, his real name was
Michael Loeb. He took his art name from
Munkacs. the little village in which he
was bornâ a very common habit among
European artists.
His first and perhaps his greatest pic
ture was # "The Last Day of the Con
demned," and it is pleasant to know that
it was an American who enabled him to
complete the' picture. He was living at
the time in a garret in the city of Dussel
dorf, when he was brought to the notice
of John R. Hay of Baltimore. 'Â¦
Mr. Hay â¢ found Munkacsy penniless,
wrapped in a shabby ulster, and working
at- his great picture without either food
or fuel in the room. He at once lent the
artist money, and when the picture was
finished it was bought and sent to Paris,
where it secured for him both fame and
fortune.
He made his home in Paris and his
studio became one of the sights of the
city.
Munkacsy'a madness must have had
some unknown origin. In his youth he
was a cabinet maker, and it is said that
when confined in the asylum. he returned
to his early trade. His skill as an artist
entirely deserted him. This would Indi
cate that the cause of his insanity was
not his art, but perhaps some physical de
fect- of the brain. \
It rarely occurs that a painter finds his
way to a madhouse. Our profession Im
poses a- tremendous strain sometimes in
the effort to attain a result, but it is a
stimulating rather than a depressing
strain. The greater the genius the great
er the madness is a common saying. But
the artistic temperament permits larger
scope for individuality than almost any
other. If Mr. "Whistler, for instance, were
anything but an artist, I presume he
would have been locked up long ago. He
is not in the slightest degree insane, but
his scorn of conventionality would In any
other calling have persuaded people that
he was out of his mind.
There is nothing in the study of art
that tends to create derangement of the
mind. Our calling tranquillizes the brain.
The variety of interests, .themes and
studies which a painter commonly enjoys
does not permit the mind to become in
tense in any one line. Painting should
produce an- even balance and poise of
mindâ the very reverse of insanity.

The time is approaching for a general election in
Great Britain. It is believed that if Roberts achieves
a sufficient success in South Africa to redeem the
reputation of the Ministry Salisbury will adjourn
Parliament this summer. That will enable the Irish
leaders and their friends among the British to bring
the question of justice 'to" Ireland- once more fairly
before the people. It is therefore fortunate that the
speech of the Prime. Minister has directed public at
tention to the issue and confirmed the union of the
Irish. Ireland stands a much better chance to win
now than before Salisbury made his speech. To
that extent the brutal frankness of the Prime Minis
ter has been a benefit to those heintended to injure.
to that of Dillon. The appearance of the two leaders
on the same platform confirms the reports of the
substantial harmony which now. prevails in the Irish
party. The old faction fights which followed the fall
of Parnell appear to have been satisfactorily closed,
and once more Ireland presents" a united front to her
opponents. Redmond himself is reported as saying
the meeting marks the close of a disastrous chapter
in Irish history, and that the fact that for the first
time in a decade he stood on the same platform with
Dillon proves the genuineness of the reunion.
Every hour now 500 people die of starvation -in
India. Every day twelve -thousand gaunt and flesh
less human beings give up the ghost for want of food.
The world cannot remain indifferent to the awful
scene.
The clergy of California, having at hand the or
ganization of their congregations as the means of
working, have made an appeal to the people. There
are in the "United States about 200,000 churches. Each
is an institution, an organization. It is fit and proper
that these should be used in relief of India. Let
every citizen who can spare from his substance even
the smallest amount give it through the relief com
mittee of one of these churches. Ten dollars from
each church in this country would amount to two
millions of dollars. The average should be a hundred
for each church. The organization made by the
American clergy can promptly transmit funds by
cable as fast as accumulated, and within forty-eight
hours after the money is given here it will be saving
life in far India. The Call suggests to the clergy that
by common action they appoint a Sunday for this
contribution to be specially made.
In the United States, so abundantly blessed with
rich resources, it is estimated that we waste every day
as much food as we consume. Every day enough to
feed nearly eighty miliions of Hindoos goes into the
slop barrel in this country. If. by attention to house
hold economy, our people would save what they now
pay for food that is not consumed, but wasted, that
saving would carry the whole suffering population of
India to the next harvest, and would not be at all felt
by our own people.
It would seem that the British Government has also
an inefficient estimate of its responsibility. It has had
the power to abolish Juggernaut and the Suttee. It
has invaded th'us far the religious customs of the peo
ple, rooted in their ancient superstitions, and it has
done this as a concession to the sentiments of West
ern civilization. Why has it not extended its paternal
power into the more material concerns of the people,
to secure their physical welfare? Having the power,
it should have the disposition to take the ryot in
hand and train him in the ways of self-support. It
has done this with the Egyptian fellah, who has had
his landmarks fixed, his property rights secured, his
share of the fruitful overflow of the Nile guaranteed,
and his rights as a producer protected. The result
is that the people of the Valley of the Nile have been
lifted above the pressing want that is the specter of
India. England has done this in Egypt, not as the
master of Egyptian sovereignty, but as the adviser
and administrator of the government of the Khedive.
It she could do this subordinate to the actual sove
reignty, why can she not do it, and more, as the un
disputed ruler of India? The world cannot wait for
the awakening of the British empire to a higher
sense of its duty to India. Millions of human crea
tures are starving. It is said, and we believe wisely,
that the sending of wheat and corn to India is but
little relief. There is plenty of food there, stored by
heartless owners in the godowns all over the stricken
districts. What the people want is money to buy
this food. Funds can be telegraphed to the relief com
mittees right in the midst of the suffering. It is said
by authority that each life may be sustained for the
small sum of two cents a day. One dollar will save
a life for two months. Two dollars will save a life
until harvest. Five dollars will carry a man, wife and
child until the next crop is gathered. Fifty dollars
will carry five families for that period, and a hundred
dollars will save a small village.
NO other famine, ancient or modern, has involved
as many millions of people as are now starving'
in India. More than eighty millions are in dis
tress. That means that a greater population than that
of the United States is starving. The 'reports prove
that there is enough food stored in India to feed them
all and carry them to the harvest. The drought has
so impoverished them that they have no money with
which to buy food. Great Britain's relief system has
so far reached 6nly about five millions of the number,
and seventy-five millions are without succor. Civili
zation is justly appalled by the spectacle. The horror
has its primary cause in the failure of the monsoon
and absence of the rain it brings, but this would not
produce the great disaster that is upon India, except
for the inefficient industrial organization and the peo
ple's lack of foresight. The ryots resemble the liber
ated serfs of Russia in their incapacity to take care of
themselves. In the good years they store nothing for
the bad years. They incumber the land they control
and are reckless of the future in all their industrial
operations. Their careless methods are of course
taken advantage of by the money lenders and usurers,
and when famine comes they are entirely without ac
cumulated resources. In that land there seems to be
less regard for the wants of humanity than elsewhere.
The native factors and money lenders do not seem 10
feel any responsiblity for the people when distress
conies. They have gathered to themselves the sub
stance of the fat years, and are callous to the necessi
ties of their victims when the lean years come to de
stroy them.

THE BITTER END
Railroad Commissioners In
struct Attorney Gen
eral to Act.
Courts Will Decide Whether or Not
th.e Southern Pacific llust Obey
th.e Action of the State
Board. *
>
Within a few days the Fresno rate case
will be in; the courts and then â well, time
alone will tell what the final outcome will
be. The Railroad Commissioners at their :
regular "meeting yesterday afternoon i
nassed a resolution authorizing and direct
ing Attorney General Ford to take the
necessary steps to compel the Southern
Pacific Company to restore the $3 75 rate
from San Francisco to Fresno and he will
prepare legal papers to-morrow to ac
complish that result.
When the meeting was called only Com
missioners Edson and Laumelster were
present, Blackstock having gone East on
Saturday to attend the Milwaukee con
ference. After a reading of the minutes
the following resolution was Introduced
and Immediately adopted:
Resolved, That the Attorney General bÂ« and
he is hereby authorized and Instructed to take
such proceedings as be may be advised are
necessary to compel the obedience by the
Southern Pacific Company to the order of this
board made on the 7th day of May, 1900. In the
case of Moore vs. the Southern Faciflc Com
pany. , \
Late in the afternoon Attorney General
Ford received a copy of the order and he
at once began work on the case. One of
two courses is left open to him. he says
âto petition for a writ of mandate or to
petition for a writ of injunction. The for
mer course is positive in character and
will probably be followed by the Attor
ney General in this case. By the issuance
of a writ of mandate the railroad com
pany would be compelled to restore the
53 75 passenger rate. Injunction proceed
ings are negative in character, but more
efficacious and speedy. If the writ is pe
titioned for the application to the courts
will be to enjoin the railroad company
from charging more 'khan J3 75 for the
ticket.
The Southern Paclfic^aw department
will fight the case, cUThning that the $3 75
reduction from the old rate of $5 90 was
not a reduction **o meet competition, but
specialâ something in the nature of what
E. O. McCormick, general passenger
agent, calls a commutation of rights be
tween the railroad company and the pas
senger. He claims that all the time the
$3 "5 tickets were being offered to the pub
lic the $5 90 were also on sale. The re
duced rate.' ticket allowed no stop-over
privileges. This is the contention of the
Southern Pacific. The Commissioners re
fused to accept this shrewd technical con
struction of the reduction and now It will
remain for the courts to settle the mud
dle.
Florence Gordon was held to answer
yesterday* before the Superior Court by

Henry Spellman denies that he commit
ted suicide by asphyxiation last Saturday
night or at any other time or in any way
whatever. As Mr. Spellman Is very much
alive and kicking the inference is natural
that he Is not the one mentioned as hav
ing passed into the other world. The man
who died was William Klinge, 61 years
old. The Coroner will hold an inquest
to-day. Mr. Spellman's name got on the
Morgue clip as the person who notified
the office. There will be no inquest on
him.

There will be an exodus to-day of ves
sels for the gold fields; Collectively they
will take away more than 1800 passengers.
This is only the commencement. The ex

Stfuart-street wharf at 5 p. m. with 750
passengers. The Luella, with 400 passen
gers, will get away from Mission-street
wharf about 3 p. m. The Alaska Commer

gers will get away from Beale-street
wharf promptly at 2 p. m., while the San
Pedro with alout 350 passengers is sched
uled to sail from Vallejo-street wharf at
5 p. m. The chances' are It will be to
morrow morning before she gets away.
The Rainier is the third boat sent out by
the Alaska Commercial Company, and in
succession she will be followed by the St.
Paul. San Bias, San Jose and San Juan*
The next big steamer to get away will
be the ex-transport Zealandia, which is
scheduled to sail Monday next with 750
passengers.

Charles Lynch, an employe of the Union
Iron Works, was injured on the steamer
St. Paul yesterday. He was walking down
the gangway when he stumbled and fell
overboard. In falling he struck his head
against the side of the ship and was only
rescued after some difficulty. He was
taken to the Harbor Hospital, where Dr.
Thome found he was suffering from a
slight concussion of the brain. After care
ful treatment Lynch recovered sufficiently
to be sent home.

Senator Sails for Cape Nome
With a Crowd of Gold
Hunters.
Four More Steamers, All Loaded
Down "With Passengers, Are
Scheduled to Follow in
Her Wake To-Day.
The Pacific Coast .Steamship Company's
Senator sailed yesterday from Broadway
wharf for Nome with 169 passengers
aboard. About 600 more are booked to
join the vessel at Seattle and then she
will have the full complement allowed
her by the agents. When serving as a
transport the Senator, took 1054 soldiers
from here to Manila, but the company
does not wish to crowd the gold hunters,
so only about 700 passengers will be taken
north on her.
Broadway wharf was crowded with
people to see the fortune seekers away.
The Senator was scheduled to sail at 11
a m.. but it was an hour later before the
baggage could be got aboard and the
lines cast off. Once away from th^ wharf
it was not long before the ex-transport
was under a full head of steam and rac
ing for the Golden Gate. â¢
On the Senator is a party of thirty-five
men who are going north for the Nome
River Gold Mining Company, of which F.
H. Busby and H. Radjeski are managers.
Mr. Busby was to have accompanied the
party, but he was unable to do so owing
to the death of his wife last night.
Fred W. Swanton, formerly manager of
the Big Creek Power Company of Santa
Cruz, and also of the baseball team from
the same place, is also a passenger. He
is taking with him a mining plant with a
capacity of 400 tons a day. The machinery
will be placed on claims owned by Mr.
Ex-Transport Senator Off for Cape Nome.
"I think the church of to-day Is not
doing what it ougiit to do for the ad
vancement of the Redeemer's kingdom.
Nothing flourishes to-day as does mate
rialism. There is the unbelief of to-day.
I do not mean the. unbelief that is In the
world, but the unbelief that is In the
church.**
He then dwelt at length on higher crit-
Iclcin, concerning which he made the fol
lowing: remarks:
"We ministers dare not contend against
higher criticism â dare not contend against
it for fear of being spoken of as unlet
tered men. What shall we have left If
thla work of unbelief continues? For lit
tle by little the Bible is beinff thrown
aside and its doctrines, as we believe
them, questioned. We need nothing so
much as a thorough revival of pentecos
tal religion. Science in its most erratic
and irreverent days never did one-thou
sandth part as much to unsettle conll
dence In the divine revelation as the im
mature, half-digested and undemonstrat
ed theories which our critics have been
putting forth have done. Without ques
tion they are the religious pedants of the
cay and are more dogmatic than Calvin
could ever have been.
"It Is not the Bible which Is suffering
at their hands, but it is the faith in the
Bible which is imperiled. They might as
well shoot peas at Gibraltar with a child's
popgun as to try to undermine the good
book.
"A revlx-al would restore an evangelical
accent to the preaching of the times. One
has only to consult the church advertise
ments in the Saturday papers to learn
how loose, mushy, how theoretically
baseless and almost pointless is much of
the present day and pretended up-to-date
preaching in the average Christian pul
pit. The old. old story is not sensational
enough; spirituality is too unpopular; a
sermon on sin would not draw. But aft
not the ministers mistaken with this mat
ter? While they are trying to please the
people with lectures and essays on poli
tics, sociology and ethics, what are the
results? The people are losing their re
spect and their use for the church and
are drifting from It. The preaching of
the cross may in the present conditions
anger men and thin our congregations for
a time, but It will fill the churches with
people and with the power of salvation
in the end."
Rev. G. TV. Phillips of Oakland read a
paper before the Congregational ministers

Lee Johnson, the far-famed writer of
ragtime melodies, has been made co-re
spondent In a tuit for divorce brought by
Max B. Goldmen against his child-wife.
Pauline, the lG-year-old daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. B. Barasch. who conduct a res
taurant at 619 Montgomery street.
While the husband makes serious accu- ,
sations against his bride of only six
months and the well-known composer of
"coon" songs, Goldman's parents-in-law
put a very different ri!-as<* <-n th** "Â»Â«Â¦<Â» >>v
showing that less than three weeks ago
their daughter brought a suit agrainat
Goldman, charging him with acts oi ex
treme cruelty committed within two weeks
after their wedding, on November 5 last.
That Goldman should have opened at
tack on his youthful spouse before giv
ing heed to the complaints lodged against
him ie deemed by the girl's family as pe
culiar.
The husband's charge of wrongdoing
consists of an allegation that he saw his
wife and Johnson at the California Hotel
last Wednesday afternoon about 2:30
o'clock in a compromising position. On
the other hand, the wife, backed by her
mother, denies that there was a suspicion
of wrong, and nay further that had it not
been fnr an alleged detfctlve. who was
with Goldman at the time, matters would
and could have been readily explained.
Despite Goldman's charge Johnson re
tains the friendship of the Barasch fam
ily, with which he has been on most in
timate terms for many years. Mrs.
Barasch makes the following statement in
her daughter's behalf:
"Mr. Johnson was like a brother to my
daughter. He .has been our close friend
for years, and will continue to be. Gold
man knows this relationship, but he has
been trying to trap my daughter ever
elnce she brought suit against him. Last
Wednesday afternoon Mr. Johnson was
on his way to the California Hotel to
transact some business. He met my
daughter accidentally and asked her to
wait for him. Instead of standing on the
street corner, at Mr. Johnson's invitation
she stepped into the public dining-room
of the hotel and was drinking a glass of
lemonade. They sat there for a moment,
when suddenly Goldman and his com
panion, a Chinatown guide or detective,
broke in upon them.
"Mv daughter started to speak to Gold
mar. * when the detective shouted. 'Don't
talk 'to them.' and they made off. That
is the fact upon which this charge is
made.
"This accusation comes from a man who
struck his wife two weeks after their
marriage, and who even borrowed the
money from me to pay for her wedding
ring and hasn't yet paid for Jr. I gave my
consent to their marriage because I be
lieved Goldman was an honest, hard
working man, who would make a good
home for my child. He cruelly deceived
us both. ' .
"Mr Johnson has known my daughter
since Vhe was a baby. It is an outrage
he should be so infamously accused. Let
Mr Goldman answer the charges made
against him before he tries to hatch ac
cusations against hip wife."
Goldman is a tailor, recently employed
by Lilienfleld & Co. .....
When informed of the fact that he oc
cunied the unpleasant position of core-
Fpondent In the Goldman divorce proceed
ings Mr. Johnson expressed nurprlse and
volunteered the statement that the plain
tiff In the action had evidently been mis
""1 am well acquainted with Mrs. Gold
man " he said, "and am very friendly with
h<-r family. I have known the young wo
man for some time and our relations have
never been otherwise than frlrndly. That
Mr Goldman should see fit to attack the
character of hi? wife is a matter which I
cannot control, but in the final determina
tion cf the Issues of the case I am con
fident that I can establish the truth and
prove that the attack was unwarranted.
"Mr. Goldman lays. It seems, considera
ble stress on our visit to the California
Hotel, but in view of the fact that we
went no further than the public dining
room I am of the opinion that this meet-
Ing furnishes but plight basis for a charge
of unfaithfulness against the young wo
man.
"In view of the friendly relationship
which haÂ« exist*Â»d between this young wo
man, her family and myself for years. It
Is unfortunate that Mr. Goldman should
have seen fit to couple my name with his
young wife as he has done. His insinua
tions, however, can be easily disproved;
and I shall continue to enjoy the young
women'* friendship and that of her fam
ily as I have done in the past."

Isaac of Marln County. Costello and
Devlin chartered a launch and spent the
forenoon touring the bay shore. They
landed a little below El Campo for lunch
nnd when It was consumed the members
of the party dispersed themselves In neg
lige attitudes to let the calming process
of digestion get in Its work. Costello,
however, Is so full of energy that this
Inertness soon palled on him and, calling
on Devlin to join him, he announced that
he was going In swimming. Devlin, noth
ing loth, quit his shady retreat and aerial
housebuilding, and together the twain
plunged Into the waves which decorate El
Campo beach with its fringe of tomato
cans, dead onions and other debris. Now,
El Campo, though in the^ county, is not
quite remote from civilization, and the
feminine visitor to its shores would have
possibly sustained a severe shock at the
vision of the classic forms of Costello and
Devlin disporting themselves in the bay
as Innocent of clothing as Raphael Weill's
rejected Bacchantes. This thought invad
ed the brainpan of Mclsaac, and a blush
mantled his cheek at the thought of
frightened or shocked femininity In the
county of which he is District Attorney.
He mentioned his misgivings to Emmet
Hayden and found that he,, too, was ap
prehensive of the results of a casual sum
mer girl's appearance. Then, having laid
a plot, the conspirators withdrew, accom
panied by the swimmers' clothes, which
had been left In their care. A few mo
ments later two burly Deputy Sheriffs
hailed Devlin and Coetello.
â¢ "Here, come out of that," floated acros3
to the ears of the astonished grand mar
shal. After a little parley the swimmers
came ashore. "Now, then, you come
aiong with us."
"What for?" asked Costello.
"You're under arrest. No monkeying,
mind, or"
Devlin and Costello stared at each other.
"Where are our clothes?" said Devlin.
"We can't go without them."
"I say, look here, I know Emmet Hay
den; he'll put this all straight; let's go
to him." cried Costello. But to all propo
sitions the aeputles remained deaf. Then,
lust as the two swimmers were being
dragged away there appeared on the scene
Mclsaac and Hayden.
"I say, Mac," said Costello, "tell these
fellows to let us go."
"Give us our clothes," said Devlin.
"Can't Interfere with the officers," fllnt
ily replied Mclsaac.
"You must have done something to de
serve this," added Hayden.
Then, after half an hour of shivering
expostulation on the part of the unclothed
prisoners Mclsfiac called the josh off. and
rehabilitated, Devlin and Costello piloted
the crowd to the nearest bar, where all
were sworn to deepest secrecy over the
grand marshal's experience.

INTO TROUBLE
Execution Scene in "The Wizard of tne wie;"
ANGRY HUSBAND
FIRES SEVERAL
SHOTS AT WIFE
Martin Johnson, a Bartender,
Attempts to Shoot His
Spouse.
Woman Leaps Through a "Window
and Then Makes a Fierce Strug
gle for the Possession of
a Pistol.
. Johnson, formerly a bartender
oh the Barbary Coast and recently from
Alaska, made, a desperate attempt last
night to murder his wife, from whom he
has been separated for some time, in a
house at- 1405 Montgomery street. He
fired three shots from a revolver, but
none of them took effect. Before he could
shoot a fourth time the woman clutched
his hand and in a fearful struggle that
followed he injured her so severely that
she had to be sent to the Receiving Hos
pital.
According to the woman's story she has
been separated from her husband Tor
some time. He went to her house last
night and a quarrel was tho result of his
visit. She says he has bothered her on
other occasions and that hi- was looking
for trouble last night. After an exchange
of angry words he drew a revolver and
tired three times. Every bullet went wild.
The frenzied woman made a dash for a
window, and jumped through it. The glass
cut a deep wound In her forehead and she
rushed, bruised and bleeding, along the
street. .
Johnson gave chase and followed his
wife into a vacant lot. where he over
took her. When sho realized that he was
closo upon her she turned suddenly and
grasped the pistol just as he was about to
lire again. A struggle for tho possession
of tho weapon then took place and lasted
until the woman's screams attracted the
attention of people in tho neighborhood.
Johnson then threw away the pistol and
made his escape.
Police Officers Rob Silver and J. Duane
made a search for the man. His hiding
place was M length disclosed by some
boys and ho was found to be secluded
under a house about a block from the
scene of the trouble. They called to him
to come out and surrender, but he refused
to do so and the policemen prepared to
take him by force. After a short struggle
they handcuffed their man and took him
to the California-street police station,
where he was charged with assault to
commit murder. . si , Â¦
' In extenuation of the charge Johnson
accused his wife of unfaithfulness und
says she fired the phots at him. He'claima
he went to the house for the purpose of
seeing his two children and thought that
his wife would bo away. During a heated
discussion, he says, she pulled a revolver
and shot at him. The woman's mother
and several other persona who were wit
nesses deny his statements.

ARMY INTELLIGENCE.
OAKLAND, May 14.â Mrs. P.nebe Hearst
gave her annual garden party to the grad
uating class of the University of Califor
nia to-day at Hacienda del Poso del
Verona, her country home near PleaH
anton. A special train conveyed her
guests', numbering "about 200, to Verona
Station, where they were met and driven
in carriages to the hacienda. Among the
guests were President and Mrs. Wheeler.
The senior class was largely represented.
Mrs. Hearst was assisted in receiving
by Miss Agnes Lane, her niece. Lunch
eon was served on the lawn, while a band
and a Hawaiian orchestra dispensed mu
sic from opposite ends of the grounds.
After luncheon the guests were enter
tained in the grove on the hillside above
the hacienda. Mrs. Hearst conducted her
guests about the art galleries, and showed
them the treasures of Del Verona.

THE GRADUATING CLASS
California.
"An American Citizen" at the California
Thpatrr again' attracted a large audience.
ThÂ«* Nelll company grows In favor each
Tlvoli.
'"The Wizard of the ICilc" commenced
Us third week at the Tivoli Opera-house
last night, and the large audience showed
by generous applause that the play is as
popular as Â«>vor. Forris Hart man and Al
fred C. Wheelan kept the fun going, and
the songs of Helen Merrill, Tom Greene.
Annie Meyers, William Schuster and
Frances Graham had to be repeated. The
Fercnade, one of the prettiest things in
the opora, was charmingly" rendered and
the "Starlight" part song was encored
ajrain Â»nd again. ThÂ«* splendid chorus and
orchestral work are features of the opera
which should eclipÂ»e the ten weeks' run
rÂ«v< ntly made by the "Idol's Eye."
Some Â«:po<3 people have been added to
the Chutes programme. Raygton and
Rayford, London comedians: Harry
Holmes and his "Dining Dog Dandy";
George Trump, hand balancer, and the
DcckmsM. champion bag-punchers, are
the novelties and all bid fair to make a
hH. Dp Cuneo, Castle and Frotto and
Warde have changed their specialties and
Captain George Whistler and Paul Bow
rrs will appear on the lake every after
noon and evening.
Columbia.
"The Evil Eye" began Its second week
to a fair audience last night at the Co
lumbia, and there was no abatement of
the merriment caused by the funny iCid
and Nod and Peleg Kalsenhelmer. The
electric dance was, as usual, the great
pcenic effect of the play, and wag heartily
encored.
OlymplA.
' There Is a big bill at the Olympla this
vw'k and every number laÂ«t night was
well received. Deets and Don and Alice
Raymond are Ptill prominent features on
tbe programme. . -
There's a bunch of pood things at the
Orphoum this week, with enough variety
to please all tastes. Ezra Kendall, the
king pin of all monologists, ought to be
tak* n every evening after dinner as a safe
cure for dyspepsia. And. if the old adage
"Laugh and grow fat" holds true, then
th<Â» town should bÂ«? full of heavyweights
all the natural result of Kendall-Induced
laughter. Other top notchers on the
preat Orpheum bUl include Louise Gun
rilrg. sweet singer of Scotch songs, the
Newsboys' Quintet. Milton and Dollie No
bles in their brisk little comedy, "Why
Walker Reformed." and the KJelsts with
something entirely new in the musical
clown line, backed up with a taking mise
en-Kcene of e'.ectric.il comical black art.
Orpheuin.
Grand Opsra-House.
Morocco's extravaganza company ex
cha.ng'ed its usual mode of action for the
Held of musical comedy, and its perform
ance of "The Lady Slavey" last evening
Â«;;.Â« the be?t It has done so far. While the
book cots not fall into any danger of mak
ing its author famous, the music is rather
bright and brisk and the tnaiiy melodious
alrt, kept the audience In good humor
throughout the evening. The reappear
ai.cv cf Arthur Wooley was the signal
:<jr prolonged applause, and it was evi
aert that he is a great favorite here.
His comedy taient had ample opportu
nity io assort itself In various ways. Par
ticularly effective was his rendition of the
so! g "Down the Hill Went the Lady on
Her Wheel." Isabelle Underwood was the
Ftar of the evening, and that she did full
jut.ice to her responsible role was evi
denced bjr the flowers and applause that
rewarded her for her excellent inpersona
tion.
liÂ« sides possessing a contralto voice of
power and rtfonar.ee' Miss Underwood Is
very handsome, clashing and vivacious.
As a Mjubrette she is certainly a brilliant
euceeps. Ethel Strachan did some of her
Clever work as Marjorie. The rnanage
rr.t-:u has not made any mistake in giving
this gifted young actress some opportu
nity to display her many accomplish
ments.
Harry Cashman never fails to bring out
the humorous part of the character he
may represent. He it= a comedian of high
m^rit. and that h*Â» made a hit last evening
was fully Croons) rated by the fact that
Up created much laughter and earned a
iloni share of the applause. Last even
ing was Forrest S^abury's first venture
ir.to fomic opera ard it proved very suc
cesxfnL His "IkH-" was ingenious and
unique. He Is a clever young fellow.
The chorus sang exceedingly well, was
r.iridsoinely garbed, and the several spe
cialties were worthy of the applause be
stowed upon them.
Fischer's Concert Eousp.
The double bill is crowding Fischer's
Concert House nightly. The crowd comes
early in the evening to hear the prison
t-^f>r\f from "Faust," pung by the talented
Italian trio. Signoiina Barduccl wins a
triple er.core nightly by her splendid act
ing and singing: Badaracco, the popular
tenor, wins double laurels as Faust and
in "Rigoletto." He combines with a splen
did phynioue and handsome face a voice
of great Btragtb and sweetness.
The hcr.crs of the evening were evenly
divided bc-tween the tenor and the prima
donna. Sipnor Ahramoff made a good Me
phisto arri strong Sparafucile. Signorina
i*U' rcri. v.ho sings Gelda. appears to bet
ter advantage than in any of the other
operas, and in voice a.nd appearance
makes an ideal Golda. Signorina Poliet
tini if. as alwayp. the true artiste, and in
her dm t with Vargns. her single selection
and thr> opera does not strike a single
fal**Â» notiÂ». In the orchestral selections
A'jjruFt Hinrichs has wisely intermingled
thf> mfJody of the great masters with the
Jinn'.lr.g ragtime ditties of the later bards.
As a whole th*> performance is one that
could not +><* witrÂ»<*!Â«sed anywhere else in
America for four times the money.
' 'The Malster of Wood Barrow," which
Â¦wus presented at the Alcazar last night,
is a cross between the melodrama and the
rumantic drama, but at the same time has
dwjdedly attractive features. The play
Â¦was seen here seven years ago, but It was
greeted by a large audience last night.
w!;ich wanned up to genuine enthusiasm
Â«..< the j>lot developed. The story is a sim
ple one. founded upon the reckless adven
tnrea of a Devonshire lad who Inherits a
fortune and makes a show of himself,
cnJy 10 lose the wealth upon the appear
ance of the real heir. He discovers that
he is not cut out for a pport and concludes
lhat he Is best calculated for the old farm
wh< re he was born. The play is given* in
three acts, which form a series of very
interesting pictures. It also carries some
tMal*Â»ct that puts Krnest Hastings and
Mi.v* Howe upon their mettle. Mr. Hast-
Jr.g.-- is ihe niaister of Wood Barrow, and
In.s aptitude for creating dialect and fol
lowing mannerisms was fitly displayed
last night in his presentation of the char-
DCta at Allen Kollitt.
As Clara Dexter, tne adventuress, Irene
Everett Arew out the sinfulness in the role
vrltn striking force: in fact, i; was one of
u. e best pieces of wcrlc she has so far
l>cen seen in at this house. George Web-
Fter made an excellent Luke Cranbourne,
aod Howard Srott a PiRin. As Richard
Hm.nirisf.ord. Edwin Emery showed care
ful sÂ»iuuy or the character, and the same
t-an be said of George Nichcls as Baron
von Shorr. Miss Howe, who is always
jroud. made an excellent Mrs. Rollitt, and
in Deborah Deacon Laura Crews gave
tr.at character a careful interpretation.
"The Master of Wood Barrow" is ore
of the bt-Bt pieces the Aicazar has had on
in some time and is sure to do a big
week's business. A revival of "The But
ti-riiit-s" will follow.

VII. HIGH-SPEED TELEGRAPH
SYSTEMS.
Under the original system of telegraphy,
with a single wire, the speed with which
messages could be sent or the number of
words a minute was limited by the ca
pacity of the operators in sending and
taking. If there were no reason why the
telegraph lines could not be multiplied In
definitely there would be no limit to the
number of messages that could be sent
In a day or in an hour, for as many dif
ferent lines could be used with the In
struments and operators at each end as
the desired speed called for. But the
erection and maintenance of a telegraph
line Is an expensive matter. There has
been, therefore, a continuous effort to use
one line or two for as many messages as
possible at the same time. By special ar
rangement of circuits and Instruments In
the "duplex" and "quadruplex" systems
it is possible to send several messatres
over the same wires at the same time
without confusion, and various devices
have been brought forward from time to
time for increasing the number that can
be so sent. Speed Is gained also by the
use of machines for sending and receiv
ing, instead of the hand work or opera
tors. The Hughes printing telegraph does
this, and has been very widely used for
many years. However, if several ma
chines can be worked at the same time
over one line there is still further gain.
The most recent system working on this
principle is that of Professor Henry A.
Rowland.
Rowland's Multiplex Printing Tele-
graph.
Little more than a year ago a public
test of this system was made between
Jersey City and Philadelphia. It has not
yet gone Into commercial use and all the
details have not been made public, but
the main features of the. system can be
described.
The lines can be duplexed In the usual
way and beyond this point multiplexing
is obtained In a manner that Is not new.
although it Is said that the arrangement
for the purpose Is particularly efficient
and successful. The general method re
ferred to Is the use of a revolving com
mutator at each end of the line, by means
of which the line Is devoted successively
for very brief Intervals to different sets
of Instruments. The commutators must
evidently synchronize exactly for success
ful operation; that iÂ». at the moment that
the commutator brush at the sending end
is on the segment connected with ma
chine A, the brush at the receiving end
must be in contact with the segment for
the corresponding receiving Instrument,
A. Otherwise there will be confusion of
messages or failure to receive. A syn
chronizing arrangement of this nature has
been in use in the Delancy system for
many years.
The Rowland system Is peculiar In that
the line current employed Is alternating
In character, of a uniform' frequency; for
example, eighty alternations a second.
The commutator brush Is In connection
with any one transmitter long enough for
the transmission of ten complete cycles
and the signals consist in the omission
from these ten cycles of one or more half
wave; lengths. Â¦- By differently combining
these omissions, therefore, a great num
ber of different signals may be sent. The
signals are received by machines so con
structed that a given combination causes
the printing of a particular Â¦ letter on a
tape or an ordinary letter page. ,
The transmission is by hand, and each
transmitting machine, therefore, requires

RECENT SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES.
In a test between New York and Chi
cago, the longest distance over which the
system has been tried, over 1000 words a
minute were sent, and at Budapest, over
a shorter line, a speed of 2S0O words a
minute has been reached.
The receiving Instrument Is essentially
a telephone receiver, and Its diaphragm
moves toward the magnet pole or away
from It In accordance with the direction
of the current impulses sent over the line.
These motions are recorded photograph
ically. Fcr this purpose a small concave
mirror Is flexibly connected to the dia
phragm . and pointed In such a manner
that a turning movement is produced
which magnifies the diaphragm move
ments and causes a small spot of intense
light to move back and forth over a strip
of sensitized paper on a rapidly moving
drum. The positive line Impulse thus pro
duces an upward deflection of the spot of
light and a negative Impulse produces a
downward deflection. The first corre
sponds to the Morse dash and the second
to the dot. The corresponding characters
are shown In the cut.
This system perfected In Austria, is In
many respects a contrast to the Rowland
system. In principle It la extremely sim
ple, depending for Its high speed upon thÂ«
rapidity of action and sensitiveness of a
diaphragm much like that of a telephone.
The signals are transmitted by a ma
chine which can be run at a high rate,
and before It can be sent the message
must be recorded upon a strip of paper
by means of holes punched in it at suita
ble distances. This strip of prepared pa
per Is then passed very rapidly under two
small brushes so connected to batteries
and the line that the contact of one brush
sends a current over the line In one direc
tion, the contact of the other brush a cur
rent In the other direction. The capacity
and Inductance of the line and the Influ
ence of the natural period of vibration of
the receiving diaphragm are neutralized
by the use of properly adjusted condensers
and Inductance colls.
The Pollak-Virag System.
At the receiving end a double-ended pol
arized relay is actuated by the line cur
rent. One armature connects with tho
synchronizing apparatus and regulates
the driving motor; the other armature
connects through the commutator with
the local selective relays. There are ten
of these for each receiving Instrument, so
arranged that for each combination of
half-wave omissions the type wheel Is
caused to print a particular letter. The
paper is then moved ahead, all the relays
are released and are ready for the next
signal.
an operator, each of whom has before hira
a keyboard with forty keys. These keys
are so interlocked with the ten contacts
that the depression of a particular key
causes the omission of a certain definitely
arranged set of half-periods, and conse
quently the printing of the correspondinsr
character by the machine at the receiving
end.
Private Heixnburger Turned a Peace
ful Hotel Into a Very Noisy
Battle Field.
George Heimburger, an unattached
member ot the United States Hospital
Corps, went on a spree yesterday morning
and sought refuge in the Ahlborn House
on Grant avenue. After half an hour's
rest he imagined that he was in Wolfville
and proceeded "to shoot 'em up some."
After announcing his intention he drew
his revolver and began shooting at the
gas globes In the rooms and wound up his
performance by smashing several win
dows with the butt of the weapon.
Patrolmen Alexander and Murphy of the
California-street police station outflanked
him when he was out of ammunition and
captured him. He was charged with dis
charging firearms within the city limits
and with malicious mischief.

ON ADMISSION DAY
POLICE SERGEANTS
WILL BE PROMOTED
Charter Makes It Mandatory That
There Shall Be Ten Lieutenants
on the Force.
There will be a chance for promotion
for some sergeants in the Police Depart
ment. Up to yesterday the opportunity
had escaped the attention of Chief Sulli
van.
The charter says that there, "shall be
one lieutenant for each fifty police offi
cers." At present there are only five, and
in the appropriation for the department
submitted by the Chief six lieutenants
are provided for, the extra one being for
the City Prison.
The Chiefs attention was drawn to the
mandatory provision in the charter, and
on looking It up he said he thought it
read "may" Instead of "shall." and at
once said that he would have the matter
rectified.
When 4 Captain Bohen retired It left a
vacancy as captain, but City and County
Attorney Lane gave the opinion thai
there was no vacancy, as the charter
read: "There shall be one captain for
each 100 police officers." As there were
only &05 officers five captains wero
enough. The same reasoning would ap
ply to lieutenants.
The Chief is also entitled to 600 men. aa
the charter allows one officer for each
500 inhabitants. According to the last
census the population was 300,000. It is
considerably more now.
Takes Advantage of His Presence at
California University Medical
Alumni Banquet to Vent
His Displeasure.
Mayor Phelan took advantage of a privi
lege accorded him to speak at the banquet
of the Alumni of the Medical Department
of the University of California at the Pal
ace Hotel last night, to vent his spleen
on the press for its successful attack on
his Board of Health on. the occasion of
its recent attempt to loot the public treas
ury by foisting on the city a bubonic
plague scare that was proved to be a
larce After costing the city hundreds of
thousands of dollars in casn and traue he
nad the effrontery to attempt to poison
the minds of the graduates against the
press by pretending to instruct them in
the ethics.
The subject of "Public Sanitation' gave
the Mayor a pretended excuse, and he
commenced his attack almost as soon as
he got on his feet.
"1 will have to apologize, he said, for
the Board of Health and that I am either
directly or indirectly connected with it.
Vou eee, I read the papers and I know
whereof I speak. Why snould the medical
men who comprise that board attempt to
give the city good sanitation when it is
not to their pecuniary benerit to do so?
That U the ethics of the press, and I am
sure we must all agree t&at the press is
always right and that it works for the
good of the city. But, speaking seriously,
the mission of the Board of Health Is
misunderstood by the press because its
zeal outruns its discretion. Its mission
must not be thwarted even though,
through Its loyalty, it must suffer the
abuse and adverse criticism of the scurvy
politician and, if I may use the expression,
the scurvier Journalist."
Aside from the scurrilous attack of the
Mayor the bancjuet was a very pleasant
affair. About 15i> covers were laid. Dr.
Gardner Perry Pond made an excellent
toa.Â»ttnaster. After a bountiful feast the
following toasts were responded to:

list, is at present stenographer for the
Board of Public Works ana has proved
himself to be a competent employe.
Though furnished with the three highest
ellgibies on the * list the board will prob

stenographer. Miss Sullivan is now em
ployed In the Street Department and will
have to resign unless there are enough
positions to cause the seventh place to

say Just how many places are to be lilltd
as some departments are carrying stenog
raphers under the guise of clerks.
The important matter of holding the big
examination for clerks came up and while
no definite date was fixed it was decided
that examinations should be finished dur

for these clerkships, which embrace
nearly all the positions in- the hall. Those
now holding the positions will have the
advantage given by experience In answer

The well-laid plot of the Eastern syn
dicate of track gamblers to reopen the
gates of Ingleside failed ignorainiously
yesterday at a meeting of the Board of
Supervisors, and Reed's ordinance pro
luoiting poolselling on dog or horse races
was adopted by a vote of ten to five. The
Mayor, recognizing the vast "Importance
of such legislation to the community at
large, affixed his signature to the meas
ure immediately and it is now a law of
tne municipality.
Desperate efforts had been made by the
racetrack contingent to defeat the meas
ure, as it meant that the legal' defect In
the ordinance now on the statute books,
which is substantially the .same as the
one adopted yesterday, would be discov
ered In the litigation brought by the man
agers of the coursing park and thus nul
lified by a court decision.
Supervisor Reed stated that the meas- '
ure prohibiting pools on dogs and horses
had been recommended by the commit
tee in the nature of a compromise. He
was satisfied that no severe ordinance
could be passed. His ordinance excluded
boxing contests from its restrictions, but
he suggested that the opponents" of the
manly art were at liberty to present a
bill covering that branch of sport, liran
aenstein asked Ileed if he tnought pool
rooms were an evil.
-if you will be guided by my reply,",
said Reed, "L say tney are."
"Well," said Branuensteln, why do
you except certain forms of sport. Why
not proniblt poolselnng on contests be
tween prize fighters?"
"Because," replied Reed, "there will be
no restrictions if this bill Is not passed.
It Is a well-known fact that the greatest
evil results from indiscriminate gambling
on horse and dog racing. Homes are
rulnecl and crimes are committed through
Its influence. No one ever heard of a man
being ruined by betting on prize tights.
Chief of Police Sullivan intormed the
committee that the damage was done by
horse race betting. This ordinance will
correct two evils, and if the third Is bad
why you gentlemen have it in your power
to regulate it."
The Mayor here Interposed that the
danger in not adopting Keed"s order lay
in the possible opening of Ingleside, on
account of a technical error in the meas
ure now on the statute book. By adopt:
Ing the order it would fortify the old one
now in force and preclude the possibility
of opening the racetrack, with its attend
ant evils.
The vote on final passage was: Ayes â
Booth, Brandenstein, Comte, Connor,
Curtis, D'Ancona, Dwyer. Jennings, Ma
gulre and Reed; noesâ Boxton, Helms,
Hotallng, McCarthy and Tobln; absentâ
Duboce, Fontana and Sanderson.
The ordinance prohibiting the visiting
or poolrooms where gambling Is carried
on Dy poolselling on contests between
horses or dogs came up for reconsidera
tion, but Tobin stated that he had de
cided to withdraw his original motion to
reconsider and the Mayor declared the
ordinance lost. Comte contended that
Tobin had no right to withdraw his notice
to reconsider, and Tobln decided to make
his motion after all, but it was lost by a
vote of 8 to 7, ten votes being necessary
for adoption.
The ordinance prohibiting the sale of
parts mutuels, or betting on fractional
parts of boxing contests was lost, Booth.
Comte, D'Ancona, Jennings, Reed and
Tobln voting aye, and Boxton, Branden
stein, Connor. Curtis. Dwyer. Helms,
HotalinK and McCarthy voting against It.
Connor moved that the order be indefi
nitely postponed, as he considered that
the board should proceed slowly in the
matter of prohibiting gambling, but his
motion was lost. Brandenstein said that
gambling was a subject for elimination
and not for regulation. Reed stated that
the object of the ordinance was to put an
end to "fake" contests. He said that
betting on horse racing was an admitted
evil, whereas no one had ever been seri
ously damaged by betting on boxing con
tests, and the prohibition of paris mu
tuels would tend to elevate the sport.

lishers and printers of this city an oppor
tunity to be heard in opposition to the
proposed measure.
The bill appropriating the sum of $500
for the proper celebration of Memorial
Day was lir.ally passed, notwithstanding
the objection of Supervisor Brandenstein,

the treasury the expense should not be

take charge of the fund and he announc

The resolution dedicating a lot of land
on the westeriy line of Dewey boulevard
in the Alms-house tract as a site for the
ZCew City and County Hospital was post-
X>o!iÂ«rd for one week, until the views of
the Board of Health may be ascertained
regarding the best location for the In
stitution.
Supervisor D'Ancona explained that the
site nad been selected by the Hospital and
Health Committee on account of its fa
vorab.e climatic conditions. It was fairly
well protected by a hill and the drainage
va> ail thai could be desired.
Supervisor Maguire said the Mission had
been made a dumping ground for many
year? and It was time to call a halt. The
SdJstttoB had a hospital, pesthoupe and
railroad tracks and he asked that the
Hospital be removed.
Supervisor McCarthy argued that a
modern hospital was not dangerous to
public health, and that the proper place
ior fuch an Institution was in Its present
locality.
Supervisor Curtis said that the Mission
demar.ded the removal of the hospital and
ifce substitution of a park In its place.
Sui^rvisor D'Ancor.a agreed to a post
ponement, thouph he said the Health
Board already favored the Almshouse
tract.
Supervisor D f Ar.cona informed the board
that as chairman of the Hospital Commit
tee It was his duty to sign the demands
oa the City ar.d County Hospital. From
an Investigation of the bills submitted he
was satisfied that the contractors for
drugs were not furnishing the quality set j
forth in the contract. He was positive
that the drug? were being sold to the city
for less than cost and that inferior drugs
â¢were, therefore, being supplied. He men
tioned one Instance of "fluid extract,"
which was scheduled in the bid at J" 50,
when he knf-w that it could not be bought
for less than 115. Other instances had
ooire to his notice and he desired the
txmrd to tak*> some action to prevent ar.y
further fraud. The matter Â¦was referred
to the Judiciary Committee.
Miscellaneous Business.
The bide of the Evening Post and Bul
letin to print the delinquent tax roll at

were submitted and the contract was

The request of the Auditor that he be
allowed to appoint fifteen extra clerks
was referred to the Finance Committee
and the recommendation of Mayor Phe
j;tn that thirteen clerks be appointed was
later adopted.

AN ordinance Intended to remedy the faulty service given by the tele
phone company on party linos was Introduced by McCarthy at yester
day's meeting of the Board of Supervisors, and it was passed to print
without a dissenting voice. The ordinance provides that no person, firm
or corporation engaged in the business of supplying telephonic service to the
city or its inhabitants shall maintain more than five telephone instruments
upon any one party line. Violation of this- ordinance Is made punishable by a
fine of $100 or Imprisonment for 100 days, or both.
McCarthy addressed the board in favor of the ordinance, which, he held,
would result in an improvement over the present defective telephonic service.
He said that all legislation intended to bring the monopoly to a realizing sense
of the duty it owed to the community had proved somewhat abortive, and he
thought that the order presented would in a measure serve to correct some of
the abuses which hail crept in its administration of the valuable franchise,
for which it paid the city no corresponding return.
Brandcr^tein desired to know if the ordinance would not result In the
charge for party line telephones beinÂ« largely increased. McCarthy replied
that be did not think the company would resort to retaliatory measures after
the severe peering to which it had been subjected during the agitation against
itÂ« petty methods He remarked that the probable loss of subscribers by an
increased rate would deter it from any such action. His associates evidently
thought the same way. as they all voted for the ordinance.

Municipal Civil Service Commission
ers Expect to Furnish Business
Men With Employes.
A number of Inquiries have been made
recently of the Civil Service Commission
ers by business and professional men for
clerks, copyists and stenographers who
are on the municipality's eligible list.
Some time ago the business community
discovered that there was good material
to be had on these lists after the officials
had selected all required for the city's
work. The nature of the examinations
has been such as to determine the quali
fications of the applicants and it was rea
soned that if the latter were good enough
for the city they would be serviceable in
private business. Moreover, the matter
of character is also looked into by the
Commissioners. The latter are about to
issue the eligible list of typewriters and
stenographers â those who made the re
quired 75 per cent.
After the city's wants in these lines are
filled there will still be many capable per
sons who will be glad to secure positions
in private lines. A number have already
been called for. The examination for
clerks will take place on the 25th Inst.
and so far there are between 500 and GOO
applicants. Of these about 300 are ex
pected to make the required 75 per cent,
but the city will not require more than
100. The Commissioners believe that there
will be a big demand for clerks as soon
as the eligible list is made public.

CHICAGO, May 14.â Wheat gave evidence of
a firmer tone at the outset, opening a shade
up for July at 65};Â®65%c and advancing shortly
afterward to 66Â®664c. Around C6c the offer
ings, which had been small under that figure,
became more free and the price dropped back
to 66?ic. At this stage of the trade the news
of Influence consisted of higher cables, re
ports of backward crops In Germany and
France and frost In Austria, together with
domestic advices of flies in Illinois, dry
weather in the Northwest and chinch bugs in
Kansas. The reports of bugs' came In from
different sections during the whole session and
were a strong Influence In determining the
course of the market. The decrease in the
visible of 2,206,000 bushels was also a factor In
advancing the price of wheat.- and when July
again touched 66c holders still clung to their
lines and that market continued on Its up
ward course, touching 66%c. The close was
strong. July 4@Hc over Saturday at 66U<@6G%c.
Corn was a meek and lowly follower of
wheat, traveling a narrow path and exciting
little Interest. July closed unchanged at 37'4c
Trade In oats was mostly local and furnished
nothing of Interest or Importance. The close
was 4c up for July.
The provision market was quiet but strong
all day, helped by higher prices for hogs and
a good den.and for lard and ribs from packers.
July pork gained 5c, lard closed a shade up
and ribs closed 24c up.
The leading futures ranged as follows:

New York Stock Market.
XEXT TORK. May 14. â The price movement
in the etock market was extremely Irregular
and uncertain all day. The last prices of the
majority of stocks were higher than at Satur
day's close, but the best prices of the day
were nowhere maintained and th^re were wide
Inroads made in home of the Industrials and
epeclaJtles. The professional traders were In
clined to take a bearish view and came down
to the street this morning prepared to sell the
whole list. They were not deterred by the
evidences of strength in the London market,
which were due to the progress of General
Robert*" campaign and to the easier money
conditions. While selling the general list the
traders made fierce raids -upon the specialties.
Sugar. Metropolitan, People's Gas and Brook
lyn Transit were ail subject to raids and some
lost over 3 points. The bears found, however,
that the heavy offerings to liquidate which
were a feature of last week's market were not
forthcoming and they also found themselves
In a numerous company anxious to secure
stocks to cover short contracts. By bidding
against each other this company effected a
material rally in prices. They then paused
In some discouragement and confusion. Some
rather positive evidence of ftrength at dif
ferent points added to th*ir differences. There
was large buying of Burlington all day at an
extreme advance of over 2 points on renewed
rumors that a plan had been perfected to re
fund the consol bonds of 1*03. The movement
helped the whole granger group. The efforts
to bid up Missouri Pacific were resumed with
some success and Pacifies generally showed
good reco\-eries. The borrowing demand In the
Â¦tock loan department of the Stock Exchange
Indicated that the short interest had become
Bomewhat unwieldy and oversold. New York
Central advanced a point, but the Southern
group of trunk lines which have been In
fluenced by the Pennsylvania Company's ex
tensive operations for control were heavy- In
the late dealings, while the market was hang
ing In an unsteady condition at the high level,
the steel Industrials suddenly gave way all
roanfl. Federal Steel and Steel and Wire losing
S points and Tennessee Coal about 24. Other
members of the group showed smaller de
clines. The general list Â«rave way under the
Influence of this break and the close was ac
tive and weak with the gains largely reduced.
There was considerable activity in the bond
market, but the tone was irregular. Total
rales, par value. $1,280,000.
United States registered and new 4s declined
3 * in the bid price.

vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The markets here were firm during, the early
part of the session, the favorable i Influences
being the good news from Lord Roberts and
Genepal Buller and easier money. But the
public did not come In and the professionals In
their enthusiasm under the . spur of the dis
patch telling of the advance in Natal went
ahead too fast, precipitating a reaction and
caused an Irregular close. The settlements
showed only a trifling speculative commitment
Americens were abovÂ« parity all day and they
closed firm, although transactions in them
were at no time on a large scale. It is thought
here that the slump in these securities Is over,
although it Is believed they may continue
to drag. St.. Paul and Central Pacific - wert
scarce. The feature of the settlement was
the' heavy delivery of scrip by arbitrage
usur*rs. Tlntos broke 14 to 524 on the . fall
of 2f h in the metal, though they showed a
big bear account. The Bank of England bought
Â£88.000 gold in Germany and from Russia half

Mail advices from New York say: "The at
tempt to force sales of prunes by accepting re
ductions before placing them In cold storage
had the 1 - effect- of stimulating movement last
week, and the same influence is at work this
week. These sales are in small lots, rarely as
much as 200 boxes, and the desire of holders
Is to save storage expenses so far as possible.
Apricots are reported easier on a firm, offer,
and probably 7%c would buy now. Both prunes
and apricots are selling almost wholly from
second hands."

JuÂ£ge E. C. Hart of Sacramento haÂ»
overruled the demurrer of the defendant
to the complaint in the suit instituted by
the Contra Costa Water Company against
the city of Oakland Involving the validity
of the water rates established recently by ;
the City Council. In making the ruling a
lengthy opinion was filed on the subject
and also a formal order denying the mo
tion that the plaintiff be required to state
its several causes of action separately.
After reviewing the case In detail Jiidge
Hart states that upon presentation of the
motion he was disposed to regard some of
the points made by the defendant as pos
sessing much force, but that on caretully
examining the complaint and comparing
It with the one which was sustained In
the case of the Spring Valley Water
Works vs. the city and county of San
Francisco he found it followed subetan
tially the language and averments used
In that action.
"That being so," reads the decision, "It
would be decidedly presumptuous upon
my part to undertake to substitute my
judgment as to the sufficiency of the com
{)laint for that of the highest court in the
and. Holding the view that the conten
tion urged on the motion to strike out
certain parts of plaintiff's pleading is, in
the light refleclHl upon the decision to
which I have Just reierred. untenable. It
therefore beeomts unnecessary at this
time to enter upon any discussion of or
attempt to determine the question, to my
mind one oT the most important presented,
as to what constitutes the measure or
basic elements of compensation upon
which the Council Is, under the law, au
thorized to act In nxlng the maximum
rates to be charged for water. This ques
tion will necessarily be presented upon
the trial of the cause and may then be
passed upon and determined so far as
this court is concerned."
Regarding the petition to strike out the
allegation that no notice had been given
the water company by the Council of its
Intended action in fixing the rates on the
ground that such notice is not required.
Ju4se Hart holds that while such action
may not be necessary, a neglect of this
precaution, unexplained, when the fixing
of the rates was in contemplation may
be a circumstance tending In a greater or
less degree to establish the fact that the
body acted arbitrarily and without inves
tigation.
The contention of City Attorney Dow
that inasmuch as Mayor Snow signed tho
ordinance he should have been made a
party to the suit Is disposed of by refer
ring to the decision of the Supreme Court
In the case of Jacobs vs. the City and
County of San Francipco. (100 Cal.. page
--4, et seq.i. From this case is deduced
Ui* opinion that It Is not necessary for
the Mayor to be made a party to the suit.
It was urged In the demurrer that as
the waur company will receive an an
nual profit of W5.000 under the rates fixed
by the Council, the complaint fails to
a cause of action. Judge Hart
finds that the authorities do not sustain
this contention: that the point to be con
sidered Is whether the company will re
ceive a just compensation, based upon the
amount It has invested
Accordingly the motion to strike out in
oenled, tho demurrer overruled and thÂ»Â«
defendants piven ten days in which to fllo
an answer to the complaint.

The engine was running tender on draw

coaches. The train had left the Alameda
depot at 4:30, connecting with the 4:15
boat from San Francisco, ana It was Just
about 5 o'clock when the accident hap
pened. The tender left the track first and
went bumping along over the ties. En

that the engine might gro over at any mo

to stop the train and prevent a loss of life

due the fact that no one In the coaches

ANOTHER engine turned turtle this
afternoon on the Alameda narrow
gauge line and wrecked a train
on the big curve at the land-end of

of this nature that have happened on the
mole, the engine turned over, the train
behind it was derailed and the occupants
of the engine cab were severely Injured.

dent." said Engineer French. "We were
running slowly â In fact, slower than us

us and we are under orders to allow
plenty of freeway. Nothing alarming
happened until we were on the last curve
toward the roundhouse. A sudden jar of
the tender, followed by the crashing of
the ties under our wheels, told me that
the engine had left the track. Deter
mined to prevent a disaster, I sprang to
the lever and applied tne" brakes. Then
I reversed the lever, throwing the steam
on hard. To add to the ordinary diffi
culties of such a position, the lever did
not catch securely on the ratchet and
slipped. The heavy iron struck me a hard
blow on the right leg, nearly knocking me
down.
The wreck delayed the travel upon the

system, but did not entirely stop it.

Fireman Elliott was injured. He was

No one seems able to explain the cause
of this wreck, but as It occurred upon

it happened to one of the big engines

plausible theory Is that the tender struck
a soft place In the roadbed and was de

\ Frightful Disaster Averted by
the Prompt Action of the
Engineer.
Fireman May Lose His Life, but His Partner
in the Cab Escapes With Slight
Injury.
OAKLAND, May I4.r-Rev. Barton "W.
Perry, for many years pastor of the
S;m I^andro Presbyterian Church
and later private secretary to Con
gressman Metealf, has received his com
mission as a chaplain in the United Stales
regular army and will sail Wednesday on
the transport Logar. for Manila. He is
under orders to report to Major General
MacArthyr for assignment for duty..
Rev. Barton W. Perry Is one of the best
known of the Presbyterian ministers in
California, where he has always taken a
prominent part In the affairs of the de
nomination. He is a graduate of Hamilton
College, New York, the same Institution
from which Secretary of War 'Root grad
uated. His theological course was taken
at the Auburn Theological Seminary. His
tlrst charge was in Rochester, N. Y. Here
it was that Mr. Perry built his first
church. .The lots upon which it was con
structed were given bv Colonel Elwell S.
Otis, the returning Military Governor of
the Philippine Islands.
In 1S93 Mr. Perry came to California and
was for the better part of a year pastor
of the Redding Presbyterian church. For
two years be was the editor of the Occi
dent, the organ of the denomination.
Later he assumed charge of the San Le
andro church, where he was located for
six years. While in San Leandro Mr.
Perry took a prominent part in the mate
rial affairs of the town and had much to
do with the raising of a $5000 subsidy for
the establishment of the cannery In that
town. During his term of service he
doubled the size of his church and built
an addition and man??.
In 1896 Mr. Perry was one of the dele
gates to the Pan-Presbyterian Council
held at Glasgow, Scotland. He rode 10X>
miles upon his wheel through Great Brit
ain studying the cathedrals. In 1898' he
was commlslsoner from the Oakland Pres
bytery to the General Assembly, and at
that session held the position of chairman
of the committee on church erection.
There are but eight chairmanships In the

the purpose of finally passing the bond
ordinance, to which no opposition was
expected. City Attorney Taylor, who pre
pared the ordinance, was present and
read the document, explaining it as he
went along. At the portion stating the
need of a new library building it was set
forth that there were 7000 people who en
joyed the privileges of the library.
This statement brought Trustee Mackie
to his feet with the remark that It wa3
false; that the library had but 5100 mem
bers. There was no reason, he said, why
the facts should be distorted, and If they
were in one case other points were open
to attack. The Trustee then openly de
clared his intention to vote agains"t the
final passage of the ordinance.
Mackle's stand aroused the Ire of Chair
man Brick, who said that he could see
no valid reason for haggling over figures,
especially as Trustee Mackie had all along
been on the side of those favorable to
the bond issue.
V. hen the matter was submitted the or
dinance was defeated by the- votes ot
Trustees Mackie and Schulte. Trustees
Brick. Miller and Forderer voted aye. A
two-thirds vote being necessary, the two
contrary Trustees defeated. the project.
Some excitement was caused after the
rollcall by Chairman Brick, who sought
out Mackte and stated his displeasure at
what he termed the latter's backsliding.
Mackie did not reply.
According to the ordinance submitted
this evening it was proposed to bond the
city for $1(6.000, with interest at 4 per cent.

ALLIANCE CLUB, TO
OPEN THE CAMPAIGN
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, May 14.
The Citizens' Committee of One Hun
dred, which has been considering the
question of bonding the city for improve
ments, finally submitted Its report to the
Council this evening. The report was full
of surprises, and the Council will con
sider it at a future meeting.
Perhaps the greatest surprise in the re
port was the section in regard to sewers.
The committee found the" necessity of
many sewer Improvements, the recon
struction of the main lake sewer and pro
viding for storm and sanitary sewers in
Cemetery Creek, East Oakland .and the
annexed district, but they reported
against bonds being issued by the city for
these improvements and in favor of the
work being done by the district assess
ment plan.
"Your committee carefully considered
the various engineering plans for perfect
ing our sewer system, but finally came to
the conclusion that as all sewer Improve
ments had heretofore been made in Oak
land under the district plan, the parties
specially benefited paying therefor, it
would not be advisable for this commit
tee to propose to the city or to the Coun
cil so radical a change as Imposing the
charge for constructing the main sewers
upon the city at large. Your committee,
as citizens and taxpayers of Oakland, are
not opposed to such a change being made,
but, if it were recommended by us, it
would arouse antagonism, and we are not
sufficiently impressed with the necessity
of the change to urge it upon our fellow
citizens. We therefore do not report in
favor of borrowing money by the city for
the purpose of making sewer improve
ments, but recommend proper action be
taken by the Council for the purpose of
causing these improvements to be made
at the expense of the districts benefited."
Upon the question of bonds for a water
supply the committee recommended "that
no bond proposition for a supply of fresh
water from wells be submitted to the vote
of the people until a sufficient supply of
good water is located by satisfactory
tests. If at any time In the future a sup
ply of pure, fresh water can be furnished
the city from mountain lakes or streams
it will be time enough to consider the Is
suance of bond3 therefor, when it can.be
shown that a sufficient supply at a rea
sonable cost can be obtained.
"It has already, been reported to the
City Council," says the report, "that
a plant for furnishing a supply of
salt, water, to be used in sprinkling the
streets, may be obtained for $31,348, and
we unite with the sub-committee in rec
ommending the issuance of bonds for that
purpose." â¢ â¢
Bonds for fire department improvements
were recommended to. the amount of $57,
500, as follows: Firehouse and lot in Lynn
district,, East Oakland. $3000; same in Aid
en, annexed district. $12,500: same in Gold

clear Harbor recommendations were in
definite. No recommendation was made
in regard to dredging upon the ground
that this was a function of the Federal

madefor wharves at West Oakland upon

OAKLAND, May 14.â In view of the liti
gation now pending over the water rates
recently established by the City Council
a communication received to-day by the
Supervisors, petitioning that body to re
duce the water rates of a certain district
to the figures decided upon by the city
of Oakland, was not directly acted upon,
but referred to the committee of the
whole. The residents making the petition
live between Oakland and San Leandro
and outside, of- incorporated cities and
towns. Among the more prominent sign
ers were the following:
SUBURBAN RESIDENTS
WANT CHEAPER WATER
OAKLAND, May 14.â The sight of a yel
low flag displayed this morning at the res
idence of A. Solomon, 1401 Eighth avenue,
threw the residents of that vicinity Into a
state of keen excitement. Inquiry discov
ered that young Herbert H. Solomon, a
clerk in the employ of the Pacific Mail
Steamship Company, had been stricken
with smallpox.
Young Solomon has felt badly for sev
eral days, and this morning Dr. \V. S.
Porter was summoned to attend him. Pro
nouncing it a case of smallpox the physi
cian Immediately took steps for the isola
tion of the patient. The matter was re
ported to the health office and the em
ployes of that department summoned the
younger children of the , family from
school and placarded the house.
The supposition is that Solomon con.
traded the disease by handling the mail
and advices from China. Dr. Porter re
gards his chances for recovery as excel
lent.

Alameda County is having lots of trouble
with the State government. This county
was picked as the first upon which the
experiment of returning partly cured in
sane was to be tried, and now all of the
money that is due the county by the State
Is held up.
The money received from the State for
the support of indlgsnts and half-orphans
is apportioned to the: hospital fund of the
county. When the State falls to make its
payments promptly it leaves the, hospital
fund short. The county now has $17,500
due it, and this claim has been allowed by
the Board of Examiners at Sacramento,
but the money has not arrived. The mat
ter was brought up before the Supervisors
to-day, and Supervisor Church and Dis
trict Attorney. Allen were instructed to go
to Sacramento and make an investigation
as to why the money Is not sent.
Alameda County Is facing a shortage in
its hospital fund because the county is
unable to get $17.&C0 due from the State for
the support of indigents and half-orphans.
There is already a shortage of $10,000 in
this fund and claims are being held daily
because the money due the county cannot
be collected. .

J. D. MORTIMER MADE
MEDALIST OF CLASS
Since James R. Whlpple, last year's
football captain, was prevented from
playing in the Indian game because his
record in studies was^below. the mark set
for athletes considerable discussion has
been Indulged in on the subject. At this
morning's meeting the senate decided that
athletes need not have any higher rank
than any other student who was allowed
to remain in college.
Another Important action taken was the
gauging of marks given the students.
Hereafter any 6tudent who does not aver
age at least five hours of twos and ones
each term will be dropped from trie uni
versity rolls. At the expiration of six
months, however, if he has made up his
work he will be reinstated. This rule ad
mits of no change by any professor or
body. It will greatly increase the stand
ard of scholarship. â'Â¦
The third change was in doing away
with all special examinations. When a
student cuts an examination he cannot
now get a special examination from some
indulgent professor, but must wait until
tho beginning of the next term, when the
regular examinations are held, when he
may apply for and take an examination.
Professor George C. Edwards was made
faculty member of the student executive
committee. John R. Glascock was made
alumni representative of the student exec
utive committee.
BERKELEY, May 14.â Three Important
changes were made In the administration
rules of the University of California at
the meeting of the academic senate this
morning. The ancient law that required
an athlete to have a higher standard in
his studies than ajiy other student was
repealed.
No Longer Required to Attain Higher
Percentage Than Their Fellow
Students â Special Exam
inations Barred.

â¢'As to giving General Miles rank as a
lieutenant general, he said that a major
general commanded a division, and he did
not know of another country in the world
with a large army that gave the com
manding officer of the whole army a rank
below lieutenant general, or that did not
recognize that he should outrank a divi
sion commanaer. As to the adjutant gen
eral, he said that all European armies
recognized the importance of the position
as the center of military administration
and gave rank accordingly. He thought
the provision for this increased rank
should be general and not apply only to
General Corbin. though the latter's ser
vices the past two years merited especial
recognition.
WASHINGTON*. May 14. â Secretary
Root to-day explained to the House Mili
tary Committee the advantages that
would accrue from the passage of the
army reorganization bill. He dealt espe
cially on the proposed increase of the ar
tillery arm, and the increased rank given
Generals Miles and Corbin. He said that
the effect of the bill was to increase the
army 5000 or 6000. entirely in the artillery,
this Increase extending over a period of
years. While differing from the provision
originally recommended, Secretary Root
approved the Senate amendment, as It
would permit the War Department to go
to worn and put the artillery in shape.
The situation now, In caring for seacoast
fortifications, was just as foolish and im
practicable, the Secretary said, as that
would be of a man who built a fine house,
equipped in the most perfect manner, and
then went away and left it to take care
of itself. There are millions and millions
invested In fortifications, he said, with no
one to take care of them, involving de
preciation from lack of attention.
Declares That an Increase in the Ar
tillery Force Is Absolutely Nec
. essary in Order to Man
Coast Defenses.

pears Before Committee
of the House.

desiring to give him the glad hand, cor
dially greeted him with:
"Hello, Curtis, how are you?"
Curtis drew himself up and said: "I
don't wish to talk with you. sir. You in
sulted me from the bench two weeks ago,
and I don't want to have anything to do
with you."
The Judge calmly replied: ""Whatever I
may say from the bench I stand responsi
ble for as a man."
Curtis lost control of his temper and
shouted: "You are a blackguard, sir!"
"Time!" yelled some one. and two fists
shot out. Curtis' fist grazed the point of
the Judge's nose. The Judge landed
short. They clinched and the same voice
yelled, "Break away!" There were sev
eral spectators of the fight, among them
Officer McMurray of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children. As the
Judge and attorney swayed to and fro
Officer McMurray separated them forci-
bly. This ended the hostilities for tha
time being.
"This man Curtis," said the Judge, "la
enough to irritate anybody. He asks so
many unnecessary questions when exam
ining a witness, and i3 constantly putting
in a reminder that he practiced before the
United States Supreme Court. I possibly
should not have lost my temper two weeks
ago and said what I did. When I met
him at noon I was willing to apologize to
him if I had hurt his feelings. That was
why I spoke to him. But I could not stand
being called a blackguard."
Curtis is a scion of a well-known Mary
land family. He Is the grandson of an
admiral, nephew of an Associate Justice
of the United States Supreme Court who
gave the dissenting opinion in the cele
brated Dred Scott case, that practically
led to he civil war. and was formerly law

The United States Supreme Court
yesterday decided in favor of the Stato
a long contested suit of the Atlantic and
Pacinc Railroad, Involving in part the
right of tho State Board of Equalization
to assess railroad rolling stock operated
in this State, although claimed to be
owned elsewhere.
The case is one of vast importance to
California, and has been fought for
seven years through the Federal courts
in this State, and to the highest tribunal
in the land.
Dispatches received yesterday from
Washington announce that Justice Har
lan handed down, the opinion of the Su
preme Court ln the case of C..W. Smith,
receiver of the, Atlantic and Paclllc Hail
road Company, vs. Truman H. Reeves,
Treasurer of the State of California, af
firming the ueciKion of the court below ln
favor of the State.
In behalf of the State the argument was
made several weeks ago before the
United States Supreme Court by State
Attorney General Tirey I,. Ford and Dep
uty Attorney General William M. Abbott.
The suit was over $3000 in taxes paid by
the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad under
protect levied on an assessment by the
State Board of Equalization ln 1833 on
certain rolling stock operated by the com
pany on Its leased tracks from Needles
to Mojave.
In explanation of tho case last night
Attorney General Ford said:
"The railroad Hrst brought suit in the
Lnlted States Circuit Court, before
Judge McKenna. claiming that the
State Board of Equalization had no right
to assess the rolling stock, tho company
asserting that It had been assessed In
New Mexico, hence the California board's
action would be a double assessment.
The stock Included all cars and engines
operated over the then leased line of the
Atlantic and Pacific,' covering 2*3 milea.

Interesting Programme Last Night
for the Entertainment of the
Teachers' Club.
At the regular monthly meeting of thÂ«
Teachers' Club held last night at the
Mercantile Library there were some inter
esting talks about trips abroad made by
inf-mber? of the club at various times.
Silas A. White told of a five months' trip
h<? had made through Norway, Sweden
I>r.mark, Iceland. Hebrides, Russia,
Prussia and the Netherlands. He had ex
cellent opportunities for observing the
people and their customs and had the fac
ulty of telling in an entertaining way just
what he had seen.
Perry P. Tompklns described a trip
through Europe on a bicycle and told of
many interesting things, tie had seen from
that point of vl*>w, which a traveler by
rail wr-uld naturally miss.
Possibly the most Interesting and in
structive talk of the evening was given
by Mr*. K. M. North, who has been
"across the pond" several times and has
had time and opportunity of making a
study of the public schools of the Conti
nent. Hhe ppoke particularly last night of
the methods of teaching geojrraphy in the

A Hohenzollern: Superstition.
Apropos of the superstitions of the Ho
henzollernsâ superstitions, by the way,
found in all ancient royal families, in
cluding our ownâ the rulers of that house
possess a talisman brought . Into it by a
good spirit said to guard their destinies.
This is the curious "black stone," to
which Â¦ is attached the following quaint
tradition:
Since tbe time of the Elector John
Cicero, who flourished toward the end of
the fifteenth century, each ruler has been
wont, before his death, to hand to his
successor a scaed packet. This contains a
rinK. In which 1m s*et a black stone said
to have been dropped by a huge toad on
the coverlet of a princess of the familv
just as she had given birth to a son.
l'rederlck the Great found the ring in a
cover, which also closed a memorandum
written by Frederick I, stating Its value
and its mode of transmission. Schneider
the librarian of William I, declares that
he saw the packet handed by Gelling, the
treasurer, to his royal master on his ac
cession, and further , asserts that he read
his account of the talisman to the Em
peror, who "fully confirmed it.
The present Emperor never fails to wear
on all great ocasions this queer old ring
and has, like every Hohenzollern, the
deepest respect for the quaint little Jewel.
Frederick the Great's father had the black
stone mounted on a ring and bequeathed
It to his son, who " believed firmly In Its
value as a talisman, and many of the doc
uments of that time deposited In the ar
chives at Berlin make allusion to it-

was denied. Nevertheless there are men
who were serving as guards at that time
who declare that Mrs. Botkln went out
"to the dentist's" no less than five times
and all on the orglnal order, which was
intended for but one trip. In each of
these excursions, it is charged, she was
accompanied by McFarland, the assistant
superintendent.
Mrs. Botkin has a room by herself at
the jailâ not a common room, but one well
furnished; one that belonged to one of the
matrons when the jail had room for two
matrons. She has her meals served in
her own room and there is no lock to it
except that upon the inside. She may keep
her light burning as long as she pleases
she may receive what visitors she pleases
and altogether the free and easy way in
which Mrs. Botkin lives the life of a life
convict has before now caused a scandal
that has brought no credit with it. Guards
and officers have been in trouble for be
ing too friendly and too willing to show
courtesies and there is every prospect that
more trouble of the same kind is immi
nent.

Judge Cook is expected back from San.

of the wanderings of Mrs. Botkin. At
any rate he says he will start his investi
gation as soon as he returns from the
country.
Mrs. Botkin has been a disturbing ele
ment at the branch Jail ever since she
was sentenced to life Imprisonment. She
used to pester Sheriff Martin with ro
quests for privileges until in the extrem

JUDGES Gilbert. Ross and Morrow
of the United States Circuit Court
of Appeals handed down a number
of decisions yesterday, the most In
teresting and Important of which was
that by Judge Ross in the case of C. J.
and L. E. Hanchett, appellants, vs. John
Chiatovlch.
Chiatovlch is a wholesale and retail
merchant in the town of Silver Peak, Es
meralda County, Nevada. The Hanchetts
employ about fifty men m the same town.
For some reason not material to the is
sue. Chiatovich Incurred the displeasure
of the Hanchetts and they showed their
disapproval by posting bills around the
town threatening their employes with dis
charge should they continue to buy mer
chandise from . him. The merchant re
sisted the boycott by filing suit in a Fed
eral Court and obtaining an injunction
and damages. From the judgment of the
Federal Court in Nevada an appeal was
taken.
Judge Ross affirmed the judgment of
the lower court, Judges Gilbert and Mor
row concurring. Judge Ross' opinion of
the boycott is expressed in the opinion
which follows:
"It is contended that one man has a
legal right maliciously - to interfere with
the business of another. We deny the
soundness of any such proposition. No
one can properly deny to any man the
absolute right to cease dealing and to
refuse to have business or other relations
with any particular person or persons,
but no man. In our opinion, has a legal
or, moral right through malice, ill-will or
revenge to command other persons to do
so. â¢ â¢ ? Perhaps in the case of the
large majority of men the pursuit of hap
piness involves the pursuit of business en
terprises of one kind or another. With

"It Is, in our judgment, a clear viola
tion of the right appertaining to every
person engaged in an industrial enter
prise, for another person, through malice
or revenge, to command or Induce other
persons to withdraw or withhold their
custom from him, or otherwise malicious
ly interfere with his business."
The other decisions were as follows:
what show of reason or justice can It be
said that this right lawfully to pursue
his own business can be legally interfered
with by third parties, except by competi
tion?
The Judge and the Prisoner.
}> â EITHER Mrs. Botkin has a double.
, and several who have every reason
,1 j to know the woman sentenced to life
imprisonment have run against it,
cr. the prison guards and the Sheriff to
the contrary, the prisoner has been enjoy
ing the free air of the peninsula whenever
Fhe pleases.
Judge Cook swears he saw her on the
Guerrero-street car with a man who he is
generous enougrh to be certain was no
one but a guard from the Jail. She was
tried before Judge Cook, and for weeks
she sat face to face with him. Her fea
ture? must have been Impressed upon his
memory when he sentenced her to Impris
onment for life. It is considered hardly
possible that Judge Cook could have made
any mistake in so important a matter.
But Judge Cook is not the only one.
There are at least two ex-employes of the
Sheriffs office whu are sure they saw
herâ one about two weeks ago on Mar
ket street, near Kearny. and the other
about six; weeks ago. also on Market
etreet. between Fifth and Sixth. On the
first occasion there seemed to be no one
with her. On the other she was with a
nan whose most prominent feature was a
sandy mustache. It was reported that a
third man Â»=aw her entering the Parrott
building, some months ago.
There is no one at the Branch County
Jail who will admit that Mrs. Botkin was
evor allowed outside of the prison walls
ThÂ»Â»y have even made affidavits to that
effect, but mtm Judge Cook Is unsatisfied
and is going to make an investigation on
his own account. Sheriff Lackmann has
Fignifiod his pleasure at the intention of
the Judge and has promised to assist In
every way. He wrote the following to
Judge Cook yesterday:

FEDERAL COURT
CONDEMNS BOYCOTT
PRICES FOR OLD MASTERS.
Very Few Paintings Which Have
Reached Four Figures.
Since the Dudley sale of 1S92 no really
choice collection of old masters has come
under the hammer in this country, and
the prices paid for the few isolated exam
ples which have been offered for sale
would seem to indicate that the taste for
this class of composition Is not what it
once was. This is perhaps inconclusive
evidence as to a decline in taste, for an
indifferent specimen gains as largely by
being sold in such a collection as the Dud
ley as It loses by being sandwiched be
tween a medley of the old and the new.
Very few of the old masters have dur
ing 189S reached four figures. The most
important of all was the splendid Rem
brandt portrait of Nicholas Huts, which in
the Huston sale brought 5000 guineas, or
3000 guineas more than were realized at
theÂ» Adrian Hope sale four vears before.
A Rubens. "Repose of the Holy Family,"
on June 25, sold for 1300 guineas. Sir
John Mlllais' poetical example of Van
Dyck,"Tlme Clipping the Wings of Love,"
sold for S40 guineas, or nearly four times
the price at which it was acquired at the
Blenheim sale in 1SS5; but the fact that it
was a great favorite of the late P. R. A..
i and that it was accompanied by a sort of
j written guarantee from his hand, gave it
â¢ an Interest and importance which it
mlght-not otherwise have had.
The Ruston sale included an example of
Van Dyck. also from the Blenheim collec
tion, a "Virgin Child," which sold for
1000 guineas, or just double the amount
it fetched In 1S66. There were also two
Van Dycks In the highly Interesting series
of family portraits from Hilton Hall (sold
June 25), formerly the residence of Joseph
Addlson and his wife," the Countess of
Warwickâ these portraits are said to have
been brouKht to Bllton Hall from Holland
House â and these were whole lengths of
Prince Rupert and Prince Maurice, his
younger brother, and they realized 720
guineas and DSO guineas respectively.â

PKOmSSORY NOTE OF 1781.
Uncle Sam Failed to Pay It and the
Interest Now Amounts to $13,000.
The War Department has received a
communication from Norman Stearns of
706 Washington street, Dorchester, Mass.,
in regard to a claim against the Govern
ment which has Interesting features. Mr.
Stearns says that he holds a promissory
note of the United States Government for
$18 67, payable to his great grandfather,
Eli Stearns, given in 1781, and never paid.
The note bears date of August 1. 1781. and
Is signed by "Tim" Pickering â the abbre
viation In - Mr. Stearns' letter â quarter
master general, and countersigned by
"Jabbery Hatch, D. QAM." Mr. Stearns
says that the money was advanced to the
corps of Invalids at Boston and quotes the
phraseology of the note as follows:
Â¦ "Said sum shall be paid on first day of
November next ensuing (1781), and if not
then paid the came shall bear interest of
6 per cent per annum until paid."
' If the Government pays the note Mr.
Stearns will receive more than $13,000, be

FOR the past two weeks the relations
between Judge Cabanlss and Attor
ney George F. Curtis have been
strained. Curtis was defending a
woman charged with disturbing the peace
before the Judge, and demanded a jury
trial.' This Incensed the Judge, as It puts
the court and citizens' who act as jurors
to unnecessary trouble and expense, and
he dismissed the case, remarking to the
defendant:

GREAT VICTORY
SCORED FOR THE
PACIFIC COAST
Jobbers of the Middle We3t
Cleverly Checkmated at
Boston.
Indorsement of National Association
of Manufacturers in Its Efforts
to Obtain Graded Bates
Fails. .
Secretary Thomas P. Smjth of the Pa
cific Coast Jobbers' and Manufacturers'
Association returned from the East yes
terday and brought news that mad.e the
officers and executive committee of the
association congratulate themselves upon
their foresight In having a delegation
representing the Pacific Coast at the an
nual meeting at Boston of the National
Association of the Manufacturers of the
United States. Had the Pacific Coast been
unrepresented the St. Louis jobbers were
prepared to secure the adoption of reso
lutions that would, practically have sus
tained their entire contention concerning
freight rates to the Pacific Coast as set
up in the famous suit now pending before
the Interstate Commerce Commission.
There was a very good chance that the
resolutions might have been adopted on
an ex parte hearing. The Pacific Coast
representatives were informed of the dan
ger and at once upon their arrival at
Boston went to work to head oft the
scheme of the Middle West jobbers. They
succeeded in showing the manufacturers
on the Atlantic seaboard that they were
concerned equally with the Pacific Coast
In the maintenance of the present condi
tions, as the Institution of graded rates
would make the Atlantic coast and the
Pacific Coast the farthest removed points,
commercially considered, on the continent.
When the facts became generally known
the arguments of St. Louis, that had been
received In certain quarters with some fa
vor, lost their edge and the little joker
was exposed. There is a large manufac
turing Interest in the lUddle West that
is allied with the jobbing interests of that
section and the Western manufacturers
were numerous in the convention. On
the other hand there was only one Pacific
Coast manufacturing: plant represented â
the beet sugar factory at Chino. The At
lantic seaboard manufacturers were not
slow to take the alarm and as a result
the St. Louis resolutions never had a
chance. Â¦
After the convention adjourned the rep
resentatives of the Pacific Coast talked
with many manufacturers who do busi
ness on the Atlantic seaboard and found
them, when they fully understood the
matter, strongly favorable to the mainte
nance of the present system of rate
making.
