Lord's Doings in Nevada.
RENO, Nev.. April IS.â Earl Russell, son
of John Russell, once Prime Minister of
England and a descendant of the Duke of
Bedford, has been masquerading about
Reno and along the shores of Lake Tahoe
a good part of the past year under the
guise of "J. F. Russell." He has been ac
companied by a woman going under the
name of Mollle Cooke and a young man,
said to be her son. but who turns out to
be Stanley Watson. At the Riverside Ho
tel, In Reno, about a year ago. Earl Rus
sell and Mollie Cooke first made their ap
pearance here, and by their mode of liv
ing left the impression that they were
husband and wife, that is. they occupied
room's together, smoked cigarettes to
gether and altogether acted as husband
and wife. " Later report 3 reached here
from Glenbrook that they had rented a
cottage on the shores of Lake Tahoe and
were there keeping house under the same
relationship. Still later they appeared in
Reno accompanied by a young man, said
to be the son of Mollle Cooke. Finally
they arrived here Sunday last and asked
George Cheek, the "Marriage Bureau"
clerk at the Riverside, if they could be
married without a license. On being in
formed that it would be a penitentiary
offense they procured a license and sum
moned Judge Curler of the Second Dis
trict Nevada Court, and in the presence
of George W. Cheek, the hotel clerk, and
Stanley Watson, the alleged son of Mol
lie Cooke, were married in the parlors of
the Riverside Hotel.
As Seen Smoking Together.
As seen smoking cigarettes with Earl
Russell on the lawn at the Riverside Hotel
about a year ago Mollle Cooke was buxom,
dark and forty, and from her features as
well as bearing â¢ appeared amply able to
take care of herself. As compared with her
liege lord she is small of stature,, but
compactly if not stoutly built. .With
coarse, sharp-cut features, black hair and
dark eyes, her jaw, chin and reliant bear
ing in particular would- give one _the- in*
presslon that she would make a mighty
poor clinging vine to almost any 'massive
oak. Earl Russell would do for the oak.
He is tall, of reddish complexion, coarse
featured and has that gawkish, lounging
appearance and gait that we associate
with certain Englishmen- in this country.
With his outing costume, leggings, pipe
and cap, taken In connection with a cer
tain superiority of manner, he attracted
attention and naturally suggested British
nobility. In their conversations here they
"flocked by themselves," and no inkling
of the real identity of any of them ever
leaked out.
There is absolutely nothing known here
of the past history of 'Mollle Cooke,
though it had been surmised that she
came from Ireland. Earl Ru?sell regis
tered at the Riverside as "J. F. Russell
and party." He signed the marriage cer
tificate as "John Francis Stanley Russell
of London, England," married to "Mollie
Cooke of London. England."

PRINCIPALS IN A BUSINESS DEAL THAT ONE REGRETS.
mAX KERSHAW. a young man
frcm Philadelphia, with a pen
chant for French restaurants
and the cocktail route, and a fre
quent visitor at the Cliff House, is looking
for one Jule C. Gamage, another young
man about town. In order to hag his
game Kershaw has employed an attorney
and the Pir.kertcn Detective Agency.
Kershaw doesn't ask for muchâ only about
J6700 worth of good, negotiable raiiroaJ
stock, which In a moment of effervescent
confidence he took from his inside pocket
and gave Gamage to dispose of in tht
New York market. The winsome Gam
age is now in New York playing the role
of a man of wealth. Kershaw is holding
forth at a French restaurant in th!s city,
blaspheming his own easy disposition and
vociferously damping the day he met the
quiet, smooth-faced and oily tongued
Gamage.
Gamage. who is employed by the Hard
ing Collection Agency, has been a familiar
figure in the cafes and public places of
this city, being usually identified by his
clothes, which were of the passionate va
riety.
Kershaw Had Money to Burn.
For more than a year Max Kershaw
has been in this city, and he calls it "lit
tle Paris." His home is in Philadelphia,
where the stone gathers the moss, and
the change from the peaceful life of that
great city to the swirling, fierce, "fizz"
existence of San Francisco has been his
financial undoing. Every month Kershaw
received a fat package of currency from
his uncle, J. Henry Kershaw, and from
his brother in Philadelphia, both of whom
are men of wealth and of prominent social
position. Max v/as always on the line, his
pockets heavy with clinking gold and with
an ever-ready hand to spend it. But lately
the money went "out of the exchequer
faster than it came in. One year of con
sistent remitting exhausted the patience
and generosity of uncle and brother, and
Max Kershaw was left without ready
cash.
As a safeguard and a last resource in
time of need the young Philadelphian al
ways carried on his person several thou
sand dollars' worth of railroad stock.
Gamage found this out. and now he has
the stock and Kershaw- is using every
means to recover It. He claims that his
good nuture, hla kindness of heart and his
dire distress were all instrumental in
drawing the railroad securities away from
him and placing them in the hands of
Gamage. Besides obtaining possession of
the stock Gamage secured from Kershaw
a general power of attorney to do as ho
saw flt with all his possessions.
The power of attorney was secured by
J E. Shaln, who acted for Gamage. and
forwarded It to the latter in New York
City. >:Â¦;â¢
Gamage Is in New York.
Gamage has been located in New York,
and he will be soon forced by legal pro
cess to deliver the stock in his possession,
if he has not disposed of it. The power of
attorney was revoked yesterday.
Kershaw. a graduate of Yale, has trav
eled from one end of the world to the
other, dipping into the pleasures of life
with abandon and utter lack of restraint.
In Denver he owns property worth thou
sands of dollars, but it is tied up in an
estate and he could- not use the income
as he 'desired. In this city he associated
with all the young men from the East
who have good connections and periodic
remittances. One of this class was Mor
gan Smith, who enjoys the reputation of
having squandered a fortune on the track
and following the rapid road to ruin.
Smith is a nephew of J. Pierpont Morgan
of â¢Â¦Â¦ New 'Â¦ York. His sudden dash and
splurge In this community is a thing of
the immediate past, and he is at present a
rounder who has run bis course.
"Smith told Gamage Â¦ all about .my
stock," says Kershaw, "else he would
cot have known about it. I waa strap?ea
and bauiy in want of money. Snutn
knew of the stock and my condition, ana
1 am positive he informed Gamage t>:
both. At any rate Gamage cane to ms
and agreed to get me JlOuO on the bonds
representing $30w of stock."
Parted With His Bonds.
Kershaw had in his possession threo
bonds of the Vincennes and Indianapolis
Kallroad, each valued at $1000, also three
bonds of the Philadelphia ami Reading
Railroad, which agg.Vgated in value JSTOif.
With ail this convertible property about
his clothes Kershaw could see neither the
sense nor the reason of going thirsty for
a bottle of champagne or hungry for
frogs, saute, etc.. so he listened to the
proposals of Gamage.
The deal was this: The collector of bail
debts was to receive 3 per cent for nego
tiating the sale of the tonds. Gamage
realized that a trip East, where the bontia
were quoted, might be palmed off en
young Kershaw. and the suggestion fol
lowed the thought. As evidence of good
faith he gave Kershaw CX> and received
the bond*. The COO came from JakÂ«
Raver. who loaned Garnage - H*.*) for a
single night and charged him for the us.?
of it the small sum of SZi). which is 172 i
per cent per annum. Rut what did Gam
age care? The next day he went to the
Crocker-Woolwortli Bank with the Vin
.cennes and Ir.dianapoiis .bond 3 anil
borrowed $1000 at a reasonable rat a
of interest, depositing the bonds as se
curity. Raver was paid that day. In or
der to get a quotation on the bends Gam
age. agreed to pay Jack Welch $100.
Money was no object to the collector.
Takes a Whirl in Chicago.
Kershaw with his S3OO was thoroughly
comerit with himself and liked thÂ«
smooth-faced, check-suited broker. On
April 5 Gamage separated himself from
this city, bound to the far East. At Den
ver, where the real property of Kershaw
is situated. Gamage stopped off for a
time. Chicago was to his liking and he
"did" that city in genuine free-handed
fashion. Then came New York. Gamago
is not yet finished with the great metrop
olis.
From New York came all manner ol
wild tales about the collector. He repre
sented himself as an attorney with rail
road bonds from a reluctant holder who
wanted to sell. The Waidorf-Astolia was
selected by him as his nocturnal resting
place. Wine, women and horses helpe-l
consume hl3 time. Bell, the fashionable
New York tailor, is fitting him out In new
checks. He was on Wall street and of
fered the information that he owned Vin
cennes and IndianapolL* stock, but that as
he was not In want of money he wouM
hold it for a rise. When he grows 3ated

akin to the truth. Gamage will then gÂ»
to Philadelphia. Baltimore and Washing

In the East. After that will come a Euro
pean trip for an Indefinite period. At
feast, that 13 what Gamage says:
KeTshaw Has an Awakening.
Jnst such a time as Gaaa?e has bÂ«Â»n
Indulging in In New York Kershaw hs.3
been naving at this end of the continent.
Women and wine ana a reckless disre
gard for the cost have paralyzed the JSOO
and row Kershaw k* thinking until the
perspirntlon is streaming from his brain.
When he discovered what he had done h*
wired his relatives in Philadelphia, ami
they engaged the Pinkerton Deteetivo
Agency and an attorney for the young
Gamage is still in New York. Wherever
he goes in his incandescent wanderings as
he plays the butterfly of fashion and thÂ«
torrid "tenderloin pattern, the shadow o?
a detective is upon him. What final ac
tion will be taken by young Kershaw i 3
yet unknown.

WASHINGTON, April 18.â In further re
sponse to the Senate resolution of January
17 last the President to-day sent to the
Senate additional documents bearing upon
t the insurrection in the Philippines. The
papers are all important. One of them is
a report of Colonel Aramas Blanco of the
:Philippine army to the "general com
manding, the zone," of the events
of February 2. 1899, in Tondo. He says
that on hearing' the alarm of fire he im
mediately ordered twenty men who gath
ered to hold themselves ready "so that
when the designated, hour arrived they
Would be ready to go to Meislc, where the
American barracks are, and set on fire
the houses about there in order to inter
fere with their coming out of the bar
racks, as was agreed upop in the meeting
with Drosend Lonvn. The result was
that on marching to the scene of opera
tions we found the calzadala of Azcaraga
was I * filled' with Americans and with them
were a number of country people, who
cried out. 'Brothers, to the strife, for now
is the hour!' This is what men were say
ing to that crowd and at the proper time
they sounded the call of our army, 'Ad
vance and fire!' The sight of that strange
scene threw us into confusion, for we be
lieved that- all we had prepared from the
beginning as well as what we saw was
prepared by the enemy and his spies."
He then ordered a retreat, and when
they met the Americans, the colonel says,
the latter gave, his forces two volleys. He
adds that his men with their daggers in
a hand-to-hand conflict forced the Ameri
cans to retire.
Another letter, dated at Tarlac, October
23 last, signed by J. M. Lebab, commands
an unknown Filipino officer, who. the
writer says, "will go to Manila commis
sioned by our Government to throw some
dynamite bombs and set fire J;o the houses
and the principal buildings, especially
those occupied by foreigners."
Overtures to Spaniards.
Among other documents is an unsigned
letter to General Rios of the Spanish
army, and in command at Iloilo, dated at
Malolos, October 25, 1898, apparently in
spired by Aguinaldo. In this letter the
writer says that his desire is to "yet save
from shipwreck the of Spain
in these islands." He then proceeds:
I am Informed that you are considering sur
rendering the place to us or to the Americans.
After six months of vigorous siege and of total
abandonment I understand how you can pre
fer us to the others. The way to make this
surrender Is to Join us and proclaim the feder
ation of the Filipino republic with the Spanish
republic, recognizing the chleftanshlp of our
honorable President, Senor Emllio Aguinaldo;
a fraternal embrace will take place between
Filipinos. Vizayana and Spaniards. There will
be hurrahs for Spain and the Filipinos united
as a federal republic; your troops will pass In
to the co imon army; you will be promoted to
a lieutenant general. Those who want can go
back at our expense and the - flags of Spain
and the Filipinos will float side by side. You
will give an account of this to Madrid and in
the meantime we shall fight the Americans to

NOT IN FAVOR
OF CHANGING
MINING LAWS
Hansbrough's Amendment to
Alaskan Bill Opposed by
Senators.
Nelson Denounces the Nome Law
and Order League as an Or
ganization of Claim
>
WASHINGTON, April 18.â During al
most the entire session of the Senate to
day the Alaskan Civil Code bill was under
consideration. In this connection Stewart
of Nevada delivered an address of nearly
throe hours upon the mining laws of the
United States and their relation to the
proposed amendment of Hansbrough as to
the rights of the locators of claims. Nel
son of Minnesota, Carter of Montana and
Teller of Colorado discussed the pending
amendment at length, both Nelson and
Teller being particularly vigorous in de
nunciation of it.
Hale reported from the Committee on
Naval Affairs a joint resolution .drawn
originally by Mason of Illinois, authoriz
ing the Secretary of the Navy to have
struck bronze medals for distribution
among certain officers and men ot the
North Atlantic Squadron commemorating
the naval engagements between the forces
of Spain and the United States in the wa
ters of the West Indies and the Cuban
coast. The measure, which appropriates
$25,000, was adopted,
A resolution was offered by Hoar, di
recting the Secretary of War to tell the
Senate how many lnmateÃ of the National
Soldiers' Homes were colored men or In
dians. In explanation Hoar said that it
was his desire simply to ascertain whether
there are a sufficient number of colored
inmates of such homes to warrant a sep
arate institution. Pettus of Alabama
asked that similar data concerning the
national asylums for the Insane be asked
for by the resolution. This was agreed to
and the resolution was passed.
A concurrent resolution offered by Fos
ter of Washington, directing the Secretary
of War to have a survey made of the
mouth of the Nooksachk River, was
passed. -;-,;_/ v
Inquiry as to War Tax Revenue.
Gallinger of Ohio offered a resolution
calling on the Secretary, of the Treasury
for the aggregate amount of revenue de
rived from the tax on notes, bank checks,
insurance policies, leases, mortgages, tele
grams, express shipments and medical
preparations. Several suggestions were
made to include other articles on which
there is a revenue tax. Platt of Connecti
cut suggested that the information asked
for ougnt to cover the operation of the
entire war revenue act. After some dis
cussion the resolution went over.
A bill providing that the State of Wy
oming be permitted to relinquish to the
United States certain lands heretofore se
lected and to select other lands from the
public domain was passed.
An effort was made by Money of Mis
sissippi and several of his Democratic col
leagues to obtain consideration of the bill
to revive and amend an act to provide
for the collection of abandoned property
and the prevention of frauds in insurrec
tionary districts within the United States,
and acts amendatory thereof. Strong op
position to the bill developed on the part
of Hale of Maine. Chandler of New Hamp
shire, Warren of Wyoming, and others.
Hale declared that: the bill. If -passed;
would subject the United States. treasury
to a drain of probably $150,000,000. Money
challenged Hale's statement, . saying that
the bill would take no. such amount from
the treasury: that it involved;only:ss,ooo,
000,' and that a trust*fund," for. which the
measure provided, was the means Â¦Â¦ of 'dis-Â»
tribution to its proper owners. :Â¦ â¢ Â¦
Teller, of Colorado,: as a friend of the
bill, urged Money not to press 'the meas
ure at this time, ac come further Informa
tion was needed by the Senate before it
acted upon the- bill. 'The â¢bill* needed
amendment, he; said, Â» but he thought it
would be passed without serious delay.
when understood by the Senate. Money
gave notice that he would call up the
bill next. Wednesday.
Stewart Be views Mining Laws.
The Senate then resumed consideration
of the Alaskan Civil Code bill, Stewart
addressing theÂ« Senate on the pending
Hansbroush amendment, speaking in op
position to any change in the mining laws
of the United States. Stewart reviewed
the mining laws of the Strte to the extent
that they related to alien's rights" in the
Alaskan gold fields. He defended the
rights, of the Laplanders. Swedes and Nor
wegians who had entered mining claims
in the Cape Nome district.
Nelson followed Stewart, also sustain
ing the rights of the so-called aliens who
had located the mining claims In question.
Hansbrough interrupted Nelson to read a
paragraph from a document drawn by
the Law and Order League of the Cape
Nome district, which declared- that the
people who," Nelson said, had located the
claims were not really the locators of the
claims.
In reply Nelson said that the time had
come to call things by their, correct
names. He derfounced the "Law and Or
der League" as an organization formed
to jump claims located by honest pros
pectors.
Continuing, Nelson said the claim own
ers in the Cape Nome district were all
declared citizens of the United States, or
people who had honestly Intended to be
come citizens of the United States. He
declared there was no reason in equity,
justice or common sense why any dis
crimination-should be made against the
Swedes, jNorweglans and Laplanders.
ThÂ« "Law and Order League," he said,
had attempted to drive these people from
the Cape Nome district and had been pre
vented doing so only by the United States
military, forces. As a result, the league
had asked the removal of the commander
of the United States troops in that dis
trict. The proposition, reduced to its ulti
mate analysis, was simply one to fortify
claim jumpers as they had never before
been fortified. '
Tillman of South Carolina agreed with
Nelson in what he had said of the rights
of the Swedes. Norwegians. Laplanders'
and Finns, and, speaking of the Hans
brough amendment, said that "Senators
ought to take It by the nape of the neck
and kick it out of the Senate."
Carter and Teller Clash.
Carter of Montana made an earnest and
forceful appeal to the Senate that the
American minerâ either native born or
properly, naturalizedâ should have the first
claims upon the mining land of the United
States. He said in the course of his re
marks that he had no desire to change
the mining laws, but intimated that Tel
ler of Colorado and others were trying
to change them. In a heated reply. Tel
ler declared that Carter "under a pre
tended zeal for the American miners" had
attempted to shift upon him the responsi
bility of a desire 'to change the mining
laws of the United States.
"I resent the statement," interjected
Carter, and was about to explain further
when Teller declined, to yield.
The Colorado Senator said that. nobody
had proposed any change of the mining
laws except Hansbrough and Carter, who
by their proposed explanation were pro
tecting the scallawags and scoundrels and
SACRAMENTO, April IS.-The First
Congregational Church never looked
more beautiful than it did to-night
on the occasion of the wedding of
William L. Dierssen and Miss Fran
ces B. Xourse. The floral wealth of Sac
ramento was called into requisition in or
der to adorn the church and the rarest
of roses were twined about in long ropes
and gathered in the center from the four
corners of the sanctuary. Six hundred
invitations had been issued and the re
sponses showed the high estimation in
which the young couple are held. It was
essentially a "pink wedding," and as such
was one of the most attractive ever wit
nessed here. The ceremony was performed
by Rev. J. B. Silcox, pastor of the church.
The young couple were attended by Miss
Rebe Nourse, sister' of the bride, as
bridesmaid, and Richard E. Dierwsen.
brother of the groom, as groomsman. The
maids of honor were Miss Adelaide Diers
sen, Miss Laura Dierssen, Miss Ruby
Cooper and Miss Sydina Barnard of San
Francisco. The ushers were Edward Rob-
inson, Halsey G. Smith. Frederick Blanch
ard and William Qutnton.
The bride is the daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. G. F. Nourse of Sacramento. She
is an accomplished singer, having been
under the tuition of the famous Clara
Munger of Boston, and having studied ex
tensively in Eastern academies. Her voice
is a mezzo soprano of rare sweetness.
Mr. Dierssen is the eldest son of D. Diers
sen. a leading merchant, and is associated
with his father. The bride's dress was
an exquisite creation. The skirt was
plain, with long court train, finished
around the bottom with heavy cable cord.
The corsage was high, embroidered in a
pansy pattern, with sea pearls. The
sleeves were mousquetalre. finished at tho
hand with pearl trimmings. Around the
yoke was drawn a fichu of chiffon, which
was finished at the ends with a fringe of
sea pearls. The wedding veil was fas
tened to the coiffure by a spray of orange
blossoms. She carried a bouquet of brides
roses tied with tulle. The drosses of the
bridesmaid and maids of honor were of
pink. Mr. and Mrs". Dierssen, after their
honeymoon trip, will occupy their own
home in this city. ' . .

Both the preceding document and the
one immediately following were on paper
used in the private office of Aguinaldo,
but neither of them bore any signature.
The second document in this connection,
whtch is not dated, is apparently a letter
of instruction to the Filipino Commission
ers who were to accompany the American
troops to Iloilo. They were told not to
recognize the sovereignty of the American
Government and upon disembarking the
commissioners .were to prepare the Fili
pino forces to attack the Spaniards "some
hours before the Americans can enter the
place." They are told that in case either
the Spaniards or the Americans want to
treat and make promises to "believe noth
ing and pay attention to nothing:, but
press the attack until you die or con
quer both of them." If the attack should
not take place until after the entry of thÂ»
Americans the Filipinos were instructed
that they must "continue to enter the
city, preparing to occupy and taking pos
session of the ground, but without firing
a shot unless the Americans commence."
In case the Americans should begin tho
Filipinos were to attack immediately and
not to give up until killed.
Discounts American Valor.
In this connection the Iloiloana were
assured that the Americans were valorous
only in appearance and would soon yield
if met by valor. If the Filipinos should
get possession of Hollo before the disem
barkation of the Americans then the Fili
pinos were to "conceal themselves well
In order to deceive the Americans and
make them think we are more than we
are in fact. In this," the Instruction con
tinues, "let them appear and when they
are in due range of our rifles there should
be a general discharge, so that as many
men as possible will be killed at one.
We can calculate one of our soldiers be
ing worth four of theirs, so that In the
hour of victory after the combat we
should have less losses than theirs."
Another document relates to the con
ference sought by General Otis with Fili
pino leaders relative to the expedition to
Iloilo and says that General Otis tried
to secure a deputation of natives to ac
company the expedition in order to con
ciliate the insurgents there. There Is a'
note with this document saying that Gen
eral Otis had indicated that it was the
purpose of the United States to annex, the
Philippines, but that the general admitted
that there were two parties In the Senate.
A proclamation signed by Aguinaldo on
the 24th of May. IS9B, says:
I see the firanlsh Government is arable to
struggle with certain elements which coni>tant
ly oppose the progress of this country, and now
flnce the powerful and great North American
nation ha* come showing a disinterested pro
tection which will enable us to secure the lib
erty of this country, I come to assume the
command of all forces, ready to assure the
attainment of our revived aspirations.
He said he would first establish a dic
tatorship and afterward a government
with a cabinet.

PARTISAN STRIFE
IN LOWER HOUSE
Politics Creeps in During the Dis
cussion of the Naval Appro
priation Bill.
Â»
Grosvenor in a Defense of tbe President In
curs the Anger of Williams of
Mississippi.
WASHINGTON, April IS.â The debate
en the naval appropriation bill .under, the
five-minute rule to-day drifted .into poli
tics, and for a good portion of the after
;.r;on members fought hammer and tongs
across the political aisle. The partisan
rancor almost culminated In a sensational
scene between Grosvenor of Ohio, the
champion of the administration, and Will
iam? of Mississippi. Some of the Demo
crats began worrying Hawley of Texas by
pointedly asking if tho President had not
chanced his mind on the Porto Kican
tariff question, and Grosvenor finally
threw himself into the breach. Williams
made an interruption that drew a sharp
rejoinder from the Ohionn about the "un
fair" advantage taken by the MissSsslp
pian. This aroused the wrath of the lat
ter, and after Grosvenor had concluded
he made a stinging response, in which he
paid parliamentary language would not
permit him properly to characterize Gros
venor's offense. Later Grosvenor dis
claimed Intentional affront and there the
matter ended.
Some progress was made with the bill.
but most of the controverted points went
over. A motion to strike from the biil the
contingent fund of $300,000 for the Navy
Department was defeated. A point of or
der against the aporopriatlon of $330,000
for the new Naval Academy at Annapolis
was pendinjr vrhen the House adjourned.
Kitchen ot \*orth Carolina, a member
of the Xava' emmittee, made a point of
order agairst the provision in the bin apÂ»
propriatirg $300,000 to be expended under
the direction of the President to meet un
foreseen contingencies.
Foss argued th:it the appropriation was
In crdcr for the general provision for the
maintenance of the navy. As a general
principle, Foss said, he would not advo
cate so large a contingency appropriation,
but he thought present circumstances
warranted it. Kitchen said that if Will
iam J. Bryan were in the executive man
pion to-day r.ot a member on the other
Fide would lxÂ» willing to place J500.000 at
his disposal for use in his discretion. It
vas bad policy and bad precedent.
Politics Creeps In.
During Fr-.nje remarks by Hawley of
Texas in euiogy of the President's course
Kitchen asked him if the President had
rot denied that the constitution, the
greatest of all blessings, followed the flag.
"That is a technical question," replied
Hawley.
"In order not to embarrass the gentle
xrsan I withdraw the question," observed
Kitchen, amid laughter.
Later Hawley challenged Wheeler cf
Kentucky to give the name of the officer
of the United States v.hor- he yesterday
â¢ xpressed the opinion was responsible for
the armor-plate trust. Whet lor replied
that he had expressed that opinion, but
be did not giv<* the name of the officer
vhorn he had in mind.
Later on Grosvenor of Ohio and Wil
liams of Mississippi became involved in
Â« sharp controversy. Williams quoted an
{Â¦Hoped Interview with the president of a
Western university, in which, speak'ng of
the President's position or. the Porto Ri
can bill, he said that while it might be
jrorer to Fpeak of Peel and Gladstone
having change;! their minds on public
*>uoF'!ons. it wor.ld be more precise to say
that President McK^r.ley "had oermlUed
his mind to be changed for him." (Laugh
ter and applause on the Democratic side.)
"Does not the gentleman know that the
purported interview was utterly repudi
ated by its alleged author?" asked Groe
venor.
"The gentleman dors not know it. but
If it was repudiated, the anecdote Is true
en my own responsibility." replied Wil
liams, who proceeded to ask whether It
tvns true that the President had changed
fcis mind on the Pnrto Rican question.
There was considerable fencing. Wheeler
ct Kentucky taking n hand. At last Orcs
ver.or made an allusion to Williams'
method of lnterrunting him. which the
Intter resented with an emphasis that
portended a personal ouarrel on th<? floor.
rut Williams finally allowed Grosvenor to
proceed, reserving his reply until the
Ohioan had finished.
"Poos the ger.tleman deny that the
President has ctiaxuced h's mind?" asked
Kitchen (D.) of New York, addressing
Grosvenor.
Grosvenor Defends the President.
"As soon as it became manifest to the
ProFidfnt that monf-y had to be raised in
ffitne way and that the Ways and Means
Committee cf thif House had brought in
a tariff bill providing for 15 per cent or 23
T'-r cent." replied Grosvenor, "tbe Presi
dent recognized thft right and power of
this House to originate that tariff bill. Up
to the very last moment of the passage
cf that Porto R!can bill gentleman on the
either sirte insisted that the Pr^si^ont was
Ftill in favor of free Jrade in P< > Rico,
nnd newspapers from one end of this con
tinent to thf other claimed that we. on
this side of th<* Hrufe. were in a contest
with the President: that the President
rever had changed his mind: that he was
Ftill In favor of free trade. But I call the
pentl^man's attention to the fact that in
tbe message of the President he gave no
f;ign or indication of when he desired that
that free-trade measure should go Into
effect. We by our vote put it so that
â¢within the next sixty days, ninety days.
four monthsâ any time after the organiza
tion of the civil Governmentâ the people
cf Porto Kico can have free trade. The
President has signed it and thereby given
his approval to it."
"The gentleman says the President bows
to the will of Congress." interposed
Wheeler. "In the debate on the Porto
Kican question, when the gentleman ap-
pealed to his colleagues to support the
pending bill, he charged It to be true that
the President cf the United States was
then In accord with him."
Groirvenorâ l cay so now.
- Wheelerâ He changed his opinion . ""â¢-,
Grosvenorâ I say he did not chance his
opinion in any material respect: he simply
chanped from the original Idea of free trade
to what was almost the condition of free trade
that we appended to the measure. The country
understands it. Congressman after Conirrees
rr.an who stood here in defense of the bill has
pone to his constituents Just when the Demo
cratio noise was the loudest and has been
rent back here with a unanimity almost unpar
eHeled In the nomination of Congressmen. And
the great bofly at Philadelphia, the Manufae-
turers' Association, yesterday approved of
the Porto lUran bill, the very body that a few
weoks ajto was quoted on this floor as opposed
to it. (Applause on the Republican side.) And
fi-om one -end of this country to the other the
people cf tbis country are taking care of it.
Tbe Republican party will not lose any votes
ia t!i<> cominjr election because of its action on
the I'orto lllcan bill. We are not holding back
Â¦by: the coattatls of the world and holler
ing "When"; we hnve got something to show
for our opinions. Witness the splendid organl
xatltn of the new government of the Hawaiian
territory. Look ct the liberal, penerous. Chris
tian laws that we have bestowed upon the peo
ple of Porto tiico. I^xik at the fact that but
fur the intervention of a few men on this side
cf tbe water we should have extended the same
benefits of the constitution, the same liberty
of American citizenship, in embryo, at least to
the people of the Philippine Islands. Dut we
wr^jld not consent that you should drive us to
adtrit that the people of Porto Rico and the
perple of the Philippine Islands were upon an
equal footing with the people In the United
States. We would not consent that millions
of Malnye and all those people might
come ever here and march Into our labor mar
kets, and we will make it warm for you be
fore the campaign is over. (Laughter and ap
rlaufe on the Republican side.) You voted
that the constitution carried equal citizenship
to the Malays and the Chinese of the Philip
pine Islands and that is your position to-day.
It is yrur complaint that we would not let you
do it. but in due time, under the wisdom of the
ICc-rubUean narty and under the blesÃinsrs of
God. we will send liberty and equal rights as
rapidly as thoy can comprehend them to the
!Â»K>ple of Porto Rico and to the people of the
Philippine Islands.
Williams' Bitter Reply.
When Grosvenor took his seat Williams
demanded an opportunity to reply and
time was accorded him. Speaking with
deliberation he said:
Mr. Chairman: As a man stows old he
learns something. I have learned something to
day. 1 will not acain, while a member of the
American Congxers, undertake to aÂ«k a ques
tion ct any member on this -floor who is not
sufficiently "well versed in the ordinary cour
tesies of human intercourse to be capable of re
turning at leatt a polite reply to a polite
inquiry. Further than that It would be al
most Impossible for me without a breach of
rarllamentary rule to express myself upon
that partlcula- subject. I asked the gentleman
?rr,m Ohio a question which he either could not
answer or would not nnswer. or. in his usual
Â¦lawyer-Ilkc politician style, desired to evade.
That question ha* not k'n answered yet. The
eentleman said on this floor that the Presi
dent of the United States has not changed his
rrln3 upon the Porto Rlcan question. Remem
ber. I did not make the charge that he had.
What I charred was that he had permitted
ethers to change his mind for him, which in my
opinion was not a th'.nr of which any man
could at any time be proud. But in charity to
the President and In charity to many of the
members of this House. I asked the g-entleman
when lie denied that the President had chanced
his mind that he permit me to a*k a question
and he yielded. I ceked him whether the
Pr?fldent had not in a public messace an
nounced that he was in favor of free trade be
tween Porto Rico nnd the balance of the
t'r.ltod States and also whether various mem
bers .>f tMs House had not risen one after
another to cay that the President had told thÂ»m
in private conversations that he was at the ttm*
of the conversations in favor of the bill which
passed the House. There way nothing rude
in that inquiry: there was nothing personal in
it: then? tvas noth?nr discourteous in it: there
was nothir* unprecedented in it: there was
rothlns In it that could have stirred up wrath
in the breast of any men except one who felt
as If he had to break up the convention in a
row in order to keep from arrivln* at an elec
tion. That is all. (Democratic applause.)
Grosveror. disclaimed any Intention of
affronting Williams and there the matter
ended.
Kitchen's amendment was lost.
When the provision relating to the ap
propriation of $100,000 for ocean and lake
Furveyn was reported Moody of Massa
chusetts reserved a point of order against
It and by agreement debate on the section
went over until to-morrow.
Cannon of Illinois made a point of order

Imprisoned Chinaman Im
plicates Himself and
Two Others.
Jail at Steveston Surrounded by Jap
anese Who Wished to Lynch the
Men Held as Accessories
to the Crime. '
Sr>eclal Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER, B. C, April 18.â Eight
Chinese are now in the provincial jail at
New Westminster charged with the mur
der of Alexander Main, the Chief of Police
of Steveston, or with -being accessory to
the crime. Main had been missing three
d.'iys and yesterday his mutilated and dis
membered remains were found in a fresh
ly made grave near a group of shatks oc
1 cupied by Chinese market gardeners. So
i bitter was the feeling in the town of
1 Steveston against the prisoners that dur
ing the night several hundred Japanese
' surrounded the Steveston police station,
Intent upon lynching the Chinese prison
ers but the officers managed to take the
Chinese in safety to Westminster, eight
miles distant. -
One of the prisoners, Chan Yee Chung,
to-day confessed to the murder, stating
! that Yip Lick, a highbinder, had ordered
1 the assault upon Main, but that the mur-
I dered officer had first been struck on the
head from behind with a club wielded by
I a third Chinese, who has fled and who has
I not yet been captured. The club, with its
iron hook, was found to-day near the
cabin, covered with blood, arid â¢ a long
knife was also found with traces of blood
upon its blade.
From Chung's confessions, aided by evi
dence developed by the detectives, it is
now believed that when Chief Main at
tempted to arrest the Chinese for the
theft of the stolen goods found ln their
shack he was killed with the club and
knife, being repeatedly stabbed and
Chopped with the hooked tool. The re
mains were temporarily hidden, fires were
started where there were blood stains and
even Main's dog was killed In a vain at
tempt to avert suspicion.
I At night the body was taken from Its
temporary hiding place to be permanently
buried in a little round hole dug In the
beach. The body was chopped into small
pieces, but the hole had not been dug
deep enough and Jt could hardly hold the
parcel of butchered flesh.

NEW YORK, April 18.â Joseph H. Man
ley of Maine, who Is one of the members
of the Republican National Committee
deputized to look after arrangements for
the Republican National Con% r ention at
Philadelphia, was at the Fifth Avenue
Hotel last night. He said the Philadel
phlans were making fair progress In the
alterations to the convention hall and had
raised the money pledged by the citizens'
committee. Mr. Manley was asked who,
In his opinion, would be nominated for
Vice President.
"My impression," replied Mr. Manley,
"was that It would be a New York man.
But that has now been- changed. The
action of your State convention yesterday
would indicate that the New York Repub
licans do not want the Vice Presidency.
If that be the case I think the nomina
tion will bo to some Western man â and
the farther West he is the better it will
be. There has been some talk of Secre
tary Long, and Mr. Long probably would
accept; but there is no doubt about New
England, and I think the disposition is to
take a candidate from some section that
is fighting ground." t

Do You Realize the Danger You Are In?
Pain or dull ache in the back is un-
mistakable evidence of kidney tr-cuble.
It is nature's timely warning to show
you that the track of health is not clear.
If these danger signals are unheeded
more serious results are sure to follow:
Bright's Disease, which Is the worst
form of kidney trouble, may steal upon
you.
The mild and the extraordinary effect
of the world-famous kidney remedy,
Swamp-Root, is soon realized. It stands
the highest for its wonderful cures of
the most distressing cases. A trial will
convince any one â and you may have a
sample bottle for the asking.
Lame back is only one symptom of
kidney trouble â one of many. Other
symptoms showing that you need
Swamp-Root are, obliged to pass water
often during the day and to get up
many times at night, smarting or irri-
tation in passing, brickdust or sediment
in the urine, catarrh of the bladder,
constant headache* dizziness, sleepless-
ness, nervousness, irregular heart beat-
ing, rheumatism, bloating, irritability,
worn-out feeling, lack of ambition, loss
of flesh or sallow complexion.
If your water when allowed to remain
undisturbed in a glass or bottle for
twenty-four hours forms a sediment or
settling or has a cloudy appearance it
did during the days when General Sher
man, General Grant, President Hayes and
other distinguished men were entertained
there.
The same massive furniture remains;
the same pictures look down from the
silent walls; the same sorrow seems to
brood over everything, as it has from the
day when the Senator and his wife, filled
with memories of departed tenants,
turned away from the abode and visited
it no more except in Imagination. But
the memories were all tender ones, and
Mrs. Stanford would have preferred that
the old mansion should have crumbled to
decay rather than that its history should
be profaned.
Mrs. Stanford has planned some im
provements which Bishop - Grace will
carry out prior to the opening of the in
stitution. The .home and grounds, how
ever, are in perfect condition and the
premises are most attractive. Mrs. Stan
ford a few years ago gave evidence of
her interest in the Catholic church here
by presenting to the Bishop a magnificent
picture of the Madonna, copied by per
mission of the Emperor of Austria from
the original one of the old masters, in
the Royal Gallery. The painting to-day
occupies the most prominent wall space
in the cathedral.
INITIAL STEPS
FOR FORMING A
FARMERS' TRUST
New Organization "Will Be
Known as the Knights
of the Soil.
Instead of Devoting Its Time to a
Discussion of Political Issues
It Will Be a Business
Union.
â¢
Sr-eclal DiF^atch to The Call.
TOPEKA. Kans., April 18.â The prelim
inary steps toward the organization of
a gifrar.tic farmers' trust to embrace all
of the- fanning communities of the Mis
sissippi Valley were taken at Abiline,
Kans., last night. The new association
will be known as Knights of the Soil, and
Is designed to take the place of the Farm
ers' Alliance, which has long since be
come * extinguished. This organization will
cifT'-r from its predecessor in respect to
the object eought to be obtained in effect
ing ihv.- organization.
Instead ot devoting its time and energies
to a discussion and attempt at settlement
of the political questions of the day this
association will be a business union of
the farmers, its chief object being to
enable the farmers to hold their grain and
produce during times of low prices with
out paying interest on a loan. The trust's
secondary objects are much like those of
t!:e alliance, in that it aims to improve
the farmer's social condition and furnish
him information relative to the world's
visible supply of grain, the condition of
crops in various sections and other infor
mation of like character, similar to that
furnished by the United States Depart
ment of Agriculture.
,B. H. Barnes, formerly of Dcs Moinet-,
lowa, is chief promoter of the new trust.
The idea of forming it was suggested to
h:rs by the combinations being effected
In all other lines of business. He already
has 1200 applications for membership in
the organization. Mr. Barr.es proposes to
organize a grand lodge, with local lodges
In all of the farming communities. He
::. - the following explanation of the
plan of the association:
"The chief idea cf the organization is
to rive the farmers a chance to hold their
crops without paying Interest. When a
iv.'.tnher needs a little money to tide him
ovÂ« r for a time he makes his application
to h:s= local lodge and if it is a growing
cr-'i> that he has as security a committee
of three members examine it and make a
report to the lodge. The lodge lets him
have the money or as much of it as is
Bute on the crop and he pays no interest.
s . -r. when he sells the stuff he pays
into the treasury of his lodge s^>er cent
< : what be made by holding it. It costÂ»
iim rattling to hold his grain and if a
icerted movement of this kind is made
there will be no great rush of gTain to
cwrki-t. causing prices to drop. If wheat
n worth Uu cents when he gets his loan
i :: advances to 60 cents while he Is
dng it he pays to the lodge 5 per cent
f the profits he has made by holding it.
Thia fund is then used to loan to others
::. like circumstances."
and complained of being hard up and
sought to borrow money from me. 1
knew he had wealthy relatives in Phila
delphia, in some way connected with the
Knickerbocker Ice Company and that
J. Henry Kershaw of Philadelphia is his
uncle. 1 also knew that in August young
Kershaw will receive about $250, CW0 from
an estate. I insisted upon having security
before loaning him money and he pro
duced three bonds of the Indianapolis and
Vineennes Kail road and some stock of the
Philadelphia and Reading- road, supposed
to be worth about $2>X>o. He could not ne
gotiate these securities, so I, in my ca
pacity of attorney and agent, did so for
him at the Crocker-Woolworth Bank. The
paper was Reading stork. I received some
cash, balance to be paid me on my arrival
in New York. I handed Kershaw $500 and
he wanted me to use this money in dis
charging obligations he owed to women.
I then departed for the East, with the in
tention of visiting New York. Philadel
fhia, Boston. Baltimore and Washington,
n Boston and Washington I have rela

AMERICA NOT
TO MAKE WAR
UPON TURKEY
. . .
Next Step in the Controversy
With the Sultan Will
Be Peaceful.
This Government Will Convey Its
Indignation at the Sublime
* Porte's Betrayal of
onuses.
WASHINGTON, April 18.-The news of
the firm attitude assumed by the State
Department toward the Turkish Govern
ment in the prosecution of its claim for
damages to American missionary prop
erty caused something of a sensation in
diplomatic circles to-day. Three succes
sive American Ministers have' prosecuted
these claims; each received a promise of
prompt settlement and yet not a dollar
has been paid. "With European diplomats
that is an old experience, and they have
consequently been somewhat surprised at
the announcement that the United States
Government is actually going to insist
upon performance instead of promise.
Minister Angell, after trying his hand at
collection for two years, recommended
that a United States warship be sent to
seize Smyrna and collect revenues at the
custom house thr-re sufficient to meet our
claims. This suggestion was not seriously
entertained, nor is it now. In the first
place, according to the State Department
ofllcials, the most important business in
terests in Smyrna are in the hands of for
eigners, not Turks, and a bombardment
by a United States fleet might result In a
pretty bill for damages against us. Then
as there is still a remnant of a Turkish
navy, the United States would have to
send a squadron instead of a single ship
Such a movement would without doubht
be resented by the remainder of Europe
which could not contemplate with equa
nimity any action by the United States
that would perhaps destroy the fruits of
many years' work of the great European
statesmen by precipitating a final crisis in
Turkey.
Therefore the next step to be taken by
our Government will not be warlike, but
will suggest in a most dignified manner
the indignation felt by the United States
at the betrayal of Turkish promises. How
this attitude will bear upon the Turkish
Minister in Washington cannot be fore
told at this moment. He has so far ab
solutely been unentangled in the negotia
tions, but that fact might not save him
from being made the immediate victim of
his country's laches. The Minister, how
ever, is very popular in Washington.
"LET HIM REMEMBER SPAIN."

LONDON, April 19.â The Vienna corre
spondent of the Times says:
"By further resistance to the claims of
the United States the Sultan will expose
himself to grave consequences which ne
probably had not foreseen. The United
States Government is not accustomed to
indulge in empty threats. If the Sultan'
for a moment supposed that he would find
protection from any European power let
him remember Spain."

GIVES WARNING
TO DEMOCRACY
Appeals Against Abandoning
the Traditions of the
Party.
Declares That Victory Is Impossible
While Jeffersonian Principles
Are Put Into the Back
ground.
NEW YORK, April 18.â The Brooklyn
Democratic Club gave a dinner to-night
at the Germanla Club to commemorate
the one . hundred and fifty-seventh anni
versary of the birth of Thomas Jefferson.
About 150 persons were present. At the
guests' table were ex-Governor James E.
Campbell of Ohio, Joseph J. Willett of
Alabama and other prominent public
men.
Former President Grover Cleveland sent
a letter regretting his inability to be pres
ent and. expressing his opinions on the
present Democracy. The letter was as
follows:
.PRINCETON, N. J., April 11.
Louis F. Buchardâ l>ear Sir: I regret that 1
am unable to accept your invitation to attend
the dinner to be given by the Brooklyn Demo
cratic Club on the l'ith inst. to commemorate
the birth of Thomas Jefferson.
When those who profess the Democratic faith
meet to celebrate the birth of the man who
tirFt gave them faith in a distinct formulation,
their pride in the achievements and triumphs
of the party which he founded should not en
tirely displace all thought of present situations
and the conditions which, in the light of ex
perience, appear to be essential to its success.
Though the faults of the party in power are
many, and though its offenses against the po
litical health and safety of the country are
flagrant, these things should not encourage us
to base an expectation of success and a hope
for the restoration of wholesome administration
upon the shortcomings of our adversaries.
We should too well understand their ability
to attach to their fortunes tha powerful con
tingent of selfish interests, to place confident
reliance upon the weakness which ought to be
the penalty of their misdeeds.
Besides, none of us can close our eyes to the
fact that the Democratic party is only for
midable in its own strength. Its power to win
victories has always been found tb depend upon
a sturdy and consistent adherence to its time
honored principles, which have proved suffi
cient to meet every emergency of our national
life. Whatever successes may have attended
a party of opportunity, with sails spread for
every transient breeze of popular sentiment or
excitement, experiment has abundantly dem
onstrated that Democracy is so constituted
that it is only strong when courageous in the i
richt and only victorious when its forces are |
marshaled under its old and well-organized i
standards. j
Our principles are so simple, and they ac
cord so well with the honost American dis
position, which loves freedom and cares for
the public welfare, that they are easily under- j
stood by the Democratic masses. As a result ;
of this, there has never been a time when false
leadership of our party and a departure from
simple Democratic faith have not been qulclily
discovered and ruthlessly rebuked by listless
support, pronounced defection and bitter de
feat. These consequences have thus far been
so inevitable that the lessons they teach can
not be disregarded without Inviting calamity.
The healthfulness of our party may well be
questioned when it shrinks from such an ex- '
amlnatlon of its position as will enable it to
avoid disaster, by keeping in a course of safety,
under the guidance of true Democracy.
Therefore, those who claim to be followers
of Thomas Jefferson will fail to discharge a
solemn duty if in this time of doubt and
temptation they neglect such an examination.
and If this discloses a tendency in party con
trol to subordinate the principles of pure [
Democracy, and to distrust their conquering I
power, then conditions should not continue I
without a bra\-e and early Democratic protest.
I have addressed these words to fejlow Demo
crats In the full consciousness that I am now
far removed from any Influence In party man
agement, but I love the old Democratic party,
and I have written under the sanction of that
"freedom of speech" which Thomas Jefferson
placed amonjr the cardinal factors of our
Democratic creed. Tours very truly,
GROVER CLEVELAND.
A letter from ex-Governor Boies of
lowa was read, in which he advocated the
freedom of Cuba and the giving up of the
Philippines. General Joseph Wheeler also
sent a letter of regret.
Joseph J. "Willett responded to the toast,
"A Century of Democracy."
In responding to the toast, "The Resto
ration of Jeffersonian Democracy," ex-
Governor Canjpbell declared that the
party of Jefferson could not survive half
Democratic and half Populistio. He re
pudiated the socialistic theories brought
into this party by the Populists. Speak
ing of the Chicago platform of ISÂ£Â«>, he
declared that it enunciated many great
and enduring truths, but coupled them to
at least one fatal errorâ the un-Jefferson
ian and (under existing mining and com
mercial conditions) the impossible propo
sion of "10 to 1." The speaker said that
a majority of the electors of the country
were bimetallists. but they had been
forced to choose between the two forms
of monometallism, and they had chosen
gold. In doing so they had been saddled
with a financial bill which created the
most powerful and dangerous of all trusts i
âa money trust. It was sufficient, he said, j
to know that "1G to 1" was dead, and that
just so long as the Democrats proclaimed
their intention to resurrect it, just that
long would their own resurrection be
postponed.
Mr. Campbell declared that the army
of voters had plenty of work at good
wages. Continuing, he said;.
"It will be hard to enlist their co-opera
tion to destroy oppression in Porto Rico,
or stay imperialism in the Philippines, un
less we first abandon the menace to their
own prosperity."

yesterday that will probably cyat short
her racing career. A well-backed starter
In the mile purse run, she was galloping
along in fourth position, when suddenly
Mounce began pulling her up less than
three furlongs from the stand. An exam
ination showed that a small bone In the
right hind ankle had been struck and
broken, and the daughter of Flambeau
hobbled back to her stable on three legs.
Mortgage turned up winner of the race,
making it three straight, by downing La

City's Water Supply.
A communication was yesterday filed
with the Board of Supervisors by S. A.
Kusel, in which he offers a number of
suggestions regarding the purchase of a
water supply for the city. He opposes
the acquisition of the Spring Valley sys
tem on account of the Insufficiency of the
supply for the increase in population and
other reasons. He favors the purchase
of water from Lake Tahoe, but says It
should not be conveyed part of the way in
the beds of creeks but it would be cheaper
to convey it in pipes the entire distance.

Mrs. Nellie Hall, who claims to be the
wife of a miner from Alaska, Is being
held by order of Judge Conlan without
bail until it can be found how far she was
willing to assist on the downward path
the two girls, Mabel Brown and Lottie
Dennison, who were sent to the Magdalen
Asylum yesterday by Judge Fritz. Mrs.
Hall was before the court for having too
good a time Tuesday night, and when she
was in court the two girls testified that
she had tried to induce, them to accom
pany her to Duluth. Minn., where, they
said, she offered to place them in a dis
reputable house. Her case will be inves
tigated further.
TRAINED ANIMALS DO
SOME GREAT STUNTS
Gentry's trained animal show has scored
a decided hit In this city. The exhibition
is probably one of the most novel and
unique ever held under canvas. The ani
mals go through acts that are more start
ling and difficult than was ever performed
by human beings. The entertainment is
a moral and refined one. The exhibition
opened on Saturday evening last and is
scheduled to run two weeks. There is
every probability that its managers will
decide to extend the engagement another
week as the business being done surpasses
their expectation.
BOXERS ARE READY
TO ENTER THE ARENA
Columbia Club Officials Preparing to
Carry Out Their Programme De
spite Police Interference.
The management of the Columbia Ath
letic Club has not receded from its deter
mination to proceed to-night with its pro
posed eeiies of three boxing bouts, al
though no rH-rrnit has been secured. The
club's attorney has informed its officials
that ur.der the law Chief of Police Sulli
van canr.ot carry out his avowed intention
of stopping the contests unless a permit
be secured.
The directors of the club agree to refund
all mosey paid for tickets if they find
themselves unable to carry out their pro
grarrirnrr through police interference. The
poolrooms are not touching any of the
boats owing to the uncertainty which
i-r-f-rns to hang over them.
All three promise weii in the matter of
herd hitting and general aggressiveness.
T he principal one w!U be between young
Peter Jackson and Paddy Purtell at 153
r><->ur,ds. Both are better fighters than
boxers ar.d should provide the kind of
bout the patrons of the ring like to wit
ness. Henry I>-wis and "Bob" Thompson
box fifteen rounds at H2 pounds. The
comedy element will be supplied by Ah
Wing, the Chinese boxer. He was matched
against Kid Dobfeonj but the frk-r.ds of the
latter frightened him out of the affair by
weird tales of the cleverness and hard'
hittir.g ability of the Celestial. Mike
A\elfh will take Dob.-on's place.
MIDWEEK NOTES

Walkers." Popular prices prevail.
There will lie a matiree of "A Bachel
or's Romance" at the California this after

cert will take place at the N California
Theater to-morrow afternoon. The hour
has been changed from 2:30 to 2:15.
PETSCHNIKOFF
AND HAMBOURG
THE second Petschnikoff-Hambourg
concert drew that limited audience
|[ yesterday afternoon that turns out
regularly for all musical events. The
number of people in San Francisco that
can be depended upon to support music
is not as large as it is supposed to be, and
only some extraordinary occasion will at
tract others than the faithful few.
The public can hardly be aware of how
meritorious the diumvirate that is now
with us is, or the oatronage wouH be
more in keeping with the importance of
the event.
Mr. Petschnikoff commands the high
praise that I gave him after the flr-?t con
cert, to which I would add even more if I
had not already said that he Is a '-Treat
artist, which carries with it the fullness
of my admiration for his marvelous mu
sicianship.
I did not dismiss Hambourg In my brief
"comment on his playing, which, however
admirable In point of technique. I still
find unsatisfying. As a manipulator he Is
a miracle of skill and command, but he
lacks ideality: he is certainly not a Cho
pinist. He plays ad captandum and his
wonders of dexterity and speed stun the
senses, but In doing so he does not serve
his art. Hambourg is such a player as
pianists would rave over, but he has not
"the desire of beauty," and some of his
Interpretations are no more the esthetic
expression of music than the Provencal
servente Is an exaHed expression of
poetry.
Petschnikoff is the antithesis of Ham
bourg in this respect. He does not stand
for a false virtuosity, which alone Is suf
fkient to mark him as the greater, ihe
truer artist. PORTER GARXETT.
PLANS for another tall building to
be erected near the newspaper cor
ner have just been decided on by
the Mutual Savings Bank of this
city. The property on which the building
will be erected adjoins the gore corner of
Geary, Kearny and Market streets and
runs through from Market to Geary, with
a frontage of 53 feet on Market and 73
WHERE THE MUTUAL SAVINGS BANK WILL BE MOVED.
on Geary. The plans for the building are
by William Curlett. It will be ten stories
high, of granite and sandstone, and thor
oughly fireproof throughout. The bank
will move into the ground floor, the bank
ing office to take up the whole space.
The upper floors will be fitted with the
most modern office appliances. The build
ing will cost in the neighborhood of $300,
000.
POPULISTS WILL NOT
STAND BY W. J. BRYAN
Coxnmitteeman James B. Osborn Says
There Will Be No Mori Fusion
With the Democrats.
The silver-tongued W. J. Bryan is reck
oning without his host if he expects united
support from the People's party in his
efforts to land himself In the Presidential
chair. At least, that is what is claimed
by James B. Osborn. a member of the Na
tional Committee of the People's party
from Georgia, who is in this city confer
ring with the local leaders of the party
and arranging for its reorganization in
this State. Mr. Osborn was sent here by
the National Committee as its specially
accredited representative.
Mr. Osborn is not unknown to residents
of this State, having resided in Califor
nia some years ago. He was one of the
first organizers of the party in this State.
In discussing Populist affairs yesterday
he said:
"The party is coming out of the wilder
ness of Democracy and into the. promised
land of Populism. The Populists of the
West are now learning what the Populists
of the South have known all. the time â
that there is nothing in common between
the Democratic party and them. Popu
lism stands for the nationalization of
credit: it stands for coin redemption: it
stands for special privileges for none and
equal opportunities for all. Democracy
stands for special privileges to the gold
and silver mino-owners. Populism stands
for the nationalization of trusts as the
only remedy. Democracy stands for
boards of control.
"Fusion with the Democrats almost
Tuined our party organization in Califor
nia. We at one time polled 62.000 votes
here: now a State committee of eight is
all they can get together to act as a tail
of the Democratic kite. The fuslonists
cannot carry Nebraska any more, and the

Mr. Osborn also expressed himself as
much gratified with the result he has
been able to accomplish here. He has in

the party. and says that the State con

KRELING'S GOLD
WATCH FOUND
IN PAWNSHOP
Murder Theory Not Enter
tained by Captain Sey
mour's Detectives..
The Police Satisfied That the Old
Man Committed Suicide
or Was Accidentally
Drowned.
After a thorough investigation Captain
Seymour and his men are satisfied that
F. W; Kreling, whose body was found on
the Berkeley shore a short time ago, was
not murdered, as his relatives claimed.
Dectetive Charles Cody, who was spe
cially detailed on the case, last night sub
mitted his report, showing beyond doubt
that Krellns was not the victim of thugs.
His report concludes as follows:
"From all my investigations I could
not lind any one" who saw the old man
have a watch, as claimed, in his posses
sion prior to his body being found in the
bay. Furthermore, if there had been a
robbery his coat would not have been
found buttoned, which was the case from
the time he left the city until the body
was taken to the Morgue. His collar and
necktie were in good condition when
four.d and there were no marks on his
face or body."
Kreling for years always wore his coat
tightly buttoned, and if he had been the
victim of robbers, the police argue, they
would have unbuttoned the garment in
oraer to search his pockets.
In his report Cody further states that
in an interview with Mrs. John Kreling
she said that the last time she saw the
old man was in the Baldwin Annex. This
was March 30. They were sipping choco
late, when suddenly Kreling arose from
his chair and, looking directly at Mrs.
Kreling. remarked:
"This will be the last time that you and
I dine together."
After he had left Mrs. Kreling recalled
this peculiar remark,, and as he failed to
rtturn by dusk she Became alarmed and
notified the police. A few days later his
body was found in the bay.
Detectives Harper and Sullivan, who
have been investigating the case under
directions from captain Seymour, last
night found Krellng's gold watch in Hy
man's pawnshop at 104 Powell street. An
examination of the pawnbroker's books
showed that it had been taken in by him
on April 9. The man who disposed of the
timepiece gave his name as John J. Don
nelly. He claimed that he had been sent
to dispose of it by a friend, whose name
he reiused to divulge. After recovering
the watch the detectives took It to Mrs.
Kreling to identify it. She promptly rec
ognized the timepiece and admitted that
she had given it to a saloon-keeper to
pawn for her. She, however, declared
that it had been presented to her by
Kreling many years ago.
According to her story Kreling had sev
eral watches. She claims that Kreling
wore one of these when he left her in the
Baldwin Annex. In contradiction of her
statement the detectives have found sev
eral reputable citizens who state posi
tively that Kreling was not in the habit
of wearing a watch.
"Doc" Leahy of the Tivoli says that he
had not seen the old man with a watch
for over six years. He is also satisfied
that he did not have any property in
Brooklyn, N. Y. He declares that he
would "frequently lock himself up in his
workshop on Guerrero street and re
main there for three or four days at a
time.
Sol Kampe of the Columbian building
Informed the detectives that Kreling
never had a watch. He seemed peculiar,
and frequently spoke of his family trou
bles, which seemed to greatly worry him.
Sullivan and Harper In their report to
Captain Seymour state that they askeil
Mrs. Kreling for a description of the
watch which she claimed was worn by the
old man prior to the finding of his body in
the bay. but she was unable to give It.
She. however, referred them to Conrad
Boiler, who, she said, was presented with
a watch by Kreling similar to the one
worn by him. When seen Boiler emphat
ically declared that he had never received
a watch from Kreling.

â Â»
The disposition of the case of Mrs. E. C.
Glffard, special teacher of French, who
was granted an illegal certificate in 1802.
was :he unly matter of importance taken
up at yesterday's meeting of the Board of
Education. A rather heated discussion
followed the introduction by Superintend
ent Webster of the following resolution:
Resolved, That Mrs. E. C. c;iffard. having
faikJ v depont with the !>ui>erint*niient of
Schools a valid certificate as required it" law,
le d*<.lared no lorgÂ»r Â¦ teacher in the nepart
ment and that the position of special teacher
of French in the Mission Hlgti and Adams
Co;:tncpo!:tan Schools be declared vacant.
Superintendent Webster moved the
adoption of ttie resolution, but Director
Donman contended that the final disposi
tion of the case was in the hands or the
board. Webster argued that he alone had
the power to recommend what action
snould be taken. The .board Hnally con
curred in this view, but postponed consid
eration for one week.
A resolution was adopted providing for
the carrying out of the act creating: a pub
lic school teachers' annuity and retirement
fund by appropriating amonth'.y at least
three-fifths of all salary forfeited by
teachers on account of absence from duty.
The time for the school vacation was
fixed at from June 15 to July 30. ISuO.
The salary of Janitor Bennett of the
Mission High School was rlxed at $75 per
month.

SPRING CATARRH CURED.
Remarkable Cures Made by Peruna North
and South.
KISS BERTHA E. WENTNES OF BUCKLEY. WASH.
Miss Bertha E. "W'ejitner, a prominent Sunday-school worker, writes:
"Having tried several remedies for chronic catarrh of the bronchia/
tubes without being helped, I began to think there was < l - <Â»
no cure until I tried Peruna. A great change for the *Â£Â£^m+.
better at once took place, and after two months' faith- ' i r^^^^fak
ful use, Peruna completely cured me. For ihe past S/-Â«t W
six months I have had no catarrh a I symptoms and am |^ if
grateful to testify I owe my complete recovery to j;
Peruna." $h^^L^
Mrs. Mary Cook, Pitts ford, N. V., also says:
-"/ was not very well for six years, paid many -%& MftypfZ
doctor bills, but never improved very much. Two r^> â¢ ' Â¦'
years ago I was attacked with la grippe, which left me Mrs - Mary Cook -
with a severe liver trouble. I gave up hope of ever * *
recovering. Peruna cured me. I feel young again, and am gaining in flesh,
as I was very emaciated. My own children are surprised in the great change
in me when they come to visit me. We have made Peruna our household
remedy."
Hon. A. T. Wimherley. Collector of the
Port of New Orleans. La., and member of
the National Republican Committee, in
writing of Peruna. says:
"I have used Peruna and can gladly
recommend it as being all you represent.
I wish that every man who is in need of
a good tonic could know of it. I would
advise all such to take it now, and am
sure It would never be regretted. "
Peruna is an internal remedy â a scien-
tific remedy for catarrh. It cures catarrh
wherever located. Its cures last. Peruna
gives strength by stopping waste. By
savinp the mucous It enriches thÂ»Â» blood.
By cleansing 1 the raucous membranes it
preserves the vital forces.
A constant drain of mucous from the
system is known a-Â» systemic catarrh. This
may occur from any organ of the body.
Systemic catarrh is more common in
sprinp and summer than in the winter. A
course of Peruna now will do much more
good than in the inclement weather of
winter.

SAN FRANCISCO'S CULTURE.
The Call does not hold itself responsible for
the oDtnlona published in this column, but

most to our hearthstone, an opportunity
for literary enjoyment and education
which may perhaps be said to excel in
the department of pure letters and schol
arship any public . gift for which San
Francisco has thus far had cause to re
turn her public thanks.
"We refer to the course of lectures now
being given at Hearst Hall, Berkeley,. by

poetry, and here be it remarked, notwith
standing the reproach so often thrown at
us of the commercialism of the age and

indeed further add, a drug which brings
healing to the Sure heart and establishes
harmonious â¢ conditions of intellectual

A ROUGH RIDER MILITARY SCHOOL.
A DECIDED novelty in the way of a school or
camp of military instruction 1 has been pro
jected in Colorado, where it is said upward
of 1,000,000 acres of land have been set apart for it
in the Shenandoah Valley, 400 miles from Denver.
It is to be known as "The National Rough Rider
Military Encampment," and its object is to train
young men in all the tactics of mounted infantry â a
class of troops which the South African war is prov
ing to be of wonderful efficiency since the introduc
tion of the weapons now in use among civilized na
tions.
The instruction given will cover all that is required
to make a first-class mounted trooper, or officer, in
cluding rough riding, scouting, trailing, signaling,
and all tactics suitable to that kind of service. A re
cent circular announces: "Governor Charles S.
Thomas of Colorado is the official head, and General
E. V. Sunnier of the United States cavalry service is
the military head of the new organization. Asso
ciated with them as a board of governors are General
Irving Hale, U. S. V.. Colonel S. K. Hooper of
Denver, David H. Moffat of Denver and C. D. Gur
ley of New York. * * * The co-operation of the
War Department and the services of non-commis
sioned officers have been -secured. The young men
will be permitted to join by regular enlistment. They
will be sworn to serve one year, the time required for
the training. Each man will be supplied with a
horse, equipment, clothing for the entire year, rations
and instructions."
If the enterprise be conducted with care it may
develop into one of the best training schools for
young men in the country. A year of such drill and
practice in the open air of Colorado would be bene
ficial to ever}' young man who can afford it, and the
camp will doubtless be attractive to thousands. It is
probable, moreover, that it may be so directed by
governmental influences as to train a valuable corps
of auxiliaries to the regular army.
THE WAR TAX DECISION.
3~"HE decision of the United States Supreme
Court in the case of the American Express
Company vs. Maynard, Attorney General of
Michigan, seems to have disposed of the contention
that it is the duty .of express companies generally, un
der the war revenue law of 1898, to stamp their re
ceipts, bills of lading or other evidences of the con
tract of carriage; but it does not appear to have
settled the other and equally as important contention
of the tax-shirking corporations that it is the duty
of shippers to do so.
From the meager condensation of Justice White's
opinion forwarded by telegraph we gather that the
court has upheld the right of the carrier and shipper
tc contract on the subject.. In other words, it has
been decided that the war revenue law does not im
pose the duty on cither of the parties, but leaves
them to arrange for the stamping between them. If
this is a correct statement of the point made by Jus
tice White, the contumacious express corporations of
California may still be compelled to stamp their re
ceipts and bills of lading. The laws ot this State
have something to say upon the subject, and if they
are not in conflict with the Federal statute â and they
arc not â they may be invoked and given effect in the
esses now pending in the local courts against Wells,
Fargo & Co.
Section 2130 of the {Civil Code says: "A carrier
must subscribe and deliver to the consignor, on de
mand, any reasonable number of bills of lading, of
the same tenor, expressing truly the original contract
of carriage, and if he refuses to do so the consignor
may take the freight from him and recover from him,
besides, all damage thereby occasioned."
And section 2169 makes it obligatory on a common
carrier to "accept and carry whatever is offered to
him, at a reasonable time and place, of a kind that
he undertakes or is accustomed to carry." Other
sections make a bill of lading property and assign'
ablc for value. Under our code, therefore, Wells,
Fargo & Co. must issue bills of lading on demand,
which necessarily implies legal bills of lading, and
since the war revenue act imposes a fine of $50 for
every illegal bill issued, there. is no logical. way out
of the difficulty except for it to issue stamped instru
ments. It follows, therefore, that all California
shippers need do with Wells, Fargo & Co. is to de
mand legal bills of lading, and if they arc not forth
coming withdraw their property and bring. suits for
damages.
' The right to contract for the payment of charges
other than the cost of freightage spoken of by Jus
tice White has unquestionably been taken away from
common carriers in California by the sections of the
Civil Code quoted above, and if the Supreme Court
has gone no further in shifting the burden of this
tax upon shippers than is indicated by the telegraphic
accounts of its decision, there is still a chance out
here to make the express companies buy their own
stamps and cancel them. If they continue to resist
after the law has been interpreted in this way,- and
fitted into the code; it will be in order for shippers
to withdraw their patronage and drive them out of
the State, or for the Attorney General to bring suit
for the forfeiture of their franchises. â¢ . . â¢

ALTGELD ON JEFFERSON.
THE ex-Governor of.lllinois has gnawed his rope
again, and the neighbors are suffering the con
sequences. He told the people in Albany,
X. V.. on Jefferson's birthday what Jefferson would
do if lie were here. His inspiration was doubtless
the Rev. Mr. Sheldon's religious newspaper experi
ment in Topeka. It is Altgeld"s opinion that Jeffer
- :i would . favor Government ownership of every
means of production and agency of distribution, and
would refer every act of legislation to the people by
initiative and referendum and abide by the result. â¢
It might be sufficient answer to the Illinois anarch
ic that Jefferson is not here, and the people do not
accept Bryan as his reincarnation. But one may go
beyond this to the projection of Jefferson's ideas into
the condition of the modern world. In his fir^t in
augural Jciierson dciended the rule of the majority,
which is the necessary condition of republican gov
ernment. But he did not subscribe to the necessary
and inherent righteousness of the will of the major
ity, for he said, "The rule of the majority to be right
must be reasonable."
That fateful sentence carries the whole scheme of
free government by the majority. It is an admission
that the majority may not be reasonable, and there
fore may not be right.
Jefferson said nothing about the means necessary
to rationalize the will of the majority when it is un
reasonable. He admitted that it would be sometimes
wrong, and wrong cannot long rule in government
without grave results. He said nothing about avert
ing those results, though he left it certain that they
would appear. It was left for John Marshall, whose
appointment as Chief Justice by Adams was bitterly
resented by Jefferson, to develop from the constitu
tion itself the rationalizing force to correct the un
reasonable will of the majority when it took on that
form of expression which Jefferson foresaw. That
power Marshall found in the judicial courts, estab
lished by the constitution. They are the branch of
the Government that must rationalize its processes,
which originate with the majority.
Jefferson did not readily accept the constitution in
1789. His Virginia and Kentucky resolutions are in
compatible with that form of bond between the States.
He was jealous of that feature of the constitution
which makes it the supreme law, and his position left
open an issue which was never closed until the Civil
War. decided forever that the constitution made an
indissoluble union between the States.
Marshall saw in the constitution a permanent
limitation of every influence in government which it
vitalized. He saw in it the prevalence of principle as
against expediency in government, and he found in it
the power to rationalize which Jefferson admitted to
be necessary when he admitted that the majority
might not always be reasonable. It is noteworthy
that Altgeld put in most of his time, and all of his gall,
in denouncing the courts, the very branch of the
government necessary to perpetuate it by measuring
all of the acts by the constitution.
S Governor Altgeld closed his initiation of Jefferson
...lo the anarchist ranks with several mouthfuls of
figures, to prove Bryan's popularity as the avatar of
Jefferson. The cold figures that stand over against
his hot ones arc that the Democratic vote for Cleve
lrnd increased 705.858 between 1884 and 1892. The
Republican vote increased in the same time 359,910,
showing a less rate by reason of the popularity of
certain things for which Mr. Cleveland's personality
sfood. Br.t by 1896 that tendency to decrease was
changed. The Republican vote that year increased
2.281.698. and the Democratic vote only 1.652.070, on
the vote of 1884; the Republican gained on the
Democratic increase 629,628 votes. â¢ If this is evidence
of Colonel Bryan's popularity, let it continue.

STOP THE JAPANESE INVASION.
California Press Protests Against the Coming of Hordes of Little
Brown Men.
LOS ANGELES EXPRESS
It would be serious enough if the Japanese coming to this country were of the
better class, but if the reports from Yokohama are correct such is not the case.
It is alleged that charitable societies and possibly the municipal governments of
Japanese cities are taking a hand in the shipping of Japanese pauper laborers
to this country, and it is further alleged that destitute Asiatics are not allowed
to congregate at Yokohama and Tokio, but are sent across the Pacific as fast
as nossihle, this being the cheapest way of getting rid of the undesirable citizens.
In the absence of anything else, the law in regard to the immigration of labor
ers under contract should be rigidly enforced until something can be done to
check the evil. We cannot afford to be made the dumping ground for Asia, and
that is what is in store for us unless prompt and energetic action is taken.

The Japanese are now pouring into this country by hundreds and thousands.
We are informed that upon three steamers, one recently arrived in San Francisco
and two others about due, eleven hundred of the "little men" will be landed at
that port. Probably as many are landing at the Sound ports. Now that they
are pointed this way the stream will increase until it will equal the flood of
Chinese which afflicted us some years ago, and are here now to curse us with
their presence. We need the same kind of legislation against the Japs that was
applied to the Chinese. It is high time for the laborers of this country to give
this matter some thought and take some action in reference to It. . .->, <

It is true that Japan is a country far less populous than China, but yet
Japan could. easily send many thousands to this State who would never be
missed from their own country. Those already here act as advertisers for Cali
fornia, and the tendency is to a steadily Increasing immigration from the
Mikado's empire. Should this immigration continue, as seems inevitable, the
question of restriction must be seriously considered. It may seem a hardship to
shut out such inoffensive and intelligent little men as the Japs, but the welfare
of American labor should be the first consideration and the controlling one.

SAN JOSE MERCURY.
If the Japs continue to pour into the Pacific Coast States it will be in order
for the Government to intimate to the Japanese Government that its subjects
are making themselves too numerous here, and there is little question that a
mild but plain protest of this sort would have the effect of stopping this un
desirable immigration. If not, it will be the duty of Congress to give the subject
its serious consideration. â¢ . .. . -ââ¢ Â¦;
BAN DIEGO SAN DIEGAN SUN.
Are the Japs trying to play the recent American game of expansion or is
their coming due to a pulling influence at work in this country? In other words,
are the Japa coming because they want to come or are they coming on some
thing like an illegal labor contract? This question will be answered sooner or
later, aÂ«u a whole lot will depend upon the answer.

There will soon be an opportunity for the exercise of statesmanship In the
relations between the United States and Japan. It is necessary that Japanese
immigration into this country should be stopped, and yet it la very desirable,
in view of our commercial expansion and ambitions in the Orient, that the
United States and Japan should be on friendly terms..

SAN JOSE HERALD. V
"With Japanese landing on this coast at the rate of two or three thousand a
month it is time to take up the question of Japanese exclusion in earnest.
panics have always exercised over their people a sort of governmental control. In the
mysterious Asiatic way they have held a sort of mastery over the Chinese coolies, which
had its uses in behalf of public order. But there are no Japanese Six Companies. There
may be a sort of padrone system among the Japanese, but they seem to go and come in
bands, and there is over them no authority, no control, like that of the Six Companies.
Judicial notice has already been taken of the prevalence of crime among them. They are
thus early furnishing an undue percentage of criminals. In this respect they are now
ahead of the Chinese. Their offenses are against Americans, while the breaches of the
law by Chinese are mostly against their own kind. In a time of depression these Japanese
will violently resent such measures as were taken to rid certain of our communities of
the Chinese, and there will be very serious trouble, involving our Federal Government
with that of Japan.
All this can be prevented by acting now. This view of what is certain to come
should be impressed upon our own Government. It may be distasteful to now interro
gate the Japanese Government on the subject, but it will be far more distasteful later on
to be interrogated by that Government in behalf of its people who have suffered in a pop
ular storm such as is certain to be; unless prevented by measures taken now.
We know of no other way to reach the result required. If there be another we will
support it effectively. We warn California of the consequences of letting the evil run
unchecked. If this invasion go on and be projected into another period of depression,
who can measure the seriousness of the situation? The Japanese differ from the Chinese
in being truculent, insubordinate and less submissive to control. The Chinese Six Corn-

THE empire of Japan will soon appear to have a reason of its own for assenting to
an agreement with our Government, whereby the migration of its people will be
limited. That empire took on responsibilities in its war with China which compel it
to stand in military readiness for what may come. Its population is not so large that it
can spare many people, for in the day of trial it must demonstrate that physical force
which rests in numbers and discipline. These' conditions present a favorable opportunity
for the negotiation of a treaty which will permit us to exclude Japanese coolies. They
are not needed here, even if they stood by the same standard of life and wages- as our
own people. As we have already made plain, they are less desirable than the Chinese cool
ies. They are less reliable,' less orderly, less thrifty.* - But we need neither class. The Chi
nese exclusion law, honestly enforced, protects us against the coolie laborers from that
country. The need of Japanese exclusion becomes daily more imperative. One steamer
recently landed noo Japanese coolies. The tide rises, the flood is increasing. Its afflict
ing effects are already apparent. The call is louder every day to "our members of Con
gress to take steps leading to a treaty that will arrest -the evil where it is. It is the worst
policy to wait until tens of thousands are here, requiring the expensive institution of a
registry and the operation of more official machinery, wfth more opportunity for craft and
corruption.
It is probable that Japanese will come now steadily at the rate of more than a
thousand a month. When the Chinese evil became so great that efforts began to effect
the exclusion of those people, the managers of their importation loaded every ship that
came, and sometimes a thousand a week were landed. The Japanese evil is in that stage
now, and we may expect a constant increase in the importation. This makes an emerg
ency issue that must be considered. Our coast members should introduce in both houses
of Congress joint resolutions calling on the President to report the condition of our trea
ties with Japan, and reminding the executive branch of the necessity for a new treaty,
covering this immigration evil and conferring upon Congress the power to exclude the
Japanese as the Chinese are excluded. The Call urges our members to. such action. It
cannot be taken too soon.

I forming grace the whole imaginative life
lof the middle apes. Just so the "Faerie
! Queen" gathers into itself the imaginative
life of the central renaissance, and flashes
; It forth to us in myriad forms and hues
'of beauty. The poem is an allegory, a
! dream; yet it ;s ttlled, as no romance of
! the middle aces, with the sense of reality
and of manhood. "To fashion a gentle
man or noble person in virtuous and gen
tle discipline" is, Spenser tells us, his ob
ject; and this end. so characteristic of the
new nation, he achieves through a be
i wilderlng wealth of Inventions and images
; in which all civilizations known to him
I are laid under contribution. The after
â¢ glow of chivalry is in the poem: but hear
say of "fruitfullest Virginia" has widened
Spenser's knowledge of fairyland, and so
have his travels in the worlds of the cias
t=ic poets and of Tasso and Ariosto. \\itn
the frank eclecticism of the renaissance,
these different influences blend in nls
work. - Yet one feels no incongruity in
the poem-rather a perfect harmony. One
i yields. enchanted, to the opulence of
i beauty, to the wealth of exquisite pictures
presented to the inner eye.
Best of all. this seemingly unrestrained
loveliness can be enjoyed without qualm
or scruple. Often the beauty of this
visible world has inspired- gopd men
-with terror. It terrified the monk before
Spenser's day and the Puritan after him.
In a way monk and Puritan are right.
Thai the world of sense is fraught wuh
danger to the spirit no one can watch the
literary davelopment that followed Speen
ser and deny. Spenser knows thl3 well;
his knights are ever on their guard,
md fairyland is one great battlefield.
Yet his imagination, pure and healthful
as it is sensitive, revels in the beauty of
nature, art and humanity, unchecked by
fear Thi3 he can do. because, filled, like
all men ot his day, with devotion to "all
that can make the too much loved earth
more lovely." he is a yet more impas
sioned lover of that unseen and everlast
ing beauty to be seen by the eyes of the
mind only cleared by faith. The "Faerie
Queen " with all its classic adornments,
il profoundly Christian, and Spenser Is a
son of the reformation as well as of the
renaissance. Perhaps this happy synlne
sis could not long endure. On the one
h">nd the Jacobean drama was to follow,
with Its sad revel of the senses: on the
ether, the harsh literature of Puritan
ism But we may at least rejoice that
before this parting of the ways we pos
sess one great poem in which we find the
free ?nd fearless union of sensuous charm
with perfect purity, and the passionate
love of a visible and an invisibl- beauty
are blended for once without strife.
The mood of the nation was to alter.
It was to dream no more of fairyland:
it was to play with life go longer. The
joyous, eager, aristocratic literature of
the first Elizabethan period, with its un
forgettable natural magic, was to be fol
lowed by a literature that expressed an
overwhelming reality of experience and
of passion. In four or five years at latest
after the publication of the first three
books of the "Faerie Queen" will be act
ed "Romeo and Juliet." and Â«hat means
that one poet at least knows tha sorrow
ful depths of the human heart. Already,
in 1557, Marlowe's "Dr. Faustus" has
struck a solemn note like a warning
bell. The day is to a new art: and dur
ing all the rest of Elizabeth's reign, and
through the reign' of her successor, the
chief imaginative energies of the English
race are absorbed in that supremely great
creation, the romantic drama. Not that
other literary forms were superseded.
Lyrics, translations, â¢ patriotic and ro
mantic prose, went on unchecked, while
a noble, reflective prose arose in Hooker
and Bacon. But the drama overshadow
ed all. because it was the fullest expres
sion of life.
There were two currents In th! 3 great
dramatic tide that rose so h!gh In Eliza
bethan literature. ThÂ« first was repre
sented by ~*iakespeare and his contem
poraries and* followersâ Marlowe. Greene.
Dekker. Mlddleton. Heywood. Beaumont
and Fletcher. Webster, Tourneur. Mass
inger and Ford. It was frankly romantic.
It disregarded the unities of time and
place. It was a law, and a noble law,
unto itself: it yielded Its imagination to
the fullness of life. .The counter current,
led by rare Ben Jonson. Shakespeare's
contemporary, clung to the classic tradi
tion. It emphasized form and rule. It
looked at life rather in the abstract than
i.i.the concrete. We know .well . enough

The crosshead of the ferry steamer Sau

while the boat ,was on her way from Sau

trip. The accident delayed the steamer a
short time, but she managed to reach this,

vessel will be laid up for repalra for a few

A Clever Rogue at Work.
For over a year a man who calls him
self a "gunner's mate" (first class) in the
navy has been victimizing people along
the front and In Oakland. His general
mode of procedure Is to go to some hotel
and give them an order, on the Mare
Island steamer Monticello for "a trunk,
bag and hammock and a cage of parrots."
On the strength of this order he generally
makes a borrow of from $2 to $10' and
that is the last seen of him. The money
is generally, easy to procure as the rogue
knows the ways of the navy and tells a
most plausible tale. During his career on
the front the "jackey" has rung the
changes on the Boston. Baltimore, Nash
ville and Ohio, but the majority of his
orders are signed "Gunner's Mate of the
Baltimore."
He changes his name every time he
gives an order, but in nearly every in
stance retains the initials of his given
name. In an order he gave Charles Reb
lin of Fourth and Kentucky streets he
signed himself "K. Albert Thomson." In
another he gave to C. de Flander, 160 l
Market street, he signs himself "K. V.
Vilkelson." One he gave the Ahlborn
House was signed "Karl V. Anderson,"
while another he gave the Winchester
House was signed "Karl V. Smith." Other
t^-ders now on file in the otfire of the
steamer Monticello for "a trunk, bag and
hammock and a cage of parrots" are
signed C. 'Vilhelson, Karl W. Allen, K.
V. Mathiason and Valdemar Olsen. All
the orders are in the came handwriting.
Karl seems to have done a land office
business in getting small sums out of ex
pressmen, runners, hotelkeepers and un
suspecting strangers. '
Transports and Ex-Transports.
The transport Warren goes on the dry
dock this afternoon to be cleaned arid
painted. She will sail for Manila May 1,
and will probably take the recruits now
at the Presidio.
The transport Sheridan will be in port
for quite a time to come. She will have
new decks put in before she again sails
for the Philippines.
The transport Tartar sails for Puget
Sound to-day. On her arrival there she
â¢will be turned over to her owners, who
will put her. in the Oriental trade.
The ex-transport Zealandla goes on the
Hunters Point drydock this morning.
Ehe will be cleaned and painted and will
then be put on the berth for Nome by
the Alaska Exploration Company.
Water Front Notes.
The Ohio Society of California is mak
ing great preparations for the launching
of the battleship Ohio from the Union
Iron Works shipyard.. A circular was
issued yesterday for distribution all over
California and if the hopes of the pro
moters are fulfilled the launching will be
one of the greatest events ever, witnesses
in San Francisco. The State has been
divided Into nine districts and one mem
ber of the committee on organization and
correspondence assigned to each district.
By this means the society expects to place
a copy of the circular in the hands of each
Ohioan (over 15,000) whose name appears
upon the great register, and also In. the
hands of other'Ohloans whose names and
addresses can be obtained.
The mail steamer Moana sailed for Aus

THE GOLDEN AGE OF ENGLISH LITERATURE

XVII. THE ELIZABETHAN AGE.
(Concluded.)
BY VIDA D. SCUDDER.
Garden, not woodland. These Eliza
bethan lyrics, inevitable and careless as
they seem, have not the wilding charm
of ballad or folk-song. Theirs is no "un
premeditated art." They are the product
of culture; though culture, to be sure,
would avail little were they not rooted
In the warm earth of human experience
and nourished by the free sunshine of the
imagination. Their art is of the best kind
which is adopted by nature and becomes
part of her own life, like a rose.
This lyrical outpouring, especially in its
earlier portion. Is full of joy. The lyrics
sing of love, of springtime, of blossom:
they voice the rapturous praise of beauty,
and again return ever to their refrain,
youth and love, love 'and youth. All deli
cate moods of courtship are in" themâ gay.
tender, plaintive, frolicsomeâ only the
depths of passion they never sound. The
ecstacy of. youth is theirs.
This lyrical revel goes on unchecked in
to the reign of King James; only, the
mood changes, and a more serious note
makes itself heard. Meanwhile, though
lyrics were the most characteristic prod
uct of the first .Elizabethan period, many
other literary forms were developing.
They were all marked with the same
strange mixture of experiment and inspir
ation. Criticism In prose sprang up, in
books like Sidney's "Apologie for
Poetrie." itself a splendid prose-poem,
and Webbe's "Discourse of Eng'.ish
Poetrie." It was childish enough, bur
its existence was significant. Art prose
was feeling Its way. getting lost some
times in a maze of affectations, as in
Lyly's "Euphues." and sometimes, as in
Sidney's "Arcadia," reaching under Span
ish and Italian guidance a land of pure
romance. The great Elizabethan transla
tions were beginning and turning a stream
of foreign and classical Influence from the
Latin races upon England. Prose of ad
venture, like Hakluyt's famous "voy
ages," was getting under way. But. in
deed, in one sense. It 13 all prose of ad
venture which the young nation puts
forth at this time, whether people are
shaping the new language to delightful
unwonted uses or recording their explora
tions of distant seas.
This period of romance, of poetic ex-
peare or Jonson: but their contemporaries
tild not know, and Indeed it was no easy
aesthetic Question to decide between their
theories. T.me has dec del, and we do
not here need to follow me drama or tne
Jonsonian tradition, which, with all its
power and energy, proved on the whole
abortive.
After 1500. while the drama was predomi
nant, the nation was passing through va
rious experiences, and the drama reflects
them all. It was the most democratic form
of art that had yet been found. It was not
written of necessity for gentlemen nor by
gentlemen; it came straight from th.>
great, common heart, and to that heart it
appealed. It was not written necessarily
by good men. nor by men who had clear
vision In matters spiritual. Indeed, there
is not much that is spiritual in the litera
ture of the last decade of the sixteenth
century and the following years: it is
human, and its direct naturalism is Its
strength.
At rirst the drama took up the gayety
and charming sentiment and romantic
temper of the time; took up also its patrio
tic enthusiasm; and we have Shakes
peare's wonderful series of romantic com
edies, from "Love's Labor's Lost" to
"Twelfth Night." work so full of bright
ness and beauty, so full of poetry, yet
never for a moment swerving aside from
the great realities of exptrience and life.
We Eave also the noble series of historical
plays. D.^kker. Mlddleton and Heywood.
the other dramatists of this time, express
ed in their plays the same healthy enjoy
ment of life, and at times, as in "Old For
tunatus" and "The Shoemaker's Holiday."
the same feeling for romantic beauty.
Life was seen unveiled and seen as very
good.
But this unhampered sense of power and
pleasure did not last. A deeper quality ami
a sadder crept in; g'.ad spontaneity faded
and the darner aspects of that world
which had been no enthusiastically dis-
I covered and so bravely faced by the early
] renaissance began to Invade men's minds.
The effort after form was not so evident
by this time as in the first period, but an
effort after thought became evident. Men
began to philosophize, to meditate more,
to brood more over life's meaning. Suil
denlv tragady is with v?: a great tragedy,
before which we bow our heads; the trag
edy of "Hamlet" and "Othello," of "Mac
beth" and "Lear."
It is a far cry indeed from the light
some grace of the early work of Spenser
to this drama which probes with unriv
aled and terrible Insight the sorrowful
mysteries of heart and soul. Yet the Jour-
LUMBER DEALERS
FORM A POOL TO
INCREASE PRICE
Advance of Two Dollars
a Thousand Feet Is
Anticipated.
A Committee of Three, Representing
Large Interests, Trying Hard to
Form a Combination of
Local Jobbers.
The price of lumber will be advanced in
this city in a few days if present plans
for the formation of a local lumber pool
are successful, and the indications are
that the deal is about completed. The
advance will be at least {2 per thousand
feet. This is admitted by the lumber
men. Â¦>J't'3vi?^
The fact that a pool is forming has
been kept quiet. One of the members of
the committee of three having the deal
in charge denied that he had any knowl
edge that there would be an increase in
rates, and insisted that all that was in
contemplation was the apportionment of
territory so that one lumberman would
not approach the customers of another.
The committee had agreed not to say
anything about the pool until all the lum
ber dealers in the city had signed an
agreement. There were several who have
been holding out and refusing to sign, but
the larger men in the business had hopes
yesterday that all would soon be in.
The plea is made that the price of lum
ber has been badly cut in this city, owing
to competition. Walter Sutton said that
lumbermen had been selling lumber at $1-4
per thousand in this city, and that the
competition had been very sharp and de
moralizing. The cargo price had been $15
per thousand, and the dealers had lately
been doing business at a loss. Besides
Mr. Sutton, the other members of the
committee are Hugh M. Cochran. man
ager of the Union Lumber Company, and
George L. Swett of Swett, Loop & Daven

MYSTERY SURROUNDS
ARTHUR PERRIMAN
He Disappeared About Six Weeks
Ago and No Trace of Him Can
Be Found.
The mysterious disappearance of Arthur
Perriman, a solicitor for the Mutual Life
Insurance Company, who lived at 119 Lar
kln street, is puzzling his friends and the
police. His disappearance was reported
March 9 and since then Detective T. B.
Gibson has been working on the case, but
has not been able to obtain a clew.
Perriman had been sick and despondent
and left a note for the landlady of the
house that he was going 'to a hospital to
have an operation performed.' He had con
siderable money when last seen. All the
hospitals in the city have been visited,
but Perriman was not in any of them.
He is an unmarried man, thirty-six
years of age. but looks much younger. He
is 5 feet S or 9 inches tall, slender build
and very thin; light complexion, blue
eyes, sandy mustache and brown hair.
OFFICER JOHN KELLY
SHOWED HE WAS BOSS
John Martinson, a Gunsmith, Has
His Family Troubles Aired
in Court.
John Martinson, who has a gunshop at
Clementina and Sixth streets, was charged
before Judge Conlan yesterday with dis
turbing the peace. He lives on Shipley
street, between Fifth and Sixth streets,
and on the evening of April 13 he went
home under the inlluencd of liquor. He
has a wife and six children. The eldest
two are daughters and one is married.
Emma, who is eighteen jears of age, v is
keeping company with George Nelson, a
young man living, close by. ...
Martinson began quarreling with his
family about sending JS to his son-in-law
in Seattle to help bring him home. He
said he did not -want any more sons-in
law of that kind, hinting at Nelson.
Emma went and told Nelson and he re
turned with Â¦ her to the house and de
manded an explanation. Martinson
showed fight. and Nelson was getting the
better of .the' scrap, when Patrolman John
Kelly appeared. Kelson had been warned
of the officer's approach and cleared out.
When Kelly appeared Martinson Jumped
on the table: and' said "I'm boss here."
Kelly said he would show him who was
boss and placed him under arrest. Mar
tinson resisted and. according to his wife,
Kelly hit her husband four times with his
club. The Judge found Martinson guilty
and ordered 1 him to appear for sentence
this morning. . ' ".
SALARIES OF CHINESE
INSPECTORS REDUCED
They Must Los- Considerable Money
Until the End of the Fiscal
Year.
There was a gloomy time in the Chinese
Bureau yesterday morning, when each
member received an official envelope an
nouncing that from April 19 until June 30
of this year the salaries of each would be
reduced from $4 to J3 per day. Chief
Dunn's salary of $8 was reduced to $6 and
Dr. Gardners salary of $t> for the dual
position of inspector and translator was
reduced to 54.
In making the announcement yesterday
Customs Collector Jackson said that he
received notice recently from the Secre
tary of the Treasury that only $ISOO of the
appropriation for the present fiscal year
remained unexpenued, and that it would
be necessary to retrench at once.
It is the intention of the inspectors to
petition the California delegation in Con
gress to add the loss to the appropriation
for the coming fiscal year.
ney from one to the other Is direct, and
can be followed by any sensitive person
who scrutinizes year by year the output
of prose and poetry. It Is not drama
alone that suggests the spirit of weari
ness and gravity which even before the
Queen's death was settling upon the na
tion. The first essays of Bacon, published
in 1597. may be said to usher in this phase
of feeling; the lyric, too. was losing its
first fine careless rapture, and in thÂ»
work of men like Donne was turning to
self-conscious introspection and a more
speculative and thought-freighted feel
ing; while Shakespeare's sonnets, whether
we regard them as personal or dramatic
in method, are the fullest subjective ex
pression that we have of the 3tate of
mind which when Joined to high, imagi
native fervor made straight for tragedy.
Shakespeare himself passed from con
flict Into peace. He gave us during tha
las-t ten years of his life a wonderful
gTOup of dramas of reconciliation â "Tha
Tempest." "Cymbeline." "The Winter's
Tale." Reading them we feel that he was
too great and true a spirit to remain for
ever in the air of storm. But the drama
as a whole moves onward in his success
ors to a melancholy end. They were men
of genius of all but the highest order,
these successors: they Inherited the most
splendid dramatic tradition that the world
had ever seen; they produced wonderful
work. Yet in all this work there is a
subtle- taint. For the drama in them
yields itself to the earth and the pas
sions thereof, and therefore it tries in
vain to escape the deep inner misery that
consumes it. It seeks to escape into ro
mantic beauty with Beaumont and
Fletcher, into satire with Jor.son. In vain.
There is a blight on its beauty, and tha
words that rise to our lips as we read it
are those put again and again into th<Â»
mouth of his characters by Webster. on<*

A complex and wonderfully interesting
development awaited the latter literature
of the renaissance after the death of
Shakespeare. We cannot trace It here.
Even before his death the parting of the
ways had come. For long generations
Enpland was to see no more a Joyous
synthesis between the good. of the flesh
and the rood of the spirit, a hiph ideal
ism founded on knowledge of reality, such
as we find in Spenser. Rather, the na
tion was to see and its literature to re
flect action and reaction between asceti
cism and Indulgence. Puritanism was to
develop on the one hand: on the other,
before the seventeenth century was over,
the degraded drama of the restoration
was to present a last pitiful travesty of
that passion for this world anil the joyÂ»
thereof which had marked the renais
sance. , H*tt

COMMISSION MEN TO
WORK FEWER HOURS
By Vote They Determine That They
Toil Too Long and Adopt
New Standard.
Wholesale fruit dealers and commission
merchants met Tuesday afternoon at the
rooms of the Commission Merchants' Pro
tective Association and took steps to
shorten the business hours of themselves
and others who were not present. The
meeting was called at the instance of H.
M. Jaudin, who presided, and who was of
the opinion that working sixteen hours
per day, which has been the habit of th*
commission and fruit men for years, was
entirely unnecessary hardship. Represen
tatives of about thirty leadlns houses
were in attendance, anad they were per
fectly agreed on the main, pomt â that
twelve hours was long enough to work.
There was considerable discussion con
cerning the hour to begin in the morning
and the hour to stop working at night.
Several propositions were made.
A touch of humor was thrown into the
consideration of the matter by J. J. Duffy,
who suggested when the discussion was in
progress that it would be well to have the
secretary of the meeting address the
wives of the fruit dealers and commission
men and ask them to name the hours.
J. Porter, secretary of the Commission
Merchants' Protective Association, wa3
acting secretary. He declined to send the
letter and the merchants laughed at his
show of discretion. It was finally voted
unanimously as the sense of the meeting
that the business hours should be from 5
a. m. to 5 p. m. InÂ»order to make sure
that the rule should be observed a com
mittee of five was appointed to interview
the transportation eornnanies and see
whether those companies would not agree
not to deliver friegnts to the commission
men earlier than 5 a. m. This proposition
came from A. P. Glannlni of the Scatena
Company. Many fruit men took part in
the discussion, among them being Messrs.
Gianninl, Frank Dalton, J. Wetmore. A.
Campodonico, J. R. Goodall, Garcia Ma
gini. D. Biagi, W. Eveleth, Levy, Meyer.-?,
Xash and Jaudin.
The committee to Interview the trans
portation companies, with instructions to
report within a week, consists of Mr. Mc-
Donough of McDonough & Runyon. A. W.
Porter of Porter Bros. Co., Peter Vucano
vich of J. Ivancovich Co.. J. T. Nash of

Shipping Facilities on the
Water Front to Be ) '
Increased.
Car Ferry Slips at Foot of Lombard
Street to Be Removed and Be
constructed â New Fish
ermen's Wharf.
* Â»
The Board of Harbor Commissioners
yesterday afternoon adopted plans for
four new piers to be constructed between
Union and Lombard streets; also for the
removal of the car ferry slips at Lombard
street from their present positions to sec
tion 3 of the seawall, north of Lombard
street, thus making room for the two
proposed northerly wharves. The plans
contemplate heading the slips to the
northward and as near parallel to the line
of tides as possible. Chief Engineer
Holmes said this would undoubtedly pro
vide the best slips for landing purposes
and give a berth for slip tracks that could
be used at all times, also additional tracks
for switching cars.
Chief Engineer Holmes submitted two
sets of plans for the construction of the
four wharves and the reconstruction of
the two car ferry slips. The other set
had some advantageous features, but also
some disadvantages, one of the chief of
which was that the slip tracks would be
in a bad location, as the vessels lying at
the, pier would be exposed to a ground
swell from the outside, the space for cor-
ral purposes would be contracted and no
additional storage tracks would be sained.
The first set of plans was unanimously
adopted by resolution introduced by Com
missioner Herold and the chief engineer
w.-is directed to prepare specifications for
the work. Bids will be called for within
the next thirty days.
The construction of these additional
wharves will work a great improvement
in the docking facilities of the harbor
front and will be particularly satisfactory
to the north end section. These improve
ments have Ion? been needed, ana the
adoption of plans has been delayed solely
by lack of funds to carry on the work.

the large manufacturers have been In the mar
ket since our last review and have taken some
wool, mostly medium and ground blood do
mestic, both fleece and territory. They, have
purchased a little more freely of medium pulled
wools. The week's business figures up a small
total, howeverâ considerably smaller than that
of the previous week. But as the result of the
looking around on the part of manufacturers
and the taking of sample bags it Is felt by
the trade that an increased business Is about
to develop or Is developing. What business has
been done has been at very ; steady prices,
which are quotably unchanged.

NEW YORK. April IS.â The uncertainties of
the speculative situation were so great to-day
that operators In stocks maintained a hesitat
ing mood and refrained from active operations.
J'rufessional traders found It difficult to in
duce any following either for an advance or
a decline. The street vat full of discussion
regarding conditions in the iron trade, upon
which the movement of stocks seemed to hinge.
Ther- were plenty of authorities who were
v.illing to be quoted In opposition to the
Flocmy view* exrressed by the chairman of
the American t-teel and Wire Company re
garding the outlook In the trade. News of the
concession in prices in some lines of the steel
trade seemed to sustain his views or were per
haps the results of the expression of those
views. The conflict of opinion brought no
<J'-finjte conclusion either way. the whole
tp^culative situation remaining unsettled.
>'rtceÂ» in' the general list started upward, en
couraged l:y higher prices from London and
unilor in. pulse of antagonism to the bear cam
paicn. which Is alleged to be at the bottom
of the selling of iron and Fteel stocks. Fpecu
laturF. however, lost confidence In their own
views as to the tlnccrity of the unfavorable
opinions expressed cvr the Iron trade outlook
when they saw the iron and steel stocks again
manifesting acute depression. American Steel
and Wire told a point below last night. It
did not get back above last night's price In
the subsequent trading and closed 3% off. The
net lc>Â« 01 the preferred was 4 i>olnts. Other
iron and si<Â»el stocks were not co weak. There
fcetrned a Fort of Fpe<ulative duel waging in
Stfel and Wire and Federal Steel, the latter
ttuok civseing the former and closing nearly
a point higher and at a net loss of only V%.
The renewed weakness of tteel stocks being
j>*rceived the opening advances in the general
list bfgan to be conceded. In one or two
of the rallruad t-tockn advances had reached
over a ]Â«jint. but they were very genera.liy
viped out. The market was extremely Irregu
lar for the rest of the day. The New York
tractions and some of the other specialties
eliowed Â»valin<-fs. There was a period of
ctrer.pth later In Sugar, General Electric and
toir.e of the railroad stocks, but these maneu
ver? failed to attract any following or to dis
sipate the filing of uncertainty. Net changes
were mostly email and the closing was heavy
and eluKg'Sh. The money market continued to
work eaÃifr, call loans dropping to 2% per
cent in the last dealings. The sub-treasury
ie di^bureir.g large sums to the market and
New York t-xchange at Chicago rose to 10 cents
discount ti/-day. compared with 40 cents dls-
COOSt on Monday, indicating a relaxation of
interior demand for currency or perhaps a
cessation of the Belling of stocks for Chicago
Â¦ tcount. Sterling exchange continues to har
den and lar^e loans are made on sterling col
lateral. This means that London is taking ad
vantage of the lower interest rates here to

CHICAGO, April 18.â The volume of the
wheat business was not large. The opening
was H@Hc under yesterday. May at 65%@66c
and July at 67V4@67?gC. Cables were weak and
the rains, together with the prediction of
milder weather Boon were regarded as excel
lent from the view point of a grain of wheat
anxious to expand. A small cash business was
done early, and as corn showed a disposition
to ascend the market firmed up some, May
touching 66% c and July 67% c. There was con
siderable long May put Into the pit on the
bulge and there was some outside selling un
der the pressure of which May declined to
65% c and July to â¬6?il?66TÂ»c. About noon the
strength of corn was more apparent and with
the added assistance of a New York report of
thirty-five loads taken for export the market
slowly recovered and closed steady %c down,
May at 6bc and July at 67% c.
The corn market was fairly active and strong.
Heavy buying by Influential interests proved
the main factor. Two men between them ab
sorbed 2,000.000 bushels; or were credited with
t-o doing. The movement from now on is ex
pected to be light as farmers are busy in their
fields. May closed %@->Â»c up; July closed
%c up.
The oats market was quiet and rather firm.
There was not much selling pressure and the
corn strength was a help. May closed Me up
and July Vie Improved.
The provision market was quiet, but steady,
at a slight decline from yesterday. Hogs were
lower. There was a fair cash demand for lard.
May pork closed 5c down; July 5c down; May
lard closed 5c lower and July 2%c depressed.
May ribs closed &jj7%c lower, as did July.

and children and stealing anything they
can get hold of.

SCHOOLGIRL'S FOOD.
A Very Important Question for Grow-
A little girl in Providence, R. 1., high
school was badly run down, owing to
i he fact that she was not properly fed.
When her parents discovered the value
of Grape- Nuts food she quickly recov-
ered. Her father's letter is as follows:
'"Without any desire whatever for
publicity â in fact, with every desire to
avoid it, I j-et would like you to know
of the following in reference to Grapc-
'My daughter is in the Providence
High School. English department, and
working very hard, her studies tellinjf
on her sercrclyj partly because of a se-
rious iijr.ess she had some two or three
years since. She has been accustomed
to take rr.eat luncheons with her. and to
obtain a cup of hot drink, often of milk,
;.t *he school building. She came home
quite hungry, however, on most occa-
sions, and Bomewhat exhausted.
"Three months ago she began to
carry Grape-Xuts instead of her meat !
sandwiches, and now will not forego
them. She says she can stand the after
study on them better and has no sense
of exhaustion on reaching home, al-
though always able to enjoy her meal, as
her appetite is good.
"We regard this as strong testimony in
favor of Grape-Xuts, and if s*ou can use
it without publishing our names we
shall be pleaded to have you do it. and

FAMILY RUMPUS
Mother-in-Law for Once Acts
the Role of an Angel
of Peace.
Mrs. Davis Is Still Determined to
Strive for a Divorce From
Her Preacher- Actor
Spouse.
Â»
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
111S Broadway, April 18.
Alta Klngore Davis, the beautiful young
songstress who yesterday announced her
Intention to secure a divorce from Ed
wards Davis, the former pastor of the
Central Christian Church, declares that
she was compelled to go oh the stage to
save herself from starvation. The dainty
little artiste has not everything her own
way. Friends of the former Oakland
preacher announce that he will resist any
effort of his pretty wife to secure her
freedom. Altogether there Is prospect for
a merry time over the Davis' marital dis
turbances.
Mrs. Davis announces that she has re
tained Attorney Thomas V. Cator. her
father's former law partner, to press her
cult. while on the other hand It appears
that recent correspondence from the hus
band carries his declaration that he had
done all within his power to support Mrs.
Davis and that he proposes to fight back.
That the a.ctor-prÂ«.achrr has had a rea
sonable amount of success In his theat
rical aspirations Is asserted by those who
have recently been advised of his rp.ove
ments. Davis had a part in Charles Cogh
lan's company in New York and still later
traveled with one of the Frohman road
companies. Without definite information
on the subject his friends infer that the
young man has now cut out the theatrical
profession as his life work. His bent was
in that direction and his ministerial labors
in Oakland were, strongly tinctured with
the dramatic.
Mrs. Davis busied herself to-day In de
nying a large number of rumors which
had floated about concerning the domestic
troubles. She Insisted that jealousy was
not at the bottom of her complaint. Like
wise she was emphatic in her declaration
that her husband was not a victim of the
green-eyed monster.
"There was never any trouble of that
kind between us." said Mrs. Davis. "I
had be^n playing a leading part in "The
Prodigal Father in New York and went
on the road when my health gave out.
and I returned to my parents In Oakland.
I was forced of necessity to adopt the
stape, not through any love for the theat
rical profession: but now that I have
taken up the work I propose to go ahead
and make a success of It."
Mrs. Davis Intended to po East to
night. She says the publicity given her
plans has delayed her temporarily and
some days may elapse before she departs.
Mrs. Kinpore, the young woman's
mother, has stated that many letters have
been received by her daughter from the
husband in the Last and that they abound
with sentiments of affection and devotion.

CONFESSION OF
HIS WIFE GIVES
HIM A DIVORCE
Rev. Guy W. Smith Released
From His Matrimonial
Obligations.
Woman's Admission of Her Error
Is Used by the Clergyman
to Secure His
Freedom.
Oaklar.d Office San Francisco Call,
111$ Broadway. April IS.
Rev. Guy W. Smith, pastor of the First
Christian Church, has been freed frcm the
matrimonial chain which bound him to
Laura M. Smith. Upon testimony which
Mrs. Smith furr.ished the clergyman was
t;ra.nted a divorce to-day by Judge Ogden.
In all the ramifications of this unusual
case nothing has teen more peculiar than
the attitude cf the wife, who came 1500
rei'.es from her horse in Nebraska to make
thÂ« way easy for the severance cf the
xr.arita! bonds. Even wniie the case has
been pendir.g before the court the wife,
who had voluntarily abandoned her rights.
J.as been the s^est cf her husband's par
rr.ts at Pacific Grove. Although the ax:
cusatiori in the divorce complaint was of
v most eorious character, the testimony
â¢rhlcb caused the granting of the decree
casaÂ« practically from the lips of the ac
. j>ed woman, for It was her voluntary
:jl> of error which her husband used as
the basis of his action for divorce.
There was no effort made by Mrs. Smith
to refute any of the charge.*, nor was any
testimony taken beyond that which was
legally sufiicient to establish the proof.
The case was contested at no point. As
soon as the stautory preliminaries had
Veen fully met, the case in regular order
was referred to the Court Commissioner.
Before him the testimony mÂ« taken and
then sent bark to Judge Ogden. who has
had it uTider judicial examination for eev
crai wteks.

EIGHT-HOUR BILL
READY FOR ACTION
House Sub-Committee Reach a De
cision on the Final Form of
the Measure.
WASHINGTON. April 18.â The House
Sub-committee on Labor, in charge of
the Gardner eight-hour bill, reached a de
cislon to-day on the final form of the bill
and on several amendments, all of which
will be reported to the full Committee on
Labor next Friday, when It Is expected
final action will be taken. The bill has
attracted much attention In labor circles,
being actively urged by the American
Federation of Labor, and has been ener
getically opposed by many large steel,
armor, ship building and ammunition
concerns doing business with the Govern
ment, as the measure will have the effect
of fixing an eight-hour day on armor and
like commodities and in the building of
warships.
The amendments adopted to-day are in
tended to overcome objections raised dur
ing recent extended hearings. One of
them provides that the act snail not ap
ply to transportation. This, is to over
come the objection that goods en route
to a factory where Government work was
being done might be held up because the
trainhands did not conform to the eight
hour rule. Another amendment provides
that the act shall not apply to goods
bought by the Government in open mar
ket. This is to overcome the objection
that the eight-hour restriction could be
carried back to the mines, lumber camps
and all "points producing raw material
which later, goes Into Government arti
cles. These and other amendments are
destined to free the measure from the
chief objection brought against it, and
some of them were drafted by the Feder
ation of Labor authorities. The action of
the sub-committee was not unanimous to
day In ordering a report.

Senator Perkins visited the Navy De
partment to-day to confer with officials
regarding the establishment of a coaling
station at San Diego. He has strong
hope that the department will decide to
locate the coaling station there, in view
of the proposed improvement of San
Diego harbor, which will allow the entry
of larger battleships and cruisers. The
only opposition of the department officials
to the establishment of this station haa
arisen from the inability of the largest
warships to enter the harbor. With this
objection removed, as it will bÂ« by the
work in the harbor now contemplated, it
is probable that the department in a tew
days will give a favorable decision In the
matter.
Secretary of the Interior Hitchcock to
day sent a letter to Chairman Lacey of
the House Committee on Public Lands
concurring in the recomendation of com
missioner Hermann 6f the General Land
Office, that the Senate bill granting the
use of Lake Tahoe Reserve to the Lnl
versity of California be not passed by-
Congress. An adverse report was made
by Commissioner Hermann and Secretary
Hitchcock on a similar bill recently intro
duced In the House. The main reasons for
reporting adversely are that the. greater
portion of the reserve is covered with
merchantable timber, and that the privi
lege of disposing of its products is too
valuable to give to any private institu
tion, and sucfi action might be used as a
precedent in similar propositions relating
to other forest reservations.
The California delegation was to-day
accorded an extended conference by Sec
retary of the Interior Hitchcock. The
llrst matter discussed was the California
mineral lands bill. While this bill here
tofore has been favorably reported upon
by the Commissioner of the General Land
Office, it has never been officially indorsed
by the Secretary of the Interior. The
bill Is now before him for consideration
and it was the desire and object of the
delegation to consider the matter at
length with him, with a view of securing
his affirmative indorsement. Attorney
General Tlrey L. Ford of California par
ticipated in the conference. The various
points touched upon by the bill were gone
over in detail, and some suggestions were
made by the Secretary of the Interior
and the Commissioner of the General
Land Office. The Secretary expressed
himself "as in sympathy with the objects
of the bill. He recommended certain
amendments affecting the operation of
the bill, which later will be submitted to
the Committee on Public Lands in his
report. The delegation is satisfied he
will approve the bill. This will be a very
advantageous step in the way of its
passage. The delegation came away well
pleased with the interview.
The second matter considered was the
question of the acquisition of the Cala
veras grove of big trees. The situation
seems to be that the Secretary has exer
cised every endeavor to obtain these trees
for a reasonable consideration, j He has
not been met with any fair proposition,
but It appears that those who are.con
trolling uhe groves are Insisting upon a
price that Is extortionate and unreason
able. The unanimous opinion of those
present at the conference was that any
demands of this kind should be resisted.
It Is evident from the disposition of the
Secretary of the Interior <hat he is ex
ceedingly anxious to acquire the groves
for the Government. The California dele
gation In Congress Is likewise anxious to
bring about this result, but all, parties
agree that no extortionate and extrava
gant price should be paid. What the next
stepÂ«will be has not yet been determined,
but It is certain that Mr. Whlteslde and
those In control of the groves are not go
ing to realize any extortionate figure for
those trees.

MID-ROAD POPULISTS
ADOPT A NEW NAME
KANSAS CITY. Mo.. April IS.â The mid
dle-of-the-road Populists at their mass
convention to-day effected a permanent
State organization and adopted a new
name â the Progressive People's party. The
name will be presented to the national
convention for ratification. The platform
demands legislation on lines demanded in
the Omaha platform; urges the reduction
of State and count}" salaries to correspond
with the prices paid for products; de
nounces both the old parties for failure
to enact initiative and referendum legisla
tion for the protection of corporation in
terests and for legislation for the protec
tion of national banks; condemns W. J.
Bryan and John D. Rockefeller for their
alleged connection with trusts, and espe
cially censures the Democratic State ad
ministration because of Its disregard of
the paramount Interests of the people.
A full State ticket, headed by Richard
Thomas of Saline County for Governor,
was named. Captain W. C. Aldridge, a
farmer of California, Mo., who was the
favorite candidate for Governor, declined
the nomination. The convention selected
twenty-five delegates to the Cincinnati
convention and sixteen Presidential elec
tors. The delegates to the Cincinnati con
vention were instructed to vote first and
last for "Wharton Barker for President and
Ignatius Donnelly for Vice President.
Three or four delegates spoke In favor of
the nomination of Tom Watson of Georgia
for President, but they were unable to
bring out many Watson votes.

after being severely lectured by the Judge
he was discharged. The rabbi said the
boy claimed to be a son of his dead
brother, but he doubted the truth of the
statement.

RAFAEL KNOCKED OUT.
Turner Gets a Decision Over Him in
the Fifth Round.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON. April 18.â Frank Rafael of
San Francisco was knocked out In the
third round of what was to have been a
twenty-round bout before the Stockton
Athletic Association In this city to-night.
The men fought at 133 pounds. Superin
tendent George Eckhardt of the Athletic
Club refereed the fight. Turner was a
favorite in the betting In this city, the
odds being 10 to 8. In the first round
Rafael reached Turner's solar plexus with
a terrific left. The colored lad's face was
contorted with pain and he dropped his
hands. Rafael came in: Turner clinched.
After the breakaway it was give and take,
both men landing lefts and rights, being
equally clever at infighting. Rafael was
cautioned for hitting in clinches. The
second round was torrid, neither man
having the best of It. The white man
tried to finish the contest In the third. He
landed a left on Turner's face. Rafael
tried a right: Turner crossed him with a
left hook square on the point of the Jaw
as the white man was coming in. Rafael
dropped and was out for fully a minute.
Considerable money changed hands on the

fighter, and his fighting blood began to i
boil.
"Me no sabee," he said, with a sneer.
Tono repeated the order and Wing made
the same reply. Tono complained to the
lady and she went with him to the kitchen
and asked Wing for an explanation. He
said he would not take an order from
Tono and she chided him for his conduct.
As soon as she left the kitchen Tono
began to laugh at Wing, who seized a
poker and struck Tono on the head. Tono,
although stunned, circled round Wing,
trying to grab hold of his queue, and Wing
smashed him again on the head with the
poker. This was too much for Tono and
he fled. Just as he disappeared out of the
kitchen door Wing hit him again on the
head with the poker and chased him Into
the street. Tono kept on the run till he
reached the Japanese Gospel Mission on
Geary street, where he told his tale of
woe. He was taken to the Receiving: Hos
pital, where his wounds were dressed and
yesterday morning he appeared with an
interpreter before Judge Mogan and swore
to a warrant for Wing's arrest on the
charge of batter)'- He told the Judge
through the Interpreter that he did not
mind being hit with a poker, but it hurt
his feelings to be "licked" by a Chinese.

and was released on giving $10 cash ball.

ENTRIES FOR DOG SHOW
MUST BE MADE QUICKLY
Lists Will Close on Sunday, After
Which No More Dogs Will
Be Received.
The officials having charge of the list
ing of entries for the forthcoming bench
show of the San Francisco Kennel Club
are kept continually busy at the office, 233
Montgomery street. Entries close next
Sunday, and owners intending to name
their dogs sjhould not delay. No pedigree
is necessary and dogs educated to perform
tricks will nnd special classes. The en
trance fet is $3. The regular prizes are
$5. $3, medals and diplomas. Special
prizes consist of silver cups and trophies,
ranging in value from $25 to $75.
Among the St. Bernard-entries are Judge
Troutfs magnificent rough-coated dog,
Xenophon, by Colonel Bernard out of
Nellie Bland, and Fred Bushnell's smooth
coated champion, Le Prince Jr. It Is
quite likely the champion will have to
flght it out with Xenophon for the Ford
trophy.
N. H. Hickman's Warren Sceptic is also
going to run up against some tough rivals
for championship honors. J. B. Martin's
unbVaten fox terrier, Alden Swagger, is
in the pink of condition. The Rev. J. W.
Hlnton's Aldon Artist has developed Into
a wonderfully fine dog. while G. L. War
ing of Santa Monica will send up Sweet
William, a terrier that can hold his own
in the best company.
The puppy class in bull terriers will be
an exceptionally large one. "Dick" Roun
tree, secretary of the Pacific Bull Terrier
Club already regards as his own the
stein offered for the best dog puppy, but
Mr Winchell thinks he has a surprise in
store for Mr. Rountree in an eleven
months-old puppy by Woodcote Wonder
out of Champion Sunshine. The puppy
arrived yesterday In fine condition and,
with his fine head and legs, will certainly
take a lot of beating.

<=Tf=3IIE Fifth Congressional District Re
publican Committee will meet to
ll night In the office of W. H. Cobb.
Parrott building. The meeting is
called by the chairman. Max Goldberg,
to consider the advisability of holding
primaries for the election of delegates to
the district convention.
In the Fourth District a resolution de
claring in favor of primaries has been
adopted and the Fifth has been requested
to adopt a resolution of similar character
and to fix a day on which the election in
both districts may take place.
There is a peculiar state of affairs In
the Fifth District. Last June J. Alva
Watt, â¢ who was chairman of the conven
tion in 189S which nominated E. F. Loud
for Congress, appointed the following to
compose the district committee: E. I.
Robinson, W. H. Cobb, Frank French, G.
H. Fairchild, Max Goldberg, Jesse Marks,
F. R. Danforth, Alvinza Hayward, R.
Donovan, Louis O'Neal and J. D. Mac
kenzie.
The commltttee organized last month
by the election of Max Goldberg as chair
man and Louis O'Neal secretary. Whether
J. Alva Watt had authority to appoint the
committee is still an open question. He
claims that a resolution was adopted by
the convention of September, 1838, which
conferred upon him the power to appoint
the committeee; but when the committee
met for organization he did not produce
the records of the convention. When the
Fourth District committee was called to
order the records of the convention of IS9B
in that district were produced and read,
to show, the source from which the com
mittee derived Its power to manage the
initial affairs of the present campaign.
There seems to be a desire on the part
of Republican voters in the Fifth Dis
trict to have a voice In the selection of
delegates to represent them in the district
and State conventions which will meet
next month to choose delegates to the
National Republican Convention. At the
recent meeting of the State Central Com
mittee J. Alva Watt announced that
primary elections would be ordered In the
Assembly districts of San Francisco
within the boundaries of the Fifth Con
gressional District. Since that announce
ment'was openly made in the presence of
a hundred Republicans ; Watt seems to
have* changed his intentions. Others
have * changed front, hence considerable
opposition to the holding of primaries has
been developed.
Various reasons for the change of base
are given. One member of the commit
tee Eays that he fears that. the A. P. A.'a
will get In and capture the works. An
other member apprehends that Martin
Kelly's rounders from the Fourth District
will. swing about and seize the primaries
in* the Fifth. The reasons are not good
and sufficient. They are not the real rea
sons for the change of front.
The Call, having made careful inquiry
and- close Investigation to ascertain the
actual cause for opposition to primaries,
reaches the ' conclusion that' the opposi
tion'is secretly directed by Collector of
Revenue John C. Lynch and that the said

The City , Attorney 1 yesterday informed
the Assessor, that he is not warranted un
der the law to allow an : estate having
money in bank, to deduct: from -the same
the amount due as -collateral, inheritance
tax: therefore the estate Is not entitled to
deduct from any of its solvent creditors
the amount of any 'tax it may owe to the

OPPOSES THE GRANTING
OF SPECIAL PERMITS
Reed Lays the Law Down to His
Associates in the Board of
Supervisors.
Supervisor Reed yesterday addressed a
communication to his .associates- In" the
board in which he submits several. reasons
for opposing the 'granting of .any. privi
leges for permanent encroachment. on the
sidewalks of the city,: which" he 'holds- to'
be in violation of the charter provisions.
"I think it is evident," says Reed, "that
at the present time numerous citizens are
succeeding in evading the provisions of
ordinances affecting the whole municipal
ity by receiving special privileges^from
the board. These tnings are of the nature
of 'political pulls,' mar the general admin
istration of the law and make the citizens
feel that if they have sufficient Influence
they, can avoid the general enforcement of
ordinances.
"I therefore submit tha,t the policy , of
granting' special permits Â¦to maintain
either permanent or, temporary encroach
ments .upon the sidewalks or the streets
is. unwise in practice, contravenes one -of
the main principles of the charter and is
calculated , to destroy the equal adminis
tration of the law."
Will of Hippolite Dutard.
The will of Hlppollte Dutard ; was filed
in the Probate ; Court yesterday. It 'be

to his widow, Eliza. Dutard, who, with
Walter D.. Sheldon, William C Barnard
and Charles , B. Stone, jis named as .ex

clerk of the deceased ? and provision is
made in the will that he be employed In a
similar capacity by the estate.to be paid
for his services In addltlon/to his com
missions as executor. The estate . is val
ued at $800,000.
Declines to Investigate.
President McKlnley has notified the
Anti-Civil Service League of this city that
he declines to order an Investigation as
to the alleged discrimination made against
veterans of the Civil War at Mare Island
Navy. Yard as there are no available
funds for such an investigation.
The league at its meeting last night
commended Recorder Godchaux for hi 3
effort to nulify the civil service clause of
the new charter and after pledging all
delegates to the various conventions to

JAPANESE IMMIGRANTS
ARRIVE IN THE NORTH
Hundreds of Them, Bound for Thi-3
Country, Are Landed in Victoria
by Steamer Miles.
VICTORIA, B. C, April 18.â The steam
er Miles arrived to-night from Kobe with
1200 Japanese immigrants, a majority of
whom are destined for the United States
to work on the railways.
TACOMA, Wash.. April IS.â The present
importation of Japanese to Puget Sound
has reached unprecedented figures, and
thousands more of the subjects of the
Mikado are now afloat headed this way
During the month of .April, 3500 Japanese
have been landed in Puget Sound ports
and British Columbia, and of the men
landed In the latter ports fully two-thirds
find their way across the border.
The reasons for the present rush is that
the Japanese are leaving .their native
land in consequence of the reported im
minence of war between Japan and Rus
sia, and that the closing of the gates of
Hawaii has diverted the stream of Jap
anese this way. The rush will end as sud
denly as it began within the next few
daysâ when the demand tor men in the
canneries and the railroads is satisfied.
TEN OF THE TYROLESE
UNDER FRIENDLY CARE
Will Be Given Employment Here Un
less the Government Takes Up
Their Case.
The ten Tyrolese who escaped from the
Doric have found asylums in 1 this city, and
there is a possibility of a legal fight be
fore it is decided whether they are to
remain or are to be sent back to their own
country. .
Seven of the immigrants are quartered
on the southeast corner of Broadway and
Kearny streets over the saloon kept by
John Tarato, who was instrumental in
their escape. The other three are living
in a lodging-house at 270 Brannan street.
Just what the legal status of. the immi
grants is is a question. They cannot be
extradited, for they have committed no
crime either in this country or their own.
They cannot be sent on to Honolulu, for
this country does not recognize the con
tract that requires their presence there.
The only solution of their case from the
standpoint of the Government seems to be
to send them back to , Austria on the
ground that they are not entitled to re
main in this country under the immigra
tion laws..
They desire to remain here and. their
friends promise that if they be allowed. to
stay they will be given work sufficient to
keep them from becoming public charges.
EXPERT KYTKA AND HIS
NEGATIVES IN EVIDENCE
Photographs of Fair's Signatures Be
ing Made Part of Record in
Sensational Trial.
There was nothing but negativesâ soft,
contrasts and otherwise, prints hard and
soft, contact and porcelain, and a string
of dry questions, in the Fair case. yester
day afternoon. There were photographs
of the signatures to the marriage con
tract, to the deeds, to the letters and
agreements and to. numerous checks.
These had been photographed singly and
in groups, in all kinds of lights and under
all circumstances. -and it took all the
afternoon to get them properly before the
court.
i Kytka, the writing expert, was called
to the stand, and the first question Croth-
ers put to him wa3 objected to by Charles
Pence. Pence did not want the enlarged
photographs to go in and when the court
allowed them he objected to any question
as to the characteristics they brought out.
Pence claimed "that the negatives and
prints could speak for themselves. Me-
Knerney declared, an expert had the right
to call attention to what the . prints
?showed, and Budd took the opportunity
to address the court on behalf of Crothers'
search for Information. The question was
allowed and with a general exception
noted the negatives ana prints were filed
as evidence as fast as Crothers could pass
them in.
The photographs of the signatures on
the deeds and "republication" letter were
submitted for identification only, as it is
the Intention of counsel to argue, the deed
matter next Tuesday. It will.be^tttempt
ed on the part of the Fair peopi* to in
clude the deeds in the general litigation,
an intention that will not prevail without
strenuous objection from counsel for Mrs.
Craven-Fair. , Â¦ .
" The case will go on'agaln.thls morning.
Lynch has been acting for and 13 now
representing Herrin and Burns.
The selection of delegates to the na
tional convention cuts no figure in the cal
culation of the railroad agents. They are
not for or against any candidate for con
vention honors. They are working se
cretly, however, to get possession of the
next Republican State Central Committee.
Lynch has been writing to men in e%*ery
section of the State to ascertain who will
be sent to the State convention. It is not
surprising that he wants a packed delega
tion from the Fifth Congressional Dis
trict.
Collector Lynch is not a dangerous poli
tician, but he will do desperate work when
his masters require it. "When the whole
inside history of the late Senatorial cam
paign is revealed to the public of Califor
nia it will be truthfully told that Lynch
handed to a member of the Legislature at
Sacramento a sheet of paper, representing
that the words written on the paper were
contained in a dispatch wired from Wash
ington by Senator Perkins to a well
known residi^^>f Sonoma County. The
message so conveyed to the member rep
resented that Senator Perkins had re
quested" his friends to vote for Burns. Sub
sequent investigation established the fact
that no such message was ever sent by
Senator Perkins and no such message was
ever received by the Sonoma resident to
whom it was said to have been addressed.
It was a stupid, clumsy forgery, designed
to gain a vote for Burns by fraud.
Several members of the Legislature
know of the efforts made by Lynch to
persuade or coerce Assemblyman Bliss' of
Alameda into voting for Burns. The Col
lector resorted to Influences which if not
indecent yere grossly Impertinent and
offensive to men who keep politics out
of the family circle.
It might be well for Republicans in the
various counties of the State to give par
ticular attention to the duty of recom
mending State Central Committeemen to
the convention.

WOULD EXCLUDE THE
JAPANESE HORDES
Pacific Coast Congressmen Agree That Steps
Should Be Taken to Shut Out Undesir
able Immigrants.
Special Dispatch to the OalL
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLINGTON HOTEL,
WASHINGTON, April 18.â Regarding the great influx of
Japanese to Pacific ports, members of the California delegation
nvcrc asked to-day briefly to express their views as to the best means
to deal with the matter.
Senator Perkins' Views.
"Under existing conditions the United States Govern
ment cannot prevent Japanese from entering this country
except under provisions of the contract labor law. Un
doubtedly a very large number who have come here have
been paid to come by private companies, whose agents In
the United States have brought Japanese here with the
Intention of employing them. Under these conditions the
steamship companies whose ships bring in this class of
immigrants would be obliged under the law to carry them
back to their own country. The Federal officers should be
vigilant in detecting violations of the immigration laws."
Representative Barham's Idea.
"The Government has the power absolutely to restrict
Ell Immigration, and if the people of the country wish to
keep out undesirable Japanese It is within their power as
pxercised through Congress to do so. Congress has author
ity to prohibit either skilled or unskilled laborers from en
tpring the United States, and Congress should exercise this
power of restriction if conditions seem to demand."
Representative Waters' Remedy.
"I think the best policy would be, perhaps, on our part
for the United States to approach Japan with a proposi
tion for modification of the existing treaty, if any modi
fication were required, looking to the restriction of immi
gration. We are not only on friendly terms with Japan,
hut th? relations of the two countries have been and are
especially cordial. I believe Japan would meet us half
J. A. BAIMIAM
way in any effort to prevent undesirable classes of that
country from coming inuo the United States."
Representative Needham's Stand.
"The immigration of Japanese laborers ought to be
etopped. I favor any executive or legislative action that
will bring about this result."
Representative Kahn's Remarks.
"This matter of immigration of Japanese laborers
Bhould receive the immediate attention of the authorities.
I believe the best way to meet the question is for Congress
to pass an exclusion act, similar to that governing Chinese
Immigration."
Representative Loud Reticent.
Representative Loud was disinclined to express any
rpinion as to what now should be done in the matter until
he had more thoroughly studied the question and famil
iarized himself with existing conditions relating to It.
Representative De Vries for Exclusion.
"Congress alone has the power to restrict, regulate and
prohibit Japanese immigration into the United States.
There are no treaty stipulations, expressed or implied, that
prohibit or stipulate against such legislation by Congress
In respect to Japanese laborers. On the contrary, it is .ex
pressly stipulated In the treaty of commerce and naviga
tion between this country and Japan of 1894-95 that this
country may so legislate. It is there provided: 'Citizens

MAKION" DE VRIES
or subjects of each of the two high contracting parties
shall have full liberty to enter, travel or reside In any part
of the territories of the contracting parties,; and shall
enjoy full and perfect protection for their persons and
property.' It Is further provided: 'It is, however, under
stood that the stipulations contained in this and the pre
ceding article do not in any way affect the laws, ordi
nances and regulations with regard to trade, immigration
of laborers, police and public security which are in. force
or which may hereafter be enacted in either of the two
countries.' It will thus be seen from the terms of the
treaty that Â».he power to pass laws against immigration of
Japanese laborers has been expressly reserved in the
United States. In my, judgment, the only. possible way to
prevent the incoming of the threatened hordes of, Japanese
laborers is for Congress to prohibit their future immigra
tion to this country."
national and municipal, adopted the fol
lowing resolution:
Resolved. That we denounce the attempt be
lr.gr made by certain employes In Washington
in the State and Navy Departments to spcut*
the passage of pension legislation in their be
half as un-American, inimical to the interests
of the taxpayers, who will be saddled with an
additional burden, and as the logical result of
a life-tenure system, and we believe If such
legislation can be secured then every private
employe can likewise demand a pension when
he becomes superannuated.
