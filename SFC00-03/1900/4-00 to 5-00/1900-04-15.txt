Whenever the British berjin to move about, either in larg^ or small bodies, they find the Boers

PARIS. April 14.â ThÂ» Exposition of
1900 is opened, but it will be at least
a month- before anything but bulld-
I ings Is to be. seen. The day's cere
monies was a peculiar mixture of
sumptuous splendor In the Salles dcs
Fetes and widespread confusion else
where. Nothing could have exceeded the
picturesque stage setting In the beau
tiful bu:.dlng In which the ceremonies
were held, the gorgeous uniforms of the
diplomats and soldiers, the splendid or
chestra and chorus and the mapnlflcence
effected by the grand staircase, up which
President Loubet proceeded to view the
Exposition, lined with some 200 picked
men of the Republican Guard, with
jackboots, white breeches, gleaming cuir
asses and horsehair plumes streaming
from shining helmets. At the top of this
stairway was a room the Interior of
which could be seen from the Salles dcs
Fetes, and this was hung vrith priceless
Gobelins* from the Louvre. Into this
Bplendld apartment President Loubet en
tered and walked down the avenue to his
boat. This part of the day's arrangement
was perfect, but the rest was chaos.
The weather to-day was luckily all that
could be desired, 14,000 guests having been
Invited to the function, and they had, be
cause of the fine weather, only the dust
to endure. Had the day been wet. the
unrolled paths of the Exposition grounds
would have been turned into a mass ot
mud.
Congestion of Traffic.
The afternoon was a holiday in Paris
by general consent, and a host of coun
try people crowded Into the city to swell
the multitudes, who from an early hour
surged in the direction of the Exposition
and took up positions along the route
of the Presidential procession and at the
approaches to the grounds. The Immense
number of guests practically swept the
central streets clean of cabs, of which
an unbroken stream,' several deep, drift
ed slowly toward the gates between
noon and 2:30 p. m. Drifted is the cor
rect expression of the rate of progress,
because the traffic arrangements were
so inadequate that hundreds of vehicles
did not reach the Exposition at all, and
the occupants were either left stranded
en route or were obliged to abandon their
carriages and proceed on foot. This was
the expedient .ordinarily adopted, even
by several members of the diplomatic
corps, and two gorgeously attired offi
cials of the Chinese embassy, after has
tily walking â¢ several blocks, arrived In
the Salles dea Fetes Just in time to hear
the charge at tfte conclusion of the cere
mony. ' ; " - - >-.
M. Loubet '.eft the Elyaee in an" op/n
four-horse landau, escorted by a detach
ment of Cuirassiers. The Presidential pro
cession was composed of five landaus, head
ed by the famous outrider Montjarrat. By
the side of President Loubet sat Prime
Minister Waldeck-Rousseau. and their j
progress through the Champs Elysee and
across the Invalides bridge to the Avenue
la Motte picket was hailed with continu
ous cheering from the great crowd which
was massed along the route.
Arrival of the President.
On alighting the President was imme
diately surrounded by the Ministers. M.
Mlllerand, Minister of Commerce, stood at
the entrance to receive him, around M.
Mlllerand being grouped Commissioner
General Plcard and other high exposition
officials. President Loubet shook hands
with M. Mlllerand and then, turning to
Plcard, said he would be happy to sign
his declaration of the Grand Cross of the
Legion of Honor.
President Loubet then saluted the com
mittees " and entered the hall through a
throng of more than 40,000 people that
formed a sea of faces, all turned toward
the door.
" As salutes of artillery announced the
President's arrival there was a moment
of expectant silence; then the heavy red
plush cushions covering the door were
thrown aside and the President, in even-
Ing dress and wearing the broad red In
signia of the Legion of Honor across his
breast, stepped into the tribune which had
been temporarily erected for to-day's cer
emony, the Presidential gallery, which is
to serve for all later ceremonies, not yet
being ready. At the same Instant an or
chestra, composed of musicians of the
famed Republican Guard, struck up the
"Marseillaise." The whole assembly un
covered and remained bareheaded during
the remainder of the proceedings.
"Vive," Cried the People.
Before the strains of France's stirring
national hymn had died away a mighty
cry arose of "Vive Loubet!" "Vive la re
public!" Wive la France!"
President Loubet stood in the front of
the tribune with M. Waldeck-Rousseau,
M. Deschanel. President of the Chamber
of Deputies, and M. Delcasse, Minister of
Foreign Affairs, and all of the Ministers
except the Marquis de Galllfet, Minister
of War, who was absent because of Indis
position.
Grouped behind him were a number of
richly uniformed officials. The acclama
tions were. still echoing through the al
coves and galleries when President Lou
bet and the Ministers resumed their, seats
and M.; Mlllerand began his speech, for
mally handing over the exposition to the
chief of state.
M. Millerand's Oration.
M. Mlllerand said:
The persevering efforts and the passionate
energy of M. Plcard (the Commissioner Gen
era!) and of his colleagues made possible the
prodigious work which I present to you to-day.
One cannot, however, without committing j In
justice, extract, names from the notable list of
artists." engineers and contractors who were
the artisans of these marvels. The universe is
associated with France in this gigantic en
terprise and the government of the republic
fulfills a very pleasant duty of hospitality and
gratitude in expressing its thanks to those sov
ereigns and chiefs of state. The visitor to the

'M. MUlerand's address waa received
with rounds of applause, wblch attained
a veritable roar at its conclusion.
President Loubet then arose and deliv
ered an address which was also warmly
cheered. President Loubet said:

to make us a synthesis of human 'work, tha
French republic had not only In mind to In

MORTALITY DURING THE
SIEGE OF LADYSMITH
Â» Correspondence of the Associated Press.
\ LONDON, April 7.â The Jast days; ln
Ladysmith are described? by. \a Standard
correspondent, * who_, gives isfrom": official
sources â¢ these figures:"" ' " r*^. :.*â¢' ';.
"November 2, when the Investment be
gan, we had a garrison of 572 officers and
12,924 men. On March 1, when the siege
was raised, the garrison was reduced to
400 officers and 9761 men, leaving 169 offi
cers and 3163 men to be accounted for by
death and sickness. When General Bul
ler entered the town there were In hos
pitals 19% officers and men, of whom 708
were suffering from enteric fever, 341
from dysentery and 189 from wounds.
During the four months from November
2 to March 1 no fewer than 10,668 soldiers,
or nearly 70 per' cent of the garrison, had
been admitted Into the hospitals, to say
nothing of civilians and others, who had
slight attacks of what the doctors called
"filth fever," or incipient enteric. The
admissions for enteric fever were 1776 and
for dysentery 1557.
"There died of disease and wounds In
the four months 600 men of the garrison
and 40 civilians, while on the lowest av
erage 140 deaths will probably be record
ed against the patients who remain, rais
ing the total mortality from disease and
wounds to 700 among Europeans alone.
The deaths from enteric fever up to
March were 393, or more than 20 per cent;
from dysentery, 117, or 6 per cent, and
from wounds 59. To this ghastly array of
figures may be added 18 officers and 193
men killed In action: 17 officers and 160
men killed In assaults, sorties and storm
ing parties, and 2 officers and 33 men
killed by casual bombardment. The total
of our dead Is, therefore, not less than
1063. Nor does the list end here, for we
have wounded in assaults and sorties 45
officers and 352 men, and by casual bom
bardment 25 officers and 207 men.
"A siege, like a battle. Is usually a cat
alogue of blunders. After the non-de
struction of the railway came the neg
lect to secure heavy guns and unlimited
ammunition. ,-With the material at com
mand Sir George White could not hope
to maintain an equal duel with the en
emy's batteries of four 9-pounders and
twenty-nine long range guns and how
itzers. The Boers, according to the au
tomatic record of Sir John Wllloughby,
who. with Dr. Jameson, lived In absolute
seclusion in the center of the town, fired
15,500 shells within the perimeter. Our ex
penditure of ammunition did not exceed
4759 rounds, Including 3705 fired by field
guns In action and assaults. The two
4.7 naval guns expended 524 rounds, the
three 12-pounder naval guns 7b4 rounds
and the two. old-fashioned howitzers that
did excellent service fired 776 shells made
thirty years ago."

municipal authorities, presented him with
an . elaborately illuminated address ot
welcome, expressing profound admiration
at his "noble and successful efforts to
uphold and maintain the honor and dig
nity of the empire in distant Natal, which
have won the lasting admiration of the
civilized world." Â¦
A suitable reference was made to Ire
land's connection with the defense ol
Ladysmith, and regret was expressed
that General White's health had been im
paired by the strain of the siege, and that
he had been obliged to seek rest. The ad
dress concluded by expressing the hope
that he . would soon be completely re
stored to health and able to resume the
the- distinguished task with which the
Queen and the country had charged him.
During the reading of the address the
huge crowds in the> vicinity seized every
occasion to hurrah, and the enthusiasm
was Indescribable. Hats, handkerchiefs
and- flags were waved - frantically and
cheer , followed cheer in endless succes
sion. 'General White was visibly movea
at the warmth of his reception. In ac
knowledging the address he referred with
admiration to his gallant garrison, every
one, of whom, he said, "from General

GERMANY AND THE
BOER PEACE ENVOYS
.ROME, April ,l4.^-Nothlng is known here
in corroboration of, the report r published

man Minister of Foreign Affairs^ had vis
ited the Transvaal peace envoy's 1 at Milan,
and the story is not "credited.* The Portu
guese Minister,' Serior Decaryalho Vascon
cellos, however, has gone to that city. .'
An interview, is published here in which
Jonkherr Abram Fischer, r one of .the
Transvaal officials, Is "alleged '^to ;have"de
clared that the South African? republics
were willing to make any 'sacrifice . in or
der to. preserve their liberty *and '4 Inde

ions and the Guards Brigade. He now has
also the Third. Eighth and Eleventh divisions
and expects the. Tenth from Natal, though the
precise destination of the Tenth Is not yet
known. He also has organized a complete di
vision of mounted infantry, under Colonel lan
Hamilton, an officer who enjoys bis full confi
dence. He has also arranged his commands so
as to have for each post a man upon whom he
can rely.
When General Roberts moves this expanded
army it will go easier than the smaller one
with which he started two months ago.
While these preparations have been under
way the Boer raid has come to a standstill.
General Brabant's men under Colonel Dalgety
at Wepener. have apparently punished their as
sailants, and although the report of the Boer
retreat from 'Wepener may be premature it IS
at least probable to forecast that the Boer
raiders have gone Into a cul de sac between
the guarded railway and the Basuto border,
which the Basutos will defend against Invasion.
An extended movement from Bloemfonteln
would menace their retreat. Such a move,
combined with the presence of General Cherm
eide's division at Reddersburg, probably ac
counts for the stoppage of the Boer advance
couth ward. .'*.?Â¦
If the Boers cannct hurt General ; Roberts'
communications they Â¦ can do . him no serious
harm. They must begin to be uneasy about
what he can do to them when he sets out.
The removal of a division from Natal points
to Buller"s operations being confined to the de
fensive until the advance In the western theater
of the war has made Itself felt.
General Lord Methuen's division in front of
Boshof may be covering preparations on the
railway south of Warrenton or in the reelon
between Kimberiey and Bloemfontein, of which
no report has been allowed to come through.
There were stories some weeks ago of a'pro
jected . railway, of which no more has j been
heard. They may have had no foundation, but
it is equally possible that there . is more 13
them than it is convenient "to publish. | General
Roberts knows how to muzzle correspondents
when necessary.
I exoect when General Roberts ' next moves
he will strike at the main Boer army, not nec
essarily by attacking its position, but rather
by such maneuvers as will compel it to fight
at a disadvantage of position as well as iof
numbers. .War of this sort. Is decided not.by
the occupation of territory, but by the destruc
tion of the enemy's armies. This was the
fundamental idea of General . Grant, as it: had
been that of Napoleon, and It is the, keynote
of the present war. because the Boers, like
Napoleon's and Grant's foes, are fighting for
Independence. Nothing: but a crushing out of
their forces will end the war.
GREAT WELCOME GIVEN
GALLANT GENERAL WHITE
LONDON, April 14.â The scene which
greeted General Sir George White when
the steamer Dunvegan Castle, on wGTcb
he left Cape Town on March 2S, reached
Southampton this afternoon must have
convinced him of the admiration of his
countrymen for his gallant defense of
Ladysmith . during the long and trying
siege of that place. From early morn
ing crowds collected by thousands in the
neighborhood of the docka. The buildings
in the vicinity were gayly decorated with
bunting: in honor of the occasion, and all
the public Institutions were covered with
flags. The harbor presented a brilliant
and animated scene, the various vessels
having dressed ship and the Dunvegan
Castle's berth at the wharf being re
splendent with- bunting and evergreens.
Lady White, the Mayor and the members
of the corporation In' their. state robes,
uniformed soldiers and Bailors and a num
ber of privileged guests awaited the gal
lant defender of Ladysmith. As the
steamer loomed in. the distance with
General White standing on the bridge the
enthusiasm of the waiting multitude
broke loose, and ' a storm of cheering' and
LONDON, April 15, sa. m.â There has
been the usual Saturday's absence
of news both from the War Office
and other sources of Information.
The situation in its chief points is
apparently unchanged.
Natives report at Kimberiey that
Colonel Douglas engaged the Boers near
Zwartzkop on Wednesday and succeeded
In driving them back. The British casual
ties were slight.
Elands Laagte last evening reported
that there had been no traces of the Boers
in that neighborhood for the past two
days. Their progress southward has been
effectively barred by the British occupa
tion of Joncr.oskop. on the left, and Um
rmlvranl on the right. The belief that
the Boers' action on Tuesday was due to
restlessness and dissatisfaction In the
ranks Is confirmed by natives, who say
that the Boers have been ready for some
titnÂ© ar.d wanted the British to attack
Them. In order to force this the Boers
commenced shelling, at the same time
tending a force to make a flanking move
ment on the left. The natives also con
firm the statement that one of the Boers'
heavy jruns was put out of action and
the gunners driven off.
The scouts on Saturday located the
Boers in a strong- position eleven miles
northeast of the British advanced posi
tion at Blocmf ontein.
Lord Roberts has strongly protested to
President Kruger against the treatment
of prisoners, sick and wounded, in the
hands of the Boers, and has formally de
manded the observance of thÂ« Geneva
convention.
It appear? from every indication -that
the Boers are preparing:, in the event of
Pretoria being captured, to make a last
Etar.d along a line reaching from Ley
denberg along the mountains into Swazi
land. A traveler recently arrived at
Bloeinfontein Fays that the Boers arc
energetically working to persuade the
Swazis that the British cause Is lost an<l
are seeking to ingratiate themselves,
hoping to secure a footing in Swaziland
peacefully, or to seize hold of the coun
try if necessary. s-Â» .

REVIEWS THE SITUATION
LON*DON, April 13.â Spencer Wilkinson,
reviewing: the situation in South Africa
at midnight for the 'Associated Press,
cay?:
"*\> tr.ay hay* tn wait a few days before Gen
eral Roberts opens his new campaign, hiÂ« prin
ciple being never to start until all Is ready.
There Is no doubt now that he has been wait
ing for horses. About COOO horses reached Cape
Town this wwk an<J DGOO are due there next
\reek. W*, at this end. however, do not know
how the tray now 6tan<!s in the matter of re-
ZttOURtS.
The rw>pral r>o*ition now may bent be
fathered from a Fhort retrospect. Lord Uob
*Tts reached Bloemfonteln en March 13. the
army being: tired out with heavy inarches and
the horses for the most part ruined. He opened
the railway couth and settled down to rest and
refit his horses. The Boers within about a
fortnight had recovered their detachments from
further south and had regained their spirits.
On the 23th General Roberts had to push them
back from Karee Elding and about the same
time the Boers ret out on a bis raid south, be
gtar.iryr with the rurprlse at Eannas Post,
Â¦where they took a Uritish convoy on March tV
On April 4 the nrcrs effected a second surprise
end captured Redden-burg. Soon after this
they were attacking part of General Brabant's
division near Wepener. General Roberts was
not ready for a movement and he would not
be drawn Into any action. He took steps, how
| ever. Â«o puard his railway. That these were

Loubet descended from the tribune.
A detachment of Republican Guards
then hied in and lined the passage across
the hall to the grand staircase at the op
posite side on which was ranged a dou
ble line of Republican Guards. The Pres
ident made his way across the hall amid
a renewed storm of cheering, ascended the
staircase of honor and entered 'the recep
tion hall, where the ceremony of the pre
sentation of foreign Commissioners was
gone through with. The President and
his party then proceeded to a tour of the
grounds.
Cheered by . Americans.
A momentary stop was made In the gal
lery of the agricultural building, where
the President secured his first view of the
interior of any of the exposition build
ings. The outlook across the vast area
was disappointing in that the ground
space was tilled with debris and the In
stallation of exhibits barely under way.
Passing* through the interior of the struc
ture, the Salon d'Ponneur was inspected
and the party emerged into the open air
in the Champs de Mars. From the top
of the broad stretch of ground extending
from the Chateau d'Eau, across the
d'lena bridge to the Troadero, the sight
was an inspiring and .brilliant one.
Soldiers lined both sides of the railroad,
saluting the Presidential party as it
passed. Military bands stationed at close
Intervals made the echoes of the "Mar.
sellalse" reverberate from buildtng to
building, while the crowds which lined
the walks back of the soldiers waved
hands, handkerchiefs and hats as Presi
dent Loubet passed along. Here and
there some raised cries of "Vive Loubet"
and "Vive la Republique." The bridge
d'lena was crossed and at the other end
gayly festooned barges awaited. To the
booming of cannon and tho cheers of the
spectators President Loubet, tho Minis
ters, the diplomatic corps and distin
guished guests embarked, and preceded by
a small naval tug started up the Seine to
ward the bridge Alexander 111. Though
the right bank of the Seine contained
many interesting structures, those in the
Presidential barges gave most attention to
the left bank, along which are the build
ings of the various nations. Each nation
has made an effort to outdo the others in
the homage paid the Presidential barge as
It steamed slowly along. Before each na
tional pavilion the legation staffs had
gathered with their friends.
President Loubet stood in the stern
watching interestedly the architectural
accomplishments which the countries of
the world had presented aa a portion of
their exhibit. . ' ... â¢'
At the United States pavilion many
guests were assembled, and they cheered
while the Stars and .Stripes were dipped
on one flagpole while the French tricolor
wasa lowered from another. At the ' Ale

structure officially opened, and then, land-
Ing, the party proceeded through the
magnillcent Avenue Nicholas II to the
gate of the Champa Elysees, -where state
carriages were taken to the palace. Thus
the ceremony came to an end and the
crowds dispersed to their homes.
Praise the Big Show.
General Horace Porter, United States
Embassador, after the inaugural cere
mony, said to a representative of the As
sociated Press:
The present French exposition will attract
even greater' Interest than any previous effort
made in Paris to display before the world the

ENGLISH PRESS
CRITICIZES THE
ARMY OFFICERS
Conservative Organs Cry
Out for a New and
Better System.
Couragu Is Admittted by All, but
Leaders Are Accused of Careless-*
ness, Negligence and
Stupidity.
Copyrighted. 1500, by the Associated. Prew.
LONDON. April 14.â The unsatisfactory
turn that has recently marked the cam
paign against the Boers is resulting in
astonishing and sweeping criticisms by
the English papers of their own army
methods. When Buller struck snags in
Natal, when General Methuen and General
Gatacre made terrible mistakes, and be
fore the British arms had secured any
progress a somewhat similar wave swept
over the press. But then it was directed
at individuals and chiefly confined to pa
pers which were willing to condescend to
"slang" one or several generals. Now
names are not mentioned, but there is
widespread, deeply rooted conviction that
the method of selection of British army
officers is altogether wrong. About this
conviction there is no bitterness, nor is
it based upon conclusions rapidly arrived
at. "Our officers," says the conservative,
common-sense Outlook, "are as brave as
lions, but as. a rule they are stupid."
"The warmest champions of our regi
mental orileers," says the Saturday Re
view, "are beginning sorrowfully to admit
that their courage oxten makes them care
less and when not negligent they some
times show themselves ignorant of their
business."
Vanity Fair, which formerly denounced
vigorously any sucn forms of criticism,
admits borrowfully thai "our officers
seem to play at war rattier than to carry
on war. It is all -wrong." Â¦
Referring to a much commented on let
ter written by Colonel l.onsdale Hale to
the limes on this subject, in which
Colonel Hale declares that the constant
mental strain and incessant carefulness*
becomes unbearable. Vanity Fair says:
"What of the strain that a naval onleer
nas to bear when he knows his ship may
be torpedoed at any moment? American
naval officers have borne the strain well
Cannot our English soldiers bear less?"
The paper concludes by advocating that
army officers be treated with, the same
discipline and training as naval olficers.
Military Schools Needed.
The Saturday Review advocates good
military schools and reform at Sandhurst
The Outlook urges that the navy methods
be applied to the army, which, it is de
clared, is little better than' a social club.
But beneath these outcries against indi
vidual incompetence and lack of brains on
tHe part of army otflcers, which, since tho
war began has been constantly causing the
lass of detachments and positions, and
especially during the last fortnight, there
is an underlying and sometimes expressed
determination that England's army must
not longer be oincered by men whose
claims to commissions rest almost solely
on birth and money. In other words, the
army must be so changed that an olficer
can live on his pay, and \hus attract to
its rank that hardiest element of the race
the young man who relies upon brains
alone to make his way in the world.
This is not the result of agitation by a
demagogic press or the less influential sec
tion of the public. It Is an almost unani
mous deduction drawn from lessons of the'
present war by papers controlled in many
cases by aristocrats, by organs that are
notoriously reluctant to lend their influ
ence to popular movements and by the
keenest and most unbiased students of
national Institutions, Including members
of the Cabinet Itself.
The untoward circumstances which
have brought such radical defects In the
system into prominence are doubtless
themselves exiggerated in English public
opinion, though this fact will not lessen
the good effects of the agitation referred
to.
The premature self-congratulation over
the occupation of Bloemfonteln has had a
reaction somewhat similar to that which
followed the iir?t victories in Natal. As
the Saturday Review says, "Too soon did
we congratulate ourselves Â«n the posses
sion of Bloemfonteln, and too little did we
realize that the possession of such a capi
tal does not Imply much." It then pro
ceeds to instance the capture of Philadel
phia by the British In the war for inde
pendence, showing Us uselessness and
eventual evacuation.
Dewey in English Eyes.
Not a little interest is beginning to l,e
taken In England In politics In the United
States. Admiral Dewey's candidacy is re
garded rather more humorously than hi
any other light, tho popularity of the ad
miral having never been quite understood
In England nor his achievements thor
oughly appreciated by the naval or lay
circles, whose attention haa always been
more confined to our naval operations in
the West Indies than in Manila.
The Spectator, which so often voices
Government opinion, has a lengthy and
important editorial on the relations in the
immediate future between America and
Great Britain during which it says in
part:
"The British people will have to krep
their tempers for the next few months
when they consider American affairs?. By
rather an odd series of circumstances it
happens that the pivot of the next election
will be the relation of the United States
and Great Britain and, of course. In the
frenzy of campaign very hard things will
be said. Air. Bryan and his supporters
will, perhaps, pass resolutions in- the
Democratic convention culling upon the
Government to intervene strongly In be
half of President Kruger, who either by
instinct or craftiness always appeals to
them through literature which they 'know
bestâ the Old Testament. Wo shall have
a shower of hard words from their side
and maybe even difficult and perplexed
argument to maintain through Lord
Paunccfote.
McKinley's Prospective Attitude.
"And, too, we shall not be very strenu
ously defended by the Republicans. Pres
ident McKinley will persist in his policy
and carry his party with him, but still he
is the American candidate for the Presi
dency, and cannot bear, with the second
term at stake, to lose a vote. â¢ McKinley.
therefore, and the Republican leaders, will
do nothing to show themselves- friends of
Great Britain. They will utter , no plain
protest against the chorus, of Ignorant
denunciation, and will view, with dismay
any appearance on this side of any hearty
wish for Republican success. We must,
however, possess our souls in patience and
receive American censure with that dogged
stolidity with which we receive censure
from the remainder of the world. The
electoral campaign will come to an end,
and with It most of the attacks upon
Grrat Britain. The better opinion In the'
United" States,. Including, we believe, a
majority of the population. Is upon tho
whole friendly to us and fully convinced
that all the world over British and Amer
ican interests are the same. Neither na
tion desires anything except to trade in
peace. Of one thing we may be sure:
the Americans will not caricatures the
Queen. In the fiercest of their electoral
battles they will respect the aged lady
who forty years ago was on their side in
the civil war and who is now the only
monarch In Europe who watches their
prosperity with ungrudging pleasure and
without the idea that their growth, wealth
and influence is a menace to the world."
This article voices better than anything
that has. recently appeared the tone
toward America held by British Govern
ment officials and by those who are serl-

FRENCH WAS FOILED
BY A FEW RIFLEMEN
Correspondence of the Associated Press.
LONDON, April 7.â General French, in
trying to intercept the main body of
Boers In their retreat at Poplar Grove,
was foiled by a few riflemen. A Dally
News correspondent describes how this
came about:
"About 6000 yards from the square
kopje at Dreifonteln a three-inch creusot
and a Vickers-Maxim opened fire on our
advance. A great many shells were
thrown. We. however, suffered no loss,
the enemy was moving while Wa were held
and got off his guns and stores. A most
gallant stand, brilliantly executed.
"We had the chagrin of watching from
the disputed ridge the distant retirement
of the Boer convoy. Xot till next day did
we hear that President Kniger had been
present at the battle and that we might
have even captured him and brought the
war to a sudden end but for the ill starred
contraction of our right wing, which In
dealing with an enemy of such mobility
as the Boers was on much too short a
radius and which had no justification In
any effort on tha part of the enemy to
break through our center, who. on tha
contrary, throughout the day consistently
rallied on his left, actually outfianlctns
our contracted right between 9 and 10 a.

not acceptable to the Government In view
of the fact that It would surely precipi

cifferences with other powers, besides un
duly increasing tbÂ« price of "one of the
most necessary nutriments both for high

SCENES IN THE
BURGHER CAMPS
ON THE VELDT
How the Boer Patriots
Prepare Their Simple
Laagers.
Many Women Accompany Each Com
mando to Care for the
Wounded and Comfort
the Dying.
Correspondence of the Associated Presa.
LONDON, April 7.â A. C. Hales, the
Australian correspondent, who was cap*
tured by the Boers and released by- Pres
ident Steyn, writing from Burghersdorp
to the Dally News says:
"Many and wonderful are the stories
written and published concerning thÂ»
Boer and his habits when on the war
path. Most of these stories are written
by men who take good care never to get
within a hundred miles of the fighting
line, but content themselves with an easy
chair, a cigar, a bottle of whisky and
carpet slippers on the stoop of some
good hotel In a pretty little Boer town.
"Possibly It may interest English
mm- and women, too, for that matter-*
to know what a fighting laager is like,
and, as I have seen half a dozen of them
on the enemy's side of the wall, a rough
pen and ink sketch may not be amiss.
In war times ..he Boer never under any
circumstances makes his laager In the
open country if there are any kopjes
about. No matter how seeuie he Utd.y
fancy himself from attack, no matter
if there is not a foe within fifty miles
of him, the Boer commander always
pitches his laager In a place of safety
between two parallel lines of hills, so that
an attack cannot be made upon him.
either front or rear, without giving him
an immense advantage over the attack-
Ing force, even if the enemy is ten times
as strong in numbers. By this means
the Boers make their laagers almost im
pregnable. If they have a choice or
ground they pick a narrow ravine or
gully, with a line of hills, front and rear,
covered by small," rocky boulders and
bushes. They drive their wagons in be
tween these hills.
Many Women With the Warriors.
"The women are placed in safetyâ for it
is a noticeable fact that very large num
bers of women have followed their hus
bands and brothers to the war not to
handle the rifle but to nurse the wounded,
to comfort the dying and to lay out the
dead. 1 have hoard them singing round
the camphrea in the starlight, out it was
hymns that they sang, not ribald songs.
1 have seen them kretllng by the side of
men in the moonlightâ noi in wantonness
but In mercyâ and many a man who wears
the British uniform to-day can bear me
witness that 1 speak the truth.
"The Boer never if he can help it allows
himself to be separated from his horse,
and these hardy little animals, mostly
about fifteen hands high and very lightly
framed, are picketed close to the spot
where the rider deposits his rifle and
blankets. If the Boers allow them to
praze on the hillsides during the day they
run a rope through the hultt-r near thÂ»*
horse's muzzle and tie it close above the
knee Joint of the near fore leg. L'y this
means the horse can graze In comfort,
but cannot move away at any pace be
yond a slow walk, and so is easily caught
and saddled if required in a hurry. Tht.
oxen and sheep to be used for slaughter
ing purposes are driven up close to the
camp; a wagon or two Is drawn across
the ravine above and below them, ana
they then cannot stampede if frightened
by any thing, unless they climb the rocky
heights on either side of them, which they
have email chance of doing, a* the Kaffir
herdsmen sleep on the hills above them
"Having pitched his laager, the soldier
sends out his scouts. Some amble off on
horseback at a pace they call a 'trifle'â
a salt which all the Boers educate their
nags to adopt. It is no exactly an amble,
but a cousin to it, marveloualy easy to the
rider, while it enable* the nag to get
over a wonderful lot of ground without
tiring.. It also allows the horse to pick its
way among the rocky ground and to pave
his legs, where an English, Indian or Aus
tralian horse would be apt to cripple him
self in a very short time. .
Boer Sentries Never Sleep.
"As soon as the mounted scouts get off
on their Journey, holding the reins care
lessly In the left hand, their handy little
Mauser rifles In their, right, swaying care
lessly in the saddle after the fashion of
all bush riders the world over, the foot
scouts take up their position among the
rocks and shrubs on the hills In front and
rear of the laager. Each scout has his
rifle In his hand, his pipe in hts teeth, his
bandolier full of cartridges over his shoul
der, and his scanty blanket under his left
arm. No fear of him sleeping at hln
post. He is fighting for honor, not for
pay: for home, not for glory, and he
knows that on his acutcness the lives of
all may depend. He knows that his com
rades and the women trust him, and he
values the trust as dearly an British sol
diers ever did. No matter how tired he
may be. no matter how famished, the
Boer sentinel is never faithless to his
orders.
When the scouts are out the laager is
fixed for the nightâ not a very exhaustive
proceeding, as the Boers don't go in for
luxuries of any kind. Here a tarpaulin
in stretched over a kind of temporary
ridgÂ« pole, blankets are tossed down *>n
the hard earth, saddles are used for pil
lows, and the couch is complete. A little
way further down the line a rude canvas
screen is thrown over the wheels of a
wagon- and a familyâ or. rather, husband
and wife â make themselves at home under
the wajron. while the single men simply
throw themselves at full length on the.
ground, wrap their ono thin, small blan
ket around them, and smoko and lest
merrily enough, while the Kaffirs- light

It used to bs considered that only urinary and bladder trou-
bles were to be traced to the kidneys, but now modern science
proves that nearly all diseases have their bsgtnning in tho dis-
order of these most Important organs.
The kidneys filter and purify the blood â that is their work.
So when your kidneys are weak or out of order, you can
understand how quickly your entire body is affected, and how
every organ seems to fail to do its duty.
If you arc sick or â¢â¢feel badly." begin taking the new dis-
covery, Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root, because as soon as your kid-
neys ars well they will help all tho other organs to health. A

the best proof of this is a trial.
Weak and unhealthy kidneys are reÂ»
sponsible for more sickness and suffer-
ing than any other disease, and if per-
mitted to continue fatal results are

the nerves, makes you dizzy, restless,
sleepless and irritable. Makes you pass
water often during the day and obliges
you to get iip many times during the
night. Causes puffy or dark circles un-

ambition, but no strength; get weak
and waste away.
If your water when allowed to remain
undisturbed in a glass or bottle for
twenty-four hours forms a sediment or
settling or has a cloudy appearance, or
If small particles float about in it. it is
evidence that your kidneys and bladder
need immediate attention.
Swamp-Root Is the great discovery of
the eminent kidney specialist, Dr. Kil-
mer, and is used in the leading hos-
pitals, recommended by skillful physi-
cians in their private practice and is

nize in it the greatest and most suc-
cessful remedy for kidney and bladder

STRANGE STORY
OF CRIME TOLD
BY A YOUTH
George .Wilson Says He
Murdered a Tramp for
His Money.
Also Claims That He Called an Oak
land Man to His Door Last Fall
and Struck Him "With
a Hatchet.
Special IMspatch to The Call
LOS ANGELES, April 14.â Details of
the confession made by George Wilson,
the boy desperado Imprisoned in the
County Jail, have Just been made public.
The story he tells is startling and if true
clears up several mysteries which have
beeen puzzling authorities all over Cali
fornia.
Wilson claims it was he who murdered
the old tramp found with a crushed skull
at Whlttler, and confesses to having been
the perpetrator of the mysterious assault
on an Oakland householder. Both crimes
have up to this time been impenetrable
mysteries. Even the identity of the mur
dered tramp has not been ascertained.
- He had been hanging around Whlttier
for several months and seemed <to be a
morose and unsociable but perfectly
harmless old vagabond. One morning
laÂ«t winter he was found dead under a
bridge which crosses the San Gabriel
River on the outskirts of the town. His
head had been smashed in with a blunt
instrument. The Sheriff's office was at
work on the case for some time, but
no clew to the perpetrator of the deed was
Young Wilson claims he killed the old
man in the night time for $5 25 that he
carried. He rays he hit him on the head
with a club and describes with consider
able zest the manner in which the blood
gushed out and spurted from the death
wounds of the poor old man.
The Oakland police will long remember
the mysterious assault which Wilson con
fesses to have committed. One night last
fall an Oakland man was called to hia
front door nt a late hour by a determined
rapping. He opened the door, and had
hardly time to maka out the indistinct
figure of a man when he was struck a
hard blow in the face with a hatchet. His
nssallant fled Into the night. Wilson says
he was the assailant.
W. J. Bryan delivered two addresses to
large audiences in Albuquerque to-day.
He leaves at midnight for El Paso. Tex.
Mr. Bryan said to-day that eight States
had authorized the delegates to the Kan
sas City convention to vote for his r.om
lnatioQ for the Presidency. In response
to a question, he said that he believed It
was right for delegates to go to the con
vention Instructed, and if he were nom
inated he wanted to be nominated by del
egates who were acting for the people.

ENCOURAGING REPORTS
TO LEAGUE COMMITTEE
Large Attendance at the Convention
of Republican Clubs Is Now-
Assured.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, April 14.â The executive
committee of the California League of Re
publican Clubs met thl3 evening. Colonel
George Stone, president of the State
League, presided. The committee heard
reports from all sources. That a large
attendance of delegates may be expected
was demonstrated by the enthusiasm
manifested in the newspapers of the State.
The executive committee, while urging
party organization and the formation of
clubs, laid particular stress upon the low
rates to Los Angeles during the conven
tion week from all parts of the State.
The tickets north of Elwood and Mojave
are now on sale under the certificate plan,
and It Is expected that by the middle of
next week the influx of visitors will be
gin. One feature that will aid in swelling
the crowd during convention week is that
these tickets also apply to the Knights
Templar of California, who will hold their
conclave a few days before the convention
meets. The two gatherings, occurring
during the same week, will serve to bring
thousands of prominent citizens from all
parts of the State to Los Angeles.
The committee is much pleased with the
financial showing that has been made.
Without regard to party citizens have
promptly responded with subscriptions, as
they realize that while this may be a Re
publican convention, the benefits to be de
rived will inu.re to the reputation of Lis
Angeles as a convention city; hence the
committee will be enabled to aid the mer
chants and others who will decorate by
adding several designs and a display of
bunting. This morning's mall brought In
scores of answers to the invitations to at
tend the convention that had been sent to
all of the prominent party workers and
citizens throughout the State and nation.
Their answers indicate that they are in
full sympathy with the movement of the
Republican League Clubs and that they
share the enthusiasm which is manifested
in endeavoring to make this one of the
most important gatherings in the history
of the league.

Special Dispatch to the Â«JalL
CHICAGO. April 14.â A Washington special to the Inter Ocean says: The
Dewey XBJp&XT is explained at last. The reason for the admiral's sudden an
nouncement of hlmsolf as a Presidential candidate and his bitter feeling to
vard McKir.k-y are cleared up by a discovery made to-day.
Adrniial Dewejf furnished a clew to the explanation by complaining to
friends tjjftti Mr. McKinley unjustly deprived him of 510,000. In the admiral's
opinion the President "robbed him."
The fcavis Tor tlv; charge is the fact that President McKinley has been
ur.abie to pay Admiral Dewey the same compensation as that received by civil
ian members of the late Philippine Commission, to wit, $10,000. The President
â¢wanted to pay this sum to the admiral, but the law would not permit. That
section of the statute which says no one shall hold two offices of trust and
profit under th* United States Government, where the compensation exceeds
J2SOO. was in the way. and though tnÂ© President tried to find a way around the
statute nether he nor his law officers were able to do so, and Dewey cannot
have his $10,030.
A month ago Dewey called at the White House and asked Mr. McKinley
about compensation for his services as a member of the commission. The
President told him he wanted to pay him the same as other civilian members
were to receive.
Dewey then volunteered to the President the statement that, in his opin
ion, there was but one candidate for President in this countryâ that there
should be but oneâ McKinley.
"Ton have earned election and the people will give it to you," the admiral
ttli.
DeToey then went on to say tnat he had always been a Republican: that
ne was originally a Republican on the slavery issue, was afterward a Repub
lican on protection, then on the money question, and was now a Republican
on expansion. He thanked thÂ« President for all past kindnesses and went
away In a .happy frame of mind. A few days later he started on his tour
through the South.
When Dewey returned from his Southern trip the first thing he heard at
the office of the Secretary of the Navy was that the law would not permit
hlra to draw SIO.OOO compensation. The admiral lost his temper. He swore at
the President in a most bitter way. He paced the floor of the room, ex
claiming that llcKinley had robbed him, had deprived him of his just dues,
had treated hfrn like a &0%, had trumped up this legal obstacle for the pur
pose of cheating and robbing him.
Incredible as it may appear, these were his expressions. He apparently
could riot find words vicious enough to express his feelings.
The admiral declared he would have vengeance, and 'ln a day or two not
only the people of the country, but Dewey's most Intimate friends, were
amazed and surprised at his announcement that he was a candidate for
President- From that day to this the admiral has been complaining of Mc-
Kinley and of the administration in general, and. through his fault finding,
the first information concerning the matter leaked out.
An investigation In administration circles discloses great unwillingness to
ta!k about the case. It is not denied the President refused to pay Dewey
thÂ« sum paid to orher members of the commission, but Mr. McKinley has
Issued orders that not one word be said about the affair by any oC his ad
visers.

CALL HEADQUARTERS. WELLING
TON' HOTEL/WASHINGTON. April 14.â
Republicans- and Democrats . here have
ceased their attempt to ridicule the can
didacy of Admiral Dewey and are
now seriously considering what his
Presidential prospects are and what ef
fect hia candidacy will have on the move
ment lv behalf of McKinley and Bryan.
Perry Belmont, who has declared his
Intention to support the cause of the ad
miral, says the sentiment In favor of
Dewey Is daily increasing, and the more
the subject is agitated the stronger It
grows. It is pretty well understood that
Mr. Belmont has confidence in Admiral
Dewey, and is being freely consulted as
to his political tactics.
While Mr. Belmont is here the admiral
will promulgate the statement In which
he will clearly define his present posi
tion. Immediately after this statement is
issued friends of the admiral in all parts
of the country will be consulted as to the
time and place for holding a general con
ference to decide whether it will be ad
visabU- to hold an Independent conven*
tion or depend upon the popularity of the
admiral to capture the Kansas City con
vention. Snapshot forecasts of Admiral
Dewey's expected platform are being
made.
The latest forecast relegates the money
question to the rearÂ«Â»Lnd suggests mid
dle ground for the Philippine prob
lem â a vague position somewhere between
the McKinley plan of holding on and the
Bryan proposition of letting go. Practi
cal men in Congress do not take readily
to such a course, regarded either from a
political view or one of statesmanship.
Representative Livingstone of Georgia
voiced the sentiments of a large element
In the Democratic party to-day.
"We must stick or quit." he sal<3.
"There Is no middle ground. The Soutn
is not willing to relinquish sovereignty
over the Philippines. We want to see the
people given a wide measure of self-gov
ernment, of course, but no backing out
from the task ahead of us."
Representative Dalzell of Pennsylvania
expressed the sentiments of the Republi
cans. "There Is no middle ground policy
for Admiral Dewey," he Bald. "He will
have no following on an uncertain policy.
But, then, I don't think he Is a figure In
the situation, anyhow."

SAN QUENTIN PRISON, April 14.â ThÂ«
meeting of tho State Board of Prison Di
rectors held to-day was devoid of any
sensational features, the principal busi
ness to occupy the board's attention beinsr
passing on quarterly bills and reports.
Expert Accountant I. \V. Wadham pre
sented a financial report for the quarter.
Wadham states that he has made a trial
balance of the prison books and found
them correct In every particular. This is
by far the largest quarterly report that
has ever left the prison. There la pris
oners' cash on hand to the amount of
$3000. Tho available funds on hand for
tho balance of tho fifty-first fiscal year
are as follows: General appropriation for
support, {33,596 09; for salaries, $20,00125;
State prison fund, $164,310 19. Total, $217,
907 53, less March bills $15,744 86. less pay
roll $7454 98. Total available fund.'sl94,

ing fund, which may be used in purchase
of law jute.
Warden Agulrre's report sets forth that
all the new laundry machinery has been
received and will be In running order b>
Monday. The cost of the telephone sys
tem lately installed at the prison amounts
to $118 05. The spindles used for the spin
ning frames obtained from Eastern firms
*re stated to be very inferior to thos*
originally furnished, and Fair bairn, Nay
lor & Co., the original makers of trie ma
chinery, will furnish the prison with aou
new spindles.
The Jute mill Is now in full operation
and is turning out 15,twu bags per day. The
aeiailed report is as follows: Grain bags
carried over on orders from last year,
41b,0tw; sold since January 1, 1900, 2,877,130;
shipped since January 1, 9lu0; sold await

1. Seven thousand bales are contracted
for and will arrive shortly.
There will be a reduction of 50 cents per
ton made on the coal furnished theprlson In
accordance with a contract entered into
at the time it was ordered. C. K. Allen,
representative of the Pittsburg Coal Com
pany, stated that he was satisfied that
the coal did not come up to the promised
standard, and on behalr of his company
passed in the discount. This deduction
will make a difference of $2^5 per month
in the prison coal bills.
A communication from Judge S. K.
Dougherty of Santa Rosa was presented
to the board. The communication seta
forth that Joe and John Bryan, two broth
ers, were sentenced by him to serve
twenty years each for burglary, one in
Folsom and one in San Quentin, his idea
in separating them being to keep them
from planning any further schemes.
Judge Dougherty goes on to state that
tho necessity for separation now having
passed he would ask that the one con
fined in Folsom be transferred to San
Quentin, as to see the boys occasionally
is the sole comfort of their aged mother.
The mother resides at Petaluma, nnd an
occasional visit to San Quentin Is possi
ble to her, while Folsom Is rendered by
its distance -almost impossible for her to
reach.
A. Drahms, the prison chaplain, request
ed leave of absence to attend tho conven
tion of the National Prison Association
in Cleveland during next August. His
request was granted by the board.
C R. Hoessli of Colusa County appeared
before the board to ask for a parole for
John" Ashley, doing eight years for man
slaughter from Princetown, in that
county. His request was contested by S.
Millington, an attorney, who assisted in
Ashley's prosecution. Millington spoke
strongly on the subject and stated that
the parole system was one of the great
est fosterers of crime that exists. Both
applicants lodged written statements for
the board's consideration.

Batting and Base-Bunning of the

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, April 14.â
The second of the intercollegiate series of
baseball games was won by the cardinal
amid one ofthe most exciting scenes ever
seen on the' Stanford campus. With the
score 10 to 7 in favor of the home team
and Berkeley at the bat with two outs
and three men on bases Hamlin batted
out to Murphy in center field, who ac
cepted the chance and won the game for
Stanford.
Stanford came first to bat and struck a
winning pace, scoring seven runs before
being retired. Though the Bcore contin
ued in their favor it looked several times
as if California would pass them and so
close the contest. The steadiness of Lan
agan, who struck out twelve men to his
opponent's two, really was the deciding
feature of the game. Kaarsburg was given
excellent support by his team, but was
batted freely, allowing nine hits and giv
ing three bases on balls.
Stanford's batting and base-running was
especially noticeable. Brown, on second,
allowed California two runs on as many
errors in the seventh inning.
The game as a whole was an improve
ment on that played at Berkeley last Sat
urday, both teams making fewer errors
and holding well together throughout.
The deciding game of the series will be
played in San Francisco April 28. Follow

CLAIMS THAT
HE IS CHINA'S
REAL EMPEROR
Strange Story Told to Offi
cials by a Prisoner at
Chiangshia.
Shows Documents to Support His
Statements and Says That Friends
Will Back Him by Force
of Arms.
Â£cecial Dispatch to The CalL
VICTORIA. B. C, April 14.â A strange
story comes by the Rlojun Maru of a Chi
nese prisoner who. when he had been
beaten and tortured in the yamen of the
magistrate at Chlangshla, terrorized the
officials by the declaration that he was
their Emperor, who had escaped from the
palace at Peking and was traveling incog
nito through China when he had been ar
rested. The stories of- this illustrious pris
oner, who has sealed credentials, are ro
mantic. The Wuchang correspondent of
the North China Daily News tells the
story, as follows:
"Two years ago, when the Emperor con
sulted with the Dowager about the advisa
bility- of adopting European dress, that
august lady was very irate and upbraided
her Imperial nephew and Kang Yu-\Vel
In no unmeasured terms. In consequence
the Emperor gave Kang Tu-Wel strict or
ders to flee from Peking. When the Em
press found he had escaped she vented her
wrath upon the Emperor. He was Im
prisoned in one of the palaces and given
some harmful potion. In this extremity
he begged some of the eunuchs to let him
escape. They did so, and in consequence
three of them were executed by their en
raged mistress. The Emperor, sick of life,
betook himself to a monastery in Szec
huan, intending to renounce forever a
worldly pomp and ambition. However, he
apparently found it hard to keep his se
cret, and by degrees his history became
known to his companions. In the course
of time he found his way to Wuchang
and succeeded in making many believe
that he really was the Emperor. Among
others who have visited him and are con
vinced of the truth of his claims is the
chief of the police force in Hankow.
"A few weeks ago he was examined by
the Wuchang Prefect and by him handed
over to the Chiangshla magistrate. Up to
the present the highest officials prudently
avoided meeting or examining him. fear
ing that his claims may prove to be true.
The Prefect treated him with marked re
spect, but the magistrate had him beaten.
He sent a dispatch to the Viceroy, in
which he stated that the so-styled Em
peror is really an arch traitor of the same
gang as Kang Yu-Wel, and that he has
numerous friends who supply him with
money and who are prepared to support
his pretensions with arms. The magis
trate urges the Viceroy to have him exe
cuted at once before trouble arises. It Is
said that this dispatch is an invention of
the magistrate's. He ordered one of his
underlings to alter the prisoner's state
ments, but he declined, whereupon the
magistrate himself did so.
"Be this as it may. it is certain that the
Viceroy is going to meet and examine the
prisoner in person, and has put out a
proclamation stating that he hears he is a
baa character. Nearly all the people be
lieve he is the Emperor. His lack of
proofs, outside of a few papers, is ac
counted for by the robbers of Szechu hav
ing stolen them, among others a Jade seal.
The man knows a little English, he speaks
with a Pekinese dialect and shows con
siderable acquaintance with the court of
Peking and Kang Yu-Wel.

SULTAN CONTINUES
TO DEFY AMERICA
Breaks All His Promises to Pay In-
demnity for Attacks Upon
Missionaries.
WASHINGTON. April 14.â 1t Is learned
on undoubted authority that the negotia
tions for the payment of Indemnity de
manded for the destruction of American
missionary property in Turkey during
the Armenian massacres In 1595 have
reached their logical conclusion. Minister
Strauss had secured the promise of the
Sultan that indemnity amounting to
about $90,000 should be paid, and that
promise had been twice renewed, the last
time previous to Minister Strauss' de
parture from Constantinople, when it was
understood by the Minister as well as by
the State Department that payment
would be forthcoming.
Sixteen months have passed since the
promise was made, and it has not yet
been fulfilled, and - the question presents
itself: What action will this Govern
ment take -to enforce Its observance?
Meanwhile, the. President has refused to
would have presided, was not present, nor
was Director Rockhlll of the bureau.
There was purpose in their absence, it Is
assumed, for it is regarded as desirable
that the representatives of these southern
republics shall not be under the slightest
appearance of influence from the Wash
ington Government in the pending matter.
The members of the conference spent
fully an hour and a half in close consul
tation. Senor Calvo, the senior member
of the executive committee of the bureau,
presided, and the outcome of the meeting
was- the agreement of the members upon
a proposition that the executive commit
tee of the bureau should be charged with'
drawing up a tentative programme for the
proposed international congress. This
programme will.be submitted by the Min
isters to their respective Governments for
approval and amendment. In this manner
will be avoided a mistake made by the
Btate Department is arranging for the
first Pan-American Congress. The United
States Government itself In that case sub
mitted to the various Governments in
vited to participate in the congress a com
plete programme for the government of
the body; nothing was left for the other
nations to do but to accept the whole or
decline to participate. Under the new
order, the United States .. effaces itself,

MERRIAM CLAIMED
HE WAS MISQUOTED
Objected to Criminal Organizations
and Not to Labor
Unions.
WASHINGTON, April 14.-Conner Ma
lon continued his testimony to-day before
the Coeur d'Alene investigation. He said
he was present at a private meeting at
Wardner, calle-d by business men with a
view to committing General Merriam to a
permanent establishment of martial law
in the Coeur d'Alenes. General Merriam
stated at the meeting, however, that he
was unalterably opposed to such a per
manent policy â that it would amount to
taking a section out of the State and
placing it under Federal jurisdiction, and
that the State should assume full control
of affairs at the earliest possible moment.
It was the witness' understanding at
the time that General Merriam stated
that Congress ehould enact laws making
membership in unions a crime. He had
;o leported to his paper, the Spokane Re
view, but subsequently General Merriam
had pointed out that his language had
been misconstrued.- It was the witness'
understanding that General Merriam
stated that organizations of a criminal
character should be reached by Congress.
It was General Merrlam's version of the
etatpment. thÂ«Â» witness said, that his ob
jection was not to unions, but to criminal
arts which they might resort to. No
shorthand notes of General Merriam's
Statements were taken, but a condensed
quotation of his remarks was made. The
whole purport of General Merriam's re
marks, the witness said at another point,
was against the alleged criminal organiza
tions which had developed in the Coeur
d'Alenes. and not against labor organiza
tions in general.
ALEXANDER WAS A THIEF.
Stolen Articles Found Among the Ef
fects of the Dead Man.
SUXSUN. April 14.â W. H. Alexander,
who brutally murdered his wife in St. He
lena and afterward committed suicide,
xvas a notorious character. He formerly
lived in Euisun under the name of John
eon, and his manner of obtaining & live
lihood was a mysterious one. He left
Fuisun two years ago and located at St.
Helena. During this time several persons
have occasionally reported that sets of
harness and saddles were stolen from
their places. The acts of thievery oc
curred repeatedly, and to Constable
Downing is due credit for having solved
the mystery of the depredations.
He suspected Alexander and went to St.
Helena yesterday. Among the man's ef
fects he found various articles which
were Identified as having been stolen from
Suisun and vicinity. The young son* of
the murdered woman stated that Alexan
der made occasional trips for the purpose
of stealing. There is no doubt now but
that the St. Helena assassin was respon
sible for several criminal acts committed
Sn the vicinity of St. Helena and Suisun.

FIRE DAMAGES
THE CLUBHOUSE
AT DEL MONTE
Firemen Save the Bowling
Alleys and Wine
Cellar.
As the Building Stood Some Distance
From the Hotel the Guests Were
Not Alarmed and Few
Knew of the Fire.
EueciaJ l>;Â«r>Â«.tch to The Call.
DEL, MONTE. April 14.â The celebrated
Del Monte clubhouse, which stands about
2jO yards from the Hotel del Monte,
caught lire about half-past 2 o'clock this
morning. The main portion, which includes
the clubrooms and bar and billiard-rooms,
xvere destroyed. The bowling alley and
Â¦w-ir.e cellars remained intact and all the
vines and liquors except those in the bar
tvtre saved.
The nre started at some point between
the rrtlfng and roof of the front cable of
the buiidine. supposably from a defective
rue. though the exact cause is not known,
and must have gained considerable head
uay before breaking through the roof, for
Â¦Rhen it was discovered by a night vratch
raan. who was making his rounds, the
greater portion of the roof was in a blaze.
tf\o one was in the building at the time
except two men who sleep in the rear,
and they knew nothing of the danger un
til aroused by the alarm of fire that was
turned In immediately by the night watch
man. It took nearly an hour to get the
liames under control, although the hotel
fire department did splendid work. The
lire was in an almost inaccessible portion
of the building and the bowling alley had
commenced to burn before the streams of
water thrown upon it began to have any
effect. The bowling alley, however,
was only slightly damaged, and all
back of It and below it escaped de
struction. A strange feature of the dis
aster is that rone of the rare shrubs and
plants that surround the clubhouse and
render it one of the most notable spots In
the De! Monte grounds were Injured in
the least.
The clubhouse, being at a distance from
the .hotel proper, very few of the guests
knew of the rire until this morning, and
there was no panic or disturbance of any
kind.
W. A. Jur.ker, manager of Hotel del
Monte, was seen this morning. He said
he thought $5(Â«X> would about cover the
loss occasioned by the fire, although until
a more complete examination is made the
total loss will not be known. There was
no insurance, the Pacific Improvement
Company carrying its own risks oa its
rroperty hereabouts.

THE PARIS EXPOSITION.
YESTERDAY was opened at Paris that great
exposition of arts and industries at which all the
nations of the earth will be peaceful rivals, and
in which the triumph of one will mean nothing more
than that it has accomplished most to promote the
welfare of all. Whatever is done to increase science,
advance art, improve machinery, lighten labor and
make more abundant and more easily obtainable the
comforts and the luxuries of life, redounds to the ad
vantage of humanity as a whole. Those who are
victors at Paris will be only those who are the best
servants in ministering to the needs of men.
The opening of the exposition will serve to distract
attention, to some extent at least, from the bloody
and aggressive wars now being carried on in other
lands, and notably in South Africa. What Russia
is doing in Asia, what we are doing in the Philip
pines, what France is striving for in Madagascar and
what Germany is building a great navy to perform,
are little matters in comparison to the immense crime
of stamping out the brave republics that are battling
for independence against Great Britain. Were it not
for that war, the world would be able to greet the
exposition in Paris with a true enthusiasm, and in an
almost undisturbed peace study and learn the profit
able lessons which its miles of splendor will teach the
mind while delighting the eye.
Parishas a right to call herself the exposition city
of the world. Other great cities,, such as London,
Vienna, Philadelphia and Chicago, have had univer
sal expositions, but each has had but one of any
note. Paris has had sixteen,. and, moreover, it was
to her citizens the world owes the idea of such ex
hibits. No illustration of the wonderful difference
which the closing century has made in the ways of
the world could be more striking than a contrast be
tween the first universal exposition which opened in
Paris in 1798 with no exhibits and lasted three days,
and that which was opened yesterday with every na
tion and race on earth represented, and with ex
hibits so numerous as to be well nigh innumerable.
It is gratifying to American pride that while the
exposition was not ready for display, being far from
complete, the American exhibit was farther advanced
than any other, and, in fact, would have been ready
had it not been that the incomplete condition of ths
exposition as a whole, and the amount of work going
on led the American authorities to delay in placing
SWARMS OF JAPANESE.
SOME time ago The Call directed attention to the
rapid increase of Japanese immigration at this
port, and pointed out the necessity for restrict
ing it. It is now to be noted that Japanese are swarm
ing all along our Pacific Coast line wherever ships
from Japan find a port.
Dispatches from Vancouver arc to the effect that
upward of 3000 Japanese have landed there during
the last four weeks, and that 4000 more are booked
to arrive during the month. Some of these immi
grants may remain in British Columbia, but it is safe
to say the majority will hasten to cross into the
United States as quickly as they can do so. There is
more abundant work on this side the line and wages
are higher. The money-seeking Japs will not remain
among the Canadians very long after they find a
means of making their way southward through Wash
ington and Oregon to California.
This invasion of Japanese, coming as it does at a
time when the records of the port show also a por
tentous increase in the number of Chinese admitted,
not only to the port, but to citizenship, is a proof
that the revival of prosperity, work and wages has
had the effect of stimulating the rush of orientals to
our labor market. The danger of an execssiye im
migration from the Orient is therefore once more is
menacing as it has ever been in our. history. The
campaign for the protection of the coast from that
danger will have to be taken up again and carried on
this time for the purpose of excluding Japanese as
well as Chinese. In fact, it should be made to exclude
all oriental races, for it is quite possible the exploita
tion of the Philippines "may lead to an immigration of
some of the millions from those islands unless it be.
prohibited. . â¢
The evil is one upon which the people will' have to
keep continuous guard. It will be a menace to Cali
fornia and the Pacific Coast generally so long as
tvages here' are higher than those in the Orient and
inducements exist for wage-earners to come here.
The more the numbers of the Japanese among us in
crease, the more difficult will it be to exclude others
hereafter. The issue is one that must be dealt with
at once.

The New York Chamber of Commerce has started

not.

A "TOMMYROT" CHARGE.
AMPLE opportunity was given on Friday for all
persons concerned in the admission of Chi
nese to this city to make such explanation as
they could in reply to the startling exposure made
by The Call of that morning. Yesterday these expla
nations were published by The Call in full, for it is
the invariable policy of this paper to give every man
a fair hearing whenever suspicion of wrongdoing falls
upon him. In all these replies and explanations
there was not a single contradiction of any fact stated
by The Call. It was conceded that the figures stating
the number of Chinese admitted were copied from
the record and are correct. So the statements stand
undisputed that more than 10.000 Chinese have been
admitted to this port during the collectorship of
Colonel Jackson, and that a large percentage of them
have been admitted not only to the port, but to citi
zenship as natives of the country.
Our contemporaries dealt with the exposure each
after its own fashion. The yellow organ of the fugi
tive proprietor undertook to take to itself the credit
of exposing the wrong, thus following the policy it
long since adopted of taking stories from The Call
and claiming them as its own. The most character
istic comment of the whole, however, was that of the
evening organ of the Canadian faker, which under his
management has been devoted mainly to the style of
stuff known as "tornmyrot." That sillybilly sheet
raised the cry that the exposure would injure the city
by so irritating the Chinese they would abandon their
project of holding here a great festival and pageant.
That charge is so silly it cannot be stated gravely
in any other language than that of the author. It
run? thus:
This morning's Call lias a tremendous sensation. That
If. It cnvor3 over two pages of the paper, which is con
sidered pretty large. Its effort Is clearly to Injure the
reputations of Bcvrral well known men. Its effect may
bf> to f=o Jnefxsc the Chinese Consul General and the
Chinese merchants of the city that they may abandon
their pro.if-ct to have a splendid pageant here. Consul
General Ho Yew has been endeavoring to get certain
privileges that would enable his countrymen to parade
the streets and make a .fine show. The transportation
xr.en, who arc- best posted on travel to and from the city,
have raid that such a display would attract to the city
at least 53,000 strangers. Some estimates were much
higher. All agreed that It would be a good thing for
San Francisco. But the Consul General and his people
have had pmall encouragement, and in addition have
been much annoyed by the Board of Health. Now comes
The Call with a tirade against the Chinese which may
altogether discourage the Consul General.
It is not at all likely the exposure of the extent of
the Mongolian invasion will interfere with the pur
posed festival, but should it do so the city could bet
ter aflord to lose the street pageant than to leave
open the door for the admission of thousands of
Chinese claiming the right of citizenship. We can
not sacrifice American labor and the general welfare
of the Pacific Coast for the sake of njaking a Chinese
holiday. Even the Canadians would not pursue such
a policy, ar.d the proprietor of the Evening Tommy
rot would not preach in his own country the doctrine
he preaches here.
The Call did not publish the record of Chinese
immigration without duly considering what the effect
would be. The only serious menace to the continued
prosperity of California is that of a possible influx
of Chinese with a large increase of Chinese voters.
To guard against that danger is the duty of every
Californian. When the first cry was raised against
Chinese immigration, years ago, it was met by the
charge that the cry would injure the city. The people
were not alarmed then, nor will they be disturbed
now by a repetition of the old defense of coolie labor
and coolie citizenship. The exclusion act represents
not only the law of the land, but the sentiment of the
people. Its enforcement is necessary to the welfare of
the white race znd its violation or evasion is an of
fense which can never be too often nor too forcibly
denounced.

THE CALL'S EXPOSE.
Vallejo Chronicle, April 13.
The San Francisco Call in Its issue of
this morning exposes what It claims is a
conspiracy by which a coterie of attor
neys, through the neutrality of the Col
lector of trte Port, is gaining riches and at
the same time Hooding San Francisco with
a Mongolian immigration, a large per cent
of whom are allowed to' land as native
sonsâ Chinamen who allege that they were
born in this country and departed from
it prior to. ISS2, when the exclusion law
went into effect. So numerous are these
native sons of Chinamen who have recent
ly been admitted one would think the
passage of the exclusion law in ISS2 acted
with emetic-like effect, and at. that time
caused the infants and children ' of San
Francisco's Chinese population to stam
pede to the native heath of their parents.
While we cannot and do not believe that
Colonel John P. Jackson is a party to the
alleged frauds, The Call's expose is of
such a character that' the matter demands
a very thorough investigation. Â¦ It does
not need a very strong imagination to see
that there is something radically crooked
somewhere, and that some lawyers are
getting rich at the expense of California.
It is only recently that a Chinaman in this
city appeared at the Chinese bureau In
San Francisco to certify to the age of a
student Chinese who was denied a landing
because he seemed to be over-old. Simply
a statement was required of the China
man, which, could have been made ver
bally or put on paper In two minutes, but
this was not done. He was turned over
to a. lawyer by an Inspector, who handed
him a sheet of foolscap on which was a
typewritten statement to sign. He signed
it, and that piece of foolscap paper cost
the Chinaman J25.
This in a measure indicates that the Chi
nese exclusion law is a magnificent thing
to enable lawyers to get rich, and accord
ing to the figures published by The Call,
a poor thing to keep out of our State
hordes of Chinamen now coming In. If
there Is no fraud, then the exclusion law
needs revision, for if its popularity with
the Chinese continues there is no telling
to what limits the coming of native sons
and students will reach. If there Is fraud,
and the exclusion law Is being-used to en
rich a coterie of lawyers, then the ex
posure is timely, and The Call will con
tinue doing a good service in driving the
guilty ones to their proper quarters.
GAMBLING AND EMBEZZLEMENTS.
JAMES R. GARNISS, resident manager of the
American Surety Company of New* York, in
commenting upon the losses of that company
through the defalcations or embezzlements of those
for whom it had given bond, stated to a representa
tive of The Call that during the past year 57 per cent
of his company's profits has been squandered at
gaming-tables and racetracks and similar places. He
estimated the loss of the American Surety Company
during the past year through such means at the
enormous sum of Â£500,000.
For the full understanding of that statement it is
to be borne in mind that the American is not the only
surety company doing business in the United States
or in this city. There are others, whose losses are
doubtless as large in proportion to their business as
that of the company Mr. Garniss represents. The loss
of $100,000 by the defalcation of Treasurer Widber, for
example, was not that of the American Surety Com
pany. It is thus evident that the $500,000 lost by the
American was but a fraction of the total loss to sure
ties last year through embezzlements due to gambling.
A significant feature of the revelation made by Mr.
Garniss is that while his company has lost that vast
sum of money in a single year, the name of the com
pany hardly appears in the records of the courts as
a loser. In fact, the company has no recourse, no re
dress. When a . man for whom it has given bond
turns embezzler and flies or commits suicide, there
is nothing for the company to do but to pay the loss.
To attempt to prosecute or to recover would simply
vetoe to throw money in hand after money in the bush.
By reason of that fact the public is never made aware
of the extent to which embezzling is carried on and
surety companies suffer. The aggregate of losses
runs far up into the millions of dollars every year.
That is a part of the price the American people pay
for the folly of permitting gambling to be carried on
under conditions that render it a continuous tempta
tion to the public.
Facts of this kind are matters of grave importance.
The list of embezzlers and defaulters in this city
lengthens too rapidly. Hardly have the people re
covered from the shock of the exposure of the crime
of one hitherto respected citizen before another
comes. As. Mr. Garniss said of those who play the
races and other gambling games,; ''They, fall like the
leaves of autumn." The records ;of, . our { criminal
courts and of the Morgue tell much, but not all, of
the fearful story.
It is for the municipal authorities to determine
whether this evil is to be longer permitted in San
Francisco. The law gives into their hands authority
to crush the evil, and public opinion will support
them if they be resolute in doing so. Once more a
warning lesson has been given, and should the warn
ing be not heeded it will not be long before another
comes.

meeting in New York, but as he did' not vote it is

BY REV. F. M. BRISTOL
D. D., President McKay's Pastor.
I PROTEST against the application of the term "society to
1 that little set of little fools who contribute nothing but
I scandal to the annals of a community. The true society of
1 America,- composed of the brains and virtue of her typical
men and women, to be found in Washington, New lork,
Baltimore, Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago and in every city
and town and village of this country, is worthy of all honor
and respect. Husbands never had more virtuous wives nor
wives truer husbanos; sons never had sweeter, purer motners
nor mothers nobler, cleaner sons; brothers never had more
chaste, intelligent sisters, nor sisters more heroic, chivalrous,
high-minded brothers than they have to-day and in our own
America,-
Democracy, is conducive to virtue. The most corrupt, licen
tious social conditions are found where class distinctions pre
vail, equality is denied and woman 13 robbed of her right, her
freedom and her independence. The morally healthy condition
of American society is due to the freedom, Intelligence and ex
alted character of American womanhood. And that woman
hood, I claim, Is the highest, purest type that has yet appeared
in the evolution of society. In contrast with this American so
ciety let the pessimist study Athenian society in the days of
Aspasia, Roman society in the time of Cleopatra, French soci
ety in the age of Recamier and Malntenon, English society in
the reign of Elizabeth or Charles II or the Georges. What en
couraging ; progress has been made in the moral sentiments and
standards : of society since the American Revolution gave aris
tocracy and sovereignty tc- the common people! The virtue and
honor of this world are ir; the common people.

DEGENERACY OF AMERICAN SOCIETY.
LEASING THE RANGES.
' I 'HE CALL has heretofore "furnished the econo
1 mic and physical facts .which are* the basis '.of
the policy for leasing the grazing ranges in the
arid region west of the ninety-ninth meridian. These
ranges are now used in common by the cattle, sheep
and horse growers, and as a result have been so over
stocked that the forage on them is disappearing, the
grazing business is in the course of rapid extinction,
and the aridity of the whole region is so increased as
to foreclose upon any hope of domesticating agricul
ture there which will support a fair population.
That there is opposition to leasing is a matter of
course. It is usually put on grounds that are unreal.
The opponents, almost invariably, appeal in behalf of
the homesteader and the poor agricultural settler,
when they are the worst enemies of both classes.
The National Livestock Association has under
taken to aid the leasing policy, and to that end has
appointed a committee to draw a bill for an act to
safeguard all interests, and put over the ranges a
leasehold care and control, which will not only
arrest their rapid destruction, but in time re
new their lost grasses and other nutritious for
age. This committee, after listening to all ob
jections, and having given due weight to
the appeals to prejudice, passion and fear
used by the advocates of the open range, have
adopted a course which appears to be clear of any pos
sible objection. This course is laid down by the fol
lowing action of the committee, adopted at Denver
last Tuesday: "Whereas, it is apparent that Congress
will await the crystallization of public sentiment upon
some policy protective of the grazing lands on the
public domain west of the ninety-ninth meridian;
and whereas, it is the determined purpose of those
who favor the leasing of the grazing lands that any
legislation for that purpose must reserve and protect
all the riglitsof the agricultural owner, of the home
steader and future agricultural settler, the mineral
prospector, and of all stock-owners, large and small,
now in actual use of the ranges; and whereas, the
ample time to prepare a bill for such a law, furnished
by the waiting attitude of Congress, affords the op
portunity for this committee to be informed in every
element of the problem; therefore, Resolved, That
this committee proceed to gather all information
upon the subject, and put the same into a bill, which
will faithfully embody the principles set forth in the
preamble hereto, and the provisions of which shall
be inoperative, except in counties in the region to
which it applies, in which the farmers and stock
owners ask for the same; and such bill shall be ready
for presentation to Congress at the next session for
action by that body."
The chairman of the committee was then authorized
to appoint sub-committees to prepare the several sec
tions of the bill, the whole to be fitted and put to
gether at a meeting to be held at Salt Lake City
during the summer. These committees are four In
number; one will consider the question of driveways
between summer and winter range; another will pre
pare the section to accommodate the leasehold boun
daries to the use of available water on the public
domain; another will frame that feature of the bill
which will reserve and protect the rights of agricul
tural settlers, homesteaders, mineral" prospectors and
actual owners of stock now using the ranges, and a
fourth will frame that provision of the bill which
limits its effect to such counties west of the ninety
ninth meridian as accept its provisions, such accept
ance to be dependent upon the petition of the ranch
ers, land-owners and stock-owners. This section will
provide the method by which this shall be done.
It will be seen that this option absolutely ends all
opposition based upon fear that the meat combine, or
any other, will lease the ranges, to the exclusion of
their present occupants and abutting land-owners.
The method is copied largely from the mining laws
of the country, which, in effect, make a camp of
miners the legislators in their own affairs. The pro
vision is excellent and answers every objection that
can be made.
It is our opinion that under this plan a law will be
passed, and that thereby an important step forward
will have been taken in the interest of the livestock
industry, as well as of the great irrigation movements
of the West.

good old-fashioned way by Lyman D.
Foster Jr. It was Master Foster's fourth
birthday and he celebrated it by naming
one of the finest schooners ever built on
the coast.
The new vessel is the third of her class
turned out by Hay & Wright for the same
owners, while the keel of a fourth will
be laid In the cradle Just vacated by the
Luzon on Monday. The first of the fleet
was the Philippine, and she is now on
her way back from Manila. The next was
the Expansion, and she is on her way to
San Pedro. The third is the Luzon, and
she is under charter to take a load of
lumber to Manila for the Government.
The Luzon is ISB feet over all, 36 feet 8
inches beam and 12 feet 6 inches deep.
She will carry 750,000 feet of lumber. No
expense has been spared on the vessel.
Water Front Notes.
The revenue cutter Manning arrived
from San Diego yesterday and will be
fitted out for a cruise In Bering Sea. She
was built In the East and has come here
via the Straits of Magellan and South and
Central American ports. She is a hand
some little craft and will be a valuable
addition to the revenue fleet.
The whaling bark John and Wlnthrop
had to put back into port yesterday. She
started from here for Cape Nome, but her
deckload was too heavy and the vessel
became cranky. The captain would not
risk going on, so he started back, arriv
ing yesterday morning. The deckload will
be removed and the vessel will sail again
to-morrow.
The schooner Kodlak. the first of the
Alaska Commercial Company's fleet, got
away for Cape Nome yesterday.
The schooner Carrie and Annie also
started for the gold fields. She took away
about fifteen passengers.

CRIME FOSTERED
BY RACE TRACKS
Surety Company Pays for Half a
Million Lost to Gamblers
Within^ a Year.
â ~. > .
Adolph Spher's Fall Only a Sample of the
'Appalling Damage Being Daily Wrought
by the Tremendous Evil.
FIFTY-SEVEN per cent of the net
earnings, of the American Surety
Company of New Yorkâ half a mil
lion dollars embezzled and squan
dered at the racetracks, in poolrooms and
over the green cloth of the gaming table;
an even half-dozen cases of embezzlement
involving, the" theft of $20,000 adjusted by
the firm of Reddy, Campbell & Metson. is
a portion of the appalling record of crime
and Its accompanying misery in San Fran
cisco for the period of one year, and <ill
directly traceable to the existence of race
tracks in proximity to the city.
These fact^s are but few among the
many equally as startling that have come
to light since the flight of Adolph Soher
a few days ago after having embezzled
the trust funds that came into his posses
sion as administrator of theestate of his
father, the late Dr. Lewis Soher.
The amazing array of facts causes the
people to wonder if one surety company
has lost half a million dollars in one year
through the peculations of those whose
honesty is guaranteed; if one linn of law
yers has adjusted six embezzlement cases
involving $20,000, and all lost at the track
or at other fleecing grounds, what must
be the aggregate sum of the total loss of
all the surety companies doing business
In this city and what must be the great
total of all embezzlement cases unheard
of in the courts, adjusted by the two
thousand and odd lawyers of San Francis
co? This is the question the people are
asking, but as they wait and muse plung
ing horses gaffed by tricky riders come
whirling under the wire and each time
thousands of dollars, some honestly
earned, more stolen and embezzled, flow
into the coffers of men who prey upon the
weaknesses of people for livelihood and
fortune. A story, startling as it is omin
ous for the future of the city's young
men, has grown out of the flight of Adolph
Soher. Not only has It brought to light
the tremendous losses of corporations and
surety companies, but it has developed
the fact that every day that racing is car
ried on within easy leach of San Fran
cisco detectives trained and shrewd in
their calling file a report for the informa
tion of bankers, business men and law
yers. On that report appears the name of
every man known to occupy a position of
trust In this city who lays aside his hon
est occupation if but for an hour and
tempts fortune at the racetracks.
So dangerous do the business men of the
city consider the racetracks that they are
compelled to expend their funds for in
formation regarding Its frequenters. No
association of business men thus guards
against house breakers or thieves that ply
their trade at dead of night. They are
not compelled to do so. The breaking of
a safe or the wielding of a slungshot may
deprive them of the profits of a year, but
in tuch an episode they see less danger
than that which may at any time con
front them If tin? harpies of the track are
allowed to work unwatched and unmo
lested.
Adolph Soher is still at laige, and all
day yesterday Mrs. Soher lay in her
apartments in a downtown hostelry pros
trated with grief. Many friends remained
with her and comforted her as best they
could, but could do little to assuage her
grief. Ben Thorn, the sterling Sheriff of
calaveras County, Mrs. Sorer's father,
arrived in tne city yesterday and
will care for Mrs. boher and her little
daughter Lurline.
fc.ariy yesteroay morning the officials of
the American Surety company began
tneir investigation into the uitatrs of the
Soher estate. While some traced tub
manner in which the fugitive squandered
tne funds placed in his possession others
made a ruuie erfort to locate nis where
abouts
Keddy, Campbell & Metson will doubt
less make the initial move to recover from
the surety company the funds embezzled
from the Soher estate. Tnis firm repre
sents all of the heirs with the exception
of the fugitive and Emile, and there wul
be but little delay in presenting the
claim. Next Wednesday the hearing on
the matter of the settlement of Adolplv
Soher's final account as administrator
will be called by Judge Troutt. At that
time Attorney Campbell will move that
the authority of the fugitive as trustee
be suspended and that another adminis
trator be appointed. This will open the
way for an action to recover the funds
emDezzled, from the surety company.
"Ever since the first of the year, when
Soher obtained a three months" leave
from the postal authorities, I suspectedâ
in fact, I Knewâ that he was squandering
ill-gotten money at the track, said Mr.
Campbell yesterday. "I notified other
counsel In the case, but in the face of
Soher's strenuous denials they did not see
(it to carry the investigation of his ac
counts with the estate into the
courts. I have long been awaro
that he was gambling. Lawyers, bank
ers and business men throughout the
city now know who frequent the tracks
and how they play when they are there.
I am not at liberty to tell through what
medium we gain this information, but of
late we find that we must have informa
tion, as the danger that lurks in the ex
istence of the tracks for those dependent
upon others holding positions of trust la
becoming greater with each passing race.
"During the last year this rirm has ad
justed six cases of embezzlement, and in
no instance wns the embezzler over 24
years of age. The amount involved was
$20,000, and all of these young men were
either employed in banks or commercial
houses. In one instance the aged father
and mother were forced to mortgage their
home to save their son from a term In
prison. His employer felt the young
man's disgrace as keenly as did the
parents, and after securing the mortgage
took the young man back into his employ
and arranged with him to pay off the
mortgage his crime had forced on the
home of his parents. The -other cases
were equally as sad and it was only
through the leniency of employers and the
ability of parents and friends to make
good the amounts of the defalcations that
the cases were kept from the public and
the yountr men from prison. Other firms
in the city are frequently called upon to
act In the capacity of adfusters of similar
cases, and they ever will be until the
racetracks have been declared a menace
to the public safety and closed by the
lawmakintr bodies of the municipalities
and the State."
As yet tne postal authorities have taken
no action against Soher. His leave of ab
sence has expired, but he will probably
remain away.

HEART DISEASE.
Some Facts Regarding the Rapid In-
crense of Heart Trouble.
Heart trouble, at least among the
Americans, is certainly increasing and
while this may be largely due to the ex-
citement and.worry'of American business
life, it is more often the result of weak
stomachs, of poor digestion:
Real . organic disease is incurable; but
not one case in a hundred of heart trou-
ble is organic.
The close relation between heart trouble
and poor digestion is because both or-
gans are controlled by the same great
nerves, the Sympathetic and the Pneu-
mogastrlc.
.In another way also the heart is af-
fected by the form of poor digestion,
which causes gas and fermentation from
half digested food. There is a feeling of
oppression and heaviness in the chest
caused by pressure of the distended stom-
ach on the heart ' and lungs, interfering
with their action: ; hence arises palpita-
tion and short breath.
Poor digestion also poisons the blood,
making it thin and watery, which irri-
tates and weakens the heart.
The most sensible treatment for heart
trouble Is to improve the digestion and
to insure the prompt assimilation of food.
This can be done by the regular use af-
tir meals of some safe, pleasant and ef-
fective digestive preparation, like Stu-
art's Dyspepsia Tablets, which may be
found at drug stores, and which contain
valuable, harmless digestive elements in
a pleasant, convenient form.
It is safe to nay that the regular, per-
sistent use of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
at meal times will cure any form of stom-
ach - trouble except cancer of the stom-
ach. . sfeasÃi

THOUGHT THE ALCAZAR
THEATER WAS ON FIRE
â¢
During an act of "Quo Vadls" at the
Alcazar Theater yesterday afternoon a
woman whose seat was near the stage
noticed the odor of smoke which came
from a torch used In a drill scene. The
smoke alarmed the woman, and without
looking to find Its cause raised the cry
of "Fire!"
Most of the audience know that the
smoke simply aroso from th<Â» torch, and
little commotion occurred. A few girls
in the rear of the house rushed out into
the foyer, but order was quickly restored
by the theatrical staff.

NEW DRYDOCK
TO BE BUILT AT
HUNTERS POINT
Board of Directors After an
Examination Have Se
lected a Site.
The Projected Structure Will Be Lo
cated South of and Close
to the Present . - ~:^ -
Plant.
The great Increase In the dimensions of
modern seagoing vessels, both warships
and freight carriers, has convinced the
directors of the California Drydock Com
pany that they must Improve and Increase
their facilities for the docking of this
class In order to keep up with the times.
The present dock at Hunters Point can
not accommodate a larger ship than the
Oregon. When the Hancock was aocked
there It required considerable ingenuity
to get her Inside the gate. The Oregon,
which had been inside three times, was a
much easier fit, but her width filled up
the dock close to its sides. At the time*
the present dock was constructed, tn ISSS,
it was deemed capable of holding any
vessel afloat, but since those days ship
building has progressed, and with Its
progress dockage must also progress to
accommodate the vessels.
In view of the experience with the Han
cock and Oregxm the board of directors at
a recent meeting decided to take steps to
either enlarge the present dock or con
struct a new one. It was ascertained
after an Investigation that to extend the
present dock and to widen the entrance
would cost nearly as much as to construct
a new dock, and In addition to. this the
docking of vessels would have to be dis
continued during the period of reconstruc
tion. Last Friday William Babcock, Cap
tain George S. Wright. J. C. Coleman. J.
H. Meyer and Secretary W*. F. Russell ot
the board of directors went over the
ground at Hunter* Point and decided to
construct a new dock on the south and
not far from where the present dock Is
located. ...
Work will be commenced Inside of
thirty days, and the company expect!* to
have the dock ready to receive Its first
vessel within eighteen months. By way
of a comparison the dimensions : of the
present dock and that of the proposed
dock are given: Present dockâ 433 feet
long:, 90 feet wide and 23 feet in depth
over sill. - New dockâ 7so feet in length,
122 feet wide and 28 feet deep at high tide.

Remarkable Words on Personal
Magnetism From an Emi-

IJb subject has excited so much inter-
â¢st or awakened so much discussion
3mong thinking people of late as that of
Personal Magnetism. It is worthy of
note that clergymen, doctors, college
presidents and men of science every-
where are giving it deep thought. Many
of them have openly certified to its won-
derful powers. The outspoken words of
Rev. Paul Weller of Gorham. N. V.. in
this connection will call forth no little
additional comment.

may be expected. The other events have
filled well and there is a fine lot of two
year-olds waiting to make their debut.

Fair Green on the Presidio Course
Covered With Strong, Springy
Turf and in Ideal Condi
tion for Golfing.
The second half of the second home
and-home tournament over thirty-six
holes, match play, took place yesterday
afternoon on the Presidio links between
teams representing the San Francisco and
Oakland golf clubs. The result was a
victory for the city players, 24 up, or,
adding the 7 holes*to their credit on the
Oakland links on the 7th insL, 31 up.
The San Francisco team won the first
match, 32 up, so their total score for the
two matches Is G3 up. The trophy offered
for the event thus becomes one of the
permanent adornments of the living
room of the San Francisco Golf Club
house. A bright sun lighted up the Pre
sidio course, the fair green of which was
In perfect condition. Much of the credit
for this Is due to the efforts of Messrs.
J. W. Byrne> and L. O. Kellogg, who have
devoted both time and pains to supervis
ing the work of putting the course into
good order. Throughout Â«..ie fair green
the turf Is close and strong, so that the
lies are excellent. The whole course at
the Presidio has been much Improved,
and the putting-greens are In excellent
condition. Only one Oaklander scored
against his San Francisco opponent â P.
S. Stratton, who was 1 up against H. D.
Pillsbury. For San Francisco Captain H.
B. Goodwin was 9 up, R. H. Gaylord 7
up and J. Laweon 4 up. R. M. Fitzger
ald of Oakland and E. J. McCutchen of
San Francisco tied. The medal play
scores of ~oth rounds and the number
of holes won are shown in the table:

he (Rev. Weller) had become a firm be-

"The facts are: The subject of Personal Mac-
netJam or Hypnotism, to which I have devoted

reading a scientific work on the subject, now

made after thorough investigation and with
complete knowledge of itf great value. I
make this sraipnient deliberately. The study
of Personal Mosnetism. as set forth in the ad-
mirable bor.k I have mentioned above, should
be next to thÂ» study of the Holy Bible.
"Personal Magnetism embodies all the laws

SHOOT COURSES
AND SLOW HARES
AT INGLESIDE
Favorites Ran Well, But
Few Short Ends Getting
the Flag.
The Card for To-Day Is Made Up of
Even /Matches and Should
Furnish Interesting
Coursing.
Remus, Hoot Mon, Tipple Tyler and
Marian, new dogs, had their "first time
out" yesterday at Ingleslde Coursing
Park in the run-down of the open stake,
and the latter three were beateifout,
while Remus won his course from Juliet.
Still, like the others, he Is outclassed in
the company of stake winners.
The first three courses on the card were
captured by the ehort-enders. High Born
Lady sold at 1 to 2Â»4, and after an unde
cided at even money beat Commodore
J\ash on a good hare, one of the few
turned loose, with a score of 6-3.
To-day's programme is made up of fair
ly even courses. Rona ran well yester-.
day, and her chances to-day are good.
Little Fullerton and Palmflower showed
in good form and their course should be
an interesting one in the first tie. After
two undecided runs Flyaway beat Mod
esty out, but against Elevenspot her
chances are not bright. Snapshot and
Rocker were both good. Rocker will run
with Mose to-day, and is against a hard
one in the imported dog. From the posi
tion on the card the winner of that
course stands a. good show to get into
the final. An eight-dog champion stake
is also on the day's programme: Follow

PERMANENT CUBES FOR MEN
We have made our reputation by curing the most aggra-
vated and chronic case 3 of lost manhood, varicocele, private
diseases, blood poison, rupture, kidney and bladder troubles,
etc.
If we could not cure, these ailments quickly and perma-
nently we could not afford to wait for pay until our patients are
well.
Any one doubting our ability and wishing to test
our methods, remedies and appliances, may deposit the
price of a cure in any bank in San Francisco. If a
cure is not effected in a reasonable -time the bank will re-
turn the money.
Payments may be made in monthly installments if pre-
ferred.
We have been established 19 years. All members of our
staff are specialists â physicians who have spent many years in
curing diseases and weakness of men.
Our institution is the largest and best equipped and our
practice the most extensive in America.
We never use anything of a dangerous nature, such as
electric belts, mercury or other injurious medicines.
We do not charge our patients for medicines or ap-
pliances. Other doctors charge an additional fee for
medicines, etc., or send their patients to high-priced
drugstores. All our remedies are prepared in our own
private laboratory.
Our home cure system is marvelously successful. If you
cannot visit San Francisco write us in confidence and we will
send you, sealed, by mail, a booklet which contains a treatise on
all diseases and weakness of men, and a great deal of other val-
uable information of a private nature for men, old or young,

SCHOOL FUNDS SHORT.
Unpleasant Predicament cf Woodland
Board of Education.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WOODLAND. April 14.â The City Board
of Education Is confronted with a seriotia
problem. The hleh school funds will bÂ«
exhausted about May 11 and thera will ba
no more money available until next De
cember. This is due to a misunderstand
ing of the City Trustees a3 to the amount
necessary to be rajsed by taxation.
The tax levy was fixed too low, and
when the error was discovered the Supe
rior Court decided that as the tax levy
can only be fixed on a certain day. tha
error couM not be corrected. The Trus
tees are willing to provide In the next tax
levy far any deficiency, but the -Board of
Education is not satisfied it will not ba
personally responsible for all warrants
signed by it when there will be no money
to meet such warrants until another tax
levy is made and collected. An earnest
effort will be made to devise some means
of obviating the close of the High School
from May until December.

TRAINED ANIMAL SHOW
DRAWS A BIG HOUSE
Gentry's trained animal show had a
"crowded house" last night at the initial
performance of Its two weeks' stay at
Central Park. The entertainment Is with
out doubt a splendid exhibition of what
patience and unceasing attention can ac
complish in the way of educating the
lower animals to the highest degree ! of
subservance. The performance is out of
the ordinary run of animal shows, and is
richly staged throughout.
The management has produced a style
of entertainment that Is not only for the
little ones but one that is worth the at
-tentlon of all who desire to witness an In
telligent exhibition of animal education.
CONCERT AND OPERA
Crowding Fischer's Concert House.
Sketched by a master hand, replete with
situations strong In their dramatic Inten
sity and thrilling with music that beats
and throbs with the passionate yearning
of breaking hearts, "Cavallerla Rustl
cana" leaped into almost Immediate favor
with the music-loving American public.
As presented at Fischer's Concert House
by the quintet of artists from sunny Italy
it has scored an even greater success than
"II Trovatore," and will be retained for
another week.
The Santuzza of Slgnorlna Barduccl
and Turlddu of Slgnor Badarocco are,
both from acting and singing standpoints,
almost perfect. The splendid art and
wonderful voice af Barduccl were never
shown to better advantage than as the
wronger and Insulted Santuzza. Vargas,
as Alflo, and the Lola of Puererl and
Mamma Lucia of Pollettlnl were perfect
In detail and true ta the traditions of the
art that Is eecond nature to this talented
quintet.
Leader Hlnrichs' clever work with the
baton made the Incidental music as en
joyable as the work of the quintet, and
the Intermezzo has received nightly en
cores.
The vocal selections of Slgnorlna Pol
lettlnl, Baby Ruth, Mile. Puereri and the
duet In costume between Vargas and the
beautiful Salvlnl all received their meed
of applause.
The programme, with the exception of
"Cavallerla," will be changed for the com
ing week.

REPUBLICANS
OF SANTA CLARA
MAY REVOLT
Good Government League
Takes Significant
Action.
Demands That the County Committee
Calls Primaries Instead of Ar
bitrarily Appointing
Delegates.
Sr*clal Disratch to The Call
SAX JOSE. April 14.â Unless the Repub
lican State Central Committee orders the
primary elections In the Fifth Congres
sional District to select delegates to the
State and Congressional conventions at
Sacramento on May 15 there will be a re
volt among Santa Clara County Repub
licans that may prove serious tto the elec
tion of a Republican Congressman and cut
some figure In the Presidential election in
California.
Tbls grows out of the action" of the
State Central Committee in refusing to
call primaries in this county. The league
declares this places the selection of dele
gates in the hands of the Rea gang and
Ignores the Republican Good Government
League, which was responsible for the
Republican majority in this county for
the last State ticket. A week ago reso
lutions were passed asking the State Com
mittee to call primaries for the selection
of delegates. Since then the remarks of
Committeeman Watts as published in
The Call, in which he stated no demand
for primaries wan made, aroused the
league, and at to-day's meeting the mat
ter was fuily discussed. '
The following resolution was unani
mously adopted:
"Whereas. The Republican Congres
sional Committee of the Fifth District, as
stated by Alva Watts of said committee,
â¢has r.ot heard of any Republican that
wanted a primary election' In said dis
trict, therefore, be It
"Resolved, By the Republican Good
Government League of Santa Clara Coun
ty, representing a membership of more
than 2000 members of the Republican
party, that we demand that all delegates
to represent the party In the Fifth Dis
trict be selected by primaries as near as
may be in accord with the primary elec
tion laws of this State, and we protest
against the appointment of any delegates
from this county to any district conven
tion by any Congressional or county com
mittee."
A committee, consisting of Messrs. C.
W. Chllds. Allen Brant. J. P. Jarman, F.
11. Babb and I. A. Latta, was appointed
to make arrangements for holding prima
ries in case the State Committee refuses
to call them.

AWAITING THE
ULTIMATUM OF
THE COMMANDER
On His Decision Hangs the
Fate of the Division
Encampment. -
Â»
Several National Guard Resignations
Accepted and a Number of Com
missions Issued â Elections
to Be Held.
The commander in chief of the National
Guard of California, who is at present
in the southern part of the State, has not
aa yet given any intimation as to what he
proposes 10 do about the acceptance or
rejection of the site at Santa Cruz se
lected as a camp for the guard, although
he promised to do so several weeks ago.
In consequence there Is no certainty that
there will be a division camp In August.
There does not appear to be any great
amount of enthusiasm on the subject of a
camp. Those who are in the Eighth Regi
ment do not favor one, those In the Fifth
are not overparticular and the Sixth and
Seventh do not feel as If they care to
tamp out for a week. Then again it Is
said that the guard at this time is not in
a condition to go into a division encamp
ment, as it is not properly equipped for
such, being without tents, ovens, blankets
and other articles that are necessary.
The election of field officers of the First
Regiment of Infantry is about as far off
as It was a month ago. Captain Connolly

COMMITTEE SELECTS THIS IDEA A3 SUPERIOR TO THE -STARS
AND STRIFES'"
{â¢ |f -HE committee arpolr.ted by Mayor Phelan to select a design for a jnunici
ps.l flatr met !n the chief executive's office yesterday afternoon and after
]Â£ inspecting seme facruy-flv* designs submitted by various artists flnally
"" accepted the one drawn by Johr. M. Gamble of 323 Monteomery street. The
members of the comm!tteÂ« present were- Park Commissioner Stantcm. Ccmmls
slor.^r cf Public Works Mendell. Supen-isors Duboce and Hotaling. The com
mittee was cf Urn opfzdon that the flag drawn by Mr. Gamble fulHlled the re
quirements of simplicity and was eirhltmatic of the municipality to a greater
extcnr than the ethers. Honorable mention was also given to Herman SchefTarna
a=d Sydney Armer. the former representing a ship surrounded by a wreath
typifyirx Yerba Ruena and the latter a rising: eun on a plain white background.
The dcs;en tuggested by The Call, that cf the glorious "stars and stripes,"
which have been good enough for this great nation for more than a century, was
not considered by the committee
In *xpla!r.::ig his design the successful contestant, who will receive a prize of
$jO. says:
"The phenix Is the crest of the city of San Francisco and may emblemize the
city tn time past rising into the greater strrnyth and beauty from its own
ushes; also. It may bÂ« taken as an emblem of a new era of prosperity under its
present charter. It seercs to me to be the most fittinjr device to go with the
motto of the city. It t* in two colors, shadedâ biack typifying Iron, and the yel
low g'cld. This drawing would be suitable for a f.air of ceremony, made of silk,
with illuminated design. The eclors of the designs are interchangeable, and any
ether combination of colors may be used with these designs. Black and gold
seem especially suitable as typifying the metals spoken of in the motto."

WARSHIPS ORDERED
OUT OF COMMISSION
jTavy Department Handicapped by
the Lack of Officers for the
Vessels.
"WASHINGTON, April 14.â The Navy
Departmer.t was under the necessity to
day of ordering the United States cruiser
Detroit to the Portsmouth Navy Yard,
New Hampshire, to go out of commission.
2n addition to this orders have been pre
pared to put the Marblehead out of com
mission at Mare Island, and telegraph
orders have beÂ«n sent to Admiral WatFon
to send the gunboats Bennington and Con
cord, now at Manila, to San Francisco,
where they also will be put out of com
mission. The big battleships Indiana and
Massachusetts, which have just been over
hauled at the New York Navy Yard, are
to be cent to League Island about the first
of the month to be laid up in ordinary,
instead of being commissioned.
This remarkable reduction of the num
ber of ships in commission is ascribed at
the Navy Department to the lack of a
sufficient number of officers to furnish
complements for the ships absolutely re
quired for naval purposes. The battleship
Kearsarpe has just be*n put into commis
cion. and the Illinois on the Atlantic side
and the Wisconsin on the Pacific Coast
must he commissioned immediately in
order that the ships may be taken over
from the hands of the contractors. Then
there are some smaller craft, like th*>
fitringham and the Chesapeake, calling
Jor commissions and crews.
The extent of the shortage may be sug
gested by the fact that fof all of the four
*rreat gur.s in the double turrets of the
sew battleship Kearsarge but one officer
could be spared, involving undue risk,
*yen In times of peace. The Navigation
liureau is authority for the statement
that there are fully ICO vacancies in the
line of the navy, and the total number of
officers is really less than It was fifteen
years ago, notwithstanding the great In
crease in the number of ships. The pro
jected shortening of the course at Annap
olis, provided for In the Impending naval
bill, would not substantially relieve the
situation in less than fifteen years, so the
officials are striving to find some method
lor temporary relief. Buch perhaps as the
graduation of the Annapolis classes for
the next two years one year In advance
of the usual time, or an authorization for
the Immediate appointment to Annapolis

GUARDIAN FOR WALTERMIRE.
Mind of the Hotel-Keeper Is Slightly
Unbalanced.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDWOOD CITY, April 14.-JudgeÃuck
this morning appointed H. W. Schaberg
as guardian of the person and estate of
A. F. Waltermire and fixed his bond in
the sum of $10,000.
About four months ago Mr. Waltermire
was attacked by. a malady which has de
veloped Into dropsy. By reason of hl3
sickness his mind has become disarranged
to such an extent as to incapacitate him
from attending safely to his own affairs.
He Is the owner of the well-known hotel
at Belmont that bears his name and has
been running the same for a great many
years. During this period he has accu
mulated considerable money and it was
to prevent him from squandering his
means that the' proceedings were insti
tuted. - . '.'.';
It is said that during the past six weeks
or two months he has spent about 54000.
He purchases things for which he has
no need and pays exorbitant prices for
them, such as second-hand shoes and
clothing, guns, pistols and carriages.
Mr. Waltermlre made no objection to
the appointment of a guardian and It was
upon his suggestion that Mr. Schaberg,
who is a Deputy County Clerk, was ap
pointed.

Â¦WASHINGTON. April J*.â rt is said at
the iJtaie Department that no conclusion
Jias yet Oc-t-n reached in the negotiations
Whicn have been in progress between the
department and tne fcjpiuiish Government
respecting the title to certain outlying
Islands in the Philippine archipelago. The
department has from the nrst lnslstea
that tlK'So Islands, though not specifically
included in the ceded territory, were actu
ally part of the cession, but It was not
possible to rcsis-t the courteous request 01
the Spanish Government for a considera
tion of its cJalms and the ascertainment
cif the understandings reached by the
American members ol the Peace Commis
sion on this j"ii:;t.
The War .Department is Btill loath to
permit the ladies of officers' families to
reside in Manila. Following is the form
of a letter which Is beJng used by Sec
retary li3ot In response to all requests
from army women for transportation to
the Philippines:
â¢â¢General Otis has requested th^at the
ladies of officers' families should not be
permitted to go to Manila. The officers
themselves are liame at any time to be
ordered to distant parts of the islands, so
that they are unable to furnish protection
lor their families, and Manila is not yet
v. place where it is proper that an Ameri
can woman should live without protection.
In such cases it would be necessary for
the commanding general to furnish
S"uards, and 1 cannot impose upon him
that necessity. If a lady has male rHa-
Tives living in Manila in whose family she
Â¦will live and who will furnish her protec
tion in the absence of the officer on whoso
accoun-t ehe a?ks transportation the quar
termaster general is authorized to give
lier passage on a transport."
The training ship Dixie, now at Naples,
has been ordered to continue her cruise
through -the Mediterranean Sea and the
Euez canal to Manila. Her original or
ders contemplated her return to the
United States after she had proceeded as
lor as Trieste. Austria. The change of
orders was made in order to fill the va

Fight for the Possession of Little
Conrad Will Not End With the
Court's Decision on
Special Dispatch to The Call.
* NEW YORK. April 14.â Little Conrad
Benjamin Fecker has gained a host of
friends since the dispute for his custody
between his foster-father and foster
mother has become a matter of public
notoriety.
Mrs. Fecker'a counsel does not expect
that the court will deliver the child into
her custody on Monday. He says he will
move that Bennie be remanded to the
care of the society which is now taking
care of him for a period of at least two
weeks, tie will then endeavor. to obtain
from the proper authorities in Wisconsin
legal adoption papers made out in the
name of Mrs. John Kallhorn,, who Is now
Mrs. Fecker. He then hopes to win his
victory.
v Charles Fecker is perfectly content to
have the child remain where he is now;
but in the meantime he is making every
effort, to convince the District Attorney's
office of the unprincipled character of his
wife and to prove that she Is not a proper
person to have the care of the boy. Fecker
to-day passed another hour with Assist
ant District Attorney Collins and his
stenographer. He gave them the namea
of several hotel-keepers, milliners and de
partment store proprietors who have been
swindled by Mrs. Fecker. He also named
at least two wealthy New York residents
who, he avers, have contributed largely
to Mrs. Fecker's support since she has
been In New York. Fecker mentioned a
wealthy banker as the man on whose rec
ommendation Mrs. Fecker gained en
trance as a patron to the Hotel Majestic.
Since It has come to a' game of the
blackening of character, Mrs. Fecker does
not propose to be outdone by her husband.
She and her counsel have nunted up the
record of the trial of Evelyn Holt for the
shooting of Fecker, in 1898, in San Fran
cisco. . Miss Holt testified that in June.
1898, Fecker persuaded her to go to Los
Angeles for a visit; 'that he married his
present wife the same day, but kept her
in ignorance and wrote her endearing let
ters almost dally for six weeks. She
offered In evidence twenty-one of his let
ters, in which he addressed her as "My
Dear Love," "Dear Little Sweetheart
and "Dearest Baby." One, 1 dated three
days after his marriage to Mrs. Fecker,
said:
I was very lonesome and blue after you left
and cried for two days, but am glad I am get
ting: over It now and T hone you are too, hard
as it Is. Hoping to hear from you again soon,
I am with 2.U00.000 kisses, your Â¦ PAPA.
Mrs. Fecker and her counsel to-day gave
out the story that on Friday while she
was in Roblnsdnls office she had been
called â¢up on the telephone by Fecker,
who threatened to shoot her if he did not
get the custody of the boy. Robinson
does not vouch for this story. When
asked about it to-day Fecker said the
story was an absurd Invention, given out
In the hope of influencing the court. He
said he could prove he was In his bedroom
at the hctir his wife professed to have
talked t" him over the telephone.
"As for Evelyn Holt," said Fecker, "she
was a woman and I had loved her. After
she shot me I left the State so as not to
be forced to appear against her. and I
sent a lawyer to her to tell her I would ;
not dispute any defense she chose to
make. The jury disagreed, and she was
set free. I will not now dispute any of
her statements." ..â¢'. , Â«

COMPARISON
OF THE LOSSES
IN TWO WARS
Evidence That the Boer Is
a Better Marksman Than
the Spaniard.
Eighty-Eight Per Cent of the AmAr
ican Death Rate Attributable
to Disease in
Camp.
"WASHINGTON, April 14.â The War De
partment has posted an Instructive state
ment comparing the mortality figures In
the Spanish-American war with those of
the first six months of the present South
African war, the purpose being to show
that the casualties suffered by the Ameri
can troops at the time of their occurrence
(which were regarded in some quarters as
excessive and were the basis of much
criticism) were actually very much less
in number proportionately than those suf
fered by the Urltish army up to date.
As to the British showing, the state
ment covers the returns from October 11
to April 7â nearly six months. There were
309 officers and 3944 men killed in action,
by accident or by wounds and disease.
There were set down as missing and as
prisoners 186 officers and 3722 men and 270
officers and 4934 men were invalided home,
making the British losses, exclusive of
sick and wounded In the hospitals In South
Africa, 765 officers and 12,600 men. It Is
estimated that nearly 10,000 officers and
men are sick and wounded in the hospi
tals, showing a loss in effective strength
since the beginning of the war of about
23,000 men. The number of wounded is not
stated.
During the war with Spain the United
States army lost by death 107 officers and
2803 men. There were wounded 113 officers
and 1464 men.
Only 12 per cent of the American death
rate resulted from wounds or occurred In
battle, while the corresponding ratÂ© for
the British army was 63.13 per cent.
The War Department statement in con
clusion reads as follows:
"The conditions, both military and cli
matic, under which the campaigns were
carried on were so different that It Is
difficult to make any comparisons. The
American campaigns were carried on In
the tropics in midsummer, the most un
favorable season of the year. The dis
eases most prevalent were tropical fever 3.
The climate in the theater of operations
In South Africa Is remarkably healthy.
There was much sickness at Ladysmith.
but that was due to siege conditions and
not to climate. .'V:

They were intended as a menace and a

SOME OF THOSE WHO PLAY PARTS IN THE CHINESE SCANDAL. I
a "committee" of Chinese merchants ask
ed Collector Jackson to order an imme
diate investigation of the interpreter's
misconduct. There were eleven specifica
tions to the accusation*, but for nearly a
year the department at Washington has
not seen fit to investigate any of them,
although Dr. Gardner has been constantly
on duty.
This committee charged him with of
ficial misconduct, in that he willfully mis
translated Chinese written instruments to
the prejudice of Chinese applicants; that
he willfully misinterpreted answers given
by Chinese applicants to questions asked
by inspectors; that he had made an un
reasonable and unlawful search of tha
persons of Chinese applicants for admis
sion; that he had made an unreasonable
and unlawful search of houses, stores,
rooms and homes of Chinese witnesses;
that he had Intimidated and misled Chi-
tatlon companies in the Chinese trade and
traffic when the Government.. suspected
that certain companies were in thÂ«Â» busi
ness of supplying coolies for transporta
tion to this port. The daring operations
of the local ring have therefore created
suspicion at Washtneton, but nothing
definite happened until The' Call ex
posed the plot, related in detail the
organization and- operation of the
ring, and revealed .the tremendous
consequences of thirty-four â¢ months
of evil in a service that the peo
ple of this city demand shall be absolutely
and safely guarded. The character of the
gigantic scheme, the names of the
schemers and the results of their schem
ing are well known, and the national au
thorities should order an Investigation,
which Collector Jackson professes to in
vite. The sensational dispatch from
Washington is as follows:
WASHINGTON. April 14.â The respon
sibility for the admission of Chinese into
the United States through San Francisco
is placed by the Treasury Department
upon John P. Jackson as Collector of the
Port at. that city. An. official who dis
cussed the matter to-day said that In a
communication received at the depart
ment from Mr. Jackson the Collector said
in substance, that in connection with the
admission of Chinese the transportation
companies should be, considered. The de
partment has reason to believe that the
steamship lines connecting San Francisco
with the Far East have agents In China
who induce Chinese to come to this coun
try.. From what the department officials
say, Mr. Jackson apparently believes that
the Government should not put the com
panies to any unnecessary hardships in
the way of compelling them to return at
their own expense natives denied admis
sion. While it is not understood that the
department contemplates taking any ac
tion upon the allegations made with ref
erence to Mr. Jackson, there Is reason to
believe that his official acts are . being
closely scrutinized.
The act of August IS, 1894,. provides that:
"In every case where an alien Is excluded
from admission into the United States un
der any, law or treaty now existing or
hereafter made, the decision of the ap
propriate immigratfon officers, if adverse
to the admission of such alien, shall be
final.. unless reversed on appeal to the
Secretary of the Treasury." This act
makes the officer of- the port the final
judge of the right of an immigrant- to ad
mission, and the practice of the depart-,
ment recognizes this fact. There have
been cases of appeal brought to the at
tention of the department,. and Mr. Jack
son has been generally sustained. Cases
of persons who are admitted cannot, of
course, come before the department, as
there is no one to take an appeal.
About a year ago the department .re
organized Mr. Jackson's office and . as
signed to it some of the ablest men of the
Inspection service. They have been very
careful in investigating the case of each
Chinese immigrant, but their work has
come to naught, because of Mr. Jackson' 3
determination to act "upon his personal
examination of witnesses. Investigations
made by ; treasury inspectors In 1898. in
which customs officers at fall- ports except
San : Francisco heartily co-operated, re
sulted ;in â¢ a material reduction in . the
number, of admissions.
At Malone, N. V., for instance, where
f rom 'Â¦Â¦Â¦ July. 1, 1893, to December 31, 201
Chinamen had been \ admitted and - 29 . had
been 1 rejected, during the remainder, or
that fiscal year 24 only were admitted and
14 â¢ rejected.; There was no such â¢- striking
decrease, Â¦'Â¦ however, .at San Francisco.
During .the i first i half : of ' the ' fiscal year
1893 1405 Chinamen were admitted at this
port and 424 .were denied admission. Dur
ing, the -latter â¢ half of the same year 140
were admitted and; 172 ' were rejected."
There ; has. however, ; been . a slight , reduc
tion in the ; number, of admissions -at < San
Francisco. I During the fiscal year of 1893
3037 of the 'exempt class and 655 laborers
were ; admitted." During.' the ; fiscal year
1899 2543 -of jjthel exempt class, and 1052 la
borers" were permitted i'to enter, and during'
the first eight months. of the present fiscal
year; 2085 of the exempt class have * been
granted admission and 810 have been ' re
fused.entrance.*::. -, ;
.'News comes also from -Washington of a
<â¢ â 1| 3 HE University of California rifle
?team defeated the San Francisco
II : police rifle team by a score of 419 to
. _.. 413 yesterday, at the Shell Mound
range. The -.. conditions were ten
men to each team, ten shots to each
man, 200- yards on the Blunt target. Each
team was allowed to shoot the rifle in Â¦
general use by its company. The police
entered the contest armed with the 44.40
Winchester repeaters, while the students
shot the Springfield musket.
Both organizations lined up for the con
test with confidence, and all through
there was but little advantage on either
side. Smith Carr and Harry Hook, the
veteran shots of the police, held up well,
but some of the others lost their grip and
went to pieces. Some of the" university
boys seemed to get rattled as the con
test progressed.
Excitement ran high when W. Frick
stad of the University of California and
F. C. Howard of the police entered the
shooting stall for their scores. In truth,
the match hung on their work. The uni
versity boy, who has been shooting but a
year, showed that the strain was great,
but he held himself together and defeated '
Howard by eight points, as well as mak
ing the highest score of the day â 47 out of
a possible 50. â¢ This gave the university
team the victory by six points.
C. H. Gorrill engineered the student
team to success, while Ed Leonard acted
as chief for the police. Captain Baldwin
of the army officiated as referee.
At the conclusion of the contest the
students invited their guests to Berkeley,
where they served the best banquet that
Berkeley could afford. The scores made

WOODLAND. April 14.â J. H. Davis,
charged with violating the anti-pool ordi

setting forth that "J. H. Davis is now
under my care and suffering from an at

to leave San Francisco or do any traveling,

If these charges had been made In good
faith they would have been pressed long
ago. But they were not made in good
faith. The "committee" was the agent of
the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, and
the motive of the charges was to Intimi
date, the interpreter, whose conduct had
been and is above reproach. Â£
The expose of the plot to Import whole
sale to this city Chinese slaves has added
another startling phase to the outrageous
traffic In coolief. Dealing in women slaves
has been an exceptionally profitable busi
ness to those who engage in it. While the
risk is great the profit Is also great and
some of the local slave dealers have made
enormous fortunes from It. When the
United States Supreme Court, therefore,
opened a comparatively easy avenue for
the importation of unforunate women the
slave dealers were not slow to accept It.
But in the decision of the Supreme Court
there Is a certain justice.
Chinese merchants should be permitted
to bring their bona fide wives Into this
country, -for nothing Is more cruel and
opposed to all right views of social policy
than to prohibit them the company of
thnlr bona fide wives. It Is to be lamented,
however, that the corruption and greed of
the American officials and the avarice of
the Chinese, themselves will make -use
of this right, to bring the bona flde wives
into this country as a means of Import
ing Chinese slave women to the vile pur-
to take part In the international Olym
pian games at Paris â¢ and the English
championship events in London. This
was decided by the authorites at the
university to-day and Director Stagg was

ADDED TO THE
LIST BY SOFALA
Diderot the Only Starter
Able to Give the Filly
an Argument.
Four Winning Favorites at Tanforan
Park â Ella Boland and Mort
gage Score for Burns &
Waterhouse.
Bookmaker Barney Schrelber's wizard
filly Sofala has begun to be looked upon
as well nigh infallible in these parts; In
fact so much so that only a trio of young
sters took up the Issue with her for the
Western stake at Tanforan yesterday.
Two of theseâ Diderot and St. Ricaâ ran
coupled, representing Atkin & Lottrldge,
while J. Naglee Burk again tried the fast
but unlucky Impromptu. The distance
was live furlongs, and under the condi
tions Sofala got in with 120 pound?, five
pounds less than she carried in the Geb
hard handicap. She was installed a2to 5
choice, and, as in most of her former per
formances, led throughout, beating Dide
rot a length in 1:01 Va- Impromptu, a slow
beginner, took the small end of the prize.
The value of the stake to the winner was
51820.
Cromwell, In the last, was the only high
priced -winner of the day, the other events
going to four favorites and a second
choice.
Dan Honlg's fast mare Theory proved a
good repeater by picking up 126 pounds
and taking the opening five and a half
furlong sprint in an ordinary gallop. She
closed a slight choice over True Blue, and
led from the jump. The latter finished in
the place four lengths ahead of Gold Bug,
a 200 to 1 outsider.
Klla Boland, the recent purchase of
Burns & Waterhouse. enjoyed an easy
thing of It in the six furlong run follow
ing. A 7 to 10 choice, the filly galloped her
company to a standstill, leading Esper
ando over the mark a quarter of a dozen
lengths. Morlnga ran third.
The mile handicap was captured In lm-
poses which are the sole reason for their
coming to this country.
There Is, however, a test which may be
readily applied that will infallibly dis
tinguish the bona fide wife of a Chinese
merchant from the class of women Im
ported for vile uses. Many generations
ago during the civil uprising in China a
woman connected with the palace and the
ruling dynasty was outraged by one of
the boat people. These boat people num
ber many millions, who for ages have
lived on boats on the great rivers of
China. They formed, by reason of their
method of life and calling, a distinct class
before this occurrence of which a lady of
the royal family was the victim. At the
time of this outrage the Chinese Govern
ment entered a perpetual decree that all
the boat people should, from that time
on, be of no family and entirely separ
ated from the Confucian Philosophy, that
they should not be permitted to bury, on
land, but their dead should be thrown
Into the water. Of course, ancestor wor
ship was denied to them and the keeping
of the records of their families was for
bidden. It was also decreed that all
females born to the boat people should
be by law dedicated to prostitution from
their birth.
When age overtakes these women they
are compelled to row the boats on the riv
ers, do all the drudgery and the menial
and servile work: and their earnings are
so Bmall in the Infamous calling to which
the law dedicates, them that they must
perform this drudgery and' menial labor
In order that they may exist at all.
For this reason they like to leave China.
They are sold by their parents or sell
themselves to exporters, and they are sent
to the Straits Settlements, Australia, the
Philippine Islands, the United States.
Mexico and all other places where there
are large colonies of Chinese coolies. As
a rule they are better fed, sheltered and
dressed abroad than they are in China.
Their earnings also are larger and after
a few years they are able to purchase
their freedom by repaying to their owners
their original price and the cost of their
exportation. Their earnings thereafter
belong to themselves, and in a few years
they are able to accumulate sufficient
money to return to China and live without
performing drudgery.
Here, now. Is the basis of the trade In
Chinese female slaves; the anxiety of
the women themselves to go abroad and
the profit In exporting them gained by
their owners. Formerly the owners could
afford to pay as an official bribe $SOO

ALAMEDA BOATING
CLUB'S NIGHT FIESTA
AC^AMEDA, April 14.â Gliding through
the dark waters of the tidal basin
last evening was a lons line of il
luminated boats, all crowded with
guests or the Alameda Boating Club. It
was a "moonlight picnic."
Leading the pageant was the powerful
little launch The King, and followinj,
came the graceful yachts the Star, the
Queen, Favorite, Ralph B, Lucille, Dream.
Flying Fish. Clover Leaf, Thelma. Spray.
Sloth, Major, Maude J, Defender. Hal
cyon, Ktoile and Flush. Tacked at the
end of these craft was a gross of bobbing
rowboats. Each boat was gayly deco
rated Nvtth vari-colored Chinese lanterns.
After the disembarkation the picnickers
assembled in the clubhouse and enjoyed a
refreshing collation. The lateness of the
hour did not permit of a programme, but
happy remarks were made by a few of t..e
club's officers, who were called upon by
Toastmaster W. B. Hinchman. .â
In charge of the successful picnic
were W. B. Hinchman, F. M. Hunter and
W. G. Hansen. The officers of the Ala
meda Boating Club are: Charles H. Smith,
president; Charles G. Pesoli. vice presi
dent; W. B. Hinchman, secretary: David
Greenleaf, treasurer; John Lewis, captain.
The bay during the afternoon was cov
ered by flitting boats conveying guests to
and from the receptions held by John D.
Spreckels on board the Lurline and by
Commodore McCarthy on the squadron's
flagship, the Ramona. The owners of the
various pleasure craft were busy during
the afternoon extending the hospitality of
their trim vessels and explaining nautical
terms to the inquiring fail* sex.
In the evening an informal hop was
plven In the ballroom over the clubhouse.
The scene presented in the ballroom was
unique and characteristic Numbers of
vari-colored signal flags draped tastefully
on ceiling: and walls gave a refreshing
tone of color, while the soft light shone
through masses of shrubbery on the mov
ing: forms of the dancers, the majority of
wnom wore yachting costumes. The
United States steamship McCulloch, the
Rush and the Mac Arthur .received their
full quota of visitors during the afternoon
and evening, large boat parties being
formed to visit tlio Government craft.
The opening of the present season gives
promise of an excellent summer's yacht
ins. That Interest In the sport has taken
an impetus was evidenced by the formid
able fleet of trim pleasure craft floating
at anchor off the Sausalito shore. Among

Blanche Pelxotto has been granted
the degree of Doctor of Philosophy
by the University of California.

California.
She graduated In ISM. and Introduced
that year the outdoor custom of spectac
ular productions for class day. Prior to

in the open, but none of any special in
terest. She was very popular and con
nected with many college functions and
organizations. . â¢ â¢ .Â¦_ - ..
Upon her graduation she went to Paris,
under Â»he direction of Professors Moses.
Bacon and Paget, to study the socialists*
doctrines. She remained there for two
years studying carefully the history and
customs. Her. thesis, which was read by
Professor Bacon, Is said to be one of the
deepest and best ever offered to the uni
versity It covered the history of France
from 1715 to the present day. Its title was
"Relation of the - Principles of French
Revolution to the Theories of Modern
French Socialism."
This morning she delivered an outline
of her studies .to-be, examined, and the
professors cross-examined her. -The ex
amination consumed an hour and a half,
after which Â¦ she â¢ was , officially made a
Doctor of Philosophy^ _ , .-->_.>

OAKLAND AND BERKELEY
HIGH SCHOOLS RUSH
BERKELEY, April 14.â The basebati
game to-day between the Oakland anti
Central High School teams ended In a
free-for-all fight. There has always been
keen rivalry between the Oakland and
Berkeley high schools for athletic honors.
At\the morning game, which was played
on the college campus, the Berkeley boys
took sides with the Central High School
in "joshing" Oakland. The retorts grad
ually waxed bitter, and when one of the
Oakland boys snatched a red and gold hat
belonging to one of the Berkeley rooters
a rush ensued.
For over an hour the streets In the vi
cinity of the campus were thronged with
hatless. boys who were fighting one an
other. â
As the Impromptu rush took place on
the college campus the university author
ities may take some action In the prem
ises.

San Francisco Republicans Will As
sist Santa Clara Stalwarts in
Winning Their Fight.
A conference of presidents and secreta
ries of Republican clubs of San Francisco
and Alameda counties took place last
evening at the rooms of the Union League
Club, Palace Hotel. A. G. Booth called
the meeting to order, announcing that the
conference was to ascertain the number
of delegates that would attend the State
convention at Los Angeles April 27. T. D.
Riordan was elected chairman and Mr.
Cory secretary,
A telegram from Los Angeles was read.
The. message conveyed expressions of
hearty greeting from the promoters of the
convention to the clubs of the bay cities
and promised all a cordial welcome
April 27.
A telegram was read announcing that
forty-five delegates from San Jose would
go to Los Ajigeles. The message con
tained a request that the San Francisco
delegates should join the delegation from
Santa Clara County in an effort to have
San Jose chosen as the place for holding
the convention In 1902. A motion was
made and carried that the delegates from
this city be requested to support San Jose.
President Lukens of the Republican Al
liance, Oakland, sent word that the Alli
ance would send twelve delegates and join
the clubs of San Francisco in upholding
Republican principles In the coming cam
paign.
Reports were submitted from various
clubs of the city regarding the election
of delegates, but definite statements as to
the number sure to attend the convention
were not elicited.
George R. Fletcher gave evidence of his
desire to impart enthusiasm to the -Laurel
Republican Club, of which he is presi
dent, and said that he was willing to con
tribute $10 to assist in defraying the ex
penses of a mass-meeting of delegates.
Mr. Fletcher only recently obtained
knowledge that a convention was to be
held In Lcs Angeles, and when his club
elected delegate? he was not advised of
the apportionment, and as a result the
club failed to elect as many delegates as
Its membership warranted." Another elec
tion may be called to supply the de-
On motion of C. W. Kyle, presidents and
secretaries were advised to report on or
before April 20 to James. M. Oliver, sec
retary. Claus Spreckels building, the
names of delegates who would attend the
convention. Should the list of names pre
sented to Mr. Oliver establish the facÂ»
that one hundred delegates will go from
San Francisco end Alameda steps may be
taken to engage a special train and thus
secure a further reduction of fare.
The Afro-American League reported the
election of the following delegates: John
C. Rivers, T. B. Morton, A. Strather,
Rev. J. H. Kelley and George W. Jackson.
Colonel Whlteslde. of the McKinley
Veteran Soldiers' and Sailors' Republican
Club, reported the election of delegates*
as follows: C. Mason Klnne. C. W. Gor

of his brothers, who are at present In
New York, to-day filed a contest In San

STRIKING ITALIANS
THREATEN TROUBLE
New York Militia Called Out to Pre
vent a Riot at the Croton
Bam.
CROTOX LANDING. N. T.. April 14.â
There is plenty of trouble brewing at the
Croton Dam between the striking Ital
ians, who are clamoring for more wages,
and the contractors, who are steadfast in
refusing any concessions. All day to-day
it was expected that bloody work would
occur, but not a stone was thrown nor a
shot fired.
Sheriff Malloy of Westehester County,
who has the responsibility of protecting
the property In the district, had 150 depu
ties armed with revolvers guarding the
works all day. Only once did the depu
ties have a chance to show their author
ity. This was when an attempt was
made to pull out a locomotive from the
roundhouse to draw a load of coal up to
the steam pump. The strikers, about SOO

strikers allowing outsiders to fill their

on Monday morning when the working

ONE LIFE LOST IN
THE ESSEN COAL MINE
As It Was Pay Day All but Three
Had Left When the Fire
Started.
PITTSBURG. April 15.â The fire !n the
Es?en coal mine Xo. 3, at Hazelton, on
the Pittsburg and Youghlogheny railroad,
caused the death of one miner. Venzel
Sternad. The first report was that six
teen men were in the mine, who were sup
posed to have perished, but now that the
lire is extinguished and the extreme ex
citement over, it develops that only three
men were in the mine when the fire start
ed yesterday afternoon. It being payday
the men had quit work between 11 and 12
o'clock, leaving only Sternad. Frank M.
Lathick and a driver, name not known, in
the pit.
The fire started, it Is supposed, from the
electric pump, caused by the burning out
of a motor. Sternad and Lathick were
at work about 300 feet beyond the pump,
over three-quarters of a mile from the
mine entrance and knew nothing of the
fire until Lathick started forward to get
some orders from the fire boss. Coming
to the fire he wrapped his head In his coat
and made a dash through the flames and
smoke. He succeeded in reaching the pit
mouth, where he fell exhausted. Sternad
has not yet been reached by the rescuers,
but it is a certainty that he has perished.
The third man escaped easily, because he
wa.Â« on the outside of the fire and followed
Lathick in his rush.

MILLIONAIRE
FATALLY SHOT
BY A WOMAN
Rufus Wright, Manufacturer
of Bicycle Tires, Near
Death.
Ccicagt) Hotel Tragedy Declared by
the Principals to Have Been
the Besult of an Acci
dent.
Â«
CHICAGO. April 34. â Rufus Wright, a
millionaire, and treasurer of the firm of
Morgan & Wright, bicycle tire manufac
turers, is lying at the point of death in
a room of the I>eiand Hotel, phot through
the neck by a. bullet from the revolver of
Mrs. I^ouipa I-ottridge of Pawpaw. Mich.
The shooting occurred in the apartments
occupied by the woman, and she and the
victim declare it was accidental. The
police were not apprised of the tragedy
until two hours after it had occurred, and
when Detective Sergeant Burns arrived
at the hotel he found Mr?. Lottrldge
there. He at once placed her under ar
rest and she is being detained at the Har
rison-street police etation. A friend who
had e pent several hours with her previous
to the shooting was arrested. She gives
her name as Mrs. Ida Koss.
Much mystery attaches to the shooting.
Both the victim and Mrs. Lottridge per
sist in Faying It was accidental, while the
police h<"'!d that from the location of the
wound there is doubt as to the truth of
the declaration. Captain Colleran, the
chief of detectives. Bays the stories of
the two, while they tally as regards the
cause of the phooting. differ in details.
The story told by the woman Is that
Wright, who had ppent two hours In. the
company of Mrs. Lottridge, tried to take
from her a revolver which she had taken
from her satchel with a view to getting
h!s opinion on it. In the struggle whicn
followed for the possession of the weapon
It was discharged and the bullet lodged
in the left tide of Wright's neck. .The
shot wa* not heard by any one in the ho
tel and the flrst known of the occurrence,
Â¦was when Mrs. Lottridge called Hugh
Will!*, a bellboy, ami told him to notify
I>r. J. D. Hammond, the house physician.
Â«f the shooting. The doctor hurried to
the room where the wounded man lay,
and. while he worked over him, Mrs. Lot
tridge s=toÂ«d by and watched the efforts
to pave the life of the wounded man.
Mrs. Lottridge was found In a room
r.*xt to that In which the wounded man
jay when thÂ«Â» detectives arrived. She ap-
peared to be under the influence of wine
and made no resistance when Detective
Burns told her she was under arrest. She
simply said the shooting was accidental,
and expressed her willingness to accom
pany the officer to jail. At the central
police station she positively refused to
talk of the shooting.
The woman registered at the hotel on
April 11. when she arrived In company
with Mrs. Ida Koss, who was arrested
after the shooting. Mrs. Lottridge Is a
widow of not very prepossessing appear
ance. She Is nearly Fix feet tall and
â¢weighs about ISS pounds. She told the
chief of detectives that she had been ac
quainted with Wright for the last three
years, and that on every one of her visits
to Chicago he had called upon her.
Mrs. Koss. who denies all knowledge of
the shooting, declared that she and Mrs.
Lottrtdge had several drinks In the room
of the latter, and when Mrs. Koss was
about to lea.ye the room Mrs. Lottrldge
announced that she intended to send for
Mr. Wright.
According to the statement of Manager
Dabb of the hotel, orders for wine were
plentiful after the arrival of Wright.
Several coolers in which the bottles were
sent to the room were found by Detective
Burns. The orders ceased about 2
o'clock, a half hour before the bellboy
Â¦was called to go after the surgeon.
When Dr. Hammond took the revolver
with which the shooting was done, Mrs.
L.ottridge attempted to take It from him
and struck him several times on the face.
The condition of Wright at midnight
â¢was critical and the physicians were un
able to predict the outcome. Dr. Ham
mond expressed the opinion, however,
that the wound would prove mortal.

Few Bruises Were the Only Injuries

long Tumble of Robert
Fry's Daughter.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway. April 11.
The three-year-o!d daughter of Robert
G. Fry. residing at 1711 Fifth street, fell
twenty feet this afternoon from a second
story window at her home and escaped
serious injury.
The mother had been working In the
rear of the house, when she was attracted
by cries. Rushing to the front yard she
found the child writhing in pain. Dr. M.
Rinehart made an examination and
found no broken bones or any evidence of
serious internal injury. He administered
soothing draughts, and directed that thÂ«>
baby be kept quiet. There appeared no
symptom to indicate that serious results
would ensue from the fall.
The little girl had been playing In the
upper part of the house, and while look
ing out of the window lost her balance
and fell headforemost out. There was
nothing to break the fall, and the sur
geon thought the child's escape from even
a broken limb was marvelous. The baby
was not rendered unconscious. There
were some superficial bruises on ths
child's body, but that was apparently all
that resulted from the fall. Fry la a

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 15, 1900.
SWITCHED OFF
HIS PATIENTS
Dr. Max Klonk to Sue the Pacific
Telephone Company for
Damages.
â¢Makes the Common Complaint That the Cor
poration's Employes Misled the Public,
WHETHER or not the loss sus
tained by subscriber? of the Pa
cific Telephone and Telegraph
Company. through the negll
pencÂ© of that corporation's employes,
*hall ultimately be borne by the sub
scriber or tha company that was respon
sible- tor the same will be finally de
termined in a suit which will be filed next
Monday In the Justice Court. Dr. Max
Klonk. who resides at Sutter and Stock
ton streets, \rtll appear as plaintiff in the
action and will demand J209 damages for
k!s alleged actual loss through the ncgli
rence of the telephone company's em
ployes. ThÂ« suit will raige many inter
Â«stlr.g legal points and even if thÂ« court
determines that the plaintiff cannot re
cover an absorbing etory of the com
pany's negligence and of the manner in
Â¦which pecuniary loss is sustained by rea
son of the same will be told under oath
on thÂ« witness Ktand.
Notwithstanding the constant com
plaints of inefficient service that have
nÂ«en registered with the telephone com
pany, this is the first time one ha^ been
registered against it for damages sus
tained through its negligence. George
H. Perry, who represents the plalnt'.ff.
made th*Â« following statement yesterday
rejrardir.g the causes that led his client
to Institute an action against the com
pany:
"On th* first of the year." he said. "Dr.
Klor.k had a telephone placed in his resi-
dence. Since that time he has received
numerous complaints from patients and
particularly from prospective patients
that they were unable to communicate
with him by telephone, sis thpy were in
formed that his phone had been taken
out and again that Tie had never been one
of :he company's subscribers.
"Through this means Dr. Klonk lost
several patients, but the idea of. institut
ing action against the company did not
occur to him until early this week, when
a local German society, of which he is
the phrsician, informed him that mem
bers had complained at being unable to
resirh him by telephone. Dr. Klonk's
telephone has never been out of his resi
dence since the first of the year. We
then went to work and have six witnesses
whom we will place on the stand and who
will swear that through the constant as
sertion of the company that -Dr. Klonk
was not a subscriber they were forced
to look for another physician closer to
th^ir homes."
Although the amount involved In the
proposed suit is small, the final Judgment
of the court on Dr. Klonk's claim will be
of special interest to the people of this
city. Girls, wearied and ofttimes ill, are
kept waiting at the switchboards, and
doubtless this fact will bo the proved
cause of the loss sustained by the sub
scriber. If other causes are proven his
damage cannot be made the more or
less, but it is safe to assume that if
Judgment is obtained by him the errors
on the part of the company's employe?
will become more Infrequent and thetr
hours of drudgery materially reduced.

FOR CONVENTION OF 1902
STRONG HARES
MAKE DOGS RUN
THEIR FASTEST
Good Day's Sport With the
Leash on Field at Union
Park.
t
The Curtis Dogs Luxor and Vulcan
Are Installed Favorites for the
Champion and the Open
Stake.
-^ â i
A large consignment of strnnc harrs |
surprised the coursing men at Union Park
yesterday and provided exceptionally
good sport in the run-down of tho re
serve stake for this time of the year. The
I majority of the trial 3 took thÂ© dogs well
across the field and afforded them an op
portunity to do some work. The park
management is trying the experiment of
keeping the hares off the field, where they
might feed on the grass, and. limiting
them to a grain diet.
Vulcan and For Glory are the most
pronounced favorites for the reserve
stake, the latter having been backed off
the board. Hot Haste, Greenball. Over
ture, Sir Pasha, Rock Island King, Uncle
Fuller, Boney Boy, Vandal, Cash, Diablo
and St. Anthony are also in demand in
the order named.
For the champion stake, which will be j
run this afternoon, Luxor is the natural
favorite, and after him Eugene Geary's
young dog Falo Alto.
It was generally a day for favorites
yesterday, although sufficient long shots
won to keep the bettors guessing. O. X..
Capitol was the llrst to upset calcula
tions, winning from Kid McCoy at odds
of 5 to 1. Aeneas beat Echo at 3 to 1;
Jesse Moore beat Sweet Lips at 2 to 1;
Royal Bush beat Miss Cable at 2 to 1;
McKinley beat Victor King at 5 to 3;
Thornhill beat Metallic at 2 to 1, and
Moonstone beat Mollie R at 5 to 1.
Overture, the English dog, made a fa
vorable Impression upon his first appear
ance at Union Park. He led the Aus
tralian dog Soft Goods three lengths anu
showed himself clever at working the
hare. He will meet Auckland in his first
course to-day, when a better line can be
obtained as to his speed. Auckland was
unfortunate yesterday in having two un
decided courses before he gained the de
cision over Athena. Temple showed good
form, as did Judge P. J. Rellly's Plough
Boy, another imported dog.
Russell, Allen & Wilson sent their new
dog Victor Boy to the slips for the first
time. Ho was brought out from the East
with the idea of pos^bly winning the
John Grace challenge cup. The change
of climate affected him, and he has been
kept in the background until the present
time. He met and defeated Maher &
Reid's Firm Foe yesterday by a score of
4 to 2, and gave promise of better per
formances to come.
Judge P. J. Riley's Willful Widow had
no difficulty in defeating Belle of Rich
mond. The latter stopped in the field
and watched her opponent course the
hare without making a move to assist
her. The results in detail, with Judge
John Grace's official scores, follow:

to get out first, and here is where the
trouble commenced. Just as Hiller was
climbing out of the small boat it gave a
sudden lurch, which sent him incontin
ently Into the water. Hiller floundered
around, but luckily did not sink.
All was confusion for a moment, but
the men on the schooner were equal to
the occasion. A block and tackle was se
cured, and' on the hook being lowered It
was attached to the stoutest part of Hil
ler's clothing and he was gradually hauled
up on the deck of the schooner. There
were no clothes large enough to fit him
on board, so he was wrapped up in this
mainsail until his garments had a chance
to dry out. As soon as they were ready
Hiller refused to go back in the small
boat, and one of his friends had to row
ashore and secure a launch, which landed
him safely, and then Hiller rode home in
a hack, a drier but a wiser man.
FAT MAN SAVED WITH
A BLOCK AND TACKLE
Heroic Measures Used on JVC. Hiller,
a Market-Street Cigar-Dealer,
Who Fell in the Bay.
Jules C. Hiller, the Market street cigar
dealer, met with a mishap last Friday
afternoon which has caused no end of
amusement among his numerous friends.
A number of young men of this city
stricken with the Nome fever Invited Hil
ler. who weighs in the neighborhood of
400 pounds, to pay a visit to the schooner
Emma, which is lying off Harrison street
wharf. A skiff was hired and the party
headed for the schooner with Hiller safely
stov.ed in the stern in order to make the
rowing all the easier.
The skiff reached the vessel without any
mishap, though the top of the stern was
within a hair's breadth of the water ow
ing to the exceeding avoirdupois pos
sessed by Hiller. When the skiff went
alongside the ship it was considered the
safest thing to back up and allow Hiller
to little Master Deane, who; In complete
Japanese girl's costume, sat upon an Ori
entaily cushioned and draped divan and
distributed the preuv favors to the par
ticipants in the grand march, which was
leu by Mrs. Deane and Mr. Wells.

number of visitors from the local camps.
There were initiated fifteen candidates,
seven of whom came over from San Ra
fael to be introduced Into the mysteries
of the order. The work was performed by
the degree team with that .perfection
which has gained for it many words of
praise. San Francisco Camp now has a
membership of 120 and at the meeting re
ferred to twelve applications were receiv
ed. After the ceremonies of initiation all
present were invited by the camp's social
committee to the banquet hall, where a
sumptuous spread was enjoyed. â¢ Neighbor
Donelley entertained with songs and a
number of the neighbors were called upon
for responses to toasts. From the re
marks made It look very much as if thk

this city.
Golden Gate Camp had initiations Mon
day night and will have more on the
night of the 23d Inst.. when the work will
be performed by the degree team, and
those Woodmen who will 'attend will be
repaid for the time they spend in seeing
this team do Its work. v.
Tamalpais Camp has of late, under good
of the order, introduced a feature of dis
cussion of public topics. The latest of
these was a discussion on the British-Boer
war and the causes that led up to It. A
great deal of information on the subject
was Imparted, as the Boer side was pre
sented by Laurence Vincent at one meet
ing and the other side was presented at
the following one by Dr. M. B. Estes.
There is considerable activity in all the
local camps and in the Circle of Wood

the ceremonies of unveiling a monument
erected to the memory of the late Charles
M. Schwerln, one of the'eharter members
of the camp, over his remains in O<!d Fel

of fraternity between camp and circle is
one that Is not excelled in any other or
ganization.

CHICAGO. April 14.â May wheat opened ?&@
He depressed from Thursday at C6H@66c and
advanced to ttViC, at which price It closed, un
changed from Thursday. Instead of the stop
loss selling which many had looked for at this
point commission houses were able to produce
many buying orders which had been lying
around for woeks. Under this stimulus and
the strength of corn and provisions, together
with a mild reiteration of the damage reports
in France, the advance took place without a
material setback. Considerinc the closing of
many markets and the curtailment of news the
session was fairly active. Monday's statistics
are expected to be bullish rather than bearish,
but not strikingly so. The early loss was due
principally to the fine weather.
The corn market opened easier, May 1 i 1 5'4c
lower at 3*%Â®3J.%c to 3s%@3SHc The influences
were purely local, there being nothing in the
way of news to stimulate the market and the
shipping business was unimportant. May closed
strong *Â»6'.sc over Thursday at 39<Â»c.
Ob'.s were quiet and the range narrow. May
closed >4Â«i%c under Thursday. The holidays in
other markets curtailed business.
There was not a soft epot In the provision
market. Hogs were decidedly higher at the
yards, forming the chief bull Influence. There
â¢vas profit taking, but such sales were readily
absorbed at nearly all rates. The buying of
lard was the feature. May pork closed 20c up.
May lard 27',-ic improved and May ribs 22',ic
better.

SUNDAY, APRIL 13.
rect operation South America has drawn on the
United States In liquidation of an English debt.
The closing of Important/ stock exchanges here
and abroad for two days last week, of course,
deferred developments that might otherwise
have come to a head, but some bankers figure
that the rise in sterling will not Justify ex
ports until a figure of 4.R9 is reached. The
outlook aw respects gold phlpments Is not creat
ing apprehension. On the contrary, banking
interests are Indifferent and point out that if
actual exports follow the incident will merely
reveal the financial strength of the United
States. During the week Just ended money was
drawn from New York to interior points and
domestic exchange is at a discount in many
cities, whereas it ruled at a decided premium
only two weeks ago.

Associated 'Banks' Statement.
NEW TOHK. April 14.â The Financier says
The statement Â«t the Associated lianks of
New York City for the week ending April 14 Is
more in accord with known facts regarding cur
rent operation* than the exhibit of a week ago.
The heavy gains In tafh, due to treasury dis
bursements, are reflected In the Increase ot bljc
million* specie and legal tenders, although the
detailed ttau-mÂ«-nt of individual institutions
fhowe that thin money, tor the mo*t part, has
lx-<-n abs>orb*-d by one or two larger Jn*tl tut lone.
The expansion of SG, 108,200 in loans is only mod
erate constdeftng the activity !n epeculatkin
a.nd the borrowisc in this market *>n hypothe
cated securities and on sterling. The deposit
account rose $H.&33,Vi0 as the result of the cafch
and loan increase*, end thin explains why. In
the face Of a ra*h cÂ»ln of over six millions,
th<* eurpluK reserve is only about three million*
htpher than a week ag-o. National bank circu
lation show? a Kteariy expansion and the total
r.otee cf banks outstanding now reaches $21,029,-
SOCL It 1* Â«;uile probable that the full limit has
not l<e*>n reached in ,this respect and that a
heai-y Increase will JvÂ» made before six months
elapte. The proÂ«r>ectÂ« Â«t present favor a con
tinued easy merket and this In turn Invited at

responded. ,
