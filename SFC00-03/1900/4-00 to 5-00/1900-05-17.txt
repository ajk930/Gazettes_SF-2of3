the murderer3 of Missionary Brooks. Fif
teen men were tried for the crime hefcre
the Provincial Judge at Chimanfu and C.
W. Campbell. British Consul. It was de
veloped at the trial that only three were
guilty of the actual killing, and one of
these dealt the fatal blow. This one.
being most culpable in the Chinese crim
inal code, was beheaded in the presence of
the British â¢ Consul. Another, who was
only a shade lighter In . guilt. , was sen
tenced to strangulation at the autumn
Assizes. A third was sentenced to life im
prisonment, and four others to ten years'
imprisonment. Four head men from the
villages to which Mr. Brooks had been

dismissed forever from office. Two village
elders of the hamlet near the scene of
the murder are to pay the cost of a me
morial tablet to be erected at the scene
of .. the murder at the cost'of 500 4 taels.
The Governor of the ' province has, paid

his* school at Canterbury. England, and to
cover, the \ loss of the Episcopal church's
native ' Christians in . that district at the

North j China News makes . the sensational
statement that the three murderers- found
substitutes to suffer the death penalty ana
life imprisonment in their stead. The au
thorities permitted them to buy their lives
back. The man who delivered tho blow
that killed Mr. Brooks was sentenced to
have his head cut off. For ROOO he got an

House Proceedings.
WASHINGTON. May IS.â The House
j accomplished little to-day, besldea passing
the Senate bill to Incorporate the Ameri

was made with the Alaskan code bill
\ owing to the inability of the two sides to
agree as to the time to be allowed for
general debate. The conference report on
the District of Columbia appropriation bill
was returned after extended debate.
SUBSTITUTES WHO
WERE EXECUTED
LONDON, May 17.â Tho Daily Express
publishes a three-column New York epe
cial signed by Patrick O'Connor, who
crossed the Atlantic with the Boer dele
rates on the Maasdam under pretense of
being an Irish-American and a Boer sym
pathizer. As a matter of fact. Mr. O'Con
nor understands the Dutch language, and
he claims to have overheard much private
conversation. In the course of which Mr.
Wolmarens Is reported to have said to
Mr. Fischer:
"I think we should bÂ« careful of what
we Eay to this man, as he may be a spy.
Are you Fure he is an American?"
Mr. Fischerâ There is no doubt of it. I
can tell by his accent.
Mr. Wes?e!?â It would never do, of
course, for the British to know that we
are really in the last extremity, or for
him to know that we are thinking of
staying in America.
Tbtn, resuming the English language.
Mr. Fischer began by blaming Cecil
Rhode-, for the bringing on of the war.
He said:
"I have not a FhaCow of doubt that Sir
Arthur Mllner was rent to South Africa
to prepare for the spoliation of the Boer
republics, by force if necessary. The
franchise ruse was al! humbug. Presi
dent Kruger conceded so much at the
Bloemfontein conference that Mllner was
In mortal fear lest all his requests ehould
be granted and lest he should thereby lose
the chance of annexing the Transvaal."
Mr. Wolmarens said to Mr. KLÂ«cher. In
Dutch: "Do you think we had better tell
him how Kruger broke off tho confer
ence?" ,
Mr. Fischerâ No.
Mr. Woolroarens in Dutch â Our posi
tion Just now is precisely that of Jame
eon at the time of the raid. He expected
Johannesburg to rise to his assistance. He
expected the same of Cape Colony and
PATRICK O'CONNOR
ACTED AS A SPY
Natal. We are bitterly disappointed. Tell
him how Schreiner deceived us. "
Mr. Fischerâ He knows well, as well
as we do, that Schreiner is loyal to Great
Britain.
Resuming Knglish, Mr. Fischer ea!d:
"We are going to win the war If it take<Â«
years."
Addressing Mr. Wessels, and using
Dutch. Mr. Fischer then said: "We had
better not say too much. We are getting
badly beaten now. We are going to
America in the hope of obtaining the
friendly help of the United States in the
cause of peace. That Is what we will say
to the public. As a matter of fact, we
have no hope whatever. We have no cut
and dried programme."
Mr. Fischer went on to say that the
brother of Mr. Wessels. who happened to
be In the United States and who was act
ing In conjunction with Montagu White,
believed that some sort of peace would be
arranged, but. If the delegates failed in
the United States tbe Boers, Mr Fischer
declared, would still not give in,

SHOTS FIRED FROM
BEHIND A WHITE FLAG
LONDON. May 16.-The War Office
posts the following dispatch from Lord '
Roberts, under date of Kroonstad, May
15:
"Two officers and six men of Prince Al
fred's Guards, while out foraging yester
day a few miles from Kroonstad. visited
a farm flying a white flag, the owner of
which surrendered himself, with arms
and ammunition. They then approached
another farm, also flying a white flag.
When wlhin forty yards of the inclosuro
they were fired upon by fifteen or sixteen
Boers concealed behind the farrn wall.
Two of the 'men were killed, Lieutenant
F. B. Walton was wounded and Lieuten
ant W. B. Eveston and two non-commis
sioned officers were taken prisoners. , The
owner of J.he farm states that the Boers
threatened to shoot him when he protest
ed against their making improper use of
the white flag."
UFGES IMMEDIATE
CANAL BUILDING
WASHINGTON. May 16.â The
Senate Committee on Inter
oceanic Canals to-day, through
Its chairman. Senator Morgan,
presented its written report on
the Nicaragua bill. The report Includes
the statements of Admiral Walker and
other members of the commission ap
pointed to investigate the various routes
and elÂ«o the conclusion of the committee
with reference to both the Nicaragua and
the Panama routes.
The committee takes strong position
against the proposition to build the canal
via the Panama, route, paying for the
Â¦work already done by the French. The
declaration is made that the Panama
Ccmpany Is practically without assets, ex
cept those inclufied in the Panama Rail
road. â ._ - : "Â«_'
"They say." says the report, "they nave
assets that a committee of experts has
valued at $90,000,000. They make no offer
or fetiggestion as to what they would take
fcr It. The lowest sum a.t which they es
timate the cost of completing their canal
Is $35,000,000; so that, in entering that com
bine, we would go in on the basis of $1S5.
000,000 for the completed canal on the
plan of three levels. If that plan Is adopt
ev, against $138,000,000, which is the high
est estimate any engineer has placed on
the Nicaragua canal. The difference Is
$47.0iX>.000 in favor of Nicaragua."
'The committee takes position against
holfllng the pending bill until the Walker
Commission can report, saying:
â¢â¢All the commission's field work is done
and the working parties have returned
to the United States, except a party of
hydrographere left there to ascertain the
Tninta.ll and the fluctuations of the
Chagre* River. If this â¢ hydrographic
work Is to be prosecuted hereafter as long
and as thoroughly as it has been hereto
fore It will be a half century before we
can determine the practicability of the
Panama canal so far as it depends"on the
rainfall and the fluctuations of the
Chagres River.
"It is evident that the report to be made
by these hydrographers is not a vital fac
tor In the question of the practicability of
the canal.
"Our engineers have come to no conclu
sion on the point of difficulty and have
relegated the decision of the whole matter
to the French engineers, to be determined
by further experiment. When these en
gineers are in possession of all the facts
that are known and are not able to de
termine the level at which the canal shall
be built. If we wait until they have settled
this vital point we put ourselves at their
mÂ»rcy and can only provide for the
wants of our own Government and people
when they have decided what is the best
for their own interests. Congress owes a
higher duty than this to the American
people."
On the general question of the construc
tion of a canal the committee takes the
position that whatever canal be construct
ed, its ownership must bs American, and
that delay may be fatal to the success of
the enterprise. It is argueu by the com
mittee that delay in construction cannot
possibly advance the settlement of any
question as to the canal after its comple
tion. The committee t therefore announces
its conclusion to be that Coneress should
provide mear.s and authority for con
structing a canal by the Nicaragua route
and leave it to the President to deal with
any questions of a diplomatic sort that
may be raised by other nations in the
progress of the work. After the bill be
comes a law, it is declared, our first duty
is to agree with Nicaragua as to terms,
leaving to the future all dealings with
other powers as to the privileges they
shall enjoy in 'the canal.

LONDON. May 16.â The Chancellor of
the Exchequer, Sir Michael Hicks-Beach,
speaking -at -Bristol', this evening, congrat
ulated the audience on the fact that the
cloud of war was fairly lifting and that
there were streaks of light portending . a

The Chancellor denied that he was per

HARD TIMES AHEAD
IN GREAT BRITAIN
To-day's installment of the war story
from every part of the war field is, there
fore, seemingly a narrative of British
successes, but with the Boers preparing
for a last desperate fling farther in the
interior and with Boer guerrilla parties
looting houses and stores in the north
west section of Cape Colony, it is not all
roses for the British.
The TTpIngton district is the locality
where the guerrilla tactics of the Boers
are just now most in evidence.
The postponed congress of the African
der Bund has been called to meet at
Paarle June 15.
A Canadian battery of 13-pounders ar
rived at Beira, Portuguese East Africa,
May 10.
The Dally Graphic, which refers to the
Boer mission to the United States as a by
product of the war, says; "There is no
name of importance among the orators
who saluted the delegates. We. fear they
have fallen Into a sort of Anglo-Saxon
ambush and are being victimized for
purely party, purposes." "
The Times considers the rumors cabled
here- as to- President McKinley's alleged
pro-Boer sympathies Â¦ "utterly baseless."
It says: "Mr. McKinley is convinced that
the country does not wish him to interfere
and that, interference -would be in air re
spects inexpedient as well as impossible."
The Times also refers to the admission
by" the American State* Department of
Portugal's general right to refuse pas
sage to contraband goods.
The Lourepzo Marquez correspondent of
the Times under Tuesday's date says:
"There has been a heated discussion in
the Raad in secret session respecting the
expediency of destroying the mines. The
result is not publicly known. The for
eign mining representatives, are greatly
alarmed and have addressed strong rep
resentations to their respective Consuls."
Persons acquainted with" Colonel Baden'-
Powell's scheme of defense at Mafeking
assert that' the occupation of the Kaffir
location by the Boers would not endanger
the garrison, provided relief came quickly.
A 1 telegram from Cape Town says that

Guerrilla "Warfare.
LONDON, May 17, 3:20 a. m.â The
British relief column fought the
Boers at Kraal Pan, thirty-two
milts south of .Mafeking, on Tues
day, according to a telegram re
ceived Wednesday at Lourenzo Marques
from Molopo, 100 miles north of Mafeking.
This intelligence Is accepted here with
some reserve", because It Is difficult to
understand^ how the news could have been
so quickly put on the wire from a place
132 miles from the scene of the engage^
ment.
A correspondent of the Morning Post,
presumably John Stuart, is reported cap
tured by the Boers at Kraal Pan.
The British public is kept expectant of
the announcement that Mafeking has
been relieved. In army circles the opinion
seems to prevail that this has already
been accomplished, although two hours
after midnight the War Office asserted
that news of the relief had not been re
ceived. The steadfast courage of the
hunger-bitten garrison has produced a
deep impression, and the news of succor
Is awaited with more anxiety than has
been felt regarding any other event of
the war.
Big News Held Back.
Douglass Storey, the Mail's correspond
ent at Pretoria, wires: "The Boer Gov
ernment is holding back some big news.
Fever prevails here. President Kruger
is working day and night. The latest
Boer official bulletin is that the relief
column has been defeated with great
loss."
Lord Roberts continues passive at
Kroonstad. His cavalry . are stretching
like a semi-circular screen many miles In
length, without lapping flanks. The rail
way will probably be completed to-day.
The Kroonstad censor permits the pas
sage of long dispatches dealing with In
cidents prior to the occupation.
It seems that General French's cavalry
had one lively fight after crossing the
Zand River. A mixed squadron, com
posed of the Scots Greys, the Innlskil
lings. Carbineers and Australian Horse,
took a kopje and dismounted. The Boers
suddenly nred from a concealed position,
killing many horses and stampeding the
rest. The Boers then advanced in* over
whelming numbers and drove the squad
ron, capturing some. The Boers robbed
the dead and looted the saddles. A small
brigade of cavalry drove them off. -
Farther north the Hussars charged the
BoerB, killing and wounding many strag
glers with sabers and pistols. Lord Rob
erts' infantry marched 120 miles in seven
days. General French marched thlrty
rniles in one day. The Boers, when re
tiring, dragged thirty-two guns through
Kroonstad.
General Buller's Move.
General Buller Is moving toward New
castle. He appears to be using 25,000 men
against 5000 or G000. His operations will
almost certainly- result in forcing his way
into the Transvaal, possibly in time to co
operate with Lord Roberts' advance, al
though General Buller is now 252 miles
from Johannesburg, or twenty-five days'
march.
A Dane, who was captured by tho South
African Horse, says that there are 500
Frenchmen with the Boers who are op
posing Buller, together with many Ger
mans and other foreigners.
The Ladysmith correspondent_of the
Dally Telegraph says that. only o"ne "Boer
was shot in the movement which resulted
in the taking of Helpmaaker.

' HAVANA. May 15.â Warrants were is
sued this evening for tne arrest of E. Pi
Thompson, the Havana Postmaster; W".
H. Reeves, deputy officer of the island,
and Edward Moya and Jorge Mascaro,
Cuban clerks In the stamp department,
and by 7 o'clock all were lodged in the
Vlvac, the Tombs of Havana. This wa3
done under the advice of the postal in
spectors who arrived to-day. It laJ consid
ered now that Reeves Is equally guilty
with Neely.
Investigation as to the record of the
clerk in the military department who
handled several hundred dollars" worth
of stamps proves that the transaction, so
far as he is concerned, was legitimate.
The stamps were purchased at the re
quest of his brother, who is a stamp col
lector in the United States, for $S0O. They
were of the old issue and were obtained
from Neely.
The arrest of Thompson caused great
surprise in the city. It is looked upon as
the precursor of many other arrests.
General Wood feit. as did the special in
spectors, that It would be. better to have
the suspected persons arrested and to give
the men opportunity to obtain bail than to
keep them indefinitely under close super
vision at a time when the detectives werÂ«
needed for other work.
HAVANA POSTMASTER
PUT UNDER ARREST
Interrupting Bacon, Hale of Maine as
serted that the order creating Major
Rathbone's office was of a character of
power such as was given to Roman pro-
Consuls. There was nothing like it in this
Government. It was a power unrestrained,
unbridled. After paying a compliment to
Major Kathbcne. Hale continued:
"The Senator and all of U3 ought to have
known that the giving of this unbridled
power to one man would be abused by the
men under him, and In the end he would
suffer."
Hale did not approve of this fashion of
teaching self-government to the Cubans.
Bacon, continuing, said the question now
presented was, should Congress sit still, In
the face of these gross violations of public
trust, or should It investigate them to the
bottom? He understood that the majority
of the Committee on Relations with Cuba
did not desire an investigation of Cuban
affairs by Congress because Senators were
startled at the magnitude of the work
and were afraid it might take the bal
ance of the year. If these Senators were
not willing to undertake the work he
(Bacon) knew cf Senators who were.
Bacon's resolution was made subject to
the call of any Senator, Platt of Con
necticut expressing a desire to address
himself to some of the statements Bacon
had made.
of 'greater dignity than a sreneral com
manding an army in the field? What ob
ligation was there on thi3 Government ta
plnce him In a position -of viceregal au
thority? What obligation was there on
the Government that any one who cla!me(l
to hive an official dignity in Cuba should
be the guest of this man?
Eacon declared that ono of the promi
nent officials in Cuba had used the Cuban
funds with which to purchase personal
apparel. He further asserted that ther*
were well founded rumors that there had
hc?n the most extravagant expenditure 01
Cuban funds for fitting up luxurious quar
ters for officers and furnishir.g these offi
cers horses, carriages and liveried serv
ants.
"Still further." said he. "within the past
week the fact has teen disclosedâ a fact
that brings the blush of shame to thÂ»
cheek c* every American citizenâ that
trusted officials in Cuba have misappro
priated large amounts belonging to the
people of Cuba. Nobody knows how largo
these amounts are. At firÂ«t it was stated
that they were $-10,000. Next it was said
they would amount to $73,000. and now it
Is intimated the amounts may aggregate
$400,000. At first one man only was In
volved in the difficulty. Now there are
manyâ so many that It is intimated it may
â¢amount to a conspiracy.'*
Bacon th*n read the order under which
Major Rathbone was acting a3 Director
of Posts of Cuba and said the power con
ferred upon him by that order was so
great that it had resulted In a disgraceful
and mortifying condition of affairs.
Given Autocratic Power.
Bacon discussed at length the allow
ances made to various officer? in Cuba by
direction of Secretary Alger. He inquired
why such allowances were not made to
General Wilson and General Lee. He read
the order of General Alger making an al
lowance of $7500 per year in addition to his
salary to Governor General Brooke.
What was. there. Bacon inquired, in the
office of the Governor General of Cuba
which required him to exercise functions
The Bacon Cuban investigation resolu
tion was then. called up by its author.
who. in opening, said that there could be
no more mandatory duty than that which
rests upon the United States that every
dollar collected in Cuba should be applied
to the people of Cuba. Every dollar so
collected, he said, belonged to the people
of Cuba, and not a dollar to the United
States or to any official of the United
States.
Obligations of national honor demanded
that we investigate the affairs cf Cuba
and see that they have been rightly con
ducted. Perhaps at no time had any peo
ple constituted themselves the agent for
a trust such as that we had imposed uporv
ourselves in Cuba. In the degree of honor
with which this duty was performed
would the country be adjudged by the
woria.y'jfjthpr.e-we're^no rumors, he said,
of maladministration on' the" Isnmrt of
Cuba, the duty to investigate the busi
ness and governmental affaira of the islÂ«
and would still be upon us.
"But." he declared, "we are urged not
alone by the voice of duty. The facts
urge the investigation to b<* made. There
has been in Cuba the most exorbitant
and extravagant expenditure of money.
If we had before us only the naked fact
that the receipts on the island during the
single year were more than $16,000,000 and
the expenditures more than J14.000.000 we
would be bound to investigate' the sub
ject to see that this vast sum had been
properly and prudently handled."
Continuing. Mr. Bacon presented a
statement shewing the receipts and ex
penditures of the various States, Includ
ing Georgia, Missouri and Massachusetts.
They were in eveiy instance less than
those of Cuba.
Â¦ "These expenditures in Cuba," said Ba
con, "are so much larger in proportion to
these of many States that oven it there
were no rumors of extravagance and
fraud and corruption in connection with
Cuban affairs they would call in trumpet
tones for an investigation. We have had
all sorts of accusations in the press of the
country, and finally there have been ad
missions of irregularities in the financial
affairs of the island."

WASHINGTON. May lG.-DlscussIon of
the administration of affairs in Cuba by

part cf to-day's session. Eacon of Geor
gia addressed the Senate at length on his
resolution directing the Committee on Re
lations with Cuba to make an investiga
tion of the con^vct cf financial affairs
of the island. lie said it was due the
people of this country to know just how
affairs in the island were being conducted,
and since the disclosures of the past few
days had been made v.lth respect to the
alleged misappropriation of funds in the
postal service, the obligation upon Con
gress to make an investigation was doubly
heavy. He urged that the honor of the
country depended upon its being able to
clear away the fraud and corruption
which, it was charged, had been discov
ered. He insisted that the Government of
the United States haÂ» no authority In
Cuba, and demanded to know how soon
it proposed to redeem its pledge and leave
the government of the Island to its in
habitants. t-W* -:

TON HOTEL. WASHINGTON. May 18.â i
William A. Clark of Montana will not be !
permitted to take his seat in the Senate
on the appointment by Lieutenant Gov- 'Â¦
emnr Springs, ever, if his opponents have ;
to resort to filibustering tactics. The best
lawyers of the Senate generally agree
that all cf the law points involved are I
technically in Mr. Clark's favor, but they
argue that there are other points to be '
considered.
The Senate Is. fcy the constitution, judge
cf the Qualifications of its own members, '
and a canvass of the situation to-day
ehows vhat the whoie proceedings con- !
nected with Mr. Clark'* resignation and ;
Fubsequer.t appointment have caused Â¦
many Senators hitherto friendly to him j
to favor exercising their right agrsinst j
him. Measured from a purely Montana |
etanfiard. Mr. Clark's move is regarded j
es shrewd and skillful, but Senators gen- j
erally refer to it as a "trick." hardly in j
keeping with the methods allowed in a |
dignified body like the Senate.
Barred' Prom This Session.
That he will be kept out of the Senate j
during the present session, leaders say. is I
a foregone conclusion. Precedents are t
brir.i; looked up in order that objections ]
may be made to receiving credentials. |
Several cases have bc-cn found where such <
objections have been made on the ground
cf fraud.
The first direct vote probably will come
en a motion to refer the case to the Com
mittee on Privileges and Elections with- (
out swearing in Mr. Cl.irk. The case once i
referred to The committee, it will be there,
of course, until Congress adjourns. I
Many Senators are so much incensed
over the mannc-r in which Mr. Clark
avoided being expelled from the Senate
that they ar* now seriously talking of
passinp a resolution declaring that he was
rot legally elected by the Legislature, re
pardleÂ«=s of his resignation. Although
Mr. Clark's name was Ftricken from the
roll? the day his resignation was present
ed. Fenator Chandler and other members
of the committee believe that the Senate
can properly act upon the resolution. By
inking s=uch action. It Is argued, the Sen
ate will simply clear up the record as to
Mr. Clark's temporary service in the Sen
ate and at the same time make the Clark
case analogous to the Quay case.
Senator Clark Sanguine.
Mr. Clark is frank in expressing his
gratification at the appointment and In
stating his belief that the Senate will re
ceive him on these credentials.
"All precedents are that there should be
no legislation on the committee resolution
pending- at the time of my resignation. I
do not think that Senators will find occa
sion to go out of their way to make an
exception in my case." said he. "It is
highly probable that Mr. Daly and his
men are displeased over this result, and
knowing; them as I do, I am not surprised
at anything they will insinuate or
charge."
President pro tern. Frye to-day laid be- j
fore the Senate the Montana resolution, j
Chandler asked that the resolution bÂ» j
postponed until Jl o'clock on Saturday In j
order to give the Senate Committee on
Privileges and Elections time to consider j
whether any further action was neces
sary. This was agreed to.

WASHINGTON. May lS.-ThÂ«Â» officials
of the War Department, after waiting for
nearly a week to hear something from
General MacArthur at Manila confirma
tory of the press report of the bloody
three days' engagement at Catubig. which
resulted in the heaviest loss of life the
American army has sustained in any one
engagement in the Philippines, yesterday
cabled MacArthur a request for informal,
tion. The answer was received to-day
confirming the press reports and adding
some interesting details. .--â '-.
General MacArthur transmitted a report
from Henry T. Allen, a major. of the
Forty-third volunteers, who commanded
the United States force3 on the island of
Samar. It appears that this force was
divided in several ports in Samar, and.
while details are still lacking, it is be
lieved that this particular force, which
was besieged at Catubig, was commanded
not by a commissioned officer but by a
sergeant, either George or Hall, both of
whom were killed. Catubig. where the en
gagement occurred, is a seaport town of
nearly 10.000 inhabitants.
General MacArthur's cablegram is as
follows:
M\NILA, May IS.â With reference to your
telegram of the 14th the rumored engagement
in Samar reported tn the cablegram of General
Otl3 on May 4 has been confirmed by reports !
recently from Henry T. Allen, Forty-third
Regiment. U. S. V. Infantry, .commanding on
Samar Island. The detachment of thirty-one
men stationed Â«t Catublg was attacked on
April 15 by 600 men with 100 rifles and one
cannon. Our men were quartered in a con
vent, which was nred the next day by burn
ing hemp thrown from the adjoining church.
The detachment tried to escape, by the river,
but the men getting Into the. boat were killed
and the remaining men entrenched themnelves
near the river and held out two days longer,
facing most adverse circumstances, until res
cued by Lieutenant Sweeney and ten men.
Over 200 of the attacking party, many of whom
are reported to have come from Luzon Island,
are reported killed and many wounded. Lieu

Admiral Admits That the Presiden

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. May 17.-A dispatch to the
Journal from Washington says: Admiral
Dewey returned from his Western trip
to-day, and while he will not talk politics
It is understood by his friends that the
Presidential nomination is admitted by
him to be beyond his reach. The admiral
Is highly elated by the popular ovation
that met him at every step.. is convinced
that he has the love of his countrymen
everywhere in this broad land, is satisfied
with this and is indifferent as to the fu
ture.
The statement of political .principles
that it was believed in some quarters
Â¦would be lorthcominfg on tho admiral's
return . has not been prepared. It prob
ably never will.

booth of the reception committee. The
headquarters of thÂ«> 1900 rommittoe is in
the first gallery on th*> east side of the
pavilion. The plac* is a scene of erreat
activity, as the final details of the man-
agement of the great meeting are con-
sidered. South of this room is what is
called "the rest room." It has been taste
fully fitu-d up with rug5. lounges, settees
I chairs and tables. Stationery will be pro
vided for the accommodation of those who
wish to write letters, and it will be a
pleasant place in which friends may meet
and those who may be wearied of attend
ing the convention may take a quiet rest.
It is stated by the friends of J. W. Ross,
president of the 1300 committee, that he
can have the presidency of the Christian
Endeavor if he wants it. By the consti
tution it must fall to a layman and to a
member of the Christian Church En
deavor, in denominational succession.
State Treasurer Warren of Santa Bar
bara is the logical candidate, but it !s
understood that he does not want It. al
though he may come in the convention.
J. W. Baker of San Jose Is a new.- man
mentioned.
Chairman Ross, in relation to his candi
dacy, said:
"I am not a candidate of my own ac
cord, although my name Is mentioned.
The prime, reason is that I cannot find
time to attend. to the office. You may say
that 1 cannot see my way clear to-day to
accept the office were it tendered to mo,
which I do not know will be the case."
One of Mr. Ross" suporters said, how
ever, that he could easily get it and that
he would no doubt be tendered the honor.
Whether there will bo any changes in
the constitution of the organization at tho
convention is not known. It is possible
that the constitution mav be amended so
that the president will be paid a salary
and be required to devote his entire time
to the wcrk.
To-morow's convention will be. the first
held und^r the rule that' all members of
the societies nre delegates. In regard to
the ofllcers under the president there is
nothing certain. There Is no "polities'
bring done and the geographical condi
tions usually settle the selection of ofllcers

The Republican State Convention of
Missouri to-day, in a continuous session,
lasting from 9:45 a. m. to 4:45 p. m., named
the delegates at large, alternates at large
and Presidential electors to Philadelphia
and selected a full set of State officers.
The nominations for Governor and Lieu
tenant Governor were by acclamation and
there were but slight contests for J.he
other State officers.
The big tight of the convention was ex
pected to come over the, selection of dele
gates at large, for which there had orig
inally been seven avowed candidates.
However, hut five names were presentedâ
those of Houser and Dyer of St. Louis,
Mlnnls of Carrollton. Burton of Nevada
and Nathan Frank of St. I^ouis.
The name of Major John L. Blttlnger of
St. Joseph, Consul to Montreal, who was
yesterday considered a strong candidate,
was not presented. Major Bittinger. like
Major William Warner, United States
District Attorney, of Kansas City, who
yesterday withdrew his name to prevent
impending strife, was sacrificed to a sen
timent that Federal office holders should
not attend the National Convention. The
vote resulted: llouser 994, Burton 94.1,
Minnhs 903. Dyer 616Â»A. Frank 610V>, and the
first named four were declared elected.
Nathan Frank, who was the only man
for whom National Committeeman Rich
ard Kerens took a firm stand, and who
was in addition demanded by the Zelgen
hein machine of St. Louis, was deserted
at the last moment in order to make a
place for Dyer. Thus for the first time In
twenty years the Republicans of Missouri
broke away from "bosses." This fact
was emphasized by the delegates when
Dyer's selection was made known by the
most enthusiastic demonstration of the
convention. Delegates waved their hats
and stamped their feet and shouted for
Dyer in a manner that stopped proceed
ings for several minutes.
Nathan Frank was nominated for elec
tor at large, but requested that his name
he withdrawn. The convention voted to
name negroes for alternates at large and
the quartet was selected by acclamation.
The resolutions indorse Mr. Kerens for
re-election as National Committeeman.
Webster Davis, who was expected to be
a factor in the convention and who was
yesterday made the occasion of an hour's
wrangle, took no part in to-day's pro
ceedings aside from that of a spectator.

TOPEKA, Kans., May 16.â The Repub

inated candidates and delegates with un
expected unanimity. The only balloting

war in the party was not involved in the
vote on electors, but the followers of

TO KEEP POPULISTS TN LINE.
Why Towne Was Nominated for the
Vice Presidency.
" "WASHINffrON, May 16.â Senator But
ler, chairman of the National Committee
of the People's-party, was asked to-day
if it were true, as has been reported, that
both Mr. Bryan and Mr. Towne had ex
pressed a preference that the People's
party national convention should not
nominate a .Vice Presidential candidate.
He replied:
"I have been told that it is true, but it
was the judgment of the convention that
the best way to Â¦ elect both of them was
to nominate. It must be remembered that
neither Mr. Bryan nor Mr. Towne is in
timately acquainted with the present sit
uation as to the Populist vote of the coun
try. Mr. Bryan could not be elected by
disbanding or appearing to disband the
organization . of . the People's party. To
have done so would have lost him ten
Populist votes for every gold Democratic
vote that he would have won back to
him. Iri short, the conventiou*-did the
thing that was necessary to be done to
insure the election of Mr. Bryan."

MISS JULIA MARLOWE.
In a recent letter to The Peruna Medi-
cine Co., Miss Julia , Marlowe of New
York City has the following to say of
Peruna:
"/ am glad to write my endorse-
ment of the great remedy, Peruna,
as a nerve ionic. I do so most
heartily." Julia Marlowe.
Nervousness Is very common among
women. This condition is due to anemic
nerve centers. The nerve centers are the
reservoirs of nervous vitality. These cen-
ters become bloodless for want of proper
nutrition. This is especially true In the
spring season. Every spring a host of in-
valids are produced as the direct result
of weak nerves.
This could be easily obviated by the us<Â»
of Peruna. Peruna strikes at the root of
the difficulty by correcting the digestion.
Digestion furnishes nutrition for the nems
centers. Properly digested food furnishes
these reservoirs of life with vitality,
which leads to strong, steady nerves, and
thus nourishes life.
Peruna is in great favor a^non? women,
especially those who have vocations that
are trying to the nervous system. Peruna
furnishes the lasting Invigoration for thtÂ»
nerve3 that such people so much need.
Thousands of testimonials from women
in all parts of the United States are beln*
received every year. Such unsolicited evU
dence surely proves that Peruna is with-
out an equal as a nerve tonic and vital
Invigorator.
Buy a bottle of Peruna to-day. Jt
you do not receive all the bene-
fits from Peruna that you expected,
write to Dr. Hartman, Columbus,
Ohio.

CHICAGO, May 13.â Three persons were
killed, one Is missing and thirteen vrtre
Injured as a result of the fire which early
to-day destroyed the Hotel Helene at 110
114 Fifty-third street. Five of. the injured
will probably die. The dead:
CHARLOTTE PETERSON, dining room
girl, found In her room burned to a crisp.
LENA (surname unknown to police),
found burned almost beyond- recognition
In the room with Miss Peterson,
S. G.'McHADDBN.
Seriously injured: W. E. Horn terribly
burned, leg broken; will die.
E. E. Tarvis, burned; recovery doubtful.
Elizabeth Florence, internally Injured
and skull fractured; unconscious: recov
ery doubtful. â¢ .
E. B. Allen, internally injured In Jump
ing from thitd-story windotrT
Mrs. T. D. Allen, back, broken and In
ternally injured; Jumped from third-story
window; will die. .
Miss Helen Joseph, badly bruised and
overcome by srrtoke.
Stella Neiiwolskl, chambermaid, jumped
from Hrst floor: overcome by smoke and
injured internally.
L. J. McNeil porter, burned about fac*.
Miss Sarah Hutchinson, . a hlrh school
teacher; injured in falling from Â»e<Sond
floor.
James Costin, fireman, cut by falling
glaes. â¢
. Mrs. Bruce, overcome by smoke,
Thomas Morgan, policeman, back in
jured.
Mrs. Adella Lawson, badly bruised.
The loss to the building and furnishings
was $40,000. James McNeil, the hotel por
ter, was the first to warn the sleeping oo
cupants of their danger. He carried Helen
Joseph down a swaying ladder from the
third floor and then, amid the cheers of
the onlookers, returned to the second floor,
where a woman was lying unconscious,
with her clothing on fire. He carried her
to the window and dropped her Into the
arms of Policeman Wolf. Then McNeil
himself staggered back into the smoke. A
policeman mounted to the shoulders of a
Brother officer and, clambering over the
window ledge, caught McNeil by the feet
and dragged him from the room. He soon
recovered consciousness.
Mrs. Bruce, with one arm around her
Infant child, was clinging with the other
arm to the ledge of a second story win
dow. Smoke was pouring out in smother
ing clouds. Three policemen, carrying a
blanket, rushed into the flames which
were darting from the basement windows
just in time to- catch the woman and her
child, when they dropped. Mrs. Bruce waa
badly burned, but had succeeded in pro
tecting her baby, so that not one hair of
its head had been injured.
The rescues were nearly all accom
plished before the firemen arrived.
The fire started in the basement and
spread with great rapidity. But for the
heroic action of Porter McNeil every per
son in the building would undoubtedly
have perished. There was only one en
trance to the building, and the greater
number of the guests had to escape aa
beat they could through the windows.

VAST HORDES
ARE DEPENDENT
UPON CHARITY
LONDON. May 16.â Dealing with the
famine In the central provinces of India,
which have an area equal to that of
Austria 'and a population of nearly 11,
000,000, and which were formerly most
prosperous, the Daily Chronicle's corre
spondent at Bllaspur writes:
"The demand for Government assist
ance is unparalleled. In one district 40
per cent are dependent on the Siekar for
their daily bread; in two Others the per
centage Is over SO. In the whole area
there are 1,500,000 people with no other
sources of subsistence than Government
charity.
. "In the eastern division, where the crop
failure was the most complete, we have
had the best of opportunity of seeing the
gigantic organization evolved for grapling
with the famine. The abomination of des
olation is here. Not a toiler Is seen In
the fields. When the last rain failed and
the rude peasantry saw the young rice
shoots blasted by the fierce August sun,
they were left without resources and the
few silver ornaments which every Indian
family possesses went at last. Then they
crowded the relief works by hundreds of
thousands."
NEW YORK, May 16.â Certain newspa
pers having made the statement that Lord
Curzon, Viceroy of India, had said that
no further help 'was needed In the famine,
the New York committee of one hundred
on India famine relief sent the following
cablegram to Lord Curzon:
Committee of 100 citizens, formed hers fcr

more funds needed. Cable full facts at our ex
pense.
The reply received Is as follows:

comes from being afflicted with
Â¦ a fried truffle appetite with a fried
[ bacon purse," said Frank Baker, as
4,-? he 6at In the California-street police
station yesterday morning. After loosen
ing the band of his trousers to permit his
alimentary* canal to get all the good possi
ble out of a $2 23 meal that had landed him
In Jail he continued: "My appetite Is not
congenital. It is the result of luxurious*
environment in days some time past nnd
starvation days Just over. I am equare,
however, squarer than the meal that has
given me both pleasure and pain, and In
the name of Its memory I swear to pay
the 60 due."
Baker, formerly a general utility man at
tho Pacific Union Club, swung Into
Swain's bakery on Sutter street yester
day morning for a "bite." With an ele
gance born of long association with gen
tlemen of the clubs he gave his "order.
Mush and cream, bacon and eggs, tender
loin steak, lamb chops (frenched), straw
berries and cream, cheese from Switzer
land, Â« dates from Persia, figs from
Smyrna, a bottle bearing a war stamp,
and a cigar, fragrant and fat and tagged
at 50 cents, composed his "bite." Picking
up his check he advanced to the counier
and extended $1 65 to the proprietor in his
open palm. The bill called for $2 25. A
brief controversy was closed with the
warbling of a police whistle and Baker
was led away to Jail. "Can't get away
with a batch of stuff, like that every day, 1 '
he said. "Circumstances will not permit.
I have been at the County Hospital for
four days. The first morning when- 1 was
driven from . the officers' table to which
I had aimlessly wandered in to the pa
tients' dining room my apetite fled. Since
then my dreams have been of the old
club days when the bread was baked and
the cold tea was not used for lye to clean
the kitchen tin." As Baker finished his
musing the proprietor of the restaurant
entered the station and dismissed the
case.
"I don't owe you so much," said Baker
In farewell. "You have my tl 65. but aa
your charge was not unreasonable I will
labor to repay you, but you must wait
until my hands are turned to some re
munerative pursuit."

and other quasi public corporations" no deduc
tion from the vaiue of thÂ«. property la allowed
on account of the indebtedness; the whole of
the property â precisely commensurate with the
interest* cf both debtor and creditorâ Is aa
sessed to such corporation; and thus as an
Interest in the affected property (which Is de
clared to be for this purpose by thÂ« first
claupo of section 4) the second obligation Is
asÂ«erÂ«ed and the tax Is paid by the debtor
corporation.
It necersarily follows that to assess and tax
the obligation' apaln to the holder thereof, as
if It were an unsecured credit, would be to
tax tha Fame property twice, which In this in
stance at least is made impossible by the
tertris of the constitution; for since the ee
cured obligation is for the purposes of assess
ment and taxation to be deemed and treated
as an lntereft In the property affected It cannot
be taxed except as euch Interest.
Attention Is called to the cases where
various securities are scattered all over
thÂ» world where It would be Impos
sible to tax them. Unless the property
Itself be taxed the State would derive no
revenue from it. Judgment of the lower
court was reversed.
Justice Garoutte adds that a contrary
Judgment to that Just given would
deprive all residents of the State of the
opportunity of buying bonds of the char
acter involved and these securities would
be bought and held in the great money
centers of Europe.
Justice Van Dyke In a dissenting- opin
ion says:
It goes without Baying that the more subjects
exempted from taxation the greater must be
the rate of taxation as to those taxable. Where,
therefore, a vast amount of capital Invested In
notes, bonds and other securities Is exempted
from or esrapes taxation the more onerous be
comes the burden of taxation to those who ara
not so fortunate as to be creditors but who
may own other epecles of property. The ex
tent to which the exemption of various forms
of credits had been carried under the decisions
of the court, aa already stated, had become a
crying evil, and It was the fixed purpose of the
people cf this State, as declared In the pres
ent constitution, to reach and tax every epe
cles of credits, whether secured or unsecured.
â¢ * * History teaches that the tendency is
and always has been for the more favored u
shift the burden of governmental support from
their own ehoulders to thÂ« shoulders of those
less favored and less able to bear such burden.
â¢ â¢ â¢ Nothliy; Is more calculated to produce
dlsaatUf&ctlon and unrest, and Justly bo. than
lawB the "operation of which lavor or even
teem to favor the few or a class as against the
great body of the people. It should require
thÂ« most direct and Imperative command of
the constitution to Justify a decision of this
court teadlcs to euch results; and none such
exist here.
The Supreme Court also handed down
a decision in the matter of the
assessment of taxes on certain personal
property of the estate of â¢ the late James
O. Fair. The City and County Assessor
filed a petition in the Superior Court pray
ing for an order directing the executors
of the Â©state to pay taxes on personalty
assessed amounting to J&S.S12. The ex
ecutors made answer that they had ten
dered the taxes on the estate liable to
taxation here, but that the residue of the
property assessed consisted of bonds of
various corporations secured by mort
gages and not subject to taxation here.
The first class consists of bonds of the
South Facitic Coast Railway Company
and of the Northern Railway Company of
California, each corporation being organ
ized under the laws of this State. The
Supreme Court decided that the assess
ment on these bonds was void, the point
at Issue having been disposed of In the
Oermania Trust case.
The other bonds assessed were of the
Pacific Rolling MlIls a Company, valued at
$73,000. The Supremt? Court holds the as
sessment of the Kalr estate for these
bonds was void, as they must be assessed
as asi interest in the property lncumbered
for their payment.
The other bonds considered were those
of railroad corporations organized under
the laws of West Virginia and operated
elsewhere than in California and assessed
for S713.000. These bonds have never been
here, being kept in New York. The conten
tion was that no assessment could be
made on this class of bonds. On this mat
ter the Supreme Court says:
"The court below was right in holding
that the answer of the executors showed
no defense to the demand for taxes on the
bonds of the foreign railroad corporations,
but since it appeared from the answer
that the taxes on the other bonds were
not authorised by law, it was error to
sustain the demurrer to the answer as a
whole."
The order appealed from was reversed.
The Supreme Court also passed upon
the case of the estate of Henry Pichoir,
deceased. The Assessor sued the estate
for taxes. The executor resisted upon the
ground that much of the estate was in
bonds of quasi public corporations and,
therefore, not subject to taxation. The
Supreme Court's decision Is identical with
that rendered in the Germania Trust
Company case.

CHICAGO, May 18.â The friend* of Pres

adoption of the leading paragraphs in the
report which criticize the President and

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MAY 17,. 1900.
<=-Â¦Â¦ iHE firemen of engines 3 and 15 were tho victims of a practical Joke sup
posed to have been perpetrated by fair maidens of the Hamlin School, at
the corner of Gough and Jackson streets, yesterday afternoon. They
responded to a telephone call informing them that the institution was In
flames, but when they arrived on the scene, all thoughts of heroic rescues
and daring deeds were quickly dissipated by the ringing out of a jolly "Ha
ha!" Who sent the mysterious message is yet conjecture, but the fire laddies
vrent home convinced that they saw guilt In some of the smiling grlrlish faces
and that a secret will be spoken In whispers for eome time to come within
the walls of the Hamlin schoolhouse. . . ;- Â¦Â¦-.":Â¦- ,'Â¦
About 3 o'clock tho engine companies received a telephone call. As they
dashed down the street the firemen saw girls on " the fire-escapes and in the
windows, .with looks of terror on their faces. Everything Indicated that a .
terrible hblocaust was Imminent. Some dashed Into the building, while"
others. connected tho engines with fire-plugs, and stretched : lines . of hose.
Captains Whittaker and Russell led the men up the stairsto fÂ»Â»rht'the blaze.
Hardly had the firemen entered the building before the' faces on which
had been written fear took , on broad grins and " the forms dropped back
from the windows and congregated In the halls, v where the , "ha-ha" was - ;
handed out In large = packages. Every one In the place professed: absolute lg-
norance as to the mysterious message, but Captain Russell says that a pretty
.name passed - around in" an undertone and that he has a clew, to work on.
Last night the affair was explained at the: schools by, saying, that, some- '
body had eeen smoke arising from the roof and that the fire companies iwere
summoned. The captains state that no such explanation was made to them.'
PRETTY GIRLS GIVE
FIREMEN THE LAUGH
ACCORDING to a decision rendered I
yesterday by thÂ« Supreme Court
bonds of rallroatls and other quasi J
public con?orarions cannot be as-
EcsFPd for the purpose of taxation. By
this decision the city Is deprived of taxes
on bonds amounting to over $20.CÂ»X).000 and
the State of taxes on securities running
into several bssdred millions. " The deci
sion was rendered In the case of the Ger
manla Trust Company against the city
and county of San Francisco. It was
written by Commissioner Brltt shortly
before his retirement from the Supreme
Court ard concurred !n by Justices Mc-
Farlar.d. Temple, Garoutte and Harrison
and Commissioners Chipman and Cooper.
Justice Van Dyke dissented.
The case crigir.ated really In the State
Boaxd cf Equalisation in 1S93. The board
eer.t f> Attorney General Tirey L% Ford
for his opinion as to the legality of as
sessing the bonds of railroads and other
(jua.Â«i public corporations. Ford cited the
general law as expounded by nearly every
BupreGM Court In the United States, as
well as the text writers, to the effect that
all suc!i securities were taxable. Cali
fornia Tras the exception, a decision to
the contrary having been rendered thirty
years ago.
Upon this the Board of Equalization di
rected Assessor Dodge of San Francisco
to proceed on the lines of thÂ« opinion
given bv the Attorney General.
The Gerrr.anla Trust Company of this
city held bonds of the North Pacific Rail
way Company, a corporation owned and
operated wholly in this State. The taxes
on these bonds were paid under protest
by thf trust company, which then began
suit fcr the recovery of the money on
The ground that the aÂ«>e>sment was In
valid. In the Superior Court the Assessor
In'lrs decision the Supreme Court says
the question fer decision was whether
euch bonds are assessable for the pur

The court quotes the constitution on the

Wong 8aai I>ee. a Chinese laundryman
appeared before Judge Fritz yesterday on
a charge of disturbing the peace. The
complaining: witness was F. W. Goetze.
2729 Twenty-Plxth street, who alleged that
the noise made by Uie launuryman and
his assistants during the night kept him
and his family awake. About thirty other
resid. :its were la court to give their tes
timony.
The Judjre decided to visit the laundry
and determine for himself whether the
complaint was well founded.

Wednesday at Oakland track in conjunc
tion with the seventh annual celebration
of the Butchers' Board of Trade will close

Sullivan Opposed to Ingieslde.
Chief of Police Sullivan refuses to say
what he Intends to do If the Â¦ Ingleside
coursing people lnslsj on carrying out
their programme for to-day.
"I do not care to discuss the matter,"
he remarked last night. "If I were to
divulge my plans they would try to cir
cumvent me and for that reason I don't
wish to discuss dog racing at Ingleside."
Notwithstanding the Chief's reticence It
is known that he has Instructed Captain
Gillln to prevent any attempt or the
coursing men to race their doga at tho
Ingleside track.
Serious charged have been preferred
against Policeman Dan Owens of the
North End Station. He is accused of ap
propriating a helmet belonging to a fel
low officer named Stanton, better known
as "Castle Garden." Several days ago
Stanton bought a new helmet which was
the envy of the other officers of his divis
ion. Owens cast many longing glances at
the piece of headgear and finally resolved
to get possession of It, even at the risk
of losing his star. He waited until Stan
ton placed the helmet in his locker and
watching his chance opened the door and
captured the prize "bonnet." .
Hastily transferring the numbers of his
old helmet to the new. one he left the
station.
When Stanton returned to the station
the following day he was surprised to
find his new helmet gone and an old one
substituted. It was identified as belong
ing to the enterprising Owens and he was
sent for.
Owens appeared at the station a short
time afterward, his head decorated with
Stanton's helmet. When confronted with
the evidence of his guilt he confessed that
he had taken the helmet, but claimed it
was done as a "josh." Chief Sullivan
was at once notified and he concluded to
prefer charges against Owens. He will
have a chance to explain matters at the
next meeting of the Board of Police Com
missioners.

Judge P. J. Rellly's Imported greyhound
Ploughboy won the deciding course In the
midweek stake at Union Coursing Park
yesterday from Aeneid kennels' Agamem
non after one of the sensational courses
of the year. The hare was a flyer, taking
the two fast dogs nearly across the field
before Agamemnon secured the first turn.
He ran up a score of eight points to ono,
when the hare turned back from the es
capes and headed for the point where he
had been given his liberty. Ploughboy's
superior condition began to tell at this
point and he took possession. The dogs
ran one minute and nfty-el&ht seconds be
fore they killed Just by the slipper's stand,
the 6core then being 17 to 12 in favor of
Ploughboy. Agamemnon ruled favorite at
odds of 2 to 1 in the betting.
In the seml-linaJs he met Thornhlll, the
stake favorite. Thornhlll did not try,
Agamemnon showing all the speed.
Three favorites, all at odds of 4 to 1,
were bowled over in succession In the
second round. Mira Monte beat O. K.
Capitol, Maid of Ball beat Los Angeles
and Jennie Wilson beat Reannex. Je-nnib
Wilson also beat Slim 2 to 1, Ploughboy

1 PRESCRIPT MO NJ
Mrs. M. F. Long, of I<e Loup,
Franklin Co., Kans., writes: "Words
cannot express how grateful I am for
your kind advice and good medi-
cines. I have been in poor health
more or less all my life.' In the past
nine years grew worse, and two years
ago I was so poorly could hardly drag
around. I consulted a specialist, and
he said I had ulceration and that an
operation would have , u to be per-
formed. This did not seem necessary
to me, so time went by, and at last
/ wrote to Dr. Pierce asking adzrice.
I soon got a helpful answer advising
me to try his medicines, the ' Favor-
ite Prescription,' 'Golaen Medical
Discovery,' and also his 'Pleasant
Pellets.' I began taking 'Favorite
Prescription' and the other med-
icines as advised. When pommenc-
ing I weighed 119^ pounds, and af-
ter taking one bottle of each I felt
like a new woman. In one month I
gained 8 pounds; After taking two
bottles of each of the pedicines,
I began to look like a woman and not
like a skeleton, and that weary tired
feeling all left me."

Another protest was filed j-esterday with
the Board of Supervisors by D. Roth of
201 California street against the recom
mendation of the Judiciary Committee
limiting the height of fences for adver
tising purposes to twenty feet. Mr. Roth
saye he has for vears been a victim of
these fences and has suffered much from
depreciation cf property values because
of them. He continues:
These fences are certainly an unsightly dis
grace. They seriously mar the beauty of our
city fl-nd make It a laughing-stock for visitors.
It SÂ» â¢â¢ shame that owners vrho will cot Im
prove their projjerty thould be allowed for a
mere r>ittance which they receive from adver
tisers to continue this outrage, and It Is a
great Injustice when they are eermitted to do
bo to the injury of adjacent improved residence
property.
Phculd any cf the members of your honorable
body wish to verify this I would deem It a favor
If they would visit the corner cf Hayes and
Baker rtreets. There not only are these etruc
turf-s a detriment to improved property but
they are an eyesore to any observing person,
for they not only hide from, view but also
ruin the approach to the main entrance of
Golden Oate Park, which should be the pride
cf Fan Francisco.
I knew that In European and la some East
ern cities these advertising fences are not tol
erated at all. and If they raurt be allowed here
they certainly should be limited to a height, of
ten feet.

During the trial of the Varney case to
day the report of the expert, who was
commissioned to examine the books of the
Bank of Llvermore after the death of
Cashier Pitcher, was presented in evi
dence. The principal Item of interest in
the report was a statement that doubtful
loans aggregating about $20,000 had been
made as the result of the bank being com
pelled to bid in property on foreclosure
proceedings.
Charles K. Stuart, the accountant cm
ployed to expert the books, testified that
he found the value of the real property of
the bank, taken for debt, to be Jll',000 less
than the ledger account.
"If the bank were a-sked to pay Its de
positors and the amount it owes the Var
ney estate," asked Attorney Treat, "how
much would remain V"
"About S72.7C&," answered Stuart.
"If you should deduct that amount from
the $11)0,000 capital stock, how much would
"Something more than $27,000."
"Is that the depreciation of the value of
the capital stock?"
"It is."
"Besides that, are there not some unse
cured notes which you counted as good?"
"There are."
Attorney Moore here Interjected a re
mark that the greatest fallacy on earth 13
the belief that figures won't lie. In his
opinion anything could be proved by fig
ures.
Attorney "Wheeler stated that the inten
tion was to show the loss to the bank re
sulting from taking unsecured notes and
real property not worth the money loaned
on It. This shrinkage, he said, already ap
pears to amount to more than 133,000.
Assistant Cashier F. Mathieson testified
that the bank had lost $1500 on a note
given by the late G. Valensln and that it
now held an unsecured note of A. T.
Hatch for $1000. Pitcher himself, accord
ing to the witness, had frequently drawn
on the bank for money against his salary
account, but at his death was really in
debted to H for only $20.
The case was continued until to-morrow
morning at 9:30 o'clock.

ARMY INTELLIGENCE.
*'-i| -iHE charge of assault to murder
! against Mrs. Grace Addlson Vroom,
H the actress, for shooting her actor
husband, Frederic Vroom, on May 7,
because of his alleged Infidelity, was dis
missed by Judge Cabanlss yesterday
morning. Mrs. Vroom sat on a chair to
the left of the judicial bench with a
heavy veil covering her face. She eager
ly listened to the testimony of the wit
nesses, and when the Judge dismissed the
case she shook him warmly by the hand
and thanked him.
Detective Dillon testified that no one
could be found to swear to a complaint.
He had procured live witnesses, but ncre
saw the actual shooting.
W. H. Orr, Vroom'e mining partner, tes
tified that he saw Mr. and Mrs. Vroom
immediately after the shooting. She was
in a very excited condition and seemed
to be out of her mind. Vroom whispered
to him: "Tell my wife that 1 slept here
last night If I should die." Orr looked at
him in disgust.
Mrs. Vroom said she had shot him be
cause he had beaten her. He had struck
her on the face and breast. Vroom was
more concerned about himself than his
wife and paid no attention to her. Pre
vious to the day of the shooting she had
asked him as to whether her husband al
ways slept at 10 Annie street, and he
begged her not to get him mixed up In
their private affairs. Vroom had wanted
him on previous occasions to prevaricate
in his favor to Mrs. Vroom, but he re
fused. Vroom had gone to Seattle.
Dr. Charles J. Schmelz, 71 Third street,
testified that Vroom came to his office
on the afternoon of May 7. Ho said he
had received an accidental gunshot wound
In the back. It was a small wound and
when Vroom took off his shirt the bullet
dropped on the floor.
The Judpe said he did not think It was
necessary to call any more witnesses and
as no complaint had been sworn to he
Â¦would dismiss the case.
ROBBED OF HER
DIAMONDS BY A
CHINESE THIEF
Joe Vet. a Chinese servant In the house
of Mrs. Nellie Phinney, widow of the late
cujr Phiriney, a Seattle capitalist
and promoter of street railways. 956 Van
Ness avenue, was arrested at an early
hour yesterday morning by Policeman J.
EL Crowley end locked up In the tanks.
Several charges of grand larcency will be
bcoked against him.
About a month ago Car>tain Seymour
Â¦was notified by Mrs. Phinney that a val
uable diamond ring had been stolen from
a buckskin bag In which she kept her
Jewelry. Detective Dillon was detailed on
the case, and from his report the captain
suspected that some one In the house was
the thief. A few days later Mrs. Phlnney
repcrted that two more diamond rings had
***Â£â¢ stolen, the three being valued at
*2wO. Dillon went again to the house and
his suspicions fell upon the Chinese ser
vant. He asked permission to question
him. but It was refused. Mrs. Phinney be
ing Indignant that any suspicion should
fall upon Joe Yet. Since then two bicy
cles, several valuable dresses, monev and
other valuables have been stolen.
Captain Seymour determined to have
the house watched and Crowley was de
tailed on that duty. About 3 o'clock ves
terday morning Crowley observed a light
In the room occupied by the Chinese and
saw him preparing to leave the house.
He waited till he came out and pounced
upon him. When searched at the City
Prison a number of pawn tickets from a
shop In Chinatown were found In his
pockets and among them were the tick
ets for the three diamond rings, which
were recovered yesterday. It is expected
that all the stolen articles will be recov
ered.
When Mrs. PhJnney was apprised of the
fact she recollected that the Chinese had
bc-en buj-lng gold watches and other jew
elry, and when asked about them he said
he had erot them cheap. For the past few
days he had been acting ug-lv and was
evidently trying to get up a row as an
excuse for leaving, and the police think
that he had decided upon flight when
Crowley caught him.

of Pre.=ident is not a difficult one to fill. All he has to do Is to carry out the
wishes of Congress in accordance with the constitution."
No one can accuse Mr. McKinley of ever having done anything else. He has
done it faithfully, and the country has prospered in consequence. Why, then,
should the people change a President who has proved that he can and that hÂ©
does carry out the wishes of Congress In accordance with the constitution tor an

HE subjection of woman to man in the lotis past has not
Tonly hindered her development in normal ways but has
created a contemptuous opinion of her which runs
through the literature and legislation of all nations, it is
apparent to-day in the different codes of morals for men
: and women, different penalties for crime and in the dis
similar relations of the sexes to the Government, in
marriage woman is not legally her husband's equal, for he has
control of her person and in most instances of her earnings ana
of her minor children. She is rarely paid the same wages as
man, even when she does the same work and does It as well,
and she is the legal equal of man only where punishment and
the payment of taxes are concerned. All these unjust inequal
itips are survivals of i.'.e ases of servitude through which
women have passed, among all peoples of the earth, from the
date of their historic existence.
We boast of our advanced civilization in America and point
with laudable pride to our schools as its foundation. They are
the corner stone of our free institutions, the everlasting granite
on which our Government rests. For here are given the early
trainins and discipline that tell through life and which are vital
to the integrity of the republic. A Bureau of Education has
been established by our national Government which carefully
collects and critically sifts all data pertaining to public school
instruction. Its hiph purpose is to place education on a scien
tific basts and to include all' the children of the State in- Its
beneficent provisions. The overwhelming majority of the
teachers in the schools are women, cultivated, conscientious,
hard-working, patient and unselfish. The high and normal
schools are called Into requisition to fit them for their voca
tion, and the college and university train them In the special
ties they are expected to teach. After years of costly prepara
tion at home and abroad they are assigned to their various
positions and begin their lifework.
They are the equals of the clergy of the land In the correct
ness or their lives, their aims and Intelligence, and co-operate
with them to bring in a nobler civilization. They stand on
tvery round of tha ladder of learning, lifting the children and
youth of their charge to a development of whose existence
many of the parents are unaware. They surround them with
an ethical environment in the schoolroom. There they breathe
a'moral atmosphere. Tbere they must be punctual, obedient,
courteous, careful of school property, industrious, truthful, re-
Fpectful. tidy in person-ln short, they are put in Immedlata
training for the development of qualities without which they
cannot become good members of society.
How do we compensate these faithful women teachers for
their great work In behalf of the generations to come. The
dusty years stretch far behind them, youth and comeliness
drop away from them, and they grow worn and faded before
their time. How do we pay them for the divine service they
render our children while they are on duty? We pay them a3
we pay the small bookkeeper, the stenographer ajid the type
writer. Outside our large cities w*fc pay them as we pay tnÂ«
chambermaid, the laundress, the housemaid. They are as
thoroughly educated as the men with whom they are associ
ated, they do the same work and do it as well, and they bear
as heavy burdens and responsibilities. And yet their salaries
rate a third. -and sometimes a half, lower than those of the
men with whom they teach.
They are forbidden to marry under penalty of dismissal
from office, and if their husbands drop into invalidlsm. or for
any other cause are unable to support them, the women cannot
be reinstated. In no other line of employment does this dis
crimination exist against married women. In Boston policemen
and firemen are pensioned after they have served the city a
specified number of years if they become disabled for further
employment. But when the teachers of Boston nave petition?*!
to be similarly pensioned and have presented a most feasible
scheme for the creation of a pension fund to be contributed b7
the teachers themselves, they have thus far received no en
couragement and have only been granted "leave to withdraw.*
Undoubtedly one cause of the smallness of the- pay ol
women teachers i3 the crowded state of the profession. Th<Â»
supply far exceeds the demand. In sixteen of the Atlantic ami
Gulf States, according to the census of 1S80, women largely
outnumbered men. In Massachusetts there are 70,000 women in
excess of men. a fact which has Its Influence in lowering the
wages of workingwomen everywhere. But Canon Klngsler
compressed the whole truth In one sentence: "Hear me, women!
You shall never have social equity till you have legal equality!"
This is a truth as fundamental as that which underlies th*
Golden Rule. To workinRwomen. aa to all Â¦women, the ballot is
a necessity. "Women must be made the leera.1 equals of men In,
order to obtain the rights belonging to them as citizens of a
republic. And the ballot is the only synonym of legal equality
that a republican government can know.
THE Republican State Convention was subject to two currents of control. In dealing
with the personalities which it had to consider there was present an element of revenge
and reprisal. The elements in this city which are potent only for evil in the party were
dominated by that influence which invaded its councils, to destroy its character, after the
election of 1898. Silently and unseen they had in secret conventicle decided to bestow
the richest fruits of that great victory upon the least worthy. Regardless of all the party's
future, they determined to make it unworthy of its high past by seeking to make Dan
Burns Senator. Outside the midnight circle of these conspirators there was but one
opinion of the result of such a choice. Republicans who look to the party for the State's
progress and the country's safety saw clearly that such wasting of a great opportunity
meant only defeat, humiliating and overwhelming, until men had forgotten the disgrace
and its authors. No such danger had ever before menaced the party from within or
without. The various forms of political opposition to Republicanism in this State had
never been able to plan such a blow. It was never within the compass of their resources.
The Republican party could be defeated as it was in 18S2, and rally again and win as' it
did in 1884. or go down as in 1886 and triumph as it did in 1890. It could fight to the
last for victory and lose it, as it did in 1894, and. forming again, win the field it had
lost, as it did in 1898. But if it cast off its high character like a worn garment and
gave up its best gift to a man like Dan Burnsr â that meant suicide, self-murder, and it
must rot under the waters of oblivion before it could rise and float even as a repulsive
object in the sight of men.
To save it from such an undeserved fate The Call led the rescue party. Our fight
against Burns was for the life and virtue of the party. We had no candidate, no friend . to
reward, and no enemy to punish, in a personal sense. The enemy of the party in its own
household was our enemy, and we fought him and his hosts, backed though he was by a
sinister influence the most intelligent, powerful and resourceful that has 'ever dominated
the politics of this State. As the battle progressed the Democracy cheered the corrupt
combination which, gorilla-like, was trying to kidnap California Republicanism. What
ever aid the political opposition could give was bestowed upon the gang which was try
ing to destroy Republicanism in its own temple.
With sleepless watchfulness The Call guarded and parried this strange and por
tentous alliance. Through the trying days and nights of the regular'session of the Leg
islature we never left a point unguarded. That session passed with the conspirators
balked, baffled and beaten, but the party had gained breathing space. The views which
we had sustained through the grimy affray were then subjected to a calm examination,
and were placed among the firm convictions honored by the party conscience.
With the extra session came another rally of the traitors to party supremacy and
the enemies of its welfare. But The Call had too deeply impressed the organization with
the policy of honor and decency, and short work was made of the combine which had
boasted itself invincible, and had bet on the irresistibility of its power. The party rose
and uttered as its own the principles which we had kept alive.
We did not expect that the defeated plotters would be content to go back to the
slums and stews, and burrow in the obscurity whence they issued to poison the great party
with their septic sins. %
They could not destroy the Republican party of California, which was their origi
nal policy. They abandoned that ambitious project and were compelled to rally their
diminished strength to avenge themselves upon a single individual. The proprietor of
The Call rejoices that the fatal blow which he parried from the head of the party fell
upon his own. for no greater devotion can a man show to the principles he supports than
to suffer that thev may survive.
This accounts for the turning of a party convention into a theater on which a con
; spiracy that failed to stab the party in the heart put a dagger into the back of one indi
i yidual. But the party is saved.
For the rest of it, the other current of control in the convention, set in motion
I by the element which regards only the welfare of the party, wisely ran to prudence in
' speech in the resolutions and purged them of inconsistent and entangling utterances upon
I national policies that are still without form and void, and can only be shaped and fash
| ioned by the National Convention. Fortunately, the conspirators who -programmed for
revenge. are incapable of urging any expression of principle or policy. So this was left to
i others, who, with admirable control and self-restraint, suppressed ail effervescent and
i undigested utterances, and left the party free to accept the wisdom of the National Con
; vention, without having first to disown follies of its own creation. â¢
For this the party is grateful, and girds its loins with better spirit for the great con
; flict that is coming. *

amended act declares: "Any person who shall will
fully or maliciously set on fire, or cause to be set on
fire, any timber, underbrush or grass upon the public
domain, or shall leave or suffer fire to burn unat
tended near any timber or other inflammable mi
tcrial, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and
upon conviction thereof in any District Court of the
United States having jurisdiction of the same shall
be fined in a sum not more than five thousand dol
lars or be imprisoned for a term not more than two
The warning is timely. The season of forest fires
has already begun in the East and will soon begin
here. The danger in this State is perhaps greater
than anywhere else ; owing to the large number of
campers who resort to the woods 'of the big parks
for their summer holidays. The fires that so fre
! quently occur are mainly the result of carelessness.
Fires are left smoldering instead of being completely
extinguished before those who kindled them leave the
spot, and then a slight wind fans them into flames
that soon spread into disastrous conflagrations. So
much damage has resulted from such practices that
the Government will hereafter be vigilant in prose
cuting offenders to the full extent of the law.
t It is certainly time for the beginning of active and
earnest efforts to protect our forests, and all intelli
gent citizens should unite with the Government offi
cials'in working to that end. The annual waste Â«jf
our woods through negligence and carelessness
amounts to- an enormous loss â one .whose "full ex
tent is incalculable. Sooner or later there will have
to be stringent laws on the subject in every State in
the Union. In the meantime those who have been
jcareless in the past will do well to take heed of the
law to which Mr. Kahn has called attention.
hoped to see imperial federation attained by men of
this generation.
Governments grow. Institutions do not long re
main in the condition of their foundation. Colonial
representation in the Privy Council and the House of ,
Lords would cither prove a useless concession to the*
colonies, or it would develop into a vast power sooner
or later, and as the colonies arc vigorous and enter
prising, their representation would more likely grow
than die. Thus Mr. Chamberlain's bill may be the
beginning of a governmental body destined to become
one of the most important in the world.
In the meantime, however, it is doubtful whether
the bill will be accepled. The Liberals in Parliament
have given notice of their opposition, and the Austra
lians have shown no signs of consenting to it. In
fact, several of the Australian leaders have declared
they will not consent to any alteration of the meas
ure adopted by the vote of the Australian people. It
is an issue which affects the world. at large, for out
of it there may come either a federation of. the Brit
ish empire or the establishment of an independent
Australian republic, and either event would have far-,
reaching effects upon the course of. history. -
AUSTRALIA AND THE EMPIRE.
PRESENTING the Australian commonwealth :
bill to Parliament on Monday, Joseph Cham
berlain, Secretary for the Colonies, stated the
Imperial Government is willing to accept the bill ns
adopted by the Australians, with the sole exception of
clause 74, which declares the Federal Court of Aus
tralia shall be the tribunal of final appeal on all ques
tions arising under the bill. That clause, Mr. Cham
berlain said, would abolish the imperial veto and
would virtually make Australia an independent re
public. He announced that' the Government would
strike out the objectionable clause, and for the pur
pose of satisfying Australian sentiment would intro
duce a bill giving Australia, Canada. India and South
Africa representation in the Privy Council.
If the policy be carried out the Privy Council will
become a court of the much discussed imperial fede
ration, and may develop into something like a Sen
ate. Each of the four great colonial groups is to have
one representative, who is to hold office for seven
years. , Upon these representatives life peerages ar.;
to be bestowed, so that when their term of service as
law lords of the Privy Council is over they will con
tinue to sit as members of the House of Lords.
The plan, it will be seen, is likely to prove attractive
to the ambitious leaders of the colonies. It means
that every seven years one cf them in each of the
federated colonies is to attain a peerage. It means,
moreover, that in the House of Lords there will be
hereafter a strong body of colonial statesmen to take
part in directing imperial affairs. Evidently such a
policy is bound to be pleasing to men who ?ee an
avenue for their own advancement to higher honors
than they could ever gain in the colonies themselves,
and it will be 'attractive, moreover, to all who have
THE SAX FEAIS'CISCO CALL THURSDAY, MAY 17, 1900.
I \ECENTLY when questioned about his occupa-
V~< tion Colonel Bryan said he was not a farmer,
but an agriculturist. The New York Press de
fines this by saying: "A farmer is a man who tills
the soil. An agriculturist is a man who tills the
iarrr.er."'
Perhaps that fixes Color.el Bryan's -status as accu
rately as possible. He certainly puts his tongue to
the farmer more often than he puts his hand to the
plow. His function in life seems to be the effort to
convince the farmer that he is unhappy when he is
happy, in misery when he feels we'll, and in bad lurk
when he pays off a mortgage.
We would, however, take Colonel Bryan out of the
agricultural class and put him among the manufac
turers. It is his business to manufacture grievances.
He spins them out of his own head, as a silkworm
spins its thread out of its bowels.
When prices were low and interest high. he manu
factured that into a grievance. Now that conditions
are reversed, and prices are high and interest low,
that also is made into a grievance. He accused the
"money power" of making low prices and high in
terest, and now he accuses the same power of rever
sing the operation and effect. He evidently treats
the gold standard as a double ender. and whichever
way it works he views it with alarm. with solicitude,
with repugnance, with aversion, with apprehension,
with anxiety, and so on to the end of the long cata
logue of words which express discontent.
To his mind the public liver is in a morbid, torpid,
inactive and abnormal condition, no matter what hap
pens; and he is the only original liver-pad and he
patic poultice capable of making it smile like an in
fant in its mother's arms.
Shakespeare describes the scurvy politician â pre
tending to sec the things he does not.
Surely Colonel Bryan sees things in the condition
of the country and people which are hidden from
others. As the prophet of 1896 he failed utterly. His
prophecies went wider of the mark than the shells
which Spanish gunners fired at our ships. Now he
is in the field as a political chemist, analyzing preser.t
conditions, and finds them so bad that he is surprised
that the hide of the poor old country is not on the
fence.
The telephone corporation in Chicago charged the
city such an enormous price for telephones in the
various municipal offices that after vain efforts to get
a reduction the city government determined to es
tablish a municipal system. As soon as steps were
taken to that end the company came to terms. The
city telephone bill last year amounted to $7500. This
year it will have the same service over the same wires
for $2250. Chicago is speedy, but it will pay San
Francisco to follow her footsteps fast enough to
keep in sight of her.

pays a promissory note for $50, now held
by Rauer's Collection Agency. Three days
ago judge Cook gave judgment against
Rauer's concern in a suit brought for
$12$ 43 against Ralph Knapp. When the
Judge announced his decision Rauer, who
appeared very angry, said:
"Your decision is an outrage. Three
reputaDle witnesses have testified that
Knapp owes this money. I'll fix you up
for this." e
Judge Cook thought nothing of the lncl

pay the money on the note and he natur
ally thought that Rauer had taken this
method to retaliate for not getting Judg
ment for his client.
"I believe Rauer has threatened me with
attachment proceedings," said Judge
Cook, "because I decided against him. Out
of sixty-five cases that was the first one
which he lost. I borrowed 550 from Rauer
on a note during the last campaign, but

WILLIAM WORDSWORTH
hibit the medieval Joy in color, expressed
with all the power and splendor of the re
naissance. Richness, luxuryâ two very
un-Greek characteristicsâ the favorite
words with Keats, and hfa advice to Shel
ley to curb his magnanimity and load
every rift of thÂ« subject with ore is an
other Instance- of the predominance of this
quality.
But Keats drew from medievalism not
only hit love of color, but that strange
and haunting charm which Arnold has
baptized "natural magic." In this quality
Scott, with all his love for the romantic
past. Is quite deficient. He loved the stir
and action of the medieval world, its
strong contrasts and clear types. But
Keats penetrated below the surface and
caught thÂ« magic and mystery of things.
It Is hardly too much to say that there iÂ»
more of the true spirit of romance In "The
Eve of St. Agnes than In alt the Waver
ley novels bound toother. We feel this
charm not only In Keafs' descriptions of
nature â almost every line of the "Ode to
the Nightingale" could be quoted as. an
exampleâ but even more In hi3 dealings
with the supernatural. The ghost In "Isa
bella" is far beyond the reach not only of
Scott, but of any poÂ«Â»t of his day. and the
little posthumous ballad of "La Belle
Dame Sans Merct" 1?. to use Arnold's fine
phrase, "drenched and . Intoxicated Â¦with
the fairy dew of natural magic." Tt Is
this quality more than anything else that
constitutes the peculiar charm of Keats.
It keeps his love of luxury and richness

It is seen in his absolutely direct and

But there Is something more than th!a

from a family famous in Scottish history
and tradition, he turned with enthusiasm
to the chronicles and legends of his coun
try. He swept the Border for the swiftly
perishing songs and ballads of the oUl
moss-trooper days and gave them to th*
world In the "Minstrelsy of the Scottish,
Border." Upon this collection his firÂ«t
original poem, the "Lay of the Last Min

expansion of the old ballad into the metri

Poets of Opposition and Indifference.
During his second visit to France he
formed a close friendship with .Michael
Beaupuy. the noblest type of the repub
lican soldier, and learned at first hand
the causes of the revolution and the
sources of Its strength. During his stay
in Paris In the autumn of 1T&2 he even
meditated throwing himself into the strife
of factions in the wild hope that his voice
might recall the nation from the path of
blood. Recalled to England, by the stop
page of supplies, his return was soon fol
lowed by the news of the execution of the
King and the tragic fall of his own
friends, the Girondists. Wordsworth has
left a lasting record in the "Prelude" of
the effect the Terror made upon his mind.
For long years afterward his sleep was
haunted with visions of despair and im
plements of death, or he saw himself
pleading in vain before the savage tri
bunals of the Mountain. But even yet he
did not despair of the republic. On the
outbreak of war he sympathized with
France rather than with his own country
and shared all the hatred of the English
radicals for the reactionary policy of Pitt.
Little by little, however, as the revolu
tion changed Its character. Wordsworth
lost hope in the movement with which he
had so passionately sympathized. He be

composed in 17S5-96. is a revelation of the
depths to which his mind had sunk.
trom this nadir of moral despair
\\ ordsworth recovered by a slow and
gradual process. The peaceful scenery of
the English country, the gentle ministra
tions of his sister Dorothy, the stimulat
ing influence of Coleridge, and most of all
his own abiding sympathy with the Joys
and sorrows of the country folk among
whom nls life was spent, at last restored
him to the state of hope and joy which
he once seemed to have lost forever. We
find the first evidence of his complete re
covery in the glorious "LJnes Composed
Near Tintern Abbey." At last when the
military despotism of France was incar
nated In Napoleon and England entered
upon her epic struggle against this tre
mendous power Wordsworth was recon
ciled to his country. He felt that the
parts had been exchanged and that Eng
land now stood aa the champion of lib
erty. And with this feeling he poured out
a series of sonn.ets dedicated to liberty
which remain to-day the noblest monu
ment in English literature of the Napo
leonic wars. From this time on Words
worth remained unchanged, a Conserva
tive and a Nationalist, peeking for, free
dom rather in the liberation of the Indi
vidual mind than in any change of politi
cal institutions.
' Of all his critics Arnold has perhaps
best summed up the cause of Words
worth's greatness. It lies in the "extra
ordinary power with which Wordsworth
feels the Joy offered to us in nature the
joy offered to us in the simple primary
: affections and duties and in the extraor-
Qlnary power with which he shows us
this joy and renders It so as to make us
share it." In other words, the poet's
greatness consists in his matter and his
manner, or rather in the peculiar har
mony of matter and manner which at his
highest he attains. And Wordsworth
; reached his hignest more than once or
twice. He has left as no other Rnslish
poet since Milton has done "a great and

mon folk about him. But his sympathies
were all the deeper for their limitation,
and through them he restored or rather
created a new field for the play of po
etic power, "the simple primary affections
and duties" as seen in the lives of the
great mass of mankind.. Here, as in na
ture, he finds the divine element of truth
and love, and hence, also, he draws jov
and strength.
Wordsworth's manner has two charac
teristicsâsimplicity and sublimity They
are found apart and united. At times
unfortunately, one is degraded into a flat
ness of commonplace that Is almost un
paralleled in literature. This Is his *o
caljert "thick-ankled" style. At times th?
other Is swollen to an absurd pomposity
which renders tuo many passages of the
"Prelude" and "Excursion" a byword and
a derision. But it is not of these that the
lover of "Wordsworth cares â¢ to think
Rather he turns to the divine simplicity
of the "Fountain" or the "Solitary Reap
er." to the divine sublimity of the noblÂ»<Â«t
odes and sonnets, or to rarer and greater
work, where, in Arnold's words, "Nature
herself seems to take the pen out of his
hand and to write for him with her own
bare, sheer, penetrating power." it is In
such passages as these that Wordsworth
displays that almost miraculous "healing
power" which is his alone in English uo
etry.
Wordsworth sprang from an old Nor
thumbrian stock and grew up among
the lakes and hills of Westmoreland.
From the very first the influence of nat
ural surroundings at once stern and beau
tiful sank deep into his mind. Bjjt his
boyhood was not that of a poetic dreamer.
Rough, hardy and fearless, he ran wild
over the hills about his home. His mother
spoke of him as the only one of her chil
dren for whom she felt anxiety, owing to
his "stiff, moody and violent temper."
The . popular conception of Wordsworth
as the placid poet of country pleasures
Is due probably to the many pictures of
him In his peaceful old age. But this
peace was won only by a conquest over
violent passions. And In his youth these
passions were inextricably Intertwined
with the French Revolution.
. In 1790. during the last year of his stay
at Cambridge, Wordsworth made a tour
on foot through France and Switzerland.
He found "a whole nation mad with Joy In
consequence of the revolution," and with
this passion every fiber of his being sym
pathized. To the child of the northern
hills liberty was as the very breath he
drew, and from the beginning Joy was to
Wordsworth a necessary element of life.

Nome at 2 p. m. to-day. She was to have
gone Tuesday, but some alterations had
to be made.
M. d'Agostine. Rn employe of the Amer
ican Cream of Tartar Works at North
Beach, was badly scalded yesterday. lie
was removing a cap from a retort, when
the steam rushed out and burned him
terribly about the hands, forearms, face,
neck and forehead. He was treated by
Dr. Thome at the Harbor Hospital and
the chances are he will recover.
The barge Fort Brags and the steamer
Monticello were in collision yesterday
morning. The Monticello lost her port
rail, while the barge was very little dam
aged.

enty-three hospital corps men. seven con
tract nurses and a number of civilian em
ployes and the wives and children of of

Morning Star Sails.
The Harbor Commissioners held a very
important meeting yesterday. Messrs.
Kilburn, Harney and Herold are doing
everything- in their power to put the water
front in the best possible shape in order
to meet the increased demand of ship
ping facilities, and before next season
comes around they will have succeeded.
At yesterday's meeting they let contracts
for the building of the new fishermen's
wharf at North Beach and the repairing
of the new Santa Fe ferry slip at
Main street wharf. The plans and speci
fications for a shed over Howard street
wharf No. 3 (pier 10) were adopted and
bids for the work will be called for at
once, while Goodall, Perkins & Co. and
the Oregon Coal and Navigation Company
were notified that they would be required
to surrender possession of seawall Iot3
Xos. H and 13 about May 1, 1901.
The trade and importance of the port of
San Francisco is growing by leaps and
bounds and the Commissioners recognise
this fact. In a few months the new
steamers of the Oceanic Company will be
ready for service and the first steamer of
the American-Hawaiian line was launched
from the Union Iron Works last Satur
day. The new steamers for the Pacific
Mail are nearing completion at Newport
News, while a host of vessels are being
built for the coast trade. In view of ail
this rush the commission has decided to
rush the improvement of the water front
to a completion, and as the big lots used
by Goodail, Perkins & Co. as storerooms
and repair shops and the Oregon Coal
and Navigation Company as a coalyard
will be required in a short time for the
use of the railroads the companies were
notified to be prepared to move.
The bidding for the erection of the new
fishermen's wharf at North Beach was
very spirited. There were seven bidders
and between the figures of lour of them
there was only 540O difference. The City
Street Improvement Company got the job
for $4127 3?. while the bid of the Dundon
Bridge Company was $4213 and the Hyde
Construction Company $4434. The work of
repairing the car terry slip at Main street
wharf was let to Darby Laydon & Co.
for S15S0. the City Street- Improvement
Company being the next lowest bidder,
with an offer of J1&S1 84.
Main street wharf was considerably
damaged by vessels docking there while
the work of repairing was going on. A
report of the chief wharfinger to the Com
missioners set forth that the damage
done by the ship Servia was $51 40; an un
known vessel, $57 36; schooner Maweema,
$240 10; steamer Crescent City, $16 20;
steamer Tellus. 535 57, and steamer Na
tional city, $41 S3.

BRYANT MAKES
CHARGES AGAINST
THE FAIR SIDE
Do San Francisco husbands have more
privileges and enjoy more indulgences
than those of other cities twrause of the
more accelerated "pace" of this Califor
nia metropolis? An intimation to this
effect was made yesterday In the Craven-
Fair case by Attorney Charles Pence, re
cently' from Colorado, and Judge Troutt
may feel called upon to settle thi3 point
for the matrons of San Francisco.
Mr. Pence opened the argument on be
half of Mrs. Craven at 1:30 p. m. and
closed at 4. He is not an orator, as is his
brother, but he is clear and forcible and
delivered an able argument, replete with
law and legal decision. His entire talk
was on the California law of marriage in
the year 1892 and what constituted a legal
tying of the nuptial bond at that time,
when Mrs. Craven claims she became the
wife of James G. Fair. He referred at
FAIR CASE ARGUMENTS.
Charles Pence Is Impressed "With the
"Rapid Pace" of California's
Metropolis.
H. X. Bryant, the "hobo witness" of
Craven-Fair notoriety, has made some
more sensational allegations. This time
he makes direct charges that representa
tives of the Fair heirs attempted to bribe
him.
"It Is not for money." said Bryant yes
terday, "that I have come forward with
the story that Senator Fair told me he
was not the husband of^Mrs. Craven. If
money and not fair play Vas all I desired
I cculd have had that long ago. Time and
again men have come to me from the
Fair forces with offers of money If 1
would go upon the stand before Judge
Troutt and swear that I had testified
falsely at my examination.
"All of these offers have been Indignant
ly refused by me. I spurned the attempts
of the Fair people to induce me to change
my testimony. The Penccs made no offer
to pay me and I asked for no remunera
tion. I thought of course that as I had
neglected my business in Oakland for
nearly a week and held down the witness
stand for that period I would at least be
paid for the time lost. I calculated that
my time would be worth $200 or $300.
"As for the woman Mrs. Horton, or as
I knew her, Miss June Payne, when she
appeared on the stand and told the jury
that 1 deliberately lied when I made the
statement that I had borrowed money
from Fair for her, I expected the Fences
would protect me from her statements." 5
Offered Him Money, He Says, to
Swear Dead Senator Never Told
Him He Had Married
Mrs. Craven.
MAY KILL OFF
GAME WITH MY
KIND OF A GUN
Circuit Judge Ross Knocks
Out Marin County
Ordinance.
Judge Ross, sitting as a United States
Circuit Judge, decided yesterday that the
Marln County pump-gun ordinance, bo.
called, was void because it conflicts with
the fourteenth amendment to the consti
( tution of the United States, which guar
j antecs to every citizen the enjoyment of
life, liberty and property.
The case originated in the habeas cor
pus petition of W. A. Marshall. Mr. Mar
shall was convicted by a Marin County
Justice of the Peace of having shot with
a repeating shotgun, on January 12 of this
year, one blue jay and one quail, the use
of a repeating or magazine shotgun being
prohibited by an ordinance passed by the
Board of Supervisors. He appealed to the
United States Circuit Court on the ground
that the ordinance was unconstitutional.
Judge Ross, in rendering his decision,
said that the shotgun was the property of
Marshall and that he used it on his own
ground. It had been shown, he said, that
the gTin was less destructive than the
double-barreled automatic ejector shot
gun cot prohibited by the ordinance. Guns
are not made for ornament but for use,
said the Judge. To deprive the petitioner
of the use of his gun is to deprive him of
j the use of his property. If Marln County
may lawfully prohibit the use of the gun
j in question every other county and every
j other State and Territory may do the
Â¦ same, thus practically destroying the
) manufacture of this kind of gun for the
I shooting of game within the United

Judge Cook made an order yesterday
suspending for ten days the force and
effect of the writ of mandate heretofore
issued compelling the Board of Fire Com
missioners to advertise for bids for con
tracts to shoe the department horses.
This was done to enable the Commission

Is quoted as saying, In fact, that prices which
manufacturers are now paying for wool will
enable them to make light weights which can
be sold at nearly last year's prices. From this
time on, therefore, the trade are inclined to
look for more business In the wool market. The

NEW YORK. May 16.â Stocks of railroad
companies made a demonstration of persistent
strength In the stock market to-day. What
ever unfavorable factors developed during the
day were ignored or their Influence resisted
and the resulting declines overcome. The bear
element was so far impressed by the show of
strength that they retired from the field be
fore the day was over and did not repeat
yesterday's maneuver of a raid on the Indus
trial quarter, which on that occasion upset
the market in the last fifteen minutes of the
trading. The market showed itself .much less
sensitive than for some time past to any de
pressing lnlluence and the close was distinctly
firm et about the best level of the day. The
stocks of Western railroads were easily the
leaders In the movement and buying was at
tributed to Western account as for several
days past. This Western buying is believed j
in Wall street to be covering an outstanding
short interest, prompted by the good crop
weather and the favorable conditions in the
winter wheat belt. The leadership shifted from !
Burllngrton to Atchlson preferred, which scored j
a clean net gain of 2 points. The approach of !
the dividend meeting and the circulation of j
rumors that the stock would be placed on a j
0 per cent basis were used with effect. Bur- ]
llngrton continued aggressively strong and j
scored an advance of 1% In spite of dentals
1 ' the recent rumors that a refunding plan i
was about to be announced. Xorthern Pa- '
cine gained as much and the strength of these !
stocks affected the other Pacific and ultimately j
t!)Â» trunk lines, which rose 1 to l'/i points.
The steel stocks all bounded sharply on cover
ing by shorts on denials of assertions that
general shut-downs were Imminent on account
of prospective demands for Increase of wages.
The early weakness of Sugar, People's Gas.
the Tobacco stocks and other industrials was
met by denials of various rumors which ac
companied the decline. Recoveries ensued on |
the demand from the bears caught short, and j
besides this weakness In the industrial list
the market had to contend with the announce
ment of gold engagements for export to-mor
row of fully a million dollars In excess of the
preliminary estimate. To-morrow's shipments
foot up fully $3,150,000 for France. But the
continued ease of money here relieved all ap- 1
prehension. The call loan rates fell to lÂ»i
per cent and the gains by banks from the
sut -treasury and on the interior movement of
currency will evidently offset the gold ex
port. Although the advance In stocks was
generally wiped out when the gold engage
ments were announced the upward movement
was resumed on further consideration of the
circumstances.
The bond market was dull and only partly
shared in the strength of stocks. Total sales
par value, $1,185,000.

Condition of General Trade.
The New Tnrk circular of Henry Clews says:
"Th* reactionary movement In the stock mar
ket developed further strength last week and
the tendency has been much Ices bullish than
two weeks ago. Good reasons exist for a
Â¦trletlj- moderate reaction. Values of good
properties were often pretty high; and more
or less liquidation of speculative accounts was
inevitable in the absence of fresh stimulus to
outride buying.
â¢'The most Important setback originated In
the Iron and Eteel stocks, which declined owing
to unfavorable reports of the iron trade. This
great branch of Industry, however, is not go
ing to destruction; H Is still enjoying pros
perity, and is likely to continue, so doing for
months and possibly years to come. The worst
that can be said Is that the abnormal rush
of orteia. the like of which was never before
cxperSencefi, has subsided; and the extreme
prices which buyerf paid In their panic-lik*
anxiety are new a thing of the past. De
mand Is temporarily abating: production Is In
creasing, and values must soon reach a more
norraal basis: ana this may not be accom
plished without seme Injury to the poorly j
equipped and poorly organised concerns which i
ourht never to have fr.tered the race of com
petition. This condition is no surprise to thosÂ»
enjra^M in the iron business; a reaction has
long been foreseen, and as soon as prices have
settied down to a lower and more reasonable
t*Â«'.s It ie more thxin probable that a new
set of orders will be received; there being many
enterprise*. Improvements and enlargements
which have been postponed owing to the hlch
prices of Iron. While the readjusting process
in thÂ» iro& trade, may Injure those unprepared
it will n-suit in piacln? that great industry
on Â«. nr'jnger and more enduring state of
prosperity than Just new exists. The United
Etatee. with its unlimited eupplies of cheap
oret. Its unrivaled mear.s of transportation
and It* unequaled eklJl in the art of manu
facturing on a iarpe scale win lead the world
in iron manufacturing. If Indeed It has not al
ready reached the position of leader. Already
we are cuccossfuliy placing our Iron products,
frorr. yip iron to locomotives, to typewriters
and hundreds of other articles In the foreign
markets hitherto controHed by England and
GÂ«rmai:y. Our fiuceees in these fields is an
afMjre-d fact.; the future Is elmply a matter
cf growth. In the future the Iron industry
will no longer be solely dependent upon the
fcoti^e market, end the periods of excessive con
gestion which that meant will be fewer and
far botwe^n. for the foreign markets will offer
an unlimited field If properly cultlx-ated to
American enterprise for year* to come \\>
ere accurtemed In this country to Knells of
violent depression arter every period of un
urual activity, and It will be Interesting to
observe cÂ« to how far them? new outlets for
our furj'lus wt'J save us from the effects of
overwupply and reaction.
"General trade rhows some signs of l*>rg ac
tivity, but not more than oouM be reasonably
expected after the rush of the past six months.
In the textile trade* the pace has been a llttl"
too fast In some respects and buyers finding
values unsettled are holding off until their
large farly purchases are dis:>c*ed of. In some
line* of groceries there are sifrns of overbuying,
and eimilar report* are heard here And there
from other trades. An a whole, however, the
business situation Is round and promising. ThÂ»
approach of n Presidential election act* as a
deterrent 5n Feme quarter*, much more than
it really shrmJd, but there is every prospect
of a renewed revival of business when the
?lections have been discounted and values
brought down to & more normal level."

weather. It being too wet in the Southwest and

Harrison's circular says:
"Ther<Â» has not been an arrival of coal from
Australia since the Moana left, and but one,
the Kensington, In over sixty days; the writer
does not remember a parallel case In twenty
five years. The result Is, there Is no Colonial
coal in yard here at present, in fact It is but
little inquired for, as large consumers have
been educatsd to substitute our coast products,
which appear to answer their purposes, and
the cost' to them is less, as the coal freights
at present rule from Newcastle. The high
freights, the scarcity of tonnage there and the
brisk demand for Honolulu have comblnedly
weaned the local public from its use, hence
colonial coals will only regain this market by
low prices, or certainly a shade below British
Columbia offerings, although heretofore It was
sought for at a premium over our coast prod
ucts. There are forty-three vessels reported
chartered for coal from the colonies, this Is an
increase of seven since the Moana left: some
of these will not arrive here this year. Freight
rates from Newcastle are a little easier, but
tonnage Is not plentiful for here, as Honolulu
is a more profitable port to seek for the mo
ment. It is expected the demand for the
Hawaiian Islands will diminish later on; this
will divert tonnage in our direction, besides
grain freights are firm at full figures, which
must cause shipowners to seek this port for
business."

FRUIT GROWERS
ABOUT TO COMBINE
Fear Cannery Trust Is Scheming
to Cut Down Prices of Their
Products.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
HIS Broadway, May 16.
THE fruit growers of San Leandro
have taken the first step toward or
ganizing the combining interests of
this county into an organization
which they hope will become State wide.
The first meeting was held in San Lean
dro last night and a temporary organiza
tion effected, with Charles R. Jones as
chairman and Daniel McCarthy as secre
tary. To-day the organizers of the new
move are out scouring the county to get
the fruit growers Into San Leandro on
Saturday evening, when a permanent or
ganization Is to be effected.
This Is the most important move that
has been made within the fruit Interests
since the combination of the canneries,
and it is being made in order to offset the
canneries combination. As San Leandro
and Hay wards are the center of the fruit
Interests of the county, and as they are
the most Important places in the whole
State for cherries and apricots, the im
portance of the move becomes at onco
manifest.
The cause of the move is the fear that
the cannery combination Is going to force
down the prices of fruit. The cherry
picking season begins in a very few days
and yet not a pound of cherries has been
contracted for by the canneries. This has
frightened the fruit growers, who see In
this all kind of possibilities of trouble.
They do not know what they are going to
do with their fruit, and they are trying to
find some means of disposing of their pro
duct.
In the years gone by it waa customary
for the buyers of the different canneries
to visit the fruit centers before the season
of gathering began. These buyers' would
make contracts with the fruit growers for
their produce and the fruit growers would
then know just what they were going to
get -for their fruit when picked. This was
done several times a year, as the different
fruits began to ripen, and in the ordinary
course of events the cherry buyers should
have been around several weeks ago.
The growers around San Leandro â and
there are many of themâ believe, an., at
tempt is about to be made to force down
prices, and they determined to meet or
ganization with organization. As a re
sult of this .determination- an. exciting
meeting was held last night, at which
about twenty-nve' fruit-growers were
present. Charles R. Jones was elected
chairman of the meeting and Daniel Mc-
Carthy secretary. Speeches were made by

Â¦ Some of- the speakers cal!a4 attention to
the fact that the fruit growers of San
Leandro* hAd, raised a bonus of JoOOO
which was presented to the King-Morse
Canning Company In consideration of the
cannery being erected at San L,eandro.
San Leandro now has one of the largest
j canneries In the world, but after getting
the bonus from the people of the town the
Kinjy-Morse people went into the cannery
combine and are now engaged in trying to
force down the price of fruit, so that the
growers who gave the bonus thinking it
would help their business are not now
sure that they can get enough out of their
fruit to pay for the picking.
I. H. Begier advocated the formation of
another cannery, if prices went against
the growers, and that the growers put up
their own fruit and make not only the
profit of the grower but the profit of. the
canner.
The most serious proposition advanced
w.as that all of the fruits capable of being
dried be shipped to San Jose, dried, and
that the growers market the dried fruit
themselves, taking chances upon the dried
fruit market rather than the possibility of
meeting the prices of the cannery com
bine.
"The trouble Is," said Daniel McCarthy,
secretary of the organization, "that none
of the fruit growers know where they are
at. â¢ Usually they have made their con

what they are going Jo get for their fruit

Resolved. That the Point Lobos Improvement
Club, volcinn the sentiments of the r>eople of
the Richmond District, do In the most forcible
and eirphatlo manner possible protest against
the Board of Supervisors passing the proposed
Magulre ordinance cutting streetcar fares to

A resolution was also adopted censuring
the Board of Public Works for its extrav
agance, and asking that some action be
taken to make this board show some
thing for the expenditure of- this money
other than a big Ealary roll.
George R. Fletcher introduced a reso
lution, which was carried, asking that
the Board of Supervisors set aside in the
next tax levy the sum of $0000 for the pav
ing of the south half of Fulton street
from Stanyan street to First avenue with
basalt blocks: also for the erection of
more electric lights for the Richmond dis

S. B. Tucker, a young man ID years old,
residing with his parents at 2116 Howard
street and employed in the freight depart
ment of the Southern Pacific at Fourth
and King streets, was held up and robbed
at 9 o'clock last night, on Seventeenth
street.
Tucker had received hla month's wages
from the pay car and started uptown to
make some purchases. Finding the store
closed he walked down Fourth street to
Polsom and boarded a car, riding Â¦" as far
as Seventeenth street, when he got off
and started for his home aloug that thor
oughfare, with his hands in his pockets,
jingling his money. He had just gone
about twenty yards on Seventeenth stieet
when he was confronted by a thick-set
man, who placed a Colt's navy pistol
against his stomach and commanded him
to hold up his hands and shell out. '
Tucker did as directed, whereupon the
robber forced his left hand Into his pocket
and extracted $35 In gold. Ho then com
manded Tucker to proceed and not look
behind under penalty of having a hole put
through him. Tucker hastened to the
Seventeenth-street police station and in
formed Lieutenant Anderson of what had
occurred.
Detectives Fitzgerald and Graham, with
Officer Winters, were rushed out on the
run to the scene of the robbery, accom
panied by Tucker. A careful search was
made in and about the place, but no traco
could be found of the' footpad. .
Tucker gave a good description of the
robber and said he would be able to iden
tify him if he saw him again. He said
the man was dressed In dark clothing,
with a short sack coat, dark shirt, with
a four-in-hand whitish necktie, a brown
Fedora hat 'and dark trousers that looked
like jeans. He was cleanly shaven, about
24 years of age and about 5 feet 8 Inches
In height. He wore no. mask.

BERKELEY, May 16.â The first class
UOder the direction of President
Benjamin Ide Wheeler and the pio
neer class of the Greater Univer
sity of California* was- sent into the world
this afternoon to win its laurels. Two
hundred and fifty young men and women
from professional and academic colleges
were rewarded with diplomas for their
four years of hard wark.
Long before the hour set for the com
mencement procession the campus was
dotted with the gowns of the graduatesâ
the first time they have been worn by
any class of the University of California.
"fhe graduates of the various academic
and professional colleges formed in line,
two abreast, at North Hall and the fac
ulty and alumni formed at the Library
building. At the sound of the bugle the
procession started, winding around North
Hall to the path leading to the gymna
sium, whore the exercises were held. The
crowd which had not been admitted to
the building thronged the doorways' and
greeted the members of the class as they
advanced. At the entrance tu the build
ing the candidates for degrees halted and
separated into two files, permitting the
undergraduates, alumni, fellows, assist

other faculty members to enter the build

Edwin Milton Wilder, B. L. of the Medi
cal College, made the first address and
took for his subject, "The Necessity of
Medical School9 in a System of Public In
struction." He spoke strongly in favor
of the Stateâ meaning the American Gov
ernmentâtaking Into its hands the edu
cation, and training of all . its medical
graduates and preventing the giving of
medical diplomas by private corporations.
He said:
"It would be more advisable that the
State remove the matter of such train
ing from the whims of private individuals
and corporations, but when the whole in
tellectual fiber of the time is threatened,
and 4t is only by a widespread and em
phatic teaching of the principles of
healthful life that an ultimate calamity
can be averted under such circumstances,
does it not become absolutely imperative
that the State take, into its own hands
tlifi education of its medical advisers."

TWO NEW YORKERS.
One Gives the Other a Handy Lift.
Mr. E. C. Hazard, one of the oldest
and best-known wholesale Rrocers â¢ in
New York, has for many years given
his attention to the preparation of fine
food delicacies. He has a farm and ex-
periment station down on Star en Isl-
end, where the famous Shrewsbury
Ketchup, Burnt Onion Sauce. Shews-
bury Mushrooms and other delicacies
are prepared in a most skillful manner.
One evening last autumn while on his
way home Mr. H. sat with one of the
officials of the N. J. C. Railroad, who
seemed to be living with one foot in the
grave â stomach so badly disordered
that nothing would digest. It seemed
only a question of a few weeks, at most,
when death would come.
"Mr. Hazard insisted upon takinp; the
gentleman to his house and giving him a
package of Grape-Nuts breakfast food
which is manufactured by the Postum
Cereal Co. at the pure food factories at
Battle Creek. Mich., a food which Mr.
Hazard had been using at his own table
for a long time, greatly to his benefit
"He told the fjentleman that he could
pet well in a few weeks by the use of
perfectly prepared food of this sort, and
would never forget the day when he first
tried Grape-Nuts. The prediction came
true; the official is not only alive to-day
but is in better health than he has expe-
rienced for many years, all of which he
attributes to the use of Grape-Nuts and
from the advice of Mr. Hazard."
There are two reasons for this: in the
first place, Grape-Nuts are made from
certain selected portions of wheat
and barley that contain phosphate of
potash and albumen, which nature uses
in the humnn system to make up the
gray matter in the brain and nerve cen-
ters throughout the body.
The nervous system directly controls
the digestive machinery and the brain
controls the working and. money mak-
ing power. Mr. Hazard knows this
from his knowledge of foods and from
his own experience with Grape-Nuts
Therefore when he took the railway ofTu
cial in charge he knew exactly what "he
was doing, and the result proved the
correctness of his knowledge.

for Texas last Monday. Mr. Heise ad
vised him to take a check for the money
and send it to San Francisco for collec
tion as soon as he reached his destina
tion. Old Kuechenmeister had enough
money in gold to keep him going for a
month and in ordinary circumstances
would not have needed to use the check
until the cash was forthcoming.
When Kuechenmeister got back to his
hotel with the check he was told that he
would have all kinds of trouble in cash
ing- it and was strongly advised to get the
cash. He accordingly remained over
Monday night, missing his train, and go
ing to Heise's store explained the situa
tion. The latter at once got on the cars
with the old man and together they went
to the Germania Trust Company, where
the check was instantly cashed upon pre
sentation. KuechenmeiBter took $300 in
greenbacks, which he placed in an inside
vest pocket, and the gold he was pour
ing into the inside pocket of his coat as
he walked out of the bank.
From the Germania Trust Company
Helse and Kuechenmeister went to the
office of the Santa Fe to see if the ticket
on which he should have left for Texas \
on Monday night was still good. Finding
that it was, Heise bade him good-by and
started for a Valencia-street car.
Two minutes later Kuechenmeister was
struck from behind, and fell in a heap on
the sidewalk. Some one Immediately fell
on top of him, and while pretending to
raise him from the sidewaik went through
his pockets and got away with all the
twenties his hand could hold.
Heise noticed the disturbance and re
turned to find his old friend sitting on the
curbstone half dazed. When he learned
what had happened he reported the mat
ter to the police. Captain Seymour and'
his men have been on the case ever since.
Captain Seymour tried his best to get old
Kuechenmeister to remain in San Fran

The opening of the spring exhibition of
the Sketch Club last evening was a most
delightful affair. The attendance was a
large and fashionable one and the show-

creditable. AH the rooms In the tiny cot
tage of the club at 131S California street
were given over to the exhibition and In
them were shown respectively pastels,
water-colors, oil3, black and whites and
designs, all the work of club members.
Miss Helen Hyde sent from Japan some
delightful Japanese sketches In water
colors that were given a good place and
were much admired. Mrs. Mary I. Brad

erable attention.
Mrs. Albertine Randall "WTieelan, as

OLD MAN ROBBED
OF HIS GOLD IN
BROAD DAYLIGHT
After Leaving the Santa Fe Office for
the Ferries He Was Knocked
Down and His Money
Stolen.
One of the most daring hold-ups ever
perpetrated In San Franciscto took place
on Market street before the noon hour
last Tuesday. In the presence of at least
100 people and with half a dozen police
men within call, an old man was knocked
down and robbed of over J2tXÂ». Captain
Seymour and half a dozen of his best de
tectives are now at work on the case,
but the chances are that not a clew to
the highwaymen will ever be found.
Early In April two elderly Germans,
L.udTrig Kuechenmelster and Josef Wen
zel, arrived here from Baltimore and reg
istered at the Valencia Hotel at 718-722
Valencia street. Kuechenmeister paid his
board and lodging up to May 14, on which
day he was scheduled to leave for Texas.
Wenzel paid as he went along, but that
was only for a few days, as one morning
he was found dead in bedâ asphyxiated.
A Coroner's jury found it a case of mo
noxoid poisoning and the case is now
nearly forgotten.
As soon as Kuechenmeister was settled
In the hotel he hunted up an old friend of

In hiF petition ifr~ District Attorney avers
that Marc^au stand. 1 * oharprivi with the

the Penal Code. He assorts that the ap

In conclusion the District Attorney al

asks that a porscn having r.o private in

Collis P. Huntington gave hi3 "annual"
last night and they were all there, every
mother's son of them. Employes grown
gray in the service and the young- blood
that has come from the far East to re
juvenate the company sat around the
oval-shaped board and bowed In obeisance
to the lordly ruler of tne banquet feast,
eating of his viands and drinking of his
proffered waters. Xot a hitch nor a fal
ter marred the dinner which was served
in the beautiful art gallery of the Hunt
ington mansion on California street. Per
fect in appointment, soul-stirring in elo
quence and tantalizing of palate was this
the latest tribute of the president to his
trusted employes. And the host was
more than recompensed ' for his gastro
nomic courtesies. All that wit, all that
devotion ever gave was at his feet and
he was happy as a youth In summer
time.
In the very apple's eye of the center of
the table was the host and on either side
of him was Archmanipulator Herrin and
William Sproule. Herrin was master of
ceremonies, but Sproule was more than
that last night. He was the toastmaster,
and never was he in better form for scin
tillating, brilliant repartee. W. H. Mills
was not there â for good reasons. Paris
is the thing nowadays and Mills is watch
ing the company's interests in a far off.
land, so Sproule did the literary honors
and he did them well. All were happy â
jubilant. In fact â and the continuous
smile on Collis P. Huntington's face acted
as a wave of Joy which spread to the far
thermost ends of the long table.
J. C. Stubbs and Julius Kruttschnltt
were placed on the ends and they used a
well-skinned eye to control the fractious
cohorts. For ihe time being the hammer
orchestra was at rest. All was harmony
and peace on earth.
. From the blue point oysters to the
broiled plovers neither adulation nor im
patience were gtven full sway. After that
came the dozen or two of dessert and the
cafe nolr en demi tasse. That was the
signal for bursts of eloquence, and Herrin
unloosened the floodgates in a lofty in
troduction to the flow of reason that fol
lowed. No other than the host himself
started the toast ball rolling. His sub
ject was: "Past, Present and Future of
California."
A song by the combined company and
chorus, "For He's a Jolly Good Fellow,"
was the nightcap and the annual dinner
of 1900 passed into S. P. R. R. history.
About G000 words of printed manuscript
were reeled off the spindle by Huntlngton,
in which he damned the Nicaragua canal
most vehemently, shouted loud for expan
sion and went back to the golden days of
'49 to serve a moral and adorn a tale.
J. C. Stubbs was on hand with carefully
prepared wisdom on "Expansion The
ories." William Hood descanted on
"Legal Obstruction to Construction,"
G. E. Miles worked down to the personal
end of It by taliklng upon the "Personnel
of Our Active Workers." Foshay Walker
was set for a humorous speech on "After
dinner Endeavors." Then came C. H.
Morham of Portland, and he talked long
and ardently on the "Webfoot State." W.
V. Stafford, representing tfie conductors,
contributed his vocal efforts on "The
World We Move In," making a great hit
until F. G. Richardson let drive on "Cin
ders." which filled the eyes of all. E. O.
McCormlck was the wit at this stage of
the game. His subject was congenialâ
"Advertising Dodgers by a Dodger."
About this time it was getting late and
Collis P. showed signs of a visitation by
"death's beautiful brother." so Dr. Gard
k ner hurried his "Hospital Relief" treat-
Ve. A. D. Shepard spoke fast and furious
ly on "Asiatic Relations"; A. B. Ryan
worked oft a lot of "Reminiscences," and
G. W. Fletcher told of "The Man on the
Street."
