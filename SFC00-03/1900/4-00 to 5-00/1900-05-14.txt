The military * expert of the Lokal An

"If Cronje had loved his country half
as well as his country loved him he would
have marched right on to the point of a
British bayonet on that morning so dis
astrous to the Boer arms, and have yield
ed up his life in order that the memory
of his name might have remained as a
watchword on the lips and in the hearts
of his gallant yocman soldiery. When
he laid down his . arms he launched a
thunderbolt Into the Boer camp which
wrecked It forever." \
"But at last the truth became known.
Some who had escaped from Cronje's
laager brought In the fateful newp^and
then the stolid looking fighting men broke
down. They wept like boys. Great,
rugged, bearded men dashed their rifles
on the ground and spurned them with
their boots whilst down their sun and
wind tanned faces the tears poured stead
ily. Others took the news sadly with
chins dropping on their chests, with hard,
set faces, while with passionate pain too
deep . for words they stood lean
ing upon their rifles with hands
hard gripped until one would think
the tightened muscles would leave
the Impress of the straining fingers
upon the cold steel. The blow had stun
ned them. Had Paul Kruger betrayed
them to their foe3 for the sake of British
gold, they would not have felt the shock
as they felt this one man's surrender.
"When the news came the folks would
not believe it. They would just as soon
have believed that the sun could fall from
the heavens and leave the earth in dark
ness a? that Cronje, the iron-willed, tiger
hearted Cronje. could throw down his
arms. Had the news come that he had
maxle a mad rush at our guns and per
ished with all his men around him they
might have believed itâ believed It and

have sworn to avenge him. But they
would not. they could not and they did not
believe that he. the man in whom they
had placed their faith, had surrendered

from Durban, dated Sunday: "There are

LONDON. May 14. 4 a. in.â ""The war is
practically ov^r." says the Daily
Chronicle'* Kroonstad correspon
dent, and. In less definite terms,
this Is the view to be jrathered
from ' all the correspondents. They
Â¦picvtiTK the I2r*er* as utterly demoralized
and disheartened by Lord Roberts' unex
pectedly rapid advance and by his facile
turning of tho carefully prepared posi
tions of the Boers. There was practically
DO fighting and there are no further de
tail? to give respecting the occupation of
Kroonstad. The correspondent ' of the
Daily Telegraph pays:
"The union jack was hoisted In the
market place by Mrs. Ix>ckhead. the Am
erican wife of a Scotchman. Most of the
hcrsx-s of the Boers are in a wretched con
dition, but President Kruger declares he
Â¦will continue the war."
It appears tha-. the Boers at Kroonstad
had beer, reinforced by 3000 men from
Natal last Friday and that altogether 10,
000 with twenty guns trekked from Kroon
stad on the approach of Lord .Roberts. The
Boers made an Ineffectual stand at Bosch
rand and ha.d elaborate entrenchments In
front of Kroonstad. which offered great
facilities for a rear guard action. Their
only anxiety, however, appears to have
been to get away safely with all their
guns and convoys, which again they have
successful}* accomplished. The few
etores they were unable to carry away
they burned.
President Steyn is represented as hav
ing been frantic with rage and as having
kicked and cuffed the burghers after vain
ly iTnplorlng them to continue the fight.
;:,; Danger of Over-Confidence.
Lord Roberts, after a march which is
regarded as worthy of being ranked with
his famous march to Kandahar, has thus
covered another stage of his campaign, a
e^tape which although successful and with
out the mistakes and misfortunes that
characterized the earlier stages, leaves
tl-.^ Boer forces quite Intact, not having
lost a grun and. having lost very few men.
Experience has taught the critics to be
ch^ry of accepting reports of Boer de
moralization. The Times says:
"The signs point to military breakdown
on the part of the Boers, but, after ex
periences of the past, Â«ve cannot accept
the reports of demoralization without re
serve. The game of war must be strictly
played out to the end."

B4&Â± ROOXSTAD. Orange Free State, Saturday, May^j*. â The arrival of Lord Roberts was
rffiT~ hailed with enthusiasm by all the British inhabitants. Three hundred Free Staters were .
QS <BÂ£ anxious to surrender. The bridge to the south had not been destroyed, but the large bridge near
the toivn had been demolished. The Irish brigade zvith the Federals yesterday burned the
goods shed. According to the townspeople many of them were drunk.
The Boers are now trekking to the Vaal River, where they arc entrenching. 'General French en
camped northeast of the town and dispatched a force to cut the line. The project succeeded lale at '
night, but unfortunately after the departure of the last irain.
Although the troops had marched sixteen miles they were in excellent form on entering the toivn.
Many arrests have been made, chiefly of those zvho had maligned the British. It was found that many
persons hare been deported from Ladybrand for ultra sympathy with the British. President Steyn has.}
gone to Lindlcy, the new scat of Hit Free State Government. A numb:r of the burghers are trekking'
hamezvard. The opposition in the Free State is practically over. All the prisoners in the hands of the
British here agree that the quarrel betzveen the Free Staters and the Transvaalcrs is so acute that the
Tranvsalcrs have decided to leave their allies, whom they accuse of cowardice and lad of patriotism.
Most of the Transz'aal prisoners think that if they are defeated at the Vaal River the Boers will
retreat to Pretoria, but there appears to be a growing distrust in the Transvaal Government. In a word,
the backbone of the Boer resistance seems to have been broken. The burghers arc fighting without their
prei'ious stubbornness. They seem ready to retreat on the slightest pretext. The prisoners, even the
Transzaalers, appear glad to have been captured. They say they arc sick of a war which can have
only one end. Several have exclaimed, "We have lost our liberty, but why should we lose our lives?"

EMPORIA, Kan., May 13.â Hundreds of
men on foot, on horseback and in all

bers, James Murphy and E. V. Estell. who
last night added murder'to their crime by
killing Deputy Marshal Edward Roberta
of Dunlap, a member of a party that had
been pursuing the robbers for several
days.
On May 9 Murphy and Estell, It is al
leged, robbed a bank at Maryville, Kan.,
and since then a posse of deputies has
pursued the robbers, traveling a distance
of over 150 miles. About midnight last
night the robbers were " encountered acci
dentally in the dark by Roberts and a
companion who had become separated
from the pursuing party. Before they rec
ognized the robbers one of the latter had
emptied both barrels of his shotgun Into
Roberts, killing him instantly. Roberts
was but six feet from the robbers and the
shot tore a big hole in his chest. The
robbers again fled. Later they stole ex-
Mayor Sargent's horse and buggy and
started south.
Roberts was well known In Emporia and
the news of Ms tragic death caused great
excitement. Numerous posses were soon
fotmed and began scouring the country.
About 6 o'clock this evening the robbers
had been traced to within three miles of
Emporia. Lynching will surely follow

NEW YORK, May 13.â The World has
the following from Syracuse, N. Y.: Mrs."
Mary D. Grace, teacher in Tompkins
School, has received a telegram from her
*on in the City of Mexico apprising her of
ine fact that the -lower courts of Du
rango have executed the order of " the
Supreme (Jourt of Mexico affirming-, her
title to the Bismarck and Vacas mines in
the State of Durango, and, the son, Will
iam J. Grace, has been placed in charge
of the property. This is fortunate news
for Mrs. Grace, who for ten years has
fought to establish her title to the prop
erty, which is said to be worth anywhere
from $6,000,000 to $12,000,000. They are sil
ver-lead mines.
Net only does L|ra. Grace get possession
of the property, but she is also entitled to
a large judgment against the men who
have Illegally operated the mines for
many years. They, however, have some
rights in the property, which Mrs. Grace
or her agents will be held accountable for.
Young Grace telegraphs his mother that
he has had many olfers of a settlement. It
was thought by friends that either these
offers will be accepted or the property
sold to some big syndicate, as a great deal
of money should be put in to operate the
mines on a complete scale.
Mary D. Grace was for many years a
resident of San Francisco, where in 18S2
her husband, in company with other
Americans, became .interested in the Va
cass, San Marcos and Bismarck lead , and
silver mines In Durango. The mines had
lor centuries been successfully worked by
Spaniards and are at present estimated to
be worth about $20 ,000 ,000. ,A recent ex
ploration of the shafts and tunnels showed
about $12,000,000 In ore in sight.
About six years ago Mrs. Grace was de
prived of possession of the mines by rival
claimants, who went before a local Judge
and made affidavit that they were the true
owners and that .Mrs. Grace's son, Will
iam J. Grace, was in unlawful possession
of the property. The Judge thereupon or
dered out the rurale military police and
drove Grace and his associates out at the
point of the bayocet. Ever since then
Mrs. Grace has been teaching school and
saving all she could out of her slender sal
ary in order to provide means to keep up
the fight for her property In the Mexican
courts. ' Â¦'Â¦â¢ - " â¢ â¢ â¢:^ i <- -'Â¦

THE Comtesse de Martelle de Janyille, who startled "tout Parle" last Sat
urday with a circumstantial story that she had been kidnaped by three
bad men, is better known to the reading world as "Gyp," authoress of
a number of the lcadlnsr novels of the day. Is the grcat-grand-daughter
of the brother of the celebrated Mirabeau. She was born at the Chateau de
Koetsat in the Morblhan in 1S50, and in 1863 married the Comte de Martelle, who
in 1SS8, by official permission, added to his name that of his wife's family, de
Requeue de Mirabeau.
Her first sketches published In , "La vie Parisienne" were noted for "the
very delicate malice of their observations, their witty, risque tone and their
art of enclosing a moral in a tale that bordered very closely on the indeli
cate. Some of her types have been made proverbial, "Paulette" the luxur
ious woman of the world, "Petit Bob," and "London," the boy and girl of high
life, for instance. Her writings have always found ready acceptance with
the high-class magazines. One of her books "Autour du Marlage" was dra
matized by herself and M. H. Cremieux, but the play did not meet the same
success as the novel.
The Comtesse is in the habit of illustrating her own books, under the
pseudonym of "Petit Bob," in a. childlike and comic manner, that has taken
well. Besides those mentioned above, her principal works are "Pour ne pas
l'etre," "Passionette," "Cos Bons Normands" and "Le Mariage de Chiffon,
the last named being very popular.
The Brewery Workers' Union announced

A mass-meeting of strikers has been
called for to-morrow morning: at 10:30,
when it is believed determined action
will be decided upon. The meeting will be
presided over by National Organizer
Harry Bryan. . Bryan to-night expressed
his firm conviction that the. men would
ultimately win. and declared that the
fight would be forced from now on.
In addition to the resolutions of sympa
thy the Industrial Council unanimously
adopted an appeal to the Missouri mem
bers in Congress, setting forth the history
of the recent strike and urging the rep
resentatives, in the name of humanity, to
use their best endeavors to have Con
gress pass an act limiting the power of
Unites States Judges in issuing injunc
tions. In this connection there is also
favored the election of. United States
Judges by direct vote of the people. The
appeal was occasioned, of course, by
restraining order issued against the strik
ers last night by United States Judge
Hook. .
The Industrial Council is composed of
fifty-three different unions outside of the
building trades. Each of these unions
were represented at to-day's meeting by
two -delegates.
During the afternoon the Industrial
Council held an enthusiastic meeting and
adopted ; resolutions ,_ sympathizing with
the street-car men and ordering a boy
cott of the railway company. The reso
lutions request the heads of the differ
ent unions represented in the council to
instruct their members not to ride on
the cars and urge the members of these
unions working in the railway company's
power-house and shops, in whatever ca
pacity, to strike in sympathy with the
street-car men. The resolutions go as far
as to request the union musicians who
furnish music at the parks controlled by
the company to refuse to play for the
daily concerts.

! ptsiny that measure, has been filed in
I the House by the majority of the mem
j bers of the Democratic minority of the
I Committee on Merchants Marine and
Fisheries. Representative Fitzgerald of
Massachusetts drew the report, which
j was signed also by Representative de
! Vrie.Â« of California, Daly of New Jersey
! and Speight of Mississippi. Three other
i Democrats of the committeeâ Chandler,
' Small and Ransdvll â have heretofore sub
Â¦ mltted their views, upholding the general
! principle of Government aid to the mer
: chant marini|; but pointing out defects in
; the bill. The present report, therefore,
> represents the opposition to the measure
j both in principle and m detail. In. the
I main it is an argument against Govern
! ment subsidies, and assert j that most of
the proposed $!<,0yo,000 subsidy will go to a
few favored concerns without building up
American shipping in general or encour
! aging American exports.. The report
| quotes a recent utterance of President
I McKinley on the remarkable increase of
j our ship building and says in part:
I Our foreiKtj trade, then, is increasing 1 with
Â¦ wonderful rapidity and our shipbuilding in
dustry is remarkably pros]>*rou8 without sub-
I niil}\ Why then should the whole country be
i taxed to provide gratuities for industries which
i are now prosperous end which have every pros
i pec*; of continuing to be more and more pros
perous?
j Kven if our foreign commerce were in a de
clining rather than In a fairly prosperous con-
I dition it is Improbable that the present bill
| would give any relief, and for the followinc
' reason:
j because gubFidic? are graded according to the
[ speed "ami capacity of ships and are more than
I twice as high per ton of capacity for the swift
, paR5enj:er steamers, which carry but Httl<s
I carRo. as for ordlrjary freight steamers, which
I cmry *Â» to 90 per cent of our exports. The
, subsidy, therefore, if it affects lates at all,
i will affect passenger rather than freight rates.
Effect on Freight Rates.
I An only about 3 per cent of the total tonnage
of the world's shipping is subsidized, and as
| nearly all of the present subsidy Roes to pas
senger and mall steamers, the hopelessness of
trying by subsidy to lower freight rates and
increase commerce Is apparent. Unlimited Â»ub
. pidy would be necessary to lower general freight
j rates. If any one country attempts by subsidy
j to secure lower rates the subsidy must 50 to
all ships carrying freight*. Otherwise the
1 moment the few (subsidized ships lower rates
for one country l!i<! unsubsidized ships (tramp
steamers, etc.) will withdraw to other service
and rates for this iiaurticular country will go
back to the world's* level. HÂ«nce it is practi
cally beyond the ability of any. one country to
materially reduce by subsidy its ocean freieht
ratee and in this way to increase its foreign
trade.
It cannot be shown, from the history of sub
sidies, that they ever materially lowered freight
rates <>r increased the commerce of the coun
tries granting them. Trade conditions, and
not trade theories, fix the rates which shippers
will i-ay and which shipowners can tret. Neither
does the .history of subsidies show' that any
country has ever built up its merchant marine
in this way. Our experience with the Collins
Brazil and Pacific Mail lines is the present ex
perifence of France and Italy and past experi
ence, of all other countries which have civen
Â¦real subsidies. .
As the Government could not under the pro
posed law take American" f hips for cruisers or
transports on any more favorable terms than' it
can now obtain them, x-iz.. by paying for them
ail they are w/irth. it will on this -score get
nothing In return fdr its lavish subsidy expen
ditures. Neither is there anything in the hit
whkh would provide American seamen for our
national defense. In no way then would this
bill provide for the national delense. On the
oontraiy, by draining $sÂ».Â«Xj,000 a year from our
national treasury, it weakens our national de
fense by t.ikinvr money which might otherwise
be invested in more ships or in transports,
provision, ammunition, etc.. In case of war.
Ship-Building Trust Feared.
Such a large amount of subsidy practically
put at the disposal of the few who benefit by
this bill canni>t but tend to unite, even more
closely than now, the great ship-building, shlp
ownlngr and railroad interests concerned in this
measure. By the time these few interests bring
in their foreign-owned ships and get their ship*
now being built Into the subsidy race the J9.O0O.
000 limit will undoubtedly be reached. Hence.
It will be to their Interest to combine to stop
competition and to prevent their subsidy rates
and Droflts from lic-clinins. W* 1 believe that
euch a combination would be completed soon
after the passage ot this bill.
We ulace no faith in the anti-trust amend
m*>nt. All the- Feder*i and State anti-trust laws
now in existence havt proven futile and hav'e
not lessened the rap'ti growth of trusts. We
*ee no reason for think*"; that this anti-trust
amendment wculd prove more effective.
By this bill, which nrofesses to be Intended
Uuce the Government is asked to pav to the
stockholders of a single ship line Jl,*500,000 a
year for carrying abroad in Its four tlrst-clai's
passenger ships, not American uroducts but
American tourists who can afford to travel and
spend their money in Europe. That Is, the
Oovernment is asked to pay. not for the ex
portation of American produce, but for the ex
portation cf American customers.
The report contends that even if sub
sidies are justifiable in building up an en
terprise, such as the Pacific roads, yet
there Is no justification for "a reward to
existing lines."
In conclusion, the objections are sum
med up as follows:
1. The objection professed In the title are
entirely forjrotten in the body of the bill.
2. It is reasonably certain that the most of
the subsidy would go to lines already estab
lished and prosperous.
3. Under this bill the ordinary freight Rteam
ers. which carry SO or 00 per cent of our agri
cultural exports, will get but a fraction of the
amount ot subsidy which the passenger steam
ers would receive, although the latter carry less
than 10 per cent of our agricultural exports.
; 4. Under this bill a Khlp can run practically
: in ballpst and draw subsidy. We believe that
; when freight Is not promptly offered It will pay
than to wait for cargo.
5. Tr.l* bill cocld tp.x all our citizens to pro
vide extra profit for a favored few in this fa
vored industry.
6. The professions of this bill are insincere
and its principles are unsound. We |>elieve
that the best Interests of this nation do not de
mand the passage of this or of any similar bilL

OBJECTIONS TO
THE SNIPPING
SUBSIDY BILL
Buencarnino's reputation, gained in for
mer wars, is that of a man who hurries
to get on the winning side. He was* in
diffavor with the Filipinos, even before
the collapse of their Government, owing
to a widespread suspicion of dislovalty
to his oolloasrues.
Last week General Ma c Arthur- received
a larpe number of officialsâ Consuls, offi
cers and representatives of commercial
bodies. To Lieutenant Colonel Crowder,
his military secretary, he will assijjn
many duties heretofore devolving upon
The Adjutant-General. This step is taken
in view of the Increasing importance of
the post of Governor General. Mac-
Arthur 1 ? policy appears to involve con-
Fiderable dfoentralization. He will give

and will devote himself to questions of

A paper found among the captured ef
fects of General Pantalon Garcia asserts
that the United States Congress has done
nothing for the Filipinos, and that, there
fore, all Filipinos who are. working for
Americans must leave their employers
Immediately or suffer the penalty of trea
son.
One report i* that the Filipino Junta is
endeavoring to Incite an outbreak in order
to show the Civil Commission thdl the in

It does not seem probable that the peace

the landing of the Americans and sus

three casualties.
The latest rumor of an outbreak in
Manila among the natives, which' was in
circulation last week, was seriously dis
cussed by some of the local papers and
attracted more general attention than has
uj-caliy been the case with this sort of
thing. As a matter of fact, many Fili
pinos did leave their American employers
vith the apparent intention of joining
wme such movement. Their action, taken
in connection with the arrest of several
natives for carrying concealed weapons
and the dispersion of several suspicious
gatherings, gave color to the report.

PARIS. May 14.â The second ballots In
the municipal election in Paris yesterday
(Sunday) In the districts left without
definite results on May 6 have given the
Nationalists twenty out of thirty seats.
This result fully Justifies them in claim
ing a great local victory,- inasmuch as
seventeen out of the twenty seats are
direct gains from the Ministerial Social
ists, t
With the districts they carried on May
6 the Nationalists will now control twen
ty-eight new members in the new Muni
cipal Council. This gives them a sweep
ing majority. Thus the Waldeck-Rous
seau Cabinet has suffered a severe re
buke in .Paris, and the outcome Is sure
to be exceedingly interesting. The Paris
Municipal Council has always been a.
truculent body, but with the Council pull
ing one* way and the Government another,
stirring times are probably in store for
Parisians.
Thoughout the day great animation pre
vailed in the arrondissements where the
polling- took place. Intense excitement
prevailed during the evening on Boule
vard Montmartre, where a crowd of a
thousand collected in front of the bureau
of the Nationalist and anti-Jewish organ,
La. Libre Parole, to learn the results.
These were shown on an illuminated
transparency. Between the announcement
of results portraits of Paul Deroulede
and of anti-Nationalists were thrown on
the screen. The portrait of Deroulede
was greeted with frantic cheering, but the
others brought forth loud hooting and
hissing. Finally the proceedings became
so uproarious that strong detachments of
police were compelled to clear the neigh
borhood and the adjacent streets were
cordoned. This measure led to several
conflicts between the crowd and the po
lice, but there were no serious disorders
At a late hour Nationalist youths pa
raded the streets cheering and shouting
"Vive Deroulede," "Vive l'Armee" and
"A bas les Juifs."
Eighteen arrests wero made on the
boulevards. In the provinces calm was
maintained, except at Marseilles, where
bands of anarchists paraded the town and
broke into the printing office of the
Soleil du Midi. Free fights took place at
many points in Marseilles and revolvers
were fired.

stone fort on the bluff above it.
"Immediately upon landing the town was
surrounded, and upon the appearance Â«;f
the chiefs they wero told to order all the
inhabitants ashore unarmed and assemble
them below the fort. This is a densely
popalated village, and more than two
hundred men were finally assembled, one
man being shot while attempting to es
cape.
Vengeance of the Soldiers.
"On being questioned, the chiefs and men
assembled expressed absolute Ignorance
of the affair and the men concernetPin it,
and I sent them back to their houses with
the information that if In the morninc at
8 o'clock they could give me no informa
tion the town would be burned. Durin"
the afternoon I had arrested eleven men
on suspicion and they were confined in
the fort, where we passed the night, with
proper guards over the boats and the
town.
"During the night I examined the pris
oners and finally two of them confessed
knowledge of the matter and gave me a
list of eight names and, of course, I knew
that the traitors were the other two. I
verified many of the subsidiary details
from the other prisoners. In the town
there was a big talk all night with my
friendly Moros to help matters along, and
next morning word was sent that they
had three of the murderers to turn orer.
This was done, and the talking was fast
and furious. All the accused told about
each other; told where the other five men
were working, and told where the guns
were buried. The chiefs and Moros
stronsrly advised against sending soldiers
Into the woods for the ftve. as the mur
derers would surely see them first and
escape in the deep forest. So a party of
villagers and my Bonogoa Moros went out
and got them about six miles away. They
all told the story of the murder and the
share each man took in it to the minut
est detail.', their reasons for it, etc.
"One of the murderers was then sent
with a party to get some weapons, and the
other nine were -Â«ent with a, guard to get
wood and water for cooking purposes. In
a short time I heard some firing. I sent
a detail to Investigate tbJg. and they re
turned with the news that soon after
leaving the fort the prisoners had mada
an Ill-advised attempt to escape, but for
tunately alt had been killed. I sent thÂ«
hospital steward, who had accompanied
the expedition, to treat the wounded it
any, but they were all dead when hÂ»
reached the spot. Soon afterward the
other party of soldiers and Moroa re
turned with the news that the murderer
in their charge had also been killed wall*
attempting to escape."
Captain Cloman concludes his report
'with a high tribute to the men who com
posed the hunting party and praise for
the natives who assisted him in appre
hending the murderers.

tives or their Intentions were unknown
and the night was very dark. Soon after
going in ca nip the plug had been pulled
from the bottom of the boat, and , she
was allowed to fill - with water for the
purpose ot cleaning her, and she had to
be balled out. The dead sergeant and
Private Gibbons had to be carried through
the woods to the boat ..and they wero
more than thirty miles frem friends or
help with one man Â¦ to sail . the boat and
take care of .the three wounded. '
They reached this port at 8 o'clock the
next morning. ' â , _
"The two dead men, "continues Captain
Cloman's report.i '.'were buried that after

Gibbons' Awful Death.
By Sunday morning the party had ar
rived at the town of Bilimblng, on an isl
and of the same name, some three miles
from Tawl-Tawl, and were hospitably en
tertained. None of their â¢ chiefs being
present, however, toward night the men
camped on a small uninhabited island
eight miles from Bilimblng. -Before dark
"they noticed two large proas, or native
boats, about a mile off shore. Next morn
ing tea natives landed and came to the
camp.
Later, followed by the two praus. the
BOldiers proceeded on 'to Tawl-Tawl, land
ed and pitched camp near the beach. The
natives soon joined and assisted them in
their work. About 6 p. m. Corporal My
eatt undressed and. leaving the other four
men playing whist In the middle of the
tent with the natives clustered around
looking on, went down to the beach to
bathe The natives had no weapons vis
ible but as It turned out. each one had a
hatchet or a small bolo. used for cutting
after reaching the beach Mygatt
heard screaming and then two shots, and
at once started back for the camp.
In the tent the game had continued for
about five minutes after the corporal s
departure, when the native standing be
hind Sergeant de Wolfe suddenly pulled
a parang from behind him and struck
the sergeant on the neck, nearly severing
the head from the body and killing him
at once. At almost the same time Pri
vate Gibbons was struck on the side of
the neck and head, making a hole through
the skull five inches long, through which
the brain oozed, and Private Greathouse
was struck on the neck, the parang sev
ering the external carotid artery and ex
posing the internal artery and spine. The
parang (which I now have) is badly nick
ed and dulled, or the head would have
been completely severed. The edge of the
parang meant for Private Carter's neck
was turned by the tent canvas, and only
staggered him. but at almost the same
time another Moro struck him a terrible
blow on the head with the oar he had
made. Ho staggered toward his gun,
but another native sunk a hatchet deep
into his back, injuring his spine. He then
ran to the cook fire, about twenty yards
distant for the ax. but by^the time he
h^d reached it and turned the Moros had
all disappeared but the three who were
chopping Private Gibbons, and these ran
before he could reach them.
Treachery of the Natives.
Several parties of soldiers had previous
ly visited and hunted over the lower part
of the island and In every case had ex
perienced very friendly treatment at the
hands of the natives, many of whom had
visited the post at Bongao in return.
Captain Cloman's report gives a very
full account of the affair, except the de
tails of the killing, which are supplied
from Mygatt's letters. The report, from
which some extracts are given below, is
dated Bongao, Philippine Islands, Febru
ary. 2, 1900. and says that on January 25 a
party consisting of Sergeant Kgbert V. de
Wolfe, Corporal Leonard J. Mygatt, Pri
vates Webster F. Gibbons, William T.
Carter and John A. Greathouse, all of
Company HV Twenty-third Infantry, left
the post on a seven days* leave in a small
sailboat for the purpose ,of visiting the
lake on Tawl-Tawl and hunting.
Instantly his Krag-Jorgensen, filled with
bullets, began belching them Into the
crowd of unarmed natives. He had filled
the magazine of his rilh with cartridges
filed at the end so they would split and
spread upon striking the body. At the
first crack of this soldier's gun the rlfle3
of twenty-nine other men In the detail
began to speak, and, acording to Mygatt's
narrative, not one of the Filipinos was
left alive.
"You deserve It," was the answer.
The letter described how thirty Ameri
can soldiers with loaded rifles formed the
detail that carried the prisoners out to
"work." The prisoners were taken to a
place where wood was already cut. There
they were_ huddled together. One of the
soldiers sprang forward and shouted:
"I claim the first shot."
According to Mygatt, the captain's order,
was: "Take them out to work. We need
wood for our fire. Do not let them es
cape."

Many Fearless and Able Champions of
the People 'Are Chosen to: Repre
sent the Rarty at Sacramento,
THE Republican State Convention
called for the purpose of electing
four delegates at large to represent
California in the national convention
at Philadelphia vrill meet In Sacramento
at 2 o'clock to-morrow afternoon. Dis
trict conventions will also meet for the
purpose of choosing delegates to repre
sent the several Congressional districts in
tlfce national council- The California dele
caxion, will consist of eighteen membersâ
tour at large and two from each Congres-
Elcmai district.
According to the provision* of the call
Issued by the Republican State Central
Ccouduee tee titate convention must
elect a new committee to manage the af-
Xairs cf the party. The duty of appoint
ing an executive committee to assist the
central organization in the management
of the Presidential campaign may be del
egated to the chairman of the convention,
bence It 1b essential that a man of the
highest character should be chosen chair
man.
TfcÂ« Call has no candidate for chairman
ci the convention. It wants the man
selected whose leadership will win victory.
It desires a chairman who will not accept
a programme or take orders from any in
dividual or corporation. This Journal has
opinions to express and does not hesitate
to give expression to them. It is the
opinion of The Call that the Republicans
will make a mistake it they adopt a na
tional platform in State Convention. The
duty of proclaiming the position of the
party on national questions should be
left to the convention at Philadelphia.
Four years ago the Republican State
Convention which assembled at Sacra
rr.e.-.to adopted a national platform, and
the result was party embarrassment in
California throughout the subsequent
campaign. The error committed then
should not be repeated now. The Call de
tlree Republican success and will stand
t>y thÂ« principles which the representa
rix-es of the party in national convention
proclaim.
The Republicans of California have not
authorized any clique, corporation or ln
oividual to present a programme to the
6=tate convention. A programme Is not
required. Delegates can exchange views
ts to proper plans of organization when
the time comes for the convention to or-
Faniie. It is an easy matter for the
sjirolt politician to secure the announce
ment in the Democratic press and rail
road organs that everything has been pre
crrar.jred. The bluff may mislead some of
the dfelefrates and cause them to Join In
â¢with the supposed majority arrangement.
The politician who groes to Sacramento
â¢trtiisperlns "This Is the programme, and
you had barter etand In, ehould bÂ« in-
Ftantly called down. TheRepublicana who
favor harmor.y and party triumphâ the
men who are Republicans in season and
out of f<ason, m^n who are Republicans
from principle and not for office â have no
programme to present.
It will be observed from a reading of

REPUBLICAN DELEGATES
TO STATE CONVENTION
INDIANAPOLIS, May 13.â Hugo Miller
to-day announced that by a referendum
vote of 1313 to 931 Social Democrats have
defeated the proposed amalgamation with
the so-called "kangaroo" branch of the
Social Labor party, and that this result
,will force Job Harriman off the Socialist
Democratic ticket Jfor Vice President. In
January, in Rochester. X. Y., Harriman
Â¦was nominated for President. He now
lives In California. His running mate was
Max Hays of Cleveland, Ohio. At the
convention of the Social Democrats held
In Indianapolis two months ago Eugene
V. Debs was nominated for President and
Harriman made his running mate. The
nomination had to be approved by a ref
erendum vote, and this vote carried with
It not only the acceptance of Harriman
as a candidate, but an amalgamation of
the Social Democrats and the "kanga
roos."
Off Their Ticket.
Social Democrats Force Job Harriman
MAY NOT BUN.
The opinion is quite common that the latter
plan prevailed after all. and that It is under
stood that Towne's nomination was simply a
compromise. It was stated by many of the
delegates, though never in open convention,
that Towne will get out of the way If the other
two conventions do not indorse him. It was
freely and openly stated, however, by Bryan
leaders, both before and after Towne's nom
ination, that the Democrats at Kansas City
will never Indorse him. And some of the
Bryan lieutenants based their opposition to
his nomination ution the assertion that bÂ« is
too rood a man to be sacrificed to the Vice
Presidency.
Thirdâ Nominate some man who will with
draw from the Populist ticket If the Kansas
City Convention declines to indorse him.
Firstâ Refer the nomination of Vice Presi
dent to a committee for conference with simi
lar committees from the Democratic and Sil
ver Republican conventions, with power to ap-
I-olnl.
Secondâ Select several names for submission
to the Democrats and Sliver Republicans and
add "or some other person equally committed
to reform principles."
The men who were recognized as the Bryan
lieutenants In the Sioux Kails gathering were
outspoken in declaring their convictions that
Towne's nomination will not be Indorsed at
Kansas City. That was before the nomination
was made and while they were laboring to pre
vent It In compliance with the plans mapped
out by Mr. Bryan. The delegates who were In
formed of the wishes of Mr. Bryan, In order
that they might carry the greatest possible
weight, had taken the precaution to secure
them in Bryan's own handwriting. The writ
ten slips laid down Mr. Bryan's Ideas of what
tt would be best for the convention to do In
the form of three distinct plans preferred In
this order: /
OMAHA, May 13.â Returned delegates to
the Sioux Falls convention do not hesi
tate to discuss the inside workings of the
Populist steering committee. Some of
them are talking too much, perhaps. As is
well known, the Nebraska delegation split
on the question of nominating: a candidate
for second place, and hence one faction is
sore at the action of the other. The
Omaha Bee will say editorially:

The Presidential campaign opens very coolly, but
there is plenty' of time for it to get red hot before it
Tcrnntius Donnelly has been nominated for Vice
President by one wing of the Populists. Ignatius
will need all the craft displayed in his Shakespearean
freak to locate himself after the votes arc counted in
Jiovember.
The modern iconoclast has reverence not even for
the name of Thomas Jefferson. The chairman of the
fusion Populist convention says that Jeffersonian
Democracy is Populism. The gentleman ought to
be urged to smoke another brand.
From the reports of the cordiality of the popular
reception given to Dc-acv along the route of his tour
through the Mississippi Valley, the average American
citi7en thinks just as much of him and his wife as if
neither of them had ever had an aspiration for the
Presidency.
Neither the athletes themselves nor their friends,
however, will make of the accidents an excuse for
I failure. In fact our champions need seek for no ex
cuses. They have done well against* some of the
strongest teams the great universities of the Eait
I could bring against them. It is to be borne in mind
I that the spring season in the East is trying eventipon
j those who are native to it. The Californians Â¦ were
j not acclimated and, of course, felt the effects of the
'; weather. "Furthermore we have not as yet had ; in
'California the thorough training which the Eastern
' students undergo, nor has there been here the same
I degree of stimulus to athletic exercises which -East-
OUR athletes of the University of California
have had bad luck in the contests with the
teams of Eastern universities and something 1
! of their failure to win the triumphsWr hopes expected
is attributable to accident. We have therefore reason
for a continuance of hope for success in future con
tests, for in the next matches the. handicap of bad
1 luck may be on the other side.

, The agitation for the expansion of the
German navy has brought to public at
tention the fact that the clamor for more
ships Is largely due to the individual bene
fits Which certain steel manufacturers
would derive from the couple of hundred
million dollars' expenditures. German

The British Admiralty has at last made
some slight concessions to the Engineer
Corps of the navy. The engineer In chief
will have the relative rank of rear ad
miral; chief inspectors of machinery have
been increased from five to eight and in
spectors of machinery from eight to thir
teen. The grade of staff engineer has been
abolished: chief engineers are to rank
with lieutenants of and above eight years
seniority; there is also a slight Increase
in pay, and the allowances to senior engi
neers on board ships have been ralsÂ«d
from 23 cents a day to 62 cents.
The British ironclad Belleisle, rated tn
Brassel's Naval Annual of 1899 as fit for
active service, has been condemned and
is to be used as a target for the channel
squadron. The Belle isle was purchased in
1878 for $1,200,000 and has never been con
sidered an efficient vessel. Her side ar
mor is twelve inches, not thick enough
to offer any considerable resistance to a
modern high-power rifle of 6-lnch caliber.

also being constructed at the Barrow

ARMY INTELLIGENCE.
It is to be borne in mind that while an early ad-;
jourhment will leave much undone that was expected,
nevertheless a great deal of work has been accom
plished. . The act which establishes the gold standard
and reforms our currency and banking laws is one
of the I most important acts of legislation since the
war and in itself will be sufficient to confer distinction'
upon this Congress. Then there has ' been legislation
affecting Hawaii and Porto Rico of great importance
which opens up a new field of activity; for our Gov
ernment. Thus enough has been achieved to consti
tute a good record for the session, and if now the
members of Congress determine to close up and re
turn home about the . time Presidential conventions'
are held nobody will blame them. It has been a good
Congress, but there is no desire on the part of the
people to have it ' at work all summer.
The Nicaragua Canal bill is another of the import
ant measures which were expected of this -session,
but the opponents of the canal by making a fight
against the Hay-Pauncefote treaty have virtually
forced a postponement of action upon that subject.
Other great issues have been so far involved with par
tisan questions that to bring them forward on the eve
of a Presidential election would result in a partisan
wrangle, and probably little of good could be obtained
by an attempt to force action upon them.
Should the reported policy be carried out there will
be, of course, some disappointment, but we believe
the people on the whole will not be dissatisfied. It
is now clear that the great expectations with which
the assembling of Congress was attended cannot be
realized and the fault has not been that of Congress
itself. For example it was believed last summer that
Â¦when Congress assembled we should have a, definite
settlement of the Philippine question. The. President
himself suggested as much in his speech at Boston
when he said that the nation's policy toward its new
possessions would have to be determined by the wis
dom of Congress. Events in the islands, however,
have prevented the adoption of a permanent policy at
this time and until the situation there is more fully
understood it would not be wise to undertake to for
mulate such a policy. Moreover until the Supreme
Court has pronounced judgment upon 'the constitu
tionality of the legislation for Porto Rico it is better
to wait before legislating for the Philippines.
0N EARLY ADJOURNMENT.
REPORTS from Washington are to the effect
that the leaders in both the Senate and the
House are desirous of bringing the present ses
sion to a close before the end of June. For that rea
son many important measures which it was expected
would be dealt with at this session will probably be
postponed.
Stockton Independent.
The San Francisco Call published a car
toon yesterday by Artist Warren that
struck home. It was labeled, "Our ex
hibit at Paris Exposition." Its chief feat
ure was the California Commission In re
galia and uniform* and armed with
swords, obscuring with their gigantic
pride and affected Importance the mini
ature display of squashes and other pro
ducts. In the foreground were a few
pigmy observers inspecting the spurs,
swords and â¢ epaulets of the great Com
missioners. It was a happy hit. It ta
to be hoped that all Stockton visitors to
the exposition will try and get a view of
California's exhibit in all their salaried
glory.
THE CAIX'S HA*PY HIT.
The evil is more irritating at this time because the
work is now so far advanced that a little energy on
the part of those in authority could soon complete it.
That energy, however, is frittered away in genera!
fussiness in other directions. The Mayor tinkers here
and tinkers there, to show his power through a mere
vanity, but nothing is done of benefit to the com
munity. Thus the Hall of Justice is left unfinished,
the streets are unswept, unsprinkled and unlighted:
Robbery goes on by night and jobbery by day and
the Phelan administration will be long remembered
for "ways that are dark and for tricks that are vain."
The Hall of Justice, designed as a permanent im
provement, has under the Phelan regime taken a form
that threatens a permanent scandal â a permanence at
any rate which will be as lasting as the Phelan govern
ment. Years have passed since the work on the build
ing began. The traffic of the vicinity has been seri
ously interfered with during all that time and prop
erty-owners have suffered a loss in the rental value
of their property. Most * of the loss has been due
solely to a lack of energy on the part of the municipal
government, and the Mayor, who has frequently
boasted that he is the government, is, of course, re
sponsible for the wrong.
Phclan's ante-election pledges have proven to be
less reliable than the proverbial pie crust, for even
when broken the crust shows something of substance,
while the Phelan phrases have vanished into empty
air. Instead of improvements commensurate with the
growing wealth and population of the city we have
had a retrograde policy which has carried the munici
pal administration back to the primitive days of Yerba
Buena, when street-cleaning was left to the public
spirit of the individual citizen, and he who went out
at night either carried a lantern or waited for the
moon and in cither case went armed.
Â¦ â¢
DELAY in the work of completing the Hall of
Justice adds one more to the many irrita
tions of the Phelan fiasco government. The
Mission clubs complain of a lack of permanent im
provements, the Merchants' Association is compelled
to perform the task of street-cleaning, the fraternal
societies protest' against the darkness which renders
the streets dangerous at night, and now the business
men in the vicinity of the Hall of Justice have to re
new their complaints against that exasperating job
bery, which for so long a time has made the construc
tion of the building a public scandal.
THE HflLL OF JUSTICE JOB.
Recent rains throughout California have somewhat
ch?nged local conditions during the past week. The
rainfall was unusually heavy in the San Joaquin Val
ley, from one and a half to two inches falling in one
day alone. Some hay was caught, some fruit spoiled,
some languishing crops given a fine revigoration,
some saved altogether and so on. Some districts
were damaged, others benefited. On the whole the
benefits largely exceeded the damage. The business
of the port of San Francisco continues brisk and
while not as lively as last year, when the soldiers were
here by the thousands and the Government was buy
ing immense quantities of clothing and provisions for
the Philippines, it is still active enough to keep times
good. The decline in wheat is the only unfavorable
feature in California at the moment, but wheat is not
the only staple of the Stale, as it was a few years ago,
fo it brings no disaster in its train as in former years.
Otherwise the markets show nothing new of interest.
Wall street still sleeps. Trading is almost wholly
confined to the professionals, as the public still holds
aloof. Money is easy enough, there are no threaten
ing Elgin in the financial sky, Europe is borrowing
our cold in blocks, yet the public refuse to take the
bait. The fact is, nobody wants to speculate for some
reason or other.
Dullness is the feature of the leading staples at the
moment Iron and steel buyers are holding off and
purchase only to fill immediate wants. Stocks showed
a slight gain in April, while several descriptions weak
ened oft slightly again last week. The unsettled con
dition of the building trades in the matter of labor
troubles is proving a detriment to the iron, steel and
lumber trades, not *o mention the dozen other lines
directly dependent upon the building of house9.
Lumber shows the effects of the strikes in lower quo
tations here and there. Wool has declined again and
the demand is reported slack everywhere. Prints are
offering under previous quotations. Hides and
leather continue dull and weak, as the boot and shoe
manufacturers are holding back on account of the
high price of leather and hides are consequently ac
cumulating at the principal markets. Wheat has
again declined and the market has looked very soft
and discouraging for several days. The Government
report, issued Friday, was bearish, as indicating a
large winter crop in spite of the damage done by un
seasonable weather in midwinter, though the ship
ments of wheat and flour from Atlantic ports were
larger than for the same week in 1899.
The best business reports are received from the Pa
cific Coast, particularly California, and a fair retail
trade is reported from different parts of the country,
but the manufacturers complain that orders from
wholesalers and jobbers are not what they ought to
be. A good many mills and factories are still run
ning on orders received away back in 1899, but new
orders are coming in very slowly, or not at all.
THE improvement in business remarked during
the first week of the month did not last long,
for last week was dull again, with a slack de
mand for goods and a weaker tendency in prices. The
bank clearings of the country fell off 18 per cent, as
compared with the same week in 1899, New York
fchowing a decrease of 26.4 per cent and Boston 18.2,
while the failures were 174, against 169 for the corre
sponding week last year.
ANOTHER DULL SEASON.
AVe are loth to believe that either Colonel Burns or the railroad company had
anything to do with this matter, but would rather think tt to be the overzealous
action of volunteers seeking to curry favor. Events will soon show, however,
the true inwardness of the situation, but at the present writing it is certain that
a premeditated and persistent effort was made to prevent General Dickinson's
election as a delegate to the State convention, and all because he did not vote
for Colonel Burns for United States Senator.
We shall await future developments with great Interest In view of the present
situation. -:"'â¢/ i* : *'r'f:
The action of Senator Dickinson and Assemblyman Atherton in refusing to
vote for Colonel Burns has always been and is fully- Indorsed by this county, and
It is strange that It should now be used against either by any one; and it would
appear that the action at the last primaries as set forth in this article was taken
by a few with the hope of securing the appointment of one or more of their num
ber to some position in the near future; but we venture to say that they will not
succeed.
We were very much surprised to learn at San Rafael on Saturday last at the
meeting of the county convention that certain friends or pretended friends of
Colonel Burns and the Southern Pacific Company had engineered the primaries
with a view of defeating General Dickinson as a delegate to the convention to
meet at Sacramento. Seeing that he was not and never had been a. candidate
the flpht against him was of the order which attacks windmills. The delegates
from Mill Valley, Bolinas, Tlburon and Belvedere were arranged for to vote
against him, and this by the "old guard," and. this again because the general
did not vote for Colonel Burns for United States Senator. TVe are not particular
ly Interested In the general and he can probably take care of himself, politi
cally- a3 well as otherwise, but there should be fair play and some of the dele
gates present may be pleased to learn the true reason, of the opposition to him.
As he was not a candidate the situation was a trifle ludicrous, and it loses noth
ing of its humor that Assemblyman Atherton also failed to vote for Colonel Burna
and yet his relations with the "old guard" would suggest that if their friendship
.for Colonel Burns and the railroad company Is genuine â tnat they are only in
terested in promoting our best Interests and that the county favored Colonel
Burns' electionâ they, should have had Mr. Atherton cast his vote for Colonel
Burns. ..'

BURNS AND THE S. P. R. R.
IN POLITICS IN MARIN
occasionally brought Krupp prices down,
as for example when the latter made &
tender for a number of field gun barrels
at 91200 apiece and when a competitor of
fered to deliver the articles at W37 50
Krupp reduced his offer to $473. On an
other occasion his bid of $2 12Vi for shells
was subsequently reduced to $1 25 through
competition. Krupp Is the owner of the
only gun-proving grounds In Germany, for
which he charges the Government a fabu
lous rental. Imperial Germany appears to
be worse off In the matter of monopolies
than republican America, for even the
Emperor himself holds considerable stock
In a shlp-bulldlng yard, which latter, ot
course, is largely employed on Govern
ment contracts.
The defect of Washington. is that its population is
made up mainly of people who take no part in the
activities of American life. It is filled with office
seekers who could not get elected to anything and
who content themselves with Government clerkships.
It has no citizens of leadership capable of organizing
a great commercial enterprise or directing a local
government. The community is American in name
only. It dislikes the hustle and the jostle of repub
lican institutions. It suits the official class there to
draw salaries from the national- treasury, spend them
in imitating the manners of foreign embassadors, leav
ing business and politics to the rest of the country. It
would benefit the District of Columbia to have self
government imposed upon it and it is to be hoped
Champ Clark's bill Avill be tried.
It is frequently said that the objection of the people
of Washington to undertaking self-government is that
the negro vote in the District of Columbia is so cor
rupt that it renders good government impossible.
The statement, however, is not to be accepted as a
full explanation of the situation.' Throughout the
Southern States there is in all the principal cities a
negro vote larger in proportion than that in Wash
ington and yet the people of those cities carry on local
governments, with as high a degree of honesty and
efficiency as those of "the North. Moreover it is not
true that the negro vote. is as corrupt as the Wash
ington people assert. It has never been noted in
other large cities thnt the colored vote is any worse
than the white vote or that it tends to make popular
government impossible.
A report concerning the manner in which the sub
ject is regarded in Washington says*: "An indication
oJ local feeling was made a few nights Bftp. At a
meeting of the Columbia Heights Citizens' Associa
tion resolutions for and againut the Champ Clarl:
proposition were introduced and tliitcussctl. The
negative resolution expressed the opinion that uni
versal suffrage 'is deemed highly undesirable to the
best interests' nnd the members of the nssociation
were asked to prevent the passage b( the bill. After
much talk the advocates of suffrage and those opposed
to it came to a vote and the friend* of local self-gov
ernment were beaten 9 to 1, the. vote being 36 to 4.
This would be the result in other sections of the city
if the negroes were not permitted to take part in the
deliberations or to vote."
A short time ago Chump ClarW of Missouri, think
ing to do the people of Washington a good turn, in
troduced into the Hcusc of Representative* n bill
to restore local self-government to; thÂ« District of
Columbia. That, of course, involved the restoration
of the right of suffrage, which wag taken from the
people of the District when tho present form of gov
ernment was established. The effotu of the Mis
sourian, however, have not been received with the
gratitude he expected. The Waihlngtontani nrc
afraid of themselves, they are ;ifrai<t of otic another,
they vlare not miÂ»i their own vote, They prefer to
be governed by Congress and take elninm.
I JASHINGTON city has the double distinction
VA/ of being the capital of the greatest and
freest republic on earth and the only large city
in the civilized world which \\m no degree of self
government and no desire for any, It is t\ community
isolated from ihc rest of the nation, having little or
no connection with the great movements of politics or
commerce and none of our popular aipirntioni.

The University of California has now proven a
worthy competitor on the athletic field with the great

During the four years which have followed the last
election there has been no interruption- of progress,
no setback to enterprise. The country has gone
steadily forward upon the paths of prosperity and
popular happiness. Now com* the election year
which gives the demagogues and the agitators a
chance to check that progress if they can. The plat
forms of the two parties will show the motives that
animate them and the people will have a plain choice
to make between- the party that rejoices and is proud
and that which mourns, decries and repudiates.
This contrast between the attitude of the two parties
toward the issues of the time is bound to have a
strong effect upon the minds of independent voters.
There are certain natural born Democrats who would
vote the party ticket even if the party platform de
nounced Democracy itself. Those, however, who vote
for the welfare of the country and for their own in
terests will have no hesitation in their minds this year.
The business affairs of all are involved in the contest.
We have had four years of protection and sound
money and to-day the prosperity of the people of the
United States is more general, more abundant and qf
a higher level than has ever been known by any peo
ple before in the history of the world. It is a pros
perity firmly based upon the natural order, of things
and will continue unless the people should place in
power a set of officials pledged to undertake by legis
lation to interfere with nature and to disorder our
finances and our industries for the purpose of giving
the discontented a chsnee to get even with the in
dustrious and the thrifty.
The Republican party will indorse the administra
tion, rejoice in the prosperity that has been brought
about by its governmental p.olicies, glory in the
triumphs achieved both at home and abroad, express
pride in the prestige the nation has attained as a
world power white augmenting the welfare of its peo
ple, will heartily support the administration that has
been instrumental in achieving these great benefits,
will entrust to the hands of the President the manage
ment of public affairs for another term and will com
mend him for his patriotism and his statesmanship in
the past. Democracy will repudiate everything in
sipht, mourn over all that has been done, decry all the
Republicans purpose to do. declare itself ashamed of
our recent achievements in peace and in war, condemn
the administration, denounce the gold standard and
disavow its own record.
There is nothing in the way of a puzzle in the pre
diction. No one will be in doubt as to which plat
form will be adopted at Philadelphia and which at
Kansas City. The difference between the positive
optimism of the Republican party and the negative
pessimism of Democracy was never more clearly
manifest than at this time. There is on the one side
a record of great work accomplished and on the other
a carping criticism of the work itself and of the
methods by which it was performed. One party has a
programme of progress and improvement. The other
has nothing but a confused clamor of discontent and
denunciation.
PARTY PLATFORMS THIS YEAR.
BY way' of contribution to the political predic
tions of the season the Philadelphia Press re
/ccntly. declared the platforms which the two
great parties will adopt this year can be summarized
in parallel columns thus:
"We Indorse â "We repudiate â
We rejoice â . We mourn â
We gloryâ We decryâ
We are proudâ We are ashamedâ
We heartily supportâ We condemnâ

According to Professor Washburn Hop
kins of Yale University, who In 1397 made
a study of the famine then prevailing In
India, the need in India Is not for addi
tional provisions, but additional money.
"There Is no lack of grain." he writes,
"there 1* no scarcity of supply." He con
tinues: "Why, then, are the peasants
starving? For the plainest reason, because
"Drought Is the cause. Whenever the
monsoon rains fail and the winter showera
also fail, there will always be a famine as
long as the Hindu ryot remains what ha
is by nature and through inherited inabil
ity to escape the money lender. The peas
ant works hard, but he is always In debt.
Not only can he not save, but he will not.
When times are prosperous he lives as
easily as he can; when bad times coma hÂ«
is unprepared, now as always."
Professor Hopkins scouts the Idea that
there were no famines in India before the
advent of British rule. Famines lasting
for years prevailed under Hindu and Ma
hammedan rule. Now the measures, both,
of prevention and relief, are vastly greater
than they were then, and the burdens of
taxation very much lighter. The professor
repeats that the improvidence of the peas
ant class Is the chief cause of the trouble.
For a wedding or a funeral the ryot will
cheerfully double the mortgage on his es
tate, paying to the native usurer ISO to
300 per cent Interest, and this, too, "not on
the sum loaned, but on this sum with a
cipher added, which the usurer knows
how to tack on and the peasant la too Ig
norant to discover."
} h *iT & a T? no mopey to buy this grain. It
Is held by merchants, who have
for the multitude but will not rive It
away; nor may the Government compel
them to do so or connive at looting It If
any charitable folk will help the natives
of India, and great Indeed Is thetr need
let them cable money, not send corn."
But the professor denies that this lack
of money is due to the establishment jf a
gold standard or to excessive taxation,
or to the British misgovernment of any
kind. He writes:

our poor human nature has presented In

ing in view of the fact that it Is the

rill that is best in civilization." The Phila
delphia North American makes the con
trast still more vivid. It quotes as fol
lows the appeal from the Christian Her
ald, which is raising funds for relieving
the famine:

Water Front Notes.
The trouble arose in this way. On No
vember 15, lbO6, the British ship Kensing
ton arrived here from Europe with a gen
era! cargo. Charters were few and far
between in those days, and as the owners
of the vessel could not get a reasonable
hgure for ttie use of the vessel tney de
cided to lay ner up. The entire crow de
serted ana the Kensington was taken, to
Kaus-alito, where she was anchored off
"Baron" Guitalae's place. As there was
no crew aboard Captain Borland had no
one to man his gig, so made arrangement*
with Guitalde tor the hire of one of his
dingeys. The Kensington lay, at Sausa
lito f 10m December, 'Â»>, to September, '97,
and then in the hurry of getting away
Captain Borland forgot to return Gui
talde's boat. Since then the ship and the
dingey have been to England, France,
Germany, around the Horn to Australia
and tinally reached t5an Francisco once
again a few days ago. In the meantime
".Baron" Guitaldo has been without hlb
boat and now he proposes making the
good ship Kensington pay for his Ios3.
The vessel has been away from here a4i
days and the Baron thinks he is entitled
to $1 a day during that time; then hÂ«
also asks for some back pay and dam
ages.
The chances are that the whole matter
will be amicably settled and that the cap
tain and the "Baron" will ba as good
friends as ever inside of a week.
It is over a question of boat hire that
the captain and the "Baron" are at outs.
The latter asserts that there is ?1000 com
ing to him in the regular way and J50') for
damages, while the captain laughs at the
demand and offers the Baron $20 In settle

Captain Borland of the British ship

chances are that a lawsuit will settle
their differences. The captain is master
of one of the finest vessels that comes to

he runs a famous clam chewder resort

Mrs. Vroom had saved about $3000,
which she put into â¢ the Addison- Vroom
Company, but through her husband's mis
conduct with the Morrell woman the com
pany disbanded and she lost her money.
She has been playing an engagement at
the Dewey Theater, Oakland, which con
cluded Saturday night. In speaking of
that she said yesterday:
"All week I played while my heart was
breaking. I wanted to give myself up, but
they would not let me, as It would have
spoiled the play, so I struggled on, but
little did the audiences know how much it
cost me." . '
The young woman, Helen Morrell, who
alienated Vroom's affections, from his
wife, has also disappeared from the city
and no trace of her can be found. The
Â§ollce are incensed at Dr. Charles J.
chmelz, 721 Howard street, who attended
Vroom after he was shot for not report
ing the affair, and Captain Seymour said
yesterday that if the law could reach him
action would be taken- against him.
The police learned yesterday that Fred
erick Vroom, the wounded husband, had
gone to Seattle, probably on his way to
Cape Nome, and as he will not be here to
swear to a complaint or prosecute the
â¢case .will no doubt be dismissed.
J Judge Cabaniss happened to be holding
court discharging the "drunks" and Cap
tain Seymour sent for him. Mrs. Vroom
repeated her story to the Judge, who was
strongly moved by the tearful recital, and
with that gallantry tor which he is noted
he suggested that the charge should -be
assault with a deadly weapon, but the
captain demurred and ordered the charge
of assault to murder to be made against
her. The Judge with -the consent of the
captain fixed her bal>- at $25. She prom
ised faithfully to be in court this morn-
Ing, and Detectives Dillon and McMahon
were detailed to accompany her to her
home at 407 Van Ness avenue to enable
her to get the money. They returned
with her and she deposited the $25 with
Warrant and Bond Cierk Greeley and \.as
released from custody. Â¦
' "He struck me on the ' face and on thÂ«
breast and arm before I shot him," she
said, "and I can bring witnesses who will
testify that the marks of the blows can
yet be seen on my breast and arm. He
had turned to bolt the door to prevent me
from leaving the room when I fired the
shot. I might have had some pity for him
if he had shown any regret for his cruel
conduct, but he only, said with a fiendish
leer that he thought he was a good gen
eral, but I had been more than a match
for him. He has ruined me financially
and broken my heart." 'Â¦

why she shot him.

/ Clay fought against odds. Hl3 long ser
vices in Â¦ the cause ' of protection were by
a bold Democratic trick brought to
naught. Polk. 1 the free trader, was made
to write a letter declaring in a vague
way for "fair and. just protection to all
the great - interests of Â¦ the whole Union."
and , one " of Â¦ the : Democratic campaign
shouts was "Polk, Dallas and the tariff
of 1842; we dare the Whigs to repeal it!"
The Whigs, party of great men,"
were now really led by them. A ratifica
tion meeting of young Whiga was ad
dressed by a splendid array of orators.
Webster ignored past jealousies and spoke
in warm eulogy of his great rival. Clay
felt that at last the glittering prize for
which he had so long striven was within
his grasp. There seemed no question cf
defeat by this puny Democratic cham
pion. But Clay was, after all. hampered
by his brilliant - "record." and Polk had
none. , Besides, Democratic party discip
line was firm. Dissensions disappeared
as the party lash whipped the recalcit
rant into line.
Under the excitement of the annexation
question the two party conventions were
heldâ both at Baltimore. Once more the
Whigs were eagerly confident. Things
had been turning their way. Their be
loved Clay was now at last to lead them
to victory. He was nominated by accla
mation with the wildest enthusiasm and
he stood upon a platform of his own mak
ing. This declared for a tariff, for land
distribution, for economy and a well
regulated currency. It avowed hostility
to executive usurpation, but said not a
word about Texas, the real issue of the
campaign. The Whigs ardently hoped
that the Democrats would nominate Van
Buren. who opposed annexation, that the
question might not figure in the contest.
Van Buren was indeed th*v leading can
didate-before the Democratic convention,
and but for the adoption of a new rule
declaring two-thirds of the votes of the
convention necessary to a choice he
might have been the nominee. Juntos K.
Polk, a pronounced annexationist. but al
most , an unknown man. was nominated
and a platform was approved denying most
of the principles adopted by the Wh!sr*
and. declaring "the annexation of Texas"
to be a "great American measure."
The Campaign of 1844.
Tyler early aspired to be chosen by the
people in 1S44 to the place which he al
ready occupied through accident. To that
end he strove to become the head of a
party. At first he dreamed of uniting the
moderate of both parties under his leader
ship. Failing in that and finding himself
hated by the Whigs and not really trusted
by the Democrats, who at all events pre
ferred their tried leaders, he determined
to use his position to further his aims.
The civil service was prostituted to the
winning of votes for Tyler, while his
newspaper organ extolled Tyler as the
great and only man who could unite
North and South. This also failed, but
the schemer had one more card to play
which was to work the final undoing: of
the Whigs. Secret negotiations for the
annexation of Texas went on for months
with the President's connivance or at his
prompting, and on the eve of the election
the country was thunderstruck by the an
nouncement of measures of annexation.
The subject will be considered more fully
In a future chapter.
Tyler and Annexation.
Webster, Secretary of State, had remain
ed in Tyler's Cabinet when his colleagues
resigned, in order to complete some Im
portant diplomatic business. A variety
of disputes had arisen during several
preceding years which had brought about
strained relations between Great Britain
and the United States. After long nego
tiation with Lord Ashburton, the British
envoy, Webster succeeded in arranging a
treaty which finally settled the Maine and
New York boundary, provided for the
extradition of certain classes of criminals
and for the keeping of a squadron of ves
sels by each of the two powers on the
coast of Africa for the suppression of the
slave trade. The treaty signed, Web
ster also left the Cabinet.
The Ashburton Treaty.
These high hopes were speedily dashed
to the ground by the sudden death of the
President just a month from the inaugu
ration day. For the first time a Vice Pres
ident became President. Tyler's views in
respect to a bank were known to be those
of the Democratic party, but it was be
lieved that he would feel bound to carry
out the will of the party which elected
him. The first act passed by the special
session called by President Harrison was
the repeal of the independent treasury
bill. This President Tyler signed. But
when Congress proceeded to pass a bill
for a new United States bank the measure
was vetoed. A second bill with slightly
different provisions fared likewise. The
Whigs now saw that they had placed a
Democratic President In power, whose
purpose was to hamper and thwart them
at every point. A bitter feud developed.
All the Cabinet. Webster excepted,
promptly resigned. A meeting of the
Whigs in Congress was held and the Pres
ident "was deliberately "read out of the

Other vetoes followed. The Government
was in great financial straits. Congress
passed bills for increasing the duties,
coupled with a measure, to which the
Whigs were committed, for distributing
among the States the proceeds of public
land sales. One after another they were
returned with the President's veto. At
last enough of the Whigs were willing to

VT. THE WHIG PARTY.
(Concluded.)
THE WHIG PARTY IN AMERICAN POLITICS.:
Copyright, 19OO, by Seymour Eaton,
Clay was even made to appear an en
emy of protection. Thus hoodwinked.
Pennsylvania, the stronghold of protec
tion, with her twenty-six electoral votes,
went Democratic.
And the Whigs were forced, after all,
to meet the question of annexation. Clay
had expressed views satisfactory to thÂ»
moderate antt-slavery men and which at
tracted also the anti-3lavery Democrats.
But the Southern Whigs urged him to
modify his position, and unwisely he un
dertook to please all sides. His "Ala
bama letters" gave with some reserve
approval to TexaÂ«i annexation and af
firmed that the subject of slavery "ought
not to affect the question one way or the
other." This was fatal. Henceforth the
great Whig leader stood before his coun
trymen a political trimmer â a man will
ing- to sacrifice his principles for votes.
He had weakened himself in the North
without strengthening himself In tha
South.
The election grievously disappointed tha
"Whigs. Though the popular vote wu al
most equally divided. Polk had an elec
toral majority of sixty-five. Twice more
the Whig party was to join battle with
its enemies in a Presidential contest, but
never arain would it come before the
country as a party of genuine convictions.
Its career has associated the name Whig
with certain doctrines, which, however,
the party has feared to put forward In
campaigns, and when it has mustered
courage to do suit has been beaten. With
a tnagnincent array of great â¢ men for
party leaders, with a worthy group of
political principles to uphold, the Whigs
nevertheless failed to effect what was
rightly expected of them, for lack of fidel
ity to real conviction and genuine politi
cal morality.
The Liberty Party in 1844.
A convention of Abolitionists organized
as the Liberty party in 1S40 and nomi
nated a national ticket. Their 7059 votes
had no effect upon the election and at
tracted no attention from politician!*.
But It was the rise upon the far horizon
of a cloud no larger than a man's band
which was ere long to blot out the sun.
In 1S44. after Clay's unlucky attempt to
occupy both sides of the annexation ques
tion, a great defection of anti-slavery
Whigs swelled the ranks of the Liberty
party. This was the real cause of Clay's
defeat. The Â«2,300 anti-slavery votes were
drawn mainly from' his party. But for
his temporizing attitude it is probable
that the Abolitionists would have made
no nominations. But the appearance of
Clay's Alabama letters Just before their
convention gave unexpected importance
to anti-slavery action. It was in effect
the Liberty party that elected Polk and
annexed Texas.
Campaign in 1848.
By the election of Polk the country had
pronounced for annexation, and the Con
gress which met In December, 1844, haa-
HEXRT CLAT.
tened to approve the joint resolution for
the admission of Texas. President Tyler
signed the document just as he was retir
ing from onlce. War with Mexico fol
lowed, from 1S4G to 1S4S. Though the
Whigs opposed the war they voted for the
support of the army in the field and won
much glory from the fact that many of
the most successful general3 were of their
party. One of their number, General
Zachary Taylor, became their candidate
for the election of 1S43. He was a slave
holder, but a man who had paid little at
tention to politics and had no party affil
iations in the past. Now he avowed him
self "a Whis. though not an ultra on 1 *."
Five political groups made nominations
for this campaign, showing the tendency
to disintegration in both the great parties.
The Liberty party named John P. Hale of
Xew Hampshire as its candidate. The
barn-burners, a Northern faction of tha
Democrats, withdrew from the Demo
cratic convention and nominated Van
Buren. He was nominated by the free
soilers also. They were an anti-slavery
group, less-radical than the Liberty party.
Lewis Cass of Michigan headed the Demo
cratic ticket. He advocated the doctrine
of "squatter sovereignty," which would
leave .the question of slavery In the Ter
ritories to the people of each Territory.
This as allied to their favorite State
rights principle was expected to com
mend the candidate to Southern Demo
crats, and to draw together the two wings
of the party, so as to prevent a division
on the subject of slavery.
Once more and for the last time the
Whig party elected a President, in ISIS.
carrying 1 more Southern than Northern
States.
The free-soilers and the barn-burners
both opposed the extension of slavery to
the Territories, while the Whigs charac
teristically shirked the main issue and
formed no platform. The real question,
was the adoption of the Wilmot proviso
forever excluding slavery from all Terri
tories acquired from Mexico. It had been.
Introduced in Congress two years before,
but failed to pass. Southerners stoutly
opposed it as destructive of their chief ob
ject in acquiring territory on the south
west. Many preferred the dismember
ment of the Union to the adoption of such
a principle. At the same time the ex
treme abolitionists felt that the provisions
of the Wilmot proviso fell far short of
the national duty. They demanded the
total and immediate abolition of slavery
in the United States or the destruction of
the Union.

Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets can be found
in drug stores and costs but 5t> cents per
parka qe. Â¦HBHHHHfHBP9i
If there 13 any derangement of the
stomach or bowels they will remove It and
the resultant effects are good - digestion?
good health and a clear, bright complex-
ion* ' Â¦ ' * "
Bear ln mind that beauty proceeds from
good health, good health results from per-
fect digestion- and we have advanced tha
best argument to induce every man and
woman to give this splendid remedy a
trial. "*MA?CI>*WWHfeR<limJ*"
Many ladies diet themselves or deny
themselves many articles of food solely in
order to keep their complexion clear.
When Stuart's Dyspepsia tablets are used
no such dieting is necessary; take these
tablets and eat all the good, wholesome
food you want and you need have no fear
of indigestion nor the sallow, dull com-
plexion which nine women out of ten
have, solely because they are suffering
from some form of indigestion.
This is the reason so many ladies ara
using Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, because
they promptly cure any stomach trouble
and they have found out that perfect di-
gestion means "a perfect complexion and
one that does not require cosmetics and
powders to enhance Its beauty.
It Is impossible to have a good complex-
ion unless the digestive organs perform
their work properly; unless the stomach
by properly digesting the food taken Into
It furnishes an abundance of pure blood,
a good complexion is impossible.
Depends on Good Digestion.
This Is almost an axiom, although Â«Â«â¢
ually we are apt to think that cosmetics,
face powders, lotions, fancy soaps, etc.,
are the secrets for sectoring a clear com-
plexion. But all these are simply super-
ficial assistants.

mere technicality. It was J. B. Lamkln
of the San Jose club who started his man
a year ago forgetting to give him a
packet, and it was J. B. Lamkin who in
sisted yesterday that his club should be
awarded the race because the Olympics
had dropped theirs accidentally.
The race itself was almost bare of in
cident other than the foregoing. The three
clubs were separated by but a second
apiece at the end of the first ten miles,
as will be seen by the following score:

Â«-irâ HE Olympic Club Wheelmen won the
Â¦I eighth annual 100-mile relay race
U of the California Associated Cycllsfs
around the bay of San Francisco
yesterday. Edmund Russ crossing- the
tape in Alameda for them a wheel's
length ahead of Milton Francis, the cour
ier of the Garden City Wheelmen of San
Jose. Owing to a technicality, however,
which the Garden Citys persisted In tak
ing advantage of. the Olympics will not
retain the trophy, and it rroes to the San
Jose Club. The Bay City Wheelmen were
third, finishing about 40 seconds behind
the leaders. The time made, 4 hours 51
minutes 16 4-5 seconds. Is 6 minutes slower
than the coast record, made In last year's
race.
In relay races each club furnishes the
rider of the first relay with a leathern
packet, containing a letter from the Mayor
of this city to the President of the Board
of Trustees of the city of Alameda, the
race being between San Francisco and
Alameda by way of San Jose, The let
ter contained In these packets reads as
follows :
SAN FKAN'CISCO, Kay 8. 1900.
Hon. J. G. Brick. President Board of Trus
' teeÂ«. City of Alameda^Dear Sir: On May
E 13 1900, three contestant* will start from
this city on a bicycle relay race around
the bay of San Francisco with a letter
6lml!ar to this, which will be In the pos
session of each rider. The one arriving
first will deliver the letter to you. I trust
you will eee fit to crown the successful
contestant and proclaim him victor. Re
spectfully. JAMES D. PHEL.AK, Mayor.
' The rider of the first relay, at the end
of his ten-mile run, hands the packet to
the man of his club who is to ride the
second relay, and the exchange is affect
od in a similar manner at the end of each
relay. These exchanges are made at
lull speed, the new courier usually going
down the road a short distance to get
under way before his man comes along.
The exchange can be made at any point
â¢within 100 yards of the end of the relay
on either side of the tape.
All went well with the riders of the
three teams until the end of the eighth
relay, when Bozio, the Olympic courier.
In changing the packet from his right to
Â¦ bis left hand to pass It to Kragness. the
1 next Olympic man. dropped the precious
bundle. They were going at such speed
that to stop within a hundred yards was
Impossible, and, as time was exceedingly
valuable. Kragness kept on going, Bozio
handing him his handkerchief, which
Kragness In turn passed to Russ, the
Olympian on the tenth relay. Russ car
ried this across the tape in lieu of the
packet.
As a matter of fact the loss of the
Olympic packet did not affect the actual
result of the race one iota, as no time was
either gtalned or lost In the attempted
transfer. At a meeting between prom
inent officials <)f the Olympic and Garden
City dubs, held at the Olympic Club after
the race/ the Garden Citys insisted upon
a strict Interpretation of rule 10 of the
association relay rules, which is as fol
lows:
Each club contesting shall furnish the
rider of the firvt relay with a packet; said
packet must be transferred to the club's con
testant of each successive relay, the rider
of the last or tfnth relay to carry the
packet acroHs the line at the finish of the
109 miles.
The Olympics could probably have car
ried the matter before the association
with a pood chance of having their vic
tory confirmed, but they decided Instead
to yield to the Garden City's demand, and
the trophy passes to the San Jose Club.
Jt must be won three times to become the
final property of ajiy club, and the three
clubs have now an equal share In It, each
having the credit of one victory.
There were several protests registered
for alleged pacing, which is not per
missible under the rules. Bay City riders
were accused of accepting pace on the
second, third, sixth and ninth relays. A.
I* Hubbard, referee, at the end of the
sixth disqualified the Bay City courier of
that relay for this offense. The Garden
Citys also protested Against Russ. the
Olympian, on the tenth, accepting pace
from George P. Fuller, but withdrew the
charge upon hearing Fuller's own state
ment that he was out of training and
could not ride fast enough to pace Russ,
even If be 'were so Inclined.
In last year's race there was trouble
over packets on the first relay, and the
Garden City and Acme teams rode the
entire race without their packets. Before
thÂ«Â» result of the race was determined the
four clubs agreed that this should In no
vrlee affect the result, and that the team
crossing the line first should be declared
victor, packet or no packet. The Olym
pics won, however, and the question. was
dot raised. After such sportsmanlike
treatment from the San Francisco clubs
thÂ« latter feel that the Garden Citys are
not acting: very broadmindedly in insist
ing upon possession of the cup under a
Riders Who Played Prominent Parts in the Annual Bicycle Relay Race.
Bozio made a good ride for the Olym
pics on the eighth, bringing them up from
last to first place. The Bay Citys did not
lose much, but the Garden Citys fell back
quite a distance.
EIGHTH RELAY.
Warm Springs to two miles north of Centervllle.
Rifle and pistol shooters were out In full
force yesterday on the Shell Mound range,
members of six organizations partici
pating in their regular events. Light con
ditions were fairly good, but the wind was
not favorable for fine work with target
iirearms. It came In strong from the west
and frequently in gusts which kept the
marksmen guessing as to how to fix their
windages. For all this a number of good
scores were made. F. . E. Mason held in
his usual good form; making in the Golden
Gate Rifle and Pistol Club's medal event
Â£27 and 229 in ten short strings. J. Utschlg
of the Germanias carried off first honors
with 228 and 223. In this club's yearly
competition for cash prizes the pressure
Is becoming very great, dozens of good
three-shot scores being thrown out as of
no benefit to the shooters. F. P. Schuster
and K. Stettin improved their scores.
The members of the San Francisco
Schuetzen Club are looking forward to
the b;tr tournament to take place at Shell
Mound next Sunday and Monday. A large
number of prizes are offered and besides
those belonging to the club will hold their

Master Lawrence won the deciding
course In the open stake at Ingleslde
Coursing Park yesterday, with Prince Hal
as runner up. Lowe & Thompson's dog
was a surprise.' The work cut out for
him was of the hardest kind, but he
responded in good shape. . In the second
tie he beat Naughty Girl after a hard run
that lasted 2 minutes and 16 seconds.
The talent did not like his chances In
the next round, and made Tod Sloan
favorite against him, but Hal upset cal
culations by taking the flag in a hard
scoring run. He scored against One Spot
in the next tie, a punishing race, selling
short end at 1 to 4, and at the same odds
in the longest course of the day, a bye
with Cash Day, landed the money for his
few backers. He was all out when he
met the stake winner, who scored 32
points against his 4.
The winner 'was fortunate in having
short courses, but ran them well. In his
go with Rocker he won on the favor of
Chicago Boy was a 3 to 1 favorite in the
opening course, with Night Time, and,
though he got off well and led to the hare,
he weakened and lost the run.
St. Michael beat Wandering Tom at
1 to 2 In the first tie after an undecided
in a long race. Strand of Gold
showed some speed in the first tie, and
beat Morse Patrol, a 2 to 1 favorite. Low
lander, at 2 to 5, beat Battleship in the
second on merit, and in the next round,
again on the short end, beat Rienzi In
a close race, but went down before the
stake winner In the next round. -j

LAWRENCE WINS
AT INGLESIDE
Eugene Geary's young greyhound, Palo
Alto, defeated Luxor, the champion of
the coast, at Union Coursing Park yester
day, shutting out the Curtis crack point
less. -Palo Alto led to the hare, took two
turns out of it and killed, thus winning
by a score of 6 to 0. The duration
of the course was only seventeen sec
onds. The hare favored Luxor slightly,
so that Palo Alto earned all the credit In
defeating the former. , After disposing of
the champion, he met Theron, whom he
defeated easily. Mose was the next vic
tim, and then he met James Dean's Con
nemara, winner of many stakes. At the
first attempt they ran an undecided
course, the score being 2 to 2. Palo Alto
led by three lengths, but faltered a little
and the hare bent to Connemara. He
took two turns out of it, when Palo Alto
knocked It off its feet. He was allowed 1
point for this and 1 for speed, Connemara
earning his 2 points in tne turns.
They went back to slips again. This
time Palo Alto led by eight lengths a
portion of the way, getting the first turn
by five lengths. He then ran up a se
quence of 12 points before Connemara
could get in. When the latter did so he
scored 6 points. Including the kill, and
had to be content with being runner-up
to the peerless Palo Alto.
The English dog. Rural Artist, was
beaten by Mose by a score of 4 to 3. His
trial was a satisfactory one to the people
interested in him, as he, showed himself a
high-class greyhound.
In the first round of the* stake four ol
the eight favorites lost. Connemara beat
Flying Fox, 5 to 3; Theron beat Cavalier,
2 to 1; Palo Alto beat Luxor, 5 to 3, and
Royal Union beat Re-Annex, 5 to 3. Mas
ter Clalr defeated Ireland at 2 to 1. Ire
land was leading, but the hare turned to
Master Clalr.
The reserve stake was won by Curtis
& Son's Vulcan, For Glory being runner
up. The surprise of ihe day was the
showing made by Hot Haste. On Satur
day ho had a two-minute course and il
was thought he was out of the running.
He came back full of speed and was one
of the last four dogs in. In the next to
the last round he met For Glory, the
latter winning by a score of 3 to 2. The
hopes of the backers of Hot Haste were
raised for one brief moment. Judge Grace
inadvertently displayed the wrong signal
to the flag boy, but corrected the erroi
the instant it was made.
The coursing throughout the various
rounds of the stake was of high class,
the dogs being unusually well matched.
The attendance was larger than usual.
The biggest upset of the day was the
defeat of Boney Boy by Master Gordon,
the former being favorite at odds of 8 to
1. Echo beat ' Overture at 5 to 1; Juat
Tip beat Thorndale, 2 to 1; J. L. R. beat

FOUND HER BABY HAD
DIED IN ITS CARRIAGE
A supreme effort is being made by the
local Board of Health to rid the city of
rats. The rodents have become so num
erous and daring In their wanderings that
a halt has been called. A rat-killing ex
pedition was Inaugurated yesterday and
"Brick" Johnson, the driver of the City
and County Hospital ambulance, had
charge of the operating forces. Poisoned
nsh were placed in the sewers of China
town and other parts of the city under his
direction and within a short space of time
the hungry pests were eating voraciously.
The results were disastrous. Enough
poison was innoculated into each fish to
kill an army of rats. Every bite brought
death, but the unwise rodents took little
heed of the havoc the denizens of tho
deep were playing in their ranks. It is

Funeral of Ernest Schumacher At
tended, by Hundreds of Friends
Who Admired Him.
In the presence of hundreds who knew
and loved him well, the body of Ernst
Schumacher was laid away yesterday in
Mount Olivet Cemetery.
All day a throng of friends passed In
and out of the home of the deceased 20
Hill street, for there were few men better
known throughout the Mission, and there
were many who wished to pay the last
poor tribute to his memory by following
his bier to the grave.
There was no display and nothing elab
orate at the funeral. Short, simple ser
vices were all that were said over the
casket In the house and then the pro
cession took up its way to the cemetery.
There again was another, short prayer
and then the earth closed over the dead.
The pallbearers were all old friends.
They were Charles Hummel, J. Hefty, A.
Jacobson, H. SJober. H. Syricker and A.
Cotter.

As the engagement of James Nelll at
the California Theatre begins to draw to
its successful close, the versatility of the
actor assumes new proportions. Last night
he appeared as "Beresford Cruger."
a part in which Nat Goodwin won
his greatest popularity in this city,
yet many times during the perfor
mance of "An American Citizen" last
night it was a question open to discussion
as to which made the most acceptable
Beresford. Goodwin possesses a most
striking Individuality â Neill possesses all
the conscientiousness and polish of a fin
ished actor. Goodwin excels Nelll in com
edy scenesâ Neill excels Goodwin in the
love passages.
Aside from Mr. Neill, in many of the
situations it was Miss Chapman's night
to shine. In the scene of the floral fete
at Nice her costume of violets was a rev
elation. Frank MacVicars as Peter Bar
bury was the same careful and reliable
actor as he has been In every part he
has played here and the same may be
said of John W. Burton, as Sir Humph
rey Bunn. George Bloomquest appeared
in the small part of Willie Bunn and Rob
ert Morris had little to do as Otto Stroble.
Grace Mae Lamkin was the Lady Bunn.
and Lillian Andrews was tearfully capi
tal as Carola Chapin. Julia Dean
has a part that fits her pleas
ing personality like a glove. Ben
jamin Howard as Egerton Brown,
while possessing a valuable voice, con
stantly gives the impression that he is
suffering from that tired reeling. This
has been noticeable in several roles which
he has pleyed during the present engage
ment, and an effective spring tonic ls sug
gested as a waker-up for this talented
young man. Emmet Shackelford impart
ed to the role of Bimms. the valet, a most
interesting Individuality. Several new
and highly artistic stage settings were
again shown. The house was crowded
with a most apreclative audience, and
some people who started to leave before
the final curtain were hissed back into
their seats. "An American Citizen" will
do a big week's business. The third act ia
particularly good, and Mr. Neill's quiet
work earned him four well deserved cur
tain calls.
PLAY PEOPLE AND
THEIR OFFERINGS
. Â«
NEW YORK, May 13.â Spenser Wilkin
son of London, in an article "How Long
Will the Boer War Last?" which will ap
pear in the forthcoming edition of Les
lie's Weekly, says:
In the summer of 18S1 there were Drobably
few men in or out of the United States who
foresaw that the war of secession would last
for tour years: if any one had that opinion he
cained little credence for it at that time. In
June, . 1S66, only those who had special oppor
tunities of knowing the condition of the Prus
sian army foresaw that the Austrian empire
would be. suing for peace within six weeks of
the outbreak of the then pending hostilities.
The duration of a war depends partly upon
the nature of the country in which it ls waged,
but more upon the relative resources of. the
two belligerents and the energy and determina
tion which each of them throws into it. The
lost named is probably the most important fac
tor. 1 have from the beginning expected that
the Boers would make a. desperate fight. Ac
cording to their view the cause for which they
are in arms is that of their .independence or
their- national existence, and for this cause
every community fights harder and longer than
for any other.
Great Britain Is fighting for the unity of her
empire and for the moral existence of the
British nation. It ls a cause which appeals
less directly to the intelligence of the masses
than that of Independence, and the dispropor
tion between the resources of the British and
those of the Boers is so great that neither the
British Government nor the constituencies, by
whose tone it is accustomed to guide Itself.
ls abie to realize the importance of extreme
exertions to bring the war speedily to an end.
In the present case the British Governmentâ
the group of politicians in charge of the na
tion's affairsâ is not yot more than half awake,
and if the provision heretofore made for the con
duct of the war should prove Insufficient there
would be considerable delay before fresh ex
ertions by way of preparation would produce
a visible result. â
I hardly expect the resistance of the Boer
armies in the field to be prolonged for much
more than three months, but I should not be
surprised it the effective occupation of the
whole country required a further six months of
continuous effort. . ,
There are now under the command of Lord
Roberts altogether 190,000 men. and even if the
most liberal deductions be made for casualties
of all sorts, for Invalids, for garrisons left on
the communications and for troops stationed
in the districts lately disaffected, and If we
allow that there may be In Natal 40,000 to
Bupply a field force of 30, OW. there is still
abundant material for Lord Iloberts to attack
the Boers with a force outnumbering their
whole army. On the lowest estimate of what
the British commander in Natal can do he
must hold fast a respectable fraction of the
Boer forces. The remainder cannot, without
great danger, fight a pitched battle against
Lord Roberts, for in that case his attack will
certainly envelop them and Involve them in
disaster. At the best they can delay him and
harass his communications. It is little more
than a month's march from Bloemfontein to
Pretoria. The Boers, by the various expedi
ents open to- them, of rear guard actions and of
raids on the communications, may prolong this
time by a couple of months: but in the process,
even though they should escape crushing de
feat, their army would be used. After that
ther* iÂ» nothing left to them but guerrilla
warfare or the attempt at a wholesale "trek"
to the north.
This appears to me to be the normal forecast,
but I have no personal knowledge either of
the country or the people and there are many
unknown elements which conceal various possi
bilities which I cannot gauge. The whole of
South Africa ls inhabited by Kaffir tribes, who
far outnumber all the white settlers. If the
Kaffirs were to join in the fight on one side
or the other no one can foresee what would
happen. A second set of possibilities lies In
the general course of the world's affairs. The
longer the duration of the war the greater thÂ«
scope for the occurrence of unexpected events
in some other quarter of the globe, which
might modify the whole situation.

Situation.

"In San Francisco we have an example
of a good city charter with a very un
wise provision. That provision is the
clause that allows the Mayor to remove
at will any member of any public com
mission. There is thus established a 'one
man' power, something that should not
exist under any conditions, not alone to
spoil a city charter that is In many ways
a model.
"Instead of allowing the chief execu
tive of the municipality he right to de
pose a Commissioner, these officials
should hold office for a stated period.
"Until the branches of city government
are separated we must do the best we
can under the present inefficient ma
chinery." m
"Our organizations of city governments
are unadapted to good government. We
tried once in this city to separate the
branches of the municipal government.
The Board of Public Works under the
present charter before its amendment was
the beginning of a reorgonization, but the
people of Oakland were moved by ignor
ance and prejudice to amend it. As a re
sult, we have such a thing- as the City
Attorney called on to pass legally on his
actions as a member of the Board of Pub
lic Works. We find the City Attorney
bringing suit against the president of the
Beard of Public Works for the actions of
that official while Auditor. We find all
these Inconsistent things going on be
cause of the amendment of our city
charter.
"Under our present system of govern
ment of our cities one branch not only
collects the taxes, but has unrestricted
power to spend the money so raised,
were the cities of this country to model
their charters according to the great fun
damental principles of the Federal Con
stitution now different this would bÂ«.
There would be officers whose duty it
would be to raise funds, and others who
would be responsible for their disposi
tion. Reverse the conditions of Federal
Government as they exist and you would
have an open door to corruption. If the
Congress of the United States had the
power to levy and also to spend the
money raised by taxation all the charges
made against city government could be
hurled against the Congress of the United
States.
He said, in part
"While the municipal governments of
the United States collect annually an
amount of money as great as that requir
ed by the Federal Government of the
country, the systems of disposal of these
vast amounts of money are altogether dif
ferent. The Government of me Cnited
States is divided into three great
branchesâ legislative, executive and judi
cial. One branch raises the money for
the expenses of government by levying
taxes, while the other I divisions are
checKs on the injudicious expenditure of
that money.

In addition. Lane takes up the point
madn by J. J. Dunne, attorney for the
petitioners, in which he shows that
neither Alvord nor Tobin ever was dis
missed or resigned from the department,
and that therefore they were entitled to
redmnent. In answer, he calls attention
to the fart that there are numerous other
PX-Commissioners who never resigned or
â¢were dismissed from the department, and
he declares that if the contention be a
valid one In the case of Tobin and Al
vord, all the others who served, no mat
ter how short a time, can come forward
and claim equal rights.
Krorn these consideration*, without going into
;-r.y more thorcueh analysis Of the statute or
cf the rirtits of thÂ» parties. I am of opinion
that your board has no pawer to grant the ap
plicaticr.s herein considered
(t) The Leg:s'.aturÂ«* could not have intended
to include Commissioners under the pension
law for the further reason that ordinarily such
Commissioners are frequently changed and
there in no orr-ortunity for them to spend
twenty years in office. It happened in this in
stance cwing to the peculiar form of the stat
ute and the fact that it was not repealed until
the adcptlon cf the new charter, that their term
at office was unusually long. It ls claimed
that this loacttay and meritorious rerviee en
titles the applicants to liberal consideration at
the hand* of the present board. While *uch
long ar.d faithful performance of public duty
is alwHj -9 deserving of the highest appreciation,
euch appreciation should come from the people
at large; the jruardlaos of a trust fund are not
Â»t liberty to broaden and enlarge a fixed class
of beneficiaries so as to include claimants whom
they mr.jr deem particularly worthy cf public
oortf-identtion.
(5) The Board of Police Commissioners is the
civil heart at a quasi military body. The mem
bers of euch administrative board are not mem
bers of the Police Department except in the
broadest meaning of the expression. The Secre
tary of War conducts the vast affairs of the
army and yet. as Attorney General Win has
eaid. "he does not compose a part of the
arrr.y." tr> in the present instance it can prop
erly be said that the members of the Board of
Police Cr rrmisfioTiers. though at the head of
the Police I>t-nartmem. were not members of
such organized department within the sense of
the pension law. They were without "rank" in
the der&ruÂ«*-m upon which the amount of all
pensions depends.
(4) In the endeavor of the applicants to bring
themselves within Xbr term? of the statute it is
conceded by them that upon retirinc upon the
S'er.sion requested, they would nevertheless con
tinue members of the department and subject
to report and to be as-sipn.r.1 to duty as required
cf other pensioners. V. hat duties ex-memb^rs
of the Police Commtalofl might be aKipned by
the Chief of Police to jwrform are not men
tioned. The lopical ani only possible result of
the contention cf the present applicants ls that
ex-Poiiee Commissioners must serve as patrol
men if ordered to by the Chief of Police. A
OKMtmcttaa which make* such a conclusion in
t-vitaMe would give the Legislature very slight
cred.t Cor ir.teUitrence.
(1) The I'olice Con'Tiisslcn has bÂ«en vari
ously constituted during the history of the city.
At cr.e liiiif the memUni of the iioard of Â£u
jxirv:sors exercised its duties. At another time
It v.-as composed of the prerident of the Board
cf Supervisory, the Police Judge and the Chief
ct Police, who Â»Â«>re denominated the Poiice
Gomistaion. It Â»',ll not be seriously contend
ed that the** individuals were "duly appointed
or eeiecu-d memtx-rs cf the regularly consti
tuted Police Detriment." If not, then the
pert-ens composing the Police Commission as
existing immediately prior to the charter were
tot BDcb members.
O The law Â«as intended to benefit those who
pav* 1 their full time to the regular service, not
to tho*e who as Commissioners were required
to devote but & Fm&ll share of their attention
to their duties connected with the department
and who ran none of the risks incident to serv
ice in vh<? department.
(3) Two ooliara per month was deducted from
the ealary of each regular police officer as a
contribution to the fund. No such deduction
was made from the Commissioners' salary.
They did not contribute toward the fund in any
way. The commission might very well have
been comitosed cf those whose services were
given without salary, a? was the case when it
was composed of other city officials. Their po-
Bitions were rather positions of honor than of
reward.
There xv-ill b? no pension for ex-Police
Corr.in'.s^oners Alvord and Tobin if the
reasoning of City and County Attorney
L_tr.e"s opinion in the matter is followed
by the cc_rts--t!iat Ls. should the matter
ever Â£'i as far as the courts. Lane does
not th.r.k they are entitled to anything
because they never shared any of the
dang' r, forthe braving of which the pen
e:o:. lund is provided as a reward, nor
diU they ever contribute a cent toward
it, two things which Lane believes prac
tlcalxy Kettles their status in regard to
; t nslons. la h:s opinion he gives these
reasons why the ox-l'uhce Commissioners
fciiould live on their own money:

A reliable water supply may be fur
nished to the central part of Calaveras
County. Messrs. Emery and Thompson
have engaged an engineer to inspect the
water supply of the middle fork of the
Stanislaus River and to devise a way to
get the water across the Intervening can
yons.
Two new gold mining companies have
incorporated in Nevada County â the

Most of the better known mining proper
ties have been bonded.
The annual report of State Mineralogist
A. S. Cooper gives a panoramic review of
the mineral resources of the State. If tha
miner or prospector or Investor wishes to
know where . any one of. tho products
enumerated as being mined in California
last year Is to be found the report is " a
ready reference. The point of most inter
est to tho average man is probably the.
premiership cUtriDuted to tlie several
counties, in total mineral productions
Shasta County was tasily rtrst, having to
its credit Vt.ClM.&tt! NteVkda] the second on
the list, mude a record of mineral prod
ucts vaiueu'ut Â»2,2ai,ays. The other coun
lifs-who.su products m minerals exceeded
M.wO.tXW were as follows: San iiernardiro,
41,fc3Wol; i^os Angeles. $1,729,W4; Tuoiumne,
*l,ii5o,8iu; Amador, |l,593.7i'0; Calaveras,
Â»l.au3.18b; Placer, $1,177.M2; Kern, $1,027,8*.
teiskiyou crowded closely the million dol
lar limit. It is credited with 1991,871, which
really puts it In the million-dollar class.
It will surprise miners to see Alameda
County p-aced ubove Butte, Inyo. Sierra
Kl Dorado. Plumas and Lassen as. a- pro
ducer of minerals.
Copper was mined In Calaveras, Iseva.la,
San Bernardino and Shasta counties. Coal
was produced in Alameda, Amador, Con
tra Costa, Kern, Orange and Riverside
counties. The lead was .from Inyo, Mono
and San Diego counties. Mineral paint
was mined in Butte, Calaveras, Nevada
and Stanislaus; quicksilver came from
Lake. Napa. San Benlto, San Luis Obispo,
Santa Clara, Sonoma and Trinity. Natu
ral gas was utilized in Sacramento, san
Joaqum and Santa Barbara.
The banner counties imvarious products
were as follows: Alameda in â¢Â¦'alt, man
ganese, macadam and coal; Amador in
marble; Butto in mineral paint; El Do
rado in slate: Inyo in lead and soda;
Kern in fuller's earth; Los Angeles In
gypsum, petroleum and serpentine; .Napa
in magnesite and quicksilver; Nevada In
gold and pyrites; Riverside in asbestos;
Placer in granite; Riverside in asbestos*,
pottery clay and quartz sand: San Bernar

ing blocks; San Diego in lithia-mlca; San
Francisco in rubble; San Joaquin in nat
ural gas; Santa Barbara in asphalt; Santa
Clara in brick clays; Santa Cruz in bi
tuminous rock and lime: Shasta Coupty
leads in copper, producing the bulk, of that
metal; to the amount of $3,585,023. It also
leads in the production of silver.
A decision of considerable Importance to
miners has been rendered by Frank D.
Hobbs. Register of the United States
Land Office at Salt I^ake, relating to the
performance of work in a shaft on ground
outside of the claim or group of claims,
for their benefit and for patent purposes.
The substance is that labor upon one of
several mining, claims held in common, or
upon ground outside of the limits of such
claims, may be accepted in satisfaction of
the statute as to all claims so held, if
such claims are adjoining or contiguous,
so that each claim thus associated may
be benefited by work done or improve
ments made. Where the expenditure of la
bor or improvements relied upon is only
had in one of several adjoining or contig
uous claims, held in common, the applicant
must show that such expenditure was In
tended to benefit and will benefit all the
claims; where the labor or Improvements
are not on the claim or upon any of sev
eral adjoining or contiguous claims, -held
in common but outside thereof, the appli
cant for patent must show that the work
Is of a character to aid in the develop
ment of the claim, or claims in common, as
the case may be. Labor 'or Improvements
Intended ior the benefit of several non
continguous mining claims cannot be ap
portioned to the different claims in satis
faction of the required expenditure there
on, for the reason that to do so would be to
credit each claim with" an expenditure
made in part for the benefit of other
claims, not associated therewith as
claims held in common within the mean
ing of the law.

Baptist Church: Rev. "\V. W. Grimes,
A.B., pastor of Bethel A. -M. E. Church,
and Rev. A. J. Woodward, pastor ! of
A. M. E. Zion Church of Oakland. Hymns
were sung by tho choir, consisting of
Mrs. Mary Butler, Mrs. Susan Johnson,
Mrs. Lavinia Parker. Mrs. Ida White,
Mrs. Eva Lundy. Miss Artie Derricks,
Mrs. Anna Clayton, Miss May Butler,
Charles Ringold, J./L. Derricks and J. L.
Clayton. The choir also officiated at the
morning and evening exercises.
In the evening the choir sang "Old
Hnndred," "America" and "The Red,
White and Blue," after which the.open
ing address was delivered by George W.
Dennis Jr. The address of the evening was
delivered by Samuel M. Shortridge, who
eloquently reviewed the work of John
Brown in the cause of freedom.
Mr. Shortridge, looking at a picture of
John Brown draped i with an American
Hag, said that under that banner all men
were free; that this was not so when John
Brown was born-KK) years ago. He then
traced the growth and development of
slavery and described the conflicts that
arose between the slave and the free
States. T
"In 1620." he said, "two trees were
plantedâ the tree of liberty at Plymouth
Rock and the tree of slavery at James
town, Va. They grew and flourished, and
not until by the providence of God such
men as Brown rose was the tree of slav
ery destroyed." - , **
Mr. Shortridge desyribed^ the life and
work of John Brown, which closed at Har
pers Ferry, and his execution on the scaf
fold-December 2^ 1859. Then he quoted: :
But whether on the scaffold high .
Or In the battle's van
The fittest place where man can die
Is where he dies for man.
"Men say he failed," continued the ora
tor. "He did not fail. Robert Emmet did
not fail when he died on the scaffold. Al
gernon Sydney did not fail when he met a
like fate. Joseph Warren did not fail
when he shed his blood on Bunker Hill.
John Brown diedâ died for man. His body
made sacred the earth, but his soul goes
marching on.
"Free negroes fought at Bunker Pllll.
They did not know that they were break
ing the chains of one race to Â» transform
them- into fetters for their own. Freedom
in, all ages and in all countries has been
won by the sword. And it was the arm of
Brown, rthe triumphant sword of Grant
and the immortal pen of Abraham Lincoln
that made you free, made us free, made
this nation -a republic in fact as well as
in theory.'.'
THE celebration of the one . hun
dredth anniversary of tho birthday
of John Brown, who sacrificed nis
life for the cause of freedom for
the slaves,- was held yesterday at the A.
ai. E. Zion Church at S05 Stockton street.
The memory of the noble man whose
death only served to hasten the emanci
pation of the negro race of the country
was honored by prominent clergymen m
the colored churches, and also by white
epvakers, who had been invited to par
ticipate in the exercises.
In the morning at 11 o'clock special mu
sic war. provided by an augmented choir,
and the sermon was delivered by the pas
tor of the church. Rev. T. Brown, whose
subject was, "John Brown, the Colored
lilan's Moses, and How to Prove Our-,
selves Worthy of His Sacrifice."
"As Moses liberated the children of
Ipraol from their 430 years of bondage in
the land of Egypt and Canaan," said Dr.
Frown, "so John Brown was the Moses
oÂ£ the negroes In freeing them from
their 250 years of slavery. John Brown
brought about their freedom with the as
sistance of Lloyd Garrison, "Wendell
Phillips. Thaddeus Stevens, Charles Sum
ner, the Beechers and Abraham Lincoln.
Brown was true to his convictions that
it was never intended that slavery should
exist by the framers of the Declaration
of Independence, which is the foundation
of this republic. He gave his life to free
4.0U0.U00 slaves, and it is incumbent upon
us to show our great appreciation of his
sacrifice by helping to build up the re
ligious fitr'.'.cture of the colored race and
to prove to the world that we are fully
cognizant of the great benefits resulting
from his actsâ benefits that apply not
only to us, but the people of this entire
nation." ' â¢ /
In the afternoon union services were
also held at -the Zion church by the
Third Baptist and - Bethel A. M. E.
congregations. An interesting feature
was the remarks of David Ruggles, a
former slave, who is now 90 years of age.
He was escorted to the 'chancel by two
members of the congregation, and in a
clear voice told of his experiences in
the times when a negro was regarded as
a chattel and fit only to serve a master.
He blessed all those who had - been- in
strumental In freeing himself and oth
ers of his race, and paid a glowing tri
bute to the man in whose honor the con
generations had gathered. :
Addresses were also delivered by Rev.
J. H. Kellogg. D.D., pastor of the Third
Aged David Rugrgles Tells of Slavery Days.

"My Jack" Donovan doesn't like the
San Francisco public. After Saturday's
few fierce moments with sibilant fan
atics and righteously wrong stickmen he
sloughed valor and clung to discretion,
giving way to a new umpire. J. Fernald
Donohue. Donovan was real brave on
his home gTound. for he played umpire
again in the morning game. But there
are some who think Donohue is not wiser
or fairer than Donovan- Francks swat
ted the ball to Lockhead. who threw over
Courtney into the crowd. The ball was
passed back, put Into play and Francks
died at third. Hutchinson protested the
eanne. He thinks Donohue is a bad man
because he did not allow the runner to
po unscathed clean to the plate.
With the Bcore three- apiece in the
Feventh. Harper fell away In lumps and
the Dudes put the finishing touches on
the game. Hutchinson and Francks took
constitutionals and a hit by Moskiman
crowded the sacks. Dunleavy settled the
strain by a hit to right for two bags, scor
ing all three runners. That was all the
Dudes did in this Inning, but It was

Jack Donovan, who was bristling with
pain for Ill-deeds as a novitiate umpire,
did the calling and he called well enough
this time to satisfy the crowd.
The score:
Oakland runs and hits came in thick
bunches. In the first Inning the Dudes
untwisted Salisbury for a stack, scoring
three men on a couple of hits and some
choice errors. The fifth inning was murky
base-ball for the Stockton aggregation
and a fireworks display for Ewing's
Brummels. Four hits and three runs
made Harper's sacred nine look like half
of thirty cents.
Salisbury was an easy mark for the
Dudes on the Oakland grounds yesterday
morning. Twelve times he was scattered
over the field and as many times the
Dudes pushed men over the rubber. Be
ville was found eight times, but only five
of the Stockton men crossed the rubber.

enough. The protest will be withdrawn,
for something happened In the seventh
that put the Dudes in good humor and
they now admit that Donohue's work as
umpire was of good quality.
The spot Is an ideal one for a. wreck.
The bridge is so dark at all times that
thÂ« most observant engineer would hardly
have noticed the threateneing obstruc-
DASTARDLY attempt to wreck a
/P& passenger train on the western di
/==\ â¢ vision of the Southern Pacific was
ti v made at an eaily hour yesterday
morning, which had it been successful
would have resulted in an appalling loss
of life. The *cfT>e of the attempted wreck
is the bridge over San Lorenzo Creek be
tween Haywards and San Lorenzo, a long,
dark, tur.ncl-like structure that spans the
creek at an elevation of fully thirty feet.
At the entrance to this bridge three great
poles, each weighing 10"0 pounds, had been
placed acroFS the railroad track some
time after midnight Saturday, and had
the obstruction not been discovered and
removed before the first train from Oak
land was due yesterday -morning the un
fortunate passengers and trainmen would
have been dashed to almost certain death
in the creek below without a second's
warning.
The Sheriff's office and the special de
tectives of the Southern Pacific Company
were notified, but there is no clew to guide
them except some very Indefinite descrip
tions of tramps seen loitering in the neigh
borhood.
tlons piled up at its entrance, even in the
bright light of day.
The Standard Klectric Company, which
is bringing light and power from the Blue
Lakes to Oakland, is stringing its wires
aloce the right of way of the Southern
Pacinc Company from Nile?. The com
pany has scattered its poles along the
track for the entire distance, preparatory
Jo setting them in place. The poles are
the largest that are used for electrical
wiring in order to carry the heavy cables
that will be used for conducting the elec
trical current, each one weighing about
1000 pounds.
It was these poles that had been piled
across the railroad tracks at the approach
of the bridge. Fortunately the attempt at
wrecking was discovered at daybreak, be
fore the trains had begun to move, and it
was reported at the San Lorenzo station.
It took several hours of hard work to
clear the track, but this was llnally Gone,
accomplished with the aid of a team of
horses.
"We think Bowers and Driscoll are In
the right," he said. "The Labor Council
had no grievance when it declared the
boycott. As citizens of San Francisco we
have a right to go about our own affairs
as we see fit. There is a rush of work on
now and we would not think of taking
any undue advantage of ctmtractors be
cause of it."
"We have never had any intention . of
yielding in this matter," said Thomas
Westboy, chairman of the strike commit
tee of No. 8186, yesterday. "We are going
to, fight it out to the end and there may
be' a good deal of trouble before the end
comes. We have all the bosses on* our
side except the Whelans, but they get all
the transport work and that amounts to
a great deal. Our organization intends to
at once investigate this matter and find
out Why none of the other contractors can
get' any of the transport repairing. We
will send telegrams regarding this to
Washington to-morrow. We have all the
organizations with us save the Ship
wrights' Association."
President McConneJl of the Shipwrights'
Association said that body would stand
with Whelan' Bros, and the new organi
zation.
Another step the officers of No. 81S6 In
tend to take is that of preventing Whelan
Bros, from getting the repair work on
any more Government transports if pos
sible. This constitutes most of the work
being done ' here now, and the Whelans
get nearly all of It. President McKinley
and Secretary of War Root will be ap
pealed to.
A meeting: of No. R1S6 will be held "Wed
nesday night at 20 Eddy street, when im
portant action will be taken on matters
pertaining to the trouble on the front. At
this meeting the letter to be sent. Presi
dent Gompers will be formulated.
Painters, electricians and others who
v.-ork on ships being repaired may become
Involved If the war continues. These
nearly all belong to the American Feder
ation, and an order will probably be is
sued that none of them shall work on
jobs where any pf the Bowers-Driscoll
joiners are employed.
In the eyes of the American Federation
of Labor the members of the new organi
zation are "scabs." Because of this every
effort will of course be made to shut them
out of work. The new body claims most
of its members are secessionists from No.
8186. The officers of this organization Bay
the members of the rival body are nearly
all joiners who have been brought from
various parts of the country since the boy
cott was declared.
The Shipwrights' Association of San
Francisco, which is an entirely, inde
pendent organization, having no national
affiliations at all, stands with the Bowers-
Driscoll organization, and through its
president declares it will continue to so
stand.
The main grievance of &o. 8186 is against
Whelan Bros, and is based. on a, contin
uance of the troubles -of last DectmDer,
accounts of which have been publishea
heretofore. This trouble gave rise to the
Bowers-Driscoll union, the members of
which' are regularly obtaining work with
this contracting tlrm. There is some dis
trust of George Kundle, but the old or
ganization hopes to win him over. . Be
longing as it does to the American Fed
eration, No. S1&6 is backed* up by the
Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners,
and its stand has been indorsed by the
Building Trades Council and District
Council of Carpenters.. The boycott
against Whelan Bros, last December was
declared by the Labor Council and the
officers of the older shlpjoiners' associa
tion declare it has not been called off.
The fines against Driscoll and Bowers
imposed, by. the -original organization still
stand and the men will probably be of
ficially expelled. For this tney do not
care, as they think their new organization
is strong enough to hold out.
President Gompers of the American Fed
eration of Labor^ is to be appealed to, by
No. s>l&6 and upon nis decision the organi
zation will be largely Influenced in form
ing a future plan of action.
The war that is now on between the two
shlpjoiners' organizations of this city
may bring a great deal of trouble to
the ./Â¦ water front and cause much
embarrassment .. to contractors. Sympa
thisers of the new organization formed by
"Joe" Bowers and "Bob" Driscoll thought
the trouble was at an end, but the original
organization. Ship and Steamboat Joiners'
Union No. 8188, which was organized here
in 1&>7, has no idea of letting matters rest
as they are. On the contrary, officers of
this organization say it has just begun to
tight. "â¢ .
