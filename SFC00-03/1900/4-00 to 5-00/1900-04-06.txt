CHEERS FREE STATERS
AND ARRAIGNS BRITONS
PRETORIA, April 2.â ln his speech at
the opening of the Free State Raad, Pres
ident Steyn declared in spite of the sur
render of Bloemfontein he had not lost
hope of the triumph of the republican
cause. The war, he said, was forced upon
the Transvaal, and nothing remained for
the Orange Free State but to throw in Its
lot with its little sister republic In accord
ance with the terms of the treaty. The
war,'' he continued, was begun with the
object of maintaining. with arms the In
dependence bought with the blood \qt the
forefatheVs of the nation and had' been- bo
to any conference between him and Gro
ver Cleveland. William C. Whitney or any
other political men of prominence were
answered with the same phrase: "I earn a
here to attend the concert."
DEWEY'S RELATIVES
SAY HE'S A REPUBLICAN
BURLINGTON, Vt.. April s.â Hon. Red
fleld Proctor, "projector," or one might
say. godfather of Dewey's infantile Presi
dential "boom." which was launched im
mediately after the admiral's return from
Manila, and all the relatives and frlenda
of the admiral were thrown Into constern
ation and a condition bordering on panic
when they read their hero's announce
ment: "I am a Democrat."
"Land sakes. we all thought he was a
Republican." declared these good, pious
New Englanders. It is reported quietly
that they will hold a meeting and decide
upon a line of conduct.
When Admiral Dewey came home last
fall the appearance of a Dewey boom
for President was seen at Montpeller on
the same day it was recognized at Wash
ington. The Hon. Redfleld Proctor, then
with Dewey in the Capitol of his native
State, would not deny his interest in and
for a Dewey boom. The Dewey family 13
for the G. O. P., and Dewey, though never
an active voter, It is held, cannot logically
depart from inherited political traditions.
He cannot be anti-expansionist, when hia
own deeds gave the first impetus toward
expansion. Certain it appears to be that
the convention on the ISth will be sur
passingly interesting.
IVNDON. April 6, 5 a. m.â The War Office Issued no news yesterday, and little was allowed to come through from the
correspbnde&ta at Bloemfontein. According to the Standard's representative, there Is no sign that the Boers Intend taking
the offensive. General Clements is so disposing his forces as to guard against any surprise attack, which, although im
probable, is evidently not regarded as impossible, judging from the preparations of Lord Roberts.
As usual, whenever there is any check in the progress of the British campaign the War Office is being severely cen
cured for failing to maintain the necessary supply of remounts for the army. It is possible Ix>rd Roberts has difficulties
other than mounts with which to contend. Much anxiety is felt as to the water supply, despite the statement cabled homo
that there is no fear of a water famine.
Whatever the reasons may be. considerable dissatisfaction is beginning to be expressed here at the unaccountable de-
Jay, both at Bloemfontein and in Natal, which enables the Boers to recover from the demoralization caused by Lord Rob
erts' former rapid movements. The enemy now evidently hope to retard the advance by threatening the railway behind
Lord Robcrt>. So far as the Natal railways are concerned repairs are being made beyond Elands Laagte, and the Idea so
often repeated, is that an advance is Imminent.

T ON DON ', April 5. â A special dispatch -from Lorenzo Marques says sharp -fighting occurred on
/ April 2in the neighborhood of Mafeking. The garrison made a sortie while Colonel Plumer's
cavalry attacked the Boers at Ramathlabama. Both attacks were repulsed. Twenty of Colonel
Plumer's men were found dead on the field and six others were made prisoners. The Federal
losses were small. .'Â¦
PRETORIA, April 5. â In the fight of Ramathlabama the following were taken prisoners:
Captains Crew, Duncan-Robatson and McLaren (Crciv and Duncan-Robatson have since died) ; Staff
Officers Cecil and Granville and nine officers, of whom six were zvounded. The prisoners all belonged to
Colonel Plumer's Rhodcsian force. Thaba Nchu is now in possession of the Federals. Forty-one
British subjects were escorted across the border this morning.
The above picture, taken from the London Graphic, shows the Schatz Vek avenue end of the new military prison at
Waterval, some eight miles from Pretoria, on, the Delagoa Bay Railroad, where the greater part of the British prisoners
Jn the bands of the Boers are confined. At the first the racecourse at Pretoria was sufficiently large to accommodate
non-commissioned officers > and privates of the prisonersâ those taften at Dundee. Nicholsons Nek and Stormbergâ but as
the numbers Increased from time to time a larger place was found necessary, and this new prison camp was estab
lished, where nearly 3000 men are now confined, the rest being still at the racecourse. The officers, of whom there are
nearly 200. are at the Model School in Pretoria. The quarters at Waterval consist of long sheds of galvanized iron. The
whole inclOEiire is surrounded by a strong barbed wire fence and well guarded by sentries, mostly men above middle age.
According to the Graphic the prisoners are very appreciative of the kind treatment accorded to them. For a while they
were fed on the rations captured at Dundee, and later have had the same rations as those Issued to the families of the
burghers who are at the front. The mortality in these two camps is exceedingly small, a strong contrast to that among
the Boer prisoners at Simonstown.
PHILADELPHIA, April 5.â The Inquirer prints the follow
'JL ing:
FOR PRESIDENTâ GEORGE DEWEY.
FOR VICE PRESIDENTâ GOVERNOR THEODORE
ROOSEVELT.
Such is the ticket planned by Mrs. Dewey, the only person wJio
up to date has shown any inclination to assume the management of
the admiral's campaign.
It is stated on good authority that the wife of the admiral pro
posed the idea to a sister of Governor Roosevelt during a recent
visit to New York, and picturing to her the wave with which such
n^ticket would sweep the country, asked her to persuade the Gov
ernor to consent to such an arrangement.
WILLING TO RUN ON INDEPENDENT TICKET.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. WELLINGTON HOTEL. WASHINGTON. April 5.â
Satisfied from the expressions obtained by the Herald from national committee
men that his nomination by the Democrats at Kansas City is unlikely. Admiral
Dewey stands willing to run for the Presidency on an independent ticket. This
was made clear by the statements of the admiral to his friends this morning be
fore he left the city, but he has declined for the present to make a public dec
laration to this effect. Since his announcement as the people's candidate he
has, in conversation with friends who desired to know his politics, stated that ho
is a Cleveland Democrat. In conversation with a caller this morning he declared
that he had never voted in his life, and had no decided political views until Mr.
Cleveland's last nomination. He was then so strongly impressed with the man
and the platform adopted by the Democratic party that he was tempted to go to
his home in Vermont and cast his vote for Mr. Cleveland. He was unable to do
so, however, because of his official dutfes at the time.
Admiral Dewey has admitted to frlenda that he was encouraged to enter the
race by a group of, sound money Democrats.' Some members of the Cleveland
Cabinet and other men Identified with the Palmer ticket of 1596 are understood to
be supporting the admiral's candidacy. Their plan is to prevent Mr. Bryan from
obtaining the Democratic nomination at Kansas City, if possible.
The main object of Admiral Dewey' s candidacy is to defeat McKinley. The
admiral resents certain events which have occurred for which he holds the Presi
dent and his political advisers responsible. The admiral believed that Senator
Hanna feared the possibility of his becoming a rival of McKinley, and he thinks
he has proof by the attitude of the Ohio Senator with reference to the invitation
extended to him to visit Cleveland and Chicago. While the admiral probably
will admit he is not much of a politician, communications he has received from
all parts of the country make him confident that Senator Hanna and President
McKinley have excellent reasons for fearing the effect. The admiral's hostility
to the administration, therefore, may be accepted as one of the factors which de
termined him to become a candidate for the White House. Admiral Dewey would
prefer the nomination by the regular Democracy at Kansas City. Â£hould this be
conferred on him he would look for a platform similar to that of the sound
money Democrats, brought up to date by the insertion of planks deallnsr with
expansion, the status of the new dependencies, the pacification of the Philippines
and other questions which he thinks the people. would like him to express.
Those who favor the admiral breaking away, from the regular parties believe
that the result would be that he would draw more votes from McKinley than
he would from Bryan. Practical politicians here appreciate that the full effect
of the admiral's announcement of his candidacy cannot be estimated until the
views of the agricultural communities of the Northwest, West and Southwest
are learned. In these regions hero-worship is slow to disappear and the' senti
ment among the farmers may count for a great deal in reducing the vote upon
which McKlnley's managers are depending. Had the admiral announced imme
diately after his return from Manila that he would be a Presidential candidate
he would have had a respectable following, perhaps at Philadelphia and cer
tainly at Kansas City, and the farmers would undoubtedly have largely con
tributed to his support. They still have final voice, however, at the polls next
November and they may then be heard from in support of the naval candidate.
Were the election to take place at this time, when the farmers are indignant at
the administration and Congress for their policy toward Porto Rico, it is likely
that many of the radical Republicans of the- northwestern prairie States would
rather cast their votes for an Independent candidate than for McKinley, who
has failed to observe what he declared was his "plain duty."
There is no doubt that the. Republican managers have considered this aspect
of the matter, and while they may not be willing to concede the fact, they are
undoubtedly worried at the probability that as an independent candidate Dewey
may be able to dig a pretty deep pit for Republican prospects.

AN ENCOUNTER ON THE' HIGH SEAS.
VANCOUVER. B. C. April s.â Advices from the Orient state that the war
toward which Russia and Japan are believed to be drifting was almost precipi

press. On March 21 a Japanese battleship encountered a Russian cruiser in the
neighborhood or Hakkaldo. Without any warning the Russian discharged a tor
pedo against the battleship, but missed aim and the Japanese ship escaped un
hurt, but before, returning fired several shots at her assailant.
A report comes from Ncwchwang that the Russians are working day and
night on the railway in order to complete up to the Amur as soon as possible;
that the chief, engineer has gone to Peking to try to arrange for the purchase
of the Imperial Chinese Railway, and that Ylngkok (Newchwang) will be pro
claimed a Russian possession in the spring. The forts are being repaired, which
command the entrance to the river, which were destroyed by the Japanese.

PHILADELPHIA, April s.â The second

families of the soldiers and sailors who
were killed in the Philippine Islands was
given at the Academy of Music this even-

occasion was the presence of Admiral and
Mrs. Dewey, who came from Washington
for the purpose of lending their aid to
the concert by their attendance.
At the Bellevue Hotel, after the con
cert Admiral Dewey granted an inter
view to nearly a dozen newspaper men.
He said he was glad to receive the re
porters, but added that he had nothing
to say. At this, moment Mrs. Dewey
joined her husband in the reception-room
and after Introducing her he said: - * j
"Mrs. Dewey will talk," to which sho
replied, with a smile. "The admiral has
a mind of his own: he thinks for himself.**
"Are you correctly reported â¢ to be a
Democrat?" the admiral was raked, and
after a moment's hesitation he replied:
"Yes. I think I can answer that. Yes,
I am a Democrat."
"If the Republicans nominate McKin
ley and the Democrats nominate Bryan
for the Presidency would you run inde
pendently?"
"I won't answer that."
"The Democratic convention of Penn

IMPORTANT PAPERS
BRANDFORT, Orangi Free State,
April 2:â Burghers who are returning
from the scene vt the Sanr.as-Pcst am
buscade (also reierred to as Karee and
Korn Spruit) furnish interesting details
of the occurrence. It appears that when
the first retreating British^ wagon en
tered the drift the ambuscaders shouted
"Hands up," removed the officers and let
the cart through. This process was re
peated several times until the wagons ar
rived !n a bunch and the ruse was dis
covered, and a disorderly fight followed.
In one cart were two officers, to whom
Commandant de Wett shouted "Hands
up." One of them obeyed, whereupon the
other Ehot his comrade dead, refused to
surrender and was immediately shot.
The burghers lost three men killed and
ten wounded, including a field cornet.
Among the wounded was the Dutch mili
tary attache Nix, who received a bullet in
the chest. Altogether the Boers cap
tured 353 prisoners throughout the day.
Th? significance of the battle must not be
underrated. It was fought by a force of
Free Staters on the flat plains and withpuf
j-helter. The Free Staters are now de
sirous of marching <m Bloemfontein. and
the Transvaal officers are anxious to
tinulate the late successes of their allies.
All the Southern Boer forces have now
formed tinctures with the main Boer
army and form a large force of veterans.
Perhaps of greater importance* even
than the victory was the capture of
British Fcerot papers, including maps and
plans of 1977. 18SS and 1833, outlining elab
orate fchemf-s for the invasion of the
Orange Free State, and Transvaal and
giving a plan for reaching Johannesburg
from M&fcking along Dr. Jameson's
route, amended so as to avoid his mis
takes. Another gives a plan for the
march from Bloemfontein to Kroonstadt.

After paying a tribute to the memory
of General Joubert/ President Steyn said
that the British, notwithstanding their
overwhelming numbers, were violating
the flag of truce and_ the red cross, and
he was compelled to report the matter to
the neutral powers.
The President further remarked that
the attempt to create dissensions among
the burghers by the issuing of proclama
tions had failed. Referring to the cor
respondence between the South African
Presidents and Lord Salisbury. President
Steyn proceeded: "Not only were those ef
forts made but the republics had dis
patched a deputation to Europe and
America to bring the influence of neutral
powers in order to secure a cessation of
the bloodshed, and I greatly desire that
these efforts bo crowned with success."
After saying that the government had
raised a temporary loan with the Trans

prayer that the Free State be preserved
from being forced to give up Its dearly
loved Independence.

Spfdal Dispatch to The Call
WASHINGTON, April 5. â A'dmlral
Dewey was influenced, to declare himself
as a Presidential candidate at this time
by an idea, which Mrs,. Dewey shared
with him, that it was only necessary for
him to express a willingness to be Presi
dent and that he would sweep into the
White House on a wave of popular enthu
siasgi.
The criticism growing out of the ad
miral's marriage and the transfer of his
house proved a temporary damper, .but
he soon began to receive letters from all
parts of the countryâ from men, many of
them without great political influenceâ in
which the writers named him as their
choice for President.
The admiral also felt that he had not
been treated just right by the administra
tion and was quite willing to make the re
election of President McKinley less prob
able. Then came the Southern trip with
enthusiastic receptions at every stop along
the line nnd many references to the Presi
dency. Encouraged by the attitude of the
anti-Bryan men, it is said, he believed he
could stampede the Kansas City conven
tion and go into the campaign as a reg
ular Democratic nominee. - Â¦ . "-.
Politicians regard his nomination by
either party as out of the question, but in
some quarters it is thought possible that
he may yet be taken up as a third party
candidate, with the hope of drawing the
support of the gold Democrats. and of such
Republicans as are dissatisfied with the
administration for any cause.

tariff and declares in favor of such duties
only as are necessary for an economical
administration of public affairs. It de

JAPANESE MOB FORCES
SURRENDER OF PRISONERS
Hawaiian Officers Compelled to Free
Men Whom They Had Ar
rested for Gambling.
HONOLULU. March 30.â An Asiatic up
rising occurred at Pa'auhau plantation on
.March 17. Eight Japanese had been ar
rested for gambling. Three of them
bailed themselves out and then went
to look for money to bail out the
others; but soon after they had gone out
the camp was aroused and gathered to
rescue the prisoners. Between 100 and 2uO
Japanese, armed with cane knives and
clubs, forced the police to free the pris
oners and to return the bail money. The
money found on the gamoling mat was
also surrendered.

Â»
HONOLT'H:. March 30.â Two cases of
plague were reported on the 25th. Since
that date no cases have appeared. One
r>f the victims was h Japanese fisherman;
the other was a white man named John
Hurlry. It is learned that Hurley's last
Â«mr>loynunt was as a guard at the in
fectf-d Btablea in Iwilei, and it is br-lieved
that he contracted the disease at that
place. Another thÂ«Â»nry Is that the plague
csine from r"hinÂ«sp food, which, it is n.\
l*Â»gf>4. the man frequently used. The for
mer theory, however, seems most plaus-i-
At a recent meeting of the Board of
Healthj th<> committee on shipping filed a
report apainsi th* 1 removal <if restrictions
on !nt<T-lF!and traffic, and the report was
unanimously aonpted. There was a
preater ihan ordinary reason for adopt
ing the report. This was an objection to
reopening traffic by Dr. Carmirhael, head
of the marine hospital service. When in
formed of the proposed action of the
board, Dr. Carmlchael replied that if
there was any slackening of freight regu
lations he would report to his departmera
That he considered any cargo from the
Hawaiian Islands a source of danger.
This would embarrass if not check th*
landing of sugar at Â£an Francisco or New
Vnrk.
There is hop* for the hundred or more
men who want to ge.t away from here by
neerage.. The Australia on. her next trip
Â¦will probably take the steerage passen
gers who have, taken the prophylactic
treatment and complied with other re
quirements.
Dr. Carmlehacl has decided that in view
of the recognition r.ow given the prophy
lactic treatment as a preventive remedy,
effective for from thirty to forty days,
he will give permits for Ftecrag<> passage
to perrons wishing to go that way who
take the prophylactic strum, are in good
health, have their baggage disinfected
and are otherwise under sanitary condi
tions.
W. M. Giffard for the Oceanic Steam-
Fhin Company says that unless he receives
orders to the contrary before her next
hailing, the Australia will take steerage
passengers who take the treatment and
otherwise comply with the requirements.
GREAT CANE FIELDS
ARE SWEPT BY FIRE
Over Five Hundred and Thirty Acres
of the Hawaiian Sugar Com

HONOLULU. March 30.â A disastrous
rane flre swept over 530 acres on the Ha
waiian Commercial and Supar Company's
plantation nn the 20th. A thousand men
were engaged In fighting the flames. In
the early morning a field of traeh had
been burned and had been carefully
â¢watched by the managers and others un
til it was supposed all danger was over.
Several hours after this the adjacent field
of Ftandinp ran** was seen to be on fire.
Af the wind had increased to half a pale
rffortB to stop the fire were of no avail,
and but about fifty acres of cane to the
extreme windward were paved. I^anes
were cut and back firing was resorted to,
fcut the fire had started on the rast side
and the strong northeast wind drove the
lire ahead with Irresistible fury. It even
canal, Mr. Morgan replied that tho neu
trality provisions only extended to the
three-mile limit, and not a place so dis
tant as Jamaica.
Fortifications of outlying possessions, he
said, wore constantly going on and the
good faith of no nation could be attacked
because of them.
During the controversy Senator Wol
cott asked several questions indicating his
opposition to the amendment, while Sena
tor Mason by the same course indicated
his opposition to the treaty without the
amendment. Neither of them, however,
made any affirmative statement.
At the close of Senator Morgan's speech
the Senate returned to the consideration
of legislative business, no one else being
prepared to speak r>n the treaty.
WASHINGTON. April s.â The naval ap
propriation bill was to-day reported to the
House by Acting Chairman Foss of the
Naval Committee. The amount carried
by the bill is $31,219,916. the largest ever
reported to the House from the Naval
Committee. Aside from this _the report
which accompanies the bill is remarkable
for its array of facts regarding sea power
the world over, foreign naval programmes
and the comparative strength of the na
vies of the powers, accompanied by col
ored charts showing the upbuilding of
various greai navies." ' : â¢
Under the head of "Naval Programme"
the report sets forth as follows as to new
ships:
For the purpose of further Increasing the
naval establishment of the United States the
committee recommends that the President be
authorized to have built by contract two sea
going coast line battleships carrying the heavi
est armor and most powerful ordnance for ves
sels of their class upon a trial displacement
cf about 13,500 ton* and to have the highest
practicable speed and greatest radius of action,
and to cost, exclusive of armor and armament
not exceeding $3,600,000 each: three armored
cruisers of about 13.000 tons trial displacement
carrying the heaviest armor and most powerful
ordnance for vessels of their class and to have
the highest practicable speed and greatest ra r
dlus of action, and to cost, exclusive of armor
and armament, not exceeding $4,250,000 each;
and three protected cruisers of about SOOO tons
trial displacement carrying the most powerful
ordnance for vessels of their class and to have
the highest speed compared with good cruising
qualities and great radius of action and to
cost, exclusive of armament, nipt exceeding
$:\BOO.OOO each. â¢ ,
The maximum cost of the ships herein au
thorized, exclusive of armor and armament,
will be $28.350. 000. This is the largest naval
programme ever submitted by the Committee
on Naval Affairs of the House and Is in ac
cord with the wishes and recommendations of
the Secretary of the Navy and Adirjrn' DewÂ»-v
nnd will, we believe, meet the just demands
of nubile sentiment. The past yeur in na\ul
construction has been marked by the most lib
eral naval programmes on the part of all for
eign nations. At the present time there lh
pending In the Reichstag of Germany a naval
bill which. If passpd. will Increase the tonnage
of the present German navy 422.WJ0 tons, a
larger tonnage than that of her present navy.
As to armor plate, the report tells of the
futile effort to secure armor at $300 and
$}'PI, and says:
The battleships Maine. Ohio and Missouri,
now In process of construction, require 7,3,*>9.42
tons of armor, or Â£453.45 for each vessel. It
Is believed by the committee that these battle :
ships of nearly 13.M0 tons displacement, the
largest In design which have ever been placed
by the Navy Department, should have the best
obtainable armor and accordingly your com
mittee recommends that the Secretary of the
Navy be authorized to contract for such armor
at a cost . not to exceed $545 per ton. The
best obtainable armor at the present time ia.
according to all naval authorities, the si
called Krupp armor, which Is, at least, and
has been so proven by ballistic tests, of 25
per cent greater efficiency than the Harvey
\zfi\ armor. Every ration in the world Is
using the Krupp armor to-day. - Your com
mittee believes that It is little short of dis
loyalty to recommend any other than the best
armor for these battleships to' be placed be
tween the bodies of our officers and men and
the bullets of the enemy.
Under the last naval appropriation act Con
gress authorized the construction of the three
battleshipsâ Georgia. Pennsylvania and New
Jersey, and three armored cruisersâ West Vir
ginia, Nebraska and California, "but inserted
a provision therein as follows:
"That no contracts for the armor for any
vessel authorized by this act shall be made
at a rate exceeding $300 per ton of 2240 pounds,
including royalties, and In no casÂ« shall a
contract be made for the construction of the
hull of any vessel authorized by this act until
a contract ha* been made for the armor of
such vessel."
Your committee recommends that this re
striction be removed and the contracts he
authorized no that the construction of the hulls
of these vessels may go on without further
delay.
One of the most Interesting features of
the report is that which discusses "Our
naval policy." It gives the gradual up
building of our new navy year by year
under Secretaries Chandler. Whitney,
Tracy, Herbert and Long, and says:
We have a navy to-day which Includes a
considerable number of vessels of every class
and. shlf> for ship. It will equal that of any
navy In the world.
Seventeen years ajto we had practically no
facilities for building ships and what we had
were discredited. VVe were obliged to buy our
armament and armor and even in one case
our plans from foreign countries. To-day we
are not only building: ships in American ship
yards, of American material, by American
labor, on American plans for ourselvef, but
also for some of the leading nations fit the
world. Such has been the advance which has
been made In naval progress in our country.
The question may be asked what shall be
our future naval policy. Let us build as we
have been buildingâ gradually, on broad lines,
and upon the most advanced Ideas of naval

Cluverius sailed for Manila on a Govern

Miss Sampson is the third child of the
admiral and a very charming, sensible
girl. Her mother doubted the truth of
the engagement when It was first an

had been agreed between the young
people to keep it a secret. To settle the
matter she telegr^ihed to her daughter,
who was then at and received
a reply that the story was true. "

James Hurst, a San Francisco Hack

Habeas Corpus.
Special Dlspitch to The Can.
REDWOOD CITY. April 6.â Judge Lorl
gan of San Jose, sitting for Judge Buck
in this city, this morning heard arguments
in the Hurst habeas corpus proceedings
and took the matter under advisement.
James Hurst, the petitioner, Is engaged
in the livery business in San Francisco,
and also rents out hacks. He was ar
rested for running a hack in San Mateo
County without a license, although the
vehicle was licensed in San Francisco. A
fine of $100 was Imposed upon him. and he
refuses to pay this and applies for a ha
beas corpus writ to secure his discharge.
In his application for the writ he states
thai his place of business is San Fran
cisco and not in San Mateo County: that
the hacks complained of were hired in
San Francisco and conveyed people to and
from a cemetery in San Mateo County
without doing any direct business in San
Mateo County. He claims that as he
never had. a place of business in San Ma
teo County nor rented hacks to persons
across the line it is not necessary for him
to take out a license.
A decision on the case Is anxiously
awaited, as it will affect almost every
hack owner in San Francisco.

CANAL TREATY
DISCUSSED BY
THE SENSTE
Three Hours Spent on the
Subject of Forti
fications.
Davis Supports the Hay-Pauncefote
Agreement, Saying Neutrality ,
Is the Best Plan for This
Country.
WASHINGTON, April &.â On motion of
Senator Davis the Senate to-day con
sidered the Hay-Pauncefote treaty for the
modification of the Clayton-Bulwer
treaty. About three hours were spent in
discussion of the amendment to the
treaty made by the Senate Committee on
Foreign Relations, providing . that "none
of the conditions and stipulations 4n sec
tions 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 cf article II shall
apply to measures which the United
States may find it necessary to take for
securing by its own forces the defense
of the United States and the maintenance
of public order."
Senator Davis opened the debate with
a general statement in support of the.
treaty, but devoted his remarks espe
cially toward the explanation of the com
mittee amendment. He stated that In all
other essential respects the pending
treaty was similar to the treaty of Con
stantinople, entered into in connection
with the Suez canal. For some reason,
however, the provision permitting the
United States to defend its property*was
omitted. In the Suez canal treaty such
a provision was inserted in the interest of
the Sultan of Turkey and the Khedive of
Egypt. This omission was a palpable er
ror Mr Davis said, and he =did not be
lieve that the people of the United States
would be satisned with any arrangement
which left the Government of this coun
try to build a waterway between the
oceans and not give it the right in specific
terms to defend it. --i- "Â¦ .
Senator Morgan, the only member of
the Committee on Foreign Relations who
did not concur in the amendment, made
the principal speech* in opposition to it.
He consumed the greater part of the ex
ecutive session. Mr. Davis' speech being
comparatively brief. Before Mr. Morgan
began, however, a few brief statements
were made for and against the amend
ment. Senator Platt of Connecticut and
Senator Stewart of Nevada both came out
against the amendment. Mr. Platt made
the point that the amendment was un
necessary â¢ and therefore undesirable.
Senator Lodge made a brief plea for the
amendment, saying that however great
the present confidence was in the power
of neutrality and mutual understanding
among nations, we should take into con
sideration the possibility of the future
entanglements and lose no opportunity to
make provisions for safeguarding our in
terests in all exigencies that might arise.
Senator Morgan's speech was a plea
for neutrality as the best guar
antee of the safety and useful
ness of the canal. He said It was
to be a highway for the commerce of the
nations and that the proposed amendment
not only would fail to provide for its pro
tection, but might be the means of caus
ing complications which never could arise
If the amendment were not inserted. The
conditions, he contended, were entirely
dissimilar from ihose connected with the
Suez canal, Turkey holding possessions In
the immediate vicinity of that canal, and
the United States having no such posses
sions within thousands of miles of the
proposed Nicaraguan canal. He therefore
thought the restrictions superfluous and
contended that it Indicated. a disposition
to grant to Great Britain powers over us
which that country did not attempt to as
sert. Furthermore, ho contended that if
this amendment was inserted it would re
quire not only fortifications and the main
tenance of troops at probably both ends
of the canal, but also the maintenance of
battle-shlpH, coaling stations and supply
depots in that vicinity. The provision was
calculated in times of emergency to make
the termini of tho canal great battle
grounds and to invite complications -with
other nations, which would be avoided Jn
casp of the maintenance of absolute neu
trality. He contended also against the
adoption of the amendment as a precau
tionary me.vure, arguing that in case of
war we would take possession of the
canal without any previous agreement to
that effect.
"If," he said, "I should get Into a fisti
cuff with another fellow and he should
strike me.l would certainly strike back
without stopping to read any previous
agreement that I might have with my an
tagonist to the contrary. ; In case of a
war we would most certainly assume that
the other nation to the controversy had
broken the agreement and act accord

French Papers Unite in Denouncing

COPENHAGEN, April s.â The Prince of
Wales and his party arrived here at 8
p. m. to-day.
BRUSSELS, April s.â Jean Baptlste
Sipido. the Belgian youth who attempted
the life of the Prince of Wales yesterday,
was not submitted to any further examin
ation to-day. His attitude Is dejected and
he appears very tired, having had little
sleep. He expressed no regret for his
crime, but has requested permission to see
his mother. No interview between them
will be allowed for some days.
Late this afternoon the examining mag
istrate decided to confront Sipido with his
father and a touching scene ensued. But
It is said Sipido paid no attention to his
father's appeals, maintaining his previous
declarations.
In the Senate to-day the President, the
Duke of Ursal, expressed his reprobation
and indignation at the attempt on the life
of the Prince of Wales. Ho said:
"I give thanks to heaven that the heir
to the British throne has escaped the bul
lets of an irresponsible boy."
The remarks of the President were
greeted with applause.
The Premier, M. de Smet de Nayer, in
dorsed this speech.
The Patriot says: "Investigation proves
premeditation. The interrogation of the
prisoner lasted four hours, and it shows
that he was instigated by an unknown
person, who persuaded him to buy a pis
tol on Sunday in the Old Market for three
francs. Accompanied by this person
Sipido went on Tuesday to a meeting in'
the Flemish Theater and then to the Mai
son dv Peuple, where they had drinks.
Then they went to a wine shop, where
Sipido wrote a letter saying he had ob
tained employment. He then went to the
railway station and asked the hour of the
arrival of the train. Later he entered a
neighboring cafe and loaded his revolver
In the lavatory. Sipido refused to give
the name of his companion, who, he said,
was a young man some years older than
himself. After Sipido was locked up the
magistrate went to the house of his
parents."
According to the Etoile Beige, Sipido
explained his motive as follows: "For a
long time I have thought that the ambi
tious men who are unchaining war sacri
fice so many human lives that they de
serve to be punished. Those men should
suffer the penalty of retaliation. When
I learned by the papers that the Prince
was going to pass through Brussels I im
mediately resolved to become the avenger
of humanity and to kill this assassin. On
Sunday I went to the Old Market and
bought a second-hand revolver and car
tridges. I hod then made up my mind
to carry out my project. I regret that I
have not accomplished it as I desired."
PARIS. April s.â President Loubet has
sent an officer of his household to the
British Embassador, Sir Edmund J. Mon
son, to express his keen indignation at the
attempt on the life of the Prince of
Wales and to ask the. Embassador to
transmit to the Prince the President's
congratulations on the happy escape of
his Royal Highness.
The French papers unanimously de
nounce Sipldo's attempt on the life of the
Prince of Wales as a detestable crime and
declare Englishmen must not hold "Eu
rope's feeling of indignation against Great
Britain's policy in South Africa responsi
ble for Iho cowardly, act of a demented
anarchist."
LONDON, April s.â Congratulations on
the escape of the Prince of Wales from
death at the hands of Sipido, the would
be assassin at Brussels, continue to ar

from all quarters of the globe. All the

P^cclal DiFralch to Tb* Call.
NT.W YORK. April sâ There are rumorsT
of a widening breach between the Hunt-
Ir.gton and Bpeyer interests in the South
ern Pacific The stock market plans of
the Speyor contingent have not worked
Fmoothly, because, it is asserted, obstacles
have been placed in their path by Hunt
ir.riori ar.d some of his friends. Speyer.
has not been able to reach Huntington in
Kan Frar.c'.sco. Ir appears that a fort
night ago the Bpeyer contingent started
in to advance Southern Pacific's price,
havlns; arranged a strong pool for that
pnrx>osÂ». But when it got the stock
around 42 the pool found that it was get
â¢tinp entirely* too much stock. Investiga
tion showed that certain ipsMe interests
v.ere marketing big blocks of stock, which
they had acquired prior to the time the
books of the company closed for the an
nual meeting, which was held yesterday.
Mr. Speyer tried to convince thes<> in
terests that by holding off while his pooj
worked they would be able to get much
better prices for their stock, and thinking
that he had puccecded in this he
Irgan again to push stock up,
but selling of the same persist
ent sort came into evidence when
Southern Pacific got around 43, and since
then there has been steady liquidation
that has taxed the pool's resources. Yes
terday stock sold below 40. Part of the
stock sold has come indirectly from Hunt
ington himself, who, since the closing of
the books, has been desirous of marketing
a block of shares which he acquired be
fore that time. When Southern Pacific
was selling at 42 Mr. Huntlr.gton gave to Â¦
pome of his friends in the management an
option on large lots of stock as low as 40.
< >ne cf these blocks contained 3*),000
shares. It was partly this stock which
the Sr>ever nool was obliged to buy.

OSMAN PASHA, HERO

CONSTANTINOPLE, April s.â Ghazl
Osman Nubar Pasha, the hero of Plevna,
died yesterday evening, although the re
cent improvement in his condition led to
hopes of his recovery. He was born in
1532.
It will be remembered that Osman
Pasha was reported dead a fortnight ago,
his illness at that time having become so
serious that some of his attendants were
led to believe his life' ended. Later he
seemed to be progressing toward recov

evidently not justified.

SEATING OF
QUAY WOULD SET
BAD PRECEDENT
RAD PRECEDENT
Gallinger Makes a Long
Argument Before the
Senate.
Platt, Speaking as Chairman, Says
the Cubans Generally Have Ut
most Confidence in the
United States.
Â»
"WASHINGTON. April s.â During to
day's comparatively brief open session of
the Senate Galllnger of Ohio presented an
argument against the seating of M. S.
Quay as a Senator from Pennsylvania. He
devoted himself almost entirely to the
constitutional phases of the question.
Most of the day was spent in executive
session.
Platt of Connecticut, speaking as chair
man of the Senate Committee on Cuba,
said that there was nobody so far as he
knew who proposed to break faith with
the Cubans. "And I do not believe," he
added, "there are many Cubans who be
lieve the United States will not keep its
promise. Of course there are agitators in
Cuba, but among the Cubans generally
there is the utmost confidence in the
United States."
Gallinger of New Hampshire then pre
sented a constitutional argument against
the seating of Quay. He maintained that
the Governor of Pennsylvania ought to
have called a special session of the Legis
lature to elect a Senator after it had ad
journed without an election. He said he
opposed the seating of Quay because such
action would be a violation of both the
letter and the spirit of the constitution;
because he was opposed to giving the
Governor absolute right to make appoint
ments of Senators in any circumstances:
because the Legislature, having adjourned
without election, had voluntarily relin
quished a part of its representation in the
Senate, and because it would introduce
into our institutions a Pandora's box,
causing endless confusion in Legislatures
of the States.
The Senate then passed a bill to extend
the act governing the immediate transpor
tation of dutiable merchandise without
appraisement to- the ports of Laredo,
Eagle Pass and El Paso, after which at
1:30 p. m. the Senate went into executive
session until 4:40. when the Alaskan Civil
Code bill was laid before the Senate. Some
formal amendments were about to be pro
ceeded with when on motion of Pettus of
Alabama the Senate at 4:45 p. m. ad
journed. ,
Engineer McNeill. slightly injured.
Fireman Dubbs. slightly injured.
At the time of the accident the train
was running at full speed when It struck
a defect in the track caused by a partial
washout. The entire train was ditched,
the cars being piled in a heap. To add to
the horrors of the wreck fire started In
the debris, consuming the entire mass of
wrecked cars. Many passengers who man
aged to extricate themselves were badly
burned. Mail Clerk John F. Dane of
Denver was buried beneath the mass of
wreckage and was burned to death. John
J. Kuniz, a passenger, also lost his life.
It was reported that Express Messenger
J. B. Chapman was killed, but later re
ports say he is safe.
The loss to the railroad company will be
heavy, as the entire train was burned.

THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL,, FRIDAY, APRIL 6, 1900.
IMPORTANT
AMENDMENTS TO
HAWAIIAN BILL
House Unable to Take a Vote
When the Hour Was
Reached.
All Labor Contracts in the Islands
Are to Be Annulled and the
Amount of Land Held by
Corporations Limited.
WASHINGTON, April s.â The House
did not finish the bill to provide Terri
torial government for Hawaii to-day.
"When the hour fixed for taking a vote,
4 o'clock, arrived, less than half the bill
had been covered, and so many amend
ments remained that it was agreed to
conclude the consideration of the bill un
der the five-minute rule until it was fin
ished. Several important amendments
were agreed to to-day, among them the
following: ; * Â¦''
To nullify all labor contracts in the Isl
ands; to extend the alien contract labor
laws to the islands; to prohibit the sale of
intoxicating liquors in saloons; to limit
the land holdings of corporations to 1000
acres, and to substitute for the House
provision relating to the appointment of
Judges and other officers of the islands the
Senate provision. The House provision
lodged the appointing power in the Gov
ernor; the Senate placed it in the Presi
dent.
Pugh of Kentucky moved to strike out
the provision requiring that voters should
be able to speak, read and write the Eng
lish or Hawaiian language. It was lost.
Underwood taunted the Republicans
with their inconsistency in recognizing the
necessity for white man rule in Hawaii in
the pending bill while denouncing at
every opportunity the election laws of
some of the Southern States, which were
designed to prevent the participation in
elections of the ignorant and worthless.
On motion of Shafroth of Colorado the
Senate provision lodging the appointment
of the Judsres and other officers in the
President instead of the Governor was
substituted for the House provision.
Without finishing the bill the House, at
5:20 p. m., adjourned.

SHIPPERS WILL
OPPOSE MAKING
HOME SUB-PORT
Business Mtn of San Fran
cisco Denounce Scheme
in Strong Terms.
N'omeas a subport of entry Is a propo
sition that has thoroughly angered the
local business community. The general
verdict of the merchants if that to make
the proposed subport would ho to deal the
American shipping interests of the coast
i anil also the American commercial inter-
I esls. from Vug-t Sound southward, a se
vere blow. I^-aUir.g shipping men con
cerned In the Alaskan trade were inter
' viewed yesterday. Captain Edwin Goodall
[of the Paclflc Coast BteamsbTp* Company
i epoke indignantly of the proposition:
"All Am<!rican business interests must
'protest." said he. '^There is nothing to t
! scheme except an attempt t<> favor British
: shipping men as against the interests of
i the citteens of the United States. It is
! sublime cheek: no other phrase will dc
' fx-rU-.- it. San Francisco would be badly
i hurl as a point for shipping freights and
i selling goods to Cape Nome. N<> Amerl
i can Interest culls for the establishment or
i tha subport. Only British shipowners are
I asking for the change. Seattle would be
| injured. Cheap British ships would ,ure
Â¦ business across tbe Sound trom beattl-Â».
i People would leave Seattle to take ship at
; Vancouver or Victoria. Tbe proposition is
i outrageous."
J Marsden. vice president of the Kim
i ball Steamship Company, said: "To make
! the proposed mbport would destroy tbe
i protection that the existing coastwise r-g
1 ulnti.ms give to Americai! shippers. Now
j foreign ships cannot take freights Jrom
' ;in American port to an American port
under the cast trade regulations. If
' Nome should be made a subport the exist
! ing protection fo afforded would be lost.
i Then- are American ships enough to carry
i th" freight and passengers. Still there is
thi< way to look at the matter, that if
j there were a short age. that would be a
i stimulus to the building of American ships
i whi!<- the coast w!f<-- regulations hold good.
i Every American shipping man is decidedly
i opposed to making Nome a subport."
I J N. IHbban' of the Alaska Exploration
Company and T. If. Hlgbee and A. T.

I Agent Evans in his ottice on Slitter street
yesterday to express similar ideas. Mr.
ICvans Mid that he had not found any one
in San I-!rancisco who favored the esta-b- -
i Ilshment of tbe subport at Nome and he

PENSION LIST
TO BE REVISED
BY THE CHIEF
Many Ineligible Officers Are
Cited to Appear Before
the Board.
The Betirement of Sergeant Avon
Severely Criticized in a Com
munication From a Citizen
of Oakland.
?
Chief of Police Sullivan was engaged
yesterday in carefully examining the list
of men whose names are enrolled on the
police pension list. Unless he is con
vinced that the men were retired for good
and sufficient reasons, he intends to ask
the Police Commissioners to order them
back into the ranks'.
The cas.e of ex-Captain Wright, who
was retired ' by the old board notwith
standing tnrtt he had been a member of
the department for enly elg'.it years, has
created considerable comment in police
circles. It was claimed at the time that
Wright wsu" physically disabled, but this
is denied by the men who were associated
with him. Wright's object in asking the
Commissioners for an indefinite leave of
absence was to visit the Philippine Isl
aods.
He expected to be appointed secretary
of the Philippine Commission and wanted
his pension to go to his wife. It is claim
ed by his friends that if he decided to
locate at the islands he intended to re
sign from the department.
At the next meeting of the board Chief
Sullivan will submit a oomplete list of the
men who are on tbe retired list, tacn
name will be taken up separately, and un
less the retired offlcer shows that he is
entitled to a pension under, the provision
of the charter he will be ordered back
into the ranks or suffer the humiliation
of bring summarily dismissed from the
department. r , ,

HONEY SAVED IF
CITY OWNED ITS
ELECTRIC PLANT
Supervisors' Committee on
Public Utilities So
Informed.
The Supervisors' Committee on Public
Utilities met last night to consider the
lighting of public streets entirely by elec
tricity. Chairman Reed stated that one
of the plans under consideration was the.
construction by the city of its own poles
and distributing system and the purchase
of the electric current from the lo.west
bidder.
Chief Electrician Hunt of the Indepen
dent Company, who last year had com
piled a report on the estimated cost of an
electric plant for lighting the. streets and
municipal buildings and the approximate
cost of operating the same, gave valuable
information to the committee. He said
the poles would cost $Â£0,000. lamps $?.0,000.
insulators, wires, etc., $110,000, plant for
public buildings $15,0001 total $2:50,0u0. Th*
cost to light public buildings would be
$2.*.000 annually, the street lamps costing
$H)4,250. It wits ascertained that the cost
of public lighting now is $384,000 per year,
and if the proposed plan is carried out a
saving of $130,750 annually could be ef
fected with a4O per cent better light. The
saving the first year would go far toward
paying the original cost of the plant.
Prince Poriiatowskl, president of the
Standard Electric Company, informed the
committee that it would not enter the field
of competition in this city until July, IWI,
when it will deliver direct to this city
12.0ix> horsepower - from the lilue l^akes
system. The company would only do a
wholesale business of supplying power,
and the city would be required to own a
complete distributing system.
Regarding the water question, which
was next taken up by the committee.
Prince Poniatowski stated that from 45,-
COO.OOO to 12T>.0<X>,000 gallons of water were
going to waiste daily in the Standard sys
tem and engineers were at work now with
a view to utilizing that amount for any
purpose demanded. The company owned
400 square miles of water sheds and 140
miles of pipe would 'be necessary to bring
the water direct to this city. To a ques
tion by Reed whether the company was
willing. to sell the title of the system, re
serving the right to the power developed
by the water. Ponlatowski replied that the
shareholders of the concern would have to
be consulted, but he admitted that thu
water would' eventually have to come
down the coast. " ..;; j
ciety will be given in the First Raptist
Church; .120 Eddy street, this evening. The
programme will consist of readings by
Mrs. E. A. Woods. Scotch Bonga by
George St. J. Bremner. recitations by Dr.
Shiels, piano solo by Miss Jacob and violin
solo by Miss Alice Woods. Refreshments
will be served.
Strikers Give Up Their Fight.
Kurtz & Co.'s shoo factory. 103 Mission
street, has practically won its fight with
its striking employes. Two unions, the
lasters and the shoeworkers, walked out
three weeks ago because certain men had
been discharged, notwithstanding the pro
test of their fellow employes. A week ago
the shot-workers held a meeting and de
cided to give up the struggle. They ac
knowledged the right of the proprietors to
employ and discharge whomesoever they
plpased. About eighteen lasters and shoe
workers are still holding out, but it is
probable they will submit to the inevi
tablp.

WHY WEBSTER WILL NOT
SIGN JANITORS' DEMANDS
He Informs School Board That His
' Reasons Are Backed by Supremo
Court Decisions.
Superintendent of Schools Webster yes
terday sent a communication to the Board
of Education In which he specifies his rea
sons for not signing the school Janitors
demands for March. He contends that,
being employes of the Board of Public
Works the Janitors should not be paid out
of the 'school fund, and that there is no
authority under the charter or general
law for their payment in that manner.

SUPERVISORS Tobln, Helms and
Reed, composing the Police Com
mittee, were unable yesterday to
agree upon one of several or
dinances intended to prohibit pool
selling on every form of sport except
on horse races. After a long discus
sion, in which Mayor Phelan strongly op
posed the plan to legalize gambling within
the lnelosuro of a racetrack, the commit
tee came to the conclusion that it could
not make a recommendation at the next
meeting of the board, and it is highly
probable that the proposed ordinances
will die a natural death.
Supervisor McCarthy addressed the
committee in behalf of his ordinance by
which betting In the downtown poolrooms
was to be entirely abolished and a mo
nopoly of the gambling presented to the
racetrack vultures for a period of fifty
days in one year. He contended that of
the total damage to the community
caused by pool-selling only a small per
centage whh due to racetrack gambling.
To this assertion Mayor Phelan replied
pointedly:
"It has been ascertained thnt most of
th" embezzling, murders, defalcations and
other crimes are directly traceable to the
racetrack. Merchants have informed me
that they feel the pinch of the money
going out of legitimate trade. Why can
we not have sport without betting? There
is no reason why people should get rich
illegitimately at the expense of the com
munity."
Reed Insisted that no ordinance to pre
vent pool selling could be made effective
unless It was made a penalty to visit the
poolrooms.
"There Is an order in existence now,"
said Reed, "prohibiting , the selling of
pools on horses and dogs. If another is
presented rept-alinp it. the Mayor wonld
no doubt exercise his veto power."
Helms' order to license horse racing for
sixty day!*- and the one introduced by
Reed, allowing pool-selling on boxing con
tests i-xcept t>y paris mutuels, were also
Shelved for the time being.
The order introduced at the sug-Rpstion
of Chief of Police Sullivan prohibiting
lotteries and tile publication thereof was
recommended fur favorable passage.
The license of hotel solicitors and run
ners was fixed at $15 per quarter. A dele
gation of hotel keepers asked for a lower
mte for their bus drivers, but the request
was denied.

GRAND LODGE
OF WORKMEN
ENDS SESSION
C. T. Spencer of Magnolia
Lodge Is Elected Grand
Recorder. :
Prospect of a Wholesale Change in
the Grand Lodge Office in This
City â The Women Therein
Must Go.
At the session of the Grand Lodge of the
Ancient Order of United Workmen yester
day the odds and ends of the session were
taken up and disposed of. The principal
business was the rejection of the proposi
tion to rearrange the classified assess
ments so that there shall not be any odd
cents such as 2G or 56, but that they
should be 25 and 55.
The Grand Lodge reimbursed Placer
vllle Lodge In the sum of $254, sent by
check In payment of assessments and
which was loat in transit,
j | In the afternoon came the event of the
session, the election of grand officers.
Chas. E. Snook of Oakland, the grand
foreman, was by acclamation advanced to
the office of grand master workman. Dr.
\V. E. D. Monson of Los Angeles, the
grand overseer, was also by acclamation
advanced to the office of grand foreman.
For grand overseer there were three can
didatesâE. A. Freeman of Amador, Al. J.
Blackman and C. E. Curtis of this city.
Freeman was elected on the first 'ballet.
For grand recorder there were but three
candidates, Frank S. Poland, who has
filled the office for two years, having his
name withdrawn at his own request. The
nominees were D. S. Hirshburg. ex-grand
recorder, a member of Oak I^eaf Lodge of
Oakland; C. . T. Spencer of Mignolla
Lodge of this city, and Thomas H.
Carr of Nevada Lodge, Nevada City.
On the first ballot 175 votes were re
quired for election: Hirshburg re
ceived 117. Spencer 128 and Carr 104. On
the second ballot Hlrshberg received 112.
Spencer 141' and Carr S3. According to
rule. Carr. being the lowest, was dropped
On the third ballot the vote stood Hirsh
berg 135, Spencer 184. Spencer having re
ceived a majority was declared elected.
This means a general change in the of
fice of the grand recorder, as Spencer, it
was announced during the session, pro
posed in case of election to remove the
young women who for years have been
employed as clerks there nnd .replace
them by male clerks, members of the or
der.
During the session on Wednesday a
statement was made which seemed to
carry out that idea, and Past Grand Mas
ter Vlnter declared that when he was
grand master he was Importuned to such I
a degree to remove the lady clerks, who
are paid from fcss to $50 a month, that he
did so, replacing thmrvwlth n p+ ?"" n
month, and that after a trial of two
months he discovered that tney- uid n U i
do by one-third as much as the lady
clerks did, and he returned the women to
their . former, positions.
At the evening session Sam Booth was
ie-elected grand receiver, Dr. Mayon was (

ERNESTO BALUANZA Is dead.
The tenor who twelve years ago
charmed all who heard him in
the support of the great Pattl
passed away on Wednesday. Alone,
uncared for. In a little room at 333
Geary street, the end came. A few
weeks ago Baldanza came to town,
and on the strength of his old-time
reputation secured an engagement at
the Oberon. He Immediately set about
to stir up his fellow-countrymen In
the name of the musical muse and or
ganized a choral society which he
called the Italian Philharmonic Club.
J. Musso was elected president of the
new musical organization and Bal
danza retained for himself the posi
tion of leader.
On Sunday evening Baldanza sang
for the laft time. He was taken with
a chill after his performance at' the
music hall and took to his bed, never -
to rise again. The cause of his death
was acute bronchitis.
Baldanza leaves a widow, who was
formerly a Miss Trombley of Chicago.
She is now at the family home In De
troit, Mich., and the'news of the death
of her husband was wired to her on
Wednesday* The great tenor's home .
life was a most romantic one. After
his great success with Patti Baldanza
began to fall. Years crept on apace
and from nrst-class organizations the
r-inger slid down to cheaper attrac
tions, falling back on vocal lessons to
heYp make both ends meet. It was :
while teaching in Chicago that Bal
danza lost his heart to 'his pupil. Miss
Ernesto Baldanza.
Tromblejv Their marriage followed
and their union was the exception
that proves the rule which tells of
poverty and the flight of love.
On Sunday the remains of Baldanza
will find a last resting place in the
Italian Cemetery. The Italian Phil

of Its founder's burial and chant a
requiem over his grave.

the concern which is leading the fight against the Pacific Coast job
bers now on before the Interstate Commerce Commission, is convinced
that there is no place like California and no hospitality like that of

"San Francisco is to the Pacific Coast what New York is to the Atlantic.

most powerful commercial centers in the Union. No Eastern child is fully
educated until it has been given an opportunity to vlew'this wonderful coun
try, with all Its resources, wealth and generous, big-hearted people.
"While St. Louis is in somewhat of a commercial conflict with the Pacific
Coast there is no acrimony back of it, and the way In which we have been
treated out here cements a bond of friendship which should exist between the
Middle West and the Pacific Slope. Whatever way the contest goes it will

H. Schluckebler, who confesses that
IVtaluma is his home and admits that he
deals in everything from a windmill to a
paper of tacks, did not like the change In
the freight tariff that went into effect
in June, IS3S. His principal complaint
was that it forced him to deal on the Pa
cific Coast, when he had been in the habit
ol buying his goods east of the Rockies.
C. K. h reeman of Oakland, also a hard
ware dealer, testified along the same lines.
A San Jose merchant named A. K.
Holmes followed. His principal complaint
against the present tariff was that it
made his tacks cost him more than pre
viously and that they were a commodity
upon which he could not increase the
price to the consumer. Attorney Pillsbury
drew from him the Information that the
actual advance in the cost of tacks
amounted to less than one-quarter of a
cent a package when the new rates were
being made.
The St. Louis people Introduced W. C.
Andrews of San Jose as a witness for
their side of the question, but under skill
ful cross-examination by Attorney Pills
bury his testimony added strength to the
defense of the California jobbers.
Mr. Andrews admitted that he had en
tered into a compact in San Jose to keep
up the price of nails and sugar and that
he would still be with it if the "other
fellow" had stiuek to the agreement.
The Commissioners will resume the
hearing this morning, and expect to com
plete their labors here to-day.

WITH the amended shipping bill submitted to
the House on Saturday, General Grosvenor,
chairman of the Committee on Merchant
Marine and Fisheries, made an elaborate report on
the condition of the shipping industry of the United
States as compared with that of other nations, which
in a striking manner illustrates how far we have
lagged behind our competitors for the commerce of
the world, and how important it is that we should
at once adopt a wiser policy with respect to our ocean
interests. -tf^
Attention is directed to the rapidity with which
steam is supplanting sail power on ocean vessels.
The report says: "In sail Great Britain has declined
45 per cent since 1873-74; the United States has de
clined 40 per cent; Norway has remained station
ary; Italy has â¢declined 59, Germany 40, France 64,
and all other nations 26 per cent, the average for all
being the same as that for the United States. In
steam sea-going tonnage since 1873-74 there has
everywhere been an increase, the following percent
ages showing its magnitude: Great Britain, 311;
United States, 68; France, 200; Germany, 693;
Spain, 275; Italy. 395; Holland, 399; Russia, 430;
Norway, 1410; and all others, excepting Japan, 504.
Japan's statistics only go back one decade, during
which her increase has been 382 per cent. There was
an average increase in the sea-going steam tonnage of
all nations of 336 per cent since 1873-74. It appears,
then, that with our great population, industry, re
sources and enterprise, we stand at the very foot of
the column."
Owing to the lack of building ships rapidly enough
to keep pace with commerce, our share of our own
foreign carrying trade has diminished from a -little
over 26 per cent of the whole to less than g per- cent
during the last quarter of a century. Our average
annual construction of ocean steamships, most of
which are for the coastwise trade, for ten years past
has been only 21,000 tons, while the British annual
construction has averaged 968,000 tons.
The elements of cost of ocean transportation are
threeâ the cost of construction, the cost of mainte
nance and the cost of operating ships. Evidence *s
given in the report showing that ship construction in
Great Britain averages about 25 per cent lower than
in the United States. As to the cost of operation the
report says "that. the average wages paid to Ameri
can seamen on sailing vessels crossing the Atlantic is
$20, and to British seamen $14 per month; on long
voyages from the Pacific Coast to Great Britain
American wages were from $15 to $20/ and British
$12 15 to $14 58 per month, on such voyages Ameri-
Hoke Smith and his newspaper, the Atlanta Jour
nal, have parted company, and now we shall see
whether he made the paper or the paper made him.
Victoria's visit to Ireland as a compliment to Rob
erts and the Irish soldiers who have distinguished
themselves'in the South African war is undoubtedly
a well meaning act, but the Irish would like it better
if she had decided to take her foot off Ireland alto
gether and keep her hands out of its business.
can boatswains receiving $22 to $25 and the British
from $19 44 to* s24 30. So that it appears on the whole
the British wages on sailing vessels were somewhat
less than thrÂ»e-fourths the American wages. On pas
senger steamships in the transatlantic trade seaman's
wages in American vessels were only slightly larger,
but for other portions of the crew, such as firemen,
trimmers, coal passers, etc., the American wages were
$40, the British average being just about one-half the
American pay."
In addition to the advantages of cheap construc
tion and cheap wages, the foreign ship-owners are
aided by large subsidies from their Governments. In
the aggregate these foreign subsidies amount an
nually to more than $26,000,000. Against such fa
vored competitors it is of course impossible for our
shipping interests to maintain themselves, and as a
result our trade is now dependent upon the vessels
of our competitors. We cannot expect foreign ship
owners or foreign captains to extend our trade for
us. To find a market for our increasing products we
must provide ships of our own, and the sooner we
do so* the better will it be for us.
CONSTITUTIONAL VIGOR.
IN debating the Hawaiian bill the Democrats in
Congress have enlarged upon their contention that
all of our newly acquired external possessions are
automatically under the full constitution of the
United States.
De Armond 'of Missouri, who is regarded as the
leading lawyer of the House, on the Democratic side,
said "the constitution is in Hawaii ofits own vigor."
This backs Senator Jones of Arkansas, who said "the
treaty of Paris extended the constitution, with all its
immunities, privileges and blessings, to Porto Rico
and the Philippines."
When Colonel Bryan spoke at Sacramento, on the
26th of last month, over his head was a shield in
scribed, "The constitution follows the flag." In the
speech made under that shield Bryan said: "I
favored the ratification of the treaty of Paris not be
cause it was right, but because we could remedy its
faults by legislation better than we could by diplo
macy with a hostile nation." As a solution he pro
posed to let the Filipinos set up an independent gov
ernment.
Now let us look at all this for a moment. The
treaty put the flag in the Philippines, and Bryan ad
mits that he favored the treaty. Jones and De Ar
mond and the Bryan leaders say that the constitution
goes with the flag, and Bryan spoke with that
declaration over his head and in sight of his audience.
Will he or any member of his party tell us how ter
ritory once under the constitution can be got from
under it and alienated? Such territory has become a
part of the Union, as Senator Jones declares. There-
fore to alienate it is a dissolution of the Union.
Colonel Bryan says the faults of the treaty could be.
remedied by legislation. Â¦ Does he contend that when
the constitution, of its own vigor, or by any other
means, has extended over territory such territory can
secede by the act of its people or by legislative au
thority?
When we are dealing with constitutional questions
it rs well to remember that we are considering fun
damental law, not a repealable statute.
The secession issue rose in this country over this
very question. It was contended that territory that
had been under the constitution could secede. Against
this the Union party declared that the territory of the
Union was indissoluble. Upon the issue thus joined
the Civil War was fought, and by its result the de
cision was made, by a power higher than courts and
Congresses, that Federal territory is inalienable.
Now Mr. Bryan proposes by legislation to alienate
what Jones, Â»De Armond and himself declare to be
Federal territory, "entitled to all the rights, immuni
ties and blessings of the constitution."
It is plain that from his own view of the constitu
tion he proposes to dissolve the Union. After he has
legislated part of the Union out. what is to hinder
any part of it going? If the Philippines can go in
peace from the flag and the constitution, what answer
can be made if South Carolina and Mississippi claim
the right to go also, as they and all the South claimed
it in 1861?
It will be seen that the Bryan theory of the con
stitution is exactly that held and fought for by Jef
ferson Davis, and that under it there is no difference
between anti-expansion and secession.
It is expected by Colonel Bryan and his associates
that the Supreme Court will decide the Porto Rico
tariff to be unconstitutional, thus supporting their
theory. If the court so decide, and hold that these
islands are parts of the Federal Union, and Colonel
Bryan become President and his party legislate the
islands out of the Union, do they expect the Supreme
Court to decide such legislation constitutional? If
so, we demand to know on what grounds. Such a
decision would reverse the settlement of the Civil
War. and reopen the whole question again.
This position of Colonel Bryan and his party lead
ers is of. importance in view of his persistent bid for
the votes .of those who oppose expansion. The anti
expansionists are people of high intelligence, and they
see plainly that under the Bryan theory they have no
possible standing. If that theory be affirmed at the
polls, any reaction against expansion is a movement
to dissolve the Union.

THE SHIPPING INDUSTRY.
A GOOD SUGGESTION
TT~jOR the solution of the much discussed problem
J of improving our consular service the Boston
* Globe makes a suggestion which has the double
merit of originality and business sense. It proposes
that our representatives in the commercial centers of
the world be chosen from among the. men who have
distinguished*themselves in business as commercial
travelers, and in favor of the proposition advances
certain evidences of the usefulness of such men in
building up and expanding our foreign commerce.
Thus, it is said, "there is one American commer
cial traveler in South Africa who in . the past six
months has sold three shiploads -of our manufactured
goods in that country, and has written valuable letters
of advice to United States manufacturers, which will
enable them to make special goods for that market
and employ iooo hands in making furniture, hard
ware, glass and brass for prosperous towns in the
South African gold country, the war to the contrary
notwithstanding. Another went to Japan, and after
selling $150,000 worth of goods proceeded to India.
He writes that the British Consuls are the best in
formed Consuls abroad, and that they keep on file
nearly all the principal daily and trade papers of
Great Britain in" comfortable rooms, where native
merchants resort every steamer day to get the latest
news about British manufactures."
The suggestion is the more commendable because
just at this time a considerable number of able and
energetic commercial travelers have lost their posi
tions in domestic trade by reason, of the consolidation
of various business houses into trusts or combines.
These men. being now out of employment, are avail
able for the consular sen-ice. . As they have been
trained to the work of drumming up trade, and as
they are, moreover, fitted for it by natural inclination
and talent, it is evident they would be far more
valuable in the service than nine-tenths of the men
who have entered it solely as a means of getting- re
wards for political work.
; The suggestion is worth the attention of Chambers
of Commerce, Manufacturing Associations and other
bodies interested in the export trade, and if earnest
efforts be made they may procure the appointment of
many of these energetic commercial men to positions
abroad where they would work up a trade for Ameri
can goods of all kinds within a comparatively short
time. /

MUNICIPAL MORALITY.
/"^ RANTING the impossibility of the complete '
I ~~T extirpation of those vices which generate tn ]
citk?. including gambling, pool-selling and j
other allurements of chance, which impair the hon- j
esty and destroy the principles of their devotees, the ;
fact is indisputable that their repression is one of the |
duties of municipal government.
The decent people of this city demand, of right,
that every energy of their government be exened j
against dives, gilded or otherwise, whether above j
jrround or below, and against every form of gam- â¢
bling obnoxious to the law, and therefore the proper j
subject of government objection and destruction.
Ministers 01 the Gospel here and abroad have I
habitually declared that San hrancisco is the wicked
ftp*/ "trij
cst city in the country. That is only one way of sav
ing that it has the wickedest government, for these
flaunting or secret forms ot vice can exist only by
the collusion or indifference of the city government.
It is time that this sort of advertisement of this city
cease- It can be ended only by making it manifestly
untrue, and that is the duty of the government elected
by the people. We are perfectly well aware that.it
is said that the various classes which take a profit
out of vice and crime influence the election of our
public officers. But against that is set the fact that
decent people who do not profit out of crime and
would not, but who are losers by it. injured in many
ways by its presence, also influence the election of
public officers and would defeat any candidate who is
an ally of the criminal and vicious classes if they
knew of such alliance.
Government is for the clean and decent people who
live under it. not for the unclean and indecent, ex
rept to force them to obey the law and cease their
No one can dispute the proposition that it is within
tneipower ot the city government to besom from the
town all the classes and places that offend morality
and decency, and justify in any way the injurious
t-tstement of our morai status.
The city frovernment can run thi<= as a "wide open"
city or can compei its moral purgation. The great
majority of thi< community are moral, law abiding
and clean people. But their virtues are not consid
ered in comparison with the scarlet vices of the small
minority, who exist by fattening on the vicious and
the credulous. Virtue and order go their quiet way.
They are the normal state of the majority. Every day
they do those things approved of public policy and
good conscience, which are taken as a matter of
course.
But vice makes more stir by one manifestation than
virtue by a thousand quiet sets. It is not hard to
control the vicious minority. It can be swept out of
the city in a week, and the city -government has the
broom for the work. Let it be used.
EDUCATIONAL QUESTIONS.
WC. DOUB, Superintendent of Schools for
Kern County, has contributed to the discus
â¢ sion of public school problems in this State
a volume entitled "Educational Questions," in which
he reviews most of the issues now subjects of con
troversy among teachers. The chapters dealing with
the various topics are brief, and, as the author says
in his preface, "the discussions are short sometimes
even to bluntness, the object being to call the atten
tion .of the reader directly to the evil and to the
remedy, and to avoid bewildering the mind with de
tails."
The subjects of the work are: "The Certification
of Teachers." "Relation of the University to the
Cofirses of Study in the Elementary and Primary
Schools," "The Courses of Study in Elementary
Schools," "Grammar by the Inductive Method," and
"The State Textbook System."
Mr. Doub is one of those who are opposed to the
State textbook system. He says uniformity in the
textbooks of the State is good, and cheapness of the
textbook to the pupil is good, but a high quality of
subject matter in the textbook is absolutely essential
to good work; and he concludes that the State text
books are so deficient in quality that the defect more
than counterbalances all the benefits derived from uni
formity and cheapness. By way of remedy he sug
gests there should be a uniform series of textbooks
used in the elementary and secondary schools of the
State, but that all textbooks should be selected, not
written by contract, by the State Board of Educa
tion.
There is a danger that this remedy would result in
a change of schoolbooks every time the book ring
had a new work it wished to place on the market. It
would be urged by the ring that the new work is ud
to date and the old textbook a back number. There
would be about as many objections to the books in
use under that system as to those in use now, and the
frequency with which changes would be made would
add a good deal to the expense of parents in supply
ing their children with textbooks.
President Wheeler of the State University, in
speaking of his objections to the State textbook sys
tem, was careful to point out that in making any
change it would be necessary to guard carefully
against the book ring. By way of providing a safe
guard Mr. Doub would have the State Board of Edu
cation composed of the State Superintendent of Pub
lic Instruction, the president of the University of Cali
fornia, president of Stanford University, the profes
sor at the head of the department of education of
each of these universities, and the presidents of the
State Normal Schools. Of a Board of Education so
composed he says: "The majority will very likely
consist of men who cannot be swayed in their selec
tion of textbooks by favoritism or by monetary con
siderations." Thus his plan of getting rid of State
textbooks involves getting rid of the present form
of the State Board of Education, and to something
like a revolution in our school system.

of the negative. This being the case, of
course the first thing to decide on is which
is wanted, a "printing out" paper or a
developing out" paper. We shall con
sider a collodion "printing out" paper by
way of illustration. Such paper can be
obtained from any stock house In the
country. Before we begin printing It ia
necessar>- to have two or three printing
frames. These should be the same size
(interiors) as the negatives. The printing
frame la simply a shallow box with a
back nttirg in with two springs for press
ing it into close contact with thfi negative.
Place the negative in the frame with the
nlm side up or toward you. Now take
a shec-t of paper from the box it comes in
ar.d place the film side of the paper in
contact with the film ni the negative.
Place the back in the frame and press the
?prings Into position. The tilm side of the
paper is glossy and Is easily recognized.
Alter the negative and paper have been
placed in the frame they are ready for
printing. This should be * done in the
shade, or if done in the direct rays of the
sun one or two thicknesses of tissue paper
should cover the opening. If the tissue
paper is preferred all that 13 necessary
is to glue the tissue all around the frame
over the negatives and then place the
frame out on the window sill or shelf fac
ing the sun. If the printing is done in
the shade no tis3ue paper will he needed.
Go over the negatives very carefully with
a camel's hair dusting brush and remove
all du3t and lint lust before fixing nega
tive and paper in frame. The prints should
remain in the frame until they are about
two shades darker than wanted In the
finished print. They can be examined at
any time during the process by opening
half the frame. Care should be taken
not to allow a strontr light to strike the
paper when examining the print. Thft pic
tures will tone much lighter than they ap
pear when printed.
The next process Is that of tonina:. It la
In this process that the- pictures are given
their final lasting color. The first thing
to do in toning a collodion gloss print la
to get it into such a condition that It will
not curl. Take a smooth bottom tray and
pour into It water enough to cover the
bottom to a depth of about one-half Inch,
slide the prints into thia face down on*
at a time and pack them tightly one on
top of another all over the bottom of the
tray In an irreprilar mass. Be sure that
each print is thoroughly wet before plac
ing another on top of It and do not pile
the prints directly on top of each other,
but let only a part of one cover the one
beneath it. This will give an Irregular
heap and prevent their curling over each
other at the edges.
When all the prifits are In pour off the
water and pour on fresh water, about the
same quantity; rock the tray back and
forth for about five minutes, holding the
prints flat. This prevents the edpe of one
print from leaving a red streak on an
other print. After rockinp the tray pour
off the water and press the prints down
flat with the palm of the hand and allow
all the water to drain off, after which
stand the tray up on edsre and let the pic
tures drain for five minutes. Go throuph
thLs washing: process apain and acraln.
pivinff the prints at least six changes of
fresh water. The better way to do this
Is to have two washing: trays and to han
dle prints from one to another. The prints
are then ready for the toning bath, which
is made as follows:
Water : 80 ounces
Salt 30 grains
Saturated solution acetate soda. .H ounce
Aristo g-old 1 dram
Then add of a saturated solution of bo
rax enouph to turn red litmus paper blue
in about five minutes.
This bath should be roade and let stand
for several hours before used. Make It
onÂ© day and use It thÂ« next. Place th<*
prints In this bath one at a tlm*s and do
not put In more than can be easily attend
ed to or streaked tones may be the result.
It Fhould take about eipht minutes for
each print to tone In this bath. If It re-
Quires a lonper time add enough of the
gold to brlnp the speed of the bath up to
that point. TonÂ© In this bath until the
tone wanted has been reached, then take
out and place In clear water until all axe
toned.
After toning 1 Rive them two chantres of
fresh water, after which the pictures are
ready for the fixing bath. This consists
of hyposulphite of soda to test fifteen
pralns by the. hydrometer. Place all tho
prints into the bath one at a time and
leave them In it for fifteen minutes, when
they should be washed In running water
for one hour. They are then ready for
mounting.
Notesâ 1. Yellow whites indicate too
much borax in the TErold bath. 2. PlnK
whites show too little borax In the sold
bath. 3.. The baths, both pnld and hypo,
should bis at ft. temperature of about *v> de
prees. 4. The salt In the g"old bath is to
restrain the hi?h llsrhts ard prevent them
from overtoninp and allowing the shadows
and high lights to tone up evenly to
pether. .>. The pold Is the toninsr apent or
that which chancres the tone of the print.
6. The acetate of soda pives richer tones.
7. The red litmus paper spoken of for test
inp the pold bath 1Â«Â« a paper which will
chanpe to a blue if it is put into an alkali
solution. There Is also a blue litmus pa
per which will chanpe to a red if put Into
an add solution. Either color can be ob
tained from a stock dealer. Keep the two
in separate bottles, corked tightly, as air
affects them.

THE CALL'S
HOME STUDY CIRCLE
COURSE IN PHOTOGRAPHY FOR AMATEURS.
CALL IS ISSUED
BY REPUBLICANS
FOR CONVENTION
Executive Committee Adopts
; It and Recommends Its
Passage.
May 15th Agreed Upon for Holding
the Deliberations â State Com
mittee to Meet in Golden
Gate Hall To-Day.
The executive committee of the Repub
lican State Central Committee met at the
Palace yesterday afternoon and after
adopting a call to be recommended to the
convention which meets in Golden Gate
Hall to-day, it also set the 15th of May
as the date for holding the State Conven
tion.
When Vice Chairman George C. Pardee
called the meeting to order there were In
attendance E. F. Preston, Wendell East
on, Paris Kilburn, Colonel George Stone,
Isaac Upham, James Alva Watt, all of
this city, and W. F. Parker of Los An
geles and A. G. Gasson of San Diego. In
calling the members to order Dr. Pardee
stated that the meeting was for the pur
pose of preparing such recommendations
as the executive committee might see fit
to place before the general committee
which meets in convention at 1 o'clock to
day.
A general discussion ensued between the
members on the question of apportion
ment and the recommendations to be
made on that point to the convention, and
also on the question of the appointment
of a State Central Committee. On the
former question Secretary Steppacher
read some statistics which he had pre
pared, showing the number of dtueguies
each county was entitled to in the coming
convention. In discussing the appoint
ment of the new State Central Committee,
Mr. Preston thought it should be appoint
ed by the convention which will be in ses
sion on May 15, because the campaign will
commence on the Ist of July, when nomi
nations will be made and the new com
mittee can take up the fight at the proper
time. Many of the members of the com
mittee agreed with Mr. Preston, but ac
tion was deferred. It will probably be
discussed at to-day's convention.
Mr. Parker submitted the call, which he
said was in line with the call of the previ
ous convention. Mr. Preston read the
document and at the conclusion of the
reading Mr. Kilburn moved that It be rec
ommended to the general committee. Mr.
Preston said he thought it would be better
to recommend the time and place of hold
ing the convention. Mr. Parker expedited
matters by a motion to the effect that the
basis of representation Fhould be 1 in 300.
or a major fraction thereof, of the votes
cast for Governor Gage, in addition to
one delegate at large from each Assem
bly district. The motion was unanimously
carried. This will give 533 delegates to the
.convention.
Mr. Gasson moved that the convention
bo held on the 15th day of May. The mo
tion was adopted. The members also dis
cussed the place of holding the conven
tion, but it was agreed that it be left to
the general committee to pass upon. It is
probable that Sacramento will be chosen
for the convention city, although a num
ber of delegates are in favor of Santa
Cruz. Â«
Paris Kilburn renewed his motion to
have the call, as filled otit. adopted and
recommended to the State Committee at
its meeting to-day. It was carried. The
business of thf> committee having been
concluded It adjourned to meet in Golden
Gate Hall to-day at 1 o'clock. The call
Is as follows:
In accordance with the directions of the
Republican National Committee that dele
gated representatives of the Republican

The selection of the delegates of the Con
gressional convention shall be under the ex
clusive direction of the Congressional T"nm*
mittee of each district: provided thA the
basis of representation to said Congressional

IX.â THE TREATMENT OF NEGA
TIVES.
BY FELIX RAYMER
It will now be supposed that the result-
Ing negative has not come up Just as near
perfect as it should, so that a little "doc
toring" becomes necessary. There are
many Instances where the negative can
be improved. Sometimes everything i 3 all
right with the exception of one thins.
This being the case, it becomes a matter
of no little importance to know how to
help that one point. There is no photo
grapher who will claim that doctoring Is
as good for a negative as to get that nega
tive just right in the first place, but all
will agree that there are times when it be
comes a positive necessity to remedy some
trouble.
Let us first take up what is known as
Intensification. If the negative has not
been carried far enough in the developer,
or if too cool a developer has been used,
the picture on the glass will have a weak,
transparent appearance. The whole neg
ative has a faded appearance, and should
a print be made from It the print will be
weak and lifeless. This 13 the kind o*
negative that requires Intensifying. All
such negatives have plenty of time on the
exposure, but have not been carried far
enough in the developer. A negative that
is thin from under-exposure must not be
mistaken for a. negative that requires in
tensifying, for it would do no good to try
to work up a negative that has been un
der-exposed. In the case of the under
exposed negative it will be found that the
whites are very dark while the shadows
are perfectly transparent with no detail
in them. The intensifying solution should
be made up in two bottles, and about the
easiest to understand and handle Is made
as follows:
f Bichloride, of mercury. 60 grains.
â¢ A Â¦) Bromide of potassium, 60 grains.
I Water, â¬ !,3! ,3 ounces.
B J Sulphite soda, 1 ounce.
I Water, 4 ounces,
The negative should be washed for about
half an hour and then placed in a dish or
tray containing enough of the "A" solu
tion thoroughly to cover the negative. The
tray should be rucked back and forth until
every part of the negative has turned a
cream or milk color. Then take the nega
tive from the solution and rinse well, after
which place in another tray containing
enouga of the "B" solution to cover the
plate. Rock the tray back and forth until
all the milky appearance has disappeared
and the negative has returned to its for
mer color. It will be necessary now to
wash the negative again thoroughly. It
will now be seen that the whole appear
ance of the negative is more "snappy." If
the first trial does not intensify the nega
tive quite enough, a second trial may be
made, and a third, and so on until the re
quired intensity has been accomplished.
Atter intensifying, the negative should be
washed thoroughly about one hour, then
dried.
It sometimes happens that a negative
may be carried too far in the developing.
If this is the case the negative will look
too black all over when held up and ex
amined by light coming through it. If a
print be taken from this negative it will
require quite a long time to do the print
ing, and after the print Is made its ap
pearance will be anything but pleasing,
from the fact mat it will ha\-e a "snowy"
look. It will be necessary to reduce this
negative to a proper decree. For that
purpose the following solutions are used:
A J Ferrieyanide of potassium. 1 ounce.
\ Water. IS ounces.
B J Hyposulphite of soda, 1 ounc*.
( Water, 16 ounces.
Place the negative in a tray containing
enough of "B" to cover it well and add to
it a little at a time just a small quantity
of 'A." The more of -A" that is used the
fasver will be the reduction. Do not has
ten the work too rapidly, however, as
there is danger of going too far. Solution
"A" should have an opaque paper
wrapped about the bottle, as it is sensi
tive to the light. It is very necessary that
the plate should be washed thoroughly
after this treatment. Wash for at least
one hour in running water, or if changed
from one tray to another give it at least
twenty-five changes.
At times it is only beneficial to a nega
tive to be intensified or reduced locally â
that is, certain parts only require treat
ment. If such a negative is in hand the
treatment can be made while the negative
is wet with very satisfactory results.
Take a tuft of absorbent cotton and dip it
into the solution desired and touch only
those parts of the plate that need im
proving. Care must be exercised or an
irregular streak may show around the
place worked on.
Sometimes the negatives may be too
yellow. This is caused by not using
enough of the sulphite of soda in the de
veloper. To remedy this it will be nec
essary to clear them up with what is
known as the "clearing solution." One
might think this color in the negative
would make no difference, but it is quite a
drawback to getting, a good print. The
more yellow there is in the negative the
more of a chalky look there will be to the
print. This yellow cast in the negative is
sometimes caused by the water in which
it is washed being exceptionally impure.
A negative may be taken from the fixing
bath and have just the correct tone or
color and placed under a tap of impure
water to wash, and it will change color
in a very few moments. The clearing
solution is made as follows:
Water. 18 ounces.
Alum (pulverized). 1 ounce.
Sulphuric acid. 1 dram.
Place the negative in a tray and pour
over it the clearing solution and rock
back and forth for a few minutes, when
It will be found that the color will change
for the better. After clearing it will be
only necessary* to rinse the plate well,
when It may be hung up to dry.
When the negatives are dry it should
be the first care of the operator to go
over them carefully to see if they are
flawlessâ that is, to see if there are any
pinholes caused by dust which may have
by some accident not been removed from
the plate before exposure or before de
velopment. If it Is found that there are
pinholes they should be removed by the
use of a small camel's hair brush. They
are known .among artists as pencil
brushes. A No. 2 will be found to gtve
the best satisfaction for this purpose. The
agent to be used for removing or plugging
the pinholes is what is known as India
ink, and can be obtained either In a liquid
or in stick form. Start in by moistening
the end of the stick and rubbing a little
of it on the thumbnail. Nov.- take the
brush and dampen with saliva and work
in the ink on the nail until the proper con
sistency has been obtained (this will take
a little experience) and "dot"' the pin
hole. This must be done in such a way
that it will be of the same tone as the
surrounding parts of the negative. If it
is heavier it will make a white spot in the
print, which will have to be worked out.
If It is not quite so heavy it will print
darker than thÂ« surrounding parts. When
all such imperfections are rem/>ved the
negative should be varnished to prevent
scratching or rubbing. Almost any stcck
dea!er can furnish a good negative var
nish. To varnish the neefctive requires
considerable oaie. Take the plate in the
left hand as though going to examine It.
This will cause the lower left-hand corner
to be grasped. Take the bottle of varnish
in the right hand and holding the negative
on a level as near as possible pour the
varnish on the right upper corner, allow
ing it to flow slowly across to the left up
per corner and from there down to the
lower left corner, thence to the right cor
ner and off into the bottle again.
X.â PRINTING AND FINISHING.
BY FEIJX RAYMER.
One of the most puzzling things about
making pictures is to decide on what
printing paper to use. In view of the fact
that there are so marry different kind*
and brands on the market it would seem
to be almost a hopeless task, and more so
when we hear each manufacturer claim
ing his product to be the very best. It
might be said, however, that the "print
ing out" papersâ that Is, the paper that
the image is printed out to a full depth
and afterward toned to the proper color
are divided into two classes, viz.. collodion
and gelatin. The "developing out" papers
are those papers where the image is de
veloped out something like the developing
CORONER COLE MADE
THE WIDOW SMILE
Miss Addie Silva Told About Her
Relations With Suicide Arthur
G., Pereda.
Even the widow of the drowned Arthur
G. Pereda was obliged to Join in the smile
and the snicker that went around the
room yesterday, as a jovial testimonial to
the wit and humor of Coroner R. Beverly
Cole, sitting in request at the Morgue on
the dead body of her husband.
Pereda's body was discovered floating in
the bay near Goat Island last Wednesday
morning, two weeks after his disappear
ance. Among other things found on his
person was a note written by him in pen
cil and addressed to his brother Frank,
in which deceased regretted his marriage
of four months' duration and added: "Ad
die Silva is my wife."
Mrs. Carrie Pereda, widow of the dead
man, swore that the note was not in the
handwriting of her husband. She said
she did not know Addie Silva, and had
seen her only on one occasion and then at
a distance.
"Was she as good looking a woman as
you are?" asked the Coroner.
"No;" replied the widow, with a smile.
"I didn't see nothing in her face to get
stuck on."
-Of course,", hastily interjected the Cor
oner, "I don't mean to say that you are
good looking. I spoke merely as a matter
of comparison."
An offended frown succeeded the place
of the smile on the widow's face, and the
Coroner was in much disfavor thereafter.
Miss Silva was called to tell what she
knew of the deceased. She is a glove
maker, neat in dress and genteel in man
ner. She said Pereda had courted her for
three years; had asked her at the end of
that time to marry him and that she had
refused him. Three, weeks later he mar
ried the woman who is now his widow.
"You were as good as married to him,
wern't you?" aeked the Coroner, bluntly?
"No, sir," promptly replied the witness.
"Nothing of the kind."
Another witness, in telllngr about some
thing that occurred on the evening pre
vious at the late residence of Pereda, said
"a colored gentleman named Stewart was
there," whereupon the Coroner, whose
southern pride had been aroused, demand
ed sternly:
"Did you ever see a colored gentleman,
sir? There must have been a nice crowd
thereâ niggers, Mexicans and whites,
faugh!"
Miss Sllva, who had received many let
ters from the deceased during their three
years' courtship, swore positively that the
"note found on the body of Pereda was in
his handwriting.
The jury rendered a verdict of death by
asphyxiation by immersion in a manner
unknown to the jury.

Â»
The Oceanic Steamship Company's
M<>ana Jirrived from Sydney, N. S. \V., via
Auckland, New Zealand; Apia, Samoa,
and Honolulu, H. 1., "yesterday, a day
ahead of time. Owing to the reports of
bubonic plague in Sydney, N. S. W., the
steamer was placed in quarantine, and
the chances are that she will not be re
leased until to-morrow afternoon.
After a cursory inspection of the 209
passengers Dr. Kinyoun decided to send
the mail ashore, and later allowed the
New Zealand and Samoan passengers to
land. The mall boat only Etopped three
hours at Honolulu, and no passengers
were taken aboard there. At the Hawa
iian capital several cases of plague were
reported since the China left there, ac
cording to the New Zealand mail agent
who came ashore on the tug. Everything
was quiet in the islands, however, and it
was expected that the disease would be
stamped out in a few weeks more.
Dr. Solfe has taken office as governor
general of the German possessions in Sa
moa, and German officials .are now in
possession of all the offices in Apia. Malie
toa Tanu has retired into private life, and
such a thing as a native king will never
be heard of again in the islands.
The passengers who came up in the
cabin on the Moana were:

The new barkentine J. L. Evlston ar
rived from Coos Bay yesterday after a
fair run. She is ono of ;he strongest
vessels ever turned out of a shipyard on
the Pacific Coast. She was designed by
Captain C. H. . Ackerman, and her con
struction was superintended by Captain
Wirschuleit, who now commands the ves
sel. It was originally intended that Ca.p
tain Ackerman should be managing owner
of the vessel, but some dissensions arose
and Captain Charles Nelson will handle
her in the future. The principal owners
in the Eviston are Captain Charles Nel
son. Captain Ackerman, Lorenz Kord, J.
\j. EviFton (after whom the vessel is
named). 1,. Rone and Captain Charles
Hackus. The barkentine is 1"? fe^t long,
A<) feot beam, and 15 feet depth of hold.
She carries 900,000 feet of lumber.
The tine American ship Paramita. now
on her way from China to Puget Sound,
has been purchased by San Francisco par
ties and will go into the coast trade on
her arrival at Port Townst-nd. ' The prin
cipal men in the pyndirate who purchased
her are A. Anderson. Captain Charles
Backus, AY. Blum and Captain P. Gee.
The price paid Is said to have been
$.33,fiOQ. T^ewis. Anderson & Co. will be the
managing owners. The Paramita is 1444
ton? nt-t burden. 21(5 feet 6 inches long,
41 feet 3 inches beam ajid 23 feet deep.
She will be commanded by Captain
Charles Backus.
The managing ownership of the Eclipse
may once more vest in Lowis, Anderson
& Co. Sometime ago there was a dis
agreement among the shareholders, and
Kischen & Minor were made the manag
ing owners. A few days ago, however.
Captains Charles Backus, Charles Rock
and Charles Groper purchased shares in
the vessel, and. as they are all friendly
to I^ewis, Anderson & Co., the managing
ownership of the vessel will probably
change hands again at the end of the
ship's year.
Commencing April 22 the Sausallto fer
ry steamers will leave every evening at
5:15. 6:15 and 6:45 p. m., instead of at 5, 6
and 6:30 p. m.. as has been the custom
for years. There was quite an organized
fight against the change, and petitions
and counter petitions nave been flying
around Marin County for weeks. The fight
Is now over, however, and the hatchet is
buried. All travelers on the Sausallto
ferry will now have fifteen minutes longer
in San Francisco when the new schedule
goes into effect.
The bark Abby PaJmer arrived at
Adelaide. Australia, on the 3d inst. While
In h gale off Flatten,' this vessel had her
derkload of lumber washed overboard
and one of the crew was injured. She put
into San Pedro and landed the injured
man and then proceeded. The run across
was made in the good time of fifty-eight
days.
From English papers which arrived her*
a few days ago somÂ« particulars of the
stranding of the British ship Talus near
Dunbar. Scotland, have been received. She
went ashore February 20, and the captain
and crew were saved with some difficulty
by a Danish steamer. Captain Stenhouse
was accompanied by his wife and Infant
son. and all- three had a hard time of it.
Latest advices from Dunbar are to the
effect that the chances of getting the
Talus off are good, and that she will prob
ably be in San Francisco next year for a
load of grain. She left here- August 3 last,
and after discharging her wheat left Eng
land in ballast for Fredrickstadt. While

NEW YORK. April Â£.â "Hie mock market con
tinued !ts active and extremely irregular char
acter today. There wss some hesitation at
the ourset asd prof.t-taltir.g was on a large
Bca> during the oarly hours of the day, but
the argrewsive strength of some individual
etockr,. notably Pennsylvania and Baltimore
and Ohio, served to bus tain prices in face o*
realizing until the latter part of the day.
The market then devejrped unmistakable
ryn-iptoras of being over-bought and the pres
sure to se'.l in ordÂ»r to realize profits became
urpor.t. The reaction in Pennsylvania and
Baltimore and Ohio left prices without a sus
taining prop and they crumbled rapidly. The
Paclf.cK. the graxgtrs ani some of the South

the vrboia list fell easily and efforts to sup

fifteen minutes, but it recover^! only a Fmull

yesterday and carried the price a jxjir.t over

aroused uneasiness in tp!UÂ» cf the upward

Â«!> rushod up also to 87^ and proved unable

but they yielded fharj'ly on denials' of the

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, April s.â The opening of corn, was
easier because of the feeble attitude of Liver
pool and because there were many who looked
for a reaction. They repented later, for Liver
pool, which failed early to respond, took a
brace because of the spot firmness there.
Shorts covered, and boomed along by the big
outside business shot from first figures â 40vÂ»?f
4oft câ up to the top, 42c. The cash demand
here slackened very visibly and an abundance
of profit-seek Inc corn came Into the market
which receded to 40%@41c, at which price it
closed %@\ic under yesterday.
Signs in the wheat m-rirket early were all
bearishâ disappointing cables, fine weather and
a continued bear attitude on the part of the
local professionals. The corn strength and the
poor showing 01 Indiana and Ohio for the crop
caused a rally following the opening, but In
thiÂ» end the. bearish news, reinforced by re
ports of rapid seeding in the Northwest, over
shadowed other considerations and the rally
was lost. There was a b\g market, however,
and tjttp pit was well filled. The cash demand
was ftack, the exrort demand being put by
New York at five loads. May opened H(fz-Hc
down, .at ftS'^'SS^c, declined to 67',ic, rallied
to 6Sn, reacted to 66%ti67e, and closed ie under
yesterday at 67c.
Provisions were active. There was an excel
lent cash demand and a strong hog market,
but on the other hand there were important
realizing sales made by longs. Lard and ribs
closed hrm. but pork was rather weak. Large
export sales of lard over night were reported
early In the session, and the foreign demand
to-day was very fair. The opening to-day was
Irregular. May closed 22Vsu depressed, May

London Market.
NEW YORK. April s.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial .cablegram says:
The markets were stagnant and heavy through
out the session, still affected by the approach
ing holidays. Americans opened dull and
sagged all day. A few slight attempts were
made to rally them, but sellers always pre
ponderated until In â¢ the street, where a frac
tional recovery took place. The only hard
epots were Baltimore and Ohio, Central Pa
cific and Pennsylvania. Coppers got a set
back on profit-taking by both French and Eng
lish sellers. Tintos were 59H. Anacondas,
10 13-16. The Bank of England lost Â£100,000
gold to Argentina. Money was very easy and
the large sum due the Bank of England was
wholly repaid. Bills were a shade harder.
The Bank of England return showed note ex
pansion and bullion reduction due to the usual
quarterly movements. The reduction of public
deposits was due to disbursements. The re
duction of other securities was due to the
market's repayment of borrowings.

Special Dls>pntch to The L'aH.
WILLOWS. April s.â Thf> suit of Lady
vs. Potts, which has created a considera
ble Ptir in the community, came to an
abrupt close to-day. The case was
broupht against former Justice of the
Peace Potts to recover $147, claimed to be
due to Ludy from Potts for neclfct of
duty while actinp as Justice. In another
case, in which plaintiff lost the $147. thf>
plaintiff nlleses that Potts' newpence of
duty was the cause of his losing tho
money. The history of the case is very
unique in that it-has been in the hands of
every attorney in the county, besides a
few others, has gone through five Justice
courts and twice through the Superior
Court. To-day, at the close of the second
trial in the Superior Court. Judge Plrkey
refused to hear the argument or to give
any of the offered in-nrnetions. hut pre
pnred for and directed the jury to find a
verdict for the plaintiff.
The jury then retired, and after delib
erating for an hour returned with a ver
dict as directed. The action of the Judge
in this regard is said by attorneys here to
tin without precedent, as conflicting evi
dence was produced, and they declare the
Judge went beyond his authority. A
number of jurors said the verdict would
have been returned in favor of the de
fendant had It not been for the instruc
tions of the court.

CHINESE ARE CROWDING
OUT THE WHITES
Strong Effort Being Made by Wily
Celestials to Pravent White
Men Becoming Guide 3.
An effort i.< being made on the part of
the Chint-^e to prevent white g-uldv.o from
doing business in Chinatown. A petition
was circulated lust night by the Mongo
lian guides among the Chinese in whoso
places of business the principal attrac
tions are located, to b;sr Caucasians in ftie
same occupation. The obji-ct of this is
to force sightseers to employ the almond
eyed sons if they wish to gain the real
pleasure of a trip through Little china, as
the latter class of directors will be the
only ones to have free access to nil points
of int. rest.
The occasion of all the dissension amotif?
the guides is the recent decision of the
Police Commissioner* to reduce the num
ber of licenses and to make their issuance
df-pendont upon the moral character of the
applicant. For the past few days Ser
peant of Police James T. Donovan has
been detailed in the Chinese quarter ascer
taining the habits of those who have ap
plied for the privilege of renewing their
licenses, and largely upon his report will
the limited number of guides for the ensu
ing year be appointed.
The Chinese Ruides flndinj? their num
bers curtailed, immediately suspected that
their white brothers were responsible for
this condition and the petition which was
circulated last night was the result of
their spite.

INJURED IN A MINE.
Superintendent Holmes Badly Hurt
by Falling Rock.
ANGELS CAMP, April s.âSuperintend
ent Holmes of the Jones mine, near this
place, was caught in a cave-in in that
mine yesterday morning. He is reported
to be badly injured. Holmen and Fore
man Burke entered the mine before the
men went to work to sample the rock
on the 200-foot level. They went beyond
the last set of timbers. The rock began
to fall and the men started to go out.
A large quantity of rock fell at this time,
missing Burke and catching Holmes, cov
ering him completely with the exception
of his head.
Burke secured assistance and, after
strenuous efforts relieved Holmes from his
dangerous position, and none too soon, for
the men had hardly started to leave that
portion of the mine when twenty-five tons
of rock fell where the miners had been
working a few minutes before.

HOUSE CAUCUS ON THE
PORTO RICAN BILL
Agree That the Shortest Route to a
Termination Is to Concur in the
Senate Amendments.
WASHINGTON. April s.â The Republi
cans of the House in caucus to-night de
cided to take the shortest possible route
to a termination of the Porto Rican tariff
problem by concurring in all the Senate
amendments and sending the bill directly
to the President. There was a feeble pro
test from Cooper of Wisconsin, chair
man of the Insular Committee, and
Moody of Massachusetts, who favored
standing out against some of the feat
ures of the civil government scheme at
tached to the bill by the Senate. They
objected especially to the Senate provision
making all the members of the upper
council of the Porto Rican Legislature ap
pointees of the President and clothing
them with the power to grant franchises,
but tho sentiment of the caucus was over
whelmingly against them. None of the
Republicans who voted against the origi
nal House bill were present at the caucus
to-night. As soon as the Republicans ab
sent from Washington can be summoned
here, as early as Monday if possible, the
matter will be brought before the House
under a special rule.
Previous to the caucus the seven Re
publicans who opposed the original bili
(McCail of Massachusetts, Littlefleld of
Maine. Lorimer of Illinois. Crumpacker of
Indiana, Heatwole of Minnesota. Lane of
lowa and Warner of Illinois), held a con
ference and decided not to recede from
their former position. Consequently.
they considered it useless to attend tho
conference to-night.
QUEEN SPENDS A
QUIET DAY IN DUBLIN
Under Her Orders a Regiment of
Irish Foot Guards Will Be
Organized.
DUBLIN. April 6.â Queen Victoria's
first day of residence in Dublin passed
quite uneventfully. Such scenes as there
were might well have occurred In Lon
don.
The army orders yesterday contained
the following: "The Queen having deem
ed it desirable to commemorate the brav
ery shown by the Irish regiments in the
recent operations in South Africa has
been graciously pleased to command that
an Irish regiment of foot guards be form
ed under th<- designation of Irish Guards."
Neither the Freeman's Journal, the In
dependent nor the Irish Times comments
upon It this morning, hut the Express
says "it is a great and kindly compliment
to Ireland." und suggests that the guards
should be chiefly composed of the rem
nants of thf> Irish regiments which have
fought so valiantly in South Africa.
When the Queen went out driving this
afternoon without escort, carriages and
cabs and cars persisted in following li<t
and the policemen! after a few futile ef
forts, allowed this unusual procedure.
LEGISLATORS ACCUSED.
Massachusetts Normal School Girls
Say Committeemen Acted in an
Improper Manner.
Ppprlal Plppatrh tn The Call.
BOSTON, April 5.â A lively scandal has
just transpired at the Brldgewater State
Normal School for girls. Two young wo
men have written a letter to Boston news
papers to complain that recently while
the legislative committee on education,
in the absence of the superintendent, was
inspecting the institution at 9:30 in the
evening, two of" the younger members of
the committee wrnt outside the strict pro
prieties in songs and deportment.
The names of the men were not given by
the complainants. The other members of
the committee admit tlrÂ» misdeeds of the
two, but characterize them us a mere
foolish "indiscretion" not to be considered
seriously.
Every effort is being mane to hush up
the matter, but it is expected tiiat the
Legislature will be asked to investigate
the occurrence.
SHOT DURING A QUARREL.
John W. Smith Probably Fatally-
Injured by Thomas Hind.
Special Dispatch to Thr> Call.
LOMPOC. April s.â The second stage
from Santa Barbara last night brought in
John \V. Smith, who had been shot in the
neck by Thomas Hind. Smith was partly
under the influence of liquor when shot
and Is paralyzed from the wound. He is
unconscious and chances are greatly
against his recovery. Smith boarded the
stage at Gaviota and Hind at San JuHan
Ranch. Smith fell from the stage during
the trip and claimed Hind pushed him off,
but the driver says this Is not so. They
had some words over this, which resulted
in the shooting.

SANTA CRUZ, April ;..â The jury this
afternoon decided that Mrs. Clara L. Tib

Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO, April s.â The Owl train, north

BERNARD MOSES
RETURNS FROM
THE CAPITAL
Work of Philippine Commis
sion Outlined and Organ
ization Completed.
BERKELEY, April s.â Wofessor Ber
nard Moses of the University of Califor
nia, who was recently appointed to the
Philippine Commission, returned home
late last evening from Washington.! He
expressed himaelf as pleased with the ap
pointment und tho association with his
eminent colleagues. Professor Moses had
numerous official conferences with Presi
dent Mclvinley, whom he highly praises.
The policy of the administration regard
ing- the Philippines was dlsoussed ana the
work of the commission outlined. Pror'es
sor Moses said President McKinley was
anxious that a California man be elected
to the commission, as the State's future
prosperity will undoubtedly be influenced
by the Philippines. He would not discuss
the probable solution of the Philippine
question and would offer no suggestion as
to the policy to be followed.
"My instructions have not yet reached
me," said Professor Moses, "and it would
not be proper fur me to nay anything re
garding the commission's work. 1 had
numerous conferences with I'resident Mc-
Klnley and received instructions as to the
policy of the administration regarding the
handling of the Island question, but as
the conditions may be entirely opposite
two months hence from what they are
now nothing definite can be determined.
"The members of the commission met
and formally organized, Judgf Taft being
made its president: We did nothing but
complete the organization; that we may
be able to begin work immediately upon
our arrival in Manila. On tho 15th of this
month all the members will have arrived
ar.d th^n we will he ready to start for tho
islands. A month later we can begin
work. I suppose it will be part of our
scheme to look over the islands thor
oughly, consult with the most influential
men, receive final instructions from Pres
ident McKinley and then make our report
to the Government. What length of time
it will take I cannot, even speculate upon.
President McKinley by authority of his
military office hi'.s the entire Philippine
matter in his hands. I can say very 1 it
tl<? tit this time, as 1 know very little", and
developments must make themselves.'."
The Academic Council of the University
will tender a farewell banquet to Profes
sor Moses at the Palace Hotel in San
Francisco next week on the eve of his de
parture. The entire commission will be
tho guests of honor at a banquet given by
the Yale Alumni Association during their
stay in San Frnncinco.

little expected to ever see my home again,
ami it was only through the .bravery,
skill and determination of Colonel Hare
and his men that any of us came out
alive."
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
Ills Broadway, April 5.
BERKELEY Is the center of atten
tion from the liquor men and the
temperance forces of California.
The battle opened by the saloon
men against the prohibitory ordinance
has reached the Supreme Court of the
State, and both sides are awaiting with
interest the result of the biggest legal
struggle which has been made in the
Special counsel have been employed on
each side, and not only has there been a
direct attack upon the ordinance, but in
directly through an effort to have the Jus
tice Court of Uerkeley declared Illegal.
Th/> Supreme Court has taken a most
unusual course in the case which is now
before it. by ordering the attorneys to file
theii several briefs within twenty-five
days The customary tim<- has been seven
ty-live days. This, ls taken to mean that
the court has recognized the importance of
the issues involved. The law firm of Chap
man & Clift of thia city has the saloon
men's side, while Kox. Kellogg & Gray
are specially employed by the tomperanco
people.
The fight grows out of the action of the
temperance forces, represented by the
State Anti-Saloon League, centering at
Berkeley in a campaign to close the sa
loons. When they advanced the proposi
tion to the Berkeley Trustees they were
met by the fact that StvAi a year was de
rived from licenses from the saloons, and
that the town treasury would suffer that
loss if the ordinance were passed. Headed
by James 1* Harker and A. \V. Naylor,
the temperance people then made the
unique proposition that they would guar
antee payment into the town treasury of
the. revenue thus cut off if a prohibitory
ordinance should be passed. After a long
struggle the Town Trustees accepted the
offer. The ordinance closing saloons was
passed, going into effect last October.
The temperance people throughout the
State became interested in the fight, and
in the language of Mr. Naylor 'subscrip
tions poured in from every hamlet" to
fwell the fund. ThÂ»-y have paid in to dat*
$r<"o. and the third quarter payment of
$450. due April 10, Is ready.
The twenty or more nalonn-kc^pers in
the. town we're not idle. They organized,
and backed by larger interests war was at
once opened on the ordinance. Most of
the saloon men did not close their places.
The result was that twenty odd were ar
rested and either convicted or pleaded
guilty in Justice Robert Edgar's court at
Berkeley, established under warrant of
special act of the last regular session of
the Legislature. One caÂ«e, that of George
Fedderwitz, was taken for the legal con
test to follow. From his conviction an
appeal was taken to the Superior Court,
the plant. $103,000 for operating expenses
and $â¬3,(Â¥W (<>r taxes. Their receipts for
water rates from San I^andro, Kmery
viiip a portion of Berkley and along the
SamLeandro road will amount to about
$38,009. The company claims to be entitled
to air of these operating expenses, taxes
and additions^ minus the amount received
from tiieso. towns, and 7 per cent upon
tlxir valuation, which they hold will
amount to $763,000. and this sum must
come from the city of Oakland. The

Flaring disposed of figures the complaint
says that the now ordinance is void und
of no eflVct in that it was passed without
giving the Contra Costa Water Company
an opportunity to protest or give any tes
timony. The ordinance, they say. w\is In
troduced March , r >, and was finally passed
March 24. and that the latter date was the
first opportunity at which the company
could be heard and that at that time no
opportunity was given them to introduce
any evidence as to the valuation of iho
plant. Th<r rates were fixed arbitrarily
and "the rateÂ« fixed are grossly unjust,
unreasonable and oppressive." The com
plaint claims that the new rates will not
yield more than $195,000 a year when they
are entitled to $763,000, plus their operating
expensr-s. etc. It is also claimed that th*
Council threatens to forfeit their fran
chise.
The company concludes by asking that
the new rates be declared null and void
and that a mandatory injunction be is
sued requiring the City Council to fix
water rates for the city of Oakland in
accordance with the principles srt forth
above; that all defendants be enjoined
from putting thepÂ«\ rates into force or
from taking any steps toward the for
feiture of its franchise, and that all rights
of the company bo quieted.
Oakland Office Pan Francisco Call.
ill* Broadway. April 5.
t^pHE Contra Costa Water Company
thie afternoon filed the predicted
suit to h:tv* the recently adopted
water rate ordinance declared null
end void, and with thÂ«> filing of this suit
bÂ«c;ns water litigation that will affect the
cr.rire Slat.-. Th.- whole auction of the
rights of municipal bodies to fix water
rntes. ;ho ha vis \;;><>ti which this should be
(Â¦Hi' 1 . thÂ»Â» valuation of water plants, rates
of intf-rt-tat to bÂ«Â» allowed, the right of
ronipanJep to dividends and ih-> inflation
of Â«t'.rk accounts, will all enter into the
trial of ihis suit. Points of law that have
never !â¢â¢â¢ n rais^.i before will come up for
< onsidcratlon; and the case will b^oome
on< of the most important in the State.
Up to the present time there has been
v. ry little litigation o\>r water rates in
tb< State, It has been thÂ«> policy of both 1
corporations and municipalities to avoid
litipation which might be long, trouble-
Kirae and expensive. H;n the action of
the Oakland City Council in making a
h"r:zont;,i reduction of 2.*> per cent in the
v.-ater rates 'his year h.is forced a suit
!h:u will test nearly every phase of Â»hÂ«*
The Miit was filed this afternoon by
William J. Ijinpeo. the largest stock
holder of the Contra <"o?ta Water Com
pany, in person. It ;? brought against the
city of Oakland. City Council of Oakland
iinii each member of the Council by name,
isr.d it is eismed by Page, McCutchen;
Harding & Kr.ight and A. A. Moore as
st:omÂ«*yi. Mr. l>ingee did not make any
?::niin<;r.s to-day, but will have them is
t-v.t-i and s,rv. .1 to-morrow.
ThÂ«Â» complaint i^ particularly interest
ing, as it gives in concise foim exactly
vhnt the Contra Coeta Water Company
ronsiders its plant to be worth, thn in
â¢'onit- from all Kources. and sets forth fx
pcUy what the company claims under the
law Th<- complaint begins by stating
that the company hn? purrhnscd water
rights, property, built reservoirs, pipe
I-: .t- a:i.i pumping ;>!nnts. the value of
which i xc-eds X.500,000. This is fixed as
the valuation upon which it claims >ntÂ»r
*Â«=t at ihÂ«" rate of 7 p^r cent, in addition
to :3xvs, operating expenses and better
nients. This r-urn is the total bond and
etock valuation of the company as it nÂ«w
Ftandf of which 13509.000 la in bonds and
j.-, '.Â»,...Â«â¢, in st/ick. In th^se sums are in
rti:Â«Jed the Ft<vk ard bntids issued for the
urchaTC of the Oaklsui.l Water Company,
which constitute less than half of the on-
The conipiain* then Â«etp forth that the
company will be entitled to S7S.<VV) for the
coming year for necessary additions to
and Judge Hall sustained the validity of
both court and ordinance.
To reach the Supreme Court Fedderwitz
went to Jail and then sued out a writ of
habeas corpus. Now all of the legal points
are about ready for submission. The de
fense has filed its first brief, and that of
the temperance people will be filed in a
day or so. The last brief is due five days
afterward. The saloon-keepers' first mov*
is against the court, as they contend that
if the Herkfley Justice Court shall be de
clared illegal they cannot be convicted
until a Legislature makes ano'her attempt
to establish one. This situation art-tea
from a section of the town charter which
provides that all prosecutions of viola
tions of town ordinances shall be heard
in the Justice Court of the town of
Uerkeley. '; he lawyers claim that such a
!*mit.'Â«tion bars the Oaklrind Township
Justice Court from having Jurisdiction,
although Berkeley i:Â» in the township.
The attack upon the ordinance itself Ia
made upon the flat argument that it is
unconstitutional deprivation of right-".
Without a court under the existing con
ditions the temperance people assert that
the saloonmen could operate their busi
ness at their own swe<-t will, ordinance
or no ordinance, for there would he no
power to punish them for Infractions of
the prohibitory law.
The saloon men have been chafing un
der the restraint of the ordinance which
has thrown them out of business. On the
other hand the State forces of the Anti-
Salnr-n League have united in the fight
at P.erkeley as an initiatory move. They
are now waiting for the Supreme Court's
derision.
The ordinance which is in force at
Berkeley is almost an exact copy of the
Pasadena prohibition law. It exempts
from its provisions all licensed druggist*
and pharmacists. One technical featurÂ«
of the saloon men's brief is a point made
that the complaint aarainst Fedderwltz ta
defective In that it failed to state that
he was not a licensed druggist.
Incidental to these phases of the con
test $375" Imposed a* fines of convicted
saloon men is Involved. The amount rep
resenting the total of fines which Judge
Edgar ordered c">nvletÂ«Â»d saloonmen to
pay. Fedderwitz was fined $C"A For sev
eral years the saloonkeeper had matters
much their own way In Berkeley, because
the Justice Courts were found twice to
have been illegally authorized. To meet
the objections which were "then success
fully raised by the ?alor>nmen their oppo
nents secured the passage of special acts,
"tt'hilf* the Alameda County Superior
Court has several times sustained th*
legality of the Justice Court ' this is the
first time since Its reorganization that the
Supreme Court has been called uonn to
pass upon the lesal status of the college
town's Justice. The prohibitory ordinance
now goes in its present form to the high
est court In the State, although that court
has already declared the Pasadara ordin
ance valid, and this was the model for
Berkeley's law.
Frederick K. Perkins, assistant pay
master, XT. S. N., and son of United States
Senator Perkins, who was with the party
commanded by Lieutenant Gillmore of {he
Yorktown when that officer was captured,
wsÂ»s released from quarantine late last
night and left the transport Sheridan. He
was very ill when he left Manila and
fears for his recovery were entertained,
but the sea voyage proved very beneficial
and to-day Paymaster Perkins reported
for duty at Mare Island.
There was a joyous homp-oominjr at the
residence of Charles O. Huber, 673 Thirty
third street, to-night when his son. Harry
F. Huber, who was a captive of the Fili
pinos for eleven months, was released
from the transport Sheridan and was wel
comed home by mother, father and sis
ters. The young hospital corps private
looked little the worse for the terrible
hardships he had endured. For hours this
evening he told and retold the story of
his capture and experiences.
There was an interesting coincidence In
the return home of Perkins and Huber.
"While the Senator's son had seen the
boat from the Vorktown with Lieutenant
Gillmore disappear, the other Oaklander
was ono of the captured Americans who
fp|l in with the Glllmore party after they
had all been abandoned by the pursued
Filipinos.
"Glad to he lmmc," is all I can say
now," declared young Huber to-night. "I

ANDRISA JUST
TOYED WITH BY
ADVANCE GUARD
Great Chestnut Colt Won the
Match Race Eased to
â Trrr 11
a Walk.
All But One Favorite Suffered De
feat at Oakland â Alas Downed
a Fast Field of Game
Sprinters.
When the match race was consummated
some days ago between the owners of
Advance Guard and Andriaa for $500 a
side, with $700 added by the association,
the most ardent admirers of; Carruthers
& Shields' crack colt did not expect
to obtain better than 7 to 10 against their
money. However, during the interium,
Andrisa had been behaving 30 becoming
ly in her workouts that she readily won
over the sympathy of the rail birds and a
majority of the trainers. Walter Jen
nings felt confident, too. that his filly
would win, and she actually ruled favor
ite In the betting, though it was 9 to 10
and take your pick at post' 'time. An
drisa showed herself to be a fast sprint
er, and that was about all. Henry let
her step off the five furlongs in one min
ute, the seven furlongs in W1&. Just about
this time, Piggott, on the colt, tackled
her, and the race was over. The last fur
long Advance Guard was eased up, and
then won pricking his ear a in 1:52%.
The event proved a star attraction,
drawing a large crowd. to the track over,
the bay. Favorites fared badly, Vesuvian
being the only one to score.
In the opening mile run, Poorlands
showed marked improvement, going out
in the lead and winning all the way. Hen
ry C, piloted by Henry, and a mild favor
ite, ran second, a length ahead of Lizzella.
The winner was as good as 4 to 1.
On Tuesday last Forsina started in a
six furlong sprint, finishing third to Mor
inga and De Blaise. On that occasion her
price in the betting went back from 5 to 9.
When looking a winner at the stretch
turn Mills pulled her out wide, losing half
a dozen lengths. Yesterday, well backed
at 10 to 1, the mare spreadeagled her field
in the second mile run, leading Croker and
Los Prietos out galloping.
Quite an upset was furnished in the five
and a half furlong sprint, for which Ella
Boland closed a slight favorite over Miss
Rowena. After the pair named had killed
themselves off racing out in - the lead.
Mounce, on Alas, an 8 to 1 shot, drew out
of the bunch, disposing of the first choice
by a length in fast time. Miss Rowena
was third.
Atkin & Lottxidge sprung a warm
one in Diderot, which captured the two
year-old dash romping from Parsifal.
Bernota, the 13 to 10 favorite, got cut off
in the stretch, failing to get inside the
money.
The mile run for three-year-olds result
ed in a hollow victory for the 2 to 7 favor
ite. Vesuvian. Lothian secured place hon
ors from Bathos. *
An 8 to 1 chance, Constellator captur
ed the Pinkerton handicap, over one mile
and a furlong. Rosormonde made the
pace leading to within fifty yards of
home, where the three-year-old collared
and beat her out less than a length. Top
most finished third in advance of the fav
orite, Opponent. Â¦â¢
Track Notes.
Jockey Pedro Enos, suspended at Sacra
mento in 1808 by Judge Price, was yester
day reinstated by that official.
The stable of J. F. Fogg left for the
East last niÂ§ht. Carruthers & Shields will
probably ship to-morrow.

Judge and lawyer Clash.
Ernest Graves, the Â¦well-known lawyer
of San Luis Oblspo. is again In troubls
with the courts of that county. Last
Tuesday he gave offense to Judjre E. P.
Unangst. for which he was fined $50. This
caused him, after court .had adjourned, to
say some unpleasant things about the
Judge, who. upon hearing of it, imposed
an additional fine of $200, which Graves
refused to pay. In consequence he was
sent to jail, and yesterday he appealed to
the Supreme Court for a writ of habeas
corpus. It was granted and made return
able on Saturday morning.

THE LATE REV. WILLIAM A. GARDNER.
REV. WILLIAM A. GARDNER, who for years was a prominent figure
of the Christian church of this city, died at Watsonvllle yesterday af
ternoon. He had gone there for a visit. Rev. Mr. Gardner came to
this city in ISS6 in answer to a call to the position of State evangelist
of the Christian church of California, and In that capacity he visited nearly
every part of the State and became well known wherever the Christian church
had been established. He founded three churches in Humboldt County and
then located in "Woodland, where he established another church. In 1893 he
came to this city permanently as pastor of the West Side Christian Church,
and this position he held until in 18t<8, his health failing him, he resigned'
and took a trip to the Hawaiian Islands. He was gone a little more than a
year, and returned last February weaker than when he left. He went at once
to Watsonvllle, where he died.
Mr. Gardner was born in Michigan in 1846. He served In the ranks of the
Federal army during the rebellion, and at 25 years of age he entered the min
istry. He leaves a wife and four children.
Newsboys Out for a Time.
My! what a time those little news
boys did have with a Sunday Call re
porter. First, a swell French dinner,
and then a box at the theater. How
they did eat. and their eyes nearly
popped out of their heads at the count
less strange dishes brought in one af
ter the other and each more wonder
ful than the one that had preceded it.
And how wonderful the play seemed
to them from the charmed precincts
of a box. Only two little ragged news
boys, but they were made supremely
happy and felt like kings for once in
their lives, If never again. Hear them
tell of it 'all in next Sunday's Call.
Very funnyâ and yet pathetic, too.
Fhe was married to Fair in ISfC and she would
like a record of it. with the memoranda, data,
etc.. to be used as evidence in the case. The
next time I saw Sylva and Mrs. Craven wa.Â«
in my rfficÂ«- the following day. The very next
day I s-aw them again. At this time Sylva
handed me a check and said I had better "col
lect It as I was better known in San Fran
cisco. I Intended to cash the check, but Mrs.
â¢ 'raven was thpre and she cashed it herself.
Sylva and I then walked down the street and
I pave him the money.
"The day the contract was made Sylva asked
me to draw It up. but he added the considera
tion clause which called for legal services to
balance the $30,000 section."
"Who mentioned the sum of S30.000?" said
Knight.
"Pylva did," was the response.
"Was any conversation had between Mrs.
Craven and Sylva In regard to what the sum
was to be paid for?"
"No. sir."
"Did you make Inquiry about it?"
"No, sir. Both read the contract and signed
"Have you acted In any capacity as an at
torney for which the sum was to be paid?"
"No, sir: merely a* her friend."
"What then became of the contract?"
"I advised that it be placed In some bank.
They were satisfied that I should keep it,
however. It has never been in the possession
of any one else but John -J". Roche, who Is In
my office."
Did Fylva ever have possemion of it?"
No. sir. but he might have had If he
"What Indorsement Is there on It?"
Dunand then read the pencil Indorsement:
"This belonps to A. Pylva."
Knight asked: "Who wrote It?" But Just
as Pence rose to object he cried out: "That's
all; tiikf the witness." juuinw
Pence Cross-Examines.
The cross examination did not shake the
testimony broupht out in direct examination.
"When was the first conversation with the
lady In rrgard to the Sausalito marriage?"
said Pence.
"When we walked up to Sylva's house from
th" ferry." replied the witm-ss.
"Wa? it not early in August that we called
attention to the fart that there had been a
partial distribution of the real estate nnd that
we had a consultation as to the best steps
to be taken?"
"I know that you simply kindly explained
to me what you thought would be the proper
thing to do, but you never consulted me as
to what you Intended to do."
"Did not the question come up that you
should be one of the attorneys of record and
you replied that It would be better If you
"In part, yes, and It was Sylva who wanted
me to be an attorney of record to protect his
fee. I told you about this after you half
apoloplzed for not ha%'lng done so. I said that
was all right, that I didn't care for It, only
for the solicitation of Sylva."
"You had no financial Interest In the case?"
"No, none whatever, except that If Mrs.
Craven-Fair won the case we were to go
around the world and have a good time."
Continuing Dunand said: "At the time the
contract was drawn up Sylva said he would
see that 1 got something and ehe concurred."
"Did you ever talk of how much of the
$30,000 you were to have?"
"Never talked about any such thing."
Dunand Is Firm.
Dunand, upon his return from Mexico,
said he would not speak of the case to the
reporters before consulting with Mrs.
Craven and her attorneys. He also prom
ised to report to the Pences, but he failed
in this. Then Lafe Pence carried the wit
ness over tho Grand Jury meeting. In
questioning Dunand about different people
whom he saw on the day after his trip
from Mexico the witness ?aid that he had
not been approached by any one on either
side at any time, except McEnerney and
Charles Ileirgerty. All the former wanted
to know was the facts about the $200
check. The witness recollected that he
met Abe Ruef on Montgomery street last
week, but denied that he had mentioned
the contract. EXrT&B
A distinct discrepancy exists between
Mrs. Nettie R. Craven's story in regard to
the signing of the $30,000 contract and that
given by Dunand yesterday. She said
that at first she thought it was $25,000, not
having read it over, but relying upon
Dunand, when he read it to her. The
latter testified yesterday that she read the
contract over and then signed it.
The case will go on next Monday morn

DEATH OF A NOTED
CHRISTIAN MINISTER
STAACKE FILES ANSWER
TO MRS. BELL'S CHARGES
Emphatically Denies That He Has
Mismanaged the Properties
. in His Care.
George Staacke has filed answer to the
petition of Mrs. Theresa Bell, asking that
he be removed as executor of the estate
of tho late Thomas Bell, in which he em
phatically denies that as such executor
he has wasted or mismanaged the prop
erties committed to his charge. After
making this denial. Staacke takes up the
defense of Louisa J. Thompson, and as
serts that she never conspired with him
for the purpose of defrauding Bell's es
tate by transferring through foreclosure
proceedings 20.655 52-100 acres of the
Rancho Laguna at a price $100,000 less
than Its actual value. He explains his
letter to Mrs. Thompson, which was the
basis of Mrs. Bell's belief that such a
conspiracy existed, by stating that he be
lieved it to be his duty, representing as he
did creditors as well as heirs, to notify
Mrs. Thompson that her claim of $50,000
against the rancho could not be paid by
the estate, and that, therefore, if she
wished to assert her rights she would
have to foreclose her mortgage.
Staacke prays that the order heretofore
made suspending his powers as executor
be set aside, and that he be restored to
the management of the estate.

ATTORNEY LOUIS F. DUNAND,
the man who went to Mexico,
mounted the witness-stand in Judge
Troutt* Â¦ courtroom yesterday morn
ing and when the afternoon session of the
Fair case was finished he was still the
target for the battery fire of the petition
er's ?ttorneyp. Slow, heavy and soporific
was the examination of this witness, from
me time the court convened until adjourn
ment. Dunand did not furnish a tithe of
u.e excitement his friend. Adolph Sylva.
produced in the three previous days and
the crowd went away disappointed.
It Is difficult to say just why Dunand
â¢was put upon the stand by the defense.
Ills story was more a defense and excul
pation of hi? own conduct than anything
else. In a measure it was corroborative of
Sylva' s testimony, but only of the weaker,
unimportant evidence that the fluent,
crafty trickster of Sausallto gave from
the stand. Dunand denic-d all complicity in
tne scheme, averrea that he was a friend
of Mrs. Craven and that all his actions
had this motive at their basis. He admit
ted that he was responsible for the intro
duction of Sylva into the case, but in the
fame breath disclaimed that he ever knew
of any nefarious plot to create evidence
of the marriage in Sausalito.
All that he did. according to his own
testimony, was dune out of friendship for
Urs. Craven, whom he wished to see suc
cessful in the litigation. No price was set
upon his service! â nothing but a promise
of a European trip, and he had pictured
to himself an outing that would put guide
books to shame. He believed Mrs.
Craven's story r.bout the marriage to Sen
ator Fair in IÂ£SZ, and in order to secure
the records he introduced her to Sylva.
whom he knew to be "a wise, shrewd and
valuable man" in the discovery of hidden
treasures buried in the Sausalito town
ship.
Sylva and Dunand.
The contract for $30,000, which Dunand
and Mrs. Craven signed, was the subject
or much examination, direct and cross.
The attorney admitted that it was in his
handwriting, but he was equally emphatic
in his declarations that the contract was
made in behalf of Sylva. who feared Ic
ing a principal party because he was not
an attorney. Thf* contract called for ser
vices f uch as qualified attorneys can only
perform. This is the reason assigned by
Ounand for his intimacy with the $30,000
contract.
The first meeting between Dunand. Mrs.
craven and Sylva occurred in July of last
year at Sylva's house, where the introduc
tion took place.

POLICEMEN WILL PAY
FOR HEALEY'S FUNERAL
Alfred Clarke Cannot Recover Funds
to Be Used for This Pur-
Final Judgment on the policy held by
the late Captain Henry S. Healey in the
Widows' and Orphans' Aid Association of
the Police Department of San Francisco
was entered by Judge. Seawell yesterday.
In an opinion the court held that Alfred
Clarke, who, by virtue of an assignment
for money loaned, was declared the bene
ficiary of the policy, which was for $1000,
was not entitled to $100 of this sum. this
amount, under the association by-laws,
being reserved for "necessary funeral ex
penses." After Captain Healey's death
Clarke sued as the beneficiary and was
given judgment. The association paid the
judgment with the exception of $100,
which it reserved for the expenses of de
cedent's funernl. Clarke sued to recover
this amount. Judge Seawell says:
The right of the association to pay. decedent's
funeral expenses cannot be questioned. The
members of the board appear to have been
active In the management of the funeral ano!
It would be a scandal If the undertakers should
have to bear its expense when there is a

RAILROAD MEN
PROTEST DIRECT
TO HUNTINGTON
Respectfully but Firmly Re
quest Withdrawal of
Relief Plan.
Give It as Their Unanimous Opinion
That the System "Would Dz-
Etroy the Brotherhoods.
Railroad to Reply.
, _
â¢ The -lone expected complaint of South
ern Pacific employes against the forcing
upon them by the company of an Insur
ance scheme that will drain their purses
and break up their labor organizations was
laid before President Collis P. Huntlngton
and other prominent officers of the com
pany yesterday. At the appointed hour
nfty-seven delegates, representing six
brotherhoods of railroad men, and prob
ably over 90 per cent of the employes of
the Southern Pacific Railroad Company,
marched in a body to the Hobart building,
where they were shown into a room pre
pared for them. George Estes, chief of
the telegraphers' organization, headed the
party and acted as spokesman.
C. P. Huntington entered the room in
company with Julius Kruttschnitt, J. A.
Fillmore, A. F. Hess and J. B. Dorner.
He smiled graciously upon the commit
teemen and gave them a "glad hand" talk
that was calculated to put them at ease,
said he was glad to meet employes of the
company at all times, and particularly
when they had any grievances to recite.
He hoped that they would express their
ideas on the matter in hand without fear
or reservation and that a satisfactory ad
justment of the difficulty could be ar
ranged.
Cnairman Estes then took the floor and
made a lengthy and minute statement of
the objections of employes to the relief
plan. He said the delegates present rep
resented every department of the service
and a very large percentage of the em
ployes. He and his colleagues had made
a close study of the plan and had reached
the conclusion that It would work a hard
ship on the employes of the company.
This opinion was unanimous.
The principal objection to the plan wag
that it would certainly injure If not en
tirely destroy the brotherhoods, which
were not only benefit orders but a strong
factor in the social life of the railroad
men and their families. The members of
the committee did not believe that it was
the intention of the company to injure
the brotherhoods, but the only logical con
clusion was that the proposed relief plan
would injure and destroy them.
A. P. Hess, who has been placed at the
head of the relief plan, took the floor and
explained to the men in detail the bene
fits of the scheme proposed by the com
pany. Finally Estes announced that it
was the unanimous opinion of the broth
erhoods that the relief plan was injurious
to their interests and that they respect
fully but firmly requested that it be with
drawn completely.
President Huntlngton was an attentive
listener to the whole proceedings, but
neither questioned the speakers nor inter
rupted them. He brought the interview
to an end by saying that he would require
a little time to consider the complaint that
had just been made. He requested the
committee to return to-day at 2:30 p. m.,
when he would probably have his answer
ready for them.
The meeting was executive of course.
After it was over General Manager Julius
Kruttschnitt gave out to the press the
bare details. The men are very much in
earnest. If Huntlngton denies their re
quest at to-day's meeting it is likely that
a formal demand will be made upon him
to withdraw his plan. If he still refuses
there will be serious trouble. There Is no
doubt in the minds of the men that the
relief plan was inaugurated with the idea
of destroying all organization among
them, and when the organization is gone
they become mere slaves of the company.
LOUIS F. DUNAND ON THE WITNESS STAND.
The sole witness of thp day in the Fair case, Louis F.
Dunand, testified that hf.Â« recompense for assisting Mrs. Xettie
R. Craven was to be nothing more than a trip to Europe. If
successful in her present litigation the attorney, and perhaps
his family, would >?ln the lady petitioner in a jolly ramble from
London to Cairo. Dunand declared under oath that he did
not expect a 5 cent piece out of the $30,000 stipulated in the con
tract, which was drawn up between Mrs. Xc-ttie R. Craven and
himself. He said that he was acting in Sylva's behalf and it
was the latter who was to reap the rewards. From his man
ner Dunand hardly anticipates the European tour.
