To drop three shells in succession within a space less than one hundred feet square, at ordinary

"Long Tom" on Isiznbulwani Mountain did when a battery of British artillery was returning 1 to" Lady

TON HOTEL, .WASHINGTON, April 30.â
Naval coercion of Turkey to obtain a set
tlement of American missionary claims Is
not contemplated by the administration.
This statement Is made upon high author
ity., Drastic measures against the Turk
have been urged by former Minister An
gell, by politicians on behalf of mission
aries and by ministers of the gospel, but
the President and Secretary Hay have not
considered their suggestions. The admin
istration is well satisfied with the conces
sions made by the Sublime Porte, and
while it is anxious that the Sultan shall
keep his promise to pay the.claims It feels
that he already has been considerate oi
this Government In permitting the recon
struction of the American mission in Har
poot and in the extension of the Roberta
College in Constantinople.
. It is authoritatively stated that the lat
est note presented to the Porte by Mr.
Griscom. the American Charge d' Affaires,
Is not an ultimatum, but Is merely a repe
tition of the demand for a settlement.
There is no disposition in the State De
partment to unduly hasten the Porte'b
answer. While an evasive reply Is ex
pected. . an official Â¦ said to-day that the
Government would calmly await the out
come, believing that it would be satisfac
tory to Turkey as well as the United
States."' This official said the President
contemplated only as a remote possibility
a severance of diplomatic relations, and
this possibility haU almost entirely disap
peared as a result of the concessions the
Sultan has already made.
It is likely from all that can be learned
that the extent of the expression of dis
pleasure by this Government at the con
tinued failure of the Porte to pay the
claims will be the maintenance of a
charge d'affaires in Constantinople." Min
ister Straus Is not expected to return, and
until the claims are settled it is not pro
posed that any Minister shall be sent to
Turkey. The conclusion of the adminis
tration not to adopt the suggestions that
this Government make a naval demonstra
tion in Turkish waters is undoubtedly due
to knowledge that Europe would resent
the entrance of the United States into the
Turkish question.
There is -some reason to believe that a
powerful effort is being put forth by the
Turkish Government to compromise the
missionary claims â¢ Â¦ unofficially. The
method which is looked upon as most
feasible is that connected with the build
ing of a warship for Turkey In the United
States. If the claimants chose to receive
the amount of their claims from an Amer
ican ship builder Instead of through the
State Department, thereby removing from
the department the basis for further pros
ecution of Its demand upon the Porte,
some interesting point3 of International
law might be raised. It would seem that
once committed to the State Department,
an International claim cannot be with
drawn without the consent of the depart
ment, though whether there would be a
refusal inthis case cannot be stated.
LONDON, May 1.â The Constantinople
correspondent of the Standard say3: "It
is tolerably certain mat .a settlement
with the United States Is not far distant,
since not only is Turkey averse to seeing
a precedent established for making na
val demonstrations, but several other
powers are. disquieted over the active In
terference of the United States, which in
troduces a new element â¢ Into the Eastern
question and offers an example which
might easily be followed by Great Brit
ain."

owner, who asserts that his associates
are attempting to freeze him out. This
charge is substantiated in the affidavit of
a miner named G. M. - Boyd. who avers
that one and a half kegs of powder were
placed in shafts and that by their explo
sion great quantities of earth were dis
turbed. Robinson claims that the mine is,
worth $3,000,000. and that the men em
ployed do work as they please and; that
no responsible head is found to properly

ADMIRAL DEWEY
CHICAGO. April 2O.-Amidthe booming
f cannon and the cheers of hundreds of
people Admiral George Dewey arrived in
Chicago to-day. For the next three days
he will be the guest of this city, and the
programme for his entertainment will
tske up nearly every moment until his de
rart'jrc on Thursday mcrninjj for Jack
sonville. III.
The special train bearing the admiral
and Mrs. IX-wey, Lieutenant Caldwell, his
secretary, and Lieutenant Crawford was
met near South Chicago by another Fpe
cial carrying the general executive com
mittee of the Dewey celebration and inÂ»
oludir.g Mayor Harrison, lion. Charles M.
Plamor.rtcm and the admiral's son, George
Goodwin Dewey.
â¢The admirals train arrived at the
Grand Central depot, at Fifth avenue and
Harrison street, six minutes ahead ot
schedule time. 21 o'clock. A strong pla
toon of police had been stationed at the
platform gates, and the immense crowd
which had congregated in the streets sur
rounding the station and packed almost
to suffocation the bis depot building It
ec!f was not allowed to go inside the train
ttied.
The moment the whltc-mustached naval
hero was seen a rear of cheers went up
from, the fortunate ones inside the sta
tiÂ£i and tvus quickly taken up by the
thousands in the stret-ts. Kscortcd by the
members of the general executive com
mittee. Admiral Dewey and Lieutenants
Caldweil and Crawford proceeded down
the lung platfcrm and mounted the steps
leading to the driveway, where carriages
were in waiting.
Mrs. Dewey, who was somewhat fa
tigued by the long journey from Wash
ington, did not accompany Admiral
Ifcewey on his ride through r 'jhe downtown
street*, but, escorted by the special com-,
mittee of the woman's reception commit
teeâMrs. Byron Lathrop. Mrs. Carter h.
Harrison fcnd Mrs. Charles A. Plamondon ;
âwent direct to the Annex, where she
retted until the arrival of Admiral
Dewey. .
Guns Roar a Welcome.
The route to the Annex was on Fifth
avenue to Jackson boulevard, thence down
Michigan avenue. Along those streets
were gathered crowds that literally pack
ed the pidewalks. The cheering that start
Â«d at- the depot swept along. the streets
bs the admiral and his party were slowly
driven to their apartments, the applause
being almost without -cessation until the
admiral entered the hotel. As the party
reached the corner of Jackson boulevard
und Dearltorn street a signalman on the
top of tbe Great . Northern Hotel wig
v.agped that fact to a land -battery stand
in the Chicago. Rock Island and Pacific j
Hallway yarrts and to the officers of the
revenue cutter. Morrill and the United
States ship Michigan in the harbor. In
etantly the land battery roared out the
admiral's salute of seventeen guns, while
the gunr, of the -ships were fired in the
twenty-one guns of the tfiaval salute. '_â¢ .-
At i:3u p. m. an informal luncheon was
given Admiral and Mrs. Dewey by the
v.-oman'g reception committee.- J^ater. a
delegation cf Canadians called -on thead-'
miral and "presented him with a formal
invitation to be present at a reception to

Stanley. Ontario, on any day In July conv

In reply thanked the Canadians very cor
dially for the Invitation.
"Of all the evidences of good willshown
me since my arrival in'New York last Oc
tober," said he. "non^ has touched me
more deeply than this. We are of the same
blocd. There is but slight difference be
tween us and I want to say that the cm*

courage he inspired me with I don't know

Scene at the NavalBall.
ICtver in tho history of the great Audi
torium has there been within Its walls a
Fight more beautiful than that revealed
to-night when tho great ball given in
honor of Admiral Dewey was at Its height.
It v/as a decisive success from first to
last in all details, from the decorations on
the walls to the reception proper. There
w^re present perhaps somewhat too many
people to allow of all dancing in comfort,
but when the dance programme proper
was fairly under way the older, people
Fought the boxes and the spacious foyer,
leaving the floor to the younger people,
who used it until daybreak. Fully 2000
persons were present.
It being a naval ball the predominating
decorations were of white and green. A
canopy. was drawn over the hall, making
it resemble a huge white-capped wave,
the deep green at the bottom shading
softly into the purest white at the top
most edge. At intervals around the tiers
of boxes were placed white galleons.'
which seemingly started from the mist of
bunting and dellcate-hued electric lights
which concealed them a few feet from the
prow, where dolphins arose from tho im
aginary sea below. Above each galleon
arose a towering mast bearing. in. relief a
lion's head and fluttering with the signal
flags of the navy. Behind the figurehead
of each galleon stood a sailor â a veteran
of the Spanish-American warâ who saw
active service in the Caribbpan Sea. Un
til after the admiral left the hall these
men stood steadily peering out over the
prow "of the fanciful and beautiful ships.
Long festoons of electric lights, marked
alternately by yellow lantorns and Japan
ese lanterns of many shades, hung from
top to top of the great white masts ex
tending around the. hall. On the right
and the left of what is usually the stage
of the great theater were erected plat
forms of honor, upon the first of which
the admiral and Mrs. Dewey were seated,
within hand-shaking distance of those
upon the dancing floor. ITpon the second
platform were seated Mayor and Mrs.
Harrison. Â»."â :-. .â.'â¢ :.i.
Admiral Shakes Many Hands.
At 9 o'clock the patronesses and man
agers of the ball, who formed the recep
tion committee, entered the ballroom. At
the right of the line as it formed to re
ceive the guests stood Mayor Harrison,
then followed a long line of managers and
patronesses. When 'Admiral and Mrs.
Dewey entered' they were followed by a
throng of less distinguished guests.- Im
mediately behind the admiral came, with
their wives, the naval officers on duty in
Chicago and the offlcers of the United
States steamer Michigan. Behind the
navy came the army, headed by Major
General James F. Wade and Mrs. Wade,
officers of General Wade's staff, with their
wives, and officers of the garrison at Fort
Sheridan and their wives. Officers of the
revenues service, followed arid behind them
came officers .of- the Illinois National
Guard, closing the j)rocesslon of the city's
guests.- â¢â¢â¢â¢. Â¦:--.' .' â¢ -'- ." ':
â¢ -The admiral and Mrs. Dewey. after they
had exchange*! greetings with the mem
bers of the. reception committee, took
their stand at Mayor Harrison's right and.
to them were presented the guests of the
city who had followed them into the hall.
Then came in long lines the guests of
the balL all who desired being afforded
an .opportunity of greeting the admiral i
ajid his wife. There, was no grand march,
the admiral's party retiring to his box
when the line of guests had passod and
the orchestra striking up De Koven's two
step. "The Dragoons," the floor was sur
rendered to the dancers. . .
At midnight the admiral and Mrs.
Dewey left the hall for a luncheon in their
honor given in an adjoining room by Ho
bart C. Chatfield-Taylor. and then, after
returning to the ballroom for a brief in
terval he and his party retired.

THE BACHELORS' CLUB
FRANKFORT, Ky.. April 20.â Five of
the defendants charged with complicity
or as accessories^ in the murder of "Wil
liam Goebel were arraigned this afternoon
before Judge Cantrill. They were: Repub
lican Secretary of State Caleb Powers,
Captain John W.. Davis. Harland "Whitta
ker. .W. H. Culton and Richard Combs
(colored). All of them entered pleas of
not guilty. Henry E. Youtsey, who previ
ously,had been arraigned and pleaded not
guilty, joined with the other prisoners in
asking for a change of venue.
After the arraignment ex-Governor John
Young Brown, for the defense, tendered
pardons granted by Republican Governor
Taylor to Caleb Powers and John Davis
and offered them as a bar to the prosecu
tion. In presenting the pardons ex-Gover
nor Brown said that he did so as a mat
ter of form and not with the hope that
the court would sustain the motion for
dismissal. Judge Cantrill, in overruling
the motion, said:
"The alleged pardons are not Rood In
law. The title to the office of Governor Is
in dispute and the litigation over it is
still pending in a court. Several of the
courts have passed on the questions at
issue and- those that have so passed there
on Jecided that' Mr. Taylor is not Gover
nor and was not at the time these pre
tended pardons were granted."
The petitions for changes of venue were
then made. The prosecution entered an
objection and filed counter affidavits The
defense maintained that it was Impossi
ble in the present state of public feeling
for. the. defendants to obtain a fair and
impartial trial in this community. The
counter affidavits stated that there was no
such feeling as would prevent a fair and
impartial trial. Both sides presented a
lengthy list of witnesses, who were called
to give testimony as to the state of feeling
and the question as to whether a fair trial
could be ordered here.
Three witnesses were heard on the side
of the prosecution In regard to the change
of venue. The hearing of evidence on this
question will probably take up most of the
day to-morrow.
SUSPECTS APPEAL FOR
A CHANGE OF VENUE
was begun in the United States Supreme
Court at 12:30 to-day. The first presenta
tion was made on behalf of Governor Tay
lor by Attorney Helm Bruce. Bruce was
accompanied by a"number of "distinguished
Kentuckians and the lobby was, crowded.
The members of the court were present
and from the beginning gave close atten
tion to Bruce' s plea. '
Bruce said that Taylor's contention was
for constitutional liberty and that it was
waged in a court of justice and'not on a
field of carnage, because in entering the
Union Kentucky had 'surrendered its right
of resistance. Ho. came to this court, on
the basis of tho principle laid down in an
opinion of the former court that the arbi
trary exercise of power of government un
restrained for private rights and justice
could not be tolerated. Bruce reviewed
the case at length upon its merits, con
tending that after the issuance of the
certificate of election Taylor was as much
the Governor of Kentucky as any man
tvho. had ever been "inaugurated for that
office. He denied that the legislative ad
judication was any adjudication at all,
contending that to oust Taylor by this
process would be to deprive him of his
office by despotic power and not by due
process of law.
Democrats Took Secret Action.
Referring to the contest before the Ken
tucky legislature, he said that the report
of the committee of investigation present
ed no evidence and stated no fact and that
it was made to a secret meeting of the
Assembly, of which no Republican mem
ber had been notified. In this connection
he referred at length to the charge that
the ballots -used were thinner than re
quired by law. If this was true, he said,
the wrong was that of 'the State if wrong
had been committed ; ; surely one-third of
the voters of the State could not be de
prived of the right of, franchise on such a
plea/ Bruce was followed' by. Hon.' Law
rence Maxwell in Governor Beekham's,in
terest. He said that the constitution of
Kentucky made the Legislature the adju
dicator in contests for State offices in that
State. The proceeding in this case had
been in accordance with - the law under
the constitution. There had been no au
thority, ns was claimed on. the other side,
for dissolving the Legislature by Gover
nor Taylor.' Maxwell contended . that the
case ; presented no . Federal question and
that, therefore, the' Federal Supreme
Court had no jurisdiction. The Kentucky
State. Court of Appeals had decided that
Taylor had never acquired title to the of
fice of . Governor under the constitution
and laws of the State.. The decision was
final, and a" national court had no part
to play in the proceedings. As to the cer
tificate of election from the State Board
of Canvassers, it was merely a writing
showing the returns of the election offi
cers. It was no evidence of validity -. : of
title in view of the conclusion reached by
the constitutional authority, which was
the State Legislature.,- .
a State Question..'
In view of the.' fact that; the case was
merely a State question. Maxwell: thought
it unnecessary to consider, the application
of-, the- fourteenth amendment -of- the. con
stitution concerning .the; taking; of
erty without Â¦ due â¢ process Â¦ of â¢ law. As â¢'-. a
matter of fact-.that l amendment. could be
brought^ into requisition only on a case
where a right had accrued and that;, was
not true in this instance: The decision of
the ' Kentucky court shows that>Taylor

ceived from Its Washington correspondent
the first statement from Senator Hanna.
-who is chairman cf the Republican com
mittee, concerning the outlook of the
coming Republican campaign from a Re
publican standpoint.
"As a result of a careful study of the
situation I feel perfectly safe In making
the prediction at this time that McKinley
will be re-elected. There is no way of
figuring how the Republicans can lose in
the coming contest if they put their
shoulders to the wheel and are not Imbued
with a spirit of overconfldence. The price
of the victory will be much narder and re
quire constant effort irora the time the
campaign opens unttl election day.
"The Republicans should make the same
kind of a fight they did, In 1S96. There
should be no cessation In their endeavor
to elect their candidates, and their appli
cation and attention to the details of the
campaign must be steady and unceasing.
They should go into the contest on the
supposition that hard work Is absolutely
essential to the victory.
"The spirit of the Republicans this year
is of a most gratifying kind. At the Ohio
State Convention, held In Columbus last
week, this spirit was manifested In a plain
and unmistakable manner. The delegates
even then were preparing for the great
political battle which Is soon to begin, and
it was patent that thoy will go Into It with
great energy. Senator Fairbanks, who
has Just returned from the Indiana con
vention, informs me that the Republicans
of his State possess the same Inspiration.
"This Is true of Republicans in every
State and all reports which I have re
ceived along this line are to the same
effect. Evidence Is plentiful that the Re
publican , party all over the country
realizes fully, the necessity of entering the
campaign with earnestness and a deter-
mlnation to win a victory. In going over
the list of- States that cast their electoral
votes for McKinley four years ago I do
not see any which will not do the same
this year unless It be Kentucky. That
State I am placing in the doubtful col
umn, although we certainly purpose mak
ing every effort to carry It. I regard
Maryland, which the Democrats are
claiming already, as reasonably certain to
remain In the Republican column. Be
sides holding' our own In practically all
the States that we carried In 1S9Â»>. we
have reason to believe that the Repub
licans will carry Kansas, South Dakota
and Washington, which went for Bryan
four years ago. while our chances are ex
cellent. I am Informed by Senators Shoup
and Carter of winning Idaho and Mon
tana, the States they represent in the
Senate. Altogether I am pleased with the
outlook, which couid not be any more en
couraging than it Is."

FLOCKING TO THE
ISLAND OF TUTUILA
Special DlF^atch to Thp Call.
SAX JOSE. April 30.â A rancher's du
plicity, which involved the loss of thirty
acres of land, was related by Silas Shir
ley on the iritness-Etand in Judge Rhodes'
court to-day during- the proceedings in
the foreclosure suit of M. L Hill against
T. H. White. The action is one in which
Hill sues White to recover $1000 due
on a promissory note, secured by"
mortg-atreâ on â¢ thirty acres of land
near Mllpltap. Shirley is a de
fendant intervenor in this suit, and
also has a suit pending. In which he is
seeking to have the land set apart to him
on the ground that he was unlawfully de
prived of it.
Shirley, who is as verdant as the 3elds
he formerly tilled, stated on the witness
stand that at one time he owned the
thirty acres of land near Milpltas. He
Journeyed to San Francisco one day, and
on the train he met White, to whom he
confided his financial troubles, among
them that he was In debt several thou
sand dollars. Shirley said White sym
pathized with him. and told him he had
a mine in Oregon worth about $40,000,000;
that be was pcing to pet apart some of
the money for philanthropic purposes,
end that Shirley s case was one that
would appeal to him. He said he would
let Shirley have enough money to pay his
debts. Shirley finally went to San Fran
cisco to see White to get what he sup
posed would be a gift of several thou-
Fand dollars. At White's office he met
Hill. At the request of White, who said he
would pay on! all the debts (some $5000),
Shirley gave him (White) what he sup
pofed was a trust deed to his ranch, but
which later proved to be an absolute
deed. White, however, persisted in -pre
senting Shirley with forty shares of min
ing stock, which he said would make a
capitalist of him, and then he could re
pay the kindness done. Shirley received
no money from White for a ranch worth
over JJO.OOO. and when he appealed to him
several times for money White told h!m
the mine had proved a failure. He then
realized he had been taken in.
Hill declared on the stand he knew
nothing of the transactions between
White and Shirley, and the deed to the
property had been assigned to him by
White in lieu of a $CT0 indebtedness.
Judge Rhodes decided the foreclosure
Bult In favor of Hill, saying that side
matter? of Shirley and White could not

William Hayden of Los Angeles
Says He Knew Very Little
0 ., of the Girl.
Special Dispatch .to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, April 30.â When the
information reached Los Angeles to-day
that Minnie M. Wray had committed sui
cide in the Palmer House, Chicago, her
friends were at a loss to find a motive
for the deed. The young woman came to
Los Anseles three weeks ago with a
party of friends that had been touring
Arizona, New Mexico and Texas points.
The party took lodgings and visited the
many seaside and summer resorts In this
section. By tho3e who seemed to know
her best Miss Wray was considered
bright, witty and above the average in
points of intellect.
Among, the girl's effects was found a
note, in v whlch she stated that she had
wrecked too many live* already, and in
tended to end It all. A business card, of
the firm of Mullen & Bluett was also
found, and on the back was the name of
William Hayden. He has charge of^the
hat department in Mullen & Bluett's es
tablishment, and says his real name is
WHmot II. Hider. Regarding the de
ceased, he said that he knew her but
slightly. .
"About three weeks ago four young
women came into the store to look at the
sombreros thatÂ»areso fashionable in this
section," he said. "One of them, whom
1 take to be Miss Wray, told me they
were Chicago milliners, enjoying a vaca
tion in Southern California, and that they'
would return East in a few days. Two
of them purchased hats. When they left
I gave them my business card, which is
not an unusual thing for clerks to do.
That , possibly accounts for ' the card be
ing found among the dead girl's effects."

Only two poolrooms will be allowed to

Track Notes.
The poor showing of Clarando caused
the judges to inquire Into her run. Dr.
Fitzgerald examined the mare, reporting
that she had grabbed "herself during the
progress ,of the race, taking a chunk out
of one ankle. It was also said she had
run away three miles on Sunday, which
was denied. Caesar. Young later sold
Clarando for $100.

NEW YORK, April 30.â At the Hercules
Athletic Club to-night Bob Fitzsimmons
proved that he was far from being a
"dead one." In : less than two rounds he
knocked out Ed Dunkhorst, the Syracuse
giant, a feat which other and bigger men
found impossible. Fitzstormons showed
that his- wonderful hitttng" powers have
not forsaken him and he was as lively on
his feet as ever, but had little time in
which to display, the fact. Â¦
The bout was booked to go twenty-five
rounds. Fitzsimmons was cheered lustily
when ho entered the rinff. The attendance
exceeded 4000. Dunkhoist was attended
by Tommy Ryan, Jack. Jeffries and Jan
Johnson. The lanky fellow was "looked
after by Ernest Roeber, Jeff Thome and
Dan Hickey. Dunkhorst appeared to
weigh 260 pounds and /was very fat. Bob
looked lit and. weighed about 170 pounds.
When they shook hands it was seen that
Dunkhorst was the tiller by at least two
Inches. ,
'As the bell rang Dunkhorst assumed a
crouching position. Fitzsimmona walked
around him for a bilef second and then
hooked a left that raised a lump under
Ed's right eye. He Jsinded another of the
same kind a second later and then drove
his left hard to thfi wind and "ducked a
right swing for tJie head. Dunkhorst
landed a light left to the face and Fitz
slmmons closed the round with left and
right to the body.
Dunkhorst open* A the second round
with a left to the face and Bob hooked
his left to the Jaw and ducked Ed's re
turn. Fitzsimmons received another jab
on the mouth, but only smiled and ripped
right and left to tie stomach. Two more
lefts to the stomach, followed by a right,
made the giant wobble. Fitzsimmons
measured him coolly and then hooked his
left flush to thÂ«e mark and Dunkhorst went
to the floor with a crash. It was fully a
minute before hla -seconds could raise him
to his feet, and meanwhile Fitzslmmona
was cheered wildly by the crowd. Time of
round, 2 minutes iS seconds. _

MERRIAM NOT
ANTAGONISTIC
TO UNIONISM
General Explains His Stand
in the Coeur d'Alene
Troubles.
Declares He Sought Only to Suppress
an Element That Was Respon
sible for Criminal
WASHINGTON. April 30.â Brigadier
General Merriam was again on the stand
In the Coenr d'Alene Investigation to-day,
with Attorney Robertson conducting the
"Would you consider It right," aslied
Robertson, "that Federal troops should
force men at the point of the bayonet to
protect the property of the mine owners,
and that similar protection be withheld
irom the men?"
"1 would use Just as much power and
Just as much Influence," replied General
Merriam, "to have mine owners observe
their obligations as to compel the mine
men to observe theirs."
Concerning the permit proclamation.
General Merriam said he had suggested
to Bartlett Sinclair, the civil official In
charge, that certain features should be
embodied, and they were put In by Sin
clair.
When Robertson sought to show that
the War Department had not been suffi
ciently advised as lo the permit system
General Merriam said that was for the
War Department to determine. Witness
was asked if the dispatches of Secrttar>
Alger did not In effect say, "Let the per
mit system alone."
GeneraJ Merriam said he had not inter
fered in this nyptem or in the labor affairs
In any way, "except for the purpose of
maintaining order."
Corrects a Former Interview.
General Merriam was questioned as to
an interview representing that at a meet
ing: of the citizens in the Coeur d'Alene
he eald that Congress should pass a law
to deal with unions as criminal organ
izations. He said he was glad of the op
portunity to correct the errors of this
alleged Interview. He had not. he said,
mentioned Congress, nor did the inter
view so state, although an erroneous in
terpretation of this character had arisen.
He Katd that what he had said at that
meeting was In substance as follows:
"You ought to have a conspiracy law
which would make the action of these
people â narrated by Mr. Sovereign in his
paperâ crimes punishable by law."
He also said that the remedy for the
trouble was in the State. He was per
fectly positive, he said, that he had not
stultified himself by telling these genile
raeti that the remedy was in the State
and at the came time that it was with
Congress.
"Did not Mr. Gompers at Denver charge
you with making the statement?" asked
Robertson.
**I never saw Mr. Gompers In my life,"
answered General Merriam.
Robertson said that in an address at Den
ver Gompers had made a charge of this
character. General Merriam said he had
repeatedly stnted that he never pronounc
ed the unions of the Coeur d'Alene.crimi
nal organizations.
Not Opposed .0 Unionism.
To Representative Dick General Mer
riam Ftated that he did not disapprove of
labor organizations as euch. for. like other
social and charitable organizations, they
accomplished much pood in their legiti
mate spheres. But he expressed the opin
ion that radical leadership in the Coeur
d'Alene had diverted these organizations
from th<4r beneficial spheres.
Representative Sulzer cross-examined
General Merriam particularly on the ex
tent of his authority in the Ooeur d'Alene
n-pion. The witness paid the State offi
cers assumed responsibility for the gen
eral policy in force, and he was satisfied
to let the responsibility rest there. Gov
ernor Steunonbcrs; had frankly and gen
erously taken upon himself full re*=pon."Â«l
hility, although. General Merriam said, he
had not asked the Governor to assume
responsibility for anything the military
commander of the troops had done.
General Merriam completed his testi
mony during the afternoon and was ex
cused. Sulzer at this point sought to In
troduce two telegrams just received. on.e
fa'.leging that Patrick J. Murphy was ar
rested in the Couer d'Alene region last
nlcht for having expressed criticism on
the course of investigation, the other
from Edward Boyce. president of th*
Western Federation nt Miners, denying
the Etatemt-nts of Governor Steunenberg
as to Bovce's connection with the blow
ing up of the Bunker Hill mill. Sulzer
asked that Boyce and Murphy be Fub
penacd. There was energetic opposition
against taking this up. except In the us
ual way of executive sessions, and It went
over.
Captain Frank A. Edwards began his
testimony during the day. He was in
command of the troops guarding the pris
oners and his evidence was as to the care
shown the men. , He also made a general
denial of the charges of harshness made
against the troops.
SCAFFOLDING COLLAPSES.

SCOTT ACCEPTS PARTIAL !:
PAYMENT OF TAXES DUE
Corporations Tender Second Install
ment en Real Estate and Personal
Property Other Than Bonds.
Tax Collector Scott yesterday accepted
a number of partial payments of taxes
due by banks and corporations; where the
rematalsg portion is in dispute, though
xY.n City Attorney has advised the City
.treasurer that a taxpayer has no right
to tender only a portion ot his taxes and
oo:npci a. receipt therefor. The opinion
yrows out of the refusal of certain banks
and other corporation? to pay taxes on
bor'Js and offering the Tax Collector only
their taxes due on real estate and such
ether personal property as they have
heretofore lÂ»eÂ«n in the habit of paying.
A number of these corporations tendered
a. portion of their second installments of
taxes which fell due yesterday. Scott ac
cepted the money as his predecessor had
do:ie on the lirst installment, but he Issued
a receipt It: which It was agreed that the
acceptance of the amount shall not be
held as a waiver of the city's right to col
lect anv additional sum or to enforce any
ricrbts In the collection of such taxes or
penalties.
T'nder Lane's opinion the Treasurer may
refuse to accept the portion so collected.

IN THE PLOT TO
OPEN INGLESIDE
An opinion was handed down by the
Supreme Court yesterday to the effect
that Boards of Education cannot be com
pelled to issue teachers' certificates to ap
plicants who decline to take the exam
inations prescribed.
Alys L. Kemble brought action In man
date^in the Superior- Court of Tulare to
compel the Board of education of that
county to issue to her a teacher's certifi
cate of the high school grade.- She made
her. application upon the fact that she
held a California State University di
ploma, and her contention was based upon
section 1775 of the Political Code of Cali
fornia, which says that "the board may
also without examination grant county
certificates of either the grammar or the
primary grade." etc. The lady refused to
take an examination, and contended that
the word "may" should be construed as
"must." She won her point In the lower
court, but the Supreme Court takes the
other view of the case. It holds that toe
standard of proficiency may be dlff erenx.
in different counties. As a result the
county with the lowest standard would
get all the examinations and the candi
dates .after obtaining their certificates
could go elsewhere to teach.
: As to the language of the code, the Su
preme Court holds that it is not manda
tory, but. plainly permissive and discre
tionary.-.

Under the terms of the resolution, which

Comte's order repealing the ordinance

quarter and providing for the total sup
pression of the gambling devices was in
definitely postponed at yesterday's meet-
Ing of the Board of Supervisors and a
compromise measure raising the license to
$10 per quarter was recommended to the
Judiciary Committee for favorable action.
An oraer recommended for passage by
the Police Committee fixing the license
at $25 per ouarter was opposed by Comte.
It was explained that the license was in
tended to be a practical suppression of
the machines. Comte granted that little
revenue would be derived if the high li
cense was imposed, but said that it would
Jiot prohibit tne operation of the machines
altogether. r ..-;Â¦:
Former Superior Judge Levy addressed
the board on behalf of lower license. He
argued that the city should obtain as
much revenue as it could by a fair tax.
If it were placed at 525 the poor man who
was trying to earn a living would be;de
prived cf the privilege enjoyed by the rich
man, who could afford to- pay it./ : .He
thought that the number, of machines in
use would drop from lUCOto \i'jO .if ..the $25.

manipulator known to the profession of the lobby

BY the action of the Board of Supervisors yester
day in passing to print an ordinance' prohibit
ing pool-selling or bookmaking upon horse
racing or dog coursing the people are brought within
sight of a complete victory over the track gamblers,
it has been a hard contest and a prolonged one, and
upon the result yesterday the public is to be congratu
lated and the Supervisors commended.
The success thus achieved in the interests: of
morality and public welfare is the more notable be
cause of the persistent efforts made .by the : track
gamblers to obtain a license to carry on their ruinous
trade. They retained the service of a strong lobby
and spared no money in the light. Every kind of
VICTORY IN SIGHT.
â¢The' disorderly man of Chicago claimed that he is
as useful to a political procession as any player in the
band, and perhaps he is right in the claim. He has
at any rate some merits. He works hard at his blow
ing, but his horn has a cork in it and, disturbs ho one.
Thus he is a blower whose blowing has the charm of
silence. We may mock him on general principles, but
there are times when we must wish that all the band
were like him. Certainly a man who is a filler in the
noisy during his hours of labor has some excuse for.
making Rome howl when he has his recreation, and
it is gratifying to know, that the Chicago Judge was
compassionate to the particular filler before him and
let him go with a warning.
â¢ In the Bryanite band wagon, for â¢ example, how;
many dummies are there? There: is a brave show
made at every town where Bryan goes' and a plen
tiful array of men are set up alongside of him as es
corts and supporters.. To the casual observer the
wagon appears* to be filled with influential men, first
fiddlers and blowers of big horns. The acute listener,
however, will soon note that no sound is heard "ex
cept that which emanates from the hollow caverns of
Bryan's own skull. The parade is stuffed. Â¦ The silver
man's show is made up of dummies.
i Here .we, have a -statement; that casts- a . beam of
illumination' upon an obscure corner of politics. How
many a man dp we se? occupying a position which we
know he is.-.incompetent to fill? He has a horn, as
it were, 5 and yet he ;could not play a tune on it to
save him from limbo.- "That kind of man is visible in
every department of political life. A good many of
them are in Congress, even in; the Senate itself. In
all great public movements they are plentiful. They
are conspicuous at mass-meetings. They show up at
gatherings of prominent citizens. In-short,^when
ever-a procession moves there' are dummies in the
band wagon, fillers in the noisy; men who to be
playing a great part,-. but who play nothing: â¢ " -I â¢Â¦

:'. Even with that iexplanati6n r the Judge: iyas T hot satisr;'
fied/and the.novv. thoroughly subdued citizen went oh;
to say:- -''There: is !grea.t demand ior bands nowadays..
to' stir up',;ehthusiasrn for political meetings. : Usually.^

If Colonel Bryan wish to be understood as say
ing that if President he .would embroil the country in
another costly foreign war, all right. .What he says
is in violation of the Monroe doctrine, for that means
that we will keep our official hands ou.1 of European
affairs in which the interests of our- nation and its
citizens are not involved. . ',
His utterance is that of a demagogue, and the prom
ise it discloses is one that can be kept only; at the cost
of war. The American people sympathize with the
Boers and have given substantial evidence of that fact.
They did not wait for Colonel Bryan, to tell theni
vhere their sympathies should run.;. '
The President of the United States is^ invested with
power over international affairs. 'He : cannot offi
cially express sympathy with cither belligerent in a
foreign war. Congress may do so; the people may
do so. For the President to do so is a different mat
ter. It means in his case not a? friendly, but an un
friendly expression, and would be rightly considered
at home and abroad as an act intended to lead to war.
That request has been made of this "Government by:
the Boers, and was acceded to and the tender of good
otfices was made to England. and declined by. that
power. That is all "that the President :ipf the United
States can do, short of an act of War against Great
Britain. Colonel Bryan in McKiriley's place could
do no more and no less. His tender would be of
no more influence than the tender' already made. :
When he pretends that he as President' could do any
more than has been done he is pretending only, in
the hope of fooling somebody out of. a few votes! :
Perhaps Colonel Bryan does not himself know; just.,
what he means. He regards it as a vpip-calcliiit'g;
thing to say, and therefore puts 'it among' Jiiiptiie^
campaign properties and mktextaX '. ; '!ir.v/'.' ' Â¦. \(i- %
The treaty of the Hague, : which we believe is : :.nqt>i :
yet ratified, provides that when; We party to a contest;
requests another nation to tender its good! 6ffices;in ;
effecting peace, the nation sq requested may . rnalce!
such tender to thf other party, which is free to accept
or refuse, as it pleases. '. - Â¦Â¦ :,-; -,- .

"It. behooves you to consider who shall
manage, the State campaign this year."
A resolution, recently adopted by the
Iroquois ! Club, was: read., It enjoined the
committee .to â¢ '.recognize clubs In
the choice â¢ of,.- delegates to the
convention. The -expression was so al
luring that J.'. J: Â¦Â¦ Dwyer, â¢ National Com
mitteeman, asked' for a second reading.
No comment other than that expressed
by Mr. Dwyer. was uttered. Not even
a third reading was demanded.'
Silence ensued. Ultimately it was*
broken by Mr. Dwyer, who remarked
that the best thing to do was to suggest
nothing to the State Central Committee.
It was highly dangerous, in view -of the
existing condition of affairs Democratic,
to discuss plans to be considered by : the
State Central Committee next Saturday.
It was not in his judgment necessary for
Democrats to invent new plans. Old
plans and precedents, such as Thomas
Jefferson established, were good enough.
Mr. Dwyer spoke well of Mr. Jefferson.
Any plan adopted by this committee will
be denounced as a programme.
â¢ "On some occasions,' remarked- Mr.
Dwyer, "programmes are justifiable." Â¦â¢Â¦
Mayor Phclan smiled his approval. In
a generalisense Mr.- Dwyer spoke well of
programmes. --"
- Ex-Governor Budd put- In this inquiry:
"May I ask the- gentleman a question?
Have we any right under the rules of
the convention of 189S to do more than fix
the apportionment and designate a' time
and place for holding the convention?"
Chairman Mann read the rules adopted
in 1898, and > the reading attested the ex
cellent memory of the ex-Governor.
- Mayor Phelan coincided Â¦ with the view
expressed by National Committeeman
Dwyer, and asked to be excused to at
tend a meeting of the Board of Super
visors. Consent was given by silence.
It was late in the afternoon when J."
L. Gallagher arose. He agreed â¢ partly
with Mr. Dwyer. He did not indorse the
view that â¢ plans ought not to be dis
cussed. " . : Â¦ ' '
W. H. Alford. -the eloquent immigrant
from Tulare. who settled in the District
Attorney's office under the new charter,
remarked â¢ that, discussion . would be idle
unless an official plan was submitted. â¢Â¦

was thoroughly In -accord with Mr.

Commerce with Louisiana as external territory went
on for a year, and then Congress extended thereto
the revenue law of the United States and the follow
ing laws of the Union and no others: An act to es
tablish the Treasury Department; to enroll and li
cense ships; for the compensation of treasury of
ficers; for the recovery of debts due, by individuals
to the United States; to provide for settlement of
accounts between the United States and accounting ,
officers; to authorize the sale and conveyance of land
by United States Marshals; to remit fines and for
feitures; to establish a mint, and to regulate the value
of foreign coins. . \
Surely that was not- a very sumptuous extension of
the principles' of the constitution, and, such as it was,
it was withheld for a year after annexation, and if one
year it might have been withheld twenty years.
Louisiana was continental territory, sparsely inhab
ited, with physical features not widely differing from
territory already in our possession. If the extension
of any part of our laws and constitution to it was de
ferred for a year, when expressly stipulated in the
treaty, where is the need of hasteHn making such ex
tension :to tropical islands and. people, some of ithenv
8000 miles away, when no treaty. stipulation requires
it? . * â¢ .; ' -'. ; â¢ ;...--.â¢ .âÂ¦â¢"/..
What is the covert and ulterior purpose, of "those
who are urging such haste? Why. do they! read into
the' treaty of! Paris- what was omitted from: it?.' And
why, above all, are they so anxious to, admit the
.Democratic" position" as to that treaty.?' -*. -â¢;Â¦ .:
NTIL now the country has accepted Webster's
I I exposition of the Federal constitution. His
J fame was won as the expounder of the funda
mental law, and it has not been suspected that his
method of construction, applied -to it in body or in
detail, was devised as an expedient merely. On the
other hand, it has been believed that his exposition
was derived from the spirit and letter of the constitu
tion itself, and that his construction was the logical
development of principles .inherent in the instrument.
In his speech of February 24, 1S49, Webster said:
"I do not say that while we sit here to make laws for.
these territories we are not bound by everyone of
the great principles which are intended as general se
curities for public liberty. But they do not exist if
territbries till introduced, by authority of act of Cop
.â¢gress.'V;- :';-.vv : Â¦ V;v; â¢Â¦: ;
The Chronicle is. engaged in a debate with Webster,
and begins its argument by insisting that his view of
the constitution was influenced by. his opposition to
slavery- In fact, it accuses him of talking external
principles in the constitution to serve a political pur
pose, instead of deriving from the constitution its in
herent principles, let their application fall' where it
might. ;
The Whig and Republican parties were founded
mostly on 4 Webster's exposition of the constitution.
If it be true that in one instance he talked principles
into that instrument that are not inherent, then his
entire exposition of it is tainted and untrustworthy.
Not accepting the Chronicle's ascription of false mo
tive to Webster, The Call insists that his contention
was correct. Being correct, we deny that the treaty
of Paris extended the constitution over Porto Rico
and the Philippines and made them a constitutional,
integral part of the United States. As it did not,
and as Congress only has authority to introduce the
principles of the constitution into those islands, it may
extend one at its will, or -withhold all at its will.-
This is its right under the only possible interpretation
of Webster's exposition. :
.The Chronicle says: .'.'The plain duty of Congress
is to recognize the limitations of the constitution and
its ; power,, and at the. earliest practicable moment pass :
laws whifch will. give, such of the. inhabitants of the
Philippines as we '-hayejinadc citizens of the United
States" b^y .-annexation all;; the benefits and immuni
ties of the.constitutibn : ;".- : 'Â¦' _. ; K". : V- Â¦ ''Â¦]â¢ . >'
; . In that statement, is the; field * <i>f the controversy.
The Chronicle desires the party to take
the ground, that :?. annexation conferred citizenship;;
upon fifteen. minions of people in the . Philippines and.
Porto Rico!. ..That is the position taken by iBryan ;
and Jones, the chairman of his committee;. !. The 1 ;
Chronicle, inserts -a confiisirig ..compli;catio.n.in the:
phrase, ."-Which- will give .':siich 6f the inhabitants Jts

of Paris especially â¢ omits. mention.. bf citizenship 1 .or.liU : :

That omission was. not: accidental.! It was=inten-:;
tional. Louisiana was purchased and acquired by
treaty made at Paris in 1803. Article III of 'that,
treaty says: "The inhabitants of the ceded territory,
shall be incorporated into the Union .of the United
States, and admitted as soon as possible, according to
the principles, of the Federal constitution, to. the en
joyment of all the rights, advantages and immunities
of citizens of the United States, and in the. meantime
they shall be maintained in the free enjoyment of their
liberty, property and the religion which they profess."
There is no such clause in the treaty of Paris of
1898. It "does riot incorporate the islands and the
islanders in the Union of the United States. â¢ '..'-
The treaty, made with Spain for the purchase of
Florida contains the same clause and stipulation as
that for the purchase of Louisiana. . . ,Â¦ '
If bare annexation incorporates land and people
into the Union of the United States, why did Jef

THE CHRONICLE AND WEBSTER.
Of course the Bryanites will immediately resume
their declarations in favor of the- canal. Their
organs will scream in. circus poster type for a speedy
construction of it. The politicians will put it in the
party platform, and the yellow organs will nail it to
the mast as a part of the yellow programme. Se
cretly, however, a good many of those politicians and
most of the yellow organs wiU : again conspire to de
feat any. Nicaragua canal bill; that may be presented;
The. trick that has been played this year will be played;
over again with variations next year. This time the
Hay-Pauncefote treaty has made an. excuse for'de
feating it: Next: year some other excuse will.-be
found:- : : : ; . Â¦ -i ,' ; i.^y ; .; . -v^ '.
: ;.The one satisfactory feature of the situation is :.that';
the intelligence 1 of the : people has how discerned. the-,
methods of. the opposition- and the public will be on.;

done what it tpuld. to hasten the construction ibrthe

It is now evident that many who pretend to be
supporters of the construction of the canal are ready
to work against it whenever an excuse serves. Their
pretended friendship -is. only a cloak which .enables
them to ; act with more efficiency against the enter
prise by acting secretly. -These hypocritical foes of
the canal were loud >in declaring themselvesin favor
of it- a short time ago,- but as soon. as they perceived
that the bill was likely to pass they suddenly turned
against it, and under a-show of opposition to the
Hay-Pauncefote treaty have succeeded in having the
Avhole enterprise indefinitely postponed.
= The fight against the *tr eat y was made most vo
ciferously by the Bryanites, who thought they saw in
it an opportunity to make a point against the adminis
tration for use in the coming campaign. These politi
cians and their organs readily and even eagerly com
bined with the transcontinental railroads in the fight
against the treaty and the canal. The- combination,
it seems, has been sufficiently strong to obtain at
least a temporary victory. They have defeated' all
chance of passing the, measure at .this session, and
are in a good position' to defeat it again next winter.
REPORTS from are to the effect
that while the Nicaragua canal bill. will prob
â¢ably pass the House to-day,; it will go no f"r
ther at this session of Â¦ Congress, : as the . Senate ' will
not take it. up. Thus, despite the favorable prospects
of the early .days of the session, the opponents of. the
enterprise have achieved another victory. The de
sire of the people has been once more baffled. At
least another year will go by before the bill can be
passed/and as the next session of Congress. .will be
a short one, the hopes for success in that year have
but little foundation on which to rest. ;

The cxtent'of the benefits which will accrue to the
community by the. final passage and adoption of the
order can hardly be overestimated. I The records of
the Police Courts and the Morgue reveal something
but not all of the fearful blight that track gambling
has been to San Francisco. Not all who have fallen
Â¦under the curse of the gamblers have appeared either
cs criminals in the" courts or as ' suicides at the

have been carried by. the influence bf c gambling into
many a home of whose bitterness the public knows
nothing. The amount that. is known,* however,, is
enormous, and when people recall the* appalling
record of the effects of track gambling during the la^t
two years there will -lie found ample cause for .wide
spread rejoicing over the action of yesterday. There
remains now only for the board to complete the work

V. PROCESS ENGRAVING.
In the older methods of producing en
gravings on wood or copper or steel, for
really good results the engraver must be
to some extent an artist. An engraving
made entirely by hand has possibilities
for good or bad that do not belong to the
mecnanlcal processes, and a good wood or
steel engraving has a character all its
own that can be attained in no other* ay
In many respects it is as individual as
a painting. Such engravings, however,
are both rare and expensive, and It Is
principally because of this and because
at the growing desire for good copies of
artistic things that- the various photo
graphic processes have been developed.
These processes, moreover, ate very rapid.
A picture that an engraver would be
weeks in doing by hand can be produced
in a few hours, and the photographic copy
will be Infinitely better than a poor copy
made by hand. The process picture will
be faithful, photographically subject to
the faults of the photograph; but these
faults can be avoided or neutralized to a
great extent by skillful handling, both In
photographing the original and in the sub
sequent treatment of the plate. .
There are so many processes that It is
impossible to treat all of them In the lim
its of this article. But one will be re
scribed, thereforeâ the one usually known
as the half-tone process. It is the most
common, and its products are the most
a The a pfocess plate is printed as type is
printed, the raised portions carrying the
ink and making the impression. In this
respect it differs from the engraving on
steel or copper. In which the ink Is car
ried in the cuts, the raised portions being
wiped clean. Some method had to be used,
therefore, which would produce a plate in
which tho portions to be printed in black
would be left raised. Moreover, since
everv printed part is as black as every
other printed part, the half-tones must
be made up of the right proportions of
dead black and clear white. The effect of
a photographic negative or a print from
such a negative. In which the tones are
produced by different density of deposit,
cannot be exactly copied In printers' ink.
The effect is approximated by the use of
a "screen."
The Half-Tone Screen.
This screen consists of a great number
of lines ruled upon glass. Usually the rul
ing Is such that the space between adja
cent lines is of the same width as each
line and- the lines cross each other at
right angles. More complicated arrange
ments of lines are sometimes used, but
they present. little if any advantage. The
ruling is of course done by machinery
and is then covered by another glass as a
mechanical protection against injury.
Such an arrangement of lines produces
curious effects. Look at a street light
through an umbrella or a handkerchief
and It appears to be spread out in a klnrt
of chocked pattern. This is not exactly
the effect of the half- tone, screen as it i3
used in practice, but it is somewhat simi
lar. â¢ ' \ Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦ Â¦â¢"Â¦'"'Â¦
The fineness of the ruling on the half
tone screen is adjusted in accordance with
the work to be done. A plate which is to
be printed with care on special paper may
be made with a fine screen. 150 lines to the
inch, or possibly even finer than that. The
RECENT SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES.
The general fault of a half-tone plate as
it comes from the acid bath is a lack of
vitality or contrast, a slight muddlne?a of
tone or an abruptness at the edpes. This*
can be remedied in either of two ways,
both of them hand work. Further etching
can be carried on in any desired parts by
the use of the acid brush, diminishing th<*
size of the minute copper points and thus
clearing up the high lights or softening
the edges. The second method la the uso
of the 'regular graver's tools, 'cutting the
surface of the plate in lines of greater or
less regularity, to obtain tho desired gra
dations of tone in the different parts.
ThÂ»Â»5e engraved lines are. of course, quite
evident tn the print. Th!a method In tho
hands of a skillful enirraver produces the
most artistic effects. The best resultÂ« are
seen on the pages of magazines of taa
higher class.
When the negative has been obtained In
this way. developed, washed artd dried,
the film Is placed in contact with a sensi
tized plate of copper or zinpâ the copper
for the finer workâ under considerable
pressure and exposed to sunlight as in or
dinary photographic printing. After treat
ment the copper plate shows, an enamel
like coating at the points, which are final
ly to print black, and the space between
these points is clear. The edges of the*
copper plate are then varnished to pro
tect them against the action of the add.
and the plate is ready to be etched. This
is done by rocking It ina bath of arid,
which eats away the^^TTftpper surface
wherever it Is unprotected and leaves the
parts which are covered with the enamel
like deposit raised to the original level.
These raised parts will thus take, the ink
from the roller and print black. The plate
is removed from the acid occasionally, if
the etching Is long continued, to tent -It
and to protect the small raised points
from undercutting by the acid.
The Process.
In making the photograph the original,
whatever it may be, is very strongly Illu
minated either by arc lights or by sun
light, so that all reflections are avoided.
The grating or half-tone screen is a short
distance in front of the plate. The effect
can be varied by changing the distance;
but the distance must not be too great
nor must the plate and screen be in con
tact. The light forming the image, which,
without the screen, would produce an or
dinary negative, bends around the fine
lines of the grating and produces a nega
tive in which there are minute patches
of light or clear spots and of dense de
posit. The light from a very bright point
In the object- will .bend so completely
about the fine lines of the grating that
their presence is not evident at all. A less
bright point permits the intersections of
the grating lines to show as small dots
which may be connected by line lines, or
mav not, according to the brightness.
Still less light shows as small circles, op
posite the openings in the screen, and the
size of these circled depends also upon
the brightness. The cut shows the ap
pearance, very greatly magnified, of a
portion of a print by this process. The ef
fect of such an appearance, without mag
nification, is a continuous graduation
from dense black to clear white.
finer the screen the more perfect the tones
which it produces. For newspaper work,
on the other hand, where the printing
must be done without great care and on
coarse paper, a coarse screen must ba
used, perhaps not more than fifty or sixty
lines to the inch. A fine plate would sim
ply fill up with Ink, and none of its tine
gradations of tone show at all.
What Glaus Spreckels Prophesied for. the
Valley Road in 1895.
the new road was held February 20, 1S95,
and the following board of directors was
elected: Claus Spreckels, John D. Spreck
els, W. F. Whlttier. J. B. Stetson. Robert
Watt,. A. H. Payson, Charles Holbrook.
Lewis Gerstle, Alvinza Hayward and
Thomas Magee. The first officers of the
road were: Claus Spreckels, president;
W. F. Whitticr, first vice president; Rob
ert Watt, second vice president; Alexan
der Mackle. secretary; W. B. Storey, chief
engineer. â¢ â
From the outset the work was pushed
as rapidly as possible. The San Fran
cisco and San Joaquin Valley Railway,
which was the name chosen, received the
encouraging aid of many communities and
the membership of the old Traffic Asso
ciation, the North American Navigation
Company and the Merchants' Shipping
Association, all of which had been en
gaged in establishing competition, lent
their assistance. The first contract for
grading was let July 8, 1S95. From then on
the construction work was continuous.
The subsequent history of the road -Is
well known. ; ...
The road was completed from Stockton
to Bakersfleld and for a time it was oper
ated as a local road. Then it was pur
chased by the Santa Fe, which has filled
In the gap between Stockton and this city
with rail and ferry service and is now
actually operating from Chicago to San
Francisco over its own lines. From the
enormous benefits that Southern Califor
nia has derived from railway competition
it may safely be inferred the development
of Central California that will follow the
coming of the Santa Fe to San Francisco
will be pronounced. The following dis
patch was received last night:

for recalling the events which led up_ 10
the institution of railway competition
north of Tchachapl. That was not accom
plished at once nor with great ease. The
Southern Pacific Company ,. was so
strongly entrenched in this State., finan
cially and as a transportation monopoly,,
that several attempts to deliver the btate
by means of the construction of a compet
ing road signally failed. Not- until Claus
Spreckels lent his commanding Influence
to the establishment of a competing rail
way was there any real probability that
the Southern Pacific would be disturbed
In long years of monopoly. The Traffic
Association of California, an organization
of merchants, had been formed in 1891
and had accomplished much good, open-
Ing the way to competition by sea
and had attempted to raise the necessary
funds successively, for a road from San
Francisco to Salt Lake City and for a
road through the San Joaquln Valley, be
ginning at Stockton and ending at Ba
kersfield. In 1&94 the chance for final
success appeared to-be very poor. But on
January 17, 1S95, It having come to the
knowledge of some of the executive com
mittee of the Traffic Association that
Claus Spreckels thougnt favorably of the
establishment of a competing railway, a
call for a meeting of all Interested In the
project was Issued by Isaac Upham, pres
ident of the Traffic Association, to be
held in the rooms of the Chamber of Com.
mfirce on the afternoon of January 22,
1895.
The memory of that historic meeting
will still cause the blood of those who.
were present to tingle. The despondency
which had long obtained was suddenly
displaced by buoyant hope and a cer
tainty that at last there would be a com
peting railway. Before the meeting was
adjourned a committee was appointed to
Bolicit subscriptions, the committee con
sisting of Claus Spreckels. Alexander
Bovd.i James D. Phelan. O. D. Baldwin,
Daniel Meyer. W. F. Whlttier, Albert Mil

John T. Doyle and E. F. Preston. Also,
before the meeting closed. Claus Spreckels
subscribed $00,000. and there were many
offers of considerable subscriptions. The
next day the committee met, and on the
following day the news was given out that
Claus Spreckels had subscribed $500,000.

TWENTY LESSONS IN FRENCH CONVERSATION
Copyright, 1900, hy Seymour Eaton.
Alfred Heslop- and J. R. Savory are
Joint owners of the pleasure yacht
Juanito. but. as they were unable to agree
as to whom should be entitled to the cus
tody of both halves of the vessel, the
court has been called upon to settle the
dispute. Heslop alleges that Savory has
denied him the privilege "of enjoying the
usÂ© of the craft and prays the court to
order Its sale so that the proceeds may be
divided between the defendant and him
self. ---Â¦ -

The Continental Building and Loan As
sociation filed suit yesterday In the
United States Circuit Court against A- K.
Coney to recover $6500 on a promissory
note secured by mortgage. < â¢- , ;
Suit for Foreclosure Filed.
Eight weeks of wearisome, somnolesccnt
â¢teslhnony were given a quietus yesterday
morning in the Fair case. By stipulation
of attorneys It was agreed to allow a
condensation of evidence relating to the
pencil deeds, evolved in the trial of the
case of Angus versus Craven, to go into
the record of the present case.
Judge Troutt showed a unanimity with
the counsel of both sides. One hundred
days' were consumed In the former trial
over the pencil deeds and a wealth of tes
timony was inscribed by Court Reporter
George Smith. Later on when a tran
script on appeal was prepared, Smith con
densed the testimony and it is this synop
tlcaJ abbreviation wuich will be read into
the case of Mrs. Nettle R. Craven vs. the
heirs of James G. Fair.
The morning' session of the trial was
given over to a wholesale Introspection of
i stipulations. Attorneys for the respond
ents were desirous of reading into the rec
ord all the material evidence j In regard
to the deeds. With saving- objections the
petitioner's representatives agreed and
now Court Reporter Smith will have to
work 1400 odd pages of typewritten testi
mony into the case. Supplementary and
new matter will, of course, be worked in
to the trial also /rora time to time. At
present the signature of the marriage
contract is under investigation. In the
near future the Grand Opera-house note,
"Do you know your name, James G.
Fair? :> will be experted and then chiro
graphy will be relegated and place given
to human, breathing testimony.
The afternoon session found Expert
Ames on the stand and he declared that
the signature to the marriage contract
was altogether dissimilar from all the
other attested signatures on checks ad
mitted to carry the genuine handwriting
of the deceased millionaire. The testimony
was all of loops, circular lines, shades,
dots, flat tops, connecting lines, hesitat
ing strokes, blind loops and a wealth of
other , technical chirographlcal stuff that
is meant to convince the Judge that the
contract signature is a forgery. Ames
got as far as the F in the surname and
then the court adjourned until to-day at
10:30 a, m. Â¦Â¦

TRANS-ATLANTIC TRAVELERS
Furnished Special attendants by the
Pennsylvania System.
The bureau of attendants for trans-Atlantic
travelers established In Jersey City and New
York City twenty years ago by the Pennsyl-
vania System, has proven a great convenience
to persons making European trips and to
tourists arriving in America at that port. It
will be particularly convenient for visitors to
the Paris Exposition because the departure
docks of most of the Atlantic Steamship Lines
are convenient to the new Jersey City Passen-
per Station of the Pennsylvania Railroad
Company.
This bureau consists of experienced agents
whose duties are to meet passengers arriving
In Jersey City and New York over the Penn-
sylvania Lines and assist them' In arranging
for trans-Atlantic trips via any of the steam-
ehip lines by conducting them to steamships
and aiding in preparations for a trip abroad.
These agents will provide rabs operated by
the Pennsylvania System and aid passengers
with their baggage. They are fully posted on
matters pertaining to steamships leaving New
York, and arrangements can be made through
them for procuring steamship tickets In ad-
vance.
They also meet Incoming steamships to aid
travelers In shaping details for continuing
Journeys from New York over the Pennsyl-
vania Lines by furnishing tickets, arranging
for the transfer of baggage from steamship
docks after it has been passed by customs ln-
Bpectors, and having the same checked through
to destination. They will reserve sleeping car
accommodations and relieve persons of the
foregoing details, making themselves useful as
attendants and guides free of charge.

AVti' York Stock Market... ;
NEW YORK. April 20.â The day on the
stock market started oft with another attempt
to nifh up prices by speculative manipulation
with the purpose of attracting: an outside fol
lowing, but the ghcst Interest had bevn so
far eliminated by the event* of the latter part
of laÂ« week 'that there was not sufficient de
mand from that source to keep up prices.
Neither was there, any awakened Interest de
veloped through the commission house*. The
market therefore fell back and became dull
and heavy, but without i>osltlve weakness un
til some of the latter developments, when the
bears Bhowed renewed vigor and sold prices
to the lowest of the day. The violent break
in Sugar was the principal element in the de
cline. That stock sold up to 1214 In the early
dealings anc} recoxered to jhat ngure after a
reaction end then tell away with occasional
spasmodic rallies to 112Â°*, closing only slightly
above that. The news bearing on the stock
consisted of a story from iioston giving elab
orate detr.tis-cf the alleged terms of the set
tlement of the trade "war and the expressed
opinion of a prominent speculator Just before
Falling for Europe that the war was settled.
Several of the principals in the trade conflict
denied the allegations during the day: The
threatened strike on the New York Central
caused a "all of 2'*i points In that stock and
hid a sympathetic effect elsewhere In the list.
M.ssouri I-"aolnc was push*/ up to CO on ru
xnorc that a dividend wouid be declared at
Â«o-day'8 meeting of the directors and that
John I>. Rockefeller would be admitted to the
directorate. Both rumors failed to he con
firmed by the event and the 6to<*k fell back,
but saved a small net gain. The steel In
dustrials after some show of. weakness also
became firm and closed generally with a
email net gain. The only developments bear-
Ing on the group were rumo?Â« regarding the

Otherwise the market generally yielded to the
reactionary tendency and "closed very near the
lowest and easy in ton*.' There were no de
velopments of Importance in the money or
exchange market. â¢ though both were scanned
wllh eager interest. Discounts In London and
sterling exchange here were slightly easier,
but Londcn has to prepare for a 10 p*r Â«*nt
Installment of the (government loan, which
will be taken up this week. The tightening
of the London money market and the demand
Xor exchange in New York to pay the Install
ment of American subscription will all tend
toward puld exports.. The money market here
continues easy and f.h"ws no sign cf harden
ing, notwithstanding the diminished supply of
cash for the market on sub-treaaury opera
tions. It is worthy., of remark in this con
nection that Saturday's treasury statement at
Washlnirton *!.owt-d an excess of receipts over
expenditure for the day of H.T.21.O1. thus ma

CLOSING,
o'clock, when a futile attempt was made to
Improve prices. New York came heavy and
fagged until the close. Tlntos fell 7-1S in con
sequence of the Paris settlement, and on sales
Anacondas sympathized. Call money was in
(food demand, heavy installments of West, Aus
tralian copper loans falling due. Bills were
steady, but had a slightly easier tendency. The
bank renewed some loans and did a goo 3 dis
count buslnee.". The bank bought Â£166.000 gold
in German coin. The exchange will be closed
to-morrow. .

ible?" Miss la Baraque has a very agree
able voice anid her views on the subject
were clear cut and convincing. The fair
lawyer showed by her wide knowledge of
the subject that she had made quite a
study of it and was able to enlighten the
ministers on the much mooted question.
At the outset she told of the statute of
divorce in this State, the number of legal
grounds of separation, and also discussed
the divorce laws of the various States of
the Union. : She contended that divorce
was a moral question rather than a legal
one. Â¦: - Â¦ Â¦ '. â¢Â¦ ... Â¦
At the conclusion of her talk a general
discussion followed, in which Rev;. Hugh
\V. Fraser. Rev. Duncan Monroe and Pro-.'
fessor Landon of the San Anselmo Theo
logical Seminary were the chief speakers.
The latter said that in some sections he
found that some of the Presbyterian minS;
isters are inclined tp have loose views on
the subject and they might profit from the
strict manner in which the Catholic
church regards divorce. Dr. Fraper ,eoh-:
tended that more barriers should be 'put'
up acalnst people who .want to be Â¦Â¦Â¦'di
vorced. It was his belief that the grounds .
for divorce in this State were entirely too
broad.'. . Â¦'. ' ...'-. ' Â¦ Â¦' \ .

irian of the conference. "Â¦Â¦ : ?. ':-': : M V^V'-S'^i
There seemed: to be some confusion at
th^ 6futset : as: to the reason -for con
ference; but- it was generally, tx-iderstood
to mean a readjustment of .the trans-Pa-:;
cific and tr.ariscpntinental.trafflc. The only,
action taken was the appointment of a
cornmlttea composed of representatives of
the various trans-Pacific steamship coin
panfes to talk; over the . faroposltion and to
formulate: definite conclusions, as to What
Is needed.: The cpramlH*? was Instructed
to. report progress thlsrmornlng.^ The
committee : members: are; P. E.. Brown,
Hongkong manager of the Northern Pa
cific Company: General .Manager R. P.
Schwetin -Â¦ of the Pacific Mall Company,
who represents also- the. Occidental and
Oriental and Toyo:..Kiseri: Kaisha lines;
General Agent Dodwell of the Northern
Pacific line; J. 8. Van Bureh, ; manager of
the Toyo Risen Kalsha . lines at Hong
kong: Alexander Center of the Occidental
and Oriental line: A. S. Mihara, Hongkong
representative of: rthe â¢ Nippon "iusen
Kaisha: C. S. Whealler, Hongkong agent
of the Dpwdell line;: J. S- Van Buren of
Â¦Hongkong, and Stoddard Of the Occidental
and Oriental Company. â¢;-:
; The principal matter that the conference
has to consider i3 the inward-bound^ traf
fic 'â¢â¢ to overland .points in the United
States. During the past ten years the de
velopment of the Oriental trade has been
so rapid that steamship lines have multi
plied very rapidly. There are now eight
competing lines and the tonnage has in
creased to such a degree that freight rates
are greatly reduced to many points. It is
now sought to divide the business so that
all of the trans-American roads that con
nect with trans-Pacific steamship lines
may make a profit, instead of cutting
each other's throats, as they claim they
are doing now. The whole scheme is to
beat the Suez canal jcompetttion.
The railroads and steamship lines rep
resented in the present conference are:
Canadian Pacific Railway Company in
connection with the Canadian Pacific
Steamship Company; Great Northern
Rallwav In connection with the Mppon
Yusen Kalsha from Seattle; Oregon Rail
road and Kavi gallon Company in connec
tion with the Northern Pacific Steamship
Company- from Portland: Santa Fe Hall
road Company In connection with the Cal
ifornia And Oriental Steamship Company
from- this: port and Sari Plego. and the
Southern : Pacific Company in connection
with? the Mali.: Occidental and Ori
ental^ and Toyo Kisen Kalaha companies.
The 1 other transcontinental roads repre
sented In the conference are the Rock Isl
and.' Union Pacific, Chicago and North
western. Rio Grande Western and Denver
and Rib Grande. ;;, v. ;^ '; _, , , Â»
The number of important officials at
tending the conference seems to be a sur
prise to. even the local railroad people,
and It is freely predicted that the results
will be Important, The proposition Is a
hew. one, butit Is generally understood
and generally appreciated. '. .

Tivoli Opera-house last night to. a crowd
ed house. The audience was delighted
with the â¢ sparkling music and beautiful
scenery and costumes, and showed its
appreciation by liberal .applause. The
house seemed to never tire of the "Star

himself and associates had to beg off.
