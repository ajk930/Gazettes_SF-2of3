The American ship Sea Witch left Wal

March 9.
LONDON, May 3.â It has been learned
by a representative of the Associated
Press that Trnlted States Kmbassador
Choate has asked Lord Salisbury for ex
planation? as to the alleged abuse of in
ternational rights in the case of the Amer
ican ship Sea Witch, which, according
to the statement of her commander. Cap
tain Howe, was boarded by the British
warship Wasp v.ithln the three-mile limit
of Portuguese territory Jn Enst Africa.
The American Embassador's communi
cation to the Premier hardly amounts to
a protest and serious complications are
not likely to ensue. The case, as trans
mitted by Secretary Hay to London, con
sists of the captain's allegation that
while the Sea Witch was off Delagoa Bay
he signaled to the Wasp, which was pa
trolling, and the Wasp sent a boat to her.
The captain of the Sea Witch complains
that the visit resembled a warlike board
ing party and that his manifest was ex
amined against his will when palpably
within. neutral waters. If the latter state
ment i3 true, a serious offense has been
committed by the Wasp, which will call
for an ample apology from Great Britain.
But it is pointed out that the fact that
the Sea Witch signaled th'e Wasp before
the warship noticed her invests the case
with a curious uncertainty. Apparently
both Mr. Choate and Lord Salisbury^ are
inclined to believe that there is some mis
take, perhaps on both sides. The Premier
has referred the matter to the Admiralty,
which has no record of the occurrence,
but has cabled to South Africa for the
Wasp's version of the affair and It is pos
sible that some time may elapse before
the British reply is ready.
* In the meantime the incident does not
Interfere in the slightest degree with the
cordiality existing between the represen
tatives of the two nations Interested.

LONDON, May 3.â The War Office has
received the following dispatch from Lord
Roberts dated Bloemfontejn, May 2:
"General Hamilton met with consider
able success and drove the enemy out of
the strong position they had taken up at

us. The Boers dispersed In several direc

"During the afternoon General Ian
Hamilton was joined by j General Bruce

"The enemy, admit having twelve killed
and forty wounded yesterday. Among
the former was Lieutenant Gunther, a
German officer belonging to the Fifty

Later in the afternoon General Delarey
learned that the British, had forced their
way twenty miles east of Brandfort and
seven miles north of the Modder River.
With 250 men Delarey set out in pursuit
of the British, who numbered 1200. The
forces met in the open country, a sharp
engagement followed and the British re
tired. As the Boers had a heavy day they
were not pursued. The Federals had five
men wounded.
An American has been arrested in con
nection with the Begbie explosion.
THE people of this city and State have won another signal triumph through the agency of The Call.
This paper undertook to expose the operations of the gigantic ring which in this city has landed thou
sands upon thousands of Chinese, many of them entering San Francisco clothed with the dignity of
American citizens. The first result of the expojse made by The Call was the remarkable admission made by
Collector of the Port John P. Jackson that after creating three thousand native-born American citizens he
had no authority to create one, and announced his decision to wash his hands of any further participation in
the shameful traffic.
Yesterday morning The Call exposed the outrageous slave trade which a ring of lawyers, assisted by
the ignorance or connivance of men in high places, maintains at this port. The corrupt and illegal partici
pation in this traffic of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company was also shown. This paper rsvealed the out
rageous fact that the Pacific Mail Steamship Company is reaping an ill-gotten monthly harvest of a thousand
dollars by landing, contrary to the laws of the United States, hundreds of Chinese. As a result of this expose
by The Call Collector of the Port John P. Jackson gave peremptory orders yesterday to the Fsderal officials in
this city that the Chinese illegally detained at the Pacific Mail' Bock be immediately deported and returned
to China. ... -â:â¢,-..,-Â¦. ___â¢, , Â¦Â¦ - - . Â¦* Â¦Â¦-â¢- Â¦â¢
The officials of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company protested, but the Surveyor of the Port, Joseph
S. Spear, announced that he would carry out the orders of his superior if it required the assistance of, every
officer in the customs service in this city. The Chinese were herded by customs officers and marched upon
the deck of the steamer Rio de Janeiro. The news of the startling^ action taken by the Federal authori
ties spread quickly in Chinatown and the lawyer conspirators, who have made thousands of dollars of profit
by landing coolies in San Francisco, were informed. They instantly proceeded to the United States District
Court and secured writs of habeas corpus for the coolie "native-born" citizens, who were then saved from de-
Notwithstanding the victory which has thus been won. over a clique of scheming lawyers and com
placent officials, the reform of the Chinese traffic at this port has only begun. In order that the exposure may
be absolutely complete and that the operations of this powerful ring, may be stopped The Call again defies tha
Collector of this Port, John P. Jackson, either to permit or demand an investigation of the shameful traffic of
Chinese under his administration. The Collector of the Port has in his possession records which belong to the
public and which should be produced for public inspection. He is also without records which should* be in his
office as a guarantee that the admission of Chinese by him has been legitimate. The Call therefore defies him
to ask an investigation of Chinese business or to permit this paper to make one. **,,
m Federal officials at this port seem to have been laboring under the impression that the detention shed
at the Pacific Mail Dock, out of which the Pacific Mail Steamship Company has made thousands upon thou
sands of dollars, is constructively the deck of the vessel upon which Chinese come to this port. Collector
Jackson, through his action yesterday, evidently disagrees with his subordinates in San Irancisco and the
agents of the Pacific Mail. The duty of the United States District Attorney, Frank I*. Coombs, appears there
fore to be plain. The law declares that any master of a vessel and any responsible agent of a steamship com
pany who permits a Chinese, illegally, to leave a vessel upon which he arrives at an American port shall be
subject to a fine of five hundred dollars or imprisonment for one year for every Chinese he so permits to leave
a vessel. Does the United States District , Attorney intend to prosecute the responsible representatives of the
Pacific Mail Steamship Company for permitting to land the Chinese who were ordered deported yesterday?
THERE was lively interest In Chj
nese Immigration matters yesterday
afternoon at the Mail dock and in
the United States Appraisers 1 build
ing.' The Pacific Mall Steamship Com
pany's steamship Rio de Janeiro had
been advertised to leave for the
Orient at 1 p. m., and at noon Chief Dunn
of the Chinese Bureau notified Customs
Surveyor Spear that - the Treasury De
partment had ordered the deportation of
sixty-eight Chinese immigrants who had
failed to effect a landing. Some of these
were awaiting deportation and the re
mainder, about thirty-six, claiming to be
American citizens, could not be .landed
because Collector Jackson refused to
touch their cases . even with a pair .of
chopsticks. He declared that he had
washed his hands, in soda water of the
whole native-born business.
When the agents of the steamship com
pany learned of the order they vehe
mently protested. They alleged that all
their steerage passenger space had been
taken up for freight, and that they had
no room for the coolies. All their protes
tations, however, were in vain, for Sur
veyor Spear declared that he would carry
out the order of the Treasury Depart
ment even if he had to employ the ,. whole
force of the Custom-house to put the Chi
nese on board the Rio.
Accordingly, Customs Inspector Leary
and a posse ran the native born, the mer
chants and the section 6 men from the
detention shed to the deck of the steamer
and announced that not one of them
would be allowed to leave the vesseP ex
cept by virtue of a writ of habeas corpus.
The usual coterie of Chinese lawyersâ
Pippy... Bell.: Strauss, Worley. McGowan,
Madden and Schaertzerâ were at once
notified of the condition of affairs and
immediately made arrangements to ob
tain writs of habeas corpus. A typewriter
was employed to reel off carbon copies of
the writs, while the whole force of law
yers with the exception of Colonel Pippy,
were busy In the clerk's office of the
United States District Court filing. In the
blanks for the native son casesâ the only
ones who could 'avail themselves of the
benefit of habeas corpus. As fast as the
papers were filled and sworn to by the
usual gany of Chinese uncles, cousins and
brothers, they were taken before Judge
de Haven, who issued writs directed to
the agents of the steamship company, re
turnable forthwith. Several writs .were
denied ! because some of the blanks were
not properly filled out. In such cases, new
petitions were : drawn -up and Â¦ the errors
and omissions corrected.
"^At 4 " o'clock ." the last^of ' the } writsâ
thirty-six in numberâ had been placed, In
the handa oi the United States Marshal
and served upon the steamship company's
officers.
The^ division of the cases among the at
torneys were as follows: Bell. IS: Strauss,
4; Madden, 6; .McGowan, 4; Schaertzer. 3,
and Worley, 3. The cases will be taken
to-day before United States Court Com
missioner Heacock.
On account of the delay caused by the
Issuance of the writs, the. Rib did not sail
at 1 p. m., as advertised, but at 5:20 p. m.
In discussing the Chinese traffic and the
remarkable action taken by Collector of
the Port- John -P.,. Jackson yesterday.
United States District Attorney Frank L.
Coombs spoke as follows: . â¢< . .. Â¦- . . s
'"This office has no .original jurisdiction
over any case that has not passed'the Col
lector of the Port." The procedure in the
case of Chinese desiring Uo'land is this:
They are first examined by the officials of
the Chinese Bureau; then â¢ the recom
mendation'of the bureau is made to the
Collector, and he lands or rejects the Chi
nese as he sees fit. In all that proceeding
this office has nothing to do. We cannot
interfere In the work of the Chinese Bu
reau, nor can we advise the Collector un
less he asks our advice, and even then he
is not bound to act upon it. Should the
recommendation of the Chinese Bureau be
that the applicant should be allowed to
land, then, if the Collector allows him or
her to land, we can take the matter up If
we see a chance that the Chinese is Ille
gally in this country. If the Collector de
nies the application, then, if the case is
brought into court, this office takes up the
side of the United States and defends the
action.
"In those cases where the Collector al
lows the applicant to land we can have
the Chinese ordered into the custody of
the United States Marshal while we show
that he or she. is illegally in the country,
and then we can secure an order of court
deporting the defendant to China. In this
case, of ..Wai. Ho, which you mention this
morning, there is nothing so far that
justifies this office in interfering. It must
pass the Collector before we can do any
thing. I know nothing of this particular
case, but if the recommendation of the
Chinese Bureau be that she be landed it
still must, be passed upon by the Col
lector. If he disregard the recommenda
tion and orders the woman back to China
we have nothing to do with the case un
less she brings â¢ habeas corpus proceed
ings. If he allows her to land we can
take the matter up upon the suggestion cf
any one. -I do not ask that proof of her
fraud Is necessary. nor.do I ask that there
be even a probability. > All I want Is that
some reasonable . doubt of her right to
remain in this country exists and I will
take the case up and prosecute it vfz
orously. --/..-â¢
"The presence of a list of coach ques
tions in any case seema to me to be
sufficient to prove that the applicant is
not entitled to land, and If such a list
could be produced in the case of this
woman I have no doubt she could be de
ported. If The Call will furnish me with
its information I will proceed vigorously
with the case whenever it cornea within
the Jurisdiction of this office."
Mr. Coombs declared that his office has
no original jurisdiction over any case that
has not passed the Collector of the Port.
Mr. -Coombs Is aware that the Collector
of the Port, after the expose made by The
Call, decided that he had no Jurisdiction
whatever over Chinese who applied for
admission as native-born citizens,. Mr
Coombs is aware that during the month"
of April three vessels arrived at this port
âthe China, the Doric and the Nippon
Maru. Upon the China there were forty
eight coolies claiming to be "native-born"
citizens of the United States: on the Doric
there were forty-two Chinese making thÂ»
same plea; upon the Nippon Maru thers
were thirty-oneâ a total of 121.
Before the expose of the local traffic in
coolie native sons Collector Jackson Â»*
mined seventeen coolies and made them
citizens of the United States. There re
mained therefore 104 with whom the Col
lector of the Port declined to have any
thing to do and over whom the United

It Is evident to officials familiar with

making preparations for emergencies,
and is keeping her fleet well in hand. At
the present time the Japanese fleet is su
perior to that of Russia, but with the re
inforcements which the latter will send
out it Is apparent that the two forces will
be about equal if hostilities are delayed.

Many Interesting Papers Bead at Los
f=pecial Dtppatch to The Call.
LOS GATOS. May 3.â The Farmers' In
stitute under the auspices of the local:
grange was held to-day in Odd Fellows'
Hall. J. J. Cornell, master of Los Gatos
Grange, presiding. The morning session
was opened with music and a prayer,
after which Professor D. T. Fowler, con
ductor of the Farmers' Institute of North
ern California, was introduced.. He spoke
for a short time on '"Farm Wastes,"
which was followed by an open discussion.
Professor C. W. Wood worth of the en
tomology department of the University of
California, familiarly known as the "Bug
Man." spoke of the winged pests of which
the orchardist is a victim. An open dis
cussion followed his lecture, and after a
recitation an intermission for dinner was
taken.
The afternoon session was opened with
a question box. In which the questions of
grafting. Â¦ fertilizers, growth of moss on
trees and culture of grape vines were
taken "up and disposed of by Professors
Fowler and Woodworth. Professor Fow-,
lerthen compared the advantages of
Northern and Southern California and ex
pressed a hope that the time would come
when this distinction would be done away
with and it would be all simply Califor
nia. He continued, speaking on "The
Farm Home," showing all the, facilities
for modern improvements that are now
within reach of the average farmer that
are not taken advantage of to so great an
extent as in cities.
Professor Woodworth then spoke on
"Our Ladybirds" as thecgreat destroyer
of San Jose scale. Miss Hannah Buckley
rendered a vocal solo and Professor Fow
ler spoke of the good work that the Insti

worth on the use of carbon bisulphide as
an insecticide, and one by Professor Fow
ler on the "Utility of Farmers' Organiza
tion." interspersed with vocal and instru
mental music.
The large attendance and marked inter
est with which the. various discussions
were followed show that the ranchers of
this. section realize that farming is 'a sci
ence, and that many benefits can be de
rived by following It out on scientific lines.

OTIS MAKES LIGHT OF
HIS ASSAULT ON REAM
Says He Attackt d the Reporter With
a Machete in a Pickwickian,
Spirit.
Special Di*iÂ«trh to The CulL
LOS ANGELES. May 3.â At 3 o'clock
this nftornoon Brigadier General Harri
son Gray Otis, who is charged by W. R.
Ream, a reporter, with assault with a
weapon, accompanied by his attorney,
former United States Senator. Stephen
White, appeared in the Police Court for.
examination. By stipulation of counsel,
fes neither party was prepared., the cas*r
v,&s continued until 10 o'clock to-morrow.
The fact ty-day has been established
that the instrument used was a Cuban
machete that had just been received by
Otls as a curio. The Times this morning
contains a burlesque upon what appeared
in. the papers of yesterday afternoon, in
which the assault was described. After
tacetiously referring to the matter the
articic. that is evidently inspired, says:
"It should have hoen stated that all
tfiiF was done in a purely Pickwickian
spirit. The reporter took it altogether too
*<t5ouMv. for hÂ»r must admit that the
Times' manslayer never half does his
work. He ordered his menials to sweep
up the remnants of his victim in a. dust
pan and they are removed to the office
wasteba-'ket. into which so many re
porters' fragments had been dropped be
fore."
In another statement Otis says: "It is
an incident scarcely worthy of serious
treatment; in fact, it is more JikÂ»> opera
bnuffe. I was laughing and smiling dur
ing the entire matter. I admit that I
pressed the point of a curio, a Cuban
"machete, against tbe stomach of the ex
cited reporter, but I deny that it came
out on the other side."
Ream to-night pays that he will preps
the suit and that he does not believe that
any man who woujd abupe him as Grn
<ral Otis did and strike pueh a vicious
blow with a machete can invoke the aid
v,f a Pickwick to remove the effect of what
would have hwn a s'-rious matter had
the weapon been as sharp as the general's
language was cutting.

I.OS ANGELES, May 3.â After a brief,
courtship of twenty-four hours Charles
P. Overton, one of the leading Knight*}
Templar of Golden Gate Commandery No.

Miss Daisy Bell, the accomplished daugh
ter of Major Horace Bell of this city.
Although the now happily married couple
had known each other for many years
not until they, still in single blessedness?,
occupied a box at thf> Orpheum on Tues
day night did the question of matrimony"
have .serious consideration. Vet In that
box Charley Overton. with the sound of
'Lohengrin" In his ears a? the notes of
the orchestra died away, made known
hi? love and slipped the ring that plighted:
ihfir troth upon the hand of his lady fair.
An hour later at Levy's restaurant, where
a party of sixty gallant knights were
dining and making 1 merry at the round
table, in a spirit of jest the proposal qf
marriage was announced. This resulted
in a kiss being given in the presenc-n of
the fraters assembled, the joke becoming
cne of pure earnestness.
The affair was still lightly treated and
the fair knights and ladies took a tally-ho
rtde to I'asadena. When they returned
last night they found that Rev. Hush K.
Walker had performed the ceremony at
the home of the bride and their congrat
ulations were extended as the owl trail 1 ,

The I?gt:s<Â» to-day, without â¢ division,
parsed the free homes bill, which has
been pending before Congress for a num
ber of years. The bill provides that the
Government FhaH Issue patents to actual
bona fide settlers on agricultural lands of
Indian reservations opened to settlement.
These lands were taken up by settlers
who contracted to pay for them $1 25 to
$3 73 per acre. By the terms of the bill
the Government assumes the payment of
the purchase price to the Indians, and
changr-c the existing law relative to agri
cultural colleges so as to insure the pay
ment of the endowments, which hereto
fore have come out of the sale of public
lands, in en?" of deficiency. These pay
ments Involve J1.200/XO annually. Of the
2S.000.CO0 acres in Indian reservations
opened to settlement, for which the Gov
ernment is to pay or has paid JS3,000,0(W,
about s. 000 .000 tcres have been taken and
sb^ut 2/<0\W) ceres are supDosed to be
etill available fcr agricultural purposes.
A rcmaikable thing In connection with
the paKsafre of the bill to-day was a
rrÂ»eeeh in its favor by Gaiusha A. Grow
of Pennsylvania, the venerable ex-Speak
er of the House, who forty-eight years
Rgo fathered and passed the original
homestÂ«Â»nd bill. He was then the young
est and is now the oldest member of the
House. The remainder of the day was
devoted to the sundry civil appropriation
bill, the last but one of the great sup
piy bin*.
Free Homes Bill.
A resolution requesting the Civil Ser
vice Commission to supply the Senate In
formation affirming- violations of the civil
trrvice law in 1^8 was adopted.
The Senate then, at 5:25 p. m., ad
journed.
A bllt. wajs passed restoring Captain
Jlrnry D. Hale to the revenue cutter uer

The Senate then passed 177 private pen

Tiilman criticized the War Department
for not supplying the Information asked
for by the Senate.
Bepljtfns to FeUij?rew'* charge as to
the prevalence of insanity and suicides
xiroons- the soldiers in the Philippines.
Ilawlt-y read a statement from the sur-
Uvcn poneral saying that Insanity had not
Ijron above the average.
If this was true, said Turner. It was
hardly consistent to say. as Proctor had
paid, that therÂ» were only eeattertnr in
stances in which the extra pay had been
alliw'od.
Proctor read extracts from the report
of the adjutant general explaining tilÂ© cir
cumstances under which travel pay had
been aJ lowed to eorae of the troops and
withheld from others. He said that no
military organization as such has received
travel pay from Manila, but that such al
lowance had been made In many Individ
ual cascs. The Astor Battery was com
posed largely. Proctor said, of men In the
rppular army, and on the whole they
tared not so well as Rome of the purely
volunteer organizations.
Turner referred to the fact that a reso
lution had been adopted by the Senate
two months ago asking for a list of sol
diers who had received travel pay. and
that the paymaster greneral had rÂ«*pll*Â»d
that hi? force was Insufficient to supply
th<Â» <1ata during the present session of
Congress.
Travel Pay Allo-wances.

travel pay. Burns that we could maintain

f.i'.ntf a liberal policy. Suppose Jt did cost
S7.000.Gj0. that Tvas a. mere baga-telle com

Teller raid he had been assured by an
army ofllccr who had recently re
turned from the Philippines that we did
not actually hold a district in the Island
cf Luzon blgg-er than the District of Co
lumbia- This was no more territory than,

toestlon this fact aa a crimination against
the Government on thi? account, but. on
the other hand. It was puerile to say that
the money due the troops should be with
held for mere motives of economy.
Tinman and Pcttiprrew had a discussion
ns to fiffalrs In the Philippines. Pettigrrew
coriterifled that no mere fra-gments of a
tribe vicre opposed to the United States In
the Ph!:'.rplr-es, but that the entire popu

Track Notes.
Favorites Out of Luck Again at Oak
land â Jingle Jingle's Win Put
a Crimp in the Betting
Bine
J. Naglee Burk's mare Rosormonde,
with 103 pounds up, captured the' mile and
a sixteenth handicap at Oakland yester
day after a desperate drive with old Cap
tive. She was heavily played at odds of 5
to 2, and after shaking off Constellator It
looked easy for her. In the stretch Boze
man called on Captive, and only by a
clever piece of finishing did Buchanan
land Rosormonde first by a short nose. At
the start Mr. Ferguson seemed to ignore
the even money favorite. My Gypsy, en
tirely, letting the little filly away a half
dozen lengths behind the others. It did
not suit the crowd, which plainly dis
played its disapproval of the careless
work. She was never a factor In the
race.
Outsiders in the betting were again out
on dress parade, Merry Boy and Jingle
Jingle being the bright particular stars.
Two favorites only won purses.
Sidelong, a hot tip for the opening
sprint, was reported lame, sending his
price back from 8 to 5 to *. It proved a
false alarm, for after Polka had led to the
stretch Woods on Sidelong got up. win
ning by half a length. Moscow Boy, the
favorite, quit early.
Frank McMahon's mare Alaria received
heavy backing to win the mile selling run,
closing equal favorite with Good Hope.
Powell had the leg up in place of Faunt
leroy, and slipping through next the rail
on the far turn succeeded in maintaining
his position to the close, leading Cromwell
out two lengths. Buchanan on Good Hope
lost his lead pad at the three-quarter pole.
Mr. Ferguson's bad work with the gate
at the mile and a sixteenth start was re
peated in the six-furlong sprint. Backed
from 8 to 16 to 5, Jingle Jingle was sent
away long before her field, and. hard rid
den, reached the stand four lengths be
fore Mistral II, an outsider. Decoy, the
favorite, and Novia, second choice, never
had a chance.
Another remarkably close finish marked
the conclusion of the mile and a furlong
run. Silver Tone started out to make a
runaway race of it. only to be grabbed
with the wire almost within reach by
Louis B. McWhirter. a 30 to 1 Bhot. Just
about this time Woods brought Rosinante
along with a tardily timed rush, getting
the decision by a nose.
Quoted at 8 and 10 to 1 in th<* ring. Mer
ry Boy < wned Torsina a half-length for
the closing mile run. Ailenna ran third.
My Gypsy, Hot Favorite for
the Handicap, Almost
Left.

MONAHAN
WAS TOO TRUE
TO HIS FRIEND
Made an Affidavit Which
He Now Admits Was
Perjured.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL. May 3.â Friendship for
his convicted friend, firebug Patrick
Boyle, may land Patrick Monahan, who
claims to be an oiler for the Pacific Mail
Steamship Company, behind the bars of a
State's prison, wearing convict stripes for
the crime of perjury.
Two affidavits, each made the same
day, one a direct contraversion of the
other, form the crime which Monahan
has committed, and friendship for Boyle,
he claims, prompted him to the making
of the first affidavit, which sets forth that
the jury which tried Patrick Boyle was
"fixed," and that his charge as set forth
in the affidavit was based on statements
made to him by John Frizzi, one of the
jurors. Frizzi, the affidavit states, told
Monahan that Boyle was to be "found
guilty in any event, whether the Jury felt
he was innocent or not."
District Attorney Mclsaac heard yester
day of the affidavit, which had been
sworn to before S. .W. Augustine, a no
tary public. At the same time: he discov
ered that Monahan had left town, and In
the capacity of piler would sail on yester
day's steamer lor -Honolulu.' Mclsaac dis
patched Constable -George Agnew after.
Monahan, armed wltlva warrant charging
the oiler with defrauding an innkeeper.
Monahan was brought back last night
and confronted with the facts of the ease,
weakened and made a second affidavit,
denying "in toto" all he had stated fn the
first. He also exonerates Frizzi from all
connection with it. He further states that
it is a fabrication made at , the instance
of James and M. F. Cochrane, the former
of whom Is Boyle's attorney. Cochrane,
when seen to-day, denied all knowledge
of the first affidavit, and says he will be
the first to prosecute Monahan for per
jury. District Attorney Mclsaac will
thresh the matter thoroughly, and sensa
tional developments may result.
On cross-examination, Culton said he
did not know of any list of State Sena
tors or Representatives who were to be
put out of the way.
On redirect examination, Culton said
that Sergeant at Arras Haley signed the
subpenaes for. Â¦ witnesses for Governor
Tavlor to testify before, the Gubernato
rial Contest Committee, and" authorized
Culton to secure good men in the various
counties to serve them. Culton said he
did not know where Powers or Youtsey
was when the shot was fired. During the
last talk he had with Youtsey, the latter
said the plan to kill Goebel had been
abandoned. Culton had been asked by
Taylor to ascertain what the witnesses
In "the contest knew because he was a
lawyer. To the prosecution he said he
had told more now on the stand than to
any person, except his father. Here his
testimony ended.
Circuit Clerk Moore of Jackson County
denied that Culton had told him anything
about a plan to bring on a riot and kill
Goebel and other members of the Legis
lature.
Caleb Powers, who was at the confer
ence, telephoned to Governor Taylor at
Frankfort two or. three times in regard
to the conference.
He said, further, that at a conference
in Lexington the Sunday before Goebel
was shot it was decided that Represen
tative Henry Berry, who had been un
seated a few days before, should go to
the -House of Representatives next morn
ing and take his seat and refuse to give
it up. Van Meter, his opponent, -was to
be in some way prevented from going to
the hall that morning.
FRANKFORT. Ky., May 3.â W. H. Cul
ton resumed his testimony in the Goebel
murder investigation to-day. He stated
that Governor Taylor authorized the wit
ness to give Youtsey any amount of
money desired if he would leave Ken
tucky.

FATALITIES AT
SCOFIELD WERE
OVERESTIMATED
List of Dead Will Not Ex
ceed Two Hundred and
Fifty.
A joint committee of Odd Fellows and
Knights of Pythias spent the day among
the dead, identifying members of their
orders. They found about twenty of each
order among the dead. The school chil
dren of this city have gathered a car
load of .'flowers which wiir toe sent to Sco

Subscriptions for the relief of the suf
ferers are coming In from all over the
State and the total now amounts to $13,

The special committee appointed by
Mayor Thompson yesterday to receive
subscriptions to the relief fund met to
day and organized by electing the follow
ing officers: Prtsident, J. E- Dooly; treas
urer. A. L. Thomas; secretary, William
Igleheart. â¢ !
While the committee was in session A.
L. Thompson read a dispatch from Hon.
Henry Phillips of Pittsburg, in which he
expressed deen sorrow for the terrible
disaster and requesting that his name be
put down for $1(W. M. J. Grondersten &
Co. of San Francisco have also contrib
uted $100. *
John Kirton, one of the men brought
out of the mine alive, died to-day.
The body of Foreman Parmley was
found late this afternoon. It was ter
ribly mangled.
Lizzie Clark, who was reported to have
fallen dead at the feet ot" her mother yes
terday upon being informed of the death
of her brother, is still alive, but in a
precarious condition.
A funeral train with bodies of the dead
will leave Scofleld to-morrow morning,
stopping at Spanish Fork, Provo, Ameri
ican Fork, Salt Lake, Ogden, Coalvllle and
one body will go through to Springfield,
Ohio.
The body of Tom lirogdon of North
Lawrenee, Ohio, was located to-day in
mine No. 1. There are not enough coffins
in the camp to bury the dead, and to add
horror to the situation, the bodies are
rapidly decomposing, and it has been sug
gested that cremation may have to be re
sorted to. There are fifty bodies for which
no provision for burial has been made.
SALT LAKE. May 3.â The latest dis
patches from Scolield say that the ex
treme estimate of dead is now conceded
to have been too large and that it is num
erically impossible to place the Iofs of life
at 300, as there v.ere not that many men
in the mines. The probabilities are that
250 Â¦will be about the total number of dead.
Relatives of the victims continue to ar
rive from all the surrounding towns.

The positions remained practically the
t-ame as they traveled the iirst quarter,
except that Thrive moved up a little
i,.Â»UTer the front, while Lieutenant Gibson
had been st-r.t to the head ot the proces
fckm by Boland. When they reached the
tirgt (juarter after parsing the stand Lieu
tenant Gibson v as showing the way by
tumÂ« three lengths, with Kentucky
Farmer second and His Excellency third.
It was evident from the very fall of the
Hag that Boland, on Lieutenant Gibson,
was to make a runaway race of it. At
the half Lieutenant Gibson was going
â¢with an even, steady stride, four lengths
in front of Highland Lad. who had moved
up to fec</nd place and who was a hetid
in. front of His KxeeiUncy, three, lengths
in front of Florizax, while Kentucky
Farmer, Thrive and Hindus were strung
out for a dozen lenpths in the order
named. As they rounded the upper turn
and came into the stretch Gibson had not
relinquished more than half a length.
FfeHizar was second, a length in front of
Highland Lad. his stable companion, with
Jiis Excellency fo'jrth.-
But little char.ge was made in the final
run except that Thrive moved up to third
place, while Highland L*d and His Ex^
tellency gave evidences of distress at the
killing pace which Gibson maintained to
the lir.ish, for the twer.ty-sixih Kentucky
derby ended as it began, in a procession,'
with Lieutenant Gibson at the head and
his field trajung. Gibson passed under
the wire winner by two. lengths of day
light, without having br-en touched, in the
sensational time of 2:06V 4 . Florlzar was
second, half a length in front of Thrive,
who was a. length in front of Highland
I^ad, while His Excellency, Kentucky
Farmer and Hlnrtus were strung out in
the order narr.Â»-d.
The crowd in attendance was tremen
touf. Everywhere â on sheds, fences and
4a fact every place that humanity could
l;nd a clinging placeâ was occupied. The
betting stand was one surging, moving
Xiiass cf humanity, and the bookies were
kept busy handling the bills which men
fairly fought to get placed. When the
t-ntrles were finally posted it was found
That Orontus and Ueneuier had been
scratched, leaving seven of the best colts
la the West to contend for the honor.
Kentucky Farmer, Lieutenant Gibson,
His Excellency. Highland Lad, Florizar.
Thrive and Hindus came out on the track
in the order named and each was in turn
cheered as he paraded in front of the
eland. Starter Chinn had but lltttle
tiouble in getting them away and there
vis a murmur from the 25,iÂ«0U people pres
ent, and all eyes were fixed on the seven
colts as they came duwn to the stand.
\\ hen the bit of red bunting fell they
were all in motion and bunched closely,
Â¦with Kentucky Farmer a head the advan
tage over Lieutenant Gibson, who was
et-cond.
With sunshine overhead and a fast
track underfoot the day was auspicious
for a successful derby. The race Itself
was in some respects a disappointment.
The sensaticnal work in the trials of the
various candidates within the past v.-eck
had j^U'en rise to the belief that the raw
hide and sieol would be played vigorously
during th^ last eighth of the Journey
lii the lilg event. The promised finish
failed to materialize, for Lieutenant Gib
son was so far nigfertar to his fleld that
tht-y could not make a race of it.
TOITISVILLE. May 3.â Lieutenant
Gibson, the good son of G. W. Jonn
"i son, showed this afternoon that
| . the confidence placed in him by the
talent had bÂ«en fully justified, for
he won th<? Twenty-sixth Kentucky
<J^rby as lie plca-sed, taking three-quar

beat Motto, 3 to 5. Delia M got well down
in the finals, but her chances were killed
by the hard runs. Motto was in hard
luck. Her chances of the stake were
bright, but In the run down she was
forced to run two undecided coursea be
fore she could score against Jesse Moore.
Glenroy was in good form, but was beaten
in the fourth tie by the runner up.
Following are the day's results with
Judge P. J. Rellly's official scores:
Beer Brewer, the runner up, also show
ed In splendid form. In the run down he
beat Brian Boru after a long, tiard run.
The hares were a lively lot and gave
the hounds many long runs, and several
dogs were withdrawn from the stake on
that account.-
The winner ran in great form through
out the stake and was put to a hard test
on account of severe runs. Just previous
to the llnal, Rienzi beat Delia M after a
punishing no-go, In which the latter was
unsighted from the slips. A good test of
the winner's speed was shown in a bye
with Bad Hoy. Handicapped by hard
running, Rienzi lost after a severe course
by a score of 6 to 5. Bad Boy is consid
ered fast enough for any company.
L.ande & Gerber's Rienzi won the mid
week stake at Ingleslde Coursing Park
yesterday with Bartels Bros." Beer

ejjy* FIRE at S29 Sutter street yesterday
/l_\ afternoon nearly cost the life of
jr. â \ George II. O'Neill, who for twenty
; years has been a faithful member
of truck 4. He plunged down a light well
and injured himself so severely that at
one time his life was despaired of.
The lire was in a three-story frame
building situated near the corner of Sut
ter and Leaven worth streets, occupied as
a laundry by M, Lacaze. A defective flue
caused a blaze, and truck 4 with Its men
responded to. the alarm. It was a bad fire
to work at, and O'Neill was sent on the
roof with some; of his comrades to cut a
hole near the wall so as to allow a stream
to enter and drown out the fire just be
low. It was supposed that the fire had by
that time been driven to the basement,
and the stream to be turned in from the
roof was a precautionary measure. When
O'Neill cut through, the roof smoke and
flames leaped out through the hole and he
was almost smothered. He, was working
close to a light well, but when the smoke
poured ; out it hid everything from his
view, and he stepped back quickly to
avoid the flames that followed. All would
have been well .but for a telephone wire
that ran close to the roof and lust along
the edge of the light shaft. Over this the
unfortunate fireman tripped and in an in
stant he disappeared down the shaft. It
was two stories, to the bottom,. a fall of
nearly forty feet; sind the fireman struck
on the hard pavement that formed * the
floor of the well. ! As he . lay unconscious
it was supposed that he was dead, but he
began to recover fjuickly; and he came to
himself again at the Receiving Hospital.
His leg' Is badly; broken, his- abdomen Is
ruptured and it is still feared that he may

eâ. |j-^ HE attendance at the deg show yes
1 terday afternoon -was fully as large
U as on the opening -day and the de
cisions of the judge were generally
applauded.
Of aJl the sensations that were ever ;
sprung In a San Francisco bench show
the greatest was that sprung by Judse
Mortimer last night in the bull-terrier
class whpn the great English crack,
IJloomsbury Baron, was sent out of thÂ«
ring by the judge without notice. It em
phasizes the confidence felt by exhibitors
In the wisdom and Integrity of the Judge's
decisions that Albert Josephs, the Baron's
owner, expressed himself as satisfied
that Mr. Mortimer rendered the decision
according to his best light. In fact. It
may be safely stated that winners and
locsers alike had less complaint to make
of the way In which their pets were placed
than has ever before been experienced.
Following Is a complete list of yester
day's awards:

In a recent speech in the Senate Senator Tillman,
.in describing the motives which animated the white
\A AY has by general consent become the favorite
/ \ month in the Eastern States for holding con
* * ventions. In almost every city of importance
in that section there will be one or more of them this
year, and New York will probably have a dozen deal
ing with all sorts of issues and nfovemehts and
problems. Of the whole list, however, that which will
perhaps prove of greatest interest is to assemble at
Montgomery to discuss the relations of the whites and
the negroes in the Southern States.
This convention is to be presided over by the Hon.
Hilary A. Herbert, Secretary of the Navy during
Cleveland's second administration, and one of the
most conservative and sagacious of Southern states
men. It is to meet on the 8th and continue for three
days, and is designed to cover every salient feature of
the relations between the races.
The programme arranged for the conference is an
interesting one. President Herbert is to deal with
the subject generally in an address on "Problems
That Present Themselves." The discussions will then
be conducted under three heads: The negro in rela
tion- to franchise, the negro in relation to education
and industry, and the negro in relation to religion
and social order. The speakers will be mainly South
ern men, as only three men from the North, Dr. Fris
sell of Hampton Institute, Dr. Curry, agent of the
Peabody and Slater funds for the promotion of educa
tion in the South, and Bourkc Cockran, have been as
signed places in the more important discussions.
Among the Southern men who will make leading ad
dresses are Clifton R. Breckinridge, formerly Minister
to Russia; Walter H. Page, the novelist, and Gov
ernor McCorkle of West Virginia.
The fact that most of the speakers are to be South
ern men is significant of the awakening of the South
ern people to a consciousness of the serious nature of
the problem that confronts them. It is also an evi
dence that the better class of Southerners are not con
tent to let things drift in the direction in which they
have been so rapidly moving of late. The tendency
toward the barbarism and savagery of lynch law car
ried out with monstrous cruelty has convinced the
Southern leaders that something must be done to
I save civilization itself, and the Montgomery confer
ence is designed to formulate plans for applying a
THE SOUTHERN RflCE PROBLEM
It is a chance for geologists, a slim chance, indeed,
for any particular one of them, and a slim salary for
the successful; but still it is a chance. For men who
are masters of three languages, adepts in geology and
familiar with several other sciences, there is now open
a way by which they can obtain almost as large pay
as is given to janitors and doorkeepers at the ''na
tional capital. It is not so large as the salary that
an ordinarily promising ward boss would guarantee
one of his more active henchmen, but then menVof
scientific attainments can hardly expect to, receive
from the Government such pay as is given to ! men
serviceable to. those who run the Government. For
a man who merely understands English, French,
German, geology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy and
mathematics, a chance to get $000 a year, with a pros
pect of $1200, is perhaps sufficient; and the attractive
ness of the position is augmented by the fact that to
the salary there is to be added tlie dignity of the office
of assistant geologist of the United States Geologicil
Survey. It is worth something for a man to be able
to place after his name the awe compelling letters,
Ph. D., A. G. U. S. A. G. S.. and it is to be hoped
his learning will enable him to maintain that dignity
on a $1200 salary without straining it.
Any one who desires to compete in the examination
is notified to apply at once to the Civil Service Com
mission at Washington for application forms. Prob
ably there will be a rush for the forms, since hefe is
a chance offered by a wealthy Government for men 01
science and general learning to obtain a governmental
position without having to exert any push or pull to
get it. It is an illustration of what this republic is
willing to do in the way of promoting scientific in
vestigation, and will doubtless thrill geologic circles
with a keen excitement.
T~~) Y the United States Civil Service Commission
j \ there has been issued an announcement that
â on May 22 and 23 an examination will be held
in any city in the United States where there is a local
Board of Examiners for the position of assistant
geologist. Candidates are required to write an essay
on a geological topic, and the essay will be taken
as a test on ability in English composition. They arc
to be examined in geology, drawing, French, Ger
man, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, mathematics
and general education and experience. It is added:
"From the eligibles resulting from this examination
certification will be made to the position of assistant
-geologist in the Geological Survey at a salary of from
$900 to $1200 per annum."

A statement of the Monte Carlo gambling com
pany shows that last year the income froin the gam
bling tables was in round numbers $4,600,000, and
$150,000 more was derived from the rental of the
hotel and cafe. After, deducting all expenses and
$75,000 given to charity, the net profits amounted to
$2,3-5,000, or about 40 per cent on the capital stock.
Is it any wonder that unscrupulous persons are will
ing to do anything to obtain gambling privileges?

. Th6 State Horticultural Society might well con
cjdervthe propriety of promoting such work. At
Â¦every -meeting- of that society 'there are revelations of
interesting personal experiences with prcdaceous bugs
jind. enemies of the orchard and vineyard that creep,
crawl or fly, but these are presented in a detached
jand. -impermanent form, and therefore their use is
: impaired/. Horticulture in this State ranks fairly with
\h'e;ie.ar.ned professions, requiring equal powers and
.training of the mind- It is a fascinating pursuit and
'hasvaurnany-sided touch with high . science. It may
â¢well he .that the world is to get its best and most use
Â¦ful; literature on the subject from California. It is
sn industry inviting to the scholar, not only for its
â¢profit, but, for the sustained interest it has for the
. '. Of course this subject has already a literature, but
*ive are not aware that it exists in consecutive up-to
datUorm;.-
. '. The Englishman's idea might be very usefully ap
plied to this State. A census of the various moths,
thrips? scales, spiders, worms and bugs which attack
our orchard, vineyard and field crops, and of those
which may be used to exterminate them, would
make a. valuable addition to the library of the horti
culturist and agriculturist in California.
The citrus fruit crop of California has been saved
by 'the -introduction of these beneficial insects, and it
is believed that others may be discovered which wiil
attack other forms of insect life. It is not impossible
that the dreaded phylloxera may have an insect
enerqy which will destroy it, since the rule seems to
be that every predaceous insect has such an enemy.
The various scales, forms of insect life which prey
upon ?.nd destroy the vitality of useful trees and vines,
prove to have insect enemies which eat them and be
come the useful servants of man.
The suggestion for this work originated in the ex
perience of horticulturists in California. The clem
ency of this climate is very favorable to the growth,
precocity and fruitfulncss of trees and vines. But in
nature's plan wherever creat fruitfulness, animal or
\egetable, is located, there also are the enemies which
ct:rb it by destroying life which night monopolize all
the indigenous energies, to the exclusion of other
forms of existence. This iron law of nature works all
right until it comes in conflict with the needs of civili
zation. Then it becomes necessary to fight for the
fruittulneÂ«s of the forms of life which are required for
the use of man. So Â»e have economic entomology,
the study of beneficial insects which prey upon their
predaccous brethren that destroy what man needs.
A BUG CENSUS.
AX English fcientinc man proposes to take an in- j
sect census, classifying the insects which are
beneficial and those which arc noxious to man
and his interest^.
The petition of Ann E. Reynolds for the
removal of the tracks of the Presidio and
Ferries Railroad on Union street between
Hyde and Larkln was postponed for fur
ture'investigation. George Newhall, presi
dent of the road, said that the company
was willing to move the tracks, but the
improvements could not be undertaken
until the agitation for reduced fares had
been settled. If fares were reduced the
company- would not.be able to do the
work. Â¦
Attorney' Foulds of the Market-street
system addressed the committee and said
that the questions could not be answered
in a short space of time. Some of them
would have to be acted upon by the board
of directors. Some could not be answered
at all. and others would necessitate in*
vestigation. The company was desirous
of giving all the information possible.
Attorney Foulds said further tnat the
corporation had under consideration a
number of plans for tho solution of the
problem of concerted traffic on lower
.Market street, and they would be sub
mitted to the Board of Public Works in
a short time. The plan of a loop under
ground system and a larger turntable at
the ferries would be questions for engi
neers to determine. The proposition to
reduce fares was merely intended, Mr.
Foulds understood, to see if some means
could not be devised to prevent over
crowded cars, and the Market-street sys
tem was more anxious than anybody else
to relievo the situation. The plan of a
loop may be feasible, and that and others
would receive consideration from the di
rectors, but it could not be done hurriedly.
The Mayor asked if there was any ob
jection to answering questions as to the
original cost, gross receipts and profits of
the road, and Foulds replied that such in
formation would bo hard to ascertain and
that it was impossible to answer the
questions offhand.
Secretary Clayton of the San Francisco
and San Mateo road said that the system
operated in two counties, and while he
did not deny the right of the Supervisors
to make Inquiries regarding the road in
this county, the board has no authority
to deprive the road of its constitutional
rights.
"I do not think that this city possesses
the power," said Clayton, "to operate a
street railroad in two counties. I deem ]
that the questions are directed in the line
of investigation for public utilities. The
i facts and figures would be largely mat
tors of estimate. Because you have an
ax to grind with the Market-street road
Is no reason that our road should be
crushed out of existence by a reduction
in fares. It Is Impossible to carry a
passenger on a streetcar in this city for
less than 5 cents."
The Mayor said that a 4 cent fare would
benelit the people and build up tne sub
urbs. He admitted the earnings might
be reduced, but the company would have
less taxes to pay, which would equalize
mutters. Clayton denied that the \ city
would benetlt by a 4-cent fare. A reduced
fare, he said, means the Introduction of
factional currency and a consequent re
duction in wages.
. "The introduction of the dime in this
city. 11 Clayton, "lowered wages to
meet the new conditions, and the city
would suffer again on a penny basis."
The Mayor asked If the road' would pr<?
fer a commutation ticket to a - 2'A-cent
standing fare, and Clayton replied that
the question was somewhat the sameas
asking a man whether he would rather
be hit by an ax or a piledriver. âÂ¦:
Attorney Foulds agreed with Clayton
that a 2V4-cent standing fare would result
in people permitting many cars to pass in
order to board one that was full and so
save the 2\i cents.
B C. Sessions suggested tha,t to double
the seating capacity of the cars might
meet the requirements and stop over
crowding. . ,_,
Mr. Clayton interposed, saying double
deck cars could not be operated on the
Bteep grades in this city.
Mr. Clayton supported the contention
of Attorney Foulds that the questions
submitted could not be answered without
adequate time for investigation.
The Mayor finally suggested that the
Board of "Supervisors hear the testimony
of the railway officials in committee of
the whole. This was agreed to and the
date of the hearing was fixed for the
evening of Thursday, May 17.
The Supervisors' Street Committee met
yesterday morning for the purpose of
hearing evidence as to the financial con
dition of the local street railway com
panies. â¢ Kach company had been fur
nished with a lint of questions concerning?
the receipt", profits and cost of its system,
so as to determine if the proposed Maguire
ordinance for a 2Â»i-cent fare Is Just and
equitable.

There appears' to be no doubt .that Hill has really
regained his old position in the party. All reports of
the meeting of the State Committee agree that the
proceedings demonstrated that he is once more in the
saddle and in control of the State organization. He
proposes to concede the renomination of Bryan, but
to demand the privilege of framing, the platform. To
that endhe wishes an uninstructed delegation from
New York, to the national convention. It is to be
noted that Gorman 15 working along the same lines in
Maryland. It is one way of attaining harmony, but
the plan is subject to the objection that even ir
Bryan be got off the Chicago platform it will never
be possible to get the platform pitch off him. He
has been tarred too thick with 16 to 1 and Populism
e\*cr to be cleaned and made presentable to the coun
try.
Furthermore he is quoted as saying: "The party
should leave out of the platform all inflammatory
planks calculated to frighten away business men and
others who follow them." Then he would hive Bryan
at the first opportunity "say something by way of
tribute to Dewey and an expression of his pleasure
that the great hero had ranged himself with the forces
cf the Democratic party." That is the sum and sub
stance of his policy so far as it has been made public.
It is not a policy likely to engender enthusiasm in the
nation, but it promises a way to harmonize Democ
racy in New York State, and to candidates for local
offices that is a boon of no little value.
Any prediction of that kind would naturally be
cheering to New York Democrats. They have been
utterly hopeless for so long a time that even a prom
ise of victory upon almost impossible conditions is
like balm to their minds. In his speech Mr. Hill did
not specify either the man or the platform for the
Presidential contest, but contented himself with de
claring for a State campaign on State issues. It is re
ported, however, that at a meeting of the Democratic
State Committee he stated the party leaders should
"do a little platform making for the Democrats who
did not agree with Bryan in 1896 as well as for the
large mass of men who vote the Democratic ticket
anyhow and have nowhere else on God's earth to go."
DflV.iD B. HILL'S REAPPEARANCE.
BOSS CROKER of Tammany. being in England,
David Bennett Hill has come from his retire
ment at Wolfert's Roost and seated himself in
the saddle of New York Democracy. He has made a
speech at Syracuse which is said to~have excited a
good deal of enthusiasm. He reminded the Demo
crats that in the last State election out of a total vote
of nearly 1,250,000 Roosevelt had received less than
20,000 plurality, and from that fact he drew the con
clusion that if Democracy puts up the right man on
the right platform it can carry New York this fall.
And now even Oakland is grumbling over it3
telephone sen-ice. This ought to be proof con
clusive to the managers of themonopoly that in des
peration, even the. worm will turn.
MISSION MUST FIGHT
TO REMOVE TRACKS
THAT the Mission residents will have
a fight on their hands when the at
tempt is made to remove the South
ern Pacific tracks in that district
was demonstrated yesterday by J. E.
Foulds, attorney for the company, when
he informed the Mayor and the Supervis
ors' Street Committee that the ordinance
passed one month ago providing for the
removal of the Mission track3 would be
fought in the courts.
The ordinance directs the Board of Pub
lic Works to proceed on Monday next to
take up the tracks unless the railroad
company meanwhile tiles a written agree
ment to do the work on its own account
at some time prior to August 1, 1901.
The Mayor asked Foulds if the com
pany had decided to do anything In re
gard to the matter. an<1 the latter re
plied that he was not prepared to cay.
The Mayor suggested that the company
make some declaration of its intcntfms
to relieve the Mission of the rails at the
special meeting of the board held last
night but Foulds stated that he would

The Boaru of Education yesterday took i
up the charges against Principal E. C. l

in the school, and in having caused the '
transfer of Miss Dora Warshauer. '
Assistant City Attorney Brobeck con- ;
ducted the case for the board and Robert
Ashe appeared for Kilpatrick, who was

nesses examined were AV. S. Brann, who '
preferred ttte charges, and Thomas Smith, :
Clarence Steinbach. Elmer Kraft and
Heyman Pechner. who were pupils In the .
High School class when it was ordered
transferred. They testified that School
Director Waller had asked the pupils to
voice their choice of schools. Half of
them chose the Humboldt and the other
half the Business School. Kilpatrick had
appealed to them to remain with his
school, as he had worked hard for their
welfare.
Professor Davidson. AV. S. Herron. Miss

The Board of Supervisors met last night
to consider the lighting of public streets
and buildings by electricity. Supervisor
Reod. chairman of the Committee on Pub

offer of the independent Light and Power
Coirpany to construct a distributing elec

"This otter." raid Reed, -will make it

number of representatives of the light com
panies to be present so that they may
knew just what they have to bid on wnen
the tirrÂ«i comes."
Gas Inspector Tupper stated that there
are 4520 gas lamps used, and the rate for
next year was a cents a nisht for each .

at 4-' ! 2 cents, J101.37O, and the cost of light

for city lighting to CftJ.lOT t5.
Reed stated that the price per lamp
would be reduced, from 42 l 3 cents to less
than 27'-Â» cents. Under the system pro
posed by General Manager A. M. Hunt of
the Independent Company the public
lighting would cost J151.58S bo. Tupper saifl
that the 1501 lights which Hunt had
claimed would be sufficient to light the
city should be increased by 500, which
would bring the coat to J131.3S3 60, or $40.
000 more than Hunt's estimate. Hunt,
however, argued that 1500 lights were
enough if thty were placed In proper posi
tions. The system rould be installed in
working order in eight months.
W. H. Summerhayes of the Mutual
Company said his company owned 450
poles, but did not know whether it would
9<Â»U them to the city. Summerhayes
thought the plan of the city owning lta
own pole lines would be a losing invest
ment when the factors of Interest, taxes,
wear and tear, depredation and cost of
maintenance were taken into considera
tion.
Attorney Bishop of the San Francisco
Gas and Electric Company said that the
scheme contemplated would prove more
expensive than the Supervisors thought.
He pleaded fcr a fuller investigation and
asked that the practical men of his com
pany be allowed to give their views.
"Hunt's plan," said Bishop, "will not
light the city as he proposes. You will
find that It will take two or three times
as many lights to do the work properly.
WÂ« have a Targe Investment at stake, and
If >ou give us one month we will submit
a plan that will beat it four to one.
At the request of Reed, who said that
the Supervisors would be obliged to fix
the budget of expenditures by the first
Monday In June, the company promised
to have the plan ready on Thursday even-
Ing. May 17. when the Public Utilities
Committee will meet. Reed stated that It
is intended to appropriate the money for
the distributing system out of the next
tax levy.
Chief Electrician Hewitt Â«?aM ft would
require a fine line of poles if they were to
bo loaded wtih additional service. Hewitt
saw no practical objection to po!ea bein^
owned by the city and rented to other con
cerns, as the rentinc privileges would re
duce the cost of maintenance.
MATTERS OF INTEREST
TO CITY TAXPAYERS
. That is a coarse but frank and candid statement of
the situation. The Southern people are tired of force
and fraud. They now seek some legal method of
dealing with the negro. The nevv method falls far
short of justice and of perfect wisdom, but it is bet
ter than the old. It is a step in the right direction,
and the Montgomery conference. may have a potent
influence in rousing the South to put an end to lynch
law and secure the negro in his property and per
son, even if denying him the. political privileges to
which his citizenship entitles him.
people of South Carolina in adopting a constitution
which virtually disfranchises the negroes, said: "We
took the government away. We stuffed ballot-boxes.
We shot them. We are not ashamed of it. The Sen
ator from Wisconsin would have done the same
thing. I see it in his eye right now. He would have
done it. With that systemâ force, tissue ballots, etc. â
we got tired so we called a constitutional
convention and we eliminated all of the colored people
whom we could under the fourteenth and fifteenth
amendments."

THE CHRONICLE'S ANSWER.
Projecting the line of precedents into the current
controversy, there is but one conclusion possible.
The treaty of Paris did not incorporate the Philip
pines into the Union of the United States, and did not
declare the people of those islands to be citizens.
Therefore the territory is outside the Union, not un
der the constitution, and the inhabitants are not citi
zens, and are entitled only to such constitutional
privileges as Congress chooses to extend to them.
We held California under military government by
the executive four years before Congress saw fit to
make the constitution wholly operative here. But
during all of that time the treaty of Guadaloupe Hi
dalgo was in force'here. and whatever rights of citi
zenship it extended to the Mexican-born inhabitants
were theirs by treaty, not by the constitution.
The Chronicle shifts and varies. At one time it
seems to- agree with Webster, and "another time it
lines up with Bryan. It made the above answer on
its Bryan day.
If a mere act of annexation make citizens of all over
whom it extends the jurisdiction of the United States,
will the Chronicle tell us why Jefferson and Monroe
found it necessary, in the annexation of Louisiana and
Florida, to expressly stipulate in the treaties that the
people of those Territories were incorporated in the
Union of the United States? In fact, in the case of
every preceding annexation the question of incorpora
tion in our body politic has been settled by treaty.
A treaty- becomes the supreme law of the land. As the
treatj' of Paris does not so incorporate Porto Rico
and the Philippines, and is purposely silent on the
civil status of their people, we deny that the Federal
constitution either admits or excludes any class of the
inhabitants of those islands. When we acquired Cali
fornia the treaty settled the question of citizenship.
But no one pretended that the constitution was opera
tive here until the enabling act of Congress extended
it to this territory- In his December message of 184S
President Polk recommended the extension 6i our
revenue laws to California, just as President McKin
ley recommended in the case of Porto Rico, but Con
gress differed with Polk, as it did with McKinley, and
those laws were not extended. We search the records
in vain for any strident denunciation of Polk for
recommending it, or of his party in Congress for re
fusing it. Finally the revenue laws alone were ex
tended to California, but by the will of Congress, and
without pretense that those laws were made operative
here, automatically, by the constitution.
But this is an evasion. The whole controversy is,
did annexation extend the whole constitution, with
its immunities, privileges, limitations, grants and
checks, to these islands and islanders? Or must this
be done, as Webster contended, by authority of act
of Congress?
"All of which, we respectfully submit, are answered
in article XIV of the Federal constitution, which
sÂ«ys:. 'All persons born in the United States and sub
ject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the
United States and of the State wherein they reside'
This provision of the constitution, in the judgment of
good lawyers who derive their opinion from a read
ing of the decisions of the Supreme Court, would
have made a classification in the treaty of the persons
admitted to citizenship by the extension of our sov
ereignty over the islands a work of supererogation.
As for the two questions pertaining to the class ex
cluded from citizenship, the fourteenth amendment,
section 2, furnishes the answer: 'Representatives
shall be apportioned among the several States accord
ing to their respective numbers, counting the whole
number of persons in each State, excluding Indians
not taxed.' Under this provision untaxed Indians in
the States as well as the Territories have always been
regarded as wards of the nation rather than citizens,
and have been governed accordingly. We presume
the same course will be followed in the Philippines."
1 7 E recently asked the Chronicle what class of
\\f inhabitants in the Philippines were made citi
ztns by annexation, and what class are ex
cluded? What language in the treaty of Paris classi
fies the annexed people? How are we to govern the
excluded class 2 To this the Chronicle r.eplies:

XIU.â PORTRAITURE AT HOME.
(Concluded.)
In dealing with the portrait of a lady
we must consider another and most im
portant pointâ gracefulness. This is at
tained by combining with the pyramid a
double-curved line, well named the "line
of beauty." In figure 13 we have an ex
ample of portraiture in which the figure
is composed on the lines of a pyramid;
therefore the position is "stable," but
any one can see that it is not graceful.
If we run a Jlne from the forehead
through the middle of the composition we
will find it will be perfectly straight. Lit
tle wonder that the pose is stiff. L*t us
redraw the figure, keeping practically the
same boundary lines, but arrange the
pose so that the medial line will be a
double curve, and at once we get the
grace that was lacking.
Did space permit I would go into this
question more fully, but I have said
enough to give a starting point and will
content myself with offering a few hints
on posing that deserve consideration. We
do not as a ruie wish to see gracefulness
in a man. therefore the double curve
should not be used In male portraiture.
Again, leaning a head away from the
lens suggests meekness; toward it. vivac
ity and go. Now you can understand why
soma men's portraits make them look so
submissive. As a matter of fact, expres
sion is largely dependent on the relative
positions of body, head and eyes to each
other and to the lens. The most intelli
gent and alive expression is got by plac
ing the sitter's chair at right angles to
the lens, then turning the body a little
toward the camera, the head still more,
and the eyes looking right into the lens.
See figure 11. The most stupid expression
is got by having body, head and eyes
square on the lens. I need not illustrate
this, as it is the poso that Is perpetrated
by every beginner.
But I must hasten on to the problem of
lighting 1 , which Is even more Important
than that of posing and more difficult to
learn thoroughly. In this matter I in
tend to follow the practice of all the
great painters, believing that what was
good enough for them is good enough for
me. In calling your attention to figure
âthe two latter aro not so noticeable hers
on account of the beard. The reader
should now bÂ« able to see for himself how
these high lights are connected with the
shadows by means of half-tones.
Now for the practical application of all
this theorizing'. Select a window having
a clear view of the skyâ that is, no over
hanging: porch or trees In front of Itâ and
cover the lower half with some opaque
fabric, such as a sofa blanket pinned to
the middle bar. This is because we
learned that the light came from the top.

HOLMES FINALLY
ADMITS SHORTAGE
WHEN (he members of the Board
of Harbor Commissioners read
yesterday morning In The Call
tho full story of the irregularities
connected with the construction of How
ard-stroet wharf No. 3 and the charges
made against their chief engineer, How
ard C Holmes, in'eonnectiori'with those
Irregularities, they were amazed. The
Commissioners had been somewhat en
lightened the day before through the in
vestigation set on foot of the scandalous
state of affairs, but Mr. Holmes had for
the time being allayed their â¢ apprehen
sions by positive declarations that mut
ters were not as bad as stated.
The first act of the Commissioners after
reading the disclosures in The Call was
to order that no more cylinders be put
down until lnvestiRations are made by the
Commissioners. This settles the putting
In of- any more short ones.
The board was in no wise prepared for
the direct charges made by Assistant En
gineer Ryan against Holmes and the evi
dence regarding the great shortage of tho
cylinders and the knotty lumber that was
going into them.
Most of yesterday Holmes was busy
trying to explain matters to the Commis
sioners. They did not accept his state
ments as settling the points, however, as
they had done the day before, and decided
that the matter must be thoroughly in
vestigated. This investigation may be
held at the next regular meeting of the
board, which takes place next Wednesday
afternoon.
President Kilburn says the chief engi
neer should have kept the board informed
of any shortage In the cylinders; that it
was his duty to do so and that Holmes
knew it to bo his duty.
Holmes, as was predicted, tried to clear
himself of the charge of collusion with
the contractors by saying that he intend
ed to present to the board when the work
was completed a report of the total short
age of cylinders so the State could get the
benefit of the decreased cost. The chief
engineer is very contradictory in his
statements. In the presence of President
Kilburn he stated positively Tuesday af
ternoon that he knew all about the cylin
ders going into the work; that only a few
of them were short, perhaps three or
four and these were only four feet less
In length than called for by the specifica
tions. Yesterday Holmes said he had left
the matter of keeping track of the cylin
ders entirely to Inspector Hugh Duff, and
that he was to get a report from him
when the work was completed. Duff
makes the statement that Holmes knew
Commission Promptly Stops the
â¢Construction of Short
Cylinders.
all along what length the cylinders were.
It has been learned from an outside
source that after the adjournment of the
board Wednesday the Commissioners
gathered informally to talk over the ru
mors of pcandal that had been going
around during the day. They sent for
Holmes and asked him how many cylin
ders were short. He acknowledged to
thirty, then cot up to forty. The average
shortage was three feet, he said. Â¦ Even
the Commissioners gasped at this and
asked why the board had not been Jn
rormed. Mr. Holmes gave the reason al
ready stated.
Duff was then sent for. He said he
col > ld tell how many cylinders were short
and how much so. He was told to tile a
written report yesterday.
Holmes still declares "that the specifica
tions properly construed, call for second
class lumber, and reiterates his statement

formed of what was going on. Bevond
this they had little to say, except that thfe
matter would be investigated. Commis
sioner Herold said there was, plenty of
money yet due the contracting firm 'to
save the State from loss.
Holmes cleared himself of one charee
yesterday by producing the copy of a let
ter sent out November 27 to the contract
ors Informing them that owing to the
scarcity of long planks the longer staves
could consist of two lengths, which would
make the splicing legitimate. Holmes did
not produce this letter Tuesday. The con
tractors acknowledge having received this
letter.
The best proof that it was understood
by all firms but the successful one that
ship's planks should be used in construct
ing the cylinders lies in the bids made by
makers of the cylinders for supplying
them to contractors who contemplated
trying for the Job. The Pacific Tank
Company submitted estimates to at least
two of, the unsuccessful "bidders. This
company made bids based on the use of
ship planks, worth from 122 50 to J30 a
thousand, according, to length. These
prices were furnished this company at its
request by the Pacific Pine Lumber Com
pany. Second-class lumber Is worth from
$13 65 to $14 65 a thousand in the same
lengths. 1
Tho Commissioners paid a visit to the
wharf yesterday morning, in company
with Engineer Holmes. Some soundings
were taken for future use.
The Thomson Bridge Company was one
of the lowest of the unsuccessful bidders
Thomas Thomson of that firm says it
might have secured the contract had it
known second-class lumber would be ac
ceptable. This firm received Its estimate
on the cylinders from a Berkeley firm
which "figured on first-class ship planks'
as it understood the specifications called
for. Mr. Thomson, like the other con
tractors, says he was never notified that
second-class lumber could be used.
Inspector Duff filed a report with the
board yesterday showing a total short
ago in the 108 cylinders driven of 477. feet
These cylinders are now under water and
It will be hard to verify these figures.
The. cylinders lying on the dock are ten
feet short. The sixty and sixty-five, foot
ones are still to be made, but yesterday's
order of the board will prevent them be
ing constructed under the specified
length.
SHAG ROCK IS
STILL A MENACE
TO NAVIGATION
Torpedoes May Be Used to
Clear Away Broken
Fragments.
Debris Caused by the Explosion Set
tled Back Into the Old Location
and Must Be Removed
by Contractors.
The problem of petting the necessary
depth of water on tho spot where Snap
Rook stood Is ptlll confronting the con
tractors. After the explosion the Gov
ernment purveyors found only 14 feet of
water at low tide, whereas there should
have been 30 feet. Nearly all the rock
that was blown into tbe air fell back Into
the hole asraln and this has now to be
removed. The contractors think that the
ebb and flow of the tide will help them
a great deal in removing: the debris, and
that with the assistance of a dredper and
divers the pntire surface of the rock can
be cleared to the required depth without
much expense. If divers and dredgers
cannot do the work then torpedoes will
be used. They will break the loose rock
into powder and then there will be no
difficulty in clearing oft the debris.
When Blossom Rock was blown up Con
tractor von Schmidt was confronted with
the same difficulty that the Shag Rock
people are now having. The obstruction
was shattered, but the fragments all fell
back into the spot from which they had
been ejected and it cost Von Schmidt $25.
000 to remove them. The contractors for
the. removal of Shag Rock assert that
the whole base of the obstruction has
been shattered to a depth of 40 feet and
that whÂ»Â»n they are through with the. Job
soundings will show that much water.
Blossom Rock was never cleared to the
contract depth and to-day there is only
22 feet of water on it at low tide. This
will not be the case with Shag Rock,
however, as the contractors fully expect
to have 40 feet at low water with the as
sistance of dredgers, divers and torpe
doep.

by the nose, so we* can argue that the
source of light must' have been well for
wardâin fact, very close to the lens.
But let us take a shadow lying in an
other direction and see what it tells us.
We find, one under the right eyebrow;
therefore the source of light is above.
But if it were right overhead the eyebrow
would cast a shadow completely over the
eye: but it does not, and as the band of
shadow is very narrow the light must
come from a point well forwardâ in fact,
very close to the lens. This is further
proved by the length of the shadow cast
by the nose on the upper lip, which it
will be noticed is just a little below the
nostril. -
Having located the position of the
source of light we may with advantage
give a few minutes' consideration to the
high lights and half-tones. The highest
lights will be found on the left temple,
the ridge of the nose, upper Up and chin

ered me for ten years, and now I can tell
all I know of the subject In a sentence.
For children and young people let them
be light; for middle-aged peoplo use mid
dle-tinted grounds, and for old people
let them be dark. Have them plain. I
use a sheet or a blanket, or focusing or
anything that comes handy, but I will

shadows I described. If the nose* casts
one too broad on the cheek turn the face
a trifle nearer the window; if too narrow,
then a little farther away. Now look at
the eyes. Do you see the beautiful spark
ling catch lights â if so. where are they?
The proper position is just on the edge of
the eyelids; if they are lower the head is
tilted too high or the sitter is too far from
the light. â¢ If not visible the head is too
low or the sitter too near the light. Last
of all look at the shadow cast by the
nose on the lip. It should not reach below
the middle. If cut off square with the
noÂ«tril there Is too much bottom light so
raise the curtain a little higher on the
window; or it may be the head Is flung
back, in which case lower It. Last of all
examine the bridge of the nose, for here
is the proof of your problem. The bridsn
is a mass of half-tone, and this should
blend beautifully Into the shadow beyond.
If it show with a sharp line against th*
shadow the position of the sitter la net
correct and a movement of a few Inches
is necessary. I am sorry I cannot tell
you exactly in what direction, so von
must find out by trial. It Is in this last
little point that the hand of the master
is shown, and it takes a long time to be

readily. Get a posÂ« as close to the ex
ample as possible, and then seat yourself
in front of the camera so that your eye
will be in front of the lens. (If there be
anything I detest it is to see a man pop
ping his head under the focusing cloth
all the time, for it clearly shows he does
not know what he wants. A camera is
only a tool, and not until the pos* an.l
Ilshtirg are arranced should the ground
gla?s be looked at.) Now look for the
15 I need hardly remind my readers that
the character of the paper on which it is
printed prevents the use of anything but
line drawings, which. It must be con
fessed, do not permit the rendering of the
niceties of light and shade in the orig
inal, and therefore It is more than likely
that the reader will be unable to see in
the illustration some of the points I de
scribe. But if he proceeds to put the
teaching into practice he will have no
difficulty in tindini them on the sitters
face. The portraits by the way. is that
of James Inglis, who Is. I believe, the
greatest master of photographic Hshtins:
to-day, and to whom I am Indebted for
all I know on the subject.
On looking at the face we find it con
tains lights and shadows, and as we ex
amine it more closely we find that these
lights and shadows do not exist as flat
masses, but that the one blends into the
other, so that we have e\-ery gradation
from pure white to deep black. There is
no difficulty in locating the high lights
and deep shadows, but it takes an edu
cated eye to note the subtleness of the
gradations, commonly called half-tones.
From the one extreme to the other. And
even after they can be detected in the
finished print it is still difficult to appre
ciate them on the face, tor here they are
complicated with the locxl color.
Suppose we make a start with the
shadows. One is very evidentâ that on
the sitter's right cheek, and now we can
see another to the right of the nose and
under the eyebrow. But a shadow tells
the direction of the source of light, for
we know light travels always in a
straight line; so if the shadow is on the
sitter's right then the source of light must
be on his left. But if it were decidedly
on the left, the nose would throw a
shadow right across the cheek, which it
does not do. As a matter of fact, we see
but a very narrow band of shadow cast

NEW TORK. May Sâ The general public con- '
tinues to hold aloof from any share in business
en the Stock Exchange, and the movement of
prices reflects unly the operations of the small j
room traders. These professional operators, for :
the most part, clnptd up their contracts before j
the day hid expired, thus rectifying, to a large \
extent, the price movement which has resulted I
from the original contract. Other operators t
of this class are in the habit of carrying their j
contracts over one day. The result of these ,
operation?; which are kr.cwn in Stock Exhange j
jarlar.'.w as "trading Jackknives." Is a eee
*aw market, prices moving one way on one I
Cay and the contrary on the next day, as the i
sales cr purchases cf the one day are affected j
by the contrary operation* on the next.
Slight gains are the rule to-day princi
pally because losses were the rule yes- j
tfrday. Stocks wlilch from special causes j
fhowei strength yrs'.erday Â¦bowed weakness j
to-day. Sugar punnefl slightly below yesterday's
level, ar.d was the leader of tne market. The j
eteel stocks were inclined to harden alter yes- j
terday'n eharp break, the tendency being assist
ed by imports of the oper.ing of eonr.e of the j
*teel in!l;s. The coalers were raided by the bears j
on the resolution cf the anthracite operators 1
to support the new coal road. The statements |
ol weekly eaxniegs by St. Paul and Hocking 1
Valley and the eettlemer.t of the Xcw York ;
Central's threatened trouble with laborers en- j
couraged the traders to take the bull Bide.
The faiiure cf the predicted action on the ;
Â£iv:de:i4 of the Missouri Paciac caused a sharp j
treak from the early break in that stock. The ]
local tractions recovered from yesterday's
weakness. The extreme movements in either
direction were net maintained and the closing
Â»aÂ». dull and Irregular at small net clearings
after the market had sunk near to stagnation
iranv times during the session. ;
The money market continued very easy, al- !
though the proepect is for a weak bank return
on Saturday.

TO SAIL.
CHICAGO, May 3.â The corn market began
the session weak because of lower cables, freer
country offerings and a slack demand. Liver
pool closed %@Uid lower, furnishing the main
influence. July opened H8*Â»c down at
40 s iCf409ic and after touching 39T4c, while no
body was looking, proceeded to break with great
rapidity. The slump was due to heavy general
liquidation led by two of the leaders In the
recent bull movement. The decline was checked
at 39-Tic, there being a fair demand after the
concession of a cent and a little rally fol
lowed, but the close was weak, July lc under
yesterday at 40c.
Wheat was dull and easy. Corn was the
dominant influence, while easy cables and the
favorable weather were contributory factors.
The speculative trade was light, but a fair
cash business â 260.C0O bushels â was accom
plished. New York reported thirty-two loads
taken for export. July opened ',ic under at
67><<867 3 Â»c, and on a little buying ascended to
67*i'Â«67Vic The wings of the market were
heavy with the corn weakness, and failed to
hold even that small elevation, and the mar
ket reacted to 667<gC. The close was easy.
July He lower at 67<g67V4c. The July-May spread
narrowed to lHc, elevator people taking the
May at that difference.
The oats market was unexpectedly firm In
view of the corn weakness. The market was
j sustained by a good shipping business. July
: closed HSVic down.
Provisions opened steady, but suffered a
rharp break in sympathy with corn and on
pome liquidation, but recovered It on buying'
by packers and closed steady. July pork
closed 74c down; July lard 2V2C higher.
The leading futures ranged as follows:
San Francisco and vicinityâ Cloudy, unset
tled weather Friday, with conditions favorable
for light showers; light southerly winds, chang
ing to westerly.

Charters.
Money was tight on the call for 10 per cent
of the war loan, although this had been pre
pared for. Call money was ; higher early, but
closed at 4 per cent. The bank did a moderate
business In discounts and received the bulk of
considerable loans due. No gold is expected
from America,
The 6llver market apparently miscalculated
the Americans' position. New York Is now
holding for 27%. while forced sales were ex
pected.
M| CLOSING.
LONDON* May 8.â Union Pacific preferred.
Anacondas were heavy, being adjusted to par
ity, which now regulates the prices. Paris
supported Tlntos. i
j Americans opened depressed, went under
parities, but rallied above them on a dispatch
I announcing that the New' York Central strike
was eettled. It Is hoped that this will be a
forerunner of similar settlements elsewhere.
Prices weakened on complete absence of con
firmation of the first report. New York sup
ported slightly, but In the street prices were
reactionary and featureless. .
The markets here began dull to-day, then
hardened slightly on a canard that Lord Rob
erts had captured Â£000 Boers and sixteen guns.
The market relapsed on publication of the tame
actual dispatch and the close was irregular.
Investment securities . were <weak on the dis
appointing t-iuik returns.

James W. Lick, nephew of the Jate
James Lick, the millionaire philanthro

in the hallway of the old Pioneer Hall
building at 8)8 Montgomery street. He
had been up only a few minutes and was
about to go for his breakfast when death
overtook him. He was a native of Penn
sylvania. 72 years old, and was a mem
ber of the Society of California Pioneers
As he had been subject to epileptic fits It
Is believed that his death was caused by
one of them.
At one time very many years a^ro Mr.
Lick was well supplied wltb the world's
groods, but injudicious Investments re
duced him to a condition of poverty and
he accepted from the Pioneers a situation
as Janitor of the old building endeared to
him by many historic associations.

attention at the Chutes in San Francisco
several months ago, had an exciting ex

vicious little lioness, escaped from the
cage and put the employes of the Coeur

Adgie had completed her engagement
here and was arranging to have the lions
transported to the depot. She and her
manager quarreled over who should enter
the cage, which was on the stage, and
one of them opened the door. In a sec
ond the lioness sprang out Into the crowd.
There was a mad flight of a score of sight
seers.
After an hour's work Adgie managed to
drive the lioness back into the cage, but
it was not until then any other persons
could be induced to enter the theater.

Loses to Oscar Gardner in the Fifth
Round When He Thought He
Was Winning.
LOUISVILLE, Ky., May 3.â Eddie San
try of Chicago was knocked out by Oscar
Gardner before the Nonpareil Athletic
Club to-night in the presence of a crowd
that packed Music Hall. Sporting men
from all parts of the country who are here
in attendance at the races saw the bout.
George Siier cf Chicago refereed the light.
The fight was a fast one, and while tht>
honors were not materially in Santry's fa
vor he had somewhat the better of tht.
argument up to the time Gardner landed
the kno<?k-out blow. His superior reach
and height enabled him to use both right
and left with effect on the Omaha Kid's
face and body, and he would have kept
out of harm's way but for Gardner's
rushes, which he began early in the game.
Santry landed " frequently with both
right and left, and Gardner's face gave
evidence of the Chicago man's Jabs. In
the fifth round Gardner, took on additional
steam and from the tap of the gong he
kept at Santry. using both hands on the
latter's body. When the round was about
half over they came together and Gard
ner's right shot with full force Into San
try's stomach. The hands of the latter
went up and he fell over In a heap on the
floor. He was carried to his corner, and
it was several minutes before he had re
vived sufficiently to be taken from the
ring. Santry was unscratched. He said
it was a chance knock-out and that it was
landed when he felt that he had the fight
in hand.

Supreme Court Justices Eind Flaws
in the Rulings of the Lower
Tribunal.
Yda Addis Storke of Santa Barbara is
to have another trial. She was convicted
and sentenced to one year in the County
Jail for having written and sent letters
In which prominent citizens of that local
ity were grossly libeled. One in particu
lar contained a statement that the rela
tions of a Dr. Martha Case and Dr. Win
chester were Improper. Mrs. Storke's
conviction was upon circumstantial evi
dence, much of which was furnished by
Handwriting Expert Theodore Kytka. At
the trial the accused stated that the ob
jectionable letters were written by F. N.
Gutierrez. Samples of this man'B writing
were submitted to the expert, who stated
that they in no way resembled the writ
ing in the offensive letters. Upon this the
District Attorney had the Gutierrez writ-
Ings ruled out. The Supreme Court de
cided that this was an error, as the jury
men had a right to view the letters and
Judge for themselves. In passing upon
this point the Supreme Court gave the
writing expert a sly dig by saying:
"We think the court erred in striking
out the evidence in question. In a case in
volving a comparison of different writings
the ordinary individual can frequently ar
rive at a conclusion quite as correct as
that of the opinion of the most skilled ex
pert in handwriting, particularly where,
as in this case, this expert testified that
there was no resemblance or similarity."
YDA ADDIS STORKE IS
GRANTED A NEW TRIAL
DEATH, dire ruin and. Incidentally,
a pack of canines visited Ham
mond's rabbitry at 1510 Shotwell
street some time between midnight
and the hour of sunrise Wednesday morn-
As the interest In the game was wan-
Ing and the last Belgian hare squealed
and gave up the ghost, the owner of the
pet "fads" put in an appearance. He
beat one canine to death, but the other
escaped "his wrath. When he raked up
tho seventy carcasses Into a heap he de
clared with emphasis that there should
be no more coursing matches In his rab
bit ry.
"These are new ones on us," they said
with a wag of the tail, "but If they are
limber and have any 'speed' there should
be average sport."
For a long time the dogs, having had
an acquaintance at the coursing park,
watted in vain for Judge Grace anp hla
son, the slipper, but neither appeared.
They then assumed official responsibility
and opened cage after cage with their
paws, until seventy doors stood open.
The chase began around the rabbltry.
"Turns," "wrenches." "no-goes" and
"kills" were scored, but "escapes" were
impossible.
Ing. Cfape Is visible on the latches of
seventy barred doors and the funerals of
seventy scions of the Belgian hare nobil
ity are to take place to-morrow. One
dog of the bull pup variety, with an appe
tite for delicious rabbit and the scent of
a hound, fell on the scene of death and
desolation with the fuzzy hair of twenty
five victims on his collar and blood on hla
teeth, but his remains were disposed of
In ignominy, except for the condolence
of the coursing fraternity, the "purp"
having acted nobly under the Influence of
natural propensities for the sport and
died defending all that is dear to the
leashman's heart.
The story goes that a band of dogs have
watched the hares for some time. They
recognized their distinction from the low
born, high-eared jack rabbits that frolic
among the sagebrush stalks on Sam
Davis" Holsteln ranch.

The Olympia has some special features
this week that are not only drawing large
houses, but pleasing them.
The bill at the Orpheum this week is
one of the best in many months and as a

Butler has thoroughly proved that she
was deserving of her New York success.
The attractions for next week include:
MIKon and Dollie Nobles; Mark Sullivan.
a mimic and monologist: W. E. Bates,
cornet soloist, and the biograph with a
series of interesting pictures taken re
cently In South Africa.
Ward and Vokes will continue to present
their farce. "The Floor Walkers," at the
Columbia Theater up to and including
Sunday night. The stars and their com
pany have been well received in the amus

Yale's ppectacle, "The Evil Eye." wkh
its many trick mechanical effects, elec
tric ballet, the Phasey troupe of English
girls, Al H. Wilson, the German comedian,
and many other features, will begin a
limited engagement. Over fifty people
take part in the production.
"Sue," the old-time favorite, adapted
from Bret Harte's "The Judgment of
Uolfnas Plain," is crowding the Alcazar
anr? giving the audience a great deal of
pleasure.
The attractiveness of the comic opera,
"The Wizard of the Nile," is popularizing
(he Tivoll and the business is larger than
v/as enjoyed by "The Idol's Eye." The
performance goes with a merry swing
and precision and every member of the
company, principals, chorus and or
chestra, helps in the complete success of
the production. There is no doubt
that "The Wizard of the Nile" will dupli
cate tht- run of "The Idol's Eye." Next
Monday evening will be J'ne twenty-fifth
performance at the Tivoll of "The Wiz
ard" and the occasion will be a gala one.
All the officers and crew of the French
cruiser Protet, now in port, will attend
the Tivoli next. Monday as the guests of
George P. Hall, the Turkish Consul, and
special numbers will be introduced into
"The Wizard of the Nile" for the benefit
of the French naval officers and men.
The French colony proposes to make the
occasion a memorable ore for their com
patriots and there is a big demand for
s?ats.
"In Gay New York" is filling the Grand
Opera-house. It has introduced to the
public several comic songs that are sure
to have a long lease of popular favor.
Among them may be mentioned "The rid
disherCoon, '^ungljy Harry Cashman. and
the duet by him and Blanche Chapman,
"You're All Right, But Your Money's No
Good." Chris Bruno and beautiful Mabel
Russell have again captured the town
with a now and dainty cakewalk and the
charmjng vocalization of I5abelle Under
wood and George C . Lysing is among
the chief attractions of the entertain
ment.
Fischer's Concert House Is meeting with
deserved success. The pretty place of
melody is crowded nightly, by reason of
the fact that Mr. Fischer provides an en
tertainment that would call for swell
prices elsewhere. There is a good bill this
week. It includes John Kurkamp, who
possesses a tenor voice of pure quality
and sympathetic tone, which is well dis
played !n several catchy ballads. Mme.
Walters, who has a clear, far-reaching
and sweet soprano voice, is a new star In
tho constellation, that is thoroughly ap
preciated. Fignorina Pollettin! and Slgnor
Vargas are decidedly entertaining in their
duet. Those who fail to wait and see the
last act of â¢â¢Traviata," which Is presented
by the members of the Italian opera com
pany, will miss a genuine treat, for their
handling of the work is worthy of high
commendation. The orchestra is excel
lent, and we look for still better results
from its efforts. This house, which is a
promoter of good music, is worthy of sub
stantial support from thi* music-loving
community of San Francisco.

The next issue of the Pacific Christian
will contain a copy of the resolutions
adopted by the State board in accepting
Rev. Mr. Smith's resignation. They are al
ready in the hands of Rev. W. B. Berry,
editor of the denominational organ, who is
officially instructed to give them publicity.
Rev. Guy Smith has found one body that
will not whitewash his acts, ana that is
the State Board of the Christian church.
Last Monday the board practically indorsed
all that has been said against him and
supported charges that have been made.
Resolutions were adopted accepting his
resignation as financial secretary of the
board, and also setting forth that, while
it had not been shown that he had been
guilty of any specific act of immorality,
he had, in the opinion of the board, com
mitted acts of indiscretion that warranted
the board in accepting his resignation.
Probably this was not what Rev. Guy
Smith anticipated when he offered his res
ignation, but no less would satisfy the
conscientious members of that body.
The State board was called together to
hear and review all the testimony that
had been taken in Oakland in connection
with the scandal attending the First
Christian Church pastorate of Smith. It
was all put in, and as the reading pro
ceeded Smith could sec how the members
of the board were affected by it. There
was no room lor doubt that they would
accept the resignation.
The board had no power to compel a
resignation, and in accepting one did all
that could be done. The explanation of
this is that all officers of the board are
elected at the annual convention of the
Christian churches of the State, and the
convention alone has power to remove.
During the proceedings before the State
board there was one significant happen
ing. Rev. Mr. Smith said that if Mr. Lloyd
of the Oakland church had been present
there would have been more favorable ac
tion In his case. Burrill White, the attor
ney, who appeared for the prosecution in
the proceedings in Oakland, was present,
and asked whether Mr. Lloyd had taken
the trouble to inform himself of the facts.
This was a poser, to which Smith was
compelled to answer in the negative.
Therefore it appeared, according to his
statement, that he had Lloyd's promise to
stand by him without making an,investi
gation.
His Resignation Accepted and Reso
lutions Adopted Setting Forth
â¢ That Such Action Was Jus
tified by His Deeds.
Representatives of All the
Christian Churches
Rebuke Him.
REV. GUY SMITH
IS TURNED DOWN
BY STATE BOARD
Mr. Keed's action clears the political
atmosphere In the Republican party of
Alameda County so far as the present is
concerned. As he has expressly stated,
Mr. Reed's withdrawal is due to the de
sire of Congressman Victor H. Metcalf.
All of those interested in the establish
ment of a harmonious representation at
the national convention from California
are satisfied with the conditions which
now prevail on that line. The result of
the arrangements which were made at
last night's conference means that Dr.
George C. Pardee will have no opposition
from the Third Congressional District as
a candidate before the State convention
for delegate-at-large. Mr. Reed, if he de
sires the honor, will be the Third District
delegate to the national convention. The
absence of a contest will make the pri
mary called for May 10 a merely perfunc
tory matter.
It is asserted by those who were Inter
ested in arranging the compromise that
the action has no bearing upon the Con
gressional situation.
The foregoing personal announcement
of George W. Heed's withdrawal from the
field as a candidate for delegate-at-large
to the National Republican Convention
was sent out to-day. This results from
the harmonizing conference which was
held last evening, when the decision was
reached by which the threatened contest
for honor has been averted.
Oakland, May 3, 1900.
Editor Call: Through the columns
of your valuable paper allow me to
say to my friends and to the public
that I hereby withdraw my candi
dacy as delegate-at-large from the
State of California to the National
Kepublican Convention. I do so in
deference to the wishes of our Rep
resentative to Congress, the Son.
Victor H. Metcalf, who is a warm
personal friend of mine. Aside from
this reason I will add that I have at
heart the success of the Republican
party, and I feel that the withdrawal
of my candidacy at this time will
prevent a contest which possibly
might bs detrimental to the best in
terests of the party in the coming
campaign. GEO. "W. HEED.

Prom Under Noses of Three
Watchmen and Leave No
The gang of sneak thieves that Infests
the water front made a haul on Mission
street wharf last Wednesday. In spite of
the fact that there are three electric
lights v and three watchmen on the wharf
a case of cigars valued at $350 was re
moved and not a trace. of the thieves can
be found. .When ttte" Albion sailed for
Nome two cases of cigars and some other
merchandise was left behind. The* wharf
rats evidently came along in a skiff and
climbing upon the wharf made away with
one case under the watchmen's noses.
Their boat was evidently a small one or
they would j have taken the second case
also. Sergeant Tom Ellis of the "harbor

may end in landing the entire gang in

Bound for the Orient.
The Mail Company's steamer Rio de
Janeiro sailed, for Hongkong yesterday
via Honolulu and Yokohama. She carried
a very small passenger list. Among those
in the cabin was Commander F. M. Wise,
who goes to the Asiatic station to taka
command of one of the gunboats. Quito
a number of ChinesÂ© and Japanese sailed
on the vessel. Among them were fifty
three natives of the Flowery Kingdom
and two from the land of the chrysanthe
mum, who were deported at the last min
ute. These fifty-five Mongolians have been
held in the pen over the entrance to the
Mail dock for over a month, awaiting
habeas corpus proceedings, but the Collec

minded him the Asiatics were in the coun

back.
Mrs. Peterson Passes Away.
Mrs. B. Peterson, relict of the late Harry
Peterson and mother of Henry Peterson,
the well known oarsman, died at her
home, 1164 Center street, Oakland, last
Wednesday morning. Her death will be
mourned by a large circle of friends.
Mrs. Peterson camo here, in 1859 via
Panama on the steamer Golden Gate, and
her home has ever since been in Califor
nia. She was taken sick last Sunday, but
no thought of a fatal termination to her
illness was entertained. A sudden attack
of rheumatism went to the heart and all
was over in an instant. She leaves three
sons and three daughters to mourn her
loss. Henry, is known throughout all ship
ping circleaxin San Francisco and among
rowing men the world over. Charles is on
the police force and Edward is in business

across the bay on the 2:30 p. m. boat to
day and the interment will take place in

Accidents. on the Front.
L. Flnninan, a fireman on the revenue
cutter Manning, is puzzling the doctors at
the Harbor Hospital. He was found on
Howard-street wharf in a dazed condi
tion and taken to the hospital in the am
bulance. His power of speech was gone.
When Dr. Walter Thome came on watch
he made a thorough examination of the
patient and found that his entire right
side was .gradually becoming paralyzed.
The man's head was carefully looked over
for a wound and his body was examined.
The only scratch that could be found 'was
on the right shin, from which the skin
had been scraped in several places.
When Dr. Dorr came in he and Dr.
Thome held a consultation on the case
and everything possible was done for the
unfortunate fellow. The chances are
against his recovery, however. Finninan
was paid off from the revenue cutter last
week and started in to have a good time.
He was to have been aboard again yester
day and the chances are that he wandered
down to the front during the night,
tripped over some obstruction on the
wharf and in falling injured his skull.
Thomas J. Foley of 1S13 Powell street
will not drink oyster cocktails on the
front again in a hurry. Yesterday he
swallowed a piece of the shell along with
the oyster and had to have it removed
by Dr. Cherry at the Harbor Hospital.

Charles J. von Arnold, or "Baron" Rob
ert Ludwlg von Turkheim, will be remem
bered by at least one San Franciscan. The
Baron on April 13. 1S97, while acting in the
capacity of a private detective went
through a marriage ceremony in Oakland
with Jeannie Shurtleff Young, who was
making life miserable for Attorney D. M.
Delmas. whom she claimed as the father
of her child. The pair went East Imme
diately.
Von Turkheim and his newly acquired
feminine incumbrance went to Montreal
and from there to London, where the wo
man was deserted by her lord. Von
Turkheim was subsequently arrested for
obtaining Â£146 from a . hair dresser by
fraudulently representing himself to be
the heir to a large estate in Germany. At
the Newington sessions of July 15 he was
sentenced to serve one Â¦ year in prison.
The fact came out during his trial . that
four. women. claimed- him as husband.
The woman who was his true wife sued
Von Turkheim here in the meantime for
a divorce on the ground of desertion and
obtained it, together with_permlssion to
resume her maiden name, Emma Paul,
"Baron" von Arnold, alias Turkheim,
whose marriage to Jennie Young in Oak
land some time ago caused a sensation
in certain circles. Is under arrest in
Amsterdam. He was caught with a quan
tity of stolen goods in his possession and
as he was unable to account for them he
was held pending Investigation.
Yesterday Captain of Detectives Sey
mour received the following communica
tion from the Inspector of Police of
Amsterdam:
"We have arrested Charles von Arnold,
alias Baron von Turkheim, for grand
larceny. He had some stolen property In
his possession and we are holding him
pending an investigation. From state
ments made by him and if he can be be
lieved his parents were Charles and Eliza
Van Winkle. He claims he served In tho
Royal Saxon Sixth Infantry at Strasburg,
but I sincerely doubt It. From what in
formation we have he was employed as a
private detective In various parts of the
United States with little or no success. In
the latter part of 1899 Von Arnold, as he
was known, passed through Newcastle
Kngland, on the way to Paris. We had
information that he was bent on some
gigantic bunko scheme. His plans must
have failed, as he lost no time In getting
out of Paris and migrating to Amsterdam.
He represented himself as a Journalist
and claimed that he was the representa
tive of several Eastern periodicals.
"We learned by investigation that his
only claim to being a 'Journalist' was that
he was engaged in selling old newspapers
tnat had been sent from the' United
: States. Convinced that he was an lm
poster, we watched him. To our sur
prise be visited police headquarters and
claimed that he had been robbed of con
: siderable jewelry while in the hotel in
which he was stopping. We found out
the story was untrue and finally decided
to arrest him. In his room we found a
lot of stolen property.
"There were also documents showing
ho had sent a communication to the Consul
General of the. South' African republic In
Paris demanding money. "While there he
represented himself as a friend of the re
public and had been specially employed to
arrange a suitable exhibit. Von Arnold
Eassed as the confidential agent of Dr
Â«yds of South Africa. He claimed that
he was engaged by him to purchase pro
visions and munitions of war for the peo
ple of the Transvaal.
"From letters found on him we are sat
isfied that he intended to perpetrate a
; gigantic swindle on some people at Monte
Carlo. Among his victims was a man
i named Barnes. The latter was stopping
i.at Monte Carlo, and Von Arnold decided
to pluck him. He sent his intended victim
a telegram arranging for a meeting, and
he replied that he would see him at anv
time.
"The arrest of: the alleged Baron pre
vented him from carrying out his scheme."
In "concluding. the writer asked that the
police of this city send a complete record
of Von Arnold's career here.
Under the Name of Turkheim He
Married Jennie Young of This
City and Basely Deserted
Her in London.
The Bogus "Baron" Ar
rested by the Police of

Two Late Victims of Footpads and a Momentary Suspect.
s-ir-aHE footpad who shot down Fred
i Bortzmeyer shortly before 1 o'clock
il yesterday morning will not go to
Oakland, for over there the street
lamps shine when needed most. If he
â¢wishes to continue his operations with
Buccess and safety from apprehension by
the police, this city, with its streets en
veloped In Inky blackness. Is the place.
Running through the public of San
Francisco Is a strong feeling of re
sentment against the Mayor and the
Board of Supervisors for their econ
omy in regard to the lighting of the
city. It is at their door the crimes will
be laid, for the blackness of the night, un
relieved by proper municipal lighting, has
been a veritable invitation to the mid
night marauders and highwaymen, who
have been terrifying citizens.
Si. I>ou!s has tried the experiment of
unlighted streets, and this incentive to i
crime has already been found a bugbear j
in that city. Burglary and highway rob-
Lery increased tenfold under the change
from ilght to dark thoroughfares. Dili
gt-r.t as the police authorities were no sug
gested or attempted remedy for the evil
Â¦wrought any material good until the citi
zens rose up in their wrath and shouted
for the light of the street lamps.
Bortzmt-yer, the latest victim, bids fair
to recover. He was removed yesterday
morning from the Receiving Hospital to
the Waldeek Sanatorium and the bullet
Â¦was extracted. At a late hour last night
his condition was much improved, so
much sÂ»o that the physicians attending
him have every hope for his ultimate re
covery.
The facts leading to the identification of
the highwayman are few and the police
are still floundering in a f=c.-a of uncer
tainty as far as any definite clew is con
cerned. Several people heard the shot
fired, but no one saw the footpad long
enough to givo a description nt him. MrÂ«.
Leigh H. Irvine, who r<5idef at S06 Ellis
street, directly in front of which the hold
up occurred, was reading in the front
room of the second story of the house
when the shot wa? fired. Previous to the
pistol report c he heard low talking. As
eoon as the shot was fired she rushed to
the window, opened It and stepped out on
the veranda Just In time to see Bortz
meyer fall face down upon the sidewalk.
She heard him groan and call five times:
"Help, I'm shot." Then a man crossed
the street, lit a match, and. after looking
at the victim's face, put a coat under his
head. He was soon joined by another
man, who began blowing a police whistle,
which brought a small crowd to the
scone.
The police thought for a time yesterday
afternoon that they were on the track of
something suspicious. J. Ginnlnl, who
lives in the basement of 806 Ellis street,
was the man upon whom the suspicion
fastened. Some one reported to the police
that the stories of Ginnini and his wife
differed and that there was probable cause
tc doubt the husband's account of the
shooting.. According to reports the wife
said her husband had left the house im
mediately prior to the shooting and re
turned directly after it, but this was sub
sequently denied.
Ginnini was put upon the grill by Cap
tain Seymour and Mrs. Ginnini was inter
rogated by Detectives Dillon and Mc-
Mahon. The wife's statement to the police
is as follows;:
"I was in bed last night some time after
12 o'clock, and my husuand came home
and went to bed, too. This was before
the shooting. We were in bed about half
an hour, when we heard the shooting.
Then I heard Mr. Bolger, the landlord, I
think it was. get up. I am not sure
whether It Â¦was Mr. or Mrs. Bolger.
Neither I nor my husband got up. I
wanted to get up, but my husband would
not allow me, as I am subject to faint
in? spells. My husband came home after
12 o'clock, and I asked him to get me
something to eat. He looked out the
gate, but did not leave It and came back
and told me it was too dark; that all the
stores were closed, and he came back and
went to bed. About a quarter of an hour
after that the shooting occurred."
The husband's statement was: "I came
home about 12 o'clock from 209 Post street.
I was working there as waiter up to 12
o'clock. I came, home with Mr. Galvani,
tho music teacher. I left him at his resi
dence on Ellis street, between Hyde and
Larkin. Then I went to my house and
went to bed. My wife wanted me to get
her something to eat and I told her it
was too late. I did not go out of the
house at all. I did not even go to the
front door. If my wife says so, she is
mistaken. Between 20 and 30 minutes
after I got into bed I heard one shot and
then I heard a cry, I think from Mrs.
Irvine. Neither I nor my wife got up.
My wife wanted to, but 1 would not let
her. as I don't care about interesting my
self in anything that does not concern
me." .' . â¢
When Bortzmeyer had delivered up his
money to the highwayman the latter
reached for his watch. This Bortzmeyer
refused to surrender, as it was a gift
from his father, but the footpad was in
sistent. Whire drawing back he caught
hold of the chain and a slight scuffle en
eued. Then the footpad used his weapon.
Bortzmeyer thinks that the hjghwayman
was nervous and did not intend to shoot.
The detectives working on the case
found the watch yesterday morning in the
garden of 740 Ellis street, the block east
of the scene of the hold-up. It Is a large
silver timepiece and of no great intrinsic
value. Whether the highwayman rid him
self of this property tor fear of possible
identification if he -held It in his posses
sion or that Its discovered, value made It
not worthy of the keeping is a matter of
conjecture. Bortzmeyer's own story
makes the watch the vital cause of. the
shooting.
His father, who gave him the timepiece,
is now speeding across the country to' his
eon's bedside. As soon as he received a
telegram of his boy's misfortune he
started forthwith from Cleveland, Ohio.
Miss Grace Hale of San Diego, the sweet
heart of young . Bortzmeyer. Is also en
route to this city. She will arrive to-day,
and If the victim of the footpad's mur
derous ppirit is In condition to see her she
will be admitted to his bedside.
The police have in their possession a
black silk rag which may or may not have
been worn by the highwayman. It was
more likely torn from the dress of one of
the women who gathered around the vic
tim after the shooting. The 5ilk was
dampened by water and bore the appear
ance of a mop. On account of this it is
supposed that some of the women used It
to wipe the face of Bortzmeyer as he lay
in agony on the sidewalk.
SAME MAN, SAYS HEDBURG.
So Black Was the Night That He Did
Not Have a Chance.
Charles. Hedburg, who is the proprietor
of the oyster stall of t the Foxhall market,
on Fillmore street, near Clay, is a victim
who bears a grudge to the dark nights
without lamps. He said yesterday that
were it not for the utter darkness he
wcu!d have had a chance and his $20
would not have fled. Â¦, Â¦'Â¦, '.wv> .-.-:..,
"The man who held me up was of mid
dlr height and of stocky build," he said
yesterday. "I didn't have a chance. It
was no dark I didn't know what the game
was until the pistol was flashed In my
facÂ«Â». He wore a black mask as far 'down
as his mouth. His clothes were dark, and
that is all I can tell about him."
From the meager description given by
Bortzmeyer, Hedburg is of the opinion
that both hold-ups were the work of one
man.

FREDERICK W. ZEILE, Park Com

â¢ the suspicion of being a midnight

that genial gentleman will be surprised
tc learn that for a short period last. Tues
day night he was In danger of arrest and
other dire calamities because of the foot
pad scare which has "struck "the scintil

and the citizens of this city.
Mr. Zeile visited friends on Van Ness
avenue on that fateful evening and dur
ing a game; of whist the subject of hold
ups was discussed. As Mr. Zeile had some
distance to travel to reach his home, the
conversation did not comfort him or pre
pare him for the events that followed.
When he. departed for home the avenue
was dark' and desolate. Mayor Phelan'a
Board of Supervisors had doused the glim
and although Mr. Zeile was reappointed
to his position by his Honor, that fact
did not deter him from-uttering- Impre

sioner, like a wise man, sought the mid
dle of the road. He had traveled a short
diaUmce when he brought up against an
oostruction of barrels guarding the part
ly constructed conduits of the Independent
Light and Power Company. While try
ing to find his way around theobstacle he
faintly discerned the figure of a man
crouched behind a barrel. Visions of
Vetsera and other disciples of Claude Du
val and Jack Shepard rose before him.
and with a determination in his heart not
to surrender his jewels and lucre with
out a struggle, he seized a heavy piece of
wood and boldly faced his supposed foot
pad. To his surprise the crouching fig
ure' avoided the meeting by sidling
round the obstruction. Mr. Z*ile follow

the unknown were playing "tag." At

"tagged" on the lapel and was startled to
hear the word "halt." He turned to give
battle, but was confronted -with a star,
which gleamed in the darkness like the

ZEILE AND A "COP" MISTAKE
EACH OTHER FOR FOOTPADS
MYSTERIOUS DEATH.
Coroner's Investigations Tend to Es
tablish the Fact That Field Was
Murdered.
The death of Frank Field, the linotyper,
is Bhrouded In mystery, although the po
lice appear to be satisfied that it Â¦was a
case of suicide. Acting upon this theory
they released from custody yesterday Mrs.
M. A. Norton, the woman who had been
living with Field at 209 Kearny street.
Before being released she made a state
ment to Detective Ross Whittaker In
which she said she had been associated
with Field for the past eight months and
had lived with him at 200 Kearny street
for three months. The money he had In
herited had been spent at the races and
for drink, which made him despondent.
He was very jealoua of her and had
threatened to kill her and then himselr.
Last Sunday he went to a saloon on Ma
son street searching for her with the in
tention of murdering her. She was warned
by friends and kept out of his way.
Wednesday he was very despondent and
acted as if he were crazy. He had sent
her trunk to her home at G2 Rausch street.
She was afraid of him, as he kept telling
her that he was tired of life. He had re
tired Wednesday night and she entered
the room and sat down on the bedside.
Suddenly he took his revolver and aiming
it at her fired a shot. She ran out of the
room, screaming, and could not tell if any
more shots were tired, as she was too ex
cited. She called : the landlady, and she
went back to tho room with her and found
Field had shot himself.
Autopsy Surgeon Leland found that
Field's skull had been fractured with some
blunt instrument just above the right ear.
The bullet â¢wound was high up on the fore
head and the course of the bullet was
downward and to the right. A significant
fact in connection with the fractured skull
is that the tips of the fingers of the right
hand are powder burned, thus indicating
that he threw up his hands to ward oft
the shot that killed him. He could not
have fired the pistol unless he had used
his. thumb to pull the trigger, and it is
not likely that he would have done that.
Dr. Leland la of the opinion that the man
Â¦was murdered by being struck on tho
head and afterward shot.
â¢ Another significant fact that points to
the murder theory is the repose in which
the body rested on the bed. The head
was propped up on a pillow at the foot of
the bed, a book lay to one side and the
feet were crossed in an easy position. It
is hard to â¢ explain how the man could
have lain so peacefully if he had made
an attempt to kill the woman and then
shot himself. It would be easy, however,
for a person to step up to the foot of
the bed, place a revolver near his head
and fire.
The revolver shows that but one shot
had been fired. This disputes the wo
man's â¢ statement that a shot was first
fired at her. ;
Suspicious Characters Arrested.
Two young men giving their names as
George Dorman and Ovid Long were
taken into custody by Officer Robl early
this morning at Geary and Lark In streets.
A small "Jimmy" about six inches long
was taken from them. They told con
flicting stories and will be held at tho
Central police station as suspicious char
acters.
Nothing that would tend to dispel the
cloud of mystery overshadowing the
tragic death of Sergeant Robert Wilson,
who was shot on Lake street Tuesday
night, has yet been brought to light by the
police. Ida de Ferreri continues to make
contradictory statements.
The police are inclined to think that the
soldier took his own life, and they seem
disposed to rest on this theory. Still noth
ing has yet been established that will bear
out their views, while the peculiar char
acter of the wound, the absence of powder
marks, the distance the revolver was
found from the body, and, above all, the
sole witness" contradictory statements,
are all against them. ,
That Ml.Â«s fie Ferreri i3 withholding the
truth about what she knows and saw on
that fateful night is apparent even to the
police. Yesterday she made additional
statements, whicii were calculated to ex
plain the discrepancies in her previous
versions. They only dragged her deeper
Into the meshes of "doubt.
The woman now makes the statement
that she saw Wilson with the pistolin his
hand when he rushed from her house. She
says she followed him to the scene of the
shooting and was four feet to the rear
when the soldier fell. Until this time the
woman had said nothing of seeing a pis
tol and' gave the impression that she was
walking along leisurelv with her compan
ion at the moment of the tragedy.
That this statement is untrue Is proven
by many witnesses. Mrs. Casassa says
it was nfteen minutes after the time her
sister left the house before the shot was
fired. Miller, in front of whose house the
affair occurred, says that Wilson and his
companion walked down the road quarrel
ing and continued the row at the corner
ot his fence. They went on down the
road, but returned in about five minutes.
Then came the shots.
The only evidence that would bear out
a theory of suicide is the statement of
the woman that Wilson, on several occa
sions, had threatened to take his life on
account of love for ner. The only quarrel
on that day seems not to have been be
cause the woman did not reciprocate his
affections, but ratt.er because he did not
keep an appointment with her at 1 o'clock.
That Wilson had slight reason to be
jealous is clear. Miss de Ferreri was not
married to Soldier uermer, as she claim
ed, and her love for Wilson was manifest.
The revolver which young Kessack took
from the residence of Mrs. Casassa wa3
found yesterday on Lake street, near
Fourteenth avenue, by James Keating of
227 Twentieth avenue. The finding of the
weapon Is not significant, as It was un
loaded and cut no figure In the tragedy,
except to prove that young Kessack must
have gone to the Erasma house after tho
shot was fired, as Cuneo eays he did, and
that the woman's story that he was the
first on the scene was false.
Miss De Ferreri Was Jealous Bather
Than the Man When They
Went Together Into the
Night.
