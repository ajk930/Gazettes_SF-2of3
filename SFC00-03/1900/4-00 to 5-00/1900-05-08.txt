iVINBURG AND SMALDEEL
CAPTURED BY STRATEGY
SMALDEEL. May 7.â The movement
that culminated in the capture of Win
burg and Smaldeel was part of a great
general movement extending from Gen
eral Hunter on the west to General Run
dle on the east. General Roberts* admir
able strategy resulted in placing every
where five Llritlsh to one Boer. Out of
what appeared td be inextricable confu
eion or divisions and brigades order was
<juickly evolved and the Boers were com
pelled to meet I>ord Roberts under unfa
vorable conditions.
What is more Important is that the
British are now able to wait. Their front
and strong positions are safe In their
knowledge that their flanking columns
will advance and outflank the Boers.
Yer terday the Boers held a really strong
position, from which earlier in the cam
paign they could only have been forced by
bard fighting. General Hamilton's arrival
at Winburg, although not directly out
flanking the Boers, made their position
extremely uncomfortable. General Hut
ton's movement on the left was even more
successful than at first imagined. Forty
Boers were killed.
The march to-da.y was short, but Gen
eral Pole Carew's division marched fifty
eight miles in four days.
General Tucker's division is marching
on our left to-day and General Maxwell's

Despite the efforts made by the police to

for his home In that neighborhood short
ly before the hold-up, he now Btands.
through Bortzmeyer's positive declara
tion, entirely cleared of all the suspicion
In connection with that affair that has
been directed toward since his ar
rest.
With the declaration ot Bortzmcyer
that Getz is not the man who held him
up and sent a bullet through his body,
the theory of Policeman Brown that Getz
was a bold, bad highwayman collapses
like a toy balloon and the subsequent
charge against him made by Sailor Zies
enbeln losrs all weight and brings up
prominently the bitter statement of Mr*.
Margaret Moore In regard to I>rown;S
motives in causing Getz's arrest. Â»
Made Bortzmeyer Smile. Â¦'.
Getz saw the injured man yesterday and
the latter smUed at the idea that his vis
itor was the man who shot him. declaring
he in no" 1 way resembled the murderously
Inclined footpad.
Wearying of the - suspicion directed
toward him by his arrest at the instiga
tion of Policeman Brown, the man who
had been openly accused of the desperate
crime committed on Ellis street decided
to take steps to settle all doubts in the
mind of the public as toy whether he fired
the shot. From the moment of his ar
rest Getz had expressed himself as will
ing to face Bortzmeyer and yesterday he
proved his sincerity by going before the
wounded man as stated. â¢
The weakness of the police case
against Getz was shown in court yester
day. The man who claims that Getz held
him up on Howard street last month did
not appear willingly in court when the
case was called. He was not present at
the hour set and there semed to be no
anxietv on the part of the officers over his
non-appearance. He was brought in later
by order of the court because Getz s at
torneys demanded that the sailor be pres
ent. / He will be put through a- severe
cross-examination by them when he goes
on the witness stand. ' .
Qetz Faces Bortzmeyer.
"Last evening; Getz presented himself at
the Waldack Sanitarium and asked to be
permitted to see the wounded man. Bortz
bieyer had passed a good day, with a nor
mal temperature, and upon his stating
that he would like to see the. man who
had been thrown into jail under^ suspicion
of shooting him Getz was shown up to
hl "OhÂ°Â°no' you're not the man: you're too
fat," said Bortzmeyer. turning, his head
on the pillow and gazing at Getzvwith a
smile on his white, drawn face. -Â¦
"You never t>aw me before, then? sug-
S< "No I nev ; er did," replied the footpad's
victim. "The man who shot me was Very
much shorter than you are; he_was slim
mer and had a different chin. It's easy to
see vou're not the man.
Getz was allowed to stay in the room
only about two minutes, it being feared
the patient might become excited. When
he entered the room Getz was somewhat
nervous, but when he came out he was
smiling with satisfaction. Though he had
no fear that Bortzmeyer would Identify
him as the robber, he was afraid the in
jured man might express a. doubt... Con
sequently Bortzmeyer's positive declara
tion that Getz was : not the robber was
very satisfactory to him.
Getz is about 5 feet 9 inches In height
and . weighs in the neighborhood of 190
P Getz S 'shook hands warmly with Bortz

that Boell was shot by a rival, who was

Wilson's Death a Kystery.
James Burn3 was held yesterday to
answer before the Superior Court by
Judge Mogan on a charge of robbery In
J20C0 bonds. He was accused of knocking
down Fred Houseman, an ex-convict, and
robbing him of $30 at Vallejo and Kearny
streets about a week aero. Houseman was
an unwilling witness for the prosecution.
Logan is a tall, smooth-faced youns
man. John3on is of medium height, has
a light mustache and a damaged nose.
Neither man fits the description given by
Bortzmeyer of the man who robbed him.
Neither would tell where he lived or
where he came from. Johnson showed
fight, even while handcuffed la Captain
Seymour's office. A receipt in Logan's
possession shows the watches and chains*
were bought at M. H. Blankenstein's. 630
Kearny street.
It is thought the men are recently from
the East and operate both in city and
country. Logan, however, claims he has
lived in th!3 city all his life. Johnson is
certainly the more experienced criminal
of the two. He claimed he never met
Logan before yesterday. Other questions
he would not answer and * told the police
and other questioners they could go find
their own answers to questions put.

found a large square neck muffler oC
heavy black figured silk. Johnson had
two pl3tols, both new, one of them beinjr
a 2S-caliber Hjnykins & Allen ami thÂ«
other a small Ss-caliber bulldog. He also
had a. new pocketknifehwith a blade al
most as large as that of a butcherknifo
and $3 45 in money. On Logan three new
drills for safe-breaking work, 8o cents inr
money and a State railroad guide were
found. The mufflere and pistols suggest
that the police may be nearer solving tho
mystery of the recent hold-ups than they
imagine. Â¦ - , .
Both men â¢ carried new watches worth
$1 Â»5 each and wore new chains of cheao
make. Each wore a new negligee shirt
of the same make. All these new article*
and the fact that they were drunk showed
they had just got hold o^, some money.
On Johnson wa3 found a key bearing;
the number 22. Detectives Wren and,
DInan, acting under Captain Seymour's
instructions, took the key and set out to>
find a door It would fit. They found that
the key readily unlocked the door of room
22 of the Dewey House. 765 Market street.
The proprietor said the room had been
rented the day before by two men. He
described Johnson and Logan. The of
ficers* searched tbe room and found a
splendid ratchet brace, such as la used In,
safe-drilling, and eight drills. Three of
these were covered with cement. In the
room were also found two suits of under
clothing, which the men had evidently;
discarded for new.
The police are convinced tho two prison
ers are all-round crooks. From the im
plements found in their possession It is
evident they Â¦ were prepared to do
footpad work, safe-cracking or anything;
in the criminal line.
The story of an alleged hold-up on
Montgomery street yesterday morning
was investigated by the police and found
to have been a palpable fake, woven out
of the imagination of a "pipe dreamer."
No person ever related such a story at
the saloon mentioned and there was ab
solutely no ground whatever on which
to base the talc. A report on the affair
and the causes which led to Its publica
tion have been made known to the Chief
of Police.

There Is a romance In connection with
young Bortzmeyer's coming to California.
His father was willing to keep him In lux
ury, but. had picked out a wife for himâ
a young lady with whom the boy had
been reared. The son-, said he did not
want to marry the girl, and the father,
piqued, told him if he refused he would
have to make his own way in the future.
Young Bortzmeyer accepted the alterna
tive, left home and has been supporting
himself since. Now comes a happy re
union through the medium of the foot
pad's-murderous bullet, which brings the

LONDON, May 8, 4:20 a. m.â Tho Boers are everywhere retiring before the
British except on the Natal frontier and at Maicking, to the inner circle
of their defenses. They appear determined not to fight until the Kroon
stad. hills are reached, s
Lord. Roberts is expected. to do another forty or fifty miles and then
w;ait for a time '-â¢ order to bring up supplies and repair the railway.* There are
ohe^or two hints in the dispatches from the front that he may rest for a few
days at - Smaldeel. â¢ .
General -French's 10,000 cavalry has not been mentioned in the official, or-un
official dispatches, for four days. It is by no means likely that he is Idle, and
the conjecture is that he Is either detouring toward I^roon3tad or raiding the
Ladybrand district. Fifteen thousand British are now operating on the western
frontier of the Free State. As tho deadlock at Warrenton has been broken and
the Boers are retreating there is nothing formidable, except distance, between
Warrenton and Maf eking. The most hopeful advices from Maf eking of April
22 were that the garrison would be barely able to hold out for a month. At that
time the fever was spreading. According to advices from Maseru, Basutoland
several thousand Free Staters are north of Ladybrand, where they have collect
ed great herds. The district Is rich in food for 'men and horses, and the Boers

Bortzmeyer Declaring That Getz Is Not the Man Who Robbed and Shot Him.
LONDON, Kay 8.â Two more important points have been captured In the
onward sweep of Roberts' great army. From the press correspondents
word comes confirming the reported seizure by. General Ian Hamilton's
column of Winburg. Lord Roberts himself reported the equally Important
strategic success of the taking of Smaldeel. or "Winburg road, which". Is
the Junction point of the main line from Bloemfonteln to Pretoria and the
branch running southeast to Winburg. j *<
Details are now coining In concerning the brisk fight for Vet River. From
Brandfort to tho Vet is a distance of nineteen miles. General Pale-Carew start
ed with his division at daybreak to march to the river. He arrived at Eensge
ronen, the first station south of the Vet. about midday, and here he halted. The
West Australians, -who covered the advance column, discovered at 1 o'clock
Boers in the river bed. being fired on by the burghers at a distance of 300 yards.
The artillery, comprising the Eighty-fourth and Eighty-fifth batteries, pushed
forward, escorted by General Stephenson's brigade. These batteries caused the
gruns in the main Boer position to unmask. Other pieces of the enemy's artil
lery caire into action on the British right. - The Eighty-fourth Battery moved
away to engage them, leaving the other battery to answer the guns In the Boer
center. Two naval lÂ£-pounders, two 2.4-lnch and two 5-inch guns, coming suc
cessively into action, soon altered the aspect of affairs, the two Boer guns being
temporarily silenced.
Meanwhile General Hutton, who was well to the west with the Canadians,
Australians, New ZeaJanders and British mounted infantry, attacked the Boers
at the drift by which they intended to cross. The Boers, who were led in this
portion, of the field by General Lucas Mayer, second In command of the Fed
eral troops, had the advantage in number of machine guns, but the mounted
Britishers managed to drive their antagonists out of the river bed, crossed the
river and took up a position which outflanked their right. General Hutton dur
ing the night sent two squadrons to blow up the railway near Smaldeel, in the
hope that by doing this he could capture some rolling stock, but the last train
northward had left the Junction Saturday evening.
From the southeast ar.d west ccme news showing that the surge forward
of the main body of the British army is pushing back the Boers on both sides.
Fourteen Streams, where for six weeks the Boers have fired across Vaal River
at the British forces, near "VVarrenton, has been evacuated. The British there,
under Colonel Paget, have been joined by General Hunter and have crossed the
river.
The Thaba Nchu force of the er.omy has left the strong position which they
held confronting General Rundle. and the British troops have taken possession
of it. Like a. broad arrow the British advance is now piercing the Boers' po
sition in the Free State. From the Winburg hills to the left it is extended to
ward Boehof and Warrcnton. while oa the right it runs southeast to the north
of Thaba Nchu and Wepener.
What Roberts' next strategical move will be it is difficult to guess. , The
temptation to try to keep the Boers on the run must be a great one, but I? is
thought mo3t probable here that the field marshal will now bring up his wings
and endeavor to"clear the country' from Blotmhoef to Harrismith.

SAl'SALITO. May 7.-Offlcers and
toughs mingled In a pitched battle at
Bufna Vista Park yesterday, and it was
only after a. hard Etrugrerle that the former
wrested the victory from their adver
saries:. .
Shortly after noon Constable John
Creed received word that a gang of
toughs was creating a rough house out
at the park and that serious trouble was
anticipated. Creed left at once for the
scene of action and while attempting to
arrest the ringleaders was "jumped" by
the whole crowd.
Creed laid lustlJy about him with fists
and club, but he was outnumbered and
might have fared badly at the hands of
his assailants had nut some sailors come
to his rescue. The allied forces succeeded
In routing the enemy, when a woman over
whom the row had originated urged her
"pals" on to the attacic again. By this
time, however,' reinforcements ln the
shape of Constable Hlchard Garrlty and
Night Watchman Paul Touett arrived,
and the latter's bulldog soon caused the
toughs to plead for an armistice. This
was granted and the triumphant officlalb
left the park, after having arrested A.
D. Gannon and John Fisher, both em
ployes of the Pacific Mail dock. The men
will come up for trial to-morrow, being
at present out on bonds, secured by the
intervention of Town Trustee Sylva.

METHODISTS
CONFRONTED BY
RACE QUESTION
Divided as to the Election
of a Colored Man as
Southern Delegates Will Vote Sol
idly for the Innovation, but
the North Stands
Opposed.
CHICAGO. May 7.â As the time ap
proaches for settling: the question of how
many Bishops are to be elected by the
Methodist General Conference the senti
ment is growing among the delegates that
none of the present occupants of the high
office should be retired and placed on the
superannuated list. It seems probable
that because of the advanced age of sev
eral members of the episcopacy the com
mittee on episcopacy will recommend the
election of rive additional Bishops. . Three
will. bu for work ln this country and two
to supervise tne missionary Avork in Asia.
This is the programme In favor with a
majority of the members of the committee
on episcopacy. The committee to-day be
gan active work on the question referred
lo it by the conference. , .' .. : .'Â¦
There are twenty or more avowed candi
dates for the high office of Bishop, not
withstanding the fact that it is not likely
that more than five additions to the pres
ent board of episcopacy will be made.
Among those most prominentlv mentioned
for Bishop are: Dr. J. W. Hamilton of
New York, Dr. J. F. Berry. of Chicago. Dr.
Henry Spellmeyer of New York, Dr. T. 13.
Neely ot Philadelphia. Dr. "William F. Mc-
Dowell of Colorado and Dr. \V. C. Kelly
of New York.
It Is probable that much opposition to
the election of a colored Bishop will ap
pear when the matter Is taken up by the
conference. The Southern delegates, it is
said, will vote solidly in favor of the inno
vation, but hundreds of representatives
of the Northern conferences will oppose
it. The great number of Â¦white candidates
for Bishop, It is believed, will operate
against the chances of Dr. .T. E. Bowcn of
Washington, the leading colored aspirant,
and several prominent delegates declare
that the election of Dr. Bowen by the
present conference is by no means cer
tain.
fThe committee on temperance to-day lis
tÂ«Â»ned to the reading of several memorials
referred to it by the General Conference.
One memorial condemned President Mc-
Kinley for laxity ln enforcing the anti
canteen law, and was generally discussed,
but no action was taken. Another recom
mendation was made amending the book
of discipline so that members of the church
who rent their property for saloon pur
poses may be brought to trial. They were
all referred to the sub-committee for con
sideration.

ceptable to tne Silver Republican*. Of
course In the Ehort time 1 have been here
1 have not been able to see a great many
members of me party, but those whom I
have seen are perfectly united upon tho
proposition that all must be done that it
if possible to do to secure absolute har-
Riouy among Populists, Democrats and
Silver Republicans in the support of Mr.
Bryan; and 1 believe the party will be
tound equal to the surrender of both nom
inees in order to secure ihis paramount
desideratum. Jn fact. I speak within
bounds when I say that never within the
JUisiory of the country has any party ever
Bhown such unselfishness and such devo
tion to principle as the I'eopie's party
has shown in the past and is willing tiÂ»
ehow now to bring victory to a cause."
The Senator refused tu give any ex
pression of opinion concerning the bolting
Populists, who are to hold tnelr conven
tion at Cincinnati, further than to say:
"They represent nobody but .themselves,
and need not be dignified by a reference
to them."
Secretary Kdgertoa epoke more freely
concerning the bolt, which hÂ» explained
originated r.t the Klncoin meeting of the
National Committee last February.
'"In reality, only one member "of that
committee walked out of the committee,
and he was accompanied bv onlv four
proxies." he said. "These, "with "a few
other rejected proxies, call^J the Cincin
nati convention."
Text of the Platform.
In the matter of the platform to be
adopted by the convention the opinion is
very general that the St. l,ouis declara
tion or principles will l,e reiterated, with
variations and additions.
"We will express our opinions In no un.
certain way on the questions of trusts and
imperiaiiBm.*" said a I'nited States Sena
tor who is h deiepate. "We will certainly
take h position on the point of attempting
to eovern any people without their con
sent. Ac to trusts, we shall not content
oure-ehes with denouncing them, but shall
offfr a remedy. That remedy is to con
irol the instruments of commerce, money,
transportation and the transmission of in
telligence. In our St. Ixiuis platform we
took the position that all thtse functions,
should Ije controlled by the CJovernment.
We will accomplish our end if we point
out that to assume this control will bt to
suppress the trusts, and, furthermore, we
will attempt nothing new in this efTort,
nothing requiring- a change in the consti
tution, for all that is here set out is pro
vided for in that instrument."
The financial plank of the St. Louis
platform will be unchanged, and the gold
standard bill passed nt the present ses
sion of Congress will be denounced as in
the interest of national banks and dan
gerous to the best interests of the public
at large.
The Porto Rico legislation will be de
nounced, and it will be declared that the
constitution follows the flas in the acnui
â¢itlnn of territory. The Republican party
will be charged with failure to keep faith
ln Cuba and with transcending all bounds
of propriety in the management of the
Philippine question. Militarism w!H p'av
sn important part in the platform. The
matter of increasing the standing' army
of the I'nit-d States will be frowned upon
as riv1rÂ«r the Piesident the power to de
prive voters of the rin-ht of franchise bv

SAN JOSE, May 7. â The charges pre
ferred against Mrs. C. L. Place, the prin
cipal of the training department of the
Stato Normal School, by Henry E. Miller
and Miss Lizzie Kelly, pupils, who were
refused. graduation, were Investigated be
fore the full Board of Trustees of the
school to-day. Trustee Frank H. Short
of Fresno presided. over the Investigation.
Other members present were: Trustees
H. C. Brown of San Jose, F. A. Leavitt
of Oakland. F. : W. Pierce ot Woodland,
George Sweigert of San Jose and State
Superintendent , Kirk of Sacramento.
Miller's : c.iso whs the tirst^ taken up.
The charges against Mrs. -. Place were
read. Miller was conditioned in manual
training In the training department by
Mrs.- Place and refused graduation and
later the faculty passed a resolution refus
ing Miller further admission to the school.
In the charges he accuses Mrs. Place of
being not ai-.lU and proper person for her
position In 'that she is easily, biased and
prejudiced: guilty of practices unbecom
ing a- teacher: that she conditioned schol
ars without cause and told deliberate
falsehoods tobolstcr up her. acts.' Miller
also charges that Mrs. Place circulated
thai statement, that 'â¢Â¦he was mentally un
balanced: andr had- been -refused gradua
tion In r other, normal schools and In this
manner, greatly injured him." .. ..-;
Mrs. J. W. , Rockwell was tho first wit
ness for Miller. She said Mrs. Place said
Miller was mentally unbalanced and 'un
fit-to have charge of a; school: that the
boys called. him "Crazy Miller.'-' He had
gone around and visited parents of pu
pils" under' him and- these parents had
complained. Mrs.'. Place said his morals
were good,- In methods he stood > well, but
he was deficient In Intellect.
George Â« SciiulUberg, a pupil.' Bald while
a member of the Youne Men's Normal
Debating v Society ' the . organization had
unanimously adopted a resolution declar
ing Miller of "high Christian .character"
and that "he is level-headed and should
receive and is entitled to a diploma.".
A large batch of evidence was then pre
sented by Miller to prove his sanity.i Dr.
Lincoln. Cothran; had known Miller for
some time. At first he thought Miller an
irresponsible crank, but heiwas soon con

MILLIONAIRE'S SON ....
WEDS A CHORUS GIRL
In connection with this story the Frels
sinnlge Zeltung recalls that Emperor Wil
liam on ascending the throne was solicited
by the highest officer of the army to ap
point himself a general, having been
hitherto a major general, and that the
Kaiser complied. â¢ ;
To-day some additional facts about the
festivities in connection with the coming
of age of the Crown Prince became
known. It seems that Emperor William
received telegrams of warmest congratu
lations from â¢ Kmperor Nicholas. Queen
Victoria. King Humbert, King Ixjopold.
King Charles of Roumanla and the Kin*;
and Queen of Sweden. During the gala
banquet Emperor William conferred the
Order of the Black Eagle on the Duke ot
Operto. The members of the Russian
military delegation received high decora
tions, "in the course of the reception Em
peror William called Count von Walder
pee to the throne and Informed him of
his appointment as tield marshal general.
"Thereupon," rays the Lokal Anzeiger.
"Field Marshal General Prince Albert of
Prussia, as the oldest officer in the Ger
man army, and General von Hahnke
asked Emperor William in- the name of
the army to appoint himself a field mar
shal. The Kaiser's decision is expected
very soon."
BERLIN. May 7.â Although Emperor
Francis Joseph and the princely visitors
have gone Berlin has not yet resumed Its
normal aspect. Notwithstanding the ab
normal heat to-day the streets were un
usually crowded, many persons only now
venturing out to see the decorations.

John, for many years a prominent citizen
of this county, died at his late residence
near Arroyo Grande to-day. I Deceased
was a native of Ohio and had served In
Company H. Seventy-third Indiana Vol
unteers. Two sons, one of whom. Warren
M. John, Is connected with a local and a
San Francisco paper and was recently
elected grand senior beadle of. the Grand
Court of Foresters, survive him.
An investigation of the charges made bv
Lizzie Kelly will follow the Miller case
and It. Is more than probable she will be
given a . diploma,, although the facts of
her case are very similar to that of Mil
ler's.
But few spectators have so far been
present. Miller is conducting his own
case and as prosecutor has dug up an
immense amount of evidence, mucn of
which will count for naught. If he were
given full swing tho investigation would
last several days. The general impres
sion Is that the faculty will be sustained
and Miller will not get his certificate.
The trustees took a trip to Congress
Springs this evening and failed to hold
the evening session. The Investigation
will be resumed to-morrow morning at 9
o'clock. At that time Miller will take
the stand and tell his story and Mrs.
Place -will follow with a general denial of
all the facts brought out by Miller. Some
Interesting testimony is expected.
A letter was read by the Trustees that
Miller had written to Governor Gage, in
which he appealed to the executive to
Interfere and have a thorough investiga
tion. In criticising the school Miller said:
"I will admit that if we had a man for
president and the school was out of per
sonal politics this state of affairs might
be, remedied to a certain extent, but with
a so-called man with the backbone of an
angleworm presiding over its destinies it
only shows what may be done in an In
stitution without law."
sossed of preat perseverance and dis
played these staying powers under obsta
cles that would stagger most people. Let
ters testifying to Miller's sanity were
read from Drs. Â£â¢ E. Hailstone and Keith
of this city, Drs. A. K. Fowler and W.
D. Towsley of Ohio, Dr. Stansbury of
Chico and Dr. Shurtlefl of L.03 Anseles.
Melville Dozier, vice president of the
Los Angeles Normal School, in a letter
said Miller had not been expelled from
that school, but had left of his own free
will.

Note.
WASHINGTON, May 7.â The announced
Intention of the Turkish Government to
transfer the conduct of the negotia
tions respecting the American indemnity
claims from Constantinople to Washing
ton has not been manifested as yet in any
official form. The Department of State
is thoroughly satisfied with the manner
In which Mr. Griscom. the United States
charge d'affaires at Constantinople, has
conducted his work and has no disposi
tion to change Its methods Jn the mid
dle of a negotiation such as this. There
have been no recent exchanges of notes
or even verbal representations respecting
the American demands, and, possibly, this
temporary lull may be the foundation for
the supposition that the negotiations have
been transfererd to Washington.
At this particular juncture the United
States Government has had the last say
and is now awaiting a response from the
Turkish Government to a very forcible
presentation of the reasons why It should
redeem thÂ« Sultan's promise, made to Mr.
Straus and to his predecessors, to pay
for the American missionary property de
stroyed.

NEW YORK. May 7.â At to-day's meet
ing of the board of directors of the Amer

Seli^man and Frederick W. Strauss re
signed from the board. Subsequently the
following was made public:
To t!ie Board of Directors of the American
Eteel and Wire Company â Gentlemen: We have
to-day resigned from the directory of the
American Steel and Wire Company because
John \V. Â¦ Gates did not at to-day's meet
ing retire from the : management of the
company, a* we had been Eiven to un
derftand that he would. Our reasons for con
tinuing to act ss director* until now may
perhaps deserre further explanation. On the.
morning of the April meeting of the board
we riÂ»cÂ«?ived assurances from sources on which
we thought ourselves entitled to rely that
the reslcnatlon of Mr. Gates an chairman
would be offered about May L While it is true
that while, continuing In the board we exposed
ourselves to possible misconstruction we risked
this in the belief that by delay we should ac
complish what every one must reoojmlze was
demanded by the best Interest! of the com
pany, namely, Mr. Gates' retirement from the
management, and we realized that under the
by-laws of the company to force Mr. Gates'
retirement waÂ» practically Impossible and that
the*e affuranws promised more substantial re
sults than the contemplated attempt to force
his Immediate resignation.
Mr. Gates, however, continues to control the
company, and under these circumstances it be
comes impossible for us longer to continue in
the. directory, and In order that the stockhold
ers of the company may fully understand both
our reasons for oontlnulng In the board and
for resigning from It we shall give such pub
licity to this letter a* we may think proper.
Toura truly. HEN'RT SELIGMAN.

If the constitution does not extend to Porto
Rico and our other new acquisitions of terri
tory. Congress has the untrammeltd absolute
power to establish subject governments or
make laws for such territories: It has the
power to establish dependent monarchies or
satrapies, etate religions and even slavery.
The argument of one of the Senator* referred
to that the last clause of the thirteenth amend
ments prevents the establishment there of
slavery is obviously lame and impotent, for If
the constitution does not extend to thow* parts
of the domain of the United States, nor limit
Congress In Its powers ot legislation over
them, by what process will this single clause
of an amendment of that Instrument detach
Itself from the skin of the parchment and alone
fasten Itself upon these new territories? If It
be considered that this clause, of the thirteenth
amendment, rex proprla vigore, extends to these
new territories, or limits the powers of Con
gress respecting them, every clause of that
Powers of Congress.
Our general covernment was founded by the
men of the revolution who had rebelled against
the arbitrary power asserted by Great Britain
to govern her outlying colonies at the. will ot
her Parliament. They established the Gov
ernment upon the as&erted .theory that all Just
powers of government come from the consent
of the governed. They founded, as described
by President Lincoln in language not yet rot
gotten. "A government of the people, by the
people, for the people." It will be. Indeed,
marvelous If It Is to appear that these men
who then founded our imtlonal Ciovernment so
constructed It that It Is capable of ruling
with unlimited power a subject people who
have neither ruarantees to protect them nor
any voicÂ« In the Government. This is foreign
absolutism â the worst form of tyranny.
The decision has evoked great inter
est throughout the country, as It bears
largely on constitutional questions which
have arisen on the question of Porto
Rico as a territory of the United States.
The decision states:
Judge Lochren refused the application
In an oral decision Thursday last and to
day filed an exhaustive opinion thereon.
Ortiz was convicted by a military tribu
nal In Porto Rico for the murder of a
United States soldier and condemned to
die. Tho Fentence was commuted to life
Imprisonment.
The application for release was based
on the claim that .the military authorities
had no Jurisdiction over Ortiz; that peace
had been declared and that he should
have had a civil trial.
ST. PAUL, May 7.â Judge Lochren to
day filed in the United States Cir
cuit Court his decision on the ap
plication of Rafael Ortiz, a Porto
Rlcan. to be released from the Min
nesota State Prison.
It muft be held that upon the cession by Spain
to the Ur:!t<;d States of the Island of Porto Ulco
that Island became a part of the dominion of
the United States, as much as Is Arizona or
Minnesota, and that the constitution ot. the
United States, ex proprla vlrore, at once ex
tended over that Island; and that this extension
Part of the United States.
The constitution must be In force over a ter
ritory before the general Government can have
any authority to legislate respecting It. No
foreign sovereign can invest the general Gov
ernment with any legislative power.
The novel doctrine that the power of Congress
to govern territory ceded to the United States
may be conferred by a foreign sovereign by and
through the terms of the treaty ot cession, and
that the general Government can exercise
powers thus granted by a foreign sovereign in
dependent of and In disregard of the constitu
tion until Congress, mayhap In the future, shall
by Its enactment see fit to extend the constitu
tion over the territory. Is contrary to the hold-
Ing of the Supreme Court of the United States
to the effect that the general Government Is one
of the enumerated powers and can claim and
exercise no power not granted to It by the con
stitution, either expressly or by necessary im
plication. It Is clear that the general Govern
ment cannot legislate over territory where the
constitution from which Its very power is de
rived does not extend.
The power of the general Government to ac
quire additional territory rests upon Its consti
tutional power to make war. which may result
In conquest, and Its like power to make treaties,
which may brine territory by cession. The
power to govern such acquisition of territory
results from the power to admit States and
to make all needful rules and regulations re
ppectlnK the territory or other property belong
ing to the United States.
This clause authorizes Congress to legislate In
respect to a territory In local as well as na
tional matter before Its admission to statehood
In the Union.

potent To say that a' clause In the constitu
tion does not extend, to a territory, but does
limit the power of Congress In legislating for
that territory. 'Â» to draw j a distinction too
fine to be practical.
The argument, much repeated, that If the
national Government of the United States has
not the :>ower to deal with these new terri
tories untrammeled by the constitution. Its
power Is less than that possessed by the other
governments of the civilized world, is admitted.
It proves nothitw. The national Government ot
the United States fÂ« one of very limited pow

domain, and generallj*. except in respect to
Us power to <leal with foreign nations and

by the constitution. Its powers are much less
than that possessed by other governments. Xo

tion. Its powers can only be Increased by

of the constitution grave Congress, whese every
power must come, from that Instrument, the
authority to legislate In respect to that Island
as a part of the United States territory. It fol
lows that all the provisions of the constitution
In respect to personal and property rights, in
cluding the right to trial by jury In criminal
prosecutions, became at once, when the cession
was completed, a part of the supreme law of
the land. The character of an offense and the
nature of Its punishment would te determine-!
by the law li> force where and when the act
was committed, and laws of that character re
main In force after the cession until changed,
but the manner of trial must depend on the Jaw
in force when the trial Is had, even though the
establishment and organization of courts nnut
be awaited before the trial can be had.
The decision states that military law
being the solo authority the acts of a
military court were entirely legal and the
petition for a writ of habeas corpus was
denied.

Circuit Judge Lacombe's Decision
NEW YORK. May 7.â Judse Lacombe
of the United States Circuit Court to-day
overruled the demurrer entered In the
suit of Forney Betancourt of Matanzas,
Cuba. widow of Miguel Betancourt,
against a life Insurance company to re
cover $10,000 with interest on a policy is
sued by the association. ' In his opinion
Judge Lacombe says:
Â¦ The action is brought in the Federal court by
reason of diversity of citizenship. The demur
rer asserts that the court has no Jurisdiction
on the subject of action. The entire reliance of
the deniurrant appears to be upon the proposi
tion that there is not the diversity of citizen
ship which the statute requires by reason of the
fact th.it the plaintiff is a citizen of Cuba. It ts
contended that in some way or other the treaty
with Spain on December 10, 1838. did, from the
date of Its ratification, remove him from the
category of "foretfmers, citizens or subjects."
Uy thÂ« first article of the treaty between the
United States and Spain Spain relinquished all
claim of sovereignty over the title to Cuba. and.
as the Island ts. upon Its evacuation by Spain,
to be occupied by the United States, the United
States will, so long as such occupation shall
last, assume and discharge the obligations that
may under International law result from the
occupation for the protection of life and prop
erty.
There Is nothlry; In all the treaty which lends
color to the proposition that the plaintiff Is not
a forelen citizen. The political branch of thl3
Government hns found as a political fact that
the people of Cuba are "free and independent."

Modoza. further down the river. They informed Modoza that his Ruest was
a murderer and the three succeeded in tying Ozo with rope and delivered him

Ri.uwOOD CITY. May 7.â George Hill, a younp man employed as butler
at the Charles Crocker place at Burlingame, departed last Friday without
notica to his employer. It has since been ascertained that he took with
him between 5S000 and $3000 worth of Jewelry', including valuable diamonds.

ous places about the country and is well known there Is good prospect of

try to dispose of them. After a Ions search the detectives finally succeeded
in locating nearly all of the stolen property in a pawnshop in the tenderloin
. district.
The description given of the man who disposed of them tallies exactly
with that riven of Hill, the butler, who la accused of the robbery.

The legal end of the proceedings was

Louis P. Boardman. Mrs. Fennell's at

\ that It was based upon an alleged iigree

claimed, could not form the basis for a
valid order, and he therefore, in his
client's name, demanded its revocation.
Colcnel Marceau, Attorney Paterson and

stand and Identified the agreement offered
in evidence. Marceau said he had signed

and raised to the original rate of $5 SO,
was changed without the consent of the
Railroad Commission and was therefore
illegal and void. All three Commissioners
âPresident Edscn, Blackstock and Lau
meisterâwere unanimous in their opin
ion, which supports the contentions of the
plaintiff, John C. Moore.
This decision will have a far-reaching
effect upon all passenger traffic through
the San Joaquin Valley and will apply as
the result of a test case to all the rates
between San Francisco and valley points.
In 1S92 the Railroad Commissioners fixed
the rate between this city and Fresno at
$5 90. In order to meet the competition of
the Valley road the Southern Pacific re
duced their rates to San Joaquin Valley
points. The rate to Fresno was cut to
$3 <o In July, 1S98. and remained at that
figure until March of ine present year,
when It was raised to the old rate.
While it is privileged to reduce rates
without the sanction of the commission,
all elevation must first be subjected to
the consideration and must be approved
by the State board.
In their conclusion on the facts pre
sented the Commissioners find:
That circular withdrawing the said special
limited nrst-olass ticket between the city of
San Francisco ar.d the city of Fresno at the
rate of $3 75 was issued without the consent of
the Board of Railroad Commissioners of the
State of California. Said rate was withdrawn
without the consent of said board, and the con
sent of the said board has never been obtained
authorizing the defendants to withdraw the
said rate. >
That the fixing and establishing; of said rate
of $3 75 between the city of Fresno and the city
of San Francisco, ami the city of San Fran
cisco ami the city of Fresno, was for the pur
pose' of competing with the San Francisco and
San Joaquin Valley Railroad, and the estab
lishment of said rate and the sale of tickets
in pursuance thereof had the" effect and mil
divert to the all-rail line of the defendants the
greater portion of the travel between the said
cities re-rectlvely.
Conclusions of lawâ It follows from the fore
goinc findings aa a conclusion of law mat the
withdrawal of the rate of $3 75 established by
the defendants from the city of San Francisco
to the city of Frtsno, and from the city of ,
Fresno to the city of San Francisco, without .
the consent of the Board of Railroad Cominls- i
sloners of the State of California, is In viola- |
tlon of the provisions of section 20 of article
12 of the constitution of the State of Califor
nia. And we so flm'.
It is therefore ordered that the Attorney
General of the State of California be requested
to prepare an order to be iiromuleated by this
commission in accordance with and In pursu
ance with the findings and conclusions of law.
Attorney General Ford went to work
Immediately upon the decision of the
board and prepared an order for the Com
misisoners, clinching the matter in form
of a legal decree. The order was voted
upon by the Commissioners and signed.
The decree which will bind the railroad
either to restore the reduced rate or en
gage in protracted legal proceedings
reads:
Now, therefore, said findings and conclusions
and the premises considered. It is by the Board
of Railroad Commissioners of the State of Cali
fornia here now ordered, adjudged and decreed
that the action of said defendants, the South
ern Pae!flc Company, in lowering its rate for
the transportation of passengers between the
said City of San Francisco and the city of
Fresno was for the purpose of competing with
another common carrier within the State of
California, to wit., the San Francisco and San
Jofl.Qiiln Valley Railroad Company; that after
lowering its said rates and placing its tickets
on sale at said rate of $3 75, and issuing said
circular of July 18, 1S9S, fixing and establishing
said rate of |3 75. .and continuing the game in
force for the purpose nforenaid until and Includ
ing the 20th day of March. 1900, the action of
paid defendant, said Southern Pacific Company,
in Increasing its paid rates for passenger fare
between said cities from said standard, without
the consent of this board, was and ls in viola
tion of the provisions of section 22 of article
XII of the constitution of the State of Califor
nia, and was and is In violation of law, null
and void. .
And it Is further ordered, adjudsed and de
reed that the action of said defendant, ,the
Southern Pacific Company, a corporation. In so
raising its rates from said standard of J3 75 was
and Is illecal, null and void, and the same I*
hereby set p.Â«Ide. vacated and declared to be
null and void; and the said defendant, said
Southern Pacific Company, is ordered, com
manded and directed to restore said rate so es
tablished by It of $3 75 for one first-class pas
senger fare cne way between said cities of San
Francisco and Fresno. In the State of Califor
nia, and to Dlace on sale tickets of said rate of
$3 73, pood for such passenger fare between said
cities, and hereafter to keep such rates In force,
and provide and grant such rates of transporta
tion of !3 75 between said points; and the said
defendant is directed immediately to set aside
Its order and circular raising said rates, and to
restore and provide such rate of $3 75 for such
passenger fare between said points, at the same
rate and In thv same manner as the same ex
isted on and prior to the withdrawal thereof on
the 20th day of March, 1900.
The Southern Pacific Company does not
acknowledge itself without the field of
opposition to the action of the Railroad
Commissioners and the law department
will begin a course to offset the decree.
The decision in the Fresno rate case
raav or may not apply to all other rates
to San Joaquin points. To settle the en
tire question another case will be tried
soon. George M. Hurlburt. an attorney
In this city, filed a complaint against the
company yesterday in which the rates
from San Francisco to Fresno, Bakers
field. Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, San
Bernardino and San Diego were attacked
on the same ground as was relied upon in
the -Moore case. At the same time the
Southern Pacific undertook to re-estab
lish the Fresno rate fixed by the commis
sion in 1892 it attempted similar action as
to all the above mentioned points. The
old rates and the reductions in- 1S3S to
meet competition are as follows:
San Francisco to Fresno, $5 90â $3 75; to
Among the opinions handed down yrs
terday by the United States Circuit Court
of Appeals was one modifying the decree
of the Circuit Court in the suit brought
by the Fruit Cleaning Company against
the tresno Home Packing Company. The
suit was brought against the defendant
for infringing the patent on a raisin
cleaner and seeder.
The court found that partners may ac
quire legal title to personal property un
der a purchase mado In the firm name
and it Js not material whether such firm
is wholly fanciful or whether It contains
the name of one or more of the members
of the firm. The decree will be modified
ny striking therefrom so much as ad
judges that appellants have infringed
claim 1 of the patent and enjoins them
from further Infringement of that part.
As thus modified the decree ls affirmed.

New Crew of City Employes Selected
by the Board of Public
Works.
The Board of Public "Works selected
yesterday ten Individuals who recently
passed the civil service examination
for the position of sewer clean
ers. The ten men will draw a per
diem of 53 M as a pleasant result of hav
ing demonstrated their fitness for the
work of keeping the. sewers of a preat
city in good condition are Charles I. Ford,
James J. Flaherty, Charles Gardella, Tim
othy Creedon, Dave Sullivan, Michael
Quinn, Thomas E. Kenney, Henry J.
Daly, William J. Clare and James Mur
phy. â¢
All of the appointees were closely ques
tioned by Commissioner McCarthy regard-
Ing their knowledge of the proper way to
handle a sewer without gloves, and their
answers to the various difficult queries
proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that
they are "connoisseurs" in the art of
sewer manipulation. They were rewarded
by being put at the head of the Hat of
eligible?, and when the Board of Public
Works made a requisition for ten clean
ers they wore further rewarded by being
placed on the salary roll of the munici
pality.
They will start out on their labors this
morning, and It is thought that the re
sults of their scientific knowledge will be
recognized immediately. It Is believed
that their work will be so thoroughly well
done that the Board of Health will dis
continue the use of disinfectants in a mad
chase after the plague phantom. When
the sewers have succumbed to the mops
and brooms of the civil service cleaners'
brigade it will be possible for the dain
tiest society bud to hold court within the
subterranean recesses of the sewers of
this great metropolis. :â¢.

W. W. Miller After the Tanforan
People Because of a Queer
Bet.
Euit has been brou&r.t against the Tan
foran Racing Association by W. W. Miller
for the recovery of $25 which he claims is
due him on a winning bet of $5 which he
placed on Maydine on April 17 last.
Miller claims that he gave his $5 to
Frank McCluskey. one of the pool boys,
who disappeared with it and. returning
soon after, took a similar bet from Mrs.
Rose, wife of George Rose, the book
maker, to whom t he afterward returned
the ticket. Miller had been in the habit
of allowing the boys to keep the tickets
until after the race and bo he did not
ask for the coupon for his bet. After the
race had been run. the complaint alleges,
the boy went to Mrs. Rose and paid her
her winnings. $25 for $5 to one bet of Jo,
and then he told Miller he had not had a
chance to bet the $5 and so could only re
turn the money given him.
Miller demanded his bet, claiming that
bets made after his had been paid, and he
brought the matter before the officers of
the association. His claim was that they
were responsible for tne action of the
pool boy. He received no satisfaction In
that quarter and so he has brought suit
through his attorney. Arthur M. Currie.
for the amount he claims was paid the
pool boy and which he has not received.

explained that the law we* already on

dinance laapoees a license on all com

no moneys ehall be paid to any creditor
of the city where a counter claim against
the creditor exists. The Auditor and Fl

the company.

Brar.3enstein objected to a resolution
empowering the Mayor to expend $500 for

warrant the expense. He said he was
opposed to any patriotic extravagance

had expressed the view that the day
should be fittingly observed.
The Mayor returned without h!s ap
proval authorization for payment of

thirty-five days have not expired since

CIRCUIT COURT OF
APPEALS IN SESSION
Asks That the Board of Public "Works
Be Perpetually Enjoined From
Carrying Out Its Many
By virtue of authority vested by the
charter, San Francisco's Board of Public
Works has threatened to tear up the
tracks of the" Southern Pacific Company
from Seventh street to the county Una,
but for the present the proposed "drastic
measures 1 ' must be abandoned. Suit was
tiled yesterday by the company against
the Board of Public Works and its pres
ent members, Marsden Manson and
George H. Mendell, xo perpetually enjoin
the aefendants from proceeding to carry
their threat Into execution. J. E. Foulds
appears as attorney of record for the cor
poration, and associated with him as coun
sel are John Garber and Peter F. Dunne.
Tho petition is a ponderous document,
and in addition to the allegations of fact
and concluding prayer contains a com
plete history of the organization of the
Southern Pacific, all of its predecessors,
its lessor, the Southern Pacific Railroad
Company, branch lines and subor
dinate corporations. It also com
pletely covers the history of the
campaign and election that put the
present charter In operation and seated
the Board of Supervisors and the Board
of Public Works. Facts regarding dele
gations to the late municipal Democratic
convention being pledged to use every
effort to place candidates in nomination,
who, after election, would use equal effort
to "tear the rails out of the heart of the
Mission" are cited; the general Issues are
rounded into form, and then the com
plaint jumps to the line of fact on which
the Southern Pacific Company asserts
that the Board of Public Works or the
Board of Supervisors, not even the South
ern Pacific Company itself. It being the
lessee of the Southern Pacific .Railroad
Company, is vested with the authority to
tear up the tracks. /
On this point the complaint reads: "The
Southern Pacific Railroad Company and
its predecessors and its lessee, the South
ern Pacific Company, have for more than
thirty-five years continuously and unin
terruptedly operated its railroad upon the
route in question and have maintained
and kept the exclusive and peaceable pos-"
session of the railroad and the right of
way on and over which it is constructed
against all the world."
A copy of the petition for the writ of in
junction was served on the members of
the Board of Public Works, who are com
manded to appear before Judge Seawell
at a date to be set and show cause why a
perpetual writ should not issue as prayed.

McCarthy's resolution calling for a com
plete municipal telephone system was
passed to print. The proposals submitted
under this call should includo a complete
equipment for a central station and all
the sub-stations and all appliances neces
sary to make -.the proper installation to
serve 25,000 subscribers.
Section 2 â Any person, firm or corporation
violating any of the provisions of this ordl
nnnce shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor
and upon conviction thereof shall be subject
to a fine of 1500 or to imprisonment for 600
days or both.
Section Jâ No person, firm or corporation en
gaged In the business of supplying telephonic
service to the city of San Francisco or to the
Inhabitants thereof shall connect, maintain or
operate more than five telephone Instruments
upon any one party line.
McCarthy then Introduced an ordinance
limiting the number of telephones upon a
party line to five, which he thought might
remedy the defective service of the tele
phone company. The ordinance, which
was referred to the Â¦ License and Order
Committee, follows: â¢
McCarthy said he relied on the Integ
rity of the gentlemen who had made the
investigation. ' and he would not urge
the ordinance which he had introduced, as
from the report he believed that the modi
fication of the service was Impracticable,
at least at the present time.
The motion to Indefinitely postpone was
made by Connor after the report of
City Engineer Grunsky and Chief Elec
trician Hewitt, who had been directed to
investigate the feasibility of the plan laid
down by the measure, had been read. The
report stated that the examination hnrÂ»
been of necessity circumscribed, and could
not be complete unless the telephone com
pany would allow an inquiry into its
financial condition. It was thought that
any modification of the telephone ser
vice as suggested by the ordinance was
inexpedient. It would require 300 extra
operators and would cause more or less
annoyance to the party calling to wait
until the party called had been raised.- It
would lead to the abolition of the nickel
attachments, which the investigators held
to be a distinct benefit to the service.
The ordinance providing a penalty for
those renderine telephone service for fail
ure to make a switch after the. nickel has
been dropped was - indefinitely postponed
at yesterday's meeting of the Board of
Supervisors. The result of this action on
the part of the board will be that the tele
phone monopoly will continue its exasper
ating policy of exacting the nickel before
it has ascertained whether the party or
number called for responds.

For instance 6. 9, 7. 8 will count a run of
four, as the transposition of the. cards
makes the sequence.

Yale men were so jubilant over their victory in the
contests against the Californians .that they are sus
pected of setting fire to a building on the campus
for the purpose of making a bonfire; and if the sus
picion be well founded it will pay Yale to have her
boys licked next time as they deserve.
What is described as "a magnificent monument of
Thomas Jefferson" has just been from Ber
lin to Louisville. The sculptor 'is said to be an
American named Moses Ezekiel, so it is probable the
statue will have something of a prophetic cast o*
countenance and a judicial pose.
The civil war in Colombia has been conducted so
quietly that few people knew anything' about it, but
now that the insurgents are reported to have pur
chased a torpedo-boat perhaps there will be an ex
plosion very 'soon which will be heard round the
world.
The inability of the police to capture any of the
footpads who are terrorizing the city has a tendency
to suggest that the .worthy officers of the peace are
kept busy peeking through the wickets in the six
foot saloon partitions established by our "reformers."
A Sacramento lecturer, speaking in Oakland, said
that most municipal "governments are notoriously
corrupt. And our honored Mayor has only recently
received a prize for an essay telling how the truly
good can govern cities.
Having failed to accomplish any other result than
to make itself ridiculous with its bubonic plague
scare, the Board of Health has determined to inflict
another plague upon the city. It is raising its. salary
roll almost every week.
A local lecturer is convinced that if everybody had
his own way the march toward true freedom would
begin. That lecturer has evidently not been following
the antics- of his Honor the Mayor. ..'
SUFFICIENT justice has not yet been done to
the excellence of the display of American in
dustries at Paris in the reports from that city.
It is probable that this is due to the fact that the ex
position is not yet complete, and that later on, when
all the displays are open for contrast and comparison,
we shall hear more of the points in which our sp
periority is manifest. Up to this time the only no
table report on the subject has been the announcement
that in extent and variety the exhibits of the Unite!
States exceed tho<e of any other nation with the sole
exception of France itself. Few details of the ex
hibits have been forthcoming, but such as have been
presented give promise that when the whole is made
known we shall have the satisfaction of learning that
our display exceeds competition not only in number
and in variety but in quality as well.
One 1 of the features of the exhibit in which Califor
nians are mainly interested is that of fruit, and fortu
nately that is one of the branches in which the Ameri
can display is most comprehensive and most excel
lent. In the Eastern fruit-growing State3 much at
tention has been given to that exhibit, and it is grati
fying to note that rven.by those States the superior
quality of the California display is conceded.
The Philadelphia Inquirer in a recent editorial on
the subject said: "Every section of the country is
represented by an exhibit of some kind of fruit, but
it is the American apple that queens it over all rivals.
There is not a State having any importance as an
apple-grower that is not represented by at least 200
barrels of our product Pennsylvania has a remark
ably fine exhibit, and is perhaps second only to Cali
fornia in this respect, while Virginia. New York, In
diana and Connecticut ar<; also big exhibitors. Other
fruits are hot neglected, and, on the whole, we have
reason to be proud of the showing that we make."
If, as the Pennsylvania^ concede; we surpass other
OUR EXHIBITS AT PARIS.
United States District Attorney Frank L. Coomb3
has expressed the opinion that it will require "some
unseen wisdom" to govern the Philippines. Perhaps
the attitude of the United States District Attorney is
an indication that he thinks that the same kind of
wisdom is necessary to keep the Chinese out of San
Francisco.
BENEFACTIONS
OF A YEAR
Rossiter Johnson's compilation of public
gifts and bequests In the United States
which were made
Benefactions or became' opera

000,000. Two weeks later she transferred
valuable lands and water front rights,
swelling the endowment of the university
to $45,000,000. The face value of the se
curities constituting the bulk of the In

These depositors resent the suggestion of such a
cl.ange and will reject the party which threatens it.
Yet we are compelled to admit that even Republican
papers which arc now attempting to conclude na
tional issues in a State convention opposed and de
cried the gold standard law under which all of these
fcalendid results have appeared.
By July 1, iooc, it is probable that fully 250,000 0 {
our people will have money in the savings banks.
TheV earned and deposited it in gold dollars. They
want their principal and interest in gold dollars. They
know that if Colonel Bryan were elected and pro
cured the adoption of free silver it would not be in th<j
power of their trustees, the banks, to pay back in
gold, and for every gold dollar worth 100 cents they
earned arid deposited" they would get back a silver
dollar worth 50 cents.
We ask, with confidence, is there a reasonable man
in California who wishes to change this condition of
affairs? Ar.d with equal confidence we challenge any
mpporter 01 Colonel Bryan to deny that a change
will come with his election, if the fates should choose
to so afflict the country. . â¢%-'.-
The deposits in commercial and national banks -as
shown by Mr. Murphy underwent the same shrinking
process ar.d have in like manner risen. In 1893 they
declined over four millions, and stood at $46,000,000;
now they have risen to $86,943,858. National banks
fell off in 1893 to $13,000,000 and have now risen to
$37,000,000. Mr. Murphy said that the deposits in
our banks are now increasing at the rate of two and
a half millions a month! The banks are rapidly trans
ferring the money to give motion to wage and profit
paying enterprises, 3nd the surplus wages and profits
flow back into the banks to continue the stimulation
of enterprise.
Well, what has followed? Last Friday Hon. B. D.
Murphy of San Jose, Democrat, gentleman and Bank
Commissioner, delivered an address to the Bankers'
Association, in session at Sacramento. His statement
was both personal and official. It was a message of
progress and prosperity to the State. He submitted
statistics, derived from his official knowledge, which
tell the story of the jold standard in its application to
California. He read the deposit statement of the
banks of tlm State on July 1, from 1890. On
that ciatc the savings banks of California had
deposits amounting to Sy8.ooo.ooo. By 1893 those
had risen to $138,000,000. The decline then began,
and by June 1, 1S97, had reached $127,000,000. Then
the tide turned. Industry began to revive. The sur
plus earnings of the people began to flow into the
savings banks and thence into the channels of enter
prise, to pay more wages and make more surplus for
deposit, until January 1, 1000, our savings, banks had
in deposits $i5O.779.73i 62. belonging to 214,250 de
positors, being an average for each depositor of
$~O3 75. or the largest average deposit per capita of
any State in the Union.
It is interesting to note the eftect. Co'onel Bryan
anointed himself, put on the robes of the prophet
issued from contact with the oracles and predicted
pinch, pestilence and famine if the gold standard were
adopted. In his rec^r.t execution of an oratorical
quickstep in California he "made dust his paper and
with rainy eyes wrote sorrow on the bosom of the
earth" on account of what was to follow the gold stan
dard and the assurance of stability in our financial
policy.
I \EPUJBLICAX politicians who are so anxious to
Vâ/ diven public attention to their formulation of
new issues will do wel! to look rather more
closely at what is, ar.d find in current conditions the
vindication by events of the position of the party upon
veil seasoned issues. It was clear ever since 1897
th2t the Republican party during President Me Kin
ley's first term proposed to end all doubt by making
the single gold standard the law of the land. In
effect even- business transaction since March 4, 1897,
has been i:i this expectation. The business of the
country stepped out without feeling the way, confi
dent that the party would redeem its pledge.

PERSONAL MENTION.
arrested the boy for discharging firearms
within the city limits, and the case was
called yesterday before Judge Fritz. The
boy's mother created a scene In court by
denouncing the Mayor and all the city
officials for having her son arrested- She
had come from Australia five months ago.
The boy was convicted.
The Mission Federation has acted rightly in going
direct to the Mayor to demand the reforms desired.
It is true "that under the new charter we have given
the Mayor absolute and control over all de
partments." He is accountable, for the extravagance
and the waste of the administration and for the dark,
dirty, dangerous condition of the crime-infested
streets, and should not be permitted to shirk or evade
the issues his bungling has brought upon the com
munity.
The Mayor cannot shirk the responsibility rest
ing upon him. He has frequently boasted that
this is his government; that the charter gives
him power to control all branches of the gov
ernment; that the heads of departments are re
sponsible not to the people but to him, and that hi
only is responsible to the people. It is to him, there
fore, that the public must look for reform of admin
istration. It is his policy that has plunged the city
in darkness and that lias given criminals an opportu
nity to ply with safety the trade of robbery and assas
sination even in the best-ordered districts of the city.
While these repeated outrages of robbery, burglary
and attempts at murder go on following one another
with alarming rapidity and with increasing frequency
the Mayor continues to make a peacock display of his
power by interfering here and there with the various
departments of administrationâ not for the purpose of
improving matters but merely to show his authority.
Thus, at this juncture, instead of making any effort
toward lighting the streets or toward making the
police force more efficient, he is devoting all his fussy
energies to the end of converting the park lodge into
a branch library. He might just as well undertake to
use the lodge as an almshouse or an infirmary, for the
park area was not designed for library purposes any
more than for hospital uses.
The matter of which the federation complains at
this time is that of the revenues of the municipality
too large a portion is paid out for salaries and too
small a portion for permanent improvements. That,
of course, is a serious offense, and the Mission Feder
ation is doing an important service to the public in
directing attention to it. The greatest evil of the
time, however, is the neglect of the Mayor to provide
for the proper cleaning, sprinkling and lighting of the
streets. Out of that neglect there has come a positive
danger to life and property, for almost every night
some one is held up and robbed by footpads in the
darkness.
In the preamble to the resolutions calling for the
appointment of the committee the federation declares
"the taxpayers of the Mission and South Side districts
assisted Mayor Phelan to bring about the adoption of
the new charter and gave him the necessary votes to
change the then existing government in the belief
that a better condition of affairs would result from
such change, and the. waste and 'extravagance then ex
isting in the management of municipal affairs would
be stopped." Furthermore, the preamble declares
that the federation recognizes "that under the new
charter we have given the Mayor absolute power and
control over all departments." Therefore the federa
tion reasonably and justly looks to the Mayor for a
redress of the present administrative evils.
THE MAYOR'S RESPONSIBILITIES.
BY the Federation cf Mission Improvement Clubs
at a special meeting on Saturday evening there
was appointed a committee of five to wait on
his Honor Mayor James D. Phelan and ask him to
give such advice to the Finance Committee of the
Board of Supervisors to the end that a fair proportion
of the taxes contributed by the people of this city will
be expended on our schools, streets, sewers, and for
other permanent improvements, which have already
been too long deferred, instead of such enormous op
erating expenses as at present.
Leavenworth, Kans., has settled the "Sapho" con
troversy to the satisfaction of all parties. The au

rest from it one day in the week.

THE Republican party of California, and of other
States, was seriously handicapped in 1896 by the
formulation of national policies in State plat
forms. The policies which were put forward in that
way were concerning questions upon which the na
tional party had not spoken, and upon which there
was a division of opinion in the States. The only re
sult of State action in such cases is faction within the
party and serious division. In 1896 it resulted in the
highly spectacular secession of Teller, Dubois and
others, to whom it gave the opportunity to march out
of the national convention, investing their act with an
impressivencss out of proportion to its importance.
No Republican has forgotten the strain that was put
upon the party in this State by dogmatizing in the
State convention upon national issues. For a time it
imperiled the party, and doubt as to the result was
not fairly cleared away until the count of the vote was
completed.
This lesson should be heeded. The premature ex
pressions in the platform of 1808 are already being
used, we regret to say, by Republican papers to im
pugn the motives and impeach the good faith of Re
publican members of Congress, and from the same
source come ready-made planks on national issues
for the platform of the State convention. The party
is not a unit on the issues which these planks pro
pose to conclude. Nor is there any certainty that
their statement of issues will be indorsed by the na
tional convention. It is not for a State convention to
say that fifteen millions of Filipinos and Porto Ricans
; are citizens of the United States and free commoners
within the Union. Nor is it for such convention to
say that tropical labor and tropical wage shall have
free competition at present with American labor paid
on our high domestic schedule. The national conven
tion may say these things, but we doubt whether it
will, or should, go further than to indorse the efforts
of the administration to secure for the Government
and people full and reliable information as to these
new people and their physical environment, upon
which finally a permanent policy may be based as 10
our relations with the islands and the islanders. It
is' our belief that no good has ever been accomplished
by manipulating ex parte expressions in a State con
vention which affect policies that are essentially na
tional.
The Republican national platform of 1896 committe J
the party to a sound money policy. Its position on that
question was emphasized by the campaign and further
elucidated by State platforms which have since ex
pounded it. With that beginning the party has gone
forward to the successful accomplishment of gold
standard legislation, and has planted private prosper
ity upon the solid rock of the best public credit the
country has ever enjoyed. With our 2 per cent bonds
at a premium of 3 X A per cent, Republicans may view
with satisfaction the beneficial results of leaving a
national issue to a national convention, where it be
longs.
It this is true as to the money question, how much
more vital is the application of the same method to i
the amazing and vexatious results of the Spanish war!
As to them, the best that even a national convention
can do now is to lay down the very few fundamental
principles that may be needful of use as we progress
in knowledge of the situation, and beyond that leave
the issue in a waiting state, for it is better to wait for
light than go stumbling in the dark, with fatal results
to some of the parties in interest. The declaration of
the State convention of California, made August 24,
1898, was a step in the dark. No one then knew to
what extent the duties of the Government .growing
out of the Spanish war might lead us. And yet a very
few Republican papers, that wish to confuse rather
than enlighten counsel, insist that that premature
expression, that was prenatal even to the issue with
which it dealt, for that issue was not born until six
months later, shall be reaffirmed, enlarged and ap
plied to a situation to which it is already proven in
applicable.
The Republican convention of this State will help
the party by calling attention to its fidelity to past
promises, its redemption of every pledge, its success
ful leadership of the country through great trials, and
the advance made in material conditions by the ap
plication of its policies to the needs of the people.
The administration deserves not only the indorse
ment of the party, but of the people, and will have
both, and it will get an expression of the party's con
fidence in the management of intricate affairs yet to
be fully husked out and settled when they are en
tirely revealed, and not before.
The platform carpenters who wish to launch new
national politics in a State pond should be restrained.
They are like ship-builders who would construct the
Great Eastern on the shore of a fishpond.
NATIONAL POLICIES.
The benefits we are likely to derive from our ex
hibit are great. A considerable degree of prejudice
exists in Germany and France against American fruit,
and materially interferes with the advancement of our
fruit trade with those countries. That prejudice
will be weakened if not wholly overcome by the
effects of the object lessons of the exposition, and
throughout the civilized world there will be a widen
ing demand for the rich and luscious products of Cali
fornia orchards.
State* in the exhibits of apples, a fruit which occu
pies a comparatively small area of California orchards,
but is extensively cultivated in the East it is clear
that our superiority in the whole fruit display must be
so great as to distance all competition. Thus while
the United States surpasses other nations we will sur
pass all other States, and the pre-eminence of Califor
nia as a fruit-growing: country will be demonstrated
under conditions that will be of material advantage
to us.

Many ; Competitors for the Contract
Agree to Lower the Water Six
Hundred Feet
An important meeting of mining men
interested in the Comstock properties was
held in the Nevada building yesterday.
The business in hand was the opening of
bids for pumping out the mines so that
work may be resumed in the lower levels.
Twenty-six mining companies were rep
resented. Kastern and Western pumping
companies were present through their
representatives. The bids ranged from $75,
000 to $227,000. Several were so far from
the specifications that they were hardly
considered. The feature of the bidding
was the offer of the Risdon Iron Works,
which was to pump by an electric
hydraulic plant. The Snow Company's bid
was $227,000.
The work to be accomplished Is the
pumping out of 600 feet of water from the
mines and raising it so that it will run
through the Sutro tunnel. This will make
it possible for the mines .to be worked for
ten years at least in the lower levels. No
nctlon was taken on the bids. The con
tract will be awarded by a committee con
sisting of W. E. Sharon, G. McM. Ross,
Joseph R. Ryan and Lon Hamilton.

RECENT SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES.
Copyright, 190O, by Seymour Baton.
I few essential things which a successful
machine of this sort must accomplish, but
their accomplishment id not in every case*
altogether easy. The pictures must bo
presented so rapidly that there is no ap-
I preciable break between, either in light
I or in positions of the moving figures. The
! light must be admitted exactly as the
I picture is in place and must be cut off
j just before the picture Is i-hanged. The
I different pictures muat be shown in exact
register or there will be a shifting or
dancing effect which la not intended and
is unpleasant.
Instead 01 a number of separate cam
eras to take the pictures, a single instru
ment is used, so arranged that the shut
ter is In practically continuous vibration
at the rate of thirty or more exposure*
a second. In. Its proper place behind the
shutter and lens a continuous strip of
film is run in time with the shutter. Its
motion 'is necessarily jerky, for it must
be at rest for the exposure, while the
shutter is open, and move ahead ona
space while the shutter is closed. By
the development of this long strip of film
there is obtained a series of negatives,
from which positives are printed, in simi
lar long strips, and these positive strips
are used in the viewing or projecting in
strument. If the positives are examined
separately it will usually be difficult. If
not impossible, to detect any difference
in positions of the figures in pictures
which He near together in the strip, and
when these pictures are passed through
the projecting instrument at the same
rate as that of the taking camera the
movements of the figures upon the screen
appear natural and lifelike.
The projecting Instrument for moving
pictures is a regular projecting lantern,
with the addition of mechanism, attached
to- the objective, for keeping the shutter
and the pictures in motion. This mo
tion is kept up by a motor or by a hand
wheel, and the shutter or fan is run by
the same mechanism that moves the film.
A picture Is held against the opening
while the lens is uncovered, then released
as the vane covers the lens, and the next
one takes Its place, to be shown, in turn,
the instant the vane has passed.
Practical Uses.
The chief use to which moving pic
tures have' been applied thus far Is
that of entertainment, and unfortunately
the subjects which have aroused the most
interest have been prize-rights. There
are, however, many directions in which
this instrument may prove of great value.
It Is proposed to make use of It in war.
and how far such an idea can be carried
out we shall perhaps know better after
the close of the present war In Africa.
There are certain practical difficulties in
having a kinetoscope camera at the front
always ready for service, even If its us**
were permitted.
The value of a series of Instantaneous
photographs taken at short intervals in
analyzing rapid motion Is sufficiently ob
vious. By passing the pictures through
the viewing instrument at a reduced
speed the motion may be made as slow
as we wish and its nature clearly seen.
Another application of this principle
which has recently bfen proposed is less
obvious. It is proposed to take photo
graphs at long Intervals of movements
which are very slow. Then, passing the
series of_ pictures from these negatives
through the viewing Instrument at the
usual speed the slow motion becomes
rapid. Suppose, fcr example, that a pho
tograph is taken every few hours of a
sprouting seed and growing plant.. When
shown by the viewing or projecting In
strument the sprout may be seen break
ing through the ground, gaining in height
and size, putting forth leaves, buds ami
branches and reaching Its maturity, all
in ,a few minutes. The same method
may be applied to many things other
than plants. To this modification of the
principle of moving pictures it has been
considered necessary to give a new name
âthe "nhantoscoDe."
Moving Picture Machines.
All machines for showing moving pic
tures by whatever name they may be
called are nothing more than improve
ments and elaborations on the optical
principle of the zoetrope. There are but
The zoetrope consists of an open cylin
der, usually of cardboard, so mounted
that it can be whirled on a vertical axis.
In the upper half of this cylinder are cut
equidistant vertical slits. The pictures in,
order showing the successive instanta
neous positions In the motion to be repre
sented are placed inside the cylinder,
against the lower half, so that one picture
is opposite each slit. On whirling <the
cylinder, therefore, keeping the eye at
the row of silts, the pictures follow each
other in rapid succession, only e-ae being
seen at a time. The sensation of each
lasts until its image is replaced by that
of the next, and the impression Is that of
the action ot which the individual pictures
show different stages. â¢
The Zoetrope.
It would never have occurred to any
one before Muybrldge had come to this
country and had shown his Instantaneous
pictures of moving horses that any horse
ever assumed sucn attitudes. Even with
the evidence before their eyes the first
sensation of the majority 01 his hearers
was one of amusement and Incredulity.
His photographs were obtained by using
a series of cameras so placed that the
horse came before each one in succession
and caused the exposure to be made at the
right Instant by the breaking of a thread.
With the cameras at the right intervals
there was thus obtained a series of pic
tures which showed successive instanta
neous attitudes of the horse, with brief
breaks between. If these pictures could
be presented before the eye, one at a
time, in order and rapidly enough, the
impresslon of one would persist until the
next appeared and the horse would be
seen running, trotting or cantering natur
ally. Such an Instrument, very crude and
simple, existed at that time and had been
in use for many years as a scientific toy.
It was the zoetrope, the forerunner of the
kinetoscope and all its kin.
Muybridge's Pictures.
The response of the optic nerve and Its
connections to any action which produces
the sensation of light Is not instantane
ous nor does the sensation cease at once
with the cessation of the cause. It per
sists for an appreciable time, varying
from about one-thirtieth to one-tenth of
a second, according to the Intensity of the
light. In the case of the running horse,
therefore, the rapidly changing positions
blend into an impression whicn la pretty
well represented by the kind of picture
that was customary before the days of In
stantaneous photography.
Persistence of Vision.
If we look at one of the conventional
pictures of a running horseâ a picture
twenty years old, preferablyâ and com
pare it with some of the more recent pic
tures of the same subject we may see a
marked difference. In the older picture
the horse is stretched out in an attitude
which, to Jhe eye not specially trained,
suggests speed. In the more recent one
he may perhaps be seen standing like an
awkward statue on one leg, with no visi
ble means of support for the rest of him.
And yet this is. in a sense, true to life,
for it represents accurately the position of
the horse at one instant. Except to the
technically trained eye it conveys no im
pression of rapid motion, for the eye does
not see things that way.

the petitioners prayed a decree be entered
adjudging that henceforth the Income
from the trust property should be Invested

divided among the various lodges of the
city in accordance with the wish of the

Shaw filed suit last February for the pur
pose stated. Their petition was resisted
by many of the lodges, while others were
willing that the Income should be invested
in the stock. Judge Seawell decided yes
terday that as it had been proved that the
Investment was not a good one and that
the trustees were about to pay more for
the stock than It would bring in the mar
ket the petition should be denied.
Paul Strlckert has made oath that If
Martha Rachpauer is willing he will be
come a benedict. Thus has the strongest
allegation in the woman's breach of
promise suit been nullified. Some months
ago Miss Rachpauer filed suit against
Strickert, who is president of the supplies
firm that bears his name, to recover $50,
000 damages for breach of promise. She
told a pathetic story of a wrong done her
after years of waiting for her affianced
husband, and concluded her complaint
with the allegation that, although she
was ready, willing and anxious to marry
Paul Strickert, he had cast her aside.
Strickert gathered his lawyers around
him and the battle began. For a time
technicalities of law .held the case from
the trial court, but now, as Strickert has
filed answer, Issues have been Joined and
in event Miss l.achpauer does not take
him at his won and become his bride the
world will hear the story of their love
making and parting quarrel from Ihe lips
of both.
As an introductory to his answer Strick
ert admits that at one time he proposed
to Miss Rachpauer and they became en
gaged. Not since October if of last year,
he says, has his once fiancee been willing
to marry him and she has refused his offer
of marriage. In proof of his assertion or
to at least prove the fact that she released
him from his contract, he quotes an
agreement she execu.ed at a recent date.
This agreement, stripped of legal verbi
age, reads:
"Know all men by these presents: That
I, Martha Rachpauer, unmarried, for and
in consideration of the sum of $10 to me
in hand paid by Paul Strickert. have re
leased for myself, heirs, executors or ad
ministrators, of and from all manner of
actions and do forever discharge Paul
Strickert from all actions or causes of ac
: ',on In law or in equity which against him
1 ever had from the beginning of the
world to the present day. Also, I further
disclaim any and all relationship to him
In any and every kind whatsoever, by and
through our former relationship hereto
fore existing."
Notwithstanding this agreement Strick
ert says in his answer: "I am now ready
and willing to marry the plaintiff and
hereby and now make offer to so marry
her."

PAUL STRICKERT
SAYS HE IS NOW
READY TO MARRY
The ship Cyrus TVakefleld appeared off
port yesterday with her main royal mast
and foretop gallant mast carried away.
She Is thirty-two days from Honolulu.
About the same time the sloop Iroquois,
133 days from New York, appeared in the
offing with her foretop gallant mast miss
ing, and the reinsurance brokers at once
commenced to make rapid calculations on
ships long at sea and overdue that might
have been mixed up in the same storm
with the partially dismantled vessels out
side.
The Iroquois was towed in about sun
down, however, and Captain Thompson
had scon told his story. He lost his fore
top gallant mast in a south-southwest
gale oft the Horn on February 20. He had
bad luck from the start. Three days after
leaving New York he had his fore lower
topsail yard and mizzentopsail yard car-,
ried away in a northwest gale. Except
for a bit of a gale off the Horn the re
mainder of the voyage was fairly good.
The Cyrus WakÂ»fleld refused a tow and
tried to beat in, but the wind was too
light and contrary and at sundown she
anchored ten miles outside. It is likely,
however, that she got Into the same gale
with the Antiope, which arrived here yes
terday from Kihel. Ha>vaii. The Antiope
reports having encountered a northerly
gale on March 1" in latitude 29.52 north,
longitude 147.40 west, which Increased al
most to a hurricane. The Antiope was
hove-to. It was impossiole. says Captain
Murray in his report, to face the wind
and the lee side was all under. All sails
furled were mere or less blown out of the
gaskets and much other damage was done.
Collector Cleared Thyra.
It is an unusual thing for the Collector
of the Port to clear a vessel ready for sea,
but Collector of Customs Jackson has es
tablished a precedent for the business.
The California and Oriental liner Thyra
arrived here on Saturday with a small
cargo of freight and the agents desired to
get her away as soon as possible. An ac
commodating deputy waited at the Cus
tom-house until after 2 o'clock on Satur
day afternoon to clear the vessel when
she was ready, but as she had not finished
discharging by that timfe he left the office.
Late on Saturday the steamer was
ready for sea, but no deputy could be
found. On Sunday morning Collector
Jackson was appealed to. Without hesi
tation he got into the cab provided for
him and proceeded to the Custom-house,
where he made out the necessary papers
and attached his own signature to them.
Such an honor has not been accorded a
vessel entering this port, it is said, In
many years.

NEW TORK. May 7.â There were several
points of Tveakr.ers in the etock market to-day
end thâ¬Â«Â» were ru!3cient to turn the room
trfcder* to the bear side of the market. The
cpejations of this professional element were
the only ones apparent outside of a few stocks
end they reflected no conditions or even well
established opinions regarding the general out
look. The demand for stocks continued quite
irjs'.cniflcax.t. so that the moderate offerings
In l&rge part for the ehort account of room
traders made an impression easily upon prices,
but the decline failed to Induce any liquidation
and prices readily rallied when the bears came
to cover. The tteel shares were the most con
eplcuoun in the trading and were weak from
the opening. The reported dosing of a mill
of the Federal Steel Company Induced the early
decline. T.hkh was languid and sluggish. The
announcement of the resignation from the
board of directors of the American Steel and
Wire Company of the Seiigman representative
and their statement of irreconcilable objections
to Mr. Gates and his policy caused a sharp
further break in the steel group, in which
Federal Reel was rather more affected than
Etet.1 and Wire. Pressed Steel Car and Amer
ican Smelting were exceptions in the rroup.
?h* former rising over a point. Long Island
broke charply after Its recent .notable advance
on the absorption by Pennsylvania and c-lcs?d
*'* points lower. The bonds of the company
were also heavy. The reaction was attributed
to speculative profit-taking and occurred on
comparatively small dealings. In the rallrcad
!1Â« r-t. Paul. Pennsylvania. Union Pacific and
Baltimore and Ohio had rather a wide fall on
what looked like letting go of a ej>e<~ulaUve ac
count. There were heavy blocks offered of all
these. There was a Blight Â«how of strength in
rpot at the opening, response to London's en
courareraent over South African news, but
.the rise was but momentary. The rally after
the break in the Ft eel stocks r. ai not well
held. General electric advanced nearly S
joints in the morning, but Â«aved only 1 point
on tbe day. The money market continued very

CHICAGO. May 7.â Considering the bearish
tenor of the foreign news, wheat showed con
siderable independence early, and during the
session this spirit was buoyed up by domestic
news of another sort. Cables were lower,
world's shipments heavy, Russian shipments
increasing l,000,OÂ» bushels for the week, and
there was a email increase on passage. Against
these were the Ohio State report making the
croo condition of that State 41 per cent, an
assertion that the Kansas wheat waÂ« turning
yellow from too much rain and a decrease in
the visible of 2,647.000 bushels. The ranze or
prices was narrow. A feature was the de
mand for July at 67c. Several times the mar
ket touched that figure, but on each occasion
the demand exceeded the supply and slight
recoveries followed. The May-July spread at
the close was 14c July closed He down.
The corn market was dull and prices were
steady. The close was slightly lower, July
closing 'ic lower at 39',4Â£39Hc. At the close
the May-July difference was "ic. There was
considerable selling by bull houses.
Oats were easy, influenced by corn, July clos
ing U@Hc down.
Provisions were weak. The hog market was
depressed, and long stuff In scattered amounts
pressed against the market, meeting almost no
support. From the bottom there was a little
recovery on buying by packers, but this was on
a small scale and the end of the session found
the market weak. July pork closed 174c under;
lard lost u^T.^c and ribs closed 10&124C down.
The leading futures ranged as follows:

"The fluctuations of the past thirty days
have been narrow everywhere, with trade con
ditions dull and uninteresting in all markets,
especially so with relation to Mild Coffees.
Here the demand has been of hand-to-mouth
character, with occasional days of good busi
ness, either under buying orders or forced of
ferings by holders. Such modifications as aro
to be noted in our quotations follow the sales
made in the latter way, but point to no par
ticular change in the general situation. An
exception to this can be made In favor of un
washed Salvadors. which have hardened a little
under conditions purely local, perhaps pros
pective rather than Immediate, but at the same
time in no wise unwarranted by the position
of this particular \arlety here and in foreign

SAUSALITO. May 7.â "I tell you this ia

.actly the feeling of the water front at
the reopening of the poolrooms, and the
peneral awakening of Sausallto. All day
long the boats have brought crowds of

the feminine element is conspicuous by its
absence. "They don't tumble that the

Sppcial Dispatch to The Call
Late this afternoon Neely obtained tho
required $20,000 ball and was released. A.
C. Smith, a friend of Neely, said that
Neely had been for fifteen months In the
postal service In Cuba, and during 'that
time he had handled millions of dollars.
The. shortage In Neely's accounts, he said,
was doubtless due to clerical errors and
that they would be straightened at the
proper time. Smith also said that Neely
while In Cuba had been concerned in sev
eral speculations and that his last enter
prise was in the shipment of a cargo of
cocoanuts.

Notwithstanding these great improvements
In preaching and practice In our day it can
not be denied that the Christian life which
fin^s rxpreeslcn In the actions of everyday life
dots not to the name extent manife5t itp^lf
in a high discriminating and pure Christian
morality. No thoughtful observer of our com
mercial, political and Â»oclal life can fail to
be struck wth the d^sree to which professedly
and seemingly Christian men fall to carry out
the moralities of the cospel in their daily
transaction* in the world. So marked la this
feature of the time's that it presents itself as
a problem difficult to solve. What is there. If
there be anything. In our methods of preach
ing, teaching, admlnl.Â«terlng and living v/hlch
leads to or iK>lnts the way to these deplorable
results. I rrake no attempt to explain the
problem; I only venture to suggest that the
failure of thÂ« jmlpit sufficiently to teach and
Â«*mphasize the ethical Ride of r the gospel may
be one of the many causes which might be
ctatc-d es having contributed to produce the lax
principle, a practice which now so frightfully
prevails.
I now reach the question whether the pulpit
of to-day is doing Its full dutv In the way of

For a lor.g time the your.g man was em
ployed as a driver for the Contra Costa
Laundry, owned by Pliney Bartlett, his
uncle. He lost his "position recently, and
being unsuccessful in securing other em
ployment became despondent.
On the day he was last seen a friend of

In which he declared that he "was going
to end it all." At noon of that day Bart
lett joined his uncle at the ferry, and dur
ing the trip across the bay 'pleaded with
fcis relative f&r reinstatement in his for
mer position. The elder Bartlett was ob
durate, however, told his nephew that he
was net wanted and that there were no
positions vacant which he could fill.
When the stearner had reached a point

turned and said good-by to a number of
persons who were standing near him. Be

Fight. A boat was lowered from the
Eteamer and a search was made for the
suicide, but no trace of him could be
found. â¢
Deceased was a native of Oakland and
Â£3 years of apf.
The suicide was witneesed by a gentle

ger en the steamer. Fairchild was close
enough to the man to ytt a good view of
his features. Just aa the young man
leaped frcm the rail into the bay his hat
blew oil and fell on the deck of the
steamer. Kalrchild secured the hat and a
few days later brought It to Bartlett's
relatives, who immediately Identified it as
one worn by the missing man. A picture
of young Bartlett was shown to Fairchild
and without hesitation he declared that
the suicide wr.s Bartlett.

be classed as a light opera. One num
ber particularly, "By Your Side." will
prove exceptionally popular. Taken all
in all it was ix bright, crispy performance,
although Mr. Kdward Kerr could be im
proved upon. The entertainment appeals
strongly to the children and the Satur
day matinee- should tind them out in force.
It is not necessary for any one who is
looking for a hearty laugh to advertise
for it. It can be found at the Columbia
Theater In the play, "The Evil Eye."
Those who can remember the old-style
pantomimes will recognize the article,
only we call it horseplay In these days.
However, it is strung together so cleverly
and the action is so rapid that there Is no
time to get that tired feeling.
Of the uf ty oad people who compose the
company Al H. \\ lison is easily the star.
His bright, magnetic, easy manner made
him a welcome feature of tho perform
ance from his lirst entrance. His specialty
is German dialect monologue anu is one
of the beÂ»t ever heard in this city. Mr.
Wilson is closely followed by Rosaire and
Elliott, two exceedingly clever gymnasts
and pantomimisis. Their acrobatic work in
troduced many dexterous feats which, to
a certain extent, are new here. A feature
of the encertainment is the octet of the
clever Phaaey Troupe, whose signing of
negro melodies and wild, abandon danc
ing, as well as their drum manipulations,
aToused the enthusiasm of the audience.
Melodrama Packs the Alcazar â Tivoli
Prospers With "The Wizard of
the Nile"â California Pre
sents a Gem.
"The Evil Eye" Is Horse-
Play, but Is Funny to
a Finish.

Promoters of the "American School
ACCUSED OF USING
MAILS TO DEFRAUD
of Magnetic Healing" in
Trouble.
KANSAS CITY. May 7.â S. A. Weltmer.
president, and Joseph H. Kelly, secretary,
of the "American School of Magnetic
Healing" at Nevada. Mo., were brought
Into the United States District Court here
to-day to answer a charge of using the
mails for thft purpose of fraud. They
a*kcd for a trial at an early date.
The last Federal Grand Jury in Kansas
City found an indictment against the of
ficers of the school, charging that Welt
mer, while advertising to cure disease by
"absent treatment" and bring "success in
iife," did not give an equivalent value to
the patient for the money paid. The mail
of the school has been enormous, and last
week It was held up by the Washington
postofnee officials, who orderet* Weltmer
to show cause why his matter should not
be barred from the mails under the fraud
order.

SANTA ROSA. May ".âBy the terms of
arrangements completed to-day Thomas
Hopper, the well-known capitalist, dis
poses of all his holding.-; in the Santa
Rosa Bank and will soon retire from the
presidency. For years Mr. Hopper has
held the controlling interest in the insti

KANSAS CITT, May 7.â A three-story
brick building at 1302 Grand avenue, in
the â¢ business center, occupied on the
ground floor by*- Jacob Goodman as a
second-hand . store, and above by Mrs.
Alary Sohn as a rooming house, col
lapsed at 4:20 o'clock this afternoon, bury
ing seven persons In the rvflns. It is be
lieved none of the injured will die. John
W. Moore, aged 70, former Mayor of
Kansas City, was the most aeri
ously hurt. The building, which
was ancient, had been condemned
several months ago, and recently
had ' been weakened by workmen .exca
vating for a new building on the adjoin
ing lot. The building collapsed almost
without warning, the walls bulging out
and the roof crashing In before any of
the inmates could make a move to es
cape. The wreck was complete. The ruins
were soon covered by a swarm of fire
men digging for the buried ones.
Goodman, his wife, two daughters and
W. Kline, father of Mrs. Goodman, lived
in the rear of the second floor. Annie
Goodman, 15 years old, was sick In bed.
Soon after the crash Mrs. Goodman, cov
ered with mortar and dust, crawled from
beneath one of the floors. She was un
hurt, save a few bruises, and cried to be
allowed to return and look for her chll-;
dren.
John "W". Moore, former Mayor of Kan
sas City and a member of the Board of
Trade, was taken out of the wreck un
conscious. Ho evidently had been in a
room on the second -floor, and when lo-
CRted was burled ten feet under brick,
mortar and broken furniture. It was
twenty miutes before the nremen could
chop their way to him. He was removed
limp and unconscious and hurried to the
hospital. There it was later reported
that his injuries, while serious, were not
necessarily fatal, and it was believed he
would recover. Owing to his advanced
age, however, he may not survive the
shock.
Anna Goodman was found buried ten
feet beneath the debris and was rescued
by her father, who had escaped with
slight injuries. Her injuries consisted of
severe bruises. Fannie Goodman, ased
8, was rescued soon after the buildlne
collapsed. She was severely bruised, w.
Kline was taken from the ruins badly
hurt, but suffering no broken bones, and
v.-as able to walk away. Mls3 Mary
Sohn was found beneath a pile of debris
and was rescued by the firemen. She
was badly bruised and hysterical, but Is
thought to be not seriously hurt. The
building was valued at but $10,000.

chase of Sequoia Lands by the
Government.
A lecture was given last night by
Cloudsley Rutter before the California
Academy of Sciences on "The Natural
History of the Sacramento Salmon." The
speaker dwelt at length on the customs
of the game fish and told of the long dis
tance traversed and the difficulties en
countered by the salmon in reaching- its
spawning place.
The following resolution was adopted by
the society:
Whereas, Many of the citizens of Santa Cruz
Santa tiara ami San Mateo counties and of
the city of San Francisco have urged the es
tablishing of a forÂ»>Et park to cover the "big
liaeln" and the conticuous redwood forests In
the Santa Cruz Mountain?: and whereas, such a
park would secure. If once In the hands of the
United RtÂ»tesÂ« Government, a large body of
primeval forest of Sequoia seniDervlrens as a
l'crmanent possession for the whole of the peo
ple. This is of special interest to every man
of science, as the time in approaching when
every crimeval redwood â¢ north of San Fran
cisco will be felled by the' lumbermen. And
whereac, truch a purchase will also secure for
the use of the whole people of the peninsula
extending Â« from Santa. Cruz to San Fianeisco
the use of the mountain waters collected by this
forest arra. <
Resolved, therefore, . That the California
Academy of Sciences' cordially support* the
efforts of the Committee on Ways and Means
recommendlnK an appropriation to secure the
eejrresratlon of the above named territory as a
natural forest park.

During the Spanish-American war he
was a guest at the Hotel de la Poste,
Geneva, Switzerland. Among the other
guests were several German army officers
and one Spanish Government official.
The "Immortalization of Bates" among
Americans In Europe occurred at the
table d'hole dinner one evening. The
Spanish official was seated at Bates' left.
A German officer asked him what he
thought of the war.
"The most brutal nraault," said the
Spaniard, "In the history of the world."
Continuing he said: "The lowest common
street laborer in Spain is so much more of
a gentleman than the average Wall-street
millionaire who" rides ? to . his offlce In * liv
eried equipage that the Spanish laborer
would lose caste by even talking to- the
Yankee dollar king. In fact, all Ameri
cans are 'pigs.' "
At this Bates joined In the conversation.
"Excuse me, sir," he said: "this -is a
public dining-room. I am an American
and would ask you to change either your
style of criticism or your topic of con
versation.".
The don glared at him. ."I have seen you
around the hotel, sir, but was not aware
'you were an American." That: is not ; my
fault, however, and I take the liberty 'of
reiterating everything I -' said^ about the
war and your countrymen." .
It took tho German officers and half a
grinding yesterday, and United States
Commissioner Heacock declared that he
wished to voice his solemn protest against
the action taken by Collector of the Port
Jackson. The Commissioner insists that
each coolie claiming to h" a "native son"
should be examined Immediately upon his
arrival, so that when he presents himself
in court demanding a landing the courts
may have something upon which to in
volve him in the contradictions which
necessarily will follow from manufactured
testimony. As it is now the yellow "na
tive sons" are sent to the County Jail and
are there coached to tell the lies which
land them .is citizen voters of the United
States. And finally. If Collector Jackson
believes this not to be true The Call still
stands ready to prove every charge which
It has made if he will either permit or de
mand an investigation of the Chinese traf
fic under his administration.
Ono of the alleged native-born Chinese
whom Collector Jackson had refused to
examine or pass upon came up for ex
amination yesterday before United States
Court Commissioner Heacock. Because of
the fact that the Chinaman had been
coached in the County Jail and had an
opportunity' to compare his statement
with those of the witnesses provided for
him by his owner he made a good case,
and the Commissioner was obliged to rec
ommend to Judge de Haven that he be
allowed to land as an American citizen.
Heretofore it has been the custom for
a Chinese Inspector from the Chinese
Bureau to board . tfjre incoming steamer
and take down, the statement of the Chi
nese passengers. Whenever any alleged
native-born was refused a landing by the
Collector upon the findings of the bureau
the Immigrant was obliged to petition for
a writ of habeas corpus. The transcript
of the shorthand notes of his statement
was a . club whereby perjury was often
defeated and the' landing denied. But
when Collector Jackson announced that
he would not handle native-born cases
at all he opened a very wide door for the
wholesale admission of coolie laborers
falsely claiming to be American citizens.
United States Commissioner Heacock
said yesterday to a reporter: . "I desire
to enter ray solemn protest against this
condition of affairs. Up to the time that
the examination on shipboard of alleged
native-born was abolished by the Col
lector, the statement made by the im
migrant on board the steamer, before he
had time or opportunity to correspond
with his friends on shore was a great pro
tection to the people of the United States
against the admission of coolie laborers
under the guise of Americans. Now that
protection has been taken away and we
have absolutely nothing on which to base
an effective cross-examination of the Im
migrant or his witnesses. Such a condi
tion; of affairs should not be tolerated.
Every alleged native-born should be ex
amined immediately upon arrival by the
Chinese Bureau in the presence of no one
bat the official stenographer of the bu
reau. Unles3 this is done every alleged
native-born will have an opportuntiy of
landing with impunity. It is only when
they are examined Immediately upon
their arival that the courts have any op
portunity Â¦whatever to detect and to frus
trnte conspiracy."
The Secretary of the Treasury ' has di
rected Collector Jaokson to detail an In
spector from the Chinese Bureau to at
tend to the making out of papers for Chi
nese merchants domiciled in this country
who are on the eve of departing for
China with the intention of returning.
They will have these papers on their re
turn to this country to facilitate their*
landing. .
g-ir-3ITE expected has happened. In re
fusing to consider coolie "native son"
II cases Collector Jackson has done ab
solutely nothing to reform the out
rageous traffic which Is being conducted
under his administration at this port. On
the contrary, he has encouraged and as
sisted the frauds which are being perpe
trated in this city. When The Call made
its expose of this gigantic trade in Chi
nese "citizens" and laid bare the opera
tions of the local ring which has made
thousands upon thousands of dollars of
ill-gotten profits this paper suggested and
urged upon Collector Jackson the only
practicable and honorable remedy which
could be supplied to prevent the gross vio
lations of the exclusion act.
This remedy as The Call presented it
was for Collector of the Port Jackson to
dUcuss and consider the cases of all Chi
nese landing a.t this port, take the evi
dence presented by each a.nd then remand
the Chinese "native sons" to the custody
of the courts, where their claims could
be openly.' legally and orderly investigated
by due process of lav.-. Collector Jackson
declined to do this and the expected re
sult has come.
United States Commissioner Heacock
declares that through the ruling of Col
lector Jackson not to consider "native
son" cases it is absolutely impossible to
prevent perjury, and that the laws of the
United States shall be cheated and that
through manufactured testimony and no
torious coaching questions and answers
coolie "native eons" will be created as be
fore. When The Call exposed this out
rageous, criminal violation of the exclu
sion act this paper made it very plain that
if Collector Jackson wished faithfully to
perform his duty and to kill the ring
which has been feeding in luxury at the
expense of the people of this State he
would take up every case.
As a matter of fact he cannot by any
subterfuge avoid this policy, as no "na
tive eon" Is known as such until he claims
to be one to an inspector of the Chinese
Bureau, which is under the absolute con
trol and Jurisdiction of Collector Jackson.
When the coolies land at this port all of
them come consigned to San Francisco,
according to the sworn statement of the
master of the ship upon which they come
its Chinese. It is not until an inspector of
the Chinese BTrreau begins his examina
tion that any Chinese, through the magic
of corruption, becomes a "native son" of
California. .
From the very beginning, therefore, of
the traffic Collector Jackson has authority
over everj' case and it is simply through
his absurd position that he relieves him
self from the consideration of them all.
If he be sincere, therefore, he will adopt
the only honest policy which Is open to
an honest official. He recognizes, by au
thority of his own admission, that the
grossest frauds have been perpetrated in
the landing of Chinese "native sons."
The expose made by The Call has proved
his ' admissions. He has. therefore, but
one course to pursue, and that Is to ac
cent the classification of Chinese made by
the inspectors of the Chinese Bureau and
then remand the alleged "native sons '
int " the custody of the United States

ADMITS COOLIES
An Immediate Enforcement of the Exclusion Act

Citizens in Mass-Meeting Ask Pro
tection From the Influx of
Asiatic Hordes.
Â«T? N'DER the direction of the united
Uj l.ibcr organizations of this city
1 a:i enthusiastic and largely at
tended mass-meeting was held last
jiig-ht in Metropolitan Hall to protest
apaln^t the violation of the Chinese ex
clusion act at this port and the alarming
influx of Japanese laborers. Resolutions
denouncing the traffic and calling upon
Congress to afford Immediate relief were
presented and unanimously adopted oy
the audience. The speakers, who pre
st nted the twin evils in their various
phases, represented every class in the
community. Officials; merchants, me
chanics, lawyers and economists sub
mitted the startling facts of the present I
Asiatic invasion at this port and pointed
out in solemn warning: the dire conse
quences which will follow, not only to the
people cf this city ar.d State but to the
people of the United States.
The t^pose^made by The Call of the
viola ticiucf the exclusion act and of the
manufacture of coolSe "native son cltl-
E'-n.s" iuriiifched a theme upon which the
?}>* alters dwelt at length to denounce the
traffic and demand that it be suppressed
by the proper authorities. The facts of
daily occurrence, which mark the coming:
of thousands of Japanese, supplied an
other subject for earnest attention and
til Â«-n J.11C demand that the Government
Â«jf tr.v.- t. iiued States take immediate
measures to suppress the evil which' has
grown to mammoth proportions.
In a ftw words W. Mac Arthur, the presi
dent of the evening, outlined the purposes
of the mi-eting, declaring them to be a
protest against the influx of Japanese la
kur, which has assumed the alarming pro
portions of an invasion. While we are go
ing to the Philippines, he said, to assimi
late the natives there the Japanese and
ITliTWT are coming here to assimilate us.
It was to voice a protect against this
menace that the meeting was called, and
it was fitting that the meeting should be
}uld under the direction of organized la
bor. He begged his hearers to believe,
however, that no class, creed or politics
dominated on the platform.
All classes, be declared, were repre
sented. All political creeds had repre
sentation. It was a meeting of Americans
called together to protest against a coolie
invasion and to prevent American com
munities from being Orientalized. The
time- is ripe tor action, and any delay is
dangerous. Those, therefore,, that do not
wish to *>irk to the level of the Chinese
and Japanese must arouse themselves for
defense. The Chinese and Japanese pos
sess many advantages as workmen, he
raid, and they cannot bt tolerated among
us except mm a menace to men of ail
classes and conditions.
â¢ The speaker then read letters from Con
gressmen Marion de Vries and J. W.
Needham and United States Senator
Perkins. Congressmen de Vries and Need
ham expressed themselves emphatically
in opposition to the further immigration
of Japanese and in favor of the enactment i
of laws to prevent it at once. They re
ferred to interviews published In The Call
es indicating their r osition. Senator Per
kins declared that he was opposed to the '
further immigration of Japanese, but he
declared that nothing other than a rigid
enforcement of the immigration laws can
be done until the treaty with Japan is
modified.
The speaker then read a series of reso
lutions addressed to the P^epresentativea
of California in Congress. These resolu
lions were unanimously and enthusias
tically a/Jopted by the audience later !n
The evening:. The resolutions axe those
given above.
The first regular speaker of the evening
was then announced as C. L. Dam, who
rpoke long and eloquently en the local sit
uation regarding the Influx of Chinese
and Japanese laborers. He discussed
cimply the local phases of the eviL He
called attention to the fact that an aver
age of 8>XK) Japanese are entering San
Francisco every year. The number is
gradually increasing. The trades are be
ing Invaded. Cheap labor is being intro
duced an<1 Inevitably the standard- of
American life and civilization Is being de
graded.
"Between two thousand a'n'l three thou
sand Chinee 'native son' voters are
among us," he fiaid. "They were made
on the Pacific Mail dock and I am told
that if they were to demand the exercise
of their ripht to vote they would control
the balance of political power in this

"They. too. will demand the right to

WHEBEAS, It has become apparent that strenuous efforts are
being made with, the object of removing all barriers to the
free entry into the United States of Chinese upon ths expira
tion of the Chinese Exclusion act; and,
Whereas, Our expansion dictates that not only should the pol
icy of exclusion be continued, but it should be extended so as to em
brace the Japanese and to obviate the Ehortcomings of all previous
efforts in this direction by which the laws have been larg-ely nulli
fied; therefore, be it
Hesnlved, By ths citizens of San Francisco, in mass meeting as
sembled this seventh day of May, 1900, that wa urge upon Con
gress to re-enact the Chinese exclusion act, with such additions as
may be necessary to make it fully effective for the protection of
American labor; and, be it further
Resolved, That we also urge the adoption of an act of Con
gress or the adoption of such other measures as may hz necessary
for the tctal exclusion of all classes of Japanese other than mem
bers of the diplomatic staff. Such a law has become a necessity not
only on the grounds set forth in- the policy of Chinese exclusion,
but because of additional reasons resting in the fact that the as
s-imed virtue of the Japanese, i. e., their partial adoption of Ameri
can customs, makes them the more dangerous as competitors; and
be it further
Kesolved, That a copy of these resolutions be forwarded to the
Representatives and Senators of California, with a request for their
immediate action thereon.

nativity and citizenship.
"This problem is not a local one. It is
not a labor problem. It la an American
question and Congress should so consider
< J Lhlnese ar <" now coming: into this city
without warrant. They are coming in
overland and underground. The Japa
nese are coming Jn the same way and will
demand the right of suffrage which the
others already claim. We cannot assim
ilate with these people. We cannot tol
erate them and we should insist from
Congress on immediate relief in legisla
tion. One of our representatives in Con
gress says that we cannot do anything?
because of the existence of a treaty with
Japan. In this respect our representative
in Congress is altogether mistaken. Con
gress always reserves the right to abro
gate a treaty. It can 60 so now with
Japan.
"If there be one thins that the people
of California have done worthy of the
commendation of the nation it is that Cal
ifornia forced Congress to adopt the ex
clusion act and protected the United
totates from the dreadful effects of Ori
ental social, moral, commercial and Intel
lectual ideals. California owes it ag-ain
to the people of the nation to insist upon
the enforcement of the Chinese exclusion
act and to demand the enactment of an
exclusion act against the Japanese.
"These Asiatic laborers will undermine
our civilization and we will repeat the
terrible experience of Rome. Already
thousands of them are in our fields dis
placing American workmen. They are in
the Sacramento and San Joaquln valleva
and in the Salinas Valley on the sugar
plantations. The time to act is come or
the remedy will be useless."
Professor E. A. Ross of Stanford Uni
versity followed in- a thoughtful and elo
quent discussion of the economic phases
of the problem. He declared that primar
ily the Chinese and Japanese are im
possible among us because they cannot
assimilate with us; they represent a. dif
ferent and an inferior civilization to our
own and mean by their presence the deg
radation of American labor and American
life. We demand a protection for the
American workmen as well as for Amer
ican products, the speaker insisted. And
should the worst come to the worst it
would be better for us if we were to turn
our gur;s upon every vessel bringing Jap
anese tfj our shores rather than to permit
them to land.
T. V. Eddy followed, speaking at some
length and reviewing generally what hs
predecessor had said. He declared that
the protection of a people cannot be sac
rificed by constitution, statute or treaty
and that all should give way to the
higher demand which a people makes for
protection against an Inferior race
t* TI \% !^ st speaker of the evening was P.
H. McCarthy,, whose address was neces
sarily brief as the hour was late He
confined himself to a recital of what he
claimed, to be incidents where Japanese
have di Vlaced white men and white
women in employment in shops, factories
and the fields. "In The Call of last Wednes
day." he said, "was a communication to
the editor of that paper from a man
named Wehner, who declared that he was
not in sympathy with the policy of The
Call in opposing Japanese immigration
and that in his opinion there is room for
20.WO more Japanese in this State.
"You all know this man Wehner. He
came here, opened the panorama of 'The
Battle of Manila,' and closed it because
he employed cheap labor. It is such as
he who would brin? the Japanese among
us. In this State .a per cent of the sugar
beets produced are produced by Japanese
labor. It would be better if no sujjar
beets were raised than to have them un
der such conditions. Are we going to
permit the sugar barons to solve this
problem for us??"
With this address the meeting clo'sed
and It was announced that probably many
more will be held before the agitation
ceases.
