not only to maintain our subjugated, our foreign possessions, but for the purpose of holding
tha people at home under bayonet rule so that the new aristocracy based upon wealth shall

and of the people were expended in developing our own country, in reclaiming its arid lands,
in opening its mines,' in felling its forests, in developing new homes for itself. They be
lieved that land ownership made "the- better citizen and imbued the citizen with a deeper love
of country. Now ,the. power, of this Government is diverted from development at home to sub
jugation and oppression abroad. Then there was no question but that the constitution covered
every citizen and protected every square mile of territory over which this Government held
control. â¢
Then the trusts were practically unknown. .Now, they are a fierce consuming power,

The Democrats in 1896 nominated Mr. Bryan. The People's party a" month later nomi
nated Mr. Bryan. They tell me that the nomination of Mr. Bryan by our people was a con
cession to Democracy, that the People's party displayed a wonderful magnanimity, and for
bearancs in taking up the candidate of another party. I say no, we did not, nominate Mr.
Bryan to please the Democrats. We cared not what their? will or their pleasure was. The
People's party, standing on its platform, would have been untrue to itself, untrue to its prin
ciples, had itnominated any other man; had it refused to give all its power and influence for
theelection of aPresident imbued with the true, spirit of Jeffersonian Democracy, .which is the
same thing, if not in name, at least in spirit, as the spirit of populism declared at Omaha.
If there was a necessity, if it was the Populists' duty in 1896 to co-operate with the Demo
cratic and Silver Republican parties for the election of Mr. Bryan, how much greater is that
necessity now. In 1896 imperialism had not even.shovm its head. Now it is a cloud covering
the American heavens and pledging the American Government to a system of subjugation and
spoliation of other peoples, wherever the lustful eye of a grasping administration may
rest upon them. .";,), , Cii!^
SIOUX FALLS, S. D., May 10.â The speech of : Thomas M. Patterson of Colorado upon becoming
permanent chairman of the fusion Populist convention to-day created much comment and was
loudly Applauded by the delegates. After reviewing the troubles of the party, Chairman Patter

AGAINST ADMINISTRATION'S POLICY
Continued on Second Page.
It was Immediately moved to suspend
the rules,' but the motion was lost on a
standing vote and Chairman Patterson acl
Howard S. Taylor of Illinois made an
Impassioned appeal in favor of an imme
diate nomination and urged that Charles
A. Towne be the nominee, calling him the
"Chevalier Bayard of 1S96."
Â¦ "There could be no more fitting running
mate for Mr. Bryan," said Taylor. :
The Senator, hoarse -but determined
against postponing action and waiting: on
the decision of the Democratic party, ar
gued earnestly for the nomination of a
candidate for Vice President.
"Then," .said Senator Butler, "I hope
that the convention will never put It be
hind it." (Cheers.)
Senator Butler then moved to proceed
to the nomination of Vice President, "if
the chair rules that the original motion
is still before the convention."
"The original motion is before the
house," said Chairman Patterson.
Brown of Massachusetts offered to with
draw in favor of the Simpson amendment
his original motion of pushing the conven
tion to a vote, but it was ruled that the
motion had been made the subject of de
bate and could not be withdrawn.
Then came a long argument over amend
ments, substitutes, amendments to amend
ments, and the convention became tangled
up in a maze'of parliamentary procedure.
Jerry Simpson offered a substitute to the
amendment of General Weaver providing
that if no man was agreed at the
Kansas City conference the National
Committee should select, a candidate.

for conference and that if no man accept
able to the People's party was selected at
the conference the committee should se
lect a nominee.
General Weaver of Iowa offered a sub
stitute for the motion of Brown and the
amendment of Washburn that It was the
sense of the convention that no nomina
tion be made at the present time. He
desired that a committee of one man from
each State should proceed to Kansas City
Washburn of Massachusetts offered an
amendment to the motion of Mr. Brown
that five names be selected as men accept
able to the People's party and that a com
mittee be sent with these names to confer
with "the Democrats and Silver Republi
cans at Kansas City on July 4, with the
understanding that the name selected at
that conference should be the nominee of
the People's party for Vice President.
Instantly there was confusion. The one
point upon which the convention could
expect a fight was before It. There were
loud cries of "Pettigrew," but the' chair
recognized E. Gerry Brown of Massa
chusetts, who moved that the convention
proceed to nominate a candidate for Vice
President by ballot. There were numer
ous seconds from the' body of the conven
tion, and Senator Butler of North Carolfna
made a seconding speech from the plat
form. . â¢
"The next thing on the programme."
said Chairman Patterson, "is, according
to the rules adopted, to take action re
garding the nomination of a Vice PresI
dent."
Another cheer greeted this announce
ment, and then the delegates settled in
their seats to fight over the question of a
Vice Presidential nominee.
"I announce the nomination by a unanU
mous vote of William Jennings Bryan for
President of the United States," said
Chairman Patterson as soon as he could
be heard.
As one man th$ convention arose, hats,
canes, umbrellas and flags were waved in
the, air amid deafening cheers, the uproar
being increased by the band playing "Ola
Hundred."
Amid the din that followed Senator Al
len'a motion and its seconding the speak
er's voice was faintly heard calling on
those delegates who favored the motion to
rise and remain standing.
"Mr. Chairman," said he, amid perfect
silence, "I move that the rules of this
convention be stispended and that William
Jennings Bryan be nominated by accla
mation for President of the United
States."
Delegate Olds of Pennsylvania, now S6
years old, who voted for Henry Clay In
1S44 and is nov.- for William J. Bryan, was
next Introduced. Olds, bent and white
bearded, s=aid he had walked a thousand
miles to vote for Henry Clay in 1S44. "I
came 1000 miles to vote for William J.
Bryan in this convention," said Mr. Olds,
"and I hope you will not allow me to be
defeated, as I was In 1S44."
Cries of "We Tvon't" greeted Mr. Olds
as ho sat down. AK. Jones of Illinois as
sured the convention that his State would
give Mr. Bryan a majority in November.
Senator Allen of Nebraska stepped for
ward.
The chair recognized "Cyclone" Davis
of Texas and a shout went up as the tall
form of Mr. Davis loomed up on his way
to the platform.
Jerry Simpson was then announced amid
visrorous applause. It was enough, he
said, to say of Mr. Bryan that he had
risen head and shoulders above his com
peers in the Democratic party, and that
he had also captured the People's Party
as well. Mr. Bryan, he declared, repre
sented the struggle for human rights, anil
he wanted the Populists to stand by him
and do all in their power to elect him,
thus taking the first step toward restor
ing the country to its old-time glory.
veteran from Iowa came forward to sec
ond the nomination of Mr. Bryan.
The rules of the party In uÂ«e are approved:
the division of the country into seven districts
and sub-districts to facilitate organization: all
delegate conventions for nominating candidates
and rreparing platforms to be abolished. In
stead nomination and platforms and amend
ments thereto shall be made by direct vote of
the political subdivisions affected thereby.
Party organization shall consist of a national
committee of three members from each State,
to be chosen by the State Central Committee: a
Congressional committee of three for each dis
trict to be chosen by direct vote at the primar
ies; a committee of three from each township
or ward to be chosen by direct vote at the
primaries each year. The national. State, Con
gressional and county committees to perform
the rame duties as heretofore. The unit of or
ganization shall be the precinct club, of which
any voter may become a member by subscribing
to the Platform and rules of this organization.
Any one proposing fusion with either the Re
publican or Democratic party shall, on the
vote of his club, be deemed outside of the party.
The State platform may be changed only by
direct vote of the precinct club and the national
platform only by the clubs ratified by direct
vote of the people. No salaried office holder
shall be elected to any committee. Any chair
man may be re-elected by the Imperative man
dates of the league clubs of his constituency.
It was. provided that this plan should be modi
fied by laws of States to conform with sai<i
laws. \ '
As soon as the foregoing plan had been
accepted Chairman Felton read the plat
form formulated; by his committee. Joel
Parker of Kentucky offered an amend
ment plank- opposing trusts and favoring
public ownership - of public utilities. Sev
eral of the members of the committee on
resolutions opposed any change in the
platform. After a rather extended debate
Parker's amendment was adopted.
J. B. Osborne of Nebraska declared that
the declaration for' the free coinage of
gold and silver was practically a demand
creating a special privilege, and he moved
to strike out that portion of the platform.
, A motion. to lay his motion on the table
carried by a large majority of 530 to S2.
The platform. was then adopted practical
ly by unanimous vote.
Nominations for the Presidency were
then declared In. order.
Professor J. A. Boyce of Nebraska
placed In nomination former Congressman
Milford W. Howard of Alabama.
General Phllipps of Georgia, the famous
The middle-of-the-road plan of organi
zation, which was presented to the con
vention early In the day by the committee
on organization and unanimously adopted,
follows:
Followers of Social Democracy and
Eugene V. Debs for the Presidency of the
United States found small comfort in the
convention, which they had hoped a few
days ago would Indorse their Idol. Three
of them â W. E. Farmer of Texas, A. W.
Rleker and L. M. Morris of Iowaâ left" thÂ«Â»
convention after ' the nominations had
been completed, and it was reported would
support the Debs ticket, but their action
attracted no attention whatever.
After having been in session contin
uously with the exception of twenty min
utes' recess from 8:30 a. m. to 4:40 p. m.,
the convention was v then declared ad
journed sine die.
' A- motion was. Just about to prevail to
make Park's selection unanimous when
Howard, In an eloquent address, present
ed the name of J. A. Parker of Kentucky.
His words and praise of Parker was about
the strongest thing heard on the floor and
won for that young man the unanimous
selection for the national chairmanship.
tory flowed freely from side to side, while
the hungry delegates Journeyed from
time to time to a free lunch counter in
the vicinity. The motion was finally car
ried and Milton Park of Texas, the re
tiring: national chairman, was placed In
nomination.
The next order of business was the mat
ter of national, commltteemen and the se
lection of a chairman for that body. This
precipitated the fight against the Barker
ites anew. A motion was made that the
convention proceed , to elect a. chairman of
the national- committee, instead of pur
suing the ordinary course of allowing the
committee to select its -own leader. It
was plainly a fight between the Barker
and opposition factions for the control of
the ; party machinery t although many
speakers 'were 'In favor of the convention
selecting a national chairman, because of
what they termed the mistakes of the
past. After a long parliamentary wrangle
the motion was withdrawn and the selec
tion of national committeemen by the
State 1 delegations was completed. A fresh
motion was then' made by Mr. Howard
that the convention proceed to the elec
tion of a national chairman. Fiery ora-
"Without a . dissenting voice Ignatius
Donnelly was declared Vice Presidential
nominee.
On the second ballot Howard's plainly
stated desire for harmony took effect and
the seventy votes which went to Don
nelly on the first rollcall were gradually
worked over to the Barker, column,' it
being understood that Donnelly's name
had been withdrawn, although the Min
nesota delegation protested against tho
withdrawal. Minnesota was passed at its
own request, and when the other States
had voted It was apparent that the forty
eight votes of Minnesota could settle
everything In a harmonious manner by
going to Barker. They were cast for
Barker and gave hlm % the requisite major
ity over all. The generous Howard moved
to make the selection of Barker unani
mous, which was done.
To-day, as the time drew near for the
nominations, word was quietly parsed,
confirmed by Howard himself, that the
Barker following would bolt the conven
tion should their leader be turned down.
Owing to the fact that the Alabama dele
gation could not support Mr/ Howard mat
ters were further complicated. Howard
took the only course for the restoration
of harmony. He announced that he had
no ambition to head the ticket and came
to Cincinnati without the slightest expec
tation of being named. Then he with
drew his name. Nevertheless, when the
rollcall was completed on the first ballot
Howard was at the top of the column
only a few short of the nomination.

destroyed the foundation upon which that

SIOUX FALLS, S. D., May 11.â The
National Populist Convention con
cluded its session at 1 o'clock this
morning and adjourned sine^ die
after nominating the Hon. W. J-
Bryan for President and the Hon. Charles
A. Towne for Vice President. The nomi
nation of Mr. Tcwne wa6 only accom
plished after a struggle of several hours"
duration, in which an effort was made to
have the question of the nomination of
a Vice Presidential candidate referred to
a committee to confer with the Demo
cratic ar;d silver Republican parties in
their national conventions. A motion to
this effect was defeated by a vote of 26S
to 452.
Both candidates were nominated by ac
clamation, but before the result was
reached various candidates were placed
in nomination and their names succes
sively withdrawn. Both nominations
were accomplished amid scenes of great
enthusiasm.
PBOCEEDINGS IN DETAIL.
SIOUX FALLS. S. D.. May 10.â The
lonp financial plank of the platform, in
cluding the denunciation of the recent
banking law, and especially the demand
for the free coinage of silver at the ratio
of 16 to 1. was received with wild cheer
ing. The demand for an inheritance tax
.also received a round of applause. Vig
orous cheering was also accorded the
reading of. the plank on transportation,
the demand for the abolishment of all
tariffs on "trust goods" and the indorse
ment of the initiative and referendum.
Cries of "good! good!" greeted the de
nunciation of the administration's Philip
pine policy and the Porto Rican tax.
When that portion of me plank extend
ing sympathy to the South African re
publics and denouncing any alliance with
foreign powers was read the convention
broke into wild applause, lasting for some
time. Indorsement of the municipal own
ership of public utilities received but
faint applause, but vigorous handclapplng
ensued when direct election of United
States Senators was demanded.
At the conclusion of the reading of the
platform. Jerry Simpson moved that the
platform be adopted as read and the com
mittee discharged. The motion received
half a dozen seconds.
"The platform Is adopted by unanimous
vote." announced Speaker Patterson.
"The next thing In th*Â» convention." said
he. "is the presentation of the names of
candidates for the nomination for the of
fice of President of the United States."
Then, without pausing or calling for any
roll of States, he went on: "I have the
pleasure of Introducing Senator Allen of
Nebraska."
This could mean but one man and that
was Bryan, and before Senator Allen
could come to the front of the platform
the convention was on Its feet cheering
frantically, waving flags, hats and hand
kerchiefs. .
The speech of Senator Allen was brief
and to the point. .
The announcement of Bryan's name was
the signal for another enthusiastic out
burst. The Minnesota delegation hoisted
a large star having the portrait of Mr.
Bryan In the center and the convention
cheered again more vigorously than, be
fore.
When his voice could be heard. Chair
man Patterson announced: "I have the
pleasure to Introduce General James B.
Weaver of Iowa."
An outburst of cheers ranÂ«j out as the

TON, May 10.â Senator Hanna. who
is much occupied with the Repub

night:
"Advices Just received from Philadel
phia indicate that everything will be
ready in time and that city and people
are prepared,, to give the delegates to the
National Republican Convention of 1000 a
hearty reception and generous hospitality.
"As State and district conventions have
been held and delegates chosen we havn
been receiving visits or letters which in
dicate perfect harmony on national ques
tions and the choice of a nominee for the
head of the ticket. Â»
"The selection of a man for the second
place Is open, has always been, and will
so continue until the convention shall
have made its choice.
"There has been much discussion of dif
ferent men for the place, which is very
interesting and proper, but when It is
said that any particular man has the
preference it is a mistake.
"Governor Roosevelt will not be nom
inated for Vice ' President and has not
been discussed In that connection by the
party leaders or those who might speak
for the administration. What has been
said about him has been purely specu
lative from sources unacquainted with
facts.
"Assertions made here and there that
the President is concerning himself with
the choice of his associate on the ticket
do him an injustice. He has invariably
declined to take any part, notwithstand

his own friends and friends of the gentle
man put forward. It would be manifestly
inappropriate for him to take part in sucti
movements.

best interests of the party and all con
cerned shall determine.

VOLUME LXXXVIIâ NO. 172.
Now the doctrine is promulgated that we may have both citizens and subjects; that the
constitution is for a special class; that Congress and the President may make such laws as
they. see fit to govern all its people who are not citizens of one of the sovereign States of the
Unionâ a cruel and more despotic power, than which a Caesar or an Alexander or a Napoleon
could not have made greater. Then government by .injunction was in its incipiency. Now,
government by injunction is almost one of the fixed Institutions of the land, one of the un
questioned powers of the, courts. Then the trial 'of ; those engaged in labor .disputes by
a jury of their, countrymen was hardly denied. Now' it has become fixed that Â¦whoever engages
in labor disputes inky be arrested without warrant, may be charged with a crime not noted
in the statutes of the country; may be tried by, a Judge and denied a jury, may be punished
without ': law by fines and imprisonment that have never been provided for in the statute books
of ;i the : country, t (Cheers).'

-Washburn's compromise measure, pro
viding for the selection by ballot of five
names to be presented by a committee to
the Democratic and Silver Republican
conventions and from which to endeavor
to select a. candidate for Vice President,
was again brought forth by Jerry Simp
son, only to be defeated, and the Vice
Presidential question was at last settled.
The vote stood 270 votes for and 626 votes
against. Â¦ i
.Senator Allen then took the chair. Chair
man Patterson's voice having given out.
Amid much confusion the vote resulted
262 votes for and 492 votes against. In the
midst of the applause which followed the
announcement of the result Senator Allen
arose and nominated Charles A. Towne
of Minnesota for Vice President, moving
that the nomination be unanimous.
Simpson was given the floor for the
closing argument in behalf of his amend
ment.
The substitute Introduced by Simpson
was finally put to a vote. It provided for
the appointment of a committee to go to
Kansas City and confer with thÂ© Demo
cratic Committee In regard to a VJee Pres
idential candidate.
After a long discussion on the parlia
mentary position of the various motions,
amendments and substitutes the chair
man held that the original question was
the amendment offered by Jerry Simpson,
which provided that the National Com
mittee should go to Kansas City for con
ference with the Free Silver Republicans
and Democrats regarding the Vice Presi
dency.
Chairman Patterson asked the conven
tion if it desired any further debate on
the question of the Vice Presidency.
Amid cries of "Put him out," "Shut up"
and "Shame on you," Mr. Kelly returned
to his delegation, every member of which
was standinc on his feet.
Kelly spoke several times, causing great
confusion.
Pale with passion he again turned
toward Chairman Patterson and pointing
his finger at him cried: "You, sir, are try
ing to gratify a petty spite originating in
to-day's conference."
Then, turning toward the wildly shout
ing delegates he yelled: "I defy you. 1
defy you to put me out!"
"I rise to a point of order," shouted Mr.
Kelly. "I stand on my rights and you
can't bunko me out of them."
Former Congressman John "Kelly of
South Dakota, who had been clamoring
for recognition all day, at once advanced
and, with his voice shaking with anger,
said: "The South Dakota delegation is
glad to receive this recognition from the
chair, for it is the only recognition it has
received from you. You are a miserable
bunko steerer," Mr. Kelly shouted. "You
came into this convention with professions
of good faith. You are not fit to preside
over a Populist convention and you never
will again."
In an instant there was an uproar and
cries of "Put him out" were heard.
"Before Mr. Groce speaks,", said the
chairman, "the chair wishes to announce
that there is a package of letters here
for the South Dakota delegation. It* was
found on a chair and was probably lost
by some member of the delegation."
Edward S. Groce of Michigan was then
recognized. But just here an incident oc
curred that threw the convention into an
uproar, and which, for a few moments,
threatened to result in a free flght.
E. Gerry Brown of Massachusetts urped
harmony, but Insisted on naming a com
plete ticket.
At 8:10 p. m. Chairman Patterson called
the convention to order and recognized
Washburn of Massachusetts. "Washburn
spoke at some length in favor of his plan
of submitting a list of five men for Vice
President. He yielded the floor to General
Weaver, who told the convention that it
was ; willinc to be an ally of the Demo
cratic party, byt wished to do all the dic
tating to those allies instead of working
in concert with thorn. He told the dele
gates repeatedly that they would make a
grave mistake by nominating a Vice Pres
ident without consulting with the Demo
cratic party.
cordingly announced an adjournment un
til 8 p. m.
THK People"s party of the United States, assembled in national convention, this
tenth day of May, 1500, affirming our unshaken belief in the cardinal tenets of the
People's party as set forth in the Omaha platform and pledging ourselves anew
to continued advocacy of those grand principles of human liberty until right shall
triumph over might and love over greed, do adopt and proclaim this declaration of faith:
1. We demand the initiative and referendum and the imperative mandate for such
changes of existing fundamental and statute law as will enable the people in their sov
ereign capacity to propose and compel the enactment or repeal of such laws as they deem
required by their interests, and to recall unfaithful public servants.
2. We demand the public ownership and operation of those means of communication,
transportation and production which the people may elect, such as railroads, telegraphs
and telephone lines, coal mines, etc.
3. The land. Including all natural sources of wealth, is a heritage of the people and
should not be monopolized for speculative purposes and alien ownership of land should
be prohibited. All land now held by railroads and other corporations 'in' excess of their
actual needs and all lands now owned by aliens should be reclaimed by the Government
and held for actual settlers only.
4. A scientific and absolute paper money, based upon the entire wealth and popula
tion of the nation, not redeemable in any specific commodity, but made a full legal
tender for all debts and receivable for all taxes and public dues and issued by the Gov
ernment only, without Jhe intervention of banks and in sufficient quantity to meet the
demands of commerce, is tho best currency that can be devised; but, until such a finan
cial system Is secured, which we shall press for adoption, we favor the free and un
limited coinage of both silver and gold at the legal ratio of 16 to 1,
5. We demand the levy and collection of a graduated tax on Incomes and inheritances
and a constitutional amendment to secure the same if necessary.
6. We demand the election of the President, Vice President, Federal Judges and
United States Senators by direct vote of the people.
7. We are opposed to trusts and declare the contention between the old parties on
the monopoly question is a sham battle, and that no solution of this mighty problem
Is possible without the adoption of the principle of public ownership of public utilities.
j Cincinnati, Ohio, May 10, 1900.
Platform Adopted by the Middle-of-the-
Road Populists' Convention at
Cincinnati.
FOR PUBLIC OWNERSHIP
OF PUBLIC UTILITIES
and the means of the transmission of Informationâ which instruments of commerce are public
functions and which our forefathers declared In the constitution should be controlled by
the people through their Congress for the public welfare. The one remedy for tha trusts Is
that the ownership end control be assumed and exercised by the people.
We further demand that all tariffs on goods controlled by a trust should be abolished.
To cope with the trust evil the people must act directly without the Intervention of
representatives, who m'ay be controlled or Influenced. We therefore demand direct legisla
tion. giving the people the lawmaklng and the veto Dower under the Initiative and ref-"
erendum. A majority of the people can never b* corruptly Influenced.
Applauding the valor of our army and navy in the Spanish war, we denounce the con
duct of the administration in. changing a war tor humanity into a war for conquest. The
action of the administration in the Philippines is In conflict with all the precedents of
our national life, at war Â¦with the Declaration of Independence, the constitution and the
plain precepts of humanity. Murder and arson have been our response to the appeals of
the people who asked only to establish a free government in their own land. We de
mand a. stoppage of this war of extermination by the assurance to the Philippines of inde
pendence and protection under a stable government of their own creation.
The Declaration of Independence, the constitution and the American flag are one and
inseparable. The island of Porto Rico is a part of the territory of the United States and
by levying special and extraordinary customs duties on the commerce of that Island the ad
ministration has violated the constitution, abandoned the fundamental principles of Amer
ican liberty and has striven to give the lie to the contention of our forefathers that there
ehould be no taxation without representation.
Out of the imperialism which would force an undeslred domination on the people of the
Philippines eprlne the un-American cry for a large standing army. Nothing In the char
acter or purposes of our people justifies us in ignoring the plain lessons of history and
putting our llbertirs in jeopardy by assuming the burden of militarism, which is crush
ing the people of the Old World. We denounce the administration for Its sinister efforts
to substitute a standing army for the citizen soldiery, which Is the best safeguard of the re
public \
We extend to the brave Boers of South Africa our sympathy and moral support in their
patriotic struggle for the rl^ht of solf-government and we art* unalterably opposed to any
alliance, open or covert, between the United States and any, other nation that will tend'
to the destruction of human liberty. '
And a further manifestation of Imperialism is to be found In the mining districts of
Idaho. In the Coeur d' Alene soldiers have been used to overawe miners striving for a
irreater measure of Industrial Independence. And we denounce the State Government of
Idaho and the Federal Government for employing the military arm of the- Government 'Â¦ to
abridge the civil rights of the people and to enforce an infamous permit system which de
nies to laborers their Inherent liberty and compels them to forswear their manhood and
their right before being permitted to seek employment.
The Importation of Japanese and other laborers under contract to serve â¢ monopolistic
corporations is a notorious and flagrant violation of the Immigration laws. We demand that Â¦
the Federal Government shall take cognizance of this menacing evil, and repress it under
exerting laws. â¢â¢-.-Â¦
We further pledge ourselves to strive for the enactment of most stringent laws for the
exclusion of Mongolian and Malayan immigration.
We indorse municipal ownership of public utilities and declare that the advantages
which have accrued to the public under that system would be multiplied a hundred foldhby
its extension to natural interstate monopolies. ..â¢Â¦Â¦Â¦ .
We denounce the practice of issuing injunctions in the cases of dispute between em
ployers and employee, making criminal acts by organizations which â¢ are not criminal when
performed by individuals, and demand legislation to restrain the evil. ..--,:;
We demand that United States Senators and all other officials as far as practicable be
elected by direct vote of the people. .
Believing that the elective franchise and untrammeled ballot are essential to a govern
ment of, for and by the people, the People's party condemns the wholesale system . of dls
franchisement by coercion and intimidation adopted in some States as unrepublican and un
democratic And we declare It to be the duty of the several State Legislatures to take* such
action as will secure a full, free and fair ballot and an > honest count. Â¦ â¢; â¢ . Â¦ . : -.. ......
' .We favor home rule in the Territories and the District of, Columbia arid the early ad
miEsion of the Territories as States. -
- We denounce the expensive red tape system, political favoritism, cruel and unnecessary
delay and criminal evasion : of the statutes in the management of the Pension Office and
demand tbe honest execution of law* and tha fulfillment by the nation of its pledges of
service pension to ail of its honorably discharged veterans. .
Sioux Falls. S. D.. May 10, 1300.
Fusion Populists' Convention at Sioux Falls
Denounces the Administration for
Its Imperial Policy.
THE People's party of the L'nited States in convention assembled, congratulating it"
eurporteis on the wid? extension of Its principles in all directions, does hereby re
affirm ite adherence to the fundamental principles proclaimed In its two prior plat
forms and calls upon all who desire to avert the subversion of free institutions by
corporate and imperialistic power to unite with It In bringing the Government back to the
Ideals of Washington, Jefferson, Jackson and Lincoln.
It extends to Its allies in the struggle for financial and economic freedom, assurances
of its loyalty to the principles which animate the allied forces and the promises of hon
est and hearty co-operation in every effort for their success. To the people of the
United States we offer the following platform as the expression of our unalterable con
victions: â¢ ' -
Resolved. That we denounce the act of March 14, 1900, as the culmination of a long
series of conspiracies to deprive the people of their constitutional rights over the money
of the nation and relegate to a gigantic money truet the control of the finances and
hence of the people. We denounce this act.
Firstâ For making all money obligations, domestic and foreign, payable In gold coin
or Its equivalent, thus) enormously increasing the burdens of the debtors and enriching
the creditors. . .
Secondâ For refunding "coin bonds"' not to mature for years Into long-time gold bonds,
so as to make their payment improbable and cm r debt perpetual.
Thirdâ For taking from the treasury over fifty millions of dollars In a time of war
and presenting it at a premium to bondholders to accomplish the refunding of bonds
not due. Â£
Fourthâ For doubling the capital of bankers by returning to them the face value of
their bonds in current money notes. Â«a that they may draw one interest from the Gov
ernment and another from the people.
Fifthâ For allowing banks to expand and contract their circulation at pleasure, thus
controlling prices of all products.
Sixthâ For authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to Issue new gold bonds to an
unlimited amount whenever he deems It necessary to replenish the gold hoard, thus en
abling usurers to secure more bonds and more bank currency by drawing gold from the
treasury, thereby creating an "endless chain" for perpetually adding to a perpetual debt.
Seventhâ For striking down the greenback in order to force the people to borrow three
hundred and forty-six millions of dollars more from the banks at an annual cost of over
twenty millions of dollars.
Â¦-- I While barring: out the money of the constitution, this law opens the printing mints of
- the treasury to the free coinage of bank paper money to enrich the few and impoverish
the many. â¢ \J.
- ' We pledge anew the people's party never to cease the agitation until this financial con
spiracy Is blotted from the statute books, the Lincoln greenback restored, the bonds all
paid and all corporation money forever retired.
â¢ We reaffirm the demand for the reopening of the mints of the United States to the frea
and unlimited coinage of silver and gold at the present legal ratio of 14 to 1, the immediate
increase in the volume of . f-llver coins and certificates thus created to be substituted dollar
for dollar for the bank notes : leeued by the private corporations under special privilege
' granted *by' the law of March 14. 1900. and prior national banking laws, the remaining por
tion "of the bank notes to be replaced with full legal tender Government paper money and Its
volume so controlled as to maintain at all times a stable money market and a stable price
- level.
We demand a graduated Income and inheritance tax, to the end that aggregated wealth
1 shall bear its Just proportion of taxation. Â¦-; - t Â¦:.,.Â¦;?
We demand that postal savings banks be established by the Government for the safe
deposit of the savings of the people and to facilitate exchange.
With Thomas Jefferson, we declare the land, including all natural sources of wealth, the
inalienable heritage of the people. The Government should bo act as to secure homes for
the people and prevent land monopoly. The original homestead policy should be enforced
and future settlers upon public domains shou'.d be entitled to a free homestead, while all
who have paid an acreage price to the Government under fxlstlng laws should have their
homestead rights restored. f
Transportation being a means of exchange and a public necessity, the Government should
own and operate the railroads In the interests of the people and on a non-partisan basis,
to the end that all may be accorded the same treatment In transportation and that tha
extortion, tyranny and political power now exercised by the great railroad corporations, which
result in the impairment If not the destruction of the political rights and personal liberties
of the citizen, may be destroyed. Such ownership la to be accomplished In a manner con
sistent with Bound public policy.
Trusts., the overshadowing evil of the age, are the result and culmination of the private
ownership and control of the three great Instruments of commerceâ money, transportation

When these messengers become de-
ranged or the supply of 'nerve forte is
depleted, the best remedy to restore
them : to their normal ; condition is Dr.
Miles' : Restorative Nervine. It creates
a good appetite, gives refreshing sleep,
and cures that tired feeling. It acts on
the nervous ; system, which controls all
the Â¦ processes ; of , the body, toning it up
into sound and vigorous action. It over-
comes the excessive wasting -and puts
back the lost flesh.
The nerves of the human body act as
messengers to convey to the brain im-
pressions of outward effects, and to con-
vey from the brain to the muscles and
organs nerve force or vital power.
Without this vital power the heart:
stomach, lungs, bowels and all organs
of the body would be unable to perform
their functions and life would < cease.
"I was troubled for thirty years with
weakness of the heart and nerves. Had
palpitation and fluttering of the heart up-
on slightest exertion and was generally
run down, weak and nervous. I found
that Dr. Miles' Nervine was the only rem-
edy that gave me relief, and I am satisfied
I would not be alive to-day buffor Its
use. My son and daughter have both
taken Dr. Miles* Nervine with best re-
sults. MRS. MARY EGGERS.
"London Mills, 111."
Two years ago I -was so run down that
my nerves became all unstrung and I al-

Opening' of a Hovel Exhibition of Na
ture's Handiwork at Pacific
Grove.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PACIFIC GROVE. May 10.â A very no
table scientific event opened in this city
this afternoon under the auspices of the
Pacilic Grove Museum Association which,
besides being the first affair of its kind
ever held in this section of California, is
also one of the first ever held on the Pa
cific Coast. It is a flower and natural
history exhibit â not a flower carnival or
litsta. but a veritable flower show in
Â¦which artistic effects are given second
ary- attention and the scientific Side of
the exhibits is paramount.
The hall in which the exhibition Is held
presents a very brilliant appearance, its
decorations being both appropriate and
Â«-lalÂ»orate. One entire side is devoted to
the display of live and dry specimens of
plant and animaJ life, some of Â¦which are
exceedingly valuable. Notable among
these are a collection of European in
lets owned by Thomas W. Cowan, a
wÂ«-H -known English naturalist; a collec
tion of North American ferns, owned by
Miss VL K. B. Morton of Pacific Grove,
and a complete collection of live ferns na
tive to Monterey County, owned by Mrs.
Jonathan Wright of Paclflc Grove.
The other side of the hall is occupied
by exhibits of sea life, animal and vege
table, including a scientific panorama of
the bottom of Monterey Bay; several val
uable aquaria and some very fine collec
tions of fcea mosses and shells.. The mis
cellaneous exhibits, all following out the
general plan, also include some remarka
ble specimens of plant and animal life,
â¢while the art and curio room contains
many interesting as well as very valua
ble articles.
The present exhibition possesses the
rare quality of being homogeneous
throughout, even the decorations being
made subservient to the one idea of
scientific interest. The fountain which
plays over mosses and ferns in the cen
ter of the main hall has its basin full of
interesting fish, the rocks about It are
geologically of value, even' branch of a
tree or cluster of flowers used in the dec
orations is placed with reference to its
family and class and the whole is won
dtriully successful, pleasing the eye as
Â¦well as the brain more than If thrown
together in the usual haphazard manner.
While important in many ways, this ex
hibition is chiefly so from the fact that
Monterey County, the "type locality" of
nearly all the plant life and much of the
animal life as well of California, is here
presented to the scientific public as never
before in the State's history, and many
botanists, entomologists and other scien
tists are present for the purpose of study-
Ing the exhibits.
The exhibition will continue three days,
with fine musical programmes each even
lug.
SCIENTIFIC SHOW OF
PLANT AND ANIMAL LIFE
It irtlT.be the desire of this sub-commit
tee to present this invitation at an early
day and in porson before the Mayor and
Board of Supervisors when in session.
Tbe members of this committee are J:
E. Ktubbs, R. L. Fulton, L. D. Folsom
and A. E. Cheney.
Recognizing the value of a clear and
frank interchange of views upon a ques
tion of such great importance to the two
communities, the committee named a sub
committee to bring to the attention of the
Mayor and Board of Supervisors the ad
visability of visiting Reno in order to in
vestigate for themselves, with such as
sistance as will be readily given them,
the merits of the question under consider
atioti.
The committee seemed to think that the
Mayor and Board of Supervisors would
desiro to know whether the proposed wa
ter supply for the city of San Francisco
could be obtained or not. and whether
Â¦water could be obtained in such a quanti
ty and under such conditions as to pro
tect the very important rights and inter
ests of those who now reside alone the
Truckee River.
The discussion of the committee pointed
clearly :o the conviction that, inasmuch
as the Mayor and Board of Supervisors of
the city of San Francisco had received a
suggestion that the water from Lake Ta
hoe might be utilized as an adequate wa
ter supply for the city of San Francisco
and oilier towns and cities around the
bay, it is to the interest of the Mayor
and Board of Supervisors to visit the
lake and towns along the Truckee, in or
der to ascertain by personal inspection
the property rights and interests now ex
ist i!:J,'.
RENO. Nev.. May 10.â The committee of
twelve appointed by the convention of clt
lrens of Reno and Truckee Valley met to
fiay to consider various subjects connect
ed with the storage and use of the waters
of Lake Tahoe and Truckee River regard-
Ing the water supply for San Francisco.
This important subject was very carefully
discussed by members of the committee
end with respect to the rights and inter
ests of those who naw beneficial use of
these waters or who propose to make ben
eficial use of them in the future.

The eighth annual cycle relay race, par

vicinity of this city, will take place next
Sunday. This year but three clubs have
entered the contestâ the Olympic and Bay
City clubs of this city and the Garden
Citys of San Jose. This Is because the
other clubs have not the necessary mate
rial to fit out a team of ten men, with ten
additional as trailers, and the large force
of judges and clerks necessary, so to the
three big clubs the contest Is left.
The Bay City Club won perpetual pos
session of the Varney cup three years
ago, and to perpetuate the race annually
Leavitt & Bill of this city offered another
beautiful trophy, which has already been
won once by the Bay Citys and once by
the Olympics. It .has to be won three
times to become the property of a club.
Sunday's race will start at 9 a. m. sharp
at - the â¢ corner â¢ of Larkin and McAllister
streets, Â¦ thence down Larkin and Ninth
streets and out of the city via Potrero
avenue and the San Bruno road, passing
through San Mateo, Redwood City, Menlo
and other points en route to San Jose;
then returning on the Oakland side of the
bay, the finish being in Alameda on Cen
tral avenue, , near Grand street, about
four hours and a half after, the start if all
goes well. The finish of the race is an in

FOR THE RELAY
The field was a trifle heavy from the
previous night's rain and the surface waa
loose, not giving the ponies the foothold
to which they are accustomed at Burlin
game. It was near the end of the first
period before either side scored. When
Peter Martin, the referee, threw the first
ball In "Joe" Tcbln took possession, but
was soon displaced by "\\ aterbury, -who
ran it toward the opposing team's goal.
Hobart was the next to get possession,
and he just missed a goal, the ball going
outside the posts. When the ball was
thrown in Joe Tobin was again the first
to get it. Waterbury drove it down the
field and then overshot it In a big gallop.
t>riscoll In two great drives sent it outside
the boundary line just by the posts. The
reds lost the ball on an off-side play, thus
witnessed by the largest assemblage of
spectators ever attracted to a similar con
test in this district. They came in four-in
hands and in simple phaetons, on horse
back and in streetcars, and quickly dis
tributed themselves about the picturesque
natural amphitheater In which the eight
clever horsemen met. The dramatic inci
dent of the day was furnished by John
Lawson, the unlucky, one of whose ponies
died under him. It is presumed a blood
vessel burst, as just at the end of a sharp
scrimmage the pony staggered forward a
few steps, then sank to Its knees. Lawson
stepped off and the pony rolled over on Its
back. He died immediately. A number of
the park policemen fastened their riataa
to him and dragged him off the field. Thia
was the only unpleasant incident of the
afternoon.
T7 A WHENCE WATERBURY. a mem
ber cf Foxhall Keane's polo team,
II j> the acknowledged champions of
America, did brilliant work in the
pame played yesterday afternoon in
cjolden Gate Park. His team, the whites,
won by a score of S to 3 goals, and of these
he contributed three. He was aided In a
marked degree by Walter Hobart. The
latter scored one goal and placed the ball
for Waterbury when he drove it between
the winning poets twice in quick succes
sion In the last moments of the game.
The winning team was made up of three
of the men who have just returned from
the polo fields of Southern California,
where they swept everything before them.
The fourth member of the champion team.
"Tom" Driscoll. was replaced by Richard
M. Tobln, Driscoll playing his usual sen
national game on the opposing side. . He
scored the first goal for his team. "Joe"
Tobin adding; the other two.
The game was one long thrill from start
to finish. The spectators frequently broke
into applause which the brilliancy of the
play forced from them, although the ma
jority of those viewing it had no technical
knowledge of the pastime. The game was.
giving the whites a free shot at It. As
the outcome of this play Waterbury ran
the ball down the middle of the field and
scored the first goal.
Hobart scored the next goal, and shortly
afterward Driscoll made a 50-yard drive,
placing the ball squarely between the
posts. The score was 2 to 1 in favor of the
whites. "Joe" Tobln evened the score
shortly afterward. He scored a third goal
for his side, despite the eff&rts put forth
by R. M. Tobin and Walter Hobart.
Charley Dunphy evened the score after a
hot scrimmage. Waterbury, aided by the
brilliant work of Hobart, scored two goals
in the last period, the whites thus win
ning by a score of S to 3. The teams were
made up as follows:
Whites. Position. Reds.
C. Dunphy 1 J. S. Tobln
"W. S. Hobart 2 T. Drlscoll
Jj. Waterbury 3 J. Laweon
H. M. Tobln 4 C. R. Duval
The play was fast and exciting through
out and formed a series of moving pic
tures of never-ending variety, the central
figures belns the eight ponies on the field
and their riders.
There is a possibility of a game being
played to-morrow afternoon. The ponies
are all on the ground, and there would be
but little additional trouble in arranging
other details. As it is purely the aim of
the Burlingame men to popularize polo,
this would be an excellent opportunity.
Many people could avail of the chance
offered to witness the game who would
never see it if played only at Burlingame.
Asbury Park quarters. He says he la fit
for the battle, and nobody who saw him
to-day would doubt his statement.
Masses of muscles stand out all over his
body, and he seems as strong as the pro
verbial ox. His confidence in his ability
to whip Corbett is convincing. The cham
pion is not much given to long speeches.
He restricts himself to concise and blunt
statements, and when asked his opinion
about the outcome he said: "I'll beat Cor
bett, and I'll do the trick in short order."
Corbett Confident.
Corbett honestly believes that he will
defeat Jeffries.
"I know," ho said to some friends who
visited him, "that all smart fellows
think I'm dead, but I'll prove to them to
morrow night that I am the liveliest pugi
listic corpse they ever saw. I've trained
properly for this bout, have taken plenty
of time to get into condition, and as a
result my health is better to-day than
at any" period during my career as a fight
er. I will enter the ring weighing 1S5
poundsâ five pounds more than when I
fought Fitzsimmons, and 100 per cent
stronger than when Lanky Bob beat me.
Jeffries has always been pretty lucky in
his fights, getting away without so much
as a blackened eye or bruised face, but
I'd like to bet he'll have a few marks on
him after he and I finish our bout at
Coney Island to-morrow night."
The advance sale of tickets for the fight
is said to have been very large. LTp to
last night it was reported that $22,000
worth of seats had been sold. The arti
cles of agreement call for twenty-five
rounds. Marquis of Queensberry rules to
govern. Hitting with one arm free will
be allowed, and each man will be ex
pected to take care-- of himself on the
breakaway. The men will enter the ring
at half past 9 o'clock.
At Jeffries' Home.
LOS ANGELES, May 10.â In spite of the
fact that this is the home of the cham
pion pugilist, there is no betting In, Los
Angeles on the Jeffries-Corbett fight. The
sporting fraternity does not appear anx
ious to put up $2 against $1 on a thing
they consider sure. The Jeffries people
are all sanguine about the outcome, but
are waiting for money at 10 to 7. One
poolseller offered to place money either
way at 2 to 1. Even this willingness did
not find a hearty response. From
present appearances, less money will be
placed than on any previous Jeffries
event. At Jeffries' home the usual quiet
ness prevails. If the family is deeply con
cerned no outward evidence is shown.
Interest Lukewarm Here.
That only a lukewarm interest Is taken
in the meeting of Corbett and Jeffries by
the sporting men of this city is shown by
the betting. But little money has been
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, May 10.â Absence of
pronounced betting interest is a
conspicuous feature of the heavy
weight championship battle to
take place to-morrow night in the
arena of the Seaside Sporting Club. Sev
eral reasons are advanced for the lack of
big wagers. One is that the leading
sporting men' are afraid to bet because of
the stories concerning Corbett's wonder
fully improved condition. While friends
of the former champion hope for the best,
they believe that the alleged improve
ment in Corbett's soundness is not so
marvelous as his trainers say it is. They
cannot believe that a man who has lived
as Corbett has can ever regain his former
strength and ability to cope succeasfully
wlth a ragged opponent. They know that
"Pompadour Jim" is far more clever with
his hands and feet than the powerful
young champion, but they doubt the stor
ies about improvement in his strength,
Etamina, capacity for punishment and
ability .to. deliver blows with aufflcient
force to make an effective impression on
the hard-muscled boiler-maker.
"[f Jim were only as good as he was
en the night he fought Sullivan," say the
former champion's friends, "we would
not hesitate to show our faith in his pu
gilistic prowess by backing him heavily,
but we do not believe the conqueror of
John L. is anywhere near the form he
showed on .that memorable night in New
Orleans."
Jeffries Money Plentiful.
There is plenty of Jeffries money in
sight. Friends of the Los Angeles Her
cules say that Jeffries' exhibition with
Sharkey clearly proved his claim to the
title of heavy-weight champion. In that
contest Jeffries practically fought the en
tire battle with one hand. A very good
judge of fighters who takes this view of
Jeffries' ability is "Rat" Masterson of
Denver. Masterson has always been an
admirer of Corbett and has bet on hire
in all his battles heretofore, but he has
said "that he couldn't figure "Jim" as
winner at this time.
"I know Corbett like a book," said Wi
A. Brady yesterday. "He is one of the
most nervous men in the world. He is
absolutely fearful of the result of a fight
as soon as he steps into a ring. This feel
ing grows on him as the fight progresses
and lasts usually for five or six rounds.
I calculate that Jeffries will beat him dur
ing, the period of his nervous spell. The
Los Angelesan is - absolutely devoid of
fep.r. He never worries." ; *
Jeffries finished his training to-day with
a short walk on the road in the morning,
and during the remainder of the day told
stories and Joked with his trainers at his
watered at Harry Corbett's in either the
straight betting or the mutuels. In the
former Jeffries Is favorite at odds of 10
to 3H- They are also betting even money
he will win in twelve round3. In th"*
mutuels Jeffries to in the greater demand.
The play is paltry as compared with that
on the Jeffries-Sharkey fight. On that oc
casion 12.000 tickets were sold. The total
at closing time last night was 41S. The
tickets sold on the different lines were:
Jeffries. Rounds. Corbett.

FAST DOGS WILL COURSE
FOR EXCELLENT PRIZES
A. Johnson's dogs, Tod Sloan and Low
lander, reached the final in the midweek
stake at Ingleside Coursing Park yetter
day, and their owner drew down first and
second money without running them to a
decision. The talent showed good judg
ment in picking favorites, save in a few
instances, and but four short ends suc
ceeded in raising {he flag during the en
tire stake. Independent won a course in
the run down against Lady Shamrock .on
the short end at 1" to 2." Both are new
dogs and were unheard of until yesterday,
their first time out. , The bettors gave
odds on an even thing for no other reason
than to make a gamble.
Lowlander beat Mount Ida in the first
tie after an undecided. In the first course
the dogs were selling at even money, but
in the second Lowlander went on the
short end at 2Vi to 1. He showed the speed
clean through and won as he pleased.
Green Isle3 beat Jesse Moore in the first
tie at 3 to 5 on a tluke. Jesse led well
and would have won. but the hare fav
ored Green Isle at every turn and Judge
Cramer's dog lost the race on a close
score.
At the same odds Tod Sloan got the. flag
from Firm Foe. Tod won strictly on
merit, beating his opponent pointless. The
odds offered were false. '

The offers of several individuals to sell
the city a water supply system were con
sidered at a meeting of the Supervisors'
Committee on Public Utilities last night.
J. E. Russell explained his proposition to
pipe 150,000,000 gallons of water .dally from
tiÂ»c north and middle forks of the Amer
ican River. City Engineer Grunsky'was
present and stated that immense quan
tities of water were going to waste at
the points named. Russell claims to own
S20 acres of land on both sides of the
river. The diversion of waters, he said,
would affect the rights of other users,
and the water would have to be stored.
Russell said he did not own any reservoir
sites and the American Ditch Company
and Folsom Water Company would prob
ably oppose the use of the water by other
parties. Hydraulic mining operations are
being carried on thirty miles above Rus
sell's property.
M. C. Taylor offered to sell his power
and water right of the North and Middle
Yuba rivers for $175,000. It would cost
$12,000,000 to deliver 60,000.000 gallons daily
ln this city by a two-pipe line. His right
comprised a flow of 175,000,000 gallons
daily in the dryest season-- Taylor said
there was only one party appropriating
the water above his property, and no one
used it below the point to which he had
a recorded right.
Chairman Reed reported that another
offer had been made by the Yuba Electric
and Power Company, which has an aver
age flow of 162,000,000 gallons daily, at
boo feet above sea level. The storage ca
pacity Is well developed by a system of
fakes, and power could be sold to Oak
land.
Further consideration of the various of
fers was pqstponed until next Thursday's
meeting. '

"Craig's reputation is bad," he said. "I
would not believe him under oath if his
testimony was contradicted by a reputable
person. I have reason to believe that ho
gave false testimony In the Von TIedeman
case. He swore that certain deeds in that
case were regularly acknowledged beforti
him, when," in fact, such was not the
case."
James K. Lynch, cashier of the First
National Bank, said that he believed
Craig's character as well as his reputa
tion to be bad, and added that he would
not accept his Identification at the , bank
because he would not believe him. .
"How long have you questioned Craig's
honesty?" was asked. '
"For more than nineteen years," the
witness responded. "And I once attempt
ed to have him removed from office, but
failed."
Joseph Hutchinson, a Palo Alto lawyer
and capitalist, said that E. C. Harrison
and W. W. Chase had told him that Craig
was not to be trusted. On cross-examin
ation, however, it developed that Craig
and Hutchinson had engaged In a busi
ness controversy, and Lafe Pence suggest
ed that doubtless this faet influenced his
opinion. W. Cf Spencer, P. J. Curtis and
Jamea K. Monatt also testified that
Craig's reputation for truth, honesty and
integrity was not good.
George W. â¢ Hopkins and* Charles C.
Fisher gave testimony regarding a real
estate transaction -which in a measure
tangled up the business hours on days
Mrs. Craven said the Senator was out
with her. Thomas S. Andrews, James M.
Wilkins and Herbert ; Clarke gave similar
testimony, after, which an adjournment
was taken. :
Counsel. for the respondents announced
that three witnesses would be called next
Monday and the case; would then close so
far as they were concerned. Mrs. Craven
will then be given an opportunity to pro
duce her rebuttal witnesses. >
Counsel representing the executors of the
Fair estate as well as the heirs have con
tended from the start that Craig did not
adhere to the truth. As there was no way
to disprove his assertion, however, but for
the purpose of creating a doubt in the
mind of the court regarding his assertion
several witnesses were called yesterday
to testify as to his reputation for truth,
honesty and Integrity. The first witness
on this line was Edgar D. Pelxotto, for
mer Assistant District Attorney.
Lee D. Craig's reputation for truth,
honesty and integrity was the main issue
in the Fair-Craven trial before Judge
Troutt yesterday. Two months ago Craig
appeared as a witness on behalf of Mrs.
Craven and testified that Senator Fair and
Mrs. Craven appeared before him and ac
knowledged the authenticity and legality
of the marriage contract on which Mrs.
Craven-Fair now seeks a widow's por
tion of the dead millionaire's estate. He
said the acknowledgment was made. In a
doorway on Sutter street and was never
placed on record, as Senator Fair was
overanxious that the fact of his marriage
should bo kept secret from his children
and the world.
Respondents Being Unable to Dis
prove That He Acknowledged
Marriage Contract Attack
His Veracity.
Witnesses Testify Against
Him During Hearing
of Fair Case.
LEE D. CRAIG'S
REPUTATION IS
PUT IN ISSUE
"The action of Superintendent Webster
in declaring the certificate of Mme. Gif
fard Illegal is absurd. There are more
than a hundred certificates held by teach
ers that are in the same cate
gory as that of Mme. Glffard.
Webster claims that her certifi
cate lapsed before she had it re
newed, and he therefore takes snap Judg
ment on the woman. Now. everybody
knows that certificates for special teach
ers are granted on the smallest provoca
tion, and It is a fact that though Mme.
Giffard failed to renew her certificate
within the legal period it is also a fact
that another certificate was issued by
the Board of Examiners upon her cre
dentials as a graduate from a French
academy, and also upon her original cer
tificate. This of itself Is a legal proceed
ing, and on these grounds the board be
lieves the certificate of Mme. Giffard to
be a legal one."
Superintendent Webster agrees with
Denman that the laws regarding certifi
cates for special teachers are rather loose,
but he still contends that Mme. Glffard's
certificate is not valid. In that connection
Webster says that the State Educational
Commission will seek to correct that de
fect at the next Legislature by having a
law passed requiring a special teacher to
have a regular certificate to teach after
an examination. Regarding Denman's
statement that there are more than a hun
dred illegal certificates in existence, Web
ster fays that it is Denman's duty to
point out where they are, and an investi
gation will follow. Webster says that
Deputy Superintendent Kingsbury has
probed the subject and has been able to
find but one certificate about which there
appears to be any question.
The Board of Education has taken Issue
with Superintendent of Schools Webster
In the case of Mme. Giffard, special
teacher of French. Chairman Mark an
nounced yesterday that her certificate,
which had been declared llllegal by Web
ster, is held to be valid by the board. Di
rector Denman agrees with his colleague
on the point, but as Superintendent Web
ster has refused to sign the demand of
Mme. Giffard it Is difficult to see what
benefit she will derive from the board's
decision. The Auditor will decline to audit
any demands of the School Department
unless countersigned by the Superintend
ent. Denman In discussing the subject
yesterday said:
Director Denman Claims Credentials
of Special French Teacher Are
Valid, but Is Opposed by
"Webster.
Board of Education Takes
Issue With the School
Superintendent.
MRS. GIFFARD'S
CERTIFICATE IS
A LEGAL PAPER
Richard McCann. the boy's father, was
nt Madera when the news of the disaster
reached him. He at once telegraphed for
further details, and then became satisfied
â¢when he read the answers that his son
was,, dead. He took the 6:30 train last
night for the. East and will bring the re
mains home should they prove to bÂ©
those' of his son.
About two weeks ago Dave McCann. son
of Richard McCann. the contractor, aim
feldney Jones ran away from their homes
In* San Francisco. Dave had run away
before, so his father took the matter Dhll
osophlcally, thinking that when the
lad got hungry he would' return.
Sidney s mothtr was in Sacramento when
she heard the news of her son's disao
l>earanee. She was taking part in the
street pugeant when the news was broken
to her. She was f>o shocked that for a
time her life was despaired of. She is
now In a precarious condition at 800 Van
Is ess avenue, her present residence.
When yeung McCann and Jones made ud
their minds to run away from home they
told the boys in the neighborhood of 217
Waller street (Mr. McCann's home) that
they were going to beat their way to New
York and then across the Atlantic to the
Paris Exposition. On the 6th lnst. Dave
wrote to his mother from Truckee that
they were getting along flrst rate and that
that night they were going to board a fast
freight train and beat their way to New
York. The supposition now is that the
boys were on the Union Pacific train and
were killed in the disaster at O'Neill
Siding.
"A bad wreck occurred at O'Neill Sid
ing, sixteen miles west of Rawllns. Wyo.,
on the Union Pacific, this evening. Four
men were killed and a number of others,
injured. A special fast freight eastbound
ran into an open switch and dashed down
a high embankment. * â¢ â¢ The dead
are Louis Banta, fireman; James John
son, lireir.an, and two boys aged about 20
years, who were stealing a ride; names
A train wreck In Wyoming has made
two families in San Francisco desolate.
The chances are that a mistake may have
been made, but the relatives expect the
worst, and the father of one of the sup
posed victims left on the overland last
night to bring buck the manpled remains
of two boys who had not yet passed out
of their teens.

Pond of Bethany Church. He Is one of
the most successful of the younger physi
cians.
THE engagement of Miss Phoebe
Painter and Dr. Gardner Perry Pond
was announced yesterday. Miss
Painter Is the granddaughter of the
late D. J. Staples and the niece of Mrs.
K. S. Yeamans. She is a charming young
lady, taiented and accomplished and a
great beauty. Dr. Pond, the fortunate
'Mineral Conference. In that event it was
i* salved by the society to recommend the
appointment of Secretary Abbott to Ham
mend's place.
It was reported that $14,000 had been paid
rn the debt cf the California-street M. E.
Church during- the past year, and that the
balcnce. $11,000. had been provided for.
At a meeting- of the hoard of managers
of the San Francisco Church Extension
Society held in the OrJifornia-street Meth
cdist Episcopal Church last night resolu
tions were adopted urging the General
Conference, now In session at Chicago,
not to change section 2, paragraph 24S. of
the discipline, relating to "Imprudent and
Unchristian Conduct." Resolutions favor-
Jr.g the retention of the present time limit
for pastors as set forth In section 1, para
graph 173. cf discipline were also adopted.
The resolutions will be forwarded to-day
by I. J. Truman, president, and William
M. Abbott, secretary.
The two paragraphs referred to have
< .reasoned considerable discussion in the
conference, and there appears to be a dis
position among the members to modify
the section relating to unchristian con
duct, which provides among other things
penalties In cases of buying, selling or
using intoaticatlng liquors as a beverage,
signing petitions in favor of granting
license for the sale of intoxicating liquors,
dancing, playing at games of chance, at
tending theaters, horse races, circuses,
oaxicmg parties or patronizing dancing
schools or taking such other amusements
as are obviously of misleading or ques
tionable moral tendency.
The other i-ection. which Is liable to be
changed, provides that the presiding elder
shall not allow any preaciier to remain la
the same pastoral charge more than five
consecutive years nor more than five
y^ars in any consecutive ten. Neverthe
less, if In any case the term of live years
shall expire in the interval between the
nest-ions of the annual conference he miiy
continue him until the next session, pro
vided the time shall not be more than tix
months.

Editor The Call: Your editorial In refer
ence Co the need of land surveys in our
State meets with general approval and Is
very much appreciated by many settlers,
who are Interested in Mendocino County.
In the past several years numerous peti
tions have been Bent to the Land Office by
settlers, asking that Iand3 upon which
they have located be surveyed, thereby
enabling them to secure patent and bjÂ» en
abled to' make use of timber ' and Â¦ t>ark,
that otherwise could not be utilized and Is
of no value to them. In no instance have
these requests been favored with the least
attention or encouragement that anything
Â¦would ever be accomplished to enable
them to secure patents to their homes. In
nearly all cases portions of townships
have been surveyed for several years, but
in every instance some so-called red tape
defect in the survey would cause the same
to be rejected, thereby leaving thousands
of acres of valuable land wide open to the
mercy of scrip land apents, Mho have
been enabled to cover the, best portions
with forest reserve scrip, greatly enriching
themselves and tying the lands up for
years to come to capitalists who have no
interest in our county and who are hold
ing It as an investment,' most likely for
their great-grandchildren, and depriving 1
the would-be bona. nde settlers from ob
taining lands justly belonging to them.
One instance on record may be found in
the case of Township 13 north, Range 16
west, Mount Diablo meridian., showing
how the smooth, Italian hand of the land
agents, with the assistance of the red tape
manipulations of Government land of
ficials, can steal the lands from settlors

CALIFORNIA LANDS SURVEYS
It is to be regretted that this enterprise should be
made one of partisan politics, but those who have
made it so must bear the responsibility. The men
who opposed the canal all along are now among
those who oppose the Hay-Pauncefote. treaty. They
are the most vociferous in their opposition, and their
allies are the Bryanites. If the Woodland Democrat
Certain facts in the case are beyond dispute. The
contest for the canal was virtually won. The admin
istration arranged a treaty which opened a way for
entering at once upon its construction. . The oppo
nents of the canal seized upon the treaty as a means
for fighting the canal itself. They denounced the
treaty as a surrender to Great Britain and demanded
its rejection. Certain yellow journals of the Bryanite
stripe saw a chance to make campaign capital against
the administration and they promptly went over to
the opposition and joined in denouncing the treaty.
Thus the project has been brought to a standstill.
The deadlock may possibly be broken, for it has been
disclosed that in the Senate itself there is a strong
feeling in favor of imnjediate action, but if .there be
postponement the delay* will be due to the men who
insist upon the rejection of the treaty by which the
construction of the canal has been arranged for.
Commenting upon the situation thus disclosed, The
Call pointed out that the defeat of the bill at this ses
sion, which now seems imminent, is due to'the men
who have antagonized the treaty, which was nego
tiated by the administration for the sole purpose of
promoting the speedy construction of the great water
way. That statement has disturbed the Woodland
Democrat, and it charges The Call with ignorance or
unfairness in making it. Other Democrats have
doubtless been equally disturbed, fo> the issue is one
of no little importance, and should the bill be held
up in the Senate the people are going to know the
reason why.
THE CANAL flND THE TREATY.
WHEN the Nicaragua canal bill was about to be
reported our dispatches from Washington an
nounced that the measure would be adopted
by the House, but that the Senate would hardly take
it up at this session. The accuracy of the forecast has
been confirmed by the events. The bill was passed
by. the House, but at the meeting on Monday of the
Senate Committee on Interoceanic Canals there was
manifest a strong opposition to reporting the bill
until action has been taken on the Hay-Pauncefote
treat}-.
If the faces of our local footpads look anything like
the pictures we see of them in some newspapers there
is small wonder that their victims fail to recognize
them. Faces like these behind the muzzle of a pistol
would rob anybody of his senses.
Editor The Callâ Dear Sir: The cry of
India still comes across the water, "God
has taken away our bread, -what shall
we do?" Every day's message seems more
desperate and hopeless. First it was
25,000,000, then 40,000,000 and 60.000,000 and
now it is 90,000,000 of people threatened
with starvation. All the world should re
spond to such a call. No little local sub
scription can meet the case at all. Shall
not California do somethingâ send a whole
cargo of wheat or several of them? IÂ»
anything 6f this nature being done? We
hear of subscriptions being taken on a
small scale, but what are these among so
many millions? There is abundance and
to spare in every part of California. Is
there not some way of using a part of
this abundance to save the lives of some
of these millions?
We have been requested by a vote of
our Yolo County Ministerial Union to
bring this matter to the notice of the
three leading San Francisco papers. The
Call, the Chronicle and the Examiner, and
ask what if anything can be done, and the
best, most practical way of gettin.tr at it?

Having made that taunting and brutal speech about
men who are fighting for his country's flag, Salis
bury went on to speak of the feeling against the Brit
ish among the people of continental Europe as "a
root of bitterness which I am unable to explain."
His Lordship has only to read his own speech with a
proper degree of intelligence in order to find an ex
planation of the root of bitterness which is against
the British everywhere. The poet who described :i
typical Englishman as "an oiled and curled Assyrian
bull" was himself an Englishman, and the phrase fit^
to perfection. Itis that brute bull nature showing
itself in the words and/the actions of British states
men that offends and irritates the instincts of man
kind. Solomon has said, "He who would have friends
must show himself friendly." ' When* the British lead
ers have shown themselves friendly to other nations
they will have some right to expect friends. Cer
tainly they can expect none when a Prime Minister
who has been trained as a diplomat speaks in the way
Salisbury has just spoken before the applauding
Tories of the Primrose League.
SALISBURY'S reference to what he called "the
intricate Irish problem" in his speech before the
Primrose League was one of those characteris
tic British utterances which have done so much to
make that problem a lasting and bitter one from
generation to generation. Something more than a
lack of tact was Necessary to lead a statesman to say
at this juncture that I he lesson to be learned from the
South African war is that the Irish people cannot be
trusted with self-government. In that war the Irish are
fighting for the empire, not with more courage perhaps
or more patriotism, but certainly with more distinc
tion, than the English themselves. It is an Irishman
who commands the armies of the empire, an Irish
man who has led the cavalry with most success, and
Irish regiments which have borne the brunt of the
fiercest fighting. Those facts are known to all, and
yet the British Premier says: "We now know better
than we did ten years ago what a risk it would be if
we gave a disloyal government in Ireland the power
of accumulating forces against this country."

The press of Idaho and Wyoming is speaking out in
the same way, and it is apparent that the leasing pol
icy -is a very live issue, that it is coming soon and
will come to stay.
The Arizona Range News says: "The determina
tion to incorporate option in the leasing law is an ex
cellent plan." The Tucson Daily Star says: "Leas
ing the grazing lands will create a fund for the build
ing of reservoirs, which will furnish water for the
irrigation of land which can be served by them. The
stockmen will secure better results under the leasing"
system. The reclamation of arid lands to agriculture
will create additional wealth-producing resources, fur
nish homes for farmers and add to the taxable wealth
of the country- The leasing policy will prove of great
value to stockmen, farmers and the Territory."
Professor Forbes of the University of Arizqna, in
hÂ» Arber day address this year, compared the beau
tiful wilderness of Arizona's plain? of years ago. when
ihry were covered with waving grasses, upon which
fc-d f?.t herds o{ deer .ind antelope, with the barren and
parched plains of to-day, the grass and plant life of
which has been fe<l nnd tramped out by overstocking
the ranges, resulting disastrously to the stockman
and the rancher. He Â«?.id: "Before this destruction
the fjraÂ«s roots kept the soil loose and porous. The
water evaporated but slowly from the loose and
shaded soil. It iÂ« evidently not the fault of nature,
but the miscrovemmer.t of man. that so great a.por
tion of the earth lies waste. But how may we expect
to remedy the desolation about us? Private control
of the Lands is the ? oli:tion, and I believe the only
onr. of this state of effairs. With secure tenure of
the ranges the stockman will have every inducement
to improve his territory. This has been the history
of the range in Texas, and sooner or later it will come
to pas? in Arizona."
All this iÂ« changed by the overfeeding that has fol
lowed the use of the ranges as commons. No one
has had any interest in protecting the forage. It, has
been gnawed out by the roots. The grassy plains are
now deserts. The soil has lost its porosit}-. The

SINCE the authorities "at Washington have in
structed the Collector of the Port to make an
examination before they leave the ship on
which they arrive of all Chinese seeking admission to
this country, even though they claim to be natives
of the United States, there is a good prospect that
the practice of importing coolies under that claim will
be broken up.
The neglect of a preliminary examination on ship
board has been a heavy handicap upon the officers
of the Government in making examinations in court,
since it permitted the Chinese to be landed and
coached as to what they should say when brought
into court A preliminary, examination immediately
upon their arrival here will put the coolies on record
and forestall coaching. It will furnish the law officers
with a basis of fact upon which to conduct the inves
tigations in the courts, and enable them more readily
to detect any false testimony which the professed na
tivÂ« born may be induced to give.
The law upon which the Washington authorities
base their instructions is that clause of the exclusion
act which provides: "That before any Chinese pas
sengers are landed from any such vessel the Collector
or his deputy shall proceed to examine such passen
gers, comparing the certificates with the list and with
the passengers, and no passenger shall be allowed to
land in the United States from such vessel in viola
tion of law."
Commenting upon the order Collector Jackson is
reported to have said: "I suppose you have heard
that The Call has won its fight. I will obey tfie com
mand of the Treasury. Native-born Chinese immi
grants will be examined on board the steamer by the
Chinese Bureau as usual. Native-born Chinese come
to this port without certificates of any kind, but they
will be examined, nevertheless."
With the victory won for the people by the earnest
and continued efforts of The Call, this Â£hase of cor
ruption practiced in connection with Chinese-immi
gration will be brought to an end. There will be
fewer Chinese added to the number of citizens here
after. The exposure made by The Call will put a stop
for a time at least to work of the ring which has been
importing natives with so much profit to its members.
It is to be borne in mind, however, that where there
is so much to be gained there will be always new
methods devised by unscrupulous men to defeat the
law. Continued vigilance is therefore necessary on
the part of the people, the press and the officials. The
law is now to be enforced, and it remains to be seen
that the enforcement is not perfunctory merely, but is
done with zeal and fidelity.-

By birth he is a Germanâ the son of a
German Consul who went to Baltimore
some fifteen years ago and later died,
leaving his son penniless and with no
other visible assets than a certain useful
quality which it wero unkind to call as
surance.
By trade he is an agent for champagne.
Ann by virtue of his liberal natural

He is a social diplomat.
He moves on practically no income in a
society composed of some of the richest
people in the world.
It may be surmised that this phenom
enal social success of a penniless German
from Baltimore Is due to his personality.
But, as a mutter of fact, he has
not an extraordinary personality. He
is about 30 years old. He is short and
not particularly slight. His eyes are blue,
his hair falr'and he has a square, smooth
shaven, rather heavy face, which becomes
attractive when he smiles. He is neither
graceful nor distinguished in appearance.
he has various engaging
traits. And one of them is an infinite
good nature which nothing has ever been
known to ruffle. Another is a sense of
humor. Nothing funny ever escapes him.
He lg also famed for his readiness at im

for his mastery, of the negro and'other
dialects.
And linally. he has a lisp. It Is claimed
by those who have coveted this particular

bought or acquired. Mr. Lehr's is inborn,
inimitable.

ENTERTAINER TO THE "400"
know not that, then it knows more of dog fights' than
of politics. The McKinley administration has done
what it could to foster and forward the great enter
prise, and if it be defeated or postponed the blame
will rest upon those who, while pretending to be sup
porters of the canal, have united with the railroad in
denouncing the administration for making the treaty.
The Kansas City platform should read: "Resolved,
That we insist upon the continued withdrawal of the
constitution from the eliminated blacks of our South
ern States and its extension to the blacks of Porto
Rico and the Philippines."
"Resolved, That while we shoot our own citizens
for asking rights already given them by the consti
tution and are not ashamed of it, we view with alarm
the refusal of the Republican party to extend the
same rights to people who never had them."
If they are as frank as Mr. Abbott says they are,
they should be frank in their platform.
THERE seem to be two fountain-heads of ex
pression in the Bryan party. Of course Colonel
Bryan himself is the principal head, the ever
flowing fountain of everlasting oratory. He has
waked more echoes and made the welkin ring oftener
than any other. He is the ever-recurring political
comet, with an orbit the center of which is the White
House. He flies off into the ample space of far New
England, or the remote valley of the Puyallup, and
in due time approaches the Executive Mansion again,
as comets do the sun, with a long tail of speech
streaking the political sky behind him.
The lesser fountain-head is on the shoulders of
Mr. Willis J. Abbott of Chicago. Willi3 slays with
the pen. He drops into manuscript, and what he
writes is sent out in paper matrices, for ready use in
the worshipful press which teaches that there were
no Democrats before Bryan and that^Abbott is his
prophet.
Mr. Abbott fulfills the spirit of the California sig
nature law. He signs what he says. No grim and
frowning statute is required to make him do it. He
loves to look upon his name in print, as the sighing
lover does to look into the liquid eyes of his sweet
heart. One of Mr. Abbott's late signed and circulated
articles is in the form of a decree of greater excom
munication against Cleveland, ex-Governor Campbell
and all their kind. Indeed it is to be feared by the
friends of those gentlemen that Abbott has no use
at all for them in his business. They have fallen un
der his displeasure. He is the party bouncer and
sends them sprawling into the street
Averting hi? face from them and all their works,
he raptly exclaims: "I see in my own party Bryan,
Williams, Altgeld, Towne and Tillman firmly hold

and that seems to be what is the matter with Mr.
Abbott's party. Tillman is accustomed to command
and is not ashamed of. the way he gets it.
In a speech in the Senate recently he describes the
means used in his State and its neighbors. to reach
and hold his place of influence and command. Find
ing themselves in the minority at the polls he said:
"We took the government away. We stuffed ballot
boxes. We shot them. We are not ashamed of it.
With that system â force, tissue ballots, etc. â we go^
tired ourselves. So we called a constitutional con
vention and we climated the colored people."
A man who wins by murdering his opponents is
likely to have influence and command among men
who admire that way of getting and keeping office.
A confessed ballot-box stufTer makes a fine figure at
the head of a national party. Mr. Abbott admires
him and compliments him, declaring that "the people
want to know what their leaders think," and that Till
man does "not usfc language to conceal thought."
Xo. indeed. He merely uses a gun and stuffs ballot
boxes to get into office, and brags about it in the
United States Senate.
Bryan and Senator Jones, chairman of his commit
tee, say that the constitution, "with a-11 its blessings,
immunities and privileges, is extended to the people
of the Philippines and Porto Rico," and raise a cry
about the Porto Rican tariff on the score of humanity.
Why not extend the constitution to the "eliminated"
people of South Carolina? Why not consult them as
to the relative humanity of being shot for voting
against Tillman or paying a small tariff?
Does Mr. Abbott regard ballot-box stuffing as one
of the immunities and blessings of the constitution?
He arraigns the ' Republican party for its theory
that the islanders are not under the constitution.
What good would it do them to be under the con
stitution if Tillman were among them and they re
ftifed to vote as he wished, and he had his gun and
his stuffing for the b:illot-box?

OF INTEREST TO THE
PEOPLE OF PACIFIC COAST
Focusing is sometimes a little difficult,
but the difficulty can be overcome by us
ing a candle flame. More Important, how
ever, is to know the exact point to focus
on. We are bound to use a comparatively
small stop to get definition, and thus
make longlsh exposures necessary, but a
little discrimination In selecting: the exact
point on which to focus will enable us to
attain sharp definition with the largest
possible stop, and thus attain the shortest
possible exposure.
Most camera users know that if they fo
cus on an object a certain distance from
the lens they find that objects J&oth in
front of it and behind It are sufficiently
sharp. The distance between these two
points Is the depth of focus of the lens.
By using a smaller stop we extend the
depth of definition In both directions. Here
comes a little problem: Given a near ob
ject and a distant one. where should we
focus to get the best definition and what
is the largest stop we must use? -;:.*.â¢
I will not bother going Into the mathe
matics of this, but the following table Is
compiled for the users of the ordinary 4x5
hand camera, a class which Includes, I
fancy, most of my readers:
Just a word about how to use the level.
The camera should be set up with one leg
of the tripod toward the object being
photographed, the other two to the rear,
bo that in working the photographer will
stand between them. Supposing the cam
era in position, if a circular level be used
on top of the back a little movement of
the front leg of the tripod will soon get
the bubble in the center, and when that
is accomplished the plate will be perpen
dicular.
With a straight level the work Is a lit
tle more complicated, at least to describe,
but in practice it is very easy. Begin by
placing the level on the back of the cam
era and pointing toward the lens; a slight
movement of the front leg and the bubble
may be made to go to the center. This
accomplished, turn the level half way
around, so as to He across the back, then
by moving the same front leg to one side
or another the camera can ue made level
in this direction. To make sure that all
Is right, turn the level to its original di
rection and make any final adjustment
that may be necessary. Any negative
now made with the camera will show per
pendicular lines as such and not lines fall
ing to one side or the other, as one too fre
quently sees In the average photograph
of buildings, whether the view be exterior
or Interior.
Another point deserving much consider
ation in all kinds of photography, but es
pecially in Interior work. Is the height of
the camera. Most people content them
selves by so placing the Instrument that
when focusing It will be convenient to
study the ground glass. If they only
knew a little of the principles of perspec
tive they would know that the height
of the camera during exposure is just
as important as its location otherwise. It
is impossible to travel over the field of
perspective In an article like this, but my
readers can demonstrate a certain fact
for themselves by exposing a couple of
plates on an Interior, one with the lens
about five and a half feet from the ground
and the other about three and a half
feet. In the one print the floor will look
as If pitched at a steep slope, while in the
other It will look more natural. The il
lustration shows this point In a minor de
gree. The lens. It is evident, was just a
few inches above the level of the top of
the mantel shelfâ that is, a medium height
âbut it would have given a more pleasing
effect had it been almost a foot lower.
pose, and this prevents ray producing the
ridiculous scenes and portraits that one
sees so often.

Missing Bark Dominion in a Southwester Off Vancouver Coast.
NEWS FROM THE
OCEAN AND THE
WATER FRONT
Reinsurance Rates Jumping
Up on. Overdue Bark
Dominion.
The Old Timer Has a Remarkable
History and Is Well Known
All Over the Pacific y
Coast. '
Reinsurance en the old wooden bark
Dominion took a jump from 30 to ZO per
cent yesterday. She is now out sixty
eight days from Tacoma for Sydney, N. S.
W.. but that fact has very little to do
with the jump in reinsurance, as many
a fast ship has taken eighty-five and
ninety days to make the same run. What
has scared the underwriters Is the news
that comes from Alaska and also the fact
that the Dominion went out in the face of
a southwester that kept the entire coast
ing fleet at sea from twenty to forty-flve
days.
The Dominion sailed from Tacoma on
March 4 with a cargo of lumber for Syd
ney. On March 30 the fishing steamer
Edith picked up in Wrangle Narrows a
lifeboat which had painted on its bow the
name "Dominion, Sydney." About the
middle of March a boat stove in at the
bows was picked up in Wreck Bay by the
Indians. It contained canned meats, wa
ter and bread. Near it was the name
board of a ship bearing the letters "Do
minion."
At first it was thought that the things
found in Wreck Bay were from the Bri
tish iron ship Dominion, which failed
from Honolulu for Puget Sound nearly a
year ago and has never been heard of
eince. This could not be, however, as
the ship Dominion did not carry a name
board, while the wooden bark Dominion
did. These facts are what have caused
the reinsurance on the vessel to take
such a sudden jump.
The old bark Dominion has had an
eventful career. She was built in Quebec
in Ifc75 and for a time ran between Canada
and England. Finally she reached the
Pacific Coast and for a time ran between
Puget Sound and San Francisco. One
day while T. P. K. Whitelaw, the wrecker,
was in Victoria, B. C, he had a chance to
buy the old vessel cheap and did so. After
fixing her up she was placed under the
Nicaraguan Hag and sailed from here for
Sydney. N. S. \V., in charge of Captain
Younneberg. The bark reached Australia
all right, but the captain first of all ran
her into debt and then sold her, pocketing
the money. That was the last Captain
Whitelaw ever saw of his money, his ship
or Captain Younneberg.
The Dominion was purchased by Cow
lishaw Bros, of \ Sydney and they once
more placed her under the British flag.
This move was disastrous, as the Inspect
ors of. Hulls in Sydney promptly con
demned the vessel. She was fixed up,
however, and finally passed muster for a
voyage from Newcastle, N. S. W.. to
Honolulu. On her way she sprang aleak
and once more reached Sydney, where
she sank at her moorings. She was raised
and again put in commission. This time
can modify the final result, but this is a
pure misapprehension. It is. however,
possible by local application to restrain
any part that is developing too rapidly.
For instance, since our light reaches us
from the sky, the floor, especially near a.
window, will be very fully exposed, and if
allowed to develop normally will be too
dense in the negative. This can be pre
vented by the local application of bro
mide in the early stages of development.
The operation is a very simple one. Dis
solve about tifty grains or potassium bro
mide in an ounce of water, and havÂ»
handy an ordinary moderate sized water
color brush; start development* and the
moment the high lights have made their
appearance remove the plate from the
tray and stand it on edge for a couple of
minutes to allow the surface to drain.
Now hold It in the hand and with the
brush apply the bromide solution to all
the parts you wish held back, such a*
noor, window and white objects. Allow
the solution to soak in for a couple of
minutes, and then proceed with develop
ment. Should you find you have restrained
too much, souk the piate in water foT a
minute, and then proceed with a fresh de
veloper.
It frequently happens that one think*
the development is all right, but after thÂ»
negative is fixed It Is found that somo
parts are too dense. This can be remedied
at once in a very simple manner by tha
local application of potassium ferricyan
lde or red prussiate of potashâ in fact, tha
reducer I described In the article on "Im
provement of Negatives." The hypo Is in
the film, therefore all we need to apply ia
the ferricyanide. A crystal the size of a
pea Is dissolved in a couple of ounces or
so of water, and the negative, after stand
ing on edge a couple of minutes to drain,
is hclu horizontally over a sheet of wnite
paper and the solution applied to the spots
with a brush. Action proceeds at once,
and the moment it has gone far enough
the negative Is held under the tap for a
second to wash the solution off. If a
careful inspection shows that more should
be done, repeat the application. When thÂ»
operation is complete return the negative
to the hypo bath for a few minutes. I
need scarcely say this procedure Is a val
uable one for all kinds of negatives and
subjects.
spring- up the shades and then give one
second's exposure.
By far the best views are those showing
one room opening off into another, as In
the illustration. The furniture should be
moved around as little as possible, but it
is wisdom to remove any very large arti
clse that may happen to be very near the
camera. Again, do not stow ail the be
longings of the house Into the field of
view, and be sparing in the amount of
carefully arranged sofa pillows, mando
lins ana similar articles you include. It
is far better to have things aa near as
possible to the normal condition they pre
sent when in actual use. Therefore it ia
perfectly good taste to have an open book
here, a work-basket there or a piece of
music on the piano rack.
Before making the exposure give some
consideration to the pictures on the walls.
Glass casts reflections and you must mako
sure that these do not reach the lens.
Place your eye In front of it and look at
each picture in turn, and if any one of
them happens to reflect light make a ball
of a piece of cloth and stuff It In behind
the frame, so as to chance the angle.
! It is hard to say how long to expose an
interior, as so much, depneds upon the
lighting, color of the objects, the plate and
the diaphragm used. One thing I do
knoiw, the average interior Is very much
underexposed. In an ordinary case, about
the middle of the day. with stop No. 16,
I should give from five to ten minutesâ
not seconds, as too many consider ample.
Develop as you would any other sub
ject. I am aware that many people believe
that by tinkering with the developer they

In the matter of equipment any ordinary
camera, whether it costs $2 or $50. can be
ured, but it must be confessed It Is fre
quently an advantage In cramped situa
tions to have a wide-angle lensâ that la
to say one that Includes a larger field
than the lenses ordinarily supplied with
most cameras. In addition to the regular
outfit I would recommend the purchase,
of a spirit level, which can bo got either
in circular form, about the size of a quar
ter, or In the ordinary straight form, one
about three Inches long being a conveni
ent size. I bought one of the latter kind
seven years ago. and it has reposed in my
left vest pocket ever since, and I find It
one of the handiest tools I carry. If you
are hang-ing a picture there Is no doubt
about getting it perpendicular, for all you
have to do ia to apply the level to the
frame. The level is Just as useful when
you are fastening a bracket to the wall.
And so In hundreds of other cases â In fact,
I use it almost every day. In making
negatives, no matter whether landscape,
portrait or interior, I level the cameraâ
that la, I make sure that the plate is per
pendicular In both directions before I ex

THE CALL'S
HOME STUDY CIRCLE
The central figures In the above table In
bold type show the focus point: the num
bers to the left and right are the near
and far points. The use of the table can
best be exemplified by an example. "We
will suppose the subject to be the interior
shown In the illustration. The nearest ob
ject Is . the chair, which probably was
about six feet away, while the most dis
tant object Is the grandfather's clock at
the far end of the second room, probably
twenty feet away. We wish every object
to be sharp, but at the same time with the
largest possible stop. We look at our
table for the numbers 6 and 20 In the first
and third columns. The nearest we can
find are 6 and 27 under stop No. 16, so if
we set our focusing scale at ten feet, as
indicated by the heavy type, and use stop
No. 16â the second largest of most hand
camera lensesâ we can make the exposure
perfectly confident that everything will be
sharp. Had we. focused on the chair we
would have had to use a very much
smaller stop to get the fame definition.
We may - now consider a few minor
points. In selecting a point of view avoid
if possible Including a window in the field
of the lens, for if you do you will prob
ably find that the window will show sim

will likely have quite a halo around It. ob

WHEAT â Chicago opened rather firmer on the
crop report from Michigan showing a condition
of 54. Later on all grains became weak, owing
to foreign advices, fine weather and a nrxierate
demand. Business fell off pending the Govern
ment report, but the shipping demand was
rather better at Uie close. Provisions tvera
steady and buying by the leaders made the
market look better.
The local market was very dull, with a slight
decline In spot quotations. Â¦ .
The Government report, received later In the
day, gave the area of winter wheat May 1 at
S6.585.C0O acres, or 11.8 per cent less than the
area estimated last fall. The reduction In acre
age in the principal - States, owing to Ii\sstan
fly and winter killing. Is estimated as follows:
Indiana, 1.608.000 acres; Ohio. 969.000; Michigan,
317.000; Pennsylvania, 158,000; Illinois, 137,000.
The average of the acreage remaining in cul
tivation May 1 was SS.9 per cent, which Is 6.2
per cent above the average for the past ten
years.

NEW YORK. May IB.â The active liquidation
of two previous days tn tfce stock market wu
relaxed to-day, leaving the largely extended
ehcrt Interest on the defensive. Yesterday's
final recovery gave an impetus to the demand
for Americans en the London market, which
lifted price* for the opening here. There was
Borne rllght outside demand through commis
sion houses, showing that there is an element
nhich is watching the market closely for In
dications that it has turned. The opening
etroegth from these causes quickly gave way
under the attack by the bears, who used the
statement of St. Paul's earnings for the first
week in May. This statement, showing a de
crease from last year for the first time in
Siar.y months, did in fact have a strong in
fluence on i>entlir.ent- It wÂ«s a forcible re
minder of the fears which have found ex
preseion for e<>me time past In Wall street that
the reaction In the iron market and in gen
eral business would inevitably lead to a fall
ing off ia ra'.lrcad earnings. The bears pro
fesstd apprehension over the pessimistic tone
of L<jrd Salisbury's fcl>eech last night. Quite
liberal buying for London account served to
counteract this argument, the arbitrage houses
estimating the buying for London account as
Mgh as 40.00* shsres. Hut the most effective
succor for the bears came from a break of
over i points tn Tobacco and from persistent
heaviness la Sugar. Prices very generally
drirted bark to last night's level or b^low but
*t no time during the day did the pressure of
!lQui(!atton become severe, and the bears found
ClffictiJty in getting stocks whenever they bid
for them. The absence cf pressure prompted
some of the small pools to resume operations
ii'iiiMy that tn Missouri Pacific, and that stock
wÂ«i bid up duriiur the day nea.rly 2 points I
The co^â¢*^lng of short contracts gave notabl*
strength also to the Atchlsons, the Pacific and
Ixiulsvllle. The upward movement in the trunk
lines we* oot aa marked aa In other stocks
Tbe metal stocks were Inclined to be firm all
day, though they were not very actively traded
tn. American Steel and Wire led the move
ment, both its stocks rising over 3 points on
rumors that Federal Steel Interests wouM be !
represented in the board of directors. There i
was some slight apprehension that gold might
go out on Saturday to England in response to
yesterday's advance in the Bank of England's
raying price J'or American eagles, but the
exchange experts are generally agreed that
told exports to London â¢ offer no profit under
existing conditions. The local money market
m;lm not quotcbly changed to-day, but the eui
plus of the banks Is declining.
Bonds recovered in sympathy with stocks.

NEW YORK. May lO.-Whlle trading was not
very active In the market for metals to-day
price changes were numerous. Cables were
again unsatisfactory from London, and this
together with the local pressure to sell causeci
a general weaker undertone. Lead prices wprÂ»
reduced 15 points by the New. York Smelting
and Refining Company, closing weak n tone
at $4 25 bid and $4 30 asked. Tin was some 30Â©

weak at $23 80 bid and $29 asked. Pig

Nn.v York Grain and Produce.
Spring plowing is more or less late in almost
every State In which its condition is a matter
of any especial significance. The only notable
exceptions are Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Illi
nois. Kansas. Missouri and Arkansas. The
work already done In the country at large is
estimated at C8.4 per cent for the total con
templated, the proportion usually done by May
1 being about 75 per cent of the whole.
The average condition of spring pasture was
91.3. against M.5 on May I, 1S99; 91.2 on 'May
1. 189S. and 90.9, the mean of the May averages
for the last ten year?.
The average condition of meadow mowing
lands on May 1 was 90. s. against S4.9 on May
1, 1S99; i>2.9 on May 1. ISO*, and 91.3. the mean
of the May averages of the last ten years.
For the are* remaining under cultivation
the average condition on May 1 was 8S.9 per
cent. While this average is 6.2 points above
the mean of the averages of the last ten
years, and has been exceeded only three times
In fifteen years, it must be remembered that
the acreage plowed up, cut for forage (except
in California, where it is not yet definitely
ascertainable) or otherwise abandoned, has
been entirely eliminated. The high averages
of condition reported last month for Kansas,
Missouri. Texas and other more or less im
portant wheat-producing States that have es
caped tlio ravages of the fly have been fully
maintained, and on May 1 nearly one-half of
the entire winter wheat acreage remaining un
der cultivation reported a full normal or still
higher condition. The average condition of
winter rye on May 1 was SS.5, as compared
with 85.1 <m May 1. 1S99. 94.5 on May 1, 1S9S,
nnd $9.7 the mean of the May averages for
the last ten years. Pennsylvania and New
York, with 42.1 per cent of the total winter
rye acreage of the country, report conditions
11 points and 4 points respectively below their
ten-year averagex. Kansas, which ranks third
in the scale of acreage, reports the high
average condition of 107. the highest average

CLOSING,
NEW YORK, May 10.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablerram says:
There were weak *r>ots in the markets here to,
day, but taken as a whole the markets were
hardy. The cheering Influences were the news
of General Roberts' continued advance and the
good bank return. Bear operators were dis
posed also to olosÂ« before the settlement, par
ticularly their commitments in mines. Funds,
however, continued to droop, affected adversely
by the money outlook. Americans opened firm,
the low level at which they stood yesterday at
tracting moderate purchases, both for lxmdon
and tbÂ« Continent, but New York made only
slight response to the rise here and the close
was undecided. Baltimore and Ohio reacting
especially. Tintos were % off owing to the
weakness in copper, whilo Anacondas rose to
New York parity. The bank received Â£50,000
gold from Norway and lost Â£10.000 to South
America. Bills and call money are inclined to
be easier. The bank did a fair business in dis
counts. There was less talk of gold shipments
from America, despite the half-penny rise in
the buying price oT eagles, as it la thought that
the Bank of England will not pay interest on
Bold in transit. Silver was 29 9-16d at the close
on Indian coinage orders. â¢

WORKMEN'S HONORS TO
TWO GRAND OFFICERS
Mrs. Cetti was until lately employed by
Mrs. W. H. Crocker as a maid. The
woman's husband was then In this city.
He had a theory that It was ridiculous
for a man to work, especially when ho
had a wife. At the solicitation of her
maid Mrs. Crocker gave the man money
enough to go back to his relatives In
Paris. He went to Paris, and his rela
tives, who are prosperous bourgeois, re
ceived him so coldly that he hied to the
cemetery and blew out his brains on the
tomb of his ancestors. He left for a leg
acy to his wife an infallible system of
beating the races.
A cablegram announcing his death was
received by Mrs. Cettl, and she became
almost insane. Mrs. Crocker, who took
an interest in the woman, did a great
deal to comfort her, but when letters ar
rived, written before death by the hus
band, in which he told of his Intent to
die, and described his system of betting
on the races, Mrs. Cetti relapsed. Mrs.
Crocker provided a home for Mrs. Cetti
with the Young Woman's Christian Asso
ciation and had her well cared for, but
Mrs. Cetti left town and went to Stock
ton, where she committed suicide.

persons and premises of the five afflicted,
with the disease have been closely quar
antined, and local physicians are of the
opinion that no spread of the infection
Is to be anticipated.

registering at the Commercial Hotel last
night from San Francisco, committed sui
cide this morning by inhaling illuminating
gas through a hose. She left a note to the
hotel proprietor expressing sorrow at put
ting him to trouble, und asking that her
body be allowed to remain in the Morgue
as short a time/as possible, as no one
would call for her. She stated that her
husband was dead and that she could not
live without him. Among the woman's
effects were found endearing letters from
her husband, dated Paris, France, and
two letters, one from a cousin of her
husband, and another from a friend, gave
the details of the suicide of her husband
by shooting at Paris on the 22d of April
last. A cablegram, dated April 23, con

"FRAT" SOCIETIES
KEEP OPEN HOUSE
Hamlin and Ramage had gene out this
morning to attend a family who were 111
in the canyon. While returning to Hay
wards the horses were crossing a nar
row plank bridge, unguarded by any rail
ing. One of the horses shied and stepped
into a hole. This threw the horse down
and carried the other horse over. The
buggy swerved and was tipped off the in
secure planking before the driver, who
was Ramage, could save himself. Down
the team and its occupants plunged Into
the stream below. Then It was a fight
to extricate themselves from the kicking
horses, who had demolished what was
left of the buggy.
That the accident was not fatal ap
peared almost miraculous. The occupants
of the vehicle were pitched headlong into
the stream below and were tangled up
among the horses and the wreckage of
the buggy. Ramage is a very heavy man
and his escape from death was even more
marvelous than that of his companion.
They managed to scramble out on the
bank of the creek and save one of the
horses, but the other was so badly en
tangled in the harness and debris that
It could not be hauled out.
A double team of horses driven to a
buggy In which were Dr. O. D. Hamlin of
this city and Town Marshal W. J. Ram
age of Haywards plunged off a bridge In
Millera Canyon, four miles out of town,
this morning, falling twenty feet into the
creek below. The creek was running ten
feet of water. One horse was drowned,
the other so badly injured that it will be
useless for work, the buggy was wrecked
and Marshal Ramage barely escaped with
his life, suffering a broken collar-bone,
eprained ankle and bad bruises. Dr.
Hamlin was bruised, but saved himself
from fractured limbs.

OAKLAND. May 10.â Congressman Vic
tor Metcalf expects to leave this city for
Washington, D. C, on Saturday morning.
When the bank paid Its taxes a protest
was filed that the suit might be properly
brought against the Assessor as soon as
the second installment of taxes had been
liquidated. According to the valuation
placed upon the bank properties by
Garthwalte the taxes would have
amounted to $2006 26. but the taxes paid
upon the assessment by Dalton were
S1M95 22. Judgment is asked for the differ
ence between these amounts. County As
sessor Dalton holds that the bonds held
by banks are assessable and the courts
will be Invited* to adjudicate the contest.
In making his return to the Assessor
last year Cashier Garthwalte of the bank
omitted these Hems, which were subse
quently placed upon the roll by the As
sessor. The bank's contention Is that this
was an illegal act. and that It Is enti
tled to the return of all money paid for
taxes on any property placed on the roll
by the arbitrary action of Assessor.
The Oakland Bank of Saving3 has
brought suit against Alameda County to
recover J742S taxes paid upon bonds and
franchises assessed to It last year. The
action will be a test of the County As
sessor's right to make an assessment ar
bitrarily when a statement of property
has been filed with him. The question is
also involved If the $3s>4,000 worth of bonda
held by the bank are assessable, as well
as $3000 in franchises and J5000 placed aa
safe deposit and vault values.

ISABELLE UNDERWOOD.
THE first appearance here of Miss Isa
belle Underwood will be on next
Monday evening at the Grand
Opera-house when she will be seen
In "The I.ady Slavey." Her opportuni
ties have hitherto been confined to the
rendition of solo?, but even this proved
her to be the possessor of a rich and
highly cultivated contralto voice.
Miss Underwood belongs to one of the
most celebrated and historical families in
the East. Her grandfather wus Governor
Ol the State of Delaware. She received
her education In Chicago, and in one of
the most exacting. competitions- ever held
in the Conservatory in that city carried
off the diamond studded medal. She was
a prominent society belle in the Windy
City.
Miss Underwood was at one time the
principal contralto soloist in St. James*
Catholic Cathedral in Chicago, where the
fame of her singing attracted attention of
George Fair, the well-known impresario,
who engaged her for leading contralto
roles in his company. Sho is not only a
brilliant vocalist, but a graceful and fas
cinating actress. Her debut here is des
tined to be a fashionable event on ac
count of her family connections and
friends in this city. Her uncle is C. W.
Hinchcllffe, assistant manager of the
Sunset Telephone Company.

The California Schuetzen Club met last

Captain Schuemann adjourned for a
month. . .
GENIAL Fred Schuemann, who for
several years past has been the
manager for the California Schuet
zen Club of their Schuetzen Park,
near this city, died at" the residence of
Captain Kuhls In this city Wednesday.
The deceased was a member of
nearly every rifle club en this coast, and
was known to every marksman In Cali
fornia. To his management must be
given the credit of making Schuetzen
Park the popular place which It is to-day.
He was a member of the Baker Vereln
and Morse Lodge No. 259. I. ,O. O. F., be

George C. Pardee opposed the I views
maintained by Charles Page concerning
the fortification of the canal by the United
States. He considered it unwise and un
patriotic, to provide legislation or to rati
fy a treaty that would enable foreign
countries to take advantage in time - of
war of- a canal constructed by the United
States that would assist them to. ravage
the Pacific Coast of the United States.
England had the Suez canal open, theo
retically, to the world; but the fact could
not be overlooked that it was under the
guns of Malta and .Gibraltar. Brief re
marks were made by Rev. Dr. Stebblns,
Rev. Dr. Clampett and Rev. Dr. Hiral.
. Charles' Page spoke of the canal In its
International aspect and maintained that
it would be a breach of international
faith to pass a bill providing for the for
tification of the big ditch in the interest
of the United States, considering the pro
visions of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty.
F. W. Dohrmann said the opening of the
canal would bring the Pacific Coast into
keener, competition with , the East for the
trade of the islands of the Pacific and the
Orient than now exists. On the other
hand he foresaw that the products of Cal
ifornia would be brought nearer to the
markets of Europe. Great impetus to Im
migration would be given when great
steamships were starting from Kuropean
ports for California every two or- three
days. These Immigrants would bring
skill, labor and energy to the Pacific
Coast, as they had to the Atlantic coast
of the United States.
Last evening the Unitarian Club of Cali
fornia celebrated its ninth annual "ladies'
night" at the' Merchants' Club with a
banquet and speeches. The banquet* hall
was profusely decorated. The subject
principally discussed was the Nicaragua
canal from various points of view. Shel
don Kellogg presided.

Ladies' Nig-ht Celebrated by a Ban-
nin and Frank Dsffendorf Were
the Culprits.
Confirmation of the allegation that Wil
liam Cronin and Frank Deffendorf, his
companion, were the two men who com
mitted the safe robbery at the Benicia
Postofflce last Saturday night was re
ceived yesterday morning by Captain
Seymour. Ex-Postmaster F. P. Wyman
telephoned that the revolver found on
Cronin. and which Deffendorf claimed he
gave to Cronin, was the one stolen from
the Postofflce at the time of the robbery.
It belonged to him and was left in the
possession of his successor when he re
tired. The drill found on Cronin fitted
the hole in the sufe exactly. The case
will be taken before the Federal Grand
Jury to-day.
There Is no doubt In the minds of the
police that the two men also robbed
Wells-Fargo's office at San Leandro on
the night of April 30. Persons who saw
a tall young man and a shorter and older
man in San- Leandro that night will be
asked to call at the City Prison to see If
they can identify Cronin and Deffendorf.
The two men appeared before Judge
Mogan yesterday on the additional charge
of Having burglars' tools in their posses
sion. Deffendorf pleaded guilty, but
Cronin put in a plea of not guilty. The
cases were continued .until to-morrow.

tion and he was elected. Captain Warren'
then nominated Captain George Filmer,
and he went through Â¦without opposition.
Captain Thomas J. McCreagh was nomi
nated by Captain Filmer, and he too was
elected without opposition. It will proba
bly be decided that the majors shall hold
rank according to length of service, which
will keep them in the order in which they
were nominated.
\\ hen Duboce was nominated Captain
Filmer and Captain Sutllffe were named
as tellers, but SutlifTe immediately declin
ed. He eaid that the election was illegal
anyway, because the necessary ten days
had not elapsed since the notification. His
protest was disregarded and he asked
that the secretary be- ordered to make
i note of It. Lieutenant Curzons was ap
einted a teller in his place.
After the election the new officers were

surface.

Gray got Into the buggy with Mrs. Lent,
intending to drive her safely to her home.
His ability to hold the horse when he was
on the ground was greater though than
when he was in the buggy. The frantic
animal had not been entirely subdued by
Gray's valorous efforts and when that
gentleman and Mrs. Lent got into the ve
hicle the beast again became unmanage
able and started on a run toward the con
servatorv.
Park policemen who had finally arrived
on the scene gave chase and after the
horse had knocked down a bicyclist they
managed to capture him. Mrs. Lent then
got into George Knight's, buggy and was
taken home by him. Another man got
into Mrs. Lent's vehicle with Gray and
the two succeeded In driving the crazy
horse to the stable.
The man who was run over is Jeremiah
Geary of 306 Guerrero street. Drs. Bun
nell and Roche found that he had simply
sustained some bruises and he was sent
home. â¢, . -

animal dashed away across the green
sward.
The horse had run about 100 yards, with
people scurrying to get out of the way,
when it struck an old man who was not
quick enough to get to a place of safety.
He was knocked senseless and a crowd
gathered around him at once, it being
thought he was dead. Some of the people
present raised him up and laid him under
the shade of a bush. He was subsequently
taken to the City Receiving Hospital.
After running over the old man the
horse continued on to the children's play
ground and dashed up the sloping em
bankment by which it is surrounded.
Here the buggy was overturned and the
two ladies thrown violently on to the
lawn.
At this point a hand was taken in the
affair by IX C. Gray of 107 Powell street,
who ran in, grabbed the horse's bridle and
for a time stopped his mad racings. It
was found that neither of the ladies was
hurt, but Miss Lent was so badly fright
ened that she could hardly stand and was
sent to her home at once In a carriage.
These two ladies were watching the polo
game being played by the Burlingame
teams, when the music discoursed by the
band caused their horse to become res
tive. Mrs. Lent, who was driving, tried to
<juiet the bsast, but he continued to fret
and finally commenced to plunge. Mrs.
Lent held him down as long as she could,
but her strength finally gave out and the

â¢worth Wipe Out a Native
Son.
Hong Fun, an alleged native of the
United States, came up before United
States Court Commissioner Heacock yes
terday for examination in habeas corpus.
By the time Assistant United States At
torney Marshall B. Woodworth and the
Commissioner got through with him and
his witnesses the Mongolians were un
certain whether Hong Fun was born In
the Palace Hotel or on a kopje in the
Transvaal.
The Commissioner ordered Fun remand
ed to the custody of the United States
Marshal and will recommend to Judge de
Haven that the coolie be deported.
This was a difficult case, the petitioner
being among those who had not been re
quired to make a statement on board the
steamer on which he arrived from China,
but skillful cross-examination, guided by
a thorough knowledge of the Chinese
penchant for mendacity, won the day and
Fun cannot have a vote.
ANOTHER YELLOW LIAR
EXPOSED IN COURT
i Â¦Â¦Â¦.*. ."- f *
The steamer Coptic is scheduled to re
turn to China at 1 o'clock this afternoon.
She has on board more than 400 Chinese
coolies, many of whom have no right to
admission to the United States. A ma
jority of the Mongolians on the Coptic
came here with 'the understanding that
the Chinese ring in this city still possessed
its remarkable influence, and that landing
in the United States was a mere formality
to be finished in a few days. The expose
made by The Call has made the traftic in
Chinese hazardous and to a marked de
gree precarious. The members of the
ring are acting with more caution than be
fore, and it is not likely that they will
appeal to the Federal courts to prevent
many of the coolies from being sent back
to China at the expense of the Pacilic
Mail Steamship Company.
Unless some definite and immediate ac
tion be taken by the Federal officials these
400 Chinese merchants, students, tourists
and native sons will be marched from the
ship to the detention shed on the Mail
dock, there to remain indefinitely. Once
in this shed boarding house of the Pa
cific Mail Steamship Company these Chi
nese will be visited by their friends and
coached in the perjured testimony which
is designed to win them a landing in thu
United States. Paid agents of the Chinese
ring will be allowed to visit these men
contrary to law and tell them what they
shall do when they appear for final ex
amination.
Does Collector of the Port John P. Jack
son intend to permit these 400 Chinese to
land in San Francisco, or will he order
them back to China? Will he allow the
Pacific Mail Steamship Company to in
crease its illegitimate revenue to the enor
mouse extent of $6000 a month?
-If Collector of the Port John P. Jackson
permits these hundreds of Chinese to land
from the Coptic it will be Interesting to
watch what fiction will be taken by-
United States District Attorney Frank L.
Coombs, whose duly It is to see that
aliens are not illegally landed at this port.
There are now in the detention shed at
the Mail dock scores of Chinese who ar
rived here on the China, Doric and Nippon
Maru. Under the fiction of the law these
Chinese are "temporarily" but not in
definitely detained on the dock. It is a
matter of public interest to know how
long these Chinese are to remain on the
dock a. menace to the city and its people.
The departure of the Coptic to-day there
fore will be significant in indicating the
condition of the Chinese traffic in San
Francisco after an exposure has been
made.
