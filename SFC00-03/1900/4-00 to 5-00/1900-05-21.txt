LONDON, May 21, 3:10 a.m.â Displayed in the most conspicuous style in ttie Daily Express is the dominant war news of the
morning:
"We have the best reason for stating that in the last twenty-four hours a telegram has been received at the Foreign
Office, addressed personally to the Prime Minister, from President Kruger, proposing terms of peace. The exact .terms of the
message cannot be stated, but we believed it is couched in an exceedingly humble strain. It is inconceivable, of course, that
Lord Salisbury can have sent any reply except the one that stands ready on the lip of every Britonâ unconditional surrender.
A special dispatch from Kroonstad says that General de Wet has sent word that he is prepared to surrender conditionally
with his entire command.
The War Office has announced that Lord Roberts has not yet received official information of the relief of Mafeking. The
following is the text of Lord Roberts' dispatch:

king has been effected.

line from Boshof to Bloemfontein. A field cornet and eighty-six burghers surrendered at Boshof yesterday.,
"While at Hoopstad Methuen secured 250 rifles and between 400,000 and 500,000 rounds."
A dispatch to the Daily Telegraph from Mequatlings Nek, dated May 16, says: "General Brabant is reported to have
captured 1 500 Boers at Clocolan."
A dispatch to the Daily Mail from Lourenzo Marques, dated Sunday, says: "On Thursday the entire Boer force around
Mafeking, including the guns, was captured by the British."

gone to the front.
A Cape Town correspondent reasserts
that the Irish-American ambulance corps
from Chicago suffered heavily during the
fighting at Kroonstad, and that United
States Consul Hay had protested vainly
to President .Kruger against using the
corps on the fighting line.
General Buller Hesitates.
General Buller is in front of Laings Nek
hesitating to attack positions of enormous
natural strength. The reports that the
Boers have blown up portions of the tun

Special Dispatch to The Call.
ST. JOSEril, Mich.. May 20.â All rec
ords were broken to-day, when ninety
seven couples, most of them elopers from
i Chicago and Milwaukee, were married.
The local Justice of the Peace had his
hands full, but the most interest centered
around the home of the pastor of one of
the churches. There couples stood in
line awaiting their turn.
As the hour for the morning service
drew near the pastor announced to the
waiting line that he would return imme
diately after dismissing his congregation
and finish his work. Protests immediately
filled the air. Those who had stood in
line for a long time became vehement In
their language. They said they had
money to pay the fee and did not believe
in being married except by a minister;
but if the performance was to be Inter
rupted they would.be obliged to go to a
Justice of the Peace. The pastor was per
suaded to send his wife to dismiss the
congregation, and the good work went on
until 4 o'clock this afternoon, when the
last couple were married in time to catch
the last Chicago boat. .

was startled by the sound of a pistol shot,
screams and the splintering of glass. He
ran into Miss Ralph's room and there be
held an exciting scene.
The woman who had so narrowly es
caped death was clinging desperately with
"both hands to "the rig&f wrist "cf the
angry wife, whose hand clutched the still
smoking revolver. The women swayed
back and forth as they straggled for pos
session of the weapon. Mrs. Sawyer all
the time fiercely striving to get another
shot at her rival. The bullet had gone
past the head of Miss Ralph, the pistol be
ing held so close that the powder burn3
already mentioned had been made, passed
through a gas globe and into the wall near
the ceiling on the further side of the room.
Gillespie at once seized the revolver and
dragged Mrs. Sawyer away. Balked In
her efforts to avenge in blood the wrongs
she claimed to have suffered, the mad
dened >wife poured forth imprecations on,
the head of Miss Ralph until she was ex
hausted. Then she departed.
"I had a right to kill Mattie Ralph."
said Mrs. Sawyer yesterday, "and am sor
ry 7 I did not succeed in my attempt. I
have suffered great wrong from her. For
three years she has been usurping tho
affections of my husband. I have only
known of their intimacy for a year, and
during that time I have pleaded many
times â¢with her to have nothing more to do
with him. Finally I could endure it no
longer and gave her warning, but she did
not heed it. I have been a good wife to
him. and he would never have neglected
me but for. her.
"I knew when he stayed away from mo
Wednesday night that he was with her.
He had prepared to go to Los Angeles tho
next day. Thursday morning I watched
the Gillespie house and saw him come out
of it. Then I went up. dptermined to kill
her. I am sure Mr. Gillesple did not know
Sawyer went up there."
Mrs. Sawyer says her husband went to
Los Angeles Thursday afternoon by
steamer and made arrangements for her
to come to him this week with their littlo
girl. He promised her he would never
again seek the company of Miss Ralph.
The injured wife talks with the resigned
composure of one who has suffered so
much as to care little for what may hap
pen to her. She said she did not care
whether or not she was arrested.
Miss Ralph, who is Â¦well spoken of bv
Mr. Gillesple, denies any Intimacy with
Sawyer, and says his wife's jealousy 13
entirely unfounded. She says Mrs. Saw
yer is subject to "dreams." Miss Ralph
announces that she will not prosecute
Mrs. Sawyer, being too thankful for her
escape from death.
WITH avowed murderous intent
Mrs. Joseph Sawyer of 120
Eleventh street fired a shot from
a 38-callber revolver at Miss
Mattie Ralph last Thursday morning in
the room of the last named at 119 Ninth
street. r'-MIss Ralph had "a narrow* escape
from death. That the bullet did not
reach the intended mark is due to the fact
that the two women were engaged in a
desperate struggle at the time the shot
was fired, Miss Ralph having grappled
with the woman who wanted to send her
out of the world. As It was her neck and
nightgown were burned by the powder
from the pistol.
The cause of the shooting was mad
Jealousy on the part of Mrs. Sawyer be
cause of her husband's attentions to Miss
Ralph. Mrs. Sawyer calmly say3 she Is
sorry her bullet did rot accomplish the
work intended for it. She says she has suf
fered wrong for three years at the hands
of Miss Ralph, and after repeatedly warn
ing her to have nothing more to do with
Sawyer had made up her mind to kill
her.
Miss Ralph is forewoman at L*. Horo
vltz's, 751 . Market street. Sawyer is a
stereotyper, and up to a short time ago
was foreman in his department for one
of the evening papers. He lost his posi
tion, but secured another one a few days
ago in Los Angeles, where he is at the
present time.
Mrs. Sawyer's desperate attempt to
kill Miss Ralph, which would doubtless
have succeeded had not the last named
been, heavier and stronger than her as-:
sailant, occurred between 5 and ft o'clock
in the morning. The aggrieved wife
awoke Landlord Gillesple at that hour
and asked him in an unexcited and
natural tone of voice where Miss Ralph's
room was. His place being an entirely re
spectable one, in which people were not
usually sought for purposes of slaugh
ter. Mr. Gillespie promptly informed the
visitor that Miss Ralph occupied room
No. 9. He then returned to his bed to
resume his interrupted slumber. Mrs.
Sawyer went to the door of No. ,9 and
hammered on it with her fist or the butt
of the revolver, It is not known which,
but at any rate she hammered noisily.
There was no answer, and, beating
harder, she shouted:
"Open the door, or I'll break it down."
Miss Ralph must have thought the door
was being attacked with a sledge ham
mer and that the threat would be carried
out. for she opened it.
| Gillespie, alarmed by the racket, had by
this time got into his .clothes and started
for the scene of the disturbance, when he
likely to serve four years more, yet they
are satisfied that more than usual cars
must be taken In providing for the Presi
dential succession.
Usually the Vice Presidency has been
thrown as a sop to the defeated faction.
This will not 'be the case this year. ThÂ»
Vice President, it is said, will be nomi
nated with equal reference to his fitness
for the Presidency from an Ohio stand
point, his ability to acceptably presido
over the Senate and his strength and pop
ularity with voters. This may explain, so
"Washingtonians hint, the recent lack of

from Washington with great emphasis,
and the President mado it a point to show
himself in public frequently. He was seen
to possess great physical vigor, but his
appearance was that of a man who had
been and was undergoing a great mental
strain.

miles south of Luzon, from which it Is
separated by San Bernardino Channel,
and less than a day's steaming from Ma

due to the fact that it is very sparsely

wife and the first mate. These advices
report the trial of the mutineers and their
execution by native officials of Mindoro
Island, one of the largest of the Philip
pine group. Though their countrymen
are at war with the United States, these
simple-minded islanders resolved to pun
ish piratical acts against merchant ves

American troops, and the action of the
natives was taken upon their own in

Rev. Lord M. Cecil, a son of the Premier,
preaching yesterday in Gray's Inn Chapel,
London, before the Australian Federation
delegates and other notables, referred to
the demonstrations o*^ violence and said:
"The popular enthusiasm prevailing
throughout the country Is dangerous. The
line between good and evil is soon over
run by the unthinking crowd. The out
burst Is evil in so far as it is the same
spirit which animated the Roman crowds
in the Coliseum while the gladiators pur
sued each other to the death; but it is good
in 6o far as It is a protest against one of
the greatest evils of the ageâ the love of
money."
Special prayers of thanksgiving were
offered yesterday in the churches of the
United Kingdom. The Lord Bishop of
London, Dr. Mandell Crelghton, 'Â¦- who
preached before the Queen at Windsor,
alluded to the relief of Maf eking, and
clergymen generally found in the event
their topic for the day.
Details of the relief are still wanting,
the military authorities being without dis
patches. Lord Roberts \ wires that he
knows of the relief only through a press
agency. Lord Laru>downe, however, an
nounces that the War Office expects di
rect nem to-day.
The situation in the field has changed
but little since Friday. Lord Roberts'
troops are in fine form and abundantly
supplied.- Indications seem to point to an
early movement. His cavalry, riding over
several hundred square miles in a semi
circle bewond Kroonstad. have received
the submission of hundreds of Free Stat
ers. It now appears that the De "Wet who
offered to surrender with 1000 men was not
the well-known General De Wet, but Com
mandant De Wet. He stipulated that his
men should be allowed to return to their
farms. Lord Roberts replied that the sur
render must be unconditional.
The Botha who was captured the other
day was Philip Botha. Those surrender
ing are solemnly warned that If they
break the oath of neutrality their houses
will be burned and their farms confis
cated. Such as do yield do it for pro
tection.
Reports flow into Lord Roberts at head
quarters of the discouragement of the
Boers and of their Â¦willingness, even In the
case of the Transvaalers, to give up.

ister Wu is confident that when Congress
becomes acquainted with the facts it will
not enact any legislation prohibitory of
the admission of Chinese into the archi

against the exclusion orders which Gen
eral Otis issued, but his protests . have
been unheeded by the State Department.
Minister Wu strongly objects to the ex
tension of the Chinese exclusion laws to
the Philippines; In his notes he has shown
the great part played by his countrymen
in the development of the islands, and he
believes the United States will be â¢ the
loser if it should debar them.
One of the Minister's subordinates has
been sent to Manila to investigate the sit

migration, and when he has concluded he
will go to Peking to lay the facts before
the Tsung Li Yamen. It is likely that the
State Department will comply with the
Minister's request to send his -notes- to
Congress, but this may not be done at thla
session. No legislation whatever for the
Philippines will be recommended or enact

WASHINGTON. May 20.â Under cover
of an annual report on the trade relations
of Germany Consul-General Mason at
Berlin hr.s published In the volume of
Comaerciul Relations issued from the
linreatt of Foreign Commerce, State De
partment, some exceedingly Important
statements relative to the present condi
tions governing trade between Germany
and the United States. Still more impor
tant arc the predictions made by Mr. Ma
son as to the treatment Germany has in
store for United States trade at competi
tive points hereafter, and his warnings to
Americans of the German purpose to de
mand far higher duties on imports, es
pÂ«*ciaJly against the products of the United
St3tes. Germany, he. says, proposes to re
vise Its tariff on the line of a general and
heavy increase of duties, especially upon
Imports from the United States.
Mr. Mason has much to say about the
steadily growing Irritation exhibited by
the German press against the United
States and the criticiems of the trade
papers of our customs officers, who are
charsod with practicing chicanery In their
efforts to prevent undervaluation of Ger
man exi>orts to the United States. Ger
man trade with China has increased 70 per
cent during the last four years, and Ger
man capital is being invested with an
audacity which should stand as an ex
ample to Americans seeking foreign trade.
In conclusion, and recurring to the sub
ject of relations between the United States
and Germany in the future, Mr. Mason
has this to say:
There 1*. therefore, every possibility that the
new tariff and such amended special treaties
us Germany may consent to enact will modify
the commercial relations of the empire with
other nations, particularly with the United
States. It IÂ» net to be denied or overlooked
that while the attitude of the Imperial Govern
ment toward our country has Deen uniformly
correct there is in certain business circles here
a fe^linir of enmity and resentment .which did
not exist prior to 1S9S. The heavy balance of
trade which the United States now hold*
against the fatheTland. the decline in textile
export* and the sharpened customs regulations
against undervaluations, f the concessions re
cently jrranteÂ«l to France and. above 'all, the
enormous growth of American manufactured
exports, the aggressive competition of -Amcrl
c&a metal and other products in South Ameri
can and eastern markets â all these welKh heav
ily on the hearts of the people here and will
be hard foupfct when the new tariff and treat
ies come to open debate in the Reichstag. What'
mort enlishtfned thinkers expoct. or at least
hope for. is that out of all theÂ«Â»e- mutations will
come a broad, liberal, comprehensively framed
treaty or series of treaties between the United
States and Gertsany In which all the vexed
and irritating questions i-niatlngf to naturalized
citizenship, countervailing duties and port
â¢charges on vessels shall be regulated and lib
eral Justice to imports of food products se
cured by rÂ«"cii>rocal concessions and embodied

WASHINGTON, May 20.â An au
dience remarkable for its size,
sympathy and enthusiasm
greeted the Boer envoys at the
reception given in their honor
to-night at the Grand Opera
houpe, under the auspices of the Congres
sional and citizens' committee. The house
was crowded to suffocation,, and .many
were turned awey." The interior was deco
rated with the national tri-color of
both the United States and the TransvaaJ.
There were probably thirty members of
the Senate and House present. Speaker
Henderson was in one of the boxes, and
others present were Senators Daniel. Tei

Latimer, Lentz, Sulzer. Landis, Linney,

Hay, Deannong, Clark of Missouri, Meiers
and Rea of New Tork.
One of the boxes, it was stated, was re
served for the President, a committee
having been to the White House with
tickets for the opera-house, but no repre
sentative of the President's official house
hold was on hand.
Chairman Sulzer of the reception com
mittee presided, and a number of ad
dresses, all of them patriotic in character
and earnestly supporting the cause of the
Boers, were made, the speekers including
Messrs. Fischer, Wolmarans and Wesseis,
the.Boer envoys. Senator Wellington, Hon.
Bourke Cockran and Mr. Sulzer. Chair
man Sulzer was the first speaker. He
said in part:

that we must be prepared to fight for it,
adding that the latter must be gratified
at the hearty response which had been
made throughout this country. Referring
to Canada and its proximity to the United
State*, he said he believed as an English
possession it was a menace to the main
tenance of the Monroe doctrine. As a pos
sible result of this war, he suggested that
instead of the extension- of monarchical
governments in South Africa the conse
quence might be the extension of repub

doors while discussing the resolution of

The three envoys were introduced in
turn by Mr. Sulzer, and each was given a
cordial reception. Their remarks were
listened to with close attention. The au
dience gave a standing greeting to Com
missioner Fis-cher, who told his hearers'
why the envoys had come to this country
and what they hoped to accomplish. His
remarks were very much In keeping with
what he already has said in published
interviews. Said he:
We come to you as a sreat liberty-loving
people, in whom thf sÂ«pnse of justice and fair

Mr. Wolmarans. who spoke in Dutch,
said that while the envoys did expect to

them in New York City and Washington.

ST. LOUIS, May 20.â Cars were running
to-day on five of the lines of the St.
Louis Transit Company without any In
terference on the part of the strikers.
No attempt was made to run the cars on
schedule time. Two riot calls were sent
in to the Police Department during the
afternoon, but the riots were very far
from being the real thing.
'The strikers made the assertion that
all day long they had men along the dif
ferent lines which were in operation,
discouraging every attempt at interfer
ence with the cars, on account of women
and children who would wish to ride
around the city on Sunday.
There was a report that all the em
"ployes of the Suburban Company who re
turned to work a week ago were to go
out again Monday morning, because the
company had not made good Its prom
ises regarding places for the old men. The
report was denied by the officials of the
road and by the men.
There was a slight disturbance late this
evening atrthe intersection of Tenth street
and Washington avenue. A switch had
been thrown and a car loaded with pas
sengers was thrown on a dead wire and
oft the track. When the train crew start
ed to set things to rights they were
greeted with showers of stones and com
pelled to abandon the work until a patrol
wag:on loaded with police officers ap
peared on the ground. The police quickly
forced the crowd to disperse, making sev

of the National Building Trades Council,
was doing his best to prevent a collision
with the police, when he was taken into
custody. He was taken to the police sta

ing admitted that his arrest was an error.
The arrested men were booked as Federal
prisoners, the charge against them being
disorderly conduct in violation, of the in

The Metal Trades Council Aas decided
to recommend to all affiliated unions
that they go out on a sympathetic strike
whenever asked to do so. About 5500 men

FATALLY SHOT
AS THE RESULT
OF A QUARREL
Charles Albertson Killed
by J. Wess Moore at
REDDING.' May. 20.-A fatal shooting
affray, occured at the noon hour yester
day at what is known as Cherry Flat,
-twelve miles south of Trinity Center, in
Trinity County. J. Wess Moore, an old
man owning a number of mining claims
In upper Trinity, and Charles Albertson, a
young miner, were the parties to the
fray. The two had quarreled on several
different occasions over the ownership of
a claim, and Moore alleges that Albertson
made repeated threats to take his life. In
fact, Moore visited the District Attorney
at Weaverville quite recently and con
sulted with him in reference to prosecut
ing for the threats, but it Is eaid he was
advised to drop the matter.
Yesterday noon Moore and Albertson
met close to the former's home, and the
quarrel was resumed. Moore had his rifle
with him, a 45-caliber gun, but did not
offer to make use of it until Albertson
drew a revolver. At this juncture the by
standers interfered and sougKt to take the
revolver from Albertson, whereupon the
latter struggled with them. Fearing he
might turn upon them they desisted and
stepped back, and then Moore raised his
rifle and fired. The ball entered the breast
of Albertson and emerged at his shoulder,
causing almost instant death. Moore went
at once to Trinity Center and surrendered
to the Deputy Sheriff. The body of the
victim remained exactly where it lay un
til the arrival, of the Coroner to-day.
Albertson was about 32 years of at?e
and was of large and muscular build.
His slayer is an old resident of Trinity, a
veteran of the Civil War and about 65
years of age. He is quite well known
over the country. His plea is self-defense.

GIVES THE LIE TO
CIVIL WAR HISTORY
General Manning Declares the Story
of Sheridan's Hide Is All
j "Poppycock."
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON, May 2O.-General Stephen H.
Manning, who was second in command
during Sheridan's ride, gave out" an amaz
ing interview here to-day, completely up
setting civil war histo/y. He said he could
no longer refrain from the temptation to
tell the truth and correct "the damnable"
injustice of. the faked historical accounts
of this famous episode. Sheridan's ride,
he says, was all "poppycock."
General Wright was in command of the
Sixth Corps and Manning was quarter
master general and second In command
General Manning says that he met Sheri
dan two years before his death and that
Sheridan then admitted that he had done
wrong in claiming the credit. General
Manning continues:
"Sheridan claimed that It was his arrival
that turned the tide of battle. Some poet
wrote a gushing song about the matter
and that settled it. Since then it has been
absolutely useless to tell the truth about
this historic Incident.
"Js'ow, what are the facts In this case?
I speak from personal knowledge, as the
second officer in command, when I say
that Sheridan's iide is pure poppycock.
He did ride from Winchester, but no fast
er than any other well mounted otlit-or
' could have done. He claimed to havt
found the whole army disorganized and
fleeing down the valley and that it was
his presence that turned the tide. It is
absolutely false. His coming changed
nothing. When he reached us he found a
lot of sutlers, camp-followers and bum
mers running toward Winchester. That is
always the case in all-armies when In bat
tle. Possibly there might have been 500
of this crowd that Sheridan met. but they
did not constitute the army by a long
shot. Sheridan waved his sword at them
In a theatrical manner, and some of them
stopped and many more didn't."

Â¦which are kept within bourds only by fear

"As a cosmopolitan, rather than an en

is composed of a strange conglomeration
of ppopV-5. many of whom have no sym

that some r.f th<> subjupattMa peoples that

higher in the standard of intellect, morala

ruling Romanoffs, as the Caucasian, for
instance, who 1b far superior in prowess

ADVERTISEMENTS.The day opened for the delegates at 7
o'clock in the morning, when they all met
at the Central Methodist Church. At 9:30
o'clock the delegates held prayer circles
and family worship wherever quartered
about the city, and at 11 o'clock they at
tended the local churches. At 2:15 to-day
j a street song service was held on the
plaza, conducted by Miss Nettle C. Smal
ley of Pacific Grove. At 3 o'clock there
were three simultaneous rallies, one at
the pavilion, conducted by Francis W.
Reid, for men only. Â«
The principal speakers were State Young
Men's â¢ Christian Association Secretary
William M. Parsons and Dr. W. H. G.
Temple of Seattle. There was another
rally for young people at the Central
Methodist Episcopal Church, and a third
was held at the First Presbyterian
Church for children and parents. This
evening there was a vesper service, led by
George P. Lowell of Oakland. This was
followed by a devotional service led by
the Rev. Arthur C. Dodd of National
City. The convention chorus was then
sung, after which the newly elected offi
cers were installed with due ceremony.
The members of the Stockton 1900 com
mittee and the . representatives of
Santa Ana, where the 1&01 convention will
be held, were then introduced to the au
dience amid loud applause. A vocal duet
by the .Roberts sisters of Oakland was
followed by an address by Rev. William
White of San Francisco, "Let Your Light
Shine." after which Â¦ the male quartet
from Alameda County sang. Dr. Temple
delivered an ' address on ' "Power â Its
Source and Use," following which the
jjonventlon chorus rendered an anthem.
The closing exercise was the consecra
tion service, led by Retiring State Presi
dent J. E. Coulthurst. The convention
closed with the singing of the hymn "God
Be With You Till We Meet Again," and
the Mizpah benediction.

tered 834 delegates and 459 visitors, mak
ing a total of 1351. The largest delegation
was from San Joaquin Countyâ 147 jun

mittee of the Democratic Union party has
decided to recommend that the members
of the party abstain from voting at the

tend that the election preparations are
being carried out in such an unfair way
as to make it Impossible for the opponents
of those in power to get a hearing. On
the other hand, It Is asserted that the
real motive underlying this action "Is the

BOOM FOR FAIRBANKS.
Indiana Senator Mentioned for the
Presidency in 1904.
INDIANAPOLIS,^ May 20.â Indiana Re
publican leaders and delegates to the Na
tional convention will go to Philadelphia
with the intention of starting a booom for
Senator Fairbanks for President in 1904.
They have talked the matter over among
themselves and have come to the conclu
sion that the time is ripe to begin. Since
Congressman I^andis, in a speech before
the State convention, announced that In
diana would propose the name of Senator
Fairbanks for President in 1904 it has been
regarded as almost a certainty that Sen
ator Fairbanks will be a candidate for the
nomination.
Republican leaders in the State say
there is a growing sentiment for him else
where, and that unless something unex
pected happens the prominent men of a
number of States will rally to his support
when the time comes for him to make an
announcement. It is generally believed
that the course of Senator Fairbanks has
been pleaplng to the President, Senator
Hanna and others, and the leaders ln this
State feel that it will not be difficult to
impress the crowds at Philadelphia that
Senator Fairbanks is the right man for
the party to name for President next
time. It is probable that Senator Fair
banks will be made chairman of the In
diana delegation at Philadelphia, There
will probably be a thousand Indlanana at
the convention.
MAY FOEM NEW PARTY.
Hawaiians Do Not Care to Become
Bepublicans or Democrats.
HONOLULU, May 12.â If their leaders
have any control over their political des
tinies the natives ot, the islands will not
for some time to coma express affiliation,
with either of the two great political
parties.
So much was decided by a number of
them at a meeting held recently. At this
meeting were men Inclined to be Republi
cans, and some favorable to he princi
ples of Democracy. A majority, it may
be said, were dubious of both, and favor
ed some sort of Hawaiian alliance, tak
ing in such whites as -were acceptable to
their ideas. The Portuguese were men
tioned.
The wish or desire or idea of the natives
Is to form an Independent party. This was
plain in the meeting. If they had a
strong leadership and money this would
unquestionably be done, it was re
marked that out of 14,000 votes that could
be mustered the natives would poll 9000.
Some of these would be lost to the Repub
lican and Democratic parties, but with
white and Portuguese allies they would
have a large majority.

SAN JOSE, May,20.â Politicians of both
forces took a rest to-day, and, aside
from a little quiet button-holing, little
campaign work was done. The lull be
fore the battle of ballots to-morrow was
tiring in its quietness after the excite
ment of the last few days. Both sides
are lined up for the struggle, which prom
ises to mean so much for San Jose. The
real question before the voters is whether
the administration of the city shall be
gang or anti-gang.
Indications are such that a victory of
the citizens' ticket seems certain, but, of
course, something unforeseen might hap
pen. The Itea sang admits the election
will be close. Mayor Martin claims his
re-election. He is pleading for one more
term, that some ideas that recently came
to him might be put into effect.
Edwards is standing on his past record
as a citizen and business man. His pro
gressiveness was shown in the Bank Com
mision and the general Interest he has
taken In city affairs. The Citizens' Com
mittee of One Hundred claims his election
and the rest of the ticket by a good ma
jority. The Citizens* platform is short
and to the point, and with Edwards to
administer city affairs along Its lines San
Jose's future Is bright. The party declares
itself for a better and greater city and
the purging of yolitics from .its affairs;
the abolishment of favoritism and nepot
ism that has so characterized Martin's
administration, and the impartial en
forcement of the provisions of the new
charter. The committee pledges this
ticket to such an administration: Mayor,
H. J. Edwards; Clerk, William J.
Dougherty; Treasurer. William Fischer;
Councilmenâ Second Ward. Byron Mil
lard; Third Ward, Tobe'Lord.
The Citizens' committee this afternoon
appointed a full list of precinct watchers
and workers, and took other means to
prevent any of the disreputable methods
that have hitherto characterized politics
in this city. For the first time In the his
tory of reform movements in this city
has practical politicians been directing
affairs. - r Â«
The Rea and Mackenzie push will make
a desperate effort to carry the city. Their
defeat to-morrow, coming on top of the
Good Government League victory at. the
last county election, means their utter an
nihilation. They have promised positions
on the boards and commissions, and even
traded the rest of their ticket to try and
save Martin. The orders have been to do
anything to elect the Mayor, as they will
have a majority in the boards "and com
missions for over a~ year, even if defeat
ed. Many former devotees of Rea and
Mackenzie have deserted them, and the
twin bosses realize they are up against a
hard thing.
It is believed Edwards will g-et a big
quiet vote from business people who fear
gang rule. His forces are united and
confident, and the general expression Is
that he will be lected.

SUICIDE OF AH" OLD MAN
William Le Montagne Ends His Lifa
in San Jose.
Sp#dal Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE. May 20.â William le Mon
tagne, an old resident of this county, com
mitted suicide at noon to-day at the
Branch Pacific Hotel on South Market
street by cutting his throat. He had been
drinking for several days, and despond
ency is said to have been the cause. Mon
tagne slashed his throat and stabbed
himself in the stomach. Ho then opened
a window leading: out on to a porch on
the first story and tumbled over the rail-
Ing to the sidewalk, a distance of about
twenty feet. He was removed to the Re
ceiving Hospital, where he died about an
hour later.
Montagne was formerly a prosperous
farmer in the Almaden district, but ad
versities overtook him. A family of
grown children survives him. He was a
native of New York, aged about 53 veara.

CHRISTIAN SCIENTISTS
MAY BE PROSECUTED
Masons of Topeka Incensed at the
Death of Mrs. John H.
Torrence.
TOPEKA, Kans.. May 20.â The Masonic
order of Topeka, particularly the Knights
Templar, are planning to prosecute local
Christian Scientists, who, they say,
were responsible for the death of Mrs.
John M. Torrence. Mr. Torrence was.
up to the time of his death, eight months
ago, chief clerk in the Santa Fe car ser
vice here. He was a leading Mason. His
wife died yesterday from typhoid fever.
She was a Christian Scientist, and. with
the local healers, resisted the demands of
her friends that a physician be sum
moned.
Mrs. Whltlock of Chicago, mother of
Mrs. Torrence, was, it is asserted, re
fused permission to see her daughter, but
finally entered the sIck room. Mrs. E. E.
Whltaker, the Scientist In charge, said in
testifying at the Coroner's inquest, that
Mrs. Torrence was killed by the shock of
the surprise at seeing her mother, and
not by the lack of medicine. The Cor
oner's jury rendered the following ver
dict:

Old Califomians will be Interested in
the two S. M. Brookes' fruit pictures now
on. exhibition here. Mr. Brookes was a
long-ago favorite of the California public,
and his fruit, fish and other edible ar
rangements in . art were deservedly fa
mous as dining-room decorations. The
two specimens in question are peach ana
apple panels, and are happy examples of
the late artist's manner.
William Keith. Grace Hudson and Theo
dore Worea are also, to the fore. The
Keith landscape, a cloudy day in the hills
with a brilliant break in the sky. Is a
small gem. Miss Hudson's Indians are
interesting, as usual, the '.'Head of a
Squaw" more particularly. The examples
of Mr. Wores - work are perhaps not of
his best, the wistaria garden color scheme
being somewhat forced and unnatural.
Maurice B. Prendergast has an Inter
esting exhibition at a local gallery- This
clever Bostonian, whose close artistic
friendship with our prince of painters.
Whistler, is quoted as hl3 raison d'etre,
perhaps hardly -needs this stunning
recommendation, though that the exam
ples of his work here ! exhibited are of
his best is, 1 think, doubtful. All water
colors are these and mostly Venetian, a
curious compound in style of Ford Madox
Brown, Walter Crane and the very orig
inal entity, Mr. Prendergast himself.
Strong In color, certain in drawing,
though almost insolent, yet charming, in
their vagueness at times, an unconven
tional handling of conventional subject,
a free treatement of crowds, which does
not prevent one, however, from feeling
the scene too "busy" unreposeful; some
times these drawing should command re
spectful attention from the artistic pub
lic. The "Bridge of Paglia," "Veneta
Marina," "Venetian Canal Scene" and
the "San Marca" will probably prove the
more interesting.

It has. since been reproduced by Graves,
who has taken much interest in our tal

exhibition of Miss Withrow's work has
recently been made. Miss Withrow'a
"Crystal Gazer" has attracted much fa
vorable attention, as also her portraits

The people of California have a right to expect that
in the indictments for perjury in this case the bar w'ill
co-operate with the courts in making an investigation
that will be searching and thorough. If the accused
parties be innocent, they have a right to have that
! Under such circumstances it is the imperative dutv
j of all who have been intrusted by the people with the
I administration of justice to see to it the crime of pcr-
J jury be checked by vigorous prosecutions in every
case where it is suspected, and by the severest penal
ties in every instance where guilt is proved. That
duty is imposed not only upon Judges and juries but
I ilpon the bar itself, for the bar will not be held guilt
less if perjury escape punishment. Again and again
in cases whose magnitude or whose sensational fea
j tures attract public attention suspicion has been
j aioused that the lawyers in the case have either
suborned perjury or accepted it in the interests of
their clients. It is not necessary to cite specific in
| stances of that kind, nor to give names of suspected
; parties. It is sufficient to say such suspicions have
! been excited so frequently in contested will cases and
i other suits involving large sums of money that the
bar cannot afford to treat them"with contempt.
That there has been a tendency toward perjury in
our courts of late years is beyond dispute. The evil
has been felt in every State, from the Atlantic to the
Pacific Coast. It has been noted in high cases of
national importance, heard in evidence given before
committees of the United States Senate sitting with
the authority of courts and having the right to ad
minister oaths; and from those august tribunals
down to the Justice Courts, where the common peo
ple seek an honest settlement of. their controversies,
the same blighting villainy is manifest. It has be
come "a crime of the time," and constitutes one of
the most portentous menaces to the weltare of the re-
While thus careful not to wrong the rights of either
of those whose reputation and liberty is now at stake
upon the serious charges against them, The Call will
not pretend to be indifferent to the gravity of the
issue involved in the prosecution of perjury. Upon
the honesty of courts and their ability to secure to
every man his rights our whole social structure rests.
All civilization' is based upon justice, upon the con
fidence of men that, subject to the human liability
to error, essential fair dealing will be secured through
the courts to every member of society whenever his
property, his rights, his liberty or his life is wronged
or menaced. Therefore when justice is poisoned st
its fountain by perjury, a wrong is clone not only to
the litigants in the particular case in which the per
jury was committed but to the whole community.
THE PERJURY PROSECUTIONS.
UPON the question of the guilt or innocence of
the parties indicted by the Grand Jury for per
jury in the Fair case The Call will not under
take to pronounce judgment. The accused persons
are now in the hands of the courts and are entitled
to a fair and impartial trial, not only in the court it
self but before the larger bar of public opinion. The
Call therefore will give full reports of all the pro
ceedings in the several cases without prejudice or fa
vor and leave the decision to wait until all the "evi
dence on both sides has been heard.
As a picnic season this could hardly be beaten.
Even Bryan, were he in the -woods of California just
now, could find nothing to howl about and would be
compelled to talk optimism by the force of circum
stances and the influence of the climate.
. The Alameda Justice who sent a man to jail for
six months for stealing a kiss and then let a girl
who had stolen a diamond go with a sentence of fifty
days has so high an appreciation of kisses that the
girls should have rewarded him on the spot.
In this situation certain New York politicians have
seen a chance to boom a new candidate for the place â
none other than George B. McClellan, a son of the'
General whom the Democrats nominated for the
Presidency against Lincoln in 1864. Young McClel
lan is now a member of Congress and is said to have
expressed a willingness to take the place. He re
fused to state his views on the money question four
years ago. but he voted against the currency bill this
year, and that is supposed to make him eligible for
a position On the free silver ticket. Perhaps he will
be as good a mate as Bryan can have. He has no
more chance of carrying his State than Williams has
of carrying Massachusetts, but then he is not so much
of a talker as Williams, and that will be some ad
vantage to a ticket whose chief nominee is likely to
'overdo the talking business of the campaign without
any help from his running mate.
Most of the Democratic leaders desire ah Eastern
man on the ticket, but no name has yet been re
ceived with much favor. Pattison of Pennsylvania is
regarded as lukewarm in the cause of free silver,
Williams of Massachusetts is without influence, and
Van Wyck of New York and Dewey are too eminent
lo accept a subordinate place to Bryan.
As soon as the action at Sioux Falls had been taken
the Omaha Bee stated that Bryan's managers in the
convention had gone there with a paper in Bryan's
own handwriting suggesting three methods of dealing
with the Vice Presidency. One proposed that the
choice of the candidate for that office be left with a
committee to confer with similar committees to be
appointed- by the Democratic and the Silver Repub
lican conventions; the second that the Sioux Falls
convention select several names for the office, leaving
it to the Democrats and the Silver Republicans to
choose from among them; the third that some man
should be nominated who would withdraw if the
Democrats did not indorse him. i It is claimed that
Towne's nomination was an adoption of the third of
the three plans, and that he will retire whenever his
retirement is called for.
WHEN the Populists at Sioux Falls nominated
Towne for Vice President on the Bryan ticket
it was promptly announced, seemingly on au
thority, that the nomination would not stand, that the
Democrats would not indorse it, and that Towne
would retire to make way for the nominee of the
convention which is to meet at Kansas City, thus
saving Bryan from the perplexity of having two tails
to his kite as he had in 1896. It is probable the an
nouncement was correct, for certain it is the Demo
cratic leaders are busily casting about tor a man to
take the second place on their ticket, just as if. Air.
Towne ha'd no claims upon the position' whatever.
BRYAN'S RUNNING MATE.
The bank clearings of the country last week were
h.6 per cent less than in the same week last year.
Xew York fell off 18.8 per cent and Boston 12.3 per
cent. The commercial failures were 155, against 16S
last year. So much for statistics. They show that
while the volume of business is smaller this year the
failures are fewer. So be it â it shows that the coun
try is commercially healthy.
It is better as it is than as it was. It is better to do a
pood, steady business, as we are doing now, making
our moderate profit, than to be rushed by a boom,
which, though it is doubling those profits, perhaps, :s
bearing us on too furiously for our own good. Thanks
to the large increase in the circulation, there is plenty
<<i money in the country. In fact, we have more than
we want, and are again loaning it in large blocks to
Europe. The other day we loaned France $15,000,000
for her exposition. She needed it, Europe did not
hare it to spare, and it was a mere bagatelle to New
York. So she came over here and got it. A few
years more and New York will be the financial cen
ter of the world.
The shrinkage in values is steadily assuming a
wider range. At first it was confined to iron and steel
and hides: it now comprehends corn, pork, beef and
mutton, dairy products, wool, cotton, petroleum, lea-.l,
tin, lumber, nails, wire, paper and dozens of other
commodities. In place of the wild speculation in se
curities of a year ago, we now contemplate a liquidation
so pronounced that twenty preferred industrial stocks
sold la=t week at prices averaging $83 per share,
against $99 in the same week last year, and twenty
common stocks at an average of $38 50, against $77
last year. The working force, which at that time last
year was rapidly increasing, is now decreasing.
Paper, which was seriously scarce in 1899, is now
more plentiful, and tome of the works are actually
stopping to relieve the excessive production. Many
wool, leather and steel works are doing the same
thing. This stoppage of works and consequent dis
missal of a certain percentage of wage-earners is the
only unsatisfactory feature of the situation. Eusiness
in some lines has been almost suspended by the ob
stinacy of manufacturers and agents in holding on
to the high prices of 1899.
The boy tosses his bail into the air and uncon
sciously enunciates a great commercial truism ;vhen
lie cries, "What goes up must come down." This is
the situation in the United States to-day. The Call
foresaw it immediately after the new year, and pointed
out at the time that the limit of the public pocket had
been reached. Few saw it then; everybody sees it
now. It is easy to see through a millstone if some
body will point out the hole.
The proceeding is orderly. There is no excite
ment, no disturbance of credits, no stringency in
money, no cause for alarm. But all over the United
States conservatism is again the dominant force in
trade, for the boom of 1899 is over. That it came to
a pause without crash of any description is a matter
for general felicitation.
THE CURRENT LIQUIDATION.
THE country is now in the midst of the liquida
tion iollowing the great commercial boom of
1899. Slowly, and without shock, conditions
are adjusting themselves to normal pianes. Those
prices which soared too high are coming down, and
those branches which produced too many goods last
year are ceasing to produce. The readjustment is pro
ceeding with the irresistible but noiseless force of a
glacier. Nothing can stop it. It is the great law of
supply and demand reasserting itself after having
been feverishly diverted from its natural course. In
some lines the great manufacturing combines are lead
ing the decline; others are fighting it, but vainly, for
there is a limit to the public purse, and that limit was

Great Britain and Japan are the only
naval powers which appear to build ships
in accordance with some programme care
fully considered and then carried out. In
1S05 Japan adopted a naval programme
for a certain number of vessels of all
classes to be built and completed by April,
1906, involving an outlay of $106,000,000. Of
this number fifty-four vessels were to be
completed by 1901, and recent reports in
dicate that the ships will be ready. In
November last Japan had under construc
tion in French, English, German and
American shipyards no less than four bat
tleships, nine armored cruisers, two sec
ond-class cruisers, twelve torpedo-boat
destroyers, twenty-three seagoing tor
pedo-boats and fifty-six smaller torpedo
boats. At the home yards three large
vessels and ten torpedo-boats have been
taken in hand. All the contractors have
built within the time limits, barring a
few cases. During the present year de
livery was to .be made of three battleships
and four armored cruisers, as follows:
Battleshipsâ Asaki, 15,447 tons, April 30;
Hatsure and Urlkasa, of 15,200 tons, in Oc
tober: and> May. The four armored cruis
ers of displacements, ranging from 9900 to
9456, are named Yakumo, Azurna, Izumo
and Iwate, and are to be delivered April
1, June IB! July 15 and November 11, in the
order/ stated.'- The Asakl was completed
ahead of contract .
The startling information a couple of
weeks ago of the wonderful penetrating
power of the American 6-inch navy rifle
is subject to some modification. Accord
ing to the tables of the Bureau of Ord
nance a G-inch shell fired at a velocity of
3000 feet per second should penetrate a
Krupp plate 9.34 Inches in thickness, but
at a recent trial - it is alleged that with a
velocity of 25S0 feet the shell passed
through a 14-inch Krupp plate. Unless the
plate was defective such a feat was
clearly impossible. In England the 6-inch
Vicker gun was tried three years ago
with charges 25 per cent higher than the
ordinary service allowance, and attained
a shell velocity of 2940 feet, but the exces
sive wear to the gun with such a charge
makes this velocity undesirable, except on
rare occasions. As for the soft steel cap,
which enables the shell to work its way
through hard-faced armor, other naval
powers have had the same contrivance for
three years past, and thus "honors are
easy" in gun-making. . . - Viv
Another vast plant for the manufactur
ing of armor and guns is likely to be es
tablished in the near future in England.
The promoters of the enterprise have sent
delegations of experts to the United
States and Germany to study the methods
pursued, and are expected to" report by
the end of June. The vastness of this
undertaking may be realized from the fact
that it is intended to erect hydraulic
presses more powerful than any yet built,
that lathes are to be put up with a ca
pacity for boring a sixty-seven-ton gun
liner simultaneously from both ends. The
armor output facility is to equal that of
the other three establishments in Great
Britain, and the plant as a whole will
surpass that of any other in the world.
Prinz Helnrlch Karl, an armored cruiser
of S88O tons, was recently launched at the
dockyard at Kiel. The vessel is 393 feet
8& Inches in length, 64 feet 2% inches beam
and 23 feet draught, being 1S00 tons
smaller but of the general type of the
Furet Bismarck, and with less thickness
or armor. The armor belt and casements
are only 3.94 Inches, the belt tapering to
3.15 Inches at the ends. The armament
consists of two 9.45-inch guns mounted in
two turrets, six 6-lnch in casements and
four C-inch in turrets. She is designed to
have a speed of 20>Â£ knots, and her en
gines are to develop 15,000 horsepower.
The old ironclad Achilles is, after all,
not to be broken up, so the British ad
miralty has concluded to expend about
$35,000 toward converting her into a float
ing torpedo depot. The Achilles was re
boilered in 1S90, at an expense of $175,000,
but has remained in idleness at the Ports
mouth dockyard for twelve years past.
Her original cost in 1862 was $2,317,860. and
it cost up to 1S88 not less than $1,072,875 to
maintain a comparative efficiency.
One serious obstacle to the use of sub
marine boats for war purposes is this:
that, at a depth of twenty feet below the
surface, the light becomes so dim as to
enable a person within the boat to distin
guish objects only twenty-five feet ahead.
The use of any illuminant would only
tend to locate the position of the boat.
The Naiade, an iron hull and wood

Incased in a mental haughtiness before which plain wisdom is
dumb. But a time will come when the keenness of some girl s
stilletto of wit will prick the empty bubble of his flamboyant
egoism, and he will, for the first time, learn that he is but an
untrained man under thlrty-flve.
You cannot argue with the untrained man under thirty-nve.
In fact, I never argue with anybody, either man or woman, be
cause women are not reasonable beings and men are too rea
sonable.
Conversation with the untrained man under thirty- five 13
equally Impossible, because he never converses; he only talks.
And your chief accomplishment of being a good listener is en
tirely thrown away on him, because a mere talker never cares
whether you listen or not, as long as you do not interrupt him.
He only wants the floor and the sound of his own voice.
It is the trained man over thirty-Qve who can converse ana
v/ho wishes you to respond.
The untrained man desires to be amused. The trained man
v.-ishes to amuse. A man under thirty-five is in this world to
be made happy. The man over thirty-five tries to make you
happy.
There is no use of uttering a protest. You simply must wait
and let life take it out of him. The man under thirty-five is
being trained in a thousand ways every day that he lives. You
can do, little to help him, if you are the first girl to take a hand
at him. You can but prepare him to be a little more amenable
to the next girl. His mind is not on you. It is centered on
himself. He cares nothing for your likes and dislikes, your
cares -or hopes or fears. He only wishes you to be pretty and
well dressed. Have a mind if you will. He will not know it.
Have a heart and a soul. They do not concern him. He likes
to have you tailor-made. You are a Girl to him. That's all.
The eyes of the untrained man under thlrty-flve are never
taken off himself. They are always turned in. He is studying
himself first and foremost, and the world at large is interest-
Ing to him only inasmuch as It bears relation to himself as the
pivotal point. Join in his pursuit if you will; show the wildest
enthusiasm in his golf record or how many lumps of sugar he
takes in his coffee, and he will evince neither surprise nor grati
tude. You are only showing your good taste.
The conceit of one of these men is the most colossal speci

I revel in it, just as I do in a view of the ocean or the heavens
at night â anything so vast that 1 cannot see to the end of it- It
suggests eternity or space.
When successâ business or social or athletic or literary or
artisticâ comes to the untrained man under thirty-five, it comes
pitifully near being his ruin. The adulation of the world is
more intoxicating and more deadly than to drink absinthe out

PERSONAL MENTION.
And yet, I suppose, untrained men under thlrty-flve hav*
their use In the world, aside from the part they play In the dis
cipline of discriminating young women. Girls even marry these
men. Lovely girls, too. Clever girsâ girls who know a hundred
times more than their husbands and are ten times finer grained
I wonder if they love them, if they are satisfied with them. If
ennui of the soul Is not a bitter thing to bear. I am always
wondering why girls marry them.
But women wish to please men. aside from their power of
winning them. Whereas If men can get the girls without any
change on their part, they consider themselves a howling Â«uc
cess. But they might be a little bit surprised if they coulii read
the minds of these very wives whom they have won. whosa
life-work often may be only to improve them so that they will
make some other woman the kind of a husband they should
have made at first, and then to lie down and die.
So let men beware how they criticize us unfavorably, no
matter what their aeres, for the truth of the matter is that,
be we frivolous or serious, vain or sensible, clever or stupid,
rich or poor, we are what the American man has made us.

? Â°P s them to remember that I am not discussing Rirl

fection aa a man can become.
... * ar fl be Â»t from me to say that the untrained man under
thirty-five at his worst, is of no use in this world. He Is excel
lent for a two-step. I have used a number of them very suc
cessfully in this way.
It is the clever Rirl who suffers most of all from the un
trained manâ not the brilliant, meteoric girlâ but just the or
dinarily clever girl, as other girls know her. Being a real
woman, she likes to be liked. She wishes to please men. We all
do. But what kind of men are we to please? Untrained men
under thirty-iive? Owins to the horrible prevalence of thesa
men. some girls become neither fish flesh nor fowl, nor kooÂ«1
red herring. They see their silly, pink-cheeked sisters followed
and admired. They know either how shallow these Rlrls are
or how cleverly hypocritical. Clever pfirls are also human. They
love to go about and wear pretty clothes, and dance, and be
admired quite as much as anybody.

are facts. Men make no secret of the kind of women they want
us to be. e Ket preached at from pulpits and lectured at

The record runs thus: The yellow journals said
the wedding cost $1,500,000 â it didn't cost more than
$10,000. It was said Mr. Benedict gave the bride a
check for $1,000,000â no check whatever was given.
The bride's trousseau was reported to '. have cost
$250,000 â it did not cost as much as $2500. The floral
decorations at the church were estimated to have cost
$100.000 â they were furnished from Mr. Benedict's
garden and cost no more than the wages of twelve
men who were employed for half a day in. putting
them up. It was said Mr. Benedict followed the English
custom and distributed $1060 in gifts to servants â he
did not. It was published that at the house the full
Damrosch orchestra played â Mr. Damrosch, who was
a guest, was the only member of the orchestra pres
ent. The music was said to have cost $25,000 â it cost
$250. The rloraldecorations at the house were valued
at $25,000â they consisted of flowers from the garden
arranged by the household. The collation was re
ported to have cost $50,000 â it cost less than $1800.
Mr. Benedict was reported to have placed the steam
yacht Oneida at the disposal of the bride and groom
for a cruise in the Mediterranean at a cost of $300,000
â the yacht carried the happy 'pair no farther than
from Greenwich to New York City.
The news thus dished up by the yellow fakers had a
stimulating effect in circles where such papers are
read, and as a consequence we are told the Benedicts
received a multitude of letters from persons eager to
share in the prodigal bounty of a man willing to pay
cut so many thousands of dollars for flowers and show
at a wedding. These letters are of all kinds and from
all^ sorts of silly folks. We are told that one old lady
asks for money to enable her to take a journey to
meet her four sisters whom she "has not seen in sixty
years." Another woman demands $4000 to pay off a
mortgage on her house, and insists that if the $4000
cannot be sent at once $5 be sent .anyway.
Such is yellow journalism in the effete East, and
in the Golden West it is not widely different.
WHEN the Hastings-Benedict wedding took
place at Greenwich, Conn., a short time ago,
the yellow journals wrote it up with such a
sensational glow of saffrdli exaggeration that the New
York Sun thought it worth while to get the facts and
by publishing them show, the contrast between legiti
mate news and the stuff which the fakers furnish to
their gullible readers. The results of the labors of
the Sun are sufficiently striking- to be read with in
terest-even on this side of the continent, for we have
a yellow journal in our own city, and it is worth while
to know how such papers make a. reputation.
ONE OF THE YELLOW F^K^S.
A MAN UNDER THIRTY-FIVE
AN UNTRAINED CUB
One of the notable features of the Alameda move
ment is the promptness with which it was started the
moment a need for it was evident. This is another
illustration of the superior capacity of the men who
control and carry on the orchard industry in Califor
nia. No class of business men trained by daily habit
in dealing with the markets of the world to form as
sociations and to act quickly could have moved with
greater vigor or with more sagacity than the Alameda
fruit-growers have done in this instance. It is safe to
say an industry in the hands of such men is not going
to suffer in the competitions of the world. Men of
that type will be always able to look out for them
selves and profit by every change in the situation.
In the end it will probably be found advisable for
the canners and the growers of California to combine
and work together, on a plan similar to that now pro
posed for co-operation between the growers and the
packers of dried fruit. Such a combination would
leave the business sufficiently diversified to enable
each branch of it to be carried on independently as
an industry while combined as a trade; that is, the
growing of the fruit would be in the hands of expert
orchardists and the canning and selling would be in
the hands of experts in those lines, while the profits
of the sale of the canned fruit would be equitably di
vided.
The very forces which have made it advisable for
the canners to combine make it also advisable for the
growers to combine. The economic tendencies of the
time enforce co-operation, and it seems certain that
those who have not the ability to combine, organize
and co-operate must suffer disaster until through a
painful experience they learn how to adapt themselves
to the conditions of their time and country. â¢
Conceding the best intentions to the canners, how
ever, it remains true that orchardists will be wise in
organizing for co-operative effort whenever it may be
needed. It is well to have confidence in others.' but it
is also well to have not too much. Among the di
vinities of the Greeks there was one whom they repre
sented in poetry, in painting and in sculpture, as wear
ing always helmet and breastplate and bearing shield
and spear â full armed at all times and all places â and
that divinity was known to them as the goddess of
wisdom.
So far as we know there has been no movement on
the part of the canners' combine to injure the or
chardists, and if the leaders of the combine be. wise
there never will be such an intent on their part, for
unless fruit-growing be profitable the industry will
diminish and the canners will find themselves in the
position of the man who killed the goose that laid the
golden egg. The large output of fruit will decrease
and the canners will then be unable to obtain a suffi
cient amount of it to compete with the rival canners
BY way of meeting the menace to their industry
caused by the combination of the canners, the
fruit-growers of Alameda County have taken
steps toward organizing for the purpose of handling
and canning and marketing their fruit themselves.
Whether it be or ever was the purpose of the canners
to wrong the fruit-growers does not in any way affect
the wisdom of the action thus taken, and it would be
well for orchardists in other counties to follow the
example.

The history of the Whig party, pre-'

the Texas question. Some further de
tails are now needed.
Even before the adoption of the Mis
souri compromise covetous eyes looked
across the Sablne to the grassy and fer
tile plains of Texas. Interpreting the
treaty with France to Include that prov
ince, citizens from the Southern States
soon bepan to make settlements therein,
and in 1812 a body of such "invaders,"
with the assistance of discontented resi
dents, attempted forcibly to take over
the province and set up a new govern
ment. Though the effort was put down,
the determination to secure possesion con
tinued to gain strength in the Southern
States. More extensive occupations of
Texas lands were made and more formld-
The Texas Struggle.
The real mischiefs which the Missouri com
promise engendered were these: The strife for
political power between slavery and freedom
which it sanctioned and perpetuated upon the
broad national domain; the insatiate appetite
for foreign acquisitions south of that line,
whether by war or purchase, which it whetted;
and, finally, by suffering an Immense State like
Missouri, whose population near the confluence
of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers was sura
to increase rapidly, to be set above the geo
graphlcal latitude; the license it gave to the
wolves of slavery to ravage among the scat
tered free-soil settlers over Its borders. Never
theless, this sectional compact waa faithfully
sustained for more than thirty years; it waa
broken at length not by those who had bound
themselves to keep It. but by degenerate sons
of slavery, by disciples of the malignant John
Randolph school, who constantly stirred the
South to believe that slavery should accept no
territorial restraints at all. (Schouler. vol m,
p. 172.)
The great Northwest Territory, prolific of
many powerful States, was dedicated to
freedom. If the South was to hold her
own she must be vigilant as to what lay
west of the father of waters. Arkansas
came In with slavery in 1S36, balanced by
free Michigan lnlS37. By the terms of
the Missouri compromise no further space
remained for slavery expansion save a
part of Indian Territory, while the pos
sibilities of freedom were bounded only
by the Pacific Ocean.
A recent historian puts the situation
after the adoption of the Missouri com
promise in these graphic words:
"For any human movement or develop
ment," said Mr. London, "there must be
a maximum limit, beyond which it can
not proceed. The hope of humanity lies
In that It may change its direc
tion. There are, however, in their econ
omic evolution, families of men which
failed at the crucial moment to effect a
change of direction, and were forced to
fall back. Vanquished at the moment of
their maximum, they have dropped out
of the whirl of the world, and have suc
cumbed to stronger competitors.
"Divers queries arise, as 'What Is the
maximum of commercial development the
world can sustain?' 'How far can it be ex
ploited?' 'How much capital Is neces
sary?' For 100 years England has been
producing surplus valuesâ that Is, excess
of production over consumption, or as
much to the purpose, she has been add
ing to her capital. But-hand to hand with
her foreign investments have grown her
adverse balances of trade. What causes
anxiety is that her export trade Is fall
ing oil without a corresponding diminu
tion of her imports, and that her securi
ties and foreign holdings cannot stand the
strain The control of the world's com
merce and banking is slipping through her
"'^The' United States has not failed to
pass from the side of the debtor to that of
the creditor nations. She has become wise
in the way of producing surplus values.
She has been successful In her efforts to
secure economic emancipation. But that
there must be a limit to the accumulation
of capital Is apparent at a glance. When
a great nation has equipped itself to pro
duce more than it can consume under the
present division of the net product it
seeks other markets for its surplus prod
ucts. With the. competition of several
other nations the question of the disposal
of this surplus grows serious, and finally
reaches the critical stage. Once capital
production _ has attained its maximum
growth, the strength of capital on the
one hand and the education and wisdom
of the workers on the other will deter
mine whlÂ«h path society Is to traverse,
and the change of direction must be
toward either economic oligarchies or
economic socialism. "_
An interesting lecture was delivered last
night in the Turk-street Temple by
"Jack" London under the auspices of the
Socialist Labor party. The subject of the
lecture was "The Maximum Dealing With
Surplus Values," which was handled in
a masterly manner by the lecturer, who
showed a thorough knowledge of the
economic question Involved In Its consid
eration. Mr. London, who Is a writer of
some clever short stories. Is connected
with the Socialist movement in Oakland,
and has written a number of books on the

not only on the talent of the pupils, but
also on the ability of their preceptors.
Several hundred designs are hung on the
walls, and a large number of art lovers
availed themselves of the privilege to in

equilibrium between the slave-holding and
the free sections of the Union seemed
about to be broken. The free States were
gaining rapidly over the South in popu
lation, and since representation In the
lower house of Congress was regulated by
population, it was evident that they were
likely to control that House. In the Sen
ate the division of power was nearly
equal, since each State, of whatever size
or population, was represented by two
members. But a new slave State, with
two more Senators representing the slave
power would disturb the balance. The
difficulty was finally met. as we have seen,
by the coining in of Maine along with
Missouri, together with the adoption of
the famous Missouri compromise, which

of that line. The measure was conceived
In the interest of the South, and accepted
as binding upon the nation by both South
ern and Northern Congressmen. By the
accepted Interpretation of the constitu
tion Congress had no power to interfere
with slavery In a State; by the Missouri
compromise It was established that Con
gress had power to prohibit slavery in a
Territory.
From this era dates as a permanent
underlying political force a mutual sensi
tiveness and jealousy between North and
South respecting superiority in Federal
councils. Under the compromise this
spirit seemed to be quiescent for a time,
but it was only the surface that was
calm. Mason and Dlxon's lineâ the boun
dary separting Pennsylvania from the
States to the Southâ had long been ac
cepted as the dividing line between free
and slave territory east of the Mississippi.
While the Judges were deliberating
Father O'Ryan addressed the audience.
He spoke of the Memorial day services
which would be conducted by the regi
ment in St. Mary's Cathedral, and said it
was the duty of every member of the
organization to turn out on that occasion
and help decorate the graves of the com
rades who had departed this life. He also
touched on the competitive drill and con
cert to be held in Mechanics' Pavilion on
June 8 by the regiment, and told of the
preparations for the big event. His men
tion of the cadets' coming encampment
at Santa Cruz was warmly applauded.
The judges then awarded the laurels of
victory to the representative of St. Fran
cis parish. The singing of the "Te Deum"
by the entire audience concluded the ex
ercises.
was then heard, after which Private
Healey took the floor. The latter had a
good â¢delivery, and showed by his state
ments that he had made a careful and
conscientious study of his subject. His
essay was regarded by many as equal to
Behan's, but the victor had a stronger
voice and' enunciated more clearly. The
audience then sang "America," and at
the conclusion of the national hymn Pri
vate Will Carey was given a hearing.
Carey was nervous, and this went against
him when the judges summed up the
merits of the four essays.
pany A and Sergeant Colllgan of Company
G. He also named Miss Nellie Sullivan,
Miss Julia Coffey, .J. W. Flynn and E. J.
Murphy as judges of the merits of each
essay and its delivery. The latter took
seats in the audience, and when the prop
er time came rendered their verdict in
favor of young Behan.
At the conclusion of the chairman's re
marks the contestants drew for places.
Behan was first to address the assem
blage. In clear, concise sentences ho dis
cussed the deadly cigarette. Before he
concluded he had pointed out the evils
accruing from the distasteful habit. He
argued that it was detrimental to the
nation, because the young men who will
some day help to govern had their senses
dulled, health impaired and their vitality
sapped by using the "coffin nails." He
had a number of authorities to back
his opinion that the cigarette Is deadly.
He eald the military ana naval academies
of the United States opposed smoking, as
it was Injurious to the health and activity
of the cadets. Younp: Behan's effort won
deserved applause. Miss Rose Broderick
followed with a soprano solo. The young
lady sang sweetly, and for an encore sang
"Clorindy" with all the gusto of a "cole
black lady."
Sergeant Colligan was the next to take
up the cudgel against the vice, and did
himself full Justice. A song by Will Judge

The Missouri Compromise.
The United States had long coveted the
Floridas, and after having, on one pre
text or another, taken possession of West
Florida, acquired East Florida by pur
chase from Spain In 1S19. By the treaty
which settled this transaction the boun
daries of the Louisiana purchase were
fixed anew, and this time excluded Texas.
The country seems to have cared little
then for what was afterward recovered
at such bloody cost. Some dissatisfaction
with this "alienation" of what had been
considered United States property was ex
pressed by a Congressional resolution
drawn by Henry Clay, but the general
satisfaction in the acquisition of Florida
prevented any effective agitation of the
matter.
In seeking for the causes of the Mexican
war one Is led back step by step to the
first purchase of territory by the United
States. The Loulsana purchase of 1S03
was understood to include what afterward
became the State of Texas, though defin
ite boundaries could not be given, and the
whole matter always remained unsettled
and confused. This immense tract of
land, lying almost wholly west of the Mis
sissippi, had but recently come to France
from Spain. Like all Spanish colonies, it
practiced slavery. An act of Congress in
1804 permitted immigrants Into the terri
tory to take their slaves with them, and
when, in 1812, the first of the States to be
carved out of the vast domain came in as
Louisiana, It came, as a matter of course,
with slavery well established. ' .

Copyright, 1900, b y Seymour Eaton,
CHICAGO, May 20.â The Record to
morrow will say: It is reported on what
seems to be adequate authority that ne
gotiations are now In progress looking
toward a consolidation of the Pressed
Steel ' Car Company and the American
Car and Foundry Company.
The Car and Foundry Company has
SCO.OOO.COO each of 7 per cent non-cumula
tive preferred and common stock. W.
K. Bixby and William McMillan of New
York are the principal officers of the
company. â¢ '- - .
The Pressed Steel Car Company has a
total capitalization of $25,000,000. Its most
important works are located at Pittsburg
and Joliet, 111.
The two concerns are not competitive
the ordinary sense, making the sarao
articles but of wholly different typÂ«s â
the former wooden cars and "composite"
bolsters, etc, and the latter making all
steel cars, bolsters and truck apparatus.
Owing to the increasing conversion of
railway rolling stock to the new types of
cars, a, centralization of control would
bring about large economies. At the
same time It would eliminate the slight
element of competition which now exists.
CONSOLIDATION OF
CAR-BUILDING COMPANIES
The Real Cause.
The Immediate cause of the Mexican
war may be cald to be the message of
"Polk the Mendacious." in May. 1346. an
nouncing that "as war exists, and not
withstanding our efforts to avoid it. ex
ists by the act of Mexico herself, we are
called upon by every consideration of duty
and patriotism to vindicate, with decision
and honor, the rights and the Interests of
the country." But the remoter and real
cause will appear, from our study, to Ha
In the craving on the part of the slave
holdlntr States for room In which to de
velop their own peculiar Interests. It was
not solelyâ perhaps not chieflyâ for the
sake of extending slavery that they
wished for more territory. Loving the
Union. Southern men sought political
power even as did Northern men. They
saw the North growing by leaps and
bounds. Industrial development, immigra
tion wealth and the power which they
implied passed by the more stagnant
Southern States to spread their blessings
through the North. Hemmed In by the
restrictions of the Missouri compromise.
Southerners felt themselves forced to seelc
an outlet by territorial expansion to the
Southwest. But even with Texas gained
the end had not come.
These tortuous and undiplomatic pro
ceedings naturally deepened the resent
ment of Mexico.. She had already given
official notice that the annexation of Tex
as (whose independence Mexico had never
recognized) would be treated as cause for
war. This was disregarded, and differ
ences respecting boundaries were treated
by the United States In so grasping: and
overbearing a manner that a military col
lision on the banks of the Rio Granda
upon soil claimed by both Mexico and the
United States was made the occasion of
Inflammatory speeches In Congress over
the Invasion of American territory and
the shedding of American blood. War vas
then declared, and in spite of Whig and
Northern opposition to Texan annexation
and to violent measures against Mexico
the war once begun was generally popu
lar and was heartily supported by Kortb,
and South. It was an unbroken series of
military successes, which further In
creased Its popularity and tended to cloak
the dishonorable proceedings which had
led to It- â¢ .Â¦
lylers treaty of annexation was reject
ed by the Senate, but the determined
President, backed by the subtle Secretary
of State from South Carolina, was not to
be balked. A treaty with a foreign power
must have the approval of the Senate but
a Joint resolution of Congress may accom
plish the same purpose without that re
quirement. Such a resolution was passed
by a close vote and sent at once to Texas
for her acceptance. In the meantime the
people of the United States had declared
at the polls for annexation by electing
Polk, who had publicly pronounced In
favor of the 'â¢immediate reannexatlon of
Texas."
a friend at court la the President
himself. In spite of the apparent acqui
escence of Jackson and Calhoun and their
followers In President Monroe's paclflo
policy thay never really abandoned their
cherished purpose. The forcible acquisi
tion of Texas was plotted long before Its
accomplishment. After 1S23 the provincÂ©
was claimed as part of the new and weak
republic of Mexico. Offers of purchase
by the United States (one of which in
cluded the purchase of California) werÂ»
rejected. Colonization from the States
still went on. and Texas was secretly In
cited to declare Independence of Mexico.
In 1S29 Mexico decreed the abolition of
slavery throughout her borders. The act
was ignored in Texas, which had by that
time a large slave-holding population.
A Texas revolution waa finally effected
In the course of the years 1SS3-S6, In which
Samuel Houston of Tennessee, a friend and
fellow-soldier of Jackson.- was the real
leader, with the secret backing of the
President. Texas declared Independence;
American forces were sent Into the terri
tory on pretense of preventing an Indian
invasion .of the United States, and Con
gress promptly voted to recognize the
new republic "whenever she had proved
herself capable of maintaining a compe
tent civil government." while Calhoun
urged the Immediate admission of Texas
as one of the United States
Mexico was deeply offended ; her Minis
ter called for his passports, and In defer
ence to Northern protests the President
withdrew the troops from Texan soil Only
after years of delay was annexation final
ly achieved, in the manner we have seen
at the close of Tyler's administration. Cal
houn was again pressing the matter
Southerners professed alarm at some hu
manitarian remarks of the British Minis
ter at Washington respecting slavery, and
Calhoun decleared that the United States
must annex Texas if she would not see
Great Britain take possession. Thus the
South hoped to restore and augment her
waning power In Congress. At least four
slave-holding States might be carved out
of Texas and eight Southern Senators
added to the forces of slavery at Wash
ington.

big scores were made, and the shooting

bad luck in the match through having
hard birds, but he redeemed himself
afterward by making a splendid score in
a practice snoot. The glare of the sun

accounts for the light pcores. The result

J. C. Stamer of the Alamedas. H. C.
Guild of the Alamedas* had entered the
junior skiff race, but the AJameda Club
skiff being unfit fcr use he rowed tn a
dingey, and of course had no chance of
winning in auch a craft. However, he
feels so sure of his ability to beat his
competitors that he has issued a general
challenge to all of them to pull again at
some later regatta. Charles Wilson won,
though he stored a most erratic course.
J. C. Stamer finished second.

launch McNeill. The course was from a
line in front of and parallel to the Olym
pic boathouse out to Belvedere Point,
around the marks and back again across
the starting line. It was estimated at one
and a half miles, but probably was con
siderably short of that distance.
THE Olympic Boat Club was favored
with a beautiful day for Its aquatic
carnival yesterday at Belvedere. The
clubhouse was crowded with ladles,
while large numbers of spectators watched
the races from Valentines Island and from
the many yachts and rowboats In the

minute. They established a lead, ar.d
keeping up their fast stroke came home
easy winners, the .Â»riels second and the |
South Ends third. The Dolphins lodged
a protest after the race against the Ala
medaa for fouling them at the turn, but
the protest was not allowed. The Ala
medas were charged with turning the
wrong stake. The Alameda crew was
made up as follows: E. Hainan, bow; E.
B. Thorning. No. 2: H. C. Guild. No. 3;

Judge P. J. Reilly's black greyhound
Grafter, recently graduated from the
puppy ranks, provided the sensation yes
terday at Union Coursing Park. He out- |
6tayed Curtis & Son's blue dog Beacon, I
which had been played off the board by j
the bettore, and won by a score of 21 to j
13, after running two minutes and ten ]
seconds. Beacon ehowed the greater I
speed in the run up to the hare, but I
Grafter was persistent and tried all he i
knew. The hare proved an unusually j
strong one which the fleet dogs could not
break down. He first took them across
the field to the escape where the score I
was 11 to 1L Down the field they came j
again, Grafter working the hare and, al- j
though Beacon was at his flanks, he could I
not score. The hare made his way back j
to the place from which he was released ;
and finally sought relief in Slipper j
Grace's stand. The spectators cheered
the dog and his owner. Judge Reilly, and i
gave more cheers for his successful train- !
er, James Siverney. Grafter was not j
asked to run again, the stewards permit
ting his withdrawal.
The defeat of Beacon did not deprive
Curtis & Son of the stake, as Luxot
went through in dashing style. He ran
an extra course owing to an "undecided"
with Auckland. In the final he met J. P.
Thrift's Brutus, which he beat by a score
of S to 1. Brutus was four pounds above
his regular weight and ran in grand form.
Curtis & Son also won the puppy stake
with their promising young dog Anchor.
Bartels Bros.' Best Bargain was runner
up.
The first round was a hard one for the
backers of favorites. Flying Fox was the
first disappointment, being beaten at odds
of 10 to 1 by Jennie Wilson. Red Hind

Heine is not and has not been himself this

One of Hank's own crossed the plat" at

?-arned his first sack, going to the middle
station on Hildebrand's sacrifice and srir

Heine Krug, in his nervous attempt to
do prÂ«at things, gave the visitor? the:r

netted them four tallies. McLaugh'.in

Forty-one years ago the San Francisco
Schuetzen Vereln was organized, and yes
terday that event was commemorated by
a picnic and grand public prize shoot at
Shell Mound range. The'Vereln is one
of the wealthiest shooting bodies west of
the Rocky Mountains, and on Its mem
bership roll are the most prominent citi
zens of the Pacific Coast. The officers of
the Verein are: President, E. P. Rathjen;
vice-president. George Alpers; secretary,
K. Wertheimer: financial secretary, D.
Dunker; treasurer, H. Koster. Officers of
the schuetzen companyâ Captain, John
Thode; first lieutenant. H. Stalling; second
lieutenant, E. Ipsen j third lieutenant, D.
Salfield: fourth lieutenant, E. Goltze.
The company assembled early In th,e
morning at its headquarters and. marched
to the ferry, headed by a band'of music.
The families of the members went to
the park early and stayed late, there be
ing plenty of amusement for old and
young. Festivities were opened by a
speech by President Rathjen, who spoke
of the splendid history of the organization
and of its bright prospects. Then the fun
commenced. There was bowling and
dancing for the older and prizes for the
children and songs by the singer section
of the Germanla Club. The main attrac
tion, however, for most of the members
was on the rifle shooting range. In the
public prize contest cash amounting to
$350 was contested for. There were forty
cash prizes for the best centers, the sums
ranging from $25 to $1 50. Similar cash
prizes were offered for the most points,
and $40 was divided in eight prizes in pre
miums on the point target. There were
also $2 50 and $1 cash prizes for the rirst
and last bullseyes In the forenoon and
afternoon.
In the latter W. C. Morken won the first
center in the morning and F. Urandt the
last before dinner. J. Lankenau was so
close for this prize that it was hard to
tell which was the winner. The first cen
ter in the afternoon fell to D. B. Faktor
and the last to John Utschig. As near as
could be learned the most bullseyes of the
day and the prizes therefor were as fol
lows: F. P. Schuster 11, John Utschig 9,
A. H. Pape 9, D. B. Faktor 7. D. Saltield 7,
L. Bcndel 6. The prize-winners of the best
centers and most points will not be learn
ed until Wednesday evening, when the
tickets will be figured out by the com
mittees at California Hall. Besides the
public events, the members had a lively
competition for honorary prizes on the
company target. In this three shots were
allowed to each member on the 25-ring
target, possible 75. J. Lankenau carried
off the honors of the day in this contest.
One hundred and one members contested.

ADVEBTISEMENTS.
THE SIMPLEST CURE FOR IN-
DIGESTION,
As Well as the Safest and Cheapest.
The new medical discovery. Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets, digest the food instead
of making the worn out stomach do all
the work, give It a much needed rest, and
a cure of dyspepsia Is the natural result.
You get nourishment and rest at the
*ame time because these Tablets will
thoroughly digest all wholesome food
taken Into the stomach, whether the stom-
nch works or not. A cure is certain to
result because the digestive organs are
given a chance? to rest and recover their
natural vigor and. tone. The Tablets are
then no longer required.
To show the manner in which the rem-
edy acts on different people and how
quickly and effectually It cures stomach
troubles we present a few recent cases.
Mr. J O. Wondly of Pecrla, 111., writes:
I was unable to eat anything but thÂ»
plainest food, and even that often dls-
1 tressed me, but since using one box of
j Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets I can eat any-
thing and everythlnK I want.
Mrs. Samuel Kepple of Glrty, Pa.,
writes: I have been entirely relieved of
my stomach troubles by your Tablets. I
suffered three years with sour stomach
and gas at night. I am thankful for them.
Mrs. A. E. Bowen, Barnard, Vt., writes:
I think Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are the
best thing for dyspepsia I ever took. 1
will recommend them to any one troubled
as bad as I was.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets will not dis-
appoint because they cure dyspepsia sure-
ly and lastingly by causing the food to bÂ«
properly assimilated, and cure const'pa-
tion by producing the proper quantity of
bile, and sold by all druggists at 50 centa
per package.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
WOODLAND, May -20.â John Ashby,
Tutt, nearly 85 years old and a native of
Virginia, died In this city this morning.
The deceased came to California from
Missouri In 1849. He was the first City
Assessor of Sacramento and the first Con
stable elected after the organization of
Sacramento County. He served as chief
clerk of the State prison from 1869 to 1872.
He was not only a prominent and leading
citizen, but he was a member of the
Grand Lodge of Masons of California and
one of the most Influential members of
the order. He was one of the most active
organizers of the Grand Lodge of Cali
fornia, having been the principal delegate
from Connecticut Lodge No. 75 to the con
vention which organized the Grand Lodge
of California, and was elected deputy
grand master. He presided over the Grand
Lodge at the first annual communica
tion in May, 1S50. at which time he was
chosen grand lecturer. At the second an
nual communication of the Grand Lodge
of California, held on May 6 to 9, 1S51,
inclusive., he was elected most worshipful
grand master of the Masons of CaJlforni?..
which office he filled with honor and
credit to himself as well as to the entire
body of the craft. Â»
The funeral will probably be held on
Tuesday, but definite arrangements have
not yet been made. As Mr. Tutt was such
a conspicuous Mason his funeral will
probably be held under the auspices of
the Grand Lodge of the State.

Much Interest in the Event That Has
Been Arranged for Shell
Mound Park.
Much Interest is being manifested In
the Butchers' day celebration to be held
next Wednesday at Shell Mound Park.
The Oakland track has been engaged, as
well as the park for the racing events.
All the races have been arranged. Much
discussion arose as to entries, but this
has all been adjusted. The steer race will
probably be one of the interesting fea
tures, as an element of uncertainty re
garding the winner surrounds it. The
speediest of steers is likely to take fright
and turn back in the middle of the race,
allowing the common cow, with the snail
walk, to pass under the wire first. The
butchers' horse race, in which each meat
carver will drive his own pony, has also
attracted attention.
Gate prizes are numerous and valuable.
All the butcher shops in San Francisco,
Oakland and Alameda will close on the
day of the picnic. The crowd is expected
to be as usual, the largest of the season.

familiarity by biting a piece out of Davi

the Tennis Courts of the
California Club.
The California Club tennis courts were
the scene of several exciting matches yes
terday and many spectators had an en
joyable day's sport. Several of the best
players met in an impromptu singles

matches consisted of the best two in
three sets.
In the first play George Bradshaw out
played Merle Johnson at all points of the
game and defeated him by a score of 6 â 4,

result was often greatly in doubt.

Territorial Bill Will Prevent Many
Steamers From Trading With
the Islands.
HONOLULU, May 12.â For a time the
steamer freight and passenger service be
tween the islands and the coast will be
less convenient than it has been.. The
steamships flying foreign flags will not
carry freight or passengers between here
and the coast after June 14.
Hi Hackfeld &. Co. have already given
notice of this in respect to the steamers
of foreign registry for which they are
agents. The Hongkong Maru, due here
May 29 for the coast, will be the last of
the Toyo Kisen Kaisha line to carry
freight or passengers between here and
the coast, and the Doric, due for the coast
June 12, the last of the Occidental and
Oriental line of steamers to do so.
The Moana, sailing in connection with
the Oceanic Steamship Company's steam
ers, is in exactly the same situation. She
has foreign registry, flies a foreign flag
and therefore cannot carry freight or pas
sengers between here and the coast.
The regular mail steamers which will
be cut out of the freight and passenger
service between here and the coast by the
Territorial bill are the Moana, Doric, Cop
tic and Gaelic of the Occidental an*!
Oriental line, and the America Maru and
the Nippon Maru of the Toyo Kisen
Kaisha line.
The Pacific Mall steamers all have
American registry. So, also, have the
Australia, Alameda and Mariposa of the
Oceanic line. The Canadian-Australian
line is not affected, as their steamers go
to Victoria and Vancouver, and not to
American ports.
The inconvenience will not last for long.
The Oceanic Steamship Company is build
ing some tine new American steamers to
put in the Hawaiian trade, and so is the
Pacinc Mail. Some of these new steam
ers are expected to be in commission by
the first of next year.
SHORTAGE OF VESSELS
TO HAWAIIAN ISLANDS
The little schooner Prosper is the latest
addition to the Nome fleet. She has been
purchased from the Alaska Exploration
Company by a party of eight young men,
afthe head of which is "Joe" Freese, son
of Captain A. C. Freese. With him are
Captain John F. Helander, W. N. Letcher
and Alex Muns. Captain Helander will
go in command of the Prosper. He was
formerly master of the whaling bark
Hunter and - knows the Alaskan coast

barkentine Ruth north, but has relin-
The Rush to Nome.
The Peking brings the news that the
transport Warren, which left here May 1,
arrived in Honolulu a week later, and,
after remaining in port three days, sailed
again for Manila. The German ship
Marie, on which 70 per cent reinsurance
was paid, arrived in Honolulu May 6. She
was only seventy-six days out from New
castle, N. S. W.; but, as three vessels
which carried the same class of coal as
she did, had been on fire, the underwriters
got scared and began reinsuring.
Down in Honolulu the merchants and
the traveling public are wondering what
they will do as soon as Hawaii becomes
an integral part of the United States.
The agents of the Occidental and Orien
tal and the Toyo Kisen Kaisha companies
have notilied the public that their steam
ersâthe Coptic, Doric and Gaelic, and the
America Maru, Hongkong Maru and Nip
pon Mamâ will not carry freight or pas
sengers from the islands to San Fran
cisco, but will call as usual. The steam
ers of the Australian-Canadian line, which
run between Sydney, N. S. W., and Van
couver, B. C, will continue doing busi
ness at Honolulu as usual, but the chances
are that the Moana, a British ship of the
Oceanic line, will not be allowed to bring
any passengers on her June trip from
Hawaii. With the advent of the new
steamers now nearlng completion for the
Oceanic company the people of Hawaii
will be given a service that will make up
for the loss of the Ocidental and Oriental
and the Toyo Kisen Kaisha boats.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway. May 20.
The fruit growers of Alameda County
are determined in their new move toward
an org.'inizaiion that will destroy the
monopoly of the cannery trust. They are
enthusiastic over their meeting of last
evening, and they have every tight to
be, for the meeting was a success.
Meetings of this nature generally drag,
but there was nothing siow about that of
last night. The growers who gathered
there kiitw jubt what they warned, and
Keitltrd right down to work.. They knew
that they nad either to face low prices or
to organize, and they did not Hesitate.
There were speeches in plenty, and they
Â»Ht ail to some point. There was no
scattering of ideas, and every move that
va>Â» made was with a. purpose, beginning
with iht permanent organization and end
ing TVith the very' practical plan of secur
ing contracts upon the fruit in Alameda
County, and then farcing the canneries to
come to terms.
The growers will have to work fast
with this plan, for the warm weather is
ripening fruit very rapidly, and fruit can
not be stored Indefinitely, as the wine
men have done with their products. But
the canners must have fruit if they are
poing to make any profits this year, and
if the growers can corner the market
among themselves it will force the ean
iR-rs to a considerable extent, though the
perishable quality of the produce will al
ways mitigate against the growers.
The more active members of the com
mittees which are to secure the contracts
upon the fruit beeran work to-day. Nearly
every man who has up to the present time
taken any part in the two meetings that
have ben hÂ«-M has agreed to turn his
fruit over to the organization, to be han
dled for the benefit of all concerned. The
committees are now working with those
who were not present last r.ipht. and are
meetlne with considerable success.
The indications are that the required 75
per cent of the fruit will be signed for,
end that the canners will be compelled to
better their terms. Cherries constitute
one of the most staple canned fruit pro
ducts, and a? Alameda County practically
control! the cherry market of the State
thÂ«-r<> is h')pe Jn the hearts of the growers.
The feeling among the growers is unan
imously in favor of erecting an opposition
cannery, and although it is now too late
to carry this project out in time to han
dle this season's crop, step? in that di
rection will undoubtedly be taken as soon
as the more pressing need of disposing of
this season's output is completed.

ALL THE BLOWS IN THE
CORBETT-JEFFRIES FIGHT
v The showing made by James J. Corbett In his recent ring battle with Cham
pion Jeffries surprised the sportine fraternity so much that the comment has
not subsided. That Corbett completely outclassed Jeffries Is shown by the ac
companying table, compiled for the New York Herald. The blows were re
corded by an expert, and according to count Corbett landed 404 blows to 140 for
Jeffries. The table contains at least one inaccuracy â that in which Corbett is
credited with two knockdowns. Those were delivered by Jeffries. Had Cor
bett evaded the knockout blow Referee White could hardly have done otherwise
than declared him the victor. The table follows:

MYSTERIOUS MURDER
OF UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR
BROTHERS MEET AFTER
. YEARS OF SEPARATION
CHICAGO. May a.â Believing each oth
er dead, Cornelius Garson of San Fran
cisco and Isaac L. Garson of Chicago met
by chance at the Northwestern station
yesterday. Twenty-six years ago Corne
lius Garson left Chicago for the West and
went to Honolulu^ where he found his
knowledge of building and contracting in
great demand. Aft^r several years he re
turned to San Francisco and engaged in
business. In the meantime he had heard
nothing from his brother Isaac and be
lieved him dead.
Mr. and Mrs. Carson arrived in Chicago
yesterday en route to Paris. They were
walking on the platform at the station
when the appearance of a man standing
beside the gate attracted the attention of
Mr. Garson. He walked over to the man
and asked:
"Is your name Garson."
The man replied that it was.
"Don't you know me?" asked the first
speaker. "I'm Cornelius, your brother."
The recognition was complete and the
men threw their arms around each other
and wept for joy.
Isaac Garson had planned to go to a
suburban town, but the visit was post
poned and the long-separated brothers
and Mrs. Garson went at once to the ho
tel of the Chicago man, where an Im
promptu family reunion was at once or
ganized.

WeeHy Gall $1.00 per Year"Another Improvement in the new bat
tleships is the elimination of the 13-lnch
gun and the substitution of the 12-inch,
which is easier handled, longer lived and
less costly in firing, and yet quite as ef
fective. It costs $550 each time a 13-inch
gun is discharged. I am of the opinion
that the caliber of the guns will still be
greatly reduced, and that In ten years
improved 10-inch guns will be the heaviest
used in the navy. They can be handled
with greater facility, fired more rapidly
and made just as effective. Experience
has proved that rapid-fire guns are the
most effective. Marksmanship will be an
important factor in naval battles. Every
vessel must have some vital spots. Light,
rapid-fire guns can be so handled that
these spots can be reached more easily.
When a ship's vitals are pierced she can
be no longer in the fight.
"I am in favor of building ships in our
own navy-yards, not to the exclusion of
other shipbuilding yards, but to give
stead* employment to our workmen, and
thereby secure a force of men who will
be reliable and valuable. The repair work
in our navy has become an important
matter. When a vessel ends a cruise she
needs repairs, and the work must be done
properly. That means a large force of
men.* My idea would be to commence the
construction of a warship at each navy
yard, calculating that.it would require
four or five years to complete the work.
When a vessel comes*ln from sea and
needs repairs put the entire force at
work on It and finish up the Job. When
the work is done let the men return to
the construction of the new ship. In that
way we shall always keep men and ma
terials available for any emergency."
what the position of the vessel they can
be handled with equal facility. By means
of electrical appliances these turretB, con
taining guns that weigh from 400 to 500
tons, can be moved with great rapidity.
By a slight movement of the hand the
ponderous turret can be swung on a circle
with an arc of 3G0 degrees In one minute,
and stopped at any time on a hair line
without any damage whatever to the ma
chinery. The power is even at all times,
no matter what the position of the ship.
Tests have proved that a single heavy
shot landed on the tunet at close range
will not disturb the machinery; and it is
not probable that more than one shot
will be landed in the same place during
a battle, for the experts tell us that In
a radius of one mile the chance of one
ship hitting another is about 1 in 20.
Rear Admiral Philip Hichborn.
|7 X the opinion of Rear Admiral Philip
Hichborn, Chief Constructor of the
|^ Navy, this Government is making as
" rapid progress as possible toward the
position of foremost naval power In the
world. It now ranks but fourth, and if
the naval programme of Germany goes
through will drop to fifth place. But ten
years of such activity in the construction
of war vessels as is now being exhibited
will make a wonderful change, j England
comes first on the list now, with France
a close second and Russia third. The
United States Is a poor fourth, but she is
making great strides toward closing up
the gap.
The admiral likes to talk about the new
navy, in the construction of which he haa
been an important factor. . He It was who
was selected in 18S4 to visit Kurope and
study naval architecture and to secure all
the information possible for the building
of a navy of which the Government could
be proud. He was given full authority
to purchase all the materials and tools
that in his opinion would be necessary for
the work. He spent six months abroad,
and brought back with him plans and
suggestions that have since guided him in
his work.
"Since wo have entered upon this new
era of naval construction," he said In an
interview at the Palace yesterday, "over
300 war vessels have been added to our
navy, of which 200 were designed and built
by the Navy Department, and the re
mainder, principally .auxiliary vessels,
added through purchase. I have been per
sonally connected with the. designing of
every ship in the new navy, arid with
those under construction and contem
plated. We have now about sixty new
vessels under construction, varying. In
size from a battleship of 14,000. tons to the
smallest torpedo boats and the submarine
boat Plunger, which is an' improved type
of the Holland submarine boat, which has
proved so successful in 'a series of trials
extending over two years.
"The new naval bill calls for the con
struction of three new battleships of the
Pennsylvania class, which will be above
15,000 tons each, have a speed of nineteen
knots and will be the 'largest and most
powerful battleships afloat. They are to
be fitted out with the latest electrical ap
pliances for . auxiliary powerâ machinery
that now seems well nigh perfect â and
will carry twelve-inch guns of the most
Improved pattern. So successful have
the trials of the Holland submarine boat
been that the bill also calls for the con
struction of five more submarine boats of
an Improved type. This number does not
include the Plunger, which Is already
under way. The work now being done
will require probably three years to com-,
plete. although many of the vessels will
be llnlshed in much less time. -Just at
present the shipyards have all they can
I do.
"The progress of the age haa been won
derful. When I entered the Mare, Island
Navy Yard, in 1861. we were building
wooden ships. The transition from wood
to Iron and iron to steel has been so rapid
that it almost passes comprehension.
From auxiliary steam and sail power we
have paswed to full steam power and al
most mastless vessels, and now electricity
has entered the Meld and made the moat
wonderful change of all. > We have the
most powerful engines of war afloat that
the mind of man can design, but. we siill
know but little of the actual value of mod
ern arms and heavy guns. The late war
taught us little, because there was not at
any timo a stand-up fight between two
steel vessels. Such a battle would be
short but decisive. . :
"The chief characteristic of the battle
ships.riow. under construction will be the
wonderful electrical appliances used in
giving them auxiliary power. Here you
are building the Wisconsin and Ohio, and
in the East the Illinois, Maine, Alabama
and Missouri. They have inclining tur
rets, so evenly balanced that no matter

Max Metzl, an Oroville tailor, was ac
cidentally asphyxiated by gas in his room,
616 Bush street, yesterday morning. The
Coroner was notified and the body was
taken to the Morgue.
Deceased was a member of the firm of
Schlamm & Metzl, merchant tailors of
Oroville. He had lately come to this city
on business and was staying in the house
in which he met his death. He had an
aversion to gas and refused to use the Jet
in his room. He made a special request
of his landlady to furnish him with a coal
oil lamp, and he was using it when as
phyxiated. One of the gas jets was in a
deplorable condition. The slightest touch
would make the key revolve in its socket.
It is thought Metzl struck It while remov
ing his clothing, and did not smell the
escaping carbon-monoxide when he retired
to rest.
That his death was accidental is borne
out by the fact that his Sunday clothes
were placed on a chair at his bedside
ready to be donned the following morn
ing. Among the effects fiound in the room
by Deputy Coroner C. H. Flynn were a
number of cards disclosing his identity
and a bank book on the Humboldt Sav
ings and Loan Society showing- a credit of
$117 37. Deceased was deaf and dumb. He
was a native of Germany and about 25
years of age.

A Day's Session Saturday Included
Business, IÂ»unch. and the
Drama.
All of Saturday Golden Gate Hall was
filled with the members of the Alpha Sig
ma Sorority. There was a convention in
the morning, lunch at noon, a farce in the
early afternoon, and the rest of the day
was spent in dancing. It was the an
nual State convention of the society, and
the occasion was one to be remembered.
The annual election resulted in the
choice of the following officers: Miss
Elise Wenzelberger. M. D. S.; Miss Mary
Jewett. S. M. D. S.; Miss Maud Cheek,
treasurer; Miss May Norton, correspond
ing secretary; Miss Dorothy Jones, secre
tary; Miss Lola Wenzelberger, publisher
of the catalogue. This last office was the
outgrowth of a decision on the part of
the convention to publish yearly a cata
logue of all the members of the order. A
revised constitution, an Instrument mod
eled upon the former constitution, was
discussed and adopted.
After the business meeting: there was
an elaborate luncheon served by the city
chapter to Its four sister chapters, who
were, in everything but the business of
the session, the guests of the city chapter.
The absence of orthodox beverages Inter
fered not a bit with the oratorical part of
the luncheon, for lemonade was plentiful,
and served the purpose admirably. Miss
Klise Wenzelberger. the new presiding of
ficer, was toastmistress. Under her in
troduction the following toasts were re
sponded to: 
"The Sorority Spirit." Miss Margaret
Webb; "What Father Time Has Done For
Alpha Sigma," Miss Florence White:
"Chapter Extension." Miss Eunice Jef
ferp; "Innocence Abroad," Miss Effie
Kroll: "Sisters," i_. ss Kessie Pack; "A
Few Remarks." Miss Meda Block; "What
the Future May Have in Store for Alpha
SiKma," Miss Dorothea Wieland.
After the luncheon the farce, "A Pro
posal Under Difficulties." by John Ken
drick Bangs, was produced. The cast was
as follows: Miss Dorothy Andrews, Minn
IÂ»u Guthrie: Bob Yardsley. Miss Lilian
Aitken: Jack Barlow. Miss Anita Wie
land; Jennie. Miss Marjorle Dunn. Miss
Dorothea Wieland was stage manager.
She coached the actresses and superin
tended the Btagingr of the piece and the
scenery. It was a decided success.
It was a strictly "girls' affair," not even
a toast to "The Men" being on the pro
pramme: but it was as enjoyable as those
thine* always are. and the Alpha SiKma
looks forward to another reunion like that
of Saturday.
Circular Sent to the Various Schools,
Giving^ the Rules Governing
Spectators.
A circular of information regarding the
last of the athletic games of the gram
mar schools has been sent out to the
nchools of the city. The burden of the
circular Is "keep off the campus" and
"keep the children oft* the campus," but
there is other information. These facts
aro sat forth: The games will be held at
Kighth and Harrison streets at 2:30 o'clock
to-morrow 'afternoon. Seats are 25 cents
apiece, and they are reserved only to the
limits of certain sections. If any one
wishes a good seat in the section in which
he has bought a chair he will have to
go Â»Â»arly and get m>xt the outer rail. Fish
horns and school colors are recommended
to the school children as a means to make
a noise. To further the general din it is
suggested that schools fix upon some par
ticular side to each contest, in order that
thÂ»y may be unanimous in their rooting.
The events will be a five-inning baseball
game, a tug-of-war, a football game,
another tug-of-war. another football
Bame, another tug-of-war and the foot
ball windup.
â¢ Tickets may be had at the office of the
Deputy Superintendent of Schools The
games are for the benefit of the Teachers'
Annuity and Retirement Fund. The prizes
are valuable trophies. It is expected that
the tournament thus started will become
a permanent thing in the School Depart
ment.

In all the world thera is no' more lonely
spectacle. Alive, he is of interest only
that he may serve his term; dead, he
leaves no place to be filled, no memory to
be honored. His only privilege is to occu
py the grave no one can deny him; his
only favor is the prayer he so ' sorely
needs.
There will be no pall-bearers, white
gloved and trimly, uniformed: no band
wailing a dead march, no men with rifles
to burn powder over his open grave, no
bugler to blow the soldier's farewell.
There will be no flaRs at half-mast, no
sentries to salute, no man to doff his cap.
The wagon with its neglected load will go
through the lines unheralded and un
noticed; and the man will pass from
memory with the last shovelful of earth.
He may not even be burled In the uniform
which he has disgraced, and his body will
be hurried out of sight lln.e a thing un
clean. He is a man without a home or
friends or. country, and the record of his
death upon a ledger's page will be . his,
only epitaph.
The stern justice of a court-martial car
ries farther than life, for it can rob a
man oven of remembrance. Every
"general" military prisoner ia dishonor
ably discharged from ihÂ« army as part of
his sentence. Heing dishonorably dis
charged, he rnay not wear nor be buried
in the uniform, nor may he be accorded
any of the honors that are given the
soldier when he dies In the service. As a
prisoner, even though dead, his com
rades may not associate Â¦with him, and
he must go to his grave alone and forgot
ten. Even such of his comrados as may
have b^en his friends in life are not al
lowed to stand by his grave. He leaves
no place in the ranks nor In the quarters,
for he is carried on no roll. His horse
and his equipments have been given to
another; his uniform has been destroyed;
some one else sleeps In his bunk, and he
has not even the poor compliment of be
ing missed.
There is none so poor as a military pris
oner who dies before his term expires,
for even in death the ban is upon him,
and he may not be classed with his fel
lows. For the soldier honorably dead all
the pomp and ceremony, all the gold lace
and stripes and volleys and bugle notes
aro not too much to mark his passing;
but the prisoner must start on the mys
terious journey to the unknown beyond
with no friend to speed, no volley to
honor, no headstone, even, to mark the
snot where he is placed under the sod.
There Is no coffin provided to hold his
body, no caisson to carry it; instead, a
quartermaster's wagon will take a plain,
redwood box containing his remains up
the .hill, and that must be his funeral
train.
Some time to-day the body of A. C.
Bergin, the military prisoner who was
Bhot and killed last Friday while trying
to escape from his guards at the Presidio,

Mrs. Hichborn is making her first visit
to California and is delighted with the
prospect. She says. she feels no ill effects
from her journey across the continent.
Yesterday her apartments at the Palace
were filled with choice cut flowers. Many
friends and acquaintances called to pay

a charming hostess. She is looking for
ward with pleasant anticipation to a jour

Victoria, over the Canadian Pacific to
Duluth and down the Great Lakes and
the St. Lawrence : to the Atlantic sea
board. â¢..,
Rear Admiral Hichborn, though born In
Charleston. Mass., is exceedingly proud
of his appointment from the State of Cal

his manhood and served as a Journeyman
shipwright, master shipwright and As

of the old days. This visit, though long
deferred, and the renewal of old ac
quaintances, has for years been a cher
ished hope. Notwithstanding ljlg contin
ued employment so far from the Pacific
Coast, he has been ever In touch with its
interests, and being persevering as well
as progressive has done much to foster
and promote the welfare of the ship
building interests, both at the navy yards
and private shipyards of the West. While

*jp? W. PIXERO'S farcical romance
I \\ "The Amazons" served to display
II o the versatility of the Nelll
company at the CalJfornia Thea- ]
tor las=t nipht. James Xeill played a suboi> |
dlnate part. Ylsc-ount Utterly, and allowed
Benjamin Howard. Earl of Tweenwayea,
and George Bloomquest. Count de Grlval.
to carry off the laughing honors. Messrs.
Howard and Bloomquest developed unex
pected comedy ability. Their work was
a iÂ«urprlFe to those who have studied the |
N>ill company in the past six weeks, j
Frank ilacVicars and Emmett Shackel- |
ford made a tremendous lot of the small j
parts. The ladies of tile company were 1
revelations In boys' costumes and short \
dresses, Miss Dean and Miss Lamkin j
1 vaulted over a gate like real men. and
Miss Chapman punched Mr. Xeill in the
jaw as though she were an actual priee
tiehter. I>illia Andrew?. Marchioness of
Castlejordon, was capital a3 the mother j
who ordered her girls to be boys. "The
Amazons" was first given here by the
Empire stock company, and the present
production does not suffer by comparison.
The stage settings are as carefully ar
ranged as in all the Neill performances,
and the California will undoubtedly be
packed all the week.
The programme at the Orpheum is es
pecially stronff this week. Among the new
turns put on last night was the Magnani
family's musical act. Their act Is a novel
one. The curtain goes up on a barber shop
in which the members of the family play
popular airs and ragtime music on shav
ing cups and water pipes, with spittoons
as a bass accompaniment. They close
their turn by playing the "Pilgrim
March" on trumpets cleverly made up to
resemble barber poles. The members of
the Wilson familv are a clever team of
colored people. They took well with the
house, the children being especially well
received. Bartho. fresh from Paris, is a
clever dancer, and has that chic way with
her which only the vaudeville people from
that side of the world appear able to ac
quire. Kendall Is at the house for another
week. His songs and JokeÂ« are all new
and he makes a big hit. His experiences
vrhlle traveling to San Jose on the South
ern Pacific are very funny. The show
ends with some new pictures on the bio
graph. Some of the scenes of the Boer
war and snapshots of our boys in Manila
have never been exhibited in any theater
before.
