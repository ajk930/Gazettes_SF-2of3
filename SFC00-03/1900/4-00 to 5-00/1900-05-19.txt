BUYING UP PROVISIONS.
LONDON. May 18.â A special dispatch
from* Kroopstad, dated May 17. says: "A
clear case of, abuse of the' white flag has
been proved against some Boer prisoners.
They will bo punished. Lord Roberts In
tends making an Â¦ example of them. A
British patrol was fired upon from a house
flying' tho white -flag near Klipfonteln.
Three were wounded and three were cap
tured. The house has been burned."
The siege of Mafeking lasted seven
months and four days. ' The British gar
rison, under the command of Colonel R.
S. S. Baden-Powell, consisted of twenty
three officers of the British army, three
on special service or at their own in
stance, 600 mounted men. mostly colonial
pollce;'500 infantry, and a battery of field
artillery, 150 men with six guns and a
Maxim detachment, besides a battalion cf
white male residents, who were organized
for defense, and some companies of- na
tives. . .
' Colonel Baden-Powell, with Lord Ed
ward Cecil, Major Vyyyan and others had
been on the ground some weeks preparing
for offensive or defensive operations, as
the case might be.
The war began on October 11, and the
next day the Boers derailed and captured
the armored train at Kraal Pan, between
Mafeking and Vryburg, thereby cutting
off rail communication with Klmberley
and the south. On October 15 they seized
the water works at Rooi Groonel and by
the next day had practically surrounded
an<l Invested the town, and on the 21st
began a bombardment.
* On October 23 and 27 and again on No
vember 3 the garrison made sortie?
against the works, while the enemy were
gradually pushing In closer toward the
town, with some success and considerable
loss to both sides.
On November B the Boers made an as
sault, which \va-s successfully re'pulsed.
December 4, seeing no prospect for* near
relief. Colonel Powell put the garrison
and citizens on short rations.
December 26 the garrison made a night
attack on the. "sandbag" fort to the north
of the town, inflicting some loss on the
enemy, but suffering much themselves In
both officers. and men.
Regular bombardment was kept up
throughout almost every day excepting
Sunday, when by mutual consent 1 both
sides rested.
: March 31 Colonel Plumer's column of
1150 men from Rhodesia, on the north, ad
vancing to the relief- of the town, was
finally repulsed ' at Ramatulabama, eight
een miles from Mafeking. and fell back to
Mathudl. This hope destroyed. Colonel
Baden-Powell cut the rations, now . con-
Blstlng largely, of mule and horse meat,
and bran, still further, and waited for the
relief column from the south which Lord
Roberts promised should reach him be
tween the 18th and 22d of May.
Just when the relief column left the
Vaal River or who Is in command of it
has not appeared from the dispatches,
though It is surmised that It Is a. part of
Major General Hunter's force,, probably
under Colonel Paget. which crossed the
Vaal River at Wlno'sorton on the 8th
Inst. and reached Vryburg. about 103 miles
from Mafeking, on the 11th.
' As the relief column, of whose advance
they were kept advised ' by their scouts,
drew near the Boers redoubled their ef
forts" to reduce the town and the heaviest
fighting the Varrison has had to do has
been during these last few days.

. BALTIMORE, May IS.â The first intima
tion "of {he" relief of' Mafeking which came
to tho Boer envoys was conveyed to them
by a representative of the Associated
Press who .boarded the . Congressional
Limited, upon which they were being con
veyed to Washington, as It passed
through Baltimore. Abraham Fischer,
who acted as spokesman for the party,
read the dispatches from Pretoria and
London carefully, but without any show
of emotion. . *
"I have no comment to make at this
time," he said. "In the absence of official
information I much prefer to say noth
ing." ' . . . '.
"Would the news, If true. Indicate a
near approach of the end of the war?" he
was asked. - , . . .
"By no means,"- was the reply.. "There
is much to be done before there can be an
end to hostilities,, even, if ; Mafeking hus
been relieved."
... "Do .you agree with ; Lord . Roberts In
his prediction that the fighting will be
over by the Queen's birthday?"
"By no . manner of means, unless the
Knglish surrender," replied the .envoy, as
the train moved out of the station on Its
way to Washington.

don office at 9:1" p. m., and was instantly
dispatched to every quarter of the globe.
By 10;30 p. m. had come a response from
far-off Toronto d^erlbir.g the reception
of the news there. Â¦ This is not surprising
in view of the fr.ct thnt four minutes
after the receipt of the telegram here It

JoÂ«oph Chamberlain called at the War
Office after midnight and received a tre
mendous ovatic.n.
Important Operations. ....
The relief of Mafeking has had the
effect of suspending for a moment Interest
in the operations elsewhere In the field
of war. Nevertheless yesterday brought
important official announcements. Lord
Methuen entered Hoopstad Thursday. He
Is. now seventy milos from Kroonstad and
fifty from Bothaville. General Buller en
tered Newcastle Thursday evening. Lord
Roberts ie not Idle. 'While waiting fol
klores at Kroorstad he is using bis
mounted men to search a wide tract of
country. Colonel Uroadwood â¢ "occupied
Lindley on Thursday and> the same day
Colonel Il'jtton captured one of. the
Bothas. thirty miles from Kroonstad.
General Rundle on Thursday encamped at
Clocolan. British successes are thus re :
ported at every point from which news
came yesterday.
A Lourcnzo Marques correspondent tel
egraphed yesterday as follows: "New
peace proposals will probably be r>ut for
ward by the Boer Government. The re
cent reverses are causing despondency.
There was a prolonged meeting- of the
Transvaal executives at Pretoria Thurs
day and the destruction of the mines was
again considered. It is understood that
the Government does not intend to de
stroy tho mines."
According to other advices from th<Â»

PRETORIA. May 17.â There la a decisive
crisis In the war here. Lord Roberts" ad
vance from Bloemfonteln to Kroonstad
was practically an unobstructed march.
The Boers did not fight and failed to make
an effective stand anywhere.
At Brandfort the Boera retreated before
the British within rifle range, leaving
Colonel Blake's Irlsh-Amerlcar.s and other
out!anders to do all the fighting. These
lost heavily.
President Steyn personally endeavored
to induce the burghers to stand at Kroon
stad, but failed, they continuing to fall
back notwithstanding his appeal.
General Botha with a handful of brave
men protected tbe rear. Kroonstad was
evacuated for a day when the British were
within a few miles and the Free- State
capital removed to Heilbron. The war is
over so far as the Free State Is concerned.
The Boers have abandoned Natal and
retired to Lalngs Nek.
WAR OVER AS TO
THE FREE STATERS
. After retiring -to their rooms Mr. Fis
cher outlined to the representatives of
the press what they hope to accomplish
In the United States.
"We are," said he. "supplied with cre
dentials frcm our Governments and have
full power to act in a diplomatic capacity.
It will not be proper for us at this tlmo
to cay what our course will be before we
have taken steps to communicate with
those with whom we expect to deal. We
come In the interest of peace and a ces
sation of the bloody war. We an; en
gaged in a struggle with the country with
which your ration was engaged over a
hundred years ago and we feel that we
will have the rr.oral support of your peo
ple. The Boers will not give up the strug
gle.
"The Boers are wllllntr that this trouble
shall be settled by arbitration, and al
though an effort was made to settle It In
that way before the war began It was
without result. We are still willing that
the trouble shall be settled by arbitration
and are willing to abide by the result. We
are anxious that the United States inves
tigate the question of difference and use
Its influence to put an end to the war."

WASHINGTON. May 18.â Republican
managers have taken alarm at the sug
gestion recently made that the United
States Senate promises to be too much
in evidence at the Philadelphia conven
tion. Probably some other man than
Senator Spooner will be selected to make
the speech nominating McKinley.
According to the programme hereto
fore arranged five Senators are booked
for conspicuous places in the conven
tionâSenator Wolcott as temporary
presiding ofllcer, Senator Lodge as per
manent chairman, Senator Spooner to
mako the nominating speech. Senator
Hanna as chairman of the National
Committee, and Senator Koraker as
chairman of the committee on resolu
tions. â¢
These Senators, together -with many
others who have been appointed delegates
at large from their respective States,
would give the Senate a much larger
representation In the convention than is
deemed judicious by many Republicans,
who fear a repetition of the old charge
that tho rich men of the Senate are
dominating the party. . ,

Acting under the advice of the Board
ot Bishops, the committee on episcopacy,
at Its meeting to-day, decided to recom
mend to the General Conference that an
additional Bishop be elected to take
charge of the work In Eastern China.
This makes three missionary Bishops
which the coherence will be called upon
to elect at the present session. The offi
cial toj>e put in charge of Eastern Asia
will be located in Shanghai, China, and
will be required to spend four months in
Japan and one month in Korea each year.
The action will be presented to the Gen
eral Conference to-morrow. The commit
tee decided upon Zurich, Switzerland, as
the episcopal residence for Europe. â¢
Bishop AlcCabe. who occasioned con
siderable surprise several days ago by
preparing and riving oui for publication
a set of satirical resolutions referring to
the outside work performed by the Bish
ops, may be censured by the conference
for his action. To-day Chairman J. M. !
Buckley declared that the committee on I
episcopacy would inx-estigate Bishop ilc-
Cabe's action and report to the General I
Conference. He laid the case before the
tub-committee on administration of Bish
ops, together with a copy of the resolu
tions that have caused the trouble. The
sub-committee considered the matter at a
secret session and decided to follow the
edvice of Dr. Buckley and make a thor
o'Ugh Investigation. Bishop McCabe will. It
is said, be summoned before the commit
tee.
The result of the rlxth ballot for two
additional Birhops waÂ« announced this
incrr.ing to the conference, as follows:

end of the Fourteenth-street bridge.
Kenna had been drinking hard for several
days and to-night as a car on the Chou
teau avenue division of the Transit Com
pany was rounding the curve at Four
teenth and Gratiot streets he stepped up
to it andt drawing a revolver attempted
to shoot the motorman. The car was
going ,too fast- for him and he missed his
mark. He then began shooting at the
conductor and Special Officer Hollings
worth, who were standing on the rean
platform. ' "The officer jumped from the
car and walking toward the Intoxicated
saloon-keeper began shooting at him.
Four of- his bullets struck Kenna's body.
Kenna .continued to shoot at the officer
and the last shot he fired struck Hollings
worth In the left hand. One bullet, which
went, wide, passed through Nelson's ear.
Kenna was taken to the hospital, "where
the physicians dffered no hope of his re
covery. Â¦ . Â¦ Â¦ . i
Patrolman Henry E. Barton was shot
and painfully /wounded to-day on Jeffer

a few ' stones werejthrown and then sev
eral shots rang out. One bullet struck
Barton in the head." A riot call was sent
in and a squad of policed hurried' to the
scene. The - crowd/ which had gathered
iit-the sound of the shots. was dispersed
without 'trouble.'/; Barton was taken to a
drugstore, where '.an examination showed
that the bullet 'had "only made a scalp

- Cable Strands Severed.
;â¢ Shortly after noon to-<lay three cable
cars started east from the power house
of the Fourth-street railway on Eight
eenth street and Park avenue. At Fourth
street and Chouteatr avenue the cars,
stopped and upon investigation it was
found that the cable had been cut. When
the free end of the cable arrived at the
power house It was found that all the
strands had been severed, presumably by
a steel saw. The task of. splicing the
cable, and running it through the conduits
will be a difficult one, and the road prob
ably will not be In shape for a day or
two." â¢ â¢
General Manager Baumhoff appeared
discouraged to-day over the conditions
prevailing. "It is very dishearteninc" he
said, "to see how little protection a big
corporation can obtain for its property.
In my judgment, the militia should be
called out, for the police have demon
strated, to my satisfaction at least, that
they are not willing or capable of pro
tecting our property. However, I shall
not request that the militia be ordered
out, as I have become tired of making
requests." s Â¦

Reports of the various special commit
tees were presented and read. Among
the recommendations made 'by the spe
cial committee on the celebration of the
twentieth century, provision for a memo
rial fund was suggested, to be known as
the "twentieth century fund for endow
ment of Presbyterian collegiate and the
ological institutions, for the enlargement
of .missionary enterprises, for the erec
tion of church buildings and payment of
debts on churches and educational Insti
tutions, and for other work of the boards
at the option of the donors." It was sug
gested ' that provision be made for the
appointment â¢ of a central committee to
consist of four ministers and three elders,
with headquarters In Philadelphia, to
have general supervision of the work.
. Majority and minority . reports were
made by the special committee on the
method of apportionment of standing
committees of the General Assembly. The
majority report - recommended that the
standing committees be appointed by the
morterfttor, assisted . by a committee of
ministers and elders, the latter commit
tee to be also appointed by the modera
tor. This is the method now in vogue.
The minority report thinks it advisable
to divide the territory covered by the
General Assembly into twenty-two elec
tion districts, equal in size, by combining
the smaller synods and dividing the
larger presbyteries when necessary, for
the election of the standing committees,
each committee to select its own chair
man.
Just before the adjournment at â¢ noon
Rev. Frank W. Sneed, chairman of tha
committee on. arrangements, welcomed
the assemblage to St. Louis, and present
ed Moderator Dickey with a gavel made

day-newspapers on the Sabbath was de
clared to be one of the worst forms of

tions sent to Commissioner General Fer
dinand W. Peck and Embassador Qeneral
Horace Porter to close the United States
pavilion and offices at the Paris Expo
sition on the Lord's day and to endeavor
to secure concerted action of the Amer
ican exhibitors to the same end. He dep
recated the action of the French author
ities which have denied to the American
section of American exhibitors the right
to close their exhibits on the Lord's day
and have consented -To the closing of the
United States pavilion only, which Is dis
tinctly the property of the United States
Government.
The resolutions contained In the report
were adopted one by one. They, recom
mended among other things that the
Presbyterian church of the United States
abstain from the more popular and dan
gerous forms of Sabbath desecration, such
as advertising in the Sunday newspapers,
the purchase and reading of them and
from all forms of excursions, sports,
games and amusements on the Lord's day
and also : unnecessary* secular worn,
traveling and visiting, etc. A plea was
made to the railroad companies of this
land to abandon Sunday excursions so as
to secure the minimum of transportation
' ST. LOUIS, May IS.â A very consider
able part of to-day's session of the Pres

fect, abolished the time-honored rule of
the Methodist church that no pastor shall
occupy one pulpit for more than five years
and the liveliest kind of debate resulted.
A minority report was also read, provid
ing that a five-year pastorate could be ex
tended by the request of three- fourths of
the membership of the quarterly confer
ence and that a pastorate in no case could
be extended for more than a second term
of five years.
Over the paragraph in the minority re
port providing for a ten-year limitation
a wordy battle was waged. Dr. G. E.
Ackerman of the Alabama conference
made an eloquent argument in favor of
the amendment. Dr. Buckley favored the
adoption of the minority report as amend
ed, Â¦which in effect removed the time limit,
with the safeguard of a three-fourths vote
!:i the quarterly conference.
"If you remove the time limit without
restrictions." said he, /"you will be the
most detested General Conference in the
history of Methodism. Three-fifths of
Methodism is rural or semi-rural, and all
through those districts the people want
the time limit. To remove It entirely
would be regarded by them as in a way
class legislation in favor of the larger
cities."
Dr. Buckley was heartily anplauded as
he concluded. . The eighth ballot was then
read.
Assistant Secretary Penn of the Kp
worth I/paxuo withdrew the name of Dr.
J. XV. E. Bowen, the colored candidate for
the episcopacy. The ninth ballot was then
taken. The result of the ninth ballqt will

trust that the committee and the Senate will
proceed to the proper consideration of the
question so that the rights not only of Mr.
Clark but of the State of Montana in the
premise? may be determined and that, upon
the presentation of his credentials of appoint
ment by the Lieutenant Governor, the same be
tranyferred to the Committee on Privileges and
Elections for lnveetiKatlon, and that I be per
mitted to make a more complete and detailed
statement of facts concerning: the resignation
and appointment of Mr. Clark.
The. language of the resolution of the
committee directing Chairman Chandler
to press the resolutions as presented fol
lows: \
Resolved, That the chairman be directed to
press to a vote the resolution reported to the
committee. - ;,
ThfÂ» adoption of the resolution was pre
ceded by a discussion of the various
points involved in the controversy, in
cluding the proper course to be pursued
with reference to Mr. Clarit's credentials
when they are presented to the Senate.
The principal discussion was. however,
based upon the resolution directing the
chairman to cress the resolution hitherto
reported to the Senate from the commit
tee, stating- "that Mr. Clark was not duly
ana legally elected to a seat in the Sen*,
ate.*' The vote on the resolution stood 0
to 3, Senators Pritchard. Harris and Pei
tus casting their votes in the negative.
The Senators expressed the opinion that
the resignation of Clark had the effect
of definitely settling the case, and that
the Senate was not called upon to take
further action. Chandler. Hoar. Bur
iows. McComas. Caffery and Turley took
the opposite view. The discussion was
spirited and personal at times. "
There was no vote on the question of
the reference of the credentials under the
Lieutenant Governor's" appointment, but
there is no doubt that the committee
holds the reference should "be adopted,
especially in view of Governor-^gmith's
letter.
Senators Pritchard and Harris express
ed themselves as opposed to the refer,
ence of the credentials when they arrive*.
The principal participants in the con
troversy over the motion to press the
committee resolutions were Turley â¢ for
and Pritchard In opposition. Turley took
the position that when the Senate as
sumed jurisdiction of the case it no lonper
rented with Clark to determine it by re
signing, while Pritchard held that the
right of resignation was a personal right
and could be exercised at any time. He
also contended that the vacancy in the
seat occupied by Clark began when the
latter made the announcement of resigna
tion. There were some references to the
reaMpointmont of Clark by the 1-ieutenant
Governor, indicating the opinion on the
part of* some of the Senators that it was
not in accord with the Senatorial idea
of securing a seat in the Senate.

disregarded and revoked the action of
lieutenant Governor Spriggs in naming
Mr. Clark to succeed to the vacancy
caused by his own resignation, and that
he had named Martin Magfnnls of Helena

as his reasons his opinion that the ap
pointment of Mr. Clark by the Lieuten

and fraud. The dispatches are practi
cally the same, that to Mr. Clark read
ing:
"I have th!s day disregarded and re

Those to Prye and Chandler are of the

to Chandler, detailing: his reasons. He
has issued an open letter to the people

this afternoon.
The Chinese have given their opinion
of the convention in the following cards:
"The Christian Endeavor convention in
Stockton is very good. Full of life ana
enthusiasm. We enjoy it very much. It
will accomplish much benefit. The Chris
tian Endeavor takes great Interest In the
good of the human kind. Rev. Soo Hoo
Xam Art, Presbyterian Chinese Church,
San Francisco. Much pleased to come
to Stockton. Nice decorations. Very
good time first evening. Good work. L.
Jim. Fresno Congregational Chinese MIs-
sion."
To keep alive the spirit of Christian En
deavor in the older members it has been
decided to recommend the organization of
a veterans* association to be composed
of those who had been long in" the work.
A. . R. Waters. Miss Belle S. Angler and
E. C. Gilbert have been appointed a-com
mittee to make plans for the organiza
tion. Rev. T. F. Burnham of Vallejo
reported for the Floating Societies, a
movement organized ten years ago at Fal
mouth." Mass.. by Miss Antoinette Jones.
The first society was started on the Unit
ed States revenue steamer Dexter at
"Newport. R. I. Tho first society in this
State was organized in 1S92. At present
there is one station in San Diego, two
in Santa Barbara, two in San Francisco,
four in Oakland and five in Vallejo. Pro
visions are made for religious services
for sailors when on shore, and in many
cases societies are organized on ship
board. The* figures In State Secretar>
Reid's report showed the membership in
the different denominations to be as fol
lows:
Presbyterian, 7169; Congregational, 5953;
Christian. 3173: Baptist. 26S4; Union. 1G.T0;
Methodist. 1405: Cumberland Presbyte
rian. S91: United Presbyterian, K23;
Friends, 405; English Lutheran, 175; Afri
can Methodist Episcopal, 217; United
Brethren, 116; German Lutheran, 84,
Evangelical. 21; German United Methodist
Episcopal (South), 14: Episcopal, 6. He
said in conclusion: "Our union needs a
statistical secretary more angelic than I
who will attend to the work of organizing
societies and compiling lists of secreta
ries and societies. There is ample work
for the general secretary along other
lines." t
The Endeavorers are great singers. The
Salvation Army was out j singing this
evening when there was an open-air
chorus. by several hundred Endeavorers
on Hunter-street square. The Salvation
ists made no effort to run opposition at
the time, but later brought out their full
force And cannonaded the evil one in their
usual lusty manner, making their ex
hortations to. Endeavorers and sinners
alike. There is no disguising the fact
that the attendance is hardly up to what
was expected, but the committee take
consolation in the easy manner in which
they are entertaining and caring for .the
crowds.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON, May lS.-The local Meth
cdist young people and members of their
church organization. the Epworth League,
have been very active in entertaining the
visitors and making practical manifesta
tion of the fraternal spirit. As the Cen
tral Methodist Episcopal Church Is the
largest in the city, thfs spirit ha3 con
tributed not a little to lightening the bur
dens of the 1900 committee. There is much
talk of the desirability of the merging
of the two societies, but many of fh&
Methodists oppose it upon the ground
and the next place of holding the con
vention will be named.
President 'Coulthurst has announced the
committees as follows:

branch to take Nee'ey in this country and
return him to Cuba.
The view wa.-< general that the situa
tion In Cuba was most extraordinary and
complicated, as. while Spain had relin
quished sovereignty, the United States
had not assumed sovereignty and the
1'nlted States had not organized a sov
ereign government.
Chairman Ray laid before the commit
tee a brief bill, having but one section,
and providing for the surrender of of
fending oBlcials of Cuba when fleeing into
â¢the 1'nlted States. This and the Attorney
General's bill were considered at length.
General Wood says that the report from
Muncie. Ind.. that nearly J2.000.oOO worth
of stamps have been printed there and
sent for distribution to Cuban postofflcen
can be regarded as a canard. There la
nothing hero to show that any such coun
terfeit stamps have been sent.
Reeves' Startling Confession.
It Is believed row that the whole story
la known and that the amount of thÂ»
defalcation will fall between $100,000 and
$125,0u0. Thoxe who know the situation
best say that the confession of Reeves
was the only link required in the chain
of evidence, although the principal state
ments he has made will require Investi
gation before they can be acted upon, as
ft Is generally believed that hia accusa
tion is of such startling character aa to
render it unwise to proceed before being
absolutely sure of other evidence to cor
roborate it.
Another charge against Neely is that
he_ has defrauded the customs out of Â»ev
several thousand dollars of duties by im
porting, nominally for postal use. larce)
tjuantlties of paper which was afterward
sold to a printing house in Havana.
The Cubans are now beginning to tallt
a good deal regarding postal matter*, tho
main idea appearing to be that the Ameri
cans". havhiK found so manv of their coun
trymen implicated, will not proceed U> ex
tremities. The Cubans do not believe that
Neeley win be extradited. With thf con
fession of Reeves and Rich, supplemented
by tho?e of the stamp clerks and by the
statements of the Baracoa Postmaster, it
Is considered that the evidence against
Neeley Is complete, especially in view of
the assertion of Reeves that the stamps
were not destroyed when they were sup
posed to be. Packages which "were appar
ently, stamps were destroyed, and it Is
now said that they -were so many bits of
paper. The papers now begin to ask for
an investigation of the engineering de
partment. They say that this department
has been even more extravagantly con
ducted than the Postal Department.
HAVANA. May IS.â W. II. Reeves.
Deputy Auditor of the inland, made a
confession at midnight and gave up SJ500
given to him by C. F. \V. Neeley. the
arrested financial agent of posts at Ha
vana, to perform certain services the day
he left. General Wood and the postal in
spectors refuse to, disclose the nature of
the confession, barely admitting that a
confession has been made. It is claimed
that $1400 more will be recovered Immedi
ately.
WASHINGTON, May lS.-In accordance
with the request of Attorney General
Griggs, the Judiciary Committee of the
House to-day considered means to deal
with the Neeley case and like offenses
arising in Cuba. The need of action was
explained by the Attorney General in a
letter to Chairman Hay of the committee,
in which he said: Â¦
Â¦ Recent offenses of a criminal nature commit
ted by an employe of the r"*ta! service tn
Cuba, who has fled from Justice there and
taken refuge in the Pnited State?, make It my
duty, to call your attentlun to the fact that thÂ»
application of the i>reaent extradition laws of
the United States is In a condition ol doubt
and uncertainty, which makr-s it embarrassing
to the .Department ot Justice to secure the
prompt return of such orr?nilfcrs to the jurisdic
tion in. which the Â«-rin;e is committed anil in
which they t-hcul.l be tried.
It Is obvious that the lav.'* of the United
States ought to provide a sure and Â»p*edy rr
turn of !u*itive< from Justice v.'ho tiee from
Cuba and see': refuge in the United States. I
have drafted an act which will make the i-ourse
of procedure in such matters sure aru* certain,
and I respectfully ask that it l>e considered by
your commlttt-e and. If found expedient, that
k be Introduced and passed as speedily as pos
slbie.
Wide Range of the Bill.
The Attorney General's bill, besides pro
viding for extradition in ihe case of all
felonies and other crimes, [Â«ast and future,
against the penal code or the laws in
force on the Island of Cuba, contains a
section relating to; extradition -of fugi
tives between the States and Territor
ies and the islands in the posses
sion of the United States under the treaty
of Paris.
The discussion before Ihe committee
took a wide range, covering the status of
those officials who are performing- civil
functions while the islands are under mil
itary control. Some of-the members re
garded this military authority as so com
plete that it covered the cases of Neeley
and others and would permit the military
STOCKTON. May 18.â The second day i
of the Christian Endeavor conven
tion saw many more delegates in
their places, and while the work at
Â¦^ the session was principally confined
to the visitors and â¢ the members of
the local societies, the evening meeting
brought out about 4000 to hear the pro
gramme. The music is \ the best ever
heard in this city and the 200 voices sim

All of the superintendents and State'
officers rendered their reports of the
State union work this forenoon, and while
they are principally of a statistical
character, they showed all branches of
the society to be In a flourishing condition

enthusiasm, or rather divide the affec
tions of the young Methodists. The va
rious denominational, rallies this evening
would indicate that this opinion is at
least subject to question, as the sect fe
ver and enthusiasm was. quite evident at
the meetings. ,
It is a very quiet crowd. Although.it
is estimated that there are 2000 here,
were it. not for the decorations about
town the presence of visitors would not
be noted except between the sessions of
the convention, when they go to and fro
over the city. However, it has been a
busy day and the people will probably
see more of them to-morrow. As usual
the women folk predominate 3 to 1 in
the throng-, t '
The delegates from Santa Ana to-day
distributed badges bearing the words
"Santa Ana'' 1901." There is no opposition
to the choice of Santa ATia for the con
vention city next. year. Fresno is said
to desire the convention for 1902, but there
has be,en little talk upon that subject yet.

The Driver's Story.
CHINESE CAMP. May !'.â In an inter- I
vlerr with William Walton, driver of one j
. rf the Yosemite coaches which were held {
up last evening he gave h'.s account as j
follows: :
Last evening while coming leisurely
alcr.gr the prrade loading- to Moffitt's bridge
hâ¢ oDverved the other stape at a stand
still, but thought it had stopped for him
to pas:= by, bu: upon approaching nearer
anu seeing all hands up he at once in*-
formed Ills passengers it was a hold-up.
The highwayman ordered him to drive un
closer and fcr all the gentlemen to alight
and turn their pockets inside out, which
was promptly done. One gentleman
pleaded for t5 very- persistently-, where
upon the lone robber placed the gun at.
bis -breast and exclaimed: "Take a dollar
and walk." One of the passengers having
presence of mir.d dropped a. purse con
taining 540 in the bottom of the stage.
None of the ladies were molested. .
Sheriff Price and a. posse v.'lth a blood
hound are now in pursuit of the lone ban
dit. Tliis is the first robbery that ever
occurred on the Big Oak Flat route to
Yosc-mite. The stage company has offered
a reward of Â£300 for the capture of the
highwayman. \
About fifteen >ears ago John' F. Stevens,
present guardian of Yosemite Valley, was
driving from Wawona jo Yosemite Valley
and was held up and robbed by two high
waymen. Great excitement prevailed at
the time, but the robbers escaped.

LITTLE ROOK. Arlc. May IS.â In the
United States District Court to-day Judge
John A. Williams imposed a judicial sen
tence of six months upon Guy Miller and
Alden Hayes for contempt of court In
having boarded a street car and inter
fered with the non-union motorman, who
are employed by the court's officers now
operating the system, it was contended
by the defense that the motorman and
conductor were not on duty at the time,
but the court held that it made no differ
ence and that the receiver's employes as
such are entitled to the protection of the
court at all times. The court further de
clared that the further use of the term
"t-cab." as applied to non-union employes
who are under the court'? protection, was
in Itstlf very near contempt and must be
stopped. ..

A week ago the Whitney brothers and
the Hardys felt certain that they would
go to Chicago for the big middle western
championship tournament "which will be
played on July 8. 0. 10 and- 11, but
conditions are such to-day, that there is
a great ; deal, of doubt felt 'by all con
cerned, whether or not the Eastern trip
will prove a- fact. â¢ :
James P. Gardener, manager of the
Kenwood Country Club, made- glowing
promises to the four, crack racket wleld
ers of the West when in San Francisco
a few weeks ago. His terms at that time
seemed agreeable to -the. Hardyg and the
Whitneys,.1!ut now on a second consid
eration of the proposition those- men tlnd
the expense, to be borne by fhe Ions trip
Kast greater than they : care 'to ' meet.
Gardener wafe anxious to 'secure the
Westerners for the tournament.' and he
may be induced to offer better- terms.
The tennis men think he will. The Cali
fornia Club is also anxious to have the
local cracks go to' Chicago and- represent
the club there, and .with this. end in view
a subscription has been talked of to llll
out the sum necessary for the trip.
One of the biggest tournaments, in the
history of,. the California Club will be
played Decoration day on the club courts.
It has been decided to make it open to
all-comers,, a singles, without handicaps
or classes. Invitations, wni be' sent out
to the well-Known players all over .the
State, and etfer'y' effort will bÂ« "made to
have the tournunftnt a complete" success..
The Whltneys. the. Hardys and all the
clever lesser lights will be; on hand.
This tournament will be a. prelude to
the championship- event of the year
which will be played either at San Rafael
or San Jose' during the early, days of
July or the I last days of June, according
to the realization or failure of the- pro
posed'trip to; the East. Â¦-. .

sardines are becoming plentiful in Monte
rey Bay. The salmon always follow the
smaller fish, hence good- sport is in. pros
pect. , . . ...... -
Striped- bass are plentiful in Petaluma
Creek and in Oakland estuary. Some 200
men fished from the railroad pier last
Sunday. A number of 15-pound fish were
taken. ': '
Lloyd Eaton, the 'well known fisherman
and all round sportsman, sailed on Thurs

William Roehr. Richard Henning and
Julius Falting. three well known grocers
of the Mission*, have been successful
cs cod fishermen recently. Point Blunt
was the scene of their operations. Of the
three Mr. Roehr was the most successful,
securing thirty-three fine flsh, which he
distributed among his friends.
The boating season will be inaugurated to-morrow over a new course at Belvedere, the va
rious clubs about the bay contributing their best scujlers and bargemen. The regatta was orig- j
inaliy projected by the Olympic Boat Club, but it developed so rapidly In Importance that It was
placed in the hands of the regatta committee of the Pacific;' Association, -Amateur Athletic Union.
The seating arrangements used at the celebration of "A Ni&ht in Venice" still remain, thus af
fording spectators a clear view of the course without the inconvenience to which they have here
tofore been subjected on regatta Cays. Under such favorable conditions the opening day cannot be
other than successful.
A sportsmen's convention will be held
In this city," commencing on Thursday
next. It is expected to do much good in
suggesting tho legislation necessary for
the preservation of flsh and other game
which is found in almost endless variety
within the borders of this State. The
officers of the State Fish Commission took
the initiative In the matter, inviting dele
gates from all over the State. The idea
is to frame a general law which will cover
the varying- conditions which are found
throughout, the State. As each county
Board of Supervisors was asked to name
two delegates there will be a general In
terchange of ideas, which -must bring
some good results in their train.
The persons invited tosit In the con
vention have responded quickly, and with
few exceptions havÂ« promised to attend.
The number of "birds to be bagged In one
day, the protecting of English snipe, the
regulating of deer-shooting and other
matters which the genuine sportsmen feel
need attention I will be discussed.- The
Supervisors, of .the .various counties, have
worked independently in framing laws
and filling the statute books. It is hoped
to get one law governing the whole State.
Tho shooting at Inglesidft' to*morrow
will be done by members of the California
Wing Shooting Club and the Lincoln Gun
Club. The former will shoot live birds,
while the latter will smash blnerocks.
The members of Burlingame Â¦ Country
Club will hold their second pigeon shoot
for the Carolan cup on their grounds on

DOC SHOW PROTESTHOLDS
The protest of J. W. FTynn against the
award at tho recent show to Alec Colvln's
pointer Lady C was considered at a spe
â¢cial meeting of the bench show committee
of the San Francisco Kennel Club beia
â¢ It was intended to open the new eipht
een-h'ole course, of the San Rafael Golf
Club to-day with a match between two
teams, each of six men, representing the
San Francisco and Oakland Golf clubs.
Tho absence of C. P. Hubbard and George
D._ Greenwood prevents the Oakland Club
from making up a really strong team.
The project has, therefore, been aban
doned, and for the. present at least the
golfers of San Francisco and neighbor-'
hood will lose the pleasure of seeing an
interesting contest. Meanwhile the quali
fying rounds of the competitions for the
Council's, cups for men and women are
proceeding. In the case of the ladles the
first nine holes are played in the morning,
and the second nine in the afternoon. On
Saturday, June 2, in addition to the play
for the Council's cups, there will be a
handicap competition, medal play, for the
ladies who have played qualifying rounds
for the Council's cup, but do not reach tht,
final round. It will be over nine holes
and open to all but the winner of .the
Council's cup contest and the runner-up.
Now that less golf is being played in
San Francisco and neighborhood than
during the winter and spring the number
of visitors to the links at Del Monte.
Santa Cruz, Santa Catalina and other
places has increased.
The course of the Santa Catalina'Island
Golf Club has been much improved, sev
eral of the holes having been lengthened.
The first hole, named Cruz, which was
210 yards, Is 2C6: the second, Miguel is
lengthened one yard; the third. Nicholas,
is 18 yards longer than formerly; the
fourth teeing grourid has been moved
nearer to the mouth of the ravine and to
the third putting green, which has been
remade and is now in the center of the
plateau. A fourth hole, named Anacapa,
having a distance of 157 yards, has been
put In between Nicholas and Catalina
which is now the fifth hole. The fair
sreen leading to the fifth hole avoids tho
rock-encumbered ground and is on the
farther side of the plateau. Clemente, the
old fifth hole, is the sixth, and has been
lengthened, the old sixth hole being left
out altogether. From the seventh teeing
ground ithe drive is acnoss Â¦ a shallow
ditch, then an iron shot to the precipice
and over with a lofter. It is hardly possi
ble, however, to loft on to theNgreen, and<
though the, length of the hole is only 334
yards tho golfer who makes It In six

The eighth hole, Barbara, is 230 yards, as
before, and the ninth. Gundalupe, has
been lengthened from 185 to 201 yards, v

SENATORS AND
FRISCO ON THE
LOCAL DIAMOND
The Change in Harris' Team
Looked Upon as a Marked
Improvement.
Sacramento leads the California Base
ball League at this early stage of the sea
son with a good, comfortable percentage.
Unless* the other teams pick up in their
game the Senators are likely to hold what
they have earned. From the tail end Sac
ramento crept straight up the column to
the top. Not only have the Capital City
men the crack twirlers of the league, but
they have a well-formed and harmonized
team. /
It by no means follows that the other
clubs are out of the race. By consistent,
good playirg all of them have a chance
with thechampions. but as d* rule some
thing seems to happen. to the opposing
team at the wrong moment. The season
has been under way long enough for all
the teams to have reached form and there
should be no excuses on this score. .
Though the San Francisco' ball-tossers
are trailing along after tlte. other league
teams "Uncle"' Henry find? solace in the
little table which shows the games that
have been won and lost. He points with
pride to the fact that his team has won
four out of the seven games played
against the champions and- leaders and
argues that having aceomplrshed that it
should be conceded that they are capable
of playing fast ball even though they are
at the tail end. The Sacramento* have
been beaten by the Stocktons in only one
game and but a single time by the Oak
lands. ' . ' ..
The standine of the clubs to ' date is
shown in this table:
The Sacramento and Frisco ; teams will
play the string out at Recreation Park
this week and the result should be
watched with considerable interest. The
Sunday game will be the tenth meeting
of the season and the champions .will
have to win two -of this series to split
even with the locals. "Hank" Harris is
intent upon preventing an even break and
he will require Iburg to do the twirling in
two of the contests. In the Sunday game
Iburg will be In the box against Jay
Hughes and there should therefore be a
pretty exhibition of box work. Pabst, the
new captain of the Friscos. will make his
local debut to-morrow and Henry Krug
will be back at shortstop, McCarthy hav
ing left the team.
The line-up for the game to-morrorw is
as follows:

The league has just tasted the bitters of
an umpire crisis, but a ready attempt has
been made to correct the' evil. . Jack Don
ovan was given a chance at it. but he
signally failed, on this side of the bay.
Dor.ohue was tlien tried and h!s first work
last Sunday was seemingly satisfactory.
Tile Dan P. Carters, one of the best
known amateur teams of this city, will
try conclusions with Vacaville's nine at
that town to-morrow. On the following
Sunday tha Carters will play the Ter
minal \Yheelman of Stockton at the Six
teenth and Folsom streets grounds. Both
games should bÂ« extremely exciting and
their outcome will be watched- with inter-
I on the 16th inst. The board of directors
j had previously delined the field trial class
t as being only for pointers and setters thÂ«t
had been placed tirst. second and third in
some recognized Held trial, and this defrt
nition left th<? bench show committee no
alternative .other than to sustain the pro
test. This was done and the cup presented
by the Pacific Coast Field Trials Associa
tion wap then awarded to J. XV. Flynn's
pointer dog Senator P.
The office of the San Francisco Kennel
Club at 223 Montgomery atreet will be
open to-day from 3:30 to 5:30 p. m. for the
payment of prize?, after which all com
munications should be addressed to the
secretary, II. H. Carlton, at Xapa.
It has been definitely decided that a
bench show "will be held in Oakland in
September, to be closely followed by the
show of the California State Fair Asso
elation. Both these shows will be held
under American Kennel Club rules and
the present prospect is that an extensive
circuit of the A. K. C. shows will shortly
be arranged, to include with these cities
Stockton. Fresno and L<os Angeles.
Dr. A. R. Bailey of Seattle has bought
N; H. Hickman's English setter Count
Harold, by Harold out of Countess Noble.
It is greatly to be regretted that this fine
animal cannot be exhibited at A. K. C.
shows, because of the disqualification of
his breeder. H. T. Payne.
Coco, the Japanese spaniel which took
the second prize in the open class at the
recent show, is dead, and Thomas II.
Stevenson will find some difficulty in reÂ»
placing this tiny animal.
â¢ Another death is that of the Eskimo dog
Nuggets,* the property of Harold R.
Brown. Nuggets was the center of at
traction at the show and Mr. Brown re
fused several good offers for him.

Epecial Dispatch to The Call.
PRINCETON, N. J.. May 18.âTo-mor
row morning the California team will go
to Philadelphia, where it will meet the
strongest athletic team in the countryâ
that of the University of Pennsylvania.
Pennsylvania is this year to send her ath
letes to Paris, -where they will compete
for the world's championship. Of course,
our- team 6tands no chance of winning
from them, but it is going Into the games
with the spirit of "never say die."
Physically the Californlans are In good
condition, but they have had some acci
dents. Hoffman's leg, which was sprained
last Saturday, is improving slowly. He
will not attempt the pole vault, but will
take a few trials in the high jump. Â¦Wool
sey will not be able to compete in the
shot-put on account of a sore arm, which
was hurt when ho fell Jn the hurdle race
last Saturday. This bad luck would be
enough to defeat us even If our team were
as good as that of our competitors. These
two men should be good for at least fif
teen pointsâ in fact, they are the surest
point-winners In the team with the excep
tion of Plaw. .
All the rest of the team are in better
shape than they have been before this
season. The boys profited wonderfully by
the coaching, which has been so kindiy
rf ndercd by Captain' Crcgan of Princeton.
The California boys ar<; disgusted with
the treatment they have shelved from
Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania, mana
ger has' seen our helples3 condition and
has taken advantage of it. He has done
things which he would not even attempt
with Eastern colleges. He has entered
I two menâ Baxter and Mechlinsâ who are
[ not eligible to compete. California will be
compelled to compete on account of finan
cial troubles. The following are the en
tries, with the i words of their men:

XEW TORK. May IS.â Chaxle* (Kid)
McCoy easily defeated Australian Dan
Creedoa at the Broadway Athletic Club
to-night before one of the largest crowds
that has ever assembled in the club.
Thirty-four .seconds of the sixth round
Â¦was all the time needed to turn the trick.
(Lnd McCoy could have brought the fight
to an earlier conclusion had he been so
disposed. Creedon made a poor showing.
At no time did he land a. blow that hurt
McCoy.
The opening bout between Tommy Feltz
of Brooklyn and Harry Bresnick of New
York, scheduled as a twelve-round fight
at 10o pounds, was a short affair, ending
in the second round In favor of Keltr. Tiie
referee declared Bresnick outclassed.
Creedon was the first to enter the ring,
B-ccompanJed by Dal Hawkins, Denny
Murphy and Joe Caine. A few minutes
later the "Kid' came through the ropes
â¢with his brother Homer. Billy Muldoon.
Jo*- Falvey and "Â¦Jimmy" de Forest as
eeconds. Both looked to be in pood shape.
When the bell sounded the "Kid" start
ed in with clever feinting and foot work.
He had a emlle on his face, but Creedon
looked serious, and was the first to land
with a srood left to the wind. McCoy
danced away and came back with several
jabs to the face and body, and then
crossed his right to the head.
Creedon was inclined to mix things In
the second round, and twice landed his
left to the head. McCoy jabbed And tried
hard to reach the jaw with his right, but
Dan held a h!ph guard. The "Kid"
reached the stomach with his left.
In the third McCoy began jabbing his
right to the wind, but was blocked when
he tried for the Jaw. Dan kept going, but
was unable to land a punch until later
In the round, when he reached the body
with a light right. A left hook on the
eye broug-ht blood and sent Creedon on
hi* back, but he majiaged to get to his
feet and etay the round.
McCoy did not seem inclined to rush
matters In the fourth, and Dan finally
cornered him and swung a hard left to
the body. McCoy returned a left hook to
Dan's Injured eye and backed awi'- wjen
Dan rushed- Creedon was very tired at
the bell.
McCoy opened the fifth with a left to
the body, but Dan blocked his right swing
and returned a vicious ewin^ for the

head, which McCoy ducked. The "Kid"
then swung his left, but was wild, and
was laughed at by the crowd. Dan swung
a good left to the head and the "Kid"
countered with his right to the body and
repeated the blow when Dan crowded in.
McCoy came to him for the sixth with
the evident intention of finishing it, and
jabbed his left to the face, followed by
his right to the head. He then forced
Dan around the ring, but Dan sent him
away with a right swing to the neck.
McCoy was right back with a right to
the body and then hooked his left to the
Jaw, sending Dan to the floor. Creedon's
seconds, seeing he was defeated, threw
up the pponge and McCoy was declared
the -winner.

friend Joe Harvey of the fact that war
rants had been issued for himself and
Simpton on the charge of perjury. Judg
ing from his demeanor. Adolph Sylva was
unaffected by the news. It was not so
with SImpton. He was visibly perturb
ed, and the thought of prison bars star-
Ing him In the face as the possible result
of his actions in thf celebrated case
caused him to chew his cigar nervously
and return Incoherent answers to ques
tions. When seen to-night Sylva profess
ed to tr^at the whole matter as a joke.
"SImpton and I will go to the city to
morrow morning," he stated, "and give
ourselves up."
When asked about the $10,000 bond Sylva
said he would put up c-ash bail himself,
ns Joe Harvey would furnish the coin.
Sylva laughs aloud at the Indictment, and
the defiance which has marked his man
ner throughout the case becomes even
more pronounced than usual when he re
fers to the Grand Jury, and snapping his
lingers in his characteristic manner chal
lenges justice to do her worst. Up to to
night the warrants had not been served.

FAIH CASE STTBmTTED.

made the closing argument for the Fair
heirs in the forenoon. He gave a little of
Emil Burcard Cut in the Abdomen
and Two Brothers Are Under
Arrest.
During a fight at Griffith's saloon, 427
Broadway, at midnight. Emll Burcard,
an employe of the American Biscuit Com
pany, was stabhed In the abdomen, prob
ably with fatal result. Angelo Capltelli
and Alphonso Capitelli, brothers, were ar
rested.
Burcard made a statement at the Har
bor Receiving Hospital, saying he was
drunk and asleep outside the saloon. The
accused men struck him, and a fight fol
lowed. He was not sure which man
stabbed him, but the police found a
pocket-knife covered with blood In Angelo
Capitelll's pocket.
After the fight Burcard and the Capl
tellls, pursuing him, ran to a house at 19
Ohio street, where Special Policeman Gil
len and Patrolman McShane broke in and
found them. Burcard is unmarried, and
lives above the saloon where the fight oc
curred. The men under arrest are iron
founders.
SALOON ROW ENDS IN
A SERIOUS STABBING
1KDICTMEXTS were returned yester
day by the Grand Jury against Mrs.
Nettle R. Craven for perjury. O. W.
SImpton for jjerjury and Adolph Sylva
â¢for subornation of perjury. Judge George
IL Bahrs fixed ball at $10,000 in each case
and ordered bench warrants to Issue
'forthwith for the arrest of the accused.
! The charges jtre the direct result of the
'Grand Jury's Investigation of Mrs.
[Craven's claim that she was married to
Â¦ Senator James G. Fair by SImpton, a
'Justice of the Peace at Sausalito, in July
Â¦ or August. ISA. She is accused of giving
"false testimony before the Grand Jury
jin 6 wearing that such a marriage ever
t(x>k place. Sirnpton is charged with hav
Â¦ing sworn false-iy to an affidavit in which
fhe made oath to the alleged facts of the
|Â£ausaJito marriage of the, Senator and
;thÂ« school teacher. Sylva. the picturesque
.friend of Poolscller Joe Harvey, is called
(to answer upon the accusation that he
!lnduced Justice Simpton to make the al
'leged perjured affidavit, knowing that the
: sta.tements of Simpion were untrtie. The
â¢Indictments were drawn several days ago,
jas appeared from the dry ink In which
;they were written. They were read yes
iterday afternoon to the bare quorum of
igrand jurors present. The date of pres
entation was inserted only a few minutes
before the return was made to the pre
siding Judge. District Attorney Bylng
ton's only request to the court was that
:bail be rixod at $c'Â«X) in each case, but
Judge Bahrs overruled the suggestion by
doubling the amount.
The coÂ«nt against Mrs. Craven was em
*bodied in half a dozen closely handwritten
pages of foolscap. The document brimmed
over with all Mjrt? cf legal verbiage, the
pist of which team to say that Mrs. Craven
j-erjured herself before ths Grand Jury on
March 7, when she was under Investiga
tion.
This investigation followed on the heels
of confessions made by Sirnpton ar.d
Sylva that the etory the Justice had told
of the Sausaiito marriace wa.s false and
that he never performed such a ceremony
as both Mrs. Craven and himself had
Eworn was celebrated.
The indictment runs over the history of
Mrs. Craven's present contest to secure
a family allowance from the Fair estate
and recite? that the Grand Jury had
called her before it as a witness under
inquiry concerning a charge that she had
perjured herself before Judge Troutt in
ewearirig that the Sausalito marriage was
a. fact. The gist of Mrs. Craven's tesu
rnor.y before the Grand Jury is presented,
being the same as she gave in court. Then
ehe is charged directly with the knowl
edge that her evidence was untrue and
that Jn fact she was not married to Sen
ator Fair on that occasion or at any other
time by Justice Simpton.
The particular affidavit involving Simp
ten was rr.ade on August 12 last year be
fore Notary Harry J. Lask in the office
of XV. \V. Foote. one of Mrs. Craven's
counsel. The indictments cover in- the
criminal court jurisdiction the chief feat
tire of Mrs. Craven's attack in the Pro
bate Court to secure recognition as Sen
ator Fair's wife. They hinge entirely
upon the Incidents surrounding the Sau-
Biiilto marrlape. so called.
Although "Mrs. Craven" Is the person
accused in the indictment, her name ap
pears in the list of witnesses examined
T)y the Grand Jury as "Mrs. Nettle R,
Fair." The other witnesses were W. W.
Foote. J. J. Lermen.. G. W. Simpton,
Adolph Sylva. George A. Knight. Joseph
Harvev. Charles L. Fair. IÂ»uls F. Dir
n:*nd. Lafe Pence. Thomas P. Boyd. Mrs.
jt;izabeth R.. Roy, John Falconer, Charles
K. Clark. Mrs. E. I. Foster. Henry
Koehler Jr.. D. M. Delmas. Wells Drury
ar.d S. C. Der.?on.
The explanation of Sylva has been that
the SImpton affidavit was procured in or
der that Mr?. Craven might be entrapped,
and as Foon as she had committed herself
to the Sausalito marriage exposure of the
plot was to be made. The programme
Â¦was followed la that a contradictory
sworn statement was filed by Simpion.
who ma<!e an alleged admission that the
original storv was false.
The following grand jurors presented
the indictment!*: J. W. Cnrmany, V.. R.
Ttock. L. Attached. J. II. Bremer, H. J.
Burns. P. D. Code. H. P. Flint. P. F.
Kingston, C. F. Lurmar.n, A. J. Van der
his time to George Crothers, who opened
the day's argument, his remarks dealing
with the handwriting exhibits and the
testimony given by the experts. Mr.
Crothers has paid especial attention to
this feature of the case. He said there
â¢were many erasures and breaks in the
alleged signature of Fair attached to the
marriage contract, while in the acknowl
edged- signatures of the. dead millionaire
there -were no erusures and no breaks,
saved those caused by the skipping of the
pen.
Attorney Pierson spared neither- Mrs.
Craven nor her witnesses and referred sar
castically to the list of names of the lat
terÂ«in Mrs. Craven's alleged memorandum
book as the "roll of honor." During his
argument he said:
"If Mrs. Craven and Fair were mar
ried at Sausalito why does her counsel lay
so much stress on the matter of their as
suming: marital relations? This is all un
necessary if the alleged ceremony across
the bay took place. It appears to me that
her attorneys have abandoned the Sausa
lito wedding.
"The date of a. woman's marrlasre is an
important thlr.p In her memory. That any
woman would forpet that date Is prepos
terous, but this petitioner says she can
not remember that of her Sausalito mar
riage.
"Counsel may denounce SImpton, Sylva
and Dunand. I don't care how bad they
are, but that damnable fact against Mrs.
Craven, the $"0,000 contract in black and
white, is there, undisputed. .Â¦
"The story of the/ alleged signing of the
contract before Craig, if it were not for Its
revolting perjury, would be the most gro
tesque recital ever hoard In a court of
justice. Senator Fnlr, almost on the pub
lic streets, shouts his secret into the ear
of his deaf notary. I don't think Mrs.
Craven was In Chieauo at the time sh*Â»
swears she saw Senator Fair at the Grand
Pacific Hotel. I think from all thp testi
mony given that she and Morgan Thomas
lied when they swore to her seeing Fair
there. "It looks strange that at a time
when Chicago was so crowded that people
were sleeping on cots Â¦ a public parlor
in a leading hotel should be void of other
occupants for nearly two hours.
"Don't you think that Judge Sullivan
would have remembered the signatures*
on those contracts had th^y borne any?
Mrs. Craven <lrew them with the Intention
of blackmailing Senator Fair. She first
submitted them t<v Judge Sullivan and
then In her room forged to one of them
the name of Fnlr. The genesis and evolu
tion of this forpery are seen in Mrs. Cra
ven's notebook."
Mr. Piersor paid some attention to H.
N. Bryant, the "hobo witness." during
which* he referred to him as an "Infa
mous scoundrel."
"Neither busy detectives, thieves nor
perjurers must infest these courts any
more. It rests with you. Judge Troutt.
or some other Judge in this building to
s<Â»e to this. That Judge who will do this
thing without fear of the push or pull
or moneyed Influence will have trje respect
and love of the people," were the closing
words of L,.nfe Pence's argument/ He
dwelt not at all on law. but- devoted hlm
pelf to the testimony and 'witnesses, say
ine in part:
"Did you ever see a band of liars who
seemed as proud of their, work as Svlva.
SImpton and Dunand? Governor Budd
talked of their testimony being- that of
three to one as against Mrs. Craven's.
More than one witness Js not needed to
overcome three liar*. One truth will kill
a thousand lies. When Dunn.nd faced a
-writing he had to collapse. The opposi
tion has spent with lavish hands and reck
less extravagance thousands of dollars.
Will this court Indict Mrs. Craven of for
gery despite her honored years on the
testimony of the hired band of perjured
criminals nroduoed here?
"After the perjurers what comes next?
Some guesses of handwriting exnerts.
Their testimony is not worth anything,
as this court knows. Has not the Supreme
Court just held In the Starke case that
the court had eyes and .should use them
when handwriting was In question? Ames
told here at so much per 'tell' of things
none of the rest of us could see. Luckily
the correspondence of Fair produced bv
Mr. T>ermen shows that the dead Senator's
writing Is full of characteristics that
Ames said were entirely absent from it."

It is clear that the billboard nuisance
will have to be abated In Cleveland. Signs
have been put up In places where they are
nothing loss than the disfigurement of val

Pending suitable legislation to. stop this
abuse of the freedom permitted in the
erection of signs, it might be a good thing
for the Park Commission to place wooden
or canvas â¢ screens in front of thÂ«> out
rageously big and staring signboards,
fronting the Rockefeller Park drive, near

CUSTOM has established the rule that about this
time in the yc.ir of Presidential elections politi
cal experts shall make forecasts of the Novem
ber vote. Generally the calculations are interesting
because the issue is one of doubt. This year there is
hardly any doubt as to the outcome, lput still long
custom has made the people expectant of the usual
predictions, and accordingly they have been forth
coming.
General Grosver.or of Ohio, who forecast the re
sult in 1896 with an accuracy that established his
credit as a political prophet, has recently estimated
that in the coming election McKinley will receive
260 electoral votes, being 36 more than are neces
sary for election. There has also been issued a Bryan
forecast, which claims for Bryan 196 sure votes, con
cedes McKinley 1G8 sure voies, and leaves the rest
doubtful.
The Grosvenor estimate is conservative. It claims
for McKinley California, Connecticut. Illinois, In
d:ar.a. Iowa. Maine. Massachusetts, Michigan, Min
nesota. New Hampshire, New Jersey. New York.

Virginia. Wisconsin snd Wyoming. It will be seen
there i? ro rainbow chasing in that estimate. Doubt
ful States iike Maryland. Kentucky. Delaware. Kan
sas and Idaho are put in the Bryan column. Even if
all of their, be lost the Republican party can elect its
candidate with thirty-six votes to spare.
The Bryan forecast, which limits McKinley's sure
votes to 168. does so by putting New York, Indiana,
Ohio and Minnesota in the doubtful column. The
calculator might just as \veÂ«?l have claimed them for
Bryan. His must be a mind which delights in dubious
things who seriously claims there is any doubt how
Ohio or New Yprlf a- i 1 1 vote on an issue which is
essentially the same as that of 1896.
Senator Lindsay of Kentucky, a stanch Democrat
in his way, is quoted as having said recently: "Any
body can beat Bryan; the people are afraid of him."
That is about as good a judgment upon the situation
as can be given. The election of Bryan would disturb
business, industry and financial affairs in every part
of the country. That much is well known. The peo
ple are now prosperous, and they know that the way
to preserve that prosperity is to maintain in power
the party whose policies established it. So strong is
the popular distrust of Bryan that if there were any
imminent danger of his election even the Southern
States would vote against Tiim. Thousands of Demo
crats will support him only because they do not wish
to abandon their party and they know he is going to
San Francisco is even unique in her footpads. One
of the genial gentry who operate in the dark is ac
cused of stealing postage stamps.
The one notable feature in the Grosvenor estimate
is that it gives McKinley a vote which will awaken
Republicans to the importance of earnest work in the
campaign. For election there will be needed 224
electoral votes, and the estimate is that the Republi
cans will receive thirty-six more than that number.
Now New York alone has thirty-six votes. If that
â¢State be lost, together with even so small a State as
Wyoming, the victory will be with Brj'an, There is
ro danger of the loss, for the State is not doubtful,
but nevertheless the calculation is of a nature to rouse
Republicans to activity. The margin of majority is
too ftnall for the party to afford to leave anything to
chance.

Tliere is a report that the New York Democrats

Our local fraternity of footpads, is becoming more

ACCORDING to the sixteenth annual report of
the United States Civil Service Commission,
covering the fiscal year ending June 30, 1899,
"while exact figures cannot be given as to the num
ber of positions affected by the order of May 29,
1899, it is estimated that the number of competitive
classified positions at this time is not far from 80,000,
while the number of unclassified positions is approxi
mately 102,000, including positions created and still
existing as a result of the war with Spain." It is
added that of the unclassified positions 71,007 are oc
cupied by fourth class postmasters. The annual ex
penditures for salaries in the executive civil service
for the year ending June 30. 1896. were $99-717,055.
and for the year 1899 they are estimated at $104,000,
000, the increase being due to the war.
The cornmission reports that comparatively little
progress has been made toward the adoption of the
rules provided for making promotions in the classi
fied service. Most promotions continue to be made
from motives of favoritism or from the effects of
outside influence. The commission says: "Promo
tion regulations cannot be put into force as required
under the civil service act and rules without the full
co-operation of the officers in the different branches
of the service, and it is deemed proper to state that
the commission has not met with that co-operation
which is necessary to a fulfillment of the requirements
of the law in this respect."
A feature of the service which perplexes the com
mission and the higher officials is that of getting rid
of Government employes who are too old to rightly
perform their duties. It is said that in the execu
tive departments of the national capital alone there
are 1416. employes who are over 60 years of age and
forty who arc over 80. The presence of these men in
the offices affects the efficiency of the public sen-ice,
and it is felt that some means should be provided for
getting rid of them without in any way inflicting a
wrong upon them or, leaving them dependent in their
old age.
An effort was at one time made to provide for the
retirement of the superannuated employes by estab
lishing a civil service pension rqll. but the movement
was not supported by Congress. It is now suggested
that a system be devised by which a certain percent
age of the salaries of the employes shall be withheld
each month, thus creating a fund by means of "which

Xew York City during a run of several months at the Empire

Mr. John Drew in "The .Tyranny of Tears."
rROM the discussion of the negro problem by
the recent conference at Montgomery good
auguries can be drawn for the future of the two
races in our Southern States. It is true there were
many pessimistic speeches made and some foolish
ones, but the majority were hopeful of a fortunate
solution of all the difficulties in the issue, and.
moreover, much of good advice was given in the way
of devising remedies for existing evils.
Upon the words of the pessimists it is hardly worth
while to dwell. There were speakers who declared
the negro to be rapidly degenerating into barbarism,
that educated negroes born since emancipation have
more criminal tendencies than the former slaves, and
that the only possible salvation of the Southern States
lies in the deportation of the blacks. Against that
creed there was a vigorous protest from the more in
fluential speakers, and it is to their views the atten
tion of the public will be mainly given.
Upon the subject of negro suffrage, which is one
of the more important phases of the general problem
of the relations of the two races, ex-Governor Mac-
Corkle of West Virginia said: "The franchise sys
tem, as it is at present constituted in many of the
States of the South, is, to say the least, practically
the policy of repression. Repression has been tried
at every stage of the world's history, and always with
the same unvarying result, utter and tremendous
failure. It leads nowhere. It raises no man. It de
mands no education. It holds ignorance as dense as
ever. It drives away intelligence. It breeds discon
tent. It represses any rising inspiration of the heart.
It leaves the land at the end of the cycle just as it
found it at the beginning. It is the policy of deadly
inaction overridden by discontent."
'Such words from a Southern statesman addresse-i
to a Southern audience arc cheering. They show that
in the South itself there is a strong sentiment in favor
of maintaining for the negro the privilege of voting
and using that privilege as a means of advancing his
political education. Mr. MacCorkle admitted there
should be some restrictions, but he counseled that
these should be in the nature of educational and tax
paying qualifications imposed on white and black
alike, to the end that all who desired to vote might
acquire the privilege by study and industry.
Hardly less important than the question of suffrage
is that of lynch law. and it is. gratifying to note that
Alexander C. King of Atlanta, who opened the de
bate and made the principal speech on that issue, de
nounced the evil in strong terms and pointed out the
demoralizing effect it has upon the community as a
whole. Summing up the results of the practice he
said: '"Irregular and lawless methods of settlement
grow in favor. As the law is less looked to for pro
tection, men become less careful in their choice of
the offenders of the law, and latterly demoralizing
methods and practices are permitted to obtain in
their section. Can any one wonder that such acts hays
a baleful effect and multiply the very crimes they seek
to repress? Can we wonder that the ignorant believe
only a part of what the intelligent say, and are easily
taught that the innocent negroes are the victims of
prejudice and passion? Do we not see that this
course is simply cultivating crime and laying the
foundations of a far more serious race hatred than
that which was builded on false promises? That we
cannot substitute force for law? And that society is
being sacrificed by the excesses of its own defenders?"
Upon the subject of education it was argued by Dr.
Frissell that if the education of the negro has thus far
been disappointing it is because he has been educated
in the wrong direction. He has heen taught to read
and to despise manual labor without being taught
how to earn a living. Industrial training for both
whites and blacks and the upbuilding of a diversified
industry throughout the South will, in Dr. FrisseH's
estimation, bring about a remedy for all the evils now
complained of. He attributes the crimes of negroes
and the lawless lynching on the part of the whites to
idleness and ignorance. Give .work, wages and a use
ful training to all, and there will be an end to the
race problem.
Such is the counsel which the South has receive 1
from her own leaders at the Montgomery conference.
That it is essentially, wise cannot x be doubted. By
suffrage regulations which arc fair to both races and
which give every citizen an opportunity to share in
political privileges, by the suppression of lynch law.
and by industrial development, the South can find a
solution for most of the evils that now beset her

THE CANNERS 0ND THE GROWERS, j
THERE is rumor of an issue between the canners
and fruit-growers of this State affecting the
prosperity of the growers through the price
offered for their fruit.
The Call desires to do no injustice to the cauners.
but to promote justice to the growers. The great
canning cempauies have combined and operate as one
organization. This removes competition in the or
chard for the fruit, on the tree or off. It may and
should mean such economies in the canning business
as will amount to a fair profit on the whole pack.
There is a possibility of wholesale purchase of tin
and its manufacture on a large scale, and the whole
sale buying of sugar, eolder, boxing, labels and other
requirements of the business, such as would effect a
very large saving. The operation of the business from
a common center of administration is another
economy of considerable importance, and not to be
overlooked. All of these savings should be look;d
for as the result of combination, and to them the as
sociated canners should look for the most of the profit
and benefit to come from the aggregation of their in
terests. To look further for profit in their power to
force down the price of their raw material below the
cost of production, or so near to the line of cost as
to leave no satisfactory margin to the grower, is a
policy which if entered upon will be regarded by the
public as reprehensible. The risk in the business is
taken by the fruit-grower. He is exposed to drought
and flood, to frost and north wind. The moths,
worms, flics and scales, the fungus and the very birds
of the air and beasts of the field, attack his trees and
vines. He must irrigate or drain, smudge against
frost, plow and prune, spray and dig, thin and pick, to j
get his. crop. It is perishable and must pass promptly |
from the tree to the can. He can't hold it for a mar
ket, nor carry it over to another year. It falls soon
an^l is worthless. The canner runs no risk. He
knows the pack of last season still in sight, and he
knows the world's average consumption and judges
how much must be packed to supply it. This carries
a fair knowledge of the prospective price at which
the market will take the pack. His business is a fair
certainty from start to finish. Its risk is small, and
its profit is fairly estimable before a can is made and
filled.
It is against business morality that the grower who
takes all the risk shall be deprived of profit. He has
but few and inefficient means to protect himself. The
market cannot take his fresh fruit in such quantities
as to materially affect the canning supply. True, he
can dry it, but that process is subject to more of risk
and accident.
Fruit is the glory and the gain of California, and
when its producer is unfairly treated the State is a
loser.
The canners are business men, astute and trained.
The grower has had but little time spared from the
toil of production to study commerce in his product
or digest business methods in passing it to the con
sumer. He is wise in the ways of production only.
If it be true that the canners. are leagued to seek
an improper profit in the defenseless and unfortunate
condition of the growers, the situation will not last
more than one season. If the time be too short now
for the growers in each district to organize and do
their own canning{,it will be clone next year, and we
admonish the canners that the capital will not be
tacking to enable them to do so.
This State cannot permit the fruit-growers to be
despoiled. They arc the land-owners, taxpayers and
consumers, the solid foundation of the State's pros
perity. Without them and their patient and enter
prising industry there would be no canners nor can
neries, no pack to put up and none to export. The
time has gone by when a State can permit the destruc
tion of a leading industry by the avarice of any com
bination. Capital itself understands this, and the at
tempt to squeeze the growers by the canners will
bring capital to the rescue of the men who take all
the risk of the business and without whom an annual
product worth over twenty millions will be destroyed.
All this is said not to aid in spreading the rumor
of the policy intended by the canners, but to discuss
what may come if that rumor be true. We do not
affirm that such a policy is entertained, but if it be it
would better be abandoned before it is, put into action.
The story of our triumphal arms in the Philippines
has adorned many a tale, but romance pales into
matter of fact when we think of Major Forbes
stretching his avenging hands across the Pacific
Ocean from Vancouver and laying low in the far
away Philippine fields of battle the followers of
Aguinaldo.
those who become inefficient through age may be re
tired from service and a reasonable amount be paid
them, monthly for their support. Inadvocatingtheplan
the commission says: "While under the civil service
act and rules inefficiency is considered a just cause
for dismissal, appointing officers naturally hesitate to
dismiss old employes>vho have become incapacitated
after rendering long, faithfuland efficient service, but
it would seen* that some provision ourIu to be made
so that the work of the Government may not be em
barrassed by their retention."
For itself the commission asks for an increased
office force, the right to employ expert examiners
and to have control of them, a supply of standard
textbooks and works of reference which are needed
because the commission is. now called upon to hold
more than 200 different kinds of special and technical
examinations, more ample office accommodations at
Washington, and an increased appropriation for trav
eling expenses. The reasons given for these requests
are good. If we are to have a Civil Service Com
mission we ought to furnish it with the means re
quired to perform its work to the best advantage.

TFIERE have been few large transac
tions in real estato to record dur
ing the last week. The great pro
ject of the -Produce Exchange for
replacing the Merchants' Exchange build
ing with a larger and splendid building
has progressed! There is still some work
to be done in the way of securing slgna
j tures to the ngTrement to Join the larger
association to be formed by the mer
chants, and little will be done In that di
rection until the committee to appraise
the property has made a report. This
may be some days hence. Until a price
has been put upon the property there will
be no business proposition to present to
those who are expected to associate
themselves with the present members of
the Produce Kxchange and other owners
of the lot and building in the new enter
prise.

Merchants' Association Furnishes
City Officials With Valuable
Data on This Matter.
The Merchants' Association has sent to
the Supervisors a report of the street
sprinkling experiments made by L. M.
King, superintendent of the association,
together with recommendations as to
how this work should be done when the
city lets the contract. In the first place
the experiments demonstrated that the
sprinkling of streets paved with bitumin
ous rock in the matter of laying the
dust and without making the pavements
slippery for travel was practical. The
secret of success In this line depends
upon the good Judgment of those who
manipulate the sprinkling carts in
placing the right quantity of water
where most needed. Upon the use of
salt water the following appears:
We rave during this experiment used salt
water between the car tracks from. Third to
Fifth streets. The results confirm our previous
experiments in this line, that for basalt blocks
or cobble struts In particular. It Is far su
perior to fresh water for sprinkling purposes,
and it is to be regretted that more mains and
hydrants from which it could be procured are
not located at accessible points.
Upon the matter of the present ordi
nance the report says:
We bee to advise your honorable board that
as a result of our experiment* we believe the
ordinance prohibiting the sprinkling of bitum
inous rock streets should be rescinded.
The association has also drawn up
specifications for the sprinkling contract
and says:
We estimate that 130.000 will be sufficient to
perform this work the first year, and we earn
estly as=k your honorable board to appropriate
this amount for sprinkling In the next tax
levy, and thus not only add to the comfort and
health of our citizens, but relieve San Fran
cisco of one of the reproaches of our visit
ors of being a "windy, dusty city."
The directors of .the association appro
priated $ioixÂ» to make these experiments
and furnish the city officials with a prac
tital object-lesson. The organization will
carry on this work until the city Is
ready to take up and continue the same
permanently.

TRANSACTIONS IN REALTY.
The Overdue Steamer Ig-nacio Llarescil.
STRIKE OF MEN
AT THE DUNDON
CREOSOTE PLANT
They Walk Out, Claiming
the Bight-Hour Law Is
Violated.
The refusal of their employer* to heed
the eJght-hour law is the cause alleged for
a walk-out of laborers last night at thÂ«
creosoting works of P. J. Dundon at the
foot of Powell street.
The men claim that Dundon, who has
contracts with the Harbor Commissioners
for creosoting piles for wharf construc
tion, has violated the law by compelling
his employes to work eleven hours a day
Instead of eight, refusing to pay them
overtime. '
The contractors assert that the men
have been employed on United States Gov
ernment contracts as well as on State
jobs and that it is upon thÂ© former work
the longer hours are demanded.
Whatever the facts of the controversy
it remains that there- is much dissatisfac
tion among the. workmen. Last week four
were discharged for refusing to work more
than eight hours unless overtime were al
lowed. Last evening at 6 o'clock the new
crew laid down their tools and left the
works.
The contract with the State Board of
Harbor Commissioners requires that all
work done shall be paid for by the con
tractors at the rate of $2 a day of eight
hours for laborers. The wages of all other
employes are also Ret forth. The laborers
are making the fight for theW claimed
rights under this contract. They declare
that Dundon is the only contractor who
is not adhering to the State law.
William Hamilton, residing at 2114 Pow
ell street, is one of the men discharged
last week. He said:
"The men are required to work eleven
hoursâ that Is. from 7 o'clock until 7
o"clock, with an hour for dinner. And It
doesn't matter whether it Is State work
or United States Government work. If the
contracts for the United States Jobs were
all the men had to go on nothing could be
done, but the State law is plain and the
contracts with the Harbor Board plainly
show what scale shall be paid.
"Myself and three other men were dis
charged because we refused to work more
than eight hours a day, without overtime.
After we were let out we went to Labor
Commissioner Myers and laid the case be
fore him. He said he would Investigate,
but all he ever did was to hear the con
tractors' side. They said that the men
were only compelled to work overtime on
the piling and timbering for the Govern
ment tidal canal work at Alameda.
"When we asked for overtime Dundon
said there were plenty of men willing to
work twelve hours and If we didn't like
the job we could leave. The men do not
like to see one' contractor refusing to
heed the law when all of his competitors
do live up to it. We fully understand
that on the United States Government
contract Dundon can work his men as
many hours as he can induce them to
labor, but on a contract with the State
matters are very different. We have failed
to receive satisfaction from the Labor
Commissioner and the Harbor Commis
sioners have shown no disposition to en
force the terms of the contract, which are
being violated. All the Labor -Commis
sioner did was to subpena Dundon and
his foreman. None of the complaining la
borers got a hearing."
Labor Commissioner 'Â¦ and Harbor
Board Accused of Failure to En
force Contract Schedule for
Time and Pay.
The Mexican Steamer Igna
cio Mariscal Is Overdue
From Mazatlan.
HEWS FROM THE
OCEAN AND THE
WATER FRONT
THE SAN FRAXGISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MAY 19, 1900.
ThÂ» old collier Alice Blanchard. now the
Mexican steamer Ignacio Mariscal. Is
giving: her new owners some uneasiness.
She !s out eleven days from Mazatlan, and
la some quarters it is feared that her sup
ply of coal is running short and that it
may l>e a week before the vessel gets
here. Then, again. Jt has been blowing
very hard from the north for several Mays
esd the Ipnacio Mariscal's boilers aro in
no condition to drive the hull through a
heavy wind and a head sea.
The Alice LUnnchard was laid up In Oak
land Creek -when the people from Mexico
bou^hf her. The pressure on her boilers
had been cut down to euch a low ebb that
co tirnft could be made with her. so she
Â¦wes laid up. Her new owners looked her
over, gave an order for new boilers and
Then decided to make one trip to Mexico
while the boilers were being built On
March 24 she accordingly left here for
Manzanlllo and way ports. From the
Line Phe passed through the Golden Gate
until now there has been more or less
trouble. ThÂ« food was bad and the butter
Grove the men out of the cabin. Charles
Judge, one of the crew, quit the vessel at
uuaymas, and at the next port Captain
Daniels threw up his Job and came back
to Ban FranÂ«:sro. First Officer Bowen is
now m command and is bringing the ship
home.
Philadelphia Back Again.
The cruiser Philadelphia arrived in port
unexpectedly yesterday morning. At the
navy pay office she was not looked for
before the middle of next week, but ehe
made th e run from Pan Juan del Sur in
the rir.e time of twelve days and came to
an anchor off Foisom-street wharf about
fc a_ m. The Philadelphia left here on
March 11 for Central America. Trouble
was brewing between Nicaragua and Cos
ta Rica and fighting was liable to break
cut at any minute. The cruiser was or
dered to the scene of the expected trou
bles and Captain Reiter lost no time in
Setting her there. In a f~w days the
cruiser may go to th<? Navy Yard or she
may be sont to Panama, as a warship is
wanted there o:i account of the lighting
now going on in Colombia.
As Koon as the Philadelphia came to an
anchor the French tri-color was run up
to the fore and a national ealute of twen
ty-one Runs fired. The ech*> of the last
gun had barely died away before Old
<jlory was Hying from the fore of the
French cruiser Prou-t and the national
F-i'.ute fired again. The mail for the Phil
adelphia was tent aboard at 3 a. m.. but
it will not be known until to-day what
will be done with the cruiser.
"Wharf Rats at Work.
The gang of snrak thieves that infests j
the water front got their work in on some j
valuable cargo lying on Union-street
wharf Thursday night. The stuff had
been discharged out of the British ship
Marechai Suchet and among It was a
case of ohinaware. The wharf rats se
cured a boat, and three of them rowed up
to Union-street wharf. Two of them got
up on the wharf and broke open the case
of chlnaware. They had unloaded nearly
half, of It into their boat when Officer
James McGowan caught sight of them, j
lie df scribes them as three boys, ranging |
In ege from 15 to IS years. They paid no i
attention to his order, but began, to row
for dear life. McGowan drew his gun and
fired two shots, but they escaped under
the wharf. The polio-man Jumped quick
ly in'O a Whitehall and gave chase. The
wharf rats were too much for him, how
ever, and made their escape among the
piles along the seawall.
"Water Front Notes.
The schooner Fortuna finished a splen
did run of twenty-four hours from Eu
reka yesterday. She and the steamer
North Fork started together and the
FTcamer only beat the- wir.d-jammer into
port by three hours. The reason for the ]
last run was a northwest wind blowing
sixty miles an hour.
The steamer Nome City had a very suc
cessful trial trip Thursday and will sail
for Nome, via Portland, to-day. She will
take only twelve passengers from here,
but 418 await her on the Columbia River.
Thf- Nome City will run hereafter be
tween Portland and the cold fields.
A fireman on the eteamer Newport,
ramed Chapman, was perhaps fatally
hurt on board yesterday. He was under
the Influence of liquor and stumbling over
a rope Ml. striking the. back of. his head
c.n th? hatch combing. He was hurried to
the Harbor Hospital, where Drs. Thorne
end Starr attended him. "
Th*> revenue cutter McCulloch Is getting
rea<1y for a cruise in Alaskan waters. She
Is now coating and her officers expect to
get away in a few days.

A Pile Cure That Goes to the Root of
the Disease
There are lots of lotions, oils and salves
that will, through their soothing Influ-
ence, relieve temporarily the pain Incident
to piles. But is that all the sufferer re-
quires? Isn't It a horrible thought to
realize that the ease la only temporary,
and that the disease goes on under the
surface without a moment's Interruption?
Wouldn't it be wiser to select a remedy
that seeks the source and regulates those
deep-seated disorders which Induce the
disease? Pyramid Pile Cure not only re-
lieves the pain at once, but effects a per-
manent cure of the worst form of piles.
You don't have to so through a tedious
course of dieting while using It either.
It etrlkes through those delicate- mem-
branes and tissues and sets the blood in
healthful circulation, reducing at once the
painful Inflammation and congested tu-
mors.
This remedy Is not a haphazard com-
bination of drugs, but It Is a remedy In-
vented by specialists who have treated
piles and blood disorders successfully for
years. Almost any flrst-class druggist
has It on sale at 50 cents per packnge.
Don't treat this disease with every lotion
and salve that comes along. Remember
the parts affected are among the most
delicate In the human body. This remedy
Is absolutely safe and no one need fear
to apply It freely on the most Inflamed
parts. The speed with which It allays the
pain Is an agreeable surprise to the suf-
ferer.

Through Minister Bwenson, the Danish

other power unless a substantial offer is

that, notwithstanding the criticism which

that negotiations wÂ«'re in progress, the

do not intend to do so unless they obtain

First Measure of Its Kind Passed by
the House Since the Civil
WASHINGTON, May 18.-For the first
time since the rebellion the House to-day
parsed a measure to pay Confederate sol
diers for losses growing out of the Civil
War. It was a bill Introduced by Cox of
Tennessee to pay the Confederate soldiers
who surrendered at Appomattox for the
loss of horses and other personal effects
taken from them In violation of Lee's ca
pitulation to Grant, by which the officers
and men of Lee's army were allowed to
retain their baggage and side arms and
hor?es. The bill originally carried $200.
000. but the specific sum was stricken out
and the appropriation was made indefin
ite The bill was passed out of Its order
as a special compliment to Cox, who, after
ten years' service In the House, is to re
tire at the end of his present term. Many
other claim bills were passed.

Jn? NOTHER Francisco girl ,
fL\ with musical and histrionic tal-
Jl ents has entered successfully
the difficult pathway that leads ,
to renown in the vaudeville field. The
young lady is Miss Marion Tracie, the
daughter of the famous editor of the
Louisville Courier Journal, predecess
or of the famous 'Henry Watterson.
She possesses exceptional abilities of
a varied character, including three
singing voices and the gift of story
telling with all dialects and their ac
cents.
Miss Trade was "tried- out" some
time ago by John Morrisey, manager
of the Orpheum, who took a particular
fancy to her work and predicted a
bright future for the young woman
on the Vaudeville stage. He called at
tention to the fact that there was sel
dom found a woman who could tell a
story well and that Miss Trade was
the exception. As a result of her dis
play of talent at the Orpheum the
youn^ woman has gone to Dawson un
der contract for four months at the
jolly figure of $100 per night.
Miss Tracie's many friends will hear
of her good fortune with genuine
pleasure. She will return to this city
in the fall and doubtless devote her
time to high-class vaudeville. She has
a charming personality and ought to
succeed.
REFORMERS
IN SAN JOSE
CONFIDENT
Monday.
Figure That Edwards Will
Have Votes to Spare
to Herd in Doubtful
Sea Forces Will Not Yield Easily and
Are Working Day and Night '
Special Dispatch to Ths Call.
SAN JOSE, May 18.â Interest in the city
election is Increasing, and the acquisition
to the Edwards forces during the past
few days indicate an overwhelming vic
tory for the Citizens' ticket. Systematic
work of the Committee of One Hundred
has .caused hundreds of voters to Join the
reform movement, while no increase can
be figured but in the kraals of Rea and
Mackenzie. Of course the gang is boast
ing of i ho large majorities Martin and the
rest of the ticket will get, but this blus
ter and braggadocio is the usual thing
with the Reaites, who hope by these
means to keep the timid business men
who receive some support from the city in
line
Unless all signs fail Edwards should
win by at least 400 majority. This is ac
counted for thus: In the charter fight
two years ago Martin only defeated
Smith, the Charter dub nominee, by 463
votes. Edwards will get the Smith vote
almost in toto, and added to this will
be the Good Government Club support,
the indorsement of the Pastors' Union
and churches and the Jacksonian Democ
racy, a reform Democratic club. Not only
this, but the Martin administration has
made many enemies. About the Mayor's
first act was to forget his obligations to
Tom Hogan the First Ward politician.
The First Ward has always been *v
stronghold of the Democrats and Martin,
but this ward will give Edwards a ma
jority. The Second and Third wards arc
counted on as sure-things by the Edwards
people. Gang politics will carry in the
Fourth "Ward, but this Is the only certain
ground the gangsters have.
The City Attorney-ship Is being promis
cuously traded by the gang to catch
votes. City Attorney Beasley is to be
turned down if Martin is re-elected. This
place has been promised to W. B. Hardy,
a former District Attorney, and also to
John E. Richards, the lawyer-Journalist.
Beasiey's decisions have displeased tho
administration. On more than one occa
sion he has checked ruthless expenditures
of city cash, and when he refused to sanc
tion a dip into the cash basis fund, which
is accumulating to meet the city's 'ndebt
edness, tho gang foreswore his end. The
Beasley following will evidently res.ent
this prejudgment, and as his following is
strcng the clever young attorney may yet
have the lauga on the administration.
Another lighting force against the pres
ent administration is the Colombetites.
When City Treasurer Ewing's death oc
cuned Mayor Martin named Joseph Co
lombet as his successor. There was a
universal indorsement of this act, but
Martin listened to Rea and Mackenzie
and when the Council objected he with
drew Colombet's name and nominated T.
J. McGeohegan.
Edwards, on the other hand, has no real
enemies. His business associations have
been such that merchants and citizens
generally Indorse him.
The two remaining days of the cam
paign will be lively ones. Monday's vote
promises to be a heavy one. The organi
zation of the Citizens' movement is per
fect, and. as the ticket Is a good one, it is
believed the voters will bury Reaism and
Mackenzielsm under an avalanche of bal
lotn. Victory this time means the com
plete annihilation of the gang and will be
the fitting climax to the defeat adminis
tered at the last county election.
A noteworthy phase of the campaign is
the fact that the city's future is being
carefully weighed by the voters. San Jose
has reached a critical point in its exist
ence. Partisan politics have kept the city
from receiving its full measure of great
ness. With the great and fruitful valley
surrounding it, t^e time has come when
San Jose must expand., electric roads to
various points must be constructed, out-
Blde capital and homeseekers must be at
tracted. The gang domination of city
affairs has prevented this enlargement.
Expensive administration of government
and the way all kinds of Â¦enterprises and
franchises have been held up In Council
and Supervisors have worked against the
city A majority of the voters are consid
ering these things, and the progressive
platform of the Citizens' party is looked
upon as the keynote to this new order.
The Citizens' ticket In full Is: Mayor,
H. J. Edwards; Clerk, W. J. Dougherty;
Treasurer. William Fischer; Councilmenâ
Second Ward, Byron Millard; Third
Ward, Tobe Lord.

knew her, from Victoria, Mendelssohn,
Sonntag, Schumann, Andersen. Thorwald
sen. G. W. Curtis, down to P. T. Barnum.
As a child of 3 she -imitated upon the
, piano the fanfare of the street buglers;
and through her girlhood Â¦ the super
abundance of music in her found expres
sion in- every step and bound that her
restless feet made. Until 9 years old she
had no more appreciative audience than
her blue-ribboned cat, to which she sang
by the hour till the wonder of her childish
voice attracted the attention of an actress
boarding in the neighborhood. Jennie
Lind's mother; a governess, embittered by
her hard struggles to support husband
and children, was with difficulty persuad
ed by this actress to subordinate her bur
gher prejudices to the future of the child
and consent to having the little girl's
voice tested at the Royal Theater. Jenny
Llnd describes herself at that time as "a
small, ugly, broad-nosed, shy, gauche, un
dergrown girl; yet the rare promise in her
voice cast ner awkwardness so entirely In
the background that the head of the the
ater agreed to take the 9-year-old girl and
educate her at the Government expense
for the next ten years.
The "actress-pupil Lind" found this
theatrical training always valuable to her.
Her position, however, was by no means a
sinecure, and her efforts to make restitu
tion for the drill and expense bestowed
upon her would have broken down a less
rugged constitution. At 10 she played the
part of Angela in "The Polish Mine"; at
13 she appeared In twenty-two perform
ances; but not until she was 17. after hav
ing appeared on the stage 111 times for
her board and clothes, did the directors
decide to allow her a small salary for her
services.
That year she played ninety-two times
In twelve new characters, chief among
which was Agatha in Weber's "Der Frei
schutz." In this she practically made her
debut and awoke to the knowledge of the
great dramatic gift which God had in
trusted to her. This date. March 7, she
celebrated each year thereafter as a sec
ond birthday. In a somewhat different
wording than that employed by Byron
she expressed the same Idea of a famous
awaking: "I got up that morning one
â¢ creature; I went to bed another creature
; I had found my power." Soon afterward
she was made a member of the* Royal
; Swedish Academy of Music and received
; the appointment of court singer. Within
! a few years she earned enough money
from provincial tours to enable her to go
to Paris for the study of technique.
,Her career thenceforth was a wonderful
exposition of Disraeli's theory that pa
tience is the necessary Ingredient of gen
ius. Once before, as- a child of 14, her
voice threatened for some time to leave
her, and had she not patiently striven at
these critical times to recover it It Is
probable that her genius might qulcklv
have degenerated into mediocrity. Her
voice was < not naturally flexible, yet by
means of her inexhaustible perseverance
she became enabled so skillfully to blend
the various registers that the most criti
cal ear failed to discover their "points of
junction." By practice, too, she attained
the power of rapid execution, not as nat
ural to trer as the richer sustaining power
of her notes. She would practice alone for
hours on the correct enunciation of some
words difficult to pronounce on a- high note
without the grimacing she detested; and
by practice she also learned to refill her
lungs with such â¢ dexterity that the re
newal of her breath was impossible of de
tection. She took the greatest care of her
voice, never dancing or drinking wine,
tea or coffee. Her conscientiousness was
due to her feeling each morning that her
voice was a gift 'from God, and that per
haps that very day might be the last of
its use.
After having mastered the details of
technique so that she might give her dra
matic and spiritual nature full play un
hampered by the mechanics of art. Jenny'
Lind returned to Stockholm. Here she
astounded even her most enthusiastic
friends by her enormous development in
singing, a development which made her
voice unique In the world.
Her progress in music thenceforth was
a series of triumphal ovations in Berlin,
Finland. Copenhagen, Leipzig, Munich.
Vienna. London and Americaâ the joy. of
each nationality In being awakened mu
sically to consciousness of itself finding
expression in many curious, and charac
teristic ways. Students serenaded her in
Copenhagen and Berlin, the art lovers of
Vienna fashioned silver wreaths, for her,
and the crowned heads of Europe present
ed her with gifts estimated to be worth
$.i00.000. . The names of "the Swedish
Nightingale" and "the divine Jenny" were
popular , efforts to express appreciation of
the birdlike, God-given qualities of her
voice.
Her course through Europe could easily,
be traced by the chain of charities which
she left In her wake.' These charities con
sisted not only In gratuitous concerts. In
singing in private to the sick or needy. In
surprising homesick Hans Christian An
dersen with a Christmas tree on Sylves
ter evening, but In giving wherever she
tarried thousands of dollars to the poor
and needyâ giving it gleefully, like a child.
The only allusion 'she was ever known to
thoroughly reciprocated this appreciation,
so much so that soon after her marriage
she made that country her home.
Jenny LJnd's American tour under the
management of P. T.'Barnum was an un
equivocal success. Although undertaking
this venture with some trepidation Jenny
LJnd felt that. she did not dare to miss
such a golden opportunity of doing: good.
She writes thus to a friend:
"I have for long bad the most eager
wish to earn, somewhere, a great deal oC
, money bo as to endow a school for poor
lost children In my own country, and the
invitation to America came as a direct
answer: so that I go there in this contt
dence and I pray God in heaven out of a
full heart that he will guide me thither
as ever before with his gentle hand and
will graciously forgive me in my sins and
my innrmitles. I shall have much to en
counter; it is a very arduous undertaking.
But since I have no less an aim before me
than to help in widening God's kingdom
the littlenesses of Ufa vanish In face of
this."
As a proof of this sincerity in spirit she
sent for the Mayor of New York the night
of her first concert In America and divided
the proceeds, nearly $10,000, according to
his advice among the charities of the city.
This precedent she followed throughout
her trip, giving the entire amount re
ceived from her American tour, more than
Â£40,000, among charities.
This tour brought her a great sorrow
and a greatjoy. Her mother's death sad
dened Jennys kind's visit to America.
While in Boston the prima donna, then
In her thirty-first year, was married to
Otto Goldschmidt, an accomplished young
musician, who had accompanied her at
several of her concerts. The marriaga
proved a most happy one and upon their
return 'they founded a home In England.
Here Mme. Goldschmidt led the busiest,
happiest kind of a life, for she said she
had found "all that her heart ever want
ed or loved." Before settling in Kngland
the young wife sang to delighted audi
ences in Holland, Austria. Ireland and
Germany. She sang thereafter only on
special occasions, generally for charity
sometimes in oratorio, sometimes in 'the
opera of "Ruth." composed by her hus
band, and sometimes in concert with -Mme
Schumann or alone.
To the last she retained the fire and
charm of that resistless voice, which was
a combination of the special qualities of
several prima donnas. One surprising fea
ture to her audiences was her ability,
upon attaining an unusually high note (to
reach which her hearers, through the
habit of mind induced by listening to
other great singers, would suppose her to
have expended all her strength) to carol
away with the oase". the Insouciance of a
bird. She possessed, too, an original
wonderful reserve power In her voice,
which enabled her carefully to avoid any
temptation to mere stagp vocalism and
with a tine reticence to hold her power
well in hand until she reached the. well
planned climax, which invariably swept
her audience out of Itself into the en
chanted realm where she reigned su
preme. Besides her originality she had a
dramatic force, based upon the study of
the art of Rachel, which would have won
her distinction, even If she had not beÂ«u
a prima donna. . To these gifts she added
fire, sympathy, an Intellectual grasp or
her subject and sincerityâ a combination
of the gifts of several artistic tempera
ments.
And yet. so all tter contemporaries de
clare.,the magic of cer voice was as noth
ing to the personality of the woman. So
keen was her Intellectual grasp of tho
topics, the problems of the day. ao nobla
yet so kindly withal was her conception
of II fo and it3 duties, that those who wero
uplifted by the charm of her voice de
clared, like the mother of Dean Stanley,
that they "would rather hear Jenny talJc
than sing." Back of all charm lay thÂ«Â»
goodness of the womanâ a simple-hearted
goodness which leveled all class distinc
tions, which converted the skeptic and
strengthened the believingâ the perfect
flowing of a deeply practical, religlocj na
turo upon which bad been grafted the
marvelous gift of music. Because Chris
tianity was ihe master spring of her life
her message was optimistic, and therefore
helpful. She said that she was vlad from
morning till night, as who would not be,
instructed with the guardianship of so
great a gift?
Surrounded by her happy- children and
grandchildren, she died as beautifully as
Bhe had lived. Stretching out her hajirts
to the sunlight coming in through the
shutters which her daughter had lust
opened, there bnrst from her lips the first
notes of her favorite. "An den Sonnen
schein." and so singing, there passed Into
the eternal sunshine Jenny LJnd. one of
tho most helpful geniuses that the world
has ever known..

Out of this mixed condition of affairs
have grown several lawsuits and other
trouble?.
The attorneys for the children In Paris
and Mrs. Osborne learned that- the other
contestants and lawyers for the estate
had compromised with Lang on a basis
of $300, and that Mr?. Osborne. the Paris
heirs and even the undertakers had been
left out in the cold. In order to prevent
the court from being imposed upon the
attorneys for Mrs. Oeborne and the for
eign heirs have called the matter to the
attention of Judge Coffey and asked for
a citation to compel those in the com
promise to show exactly the nature of
the transaction.
A peculiar complication In the matter of
the estate of the late attorney, P. C.
Trusseau. will be passed upon soon by
Probate Judge CoSey. Trusseau's second
wife died before her husband. Prior to
her death she had an estate of over $20,000
in realty. After her death her son, Ernest
Lar.g. exhibited deeds of gift from her
and. declared his mother left no estate.
This was disputed by R. W. King, who
took out letters of administration on the
estate, claiming the deeds were irregular.
If his position was correct this made her
estate a part of the estate of Trusseau.
By the will of Trusseau Mrs. Anna Os

THE LIFE STORY OF JENNY LIND.
BT CHARLOTTE BREWSTER JORDAN.
XIV. JENNY LIND-GOLDSCHMIBT
(1S21-1887.)
Through Jenny Llnd I first became sensible
of the hollnesa of art.', Thrpugh her. I learned
that one must forget 6ne'Â« self in the service
of the Supreme. No books, no men. have hail
a more ennobling: influence upon me. as % poet,
then Jenny L,lnd.â Hans Christian Andersen.
Great musicians, singers and players j
labor under heavier disadvantages in con
vincing posterity of their right to fame
than do the other children of genius; the
portable nature of their profession. Its un
recordablllty except In the memories of
their hearers, make succeeding generations
inclined to attribute their reputation to
the extravagance or the susceptibility of
their contemporaries. Jenny I.lnd would
have shared this general fate were
it not that her remarkable person
ality made such an Indelible impres
sion upon the people of all classes
In Europe and Americaâ upon the
tone-deaf, like Dean Stanley, as well as '
upon musicians like Meyerbeerâ that these !
impressions have been recorded in the
memoirs of every noteworthy person who 1
make to her wonderful talent was in Co
penhagen, after singing for a Home for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.
\Vhen she heard the unusually laige
amount which her concert had raised in r
eyes filled with tears, and she said to
Hans Christian Andersen: "Isn't It beau
tiful that I can sing so!"
Despite the undoubted success of her
operatic career she longed constantly for
a homely life â so much so that she decided
to abandon the stage in lsio. just eleven,
years from that memorable March 7. tho
birthday of her genius. This decision *ha
never regretted. She sung thereafter in
concert or poured out her soul in ora
torio. Mendelssohn, -who considered her
tho greatest artist hÂ© had known, wrota
the "Elijah" for the peculiar beauty of
her voice and in that she was at her best,
for she said Jt lifted her up Into another
world.
Her retirement from the stag** did not
spring from a puritanical aversion to it.
She did not think It immoral or she would
not have gone to see others act nor would
?he have founded a school for the educa
tion of stage aspirants. It was simply
because, having- passed unspotted throusrh,
the evils of stage environment, she f*>lt
worn by the artificialities and difficulties
of her progress and longed for the home
liness of home.
In England she> was greatly beloved and

A minister gives his experience with
cotTee drinking and its effect on his
health, but requests that if his name be
u^ed his residence be omitted and only
furnished in reply to inquiries that may
be addressed to the Postum Cereal Co..
Ltd.. at Battle Creek, Mich.
He says he had catarrh of the stom-
ach and dyspepsia, caused by drinkins:
coffee. By advice of the physician he
left off coffee for a few years and drank
hot water. "In visiting one . of the
homes of my congregation about a year
znd a half ago I was introduced to
Postum Food Coffee, the ladv of the
house saying that tea and coffee had
very badly affected a daughter and that
Mr.ce she had quit them both and used
Po c ium Food Coffee she was very much
improved in health.
"I tried a cup of it and found no bad
effects following. On my return home
I got a package and enjoyed its use
very much better than either tea or cof-
I fee. it having none of the harsh taste
of those beverages. I took 'to usinz
Pobturn both morning andynight and
found it bcr.efiied me in a most marked
way.
"Our children enjoy it and keep
healthy and. well. My' wife and -the ser-
vant have both stopped the use of coffee
and enjoy Postum better than the for-
mer. As you will observe, the entire
family have been improved in health
by making the chanpe." The minister's
name is Rev. David T. Robertson.
Postum Food Coffee has a well de-
fined work in rebuilding the nervous
system that has been broken down bv
the use of coffee. This is particularly
noticeable in highly organized individ-
uals. The Postum is made from pure
grains, and selected part* that contain
phosphat*". of potash, are used.
The delicate particles thus obtained
from nature are known by chemists to
wn-te with the albumen of food, from
which the gray matter that fills the brain
snd nerve centers is made. There is a
â¢rue and scientific reason why Postum
Food Coffee strengthens the user, both
A'nentally and physically, and these facts
< an be proven in any case where a trial
of ten days or two weeks will be given.Foreign Futures.

NEW YORK, May 18.â Bradstreefs to-mor
row will 6ay: Continued dullness In many
branches and a further shading In several
staple lines constitute the leading features in
the business^ situation this week. The weak
ness of prices is displayed in lower quotations
for corn, pork, butter, cheese, wool and cot
ton, among the great agricultural : products,
and petroleum and lead among mineral pro
ducts. Wheat Is slightly higher, partly owing
to leÂ«s favorable crop reports here and abroad.
Continued drynef|Â» In the Northwest has given
the spring wheat situation a less satisfactory
appearance and there is little Improvement
noted In the winter wheat sections of the Cen
tral West. It Is doubtful, howeVer. if the dry
weather has yet really affected spring wheat,
chief complaint coming from the lumber In
terest, which reports low ; streams Interfering
with the forwarding of supplies. Wool has
been shaded again, notwithstanding the fact
that rather more strength is noted In London
sale prices, where oupplles of desirable grades
are reported not excessive. The Iron and steel
situation is no stronger and shaded prices fail
to develop much new business. Bessemar pig
Is nominally unchanged at Pittsburg, but tho
same grade of Iron made outside of that city
Is being offered there below current quotations.
Structural material continues the - strongest
feature of the trade. : From Birmingham come
reporta of continued large export' business. 1
more having been done In two weeks past than
In two weeks previously. ' but -quotations are
largely nominal and the outlook Is rather more
uncertain. A - number of large Pennsylvania
mills have shut- down. for repairs much earlier
than usual and some relief from this source la
looked for. Among other metals lead Is very
weak and current prices are the loweit for a
long time â¢ past. Tin has also - been shaded
while copper Is ' nominally unchanged. The
Industrial sltuatlcn : Is â¢ on the whole rather
better than for some time j past, in that new
disturbances are fewer and some old ones have
been Btttle4.',<But practical tie-ups at Chicago
are still unbroken. At St. = Louis all kinds of
bUBlners has been hurt by the strike of street
railway employes and uncertainty at other
cities, particularly In the building trades, has
had an unsettling effect upon lumber. ,

NEW YORK. May 19.â Bradstreet' s Financial
Review to-morrow will say: Narrow and -Ir
regular speculation has again been the notable
feature of the stock market this week. Pro
fessional Interests of the smaller kind seem to
have been responsible for most of the fluctua
tions exhibited by prices. The continuance of
gold shipments and the transfer of over $3,000,
000 in specie from New York to Paris were,
however, disregarded, and of the influences of
a general character which were effectual fac
tors, a leading place must be assigned to the
growing ease of money here and abroad. Call
loans at New York have been quoted all week
In the neighborhood of 2 per cent and there
is every prospect of the permanency of such
conditions. This makes It easier to carry
stocks and at the same time leads to a cer
tain amount of Investment buying of dividend
paying railroad shares and other securities in
which the public has confidence. There was
no very heavy buying of American rails for
London account, but the financial conditions
abroad just referred to, with the supposed
prospect of an early end to the South African
war. resulted Â¦ in a cheerful tone in London,
which had an effect on our own market. The
continuance of good railroad earnings and
favorable crop news were also influences in
speculation and the granger and Southwestern
railroad shares showed at times a very fair
amount of strength. On the other hand the
industrials as a rule have again been weak.
At lower prices the leading steel etocks seemed
to find renewed support, mainly . from the
covering of short contracts, although some re
newed buying of a better character was re
ported to be In progress. . This checked the
disorganization in the group In question, but
another part of the industrial list then became
very weak. This was the tobacco stocks,
American and Continental. The. former es
pecially fell rapidly and severely on the con
tinuance cf the reports that a powerful op
position concern Is to be established with the
backing of capitalists who recently left the
management of the American Company. It
might be noted, however, that this decline of
American Tobacco at)d the Indications of re
newed weakness in sugar refining stock did
not have any great Influence on' the railroad
list, which continued steady to strong and
seemed, in fact, more Inclined to cut loose
entirely from the Industrials.

NEW YORK. May 18.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
There was no public business in the markets
here to-day and prices sagged on profit-taking
by professionals. Funds were weak on the
news that Russia had seized Masempho, in
Korea. New York sold Tlntos and Paris at
first absorbed offerings, but subsequently there
ot.s a relapse, the news from Korea being
taken more seriously in France than in Eng
land. The double option was offered at 40.
Paris also sold Anacondas while London Is
overbought. Americans were dull, there being
no London market for them and the tendency
was toward reaction, support being trifling-
The Bank of England lost Â£62.000 in gold to
the Cape. Money was easy, mainly, however,
because of the Idleness of this market. Silver
was sold at 27Hd per ounce on Russian and
Indian orders. . . ,

weekly review of trade to-morrow will say:
-Business Is not what it was a year ago. but
men' do not agree in defining the difference.
The working force, then 1 increasing fast, is
now, decreasing. Works are stopping to relieve
excessive output in manufactures of paper, cot
ton, wool, leather and some forms of steel,
while prices are suddenly reduced for the same
purpose In lead, wire and nails. What seems
to some "merely spring dullness" others think
the "beginning of reaction."
The remedy for one difficulty does not fit
the other and there is more need than usual
for close attention to the meaning of events.
In place of the wild speculation In securities,
which swelled exchanges a year ago, there nan
come such liquidation that twenty preferred
Industrial stocks have sold this week at priced
averaging Â£83 11 per share, though the same
Â¦etocks Bold in April last year for J93 66 per
share, and twenty common have sold this weelc
for $38 49. which sold last year at $76 99. double
the price. Yet many of these companies have
earned and paid good dividends and all have
enjoyed a year of extraordinary business. The
industrials have reached the lowest average
they have ever known, while the sixty most
active railway stocks, though depressed about
*4 per Bhare since early in April are higher
now than In January or February, higher than
early In December and higher than a year ago.
Business in some lines has been hindered by
the holding of prices so high as to check con
sumption. The closing of works by the steel
and wire company, followed by the reduction
of J20 per ton In prices of its ' products; the
closing of many paper mills because of over
production; the sudden reduction of 70c per 100
pounds In lead from the price to which It was
raised late in December; the report that tin
plate works may be closed a while for similar
reasons, create a leeltng that some business
has no longer the guarding and guiding influ
ences of prices answering quickly to the de
mand for consumption. But progress toward a
healthy adjustment has been rapid within the
past week.
Transactions at Pittsburg in Bessemer
seem to be largely at "guaranteed prices," so
that definite quotations are avoided, though
much Bessemer from the East is offered at
very low figures. Gray forge is a shade lower
there,- and local coke at Chicago, while No. 1
Lehlgh Is quoted lit $21 50 here. Bars at Phila
delphia are Jl 75. 'while the Pittsburg associa
tion reaffirms its quotation of 2c. which Is
shaded. Plates also sell there at Jl 07, with
$1 73 quoted at Philadelphia. The demand for
structural and other products has been much
reduced In part by building strikes. .
Woolen manufacturers are not meeting a
very satisfactory market at the advanced prices
asked, and until a change appears in that re
spect the holders of wool will need patience.
The movement of grain continues large, corn
still rivaling wheat In quantity exported. At
lantic exports of wheat in three weeks of May
have been, flour included, 8,232,041 bushels,
against 7.016.540 last year, and Paciflc ex
ports 2.203,909. against 1.367.906 bushels last
year, while exports of corn In the same weeks
have been 10,382,95? bushels, against 6.914.536
bushels last year. Wheat has advanced over a
cent.
Failures for the week have been 117 In the
United States against 147 last year, and 30 in
Canada, against 17 last year.

Fannie Ward has captured "Diamond Joe" Lewis, the South African diamond
dealer, rival in generosity and ostentation to the lato Barney Barnato.
Miss Wardâ or rather Mrs. "Diamond Joe" Lewisâ will bo ivmf>mnpr.-'d as the
oripinil Cupid in Dave Henderson's "Sinbad." She waf= full of vim ar.d bounce
in thoFe days, little mure than a childâ in yearsâ and with h's. blue eye* and
a wealth of hair. She was the particular and dearest friend (if Nina Karrinp:
ton. and with th<* Fame vivid prospects In store. It was she that wound up the
first dance of young "Duke" Brown, son of the commodore of the New York
Yacht Dub.
Mlsa Ward astonished New York one morning by suing voting Brown for
hrpaoh of promise. The case, however, never came to trial, for the commodore
is paid to have settled by a cash payment. It was determined on that occasion
that Miss Ward had oloped with the youth, but 1hat ?he had left him when his
father cut off his allowance..
"Diamond Joe" L/wls started with 0. and since then has managed to add
seven other figures to It. His wealth to-day Is said to be in the neighborhood' of
SS5,<XX>J000, hut he frankly confesses that he never counted up and doesn't know
himself. His attentions to Miss Ward began by starring her In "Lord and Lady
Al^y." In which she made a hit and some morfey. Mrs. Ward, who is known to
her dear friends as "Mamma," has accompanied her daughter through her suc
cesfes; and is said to have arranged the match with "Diamond Joe" in a very
able manner.
Mrs. "Diamond Joe" says she expects to make her ncme in England, but that
she may visit America again.

Alameda County Fruit Grow
ers Enthusiastic Over
Organization.
Eidiculously Low Price Offered by
Canners for Cherries Arouses Those
Engaged in the Industry in
Alameda County.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
HIS Broadway, May IS.
The fruit growers of San t.eandro are
very much determined in regard to the
organization of a growers* association at
the general meeting called for Saturday
nlght. The fact that a few offers for
cherries have been made and that these
offers have confirmed the worst fears of
the growers has stimulated interest in the
proposed organization.
The cause cf this move was the grow
ing tear that the canneries would force
prices down, and when a few offers did
come and were at the rate of 2Vfc cents a
pound the growers decided that their
cause was a just one and that they would
have to organize to save themselves. The
final Bteps in the organization will be
taken at Saturday's meeting. Everybody
from Elrnhurst to Haywards has been in
vited to attend. All of the large growers
have said that they would be present.
It is claimed by the growers that the
price offered for the fruit will not pay
the expense of picking, hoxlng'nnd ship
ping, and will leave no profit on the fruit.
Some have gone so far as to say that they
will leave their fruit on the trees rather
than pick it at the price offered.
No matter what may be. the action of
the fruit men, they are certainly at the
mercy of the cannery combination until
they have completed a counter-organiza
tion. The growers appreciate this, and
that Is what is 'causing the interest In
Saturday's mf eting.
The organization can do but little more
this year than, act as a Dureau of infor
mation. It is expected that it will do
hardly more than keep the members in
formed as to prices and the action of the
canneries, but by the npxt fruit season It
Is expected that the growtrs* combination
will have been perfected to such an extent
that an effort to control the output can
be made with some success. The growers
of San Leandro and the neighborhood are
determined that they will meet combina
tion with combination and that they will
not pick cherries at 2\? cents a pound.

no trace of Sherratt.
Some of the officers of the order have

Dr. J. G. Jessup, one of the prominent
members, said that while charges will un
doubtedly be preferred atTainst Sherratt
to-morrow evening he could not give any
information, as the order was secret and
its business not-public. He said, however,
that the secretary bad been given a small

Of the Bible Into Filipino Dialect Cir-
A r.fw method of circulating: the Bible

Â»ndÂ« is proj^-ctci by the American BiMe
Society. Instead of depending on mission
*rifs from the United States, a native
laÂ«ralrp and a native Pangaslnan are to
be employed tn Ro i n to the Interior of the
country. The Frrlptures are now in prog
ress of translation into the curious dia
lecte of the Inlanders. The Bible Society
if pushing the- work forward with all pos
sible rapidity. The work already under
taKen comprises the dialects of the TÂ«iga
los. PanjjaÂ«!nans and Viscayans. Scholars
are studying the other dialects. These
translator* will be the flm to make a
written language of many Filipino ver
naculars.
Another plan of work in the Philippines
which the society has in view Is a scheme
for distributing Bibles emon* the ships
that come into Manila harbor. This Idea
Is pupgrested by the plan already in eftect-
Ive operation In Port Said harbor
All this work in the Philippines Is un ler
the control of the secretaries of the Amer
ican Bible Society, whose office Is in New
York. They have Just received the fli.'t

WASHINGTON , May 18.â Soon after the
Senate convened to-day Morgan, chairman
of the Committee on Interoceanlc Canals,
offered a resolution directing an investi
gation sweeping in its character of the
dealings of individuals or j corporations
with a view to monopolizing a ship canal
at Panama or in Nicaragua, and whether
tho individuals or, corporations propose
to obstruct the United States in the con
struction of an isthmian canal. Morgan
stated that the object of the inquiry pro
posed was to enable the President' of the
United States to "check, escape from and
destroy a conspiracyâ founded In fraud
and corruption and arroganceâ against the
highest rights and privileges of the peo
ple and Government of the United States."
Tho resolution was referred.
Discussing the resolution, Morgan said
the old Panama Canal Company was
chartered under the laws' of France. A
syndicate four years ago purchased the
assets of the old company and reorganized
under tho name of the "New Panama
Canal Company." This syndicate had of
fered to permit the United States to share
in its work so far as it was able without
violating its concessions, which would
have to be scrupulously observed. This
proposition was made, he said, when it
was realized that the new Panama Canal
Company was approaching bankruptcy.
It could not be considered by the United
States, he said, without involving thÂ©
United States In serious trouble with
France, as the 5000 or more French share
holders in the old company would also
share in the new company, and the United
States could not, anyhow, identify itself
with a corporation organized, as had been
suggested, under the laws of New Jersey
or some other State.
Monopoly in Canal Charters.
"The proposition," declared Morgan, "is
so absurd that it would not receive a min
ute's consideration were it not that It Is
being pressed at every possible point and
at every possible moment of time,"
He invited attention to the charters of
the canal concessions companies organized
in New Jersey, saying Congress should
make a rigid investigation of the sub
ject and break down and check the great
est and most comprehensive monopoly
ever organized under the laws of New
Jersey. Morgan said he did not propose
to delay action upon the pending Nica
ragua canal bill , until this investigation
was concluded.
McCumber of North Dakota addressed
the Senate on the Philippine question. He
said it was to our commercial, financial
and naval interests to retain the lslajnds.
Having incidentally remarked that he
thought all the people of the Union were
happy now to be under one flag and in
one Government, Tillman of South Caro
lina interrupted McCumber and declared
that not 10 per cent â he might say that 5
per cent â of the white people of the South
were to-day glad that the Confederacy
had been defeated or what they fought
for had been rejected.
Butler of North Carolina Interrupted to
say that he could not corroborate the
statement of Tillman. A minute later,
when Caffery of Louisiana rose to make
an inquiry, Wolcott asked him if he
shared in the opinion that 95 per cent of
the Southern white people regretted now
that the reoelllon had failed and that the
Union remained undivided.
"I do not," replied Caffery.
Pneumatic Tube 1 Champions.
Mason of Illinois resumed his discussion
of the committee amendment providing
for tho extension of the pneumatic tube
service. He defended Milnolland against
insinuations. Chandler of New Hamp
shire declared this useful modern inven
tion should not be abandoned any more
than we should abandon electric lights or
telephones or . automobiles. Chandler
commented on the extraordinary delay of
the Postal Commission, of which Wolcott
is chairman, in not making a report,
which 'delay, he said, permitted the rail
roads to increase their vast receipts for
carrying the mails and at the same time
prevented an adequate understanding of
the merits of the pneumatic tube service.
He believed the railroads had much to do
with the difficulties Congress encountered
in dealing with these questions.
Hale protested against loading'down the
bill with a "mere fanciful scheme," which
had been advanced before Congress with
the most "brazen effrontery."
Carter of Montana said the difficulties
of the chairman of the i^ostofflce Commit
tee (Wolcott) with the members of the
committee did not reflect credit upon that
Senator. He had attacked private charac
ter with that immunity given those speak
ing in public debate, and instead of pre
senting facts had indulged in ponderous
declamation. Carter said that the exten
sion of the tube service would to some ex
tent add competition to the telegraph and
express companies, and this, the Senator
thought, might account for some of the
opposition to the system.
Lodge said the system had operated to
advantage in Boston, but he could not
vote for this loosely worded amendment
providing an extension committing the
Government to enormous expense.
Hoar suggested a; proviso that any ex
tension of the service be limited to S12.090
a mile.
Wolcott Makes Reply.
Wolcott said he would not be disturbed
by the Kros.sfy unjust and unfounded re
marks of the Senator from Montana (Car
ter) â¢ nor by the charge of the Senator
from New Hampshire (Chandler) that
the. railroad were behind the opposition.
The railroads had no more do with it
than they had with fixing the color of
stamps.
Mason offered an amendment providing
that In any extension of tho service the
rental shall not exceed 10 per cent of the
actual cost of construction and mainte
nance, plus the actual cost of operation
The matter went over without final ac
tion.
The bill to enlarge the powers of the
Department of Agriculture, prohibiting
the transportation by interstate commerce
of game killed in violation of local law,

' TO PANAMA COMPANY
Colombian Government Adds An
other Obstacle to American
Canal Construction. Â«
Special Dispatch, to The Call.
WASHINGTON, May IS.â Secretary Hay
has been advised by Minister Hart at
Bogota that the Colombian Government
has authorized an extension of the con
cession held by- the Panama Canal Com
pany. This extension was purchased by
the company for 5,000,000 francs and ex
tends over, a . period of six years. The
present concession will not expire until
1904, and a six years' extension will carry
until -1910;
Members of the Isthmian Canal Com
pany say that the canal, can be easily con
structed within ten years, even with the
present â¢ force at work on the waterway.
It is said, further, that it will cost less to
complete the Panama, canal than it will
to construct the Nicaragua waterway.
Tho company is naturally anxious that
the United States takdno action with re
spect to the Nicaragua canal, and every
month's delay, will be beneficial to it. It
Is expected that every obstacle will ' be
thrown in the way of the Senate when
the canal bill' comes up for consideration
during the next session. -

PASSENGERS FOR
NOME HAVE LOST
THEIR TICKETS
When the steamship Zealandia is ready
to weigh anchor on next Monday to sail
for Nome the police- will be on the lookout
to arrest the holders of a number of tick
ets that have been stolen from the orig
inal buyers. About 800 tickets have been
sold for the trip and the majority of them
have been In the hands of their purchas
ers for many weeks.
Many complaints have been made to the
agents of the steamship, that tickets have
been stolen and the agents have deter
mined to help the losers by apprehending
the thieves if possible. With that object
In view the purser will be instructed to
take up all tickets before the Zealandia
leaves the harbor. .He. will be furnished
with a list of the etoien tickets and the
men who present them will probably be
arrested. This will be a difficult tasK in
turn a large crowd, but special arrange
ments nave been made to facilitate the
work and it is believed that none of
thieves will escape.
It Is anticipated that in some instances
men who have lost their tickets have
lost them at the gambling table. Some of
the gold seekers have been in the city for
months getting ready for the trip, and it
is not unnatural that they should fall
victims to the crowd of bunko and sure
thing men who infest the city. Even in
these cases the police will likely interfere
and restore to the victims the valuables
they have lost. Again, it is likely that
many innocent people may suffer because
they have been induced to buy the stolen
tickets at greatly reduced rates.
Little sympathy Is wasted on the men
who lose their tickets and cash to bunko
men, but the police may be able (through
th<?m to locate some of the crooksiwho are
doing the business.

e^i C. BERGIN, a military prisoner
I \ from Alcatraz. made a break for
Ij \ liberty at the Presidio yesterday
and was shot dead by Sergeant
Martin of Troop G. Sixth Cavalry, who
was in charge of the guard. Another
prisoner who made the break with Ber
gin was wounded by one of the guards,
but succeeded in getting away.
Bergin. who was serving a five-year sen
tence on the "rock." was formerly a mem
ber of the Ninth Infantry, but was dls
honorably discharged at the time of his
sentence. He was what is known as a.
;econd-claw prisoner. "With nineteen oth

Z while the prisoners were eating their
unch It was evidently a preconcerted
iffalr. for the two prisoners took advan
age of the absence of two of the guards
alien they made their dash for freedom.
There were five sentries and two non
-ommissioned officers In the guard over
he twenty prisoners. One of the prison
ers was allowed to go to the rear and In j
iccordance with the rules governing pris- j
aners' guards two sentries and a non
â¢ommissionod officer went with him. This j
reduced the guard to three men with
Sergeant Martin. It was at that time that
Bergin and his companion started.
The prisoners were eating behind the
rear wing of the hospital building and the
two prisoners first turned the corner of
the building and then ran past the hos
pital, across the end of the old parade
ground and toward the trees that till
the canyon between the old parade ground
and the officers' quarters.
The guards are armed with repeating
shotguns loaded with buckshot and they
at once opened fire. They hit both men,
but neither was seriously wounded. The
sentries could not leave the other prison
ers. hoJivever, so Martin with his cavalry
carbine continued on nfter them. When
he reached the hospital guardhouse he
saw the men nearing the trees across the
parade ground.
"Halt!" he cried. "Halt, or I'll kill
you!"
No attention was paid to the command
and thp sergeant stopped suddenly, drew
a quirk siRht on Bergin and fired. The
man was struck almost in the middle of
the back. ; He threw un his hands and
plunged forward into the trees. At the
same time the other man disappeared.
Martin ran across the parade ground
after the second man and for a long time
he scoured the canyon in seach of him!
but the Reach was In vain. Bergin lay
lust inside the outer line of trees. He
had died instantly. The other m;m was

By a unanimous vote the San Francisco
Improvement Association put Itself on
record last night as being In favor of the
restriction of Japanese immigration.
There was no room for debate on the
matter, as the members of the association
Â¦who were present were all of one mind.
A. B. Truman offered the resolution and
made a brief speech, in which he declared
that the Japanese in this country, as a
class, constituted the greatest criminal
element in' It. Charles Alpers, In second
ing the resolution, denounced the Japan
ese from an economic point of view. The
resolution adopted by the association Is as
follows:
"Resolved, That this association places
itself on record as being opposed' to un
restricted immigration, and that the
proper authorities be requested to take
â¢active measures to suppress this immi
gration."
The association also took up the mat
ter of reduced streetcar fares and dis
cussed It at some length. The. question is
already partially In the hands of the
executive committee, but in order to brinfr
all of tho matters in tho Maguire or
dinance before tho executive committee
for thorough investigation, P. M. Mc-
Gushin offered the following: resolution:
"Resolved, That It is the sense of this
association that 2Va-cent streetcar fares
are detrimental to the growth of the city,
it meaning the abolition of the present
transfer system and the reduction of the
wages of streetcar employes.
Mr. McGushin stated that there is a
movement now on foot for the organiza
tion of streetcar employes to fight the
Maguire ordinance. â¢
The executive committee referred back
to the association the- proposition to levy
a tax on bicycles, with a recommendation
that the matter be dropped. After some
discussion the main body re-referred the
question to the executive committee, on
the ground that they had not heard the
arguments in favor of the proposed tax
from the men who first suggested the
thing. . Â¦
The question of a new site for the City
and County Hospital was sent back by the
executive committee without recommen
dation.. A. B. Truman spoke at some
length on the question suggesting that if
the building were removed at all it ought
to be placed in the warmest part of the
city. He thought that Bay District farm
was the proper place for It. Charles Al

A dispatch from Washington printed In
The Call yesterday announced that the
river and harbor bill had been passed
by the House. While this is interesting
In itself, there was a "rider" attpched
to the bill which is of more importance
to the people of middle California than
appeared -from the published matter. At
torney General Tirey L. Ford received a
dispatch from Congressman de Vries
stating that the bill had been passed and
that it contained the "debris resolution."
The history of this resolution is inter
esting. Some time ago the California Leg
islature appropriated $250,000 for the im
pounding of debris in the upper rivers
for the protection of miners and farm
ers. To this the Federal Government
added $250,000. .
The California Debris Commission, com
posed of government engineers, has work
ed for a long time to perfect a system
by which the desired work can be effec
tively accomplished. They finally report
ed to the War Department a system
which would cost $800,000 or $900,000 more
than the combined appropriations. They
declined to go ahead with the work until
the required money was in sight.
When Attorney General ford was In
Washington he was commissioned to In
terest the California delegation in the
matter and to get them to induce the
proper authorities to authorize the be
ginning of this important work without
waiting for an additional appropriation
by Congress. The California representa
tives went to work earnestly and the
"debris resolution" is the result. It is
an authorization on the War Department
to have the work begun. The deflciency
will be made up later. As soon as the
California Debris Commissioners receive
ofllcial notification of the action mention
ed the work will begin.

injured severely enough to prevent him
getting away.
That the men had been planning to es
cape is certain from the fact that the
man who got away answered in the
morning at rollcall to the name of Lux.
It was said afterward by one of the pris
oners that he was not Lux, but a man
who had taken Lux's place in order to
make the break with Berlin. There are
427 prisoners on the island and it is Im
possible for the guards to tell them
apart, particularly those who have but
recently come from Manila.
Colonel Rawles, commandant of the
Presidio, notified the Coroner's office of
the affair, at the same time saying that
the case was a purelv military one and
should be dealt with by the military au
thorities. The Coroner agreed with this
idea and so the body of Bergln was al
lowed .to remain in the post morgue. Noth
ing has been done'to Sergeant Martin, as
I lie acted entirely within the line of his
duty. In fact, it is taken as a serious
warning to any more prisoners who may
contemplate similar attempts.
Since the custom of bringing prisoners
over from Alcatraz to the , Presidio to i
work around the post has been inaugurat
ed there have been a great many escapes;
in fact, at one time they averaged one a
week. Sometimes shots would be fired
at the escaping prisoners and sometimes
the prisoner would slip off so quietly that
there was no chance for a shot. The pun
ishment for a sentry for allowing a pris
oner to escape is very severe if it can be
shown that the escape was due in any
way to his negligence. For that reason,
to have no excuse for negligence on ti.e
part of the guards, new rules were espe
cially made for their guidance. One para
graph of these orderg provides that there
shall be no more than ten prisoners In a
pquad and it was expected that when the
forty prisoners came over yesterday
morning they would . be divided up
into four squads. But they were divided
Into only two squads, and one of these
was sent to work on the general hospital
grounds. Sergeant Martin was placed in
charge of this squad, with Corporal Per
rln of Troop F, Sixth Cavalry, and Cor
poral Danielson of Company H, Twenty
second Infantry, to assist him. Corporal
Danielson is one of the garrison of the
Island. . .
It was a plain matter of duty with Ser
geant Martin, and he speaks quietly of
the affair as one only of duty. He is one
of the best shots In the service andÂ»has
worn the sharpshooters' badge more than
once, although he has been but three
years a soldier. His comrades and his
officers give him the best of characters,
and his rank as a sergeant after so short
a service speaks well for his record. The
shot he took at the fleeing prisoner was
made at nearly 200 yards. There was no
time to fix hig sights and no time for a
rest. It was after a run of 100 yards and
the sergeant was winded from his exer
tions, but he kept his head and caught
his man just in time.
â¢ But little sympathy Is expressed for the
man who was killed. Guarding prisoners
Is work none of the soldiers want, and be
sides the penalty of an escape falls heav
ily on them. The repeated escapes have
made prisoners' guard a much more seri
ous thing than It hau been and the men
are hoping that now the prisoners will- be
a little less willing to break.
Thp mfptir.g- of tho peneral committee
Jn charge of the eeiobratlon of Memorial,
day. last evening, was productive of a
good deal of business, but the business
transacted was not Its most interesting
feature. Among the communications re

delegates did not wish to raise a scandal,
and po the matter was laid on the table i
Â»nd a vote of confidence in Mr. Cahen was i
defeated on the ground that he did not )
Tiecd such a puaranty.
The ill-timfd letter was looked upon by]
ell as a mistakeâ as a petty crow from a '
man small <_ nough to see in the Grand I
Army and a Â£VX> appropriation food for i
a. political slay in the face. It was lucky '
Tor the Mayor that the committee wished !
to avoid a scandal. ;
The following programme of exercise*
to bÂ»- held In the National Cemetery In the !
JYeFidio was submitted by the programme i
committee and was adopted:
llueic by bend: introductory remark? by the j
president of the day; prayer by chaplain: pon^

On the committee's recommendat'on it I
w?s further derided that Jesse B. Fuller. I
si past department commander, be made I
president of tiu- day: that the prayer be j

LABOR COUNCIL
DECIDES TO USE
A SOFTER WORD
"Unfair" Will in Future
Replace the Harsher
"Boycott."
The San Francisco Labor Council has
decided to drop the word "boycott" from
its vocabulary and use the word "unfair"
instead. The latter word Is now used
when a business house or other concern
has been placed on the dbjectionable list,
as was done at last night's meeting, when
action was taken against the shoe house
of .G. M. Kutz & Co., the Popular Res
taurant on Geary street, Whelan Bros,
and the cloakmakers' combination, who
were guilty of locking out union hands
In preference to Japanese and white
"scab" workmen.
It was the declination of the firm of
Kutz it Co. to meet the Labor Council
delegates halfway on a compromise prop
osition that caused the firm to be placed
on the "unfair" list last night.
The Popular Restaurant erred In having
Its interior renovated by non-union work
men employed by J. C. Sellers, who also
got his. name on the "unfair" side of the
union ledger.
Complaint was made against the com
mittee having charge of the printing for
the Caledonian picnic. This body favored
a "scab" house to the exclusion of houses
having the right to use the Allied Printing
Trades union label. .A similar complaint
was made against the Arcade Club, which
society has engaged. a "scab" band of
music for Its picnic at Seaside Gardens
to-morrow.
The reports of the various delegates to
the Council are to the effect that encour
aging conditions exist In the union labor
market. __^_____^_^__
