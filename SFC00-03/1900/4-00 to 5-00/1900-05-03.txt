She represented herself as the wife of a
"merchant" who is. a member of the firm
Of Qucing Fat.& Co. at 717 Dupont street.
She presented her credentials, her wit
nesses swore to the truth of her asser
tions and Collector Jackson admitted her
to San Francisco. She is now a Chinese
slave In Baker alley. She Is the property
of the Chinese" "husband" who swore that
?he is. his wife.; If the Collector of the
Port or the United States Marshal cares
to do so. he may :flnd ;her at his conve

slave trade that in Us audacity is
perhaps with out parallel in the his
tory of the country and in its profits
to the members of the ring zvho arc
engaged in it is greater than any
other that czcr disgraced an admin

through the Custom HousÂ£^ t in

arc passing the barrier of Federal
laws as zvcll, to be sold after they
leave the vessels upon which they
arrive as so much convertible mer

that they have taken the work of
investigation altogether out of the
hands of tlw official inspectors and

interested in encouraging the impor

While this is being done the
agents of the Pacific Mail Steam

Damage Suit.
NEW YORK. May 2.â The answer to the
United States Government In the suit for
'$50,000 damages -against Commissioner of
Immigration Fitch'lc by Jorg Cruze. a
Porto Rlcan. who was detained here; as a
contract laborer on â¢ his arrival recently
from San Juan, was to-day served on the
plaintiff's counsel. This suit is brought
to determine the status of Porto Rico.
Tho Government's answer admits that.
"Porto-Rico was, relinquished and Its sov
ereignty .ceded to tho United States by
Spain." and then sets up the contention
that "it has no. knowledge or informa
tion pufflcient to form a belief that the
plaintiff was born |q the island of Porto
Rico and has always lived therein and
was a subject of Spain until the 11th day
of April. 1SP0. and therefore denied thÂ©
same." It is lastly denied that the plain
tiff was in any way damaged in the sum
of $3O,ono.- and the United States Circuit
Court isr asked to dismiss- the siiit on its,
merits and with costs to the plaintiff.'
Government Files Its Answer in the

the--gentleman- from Iowa with great re-:
sppct,- and- he ; himself had been assailed
without provocation. â¢ He would dismiss
the whole subject, Hepburn's violent re
marks were due to his temper and not his
calm -judgment.' Here the matter rested.
Gaines and Mann Clash.
Soon afterward' another Scene occurred
when Gaines of Tennessee took exception
to a personal, allusion ' made to blm: by
Mann of Illinois. After reading: from the
record Mann's statement, Gaines with
Kreat vehemence declared that the man
who had -uttered the words- was "devoid,
of common decency, courtesy and gen-'
titity." The Illinois member had told
him, Gaines taid.-that he had come from
the South and waa a Southern man and
i\4 thanked God that he was 1500 miles
removed from contact with the South.
Mann came down the aisle as Gaines
concluded and in a sarcastic tone said:
"Mr. Chairman,' if the remarks came
from any other member than the gentle
man from Tennessee they, would deserve
a reply, but from' him they; need no an
swer."
As Mann turned his back, Gaines' raised
his right hand menacingly and exclaimed
amid confusion and laughter:
"I want to say that I am responsible
for every word I say." Â¦â¢ ~* , ,-
After .further- discussion a vote^- was
taken on the pending amendment and it
was defeatedâ 6Â§ to 114.
. Another amendment, by Burton of Ohio
striking out the word "Greytown" was
defeatedâ 14 to 73.

BOWERS SUES GEORGE
PULLMAN FOR DAMAGES
Young Merton's body was found near
the hotel In the brush.. It had been hor
ribly mutilated and was doubled up In a
position that indicated that the Intention
of the murderer'had been to place it in a
sack and to sink it In the bay or make
some similar disposition of tho remains.
The young fellow had been attacked with
some blunt instrument- When the body
-was found word was at once sent to thÂ»
provincial police authorities here and they
are now making a thorough investigation.
The theory that the young man had
been murdered by Chinamen was the first
one advanced. Another story that is more
generally believed, however, is. that there
was a married woman figuring very prom
inently in the case, and that the killing of
the young man was the direct result of a
quarrel which Merton and the second and
more moneyed lover of the woman had.
There are at least probabilities. of a so
ciety sensation of large dimensions, ami
all the parties in' the case are well known
here. Young Merton belonged to one 1 of
the most prominent families In Eastern
Canada. His father was the late Sheriff
Merton of Hamilton, Ontario, at one time
a member of Parliament. '.The case has
caused a great deal of local comment. No
arrests have so far been made.

the exact cause of the murder is as mucli
a mystery as the name of the perpetrator
of the crime.

FRANKFORT. Ky.. May 2.â W. H. Cul
ton, the clerk of" Auditor cf State Swee
ney, who is under indictment as accessory
to the murder of Goebel, went on the
witness stand in his own behalf in the
hearing of the motion for. bail. in his case
this afternoon and gave highly sensa
tional testimony. Culton's testimony
came after the motions for bail in the
cases of Powers, Davis, Youtsey, Whit
taker and Combs had been overruled.
The substance of Culton's testimony was
as follows:
I had talks with PoTrers and Taylor about
bringing men' to Frankfort. Taylor wanted
about twentr-nve witnesses from Jackson
County before the canvassing board. I had
another talk with Powers, Cecil, Davidson,
Howard and others. I did not tell the men
who came with me that the Democratic legis
lators were to be killed by raising a row in
the Senate, and I never heard it discussed:
When Berry's contest was to be voted on. I
heard It discussed tbat he was to retain hia
seat, even if voted out. I heard nothing eald
about a plan to kill anybody.
Culton eald W. R. Johnson wanted his
(Culton's) pistol.
Henry Youtsey told . ma that Goebel -would
be killed.'- I told him that It must not be done.
I told Governor Bradley what Youtsey said and
Bradley said:. "My God, this must not be
done." Youtsey afterward said there was noth
ing in it.
Witness said that on the day after the
assassination he was with "Jim" Howard
In the State House yard. Howard called
his attention to a piece of paper posted
in a window.
"Well, what of that?" I asked..
"Oh. you have sense enough to understand,
haven't you?" was Howard's reply.
He said' Howard took out of his pocket
some rifle bullets and also some 45-caliber
pistol cartridges. Howard said:
"Don't ask. any more fool questions."
Henry Youtsey, after the assassination,
asked the witness where he was on the
day of the murder.
I told him that I was up In the lobby of
the House. - Toutsey asked me how It would
do for him to say he was there with me. I
told Youtsey that I was afraid he was going
to get into trouble. Also that Grant Roberts
wanted -to see him. Roberts had missed his
rifle and told me he believed Youtsey had it.
I told him he had better see Roberts.
The -witness told of another conversa
tion with Youtsey, who came with Burton
of Breckinridge County.
Youtsey Â»aid be hadthe greatest scheme yet:
that Goebel could be shot from the Secretary
of State's office and nobody would ever know

has the following from Winston Churchill,

is to establish a line of British posts
from one frontier of the Free State
to ths other at right angles with
the " railway, thus preventing Boer raids
southward. It is essential therefore that
the Boers Ehould be expelled from the
rugged Thaba Nchu district and be forced
to retire to Lady brand. As the result of
the desultory firing Monday and Tues
day, the Boers were puEhed. back a few
jni'es, but nothing definite appears to have
yet been attained. The Boers continue
to follow their harassing tactics. One
â¢well-horsed commando, operating in the
neighborhood of Saunas Post, interferes
Â¦with the British convoys going from
Bloerafontein to Thaba Nchu. The enemy
nearly captured a convoy, but they were
driven off aft*"r a brisk fight-
Preparations for an advance continue
at Kimberley. Sir Alfred Milner has
written to the Mayor of Kimberley assur
ing- him that the relief of Mafeking has
not ceased to occupy his att-ention and
that of the military authorities and that
nothing will be left unturned to raise the
elttfje.
Th* British garrisons along the rail-

LONDON, May 3.â The special corre
spondent of the Daily Telegraph sends the
dispatch:
BLOEMFONTEIN, May 1.â The ' Boers
on Sunday attucked with guns a convoy
of fifty wagons on the Dewetsdorp-Thaba
Nchu road, but were repulsed. The Boers
were handsomely repulsed yesterday and
to-day to the north of Thaba Nchu, the
Gordon Highlanders and Shropshire light
Infantry driving the enemy. from the hills
in disorder. They fled northward. '.-'Col
onel Broadwood's cavalry engaged while
advancing In' three separate 'columns in a
northerly direction a body of Boers who
were proceeding toward .Thaba Nchu . to
i reinforce the enemy near there. The foe
I were checked and drivenlback on Brand
ford. General Tucker also, had a skirmish,
repulsing the Boers. Reports have been
received here to the effect that the Boers
are anxiously asking for terms of peace.
BEKNET BURLEIGH.
ONE KOAD SECURED.
THABA NCHU," May ' 1.â The r Boers
have three guns on the hill to the east
ward of this place, outside the Â¦range- of
the British artillery. > The Boer shelling
ils not doing any damage. The -Â¦ enemy
retain their positions and the British are
not attempting to dislodge -them: ;.
General Hamilton, by reaching; Houtney
after, a full Â¦ day's - fighting 1 , ;â¢ secured * the
Thaba' Nchu-Bloemfontein road. -
"T ONDOft", May 3. â Hard fighting is reported at several points in the Orange Free State, but de
| tails are meager and it is impossible to form a general idea of the scope of operations. The Boars
appear to be concentrated in considerable force along the hills which stretch like an arc or bent
bow from the neighborhood of Karee Siding to Thaba Nchu, to cover the main road from Bloemfon
trin. to Winburg. IÂ«ord Roberts decided on Tuesday to clear the Boers out of three kopjes to the east
of Karee Siding. This was done by mounted infantry, in co-operation with General Maxwell's brigade
moving from Vlakfontein, which had been besieged on the previous day. General Tucker was in com
mand. The Boers abandoned their hide-and-seek tactics, came out in the open plain and suffered severe
losses.' . . "'Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦.-Â¦â¢Â¦Â¦
Â¦_'Â¦.; On the eame day the British forces at Hout Nek, twelve miles north of Thaba Nchu, gained
possession cf a pass com mftrided on both sides by the Boers. The Canadians and Gordons stormed a hill
to the left and the Shropshires and Marshall's Horse attacked in front, driving the Boers in confusion
p> the north-
The object of these movements is evidently to try to thrust the Boers back far to the east and
snake their intrenchments at Brandfort untenable, thus clearing the way for the troops moving up from
Bloemf ontein.
Some desultory shelling and sniping at Warrenton, which has been daily reported, continues. Gen
eral Sir Frederick Carrington has arrived at Marandella depot on the Bsira-Salisbury Railway, where
stores have been collected for his expedition. Colonel Plumer is once more said to be moving cautiously
along the line of the railway toward Mafeking. . > J V? â¢;

SALT LAKE, May 2.â A special" to the
Herald from Sconeld, Utah; says: It
seems that at least 250 men have been
killed in the mine accident. The accurate
figures cannot be given and will not be
known for some days. The mine manag
ers say it will be impossible to secure a
list of names until the dead bodies have
been brought out and identified.
Superintendent Sharp says there were
300 men In the mine at the time of the ex
plosion. Of these It is impossible to ac
count for more than sixty. In the turmoil
and confusion those who escaped cannot
be seen. There is a great variance be
tween the licrures given by Superintendent
Sharp and those given by Mine Superin
tendent Parmley.
The following are ITS names of those
who have been recovered and some re
maining in the mine:

severely bruised.
Three hundred and ninety-eight men en

VICTIMS WHO HAVE
BEEN IDENTIFIED
SALT LAKE, Utah, May 2. â Rescue work has been going on steadily all day at the Scofleld mlnÂ«
and reports as to the dead are conflicting 1 . According to the latest advices the claim is made that
149 bodies have been taken out and identified. Twenty or more bodies are said to be mangled be
yond recognition and every hour is adding further victims to the list. No one seems to know Just how
many were in the mine at the time of the accident, but it is estimated that between 3OO and 40O were
at work when the accident occurred, and that the list of dead may reach 25O when all the' bodies are
found. - , â¢
While numerous theories have been advanced as to the cause of the explosion nothing is yet defi
nitely known on that point.. ;\V: â¢ â¢ t - .<..-:
The relief is being organized into two shifts, and the one now in the mine has fifty bodies ready
to bring out.
Arriving trains are bringing relatives of the victims from all points. The coal company has ap
pointed a committee to carry the dead to Salt Lake, Ogden and other points.'
V ;V ;~6n account of the gas No. 4 mine has been abandoned as a means of rescue and bodies are arriv
ing at the mouth of No. 1 mine by the carload. Ferrish level has been cleared of dead and all arÂ«
, burned and unrecognizable..
SALT LAKE, May 2.-Every house in
the little town of Scofleld 13 a house
o* mourning. The awful scene of
yesterday had passed away when
the day dawned this morning and
the awful calm of despair had taken
its place. The agonized shrieks of the
widows and the moans of the fatherless
were no longer heard. The stricken ones
were beyond all that and their grief could
find no utterance.
When the removal of the bodies from
the mine befan yesterday hundreds of
men volunteered their services for the
purpose. These rescuers came from other
mines and towns surrounding, and work
ed Incessantly to bring out the burned
and mangled remains of the dead miners.
The bodies were' taken to the company
buildings as soon as .'they were brought
out of the mine, and were there dressed
and laid out preparatory to the Coroner's
Inquest and for Identification. Many of
the rescuers came near losing their lives
from thei fatal afterdamp, but the work
was continued in the face of all danger;
and most of the brave lellows remained at
their posts until they were almost ready
to drop from physical exhaustion and the
deadly elfectD of the poisonous fumes.
John Klrton was the tirst man brought
to the surface. He was still alive, but
presented a terrible sight. His scalp was
Durned to a cinder and his face was al
most unrecognizable. In his horrible pain
he cried out to his companions, begging
them to end his misery by taking his life,
{superintendent Sharp sent his valiant
workers to their Ik-cls. and was himself
the last to leave. "As he came down the
hill, attired in a rough miner's suit, his
face blackened with coal %lust and his
eyes almost starting from their sockets,
his every move told of the terrible ordeal
he had gone through while working with
the rescuing party underground. Nearly
all the bodies he found were those of men
personally known to him, and his voice
trembled as he described what he had
seen. Yet he kept hi3 nerves and had al
v.ays a quiet word of comfort for the af
flicted and wise counsel for the forces of
workers. When active work ceased at the
tnlnea 137 dead had been recovered. Fifty
of these were laid In a row in the little
meeting house of the Latter-Day Saints,
while othera were stretched out in the im
provised morgue, just nt> they were found
in the mine, awaiting the touch of rough
but loving hands to compose their limbs,
wash the dust from their faces and close
their staring eyes.
According to the closest estimate there
were about 400 men all told employed at
these two mines, which are practically
one mine. About fifty of these were work
ins' in what is known as the No. 1 back
level and raise, so far from the explosion
that it had spent its force before the
shock could reach them and they all got
out. They heard the report, but did not
prasp the situation at once, one of the
men continuing to load a car after it oc
curred.
The terrible sweep that death has made
may be illustrated by a few of the strik
ing incidents that have so far developed.
John Muir, ono of the oldest residents and
a well-known miner, perished almost side
by side with his two sons and his son-in
law, G. BJorr.son. Only the two widows
are left as the broken remnants of this
family circle. ! Of another family eight
perished. They were Robert Hunter, three
Bons and four nephews. Of course, each
death was a pathetic one, but the very
climax of sadness was reached In some.
John James was accompanied Inside by
his boy. They were trying to escape to
the mouth of the tunnel when the deadly
damp overtook them and a moment later
they were dead. When found by the res
cuers their arms were tightly clasped
about each other in an embrace that
death could not loosen.-
Will Clark, an employÂ© of the company.
was working outside, and with hundreds of
others rushed to the mouth of the tun
nel. HIb father and brother were both
inside, and, wild with grief, he Joined the
first party of rescuers. When the word
to enter was given he dashed recklessly
ahead to commence the search for his
dear ones, when the lurking damp en
veloped him as in a winding sheet and he
was dead before aid could reach him.
Three men ' were found by the rescuers
near the mouth alive, but unconscious.
They were hurried outside and it was
hoped all were saved. John Lloyd died
as they were carrying him to the board
ing-house. John Kirton is not. expected
to live Â¦ and only one, William Boweter,
was able to walk away.
David Padfield and Will Jones, chums,
were found by the latter's brother. Evan
Jones, who was In Torrey's Rough Riders.
Evan pays that when he came upon them
they were locked in each other's arms.
He dropped down by them, called them
by name and says both opened their eyes
and looked at him and then died. .
Former Mine Inspector Forrester had a
very close call. He was found near the
mouth of the tunnel, having just gone in.
and was quickly rescued. Aa soon as he
recovered he went right back in the mine
to aid the relief party and was again
brought out in an unconscious condition.
He was carried to his room and upon re
covering once more returned to aid in
directing the work.
Superintendent Parmeley headed one
rescuing party. He was the first one in
the mine and the last to leave it. His
brother, Foreman William Parmeley, per
ished in No. 4.
One of the miners sent over from Castle
Gate to aid In the rescue work talked
interestingly when he came out of the
tunnel.
"This explosion Is the most disastrous so
far as loss of life la concerned, that has
ever occurred in America," said he..
"There will be more than 200 dead found
before we are through work. In the great
explosion at Almy, Wyo., a few years ago,
sixty-seven were killed. We had some
hard experiences to-day going through the
mine. Several times members of our party
were overcome by the damp, but we got
them out in time. We found the bodies
of the men In every conceivable shape, but
generally they were lying on their stom
achs with thoir arms about their faces.
The men died almost instantly when
struck by the damp and did not suffer.
They just became unconscious and were
asphyxiated. Their faces were all calm
and peaceful as though they had just fall
en asleep. The men in No. 1 might pos
ribly have escaped had they started to run
as soon as the explosion in No. 4. which is
connected with it, occurred. Evidently
they did not apreclate this fact until too
late as they put on their coats and ar
ranged their tools before starting. They
started, however, just In time to meet the
clamp half way. The bodies found near
the entrance are badly crushed and bruis
ed as they got the full forcf of the ex
plosion. They are few in number, how
over. Mine No. 1 is damaged compara
tively little, but No. 4 is badly damaged."
Dan Davis, well known to Utah Welsh
men, is among the dond. and David T.
Evans, a favorite amateur actor here,
perished in the mine. The three Gath
erum brothers of Provo have been taken
out dead.
Superintendent W. G. Sharp resumed
work with a will at S o'clock when a res
cuing party of sixteen, directed by State
Mine Inspector Gonier Thomas, and in
cluding Messrs. Sharp. Frank Cameron,
superintendent at Castle Gate, and James
Harrison, entered the tunnel of No. 1. It
was not long before the bodies commenced
to come out.
All efforts now are being concpntrated
to bring out a large number of bodies
known to be in No. 4. where eighty-five
men perished. Here the force of the ex
plosion broke down the timbers, and the
bodies can only be pot at through No. 1.
-Up to noon 149 bodies had been brought
out.
, A sad picture was presented at the
mouth of No. 4 tunnel, where with drawn
features and haggard face pat young
John Miller of Helper waiting for the
bodies of his three brothers. Harry.
Ttance and Isaac, to be brought out. E.
J. Roe. a young man. who was workling
in the bottom of No. 6 shaft, bears on his
person the evidence of his frightful ex
perience. His face is a mass- of lacera
<lons from the flying slack, while his head
is cut and his body bruised, but he is
alive and thankful. When the damp
struck him he was literally knocked out
of Immediate danger and some instinct
guided the blinded and almost senseless
man to the pure air,
Sam Wycherly, the well-known volun
teer who served in Battery M, had an
even more thrilling experience. The force
of the explosion from the No. G raise car
ried him clear beyond the damp zone, and
to-day he Is plucklly serving with a res
cue party.
The theory of Bishop Parmeley Is that
some of the Finns recently imported se
cretly took giant powder down Into the
mine to assist them In their work. They
were exceedingly anxious to make a good
showing and as much money as possible,
and it is thought that this form of ex
i plosive was used in order that great bod
ies of coal could be more easily dislodged.
It is thought that when the giant powder
was touched off it ignited some of the
dust of which every coal mine in the
country has more or less.
Inquiry among the miners disclosed the
fact that they entertained various opin
ions regarding the terrible affair, some
being exceedingly bitter in their denun
ciation of the company and others took a
more conservative view of the matter and
said It was one of those things over
which no man has control and for which
no man or men should be held responsi
ble.

At the conference on freight matters
yesterday morning It was practically de
cided not to disarrange the present out
going rates from common points in the
United States to Oriental ports. A single
exception was made in the case of paper,
where it was practically agreed to reduct
the rate from Jl to SO cents. However, the
matter will not be finally decided until to
day. .
The matter of Inbound tariffs, which is
the real meat of the conference, is stlU
under discussion and will not be deter
mined until the final vote is taken. Vice
President Paul Morton of the Santa Fe
expressed the opinion last night that the
conference will finish Its labors to-day.
No one will venture an opinion as to what
the outcome will be. There is a rumor
that the conference will amount to noth

This coach'ing paper is sent to you
for you to learn by heart and not fail
to remember. By and by when you
arrive at San Francisco and the
Custom-house mtn ask you one ques
tion, answer one question. Don't talk
too much nor talk all kinds of ways.
This is to fool the foreigners. Two

and burn it so that the Custom-house
men in searching your things should
not find it. Most important.
While the ring of attorneys Is reaping a
rich harvest of profit in an Illegitimate
trade the Collector of the Port has de
clared that after landing- 3000 "native
sons" he has come to the conclusion that
he has no right, to deal with men who
claim American citizenship. Accepting
his own judgment he might be disturbed
to explain by what authority he has a
right to land "native daughters." The
Collector of the Port has decided that In
dependent of any regulation which may
have .been made by the Secretary ! of the
Treasury he has power to deal only with
aliens.
: A few days ago he said ,. that' he would
give in writing the following decision. to
all attorneys for Chinese native-born citi

the water is for cooking. The kitchen
is in the rear of the store. I lived
with my father and mother. The
inner part has two rooms. I lived in
one and my father and mother lived
in the other. They carried on their
business in the front part."
When they ask you if your Uncle
Wai Kwun, when he was back in
China, lived in the same village you
did, answer: "Not the same. He
lived in Lun Ning. in the Wai Ka
village. 4 1 lived in Canton. I have
never yet been to his village."
When they ask what your uncle
is now doing in San Francisco, an
swer: "Before he was on Commercial

Under the laws of the United States the
masters of ships and the agents of steam
ship companies are subjected to heavy
penalties if they permit Chinese passen
gers to leave the .vessels upon which they
come; to "this port without authority, of
law. In allowing the Chinese who are now
on the Mall dock to leave the China. ; the
.Doric and the Nippon Maru, the officers
of the Pacific Mail have made themselves
amenable to these, laws.and it" is within
the. Jurisdiction of the United States Dis
trict Attorney to institute an investiga
tion. ; There are on the Mall dock; Chinese
passengers i and applicants for admlssior.

these thirty-six are "native sons," who
have been! denied -admission.'-: It Is with In'
the authority. of. the' United States District
Attorney to Investigate why these coolies
have not \ been sent ] back to China.': :. That
they have not been sent back is one ofthe
startling facts which reveal the character
of ; ,the outrageous Chinese * trafflcVat.'"' this
These coolie native, sons, merchants,
tourists, students and native daughters
are remaining on the dock as long as the
agents of the Pacific Mail Steamship Com
pany care to keep them there. The coolie
immigrants and "citizens" are waiting
for developments and they may wait for
months. Every day's delay Is profit to the
Pacific Mail. ,
The law declares that the master of a
vessel and' the official representatives of
the corporation for which he works shall
be criminally and . civilly responsible for
the Illegal landing of any Chinese. There
are now on the'dock of the Pacific Mall
Steamship Company over 200 Chinese who
have no right to leave the vessel upon
which they arrived at this port until they
had been., legally landed. The 'Pacific
Mail Steamship Company is maintaining
on its dock a boarding-house for the ac
commodation of these 'Chinese. It Is
estimated that the steamship company Is
making a profit of $1000 a month from
these Chinese, as 37V4 "cents a .day is
charged for. each Chinese. Â¦-â¢ . â¢
It would seem from this that the Collec
tor of the Port has blundered in landing
his "native sons" and "native daughters,"
and the- members of the ring have taken
him at his word. They have not attempt
ed to begin mandamus proceedings, but
have applied for writs of habeas corpus.
And while they: are attempting to land
their natives at this port the Pacific Mall
Steamship Company is reaping a harvest
of unwarranted profit and a penalty of
the violation of Federal laws.
"I have been studying the law on this
matter, and I have concluded that the
Chinese exclusion act and the treaty. were
made for application to alien Chinese and
not to Chinese born In the United States.
Such being the fact, in my opinion, I have
no authority to consider thelf right of ad
mission at all. The exclusion act is not
for them. They may appeal to State
courts on habeas corpus, for every native
of the United States may appeal to a Su
perior court or to a Federal court in like
cases. After I j refuse i to consider these
cases the attorneys for the passengers or
immigrants have a remedy in a man
damus proceeding to compel me to pass
upon this class of cases. Thus the ques
tion of my Jurisdiction will be determined
by the court. If the court says that I
have the Jurisdiction and the authority I
shall be obliged to handle the native born
cases as before. I want to get rid of the
whole business if I can. I am of the opin
ion that the Treasury Department cannot
make a law to force me to decide on
American citizenship." *
Continuing, he declared:
been made to me by the within named
Chinese person on the ground that he is a
native-born citizen of the United States,
I have refused to entertain application Oi
to consider same, deeming the matter not
within my jurisdiction and considering
that I have no legal authority In tne
premises to hear or to consider said ap
plication or to render any finding, judg
ment or order in the matter. I therefore
refuse to order the applicant to be land
ed or to deny him a landing at this port."
"Why, this Is all a mistake," said Pres
ident Kilburn of the board, urbanely.
"We're getting an elegant wharf down
there at Howard street. I've been going
down there myself. Cylinders built short?
Oh, no. Some may have been cut off
because they could not be driven down
the full- length, but none were put In
short. Tes, we'll certainly investigate
any charges of crookedness. We have an
unusually competent inspector down there,
Mr. Duff. Nothing is going wrong."
"Why should it be necessary to change
the lengths of the cylinders at all?" was
asked of Chief Kngineer Holmes. "Why
wasn't a correct survey made at the
start?" .
"Well, my assistant, Mr. Ryan, made
the survey," was the response. "Of course
I depend on him and my inspector. Mr.
Duff. I 6ee the work every day, though."
Mr; Ryan declined to talk when swn at

and thus faulty. The contractors are
saving nearly $10,000 by all this, the story
?roes, and the State is getting an improper

Some of the contractors Â¦who spoke of
the charges said the claim might be made
by the chief engineer that their cylinders
had been shortened because it had been
found unnecessary- to put them down as
far as the specifications called for. In
this case, .they declared, a faulty survey
had been made or else the Improvement
' Company had been informed before bid
ding that the cylinders need not be as
long as the specifications contemplated.
"Yes. it's a fact that a few of the cylin
ders were built shorter than the specifica
tions- provided." said Chief Engineer
Holmes yesterday, "but only about four
feet shorter. I had the right under the
specifications to permit the shortening.

tions call for second-class fir."

Ryan gave as his reason for not noti
fying the board of what was going on
that It should always receive its reports
from Holmes.
. Inspector Duff said Engineer Holmes
assumed control of the work. He ac
knowledged the shortages of the cylinders
to Mr. Kyan. Nothing can be found In
the specifications giving the chief engi
neer authority to lessen the lengths of
the cylinders. Modifications of contracts
rest entirely with the board and the board
has made no modification In this case.
The Slate should receive the benefit of all

Several cylinders are now being built
on, the dock. They are built of knotty
lumber and the lengths are spliced. An
Inch stream of water was noticed pour
ing through a knot hole in a cylinder that
had been driven down and was being filled
with concrete. . '.-
W. E. Dennison; secretary of the City
Street Improvement Company, said when
questioned, not knowing of acknowledg
ments already made by Holmes, that only
"ships planks" were being used In con
structing the cylinders, and that every
one of them was the full length provided
for in the specification. Jealous contract
ors were creating the trouble," he sam.
Henry L. Ryan was- formerly County
Surveyor of San Diego County, chief en

engineer of the Elslnore Irrigation Com

Engineer Ryan is Commissioner Har
ney's brother-in-law. It had been ar
ranged to promote Holmes In September
by making him consulting engineer and
to give Ryan his place. The present
trouble may bring about a change of pro
gramme.
Engineer Hlnes of the City Street Im
provement Company was for four years
Mr. Holmes' assistant, and it is stated
was connected with him in the business
for a time.

lesterday, immediately upon learning
that inquiry was being made concerning
his scheme. Holmes filed an official com
munication with the board, notifying it
of his Intention to provide for the use of
his cylinder in the new work.
The expense of constructing the cylinder
called for at the Howard-street dock,
properly and of full length, may be judged
oy the fact that contracting firms receiv
ed bids irom manufacturers of them offer
ing to furnish the entire 162 cylinders for
J16.000 to $20,000. The City Street Improve
ment Company Is making its own cylin
ders.
On March 10 a payment of $15,591 96 was
made by the board to the City Street Im
provement Company, which Is 75 per cent
on an estimate of $20,789 28, though at that
time no work had been done on the
wharf. The payment was made on ma

specifications providing that payments

were removed.
"Look here," exclaimed Holmes in an
ger. "You're making statements that
would lead people to suppose something
wrong was going on."
"Yes, and there Is," rejoined Ryan in
equal anger, "and you know it.'"
Other angry words followed and Holmes
left the room. Outside he said:
"There was no survey made for the
work. I made water soundings and -that
"That fellow Is a traitor. He has a
knife up his sleeve for me. My record is

"I have been employed by this board

Is trying to shift responsibility. I have
told him all along what has been golrfg

each cylinder shall be made of timber of

or his subordinates were questioned.
Engineer Holmes was called and then
it was that the row resulting in the
charges took place.
"Do you know of any of those cylinders
being short?" was asked of Mr. Ryan
after Mr. Holmes had given him permis
sion to answer questions.
"Yes, I do." responded Ryan. "Of the
whole 10S on the inner row none was less
than five feet short."
"What's that?" demanded Holmes.
"That's a funny statement."
"How about the lumber In them?" was
asked.
"It's all second class," was Ryan's re
ply.
"Is it up to the specifications?"
"Certainly not â it's not ship plank nor
anywhere near it."
"It's all clear, merchantable lumber,
isn't it?" queried Holmes.
"No. it's not. It's very knotty, most of
it. Why, I've seen knots fall out of it
while the cylinders were being driven
down."
"Was there more than a five-foot short
age In any of the cylinders?" was asked
of Ryan.
"Some of them were ten feet short,"
was the reply.
"How about the removal of abandoned

SOME days ago the United States Senate turned
aside from learned debates on the constitution;
perfcrvid oratory on expansion, wrangling
over the seating of Quay, and gave attention to a pe
tition from 2000 citizens of Washington asking the
repeal of a law now in force requiring the muzzling
of dogs running at large in the District of Columbia.
The petition was presented and supported by Sena
tor Gallinger, who in reply to a question whether a
repeal of the law would not leave the community ex
posed to danger of hydrophobia, -replied: VI prac
ticed medicine thirty years and never sawl a case of
hydrophobia, and I have asked a great many emi
nent surgeons who have spent a lifetime in the hos
pitals of the United States, who said to me that they
never saw a case of hydrophobia. -* * * Some
young scientist in Washington, for", the purpose, as I
believe, of sclf-gloriiication, made an examination of
a dog's brain and came to the conclusion that the dog
had rabies. Immediately that was reported, and this
law was the result. *. * * I Ido not believe there
has been a case of rabies in the District of Columbia
this year, last year, nor the year before; nor have I
the least apprehension that if these poor dogs are al
lowed the freedom that man's best friend ought to
have we will be troubled with hydrophobia as a re
sult."
That statement at once called forth replies from
Senators who had in the slack of their memories in
stances of hydrophobia. Senator Vest said: "I re
member when I was a young man I sat up with an
associate who died with all the symptoms of hydro
phobia. He was thrown into convulsions by the ap
pearance of water and barked like a dog. One of the
most celebrated surgeons of the time, Dr., Ben Dud
ley.'pronounced it hydrophobia."
To that story Gallinger replied that "barking like
a dog is not a symptom of hydrophobia and cannot be
found in any book, notwithstanding the popular
opinion that it is a sure symptom of the disease."
Senator Wolcott cited the act of the Home Secre
tary of Great Britain, who once enforced an order
that no dog in the United Kingdom should go with
out a muzzle and that no'person should be permitted
under any circumstances to bring a dog into Great
Britain. "Up to that time," said Wolcott, "there
had been the death of thousands of cattle. There had
been many persons who' died of hydrophobia. He
persisted in his order against all the ignorant physi
cians and mock humanitarians and people who care v d
more for dogs than for human beings in the United
Kingdom, and the agony column of the Times was
filled day nftcr day with attacks upon him. But he
persisted in his order, with the result that-hydro
phobia has been absolutely stamped out in Great
Britain. * * * Only the other day we were hear
ing of thousands and thousands of dollars' worth of
valuable blooded cattle in the State of New Jersey
that were compelled to be killed because dogs with
hydrophobia ran with them." * \
Senator* Gallinger replied^ "I have been delighted
to hear this learned medicarand scientific exposition
from the Senator from Colorado. I believe the Sen
ator has been misinformed. I do not believe' a word
of it. and I 'go on, record as not believing 1 a wonl
of it." : -. .
Then Senator Bacon said: "I myself lost seven.-or
eight valuable head of cattle bitten by dogs and that
died with" every symptom of hydrophobia. . Whether
it is hydrophobia or not I do not know.- Certainly it
is a disease which is communicated by the bite of a
dog. and the animals die with the symptoms which
are generally reputed to be those of hydrophobia."
To that Gallinger scorned to reply. The' petition
was referred to the Committee on the District of Co
lumbia, and the Senate proceeded' to unmuzzle itself
on other issues. So far.-as Congress is concerned,
therefore, the hydrophobia; controversy remains " uif
scttlcd, and we shall probably have to take a vote of
the. people on it.

\A R. WILLIS J. ABBOTT, who is widely ad
/, \ vertised and justly celebrated as the press
manager of the Bryan Democratic National
Committee, has issued the platform, on which he says
the Silver Republicans* hereafter to be known and
hailed as ihe "LincpJn Republican League," will
nominate Mr. Bryan for the Presidency.
It s< to be in the following words and phrases, to
w it: â¢ ' - - ' .
"1, Bimetallism: gold and silver as standard
money, with equally unrestricted coinage and equal
debt-paying power. This plank, however, will con
tain a qualifying clause admitting that the gold stan
dard is fixed upon the nation for a period, and that
the financial question is therefore in this campaign
nccessardy subordinated to others of paramount im
portance".
"2. No forcible territorial aggrandizement nor
'criminal aggression": independence for the Filipinos,
with protection by the United States.
"3. The restoration of the great Americanism of
Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln, with its old-time
American independence, and the dethronement of the
little Americanism of McKinley, Hanna and Roose
vrlt umier. the protectorate of English Ton-ism.
"4. Trusts. The removal of protective duty from
all products which enter into trust monopolies; public
ownership in att instances where, it shall be shown
thaj the public can thereby be. best protected from
prn-ate monopoly... - â¢ ' .
'"S.-A. graduated ir.come tax.' V
"6. The initiative and referendum.
\s. '."7- An attack on the Republican currency law and
a demand thai the nation, not the banks, shall issue
money. . - ; - v -.. .. ";' . : ' : ;
"8. Civil sen-ice reform and a denunciation 5f the
record of the McKmley administration as a shameless
surrender to and extension of the spoils system.
"9. A warning against the surrender of the republic
to commercialism and the supplanting of government
'by, of and for the people,' by an oligarchy."
These issues, all ready-made, will be seen to ex
actly tally with the Democratic platform forecast by
Bryan and Altgeld. ; Mr. Abbott admits, in advance,
for the Silver Republicans that the gold standard U
settled, and subordinates that issue. But if the gold
standard is the parents and the grandparents of such
gigantic evils as Bryan foresaw in 1896 and predicts
now, why subordinate that issue to any other?
There is only one answer. The gold standard can
not be successfully assaulted. It is supported by a
vast majority of the people. In establishing it by law
the Republican party has simply responded to the de
mands of the people. If it were the crime these Popu
liftic politicians have been mouthing about it shouM

GEORGE W.LEWIS.
THE construction and permanent
maintenance of an interoceanic ea
nal across the Isthmus, connecting
the waters of the Atlantic and Pa
cific, 13 without question a matter
of paramount importance. It is of
vital importance not alone to the United
States but to the whole maritime world.
It is a matter of international Importance.
The Clayton-Bulwer treaty and the Hay-
Pauncefote treaty contemplate that the
canal, with its approaches, shall.be for
ever neutral, "in time of war as in timÂ»
of peace." In fact, all the treaties reÂ»
lating to that matter, which have been
ratified between the United States and
other nations, must unequivocally estab
lish and maintain the "general principle"
of neutrality. All the treaties ratified be
tween the United States and the Central
and South American republics relating to
an interoceanic communication j contain
express and specific stipulations to that
effect. And upon a broad and 'unbiased
consideration of the question it must be
conceded that the neutrality of the canal,
supported by the joint action of all the
great maritime powers, will afford the
only safeguard and protection, to the im
mense capital Invested, and to the perma
nent maintenance and utility of the great
waterway. . *. .
A work of such vast international im
portance can only be maintained "in time
of war as in time of peace" by insuring
its complete neutrality, with equal rights
and privileges accorded to all the marl
time powers of the world.
A fortified canal under the control of
one nation, to the exclusion of equal
rights and privileges of other nations in
its use, would in times of war be a stand-
Ing invitation for an attack from the ex
cluded nation. A fortified canal would be
a standing menace to the capital invested
In' its construction and maintenance. It
would be a menace to the integrity and
sovereignty of the Central American re
publics, especially Nicaragua, Costa Rica
and Honduras. A fortified canal would
tend to make not only the canal and Its
approaches but the republics of Central
America the arena of contending armies.
Besides, if by reason of its fortification,
and exclusive use by one nation, the canal
should, in time of war, become a bone of
contention, it would be endangered, not
alone from the conflict of contending
armies but a few explosives, stealthily
applied, would destroy its utility. But
with its protection and neutrality guar
anteed by all the great maritime powers
of the' world, with equal rights and privi
leges accorded all, "in time of war as in
time of peace," it would forever remain
for the interest -of each nation to be vigi
lant In promoting its protection and main
taining its neutrality. . -. '
Under such" circumstances each nation
would equally hold a vested interest In
the enterprise, and there could be no mo
tive on the part of any to violate these
conditions and guarantees. But should
any nation encroach upon its guaranteed
rig'hts swift and summary punishment
would be visited upon the malfeasor at the
hands of the signatory powers. In the
war between Turkey and Russia the safe
ty of the Suez canal, which was located
almost wholly within tho territory of one
of the belligerents, was due entirely to
the fact of the joint guarantee of the
European powers. Under that guarantee
thesphere of operations in the war were
not extended to the canal. But had it
been fortified and under the exclusive con
trol- of one of the belligerents, it could
scarcely have escaped destruction..
A bill authorizing the Government of
the United States to fortify the Nicaragua
cannl Is now before Congress. But does
it not occur to the most casual reader that
its enactment into law would be futile and
of no force or effect? Under or by virtue
of such an act of Congress this Govern
ment would â¢.have ne-ther the right nor
authority to invade th<2 sovereignty of the
republic of Nicaragua. It would havo no
right or authority to erect fortifications
at the approaches of the canal.- or to ex
tend a line of fcrtre^es through the heart
of an independent republic. Under such
a statute the United States would have no
authority to invade the sovereign domain
of Nicaragua, or to establish forts, ar
8*>nals and military posts along the banks
of the canal within the sovereign domain
of that republic. Congress. unquestionably,
has the constitutional authority to declare
war against a foreign ' nation. But by
what authority can Congress authorize
the Government of the United States to
Invade the dominions- of a foreign nation
with whpm we are ;it peace.' and to estab
lish and' maintain within its sovereignty
forts, arsenals, and military posts? The
invalidity, if not- imbecility, of such- an
act of Congress is too apparent to call for
further comment. ThÂ»5 Senate Committee
on Foreign Relations; acting- along the
same line, has proposed an amendment to
the .Hay-Pauncefote treaty, giving, the
United States authority to fortify the in
l.eroceanie waterway. But should the
amendment be adopted, and the treaty as
amended ratified by the United States and
Gr^at Britain, this Government would still
remain without the vestige of right or au
thority to erect or maintain fortifications
within the natural domain of; Nicaragua.
By what authority can England give this
Government the right- to "invade the
realms of an .independent; sister .republic
and extend our military operations within
its sovereign domain? Could any one for
a- moment- imagine that Nicaragua, by
treaty, or; otherwise, could vest; the Gov
ernment ofithe Unittd, States with the.
authority to erect fortifications at the
mouth of Â¦ the Thames, or the Clyde, or to
establish. and v maintain fortresses, arsen
als and military posts along. the banks of
those rivers? Yet, the one Is as legitimate
as the other. ! .
The fact that Great.. Britain : and the
United states" are powerful: nations and
Nicnragua n weak republic cuts no figure
in. the question -of. authority. - Fora, na
tion, however r-mall and weak, has all the
rights of sovereignty within- its domain
that the most powerful- empire has. And
these rights are entitled to equal respect/
-But the pending bill if enacted into law
and; the amended â¢ treaty if ratified' are
equally, futile and vest this Government

On the 12th day of December. 1S46. a
treaty was concluded between the United
States and the Republic of New Granada,
now known as Colombia, or the United
States of Colombia.. This was the flrst
treaty relating to an interoceanic canal.
It was ratified, and on the 12th day of
June, 1S48. proclaimed. Under Its protec
tion the Panama Canal Company, com
posed mostly of residents of New York,
was organized In the city of New York,
and the road was completed. But in re
turn for the concessions granted, the
Lnited States {article XXXV) guaranteed
the "neutrality" of the entire Isthmus of
Panama and the "sovereignty" of New-
Granada over that territory. This treaty
.was concluded and ratified under the ad
ministration of James K. Polk. In his
.message of February 10, 1847, communicat
ing the treaty to the Senate_for Its consid
j eration, the President said:
It will be perceived by the thirty
fifth artfele of the treaty that New
Granada proposes to guarantee to
the Government and citizens of the
United States the right of passage
across the Isthmus of Panama,
over natural roads and over any
canal or railroad which may be
constructed to unite the two seas,
on condition that the United States
make a similar guaranty to New
Granada of the neutrality of this
portion of the territory and her
sovereignty over the same. â¢ â¢ â¢
In entering into the neutral guar
antees proposed by the thirty-fifth
article of the treaty neither the
Government of Xew Granada nor
that of the United States has any.
narrow exclusive views. â¢ â¢ â¢ If
the United States, as the chief of
the American nations, should first
become a party to this guaranty it
cannot be doubtedâ Indeed, it is
confidently expected by the Gov
ernment of New Granadaâ that
similar guarantees will bÂ« given to
that republic by Great Britain and
France. â¢ â¢ â¢ Besides, such a
guaranty is almost indispensable to
the construction of a railroad or
canal across that territory. Neither
sovereign states nor individuals
would expend their capital in tho
construction of these expensive*
works without some such security
for their investments. New Gra
nada is a power which will not ex
cite the jealousy of any nation. If
Great Britain, Ffance or the United
t States held the sovereignty over
the isthmus, other nations might
apprehend that Jn case- of war the
Government would close up the
passage against the enemy, but no
such fears can be entertained In
regard to New Granada.
These views of President Polk In regard
to the question of neutrality met the ap
proval of the United States Senate at that
time, and were, in fact, the prevailing
sentiment of the country. These views,
establishing "a general principle of neu
trality" were embodied in the Clayton-
Bulwer treaty of 1S50 and in the treaty
between the United States and Nicaragua
in 1867. They are also embodied in the
Hay-Pauncefote treaty. All these treaties
are in harmony with each oth*Â»r in estab
lishing the "general . principle" of . neu
trality. And they all contemplate that
fhe interocean-. communication shall be
forever neutral, with equal rights and
privileges accorded to. all nations "In time
of war ah in time of peace."
- These treaties respectively contemplate
that the protection and neutrality of. any
interoceanic communication shall "be guar
anteed" by-the joint action of the great
maritime powers. And we see no reason
to call in question the soundness of these
views. . Not' only that, since the ratifica
tion of< the Clayton-Bulwer treaty Great
Britain ' and 'â¢France--.- havo entered Into
treaty relations with s.fverafof the Span
ish-American republics, establishing the
same "general principle" â¢ o& protection
and Neutrality. As early as Andrew ;
Jackson's administration there was an at
tempt to negotiate a treaty embodying the
same "general, principle" cf. neutrality. On
March 3. 1S33. the United States Senate
adopted the following. resolution:
Resolved. .That the. President of
the United States, be respectfully
requested to consider the expe
diency of opening negotiations with
the governments of Central Amer
ica and New Granada for the pur
pose of effectually protecting, by
suitable treaty stipulations with
them, such individuals- or rompa
: nles as may undertake to open a
. communication between the Atlan
tic and Pacific oceans by the con
struction of h chip canal across the .
. isthmus which. connects North and
South America, and of securing
forever by such stipulations the
free and equal right of navigating
Â¦- such canal to all nations/ on pay- 'â¢Â¦
ment of such reasonable tolls as
may be established to compensate^
Â¦ the capitalists who may engage in
such undertaking and complete the/
. work. ...-.-.
This met the 'hearty approval of An
drew Jackson. Hnd he at* once took steps
to .negotiate treaties in compliance with
recommendations of tho resolution. "While
the 'invalidity of the proposed amendment
to the Hay-Pauncefote treaty anrt of the

give us no such authority. Nicaragua
alone can vest the United States with that
authority. But she Has never done so.
She has repeatedly- xefused. And even,

HAY-PAUNCEFOTE TREATY
AND THE NICARAGUA CANAL
The Cullom interstate commerce bill is one. of the
most important measures now before Congress, and
if there has been a conspiracy to suppress it in com
mittee a gross outrage has been committed against
public interests. The League of National Associa
tions speaks with authority, and the accused Senators
will have to explain.
Since, that time every effort; on the part of the
chairman to get-the committee to report the bill has
failed, and the. league concludes that the-intention to
suppress the measure "is obvious." "The circular let
ter adds: "It may. be instructive to consider the per
sonnel of, the- committee to' ;which all -legislation af
fecting transportation must go before it! can even
come to the attention -of 1 the United States Senate.
There are: "Senator. Wokott of Colorado, general
counsel of the Denver and Rio Gratide Railway;
Senator Gear of Iowa, father-in-law of J. W. Blythe,
general solicitor of the Chicago,' Burlington and
Quincy railway system (who has been here for
a time) ; Senator Lindsay ' of Kentucky, formerly
counsel for the Louisville and- Nashville Railway;
Senator Elkins of West Virginia, vice president of the
West Virginia Central and Pittsburg Railway;- Sena
tor Kean of New Jersey, closely allied as a capitalist
with the Pennsylvania Railway; Senator Aldrich of
Rhode Island, as closely" allied with the railway and
corporation interests of his section. - These gentlemen
(a majority of the committee) are all understood to
be violently opposed t6~the bill. They naturally
would be. Some have not even deigned to attend the
hearings upon it; others go. so far, when speaking
of the railroads in committee, as to use the pronoun
'we.' "
The course taken by the committee after the hear
ing of February 20 appears to confirm the report as
to the intention of the majority to suppress the bill.
The circular of the league goes on to say that another
three weeks elapsed before the committee had a
quorum again, and the chairman; then announced a
determination to close the hearings." Three v days,
March 23, March 30 and April 6, were assigned for
the opponents of the .bill to present their views.
On the first two days the opposition made no show
ing whatever, button the last day "the representatives
of the^railrdads, the only opponents of the bill, made
their'appearance .withVa - mass of testimony too
voluminous: to be'- received during the" time allotted,
and therefore that; hearing was adjourned to April 13,
when it was. completed." ;-.
only answer has been that if this.be done the people
shall know the facts, so as to place the responsibility
\\hcre it belongs."
THE Board of Supervisors is considering a reso
lution for the acquisition of a municipal tele
phone system, to be operated by underground
xronduits -and to accommodate, fifty thousand sub
scribers. 4\:l-:. 'â¢Â£
The resolution invites bids on such a system. By
this we assume that proposals from private parties,
contractors for such construction, art; asked for, and
(hat when these arc at hand. the Supervisors will con^
sidcr the ways and means for securing the sum neces
sary to construct and install the system.
The people, by adopting the new charter and in the
several elections incident to 3nd following that act,
have seemed to indorse municipal ownership of pub
lic utilities, not once, but repeatedly.
. Heretofore such ownership has been limited by its
advocates to what are called natural monopolies,
such as supply the necessaries of- existence, as water
and light.
The extension of the system to telephones, street
cars and like utilities projects it beyond its original
scope. All people have' to use water and light, but
all people do not have to use street cars and tele
phones.
But in some form all people have to pay taxes.
The man who rents a house is a taxpayer through his
rent. Â¦
If we have a municipal telephone system its acquisi
tion cuts two ways into the taxpayer. The money to
acquire it â and a 50,000 subscriber system will cost a
large amountâ must- be contributed by the taxpayers.
It is their contribution of so much dead capital. I(
the system displace an equal value of corporate prop
erty a telephone system the contribution of the
taxpayers is doubled, since they must not only give
the money to create the municipal system, which will
be non-taxable property, but they must make good
the taxation lost on the system which is
displaced. It will be s,een that the taxpayers are
really contributing the value of both systems, the one
created and the one obÂ«oleted.
It must be remembered, too, that this is to secure
to municipal ownership, at the expense of all the tax
payers, a utility that only a part of the taxpayers will
use, or need to use. All use water and light; only a
part use the telephone. Grant that the use will be
cheapened to those who require it, the economy they
will enjoy is at the expense of the whole body of tax
payers. In effect the property of the many who pay
taxes will be taken without compensation for the
benefit of the few who use the telephone. Under the
proposed system one-sixth of our present population
is to be accommodated by- 1 a municipal telephone at
cheaper rates, at the expense of the five-sixths who
will not use the telephone and do not require it.
Turning to another prospect that inheres in the
plan â the quality of the service to be renderedâ there
may well be doubts of its. efficiency or its improve
ment upon what we have. The existing service is far
from satisfactory, but no farther than any service tint*
is rendered by Government.
The city government cannot keep the streets clean,
nor properly sprinkled. It cannot make a satisfac
tory and sanitary disposition of the daily waste and
offal, required by our population. It does not prop
erly pave nor thoroughly light our streets. It is the
constant subject of criticism for its shortcomings in
all of these respects and in others which we have not
enumerated.
What assurance have we, then, Jhat the extension
of its operations to the administration of a telephone
system will supply a satisfactory service? The law
which appears in all Government activities is that the
more these activities are multiplied the weaker is the
administration. In what seems to-be its natural
place, government was intended to do a few things
which are beyond the capacity of the individual.
These few collective activities are mostly embraced
within the exercise of police powers. These cover
sanitation, keeping the peace, protection of person
and property. Government being designed for these
purposes and to exercise these powers, is not made
stronger for their administration by compelling it to
run telephones and street cars, or invade at any point
the field naturally dedicated to individual activity.
It is a matter of common observation that when a
business man dilutes his attention by diverting it to
too many things, differing from each other, he fails.
The common saying is that he has got his feet too
wide apart, and soon he splits from chine to chin.
There is no sorcery that protects government from
the same fate, if it embark upon Hke v diversity of ad
venture.

A CIRCULAR letter issued by the League of
National Associations sets forth certain state
ments concerning the Senate Committee on
Interstate Commerce, which reflect .severely upon a
majority of the members of the committee, and com
iug as they do from a reliabla source, are too impor

of the largest national associations in the country, has
been engaged in urging the passage of the Cullom bill
amending the interstate commerce act in a manner
desired by the Interstate Commission itself and by
the leading industrial and commercial organizations
of the Union. With the proposed amendment the
public is fairly familiar, its object being to clothe
the commission with authority and power to act ef

The Supreme Court has rendered an Im
portant Â¦ decision upon ; tha matter, of the
township and municipal boundaries of
the city of Santa Barbara, It was in the
habeas corpus case of Michael C. Dolan,
who was convicted in a Justice's Court of
a minor . misdemeanor. In his application
he took. the position that under the city
charter the police have exclusive juris
diction over such matters ; and : that the
Justice's Court conviction was void. The
Supreme' Court finds that the boundaries
of the township and the Â¦ municipality > of
Santa Barbara are the same and that
under the charter and the constitution
both courts v have -concurrent jurisdiction
over misdemeanor cases. Dolan, was re
manded.
Santa Barbara Boundaries.
Mrsi Theresa Bell has won her first de
cisive victory in her effort to gain control
of the estate of her husband, the late
Thomas Bell. a reputed millionaire.
"Whether ' the allegations of the estate's
creditors that the estate is Insolvent are
true or, whether.'as Mrs. Bell contends, it
is solvent and that much of value can be
yet dragged. from, the. seeming wreck will
soon be determined. /;.
Judge Coffey made an order yesterday
removing George Staacke as executor of
the dead millionaire's will, and he will be
forcedto step down and out. In his opin
ion Judge Coffey said that the charges of
neglect and mismanagement made by Mrs.
Bell were substantiated by the evidence
introduced during the hearing of the case
and without reference to the charges of
fraud constitute sufficient grounds to war
rant his removal.
Mrs. Bell is now acting as special ad
ministratrix of her husband's estate, and
will doubtless make application for reg
ular letters of . administration. Staacke,
it is said; will appeal the case to the Su
preme Court," hoping to be reinstated, but
in the interim, Mrs. Bell will, with the
assistance of counsel , ' endeavor to devise
ways and means by which something can
be saved out of the wreck for herself and
children. . Â¦
Since the strange death of Thomas Bell
In the ("House of Mystery" several years
ago, incessant litigation has been the' lot
of those to whom he willed his fortune.
For years a stalwart negress, "Mammy"
Pleasants.i guarded the portals. of the Bell
mansion and each day drove from the door
an increasing host of creditors. This
shrewd 'and aged "Mammy" ruled the
home of her mistress with a rod of iron,
until lately.- when Mrs. Bell, shaking off
the lethargy that has caused so much loss
to her, thrust "Mammy" out Into the
street and opened the battle to recover her
lost fortune. -
The removal of George Staacke was the
first effort* she made. In a document that
set forth a detailed history of his manage
ment of the estate since the death of her
husband she charged him with misman
agement and neglect and also alleged that
he had * entered into conspiracies with
divers persons to Injure the estate for his
own benefit. Judge Coffey has decided that
the first two charges were based on fact
and Staacke has been deposed.

he was a broker and was sending men to

small loans from friends, but denied that
he tried to borrow ten cents from Collis

Huntington paid him hundreds of dollars
through Steve Gage. Judge Treadwell ap
peared for Smith and said he did so to pay
oft a campaign debt. The Judge reserved
his decision until to-day. ;-;â¢Â¦*

ponents of its principles were as follows:
"Its Contribution to Religious Thought and
Ideals," by Rev. Horatio Stebbins; -Its Ex
pression in Poetry and Hymnology," Rev. F. L.
Hosmer; "Its Record in Philanthropy and Re
form." C. A. Murdock; "The American Unitar
ian Association. Seventy-fifth Anniversary."
Hon. Horace Davis: "Our Work and the Claims
'Upon Us To-day," Rev. C. J. K. Jones.
Rev. .Horatio Stebbins delivered an elo
quent address. In part he said:
"Do you know what unitarlanism
means? Sometimes it is called a negation.
Xothing Is more false. It is an affirma
tion of the true nature of human nature,
of moral retribution. It is a denial of Cal
vinism, which is passing away rapidly. It
is a way of thinking, a habit of the mind,
and depends upon character, which is des
tiny. A man that has the fiber of heart
and mind is the man. We know the truth
Just in proportion as we ourselves are the
truth."
Rev. F. L. Hcfemer was the ' second
speaker. His subject waa poetry and
hymnology, as evolved by the Unitarians.
Succeeding him was C. A. Murdock. He
said in part:
"In attempting to briefly review what
the Unitarian movement has accom
plished in philanthropy and reform. It
must be said that no claim is made on be
half of the Unitarian church or Unita
rianlsm other than as they have influenced
Individual lives." Mr. Murdock then ex
pounded his theories from individual ex
amples. An address by Horace Davis and
one by C. K. Jones completed the day's
programme.
The conference continues to-day.
e=jr=aHE . sixteenth Bession of the Pacific
Unitarian Conference, held In Berke-
II ley, began active work yesterday
morning, when the meeting was
called to order by President Horace D,a
vis. After a short address, in which Pres
ident Davis spoke of the progress of Unl
tarianism on this coast during^ the last
fifty years, the preliminary business of
the conference was transacted.
Reports from the secretary and the
treasurer were read, showing a good
financial condition. The Pacific Unita
rian came up "for consideration and it
was decided to continue the paper, with
pledges of support. Representatives of
the various churches were called upon to
tell of their work and of the religious
conditions of their cities. At the conclu
sion of this business the following com
mittees were appointed:
Committee on credentialsâ Dr. T. L. El
liot of Portland. F. H. Knight of Santa
Barbara. C. N. Wyckoff of Berkeley. Com
mittee on organizationâ G. R, Dodson of
Alameda. H. B. Huntley of Seattle, J. C.
Brown of Berkeley. Committee on reso
lutionsâC. A. Murdock, Rev. F. S. Hos
mer of Berkeley, Lieutenant C. G. Cal
kins, U. S. N.
The afternoon session was well attended
by residents of Berkeley as well as local
representatives of the church. The sub
ject of discussion was "A Century of the
Unitarian Movement in America." The
different phases of the theme and the ex-
TltEV.fxt Fusion of the Grand. Lodge
of -California, Independent Order of
Oifi'.Kcliows,. will commence In the
ajs&embly hall of the Odd Fellows'
fcu'ldhiff in this city next Tuesday.
There Will be. in attendance, in addition
to the grand ofScers, 623 representatives
fresi 356 lodges, which have a member
ship of 27.700. It will, be one of the largest
representative bodies of Odd Fellows that
ever met In this State. Since the adjourn
ment of the last Grand Lodge there has
been & marked increase. in the finances of
the subordinate lodges, while the net sain
in membership has been neaxly 400.
Important lecrlF-lation will be the work
of the irrarid body.' One matter to come
up will be a proposition to give official
recognition to existir.fr boards of relief in
the State and to ajiy that may hereafter
bÂ« prg-anizeri.' A rather matter which will
be passed upon will be the requirement of
candidates to perfect themselves in the
work, of thi order before they can take
the se^oiid or third decrees.

BRYAN THE GUEST
AT A DOLLAR DINNER
DETROIT, Mich., May 2.â Tbe old
La rm-d -street Auditorium, the scene of
many a notable political feast, sheltered
lo-night a banquet which far eclipsed In i
point of number present any similar event
hitherto lieid In Michigan and none cer
lamly evÂ»-r surpassed to-night's occasion
in rospect to party enthusiasm. The 12Ct
l>'atÂ«s laid in preparation tor the fourth!
iinnual banquet or "dollar dinner" of the !
Mohawk Democratic Club were quite in
adequate- to the number of men and |
wcfficn who held dinner tickets. Conse- !
<iuently eomÂ« of the tables in the rear I
if the nudltoriun v.ere served a second I
time. The galleries were filled with spec
tators.
As a matter of course the bright par
ticular sÂ«tar of tho evening was IJemoc
i aoy's diÂ£tlt:Kuished leader. Hon. William
Jennings Bryan. His name, as often as
it t'A\ from tho lips of the other speakers,
:.ll of whom preccdfni him. brought tre- I
jnendous salvos of applause. But the
other ppenkers did not lack the Inspira
tion of close attention and frequent de
m<-Tisirntirir.s of approval.
"The minority" was the toast assigned
Â¦.he first rpcaker, Hon. James Hamilton
1-rv.iK Â«if Washington. In the course of
his speech he said:
"It was the Democracy â the minority â
which lorced every act for which the
i hanging. .Kuplr.e Republican majority
!>ow asks reward from the- country. It
wa* the minorityâ the Democracyâ which
originated ei'cry good result which carat!
from the Repuhllcan administration."
"Democracy" was '.ho topic spoken to
l.y Colonel Bryan and the greeting he re
reived Â»e*rne<i almost boundless ln en
;huÂ»'usm. H'b address was devoted
wholly to the discussion of the three ques
tioÂ£*-monÂ«y, trusts and imperlallam.

STOCKTON. May "2.â Stockton voted to
day on the issuance of bonds on seven

for the Issuance of bonds in the sum of
$52,000 to extend the sewer system. The
propositions defeated were for building

Â¦_?_ â
Without a Dissenting Vote the Laiety
Is Given the Same Rep- â¢
CHICAGO, May 2.â The pulpit and the
pew share equally ln the highest govern
mental body of the Methodist church.
Without a dissenting vote the General
Conference at the Auditorium to-day
ratified the action, of the annual confer
ence In extending equal representation to
the laity. The provisional delegates were
admitted without a contest.
Mrs. M. Y. McMahan withdrew her
claim to a seat in the conference rather
than jeopardise the status of her male
colleagues. The step taken makes the
Methodist church a democratic body; the
rule of the preacher passes with the
century. The episcopacy in the church
long since has been restricted to a, super
intendence without authority beyond the
placing of ministers and suggestions to'
the general and annual conferences. .
The ministers were more enthusiastlo
over the loss of their power than the lay
men over their additional power. There
were 15" provisional delegates elected to
till up the disparity ln their' proportional
representation. Only eighty-five, how
ever, responded to the rollcall following
their admission. The limited lay repre
sentation gave the pews 125 votes. Four
ministerial delegates were absent. As the
roll was made up- to-day there were 356
preachers and 236 laymen on tho regular
list. '

EQUAL POWER
It appears from "your letter that In your in
terview with Mr. Atkins, whom you knew to
be a newspaper correspondent, you spoke of a
fellow ' officer, your senior in rank, in a way
calculated to bring him Into,- contempt. You
knew this to be a violation of the naval
reflations, which forbid the communication
by interviews of such comment and criticism.
You knew it to be against the good order an-i
discipline of the (service, brcause It is the
example of. an officer In hltjh rank reflecting
upon the honor and character of another â an
example which, unrebuked and followed, -tendis
to bring the whole Bervice Into contention and
scandal. You knew that the professional busi
ness of your interviewer is to collect material
for publication.
"While he may not have been justified In pub
lishing what you understood and regarded as
understood by him to be private conversation,
you knew the risk you ran. and within a yeai
had lie^n reprimanded for similar misconduct'
in putting, yourself and the, welfare of the
service to the Sam? risk with the same result.
Yon have thus again and further Impaired the
confidence of . the department In your dlscre-'
tlon. It is true that your case differs from
some recnt canes of offense on the part of
other officers In . that objectionable remarks
made by them were made on occasions and
under circumstances which they knew assured
their publicity. In your case the department
unreservedly accepts your statement that your
remarks were "in no sense and In no part In
tended for publication nor consideration as an
interview." It Is for this reason that .It takes
no other action than this 'emphatic reprimand,
thÂ» receipt of which you will acknowledge.
Very respectfully,
JOHN' P. I/1KG. Secretary-
The department regrets that 1t has occasion
to- reprimand an officer of your rank and ex
perience for Inexcusable Indiscretion and
offense ai?a4nst tho navy regulations.
Secretary Long In his letter says
The conversation was entirety. . private, so
regarded by me> and-. also, I; supposed,' by .Mr'.
Atkins., as -evidence 'of which latter <Â¦ the fact
that' .he. knew-: that my note was .private and
also' that, nearly or .quite a week passed before
he mentioned any conversation publicly. It
was in no senFe and ln no part intended for
publication -nor considered an. interview...
I tald the. question upon which the navy
stood was not the advancement of .. any par
ticular nrnn,. but one of honor. I added that
the whole difficulty ln the matter was- with
the press ln general, which hail failed to put
before the country the facts, bared upon Rear
Admiral Schley' s owii signals anil dispatches,
stated in Â¦ the letter of the Secretary . of the
Navy to the â¢ Senate of the 6th of February.
1S9S, and that the people In general were thus
ignorant of the- true status of the- case;, that
the Secretary.'s letter.- which, of course, was
virtually the "President's statement of the. mat
ter, \vaÂ» as severe an â¢ arraignment as It was
possible ' to "make regarding an officer, and
accused' him of conduct such that no. officer,
should remain silent under . the accusations;
that every sentiment of military, honor de
manded that Admiral Schley. should ask for
a court to clear himself of such charges, and
that I believed, every officer of the navy would
be- meet- pleased to see him. cleared for the
honor of" the service,- and that 1 could certainly
pay si) for myself, but that so .lonir. as he re
mained silent under these, charges 1 would
not takl his hand or meet him socially'. â¢ â¢. â¢
WASHINGTON. ,May '.-Secretary
Long to-day made public the correspond
ence which has- taken place between the
Navy Department and Captain Chadwick
respecting the published interview in
which the captain is reported as severely
rellecting upon Rear Admiral Schley. The
Secretary's letter was written to-day and
was forwarded only after the Secretary
had a conference with the President on
the subject. The department's action in
the case Is a severe reprimand, and it is
noteworthy that its letter has been made
public, a fact which in itself adds to the
weight of the punishment administered.
Tho correspondence consists of two let
ters, one from Captain Chadwick and the
other from Secretary Long. In his letter

paper says the Sultan has gone to Sing

a violation of the treaty of 1877 between
Spain, Groat Hritain and Germany, Ger
many guaranteeing the Sulu Islands free

of tobacco, rice and the Sulu staples of

The American garrison at Catubig,
Island of Samar. consisting of thirty men

been attacked by rebels.
Twenty of the Americans were killed.
The remainder were rescued.
The Americans were quartered In the

bering several hundred men. surrounded
| and fiercely attacked. The Americans
fought for two days and then the rebels
managed to Ignite the roof of the church
and it burned away and finally fell upon
those Inside the edifice. The walls re
j malned Jntact, however, and were used
as a shelter by the besieged Americans
for three days longer, the enemy attack
ing the building on all sides at once.
The Americans continued firing from
the windows and doors of the church and
| did good execution among the Filipinos.
It is estimated that over 200 of the lat
ter were killed, many dead bodies being
removed from the scene of the fighting.
After five days' resistance by the Ameri
cans a lieutenant and eighty men ar
rived from Labon and engaged the be-
Eiegers, who thereupon retired.
The fortunate arrival of these rein
forcements prevented the annihilation of
the American, force entrenched in the
' church who had repeatedly declined to
surrender when ordered.
The ten survivors were without food,
had little ammunition and were exhaust

This fight has encouraged the Filipinos,

SHE JILTED
CHICAGO. May 2.â While his wife- lay dying in a hospital. Robert Wayne, <
leading man of a theatrical stock company now playing in thi' city, was
Compelled through unavoidable stress of business to play his rote oi the young
lieutenant in the drama "Dewey. the Hero, of Manila." The audience little
suspected that the gay sprightliness in his portrayal of the character of the
romantic officer was but the mask of a grief that threatened to drive the
actor's Jiries from his memory and disorganize the presentation of the first
production of the play in Chicago. Â¦
' When Wavne entered his dressing room and bf>g:an making up for his part
ln the nighVs" performance he took with him the knowledge that there was
little hope of his wife's recovery, since she had undergone a serious opera
tion. Just t>efore the. ciirt.aln rang up the word came 'that she probably
would die before morning. The actor, unnerved by the news, was called upon
to face the problem of leaving and ruining tho performance, there being no un

NEW HAVEN. Conn., May .2.â The Uni
versity of California track and field team
arrived in New Haven this afternoon at
4:10 p.m. The long journey, across the
continent was at an end and the team,
weary of travel, was at. last able to rest.
At the station a party- of .Yale men met
the athletes and they were â¢ escorted to
the Yale campus. Here Yale's -manager,
George- Davis, took the team in -charge
and it was at once -sent out to the Yale
field for its first practice. ' :
Every man except Ca.dogan 'and Hoff
man went to the- cinder path and did
light work, but although the work' was
very light, being merely intended a,3'a
limbering up exercise, the results were
most' gratifying-. Despite the fact of be
ing, cooped up in a hat sleeper for five
days and nights; the boys got out 'for
their .first- exercise .and showed excellent
form. Plaw. especially, was In fine shape.
He hurled the- lt>-pound shot over '42}/ 2 feet
and then sent the heavy hammer a dis
tar.ee of 150 feet: : Champion Hammer
Thrower John C. T'lanagan,- who was
present, declared the work t>f Flaw was
unexcelled by any college man Ln the
country. Â¦ .
A .comparison' of the California team
with that of Yale is not practicable to
night, since but little of the Yale team's
work was witnessed to-day, but'the.Cali
fornia team feels that It haa every reason
to' be confident. â¢ Froni reliable sources It
has learned- considerable of Yale's proba
ble strength, and although this hearsay
credits, the blue, with better work than
any .the present California team has ac
complished, yet the blue and gold men
are convinced that they can equal the
showing- made by' the sons of old Ell.
Yale's field and track are considerably su
perior to that which the Western athletes
are accustomed'; besides, the warmth of
climate and. the. change of condition are
all jn their, favor.- â¢ . .- . '
To-morrow morning the team,' which is
at present stopping at the New Haven
House, will go out after breakfast for an
other turn at light work. Afterward will
come a bath, then a vigorous rubdown
and a hearty dinner. After dinner the
boys probably will be taken for a ride
about the country or else they will be
permitted to view the sights of the city,
as they may choose. On Friday the team
will take a complete rest in anticipation
of Saturday's work.

LOS ANGELES. May 2.â During a mo
ment ot uncontrolled fury and without a
second's warning' General 'Harrison Gray
OtisÂ«. editor and proprlotor of the Los
A-ngeles Time?, this afternoon assaulted
\Y. EL Ream, a well-known newspaper
man. The weapon used was a bayonet
saber. U Ir.chi-s lor.g. a relic of the Fili
pino campaign. Fortunately for General
Otis and Ream, it iva* not sharj>. ; The
bayonet cut through Ream's waistcoat at
thÂ«- waist line, a:id the force used was
mtBdeCt to cause a red mark to appear
upon the skin. Â¦' '-,
. Keara for a number of years was city
etjjror at the Times, but in the course of
events was deprived of tils position. Since
then he has D*-en persona non grata in
the- stone ca.n!e at nrst and Broadway,
lie is now a reporter on an evening paper.
The airect cause of the assault was an
encounter that Will E Chapin. an artist
Â«/l the Times, had al noon in a restaurant.
Chupi!: and Hush *v. Vail, a clubman
ar.d cattle owner, who some years a.go
married Edith Rising of Nevada City,
came to blows. Both took considerable
punishment. : .
Ke&m went to the Times office,: as a
reporter, to obtain Chapin's version of
the affair. When he entered the business
cilice General Otis and Artist Chapin
vore converging regarding the passage at
arms. With the appearance Of'.iKestn
Ut'.s lost his composure and began to heap
diusÂ«- upon the reporter. Â¦ -.
"You nave come ht-re to see Mr. Chapin
and write him up and lie in your usual
vela, as you do about everything else,"
he exclaimed. ' . Â¦ 'Â¦...Â¦
Â¦ Â¦ As Ream cid not reply the crossÂ«r of the
Rubicon grew more angry. â¢'Â¦: ..-'Â¦ '; Â¦' -â¢
"At that moment and without warning,"
R';.m said to-nisht, in describing: what
followod. "General Otis maue a lunge at
me with a bayojut saber about eignteen
inches iong. He was doing the talking; I
was waiting to interview Chapin. He
pulled the weapon from between the folds
of paper in which it was wrapped and the
ivisnt struck me on the left side of the ab
dfiEen. After he had stabbed at me 1 told
Central Oiis I was neither a coward nor
a. H;ij>ino general and straightened up
ar.a demanded that he make another stab.
At this- he fiercely yelled that if I lid not
have he would have his people put me out
ot the oflice. No other persons interfered
to smooth the ruffled feathers, and the
incident came to a close." . . â¢
Keam immediately crossed the street
a::d swore to a complaint before Justice
M rgiin charging General Otis with bat
j.-iy. General Otis called at the police
elation and pave himself up, entering a

The Spectator wan started as a distinct
ively literary periodical, and it adopted a
distinctly personal tone. Around "Mr.
Spectator" the Imaginary members
formed themselves into a club, and it was
their daily reflections and actions that
were to be imparted in a, tete-a-tete fash-
Ion to the public. This personal Intimacy
is the keynote of the literary tone of the
journal. This note Is struck with the very
first article on "The Spectator's Account
of Himself." and it is sounded in the sec
ond contribution whero Steele describes
"Sir Roger and the Club."
of the political struggles on the social
Ufa of the times. We know that party
spirit, yea hatred, ran high. Society was
actually at war. Tories attacked Whigs;
the established church, the dissenter; the
moderate Tory, the non-jurors, and the
Catholics were hated by all parties. Such
religious and political animosities caused
social divisions, and it was necessary for
something to step in and reason with and
ridicule such an impossible state of so
ciety. This was the Spectator. This all
needed something was the Sir Roger do
Coverley papers. Those papers served
the age of Queen Anne in that capacity;
they served all time In a much higher de
gree. They contained the germs, kindly
germs, of the novel of the eighteenth
century.

attracting an unusual amount of inter

tickets being greater than for any previ

no doubt to the fact that the mountains

winter rains having' developed a greater
amount of new foliage than ever before

TbP mistake is pometimes made of as
suming that Addison entertained no in
tense convictions because in his charac
ter of Spectator he wrote without inten
sity. Â¦*Â¦ But Addison had a higher art than
argumentation and intense diction by
which to effect his purposes. There had
been more than enough controversy on all
the subjects which Addison touched with
evident calmness in the Spectator. There
was need of a respite from fierce conten
tion,, and Addison's- prose came as a re
lief. The prose of the preceding century
Phows two extremes. That of scholars
like Milton, writing for - scholars, was
based on the Latin model and was char
acterized by long, involved and compre
hend ve - sentences. That of the journal
ists, whose â¢ number greatly increased to
ward the,close of the century, was coarse,
colloquial -and' intentionally slovenly. It
is, caricatured In the Tatler for Septem
ber 28. 1710. from which & sentence or two
will serve to Illustrate:
in the description of Sir Roger de Cover
ley, the typical country gentleman of the
time. In the portraits of Sir Rojcer
and the other members of the famous
club contemporary life Is pretty complete
ly described. Taine finds in these sketches
the beginning of the realistic novel
which appeared full-formed . before the
eighteenth century was half over. The
critical papers in the Spectator are char
acterized by great moderation of judjj
ment. the moral essays put forward a rea
sonable and cheerful view of duty, and the
influence of both is plainly to create a
Mntiment against narrowness and rancor
the discussion of subjects on which men
are likely to differ most strongly. It has
been said that Addison's greatest work
was a work of reconciliation. Macaulay
refers to this when he speaks of Addison
as "the great satirist who alone knew
how to -use ridicule without abusing it:
who. without inflicting a wound, effected
a great social reform. and ; who reconciled
wit and virtue after a long and disastrous
separation, during which- wit had been led
astray by profliKacy and virtue by fan
aticism." The Spectator did not speak in
denunciation of intolerance; it spread
abroad a spirit of urbanity and good hu
mor, instead. It created a. healthy and
sensible public oplr.ioirt on matters of re
ligion, literature and life.
This clings to the memory like the lines
of another hymn of his, written of the
stars:
Addison's work as an essayist appeared
In the Tatler. Spectator. Guardian and
Freeholder, periodicals which followed
one another in rapid succession during
the years from 1709 to 1716. The Spectator
contains his best work. The first number
was issued March 1, 1711, and the paper
appeared every weekday. It was eagerly
read at the clubs and coffee houses, as
well as in the homes*, and when the es
says were collected into volumes numer
ous editions were necessary to supply the
demand. ' Nearly one-half of the Specta
tor papers were written by Addison.
The variety of topics treated is very
great, but the professed purpose of all
the essays was to improve the public
taste, to make literature attractive, to in
struct while <?ntertaininK-. "to bring: phi
losophy out of closets and libraries to
dwell in clubs and coffee houses." Party
politics was excluded. The first Specta
tor says: "I r.ever espoused any party
wlth violence, i-nd am resolved to observe
an exact neutrality between Whlsrs and
Tories, unless I shall be forced to declare
myself by the hostilities of either side.
In short, I have acted in all the parts
of my life as n looker-on, which is the
character I intend to preserve in this
paper." The Spectator hoped "to banish
vice and ignorance out of the territories
of Great Britain:" it attacked with good
humored satire the minor vices and follies
of. the time and made them ridiculous.
To women readers the Spectator gave the
first hearty recognition accorded them in
the history of our literature. It brought
a new interest into their lives by its min
ute observations on manners and quiet
ridicule of extravagant fashions. Addi
son's humorous satire is seen at its best

Under a Judge excelled in all-round abil
ity by no other in the United Slates the
decisions of the first day of the show
were received with almost universal ap
plause. Mastiffs proved to be one of the
best classes of the breed ever seen here.
California Cube and Sharkey, who took
respectively the first in the limit and
open classes and the first In the novice
class, succeeded in achieving the first
and reserve in the winners. They were
rightiy paced, although the younger dog
Sharkey promises with a little develop
ment to excel his sire. Worthy of men
tion is Leo, second in the open, and Cae
sar, second in the limit. In the bitches,
the judge placed Cleopatra over Myra F.
The former certainly scores in breadth of
muzzle, but in symmetry of body is inr
ferior to Myra. St. Bernards were a
strong class, although they have been
stronger. Quality was very plentiful. In
the rough-coated, a very fine young dog
deserved the blue ribbon he received.
Orion L is one of the best rough-coated
do*?s the coast has -produced and in both
novice and limit was first, leading Mon
arch Bernard and Sir Robert Bruce.
Beat in the open dogs, King Crockett won
out. Monarch Bernard and California Cal
Eboracum giving him a close run for the
money. The winners' < lass was a fore
gone conclusion. . There was a block be
tween Orion li the winner, and King
Crockett, reserve, although it took a dog
of such excellence as Orion to beat King
Crockett. Sir Robert Bruce, the third in
both novice and limit claese?. is a mag
nificently headed dog with good markings
and will take a lot of beating next year.
The awards in the dog classes were sim
ply irreproachable.
In St. Bernard bitches the judge had a
very hard task, not as regards the first
prizes but the minor ones. Alta Rachel,
If she had ears slightly smaller, would be
the beau ideal of a St. Bernard. She
was practically alone in the classes In
which she was entered. , With a magnifi
cent head and a simple, beautiful expres
sion she was simply head and shoulders
over, competitors and deserved her . blue
ribbons in the limit and open classes. Of
course she won out in the winners and
was followed at a distance by Queen
Princest. reserve, who toon Second prize

rough-coated bitches, was the'puppy Zaza.
who promises to develop into almost as
good a bitch as Alta Rachel. The smooth
coated St. Bernards wore practically fore
gone conclusions. There was nothing to
touch Le Prince Jr.. who. of course, took
thÂ« winners' ribbon, but Falvo of Hauen-
Ftein might well have yielded place to
Bianca II. who is better in head and
markings.
The class of Great Danes was unusually
weak. In the dogs Ivan II beat Charles
D in the open and took the first winners'
with the same dog-as reserve. King R,
the first-prize winner of the novice class. 1
seemed to be smaller in his hindquarters
than the reserve winners, and might with
out injustice have beaten Charles Dfor
that place. In the bitches Queen R ran
a close race with Champion Juanita. and
there wa* very little to choose between
them. Queen Is larger and equally houndy
and wnll* Juanita may slightly excel, the
excellence of Queen fully Justifies the
award. ...
The Newfoundlands were represented
by one poor specimen, a bitch, that" was
amply rewarded with n third.
Russian wolfhounds also had one repre
sentative, a very fine young dog; Bullygo
viech. who would have won his first in hot
competition.
Two puppy deerhounds were shown,
both good over and one in the open class.
Jack, the father of the pups," is a little
better than either of them.* Two.hand
some greyhounds were shown; Sardonic
beating Twin City Girl in limit open and
winners.
In American foxhounds Will Kiltie's
"Mamma's" blue' eyes blazed and. cast
ing a withering glance on the offender
within, she carressed the injured four
footed babe in her arms, inquiring anx
iously, "Where did sister bite you?*
Doggie answered not. but General
Barnes, who stood by. said. "It is all
right." and "mamma" was satisfied.
Those who look to a dog show judge
for pointers as to dress are going to be
very disappointed in Mr. Mortimer of
New York. The metropolitan judge is
most businesslike, and there is not- the
slightest "sporty" effect in his bearing
or in his very businesslike suit of snuff
colored clothes. From the crown of his
filvered head to the heels of his polished
boots there is the suggestion of the man
who declares "what I say goes." And
Mortimer says the show la a success.
Judging at the Bench Show .
One kennel of "pets" yesterday nearly
gave a devoted "mamma" an attack of
heart failure when they had the poor
taste, to scratch and bark in true dot,
fashion. The ford "parent" who sat by
in a dreamy confusion of blue and white
foulard managed to retain enough pres
ence of mind in the midst of the alarm to
drag forth from out the flower-decked
bric-a-brac ornamented cages one of the
offenders.
THE dog show is a success. The. man- j
agers of the San Francisco Kennel
Club, who yesterday inaugurated the
fourth annual bench show in this
city, are pleased with it. and taken alto
gether there is general rejoicing because
the town is going to the dogs.
Thfi first day's attendance was more
than usually pood and the same holds for
the show, which ail dog fanciers arc
unanimous in declaring the best yet made
here. Society set its mark of approval
on the bow-wows early in the game and
beaux and belles and swell matrons pass- '
ed in a continual review before the blue
blooded canines.
Everything moved smoothly during the
day, and the only ripple to mar the con
tinual calm was the cheer that went up
when Bushnell stepped into the ring with
his smooth-coated St. Bernard and re
ceived from Judge Mortimer the tri-color
for his matchless Le Prince Jr.
There is more dignity to the show this
year than to the exhibit made in 1SD9. The
"pet dog" does not loom up half as well
and the show is all the better for it. The
woman's exhibit is easily spotted by rea
son of its adorning flowers and ribbons
and i-ilken cushions, but the majority of
spectators slip away from it and give
their attention to real doss of full grown
size. Every "pet dog" kennel has a
"mamma." anxiously sitting at its side,
cooing to "petsie" and stuffing it with dog
biscuits and bottled milk.
puppy distinguished himself by obtaining
reserves in the winners to that fine and
stanch hound Murderer. Judge Mortimer
was quite enthusiastic over the pup and
prophc-pied that another year's growth
would make him a formidable, competitor
in the hottest company that could be
brought together in the United States. In
bitches. Queen N, first in the limit class,
beat Belle, the first Jn the novice bitches
for the winners' ribbon, the latter bitch
taking- reserve. Both these are fine
bitches, though it may be questioned
whether Melba C, first in the open class,
could not have been awarded the winners*
I reserve.
The San Mateo Hunt Club showed a
kennel of eight magnificent English fox
hounds, all of which were placed by Judge
Mortimer in their proper order with un
erring accuracy.
The pointers proved the hardest class of
the day. By a curious coincidence the
committee on prizes had placed the
trophy offered by Vice President de Ruy
ter in that class, not knowing that that
gentleman intended to exhibit one of the
breed. Mr. de Ruyter's dog Plain Sam's
Son was fated to be the winner, and con
sequently he won his own trophy, very
much to his owner's disg-ust. The win was
the more meritorious, inasmuch as the
dog is a lightweight. Senator P, the re
serve, was the best of the heavy-weights,
and few judges could have discriminated
between the dogs as well as Mr. Morti
mer. In bitches a lightweight again won
out, followed by a heavy-weight as re
serve. Lady C, the winner, was llrst in
one open class and Kate, the reserve, was
first in the other. There was little to
choose between them, and either could
have been awarded the winners' ribbon
without Injustice to the other.
The list of prizes awarded to-day is ap
pended:

Addison and Steel* builded greater than
they .knew. It was certainly impossible
for those two essayists, from their point
of view, fully to understand thÂ« latent
forces centered In that new project about
to be issued in the columns of the Spec
tator. For our point of view wo can ercÂ«
plain why the Spectator was given to tha
world in March, 1711. We- can understand
why the half-century preceding the reign
of Queen Anne resulted In the great po
litical struggle between two radically op
posed parties, one desiring government
by constitutional methods, the other gov
ernment by an absolute monarch: and
why the periodical under such conditions
became a powerful weapon in the hands
of party leaders. We can also unravel
the social fabric and study the influence

GOLDEN AGES OF LITERATURE,
Addison s prose i3 free from scholasti
cism, but In becoming popular It remains
pure. It loses no dignity by its simplic
ity.
"In Addison's hands," gays tha historian
Green, "this popular writln/f became a part of
literature. While It preserved the free move
ment of the letter-writer, the *ayety and brisk
ness of chat.- It obeyed the laws of literary art
and was shaped and guided by a sense of lit
erary beauty. Its humor. too ; became a sub
tler and more exquisite thing 1 . Instead of th~
mere wit of the coffee house, men found them
selves Bmllin* with a humorist who camÂ«
nearer than any man before Or since to thÂ«
humor of Shakespeare. It was thus, that Addi
son became the typical representative of th<Â»
revolution which passed In his day over English
literature."

Joseph Addison was always his b*ad boy. Addi
son wrote his exercises. Addison did his best
themes. He ran on Addlson's messages; fasrged
for him and blacked his shoes; to be in Joe's
company was Dick's greatest pleasure, and he
took a sermon or caning from his monitor with
the most boundless reverence, acquiescence and
affection.

fellowship until 1711. During his univer

Montagu, afterward Earl of Halifax, by
indicating in poems that he wrote his ad
miration for Whig leaders and doctrines.
Montagu dissuaded him from entering the
church and induced 'him to fit himself for
statesmanship. Procuring a pension for
Addison, Montagu sent him to travel in
France, Italy and Holland. He remained
abroad three years studying political in
stitutions, meeting famous men of letters
and observing the manners and tastes of
the peoples he visited. The chief literary
results of his travels were a metrical let-

THE GOLDEN AGE OF ENGLISH PROSE.
The Independent IJght and Power Com
pany, through its general manager, A. I.I.
Hunt, submitted an offer to the city yes
terday to construct an electrical distrib
uting system for lighting public streets
and buildings fprjtha sum of 5225,000. The
offer will be taken up this evening by the
Board of Supervisors, which meets as a
committee of the whole. Representatives
of the various lighting concerns will bo
present.' It is certain that-other offers for
the system will be made. Jt is calculated
that the city lighting will cost less than
$170,000 per year when the system is in ope
ration, or about half v/hat it coats at the
present time. The first cost of the plant
is to be met out of the tax levy for the
next fiscal year. The letter of the com
pany follows:
SAX FRANCISCO, Cal.. April 3d, 1900.
To V?.r Honorable Mayor and Board of Super
visors of the <*ity ami County of San Fran
cisco â Gentlemen: At the request of the chair
man of tho Committee on l'ublic Utilities of
your honorable board we beg to -submit the fol
lowing . propoFal. contemplating- the construc
tion of iÂ»ole lines for the city:
We t. ill erwt, within the limits prescribed
by the ordinance of the Board of Supervl.oors
establishing a district within which wires shall
be placed underground, ISO iron poles, made ac
cording to blue print submitted herewith.
These poles to be set in concrete and painted
with metallic brown paint and to be located
as directed by you. There will ba no wires run
in connection with thesp poles.
We will- furthermore erect Dole lines cover
ing the district as outlined by A. M. Hunt on
a "Report on t!je cost of an electric plant for
llshtins' the streets and munlcir>al buildings
of San Francipco," dated March 20. 1S99, made
to the Board of Supervisors, exclusive of the
underground district above mentioned. Said
pole lines will be built on specifications as fol
lows: .
Poles to be square sawn redwood, forty feet
Ions 7x7 inches top. .12x12 inches butt. To be
dressed. chamDfered, roofed and painted with
two coats of Dalnt. All poles to be provided
with polÂ»; steyis. necessary crossarms, braces,
guy* and gained for a total of four crossarms.
Poles will be planted to a depth of not less
than six feet, where ground is soft, and not leas
than five feet where there is rock or hard pan.
Poles to be located as directed by you. and this
proposal contemplates placing 8300 poles. ' On
these Doles will be run circuits for connection
to arc lamps for lighting the streets. The
wires will be run on glas3 insulators, guar
anteed to Ftand a pressure of 10,000 volts. The
circuit will be run with the best quality of
triple-braided weather-proof copper wire of Xo.
6 B. & S. gauge and arranged In loops to carry
100 lights on each circuit. This proposal con
templates the stringing of 1.6CO.0OO feet cf wire,
and ends of circuits will be brought to any com
mon point designated by you.
Where lamps are to be placed we will erect
poles on diagonally opposite street corners, con
necting them with a wire Btrand. so that lamps
may be suspended ovÂ£r street intersection.
This proposal does not contemplate supplying
lamps or accessories, nor circuits for lighting
public bulldinsa.
We will erect poles and circuits as indicated
above for the sum of {225.000 IT. S?. gold coin.
If when location of poles and circuits is fin
ally determined the number of poles and feet
of wire is less than contemplated herein a
corresponding reduction in price will be made.
This proposal not to be binding upon the In
dependent Electric Light and Power Company
until it shall receive assurances satisfactory to
itself that the city has authority to execute a
contract covering the construction, and that
money for payment of the amount contemplated
herein will.be available on completion of the
work. Yours very truly.

COULDN'T KEEP IT.
Kept It Hid From. the Children.
"We cannot keep Grape- Nuts food in
the house. It goes so fast I have to. hide
it. because the children love it so. It is
just the food I have been looking for
ever so long: something that I do not
have to stop to prepare aid still is
nourishing. Wishing you all the suc-
cess you deserve." Y. Margcson,
Po Lincoln street, Winthrop. Mass.
Grape-Xyts i F the most scientifically
made food on the market. It is perfect-
ly and completely cooked at the factory
and can be served at an instant's no-
tice, either with rich cold cream or
with hot milk if a hot dish is desired.
When milk or water is used a little
sugar should be added, but when cold
cream is used alone the natural grape
sugar, which can be seen glistening on
the granules, is sufneicntly sweet to sat-
isfy the palate. This grape sugar is not
pourrd over the granules, as some peo-
ple think, but exudes from the granules
in the process of manufacture, when the
starch of the grains is changed from
starch to grape sugar by the process of
manufacture. This, in effect, is the first
act of digestion: therefore, Grape-Nuts
Food is predigested and is most per-
fectly assimilated by the very weakest
stomach.

NEW TORK. May 2â There were no transac
tions of any importance in the stock market
to-day. Sugar opened at last night's price
and moved up at one time 4>-i points, closing
with a net gain of about 4. The constant
fluctuations of this stock offered the room
tnideis about their only opportunity for secur
ing a turn during the greater part of the day
and they traded In it constantly in and out.
helping on the aggregate of Kales recorded In
the stock market without making any impres
sion on the stock transfer books of the com
pany. News of the Block -consisted of rumors
without veriflcatlon. There Is undoubtedly a
feeling of dread among speculators that there
may be a sudden and sensational development
regarding the steel industrials, and those
stocks are sensitive to every passing rumor.
They were all weak to-day. Tennessee Coal
dropping at one time 6 points: The rally in

larrely responsible for the decline and no very
large offerings M-ere brought out by the drui>.
Long Island moved up m on top of yetter
<**Â»"s 10>j rise and saved a net Rain of 6 points.
American Express gained 8 points. Outside of
these special movements the market generally
vaÂ« excessively dull. The announcement of
further gold cngscements for to-morrow's
French et earner of $2.l00.0wÂ» <ru the signal for
a general selling movement. It had been taken
for granted that large exjwrts of gold would
be ma.ie by Saturday's eteamer, but the ad
dLlcnal shipment by to-morrow's steamer
bringing the total to $2.CO0,OC0 was a surprise
This shipment is believed to represent a tri
angular operation; thst Is to say. on London's
order to meet a demand on that center Among
the exporters are wme who have strenuously
held that no profit could be made In ex
porting gold at the highest figures yet touched
for exchange, and the rule for demand sterling
to-day was >,ic in the pound lower than the
highest rate touched on the movement. It Is
lair to assume, therefore, that some conces
sion has been oflered to make a margin of
profit on the transaction; but In anv evnt
the metal is recognized as being in "effect a
loan. It Is evident that the need of money
here in. active trade has not kept pace with
the currency expansion. The low rate of monev
couplÂ«d mlth the large loans of New York
banks and their small surplus reflect the
eagerness of capital to place credits, but the
demand for credits Is not sufficient to absorb
the supply so capitalists must look abroad
where interact rates rule higher. This coun'
try's large gold production and the present
cutting off of the Transvaal gold supply makes
us the source of supply lor the money metal
The net nrsult 1h that we are n-;t only re
fraining from calling home merchandise cred
its, but are shipping out the money metal to
meet the needs of foreign markets.

and July ribs 174c depressed.
The rule limiting trade In futures on the
Board of Trade to sixty days went Into effect
; to-day.
The leading futures ranged as follows:
CHICAGO. May 2.â Considerations presented
at the beginning of the session In the wheat
pit were the strength of Liverpool, dry weather
in the central area and frosts tn sections of
the West and Southwest. The Liverpool
traders appeared t> to have concluded, as has
the bull party In Chicago, that Argentine ship
ments had i~>assed their weekly maximum and
that with only that country and America to
depend upon for seven-eighths of their wheat
until next September there was danger In
lowering their bids below the present level.
Brokers acting for elevator people were active
changingâ buying May and selling July at lÂ»ic
difference. May, therefore was relatively
stronger than July. July closed H@Vic up
and May gained U6?ic.
Corn wan flrjn, but not generally active, July
closing unchanged. '

Some Queer Looking Craft
That Will Sail for
Cape Nome.
Were to Have Been Towed North, but
No Steamer Being Available
They Have Been Bigged
as Schooners.
Chief Engineer Holmes - submitted his
plans yesterday for "the new fishermen's
wharf at North Beach. They were adopt
ed by the Board of Harbor Commission
ers.
A resolution that will come as a bomb
shell to the California Drydock Company
was introduced by Commissioner.. Herold.
Harbor Commissioners Meet.
Business between San Francisco and
Hawaii is picking up since the' plague
scare disappeared. The Australia sailed
for Honolulu yesterday with a good list
of cabin and steerage passengers and all
the cargo she could carry. Pilot "Newt"
Jordan took the vessel out. Among those
who went away on the Australia were;
D. L. Bartlett. Mrs. A. L. Bartlett, W. F.
Boardman, Mrs. Boaxdman. James Brown,
John Clemlshere, E. J. Duffey, F. Faxon
J. K. Fulton. George B. Grelg, Mrs. Grejg,
F. W. Hankey. L. Hinkel. Miss H. Keatiy
Miss Kopplkus. J. E. Miller, N. Ohlandt!
A. Samuel, Mrs. A, Waterhouse. Seymour
Waterhouse, Mrs. Waterhouse, Dr. George
Wegener, Mrs. O. G. Wilson and R. O.
Yardley.
mail Steamer Australia Sails.
The new craft belong to the Alaska
Commercial Company and will carry
freight to the gold fields. 1 , One of them Js
now loading at Beale-street wharf and
will sail in a few days. None of them
have as yet been named, but the chances
are that the one now loading will be chris
tened "Captain Blair." . %-."; 4 >
Tbe vessels were built by Matthew Tur
ner at Benlcia, and are 130 feet long by
32 feet beam. While loaded they will
probably draw about ten feet of water.
In order to get them to Cape Nomo a
peculiar rig has been adopted. They will
look like topsail schooners without bow
sprits and will carry "leg of mutton"
mainsails.
. A number of queer looking craft are to
Ball from here for Cape Nome. They were
originally built for barges and were in
tended for lighterage work. It was the
intention of their owners to tow them to
Cape York and there fit them out for
business, but a steamer to take them
north cannot be procured for love or
money. Everything that can float is in
the passenger and freight business and
nobody wants a tow.
It Instructs the chief engineer to make
the necessary soundings and formulate a
report In connection with ihe removal ot
the floating dock at the foot of Bryant
and Spear streets. The removal of this
dock to another'spot near the Arctic Oil
Works will give the Commissioners room
for two more wharves.
Plans and specifications, for the four new
wharves and the new ferry sllp3 to be
built between Union street and section 4
of the seawall will be submitted to the
commission next Wednesday. Ab soon aa
they have been adopted the work of con
struction will begin.
The Santa Fe Wreck.
Water Front Notes.
Two of the cars that went down in the
wreck on the Santa Fe line at Main-street
wharf early Tuesday morning have been,
recovered. The engine and one car are
still at the bottom of the bay. The engine
is gradually settling into the mud. and in.
spite of their best efforts the wreckers
could not make fast to it yesterday. The
removing of the box car attached to the
engine will not be a big Job, as it will
float when the couplings are cut and can
then be hauled ashore.
Officer John Dower will not forget In a
hurry his visit yesterday to Kelly's
saloon on East street. He went
into the place in all the glory
of his new uniform to quell a dis
turbance and was welcomed with a right
on the nose that nearly put him out. The
fighter was John Deaver. a sailor on the
hospital ship Missouri. When Dower got
through with him Deaver had to be taken
to the Harbor Hospital, where Dr. Cherry
dressed a number of lacerated wounds on
his scalp. After locking up his prisoner
Officer Dower went home for repairs.
Tim Sweeney, a fireman on the transport
1 Sheridan, was treated by Dr. Cherry at
the Harbor Hospital yesterday for
a number of lacerated wounds. He
was put to bed and held for ob
servation, as the doctor feared there
might be a fracture of the skull.
Sweeney says that First Assistant Engi
neer Mclntosh Jumped on him because he
asked for half a day's pay that was due
him. When he got the fireman down Mc
lntosh is supposed to have kicked him.
The engineer was arrested and booked for
an assault at the Harbor Police Station.
The Norwegian steamer Tyr sailed for
Vladivostok, and other Siberian ports,
yesterday with a cargo valued at $250,000.
The Mail Company s San Bias arrived
yesterday from Central American ports.
In a couple of weeks she will be followed
by the San Juan. Both vessels will be got
ready for next year's coffee crop.
The steamer Walla Walla arrived from
Puget Sound yesterday. She brought
forty-two. Japanese from Victoria. British
Columbia, and 164 more of the little brown
men from Seattle.
SAILOR FALLS INTO THE
BAY AND IS DROWNED
A sailor named Hogan, attached to the
army transport Logan, fell off the gang
plank as he was leaving the ship Penrose
Hill at 1:15 this morning and was drowned.
The body was not recovered.
LJU1<Â» Â«rood was accomplished by the
Mowing UP of Bhag Rook last Monday, ac
cording to the reports of those who sur
veyed the rock after the explosive had
done Its work. After the broken rock
hae been dredged out of the hole the pln-
Inacle v/111 still be but fourteen feet below
the surface at low water. The contract
provided ihat she rock be blasted to a
<3e*pth of SO feet at low water.
The pilots express themselves as dis
pu?ted with the whole proposition. They
tay that before the blowing up of the
rock, while it was always a menace to
navigation, they could at least see it and
knew how to avoid it. Now they will
have to pro by other bearings, and will
have to depend on their previous knowl
edge of the locality. Xo doubt the Gov
Â¦emmTit will anchor a buoy there, but a
buoy is not always a stationary object,
for it may be torn from its mooring* by
wind and lide. It is not yet known what
action the Government will take In the
nsatter. but if iÂ« acts as leisurely as it
tul9 done in the rast with such matters
ghag Ro'k will remain a menace to the
navigation of the harbor for some years
to come.

her sister, the maid of honor, and Miss

her. The bridesmaids. Miss Ethel Valen

Fore. Miss Charlotte Laws, Miss Jean
Hush and Miss Enid Williams, having en
tered from the side aisles, came down
from the chancel to meet the bride, be
tween the ushers, who waited, three on
either side.
Miss Blancho Sharon wore white crepe
de chine, demi-trnine and trimmed with
lace. A small wreath of white roses rest
ed on her hair and she carried a bouquet
of Easter lilies. The flower girl was in
pink crepe, made in the empire style. She
carried pink rose petals, that were scat
tered before the bride. The bridesmaids
were dressed alike, in Xile green crepe,
deml-traino and made with lace panels
between accordion pleats. Yokes of white
lace and rose wreaths completed the cos
tume.
Rev. Robert Ritchie, rector of St.
Paul's, officiated. After the betrothaJ the
bridal party "marched down the aisle to
Mendelssohn's wedding march. The ush
ersâMessrs. Adolph Cheek, Claude Sha

Leimert and Wallace von Helmsâ walked
with the bridesmaids.
The bridal party and forty guests drove
to Piedmont to partake of the wedding
breakfast at the bride's home.
Mr. and Mrs. Allen received many ele
gant gifts, among them a number of large
checks, and congratulations from all over
the world. Among these were good wishes
from President McKinley. The breakfast
was served at 2 a'clock and later Mr. and
Mrs Allen left tkr Seattle. They will re

will reside in San Francisco and will ulti

OAKLAXD, May 2. â Xo function of
the year in Oakland has rivaled in
attendance, in Interest or in point
of fashion the wedding at St. Paul's
to-day of Miss Florence Sharon, daugh
ter of Hon. and Mrs. W. E. Sharon of
Piedmont, and Peter Coole Allen, the
violinist and composer. The edifice held
hundreds of the friends of the bride and
groom, who filled the auditorium and side
aisles and completed a veritable crush In
the front of the church, even to the top
steps of the balcony stairs. The promi
nent social position ot" Miss Sharon and
Mr. Allen, together wJth her delicate
beauty and accomplishments and his
Cleverness and popularity, drew the fash
ionables of both sides of the bay.
St. Paul's was in elaborate dress for
the affair and was a perfect setting for
tne ceremonv. Green and white was the
Bcheme, a suggestion of pink being given
bv the pink-lined wedding bells that
swung on either side down between the
pillars to the entrance. Festoons of
pittesporum above the arches culminated
over the altar In a chime of graduated
flower bells beneath green festoons. White
and pink hawthorn banked the chancel
and potted palms hid the choir stalls.
At 12 o'clock soft music from a string
orchestra announced the hour' of the ser
vice. As Miss Blanche Sharon, the maid
of honor, appeared at the wide central
doors a -double quartet of female voices
sang Lohengrin's "Bridal Chorus" and the
brifie and her attendants came forward.
Miss Sharon was the bride Ideal in her
gown of white crepe de chine, made demi
traine and accordion plaited. An over
dress and bodice of lace had seed pearls
for garniture. Satin baby ribbon fasten

coiffure with orange blossom*. She leaned
The literary gods must have loved
Haie's Magazine, for indeed it died
young. It may have died in the hope of
blessed immortality, but no epitaph at
testing that hope can be found.
In casting about for facts connected
with the existence of this meteoric maga
zine, which illuminated the world of lit
erature for "an instant, one can find many
subscribers whose faith prompted them to
pay a year's subscription in advance.
The Acme Printing Office, 27 Geary street,
where the magazine was published, can
be found, but the magazine Is no longer
published there. The office of publica
tion, if It exists, is unknown to sub
scribers and contributors.
Inquiry brings to light the proof that at
least one number was printed. It was the
Christmas number, December. 1899.
What the Christmas number con
tained was nothing compared to
what the Christmas number promised. It
is an inspiration, even at this late day,
to dwell upon the pages of December
promise and reflect what would have hap
pened in the world of letters and in the
realm of pictures if the whole promise of
illustrated magazine work had been ful
filled.
Two Inside pages of the precious Christ
mas number were devoted to announce
ments. Blanche Partington was pro
claimed editor. Jean Hazen and Eva
Crawford were heralded as associate edi
tors. These ladies are accomplished and
talented.
They are literary ladies and to some
extent the superior of their sisters. They
had faith In Hale and confidence in the
reading public of California. Their faith
in Hale has vanished, but their confidence
in the reading public yet remains. It is
highly creditable to Blanche Partington,
the editor, to note that she never de
serted her post of duty while a chance re
mained to save a duped subscriber or
comfort a despairing contributor. Her
faith in Hale and her devotion to the
cause of honest literature cost 'her 5500.
It was the old story. Some one else got
the money and she got the experience.
The losses of Jean Hazen and Eva Craw
ford cannot be definitely stated, but it is
sincerely hoped that the ladies have not
lost heart in the cause of literature on
this coast.
In the prospectus of Hale's Magazine
for 1900 Douglas White was billed as a
star of the third magnitude. Alice Rix
and Gertrude Partington were mentioned
in a paragraph of the prospectus preced
ing the one in which Mr. White was in
troduced. The galaxy of illustrators con
tained these stars:
William Keith. Adolph Methfessel. Gor
don Ross, Albertine Randall Whealan,
Maynard Dlxon. Gertrude Paxtington,
Robert Kdgren. Louise A. Keeler. Henry
Xappenbach, Arthur F. Matthews, Mi
riam Weeks. Richard L. Partington, Rod
ney Thompson, Theodora Genung and
Donna Preble.
The brilliant page of the magazine was
the one that, heralded the contributors to
Hale's Magazine for 1900. It will be ob
served by the discriminating student that
one of these contributors was born great,
that two of them had greatness thrust
upon them by marriage and that the
others are in the field willing to achieve
greatness. As the prospectus truly says,
it is "hard to individualize," hence The
Call republishes the whole list. Here It Is:

It may refresh the reading public to as
certain the names of those who contrib
uted to the sole surviving number of
Hale's Magazine. W. C. Morrow held the
post of honor. Alice Prescott Smith took
second place. â¢ She began her story of
"Kim Lung, Humorl9t," by this positive
assertion: "Dawn comes slowly In <the
California redwoods." The best authority
on dawns and the oldest rounders of the
redwoods Immediately disputed the state
ment. The charm and literary graces of
the contribution were lost sight of In the
controversy about the slow coming of the
dawn. All children of the forest know
that the "dawning Is so different" In the
redwoods, that no one can tell In ad
vance whether it will come slowly or
break In suddenly. The magazine, how
ever, suspended publication and left the
Issue In suspense.
And what has become of Cory Hale,
who founded, inspired and wrecked the
magazine? The ingenious subscriber who
paid a year in advance may be gratified
to learn that Hale Is still of the earth,
earthy. The angels have not called for
him. although the gods did yank away his
magazine, with all Its wealth and splen
dor of promised literary contribution. At
last accounts Hale was at 310 Pine street.
He was collecting " data concerning the
world's production of coffee and rubber.
His friends aver that the aim of his life
Is to acquire money,, to liquidate obliga

of money refunded to them, but all of thlo

ner may cry their eyes out, but tears will
avail naught.
Cory Hale may have other schemes to
captivate and allure the innocent, hence
the investing public should study his next
prospectus with a vigilant eye. As far
as The Call can ascertain the ladies who
worked so faithfully to tloat the magazine
have no desire to brand him as a faker
or swindler, but they have no confidence
in his judgment and apprehend that he
may spread another net to capture the
unsuspectinp. Hale's veracity Is called in
question. He told one of his associates
in the magazine enterprise that he was the
possessor of $10,000. It appears now that
he did not have a dollar.
Markham, the man with the hoe, was
convinced that Hale was the man with the
dough. The poet was so enthusiastic In
the magazine enterprise that he sub
scribed for $500 worth of stock. The rec
ord does not show that he paid any money
on the subscription, but he gave his
poetic and moral support to the scheme.

G. W. Monteith and W. E. Walker adopt
ed the following resolution:
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1113 Broadway, May 2.
AN amicable solution was reached
late this evening between the Par
dee and Reed forces, and the en
tire situation as far as the Repub
lican party of Alameda County is con
cerned has been settled. The compromise
was the outcome of a conference between
gentlemen representing each side of the
contestants for delegate at large to the
national convention, and George W. Reed
finally agreed to withdraw his candidacy
for delegate at large and accept the posi
tion of delegate from the Third Congres
sional District. He will also be named as
the chairman of the Third District Con
vention at Sacramento and will be per
mitted to name the State Central Com
mittee from Alameda County.
It is understood that this compromise
does not go beyond the mere matter of
delegate to the national convention, and
that It will not extend to and has no ref
erence to the Congressional situation in
this district. It was decided that the prize
to be gained hardly Justified the struggle
that would be involved or the possible
rupture in the party. There was no money
in the Congressional committee for an
expensive primary, and there was noth
ing at issue that would induce. the candi
dates to put up very much money for
such a primary, and for that reason har
mony was decided upon. â¢;v-
' Dr. George C. Pardee has never admit
ted publicly that he was a candidate, and
when questioned has always said that he
had not announced his candidacy, but it
has been recognized that he would prob
ably seek the honor when the time came,
nnd the compromise of this evening will
probably bring his announcement.
This leaves the Congressional situation
just aa It has been for some time. Con
gressman Victor H. Metcalf is an ac
knowledged candidate to succeed himself,
but Henry P. Dalton has refused to say
whether he was or was not a candidate
against Mr. Metcalf. While he has not
acknowledged his candidacy he has been
doing all of the work that would accom
pany such an ambition. The Republicans!
of the Third Congressional District are to
be congratulated upon this pleasant ter
mination of what promised to be a bitter
contest.

PARDEE AND REED
BURY THE HATCHET
declared simply that the visit was "un
wise.
ihe only dissenting vote was that of
< hairman Gibbs. He protested that the
committee having heard all of the testi
mony was far better able to Judge of con
ditions, and he looked upon the amend
ment of the report he had signed as a slap
in the face. One of the chief reasons
which impelled Chairman Gibbs to make
the report that he did was the introduc
tion in evidence of a letter written by
Mrs. Hart to Rev. Mr. Smith. In which
occurred these words:
"1 hold the key to the situation. I was
always your friend. But now I am your
enemy."
The letter referred to the embarrass
ment caused the writer by the circum
stances attending Smith's visit to the
ranch during Miss Browning's stay there.
Speaking of hh; resignation President
Gibbs said: "I desire that there shall be
no rr.'.FunderstandinK concerning my posi
tion I resign fr^rn the church board, al
though 1 shall not withdraw from the de
nomination, for I was born and raised In
it Tlv report on Rev. Guy Smith was
made by men who had weighed every
Â¦crap (1 f evidence with great care. We
were tbe best judges as to what the report
should be."

THE action. of the First Christian
Qnuch in modifying the repoct of
its committee of lrivoprtisTf.'ion !n the

th? resignation of \V. T. CJilibs. who has

that hlS; resignation be aetod .upon next

sole reason "for his retirement from the
church board and his decision to withdraw
from that particular organization the fact
that the church d!d not adopt the com
mittee's report as.it was presented.
The special objection: he made was in
the substitution of the criticism of the
ri'Rt or's viFit to the Hart ranch at Prince
ton when Miss Mary lirowning was there
as a guest. The committee reported Its
belief that this Visit of Smith was "im
prudrm as a minister." The church

TRANS-ATLANTIC TRAVELERS
Furnished Special Attendants by the
Pennsylvania System. - t . '
The bureau of attendants for trans- Atlantic
travelers established In Jersey City and New
York City twenty years ago by the Pennayl-
vania System, has proven a great convenience
to persons making European trips and to
tourists arriving In America at that port. It
will be particularly convenient for visitors to
the Paris Exposition because the departure
docks of most of the Atlantic Steamship Lines
are convenient to the new Jersey City Passen-
ger Station of the Pennsylvania Railroad
Company.
This bureau consists of experienced agents
whose duties are to meet passengers arriving
In Jersey City and New York over the Penn-
sylvania Lines and assist them In arranging
for trans-Atlantic trips via any of the steam-
ship lines by conducting them to steamships
and aiding in preparations for a {rip abroad.
These agents will provide cabs operated by
the Pennsylvania System and aid passengers
with their baggage. They arr fully posted on
matters pertaining to steamships leaving New
York, and arrangements can be made through
them for procuring steamship tickets In ad-
vance.
They* also meet incoming steamships to aid
travelers in shaping details for continuing
Journeys from New York over the Pennsyl-
vania Lines by furnishing tickets, arranging
for tbe transfer of baggage from steamship
docks after it has been passed by customs in-
spectors, and having the same checked through
to destination. They will reserve sleeping car
accommodations and relieve persons of the
foregoing details, making themselves useful aa
attendants and guides free of charge.

PERSONAL MENTION.
Collector Scored by a Judge.
Attorney Forbes, representing Eddie
Conroy, co'.nplained to Judge Cabaniss
yesterday morning that Thomas Mulligan,
a collector of bad debts, was constantly
annoying Conroy by calling at his house
and dunning him on the street. Mulligan
was. outside the court and the Judge sent
an officer to bring him in. The Judge se
verely lectured him and told him that by
his persistent annoyance of Conroy he was
quired for the current expenses of the
municipal government for the next fiscal
year. The committee ls desirous of de
vising means for an appropriation of
$o00,0<j0 for public Improvements Instead
of the f220,o(HJ aJlowed by the Auditor.
This includes Reed's proposition of the
acquisition by the city of a distributing
system of public lighting.
A. S. Llllie of the Federation of Mission
Improvement Clubs stated that clubs of
nine districts had asked for $294,000 and
there were- four more to hear from. He
characterized the Board of Public Works
as an extravagant department, whose
funds are almost entirely consumed by
high salaries. ' '
The West of Castro Street Improvement
Club asked for a new schoolhouse at a
cost of 175,000 and for eight more lights In
the district. The Eureka Valley Improve
ment Club wanted $50,000 for a school
house and $5000 for an engine-house. The
Holly Park Improvement Club asked for
a few lights and the grading of streets.
G. Schnee said that money was being
thrown p.way on the Improvements of
Union square while school children in the
Mission are forced to sit three In a seat
at school. He asked for $60,000 for the
Noc Valley School, $47,500 for Sunnyside
School, $35,000 for the Berrerot School,
and $25,000 for the Monroe School; total,
$167,500. , â¢ Â¦
George D. Shadburne asked the com
mittee to segregate the St. Marys Park
fund of $125,000 from the general fund.
"We will need," said Shadburne, "some
of the money within thirty days after
judgment has been obtained, and the City
Attorney has advised that the money
must be used for the park only."
Action on all the propositions submitted
was postponed until the meeting to be
held this morning. Chairman Jennings
stated that he realized that the districts
mentioned are in need of Improvements,
but the question of appropriation rests
largely upon the amount of the assess
ment- roll, a view in which Supervisor
Hotaling concurred. â¢

Valley Water Works to retain In place

REVISING THE
ESTIMATES OF
EXPENDITURES
Johnny Kessack seems to be a boy mis
led in tho world rather than criminally
inclined. The statement that he had been
jailed was an unintentional error. He is
about 13 years of age and his worst fault
seems to be keeping bad company-
Mrs. Germer. who is also known by the
name of Ada de Ferreri. is still held in the
tanks. She Is about 19 years old. Her
father. G. B. de Ferrerl, ls a sign painter
on Powell street.
Mrs. Casassa says that when Wilson
and her sister left the house to look after j
the Kessack boy they quarreled on the
steps. Wilson had had some trouble with
"Bull" Erasmy and the woman seemed to
be keeping him from fighting. She
grasped him by the coat, but he tore him
self loose and jumped over the fence, leav
ing the garment behind him. Then Mrs.
Germer rushed out of the gate and noth
ing more occurred until the bandmaster's
wife heard two shots. Later Mrs. Germer
returned to say that "Poor Robert had
been murdered." Mrs. Casassa states that
Kessack came in soon afterward and
went to sleep on the floor.
The pistol which belonged to Wilson and
by which his life was taken was found
twenty-two feet from where the body lay
early yesterday morning. The ground on
which it lay had been searched over and
over again some hours before, but strange
to say it could, not be found. Two cham
bers had been discharged. How the gun
came to be so far away from the body can
not be explained. Miller says that the
body was almost cold when he reached it
and the character of the wound would in
dicate that the man had died Instantly.
An autopsy showed that the bullet had
ranged upward at an angle of 35 degrees
from the right side of the breast to the
left, entering the right side of the heart.
How the man could fire a shot into his
own body at an angle of -35 degrees up
ward without producing a powder mark
on his clothes is one of the circumstances
advanced against the suicide theory. Â¦.
On the person of Wilson wrfis found a
letter addressed to Miss Ivy Hawks, 149
Eighth avenue, and a girl with whom he
formally kept company. â¢ This girl, It is
said, was sent from the city about three
weeks ago.
Tillie Cuneo, about 10 years old, residing
on the corner of Thirteenth avenue and
Lake street, throws a great deal of light
on the tragedy. He says in part:
"Johnny Kessack was bringing me home
about 9 o'clock. Wilson and Mrs. Germer
followed us a short distance. When we
got to Seventeenth avenue we heard two
shots back at Nineteenth avenue, where
Wilson and the woman were. Johnny
wanted to go back, but I would not let
him, so he walked up to Thirteenth ave
nue .with me. I went into the house and
told the Erasmy family what had hap
pened. Kessack had a revolver, which he
snapped several times."
Principals in a Case That Is Perplexing the City's Detective Force.
When asked for an explanation, she
stated that Wilson had been murdered.
She paid she had heard but one shot and
had seen the flash, but did not state from
which direction -it came. She denied her
identity and averred that she was Mrs.
Casassa. Miller then searched for a pis
tol and went over the ground thoroughly,
but none could be found. After all this
Past this point all stories disagree. The
woman savs that Kessack was alone and
walking about half a block ahead of her
self and Wilson. She says she was fol
lowing the latter at a distance of four
feet when the shot was fired. She saw
no flash nor weapon, but when Wilson
dropped in the dust she embraced him
and called for help. Her statement is
also to the effect that young Kessack
was the first on the spot and rushed back
when he heard the report.
W. F. Miller of 1819 Lake street, In front
of whose house the tragedy occurred,
claims that he was the first to reach the
scene. He first went to the gate and saw
the woman bending over the remains. He
left for a few moments to procure a lan
tern. When he returned Mrs. Germer had
rushed to her home some distance off.
She came back soon, however, and fling
ing herself on the lifeless body once more
embraced It. â¢.'â¢'â¢;;:
Johnny Kessack and young Tillie Cu
neo started from the house together.
Young Kepsack was afraid of a man nam
ed "Bull" Erasmy and had taken a pistol
from a bureau drawer In the Casassa
household for his own protection. All
parties agree that it was not loaded. He
asked Wilson if he would accompany him
and see him safely on the way, and the
latter consented to do eo.
When Mr. Wilson came to the house last
night I asked him what kind of a day he had.
and he said lie had spent a very miserable one.
He took off his coat when he came In the
house, and when he went outside he was in
his shirt sleeves. He jumped over the gate
and I could not catch him then, but he kind
of stumbled when he Kit out of the Kate. I
ran a little ways and asked him to come back
and told him not to quarrel with Mr. Krasmy.
that if he did there would be trouble. I
Fcreamed when he shot himself. He told me
to go back and not follow him. I did not want
him to get Into trouble, and that was the reason
why I followed him. He ran down a vrays
after the boy* and then came hack again, and
between Nineteenth and Twentieth avenues the
fhootlnK occurred. I was not a bit Jealous of
him. as he wan pretty true in all he said to
tre. I am 19 years of age and was born in
this city.
he told me he could not help it as he had been
to the beach on a picnic with some people.
After that we were friends again, just as
thouph nothing- had happened. I "was not en
paped to thin man. He always said that he
thought a Kreat deal of me. I am married.
My husband has pone to Manila. He went last
January. Mr. Wilson had a very queer and
changeable disposition. He used to tell me
he ws a very jealous man.
EVIDENCE TENDS TO PROVE
THAT WILSON WAS MURDERED
A Deal of Mystery
Obscures Trag
edy of a Sol
dier's Ending.
Statement of a Woman,
the Only Witness, Is
Flatly Contradicted
toy Others Concerned
in the Case.
OUT on the desolate stretch of land
thtt kcparates Richmond from the
ocean Robert Z. Wilson, a sergeant
of tiÂ»e Sixth. United States Artil
lery, lost his life Tuesday night. But one
person. . a . women, . who lured the man
now dead from his post of duty and pos
6lbly to his doom, .was present when the
shot wai flrÂ»d that Beat a bullet into his
breast and pierced- his heart. Mystery
ehrouds the. entire affair and It ls deep
ened when, those cor.nocted with the case,
Attempting to explain away the suspi
cious circumstances, ta-ng!c their stories
in a. mass of. contradictions.
Two theories as to ihÂ«* cause of the trag
edy have been advanced to the police. One
that the sergeant having played his last
card In an unfortunate love affair ended
his existence; the uttur that he was the
victim of an assassin. His own pistol, a
stout &> caliber army weapon, was evi
dently used to tiro the fatal shot. The be
lief that Wilson's own tinper pulled the
trigger is taring- rapidly mssipated. and
the second theory, that of foul play, gains
creflet.ee as witness j.f:er witness relates
the happenings on the dark highway.
The story letks with the c^sence of de
bauchery exii degradation. Wilson, the
â¢woman and a th:rteen-yt.-ar-old lad, who
now lacpuish^s i:i the- tanks at th<* City
Prison with the woman, were all intoxi
cated the r.isht of the tragedy. The three
had spent an evening carousing together.
Frora the ruled accounts of the affair
the early portion of Friday night was
rnt bv \vnson in the home of Charles
Casa.Â«Â£2. the well-known bandmaster,
at 1S15 Lake street. He went there to
visit Mrs. William Gerir.er. sister of Mrs.
Casassa and wife of Private Germer,
Company H, Eighteenth United States In
fantry, now -n the Philippines. The man
ner of his errival is described in different
ways by Mrs. Casafsa and her s=on. The
former states that Johnny Kessack. a
neighbor's bojr.wbo flpures prominently so
In the case, brought him there, and l^ouis
Casassa. htr ton. claims the distinction
for that act of hospitality. After he had
been In the house a couple of hours Mrs.
Casaysa suggested to a l>oy named Tillio
Cuneo. who res-ides at Thirteenth avenue
and Lake street, that he hud better go
home as it was getting late. Johnny Kes
tack. who was ihOYlng the effects of the
li<juor be had consumed with the ser-
Btar.t and Mrs. Gormer. volunteered to
take the child to his doorstep and started
on th*Â» journey.
Previous to this it appears that Wilson
and Mrs. Gr-rmer had quarreled. The sol
dier had an appointment with the woman
at 1 o'clock la tfi<> afternoon which he
failed to keep. When he came to the
house it was only upon earnest solicita
tion and coaxing on the part of Mrs. Ger
nif-r.
The statement made by the woman yes
terday morning to Captain of Detectives
Seymour is as follows:
WV l-.ad all b*tn drinking at the house of

"I had just closed the market for the
night," remarked Hedberg when telling
the story of the robbery to the police,
"and started for my home. I had gone
only a few ieet when suddenly I was
startled by the command to throw up my
hands. Hurriedly turning around I found
myself confronted by the highwayman.
He covered me with a pistol and com
manded me to give him all the money I
had or take a chance on going to the
Morgue. I had $150 In one of my pockets
and $20 In another. I gave him the
twenty-dollar piece, and. concluding that
that was all the money I had. he ordered
me to skip. I did not lost any time in
obeying the -last command, as I feared
he would search me and find the rest of
my money. I don't think I would be able
to identify him' in case he ls arrested, as
his faco was closely concealed by a
mask." /
C. Hedberg, who conducts an oyster
house in the Foxhall Market, at 2918 Fill
more street, was held up and robbed
shortly before 1 o'clock "Wednesday morn-
Ing. Hedberg was leaving the market,
after having closed the gates, when he
was suddenly confronted by an armed
robber who ordered him to throw up his
hands under, penalty of being made a sub
ject for the Coroner. Realizing that the
fellow would not hesitate to shoot, Hed
berg readily complied with the demand.
"Shell out," commanded the desperado,
"and be quick about It."
Hedberg lost no time in reaching for his
purse, and taking out a $20 gold piece
handed it to the robber with the remark
that that was all the money he had.
"I expected to make a bigger haul." re
marked the masked man as he transferred
the money to his pocket, "but I could
have done worse under the circumstances.
Now get a move on and be careful that
you don't look around or I might be com
pelled to blow your head off."
Hedberg, glad to escape with his life,
lost no time in leaving the highwayman
and going to his home.
He reported the hold-up to Captain
Seymour, who detailed all his available
men to run down the highwayman. From
the cool manner in which the robber did
his work Seymour is satisfied that the
man is an experienced hand at the busi
ness.
Hedberg describes the fellow as being of
medium height. He wore a slouch hat
and a- dark suit of clothes. His face was
hidden behind a white mask.

Unsatisfied the footpad reached for" his
victim's watch. Thereupon Bortzmeyer
fell back a step, and without another
word the robber fired. The bullet took
effect in the young man's right side, pen
etrating his lungs.
A citizen residing in the vicinity heard
thp shot and found Bortzmeyer lying oil
the sidewalk. He was removed to the
Receiving Hospital, where Dr. Dray pro
nounced his wound fatal.
Bortzmeyer's strength was failing fast
when he reached the hospital, but he re
mained conscious and could talk with
difficulty. He asked Lieutenant of Police
Martin to telegraph to his sweetheart,
Miss Grace Hale, at San Diego.
Lieutenant Martin sent out a posse of
officers at once to try to round up the
robber. .They found a 32-caliber Smith &
Wesson revolver and a piece of black
cloth on the sidewalk within twenty feet
of the spot where Bortzmeyer was picked
up. but nc trace of,the murderous foot
pad. j
Fied Bortzmeyer, a young man who ar
rived here from Cleveland, Ohio, a tevf
days ago and has been living at 1323
Geary street, was shot and fatally wound
ed about 1 o'clock this morning by a lone
highwayman at the corner of Ellis and
Polk streets. He was able to give the po
lice a description of the robber, and it tal
lies closely with that of the man who ter
rorized the Western Addition last week.
Bortzmeyer had spent the evening down
town and missed the last car. He started
to walk out Kills street, and when at the
corner of Polk was accosted by a short
man wearing a mask, who present
ed a revolver and told him to throw up
his hands, lie did so, and in response to
a demand for his money gave the robber
$CO in cash.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL., THURSDAY, MAY 3, 1900.
"I went alone," he says, "and when I
had returned expected to find Wilson and
Adaâ that was the woman's given name â
there; but Mrs. Casassa said they had
Kone for a walk. At that time I had not
heard of the shooting, and, being sick
from milk and wine that I had drunk, lay
on the foot of HttliÂ« Louis Casassa's bed
and went to sleep, time afterward
1 was awakened by Mrs. Germer, who in
formed me that Wilson had been killed.
She asked me where the pistol I had
taken from the house was and I told her
it was on the dining-room table. She
could not find it there."
This statement is substantiated In part
by voting Casassa, who says that Johnny
did "make an early trip somewhere with
the woman. His claim that he did not
know of the crime until Mrs. Germer told
him at the house is denied hy Miller and
other parties. It is the opinion of the
police that the boy was so intoxicated he
scarcely remembers what happened. He
was beyond doubt some distance away
from the scene when the shot was fired.
When the Morgue deputies arrived they
found the body without coat or hat. A
bullet hole was In the breast. No powder
marks were on the body. They searchea
for a weapon, and being unable to' find
one awoke Kessack and Mrs. Germer ana
placed them under arrest. The first re
volver that was missed was the one which
Kessack had taken from the Casassa
home. He stated that after returning to
the house he had laid it on the table and
could not account for Its disappearance.
This gun was found yesterday morning
on Market street, near Fourteenth ave
nue, six blocks from the tragedy. The
supposition is that the youth in his intox
icated condition dropped it while taking
his friend home.
Johnny Kessack's story is the most puz
zling of the entire affair. Ho denies that
Wilson or the woman was taking him
home, but says that he went with the
woman on an errand earlier in the even
ing and that it was afterward that he
started to take young Cuneo home.
