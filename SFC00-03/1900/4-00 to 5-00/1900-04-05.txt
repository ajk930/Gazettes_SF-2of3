date If he had managed matters right
when .he . first returned to the United
States. He then declined to be considered
a candidate and subsequently dampened
enthusiasm for him by his marriage and
the transfer of his house. In the Judg
ment of politicians he has allowed his
opportunity to pass and cannot now hope
to secure a prize that he might have had
for the asking when he first came home
from Manila.
Whether politicians underestimate Ad
miral Dewey's strength with the people
of the country Is a question that can only
be answered when time enough has elaps
ed for the feeling throughout the country
to manifest Itself somewhat. There have
been Instances In American history when
politicians and party leaders have had
to give way to a. general manifestation of
the popular will, and the admiral and his
advisers have hoped that this would be
one of those occasions.
However this may be. it is certain that
the trend of opinion among politicians,
and especially among the supporters of
Bryan, is that the Dewey candidacy will
amount to very little. This was well illus
trated by the reply of Senator Jones of
Arkansas, chairman of the Democratic
National Committee, to my question as
to what he thought of the admiral's can
didacy: .j. , ?
"I have not given it any consideration,
paid the Senator. "It will be forgotten by
to-morrow night, so what is the use
thinking about It?"
When I asked the admiral this morning
IOMON, April 5, 5 a. m. â It looks to-d.17 as though, the Boers had conceived the audacious plan of â¢
A attempting to invest I.ord Roberts at Bloeinfomein, or at least to endeavor to delay his northward ad-
vanes by harassing the British lines of communication. On his side I.ord Roberts is concantrating his
forces and preparing to take every advantage of the bold but risky tactics of the enemy. He is not likely
to strike at cny cf their forcss until he is certain of delivering a crushing blow. Â¦ -
There is little doubt that Lord Roberts is hampered by the necessity for remounts and transports, and
the less of the convoy guns and all of Colonel BroadwcGd's baygage was a serious matter. The Boers are
now trusting to what they believe to be thf.ir superior mobility.

â¢-^HICO. April 4.â General John Bld
1 well, perhaps the oldest living Cali
1 fornla pioneer, died suddenly at his
\_jJ magnificent home ; on the Rancho
Chico at 2:30 'o'clock this afternoon.
General Bldwell had for several years
been superintending the work en a new
drive through his grounds, and went out
to Inspect the work this morning at 7:30
o'clock. At about 9 o'clock, while mark
ing_ a fallen tree for sawyers, he suddenly
dropped to the ground. He was conveyed
to his house and several physicians were
summoned to his bedside. At first he ral
lied and strong hopes were entertained
of his recovery, but at 2 o'clock fie had
a relapse, from which he never recovered.
Besides a widow, he leaves three nieces
and one cousin in this State to mourn his
loss.
In IS6BI in the city of Washington, he
was married to Miss Anna Kennedy.
His three nieces are: Mrs. Emery Hobart,
Mrs. Mary Reed of Chico anil .Mrs. W. C.
Collins of Sacramento. The cousin is Dr.
Ella Getchell of Chico. The date of tho
funeral has not as yet been decided upon.
General Bldwell was born August 5, ISIO,
in Chautauqua County. New York. HI-*
youthful life was full of change, very few
opportunities being presented him for edu
cational advancement. The principal and
last schooling he received was obtained
at Kingvllle Academy. Ashtabula County.
Ohio. He walked 300 miles to reach the
BRUBSELB. April 4â As the train
wat= leaving the northern station
for the southern railroad station, a
youth fired two phots from a re
volver at the Prince of Wales, but
miffed his Royal Highness.
The am-mpt upon th<- life of the Prince
of Wales occurred at 3:35 p. m. The
wouM-btt assassin jumped upon the foot

train was starting and tired Into the car.
Miming at the Prince of Wales. The as
sailant was Immediately arrested.
The would-be assassin Is a tinsmith
nair.ed Sipido. a resident of Brussels, J6
years old. His pockets were found to be
full of anarchistic literature.
When examined by the station officials
Eipido declared he intended to kill the
Prince of Wale? and that he did not re
gret his action and was ready to do It
again If given a chance.
Sipido subsequently paid he wanted to
kill the Prince "because he caused thou-
Fands of men to be slaughtered in South
Africa."
Hearing the shots the station master
rushed to the scene and knocked down
the would-be assassin's arm as he pre
pared to fire a third shot, and a number
of persons threw themselves on the
Prince's' assailant. ' In the' Confusion a
second man who was quite Innocent was
seized, roughly handled and beaten!

CHICAGO. April 4.â From early morning till nearly midnight the executive committee In charge of the prepara
tions to receive Admiral Dewey on the oc'caÂ«lon of his proposed visit to Chicago on May 1 was in session listening to
demands of angry contributor* of money for. the return of their contributions and to withdrawals of offers of a
score, or more of civic and other organizations to participate in. the proposed Dewey day parade.- As a result it Is con
sidered quite probable the Dewey day celebration may be called off.
When the committee was formed It was decided by the members of the finance committee, to whom was intrust
ed the work of collecting funds to meet expenses, that there was to be nothing of a political nature In the affair, but
that this occasion was to bo a patriotic celebration of one of the greatest naval battles in history: that Admiral
Dewey had kindly consented to lend his presence to the occasion, so that hundreds of thousands of admirers of the
hero of Manila Bay might look upon his features, grasp his hand and pay him homage.
The committee met splendid success up to this time. The people have felt the season was good for such an event
and the occasion would bring thousands-to Chicago. The fund which was raised for Admiral Dewey's entertainment
was in keeping with the city and occasion. Military and civic societies volunteered their services to make the display
such as had never been witnessed in Chicago before. .and .-"every. one felt the celebration would be as fitting to the ad
miral as had been the one in New York on his return from the Orient.
The committee was hurriedly called this morning to discuss the new phase put upon Dewey's standing before the
people by his announcement of his candidacy for the Presidency, and had barely been called to order when demands
for the return of contributions began to pour in by mail, by telegraph, by telephone and by word of mouth. The one
general excuse for the demand Invariably made was that the contribution had been made for the entertainment of
Dewey, the victorious admiral of the navy, and not for Dewey, the politician and office-seeker. The withdrawals of re
quests for positions in the parade by civic and military organizations were Invariably based upon the same grounds.
Members of the committee are facing one of the strangest propositions they have ever been called upon to solve.
They talked the matter over at length, and after a conference made the following statement to the press:
"The majority of the members of the committee find themselves In an embarrassing: position, owing to the fact that
they supposed they were to entertain the admiral of the United States navy, and now it develops they are to entertain
a candidate for the office of President of the- United States. This political feature has caused the embarrassment re
ferred to, and many of the organizations that were to participate in the parade have decided to withdraw.
j "Contributors to the fund to defray the expenses did so on the assurance of the'commlttee that there would be. no
politics whatever on the occasion, and now contributors are asking for a return of their money.
"It is hoped that the preparations for honoring Admiral Dewey will not have to be abandoned, and the committee
will do Its utmost to overcome the revulsion of feeling caused by the publication of Admiral Dewey's determination to
become a candidate for the"Presidency." . ' ;> . ' .-. ' : . , >- . *>;.C;',> .;;=t. Y.'^;
Notwithstanding the committee's public statement that preparations will continue, the members privately say they
believe the. "Jig la up." Many of the members have lost-heart, and If Admiral Dewey should change his mind, now that
he has become a candidate for office, and -decline to come to Chicago,; It would bea great relief to them.

pany. that furnished four-fifths of the j
lumber for the old building, has agreed
to duplicate the order at once at the rate
in existence two years ago. and the Min
neapolis firm tha: furnished the steel
girders for the immense roof has been
telegraphed to duplicate this order.
Flames Spread Rapidly
i lie tire started, as near a.s can ne
learned, at 1 o'clock this afternoon just
above the boiler room in the northea.-it
corner of the building, on the alley,
where some plumbers had hÂ«.-n at work.
There was no fire in the furnace and the
supposition is that the blaze started from
a spirit If mp used by one of the plumbers
or the crossing of an electric light wire.
A still alarm was rirst turned in. Fsy the
time the first engine arrived, ten
minutes later, the whole building was a
ma?s of flames. The entire structure,
covering half a block each way on Fif
teenth and Central ntr?ets. was a furnace
of fire before a second alarm could be
sounded, anil in less than half an hour
the roof, upheld by massive steel girders
that spanned its 200 feet of breadth, fell
with a crash that sent showers of burn
ing embers in every direction and drove
the fireman across the street. The brick
Corinthian columns lining thÂ»Â» building
along -the facades on Thirt.-renth and Cen
tral streets tottered a few . minutes and
fell outward and the hall was a complete
wreck.
A strong wind carried the flames to the
Second Presbvterlan Church, on the op
posite side of Thirteenth and Central
streets, and In forty minutes that struc
ture, occupying a half block in length,
was in ruins. The parsonage adjoining,
and next the I.athrop School, which was
partially destroyed in the cyclone of 15.5.8.
and which had been set aside for the use
of the newspaper correspondents during
the coming convention, were attacked
simultaneously, and soon nothing but
their wall* were left standing. For
tunately the school children had not re
turned to their rooms after the noon hour
and all were got to places of safety.
Next the flames caught the Williamson
fiat^ across the alley from the. hall on the
north, on Twelfth street, and these were
gutted. The fiats occupied a half block
and were of brick and three stories in
heisrbr.
Flying embers star'pd blazes on a dozen
different residences within a radius of two
blocks, and. fanned l>y a stiff breeze ami
aided by a low water pressure, threatened
a general conflagration. ThsÂ» fire, which
was- finally got under control ot 2:+>
o'clock, proved one of the quickest and
most dangerous experienced in Kansas
City for many years.
History of the Building
Convention Hnll had been classed by
travelers as one of the largest and most
perfectly constructed auditoriums In the
world. The building was erected In ls!>8

a piece of ground Ml by 2'>> feet in extent.
was two storir-si high and built of native
stone, cream brick and terra-cotta. The
first story was of the Renaissance style of
architecture anrl the second story in perl
style form, with groups and columns. Tho
building was of hridtre construction, with
out a column, the roof being supported hy
great steel girders. Its general seating
arrangement w;ts modeled somewhat upon
the plan of ihe Metropolitan Opera-hou?"
of N*w York. The floor space was divided
into ttrena. arena balcony, balcony an<l
roof ftarden. boxes skirting the arena and
the aÂ»ena balcony. Â¦
The total seating capacity was nearly 5\
fWX) and with standing room the building
was capable of holding more than 22.000
people. The arena alone seated 4"00. The.
building had no stairways, the upper
seating being reached by means of In
clined plants. Separate exitn were used for
the balconies and roof garden and it wa*
estimated that the hall could be emptied
Xt the rate of 50"O people a minute. Prac
tically nothing remains intact of Conven
tion Hall save the Thirteenth-street one
str.ry wall and the foundation. The strag
gling side walls will have to be torn down.
KANSAS CITY. Mo.. April 4.â Con- |
vention Hall. Kansas City's pride,
wherein the Democratic National
Convention was to have been held
on July 4, was laid In ruins in less
than thirty minutes' time this afternoon
from a tire that started from an unknown
source at 1 o'clock. The fire burned with
such fury that it was evident almost
from the start that the structure was
doomed and the firemen soon turned their
attention to saving surrounding property.
A stiff breeze was blowing and before the
tire was subdued at 2:15 o'clock the Sec
ond Presbyterian Church,, one of the
finest edifices in the city, the church par
sonage, the Lathrop public school, a two
story, thlrteen-room building, all situated
across the way on Central street, a half
block of three-story flat buildings on
Twelfth street, were rendered total losses.
Several residences were damaged to a
greater or less degree and for a time it
was feared that several blocks of build
ings In the residence district would so.
The aggregate loss is J400.0G0, ap
portioned as follows: Convention Hall.
J235.000. Insurance $13.1,000; church $50,000,
insured; parsonage $15,000. insured; schooi
$35,000. Insurance J20.400; Williamson block.
Twelfth street. $50,000, insurance $15,000;
miscellaneous $5000.
Will Be Rebuilt.
Plan's are on foot to rebuild Convention
Hall immediately and make It ready for
the Democratic convention In July. While
the fire was still in progress members of
the Commercial Club, through whose ef
forts the hall was conceived and built,
mingled in the crowds of spectators and
began soliciting funds for a new struct

LIXGTON HOTEL. WASHING
TON. April 4.â Admiral Dewry's
announcement of his candidacy for
the Presidency this morning has
been almost the sole topic of conversation
to-day unions' public men in Washington.
The announcement came as a complete
?surprise to all except the few politicians
who had teen using their influence with
the admiral for some time to induce him
to adopt this course.
Though Admiral Dewoy does not indi
cate in any way which party be expects
to take up hfs candidacy it Is stated tha*
', ho, expects that his announcement will
"create such a \vav*;*6f poÃiUav.ehtilushi^m
as to indicate . to" the leaders of the
Democracy the advisability of placing him
in nomination at the Kansas City con
vention. The men who are understood to
I have been consulted about the matter and
! who cave It more or less encouragement
are all Democrats who are opposed to th<?
nomination of Mr. Bryan. Among them
are said to be John R. McLean, the ad
miral's brother-in-law; former Secretary
of the Navy Whitney, former Senator
Gorman. Nathan Straus of New York aid
Judge Brawley of South Carolina.
There is pood reason to believe that
certain prominent Republicans are well
pleased with the admiral's action, even
if they did not urge it upon him in ad-
J vance. Some of tne Republicans who
I have opposed the Porto Rlcan tariff bill
i were hopeful th.Â« morning when they
I tend the announcement that it would re
j suit in frightening the Republican leaders
j and cause them to abandon their un
! popular policy. Senator Proctor of Ver-
I mont and Senator Allison of lowa are said
j to be two of the men who looked upon
j the announefment with favor and Senator
; Allison was or.c of the first callers at the
admiral's residence this morning.
Unless the effect of the admiral's an
j nouncemrnt outside of Washington has
i bren entirely different from what It has
' 1 Â«en here* it will utterly fail to arouse
| enough popular enthusiasm to carry th*
i hero of Manila into tl-.e White House.

this question was touched upon he begged
to be excused from any further statement

PRESS UNFAVORABLE TO
DEWEY'S CANDIDACY
NEW YORK, April 4.â Newspapers of
this city comment upon Dewey's candi
dacy as follows:
The Journal: This Is the time when the
people want leaders. When Dewey sailed
into Manila Bay ho knew precisely what
he was going to do. When the admiral
waa asked what his platform was he re
sponded, "Well, how would the American
flag do?" It would have done very well
a few months ago, but now according to
the new Republican doctrine It means one
thing In Porto Rico, another in Hawaii,
another in Idaho and another In tho Phil
ippines.
The World: If he is to be a candidate
with any hope of success it must be as
the nominee of the Democratic party.
President McKinley is as sure to bo re
nominated by the Republicans as the Bun
.is to rise. But â always the pregnant
"but"â where does Dewey stand? What is
he for? What is he against? And most
important of all, would Mr. Bryan, who
unquestionably controls the situation, and
will continue to do so, step aside and in
duce the Democratic party to accept him?
Has not Admiral Dewey waited too long?
The Sun: When Admiral Dewey last
fall said he was not and would not be a
candidate for President the face of .cir
cumstances favored continuation of that
state of mind. Then came his marriage and
the consequent subjection of all thoughts
and feelings and ambitions to another
influence. No one can be a Presidential
candidate in truth who does not first say
by which of the two great parties he desires
to be nominated, or, If either suits him,
what set of principles he believes In. Hut
anyway as a friend of Admiral Dewey we
are sorry for the episode.
The Tribune: The people woke up yes
terday to find they had a new candidate
for President, and when they asked on
what ticket he would run and what prin
ciples he would represent they found it
was a case of "no party, no platform
Just Dewey."
The Times: Admiral Dewey exhibits In
a most unusual degree the attractive
quality of simple, open-hearted frankness
In avowing his willingness to accept a
nomination for the Presidency. The
American people will like him all the bet
ter for that. .
The Press: Dewey is pretty pure to dis
cover a painfully cogent reason to re
shape his conclusion that "the office of
President Is not such a very difficult one
to fill." Indeed, that single sentence will,
we fear, give the admiral some reason for
regret.
CHICAGO. April 4.â Regarding Dewey's
candidacy for the Presidency, the Even
ing Journal <7nd. R.) says: Notwithstand
ing the widespread discontent with the
fonrttftnn of national politics, , we cannot
help feeling that Admiral Dewey's candi
dacy is inopportune and ill advised. The
admiral cannot hope, for nomination, at
the hands of either great party. There Is

WASHINGTON, April 4.â The Washing
ton Evening Star, regarding Dewey s
Presidential candidacy, declares both po
litical party candidates already selected
In McKinley and Bryan and says: There
is no sincere friend or admirer of Admiral
Dewey but will regret the announcement
which appears In print to-day by his au
thority. Admiral Dewey, for the first time
In his life, takes the field too late. The
battle virtually is on; the parties are lined
up; the leaders are chosen. There are
some discontented men In both parties;
but they are not numerous In either party,
and if it were possible to bring them all
together for co-operation they would not,
by virtue either of numbers or character,
be able to tempt any man of experience
or ability to accept their leadership. Ad
miral Dewey will presently find that he
Is yielding to influences which lead only
to disappointment and regret." A great
sailor should have a better chart In a
strange sea.
Washington Evening Times: The formal
announcement by Admiral Dewey that he
Is a candidate for the Presidency is the
most interesting political event of the
year. While coming at this time it is in
the nature of a surprise, there is no
doubt that the admiral has had the matter
in serious consideration for many months,
and only yields now to what he believes
to be an overwhelming public sentiment.
It is apparent that the admiral comes be
fore the people neither as a Democrat nor
Republican. In his opinion his services
have been rendered to the whole country
arid It must be the country itself which
shall call him to the White House. But
this raises a question of the greatest In
terest. Will he be nominated by the Re
publicans in June, by the Democrats In
July, or will he take the field as an In
dependent candidate In response to a
great public demand? In other words,
can he Â»defeat McKinley at Philadelphia
and Mr. Bryan at Kansas City, or, fail
ing to do either of these things, can he
defeat them both at the November elec
tion?
CINCINNATI. April 4.â Commercial
Tribune (R.): The admiral has reconsid
ered. Caesar did the same and received
the crown, but afterward he was knifed
in the house of his friends by Roman
politicians. History, which may repeat It
self In the first . parallel, will probably
mix matters a bit in the sequence. Dewey
will not receive the crown, but he will be
knifed by his pseudo friends, the Ameri
can politicians. And the knifing will pre
cede the bestowal of the frown. In the
matter of this Presidential nomination,
had Dewey but pursued the tactics that
marked his May morning victory In Manila
Bay, the results might have been as then.
But the tactics of Dewey in politics have
not been the tactics of, Dewey In war.
The results will be equally diverse.

ocratic organ in Kentucky): There Is not
much doubt Dewey as the Republican
nominee would defeat Bryan, and as the
Democratic standard bearer he would
easily triumph over McKinley. McLean's
machine could give him Ohio and the
Haldeman machine would be glad of the
chance to give him Kentucky if he should
develop a chance to win. With Dewey" in
the fight. Indiana and Illinois could not
be put down as safe for Bryan. If by
force of Dewey's popularity and shrewd
manipulation of the wires by politicians
a platform could be adopted upon which
Bryan could not accept the nomination,
Dewey is the only man to whom the party
could turn with the slightest hope of suc
cess.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, April 4.â The Press-
Post, a Democratic evening paper, came
out to-day in support of Dewey's candi
dacy for the Presidential nomination. The
paper has been a strong supporter of
Bryan, and immediately upon the an
nouncement of the change in policy Web
ster Huntington, the editor-in-chief, re
signed. Huntington said in explanation
of his action: ".,j. V i.
"It Is simply Impossible for me to be
connected with a newspaper that Is ready
to support Dewey for President and be
tray Bryan. It will be time enough for
me to support Dewey when he has proved
himself a Democrat and is nominated for
President on a Democratic platform, two

DOES NOT INTEND TO
RESIGN FROM NAVY
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, April 4.â Before an
nouncing' his candidacy for the Presi
dency, Admiral Dewey Investigated his
status in the navy In the event of his
election. I understand on high authority
that he has decided that he will not have
to resign his position in the service should
he be carried by a popular wave Into the
W'hlte House, nor by his acceptance of
the Presidential office will he vacate* his
commission of admiral of the navy, as
Grant did his position of general when he
assumed the Presidential office. Since
General Grant's time there has been an
amendment to the law on the subject.
But before his inauguration, in the event
of his election, Admiral Dewey proposes
to apply for retirement.
Considerable regret Is expressed In
naval circles at the announcement by
the admiral that he will be a candidate
tamed that the man who fired the shot
had been arrested he declared himself and
the Princess uninjured and the train
started.
Â¦The attack is condemned even at the
labor headquarters here and at the Malson
dv Peuple, where the extreme anarchists
meet. A leading member of the young
socialist guard was loud in his denuncia
tion this evening of Sipido'a actlcn. Le
Patriot in a special edition denounces the
attempt as "cowardly and senseless," and
says: "It will create general indignation,
and the worst enemy of Belgium could not
have dealt the country a fouler blow."
The Journal de Bruxelles says; "This
outrage will provoke the Indignation of all
honest people In every civilized country,
especially Belgium. We stigmatize it as
the crime of a youth of disordered brain.
We deeply regret that It was committed
In Belgium, and we congratulate the
Prince of Wales upon his fortunate escape
from the bullet of a regicide."
An eye-witness says that the train was
already in motion, and when the engineer
heard the pistol he shut off steam, ap
plied the brakes and stopped the train.
As the train restarted after Sipido's arrest
the public loudly cheered the Prince, who
acknowledged the demonstration from the
car window.
An examination of Slpldo's revolver
showed that four charges nad been fired,
but that two of the cartridges had missed
fire.
Sipido has a round, boyish face, black
eyes and dark hair. At the examination
before the magistrate it was ascertained
that he had purchased a penny ticket in
order to reach the departure platform,
where he walked up and down quite a
while at the same time the Prince was
promenading.
Persons who attended the Malson dv
Peuple yesterday say that they heard
Sipido declare that if the Prince of Wales
came to Brussels he ought to have a bul
let In his head, and they also heard him
offer to bet five francs that he would fire
at the Prince.
According to Le Patriot some news of
the views expressed at the meeting re
ferred to was conveyed to the station mas
ter, who had taken what he thought were
jextra precautions.
Slpido appeared at the station In his
best clothing, having explained to his
father that he was going to seek employ
ment.
The Prince of Wales appeared quite un
affected by the Incident. He asked
whether the revolver was loaded, and on
being Informed in the affirmative smiled
and begged that the culprit might not be
treated too severely.
La Chronique says: "Belgium should
not be held responsible for the act of a
madmfn. whose conduct she repudiates."
LONDON*. April 4.â The Prince and
Princess of 'Wales started for Copenhagen
this morning for the purpose of attending
the celebration of King Christian's birth
day, which occurs April S.
Â¦ The news of the attempt on the life of
the Prince of Wales spread with rapidity
in all parts of London and created the
most flitense excitement and bitter Indig
nation among all classes. The fact that
the attempted assassination occurred In a
city where Dr. Leyds. the diplomatic
agent of the Transvaal, has made hl3
headquarters was generally taken to In
dicate that the would-be assassin was a
Boer sympathizer and this so Inflamed the
passions that the most bitter Invectives
were hurled against the Boers and every
thing connected with them.
The Government was wholly Ignorant of
the attempt on the life of the Prince of
Wales until the press dispatches on the
subject were communicated to the For
eign Office.
The Marquis of Salisbury Immediately
telegraphed to the Prince of Wales his
congratulations on his escape, while the
United States Charge d'Affalres. Henry
D. White, who was calling- on the Pre
mier, promptly repaired to Marlborough
House and left his card there.
All the officials were greatly disturbed
by the occurrence and the general view
was that It must be connected In some
way with the Transvaal, especially as the
Prince of "Wales has always heretofore
been such a favorite on the Continent and
never before has been molested in the
slightest degTee.

for the Presidency. None of the officials
or naval officers on duty In the Navy De

to their views, but it is evident that they
think that the admiral has made a great

what he meant by "people's candidate,"
he replied that he had not tdenlfied him
self with either party and that he was
unwilllr.g at present to indicate any party
preferences and that he would wait to
hear from the people before making any
statements on public questions. The ad
miral frankly admitted that he had pur
posely made the announcement through
a paper which advocated his nomination
before he returned from Manila,
"I 'have every reason to believe," re
marked the admiral, "that there Is a
popular demand for my nomination. If
buch Is the case I am perfectly willing to
obey the orders of the American people,
just as I have done my superiors in the
navy. From every State in the Uniqn and
from all classes of people I have received
gratifying evidence of a desire for my
nomination. The demand has become so
general that 1 felt constrained to give
serious consideration to the matter, and
although I had previously stated that I
would not accept the nomination, the con
ditions have so changed in the past few
months that I cannot longer as a loyal
American citizen say that I would not
obey the will of the people If the decision
should be that I am a suitable candidate
for the Presidency."
"But, admiral," I remarked, "there In a
very natural desire to know something
about your platform and the party from
which you may expect the nomination."
"Oh, I cannot talk about that now," he
replied. "I am not a politician. I have
not any platform except the constitution
and the laws of Congress. It is for the
convention which may nominate me and
not for myself to make the platform. In
my opinion the office of President Is
wholly executive. It should not be the
policy of the President to dictate to Con
gress or to the people, but to faithfully
and conscientiously execute the laws
which Congress may exact for the benefit
of the people.
"1 fully realize that In announcing my
willingness to become a candidate my
troubles are beginning; but a man who
haa the Interest of his country at heart
cannot escape his share of them, and I am
willing to risk all that may come to me.
It is not my purpose to do any campaign
ing. I have simply announced my position
in order that people may know where I
stand. It is not true that the visits I have
planned for the West are for political pur
poses. They were decided upon long be
fore I reached the "conclusion to become a
candidate. In a few days I expect to go

Dr. Greenburg announces that while he
will not follow the old rabbinical custom,
he will preach the essence of Judaism
pure and simple. He will not wear a. hat
during the service, in obedience to an
Oriental custom, not based on divine law;
nor will he appear with silken cape or
shawl, as the ultra orthodox do at their
services.
Thus it will appear that there is not
likely to be a union of the extreme ortho
dox with the reform Jews. although a wel
come is offered to the former at the re
ception to the new rabbi to-morrow night.
Dr. Greenburg is a graduate of the
University of London. He received his
degree of Ph. D. at Heidelberg and is a
student of Hebrew, the Phoenician and
other ancient languages.
The reception to Rabbi Greenburg at
Y. M. C. A. Hall to-night, though informal
in character, proved very enjoyable. A
committee of ladies from the congrega
tion managed the event. The hall was-,
very prettily decorated with flowers and
looked very inviting. Albert Elkus, pres
ident of the Congregation B'nai Israel; 11.
Weinstock and L. Heilbron occupied seats
on th? platform with Rabb! Greenburg
and aided the ladles In intrcducing him
to the members of the congregation and
Invited guests. An excellent programme
of music was presented. A feature, of the
reception wa.s the presentation of solid
silver loving cups, suitably inscribed, to
H. Weinstock and L.. Heilbron on behalf
of the congregation and in recognition of
its appreciation of their services in filling
the pulpit of the synagogue during the
months when It was without a rabbi.
(~\ ACRAMEXTO, April 4.â Rabbi Wil-
L iam H. Greer.burg, Ph. D.. who is
to have charge of the Congregation
vl B'nai Israelin this city, has arrived
in Sacramento and was tendered
a formal reception at Y. M. C. A. Hall
to-night. On Friday night next Dr.
Greenburg will preach his Initial sermon.
Since the new rabbi is distinctly a be
liever in reformed Judaism, his advent is
not likely to have the effect of bringing
back to the fold those 'who have been
alienated by the advanced doctrines of H.
Â¦\\'eint>tock and others who have filled the
pulpit of the local synagogue from time to
time.
Readers of The Call will remember that
some weeks ago a number of well-known
Jews In Sacramento filed articles of Incor
poration of a religious body dedicated to
the strict observance of the Mosaic law
and the worship of what they conceived
to be the true Jewish religion. In a pub
lished statement the incorporators of this
yew organization asserted that in dis
cussing with liberality such subjects as
"Shall Jew and Christian Intermarry?"
H. Weinstock was departing from the
creed of the fathers and they preferred
their children to attend services where the
Hebrew language and the ancient Hebrew
religion should have ascendency. This
statement was followed by another from
Albert Elkus. president of the Congrega
tion B'nai Israel, in which Mr. Wein
stock's services to the synagogue were
acknowledged and his advanced expres
sions sustained.

PRINCETON, N. J.. April 4.â Former

"This Is fine," was his exclamation
when he first heard the tidings; then he
added to me:
"Look at his record in the Philippines.
Such diplomacy was after my own heart
cool, solid, firm, unchangeable. Long ago
I picked him for a great statesman. 1

SAN JOSE, April 4.â Justice of the
Peace Dyer of Palo Alto appeared before
the Board of Supervisors this morning In
answer to a summons to show cause why
he should not be removed from office for
his actions in the disgraceful proceedings
recently enacted in the kidnaping case at
Palo Alto. He was represented by At
torney Joseph Hutchinson, who Inquired
if there were any written charges against
Dyer. The attorney stated Dyer was will
ing to waive all technicalities in the mat
ter, but asked that hearing be postponed
a few days, when he would make a full
explanation. If desired.
It developed that the Supervisors had
no jurisdiction in the matter, and on mo
tion of Supervisor Rea the matter was
referred to District Attorney Campbell,
with instructions that he investigate and
prosecute, if the evidence should war
rant.
The mass meeting last night has had
a good effect, and will do much to purge
San Jose of the infamous proceedings in
Chinese cases that have characterized
its justice courts. The Chinese have al
most monopolized these courts. Factional
wars have been frequent in Chinatown and
kidnaping cases a common occurrence. A
number of unscrupulous attorneys have
prospered by this class of business. On
some occasions as high as forty warrants
in Chinese cases have been issued in a
single day in one Justice court. These
same warrants would be repeated in the
other Justice courts in this city and also
in the two courts In Santa Clara. They
would later be dismissed without prose
cution, thus mulcting the taxpayers of
many dollars.
Since the determined and general ris
ing of the people at last night's mass
meeting there is a strong undercurrent
that these methods must be stopped or
the people will see why.
Wong Fong, the Chinese arrested in San
Francisco yesterday, is a prisoner in the
County Jail.
The finance committee appointed at last
night's meeting is receiving much encour
agement, and a good sum will be realized
to be used in prosecuting those who took
part In the outrage perpetrated upon Miss
Cameron.
MEETING AT PALO ALTO.
Upon Attorney's Advice Dyer and

STANFORD UNIVERSITY. April 4.â
The meeting of the citizens committee to
night, held for the purpose of examining
Dyer and Dunsmore as to their part in
the Chinese abduction case, made little
headway. Dyer and Dunsmore appeared
with their attorney, Joseph Hutchinson,
who, before his clients were allowed Lo
testify, wanted to know what was the
purpose of the meeting. Chairman Brun
stated that the committee granted that
it had no power to cross-examine the paiÂ»
ties, but would receive any voluntary
statements they might offer.
Attorney Hutchinson took exception to
Brun's action at last night's meeting in
San Jose, in reading Dyer's statement of
facts offered before the committee and
omitting his defense.. As Brun was un
able to state the purpose of the meeting
to Hutchinsun's satisfaction the attorney
advised his clients to answer no questions
and the party withdrew. The committee
then went into executive session.
Wong Foug, the Chinese arrested In San
Francisco, was given a preliminary hear
ing in Justice Van Buren's court in May
field last night. His trial was set for Sat
urday. In default of $5000 bail the pris
oner was taken to San Jose for safe
keeping.
hard*y time for the organization of a third
party before the next Presidential elec
tion. It is conceivable that his personal
popularity might once have carried him
into the White House Just as it Is con
ceivable that the popularity of General
Fltzhugh Lee might have made him a
candidate to be reckoned with, or that
General Miles might .have become at least
a nominee when the country looked upon
him as the victim of a low political ex
pedient. But that time is past. Â¦.; -.
Evening News (Ind.): Admiral Dewey
has announced himself as a candidate for
the Presidency and Mr. McKinley s ad
ministration has passed the Porto Riean
tariff bill. What more does the Democ
ra The\lmes Herald: "I think I have said
enough at this time," declared Admiral
Dewey as he concluded his Presidential
interview, "and perhaps too much." Pity
that the Judgment that was expressed In
this comment had not been formed before
ever a word was uttered. For, If the
speaker is correctly reported, a more as
tonishing explanation of a complete
change of position, a more curious justi
fication of a great political ambition,
has never been heard by man. We doubt
if the disturbance will be very great poli
tically. As the Brooklyn Eagle said in
an editorial which Admiral Dewey pro
nounced bad and wretched, "Democracy
or Republicanism could invest in him only
as a speculation," and he Is not so allur
ing an investment as he once was. Not
even Republicans who are opposed to Mc-
Kinley or Democrats who are opposed to
Bryan would care to feed their antipathy
by taking chances with his "availability"
after they had realized the Indiscretion
of his utterances. .
The Tribune: Admiral Dewey has re
suscitated the question of his Presidential
fitness and announces to the public that
while a few months ago he did not believe
he had the quallnctlona a chief magis
trate should possess, he has made up his
mind that "the office is not such a very
difficult one to fill," the, duties "beJng
mainly to execute the laws of Congress."
This declaration Is one which will be
deeply regretted by sincere admirers of
the admiral. w^- >
The modesty with which he disclaimed
all Presidential aspirations a few months
ago made ttiem have an even higher opin
ion of the hero of Manila than they may
have now. Perhaps Admiral Dewey Is of
the opinion that both parties will compete,
for the honor of nominating him. It Is
not certain, however, he will receive a
proposal from either. It may be taken for
granted the Republican convention will
renomlnate President McKinley, who was
Admiral Dewey's favorite candidate when
he returned home. It Is not safe to as
sume the Democratic convention will
nominate the admiral. It may be s6 far
committed to Bryan as to be unable to do
so. Furthermore, that party has commit
ted Itself of late to policies of which the
nomination of Admiral Dewey would be
a sudden and startling abandonment. The
admiral may be looked upon as an orig
inal expansionist. What could be more
mortifying, cruel and humiliating for
Bryan than for his party to put In his
place a man who is the outward and visi
ble exponent of what Bryan has been de
nouncing for more than a year? But the
Democratic party Is skilled. in the art of
reversing Itself, especially of late years.
It Is guided by expediency rather than
convictions. Yet the- substitution of
Dewey for Bryan would give the Republi
can party all It wanted to do to win a vic
tory. The former would make a poor
President if elected. He would no doubt
"execute the laws of Congress." He would
also execute the will of the few men and
the objectionable men who would have his
confidence.
The Inter Ocean: George Dewev.ls the
greatest living American. He Is the fore
most citizen of the republic. He has won
such degree -of fame and nffectlon from
the American people that it is difficult to
see what more of honor can be gained by
him as an American citizen. The Presi
dency of the republic is, of course, worthy
of any man's noblest- ambition." Yet. In

position ought to think many times of the

TO THE QUEEN

DUBLIN. April 4.â Queen Victoria land
ed In Ireland this morning for the first
time In thirty-nine year?. The disem
barkation from the royal yacht was ac
complished at 11:20. The commander of
the forces In Ireland, the Duke of Con
na'ight. the Lord Lieutenant, Earl Cado
gan, and their staffs greeted her Majesty,
and the ride from Kingstown to Dublin
commenced In splendid weather and be
fore huge and good-natured crowds.
At the entrance to the city she received
an address of welcome, and handed the
Lord Mayor the following reply:
"I thank you heartily for the loyal wel
come and good wishes which you have
tendered me en behalf of yourself and
your fellow citizens on my arrival In the
ancient capital of my Irish dominion- I
came to this fair country to seek a change
and rest and to revisit scenes which re
call to my mind the warm welcome given
to both myself and my belo\*ed husband. I
am deeply gratified that I have been able
at this time to see again the motherland
of those brave persons who have recently
distinguished themselves in the defense
of my crown and empire with cheerful
valor, as conspicuous now as ever in their
glorious past. I pray that the Almighty
God may ever guide and direct you In the
high function which you exercise for the
benefit of your fellow citizens." v
The Queen appeared to be much affected
by the warmth of her welcome.
'Mr. Burke, a son of the former city
sword-bearer, took the place of James
Egan. the sword-bearer, who had refused
to officiate, but the Lord Mayor himself
handed the sword and keys to her Maj
esty, who touched them.
The ceremonies at the city gate were
most picturesque. London's Jubilee Mayor
Sir George Faudet-Philips, said the cere
monies were the finest he had ever seen,
far surpassing those of the great jubilee.
In reply to the address of welcome of the
Township Commissioners of Kingstown
the Queen handed the following to the
chairman:
"I thank you for your loyal and dutiful
address and for the warm welcome
wherewith you have greeted me. On set
ting foot again on Irish soil I received
with heartfelt satisfaction your assur
ances of devotion and affection toward
me. I am looking forward with much
pleasure to my visit to this part of my
dominion, and I pray may God bless Ire
land's welfare and prosperity."
As this written reply was handed to
the chairman her Majesty said: "I am
very pleased to find myself In Ireland
again.
A slight shower marred for the mo
ment the prospects of the day, but it was
soon over and the weather remained
splendid. No sooner had the Queen ar
rived at the vice regal lodge and lunched
than she drove out again In Phoenix
Park, being much cheered.
It is understood that she expressed her
eelf as wonderfully pleased with the re
ception and as yet suffered no fatigue.
Dublin went wild with delight over the
excellence with which all the arrange
ments"Vere carried out. Not one black
flag or disloyal motto marked the line of
march, and the population burled all
political feeling for the tlm*Â». Before
landing, the Queen, who looked remark
ably well, asked for a bunch of sham
rocks. They were secured, and through
out the day she wore them pinned upon
her breast.
The Duke of Abereorn. premier peer of
Ireland, who, with the moat of the castle
party, went to the vice regal lodge after
the royal arrl\-al and wrote his name In
the visiting book, Fald to the correspond
ent of the Associated Press: "It is the
most wonderful, chivalrous and spontane
ous exhibition I hav^ ever seen, and I
am immensely proud of being an Irish
man. Neither the weather nor the
crowds could b# more propitious. The
demonstration showed, despite all politi
cal differences. Ireland Is a loyal portion
of the empire."
These sentiments are echoed by all the
Irish nobility who are gathered In Dub
lin In numbers never f^en before. From
the pier at Kingstown to the royal resi
dence In Phoenix Park the distance Is
about n!n*Â» miles. Crowds lined the en
tire distance, but there was practically
no disturbance, the police and military
preserving perfect order with les* effort
than would have been necessary In Lon
don. Thanks to the brisk wind and sun
shine the forest of bunting had regained
freshness aftor yesterday's soaking, and
then one could realize that the boast of
the Dublin neople that their decorations
surpassed thosÂ»Â» of th*Â« tuniW In Lon
don was not without foundation.
at least made an excuse regarding Its
whereabouts.
As the father was unable to obtain any
proof that a ceremony had been perform
ed he demanded the return of his daugh
ter. Thomas refused and the girl seemed
desirous of remaining with him. Her
brother. Lace Silvey, armed with a pistol,
called at the house where the two were
rooming and demanded that his sister re
turn with him to her father's home, and
when Thomas attempted to interfere he
fired several shots at him. none taking
effect. He succeeded In getting his sister
to her former home, but. through a seere t
means, she succeeded in carrying on a
correspondence with her lover and asked
him to take her back to him that both
might be happy. This correspondence was
carried on about a week when on the
afternoon of December 2T, accompanied
by her sister-in-law, she waited at the
door of the Star office, where Thomas was
employed, and waited for him to leave
the office. At 4:30 o'clock ho started out
of the door and was met by the woman
that claimed to be his wife. She engaged
him In conversation for a few moments
and then pistol shots were heard by those
employed In the office. Thomas rushed
back into the office, closely followed by
Mias Silvey. who held the still smoking
revolver in her hand and was about to
aim again when she was disarmed by par
ties in the office. Thomas sank Into a
c.iair, exclaiming: "I'm shot." He was
removed to his room and medical aid
summoned. He suffered greatly during
the night and r> n the following day the
bullet was removed. After lingering
through the night he died at 7 o'clock on
Friday morning.
Released on Bail.
Miss .Silvey. after she fired the fatal
shot, walked with her sister-in-law down
the stairs to the street and started to
ward home, but was overtaken and ar
rested and lodged in jail, but was after
ward released on $1000 ball. After the
aeath of Thomas she was rearrested and
charged with murder. She appeared in
the Justice Court and was hem to appear
before the Superior Court. On a doctor's
certificate, which represented that the
Jail was unfit for one so delicate, she was
released on $12,000 ball.
Thomas was born in Mondenon. lowa.
Before he came to California he married,
but was divorced. After coming to Cali
fornia he located In Suisun, where he
again married. After a short time he sep
arated from his wife, but did not get a
divorce, which explains why he did not
carry Miss Silvey.
MERCED. April 4.â The trial of Miss
Marguerite Silvey, charged with havlcg
killed Charles A. Thomas last December,
commenced In the Superior Court th.li
morning. Judge J. K. Law presiding. J.
W. Knox appeared for the defendant and
District Attorney* F. G. Ostrander. assist
ed by F. W. Henderson, represented the
people.
Shortly before 10 o'clock Miss Silvey. ac
companied by her father, mother and her
sister-in-law, Mrs. Dora Silvey, who was
with her when she shot Thomas, entered
the room and was seated near Miss Sil
vey's attorney. The defendant was very
pale and showed signs of nervousness.
The foliowir.g jurors were selected: C.
C. Nelson. R. H. Wallls, Thomas Max

iam Robinson, Freeman Lowell. S. O.
Chittenden. F. M. Preston, W. H. McEl

taking of evidence will commence to-mor

The young Jady whom Thomas married
after he secured his divorce from the wife
he left in lowa arrived here yesterday to
appear as a witness In the case. Her
grandfather. Rev. A. H. Hitchcock, and
her uncle, S. B. Priest, all of Suisun. and
D. H McDonald of Windsor, are also
her* as witnesses. The latter married a
sister of Thomas and is editor of the
Windsor Herald.
Promise of THarriage.
The circumstances of the murder are as
follows:
Charles A. Thomas, a reporter on the
Merced Star, after several months' court
ship with Miss Marguerite Silvey. was
several times requested by her folks to
rr.arry her, they believing that he had
betrayed her. Finally after 'several re
quests he agreed to do so, and on July 30,
IS*>9 both boarded, the southbound train,
stating to their friends that thÂ«Â»y were go
ing to Ix>s Angeles to be wedded.
When th^y arrived at Fresno they pot
off the train arid registered at a hotel un
der aesumed names as man and wife.
After a few days Miss Silvey returned to
Merced, he remaining in Fresno, to follow
four days lat^r. and upon his arrival he
introduced her as his wife, and the two
lived as such until the girl's father, be
lieving that all was not as it should be,
asked Thomas to show the marriage cer
tificate, which Thomas refused to do, or
KENTUCKIANS
IN WORDY WAR
IN THE HOUSE
Wheeler and Pugh Clash
Over the Frankfort
Situation.
Exciting Scene During the Discussion
of the Bill Providing a Form
of Government for
1 Hawaii.
â¢
WASHINGTON, April 4.-There was an
exciting scene in the House to-day as the
climax of a discussion of the Kentucky
situation, when Wheeler, a Kentucky
Democrat, and Pugh, a Kentucky Repub
lican, faced each other from opposite
sides of the main aisle and Indulged in a
wordy duel. Pugh charged Wheeler with
having misrepresented certain facts. He
was laboring under great excitement.
Wheeler showed admirable temper and,
though quick to resent tne fancied insult.
awaited the explanation of Pugh, In which
he disclaimed any intention of Imputing
to him personally a desire to distort the
facts. Throughout the debate, which was
precipitated by Boreing, the other Repub
lican member from Kentucky, there was
an air of suppressed excitement. It was
the first time the subject had been
broached in the House and great interest
was manifested. Lacy of lowa. concluded
the debate with a general denunciation of
the Goebel election law. This incident
overshadowed tht other speeches to-day
on the Hawaiian bill, many of which were
irrelevant.
When the House resumed the consider
ation of the bill to establish a territorial
government in Hawaii. McDowell of Ohio,
a member of the Committee on Territo
ries, was the first speaker. While Mc-
Dowell was speaking the clerk of the
Senate appeared and announced the pas
sage of the Porto Rican tariff bill with
"sundry amendments In which the con
currence of the House Is requested." The
bill was immediately referred, under the
rule, to the Committee on Ways and
Means.
Free Entry to Coolies.
McDowell, one of the original opponents
of the annexation of Hawaii, inveighed
against the labor conditions in the islands
and the Influence of corporations there.
i He approved some of the features of the
bill, but was severe in his condemnation
of the tenth section, which, he said, con
' tinued in force the labor contracts made
with imported Chinese and Japanese.
De Armond of Missouri believed the bill
would allow all the Chinese and Japanese
In the islands free entry into the United
States. He also denounced that section
' of the bill which extended the constitu
tion to the islands as far as applicable.
He took the ground that the constitution
was there of its own vigor. If not. Con
gress by enactment could not extend it
there.
Boreing of Kentucky aroused general
Interest by discussing the Kentucky situ
ation. Holding the light of civilization
before the world as the United States
were doing, were we. he asked, willing
Â«to tee the torch of liberty extinguished
at the birthplace of Abraham Lincoln and
the home of Henry Clay. It was with no
spirit of acrimony, he said, that he re
ferred to the situation in Kentucky. So
far as the Goebei election law that
; State was concerned, he said, the peo
ple of Kentucky would be glad to ex
change places with Porto Rico or Ha
waii. They were not asking for Federal
interference â they were asking simply
for a fair election law. In conclusion he
gave notice to the country that if it wero
necessary to get rid of the Goebel law
he would ask for tho passage of a Federal
election law.
Borelng's speech drew the fire of
Wheeler of Kentucky, who replied In a
fierce speech. He had sincerely hoped, he
said, that the Kentucky situation would
not be brought to the attention of Con
gress. He admitted that the situation was
humiliating to every Kentuckian, but had
hoped that It would not be ventilated
here.
Defends the Goebel Law.
Proceeding he eulogized the Goebel elec
tion law, which had been declared con
stitutional by the highest court of the
State. To that decision, he said, it was
the duty of every law-abiding citizen to
bow. He would not contend that .the
dominant party had not taken advantage
of its power in districting the State. It
had done so. following the tactics of the
dominant party in most of the States.
In conclusion Wheeler assured those
who had crowded about during the ex
citement and the packed galleries that
there would be no blood shed in Ken
tucky.
"But." he said, "the Goebel law Is there
to stay. It will remain as a permanent
and enduring monument to the knightly
son of Kentucky who was stricken down
by a concealed and cowardly assassin."
The Democrats gave Wheeler a round
of applause when he concluded.

HOVERS OVER
THE SENATE
Friends and Opponents of
Quay Patch Up Their
Differences.
Wolcott Apologizes to LodgÂ« and It
Is Agreed to Take Up the Caaa
of the Pennsylvania!!
WASHINGTON, April 4.-Peace was
restored in the Senate before that body
convened to-day, and during the proceed
ings there was only a reminder of the
harsh language used lust before adjourn
ment yesterday. The session opened with
a lively and interesting discussion of the
etatus of the Quay caas, in the course of
which TTolcott aoolog-ized for the lan
guagre he had used yesterday, disclaiming
any intention of being offensive to any
body, least of all to his friend. Lodge. The
Colorado Senator made a vehement and
eloquent appeal for early action upon the
Quay case. He was supported by other
friends of Quay, and it was decided
finally to take up the case to-morrow, un
der the unanimous consent agreement
made on March 16. In accordance also
with that agreement the Spooner bill was
made the unfinished business, thereby
bringing the Philippine question to a di
rect issue In the Senate.
"There is a great State," said "Wolcott.
"which is not represented here as It la
entitled to be. That State has almost as
many inhabitants as there are Tagalos*
in the Philippines, and yet Senators would
hold one of its Senators at the door of this
body. It Is not a question of the person
ality of Mr. Quay, but one of proper rep
resentation of the State of Pennsylvania.
"Here we have a Senator, brave, kindly
and able, dear to the people of his com
monwealth. He is rightfully entitled to
a seat in this body as an appointee of the
Governor. This Senator has been sub
jected to more vicious and overwhelming
attacks than any man in public life to
day. It is cruel If this Senate, where he
served with honor and distinction for
twelve years, shall give him the final
stab which may end nis public career."
Wolcott then referred to Quay's political
work, which he thought had brought him
many enemies, especially his service as
the national chairman of the Republican
party. Every man who filled such a po
sition was In danger of hia reputation. He
believed that the Senator from Arkansas
(Jones), who had served at the head of a
political committee, had come out of the
fire with as little of the odor of smoke on
him as ever a man had. but that might
have been, said Wolcott, facetiously, be
cause he had little money to spend.
"And I am quite satisfied. continued
Wolcott. "that if the Senator from Arkan
sas Is at the head of the committee this
year he will come out absolutely un
smirehed."
Referring to the Incident of yesterday
Lodge said that no explanation from Wol
cntt was necessary to assure him that he
fWolcotO had meant no personal reflec
tion upon him in his remarks of yester
day.
At Carter's request the Alaskan code
bill was then taken up. Morgan made an
effort to have a day set for the considera
tion of the Nicaragua canal bill, but Ma
son objected, -saying he favored the canal
bill, but he did not want the time deter
mined until the fate of the Hay-Paunce
fote treaty were known. He did not be
lieve that the people generally would want
the canal at all if it were to be construct
ed under the terms of the treaty. This
objection served to prevent the granting
of Morgan's request.
Consideration of the Alaskan bill was
proceeded with on the basts of Senator
Hansbrough's amendment for the exclu
sion of alien minors from the mines of
Alaska. In this connection Hansbrough
had a letter from an American miner read,
complaining of the mining regulations of
the Canadian Government as unjust and
oppressive. The writer said that he had
addressed a letter to Secretary Hay de
nouncing the Canadian retroactive law as
"highway robbery."
Piatt of Connecticut suggested careful
Inquiry into the Canadian laws before
taking action upon the Hansbrough
amendment, saying that retaliation on the
part of Canada might follow.
After some further discussion action up
on the amendment was postponed.

Died on the Street.
William Jurgens, a brewer, residing at
227 Francisco street, fell dead at 3:45
o'clock yesterday afternoon while walk-

Intersection of Broadway. Deceased was
57 years old and a native of Germany. The

POPULAR THEATRICAL
MAN PASSES AWAY
DEATH has claimed Charles
Schimpf, secretary of the Walter
Orpheum Company, and one of
the most popular theatrical men on
the coast. Mr. Schimpf passed away at
the German Hospital last night as the re
sult of an operation for appendicitis, per
formed ten days ago.
Mr. Schimpf was a nephew of the late
Gustav Walter and was born in New Tork
thirty-two years ago. When Mr. Walter
opened the Rathskeller, at the corner of
Turk and Mason streets, years ago, he
brought his nephew out from the East
and placed him in the box office as as
sistant ticket agent. When Walter
opened the Orpheum Mr. Schimpf occu
pied a similar position in that Institution,
and when the branch Orpheum was estab
lished in Los Angeles he was sent to that
city as treasurer and assistant manager.
On the death of Gustav Walter his
widow brought Mr. Schimpf back to San
Francisco to act as her representative at
the local theater.
John Morrisey. manager of the Or
pheum, paid a high tribute to Mr.
Schimpf's many good qualities last night
and expressed deep regret at his untimely
death. Deceased left a widow, a daughter
Of Mrs. A. T. Dunphy, but no children.
CAPE NOME AS A PORT
OF ENTRY FOR ALASKA
Special Treasury Agent Evans Here
to Take Testimony on the
Question.
J. F. Evans, special treasury agent for
Alaska, who will take testimony for and
against the proposition of making Cape
Nome a port of entry, has arrived here.
In regard to Cape Nome as a port of
entry the interests of Canada and British
Columbia are ranged on one side and the
shipping Interests of the United States on
the other. If the commercial and ship
ping facilities of this coast are sufficient
to transact the business it is not In the
interest of San Francisco to have Cape
Nome made a port of entry, and the ad
ministration would not feel disposed to
cripple trade if facilities for doing busi
ness could be furnished at this port. For
this reason Colonel Evans is seeking in
formation and testimony from the com
mercial and shipping interests here on
this matter.
Seattle, with her rival interests and a
railroad running north and connecting
with the Canadian Pacific, has such Brit
ish connections and interests as induce it
to favor the making of Cape Nome a port
of entry. Hence the significance of Col
onel Evans' stay here for the coming two
weeks.

HONOLULU HEALTH BOARD
DENOUNCED BY DR. LEVY
Well Knou-n Rabbi Declares There |
Was No Plague â Claims His
Son Was Unfairly Treated.
Mrs. M. S. Levy, wife of the well-known |
rabbi of this city, left for Honolulu i
yesterday on the steamship Australia i
for the purpose of visiting and nursing
her Pon Herman, who w.-is reported on the
Ut of March last to have contracted bu- I
bor.ic plague. The family of the young
man has been In 'a state of distress over
Uie unwelcome tiding* and have waited
â¢ overly for news of hiÂ« condition. Wht-n
!he rumor of Herman Levy's dread 111
?: ess reached his parents they also re- i
oetved the promise of Dr. Hoffman, chief
of staff o' the Board of Health of Ho
nolulu, that he would keep them apprised
of their eon's condition. Th* doctor's
failure to do so has caused great anxiety
to Rabbi Levy and his family.
Rabbi Levy is indignant because of Dr.
Hoffman's forgetfu'.ness and mure fo over
the uncharitable and brutal way his son
has been treated by the Health Depart
ment of Honolulu. In an interview last
night h* expressed his opinion that thÂ«re
was no plague in Honolulu, and that the
ecart was brought about so that certain
officials could lay their "claws like vul
tures" upon the gold set aside fur the
purpose of protecting the city from the
dread disease.
"On the Ist of March." he tsaid. "it was
reported that my son Herman was sus
pected of having bubonic plague. On that
occasion I received a note from Dr. Hoff
man, chief of stafr of the Board of Health
of Honolulu, informing me of the condi
tion of my fion, his temperature, pulse
and respiration, ail of which were of an
alarming character. He further volun
teered the Ftatement that he would keep
me well informed as to the condition of
my son on each and every outgoing
steamer. This he has failr-d "to do. By
reason of an article which appeared in
The CaJl of last week, wherein it was
stated that from information they had re
ceived an>l from interviews that "had beÂ«n
published from prominent business men
of Honolulu, it would appear that there
has never been a genuine case of bubonic
plague in the city of Honolulu, and that
the. whole scare was a fake.
"This proposition seems feasible when
Â»c stop to consider that the Government
funds amounting to neatly three-quarters
of a million dollars were at the disposal
<jf the Hoard of Health to stamp out fhc
bubonic plague. Personally I believe The
Call's representations. I cannot believe
that anything e.o audacious could possi
bly be perpertaed upon an indulgent com
munity. But when a young man is kept
in the pesthnuse for twenty-four days
and the Board of Health is either too
cowardly or too ignorant to publish to
the world what ailment has kept Â¦him in
the pesthoupe all that time, then it Is but
natural that our suspicions should be
aroused and that we should th-ink that
this cry of plague was a fake. It is im
possible at thic time, so near the Passover
holidays, for me to go on this errand of
mercy instead of Mrs. Levy, but under all
circumstances our child needs careful
nursing, and we are determined to probe
to the very bottom what power and what
right was Riven the Board of Health of
Honolulu to take a young man from his
oottape at the dead of night, pump Pas
teur serum into his body on peveral occa
sions, without there ever having been, so
far as our information goes, a single in
dication of plajrue in his system.
"The physicians have- acknowledged
that there were no 'buboes,' that the pa
tient was never delirious, and animals in
oculated with his 'sputem' still live. Can
any reasonable person doubt these condi
tions that his illness was anything but
the plague? If we shall have evidence to
fustain us in this matter we shall make
the Board of Health feel the injustice and
wrong they have perpetrated upon our
Fon. as well as the anguish and anxiety
and sorrow they have brought upon our
family."

MRS. BALLINGTON BOOTH
TALKS OF PRISON WORK
Tells of the Great Reform Among
Criminals Due to the Efforts
of Salvationists.
Mrs. Maud Ballinglor. Booth met a
number of ladies and gentlemen In the
parlors of the Occidental Hotel yesterday
and told them about her prison work.
Although the movement had originated in
New York scarcely more than three years
ago It has proved successful far beyond
the hopes and expectations of Mrs.
Booth. Out of SOO ex-convlcts who have
passed through Hope Hall In New York
75 per cent have been permanently re
formed and most of them have become
active Christians. The work has passed
beyond the experimental stage and can
now be eet down as practical and perma
ment, and tho only way of successfully
dealing with criminals and making them,
good and useful citizens.
Wardens all over the United States,
paid Mrs. Booth, recognize the work as an

CURTIS DENIES ALL
KNOWLEDGE OF JONES
Has Letters Showing Excellent In
dorsements of Character by
Prominent Men.
George F. Curtis denies that he has any
connection with or knowledge of tho lot
tery game that D. 11. Jones and L. O.*
Skancke are engaged in, and said last
evening that he had never heard of either
of them before The Call's expose of
yesterday morning. A Washington dis
patch cous>led Mr. Curtis with Jones and
Skancke. Mr. Curtis shows by papers in
his popsespion' that he has the very hlgh
est connections, and that Justices of the
Supreme Court of the United States and
other leading men of the country, in po
litical life and on the bench, have spoken
in the highest and most unqualified terms
concerning his worth as a man. Among
the number are General Joe Whcelc-r, Jo
seph H. Choate, Chief Justice Brewer of
the Supreme Court of the United States
and Associate Justices Field, Brown and
Shiras. He came West some time ago to
identify himself with the legal fraternity
of the Pacific Coast, bringing the letters
from the persons named and from many
others of prominence. He was the law
librarian of Congress for eleven years and
has a complimentary letter from libra

matter. He has a suit now pending
against the Swiss Government, which has

BOARD OF WORKS
ESTIMATES ARE
TO BE REDUCED
Auditor Finds Big Increase
in Cost of Engineer's
Department.
Contemplated Expenditures of tho
. Commission Exceed One-Third
of the Total Probable Mu
nicipal Revenue.
The Auditor's clerks were kept busy
yesterday reducing the amount of money
estimated by the Board of Public .Works
to be necessary for the maintenance of its
several departments during the next fis
cal year. In the one item of the estima
ted expenses of the Bureau of Engineer-
Ing an enormous Increase has beÂ«n dis
covered over the amount expended for the
same work during the fiscal year of 189S
1599. The consolidation act provided that
the City Engineer should receive $500 per
year and all fees, out of which he was to
pay his deputies. The salaries of the lat
ter under Charles Tllton amounted to
something over $18,000 for the year named.
The office was self-sustaining, but cost
the city $11,706 for surveys. It Is thought
that the City Surveyor had over $5000 for
himself after paying all the expenses of
the office.
The following Is the amount estimated
as necessary for the Bureau of Engineer-
Ing, which takes the place under the new
charter of the Surveyor's Department:
Salary of City Engineer, $5000; investigation
of plans and estimates of cost of publio utill
tlpp. ir.n.OOO: division of streets and lot sur
veys, $59,450; division of construction, $9540; of
fice equipment, testing appliances, chemical
laboratory, etc., $4100. Total, $133,120.
Eliminating; the item of $55,000 for the
Investigation of plans and estimates of
cost of public utilities will leave $78,120,
which the city will be required to pay for
the department undfer the charter, as
against $11,706 under the old law.
For the Bureau of Streets the estimate
of the Board of Work? for the next year
has been placed at $6*7,720. whereas for the
last fiscal year the expenses of the Street
Department were $410,500. Estimated in
crease this year over last. $267,220.
For new departments the sum of $307,
4fio 50 Is asked: the Bureau of Light and
Water, which corresponds* to the Gas In
ppector's office, will cost $2350; stationery,
$3000: expenses of peneral office. $21,960;
recommendations for repairs to City Hall,
$113,687: sewer construction. $229,750. mak
inp a grand total of $1,499,047 50 which the
Board of Public Works desires to spend,
or over one-third of the probable amount
which will be raised by, taxation and other
sources of revenue.

TRIES TO SHOW
THAT SYLVA DID
TAKE A BRIBE
Cross-Examination Fails to
Shake Sausalito Man's
Tale.
Wind-Up of the Testimony of the
First Witness of the Defense.
Dunand Will Take the
Stand To-Day. â¢
Adolph Sylva. politician, journeyman at
the law, trickster, raiser of chickens, mu
sician, theatrical manager, scientist,
scholar and a man with a romantic past,
has had his say on the witness stand and
left his mark in tho Craven-Fair litiga
tion now being conducted before Judge
Troutt.
He was examined on Monday by George
Knight, subjected to cross-examination
all of Tuesday, yesterday morning and
the greater portion of the afternoon, and
to re-direct examination during the last
half hour of yesterday's session. Then
he went his way. smiling, self -satisfied
and happy. His story was not broken by
opposing counsel; nor was he at any time
left floundering or ill at ease. He wore
Lafe Pence on: in the cross-examination,
gaining increase of strength and spirit
as he was baited from timtr to time by the
petitioner's head counsel.
The cross-examination yesterday was
confined to conferÂ«ncf s which Harvey and
Sylva held in the PeerH-ss <= a ioon. to the
reading of newspaper clippings to the
witness and the forcing of a i.enial from
him as to their intrinsic truth, although
he admitted that he- was responsible for
them. The most interesting portion of
the day was Sylva's recital of a section
of his owti life when he chased from one
city to another'en the continent in search
of his wife and her Kng'ish captain of the
sruards.
Sylva and Joe Harvey
In regard to the Tnt-eting between Joe
Harvey and Sylva in the Peeritsx qaloon
on Wednesday. February 11. I\5S. the Savi
salito trieksi>r testified that their conver
sation was held in the side room; off the
bar. and was anything but what I^afe
Pence tried to fasten upon him. Perce
insistently inquired if Harvey had not
stated thai Simpton must be brought over
to the Fair c'.ce -it any cost, promising b'g
sums of money to Sylva if he would en
gineer the deal successful!:.-. To all of
these interrogations Sylva made emphatic
denial.
Pence then veered around, endeavoring
to gain an admission from the witness
that Farley, one of the proprietors of the
saloon, was present during the conversa
tions with Harvey (in that Wednesday
afternoon and evening and th*Â» following
Thursday afieri.oon. Sylva declared that
he and Harvey were in the back room of
the saloon am) it was there that they dis
cussed the Fair case, at all times without
the hearing ->f any other person in the
saloon. After the Wednesday afternoon
mertine \v:th Harvey Sylva rushed post
haste to Pence's office and with a lie on
his lip.* played the criss-cross game reek
intr with infamy.
Meetings With Harvey.
The following is a bit of tho cross-fire
and the negative answers in which the
witness found r. refuge:
"Did you not state to Harvey on Thurs
day. February 15, that the main trouble
was with The Call?" interrogated Attor
ney Pence.
'â¢No, sir; no, sir:" was Sylva's answer.
"Did you not state: "The Call reporter
caught me Tuesday night and I tcld him
that the interview with Simpton in re
gard to the marriage and the testimoney
of Mrs. Craven-Fair was true?" "
"I did not. No, Harvey and I had no
such conversation at any time."
"Was not 'Dick' Farley present in the
Peerless saloon when you met Mr. Har
vey on Tuesday. February 13. and did
he not say to you that Mrs. Craven had
testified that Judge Simpton performed
tne marriage ceremony between Senator
Fair and herself?"
"No, sir: no. sir; no, sir."
"Did not Harvey state it made no dif
ference what it might cost, Simpton must
que*>r h^r testimony?"
'No. sir; no. sir."
"Did he not ask how much it would
cost to have Simpton deny her story?"
"No. sir; no, sir: he did not."
You stated to Mr. Perkins of The Call,
did you not, when you came over in the
launch that day. that Simpton's story
was true, you having learned it many
months before?"
Yes, I told all the reporters that to
bluff them."
"Did you not state to Harvey that night
that the only way you could do business
was for cash and he replied, "have a little
patience, as Mr. Fair was pressed, but
you will get it all right?" "
"No. sir; no, sir; no, sir."
On Wednesday, February 14, Sylva had
another tete-a-tete with Harvey In the
Peerless, after which he went directly to
Pence & Pence.
"When you were In the saloon did not
narvey ask you again: 'How much is it
going "to cost to get Simpton?" "
The usual negative response came in
the characteristic guttural tones.
Refreshed His Memory.
On Tuesday Sylva would not trust him
self with admissions of dates, but there
was no hesitancy yesterday. From place
to place he traced his career, giving the
year in which he stopped at each place.
His memory was refreshed by looking
over his own papers.
When Knight took Sylva In hand the
story of the charges of embezzlement In
1592. which the trial failed to prove, was
repeated and Sylva came out of it with
out much regret or show of confusion.

A large congregation listened to an ear

ald at St- Charles Church. The occasion
was the monthly lecture and religious ex
ercises of the Catholic Truth Society. The
speaker appealed to his auditors to read
the Bible daily, as it was the voice of
God. He called attention to the value of
such reading by saying it contained his
tory, the grandest poetry, oratory and
Catholic truth. All those who attended
the interesting exercises were presented
with copies of the pamphlets for holy

WRIGHT'S PENSION IS
HANGING BY A THREAD
EX-CAPTAIN OF POLICE WRIGHT,
who waÂ« retired on a pension by
the old Board of Police Commis
sioners just before it went out of
office, will in all probability be
compelled to again don his uniform or
suffer the humiliation of being dismissed
from the department. Prior to his re
tirement Wright, who acted as clerk to
ex-Chief of Police Lees, complained of
being temporarily disabled on account of
a severe attack of rheumatism. He con
sulted with the old Commissioners about
his condition and was advised by them to
apply for a pension, notwithstanding that
he had been connected with the police
force for only eight years, when the pro
vision of th^ charter specifically states
that a member of the department cannot
be retired on half pay except for physical
disability, unless he has been in actual
service for a period of twenty years.
Shortly after the new Commissioners
were inducted into office the retirement
of Wright was discussed, and notwith
standing that a majority of the members
of the board were in favor of ordering
him back into the department, final ac
tion was not taken. The matter has^ been
allowed to re?t since then and would per
haps nerer have been thought of again
if Wripht had not sent a communication
to the Police Board asking permission to
Wye the city. He stated that he was
about to jro to the Philippines and in
tended to remain there for some time.
Chief of Police Sullivan emphatically re
fused to l*-nd his consent to Wright leav
ing the State. He spoke of the retire
ment of the ex-captain a? being a nag
rant violation of the law and a rank in
justice to the other members of the de
partment who are entitled to pensions and
who have been denied them on account Of
the condition of the pension fund. He was
in favor of forcing Wright to again don
thÂ«Â« stripes or be summarily deprived oi
his pension.
After considerable discussion It was
finally decided to ord*r the ex-captain to
appear before the examining physicians
of the Police Department to be examine*!
as to his physical fitness to do future
duty If they report favorably on his
condition Wright will be given the alter
native of reporting for police duty or hay-
ing- his name stricken from the pension
roll.
It Is the firm resolve of the board to
have the men who hereafter seek ten
sions undergo a thorough physical exami
nation before their applications to be
placed on the retired list shall be consid
ered. They ar^ue that If this had been
done in Wright's cast- he would not have
been granted a pension.
The friends of the ex-captain say that
he was disabled while in the discharge
of his duties and was as much entitled
tn a pension as any of the older mem
bers whose names were placed on the
retired list. It Is more than likely that
the matter will be taken up at the next
meetinp of the board, which will be on
Tuesday afternoon.

HEADQUARTERS
OF THE THIRD
FOR PRESIDIO
Colonel Rawles Notified That
He Will Soon Be Trans
ferred.
Report That Orders Once More Mak
ing the Presidio an Artillery
Post Have Been
Issued.
The long expected appears about to hap
pen, and The Presidio is to come under the
orders <<f an art;li<ry headquarters. A
telegram to Colonel Kawlcs. commanding
the Third Artillery, stationed at Argel
Island, from Colonel Rogers, commanding
ihe Fir.Â«t ArtilU ry. who is In Washington.
announced that fact yesterday. The tel* I 
frara stated that the order transferring
the hc.-'dTuarters of the Third Artillery
to the Presidio had been issued.
The report has gone all over the Ire
Fidio, and the source of it gives it cre
dence at ence. Colonel Rogers would not
fcecd-such a telegram witnout bting sure
d what be was saying, and the fact that
h* telegraphed that tt:e order is actuall>
out is taiien to mean that the transfer is
setT.ti.
Xtie particular interest attached to the
trtrsftr is tna.t GeneraJ Shatter has de
clared that so lons as he Is in command
ct the Department of California the Pre
sidio shail be an Infantry or cavalry post;
that is. that the commanding officers shall
be of that branch of the service, and v
possible the garrison also. Opposea to this
has always been the Influence of the artil
iery arm of the service. The post was
governed by artillery cf.icers for years;
In fact, until General Shafter, then colonel
of the First Infantry, was taken from
Ar.gel Island after yrars of service there
ana made commandant of the Presidio.
The rule ra.< the other way before that,
and the First Infantry was left to sax
rison the post at Angel Island, while the
artiiiery garr;s< r.t d tne Presidio under the
idea that th<- artillerymen should be near
the guns. Shatter's iaea wap that artillery
belonged to fortifications and infantry a^d
cavalry to an unfortified post, such as tne
Prtsidio is. and he believed that if artii
lery were sent t<> the Presidio at all it
should be quartered out at old Fort Scott.
rÂ»-ar where the military works are lo
cated.
The coming of the headquarters of the
Third Artillery is taken therefore to mean
a relapse into the old order of thirds and
a move directly at variance with the pol
icy outlined by Genera! Shafter. His idea
Â©f bavins the Presidio an infantry or
c;-.\\S.ry post was held alsu by General
Miles. It seems, however, unless t'olonel
Rawing !::<..Â« bt-en misinformed, that the
influence of the artillery has bÂ»*en too
rtronu >>r that Shafter has weakened a
I>c;r.t. for the Presidio is a prize post, arid
Â»h'*vÂ«r pets It is fortunate.
As to the disposition of Colonel Esk
riiip*^. who commands the post at present.
tn the event of the advent of the Third.
::g is known. It was General Shaf
rer's icier, that he should command the
- Slo with thÂ« â¢:â¢â¢!:â¢.. battalion of the
Twtr.ty-thlrd as garrison, but if the in

GREAT CHANGES
IN SCHOOL LAWS
Committee of Educators Gives
Â¦ Out Its Preliminary
Report. .
State Text-Books Are Declared to Be
Below Grade â High Schools to
Be Recognized by the
Constitution.
Â«
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1113 Broadway, April 4.
A sub-committee of the State Educa
tional Commission has been at work in
Oakland for some timf preparing a report
to the main body upon necessary chances
in the educational laws of California. This
committee has prepared its report, which
will be submitted to the main body, which
will consider it. and then report finally
to the State I.eKi.Â«lature. The importance
of this report lies In the fact that the
main body will probably adopt it as their
report. Theso proposed changes in the
State educational laws interest the entire
State and are somewhat radical. The
State text took? are declared not to be
up to jjrade. and no recommendation Is
made in rcpard to them.
The sub-cemmittee which prepared this
report is composed of the following 1 : State
Superintendent J. Kirk, chairman; G. W.
Beattle. secretary: J. W. McClymonds.
Elmer E. Brown. Kllwood P. Cubberley.
J. \K. Linscott. Robert Furlong, R. M.
Shackelford.
The important portions of the report are
as follows:
Teachers' Certificates
1. r> changes should be mii* unar impair
the validity of existing certificates.
J. Statistics show that the formal examina
tion as a basis for certification is becoming
Obsolete and that the credential basis Is rapidly
increasing In favor. Also that our professional
training schools are supplying as many teach-
ers ac the schools require.
3. The large excess of certificated teachers In j
the State makes It i.racticable t,Â» raise the re- j
â¢juirement for teachers' certificates.
4. <a> High school certificates should be iÂ«- !
surd on credentials only: "h> elementary, kin- I
dergarten and special certificates should be j
based on credentials or on examination in ac- â¢
cordanc* with higher standards than now pre- !
Tall: rurh examinations should be held not >
oftener than once a year: Â«c> the Issuance of
primary certificates and of educational diplo
mas should be discontinued.
Gradations of Schools
1. Ninth grades to become part or the H!gn
School course.
2. State constitution to be amenied to allow
State pchool funds to be applied to High
School*
The Tnoct urgent question with reference tn
the cradatinn of <'ur srho..ls 1? the question as
to where the trammar schoo! fhall end ami the
h'.ph Frh^.l begin. The practice in the several
counties varies considerably with reference to
this point, but we believe a larse majority of
the yehoo! chihlren In the State are to be found
In districts In which the ninth trrade ia count
ed as a i>art of the grammar schr.ol. In th'.s
California, differ? from tho t.est usage of the
country at larsre. which treats the ninth grade
as belcruing to secondary education.
The disposition In California to lengthen out
the jfrarr.rr.ar school nnduly ;ivt<Â« us at a dis
advantage as ronipar^l with â¢ :hÂ«r r^-"'"'' Â»f
the country, which are more free to adopt Im
provements in thin staKe uf iiirtrucci' .i. aim it
Is well known that the Calif->rn .> practice :i>
this rppard Is the outcome of the clauÂ«e of ar
ticle IX. section 6. of the State constitution,
which provides that "the entire revenue derived
from the State school fun 1 and the State school
tax shall be appliM exclusively to the support
of primary and crammar schools." S?uch a
provision Is not found In the constitution or
the statutes of other leadinij educational States

VICTORIA IN IRELAND.
ACCORDING to the statements of some of the
more influential papers of London, the recent
imperial demonstration on St. Patrick's day
and the visit of the Queen to Ireland are designed to
be something more than a compliment to the valor of
the Irish troops in South Africa. They are intended
as overtures to the Irish and forecast the adoption of
a policy of conciliation on a comprehensive scale.
In support of that view of the case the London
Chronicle in commenting upon the situation says:
"The meaning of those who, not being Irishmen,
made a point of acclaiming Irish gallantry and self
sacrifice on St. Patrick's day. from the Queen on the
throne to the man in the street, was to extend the
hand of brotherhood, to suggest oblivion of past
discords, and to offer an equitable and a generous
settlement of every outstanding grievance. Irishmen
v.-ho cannot read so much as this between the lines
of Saturday's record, and who cannot find this
significance in the wave of popular sentiment which
has pulsed round the empire since her Majesty's
gracious initiative less than a fortnight ago, must be
blind indeed to all that most nearly concerns them."
How far the British Tories are sincere, in this sud
den manifestation of a desire for a "union of hearts
and a union of hands," and how far the Irish patriots
will reciprocate it, are matters that remain to be seen.
Conciliation is a plant of slow growth. The heredi
tary antagonisms and prejudices of centuries are not
to be overcome in a day, not even if it be a day so
halcyon and vociferous as was that of St. Patrick.
The refusal of James Egan, the city swordbearer of
Dublin, to present the sword to Victoria or to take
any part in the ceremonies of welcome is significant
of the attitude of thousands of representative Irish
men. On the other hand, a good deal of praise has
been given in Great Britain to a recent letter of John
Redmond, in which he is reported to have said: "It
seems likely that the great question in the immediate
future of imperial politics will be the question of im
perial federation. This, which up to the other day
was little more than a dream, has been brought
within range of practical politics by the war in South
Africa and by the action of the colonies in relation to
the empire. Any scheme of imperial federation must
include Ireland, and, while I do not look for a final
settlement of Irish questions in this direction, I think
I see a possibility in the near future of a further de
velopment of Irish self-government."
The terms of the letter declare a belief on the part
of Redmond that something like local self-govern
ment is in sight for Ireland, and the commendation
given to it in London implies a willingness on the
part of a considerable number of Englishmen to con
cede it. Victoria's visit may therefore prove to be
more than an idle holiday or a state, pageant. The
British empire. like our own republic, is confronting
a new era, and out of its complications Ireland may
STILL LIBELING CALIFORNIA.
Treka Journal.
Hearst of the New York Journal and
San Francisco Examiner is about as great
a liar in reporting the plague on this
coast as he is in traducing the administra
tion. No doubt he will next accuse Cali
fornia of being infected with smallpox,
if he can make a lot of nickels in doing
so The Examiner keeps a little more
shady for fear of loss, but Hearst's other
paper in New York is libeling California
most outrageously.
STATE SCHOOL PROBLEMS.
rROM the sub-committee appointed to outline
subjects for the consideration of the State Edu
cational Commission at its meeting on the I2th
of this month there has been issued a circular set
ting forth a number of important problems and
propositions for discussion. These, in the order in
which they are presented by the' committee, are as
follows: i. Certification of teachers and duties of
County Boards of Education. 2. Definition of grades,
relations of high schools, grammar and primary
grades to one another, constitutional amendments
concerning State school moneys. 3. A governing
board for normal schools and requirements for ad
mission to such schools. 4. Method of selecting the
Superintendent of Public Instruction. 5. Time of
electing school trustees and appointing teachers.
6. Compulsory education. 7. Attendance of trustees
at Teachers' Institutes. 8. Concentration and super
vision of rural schools and transportation of pupils.
9. Technical education. 10. State textbooks.
The constitutional amendments proposed are for
the purpose of removing the restrictions upon the
Legislature which prevent the adoption of the de
sired reforms in grading the schools. Two substi
tutes have been suggested, and it will be for the com
mission to consider which is the better. The first
would substitute for section 6 article IX of the con
stitution the following: "The public. school system
shall include primary and grammar schools and such
high schools, evening schools, normal schools and
technical schools as may be established by the Legis
lature, or by municipal or district authority."
The alternative substitute is more guarded in lan
guage. It provides: "The public school system
shall include primary and grammar schools, and such
high schools, evening schools, normal schools
and technical schools as may be established
by the Legislature or by municipal or dis
trict authority; but the entire revenue de
rived from the State school fund and the revenue
derived from taxes collected for primary and gram
mar schools shall be applied exclusively for the sup
port of primary and grammar schools. The revenue
derived from taxes collected for high schools and
technical schools shall be applied exclusively to the
support of such schools."
In support of the amendment the committee points
out that the effect of the present constitutional re
quirement is "to extend the term 'grammar school'
and the type of instruction proper to grammar schools
as far up the scale of our grades of instruction as they
can be pushed. It prevents the consideration of
questions relating to those grades on educational
grounds, and compels the consideration of such
questions instead on purely financial grounds."
Furthermore, the committee says: "Until this limi
tation is removed it is of no avail to recommend im
provements in the gradation of our schools at this
most vital point."
It will be noted that the question of school grading
as well as many others in the list affects some of the
most important features of our school system, and
the discussion of them by the State Commission will
awaken widespread interest. No part of the machin
ery of local administration more closely affects the
welfare of the commonwealth than that of education,
and its problems merit the attentive consideration of
all.
THE JOBBERS' CONTENTION.
Ti I E hearing of the differential case by the Inter
state Commerce Commission is the n:ean> of
furnishing valuable and needed information to
all shippers and business men. The jobbers of the
Middle West, who uphold the contentions of the
St. Louis Association, demand a rate on broken car
luad lots that will bring them in direct contact with
the retailers clear to the Pacific Ocean. With a highly
organized industry in manufacture and distribution
in their favor, such a freight rate enables the dumping
of their surplus here and the obliteration of the coast
fobbing trade. Standing at home as wholesalers en
a magnificent scale, they desire to appear here as
j eddlers, doling out their pack to the retailer, like
thread-and-ncedle men.
It must not be supposed that the granting of this
demand affects our jobbers only. It is equally against
our manufacturers. California has a field for manu
facture by the use of power that is of recent devel
opment, but incloses possibilities unequaled any
where else in the world. Our great mountain up
lift puts the law of gravity at our service in the un
limited water power furnished for the generation of
electricity. At the moment of the appearance of this
resource for power the great oil deposits are ex
ploited, and the use of oil in ore smelting comes to
the front. This State has never been efficiently pros
pected for iron, because our lack of coal threw the
smeiter back upon wood, and the consumption of the
forests for such purpose is inimical to our agricul
tural and horticultural interests, through the effect of
deforestation u*<on the conservation of water. But
v.uh oil as a fuel the prospect entirely changes, and
the iron prospects are destined to undergo before
long a searching examination, with the certainty of
finding ledges that will bring the supply of that metal
into prominence among our mineral resources Rm
as every one knows, the development of the useful
metals depends, primarily, upon a profitable local
consumption, and, with our existing manufactures
obatcrated upon the demand of the manufacturers of
the Middle West, the lure to iron ore development
goes out of existence. The jobbers and manufac
turers of the Middle West are commending to us a
medicine they would promptly reject for themselves.
If the Atlantic seaboard, from Mobile to Boston,
should present the claim that the Middle West is
their natural jobbing field, and that they must have a
broken carload rate that will dump their surplus upon
the shelves of all the retailers of that region, at a
price which the local manufacturers and jobbers can
rot meet and live, they would view the proposition
just as our Pacific Coast jobbers and manufacturers
view their present demand. This was demonstrated
by the keen interrogatory of Mr. Stubbs of the South
ern Pacific, who asked the Middle Westers if they did
not regard it as perfectly consistent for them to reach
into this territory and build up trade by selling on
close margins. They hastened eagerly to agree with
him. when he turned the other edge of his knife by
raying: "Then if the existing differentials give the
coast jobbers a slight advantage, is there any reason
why they should not use it to reach into remote dis
tricts and extend their trade farther East?"' The
Middle Westers avoided any further assent to any
proposition offered by Mr. Stubbs, for he seemed ro
have something up his sleeve.
It is a principle of business that the prosperity of
a community requires a full circle and not a segment
of business activities. To promote it there must be in
every great commercial and producing region such
manufactures as are natural and a wholesale and re
tiil trade in all the merchandise that is required by
the necessities of a people. For this principle the
Pacific Coast jobbers are contending, and have as
their allies the people who understand the conditions
of symmetrical development
The Interstate Commerce Commission is an impar
tial body. Its functions are judicial, and. although
the roast is handicapped by having no member on its
bench, we are sure that it will do nothing in violation
of what is clearly the natural law of trade and de
veiopment.
OUR STREET IMPROVEMENTS
UNDER BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS
The Call* does not hold itself responsible for
the opinions published in this column, but
presents them for whatever value they may
have ss communications of general interest
EDITOR The Call: Thanks to the
new charter, the citizens of San
Francisco have to pass through an
interesting period of moral evolu
tion and to adapt themselves, like Dar
win's species, to new conditions of life.
Just now they have slowly to educate up
to the level of our Board of Public Works.
Formerly when at the city front a street
became impassable the good, plain, more
or less honest men whom we had made
our Superintendent of Streets got a hun
dred dollars' worth of rocks together and
dumped them into the holes: the teams
rolled over the improvement smilingly and
hoped that in a year or so a new Super
intendent of Streets might do even bet
ter. Xow, of course, nobody cares to ex
pect that our Board of Public Works, pre
sided over by a real United States colonel
and composed of gentlemen who by birth,
education and talent are competent to
tackle the heaviest engineering problems
of the country, would dump rocks into
street holes like hayseed farmers. They
know better.
Plans are made to place the dilapidated
street on piles or on a concrete foundation
or both. Plans and specifications cost
alone as much as did the rocks of the
good old Street Superintendent. When
the bids come in the repairs of the faulty
block turn out to be a matter of say $.7)00
or more. Unfortunately it turns out. too,
that there is no such sum of money avail
able. Perhaps the board knew that be
forehand. Anyhow it has succeeded in
proving the fact in a scientific way. The
teamsters receive the hearty regrets of
the board and drive around the block as
before.
On Sixth street, between Folsom and
Harrison, a similar experience puzzles the
afflicted property owners. Our old-fash
ioned Superintendent of Streets, under the
pull and push customary and provided for
in such cases, might have put some money
aside to raise the rurb to the street rail
road track, which represents the old
srade of the street since It was accepted
by the city twenty years ago. Our Board
of Public "Works does not do such kind of
business. Their professional conscience
pot troubled by a doubt if that grade of
twenty years apro was the true on^. The
original grac!*> they claim to have be^n
two feet hltrher. They have given the
matter to the City and County Attorney,
who has pondered over it since some
months. He ponders still. Thence it will
pass to the courts and will rest there a
little while longer. Meanwhile nobody
could expect the board to reserve any
money for the improvement. Kverythinff
has been done that can be done and all In
a legal and professional manner. Should
the court decide that the original grade of
back in the fifties holds good, then the
board will propose to raise the level of
that afflicted block on Sixth street two
feet above the railroad track so that it
it like a "knpje" over the rest of the
world around it. For unfortunately dur
ing the generation that has passed since
the grade was lowered by two feet, a
whole densely populated square mile of
the city â that is. all the land between,
say. Howard and Channel and Third and
Tenth (probably morel â has been left two
feet below and has to be slowly educated
up to the level of our Board of Public
Works.
As the owners of the Sixth-street prop
erty will object to do business on a
"kopje." the board will once more express
its hearty regrets and the teams will drive
around the block, until a terrestrial or po
litical earthquake brings the board or
street to the proper lever.
One thing is certain, to-wit. that, since
these differences In the professional and
business levels have sprung up. there
floats again at the City Hall at half-mast
the familiar flag of the empty purse that
makes the honorable Board of Public
Works free from all further insinuations.
If it should ever be taken down, let the
board please remember that we on Sixth
street want to do business on a level with
our fellow men and that we are ready to
go up with them as soon as the million or
two are ready to raise the odd square
mile of city that lives now two feet be
low the law to the legal and professional
ievel. ROBERT R. RUSS.

DEWEY'S CANDIDACY.
ON" his return home last fall Admiral Dewey
found his countrymen in an idolatrous stage
of cffusi%-e feeling, and was immersed in an
atmosphere of popularity which was like incense.
But incense, though pungent and pleasant at tirst,
finally dulls" the nerves through which it is appre
ciated. The stage of satiety is reached, and though
the censer still swings and the perfumed clouds rise
from it, the aroma is unnoticed and the satiated
nerves turn to something new.
The Admiral seems to have reached that stage in
which the full soul loathes the honeycomb and turns
instinctively to something new.
Last fall, when the Presidential candidacy was pro
posed to him. he talked like a hearty sailor, declaring
that his life had been spent in his profession, out of
touch with civil affairs, and that the Government
could not be run like a man-of-war, and, as running
a ship was the limit of his knowledge, civil affairs
should be left to those trained in them.
Now his taste changes and his point of view shifts
with it. He accepts the idea which was repugnant to
him six months ago, and seems to hear his country
men calling him to the Presidency. Whatever sign
he may make, or what say or do, will not diminish
the kindly esteem in which he is held. But the state
ments in his assenting interview will not in any de
gree increase that esteem. When a man leaves a
pedestal to which he has been elevated by popular
acclaim, because of action in a specific line to which
training, experience or natural talent has directed
him. and seeks to climb upon another, in a far dif
ferent line, he comes to be judged -by an estimate not
of his right to stand upon the former eminence, but
of his fitness for the new one.
This is a high and mighty time in our history.
Great and novel questions are rising and growing to
overshadow the past. Party alignment is being re
arranged. Already there is apparent a new cleavag?,
but it is partisan. Men in great public station or
seeking it cannot keep their opinions dormant. The
people are not grabbing for a President in a bag. like
children at a church fair, nor are they playing blind
man's buff this year to catch the man who is to
serve them for four years in the great office. They
intend that the election next November shall decide
some things which wait for decision. They are in the
habit of adapting instrumentalities to their uses. An
American farmer does not use his daughter's piano
for a plow because he likes to hear "Yankee Doodle"
played on it. An American carpenter does not use
his wife's washboard for a jackplane because he ap
preciates the white linen she rubs clean on its ribs.
The American citizen does not send his watch to a
blacksmith to be cleaned, nor his horse to a jeweler
to be shod. He is skilled in self-government, and
wise in the adaptation of means to ends. He admires
Dewcy for what he is, but does not therefore feel
c; lied upon to admire him for something else.
This discrimination in selecting instrumentalities **
repressive of enthusiasm for the Admiral's Presidential
candidacy. A further bar is Dewey's lack of decision
as to the party whose candidate he would be and the
platform upon which he would run. He invites re
sentment by the apparent assumption that his person
ality is sufficient. We have not had many men in"
public life in all of our history whose personality
stood for that much. Indeed it is doubtful if we have
had any. Washington and Lincoln both had oppo
sition, and as for the others, they are all far away
from the ideal spot on which the Admiral seems to
believe he is standing.
His country will take hi? offer of himself with good
humor, but he mu?t not be disappointed if that humor
lack the eager enthusiasm which greeted him in his
proper character a few months ago.

The merchants of San Francisco are
suffering heavy loss from diversion of
trade through a sensational and untruth
ful report, emphasized by big type and
pictures, that the black plague had ob
tained a foothold in San Francisco. There
appears to have been no motive at all in
spreading this report other than one of
pure deviltry. It is an exaggerated case
of malicious mischief. It will hurt even
the newspaper that is guilty of it. but
that will not make good the injury to
Innocent and decent parties. "What to
do" is the question. To whereas and re
solve at public meetings will neither miti
gate the present situation nor guard
against a repetition of the offense that
produced it. Just what remedy is prac

FOR THE PROTECTION OF PATIENTS
SENATOR GALLINGER has introduced a bill
providing for the regulation of scientific ex
periments upon human beings in the District
of Columbia, the object being to put an end to cer
tain offenses to which the American Humane Society
has recently directed attention. It provides that no
person shall make or perform upon the body of any
human being within the limits of the District any
scientific experiment involving pain or risk of life or
health, for any other object than the amelioration of
the patient, except under the restrictions established
hv flip nrt
These restrictions are that the experiment be per
formed only by a duly qualified physician or sur
geon, that the subject of the experiment be not less
than twenty-one years of age and in full possession
of reasoning faculties, that the person making the
experiment obtain a license to make it from the
Commissioners of the District, that no such experi
ment be at any time continued against the expressed
will of the person experimented upon, and finally it
is provided: "That nothing in this act contained
shall be construed to prohibit or interfere with any
properly conducted method of medical treatment or
surgical operation, whether experimental or other
wise, having for its demonstrable end or object the
amelioration of suffering or the recovery of the pa
tient treated or operated upon."
The advocates of the measure claim it has no other
object th3n that of protecting those who cannot pro
tect themselves; that no reputable physician or
surgeon is affected by it, as it will not interfere in the
slightest degree with any method of treatment de
signed for the benefit of the patient, but that it "for
bids absolutely all experiments productive of pain or
distress or dangerous to life or health upon children
of any age, or the inmates of asylums, hospitals or
public institutions â in short, upon those who from
weakness or ignorance cannot protect themselves,
and whose helpless condition appeals to the common
instincts of humanity."
The Humane Society claims to have ample proof
of the necessity for restraining legislation of the kind
proposed. In these days, when an enthusiasm for
scientific .advance prevails in all civilized countries,
and when such large rewards of fame and fortune at
tend any notable discovery in science, the temptation
to make experiments upon human beings is inevit
ably great, and it is not to be doubted that in ! many
instances such experiments are made less with a view
to the good of the patient than for the discovery of
some secret of pathology. It is therefore advisable
that a safeguard be provided for the weak and the ig
norant against the excessive zeal of the devotees of
science, or the recklessness of quacks. The Gallingcr
bill applies only to the District of Columbia, but if it
prove efficacious and beneficial there, it may be fol
lowed elsewhere, and its consideration is therefore a
matter of interest to the country at large.

losses they will get their dander up and whip every
thing British in sight. Â«

"THE END OF HER LAST VOYAGE AS A SUGAR BOAT."
The brig W. G. Irwin Is now out about ten days from Honolulu, and on her arrival here will be turned over to her new
owners, Scammell & King, who will put her in the Nome passenger trade. She is perhaps the fastest vessel in the Hawaiian
"trade, and will in, "all probability make steamboat time to the gold fields.
â¢ A considerable portion of the Irwln'3 cargo for Nome will be a steam beer plant. The owners of the patent have
-put' ssooo into the venture and expect to make a fortune out of it. By a new process all the ingredients of a first class steam
? beer are reduced to a powder. When a keg of the thirst-quenching fluid is required a certain quantity of the extract is put
,into the barrel, the water is turned in and the compound allowed to stand an hour or so. At the end of that time the
( faucet is turned and out comes as fine a steam beer as was ever served on the water front.

The Mail steamer Australia got away
promptly on time for Honolulu yesterday.
Owing to the plague scare she took away
very few passengers, but there was a full
cargo of general merchandise. The ad
vent of the Mail boat will be anxiously
looked forward to in the islands as owing
to the quarantine supplies are getting
very short down there. <.
The cabin passengers wno sailed on the

wife. Mrs. M. Widdiueld, Miss Widdifleld.
Chief Justice A. F. Judd had to be car
ried aboard the steamer. He came to this
country for his health, but got worse in
stead of better. It is feared that he may
not live to reach Honolulu. The Judge is
accompanied by his wife, daughter and
son. Mrs. M. S. Levy is the wife of the
well known Rabbi. She is goinp to Hon
olulu to nurse her son. who was treated
as a plague suspect by the authorities
and sent to the Pesthouse. Later it
turned out that he had typhoid fever, and
the moving of him through the streets
in an ambulance nearly caused his death.
His mother will bring him home with her
when he is convalescent.
The arrival of another sugar fleet has
again made things lively at the quaran
tine station. The Planter was released
yesterday, and the cabin passengers of
the Sheridan were brought ashore, but
the fleet was almost doubled by the quar
antining of the barkentine Archer,
twenty-one days from Honolulu, ship
Falls of Clyde, fifteen days from Hilo,
schooner Dora Bluhm. eighteen and a
halfoays from Kahului and the schooner
Jennie "Wand sixteen days from Mahu

little kick at the plague scares ana their
accompanying ills. Captain Swanson 13

James Redmond; Arrested in
Manila, Now in the City
Prison Here.
To Be Taken to Kansas City to
Answer for the Murder of
Miss Emma Schu
macker.
Â«
James Redmond, alias Coleman. alias
Mlko Seville, alias William O'Neill, ac
cused of murdering- Miss Emma Schu
macker !r. Kansas City, Mo., on the night
of December S. 1F97. while robbing her
house, is In the City Prison awaiting the
arrival cf an officer from Kansas City
with the necessary papers for his extradi
tion. He was arrested in Manila by Cap
tain J. F. Morrison of the Twentieth In
fantry for personating a sergeant of ar
tillery and was identified by Lieutenant
Cobb of the Thirty-ninth In Jan try, for
merly a reporter in Kansas City; Alfred
O. Glrard, clerk In the chief surgeon's of
fice and formerly first sergeant of Troop
I of the Rough Riders, and others as the
Kansas City murderer.
Redmond arrived hero on the transport
Sheridan from Manila and was detained
at Alcatraz Island. Chief Sullivan had
been notified by Chief John Hayes of Kan
sas City that Redmond would arrive on
the transport. Chief Hayes requested
Chief Sullivan to take charge of the pris
oner until ho could send an officer for
him. Yesterday morning Detectives Rey
nolds, McMahon and Egan were sent to
the island by Captain Bohen for Redmond
and they brought him to the City Prison
yesterday afternoon.
His description, sent out by Chief Hayes
at the time of the murder, mentioned that
he had tattooed en his left forearm a
ballet girl with a sword in her hand, and
on the right forearm a tombstone, weep
ing willow, sailor and anchor. He had
ai?o a scar on the richt cheek from a
bullet tired by Miss Schumacker at him
before she was phot dead. Redmond de
nied that he was the right man, claiming
that his name was William O'Neill, but
he was examined in the prison and all
the marks referred to by Chief Hayes
were found on his person. The Chief also
said of him: "He is a burglar and would
steal lead pipe or blow a safe. He Is a
dope fiend and fond of women."
Redmond Joined the Rough Riders un
der the name of Mike Seville. After the
return of the regiment from Cuba and
while at Montauk Point. N. Y., he desert
ed, as he learned that the Kansas City of
ficers were on the way to take him back
there. He made his way to Seattle and
left there with the transport Garonne for
Manila in charge of some horses. He was
engaged as a teamster in the quartermas
ter's department in Manila when arrested.
Redmond positively refused to say any
thing except to deny that he was the man.
He said that he saw Wellington G. L.lew-

KANSAS CITY, April 4.â James Red
mond is wanted for the murder of Miss
Kmma Schumaker, in her grocery store
here on the night of December 8, 1597.
Two masked men entered Miss Schu
maker's store about &:oU o'clock that
night and demanded her money, which
flic was counting. Instead of giving up
her money Miss Schumaker drew a re
volver. One of the robbers promptly shot
her, the bullet passing through her body.
This did not weaken her, tor she imme
diately discharged her weapon at the man
who shot her. The robbers ran out of the
store and jumped into a buggy which they
had stationed near and drove away. Miss
Schumaker died a rew days afterward.
Bill Handy, an old negro living ln the
southeastern part of the city, told the
police that Kennedy, Kansas City's fa
mous train robber, who is now doing
nineteen years at Jefferson City for the
Macomb train robbery, brought a wound
ed man to the Rose House shortly after
the Schumaker shooting and that the
wounded man, who is declared to be Red
mond stayed there several days. It was
also believed that Kennedy and Redmond
had a hand in mis murder and that Red
mond was the man who was wounded by
Miss Schumaker. Kennedy was indicted
for the murder, but has never been tried
on the indictment. Shortly after the mur
ci.r Redmond left the city and detectives
have been on his trail ever since he joined
Torrey's Rough Riders at Rock Springs,
Wyo., and later went to Cuba. He was
recognized at Montauk, L. 1., after his
return from Cuba by a man from Kansas
City who visited the troops there. A de
tective was sent from Kansas City to ar
rest him, but he got wind of the affair
and made his escape. During the past
year nothing had been heard of him until
his arrest at Manila.
XIII. DANTE'S DIVINE COMEDY.
BY VIDA D. SCUDDER.
Dante's "Dlvino Comedy" belongs to a
great group of poems which may well be
studied together; symbolic or allegorical
poems, which toll us how noble imagina
tions have conceived of the spiritual his
tory of man. The book of Job Is one of the
first of these poems; in the renaissance.
Spenser's "Faerie Queene" Is the great
representative of the type. At the begin
ning of the modern era we meet Goethe's
"Faust" and Shelley's "Prometheus Un
bound." A little later, on a more limited
scale, but of the same order, Carlyle's
"Sartor Resartus." They have wonderful
Interest, these poems, and curiously
enough they reveal better than any real
istic literature the true character and
Ideals of the ages that produced them.
The fourteenth century was the only
period in which the "Divine Comedy
could have been written. The poem comes
right out of the heart of the middle ages,
but the middle ages old enough to have
become conscious, and, as so often hap
pens ln literary history, gaining power of
utterance Just as they pass away. The
accumulated passion and insight of many
Christian centuries are In the. poem.
The "Divine Comedy" is the story of a
pilgrimage. A little later, ln the renais
sance, Spenser showed us his conception
of earthly life, and his was a great battle
field, where knights of spiritual glory
fought forever against the forces of sin
and guile. Either conception Is true. J^ife
is a journey, it is also a battle; but a man
of the middle ages, which were even more
profoundly contemplative than militant,
was more likely to use the symbol of the
pilgrimage.
Into strange regions Dante's journey
took him. Tne poem is full of picture and
story, presented with marvelous vividness.
But this is because the middle ages had
an extraordinary gift for translating the
invisible into form and color. For ln real
ity all the landscape Is within the human
spirit. We are carried into hell, up the
purgatorial height and thence into the
glories of farthest heaven; and yet all the
time we have not left the limits of one
human, sinful, penitent, forgiven soul.
Hell first. Dante tell 3 us how he was
wandering, lost and beset by foes, ln the
wlldered forest of life, when there met
him a stately figure, who told him that he
was sent to be his guide. This was the
poet Virgil, representative of the wisdom
of the ancient world. It Is a heavenly one
who has sent Virgil to Dante's "help;
Beatrice, Dante's early love, now a saint
in paradise. Fearing, yet with an instant,
loving trust (which never fails him) In
Virgil, his noble master and lord, Dante
plunges into hellâ into the murk of hell.
Hell is within the earth. That is be
cause to Dante, as to all men of the mid
dle ages, this tarth seemed an evil thing,
which drew men away from God. It does
not fill the whole globe, it is only a coni
cal pit. clown which he stumbles, guided
by Virgil through the most varied and
terrible landscape ever conceived by man.
Now they press through a raging hurri
cane, on which wailing souls are borne
forever hither and thither; now across a
black marph, wherein are plunged the
souls of the wrathful and sullen, while
beyond loom the mosques of a city of fire;
now wander in a sinister land of tombs:
now in a horrible wood, where tortured
branches hiss and speak: now over burn
ing sands, whereon fall slowly, ceaseless
ly, dilated flakes of fire, and now they
wade a little river, the redness of which
makes Dante shudder â a river of Mood.
Downward they press, ever downward, to
the very center of the earth, where bit
ter cold reigns forever, where- Lucifer, the
evil worm. Is stuck, the central principle
of evil, death-giving, impotent.
All this hlde-ous region is full of agoniz
ing souls, whose place of abode, though It
appears material, is but the expression of
their evil minds. For behind the gro
tesque punishments which Dante devised
lies the inexorable fate of wicked charac
ter, nowhere else in Christian literature
rendered with so stern a power.
Some people talk as If Dante were only
the port of the "Inferno." and they pic
ture him as a gloomy, fearful person, se
vere and even vindictive. This Is not at
all true. Hell was. Dante had to go
there:
Christ! Once must every man descend to
depths of hell:
Ooest thou not ln life? In death there must
thou dwell.
Says an old German mystic. But Dante
was thankful enough to escape, and. once
out, his whole nature expands with an
exquisite tenderness. Nowhere ln litera
ture Is there so wonderful a sense of re
lief and escape as we feel when with Vir
gil and Dante we emerge from the "blind
world" into the sweet life-giving air and
watch the trembling of the dawn over the
ocean, from which rises toward heaven
the Mount of Purgatory. Hell was only a
very sr*ill part of Dante's universe. Just
as large was purgatory, and Its inhabi
tants continually were renewed, for the
pilgrim throng which he and Virgil now
join, mounting continually upward, re
joicing In tortures that purify and prom
ise, were constantly, their purification ac
complished, uplifted Into the supernal
bliss of the overarching heaven. It Is ln
tho earthly paradise, once the Garden of
Eden, on the top of this mighty moun
tain, that Dante's long trial is at an end..
Worthy of spiritual freedom, he is also
worthy at last to behold once more his
lady and his love â that Beatrice whom he
had early loved and early lost and
mourned through all his days. She comes
to htm. the light of heaven in her dear
eyes, and to heaven they uplift him. And
vast Indeed Is heaven; vast as the grace
of God. Hell Is only a segment of one
small globe. But Dante's heavens encir
cle this globe, sphere surrounding sphere,
out Into infinite space, all circled and
bounded by the boundless love of God.
If one is to believe ln hell at ajlâ of
course many people to-day refuse to be
lieve ln It â it is hard to see how one could
construe Its proportion in the universe
with more optimism than Dante. Here,
ln heaven, move, harmoniously free, the
GOLDEN /\GES OF* LITERATURE.
shining, singing spirits whpse earthly pil
grimage is over; no longer in human form,
but manifesting their bliss through love
ly light, color and movement. and
through speech and song more and more
fraught with spiritual rapture and wis
dom, as Dante pierces nearer to the heart
of the divine "light intellectual, full of
love: love of true good, full Of joy, Joy
whlrh transcends rvery sweetness"; that
Is what Dante found in the heavenly coun
try. He turns away at last even from
the eyes of Beatrice; turns to the contem
plation of the primal light. And in the
very conclusion of the j>Â«>em he reaches
in a flash the end of his journey, the goal
of his desires. It is the beatific vision, the
supreme longing of all devout souls in tho
middle ages, of all devout souls to-day.
Dante, who has beheld hell and, climbed,
the weary steps of purgatory, grazes at
last, his spirit unconsumed, upon the be
ing of God.

Selected Critical Studies.
The most obvious quality of Dante la
definlteness. This gives a peculiar char
acter to his sincerity, to his intensity and
to that wonderful faculty of vision for
which he Is unique among the poets of tha
world.
Dante's genius Is like a wedge of steel
hard, narrow, fit for rending oaks. Smit
ten with sledgehammer blows by his Ti
tanic energy it penetrates the toughest
matter and pierces to the very core of
things. The breadth of his thought Is less
remarkable than its depth. He goes
straight to the essence of his subject, re
jecting accidents, despising ornament,
and. having seized its truth, he grrasps
that with a grip of iron. Dante seems
ma.de to nullify the aphorism "not deep
the poet sees, but wide." he is so deter
mined to be dorp In insight and exact In,
detail that he limits his subject, if need
be. in order to secure the utmost deflnlte
ness. Nothing, again, can exceed the
brevity of his speech. His words are like
flowers and fruit 3 upon a tree of silence
âdefinite, precise, sincere. His pictures
are painted with the strictest parsimony
of description; yet no medal-striker ever
wrought his outlines sharper or his shad
ows deeper. The salient ami essential
points of an object are selected and made
visible with such vividness that we dis
cern tha whole. It would seem as If
each line of Dante's poem, each simile,
each aphorism, had been wrung from him.
with pain and struggle.â Slmonds.
But of all the great world poems un
questionably Dante's "Divina Commedla"
may be justly claimed to have a spiritual
sense, for it possesses a philosophic sys
tem and admits of allegorical interpreta
tion. It is pur excellence the religious
poem of the world. And religion. IlkÂ©
philosophy, deals directly with a first prin
ciple of the universe, while, like poetry,
it clothes Its universal ideas in thÂ» garb
of special events ar.ii situations, making
them types and hence symbols of the kind
which may become aliejjories.
Homer, too. shows us ihe religion of the
Greeks, but It Is an art religion, having
only the same aim as essential poetryâ to
turn the natural into a symbol of the spir
itual. Dante's theme Is the Christian re
ligion, which goes beyond the problem of
transfiguring nature and deals with the
far deeper problem of the salvation of
man. For man. as the summit of nature,
transfigures nature at the same time that
he attains the divine. The insight Into
the divine-human nature of the highest
principle of the universe and the conse
quent necessity of human immortality and
possibility of human growth into divine
perfection includes the Greek principle as
a subordinate phase. â W. T. Harris.
The â¢â¢Iliad" and the "Odyssey" do not
become antiquated to us. The characters
of Shakespeare are perpetually modern.
Homer, Dante. Shakespeare, siand alone
in the closeness of their relation to na
ture. Each after his own manner gives
us a view of life, as seen by the poetic
imagination, such as no other poet has
given to us. Homer, first of all poets,
shows us Individual personages sharply
defined, but in the early stages of intel
lectual and moral development, the first
representatives of the race at Its con
scious entrance upon the path of progress,
with simple motives, simple theories of
existence, simple and limited experience.
He is plain and direct in the presentation
of life, and in the substance no less than
in the expression of his thought.
In Shakespeare's work the Individual
man is no le^a sharply defined, no less
true to nature, but the long procession of
his personages is whonv different in effect
from that of the " iiiad" and the "Odys
sey." They have lost the simplicity of
the older race; they are products of a
longer and more varied experience; they
have become more complex. And Shakes
peare is plain and direct neither in the
substance of his thought nor ln the ex
pression oi It. The world has grown old
er, and in the evolution of his nature man
has become conscious of the Irreconcilable
paradoxes of life, and more or less aware
that, while he is infinite ln faculty, he Is
also the quintessence of dust. But there
13 one essential characteristic In which
Shakespeare and Homer resemble each
other as poetsâ that tney both show to us
the scene of life without the Interference
of their own personality. Each simply
holds the mirror up to nature and lets us
see the reflection without making: com
ment on the show. If there be a lesson
in it we must learn It for ourselves.
Dante comes between the two. and dif
fers more widely from each of them than
they from one another. They are primar
ily poets, He Is primarily a moralist who
is" also a poet. Of Homer the man and of
Shakespeare the man we know and need
to know nothing: it Is only with them aÂ»
poets that we are concerned. But it Is
needful to know Dante as man tn order
fully to appreciate him as poet. He jrfves
us his world, not as reflection from an
unconscious and Indifferent mirror, but as
from a mirror that shapes and orders Its
reflections for a definite end beyond that
of art and extraneous to it. And ln this
lies the secret of Dante's hold upon so
many and so various minds. He Is th<*
chief poet of man aa a moral being.â C.
E. Norton.

FACSIMILE OF THS POLICE DESCRIPTION OF BUJA,
THE filing of a suit Tuesday wherein
Mrs. Mary Buja seeks to recover
$1500 from L. Scatena, the commis
sion merchant of 104 Washington
street, recalls the crime of Nicholas Buja,
once the bookkeeper for the defendant ln
the action and son of the plaintiff.
Had Mr. Scatena been the hard-hearted
and designing man he Is alleged to be in
the complaint he would have allowed the
law to have taken Its course back in 1597.
when he discovered that Buja had robtjed
him of $3000. Instead he listened to the
appeals of a tearful mother and his re
ward for his kindness Is the suit in which
he is charged with extortion.
In the latter part of July, 1597, Scatena
discovered that his bookkeeper, Buja, had
gone wrong. The young man learned that
his employer suspected him, and to pre
vent an investigation of his accounts took
his books one night and dumped them Into
the bay. Ills act was witnessed by a
watchman, who recovered the documents
and returned them the following day to
Scatena. As the watchman entered the
front door Buja went out the rear and
fled. The police were notified and his pic
ture and description were sent all over
the State with the result that he was ar
rested and lodged in the City Prison.
While he was In Jail, unable to secure
bonds, the mother visited Scatena and
voluntarily offered to pay him J3OOO if he
would not prosecute her son. At first
Scatena refused to accept anything, but
Mrs. Buja was so persistent and became
such a nuisance about his store that he
finally acceded to her proposition. She
paid him $1500 in coin and gave a mort
gage on her property for the balance and
the son was released from prison. She
now seeks to repudiate her debt to Sca
tena and Â»eeks to impugn his motives in
the bargain. The mortgage fell due a
short time ago and Scatena was forced
to commence foreclosure proceedings.

WARNER'S REMEDIES.
THE WORD
Is Used to Cover a Multi-
tude of Diseases.
(NEW YORK JOURNAL. MARCH ir. iooo.)
"Nowadays the word 'Rheumatism' is used to cover a multitude
of diseases. They are all allied by the common bond of what the phy-
sicians call 'urk acid poisoning' â an excess of uric acid in the biood.
and are. penerally speaking, 'kidney troubles"â with the real cause of
danger not so much in the aches and pains (the signals of distress given
out by the muscles and joints) as in the gradual vitiation of the blood
by the failure of the kidneys to eliminate the deadly poison, called 'uric
ncid,' from the 'physical economy.' This vitiation of the blood results
in 'rheumatism' (although it is a vague word), and a variety of symp-
toms which not infrequently end in what is called B right's disease â the
disease of which James G. Blair.e. Mr. Cleveland's great political rival,
died. It is the disease which medical authorities say is becoming more
and more alarmingly prevalent in the United States of America, espe-
cially among the thinking, planning and writing classes â the classes
made up of the kind of men that it is the fashion to call distinctively
'brainy men.' "
From the reading of intel'igently edited papsrs, and from exam-
inations for life insurance, the great public is rapidly learainp; the fact
that the human system becomes thoroughly poisoned whin the kid-
neys fail to do the work nature intended them to do, and that if not
speedily cured rheumatism, heart disease, Bright's diseas : and dsath
surely fo'low. The kidneys, ani they alone, purify the blood. Ton-
ics and s:-callcd spring medicines prove costly and miserable failures.
There is one scientific, vegetable sprcific for all kidney troubles â War-
ner's Safe Curtâ a preparation with 21 years of succ;ss brhini it. A
positive cure fcr sick and tired-out kidneys. Not an experiment nor
a goad, but a soothing, harmlrss, yet conquering friend. Give it a
chance to-day to do you lasting good.

Chicago Livestock Market.
CHICAGO. April 4. â May corn opened He to
44jHc over Monday, at 39Htf40c. sold to 414 c.
the highest price since May. 1535, and closed
strong am', buoyant, I"Â»'ff2c Improved, at 41He.
Thfre was a clamor for July as well as May.
and contrary to recent practice, the shipping
bids followed the advance. There was profit
takint at times and some heavy pocketing of
losses by -horte. It was expected that offer
ings, which were light early, would be more
free over 40c, but the market passed that flg
ufe with its fractional additions' with scarcely
a tremor. There seemed to be no leadershipâ
Just a iAfc scramble for com. The news influ
ences were the Liverpool advance, serious dam
age by floods in Argentine and the usual coun
try offerings. At 4!c offerings for profit were
mure liberal and the price fell back to 40?Â»c,
but the market shot up again to 414 c, closing
shortly after this point was touched.
May pork opened I'Ciiioc over Monday, at $13Â®
13 30. sold to Jl3 4i. the highest price since 1594,
eased off on profit-taking to $13 10, and cloyed
4 r .c improved, at $13 20. Fluctuations in lard
and ribs were less wide. May lard closed 24c
up.
May ribs closed 27Â»ic better. As in corn, the
session was one of great activity and strength.
An advance in hogs of 20c since Monday, the
bullish showing of stocks and the upward trend
of corn were the main influences. There was a
heavy demand from commission houses and
packers and shorts were compelled to do a deal
of covering.
As a speculative market wheat broke Its own
record for a year, so those In the pit said. The
trade was excitedâ the pit crowded, but the
general feeling In the sufficiency of stocks to
meet all demands was such that the excitement
did not approach the wlldness apparent In corn
and provisions. May opened He higher, at f>lt 2
Cc67He, influenced hy higher cables of damages
to crous In 1-Yance. Largely tinder the influ
ence of the corn and provisions strencth the
market rallied to Cs,'ic. The bulge met proflt
taking and May eased back to 67^4c, but stead
ied and closed strong, Â»Â«SvÂ»c improved, at 6Sc.
St. Louis and the lucal talent were both short
and had to cover.
There was t)--e same experience in oats as in
the other marketsâ a seneral demand being
enouzh to overshadow all else. One hundred
thousand bushels were reported sold for ex
port. The strength In the neighboring pits was
the chief influence. May closed **Â©lc over
Monday.

In the markets here activity began to re
vive to-day, particularly In Americans. There
was a good ceneral tone, but the Eai>ter holi
days nre too near for a sustained movement.
Americans began bullish. Baltimore and
Ohio was below New York's Eensational parity,
but steadily Improved and 1% and {4 was given
for calls on Baltimore and Ohio to end in
May. There was a strong House tip to buy
Union Pacific and Northern Pacific. New
York continued Its buying In the afternoon,
raui>lnr a buoyant finish near the top. Lon
don followed this lead, but not very actively.
There was. however, a distinct Improvement.
Tlntos ecored a new record at 60c. Ana

Hides: "The wet salted market shows a better
demand, but no Improvement In prices. The
decline has been checked, but tanners, as a
rule, continue to buy sparingly. Dry Hides and
Calf show more activity and have sold freely
during the past week. There is a fair demand
and a steady market for Horse Hides. Deer
Skins come in freely from the north, northwest
anj Mexico and the demand is active, with
prospects for a well-sustained market. Goat
Skins sell readily. Tallow is steady, with a
fair demand."

Boston Wool Market,
BOSTON, April 4.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will Â»ay to-morrow: The wool
market continues dull. Some houses report a
little more looking around on the part of the
oonsumers, but there Is no improvement to
be noted in the actual demand and where
wool is sold to any extent It is generally at
concessions. Manufacturers as a class are In
need of wool. Nothing but favorable reports
are received from the goods market and if
the present demand keeps up most of the
trade are hopeful of a good business in the
wool market before long. Some of the more
impatient ones have, however, after waiting
three months for an active business resolved
to make business by letting their wools go at
Portland's Business.

GRAPE-NUTS CURE.
Good Food Works Salvation.
"When I began the use of Grape-Nuts
food for breakfast I was suffering with
nervous and stomach troubles. I found
that Grape-Nuts furnished a nourishing,
satisfying meal, that the stomach took
to it beautifully. I feel so much more
satisfied and well-fed after a meal of
Grape-Nuts and do not have that dis-
agreeable gorged and tight feeling in the
stomach which so often used to accom-
pany my meals when I was using other
foods.
"This proves to me that Grape-Nuts
food is highly condensed and nourish-
ing food, which satisfies the system as
no other food does, and causes no indi-
gestion. It is a godsend to all sufferers
of stomach and nervous troubles.
"I have several neighbors who are |
using both Postum Cereal Coffee and |
Grape-Xuts, and they wonder how they
ever did without either, since learning
how good and beneficial they are. One
lady has a family of growing school
children. She says they use nothing
else for their luncheon at noon but
Grape-Nuts with milk. They all enjoy
the food very much and feel well fed.
She states that when the children come
in from school they are not starved for
a piece of something to eat, as they for-
merly were when they lunched from all
other foods.
"This has convinced her that Grape-
Nuts food sustains the system longer
than any other food. The fact that it is
thoroughly cooked and ready for imme-
diate serving is of great value, especially
when one is in a hurry. Please do not
publish my name." The name of this
lady can be had by application to the
Postum Cereal Co., Ltd., Battle Creek.

GRIFFIN KNOCKS LAWLER
OUT IN THE THIRD ROUND
OAKLAND, April 4.â Charles Lawler of
Detroit, widely advertised as the "unde
feated," collided with the right fist of
"Hank" Griffin, the colored scrapper from
Los Angeles, at the Reliance Athletic
Club rooms this evening, and five minutes
afterward came to a realization of the
fact that he had been up against the real
thing. The knockout blow was a right
swing on the jaw in the third round of
what was to have been a ten-round con
test, and came bo suddenly that the spec
tators were taken by surprise. Lawler
dropped like a log. He. tried to rise to
his feet as the eighth second was ticked
off, but fell back and had to be carrier to
his corner by his seconds.
The first two rounds were spent In fid
dling at long distance and only one light
: tap was landed by each man before the
end came. Lawler was seconded by Tom
Tracy, R. S. Cole and George Croll. Grif-
Jin was seconded by Tom Sadler, Watson
Burns, Frank Malley and a brother of
"Soldbr" Green. . Jack Kitchen officiated
as referee. Prior to the battle Charles
Long announced that Fred Russell chal
lenged the winner.
The first preliminary between "Jockey"
Maynard of Oakland and "Kid" Shon
brien of San Francisco proved a rather
tame affair, and was stopped in the fourth
round and the laurels awarded to May
nard by the referee.
The real fight of the evening was the
second preliminary, in which Jack Cape-
Jlss of the Reliance Club defeated Charles
Trost of San Francisco in the seventh
round of what was f-cheduled for a ten
round "go." Both men went at each
other like tigers, Trost having somewhat,
the advantage until the third round, when
he was considerably weakened by a se
ries of stiff body blows. Both men were
groggy on several occasions, but Capeliss
showed the greater recuperative power
and had Trost all but out in the seventh
round, when Referee James Fox stopped
hostilities and declared Capeliss the win
ner. After the contest It was discovered
that Capeliss had broken his right hand.
Though this accident occurred in the sec
ond round he had not even notified his
seconds, but fought gamely with his left
hand and won a most creditable victory.
The action of Referee James Fox in stop
ping both preliminaries when they became
one-sided Is generally commended.

mittee composed of Charles M. Plum.
Charles Taussig and E. P. Irving, which
reported in the matter at a meeting of
the board of directors on Tuesday. P. J.
Healey. who preferred the charges, was
dissatisfied with the verdict and spoke in

etc., which he made against the librarian.
The directors also decided to spend double
the sum heretofore used in the purchase
of books. A box will be placed in the
library and members are requested to drop
into the box any suggestions as to the
management of the Institute and they will
be acted upon by a special committee.

STATESMEN INCLINED
TO CENSURE DEWEY
WASHINGTON. April 4.-Senator Han
na said respecting Dewey's candidacy
that it "ought to have been announced on
April Iâ April fool's day." That wus all
j Mr. Hanna would say about it.
None of the officials of the Navy De
| puxtment cared to express publicly any
opinion as to the admiral's Presidential
announcement. But it was plain to be seen
that It. had created profound surprise in
every circle. The Impression prevailed
that, regardless of the outcome of the ad
miral's movement from a political point
of view, his entrance into the arena of
politics marks the termination of his ac
tivity in the navy. Not that it is be
lieved that his retirement is pending, but
it is felt that, engrossed as he will be in
his other aspirations, the admiral will not
be able to spare the time necessary for
the discharge of purely naval duties. It
is intimated that he practically indicated
his purpose to withuraw from active naval
work in a conversation recently with an
Intimate friend and brother officer.
Senator Proctor of Vermont to-night,
speaking of Admiral Dewey's announce
ment saJd: "The statement in regard to
the Presidency purporting to come from
Admiral Dewey is as much of a surprise
to me as it can be to any one. The sub
ject of politics has not been referred to
between us In the slightest manner, di
rectly or indirectly, since his statement
soon after his return last fall."
Here is what pome Californians think
of Dewey's candidacy:
Representative De Vrlesâ l do not se
riously regard the candidacy of any man
who has no platform upon Important mat
ters. â¢
Representative Watersâ lf the Dewey
interview is correct and he states that
he is a candidate, but unwilling to state
of what party, then I should say he
ought to have a political guardian ap
pointed immediately.
Representative Kahnâ l feel satisfied
that Dewey stands aosolutely no chance
for nomination by either party.
Representative Barbamâ l don't believft
Dewey ever made that statement, but if
he did he has held the last official posi
tion he ever ought to hold In this world.
Representative Needhamâ His candi
dacy makes no difference with the two
great national conventions. The Republi
cans will nominate McKinley, the Demo
crats will nominate Bryan, and McKinley
will be elected.
OMAHA, Nebr., April 4. â The announce
ment of the Presidential candidacy of Ad
miral Dewey has created a tremendous
sensation throughout this section of the
West. Bryan's friends are considerably
exercised. The Gold Democrats are very
much elated with affairs, as are leading
Republicans. They claim the situation
is very much complicated and that Bryan
will have trouble disposing of Dewey, as
there will be a spontaneous outburst in
behalf of the hero of Manila Bay. Na
tional Democratic Committeeman Thomp
son this afternoon asserted that the can
didacy of Dewey meant nothing and that
nothing could head off Bryan; Nebraska
was still for him and would remain so
even though every other State were for
Dewey.
J. Sterling Morton. ex-Secretary of Agri
culture and the leading spirit of the gold
Democratic party in the State, thinks
Dewey will prove a very disturbing factor
in the Bryan camp. So does Euclid Mar
tin, for years chairman of the gold Dem
ocratic State Committee.
The Omaha World-Herald takes the po
sition that Dewey Is not right on the ques
tion of Imperialism for the Democratic
Convention to make him a formidable
candidate, and that he cannot be seriously
considered by the Democrats because
anti-imperialism will be the cardinal prin
ciple or the coming campaign. The Bee
editorially says the De.wey boom is liable
to prove a serious thing for Bryan in view
of the prominence of the movement in the
East. All the small dailies throughout
the State give the announcement of
Dewey's candidacy under scare heads and
say Dewey will have a big following.
DETROIT, April 4.â Daniel J. Campau,
Michigan member of the National Demo
cratic Committee, wires the New York
World to-day In response to an Inquiry
whether Dewey would not be a stronger
candidate than Bryan as follows:
"In the present crisis the Democratic
party needs a leader of positive convic
tion. The Democratic candidate must not
only stand firmly upon the Democratic
platform but must be a platform in him
self. Mere personal popularity Is never
sufficient to win, especially at a time when
voters are studying, as now. The Demo
cratic party is strongest when fighting
aggressively for principle, and weakest
when supporting mere popular heroes.
Proud as Democrats may be that Dewey
is among those who desire the downfall
of Imperialism, I think It would be a grave
mistake not to place in nomination Wil
liam J. Bryan, whose vote of 18% was
larger than had ever been before required
to elect, and whose following to-day ia
larger by far."
HILLÂ»SBORO, Or.. April 4.â Regarding
Dewey'a candidacy for President Hon. W.
J. Bryan declines to be interviewed.
LOSING OF A CORPSE
WRECKS HIS MIND
Stockton Man Becomes Insane While

i Bpcda] Dispatch to The Call.
BINGHAMTON. N. V., April 4.-M. N.
I Beach of Stockton. Cal., is insane at Nor
j wich as the result of losing a corpse he
; was conveying from Stockton to Oly

|at the Palmer House. He acied strangely
j and said that while <-scorting the body of
| Mrs. Hill from Stockton to Olyphant ht>

searching for the corpse, and was locked
up by the Sheriff. In his cell he rayed

! culty in restraining him. Relatives at
j Stockton, whose address was found among

The body which went astray later ar
rived safely at Olyphant. This, when
communicated to the patient, had a quiet
ing effect, and it is thought he will soon
recover. He is said to be a prominent and
weaJthv resident of Stockton.
EMPLOYES DISMISSED
BY THE HEALTH BOARD
Dr. Bazet's Plans for Central Disin
fecting Station Approved and
May Be Carried Out.
The Board of Health held a special
meeting yesterday and decided to sustain
Health Officer O'lirien in Lis summary
removal of Steward Reilly and Day
Watchman Wollard from the Twenty
sixth-strcet StnaJlpox Hospital. Dr.
O'Brien said his action In the case of
Reilly and Wollard was the result of a.n
aflidavit liled by Thomas Powell regard
ing the conduct* of the dismissed officials.
Powell in his affidavit stated that there
was a case of smallpox la?t March at his
house, luti Taylor strt-t-t, and Reilly and
Wollard came with the ambulance to re
move the patient to the hospital. Reilly
drew a revolver and said that ho had
heard there was going to be trouble. He
then said that everytning would be taken
out of the room and burned, but .told
Powell that if he was "wise" and "next
to himself" he knew what to do. Powell
says he then gave Reilly a dollar, and
Reilly and Wollard brought the bedding
into the kitchen, but took nothing away
with them except a part of the patients
clothes and a grip belonging to him.
J. P. Keating and B. Walls were ap
pointed to succeed Reilly and Wollard.
and T. Cullnnden succeeds P. McMillan
as night watchman.
Attorney Bennett; for the Chinese Con
sul, addressed the board regarding thÂ«?
suppression of basement lodging houses
In Chinatown, saying that the enforce
ment of the order would work a hardship
on the poorer class. The board was of the
opinion that the order should be carried
out to its strict letter and will prosecute
its work in that direction.
C. H. Mills, M.D.. was appointed an in
terne of the City and County Hospital,
vice Dr. A. Glroux, resigned.
Dr. Bazct read a paper regarding the es
tablishment of a central disinfection sta
tion similar to the one now successfully
operated In Paris. On motion of Dr.
Baum the plans and .specifications for a
local station as outlined by Dr. Bazet
were approved and the Supervisors will bo
requested to set aside sufficient funds to
carry out the suggf-stion.

PORTO RICAN LABORER
PERMITTED TO LAND
Secretary Gage Passes Upon a Test
Case Involving the Status of
the Island.
WASHINGTON. April 4.â Secretary
Gage to-day passed on the case of Jorge
Cruse, a native of Porto Rico, who was
dt-tained at Ellis Island, N. V., and or
dered deported on the charge that he had
violated the contract labor laws. In his
telegram to the Commissioner of Immi
gration at New York Secretary Gage
says:
You will allow Jorge Cruse to land, the de
partment reserving tlw right to deport him at
any time within one year and to bring suit for
$1000 penalty Â» gainst the person or corpora
tion asutsUng, encouraging or soliciting him to
come under contract. It appears that Cruse
came without knowledge that he was in viola
tion of the law. If he be here In violation of
law. It further appears that he waa brought
here to make a moot case and not In good
faith, as a contract laborer. This being an
Isolated case, public interests are not affected
by allowing him to land subject to future de
portation. Legislation now pending In Con
gress may change the present status. The de
partment prefers to test the question by bring
ing suit to recover penalty Imposed by law
upon the person who brought CrUse Into this
country under contract. The matter will be re
ferred to the Department of Justice with a re
quest to take such action In this direction as
the case may justify/
COUNT DE LUBERSAC
ENGAGES IN A DUEL
Victorious in the First Affair Result
ing From His Quarrel With
the Rothschilds.
PARIS, April 4.â lt Is reported that the
first of the series of duels arising from
the Count of Lubersac's letter to Baron
Robert Rothschild took place this after
noon between Baron Michael Ephrussl
and the Count of Lubersac, on the island
of Grande Jatte, in the Ri%'er Seine, near
Keuilly. At the fourth onslaught the Baron
was wounded in the breast, the count's
sword striking a rib.
The count received a slight scratch In
the neck. M. Ephrussl's seconds wero
MM. Tavernlere and Blestagana, The
count, it Is said, found difficulty In secur
ing seconds, owing to the question of ar
bitration which the count's previous sec
onds thought necessary and he was
obliged to ask the assistance of two non
commissioned officers belonging to his old
regiment. They are gendarmes and wear
the military medal for valor.
The duel took place in the rustic danc
ing hall, which was the scene of the notor
ious encounter between Marquis de Mores
and the Jewish Captain Meyer, in which
the latter fell an easy victim. Quite a
crowd had got wind of the meeting and
was assembled in the grounds. The count
attacked vigorously from the outset and
the combatants parted at the finish with
out the customary handshaking.
The count left the scene in a landau and
was greeted with cries of "A bas les
Juifs," and "VJve l'Armee."

FROM AMBUSH
BY OUTLAWS
Walked Into a Trap Set by
a Gang of Arizona
Cattle Thieves.
George A. Scarborough, Who Has
Been a Terror to ths Criminals,
Severely Woundsd and Will
Probably Die.
o
PHOENIX, Ariz., April 4.â A special to
the Republican from .Benson, Ariz., says:
sTe?terday afternoon about 2 o'clock while
pursuing an unknown gang of cattle
thieves, George A. Scarborough of Dem
ing, who has been a terror to lawbreakers
in New Mexico and Arizona for many
years, accompanied by Wait Birchfield, a
Deputy Sheriff, was ambushed by the
outlaws In the Chirucusa Mountains and
both were wounded, Scarborough se
riously and Birchileld painfully. The out
laws in some way discovered that they
were being followed and laid a trap for
the officers, who walked into It.
As soon as they came within rifle range
the party of three bandits opened rire.
The first volley wounded both Scarbor
ough and Birchfield, one shot striking
Scarborough In the leg, shattering the
bone, another struck Birchneld In the
left arm. Both men are disabled. The
wounded officers held the outlaws at
bay, although hard pressed several times.
A continuous firing was kept up until
dark.
In the meantime Birchfield managed to
build a rude rock fort. In which he placed
Scarborough, and as soon as darkness pre
vented his movements from being ob
served by the bandits he slipped away,
secured a horse and went for assistance.
Returning at daybreak he found Scar
borough still alive and holding the fort,
but suffering intense pain from his wound
and exposure, it having rained and snowed
all through the night. The party arrived
at San Simon at 2 o'clock this afternoon
with Scarborough, and he was sent to his
home in Deming. Ills wound will prob
ably prove fatal.
A large posse has started in pursuit of
the outlaws, who have evidently gone
farther back in the mountains, where it
will be almost impossible to dislodge
them.

OF LAMPHREY
Prison Directors Say That
Good Cause for Removal
Must Be Shown.

Mentioned.

Si>eclal Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, April 4.â The dismissal
of George E. Lamphrey from hl.-i position
as lieutenant of the guard fit* Folsom
Prison without any assigned reason ha*
created much unfavorable commenl
among Republicans here. State Prison
Director R. T. Devlin, a member with
Director Wilklns of the present Republi
can minority of the board, announces his
determination to inquire at the next meet-
Ing of the board into the cause of Lieu
tenant Lnmphrey's discharge. Lamphrey
Is a Rt'publlcan, and Warden Wilkinson
and a majority of the Hoard of Directors
are Democrats.
Although the late Warden Charles Aull
was a stanch Democrat, he reposed the
utmost confidence in Lamphrey and in
Captain R. J. Murphy, another Republi
can, and to them he often credited a large
share of the success of the prison m:v!\
agement. Friends of Captain Murphy,
who, by the way. received the votes of
the two Republican directors for Warden,
assert that It would not surprise them If
his head next dn>r>s into the basket.
Said Director Devlin to-day: "If Lam
phrey was able to hold his office on hta
merits during the- Democratic adminis
tration of Governor Itudd, I confess I am
greatly surprised to see that since Cap
tain Aull's death it has been found under
a Republican administration that he is
unfit to hold his position. Immedlately
upon learning that Lamphrey had been
discharged 1 went for him, and while he
does not wish to go back to the prison
under existing circumstances. I feel it a
duty I owe to him as a prison official and
to the State's service as well to ascertain
the causes that lead to his removal. If
Warden Wilkinson was justified In remov
ing him on account of any misconduct of
Lamphrey I have not a word to say and
shall heartily approve his act; If, on the
contrary. Lamphrey was removed through
pique or malice or for political purposes,
I propose to Inquire into the matter vig
orously.
"This is a matter that does not concern
Lamphrey alone, because we have at Fol
som prison some of the most hardened
criminals in the country. They have
made several attempts to escape from
prison and It is only because they hav>Â»
had to cope with efficient and brave oA
cers that their outbreaks were not suc
cessful; but if the prison Is to be demoral
ized by removing good men and person*
with Inadequate experience are to be put
In their places the prison will soon become
unmanageable and outbreaks that will
lead to great loss of life will Inevitably
follow."
There is a likelihood that a meeting of
the Board of Prison Directors will be
held with the State Board of Examiner*
in this city in a few days, when the sub
ject of the Folsom prison management

P. A . BUELL WHO DIED AT â¢ THE GRAND HOTEL
ago, when the candidates for Congress
were mentioned, he .was named- as the
leader of his district. He refused to run
for the position, however, on account of
the press of business duties.. Even at this
early date his name was mentioned as the
most likely nominee for the next Congres
sional election.
Mr. Buell left a widow and two children.
Three brothers. G. A. and-R. I. Buell,
residing in Stockton, and .Seymour Buell,
who lives In the East, and a sister, Mrs.
Ely. whose home is In Washington, also
survive him. â Â¦
The death of Mr. Buell was probably
due to uric acid poisoning. Early in the
evening he -was, forced to take to his bed
and was attended, by Dr. J. I. Stephens.
His last message was to an old friend,
Arthur Lovlnsky of Stockton, to whom he
wrote the folio wing: letter:

PA. BUELL. one of the most prom
inent business men of Stockton
and Intimately associated with all
Â° progressive movements in the San
Joaquin Valley, died suddenly last night
at the Grand Hotel. Mr. Buell was In this
city for business purposes, and his sud
den death will come as a shock to his
many friends, who are numbered by the
score.
Mr. Buell was the president of the P. A.
Buell Lumber and Planing Mills, one of
the biggest establishments of its kind In
the State. He was also president of tho
Stockton Commercial Association and the
San Joaquin Valley Association, formed
for the advancement of the Interests of
the San Joaquin Valley. As a public
spirited citizen Mr. Buell did not have his
superior in Stockton. Every .progressive
movement suggested or attempted was
sure to find him associated in Its behalf.
When the. project to build the San 'Joa
quin Valley Railroad was floated he was
one of Its most ardent supporters. His
popularity knew no bounds, and two years

This is the great factor which prevents
thÂ«* r-xtension of Pacific Coast trade. ) In
the immediate vicinity of San Francisco
the coast Jobbers have a slight advantage
and this is what the St. Louis people are
flsrhting- to wipe out. For example, a San
Francisco wholes;Uer can bring his goods
to San Francisco at the carload rate of
$1 7.1 and rethip them' to Fresno for 50
cents, making a total freight charge, of
12 20. The best the St. Louis wholesaler
can do, sending his goods by less-than
f arload rate to terminal points, of which
Fresno Is one. Is $2 50, giving the San
Francisco jobber slightly the best of It.
Julius Kruttschnltt of the Southern Pa
cific Company asserted positively that the
cost of handling less-than-carload lots of
freight was fully 50 per cent more than
carload shipments.
How the Railroad Calculates.
"The difference In cost to the company
between carload and less than carload
business is far greater than the differen
tials." s;iid Mr. Kruttscnitt. "The cost of
operating a railroad on the Pacific Coast
is far higher than in any other section of
the country. This is due chiefly to the
difference in price of labor, material and
fuel.

the differentials would have on the whole-

Some tricks of unscrupulous shippers
were explained by J. H. McCabe, a local
freight inspector for the Transcontinental
Freight Association. Cutlery was sent
from St. Louis billed as hardware to get
the benefit of the rate on the latter class,
which Is much the lowest. Whenever
these cases are discovered the correct rate
Is charged. By his own efforts in that
line McCabe claimed to have collected for
the Freight Association over $40,000 addi
tional freight charges during the past
year.

ITnlori Tnist building. Directors
Kruttschnltt 'and Ptubbs were retired
to makf room on the board for
m--n representing Eastern interests. \V.
K. DcdÂ»je, E. H. Pardee and Frank Foster
were also retired from the board. The
five new directors are: John K. Searle*.
tors follows the meeting of stockholders,
but this year there is not a quorum in
town, and no one can say when the meet
ing of the directors will be held; it may
be held in New York.
The retirement of Kruttschnltt and
Stubbs from the board of directors was
merely for the purpose of giving the
heavy Eastern stockholders a fuller rep
resentation. Both gentlemen will retain
their positions in the company, as vice
presidents. So far as can be learned no
heads in any department have been mark-
Ed for the official ax. All of the officials
feel secure in their positions.
Huntlngton's private secretary gave out
to the reporters only the names of the
new directors. If there were any reports
and communications, he said nothing of
them. The public was left to surmise
what the meaning of the changes in the
board mean.
To-day President Huntington will meet
the grievance committees of the railroad
brotherhoods to discuss his famous relief
department scheme.
