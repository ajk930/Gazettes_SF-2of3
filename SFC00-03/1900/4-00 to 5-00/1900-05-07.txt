RABBI HERTZ DECLARES THE
TRANSVAAL IS AN OLIGARCHY
. ...; ;Â¦Â¦; -I >
NEWv YORK. - May 6.â Dr. Joseph H. Hertz, who was rabbi of the Wlt
watersrand Hebrew Congregational Church of Johannesburg until last
December, when he was expelled from the -Transvaal by President
Kruger, arrived here on the steamer Etruria to-day.
VI went to the Transvaal a strong pro-Boer," said he. "and I spoke
on many a public occasion In favor of the Transvaal Government, but an In
sight Into the Transvaal methods and an acquaintance with the leading offi
cials within the .Transvaal and the Free State, as well as my personal ex
perience while trying to remove the obnoxious religious disabilities under
which the Catholics and the Jews suffer, gradually compelled me to see that
the Transvaal Is not a republic, but rather an oligarchy, , mlsgoverried on
strictly mediaeval* principles.
"At'the" Ultlander meeting at Johannesberg on July tS. 1S3S, I uttered
these words: 'Let President Kruger demand of the Catholic Inhabitant, of
the Jewish inhabitant, of the State, everything -he has a rlsht to demand of
his own burghers. We would give up everything. Willingly, joyfully, would
we sacrifice everything with the exception of our faith, our principles, our
ttruth and our honor, and, we will not sacrifice our fallh and our honor, be
cause the heroes of Holland and the sturdy men who have presided at the
birth of this republic have not taught â us that by sacriflcing those (hings we
would become worthy members <of the Transvaal republic*

draw It. I refused, and although an American citizen, I was expelled."
Postoffice Department's Report on
Alleged Cheating in the Weigh
ing of Mail.
WASHINGTON, May 6.â In reply to an
Inquiry from .Chairman Loud of the
House Postofflce Committee the Second
Assistant Postmaster General has sent
him a letter relative to a fraud alleged to
have been practiced in connection with
the weighing of the mails in ISM and to
the general subject of the possibility of
such attempted frauds becoming: effective.
The compensation received by railroad
companies for carrying the malls is de
termined by the character of the service
performed, the facilities furnished and
the average daily weight of mail carried.
Special reference Is made to Mr. Freech
tig. who, in 1SD8. claimed to have knowl
edge of frauds In connection with mall
weighing. He was requested to furnish
information that would enable the depart
ment to locate the route and persons in
volved. The Information desired was not
then disclosed by Freechtig.^ Later, on
November 2. 1839. Freechtig submitted an
affidavit and a letter, in which the only
specific allegation that could be used by
the department was that he participated
In an attempt to Illegitimately Increase
the weight of the mails passing. over a
Colorado route. ThÂ© 250 pounds, of mail,
if sent as claimed, when reduced to a
daily average, says the letter, could have
no effect on the compensations. His claim
that the Government was defrauded, in
the sum of ten million dollars a year by
the effect of frauds in weighing Is char
acterized as extravagant and entirely
groundless. In conclusion It Is stated that
Freechtig did not give any Information
to sustain his claim, although he was as
sured that the department was anxious
to obtain evidence of any such fact.

FAILED TO "OBTAIN
EVIDENCE OF FRAUD
VET RIVER. May 6.â Yesterday the
nritish. after a long march, encountered
the Boers holding Vet River with, six guns,
two being of long range. An artil'ery
duel ensued.
General Pole-Carew started at daybreak
yesterday on a nineteen mile inarch. He
first came in contact with Boers holding
the river at 1 o f clock p. m. The British
poor, had two batteres In action and later
added two navai nine-pounders and
two five-Inch siege guns.
The Boers fired with great accuracy and
the duel continued unabated "with a terri
ble din, until sunset, and even later there
was a desultory flrir.fr. It is marvelous
that nobody on the British Hide was In
jured.
General Hutton started early to find the
drift on the west. When this was discov-

extracted them from the bodies of two dead
Boers.
Numerous have been the Instances of British
cruelty In the battlefields of South Africa, such
as the abuse of the white flae and the flrlns'

parallel In modern warfare.

said that ceveral priests were implicated. The ringleaders were arrested and

Â¦were wealthy. "When he became of age he was, concerned in revolutionary
schemes which failed. Then he went to Panama. He was a leading figure In
several other revolutions, and in 1878 he was banished from Ecuador. He re
turned in 1S79 and participated In another revolution. He was captured and
sent to prison. Upon being pet free General Alfaro went to Panama., After
having led several other revolutionary, movements he finally triumphed and
entered Quito in September, 1S35. He was elected President, and in 1838. he

OF BARBAROUS WARFARE
According to a dispatch to the Dally

-?
LONDON', May 7.â The troops which I

quarters around Bloemfontein a j
few days ago have taken a great ;
eprir.g forward, which has brought j
Them almost at a single bound at least Â¦
within striking distance of V.'inburs:. if '
rot already within Its grates. The Boers :
were forced to evacuate their positions a; j
Brandfort without making serious effort !
to hold them, and on Saturday evening i
Lord Roberts reported that he himself \
had reached Vet River, a few miles south- j
e-ast of Winburg, on the main road from ;
Bloemfomeln. The passage was stoutly >
contested for eome hours, but toward j
fiusk General Hutton and his mounted in- '
fantry turned the ripht flank of the enemy i
Â«nd forced their way across the river in !
the face of a heavy fire.
Meanwhile smart fighting had been go
fng on along practically the whole widely
extended British front ranks. General
Hamilton, who It will be remembered
foupht his way north from Thaba Nchu,
thrust himself between two Boer com
mandos that were endeavoring to join
forces. The Household Cavalry. Twelfth
Lancers and Kitchener's Horso had the
polden opportunity for whioh they have l
l^rig waited cf charging a body of Boers
in the oi'on. Such chances have been
few in this company. Those Boers who
UU lived this flrst lesson In the shock of j
nrtion of the British cavalry broke and
fled, leaving a number of dead and
uuuuflcd on the ground. General Hamil
ton v.as able to push on toward a drift
on the Little Vet River, which Is de
prrib< d by Lord Roberts as difficult, and It
is clear that this force was acting: as the
r-xtrerr.p ripht win?: of the British army.
General Macdonald's brigade, which was
nhso a/ting on the right, dislodged the
Boers from a group of kopjes under cover
cf the naval puns.
Of eiual Interest is the news which
come? of General Hunter's operations on
the extreme left He crossed Vaal River
at WirxiFortori on Friday, and pushing 1
ahead found ;he Boers in strength near
Rlndam:
The brunt of the fighting fell on General

A Boer account of the capture of Brand
fort saj-s: 'The Federal forces, although
weak in numbers, offered strong resist

General Hunter's progress, although
slow, is satisfactory. The idea that the
relief of Maf eking Is in sight, however,
appears -to have been premature, as the
Boers in th;:t quarter are still stoutly re-

but General Ilutton pushed forward to a

terribly hot. Later the whole British force
crossed the river, threatening the Boer
right.
The Doers must have received about the
same time r.ews of General Hamilton's
occupation of Winburg. .
About sunset a detachment of twenty
six Australians, who had crept un

After firing they fixed bayonets and

The British losses were five killed and
twenty-flve wounded, mostly Welsh Fu

which they allowed to return. The Boers,
In their hurry left thirteen dead.

ROBERTS CONTINUES TO
DRIVE BACK BOERS
FROM KOPJES.
NEW YORK, May 6.-A fire that
started at the river end of the
Mallory Line Steamship pier jit,
the foot of aiaidenlane and the
Kast River early this morning
completely destroyed the pier and Its
valuable contents. The" police place the
loss at $1,000,000. Several barges v.h'.ch
were moored near tlte pier were also de
stroyed and many rescues of their cap
tains and cf the members of the families
on board were made. One life was lost.
The nine-month-old daughter of Captain
Charles Lochs of the barge Sherwood was
drowned.
The Mallory line pier was 200 feet Ions
and 60 feet wide. /The pier was filled with
valuable freight, mostly cotton. On the
north side of the pier were moored a
number of coal and cotton barges, while
on the south side was the steamer San
Marcos and a number of barges.
No sooner had the work of fighting the
flames begun than the firemen turned
their attention to saving the lives of
those on the barges which were lying
within the line of danger. Nearest to the
pier was the barge Stephen B. Elklns.
Her captain. Frank Ford, and his wife,
his three-month-old daughter and a baby
were on board and sleeping. A skid was
quickly run from the pier to the coal
barge, the occupants of the boat were
awakened and were hurried from their
bunks to a place of â¢ safety before the
flames had them.
On board the barge Sherwood were
Charles LQchs, the captain, 38 years. old:
his wife. lienna, 30 years old. and their
daughter, Rosie, 9 months old.
.The Lochs family was awakened by the
flames. Their barge was already on flre
at the time that they were aroused from
sleep. . The father took the nine-month
old baby in his arms, and with his wife
jumped into the water. Timothy Boyle,
formerly in command of the barge New
Brunswick, whose home is at Rondout,
N. Y.. plunged In to save the woman,
who _had become exhausted. Her hus
band, who still held the baby in his arms,
saw that his wife was on the point of
going down. It ( became a question to him
as to which he should save, his wife or
baby. He therefore let the baby go in the
hope that she would be picked up by some
one else and went to the assistance of his
wife. He managed to hold her head above
water, until Boyle reached . v iem. All three

lay alongside the other burning bonres.
were the captain. Joseph Plumb, his wifa
and two children. All -were rescued by
the police. Patrolman Jeremiah Cronln
was badly burned v/hi!o taking one oÂ«
the children ashore. All hands on board
the lighter Â¦ Arno got ashore safely.
Michael SheMcn,of that boat was com
pelled to jump Into the river, from whicli
lie was rescued.
: Three large vessels were lying: so near
the blazing p!er rhat their safety was en
dangered. They were the steamer San
Marcos and the steamer Neucea, which
were towed out Into midstream, and the
bark St. James, the rigging of which was
burned before she" could be got out of
harm's vay.
The scene on the water was a most ex
citing one. The river was filled with
steamer craft engaged in towing the va
rious vessels and barges .to places of
safety. Four cotton barges, others laden
Â¦with cornmeal and some loaded with coal
caught flre and were destroyed. Some of
them were also sunk to prevent the fur
ther spread of the flames.
A number of buildings on South street
Â¦were scorched and several were emptied
of their tenants, who feared that the
buildings would bo burned.
Henry Mallory said regarding the flre:
"I have no idea how the fire started
and I can form no adequate Idea, of tho
loss. The entire pier is destroyed, to
gether with the offices and other buildings
on the bulkhead. My brother, Charles,
sailed for Europe ten days ago and ha
will remain abroad two months, notwith
standing- this catastrophe. I cannot tell
what our immediate plan3 will be or when
we shall begin to build. Our books and
other documents were destroyed and I
cannot say anything about the Insurance
at present. The only positive Informa
tion that I can give at present Is that
fortunately at the time of the fire there
was not the usual amount of freight on
the pier, as the Comal sailed af 3 p. m.
Saturday and cleared up most of tho
overflow. I positively cannot fix thÂ«
origin of the flre, give the amount of
damage or approximate the amount of
the Insurance." ,

WEEK'S FORECAST IN >.
SENATE AND HOUSE
Teller Will Press His Boer Sympathy
Resolution to an Early
Vote.
WASHINGTON. May 6.â Routine busi
ness probably will occupy the greater part
of the. Senate's attention during the pres
ent week. The resolution offered by Toller
expressing sympathy for the Boers and a
desire that the Government extend both
to. Great Britain and the South African
republics its friendly offices in bringing
the toresent war to a close will be called
up to-morrow. It is the intention of tho
Colorado Senator to pres3 his resolution
to an early vote. It probably will be re
ferred to the Committee on Foreign Rela
tions, but Teller will insist that it be re
ported in some form at an early date.
Halo, either to-morrow or Tuesday, will
bring forward the naval appropriation
bill and very likely the greater part of the
week will be devoted to its discussion.
With the latitude of debate allowed under
the Senate rules, it is. quite probable that
Senators will disouss the Boer resolution,
the Philippine question and other matters
relirtlng to the foreign affairs of the Gov
ernment, while the naval bill is ijnder
consideration.
The attention of the Housn will bo oc
cupied with various miscellaneous mat
ters, except such time as may be devoted
to the consideration of conference reports
on appropriation bill?, which will be given
the right of way. The desire for an ad
journment early in June make* it abso
lutely necessary to expedite the supply
bills. The most important piece of gen
eral legislation to be acted upon during
the week will bo the amended Senate bill
to amend tho general pension laws. This
Is known as the G. A. It. bill.- . The prin
cipal changes it purposes to make in ex
isting laws are provisions for aggregating
disabilities and equalizing ratings ami to
increase the limit of income of widows
pensionable under the act of 1890 to $50.
This bill will be placed upon Its passage
to-morrow under suspension of the rules.
The bill appropriating $1,000,000 for the ml-
Htia of the several States also may be
called up under suspension of the rules.

PARIS, May. 7.â Although it was fully
recognized that the Nationalists Intended
to make a determined fight In all the
wards of Paris on the occasion of the mu
nicipal elections held yesterday through
out France, it was never seriously con
templated that their efforts would be
i crowned with such success as Is shown
! by the results, which must be recognized
*as dealing- a serious blow to the Repub
licans and Radicals.
The results show fifty definite elections
in Paris. In thirty wards. second ballots
will be necessary. The Nationalists have
gained eight seats, five from the Repub
! licans and three from the Radicals. The
! successful candidates include MM. Gaa
i ton-Mery, Galli, Le Pellleter and Ran

The Republicans have secured eight
seats, including seven members of the
old council; the Radicals and Radical So

and kissed him twice upon the cheek.
The Crown Prince then kissed the Em
peror's hand, after which the ceremony
came to an end with the singing of the
old Holland hymn, "William of Nassau."
Outside in the Lustgarten the First Life
Guard Field Artillery gave a salute of
twenty-one guns and the entire congrega
tion slowly filed out of the chapel to re
assemble in the famous White Hall, there
to be presented to the Cr*own Prince.
Among those tendering congratulations
special prominence attaches to the Presi
dents of the Senate of Luebeck. Bremen
and Hamburg, and also to the representa
tives of the municipality of Berlin, who
presented a magnificently executed ad
dress. ' . . * >
Emperor Francis Joseph has appointed
the Crown Prince to be chief of a Hussar
regiment.
He also presented to the Crown Prince
a tine portrait of himself as a Russian
field marshal. Â¦
By virtue of yesterday's ceremony the
Crown Prince has acquired the capacity
to succeed to the throne if, from any
reason, the throne becomes vacant, and
he can now claim a suitable allowance
from the crown funds. He has. also be
come Governor of â¢ Pomerania and Prince
of Oels. a post- carrying large revenues.
The Berlin press to-day publishes an
pnormous quantity of material about me
Crown Prince, biographical and otherwise,
describing him as a "most sympathetic
youth," as "earnest, unaffected, modest."
and as "filled with a strong sense of duty
and sound In body and soul."
At 7 p. m. began the gala dinner to
which United States Embassador White,
with the other Embassadors, had been in
vited. The company included only about
a score of ladies, the Empress and the
Princess. ,
The dinner was a gorgeous affair. The
band played a selection from Sir Arthur
Sullivan's "The I^ost Chord." which was
a special compliment paid to the Duke of
York: :
Emperor William proposed the health
of Emperor Francis Joseph In a One fin
ished speech. He dwelt upon the honor
and joy of the visit of his Imperial guest,
elaborating upon the desire of the Ger
mans to maintain peace, but he refrained
from referring to the Dreibund.
Emperor Francis Joseph, replying, read
from manuscript, his remarks beinsr
understood onlv by those in his immedi
ate vicinity. . However, the general im
pression was that the answer was not
political.
Durinsr the banquet Mr. White sat next
to the British Embassador, Sir Frank
I^ascelles. General comment was occa
sioned by the fact that Cardinal Kopp in
his scarlet robes was present.
Shortly' before 10 p. m. Emperor Francis
Joseph, with- Emperor William, drove
swiftly down through the Brandenburg
gate, tbo populace greeting the imperial
pair with thunderous hurrahs. Anhalt
station was reached promptly at 10 o'clock,
and nfter a cordial leave taking the Aus
tro-Hunparian ruler departed.
The illuminations surpassed anything:
known here for years.

BERLIN'. May 7.â Yesterday being
the third and last day of the fes
tivals in connection with the cele

crowded, nearly the entire Berlin popula
tion turning out and several scores of
thousands coming from the outside.
At 7 a. m. the two Emnerors. attended
by a gorgeous retinue, were present at a
special imperial mass. From the church
both drove to the Sieges Allet for the un
veiling of the statue to Emperor Slgs

and the ceremony was beautiful through
out.
Then the Emperors drove back to the
castle, where at 10 a. m. Emperor William

gratulations of the special mission, in
cluding that of the United States Embas

speech, saying' he"was very much grati
fied and that' the sentiments expressed by

rocated by both himself and his son.
Mr. White then turned to the Crown
Prince and made another brief speech to
the same purport.
Soon after occurred the symbolic ser
vices in the castle chapel, whereby .the
majority of the Crown Prince was Me
clared. The scene was most impressive.
Kmperor Francis Joseph and the German
Empress led the way, Emperor William
and the Grand Duke of Baden following.
Next came the youngest imperial child
and then the Crown Prince and the Ital

the Prussian Diet, regimental delegations,
etc.
After singing by the cathedral choir
and a discourse by the chief court chap
lain came the most impressive part of the
ceremony, the taking of the oath by the
Crown Prince. In front of the pulpit
stood a tall soldier with a drawn sword.
Across the altar was laid the ffatr of the
I,ifo Company of the First Guard Regi
ment. The Crown Prince raised two fln
pprs of his naked right hand and placed
his left upon the flag. Then Lieutenant
General von Plessen pronounced the oath,
which the Crown Prince repeated sentence

and comprehensive, the Prince vowinc to
be faithful throughout life to the Em

Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C. May 6.â Another
throng of about 800 Japanese <. coolies
reached here by the Tosa Maru thia aft*
ernoon. It was to have been twice that
many, 800 more having been booked at
Osaka, but owing to the recurrence of
the plague at that port the steamer was
obliged to leave them behind. Following
close on the heels of the Tosa Maru the
steamer Dalny Vostock steamed into the
quarantine station this evening with 850
nfore of the unwelcome immigrants, and
other vessels are en route with more. It
is expected, though, according to news
received by the Tosa Maru, that the emi
gration will shortly be stopped by the
Japanese Government.
"There are now eight emigration com
panies In Japan, which are reaping a
harvest from the emigration to Amer
ica," says the Kobe Chronicle, "and It is
understood that . the Government will
shortly overhaul the proceedings and
general affairs of these companies In a
pretty thorough fashion and crush with
no sparing hand the abuses that now pre
vail in the majority if not all of them."
This action, the paper says, has been
taken none too soon, for by misrepre
sentations the agents are sending thou
sands upon thousands to America and
the companies are making big dividends
as a result of the exodus across the Pa
cific.
Another Japanese paper gives statistics
to show that the Japanese now abroad
from their country Â»n all parts of the
world do not number more than 72,000 In
all, and coupled with the figures is the
significant statement that "included in
these are 20,000 Japanese militia men, who
have been smuggled into <he Korean pe
ninsula under the guise of coolies."
The Kobe Herald In an article on emi
gration says: "Hitherto Hawaii has been
trie most promising field, but there are
thousands there with nothing more to do
than study the beauties of the landscape.
Attempts to plant colonies in Fiji and
New Caledonia have ended In fiascos. In
the French West Indies and Peru and
lastly, in Brazil, failures were also made
in the attempt to settle." This paper ad
vocates turning the tide of emigration to
South America.
Japanese Government Takes Cogni
zance of the Emigration and
Will Probably Take Steps
to Check It.

FOR WELL PEOPLE
An Easy Way to Keep Well.
It Is easy to keep well If we would only
observe each day a few simple rules of
health.
The all-Important thing is to keep t~e ,
stomach right and to do this It Is not ,
necessary to diet or to follow a set rule or Â«
bill of fare. Such pampering simply makes '
a capricious appetite and a feeling that {
certain favorite articles of food must be >
avoided.
Professor Wiechold gives pretty good
advice on this subject. He says: "I am i
65 years old and have never had a serious <
Illness*, and at the same time ray life has -
been'largely an Indoor one, but ; I early
discovered that the way to keep healthy (
was to keep a healthy stomach, not by
eating bran crackers or dieting of any
sort: on the contrary I always eat what
my appetite craves, but for the past eight
years I have made it a daily practice to
take one or two of Stuart's Dyspepsia.
Tablets after each meal and I attribute,
my robust health for a man of my age to
the regular daily use of Stuart's Tablets.
"My physician first advised me to use
them because he said they were perfect- ,
ly harmless and were not a secret patent
medicine, but contained only the natural
digestives, peptones and diastase, and I
after using them a few weeks I have
never ceased to thank him for his advice.
"I honestly believe the habit of taking
Stuart's Dyspe'psla Tablets after meals Is
the real health habit, because their use
brings health to the sick and ailing and
preserves health to the well and strong."
Men and women past 50 years of age
need a safe digestive after meals to in-
sure a perfect digestion and to ward off
; disease, and the safest, best-known and
! most wUely used Is Stuart's Dyspepsia
; Tablets.
They are found in every well-regulated
household from Maine to California and
: In Great Britain and Australia are rapidlv
pushing their way into popular favor "
All druggists sell Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets, full-sized packages, at 50 cents,
and for a weak stomach a 50-cent pack-
age will often do S50 worth of good.

Hunting for Footpads.
Again last night the special squad of
fifty policemen, picked from the Califor
nia street, southern and northern divi
sions, patrolled the 'darkened streets of
the Western Addition dressed In citizens'
clothes and ready to take, dead or alive,
cny footpad that might show himself. The
men wandered all over the terror-stricken
district, going in pairs and prepared for
any emergency.
Frank Boell, living at D03 Greenwich
street, was taken to the Harbor Receiv
ing Hospit.il early yesterday morning
v.lth a bullet wound in his left arm.
While his wound was being dressed Boell
told a thrilling story of an encounter with
a desperate highwayman, who fired two
shots at him, one of them taking effect.
The encounter took place at the corner of
Greenwich and Dupont streets at 3:30
o'clock. Boell said:
Shot in the Dark.
"I had attended a ball at Washington
Hall during the evening," said Boell,
"and after escorting a lady companion to
her home, started for my own residence.
I started through a cul de sac which runs
into Kramer place in order to make a
short cut to the rear of my house. The
cul de sac is six feet lower than Dupont
street and I had just reached the bottom
j of the steps when the footpad Jumped
j from behind several large empty dry
j goods boxes, where he had been In hiding,
and, thrusting a pistol in my face, order
ed me to give up my money. I was par
alyzed with the suddenness of the attack
and mads no resistance and the robber
coolly went through my pockets and ab
stracted $5 50 in coin.
"I collected my thoughts, pulled myself
together, and. throwing my arm out,
knocked the pistol away from my face.
It was then that the footpad fired, the
bullet passing through my arm. The des
perate crook fired again with the evident
purpose of putting an end to my life, but
the buliet went wide of its mark and
struck one of the empty boxes. The rob
bt-r then dashed up the steps and disap
peared up Dupont street."
Boell said that as soon as he felt the
sting of the bullet he staggered down the
alleyway to Kramer place, where his
brother lives. His mother, who had been
awakened by the shots, raised the win
dow of her room and asked what was the
matter. Boell replied:
"Mother. I'm shot. Get brother to help
me."
Boell's brother came out of the house,
and a grocery man who lives near by
blew a police whistle. No officer was In
the vicinity, however, and Boell walked
with his brother to Montgomery avenue,
where a policeman was found, and the
wounded man taken to the Harbor Hospi
tal. He went to his home Immediately
after his wound was dressed. ; V- 4
Footpad Wore No Mask.
Boell describes his assailant as a man
about six feet In height, of heavy build.
He wore no mask and had a heavy mus
tache and a derby hat. As the streets
w^e in inky darkness Boell could give
no further description of the murderous
footpad.
Boell was a corporal with the heavy ar
tillery under Major Rice and Captain
Geary, and saw active service In the Phil
ippines.
The police had a theory that Boell was
shot by a Jealous rival. This Boell posi
tively denied, and said he had had no
difficulty with any man regarding a
woman.
Detectives Dillon and McMahon, who
arÂ« working on the case, last night found
the woman who was with Boell shortly
before he . was shot. She is known as
Sophie Peterson. She claims to be the
wife of "Jack" Ennia, the prize fighter.
ThÂ«* woman Bays that she accompanied
Boell from a dance at Union Square Hall,
but left him when he was a short dis
tance, from his home. She knew nothing
of the shooting until late yesterday after
noon.
Hade Mysterious Threats.
The detectives have the names of two
men who were In a restaurant at Dupont
street and Montgomery ' avenue . a few
minutes before Boell was shot. One of
them was heard to say, "It's no use try-
Ing to get him to-night, as. he- is with a
woman. I euess we had better postpone
the Job until to-morrow." They -then
left the restaurant and walked along
Montgomery avenue. â¢ "Whether they re
ferred to Boell or not is unknown.

L. Guinasso, a baker residing at 716
Grsen street, reported at the Callfdrnia
street j>ollee station Saturday that he had
been held up Friday night at the corner
of Montgomery avenue and Green street
and robbed of $400, the highwayman over
looking a $2000 check that the baker car
ried. Guinasso said ho received tho
money and check from the sale of some
property. Police officers who Investigated
turned in a story of fake and claimed
that tho baker told the footpad story to
explain away tho loss of money brought
about by drinking.
Joe Brlgnolla. a laborer living on Powell
street, near Chestnut, may be the victim
of the same man who wounded Boell
Brignolia says he was robbed of $40 early
yesterday morning by a highwayman. He
says he was walking up the avenue and
at the corner of Green street, the samo
place where Guinasso says he was held
up, was stopped by a tall man who wore
no mask. The robber pointed a pistol at
his head and fold him to hand over his
money "quick." or he would be shot.
Brlgnolla handed over $40 and was told to
go a certain distance before turning
around. The description given by Brlg
nolla tallies with that of tho man who
phot Boell. The police officers sent to In
vestigate returned the regulation report
fake.
Says He Was Robbed at Ingleside.
A man who claimed he had been robbed
of $50 and a gold watch on the Ingleside
road reported the alleged robbery at tho
Seventeenth-street police station vester
day evening on advice of Samuel Curtis
to whom he told the story at the park'
Lieutenant Anderson detailed Sergeant
Shaw and Detectives Fitzgerald and Gra
ham to Investigate the case, and they said
the story was a fake.
More Hold-Ups Reported.
The police officers have been Instructed
to Jail all suspicious characters. At 12:30 a,
m. yesterday Officer Sullivan arrested a
man named James Moore at the corner of
Ellis and Larkin streets. A policeman's
club was found concealed on the man's
person. It was subsequently learned that
he had been twice arrested for burglary.
At 4 o'clock yesterday morning Officer
Knorp found a young man sleeping in a
large dry goods box lying in front of a
store on Gough street, near Golden Gate
avenue. He routed the sleeper, and upon
searching him found an ugly hand-made
sandbag on his person. The youth gave
his name as John McNesby and said he
came from San Jose. He told a fishy
story regarding the. sandbag, saying a
drunken man had thrown it at him and
he had picked it up. He was jailed on a
charge of vagrancy.
Hen Moore -has packed his grip and
left his former home at 706 Kills street.
He savs he is through with his wife for
all time.
The black cloth found near the scene
of the Bortzmeyer robbery is not a hand
kerchief at all, but a piece of farmer's
satin that evidently formed at one time
part of the lining of an overcoat.
Police Officer Brown says Margaret
Moore Is stating a falsehood when she
says he tried to induce her to go out with
him. He declares she makes these state
ments because of anger at Getz's arrest,
and that she theatened to "get even on
him." He acknowledges he told M. H. Getz
he had fetter make hia brother keep
away from the corner of Polk and Uarkln
streets, as he was a vagrant under the
law and liable to arrest.
"I did have a black silk handkerchief
that my husband gave me, as some paper
.stated." she resumed, drying her .tears,
"but my husband took it away with other
things when he quit me for a time, three
months ago, after giving me a beating.
Getz never got any black handkerchief
from me." . â,...,
Captain Seymour says Mrs. Moore did
not tell him she had been Intimate with
Officer Brown.
That Black Handkerchief.
"The very afternoon on which Getz was
arrested," said Mrs. Moore last night.
"Officer Brown met me at the corner of
Larkin and Ellis streets and said to me,
'Why don't you shake that crazy Getz ana
come out with me?' I told him I would
do no such thing.
"I have known Mr. Brown since I was
a little girl.", continued Mrs. Moore. "I
lived with my folks on Battery street
when his father kept a sailors' boarding
house down that way. When my hus
band was in Alaska he met me and asked
me to go out with him. During the last
two months he has asked me many times

As Colonel Marceau has failed to carry
out the terms of the agreement, as In

she prays the court to adjudge the agree
ment fradulent and of no effect: that It
was entered into fraudulently and con
trary to public policy and against law
and in violation of the jurisdiction and
authority of the court. She also demands
that during the pendency of the action
Colonel Marceau be restrained from in
any manner asserting any rijrht, claim or
authority under the agreement, or using
it in any action or proceeding in law or
in equity, as evidence or the basis of any
right or relief to be granted thereunder.
In addition to this action for an injunc
tion Mrs. Marceau's attorney will file an
appeal from Judge Troutt's order accept
ing the agreement, and if Colonel Mar
ceau does not abandon It the Supreme
Court will be called upon to determine
the validity of the document. A writ of
habeas corpus, directing Colonel Marceau
to produce the body of Baby Theo In
court, that the little fellow's custody may
be awarded, will also swell the record and
complete the legal tangle. Colonel Mar
ceau expects a quick, crisp fight. A de
fense to a plan of battle such as has been
laid out for his reception will take time,
so even though he wins all others he will
thus be disappointed on at least one point.
Last evening Colonel Marceau strolled
around the city with Baby Theo. He was
apparently calm, and said that he was
determined. In her home, surrounded by
her friends, sat a tittle woman, his for
mer wife, as determined as he, and as
she is a mother, fighting: for her baby,
her determination will only waver when
the highest tribunal In the land has de
creed that she cannot have her child, or
she has found peace in victory with her
baby by her side.
As a further Inducement, she says, to
enter into the agreement. Colonel Mar

would remarry her, and that they should
live together in order to promote and fur

child. -.;.â

BABY THEO'S PARENTS ARE
GIRDED FOR THE BATTLE
Mrs. Amanda Mar
ceau-Fiske-Pennell
Has Prepared Her
Case for Trial.
FRAUD, false representations and
malice on the part of Theodore C.
Marceau, all contriving to Injure
.r-- and wrong her and in order to gain
an undue advantage with respect to the
care and possession of Baby Theo. is the
charge Mrs. Amanda J. Fiske-AIarceau-
Fennell makes against the doughty col
onel in a complaint to be filed this morn-
ing, when the battle for their tiny son
opens before Judge Troutt. Colonel Mar
ceau. holding Baby Theo tightly by the
hand, walked into the lobby of the Palace
Hotel yesterday morning. He announced
that he was here from Los Angeles to
make the fight of his life for the custody
of his little boy. It will be the fight of his
life, for he will find Mrs. Flske-Marceau-
Fennell ready for the battle. Good gen
erals, she says, plan their campaigns well.
This she has done, and if she loses it will
only tell the story of a repulse, not a de
feat. Defeat, she affirms, will only
strengthen her determination to wage the
fight the harder, but victory is what she
seeks. Victory will place her arms again
arotmd her little Theo; will fill the only
void her life knows and will bring happi
ness out of the chaos of loneliness and
misery. She does not ask that her baby
boy shall be hers alone and live only for
her. She is anxious that her baby's father
should not suffer for want of the little
fellow's love, but she demands that he be
thus considerate with her. As the colcnel
has manifested an evident determination
to wrest his little son entirely out of the
life of his devoted mother, it is certain
that the fight, even though it may be
short at this time, will be bitter and vig
orously prosecuted.
Attorney Louis P. Boardman. counsel
for Mrs. Fiske-Marceau-Fennell, has
about completed his preparations for the
fight, and out of his mind a legal maze
has evolved calculated to ruffle the cour
age of one, even though his name is
lengthened with military .title. Colonel
Marceau will doubtless rely as a basis for
his claim upon "the agreement recently
entered Into between himself and his
former wife. As his counsel have not as
yet announced their plan of action this
assertion partakes of the speculative, but
in any event this agreement will be first
attacked by Mrs. Marceau's lawyer. This
complaint lirst sets forth the date ftf the
marriage of the iitigants. the fact and
date of their divorce and then jumps into
the meat of the subject and questions the
validity of the agreement in question in
view of the fact that it stands as a modi
fication of the decree of divorce. This de
cree left the matter of awarding the cus
tody of the'ehild for the future considera
tion of the court. The court has not prop
erly considered this question, it is con
tended, hence Judge Troutt's order ac
cepting it was improvidentiy and improp
erly made. .
Continuing from these points, the com
plaint, in which Mrs. Fiske-Marceau-Fen
nell prays the court to enjoin the colonel
from in any manner asserting any claim,
right or authority under the agreement,
or using it in any action in law as the
basis of any right to baby Theo's custody,
reads:

As a naval power Turkey stands at the
bottom of the list, notwithstanding the re
spectable number of ships which' consti
tute its navy on paper. All the armored
ships are obsolete and the unarmored ves
sels are in a state of decrepitude from
want of, ordinary care. There are seven
central-battery ships ranging from 1920
tons down to 2050 tons, built between 1861
and 1874; their armor Is ordinary iron, of
which the largesfhas twelve inches, the
others six to nine inches. Two of these,
the Mesodieh of 9120 tons and the Assar-i-
Teopik are now at a shipyard in Italy un
der reconstruction. The four barbette
ironclads of 6400 tons are about thirty-six
years old and have only 5Vs-inch Iron
armor on their 6ldes. It will be readily
understood that even the heaviest armored
vessel is 'easily penetrated by the modern

the alleged fleet of unarmored vessels five
are building at Turkish dockyards and

Lobbying is a trade like another, and men who have
mastered the profession know many a trick of which
the public is unaware. For that reason the efforts of
lobbyists are not to be despised, no matter how hope
less may seem the task in which they are engaged.
The people of San Francisco will have to continue on
guard. Track gambling is an enormously profitable
trade. Unscrupulous men can afford to pay large
prices for gambling privileges, and, moreover, they
can afford to work and wait a long time for success.
The scheme for which underground wires are now
being laid by the astute lobbyist of the gang may not
be sprung upon the public for months to come. It is
a waiting game and a cunning game, and if the people
be unwary or neglectful they m2y yet find themselves
cheated of the profits of the victory they have just
won. Â¦
For the purpose of conducting this secret campaign
the track gamblers have engaged the services of a pro
fessional lobbyist, Frank McQuade, and he is now at
work seeking to obtain for his employers the privi
leges they desire. The McQuade method is that of
forming combinations and bringing their influence to
bear upon the Supervisors. He is diligently search
ing, first to find persons who have more or less of a
pull with different members of the board, and then to
find means by which he can induce those persons to
exert their influence on behalf of the racetrack
sharpers.
WHILE the people of San Francisco may well be
pleased with the victory obtained over ' the
racetrack gamblers and with the action of the
Supervisors in refusing to grant a license for track
gambling, it must not be supposed the gamblers have
abandoned the contest. They have merely changed
their tactics. Perceiving that in the face of a resolut:
public opinion they can gain nothing by an open fight,
they have resorted to secrecy and are now trying by
indirection to obtain a license for gambling later on.
TR0CK GAMBLERS fJT- WORK-
As if everything had conspired against the starving
people, the calamity comes upon them at a time when
the Imperial Government charged with the responsi
bility oitheir welfare is involved in a costly war which
not only engages the energies of the Government it
self but so absorbs the minds of the people that the
attention which otherwise would be given to the suf
ferers is directed to" the seat of war. Thus, while more
than $7,500,000 was contributed by private charity for
the relief of the sufferers from the famine of 1897, the
amount raised in that way for present relief has hardly
reached the sum of $500,000. Of course more will be
given, not only among the British people and colo
nists but throughout the civilized world; but, how
ever large may be the sums that chanty and humanity
contribute, they will fall far short of the amount of
relief needed.
In a recent review of the situation' the London
Chronicle gave the following table of the distribution
and the extent of the famine:
- PoDulatlon Number on

The area of country affected covers upward of 500,
000 square miles, being a much larger area than was
ever before stricken since the country has been under
British control; but the real measure of the severity
of the infliction is not in the extent of territory which
it covers, but in the intensity of the famine, in the
approach to an absolute lack of food. In the heaviest
of previous famines the number of persons engaged in
relief work was about 1,500,000, while how, as the
figures quoted show, relief work has been given to
more than double that number.

now become by far the most awful which has befallen

late last winter. Then they are said to
have discovered that Mr. Keene had part
ed with all his holdings between 203 and
209, and had actually gone short of thu

Whether this story had any foundation
or not, there is no question, that the
relations between the syndicate and Mr.

on Third Avenue In February last, which
'broke the stock from 106 to &\Â£. was en

punish Mr. Keena for his alleged betrayal
of .the former Metropolitan pool. . Mr. L
Keene's losses in this maneuver are saidV
to have been very heavy. They arÂ«

battle Mr. Keene's health gave way.
with the prominent interests he formerly
represented took place last fall during the
famous manipulation of Metropolitan
Street Railway stock from 187% to 269. It
is said that Mr. Keene was placed In com

members of the pool to hold their stock
until it crossed Â£75, when they were grad
ually to liquidate. â¢
Mr. Keene, however, never got the. stock
above 2C9. and while he was given a llm- ;
ited backins by the syndicate,; tha. stock
gradually fell to 147 in December of last
vear. According to the story which is
how told In Wall street. Mr. Whitney and
the other members of the syndicate did
not discover why Mr. Keene had failed
to carry out the plans of the pool untif
Conditions on this coast remain unchanged and
without particular feature. The late rains have greatly
benefited the grain and fruit crops, and the agricul
tural situation remains all that could be desired.
Thus it irill be seen from the foregoing that the
situation is fair throughout the country. AH that is
necessary, apparently, to stimulate trade is a moderate
recession from the exorbitant prices of 1899, which
ihe public now refuse to pay. When this is done and
surplus stocks are use-i up we will doubtless have an
ciher period of marked activity, and not before.
Wall street has languished somewhat of late. Con
tinued heaviness in the industrials and the readiness
of the the steel stocks to sell off on small provocation
have rendered the public wary, and the street is now
abandoned almost wholly to the professionals. Money
continues easy, and there is a steady increase in the
circulation unjlcr the operation of the new currency
bill, and no concern is felt over the recent shipment
of jrold to Europe.
While these figures are unfavorable, the export
movement of the country is making a better showing.
Flour shipments from the Atlantic coast are large, and
those of wheat and flour combined last week amounted
to 4,537,000 bushels, against 3,884,000 for the same
week last year. The exports of produce and merchan
dise from the port of New York during April were
33-4 PÂ«r cent, or over $11,000,000, larger than last year,
tnd, with the gain of $15,000,000 in cotton from other
ports, the month's aggregate for merchandise should
rise above $100,000,000. Imports show a small gain,
but will hardly exceed $70,000,000. The April exports
of breadstufis were also heavy, those of wheat and
corn from Atlantic ports exceeding those of last year.
The April failures also made a good showing, being
the smallest for any April in years. The decrease in
the number of failures was 15 per cent in the South
rnd 22 per cent in the Pacific States, while New York
shows an increase in these commercial disasters.
*' I 'HE recent shading off in quotations for sundry
articles ot commerce is having the effect antici
pated by close observers, for trade in these lines
is picking up again, while it remains dull in those in
which quotations are still stubbornly maintained.
There is a lesson in this which he who runs may read.
As The Call has pointed out ever since the beginning
of the year, prices had got so high that business in
n:any staples had become stagnant, and concessions
were necessary to restore the lost demand. Thus, in
iron and steel, which were the leaders in the decline,
renewed orders are already reported. There has been
a slight reduction of about I cent in wool quotations,
but thus far it has not resulted in any improvement
Cotton remains dull, and new business is small, while
futures are weak. In fact, the wholesale trade of the
entire country is reported quiet, though there is a
very fair retail business, especially in the Northwest
and on the Pacific Coast. The bank clearings of the
country show a net loss in business for the week of
14.5 per cent, and every one of the seven great cities
exhibits a falling off. The failures for the week were
209, against 158 last year.
MORE TONE TO BUSINESS.
Mr. Keene went long of Third Avenue stock at 116. He is supposed to have
settled with the Metropolitan Street Railway syndicate below 60 in February
and March of the present year. His loss is supposed to have been about $2,000.

FAMES R. KEENE has Just sailed
Mtor Europe on the Cunard liner
m Ivernla, announcing his Intention
Â£â& to remain abroad from six weeks to
two months. Friends of the great
speculator believe that he will remain a
much longer time.
His health is broken, his nerves are
shattered and it is the general impres
sion in Wall street that he will never
again be the factor he has been for years
in speculation. While It is denied by his
friends that he has permanently retired
from Wall street it !a stated upon good
authority that such is the case.
The strain to which he has been sub
jected during the active and exciting life
he has led 'in the linancial district has
finally overcome him and upon the ad
vice of his physician and the entreaties
of hlB wife and children he has decided
to retire with his ample fortune, which
Is estimated to be anywhere from $2,000,000
to $5,000,000. He is accompanied to Europe
by Dr. Austin Flint.
Mr. Keene marketed all his speculative
shares last week and turned his money
into investments of the soundest charac
ter. He sold over 50.000 shares of stock
and turned the money into bonds and pre
ferred stocks. At the same time he cov
ered all his short contracts. The last
flurry In the steel stocks yesterday was
said to be Mr. Keene's parting shot at the
bulls.
The retirement of Mr. Keene leaves the
bear pools In Wall street without a leader.
Health Failing Since Fall.
Mr. Keene's health has been failins
since last fall, when he Is said to have
had a falling out with a number of
big interests with which he had business
relations for years.
Despite the public Impression to the
contrary, James R. Keene has not Deen
a great operator on his own account;
on the contrary, he has acted as a
broker for the big pools, usually backed
by . tho Standard Oil â¢ Company, the
American Tobacco crowd and the Whlt
ney-Widener-Elkins syndicate, which
controls the Metropolitan Street Rail
way. These gentleman were accustomed
to Intrust their stock market operations
almost exclusively to Mr. Keene, whom
they considered the greatest manipulator
since the days of Jay Gould.
Great raids in sugar, which first made
Mr. Keene's fame, were conducted for
John E. Searles and the supar crowd
who were . formerly conspicuous In Wall
street speculation. In those days Mr.
Searles was a daily visitor at the offices
of the great, operator In the Johnston
bpildinp. Subsequently Mr. Keene devoted
his attention to the tobacco stocks, which
he manipulated over a range of about 75
points. It was. he. who enabled Oliver H.
Payne andMoore & Schley to buy con
trol .of the American. Tobacco Company
around 50,' after' hammering the* stock,
which at that time paid 12 per cent, from
119 down to 60. .

JAMES R. KEEN E, A VICTIM
of Nerve-Racking Wall Street.
GOES ABOARD FOR HIS HEALTH
T ! HE reign of the footpad in this city has become to our citizens a reign of terror, and
it is high time that something be done to kill this new -menace of Phelanism in San
'.Francisco. Since the city, by order of Mayor Phelan through his Board of Supervis
ors, has been thrown into utter darkness after midnight outrages have been alarmingly
frequent. Citizens have been made the prey of desperate criminals operating under cover
of a darkness that would not be tolerated in any other civilized city in the world. Robbery
has been rampant. Murder has been added to the crimes that stalk unchecked through
the darkened streets. The police have been utterly incompetent to prevent these crimes or
to apprehend the .criminals. The midnight marauders sink back into the darkness out of
which they came, and, unpunished., add another bloody, desperate item to the criminal
municipal policy of economy forced upon the people of this pity by their Mayor.
.Protest after protest has been voiced in vain. Every citizen who, by any of innumer
able necessities or exigencies of life, may be compelled to traverse the darkened streets of
the city may be the victim next to be robbed and perhaps murdered by the desperate men
who have been made possible by the Mayor's policy of false economy. Is it not time for
the people of this city to do something more emphatic than to protest? Is it not time for
them to take individually the protection which their officers cannot give them?
When Mayor Phelan decreed that this city should be thrown into absolute darkness
he decided that there should be a reign of terror in San Francisco and that each decent cit
izen possessed the right to arm himself and protect himself from the assassin thieves which
Mayor Phelan licensed to ply their trade under the shadows of night. When the evils of
throwing the city into nightly darkness were pointed out to Mayor Phelan he sneeringly
replied that all decent citizens should be home at midnight, and that he was, as chief
executive of San Francisco, responsible to its people. Is he willing to accept now the
consequences of that responsibility? Is he ready to stand sponsor for the brood of thieves,
thugs, robbers and murderers which he has hatched in the streets of San Francisco? Is
he willing that upon his shoulders shall rest the terrible price which the people of this
city are paying in life and property and in the daily dread of new outrages yet to be per
petrated? If being home at midnight be the standard of decent citizenship, let his Honor
the Mayor prove it, take the public into his confidence and tell where he is after midnight.
Did he need to add to his sneering affectation of responsibility an insult to every
reputable man and woman whose duties or necessities force them out of their ho'mes after
midnight, where the policy of Mayor Phelan makes them prey for every rascal and high
wayman who cares to roam in the darkness? This outrage has become a serious one to
the peopl" of San Francisco. A vicious premium has been placed upon crime. No family
in the city may be sure that out of the darkness of the night death will not come from a
robber's pistol or a thug's bludgeon.
Mayor Phelan has accepted the responsibility for all this. Let the people of San Fran
cisco force him in some tangible way to accept its consequences. He has arrogated the
right to dictate the policy of municipal departments and to remove any official who, in his
judgment, may be irresponsible. Is there nothing in the charter which gives to the people
of this city the right to remove an irresponsible Mayor? Is there no municipal law which
protects citizens of San Francisco from the actions of a man who makes gutter politics
out of his high office, and removes Commissioners because they do their duty or refuse to
truckle to his private interests? Is there no method by which a chief executive of this city,
who attempted first to place the people of San Francisco at the mercy of a blackmailing
corrupt and corrupting police administration and then makes them the prey of midnight
thieves and thugs, may be impeached? It seems high time for the people of San Fran
cisco to discover whether there is or not. ,
THE REIGN OF THE FOOTPAD.
THE SAIT FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MAY 7, 1900.
The indignation is very great, and threats of .violence are already heard in this
city, 1 for. some 1 are of the opinion that if one company is allowed to work the mines
wlthHhls class of degraded beings unmolested 'other companles'would be likely to
do the same.
Great indignation was manifested in this city this noon at the arrival of the
advance guard of a horde of Japanese, who have been employed by Poorman &
Hastings, who are running the Horseshoe Bend hydrauHc mine on "the Yuba
River, just belovy the Delhi, at Columbia Hill. The outfit consisted of eight horses,
drawing two large wagons. In addition to the gang of Japanese, the freight
consisted of Japanese goods, coal, iron, steel, hydraulic water gate, drills, etc.
One of the Japs who could maJseahlmself understood stated that. they were to re
ceive one dollar, per day and board, themselves. On being asked -how many had
been employed by: Poorman & Hastings he said. "Here are nine of us, and if we
like It a big lot more will come." On being asked what he meant by a big lot,
the reporter suggesting twenty or fifty, he instantly replied, "More than that."
So It seems ; Poorman &; Hastings have inaugurated a system of cheap labor,
in Nevada County so far as their, mine, is concerned. We now ."give them tair
warning that they -will â¢ not be permitted to disgrace this mining section by acts
of this kind.vThere are hundreds of white men In this county who are anxious to
work, and the Transcript proposes to make their fight to the end that the heath
ens shall be; driven out of the camp and honest white labor substituted therefor.

"It Is false. The fusion leaders see that
the People's party has repudiated them.
This has driven then to the extremity of
trying to Impugn the motives of those
who are behind our movement. We expect
nothing else but a campaign of slander,
but we propose to meet It as It deserves.
This whole work has been accomplished
and all expenses of the convention paid
with J700. the amount contributed by the
convention league of Cincinnati. The fu-
Asked about the charge of Senator Pet
tlgrew that Senator Hanna was helping
the convention Mr. Parker said: \
"It is well recognized by all people,"
said J. A. Parker, secretary of the Na
tional Committee of the mlddle-of-the
roaders. "whether they be Populists or
not, that the Cincinnati convention repre
sents the real Populist movement. It is
equally well known that the Sioux Falls
convention is simply an adjunct to the
Democratic party. This accounts for the
unanimity which Populists in every sec
tion have repudiated the calKfor the lat
ter convention and indorsed the Cincin
nati movement. We are confident of an
attendance fully as great as -the capacity
of our hall, and It Is claimed that Robln-
Bon's Opera-house will seat 2S00 people.
"The Sioux Falls convention cannot de
liver a vote to Bryan, that would not go
to him as the regula"r Democratic nomi
nee. Any action the Sioux Falls conven
tion may take will only embarrass Bryan
and give his enemies In the Democratic
party a chance to hammer him. He would
bo much stronger as a thorough Demo
cratic candidate than as a fusion candi
date, and if the leaders of the Sioux, Falls
convention were really for Br3'an they
would go about the matter In a way to
accomplish his election. They would
openly join the Democratic party and help
to elect its nominees. But they are not
so much for Bryan as they are for them
selves, and they are working the fusion
racket more with an eye to getting Demo
cratic support for the State and other,
offices they hold and expect to hold than
for any love of Bryan. Why, this idea
was boldly argued in the committee on
resolutions at Raleigh, In the North Caro
lina convention, which caused Harry Skin
ner to attack Senator Butler for his in
sincerity. Mr. Bryan is in more danger
to-day from these friends than he Is from
the middle-of-the-roaders."
CINCINNATI, May 6.-The advance
workers of the National Convention of
the middle-of-the-road Populists, which
will meet here next Wednesday after
noon, arrived to-day. All are opposed to
fusion and almost everything else that
has any connection with other political
parties. They claim they represent a large
majority of the People's, party; that the
convention at Sioux Falls will contain a
minority of delegates, as over two-thirds
of the delegates were Instructed by their
States for the Cincinnati convention,
which will keep in the middle of the road
and not be side-tracked in the Interest or
anybody or any party. They call atten
tion to the fact that their call Is In accord
with the Omaha law-of 1892. excluding all
office-holders, and claim that the Sioux
Falls convention is in charge of Senators
Butler, Allen and Pettigrew and other of
fice-holders, the eame as the Republican
and Democratic conventions.

? WILLIAM HENRY HARRISON. ?
He had been a Jeffersonian Republican,
but was opposed to Jackson and to Free
masonry. Webster was nominated by the
Whigs of tha Massachusetts Legislature.
Judge White of Tennessee, representing
the Southern or State rights wing of the
Whig party, received the nomination of
the Legislature of that State and car
ried twenty-six electoral votes from Ten
nessee and Georgia. Mangum and Tyler,
as nullifiera, received those of South Car
olina. Clay, the real and beloved leader
of his party, received no electoral votes.
. Under such circumstances a Democratic
triumph was inevitable, but no sooner
was Van Buren's election assured than
the opposing forces were drawn together
in a powerful resistance to the policy
which he was believed to represent. His
administration was almost wholly given
up to efforts to adjust the finances of the
country, whose unsettled condition was
largely, though probably not wholly, ow
ing to the fiscal policy pursued by Jack
son. The President and. his administra
tion were unpopular. Responsibility for
the widespread suffering due to the crisis
of 1837 and the less extreme but more last-
Ing one of 1S39 was saddled upon Van Bu
ren. So was the gross corruption found
to- exist throughout the civil service.
That these were legacies from his prede
cessor could not avail him. Every day
the mustering factions of the opposition
grew stronger. One faction of the Whigs
clamored for a new United States bank
which should relieve the financial distress.
But the President was tirm. He had come
Into office without a policy of his own,
but pledged to that of Jackson. The de
struction of the national bank and then
the failure, in 1S37. of the State banks,
including the "pets," with their $9,000,000
of Federal funds, left the Government
without income for running expenses.
Congress was repeatedly forced to issue
treasury notes to tide over the emerg
ency. -Â¦* .
In an extra session of Congress Presi
dent Van Buren brought forward a plan
designed to separate the fiscal affairs of
the Government from all banking corpor
ations whatsoever. It is called the in
dependent treasury or the sub-treasury
scheme, and provided for the holding of
the public funds in vaults constructed by
the Government In several of the more
Important cities. A similar plan had
been proposed a few years before by a
Virginia member of the House, but had
not been received with favor. Nor was
it now received with unanimity by the par
ty. Democrats In both houses opposed it.
Bills were again and again voted down,
and not until 1840 was a sub-treasury bill
llnally passed which was expected to com
paote the "divorce of bank and state."
Little as either party recognized It, the
great "bank question" was now. at last,
removed from the list of distinctive party
questions. ,
But his firmness had. only made more
enemies for the President. His great ma
jority melted away. Calhoun. who hadl
taken his followers and allied himself
with the Whigs, when such action seemed
most likely "to advance the interests of
his cherished State rights, came back to
the Democrats, declaring the administra
tion too weak to be feared. Other South
erners, however swelled the Whig ranks,
and among them were Alexander H. Ste
phens and Robert Toombs. The Whig
party grew strong in the South as well as
in the North, while the wing of the Dem
ocratic party which followed Van Buren
shrunk to a faction called the locofocos.
Another set of political problems helped
to consolidate the whig party during this
period. Van Buren's colorless inaugural
address announced his comfortable faith
that the agitation against slavery would
never be able seriously to disturb the
tranquillity of the country; and. as almost
the sole point "upon which he did put forth
a policy of his own. the paper declared
the chief magistrate to be forever against
the abolition of slavery in the District of
Columbia. That memorable battle for the
right of petition In which John Qulncy
Adams won his most unfading laurels was
already bearun. and the President's posi
tion Â¦ thus- rnnde known stirred. the aboli
tionists to greater activity. They flooded
Congress with petitions for abolishing
slavery In the District. The exasperated
slaveholders, led by Oalhoun. succeeded
In passing bills which forbade the pre
sentation of these petitions, and not till
1844 were the so-called "gag laws" at last
abolished.
Our unsettled relations with Mexico, also
a legacy from the previous administration,
were like a wizard's Incantation for rais
ing the inevitable ghost which was nevei
again to "down" until It should be burled
from sight beneath festering heaps of
brothers slain. Texas had declared Inde
pendence of Mexico and had been hur
riedly "recognized" by Jackson on ' the
last day of his Incumbency. In 1*07- she
;.skp<l for annexation to the United States.
The slaveholders . had long coveted the
vast -territory , for slave soil, nnd now
urged their claims upon Congress, while
counter petitions poured In from the
North. Even our Northern President with
Southern prtr.cinles feared to embroil his
administration further with tr<e rising tld<Â»
of anti-slavery sentiment or to Incur the
odium of a war- with Mexico which he
foresaw, and the Issue was staved off.

. MEMPHIS. Tenn.. May 6.â At sunset to
day an admiral's salute of seventeen guns
proclaimed the arrival of Admiral and
Mrs. Dewey at the city's gatesâ her
guests. A minute later, amid the acclaim
of thousands of citizens and visitors, the
distinguished couple stepped from their
special train and were driven to the Pea
body Hotel.
The train arrived from St. Louis at 6:13
P. m. The day's journey was passed
pleasantly and had no significant features
beyond the fact that at every station en
route hundreds of persons crowded the
platforms and Insisted on seeing the hero
of Manila. At Belleville, Cairo and Ful
ton Admiral Dewey shook hands with
many of the enthusiastic people.
Thousands were at the Poplar-street
depot in Memphis when the train arrived.
The streets leading to the depot were
jammed and the roofs of houses held hun
dreds eager to catch a glimpse of the ad
miral and his wife.
A reception committee met the visitors
and they were Immediately escorted to an
open landau drawn by four white horses.
When the admiral entered the carriage
he arose and bowed to the throng. â¢ Im
mediately Company A, Confederate Vete
rans, made its appearance and Admiral
Dewey again arose and uncovered j his
head.
"Gallant-looking fellows, those." he
said to some one near him, and he again
saluted the men In gray. â¢
Under escort of the veterans and the
reception committee, Admiral and Mrs.
Dewey were driven through a cheering
multitude to the Peabody Hotel. At 8:&)
o'clock to-night a limited reception was
held in the parlors of the hotel, after
which the admiral and his wife retired for
a much-needed rest.
The celebration in honor of the city's
guests will extend through Tuesday, the
party departing for Nashville on Wednes
day morning. Memphis Is crowded with
visitors and nearly every downtown busi
ness house is profusely decorated In the
national colors.
An incident of to-day's trip occurred at
the South Fork (Tenn.) water tank, where
the engine stopped for water. Admiral
Dewey was standing alone In the rear of
his car, when an old gentleman, evidently
a farmer, rode up.
"Is Captain Dewey on this tralnt"
asived the farmer. Â¦
The admiral saluted and replied: "Yes;
I am Captain Dewey. What do you
want?"
"Are you the fighting man I've heard so
much about?" asked the stranger.
"Well, yes, I reckon so," replied the ad
miral.
"Well. I knew the train would stop here
for water," said the farmer, "and my
little girls gathered these flowers In the
woods for you. We ain't city people, but
I thought you'd like them, so I drove over
with them to you."
There was a little moisture In the ad
miral's eyes when he grasped the man's
hand warmly and said:
"Go tell your little girls that I say.
'May God bless them.' and thanle*them
for me for the flowers."
Admiral Dewey was questioned to-night
concerning a statement said to have been
made by him at the " University Club
luncheon in St. Louis on Tuesday relative
to the United States being able to whjp
any nation on earth but England, and that
England was this country's friend, and
should be so regarded.
"The best answer to that question." said
the .admiral, "is. the statement in this
morning's paper in St. Louis by President
Lyonburger of the- University Club. In
which you will note he states that I did
not make the statement attributed to me.
It was made by. the president of the club."

TOWNE SUGGESTED
AS MATE FOR BRYAN
CHICAGO, May 6.â The Chronicle to
morrow will say: Bryan and Towneâ that
was the way the probable Democratic,
Popullstlc and Lincoln Republican nation
al ticket was framed up as the result of a
conference yesterday between leaders of
the three parties at the Sherman House.
The Presidential nomination was not dis
cussed, as being a foregone conclusion,
but when the conferees had delved Into
the puzzle of the Vice Presidential 'situa
tion Charles A. Towne of Duluth stood on
a pinnacle of importance that dwarfed
other possibilities.
The Populist representatives at the con
ference were Senator Marion Butler of
South Carolina, chairman of the party's
National committee; General James B.
Weaver of Iowa and Congressman George
Shlbley of Virginia. The Republicans
were represented by Senator Pettlgrew of
South Dakota and ex-Senator Fred T. Du
bois of Iowa. The Democratic representa
tives at the conference were Vice Chair
man James J. Johnson of the National
committee and D. J. Campau of Detroit,
National Commltteeman from Michigan.
Colonel Bryan was not present, nor was
Mr. Towne.
"I am not Interested myself In the Vice
Presidential nomination." said Mr. Bryan.
"I have seen the men of the three parties
present in the city to-day, but I am not
saying anything regarding conferences. I
am going home tot a two months* rest on
mv farm." * -
The Populist plan does not contemplate
the nomination of Mr. Towne at the Na
tional convention this week at Sioux Falls.
The programme of the leaders, so far as
the leaders of the Populists can lay out
the work for a convention, contemplates
the nomination of Bryan, without nom
inating any one for second place.
The convention. It was stated, would
be asked to name a committee to attend
the Democratic and Sliver Republican
conventions in Kansas City. This body
will be empowered to ratify the nomina
tion of the two parties, which are expect
ed to agree on a national ticket, but in
case of their failure to put up a satisfac
tory running mate for, Mr. Bryan it will
be authorized to name a Populist candi
date.
The object In giving such extensive pow
ers to a committee, it was Intimated, was
that the party might-hold a club over the
Democratic party to Insure the reafflrma
tlon of the Chicago platform.
Assurances were declared to have been
given that this would be done, in which
case it was eaid nothing stood in. the way
of a satisfactory fusion of all three par
ties, thus avoiding the "Tom Watson mis.
take" of 1S26. , * V,\

NETV YORK. May 6.â Edwin Wild
man, former Vice Consul at Hong
kong, contributes an article on "A
Reign of Terror in the Philippines"
to Leslie's Weekly, of which the
following is an abstract:
Although General Otis would have us believe
that the war In the Philippines Is over, I learn
from private sources of information of the
highest authority that there exists a veritable
reign of terror In most parts of the archi
pelago and even within gunshot of our army
posts. Either General Otis Is blind to the
eituatlon or Is keeping the real facts from the
American people. Agulnaldo's forces have
scattered Into marauding bands, and. leaguing
themselves with the mountain Tullsanes and
Ladrones. terrorize the country and effectually
the Agulnaldo government and the Inhabitants
are in a state of terror that prevents honest In
dustry or open alliance with American sover
eignty. ' ' .
The American < troops make short work of
these robbers, but our garrisons are so far
apart and so few In numbers that they Invari
ably are obliged to fall ., back to a " seaport
town, where" they can get supplies from Manila,
for the Insurgents have so thoroughly ravaged
the country that it Is impossible to supply even
a small battalion with native products. "
If we ever hope to put an end to this India.
warfare we must send additional forces to tlu
Islands. Our' present "force Is totally Inade

or otherwise, will be utterly useless until Ufa

I The few ports that have been obtained have
shipped away the little supply they contained
and the tons* upon *tons of hemp, sugar and
rice that are stored in the interior are beyond
the reach of buyers. The money paid for the

risoned ports has found Its way Into the insur

ruptlon and by the popular feeling that
the hard times from which the country
had suffered so bitterly rendered â¢
"change" necessary. Against him wen

ternal Improvement men and anti-internai
Improvement men. Their motto j was,
"The union of Whigs for the sake of thÂ«
Union."
The Whig Convention.
For the first time the Whigs held a na.
tlonal convention. It met at Harri.Â«bura
in December. VG9. To his bitter disap
pointment Olay railed to receive the nom
ination which he had fully expected. A
secret intrigue against him gave the nom
ination to General Harrison. The con
vention adopted a complicated and incon
venient rule for the balloting which was
never used again. It required the States
to vote as a unit (see "the unit rule" in a
previous article), but gave opportunity foi
secret balloting by the States and the us*
of committees in such way as to furni.it
every facility for schema and combina
tions. No platform was adopted, nc
principles set forth. Harrison appealed
to the voters as a man of personal Integ
rity and of a successful military cn.reer.
John Tyler of Virginia was. given second
place on the ticket. He was a life-long
pro-slavery Democrat of the* Calhour
school, but was a pronounced opponent ol
Jackson and Van Buren. He was nomi
nated In the belief that he could as VicÂ«
President do the Whig party little harm,
while the "bargain" which placed his
name upon the ticket Included the â¢lec
tion of a Senator from Virginia whom thÂ«
Whigs expected to control.
The Democratic Convention.
Van Buren is said to have demanded Â¦
renomlnation by way of vindication of his
official actions, and his fragment of a
party meekly did his bidding. The Demo
cratic convention met in Baltimore. Un
like the Whigs the Democrats had no
lack of party principles to uphold. ThÂ«
platform drawn up at Baltimore in 1S-10 li
the first political platform, oroperly sc
called, in our history and ha.s furnished
the model and in. large n-Â»rt the st:tÂ»tancÂ«
of the later Democratic platforms for
many y.pars.
The party was by that time fully com
mitted to strict construction of the con
stitution on all practical questions as
they arose and the platform of 1340 set
forth the articles of Democratic faith In
a series of uncompromising resolutions.
They declared the Federal Government to
possess limited powers, derived solely
from the constitution, whose grants ot
powers were to be always strictly con
strued: that the constitution does not con
fer power to carry on a general system
of internal improvements; that justicÂ«
and sound policy forbid the General Gov
ernment to foster one branch of industry
to the detriment of another, or to cherish
the interests of one portion to the injury
Â»of another portion of the country; de
clared against a national bank and foi
the separation of the Government finance}
from banking institutions; advanced
economy of administration and a tariff foi
revenue only.
Conduct of the Campaign.
For such a campaign as that which fol
lowed genuine "Issues" were unnecessary.
One historian has said: "There has prob
ably never been a Presidential campaign
of more enthusiasm and less thought."
Although the Whigs went into battle with
the cry. "Down with the Tarqulnsâ away
with the spoilers," and their campaign
Q -?â <^-Â»- â¢Â§>-â¢- <s> -â¢- <sÂ» -?_<$._?_ <Â£ -*-<Â£__Â»_^
speakers demanded that removals from
office should no longer be made without
statement of reasons, yet these facts
seemed to represent a mere spasm of vir
tuous feeling which the party was unabU
to live up to; for it. too, was soon found
to be poisoned by the virus of "spoils."
From the first. In view of the great pop
ular uprising such as had never been bo
fore. Van Buren's defeat was a foregona
conclusion. He represented the aristo
cratic element and was supposed to revel
in luxuriesâ such as "stuffed chairs" and
"gold spoons"â while Harrison as a "plain
farmer" was among and of the common
people and content, as campaign orators
affirmed, with a log cabin and a barrel oJ
cider. But there was really no discussion
In spite of the flood of oratory which de
luged the- land. By a sort of unreasoning
reaction from the depression and gloom of
the three preceding years, the -whole cam
paign was one long riot of rollicking
gayety and merry-making. There were
huge mass-meetings, which wholo fami
lies Journeyed many miles to attend.
There was no lack of eloquent and popu
lar speakers; there was music everv-whera
â bands Innumerable and a perfect flood of
catchy doggerel verse for campaign songs.
Sober, dignified and self-respecting dtl
zents not addicted to strong drink went
up and down the land roaring for "Tlppe
canoe and Tyler, too." and promising
with endless reiteration to "keep the ball
a-rolling" and to "beat little Van, Van,
Van." Never were such procesisons. mads
up of carriages, riders and footmen, the
gayest of banners, miniature steamships,
canoes, log cabins, elder barrels, raccoons
and Innumerable devices for attracting thÂ«
populace. All was jubilant, confident ex
citement, for no one doubted the out
come. But the vote which elected Tlp
pecanoe and Tyler, too. was even morn
overwhelming than was anticipated by
the most sanguine. A'l but seven of the
twenty-six States were carried, and the
Whlga had won their first great victory.

VI. THE WHIG PARTY.
Influence of Van Buren's Adminis-
tration Upon the Whig Party.
BY JESSE MACY. LL. D.
Jackson's commanding influence forced
his party to accept the man of his choice
as his successor. Van Buren was there
fore the Democratic candidate in the cam
paign of 1836 against the numerous nomi
nees put forth in irregular ways by the
various factions which made up the Whis
party. The Whigs, indeed, could hardly
yet be said to be a party, so diverse and
Incongruous were the elements composing
It. . The real nucleus of that which be
came the Whig party was to be found in
the National Republicans of John Qulncy
Adams' administration, who were. In a
sense, successors to the Federalists. But
by the end of Jackson's term of office all
the many political groups opposed to his
policy and methods gathered, for one rea
son or another, to make up the party of
the opposition, which called itself from
1S34 the Whig party. There was yet no
homogeneity of political principles, no
united party feelingr. no discipline, no ade
quate preparation for a contest with the
compact, well drilled, thoroughly organ
ized forces of the Democrats, who did not
scruple to use all the administrative pa
tronage to advance the party Interest?.
The Whigs held no national convention
in 1S36. but General William H. Harrison
was the candidate favored by the anti-
Masons and by several State conventions.

May Queen, the runner-up for the stake,
had a' narrow escape from being P u t out
In the fourth round by Hadtwist. She had
the speed, but the hare favored her op
ponent, and the score was 7â7 Just before
the kill. May Queen secured this and
won.
Narcissus was withdrawn after his hard
course of Saturday.
Scottish Chief was the surprise of the
day. He first defeated For Glory at odds
of 6 to 1. defeated Old Glory in the next
round and was then retired by Blackette,
a Curtis representative. The detailed re
sults, with Judge John Grace's official
scores, follow:
R. E. de B. I,opez & Son's game grey
hound Whitehead went flying through the
open stake yesterday at Union Coursing
Park. The farther he went the greater
speed he showed. This was especially no
ticeable In the deciding course, officials
in the field saying he ran faster than at
any time for three months. In this course
he met May Queen, the property of Erwin
& Lyons of Texas. The big dog had all
the best of the early part of the course,
which took the brace of greyhounds
across the field. Near the end he fell
heavily, and the spectators thought he
would not come back. The bulldog in his
nature asserted itself and his opponent
scored but two points when he killed, win
ning the course and the stake by twelve
points to two. Whitehead had previously
beaten Forest Queen 5â3, Erin J^-2, Cash
7â5, Forest King 5â0 and Blackette 6â1.
He was a prohibitive favorite in the final,
the prevailing odds being 10 to 1.
Forest King was the unfortunate dog of
the stake, getting long courses with Vic
tor King and Thornhlll before meeting
Whitehead. Whatever chances he may
have had disappeared after these courses.
In his course with Thornhlll he ran on*
minute and forty-eight seconds. Lear*
King showed marked improvement, but
a course with Jessica, in which they ran
two minutes and ten seconds, resulted In
his being withdrawn In the succeeding
round.

WHITEHEAD RUNS

AT ONION PARK
Corbett's method of training has differed
considerably from his preparation for
former contests since he went to Lake
wood. Corbett has done comparatively lit
tle road work, taking to horseback ridlne
instead. His principal forms of exercisa
have been wrestling, boxing- bouts with.
Gus Iluhlln, skipping rope, side-stepping,
feinting, short walks and horseback rid
ing. On Saturday the former champion,
boxed twenty-three rounds with Ous
Ruhlin, and finished the bout In a manner
that convinced his trainers ho would
make a hard fight. â¢ .
"A lot of smart fellows." said Corbett,
"think that I am a has-been; but I will
surprise all of them when I put on tha
gloves with Jeffries. I admit that soma
of my fights since I fought Fitzslmmons
at Carson Indicated that I had gone back,
but my showing in those battles was not
my true form. 1 did not train properly for
them. I feel as strong to-day as when I
defeated John L.. Sullivan."
"A great many persons profess to be
lieve tiiat Corbett has seen his best days
as a hgnter. Weil, I don't. I think Jim
has several good tights in him yet. and
will make a nne showing against me; but
1 am conttdent that I will knock him out
before twenty-ftve rounds are- fought Cor
bett is a much bt-tter man than either
Kltzslmmons or Sharkey, and his ability
to side-step, together with his fine gen
eralship, make him a hard man to reach
but I expect to land on him just as ef
fectively as I did on Fltzslmrnons and
Sharkey."
NEW YORK, May 6.â Prize flghtln*
having been declared legal, interest la
now centered In the heavy-weight cham
pionship battle between Jeffries and Cor
bett at Coney Island Friday night. Jef
fries and Corbett have been training for
the last two months, and now announco
that they are in perfect physical condi
tion.
Jeffries, who has been receiving his
preparation at Asbury Park, aaid to-day:
"I nave never felt in better tnm for bat
tle than at present. It would have been a
pity to have postponed the bout indefinite
ly. I was not quite myself when I fought
bharkey, weigmng leas than 200 pounds
and being handicapped by a serious In
jury to my left hand. In spite of these
drawbacks, however. I defeated tho sailor.
To-day I am stronger and in better shapa
generally than I have been since I won tno
championship from Fltz3immons. I now
weigh 212 pounds, and my left hand la ia
periect working order.

Taylor's Dog Wins Cham
pion Stake in Good Style
at Ingleside.
R. L. Taylor's Mose won the sixteen
dog champion stake at Ingleside Coursing
Park yesterday with Captain Cane's
Greenhall as runner-up. Connemara was
well backed in the run down against Syl
vanus at 3 to 1 and was looked upon as a
dangerous candidate for the stake. The
veteran campaigner seemed out of. form
when he was slipped and finally went
down to defeat, the first time in many
stakes, carrying the sympathy as well as
the money of his backers with him.
The stake-winner was in fine form,
beating Healey's good one, Slsquoc, on a
strong hare, then Sylvanus, Mayflower
and Greenhall in short order.
Greenhall, the runner-up, showed in fine
form and was worked hard all day. The
hares were strong enough to make the
hounds extend themselves, and long
courses were plentiful. . The champion
stake produced quite a few short-enders.
Sylvanus beat Connemara, 1 to 3: Green
hall beat Crawford Lad, 1 to 2; McKinley
beat Mayflower, 1 to 3, and Greenhall beat
Hot Haste, 1 to 2.
Palmflower v/on the open stake and
Cane's Miss Penman was runner-up. The
hard running of Saturday had its effect.

in the second tie after a grueling course,
lasting nearly three minutes. She led
Glenroy well to the hare. The stake-win
ner beat Little Fulierton. Remus, Glen
roy, Master Lawrence, St. Anthony and
Miss Penman, and in each event with
plenty to spare.

After a rest of *Â»n minutes Hans Klein,
whose size belied his name, was intro
duced. Hans yawned and looked bored.
He wore a suit of blue underwear, which
set off his curves to advantage. Along
side of iiis husky opponent he looked a
veritable pygmy, yet he blushinsrly stated
he weighed 230 pounds. He was to re
ceive a dollar a minute for each minute he
stayed. He earned in the first bout the
Eum of ?16 35. The Turk saw his receipts
being eaten up and in the second bout
tried hard for a fall and succeeded In se
curing one after tho Swede had earned $5.
A challenge was then shouted from the
platform that the victorious "Lion" would
meet all comers and pay them a "plunk"
for each minute they remained hostile.
A valiant youth named Fitzgerald with
more whisky in him than strength tried
his hand, but did not earn ten cents. He
was set on his head and then smothered
by the lumbering son of the desert.
The performance given in the theater
was excellent. The Dulce Sisters sansr
sweetly, the Japanese troupe did Kreat
stunts. Professor H. C Romaine took a
slide for life on a bicycle without burst
ing his tire, Priscilla Davis sang like a
nightingale, Romalo Brothers did some
marvelous head balancing and Kelton.
Hijrgins and Kelton did a great knock
about turn.
HAL.I ADALI, better known as the
"Terrible Turk" or the "Sultan's
Lion," was scheduled yesterday at
Glen Park to try conclusions with
A. G. Olsen, who goes through life under
the awe-inspiring title of the "Ferocious
Swede," but owing to the illness of the
latter the contest was postponed. As a
large number of people journeyed to Glen
Park to see the Turk and the Swede per
form, the management substituted J. J.
Cameron, a bonny Scot, and Hans Klein,
a tall Swede. Klein wrestles each day
with bales and boxes on the water front.
Adali was expected to throw Cameron
within fifteen minutes and failed to fulfill
the contract. The Scotchman wriersrled
and twisted, dodged and sweated to such
good purpose that the Turk was unable
to throw him. Whereat the populace was
glad and cheered loudly.
Tho "Terrible Turk" put forth his best
efforts, but Cameron's accent was too
much for him. When Hall Adall secured
his famous "jail" hold the braw Scotch
man ejaculated, "Dinna ye ken, mon. ye
canna doon me," and when the Turk
caught hold of the Caledonian's kilts he
howled "Hoot mon!" so lustily that tho
"lion" released his grip.

The lonpr race meet, which closed on
Saturday last at Oakland, was one of the
most successful ever given by the Califor
nlt Jockey Club. The attendance from its
Inception was large and the morale of the
Fport above reproach. This was due to
careful attention given to the pport by
Judges Murphy and Hopper and Presiding
Steward Price. On special days upper
swelldom graced the occasion with its
presence, and altogether the game never
frecmed in a more healthy condition than
when the gates were closed Saturday, on
one track -at least.
Bookmaker Barney Sohreiber will de
part for 6t. I^ouls to-day. Barney had a
very successful season, takes his bread
rmilo away with him and says he will be
out here next season.

Quite a large audience was in attend
ance at the Ingleside shooting grounds

clean scores. Wilson, after making some
fine kills, went out on his eleventh bird,
a hard flyer. Feudner and Dr. Derby

case the safety snapped forward and he
could not pull the loft barrel.
The event of the day was the twenty
flve-blrd race. Entrance fee In this affair
was $15. Seventeen of the old guard faced
the traps for honors in the contest. Wil

TWO GAMES FOR
DUDES AND THE
THIRD IS A TIE
Hank's Cup of Sorrow Over
flows With a Stream
of Errors.
Oakland 5, San Francisco 3.
Lively, erratic baseball was the exhibi
tion given by Dudes and Wasps yesterday
afternoon at Recreation Park. Ancient
Rube Levy worked the crowd into a
spasm by losing the ball over the center
field fence, Moskiman caught a wonderful
single- hander and Brockhoff made a bunch
of errors that lost the local team the
game.
Besides all this, there was enough gro
tesque base running and throwing to
startle the occupants of the bleachers out
of their soats. Steffani was unraveled only
for a small chunk, but Iburg was found
frequently, as the Fcore will show.
In the first inning, after Brockhoff and
McCarthy had pone out, Hildebrand
reached the first pack on .a bunt, and
Rube did the ros=t. Over the center-field
fence flew the spheroid, and both runners
jogsred around the bags to the plate, and
the score stood 2â0. In the third inning
Rubo was not so good. Mosklman swat
ted him a 'hard one, which Rube dropped
after a long run. Moskiman going to sec
ond, and to third on Lange's single. Then
a bit of all-over-the-tield base throwing
happened when Lar.ge started to steal
second, with the result that Moskiman
was caught at the third bag. Lange died
soon aftt-r going to spcond, and Steffani
repeated the act at first.
In the fifth Kurg reached first on
Lanpe's error and went to second on
Iburg's hit. scoring on the fake play to
catch Iburjr at second. A bad throw of
Franck's to the plate made the run easy
for Krup.
The Dudes fell out of bed in the fifth,
and Krockhoff was responsible for it all.
Francks made the first sack on a hit to
Brockhcff. and Drcr.nan followed, both
runners hugging? the bags on account of
a fulfome error by Brock. Then Dun
leavy hit to him. Sadly rattled and throw,
ins wildly to first, he allowed Francks
and Drennan to score. Moskiman rolled
the ball out for a hit. bringing- in Dun
leavy. who was at third. The score was
tiedâ for a minute. The next innlnp Hutch
lnson lost the ball in far center for three
baps, scoring on Dunleavy's hit to Brock
hoff. who threw in lobster style to the
plate. Lange added another run to the
list in the seventh. The score:

MORNING GAME.
Oakland 7, San. Francisco 7.
The Dudes and "Wasps played so long
and so poorly yesterday morning at Oak
land that they reached the time limit at
the end of the eighth, when the score was
7 apiece. Everybody was hitting- or do
ins something pyrotechnlcal with the
stick in this Inning.
Both Fitzpatrick and Beviile were found
for several lumps of hits. At the outset
the came was a lively mix-up, Oakland
sending: three men over the plate on as
many hits. There were errors In abund
ance and the crowd was kept guessing
who would be next to fall. When the bata
were packed after two hours of fierce,
unsteady play the crowd filed out of the
grounds in a trance. The score:

Rev. Mr. Smith said that from the con
versations he had had with Elder Gibbs
he believed that the congregation should
accept the resignation. Elder Cralgie
Sharpe moved that course and the mem
bers by rising vote declared their ac
ceptance. V
Mr. Gibbs was not present at the ser
vices nor the meeting which followed.
He had no reason to attend, as his stand
upon the subject had already been made
known to the flock with which he had
been officailly affiliated for so many vÂ«Â»ars.
As president of the church board he was
chairman of the investigating committee
which made a report upon the minister.
The report was censurable of certain ac
tions of Rev. Mr. Smith and was before
adoption by the church amended, a course
which Elder Gibbs did not indorse. He
contended that as Judges hearing all of
the evidence, the committee was better
qualified to choose the language of its
findings than those who had not listened
or read the testimony. By resigning his
official connection with the church he
voiced his disapproval of that action.
"Dear Brethren:' I hereby tender my
resignation as one of the elders of the
congregation, to take effect immediately.
For fifteen long years I have tried to
serve you faithfully. As a member of the
church I shall still try to be faithful to
the cause of the Master. With love for
all and enmity toward none, I remain, in
Christian love,
"WILLIAM T. GIBBS."

Rev. Guy Smith read the following letter
from Elder Gibbs:

MALIGNANT SPIRIT
PURSUES A POETESS
The closest inquiry as to the reasons of
the jury's attitude failed to reveal any
thing until a rumor reached Coroner
Mehrmann's ears that the story had been
started In town that Haar had been given
an overdose of morphine by the physi
cians. None of the jurors would admit
that they believed the story, but they
maintained their insistent demand for an
autopsy. The surgeons declared before
the jurors that but one-eighth of a grain
of the drug had been administered and
this was one-quarter of what la frequent
ly given in such cases.
Finally, after an hour of wrangling,
Coroner Mehrmann dismissed the Jury
and an autopsy was held, revealing a
blood clot on the brain four Inches In
diameter.
The -Jury will be called together again
on Wednesday, when Coroner Mehrmann
expects a verdict will be given.
The jurors are: Alfred Keating. Dr.
Simmons. G. F. Langan. G. Darling. John
Obermuller, P. Zambreskl, E. D. Warren
and Frank Lake.
The surgeons had testified that Haar's
skull had been fractured by the fall from
the buggy, from which he .had been
thrown on his head when the vehicle was
upset. They gave evidence as to his
treatment from 7 o'clock in the evening
until his death seven hours later and ex
pressed surprise that he should have sur
vived his injuries so long a time. Coro
ner Mehrmann had decided that a post
mortem examination other than external
Â¦was unnecessary and he was loth to hold
an autopsy, unless It were required to
determine the cause of death.
A Coroner's Jury at Haywarda last
night defied Coroner Mehrmann and re
fused to render a verdict in the case of
John Haar, president of the Board of
Town Trustees, until they should be given
the result of an autopsy which the Ju
rors demanded should be held. Despite
the testimony of two physicians. Dr. Dean
and Dr. Reynolds, who attended the in
jured man after he had been throwji from
his buggy, the obdurate jury still refused,
to the amazement of the Coroner, to re
turn a verdict, declaring that they were
not satisfied as to the cause of death.

"The holding of public office is most

desire to be chosen out of a multitude to

that few can resist. Henffe it is that as a

rendered by Judge Hanford of the United
States Court in the Washington district
will attract interest for its obvious rela
tion to the subject of classification of the
public lands. The case was that of the
Northern Pacific Railroad Company
against J. A. Soderberg.
The suit was to determine whether
granite is a mineral within the definition
of the word as It is used in the act of
Congress granting lands to the railroad.
Judge Hanford said that CongTess In the
use of the word "mineral" Intended it to
have a Jimited definition and to include
only metalliferous minerals. In the com
mon and ordinary signification the word
Is not a synonym for "metal," but is a
comprehensive term including every de
scription of stone and rock deposit
whether containing , mineral or entirely
non-metallic. Congress having chosen a
word of such broad significance to define
a class of lands reserved for railway
grants, the courts and the Uw Depart
ment have no authority. In construing the
act. to give a narrow or limited definition
to it In order to enhance the value of the
railway grant and to thus diminish the
rights of the public In the lands reserved.
According to statistics the output of the
Rand mines of South Africa has amount
ed to $500,000,000. while it is estimated that
this stupendous reef still contains $3,500.
000,000 between its walls. Ever since 1890
the output of the mines has increased at
the rate of $6,000,000 annually.
The Interest in thÂ« district north of Je
rome. In Arizona, has already subsided.
It has been known for years that there
is gold in that country. It is also true
that specimens taken from the new field
have assayed some thousands of dollars
to the ton, but there is not as much of
the high-grade ore as the boomers antici
pated. A large number of location no
tices was tiled. Another new discovery
of gold has been made near Payson, 100
miles from Prescott.
Considerable activity Is noticed In the
Gazelle mining district. Preparations are
making for more extensive operations in
the development of quartz mines which
will employ many men. Two new min
ing: towns are projected. One will be
known as "Manila" and the other will be
called "Carmen."
A new hydraulic mine Is in operation In
Calaveras County, near the old Table
Mountain schoolhouse, between El Do
rado and Sheep Ranch. The owners are
Messrs. Folsom. Hayden and Walker of
Stockton. They are using 150 Inches of
water with a pressure or about 200 feet.
The Morning Star mine in Plumas Coun
ty will resume operations soon with a new
company. The working force of the
Oneida mine in Amador County has been
Increased by forty men and a new stamp
mill is being built.
New York parties will probably reopen
the Pilgrim mine in Sierra County this
year and build a twenty-stamp mill.
Operations have been resumed at the
Mount Shasta Mine in Shasta County. J.
H. Tibbets and Harry L. Shannon have
secured an option on the Furnaceville
copper property in the same county lor
$25,000. r; - t .*;lfcr,
The Inyo Independent says that good
placer ground has been found a short dis
tance north of the Plute monument. Inyo
Mountains, and about twelve miles east
of Independence.
The Erie group of mines on Gaston
Ridge, in Nevada County, has been sold
to O. A. Turner, who is supposed to rep
resent Kastern parties. A twenty-stamp
mill is projected.
An attempt will be made to develop coal
en a tract of. patented land twenty-five
miles northeast of Redding, Shasta Coun
ty. Frederick H. Dakin is the mover in
the enterprise. . . â¢
The Inyo Independent Bays that the
Gold Hill mine, near Anvil Springs and
about twenty miles from Ballarat, has
been sold Wr $207,000.
The Lost Horse mine. Plnon mining dis
trict. Riverside County, has been bonded
for $200,000 to N. S. G. Todd of Los An
geles.
The Cincinnati Belle and Gold King
mines in San Diego County have been
sold to D. C. Collier Jr. They are in the
Banner district.
Hiring Development in Various Farts
of the State Is Satisfactory and
Rich Returns Are Confl
' dently Expected.
The outlook for the miners, as a result
of the work performed by their repre
sentatives who visited the national capi
tal in their Interest, Is generally consid
ered satisfactory. Attorney General
Ford, who h^s Just returned from Wash
ington, talked with the Congressional
Committee on Mines and Altnins and a
discussion took place concernlnc the plan
of the California Debris Commission for
the construction of restraining dams. ThÂ©
committeemen expressed themselves fav
orable- to early action. Tlii resolution
that will be brought forward for consid
eration was Introduced by Congressman
de Vries and rjfovides for immediately
going on with the dams, thu total cost of
which is estimated at JSOO.OOO. Air. Burton
of Ohio, chairman of the llivers and Har
bors Committee of Congress, also eaid
that he approved of the resolution. In ad
dition to this the Hermann bill, offered as
a substitute for the old mineral lands bill,
13 about to be acted upon.
With this in view a decision recently

PARISIAN Romance," the power
yi_\\ ful romantic play made famous by
if- that peculiar artist. Richard
Mansfield, was presented by
James Neill and his company at the Cali
fornia last night before a large audience.
Mr. Neill makes a daring attempt ln im
personating Baron Chevrlai. a part the
standard of which has been set by the
foremost character actor of this country.
However, there can be no question of the
fact that he handled the part with dis
crimination and a conscientious sense of
the difficulty of his work. While NeiU's
acting is not so Incisive and melodramatic
as Mansfield s. and his make-up not so
repulsive, he presents a nnlshed charac
terization notable for its evenness.
ln the banquet in the fourth act, where
df^ath strikes him, he not only shows ver
satility but gets his proper effects with
?^ t < g^acting his part. In the last act
taitn Chapman developed unexpected
talent In the portrayal, of the pathetic
scene. Benjamin Howard as the good
young man and husband. Henri de Targy
John \V. liurto.n as the doctor, and Grace
Mae Lamkm as the Earo^s Chevrial
were satisfactory, while the make-up and
blase Gearing of Frank McVicars as Tl
randel were especially fine. It is easy to
see that William Brt-wer. Labanerre, has
not been playing with the Xeill company
long, and although described on the pro
gramme as "a man of the world it
would be hard to tell what world he came
from. Enimett Shackelford was "a man
about town" from the same world
iieorge Bioomquest and Robert Morris
appeared in minor roles. Julia Dean as
Kosa Guerin, a premiere danseuse, was
as sparkling as the real champagne usfed
in the banquet scene. .
The stage settings were as attractive
as in ail the Neill productions, this being
particularly true in the fourth act. "A
i'arisian Romance" will undoubtedly do a
big week's business. The regular mati
nees will be given Thursday and Satur
day.
Sue has had a successful run at the
Alcazar, to be followed by a real old
fashioned melodrama, entitled "The
Great Diamond Robbery."
The excellent bill at the Orpheum is
making previous box receipts look like

Taking these facts into consideration,
the North Pacific Coest people have de
cided to build a vessel that will-ig>e sec
ond to none in the ferry service *on the
bay of San Francisco. She will be a
double-ender, and her speed will not be
less than seventeen knots. All the latest
improvements in machinery and electric
lighting will form part of her equip
ment. The plans and specifications of
the Union Iron Works for the new boat
will probably be adopted this week and
then the work of construction will begin
at once.
In regard to the San Rafael, she Is to
be fitted with new boilers, the old oil
lamps are to be taken out and electricity
substituted, the cabins are to be remodel
ed and the lower deck put into first-class
order. The new steamer will probably be
called Tamalpals after the old steamer
which did yeoman Work for the North Pa
cific Coast and which is now being torn
to pieces in Oakland Creek.
Elk No. 1 Sails.
The Elk Xo. 1 got away for the gold
fields yesterday, and of all the strange
craft that ever left San Francisco on a
prospecting cruise she is the strangest.
Originally she was a small auxiliary
sloop, but her passenger accommodations
were built up aft until she looks like a
yacht with a top-heavy stern.
The Elk No. 1 took away about six
teen passengers, among whom were three
women. Captain Dunham has charge of
the outfit. Among the passengers were:
Mike Smith, the well-known politician;
Sam Horton, the sporting man; ex-Sena
tor John E. Hamill. Tim Sullivan, Leslie
Bareslin of Napa, G. L. Weilberg, -Cap
tain McFarlane of Napa and J. Gilmore
and wife. . -
. The vessel will touch at Halls Island

before venturing farther north and pros
pects will be made, there. Included in the
party Is an expert assayer and surveyor.
New Stsamer Kyichak.
The Alaska Packers' Association's new
steamer, Kyichak, arrived from Portland
Saturday night and was docked at Fre
mont-street wharf. She was a long time
getting here from the Columbia River,
having to come down under one boiler.
When completed and ready for her trial
trip it was found that one of the boilers
would not sustain the Government pres
sure. As the repairs could be made much
quicker in San Francisco than In Port
land, the vessel was brought down under
one boiler. In the meantime the Alaska
Packers' .Association required a vessel to
do towing between the canneries, and as
the Kyichak could not be got ready In
time the steamer Rival was chartered
and sailed for Bristol Bay yesterday. As
soon as the Kyichak can be got ready she
also will sail for the north and return
with a full cargo of salmon.
Water Front Notes.
The mail steamer Alameda is still held
In quarantine, but her cabin passengers
were released yesterday and landed at
the Oceanic dock. The fumigation of the
vessel is now almost completed, and the
chances are that she will dock to-day.
Charles Nelson's new steamer, Santa
Ana, had her builder's trial trip yesterday
and proved herself to be a fast boat. She
will probably have an ofllcial trip to-day,
after which she will sail for Nome via
Seattle.
Alex Farquhar, one of the crew of the
British ship Sierra Pedrrtsa, was treated
at the Harbor Hospital yesterday for a
lacerated wound of the scalp. As there
appeared to be a possible fracture of the
skull, Dr. Starr held him for observa
tion. Farquhar got Into a squabble over
the, Boer-British war and the Boer sym
pathizer hit the Englishman over 'the
head with a club.
The British ship Euphrosyne arrived
from Calcutta yesterday after a smart
passage of 121 days. She was caught in
a severe storm when a few weeks out
and lost eighteen sails. Otherwise she
is all right.

THE LATE GEORGE W. BEAVEB*
MISSION TRACKS
MAY BE REMOVED
TO-DAY BY FORCE
The Railroad Company Has
Failed to Comply With
Supervisors' Order.
Time for Filing Written Agreement
to Abate Nuisance Expired at
Hidnight and Summary Ac
tion Is Promised.
The time limit Riven to the Southern
Pacirtc Railway Company by the Board of
Supervisors to file a written agreement to
take up the tracks in what Is known as
the Mission district expires at 12 o'clock
to-night, and unless the corporation takes
Fnitif* action during the day the Board of
Public Work? will prore<Hj to carry out
th<? orders of ihe city fathers. Just thirty
days ago -the Mayor signed an ordinance
passed by the beard declaring the tracks
operated by the Huntlngton corporation
on Harrison and other streets a public
nuisance. It was requested cf the railroad
to promise In writing that the tracks
would be removed by Auirust 1. 190L In
oefault of that agreement being filed to
day the Board of Public Works was di-
then became In
terested In several large corporations, and at the time of his 6>ath -was
vice president of the Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Company and director of
the San Francisco Savinjis Union. San Francisco Gas Light Company and
California Cotton Mills. He retired as a director of the Spring Valley Water
Works a fevf months apo on account of his failing health.
He leaves a wife, two sons and three daughters â Fred H., George L.,
Annie. Kate and Ethel Beaver. The funeral will take place to-morrow
morning: from the First Unitarian Church. The interment will be at Laurel
Hill Cemetery.
rected to take summary action in reliev
ing the Mission residents of the track's,
which have been a menace to human life
ever since their construction.
The Kentucky corporation may save
Itself any further trouble in the matter in
one of two ways. The first is to go before
the Board of Supervisors to-day' and ask
for an extension of time specified for the
removal of the tracks. Judging from the
remark let drop by the Mayor at the last
meeting of the Street Committee, when
Attorney Foulds stated that he did not
know what his company would do, it is
thought that this -course will save it con
siderable trouble. Phelan, In catechisinr
Foulds. suggested:
"Well, suppose you come before the full
board and ask that- you be given more
time to take the tracks up."
Foulds declined to say what would be
done, hut it is thriUKht "that the company
will follow out the advice of the Mayor
or else get out a writ of injunction re
straining the Board of Works from de
stroying its property. It is said that the
corporation feels safe in its position and
that it is certain that it will beat the case
in court-
On the other hand. Supervisor Megulre,
who fathered the measdie to remove the
tracks, feels confident that ttie railroad
company will bp fortvd to comply with
the tcrzns of the <*rdir.anrÂ«Â».
"The ra!lrt.ad company." said Maguire,
"wl!! certainly he obliged to obey the
man'.ntes of the board before leng. This
matter is cf vital interest to 50,000 people
who live in the vicinity of the tracks and
who are in daily peril of their lives. The
company's attorney accuses us of being
unreasonable in not giving more time, but
1 claim that it has been the unreasonable
party in maintaining a nuisance for the
past thirty years or more"
Because he chastised his 13-year-old son
for refusing to obey him James Sharkey,
a hard-working man, was arrested Satur
day on a warrant charging him with in
sanity. After being formally charged at
the City Prison he was removed to the de
tention ward of the Receiving Hospital
and locked up In a padded cell.
Tho attaches of the hospital say that
Sharkey is sane and refer to his arrest
as an outrage. They are anxious to re
lease him, but are not at liberty to do so
until he is examined by the Commission
ers of Lunacy.
The complaint on which Sharkey was
arrested was sworn to by his wife. She
stated under oath that he was mentally
incompetent and not a lit subject to be at
large.
"I" don't know why I have been locked
up," remarked Sharkey. when seen yes
terday. !'I am as sane as any person, and
why a warrant should have been issued
for my arrest for Insanity is beyond my
comprehension. It is true that I did chas
tise my boy, but 1 did it for his own good.
Friday evening I sent him on an errand
and as he did not return until after mid
night I questioned him as to where he had
been. He gave me to understand that it,
was none of my business and I slapped'
him with my open hand once or twice in
the face. The next day, to my surprise, a
police officer visited the place where I
have been employed and, after reading
the warrant charging me with Insanity,
placed me under arrest. I would not have
cared if my wife had had me arrested for
battery â but to think that â¢ she would
swear to a warrant charging me with In
sanity."
Sharkey spoke rationally when telling
his story, but seemed grieved that his
wife should swear that he was crazy.
"I suppose she wants to get rid of me,"
he continued, "notwithstanding- that I
have always made her a good living since
we were married. I am willing: to quit,
and as soon as I am discharged by the
Commissioners of Lunacy I intend to pack
my grip and leave her to herself."
Sharkey will be released this morning
on the recommendation of the doctors of
the Receiving Hospital, as they are con
vinced that he is sane..
He Feels the Disgrace, and Tells of
His Sorrow at Being Arrested
on. a Trumped-TJp
Charge.
James Sharkey Humiliated
by His Wife, Who Says
He Is Crazy.

The output 'of oil in California * has In
creased from 1,245,123 barrels in 1S95 to
2,292,123 barrels In 1899. The prospect is
that the output for the present year will
be much larger than that of 1SS9. Califor
nia now ranks fourth among the States
in the Union in petroleum production. In
dications of petroleum are found in all the
counties of the State from San Diego to
SIsklyou. Actual production has been
confined to Los Angeles, Fresno, Ventura,
Santa Barbara, Orange, Kern and Santa
Clara counties.
One significant feature of the oil dis
coveries in the State Is that they will
put California on an* equality with other
States in the Union as far as the fuel
question goes. The estimate has been
made that three and one-half barrels of
California petroleum are equal to one ton
"of coal. Kxperiments were made on the
ferry-boat Soiano some years ago to test
the relative cost of coal and petroleum as
fuel. It was found that the cost per mile
of coal for fuel was 52 cents and the cost
per mile for oil was only 45 cents. The
banta * e Railroad Company tried coal
and oil comparatively in locomotives, and
the conclusion was reached that a train
of cars could be run 12.33 miles farther
on P n %, ton ot oil tnan upon one ton of
coal This is illustrative of the claimithat
the State has found an abundance of fuel
within its own borders.
There are now four oil refineries In Lbs
u geles^ h ? unIte d Capacity of which Is
about 1000 barrels per day. The Times
makes this sanguine statement: "The oil
development now under way In California
is really of greater importance to the
btate than was the pold development of
fifty years apo. because, in addition to the
direct wealth that is to be extracted from
the ground, the production of petroleum
