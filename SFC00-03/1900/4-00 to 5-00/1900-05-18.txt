LONDON", May 17.â The War Office has
received the following dispatch from Gen

BULLER MAKING
STEADY HEADWAY
The long" cruise (of the Tolna, v.ith - her
many, hairbreadth escapes and the many
adventures * of her Â¦ owners, pass from
the realm of the "romantic" and "delight
ful"âas . they have been characterized by
the 'admirers of the titled coupleâ to
cruelties a3. set down In the complaint.
The cruelty charge *is a complete'itiner
ary' of the, couple and is as exact; as , a
seaman's logbook. It runs as follows: :
; That I from the; date of their said marriage
until ; October ;9, 'Â¦Â¦ 1S93, ";. the plaintiff and de
fendant, during . most of the time, lived ' with
the -parents^ of plaintiff at the , nous 3 ; of. her

Married Life on the Tolna;
SOCTETT got an unlooked-for shock
yesterday when Ella Countess Fes
tetics de Tolna (formerly Ella Hag-'
â¢ gin) filed ' a suit for divorce from
her roving husband. Rodolph Count
Festetics de Tolna. once lieutenant In the
Eleventh Austrian Hussar?, in the Supe
rior Court of this city and county.
Desertion, failure to provide and cruelty
are the grounds *?pon which the lady begs
the court to rid her of her noble foreign
spouse. And there is a special little pray
er In which the Countess entreats that
she be no longer burdened with s\ title
but allowed to resume her maiden name. :
The complaint In full is n terrific eye
opener and cruelly punctures the 'touch-;
ing romance of one long, continuous
honeymoon with the fleck of the yacht
Tolna for the scene of uction. Stripped of.
Its legal verbiage, the document tells a
tale of hardships, dangers encountered,
privations, uncongenial surroundings,
cruelties,* impaired health, a wife's devo
tion and a man's selfishness. All this the
American girl wearing a foreign title un
complainingly submitted to until April, 1
1899, when * Count Festetics declared hla
Intention . to sail 'his yacht for Colombo;
Ceylon, and to other places In the Indian
Ocean, and thence to the east coast of
Africa. To this trip the Countess demur
red. Her health had become greatly Im
paired by, her -long life upon the yacht
Tolna and the many and constant dangers
she had encountered. She besought the
man who had promised to protect' and
cherish" her to abandon the yacht, alter
this mode of living and to procure a home
upon land at some place convenient and
satisfactory to himself. â She explained to
her titled husband how the contemplated
â¢voyage was fraught with' unusual' dan
gers and entirely beyond her strength and
powers of endurance. The wife's -appeal
did not^touclrthe Festetics heart. He re
fused to alter his plans and she asserted
her true American womanhood, and then
and there! told him it was impossible for
her to live any longer upon the yacht.
Thereupon ;bn April '20. 1SS9. Count Fes
tetics sailed away on his yacht for Co
lombo and left thV Countess at Singa
pore, alone. "unprotected, without money
or other means of -subsistence and with
out any. place of abode. , The Countess'
stay at Singapore was brief. She applied
to her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Louis Hag
gin, and they, furnished her with the
means to return to the United States.'
.After, reaching as aforesaid, plaintiff
visited the interior of Japan in company with
defendant for, about two: months, when they
returned ! to Kobe and resumed their ' living
upon said yacht until early In October. 1S97.
when 'plaintiff 'received ' news of the sickness
of her mothfr. and by reason thereof took pas
sage ' by^ steamer for California. , (eavins de
fendant '"at" sa'Id 'Kobe, and arrived .at San

the defendants remained on said yacht, and in
the meantime sailed It- to Hongkong:, where
plaintiff Joined him early. In May. . 1S3S. and
they - lived, thereafter ' upon said yacht until
about the end of that: month, when defendant
announced his intention of proceeding thereon
to Manila. On or about the first day of June.
1898. plaintiff" "objected to staying longer on
said . yacht, and- stated to defendant that the
same was an unflt place for her to live, that
to remain thereon was extremely dangerous and
Injurious to her health, and that It was un
reasonable for him to expect h*r ' to* longer
continue In , such" place and mode' of living;
all of which said statements were true; b*it de
fendant Insisted that plaintiff should remain
with him on said yacht, and plaintiff yielded
to his commands and wishes in this respect
and proceeded with him thereon .to Manila,
reachlns that port In June. 1S9S. and thence
they sailed to Borneo, reaching Sandakan. oa
that island, in August, 1S3S, and remained
there about sis weeks, and then sailed to
Labuan, ' remaining there about one
month. and thence sailed to Singa
pore, arriving- at the latter place In the
month of November following. During all this
time, : with rare exceptions, plaintiff lived on
said yacht by day and by night, even when in
port.. From November, 1S98. until April. 1S93,
the ' plaintiff and .the defendant remained at
Singapore, living on .the yacht a part of the
time, when not visiting residents of said place.

HAROLD COURTENAY
GETS HIS DIVORCE
tlful place in Napa Valley, the homo ot
her aunt. Mrs. George Hooper.
The lady who has appealed to the law
to rid her of husband and title was form
erly Miss Ella Hag=rln. daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. Louis Haggln, and grandnlece of
Mrs. X.loyd Tevia. It was during a two
years' sojourn in Paris, daring which
period Miss Haggln was undergoing the
elaborate educational process of being
"finished off," that she met Count Festet
ics. The Count at that time was cutting
quite, a dash in the social world of the gay
capital. He had not yet thought of navi
gation, but was contented with driving a
four-in-hand in the bois. The piquante
American girl attracted the attention of
the Austrian lieutenant, and when she left
for her home in New York Festetics found
business to call him to the American me
tropolis. The wedding which followed was
a quiet but elegant one, as befits the nup
tials of the daughter of a many times
millionaire and a nobleman of the Aus
trian empire. It Is to thl3 wedding that
the society gossips are now referring ana
building the possibilities of what the titled
gentleman's answer to the complaint may
be. Count Festetics is a Catholic, his wife
an Episcopalian. They were married ac
cording to the rites nZ the Episcopal
church. There was no special dispensa
tion. After reciting theso facts, the gos
sips argue that under those circumstances
Eila Haggin would not in Austria be rec
ognized as the wife of ftodoiph. Count
Festetics de Tolna. Therefore, they add.
the Count will make answer that the lady
; known as the Countess Festetica is not his
. legal wife.

and the best persons to represent them
were chosen later. No man was selected
especially on account of denomination or
locality. The men given a place upon our
programme are such as have actively
identified themselves with our work and
are experts along its various lines. It Is
to be regretted that so many prominent
speakers have been compelled to decline
the invitations to speak for us. The gen
eral assembly' now meeting in the East
has deprived us of such stalwart Presby

STOCKTON, May 17.â There has been
some talk that the Congregatloriallsts had
too large a representation on the pro-
W. H. G. Temple, D. D.. of the Seattle
Congregational church, responded for the
visitors.
The convention sermon was delivered by
Rev. S. D. Hutsinpiller, D. D., of Central
M. E. Church of San Francisco, and It
.was one of the best sermons ever heard
in the city. Those who had the privilege
of hearing it say that it was Indeed a
treat. Special music and a chorus by the
choir made up. the remainder of the pro
gramme.
After the convention adjourned an open
air band concert was given on the plaza
and hundreds turned out to listen and to
view the electrical display furnished by
the electrical company.
The Courthouse dome was lighted with
hundreds of Incandescent lights, while
the words "Stockton Extends Greetings,"
made of colored lights, made a pretty
scene and one not soon to be forgotten by
those who witnessed It.
To-morrow a lengthy programme will
be carried out. The remainder of the
delegates will reach the city on the early
morning trains and the State executive?
committee will hold a session, at which
much Important business will be trans
acted.
UNFORTUNATE ABSENCE
OF PROMINENT SPEAKERS
OPENING OF THE CHRISTIAN ENDEAVOR CONVENTION.
The matter of greatest Importance per
haps will 'be the announcement that there
will be no State division of the California
union: : The matter, although urged -.by
some a' few- months apro, has been kept
from much publicity. Some of the mem
bers of- Southern California- wanted to
withdraw. It was decided not to stand In
their way, and so the matter was quietly
submitted to the Southern California
unions for a vote. It was lost and the ex
act result will be announced. It is ex.
pected that the announcement will raise
the greatest enthusiasm of any during
the convention. ,
"Who will be the next president of the
State Christian Endeavor? That is a very
important question to-day, although the
election does not come off untU Saturday.
The man In line Is James M. Warren 6f
Santa Barbara, but he says he cannot ac
cept on account of his duties as a bank
clerk, J. W. Ross, chairman of the local
committee, is next in line. He says It
would be Impossible for him to accept.
The next man is E. H. Baker of San Jose.
Others mentioned are Claude McFarland
of Los Angeles. Dr. O. S. Dean of Ala
meda and Charles Stewart of Ventura.
If it does not fall among them it is not
known where It will strike. It may end
In Mr. Ross taking the nomination. Ac
cording to denominational succession the
president should â¢ go to the Christian
church, but it Is not compulsory.- -For

unite to elect the latter. The rumor of
this powerful combination caused alarm
among the other candidates, who talked
of uniting the Held against them In an

NEW YORK. May IT.-Th* principal
event in connection with the visit to this
city of the Boer delegates occurred to
day when they were received at the City
Hall by the Mayor, and in accordance
with the resolutions passed by the Mu
nicipal Assembly, officially welcomed to
the city. Accompanied by the reception
committee and a delegation from the
Bouth African Club, the delegates drove
from the Hotel Manhattan to the City
Hall, where the Municipal Assembly and
the Mayor were awaiting them.
In anticipation of their arrival the cus
tomary large crowd around the City Hall
was largely increased and the services of
a number of policemen were required to
keep the. people from the Mayor's office.
The hour sot for the reception of the dele
pates was 3 o'clock and promptly on time
the first line of carriages turned into City
Hall Park. The crowd's pressed around
the carriages and cheered and the dele
gates raised their hats In acknowledg
ment.
Mayor Van Wyck was at his desk when
the delegation entered his office. Kiliaen
Van Renssalacr, chairman of the recep
tion committee, introduced each of the
delegates in turn to the Mayor, who said:
I sir. dehffhted to welcome you to this city of
New York and to assure you that in America
>r>u w!Jl receive a cordial welcome from the
liberty-loving people of this country. I desire
to inform you that the representatives of the
city of New York have asked me to extf nd you
a welcome, and I welcome you on behalf of
the peoi le of the city. Never since I have heen
In the Mayor's office has a more pleasant duty
\*tz\ discharged by me than this one to welcome
you on behalf of a frc-e people. I want to as
mre yr,u that wherever you iro you will find a
ivrlcome from the people, and we hope that
Â¦when your mission Is ended and you are return
ing to your own country you will again call on
us eo that we may have the pleasure of giv
ing you another welcome.
' Delegate Fischer said:
This is to us an occasion of pleasure and of
rride. Wt are not so conceited as to take to
ourselves the honor shown us, but we wish to
Fhow that we <VÂ» not represent an unworthy
r*er>le. We believe that no people can under
nand what it is to struggle for freedom ex
Â«ept a ;>eople which has Rained its freedom by
turh a struggle. We have been told to avoid
the pitfall* of party cliques and we can pay
i hat we are as ignorant of party cliques as when
we arrived. The reception that has been given
to us comes from all classes of people. We
â¢ annol think that the mission to seek peace
lor our country â peace with honor â win be un
successful. We hope we shall attain the ob-
Jects cf our rnissicn and we are encouraged in
our hopes by the splendid reception we are
glren everywhere. You. Mr. Mayor, would not
receive us a* you do if you thoupht us un
worthy. This reception by you is an honor
wtilch -we will remember. TTie small liberty
loving people will think thÂ» better of, their biff
brother. We tbirJc we will come well out of
the ftnifgle. We have been told that ninety
per cut of the people of America sympathize
with us. We want to convert the other ten per
cent by simply telling the truth. We hope that
a free rÂ«"oplÂ» will not have appealed to you
free people In vain.
Alderman Kennedy then read an address
prepared on behalf of the Municipal As
sembly, welcoming the delegates.
Then Mr. Van Renssalaer introduced
Delegate Wessels, who said:
Each member of this committee has a part to
perform. The part assigned to Mr. Fischer is
speech-mailing. We have other duties which
we v.-Ul not mention now. We have come to
tell t!-:e free peonle of Amrrlca that we mean
to win and to retain our freedom: If not to-day,
to-morrow; If net to-morrow, we will keep on
fighting for it for the next one hundred years.
We have ha<r to fight for our liberty. We dirt
not want to fight, but we had to. We ou;;ht

war. It is like a little boy trying to defend
himself when attacked. If we are beaten
America will probably be ashamed In future
years if the question should be asked, "Whrt
lias happened to your little brother?"
Delegate Wolmarens, who spoke 'n
Dutch, grave a history of the Transvaal
trouble from the beginning. lie said:
We never sought the war. It was thrust upon
up. We were robbed of our independence in
1*77 and regained it in [SSL. By the co-operation
of a small but well di=i>osed party in England
of which Gladstone was the head we. got the
convention of 1SS4, which pave us our inde
pendence without suzerainty. The question
was not disputed until after the Jameson raid.
We have tried to have all of our disputes arbi
trated. This has been refused by Mr. Cham
berlain and Sir Alfred illlner. We are grati
fied at the way America has subscribed for the
widows and orphans of the Boers. We want to
prevent the maklnjr of more widows and or
phans by dumdum bullets or otherwise.
'/Before you leave," said Mr. Van Wyck,
"I want to express to you my sincere "sor
row at the death of General Joubert. I
knew him when he visited this country
and he told me about the previous trou
ble. I hope you -will convey to his widow
my deep sorrow. Again,' I wish you god
speed. May yeu be successful in your
mission."
The members of the Municipal Assem
bly who were present were each in turn
introduced to the delegates. Then a group
of .women were introduced, and Mr.
Fischer said he relied on the women of
America to help along that sympathy for
the struggling Boers which was now so
sorely needed.
As the envoys left the City Hall they
were shaken by the hands by persons on
all sides. .
On making their reappearance the
crowd set up a cheer, and Mr. Fischer,
standing on the steps of the City Hall,
delivered a brief address. In which The said
the people of the Transvaal and the
Orange Free State were struggling for
their liberty and wanted the sympathy of
the people of America.
Then they were escorted to their car
riages. It took several minutes to extri
cate the carriages from the crowd â¢which
pressed around and shook hands with the
delegates.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. WELLINGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON. May
17. â What chance the Boer Commissioners had of being: received officially by
the President and Secretary Hay is lessening in consequence of their con
ducr in New York. American officials have been following with close inter
ort the Fts.temer.ts the delegates have made. It Is unusual, according to the
official: 1 , for diplomatic representatives of foreign Governments to come to the
United States and immediately upon arrival publicly announce the purport
cf th*ir mission before they obtain recognition, and some of the authorities
do not hesitate to call puch conduct hiphly improper. It is still the purpose
Of the State Department to receive the delegates as "distinguished strangers." ,
and after they have presented such papers as they may have the question of
their recognition as representatives of the Transvaal will be determined. It ,
is becoming apparent to the officials, however, that the mission of. the Com
missioners is more of a political than a diplomatic character, and whatever Â¦
proposition they may make looking to the intervention of the United States
in South Africa, it Is altogether likely that the President will decline to act. '

appropriation bill was considered in the

for the extension of the pneumatic-tube
service created some debate and was un
der dltcuEFion when the measure was laid
aside for the day. Wolcott, chairman of
the Committee on Postofllces and Post

and the appropriation a waste of money.

Keep Up Their Fight.
WASHINGTON. May 17.â The repcrt of
Secretary Hoot. General Corbin and other
arir.y officials on the army canteen, sent
to the Military Committee to-day, called
cut a reply which was filed with the Mili
tary Committee by Rev. Wilbur F. Crafts
of the Reform Bureau ar.U Mrs. Margaret
Dye Ellis legislative superintendent of
the Women's Christian Temperance Un
ion. It says in part:
The administration yesterday for the first
time carae out openly in favor of army liquor
f<-'.::r^e en its merits. Hitherto the plea has
b- en that the administration could not suppress
canteens because the law ot Congress was
ambiguous. Both Secretary Root and Prwl
der.t McKlnley recently said that it Congress
would epe&k. In plain terms they would enforce
the law. This attitude has now been aban
tfnr.fd and the Secretary of %Var, whose acts
er.d wcr<5* the ccurts declare are to be taken
as these cf the President, has con-.e out in open
advocacy of liquor eelllr.g canteens. Secretary
Boot, apparently oblivious of the new aritl-can
teen deveiopir.ents In the British a.nd French
i. . :. .â¢-*-. *-a . : >'-*-*Â¦-! tn &n cfncl&l cononsunl
catlcn to Concress:
"I think the enactment of this bill would be
Injurious to the temperance, morals and disci
pline of the enlisted men of the army."
GeneraJ Ccrbin. In declaring that prohibition
ra.nnpt be made effective In the army, forgets
the success of rallro&ds In securing abstinence,
end his reference to the benefits of canteens in
I Manila is particularly unfortunate for his case.
In view of the conclusive testimony as to the
unparalleled drunkenness and insanity of our
soldiers there.
We axe charitably seeking some creditable
excuse for General Corbin's statement that
professlcntl temperance reformers and asgres
Â«lvÂ« saloon influence are working together to
suppress the canteens In the face of the fact
that the liquor papers have unanimously op
poeed the actl-c&nteen law.
Â¦WASHINGTON, May 17.â The Indus
trial Commission to-day made a prelimi
nary report to Congress on the subject of
transportation. The commission states
that "owing to the Incompleteness of its
Inquiry the commission is not prepared at ,
present to make recommendations to Con
press or to tue State Legislatures, but
contemplates the making of such recom
mendations hereafter."
The report made to-day covers 831 pages
of printed matter, the larger part of
â¢which is the testimony that has been
token on the subject of transportation.
In a review of the evidence, the commis
sion saye:
Willie detailed and Â«p*clfle statement* as to
thÂ« con(JKJoaÂ« of labor and traffic have not
BSB&U7 been sought many general statement*
. i to tfceÂ»Â« conditions have been obtained, and
although there Is, of course, not a little t\t
teifnc* of opinion, conclusions as to facts
err.Â«rre with clearness from the testimony.
.Natura-Uy there in even greater difference of
judgment as to r.eÂ«4ed explanation, but here
again It Is posÂ«lblÂ« to eather sorr.e fair con-
CitHrtnni concerning the preponderance of opin
ion among these most Interested to some of
the Important matters now before the p*oplÂ«-
On the question of discriminations be
tween individuals, the report says the
general consensus of opinion among wlt
r.esses is that the railways still make
them and uerhapsr- to as great an extern.
sis ever before.
They also say that the evidence is dear
thai the great terminal elevators In Chi
cago and to a less extent in other grain
markets are owned by comparatively few
persons; that the owners of the public
elevators also control great private ele
vators; that they themselves buy a large
proportion of the grain which comes Into
public elevators, and that the business of
handling grain on commission has been
very greajly reduced by this practice. It
&lbo is claimed that these men bwn most
cf the country elevators. The commission
concludes on this point:
In view cf the quite general acknowledgment
arr.ong railway mÂ«n that discrimination In
fuv-r cf large th:;pers Is etlll conspicuous,
I. '.ere see:n* to be a considerable probability
VbMX the claim that ffcese large elevators re
ceive favcrt from the railways la one way or
another -.-* s .-.Â« basis.
On the question of grain rates and flour
shipments it ia stated that tho evidence
eeerr.s conclusive that the effort of dis
crimination has already been disastrous
to our milling Interests, and that proba
bly tven with the difference in rates re
duced as already shown it will continue
to be injurious.
Other questions discussed are: Discrim
ination between places, pooling, freight
classification, railway consolidation and
capitalization. Government ownership,
taxes, wages, labor organizations, etc.
The conclusion is reached with reference
to the powers of the Interstate Commerce
Commission that they are more limited
than was intended by the framers of the
interstate commerce law.

and distributed to Cuban Postmaslorn. a j
number of whom, it is alleged, shared !n .
the profltp with the chief culprits. Th*>
printing off.c? is said to have fre*>r\ search- :
Â«d from garret to cellar for the material j
used. Heretofore the search here was i

printed in Monde and sent for distrlbu- |

by the Government, as well as scientific
institutions. He is a Californlan and' was

friends call him. If serious mishap has
befallen the popular photographer his loss
will be keenly lei t in hi.s home city.

â¢ :
VICTORIA, B. C. May 17.â On April V2,
two days before the steamer Aorangt
sailed, a conference of trÂ»a Premiers of the
Australian colonies wavs held at a Â»fÂ«
bourne to discuss the amendments tojtne
"commonwealths bill," which has fori it*
object the federation of tlhe colonies, toro
posed by Hon. Joseph Onamberlain. Im
perial Secretary for the
result of the conference teis a â¢xv> 'blow
to the cause of Australian, union, for ahree
cut of five Premiers present refused to
accept the amendments azvu wouia noi
allow of any alteration to Jthe measure.
This action tends to defeat the union
for which the Imperial FedÂ«rati< nists
have been striving so long. The Preuilers
throw the blame for the defeat tjf tht,
project upon the Imperial. Government.
The principal amendment suggested by
Chamberlain is to the clause In tbw bill
which restricts the right of appeal *Â« the
Privy Council of Britain. The Impeâ¢^
Government strongly objects to tms
clause, and tho majority of the Australian
Premiers wish the rights of .appeal re_
stricted and the decisions of thv Supreme
Court of United Australia madevtfie
of last resort.
SIDE ENTRANCES
WILL BE CLOSED
BY THE POLICE
Saloon Men Are in Danger
of Forfeiting Their
Licenses.
"Side rooms to saloons must go. I am
bitterly opposed to them.and- intend to do
all In my power to suppress the ever
growing evil. Scarcely a day passes that
some Innocent girl Is not lured to these" 1
dens of iniquity and forced to drink even
against her will. I have determined t >
stop It. even at the cost of closing every
saloon In the city that maintains side en
trances," said Chief Sullivan last night.
He Is determined to prevent women
from entering the side rooms of saloons.
They may go In the front entrance and
take a drink, but cannot enter a aldfl
room, even If they are accompanied by
male escorts.
The Police Commissioners at their meet-
Ing last Tuesday night discussed the sub
ject at length end decided not to Isauo
a license to any saloon keeper who al
lowed women to enter the place.
"The Commissioners arc serious about
this matter." remarked the Chief last
night. "I have their sanction to go ahead
' and close up saloons that have side en
trances and I have determined to. do ?Â«Â».
A short time ago <'aptain Splllane and I
visited the saloons south of Market street
j and found a number of flagrant violation*
| of the ordinance relative to women beinj;
in saloons. In sever.il we found women.
, some Intoxicated, standing against the sa
loon bars accompanied by men and seek
ing more drinks. I Instructed Captain
Splllane to notify the proprietors not to
allow any women in their saloons, and I
think they have rigidly obeyed hla in
structions. If a woman wants a drink in
the future I Intend that sliÂ»> shall go in
the front entrance of a saloon, just as
a male patron would, and after drinking
what she ordered at once -leave the
place." â¢
In defense of their action the Commis
sioners cite the ordinance passed in 1^03
which reads Â«a follows: "No person en
paged In selling spirituous, malt or fer
mented liquors in quantities less than one
quart in any bar-room or saloon shall sell
any liquor In any *td* room, back room or
upper room, excepting only open alcovea
or booths; or shall lease or malntafn any
private or separate entrance for any par
Â¦ ticular class of customers, or display
words or signs upon an entrance signify
ing that such entrance is for ladles or
families or for any particular persons or
Is a private entrance to any saloon or
barroom."
Under the above ordinance Chief Sulll
' van is satisfied that he has the power to
close every side entrance to saloons. â¢?!â¢*
has already Instructed the officers to this
effect, with Instructions to report to him
the names of saloon keepers who havo
, side entrances to their places of business
' As soon as they appear before the Police
Commissioners for a renewal of their li
1 censes they will be promptly turned down
Rather than forfeit their licenses the
, Chief believes that in a short time Saa
I Francisco will be free from side entrances
to saloons.
Chief Sullivan Decides That Women
Who Want to Drink Will Not
BÂ« Allowed Any Special
Privilege.

Yellow Tail, Winner of the Inaugural Handicap,
ST. LOUIS, May 17.-The St. Louis
Fair Association inaugurated its an
nual spring 1 and summer meeting to
day under very favorable auspices.
The day was an Ideal one for the
sport, hut the track was four or five sec
onds slow, owins to the rains of the nipht
before. In consequence poor time was the
ruie. A biR crowd was present," notwith
standing the poor transportation facilities
to the fair grounds, the condition of af
fairs being caused by the street cat
strike.
Klffhteen bookmakers cut in and did a
rushing buslnepp. The only classic event
on th^ cardâ the Inaugural handicap
brought out a field of six only fair class
horses. Yellow Tail, the California-bred
colt, was the only hiph class animal In
the bunch, and on account of his good
performances on the Pacific Coast was
made premier choice at 8 to 5. Yellow Tail
showed his class by winning all the way.
Nandora was hopelessly beaten at the
quarter, but the balance of the field re
mained bunched behind the California
colt all the way to the wire. At the last
furlonff pole Matthews hrou&ht Thrive
out of the bunch with a rush and made a
game bid for the lead, but he could not
overtaJve the fiyinp leader. Yellow Tail
passing the post an open length in. advance
of Thrive, and he one and a half lengths
in front of Duke of Baden, third. The
timeâ liHUâ was good, considering the
condition of the track. Results:

A. L. AustirTs brown bitch Firm Foe
succeeded in capturing the midweek stake
at the Jngleside Coursing Park yesterday.
The Ftake winner secured her victory by
a narrow martriri. St. Anthony, the speedy
possession of X. P. Whitinjr, giving her a
close race for first honors. St. Anthony
was look?d upon as a certain winner.
That he failed was due to the fact that
he had stlffer courses than did Firm Foe.
The runner-uy proved himself a fine dog,
despite the hard woik he experienced. In
the final round he ran the victor an un-
Uicidevl and was only beaten for first
prize by one point The race between St.
Anthony and Firm Foe was certainly the
feature of the day. After a "no go." In
which both contestants scored four points
each, they were slipped to a fast "jack."
Firm Foe led up to and secured the turn.
She Rot possession and worked up to six
points, when St. Anthony made a brilliant
â¢ irlve, guinea popst-ssion and feld the hare
for three turns and dofeated his chances
of securing a ting by killing. Score 6 to 5.
The talent was in its element. Only a
few upsets were recorded, but none that
werr- serious.
Attorney Collins served a second Injunc
tion on the Chief of Police nnd the card
was run off without Interruption. Fol- j
lowing are the results of each race and ;

The liver is the biggest organ ln the
human body, and has lots of work to do.
It passes judgment on the food we eat,
separating the useful from the useless. AU
food must pass tho liver. All food must
go this onn way, and If the liver is lazy
and doesn't attend to its duties all the
Other organs suffer.
It is Just like stopping the engdne in a
factory. All the rest of the machines are
thrown out of work until it starts up
again.
Another duty of tho liver is to take the
bile out of the blood and send it into the
bowels, where it acts as a sort of lubri-
cant and helps the undigested matter out
of the body.
If the liver does not act properly the bile
goes wrong, remains in the blood, makes
yellow-greenish complexion, "liver spots,"
and causes all kinds of aches, pains and
sickness.
Tho liver must be kept lively and at-
tending to its duties, and the safest, sur-
est, simplest way is to use Cascarets
Candy Cathartic, the ideal laxative, agree-
able to the taste, convenient in form, an-
tiseptic and a fine stomach tonic. They
purify the blood, never grip nor gripe, and
do their work mildly but positively.
Buy and try Ca.scarets to-day. You'll
find that it's what they do, not what we
say they'll do, that proves their merit. All
druggists, 10c, 25c, 50c, or by mail for
prico. Send for booklet and free sample
Address Sterling Remedy Companv, Chi-
cago, Montreal. Can., or New York.

let. Every tablet of the only
genuino Cascarets bears the
magic letters "C C C." Look
at the tablet before you buy,
and beware of frauds, imita-
tions and substitutes.

The Board of Supervisors was to have
met last night as a committee of the
whole to hear eyldence^aa to the financial
condition of ihc various street railway
companies, but as there was no quorum
present an adjournment was taken until
next Monday afternoon. The considera
tion cf the Miguire standing fare ordi
nance was then tnken up by the Street
Committee. Supervisors Conner. Branden
stein. Dwyer. Booth and Maguire were
present and Mayor Phelan conducted the
examination of several street railway rep
resentatives. No .Information was "elicit
ed regarding the Market^street company,
as 'Its? attorney, J. H. Foulds, was re
ported to be ill.
Secretary Clayton of the San Francisco
and San Mateo road addressed the com
mittee at the request of the Mayor and
submitted facts and figures to prove that
the Maguire ordinance providing for a
2Vi cent standing fare was not only im
practicable, but would work an injustice
on his company, whose gross earnings
last year were only $35,000. The Mayor
asked Clayton if there was any objection
to the issuance of commutation tickets
at eight for 25 cents. Mr. Clayton replied
that the company would have to carry
28 per cent more passengers to offset the
loss resulting frcm the reduced rate. lie
further said that a street railway could
not carry passengers for less than 4 cents
each, and that no railroad was of any
use under the present law after the fran
chise had expired. Clayton disagreed
with the Mayor that the proper solution
of the problem waÂ« the municipal owner
ship of street railways. He contended
that proverbial municipal waste would
prevent the management of a public utili
ty as cheaply as it could be done as a
private corporation.
The committee was also addressed by
A. W. Harris, superintendent of the Cali
fornia-street road, and J. B. Leighton,
secretary of the Presidio and Ferries line.
Both made earnest protests against the
order and further consideration was post
poned until next Thursday morning, when
the Market-street officials are expected
to be present.

GANG OF BUNKO
MEN ROUNDED UP
BY THE POLICE
Leader Caught While Pre
paring to Fleece a
Stranger.
The police arrested a number of "sure
thing" ,men yesterday and are making a
determined effort to break up the gang
of bunko men who Infest the city. Their
names are Harry Walters, alias Major
Call, alias "Big Mit Harry": Frank Les
ler, alias Reynolds, alias Brown; Edward
Sheehan, alias "the Kid," alias "Sure
Thing" Sheehan: Charles Crawford, alias
Rounds, alias "Big Foot," alias "One-
Eyed Riley," and William Russell, alias
"Limpy," alias "the Swede with the ter
rible gall." Crawford and Russell were
arrested yesterday afternoon by Detective
Egan and charged with grand larceny.
Several days ago they visited a cigar
store at 304 Kearny street conducted by a
man named Albert Bear and "flim-flam
med" him out of $5. 'After discovering
his loss Bear reported the matter to the
police, and from a description of the two
men Detective Egan arrested Crawford
and Russell and charged them with the
crime. Last night they were positively
identified by their victim.
Subsequently, Lester and Sheehan were
taken into custody by Detective Egan and
locked up in the tanks. About a week ago
they met a recent arrival from the interior
named J. W. Smiley, who was about to
buy a ticket for Portland, Oregon, and in
duced him to visit a room at 632 Mission
street, where they claimed the agent was
Ftopping and that they could get him to
give him a ticket free of charge. Smiley,
seeing a chance to save the money that
was necessary to a trip to Oregon, readily
accompanied the two men to the room
where Uie agent of the railroad company
was supposed to have hi3 office. After
entering the room a game of cards was
proposed pending the arrival of the
"agent," and in a short time* Smiley lost
all the money he had, amounting to $63.
Suspecting he had been robbed he reported
the matter to the police with the result
that the two bunko men were taken Into
custody.
Walters, who the police say is the leader
of the gang, was found in a house on
Jones street. In his room was discovered
a complete outfit for swindling "tender
feet." There 1? a charge" of vagrancy al
ready pending against Walters, but never
theless he will be detained ln the tanks
until the case is disposed of.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CAIiL, FRIDAY, MAY 18, 1900.
The Public Buildings Committee of the
Board o* Supervisors met yesterday for
the purpose of devising means to hasten
the ccir.p!etioa of the Hall of Justice. It
Â¦was decided to base action upon the re
port of Architect Shea and J. F. Ken
r.edy of the Pacific Surety Company, who.
as Bateraan Brcs.' bondsmen, succeeded
.to their contract. This report will be sub
pitted at a meeting of the committee to
be held to-morrow morning and will con
tain an estimate or thÂ«s amount required
to Sr.ish the building in order that it
may be turned over to the city for occu
pancy.
This proposition was suggested by Au-
CXtor Wells as the best way out of the <iif
f.culty.
Auditor Wells opened proceedings by
elating that the construction fund of
$303,S23 had been exhausted by bills audit
ed and notices of claims against the fund
amounting to $53,000. The JS5.000 equip
ment and furniture fund was also nearly
exhausted. Chairman Dwyer stated the
original Bateman contract was for $:54,-
COu. and he desired to know where the
balance had gone. Wells replied that cer
tain contracts had been charged against
the construction fund that rightfully be
longed to the equipment fund. The Audi
tor declared his intention to audit no
inore bills until the building had been
turned over to the city.
Attorney Shadburne contended that the
Auditor had no right to hold up the Bate
man demands because sub-contractors
tad filed claims. The Pacific Surety Com
pany stood between th<, city and Bate
tnan Bros. It was not- the duty of the
Auditor to see that tlie Bateman bills
were paid. The first claim was that the
liuilding ehould be finished under the orlg
ir.al contract.
The Mayor held that the Batemans have
r.o claims. "The contract of the Bate
mans has lapsed," said Phelan. "and un
Â«3or its terms the surety company takes
their place."
Architect fihea thought the building
cculd be completed in three weeks. He
r> ad a statement which showed a surplus
of S12.7S2 after ail expenses had been paid.
He figured that it would cost $15OJ to lin-
Is^h the building. It was agreed that he
and Mr. Kennedy should investigate the
matter on those lines and report to-mor
row morning.
In the meantime the business men In
the vicinity of the Hall of Justice are
preparing for action of their own. They
have already formed an improvement club
known as the Forty-fifth District Club,
which has for Its principal object the set
tling of the hail dispute. They will
make it a matter of politics If it can be
dene in no other way, but one thing they
are determined upon â the hall must be
finished in short order or they will make
trouble.
Within a day or two a form of peti
tion will be ready for distribution. This
â¢will be sent all over the city for signa
tures. When as many signatures as pos
sible have been secured the petition will
be presented by a committee which will
see that it is not passed by lightly.

THE EMPORIUM.
THE EMPORIUM.
THE EMPORIUM.
THE EMPORIUM.Sometimes political orators feel more deeply than
they speak. Sometimes they forget the fashion of
the hour and speak more truthfully than they know.
If ever there was a political campaigner who spoke
from the bottom of his hcarKvvith a wish that was
surely father to the thought it was Grove L. John
son at Sacramento when he begged his hearefsto
"lit the dead past bury its dead."
The University of California has sent forth another
little army of student graduates, each armed with
clenched teeth and inflexible determination .to reform
a wicked world.
The ice trust in. New York is about the coldest
deal ever sprung upon the people of; that city, but
they are getting hot enough to melt, it.
S^\.\K 01 the marvelous organizations that are
I I characteristic of our time and our. country .is
v â^ that of the Christian Endeavor Association^
whose State convention is r><x:v in session at Stock
tcn. It :s but a fe-.v years since it was founded, and
already it numbers its members by the millions.
Moreover, it is advancing and augmenting with' a
rapidity which assures it a future even more remark
able than its brilliant ?.nd useful past.
The gathering at Stockton will show the strength
of the organization and make manifest the means by
which it has achieved so much. It has the double
vigor of Christian zeal and youthful ardor. Its mem
bership is made up of men and women who under
any circumstances would exert a potent influence in
their communities, and who, by the added strength
of unity of organization and harmony of sentiment,
have become among thÂ«r strongest factors which
.shape and control the development of the life of our
T]}e work of this and of similar associations is dis
tir.clly beneficial. It would be impossible to set
bounds to the good which such organizations work
in any community. Their influences extend far be
yond the reach <?f their energies, and by them life is
made happier ?nd better for many persons who never
at 2ny time in their lives come into direct contact
with the association that has helped them.
Stoclrton has given to the convention a reception
worthy of it. The true Californian spirit of hospi
tality has been shown in every phase of the arrange
ments made for the meeting. The occasion is there
fore one which will be remembered with gratification
hy all who share ia it cither as hosts or quests.
THE CHRISTIAN ENDEAVORERS.
THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FORESTS
AS a result of the campaign of education on the '
subject of forestry and the protection of our
woods, a movement has been started in the
East to bring about a reform in thepresent methods
of governmental administration of that department of
our affairs. Â¦ In this, as in many other respects, the
laws of the United States are more like a patchwork
of conflicting statutes than an orderly system of ad
ministrative control, and much of the inefficiency of
the Government in dealing with forestry problems is
d*ue to that cause.
Â¦ The administration of forests on the national do
main is commuted to the General Land Office. The
work of mapping and describing the reserve forests
is in the hands of the Geological Survey. The author
ity over forestry interests and the establishment of
relations between the Government and private own
ers of forests are in the hands of the forestry division
of the Department of Agriculture. Thus there are
three bureaus to supervise the one subject, and as an
inevitable consequence there is a degree of divided
responsibility and power which prevents good results.
It is asserted by the advocates of reform that the
control of the whole forestry problem should be
placed ifi the forestry division of the Department of
Agriculture, the argument being that the General<
Land Office is not capable of attending to it. Forest
administration is a matter of scientific management.
In fact, we have now reached a point in our develop
ment where trees will have to be regarded as grow
ing crops % and be carefully cultivated, just as fruit
trees are cultivated in orchards; so that the forests
will be renewed and not destroyed as, they have been
in the past. Such cultivation would of course be
more fitly placed under control of the Department of
Agriculture than of any other.
' Some time ago the forestry- division undertook to
. advance the science of forestry on a comprehensive
scale' by offering to co-operate with States and with
private owners in the care of woods belonging to
them. This offer has been promptly taken up, andi:
is said the division has now on file applications for
working plans from private owners of over 2,000,000
acres, and references from the Interior Department
covering 47,000,000 actes more. Thus it will be seen
the division is rapidly advancing! its work, for the
preservation of forests, while the General Land Office
has hardly done anything. That' showing in itself is
a strong argument in favor of vesting the entire con
trol of forests in the division, to the exclusion of any
other bureau whatever; for the department which does
the work should be that which has authority.
One of the speakers at the Huntingdon banquet
spoke eloquently on "cinders." The theme possibly
had something to do with that smoke which issues
not from engine stacks but from the law department
of the Southern Pacific Company.

CLARK OF MONTANA.
IS THE WORLD GROWING HAPPIER ?
By Susan B. Anthony.
the world growing happier? I will attempt to answer .
W m only for womankind. Yes, woman Is happier than ever
â. M before in the world's history, and this fact alone dem-
onstrates that the whole human family is happier and
better.
If man were growing worse and more miserable it would be
wholly Impossible for woman to be happy, for It is an axiom
as old as life itself that the two must rise or fall together.
Every organization of women in existence to-day is actu
ated by the same object that impelled Eve to eat the
appleâ a desire for knowledge â and every one is trying to
utilize this knowledge for the betterment of social conditions.
Even the anti-suffrage society, which might be considered an
exception to this rule, is trying to block the wheels of progress
because it believes that it 4s better for woman to bear the Ills
she has than fly to others that she knows not of.
This has been the situation during the past half century
whenever it was proposed to make any change in the condition
of woman: that it would bring discontent to her and unhappi
ness to the family; if she received an education It would unfit
her for the duties of wlfehood and motherhood; if the married
woman were permitted to own property she would desert her
husband and children; If those of the poorer classes were al
lowed to control their wages domestic chaos would result; if
women entered the trades and professions Immorality would
reign supreme.
In direct contradiction to these pessimistic forebodings
every progressive change In the condition of women has
brought to them an Immeasurable increase of happiness. The
only way in which even an approximate estimate of this can
be madÂ© is to imagine the present generation of educated.
property-holding, self-supporting, capable, independent women
suddenly transplanted into the condition of two generations
agoâ education, even in thÂ© common branches, placed beyond
their reach; every occupation closed to them except sewlngv
teaching and factory work; the wife robbed of her own prop
erty the moment she was married; the mother deprived of all
guardianship over her own children. It is Impossible to picture*
what would be their humiliation, their wretchedness, their de
spair. We would seo such a revolt, such a revolution, as tha
world has never known.
It Was only because women were taught It was the will of
the Creator that they should be in subjection, only because
they lacked a Moses to lead them out of the wilderness, that
they endured bo long and so patiently. But having emerged
at last and experienced the joy of even a partial liberty they
will not pause until they have attained the full happiness of,
complete freedom.
No one can observe the busy, broad and useful lives of tha
women of to-day, the Bplendld work they are doing for tha
world, without realizing the vastly increased happiness tha
closing years of the century have brought to them.
The gulf between us and our foremothers is no wider than
that which exists between ourselves and those future genera
tions who shall have an absolutely untrammeled opportunity
for development. This will be possible only when there shall
be placed upon the brow of woman the crown of citizenship
and sMe by side with man she may work for the regeneration
of the world, enforcing her will, as he enforces his, by tha
supreme authority of the ballot. The most powerful pea can
not put into words the happiness which will come to woman,
and through her to the race, when this right is hers.

THE Oakland Enquirer hears, and notes, that the
delegation to the Republican National Conven
tion, elected at Sacramento, proposes to elect
Dan Burns as member of the National Committee.
This is entirely probable, and would be in line with
the sinister course of politics heretofore taken by that j
clement which 'dominated in the personalities of the
convention.
The evil qualities in a party must ferment them
selves out, as does feculence in water. The personal
incidents at Sacramento were the last efforts of that
element in California Republicanism. Tihat kind of
work is the only kind of which it is capable, and there
need be no surprise that it acts that way. If any
blame attach anywhere, it is to the indifferent mem
bers of the party who permit it, and then wonder why
victories come so hard and so high, and why so often :
they come not at all. If the act of the convention
toward individuals were really expressive of its ideas
and purposes, of its party loyalty, and of its opinion
of the uses to which a party should be put, the elec
tion of Burns as National Committeeman is a per
fectly fit conclusion. True, it 'may alienate votes, it
may chill influences much needed to 6ecure success
next fall; it may disgust Republicans to the point of
defaulting at the polls, and may turn away from us
the self-respecting independent vote â but if it is in
line with the genius of the convention no one need
be surprised. J.t will simply prove that the forces
which were not ftrong enough to debauch and de
stroy the party in the Legislature were capable of the
lesser exertion and lighter task of doing it untimely
harm in its convention- During the session of that
body The Call and its proprietor were under discus
sion, provoked by attacks coming from the Burns
boss machine of San Francisco. This discussion
turned upon support of the party policy. There is
one point in that policy at which the entire attacking
force of the Bryanists will be aimed. Every intelli
gent Republican knows what that point is. The Porto
Rican tariff, a tentative measure to give the country
time to study its new responsibilities and the method
of meeting them, has already been selected as the
weak place in the Republican works upon which the
guns of the enemy will be trained. As was truly
said in the convention, at that point The Call has al
ready gathered and put in action the means of de
fense. What other strong Republican agency has
done this? From what other have succors and re
inforcements appeared? The Call represents no per
sonal ambitions, of its proprietor or any other. But
it does represent loyalty to the Republican party and
devotion to its interests, and the statement made to
the convention that it has the sympathy and support
therein of forty-nine out of every fifty Republicans in
the State is undoubtedly true. Turning it down, then,
is not a vengeful victory over any man's ambition,
but. the act stands as public punishment administered
by a convention for having represented the wish and
the welfare of forty-nine fiftieths of the party. The
Call is not injured, and its proprietor has lost nothing
of the least personal consequence to him. But the
convention has made the party seem to repudiate and
spit upon its own professions, and treat as punishable
offenses those things which it approves as most
needed to make it strong and successful. This is the
harm that is done. To elect Burns only makes that
barm plainer, and the need of The Call and the pro
priety of its course more apparent
We stand ready to do our part of the increased
labor made necessary to carry the State. We are
prepared to shoulder our part of the unnecessary
burden with which the election of Burns will handi
cap the party, for we realise that what is done and
what is threatened means the last- appearance of
Burns and his influence in the organization. As we
toiled to avert the greater danger of his election to
the Senatorship, we will do what we can to nullify
and cancel the lesser danger of his recognition by
the delegation. .Having saved a city from being
sacked and burned by a freebooter, the good soldier
does not complain of the lesser duty of protecting it
from burglars.
It is a proper illustration of the Burns methods that
no rumor of his ambition to be a member of the Na
tional Committee was permitted to escape before and
during the convention- So his Senatorial candidacy
was kept under close cover until the party had left
the polls a winner in 1898. Then when the chance to
get an expression upon his ambition had passed the
cover was lifted and the conspiracy was disclosed.
The proprietor of The Call submitted himself to
the suffrage of the convention openly as a Republican,
was defeated as a Republican, and remains a Republi
can.
That is not the Burns way. His bossism is of a
peculiar kind. It wears a mask- It, follows gopher
politics. It practices concealment. It lures others to
exertions and, when they -succeed, suddenly jumps
from ambush and snatches from them the results.
We are convinced that it played its last engage
ment on the boards at Sacramento, and that hereafter
when its revenges are put in action the party will
inquire into its purposes and compel their disclosure.
The Republican party, under the circumstances,
needs more than ever the loyalty and labor of the
men who are intellectually joined to its fortunes.
The Call has not overestimated their influence, for
it has done nothing and can do nothing without them.
The party was born of the purposes of such men.
It was brought into being in a high cause, as the crea
tion of men who were glad to sacrifice themselves for
it, to spend and be spent in its promotion. It was not
whelped like a mongrel, to be used for the profit of
the base.
THE LATE CONVENTION.
TriE BILLBOARD ORDINANCE.
THE ordinance recommended the other day by
the Judiciary â Committee of the Board of Su
pervisors legalizing advertising fences twenty
feet in height not only does not meet the popular de
mand for an abatement of the billboard nuisance, but
it is a positive concession to the bill-stickers. In
deed, the ordinance will, if passed, -fasten high ad
vertising fences permanently upon the city.
As the law stands at present there is no legal au
thority for the erection of these fences. If one of
them should fall and break the crown of an incau
tious pedestrian a suit for damages would lie against
the bill-poster or property-owner. But if the fences
are legalized and inspected by the municipal authori
ties, as is proposed by the ordinance, it may and
probably will be contributory negligence to walk on
their side of the street or venture within striking
distance of them.
If these unsightly and unwholesome nuisances must
be tolerated in the interest of the bill-posting firms
which have influenced the Judiciary Committee to
report this ordinance, they should be limited to ten
feet in height and forbidden on all the principal
thoroughfares. Fences ten. feet high could probably
be constructed so as to be comparatively safe, and
certainly such a 6pace ought to accommodate
enough illuminated literature to satisfy the demands
of the cigar, sodawater, circus and cigarette loving
t public. The paste and filth emanating from a ten
foot fence might, indeed, be reduced to a minimum
by careful inspection.
But fences which tower twenty feet in the air
should not be permitted under any circumstances.
No matter how securely such contrivances are con
structed, they are always a menace to the lives of
pedestrians, and it is little less than an outrage for
the Judiciary Committee to even contemplate yield
ing them to . the bill-posters. There is no doubt
whatever that the people who advocate the suppres
sion of the advertising fence nuisance in this city
would prefer no legislation at all to the passage of
this ordinance, which authorizes the fences, and to
that extent indorses them. A crusade against cap
ping for faro which would result in legalizing the
game arid prescribing conditions under which it
might be played would bear considerable resemblance
to the consideration which the Judiciary Committee
has shown these billboard pests. The Phelan ad
ministration has already presented the town with sev
eral disconcerting legislative gifts. If it is sufficiently
bold to confer upon it twenty-foot advertising fences
the zenith of impudence may be considered to have
been reached.
If the Supervisors are in any doubt as to the sen
timent pi the people with reference to the billboard
abomination let them poll a few blocks inhabited by
intelligent citizens. We venture the prediction that
nine out of every ten persons casually encountered
will declare that advertising fences are dirty, un
healthy, unsightly and dangerous, and that they
ought to be abolished. Such being the case, ther;
should be no hesitation in adopting measures neces
sary to suppress or at least restrict them.
San Francisco, it may be added, does not exist for
the benefit of bill-stickers, nor yet for the profit of
the unprogressive property-owners who are encour
aged to maintain unimproved lots by the revenue de
rived from a tall fence covered with advertisements of
sodawater, cigarettes and alcoholic drinks. This city
is organized and conducted as a place of residence for
peaceful people, intent on extracting as much com
fort from life as possible. It is an insult to the in
telligence of these men and women to insist that the
town shall be covered with paste and paper and the
streets made dangerous to travel by the presence
upon the sidewalks of billboards twenty or even ten
feet high.
If the bill-stickers cannot be entirely suppressed
they should be driven off the principal streets and
restricted to low and safe fence3.
THE SAN FRANCISCO, CALL, FRIDAY, MAY 18, 1900.
6
IX the experience of more than a century it was be
lieved that there was nothing left untried and un
heard of in American politics. It was thought
that everything that can occur in the friction of the
ambitions of men had been recorded. In the many
contested cafes in the House and Senate it seemed
that cver\- sharp practice, every means of persuading:
voters, miscounting votes, sophisticating returns, im
pressing legislators, coaxing, persuading, intimidat
ing, or driving and leading folks to get there, had
been exhausted, and that future aspirants must be
:;icre!y imitators. But all this is proved to be a mis
take.
The case of Senator Clark of Montana presented
the old catalogue of methods, with much picturesque
ness, it is true, derived from the wild and unfettered
ways of the West. It was the same text, dependent
for any new charm upon the ability and originality of
the actors, just as "La Tour de Xesle" played by ex
perts is a tragedy, but by barnstormers becomes a
farce.
The Senate had about decided to declare a vacancy
in the seat held by Mr. Clark when he rose and re
signed. He did it wcU, for he is really a man of qual
ity, and has culture, force and excellent intellectual
training. He submitted to the Senate his defense in
a statement that for clearness and force would do no
discredit to any member of that body, and without a
i-ish hid oft his toga and quit. The Senate felt re
lieved. It was spared the rollcall to vote him out
It rather liked him. anyway, and heard him with re
spect and parted with him with regret.
But the curtain had hardly run down on the scene
tv-.til the bell tinkled and up it went again, disclosing
Mr. C!ark, ail togaed again and bearing the appoint
ment and commission as Senator, bestowed by the
acting Governor of Montana! The Governor, thrifty
soul, was down in California attending to his private
law business for a client The Lieutenant Governor
jjjid the great seal and other muniments of power and
used them to reinvest Mr. Clark with the Senator
Â«.hip. It was the happening of the unexpected, the
appearance of something new in American politics.
No one questions the authority of the acting Gov
ernor to make the appointment. Mr. Clark had been
sworn into the Senate, had held a scat and vacated it
by resignation. The vacancy happened during a re
cess of the Legislature, and the Governor, acting
under the fresh decision in the Quay case, appointed
The question presented is most interesting. , It does
credit to the genius of Mr. Clark. It is novelty it
self. The whole country will look with interest upon
the subsequent proceedings.

Is beautiful, but we. are not photographing
color.
In determining whether or not a land
scape is worth photographing the three
following principles should be applied:
First, long distance scenes are beat avoid
ed, as when reproduced on paper the
charm of distance is apt to be lacklner.
"Little bits," something inclosed in the
compass of a few square yards, are ever
so much more suitable for the camera.
Figure 1 illustrates a long-distance view,
but it depends for -more than half its ef
feet on the white on the head and baok
of the figure In the foreground. This can
easily be proved by placing one finger on
the white mass and at once the "lire" of
the picture is gone. .
The second point is an analysis of the
material to see what it consists of. Earth,
trees, water, skyâ these aru tne possible
and always present constituents, and no
landscape picture is ever really satisfac
tory if one or more be wanting. I think
it is due to the fact that earth represents
the most stable condition we know in this
world â the eternal hills Ideaâ while water
represents the unstable â "unstable as
water, thou shalt not excel"â and In be
tween we have the vegetation. Clouds
are not of the earth: they are above it
literally and metaphorically, and they
represent the moods of our feelings from
grave to gay. So, as far as possible, get
water. and clouds In your pictures; espe
cially get water, clouds if you can. The
next point that demands attention Is the
composition. This phase I dealt with in
my second article. â¢
;Â¦-Â¦ Supposing . the scene to be one suitable
for good pictorial work and that the com-
Qo&itJon is rood. then. comes up the most
say. Do not suppose that it is necessary
to travel hundreds of miles to get suitable
material for picture-making. If you hava
the right kind of eyes you will rtnd plenty
of material right at your own door.

kinds of "whaleback" that have come to
Ban Francisco. Loaded she looks like a
house submerged to within a few feet of
the eaves, but standing high in the water
she appears something like a steamer.
What the Universe lacks In appearance,
however, she makes up in economy and
capacity. She carries 4000 tons dead
weight and makes from 216 to 220 knots on
a consumption of fourteen tons of Cardiff

requires no trimmers, as owing to the pe
culiar construction of the vessel the cargo
trims itself. She requires a very small
crew to hAndle her and. all in all, she is
the most economic craft on the coast to

Steamer Universe, ;the Strangest Looking Whaleback Afloat
If the police are looking for one Clrilo
J. Elorduy, who figures In a morning
newspaper story as attempting to lure
Josie Davis, a Tivoli chorus girl, from
her happy home, they can find him day or
night at his residence, 49 Third street.
Despite much journalistic hullabaloo the
young man declares he has yet to discover
evidence of policemen's tracks and the de
tectives are equally ignorant of any de
mand for Elorduy's presence at the City
Hall.
At any rate the alleged disturber of
chorus girls' quiet desires to afford the
police or any one else who care* to find
him every facility, as he has nothing to
conceal or to befog concerning his deal
ings with the members of the Tivoli
chorus or the attaches of the theater.
Elorduy has a foreign accent, wears
Paris-made garments, sports some big
diamonds, gets money from home and for
several months has been a conspicuous
occupant of the second orchestra row of
the Tivoli Opera-house.
"I didn't think it wrong to go as often
as I pleased," said Elorduy last night.
"Sometimes the musicians and the play
ers would smile at me. I first noticed
Miss Davis about four weeks ago and
thought there was no harm In sending
flowers and Invitations to her after she
had appeared to reciprocate my smiles.
I wrote many note3 to her, but received
no .answer. The reason I got her ad
dress was because I thought that the
theater might not be the proper place
to meet her in the event she should de
sire to become acquainted with me. I
never represented myself as the son of
any consul or any count. I speak Rus
sian, French, English and Spanish and I
don't care whether I was considered a
native of any one of the countries where
those tongues are spoken.
"My father is a wealthy official of
Mexico and I receive remittances from
him. I came to San Francisco to study
at the Union Iron Works, but now I am
tutor to a private family. The reason I
used names other than my own was to
protect my family name. I used the
name of 'Derby' to reserve seats at the
theater because it was easy, and the
ticket sellers used to Introduce me by
that name. I am not a criminal, nor have
I committed any crime In trying to make
the acquaintance of Mis3 Davis. I am
not hiding from the police or any one else.
I regret that my actions should have
caused Miss Davis any mental distress.

Landscapes, after all. form the steady
diet of the amateur photographer, and it
must be said that in this branch of the
art the amateur is ahead of the profes
sional. But It must not be supposed for
one moment that all amateurs make bet
ter landscape pictures than do profession
als, but a few amateurs do make really
fine work, and there is nothing to prevent
the many succeeding as well as do the
few. It is all a matter -of brains. The
vast majority, however, are too lazy in
tellectually, as I said before, and they Jog
along, exposing hundreds of plates, hoping
some day by accident to get at least one
fine picture. But accidents of that kind
do not happen very often. One of my

the framework; lighting 13 the flesh and

In portraiture it was comparatively easy
to take a scheme of lighting that was ad
mirably fitted to bring out all the detail
and character in a face and to show how
It could be secured. But In landscape it
is different. Here we are more anxious
to get effects than facts, and the beÂ£t ef

to photograph It every hour of.ths day
from 8 a. m. to 6 p. m. He swallowed thÂ»
prescription and Ire assures me he learned
more In these ten hours than he had
learned in months of reading and study.
I fancy it would not hurt any of my read
ers to take the Same course.
But let us get down to more specific
details, and the first ia a "don't." Don't
have the sun behind your back when ex
posing. You must have light and shada
in your photograph, and the sun behind
your back will give you all light and no
shade. Far rather have the sun right
ahead of you, for this will give you lots
of both light and shade, not only In the
masses of foliage in the distance, but.
more important still. In the grass and *
flowers In the near foreground, where de
tail and relief are usually much wanted.
Figures 1 and 2 illustrate this very
clearly.
I fancy I see you conjure up visions of
fog on your plate as a consequence of
facing the sun, but that will not happen
if you are careful. Before you malte the
exposure hold the slide of your platf
holder .or your hat so as to shield, tha
lens from the direct rays and go ahead.
It Is simply astonishing how judicious
lighting will make a charming picture
out of the most unpromising material.
What could be more commonplace than
the material shown in Figure 3. yet by
having the light fall on It from the risrht
front the result Is an exceedingly pleasing
effect. It often occurs that an unbroken,
uninteresting expanse of snow in the fore
ground becomes an interesting part of the
picture simply by getting trees not shown
at all to cast their shadows across It.
There is absolutely no excuse for bare,
uninteresting foregrounds when a few
shadows drawn by the pencil of light can
transform them into things of beauty.
And speaking of foregrounds. let ma
make my last point. A picture to be suc
cessful must have foreground, middle dis
tance and distance. I regret to say that
I find very rarely more than two in the
average photograph. If the foreground
be good and distance be shown the mldctlo
distance is lacking. But the average fore
ground Is no foreground at all, but sim
ply an evenly tinted, uninteresting pieco
of paper. Fancy the lower part of Figura
3 all an even mass of white. By no stretcli
of Imagination could it be dignified wit a
the title of foreground, yet It occupies tnÂ»
place of one.' But as the picture id. from
nearest point to farthest, there 13 a fore
ground, a middle distance and a distance. -
I have told you all that was In my mind
when I sat down to write, but I have not
told you all there i3 to be learned about
landscape photography. All I have dona
is to give you an appetizer, and I trust
that you will be tempted to do your own,
experimenting. But one thing more I will
ly great hustlers physically, and I admire
the energy with which they cover weary
miles or spend hours developing and print
ing. I am built the other way about, and
am a sincere admirer of the man who.
when he has a half-hour job, will sit
down for a whole hour and figure out how
he can do it in ten minutes with the least
expenditure of exertion. My wife. I frank
ly confess, calls this laziness. I call it
conservation of energy.
The first thing to be considered in a
landscape scene is the general mass of the
material stretched out In front. It is at
tractive to the eye, doubtless, but that
Is not the point, we have to consider how
It will look In black and white. The color
philosophical friends insists that it always
takes three conditions to make an acci
dent, but I think an accidentally good
landscape photograph would be thÂ© out
come of at least four if not half a dozen.
There must needs be a good composition,
effective lighting, the camera at the right
spot at the right moment, correct ex
posure, proper development and a first
rate print on suitable paper. Mathemati
cal readers â¢who are posted on the laws of
combinations and permutations might for
the good of humanity figure out how often
In an average amateur's lifetime the con
ditions would be right for the making of a
fine picture â by accident.

erpool was a little higher, but later the weather
conditions pointed to rain In the thirsty North
west and the ideas concerning the present
wheat value shrank somewhat. July opened
unchanged at 66SiÂ«667Â»c, touched 66:4c, turned
tail and slid down to 66V4c. with very little
support. Traders were Inclined to agree with
the Price Current's opinion that the past week
had been with a few exceptions favorable to
the crop. July firmed up somewhat during the
last half hour in sympathy with corn, closing
at 06V;C, a loss of *' 5 c to Me from yesterJay.
The corn market was somewhat irregular,
there being spots of weakness and others of
strength. The opening was firm on higher
cables, but shortly afterward turned weak,
many selling in sympathy with the wheat de
cline. Later, after various demonstrations, the
price was carried back to where it was at the
close, last night. July closing unchanged, at 3ic
Oats followed corn throughout. The trading
was very narrow. July closing unchanged.
Provisions oDened lower because hog receipts
were large and prices at the yards softer, but
held steady after the first concession, there be
ing a fair demand and a better export inquiry
July pork closed ~\^c under yesterday, lard a
shade lower and ribs unchanged.

NEW YORK. May 17.-Th* demand for rail
road stocks, which has sr^vfn ttrength to the
markft for a number of days past, has been |
fBt;sÂ£ed crfl prices f^l! back to-day in that de- ]
partment <">f the etock l!?t. This is accepted ;
In Wall Ftr^f-t as confirmation of the view that
d'Trar.d came from an outstanding fthcrt'lntei-
in the CtTcst and w&u not baÂ»-Â«d on any un
iderljinfr condlti'-o in the companies whosw?
Btocks wrm afTected or In business at laree.
The market iljiwed itself as Indifferent to-day
to one or two favorable factors which developed
at It was yesterday to any depressing influ
Â«iwf. The outvide public remains jirofoundiy
tndifTerent to the stock market find commission
houee burinÂ»>ss has fallen to practically nothing.
Humors of th*> same kind as thr>r-e which served
th* purjif^e of the bulls \ester<lay continued to
circulate. su<~h as that Union Pacific or Penn
sylvania were to i*cure control of Burllncton !
or AtchiEun preferred was tp receive Its full
dividend or new millionaire Interests were to
lie reorescnted in Missouri Pacific, but all of
thf-se stories were hoard with languid Interest
and prices continued to drocp. In the Industrial
litt the losses In prices were not such a passive
matter. American Tcbarco was under severe ':
X'retsjsure y.'l day on account of circumstantial !
assertions o* the organization of formidable '
competition. The- stock lest over 6 points, clos
ing Â£t tl.e lowest. Sugar suffered from reports
that the trade was to sfsumi> a more acute
ftare. People's Gas continued under pressure
liy the professional element amonÂ« the traders.
An advance in the price of copj>e.r was respon
fornÂ» sentimental effect on the stocks of other
metal ccmranies. The stocks in that trroup
Tvere dull and the movement very uncertain,
the news concerning the Iron tra^e continulne
generally untavorable. Beth the Bank of Eng
land and the Bank of France made stronz
weekly returns and the money conditions in
Ixtndon and Paris showed relief accordingly.
The probability of other gold exports from here
Is thus rtin-.inished. The local money market
continued Aery easy ar.d It is evident that the
e 'Â¦',â¢'. export has been offset by gains from other
sources.
The bend market was decidedly duM. but
showed some advances. Total sales, par value.

CLOSING.
The market h?re was firm to-day, encouraged
by the war news, decided improvement being
recorded In Westralians, where the dreaded
failures were averted. Other favorable in
fluences were extreme easy money and the
strong bank return. Americans were bought
throughout the session, the Continent assist
ing. Dividend expectations was the chief in
fluence. London wanted Atchlson issues for
this season. Tlntos spurted sharply on pur
chases by English bears, who were discouraged
by the fortnightly statistics. New York bought
Anacondas here. Discount houses reduced de.
posit rates one-half and there was some talk
of a -reduction next week of the bank rate,
it is Improbable, however, that this will be
done while the war lasts. The Bank of Ben
gal reduced its discount rates from 6 to 5 per

Attorney Boyd Will Seek to Make the
Pump Gun Decision Apply to
Set Nets.
Special Disrateh to The Call
SAN RAFAEL, May 17. -Attorney
Thomas P. Boyd of this place will spring
a legal surprise shortly when he applies
to the United States Circuit Court for a
writ of habeas corpus on behalf of his
clients, twenty-live Chinese fishermen.
These Chinamen were arrested by Fish
Commissioner" Davia last Sunday and
charged with using set nets for the catch
ing of shrimps. Attorney Boyd will base
his appeal for a writ of habeas corpus on
the decision of Judge Ross rendered yes
terday in the "pump-gun" case. In this
Case his Honor decided that the Marin
County game law proscribing: the use of
a "pump-euti" was invalid. He states in
his decision that no laws can be laid down
as to the manner in which game shall be
taken or caught. This judgment certainly
appears to knock the props from under
the State game laws and aJso leaves the
Fish Commission without a leg- to stand
on. "If the decision of Judge Itoss is car
ried to Its logical conclusion." said Dis
trict Attorney Mclsaac to-day, "the State
has no case against the Sshermen charged
with uping set nets, as according to the
judgment freedom of choice In regard to
the manner used In taking game Is, In
spite of the game laws, every citizen's
prerogative." v-'\

National Guardsmen Unable to Pa
rade With Full Banks to Cele

The officers of the First Regiment, N, G.
C, are in a quandary because of the lack
of uniforms for the command. Whilo the
regiment is under orders to parade on
Memorial day, the men have nothing with
which to make a showing, epecept such
uniforms as have been saved from the
Philippine campaign. The State has not
issued a now uniform or any other equip
ment to the reorganized regiment.
The officers doubt whether more than a

Suit Brought in the District Court by
Rauer, Gamage and
Tyndall.
Jake Rauer. Jule Gamage of Harding's
Collection Agency and George YV\ Tyndall
& Co. filed a petition yesterday in the
United States District Court to have
Charles Montgomery declared an invol
untary insolvent.
They allege that Montgomery com
mitted an act of insolvency by concealing
some of his property, and they further
declare he owes them- together JPOO
Judge de Haven denied the petition be
cause it had not been drawn in proper
form, but the petitioners have leave to
file an amended petition.
The $1200 represents various debts, one
of which is a note for $250 indorsed by
Montgomery and held by Gamage. Mont
gomery says there Is nothing more than
a technicality In the allegation that he
has concealed any property, for. he says.
"I have no property to conceal." He had
not been served with summons in the
case nor/ he pays, has he been pressed for
the debts the petitioners hold against
him.
WOULD FORCE INSOLVENCY
UPON C. MONTGOMERY
-OAKLAND, May 17.â The management
of the Bank of Livermore and the busi
ness of that institution In general was the
point that occupied the lawyers in the liti
gation over the Varney estate to-day.
Excert C. D. Stuart was examined at
lensth in regard to the affairs of the bank,
which' he had examined into. The expen
was subjected to a rigid examination and
w\s asked to explain what he had learned
from his Inspection of the books of the
"fn answer to Attorney Reed. Stuart said
his investigations extended over the years
from ISM to 1900, and that during that time
the average amount of deposit per year
was $198,000.
"What is the condition of the resources
of tho bank as compared with the re
sources In 1S94?" asked Attorney Reed.
"The real estate has increased and the
overdrafts have decreased." answered
Stuart. "The overdrafts in 1894 amounted
to $65,000, and In 1900 they amounted to
only $17,000." .
At this point in the expert's testimony
Judge Seaweil suggested that It would be
well to have. a detatled account of his in.
spectlon of the bank's accounts. Before
giving a detailed statement Stuart re
maikpd that he had found the accounts
perfectly straight.
Banker W. G. Henshaw was called this
afternoon and testified that he did not
think that Pitcher's salary of $4000 a year
as. president of the bank was unreason
able.

Stolen Smacks Not Defined
in the Codes of
Alameda.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
HIS Broadway. May 17.
In Alameda kissing is either disturbing
the peace or battery and sometimes both.
In the case of John Kelly, who was ar
rested last night for forcibly kissing Mr9.
Isabella Brock, it was ootn, possibly be
cause Mrs. Brock is young and good
looking and because Kelly got more than
cne kiss.
No matter what the cause of Kelly's
trouble, he certainly got the kisses and
got In jail for taking them.
Justice Morris, before whom the villain
Is to be tried. v;il\ be under tne necessity
of deciding just what kind of a crimo
kissinp In Alameda may be. JudRv- St.
Sure iÂ» goins to sit in the case with him.
for the question at issue is a very im
portant one.
The case has assumed importance, for
it will be of great interest to the rest of
the State to know just what Alameda
considers' a kiss to be â whether battery,
disturbing tho peace or just nothing at
all. The story of how Kelly called at
the residence of Mrs. Brock and finding
her alone stole a few kisses and a him
or two ami was arrested therefor has
been told in The Call already.

CHINESE BOSS EMPLOYS
JAPANESE CHEAP LABOR
/f=S\ AKLAND, May 17.â Over in Ala
( Jj tne<la the labor question has be
'xtr^ come most involved. There are
many vegetable gardeners In the
encinal city." most of whom come from
the Cp!e.Â»;hÂ»l Kingdom, and the Alameda
"Man With a Hoe" wears a pigtail and
a basket-Hat and hi? eyes are more slant
ed tack than his brow, while a far-away
"yenshee" look comes Into his face when
the A!an:ed:i Angelus bell announces that
it is time to knock off work. Most of these
vegetable gardens have fallen into the
hands of Quong Fat, who comes from Can-
ton, but who has learned the way to
wealth very rapidly.
Quong Fat has employed a large force
of his countrymen at a salary of 70 cents
a day and rice, the' employes agreeing to
furnish their own "yenshpe." A few days
ago Quong Fat discovered that he could
secure other "men with hoes" at a very
much less rate, and he opened negotia
tions with a Japanese labor bureau. He
did not let patriotism stand in the way of
business. He has discharged all of his
Chinese employes and closed a contract
with the Japanese, who have agreed to
work for 50 cents a day. Quong Fat de-
clares that he will have no Chinese union
labor on his place.
The Chinese discovered the little game
I and have organized the Alameda high
1 binders" tong No. 1. They have established
i a boycott upon Quong Fat and his gar
| dens and moved across the Alameda veldt
yesterday afternoon upon the trenches of
the usurpers. They stormed the kopjes
and a small riot ensued. In which the Ala
| meda police were requested to take a
hand. The Japanese were outnumbered
for the time being, but Quang Fat car
ried the day. He has announced his In
tention of employing no more Chinese
high-priced union labor, but will employ
only Japanese cheap labor.
Mrs. Beatrice Priest Fine, the favorite
California soprano, is making an envia
ble position for herself in the metropolis.
It has long been understood that Mrs.
Fine had leanings toward the operatic
stage, and New York critics are now say
ing that she is as "charming and compe
tent an actress as she is distinguished as
a vocalist." This criticism refers" to her
rendition of the soprano rote in "Iolan
the." Mrs. Fine is also soloist of the
First Unitarian Church of New York and
has. besides, all the concert work that
she can undertake.
Louis Heine, our well-remembered 'cel
list, is coneertizing in New York, after a
season spent in Pittsburg with the sym
phony orchestra of Victor Herbert. .
Mrs. Olive Reed Cushrr.an. the contralto,
and Miss Grace Carroll are studying in
Xew York with Thtodor Bjorksten. Mrs.
Cushman holds a good church position
and Miss Carroll among other church
work has recently substituted for Annie
Louise Clary.
Miss Evelyn Henry, another Bjorksten
pupil, has just given a, most successful
recital in New York. Miss Henry, with
Mr. Bjorksten. gave the duet from "Ca
vallcria Rusticana." and the young Cali
fornian's voice and interpretations arous
ed much flattering comment. She will
spend the summer in Bar Harbor, where
sh<Â» has many important engagements for
tht- holiday season.
Miss Hilda Newman, formerly a mem-j
ber of the Cheney Amateurs of San Fran
cisco and now pianist ot the Ladles' Trio
traveling with Lilian Carllsmilh. is rest-
ing in New York, after a most successful
tour. This distinguished pupil cf Les
chetizky conceives of rest as an eight
hours' daily practice.
. Maud Lilian Berri (Mrs. Fisher), a for
mer favorite of San Francisco and now.
of the Castle Square Opera Company,
New York, is in San Francisco. Leander
Richardson says of her: "Miss Berri is
a distinguished acquisition to the Castle
Square forces. â¢ â¢ â¢ She learns a new
role with marvelous rapidity and has im
proved amazingly since her ilrst hit as
Siebel in 'Faust.' "
The Wagner lectures given at Golden
Oate Hall by Mrs. Mary Fairweather
have created much favorable comment.
Her subjects for exposition were the
"Niebelungen Lied" and "Parsifal." The
remaining lectures of the series will deal
with art and literature. Browning's "Ring
and the Book" and Goethe's and other
"Fausts," from Ciprianus to present era.
William B. King-, the organist, gave a
recital at Grace Church on Tuesday last.
Mr. King's programme consisted almost
entirely of the compositions of his dis
tinguished maitre. M. Charles M. Wldor,
and M. Caesar Franck. The brilliant and
masterly handling of his noble instrument
by this young Californian delighted his
audience "and gave rise to regret that our
organists are so seldom heard in recital.
From New York to Boston, to Chicago,
all over the Kast. the organ recital is a
most favored and certainly admirable
form of entertainment, and there is no
question' but that we have here both in
struments .and talent that will compare
favorably with any city m the Union.

master. .,
The following Postmasters have been
corr.misisoned: "Walter M. Burckhalter.
Truckee; Enoch B. Pixley, Castle Crag;
Bertha Plymale, Watsonvllle, Or.
The postoffices at Oxnard and Mountain
Villa, Cal., will become Presidential on
July 1, and the salaries of the Postmasters
will be $1400 and $1000 respectively.
The bill providing for the emergency
river and harbor work, and for certain sur
veys, which passed the House to-day,
authorizes surveys contemplating the Im
provement of Oakland harbor and San
Joaquin River, Cal., and Tacoma harbor.
Washington. It also appropriates $10,000
for the purchase of land necessary foi
the construction of debris dams and im
pounding works, with an equal amount
appropriated by the State of California.
Provision is also made for removing cer
tain rocks in Yaquina Bay, Oregon.
Chairman Burton stated the engineers
had reported against the Jl.030,000 project
for the improvement of Yaquina Bay, and
personally he favored its abandonment.
Mr. Burton said . the regrular river and
harbor bill would be reported early next
session.
The Ways and Means Committee has

mer to consider the question of the re
duction of the war revenue tariff and give

OF INTEREST TO THE
PEOPLE OF PACIFIC COAST
sul General Gudger.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. May 17.â Because It has
no vessel available the Navy Department
has informed Secretary Hay that it is im
possible to comply with the request of
Consul General Gudger to dispatch a war
ship to Panama. The gunboat MachJas
left Port Iimon yesterday for Colon via
Boca del Toro, and upon arrival at her
destination will, If necessary, land ma
rines for the protection of the railway.
Tha latest Information- of the State De
partment Indicates that the . revolution
ists are not sufficiently well equipped to
lay siege to Panama, and if a Dattle oc
curs at that point it Is not expected that
the American legation and American in
terests will be endangered. If necessary
a guard from the Machlas can he sent
over the road from Colon to Panama.
The visit of the Machias to Boca del
Toro is explained by the State Depart
ment as due to the fact that the Colom
bian revolution was organized near that
point, at David, which was the destina
tion of the flllbustertmj expedition from
Nicaragua, and Commander L. C. Logan,
commanding the gunboat, will ascertain
there what progress the revolution has
made. It is said at the State Department
that there is no danger of trouble, between
Colombia and Nicaragua in consequence
of the departure of the filibustering expe
dition from the latter country, as the
Bogota Government ia too much - en
grossed with its efforts to suppress insur
rection. If any dispute occurs It will
come only in case Colombia should quell
the revolution. The good offices of the
United States have not been Bought in the
matter.

OUTPOURING OF
ELOQUENCE IN
THE FAIR CASE
Yesterday was a day of brilliant argu
ment in Judge Troutt's court. Two of
the leading attorneys for the Fair heirs,
Garrett McEnerney and ex-Governor
James H. Budd, occupied the day. The
two legal stars were accorded deep atten
tion from 9 o'clock in the morning, when
McEnerney opened, until 5 p. m., when
Budd closed.
Attorney. McEnerney confined himself
largely to exposing the weaknesses, fal
4acies and contradictions in the testimony
offered by Mrs. Craven-Fair's witnesses.
He said the court could decide the case
in favor of the Fair heirs on these points
alone.
The' attorney analyzed the testimony of
each of the petitioner's witnesses and
talked of the absence of direct proof ot
the marriage of -Fair and Mrs. Craven.
It was not likely, he said, that Fair
would treat his wife as a stranger.
The witnesses who said they had heard
Fair call Mrs. Craven his wife were un
certain and evasive, the attorney con
tinued.
"Mrs. Craven's case is built upon fraud
and corruption," Mr. McEnerney said.
"There is no eecape from the conclusion
that she stands guilty of perjury, bribery
and forgery."
"This lady incubates witnesses wherev
er she settles," said Budd, after dwelling
on the stories told by Slmpton and Sylva
of Sausalito and Lane of Alameda. Con
tinuing, the attorney went into the laws
of marriage, as they existed in California
in 1892, when Fair is alleged to have mar
ried Mrs. Craven by contract.
It was the duty of the court to distrust
the evidence of Mrs. Craven as to the al
leged marriage contract, said Mr. Budd,
because of her efforts to establish the
forged deeds. The testimony of any in
terested party as to the acts of a deceas
ed person must always be looked upon
with suspicion, he said, and quoted Eng
lish and American decisions setting forth
this theory. . . . \ ; .
Whether or not there was a forgery.
Budd claimed, Mrs. Craven was not en
titled to a family allowance because she
was not an immediate member of the
Fair family, fche and Fair had always
lived apart. She herself had testified that
the marriage of herself and Fair was a
secret that should die with them. He
never even took her to the theater, and
did not go on the street with her, save
the one time when It was alleged he and
she appeared before Craig to acknowl
edge the marriage contract.
â¢ Under the laws of California, the at
torney said," there never was a solemniza
tion of the marriage. It was impossible
for it to be solemnized save under the
provisions of the code. If they had de
ported themselves as man and wife they
would have received the benefit of the
assumption.
* If there was any legal solemnization,
said Budd, It took place before Slmpton
in July, 1892. It was strange Mrs. Craven
had never mentioned this to any one.
Why, he asked, if Simpton had performed
thia ceremony, had her astute attorneys
sued on the deeds, when,- by establishing
Mrs. Craven's marriage with Fair, they
could have obtained for her one-third of
$9,000,000? Strange she did not remem
ber the : Slmpton ceremony before the
deeds, were declared- forgeries.
. Why had she never told her brother-in
law, McArthur,' who Is an attorney? Budd
asked/ Why had not Craig Indorsed the
alleged marriage contract on the back if
his conscience prevented him entering it
In bis book?
As to Simpton and Sylva, no matter how
Â¦ bad 'they- were-, they were of Mrs. Cra
ven's finding, said the attorney. N'o mat
ter how great or little they could be re
lied upon, they were her witnesses.
The argument goes on to-day. I-Jife
Pence will occupy the forenoon for Mrs.
Craven and W. S. Pierson will close for
the heirs. Â¦ -

New Plan for Election of Teachers
in the Department â Money Ee
quested to Equip Chil
dren's Playground.
The Board of Education at Its meeting
yesterday morning decided not to remove
Madame Glffard, special teacher of
French, from her position In the depart
ment. Superintendent Webster Introduc
ed a resolution providing for the dismissal
of the - teacher on the ground that the
certificate under which she had been ap
pointed was Illegal because It had been
renewed before its expiration.
Director Denman contended that Mad
ame Giffard's certificate was a rogrant
and not a renewal. Though he admitted
that it was not renewed within the legal
period, he stated that she had been grant
ed another certificate on her credentials
as a graduate of_a French academy and
also upon her original certificate. The
superintendent argued that the certificate
was really a renewal, and as It had not
been renewed in time it was clearly il
legal. AVhen the vote was taken on Web
ster's resolution Chairman Mark and Di
rectors â¢ Casserly and Denman voted
against It. Mrs. KIncald, who agreed
with Webster's contention; voted in fa
vor of the resolution.
Miss E. J. McGrcevy, a teacher of the
South End School, who had been reported
for frequent absence from her duties, did
not fare so well as her associate. She
was suspended from the School Depart
ment for one year from April 25, 1900.
The resolutions recited that Miss Mc-
Greevy had failed repeatedly for years to
notify the principal of her intended ab
sence, thus directly violating the rules
of the board, and that the Interests of the
department suffered toy the irregular at
tendance of the teacher. Miss K. Tarpey
was assigned to the vacancy. Miss M. L.
Boylan was assigned to the Burnett
School.
The following resolution was . also
adopted:
Â¦Whereas, It is our desire to secure assist
ance in formulating the best possible plan for
the election of teachers to our department: and
we believe that experts In the profession of
pedagogy and men of large experience in the

WARRANTS ISSUE
FOR ARREST OF
TELEPHONE MEN
Tax Collector Scott Forces an Issue
Upon, the Question of License
Tax on the Talking De-
Corporation Officials Must
Answer for Alleged Re
fusal to Pay.
Â¦Warrants were issued last night by Po
lice Judge Fritz upon complaint of Tax
Collector Scott, for the arrest of John I.
Sabln, president and general manager of
the telephone company, and for Frank
Katon, secretary of The corporation, for
alleged violation of the telephone license
ordinances.
The complaints are based upon three
counts. They cover all of the legal phases
of the contest which has been inaugurated
by Tax Collector Scott to enforce the law
requiring tho telephone corporation to pay
specific license tax on each instrument in
service. The Tax Collector's demand upon
the company for payment was refused.
Scott then applied to the District Attorney
and the complaints were accordingly pre-
The first count carries the charge that
the company has refused to pay the
license of $2 a quarter on each telephone,
which tax was Imposed nearly two years
ago The second count applies to a 60
cent license tax levied upon each tele
phone which has a nlckel-ln-the-slot at
tachment. The third item of complaint
is upon the alleged refusal of the com
pany to file with tho Tax Collector a veri
fied statement of the number of telephones
in service within the city's Jurisdiction.
Each of these charges under the or
dinances Is a misdemeanor. The com
plaints are framed in such a manner as
to enable the courts to make the legal
test which la sought by the Tax Col
lector. The entire subject of telephone
licensing will be fought out. Â¦
Tax Collector Scott said: "In order to
have every point fully covered I have
had both of the license ordinances
brought into this fight. If the corporation
is liable for this, tax we want to know
It as soon as possible. I feel confident
my position is the correct one and that
the company will be compelled to pay up."

10S4 Bush street, yesterday morn
ing. Death came to Mr. Strother at the
age Qf 61 and waa the result of a lingering
Illnes3 which developed Into pneumonia.
The end came suddenly and painlessly
while Mr. Strother was asleep, although
he suffered considerably during the past

physicians informed her that there was
no hope for her husband's recovery.

quite young and studied law. Later he
married and was admitted to the bar. In

times he was elected a Supervisor and re

expiration of his last term as a city
father he accepted the nomination for Au
ditor. He was elected to this office three
times also.
About eight years ago Mr. Strother re
tired from politics and has since practiced
law.- His health had recently been failing

Mr. Truman thought that advisory
boards should be appointed to promote
district organization of Republican clubs.
Mr. McGowan regretted that the Repub
licans of San Francisco had long been
denied the opportunity to fight for the
party's cause on lines of principle. It
was unfortunate that the party organiza
tion In municipal affairs waa managed by
men who recognized vice and gain as the
chief ends of domination. It was time
that Republican campaigns should be
placed on a higher plane.
Attorney General Ford appreciated thÂ©
sentiments expressed by Senator Mc-
Gowan and pointed out the danger of los
ing campaigns through apathy and defec
tive organization.
Davis IxfUderback spoke of the great Im
portance of the Presidential campaign.
The question Involved is whether Ameri

The Democratic County Committee, Jas
per McDonald chairman, will meet in Na
tive Sons' Hall next Tuesday evening
Preliminary steps will then be taken to
devise some plan of creating a municipal
convention to choose delegates to the
Democratic State Convention. The State
Central Committee of the party decided
against the plan of permitting county
committees to appoint delegates. Follow
ers of Phelan in San Francisco are stren
uously opposing the primary election
method, hence a convention will be creat
ed by the county committee. -
Outside of ' the old commjttee which
managed the last municipal campaign the
Mayor has not many supporters. IIÂ© has
adherents, however, in the committee and
they may be able to create a convention
that will elect delegates favorable to his
cause.
It peemi to be settled, as The Call pre
dicted some days agro, that ex-Senator

THE Musicians' Mutual Protective
Union objects to policemen as musi
cians. They could stand for Lees'
drum corps, but the sight of twenty
"cops" with trombones, cornets and bass
horns in their fists Instead of clubs, was
the straw that broke the camel's back.
Incidentally, they believe that numerous
crimes which have been committed
throughout the city might have been pre
vented had policemen been devoting their
time to patrolling their beats. That a score
of husky blue coats are permitted to leave
their beats two days of each week for two
hours at a time that they may "Jam"
wind and furnish the even step for the an
nual parade has aroused their unbounded
indignation.
At a meeting of the board of directors of
the Musicians' Mutual Protective Union
on Tuesday it was decided to bring the
matter before the members of the union
at the next regular monthly meeting, and
the delegates to the Labor Council were
instructed to' lay the matter before that
body. The musicians think that the or
ganization of a police band to furnish
music for parades is an injustice to them,
as the officers composing that body are re
ceiving fat salaries for patrolling their
beats and should not taka the bread and
butter out of the mouths of those whosÂ«
sole business It Is to do the music act
when public occasions demand it. An
other thing that la significant in the- eyes
of the Musicians' Union is the fact that
twenty beats remain unwatched for a
period of four hours each week, while thÂ©
eves that should keep vigil over them arÂ»
nxed on sheet music in a little room on
Larkin street to no particular advantage
to the public.
One thing is certain, however, that
whatever thÂ© result of thÂ© union's action
may be, there will be no boycott levied on
the police force.

TOUCHING SCENE IN
A CITY POLICE COURT
A REPENTANT husband, a weeping and forgiving wife and a pretty little
girl, blue eyed and flaxen haired, and a sympathetic Judge were actors
in a touching drama conducted in Judge Fritz's court yesterday. The
husband was Peter Hansen, a teamster, who was under arrest for being
tfrnnk. When he was arraigned in court Mrs. Hansen was there to plead for
him. and his little daughter tearfully seconded her plea. Hansen was completely
overcome). He asked the Judge to pledge him not to drink intoxicating liquors
again and in the same breath expressed confidence that he would be able to keep
the pledge. The Judge swore Hansen ar.d then he signed the pledge of total ab
stinence which the court clerk had drafted.
TnÂ« patient wife, who had forgiven he-r husband already for the trouble he
hai brought upon her, said that she was now satisfied, and her face shone with
r.ew happiness as the case was dismissed and her husband was permitted to leave
the court with her a free man. They went from the room arm-in-arm and as
they Â¦walked away the little girl put her tiny hand in that of her father and
coaxed him not to cry any more.

BIG INCREASE IN
DEFICIT OF CITY
Supervisors' Fruitless Economy
Only Reduces It a Paltry
Amount.
Auditor Wells Declares It Will Reach Enormous
Sura of $203,776.85 if St. Marys
Park Is Purchased.
AUDITOR WEL.LS threw a bombshell into the camp of the Board of Super
visors yesterday when he made the startling statement that If $125,000 la
set apart for the purchase of St. Marys Park there will be a total estimated
deficit of $203,776 85 in the municipal funds at the end of the present fiscal
year. The statement is all the more remarkable from the fact that the present
Board of Supervisors began Its official career In a determined attempt to wipe
out a prospective deficit of $211,000 and after three months' effort, during which
time the etreets have been plunged into darkness and the taxpayers subjected
to all kinds of annoyance and inconvenience, the deficit has been reduced by 'a
paltry $7000. according to the Auditor's figures.
The cash on hand to the credit of the general fund Is placed at $501,463 S7. In
this item Auditor Wells includes the fund of $125,000 which heretofore was sup
. posed to have been set apart for the purchase of St. Marys Park. As a matter
of fact. Wells contends that the money has never been set aside for the purpose
but is part and parcel of the general fund. He figures out a deficiency of $78,
776 Â£5 in the city funds if the $125,000 Is not used for the park purchase. If It should
be held to be a separate fund, which Wells claims is Impossible, the deficit
of $78,776 85 will be increased by $125,000. Under this system of figuring it is
estimated that the total deficit will be $203,776 85, or exactly $7233 15 less than
when the present administration started out to reduce expenses on all sides
with so little show of success. . .
The Auditor's statement to the Board of Supervisors shows the condition of
the general fund and an estimate of the probable expenditures and" revenue of
the different departments for May and June of the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1900:
Demands on hand with Auditor and Supervisors $30,000 00
Estimated probable expenditures 629,082 48
. $719,682 4S
Cash on hand City and County Treasury, May 14, 1000 â
General fund $501.463 87
TaxÂ»>s 1SJS-1S99 to be transferred to current year 6,649 62
Redemptions of property eoM to State 6,800 00
Railroad Taxes Â¦ 392 2-t

Probable deficit for fiscal year 1S33-19OO "S.776 85
If St. Mary* Park is purchased 125,000 00
$203,776 85
Owing to the probable deficit the most stringent economy Is absolutely nec
essary In all departments. The Auditor suggests that the heads of the various
branches of the municipal government meet In conference at an early date In
order to devise ways and means to overcome the shortage.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MAY 18, 1900.

The spasm of excitement that swept the
city when Judge Cook announced that ]
he" had seen Mrs. Cordelia Botkin on a I
Guerrero-street car has subsided and, eo ,
far as the court is concerned, the Incident j
is closed. A complete cycle has been made, j
by the h.vestisators of the matter and
they are now where they started. So is
the public.
The !2f=t net in the comedy that followed
Judge Cook'p alleged discovery of the fair
poisoner on the car and far from jail was
enacted in his court chambers yesterday
at noon. At that hour Mrs. Botkln's
counsel. Attorneys Knight, Heggerty &
Madden: Sheriff Lackmaiin. Under Sheriff
Hare and a Fmall audience of curiosity
ceekers assembled in the chambers.
Judge Cook, smilingly addressing Mrs.
Botkin' s attorneys, said that he requested
their presence that he might ask them as
to their knowledge of her whereabouts on
April tZ last. Counsel responded that they
did not know where she was that day,
but Mr. Heggerty added that he saw her
In company with Deputy faheriff Kincaid
on the day "the went to the dentist's. Mrs.
Botkin wanted to talk to him. he said,
but a* the Deputy Sheriff was anxious to
return to the jail he was unable to grant
her an audience. Â¦ -,
Turning to Sheriff I>ackmann. Judge
Cook, with a. mild display of asperity.
Eald: "I .^e by the reports of this case
that you say I informed you that the man
who was with Mrs. Botkin on the car
was smooth shaven."
"Yes. I understood you to so state, an
swered Lackmann.
"I told you nothing- of the kind. re
sponded Judgf Cook. ' "I said that he
had a mustache like that which adorns
the face of the stenographer of my court.
Mr. Stephens."
"But. notwithstanding 1 this discrepancy
la my statement, if such it was." said
Lackmann. '"are you now satisfied that
none of the heads of my department are
responsible for the granting of any favors
to Mrs. Botkin r*
"I accuse no "one." answered the court:
"but still to my mind Mrs. Botkin was on
the car as I stated. I know her gesture
and her step, and a look of recognition
passed between us when she entered the
car. She looked as though she was won
dering whether or not I would bother her.
Her dress exhibited to me at the Jail was
not that she wore on the day I saw her,
but she could have easily borrowed the
onÂ© she did wear. However, as there is
but my word that she was out of jail the
matter must end ; but I hope the Sheriff
will take heed of the friendly information
which I gave him and see to it that if
Mrs. Botkin was out of iall on that day,
as I firmly believe that she was,' the inci
dent will not be repeated."
Court, lawyers. Sheriffs and audience
then adjourned.
