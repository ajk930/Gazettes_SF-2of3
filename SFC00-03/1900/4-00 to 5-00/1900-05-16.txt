THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL.DELEGATES AT LARGE
TO THE NATIONAL REPUB
LICAN CONVENTION AT
PHILADELPHIA.
especially do 'we, the people of California, for
the issues are the most vital to this great State.
California should indorse, and indorse over
whelmingly, the administration of William Mc-
Kinley. an administration which has revolution
ized commercially Â» these "Pacific States. It 1Â«
one of the- ,mcst essential things for success
that, we have In the ranks of our party har
mony. We reed the urgent, we need the most
earnest, support of every Republican; we need
the earnest eupnort of every faction. Â¦ /
As a Caltfornlan, as one who has the Inter
ests Of this great State, at heart,. I wish 1 to
place in 'nomination for the honored position
of delegate-at-larre to the- national conven
tion, the name of, a. Californian. one who has
implicit faith in the future of this' great State,
a man who has that great faith in the future
of California that causes him. to put his wealth
'into the development of this great State.
Â¦We need in ; California more men like John
r>. Spreckels (applause and cheers) â men who
have Implicit faith In the future of their State
and men who are willing to show their faith
by investing their money and developing this
great commonwealth. . - ,: Â¦..
The Republicanism of Mr. Spreckels cannot
be questioned. When the Republican party has
been in need of assistance, when the Repub
lican party has been in need of financial aid,
then the Republicanism of John D. Spreckels
was not questioned. When the Republicans of
this great State desired aid In carrying to a
successful issue the different campaigns
through which we have passed, those in con
trol of the affairs of the party have n6t hesi
tated to receive f rom Mr. Spreckels his finan
cial aid. . Â«.;Â¦Â¦-;.-;-.Â¦,;.
I would not detract one lota from what has
been said relative to the merits of the various
candidates who have been presented , to this
convention, but I will eay that Mr. Spreckels
is pqnal in loyalty to the party. In loyalty to
the State. . to any who have been mentioned.
And for the sake of harmony, and because I
believe It is the smallest honor we can bestow
upon a man who has done so much for this
great State, and because I believe he Is fit,
that he Is an able representative, and that he
will carry to Philadelphia the message of Cali
fornia and as well will represent this common
wealth as any of tljose who have already been
mentionedâ for these reasons I present to this
convention the name of Hon. John D. Spreck
els of San Francisco. (Applause.)
Preston Talks Plainly.
E. F. Preston of San Francisco second
ed the nomination of Mr. Spreckels. Mr.
Preston spoke as follows: â¢
Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of the Re
publican Convention; Four years ago the
National Convention of Republicans met'in
this city for deliberation. Since that time
it has blazoned the broad rOad of.hlsrory
and planted its honors in letters of ever
glowing light upon the temples of fame.
It carried the American flag up the blood
swept hill at ElCaney; it swept the Span
ish fleet at Manila. It has carried us
through one of the most dangerous and
one of the most critical periods in Ameri
can history.
It is -easy to stand bofore a Republican
convention and dispose of questions
which tear the â¢ Senate of -the
United States asunder; it is easy
to dispose of great momentous
questions, and .because a man does not
agree with you cast the taint of disloyalty
upon him. It is easy to â¢ talk, but it is
hard to act. The' Republican party acts;
the Democratic party criticizes.
__What , is the condition here to-day?
There is no Republican who does not love
William McKinley; and his reputation.
(Applause and cheers.) There Is no Re
publican who is not proud of the adminis
tration which for the first time blotted
out Mason and Dixon's line and let a
united American army under the Blue and
Gray climb that hill to glory and dlo like
Americans. (Applause.) And who are
these men who arise and criticize and
carp and cavil? I have heard to-day upon
the floor of this convention remarks upon
the loyalty, upon the Republicanism of
the gentleman whose name I rise to sec
ond. I am his personal friend, and I am
proud of it. And. I am a Republican and
ne is a Republican, and the man who has
circulated these stories about his loyalty
I defv to repeat them to his face.
â¢*I like a highwayman who comes to my
face and takes some element of personal
danger when he meets me in my front. I
can even, respect, a- burly ruffian" who
meets me face to face and brains me with
his cudgel if it takes nerve to strengthen
his-'arm; but 1 despise the shivering, cow
ardly assassin I who sneaks up with noise
less foot behind and places his poniard in
your weisand without any element of risk
to himself. Â¦
I vouch for the Republicanism of John
D. Spreckels.: (Applause. ) I vouch for his
loyalty to the administration. : . I vouch for
his support of that Republican platform,
whether - it " agrees with Â¦ Mr. McKinley
that * free trade should bo awarded ' to
Porto Rico, or If it decides with the United
States Senate that the .United States tar

made during the session of the Seventh
Congressional District this afternoon to
pledge the delegates to Indorse George
Pardee, George A. Knight, N. D. RIdeout
and U. S. Grant Jr. as delegates at large
to the National Convention, but It failed.
The southern delegates showed a disin
clination to bind themselves by accepting
the candidates named as their choice.
The motion made by George Frost to ac
cept the four gentlemen waa laid on thÂ»
table and the programmers made a vain
effort to resurrect it. but scored a failure.

more energetic in their sense of civic duty than
the yetriots of 1S96.
Tha Republican party advocates protection to
American Industry; It believes in reaching out
and getting for her citizens a fair share of that
vast trade that is prowins Â«I> in the awaken
ing Orient. The RcDUblJcan party believes in
a navv commene-jrete with the power and the
dignity of this great nation.' (Applausp.) ft
believes in extending the liberty-loving ideals
and the Inspiring tradition* of a free people to
the Island? of tbe Pacific; for patriotic devo
tion to the welfare of the republic It has never
been excelled. It represents all that is best in
orgenized society and wisest in American citi
zenship. (Applause.)
This party will meet next month at Philadel
phia In a national delegate convention. Ths du
ties devolving upon these delegates will" be
largo. The Issues of that convention will be
vast and effective. Will the American people
measure ur> to the full greatness of their op
portunities, or tvill they listen to the echo of
the past and become a stumbling block -In the
onward march of free Institutions? Will we be
true to her liberty-loving ideals, or will we
prove apostate to the spirit of liberty? Will
we, my friends, debase our coinage, or stand
loyally by the business honesty and Integrity of
the v/oria? 'Will we convert the Pacific Ocean
into a great commercial highway for American
enterprises, or will the Anrlo-Saxon race find
in its first decadence? Will we cowardly
shrink from the duties of manifest destiny and
cower Â«t the cry of Imperialism, or will we
baptize ourselves anew in the spirit of our
fathers and fearlessly discharge the duties of a
nation of freemen? (Applause.).'
My friends, the Philadelphia convention must
answer these questions, and it must answer
them right; and to that end we must send as
delegates to that convention men Inspired by
patriotism and upheld by the idols of the repub
licâmm of business; men of Judgment: men of
Straining in the duties of citizenship. We must
Â¦send to that convention men whose election will
not honor, but whose presence In the convention
will be an honor to the Republican party. (Ap :
plause.)
Gentlemen of ths convention, .we bring to
you from . Southern California such a manr-a"
man high In character, trained in the law, en
ergetic in his eenge of civic duty, and a man
with a heart as warm as the genial climate in
which he lives. (Applause.) A man interested
in the growth and prosperity of Southern Cali
fornia and more patriotically devoted to the
whole Interests of the Imperial commonwealth;
a man whose character is as high and whose
mind is as clear as the unclouded sky of our
sunny southland, and. lastly, a man who is
patriotically, unfalteringly devoted . to the -re
nomlnatlcn of William' McKinley for President
of the United States. (Continued applause.)*
Gentlemen, I have the distinguished pleasure
of nominating for one of the delegates at large
from the State of California to the National
Henubllcan Convention the Hon. U. S. Grant
Jr.' of 8an Die;o.
U. S. Grant's nomination was seconded
by Judge McKinley of Los Angeles, E. V.
Spencer of Lassen. Senator Gillette and
C. R. Stewart of San Diego..
Knight's Name Presented.
George A. Knight was placed in the
field by Judge McKinley of Los Angeles,
Â¦who addressed the convention as follows:
Gentlemen of the Convention: The Republi
can party always goes forward and never back
ward^ It Is always foremost In all the great
movements of foreign and domestic policy in
this country. As Garfleld once expressed it:
"Where are the embers of our camp fires, fre
quently the Democratic party has followed."
I bring you to-night the name of a man who
needs no eulogy from me. b?cau?e hin own
eloquence throughout the length^, and breadth
of this' State has made him a home. in the
hearts of Its people. In 18S4, when the State
of California, looked forward .enthusiastically
to the nomination of that brilliant, and peer
less leader, James G. Blaine (applause), it
eent to that convention among- its delegates a
young man whose' name I am to present to
you to-night. On other occasions, the last at
St. I>ouis four years ago, when the delegates to
the Republican Â¦ party gathered to nominate a
candidate for -Preeldentâ the. same man was
among the number and took part in the nom
ination of the great etatesman whose admin
istration of the affairs of this i, Government / is
such that the Republican party goes into this
contest with the confidence that victory must
result.
I present to you the name of a man whom,
as I have said, we all love and admire. I bring
to you the name of George A. Knight. (Ap
plause.)
Mr. Knight's nomination was seconded
by C. W. Kyle of San Francisco.
Pardee Named by Young.
Dr. George C. Pardee's name was pre
sented to the convention by J.N. Young
of Alameda, who said: .
Mr. President and gentlemen of the conven
tion: It becomee my pleasant duty, to bring be
fore you a representative of the banner Repub
lican county of the State of California. (Ap
plause.) He is well known to every Republican
throughout the State. He was born in the State
of California, and his Interests areÂ» involved in
the welfare of his native State. ' His 'name is
Dr. George C. Pardce. (Applause.), He is the
uninlmous choice of every man in 'Alaincda

1 believe to-day he is the choice of. every man
who has. at h*art the best Interests of Califor

of nee more creditably than ' will Dr. Pardee.

CALL. HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, May 15.â Ex-Judge "Walling of
Nevada County was elected temporajj''
chairman of the Second Congressional
District Convention at the initial session
of that body this forenoon. The meet
ing was called. to order by Attorney Ar
thur Levlnsky of Stockton, who Is chair
man of the district committee. At the
outset Mr. Levinsky stated that he had
been informed by delegates from Inyo,
Mono, Tuolumne, Amador and San Joa
quin counties that they had delegates
en route to- the convention, and advised
that a recess be taken until 4 o'clock or
until after. the convention had adjourned.
H. E. Barber of San Joaquln took the
cue and secured the floÂ«r. He said j that
his "county was entitled to fifteen dele
gates; that they were not all present,
but had agreed, to attend the delib
erations of: the convention. He therefore
moved that a recess be taken until '4
o'clock.
Grove L. Johnson, always on the alert
to make a parliamentary point, started
to say that ho did not agree with Bar
ber, and stated his reasons for his view
of tjie situation, but was sharply called
down by the chairman, who invited him
to wait until the motion wAs properly
put. Johnson gracefully subsided for the
nonce, but was soon on his feet in oppo
sition to the motion. He contended that
it was the duty of the district convention
to . effect temporary' . organization and
elect a chairman and secretaries. Further
debate followed, but the motion was lost.
Again Grove L. secured the floor, and
placed J. M. /Walling of Nevada in nomi
nation for chairman. His election was
made by acclamation. Judge "Walling was
formally Introduced to the convention by
Mr. Levinsky as "the old Republican war
horse" of Nevada County. Chairman
Walling took good-natured . exception to
the statement that he was old, and felt
sure that no one who saw him would ac
cept such a statement. ;
" H. E. Barber of San Joaquln and Frank
Smith were named as temporary secre
taries. Their election was by acclamation.
After Assemblyman Johnson and Senator
Cutter of Yuba failed to prolong the in
itial session Levfnsky's motion to adjourn
until the afternoon prevailed.
Upon reconvening In the afternoon. the
Second Congressional District Convention
took up the work prescribed for it. Judge
Walling was made permanent chairman
and Secretaries Barber and Smith perma
nent * secretaries. Nominations "for dele
gates | to j the i convention being . in order.
Grove L. Johnson bobbed up serenely and
named E..C. Hart of Sacramento. | Arthur
Levinsky was placed in nomination. Tut

vices rendered the party by Harold Power
of Placer and told of his fitness for Hhe
office.* Â¦: Judge Niles " \ ." '; : followed and
placed John F. Kidder of Grass Valley in
nomination. A ballot resulted in. the elec

disappointment Levinsky and Kidder were
offered the ' posts of alternates, but both
gracefully refused. Thoma3 Voorhles ; of
Amador and J. W. Wilson of Sacramento
were then elected alternates.

E. C. HART, Chairman.
Innovation Goes Through.
T. V. Eddy of Ban Francisco moved the
adoption of thÂ» report. E. F. Preston
called attention to an innovation In the
report. He objected to that section which
provides for the appointment of a State
executive committed by the chairman of
the convention. He moved that it be
stricken out and that there be substituted
for It a clause providing that the State
Central Committee shall elect its own ex
ecutive committee. Dibble replied that
the clause was not -an innovation, but waa
copied from the report of two years ago.
Preston replied that -it might have been
slipped in at the last convention, but li
â¢was: not in keeping with' the customs of
the good old times when the State Central
Committee of this State elected its own
executive committee. ' .
A motion to amend the report was de
feated. A motion to adopt prevailed.
In presenting the report of the commit
tee on platform and resolutions Judge
McKinley of Los Angeles said that the
committee took" Into consideration that
another convention would be held for the
purpose of nominating electors, hence an
elaborate declaration of principles was
not embodied In the report.". The report
was adopted in a perfunctory fashion.
Hub1>ell Nominates Grant.
The chair announced that -the next or
der of business was the flection of four
delegates at large:- O. C.'Hubbell of Santa
Barbara, to the and
placed In nomination U." S. Grant Jr. Mr.
Hubbell spoke as follows:
Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Conven
tion: The Republican Â¦ party stands to-day as
the conservator of the peace of the world. Had
It listened to the etuoid demands of Democ
racy it would have withdrawn the American
flas " from 'the Philippine Archipelago and
painted the' horizon's rim red with the flames
of a world-wide war over Its possession. The
Republican party believes in honest money.' it
has placed upon the statute books of the na
tion a standard of . value recognized by the
world as the safest and best. In 1S96. with a
patriotism and a devotion never excelled it
opposed the current of financial Idiocy and
saved this country; from the perils of a free

tacked by the Chicago platform. Republicans

the farms and the meadows blending in unison
with the wisdom end oratory of its leaders.
(Applaud and cheers.) And when we lock
along the pathway, gentlemen, and we see that
this party ever sine* its birth has stood an

CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO. May 15.â A. Ruef of San Fran
cisco kicked over the traces and created
ft mild sensation among the delegates of
the â¢ Fourtn Congressional Convention
during its session this afternoon. The
clever young attorney refused to be tied
down by Bosses Kelly and Crimmins,
v.-ho occupied seats in the rear of the
meeting and coached their satellites how
to vote.
Joseph S. Spear opened the meeting of
the Fourth District, and after Secretary
Prendegast had finished calling the roll
of members he called for nominations for
temporary chairman. Delegate D. D.
Sullivan named Colonel T. V. Eddy for
the office, and that . gentleman was se
lected by acclamation. P. H. Prende
gast was made temporary -secretary. On
motion of Attorney Ruef .the temporary
officers were made permanent.
Nominations for delegates to the na
tional convention being in order, Charles
Sonntag nominated Moses A. Gunst.* He
said that his candidate waa well known
as a representative business man, had
done good work for the party, and should.
therefore* be rewarded. At the conclu
sion of Mr. Sonntag's eulogy Surveyor of
the Port spear clapped his hands bois
terously. Mr. Ruef followed by placing
Mr. Spear in nomination. He alluded to
the latter as the original McKinley man.
Nominations being closed, both candi
dates were elected delegates by accla
mation. Hanry Sonntag and A. Ruef
were elected alternates without a dis
senting vote.
Chairman Eddy stated that he under
stood that a precedent had been estab
lished by thA, Fifth Congressional District
to nominate or express a choice as to
who shall be delegates at large at the
national convention to be held next
month at Philadelphia. There was a long
pause and Ruef took the Initiative. He
arose and moved that the Fourth Dis
trict indorse John D. Spreckels. Charles
Rode seconded the nomination. E. J.
Smith moved that George Pardee. N. D.
RIdeout, U. S. Grant and George A.
Knight be indorsed as delegates at large.
Delegate Ruef secured the floor and In
ringing tones said:
Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of this con
vention: I have not one word to say against
any of the four gentlemen whoee names have
been proposed here, but I have an abiding con
viction that in the interests of Republican suc
cess in San Francisco and for the benefit of
our party, we should nominate the gentleman
whose name 1 proposed. I hear It stated that
he was not a candidate. If that Is so. of
course my motion would be withdrawn, but if
he is, I think he Is entitled to an Indorsement
at the hands of this convention. We need the
support of prominent Republicans In San Fran
cisco, and we ought not to allow an entering
wedge to be made now to weaken our party
In the next campaign. I think we ought to
have the indorsement of Mr. Spreckels by
unanimous vote.
Mr. Ruef's eloquence had little effect on
the members of his delegation, who
showed clearly that they were dominated
by the wills of Kelly and Crimmlns. The
motion made by Smith to Indorse the four
gentlemen first named was adopted. An
adjournment was taken~ to the call of
the chair.

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. May 15.â Judge Dibble could not
restrain his anxiety to be seen and heard
at the session of the Fifth Congressional
convention. Before Max Goldberg, the
chairman of the body, could make himself
heard above the noise of shuffling feet and
animated conversation Judge Dibble was
on his feet with a proposition to elect
O. A. Hale of San Jose chairman. Gold
berg was taken back at this - usurpation
of his power and he chided the Judge for
his impetuosity. . After William James of
San Jose had called the roll Dibble again
sought the floor with better -results. He
placed Mr. Hole in nomination and. as
expected, that gentleman was elected by
acclamation. . o .
In taking the office Mr. Hale thanked
the members for the honor conferred upon
him. He took 'occasion to congratulate
the late convention on the fact that the
men, named as delegates to the na
tional convention would have a vofce in
naming the next President and Vlc*Presl
dent of the United States. . /
Mr. James showed a willingness to re
linquish his arduous duties as temporary
secretary, by nominating I. J. As c helm of
San Francisco for that offlci/ The latter
was elected by acclamation.'
The next order of business being the
election of two delegates* and two alter
nates to the National Convention Frank
Haynes nominated H..G. Bond of Santa
Clara and W. Woods nominated W. C.
Van Fleet of San Francisco as delegates,
and their selection. was made by acclama
tion. James Alva-Watt nominated George
M. Bowman of Pan Jose and George Stone
nominated E. D/ Pelxotto of San Francis
co as alternates and both were elected by
acclamation./
The?next order of business was the en
dorsement ,of four delegates ' at large to
the convention. Again Watt took the floor
and inÂ» matter-of-fact, programme way
nomlnated Dr. .Pardee; George A. Knight
,U:' S. Grant Jr. and N. â¢: D. RIdeout. The
motion was placed before. the convention
H. W. Brown of San Mateo gained the at
tention | of the convention long enough to
say.that he would not bind himself to the
action of .that body, and, therefore, would
withdraw \ from .the convention. A vote
was : then ' taken and the four named re
ceived an ipdorsement. <

tion organized by the election of Warren
Porter of Santa Cruz chairman and Lu
ther G. Brown of Los Angeles secretary.
It was noted that Mr. Porter presided
with rare grace and great dignity. Wal

nation of district delegates. The motion
prevailed. William M. Garland of Los
Angeles and A. J. Bell of Ventura were
chosen delegates to the national conven
tion by acclamation. Dr. E. Henderson
of Pomona and Warren M. John of San
Luis Obispo were elected as alternates.
Judge Dibble averted an adjournment
by reminding Mr. Watt that he had a
resolution in his jeans which was apropos
of the time. He relieved Mr. Watt of the
document and introduced it. Judge Dib
ble read the resolution and commented
upon it, but whatever he said was lost on
the delegates because of the inopportune
entrance of a brass band. The document
was passed in a jiffy, and Attorney
George C- Ross, who was patiently wait
ing to be heard on the subject, had to
make his speech after it war, adopted.
*The resolution was to the following ef
fect:
Whereas. The Republican District Convention
before the Fifth Congressional District for th<Â»
year 1S98 adopted a resolution authorizing, em
powering and directing James Alva- Watt,
chairman of said convention, to appoint a Con
gressional district committee for the Â«aid Fifth

member frcm each of the Assembly districts
within said Fifth Congressional District; and
Whereas. Pursuant to the power and authority
in him vested by said resolution, the said
chairman appointed the following named per

Fifth Congressional District Committee, to wit.:
Thirty-fourth Assembly District. E. I. Robin

Whereaa. The said committee so appointed
met and organized by the election of the said
Max Goldbers as chairman and the said LouU
O'Neill as secretary; and
j Whereas, The said Republican Fifth Congres
sional District has *o constituted, appointed
and organized thte. the Republican Fifth Con
gressional Committee; now, therefore,
Kf solved. That the said Republican Fifth Con
presslonal District Ommlttee as so constituted,
appointed ana organized as aforesaid be anrl U
hereby continued In office aa the Republican
Fifth Congressional District Committee, until
such time as their successors In office shall be
duly selected or appointed. V,
Resolved. That the chairman and secretary
of this' convention be directed to file certified
copies of these resolutions with the Secretary
of State of the State of California, with the
Registrar of Voters of the city and county of
San Francisco and of the counties of San Mateo
and Santa Clara and with the secretary of tha
Republican State Central Committee.
Mr. Ross secured attention and unbos
omed himself of the following fiery
speech:
We. In San Mateo County, do not think wÂ»
have been treated fairly In this matter, because
Mr. "Watt appointed as the comtnitteeman from
San Mateo Alvinza Hayward, a very good man
â a nÂ«*n who has been a prominent Republican
an* who has done good service for thÂ« party â
but it in known that he baa not attends! a> sin
gle meeting held by this Congressional commit
tee; that he has given a proxy, to Mr. Watt, re
sJdlnr in San Francisco. We. therefore, say
that so far as San Mateo County Is esVncenied
we have not had a representative upot.'^_thÂ»
committee and we do not think It is fair to iÂ».
that San Francisco should control out local
politics In. San Mateo County, but, on the con
trary, we should have somebody upon that
committee who will attend the meetings, who
will represent our party and who will be n. truÂ«
representative of tha people there. It Is known
that Alvinza Hayward is a gentleman of large
business affairs, a gentleman who has matters
upon his hands which are engaging him all the
time, yet we all know that he cannot and will
not stay In San Francisco over night for the
purpose of attending the meeting of this Con
gressional committee. Then why should Mr.
Hayward, a man whom we know will not at
tend, be appointed as a ccrnmitteeman from our
county ?
We think we should have a representative
thereâ who that representative Is, I do not
knowâ but we do think from our county. We
should have some onÂ© there who would prop
erly represent us. When this matter came up
some time aea I had an interview with Mr.
"Watt and told him the feeling cf our people:
that we did not think we had any one to repre
sent us. Not that Mr. Hayward was not as
good a man as mtcht be found, or that Mr.
Hayward was not a representative Republican,
but because be was a man who would not be
able to attend to the business and therefore we
had no voice \r. the committee. It seems to ma
that, under these circumstances, cur wishes in
the matter ought to be consulted and that
somebody should be appointed who will truly
represent us. .;?â¢"Â¦
Mr. Ross' passionate appeal for other
representation felJ on empty ears. An ad

Francisco;' E." S. Babcoek, San Diego, and
(Warren Porter, Santa Cruz.
Men speak of the proposition of supporting
this administration. I ask you, as Republi
cans, what is going to l>p the action uf the
National Convention with reference to the Porto
Rio bill that has* lately passed -Congress?
(Applause.) You all know the tight that was
made on it In Congress; you know that our
great, broad President, a man who does not put
an obstinate will against the intelligence of a
Congress; a man - who is ever able and ever
willing to listen to the voice of his party, as
proclaimed In conventions and In the wisdom
of his Congre5!>, Senate and House of Repre
sentatives tospthcr â you know when the
Republican intelligence of this Congress
went to him and called attention to what
should " be done on that bill Â¦ how he
took his stand with them, and how the bill was
passed, and hqw.it will probably be the great
yes, the greatâ resistance post in this whole
campaign. Yet there is not one single daily
morning paper in the city and county of San
Francisco that is to-day standing for the Porto
Rico bill as It passed Congress except The Call.
(Applause and cheers.) ,
Those are the facts. Xow let us be fair. Let
us throw no Innuendoes. Let us give every man
a square deal and let that sentiment prevail,
the sentiment of fairness to all concerned;
and. with no other motive on- earth. I second
the nomination of John D. Spreckels. (Applause
and cheers.)
I would second the nomination of almost every
other man presented to this convention, as far
as ability, as far as Integrity, as far as loyalty
to the Republican party Is concerned. But you
do not act fairly; you do not treat the Intelli

candidates you elmply make It a text from

VOTE BY COUNTIES.
I met a delegats this ; afternoon
who pretended to state to me, or ho
did Etatc, as one of his reasons, that
the policy of the paper conducted by
Mr. Sprcckel3 was not in accord with
the Republican principles. Why?
GÂ«u!*men, candidly, hr,r.Â»*tly. what are the
*talT.-art Republicans of this State froin'g to
Mr to-morrow morning. \t John I}. Spreckels
Is beaten in this ccr.ventlcn? What are- thev
tro!r^ f ray! You know, Â»^ wen as 1 know
it I tell >'"Â«. that the stalwart Republicans
of this Stnt* .nr" going to 'quit beln? pro

tinK enough of it. ThÂ» antarftnlsm to Mr
Sprecfcel."â it exists in th!* convention, we all
knr.w thatâ comes frem what?
There is no man within the sound of my voice
who does not owe more to the Republican
j>arty thar. he- n-ill Â«-ver be able to ray; no one
tvho lives beneath the folds of our ilag but has
received more through the beneficence of laws
raised by Republicans tiian he will ever be able
to dciial/*. either in coin or throuzh pernonal
Bf-rvlo*. in the furtherance -f political destinies
of thÂ» party. So I say. then, put them all upon
an equality so far as their merits are con
ceriu-o 1 .
There ore, however. I submit to you, gentle
men, matters cf supreme importance in connec
tion with the selection of these delegates. It
cinrot Â»Â»e Uenlefl. It Is as plain to you ns It Is
UUae: FOU know it Just as well as I know it.
i ;ir. here fcr the express purpose of seconding
the tominatlon of John D. Erreckel?. (Ap
!>lnut\.) And I will tell you why. Xo one who
will lij named here to-night has contributed
mere totht Republican party In this State, than
ha>= hi: %i;t. for that matter, there are none of
thÂ»m wh*. heve any claims at all, so far as
sc-rvire In^half of the Republican party is
concornwl. . . .
Mr. Cha'rman and - gentlemen of the con
vention: The fact that the delegates from this
convention to Philadelphia ko instructed for
the national administration makes it a measure
of minor Importance who the individuals thall
b* whom we select. Much has been said with
reference to the various claims of the gentle
men whose names have been submitted. I
have nothing to say against any one of them.
They are nil representative Republicans of this
State, and the mere Jact that their names are
presented to this convention is to me a suffi
cient proof that they are worthy, even did I
know nct!i!nn about their history In connec
tion with political matters or the past few
years. . â¢
C. F. Lacey of Monterey made a ring-
Ing and fearless speech in advocating the
nomination of Mr." Spreckels. Mr. Lacey
said:
Lacey's Fearless Words.
I am goinj; to be as candid as I can as an
attorney (laughter)â not an attorney for John
I>. Sprrckeis â and ray to you, gentlemen, we
are gt:ing7 to meet the Democratic party; we
are going to meet the Populist party that comes
from a tent some place In South Dakota; we
are coins to meet another mixed up Populist
party that comes from some place in Cincin
nati. We are gclng to meet some socialistic
party from Clod only knows where, and we are
going to meet about every party that any solid,
stalwart party can meetâ and we are Jhe solid
stalwart p.er>ub!lcan party.
Now. thÂ»n. we have got no walkover. Don't
you fool yourselves that all we have got to eay
is "Hill McKlnley" and we carry the thing
through. (A voice: "We will, all the name'.")
You will want some good notices throughout the
Ftate; you will want some grand editorials.
This is M threat, becsuse I am not authorized.
on3 I tsuM not if I were; but If The Call does
not give you the best that brains can give to
you Â¦ you roar nnd kick. If they find fault with
yoÂ«i take your medicine the way I took It to
day, (laughter.) I am telling you: don't make
a mirtake. gentlemen. Now. I say to you this,
candidly and honestly: lay aside all prejudice
ana feellnc As the gentleman who preceded
me Eaid. let us come together. I am not here
bc-tglr.s or pleadinsr, but be candid with ycur
fclves and do that which Is for the best inter
ests of the party; and you cannot make any
rr.'ttaJce when you send John D. Soreckels to
Philadelphia. (Applause and cheers.) I thank
you.
I am not here to tfll you that John D. Spreck
els is the perscnificatlon cf all that Is greet,
good and holy. I try to tell the truth and keep
my word. I am an attorney. (Lauehter and
applause.)
I reco-mize that In law a man is responsible
for the acts of his agents'done within the scope
of their authority. 1 know that the people, net
only In California, but of the United States,
recognize as a commercial and business man
John D. Sorccke'.s. (Applause.)
Now, I am talking to the entire Republican
party of California, because your representa
tives are here from every county in this State.
There is no man under God's t-un who has no
friends. There is no man under God's herfvens
who has r.ot his enemies. Show me a man
who has no enÂ»m!es, and I will show you a
man who has not bone and sinew, with a
mind to think and a tongue to talk, but a
men who hes been brought up on milk and
water. John E>. Spreckels is a man of bone
and sinew. (Applause and cheers.) He is not
afraid to say vÂ»hat he think?. (Applause.)
Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of this con
vention: 1 will not attempt to reach any fur
ther than the worthy and eloquent gentlemen
who have preceded me, and I am. willing to
admit, for the second time to-day, that I am
knocked out (laughter) in this, that I cannot
pluck the tall feathers from the American
eagle in words of eloquence, neither have I
eloquent musole or any other kSnd of muscle
sufnclent to brighten the glery of the stars
and stripes of that Old Glory that they all
talk atout (laughter),- WÂ« have heard all
about America and new America. We have
heard plaudits of the great Republican party.
Now, Just for a very few moments, let us
get down to plain, every-day, ordinary, good
sense. (Applause and laughter).
A. L. Levinsky of San Joaquin seconded
the nomination of John D. Spreckels. He
Bald;
Levinsky Utters a Warning.
I Eay this because I feel, and feel deep
ly, that Mr. Spreckels has been made the
victim, of an unjust, of a covert, of a
hidden "assault; and all 1 want â and what
I think every man gets in a Republican
convention â Is fair play, common honesty.
And if a lifelong record of Integrity, if a
lifelong record of honesty, if a lifelong
record of devotion to the Republican par
ty and devotion to the great Industrial
industries of the State fits John D. Spreck
elsâIf It fits any man â to go to that con
vention,'then the destinies of California
will be safe in his hands and I second his
nomination. (Applause.)
I teil you, fellow Republicans, fair play
Is a jewel. Right is always might and
right is always triumphant. Men with ac
tive brains inay scheme and twist; men
may think that they have got an "air
tight" can which cannot be punctured,
but the great pressure of natural laws
punctures them all the time; and machine
politicians and machine politics have too
often been repudiated at the polls, that
you should not learn to listen.
affairs. I agree that It needs men with
trained minus. I agree that it requires
thought; that it requires service; that li
requires ability of an eminent degree. And
looK. at the record of John D. Spreckels
and tell me wherein he is lacking. What
is this question that has arisen upon the
floor of this convention about his hostil
ity to William McKinley? 1 assertâ and
the witnesses are on the floor of. the con
vention within sound of my voiceâ that he
Is the personal friend of William McKln
ley and that William McKinley will be
glad to see him come back and extend the
welcome hand to him. (Applause.)

LITTLE TIME LOST
IN THE CONVENTION
Speaking of his campaign for Congress
In 1SSS he attributes his defeat to Mr.
Daly, saying:
Treacherous work was done everywhere In
the several counties where Daly had men em
ployed and the result was my defeat by sev
eral thousand majority, and from this stag
gering blow of treachery the party did not
recover for many years. There was no provo
cation for this. There had been no business
difficulties and never an unkind work had been
spoken between us. It was simply an en
vious and diabolical desire on his part to for
ever destroy my political influence In the ter
ritory-
He then reiterated that he went Into the
contest of 1S98 merely for the purpose of
breaking down Daly rule in Montana and
not for the purpose of promoting his own
political interests. He said that this un-
Daly's Alleged Treachery.
I contend that an investigation Involving a
seat In the highest legislative body of this
nation, as well as the honor of an individual
chosen for that position by the people of one
of the sovereign States thereof, should be con
ducted in a strictly Judicial manner, and that
In the proceedings the established rules of evi
dence should be applied. It Is well known to
everybody that this was not the case. It is
true that there was a strong effort made by
the honorable Senators from Alabama, Mary
land, Kansas and North Carolina at the be
ginning of the investigation to exclude all the
irrelevant testimony, but their efforts were un
availing.
It is not my desire to cast any aspersions
upon the motives which actuated the distin
guished Senators composing the committee, an<l
yet. with the most respectful consideration
for the learning, legal ability and eminent
standing of thes; gentlemen. I am forced to
the contention, which I believe meets with
the concurrence not only Qf a large number
of Senators on both i sides ' of this chamber,
but also of 80 per cent of my constituency In
the State of Montana, regardless of political
affiliations, that the methods of procedure in
the Investigation in this matter were man
ifestly unfair and non-Judlclal. and that they
resulted In a verdict of the committee entirely
opposite to that which would have occurred
should the evidence have been confined to that
which was admissible and pertinent to the
issue.
It had not been my Intention to disturb the
recognized traditions of this most honorable
body by Intruding my opinions upon any ques
tions that might arise for consideration dur
ing: the present seS3lon. but the question called
up to-day for discussion so vitally concerns
my own Interests and the Interests of the grt at
State which I have the honor in part to rep
resent, that I shall osk the Indulgence of the
Senate while I as briefly as possible submit
B)me remarks, referring, first, to the character
of the investigation; second, to the majority
report of the honorable Committee on Priv
ileges and Elections, which has submitted find-
Ings adverse to the retention of my seat In
the Senate: third, to the conditions existing
In the State of Montana for a number of years
prior to my election which Justified my po
litical actions, and, lastly, a statement as to
the course I deem best to pursue In the
premises.
During his address Clark said:
Arraigns the Committee.
Little other business of importance was
transacted. The resolution relating to
Mr. Clark went over until to-morrow,
and .the Senate proceeded to the trans
action of routine business.
At first his -words scarcely could be
heard, but as he proceeded his voice be
came clear and while at no time did he
speak loudly the "Intense earnestness of
his utterance carried his address to the
remotest parts of the chamber.
Ills address was a sharp arraignment
of the committee's action and report, an
analysis of the evidence produced at the
investigation, an explanation of political
and business affairs In Montana and a
bitter excoriation of Marcus Daly and his
friends.
As Mr. Clark adverted to his desire
to hand down to his children a name un
tarnished even by the breath of disgrace
tears welled to his eyes and his voice
trembled with- emotion. He almost brone
down. Then, bracing himself, he read the
letter he had sent to the Governor of
Montana tendering his resignation. At
the conclusion of the speech Mr. Clark
became the center of a group of Sena
tors, all desirous of pressing his hand.
At 12:30. Just as the routine business
was concluded, Clark quietly arose and
addressed the chair. He desired, he said.
In a low, tense voice, to address the Sen
ate on a question of privilege, personal
to himself. Instantly there was a buzz
of excitement in the chambers. Senators
from both sides of tho main aisle hurried
to seats near Mr. Clark and a hush fell
upon the assemblage as the Montana Sen
ator began to speak.
Mr. Clark struck Just at the instant the
Iron was hottest. Chandler, chairman of
the Committee on Privileges and Elec
tions, had given notice that at 1 o'clock
he would call up for consideration the
resolution unanimously reported from the
committee declaring Clark not to be en
titled to his seat In the Senate. A spirited
contest over the resolution was expected.
Every Senator in the city was at his desk.
The announcement came without pre
vious notice and probably not a half dozen
persons In Washington knew that it was
to be made.
WASHINGTON, May 13.â Mr. Clark of
Montana fairly swept the Senate with
surprise to-day by a formal announce
ment that he had sent his resignation as
Senator to the Governor of Montana.
dertaking was made with "the distinctly
expressed understanding that my name
snould not be used In connection with thÂ©
race, and I defy any one to
show that I was such a candidate until
after the election and not until In Decem
ber, 1S38."
Continuing Clark declared there was no
evidence to support the allegation that
money had been used to secure his elec
tion.
Spriggs Appoints Clark.

e nor r , Spriggs to-night appointed William
A. Clark of Butte United States Senator.
to serve until the next Legislature shall
elect his successor. Senator Clark's resig
nation was filed early in the day with the
Governor and to-night he was appointed
by Governor Spriggs to succeed himself.
Mr. Clark s reasons for resigning are
fully set forth in the speech he delivered
to-day In the Senate. Governor Spriggs
has all along- been a friend of Senator
Clark .during his candidacy for the Sen
ate and since, although he preserved the
utmost Impartiality In his office as Lieu
tenant Governor and president of the Sen
ate during the Senatorial campaign. Gov
ernor Smith, a partisan of the Â£)aly peo
ple, left the State two weeks ago for Cali
fornia to attend to some cases In which
he is retained as attorney. At that time
there was no thought of Senator Clarlc
resigning and hla enemies were confident
ne would be unseated by the United
States Senate. The resignation filed to
day came as a surprise to the people of
the State, who had no inkling of the coup
nrepared. During the day Governor
t-priggg received a great many telegrams
rrqm all over the State urging him to ap
point Senator Clark, alleging that he was
the real cholc? of a large majority of tho
R^,Â°sA ats and a \ a S SQ Proportion of the

steam can carry him. In an Interview he
said:
"You are the first party to Inform me
of the resignation of Senator Clark and
or his probable reappolntment by Lieu
tenant Governor Spriggs. I have just re
ceived a dispatch from Adjutant General
Nolan stating that Clark would probably
be appointed to-morrow (Wednesday), and
I. pray to God that I mav reach there In.
time to check this dastardly scheme which
has been concocted during my absence In
California. Clark is by no means the fa
vorite of the people of Montana, and it is
a blot upon the fair name of the State
to reappoint him after the report of the
Senate committee. . I am powerless to act
unless I arrive home before the appoint
ment is made. I knew that Spriggs was
a stanch friend of Claris, but did not
think he would dare oppose the will of
the people In this matter. It Is a well
laid and dastardly scheme, and I am
shocked to think that Lieutenant Gover
nor Sprigss entered into it. I never
dreamed of such a course being taken be
fore my departure for California and am
much grieved over it. but Spriggs will
have to answer to me and the people of
Montana for his action."
Clark Is Notified.
WASHINGTON. May 13.â Senator Clark

"The Boers, using artillery, attacked
the town Saturday. Very soon the Kaffir
location was In flames, some say as the
result of shell fire, others as the result of
treachery. Fighting at close quarters be

Kaffir location, from which point of van

town at close range.
"By an adroit move the garrison, de

actually surrounding the party of Boers

vere fighting followed, but according to
the latest reports the Boers still hold the

"The truth Is, I believe, that the Pre

Boers who came down here yesterday
from Pretoria produced for the edification
of incredulous Britishers two telegrams
received the following dispatch from Gen
eral Euller: -
"DUNDEE, May 15. 1 p. m.â We have
occupied Dundee. . About 2500 of the en
emy left yesterday for Glencoe, where
they entrained. Their wagons also left
yesterday by Dejagers Drift and the
Dannhauser road. Their Kaffirs said they
were going to Laings Nek. Almost every
house In Dundee Is completely looted. The
Navigation colliery is all right. The ma
chinery of the Dundee collieries is de
stroyed. The houses of the town are dam
aged but are structurally intact."
The War Office to-day furnished Hardy
confirmation of the Associated Press story
of yesterday telling of General Buller's
move on the BIggarsberg in a dispatch
from General Duller as follows:
'â¢KEMPS FARM, May 15.â The following
telegrams sent to Roberts are now re

Judging from the above dispatches, the
British advance is little more than an ar
duous march. The Boers,, who were ac
tive at first, later appear to have shown
the same readiness to retreat which Is
now marking the movements of the Fed

DESPERATE FIGHTING
REPORTED AT MAFEKING
LONDON, May 16.â A dispatch to the
Daily Mall from Lourenzo Marques, dated
Tuesday, says: "There is no doubt that
there was desperate fighting at Mafeking
Saturday, but it is believed to have gone
in favor of the garrison. All that can be
ascertained of a reliable character fol
lows:
NEW YORK, May 15.â The steamship
Maasdam, with the peace envoys from the
South African republics, arrived at this
port to-day, after a voyage of twelve days
from Rotterdam. The envoysâ Abraham
Fischer, J. A. A. Woolraarens and C. P.
Wesselsâ were met by a committee which
went down the bay to greet them, and
later were welcomed by a larger body of
sympathizers gathered on the pier at Ho
boken, where the Maasdam docked. The
Mayor of that city extended a welcome to
them and the party then took carriages
for the Hotel Manhattan, where the en
voys will lodge during their stay in this
city.
The ship was sighted off Fire Island
early this morning, and the sub-committee
appointed to go down the bay embarked
on the revenue cutter Hudson and met
the Maasdam at Quarantine. On the ar
rival of the ship there were introductions
all around, ana then ex-Judge Van Hoe
sen recited the following address of wel
came:
"We are a committee of citizens of New
lork who sympathize with your country
in its struggle for liberty and independ
ence and who wish to make your visit
to. the city of New York agreeable to you
personally and advantageous to the nation
of which you are the representatives. In
the near luture we will extend to you a
more formal reception, but on this occa
sion we simply say 'welcome.' "
Mr. Fischer responded to Judge Van
Hoesen, saying:
"1 thank you most heartily for this wel
come which you have just extended to us.
The warmth of a welcome does not He in
the length ot words used, but in* deeds.
\\ e believe that the American people will
also extend to us a hearty welcome, for
ours is a cause that is dear to their
hearts. We are fighting for our country.
As soon as they come to understand our
cause they will I believe, echo the wel
come you have just given us."
The Maasdam was saluted by harbor
shipping on her way up. When -the ship
arrived at Hoboken the pier was crowded
with men and women waving the stars
and stripes and the colors of the South
African republics. The three envoys were
the first to leave the vessel. As they came
down the gangway a brass band on the
pier struck up the Boer national hymn,
the crowd on the dock cheered ana ves
sels near by tooted a welcome to the dele
gates.
Mayor Kajran of Hoboken delivered an
address of welcome and tendered the v!b
ltors the freedom of the city.
Chairman Fischer of the delegation re
plied on behalf of the envoys. Then the
delegates were escorted . to carriages at
the end of the pier. There a 'procession
was formed, headed by a band of music;
the procession passing through Washing
ton street, past the City Hall, to the Bar
clay-street ferry, where the envoys were
taken in charge by the committee of 100
from New York, and the whole party
crossed the ferry to New York, where the
envoys were escorted to the Hotel-Man
hattan. Along the route from the Hol
land-American line dock to the ferry
there were crowds who gave an enthusi
astic welcome to the envoys of the South
African republics.
At the hotel the envoys were received by
the executive committee of the citizens'
reception committee. Edward Lauterback,
who was among the speakers, caused
something of a sensation by bitterly de
nouncing the Irish race, declaring that
they had forgotten in a short time the bit
ter experiences they had had with Eng
land, and Irish regiments were now fight
ing to aid the empire.
Kach -of the envoys spoke in reply to
the addresses of welcome.
- Delegate Fischer, In the course of his
speech, said: "We come to seek peace,
but not at any price. We don't Intend to
be murdered out of existence. We ask
that. you investigate our cause. If you
find it wrong, then we will submit to being
made practical slaves and give up our
lands. If we are right, then we want you
to help us to maintain the things we have
won at great sacrifice."

have been heavy.
CONFLICTING REPORTS
CONCERNING MAFEKING
LONDON, May 15.â A special dispatch
from Lorenzo Marques says it is reported
that a large force of Boers has been cap
tured by the British at Maf eking. Pre
toria, it is added, reports, on the other
hand, that Mafeking has fallen.
LORENZO MARyUES, Mav 15.âTele
grams, received here report very heavy
lighting at Mafeking. Pretoria reports
that Mafeking has ? fallen, and The
Netherlands Railroad Company has Issued
a statement that Colonel Baden-Powell
has captured a large force of Boers.
A war bulletin posted at Pretoria May 12
announced that the British are advancing
to the relief of Mafeking.
The, Boers Saturday occupied the Kafflr
location at Mafeking. They were in turn
attacked during the night of Saturday and
on Sunday found themselves surrounded.
The Boers lost seven killed and seventeen

to capture Baden-Powell -with 900 this

"There is no doubt about the heavy
fighting-. A- telegram from the Portu
guese Consul to the Governor General
here confirms this, and there Is little
doubt of , the occupation of the Kaffir
stadt. But similar telegrams were pub
lished at Pretoria about Ladysmith. and
quite recently about Wepener, Just belore
Colonel Dalgety was relieved.
BOER PEACE ENVOYS
WELCOMED UPON ARRIVAL
LONDON. May l&-4:30 a. m.-"Food
will ldst until about June 10," is the
latest word from Colonel Baden-
Powell, the British commander at
Mafeking, sent to Lord Roberts un
der date of May T. Five days later tho
Boers attempted to storm the town, and
it is possible that they succeeded, al
though nothing is known of the attack or
of Its results, except through Pretoria
sources, which have no countenance here.
The British relief column is due there
now. Ten days ago General Snyman was
having difficulty In keeping the burghers
together, owing to the approach of the
British, and when the last Associated
Press dispatch left Ma'eklng.'On May 7,
the Boers had killed, on the previous day,
one of the horse guards and had captured
several of Colonel Baden-^owell's lew re
maining horses.
Major F. D. Bailie has sent to the Morn
ing I'ost from Maf eking, under' date of
Muy 7. thi6 message: . ...
â¢â¢This morning tne Boers attacked us.
Result as usual. There Is an aching void
here. Pass tho loaf."
The Transvaal army has taken a posi
tion at Blnauwbascndoort Pass, near
Heilbron road station, lifty miles north of
Kxoonstad. lt& rear guard Is btill holding
the hills north of Valsch River, while
the LJoer scouts are in touch with British
reconnoiterlng parties twenty miles north
of Kroonstad.
The Boers have held a council of war
at Llngley and British spies have learned
that tho Boers decided to hold liaxrismith
as long as possible.
Lord Rooerts' infantry are Btlll at
Kroonstad. The railway laborers are hard
at work and the engineers hope to have
the line repaired wltnin three days.
The prairie has put on a russet winter
coat. The nights ure bitter cold, but the
days are hot.
The Free Staters are surrendering in
larger numbers than alter the occupation
of Bloemfomeln. One oÂ«lcer or the
Transvaal artillery says: "There will be
no serious lighting this side or Pretoria,
as Bereehigen, on the Vaal, is indefen
sible. Heavy guns are being mounted at
Pretoria. Both Generals Botha and Llm
mer are agreed that ultimate success Is
Impossible. President Kruger is obstinate
and a majority ot tho Transvaalers hold
iirmly with him."
It la estimated that the Transvaalers
can still muster 30,000 men on tho fighting
lino.
General B-uller's advance, as his tele
grams indicate, was by Lord Roberts' in
structions, and it will cease or go forward
as Lord Roberts directs. It is said that
General Buller's orders to keep the Boers
employed have been supplemented by an
oraer to drive them completely out of
Natal and then to move on Harrlsmith.
General Rundlo and General Brabant
are taking possession of the wide regions
around Lauybrand almost without oppo
sition. Thev find the country plentifully
supplied with cattle, horsefeed and flour.
General Rundle is reducing his transport
and feeding his men and animals largely
off the country.
The Boers in that quarter surrender
daily and it is the expectation of the cor
respondents on the spot that the eastern
section of the Free State will soon be as
tranquil as the western. General Rundle's
front is thirty miles long, but his forces
are disposed so that if any point should
be attacked the troops there could be
quickly reinforced.
Lord Roberts contributes a lino to the
discussion going on in the press as to
when the war will end by the following
telegram, dated Monday and sent through
a correspondent who had made the direct
Inquiry:
"I regret that I cannot give any reply to
your question, as it is impossible at pres
ent to predict when the campaign will
end."
The view of the other side Is reported
by a correspondent to- whom President
Steyn said: "Sooner than leave this coun
try to fall into the hands of the British
I would destroy all our houses and leave
It a desert."
The relations between the Transvaal
and Portugal appear to be strained. The
Portuguese Consul at Pretoria, according
to reports from Lisbon, has been ordered
by President Kruger to leave the coun
try. The Portuguese declaration making
food and clothing contraband has nearly
destroyed the usefulness of Delagoa Bay
to the Transvaal.
Senhor Joaquin Machado, Governor
Ger.eral of Portuguese East Africa, is be
ing entertained at Beira and the English
officers who are passing through are
showing him courtesies. The Lisbon Cab
inet is understood to count on British pro
tection in the event of Boer aggression.
All the morning papers give long ac
counts of the reception of the Boer dele
gates in New York, but none of them
comment editorially except the Dally
Chronicle and the Times, the former of
which says:
"To give a parallel instance, suppose
that during the course of the Hispano-
American war the Spaniards had asked
England to Intervene and had sent a dep
utation to Queen Victoria. Would the
Spanish delegates have been received
with cheers and presented with the free
dom of the city of Southampton or of the
meanest township in the vicinity? This
difference between the temper of the Eng
lish people toward America and that of
the American populace toward England
will take a good deal to explain away."
The War Office last evening Issued an
abstract of British casualties since the
beginning of the war. This shows a total
of 20,035. exclusive of the sick in the field
and the Invalids, Including the wounded
sent home, who number 8901.

It was all too palpable, too bald and
nauseating even to those that had to sub

loud guffaw echoed through the conven

PARIS, May 15.â A fire occurred at the
exposition this afternoon.* The flames
were discovered in the basement of the
Chateau d'Eau. which, is expected to be I
one of the leading features of the' ex
hibition. â¢ '- .
Intense alarm was caused by the blaze,
as it was feared the adjoining: Salles des
Fetes might become involved. The Amer
ican section of the Palace of Electricity
would in that case have been one of the
first places to suffer.
The efforts of the firemen, however,
succeeded in localizing: the outburst and
after ran hour's hard work the flre was
extinguished, with apparently slight dam
age to a portion of the woodwork be
r.eath the Chateau d'Eau and a few tap
estries.
The news of the fire spread quickly
through Paris and aroused considerable
anxiety, owing to the recent severe criti
cism of the inadequate arrangements to
cope with a -conflagration. A column of
smoke issuing from the* chateau first be
trayed, the presence of. fire and an alarm"
was then raised by the mechanics who
are still working on the installation of the
ralace of Electricity. ;
The -fire, was dueto the fusing of the
wires, which ignited the scaffolding un
derneath- the chateau. The special fire
corps attached to the exposition arrived
promptly and began the work of extin
guishing the flames.
In the meanwhile great excitement pre
vailed 'among the visitors, who- flocked to
the scene. The police threw cordons
around the chateau, from which the dense
smoke issued chiefly through the crevices
of the terraces forming the cascades, but
no flames could be perceived from the
outside. Â¦ ~ â¢Â¦ Â¦
The Minister of Commerce, M. Mille
rand: the Prefect of . Pollce,\M. Lepine;
the Commissioner General of the exposi
tion, S. M. Picard; and General Dalstein
reached the scene very quickly and aided
In the direction of the police and;: fire
brigade. The workmen : in the basement
had narrow escapes and three were near
ly asphyxiated when rescued. >
-" The I outbreak i was confined to 'Â¦- the
ground floor of the chateau, where. much
woodwork and decorative hangings were
destroyed. - 'â¢'.
As M. Lepine feared the flre might have
impaired the foundations, he caused the
galleries and halls' underneath the "cha
teau to be evacuated until the experts de
clare there Is no danger of collapse.

MANILA. April 15.â The most sensa
tional of the events of the past week haa
been the general distribution by the Jes
uits of a pamphlet in whioh is set forth
the "truths which Christians must ob
serve." Some of the things most strongly
condemned by the Jesuits in this pamph

act of the Jesuits is considered by many
to be an attack upon the American admin
istration.
The pamphlet In question says: <1) "The
commands of the church must be obeyed
in the same manner as the law of God.
(2) You must subject your own judgment
to that of the church and think exactly
as the church thinks, for the church can
not be overcome. Â»3) You must reject and
condemn the Masonic sect, so frequently
rejected and condemned by the Supreme
Pontiff?. <4) You must also reject and
condemn liberty of worship, liberty of the
press, liberty cf thuught and the other
liberties of perdition, condemned and re

reject and condemn liberalism and alsa
modern progress and civilization as being
false progress and false civilization. <6>
You must utterly abominate civil mar

<7> You must also -condemn and reject the

belief that the church has by its origin i.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C. May 15.â A dramatic
climax to the proceedings against John T.
Elliott, who claims to be related to Lord
Mlnto, and Is charged with forgery, took
place this morning, when the prisoner
made an attempt on his life In the police
dock. Elliott is a brother of Sir Henry
Elliott and a scion of the house to which
the present Governor General belongs. He
ha3 had no correspondence with his
friends and his chief concern lay In con
cealing his disgrace from them. He con
fessed, when arrested, that he had made
up his mind to commit suicide, but con
cluded that such a course would only add
publicity to the matter and bring It to the
ears of his folks in England. It was the
Impression that his crime was about to be
made public that finally led to the step
which has placed his life , In Imminent
danger. â¢
When the case was called this morning
It was noticed that Elliotr kept his atten
tion riveted upon George Powell, who
was employed as counsel in a case which
was to be called after that of Elliott.
Mr. Powell was writing letters in the In
terim and Elliott Jumped to the conclu
sion, as he afterward confessed, that Mr.
Powell was a reporter, and that* his al
leged offense. was about to be paraded be
fore the . public. He had decided previ
ously what he would do ln certain given
circumstances, and the spectators noticed
that he began to take something from his
pocket and transfer It to his mouth. At
this point - the court mentioned that he
would call anoher witness.
Elliott replied: "What's the use? You
don't want any more. I might as well tell
you that there Is a change of venue or
dered in this case and that It will be be
fore a higher assize ln a few hours." De
tective Palmer had noticed that Elliott
appeared to be chewing- something and
accordingly asked him if It was tobacco.
"I'm chewing, but It's not tobacco," re
sponded the prisoner, and the detective's
suspicions were aroused.
Consequently the man was removed
from the dock, when It was found that
he had been deliberately chewing broken
glass ln order to destroy his life. He had
obtained a bottle in jail and this was
broken Into pieces which he had secreted
In his pocket and with which lie hoped to
circumvent the ways of justice.
Dr. Fraser was summoned to attempt to
save the life of the prisoner, but the lat
ter assured him that there was no use of
trying: to do anything, as he had read a
book on suicide and knew exactly how to
proceed- about it. The man, however, la

feature In the street car situation to-day
was a riot which broke out on the open
ing of the Grand avenue line of the St.

of which twe men were shot. At night

were at the same time yesterday, i The
officials of the railroad company, mem
bers of the- employes' grievance commit

were in session for five hours to-day ln
an endeavor to reconcile the differences.
No agreement was arrived at and

The Suburban Company, pursuant . to
the agreement effected yesterday with Its
striking employes, ran on full schedule
day and night. This is the first time since
the strike began on the road that a night
schedule was maintained.
" Five lines were operated during the day
by the Transit Company, all shutting
down at dark. Â¦ Very Irregular schedules
were maintained on these lines.
The trouble on the Grand avenue line
occurred at Eastern avenue about 4
o'clock. Stones and boards piled upon
the tracks . caused a blockade of a half
dozen or more cars. Each car was man
ned by a crew and six. policemen. When
the policemen got down to remove the
obstructions they were greeted by cries
of. "scab!" from a crowd of strikers. and
their sympathizers. A volley of stones
followed and in retaliation shots were
fired from several of the cars. John Flat
ley, a striking motorman, had his spine
shattered by a bullet, and Joseph Tren
dall, an onlooker, was shot in the hip.

NEW YORK. May 15.â Mies KatherlnÂ©
Gray, actress, and "Jack"' Mason, actor,
have been married. Jersey City is said to
have been the scene of the nuptials one
day last week, but the exact day Is not
known. Both -Air. and Mrs. Mason are
reticent on the subject. Their friends ln
this city received cards to-day announc
ing that the wedding had taken place,
and that was all â no date, place, brldfts
tnsid nor best man. The cards came from
Boston, where Mason Is playing with
Daniel Frohman's etock company this
wc-ek. Mrs. Mason Is there, too.
The news spread rapidly along the Ri
alto, and there were some persons â there
always are such persons â who professed
that they had expected It all along. Oth
ers, however, and they were In majority,
expressed genuine and honest surprise.
Both Miss Gray and Mason are widely
known in the theatrical profession. Miss
Gray has been Richard Mansfield's lead-
Ing lady several times. Last winter, while
Mansfield was playing at the Garden The
ater here, she suddenly retired from his
company and soon afterward sued him
for her season's salary, alleging that he
had made her 111 and forced her to resign
by his harsh treatment. This Mansfield
emphatically denied. Later she joined
Mrs. Sarah Cowell Le Moyne's company
ln "The Greatest Thing . in the World,"
and continued to play in that piece till
the season closed recently. She has been
engaged for the summer stock company
ln Washington, and It was said last even
ing that rehearsals of that organization
had to be postponed to allow her to go
on to Boston to be married. She is a
Californian. and was at one time the wife
of Paul Arthur, an American actor who
has made a gTeat reputation as a mem
ber of George Edwards' company in Lon
don. They were divorced quite a while
ago. Mason Is at present leading man of
Daniel Frohman's stock company. He Is
a Bostonlan and comes of a wealthy and
prominent Massachusetts family. He
married Marion Manola several years ago
and for a long time they starred together
in comic opera. Then there came rumors
of trouble between them. A year or so
ago they separated entirely and a few
months ago the first Mrs. Mason secured
a divorce ln this city. ,

BAN RAFAEL. May 15.-If their state
ments be true Lena Tafanelli. Jlgllo Taf
aneUl and Pletro Stefanl. three children
staying at the Italia Hotel on Fourth
street, were almost the victims of a das
tardly attempt made upon their lives by a
vengeful Chinaman yesterday.
Yesterday morning the three children
went oui to play, returning as usual at
noon. Shortly after the midday meal
Lena Tafanelli complained of pains. The
other tÂ»u also cried out that their mouths
burned. On examination their mouths
were found to be blackened Inside as
though by cauFtic action. An hour later
all were vomiting and writhing in the
greatest agony. Dr. Wickman was called
in by Antone Stefani. the boy's father,
and after administering emetics, pro
nounced the children out of danger. Some
crystals contained in a bottle, found on the
elaest girl. Lena, he declared to be caustic
potash, an alkaline of similar properties
only much purer and more powerful than
lye. '
When questioned as to how they came
into possession of the bottle, Lena said
that they had teased a Chinaman for
candy and on his refusing to give it to
them had pelted him with stones. The
Chinaman retreated, but returned later
with a bottle, which he told them con
tained candy. They all ate freely of the
white crystals, but beyond a slight burn
ing, felt no ill effects till they were taken
rick. Antone Stefani, father of the boy
Metro and guardian of the two little girls,
ridicules Lena's story and says the chil
dren found the poison In a lot. Lena
Tafanelli. however, is positive ln her
story, and the tact that caustic potash is
used by laundrymen ln cases where lye
Is tco weak lends color to her tale. An
Investigation will be made.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE. May 15.â Next' Monday the
voters of San Jose must determine
whether the gang yoke will be stricKen
from their necks, or. whether the city
must run along in the same old rut, with
gang politicians dominating Its municipal
affairs. For years San, Jose has suffered
from the rule of political bosses, and hun
dreds of home-seekers have been, driven
from the city because of the expensive
ness and highhandedness of the city
officials. The citizens' committee of one
hundred : is determined this order of
things shall change, and they have ap
pealed to the voters to support their
ticket, headed by Edwards for Mayor, so
that San Jose may enjoy the boom that
is sure to follow the closing of the gup
and the completion of the coast road this
fall.
The issue of the city campaign is gang
or anti-gang, and no voter can dodge the
Issue. One must either be for progress
and a greater San Jose or else bow to
the Rea or Mackenzie forces that have so
long disrupted the schools and Fire and
Police departments. When the' voters
step to the ballot-box Monday It will.be
a battle royal between Edwards and
Martin, and everything points to the
success of the former.
Both sides have opened headquarters.
The citizens' committee has rooms in
the Knox block, while Mayor Martin has
given the gang us<j of a storeroom in his
block, the Bristol, on South Second
street. â â¢
The gang is making desperate efforts to
line up backsliders. Business men . are
being Importuned and even .threatened.
Precinct meetings have been Inaugurated,
and small boys and ward-heelers are
finding profitable employment as spec
tators. A long list of gang committee
men has been published, but even some
of the old standbys have left the party,
and others in the list have hastened
around to the citizens' headquarters and
announced that their names had been
used without authority.
The gang has appointed special whips to
see that the employes of the various city
departments are in line. For the past
two years members of the 1 Fire Depart
ment were compelled to work six weeks
for nothing, policemen three weeks and
school teachers and Janitors also forced
to lose some of their salaries because the
various funds were empty. All this time
Mavor Martin's eon, H. J. Martin, was
enjoving the greatest sinecure of the city
âsecretary of the Police and Fire Com
mission, at $1200 per year. These people

SELECTION OF STATE
| CHAIRMAN THE ISSUE
So-Called "Anti-Boss" Element of the
Kansas Republicans Oppose Al
baugh for Re-election.
TOPEKA, Kans.. May 15.â The real is
sue in the Republican State Convention,
which will assemble here at 11 o'clock to
morrow, will be the selection of a chair
man of the State committee to succeed
Morton Albaugh. who is a candidate for
re-election. Albaugh is ldentlfled with the
Leland element of the party and Is being
vigorously opposed by the so-called anti
boss faction.
Th*re Is a contest for only one place on
the ticketâ that of Congressman at large.
Charles F. Scott of Iola and D. W. Blalne
of Pratt are the candidates, * with the
chances ln favor of the former.
The antl-Leland delegates to the num
ber of 324 held a caucus this afternoon and
decided to carry the fight over the State
committee Into the convention and at
tempt to overturn the old custom of per
mitting the committee to choose its chair
man. They are, however, divided on the
issue.
It is understood that Cyrus Leland Is
not a candidate for re-election as nation
al commltteeman and it' is probable that
M. A. Low will be elected.
The resolutions will Indorse the na
tional administration In every particular
and the delegates to Philadelphia will bo
Instructed to vote for the renomination of
President McKlnley.
CANDIDATES WITHDRAW
AT KANSAS CITY
Organization and Naming of Com-
mittees Consumes the Day at
Republican Convention.*
KANSAS CITY, May 15.â The Republi
can State Convention to-day got no fur
ther ln their deliberations than to effect
a temporary organization and name com
mittees. This they accomplished at the
morning session. The afternoon session
was taken up with speech-making and a
lively fight over a motion to escort Web
ster Davis to the platform to address the
gathering.
The most Important Incident of the day
was the withdrawal from the race for
delegates at large of Major William War
ner of Kansas City, who, in answering a
call for a speech, declared emphatically
that he would not permit his name to be
used ln this connection. He understood,
he said, that his candidacy has caused
friction and this he wished to avoid.
With the added reiteration of National
Commltteeman Kerens that he would un
der no circumstances become a delegate at
larjje the fight for these honors, which la
the principal one of the convention, was
simplified. The convention will doubtless
finish Its work to-morrow. ,
Republicans of Wyoming.

pected that the full complement of 103

A GOOD COMPLEXION
Depends on Good Digestion.
Th'.s Ss almost an axiom, although us-
ually we are apt to think that cosraetlrs,
face powder*, lotions, fancy soaps, etc.,
are the secrets for securing a clear c>'.m-
-j.lexion. But ail these are simply super-
ficial assistants.
It Is impossible to hare a good complex-
ion ur.'rss the digestive organs perform
their work properly; unless the stomach
by properly digesting the food taken Into
It furnishes an abundance of pure blood,
& rood complexion Is impossible.
This Is the reason bo many ladies are
using Stuart's Dyepepsla Tablets, because
they promptly cure any stomach trouble
arid they have found out that perfect di-
gestion means a perfect complexion and
one that does not require cosmetics and
powders to enhance its beauty.
Many ladies diet themselves or deny
themselves many articles of food solely in
order to keep their complexion clear.
"When Stuart's Dyspepsia tablets are used
no such dieting is necessary; take these
tablets and eat all the good, wholesome
food you want and you need have no fear
of Indigestion nor the sallow, dull com-
plexion which nine women out of ten
have, solely because they are suffering
from some form of indigestion.
Bear ln mind that beauty proceeds from
pood health, good health results from per-
fect digestion and we have advanced the
beet argument to Induce every man and
Â¦woman to give this splendid remedy a
triaL '
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets can be found
In drug- stores and costs but 50 cents per
package.
If there Is any derangement of the
etomach or bowels they will remove It and
the rcFultant effects are good digestion,
crood health and a clear, bright complex-
ion.

1 â Â» ORF.ST fires have become so common in the
I United States that unless they be of extraor
* dinsry magnitude they arc almost unnoted oat
side the State where they occur. Thus the extant of
the annual ravage of such fires is never fully known
to the people at large, and consequently the impor
tance of forest protection is not understood.
An illustration of how large a fire may occur in
the woods of a thickly settled State without attracting
attention elsewhere is to be found in the Philadelphia
papers giving an account of forest fires around
Dubois. Perm., on May 8. Hardly anything more
than a bare mention was given of the occurrence in
the telegraphic dispatches to the country- at large,
and yet in any other land than the United States the
disaster would have been a nine days' wonder.
From the reports given in the Philadelphia Public
Ledger it appears the fire raged around Dubois all
day long. In the afternoon it Â¦was augmented by a
wind amounting almost to a tornado, but fortunately
the wind brought up storm clouds, and early in the
evening a torrent of rain fell and quenched the
flames. The amount of damage was large. We are
told the flames rushed along with the wind upon the
village of Raintown and wiped it out of existence-
Three children perished in the flames and many per
sons were severely burned., At London Mines a
number of buildings occupied by the employes of the
coal and iron companies were burned. Many
houses at the village of Winterburn were consumed,
and but for a change in the wind the whole" village
would have been destroyed. All through the country
side farmhouses, barns and mills were - destroyed.
Another dispatch in the same paper and of the same
date says: "All the buildings in the village of Cor-
I bett. Porter County, Perm., were destroyed by forest
: fires this afternoon, and several persons were badly
burned. There is much anxiety among the women
regarding the safety of their husbands and sons who
are ia the lumber camps near Corbett, surrounded by
the forest fires. It is thought at least half a dozen
I persons perished in the flames."
It is with .such a widespread calamity the season
of forest fires for this year has opened in Pennsyl
vania. The destruction of buildings entails a loss of
many thousands of dollars, and there is no computing
how tnnch value has been destroyed in the woods
themselves. Yet such a disaster has received but little
attention even in the States adjoining Pennsylvania.

The Merchants' Association has already on hand so
much work in the way of public improvement that it
is doubtful if it can undertake charitable work as well.
The plan of Mr. Davis; is, however, an exceptionally
good one. If carried out with proper administrative
detail it would result . in widespread benefits to the
merchants and to the charitable organizations of the
dry, and it therefore merits attentive sttidj and con
sideration. .
As a part of the plan proposed it is said the board
should have the right to exact that those who con
tribute to the fund bind themselves to subscribe only
through the relief association -to such institutions as
are placed upon its list, as otherwise the very object
of the organization would be defeated.
To avoid the evils of indiscriminate giving, while
at the same time affording more effective help where
it is needed, .Mr. Davis says: "Let a fund, to be
known as the San Francisco merchants' relief fund,
be created, this fund to be made up of self-imposed
contributions from not only the merchants of this city
but from every and all available sources. Further,
let the fund thus created be distributed among the
various philanthropic institutions of our city and
county, according to their merits and interests; and,
finally, a competent board of directors should be se
lected to take charge of this workâ men who will not
alone direct the distribution of the fund, but who will
devote the time necessary properly to carry on such a
work. A plan of administration will naturally develop
as the work progresses, and the fund at the disposal
of the board should increase as its efficiency and in
fluence widen." ~
n NDREW M. DAVIS contributes to the enr
/ \ rent number of the Merchants' Association
* Â¦Â¦ Review an interesting plan by which the asso
ciation can be made a potent helper in the work of
charity and the members relieved from much of the
importunate demand upon them for contributions to
all sorts of philanthropic schemes, many of which arc
philanthropic in name only and hardly worthy of
he'p.
It is pointed out 'that we have in San Francisco
"a generous public, which in a benevolent and un
inquiring way pours thousands of "dollars annually
into outstretched hands." The merchant is the
shining mark for every appeal; and, as Mr. Davis
says: "So confidently is he expected to subscribe to
every cause â good, bad or â¢ indifferent â that he
scarcely feels himself free to refuse. He knows that
a certain amount of fraud and imposition is practiced
upon him, but being in no position to make investi
gations he gives mechanically, indifferently, and often
against the dictates of his better judgment"

Mr. Morrison's trip to the coast was out

the Horn from New York in a sailing

to be several years younger than when
he was last here.
In speaking of the outlook for the com

all of the Eastern theaters are doing a

ILLINOIS has j"st had an experience in Republi
can politics which should teach and exhort.
Ch.ia.go, Cook County, has a delegation of 5&0
members in the Illinois Republican State Convention.
A boss, three bosses, in fact, a sort of federation cf
bo5?es, gave notice thst they would deliver this dele
gation Â£t the Feoria convention to Judge Hanecy for
Governor, snd would also cse it for other purposes,
more or 3e-s profitable snd interesting.
The Republican press of Chicago at once pointed
C"\ xhzt if this boss business ruled the State conven
ticn. the place o: Illinois in the Republican column
would be in jeopardy. Reputable- ir:en:bers of the
party, desirous of its success, took up the matter,
with the resui: that the federated bosses were whole
iomdjr uhipped cut of the-r boots. Judge Yates was
7 - in2tcd tor Governor, and the pernicious para
site* who had fastened upon the pany were as com
plete-}- clrased out as a colony of cottony cushion
Kale :? by the Veda^ia Austral:?. In other Eastern
States there is the same wholesome indication that the
Republican party is resentir.g exposure on the auction
block this year, for sale to the highest bidder by any
bc^s or combination of bosses.
This is we"! for the party everywhere, and it will bs
we:I for it in California if the Sacrarrjemo convention
reed the sigr.s of the times and stand up for the inde
pendence and manhood of the organization. It is
hardly worth while to sacrifice a national victory to
please a few putrid bosses, â¢whose reputation is spumy
with the s'.ime of thie slums oi city politics. Such
men do net make party issues nor secure party sac
cess any more than ticks on a cow give milk like the
crecture they torment by burrowing in her hide.
The Republican party will not permit parasites to
thrive on it. It does its business in the open. It is
the pecp!e, who have nothing to conceal and have at
bean the doing of real service to the country. Calt
forr:ia Republicans won a conspicuous victory in the
Leg-islarure. which sent the bosses to the rear, when
Senator Bard was elected. That act was worth 20.000
votes in this State. The Sacramento convention
shou'd rot throw them away by subjecting itself to the
bosses who were repudiated and rejected only a few
months ago.
Let it be inspired by the example of Illinois, and
go fcrward straigfctJy in the high path of that public
(decency which has ever characterized the party since
its foundation, and when November comes it will get
its regard.
BOSSES OVERTHROWN
The early Christians knew that no human being could be
perfectly good, and yet they believed that perfection was re
quired of them. Hence a redeemer who could impart to them
his goodness was necessary. With the wider outlook which we
have to-day we see that such a miraculous intervention Is
not needed. Our idea of perfection has been modified by the
discovery of the laws of human development. Just as we per
ceive that It Is nearer to the truth to believe In a boundless In
stead of a narrow world, so also we accept the idea of progress
and character culture. In short, a new temper of mind has
been created, which Is unfavorable to the acceptance of the
old dogmas.
Many are unable from some sentimental reasons to give
up the old beliefs, even though they have accepted the new
For instance, the orthodox doctrine of a redeemer rests
upon the assumption that a man must be perfectly good In
order to be acceptable to his Maker. This doctrine implies
that a man is either altogether good or not good at all. It is
plainly contrary to the modern idea of development, which
teaches that the Impossible is not required of us. Absolute
perfection Is unattainable, but we know that the road to per
fection lies open and that if we would be men in the highest
sense we must travel it.
and we perish. Underneath our feet still blaxe the eternal
fires that were kindled when this earth lay on the bosom of its
parent sun. Above our heads we can see the unending array
of young worlds and old worlds and dead worlds.
This new conception of the earth does not logically contra
dict the old dogmatic beliefs, but it creates an attitude of
mind unfavorable to them.
X the light of the new astronomy our earth has dwindled."
I We have learned that we live on the outer shell 4 of a little
globe, which is but a mere speck of dust amid the infinities,
not as we formerly supposed the center of the universe. We
pigmies dwell in a few protected nooks of this outer shell
of the earth. A little too much heat or a little too much cold
There Is an Intrinsic Caw In the mlnfi which win not allow
us to conceive of Infinity. We cannot Imagine what an infinite
bÂ«lng is. We cannot think of a God like us. and therefore we
cannot In any adequate sense take an Infinite being as a pat
tern. Man cannot be godlike; but he can- feel that he Is sus
ceptible to influences that come from a divine source. More
and more we are learning to rely upon htnnan effort and not
upon miraculous Interference. We depend upon the development
of our own Ideas and powers, not upon any especial revelation
or Imputed righteousness
We cannot get sufficient help In our polltlc&l or conjugal cr
industrial duties from the teaching of the New Testament. The
doctrine of brotherly love In the abstract Is not enough. The
whole social problem is how to properly apply the principles of
brotherhood. How shall love express Itself? That is the crccial
Question.
We must constantly bÂ« prepared to receive new Ideas asd ea

Sooner or later that issue will have to be met It
â¢comes to the front at every step taken toward tele
phone regulation. There seems but one way to deal
with it effectively, and that is "to so amend the city
charter as to give the Supervisors authority to regu
late telephone corporations in the same manner that
other corporations controlling and operating public
utilities are operated. It is fortunate for the people
that the various questions growing out of the exac
tions and the tax-shirking of the telephone corpora
tion have been brought to an issue on the eve of a
State election, as the election renders it possible for
the people to deal with them promptly and conclu
sively. In all parts of the Union the extortions and
inadequate sen-ice of the telephone corporations have
aroused public indignation, and efforts are being mads
in all progressive communities to protect the public
rights. It is an issue which must be settled, and the
Supervisors are doing good service in striving to
bring about reform of telephone abuses in this ci>y.
In taking this step the Supervisors were met by the
old cry that the reform would entail further expense
on the part of the corporation and that it would re
sult in an increased charge upon the patrons of the
line. The suggestion that such would be the effect
of the ordinance was made by Supervisor Branden
stein. It is a repetition of the assertion made by an
official of the corporation in another connection, that
any increase of expense would be "put in the bill."
An excessive number of telephone instruments
upon any one line works a wrong not only to the
parties whose instruments are on the line, but to all
the patrons of the company, for frequently those who
have an exclusive line find it impossible to get the
desired switch on the party line because it is occu
pied by one of its numerous connections. The meas
ure, therefore, promises to remedy one of the abuses
of the corporation, zsid may be expected to prove
highly beneficial to the public
ANOTHER step in the direction of telephone
regulation was taken by the Board of Super
visors on Monday in passing to print Super
visor McCarthy's ordinance providing that no person
or company engaged in supplying a telephone ser
vice to the city or its inhabitants shall maintain more
than five telephone instruments upon any one party
line. The intent of the ordinance is to compel the
corporation to give a service commensurate with the
prices charged, and is fully justified by the unfair
manner in which the company now carries on its
TELEPHONE REGULATIONS.
Although Quay lost his seat in the Senate, the re

All other issues are really side issues, except finance
and protection. Bryan raises them to get votes. If
he get power he cannot affect the South African
struggle prosecuted by "our best friend," according
to Dewey, nor can he under his theory disentangle
the PhJI-ppjne matter. All that he can do is to get
out his hammer and smash our financial system.
That is what he intends to do, and the purpose of the
"thrill*' which is to shake every railroad right of way
as he pass-es is to make people forget his real purpose.
His more frank supporters, like Colonel Patterson
of Colorado, declare, however, that his power over
Cer.cre?s will be supreme, and that the free silver
ir.an of Colorado who falters in the support of Bryan
is a traitor to his State.
The real purpose of Colonel Bryan is to get power
to accomplish the financial vagaries of the Chicago
platform. He recurs to those propositions as per
sistently as Mr. Dick did to the head of Charles I.
Even his supporters plead for him that the recent gold
standard bill cannot be disturbed, and therefore
Colonel Bryan cannot do the harm which he intends.
Surely it is a novel plea for a candidate, that he will
not be able to destroy the financial integrity of the
country because he is prevented by a law that he will
not be able to repeal!
The suggestion by a member of Colonel Bryan's
ccrr.mittee of such a combination is, after all, evi
dence of the straining for effect and reaching out for
some expedient which will make the Presidential elec
tion go off on something besides the principle in
volved.
The proof of the political pudding is in chewing the
string. But here is a string that has anti-expansion
and Angiophobia at one end, and expansion and
Anglomania at the ether. The pudding will be of un
certain character, as if it were a mixture of plum and
that dark link and toothsome known in the market
place as "blutwursL"'
Again, when Colonel Bryan stands on that well
worn car platform and with uplifted eye and voice
that fearlessly soars or. an oratorical trapeze, without
even such a safety appliance as a parachute, with
tremolo stop pulled out and his face shining with
prophetic fervor, discloses all about that "notorious
secret treaty with Great Britain," the public forgettery
v ill be called into action for a still more serious duty.
During his still swinging swing around the circle
Admiral Dewey sat at the banquet board with the
University Club in St. Louis. He was led to talk
aÂ£out our superiority as a fighting nation, and after
telling how we could knock the spots oft various na
tions, in a moment of sublimated enthusiasm he said:
"We can whip any nation in the world except Eng
land, and England is our best friend."
It may be that the Senator relies upon a thrill so
thrilling that it will take no thought for these things,
but will thrill a hole right through the record and
stop st nothing.
No doubt it would make the circus season a failure
by its competition, and would reduce attendance at
county fairs below the premium-paying point. There
are some things that would have to be forgotten,
however, or the splendor of the thrill will bleach.
While Bryan is making the anti-expansion section of
his widely known and justly celebrated speech
the crowd will have to forget that Dewey
signed the report of the first Philippine Com
mission and advocated nailing the flag to
the Philippines with a big, big nail. The people who
do the thrilling will also have to forget that the Vice
President has the casting vote in the Senate, and in
the event of a tie on the subject of nailing flags to
islands' would he vote for the hammer and the ten
penny, or for packing the flag in camphor and bring
ing it home again from a foreign shore?
RECENTLY one of the Bryan steering commit
tee â we believe it was either Senator Tillman
or Senator Jonesâ advocated the nomination of-
Admiral Dewey for the Vice Presidency, to run with
Bryan. He declared it would make a hurrah cam
paign from start to finish, with interest unabated
from ratification to inauguration. With his mind's
eye he gazed upon the resplendent spectacle, and,
rising to rhapsody, exclaimed: "Imagine it! Bryan
and Dewey touring the country from ocean to ocean;
both appearing on the car platform, and Bryan thrill
ing the people with his oratory, while his hand rested
on the shoulder of the hero. of Manila Bay."
FROA\ THE CAR PLATFORM.
Our season for forest fires has not yet come, but
in due time it will be here. Then we shall have again
as we have had for years past fire after fire sweep
ing over thousands of acres, and the people beyond
our borders will be as indifferent to them as we have
been to the fires in Pennsylvania. It is clear that
nothing but a persistent agitation, a campaign of in
struction carried on continuously for. a long time to
come, will convince the American people that they
have no right to boast themselves of economy and
thrift, and hardly any right to call themselves civil
ized, until they devise some means of putting a stop
to the yearly waste of these destructive conflagrations:
It is probable the fires we have noted have cost Penn
sylvania more than would have been required to pay
for protecting the forests of the whole. State for a
5-ear. California will doubtless have almost as dis
astrous an experience before the next rainy season
begins. When will we learn wisdom from these
lessons?
We have here, therefore, a striking illustration of the
carelessness and indifference of the American people
to one of the most serious evils that "affect the coun
try. There is hardly any sort of occurrence to which
more attention and study- should be given than to
these fires, for the destruction of our woods means
not only a present monetary loss, but it means a
menace to the welfare of future generations.

safa to Bay that barely a <Jay will pass
without one or mere craft getting away
for the new El Dorado.
Over a thousand gold hunters left hero
yesterday. The first vessel to get away
was the ex-traneport Ohio. She was
crowded with passengers and there was
hardly standing room on Steuart-s=treet
wharf for an hour before the steamer
pulled Into the etream. Ail sorts and con
ditions of men and not a few women were
there. The man who carried a few thou
eands In his pocket! to invest in the mines
was "hail feilow well met" with the man
whose whole fortune consisted of his
knapeack. Tet the roan with the knap
sack had as many friends down to fee
him away as tbe man with the small for
tune ln his pockets, while the farewell
to the man with the knape&ck waa ln
nearly Â©very instance most pathetic. To
the roan with "the sack" It was "Well,
food-by. old man. I hopÂ« you'll comÂ«
ack with a million." Around the neck
cf the men with the knapsack hung
Scenes at the Sailing of the Nome Fleet.
women and children and in nearly every
Instance It was "Come back safe. Never
mind the money."
The Alaska Commercial Company's
steamer Rainier was supposed to be the
first to get away, but It was hours after
her advertised sailing time before she
could make a start. The vessel was
splendidly stowed and everything was In
'"apple pie order" at noon, but during
the afternoon considerable freight came
down and It had to be got aboard. Be
sides her general cargo the Rainier takes
over thirty head of horses, all of which
will be worth their weight in'gDld at
Nome. The accommodation on the smart
little steamer Is limited, but still she man
aged to take away about a hundred pas
sengers.
Among those who went away on the Rai
nier were Tom Eager and Joe Hocker,
l-*nited States Inspectors of Customs. Joe
and Tom are not In search of a fortune
at Nome nor are they going there for their
health. Eoth of them assert that they are
going north on their own private business,
but the chances are that there will be
pome arrests for smuggling and a claim
against the owners of British vessels for
landing merchandise at an American port
without a permit after the arrival of
the two Inspectors in Anvil City.
Harry Johnston, an ex-Custom-house
broker, also went north on the Rainier.
Harry has some good claims at Nome and
all his friends hope he will make a good
EtaJce. The Merry brothers. F. C. Bell.
C. K. Malcom and S. Moody were aleo
among those who left for the gold fields.
The last of the fleet to get away was
the Luella from Mission-street wharf. Her
limit was about a hundred passengers and
around abotot sailing- time men were offer
ing $150 and $300 for a chance to get away
on her. Not a man could be found who
would give up his berth for three times
, wha t it cost him, so the gold hunters
left behind had to seek transportation
somewhere else. Every vessel on the berth
is crowded to her full capacity and the
chances are that thousands of people who
want to reach Nome this season will be
unable to do so because there are not
enough ships to carry them.
Water Front Notes.
The horse transport Flintshire sailed
yesterday for Manila. She carried a large
cargo of commissary supplies, fifty mules
and four horses for General MacArthur
t>he will be followed at noon to-day by the
transport Logan. The latter vessel will
also carry a large cargo of supplies and
about 600 recruits, besides a number of
surgeons and nurses.
The Italian bark PrecursorÂ© has sailed
at last for Europe with a cargo of lum
ber. The vessel has been ln the stream
for nearly five weeks. As the captain
could not pay his bills the creditors would
not let the vessel leave. The captain
made the mistake of sending all his freight
money home to Italy and when his bills
came ln he had not a cent with which to
meet them. The agents of the vessel had
to advance the money ln order to get the
PrecurBore away.
There Is still no news from the overdue
Dominion and reinsurance men are look
tng askance at the risk. The utory that
Captain Jarneberg sold -the old bark In
Sydney.-N. 8. W., about four years ago
and never accounted for -the money is de

who examined the records ln Sydney says
that after court and other expenses were
paid there was not enough left to pay
Captain Jarneberg his wages and instead
of mm owing: the ship money the owners
are Indebted to him for a month's pay, ,

File Suit to EDj'oin Commis
sion From Holding
Examinations.
Claim That the Charter Provision
Creating the Board Is Unconsti
tutional and Interferes With
Public Business.
Another attack was made yesterday on
the leg-allty of the Civil Service Commis
sion. Suit was filed by A. C. Bauer
against John E. Qulnn, P. H. McCarthy
and J. Richard Freud, who constitute the
commission, to restrain them from "pro
ceeding Â¦with further competitive exami
nations or from in "any way Interfering
with the public business of any office or
department of the city and county, or
with the public acts or Incumbency of any
officer therein employed."
Although the suit will directly affect all
employes over whom the commission now
assumes authority, it was filed for the
purpose of protecting those employes in
the County Clerk's office whom the com
mission Is preparing to remove from of
fice.
After dealing with the manner of the
appointment of the members of the com
mission by Mayor Phelan. direct attack
is made in the complaint on the constitu
tionality of that body. It is alleged that
the Commissioners threaten, and unless
restrained will proceed, to molest, harass,
annoy and disturb certain copyists who
are the lawful and actual Incumbents ln
that capacity in the office of the County
Clerk and to assail, question and bring
Into dispute and Uncertainty the validity
of the public acts of the incumbents, af
fecting the liberty and property of the
citizens of this city and county. On the
assertion that such acts would be Illegal
and in violation of the constitution, and If
allowed to proceed the Commissioners
would cause Illegal charges to be made
apalnst the treasury, a perpetual Injunc
tion, forever restraining the board Irom
further action, is demanded.

HORSESHDERS TO
BE DEPRIVED Of
PRIVATE SNAPS
Judge Cook ordered a writ of mandate
Issued yesterday compelling the Board of.
Fire Commissioners to advertise for bids
for shoeing the department's horses and
to award contracts for the same to the
lowest bidder. The Judge found author
ity for the Issuance of the order in ques
tion in the charter, -which provides that
all contracts for supplies must be award
ed upon bids duly advertised for and not
upon nrivate agreements. In the opin
ion of the court "horseshoeing" is in
cluded in the word "supplies." and hence
must be included in the- advertisements
for bids. -
Several weeks- ago Frank Frisbee ap
plied for a writ of mandate to compel the
board to advertise for bids. The Com
missioners contended that the interests
of the department could be best sub
served by employing horseshoers by the
month, as many different kinds of shoes
and shoeing are required 1 , which would
make it very difficult to frame an adver
tisement calling for Â¦ competitive bids.
Judge Cook, however, decided that this
objection was untenable.
"All supplies, must be advertised for,"
pays the court. "The commission may be
of the opinion that It would be wise to
adopt other methods, but it cannot go be
yond the charter. That Instrument fixes
the powers of the commission absolutely.
It provides lor competition in the fur
nishing of supplies, and this provision
must be followed. Private contracts
made ln opposition thereto are void."
Fire Department Work Must
Be Awarded to the
Lowest Bidder.

WASHINGTON, May 15.â The Cuban
postal frauds was practically the only
subject of discussion at to-day's Cabinet
meeting. No late news has been received
which throws any additional light on the
situation and It is not expected that any
thing conclusive will be known until the
experts now on their" way to* Havana
have concluded their investigation and
made a report.
The suspension of Postmaster Thompson
was a great surprise to the President and
to tho members of. the Cabinet, none of
whom believe that he is guilty in tha
least. It la assumed that General "Wood
had come to the conclusion that until tho
matter of these frauds had been thorough
ly investigated It -would bÂ« best to tem
porarily suspend all of the officials who
were In positions where they might have
had knowledge, guilty or otherwise, of
what was going on.
Mr. . Thompson, it Is said, has been
prominently connected with thÂ© Indianap
olis postofnee for many years arid was
selected as Postmaster at Havana be
cause of his knowledge of the business
and his unquestioned integrity. Ho was
not a candidate for the place -and knew
nothing of the President's Intentions until
the office was tendered him with the ur
gent request that he accept it. Members
of the Cabinet are not Inclined to think
that there was any widespread conspiracy
to defraud, but nevertheless It is the pur
pose of the Government to sift the mat
ter to the bottom.
News, of the tjuspension of Postmaster
Thompson was received by Postmaster
General Smith and by him reported to the
Cabinet to-day. It was evident from Gen
eral "Wood's telegram that irregularities
at least, had not been found in Postmas
ter Thompson's accounts.
The War Department has temporarily
ceased the prosecution of the investiga
tion here, for, with the transfer of the
extradition proceedings, to the District
Attorney's offlco In New York, and of the
detailed examination of the books to Ha
vana, where It In to be thoroughly prose
cuted by the postofflce inspectors, there is
nothing further to be done here at pres
ent.
The Cabinet also discussed the reception
to be accorded the Boer delegation which
has Just arrived In this country. The de
cision was to make no unnecessary tech
nical points aealnst the -delegates, but to
treat them with as much liberality as
is possible without a breach of the diplo
matic proprieties. Tf they Â¦ have anv
credentials the delegates will be afforded
an opportunity to present them to the
State Department. It is said there is a
precedent for this line of action.- But as
It Is undoubtedly the administration's be
lief that this particular delegation does
not come in a diplomatic capacity, the
problem connected with , their reception I Is
considerably simplified' and officials will
not be called upon to extend any form of
recognition of the independence - of - the
Boer republic which might be regarded as
an act of Interference In the dispute
which led to the existing war.

PHILADELPHIA, May 15.-A11 records
in the broad Jump have been broken by
Captain Krenzlein of the Pennsylvania
University team. He cleared yesterday In
practice 24 feet Sft Inches. The jump can
not stand as a record, as it was not made
in a contest. Tho world's record is now
held by Prinztein of Syracuse University,
who cleared 24 feet 7*4 Inches here April

The latest bulletin issued by the boxing
magnates is to the effect that the bout
between Al Neill and Jack Moffltt will take
place In Woodward's Pavilion on the last
day of this month under the auspices of
the Columbia Athletic Club. Up to tho
last moment the officials of the National
Athletic Club thought the bout, which is
a promising one from the promoters' point
of view, would come to them. Alottltt and
his manager traveled "West on tickets su
pllcd by the club and both expressed a de
sire to have the fight held under its pat
ronage.
When the parties at Interest met yester
day the representatives of the boxers In
sisted that tho fight should take place on
or before June 1. The National Club rep
resentatives asked that a date between
the 7th and 14th of June be named.
Charles Newman agreed to deposit 75OUO
as a guarantee that the tight wquld take
place between those dates. The boxers
were obdurate, claiming a postponement
would lnterefere with other engagements.
They went at once to the Columbia Club
and signed to fight twenty rounds on the
31st inst for CO per cent of the gate re
ceipts. They did not require any guar
antee from the club that the match would
be brought off. .
Motfltt went at once to the Seal Rock
House on the ocean beach and settled
down to training with Frank Rafael as
boxing partner. Neill has spent some
weeks at the cpring3 near Vallejo. but
will resume practice at his old quarters,

MOFFITT FIGHT
At Morris Park.
LOUISVILLE, May 15.â With John
Bright, at 6 to 1 In thÂ© betting, winning
the mile and fifty yards handicap in
wcrld'6 record time, and with Juanetta
winning handily after being backed down
from 60 to 1 to 12 to 1. there was a great
deal doing at Churchill Downs this after
noon. There was a email-sized killing
made on Juanetta In the fifth race. All
the pikers had the tip and they got down
with tholr twos and fives In such haste
and so plentifully that the 60 to 1 chalked
up at the opening was quickly lowered to
30 and finally to 12. The mare Justified
the confidence of her backers by winning
handily in 1:14Â»4. There was a cheer that
nearly" took the roof off the grand stand
when it was seen that she would win. It
is said that the tip was sent out to every
poolroom in the country.
The chief event of the card was the
free handicap at a mile and fifty yards,
in which Bangle, John Bright, Batten.
Salvarse and Arthur Behan tried conclu
sions. The rexe proved to be one of the
prettiest of the meeting. Batten set out
to miike the pace and kept in front until
the half was reached. Here he was
Joined by Bangle, who soon forged to the
front, John Bright running easily in
fourth place close up. They reached the
head of the stretch going like steam en
pines and the mile was run in the remark
ably fast time of 1:S3 2-C.
The pace began to tell on Batten and
Bangle, though they kept gamely at it.
In the stretch Winkfield. with a well
timed rush, brought John Bright to the
front and won by a length and a half in
1:4214. which equals the world's record for
the "distance, which was established by
Florenzo in Chicago on July 6, 1&9S. John
Bright's performance to-day was much
more creditable, because he carried 122
pounds, while Florenzo only had up 93

COURSE OF LECTURES
BY A FAMOUS ORATOR
Society, which has been fortunate in se
curing dates from this celebrated man.
The course of lectures -is as follows:
"Story of My Conversion." Monday, May
21; "Cardinal Newman," Wednesday. May
23; "The Novel," Friday, May 25; "The
Theater," Tuesday, May 29; "America* a
Debt to the Catholic Church," Thursday,
May 81.
Mr. Adams' lecture on his conversion
should be of especial Interest to those who
make any study of matters religious. He
will tell the reasons that caused him to
forsake the Protestant for the Catholio
faith and will, of course, dwell upon their
different foundations.
Mr. Adams is a learned churchman- He
wns pastor o.f one of the most cultured
congregations in Baltimore before he be
came a Catholic He was editor of a lead-
Ing religious and literary magazine, but
his engagements on the lecture platform
(for which he was much sought) caused
him to give up this work. He has been
the center of attraction at the annual
sessions of the Catholic summer school
and the winter school at Now Orleans.
Those who attend these lectures will
certainly be well rewarded, and no one
who appreciates ripe scholarship, rare
culture and brilliant oratory will miss
Season tickets admitting holders to all
the lectures may be obtained at the
headquarters of the Catholic Truth So
ciety, room 37, Flood building.
Mr. Adams will lecture in Sacramento
June 5, at Stockton June 7 and at Oak
land and San Jose later.

prop and mainstay of the building at 302
California street. The wall In question
appears to be In an experimental stage
of vegetation, for thus far only one tiny
spot Is productive, and from It sprouts
a hardy fern, the fronds of which are
fully eighteen Inches long. -The fern is of
thÂ« common flve-flnger variety, luxuriant
and of a brilliant green, having all the
appearance . of a well nourished plant

There is no crack In, the wall around or
near the roots of the fern. The plant
seems to spring right out the brick Just
a little below the roof of the building:.
For the past few days the "rubber

been kept In splendid practice, and if the
fern continues to flourish ; it is estimated
by those competent to Judge the percent
age of elongated peninsulas will increase
to an alarming extent. 'Although all the
neighborhood has been on to the fern
for some time, the man who occupies the
room over whose window the fern flour
ishes was ignorant of its being. 'When
he was first questioned about the growth
he was consumed with an awful fear.
'.'Don't tell me," he cried, "that there
Is. grass growing, out of my place," and
then he craned his neck out bf the win
dow. .When he' saw the luxuriant growth
he; appeared reassured.
"This Is a wonderful place," he said,
and then he asked his typewriter to
make a tour of inspection on the roof.
"I'm prepared for anything now," he ex
plained, "and who knows what this build
ing is Capable of? Why, there may be
Belgian hares on the roof."
The building with the fertile wall is one
of the bunch of houses on California
street that belongs to the Parrott estate.

"Lyrical Ballads" of 1798, is perhaps the
most remarkable volume of poetry the
eighteenth century produced;- certainly it
is the most important in its after effects.
Both Scott and Byron drew their inspira
tion from the new music of "Chrlstabel."
To no poet of his age do we owe a deeper
debt, not only for what he did, but 'for
what he caused others to do.
.So much has been written on Words
worth .that it seems a hopeless task to
take up the tale and say anything new.
From Coleridge and De Quincey to Ar
nold and Swinburne the foremost Eng
lish critics have delighted to dwell upon
his verse, to point out its merits and de
fects, to examine the theory of poetry
upon which it is based and to expound
the philosophy which It contains. And
the predilection with which criticism has
turned to Wordsworth has its good and
sufficient reasons. For three-quarters of
a century ho has been the most profound
and stimulating influence in English
poetry and has done more than any mod
ern poet to inform and strengthen Eng
lish life. For his poetry has a quality,
"fortifying and ennobling," that Is at
once unique and priceless. He was him
self well aware of this. "Trouble not
yourself," he wrote to a friend lament
ing the savage criticism which for the
moment cheaked the sale of his poems;
"trouble not yourself â¢ upon their present
reception: of what moment Is that com
pared with what I trust is their destiny?
â to console the afflicted: to add sunshine
to daylight by making the happy hap-
pier; to teach the young and gracious of
every age to see. to think, to feel, and
therefore to become more actively virtu
ous." The superb self-confidence which
Inspired these words has been amply Jus
tified and it la well worth our while to
make an effort to discover the reason of
Wordsworth's influence and the sources
of his power.
Note^ â This study will be continued to
morrow. - >-Â£jj
New Ritual Adoptedâ The Officers for
Next Term Yet to Be ,
Elected.
At yesterday's session of the Supreme
Grand Circle of the Companions of the
Forest, A. O.- F., all the business was dis
posed of except the election of officers,
which was made the special order for 10
o'clock this morning.
The committee on written and unwritten
work presented a lengthy report which in
volved a number of minor changes in the
floor work and in the charges by the offi
cers of the subordinate circles. This re
port was adopted as presented. New rit
uals will be printed and sent to the cir
cles in exchange for the old ones without
cost to the circles.
The report of the committee on the state
of the order was a flattering one. It
showed that the Supreme Grand Circle is
in a healthy condition, having paid all de
mands against it and having enough on
hand to meet the expenses of the conven
tion. The report commends that portion
of the address of the supreme grand chief
companion which alludes to the great
harmony existing between the members
of the Ancient Order of Foresters and the
members of the Companions of the Forest-
In tho evening there was a banquet to
the officers and delegates In a Stockton
street dining-room, at which there were
present about seventy-five. John Falco
ner, P. S. G. C. C, was the toast-mas
ter. There was no programme of toasts,
but a large number of those who were at
the table were called upon to "make a few
remarks."
COMPANIONS OF FOREST
WILL ADJOURN TO-DAY
ROBERT BURNS.
erhood of man as a dogma of revealed
religion: he translated, as has been well
said, the gospel of Rousseau Into the
gospel. of St. Paul. He declared that the
cause of liberty was the cause of man.
prophesied that only reform could avert
revolution in England, and exulted in the
approaching fall of royal prisons, "the
abode of broken hearts." No wonder
that Dr. Franklin, that American em
bodiment of the revolutionary spirit,
found in the works of Cowper "something
so new in the manner" and so Just in the
sentiments" that he read "the whole with
pleasure and some of the pieces more
than once."
Burns, liko Cowper. is a poet of the
revolution, but he has none of Cowper's
calm and philosophic reverence of lib
erty. -He is a passionate democrat. . The
hardships- of his own life fired him with
bitter indignation against the injustice
of the prevailing social system, and he
looked to the ultimate triumph of revo
lutionary principles for the redress of
this injustice.
It's "coming yet, for a* that.
That man to man. the world o'er.
Shall brothers be for a' that.
Had Burns lived in France he would
have been a poet of the barricades. In
1792, the very year of the September mas
sacres, he sent a pair of guns seized from
a smuggler as a personal gift to the
French convention. At a public dinner he
proposed the tqast of "the last verse of
the last chapter of the last book of
Kings." Naturally enough, considering the
circumstances of his life. Burns was not
always consistent In his politics. The fear
of losing his place in the excise drew from
him a loud declaration of his attachment
to the British constitution. The threat
of French invasion called out one of the
finest of his patriotic sungs, but even In
this outburst he makes no secret of bis
democratic principles. . â¢ .
Who will not sins: God save the kins.
Shall hang as high's the steeple;
But .while we sing God cave the kin?.
We'll ne'er forget the people.
One of the most striking characteristics
of the poetry of Burns is his passionate
love of nature. In this he is the true,
though perhaps unconscious, disciple of
Rousseau and the forerunner of Words
worth. "I never hear the loud solitary
whistle of the curlew in a summer noon,"
he writes to a friend, "or the wild mix-
Ing cadence of a troop of gray plover In
an autumnal morning without feeling an
elevation of soul like the ''enthusiasm of
devotion or poetry." This enthusiasm for
nature, a reaction from the urban and ar
tificial life of the eighteenth century, Is
one of the chief marks of the revolution
ary spirit in poetry. It had appeared al
ready in Cowper. but in Burns we have a
warmth of sympathy which da far in ad
vance of the English poet's attitude of
somewhat patronizing admiration. When
Burns sees the frightened mouse flying
before his plowshare he feels for It as a
"poor earth-born companion, a fellow mor
tal." "The Twa Dogs"* are as human as
Tarn o' Shanter and his crony. In the
fate of the mountain daisy the poet sees
an omen of his own. All nature, in fact,
is regarded by Burns as sharing. in the
feelings of humanity.
Even more intense and passionate was
his love for mankind. Burns was no
stricken deer that had left the herd, but
a living, loving, sinning and suffering man
such as English poetry had not known
since Shakespeare. He sings of what he
has seen and felt, the simple piety and
homely joys of "The Cotter's Saturday
Night," the laughing fun of "Halloween '
and the "Holy Fair, the rollicking good
fellowship inspired by John Barleycorn,
above all of love in all its phases, re
jected, despairing, triumphant and remin
iscent. Love poetry, silent in England
since the close ot the Elizabethan era.
sprang into glorious life in the songs of
this Scotch peasant. For there was in
Burns a quality of sentiment that Invest
ed even the basest passion with those rap
tures of fire and air that mark our older
poets. And even finer than these rap
tures is the tenderness of his sympathy
for sinning and suffering humanity. Not
Ignorant of evil, he knew how to pity; and
in sharp contrast with the preachers and
satirists of his century he drew over the
world the broad mantle of human charity.
But perhaps the characteristic which
most distinctly marks Burns as the poet
of the revolution is his spirit of rebellion
against the established order of things.
It is no calm plea for reform that we hear
in his poems, but a note of angry revolt,
springing from a sense of personal wrong
and' degenerating at times Into a selfish
license.

Poets of Revolution and Reaction.
Southey, Coleridge and Wordsworth
form a-triad of poets closely connected in
their, lives and work. Alike subject to the
early influences of the revolution, they
alike reacted against it when the lust of
conquest supplanted the love of liberty.
.Southey .may be dismissed In a - few
words. As, a. poet ; he is dead. -.'His; ten
volumes of verse, ponderous epics and lu
dicrous 'ballads Â«%s relegated to the dust
of the. upper shelves. s A mere handful of
meditative poems survives to fill a corner
in the anthologies, and if he had not been
the friend of Wordsworth and Coleridge
his personality would be as vague, to us

GOLDEN AGES OF" LITERATURE.
Henceforth Coleridge ranked among th*
conservatives. Ho never became a tory
reactionist, like Southey. But he aban
doned poetry and set himself to interpret
rather than to alter the Institutions, polit
ical and religious, of his country. Of his
influence over the later thought of Eng
land this is not the place to speak. It is
enough to say that he became the spirit
ual father of nineteenth century intellect
ual liberalism, and in the last years of his
life his home at Hlghgate was as an or
acle where the noblest minds of his coun
try repaired for inspiration.
It Is not possible to overestimate the
rank of Coleridge In English literature.
He recreated the ode, the ballad, and tho
metrical romance. He quickened the
stronger but more slowly moving genius
of Wordsworth, and their Joint work, the
as that of any eighteenth-century lau
reate. Perhaps his surest title to immor
tality is found in the undying scorn which,
Byron poured out upon him in the "Vision
of Judgment." Here Southey appears as
the Epic Renegade who
Had written praises of a reclcide:
And written pratse9 of all kings whatÂ»v.Â»r;
He h.id written for republics far and wide.
,-And then against them bitterer than ever.
let Southey was never the unprincipled
turncoat these lines imply. He had hon
estly espoused the principles of the-revolu
tion and as honestly recoiled from the ex
cesses of the reign of terror. But there
was something hard, narrow and Philis
tlnic about Snuthey's later work that par
ticularly exposed him to the onslaught of
Byron. His lauded "Ode During thÂ« Ne
gotiations for Peace" is in substance a
savage, cry for the blood of Napoleon, ami
in his "Vision of Judgment. a poem
whose dullness is equaled only by its un
conscious profanity, he consigns \Vilk<>3
and Junlus to hell because in life they had
dared to oppose that great and good King.
George III. But enough of Southey.
Samuel Taylor Coleridge Is the very an
tipodes of Southey. A far profounder
thinker and loftier poet, he was lament
ably inferior as a man. But his rank aa
a poet is little disturbed by his moral fail
ings, although the quantity of his poetic
production was undoubtedly lessened.
With a few exceptions all his verso was
written in the last decade of the century.
and it could be included in a narrow com
fiass. But it contains infinite, riches In a
Ittle room. He broke away as no one
yet had ventured to do from all the tradi
tions of the century. The exaltation of hl3
odes, the mystery in simplicity of the
"Ancient Mariner." the haunting music of
"Chrlstabel"â all these are absolutely new.
Coleridge was inspired above his fellows
by the spirit of the revolution. As a
schoolboy he exulted in the fall of tho
Bastile. At Cambridge he was the asso
ciate of Frend, who was expelled for unl
tarlanism and sedition. Against Pitt,
whom he regarded as tho representative
of the anti-revolutionary spirit, he launch
ed the dreadful invective of "Fire, Famine
and Slaughter." His finest burst of revo
lutionary feeling Is found In the "Ode to
tho Departing Year"â 1797. But the next
year saw a complete change. Already
sickened by the massacres of the Terror,
ne shrank In horror from the French
assault on the liberties of Switzerland,
and the greatest of his odes â "France" â
sings his formal recantation of revolution
ary principles.
THE POETRY OF AN. AGE OF REVOLUTION.
XXn. GOLDEN AGE OF ENGLISH
POETBY. -
BY 'THOMAS MARC PARROTT; PH,D.
The poetry of the- age of Wordsworth
and Byron Is the poetry of an age of rev
olution. It does , riot. "Â»lo. be sure,; spring
directly from the political upheaval In
France, hut It Is closely associated with
It, a product of the same great movement
for -liberty of thought and action. With
one great exception, the poets of the age
take sides for or against. In certain cases
both for and against, this movement, and
it is by their common interest in the rev
olution and their varying attitude to its
successive phases that poets so dissimi
lar in form and spirit as Cowper and
Scott. Burns and Shelley, Byron and
Coleridge, are mutually related. And a
study of their work from this point of
view lends a unity otherwise Impossible
of attainment to one of the most brlllant
ages of English literature.
Forerunners â Cowper and Burns.
The new note Is first struck In "Table
Talk" and its companion poems in 17S2.
Cowper owed little or nothing to the poets
of the preceding generation. His revolt
against the accepted conventionalities of
his time, his close observation of nature,
his delight In the simple human affec
tions, all mark him aa the poet of a new
day. And in politics, as in literature,
Cowper has something of the revolution
ary spirit. The most devout of Chris
tians, he accepted the idea of the broth-
The San 'Francisco Credit Men's Asso
ciation was .organized yesterday at' a
meeting held In the rooms of the . San
Francisco Board of Trade. There were
about twenty present. The credit men
are those who determine what customers
of a house, are entitled to credit, and
watch that phase of the business as a
specialty.
The preliminary work was done by a
committee of which Morris Feintuch was
chairman. Mr. Feintuch presided and
spoke of the advantages of the proposed
organization. The National Credit Men's
Association, he said, had about 3500 mem
bers. It had brought about some legisla
tion of value to the business community.
In some States laws had been passed pre
venting the sale of stocks of goods In bulk
without notice to the creditors. The mer
cantile agency work had been Improved
by the influence of the National Associa
tion. One agency had made known that
83 to 84 per cent of statements were now
signed. Formerly the limit was 26 per
cent.
Mr. Felntuch's remarks proved to be
convincing and the organization was
speedily formed. The ! purposes, as set
forth in the constitution and by-laws, are
as follows:
This association Is organized for protective
as well as educational purposes; to promote
and combine the Intelligence of members for
protection against Imposition, injustice and
fraud; to agitate and effect changes in the
collection and bankruptcy laws or thlÂ» and
other States and the protection of creditors
agatnst abuses now prevalent; to bring about
improvements and Rreater similarity In busi
ness methods,' customs and usages of trade
and to establish closer ties of business asso
ciation among the members; to improve the ex
isting methods of the diffusion of Information,
and for the collection and dissemination of
data relative to the subject of credits.
The by-laws provide that the board of
directors shall act in harmony with the
National Credit Men's Association.
The following named were elected di
rectors: T. J. Parsons of the Del Monte
Milling Company, J. J. Schutz of Haas
Brothers, M. Feintuch of the Wer
theimer Company; G. Brenner of L.
& O. Brenner. S. W. Fuller of Hay

There was a brief, adjourned meeting of

the purpose of giving the Attorney Gen

the commission if he desired to do so
after receiving its request to proceed

Overcharged for Jail Supplies.
Sheriff Lackmann forwarded a commu
nication to the Board of Supervisors yes
terday In which he complains that the
city has ' been overcharged by James
Snook & Co., the contractors for jail sup
plies. For the months of January, Feb
ruary and March' the Sheriff' says that
$984 IS is due the city. The discrepancies
occur on account of tho difference of opin

Mrs. Davis made a speech urging mem-
Iktp to lnrrease their efforts and spend
pome of their time at the seaside and

Yesterday was memorial day in the or
der of Native Daughters of the Golden

the Grand Parlor adopted several years
ago.
Each of the thirteen local parlors had
representatives visit the several cemete
ries where the dead of the order are at

and place 1 wreaths of immortelles on the
headstones In tender remembrance of the
time when in life those who have passed
away were worthy .sisters.
La Estrella Parlor No. 89 held special
service last night in the Shasta Hall of

three of the members who passed to the
great beyond during the past year. These
were Mrs. T. foster, Mrs. Lillian A. Car

named was the founder of the parlor.
There were no emblems cf mourning in
the hall, hut the altar and rfhe several
stations wore covered with beautiful flow
ers, while In front of the station of the
president were the three chairs that were
left vacant by the members namt-d.
These were each entwined with garland3
of flowers and between them was an easel
draped with the American flag. The of
ficers and members of the parlor entereJ
the hall from an anteroom and marched
around while an orchestra played ' Cho
pin's funeral march. In passing the va
cant chair each deposited roses. Miss Ju

remarks upon the beautiful custom of
honoring the memories of the dead, after
which the secretary called the roll, the

?
<tj\ r? Y testimony on the stand in Judge Troutt's court as to Senator Fair
|w\\ Introducing me to Mrs. Craven as his wife was correct and I would
jl M Umake the same statement again. Senator Fair's requesting me to
keep It a secret was also correct. My motives in making the state
ments were the purest, for I had a desire to see Mrs: Craven get a portion of
the property, as I believe she is entitled to it; but whether she ever became
Senator Fair's wife or not I do not, know.
"I do not believe that she ever did, for Senator Fair told me afterward
that she was not his wife nor did he ever intend to marry her, but said she
was trying to compel him to and Insisted that she be introduced as his wife,
which I believe she was to others besides myself.
"He said he was in trouble with her and wanted to set rid of her and
asked me to go to her and seej what kind of a settlement I could get, which I
at first agreed to but afterward declined to do. â¢
"He told me^he had given her money with a lavish hand, but she spent It
as fast as she received it and he should stop unless he could get a settle
ment with her. I advised him to settle with her and get out of the trouble
and I have every reason to believe that negotiations were opened up for that
purpose but at his death had not been. consummated. Hence she now seeks
to establish herself as his wife and share in the property, which 1" still think
she is entitled to'and would have got had the Senator lived a few months
longer.
"I make this statement because I have not been treated right by Mrs.
Craven and her lawyers, who agreed to see that I was protected, which they
have made no attempt to do. They have allowed the opposition to ridicule mo
in a shameful manner and put men of disrepute on the stand to prove that I
had testified falsely. This statement is composed of facts and I make it in
self-defense, that the public may know why and how I came into the Cra
ven-Fair case. The public may Judge who the sinners and perjurers are.
t Â¦:. "H. N. BRYANT."
noon. Friday W. M. Pierson will argue
from 9 to 12 in the forenoon and Lafe
Pence will make the closing argument
from 1:30 to 4:30 in the afternoon.
Governor' Budd opened yesterday morn
ing's session of the trial by offering on
the part of the Fair heirs the judgment
roll In the suit on the deeds which Judge
Slack held void ajid the Judgment regard*
Ing the trust will. Objection was made by
Lafe Pence and sustained.
Attorney Walter H. Linforth, ex-Collec
tor John H. Wise and John \V. Nye, real
estate dealer at 314 Montgomery street,
testified in rebuttal that Lee D. Craig's
reputation was good. Â¦Â»
"Didn't you meet Oscar Sutro last
March and tell him you thought Craig
was lying in this case?" asked Attorney
Pierson.
"On the contrary," replied the witness,
"Sutro asked me if I would no't swear I
wouldn't believe Craig under oath, and I
told him I'd believe him, oath or no
oath."
Frank D. Webb, salesman for Murphy,
Grant & Co.. testified that he met Mrs.
Craven on Kearny street May 23. 1S92,
walked with her to her home, *23 Sutter
street, and that Senator Fair opened the
door for them. He saw her again the
next day at her home.
"You are a captain, are you not?"
asked Attorney Pierson. while engaged In
finding out all about the witness.
"I gave my name as plain Frank D.
Webb." replied the witness. "I've quit
the military entirely."
"If he's honestly trying to live down
his past give him a chance,", said Lafe
Pence, and a laugh enlivened the dryness
of the proceedings. ...
? John Falconer, grand secretary of^the
Foresters, testified that Justice Simpton
told him in 1896 that Senator Fair and
Mrs. Craven were married.
Mrs. Elizabeth Roy, formerly secretary
of the Companions of the Forest, was
recalled for cross-examination. She ac
knowledged having been arrested for
petty larceny through her connection
with a penny purchasing agency, but said
she was acquitted and that she paid $750
back to subscribers, pledging her Jewels
to help raise the money.
Attorney Pierson was called to the
stand by Mrs. Craven-Fair's counsel and
asked by Attorney Lafe Pence:
"Are you willing to produce the diary
of 1892?"
"We found none save the office diary
of Bresse & Angus," Mr. Pierson re
plied.
"Are you willing to spend two or three
hours searching with us down there in
the morning?" asked Pence.
"No. I'm not," was the reply.
"Are you willing to tell us where you
found that diary Introduced yesterday?"
"No, I'm not."
"Then, willing or unwilling, I. ask you
to tell." .
Mr. McEnerhey objected, and during
the argument that followed Pence spoke
of the rifled trunk at the Cliff House.
Mr. Pierson finally stated that the diary

"How Witness Changes
Import of Testimony He
Gave for Mrs. Craven by
Adding More to It.
He Declares Senator Fair
Told Him He Was Not
Married to Mrs/Craven
and She Wanted Money.
ANOTHER of Mrs. Craven-Falr'a
star witnesses has fallen dovn and
tells a story that Injures Instead of
supports her rause. H. N. Bryant,
who has attaJned some notoriety as the
"hobo" witness, issued a signed confes
sion yesterday in which he charges that
the late James G. Fair told him that Mrs.
Craven was not his wife, but was trying
to force him to recognize her as such and
that it was Mrs. Craven's importunities
that made the Senator introduce her as
his wife.
This is? another sensation in a case that
has been full of them. Bryant's change
of base bears a strong similarity to the
recanting of Bylva and Simpton, who first
ma.de statements for Mrs; Craven and
then made directly contrary ones. Taken
In connection with the changes of these
two witnesses the confession of Bryant is
most important.
Bryant does not absolutely change the
testimony which he has already given up
on the stand, but he comes forward with
a statement that he did not tell all that he
knew, and while what he told was true,
what ho did not tell puts an entirely dif
ferent aspect upon the meaning conveyed
by his testimony.
Bryant's original testimony was given
on March 12 and 13, at which time he told
the court that he knew Senator Fair dur
ing his lifetime and that upon the occa
sion of a visit to the latter's office Mrs.
Craven made a call upon the Senator, dur
ing which there were some exciting words
between them. Then everything was
smoothed over and Senator Fair intro
duced Mrs. Craven to Bryant as his wife.
The story of Bryant stopped at this
point and ne was subjected to a rigid
cross-examination. In which he was pretty
badly handled and no small amount of
ridicule was poked at him. He was dub
bed "the hobo witness 1 ' and for several
days his testimony was attacked.
Bryant became angered at the way in
which his name and character were being
bandied about, and yesterday he made a
full confession to The Call as to his en
tire connection with the Craven-Fair
suits. He says that while Senator Fair
did introduce Mrs. Craven to him as his
wife upon that occasion the Senator also
told him that he was compelled to do so,
because Mrs. Craven was making him so
much trouble.
Bryant la now living at the Galindo Ho
tel In Oakland. It was at that place that
he made and signed a written confession.
"I am tired of this constant attack upon
my name and character," said Mr. Bry
ant, "and 1 am now determined to make a
full statement. What I have already
stated is absolutely true, but there are
some other things to be told. I have not
one word of my testimony already given
to change, but I have something to add to
Jt. They have been talking about my hav
ing committed perjury. That Is not so. I
told the truth, but merely refrained from
telling certain matters that I was re
quested to keep secret.
"I have not been properly protected by
the attorneys for Mrs. Craven. I offered
them my story because it might have been
of benefit to her and then they allowed
me to be attacked in the most shameful
manner. I am now determined to tell all,
which I have not done before." -
Bryant thea prepared and signed a
a statement explaining his connection
with the case.
EEALY POR ARGUMENT.
Craven-Fair Case Testimony Is Now
All Before the Court.
After days and weeks and months of
court proceedings, at times dreary and
monotonous from the dry, formal argu
ments of counsel, reading of documentary
evidence and taking of expert handwrit
ing testimony, at others scintillating with
and full of excitement from new and sen
sational testimony and replete with witty
repartee and heated altercations of oppos
ing counsel, the Craven-Fair case came to
an end yesterday in Judge Troutt's court
so far as evidence and testimony are con
cerned, leaving behind it a malodorous
trail, rank with the stench of corruption.
There remains now but the argument of
counsel. This will commence to-day and
close Friday. Charles J. Pence will open
for Mrs. Craven-Fair at 1:30 o'clock this
afternoon and close at 4:30. He will be

CATHEDRAL COUNCIL
TO GIVE AN OUTING
AMATURO SAID HIS
BRIBE WAS A GIFT
Trial of a Japanese Immigrant for
Offering Twenty-Five Dollars
to Inspector Geffeney.
Iavanasa Amaturo, a Japanese Immi
grant, was placed on trial yesterday In
the United States District Court, before
a jury, on the charge of having attempted
to bribe A. H. Geffeney. one of the United
States Immigration inspectors.
1 Inspectors Crawford and De la Torre
testified that they were on board the Do
ric on March 25, 1S39. and that they saw
the defendant hand Mr. Geffeney $25.. Mr.
Geffeney thereupon placed Amaturo un
der arrest. -
The defendant was represented by John
E. Qulnn and Edward Lande. When Am
aturo was placed on the witness stand for
the purpose of telling his story they asked
that Mr. Geffeney, the complaining wit
ness, act as interpreter of Japanese. To
this arrangement no objection was made.
Amaturo swore that Geffeney. called him
aside and asked:
"What can you do for me?"
Amaturo replied with cheerful laconlsm:
"Twenty-five dollars as a present.". He
swore also that he did not think there
was anything wrong in the making of a
gift to an official. It was a common thin*
In Oriental countries, he said.
The case will be argued before the jury
this morning.

NEW YORK. May 15.â Operations In the
Ftock market continued to be left largely to
yjrofessional hands to-day, the movement be
ing exceedingly irregular and confused all day.
Generally (--peaking it could be fairly said
that railroad stocks were firm to strong while
the industrials were weak. This distinction
v. as obvious at the opening of the market and
the day's tradinp tended rather to emphasize
It, except that the demoralizing tendencies
In the steel industrials ultimately affected the
whole lif-t and dragged back even the strongest
of the railroads. There was a. brief show of
strength after the opening by Federal Steel
and Steel and Wire, probably on covering of
thorts Rfiid en yesterday's break, but in the
late trading these stocks as weli as others of
the group fell to the lowest. The declines
rar.g< â¢! all the way from 1 to nearly 6 points,
the latter Tennessee Coal. There su no
definite news to account for the weakness, but
rumors were plentiful that dividends would
be reduced or passed and that further deep
cuts were pending in the price of the output
of the larpest competitor of the pteel com
pa.niÂ«-e nhiae stocks are dealt In on the Stock
Exchange. The declaration of a nrst dividend
on the common Etock of National Tube and
the reports of the reopening of sundry mills
had no effect in checking the decline. Among
:hf notable exceptions to the weakness In the
Industrial department were the group of New
York City stock*, including American Ice.
Consolidated Gas led In the rise of 5 points
and the local tractions responded. A meeting
of the directors of the American Sugar Refining
Company caused an uneasy demand from the
fhortt. which lifted the etock at one time 2*4.
In the railroad list Burlington continued In
good demand at an extreme advance of 1% in
eplte of denials of the rumored refunding
plan. The granger group and Western rail
rend stocks were most benefited In sympathy
and fhoÂ»fd good advances In eplte of reports
of declining traffic, both east and west bound.
There Â«Â»f faiÂ«i to be large buying for account
of an outstanding short Interest in the West
In the railroad list. The international depart
rner-t was helped by some buying for London
account, where price* rallied on easier money
and the encouraging war news. The relief to
the London money market afforded by the
receipts of Russian gold arouses the hope that
no immediate demand would be made on New
York by London lor gold. Thie was an In
fluence tn the day's strength in our stock mar
ket, although It Is expected that further ship
ments will be made to Parts by Thursday's
steamer. The statement of the April foreign
trade of the United States, disclosing a main
tenance of extraordinary favorable conditions
have elevated somewhat the evidences of con
tinued reaction in interior trade. The market
dosed heavy and 'unsettled by the break in
the ttÂ»l industrials, the railroad stocks hold
ing only a part of their gain.
EThe bond market was not active, but prices
were held well sustained. Total sales, nar
value, tl.075.0C0.

New York Stock Market.
CHICAGO, May 15.â Wheat opened easy, July
%c lower at 66HS66UC. Rains in the South
west were the burden of reports which caused
bearish feeling as It was figured that the
rain would produce a high rate of mortality
among the crop-damaging chinch bugs. While
these reports were still uppermost in the minds
of traders and they had plenty of time to
think about It, as trade was very dull, July
eased off to 6Cc. It did not get any lower,
however. One Kansas report said that too
much rain had fallen, whereat the market
steadied and traders recollected that Liver
pool cables were also in favor of a better
wheat price. The Northwest complained be
cause no rain had fallen and objected to the
weather map, which offered no relief. July
advanced to 66',-jc, but profit-taking and sym
pathy with corn caused it to ease off. The
close was firm, July a shade under yesterday
at 66'^c.
Corn was the chief sufferer In price on the
board. The excellent growing weather report
ed from nearly every section of the belt was
too much for the market and at one time
July was lc under yesterday's closing figure,
while the close showed only a slight recovery.
Liverpool was decidedly lower, which also had
a depressing effect. July left off \c under yes
terday at 36Hc.
Trade in the oats pit was light, but a good
cash demand held the market firm In spite of
the corn weakness. July closed a shade lower
at 21Ti@22c.
Provisions were firm for the greater part of
the day with some added activity and strength
near the end. Liverpool was higher for hog
products and prices at the yards firm. July
pork closed 5c higher, lard 7>Â£c higher and
rib* 2Â«405c U p.

NEW YORK. May 15.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The markets here were Irregular at the start
to-day, but they gradually improved and the
finish was quite careful on war news and
the tendency to discount the relief of Mafe
klng. Cheap money also helped funds. Ameri
cans began rather sanguine, but died out for
half an hour, then steadily strengthened until
the close. New York accepting the rise and
supporting the higher prices. The finish was at
the top. Business was decidedly brisker than
lately, even the public buying slightly. Tintos
rallied on Paris buying. Call money was very
easy, although treasury bills were paid for.
Gold to the amount of Â£5O0.CO0 came in from
Russia and Â£4C00 went out to South America.

Quests Forced to Jump Prom Win-

CHICAGO. May 16.â The Hotel Helene,

fire early this morningr. The conflagra
tion was very fierce and many of tho oc
cupants were forced to Jump from the
windows to escape the flames. Several
persons were severely injured and one or
two are thought to have been killed.
The building was a three-story structure,
containing 100 rooms, all of them being

Spirited Debate at the Metho
dist Conference in
umcago.
CHICAGO, May 15.â The general confer
ence of the Methodist Episcopal Church
voted to-day to increase by two Bishops
the board of general superintendents,
thus adopting the majority report of the
committee on episcopacy. This decision
was reached after one of the most excit
ing and eloquent debates of 'the quadren
nial conference, in which many of tha
most prominent members of the church
ln both hemispheres took part. The pro
ceedings were watched by a crowd that
taxed the capacity of the auditorium to
its utmost. The majority report, which
was considered ln the nature of a compro
mise, was adopted after two minority re
ports, one resolving that no Bishops be
elected, and another providing for the
election of four additional members of the
board of general superintendents, had
been voted down. The committee's report
favoring the election of a colored Bishop
was adopted by a large majority. One
ballot on the election of the two general
superintendents was taken Just before the
close of the session, but Its result will
not be announced until to-morrow.
Dr. John Handley of New Jersey intro
duced a resolution providing that the
British colors be given a place alongside
the stars and stripes on the platform. A
storm of "noes" went up from the dele
gates when the resolution was read by
Dr. Handley, who made a passionate ap
peal for the resolution. 1 He said:
"The British flag all over the world has
given to missionaries the protection which
encourages us in the great work of
preaching the Gospel.j It stands for the
open Bible ln every community. The
American and the Briton, have locked
arms to close the century with one united
effort to destroy the crescent and lift the
cross ln the East."
Dr. Handley's remarks apparently
turned the tide ln favor of the resolution,
but after several delegates, including W.
J. Welch of Wyoming, had spoken against
It, a motion to lay on the table, made by
Dr. S. P. Cadman of the New York Con
ference, prevailed.
Dr. Buckley read the report of the com
mittee on episcopacy on the effectiveness
of Bishops. It recommended that James
M. Thoburn, missionary Bishop of India,
and J. C. Hartsell, missionary Bishop of
Africa, bo declared effective, and that
William Taylor, missionary Bishop to
Africa, remain in his present position.
This was adopted.
The report favoring thÂ© election of a
Bishop of African descent was then read
and adopted. .
The question of additional. Bishops was
then argued at length and put to vote.'
The first vote was on the amendment pro
viding for four Bishops. This was over
whelmingly voteu down. The substitute
report opposing the election of any addi
tional Bishops was then defeated by a
standing vote of 419 noes to 224 ayes. The
majority report was carried by, about the
same vote; A motion by Dr. Buckley that
the convention proceed to the election of
Bishops was then adopted amid consider
able confusion.
Â¦ Under the rules adopted it requires . two
thirds of the vote cast to decide the elec
tion. As soon aa the ballots had been col
lected a motion to adjourn for the day
was carried. The result of . the . ballot
Â¦will be announced to-morrow. "
To-night the. Kpworth I^eagne hosts
gathered, in the Auditorium and held an
anniversary celebration. They ' packed
the great hall from stage to top gallery.

Wishart refused the desired commissions
and while on their way to church with
their wives one Sunday morning the elders
met on a streetcar. In the stormy inter
view that followed, It Is whispered
among the congregation. Elder Dey used
some cuss words. This, in connection with
the trouble over Pastor Smith, caused the
elder to give up his official position.
Back of Elder Dey's withdrawal, it is
said, is the trouble between him and Elder
J. II. Wishart over some commissions on
the sales of a gold saving machine, the In
vention of Wishart. Dey agreed to dis
pose of a machine for a certain commis
sion, which was paid. Through the
agency of the man to whom the gold-saver
was sold, several other purchasers were
found. Dey claimed commissions on these
sales on the contention that It was
through his friend, the buyer of the first
machine, that the others were sold.
Elder Dey and Deacon Beattie were
members of the official board which tried
the charges against tho pastor because or
his alleeed indiscretions during the hear
ing of his wife's application for divorce.
The official board found the pastor guilty,
but when its report was read before the
congregation that body so amended it that
its censuring effect was greatly modified.
This angered some of the members of tho
board and the resignations are the result
of the amendment of their verdict.
As a result of the difference of opinion
in regard to the propriety of certain acÂ»
tlons of the Rev. Guy W. Smith, two more'
members of the ofQclal board of the First
Christian Church of this city have ten
dered their resignation. At a meeting of
the congregation last Sunday evening,
Klder Robert P. Dey and Deacon W. J.
BeatUe, old and active member* of the
church, withdrew from their oiQclal posi
tions.

WASHINGTON, May 15.â The tnlst
question led. to an animated discussion ln
the House Committee on Judiciary to-day,
a constitutional amendment finally belns
adopted by a party vote, giving Congress
power to define, regulate, control, prohibit
or dissolve trusts, monopolies or combina
tions, whether in the form of a corpora
tion or otherwise. This amendment and a
bill restricting trusts were framed some
time ago by a special sub-committee on
trusts. After many delays the work of
the sub-committee was brought before the
full committee to-day with a view to
bringing the trust question before the
House. . . ,
After Beveral attempts to amend the res
olution, which were defeated on party
lines, the committee adopted It, also by a
party vote, the Democrats voting in thti
"l he constitutional amendment as agreed
to and reported to the House proposes tho
following aa article XVI of the constitu
tion:
Section 1. All powers conferred by this article
shall extend to the several States the Territor
ies, the District of Columbia and all territory
under the sovereignty and subject to the Jurlo-
Sec 2 Congress shaTT'have power to define,
regulate, control, prohibit or dissolve trusts,
monopolies or combinations, whether existing
In the form of corporation or otherwise. The eev
e?Â«U SUteTmay continue to exexcise such power
ln any manner not ln conflict with the laws of
ehall have power to enforce
the proVislons of this article by appropriate
legislation. .
The majority report favoring the consti
tutional amendment v says in part:
In our Judgment it is' the plain duty of those
Intrusted with the lawmaklng power to .Propose
and submit to the people of the United States
such a remedy as wllf enable Congrees to rÂ«-
Btruln and. It need be. to repress absolutely all
illegal and dangerous combinations which re
strain trade or destroy competition or whloh
may unjustly harass or oppress labor.
iJibor has Its best friend in aggregated capi
tal corporations and combinations when fairly
and honestly formed and conducted. It Is not
the existence but the abuse of corporate power
and combined capital that merits condemnation
and denunciation and demands a remedy. Such
abuses exist. Hence the necessity for the exist
ence of a competent controlling and restraining
powerâ a power of absolute suppression It may
be ln a given case.
The report Is very long. It argues in
extenso against the proposed remedy of
placing trust-made goods on the free llat,
which remedy, it is asserted, would be
worse than tho disease In "striking down
protection ln an experimental effort to
destroy a monopoly or repress a comblna-
At the afternoon session of the House
Judiciary Committee an anti-trust bill
was ordered to be reported in addition to
the constitutional amendment previously
agreed on. The bill differs from that pre
viously framed and Is amendatory of the
Sherman law. Corporations or associa
tions managed for the purpose of controll
ing or monopolizing the manufacture, pro
duction or sale of any article or for the
purpose of increasing or decreasing the
coBt to the consumer or user, are declared
illegal. It is then provided that such an
organization may be proceeded against
and restrained from carrying on inter
state commerce and If declared illegal
may be forbidden the use of the malls,
and Interstate commerce ln Its products
or property Is then prohibited. .

DEGREES CONFERRED

"These figures," he said. "Indicate the
number of those who have come directly
to the United States, and do not embrace
a very large number (how many not
known by bureau) destined ostensibly to
the Dominion of Canada, and most of
whom, it is believed, ultimately enter the
United States on the northwest Canadian
border. In view of the fact that the rec
ommendation contained in the annual re
ports of the bureau for several years past
to the effect that exclusive ports of entry
for immigrants should be established at
principal points on the boundary between
the United States and Canada have not
been adopted, there is no -means at the
command of the bureau to either Inspect
or keep a record of Immigrants entering
along said border; but the large number
of Japanese engaged ln construction work

Arrivals of Japanese â 1898, 2230;
in 1899, 3395, and for nine months
ending March 31, 1900, 4427.
CALL HEADQUARTERS^ WELLING
TON HOTEL. WASHINGTON, May 15.-
Immlgration Commissioner Powderly to
day sent to Congress, in reply to tho reso
lution of Representative Kahn, informa
tion regarding Japanese immigration. He
gives the following figures:
Special Dispatch to The Call.
firms the Impression above expressedâ
that the bulk of thoso professing to be
destined to Canada ultimately reach this
country.
"With reference to the possibility of in
crease of such immigration lor this year,
this apain is a subject upon which tho
riureau can only conjecture !n general
terms, from the steady Increase in such
arrivals. It Is c-ommim rumor, which
reaches the bureau from time tr> time
from its oSieiats on the Pacific Coast, that
there will be a large increase of such im
micratton."
Mr. Powderly refers to the difficulty ln
the way of managing this Influx and cites
lack of interpreters an one of tho causes
of embarrassment. Mr. Powderly says
his investigations show that Immigration
is fostered by numerous societies, which
derive large profits from commission*
raid either directly by Immigrants or
through the agency of steamship lines.
In anticipation of Increased immigration
of this kind ln future the Immigration
Bureau has sent special agents to the
principal ports . on the Pacific Coaat to
make complete investigation.
Representative Kahn said to-day he
would endeavor to meet the suggestions
of Commissioner Powderly that special
ports for the entry of allena into tho
United States bÂ« provided by Introducing
a bill making that provision.

The recent agitation against the many
delays In the erection of the Hall of Jus
tice building has born fruit. Represen
tatives from the North Central Improve
ment Association will appear before the
Supervisors' Building Committee, this
morning and urge upon that body the
early completion of the structure. The
association is composed of many influ
ential taxpayers who are Interested in the
welfare and advancement of the northern
section of the city. They fully realize the
pecuniary loss to which property owners
and storekeepers in the vicinity of the
Hall of Justice have been subjected and
they will endeavor to devise means
whereby the building may be immediately
occupied by the branches of the municipal
government for which it is intended.
Auditor Wells has expressed his Inten
tion to be present at the conference In
response to the following communication
received by him from the association:
"Will you kindly make an appointment
so that a committee from the North Cen
tral Improvement Association may con
fer with you regarding the status of the
Hall of Justice. The building is so near
completion that surely some arrange
ments can be made so as to prevent such
an extraordinary condition of affairs as
allowing a building in such a state of
completion to remain unoccupied and un
used to the detriment of the public busi
ness and to the continued loss of the
property owners in the vicinity."
"I am glad to see that the North Cen
tral Improvement Association has taken
an interest in this matter." said the Au
ditor yesterday. "The Hall of Justice
could be completed within a week's time
if the contractors so desired It. I believe
the only way out of the present difficulty
is for the Pacific Surety Company, the
bondsmen who have succeeded to the for
feited contract of Batemann Brothers, to
Hnish it and turn the building over to the
city. In this way the Batemanns will be
forced to show what they intend to do
regarding the liens amounting to some
$50,000 which have been filed against them
by firms who have furnished labor and
materials. Of the original construction
fund of J30O.00O I find that only about $1600
will remain after all claims against It are
satisfied. The equipment and furniture
fund of JS5.000 will probably be eaten up
also. I have stopped auditing any de
mands until the . question is properly
settled so as to avoid any litigation that
may result against the city."
Representatives of North Central Im
provement Association Will Con
fer With Auditor and Su
pervisors' Committee.
The Hall of Justice Delay

Take Action.

KEPT TAB ON THOSE
WHO RODE IN CARS
crimes were committed in a building on
Mason street, between Broadway and Val-
Jej'j, and a quantity of property was
etoien. The house is composed of four
Bats, and seems to be an attraction for
crocus, as abo'Jt two months ago one of
the tenants, who was a victim of thieves
last wt-ek. lost jewelry and valuables to
the amount of $10u.
Last Thursday the flat at 1518 Mason
etrttt was entered during the day. It is
occupied by Miss M. Dillon. During her
absence robbers entered and secured a
tliarnond ring valued at $S5 and a pair ot
gold-rimmed eyeglasses.
Saturday evening, during the absence
cf Mrs. K. SI. Borman, at 1516 Mason
street. In the same house, thieves atempt
ed to force an entrance in the rear, but
were frightened away. Before they left,
however, they took several articles from
the back porch.
About two months ago Mrs. Borman's
apartments were burglarized and a pair
of pearl opera glasses, with the initials
"E. B.": a silver match safe, and five
dollars In coin were stolen. The thieves
in this case used skeleton keys and admit
ted themselves through the front door.
In the Dillon robbery the front door was
also opened by false keys. The officers
art? inclined to think that some one well
acquainted on the premises is responsible
for all the crimes.
A Mrs. Warnke, who occupied the same
flat as Mrs. Bnrman. was robbed of nearly
t200 worth of property two years ago.

HOUSE VISITED FOUR
TIMES BY BURGLARS
As Senator Goucher lolls the story it
vns close to the mystic hour of midnight
when he heard something metallic rat
tling in the keyhole of one of the doora of
Jiib room. The burglar did not get In at
door No. 1 and so moved on to door No. Z.
where he again made a rattle, presumably
with a string of skeleton Keys that he had
brought along for the purpose. Door No.
2 was as obdurate as the other and would
i.ot be persuaded to open to the skilled
and larcenous touch oi the midnight in
vader.
By thla time the Senator -was thoroughly
Interested in the proceedings. He had a
pistol on a shelf, but he did not think to
use it. He listened to the noise aa long as
he could Ftand the tension.
"Then," said the Senator last evening,
narrating the occurrence, "I threw the
door wide open and there stood a man
about & feet Js Inches tall and weighing
about ISO pounds as I should judge. He
had a closely cut black xnustacne and
piercing black eyes.
" 'What do you want hereT I asked.
"He said that he would attend to that
or made some such Impudent answer and
I gave him a left hand swing and he went
down on the floor. Then he rolled over
and reached around toward his hip pocket
and 1 hit him again. After that he eeem
ed to be rather limp. The landlord came
rushing in. for the happening made a heap
of noise and he asked me If I wished to
1-ave the man arrested. I said that I
thought that he had been punished
enough, and so the landlord led him away
and down into the street. I am sorry now
that we did not search him to iind out
whether he had any burglar's tools about
blxn. 1 did not wish to be detained here
as a witness and that is why I did not
have him arrested. He spoke good Eng
lish when he first addressed me. He
ppoke broken English after I had hit him.
No. he did not steal anything from me.
All that he said after he was In the hands
of the landlord was that he wanted to go
home."
A bold, bad burglar man attempted to
enter the room at the Launston. 110 Eddy
etreet. Monday night, in which Senator
Goucher of Fresno was peacefully repos

APPEARS ON THE SCENE
Joseph Bennett, the young milkman who
disappeared last Saturday after writing a
letter to his employer stating that he was
going to commit suicide because his lady
love was not true. ha3 turned out to be
a* prince of bluffers or is certainly some
what erratic. ' .. ...
He has not been seen around the mim

employed., since he left his unique note of
farewell. The young man, however, is not
dead and has no idea of dying If he can
help himself. Â¦Â¥Â¦'--;
With some motive or other in view, he
desires his friends and acquaintances to
believe that he will not be happy until he
takes his own life. He made a big bluff
yesterday to create the impression that
he was sincere. , ,
He emerged from hi3 hiding place and
strolled out to the park. He took a look
of despondency with him and did every
thing possible to attract the attention of
Park Policeman Ball. The officer spotted
Bennett as a prospective suicide and fol
lowed him. When the milkman thought
he had wrought the copper up to the
right pitch he dashed into a clump of un
derbrush, pretended to swallow the con
tents of an empty bottle, fell to the
ground and began digging his heels Into
the sand and his hands Into the fleshy
covering of his stomach.

the man to the driveway and sent him
post haste in the patrol wagon to the Re

throat, but when the doctors began work
ing the machine it failed to draw up any
poison or even half-digested food. Ben

made him feel uncomfortable, when he

he had had enough.
He admitted when the tube was with
drawn from his internal regions that he
was "only joking, anyway."

by as many people as the hall could hold.
The decorations were orange and each

throw at one another. They were made
of light tissue paper filled with little
scraps of paper after the manner of cas

The story published by The Call last
Sunday to the effect that the Denver and
Rio Grande Railroad had decided to ex
tend its line from Grand Junction, Cclo..
to the southern part of the State receives
confirmation from the granting of a fran
chise in Los Angeles Monday, which is
supposed to be for tho use of a new trans
continental line.
This franchise was obtained by the Los
Angeles Terminal Railway after much op
position by the Southern Pacific, a dis
patch from the southern city says. Thfe
statement is made that it is thought the'
terminal franchise Is to be used by some

The selection of the new site- will be
followed by -the construction of buildings
provided with all the modern equipment
for handling the company's rolling stock
and operating appliances. >
The plans for the structure comprehend
space for 125 cars. There will also be the
sub-station for the handling of the elec
tric current, which will be supplied from
the Independent Electric Company's plant
In South San Francisco-. The power for
the entire road will be furnlsned from
that source. Such apparatus as It neces- ,
sary to handle the current will be Install
ed at the new station. It is expected
that from 400 to 500 employes of the road
will be centered about the new headquar
ters.
One of the chief considerations which
led to the selection of the site was the
fact that it Is half way between the ter
minals now projected. At present there
are a few cottages and a vegetable garden
on the property.'
The property acquired Is a block of
land, 450 feet by 450 feet, fronting on San
Jose avenue and on the main line of the
company's tracks. The site is about a
mile south of Sunnyslde, where the pres
ent powerhouse Is located. In addition to
this purchase the company has bonded,
through G. H. Umbsen & Co., its agents,
adjacent blocks, which will probably be
acquired in a short time.
Negotiations have been In progress for
several weeks with relation to the prop
erty. After the site was fixed upon by
the company's directors as meeting all
requirements of the new conditions of the
road the preliminaries were closed up as
rapidly aa possible, as it Is the company's
desire to push as speedily as possible the
many improvements which have been
planned for the service. Ever since the
rejuvenation of the system there has oaen
such a marked effort to increase the ac
commodations for patrons that there Is a
manifest Interest in every forward step
taken.
The San Francisco and San Mateo Elec
tric Railway Company has made an Im
portant move in the development of bet
ter traffic facilities' and conveniences for
both the traveling public and Its em
ployes. Thero was completed yesterday
the purchase by the company of the block
of land known as "Mammy" Pleasant'B
homestead, on San Jose avenue, near
Ocean "View, to be the site for the new
car houses, sub-station and operating
headquarters of the system. The loca
tion is about midway on the road's line
to San Mateo, tho latter place being the
present objective point of the system's
extension.

BOY DIES FROM EFFECTS
OF A GUNSHOT WOUND
It was not Klncaid himself the Judge
saw. That was certain, for the Judge has
known Kincaid for some time. It was not
Mxonv for the Judge Â¦ said no, â¢ for his
height was against him and he could not
pass muster. It was not GUlespie. nor
Kincaid then explained that Nixon on
April 22 was inside guard; that he had to
remain In the office of the Jail and receive
visitors, for Sunday is visiting day, and
see that nothing contraband was taken
in to the prisoners. "I can swear," said
Klncaid, * f that Nixon was not out of the
Jail on that day,!' and the Judee was si
lent; but later on, when Kincaid repeated
the same statement and courted a reply
by adding, "and you must believe me,''
the Judge smiled blandly and said, "Why.
of course, that Is a matter of opinion."
a statement so obvious that it was ac
cented without comment
Nixon remained upon the rack for a
while, repeating his statements over and
over, and then fie gave place to the second
guard. John Gillesple.
The Judge wouldn't - have GiHeepIe at
all. "He's not the man," declared his
Honor; and beyond telling what hours he
kept GUlespie did but little talking. There
was a third guard. Peter Devalli,' but' he
Is gray and past middle life and round ot
form and with a gray beard. This
was out of all comparison with the
Judge's description, of. the man. he saw.
and so the look the party took at Devalli
as he ushered the visitors through . the
gate was taken as sufficient to exonerate
him. . : â¢ - - - Â»
A light broke over the face of Mr. Kin
caid. "He Is the smallest man we -have
working out here," he said, with an ac
cent that denoted real regi-et that Nixon
was no smaller. "Yea, he looks like tho
man I saw," repeated the Judge thought
fully, "but the man I Faw in the car had
to reach up for the strap. Now you
wouldn't have to reach up for the strap,
would you?" asked the Judge, and Nixon
confessed that he would notâ that Is, not
very high.
"The man I saw had on a light suit,"
continued the Judge. .
"I wear a light coat and vest when I am
dressed up," Nixon admitted, but he add
ed that his trousers ' under the same cir
cumstances were generally dark:
The first man called was William R.
Nixon, the guard who was on Inside guard
duty all the Sunday of April 22 last. He
was tall and spare, with sharp features
and a sandy mustache. The Judge looked
at him carefully and then said he resem
bled the man he saw on the cars with the
woman, but he was too tail to be the
same.
The force at Branch Jail No. 2 was un
der the scrutiny of the Judge yesterday
Under the Invitation of the Sheriff he was
allowed to call whomsoever he pleased and
to question and examine in any way he
saw fit. The examination was held in the
parlor of the Jail. Ranged around on the
upholstered cnairs were the Judge, who
was allowed the place of honor next the
table; Sheriff Lackmann, who chose the
soft end of a sofa; Under Sheriff George
Hare; 1. P. Klncaid. the superintendent*
Mrs. Kincaid, his wife; the head matron,
Mrs. Conlon; the second matron, and a
bevy of reporters and artists, who heara
and saw and looked wise.
And a double has appeared on the
scene â one who can be described as resem
bling Mrs. Botkin; and the hundreds who
have been gazing at pretty Mrs. Georglna
Thompson in the belief that she was Mrs. ;
Botkin have had their morbid pleasure
for their pains and their testimony of the
prisoner's wanderings has. gone for
naught. Mrs. Thompson is the mother of
Mrs. Murphy, the daughter-in-law , of
Judge Murphy. She is a plump, round-,
faced, jolly little woman, who, while not
pleased at the notoriety the resemblance
brings upon her, is nevertheless getting
considerable enjoyment out of the humor
of the situation. Can it be that Judge
Cook took a good look at Mrs. Thompson
wh,en he thought he saw Mrs. Botkin?
That is another question in the case that
has claimed attention.
the day Judge Cook says he saw her Mrs.
Botkin never left her room. And If he
didn't, how Is lt-that every time the pos
sibility of a doubt Is suggested the Judge
shakes his head and declares he ought to
know the woman he sentenced to prison
for life? Either the Judge is mistaken
and the Jailers are right or the Judge Is
correct and the jailers are wrong, and It
seems to be an even thing between them.
Then everyone fell to discussing the af
fair, and . various Ideas were advanced.
Kincaid and the two matrons scouted the
Idea that the prisoner could have got out
any . way but through the main corridor,
and that she could. have passed through
that without being- seen. .Also .that sne
could have been taken out % by any. back
-Then a brilliant- suggestion that Mrs.
Botkin; rigged. In the dress she wore when
she went to the dentist, be brought before
the group, was acted upon and the pris
oner was walked to the center of the par
lor in street edstume. She was dressed In
black, plain skirt and waist, and on her
head was a spreading Â¦ black hat. Her
face was partly concealed by a black veil
The hat brought, new conviction to the
Judge.
â¢ "I wasn't sure when" I saw. her down
stairs," he ventured, "but now Â¦ that, I
have seen her .in that hat I am more than
ever convinced that she was the woman
I saw on the car. It was then Kincaid
received the suggestion as to what was a
matter of opinion. Mrs.' Botkin swept out
of the room and the Investigation, having
completed a circle, found itself Just where
It had started.
Then they all fell to discussing the time
Mrs. Botkin was allowed out to see her
dentist. On an order from Judge Bahrs,
signed April 17, Klncaid took the prisoner
downtown, on April 18, to Dr. Graham's
on Sutter street. On the way there she
asked If she could, be allowed to see her
attorneys. Knight & . Heggerty, In the
Parrott building, and Klncaid took her
there. Â¦;.â¢â¢Â¦ - . Â¦ ;
"Did she see her attorneys?" de
manded Cook. â¢ . Â¦- - â¢
"Yes," said Kincaid, "she saw them In
my presence."
Â¦ "Let them both be brought Into court,"
was the Judge's order, and. the two attor
neys will be haled before' the Judge to
answer whether or no, they had a call
from Mrs." Botkin at 'any other time since
she was sentenced. - â¢ - Â¦-- .'
'iThey want to see how you looked that
day you were out," he said, for It had
been suggested that If the guards and the
prisoner were seen together it might have
a good effect. It threw no light on the
Judge's framo of mind, however, and then
GUlespie took his place beside the pris
oner. But that brought no result, so Mrs.
Botkin bowed the party out and the par
lor was filled again.
Mrs. Botkin herself was strangely
gowned and the strangest part of her
clothes was her hat. It was an outland
ish, pot-shaped bonnet of the stylo of a
score of years ago, and it gave her a most
fantastic air, as she waited In dignified
silence for the squad of visitors to tell
what they were about. Nixon pushed Into
the room and stood beside her.
Mrs. Botkin. is confined in an old drug
room, at the end of the dormitory, not
in the matron's room, at the end of the
upper hall. It is a plain apartment with
big windows, through which the afternoon
sun streams with a warmth and gener
osity even the iron bars across the panes
cannot hold back. And on the bed lay a
baby, clean and pink and peaceful as
though no shadow of a lock or bar ever
fell upon it. It was the child of one of
the prisoners, and while Mrs. Botkin
waits and watches for the word from the
Supreme Court she washes and sews and
sings for the babe and Uikes pnue in the
fact that it doesn't look a bit like a prison
child.
Klncaid then spoke up once more and
described the precautions taken to pre
vent escapes and violations of the rules.
The only keys to the dormitories, where
the women are confined, are in the hands
of Mrs. Conlon and Mrs. Kincaid. There
are no others besides these two sets and
no one can come or go through the single
door to each dormitory except either one
of the women uirows the bolt. Then, too,
Kincaid said he or one of the guards was
always on 'duty in the main corridor and
no one could pass in or out without being
seen, and no one could pass in or out
without passing through the main cor
ridor. The Judge then repeated his story
of the woman and the man he had seen,
and the superintendent declared' once
more that no one could leave the jail
without his knowledge and he knew Mrs.
Botkin had never strayed away. This
brought matters to a long silence, until
it was suggested that the Judge take a
look at Mrs. BotKin, who was In her room
at the end of one of the jformltories. This
was agreed to and the whole crowd went
down below and laid siege to Mrs. Bot
kin's apartment.
Devalli, and that ended the list of em
ployes, unless the two matrons, Mrs. Kin
cald and Mrs. Conlon, were considered
eligible. And a careful inquiry by Judge,
Sheriff and reporters showed only that
tho guards of the other jail were never
allowed to visit the women's jail unless
they had business to transact. â¢ .
The possibilities of a double In the case
may lead to all sorts of- complications. If
it can be shown mat Mrs. Thompson
bought candy at Haas' store and that she
.traded at the various places where Mrs.
Botkin was supposed to trade, it might
not be hard for the prisoner's attorneys to
bring the' matter before the court in such
a fashion as to throw doubt on all the
identifications. In that case the result
would be hard to predict. - , â¢
| But in the meantime the question of lib
erty remains unsettled. Judge Cook be
lieves his eyes.- The Sheriff believes his
ears and what his men swear to, and the
Jailers repeat as often as asked that,
whether or not, the Judge to the contrary,
Mrs. Botkin never stepped from the prison
except . when ' Klncaid took her In his
buggy to have her teeth fixed.
The double, Mrs. Thompson, was nurs
ing her daughter, who is suffering from
the after effects of a smash-up ,on the
Hyde street line. She was. at Judg-e Mur
phy's residence, 123 - Liberty street, and
was quite prepared for the statement that
she might have been taken for Mrs. Bot
kin. .. . , v
"I have often been taken for Mrs. Bot
kin," she said, "particularly during the
trial. I used to hear .people around me
saying, 'There's â¢â¢ Mrs.' 'Botkin' and then
they would point me out. I am sure, how
ever, that I am not the one Judge Cook
saw on the- cars. I know Judpo Cook by
sight and I am sure I would remember if
I had seen him on that day. I ride on the
Guerrero street cars. but very seldom and
I- know I was not riding, on them that
Sunday." . .
way. Then some one suggested that dou
ble, and as that -was a matter that could
not be settled In the Jail, the Inquisitors
left the Jail. and. came Into the city.
Tho idea of .a; double had thrown new
light on the matter, for It was plain that
if the double and not Mrs. Botkin had
crossed, the Judge's path the mystery
could be cleared at once. But It Is not so
certain thai It was tho. double that Cook
saw. ... :
