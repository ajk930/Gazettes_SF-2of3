Baden-Poweirs Hardest Blow.
Baden-Powell's hardest blow to the be
siegers was the rapture of Commandant
fiarel lEloff. President Kru S er B grandson,
and his men. ,
It is thus described in a dispatch from
Mafoking May 12. via Ootil May 14:
"Eloff to-day fell into one of the various
traps that have been left open for months
At 4 a. m. the onomy. who had been much
urongthenc-d during the last few days
Mnted an attack on the eastern side of
the town, while a large force which during
the night had crept along the river, guided
by native rebels who had ohose n the
craftiest detours, managed to enter the
I-axalong location. This they burned and
day a promise to entertain any credentials
that might be presented to-day. This
morning a note came to the State Depart
ment from the delegates asking that they
be permitted to present themselves at the
department. A prompt acquiescence Was
returned by Secretary Hay, and the hour
of 2:30 was fixed for the meeting. At that
time the three delegates appeared. They
were unaccompanied and were shown at
once into the diplomatic room. Secretary
Hay. accompanied by Mr. Babcock his
private secretary and stenographer! en
tered the diplomatic room and cordially
greeted his visitors. Just what passed be
tween them probably will never be exactly
known,, for when the meeting was over
after lasting ah. hour, the Boers, In de
parting, stated to a number of 'anxious
newspaper men that they had and would
have nothing 1 to say as to what happened
For his part, the Secretary.of State was
more communicative, but before making
any statement 1 he ma.de his- way to the
White House and consulted the President.
Then he gave out through his secretary
the following statement:
Messrs. A. FIscrfrÂ»r, C. H. Wesspls and A. D.
W. Wolmarans. the delrrctes In j this country
cf the South African republics, called to-day
by appointment at the State Department. They
were cordially received, and remained with the
Secretary of State for more than an hour. They
laid before the Secretary at much length and
with great enersry and. eloquence the merits
of the controversy In South Africa and the
desire of the Boer republics that the United
States should . Intervene in - the â¢ Interests of
peace' and UFe" its efforts to that end 'with the
British Government.
The Secretary of State made the following
reply: 'Â¦,'Â¦? +k0
"The President In his message to Coneress,
last December, taid: "This Government has
maintained an attitude of neutrality .in the
unfortunate contest betwpen Great Britain and
the Boer states of Africa. We have remained
fal thru I to the precept -of 'avoiding: entangllnR
alliances as to affairs not of onr direct con
cern. Had circumstances suggested that the
parties to the quarrel would\have welcomed
a kindly *"ext)iefslon of the hope, of the Ameri- :
can peonle that war might he; averted, good
offices would have teen gladly tendered."
.."As the war went on tne' President, while
regretting the suffering and. the sacrifices en
dured by both of the combatants. ; could do
nothing but preserve a strict neutrality ' be
tween them. This he- has . steadily and con
scientiously done, but there ; never was a mo
ment when he would have neglected any fav
orable occasion to use' his good offices in the
Interests of peace. ~
"On Â»Jie 10th of last March we received from
Mr. Hay, the Unit*! Slates Consul at Pre
toria, this tel;?ram: 'I cm officially r*quej,te<5

WASHINGTON. May 21. -The .State
Department has met the issue raised by
the coming to Washington of the Boer
delegation by declining to interfere in be
half of the South African republics In the
present struggle. In view of this an
nounced decision all questions as to the
character of the recognition to be extend
ed to the delegates and the sufficiency of
their credentials dropped at once Into the
background. It was, after all. of little mo
ment whether or not the Boers were re
ceived as diplomatic agents or ministers
so long as they were powerless to promote
the prime object of their mission, namely,
to cause the United States Government to
Intervene to bring about peace.
The meeting between the delegates and
Secretary Hay was brought about In the
simplest manner. General O'Beirne had
secured from the department last Satur-

The War Office received the following
dispatch from Lord Roberts earlier in the
day:

... .As illusion had been made to The Hague
conference, and as action. had^been suggested
based upon that Instrument, U.may'te as'wrtl
to. Quote a pfcrnee from article III, which
states: "Powers -stranirer to the dispute may
have the right to offer good offices or media
tion even during the course of hostilities," and
article V. which says: "The functions of the
mediator are at, an end when once it Is de
clared either by one gf the parties to the dis
pute or by the mediator himself that the. means
of reconciliation proposed by him are not ac
cepted " This would seem to render any fur
ther action of the United States unadvlsable
under existing circumstances.
The . stew) taken by the President In his
earnest desire to see an end to the strife which
has caused eo much suffering may already be
eald to have gone to the extreme limit per
mitted to him. Indeed, If in hla discretion he
had chosen not to present to England the South
African request for good offices, he might have
Justified his action by referring to the follow
ing declaration which was made in the very
act of signing The Hatrue convention by the
plenipotentiaries of the United States: "Noth
lnc contained In this convention shall be so
construed as to require of the United States of
America to deoart from its traditional policy
of not intruding upon, interfering with, en
tangling itself with questions if policy or in
ternal administration of any foreign states:
nor shall anything contained in said convention
be construed to Imply a rellnuiilshment by the
United States of America of Its traditional at
titude toward purely American questions."
' The President sympathizes heartily in the sin
cere desire of all the pedple of the United
States that the war which la now afflicting
South Africa may Mr the sake of both parties
engaged come to a speedy close; but having
done his full duty in preserving a strioUy neu
tral position between them and In seizing the
first "opportunity that presented itself for ten
dering iils good offices In the Interests of peace,
he feels that In the present circumstances no
course is open to him except to persist in the
policy "of Impartial neutrality. To deviate from
this would be contraary to all our traditions
and all our national Interests and would lead
to conÂ«equenccs which neither the President nor
the people of the United States should regard
with favor.

VANCOUVER. B. C. May 21.â A sensa
satlon was caused to-day as the result of
investigations by officials of the United
States Immigration Office here, which is
in charge of Hon. A. E. Healy. It de
veloped that not only were Japanese
working a swindling game on the officials,
but the newly arrived sons of the Mika
do's empire, who have come In such herds
lately, were being bilked on a wholesale
scale by their more experienced country
men who have lived in Vancouver for sev
eral years.
The law requires that immigrants to the
States cannot be paupers, but must have
at least $30. The officials were surprised
during the past week at the readiness \
with which the Japanese came up with
their money, but had no choice but to
give them their papers. Hundreds have
been put through in this way. To-day,
however, the demand was made a second
time for the exhibition of 530 and it was
found that there was only $5 among a
score of Japanese, who were leaving by
a stage for the United States.
They afterward exolained that they
borrowed the money to pass the officials
on and in every case paid highly for the
loan of $30 for an hour, some as much as
$3. It was also found that the Japanese
contractors here were representing to
their fellow countrymen that the fee3
were $4 Instead' of $1 for passing the Im
migration Officer, and that'in'hundreds of
instances they had pocketed the differ
ence. It is estimated oy the officials that
$3000 has been taken from the newly ar
rived Japanese by bilking methods.

Parliamentary Secretary of the Brit

mation in the Commons.
LONDON. May 21.â In the House of
Commons to-day the Parliamentary Sec
retary of the Foreign Office, Mr. Broder
ick, answering questions on the subject,
Fald that the British Government under-
Kood the Russian Government had leased
a site for a coal depot and naval hospital
at the treaty port of Masampho, in Korea.
This port, he added, was open to navi
gators of all countries, and the landing
and storage of supplies for the Russian
licet within the site Just acquired Is to be
governed by the existing treaties there.
Therefore no exclusive right was ceded to
the Russian Government, and the treaty
rights ceded to British subjects were not
to be limited by the arrangements recent
ly arrived at.
The Government, also understood that an
agreement had been made by which Rus
sia undertook neither to ask, for itself or
for its subjects t-ny concession on the Isl
and of Koji or on the opposite mainland,
or on any of the surrounding Islands, and
the Korean Government engaged not to
allow any other Government to rent or en
k'ace land in the localities Indicated.
Mr. Broderick concluded, rather lamely,
that as. the Government had not yet ob
tained poyppsslon of the text of the agree
ment it could not say whether the action
of Russia was In accordance with her ex
plicit pledges not to acquire any territory
whatever In Korea.

"The Senator from Minnesota," re

into this question the merits of the war

Hoar, replying, said: "No man has a
more hearty admiration for the Boer re
publics or a greater sympathy for their
gallant tight than 1 have. It is the best
fighting done on this planet-slnce Ther
mopylae, and no .fighting has been done

mission. Under our constitution and cus
toms the function of recognizing and re
ceiving diplomatic agents belongs primar
ily to the President. If we admit to the
floor of the Senate these gentlemen in
their official -capacity we are extending to
them recognition by the Senate as repre

WASHINGTON, May 21.â A pyro
technic discussion oi the status
of the Boor Commissioners now
in Washington was precipitated
in the Senate to-day by a reso
lution offered by Allen of Nebraska ex
tending to the Commissioners the privi
lege of the fioor of the Senate during their
sojourn in the national capital. The reso
lution was defeated by a vote of 36 to 21.
but not until after a sharp controversy
between its author and Davis, chairman
of the Committee on Foreign Relations.
Allen maintained that the resolution was
In lino with precedents, while Davis con
tended that In the present circumstances
the Senate ought not take any action that
might be considered a recognition of Boer
diplomats until the President, who alone
had the power to receive diplomatic rep*
resentatires. had taken action.
Allen Cites Precedents.
Allen maintained It was the universal
practice of the Senate to extend to such
visitors the courtesies of the Senate, cit
ing the recognition by the Senate of
Charles Stuart Parnell years ago and the
more recent recognition of Lord Herschell
and the members of the joint High Com
mission from Canada. The Boer Commis
sioners, he said, desired to lay before the
American people the facts concerning the
present war. They were not seeking any
thing: but th<Â» friendly offices of this Gov
ernment and that natural sympathy
which they had a right. Allen thought,
to expect from a people so devoted to the
cause of liberty as were the Americans.
Davis of Minnesota, chairman of the
Committee on Foreign Relations, opposed
the resolution.
"This resolution," said he, "recognizes
thp gentlemen by name as the Commls
rionera of the South African governments.
That recognition by the constitution is
confined exclusively to the President of

epeat several hours to-day in discussion
ot legislation in order to make his extra
dition absolutely certain, but adjourned
without taking any definite action. An
other meeting Is to be held later In the
week for the purpose of. agreeing, If pos
sible, upon a measure which will accom
plish this end. but so many different
views are entertained by members of
the committee of both houses that it Is
by no means certain that an extradition
measure can be enacted during the re
maining days of the session. Without
legislation Neely, it is feared, will be able
through habeas corpus proceedings to
prevent hla extradition.
Senator Hoar's unwillingness to have
the Philippines Included In the list of de
pendencies covered by the pending extra
dition bill accounts for the failure of the
Judiciary Committee to-day, and has re
sulted in the framing of several measures
different from the one transmitted to both
bouses by Attorney General Grjggs.
In the opinion of the members of the
committee Mr. Griggs 1 bill is not suffi
ciently broad in scope to cover all possi
bilities of escape from crimes committed
In the new dependencies. The measure
which met*ts with the most general ap
proval is one introduced in the Senate to
3ay by Fairbanks, which provides for the
extradition of fugitives from Cuba and
all of the new American dependencies
who may escape to the United States or
any foreign country. Griggs' bill only
applied to the United States and Cuba,
and it was pointed out in the discussion
to-day that should Neely take refuge in
t,'unada or any other foreign country It
would be impossible under its provisions
to extradite him.
Director Rathbone Suspended-
The Postmaster General has suspended
Director General of Posts Rathbone and
appointed Fourth Assistant Postmaster
Uer.eral Bristow Acting Director General
Â»f Posts in Cuba.
It is presumed that the action taken
to-day was based upon reports received
by the Postmaster General from Fourth
Assistant Posimaster General Bristow at
Havana. The Postmaster General, when
asked if Mr. Rathbone's suspension was
due simply to negligence in administering
â¢Cuban jwjstal affairs .--aid that such might
Jje the inference drawn. When* asked
whether 2&r. Rathbone was at liberty to
leave the Island the Postmaster General
replied that Ocneral Wood had control
uf that branch of the subject and would
act as he thought proper. As it was
stated, however, that the ex-Director
General would be Investigated together
with ail others connected with the alleged
frauds, it is apparent that he is under
surveillance en.i cannot leave the island.
Whether or not his connection with the
postal service has been .severed perma
nently was not stated.
The" Postmaster General said he would
welcome an investigation of the postal
affairs of Porto Kico, as he was continent
they would bear the closest exposure, ln
etances of loss of postal funds had oc
turred there several months ago, but it
was decided that the department could
not make out a. case strong enough to

stood that a compromise was effected and
the department carries on Its books
several thousand dollars as a loss. It is
stated on good authority that the clerk
who wa? involved in the case was dis
missed from the office at Ponce and when

WASHINGTON. May 21.â The Kentucky

Interest of Beckham affirming the deci

The opinion was handed down by Chief
Justice Fuller.' and the case was dis

the ground that the determination of
case? of this character, contests for State
oflicfs. must necessarily be settled by the
political branch of the government. That
branch. It was Ftated. had acted in the

tribunal, the Chief Justice paid, was al

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, May 21.â The citizens'
movement for reform in politics met
a Waterloo' in to-day's election at
the hands of practical politicians.
The rout resulted from lack of or
ganization and workers, while Johnnie
Mackenzie handled the gang fight in per
son and his ticket went through without
a hitch." Mayor C. J. Martin was re
elected over Harry J. Kd wards by a ma
jority of 629, while Treasurer Thomas J.
McGeoghegan's majority 13 1174. The
other officers elected are: J. W. Cook,
City Clerk; J. J. Cherrie. Councilman
from the Second "Ward, and D. A. Porter,
Councilman from the Third AVard.
The election was one of the most
spirited in the history of the city and the
outcome was a sort of surprise, as it was
generally claimed on the street that Ed
wards would win. Edwards had the nom
ination of the Citizens' Committee of One
Hundred, the indorsement of the Pastors'
Knlon and was supported by the Jeffer
sonian Democracy and the Reform Dem
ocrats. Martin and his mates, who are
all Incumbents, except the Councllmen,
had the support of the Rea gang.
Being the first election under the new
charter added interest; as the party nom
inating 1 conventions were abolished and
all candidates were compelled to go on
the ticket by petition. The day passed
off quietly and heavy voting was done in
the forenoon. The -vote was slightly be
low that of two years ago. 3884 votes be
ing cast. The result Is a complete victory
for the gang, who will now control the
city for the next two years. Leaders of
the citizens' party fail to account for the
landslide except Indifference on the part
of voters. Mayor Martin says the result
is an Indorsement of his administration
and that the only reason he sought re
election was that he might carry out
plans already laidâ the applying of the
cash basis fund in two years to free the
city of debt.
E. B. Mercadler, Socialist-Labor party
candidate for Mayor, received SI votes.
The vote for the various candidates was:
Mayor, Martin 2218, Edwards 1589; Clerk
Cook 2234. Dougherty 1538: Treasurer, Mc-
Geoghegan 2414, Fischer 1340; Councilman

MAYOR C. J. MARTIN OF SAN JOSE.
States, and where controversies over the elec
tion of State officers have reached the State
ooitrts In the manner provided and have been
determined In accordance with State consti
tutions an-j lawn the cases must necessarily be
rare In which the interference of this court
can be properly invoked.
The Chief Justice then reviewed the
cases of Boyd vs. Thayer, Wilson vs.
North Carolina. Junard vs. Louisiana and
Foster vs. Arkansas, and continued:
The grounds on v.-hich our jurisdiction Is
nought to be maintained in the present case
are eet forth in the errors assigned to the fol
; lowing effect, in substance:
1. That t!ie action of the General Assembly
! in the matter of contests deprives plaintiffs
in error of their offices without due process of
law.
2. That the action nf the fSeneral Assembly
deprives the people of Kentucky of the right
to chnose their own representatives secured by
th* guarantee of the Federal constitution of a
, republican form of sovernment to every State
-and decrives them of their political liberty
i without due crocer-s of law.
For more than 100 years the constitution of
j Kentucky has provide that contested elections
j for Governor and Llemenant Governor shall be
: determined ny the General Assembly â In 1790
by a committee "to be selected from both
. h"U!M>s r.f the Orneral Assembly and framed
! and r^Biilatfvi Jn *uch a manner as Ehall be
I directed by law": since l?."iO by both houses of
the General Assembly "according to such regu
lations as may be established by law."
General Assembly's Powers.
The highest court of tlio State has often held
and In the present case lias again declared that
und^r their constitutional provisions the power
, of the General Assembly to determine the re
i suit is exclusive and that Its decision is not
j nwn to Judicial review.
I The Ftatute cnartMl for the purpose of carry
j ing th<* provision of the constitution into. effect
' has been in existence in substance since 1790,
and many States have similar constitutional
;.rovipions> and similar statute*.
We do not understand this statute to be ob- |
i Jfofd tr> as in any manner obnoxious to con
| ftitutional objection, but that plalnt'ffs In
error complain of the action of the General !
Assembly under the statute under the judg- I
m^nt Â¦â¢f the State courts declining to disturb
that action.
It must be admitted that the view that public
I office Is tnt j-roporty has been generally en
tertained In this country.
Quoting Butler vs. the United States
and Crenshaw vs. the United States, the
Chief Justice continued:
The decisions are numerous to the effect that
public offices are mere agencies or trusts and
not property, as such, nor are the salary and
emoluments property, secured by contract, but
compensation for services actually rendered.
N'or does the fact that a constitution may for
! bid the Legislature from abolishing: a public
office or diminlshln? the salary thereof dur
ing- the term of the Incumbent, change Its char
acter or make it property. True, restrictions
limit the power of the Legislature to deal witn
the office, but even such restrictions may be
removed by constitutional amendment.
In short, the nature of the relation of a
public office to the public is, generally speak
ing, inconsistent with either a property or a
contract rishL
Views of the Dissenters.
There were three dissenting opinions,
but in only one of these was the opinion
exprppspd that the decision of the Ken
tucky Court of Appeals should be re
versed. This was delivered by Justice
Harlan. Justice McKenna was the first
of the dissenters to be heard. He stated
that while he concurred in the result, he
was not prepared to pay that a public of
fice was not property.
Justice Brewer also expressed views an
tagonistic to those of the court on the
point of office as property. He held the
view that the United States courts were
not without jurisdiction; but contended
that the decision of the Kentucky courts
should be affirmed, instead of dismissing
the writ of error. He agreed Â¦with the
Court of Appeals of Kentucky, that upon
the award of the Assembly no other judg
ment couli be entered than that which
sustained it.
Justice Harlan, in his dissent, quoted
various authorities and then said: .
Notwithstanding this adjudication, the de
cision to-<lay is that this court has no Juris
diction to Inquire whether the citizen has been
deprived without due process of law of an
office heM Â»>>â¢ him under the constitution and
Jaws <â¢>< this State. If the contest between
the one holding the office and the person seek
i!iK to hold it is determinable by the Legls-
I8tur<\ in a prescribed mode, this court, it
appears, cannot inquire whether that mode
Â»af pursued and cannot interfere for the pro
tfvtion r>r the Incumbent, even if the final act
of thÂ» I>tKiiÂ«lature was confessedly capricious
and arbitrary, inconsistent with the recognized
principles that belong to due process of law
and not baport in any degree on evidence taken
In the contest.
If the Kentucky legislature had wholly dis
regarded th* mode prescribed by the statutes
or that State and without appointing a board
of contest, composed of its own members, had
by joint resolution simply declared Goebel
Governor and especially If such action had
been held by the highest court of the State
to be conclusive, this court, as we are In
formed by the decision Just rendered would
be without Jurisdiction to protect the incum
bent, for the reason, as is now adjudged, that
the office in dispute Is not properly within
the meaning of the fourteenth amendment.
Permits Theft of Office.
So that while we may inquire whether or
not the citizen's land or his mulea have been
taken from htm by the legislative, executive
or Judicial authorities of his State without due
process of law, we may not Inquire whether
the Legislature or Judicial authorities of a.
State have without due process of law ousted
one lawfully elected and holding the office
of Governor for a fixed term with a salary
which cannot be diminished during guch term,
and put Into his place one whom the people
have said should not exercise the authority
appertaining to that high position. When the
fourteenth amendment forbade any State from
depriving any person of life, liberty or property
without due process of law. I had supposed
that the purpose was to guard persons against
being deprived of any legal right In violation
of the fundamental guarantees that Inhere in
due process of law. >
But it seems that under our system of Gov
ernment, the right of a citizen to exercise a
State office to which he has been lawfully
elected by the people may. go far as the con
stitution of the United States . Is concerned,
be taken from him by the arbitrary action of
a State Legislature In uttw disregard of tne
principle that Anglo-Saxon freemen have for
centuries dee-med tt be Â¦ essential to the re

FLOWERS CAST UPON
GRAVE OF GOEBEL
FRANKFORT. Ky., May 21.â The an
nouncement of the Supreme Court's deci
sion at Washington In the Governorship
contest was received here with the wild
est demonstration on the part of the Dem
ocrats. The nrebells' were ringing, can
non booming and the city was put in holi
day attire in honor of Governor Beckham.
A touching incident of the day occurred
this evening, when 2000 people marched to
the cemeterv, each wearing a flower,
which was cast upon the grave of the late
William Goebel, making the little mound
which marks his last resting place a vast
bank of flowers. There were no ceremo
nies at the grave except a prayer by Rev.
T. F. Taliaferro of the Methodist church.
This afternoon the Taylor soldiers who
have been in charge of the State Capitol
building, and grounds since January 30,
the day Governor Goebel was assassin
ated. evacuated and turned the State
grounds, the Gatling guns and military
equipments over to Assistant Adjutant
General Merray, a Democrat. The Taylor
soldiers before giving up their sovereignty
on the State Capitol square were lined up
by Adjutant General Collier who *otÂ«Â«>"v
notified them he had orders from GovernO P
Taylor to dismiss all the soldiers, auu
that the evacuation would begin at once.
There was hurry and bustle for the next
hour, and at 5 o'clock special coaches
backed up in front of the Statehouse for
the, use of the soldiers. Before they left
cheers were given for the deposed Gov
ernor. W. S. Taylor; ex-Governor Bradley,

SAN JOSE. May 21.â The California
Cured Fruit Association has not secured
the requisite 90 per cent of the prune
acreage of the State and the handling of
the crop along different lines will be tried.
At to-day's conference with the packers'
committee President Bond of the asso
ciation announced that but 79 per cent
of the total bearing prune acreage had
been secured and 23 per cent of that had
been* signed on. the proviso that the as
sociation would control 90 per cent. This
released the packers from their contract
with the association.
President Bond was confident with mod
ifications the association would be a suc
cess. The suggestion was made that the
packers organize and treat with the as
sociation as a body. The Cured Fruit As
sociation would secure the expression of
all its members as to whether they were
willing to let the association handle their
fruit if in the opinion of the directors
enough had beÂ»n signed to warrant them
going ahead. Stable prices of dried fruit
could not be guaranteed, but from time to
time as the conditions of the market war
ranted the directors would set the price
of fruit. This would eliminate the com
petition of growers outside the associa
tion and strengthen the association tn
case the full percentage could not be se
cured. The packers readily accepted this
proposal and agreed to buy fruit only
from members of the association.
Letters will at once be sent to all mem
bers of the association asking it they are
willing to accept these changes. The di
rectors are confident that those who are
now in the association will do so. In
fact many of the prune men outside the
association are expected to now come in.'
The packers* committee held an extend
ed session discussing the details of the
new agreement. Organization among
themselves will do away with ruinous
cutting of prices that have characterized
former years and they predict that all
the big packers would Join m the com
bine. The following resolutions were then
passed by the packers:
Directors Will Be Permitted to Set
the Price of Fruit, Thus Prob
ably Eliminating Ruin
ous Competition.
Packers Agree to Buy Only
From Members of the
Association.

PTAXDIXG OF THE CLL'BS.
The second day of the forty-first annual
May festival of the San Francisco Schuet
zen Verein came to a close yesterday at
Shell Mound Park, Berkeley, with the
crowning of John Utschlg as shooting
king.
There was a large attendance of mem
bers and their friends. The day was ex
cellent for target shooting. In this in
stance the target was an eagle and the
object of the rival marksmen was to
ipluck some feature of his anatomy by
means of their buflets. for the purpose of
determining who was entitled to the title
of king. The target was made of wood
and the parts were fastened together by
means of wooden plugs, the location of
1 which was indicated by patches of white
paint. In order to gain a point it was nec
essary to knock off one of tho parts of th*j
bird, and in order to do so the fastening
plug had to be shattered with a, bullei.
The several parts were the head, tieck, a
ring pendant from the beak, the left and
rignt wings, the right and left claws, an
apple in one claw, a scepter in the other,
the tail and finally the body. During the
tiring on the outer members the head was
protected by a shield of plate iron
while the other features were being
shot at. After they had been shot
off the iron plate was removed and the
last target was the body. The man who
by his Ihot caused that to fall was de
clare*; king. .
There wtre seventy-two members In at
tendance. These Segan to shoot at 11
o'clock in thii morning. Before 12 o'clock
the members had fired three rounds and
five ot the prizes had been won. By 3
o'clock there was not a vestige of the bird
left- This was the earliest hour at which
the contest was brought to a close in the
history of the Verein. Utschig, besides
knocking down the body of the eagle, also
struck the head, neck and ring, but it re
quired the bullet of another marksman
to cause them to fall.
The winners of the prizes follow:
John Utschig. king, body target, prize
J75 and a gold medal; George Fein, crown;
Fritz Hensel, apple; Charles, Gellert,
pcepter; Herman Huber. head; John Hart
mann, right wing: Adolph Bertelsen, left
wing; S. Heino. right claw; F. Kock, left
claw; Johr. C. Wolier. tail.

CUPID TRIUMPHS IN
BATTLE WITH DEATH
Â»
THE tragic encounter which Fred J. Bortzmeyer had with a footpad en
Ellis street at midnight May ". in which the former neaTly lost his
life, will have a happy termination In a few clays. Bortzmeyer has
recovered from the. wound inflicted by the murderous thug who robbed
him of his money, and will leave next week for his home In Cincinnati. Be
fore leaving this city he will be married to Miss Grace Hale of San Diego,
to whom he was engaged.
Quite a romantic story attaches to the rough experience of Bortzmeyer
on the city's streets, darkened because of a parsimonious municipal admin
istration. "When the victim was brought to the Receiving Hospital the sur
geons held out no hope for his recovery and the supposedly dying man made
a pitiful request that* his parents in Cleveland, Ohio, and Miss Hale of
San Diego be notified of his condition. Miss Hale was having her trousseau
prepared for her approaching marriage to Bortzmeyer at the time and she
hurried to the bedside of her betrothed. She was only permitted to remain
with him for a few minutes. The young man seemed to revive at the
sight of his sweetheart. Though the patient was weak and his condition
demanded quiet ho had looked forward to the visit of his fiancee with so
much patience that the doctors consented to the meeting.
From that time Bortzmeyer began to Improve ranidly. It was thought
at first that a bedside marriage would take place, but the prospective groom
continued to improve and the idea was abandoned. Now that He has entirely
recovered from a wound that was regarded as fatal he and Mlas Hale will
be married with simple ceremony. The young couple will try to forget In
the felicities of married life the terrible experiences through which the hus
band-to-be passed.
"And then I was told to go home and
in my children's faces read my vocation.
My eldest son is now sludying to be a
Jesuit priest and It is my hope that I
may live long enough to see him In his
strange robes, watch his strange gestures
and receive from him absolution. That
is the story of my conversion. Is it not a
simple one?"
his father embodied in the precepts to
"hold your tongue, saw. wood, pay your
bills, mind your own business and take
your chances.": Not a bad religion after
all, he said, and one which he had trieO
never to forget. He reviewed his,educa
tion as an orphan under the direction of
two aunts, who strove to inculcate in him
the precepts of Methodism. Left alone
he studied as he pleased, read what he
liked and was led into a deep sympathy
for the mystical, the romantic and the
chivalric. fie loved music, painting,
architecture. , The charm of distance, he
said, was upon him.
He felt that Methodism was tco cold
and gradually he found himself fascinat
ed by the splendor or the Episcopal
church. He determined to become a min
ister and entered the Mount. Calvary The
ological Seminary of the Episcopal
church. He graduated and after ordina
tion as a minister served In several
churches, striving wherever he went . to
introduce ritualistic features and meeting
everywhere with stern and uncompromis
ing opposition.
"I felt that I was right." the speaker
said, "and I knew if I was right the
others of my faith were wrony. 1 felt that
there could not be one God for me and
another for another, and nowhere would
I compromise with what I -believed to be
right. At last I went as preacher in or
dinary to Trinity Church, the greatest
church in America. There I began the
study of my philosophy of faith; there
I felt the terrible position- of spiritual
and intellectual doubt. There I. first met
the counselor who led me the way I was
to follow. I went from Trinity to St.
Paul's in Buffalo and finally to the
Church of the Redeemer, at Bishop Pot
ter's request, in New York. â¢'
"At last I had time to read andâ to
doubt. At last I had the sanctuary for
which I had been seeking.. The sanctu
ary with its beauties of art and music
its stations of the cross, its lamps, Its
vestments, its confessionals and its
masses. And again my spiritual adviser,
Father Prendergast, a Jesuit priest, was
with me. I felt now that I must offer a
solution for the spiritual doubts which
presented themselves to me or accept the
answer which the Catholic Church had
given. I was called upon to answer that
desperately important question that is
before us all: .'Which road is the right
rgadr
"I was. In' the' hell of doubt. I was de
termined to find out and answer the ques
tion of identity, to tell for; myself which
church Is always, everywhere and for
everybody. And the answer to me was
the Catholic Church.' I took off my pur
ple stole and declared that. I had worn it
for the last time. ; I left my church and
went to. Europe, there to remain for some
time in an agony of unrest. My wife and
children -were dependent upon me utterly
for support. I could not make them beg
gars, and then in the blackest hour of mv
life I received a letter from my wife tell
ing me that she and our children had en
tered the Catholic church. '

accompany each of thn two trains. The
services of the Emalada Quartet have
been engaed, but the entire musical pro
gramme has not yet been arranged. The
next meeting of the committe,e will be
held at Pioneer Hall on May 24, at 8 p. m.
About two months ago the road passed
into. -the hands of the Southern Pacific
Company and became a part of the great
system. Isolated as a railroad, the Carson
and Colorado line is a property that
brings In less than Its operating expenses.
As a part of the Southern Pacific network
of steel rails it is of great value, and when
Huntington finishes his present scheme in
regard to this read if will give him a route
East- direct from Southern California over
the Central line, thereby ridding the com
pany of the disadvantages of several hun
dred miles of extra travel for both pas
senger and freight traffic.
.The Carson and Colorado road is narrow
gauge. Its terminus is at .Keeler, about
150 miles from Mojave. According to the
plans of Huntington. a broad gauge road
is to be built from Carson to Keeler and
connections to be made from that point to
Mojave. which means the building of an
additional road about 150 miles in length.
As the Colorado line is but 293 miles long,
the aggregate will be less than 450 miles,
some ninety miles shorter than the South
ern Pacific -road from Los Angeles to San
Francisco.
It is undoubtedly the Intention of Hunt
ington to extend the new road to Reno,
where it will joint the Central overland.
Altogether this is a shortening. of about
350 miles from the southern part of the
State to, the East over the Central line.
Collis P. Huntington will leave this city
for the East either to-day or to-morrow.
He will not go directly to New York, but
will stop over at Reno and make a hasty
investigation of the new northern terminal
of the lato adjunct of the Southern Pa
cific system, the Carson and Colorado rail
road, which runs from Carson City to
Keeler. in Southern California. '

Goodwin-Elliott Engagement.
FEW lecturers who have visited San
Francisco have held their audiences
in such interest and in such sym
pathy as did Henry Austin Adams last
night at Metropolitan Hall. The speaker
was elor;ucnt, theaudience was large and
receptive and the theme one of personal
interest to those who listened. "The Story
of My Conversion" was the subject chosen
by the lecturer, who told with the finished
arts of the orator the story of his conver
sion as a minister of the Episcopal ctfurch
to membership in the Catholic communion.
The speaker treated his subject.necessar
ily from a personal point of view, reciting
the incidents in his life which marked' his
religious, moral and intellectual culture.
He related the experience of his childhood,
told of his first intimations of religious
! feeling, dwelt upon those phases of his
I own character which led him to the ritual
j istic in religion and from the ritualistic
to that completion of formalism and au
thority which is represented in the Catho
lic church. ,
The theme was a dangerous one for an
orator seeking to hold his audience, and
its treatment, from the same point of
view, was daring; but the speaker was
brilliant In his discourse, changing from
humor to pathos in quick transition, now
winning the applause of his listeners by
some bright sally and again holding them
in the silence of sympathy by some touch
of pathos. In his consideraton for the
creed he had left, as well as for his feeling
for that which he had espoused, he won
also the good will of those who heard him.
The lecture was the first of a series, and
was given under the direction of the Cath
olic Truth Society of this city. F. J.
Kierce, vice president of the society, pre
sided. Before the speaker of the evening
was announcd Charles Hay gave a vocal
solo. He sang it so well, in a rich bary
tone voice, that the audience would not
cease persistent applause until an encore
was given, and oven then the listeners
were not satisfied. They were forced to
content themselves, however, and the
Aery Rev. Father J. J. Prendergast. Vicar
ueneral of San Francisco, stepped to the
front of the stage to Introduce the speaker
of the evening. *
"}} is to the Catholic Truth Society "
sajd the Vicar General, "that 1 ami
debted for the honor of introducing Henrv
Austln Adams, a finished scholarf an en
tertaining speaker and a master of the
themes he discusses. And even though I
say it to his face, he belongs to that heroic
race of confessors and martyrs who gave
up all in obedience to the command of
their conscience. He has made the sacri
fice of life a emoluments and enjoyments.
As the Protestant pastor of a wealthy
congregation, with a brilliant future be
fore him. he gave up all to become a
Catholic and a myman. And I predict now
that before he leaves us he will have thou
sands of friends and admirers."
With this introduction and a storm of
applause ringing in his ears, the speaker
of the night stepped to the front of the
stage. Time after time he essayed to be
gin, but the sound of his audience pre
vented. He could not have asked a more
Grand Opera-House.
The musical comedy. "The Lady Slavey,"
continues to be the attraction at the
TivolL
"The Wizard of the Nile" began its sixth
acd last work at the Tivoli Opera-house
last evening. The long run of this comic
opera shows that it met Â¦tfith popular fa
vor. Great preparations are being made
for the production of "The Three Guards
men," Â¦which has proved such a success in
Europe and the East. "Madeline; or. The
Magic Kiss" is also booked for the near
future.
Orpheum.
The Mignani family, who call them
selves the musical barbers-, are the fun
niest feature that has been seen in the
Orpheum for many a day, or night either.
They make music out of the chairs, the
ppittoons. the razors, the barber poles,
ihe shaving mugsâ in fact out of every
.old thins around tne shop. It seems like
sacrilege, however, to burlesque that
heart thrilling immortelle, the "Miserere."
The Wilson tjmily have been here before
ard do some new turns with the help of
ihe kid coons. Uartho. the premiere dan
peuse, is a new thir.tr on toes, with the
fchap*--liost "f figures and grace enough
for two. The old lavorites, Kendall, the
Newsboy quintet, the musical Klelsts,
Louise Gunning and I'lrlch. fill out a very
acceptable i-rugramme for the week.
End was thoroughly appreciated by the
sympathetic audience, for his good work
as i he hero, Frederick Ossian, Ernest
Hastings received four recalls at second
curtain Jeffrey Williams as the bluff,
line old Hiram CJreen, and Kdwin T.
Kmerv as the "unlickod cub of a. son."
Wrere heartily enjoyed. Miss Marie Howe
pave a clever study of Mrs. Stuart -Dodge,
the imperial's and aristocratic Philadel
phian. and Miss Irene Kverett. as her
daughter Miriam, sufficiently rilled her
part. Tho sweet seventeÂ«-ny Suzanne was
charmingly played by Miss I^aura. Crews.
and Miss Georgia Woodthrope was an ac
ceptable Mrs. Ossian. Howard Scott,
ileorge P. Webster and George Nichols
did good work in rheir resiwetive parts,
but the latter should study his Shackel
ford more faithfully.

Stored he began.
"1 had to come all the way to San Fran
cisco," he said, "to learn that I am a mar
tyr. If in my change of belief I lost
much, I gained more. If I lost a salary,
I gained what no dollar could ever buy
meâ peace of mind. Therefore I am no
martyr, but rather the privileged recip
ient of great favor. And I am to tell you
to-night the story of my conversion. It is
a delicate theme and a difficult one. that
involves the recital of personal experi
ences, mental impressions, sacred confi
dences that every sensitive, thinking,
honest man must honor and respect. I
am to speak of men of other faiths: men
whom I honor as old friends, whose sin
cerity and fidelity to the faith that Is in
them I revere, as I revere all that is good
in men.
"I am not hero to speak one word of re
proach to the splehdid men with whom I
have passed many years of cherished as
sociation. I am not, thank God. an ex
priest, and if I Â«m honored to-night by
hearers who are not Catholics I beg them
to listen in the same spirit in which I
speakâ with fairness and kindliness. I
know tco much of the noble men of the
Episcopal church, with whom I have
passed so many cherished years of asso
ciation. For their character and depth of
feeling I have absolute respect, and my
hope for them is that they, as I have
done, shall see the way. And in the story
of my conversion I beg of you to construe
nothing of bitterness in what I may say
of them. I honor them still as among my
dearest friends."
The speaker then traced in brief review
the incidents, experiences, conditions and
aspirations of his boyhood. He told of

When it adjourns the Republicans will be able to
show a good record for the session. Many important
measures, including the settlement of the monetary
standard and the adoption of wise regulations for cur
rency and banking, have been adopted Questions*
growing out of the annexation of Hawaii and Porto
Rico have been dealt with by the passage of bills
which will have the support of the people, and it is
known the Nicaragua canal bill would have been
passed had not the opposition managed to postpone it
by antagonizing the Hay-Pauncefote treaty. In fact,
despite that opposition, the bill may yet be taken up
and that important measure added to the record of
the work of the session.
So much good work done will make more con
spicuous than ever the failure of Congress to pass the
merchant marine. bill. The pledge in the platform of
1896 to promote American shipping is the only pledge
of that platform which remains unfulfilled. Neglect
on the part of Congress in that particular is difficult
to explain. With our rapidly increasing foreign trade
the need of an adequate merchant marine is felt by
every interest and every industry. Indeed the ship
ping bill might be well nigh regarded as an emer
gency measure, since every factor of the situation and
every tendency of commerce demands it.
The failure to pass the merchant marine bill con
stitutes the' single feature of the session Which 'can be
justly criticized. In every other respect the Repub
lican party can point with pride to what has been done
in the fulfillment of its campaign pledges, and when;
the representatives of the party return to their con
stituents they can rightly expect a full and cqrdiarin
dorscment of their service.

With the history of the movement to bring about
the undertaking of that important work the people are
familiar. Some time ago the California Legislature
appropriated $250,000 for the impounding of debris
in the upper rivers for the protection of miners and
farmers. To this the Federal Government added
$250,000. The California Debris Commission, com
posed of Government engineer?, has worked for a
long time to perfect a system by which the desired
work can be effectively accomplished. They finally
reported to the War Department a system which
would cost $800,000, or $300,000 more than- the com
bined appropriations. They declined to go ahead
with the work until the required money was in sight.
The delay which was thus threatened. would be t
serious injury, and accordingly efforts were made by
the California delegation in Congress to procure au
thority for the War Department to begin the work
with the money appropriated, the . deficiency to be
supplied by appropriations to be 'made hereafter.
That authority has now been given in the bill adoptci
by the House, and we have therefore good reason for
expecting that this work, so important to the people
of California, will soon be under way.
To the men who have achieved the good results
now in sight much credit is due. The strife between
the miners in the mountains and the people of the
valleys was hurtful to the best interests of Califor
nia in many ways, and it was a matter of general con
gratulation when they agreed upon a programme
which promised to open a way for hydraulic mining
while at, the same time securing the farms along the
streams from harm. The outlook is now encour
aging, and it is to be hoped there will be no further
hitch in the work.
A SATISFACTORY ending to a prolonged con
test seems to be assured in the "report from
Washington that the river and harbor bill re
cently passed by the House contains a resolution au
thonzing the beginning of work for the impounding
of the debris of our mountain rivers and the protec
tion of the valleys from injury by the operation of
mines.
THE DEBRIS RESOLUTION.
ABOUT this time look for reports of the Presi
dent's failing health. In 1893 the Democratic
opponents of Mr. Cleveland's sound money
policy were greatly cheered by reports that his health
was so bad that he would not last till the meeting of
Congress in December. Now it is discovered that
President McKiniey is suffering serious impairment
of health. The fact Is that he is in better health than
for years â far better than when he was in Congress.
He has the springy step and complexion of a boy.
In years he is in the prime of life, and is. getting his
physical dividends out of a life well ordered, prudent
and abstemious from his yot:th.
He has gone through the trials and crises of an un
usually active administration with the ease and facil
ity that conic of systematic business habits and a habit
of never fretting or worrying. What he can help he
helps, and what he c?n't help he dismisses without,
worry.
He is of stout and long-lived stock. His parents
and grandparents had an excellent vital record.
Length of days was the endowment of his forebears,
and he, more than others of his family circle, inherited
their physical and mental traits. The country is for
tunate in his physical strength and endurance and his
faculty of economizing and wisely using his energies.
He will long survive his second administration, to
enjoy the respect of his countrymen and to enjoy also
their establishment upon the firm foundation of pros
perity and progress builded in that industrial policy
with the promotion of which his name will be per
manently identified in cur history-
The country need take no stock in rumors of his
physical infirmity, or any impairment of his vigor.
THE PRESIDENT'S HEALTH.
TotaIs nS.flO9.31 $33,330,777
The increase is considerably over 100 per cent. In
Idnho the number of depositors has increased S50; in
Mor.tana from 7363 to 13-2.U; in Colorado from 18.53J
to 30.047; in Wyoming from 3026 to 6494. This
means that about 100 per cent more people were earn
ing a surplus of money in 1899 over and above what
was required in their daily life, and were adding to the
loan fund by depositing it in the banks. Of course
this means also that a vastly greater percentage were
earning what their daily needs require, which they
were not doing in 1894. These four States have an
2 SgTCgate population of 1.100,000.
The improved price of lead, copper, wool, beef and
mutton js responsible for this great increase in accu
mulations ar.d for its diffusion among the people.
And that increase in price is due to the country's gain
in consuming power, due to a revival of industry and
business even-where, and to the amazing increase in
our foreign trade.
As to our foreign trade, let the Western producer
consider its effect upon his welfare. He is not con
cerned so much as to whether what he produces is an
article of export as he is in the employment of home
labor in manufacturing for foreign demand, which la
bor is fed and clothed by what he produces, and is
cble to pay good prices for it, whereas five and six
years ago it could pay nothing.
In the nine months ending with March, 1900. we ex
ported four million dollars' worth of American loco
motives, against less than one million dollars' worth
in the corresponding months ending with March, 1894,
and two million eight hundred thousand dollars'
worth in the same period ending March, 1898.
This is given as an example of the extent to which
American labor is increasingly occupied in high grade
manufacturing to supply an increasing foreign de
mand.
A report recently made to his Government by the
British Agent and Consul General in Egypt says:
"Captain Johnstone, acting president of the railway
administration (Egyptian), reports the number of
breakdowns in our stock has been considerable, due
partly to heavy traffic and partly to inferiority <)f
stock. The engines purchased from America have
done well. The action of the board in ordering
locomotives snd v.asrcns (cars) from America has
been criticized. The orders arc partly due to the fa<Â«t
that American firms, while they are not in a position
to bid on more favorable term* than others on our
designs, invariably offer us engines or wagons built
to standard designs of their o'wn at lover prices and
less time; while Enghrh and other European
makers content themselves with tendering on bur de
signs, rot being in the habit of manufacturing to
standard designs of their own. In c?.fcs when time
and cost are of great importance, such an offer from
America cannot be passed by. On the other hand, the
long time required by competent English firms to
execute such orders is prohibitive. Three new loco
motives have arrived. and been taken into use on the
Kcnen-Assuan railway, and thirty wagons and three
more locomotives are on the way. All these are from
America, as they were urgently needed, and early de
liver;,- could not be obtained elsewhere."
An investigation into other lines of manufacture will
disclose a similar condition. It has arisen since 1806
as a part of the jrrest and general revival of energy
which has thrilled through every American interest.
It is a condition th2t should not be disturbed by re
versing the political situation and trying Colonel
Bryan's rule of thumb scheme of administration.
"T"*HE people of this country are very much dis-
I posed to look out for their own welfare. Ther
are averse to political experiments which may
bring a business reaction hurtful to industry, and arc
quite in the habit of letting well enough alone, until
they are <:r.ite sure that a change means something
better and not worse.
Colonel Bryan has just finished one of his cele

and fish of the State will convene on
Thursday morning at 10 o'clock, in the
rooms of the Olympic Gun Club. Kearny
street nnd Union Square avenue. The
delegates will continue in session for
three days. As previously announced,
the main object of the meeting will be to
outline a bill which will have the effect
of completely revising the game iind rish
laws of the State. Ihis will be submitted
to the next Legislature. Â»
One of the principal features of the pro
posed bill is the shortening? of tha open
season on all kinds of game now project
ed and to extend the protection of the'law
to those kinds not now mentioned In the
statutes. Another point to be rec-om
mended Is the limiting of the number of
game birds that a person may kill in one
day. The separation of the gamp and lish

XEW TORK CORRESPONDENT:
C C. CARLTON Herald Square
KEW TORK. REPRESENTATIVE:
STEPHEN 1 S. SMITH 30 Tr.bu^o Btii'drnq
_ _ T purpose Is to add to the recognized number of arts
one other, the art of actingâ that art which Voltaire
ill spoke of aa the most beautiful, the most difficult.
I I 1 the most rare. The great bulk of thinking and un-
I 1 1 thinking: people accept acting aa one of the arts. It
B a Is merely for a formal and official recognition of the
" â¢ fact that I ask. -
t Acting is a part of human nature. It Is originally
Nature's own method of education in the earliest
stages, and its purposeful organization is like that of any other
organization â an art.
Before we consider what Is the "differentia" or essential con
dition of a work of fine art, let me point out that art In any
of its phases does not deal with the original conception or crea
tion of Idea3. The Greek language, whence we derive the word,
had a completely different word to express the originator of
ideasâ the word creator or maker â the poet, as we call him
to this day. The functions of these two, the poet and the
artist, are entirely different, and their work can be dissociated.
Homer, the poet, conceived his thoughts and gave them
utterance, but the fashion in which he molded them In giving
them birth was a work of art. When others declaimed his
verses, so as to give forth their mighty roll and rhythm, the
fashion of their speech was the work of art. When, later on,
the sculptors modeled the forms of the gods and heroes as
Homer described them, translating the thoughts of the poet
Into graceful form whose Inner significance men could under-
Btandâ this was the work of the artist, too. It was no de
traction from the merit of the work, as a work of art, that the
sculptor set forth Homer's ideas and not his own.
Thus far we find applicable to acting the principles of art
laid down by two philosophic critics. Dr. Johnson, a poet of
the eighteenth century, imbued with all the culture and wis
dom of classic lore, the translator of Homer, the familiar of
the works of Plato and Aristotle, and M. Talne, Ihe exponent
of the modern scientific school of philosophy, a professor par
excellence of the plastic arts. We find that what is essential
to poetry, to music, to sculpture, to painting, is also essential
to acting.
Where, then, is the proof that acting is not one of the sl3ter
arts? What Is there, in it that disqualifies it from holding a
p!ace among them? To assert such a thing is to assume the
attitude of Cinderella's sisters in the fairy tale.
Now, Shakespeare wrot*. a play In which Richard III Is a
character. Can any one deny that this Is a work of art? Gar
rJck In his playing appeared on the stage in such wise that
those who Baw him knew that the man before them waa the.
man Garrlck. while at the same time he seemed by many signs
and In many ways to be the Image, copy, what you will, of
Shakespeare's Richard III. though Garrlck gave his Shake
speare unadulterated with Clbber. Yet Garrick's work In pro
ducing this Impression was, we are to be told, not a work of
art. Why It was not so I leave to those to say who assert that
acting- is not an art.
Kow as to endurance of expression. Is It to be seriously set
forth by any one as an argument that art ceases to be art be
cause Its work does not endure? The life of all things of the
Â¦world Is bounded by time and the many accidents and disasters
which are time's agents of destruction. Surely of all the ma
terials in which art can work, marble, brick and metal are thÂ»
most enduring, and yet thÂ» works wrought In them pass away.
With the Parthenon and the Colosseum In ruins and the great
temples of the gods obliterated; with the works of Praxiteles
and Phidias, almost unseen by any eye In their perfect beauty:
with the wilderness of Benvenuto's marvels, mainly, long ago
reduced to chaos In the melting pot; with Apelles a name, and
even the names of the host of his compeers forgotten, who la
to say that works of art need Immortality In order that tha
labor to which they are due may be classed as art?
Where are now those miRhty works of man's art which cams
to be known as the "Seven Wonders of the World?" WherÂ©
is the mighty city of Babylon, with Its walls and temples and
gardens? Gone. Where la the mighty statue of Olympian
Jove, the triumph of Phidias? Gone. Where is the temple of
Diana? Gone. Where Is the mausoleum of Artemisia? Gone.
Where is the Pharos of Alexandria? Gone. Where Is the
Colossus of Rhodes? Gone. Aye, and gone with them millions
of art works, by myriads of workers In countless agesâ men
now nameleas, but once full of honor, and whose work was and
is placed in the existing category of the arts.
Acting may be evanescent. It may work in the media of
common nature; it may be mimetic like the other arts- it mnv
not create any more than does the astronomer or the nafiiMi
1st, but it can live and can add to the turn of human know -
edge In the ever-varying study of man's nature hv man and
its work can. like the six out of the seven wonders at t'hci
world, exist as a great memory. M ln *
Acting as a Fine Art.
By Henry Irving.
The Call desires to go upon record in the most positive manner, .upon knowledge
obtained through the exertion of all the resources at command of a newspaper, that there
has been and is no bubonic plague in San Francisco. But anewspaper cannot alone undo the
harm that is being done. There must be immediate action by the mercantile and business
classes, to secure the abundant scientific testimony at hand. There arc men here of emi
nence in the medical world who are known and trusted far abroad. Their action and ex
pression should be secured immediately. And when they have spoken let all official au
thority be brought into action to purge the city's good name of the harmful stain that has
fallen upon it. The State Board of Health has already taken action and has officially
notified the State Boards throughout the Union that the plague is not here. This is offi
cial action reliable and satisfactory. Let it be followed up by such action as shall secure
the co-operation of the Federal authorities in putting an end to the needless and cause
less panic which exists at a distance. Here there is no alarm, panic or disturbance in
Chinatown or elsewhere.
The time has come for some positive action on the part of the people of this city.
We have here scientific physicians, with the caution and modesty which accompany that
character. Theyare not compelled to eke out an income by seeking politicalposition and
its emoluments. They have a regard for their own professional reputation and for the wel
fare of this city. Their services should be secured to settle at once this highly vital matter.
Since the first heedless scare of last March the newspapers here have kept a close watch
upon the matter, with able scientific assistance, and have been ready at the appearance of
danger to frankly disclose all the facts. They have found no occasion to make any dis
closure, further than that the plague is not here. The pathological pecu
liarities of common disease among Asiatics are not known to American practitioners,
except to the few who practice among that race. There are" a Jew physicians of ap
proved scientific standing here who have Asiatics among their clientele, and so far not
one of them has given his testimony to the existence of a single case of plague here.V Â¦
It is a matter of such supreme seriousness to the whole State as to- dwarf all other
matters. The county organization of physicians has refused to indorse the statements
heretofore made that plague is here. Their action was based upon positive knowledge
derived from the professional contacts of members of the society. On top of this comes
the admission of the State Board of Health itself that there is no plague here. ;
The issue now is, how to remove the impression that has been unfortunately pro
pagated abroad, to the immeasurable injury of California and to the probable loss of a
whole year's commerce.
THE Gity Board of Health has involved San Francisco in another bubonic plague
scare, which, from all the facts known, we are able to denounce as equally groundless
with* that which originated in the same source last March.
This latest alarm began with the case of a Chinese who was under treatment- for
malarial fever, accompanied,. in its acute stage, by swelling of the glands. In that stage
his case came under cognizance of some one connected with the Board of Health, and the
conclusion was jumped at that he had. bubonic, plague. The subsequent proceedings fol
lowed. Inoculation was decided upon, and the whole Asiatic population of the city has
been put under duress to submit to the serum treatment at the : hands of all sorts of em
ployes of the Board of Health. There are vague reports of from two to eight cases of the
plague, none located nor identified, and the report of each attended by the information
I that the victims were also suffering from other diseases previous to the assumed presence
j of the capital ailment. This treatment of the matter has. resulted in a well developed
i panic outside of San Francisco, causing a distinct embargo upon our commerce and a
i shadow upon the export trade and the prosperity of the whole State for the entire year.

WILL TAP MODESTO
He Dscides Against the Claim of
Marshall Field & Co. of
Chicago.
United States Circuit Judge Morrow, sit
ting with Judges Gilbert and Hawley as
the United States Circuit Court of Ap
peals, handed down a decision yesterday
that will be read with interest all over the
United States by business men, for It lays
down the law on a mooted point in the re
lations between debtor, and creditor.
Tl;e case is that of Edward W. Forgy,
trustee of the estate of Fixen & Co., bank
rupt, vs. Marshall Field & Co., of Chicago.
The point at issue was whether a creditor,
receiving from a debtor a payment on ac
count in the ordinary course of business
within four months prior to the debtor
going into insolvency, was to be debarred
from asserting his claim because of such
payment.
Judge Morrow's decision was to the ef
fect that in such a case the creditor, Mar
s-hall Field & Co.. could have elected to
turn in the payment that was made to
them on account by the bankrupt and
take their chances with the other cred
itors, or keep the money that was paid
and receive nothing further from the
bankrupt estate. The judgment of the
lower court was accordingly reversed and
the cause remanded with directions to dis
allow the entire claim of Marshall Field
& Co. Judges Gilbert and Hawley con
curred in the decision.
Opinions In other cases v^ere handed

reversed and cause remanded for further

CREDITORS WARNED
BY JUDGE MORROW
There are two steamers named Victoria
on this coast. Both of them have served
as United States transports and both of
them were unlucky. The British steamer
Victoria arrived in port yesterday after
having taken seven months to make thy
round trip to Manila, while the American
steamer Victoria lost R5 out of 40J head of
horses a few days after she railed and had
to put back to Seattle :n distress.
The British steamer Victoria sailed from
here on October 16. 1S&9, with a carpi of
supplies for the army In Manila. When
about haif her Journey had been com
pleted her shaft broke. She drifted around
in a.hoipless condition for several days
until sail could be got on her and then
slow progress was made toward Guam.
Nothing was heard from the Victoria for
nearly iwo momhs. Just as everybody
was Betting anxious the news came that
she had reached Guam in safety and had
started for Manila on Decernoer 25 in tow
0/ the naval collier Brutus. It was the
Brutus that towed the monitor Monterey
from San Francisco to Manila, so she had
no diihculty In handling the transport.
Koth vessels reached Manila on March 14
last and the work of discharging the Vic
toria's cargo was at once beKun.
As soon as the transport was discharged
the Brutus took hold or.ee more and towed
her to Hongkong. A new shaft was put
In and the Victoria came back to San
Francisco. It took her 23 days to make
the run from Nagasaki. She will he re
leased by the Government to-day and will
go into the Puget Sound trade.
The American steamer Victoria, after
her disaster off Flattery, came here and
loaded for Manila. She made the re
mainder of the voyage without mishap
and is now In the trade between Seattle
and the Orient.
The transport Lawton will probably get
away for Seattle to-morrow. On her ar
rival Phe will take aboard a consignment
of United States troops for the various
camps in Alaska. When that work Is ac
complished she will go to Manila to be
placed In the inter-is'.and irade.
The transport Sherman wlil get away
June 1 for Manila. Sho will, take with her
BOO of the recruits now at the Presidio.

says that the comparison of Its spectrurh
with that of argon "may point to the
conclusion that argen Is a mixture." Re
cently. In 1S98, four new gase* were ob
tained from argon. They were called
krypton, neon, metargon and xenon, and
are considered by their discoverers. Ram
say and Travers. elementary substances.
Metargon was first seen as a white solid
In the evaporation of liquid argon, but
little more than the name Is known oC
any of them.
At about the same time Brush an
nounced the discovery of a substance
which was supposed to be a new gas.
From Its very remarkable properties tt
received. the name "etherlon. It was ob
tained by highly exhausting soda gla?s.
Its conducting power, at this high ex
haustion, wai twenty times that of hy.
drosen. and It was concluded that It must
be ten thousand times as light as hydro
gen. No further account of It has been
published, although Crookes has suggest
ed that It may be very highly exhausted
water vapor.
The> discovery of new pubstancen In such
rapid succession does not tend to the sim
plification of ideas: and we may hope that
the time will come when Investigation, In
stead of multiplying elements, will suc
ceed In reducing some of those substance^
that are now considered elementary to>
simpler form*. ,.
Other New Gases.
"We appear to be In the presence of the
vera causa." not of two or three, but of
many of the lines which so far have been
classed as unknown by students both of
solar and stellar chemistry. And If this!
be confirmed we are evidently In thw
presence of a new order of gases of the
highest importance to celestial chemistry,
though perhaps thÂ«Â»y may be of small
practical value to chemists, because their
compounds and associated elements are
for the most part hidden deep in the
earth's Interior."
Helium was very difficult to liquefy and
was condensed by Dewar only by placinc
It in liquid hydrogen. Its boiling point
has not been determined, but Is probably
near that of hydrogen. It forms a liquid
which Is colorless In small quantity.
Large quantities have not been obtained.
Helium Is probably widely distributed in
very small quantities and seldom free. It
Is lighter than any known gas except hy
drogen, and for this reason and because
of Its inertness It Is not found In the at
mosphere. It would fly off Into space.
the earth, although some of them aro
found In the spectra of other stars. The
moat prominent of these lines Is a bright
yellow line recurring very close to the
yellow lines due to sodium. This line Is
known as D3, and was ascribed to the un
known element In question, which, from,
its existence In the sun was called helium.
Th" ppectrum of the new gas was care
fully compared with that of argon, and
Crookes determined by exact measure
ment that the bright yellow line wa3
identical with the line D3. Then Lockyer.
who had discovered the D3 line in 1863 and
named the substance producing it helium,
prepared some of the jras from minerals,
and concluded from his observations that
the nature of the gases obtained was not
simple and "that the gases composing the
mixtures are by no means the only ones
we may hope to obtain." There seemed
reason to expect the discovery of other
gases of a similar nature.
Â¦ Further search for compounds of argon
led to a new discovery. It had been found
that a certain rare mineral, a compound
of uranium, could be made to produce a
gas supposed to be nitrogen. The reported
action of this g-as led Ramsay to examine
the mineral in question, and he obtained
a gas which proved to be a mixture of
argon and helium.
Helium Is a gas which had up to that
time been considered either as entirely
absent from the earth or as contained In
chemical combination far out of reach In
the intcrlcr.i although It was known to
exist In the sun, from which It derived
Its name.
When the sun is totally eclipsed there
appears a bright, flaming envelope of
burning? gases called the chromosphere,
which is usually masked by the much
greater brightness of the body of the sun.
TTils chromosphere has been an object of
great interest to astronomers since It was
first shown by the telescope, and Its ap
pearance has bÂ«en observed, drawn anil
photographed at every opportunity. This
can be done only during an eclipse. It
has also been observed by means of the
spectroscope, and a number of lines have
been found which did - not correspond to
those given by any substance known upon
Helium.
There is evidence both for and airalnst the
hypothesis that argon is a mixture â for. owini?
to Mr. Crookes* observations of the dual char
acter of the spectrum; against, because of
Professor OIoxewols.ru statement that it has
a definite melting point, a definite boiling point
and a definite critical temperature and prfÂ»
sure; and tx'cause on compr^Ksinjc The ptr.* in
presence of its liquid, pressure remains sen
sibly constant until all *cas has condensed to
liquid. â¢ â¢ â¢ The results may be taken as
affording additional confirmation of the con
clusion that arson is a definite, hitherto un
known constituent of the atmosphere, and that
It has been isolated in a slate very closely ap
proaching to purity.
Argon was found to have a bolllnsr point
of â 1S7 degrees C, and froze at â lSd de
grees C, in white crystals. It Is some
what soluble In water, but attempts to
jnake It combine chemically with nearly
forty different substances failed. It was
this Inertness that gave it the name
argon.
The question then arose. What Is the
actual evidence that the substance re
maining after the removal from air of the
known substances, except nitrogen. Is all
of one kind? Cavendish, experimenting
with air more than 100 years ago. got a
small residue, and concluded that "if
there is any part of the phloglsticated air
of our atmosphere which differs from the
rest and cannot be reduced to nitrous
acid, we may safely conclude that it Is not
more than 1-120 part of the whole." With
thia conclusion he appears to have been
satisfied, although probably this small
part contained the gas now called argon.
Ramsay and Rayleigh obtained portions
from air by different methods, measured
the density and examined the spectrum.
The spectrum, that most delicate of all
tests, showed a substance which certainly
was not nitrogen, but it was for some
time doubtful whether It was an element,
a compound or a mixture. Samples of the
new gas were very carefully examined by
Crookes and the snectrum was found to
present some peculiarities. The "physical
constants," as they are called, were de
termined by Olozewokl. There was evi
dence on both sides.
When the discrepancy of weights was first
encountered attempts were naturally made to
explain it by contamination with known im
purities. Of these the most likely appeared
to be hydrogen, present in the lighter gas. â¢
â¢ â¢ But inasmuch as the Intentional Intro
duction of hydrogen Into the heavier gao.
afterward treated In thf Â«amÂ» -way, had no
effect upon Its weight, thia explanation had
to be abandoned.
A little less than five years ago it was
reported to the Royal Society by Ramsay
and Lord Rayleigh that a new gas had
been discovered in the atmosphere. The
small quantity In which it occurred and
Its remarkable reluctance to unite with
other elements were the reasons for Its
having remained so long unrecognized,
although it was probably obtained in a
somewnat Impure state more than a cen
tury ago.
Nitrogen, when extracted chemically
from Us compounds. Is about hi per cent
lighter than the nitrogen obtained from
air. This was marked by the experi
menters, and In Ramsay's words:

RECENT SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES.
SOMETHING like the scenes when
the first army transports were sniV
ing. soldier laden, for the Philip
pines, was that of yesterday after
noon nt the Pacific dock when the steam
sh'p ZealandJa pulled out for Nome fairly
alive with excited humanity, all her Hags
fly!ng and her whistles blowing a shrill
good-by in response to the various cries
and hat and handkerchief waving of the
thousands of men, women and children,
relative?, frirnds and curious, gathered
on the deck from which she sailed ana
the Broadway dor*k, opposite. Laughter,
tears, sobs and cheers expressed the va
rious emotions of those in the throng.
This, the largest steamer thus far sent
to Nome, carried the largest number of
people that yet has gone at one time.
There were 730 passengers and a crew of
120 aboard, S70 souls in alL In the crowd
gay youth and hoary old age brushed
together. Many women were aboard,
most of thc-m going without male protec
tion to "5fek their fortunes In the great
est mining camp of the time.'.
The dock from which the Zealandia
Milled would have been so jammed with
rpectators that the passengers would
have found it almost impossible to get
aboard had not entrance been restricted.
The overflow tilled the space on the pea
wall, and the Broadway dock carried a
large throng.
Gets Away on Time.
Assistant Superintendent L. A. Phillips
of the Alaska Exploration Company, un
der whose flag the steamer 3ai!ed, and
the company's secretary, S. W, Saalburij,
were there to superintend the departure
of the vessel. fc>ne grot away at 3:15 p.
m.. only a quarter ot an hour later than
the schedule time. Several passengers
came near getting left. One belated
passenger was rowed out to the ship Just
as she backed into the stream ana was
hauled aboard.
The most interesting passengers on the
rhip were an aged couplei pioneers of
California. They were going to Alaska
to "begin life anew," as the snowy-head
ed husband put it. Varun Westcou. 75
vears of age. of Soledad, and Helen M.
\Vestcott, his wife, also 75, found their
way. hand elapsed in hand, through the
,'r-nV*- crowd and on to the ship, where
thev swmed to take all the eager inter-
I est exhibited by younger people in the
j getting away of the ship.
i "I'm Roiiig up there to mine," said the
1 old man, his eyes bright with expec
Â¦ tuncy. "I mined in California In '43.
i and I haven't forgotten how. We've got
i as complete an outfit as anybody going
up."
"We want to be where the excitement
is," piped the old lady, "and that's why
we're going up there."
Has a Political Mission.
Edward McGettlgan, formerly a mem
ber of the Democratic State Central Com
mittee, for years in political control of
i the Mare Island navy yard and known
i among politicians from one end of Cali
! fornia to the other, was one of the pas
i sengers, his son Lewis accompanying him.
Air. McGettlgan goes as the representa
tive of the wholesale liquor house which
he hart represented for years, but It is
said he has another mission, which is to
aid in fulfilling the political aspirations
! of his friend, Tom Geary of Santa Itosa
I The ex-Congressman sailed nearly two
weeks ap,o for Nome, and it is said that
In addition to a desire to make mnncv
practicing law there he has an ambition
i to represent the greater Alaska In the
National House of Representatives. Cam
paigning in Air ska. where it sometimes
tnkeH a month or more to go from one
principal town to another, will be quite
a riifferer.t thing from what it is here,
and the ofHec seeker will bo puzzled as to
where to begin and -where end.
H. I*. Byrne, the capitalist, and Charles
Watson of the Standard Oil Company
Ex-Superior Judge Ansel Smith and J.
B. McNamara. a sporting man of Stock
ton, sailed with the crowd. Mrs. Polsky
and her daughter of the same town went
on the Zenlandia to seek fortune in Nome.
Jim Dearin of O'Donnell & Dearin, the
Grant-avenue sa'oon men, went along, as
did Billy Fitzererald. the politician, who
will probably start a pure-politics club in
Nome with a picture of Chris Buckley
over the door as a source of inspiration.
Twenty-eight Chinese cooks employed
by the company were at the dock ready to
sail, but they did not get away. They re
fused to submit to vaccination ordered by
the Health Board and were not allowed to
go aboard. These men were employed at
tG5 a month each. The company would
have preferred white cooks at even better
wages, but white men cannot be depend
ed on because they quit work and rush to
the scene cf every new mining excif
ment. leaving the company In the lurch.
Another force of cooks will be secured
and sent up on the Humboldt Wednesday
week.
Chinese Cooks Left Behind.
Vincent Hook, formerly Sheriff of Con
tra Costa County, and Mitchell Phillips
of San Jose, at one time chief stevedore
for the Pacific Mail Steamship Company
in this city, wt-re also among the passen
gers. Hook hns claims at Nome and Phil
lips represents a mining anrl trading com
pany for which 200 tons of machinery
were shipped on another boat. He took
seven mon with him.
Consciousness of 'ner enterprise seemed
to rush suddenly back to Mrs. Rosenberg
at these words. She sprang to her feet,
brushed the hair from her eyes and
dashed up the gangplank before her
friends could even shake hands with her.
When the steamer pulled out she stood at
the rail on the hurricane deck waving her
handkerchief oral smiling.
"Look here/.' exclaimed Assistant Su
perintendent Phillips, tapping her on the
shoulder. '"Do you know this boat leaves
in three minutes and that if you don't get
aboard you won't get to Nome?"
Woman Passenger F.iints.
The excitement and close atmosphere
on the dock overcame Mrs. Rosenberg,
who goes to Nome to start a swell restau
rant, and a few minutes before the boat
pulied out she fell in a faint amidst a
party cf friends on the dock. They Ira
7Â»ecilately tried to revive hr?r, and though
she soon regained consciousness sne
seemed in n port of a stupor and unaware
of what was going on jirour.il her.
Cnptnin I. N*. llibfcnrd, general super
intendent for the A. K. Company; H. A.
Brigham, superintendent of its mining de
partment, and W. H. Dohrmann. its chief
accountant nt St. Michael, sailed on the
Zealandia.
went along, the former to Invest In mines,
the latter to represent his company.
Phil Howell, the bookmaker; Sara Dan
nenbaum and Mose Selig formed part of
the crowd that left on the ship. Howell
took along n big portable house with tent
auxiliaries and will start a general sport
ing resort there. Dannenbaum and Selig
will embark in the cigar business. The
party sat on a lifebcat as the ship pulleu
out and drnnk lo their friends from a
bottle of champagne, Pannenbaum wav
ing an American flag the while.

N'KW TORS, May 21. -Th* stock market was
soft from the outset to-day and yielded read
ily to the assault of the bears. There was
practically no buying demand of any Import
ance perceptible and prlrÂ«** lost ground pretty
mea/iily all day, pven on a light volume of
tradlnjf. Late in the afternoon Third Avenue
made a â¢Jdiie:i advance of Â« point? and caused
come uneaFineFs among the rÂ«)m shorts, who
bought irj-.wJerately to cover. But the rally was
ineipninVarit outside of Metropolitan. Brooklyn
Tranrit, Sugar and Tobacco. The sudden up
ward mo\ement in Third Avenue was unex
plained, except by last week's move to secure
the receiver ajÂ»d the progress being mad* In
the lx*t termer.t of the system. The long out
rtanding Fhort interest in tne was aimed
at by the advanÂ«v>. The heaviness of th? mar
ket durinc the day reflected tr-Â» keen disap
pointment ovrr the failure of last week's en
couraging developments to attract any out
eide demand. It was poon evident that Lon
&<yn especially had been looked to hopefully
to take up American rtocks and the early
Tnorning new* from that quarter showing <1*?
cl'aes for the International stocks was a dis
appointment. The 6ales for London account
were not in large volume, but their effect was
decisive and pÂ«on ovcrrjme the strength In
the few *j.ecia.ltip* which attempted to make
riead^vny agaln'.t the tide. It was clear that
speculator* who bought stock late lsÂ«t week
counted upon London taking thÂ°m off their
hands after that market had subsided from
Itf hj-Ftejical outburst over the relief of Ma
:â¢ r. .! >-'. But I^ondon shared with the Con
tinental bourse* a moo^i nf depression. In
ternational houÂ«eÂ« in Wall Ftrept attributed
this to disappointment over th<Â» denial of the
report that President Kruger had made hum
b!e advances for peace mid Berlin advices re- I
ported fears of an outbreak between Ku5Â»Ia Â¦
and Japan. In New York the prÂ»nÂ«rÂ«rp and
the Pariftr-ji were the Tim to fhoir acute, eicn!"
at weakness, but ultimately practically all of
the active rallm^d FtockÂ« fell from 1 to 2
points below Saturday's close. Sucar roue at
the opening on the announcement of advances
In the price of refined, but it was Bold In
eucn volume and with euch confidence that It
fell into weakness with the rest of the mar
ket. The weakness In the wheat and cotton
markets was not without effect In Wall street.
Bonds were much better e-jstalned relatively
than ctocke. though there were weak spots In
tiie list. The accumulation of Idle funds seek
ing investment Ik making some slight lxnpres

NEW YORK. May 21.-The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London .financial cablegram says:
The market* to-day were very disappointing:,
the public having failed to come In despite the
Inspiration of the news from Mafeklng. Deal
era I had loaded up with stocks, particularly
American*; in anticipation of public buying,
but getting no response they realized to-day
with the result of producing general heaviness.
Business also was light. The weakness In
Americans was accentuated by New York's
failure to support these securities and the stale
rumors about the plague in San Francisco.
Copper nhares were good, affected by the rise
In the price of the metal, but they relapsed in
sympathy with the fall In Americans. Consols
were depressed by the new talk of another
war loan. The Bank of England received Â£5000
in gold from Malta and an Australian parcel
of Â£1SO,W)O arrived, but will not be available
for asveral days.

The Search Warrant Case Against
Mrs. Louise Kelso
by Judge Cabaniss.
Mrs. Annette Louise Harbidge-Maris
tany, ex-proprietor of the Alameda Cloak
House, had another point scored against
her In the legal fight with Mrs. Louise
Kelso, or Mrs. Laura Walsh, and Mary
Donnelly, or Mrs! Mary Hilborn. She lost
the search warrant case in Judge Ca
baniss' court Saturday against Mrs. Hil
born and yesterday she lost the search
warrant case against Mrs. Kelso.
Mrs. Kelso was accused of stealing
about $450 worth of goods from the Ala
meda store during Mrs. Maristany's ab
sence in the East. When Mrs. Maristany
left for the East she put Mrs. Hilborn
in charge of the shop and Mrs. Walsh in
charge of the house. Mr. Maristany being
general boss. Mrs. Maristany alleged
that after her departure Mrs. Kelso and
Mrs. Hilborn poisoned her husband's mind
against her and got him to sell off the
stock and they took -advantage of the op
portunity to enrich themselves.
Mrs. Kelso testified that all of the arti
cles recovered from her rooms at 1520
Geary street were given her by Mr. Maris
tany, because she had not received any
money for her six weeks' services. Miss
Miller, a friend of Mrs. Kelso. testified
that she saw Mr. Maristany gfive Mrs.
Kelso several articles of crockery ware
in dispute, and Mrs. Hilborn calmly testi
fied that she saw Maristany give Mrs.
Kelso all of the other valuable articles,
including cloth, skirts, waists, suits and
trimmings. Maristany got excited and
called Mrs. Hilborn a liar. He was repri
manded by the Judge and said no more.
The Judge, after listening to the recrim
inations among the women, said the case
was too complicated for him, as there
was apparently too much lying and he
would aismiss it, advising the parties to
go into the civil courts.
Mrs. Kelso had given Attorney Dinkel
spiel, who represented her, a bill of sale
for the goods in payment of his fee, and
Mrs. Maristany's attorney at once applied
for a writ of replex'in. The matter was
adjusted by Judge Cabaniss allowing Mrs.
Maristany to take an inventory of the
goods so that she would know what they
were in any subsequent proceedings;
Uinkelspiel took the two cases away with
him. agreeing to keep them Intact until
the matter was disposed of. He threat
ened to have Mrs. Maristany indicted by
the Federal Grand Jury for opening let
ters addressed to Mrs. Kelso, which were
found in Mrs. Maristany's possession.
SECOND POINT SCORED
AGAINST MRS. MARISTANY
The widow, who calls herself Caroline L.
Dutra, has petitioned the Superior Court
for letters testamentary in the estate. She
alleges that the property left by him is
Â¦worth about $2100. The heirs are. the
widow and three small children.
Sampson was an old resident of JSden
township, where he was prominent in
business and politics. He was one of the
best known members of the Portuguese
Union of San I-eandro. It was decided by
a Coroner's iury that he was insane when
he took his life.
"Death Is preferable to life In misery,"
according to the last will and testament
of Joseph Sampson, the Ashland farmer
who committed suicide several days ago
by hanging himself to the rafters of his
barn. The will, which is short., was writ
ten by Sampson a few hours before he
took his life. It is written with an in
delible pencil on a scrap of note paper
and shows the disordered condition of
Sampson's mind when he executed the
document. The strange instrument reads
as follows:
"Death is preferable to life in misery,
but I blame no one other than myself.
"Whatever 1 may leave, give to my wife
and children. My carcass give to medicos
if they will accept of it. May God for
give and have mercy unto me, also all of
those against whom I have acted, as I
do forgive everyone."
J. S. SAMPSON or Dutra sometimes.
"Peace and innocence sleep while evil
roams."

The same measures will be taken in regard
to the children as soon as an ordinance
can be prepared to cover their case.
The contest for the office of principal of
the Tompkins School, vice Professor Ed
win Markham, caused considerable dls
cussion. The recommendation of the
classification committee that J. C. Gilson
be appointed to the position was presented
to the board, but when it came to a vote
Directors Price, Powell, Russ, Randolph
and Wakefield, who voted for the ap
pointment of Gilson, were opposed by a
like numberâ Directors Gray, Knox, Men
ges, Wilcox and Reddington. The vote
was a tie and no principal was elected.
Those who voted against Gilson declared
that they did so because they did not
want to go on record against Miss Wal
ton, another aspirant for the position.
Gilson's supporters explained their posi
tion by saying that they were opposed
to women principals in schools where
there are more than six grades.

FALLS FORTY
FEET AND IS
STILL ALIVE
Girl Drops to the Bottom
of a Well in Dimond
Canyon.
Hauled Out by Picnickers Who
Luckily Hear Her Cries for As
sistance â Her Injuries Are
Not Serious.
Oakland Office San Francico Call,
1118 Broadway, May 21.
While picnicking in Dir.iond Canyon yes
terday Mary Viera, 16 years old, residing
at Elmhurst, stepped Into an abandoned
dry well and fell forty feet to the bottom,
just missing a plank which was sticking
up in the well.
That the girl was not instantly killed
was considered a miracle by her rescuers,
who were attracted by the faint cries for
assistance which they heard. She was
very badly bruised and cut, but suffered
no serious external injury. After the girl
had been hauled out of the pit she fainted,
but up to that time she had maintained
her presence of mind sufficiently to assist
the rescuing party in their work.
"Walter Dyke, a clerkin the freight office
of the Southern Pacific Company in San
Francisco, his wife and some friends were
near the well at the time of the accident.
They did not see the girl fall, but were
close enough to hear her screams, which
came faintly from the bottom of the well.
Dyke was lowered into the well, and ihe
fastened the rope about the girl so she
could be drawn up. Then the party, rein
forced by other picnickers in the canyon,
dragged Dyke out. The girl was not af
fected by the shock until after she was
?afe above ground. Then, under the ner
vous strain, she collapsed. The physicians
in attendance upon Miss Viera do not be
lieve she sustained any severe internal In
juries, although there is a possibility that
the shock may result more seriously than
now seems probable.
COUNCIL BARS OUT
THE SURETY COMPANY
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
â¢ 111S Broadway, May 21.
The City Council decided to-night that
the Fidelity and Deposit Company of
Maryland shall no longer be allowed to
act as surety for any employe of the city
of Oakland. This action was taken ba
cause of the stand of the company with
regard to its alleged liability on a bond
furnished to the city by Roland W. Snow
while he was Auditor and ex-offlclo As
sessor.
When suit was filed against Snow and
his sureties for the collection of money
alleged to have been Illegally withheld,
the Fidelity and Deposit Company filed
an answer declaring irresponsibility in the
matter. It was stated that as the clty
was in the possession of nothing to. show
that such a bond ever existed the surety
company refused to be considered a party
to the suit. This action was taken be
cause It was learned that the bond fur
nished the city had been lost.
A resolution was introduced by Council
man Rowe, declaring the bonds forfeited
of any city official whose surety was the
Fidelity and Deposit Company of Mary
land and prohibiting the company from
again appearing on the bond of an em
ploye of the city* of Oakland. The reso
lution was adopted unanimously.
Councilman Cuvelller submitted a report
of his conference with A. W. Von Schmidt
of the 1 Lake .Tahoe and San Francisco
Water Works with regard to a water sup
ply for Oakland. He said that the city of
San Francisco would probably purchase
the rights of the water company and this
city could purchase water at a reasonable
rate from the city across the bay. Oak
land would be directly on the pipe line
and might easily be supplied.

WARRING PARENTS AND

After having their fill of Horst the
swarm made it warm for a trotting horse
belonging to Henry Wlchman, which was
tied in a lot a block away from the scene
of the first onslaught. The frantic ef
forts of the .horse to shake the bees off
attracted the attention of the coachman.
Fred Schrieber, who tri^d to assist the
animal with the business^nd of a broom.
Schrieber saw things coming his way then
and made tracks for the barn, receiving
a number of remembrances from the bees
himself.
The unfortunate's face, neck and head
swelled to immense proportions after the
encounter. He was unable to see, as his
eyes were closed, his brother having to
lead him home. A physician was sum
moned to attend the wounds and prescribe
against bloodpoisonlng.
"It must have been over an hour that I
fought before attracting my brother's at
tention," said Horst to-day. "I don't
know what would have happened If as
sistance-hadn't reached me."
The mask slipped off at a critical time,
exposing his face to the attacks of the
bees. Thousands alighted on his flesh and
sent their deadly little weapons home.
Horst tried to brush the insects off with
his gloved hands, throwing sand on them
and running through brush, but they kept
a-comlng. Finally, after a prolonged
light, Gustave. an elder brother, discov
ered Horst'3 plight. Directing him to a
hose, he turned a strong stream of water
on his brother and soon had the bees
beaten off.
Horst is interested In bees and puts In
his leisure time on the several swarms
which compose his apiary. He prepared
yesterday to remove the honey from one
of the hives. He was fully protected
against the objections of the bees, hav
ing provided himself with canvas cloth
ing and a mask for the face. All would
have gone well with him if an unforeseen
accident had not occurred.
ALAMEDA. May 21. â For over an hour
yesterday afternoon young Harry Horst
battled with a swarm of bees at his api
ary, 902 Santa Clara avenue, and before
he finally got rid of the enraged Insects
had been rendered blind by their stings.
The same bees that attacked Horst
alighted on a valuable horse and when
the coachman, Fred Schrieber, attempted
to drive them away they turned on him.

The question of a monthly allowance
for the support of Mrs. Fink and her
daughter will come up for consideration
before Judge Hall on June 2. It is not ex
pected that a contest will ensue over the
amount to be paid, but that an amicable
settlement will be made and the troubles
of the Fink family be closed in the legal
calendar.
The suit of Fink against Fink, who Is
a well-known commission merchant of
San Francisco with a handsome home in
Alameda, was stubbornly fought by the
husband. Soon after the filing of the
complaint charging him with cruelty, he
came forward with an answer accusing
his wife of being too gay for a married
woman of her years. She was accused
of ignoring Fink and accepting the com
pany of other men. A number of letters
and photographs were placed in evidence
by Fink in an attempt to prove his allega
tions. The case was heard behind closed
doors.
When the decision was announced Fink
left the courtroom In company with his
counsel, Attorneys Reed and Frick. He
wore a broad smile of satisfaction, seem
ing pleased at the turn of affairs. v
A few moments later the plaintiff, ac
companied by her attorney, H. C. Mc-
Pike, and her daughter, who had been on
her side all through the trial, left the
Courthouse.
"You have chesen your paths and you
must continue to travel them," said the
court. "Both you, Mrs. Fink, and your
husband are at fault in this matter and
I do not consider that you are entitled to
a divorce from him. The faults of each
of you have been aggravated by the ac
tion of the other. The charges of ex
treme cruelty made by the plaintiff are
not substantiated. The petition for di
vorce is denied."
Mrs. May E. Fink was denied a divorce
this afternoon by Judge Hall. She sought
a separation from her husband, Alonzo
W. Finjc, on the ground of extreme cruel
ty. In denying the divorce, Judge Hall
took occasion to roundly score both par
ties to the suit. He said that they were
both to blame for the present condition
of their domestic affairs and that the
wife was not entitled to a decree.

Since the university closes Thursday
and there is nothing till the following
Wednesday it is likely that some of the
seniors may leave for home as soon as
their work is finished, and have their de
grees forwarded to them by mail.
Friends of the university on the scene
are working in the hope of amicably set
tling the matter to-morrow with the dis
affected students.
A motion to make up the deficiency by
an assessment was hopelessly lost. All
contracts for music, decorations, printing,
etc., were revoked.
When the student managers presented
the facts to ihe class at a meeting this
afternoon that body voted almost unani
mously to drop everything which it had
under way for commencement week exer
cises.
As Briscoe's was the leading role there
is now no time to train a substitute.
Hence, so the disaffected students claim,
the faculty's order virtually means no
farce. The class was depending on the
receipts from the play to partially defray
the heavy expenses of senior weeK. With
out it there is no money to carry through
the programme which had been planned.
The cause of all the trouble arose over
the name of John S. Briscoe, lormerly a
Stanford student but who Is no longer
connected with the university. Briscoe is
tlie auihor of the farce, which was select
ed from three competitors. All went well
till last Saturday, when the faculty cem
mittee on student affairs discovered tor
the Jirst time the fact that Briscoe was
to have any part in the play. They de
creed then that he should not take part,
as he is not a student of the university.
This mean? that there will be no festivi
ties unless the matter is compromised.
The senior ball, all the receptions and
even the elegant "promenade" concert
upon the quad, which is a distinctively
Stanford affair and by far the prettiest
event of the year, are called off. So in
jured do some of those who are about to
graduate feel, that it is said they have
refused to play the annual baseball game
with the [acuity. Some of the com
mt-ncement addresses may not reach trie
ears of those for whom they are intended.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. May 21.â
Angered by the action of the faculty
committee in excluding J. S. Brlscoe,
ex-'Oo from the cast of his farce, "To
Have and to Lose," which was to have
been presented here next Thursday even

pense with all cicss exercises during com
mencement week.

At Donsol Major Wise With Two
Companies of Troops Is Be
sieged by a Thousand
MANILA, May 21.-General James M.
Bell, commanding the hemp provinces of
Southern" Luzon, has issued an order to
his officers not to attempt to organize the
municipal governments as prescribed by
Major General Otis in his recent order, on
account of the disturbed conditions. The
Americans occupy a few coast towns,
which the insurgents surround, constantly
assailng the garrisons, which are too
small to attempt operations in the sur
rounding country.
Major Wise with {wo companies is In
Donsol. an Important town of Sorgoson.
surrounded by a thousand insurgents. The
Americans occupy trenches and are con
tinually exchanging shots with the enemy.
Several regiments are needed to control
each southern province, but they cannot
hf spared from their present stations. An
other squadron of cavalry will be sent to
General Bell.
On the first trouble occurring with the
Moros. in the southern part of Mindanao,
at Cottobatto. Major Brett sent a detach
ment to preserve peace at a conference
between two quarreling chiefs. During the
conference the tribes began shooting. One
of the bands fired upon the Americans
from an old Spanish fort. The soldiers
returned the fire, killing several of the na
tives, but they were unable to take the
fort, although a gunboat shelled it. Major
Brett is sending a large body to punish
the recalcitrants. .
The first death of a white man from bu
bonic plague occurred to-day. The victim
was a Government teamster. Several na
tives have died since the outbreak of the
plague at Qutapo market.
PLANS FOR SMUGGLING
DRUGS INTO PRISON
Vials of Opium Dug Up and Photo
gTaphs Containing Morphine
Seized at San Quentin.
SAN QUENTIN PRISON. May 21.-
Warden Aguirre yesterday unearthed a
wholesale plot to flood the prison with
morphine and "yen-shee." The drugs
were enclosed in vials and letters and
newspapers, backs of photographs and
in other Ingenious ways.
For some time the "Warden has suspect
ed a "coup" was to be engineered, and he
has watched and waited patiently. Yes
terday an old road-gang camp site was
dug up and over twenty-two ounce vials
of morphine and cocaine were discovered.
Another camp site yielded 10 packets of
opium, each containing twenty doses of
dope, valued at 50c each, making the value
of the find S100. Besides these .several
needles and one complete "hypo outnt
were unearthed.
Most ingenious, however, was the plan
of inserting morphine in photographs, ine
lavers of pasteboard were separated the
white powder sprinkled between, and all
was then glued up and looked perfectly
solid. Letters bad double flaps containing
sometimes almost an ounce of the covet
ed powder. Newspapers were favorite
transmitters, the back of each page at
the hinge was glued over after being open
ed The receptacle thus formed contain
ing a large supply of morphine. The
loaded papers and letters were consigned
to: Harry Wagner, Michael Rose. Henry
Hempel and Tom Walker. "Will" .Ward
was the destined recipient of the loaded
photographs, which each contained an
immense quantity of morphine.
This blow at the dope smugglers will
probably have a paralyzing effect on
them, the Warden having silently and ef
fectually learned their methods, and un
less they adopt some new "dodge" dope In
San Quentin will In the future be an un
known quantity.

Grand Lodge, Knights of Pythias, and the
Grand Temple, Rathbone Sisters, convened
in this city to-night as guests of the Sa
linas lodges, and a royal reception was
accorded them by the citizens of this
town. Delegations have been arriving by
every train for the past two days, and the
largest first day's attendance for years
was present when the f gavel of Grand
Chancellor Arndt fell to call the
first session to order at 9:30 o'clock to
night. Very little business beyond the
routine of organization was transacted to
night, most of the evening being devoted
to the official reception in which the clty
of Salinas welcomed her visitors. This
reception was the beginning of the many
notable social functions that will charac
terize the week's celebration and was a
very successful opening for the festivi
ties.
Addresses of welcome were delivered by
Mayor Thomas Renlson and Hon. B. V.
Sargent, chairman of the executive com
mittee of the celebration, and response
was made by Grand Chancellor H. U.
Arndt of San Diego.
The reception was held In Armory Hall,
which was elaborately decorated with the
Pythian colors and emblems artistically
combined with the stars and stripes and
beautiful flowers and growing plants.
The town is gayly decorated In honor of
its visitors and presents a very pictur
esque appearance. The celebration and
sessions of the Grand Lodge will continue
through the week, closing Friday night.
All delegates are expected to be here by
to-morrow night and the Grand Lodge
will probably get through considerable
important business before adjournment on
Friday.

TAKE UP THE

Senate Defeats Morgan's Mo
tion by a Vote of
28 to .21.
" ? ii Â»
Alabama Senator Had nought toHava
Isthmian Waterway legislation
Precede the Philippina
Measure.
WASHINGTON, May 21.â The postofflce
appropriation bill was passed finally in
the Senate to-day, the amendment to ap
propriate 1223,000 to carry out existing con
tracts for the pneumatic tube service be
ing agreed to. The vote on the bill stood
33 to 1(3.
An effort was made by Morgan of Ala
bama to displace the Spooner Philippine
bill with the Nicaragua canal bill as the
unfinished business, but it failed by a votÂ»
of 21 to 25.
The resolution offered a few days ago
by Morgan directing the Interoceanic
Canal Commission to make an investiga
tion with a view of ascertaining whether
there was any corporation or organization
of individuals which had for its purpose
the obstruction of the United States In,
constructing, an isthmian canal and for
other purposes, was adopted.
A House bill to detach certain coun
ties from the Northern Judicial district of
California and to attach them to the
Southern Judicial district of California,
ami providing for the holding of terms of
the United States courts In Fresno and
Los Angeles, was passed.
At the request of the Committee on
Privileges and Elections, the resolution re
lating to the Montana Senatorial case was
postponed until Thursday at 1 o'clock.
Sullivan of Mississippi offered a resolu
tion directing the Secretary of the Trea
sury to inform the Senate whether volun
teer officers and men in the late war with
Spain were paid twice for the same ser
vice. It was referred to the Committee
on Military Affairs.
Morgan moved to proceed to the con
sideration of the Nicaragua canal bill.
This would have displaced the present un
finished business. Morgan's motion was
defeated. 21 to 28, as follows:

HOUSE PASSES BILLS
BENEFICIAL TO LABOR
Extends the Eight-Hour Law and
Prohibits Inter-State Traffic in
Prison-Made Goods.
WASHINGTON, May 21.â The House to
day, under suspension of the rules, passed
two Important bills reported by the Com
mittee on Laborâ one to extend the eight
hour law to all laborers employed under
contract on government work, and the
other to prohibit Intpr-State traffic in
prison-made goods, by bringing them un
der the Jurisdiction of the police power?
of the State. The former bill Is designed
to carry the law of lSlK! to its logical con
clusion.
The convict labor bill caused some sharp
Inquiries from members from Southern
States, where prison-labor is employed In
the fields and In the mines, but on assur
ances that it would not Interfere with the
production of coal, cotton, or lumber the
opposition wa3 not pressed.
POOLROOM FOR WOMEN.
Dan Slinkey Obtains Permission to
Open One in Sausalito.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAUSALITO. May 21.â Despite the pre
election promises of. Adolph Sylva, a
poolroom tor. women will be opened up
here almost Immediately, Dan Slinkey
and Frank Payne being Its projectors.
This action on the part of Sylva has
broken over his head the vials of wrath
of the entire "hill tribe." as one of the
points on which most stress was laid by
Sylva and Jacques Thomas, the town
bosses, was that women were not to be
permitted to gamble In any way what
soever. Although Sylva has refused to
fsrant a license to any other poolrooms
than Daroux's or Harvey's, yet he has
reached out the "glad mit" to Dan Slin
key, his fellow-townsman and his nom
inee for the position of poundmaster, and
admitted him into the fold, although
excluding Harrison and other pool
sellers who tried to obtain a license, and
thus disturb the snug monopolies Dar
oux and Harvey paid their good round
sums for. Citizens here feel alarm over
the "Pooh-bah's" latest breach of faith.
"It Is the thin end of the wedge," said
a prominent townsman, speaking of the
matter to-day. "I don't doubt that a few
months more will witness the fair name
of the town besmirched by touts and I
thugs, and every one of Sylva's glib !
promises of law- and order broken as
easily as they were made."

THE McGlade case before Judge Cook
came to a sudden and unexpected
stop yesterday. Three jurors de
manded that they be excused from
the panel. Counsel for the defense re
fused to entertain an excuse for the cause
they alleged and counsel for the prosecu
tion moved that the whole jury be dls
chargred and that the case start over
again.
The three jurors asked for their llberty
on the ground that it had been stated that
they had been irregularly drawn. They
declared it was a reflection upon them and
they did not wish to serve under the cir
cumstances. Then Otto I. Wise, special
counsel fcr the prosecution, came forward
with an affidavit to the effect that the
jury was irregular and making charges of
irregularity against Oscar Tulle, the court
clerK who" drew the jury. There was a
hot argument for a few minutes, when
it was decided to allow the matter to go
over until this morning, when it will be
heard before the three Superior Judges of
criminal departments. Judge Lawler,
Judee Cook and Judge Dunne.
J'^B. Williams was the first juror to de
mand his release. He was followed in his
plea by John Corbett and then by A
Hiller, "but their prayer was not heeded.
Then Mr. Deuprey, the assistant District
Attorney, ro^e and suggested that, as
what he had to pay was not exactly prop
er for the jury to hear, it be ordered to
withdraw from the courtroom. .T. J.
Lennon, who represents McGlade. object
ed on the ground that the jurors, having
heard fo much, had better hear the re
mainder. His objection to their absence
prevailed. Deuprey moved that the Jury
be discharged on the ground of irregular
ity and read an affidavit sworn to by Otto
I." Wife.
The fore part of the affidavit related to
the drawing of the first nine Jurors. The
panel had been exhausted on May 15 and
the Judge had ordered a special venire
of forty to be returned by the Sheriff.
This panel also was exhausted on May 1C
and the court ordered twenty-five names
to be urswn from the general jury box.
He aJso ordered attachments against
eight r.f the special venire of forty, who
had failed to respond. These were re
turnable on May 17. The affidavit then
picks up the case on May 17 and g;Tes on
to relate:
At thitt time but three vacant chairs remained
in* the Jury box and the clerk proceeded to im
panel the "balance ot this jury: that from the
box he drew the names of Corl>ett. Willis and
Hi'.ler, all of whom had been subixÂ»naed by
ordt-r of the court for the special venire, and
no r.->.mes from the lift of twenty-live ordered
by the court were called. 1 then went to the
desk of the clerk upon which the jury box was
placed and looked into the said jury box, where
I s.-iw that the names of Jurors upon the slips
of 'iar>er were not placed in the box \n com
pliance with custom and the law. but that

Every poolroom In this city will be
closed If the ordinance introduced by
D'Aiicona at yesterday's meeting of the
Board of Supervisors be ultimately de
clared a law of the municipality. The or

The beard at its last meeting passed an
ordinance against gambling on horse and
dog races. This permitted the selling of
pools on boxing or prize-lights, but the
present ordinance will make the law a
sweeping one and prevent pool-selling of

tfuporvisor DAncona, In presenting his
ordinance, stated that the action or his
associates in prohibiting betting on

"The poolroonis are a menace to the

COMMISSION POSTPONES.
PROPOSED EXAMINATIONS
The Many Applicants for Clerkships
Must Await Final Action by
the Court.
New San Francisco, so far as the Intro
duction of civil service In the various
branches of the government Is concerned,
is in an unsettled condition to say the
least. The Civil Service Commission met
last evening and indefinitely postponed the
proposed examination for . "Ordinary
Clerks." which was scheduled to take
place on the evening of May 25. There
were many matters which would have en-
Kaged the attention of the commission at
the meeting last evening had it not been
for the existence of the temporary writ
of injunction heretofore, issued by Judge
Cook, restraining any action on the part
of the board until the further order of
court. This writ was granted In accord
ance ' with ; the prayer of the complaint,
filed for the purpose of testing- the consti
tutionally of the clauses In the charter
establishing the commission.
After {the reading of the minutes of the
last meeting of the board and discussing'
pome minor propositions the matter of the
proposed, examination for "Ordinary
Clerks" was taken 1 up in executive ses
sion. The board decided finally to Indefl
rltely postpone the examination and
await the action of the court In the mat
ter of the complaint and restraining order
now before it. : . â¢-
A resolution was introduced by Mc-
Carthy at yesterday's meeting of the
Board of Supervisors in which the Tax
Collector is directed to bring suit against
the Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Com
pany to recover the large amount due
the city. The sum represents the amount
of license taxes of $2 per quarter Imposed
on electric . machines by an ordinance
adopted three years ago, but which haa
never been enforced. The order adopted
by the present board taxing telephone!
operated in this city at 50 cents tÂ»nch pÂ«;r
quarter, which has been disregarded by
the telephone corporation, will itlm> tlgure
in the suit.
The suit is the outcome of tho com
pany's refusal to pay the license which
fax Collector Scott demanded Sfvrnil
weeks ago. For this refusal John I. Hnbln,
president, and F. W. Eaton, *ccrptnry of
the company, ar*> now iind*r nrre?<t nnd
are out. on obnds. They Â«ro liable
to a line of $100 each, hut Supervisor Me
Carthy says that they will imt wlpo out
the company's obligations to the city by
so doing.
"The officers of the company may ho ar
rested every day," said McCarthy In pre
senting his resolution, "but 1 do not con
sider this sufficient. They might be nr
rested Indefinitely and the city would not
be receiving Its just ('lUes. The question
sn/nild be determined in the civil courts
and the City Attorney .should present* tho
city s side of the case."
The resolution recites:

URGES ACTION TO SAVE
THE REDWOOD FORESTS
Supervisor Reed Submits Report to
Supervisors as^a Result of Visit
to the Big Basin.
Supervisor Reed submitted a report at
yesterday's meeting of the Supervisors on
the preservation of the redwood forests
of Santa Cruz and San Mateo counties. In
accordance with a resolution. Reed went
as the board's representative to examine
the redwoods in company with a commit
tee from San Jose, Santa Cruz. Stanford
University, . State Normal School, Santa
Clara College and other interested parties.
The report states that there are yet re
maining of hundreds of thousands of acres
of redwoods only about thirty-five thou
sand acres, divided betweoir' Santa Cruz
and San J.lateo counties. It is proposed to
make of this a national park. The forest
that yet remains is solid because it Is far
thest from the railroad. All of the land
from Santa Cruz to the standing timber
has been completely devastated by the
lumber men and forest fires. The report
continues:
"The present rate of devastation is 4Â»A
square miles per year. There are 44 square
miles of standing timber left. If anything
Is to bo done It must be donu quickly. The
Interest of San Francisco in the preserva
tion of the trees lies in the fact that if
they arc destroyed a very important por
tion of Sin â¢ Francisco's potential water
supply will bo ruined. It is said that $2 -
WW.OOO would buy and preserve all these
redwoods and give us at the doors of San
Kninvlwo tlilft wonderful forest as a herl
tngo forever."
Firemen Did Not Know ; the Body
Was in the Ruins Until After
the Fire Had Been Ex
tinguished.
Hugh Rodden, a barber, was. burned to
death last night in a fire which partially
destroyed his shop at 406 Folsom street.
The explosion ofia lamp caused the blaze.
The body was taker! out of-the ruins after
the fire department- had-flnished Its work.
Rodden was employed during the even-
Ing, and at S:JO started to close his place.
A coaloil lamp exploded and scattered
burning oil about the room. The barber
rushed into the street and caused an
alarm to be turned in from box 51.
Before the department arrived Rodden
hurried back into the burning building.
No- one- knew that he had entered, and
the., firemen devoted their attention ex
clusively to extinguishing the blaze. When
they started to clean up the debris they
were horrified to discover a charred corpse
close to the donor.
It is supposed that Rodden returned to
the building in the hope of saving some
(if his property. Once inside, his clothes
ignitÂ»d and thi dense volume of smoke
3 ml flame partially suffocated him. He
dragged himself as far as the door, but a
snaplock held it fast. V' ,'i"- !
The body a3 it appeared at the Morgue
was horribly disfigured. All the clothing
had been burned off and the flesh cooked
to a crisp. Rodoen was 40 years of age. a
widower and leaves three children, all of
whom are residing with their grandparents
cn Harrison street.

BARBER MEETS
TERRIBLE FATE
IN THE FUMES
there were two separate and distinct packages,
one on either side of the jury box, and each
carefully placed so that an Intermingling of the
names was absolutely impossible. The two
packages were at least two Inches apart and
each pÂ£Â»ckage was carefully piled up. I called
the attention of the court to this proceeding,
but presently the cleric had sworn the Jury,
closed the box and revolved the same.
I further depose and say that at no time
before this during that session of the court
did t!ie clerk revolve the box, for I took special
notice.
Continuing his affidavit Wise goes on to
say that immediately after the adjourn
ment of the court he went to the
Sheriff's office to Investigate. He
found that four deputies were ordered
to summon the special venire and to serve
summons only upon the best citizens ob
tainable. Deputy Nutzner served ten, out
of which but three were called, and all
were excused; Deputy Jenny served nine;
out of which one was called and excused;
Deputy McCarthy served nine, of which
four were called and excused. The fourth
deputy was William Dasha, bailiff of de
partment 12. where McGlade is under trial.
He summoned sixteen, out of which six
were called and accepted by the defend
ant. These were Corbett. Deiling, Willis,
Hiller. McGurren and Shafer.
Dasna was called and questioned in the
presence of Sheriff T^uokmann and Under
feheriff Hare. He said he had never seen
the men mentioned before. He said he
was walking along Market street when he
met Hiller. He had never seen him be
fore, did not know his name, residence or
occupation, nor anything else about him,
but he served a.subpena on him. H*?
pursued the same tactics in the cases of
Corbett and Willis. In the case of Deil
ing. he said he met the juror on Sacra
monto street just as he was leaving a
building. He kri^w nothing about Deiling.
As to Shafer, Dasha said he was' walking
along Tenth street when he saw a milk
wagon approaching, and he served the
driver Vf the wagon, whom he did not
know and had never seen before. And as
to McGurren. he was served In a saloon on
Market street near the City Hall.
I'pon this statement of facts the. Dis
trict Attorney made his motion for the
discharge of the jury. In his motion he
made the following points:
That thÂ» alleged Jury obtained for the trial
of the forpgoing action has not b^en had In
accordance with the rirovisions of the lav.- as
hrrclnbe fore Fpcclned, but has been impan
eled !n m'.xed form.
First â From an alloeed regular selection from
names taken originally from names cf citizens
selected for t!'.e twelve Superior Judges of the
Superior Court for the city and county of San
Francisco, State of California, in January. 1300.
Fecond â From a special venire ordered by thi?
court an.l Violated in summoning in this: That
a large jwrtion of said special venire was sum
moned from people In the street and from a
milk wagon in Hurnmuninir thÂ° driver thereof,
and that puch Fummnninc under order for a
special venire was ip rart from hyiiandcrs
and nnt from the txniy of the county.
ThlrJâ In perking to oltaln a part of said
alleged Jury had herein from names of twenty
five citizens whose names were drawn from the
trial jury box containing names of talesmen
selected by the Judges of the Superior Court in
January, 1000.
Fourth â That those summoned as trial jurors
under the order for special venire herein were
summoned irrespective of whether they were
residents, citizens, taxpayers or competent.
Lennon opposed the motion on the
ground that It was made to Intimidate
the jury and to prejudice them against
the defense. He was asked by the court
if he had any counter affidavits, and he
replied by asking for time to prepare ar
guments in the matter. It was then or
dered that the case come up again this
morning.
Oscar Tolle, the clerk, made a state
ment to the County Clerk in regard to his
connection with the affair. He said hu
drew the jury as he had drawn every jury
for the past fifteen years that he has
served in the County Clark's oflice. He
said the names of those jurors attached,
as well as the twenty-five new ones, were
all put into the box together and shaken
up. He declared that the names drawn
were drawn properly and regularly. As
for any heaps of names in the box, .he
said if there were any he did not see
them.
Dasha made a statement to the Sheriff
in which he described the manner in
which he secured the jurors for his part
of the special venire of forty. He said he
went out as he always did and took the
first likely looking men he met on the
street and that the three other deputies
did the fame.
An it stands,* the case is one of veracity
between the court officials and the prose
cuting counsel, but It may be that there
has been so much said that the Judge
to-day may consider it better to let the
jury go and start again. The defense
makrs no secret of Its theory In regard
to the whole affair. The challenges of
the prosecution had been exhausted and
they were powerless to stop objectionable
jurors, so the defense believes this meth
od was resorted to to secure a more sat
isfactory jury. The prosecution main
tains, however, that the question of chal
lenges never entered into the controversy,
for they wore exhausted long before any
irregularity was discovered in the draw
ing of the names. It Is also the theory
of the defense that the prosecution has
allowed the matter to go too long and
having allowed the Jury to be sworn
without objection it must accept it with
out further complaint. â¢ .
The matter will be settled one way or
the other this morning.
Those on the" jury are F. L. Gunstz, B.
Grave. R. J. Hancock. Clarence Musto,
E. D. Sachs. J. B. Williams. F. E. Shafer.
H. F. McGurren, Fred peiling, E. Willis,
John Corbett and A. Hiller.
The Board of Education, having shorn
Superintendent of Schools Webster of
nearly all his power, It now remains to be
Been whether he can be forced to do the
board's bidding. The storm that has been
gathering for some time between the Su
perintendent and the Directors broke at
yesterday's meeting, and the deluge some
whai. enlivened the usual dull proceedings
of the board.
Superintendent Webster declared that
he wculd not obey the order of the board
to prepare examination questions, and
backed up his declaration with some huge
hunks of the State law. He made the
declaration first In writing and then oral
ly, for the special enlightenment of Di
rector Casserly, who would not be satis
fied with anything else. The Superintend
ent declared that he is not the executive
officer of the board. It is likely that the
question will ultimately be left for. the
courts to decide. Superintendent Web
ster's written declaration Is as follows:
To the ilonorawie Board of Education, in
and for the City and County of San Francisco â
On the 9th inst. I received a copy of a circu

jects, except In reading and penmanship, and
report the same to the Board of Education on
or before Tuesday, June 1. 1900." Although not
officially Informed of this action of the Board
of Education constant inquiry at my office by
teamen-, which the above mentioned circular
ha.' 0* .-Ired. as well as my desire to avoid any
misarii-.-ehension on the part of the board.
AVhKe I should be pleased to aid the board
In the preparation of (juestions which it may
need In the proper examination of any grade
or grades yet my oflice has its own examina
tions of schools to make and the press of busi
ness renders it necessary that I do not as
sume the dual duty oi preparing questions for
examinations given and managed separately
by the board and the superintendent. I had
hoped that the superintendent's examinations
might have been utilized by the. board as a
partial basis for the promotion of pupils, and
with that hope I submitted on the 2d of May
certain resolutions that have apparently been
ignored. Therefore I am constrained to In
form the board thus early and officially that
a request such as Is contained in resolution 5,
even though formally and directly brought to
my notice, would have to be disregarded by
ID*.
I would add that If the members
of the board desire to prepare questions for
the examination proposed I will be ready and
willing upon proper notice to meet with them
and to aid in the formulation of such ques
tions. Respectfully submitted,
R. li. WEBSTER,
Superintendent of Schools.
It was this letter that caused the tem
pest. Director Casserly, who was acting
chairman, asked the Superintendent point
edly If it was his intention to utterly dis
regard the order of the board, to which
Mr. Webster replied that he had Intended
to convey that impression.
"Do I understand you to mean," queried
President Mark, "that you do not consid
er yourself the executive otflcer of th:s
board?"
"Only within certain limitations, fixed
by the State law^* was the reply, and
then the Superintendent commenced- to
qupte from the State 'law to define his
position.
After considerable discussion Director
Klncaid moved that a day be set aside on
which the Directors meet the Superin
tendent and consult concerning the ex
amination questions. President Mark sec
onded the motion, but later moved, as a
substitute, that the board meet on June 1.
He took the ground that Webster, being
a member, of the board, must naturally
meet with the board and needed no spe
cial appointment. T5oth the motion and
the substitute were lost.
Superintendent Webster here found oc
casion to complain that he had not been
notified of special and regular meetings of
the board as required by law. The secre
tary explained that he had always notl
lied the Superintendent in writing, except
during the first month, when Webster had
never failed to attend.
The matter was then left in just that
position. Superintendent Webster claims
that his stand is legal, and it seems to be
up to the board to prove that it is not.
