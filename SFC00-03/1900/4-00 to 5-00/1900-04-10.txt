realize that Lord Roberts is in for a win
ter campaign, lasting several, month?.
This ls the end, in a few words, of .the
high hopes based upon Lord Roberts'"bril
liant dash to Kimberley and Bloemfon
tein.
Preparations are being made to hold
Bloemfontein against surprises. Lord
Kitchener has been given an important
duty, being responsible for the. protection
of the railway, while Lord Roberts Is
waiting for remounts and winter clothes
for the troops, whose thin cotton khaki
uniforms and boots are worn out.
General Brabant and General Gatacre
are both at a standstill. Lord Roberts
will probably for some time confine his
cperations to clearing the Free State be
hind him of raiders tnd to the relieving of
Mafeking, for which purpose apparently
the Eighth Division, now arriving at Cape
Town, has been ordered to Kimberley.
DOYLE SAYS TOMMY IS
LIKE WESTERN COWBOY
LONDON. April 10.â The Bloemfontein
correspondent of the Dally Mail, tele
graphing Sunday, says:
"The air is thick with rumors of large
forces of Boers to the southward, but
there is no positive official information
on the subject. On the. other hand the
railway is said to be well guarded.
"Dr. Conan Doyle contributes to the
Friend of the Free State a picturesque
description of the British infantry.' He
says:
" 'Who could have conceived .that had
seen this prim soldier in time of peace
that he could bo quickly transform * him
self into this grim, virile barbarian?
Bulldog faces, hawk faces, hungry, wolf
faces, every sort of face except a weak
one. Most of them have swarthy faced
and lean a little forward, with eyes
steadfast and features Impassive but reso
lute. Here is a clump . of mounted in
fantry, with a grizzled fellow, like a fierce
old eagle, at the. head of them. Some are
maned like lions; some have young, keen
faces, but all. leave an Impression of
familiarity upon me. Yet I have not seen
irregular British cavalry before. Why
should it be so familiar to meâ this loose
limbed, head-erect, swaggering type? Of
course, I have seen it in the American
cowboy over and over again. Strange
that a few months of the veldt should
have produced exactly the same man as
springs from the Western prairie.' "
BEWILDERING MOVES
OF THE BRITISH TROOPS
LONDON, April 10.â The Bloemfontein
correspondent of the Morning Post, tele
graphing Sunday, says: "The movement
of troops continues with bewildering fre
quency, brigades and divisions appearing
and disappearing at brief intervals. .No
specific accounts of such movements are
permitted. Some remounts were fired on
yesterday on the railway while they -were
on the way here from the south. The en
emy are reported to be In considerable
numbers to the southeast of the line. The
Boers are also apparently feeling their
way frequently to the west of the line.
A party has been thrown forward and has
reoccupled the laager at Paardeberg,
probably to search for burled arms and
ammunition."
WEPENER GARRISON
PRACTICALLY ISOLATED
LONDON. April 10.â The Times pub
lishes the following from Wepener. dated
Sunday, April S: "The Wepener garrison
is practically isolated. However, the lines
are enormously strong and the force Is
fully provisioned. Desultory firing between
outposts continues. A commando esti
mated at 2000, with four guns, went Into

the direction of Dewetsdorp."

TOXDON, April 10.â Ceaseless activ
jtT.Aci.sre.at <Jarinc pa tb*rpart of
Lthe Boers, "immobility and lack of
energy on the part cf the British.
This summarizes the present situa
tion in South Africa, so far as dispatches
from the seat cf war are allowed to set it
forth. Boer forces are close to Bloern
, fontein in several directions. They have
laagered near Donkerspoort, only
tighteen miles to the southeast. They
rtlll occupy the waterworks at Sannah
Post, seriously Inconveniencing the garri
son and townspeople. Numerous bodies
appear to be traversing the entire coun
try toward the Cape Colony border, ter
rorizing- those who recently swore alle
giance to British authority.
At Reddersburg there is said to be a
large body and various commandos are
between Dewetsdorji and Smithfleld.
Some have also been seen on the west of
the railway at Wepener. They confront
General Brabant in euch force as to con
stitute a grave menace to his colonial
division.
Roberts' army in and around Bloemfon
â¢ tein is apparently still unable to move be
cause cf the lack of horses and winter
clothes for the troops.
General Gatacre has under his com
mand several strong contingents which
cannot move far from their present sta
tions because it is their imperative duty
to protect the commander-in-chief's com
munication.
Thus in a vast section of the Orange
Free State from Thaba Nchu to Rou?:
viiJe, and from Ladybrand and Wepener
to Reddersburg. there exists practically
ro British authority, where a month ago
the British flag seemed to be everywhere
predominant. Beyond Kimberley the
country is full of Boers.
In Northern Natal the unbroken front
of the enemy along the line of Drakens
berg ranee and Bigffarsberg stares Bul
ler m the face, Buller's army Is not in
the beet condition, cither, to take the of
fensive. From Natal comes a heavy list
of deaths from disease among the men.
Â¦who are suffering from dysentery and
enteric fever, nearly if not quite as se
vere as during the siege of Ladysmiih.
A new scouige, pneumonia, due to want
of warm, winter clothing. Is appearing j
among the troops in both sections.
Thus the British advance is temporarily
paraJyzed by disease, lack of remounts,
clothing and transport facilities. Mean
while the Boers are as mobile as when
the war first started. They are, more
cver. employing the best possible tactics
to retard tjie British advance by their
daring raids, wherein they gobble up de
tached bodies and threaten comunicatlons.
The report that Sir Leslie Rundle. com
manding the Eighth Division, had been
ordered to Kimberley seems to indicate
that Lord Roberts thinks he has enough
troops In his own great army without the
Eighth Division, and planned to move a
column by way of Kimberley and Vryburg
co as to turn the passages of the Vaal
River.
For the moment interest centers about
General Brabant, who has before him.
i.ear Wepener. the main body of the raid
ing Boers. Parties of unknown strength
are between his forces and that of Gat
acre to the cast. On the left flank is
Basutoland, which by an unwritten agree
ment is forbidden ground to the bellig
erents. In his rear rebellion is boiling up.
General Brabant is almost In the position
if having to turn his back to the wall
(Basutcland). Should the Boers disregard
the border and move into native territory
the colonial leader would be surrounded.
It is this contingency that has caused
ominous suggestions of the injection of a
still more terrible element in the war
that of armed savages. It is Ingenuously
stated by the London papers that should
the Boers cross the Basuto border British
residents would be powerless to restrain
the fierce blacks from attacking t res pass -

HAD A MINED AMBUSH.
LONDON. "April 10.â Lady, Sarah Wilson
and other Maf eking correspondents : send
diaries of ; the doings there, . showing that
the ' Boers have, tried by abandoning their
trenches to , lure the besieged out Into a
mined ; ambush: V Fortunately the British
engineers :: discovered the â¢> mine, cut' the
wire Â¦ communication and " unearthed â¢ 259
pounds of dynamite and' war gelatine.- â¢ Â¦â¢â¢
for outstanding loans of $103,000 on notes.
He was directed to bring the list of
notes, the trial balances and sheets of the
bank since Its organization, and the last
statement was this from Mr. Wheeler:
Told What to Expect.
"We would like also to be in a position
to show through you. Mr. Pitcher, the
condition of the bank at the present time.
Its outstanding notes, and show just what
the security is, and we are going to ask
you questions concerning the value of va
rious securities, and will also a3k you
questions concerning the personal loans
and unsecured assets of the bank."
"I will be prepared to answer all these,"
replied Mr. Pitcher.
The answer was in death.
The relations of Henry H. Pitcher to
the Varney trust and to the Bank of Liv
ermore disclose some extraordinary fea
tures of modern financiering. It is strong
ly suspected that the disclosures already
made along that line had led the banker
to wonder how much was to come. Way
back in ISSS Pitcher was a clerk In the
Bank of California. He had considerable
ability, and when old Thomas Varney
wanted a man to manage the bank he pro
posed to open at Livermore H. H. Pitcher
got- the position. Pitcher's sister. Mrs.
Amy P. Cecil, went with him, and old man
Varney installed her in the bank as book
keeper. Â¦"" V 'â¢
In Full Control
Five years afterward > arney died. His
will made Pitcher, John Taylor and Var
ney's nephew. T. H. B. Varney, his ex
ecutors and trustees. A trust provided
for the payment of certain beneficiaries â
S2COO annually. .The executors and trus
tees, together with Henry Varney and G.
W. Langan, continued the bank's busi
ness. In wnich the old man had put JICO.OOo
in gold as capital stock. The books now
show that besides this there is $136,000 of
the Varney estate funds in the bank on
deposit. <>
The trustees and executors made
Pitcher cashier and manager, and he had
full charge of handling every detail of
the business, which represents the prin
cipal item of the Varney estate and trust.
Outside of the present contest, the trus
tees got along swimmingly, save for one
battle with Grace King, who claimed as
an adopted daughter of old Varney a big
ger share than his will allotted to her.
The executors compromised with her for
$90,000. Then the trouble broke, when the
contest now on for an aexounting from
the trustees began.
After the opening of the trial the first
disclosure was the methods by which
Trustee Pitcher had handled the trust
funds to buy valuable mining stock, which
was a portion of the estate of which be
was an executor.
Owes the Bank $15,000.
The bank s accounts now show that
Cashier Pitcher owes the bank $15,000. on
notes secured by 100 shares of the bank
stock, which has a par value of $10,000.
This same block of stock Pitcher testified
last Friday had been given to him by old
Thomas Varney, but to make sure that
It was all right Pitcher had put his nota
In the bank to cover the deal. He was
not positive whether It was an outright
gift or not.
It also transpired that 1600 shares of
Kennedy mining stock was sold by the
executors, then Immediately bought In at
$3 or $4 a share, the money to purchase T.
H. B. Varney's portion and Pitcher' 3
portion coming from the bank. The stock
has paid big dividends, which were put in
the trustees* pockets.
Â¦ It was this line of disclosure that bad
been reached when court adjourned Fri
day.
"Was a High Liver.
"While Pitcher had cultivated the Liver
more Valley people sedulously, he was not
unknown In the San Francisco halls of
pleasure. The banker had a penchant tat
Co-operative Creamery Association, lead
er In the town library board, president of
the School Board and president of . the
board of trustees of the Presbyterian
church. It was his hobby to be a leader
and for years he had his way. His first
defeat came last May. when he failed of
election as a Town Trustee. . vt'.v .
Discovered by Hired Man.
The banker's suicide was discovered at
8:30 o'clock by Hans Sorenson, a man-of
all-work, and the only other occupant of
the Pitcher residence. He knew his em
pioyer was to go to court In Oakland to
day. Sorenson arose about 5:30 o'clock,
did his morning chores, and then falling
to see Pitcher, went to the banker's oed
room to call him. Sorenson found the
door ajar, entered, and saw Pitcher lying
In bed. the bed-clothing over his head.
Turning down the covers, the banker's
head, drenched in blood, was revealed and
the big Colt's pistol he had used was by
his side. Pitcher had placed the muxzle
of the weapon in his mouth and sent the
bullet through the brain.
Dr. Taylor, the family physician, was
hurriedly called, but could only send for
Deputy Coroner Horton, who took charge
of the body.
Run on the Bank.
Bookkeeper Fred Mathieson of the bank
was also summoned, and word was sent
to Oakland. Quickly the news spread and
a crowd of anxious depositors gathered
at the bank doors, and as soon as they
were opened, made a rush for their
money. Mathieson met the call for a
while, at the same time trying to cool the
excited depositors, and to prevent a rush
until at least word was received from
Oakland. On the morning train money ar
rived and about 512,000 has been paid out.
When the doors closed at 3 o'clock the.ex
citement had subsided, and the Immediate
danger from the run was at an end.
President Varney said:
"We will flood the town with money to
morrow. There is ample coin to meet the
demands of depositors and all we need In
the greatest emergency Is $12,000 to $14,000.
We have $120,000 In good securities upon
which to raise that If necessary.-"
The intense excitement at Livermore
was not a circumstance to the surprise in
Oakland when word reached the Superior
Court, where Pitcher was awaited to go
on the witness stand. As soon as Judge
Seawell called the case Attorney Wheeler
asked for an adjournment until to-mor
row. Attorneys Moore and Goodfellow in
sisted that they had been unable to see
anything in the deceased banker's conduct
of a dishonest character, and after ad
journment was ordered the attorneys took
a train for Livermore. In the party were
Trustees T. H. B. Varney and John Tay
lor: Attorney Charles Wheeler and A % S.
Treat, representing the beneficiaries who
have attacked the Varney trustees' man
agement, and Attorney A. A. Moore and
W. S. Goodfellow. representing Pitcher
and Taylor, and Attorney G. W. Langan.
counselor for the Bank of Livermore.
The party arrived at Livermore at 1
o'clock, poing at once to the bank. De
positors were paid rapidly as soon as the
trustees arrived, the majority of those
withdrawing their funds being small
holders.
Investigation Is Begun.
At once the work of Investigation was
commenced.- Every attorney, trustee and
bank employe was a unit in declaring that
he knew of no cause for Pitcher's suicide.
The utmost care was taken to assure the
public that bo far as they had gone no
discrepancy In accounts had been found.
The significance of last Friday afternoon's
scene 'in court was impressed, however,
with the rush of 'lawyers and bank peo
ple to get at the books. .
Pitcher was under examination by At
torney . Wheeler *on Friday afternoon In
court. The bank cashier . had explained
some matters in connection with his hand
ling of the trust's property, and was then
told that on Monday he would be re
quested to show what securities he had
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
111S Broadway, April 9.
HENRY H. PITCHER, for fifteen
years cashier and manager of the
Bank of Livermore, a trustee of
the 5500,000 Varney estate and the
most prominent man of affairs in Liver
more Valley, committed suicide thl3 morn
ing by shooting himself In the head while
in bed at his residence in-Llvermore. â¢
A bullet through the brain was the bank
manager's final answer to a demand made
last Friday that he produce In court to
day all records and . statements which
would show the present condition of the
institution of which he- had been the guid
ing hand since its foundation. The suicide
left behind not a message nor a scrap of
paper to tell the story. But for days he
had been at a high nervous tension over
the disclosures which were being made In
the Varney trust contest, and rather than
face the ordeal of the searching inquiry
he knew was ahead the distracted finan
cier ended his life.
Feared Disclosures.
The tragic climax to the slowly unfold
ing, story of the management of the Var
ney trust startled the community. At
Livermore there had been considerable
uneasiness over the bank's affairs, due to
the Varney litigation, the bank being the
chief investment of the trust,' and the
cashier's suicide caused a run on the in
stitution. This was met and depositors
were given assurance this afternoon by
the surviving trustees and the various at
torneys in the estate that there would be
ample funds to meet all demands.
As soon as word of Pitcher's death
reached Oakland Trustees Varney and
Taylor,, with Attorneys Wheeler, Treat,
Goodfellow and Moore, repaired to Liver
more and an examination of the books
of the bank was at once begun. The trus
tees have placed Charles G. Reed of the
Union National Bank of this city in
charge of affairs, and to-morrow Expert
Accountant Stewart of San Francisco will
start to. work to expert the bank's books
from the beginning of Its business. The
Bank Commissioners gave notice to-night
that their Inquiry would be opened to
morrow morning at the bank. President
Thomas H. B. Varney announced officially
last evening. that so far as they had been
examined the books and accounts were In
proper shape.. He said the affairs of the
bank would be Investigated to the bottom.
Attorneys in the Dark.
The attorneys and the trustees declared
that they were completely In the dark
concerning the cause of Pitcher's death.
The dead man had absolute control of the
bank and had handled all of its business.
Both Trustees Taylor and Varney of the
Varney'estate and officials as well of the
bank had left the entire control of the
affairs of the institution In Pitcher's
hands. One of his most significant moves
was to secure $5000 last .Saturday after
noon for use at the bank to-day. But
Pitcher, If he had In mind his own death,
concealed Â¦ his thoughts marvelously. As
late as yesterday morning he had a long
conference in Oakland with Trustee John
Taylor, Attorneys Moore and George W.
Reed, preparing evidently for his exam
ination in court to-day.
The ; lawyers had questioned him at
great length over his affairs. After that
he went to Berkeley, visiting his wife
and daughters, who have -been residing
there for six weeks. At Livermore on his
return last evening all reports are : that
he appeared to be cheerful.
Feared Loss of : Prestige.
..But behind "the financial affairs which
did ' disturb Pitcher he had Van' almost
morbid fear of loss of standing and pres
tige through what might be. evolved* from
the . pressing investigation of the trust
affairs he had so long controlled.

GERMAN COMMENT
ON BOER SUCCESSES
BERLIN, April 9.â The latest develop
ments of the military situation in South
Africa are Interpreted as very unfavorable
to the British. \ The Kreuz Zeltung's mil
itary' writer says:
"Evidently Lord Roberts'- troops have
lost greatly in their fighting fitness. More
over, the enormous loss of horses renders
the case desperate, since the Boers will
evidently prevent reinforcements reaching
Bloemfontein."
The article concludes as follows:
"It is an admirable achievement, per
haps an unprecedented masterpiece, that
4000 Boers have not only managed to hin
der for weeks the march of a fivefold
army, but have also contrived to damage
the British communications seriously."
Professor Mommsen, in the Deutsche
Revue, answers the recent pro-English
argument of Professor Max Muller. He
condemns the South African war as un
just and concludes as follows:
"In England's glorious history a new
page is upturned, namely: the work of an
executioner against the belated followers
of William Tell."
The comments of the press upon Profes
sor Mommsen's declarations are those of
unqualified indorsement. The Tageblatt
fays:
;*Every ' word Professor : Mommsen has
written is indorsed by a nation of
60,000,000." _
CAPTURED BRITONS

LONDON. April 10.â The Bloemfontein
correspondent of. the Times, telegraphing
Sunday, says: "Two captured Boers agree
that only fifty men remained unwounded
out of the whole British column captured
at Reddersburg. General Gatacre and his
staff were fired on from inclosures while
they temporarily occupied Reddersburg."
SECURITIES DISAPPEAR.
LONDON, April 10.â The Cape Town
correspondent of the Daily Mall, tele
graphing Sunday, says: "I have received
information to the. effect that negotiable
securities of the value of Â£130,000, which
were lodged by law with the Free State
Government by foreign insurance - com
panies, have disappeared. The New York
Mutual Life Insurance Company has is
sued a warning against dealing in them."
PAPERS ARE PROTESTING.
LONDON, April 10.â The Russian and
French papers are still protesting against
Great Britain's use of the Beira route in

Is nothing to confirm the dispatch' from

GONZALES. Tex., April 9.â The
flood situation' here to-night is not
much improved, the river having
fallen only about four feet since
yesterday. There has been great
loss of cattle in the river bottoms and it
is feared a dozen or more lives have been
lost. A Bohemian and his wife, panic
stricken. Jumped Into the turbulent
waters ten feet deep and were almost im-<
mediately drowned when they could have
remained In safety. It is thought a negTo
boy of Marcus Tate's was drowned and
two Mexicans are missing. Reports com*
in that a number of bodies have been
seen caught on snags and barbed wire
fences.
The river farms are ruined, but the
total loss cannot be estimated as yet.
The Aransas Pass track is blocked for
five miles north of here. Several bridges
and a hundred yards of track are washed
away. The last train has come down
from Lullng. via Harwood, on the South
ern Pacific tracks.
Great Loss of Property.
AUSTIN, Tex., April 9.â The flood situa
tion here is improved somewhat, but the
reports from points below Indicate that
the full effect of the immense volume of
water is being felt in Wharton and La
fayette counties, everything being inun
dated and much loss of property and live
stock being reported.
In Bastrop County the flood has caused
great damage and something like fifty
washouts and losses of bridges are re
ported by the railways. Advices from
the area surrounding the county seat of
Eastrop County are to the effect that
there has been some loss of life among
the farming class, as their homes were
inundated without warning by the tidal
wave, but outside of an unconfirmed
rumor that eight lives were lost nothing
can be learned. . In the southern part of
this county several persons are missing,
the number representing a family of six
Italians and twoÂ»,negro families, whose
bouses hay*;. b<3r^;.wÂ«yihed^* way. _ 'â¢-
T The" river.' is YSce" ding" rapidly at" this
point and above, notwithstanding <tho fact
that another heavy rise was reported
early this morning on the Concho, . 125
miles north of here.' Advices â¢ to-night
from La Grange, in Fayette County, are
to the effect that while much of the lower
portion of the town is under water, the
property loss is small. No one Is missing.
The International and Great Northern
Railway and the Missouri, Kansas and
Texas have been seriously crippled by the
floods. The first named road has had
600 washouts and lost bridges on its road
from here to the Rio Grande.- The Mis
souri, Kansas and Texas is' likewise a
heavy loser, having to abandon much of
its track altogether and use the Interna
tional and Great Northern from Taylor to
Mllano; and the Santa Fe track from
there to North Texas points.
Cotton Crop May Be Replanted.
It is now believed that the damage to
the cotton crop will not be of such extent
as has been predicted from some places,
as the season Is yet early and all the
crop could be replanted.
The citizens of this city held a mass
meeting 1 to-day, at which the consensus of
opinion was that it was not feasible to
rebuild the dam and power house, al
though no definite action was taken- A
proposition was made to the meeting 1 by
the old water 'company, whose plant has
likewise suffered from the flood, that it
would take all the piping and wiring of
the city plant and such of its apparatus
as could be recovered from the wreckage,
pay fair value for the same, rejuvenate
its plant here and furnish the city with
water and light within two weeks. The
proposition was turned over to a commit
tee of twenty citizens to be considered. In
the meantime the water and light com
mittee met and instructed the superinten
dent to at once procure from New Or
leans or some other available point a
steam engine, by which it is hoped that
the city may operate one- of its big pumps,
which remains Intact, and supply the city
with water until other arrangement
could be made.
Much fear is being entertained with re
gard to the sanitary situation, as the city
is already beginning to show the effect of
lack of drainage water. Governor Sayers
to-day gave the city $500 out of the flood
sufferers', fund to be expended in behalf
fo the poor who have been made home
less. All such are being well provided for
and there is no danger of their suffering.

TACOMA. April 9.â The leaders of or
ganized labor on Puget Sound are . pre
paring to join the California labor unions
in demanding that a law be passed ex
cluding Japanese from this country. An
Immense influx .of Japanese laborers
started on Puget ' Sound two years ' ago,
when the Northwestern Railroad began
to hire them in place of white laborers.
Thousands of Japanese are now at
work and it is readily foreseen that when
the rush to Alaska ceases there will be
trouble over the question as to whether
white or Japanese shall work for the
great corporations. . Several members of
the old "committee of thirteen," which In
18S6 drove the Chinese, out of Tacoma.
declare they are ready to undertake sim
ilar work with regard to the Japanese.
The Tacoma Trades Council Is at work
securing figures as to the number of Jap
anese coming to this country. It is in
tended to use the figures before Congress.

Adjutant General Corbin said to-day re
garding the dispatch from Manila which
stated that reinforcements had -been re
quested by Generals Young and Bell of
General Otis:
"It is a fact that I have learned that
such reinforcements have been requested
of Otis. No official notice has been given
me regarding this matter, but I can state
that the forces under Young and Bell are
inadequate. General Bell, In particular,
is greatly In need of troops, and' I have
heard through direct sources that his ope
rations, owing to the lack of troops, have
been greatly hampered time and time
again."
General Corbin went on to say that Gen
eral Otis had directly under his command
more men than he really needed, and that
in all probability the requests of
Young and Bell would be Immediately
granted, and that they would be supplied
with troops from the forces now in the
vicinity of Manila. In conclusion, the ad
jutant general said that with such rein
forcements as they desired Generals
Young and Bell would actively engage the
Insurgents and attempt If possible to re
store peace In the provinces of Luzon.
Asks for Investigation.
Representative Levy of New York to
day introduced a resolution in the House
which, after reciting the statements that
thirty officers and men of the army in
the Philippines have committed suicide
and that more than 400 are now confined
to insane asylums, and that serious
charges have been made against officials
in the transport, commissary and quar
termaster service, calls upon the Secre
tary of War for Information and author
izes the Speaker to appoint an investi
gating committee of the House if he
thinks necessary. t
CAPTAIN SYDNEY A. CLOMAN, U. S. A.
This officer, who commands a company of the Twenty-third Regiment of
regular infantry in the Philippines, is charged with having ordered a mas
sacre of captive natives to avenge the treacherous killing of Americans. Ac
cording to a letter written by Corporal Leonard Mygatt to his Bister In
Brooklyn Captain Cloman first forced confessions from the Filipinos that
they had assisted in the murder of Americans. Then he detailed a squad of
thirty men \o take the prisoners to a spot near camp and dispatch them.
The natives were huddled together while the soldiers fired Into the band until
not one was left. alive. In his letter Corporal Mygatt does not give the
name of the officer who ordered the massacre, but as he is a member of
Captain Cloman's company it is taken for granted that Cloman Is the one
to whom he refers.
MANILA, April 9â An Interesting topic
of conversation In army circles Is the In
vestigation of Brigadier General Freder
ick Funston's execution of two Filipinos
and the possibility of a court-martial re
sulting therefrom. The story is that the
Filipinos captured three Macabebe scouts,
who were crossing the country near San
Isidro, and were preparing to kill them,
when cne of the Macabebes escaped and
found General Funston with a scouting
party near. This man guided the Ameri
cans to th? rescue of his companions and
when the troops approached the Filipinos
fled, leaving the Macabebes.
Several of the Filipinos were shot and
General Funston captured two of them,
took them to the villlage square and
hanged them without trial as a warning
to the Filipinos.
The present method of warfare and ln-
Ftances of the mutilation of prisoners
have Incensed the army soldiers to euch
a degree that they feel Justified In making
reprisals, which has been done on several
occasions recently. There Is a strong
feeling among the residents and friendly
Filipinos that the Chinese general, Pana,
who. as announced on March 31. surren
dered to Brigadier General Kobbe after
terrorizing the province of Panay. should
be severely punished. It Is pointed out
that his career has been more that of a
brigand than of a soldier, as he extorted
money by torture from worthy natives
and burned alive some of his followers
who Intended to desert him. It Is be
lieved Pana surrendered because he
feared his own men and he expected to
be paroled, like other officers, and enjoy
the fruits of his brigandage.

WASHINGTON. April Â».â After some

jected the sectarian school amendment to
the Indian appropriation bill, offered by
Jones (D.) by a vote cf 30 t0. 16. As has
been the practice for two or three years,
the free homes measures was offered as
an amendment to the bill, but it was ruled
out on tho point of order that it was
general legislation and. therefore, not ger
mane to an appropriation bill. Without
division the bill was passed. The measure
carries about $8,414,000.
An unsuccessful effort was made to
agree upon a date for a vote on the reso

ATTEMPT TO RESCUE
INDIAN MURDERERS
Chilkat Braves Attack Officers Hav
ing in Charg-e the Slayers of
the Hortons.
VANCOUVER, B. C. April 9.â Stirring
scenes followed the arrest of eleven In
dians for the murder of Bert Horton and
his wife near Sullivan Island, Alaska. The
steamer Cutch, which arrived here to-day
from Skaeruay, -brings' the story of an at
tempt to rescue the Indian prisoners at
Haines Mission by a hundred young
bucks, all armed, to repel whom the
troops stationed at Skaguay were called
out and tho Indians driven oft without
loss of life. â ,
At the preliminary examination of the
prisoners it was shown that the Chilcats
had first put the husband to death, sub
jecting him to many atrocities, and dur
ing tho following week had Kept Mrs.
Horton a prisoner, repeatedly abusing her
before finally killing her. The greatest In
dignation prevailed at Skaguay and an
organized attempt was made to lynch the
prisoners. This, however, was prevented
by the troops, who successfully guarded
the jail.
Another feature of the case was the vol
untary surrender to Deputy United States
Marshal Tanner of another Indian who
said he had been concerned in the mur
der. There are now twelve Indians In jail
awaiting trial, charged with. the murders
of the Hortons or complicity therein. It
seems that the Chllcoot andChllkat In
dians believed they could commit murder
with Impunity because an Indian named
Tom recently returned from McNeils
Island, who, had been pardoned while
serving a ten-year sentence for killing a
white man. This Indian told the" others
that he had been well cared for, and as
he was well dressed upon his release his
term of detention appeared to be 'Â¦ exceed
ingly pleasant. Â« â¢"Â¦
The killing of the -Hortons was caused
by the desire of the Indians to gain pos
session of the white woman, associated
Â¦with their superstition that a life for a
life Is a necessity.

Admiral Is Gaining Supporters and
Bids Fair to Become a Formid
able Factor at Kansas
- Special Dispatch to The- Call.
CALLHEADQUARTER9. WELLING
TON HOTEL.,. WASHINGTON, April 9.â
Admiral Dewey is much encouraged -by
assurances of support he is receiving from
all parts of the country, and which, his
friends say, are coming principally from
conservative citizens. Including many
prominent business and professional men.
While he will say nothing on the subject
himself, his friends declare that, even if
he be not elected, the admiral will feel
that he has been amply compensated for
seeking the Presidential nomination if his
candidacy results in the defeat of Bryan.
Admiral Dewey's forthcoming statement
will express his positive political convic
tions.
Admiral Dewey Is not the only man who
is hearing from the people. There are
indications that many politicians are be
ginning to appreciate that they under
estimate his strength with the voters of
the country. One of the 'most prominent
Democratic Senators said to-day there
was undoubtedly a very strong sentiment
in favor of the admiral's nomination, and
he expressed the belief that it might man
ifest Itself so strongly before the Kansas
City convention as to bring about the
substitution of Admiral Dewey's name for
that of Bryan. This Senator has hereto
fore stood with the Bryan forces, and he
is not yet ready to allow himself to be
quoted In favor of the admiral, though
he may do so soon.
Democrats are awaiting with much In
terest some unmistakable Indications of
what will be the attitude of the New
York Democracy toward Dewey. It is re
alized that if the delegation of the Em
pire State should go into the Kansas City
convention as his supporter ho would at
once become a formidable rival of Bryan.
Though no Tammany man in Congress
would confirm the report, it was said to
day that the Tammany leaders were se
riously considering the advisability of
supporting Dewey's candidacy.

PRO-BOER RALLY
OF THE SCHOOLBOYS
PHILADELPHIA. April 9.â One of the
greatest demonstrations of sympathy",
both in the number participating and the
enthusiasm displayed, ever shown in this
city for any foreign nation took place" to
night, when the Academy of Music was
Jammed with people for the purpose of
taking part in the Philadelphia school
boys' pro-Boer rally. The primary object
of the gathering was to send a message
of greeting to President Kruger. signed
by 22,000 pupils of the schools of this city.
So great was the crush, mostly of the
younger generation, that many thousands
were unable to get near the doors, and
the mass of struggling people was enter
tained by music while the meeting inside
was In progress.
Judge William T. Ashman of the Or
phans' Court of this city presided, and
those who addressed the meeting were
Webster Davis, W. Bourke Cockran, ex-
District Attorney Graham of this city, P.
Louter Wessels of Bloemfonteln and
Thomas J. Meek, a pupil of the High
v Â¦ 'Â¦ living, enjoyed the select quarters of
the Union League Club, was a bon vivant
tnd an epicure. For several years there
was strong rumor that his domestic
nfT&irg were not entirely satisfactory. His
Â¦wife, however, lived under tho same roof
with him until a few weeks ago, when Bhe
took a home at 262 C Durant avenue, Berke
ley, the reason assigned being that she
might send their daughter. Miss Pearl
Pitcher, to a private school. An older
daughter. Miss Hazel Pitcher, also accom-
Snled them. Pitcher called there yester
y. Mrs. Pitcher and her daughter Pearl
went to Livormore as soon as news of the
euield** was received. The funeral ar
rangement k will depend upon her desires.
Pitcher was born in Sacramento in l&W.
At eighteen years of age he was book
keeper for Treadwell & Co., a big mer
cantile firm of that city. The house
failed and the Bank of California took
charge and Rav<? young Pitcher the man
agement to wind up the business. Later
he did surveying in Virginia City and
Truckee. and finally began his banking
career In the Hank of California, from
which he graduated in ISBS to go to Liver
more. In 1*72 he married his present wife,
who was then Miss Annie G. Clark of
Sacramento.

The last report of the Bank Commis
sioners shows that the Bank of Livermore
had 5C4.000 due to depositors. outÂ£ld> of
JjHS.CC'O 6u<? to the Va/ney estate. There
was $Â«.<KÂ»i and more on hand and due
from other banks. The two principal
Items under inquiry are $128,000 loaned on
mortgages and $103,000 on personal notes
The stock of the bank k was held as fol
lows: H. H. Pitcher. 100 shares; T. H B
Varney. 70 shares; John Taylor. 10 shares-
G. 'W. Lar.jran. 10 shares, and the Varney
estate. 800 shares.
I>cpositors Are Safe.
"Concerning our investigation," said
President T. TL B. Varney to-night, "I
can only say that so far as we have gone
the books are all right, but we have taken
Heps to go to the end and everything will
be examined for ten years back and since
the trust went Into force. That must be
done for the protection of everybody.
While I cannot account for Mr. Pitcher's
suicide, I must confess that it has left
us In a -most embarrassing and uncom
fortable position. He was the executive
head of the bank and was most thorough
ly Informed as to Its affairs. So far as
our depositors are concerned they are
safe. The bank is solvent and there is 1
plenty of money now to meet all demands.
To-day's run was to be expected. But It
is all over now, I nope."
"I agree with Mr. Varney," said Attor
ney Wheeler, "in no far as the present
appect of the bank's books is concerned.
We found nothing irregular, so far as se
curities went. There will be a thorough
examination, I understand. I believe the
bank is In a safe condition."
Coroner Mehrmann will hold an In
quest In the Pitcher case to-morrow even-
Ing.
Stipulations were secured to-night from
all the attorneys In the Varney case, and
the books of the Livermore Bank will be
sent to I-ivermore to-morrow for the use
of the Bank Commissioners in making
their examination.

NEW YORK. April S.â Correspondence of the Associated
Press, dated London. March 31. states: The officer with
General Buller. who scathingly described the disaster at
Spicn Kop to-day, continues his remarkable series with
a denunciation as bitter as ever fell upon a general.
This week his article Is confined to a general review of the strat
egy, or rathÂ»r lack of which preened the relief of La
<i>-sTn!t.h. and he includes a terrible indictment against the use
less sacrifice of the Irish Brigade, vhose gallantry excited so
much admiration in England. The officer writes:
Yes, LadyFmith ha? h<?en relieved at last. "We have been blunder
ing ai'-r.g the l!n*> of bJUa that fenn that northern bank of the Tugela
for many months, attempting to pets It at all sorts of Impossible
place a-.d suffering heavy !oss each, time. That Is an accurate descrip
tion of the ten v*ks' campaign on the Tugela. No one knew the
Frcund or took the trouble to learn it. As an example of this sublime
in<i:rrerÂ«>r.ce General Duller was not aware that Hlangwanl Mountain,
vhirh commands the crosslr.g of the Tucela. was on the southern side
cf the river until he had failed in three different attempts. Vet he
lived for weeks wlth'.n tnree or four miles of the hill, and at the battle
cf Colenso his rifht flank extended beyond It. As to strategy there
was none, neither *r joU, bad nor indifferent. The troope were moved
aJrr.g and wl>Â«>n a hill or nn lntrenchment appeared In front they were
ordered try tak<Â» It. S-iniPtimes they failed, sometimes they succeeded;
pSoi when they â.-. succeeded after terrible loos the post was found
'ti be us^^fs end was abandoned. This is the blind folly In which we
have l*ev. rrsaged and which tr.cre through good luck than anything
f-\*e ha? eventually succeeded. But had not Lord Roberts* victory
drawn away a great part of the B<xrÂ« for defecse of their own country
It would never have Fuc<*Â«Â»e<Jed and Ladysmlth would have fallen. Thus
Â¦n.-aken^i. 'he Boers had not force enough to occupy such a long de
fensive ;-c-siti ti and one by one the strong places fell Into our hands.
On Friday, February Â£3. General Hart waa ordered to send up the
Rangers, the Innlskililngs and the Dublin* along the line
cf thÂ«Â» ra'.iroail to attack some low hills where the river turned again
to-srard the east. The cp^ration was most difficult and dangerous. Six
companies of the Inniskilllngs and two companies of the Connaught
Hangers formed the attacking ilnes; the remainder of the rangers and
half of the Dublins were in support; the reserve consisted of the other
half of the Dviblins. In this order the Irish Brigade recroesed the
rallw&y ar.3 becan the attack, coming at once under a severe crosg-flre
frcn: the hli'.s en the right and left. It wae euch tactical errors that
led to Eurh terrible loss of lif*. Some troops had indeed been sent to
?hp fell! on the left, but they wfre not ordered to push the attack and
they could not from their j^oeltlon.
Even en the northern slopes they merely acted as sentries to pre
rent our bpjr.g entirely cut off. Any one could see that it was madness
to Bend an attacking force upon the central hill, while the flanking hill
T-as tn^inW ar.'l the Boers thereon were left free to concentrate
their fire for its defense.
But st-jpid B9 was the srheme, the method adopted for its execu
ti-ri was even worse. General Hart placed himself on a neighboring
hl'l with a t^!escone and a bugler; h*> was completely cut of touch with
the attack, and could not Â«cc when a rest was necessary or when an
ettark could profitably tx pressed. These matters are felt only by the
officers on the spot, and It Is absolutely necessary to lea\-Â»; It to their
discretion. There he Â«tood. sounding at Intervals "the advance,"
then "the double" and then "the charge." When It appeared to him
that the attack was not proceeding rapidly enough to suit his taÂ»tfe.
the bug'.e rang out again In peremptory tones. Our artillery mean
while was shelling the trenches at the top of the hill, and kept down
the enemy's fire from that direction co that the advance line got
to within :Â¦Â» yards of what eeemed to them to be the top, and waited
for a moment to take breath, under cover of the steepness of the
Mil. Then the peneraTs bugler sounded the three calls, "advance,"
"double." "charge." The word wa* passed along the ranks; bayonets
â¢were fixed, and springing to their feet the men dashed forward with
a cheer. Not a shot vu fir-d by the enemy and the place seemed to
be deserted. The crest wu reached and passed and the triumph
feemes complete. But alas, tkat crest was a 'false one: there was a
plight dip behind, then another rise which constituted the real crest.
As the men advanced over the skyline and exposed themselves to full
view, the Boers suddenly stood up In their trenches and fired In quick
succession the flve rounds with which the Mausers were charged, at
a range of fifty yards. The effect was too terrible to describe. That
great rush of men, confident and erect as a great wave nearlng the
shore, was checked in a moment. There was a stagger forward and
then all that remained was a line of poor helpless human beings
struggling on the ground in agony. Some rose again, perhaps hot
knowing what they were doing, and fell, pierced in many instances
with a dozen bullets. Those who marvelously escaped the murderous
discharge could only lie with the others, hoping to escape observation;
the slightest movement of an arm or leg. whether it was the death
struggle of a wounded man cr the incautious attempt of one of the
lucky ones to get better cover behind a rock, drew a Bhower of
bullets, bringing certain death not only to the unfortunate man him
self, but to many who lay around him. Stillness was the only hope
of life. I will not anticipate the official returns, as the number of
killed and wounded have been differently stated, but I fear they are
very bad. I know that out of 100 men who charged with the two com
panies. Flxty fell, and that any escaped was due only to the uneven
neys of the ground In certain' spots, which concealed, .at the critical
moment, parts of the line. The loss of the Innlskllllnga wan stated
to be well over 400, out of 800 mustered that morning, but I believe
this to be an exaggeration; two companies were' left behind, only
about 500 men advancing to the attack and probably 400 took part in
the charge. I should think 200 should be nearer the mark. Five offi
cers only are left.
This disastrous charge took place about 5 o'clock, and there the un
fortunate lay, dead, wounded and sound, huddled together or scattered
just as they fell, covered by Boer rifles, "unable to move or look around.
The groans and cries of the wounded were terrible to listen to; some
cried for help, some murmured for water. Once or twice, moved by
pity, a sound man would try to get his wounded neighbor to the rear,
but he was shot instantly. What was felt during those terrible hÂ«urs
I will not attempt to describe. The hill could not possibly have been
taken until Pieters Hill on the right rear came Into our possession
and until the enemy had been driven from the kloof and hill on the
left. Moveover. if It had been taken. It could not have been held, for
the summit was swept by crossfire and enfilade. In fact, the Irish bri
gade was only jiaved from annihilation or capture by the extraordinary
steadiness of the soldiers and because. the enemy's guns and a great
part of the fire had already been drawn. Nor would the position have
given ub any great tactical advantages. The Boers would still have
held the mountains from Grobe'.ers Kloof and Onderbrook to Pieters
Hill and their lines would have remained unbroken.
I come now to the saddest part of the story- The poor" wounded
men who have been struck down in the gallant charge remained where
they fell not only all Friday night, but during all the blazing heat
of Saturday, and evefc Saturday night passed without relief. Not a
drop of water In their feverish mouths; no food, no help, but a tropi
cal sun beat on their heads. Oh, the intolerable agonies that were
endured. If one heard that such a thing would happen in England to
a horse or dog one would shiver with pity, but here hundreds of gallant
Irishmen, who had fought as no other troops have fought in this war,
were left on the battlefield to endure a horrible death. Most of them!
of course, died. One of them, a very senior officer, whose name out
of pity I shall not mention, suffered so terribly that he begged those
near him to put him out of his pain. He died during the day, for no
help came.
I will not attempt to apportion the blameâ if blame there may be.
General Hart was present till Saturday, and it seems to me that a
flag of truce should have been dispatched asking for leave to bring
In the wounded. The Boers have never yet refused such a demand,
and have, indeed, been singularly kind and considerate In all such
cases. There may have been unanswerable reasons against this, but
anyway no attempt was mnde and an explanation ought to be de
manded. On Sunday an armistice was asked for and obtained but
the necessity waa now more to bury the dead than to tender aid to
the wounded.
MRS. FENNELL MAY SEE
HER BOY EVERY DAY
Case Closed in Los Angeles to Be
Reopened in This City in a
Few Days.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, April 9.â Holding In a
tight grasp the hand of his tiny son,
Theodore Marceau Jr., the colonel this
morning walked into Judge York's court
room to answer to the habeas corpus pro
ceedings for illegally keeping the baby
boy from his mother, Mrs. Amanda J.
Fiske-Marceau-Fennell.
After considerable sparring between
Senator White, who appeared for Mrs.
Fennell, and the attorneys for the de
fense. Judge York formally closed tho
matter as it developed that Colonel Mar
ceau has been ordered to produce the
child in Judge Troutt's court in San Fran
cisco on April 23, where the question of
disposition and award will be fully dis
cussed.
While the legal formalities covered a
few moments the contention that Mrs.
Fennell might see her child consumed
over an hour, exhausting the patience of
Judge York. Acting: upon the suggestion
of Marceau. who is endeavoring to hu

may see her son an effort is being made
to force her to .go to the Hollenbeck,
where Marceau resides. As soon as Judge
York suggested the Nadeau, where the
mother has apartments, the cue was
taken and the Westminster proved the
compromise. For the first time In one
week Mrs. Fennell saw her boy- this after
noon for a brief fifteen minutes, but the
faithful maid was denied the pleasure.
Mrs. Fennell will visit her son every

SAUSALITO, April 9.â The poolroom
faction has won out. The town
election held here to-day resulted
In the election of J. 8. Nunes, J. T.
Harmea and Dr. Crumpton for
Trustees. This virtually means a
vfctory for the poolrooms, for although
only one of the new Trustees (Nunea) Is
a poolroom supporter, the two holdover
members of the board. Adolph Sylva and
J. Thomas, are both advocates of a "wide
open" policy, and it was only necessary
for one of Sylva's two nominees to be
elected to assure victory for the poolroom
cohorts.
The reform ticket put forward by the
"hill" and Indorsed by the Good Govern
ment Club labored under a heavy disad
vantage owing to the fact that while but
one of the water front candidates need
be elected to assure the gambling faction
victory, all three of the reformers must
win out in order to gain a majority on
the Board of Trustees.
Although Sheriff Taylor had posted sev
eral deputies at the polls in anticipation
of trouble, the election passed off quiet
ly and the crowd which blocked the street
leading to the Town Hall, though mainly
composed of the much-maligned "water
front," maintained an excellent decorum.
The majority of, the "hill tribe" is en
gaged in business in San Francisco and
J. T. Harmes and a few challengers and
watchers were almost the sole reform rep
resentatives on the scene. Harmes hoped
early in the day that the Influx of hill
voters by the afternoon boats would turn
the tide in favor of the good government
faction, but his hopes failed of realiza
tion.
Old residents cay that this election has
roused more bitter party feeling than any
ever held In the town, both sides feeling
that the question involved of poolrooms
or no poolrooms must be decided once
arid for all at the polls to-day. "Jack"
Hannon, candidate for and incumbent of
the Marshalship, wrested the victory
from his opponent, John E. Creed. Frank
Lindsay is elected Clerk and Recorder,
his opponent being George Ryan, and J.
V. Silva wins the light for Treasurer over
A. Lawrence.
The 211 votes polled for Dr. H. J. Crump
ton show his popularity, the total num
ber of votes polled being 350. Hannon
beat Creed by 154 Votes, the former hav
ing 245. while Creed's was but 91. Law
rence was bested by GO votes, SUva hav
ing 195 in his favor.
The fight for Clerk between George T.
Ryan and F. D. Linsley was the closest
of the day, -Ryan polling 162, Linsley 175,
only beating him by 13. J. T. Harmes was
a bad second to Dr. Crumpton, with 177.
One hundred and seventy-two votes were
recorded to Nunes, while Dickinson and
Becker were out of the running with 154
and 162 votes, respectively.

SACRAMENTO, April 9.â lgnace Pad
erewski, the pianist, who was to have ap
peared at the Clunle to-night, canceled
his engagement this afternoon and seat
purchasers have been given their money
back. Seventy-two seats were sold to par
lies living at such widely distributed
points as Lodl, Rocklln, Auburn, Blue
Canyon, Chlco, Fair Oaks, Vacaville, Lin
coln, Folsom, Dixon, Perkins and New
castle, and naturally these ticket-holders,
who had come to Sacramento expressly
to hear the recital, are very indignant.
The tirst impulse of the general public
this afternoon was to condemn the great
artist for his eleventh-hour action, but
judgment will be softened when the state
ment made by Manager Ficks of the Clu
nle ,to The Call correspondent to-night be
comes known that only nfty seats for the
performance, all told, had been sold to
residents of Sacramento.
This city boasts of one or two fashion
able musical clubs, whose members are
supposed to know the difference between
a rhapsody and a box of sardines, and it
is regarded as strange that not enough
Interest was felt in Paderewskl's advent
to insure a comfortable house for the fa
mous artist. When F. Marion Crawford,
the distinguished novelist, was here a tew
years ago, his lecture was given the com

regular meetings sip tea and rave over the
latest fad.
The attention of Manager Ficks was
called to-night to the fact that it was
Lent, but the manager remarked that the
religious scruples of the theater-goer of
Sacramento did not stand in the way of
their packing the minstrel show last
week. Paderewski left for Oregon to
night.

" I am so grateful to you for your ad-
vice," says Mrs. Sidney B. Oakes, of
Wliitmell, Pittsylvania Co., Va. " When
I commenced your medicines I had been
treated by different doctors for three
months or more, but would only receive
partial relief Â£or a short while and then
would be worse than before. Was con-
fined to my bed most of -.the time. At
tiie time I commenced your treatment
my left side was completely paralyzed.
Had no desire to eat anything; bowels
costive all the time. Nerves were all
unstrung, so I could not bear the least
noise. I also suffered from diseased
ovaries and female weakness. But thanks
to my Maker and you, after following
your advice, I am able to do all my wash-
ing, sewing and house work in general.
I haven't had a spasm in two months.
Left off medicines about one month
ago. Didn't think it necessary to con-
tinue them longer. I have taken about
seven bottles of Dr. Picrce's Favorite
Prescription, seven of the 'Golden
Medical Discovery,* and two vials of
' Pleasant Pellets.' I heartily recommend
those medicines to all suffering as I was."

from .New York about three weeks ago
and secured employments at the Eureka
Laundry, where he worked for only half
a day, but left the house' every morning
as if going to work. He disappeared on
Saturday, March 31, and the police were
notified to look out for him. Miss Boyle
said that her brother was 22 years old and
was of a despondent temperament. The
inquest will be held this morning. â¢
On the body of the dead man was found
the following note neatly written in pencil
and addressed to his sister May:
God bless you, M .darling. May. he take
care of you and jruide you on through life.
I love you dearly because you are the best
and purest little girl in the world. Do not
worry over this act of mine, it is all for
the best. I have lost all interest in life; my
ambition can never be realized.
I have read the workÂ«. or some of 'them, of
the foremost writers of to-day, and yesterday,
on the question of life and death, and have
studied whenever the opportunity presented
itself the ways and doings of the people whom
I have come in contact with. The vast army
of people are led by a number of teachers,
who Instruct them upon the important , ques
tion of here and the hereafter, each teacher
or minister claiming to be a disciple of Jesus
Christ, yet each denomination preaching a dif
ferent doctrine. I cannot understand how we
are to be held responsible for our doings here
when we (preachers Included) know no more
about the hereafter than a child unborn.
Heaven, it Is claimed, is an abode of per
fect bliss, the Inhabitants a class of perfection.
Does It seem reasonable that a being de
parted from this earth (even the most per
fect) could be in a state to enter iuch a place?
I bolleve there are more worlds than here
and what Is taught hereafter. I believe every
human being will one day enter heaven.
And I believe that we will have to go through
many worlds before we are in a state neces-
CRAMPS AND
CARNEGIE MAY
CONSOLIDATE
Steel Company Likely to
Acquire Control of the
Shipyards.
Would Then Be in a Position to Taks
Contracts of Unprecedented
Magnitude From thÂ©
Government.
-âââ?ââ
NEW YORK. April 9.-The World to
morrow will say: Negotiations are In
progress for a combination of the gigantic
new Carnegie Company and the Cramp
shipbuilding concern. .
Among the most profitable branches or
activity in steel manufacturing Is the
making of armor plate for warships. The
Carnegie mills lead all others In this in
dustry- If the Carnegie company should
obtain control of, or a. strong, alliance
with, the greatest shipbuilding concern in
the United States it would be able to un
dertake contracts of unprecedented mag
nitude to build and armor warships for
the United States Government or for any
other power. .
With the power to issue bonds to the
extent of $160,000,000. the new Carnegie
company can easily acquire a big interest
in the Cramp company if the negotiators
come to terms. The Cramps capital is
$5,000,000 stock and $1,500,0U0 bonds. The
profits of the concern last year were
$707 83Â°
The"heads of the gTeat shipbuilding
house are not far from seventy years old.
New York steel men say that the Cramps
are not averse to an arrangement wnicn
will permit them to give up the arduous
labor of managing their gigantic shipyard.
NEW YORK, April 9.â A special to the
Tribune from Plttsburg says: The rumor
that a coalition was being arranged be
tween the Carnegie .and Cramps interests
has been quietly discussed here for some
time but not much weight was attached
to it' until to-day, when a man supposed
to be closely connected with Mr. Frick
and interested in the present Carnegie
company refused to deny or confirm the
report. '
style pursued In this country, the athletes
of Turkey are permitted to scratch, bite,
kick and kill their man in their efforts to
obtain a victory. Adlai says that when he
and Yousouf met in their last bout both
were covered with blJhod from head to
foot. Since his arrival in this country
Adlai has met and offered to meet the
best men in the business. OnÂ© night in
Denver he threw four men in less than
an hour and a half without any effort
whatever. He does not know his own
strength, and it is often feared he will

FATHER TAKES
THE LAW INTO
HIS OWN HANDS
William F. Watson Beaten
by George T. West on
the Street.
Latter Declares His Son-in-Law Has
ni-Treated His Daughter ~ :
and Must Mend His
Way.
Oak'end Office San Francisco Call.
1118 Broadway, April 9.
William F. Watson of Alameda is hav
lr.g lots of trouble with his wives. His
first wife is trying to force him to pay her
aUrcor.y. and this morning the father of
his second wife met him in front of the
Courthouse and proceeded to mix things
with him in a most discouraging way.
Watson's divorce affairs have been pa
raded in the courts and the newspapers
frequently during the last two years. He
separated from his first wife, who has
even ser.t him to jail for refusing to pay
her alimony, ard he then married the
Etepdausfcter cf George T. West of this
city.
West considers that he has a legitimate
grievance- against Watson, and having
watched the failure of the court to compel
Watson to ray alimony to his first
â¢wife, he decided that he would take the
eettlement of his grievance into his own
hands, which he did this morning, to the
disarrangement of Watson's costume and
the disfigurement of Watson's face. The
two were eeparated by Deputy Sheriff
Striker, and Watson continued to struggle
with the court In his successful refusal to
pay his first wife her alimony.
West's disagreement with his son-in-law
Is over Watson's treatment of West's
daughter. West claims that Watson is
trying to alienate her affections from her
parents, that he Is 111 treating her and
that he even locks her up so that she can
rot visit her parents.
"I don't want you to keep dragging my
daughter into notoriety, and I want you
to protect her ar.d not ill treat her," de
rlared West when the two met this morn
ing.
Watson tried to protest his innocence of
any wrong doing, but his protestations did
Dot seem to allay West's wrath.
"You have got to stop your ill treatment
rf her." he repeated, and then his feelings
pot the better cf him and there was a
mix-up.
Â¦It he don't treat his wife right I'll
make him," is ail that West will say of
the occurrence.

BANKERS TO MEET
AT SACRAMENTO
Full Discussion Will Be Given to All
Matters Bearing on Public
Finances.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, April 9.â lt Is expected
that there will be something like 100 dele
gates to the California Bankers' Asso
ciation, which is to hold its convention in
this city on May 3. 4 and 5. Many ques
tions bearing on public finances will be
discussed and efforts will be made to
frame measures for presentation to the
next Legislature desired by the banking
Interests. A circular letter issued by
President Frank Miller to the banks and
bankers of California states:
Since the last convention of the association
the question of currency reform, so long a
source of agitation to the people, has received
a happy solution through the act of Congress
of March 1. I*XÂ», entitled "An act to define and
fix the standard of value, to maintain the
parity of all forms of money Issued or coined
by the United States." etc. This gives occa
sion for congratulation, for the principles ren
dered effective by the act are those which cur
association from Its organization has repeat
edly atlinru d.
There remain within our own State Issues
yet unsettled that concern the people at large
equally with those engaged In the business of
banking.
A uniform law of .negotiable Instruments, as
â¢formulated by a conference of the various State
Commissioners on Uniformity of Legislation in
the United States, and now the law In many
States, was passed by both houses of the last
Legislature, but was not approved by the
Governor. That California failed in this re
spect to take a place in line with the most ad
vanced States of the Union was a great disap
pointment and at the next session of, the Legis
lature the attempt should again be made to
have this law made that of the State.
No question so nearly concerns all classes of
persons as taxation. The first principles of
good government require that all propertly
shall contribute Us just proportion of the cott
of government, no more and no less. Pro
fessor Carl C. Plehn of the University of Cali
fornia, an eminent authority on every phase of
the. question, has been Invited to address the
convention In this behalf.
UNION MEN WERE
AMONG THE RIOTERS
Declaration of a Coeur d'Alene Man
Who Opposes the Miners'
Organization.
WASHINGTON. April 9.â When the
Coeur d'Alene Investigation was resumed
to-day Representative Sulzer made an em
phatic protest against what he character
ized as "snap judgment" by the majority
of the investigating committee. At the
last session the record of the "bull pen."
giving the names of those imprisoned,
was printed. The record printed to-day
showed that a newspaper clipping, pasted
in the book, also had been printed, giving
a list of ringleaders in the miners' agita
tion and some 400 who had been Indicted.
Sulzer's motion to strike out this matter
was lost by a tie vote.
Henry E. Howes, a business man In the
Coeur d'Alenes not identified with either
faction, was offered as a witness to show
the neutral sentiment on the trouble. He
was objected to, however, on the ground
that he was a bitter opponent of the
miners' unlbns. Ills testimony was ad
mitted and he told of the disturbed condi
tions over a series of years, leading up to
the blowing up of the Bunker Hill mill.
The witness testified that he knew that
members of the Miners' Union were pres
ent when the mill was blown up. He saw
and recognized some of the men on their
way to the mill. Some of them applied
to his store for ammunition. Part of his
Information was gained while a member
of the Grand Jury.
Howe continued his testimony at the
afternoon session, giving many details of
the disorder over a long period. He had
not concluded when the committee ad
journed until to-morrow.

gan's court yesterday for the arrest of

after working for him about six months,
got 2OJO cigars, valued at $95. which he

DR. McGIFFERT
TENDERS HIS
RESIGNATION
Formally Withdraws From
the Presbyterian
Church.
States That He Does !J"ct Care to
Stand Trial as It Would Only
Provoke Fresh Dis-
XEW YORK. April 9.-Rev. Arthur C.
McGlffert to-day formally withdrew from
the Presbyterian church. His resignation
was contained in a letter to the presby
tery of New York, which met to-day in
its regular semi-annual meeting. Dr. Mc-
Giffert's request that his name be dropped
from the roll of the presbytery was
granted. Dr. McGiffert's letter of resig
nation was in accordance with an an
nouncement made by him to the presby
tery three weeks ago. The letter in part
is as follows:
To the Presbytery of Xew Yorkâ Dear Breth
ren: In view of the appeal to the General
Assembly of which Dr. Birch gave formal no
tice at the last meeting of the presbytery, I
have decided to withdraw from the Presby
terian church and I request that you will ac
cordingly drop my name from the roll of the
presbytery-
In making this request. I deelre to say that
I do not withdraw because I regard the charges
of heresy preferred against me as well founded
or because I regard the Justice of the accusa
tions that have been made In many quarters,
but I still believe as I believed when I wrote
the General Assembly last spring, that my
views are in harmony with the faith of the Pres
byterian church and of evangelic Christendom
In all vital and essential matter; but I cannot
feel that It Is my duty to go through the trial be
fore the General Assembly which the appeal will
doubtless precipitate, and I am unwilling need
lessly to prolong the agitation that has been
distracting the church and preventing It from
giving Itself unreservedly to the work of ad
vancing the work of the kingdom of Gpd.
By patient study and free discussion only can
the truth be reached and the attempt to deter
mine the correctness or incorrectness of his
torical conclusions by their conformity or non
conformnlty to a confessional standard tends to
obscure truth's supremacy and to promote In
difference to Its claims. Referring in this con
nection to my own book on the "Apostolic
Age." I beg to assure the presbytery that It
wa* written with no thought of committing the
Presbyterian church or any one beside myself
to any of lta conclusions and co with no
thought of provoking ecclesiastical strife, but
eoieiy with the purpose of recounting as accur
ately and as clt-arly as I could the highest of
the apostolic age as I ebw It. I claim that the
question of first importance touching the re
eulie I have reached is not "Do they accord
with the Presbyterian standard?" but "Are
they true?" In a trial for heresy the Inquiry
inevitably concerns itself chiefly with the for
mer question and the latter la too largely over
locked.
IN* a dir.gy house on Peabody street,
rear SunnysiJe avenue, was found
the withered skeleton of Miss Kate
Mliller. a woman hermit and formerly
a domestic. The woman was last seen
- alive six weeks ago and. as she lived apart
from aM humanity and resented any at
tempt at familiarity on the part of rela
tives or friends, little heed was given to
her absence. Yesterday morning her
brother-in-law, desiring to find out her
circumstances, opened a window In her
house ar.d beheld her bones where they
lay on a bed made of rags. Mystery sur
rounds the case to some extent, but In
all probability it will be dissipated and
the conclusion arrived at that death was
the result of natural causes.
About two years ago Miss Miiller built
the house in which she died. She lived
the life of a recluse and was mentally
deranged. It was common talk that she
had hoarded treasury and she often her
self made mention of gold she possessed.
She became estranged from her relatives
end frequently quarreled with her sister.
Mrs. Henry Miller, and the latter's hus
band. Her eccentricities even went so
far as the placing of an additional letter
"i" In her name to distinguish herself
from other members of her family.
Little attention was given to the strange
woman. She frightened the neighbors by
threatening to do them harm, and kept a
loaded pistol to kill any one who should
enter her abode. These threats were also
made to her relatives. The fact that the
woman should so closely guard her house
held increased the suspicion that she was
protecting treasure, fcut nothing could be
definitely learned regarding Its existence.
Hints at robbery and murder were rife
on the discovery of the corpse, but the
officers were unable to find anything
which would positively warrant the con
clusion that a crime had been committed.
An autopsy will be performed. In the
house no treasure was found except a few
gold trinkets in a trunk and $3 in a purse.
Everything In the room seemed In good
order and there was nothing that would
five evidence of any struggle. A revolver,
ully loaded, was found on a shelf above
the "bed.
There Is little doubt that the woman
was insane. Many of her letters were
written to noted authors, long since dead.
In which she spoke of love for them and
Intimated that they had made her a char
acter In their works. Miss Mliller was 37
years of age and was born In Switzerland.
SWITCH MAY BE
EXACTED BEFORE
PAYING NICKEL
Telephone Monopoly Must
Not Charge for Defec
tive Service.
Ordinances Prohibiting Lotteries Are
Passed to Print â Municipal Elec
tric Street Lighting Sys
tem Favored.
After several attempts to legislate upon
the abuses of the telephone monopoly In
requiring: the nickel to be dropped before
the switch is given, the Board of Super
visors at yesterday's meeting passed to
print a new order which It is confidently
expected will correct the defective service
of the corporation. The new ordinance,
which was introduced by Supervisor Mc-
Carthy, is similar to . the others which
were allowed to go by default on account
of apparent illegalities. It prohibits those
rendering telephone service from charging
or receiving any compensation therefor
before the number or party called for an
swers. Any person, firm or corporation
that shall receive compensation in any in
stance before the party or number shall
respond to the call of the person ordering
the service shall suffer a flne or Imprison
ment.
Supervisor McCarthy explained that Su
perintendent Hewitt of the department of
electricity had informed the License Com
mittee during its investigations that there
was no reason why the ordinance was not
practicable. The telephone corporation's
claim that it would be necessary to double
its force to carry out the provisions of the
law was not borne out by the facts. Only
a few extra operators would be required,
and the only opposition came from the
company's disinclination to cease its petty
exactions for defective service. McCarthy
asked that the public be afforded the pro
tection it deserved on the proposition, and
he was supported unanimously by his col
leagues when the vote was taken.
The ordinance prohibiting the possession
of lottery tickets, papers, stamps, tools.
Instruments or lottery devices was re
ferred to the City Attorney for his opin
ion. Sanderson addressed the board in op
position to the passage of the order. He
said that the Political Code already pro
vided for the prohibition of lotteries and
that the bill should be referred to the City
Attorney to determine its legality. Tobln
stated that the ordinance had been draft
ed carefully at the request of Chief Sulli
van, and that It was difficult to obtain
convictions under the State law. Reed
held that the only way to enforce the law
was by ordinances passed by the Super
visors.
The other two ordinances which prohib
ited the "passing, giving, delivery, circula
tion or distribution of lottery drawings, or
copies or memorada thereof, or the distri
bution of handbills, papers, cards, etc.. of
the winning numbers or figures in a lot
tery drawing," were passed to print.
The Committee on Public Utilities sub
mitted a recommendation that the city in
stall its electric lighting distributing sys
tem. The report concluded as follows:
The cost of electrical lighting the streets and
public buildlnes of this municipality would
be inside of $193,136 per year, of which J2S.^5
would be for the public buildings and $164.2a0
for the streets. Your committee believes that
It would be wise to Install this system of pub
lic lighting immediately. While bond Issues
for millions are urged for other public utilities
that will take years In acquiring, this great
Improvement appealing to every citizen every
night of the year can be established during
the coming year. We recommend to the Board
of Supervisors the adoption of this plan, and
providing the means of establishing In the next
tax levy. In the meantime your committee
will endeavor to obtain an offer to put this sys
tem in place for a fixed sum from lome re
sponsible person or corporation.
The resolution directing the Board of
Public Works to establish the grade on
Sixth street, between Folsom and Bryant,
at a cost of $2150. was opposed by the
Finance Committee on the ground that
there were no funds available for the pur
pose. A motion to postpone the matter
until next July was bitterly objected to
by Maguire, who said It .would be an in
justice to the property owners if the
street were not improved. He finally
agreed to allow the matter to lie over
for one week until a conference could be
had between the property owners and the
Board of Works.
Miscellaneous Business.
A resolution was adopted directing: the clerk
to insert in all advertisements Inviting pro
posals for supplies, printing, etc.. a clause re
quiring bidders to pay advertising charges.
The ordinances imposing a license of $15 a
quarter on runners and soliciting azents. of
J o l per quarter on liquor dealers when sales
are under J13.000 and over $15,000 at $41 per quar
ter, on restaurants selling liquors $21 per quar
ter, restaurants serving liquors with meals $5
per quarter when receipts are less than JlOOO
and $10 if they exceed $1000, were all passed to
print.
The Park Commissioners will be requested to
reopen the park gates on Stanyan street, near
Waller.
The Merchants' Association was granted per-
ADVEBTTSEMENTS.

A SCHOOL OF CIVIL SERVICE.

a good deal more commendation than it .merits.

or less antagonism, because it would inevitably train
up a favored class of persons, to whom would go
nearly the whole of the offices of the Government.
The Aldrich bill, it is jo be noted, does not di
rectly provide for the establishment of such a school,
but only for the appointment of a commission to con
sider the matter and report upon it. The commission,
however, will very littely favor the school, for its es
tablishment would mean more appropriations and
more offices for political patronage. It is therefore
just as well to consider the matter upon its merits or
demerits at once and have done with it.
The proposed institution is to be" somewhat
analogous to those now maintained at West Point for
training officers for the army and at Annapolis for
training naval officers. Each of those schools has
proven of great advantage to the najion, but the sue-

Communications were received yester
day from Tahiti, via Auckland, N. Z.,
that the Tahltian Government had accept
ed the Oceanic Steamship Company's pro
posal for a steam service from San Fran
cisco to Tahiti. Heretofore the only con
nection between the Society Islands and
San Francisco has been maintained by
schooners sailing at Intervals of about a
month and occupying from thirty to thir
ty-six days in passage. According to the
terms of the agreement entered into be
tween the Tahitian Government and the
Oceanic Steamship Company a steamship
of about 3000 tons register is to be placed
in the service, to make eleven round trips
per annum, each round trip occupying
about thirty-five days, which includes
thirteen days in port. The distance 13 3C03

mode by the steamers will be about four
teen knots an hour, thus occupying about
ten and a half days on the voyage under
favorable conditions.
John D Sprockets, president of the
Oceanic Steamship Company, states that
the bonus to be paid by the Tahiti Gov
ernment is in the neighborhood of $30,000

A STATESMAN OF THE TIME.
REPRESENTATIVE GIBSON of the Second
District of Tennessee is a candidate for re-elec
tion, and by way of opening his canvass has
sent to his constituents a letter in which he sets fo r th
the record of his services as a statesman. According
to the preamble of the constitution the Federal Gov
ernment was organized to "form a more perfect union,
establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide
for the common defense, promote the general welfare
and to secure the blessings of liberty." It is there
fore worth while to take Mr. Gibson's statement of his
work and note how far it conforms to the intentions
of the founders of the Government.
A summary of his labors runs thus: Eight hundred
and twenty-three war claims put through, amounting
to $1,200,000; sixty-five private pension bills; forty
one men commissioned in the army by his influence;
twenty-nine postmasters appointed; seventy-four new
postoffices established; twelve thousand calls at the
Pension Office; twenty-nine thousand packages of
seeds sent; twenty-seven thousand pamphlets and
books sent; one hundred and sixty-seven thousand
copies of his own speeches sent out; forty-seven thou
sand letters to his constituents.
As not one of these things cari v be said to tend
to establish justice, provide for the common de
fense or to secure the blessings of liberty, it is prob
able all of them were intended by the Congressman to
insure domestic tranquillity or to promote the general
welfare. The war claims, the private pensions, the
twelve thousand calls at the Pension Office, the pack
ages of seeds and the pamphlets sent out and even the
letters written to his constituents may be regarded as
contributions to domestic tranquillity, if by that phrase
we signify the quiet and happiness of the private
homes of those who received the pensions, pamphlets,
seeds and letters. That sort of tranquillity, however,
has been paid for at the expense of the general welfare
and all that has been given in return is the estab
lishment of seventy-four new postoffices, the commis
sion of forty-five politicians in the army and the cir
culation of 167,000 copies of Mr. Gibson's speeches.
It is evident that domestic tranquillity in the Second
District of Tennessee is one of the things we must
have, but it comes high.
Mr. Gibson is a fair specimen of the modern states
man in this country. Most Congressmen have but
two ambitions â one is to fill the treasury and, the
other is to "rake her clean." The Pacific Coast has
neglected that sort of statesmanship and the result is
we are far short of our share of appropriations. _ln
the East they are wiser in their generation, hence the
vast amount of "domestic tranquillity" that prevails
in most of. their .Congressional districts.

A PAN-AMERICAN CONGRESS.
ARRANGEMENTS are reported to have been
made by the Mexican Government for a con
gress of all American countries, to meet in the
City of Mexico, to consider commercial and other is
sues affecting their welfare. Secretary Hay is said to
attach great importance to the meeting and to have
promised the Mexican Government cordial co-opera
tion in promoting it
The enterprise is the more attractive to the people
of the United States since it is but another step along
a path in which the United States led the .way. The
congress which Secretary Blame called together did
not result as beneficially as was expected, but it is to
be borne in mind that Blame did not have the privi
lege of making full use of it. and that the Democratic
administration which came into power neglected to
take advantage of such benefits as it 3'ielded. There
happened, moreover, the repeal of the McKinley
tariff, under which reciprocity treaties with several
South American nations had been arranged, and the
hard times, which paralyzed industry and commerce
to such a degree there was little inclination anywhere
to expand our trade southward.
Since then the war with Spain has given our Euro
pean competitors in Spanish American countries an
opportunity to rouse something of antagonism to the
United States among the people there, and we have
thus been handicapped in our efforts to promote trade
with them since our commercial activities have re
vived. The proposed meeting in Mexico will give us
a chance to prove to the delegates that the true inter
ests of all Central and South America are to be
sought in closer trade relations with the United
States. We are large consumers of the coffee, hides
and fine woods which they produce, and can in return
furnish them with machinery and manufactured good 3
better and cheaper than they can be obtained else
where.
The interests of California and other States of the
Pacific Coast in the proposed congress will be not
inferior to those of any other section of the Union,
and whenever it meets we should have ample repre
sentation. In the wonderful possibilities of the in
creasing trade of the Orient there is much to attract
our attention away from the countries and the mar
kets to the south of us, but the latter will be well
worth striving for. As soon, therefore, as the time
and scope of the congress are definitely announced,
our manufacturers and merchants should set about
arranging to profit by every opportunity it may offer
for an increase of our trade.

HIGH WATER MONEY MARK.
REPORTS of the Treasury Department for
April show there is now more gold, more sil
ver and a larger total of money of all kinds in
circulation among the people of the United States
than ever before in the history of the country. That
circulation is, moreover, attended by a widespread
prosperity and a general activity in trade in all sec
tions of the Union. Such is the condition that con
fronts Mr. Bryan as he wanders about the country
denouncing the gold standard, howling against trusts
end screaming calamity into the ears of all who will
The treasury statistics reveal the fact that the
cmount of money in circulation is not only absolutely
larger than in previous years, but it has more than
kept pace with the increase in population, and the per
capita circulation is the highest known. The total
amount is now in excess of $2,000,000,000, and the
per capita amounts to $26 12. It is to be noted, more
over, that the increase has been one of steady and
continuous progression since 1896.
A satisfactory feature of the showing is that there
has been an increase in the circulation of both sil
ver and gold. The amount of gold and silver certifi
cates in circulation on the Ist of the month was
$785,845,549, against $727,748,591 April 1, 1899;
$618,448,941 April 1. 1898; $554,582,096 April 1, 1897,
end $489,151,505 April 1. 1896, the increase during the
four years being $296,694,044, or 60 per cent. The
amount of silver in circulation, including standard
silver dollars, subsidiary silver, silver certificates and
treasury notes of 1890, which were issued for the pur
chase of 6ilver bullion and are to be retired when sil
ver is coined and put in circulation, amounts to
$631,133,689. against $626,982,804 April 1, 1899; $610,
661.729 April I, 1898; $569,024,775 April 1, 1897, and
$558,524,447 April 1, 1896.
All of this vast sum of money in circulation is as
pood as gold and honest as the day. We have not at
tained a fictitious display of wealth by scaling down
the value of the coin of the republic, as the Bryanites
desired in 1896 and as Bryan continues to advocate
row. Workingmen get their wages, clerks get their
salaries, and farmers, manufacturers and miners get
the price of their product in money that is equal to
the best on the globe. The Republican policies of
protection and sound money have once more been
put to the test of practice and have demonstrated in
operation their efficiency in promoting the welfare of
Once more, then, we enter a campaign in which the
voters will be confronted by a condition in opposi
tion to a theory. A widespread prosperity prevails in
the land, and every form of industry is benefited by it.
That prosperity is guaranteed by the legislation of
the land, which prevents it from the tinkering and
the blundering of incompetent and discontented poli
ticians. So long asUhe Government is in safe hands
so long will the welfare of the people be preserved,
but it would not take the Bryanites long to precipi
tate a period of financial disaster, industrial depres
sion and commercial stagnation. The very menace
of a free silver act would send gold into retirement,
$uddcn!y restrict the currency, and plunge the nation
into a state of confusion in comparison with which
the disasters of the Wilson tariff would seem like
pood times.

ORANGE FREIGHT RATES.
FROM the Los Angeles Saturday Post it is
learned that the railroad companies in their efforts
to extort from the industries of the State all the
traffic will bear have imposed upon the orange-growers
a burden in the way of freight rates that may prove
to be more than they can bear, and which in the end
may result in a serious injury, not to the orange men
only, but the whole of California.
The evil to which the Post objects is the raise in
the amount of oranges which shippers are required to
ship to make up carload lots. It is said: "This 13
a raise in the most injurious way. The object seems
to have been to make the raise in a masked form.
The shippers have added the thirty boxes the rail
roads insist on charging freights for. This over
crowds the capacity of the cars for safe carriage of
fruit, with the result of continuous and often heavy
losses from decaj\"
. If the results be as disastrous as is thus stated by
our well informed contemporary, the offense against
public welfare is one of the most serious the railroads
have committed for a long time, and earnest efforts
on the part of the people should be made to remedy
it. It is pointed out that the railroads under the
old rate took one-half of the gross proceeds of the
orange crop of Southern California, and that out of
the remaining half had to be paid the cost of man
aging, the groves, cultivation, irrigation, fertilization,
labor, taxes, and also all other costs other than freight
rates, such as picking, packing and selling. Thus the
increased burden put upon the growers seriously
menaces the profits of the industry as a whole.
Commenting upon the probable outcome of the
situation the Saturday Post says: "The railroads in
these things have made an ill-considered move that
discourages development not only in orange growing,
but in everything. To raise freight rates on a
business with reduced profits is not wise from an ex
clusive railroad point of view. The subject is of in
terest to all the people of Southern California. The
orange business brings from five to six million dol
lars a year into Southern California. In fact; taking
supplies, etc., into consideration, this crop causes
about twelve millions a year to circulate. The wel
fare of this important interest is of great moment to
merchants, railroads and all. The railroads should
in their 'own interest help rather than injure it."
The issue in the case does not affect Southern Cali
fornia alone, for an injury done to that section is
bound to have a hurtful effect upon the prosperity
of every portion of the State. All shippers should
therefore make a common cause with the orange
growers in seeking justice. United effort may attain
success where the orange-growers acting alone would
fail. This is one of the occasions where Californians
should put the strength of co-operation to the test.
POLITICAL RESPONSIBILITY
OF CALIFORNIA FARMERS
J.S . Taylor of the State Grange Appeals to Them to Elect Rep
resentatives at the Coming Primaries Who Will Look
After the Farming Interests.
The Call does not hold itself responsible for
the opinions published in this column, but
presents them for whatever value they may
have as communications of general interest.
BY J. B. TAYLOR
DITOR THE CALL: As the time
E approaches for primary elections in
this State at which delegates will
be chosen to county and Congres
sional conventions, which delegates
will have the nominating of legis
lative and Congressional candidates
In the different parties, it Is Important
that members of the grange and other
farmers in this State should use their best
endeavors to have delegates elected at the
primaries in their own party who repre
sent farming Interests and who will nom
inate such candidates to the State Legis
lature and to Congress as can be relied
upon to carry out the wishes of their con
stituents. .
Farmers, put up good, reliable men of
your own classâ men who command the
respect of the community .In which they
live, men who are able to make a good
speech and to argue and hold their own
with the shrewd, practical politician, the
man who makes politics a profession,
usually a second-class lawyer who Is In
politics for what there is in It.
If farmers ever expect to obtain legis
lation favorable to their Interests from
Congress in the shape of postal savings
banks, a national pure food law, an ef
fective anti-trust law. a law controlling
railroad charges, a law prohibiting gam
bling on grain and provisions, a constitu
tional amendment requiring United States
Senators to be elected by popular vote,
a law to secure the speedy construction
and ownership of the Nicaragua canal by
the United States Government and an in
crease in the appropriation to further ex
tend the free delivery of mail in rural dis
tricts, they must see to it that men of
their own calling are elected to represent
them at Washington.
Aside from the pending national issues
upon which thefe is an honest difference
or opinion, farmers are intensely inter
ested and practically united upon many
important economic questions. â¢ Prominent
among them Is the question of taxation.
Farmers want to know how to meet the
present high rates of taxation with de
creasing receipts from the farm. They
want to know why taxes should not be
assessed equally upon all kinds of prop
erty They want to know why olflcial
salaries under existing conditions should
be at the highest point ever reached in
this State. They want to know why the
demand for retrenchment In State ex
penditures is not heeded by our legislat
ors. They want to know why the State
Railroad Commission does not exercise
the authority given it under our laws in
preventing the railroads of the State from
raising their rates for transportation
when It suits their convenience. If this
commission cannot be made of service
to the public it should be abolished. What
service has the Highway Commission, at
an expense of over $11,000 annually, ren
dered to the State? It has failed to ac
complish anything, except to draw sal
aries and report. This commission should
be abolishea.
What necessity is there for an attorney
to the State Board of Health at a salary
Â°It Is asserted on good authority that
from $5000 to $10,000 In the shape of sal
aries can be cut off from nearly all the
State offices and their efficiency be in no
W A^d^o a iniegard to the State Unlver-
sity. While the people of California are |
disposed to be liberal in the -expenditure
of money raised by taxation for the pur- ,
poses of education, yet they demand that
such expenditure shall be applied. in an
economical manner. The Harbor Com
mission at San Francisco, according to
the report of a Senate committee ap
pointed three years ago, has been the
cause of more leaks from the public treas
ury than any other. It spent $350,000 more
on the Ferry depot than was originally
contemplated, because of the failure to In
clude the foundation in the first esti
mates. This had made It necessary to use
the money of the harbor improvement
fund, which had resulted In the stoppage
of work for several years on the sea
wall. The commission had from fifty to
seventy-live, absolutely useless employes
on the payroll. In three Instances em
ployes were carried in two capacities and
drew two salaries. There was also a pur
chasing department maintained at a cost
of $9000 a year, the purchases by this de
partment amounting to only $22,000. There
is no occasion for the employment of a
harbor police force. It being the duty of
the city tc protect the property.
Farmers, if you will nominate and elect
reliable representatives to the next Legis
lature you can reduce the amount of
money necessary to be raised by taxa
tion for State purposes by at least $500,
000, as shown above.
The salaries of the county officials of
the various counties of the State can be
justifiably reduced in many Instances,
and fees that are now paid to county offi
cials turned into the public treasury, thus
saving to the taxpayers another $500,000.
making a clear saving of $1,000,000 per an
num.
Is the farmer capable or qualified to
have a voice in the formation of laws
which are to regulate his financial inter
ests? We say yes, and he is personally
responsible for not having more tillers of
the soil in the State and national legisla
tive halls.
Grange members understand, and their
Influence Is extending to all farmers, that
they are the judges on all matters affect
ing their interests, whether they be local.
State, national or international. They
are beginning to see and feel that tbeir
sacred rizhts have been trodden under
foot of designing men. They are no
longer willing that the politician, or any
one else, should think for them and tell
them what to do. They propose to anal
yze all questions for themselves and use
their Influence in legislation. State and
national, to crystallize Into laws such leg
islation as they may find necessary to
place agricultural Interests on an equality
with the other industries of the country.
There never has been a time- In the his
tory of this country when fanners have
taken as much Interest In questions affect
ing their Interests as at present. Farm
ers have also learned to stand by and
work for and maintain their rights In the
great battles of trade and In the Inter
change of commodities. This independent,
self-reliant spirit will give new vigor and
importance to the agricultural classes and
securo for them fairness in the Inter
change of commodities and fair and Just
legislation.
The farmer recognizes that the founda
tion and perpetuity of this great republic
rest on the rights of the individual man,
whether that man is rich or poor, laborer,
mechanic, lawyer, professor, merchant or
farmer. If the rights of the individual
be surrendered or if the individual man
be robbed of his right by combinations of
men or combinations of money, or by law,
then the individual ceases to be a free
man, but exists as a slave, and the crown-
Ing glory of the republic has departed.

cess attained by them does not justify the conclusion
that a civil service school would be equally beneficial.
To fit a man for command in war, either upon land or
sea, there is required a special training widely differ
ent from that required in any peaceful pursuit. No such
radical difference of training is required for the civil
service of the Government either at home or abroad.
Our colleges and universities can be safely trusted to
fit an ample number of young nien and women for
all such positions.
It is to be borne in mind, moreover, that, notwith
standing the usefulness of the Government schools at
West Point and Annapolis, they have never been
popular. It has always been a source of complaint
that they have made our army and our navy among
the most undemocratic organizations of the kind in
the world. The graduates of these schools constitute
a caste according to their own notion, and outsiders,
however well fitted for promotion in the army, or the
navy, have been antagonized by the West Point and
the Annapolis clique.

tively, few persons have desired to enter the army or
navy as a profession, but it will be quite different if
all the civil, consular and diplomatic offices of the
Government are to be given to a class educated at \
great Government school. The average American
may not wish an office, but he delights in knowing he
may aspire to it whenever he chooses. A new regu
lation, which would shut him out of the civil service
as effectually as he is now shut out of the army and
the navy, would cause a discontent that would abolish
the school almost as soon as the effects of it began
to be felt i:'v
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL; TUESDAY, APRIL 10, 1900.
OUR FRIENDLY CRITIC.
THE Humboidt Standard returns to its kindly at
tention and rebuke of The Call in relation to
the status of the tropical islands which are sup
posed to be the gift of fate to the United States. As
a gift they have so far been much like the whip found
in the Christmas stocking of the small boy who had
expected to find sugarplums.
The Standard says that Porto Rico was a wealthy
community, able to lend money to Spain, Cuba and
San Domingo, and was enjoying itself with four Sen
ators and twelve Representatives in the Spanish
Cortes.
The Standard seems to be of the opinion tnat the
islands had all of this swept away in last year's hur
ricane. We do not see any reference to the hurri
cane in the demand made by Porto Rico for free trade
with this country. The Examiner is moving the peo
ple to mutiny and rage by a picture of Porto Rico
as a lovely "female lady," stretching her plump but
manacled arms over a pile of coffee, sugar and to
bacco, and labeled,'"Starving in the Midst of Plenty."
No explanation is offered of why the lady does not
fall to and fill up on tobacco, coffee and sugar, which
is undoubtedly the "plenty" in the midst of which
her only breakfast is pulling her belt up another hole.
Our statement that tropical people are always poor
is not disturbed by the Standard's statement nor the
Examiner's pile of sugar and things.
We deny that Porto Rico and the Philippines are
entitled of right to any privileges under the constitu
tion, and we combat, therefore, the contention of the
Bryan Democracy, including the war paint and
feathered Iroquois Club of San Francisco, that their
people are our fellow citizens. We don't want free
trade with them, nor fellow citizenship, now nor
hereafter, world without end.
Just what the Standard has to complain about in
our position we are unable to see, for that paper,
after a column of fault-finding, says that it "does
not believe that these islanders became citizens of the
United States when they were taken away from Spain.
It does not favor free trade with these islands, nor the
free importation of coolie labor now in the Philip
pines. That is what the Democrats are contending
for, and what a few assistant Democrats in Congress
are trying to help them bring about. Rather than
make citizens of this motley horde of people the
Standard would favor cutting them adrift and allow
ing any European country which is strong enough to
take possession of them. But we are not reduced to
that alternative. They may be held and taught the
art of self-government, educated and made free, un
der the fostering care of the United States,"
Now the Standard has been reading all that ex
cept the last clause in The Call for two years. Will
it explains now what it means by "made free?" What
condition precedes being made free, and while they
are under our fostering care, which they are resist
ing with tooth, nail, bolo,' machete and bamboo
spear? Are they free now, and what are they to do,
what will be their political status, when "made free"
by us?
This is a subject for exact, thinking, and not for
vague phrasing and iridescent dreams. Let the Stan
dard do a little of that kind of thinking and report
the result to these headquarters.

PREPARING FOR SERVICE
NORTH OF THE CIRCLE
General Randall â¢ Getting- Ready to
Take Command of the Military
in Alaska.
Major Green, signal officer of this de
partment and soon to be signal officer of
the Department of Alaska, has returned
to his desk in this city after a trip to
Seattle, where he has been spending a
week in making preparations for his ser
vice in the far north.
Seattle is alive with people, he says,
and there is no talk but of the gold fields
at Nome. General Randall is getting
everything ready for the summer at St.
Michael, and by the Ist of May he ex
pects to start the transport Rosecrans
to Port Valdez with men and supplies.
She will return at once and â¢by June 1
he hopes to be able to have her return
to the Arctic circle with himself, his staff
and his headquarters; also the garrison
for St. Michael and supplies enough to do
for everybody. It is certain, too, that the
transport will make another trip with
supplies before the summer is, over. Just
how many of those who go up will re
main during the winter is a question not
yet discussed.
The old camp of the volunteers next to
the general hospital is all ready for the
casuals. There are now encamped there
all the casuals of the post, and before the
week is a day older 225 more will come
from the East with four officers of the
line and a surgeon. The orders from
Washington are that all officers except
Major Lockwood. who is in command of
the casuals, shall go into tents, and as a
consequence the casual officers are Join
ing the men out on the old parade ground.
No further news of the coming of the
Third Artillery headquarters has Deen re
ceived at the Presidio, but that it is
coming is not doubted. When that does
happen. Lieutenant Colonel Eskridge,
present commandant of the post, will
probably be assigned to duty as com
mandant of the casuals.
Cheney and the steamer Presidentâ are all
being fitted out there by the Alaska Pack
ers' Association.
The strike of the fishermen-sailors will
not affect* the sailing of the fleet to any
great extent, as the canneries can get all
the outside help they want. The sailors
ship for the round trip at so much, say
$75, and are allowed to flsh while the ship
is laid up and are given a fixed rate for
each salmon caught. Now that sailors
are scarce they demand an extra sum
for each fish, but the cannery people re
fused to give it to them. A strike fol
lowed and there was some trouble in get
ting a crew for one of the vessels, but
that is ail over with now and the vessels
fitting out will sail on time.
Besides the vessels named, the ship Bo
hemia is fitting out at Spear street, the
P^cllpse and Electra at Fremont, the In
diana at Beale, the steamer Kadiak came
off the marine ways yesterday and will
sail during the week, while the St. Nicho
las is at Beale street. The entire fleet
will take north about 10.000 men, and not
one of them will bring back less than
$200, while the majority will earn between
$500 and $600 during the season.
The Gracie S in a Gale.
The pilot boat Gracie S had a hard time
of it in Saturday's blow and came in yes
terday considerably the worse for wear.
During a' particularly heavy squall the
mainmast head carried away, a big sea
broke aboard and did considerable dam
age besides nearly washing Pilot Free
man overboard. Owing to the accident
the pilot boat had to come in and yes
terday as she passed along the front she
looked like anything but the trim Gracie
S that went out over the bar last week.

Reading Lesson.
The following is the proper translation
of the French exercise of last lesson.
The student will carefully compare the
same as far as he is able, noting the dif
ference in the construction of the two
languages. It is advisable that each ex
ercise be corrected, copied and again com
pared. When all is found to be perfectly
correct, read each phrase aloud and study
it by heart:
(1) The horses of Xormandy are the fin
est in Europe. (2) The climate of thia
country is very mild. t3) It 13 milder In
our country. (4) Many persons go to
France to take the waters. (3> The* are

is that house at the corner? (7) Is that
the Grand Opera-house? (S) The vegeta

Here they give excellent meals and at
reasonable prices. (11) We are going to
have rain. (12) Do you think it will be
fine to-morrow? (13) How is your father

Note â The most Important rule In the
division of syllables in French Is that they
are divided between consonants and sel
dom between vowels. When a consonant
stands between two vowels it belongs to
the second syllable, and not to the first.
A consonant followed by "1" or "r" is
never divided. Termination of verbs al
ways marks the beginning of another syl
lable. There are a few exceptions to the
above rules, but of minor Importance. A3
for the rest, it is much the same as in
English.

Noteâ The English translation of this
exercise will be found in the following
lesson, which will be published on next
Tuesday."
These dark streaks often appear to bÂ»
branches or offshoots of the bright flash.
The differences in tone in such photo
graphs are so slight that it is impossible,
for reasons which will appear in a later
paper, to reproduce them successfully in a
newspaper. Distinctions which are per
fectly well marked on the negative would
probably not show in the printed repro
duction.
The Clayden Effect.
The cause of these dark flashes was for
some time obscure. A partial explanation
was given ten years ago by Professor
Clayden of the Royal Albert College, Exe
ter. He observed that if a plate which
had received the impression of a lightning
flash or electric spark was subsequently
slightly fogged, either by exposing It to
feeble diffused light or by leaving the lens
of the camera open, the flash or develop
ment came out darker than the back
ground. If. however, the fogging took
place before the image of the spark was
Impressed the flash came out brighter
than the background, as in ordinary pic
tures of lightning. This Is. therefore, not
the usual effect of photographic reversal.
In which a very intense light, in the latter
part of its action, undoes the work which
was performed upon the film by the first
part and blots out or completely reverses
the image. The order in which the Ughu
are used is important.
Wood's Experiments.
ThÂ© matter has been taken up recently
by Professor "Wood of the University of
Wisconsin, to find the cause underlying
the action discovered by Olayden. He re
peated Clayden's experiments and ob
tained the effect without difficulty. It re
mained only to discover the exact prop
erty to which the effect was due.
The plate obtained by Wood, which, for
reasons already given It la impossible to
reproduce here successfully, "shows a
series of spark Images, some normal, some
partly reversed, others wholly reversed.
â¢Â¦â¢â¢â¢ The sparks were all of e<lual
Intensity, but after each discharge the ris
diaphragm of the lens was closed a little.
It will be seen that the borders of the
brisrht sparks are reversed. In some the.
image is reversed with the exception of a
narrow thread down the core. The ima;es
were impressed in succession on the plate
by moving it in the camera. â¢ â¢ â¢ Of
course, the rooimwas in total darkness.
After exposure the plate was exposed to
the diffused light of a candle for a second
or two and then developed.
Other experiments appeared to show a
difference in action between two llghta
from different sources, sufficient to pro
duce the same amount of blackening or
development; but further careful work
made it evident that the time element was
the important factor, and that the effect
did not depend upon any peculiar property
of the electric spark, other than Ita ex
ceedingly short duration.
This idea was confirmed by using an aro
as a source of light. The extreme short
ness of exposure was attained by means
of a stationary and a revolving slit,
through which the light passed only when
they coincided. The plate was allowed to
fall In front of these slits, and an exposure
of 1-65.000 of a second was thus obtained.
The effects produced were exactly similar
to those obtained when the spark was the
source of light.
Wood concludes "that the action of an
intense light on a plate for a very brief
time interval decreases the sensitiveness
of the plate to light": and he says: "I
am not prepared to say what the nature
of the change effected in the plate is.
Possibly some one familiar with thÂ«
theory of sensitive emulsions can answer
the question." Experiments which. It Is
stated, are now \v nroereas may helo to
this final answer.

m. DARK LIGHTNING.
Lightning appears to us In- various
forms. It was recently classified as follows:
Forked or jagged lightning, branched
lightning, heat lightning, sheet lightning,
globular lightning, dark lightning. Forked
lightning is the usual severe kind.
Branched lightning Intertwines and chases
over the whole sky, forming an Interlaced
network. Heat and sheet lightning are
but the general illumination of the cloud
sheet from internal or distant discharges.
Globular lightning is that peculiar and In
frequent phenomenon in which a ball of
fire seems to move with comparative slow
ness or to roll about over the ground like
a. football. Persons are occasionally found
who aver that they have dodged or
jumped over these nery footballs, which
then burst. What they are has not yet
been determined, and there are not a few
people who doubt their existence. Dai*
lightningâ there is no such thing In na
ture as dark lightning. By the term
"'dark lightning" is meant a certain pe
culiar eftect often produced upon a pho
tographic film by lightning discharges.
The name is due to the fact that the pho
tographic image of a lightning flash, in
stead of being brighter than the surround
ing sky, is darker. This refers, of course,
to the print, not to the negative.
Photographs. of Lightning.
Within the last ten years it has become
more and more common to attempt to ob
tain photographs of lightning discharges.
A great many good ones have been ob
talned and they have led to the increase
of our knowledge as to the behavior of
lightning. For obvious resons these at
tempts are usually made at night. The
camera is pointed in the direction of the
storm, the lens uncovered and the slide
drawn. Then, after the occurrence of one
or more good Hashes that plate is removed
and a fresh one exposed.
Multiple Flashes.
Many Instances might be given of the
occurrence of several flashes side by aide,
sometimes as many as ten or fifteen, over
exactly similar paths. If the camera were
moved with sufficient rapidity, any se
vere Hash would produce an image some
what like this, because of ita oscillatory
character. If the camera is not moved,
however, this cannot be the cause. The
explanation is probably as follows; A sin
gle lightning discharge, in passing through
the air, heats the air very greatly- and
thereby creates a path of weakness
through which a second discharge can
pass more easily. Moreover, in the severe
portion of the storm the wind is usually
blowing with high velocity. This heated
and weakened streak in the air Is thU3
carried bodily onward, with little or no
distortion in shape for several seconds,
at least: and if the electrical action is
powerful enough, successive discharges
will pass through the same portion of air,
which has meanwhile moved onward, pos
sibly ten or fifteen feet. Such action will
produce in the photograph the effect of
a multiple flash.
Park Lightning.
In addition to the effect just mentioned,
it is often noticed that there exist, on the
same photograph, some white streaks,
images of lightning discharges of the
usual character, ana one or more fainter
streaks of the characteristic form, but
darker than the darkness of thÂ« slur.

lessons.
LESSON NO.&â HTJTTTEME LECON.
A Few Useful Hints.
1. In former lessons we gave the student
a brief outline of the article, i. c.. the defi
nite article "the." To make such import
ant parts complete we pive now the In
definite article "a" or "an," and advise
the student to compare it with the defi
nite, making sentences with such nouns
as he can remember.
The indefinite article "a" or "an" Is ex.
pressed as follows:
Before any masculine noun In the singu
lar, un, as un frere. a brother; frayr.
Before any feminine noun In the singu
lar, une, as une hOtesse, a landlady; â â¢
oh-tess.
2. Of is usually translated Into French
by "de," as
The size of the house.
Le grandeur de la malson.
gron-duhr
3. If, however, de stands before a vowel
or h mute, It is rendered by &', as: of a
(or) an dun or dune; dung; doon.
Memory Exercise.
1. Good-morning, sir.
Bonjour, monsieur;
â¢ 2. Good evening, madam.
Bonsolr, madam e; swahr.
Note.â The French do not say "good morn
ing" or "good afternoon." but always greet one
another "bonjour" (good day) or "bonsolr"
(good evening). In leaving onÂ» another at a
later hour after tapper they say 'bonne-nult"
(good night); bohnn-nwee.
3. I thank you, I am well.

ascertained that the opposition to the
scheme of making Cape Nome a sub-port
of entry is very strong. Yesterday he re
ceived a list of vessels flying: the Ameri
can flag, engaged in the Cape Nome trade
and the Alaskan trade generally that rep
resented millions of dollars invested in the
United States. Coupled with this list was
a strong protest. A summary shows that
there are 107 American vessels that will be
engaged during the coming season. Of
these the majority are steamers, so far
as this port is concerned; but the pre
ponderance of sailing vessels elsewhere
makes the footings thus: .
Total number of American vessels
engaged in the Alaskan trade from
Pacific Coast ports, 107; steamers, 4S; sail

New York Stock Market.
NEW TORK. April 9.â The etock market
made the expected response to Saturday's un
favorable bank statement by a general draw
ing in of FX-eculatlve ventures. The selling
pressure was not ijarticulariy severe in the
general market, but with the curtailment of
the buying demand, consequent upon the dis
appointment over the bank showing, the bur
den of offerings was sufficient to bear down
prices to a lower level. The higher range of
price* In London and an opening here above
Saturday's level on the sympathy did not
ha%-c the hoped-for effect of dissuading seller*.
On the contrary the higher prices bceiucu ttt
Invite profit-taking and the opening gains were
not long maintained. ' The acute depression
manifested by Sugar had an additional ln-
Caence In depressing the market. This mer
curial Industrial save evidence during the lat
ter part of the day cf being oversold, and
after having fallen nearly eight points, re
covered more than half of the decline. The
room-tradi rs who had sold the list on the
Ftrength of the weakness in Sugar were driven
to cover by this rally and the aggressive
strength developed at a few other points. As
a consequence the closirj; was active and firm
&t a level considerably above the low point
of the day. but showing net declines for the
majority of the nocks. The weakness of
SuKar in the morning caused uisms of lively
*ymj>atl]y at other points In the industrial
list. People's Gas. the Tobacco stocks and a
nuirbfr of iron and steel stocks fell away
#ar'.y from 1 to 3 points. The strength man
ifested by the New York tractions served as
an offset to this and the railroad list main
tained a condition resembling suspended ani
mation. Large inroads upon the Pacific stocks,
Pennsylvania and the grangers turned the tide
toward depression when aggressive strength
developed In Missouri Pacific. This stock
moved up to T. 4 1-: in th* late transactions on
heavy buying and Brooklyn Transit rose
buoyantly to 79ft with a stimulating eflVit
on the genera! list. Very heavy Helling orders
â¢wers attributed to Chicago account and a
sharp fall in New York exrhange at Chicago
to 35 cents diÂ»;our.t may have Jieen due to
this caure. The street was full of rumors ell
day regarding Sugar end having to do with
the rise In jince of raw sugars. Brooklyn
transit tm manipulated l>y a pool with a
preliminary tip for an advance. Disappoint
ment over the rr-riorted terms of the People's
Oas-Og3en settlement was the cause of weak
net* in People's Gas. London showed a dis
position to buy Ftocks here In spite of the
â¢stiffness of the I^ondon money market on the
taking up of another installment of the war
loan but last week's large Increase in loans
here is generally attributed to large borrow
ings for London account to carry stocks here.
Although the i-tork market weakened on the
banks' â¢howing the money market failed to
sliow any effect cf the decrease In resources
of the banks.

Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEATâ Chicago opened firmer on better
foreign advices, small world's shipments and a
decrease on passage and private cables were
bullish. Later on the market weakened un
der an Increase of 1,200.000 bushels In the visible
supply. There were fair acceptances for ex
port at Chicago and St. Louis. Broomhall
cabled unfavorable weather In France, Ger
many and Turkey. Liverpool and Paris were
both higher.
The liquidation In Corn, however, weakened
everything at Chicago. The crop reports were
unfavorable, except in the Southwest.
In the local market futures were somewhat
higher, but spot quotations were unchanged.

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO. April 9.â Wheat began the ses
sion strong. The world' 3 shipments for the
week showed a reduction of over a million
bushels and there was a moderate decrease on
passage The smallness of the Russian con
tribution to shipments was r matter of com
ment. The French Minister of Agriculture was
quoted as putting the estimate for this crop
in France under that of 1599 and reporting
increased anxiety over the outlook. Paris was
advanced equal to lc per bushel. Increased
complaints were reported from Austria and
Hungary and the India area was placed at
30 per cent under 1?99. Liverpool showed a
marked decrease and that market was strong.
Domestic tidings were of drought In the
Southwest and of unfavorable prospects In
various sections of the wheat-growing ter
ritory. With this array of considerations- in
evidence shorts covered with great activity.
May opened ft&%c to %c over Saturday's close,
at 67t?67fte to 6'hic and advanced to 67% c.
The cash demand was moderate and the an
nouncement of an increase in the visible of
2.150.000 bushels caused a reaction, which was
helped along by the break in corn and carried
May back to 06% c. Shorts covered on the de
cline, however, and a rally followed. May
recovered to 66"4i&67c, at which the market
closed strong and %Qftc over Saturday. The
Government crop report for April Is due to
morrow, but as professional views as to its
information varied its effect on the market
to-day was diflicult to discover. Many, thought
the condition would be put at 90 per cent
compared with the December .report making
the condition 97.1 per cent.
Corn was only fairly active. The market
was firm early, helped by the wheat and pro
vision strength, but the pressure of profit
seeking lots, combined with stop-loss sales
which caught the decline around 39 7 ,ic, caused
a break which was not recovered and the
close was rather weak. May closed at 40Hc.
Oats merely followed the lead of corn, dis
playing firmness early and weakness later.
May closed Vie down.
A big general demand and higher prices at
the yards were reflected; in higher prices In
the provision pit. There was considerable
nervousness over the possibility of a squeeze
and this was Influential in sending shorts to
cover. There was a wide outside demand as
well as buying by packers. Sales were mostly
made by profit-taking longs. May pork closed
10c over Saturday, May lard 15@17ftc up and
MÂ«v ribs 10c improved.

other casualties are reported. Most of the
native chiefs, however, declare themselves

Court to-day the Lodge case was put over
for one month to allow the defendant es

In Alameda County.
OAKLAND, April 9.â Elections were
held in several of the towns of Alameda
County to-day. At Emeryville there was
an effort to fight the ticket that is sup
posed to be favorable to the racing Inter
ests, but the fight did not show very much
when the votes were counted. The big
fight was between Morris H. Lane and
Harry Allen for Marshal. Lane won the
fight by a vote of 306 to 42. Charles G.
Mayborn had no opposition for Treasurer
and received 296 votes. For Clerk there
were three nominees, and the vote stood:

Murphy 16. For Trustees J. S. Emery re
ceived 259 votes. F. J. Storer 255 and M. J.
Hayes 65. Storer and Emery were elected.

surprise. The Trustees who were sup
posed to favor the municipal ownership of
the electric light plant were defeated. The
Trustees who were elected were H. F.
Eber. J. E. Quinn and M. V. Ritter. The
defeated ones are John Driver. J. F. E.
Hopper and Charles R. Jones. For Clerk.
Douglas U. Toffelmier defeated F. H. Wil
liams by 21 votes. M. Gelsenhoffer, incum
bent, defeated Manuel Borge for Marshal
by 88 votes. Joseph Hirrscher. who has
been Town Treasurer from time Immemo
rial, won against Joaquin Cunha by 63
majority. There was much personality in
the election and nothing on party lines.
GUS DEME TRIES TO SLAUGHTER WIFE AND INFANT.
OAKLAND. April 9.â Crazed from excessive drink, Gus Deme of East
Oakland made a murderous assault upon his wife and baby last night,
and his unsteady aim and the darkness are the only things that
stood between him and a charge of double murder. After discharg
ing a double-barreled shotgun at his fleeing wife and five-year-old son he
calmly went to bed with his weapon beside him. and was sleeping soundly
when he was arrested this morning.
Deme bears the reputation of being extremely abusive to his wife, espe
cially when he is under the influence of liquor. He returned to his home,
1272 East Eleventh street, shortly after midnight, much the worse for having
imbibed too freely. He dragged his wife from her bed and without any pre
liminary discussion told her he was determined to kill her, and commanded
her to pray, as she only had a few minutes more to live.
While he went to a closet for the shotgun she seized her child and ran
out of the house into the darkness of the night, closely followed by her
bloodthirsty husband. When he reached the front steps he raised the gun to
his shoulder and fired. Both charges -went wide of the mark. Mrs. Deme
sought shelter at the home of her sister, Mrs. Al White, where she remained
during the remainder of the' night. This morning she reported the matter to
the police and the arrest of her husband followed. He was held under $3000
bail for assault to murder.
"My husband was drunk when he came home," said Mrs. Deme to-day,
"and when he got into the house he shouted: 'I am going to blow my brains
out and yours, too! Get down on your knees and pray.' He started for the
gun and I tried to persuade him not to do anything rash. He got the gun
and then started for some cartridges, and without waiting to give him an
opportunity I took my child and ran outdoors with him. Gus came out on
the steps and fired at me. but none of the shot hit me. His aim was bad
because he was drunk and because it was so dark that he could not see dis
tinctly."
President David Starr Jordan returned to
day from an extended visit among the
larger Eastern colleges and universities,
where he has been sinee -the last week In
February. Since leaving Stanford Presi
dent Jordan has visited Harvard. Yale,
Columbia. Cornell, Chicago and the Uni
versities of Indiana and West Virginia.
He has also addressed several large teach
ers' conventions, as well as prominent
business men's clubs in Chicago, Boston
and New York.
In reference to his purported quotation
of Roosevelt, in which the latter was
made to compare President McKinley to
the toy chocolate man. President Jordan
said the whole story was a falsehood and
had no foundation in fact.

Mrs. John Kreling. a daughter-in-law,
was the nrst witness called by Coroner
Mehrmann. She said ehe had last seen
the deceased on Friday, March 30. He had
told her of his intended trip to Brooklyn.
Ph<? said: "My father felt very cheerful
whpn I saw him and said he would be
very glad when he could get to Brooklyn
to sell some property and finally settle
the entire estate. He was always afraid
of the water, and I do not believe would
indulge in a boat ride. He did not cay
anything of a trip to Stockton, and if he
did po it was a very unusual thing, as he
seldom went anywhere without company.
Either his nephew. Carl Kreling. or my
self accompanied him at all times, even
to the park and Cliff House.
"I believe he met with foul play, as a
valuable watch, cuff buttons and con
siderable money and papers were missing
when h!s body was found. He sometimes
carried as much as $200. He received an
injury to his head about two years ago
by being knocked down by a bicycle, but
I " do not believe it affected him in any
way.
"Antone Pfiefer. a friend of ours, told
me yesterday that he had seen my father
nn the steamer Dauntless on his way to
Stockton. He told Pfiefer that he had
to see a man in Stockton who owed him
money. Pfiefer had been in conversation
with "him and left him sleeping in a chair
at Antioch. At Antioch at 10 o'clock
Pfiefer left the steamer. He had also
spoken to Pfiefer about his proposed trip
East."
Carl Kreling. a nephew, the next wit
ness called, said he had last seen his
uncle March 2S in his room In the Bald
win Annex. He had expressed a desire to
get pome acquaintance to go East with
him. HtÂ» was very regular In his habits
and never picked up a passing acquaint
ance. Kreling could give no suggestion
as to the solving of the mystery.
Richard H. Trenouth. superintendent of
the San Francisco Candle Works at Flem
ings Po'nt. told how he had found the
body Sunday evening at 6 o'clock. There
were several abrasions on the head,
caused probably by being rolled on the
beach debris. There was nothing, he said,
about the body which indicated .murder.
Deputy Coroner Streightif said he had
found the body at Flemings Point, had
examined it carefully for any marks of
foul play and had found none. In the
pockets 30 cents and half a bottle of
whisky were all that he could find.

MAKES ATTACK
UPON SISTER
Miss May Smith Creates Ex
citement on Streets of .
Oakland.
Attempts to Thrash Attorney Lut
trell and His Client, Mrs. Cherry.
Trouble Arises Over
Civil Suit.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call
1118 Broadway, April 9.
Miss May Smith, of West Oakland made
a savage attack on her sister, Mrs.
Cherry, of Golden Gate, and Attorney Hi
ram A. Luttrell on the street this morn
ing, forcing the former to take refuge In a
barber-shop and the lawyer to retire pre
cipitately and ungracefully inside the sa
cred precincts of a saloon. The assault
occasioned considerable excitement and
has since formed a topic for public gos
sip.
Miss Smith is a handsome blonde and
was at one time committed to a reform
school for four years. Her belligerent
demonstration to-day was caused by Mrs.
Cherry's opposition to her petition for let
ters of guardianship over the persons of
their two minor sisters, the mother hav
ing died a short time ago. The case came
up for a hearing in Judge Greene's court
this morning and was continued for a
week.
Mrs. Cherry and Attorney Luttrell. who
represents her in the case, were walking
up Broadway after leaving the courtroom
and had reached the corner of Eighth
street when they were overtaken by Miss
Smith. Grasping her sister by the arm
she whirled the startled woman round and
spat in her face. Then, dropping her hold
on Mrs. Cherry, the irate girl stepped in
front of Attorney Luttrell and began to
give him a tongue lashing. At this junc
ture two ladies who had witnessed the af
fair grasped Miss Smith by the arms and
begged her to be Quiet. Taking advan
tage of this respite the lawyer seized his
client's arm and hurried her to a place of
safety.
Hardly had he succeeded in getting Mrs.
Cherry out of sight when Miss Smith, who
had shaken off the trammeling hands that
held her in restraint, again made a vig
orous descent upon him. Diving into a sa
loon Luttrell made a temporary escape
from the finger-nails of the angry woman
and later on returned to his offices.
Hardly had he arrived there when he
was summoned to a barber-shop at 904
Broadway, where he found Mrs. Cherry
imprisoned. Miss Smith was pounding
upon the doors and screaming, "I Just
want one smash at you."
Luttrell summoned a policeman, who
forced Miss Smith to leave the scene un
der penalty of arrest. Her sister will
probably swear to a warrant for her ar
rest on a charge of battery.

MRS. HEARST TO START
A NEW MUSEUM OF ART
The Generous Regent of the Univer
sity of California Undertakes
a Great Task.
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, April
9.â Mrs. Phebe A. Hearst, the woman re
gent of the University of California who
defrayed the expenses of the great inter
national competition for permanent plans
for the buildings and grounds at Berke
ley, and who has aided the university in
many other ways, has just announced to
the board of regents that she has under
taken the task of establishing a museum
of art and archaeology. Mrs. Hearst has
planned for the collection on a large scale
of objects illustrating the history of fine
arts throughout the world. Incidentally
the collections will be of great ethnologi
cal Interest, The fruits of these explora
tions will be housed in the new Fine Arts
building which will front on the great
Fine Arts Square on the south of the uni
versity grounds.
The nucleus of the new fine arts mu
seum will be supplied by collectors who
have just been appointed by Mrs. Hearst.
These collections are not to be made pri
marily as a result of excavation. In some
parts of the world excavations can no
longer be pursued by private individuals,
nor by a university, and even nations find
it difficult to secure excavating privileges.
In Italy and Greece, for example, exca
vation on a private basis is wholly impos
sible. Germany, which is extremely strong
diplomatically, through the Imperial
Archaeological Institute has succeeded in
obtaining the privilege of excavating in
Greece. By most modern nations this can
not be hoped for.
Professor Alfred Emerson, the celebrat
ed archaeologist, who is to make collec
tions In Greek art for the University of
California, will therefore devote most of
his time to journeying about Europe and
examining whatever collections are for
sale. In the possession of private owners.
In the hands of dealers In antiquities and
In odd corners he will be able to find
many treasures of classical archaeology.
BERKELEY. April $>.â Dr. H. X.
Roweil completed his autopsy upon
:hp body of F. W. Kreling at the
Berkeley Branch Morgue this even

thsi I will say Is that Mr. Kreling did not
tome to his doaih by drowning."
The inquest disclosed the fact that de

in the blow to rupture the blood vessels.
:<n<'. cause dÂ»ath. It is believed that the
person or persons who administered the
blow then tried to hide their crime by
throwing th*> body into the water, so as
to make it appear that death was by
drowning. The bruises on the head were
accounted for by the rocks surrounding
the spot where the body was found. It is
that in throwing the body over
Â¦ I the head struck the rocks and
caused the bruised condition.
The Coroner's Jury has expressed a de
sire to hear the testimony of Antone
Pfiefer. ' who is supposed to have seen
Mr. Kreiing upon the Dauntless on FriJay
:;:p!u. Mr. I'nefer has been ?<'nt for. d<>
t>ynre the fact that his story Is not thouÃht
to be of much use. Pfiefer claims to
have seen Mr. Kreling on the boat when
it reached Antioch. This does not tally
with the place where the body was found,
nor with Tts condition. l>r. Rowell says
that the body had probably been in the
water not more than two days, because it
was still fresh, and be says that it would
be impossible for a body that met death
above Antigen 10 drift to. the Berkeley
beacli in two days, and that it would take
a remarkable condition of the tides and
currents to land it on the Berkeley shore

BERKELEY, April 9.â Mrs. Hearst haa
again come to the rescue of the young la
dies of the University of California, and
will send Mrs. Dr. Ritter East to Investi
gate women's dormitories at the larger
Eastern Institutions. It is proposed to in
stitute a system of clubhouses that the
women students may become more a part
of the university and be better accommo
dated. The old Blake residence, at the
head of Bancroft way, has been secured
as the first clubhouse. Mrs. Hearst has
arranged to furnish the entire house, and
in it fourteen young ladies will make their
home. This will be used as an experiment
and if it proves successful others will be
established from time to time.
Mrs. Ritter said that several young la
dles of the university had asked that the
dormitory system be instituted. At the
instigation of President Wheeler and Mrs.
Hearst, Mrs. Ritter entered into the work
and will go East on a tour of inspection,
and the system will be modern in every
feature.

Small Comfort for Janitors.
Auditor "Wells yesterday returned the
demands of 102 school janitors to the
Board of Education without his approval.
In a communication he recites the fact
that the demands have not been signed
by the Superintendent of Schools, as ex
pressly required by the charter. The lat
ter withheld his signature because he
holds that the janitors should not be paid
out of the school fund, but by the Board
of Public "Works, which employs them.
The janitors will now be compelled to
take the matter to the courts to settle
the disputed point and get their money. â¢
WILL AVENGE HIS
SISTER'S DOWNFALL
Lemuel Campbell Assaults Edward
Barron, a Colored Youth, in the
City Hall. Corridor.
There was an exciting scena for & few
minutes in the corridor outside of Judge
Conlan's courtroom yesterday morningr-
Lemuel Campbell, a young: man, struck
Edward Barron, a colored youth, twice on
the face, closing one of his eyes.
Campbell's half-sister, Lottie Robb, a
pretty . girl not yet 17 years of age, was
arrested Saturday, together with Thomas
Sadler and Julia Kennedy, both colored,
at 34 Turk street. The girl had been liv
ing with Jack Bost, a colored barber. In
Oakland, and he had taken her to the
house on Turk street. . The charge of va
grancy against Sadler and the Kennedy
woman was dismissed by Judge Conlan
for lack of evidence, and as they left the
courtroom in company with Barron, who
was a witness for the defense, Campbell
followed them and assaulted Barron. He
was arrested by. Policeman. Rainsbury on
the charge of battery, but the Judge as
sumed the responsibility of releasing him
till this morning, and expressed his regret
that Campbell did not use a club instead
of his -fists. Barron was the claimant In
the contest over the estate of the late
Alexander Barron, millionaire, and lives
at 9 Sherwood place.' '
The girl was sent to the Magdalen Asy
lum and a warrant Was issued for the ar
rest of Bost on the felony charge . of en
ticing a young girl from her home for im
moral purposes. He was arrested In Oak
land and brought to the City Prison by
Officers McMurray and Coleman of the
Society for the Suppression of Vice.
Campbell declared ho would use a club on
Bost at- the first opportunity.

T. H. Ramsay Is Given the Initial
Judicial Appointment at the
Paris Exposition.
It la something ot an honor to be se
lected to serve tha interests of one's State
at the Paris Exposition in any executive
capacity; but to be selected to fill a posi
tion of national as well as local Impor
tance; to be the first selected from the
numerous applicants of the entire United
States is an honor so great as to shed
come of its luster on the country that pro
duces the man as well as on the man him
self.
T. H. Ramsay Is the man who received
thi3 coveted distinction and California is
the State that may boast of sending the
first representative to sit on the exposi
tion's international jury of awards.
Mr. Ram3ay is a native son and has
been identified with the fruit and vine
industries of the State ever since he left
college some ten years ago. Ten years is
a very short time for a man to acquire
such proficiency in a chosen calling that
his reputation for knowledge of any par
ticular industry becomes national. Yet
Mr. Ramsay has succeeded in accomplish
ing this difficult task and is soon to de
part for Paris, there to sit in judgment
on the vintages of a land that was fa
mous for its wines before the great nation
that send 3 him had been thought of.
The jury of which Mr. Ramsay will be
a member will confine Itself to passing
judgment on the merits of the wines and
fruit of no country In particular. It will
be international in character and will de
cide on the respective merits of all the
exhibits of fruit and wine presented at
the exposition, no matter where they
come from, j
As the decisions of this jury will result
in classifications that will mean hundreds
of thousands of dollars to the producers
some idea may bo had of tho importance
of the position and of the high qualifica
tions necessary to secure the place in
competition with the thousands of claims
that have been put forward from all over
the United States.
It is probable that Mr. Ramsay will be
the only member of this particular Jury
selected from America, as the others will
be selected from representatives of other
wine-producing nations.
Mr. Ramsay is only 27 years of age and
is. therefore, the youngest as well as the
first judge to be chosen. He has beer,
connected with various largo wine and
fruit ranches at one time and another,
but for the past two or three years has
been devoting himself to the management
of the great Stanford ranch at Vina.

DULL PLAY WOE
INTERESTING BY
NEILL COMPANY
"A Bachelor's Romance"
Opens a Season That
Gives Promise.
West's Minstrels at the Columbia.
The Tivoli Revives "The Bo
hemian Girl"â "Quo Vadis"
to Be Continued.
"A Bachelor's Romance." in. which the
Nelll Company made Its first appearance
at the California last night, is a test of
the company, but not of Mr. Nelll.
We are promised a season of eight
weeks with these players, and the Impres
sion they made at their. premier appear
ance means much to them, and a great
deal to the theater-going public They
made an Impression last night that I was
glad to see and am happy to record. It
is their merit alone that saved the play
from being tiresome, for "A Bachelor's
Romance" Is not an exciting drama and
It would not sustain our Interest unless
it were handled artistically.
Yet. in spite of its lentor, there is a
subtle charm in the genuine sentiment and
humanness of the narrative and an in
sinuating pathos that is quite captivating.
The character of David Holmes is one
of opportunity and Mr. Nelll plays it with
a reserved art that is admirable. He
misses at times the humor that exudes
from the personality of Sol Smith Rus
sell, but his characterization is symmet
rical and quietly effective.
There is restraint In his work where re
straint should be, and he declines to over
act in scenes where all actors would be
tempted and most would fall. Benjamin
Howard has a good part as Gerald
Jriolmes, the philanderer, and there Is a
modernness about the character that gives
an interesting accent to the play. Mr.
Howard acts discreetly and well and in
company with Mr. Neill promises possibil
ities that I expect to find agreeably real
ized.
There are telling touches In the charac
ter of Martin Beggs, and Emmet Shackel
ford was consistently pleasing in the role.
His humor Is quaint and his acting of the
scene In which he meets disappointment
and failure as a competitor for a literary
prize could hardly be better. It has In It
the flavor of true art.
Julia Dean is natural and refreshing,
but the role of honor ends with her. for
the rest of the company is merely medio
cre. I might except John Barton, who
makes a good deal of a small part, and
Lillian Andrews, who does a clever char
acter; but George Bloomquest is impossi
ble, and neither Miss Chapman nor Miss
Lamkin. the stock-stunner of the com
pany, seems to be aware that It Is neces
sary for them to act.
PORTER GARNETT.
The "West Minstrels.
Carroll Johnson's song, "Your Moneys
No Good," caught on at the Columbia in
great shape last evening.. There were
many other songs, but this one was a
"warm" article in the West minstrel per
formance. There was the usual first part,
and it was during this that "Your Moneys
No Good" was heard. Richard Jose sang
several songs that were encored, the prin
cipal favorite being "The Blue and the
Gray," which has a queer and ingenious
blending of songs of the northland and
the southland In the orchestral accompa
niment, and the audience wanted more of
it than Jose would sing. John P. Rodgers
sang bass songs. Fred Warren sang "I've
Got Chicken on the Brain." There were
several good things in the first part. Then
the minstrel feature was practically
dropped and the programme was filled up
with varieties. Among the great hits of
the performance were the acrobatic acts
of the Luken brothers and the musical
and other oddities .of the three Morvelles.
both of which were excellent. The final
number was "The Storming of San Juan
Hill," semi-military and somewhat musi
cal, winding up with the tableau "Admiral
Dewey at Peace." Altogether the opening
of the West season was a success. There
was variety, quantity and quality. The
crowd filled the house very well and tho
various acts went oft briskly.
Orpteum.
The Orpheum was crowded last night,
as usual, and the bill presented was a
most enjoyable ore. Among the new
comers the Empire Comedy FourâHan
vey, Cooley, . Wilbur and Fullerâ proved
the strongest attraction. Their singing is
admirable and the quiet humor inter
mingled with the songs Is catching. They
were recalled several times. Bobby Gay
lor, the well-known Irish comedian, was
greeted enthusiastically by his old-time
friends, who had gathered to enjoy his
racy talks and rollicking songs, and al
though suffering from a severe cold he
showed that- he > was as entertaining as
ever. The De Forests, whirlwind dancers,
are clever and graceful and their carica
ture of a Bowery boy and girl literally
brought down the house. Si Stebblns, a
conjuror-comedian is a novelty. He talks
amusingly and he does some wonderful
tricks with the cards with an ease that
is astonishing. Among -the hold-overs A.
L. Gullle, the famous tenor, was repeated
ly encored and it seemed as if the audi
ence could not get enough of him. Will
Matthews and Nellie Harris, In their far
cical creation, "Adam the Second"; Car
rie Behr. the singing soubrette; Vashti
Earl and Lulu Shepherd, comediennes,
and Harry Cogill and May Arlea, in their
musical comedy sketch, "A Warm
Lunch," completed the attractive bill.
Tivoli.
Balfe's pretty romantic opera, "The Bo
hemian Girl," was welcomed by an ap
preciative audience at the Ttvoll Opera
house last evening. Judging, from the ap
plause she received the hit of the evening
was made by Miss Frances Graham as
the queen of the gypsies, when she sang
"Bliss Forever Past." The lady was re
called several times. Another to receive
a full share of commendation was Will

Arnheim. Tom Greene, the proscribed
Thaddeus, also had a number of pleasing
encores, particularly In "Then You'll Re

the orchestra Is deserving of favorable
mention. "The Wizard of the Nile," by

Alcazar.
"Quo Vadls" began Its second week at
the Alcazar last night. The piece has
pleased the public and In . consequence
there was a crowded house. The actors

"James Wobberts. I. S. 8. Boston," the

CALL FOR JOINT
CONFERENCE OF
LOCAL LEADERS
Fourth and Fifth Republi
can Congressional Dis
trict Committees.
Sentiment Favorable to Open Prima
ries for Election of Delegates to
Conventions â Directions of
National Committee.
At the Palace Hotel to-morrow even
ing there will be a joint conference of the
Fourth and Fifth Republican Congres
sional District Committees. The call for
the conference is signed by Jospeh Spear
Jr.. chairman of the Fourth, and Max
Goldberg, chairman of the Fifth District
Committee. It is well understood that the
Joint committee wiil consider the question
of calling primary elections to choose del
egates to the district conventions. It has I
been suggested that the primaries in both
districts ehould be held on the same day.
The Republican State Central Committee
declined to advise the Congressional dis
trict committees on this question, as the
call of the National Republican Commit
tee clearly directed the manner of pro
cedure in tha various Congressional dis
tricts. The direction given by the National
Committee is as follows: .
The Congressional district dele
gates shall be elected by conventions
called by the Congressional commit
tee of each district in the manner of
nominating the candidates for Rep
resentative in Congress in said dis
trict.
There was some talk to the effect that
the Republican Assembly districts in
Banta Clara and San Mateo counties â
Fifth Congressional Districtâ might ob
ject to primaries on the ground of the.ex
pense incident to that method of ascer
taining the wishes of electors. J. Alva
Watt, a member of the Fifth Congres
sional District Committee however, an
nounced at the recent meeting of the State
Committee that open primaries would be
held in all the San Francisco Assembly
districts embraced In the Fifth Congres
sional District. When the Fourth Con
gressional District Committee organized
at Pythian Castle a resolution was unani
mously adopted declaring in favor of open
primaries.
Rumors come from Alamefia County
that an effort will be made in the Third
Congressional District to induce the Con
irresslor.al committee of that district to
net aside the primary plan and adopt a
system of appointing delegates to the dis
trict convention. Advocates of the ap
pointive system should Â«?tudy the provi
sions of the call issued by the National
Committee. The words, "in the manner of
nominating the candidate for Representa
tive in Congress" mean something. -In
this State the manner of nominating a
candidate for Representative in Congress
is very well known. The system of pri
mary elections to choose delegates to nom
inating conventions has received the sanc
tion of law. The candidate for Represent
ative in Congress must, in order to have
his name on the official ballot, be nom
inated by a convention composed of dele
pates chosen at a primary election. The
direction in the call of the National Com
mittee relating to the "manner of nom
inating the candidates for Representative
In Congress" cannot, in the light of cus
tom and the law, be misunderstood.
It is true that the State primary elec
tion law does not In itself apply to pri
mary elections devised to elect delegates
to conventions called for the purpose . of
choosing delegates to a national conven
tion, but" it does apply to primary elec
tions held for the purpose of electing dele
gates to a convention called for the pur
pose of nominating a candidate for Repre
sentative in Congress. It is made applica
ble to the delegate nominating convention
by direction of the National Committee.
Delegates to the Congressional conven
tions, to be chosen within the next five
weeks, will have no voice whatever in
nominating candidates for Representa
tives in Congress. The Congressional
nominations must be made by delegates
chosen at primary elections, to be held on
the second Tuesday of August next. The
Congressional district conventions under
Immediate consideration will elect two
delegates from each district to attend the
National Republican Convention at Phila
delphia on June 19. Tne delegates com
prising the various Congressional district
conventions will also assemble at Sacra
mento on May 15 as a State convention
and elect four delegates at large to repre
sent California In the Philadelphia con
vention, and also select a new State Cen
tral Committee to conduct the affairs
the campaign. . â¢ - -
The plan of creating conventions by ap
pointment is not acceptable to the voters
of the Republican party. The people want
the opportunity of participating in the
contest for delegates. For that reason
primary elections. are popular. The sys
tem received the Indorsement of legisla
tive enactment because the voters of both
political parties demanded the right ! to
choose delegates to nominating conven
tions.
About the greatest political mistake a
Congressional committee could make at
this time would be to deny to the people
tho right of choosing men to represent
them In the convention called for the pur
pose of selecting delegates to the Repub
lican National Convention. Considering
the language of the official call of the Na
tional Committee it is doubtful if . dele
pates chosen under the appointive system
would be permitted to take th^elr seats If
a contesting delegation chosen under the
primary manner should ask for recogni
tion. Â¦ Â¦ . . â¢

SYLVA'S LETTER
IS TOO MUCH
FOR MR. DUNAND
Witness Weakens Percepti
bly in His Second Cross-
Examination.
Sausalito Trustee Wanted Money as
a Eetainer After HÂ« Received â¢
the Two Hundred Dollar
Check.
Louis F. Dunand spent another day on
the stand in the Fair case now being con
ducted before Judge Troutt. " When court
j was convened yesterday morning he took
j his place in the witness chair and when
the time for adjournment had arrived he
was still there, the attorneys not having
finished tvith his testimony. Judge
Fletcher A. Cutler of Del Norte, through
the courtesy of Judge Troutt, sat on the
Judicial bench during the .forenoon and
was an attentive listener.
â¢ Dunand was not as positive in- his tes
timony as he was during the preceding
days. In regard to a letter written ;by
him to Sylva he tripped overman out
stretched rope and floundered for a time.
Pence was a bit more vigorous in his
cross-examination, taking advantage of
the shaky condition of the witness.
Much of the ground gone over yester
day was a repetition of former testimony.
Dunand's meetings with 'Mrs. Craven,
Pence, Simpton, Foote and Sylva 'were
gone over in detail. The affidavit made
by Simpton In Attorney Foote's office was
produced and Identified, the Â¦" well-worn
facts of which have all been told before.
A few legal altercations between attor
neys and the rising anger of the witness
at some of the remarks â¢of L>afe Pence
were the only relieving element to an ex
tremely dull day. , .
Pence surprised the witness by produc
ing an undated letter which was signed
by Sylva. Dunand admitted that he re
ceived It after the original check of $200
from Mrs. Craven had been received by
Sylva. Both Dunand and' Sylva had pre
viously testified that the check was draft
ed by Mrs. Craven with a view of retain
ing Sylva as her attorney. The letter puts
the lie upon this declaration. It is as fol
lows: â¢
Louis F. Dunand, Esq., San Francisco, Cal.â
Dear Sir: Having been retained by Mrs. Net
tle R. Fair as counsel and attorney in her
suit against the Fair estate 1 think that a
demand .of $250 is a reasonable amount as
a retainer inasmuch as I - may have Â¦ to ex
pend the greater part of that money in the
securing of such testimony, as may be neces
sary in the proper presentation of the case
In behalf of the plaintiff. Hoping 'that Mrs.'
Fair will agree with my views In' the premise*
I remain, yours very truly, A. SYLVA. I
Pence pressed Dunand on the part he
played in the $30,000 contract and some
strong questions were asked of the wit
ness.
"Did you know that a section of the
Code of Civil Procedure provides for the
disbarment of an attorney who lends his
name to another to act as an attorney?"
asked Pence.
"I never knew till now, your reading
of the section," responded Dunand.
"How were you going to enforce this
Hen for 430,000?"
"I never thought of it, because I did not
presume It would come to this," was the
answer.
"Had you In mind at that time, if it be
came necessary, that you would make
your oath that the contract was bona fide
and, that you would hold It out against
money collected in a judgment?" asked
Pence. ; *
"I never gave it a thought," responded
Dunand. . . Â¦-- . ..... ,
"How else would you have recovered
It?" persisted Pence. .. . - -? -.
"I never gave it a thought. .Some timÂ«
after I told Sylva that I did not think
the contract would do him any good, but
he was willing to take his chances."
McEnerney took the witness on redirect
examination, concluding without develop
ing any new facts. The case will go on
to-day, when Sylva will be put upon the
stand again.

HOT often In a big city do vice,
degeneracy and Fin flourish within
the shadows of a Hall of Justice.
Close to the new municipal build-
Ing on the corner cf Kearny and Wash
ington streets are a number of the lowest
and vilest resorts that blot this city's
Ftre^ts. They are underground for the
most part, buried beneath the sidewalks
which cover but cannot hide the obscene
exhibitions, the abandon of all show of
decency and the steeping in vice and sin
that goes on in these place unhampered
by police interference.
This Is the Barbary Coast, frequented
by men and women of the lowest degree
In the social scale. Outcasts of societyâ
women who no longer hold a respectable
place in the communityâ are the denizens
of these dives. Some of them furnish an
entertainment of such cheap and stupid
character that even the belated and igno
rant patron drops into a profound slumber.
But the show is not the drawing card in
Barbary Coast dives. The dance hall
variety, such as the resort owned by W.
M. Sears, SlOH> Kearny street, is nothing
but a polished floor; an orchestra that
sir.s nightly against all laws of music; a
bar and a man behind it, and half a dozen
women who have made no pretense of de
cency for many years. Profanity flows
from their lips with every other word and
Indecent exhibitions are given without the
aFklnjr.
The patron may enter this dive without
remission price, but he is expected to
drink. When he displays an inclination to
"buy" he is not left alone in his potations.
With a charity of heart that is illimitable,
the women, who feel that companionship
is a blessing for the man, gather about
him and show their interest in his wel
fare by drinking out of the same bottle.
It means a commission to the women.
But that Is the last thing In the world
they think of.
There is an ordinance now in effect
Â¦which prohibits women from drinking at
NORTH SIDE VARIETY HOUSE WHICH THE VICIOUS FREQUENT.
the bars. Sometimes the ordinance is ob
served, but more often it is not. "When
the female and necessary adjuncts of
these halls show a regard for the law
they line up a few feet from the bar and
then guzzle all the beer or whisky that
the patron will pay for. If the "buyer"
cares to dance, why he may have a dance
for the price of a drinkâ for two, as the
woman Is always included in dance hall
hospitality.
The cleanest, newest, brightest of all
the dance halls on the Coast is the Co
lumbia, 630 Pacific street. These qualifi
cations apply only to the outward, mate
rial appearance and not to the female
fixtures, who ply the same vocation as
their sisters on Kearny street. A dance
for a drink and a drink for a commission
Is their watchword. Whenever the drink
is bought the woman receives a brass
check. Beer is sold In this resort at 50
cents a bottle, the commission of the
woman amounting to a fair proportion.
From the dance hall to the dive, a quad
ruple extract of indecency and almost pu
trescent In moral decay. Is but a short
step in this neighborhood. Perhaps the
foulest specimen of dive in the Coast dis
trict is the North Side Variety House on
the southeast corner of Jackson and
Kearny streets. Rough pine boards run-
ning the length of the hall, with chairs
on either side and a stage at the south
end, a bar unclean, the floor covered with
slimy expectorations, and the west side
of the hall a line of boxes, make a com
posite and fit setting to the \vlckedne3S
and, foul practices that occur nightly In
this den.
The women exhibit themselves In the
boxes, "flagging" casual acquaintances
and strangers as soon as they enter the
hall. Drink Is their object, for this alone
Is the source of revenue. Soldiers and
sailors reeling under an overcharged bur
den of liquor are the subjects upon which
these harpies prey with unremitting suc
cess.
Hands that know where pockets are to
be found dip into the clothes of the un
fortunate and inebriated visitor who had
too much aboard to realize his condition,
and he is separated from his money with
out the material discomfort that would
accrue with purchases of beer for the
women.
Vying with the North Side Variety
House in foul, pestilential immorality Is
the Montana Dance Hall, 923 Kearny
street. Here hardened women and vile
men spend the night, each assisting the
other to drive their nefarious bargains
and take the money of the visitor one
way or the other If he be imbecile enough
to fall Into their tolls.
These resorts are but types of what ex
ist on the Coast. It Is an Augean stable,
easy to be made subject of a clean sweep
if the police make against it with steady
purpose. ,-â¢.Â¦â¢ I --. . â¢-.
