- It is just such . an outrageous traffic
which -is now being maintained through
a gigantic conspiracy at Hongkong.
Coolie laborers are sailing from there to
this country and are. being landed. The
exclusion law is being cheated and vio
lated, and to a degree greater than ever
befbre tn'tfte- history "of> Chinese legisla
tion. Under the remarkable Chinese ad
ministration: of : Collector Jackson another
palpable iViolationoL the act of ISB4 Is be
ing, not only tolerated but' encouraged.
I The act states- specifically 'that the evi
dence which shall entitle a merchant, stu
dent or tourist- to a landing shall be hi*
certificate In the English. â¢- Not only must
it be this but it shall be nothing else. The
coming Mongol -. must rest " entirely upon
his certificate and shall not have the right
to. introduce evidence of any. other sort.
He may, be attacked In any legal way by
the government, | but he,' can Â¦do nothing
except, show his -certificate and rest upon
it for- admission. Notwithstanding this
specific- character, of. the. provision of the
law -.Collector. Jackson has permitted In
coming "merchants; students and tourists"
toi support, their. claims and, their certifi
cates : with which clearly have
no place in the" investigation?. To pile one
Illegality upon another and to reduce the
entire matter 'to a."farce-if ,it, were not
serious these; affidavits In many instances
have, been returned to the men who made
them; thus leaving the criminal certificates.
Inadequate , in themselves -to warrant the
landing of Chinese and' now without the
tion of Collector Jackson have been vio
lated. Section 6 of the act of ISS4 is In
tended to govern the admission of all
Chinese. 'except laborers, who cpme here
ostensibly for the first time. This section
has b^en the vehicle for repeated frauds
and outrages upon the people of San
Francisco, who must suffer, through -its
violation, the presence of new hordes of
coolie laborers.
There is. now in Hongkong a regularly
established agency, created. and organized
In this city, to secure and facilitate the
admission of Chinese laborers under sec
tion 6of the act of ISS4. A traffic Is "main
tained in the Oriental city. The prices of
tne trade in evading the Federal laws are
matters, of common gossip among lawyers
in this city. The tremendous fraud jls
hardly disguised. Under authority of sec
tion t> of the act of ISS4, Chinese -"Â¦ mer
chants, students and tourists, who have
never been In the United States before,
may be landed upon presentation of a cer
tificate-'which establishes their character
and which is not only issued by the Gov
ernment of the country in which appll-'
cants reside, but which must also â¢ 'be
vised by the American Consul at the 1 port*
of departure.
While the act of ISS4 provides that any
Government may issue certificates ' to
Chinese merchants, sftidents or tourists
who 'wish 'to enter this, country, the. vital
section of the law declares that the docu
ments must be in the English language.
It docs not say that there may be an Eng
lish translation of any other . lanc-iage.
but that the certificate .Itself 'must;be'_.ln
English. In this respect there have, been

HOW THOUSANDS OF
COOLIE CITIZENS
ARE MADE.
GIGANTIC as is the evil committed
in the landing of Chinese "mer
chants, students and tourists." It is
minor in comparison with the land
ing of "native sons" of California, Tha
evil done to the people of San Francisco.
to the State and to the United States in
thi3 phase of the admission of Chinese
cannot be overestimated. Every Chinese
who is admitted to this country as a na
tive-born is entitled to a vote and to all
the franchise and elective privileges of
American citizens. Coolie 3 that have
never seen the shores of America until
they come here on a ship as" "native
sons" enter the port as American citi
zens, native sons of California, entitled
to a vote and to a participation in the af
fairs of. San Francisco. These men ara
full grown, and when they come they aÂ»-e
qualified to take part in elections, to dic
tate, as far as their numerical strength
will give them power, the character ut
our municipal government.
And Collector of the Port Jojin P. Jack
son has been admitting over one hundred
of these voters every month while he has
been In office. He has Hooded this city
with thousands of the worst of foreign,
slaves. Mongolian pariahs who. by virtue
of their admission, are American citizens
clothed with every power and privilege of
native-born citizens. During the thirty
four months of his term of office Collec
tor of the Port Jackson has made out of
Mongolian laborers, out of the very drega
of Oriental civilization, out of coolie
slaves that speak nothing but their dia
lect Jargon, thousands of American na
tive-born- citizens, full-clothed with th<Â»
power of the franchise and endowed with,
the privileges of citizenship.
The tremendous outrage of this traffic
can hardly be conceived. Its results to
San Francisco politically, socially and
commercially can hardly be estimated.
Thousands of citizens have been madi
and every one of them is a slave, antag
onistic to Western civilization. Ignorant
of Western manners and ideals and con
temptuous of Western institutions. Thou
sands of coolie laborers who at best
would have been accepted with repug
nance and the poor courtesy of compul
sion, must now be tolerated as fellow-citi
zens of equal power, equal privilege ami
equal dignity with other eltlzena. The sit
uation is one that naturally is appalling.
Under the law the admission of Chinese
who come here with the claim that they
are native sons of California is less re
strictive, more easy of evasion and more
open to simple frauds than Is admission
of any other cla3s of Mongols under tha
exclusion law. While the exclusion act
is extremely careful In reference to th&
readmission of Chinese merchants who
have been in the country, less careful but
reasonably secure under an honest ad
ministration- in reference to new-comlns
merchants, students and tourists, it is ab
solutely criminal in it 3 neglect to place
safeguards around the admission of Chi
nese who. upon landing, shall be citizen*
of the United States and voters.
When Ho Tow. the Chinese Consul Gen
eral, made a plea for a more liberal con
struction of the exclusion law he probably
had become more than safely daring and
was thinking of the tricks of a poker
game, of which more shall be said in ex
plaining the remarkable condition of af
fairs of the administration of Collector of
the Port John P. Jackson. Under the laws
of- the United States Chinese claiming to
be natlve-bonn citizens of the United
States may come here absolutely without *
papers of any sort. They arrive and their
mere assertion that they were born in
America entitles them to every right of
protection and privilege of consideration,
enjoyed by Americans.
They constitute the most dangerous
class of coolies which is assaulting the
city through the Golden Gate. The law
says that all that shall be necessary for
their admission to this country shall be
the uncorroborated testimony of two Chi
nese, who shall certify to the claims of
the incoming "native son." Collectors of
the Port who occupied office before Col
lector Jackson recognized, however lax
they may have been, how serious and
how grave a problem was presented by
these Mongolian slave "native sons." Pre
cautions were taken therefore against
their admission. They were forced to fight
their way Into the country through the
courts, where testimony is taken in a legal
manner; where the proceedings are regu
lar and where the chances of detecting
fraud are reasonably certain. The result
has been most startling to those who carÂ©
to give even casual attention to affairs
that affect the welfare of San Francisco.
It la a fact of appalling significance that
Collector of the Port John P. Jackson has
admitted to this city more "native sons"
than all of his predecessors combined. He
has made more Mongolian citizens of San
Francisco than all of those who preceded
him in office. He has clothed thousands
of slaves with the privileges and dignities
of citizenship. That there is some reason
for this remarkable condition of affairs
co one can doubt for a moment. That the
reason brings shame upon a system and
an administration of immigration and
treaty obligations is palpable. The facts
which accompany the admission of "na
tive sons." the association of a ring of
favored attorneys and their business rela
tionships are as startling as the admission
of "native son" Mongolians Itself.
When these coolie citizens come on a.
ship to this port they come, as a rule.
armed with documents which state that
they have been residents and that on a
certain date they departed from this city.
The age of the "citizens." their place of
birth and the names of their two Chinese
witnesses are sometimes also given, but.
as already given, they are unnecessary'
under the law. The "citizen" has but to
announce himself, remember the lesson
which was so well learned in China and
trust to the good-will ,of the Collector of
the Port. The lew opens the way and th*
rHERE is now in operation
in this city tlie most gigantic
Chinese ring which has ever
been organized in the United States.
Tlvousands of coolies are passing
the barriers of the Custom-house,
and are net only being landed, but
are being made native-born citizens
of California, each with a vote and
qualified to participate in the politi
cal affairs of this city and State:
During his term of thirty-four
monttis Colonel John P. Jackson, as
Collector of the Port, has landed
oi'cr ten thousand Chinese â an as
tounding record thai is absolutely
without parallel in the history of
During this period Collector
Jackson has landed over one hun
dred "native sons" a month. He has
accepted the uncorroborated testi
mony of tzi'O cooties to make of
every one of thousands of appli
cants a native born citizen of the
I 'nitcd States. By a marvelous co
incidence the last majority of these
coolie "native sons'' left this port
more than eighteen years ago, and
if each is not now a qualified voter
will sKbrtlxitoe.t
This terrible traffic, which is now
gning on. is handled bx a small
clique of laivxcrs who arc personal
friends of Collector Jackson and
Ho Vow. the Chinese Consul Gen
eral at this port. This ring of at
torneys began operations what Col
lector Jackson assumed office, and
shortly before Chinese merchants
cf this city sent' an agent to Hong
kong to manipulate a gigantic busi
ness in "merchant, Mudent and
tourist" certificates. This agency
has operated with marvelous suc
cess, and the hordes of coolies arc
pouring through the Golden Gate.
This morning The Call exposes
this tremendous ring, detailing its
organization, its development and
its audacious operations. It is in
cluded within a very narrow cir
cle. Its leading members arc Colonel
George H. Pippy, Frank V. Bell
and George A. McGowan, friends
of Collector Jackson and other Fed
eral officials. The expose of this
gigantic fraud is timely, for
the steamer China has jusl de
parted from this port, leaving
forty-nine "native born citizens of
the United States" behind her, and
tlic steamer Doric has just arrived
bringing scores more to be landed
and take their place as citizens.
CRIME IN THE NAME OF
THE EXCLUSION
ACT.
*=tt S TIE machinery through which this
; j preat army of coolies has been land
|^ ed by Collector Jackson in San Fran
cisco is of three forms, each of itself
Interesting and significant. The first of
rho three forms, and that in which there
is the least chance for fraud, contains
those Chinese merchants who were resi
dents of this country and having departed
demand now a right, under the terms of
the exclusion act and treaties, to return.
The Chinese who make this demand al
most invariably have an honest right to
do so. They return with evidence of their
merchant character and with the. testi
mony of two witnesses who cannot be
Chinese. The law is very rigid in regard
to the matter, and strangely enough asks
of the Chinese who have once been In the
United Btates and seek to return more
convincing evidence than Is exacted from
those Mongolians who do not profess ever
to have lÂ»e*-n In the country and against
whose admission It might be supposed
greater precautions would be taken.
For several reasons the first class of
Chinese therefore play a comparatively
Insignificant part in the startling revela
tions of the administration of Collector
of the Port Jackson. The testimony of
men other than Chinese must be obtained
to land returning merchants at this port.
and it Is natural that an inspection of the
records shows that the number landed Is

tigation reveals the Interesting fact that
returning merchants are the last of the
three classes to be landed, as they have

SAX FRANCISCO, FRIDAY; APRIL 13, 1900.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL
his place of residence and the official an
nouncement of his right to come to this
country under the conditions prescribed.
If the applicant be a merchant the cer
tificate must also state the character and
estimated value of his business. Not only
must these vitally important documents
be in English, but they must be vised by
the American Consul at the port of de
parture.
It is at this point that the gigantic
fravd in merchant, student and tourist
certificates begins. The American Consul
at the point of departure is required by
the law of ISS4 to make a thorough inves
tigation of the pretensions of every appli
cant before indorsing the certificate. How
this Investigation was done was illustrat
ed in the scandal of the removal of Bed
loe, the American Consul at Canton, who
was caught eight months ago charging
1100 for every one of his signatures to
merchant, student and tourist certifi
cates. The Consul's legal fee is one dol
lar. The illegal service which was ren-
a legal right, to be here and are not in
clined to receive any special attention
from the Pacific Mail Steamship Company
or from the little coterie -of favored at
torneys who handle the vast bulk of the
astounding business of landing Chinese in
the city. ,The Chinese merchants who un
der American, and treaty laws have a
right to 'land 'are not disposed to pay
fancy prices for le^al services, and are
kept waiting in, the "pen"' Until thcreprer
sentatives of the other two classes are
carted in droves Into Chirfatown.
It Is in the second class of applicants for
admission that the gigantic system of
fraud begins to show itself and the re
markable operations of the Chinese bu
reau under the administration of Collector
Jackson become apparent. By authority
of section 6 of the act of ISS4 the United
States Government permits Chinese mer
chants, students and tourists that have,
never been in the United States to land
under conditions which are clearly pre
scribed and which under the administra-
coolie laborers. "* * <f \-^5Â»- <^L Â¦/,' V 'm^T^^^El**^ 1 N^SS^^-^^ f fated.^and 'tiTa^de^f- .peStlfttaJ ew

But the little clique of attorneys which
controls the terrible of making
citizens out of coolies enjdys still greater
privileges, social and professional. They
have two powerful friendsâ HeP Vow, the
Chinese Consul General, at this port, and
John P. Jackson, Collector of Customs for
San Francisco. Some.of, these interesting
lawyers , have frequently t played poker
with Ho Vow at a downtown club and at
a Montgomery street hotel, and it is said
that. Ho Vow has found the pastime ex

The Call made a thorough investigation of the traffic as It is handled by the
ring of lawyers who control It at this i>ort. On ihe steamer China, which

ed to be "native sons" of California. These coolie "citizens." who upon land-t
ing are entitled jto vote, were traced through every phase of their exam

the Jegaradviser of Ho Vow, whose friend
and associate left this city two years ago
for Hongkong to establish an agency for
the admission of "merchants," "students"
and "tourists" of the Oriental kingdom- to
ihe United States.
Shortly after the appointment of Colo
nel John P. Jackson to the position of Col
lector of v Customs for San Francisco Col
nel George :H.. Pippy had the pleasure of
being introduced . to Ho Vow, the Consul
General "for .China at : this' port..- Ho Vow
has had a Varied and pleasant experience
with Caucasians ami he accepted 'the op
portunity of ,'Â¦Â¦ meeting - a distinguished
American'in the person of Colonel George

perhaps be remembered, that .Colonel

thousand Chinese have been landed in San
Francisco In less than, thirty-four months.
After his acquaintance with -Ho Vow
Colonel George H. Pippy entered the lu
crative business of landing Chinese. He
was uniformly successful and he has a
superb record to his credit When one of
the inspectors of the Chinese Bureau sees
the papers of an incoming Chinese "na
tive son" and remarks that "that is one
of Pippy's men" it means that a new "na
tive-born" voter of California is to go into
Chinatown and that the alarming and
disgraceful records of the Chinese Bureau
are to hold the name of another coolie
voter of the State. ' This business, which
means a menace to California and her
people, has been going on for thirty-four
months.
Colonel Pippy has never been called
upon to try his cases In court. As a mat

of tho traffic is enjoyed by Frank V. Bell,
a gentleman with a history, who poss

of Colonel John P. Jackson, Collector of
Cvstoms for this district.

made chairman and welcoming host of
the reception recently given to 'United

will be remembered also that Colonel Pip
py, in order not to neglect his other friend
and associate, Yo How, Insisted that the
Chinese; Consul General be a guest at a
dinner recently given to William H. Met
son by- that gentleman's friends. ' Metson
did not invite Ho Vow, but Colonel Fippy
insisted. The happy relations existing be
tween Ho Vow, Collector of the Port Jack
son and Colonel Pippy should be encour
aged and it was just as natural for Plppy
to enjoy the company of Ho Vow at din
ner as It is for the versatile colonel to en
joy his evenings at the Sutter-street home
of Colonel. Jackson after the heat and
worry and labor in the Chinese Bureau is
over for the day. . . .
It might have been expected that Colo

duction to Ho Vow from . Colonel J. P.
Jackson, but this was not the case. The
honor of introduction was to be dispensed
by another of Colonel Pippy's friendsâ by
Arthur Spear, the interesting son of Jo
seph S.. Spear Jr., who is Surveyor of the
Port, and the â¢' intimate associate and
friend of Colonel J. P. Jackson, Collector
of Customs. The meeting between Ho
Vow and Colonel George H. Pippy devel
oped into close acquaintance and then into
friendship, but this development probably
had nothing to do with the fact that Ho
Vow was scheming -to land as many of
his Â¦ countrymen as possible in this "city

LOCAL RING ESTABLISHES
AN AGENCY IN HONG
KONG.
SHORTLY after the appointment of
Colonel John P. Jackson as Collec
tor of the Port several Chinese
merchants held a meeting In China
town to discuss some way of Increasing
the traffic In "merchants, tourists and stu
dents," who had never been In this coun
try before, but who wished under section
6 of the act of ISS4 to enter the coumtry.
The traffic in this kind of coolies had al
ways been a profitable one ever since the
exclusion, act had gone Into operation.
Gigantic rings had been formed In this
city and agencies had been established in,
Hongkong, Canton and Macao, the three
points of departure. But there had come
a lull In the business and shortly after
Collector Jackson assumed offlce local
Chinese merchants determined to revive
the traffic. These merchants need coolie*
for a variety of purposesâ ln the trades,
in the fields and fisheries and In the shop*
Besides this, there is a good profit In
dealing in the men themselves. When *
coolie is Imported he becomes practically
the slave of the man who Imported him
until such time as the money paid to
gain the coolie admission to the country
has been repaid. The Chinese merchant
takes very good care that it Is paid and
well paid before he releases his slave.
The standard price for the admission of
a coolie laborer to this port and bis eleva
tion to the dignity of American citizen
ship is WOO. This Is looked upon naturally
as very low by those that engage In, the
traffic. One-half of this money 1Â» ex
pended In this city, $100 goes to the Pa
cific Mail Steamship Company and the re
maining $100 for expenses at the point of
departure for United States Consul
charges and other Incidentals. Consul
Bedloe of Canton used to charge $100 as
his share until his brilliant financial ca
reer was cut short eight months ago by
his removal.
The necessity for an agency at Hong
kong, at which port the agent of local
merchants la now operating. Is apparent.
Coolies that want to get Into the United
States as "merchants, students and tour
ists", under the act of ISB4 must have cer
tificates which falsely characterlzs them
as represented, and then they must be
coached to give their story upon landing
without break or contradiction. The sup
plying of the certificates and the coach
ing are. the duties of the Hongkong repre
sentatives of the conspiracy. As already
indicated, several local Chinese merchants
met and the Chinese Consul General was
apprised of the purpose of the meeting.
He. gave his consent, and two years ago
one of his personal friends. Jare Kan. a
wealthy Chinese, was sent to Hongkong
to act as the agent for the importation
of Chinese coolies. He Is acting there
now, with what remarkable success the
records of the Custom-house here show.
The gigantic conspiracy, which has been
traced In such minute detail because of
Its frightful menace to this city and State,
has brought forth .astounding results. In
the last thirty-four months thousands of
coolies have streamed into this port from
the Orient. Month after month the terri
ble hordes came and -were admitted. The
hundreds Increased Into the thousands,
until the records show that in thirty-one
months of his administration Collector of
the Port John* P. Jackson has admitted
9572 Chinese, thousands of whom the Col
lector of the Port has admitted as na
tive born citizens of this State, with an
actual or a prospective right to vote.
Such a fearful record of the admission
of Chinese coolies to this city has no pa
rallel In the history of Chinese immigra
tion since the exclusion act went Into ope
ration. It should not be understood that
all of these thousands of Chinese were
never In the State before. A few of them
and a very few were returning merchants
and had a right to land, but they cut no
figure in the terrific record which has
been made while the public looked on. Ig
norant of what was being done. Thou
sands after thousands of coolies that
neverwere In San Francisco before, never
saw the American shores before, have
been landed by Collector of the Port Jack
son, and George H. Plppy, Frank V. Bell
and George A. McGowan have acted as
the attorneys for the Chinese horde.
TEN THOUSAND CHINESE
ARE PASSED INTO
THE CITY.
BUT the records speak for themselves
to fell a story of dreadful moment
to the people of San Francisco. In
the table which follows the number
of Chinese who arrived at this port, the
number that were rejected by Collector
Jackson and the number that were ad
mitted to Ban Francisco by him are given
month by month, beginning, wtth June
1337, the first month of Jackson's service*
and ending with December, 1899, four
months ago. The table Is as follows:
TELLTALE SCENES IN THE UNFOLDING OF A CHINESE DRAMA OF FRAUD
wisdom of the Collector points out the
road.
When the Chinese ."native sons" arrive
inspectors, interpreters and stenographers
â¢of the Chinese Bureau attached to the
offlce of the Collector of the Port go
down to meet them in all state.- The "na
tives" tell their story in Chinese, which is
Interpreted, taken in short hand, tran
scribed and reproduced in long hand. The
"native" employs his counsel, the Chinese
friends of the Mongolian "citizen" give
their testimony, the inspector of the bu
reau announces his judgment to the Col
lector of the Port, who must then take
action in the case. The Collector of the
Port may admit the "native son" or defer
fiction or deny admission, in the latter
Â»a*Â« forcing the applicant to go Into the
courts on a writ of habeas corpus. In
court the greatest publicity is given, wit
nesses are examined regularly under oath
and orderly and every opportunity is
given for the detection of fraud. Every
Collector of the Port except Colonel John
P. Jackson has sent these "native sons"
to the courts. Colonel Jackson has pre
icrred to exercise his= own discretion and
land them at the rate of over 100 a month
for the thirty-four months during which
he has been in offlce.
In the wholesale admission of Chinese
"citizens" under the administration of
Colonel Jackson and by his authority sev
eral deeply significant facts deserve prom
inence. In the first place, the vast over
whelming majority of returning "native
sons" left this port iicfore June 6, ISS2.
By some remarkable coincidence they
were born in this city, remained here .with
their parents for a few years of their
tender youth and then left here on ships
which departed before June 6. ISS2. They
forgot the English language if they ever
knew it. They forgot everything in San
Francisco except the street and number
of the house in which they were born.
They forgot everything Â«lse except the
day they left, and that day was before
June 6. ISB2. They left all their families
behind them, their brothers and sisters
and fathers and mothers, upon their re
turn here.
They return now full grown men, quali
fied under the laws and constitution of
the United States with a vote, for they
have been away at least eighteen years
from their "native" land. Being away so
long, having left so early in life, they
know nothing of our customs, nothing of
our language or our manners, but they
are apt scholars and will learn quickly.
They are simply coolie laborers, who
never saw the shores of California until
they glanced at the coast from the deck
of the incoming ship that they were to
lca.Ve full qualified, perfectly endowed
citizens of the United States.
They had forgotten everything, it is
eald. except their birthplace and the date
of their leaving this port. For children of
their tender years they possess a remark
ably retentive memory to have ' retained
in their brains so long a recollection of
the day, the month and the year upon
which they sailed. But they remembered
something more of even greater signifi
cance to them. While they remember
nothing of Can Francisco, which they left
so long ago as children, while they know
nothing of our language, they have not
been forgotten. There are two of their'
countrymen waiting here to recognize
each one of them after the long separa- ,
tion. â¢ .-*~" -"â¢:-Â¦ â¢/ ' \
For every "native son" there are always
Jn this city two Chinese witnesses ready
to take oath that the claims of the "na
tive" are absolutely the truth. Eighteen
jeers have not made old men of these
.witnesses. They are as young as the
men for whom they swear. The witnesses
are examined and upon their testimony
.alone Collector of the Port Jackson makes
hi* Chinese citizens at the rate of more
than 100 a month. In previous adminis
trations it was a custom of Collectors to
refuse these precious "natives" a landing
and force them into the courts if they
wanted to come into the United States;
but now the courts are idle in Chinese
ccses. Collector Jackson has no use for
ihera. The simple, uncorroborated testi
mony of two Chinese is enough to make a
native a Californian and a Californian
native a voter and citizen of the United
States.
In the admission of Chinese the frauds
are almost exclusively committed in those
classes admitted under section 6 of the
act of ISS4 and in the admission of native
eons. During thÂ© administration of Col
lector of the Port Jackson the admission"
at Chinese under section 6 of the act of
liM has Increased from 50 to 80 per cent
and the admission of native-born citizens
from 50 to 90 per cent. Yet this alarming
Increase, coupled vith the startling fact
that the vast majority of "native-born
citizens" now being admitted left this port
before June 6. IÂ£&2, has excited absolutely
no comment.
It has struck no one that there was a
reason why these men left this port be
fore that critical day. The reason Is
timply that after June 6. ISS2, the United
States Government has a record of iden
ticatlon of every Chinese who left on any
vessel from this port, and before June
6, 188?, the Federal Government has no
record that Is worth consideration. Every
Chinese who left after June 6, ISB2, can
be traced therefore without the shadow of
dcubt. Every Chinese who left before
June 6, ISS2, is lost in an official haze. It is
cot so remarkable, consequently, that the
vast majority of the great army of "na
tive sons" which is tiling into this . city
through the hands of Collector of tnÂ»
Port John P. Jackson and a little coterie
of favored attorneys were born in this
city many years ago and left this port
before June 6. ISS2.
The gigantic fraud becomes palpable al
most at a glance. If these "native sons"
had not left Ban Francisco until after
June â¬, ISS2. they could be traced. Their
fraud would be apparent. The bureau of
information, mhlch Is established in
Hongkong, would be a useless expense.
The constant visits which favored, attor
neys make to the residence of Ho Vow,
the Chinese Consul General, would be
love's labor lost, for even the most ne
glectful of officials must expose the fraud.
The trade would be valueless. Chinese
merchants of this city would have to look
elsewhere than to China for their needed
laborers and the coolies which are pass-
Ing through the Golden Gate.
While entire official responsibility for
the landing of Chinese at this port rests
with Collector Jackson, the immediate and
preliminary supervision of the wretched
business Is in the hands of the Chinese
Bureau, an elaborate arm of the service,
which, in Its individual members, is, with
one exception, new to this .coast. The In
spector In charge is familiar with the
Chinese and their affairs only from what
he has learned on this coast. The inter
preters, assistant Inspectors and others
are under the direction of their chief. This
elaborate service was created during: the
term of Colonel Jackson and all that may
be said of it is that it has not prevented
the landing of Chinese and has done no
more than a perfunctory service which in
no sense has been investigation. When
some stray, densely stupid Â¦Mongol be
comes tangled In an absurdity, which is
very rarely the case, he is returned- to
China and learns the lesson over again.
This bureau has allowed 10,000 Chinese
slaves to pass through its hands into this
city.

stockholder in the defunct Union Savings
Bank, filed c suit In the Superior Court
to-day In which tho legality of the direc
tors of that tank to levy an assessment

STENOGRAPHER M'CALLUM
THRASHES AN ATTORNEY
Accusation of Dishonesty in Vaca
ville Courtroom Ends in a
Street Fight.
Special Dispatch to The Call. .
WILLOW'S, April 12.â News was re
ceived here to-day of a difficulty at Vaca
vllle yesterday between Frank Freeman,
a prominent attorney of this place, and
Duncan McCallum, a court reporter ot
Glenn County, which resulted in FreeÂ«
man being battered up about the head
and eyes. The trouble started in the
courtroom when a request was made that
the court appoint Mr. McCallum court
reporter. Attorney Freeman quickly
Jumped to his seat and exclaimed, "Your
Honor, I object to his being . appointed
court reporter because he is dishonest."
Mr. McCallum, in answer to this, said,
"Judge, I am at present official court
reporter of Glenn County, and have here
my credentials." Then, turning to Mr.
Freeman, he said. "In regard to my dls
honesty, that is a personal affair; we will
settle that by and by." This happened
In the forenoon. In the afternoon Free
man and McCallum met on the street and
McCallum walked up to him and said,
"You have got me down Here away from
home, among strangers, and are en^
deavoring to make a fool of me. I do
not desire to have any trouble with you,
but if you ever say I am dishonest again
I will thrash you."
This stirred the wrath of Freeman.
He shook his fist in McCallum' s face and
exclaimed, "Don't dare to talk to me in
that manner." He had no sooner Bald
this than McCallum struck him imme
diately above the right eye, knocking him
to the ground. He rushed upon him and
struck him several blows before an â¢ of
ficer could separate them. For some
time there has been ill feeling between
the two men. A year or so ago the men
were good friends, and Freeman waa in
strumental in having McCallum appoint
ed court reporter. A few months ago.
McCallum claims. Freeman asked him to
change the evidence In a case which was
being tried in the Superior Court here,
but he refused, saying he would rather
resign' his position than do such a thing.
McCallum says ever since that time Free
man has been endeavoring to have him
discharged.

superintendents and ask a settlement of
certain grievances. Hearings, they say,
were refused them and an appeal was
made to General Superintendent Harrett
at Washington and later to Vice President
and General Manager Cannon. The offi
cers of the order state that no satisfac
tion was received from these officers and
the grievances were finally taken to
President Spencer, whose secretary said
the president was too ill to consider the
matter at this time.
President Powell says the committee
men selected to represent the men have
been dismissed to the number of moro
than twenty and that dozens of members
'of the Order of Railway Telegraphers
have been discharged because of their
membership. He says the last communi
cation to the officials of the company con
tained an offer to arbitrate the differ
ences. .
In the Atlanta office of the Southern
Railway seven of the nine telegraphers
employed there have quit work. Reports
received at strike headquarters are said
to be very satisfactory. Railroad officials,
however, say the strike has caused them
no Inconvenience and has not interfered
with traffic.
SAN DIEGO, April 12.â Ackerman &
Ross of New York proved to be the
successful architects In the compe
tition for plans for the Carnegie
Public Library building, to be erect
ed here, with the $50,000 given tli3
city for that purpose by Andrew Carne
gie. There were twenty-six designs cent
in for competition, and the committee
after a caieful study of them found thum
selves confronted with problems,
the flrgt of which was/ not knowing the
names or reputations of the architects,
they could "not determine how far certain
plans vrhlcli they favored might overrun
the $!W.COO limit of expense. As the ques
tion of cort, etc., could not be submitted
to local r.rcbltects and ' contractors, the
trustees ceclded to submit the plans to a
committee in San Francisco, consisting of
Willis Polk, a non-competing architect;
Bruce Porter, whose reputation as a
mural decorator and stained-glass artist
is unquestioned, and Rev. Joseph Worces
ter, an art critic of rare discernment, and
Miss Ina Coolbrith, in her capacity of
librarian.
Mr. Porter writes that there was little
room for question after the committee had
examined the set numbered 7, adding:
"We have, of course, no means of know-
Ing who the author is nor of his executed
buildings, but this design is the work of
an artist, working with feeling and sin
cerity and with an apparent security that
would justify the trustees in putting by
any doubt of his carrying through the
building with success and knowledge. It
is one of the best designs I have ever seen
for a small library, and if you choose this
for your building, with modifications that
will suggest themselves upon considera
tion, you will have one of the notable li
brary buildings of the world."
The building is to be two stories in
height' and have a basement the full
length. The outside measurement is S6 by
75 feet and the height 50 feet. Six steps
lead from the basement to the vestibule
of the first floor, where there Is a delivery
room 25 by 40 feet in size. On the right
there is a reference room 19 by 29 feet, and
a men's magazine room of the same size;
on the left are the women's magazine
room and the children's room, each 19 by
29 feet. The book shelves are at the head
of the delivery room, and back of these is
the stack room, 22 by 29 feet in size.
There are four stories of stacks, which
have a capacity of more than 18,000 vol
umes each, or :a total capacity of 75,000
volumes.
On the second floor Is an art gallery, 25
by 40 feet, in the center of the building,
with a museum on one side and a lecture
room on the other, each 20 by 38 feet. At
the rear of the art gallery is a special
study room, 12 by 13 feet, and adjoining
this is a stack room 22 by 39 feet. The
trustees' private room is in the front of
the building. The lighting and ventilation
have received special attention at the

WHARF COLLAPSES.
Purser Paddon of the Willapa Nar-

Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C. April 12.â The recent
storms, which caused the fall of the
wharf at the Ladysmlth collieries, also
caused the collapse of the wharf of Stock
am & Dawley, at Clayoquot, one of the
more important trading posts on the west
coast of Vancouver Island. It fell during
a heavy gale on Monday while the
steamer Wlllapa was lying there dis
charging her cargo. Purser Paddon had
a very narrow escape from death. He
was standing on the wharf when it fell
and Just managed to crawl over the fall-
Ing timbers In time to clutch the edge
by the store adjoining the wharf. All
the freight stored on the wharf was lost
in the accident.
The Willapa, which brought the news,
also told of evidences of what may be
another wreck found on the coast. A few
miles from Uclulet Indians found a ship's
boat painted red inside and outside. Its
bows were broken. In the boat was a

Mothers of Soldiers Who Served in
Spanish War Even Though They
Married Confederates to
Be Pensioned.
?
WASHINGTON, April 12.â The House
to-day after a spirited debate adopted the
resolution reported from the Insular Af
fairs Committee to authorize the Secre
tary of the Treasury to designate deposi
tories in Porto Rico, Cuba and the Phil
ippines for the deposit of Government
funds. By the terms of the resolution it
applies to Cuba only so long as the island
shall be occupied by the United States.
An amendment to include the Philippines
in this provision as to Cuba, offered, as
was stated, to emphasize the desire of the
opposition not to retain the islands, was
defeated by a party vote.
A Senate bill which will permit the de
pendent mothers of poldlers or sailors of
the Spanish war, even though they mar
ried Confederate soldiers, to serve the
benefit of the general pension law, was
passed. The remainder of the day was de
voted to debate upon a resolution from
the Committee on Election of President,
Vice , President and Representatives la
Congress for a constitutional amendement
empowering the Legislatures of States to
decide whether the United States Senators
shall be elected by the Legislature or di
rectly by the people. A substitute reso
lution was offered by the minority, which
differed from the majority resolutions in
giving the States no option, but providing
that in all States the people should vote
directly for United States Senators.
Loudenslager of New Jersey called the
Senate bill to repeal section 4716 of the
Revised Statutes so far as it relates to the
dependent parents of sailors or soldiers
of the Spanish war. The purpose was to
permit the dependent mothers of soldiers
of the Spanish war to be pensioned even
If their husbands had been 'Confederate
soldiers.
"Why not repeal section 4716," asked
Gibson of Tennessee, "and let Confeder
ate soldiers who afterward served in the
Union army be pensioned?"
"No, no, called out Williams of Missis
sippi. "We don't want to pension desert
ers from the Confederate soldiers."
The bill was passed.
The conference report on the legislative,
executive and Judicial appropriation bill
was agreed to.

Burrow's of Michigan Begins His
Argument Upon the Quay Case
in Opposition to the
Senator.
?
WASHINGTON*. April 12.â An effort was
made in the Senate to-day by Morgan to
displace the present unfinished business â
the Spooner Philippine bill â by the sub
stitution in its stead of the Nicaragua
canal bill. While Morgans morion failed,
li to 33. the Philippines measure had a
narrow escape from being displaced by
the Alaskan Civil Code bill en motion of
Carter, the motion being defeated on a
roll call 22 to 24.
The feature of the day's proceedings
was an exhaustive discussion of the Quay
case by Borrows of Michigan.
Jones ol Arkansas, chairman of the
Democratic National Committee, opened
the session with a sharp retort to a
charge made against him in the House
yesterday by Oouivcr of lowa. He de-
ieiiGtcl nis action m ottering an amend
xiitnt to the A J orto Kico reuei bill, propos
ing to reiund the duties that had twen
cunectea xroiu tne people ot me island to
those who r.ad paid these duties. This
i>'juoii was attached by Dolliver of luwa
in tne House yesterday during the debate
on the l J <jrto Hico taxiit" and governmental
bill. Jones gaid he had offered nis reso
lution from tne conviction that the Gov
trument of the United States had no right
to levy any tariff duties upon products
coming from Porto Kico, and if the Gov
ernment had no such right it was com
mon honesty to give the money back to
the people irom whom it had been taken.
lie said that he was not in the confidence
cf trie sugar trust and had never looked
to see who had paid the revenues or where
this money would go. He had withdrawn
the- amendment, having become satisfied
that the whole matter should be left to
the courts to determine.
Morgan made an unsuccessful attempt
to have the Nicaragua canal bill made the
order of business for 2 o'clock on April 30.
Burrows of Michigan then addressed the
Senate on the resolution relative to the
seating of M. S. Quay as Senator from
J'ennsyivanla.
Burrows said that as a member of the
Committee on Privileges and Elections
he was called upen two years ago to con
cider the case of Henry W. Corbett. ap
pointed as a Senator by the Governor of
Oregon, and he was 'Torced to the con
clusion that the power of appointment in
that case was not lodged with the execu
tive, and a majority of the committee so
reported. The Senate sustained that re
port by a vote of 50 to IS. Since that time
h<> had seen nothing to cause him to re
verse his judgment. Then it was t^-Sen
ator Corbett; now it was ex-Senator
Quay. A change of patties certainly nught
not to produce a change of convictions."
Aftrr citing at great length the prece
dents Burrows brought forward the roll
call on the Corbett case, showing that
Perrose of Pennsylvania voted against
Corbett. and that Quay himself was
paired against him. In conclusion he
f?aid:
"And let me say to Senators of the other
View that no sooner shall you have estab
lished the doctrine contended for than
there will be a popular uprising in this
country which no power can resist or sup
press to take from State Legislatures and
Governors all power to appoint Senators

The senior Senator from South Dakota,
unable on account of Morgan's objection
to pet his resolution expressing sympathy
for the Boers before the Senate, then ad
dressed the Senate aÂ» If the resolution
were under consideration.
After an executive session the Senate at
4:50 p. m. adjourned until Saturday.

PITTSBURG. Pa.. April 12.â Without
warning and with a rush and a roar the
four-story brick building at the corner of

It was beins remodeled by Contractors

the lower floors of the rorner stnrp ami

forty-eight feet of themiddle partition had
been removed and steel girders supported

finishing touches "were being put on the

began the transfer of its stock from one
room to the other and apparently central
ized the heavy weight of the leads and
oils about the middle of the structure.
The collapse began by the second floor
breaking through, carrying with it the
two floors above, making a breach from
top to bottom through the center of the
building.
The fact that the rear portion of the
building on Second avenue did not col
lapse paved many lives. It was in that
f>art of the building that the offices were
ocated, in' which there were about ten
persons. Those who were in the rear por

ran out of the side door into Second ave

will be about $40,000.

had just completed her purchase, for
when her body and that of Salesman

collapse came so suddenly that neither
had time to move.

Jurisdiction Not Decided.
WASHINGTON, April 12.â The Supreme
Court to-day denied leave to file the peti
tion of Ramon Baez, a citizen of Porto
Rico, for writs of habeas corpus and cer
tlorarl in the proceeding against him for
violation - of the Porto Rlcan election law
by the provisional courts of that island,
Baez being now In confinement under this
proceeding. The decision was announced
by the Chief Justice, who made a brief ex
planation of the court's attitude. The
court did not enter at all upon the ques
tion of Jurisdiction or decide any of the
more important points raised by the peti
tion.
The Chief Justice said In his explanation
that the application was not made to the
court until March 26, on the eve of a two
weeks' recess. This delay was, he said.
In the face of the fact that Baez had from
December 11 to apply for relief. Because
of this delay, he said, the court's Interpo
sition would have, been unavailing if It
had taken Jurisdiction. If the writ of
habeas corpus had been Issued April 9,
the next court day after the peti
tion was presented, the imprisonment
would have expired blx days after
ward- and fourteen days before the
person having him In custody would
be required to make his return. Thus, be
fore the case could be heard upon the writ
and return, the prisoner would be no long
er in custody. He stated in conclusion
that the court was not to be understood
as intimating in any degree an opinion on
the question of jurisdiction or other ques
tions raised by the petition..
Conditions in Porto Bico.
SAN JUAN, Porto Rico, April s.âGen
eral conditions In Porto Rico remain the
same from week to week. Delegations of
country people continue to arrive at the
Governor's palace almost dally and beg
for relief. Without doubt, thousands of
Porto Ricans are destitute and: without
work. One need but glance at the poor,
ragged, barefooted peons and notice the
expression of want and destitution to be
convinced of. this fact. Nevertheless, the
situation is not quite as bad as it has been
painted. ..
At noon yesterday a delegation of poor
people from Aquas Buenos presented
themselves at the palace. The procession
was headed by four or five little girls not
over 10 years of age, two of whom carried
black flags, evidently supposed to signify
that the party was In mourning for the
ones left behind, too weak from starvation
to attempt the long journey to the capital.
The little glrla^were followed by twenty
flve women anfl one hundred men. They
were taken In at the palace by Colonel
Ho ff, to whom they presented the usual
petition, telling of want and destitution.
This Is the second delegation of the sort
from ' Aquas I Buenos j this week, the first
arriving on Monday. It might be noted in
this J connection that nearly all of these
delegations have come from this same
general district. They arrive at the palace
almost daily, and the general opinion Is
that they are directed by people with an
object in view. An army official is author
ity for. the statement that a delegation
from other sections of the island once in a
while would.; perhaps be more effective.
.When all originate in the same district it
appears rather suspicious. ...:,*
Many Rations Issued Weekly.
According to the report of the post com
mander at Aquas Buenos, â¢ under date of
March 29, over 3000 rations have been is
sued weekly from that post for over three
months. He says that there are no labor
ers idle excepting those who do not wish
to work; that there are few families with
out at least one able-bodied man; that the
Alcalde has orders that every able-bodied
man mustf be made to work for the ra
tions; that the Alcalde has failed; utterly
to have the roads repaired; although he
has had ample time, and that the Alcalde
receives ": thirty relief supply tickets
monthly. â
.The officer adds in his report that in his
personal opinion the requests for work
and provisions are simply schemes of the
Alcalde :to v provide provisions for the
lazy, idle people. The. sergeant believes
that the -petitioners are backed by a cer
tain clique of citizens of the town. Includ
ing the - Alcalde, .who desires that every
family should draw relief supplies, wheth
er or not they are destitute. He also
adds that the Alcalde In Issuing the relief
tickets allotted to him does not distribute
them to the more needy. \ Such instances

the entire Island. In many cases.. the peo
ple are; actually starving and .-. with no

r>. c.
Sir: Tha special committee appointed by you
to arrange all details Incident to tbe holding
of the national convention .en July â¢* met in
Kansas City to-day In special session. Thla
meeting: wag called on account of the destruc
tion of Convention Hall, the purpose beine to
determine whether this calamity would ne
cessitate any chance In the time or place for
holding the convention. The committee con
ferred fully with the director* of the Conven
tion Hall Company and with' the executive
committee of citizens having- the arrangements
for the convention In charge.
We find that the people of Kansas City are
determined to rebuild the hall and have It
ready for the convention by July 4; and that
the committee in charge of this matter has now
in hand, in cash available for rebuilding- pur
poses, a larger sum of money than was ex
pended In the erection of the building: which
has Just been destroyed.
The directors of the hall company have en
tered into a contract with responsible firms
and corporations for the reconstruction of the
building, the contracts requiring the work to
be completed prior to the date of the conven
tion. In each Instance the contractors have
entered Into a heavy bond, with penalties, for
the literal fulfillment of their several engage
ments. We examined these contracts, and after
full conference with the directors and architect
of the .building we are satisfied that the hall
will be rebuilt so as to fully accommodate the
convention In accordance with the original con
tract of Kansas City, and that no necessity
will arise for any change either in the time or
place of holding the convention.
We do not consider that there Is any neces
sity at this time to trouble the full committee
with the further consideration of this subject.
We make this report so that this matter may
be set at rest.

WASHINGTON. April 12.â Charles
H. Allen, at present Assistant
Secretary of the Navy, will be
the first Civil Governor of Porto
Rico under the provisions of
the bill passed yesterday by the House of
Representatives. Inasmuch as the act
takes effect on the Ist of next month,
there is but little time left In which to
outline a skeleton form of government.
Including the formation of a Cabinet. If
Is understood that the new Governor will
be taken to Porto Rico In one of the finest
vessels of the navy. '-.<-.,. ',^-v
Toward the close of the afternoon Mr.
Allen was summoned to the White House
! by" the President and the informal tender
iof the post was made. Mr. Allen returned
[ a practical acceptance. Then the Presi-
I dent and the next Governor of Porto Rico
| spent an hour in close conference respect
i ing the matters to be arranged in the im-
I mediate future. Owing to the fact that
little more than two weeks' time Inter
venes before the civil government must
' go into operation, according to the terms
of the act of Congress/ it was decided
that it would not be practicable to com
plete the Cabinet of the Governor in that
time.
Therefore Mr. Allen will go alone to
San Juan at the earliest possible moment
after Secretary Long's return to Wash
ington, which should be on Saturday next.
He will put himself in touch with Gener-al
Davis, now Military Governor of the
island, and spend a short time in ac
quainting himself with tho insular affairs
and in studying the character of the men
who present themselves to his notice as
proper material for membership of the
new Cabinet. As soon as he shall havt.
established himself and the knowledge ht
seeks Governor Allen will return to the
United States. He may leave General Da
vis In charge during his absence, but in
case it shall have been found possible to
; complete the formation of the. Cabinet or
â¢â¢even If only one member shall have been
appointed, 1 then that person will act as
temporary Governor.
In the selection of Mr. Allen the Presi
dent has had in mind the appointment of
a man of affairs and of sound business
experience, qualities which are deemed
essential in the administration of an en
tirely new government, such as is to be
erected in Porto Rico.
Allen an Able Man.
Mr. Allen is no lawyer, but legal advice
always can be had even In Porto Rico
when the occasion arises, and. in fact, the
organic act provides for a well paid At
torney General as a member of the Gov
ernor General's Cabinet.
Mr. Allen was born In Lowell, Mass., In
IS4S, and graduated at Amherst: He has
had, In addition to his business experi
ence, a great deal of legislative training.
First a member of the Lowell School
Board, he entered the lower house of the
Massachusetts Legislature in 1881, went
Into the State Senate in 18S3, and then be
came a member of the National House of
Representatives. He served through the
Forty-ninth and Fiftieth: Congresses, and
might have continued in legislative work
had he. not declined a renomination. At
the close of his Congressional career he
resumed the active control of his impor
tant business interests, and although he
became Assistant Secretary of the Navy
on Alay 9, Ih9B, succeeding Theodore
Roosevelt, hs has managed to maintain
his business connections notwithstanding
the volume of Important duties that fell
to his share in the Spanish-American war.
At present he Is the head of a firm man
ufacturing wood preservatives, a presl-.
dent of one bank, a director in another
and is largely Interested in the manufac
ture of high grade papers.
Great interest is telt in naval circles in
the personality of Mr. Allen's successor
as Assistant Secretary of the Navy. His
administration of the vast details of the
Navy Department has been extremely_
-popular,Â»and it was fully- expected that,
should Secretary Long decline to continue
through another administration in tho
Navy â¢ Department, in the event of Me-
Kinley's re-election, Mr. Allen would suc
ceed to that Important post. It is said,
however, that his assignment to the Gov
ernorship of Porto Rico does not com
pletely remove him from the field as a
Secretary of the Navy in the future, for
the most expected of him now is that he
shall inaugurate and put on a sound busi
ness basis the new government In Porto
Rico. He will return to the United States
when that important work Is accom
plished. . 1, :.'.-'

Positively That He Will Not -

Vice President.
Social rMspatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLING
TON HOTEL. WASHINGTON. April 12.â
Significant developments in connection
with the candidacy of Admiral Dewey In
dicate that . his boom is growing in
strength and that there are friends behind
the admiral preparing for a vigorous cam
paign in his behalf. i Â¦
John R. .McLean gave a dinner this
evening to the admiral and Mrs. Dewey
to meet Mr. and Mrs. Perry Belmont of
New York. Although it was largely a
6oclal affair, the fact that Mr. Belmont
has come to Washington in the interest of
the Dewey boom and that he has been In
conference with Admiral Dewey and Mr.
McLean gave the dinner more than a
mere social interest. Another significant
development is the report from Onto that
the Democratic delegation from that State
may go to Kansas City uninstrueted. Sim
ilar reports from other sections cause con
siderable uneasiness among the followers
of Mr. Bryan here. Tncre is a steadily
growing sentiment among the Democrats
who are not pledged to Bryan that Ad
miral Dewey possesses many attractive
qualities as a Presidential possibility.
Perry Belmont's Democracy nas never
been questioned. He has been a regular
attendant at Democratic national conven
tions for many years find he has been an
active and valuable worker In the party
ranks. He does not hesitate to say that
he believes the candidacy of Admiral
Dewey can be placed before the American
people in such a manner as to arouse pub
lic sentiment in his behalf. Mr. Belmont
has conversed with numerous Senators,
Representatives and other public men who
are interested in national politics and he
has found an underlying sentiment favor
able to Admiral Dewey's candidacy.
ROOSEVELT DECLINES TO
ACCEPT SECOND PLACE
President McKinley, after a conference
over the long distance telephone with
Governor Roosevelt, is satisfied that It
will be impossible to gain the consent of
the Governor to accept the Vice I'residen
tial nomination. Information to this ef
f<-ct has been passed among Republican
leaders to-day, and as a result they are
all at nea as to McKinley's running mate.
There is a disposition among some of
them to proceed with the Roosevelt boom
and endeavor tc force his nomination by
acclamation, thus; putting him in the posi
tion where he will either have to respond
to the party's call or sacrifice party In
terests for personal considerations. The
President, however, has taken the Gov
ernor at his word and is conferring with
party leaders with a view to determining
en some other man.
Governor Roosevelt, it is said, was most
emphatic in his declaration that he would
under no circumstances consent to his
name going before the Philadelphia con
vention, and said that if the nomination
were forced upon him he would be con
strained to decline it.
Governor Roosevelt will attend the na
tional convention. Senator Platt said to
day that the four delegates at large from
New York would he Thomas C. Platt,
Chauncey M. Depew. Theodore Roosevelt
and Benjamin B. Odel! Jr. It was the
original intention to keep Mr. Roosevelt
away from the convention in. order that
he mljrht not te able to protest against
the nomination which was to be forced
upon him. Learning that' this programme
was in contemplation. Governor Roosevelt
expressed his intention of being present,
even if only as a spectator, in order to
put a check upon the scheme.
As the matter now stands he will attend
the convention with the knowledge that
he is not to be considered. As a delegate
8i larpe he will be able to participate in
the proceedings of the convention, and it
is understood arrangements are being
made to have him place the name of Wil
liam McKinlev in nomination.
With Governor Roosevelt out of the Vice
Presidential contest. Republican leaders
have been energetically discussing other
available candidates. As the matter stands
to-night Representative James Sherman
of New York and Secretary Long are the
possibilities most seriously considered.

URGES THE PASSAGE OF
THE EIGHT-HOUR BILL
President G-ompers of the Federation
of Labor Before the House
Ji^v,: Committee.
WASHINGTON, April 12.â President
Gompers of the Federation of Labor made
an extended argument before the House
Committee on Labor to-day in support of
the proposed eight-hour law. Mr. Gomp
ers said the movement had. secured some
measure of success in the States and mu
nicipalities, and it was desired to have
the Government recognize it by the en
actment of the present measure. Through
some mysterious means, he said, the
words "upon public works" were put into
the Federal eight-hour law of 1592, thus
confining It to narrow limits and robbing
It of the value that Its advocates ex
pected.
The present bill, he said, was the result
of five years of thought, study and effort.
He urged that the reduction of the hours
of labor was demanded by every Interest
of the Government, which should be as
much concerned in the physical and men
tal strength of the workmen as In the
tensile strength of the steel and armor
furnished to it.

people for many months. Thousands have
been fed and the relief supply has never
run short. In Porto Rico, as in every
country, a class of people exist who will
not work so long as they may pick up
enough to .keep the spark of life aflame
without exerting themselves. This sort of
people have learned of the $2,095,000 appro
priated to Porto Rico, and many of them
nave come In expecting to receive their
share.
The condition of the laboring class will
be materially relieved in a few weeks.
Contracts for the building of nine new
roads from seacoast towns to interior
points were let a few days ago. The ap
proximate coat of this work \ ill be $600,

month, according to the contracts. It has
been estimated that nearly 10,000 men will

Thousands Need Medical Aid.
SAN JUAN, Porto Rico, April 12.â The
startling fact was recently made .public
that in many districts of Porto Rico,
where the population reaches thousands,
there is no resident physician. For in
stance Wayula. a town of 1500, must de
pend upon the simplest remedies In tho
case of Illness as there Is no physician
within call. At Utando the death rate la
80 per cent annually, and this town Is a
day's ride from Ponce through the moun
tains. If appears that physicians have
been sent to these districts, but they re
fuse to remain, largely because no town
Is able .to support one. _ As a result of
this condition of things the order pr6
viding a physician for every Â¦ 500 people
is now very difficult of enforcement, be
cause the towns reply that there is no
fund to pay for such service. This island
is one vast poorhouse and there are op
portunities for charity at every step.
Were $10,000 to be expended immediately
for medicine and medical aid it would
possibly save the lives of 3000 people. At
one time the Government considered the
feasibility of assigning a physician to
each town at an aggregate coat of JSO.OOO
per year, but the funds for such an outlay
are not available.

passengers, of whom 150 are members of
the Clark tour. The remainder of the
tourists â over 300 In numberâ are scat
tered or stranded in Europe, and great
anxiety is felt by the friends in this vicin
ity, as no passenger list will be given out
for a week, or until the vessel gets here.
The agents here report that Â£1000 ster
ling was expended In Liverpool in fumi
gating and refitting the ship befora she
sailed on her present voyage, and they be
lieve the disease is stamped out. but grave
fears are entertained that the disease may
break out again with terrible conse
quences among the 1100 now on board.
No word has yet been received in re
gard to the conductor of the excursion
coming to the relief of the unfortunate
passengers who are stranded in and about
Rome, but they will be taken care of by
the United States Consul if no other help
is available. It is believed the disease
was brought on board by those who went
to Jerusalem.

Roberts' Assurances.
In a roundabout way London hears that
Lord Roberts, when wiring to the Prince
of Wales at Copenhagen congratulations
upon his escape from assassination, added
two or three hopeful sentences portend
ing an early advance with wide reaching
combinations. Quiet assurances are pass
ed around among military men that Lord
Koberts is employing his great army ef
fectively ana that the adventurous Boer
Commandos are likely to be enmeshed.
Scraps of news â a detail here and another
there â have reached England to-night over
comparatively idle cables, but they do not
lnuminate the situation.
The Boer note to Portugal regarding the
use by the British of the Beira route for
me transportation of troops to Rhodesia
may, if the Boers act against Portugal,
lead Great Britain to land troops at Lour-
I enzo Marques. This possibility has been
seriously discussed and is referred to at
length in -the morning papers to-day.
The work of the Boer Peace Commis
sioners has begun. Mr. Fischer has asked
Italy to intervene and the Italian Minister
of Foreign Affairs, the Marquis di Vls
conti-Venosta, has replied that while he
would receive the envoys, the best he
could do would be to transmit their pro
posals to London, thus following the
course of the United States.
"Never Again," the Motto.
Sir Alfred Milner. when replying to a
deputation of clergymen in Cape Town ,
yesterday (Thursday), said: " 'Never
again' must be the motto of all thinking
and humane men. but not from lust of
conquest or a desire to trample on the
gallant if misguided. There must be no
compromise or patchwork in the settle
ment and no opportunity for misunder
standing, intrigue, the revival of impos
sible ambitions or the accumulation of
enormous armaments. The British will no
longer tolerate dissimilar and antagonis
tic political systems In a country which
nature and history have declared to be
one."
In these absolute utterances of Sir Al
fred Milner he speaks for the imperial
Government.
It is calculated that Lord Roberts now
has 214,000 effective troops, with 12,000 more
afloat or under orders. The War Office
has instructed officers not to take any
more expanding bullets to Africa for re
volvers. :r: r _*-'
Hilyard Steyn, brother of President
Steyn, in the course of an interview at
Bleomfonteln. said: "The original war
plan of the Boers was to overrun all Cape
â¢Colony, but. on becoming involved In the
sieges of Kimberley and Ladysmith, the
burghers found the design despoiled. To
this I attribute the Boer failure to con
quer the British. I expect the war to last
until Christmas." v '?.' V
The seventh month of the war is be
ginning with Eastertide and the morning
paper editorials expatiate upon the need
of soberness.
LEAVES FOR BURGHERS.
PRETORIA, April ILâ The Free State

vice has the right to send a substitute

twelve days. This is intended to meet the

SAUSALITO, April 12.â Sausalito will
from now on be more under the control
of Boss Adolph Sylva than ever before In
her history. The journeyman politician
boasts he has a cinch on the town, and

will use the power the omce confers on
him to the utmost in furthering his ne
farious schemes.

NEW YORK, April 12.â Little Conrad
Fecker. 5 years old. arrived to-day from
Bremen, his cheek 3 ruddy with the glow
of health. Five minutes after the steam
ship touched the pier the boy was the
center of a pushing, shouting, screaming
mob of 500 persons. In the center of the
throng hysterical Mrs. Fecker, backed by
her lawyer and a group of friends, vainly
tried to take the child from the arms of
his stalwart foster-father. '
Fecker breasted through the throng de
fiantly, pushed forward, brushing his as
sailants aside with one strong arm. while
on the other he held aloft the boy, who
clung about his neck and stared around
him in childish wonder.
"You shall take him from me only over
my dead body," said Fecker. The angry
wife and the determined man faced each
other. Threats, vituperation, recrimina
tion were bandied between them. Once,
when George Robinson, Mrs. Fecker's
counsel, advanced to take the lad from
the foster-father's arms, Fecker merely

SANTA ROSA. April 12.â Miss Minnie
Ducker, the 18-year-old. daughter of An
drew Ducker, a well-known and wealthy
farmer of Vallejo Township, eloped from
her home last night in company with John
R. Lopus. Lopus, who is a highly re
spected young rancher, had been secretly
courting Miss Ducker for several months,
but when the young lady's father became
a-ware of the fact he manifested great
anger. On account of religious differences
Mr.' Ducker refused to consent to the mar
riage of his daughter to Lopus and de
clared that should they wed he would kill
them both.
Some time last evening Miss Ducker left
her home and met Lopus on the road near
the house. The young man took the girl
to the residence of his mother at Perms
Grove and this morning they boarded an
early train for San Rafael. Mrs. Lopus,
to whom the young, people confided their
plans stated that her son and Miss Duck

CEREMONY PERFORMED BY
SAN RAFAEL'S JUSTICE
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL; April 12.â John Lopus
and Miss Minnie Ducker, who eloped from
Santa Rosa, gave their address on a mar
riage license secured here as Petaluma
and requested that the paper which made
them husband and wife be forwarded to
Perms Grove. The young people were de
clared by Justice of the Peace Rodden to
night'to be the most remarkable couple
he had ever met. In reply to all questions
from the Justice they maintained silence,
both refusing to tell where they came
from or where they were going. They,
drifted out of town in the same mysteri
ous manner on the 3:40 p. m. train to the
city over the California Northwestern
Company's road.
Fred Forse, station agent for the com
pany at this point, states that the twain
arrived on the 7:35 a. m. train and at
tracted his attention by their amorous be
havior. As Boon as "Cupid Graham's"
office was open for business this morning
the license was procured and Lopus and
his blushing bride-elect, who gave their
ages respectively at 23 and 20. were pilot
ed to Justice Rodden'a office by Constable
William Treanor, who was the sole wit
ness to the ceremony. It was quite evi
dent that the pair left their homes in a
hurry, as their sole baggage was a clum
sy bundle carried by Lopus. Both
peared much perturbed and shunned the
main streets, taking a roundabout route
to the train. _^
Clara County appeared for the prosecu
tion. The superintendent of the mission
was the first witness and she told In a
graphic manner the story of the breaking

CONDUCTED A LOTTERY
ON A UNIQUE SYSTEM
Chicago Detectives Raid the Office of
a Mining Loan and Invest
ment Company.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, April 12.â Central Station de
tectives raided the offices of the Montana
Mining, Loan and Investment , Company,
on the second floor of the Temple Court
building, 225 Dearborn street, this after
noon and arrested J. J. Jacobs, the man
ager, and William Grosclaus, a clerk, on
a charge of operating a lottery. The po
lice opened the safe and found several
hundred lottery tickets of 25, 50 and 73
cents and $1 denominations.
The concern, according to Jacobs, has
been doing business in Chicago since 1592.
and during a large part of that time haa
been using the United States mails. Let
ters found in the room showed that on
numerous occasions the Postmaster Gen
eral had stopped their mail.
The concern operates under a clever
plan with a view of evading the lottery
laws. The tickets are numbered and are
described as shares of mining stock. At
stated periods the company designates
certain numbers as lucky and the holders
of tickets bearing the numbers are en
titled to "loans," which, it is explained,
they are noi required to pay back.
The company Is chartered under the
laws of Montana and the capital stock it
$12,000,000, fully paid up.

LONDON". April 12.â Lord Roberts'
preparations for the advance are
apparently proceeding apace. The
country around Bloemfonteln is
fairly white with British tents, and
the enormous force under his com
mand Is growing in strength and receiv
ing a much-needed supply of horses and
mules.
On their fide, and apparently in expec
tation of an attack, the R&ers at Brand
fort are intrenching themselves parallel
to and east of the railway. They still
hold the Bloemfontein waterworks in
great force and are also strong at Water
val Drift, doubtless with the object of
keeping up communications with General
Olivier's commandos to the south.
The colonial force which is beset by the
Boers at Wepener is still holding out well.
They are carefully husbanding their am
munition, according to one story, while
the Boers are said to be short. The arri
val of Lord Kitchener at Aliwal North
may foreshadow a swift rush by the bulk
of General Brabant's division to the res
cue of their comrades, in co-operation
with the flying column sent from Bloem
fonteln to take the Eoer besiegers in the
rear.
Much admiration is expressed here at
the recent daring operations of the Boers.
In Natal the burghers, apparently flred
with the desire emulate the successes
gained by thtir brethren in the Free
State, have attempted to cut off Sundays
River camp from Ladysmith and to press
forward toward Dewdorp from Van Ree
nans Pass and toward the south by way

ADVEETISEMENTS.
It is gratifying to learn that the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has, undertaken to
stop the shooting of seagulls along our coasts, for
with the present demand for guil feathers to be used
in decorating the hats of the girls it is likely there
would be an extensive slaughter of those useful birds

A NEW CENSUS SCHEME.
BECAUSE it has been decided that the count of
the population of the United States by the cen
sus officials shall be-made this year during the
first two weeks of June a good deal of dissatisfaction
has been expressed in New York and in some other
large Eastern cities. The claim is made that a con
siderable percentage of the- residents of large cities
leave at that season of the year for the country or for
Europe, and that the percentage will be larger than
usual this year by reason of the Paris Exposition. It
is, argued that because of the departure of these peo
ple a census taken in June will not be a correct pre
sentation of the normal population of the larger
cities. .
The argument has considerable validity, though
the number of persons, who leave our cities for the
holidays is much overrated. The average American
has not yet learned to take a vacation, and even
those who delight in summer recreations content
themselves with excursions and picnics to resorts in
the vicinity of their homes. Still fhere is such an am
bition to make a showing of a large population that
the census officers have. devised a scheme for getting
ahead of the rush.

THE ARMY TRANSPORT SERVICE.
SINCE some of the more reckless opponents of
Â¦ the administration have endeavored, to fix upon
the : Secretary of War a suspicion of jobbery
or at least of wastefulness in the expenditures re
quired to provide transports for the army, it is worth
while to direct attention to the fact that the recent
statement of the Secretary showing the cost of pur
chase and equipment of the transports has completely
refuted all such charges as were made or, insinuated
against him.
The New York Marine Journal, which is one of
the best authorities in the country on matters of this
kind, warmly commends the work of the>\Var. De
partment in providing the transport service, and says:
"Those who have inspected the ships of this fleet and
know how excellently they have been adapted in every
respect for their purposes, have invariably formed a
very high opinion of them, In fact, it is very*doubt
ful whether any other nation could get together as
fine a permanent fleet of transports at as* reasonable
a cost when the nature of the work done is. con
sidered, and it is certain that no ships are better
officered or their service more admirably conducted
in all respects." .
The success achieved in providing and equipping
the transport fleet is the more pleasing to American
patriotism because it was new work for our War De
partment, and was made imperative by a sudden
emergency for which no previous preparation had
been made. 'ln no particular was there any excessive
amount paid either for. ship's or for repairs, and the
officers who had charge of the work may justly be
proud of the success attained. .

A WORD OF WARNING.
SINCE there appears a disposition in some quar
ters to avoid holding primaries for the purpose
of electing delegates to conventions called to
choose representatives from Congressional districts
to the Republican National Convention, it will be well
lot all interested to take heed of the fact that, if the
primaries be not held, an opening will be made for a
successful contest on the part of an opposing dele
gation if or.c should enter the field.
The issue is not one about which there can be any
dcubt. The National Committee, in the call for a
uztiona] convention, clearly sets forth the niethol
by which delegates from Congressional districts shali
be elected. It says: '"The Congressional district
delegates thall be elected by conventions called by
tlie Congressional committee of each district in the
n:anner of nominating the candidates for Representa
tive in Congress in said district."
The meaning of that is unmistakable. Now the
State law provides the "manner of nominating can
i\ '.ates for Representative in Congress." It says:
"All delegates to conventions of political parties for
the purpose of making nominations of candidates for
public office within this State shall be elected at
ejections to be known and designated as primary
elections, and conducted at the time and place and
r.ndcr the regulations in this chapter hereinafter
specified, and not otherwise."
That conventions to nominate candidates for Con
gress are included among those governed by the law
is made cJear in the law itself by the declaration:
"Conventions to nominate candidates for Represen
tatives in Congress, members of the Board of Equali
zation, or Railroad Commissioners, or for Senators
and Assemblymen from districts including more than
one county, will be hereinafter in this chapter desig
nated as district conventions, and a primary election
to elect de]esrates to such conventions will be herein
after in this chapter designated as a district primary-."
i-rom these provisions of the law it is certain dele-,,
gates to conventions called to nominate candidates
for Congress must be chosen at primaries conducted
under the State law; and, since the call of the Na
tionr.l Committee requires district delegates to the
National Convention to be chosen by conventions
called by the Congressional committee of each dis
trict in the manner of nominating candidates for Con
grc?< in said district, there is no possible ground on
which to base opposition to primaries.
Any attempt to provide for the election of Congres
sional district delegates to the National Convention
from this Sjate by a convention whose delegates were
not chosen under the primary law and in accord with
the requirements of the law will give an opposing
cV.ofr; tion from the district a sure victory before the
National Committee on Credentials if the opposing
dcJeprtion should be elected by a convention called in
scccrknice with the Jaw. Those who have any
thought of ignoring the primary la\v should there
fore take heed of their ways. The iaw is plain, and
those who violate it will have only themselves to
Mr.n*c if they suffer the consequences.

Normal School Trustees to be held in the
latter city. It is expected that several
important questions- relative to the con
duct of the normal schools of the State
will be considered at this meeting.
THE PARIS EXPOSITION.
SO completely is the civilized world occupied
with the war in South Africa, Russian schemes
in Asia, German naval programmes, American
expansion and industrial problems in every country
that the near approach of the opening of the Uni
versal Exposition at Paris attracts but little attention.
The press is too busily engaged in publishing battle
pictures and reports from the seat of war to give
space to illustrations of the stately palaces of art and
industry that have been raised on the banks of the
Seine, and it is but rarely that even* in the weeklies
and the magazines any extended notice of the work
is given. *, â¢
It is unfortunate that it should be so. Each suc
ceeding exposition is better and more magnificent
than its predecessor, and reveals in a thousand ways
the advance which the world has made in the attain
ments of science and the achievements of mechanism.
There will be nothing at Paris like the great court of
honor at Chicago, but there will not be lacking points
of vantage in which the new fair will surpass the
wonderful white city. There is a sentiment arising
from the consciousness that we are at the close of a
marvelous century and the beginning of an era des
tined to be even more marvelous which has stimu
lated men to make at Paris this year greater efforts
than ever ' to show what the closing century has
achieved. The civilized world, therefore, would have
profited much if events had left the public mind free
to consider the arts of peace at this time instead of
wars and rumors of war.
After the exposition opens and the brilliant series
of festivals begin it is probable popular interest in it
will grow rapidly. The French, at any rate, will do
their uttermost to make it attractive, for they have not
only a national pride but an immense pecuniary stake
in the issue. Certainly they have been lavish and lib
eral in providing for it. In the way of. cost this ex
position far exceeds that at Chicago, although that
wa? regarded at the time as something wonderful in
expenditure. According to a recent estimate over
$200,000,000 has already been expended for the ex
position, and three-quarters of that amount has
been borne by France.
The event is the more interesting because with it
there will close something more than the century.
The whole political horizon of both hemispheres, is
marked by portents of coming change. The United
States has ceased to be an isolated nation. China has
ceased to be a closed country. Russia has made a
long stride toward a dominating position on the
Asiatic side of the Pacific Ocean, and the British em
pire is engaged in a struggle which will materially
alter its relations to the world. What effects these
changes will bring about in the commercial and in
dustrial struggles of the nations no one can foresee,
but it is certain we shall not have another universal
exposition under exactly the same conditions as pre
vail now. With this Parisian pageant we close the
old time brilliantly, and the future lies before us full
of menace as well as of promise.
Dr. Benjamin Andrews, who, after leaving Brown
University, went to New York and from there to
Chicago, has taken another westward step and goes
to Nebraska to tfe president of the university of that
State. These movements are ominous, for with but
two or three steps more the erratic and contentious
scholar may descend upon us and start a ruction here.
Whether the house or apartment is likely to be closed
during the first two weeks; in June, and where the
family or some representative of it can be reached by
mail after June 1; also, the number of persons, in
cluding servants, composing the family is to be in
dicated. It is hoped in this way that a large part of
the "tens of thousands" absent may get counted in
the census to the credit of the city.
Whether similar arrangements have been made for
other cities does not appear in the report which we
find in our Eastern exchanges. It is hardly .likely,
however, that it would be confined to New York, for
all cities should be treated alike. It might be well,
however, for our officials to inquire into the matter,
for it is quite possible the favor may be .given to
cities that ask for it and not to those ; that neglect-it.:
Our summer climate is so attractive that we do not.
lose much in the way of population during the sum-,
mer holiday season, for about as many come- to town
as leave it, but, nevertheless, it is advisable to get as
full a count as we can. ?...Â«...,....
The issue is of. more importance than appears on
the face of it. It is not a question merely, of making
a big showing of population. For a number of years
past one of the salient features of the development of
civilization has been the increase of urban popula
tion at the expense of the rural districts. The extent
of the shifting of the people from the country to the
towns, will be one of the most interesting facts which
the census will reveal. It is therefore in every way
desirable that a true count be made of jhe city as
well as of the rural population. The census of 1890
was defective in many ways, and it is to be hoped thi'3
one will be more accurate and give a truer*presenta
tion of the state of the country*

THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 13, 1900.
i The report that Clark of Montana intends to â¢ re
sign his seat in the; Seriate, is hardly correct, for he
has no such seat. All that he can do in that way is
to resign himself to the situation.

if the Government had lost money by the speculation.

A STOCKHOLDER'S RIGHTâ A. O. S.,
City. A stockholder In any corporation
has a right to be informed as. to the
standing or transactions cf the corpora
tion. He has the right to go to the office
during business hours and have permis
sion to examine any or all books of the
corporation. Corporations advertise meet
ings of stockholders to give them due no
tice.
A TEACHER'S DUTYâ Subscriber, Cal.
If a teacher in one of the public schools
has any reason to inquire into the derelic
tion of a pupil that teacher should use
every endeavor to ascertain the facts, and
if the teacher takes the trouble to call
at the house of the parents instead of
summoning them to the school, there cer
tainly cannot be anything out of the way
in that.
TRADE DOLLARâ Subscriber. City. The
trade dollar was a silver dollar Issue by
the United States in 1573-74 for use in
China In competition with Spanish and- j
Mexican dollars. It was not intended for* '
circulation In the United States, though
It was made a legal tender to the amount
of $5 at the time of its issue. This pro
vision was repealed In IS7<5. Its actual
value was less than that of the standard
dollar.
FIFTEEN PER CENT GRADESâ P. J.
A., city. This department has not the
space to give the names of all the streets
north of Market that have a grade of 15
per cent or over. If you will exaYnlne the
municipal reports of 1893-94 you will find
a list of established grades, and all streets
running north and south having a rise of
42 feet or more above base line and those
running east and west that have a rise
of 62 feet or more are streets that have 13
per cent grades or more.
PEP.PETUAL MOTION'â P. M., Angela
Camp. Cal. It has long 1 since been con
ceded that there cannot be perpetual mo
tion. That means everlasting motion, and
as whatever might be devised would In
time wear out there must be a stop for*
repairs and an end to "perpetual" motion.
There is no Government reward for per
petual motion, but any one who can dis
cover a practical self-acting motor that
will run for a long time will find any
number of people who will give him suffi
cient t<J pay for his Ingenuity.
"INLAYING LIKE THE WATSONS"â
N. Z., City. A friend of this department
furnishes the followins Â«Â« the origin of
the phrase used by card players, "Playing
like the Watsons": Many years ago there
lived In Solano County,- California, three
brothers named Watson who were
"plungers" as card players. Their au
dacity In playing poker excited the won
der of every one who ever saw them play,
and when any one else played on the same
lines that they did it would causa some
one to exclaim, "Playing like the Wat
sons." Â¦, .i\...
THE HALF-FARE ORDINANCE.
ONE of the worst examples of ill-considered
municipal legislation which has been pre
sented in this city for many a day is that of
Supervisor Maguire providing that on street car lines
the maximum fare for the transportation of each
"sitting passenger" shall be five cents for a con
tinuous trip, and the maximum fare for a "standing
passenger" shall for the same kind of trip be two, and
one-half cents, and requiring that "all street car com
panies shall keep for sale and sell on their cars to
passengers, in lots of not less than two or more than
ten, tickets, to be known as 'no seat' tickets, the price
of which is hereby fixed at two and one-half cents."
This is an attempt to introduce into San Francisco
a policy of street car regulation which had its origin
among a people whose habits are widely different
from our own, and whose street car systems are dif
ferent. The Market-street Railroad Company commits
many offenses against the community and is justly
subject to much condemnation, but excessive prices
for transportation is not one of them. No city in the
world has a more rapid, more comprehensive, more
convenient or cheaper system of street car transpor
tation than San Francisco. It has been built up in
accord with the needs and the customs of our peo
ple, and any interference with the system in the way
proposed would lead to confusion and result in evils
which would far outweigh the benefits expected.
One of the notable advantages of the existing
system, is the arrangement for transfers from the lines
of one street car company to another. By that ar
rangement the two companies divide the one fare
collected for the trip over both lines. If. now, a
standing passenger be authorized to ride for two and
a half cents, and take a transfer, one of the two com
panies would have to carry him for nothing. The
inevitable result of such a rule would be to put -in
end to transfers. Instead of one fare there would be
a double fare. Thus the standing passenger would
still have to pay five cents, and so gain nothing, while
the sitting passenger would have to pay ten cent^
and thus double his expense.
The difficulty of distinguishing between the sitting
and the standing passengers for a continuous trip is
another objection to the scheme. A man who boards
a crowded car, finding no seat, pays half fare, but
within a block he may obtain a seat. Another man
finds a seat ready when he enters a car and pays full
fare, but within a block he may have out of cour
tesy to rise and give the seat to a lady. He will be
then a standing passenger, and yet he has paid full
fare.
A third objection rises from the hurry and impa
tience to get forward which is a characteristic of the
American people. If there be three or four cars in
a line every passenger will endeavor to get on the
first car. That car will be crowded so that some of
the passengers are literally hanging on the platform,
while cars that will start two minutes later are left
with hardly enough passengers to fill the seats. To
permit all these standing passengers to ride for half
fare, when they have thus of their own will chosen to
ride that way rather than wait a minute or two, would
be manifestly unfair to the companies. Moreover, it
would have a tendency to increase the number of the
impatient ones and thus lead to a further crowding of
the cars, which is already carried too far in every
American community.
Furthermore, it is to be noted that our theaters dis
miss from their auditoriums every night an aggregate
of something like io.oqo people, all of whom pour out
into the streets at about the same time. The great
majority of them desire to get home at once, and
display an even greater amount than usual of the
characteristic American "rush.' It would be impos
sible for the car companies to provide cars enough
at that particular hour to furnish seats for all. Thus
a large number of the passengers would be entitled
to half-fare, and those who paid full fare would be
exposed even more than now to the crushing and
crowding of standing passengers.
Finally, the ordinance would work a grievous wrong
upon some of the street car companies while only dis
commoding others. All of our street lines do not enjoy
the enormous traffic of the Market : street Company.
On the California-street line, for example, the cost
of transportation to the company is estimated at an
average of three and one-third cents per passenger.
To that company a half-fare for standing passengers
would mean almost a total loss of profits, while the
Market-street line, after breaking its transfer ar
rangements with other companies, would probably
lose comparatively little.
The ordinance has nothing to commend it beyond
the specious promise of cheaper fares for those who
stand, and that promise is deceptive to all who take
transfers. Thus the number who would be benefited
would be small, while the great mass of the people
would suffer. There would be a loss of the transfers
from the lines of one company to those of another, an
increase in the overcrowding of cars, a necessary re
duction in the car service of some of the lines during
the hours when travel is light, and a general disar
rangement of all those conveniences which have
made our system of street travei admired throughout
the world.

merchants, was in Hongkong plying his
trade.
But the comparison of figures between
these two administrations has only been
suggested. In the last two years of the
term of Wise 3792 Chinese applied for ad
mission at this port. In the first two years
of the administration of Jackson the num
ber of Chinese applicants for admission
was 7830â over twice the number which
had been registered under a same period
immediately preceding. Jare Kan was do-
Ing his work well. In the last two years
of Wise's term 3590 Chinese out of 3792
applicants were admitted. In the first two
years of Jackson's administration 7122 Chi
nese out of 7530 applicants were admitted.
The figures tell their own terrible story
of the ring which is making citizens out
of coolies.
And still the story has not been told. In
the seven months which follow Jackson's
second year of service 3124 Chinese applied
for admission. This number is within a
few hundred of the total number of ap
plications for the last two years of Wise's
term. Out of these 3124 applications 2750
were honored by the admission of the
coolies that made them. Month after
month "native sons" were created at the
rate of over one hundred a month. Hun
dreds after hundreds of Chinese were ad
mitted, until the aggregate on the first
year was 9572, and now It Is far past 10,000.
And Collector Jackson says truthfully
that more Chinese are leaving the port
than entering it. He neglected to say that
all who are leaving have a right to return,
and will do so. and that those that are
coming are coming by no right except
that which Is given by a clique of con
spirators. Â¦ .
FARCE OF CREATING A
NATIVE SON OF CALI
FORNIA.
fl NSTEAD of diminishing, the daring:
traffic Is increasing with alarming
J[ strides. Three ships arrive every
month from China, and each brings Its
consignment of "native sons, merchants.
! students and tourists." When the steamer
China arrived a lew days ago this paper
determined to follow the traffic In coolies
from the beginning to the end, to trace
the operations of the ring from the mo
ment the coolies landed at the dock until
they passed full-fledged native-born
American citizens Into Chinatown. The
results of that investigation are startling.
On April 3 the mob of incoming Chinese
landed at the Pacific Mall dock. They
were a motley crew, a great, staring,
wide-eyed, curious throng, gaping In won
der at new sights and scenes of a city
J they had never seen before.
They possessed none of the familiarity
which characterizes Chinese that know
I their surroundings. They were herded by
j commands as cattle would have been, but
I there were forty-nine "native sons"
j among them. These ''native sons," with
i a single exception of a boy 14 years of
j age, are full-grown men. They are ad
i mlttedly of the legal age, as they claim
that they left this port at least eighteen
years ago. They must insist that they
1 left before that fatal June 6, ISS2, or they .
I will be caught by the records which the !
i United States Government has kept ever i
! since.
One by one the coolies were checked off.
They were "merchants, tourists, students
and native 'sons." The majority of the
"citizens." of course, had no papers, as
j they need none. They are natives of this
I country-
As one of these native sons of
California passed in inspection, his
bronzed, Â»ugly face betraying stupid
wonder, he handed his name and
i characterization to Inspector Lynch of
i the Chinese Bureau. Lynch looked
j at the paper and remarked with wis
; dom as he handed the document to
Inspector Gassaway:
"That is one of Pippy's men."
It was strange that Inspector Lynch
should be able to pick one of Pippy's men
out of the motley crew, but possibly his
powers of Intuition have been strongly
developed since he learned the routine of
the Chinese Bureau. But strange as was
the remark, stranger things happened be
fore the Inspectors of the bureau had
finished a labor of several days.
It was not long before the checking of
the 137 arrivals was finished and the ex
aminations began. A majority of the
"merchants" knew nothing of the cities
from which they claimed to come. They
know only their own little shops which
they pretend to own. As their certificates
were being examined Inspector Lynch was
asked If the documents were In English
with a Chinese translation. He replied,
casually:
"Xo; they are In Chinese, with an Eng
lish translation."
Inspector Lynch Is not aware, perhaps',
that such certificates are contrary to law
and on their face Illegal. And so the ex
amination continued. A score of students,
all having cousins In Washington alley,
; were all going to the\ Chinese Mission
| School on Sacramento street. If every i
; "student" who has said that he was going
; to the Chinese Mission School actually
; went there the Institution would rival
; Berkeley In attendance. The palpa
ble fraud of the applications was so reg-
I ular and persistent that It was degenerat
! Ing irto monotony until an Incident hap
i pened to revive the inquiry into startling
| interest.
; ' Another "native son" was before
' the inspector for examination. He
â¢was a great, hulky, powerful fellow,,
who had seen hard labor in tin fields.
His high check bones almost pro
truded from his face. He was a
coolie perhaps 26 years of age and of
course had left his native land be
fore June 6, 1882. His name is Lum
Vow.
As that name was mentioned
Stenographer Thompson looked up
and remarked to Inspector Tibbetts:
"That is one of Pippy's men, I
guess."
There was no reply and the ex
amination proceeded. And now Lum
Vow, by authority of Colonel Jack
son and Colonel Pippy, is a fully es
tablished native-born citizen of the
United States, born in San Francisco,
and endowed with a vote as a citizen
of the United States. As a matter of
course Lum Vow was admitted. Hi 3
Chinese witnesses went to the bureau
a few days later, Collector Jackson
affixed the seal that makes a citizen,
and Lum Vow was carted in an ex
press wagon from* the pen on the Pa
cific Mail dock to the shop of Kow,
Kee, Jan & Co., to whom he was con
signed, at 840 Clay street.
The examination of Lum Vow was Iden
tical with that of every other ."native
son" examined. It was absurdly simple,
told nothing but the barest assertions of
nativity in this country and departure be
fore June 6. ISS2. In order that a clear
Idea may be had of the testimony upon
which Collector Jackson makes citizens
cf the United States the examination of
"another of Pippy's men" was taken ver
batim. The examination is that of Lee
Woo. and it Is the evidence that Colonel
Pippy pleads is sufficient to make a coolie
a native-born Californlan. The testimony
transcribed from stenographic notes is as
follows:
Q.â What Is your name?
A.â Lee Woo.
Q. â How old are you?
A.â Twenty-six.

A STAR PERFORMER FROM THE KENNEL OF CURTIS &. SONS.
From a photograph by J. O. Tucker, San Jose.
IN Beacon and Luxor the coursing firm of Curtis & Sons of Sin Jose
have, apparently, the' fastest greyhounds now in training. Luxor has won
many stakes without suffering a single defeat, while Beacon has placed
two valuable stakes to his credit within a month. He is a blue-colored
dog, agafnst which there is a decided aversion among coursing men. Beacon
is one of the few dogs of that color which have proved great par
formers on the field in this State. His breeding is of the best, as he is by
Skyrocket out of Buenretiro. He is by far the best of the litter and was
picked out" by Mr. Curtis while he was still a puppy. Luxor was secured in
the same manner. To the unremitting care and skillful handling they re
ceive at the hands of their owners is attributed the great showing they
have made on tbe coursing field.

It Is upon such testimony as this that
native sons" are made, but Lee Woo, for
a reason, is not yet liberated from the
pen. For several days the mill kept grind
ing. Wagon load after wagon load left
the Mail Dock and disappeared into
Chinatown, but yesterday it suddenly
stopped. The members of the ring had
discovered that their movements were be
ing watched. The clique held a confer
ence. Ho Vow was notified and yesterday
morning not a Chinese "native son,"
"student" or "merchant" left the dock.
There may be -some hope, therefore, that
they will be sent back or compelled to
fight their way In through the courts.
While they are waiting for that fear
fully ready order of release from Collector
Jackson, 200 more of their kind are being
examined on. the Doric, which arrived on
Saturday. The time Is ripe, therefore, to
kill a traffic that beyond all others is the
most dangerous and daring and menacing
ever practiced In San Francisco.
FORGET WON THE
MIDWEEK STAKE
AT INGLESIDE

From Brilliantine in .
Short Time. N
Susie After Winning Three Times on
the Short En^ Ban Unsighted
and Lost on the Third
Tie.
>
J. P. Thrift's Forget won the deciding
course In the midweek stake at Ingleside
Coursing ' Park yesterday from James
Dean's Brilliantine, in a short run of nine
teen seconds, after an undecided course.
The stake winner and the runner-up both
showed well throughout the stake.
Susie got well down on the card, win
ning three courses on the short end, and
it looked like a good chance for her to get
to the final. Against Brilliantine, in the
last tie, however, she ran unsighted up the
field, with Brilliantine lengths ahead.
After sighting the hare she ran well, but
lost by a score of 6 to 3. The hares ran
better than usual and gave the dogs a few
hard runs, the course between False Flat
terer and Banner Bright. Tod Sloan and
Swinnerton, Beer Brewer and Silver Cloud
being of the long order. In the latter
course the hare escaped, after an exciting
run." Following are the day's results, with

The foregoing table may be better un
deretood when studied in comparison with
another which shows the arrival, rejection
and admission of Chinese during the last
two years of the administration of John
H. Wise, the predecessor of Colonel J. P.
Jackson as Collector of the Port. The ad
ministration of. John H. Wise in reference
to the admission of Chinese was not
famous for its strictness, but the differ
ence between it and that of Jackson is as
startling as are other details of this, the
most gigantic and far-reaching Chinese
ring that was ever organized and operated
in California, or anywhere else in the
United States.
The table which chows the traffic in Chi
r.ese for the last two years of the"admin
istration of Wise is as follows:
The forepojng- tables \rtll show what has
been done by the local Chinese rlnj? under
the administration of Colonel John P.
Jackson. Collector of the Port. It will be
noticed that immediately after Colonel
Jackson took office the Immigration of
Chinese to this port increased with re
rr.arkab!e Jumps. During the last two
years of the administration of Wise the
hiph water mark in the number of Chinese
applicants for admission in any month
was 345. The first month of the adminis
tration of Jackson the number of appli
cants was 212. The number then increased
to 452. then to Â£40. then to CÂ«4 in a single
month. Jare Kan, the friend of Ho Vow

COAST JOBBERS
THINK VICTORY
IS ASSURED
Interstate Cojmmerce Com
mission Adjourns Its
Session.
Attorneys for the St. Louis League
Wish to Offer Testimony, in
Rebuttal at the Oral
Hearing.
SEATTLE, April 12.â The Interstate
Commerce Commission to-day concluded
its hearing of testimony and investigation
in the suit brought before that body by
the jobbers of the Middle West and the St.
Louis Business Men's League against the
Pacific Coast railroad lines to compel the
re-establishmetrt of freight rates and clas
sification to this territory as they were
prior to June, IS9S. The commission left
to-night for Denver and Omaha to take
testimony in similar cases.
Commissioner Joseph W. Fife of Illinois
says the commission has received notice
from the attorneys for the St Louis
League that at the oral hearing of attor
neys they wish to present some evidence
rebutting a portion given on the coast
Just when this hearing will take place,
he says, cannot now be determined, as the
commission has a large amount of work
to be disposed of before the Middle West
and Pacinc Coast jobbers' controversy can
be taken up again. The decision of the
commission in the matter, he believes, will
therefore be delayed for some time.
The testimony taken in the four Pacific
Coast sittings will make between 2500 and
3000 typewritten pages.
The Pacific Coast Jobbers' Association
Is well satisfied with the showing made
by its witnesses, and the general belief
is expressed that tacts and figures have
been presented to the commission - that
will permanently thwart the designs of
the Middle West Jobbers to invade this
territory on a basis that is considered by
coast jobbing houses unfair, unjust and
wholly without warrant or merit.

teachers of this city.
H. Weinetock presided and G. W . Beat
tie acted as secretary. The sub commit
tee submitted an elaborate programme,
which was well received, aithough a prop
osition to have the Superintendent of Pub
lic Education nominated by an educa
tional body instead of by a party conven- ,
tion was referred back.
Several speakers took the ground that
to urge that measure might prejudice all
the others. All measures went over to a
meeting which will be called by the chair
to prepare bills, probably with the aid of
the Code Commission.
The entire forenoon was occupied in
petting into shape a plan for the certifi
cation of teachers. Tne following provis- |
ions were adopted: No teachc shall i
teach in any public school whose certifl- |
cate is of a lowt-r grade than the class to
be taught; the State Board of Education
to have discretion in special cases, but
the requirements of the certificates for
high school teachers to tx? equivalent to
those who are certified by the university j
feu teachers; high school certificates to be
issued only ujion the credentials of the
Stat* Board of Education, by county
boards, who will give high school certifi
cates, and elementary school certificates,
the latter being based upon either Cali
fornia State Normal School diplomas, nor
mal school diplomas from other States or j
elementary certificates from another !
county in California: the county boards i
to also issue kindergarten, primary cer- j
tificatcs and special certificates for tech- j
niral and othfr special branches of study. |
The qualifications of applicants for ele- *
mentary school certificates were defined j
sncl it was recommended that the State .
Hoard discontinue the issuance of edu- |
catinaal diplomas of the high school |
KT&de and of the prrammar grade.
The report concerning the certification j
of Teachers was made by Robert Furlong !
of San Rafael, chairman of the sub-cor- I
mlttee. and a supplementary report was '
filed by G. W. Beattie. He said there were ;
llj>6 persons provided with high school |
certificates and for the remaining 6943 po- ;
eitions there Is an army of ll.bTO certified ,
teachers available. The recommendations j
In 1990 will probably exceed 2-X* and there i
will be â¬00 professionally trained teachers
per year from the two universities and J
the five State Normal schools before any
charge in the certificating laws can be- |
come operative. Discussion was carried j
on by Professor Brown. Will S. Green, G. I
W. Beattie. Messrs. Sackett. Cubberly, j
I>inscott. Superintendent Webster, Presl- j
dr-nts Wheeler and Jordan and others, j
When the vote was taken on the whole. ,
section by section, there was no dissent- i
Ir.c voice.
During the afternoon rapid prorress was I
made. The most important action taken i
was to recommend the adoption of an ;
amradment to the constitution of the
State as follows:
The public ecfc<x>l system thaJl Include prl- |
mary and grarr.rr.ar Fchor.U and such hlt;h
schoola. ever.'r.c schools, normal schools and
technical *cho<~.l* a* may be establlefceil by the j
Ij'ffiFlatui* or by municipal or district au- !
thoiity. but the entire revenue derived from
the Etite nrhoo! fund and the revenue derived <
from tare* rnllectÂ»d for primary and tram- j
mar sohcw.lf Â«hal be applied exclusively to the :
support ofprimary and grammar *choolÂ«. The i
revenue derived from taxett collected for high !
school* and technical schools ehall \i* applied i
exclusively to the purport of such schools.
RernmmpriJatlons were made for a '
Board of Repents for the normal schools; I
for the organization of truant or parental
echools to enforce education; for the con- !
centr&tion and supervision of rural |
schools; for the encouragement of manual
training in the normal schools; also set
ting forth that the State text books are
rot satisfactory and suggesting the com
mission should find a way to solve the ex
isting difficulty.

NOT IN FAVOR
OF RACETRACK
GAMBLING ONLY
Supervisor Reed Forcibly
Objects to Helms'
Order.
Beplies Vigorously to a Significant
Remark of the Gamblers' Re
presentative That the* * v
Measure Will Pass.
. The Supervisors' Police Committee yes
terday was again unable to arrive at any
recommendation in regard to the half
dozen ordinances regulating, poolselling
within the city and county. Tobin was
not present at the meeting, and when
Helms aSked that his ' ordinance allowing
poolselling within the lnclosure of a race
track and prohibiting it everywhere else
be taken up Reed, the third member of
the committee, objected, as he said that
the subject had never" been discussed un
less the full committee was present.
Helms, backed by Frank McQuaide, who
represents the racetrack gamblers, sug
gested that the ordinances be presented
to the board without any recommendation
and Reed agreed with the plan, but de
clined to do anything in 'the absence of
Tobin.
At this juncture McQuaide asked that
the. ordinance relating to racetracks be
allowed to go to the board.
"We'll have. enough votes for it there,"
added McQuaide, significantly.
;To this Iteed replied that the Tobin or
dinance had been beaten by a vote of 10
to.S and that he held a contrary opinion
to that of McQuaide and that a much
larger vote would be recorded against the
ordinances now under consideration.
When McQuaide retired Reed expressed
himself forcibly regarding the assertion
made by McQuaide that enough votes
would be had to secure the passage of the
ordinance intended to legalize gambling
on racetracks only.
"Why does that man say that he has
enough votes on the ordinance?" said
Reed. "I do not believe what he says,
and such tactics on the part of the race
track men will not help their cause."
Reed, who was evidently angered at Mc-
Quaide's remark, then informed Helms
that further consideration would be post
poned. To this Helms replied that it
looked as though the ordinances would die
in the committee, to which possibility
Reed appeared to be perfectly reconciled.
The application of the National Athletic
Club to give a boxing exhibition on April
27 was granted on the managers agreeing
to abide by several rules formulated with
a view to Insure fsilr contests. These in
clude the appointing of one referee and two
judges for every contest and at the slight
est appearance of fraud all bets are to be
declared off.
Manager Crowley of the Columbia
Club asked for a permit for April
17, but was informed that the law
only allowed one professional boxing con
test in the month, and his application
would be refused. At this Crowley mut
tered that his club was not getting a
square deal, to which Reed replied an
grily: "Well, we are trying to secure
high class boxing and not too much of it,
and if the law is not complied with we
intend to put an end to all such exhibi
tions."
Butchers' Day.

"DIVE" WOMEN MUST
NOT DRINK AT BARS
In speaking of the saloons on the Bar
bary Coast Chief Sullivan 6aid yesterday:
"In future no women will be permitted
to stand at the bars or drink at the bars
in any saloon or 'dive' in the city. We
cannot prevent women from going into
private boxes in saloons or 'dives,' but if
any women are discovered at the bars
the forfeiture of the license will be the
penalty.- I have to-day sent word to all
saloonkeepers and divekeepers to that
effect, the regulation to come Into force
after Saturday night. There Is no ordi
nance prohibiting women from standing
at the bars, but it can be made a police
regulation. Any women found at the bars
will be arrested for vagrancy.
"Al White's license expires Saturday.
He has applied for a renewal and I was
detailed to investigate. I went there la&t
night and found fifteen women in front
of the bar, some of them drinking. I
at once notified him of the new order of
things and unless he complies his license
will not be renewed. His place is oils of
the worst in the 'tenderloin' and is on
a par with* Billy Abbott's, George Somer
set's and others."

FAILED TO BURY THE
BODY OF A DEAD NEGRO
Though Ordered to Do So, City Un
dertakers Turned It Over to a
Medical College.
The undertaking firm of Hagan Broth
ers, which has the contract for burying
the Indigent dead, is liable to get into se
rious difficulties with the Health Depart
ment. On April 7 last George Ramsey, a
negro, 24 years of age, died at the City
and County Hospital, and two days after
Hagan Brothers were notified by Superin
tendent Sussdorf to prepare Ramsey's
body for burial. Instead of carrying out
the order, the health officials say, the
body was turned over to the College of
Physicians and Surgeons for dissecting
purposes. '
As soon as the facts became known an
imperative order was issued to Hagan
Brothers by Health Officer O'Brien to re
cover the body and bury it forthwith.
Further action on the matter will be
taken at the next meeting of the board,
and the Hasans may be severely dealt
with.
Hereafter the resolution adopted by the
board that no unclaimed body shall be
sent to a college except on proper author
ity of the superintendents of county In
stitutions will be rigidly adhered to.

REPUBLICANS HOLD A
VERY TAME MEETING
A very tame meeting was held by the
Republican County Committee last even
ing. There was a large attendance, but
very little business to transact. The sec
retary was ordered to pay a number of
bills, and Chairman Bouvier appointed an
advisory committee. The appointees were
John Anern, Alpheus Duffee, P. V. Max
well, J. J. Morehouse and A. Ruef. The
latter gracefully declined the honor, be
lieving, he said, that certain members
would think he was trying to control the
deliberations of the County Committee.
Delegate Tilden tried to mollify the attor
ney by moving that, his declination be not
received, but at the earnest request of
Mr. Ruef the author of the motion with
drew it. The chairman then stated he
would announce Mr. Ruef's successor at
the next meeting. Tire resignation of J.

ing statements from individuals reflecting on
certain members of the California State Board
of Pharmacy, be it
Resolved. That the> president communicate
with his Excellency Governor Gage, asking
him to take the necessary steps for a complete
Investigation of the matter set forth In such
article and all matters relating thereto.
C. A. SIEFERT,
SAM L. WALLER.
The foregoing resolution was unani
mously adopted by the board sitting In
a body yesterday in its rooms at the Af
filiated Colleges. It was signed by the
two members who are alleged to have en
tered into a nefarious compact with a
mysterious person named "Dana," who Is
said to have come from Los Angeles.
An investigation was had by the board
into the charges of corruption. A num
ber of witnesses were examined, but noth
ing was elicited to show that a criminal
act had been committed by any member.
William R. Searby, president of the State
Board of Pharmacy and dean of the Oali
fornia College of Pharmacy, conducted tnd
examination. There were also present S.
Oberdeener of Santa Clara, E. Baer of
Bakersfleld, A. G. Orena of Ventura, C. A.
Siefert of Oakland and Samuel L. Wal
ler, secretary and treasurer of the board.
William E. Perry told of his dealings
with Dana; Dr. Houston of Santa Maria
said he knew Dana in Memphis by, the
name of Hart; L. E. Chapln, a Los An
geles printer, told how he had been
coached by the mysterious person; Al
Hoag, manager of the Grand Hotel phar
macy, told what he knew of the case, but
he threw no light on the identity of the
alleged go-between or implicated any of
the members with dishonest actions. A
young man named Pelton told how he had
paid Dana for coaching him and the ex
amination was concluded. .Attorney Strat
um arrived in time to help frame the reso
lution which is quoted, and which was
ordered sent at once to the chief execu
tive.
Secretary Waller made the following
statement at the close of the lnvestiga
tion;
The investigation was a complete refutation
and vindication. My. name was never men
tloned In any possible way. The personal Bpltf
of the president of the board is. I am satisfied
back of the whole affair. .He has fought
against me since I became secretary of the
board and has threatened to "do me." He has
tried to injure me heretofore, and I will yet
prove that he Is a party to the article which
appeared in the Examiner.
RUMORED CHANGE
IN RAILROAD'S
HIGH OFFICIALS
Southern Pacific Directors
Will Likely Meet Here
Two Members Necessary for a Quo
rum Said to Be on Their Way
Out From New York
City.
There is a feeling of unrest again In the
railroad building. . When the new board
of directors was elected last week It wa3
generally understood that Its first meet
ing would take place in New York and
that no changes were contemplated in
the personnel of the company's, officials.
Now comes the story, pretty well authen
ticated, that the board will meet here
within ten days and that there will be a
general shake-up in some of the offices.
The story is denied by Uuntington in a
general way. but the rumor is so persist
ent that there appears to be something
back of it.
There are only four of the eleven di
rectors in the city at the present time.
They are: C. P. Huntington. H. E. Hunt
ington, D. O. Mills and John W. Mackay.
It is stated on excellent authority that
two other members of the board are now
on their way Westward, and as soon as
they arrive the meeting will 'take place.
Just what the changes will be no one can
now say. There has been a story on the
street for some time that Secretary
Wright is to be superseded, but of course
this is denied.
President Huntington has been, ever
since his arrival in town, hard at work
looking over the several departments, and
he alone' probably knows what changes
are to be made. It is not improbable
that some of the proposed changes are to
be made to please new interests in thft
road.

LOS ANGELES. April 12.â As sufficient
time has elapsed since the warrant was
served on April 1 on Mrs. Amanda J.
Fiske-Marceau-Fennell that caused her
return from Bakersfleld with her little
son, Theodore Marceau Jr., whonvshe was
charged with kidnaping, a new feature
was to-day added to the case. In order
to bring this charge of felony. Instituted
by her former husband. Colonel Marceau,
to a definite conclusion, the attorneys for
Mrs. Marceau have decided to press the
matter for a hearing. Instead of waiting
until April 20, the case has been called for
to-morrow afternoon at 2 o'clock in the
court of Justice James. Senator White
and Attorney Pendleton say they will
force the issue and will clear the matter
of its present entanglements, so that if the
final merits of the points involved cannot
be determined here the groundwork will
be laid for the final struggle in Judge
Troutt's court, set for April 23, In San
Francisco.
Mrs. Marceau daily visits her boy at the
Westminster, through the stipulation en
tered into before Judge York. The meet
ings do not prove moments of pleasure to
the mother. . She shows many signs of
distress and that the ordeal ia taxing her
strength. The baby boy begs for his
mother to take him. He repeats his words
of love for her.
"I want to go with you," he said to-day,
"and live in your house, mamma, because
I love you. I want you to take me away,
as it is nicer where you are."
To-night Mrs. Marceau said that she
had been approached by parties whom she
believed represented Colonel Marceau in
the hope that a reconciliation might fol-

Commissioner found, as a fact, that the peti
tioner is In possession of a certificate of resi
dence issued to him by the proper officer, and
the Judgment of deportation Is based solely
upon the finding that such certificate was pro
cured to be issued by fraud and misrepresen
tation and by false testimony.
In my opinion the Commissioner was without
jurisdiction to find or adjudge that the issu
ance of the certificate referred to was procured
by fraud.
It is very clear that under this statute each
Collector of Internal Revenue was charged
with the duty of ascertaining and determining
whether the Chinese person applying to him
for the certificate of residence "provided for
was entitled thereto; and I am entirely satis
fied that In any collateral inquiry concerning
the right of its holder to remain in the United
States such certificate is conclusive evidence of
the facts recited therein. The certificate pro
vided for is the solemn act of the Government,
and is issued for the purpose ot furnishing
evidence of the right of the "holder to remain
in the United States, and the right which It
confers Is a valuable one. of which the holder
can only be deprived by the judgment of a
court of equity In a direct action brought by
the United States for the purpose of annulling
the certificate, or In a proceeding for deporta
tion, by proof that since its Issuance the
holder has forfeited his right to remain In the
United States by departing thererrom without
procuring from the Collector of Customs of the
district from which he departed a certificate
entitling him to re-enter the United States, In
accordance with article 2 of the treaty of
March 17. 1554. between the United States and
China, and the regulations adopted by the
Treasury Der-artment for the purpose of carry
ing out thÂ«> provisions of that article.
As the Commissioner did not have Jurisdic
tion in the proceeding before him to adjudge
that -petitioner's certificate was procured by
fraud, his finding In relation to such fraud,
and so much of the judgment as directs the
cancellation of the certificate, must be utterly
disregarded.
The Judgment of deportation In this case
must be held vo'd in the extreme sense because
It appears upon the face of the judgment that
the petitioner is in possession of an uncan
celed certificate of residence, which. In the ab
sence of a finding that he subsequently depart
ed from the country and thereby forfeited the
rlÃht conferred by such certificate, entitles
him to remain In the United States.
The Commissioner having found facts which,
under the law, show that petitioner has the
right to remain in the United States, the Judg
ment that he be deported is absolutely void,
as much co as would be a judgment of convic
tion upon a verdict of not guilty. r.- .'
The petitioner I? discharged.
SAT READING IN A
CHAIR AND EXPIRED
Sudden Death of a Colusa Man Who
Came to This City to Settle
an Estate.
JAMES L. SANDERSON, a sporting
man from Colusa, died suddenly yes
terday morning while Bitting In a chair
in a saloon at the corner of Eddy and
Leavenworth streets. Sanderson had en
tered the place about 7 o'clock in the
morning and was apparently in good
health. He ordered a drink from the bar
keeper, and after drinking sat in the chair
and read the morning paper. No attention
was paid to the man until about an hour
later, when he slid from the chair to the
floor. The barkeeper picked him up, and
noticing that the man was helpless sent
for a doctor, but before medical aid could
be had it was found that the man was
dead. i
Deceased had been in this city for about
two weeks. He came from Colusa to ad
minister upon en estate of a relative who
died recently and left a small piece of real
estate in San Francisco.
Sanderson was a native of England and
about 65 years old. The Coroner was no
tified and the body was removed to the

HIS LIFE BY.POISON
Frank L. T. Merwin Leaves a Mote
Saying No Woman Is Responsible
for His Death.
AT 11:30 o'clock "Wednesday night a
stranger engaged a room in the
lodging house at 317 Third street,
paying 25 cents for the night. At 9
o'clock 'yesterday morning he was found
dead in bed by Mrs. Lamber, the land
lady, who went to his room to awaken
him.
When Messenger Flanagan and Deputy
Coroner Brown searched the room they
found an empty pill box and the card of
A. J. Brannigan, druggist, corner Third
and Folsom streets. On the back of the
card, scribbled in pencil, was the follow
ing:
Â¦ For God's Bake don't blame a woman for
this ' scandal, for they are as blameless as the
King of Tlmbuctoo or the Kins of the Fiji Isl
ands. I picked this up on the floor of this
room. There is no other besides myself respon
sible.
Deputy Brown visited Brannigan's drug
store and was informed that a man an
swering the description of the deceased
had entered the store on the previous
evening and ordered a box of pills to be
made up for him, the ingredients being
nux vomlca, phosphorus and extract of
damiana.
The black derby hat of the deceased
was found on the floor and inside it were
several scraps of paper and a lead pencil.
Only the following was decipherable:
Bury me In the Potter's Field with the fools
that have gone before. I hope- the party that
is responsible for this will live long and pros
perous. You will probably have to get a China
man to translate this, as I am writing: It in

Queer. Report of the British
Cruiser Arethusa at
Victoria.
The General Opinion Is That Seal
Hunters Lost Their Lives in
the Wake of the Man-
Did the British cruiser Arethusa run
down a boat containing three men sent
on a hunting expedition from a sealing
schooner, or did she sight the remains of
three sailors drowned in the wreck of a
coaster? This was the one topic of con
versation on 'change yesterday.
A dispatch from Victoria, B. C, says:
"The Arethusa, arriving at Esquimau to
day, reports passing three bodies, evi
dently of male Europeans, floating just off
San Francisco on April 7. There was no
wreckage in the vicinity, although it is
presumed the corpses were from some
foundering sailing ship. There was a
heavy gale blowing and it was impossible
to Investigate."
The consensus of opinion was that the
man-of-war ran down a sealing boat and
sent the seal hunters to Davy Jones' lock
er without a thought of rescue. The old
timers reason in this way.
The men, according to the dispatches,
were in oilskins and long rubber boots.
The boots alone would be enough, when
filled with water, to take a body down and
anchor it forever. The fragments of a
boat run down by a big vessel would make
a certain showing on the crest of a wave,
while seal hunters would keep above
water long enough to enable the men- on
the afterdeck of the Arethusa to see and
describe the unfortunates.
The report from the Arethusa says that
the bodies were sighted about sundown
Saturday night. All of Saturday It blew a
gale and during Its continuance the pilot
boat Grade S carried away her mainmast
head and made port under difficulties. The
Lady Mine was hove to under short can
vas and Pilot Meyer was thrown out of
his berth and rolled across the cabin
again and again, finally bringing up
against the etcve. He is now going
around on crutches and it may be weeks
before he goes to sea again. Several small
boatsâ the Frolic, Bonita and Rover
started for Nome on Saturday but put
back on account of the gale and did not
leave again until Sunday. There is not
an overdue among the coasters, and not I
one of the fleet now out could have been
anywhere near Point Reyes on the 6th
inst.
Â¦m
FROM SEA
AND SHORE
Sealing schooners have constantly been
reported during the past fortnight on the
coast. All of them have made good
catches and all or nearly all have lost at
least a boat's erew â three men. One boat's
crew was landed at Eureka; another was
picked up by the steamer Crescent City
and landed at Crescent City, while a third
was picked up by the Noyo and brought
to San Francisco.
Judging from these facts the old timers
have come to the conclusion that the Are
thusa ran down a boat lost from a sealr
ing 'schooner and that the three sealers
lost their lives because the weather was
too heavy to launch a boat.
Sailing of the Alaska.
The bark Alaska was booked to sail for
Cape Nome to-day, but the passengers
urought a pull to bear and Captain Cogan
postponed the sailing hour until 10 a. m.
to-morrow. The 13th of the month and
Good Friday at that was too much for
â¢even the most hardened gold-hunter and
one and all backed down when it was an
nounced the bark would sail to-day.
Captain Cogan, who went whaling in the
Alaska last year, is in command of the
vessel, while Captain Green, formerly
master of the steam whaler Alexander,
chief officer and Captain. Lew Williams,
formerly master of the whaling brig Hl
ualgo, is a passenger. All three men will
put their knowledge of the arctic into a
common pool, and an attempt will be
made to reach the gold fields a month
ahead of all comers.
Those who will sail on the Alaska to
morrow are:
C. Champion. R. Champion, A. E. Bredull. J.
P. S. Johnson. Gustave Anderson. C. E. Wln

Captain Cogan has spared no expense
in putting the Alaska into first-class or
der for the passage, and if the passen
gers are not first at Cape Yorke, Golovln
Bay and Nome it will not be his fault or
those associated with him in the venture.
Irrawaddy Arrives at Last.
The steamer Irrawaddy, purchased by C.
D. Lane in the East for the Cape ' Nome
trade, reached port yesterday. She was
eighty days coming from Philadelphia,
and had to put into Bermuda with her
knlghtheads started and twelve feet ot
water In the forchold and three feet In
the second hold. Part of the cargo was
discharged and the vessel proceeded to
Coronel, where she was overhauled. The
passage from Coronel to San Francisco
was uneventful.
The Irrawaddy is a good stout ship of
2622 tons burden, and is In good condi
tion with the exception of her boilers,
which, require overhauling. She will dis
charge at Harrison-street wharf, and
will then be fitted out for the Nome
trade as speedily as possible.
Water Front Notes.
The Italian ship Emanuele Accame, 146
days from Hamburg; the British ship
Chiltonford, 116 days from London; tne
French bark Marthe Reux, 129 days
from London, and the British ship Bal
moral, 130 days from Antwerp, all made
port yesterday afternoon. The voyages
of all of them were uneventful.
The controlling Interest, flfteen-slxÂ«
teenths, in the barkentine Ruth was sola
to John Rosenfeld's Sons yesterday for
$7600. A hoodoo seems to hang over the
vessel, whlcÂ«* a change of ownership may
efface. She was formerly the bark
Sharpshooter, and was dismasted off tha
coast of Ceneral America while on her
way here with a cargo of nitrate. ThÂ«
hull was sold to American parties, who
changed her Into a barkentine. Since
that time she has never made a dollar for
her owners. x
Frank Huber, well known on the Stock*
ton steamers, was receiving the congratu

THE BRITISH CRUISER ARETHUSA IN SATURDAYS GALE
With this interrogation in regard to the
witness' moral sense and his reverence
for oaths the cross-examination ended for
the time and Simpton was again passed
back to the defense.
Redirect Examination Begun.
Garret McEnerney took the witness on
redirect examination.
"What record did you make of mar
riages when you married people In Sausa
lito?" began McEnerney;
"I never kept any, but I gave them a
certificate. They always brought their
license and on these were certificates
which I filled out and these I Hied with
the Recorder of the county and returned
them to the parties," said the witness.
The court adjourned until Monday, 11
a. m., in the midst of a long legal argu
ment between McEnerney and Charles
Pence.
turns green it Is useless. Should reduc
tion appear to stop add more of the ferri
cyanide solution, of course removing the
negative first from the bath and seeing
that the latter Is well mixed before the
negative is returned.
There are dozens of ways by which the
process of intensification can be per
formed, but for the average individual I
consider a one solution intenslfler the
best. It is a little more troublesome to
prepare, but It is exceedingly simple to
use, and, above all, one can see just what
is going on and can therefore tell when
density is sufficient. The following: are
the details of the process.
Prepare a saturated solution of bichlo
ride of mercury in waterâ that Is, dis
solve as much of the bichloride as the
water will take up. This can be done by
placing an ounce of the chemical In a
twelve or sixteen ounce bottle and filling
it with water. An occasional shake will
help solution, which proceeds very slowly.
The solution should be marked "poison."
Then dissolve one and one-quarter ounces
of iodide of potassium in six ounces of
water. The first solution should be poured
into the iodide a little at a time. A red
precipitate will at once form, which will
dissolve on shaking the bottle. A point
will be reached when the forming red
precipitate will no longer dissolve by
shaking, and when that happens no more
of the mercury must be poured in. Be
careful not to add more than will be
Just enough to make the solution very
slightly turbid. Now add one ounce of
hyposulphite of soda, and when this has
dissolved add enough water to the solu
tion to make the total bulk twenty ounces.
For use this should be diluted with about
three parts of water. If the ptate haa
not been thoroughly fixed the intensifying
solution will produce yellow stains. The
negative to be intensified should be soak
ed in clean water for about half an hour
and then Immersed in the intenslfler. It
will rapidly become denser, and the pro
gress can be watched by holding it up
and examining it with the sky for a back
ground. When dense enough the nega
tive should be washed and set aside to
dry. Should the intensification be over
done tt can be reduced by placing the
negative In the fixing bath for a short
time.
Another very excellent single solution
lntensifler is the platinum Inter.slfler,
which is manufactured by a Philadelphia
house. Full instructions accompany the
bottle, and the process is an exceedingly
simple one.
Local reduction and local Intensification"
may often be done with advantage. The
negative is placed in a horizontal posi
tion about a foot above a table, on which
is laid a sheet of white paper to reflect
the light upward. The solution Is applied
to the necessary spot by means of a small
brush. To prevent spreading it is thick
ened by the addition of a little ordinary
gum.
Local reduction may also be done by
taking a small piece of canton flannel op
cotton wool, dipping It in alcohol and rub
bing the spot gently. This abrades the
film and in point of fact is exactly similar
to sandpapering a piece of wood.
Among minor troubles may be Included
small transparent spots, which show very
distinctly on the prints as small black
specks. They are caused by particles of
dust on the film at the moment of expo
sure or by air bells on the film during 1
development. The remedy is to spot each
hole with opaque water color, applied
with the point of a fine brush or the point
of a toothpick chewed soft and brush
like.
The film sometimes feels rough after It

XL â IMPROVEMENT OF NEGA
TIVES.
BY f. DUNDAS TODD
What is a perfect negative? It Is exceed
ingly difficult to give a good definition,
but this may do as well as any. A nega
tive Is perfect when it gives the exact
kind of print the photographer wants.
Some men want all their pictures to be
clear, crisp and full of detail, no matter
what the state of the atmosphere at the
moment of exposure, while others en
deavor to get gray, smudgy effects under
exactly similar conditions. A perfect
negative In one man's hands would be a
failure In those of another.
But another point to be considered Is
the printing of the picture. Photographers
have much choice as to the printing me
dium, but unfortunately the same nega
tive will not give equally good prints with
all kinds of papers. Glossy papers tend to
give contrasting effects, therefore the neg
atives for such paper must Incline to flat
ness. Matt papers, all "gaslight" printing
papers, such as Velox, Dekko, Vlnco, etc.,
and platinotype papers, on the other hand,
require contrasty negatives, as they tend
to flatness. So during development we
must always keep the printing process in
mind if we hope to get a negative that
will approach perfection.
At this point It may be necessary to de
fine a few common terms so that there
may be no misunderstanding as to my
meaning. A "contrasty" or "vigorous"
negative is one where there Is a very de
cided deposit of silver on the high lights
or white objects and a very thin deposit
in the shadows. If the contrast be ex
cessive the print will show lack of detail
In the high lights when the shadows are
sufficiently printed, or If the high lights
are long in printing the shadow detail will
be lost by overprinting. A "flat" negative
is the very reverse of a "vigorous" one.
Such a negative will have a liberal deposit
of silver all over, the result being a flat,
insipid print. A "dense" negative Is one
that has a liberal deposit of silver, and
is easily known by the fact that it takes
a very long time to print. A "thin" nega
tive is the opposite and prints too quickly.
But we may have a combination of these
characteristics, and we must be able to
recognize them all in order to â¢ modify
them Judiciously. In short, we must rec
ognize the cause.
Underexposure will give contrast, but so
will overdevelopment. Overexposure tend 3
to flatness, but so does underdevelopment.
We may overdevelop an underexposed
plate and underdevelop ! an overexposed
plate and thus make matters worse. We
may have a very dense negative, that
takes a long time to print, and yet it may
give an excellent print because we partly
corrected overexposure by overdevelop
ment. But a dense negative that gives a
"contrasty" print indicates a correct ex
posure ruined by overdevelopment.
Suppose we take a batch of negatives
that are not giving satisfactory prints and
see if we cannot locate the trouble. It
might be wise to have a print beside us
for reference, as it will likely be a great
help. Our first negative gives us nice de
tail in the shadows, but the high lights on
the print are simply masses of white.
That is, the print is too "contrasty." Let
us now examine the negative by holding
it up to the sky or in front of a sheet of
white tissue paper, behind which is a
lamp or gas flame. Look carefully at the
high lights and see If there be detail pres
ent, and if so does it look as If it ought
to show in the print or is it lost In the
mass of deposit? If it seems as if it ought
to print and glossy paper has been used,
very likely a print on matt, plainotype or
a "gaslight" paper would be all that could
be desired. But if the detail be choked
up or a print on the papers Just mentioned
be unsatisfactory, then the contrast Is
due to overdevelopment and we must undo
part of that by the process known as "re
duction." This is described later on.
But the negative may be one that at no
stage shows detail in the shadows, yet
j one which takes a long time to print the
j high-light detail. An examination of the
I negative will show detail to be absent in
i the shadows. Here we have underexpos
ure combined with overdevelopment. The
only real remedy for this kind of negative
is a hammer, applied very indiscriminate
ly. Or the negative takes a long time to
I print, but the resulting picture is fair, or
I just a trifle contrasty. This indicates full
i oâ -Tc->i-f. or,^ "'â¢Â»rrt' i \v'opment. Reduction
will Improve this kind of negative won
derfully.
Or the negative may take a long time to
print, yet the pictures turn out flat and
lifeless. This is a case of gross overexpos
i ure combined with overdevelopment, a not
i uncommon complaint. Reduction will im
prove such a negative and In a very bad
case we may carry the process sufficiently
far to get rid of some of the shadow de
tail, and then recover contrast by inten
sifying what is left.
The negative may print quickly, giving
plenty of detail everywhere, and yet the
picture be flat. This indicates underdevel
opment and the remedy is intensification.
We may have overexposure combined with
underdevelopment and In this case It is
wise to get rid of some of the shadow de
tail by reduction before proceeding to in
tensify.
It is now time to describe how to con
duct the operations of reduction and In
tensification. They are even simpler than
development, so there Wno reason why
any amateur cannot handle them success
fully. .' : i :
Reduction is usually accomplished by
means of potassium ferricyanlde, com
monly called red prussiate of potash. Re
member, please, that it is a rank poison.
To use It take a crystal about double the
size of a pea and dissolve it in about two
ounces of cold water. Then make up an
ordinary hypo fixing bath and add to it
enough of the ferricyanide solution to
make it a slight straw color. Immerse the
negative, previously soaked in water for
about a quarter of an hour, In this, and It
will rapidly lose density. The progress
may be watched by holding the negative
occasionally against the sky or the white
tissue paper heretofore described. When
sufficiently reduced the negative should
be as thoroughly washed as after an or
dinary fixing bath. One' point needs spe
cial notice. Daylight decomposes a solu
tion of ferricyanlde very rapidly and
therefore the tray should not be placed In
front of a window. Whenever the solution

SIMPTON SHRUGS
HIS SHOULDERS
AT HIS PERFIDY
Not a Bold Witness on the
Stand, but a Very Cau
tious One.
i CroEs-Examination of I/afe Pence Is
, Concluded and the Sausalito
1 Recorder Is Passed Back
, . â¢ to McEnerney.
O. W. Bimpton, tho Sausalito Recorder,
formerly a Justice of the Peace, Is a
, very phlegmatic person. He was on the
I witness-stand in the Fair case yesterday
' morning and afternoon, and although he
Â¦ played the target for a steady fire of
\ cross-questions they fell off his armor of
r Indifference like water from a duck.
Â» Not that Simpton was impregnable on
\ his testimony. He was inconsistent and
i unsteady at times, giving ground when
i ever hard pressed, and continuously
; seeking an asylum in lapses of memory.
. On the whole Simpton's testimony was in
i keeping with that of Sylva, and he made
8 the third of George Knight's famous trio,
t of which the other two members are
i Dunand and Bylva, Much time was con
; sumed yesterday in the reading of news.
I paper clippings and forcing the witness
t to admit that he delved deep In the mine
I of falsehood. Simpton cared not a whit,
> confessing his perfidy and propensi
; ties for falsehood without a blush. Later
; on in the day Lafe Pence brought thf Al
mighty into the play and wanted ?Â»
, know from the witness if lie had any fear
I for "here or hereafter." Simpton sniffed
f at both with agnostic indifference.
Just prior to the conclusion of Pence's
; cross-examination It looked for a minute
as if another secret paper was to be ln
; trodueed into the evidence. When Simp
, ton went to Knight on the memorable
: Thursday night in February Sylva, the
. engineer, sat down and drafted a copy of
an affidavit, the original of the midnight
â¢ document. The Pence brotherhood want
! Ed this, but Sylva, who was present, de
â¢ clared that it was torn to tatters at the
j time.
i Confession of Perfidy.
On "Wednesday forenoon, February 14,
i where did you go after you left the court
; house? was the first Question asked the
witness by Lafe Pence.
"To your office," was the answer.
After some further and more detailed 1
cross-questioning Simpton admitted that
his answer was Incorrect and that he had i
left the court that day in company with :
Lafe Pence, both going to the Navarre,
the place of Simpton's confinement, for
the purpose of an interview with the re- !
porters. During this interview Simpton '
stated the full particulars of the alleged i
; wedding ceremony. At that time he deÂ«
i clared that he knew he had married the
j Senator and Mrs. Craven in July, IKK, but >
; was not sure of the exact date. As to the I
j secrecy of the marriage, Simpton ad- I
mitted that he said at the meeting: '
"Senator Fair wanted me to keep the fact \
iof the marriage from the world." The i
I full Interview, as reported in the papers !
lat the time, was read off in sections by '
Lafe Pence, who interrogated the witness j
on the truth and the facts of the state- !
ment.
Simpton's Confinement.
"Do you remember saying that until we
arranged for some bodyguard for you !
you would stay in the room?" ]
â¢Yes, Fir."
"And you stayed In the room all of
Thursday?"
"Yes, elr."
"And you didn't see Sylva from the Sun
day preceding to that time, or Joe Harvey
or Chief Lees?"
No, sir.
"And you didn't see me until 5 o'clock
that evening?"
"No. eir."
"And when I came Friday evening there !
were Charles Pence, two other men and i
Sylva in the crowd?"
"Yes, sir."
"After the Introduction of the two men,
I Messrs. McQuade and Caspar, did not I
I suggest that Sylva wanted to speak to you
alone?" .-.â¢Â¦ â¢ Â¦:
"Yes, sir, and we had a whispered con- j
j versatlon for some few minutes. When ;
I he finished he went out of the room. Sylva j
j returned later and Caspar wanted to i
know if I cared to go out. Sylva said that i
t he would take me to the fight pictures 'Â¦
J and that he would be bodyguard enough. !
! It was about 6:30 or 6:15 p. m. when Sylva !
; and I left and we went directly to
â¢ Knight's office."
"In the private conversation between I
you and Sylva did he tell you he had seen |
Mr. Knight and Joe Harvey?"
"Yes. sir."
"When you went to Knight's office was
any one else there but Knight and Sylva?"
"No, sir."
"Have you met the other attorneys of
the case?" (and Pence enumerated the full
list i. Tne 'answer of the witness was a
positive negative. He said he had not met
Lees, Curtin or any other party connected
with the case. :
"Were Knight and Sylva present when |
| the affidavit was drawn up?"
"Yes, sir."
"Had you been drinking before you went
to Knight's office?"
"No, sir."
"Who drew the affidavit?"
"Sylva did and Knight made a copy."
The latter is the paper referred to as the |
midnight affidavit.
Sylva Drafts Afiidavit.
Pence then called for the original which !
came from the hand of Sylva, and a re- I
cess was taken to telephone to Knight to j
produce it. Sylva was In the courtroom ;
and McEnerney asked him, "Have you i
the affidavit?"
"No; I tore it up In Knight's office that
night. It was only a draft."
A few moments before Sylva whispered
to McEnerney that Knight did not have
the paper, and that he (Sylva) had put it
in his pocket and carried it away, but im
mediately afterward Sylva claimed he did
not mean this. What he Intended to say
was that It was destroyed.
"Who wrote the first draft?" was the
next 6hot from Pence.
"Sylva, in presence of Knight and rhy- I
self, and then Sylva and Knight went j
into the other room and about fifteen mm- '
utes later came out with the affidavit, j
which I signed.".
81mpton was handed the affidavit, and
after reading it responded that no
changes had been made in it.
"Did not Knight say anything of this
kind to you, 'How is it you have sworn
to an affidavit and have given an inter
view to reporters stating that you had
married Senator Fair to Mrs. Craven?" "
"No, sir,", and when -pressed harder
Simpton weakly said: "I don't remember ]
his having said anything about it at all.
When he and Sylva returned from the
other room he asked me to read it over
and compare it with Sylva's original
draft, which I did, and found them the
same. We compared them, either Knight
or Sylva holding one, but my best im
pression is that It was Sylva.
A few more questions followed and the
affidavit was admitted as evidence and
labeled exhibit 21. .
No Fear of a Hereafter.
"Did not Knight say to you that 'Now
thajt this nefarious plot Is exposed you
ought to go to the District Attorney and
have this woman punished for perjury
and subornation or perjury?' " continued
Pence.
"No, sir; not aa far as Bylngton is con
cerned," was the response.
The witness was then interrogated
about his bodyguardsâ two of Curtln's
menâ who have been tacked to his person
ever since the eventful day. Simpton said
he had no idea who was to pay for tho
guards and that he merely tolerated them.
Lafe Pence asked McEnerney who paid
for them, but McEnerney refused to an
swer. Pence made a long speech to the
court, but worked no results. McEnerney
said at the wind up: "Not meaning to
be Impolite and insulting, I say, with all
due deference to the attorney, 'It's none
of your business. "
"Have you any compunctions of making
a false oath? Does it cause you any un
easiness of mind or loss of sleep?" began
Pence on the conscience talk.
"No, sir. Not under the circumstances,"
was the lightning answer.
"Have you any idea of pains and pen
alties after this life?"
"Oh, I don't bother about that."
"Have you any fear^of here or here
after 7"'
"Oh. yes; same as other Deonla hava."

New York Stock Market.
NEW TORK. April 12.â The fact that
to-day** adjournment of the Stock Ex
change was to be until next Monday and that
of the London Exchange until next Tuesday
prompted the closing up of epeculatlve. con
tract* to-day. Profeeslonal traders are averse
to keeping open contract* for so long a period
at any time, and at this time especially they
have ln mind the varying ztosslbllities of the
war in South Africa, the war ln the euear
trade, the showing to be made by the weekly
bank statement on Saturday and the possibility
of rold export* by Saturday** steamers. As
realizing has been going on to a large extent
this week most of the uncovered contracts were
on tine short side and the demand to cover
was an important factor ln rallying price*. In
addition the pools which exist ln a number of
stocks adopted aggressive tactics for an ad
vance, taking advantage of the disinclination
of the bears to extend their commitments on
the eve of the holiday. After the demand from
the ehorts had been eatirfied the pÂ«ol manipu
lators began to find themselves alone in the
bldd'.ng for stocks, with a steadily augmenting
burden cf realizing rale* as prices reached the
higher level. The procesÂ« of bidding up prices
was therefore discontinued and the market
lapsed Into comparative dullness and sluggish
ness. The Industrials moved quite Independ
ently of the general market and none of them
occupied a very conspicuous place In the trad-
Ing. The most notable movement of the day
was that in Missouri Pacific, which on buying
Fllcged to be for manipulative purposes was
carried up nearly four points and closed at the
top. This had a sympathetic effect on the
other member* of the Southwestern group.
Union Pacific was xerr heavily absorbed and
was carried up to 69. the other transcontinental
lines. Including the Atchison*, responding ln
6vrrpÂ«thy.
The Baltimore and Ohio *toclw and the Nor
fork and Western stocks rose conspicuously,
ttie lorrztr an very Urge dealings and with
well-sustained strength. The granger* were
comparatively quiet. With the exception of
Baltimore and Ohio and Missouri Pacific gains
were not well maintained and the closing was
decidedly unsteady and below the best. The
industrials as a rule were heavy. Sugar, Peo
ple's Gas. FWeral Steel, the Steel and Wire
stocks and other stock* of the steel group
showing acute weakness -at different times.
Third Avenue showed the effect of disappoint
ment over the term* of the lease to Metro
politan. General Electric was an exception
and enjoyed a net gain of 3%. In spite of an
easing of the London money rate continuous
buying of stocks for London account and the
unprecedented balances ln this country's fa
vor, as disclosed by the March foreign trade
statement, sterling exchange moved up an ad
ditional fraction to-day and all of the usual
authorities are at a loss to explain the
movement. A favorable bank statement is con
sidered assured owing to the large gains ln
the sub-treasury, but ease ln the local money
market will facilitate gold exports. There was
moderate -activity and strength ln the bond
market. Total sales, par . value, $2,205,000.
United States ?a registered declined % In the
bid price. Prices of stocks have moved down
ward during the week, with the exception of a
few stocks affected by special features of
strength or which were manipulated to sustain
the general list for purposes of realizing. There
has been some liquidation, due in part to
the demand from bears to cover short contracts.
The market has been almost entirely ln the
hands of professional operators during the four
days on which business was done and prices
are not an Index to public sentiment regard
ing the business outlook. These stocks were
cold because the considerable advance ln prices
offered attractive profits to early buyers and
the question arose whether the rise had not
fairly discounted the prosperous conditions.
The character of some of the selling revealed
a conviction on the part of those with good
means of Information of the desirability or
realizing. The admission of Pennsylvania of
ficials that advantage had been taken of the
existing high level of prices to market some
of the stock ln the company's treasury was
accepted as a clear intimation that the price
of the stock had gone as high as was war
ranted. When speculative operators in other
stocks sought to take their profits they dis
covered that the semi-investment demand.
based on the dividend return offered by stocks,
had largely ceased at the high level attained
by some.
The jirofesEional bear traders are always on
the alert for such a ! condition of affairs, and
they have been prompt to take advantage of it
this week by selling stocks short and taking
the market away from those seeking to realize.
As conditions of business continue favorable. It
is fair to assume that the decline ln prices will
be arrested before the late advance has been
entirely wiped out. Already bear traders find
offeringe decreasing, ln volume on a decline, and
commission houses made bids for stocks at a
level below the market. The presence of an
aggressive bear element ln the market and the
reactionary tendency shown has prompted thoee
seeking to secure stocks to withdraw their buy
ing orders in the hope of getting ln at a lower
level of prices. The movement of 1 prices ln
come cases indicates that the bear aggression
is to afford opportunity for securing stocks at
lower prices ln greater volume than ia neces
sary for the mere covering of short contracts.
While these symptoms indicate that the limits
of the reaction are not far off, there is nothing
to Indicate whether a general advance will be
renewed. Speculative opinion evidently hesi
tates and waits for further developments to
point the way for a further movement. Great
uncertainty is felt regarding the future of the
money market. Last week's disappointing bank
statement has had a continuing influence, and
the mystery of the small increase ln cash re
serves in view of the heavy accretions by rea
con of cub-treasury operations remains unex
plained. The continued outgo of funds from
the sub-treasury to the market has, for this
reason, failed to have much influence on senti
ment.
Although rates for money this week have
continued low. Indicating easy conditions, there
has nevertheless been come calling of loans and
consequent shifting, which of necessity causes
ecrne disturbance ln the stock market. The
continued rise in sterling exchange toward the
gold export point has disturbed sentiment, aa
fears are enteitained that an outward move
mer.t of gold would stiffen the money. rate here.
As a matter of fact, a small shipment of gold
was made to Buenos Ayres on Tuesday, which
was for London's benefit and which ln effect
represented a control by London of the Inter
national exchange. This movement of sterling
exchanges has detracted from the effect of the
much-paraded London buying of American se
curities. Much mystery surrounds this move
ment. In New York it is attributed to foreign
er* who carry their holdings with money bor
rowed in New York. In London It Is attributed
to Americans who borrow money in London to
carry their holdings. Only very light shipment*
of securities from New. York to London can be
traced through the usual channels. It is re
ported, on the other hand, that the high-priced
American railroad stocks have been coming
home In larger volume.
There has been some demand for exchange to
pay the Installment due last Monday on the
British war loan by American subscribers, but
the amount called for is not sufficient to ac
count for the strength of sterling. This strength
Is the more remarkable, considering the foreign
trade balance, which has -again reached unpre
cedented figures for March. . according to the
results foreshadowed by the Government's pre
liminary figures.
This and last week's shrinkage ln the banks'
surplus reserve* has not availed to check the
upward movement of exchange. Uneasiness over
this development- has been a potent factor ln
causing hesitation In the stock market.
Business ln bonds ha* been on a diminishing
scale, but prices have been better sustained
than ln stocks.

which closed firm at the top. Union Pacific
and Louisville and Baltimore and Ohio were
favorites. Copper shares were good, Tlntos

gold to South Africa and bought Â£39,000 ln

Chicago Grain Market.
- CHICAGO, April 12.â May wheat opened ,%e
under yesterday at 6614@66%c, depressed by the
Increased Argentine shipments, lower cables
and favorable weather, as well as the heavy
selling of yesterday. Shortly after the opening
May touched 67c, but from that on the course
of the market was downward with a few ana
feeble interruptions. The market was fairly
steady up to noon, when the bears began ham
mering and as the stop-loss wheat came out
touched 66Uc I Early there was a fair demand
in the pit. but later the situation was reversed.
Duluth reported some export business and re
ported a likelihood of foreigners partaking of
our liberal store, but the report failed to affect
the locals. May closed weak, %@%c under yes
terday, at 66>/4c. Â¦
The selling of corn to-day was mainly in
small lots. A decline, which was started by
lower cables, wheat weakness and favorable
crop outlook, brought out a deal of stop-loss
orders. The price descended on lack of demand.
There was an early bulge which carried May up
%c. caused by open buying by recent liquidating
longs, but the gain was lost. May closed weak,
%@lc lower. -
Oats were weak and were generally neglected.
May closed UÂ®%c down.
The provisions market was generally active
and strong, though May Pork early snowed a
zigzagging â¢ tendency. Hogs were lower 'at the

especially good demand for lard. May lard

Dried Fruit in New ' York.
The New York Commercial says: "The ag
gregate sales cf prunes for the week have been
a number of cars, though most of them have
gone out in 100 to 200-box lots. One sale 'â¢was
two cars to one person, either for himself or
to distribute among associated dealers. Prices
are unchanged, but the feeling is not strong.
Some holders would let their stock* go at less
than quotations if they could get rid of them,
and this too. in face of the statements that
total suppllos in first hands are unusually
small for the season.
â¢Raisins are showing evidence of better feel
ing and dealers are holding them firmer than
they have done heretofore. The reason '.* not
easy to find, but is no doubt partly due to the
partial settlement of the friction between the
growers and the association. It has been
definitely determined that the association shall
park its own raisins this year, and that has
had a steadying effect on the market. Prices
have not advanced, nor have sales increased
materially, but the better feeling is Indicative
of possibly a cessation of the low prices and
weak demand which have characterized trade
for the past few weeks.
"Peaches are unchanged, though there have
been large sales this week. A number of cars
were sold at one time, which Is said to have
closely cleaned up the spot supply of some
grades. Consequently there is a firmer feeling
and holders are disposed to ask more for their
goods."

STREET COMMITTEE
POSTPONES ACTION
Railroad Representatives Ask for
Time to Prepare Answer to a
New Ordinance.
At the request of Jere T. Burke,
political manipulator of the South
ern Pacific Company, and William
Clayton of the San Francisco and
San Mateo Electric Railway Company,
the Street Committee of the Board of Su
pervisors yesterday postponed action on
the ordinance introduced by Supervisor
Magulre regulating streetcar fare for two
weeks. The ordinance was published in
full in The Call of Tuesday last and has
for its object the reduction of fares to
passengers who are unable to find seats
and compelling railroad companies to stop
their cars whenever hailed by a passen
ger. When the matter came up for action
both railroad representatives joined in the
request for a postponement. They said
they had many objections to offer and
would like to be heard before it was re
ported back to the board, but, owing to
the shortness of the notice, had not been
able to prepare a reply. Supervisor Ma
guire, chairman of the Street Committee,
assured both gentlemen that the ordinance
was a very serious matter and that it
could be adjusted satisfactorily so as to
please all parties. He also said it was
not the desire of the committee to rush
the matter through or to do anything ob-
Jectional. He therefore acceded to the
request for a postponement and Super
visors Connor and Curtis, who are also
members of the committee, joined him.
The committee decided to report favor
ably on the request of the Board of Pub
lic Works that the sewers in Chinatown
be flushed and that an unused cistern at
the corner of Clay and Taylor be used for
that purpose if the consent of fhe Fire
Commissioners could be obtained. The
Board of Works was also directed to co
operate with the Health Department in
the use of disinfectants. It was unani
mously agreed to recommend to the board
that $1000 be allowed the Health Depart
ment for the opening of nine blind sewers
in Chinatown.
Consideration on the application of the
Bay and Coast Railway Company for a

Inquest Fails to Develop Evidence
Whether the Injury Was Received
Before or After Falling
Into the Water.
BERKELEY. April 12.â The Inquest on
F.W. Kreling. whose body was found
April 1 on the Berkeley shore, was held
this afternoon by Coroner Mehrmann.
Several witnesses who were not present at
the preliminary' examination last Monday
testified to-day.
Dr. Rowell, who made the autopsy, was
the flrpt witness called. He gave the re
sult of his examination, and stated that
all the organs were found in normal con
dition, and that there was nothing which
would confirm any suspicions of drown
ing. When asked If the embalming fluid
which had been injected into the body
would destroy any signs which would
help to give a correct analysis, he replied
that it would not.
"It Is my opinion." said he. "that Krel
tag came to hi? death from a shock
i caused by a blow on the upper anterior
portion of the chest. The blow would
stop the action of the heart or burst an
artery or blood vessel." Â¦ Â» :
Mrs. John Kreling testified that she had
Iftst sÂ»en her father-in-law at 1 o'clock
Friday afternoon, March 30. She did not
i enter his room until the next morning,
when Fhe found the bed disturbed. Krel
ing might have slept during the. after
noon.
Antone Pfelffer said he had known
Kreling for the past twenty years, al
thouÃh he had not 6een him very much
1 during two or three years.
! "I met Kreling on the steamer Daunt
less Friday evening," said he, "March 30,
at 6 o'clÂ»ck. He eaid he was going to
Stockton for a few days. He contem
plated a trip East to sell some property.
"I was in conversation with him during
the entire trip. He felt very melancholy
because of losing so much property. He
felt blue about the loss of his furniture
factory and the Tlvoll, and seemed to
think every one was trying to rob him in
his old days. Mr. Kreling felt particu
larly blue when we reached Vallejo, where
one of his sons hud died. He did not say
anything of suicide, but was very much
depressed. ' *
"I left him at Antioch. He was asleep
In a chair and did not, to my knowledge,
ge^ off the steamer."
Solomon Kampe said he had known
Kreling for many years, but had not seen
him recently, until three days before his
disappearance.
"I was standing in front of the Colum
bia building when Kreling entered the
door. I tÂ«?wed to him, but got no re
sponse. He merely shook his head and
walked on. I am positive that he saw me,
but was evidently preoccupied."
Detective C. J. Cody said he had taken
the steamer Dauntless to Antioch. He
had interviewed Marshal Sweeney, who
saw a man answering to the description
published In the papers of Kreling. Swee
ney saw him go to the door of Danken's
saloon and look In, but did not enter.
Danken was shown the bottle of whisky,
but did not remember selling any thai
evening to any one. He believed the bot
tle was not his.
Undertaker" H. B. Brown testified to
having found the bones of the right wrist
broken. This he discovered when dress-
Ing the body.
The jury rendered the following ver
dict:
"That death was caused by shock re
sulting from a blow upon the upper an
terior portion of the chest received by the
deceased from some source unknown to
the Jury." -:-â¢---

SPOKE OF REAL PRESENCE
IN BLESSED SACRAMENT
Father Yorke Tells of the Close
Union Resulting Between God
and Man in That Cere
mony.
The subject of Rev. Father Peter
Yorke's sermon at St, Peter's Church last
r.ight was the "Real Presence of Jesus
Christ in the Blessed Sacrament." The
reverend lecturer said that God manifest
ed himself through the sacrament of the
Holy Eucharist, whereby a closer union
resulted between him and man.
"The prophecy contained In the Old
Testament has had Its glorious fulfill
ment In the new." said Father Yorke. "and
God dwells more really with the people
than when he came among the Israelites.
In those ancient times God was with the
Jews in their temples. The sufferings and
death of hi* son Jesus has made it possi
ble for him to abide with Individuals
through the grace of the Blessed Sacra
ment instituted 1Â»j years ago, on the day
before he went to his death, when he and
his disciples sat at the last supper.
"It is tru/* that the Jews were the chosen
people of TJod, which fact wa* evidenced
in many ways, and though they would not
receive' his divine son. he was none the
Ipfs God among men. In the Blessed Sac
rament there is a union of the real pres
ence of God and man closer than that
which exists between the vine and Its
branches."
Father Yorke concluded his discourse by
exhorting his hearers not to fail to per
form their Easter duties on next Sunday
end thereby chow their love and devotion
to one who had died to save them from
their sins.

JOHN C. WILSON THROWN
FROM A RUNAWAY HORSE
Park Accident That Might Have Been
Avoided Were Mounted Police
on Hand.
The action of the Police Department in
removing the* old-time mounted police
from Golden Gate Park is beginning to
show its evil effect. Ap accident occurred
yesterday afternon to John C. Wilson,
president of the firm of John C. Wilson &
Co., dealers in coal at 900 Battery street,
which might have resulted fatally and
shows to what danger the habitues of the
park are subjected since the new rule has
gone into effect.
Mr. WilÃon was thrown from a runaway
horse at the big water tank on the main
driveway and received some painful
braises and a severe shock. Shortly after
entering the park the horse took fright,
and getting the bit in his teeth was soon
beyond the control of the rider. There
was no mounted policeman In eight to
stop the mad career of the animal, but
Wilson clung on tenaciously urÂ»il the
water tank was reached, when he was
thrown violently to the ground.
The horse then turned around and
dashed down the main drive. Captain
Thomson, one of the few who are still
mounted, bue on a horse that now needs
prodding, gave pursuit, but the site of the
old '49 camp was reached before~the run
away was brought to a stop.
Wilson was attended by his valet, but
the latter was left far in the rear when
the horse began his mad career.
ANOTHER TEN DAYS
FOR CAPTAIN DEMING
Time Allowed for Preparation â Sta
tions Assigned to Home
Battalions.
The court-martial for Captain Peter C.
Deming proceeded again yesterday, but
It got no further than another allowance
of time, for the defense was not ready,
and the court adjourned until Monday,
the 23d, when it will try again. -""..-'
When the court opened Ijt was found
that the accused had procured the ser
vices of Crittenden Thornton, and It was
he who opened proceedings with a re*
quest for delay. He said he had not yet
arranged his business w>'as to allow him
to attend the court-martial, and in addi
tion he had not been able to look into the
accounts which it Is charged are short.
He said It would save time in the end
if he could be allowed to dig through the
accounts of the accused and get familiar
with them. Instead of having to tak*
them as they came up in the,; trial. The
charge regarding - shortage had been
raised something over $400, .and the de
fense had already sent "East" for papers
which would throw some light upon It,
and for these, too. the defense wished to
wait. It was finally agreed to allow the
time asked, and the court adjourned to
the time set. Mr. Thornton asked that
the accused be allowed to move over
from Alcatraz, but this matter was left
to the u.scretion of General Shafter.
The disposition of the three home
battalions from the Philippines, those
from the â¢ Fourteenth. Eighteenth ana
Twenty-third Infantry Regiments, has
been settled in Washington orders, and
In the same order is the paragraph trans
ferring the Third' Artillery headquarters
from Angel Island to the Presidio. The
battalion from the Twenty-third will take
station at Fort Douglass. Utah, and Lieu
tenant Colonel Eskridgc. now in com
mand of the Presidio, will more than
probably go with it. The department or
der transferring Coldnel Rawles of the
Third to the command of the Presidio will
be issued to-day or to-morrow. The trans
fer will take place May 1. The home bat
talion of the Fourteenth will be assigned
to Fort Wayne, and that of the Eight
eenth will go to Fort Keogh, Mont.
Another prisoner escaped from the
guard at the Presidio Wednesday. He
broke from the bunch while they wers
passing a bit of thick timber, and al
though the guards fired several shots at
him he made good his escape.

Dr. Keeney is no longer a member of
the Police Department. Rather than neg
lect his practice and don the uniform of
a sergeant of police in conformity with
the wish of the present Board of Police
Commissioners, Keeney yesterday morn
ing handed In his resignation to Chief Sul
livan to take effect immediately.
Keeney was appointed sergeant of po
lice by the old board of commissioners,
his duties being to look after the sick
and injured members of the department.
Ail went well until a short time ago whea
Chief Sullivan, in looking over the list
of the "folnest." came across Keeney's
name. Calling in his clerk he asked him
if the urbane doctor had ever done police
duty. The clerk explained that Keeney
was pupposed to prescribe for the Bick
members of the force, for which he was
allowed $125 a montn. Without asking
any further questions the Chief forthwith
dictated? a note to the policeman-physician
ordering him to appear for dut>- or suffer
the humiliation of being dropped froru
the roil. After thinking the matter over
Keeney decided not to make a fight to
retain his soft berth and yesterday he
ft s-c-nt in his resignation, together with his
*Fiar. Both will no doubt be accepted at
the next meeting of the Police Commis
sioners.

MARION WWELLS LOSES
HIS BEAUTIFUL HOME
LITTLE TO SEE
AT THE PARIS
EXPOSITION
Only One Group of Buildings
Ready for the Open
ing Day.
Several Thousand Soldiers Put : to
Work Clearing Away thÂ» Piles
of Accumulated Rubbish
on the Grounds.
Copyrighted, 1900, by the Associated Press.
PARIS, April 12.â 1t is now clear beyond
doubt that the Exposition is much behind
that of 18S9 at the date of the latter's
opening. It is estimated by competent au
thorities that all will be in order before
the first week in June, and for the time
being all that 13 ready for public Inspec
tion is the magnificent group of buildings
running from the Champs Elysees to the
Invaiides and some of the palaces in the
main exhibition on -the Champs de Mars
and Rue dcs Nations, where the pavilions
of various foreign countries are placed.
Most of the sideshows due to private
enterprises, such as the Vieux Paris,
Topsy-Turvy Housfe, Mareorama of the
Compagnle Transatlanttque, the Swiss
village and big wheel, are either com
pleted or on the point of being so. The
exposition grounds from the Champs Ely
sees to the Champs de Mars to-aay are
as busy as a beehive.
The principal efforts of M. Alfred
Picard, commissary general, are being de
voted to preparing the Gallerie dea Ma
chines and Esplanade dcs Invaiides for
the visit of the President on Saturday.
In order to aid in the work several thou
sand soldiers were to-day brought to the
grounds and under orders of officers of
engineers aided In the work of clearing
away piles of rubbish accumulated there
and began the construction of roadways
and the laying down of gravel.
As after to-day's date no exhibits will
be allowed to enter the exhibition until
the -18th -of the month from the earliest
hours of the. morning thousands of carts
and wagons piled with boxes and cases
besieged every entrance to the various
sections. The mass of vehicles was at
times so great as to bring 'traffic in the
streets around the exhibition grounds to
a standstill. .
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL., FRIDAY, APRIL. 13, 1900.
TAKES POISON
AT MIDNIGHT
IN THE PARK
Beautiful Young Woman
Attempts to Commit
Suicide.
Swallows Carbolic Acid and Lysol
and Is Found Lying on the
Ground â Her Name Is
Helen Gray.
A beautiful younp woman, richly dress
ed, attempted to end h*r life In Golden
Gate Park last nlpht by swallowing a
double dose of poison. About midnight
IÂ»ark Policeman Dearborn, while makinj?
his rounds through the park, was Ftartled
bjr a woman's scream. He Immediately
proceeded to Investigate, but as the
scream was? not repeated and the dark
ness was Ir.tense he searched for fifteen
minutes* without discovering the cause of
h!s alarm. Finally, near the Battle Cross.
fact oit the main drive, he came across
the body of a young woman writhing in
agony on the ground.
She was semi-conscious and It needed
but a rlanee to show that she had taken
poison. A rose protrudea from her mouth
which, when withdrawn, showed that the
clem. se%-eral Inches in length, had been
forced down her throat. The officer hur
ried the woman to an ambulance and sent
her to the Receiving Hospital, where It
was found that she had taken "a dose of
lysol and another of carbolic acid.
When she recovered conpeioufnes* ehe
refused to disclose her identity and all
she would say was:
"No one cares for me now; I want to
dip."
She was richly dressed and beautiful in
face and figure. She is apparently about
1& years old. probably another victim of
disappointed love.
The girl finally, after a great deal of
urging.said her name wasHelenGray, and
that she recently came to San Francisco
from her home in Oregon. The police and
surgeons at the Receiving Hospital, how
ever, believe ene gave a fictitious name,
the better to hide her Identity. She will
recover.

VALLEJO, April 12.â At a conference
held between F. W. Kelley. secretary of
the Pacific Coast Trottlng-horse Breeders*
Association and Vallejo members of
the board of directors of Solano
Agricultural District - No. 36 It was
proposed by Secretary Kelley that If
Vallejo racing men will guarantee the
breeders' association a bonus of 51000
they will hold their annual race meet
ing In Vallejo. It will be the opening of
a big: State circuit and 13 the most Im
portant event in racing 1 circles. The as
sociation will bring here about 4>io horses,
with their owners and trainers. This
event is usually held in San Francisco or
Oakland. Mr. Kelley suggested that the So
lano County fair directors hold their dis
trict fair at the same time, the date to
be the first week m July. It was decided
to" call a meetine of the directors of Dis
trict No. 36 to be held at 1:30 o'clock on
Saturday next in this city, when the prop
osition will be fully discussed and decisive
action taken.
1O*Â»2. THIRD RACE â Six furlongs: handicap; three-year-olds and upward; purse. *XXX
SARDINE, AMONG
OTHER CHOICES,
FAILED TO LAND
A Small But Sympathetic
Crowd Tried to Look
Happy.
Bookmakers Grab About All the Coin
in Sight â Curves and Inshoots
Too Puzzling to
Solve.
The racing at Ta.nforan.Park has degen
erated into a state of affairs which is
nothing more than a hollow mockery of
sports. Favorites are bowled with
alarming regularity, to the apparent gain
of somebody, and the handful of mis
guided players still dallying with the game
is ageing fast and growing threadbare.'
After Homage had captured the intro
ductory event yesterday the remaining
five choices were buried under an ava
lanche.
A six-furlong handicap furnished one of
the most delicious surprises of the after
noon. Sardine, with 101 pounds up, looked
a "moral," and after leading to the pad
dock fell soft game for Willie Sink's
Formero. The winner was once 10 to lin
the ring. Cormorant ran third.
Homage, the shifty Take Notice filly,
from the Burns & Waterhouse stable,
made It three straight in the two-year
old scramble. Backed to 8 to 5 favorit
ism, she won galloping from Ada N, a 20
to 1 ehot. Bavassa, though tiring badly,
managed to take the show.
Corrigan's St. Casimir again showed the
"yellow dog" in his makeup. After reced
ing in the betting on the six-furlong sell
ing run from 6 to 6 to 8 to 5, he led to the
paddock and was then downed by High
Hoe. J. Ranch on Mortgage put up a
miserable ride, finally stumbling Into the
show.
The mile and a quarter selling run went
to the S2-pounder, My Gypsy. With J.
Ranch up she sailed out In the lead under
wraps, finishing the easiest sort of a win
ner in 2:14. Sardonic, the first choice,
earned the place from Prestome just as
handily.
So quickly did the price against Silver
Tone go from 2 to 5 in the speculating on
the fifth recital that the horse was sup
posed to be "dead." Quite the reverse,
Morgan took him out in front and after
a quarter had been covered was never
headed. Captive was beaten foÂ» the place
by Castake.
Even Bathos, a 1 to 4 chance, went
down the sliding board in the last. Why
he did not win is a mystery. A few wise
ones banked on Maydine, which was
backed from 5 to 3, and the Shulte entry
won in a walk from Urchin, a 75 to 1 shot.
Bathos ran third.
Track Notes.
Charles N. Roberts, secretary of the
Overland Park Association of Denver, is
here on business pertaining to the coming
race meet in that city in June.
Tappan changed hands yesterday. He
was entered in the fourth race to be sold
for $300. and was claimed by "Billy Ma
grane, owner of Prestome.

AGUINALDO SAFE
IF SECRETED IN
MANILA'S WALLS
Authorities Not Anxious to
Capture- and Make a
Martyr of Him."
Lieutenant Knox, Ex-Assistant Chief
of Police at Manila, Thinks In
- surgent Leader's Own Peo- *.
: pie Will Kill Him.
./'I scarcely doubt. the. truth of the cur- :
rent'rumors that Aguinaldo is concealed
In Manila. If he were I do not think that
the authorities would .make much effort
to ; catch him. To capture and Imprison
the Insurgent chief would be to make a
martyr of him, and the effect on the na
tives would be bad. If he Is let-alone the
Macabebes will assassinate . him, for
thejvhave'no love- for ; him." .Â¦"
This remarkable statement was , made
at the Grand -Hotel yesterday afternoon
by Â¦ First Lieutenant B. B. Â¦; Knox. a
nephew of Colonel. Knox. the famous New
York, hatter.- Lieutenant Knox has- just
returned from Manila, where he was for
over seven months Chief of .Police of the
Quiapo district. He was also Assistant
Chief of , Police of Manila . under . Major
Tiernon of the Sixth Artillery. Lieutenant
Knox now belongs to the , Seventh Infan
try, a"nd is on his way! to .New . Mexico,
where he has been ordered for garrison
duty. His first command, however, was
In. the Twentieth Infantry in Cuba. \ His
military, training was in the famous New
York Seventh Volunteersâ the "kid-gloved
regiment.". After the trouble was over
in Cuba the Twentieth was ordered- to the
Philippines, and has now been thereabout
eighteen months.
Lieutenant Knox tells some Interesting
things about the policing of Manila,. with
its 350,000 inhabitants. .. The city .is divided
into seven districts and each has a' Chief
of Police, who makes daily reports to Ma
jor Tiernon. About 1500' soldiers are em
ployed in, policing the city, and in addl-'
tlon to these 140 native police. .The em
ployment of native police has been a great
aid to Major- Tiernon in the suppression
of 'crime. The white police - never suc
ceeded in securing the -confidence of the
Filipinos, so they were never, certain .of
what was going on.
It was during the time that small bands
of insurrectionists were ' springing up all
over tho city last October and arms being
collected .under the nose.s of the official*
that the natives were employed. They
promptly brought the conspirators to
light and enabled the military authorities
to make many important seizures. In
fact, they have put an end to all con
spiracies in Manila.. *

840 Market St., Opp. 4th
evening was In no small part due to the
fact that a Callfornian had been appoint
ed a membfer of the commission. The pro
found learning and clear Judgment of that
member was a joy to the commission and
the people were to be congratulated on
the selection of Bernard Moses. Another
reason for the enthusiasm was the knowl
edge that Sanj Francisco was to be the
gateway for. tne great commerce of the
Orient. The Commissioners knew that if
they could establish the government that
would be of the greatest stability consist
ent with honor and safety, they would be
doing that which would be of the greatest
commercial advantage to the United
States. He would have much preferred,
he said, that the country would not have
had to confront the present conditions.
He was not an expansionist. But our ob
ligations to the nations of the world and
to the people of the Islands would not
permit us to allow misguided people to
bring about chaos, and those obligations
caused the people to act. The duty of the
hour was to give the Filipinos the best
government possible; to do something, and
not to rely wholly upon proclamations.
It would be difficult, in view of the
breaches of faith on the part of the Span
ish with which the Filipinos had long been
familiar, to accomplish much at first. It
would seem to be almost impossible if it
were not for the capacity of the Amer
ican people.
Politics Will Not Figure.
There would be no consideration of poli
tics In the administrative acts of the
Commissioners, said the sneaker. As
many servants among the Filipinos would
be selected as possible to assist in the
work of the commission, and they would
be chosen on the general principle of civil
service. So also would It be with the em-

"Warehousemen Sued by Assessor.
A suit was brought yesterday in the
Justices' Court by Assessor Dodge 'in the
name'of the people against A. B.'Caldwell,
proprietor of the Pioneer Warehouse, for
damages in the sum 0f. 5200. The suit has
been brought to test the right of the As
sessor to compel the owner of a ware
house to testify regarding the value of
the goods In his charge belonging to other
persons. Caldwell' was subpenaed by the
Assessor to give such testimony, but he
declined to do so on the plea that, his cus
tomers did not desire to reveal the true
value of their property; to the -Assessor.

Duncan Is Again in Jail.
Kenneth Duncan, the ex-minister, who
has been arrested on several occasions for
helping himself to other people's property
Is locked up in^he City Prison with three
charges of petty larceny recorded against
him. The police have been looking for
Duncan for over a week, but it was not
until yesterday morning that he was ap
prehended, by Detectives. Harper and Sul
livan and Police Officer Kaskell.
Some time ago Duncan : was. -given em
ployment as a waiter in a boarding-hou^e

years later Dodge assessed the property
for $1,105,000. According to Dodge's sys
tem, the property has diminished In value
$19,000 in eleven years. There has been a
steady advance in the valuation of other
real estate on Market street in that region
of the city, but the Mayor's choice hold
ings do not increase in value, according to
Dodge's peculiar calculations.
The gracious favor of the little Mayor
may .be worth striving for in this world,
uut it ought not to be made the test' of
fitness for holding the office of Assessor.
If Dodge be wise in his day and genera
tion he will assess property according to
its value without- regard to the Mayor's
Interest therein. The new charter, the
blessed Instrument of economy. and â¢good
government, which carried so many fa
kirs and false alarm statesmen into posi
tions of brief authority, does not exempt
the Mayor's bank stock or real; estate
from equitable assessment. Dodge ought
to get out his old map and read up the
.new charter to see if he can find any
authority for the" deduction of $1,500,000
on the valuation of the stock of Phelan'a

a fine policeman, but a cold-blooded
wretch. In the old days he murdered and
pillaged as he pleased. But he has been
valuable to us. I had 124 soldiers and 18
native police in my district. One little na

high, captured three robbers who had the
cirop on him with their pistols one night.
He simply walked up to them and took
their weapons away. But the worst crim

FAVOR SHOWN TO
PHELAN'S BANK
Sweeping Deduction Made
in Behalf of First
National.
.. .
Other Financial Institutions Are
Victims of Assessor Dodge's
Arbitrary System.
SSESSOR, "WASHINGTON DODGE
// \\ ought to prepare a chart to illus-
Jl trate his peculiar system of assess
*Â¦* ing national banks. Soma explana
tion is surely necessary to dispel the im
pression that he is extending official favor
to the banking instUutions in which
Mayor Phelan is largely interested, and at
the same time visiting his official displeas
ure on banks 5n which the little Mayor
is not concerned. The chart which Dodge
exhibited during the late political cam
paign evoked frequent outbursts of ap
plause from the populace, hence he may
be encouraged to exhibit illustrations to
Â¦win the plaudits of the bankers. * '
The assessment of national banks is in a
ei-nse an arbitrary proceeding. The law
i 'â¢quires the assessment to be based on the
market value of the stock on the first
Monday of March. Deduction is made for
Government bonds and various small as-
BftS.
The stock of the Crocker-Woolworth
National Bank is not listed, and neither is
the stork of the San Francisco National
Bank. Hence quotations as to the value
of these stocks are not available. In ap
plying the arbitrary system to the Nevada
National Bank Assessor Dodge ascer
tained that a few shares of stock were
sold -at $lfcs a share. In other words, the
asked price was taken as the valuation.
Deduction was made for Government
bonds and Email assets, reducing the as
sessment to $113 per share. The deduction
amounted to $72 a share.
It Is Interesting to observe how the ar
bitrary eystcm worked when it was ap
plied to' the First National Bank, an insti
tution in which Mayor Phelan is an of
ficer and heavy stockholder. On the first
Monday of March the price asked for the
Â«ock of the First National Bank was
5290 a share. The price bid was $250. The
Etock Exchange list of April 11 quotes
First National Bank stock at $230 a share
âthe asked price. There -is hardly any
question here as to the correct valuation.
Any one other than Assessor Dodge could
readily ascertain it. Dodge, however, took
as the basis the price bid. $2.*)0 a share. He
made, deductions for. Government bond
holdings and other assets, and finalry
brought . the valuation down to $140 a
share. ? Â¦Â» . Â¦â¢. Â¦
By accepting the price bid for the stock,
$2.10. instead. of the asked price, $290, he
made a reduction on the 10,000 shares of
$400,000.- No # wonder the Mayor has money
to blow In for a new flag. He can easily
afford to buy a black flag for Dodge to
sail under when the banks are attacked
by the assessment bureau.
Looking at the figures in another light,
it is shown that the Nevada National
Bank was allowed a deduction of $72 a
share from the asked price. The deduc
tion allowed to Mayor Phelan's First Na
tional Bank was $150 a share from the
asked price, or $110 from the price bid.
The discrimination In favor of Phelan's
financial institution Is either outrageous
or the extortion applied to other banks
is grievous in the extreme. The deduc
tion of $150 a share to the First National
Bank amounts on 10,000 shares to $1,500,

T. I. Bergin, on behalf of the banking

justify the legal proceedings.

By way of Introductory he said:
"We have assembled here this evening
to extend a cordial welcome to the dis
tinguished gentlemen who have been se
lected by the President to establish civil
government In the Philippine Islands. We
also desire to present our respects to the
member of that body who has been ap
pointed from Californiaâ Professor Ber
nard C. Moses. (Prolonged applause.) We
congratulate him upon his selection, and
express our confidence In him. He will do
credit to the State and the nation in the
services he has been appointed to per
form."
Our Duty in the Islands.
Turning to the subject of the Philippine
question Judge Morrow said:
"We must maintain the sovereignty of
the United States in all places where we
have a lawful right to plant our Jlag. We
may be divided in our opinions as to the
relations, we bear toward the Filipinos,
but there Is no question that it Is our duty
to establish law and order wherever the
stars and stripes are flying.
"We mUFt be absolutely just with the
people of the Philippines; as a great na
tion we cannot afford to do otherwise.
We must deal honorably and justly with
:ill people we are called upon to protect,
always having in mind the great princi
ples of civil government established by
the immortal Washington. Our object
should be to eventually enable the natives
of the Philippines to become free and in
dependent as they gradually become
familiar with the principles of civil gov
ernment."
Professor Thomas R. Bacon of the Uni
versity of California was the first speaker
called upon. As a fellow professor he
paid a glowing tribute to the worth of
FJUENDS of Professor Bernard C.
Moses tendered h!m and his col

mission a banquet laet night in

Hotel. Tables were ppread in the' big
apartment for upward of 400 guests, and
Â«very Feat was occupied. The mo?t rep

Aside from the interest manifested in

Philippine Commissioners will have â¢ to
deal, axil vantage wa* taken of the occa
eion for the citizens of the State to ex

â¢work he has accomplished as an educator.
Incidentally the people of California take
pride in Professor Moses' appointment on
the commission, and gave evidence of
their pleasure at the banquet last even-
Hoses* Tiffany Friends.
The Invitations stated that the affair
was to be given by the friends of Profes
sor Moses. Taking this as a fact the only
deduction is that Â«>very man of promi
nence in San Francisco, Oakland and the
college town has a warm place in his
heart for California's member of the Phil
ippine Commissionâ for they were all
there.
No less hearty was the welcome ex
tended to the Eastern members of the
body. Judge Taft, who spoke for his
Eastern colleagues, said the affair was
more of a pleasure than a surprise, and
that it was not necessary for him to have
traveled 3000 miles to know that San Fran
cisco always hangs the latch string on the
outside as her reputation for hospitality
was as familiar on the shores of the At
lantic as on the Pacific Slope.
Judge W. W. Morrow presided over the
assemblage as toastmai-ter, and admirably
did he perform his duty. The speeches
were almost exclusively along the lines
of the work which is ahead of the commis
sion. Some of the orators talked expan
sion, others were against the acquisition
of new territory, while a few sought safe
ty by assuming a neutral position.
Judfre Taft Cheered.
Whitelaw Reid favored following the
flag to the earth's end and was applauded.
Judge Taft, chairman of the commission,
announced that he was an anti-expan
sionist, and would have much preferred If
the problems with which the nation was
confronted had not been presented. He
was loudly cheered, and a tiger capped
the climax of the applause that greeted
his declaration.
The guest of the evening was the last to
speak. When he arose he was given an
ovation. Cheer after cheer greeted him,
and sandwiched in between was the fa
miliar yell of the U. C.
When the menu of good things for the
inner man had been disposed of and the
intellectual food was in order Judge Mor-
Professor Moses as a public man and hla
integrity as a citizen and friend.
At the conclusion of Professor Bacon's
remarks the toastmaster Introduced
Whitelaw Reid of New York. In his in
troductory remarks Judge Morrow re
ferred to the distinguished gentleman
from the East as a member of the Peace
Commission who had been instrumental
in "removing one ulcer from the affairs of
thÂ« world and giving a free and Independ
ent Cuba." Mr. Reid was in his happiest
mood and e.ntered heartily Into the spirit
of the occasion. Briefly he said:
Occasion of Congratulation.
"This occasion is one primarily of con
gratulation and personal good will. It
would seem to one who is not entirely, a
stranger and not yet to tho manner born
that San Francisco Is well pleased with
the Pacific. Coast member of this com
mission, and this is not merely because
he is well adapted to the place. You
know himâ you know his worth. The rest
of the members you must take on recom
mendation.
"His appointment Is of absolutely no
political significance whatever.. It is one
approved alike by Republicans, Demo
crats and Dewey men. It is Indorsed by
men who indorse the administration and
also by those who think the acquisition of
the Philippines a great national mistake.
"There are too many questions of vital
importance upon which this country is at
variance. There If, however, a common
ground of mpctinsâ wo all are citizens of
the nation and all proud of the name of
Americans. There is not one with faith
or lack of. faith in the administration who
is not, after all. a patriot."
Addressing tho member" of tho com
mission, Mr. Reid paid the gathering
united In expecting It to carry out that
character of government for which it was
created, for which no part of the Ameri
can possessions was so much In need" as
the Philippines. Continuing, the speaker
said:
"We greet Professor Moses now In what
we must look upon as the beginning of a
great career. The first duty of the com
mission will be the establishment of law
and order in a land so recently given over
to crime and bloodshed. I hope the mem
bers will be able to make the best of a
situation which none of us like too well,
but It Is a situation from which we can
not escape and for which our country is
responsible. . Â¦
"Wo hesitate in extending to the
Filipinos the right of .American citizen
ship. â¢We can readily see that such action
would flood our labor market with cheap
labor and give to the natives of the China
Seas a voice In our glorious Government,
but we must give them all the rights con
sistent with justice and humanity. First,
there must be order; second, justice;
third, American civil rights, and lastly,
local self-government."
Again addressing his remarks to the
Commissioners, Mr. Reid said that If the
members allowed political motives to
guide them they would tail, and with a
"good-by and God bless you," gave way
to the next speaker. Judge W. H. Taft,
chairman of the commission.
Taft Against Expansion.
Judge Taft .said that the magnificent
welcome extended the Commissioners was
more of a gratification than a surprise.
Whether a man came from Vermont or
Tennessee or the modest plains of Ohio he
always knew the latchstrfng of San Fran
cisco was out. He was aware, as were his
colleagues, that the enthusiasm of the

ployes selected from among the Ameri
cans. If the Commissioners should try to
perpetuate any political party by their
labors they would deserve and receive the
condemnation of the world.
Sectionalism Is Dead.
General Wright of Tennessee was intro
duced as "the lawyer of the commission."
He said that there had been neither sec
tionalism nor politics in the selection of
the commission. He was a Sonthem man
and a Democrat. A few months ago he
had more fully realized than ever that
the American civil war was over, when
men from all sections of the common
country had rallied to fight together un
der the American flag. The volleys at
Santiago and at Manila had been fired
over thÂ»Â» body of dead sectionalism.
Rev. Dr. Stebblns spoke In terms com
plimentary- to Professor Moses and told
the other Commissioners something about
their colleague. This led up to calls for
Moses, and when he rose the banqueters
stood up and cheered and wafed handker
chiefs and napkins and sang "For he's a
jolly good fellow."
Professor Moses read his address from
notes. He was pleased to know that hÂ»
had friertds among his neighbors. Cali
fornia was a land where human sympathy
was broad. Referring to the. Philippines
he said that no nation to-day stood so
strongly for Justice, tempered with le
niency, as does America. It stood for
Justice and guaranteed fair dealing to all
people over whom it had. authority. In
government and politics patriotism was
what was needed. He thanked the people
of California for their splendid entertain
ment.
Judge Morrow closed the proceedings by
wishing the Commissioners- godspeed and
success.
