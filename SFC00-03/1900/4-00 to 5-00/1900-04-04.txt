J_ V willing to be a candidate for President. He authorizes the World Jo announce to the American
people that after mature reflection and in. response to the earnest entreaties from all parts of the
country, his former decision not under any circumstances to run for the Presidency, is ' rescinded. A
World correspondent saw the admiral at his home at 6 o'clock this evening^ Admiral Dczvey dictated
the anszvers to the questions and signed the notes.
"Admiral, in viciv of the many conflicting reports relative to your attitude toward a nomination
for the Presidency, will you make a'statcment to the World?"
"Yes, I realize that the time has arrived when I must definitely define my position. When I ar
rived in this country last September I said that nothing woidd induce me to be a candidate for the Presi
dency. Since then, however, I have had the. leisure and inclination to study the matter and have
reached a different conclusion, inasmuch as so many assurances have come to me from my countrymen
that I would be acceptable as a candidate for this great office.
"If the American people want me for this high office I shall be only too willing to serve them. It
is the highest honor in the gift of this nation; what citizen would refuse it?
Â¦ .' "Since studying the subject I am convinced that the office of the President is not such a very diffi
cult one to fill, his duties being mainly to execute the laws of Congress. Should Ibe chosen for this ex
alted position I zvould execute the laws of Congress as faithfully as I have always executed the orders
of my superiors."
"Is there any political significance in your trips West?"
"No; lam simply filling the engagements made months ago â long before I ever thought se
riously of the Presidency" , *

WASHINGTON. April 3.â This was
a notable day in the Senate.' It
brought to a close the sharpest
and most prolonged debate upon
any measure since those dis
cussed during the memorable "war con
gress" two years ago. At 4 o'clock this
afternoon the votes were, begun upon the
Porto Rican tariff and civil government
bill . and pending amendments . and less
than an hour later the measure about
which there has been so much contention
in and out of Congress was passed by a
majority of nine, the final vote being 40 to
31. Only committee amendments were
adopted.
It has been evident for some time that
.the bill would command a maJ6rity In the
Senate, but notwithstanding the fact the
â¢interest in the measure, both of Senators
and the public, has not flagged "an Instant.
To-day the galleries were crowded and
hundreds of persons, filled the corridors,
unable to obtain even standing room in
the galleries. From 11 o'clock, when the

ment. The particularly notable, speeches
of the" day were delivered by Mason of
Illinois in opposition to the measure, and
by Foraker of Ohio, who replied to a brief
speech by Wellington of Maryland. It was
the Ohio Senator's desire to clear up any
misunderstanding or misinformation con
cerning the bill.
Mason's speech was argumentative, elo
quent and amusing by turns, and, as it
covered the entire range of the country's
duties and responsibilities to what the
illustrious Senator sarcastically termed
"our in-su-lar possessions," it was very
interesting to his hearers.
Just before the Senate adjourned a sen
sational episode occurred in which Wol
cott of Colorado accused Lodge of Mas
sachusetts of having uttered that which
was "unqualifiedly false." The difficulty
arose over an effort made by Lodge to
have the Spooner bill made the unfinished
business. This involved the displacement
of the Quay case and the friends of â¢ the
former Senator from Pennsylvania made
things exceedingly lively for a half hour.
Meson Assails Imperialism.
Mason's speech was not confined to the
Porto Rican measure, but included. in its
scope all the problems attendant upon the
control and government of our insular
possessions. He spoke in favor of the res
olution of Wellington, which offers inde
pendence to the Filipinos, and against the*
bill proposed by Spooner of Wisconsin,
Adverting at this point to Porto Rico,
he maintained that when the treaty of
Paris was ratified the Island became &
part of the United States, and Congress
had no more right to put a duty on her
products than it had to put a tariff on
products passing between New York and*
Washington, j Â¦â¢*'.-
Unless you can get the Supreme Conrt to
stultify and reverse Itself there U but one war
to levy a tariff upon the people of the United
States to prevent their trading with the r*Â»st
of the United States. You must amend the
constitution to do tt. You must strike out
that clause of the constitution which saya all
duties must be uniform. I beg you to count the
cost of such an amendment.
We cannot say to Europe, that Is wholly for
eign and alien. "You may deliver the product of
your labor" here upon the payment of 100 per
cent of the present duty." and say to the
Porto Rlcans. "You are S5 per cent American
and 13 per cent alien, and you must pay your
pro rarta share of the Impost."
There Is no such thing as S3 per oent an
nexation. The people of Porto Rico are either
our ceople 100 per cent or they are 100 per cent
not our people.
Mason said the people of Porto Rico
had been promised by General Miles that
they should enjoy all the Immunities and
blessings of our free government. These
promises, he held, the people would de

to govern the Philippines until Congress
should otherwise direct. Incidentally he
opposed the tariff proposed to be placed
upon Porto Rican products.
He was opposed to holding the Philip
pines, "because urkler the law of nations
we have not the title and never can have
complete title except by conquest of the
inhabitants." He continued:
I do not wish the 9.000.000 Filipinos for citi
zens. I do not wish them for slaves. If we
govern them they must either be citizen* or
serfs. "Whether they labor as our citizens or
our equals before the law, or whether they la
bor as our political slaves.- their labor competes
with the labor of our country, and I am op-
p osed to that. I am for. expansion. I voted for
the annexation of Hawaii, but should never
have sent 65,000 men to compel them to accept
our flag. - In other words. I am against taking
any territory by conquest against a friendly
people, and I am against taking any territory
that brings a cheap class of labor In free and
open competition with the class, of men and
: women who do the labor in this country.
Mason resented as cowardly and unjust
any refls-ction upon his patriotism and
love for the flag because of his opinions
regarding the Philippines. He declared
that if it were treason to oppose a war
of conquest, to . lift unjust taxation, to
confer -upon the struggling people the

of Forty to Thirty-One,
ZOX DON, 'April 4, 6:40 a.jn.âXo news has yet been received, of the expected': battle between
General French. and. the Boers. There is now but a remote prospect of the capture of .the guns.
This. Jwzvcvcr, is regarded as quite trifling compared with the political effects of the disaster. As
the Bloemfontein correspondent of the Times remarks, Commandant Olivier 's strategy in rcoccupving
Ladybrand and Thaba Nchu was bold dnd even brilliant. Most of â¢ his force is composed of Free
Staters, and the advantage gained by them will have a most disturbing effect on the mind of the. Free
State population. ' 7. -. (: V'v'r.
LONDON. April 4.â A1l signs that
come from the seat of war indicate
that a great battle Is impending to
the east of Bloemfontein, probably
close to the point where the detach
ment cf Broadwood's column was am
bushed Saturday with such serious loss.
Frcin Maseru come reports that the Boers
are advancing. Firing was heard yester
day near Thaba Nchu.
While no severe engagement has appa
rently taken place yet. General Colville
has kept constantly in touch with the foe.
Evidently the Boers still hold the Bloem
fontein water works or some portion of
them and have not been dislodged by the
superior British force.
The Daily Mail's Bloemfontein corre
spondent cables that 1&00 Boers were at
the time Ftill on the hills near the water
works, and that General Colvllle was
shelling them from Bushmans Kop. while
General French was maneuvering to cut
off their retreat.
Â¦ It Is evident that the Boers are ap
proaching Bloemfontein from the north,
notwithstanding the recent dispersal of
the force etationed at Karee Siding and
the retirement from Brandfort. Probably
there are Boer commandos at Buttfonteln
to the northwest and at Paardcberg to the
west.
New evidence is given daily that the
great strength of the Boers lies In their
ability to recover their spirit quickly. Be
ing an army of Irregulars, they are not
so sensitive to defeat as disciplined
troops.
No further light i* thrown by late dis
patches on the Korn Spruit disaster. It
now appear* that only a battery and some
v.apcr.s wfro raught in the drift by the
amliUfoad'.r.K IJoers. A battery which was
behind calloped off twelve hundred yards
and opened Jiro. A Boer blast finally
drovÂ» this battery into retreat, leaving
two of its guns behind owing to the
daughter of ir.en and horses.
In the meantime a sergeant major of U
Battery, after icpcated attempts, rescued
one tun out cf six. Up to the present time
Roberts' Troops Unable to Recapture the Guns Lost by
Broadwood Saturday, and Transvaalers Are
Rapidly Advancing in Force.

3â Geoeral Cronje,
Colonel Styel aQd
1000 Boer prisooers
sailed for St. Helena
to-nigr;t.
not one of these seven guns has been re
captured.
There is no confirmation of the rumor
that a Ladysmith)commandp has been cut
to pieces by French's cavalry. .
According to the latest telegrams, the
Boers and the British were still watching
each other Monday morning near Korn
Spruit, fighting having ceased *at noon on
Sunday. The Boers continue to hold the
water works, and French is holding tho
drift of Waterval Spruit, which is one of
the three or four streams forming the
sources of the Modder.
The British cavalry commander is re
ported to be only waiting for his prepara
tions to be completed to make a move
against the enemy. The temporary loss
of the water works is not felt by the
troops or citizens of Blocmfontein, for re
serve reservoirs close to town hold a BUf
flciency of water.
The swiftness with which the situation
in the Orange Free State has changed is
a remarkable illustration of the mobility
of the Boers. It is only ten days since
Commandants Grobler and Olivier were
hurriedly retiring along the border of Ba
sutoland, pursued by the British from
Cape Colony, while French's cavalry were
supposed to be ready to cut off their re
treat. :"vr-'
From Winburg, or perhaps from Kroon
stad, comes a large force of Boers to their
comrades' aid. Grobler retraces his steps
from Smaldel, Olivier takes possession of
Ladybrand and a united' army 10,000 or
12,000 strong is gathered together in a
wonderfully short time. Totally unob
served by the British scouts, this force
hurls Itself upon Thaba Nchu, and after
ward on Sannah Post and the water
works. Thus the whole military status
has been reversed.
General Carrington's men, who are go
ing by the Belra route to Salisbury, in
Rhodesia, will probably march to Bulu
wayo, where the railway will be at their
command. The advent of this force ot
good size will make the Transvaalers fear
a raid on their capital from the north.
If Colonel Baden-Powell has been warn
ed that he must hold out until May 24, it
may be General Carrington, and not
Kitchener, Methuen or Plumer, who will
lead the relief column to Mafeklng. The
garrison reported all well up to March 20.
MANY FOREIGNERS
FOUGHT WITH BOERS
BUSHMANS KOP. April 2.â Hearing
that the water works were deserted the
correspondent ,ol t ho ' Router's Telegram*
Agency rode. forward to-day. Arriving at
the crest of a hill a volley was fired at
him and a moment later a man appeared
at the top of the crest. Calling on him to
stop firing and saying lie was ' unarmed
and desired to talk with him. the corre
spondent discovered that this man was an
American, who declared that he accom
panied the Boers only as a sightseer. He
said that never during his whole life had
he witnessed such magnificent . pluck as
that shown by the British on Saturday,
and he asserted that not only himself but
the, whole Boer army was profoundly
touched with admiration at their gallant
behavior. It appears that the Boers never
doubted their ability to capture the whole
British force and were dumfounded at
the courage displayed and the masterly
way in which the force was able to escape
from the death trap. The correspondent's
informant refused to give any information
regarding the Boer forces or their move
ments, but it appeared that the present
force was detached from Kroonstad,
joined the Ladybrand force and again di
vided north of Thaba Nchu, one portion
following the other and meeting Colonel
Broadwood's retreating force. The burgh
ers engaged consisted of Schoemann's
command, which . was accompanied by
many foreigners. Commandant John Y.
Blake was present with the Irish brigadt
and other foreigners.
The fight was marked by many acts of
individual courage. The first man to
warn the British of the ambush was a ser
geant of the army service corps, who shot
a Boer dead with his revolver. A House
hold Cavalryman, who was summoned to
surrender, threw his rifle In his captor's
face, knocking him over and escaping.
The Boers undoubtedly shot some of
the prisoners and j also killed some of
their own men who advanced to demand
the British to surrender, and laterâac
cording to the testimony of eye-witnesses,
the Boers shot some of the prisoners, but
the confusion was so greatâ the flre pro
ceeding from all directions and the Boers

Culberson took strong grouud against
relegating thÂ«Â» control of the affairs of
Porto Rico to Congress, uncontrolled by
constitutional provisions. Congress was
apt to be partisan, and. such being the
fact, profligacy and oppression were to be
expected. As for himself, he prayed God
that the time would never, come when
Congress or any other power should have
unlimited control over the humblest Indi
vidual in the country.
The order for fifteen minute speeches or
less then went Into effect. Clay of Geor
gia addressed himself largely to showing
what he designated the- inconsistencies of
the supporters of the pending bill. The
original measure, he said, was diametri
cally opposed in its provisions to the
pending bill, providing, as it did, for a
territorial form of government. It was
also in keeping with the President's mes
sage. He recognized no message from the
President that was riot official and there
fore still regarded the President as favor
able to free trade with Porto Rico, re
gardless of the assurances of Senators
and the Speaker of the House. Clay said
his objection to the bill was based on the
fact that it violated fundamental prin
ciples and sacred pledges and was the first
step leading to untold wrong.
Ross of Vermont laid stress upon the
importance of proceeding with care in
this crisis. He thought the constitution
had not extended to Porto Rico upon the
signing of the. peace treaty and argued
that it would be unwise to extend it by
legislation. He said he thought free trade
should be established as soon as possible
between the United States and Porto Rico.
He would, however, subordinate some of
his opinions and vote for the measure.
Senator Teller's Protest.
Teller entered his protest against the
pending bill. H* would vote against it,
not because it levied a duty on Porto
Rican products â he did not object to thai
provision: but he did believe the United
States ought to treat the people of Porto
Rico as !t was proposed to treat those of
Cuba.
He believed Congress had ample power
to ]egi^latÂ« for the people of Porto Rico
under the treaty of Paris. He said a
great deal had been said about what we
owed the Pftrto Ricans.
â¢'We owe them nothing," he declared.
"Thic Congress may fix the status of Ihe
inhabitants of the island and its control
over them in that respect is absolute. I
am not opposed to a tariff on Porto Rican
.products. If we had a colony we should
give its people either a tariff or free
trade."
Bacon rÂ»f Georgia adverted to what he
termed the "evolution, of the pending
bill." showing it had developed from a
frf-e trade to a tariff measure. The pro
vision relating to the citizenship of the
people had likewise been changed. When
this bill snould ra^s it would be the first
law declaring that people for whom Con
gres? Dud legislated were not citizens of
Jh" T'nitfd States. It was indeed a his
toric occasion. .Â¦ i-.i
"Wellington of Maryland opposed the
pending measure, but said he had stood
leady to support the bill first presented
to the Senate upon the subject. That bill
had been regarded as Just and constitu
tional. "But." he said, "the legislative
monstrosity now before us transgresses
every principle of national honor, patriot
ism, good faith and justice. I am com
pelled, therefore, to part from my col
leagues of the Republican majority and
vote against this bill."
Foraker said the speech of Wellington
made It appropriate for him to say, at
th*> close of- the debate, so far as the
pending bill was concerned there had been
nothing unusual or different from.legisla
tion generally.
Proctor of Vermont inquired why the
President, the Secretary of War and Gen
eral Davis, the Governor" of Porto Rico,
had not Â«een and noted the necessity for
a tariff on Porto Rican products.
- Forskerâ I do not know why it did not occur
to them; perhaps it did. What I do know is
Ahat the subject was thorouKhly and impartially
invf-stigatrii and the necessity for the legisla
tion proposed now established beyond quibble
by our 'Â¦ommittep.
Tlllman- Did that necessity change the polit
ical status of the people of Porto Rioo from cit
izens cf the United States to citizens of Porto
Rico?
Forakerâ No; that was not the reason. The
rr-ason for that change was the opposition cf
Democratic Senators. They maintained that
the conferring- of citizenship of the United
States upon the people of the island was a prac
tical extension of the constitution over the peo
ple of the island. That is the reason we made
the change.
Bebuke to General Miles.
It was not for General Miles to speak for thp
Government ac to political policy; that was for
Conpre*g. His duty was to carry the flag- there
as h<Â« gallantly did. The Secretary of War had
made no ptedsre. As for the President, It was
his enemies who were asÃumtne to represent
him. He had recommended that we gfve the
Porto Rlcans free trade. That is just what
this bill does. True, for a time a duty Is im
posedâfor lew than twenty-three monthsâ to
meet an emergency. There would be absolute
free trade sooner If the Porto Rlcans should
ark it tn the proper way. Furthermore, abso
lute and present free trade was vouchsafed by
the bill on practically nearly all essential ar
ticles. In view of this fact there was ho viola
tion of pledjre* or contradiction of the Presi
dent's recommendations. ThÂ« President had
not called for free trade on "the day that his
TOH-saK* was issued, but had recommended it as
a line of policy.
Galllnger supported thÂ© bill, saying
there was no proposition to treat the peo
ple of Porto Rico any worse than the resi
dent* of the District of Columbia; all of
whom were governed without their con
sent. > . -Â¦- :;_. r 1 -

to say exactly what happened.
Explosive bullets have been found In

strong, mustered at the end only . ten

The Boers seem to he in great

THIS REICHMAN NOT
THE MILITARY ATTACHE

the BoÂ«r army, for so far forgetting the
dignity and purpose of his mission, as to
take active. part as a leader of the Boers
in the recent battle *at Bushmans Kop
He is not the man to whom it is reported
the British owe their defeat on that oc
casion. There are two Reichmans with
the Boer army who have held commis
sions in the United States army. The
one, Captain Carl Reichman, still holds
his commission and was sent to the
Transvaal in January last to observe the
operations of the Boer forces, and except
for the fact that his name is the same
as that of the alleged Boer leader in the;
recent battle there is no reason to believe
that he has forgotten the neutral- char
acter of his mission and done anything
to compromise himself with his own Gov
ernment or that Government with Great
Britain.
The other Captain Reichmanâ the Boer
Relchmanâ did once hold a commiasion as
lieutenant in the United States army, but
resigned some years ago while stationed
at Phoenix, Ariz., and sought a more ex
citing field for his energies and talents in
South Africa. He was in Johannesburg
at the time of the Jameson raid and took
service with the Transvaal Government
in the operations which led to the cap
ture of the raiders. He kept up his con
nection with the Transvaal military or
ganization and when the present war
broke out was appointed to an important
command in the Boer forces "operating
along and south of the Orange River. He
was with General Schoeman at Stormberg
on December 10 and took such a leading
part in the .capture of the Irish Fusiliers
and the Gloucesters on that occasion as
to win special commendation from Presi
dent Kruger. Commandant Reichman.
like Captain Reichman of the United
State* army, Is of German birth, but be
came naturalized in this country over
twenty years ago. By taking service with
the Boers, however, he. of course, forfeits
all claim to citizenship in the, United
States. Harry Hill of this city, with his
brother Howard, served under Reichman
during the Jameson tronble and is well
qualified to speak as to his identity. How

him. Is now serving with the Boer forces.
pressed his intention, however, to vote for
the bill, which, he said, upon the whole,
was a liberal measure. . "
When the hour of 4 o'clock was reached
the chairman announced that the votes
upon the pending amendments and the
bill should now be taken.
At the. suggestion of Foraker the com
mittee amendments which had been
passed over were reverted to and adopted
without division.
Davis (R.)-of Minnesota then offered
his amendment. providing that "no duties
ort imports or exports shall, after the
passage of this act, be levied or collected
on any articles imported from the United
States into Porto Rico or from Porto Rico
Into th,e United States."
Mr. Davis demanded the ayes and noes.
The amendment was lost. 30 to 40, the de
tailed vote being as follows:
Ayesâ Allen, Bacon. ,Bate, Perry. Clark of
Montana, Clay, Cookrell. Culberson. Daniel.
Davis (Republican), Harris, Heitfeld, Jones

Pairs were announced as follows, those
first mentioned being favorable to the
amendment: Cafferyâ Burrows-; Chiltonâ
Elkins: Rawlinsâ Hanna; HoarâMcEn
ery: Malloryâ Hale: Turnerâ Warren; Pet
tigrewâAldrich; Butlerâ McCumber.
Beveridge was the only absentee who
was not paired. He has a regularpair with
Clark of Montana and that Senator an
nounced that, if present, Beveridge would
vote for the amendment.
Without division two other amendments
offered by Davis were^ defeated. Then
Nelson (R.) of Minnesota offered his free
trade amendment. The ayes and noes
were ordered and this amendment, too,
was lost â 29 to 41. After an amendment
offered by Spooner (R.) of Wisconsin,
making a slight change in -the measure,
had been .accepted by Foraker, and agreed
to, two amendments offered by Bacon (D.)
of Georgia, one being n substitute for the
entire bill, were defeated without division.
Bill Passed as Amended.
The bill was then reported to the Senate,
the amendments were agreed to and on an
aye and no vote it passed by a vote of 40
to 31, a majority of 9. Following is the
detailed vote upon the measure:
" Ayes â Allison. Baker. Bard, Carter. Chandler,

The only change in the pairs on tlje
final vote related to Beveridge of Indiana.
Clark of Montana announced that he un
derstood that, if present, Beverldge would
v.te for the bill. He, therefore,* trans
ferred his pair to Rawllns (D.) of Utah.
This permitted both Clark and Hanna
(Rawlins' pair) to vote.
Scarcely had the Porto Rican bill been
disposed of when quite unexpectedly -a
serious snarl over the case of former Sen
ator Quay arose. Acting under the unani
mous consent agreement reached on
March 16, that the Quay case should be
taken up to-day, "subject to the consid
eration of appropriation bills, conference
reports, the present unfinished business
ana Senate bill 2355" (the Spooner bill a/
to the government of the Philippinesi,
Lodge moved that the Spooner bill be
made the unfinished business. This was
objected to by the friends of Quay, and
Wolcott (R.) of Colorado moved to ad
journ. The motion was lost, 29 to 29. Â»
Lodge then renewed his motion and
again Wolcott moved to adjourn, but his
motion was lost, 29 to 29. A long wrangle
ensued and when at 5:55. the Senate ad
journed, the situation was still strained
and the status of thÂ« Quay case unset
tled.
HOLLANDER PROTESTS
AGAINST THE TARIFF
WASHINGTON. April 3.â During the
debate on the Porto Rican bill to-day
Senator Fairbanks presented the follow
ing cablegram from Governor General
Davis of Porto Rico:-
SAN JUAN DR PORTO CICO, March 29.â
Letter >>y next mail from Prefessor Hollander,
strongly advising against legislative require
ment of United States Internal revenue laws or
fixed percentage thereof for Porto Rico. He
urces that tax system for this Island phoulrt
be made to suit local conditions and harmonize
with home, requirements. Hope of attaining
Buch system will be unrealizable If unsuited
tÂ«x laws are forced on the island and proper
measures prevented. DAVIS. Â¦-â¢
Senator Fairbanks explained that Pro
fessor Hollander is an expert on questions
of taxation, who was sent to Porto Rico
at the request of General Davis to make
a study of those questions. ".
PRESIDENT KRUGERâ TaIk of peace terms ? Why, we've just begun to- fjghtV.
g . âExchange.
LONDON/ April 3.â Queen Victoria, who
left Windsor Castle at half-past 9 o'clock
last evening en route for Ireland, arrived
at Holyhead at 9:10 a. m. to-day. The au
thorities of the place, officers of the war
ehips in the harbor and a guard of honor
awaited the arrival of her Majesty. The
general public was excluded from the sta
tion. When the Queen alighted she was
presented with .the usual address of wel
come. She gave her reply to Lord Den
bigh, who handed it to the officials. It
"I thank you for your loyal and dutiful
welcome and tor your expressions of de
votion to my throne and person. Tnw
practical and generous sympathy for
those who have suffered or who are likely
to suffer in consequence of the present
war which has been shown by all classes
of my subjects has been a great consola
tion to me during the time of suspense
and anxiety through which we are pass
ing. I join in your hearty prayer that
peace may soon be restored and that the
other blessings o9 heaven be long -con
tinued to my empire, and I wish all pros
perity to the country you represent.'"
The Queen walked across the platform
leaning on the arm of her Indian attend
ant, and later embarked on board the
royal yacht Victoria and Albert, which,
piloted by the Irene, escorted by the
royal yacht Osborn and the cruisers Gala
tia and Australia, steamed out of the har
bor for Kingstown.
DUBLIN, April 3.â The royal yacht Vic
toria and Albert with Queen Victoria on
board arrived at Kingstown at 2 o'clock
this afternoon, three and a half hours
ahead of the scheduled time, and was
greeted with a royal salute from the chan
nel squadron. Rain has been falling all
morning. . - -. - Â¦ . â¢Â¦
The royal yacht lay off Kingstown, no
one disembarking from her. and no onÂ«
will leave the vessel until to-morrow.
Only a handful of persona saw the arrival
of her Majesty.
The premature arrival of her Majesty
and the wretched weather were a disap
pointment to Dublin, as thousands of peo
ple had planned to go out to Kingstown.
Nevertheless, as soon as the news spread
a large number started for the scene,
while the. Duke of Connaught, commander
of the forces in Ireland, and Earl Cado
gan, Lord Lieutenant, also hurried there,
and late in the afternoon boarded the
royal yacht Victoria and Albert, where
they greeted the Queen. James Egan, the
Dublin city swordbearer, who for nine
years was imprisoned for political of
fenses, refused to-day to hand the Queen
the sword, nor would he take part in to
morrow's proceedings. This declination
at the last hour caused a sensation, and
the Lord Mayor is now looking for an
other swordbearer. In a letter to th*
Town Clerk Mr. Egan says:
"I will yield nothing to any Irishman in
respect for the individuality of the agett
lady, but I cannot Join in any act of pub
lic courtesy toward the head of a stats
which has tried me upon charges that
were false and sent me to suffer for ninr
years in English dungeonsâ the state that
still hallmarks me with the degradation
of a ticket-of-leave man."
Mr. Egan adds that he Is prepared to
accept the consequences and hand in his
resignation.
The activity of the daring thieves* who
have poured into Dublin was evidenced
during the night, when $15.0n0 worth of
jewel ry was coolly abstracted from a
Grafto'n-street jeweler. The decorations
are suffering sadly from the rain, but this
does not stop the work of decoration, as
still more buntin*? is being displayed and
every Incoming train is crowded with ex
cursionists.
FAMOUS ESTATE
IS TO BE SOLD
Great Glenn Ranch Will Be Cut
Up and Disposed of at Public
Sale in the Near Future.
Immense Tract of Over Forty-Two Thousand
Acres, Known All Over the World, Must
Go to Lift a Mortgage.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
UJ'.i.t.U.s, April 3.â The executors and
managers of the great Glenn estate, the
largest and richest wheat-growing ranch
In the world, announce that the property
will be put on sale in subdivisions or
imal! farms during this summer and fall.
To the people of Willows this is most
tncouraginÃ news. The Glenn ranch em
braces about 42.J0.1 acres of very rich soil,
snd nou'lii-ro t !sÂ«> in California can there
be found a sinplo large body of land so
rapaMe of producing crops of. all kinds in
Fuch abundance as have been grown on
this property. This is a fact known all
over i\y- world, for th>* great tract has
l>een visin-d by rich foreigners, pictured
by magazines. anÂ«! talked of throughout
Korope and America. The property was
originally an old Spanish grant, the Ja
rinto Rancbp. and fame into the poss*s-
Fion of Hugh J. Glenn many years ago,
when it \v.-is an immense stock range.
Glenn was a man who knew the worth of
land Â«nd be commenced plowing up large
portions of the â¢ property and planting
grain. The confidence of the man in the
capabilities of the sui! was so firm that
he paid 15 per cent yearly interest on
over a million dollars of borrowed money,
nn<l when the proposed new constitution
eras about to shift the mortgage tax on
the mortgagee Ghenn easily procured the
Mine loan from Eastern banks* at 9 per
cnt. when Sun Francisco bankers ni.de
pmte>:s ;il>out the tax.
Olonn became very prominent politically
$n thf ranks of -Democracy, and was made
the I)< mocratic -nominee for Governor,
tvhh George C. Perkins and William F.
White, faiher of Stephen M. White, us
I,'s opponents, denii'n nomination was
mainly due lo the fact that he took a
f>lid stand for the new constitution, and
when capitalists threatened to foreclose
on him it but made hi? stand more firm.
The great ambition of Hugh Glenn was
t.i "grow 1.000.000 bushels of wheat and
*ell it for $1,000,000," but his tragic and
untimely death, the facts of which "are
familiar to Californians, prevented the
consummation of this ambition-.
It has long been the hope of Willows
people that this enormous property would
be out up into small farms. The .Glenn
property extends about twenty miles
alunp the western bank of the Sacra
mento River as it .courses northward from
Butte City. Thus the products, or these
s=m4Jl farms can be transported to mar
ket by both rail and water. Steamboats
and barsres come up the river regularly
from Sacramento at all times cf the year
and the matter of cheap transportation Is
already solved. -
A very gratifying fact is that the exe
cutors pf the estate will allow purchasers
â¢to select tracts anywhere and everywhere,
after the surveyors have completed their
work of platting, ami prices for the land
will not be placed at an exorbitant fig
ure.' Some of the tracts will be sold at
$10 per acre, others at $15. a great many
at $20 and $25. and some at $30 and $35. Â¦
The property of the estate is now mort
gaged for $GOO.OOO. and It is to remove this
indebtedness that the land is to be sold.
The terms of sale will be cash, but it will
be an easy matter for a purchaser to
raise money on such property as this.
The thousands of head of horses, mules,
cattle and shtep. besides all of the Im
plements and other eueh property owned
by the estate, will be sold at auction.
If the sale of the Glenn property proves
to be a success, F. C. Lusk, who also
manages the Boggs estate and the Walsh
grant, will place those Immense proper
ties on sale, and the Immigration prob
lem as applying to this section of the
State will be a matter solved.

Court to Visit Her Child Once
During Each Twenty-Four
Hours.
LOS ANGELES. April 3.â An air of ex
pectancy hovered over Judge York's
courtroom at 9 o'clock this morning, for
at that hour Colonel Marceau had been
ordered to appear with Theodore Marceau
Jr., for the possession of whom' a legal
battle that has had few equals in Cali
fornia is in progress.
As the big door swung open a baby's
voice was heard to utter "When will
mamma be here?" The little one toddled
in by the side of the late attache of the
Governor's staff.
As Colonel Marceau paused to speak to
his attorneys Mrs. Marceau, handsomely
gowned in a suit of black silk and
wearing a pompadour hat, swept into the
room. Before she took her seat Baby
Marceau ran to her and looked supremely
happy as the mother clasped htm to her
arms and^ kissed him again and again.
After the mother had fondled the boy for
a few minutes she put him down and he
went to his father, who held the tiny hand
with a strong grip. After preliminary
sparring, which did not expose the merits
of the case of either side, the attorneys
consulted and Judge York reset the case
tor Monday, April 9.
Colonel Marceau's attorneys did not ob
ject to the postponement, but when a de
mand was made that Mrs. Marceau be
allowed to see her son daily Judge Variel,
who has been brought into the case since
yesterday to aid Marceau's cause, entered
a veto and declared that the child would
not again be allowed out of Colonel Mar
ceau's custody if it could be prevented.
Judge York stated that Mrs. Marceau
could see the child every day at 4 o'clock
in the afternoon. He did not say the child
should be brought to Mrs. Marceau. The
mother declares she will not enter the
photograph gallery of her husband, and
that it will be brought to her.
When the court proceedings had been
completed Mrs. Marceau waited outside of
the door. When Theodore Jr. passed her
she moved her hand to the boy and said
"Good-by. dearie." The boy could not
answer, for he was hurried toward the
grated elevator. As father and son wait
ed and as the boy walked down the corri
dor toward his mother he said: "When
will my mamma be here, and why doesn't
she come now?" Neither father nor
mother looked at each other, and the
boy's question received no answer.

Advises Against Taking Ad

Plight.
Premier Replies to c Speech TJrging
That the Egyptian Question Be
Brought Up at This
Time.
PARTS, April 3.â ln the Senate to-day
during the debate on the foreign budget
Comte Dannay drew attention to the re
lations of France with Great Britain and
pointed out that, in the negotiations re
specting the French concession at Shang
hai,* Great Britain was at first obstinate,
but on the outbreak of difficulties In South
Africa changed her tone and became more
conciliatory.
"The war in South Africa," said the
Senator, "has shown England j that her
policy of splendid isolation is certainly
not the best safeguard for her interests.
I, therefore, consider the moment oppor
tune for France to raise the question of
Egypt. A rupture between France and
Great Britain will be a misfortune for
civilization and the mutual respect of the
two nations is the best means of avert
ing it."
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, M. Del
casse, replied:
"Both nations have many reasons to
consider their rights and dignity In the
questions they have to solve. It Is not
the time to speak here of ridiculous
threats. The time has not yet come to
tell all the truth of the Fashoda episode,
but- neither France nor the Government
has anything to fear from the publication
of the facts. History will say the last
word. All I can say now is that the Gov
ernment took into consideration the dis
proportion between the end and the effort
necessary to attain it. The treaty of 18S9
secured for us serious advantages. Since
then we have had to negotiate grave ex
ternal questions. The treaty of commerce
concluded with the United States is ad
vantageous to our industry and agricul
ture, and the negotiation respecting
Shanghai has secured a recognition of our
rights. The incident In the Antilles was
settled to our satisfaction and In Africa
we are beginning a methodical develop
ment of our domination.
"In England we have received a re
newal of the mixed tribunal law. These
results are excellent and they are so rec
ognized abroad. They are questioned in
France with the ulterior motive of over
throwing the Cabinet, even though the
country should succumb at the same
time.
"You have seen the odious campaign
against our foreign policy. As Tartuffe
took the mask of virtue, so a certain
party takes the mask of patriotism. But
it will not succeed any more than did
Tartuffe.
"France, gentlemen, is a great Euro
pean power. She has become a great co
lonial power. Our extension has been
marvelously rapid, but we must exploit
the riches of our new colonies with the
capital of old France. We must defend
them with our own resources. Among the
powers which formerly disputed our su
premacy some nave grown greater and
others of more recent growth are striving
to reach the first rank.
"We must struggle. We must form
virile generations. We must develop our
economic organization. France by intel
ligent work must be maintained as the
great road of the world. Our fleet must
regain the necessary strength. I trust
the Senate will agree with me that such
considerations are not out of place in
making explanations regarding our for
eign policy." >
. M. Delcasse resumed his seat amid the
heartiest applause.
THE FEAR OF HUMBUG.
Prevents Many People From Trying
a Good Medicine.
Stomach troubles are so common and In
most cases so obstinate to cure that peo-
ple are apt to look with suspicion on any
remedy claiming to be a radical, perma-
nent cure for dyspepsia and indigestion.
Many such pride themselves on their
acuteness in never being humbugged, es-
pecially in medicines.
Tnis fear of being humbugged can be
carried too far; so far, in fact, that minj
people suffer for years with weak diges-
tion rather than risk a little time and
money in faithfully testing the claims
made of a preparation so reliable and uni-
versally used as Stuart's Dyspepsia' Tab-
lets.
Now Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are
vastly different in one important respect
from ordinary proprietary medicines for
the reason that they are not a secret pat-
ent medicine. No secret is made of their
ingredients, but analysis shows them to
contain the natural digestive ferments,
pure aseptic pepsin, the digestive acids.
Golden Seal, bismuth, hydrastis and nux.
They are not cathartic, neither do they
act powerfully on any organ, but they
cure indigestion on the common sense
plan of digesting the food eaten thor-
oughly before it has time to ferment, sour
and cause the mischief. This ia the only
Beeret of their success.
Cathartic pills never have and never can
cure Indigestion and stomach troubles be-
cause they act entirely on the bowels,
whereas the whole trouble is really In the
stomach.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets taken after
meals digest the food. That is all there ia
to it. Food not digested or half digested
Is poison, as it creates gas, acidity, head-
aches, palpitation of the heart, loss of
flesh and appetite and many other troubles
which are often called by some other
name. ; " 'â¢Â¦\ i .': Â¦ ,-"^.;.' : ?;-..:
STABLEMAN IS
SHOT TO DEATH
AT BURLINGAME
Thomas Hankin Murdered
as the Result of a
Trivial Quarrel.
George Williams Arrested for the
Crime and Declares That He
Acted Merely in Self-
Defense.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDWOOD CITY, April 3.â A tragedy
occurred at Burllngame this morning.
Thomas Hankin was shot to death by
George Williams. The two men have been
working about the stables of Prince Pon
latowskl for several months past. Yester
day evening Hankin went to San Mateo
and became intoxicated, going back to
Burlingame about 12:30 o'clock this morn-
Ing. Upon reaching the stables he went
to the room of Williams, where the two
men quarreled, but finally retired. This
morning the quarrel was resumed and
blows exchanged. Williams then went to
another building and procured a loaded
shotgun and Hankin went about his work.
The former complained to Foreman
Charles Davis and Davis sought Hankin,
warning him either to -cease his quarreling*
or leave the place. Shortly after 10:30
o'clock Williams was seen by Davis com
ing in his direction with a gun. Davis
warned him not to use the gun.
Williams said: "No, I won't unless I
have to."
Williams complained again of Hankin
and said he had been quarreling after be
ing warned by Davis to desist. Hankin
overheard him and said to him:
"You are a liar."
"You are a liar yourself," retorted Wil
liams.
At this Hankin dropped a bucket of oats
with which he was feeding the horses and
started after Williams. It was then that
the latter raised his gun and flred a load
of shot In riankln's breast. Hankin fell
dead.
Williams was soon after arrested and
brought to this place. - Both men are com
parative strangers and but little is known
of them, except that Williams has worked
for the Stanford Palo Alto farm. Wil
liams absolutely refuses to say anything
about the affair other than to say It was
in self-defense.
PRINCIPALS IN THE FORTHCOMING MARRIAGE.
Drew, who afterward turned over the case I
to the law firm of Reddy, Campbell Â«fc
Metson, with which he was connected. â¢
The case was tried in Ukiah and was '
fought out for fou&-weeks. and the result I
was an absolute verdict in favor of the |
widow. During the trial and the month 3 [
of litigation preceding it Drew was Mrs.
Whites confidential adviser. The kind
ness of the adviser and th-Â» gratitude of
the widow whose interests Drew so care- I
fully guarded slowly but surely blossomed
diet-to-be hosts of friends, every one of
whom will rejoice at his splendid fortune.
Although Mrs. White is . an extremely
wealthy woman. thÂ«- man she Is so shortly
to marry is by no means poor, and though
his fortune is small In comparison to hist
bride's. Drew's private income Is not one
to be despised.
In preparation for the approaching wed
ding Mrs. White has come down from her
Ukiah home and Is at present located at
the Palace Hotel.
FRANK C. DREW, court reporter
in Judge Lawlor's court. Is getting
ready to slip on the matrimonial
yoke and stand a proud and happy
man before the altar with Mrs. W.

Although Drew has won the heart and
the promise of the hand of one of the
wealthiest women of the State, he is go
ing quietly about his official duties with
only one care in the worldâ the guarding
of his secret from a host of friends who
stand ready, at the propitious moment, to
offer congratulations and shower him and
his bride with rice and old shoes.
The -wedding of the fortunate couple is
the culmination of a delightful romance in
which dry and musty law and the endless
ennui of a litigation involving millions
brushed elbows with Venus" saucy boy.
White, who was known as the lumber
king of Ukiah. died a little more than a
year ago, leaving his entire estate, which
consists of the Greenwood Lumber Com
pany and valued at over a million dollar*,
to his widow. The will was disputed by
White's sister, who claimed that the lum
ber king was of unsound mind when his
will was executed.
In the contest that followed the widow's
interest was at first represented by Frank

A MIGHTY column of water, leaping
eighty feet into the air, then
feathering in the wind and drench
ing pedestrians and buildings alike
for half a block around, attracted
thousands of spectators to the corner of
Seventh and Minna streets early last
evening. Away from this strangely locat
ed geyser that roared as though a vent
for pent-up forces in the bowels of the ]
earth there ran a swift stream, wide and
deep, which cut under the cobbles., tore
up the roadway, dislodged the dilapidated
wooden sidewalks of the neighborhood !
and flooded cellars along its entire course.
Shortly after 6 o'clock Henry Frederick,
n. driver for J. Cassady. left his truck
standing at a watering trough across the
street. His team, a splendid pair of spir
ited Normans, suddenly took fright and
dashed across the street. 1'rederick, who
v.as standing near, leaped into the truck
and grasped the lines, but the horses
dashed straight over the sidewalk on the
east side, over the hydrant at the corner
and took away a portion of Henriolle's
liquor store. The tremendous force of
the water lifted the heavy iron hydrant
and hurled it over the heads of the horses
down Minna street. The roaring of the
stream terrorized the horses, but several
men controlled them by line and bit and
got them to a place of safety. Hundreds
of people rushed out of harm's way and
hundreds more, seeing the rushing water,
hurried to the scene and It was a miracle
that no one was injured. Officer Peter J.
Mitchell telephoned the station and the
t^pring Valley Water Works were notified.
t->everal men soon arrived on the scene,
but found that all of the valves controll
ing the flow were jammed. For an hour
and three Quarters thev worked In the
drenching downpour before the pipe was
tir.ally closed, and when it was. the entire
neighborhood was deprived of water for
another hour while the f-nil of the broken
hydrant was being plugged. The policer^% CHICHCSTCR'S ENGLISH

ADVERTISEMENTS.
GODCHAUX WILL
YIELD TO CIVIL
SERVICE BOARD
Mayor Phelan Prevails on
the Recorder to Comply
With the Charter.
The differences existing between Re
corder Godchaux on the one side and the
Civil Service Commission on the other
were amicably settled late yesterday aft
ernoon. Mayor Phelan, who had inform
ed the commission that he would use the
authority vested in him by the charter to
compel the observance of Its laws re
garding civil service by derelict city offi
cials, was in conference with Godchaux
most of the day. The Mayor Insisted on
Godchaux complying with the civil ser
vice regulations at once. Godchaux
pleaded for more time on the ground that
the efficiency of his office would be im
paired if a complete new force was forced
upon him, but tne Mayor was obdurate.
It was finally agreed that Godchaux
should make a requisition for ten copy
ists to-day and another ten before April
15. Accordingly, t-e first twelve men on
the eligible list were sent to him as he
called for male copvlsts, the charter per
mitting him to specify the sex.
Godchaux was also Informed by the
commission that the' ten men copyists who
would be replaced by eliglbles from the
civil service list would not be allowed pay
for the last two days they had served the
government, as he had been notiiied that
the sixty-day term for which the staff
had beisn appointed had been shortened to
twenty-three, thus doing away with the
original appointments on last Saturday.
Godchaux will accordingly discharge ten
of his copyists to-day, but the other ten
which he will retain will work without
pay, as they are considered out of the
municipal employ so far a3 the civil ser
vice is concerned. Three of the present
forceâ J. Hayes, C. Cosgrave and E. Sul
livanâare sufficiently high on the list to
come within the names submitted to God
chaux by the commission and they will In
all probability keep their positions.
The deposed copylÃts will, however, take
the matter to the courts and have re
tained an attorney to handle the litiga
tion in that connection.
County Clerk Deane also made a re
quisition for five male copyists, and the
names of seven eligibles were sent to him
by Secretary Moran. Of his sixteen copy
ists he has appointed one and the re
maining ten are engaged on probate work,
which will be finished in a few days, and
he will then make a requisition for ten
more copyists.

WIELDERS OF RODS TO
COMPETE IN THE EAST
The regular monthly meeting of the San
Francisco Fly-casting Club u-as not held
last night, owing to lack of a quorum.
An informal discussion was indulged in
by the members present over the condi
tions of the various trout streams and the
possibilities of the season.
The open to the world tournament of the
Chicago Fly-casting Club to be held Au
gust 16 and 17 is interesting the members.
Walter D. Mansfield, the champion at the
game, will surely be a competitor. It Is
probable he will be accompanied by A. E.
Lovett and Colonel C. G. Young, both of
whom are In the champion class. Reuben
Leonard of New York, who held the rec
ord for years until Mr. Mansfield attacked
it, will be among those who enter the list.
Thomas B. Mills, another New York
champion, will also compete. Teams from
Grand Rapids, Baltimore, Boston and
Milwaukee are expected to join in making
the tournament of interest wherever the
art of fishing is practiced.

Gray Again Escapes Conviction.
In the case of the United States of
America against Frederick Gray, charged
with having counterfeiter's tools In his
possession, the Jury yesterday in the
United States District Court failed to
agree after having been out four hours
and a quarter. They were thereupon dis
charged by Judge de Haven. This was
Gray's third trial, the two former Juries
having disagreed also. It is likely that
tbe prosecution will be dropped.
AMATEUR REINSMEN TO
HOLD RACE MATINEE
Golden Gate Park Driving Associa
tion Decides to Rttn Off Two
Events on the Speed Track.
The Golden Gate Park Drivine Associa
tion, which is composed of the foremost
horse-owne-^ of this city, will hold a
racing matinee on the afternoon of Sat
urday, April 21. Two events will be run
off over tne speed track in Golden Gate
Park, and a number of owners of fast
animals have expressed their intention of
testing the speed of their horses.
This was decided at a meeting of tha
anociation held last night in their head
quarters at the Palace, other important
business was also transacted. A com
mittee, composed of E. Aigeltinger, E.
Stewart, F. G. O'Kane and Fred Thomp
son, was selected to call on the Park
Commissioners and request that the
brush that now incumbers the speed
track be cut away, as it retards a view
of the track and Is also a menace to tho
lives of those driving over it. J. M. Eva
of the California Fuse Company, A. P.
Welch, the capitalist, and Leo Nolan,
the shoe man, were elected to member
ship. Twenty-.lve entries have- already
been received for the trotting racea to be
held, under the auspices of tho associa
tion on Decoration day at the Emery
ville track. The events this year prom
ise to be extremely interesting. The
best horses on the coast will compete and
many new records are likely to be estab
lished.
WILSON FIGURES
OUT EXPENSE OF
PACIFIC MUSEUM
Sum of Thirty-Five Thou
sand Dollars Per Annum
Will Suffice. .
Director Wilson of the Philadelphia
Commercial Museum at a meeting of the
promoters of the Pacific Commercial
Museum yesterday afternoon stated that
$30,000 per annum would be sufficient to
establish a commercial museum in this
city and assure success, with good man
agement and tho hearty co-operation of
the Philadelphia Museum. Skilled men
would be indispensable to conduct the
buslnesSj he said, and it would be well
for San Francisco to send out its own
commissioners to foreign countries bor
dering on the Pacific in search of samples
and .information. Philadelphia, -he con
tinued would co-operate thoroughly with
San Francisco and the samples and In-
formation that were to be freely supplied
would be worth three times the amount
of the $50,000 appropriation for which the
museum promoters ceased to press when
It was learned that to continue to urge it
would mean failure of the appropriation
for Philadelphia. St. Louis, Chicago and
New York are talking about establishing
institutions modeled on the Philadelphia
'Director Wilson said there should be a
compact that the San Francisco and Phil
adelphia institutions would stand to-
X Mr. Wilson 6poke over an hour. He
said the salary list of the Philadelphia
Museum was JMO.OOO per year; that it had
KS employes; that it had its own printing
plant; that the annual membership fee
was $100; that the receipts last year, all
of which went to the promotion of the
work, amounted to $71,000 In addition to
the appropriation by the city of Phila
delphia.
On motion of Arthur Rodgers a vote of
thanks to Mr. Wilson was adopted. It
was also voted to help Philadelphia to
get the national appropriation of $200,000
that is sought. This afternoon the ex
ecutive committee of the Pacific Com
mercial Museum will meet at 3:30 o'clock
at 222 Market street.
THE discussion over carload rates
Jim! !r?s than carload, rates, differ
entials and the effect the whole
complicated assortment of subjects
would have on the Pacific Coast
jobbers was resumed yesterday morning
before the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion, now in session in this city.
On the whole the Pan Francisco whole
salers presented strong testimony against
the readjustment of differentials prayed
for by the jobbers ot the Middle West.
The disadvantages under which the local
wholesalers compete with the piratical
practices of their competitors of the Mid
dle West was brought out forcibly by the
evidence of thoFe competent to testify to
the existing conditions and the result
that would follow if the St. Louis Busi
ness Men's Association triumphed In its
present fight. ;- ; :
It was shown that the Pacific Coast
had been made the dumping ground for
the surplus stock of the Middle West Job
bers, glad to deliver their extra goods
here at cost in order to get rid of them,
and now striving to force our own deal
ers to the wall in order that they might,
reap a profit on their refuse.
When yesterday's session of the com
mission got down to business, A. C. Ru
lofson nf Haker & Hamilton resumed his
testimony. He took another whack at
the exhibit presented by Mr. Waite of St.
Louis, showing by the figures presented
therein the wide difference between the
extreme Eastern and Western differen
tials in favor of the St. Louis jobber. He
showed that the Middle West wholesalers
were enabled by the favorable freight
rates and other conditions to extend their
trade 1700 miles Into fhe Western terri
tory, while the Pacific Coast merchants
were checked when they got 300 miles in
land from the Pacific Ocean. The Pa
cirlc Coast men, according to Mr. Rulof
scin, were doing business in their legiti
mate territory, which was being invaded
by the wholesalers of the Middle West
for a dumping place for their surplus
stocks. It was denied that the coast Job
bers have a combine on prices, but it was
demonstrated tthat the figures were al
most entirely controlled by the local and
Middle West competition.
Ocean the Factor in Freight Rates.
"St Louis is a big factor in fixing prices
here." said Mr. Rulofpon, "the came as
our ocean transportation Is the great fac
tor in regulating our freight rates. There
are still some merchants' on the coast
who do business on antediluvian meth
ods. They never figure the cost of th.Mr j
goods, but only look at the other fellow's
price and then shade it a bit."
The St. Louis contingent had no desire 1
to cross-examine Mr. Rulofson. In reply j
to the questions of the commission, he !
said that graded rates between the At- J
lantic and Pacific would obliterate the j
competition between the Illinois and New i
York manufacturers to the detriment of
the Western Jobbers and consumers.
J. P. Mather, general counsel of the
Chicago and Rock Island Railroad, took
a hand in the cross-examination. Refer
ring to the iron supply from Colorado, he
asked:
"Presuming that all modes of transpor
tation were' wiped out, would not the nat
ural supply of Iron for the Pacific Coast
be Colorado, for the reason that it is the
nearest point?"
"But we must not wipe out the ships,"
replied Rulofson. "Your Question is theo
retical, and I only feel called upon to re
ply to those bearing on actual conditions.
If the freight rates were graded the trade
from the wholesalers would go from the
manufacturers of the Middle West to
those of the Atlantic seaboard, where the
benefit of sea transportation could be se
cured. The competition which bothers us
most is that of the Middle West manufac
turer selling direct to the retailer, thus
eliminating the Jobber's profit entirely.
We certainly expect a reasonable differ-
I ential whether the rates arc graded or not.
The present conditions are as favorable to
the Middle West as could possibly, be ex
pected. If they are graded they would
be given an unnatural advantage which
would deprive. the coast of Its geographi
cal supremacy in the shape of its facilities
j for water transportation."
Need No Protective Tariff.
Chairman Knapp wanted to know If the
Pacific Ccast Jobbers desire the present
conditions to continue for the benefit of
the railroad company or as a protective
tariff to themselves. ! Mr. Rulofson replied
that the coast Jobbers asked for no pro
tective tariffâ they were willing to .meet
any competitors on equal terms. He said
that If rates were so arranged that the
coast Jobbers could handle their goods as
far east as the St. Louis men can west
the present hearing would not be In San
Francisco but would be nearer Denver.
Mr. Rulofson insisted that it was the
contents of the Pacific Coast people
that freight rates should be based entire
ly with reference to the means of trans
portation by water. Â¦:"â¢'-. - T
Henry Lefghtner of Waterhouse & Les
ter. Sacramento, and Edward D. Page,
Pacific Coast manager of the Howe Scale
Company, both stated that if the differ
entials were readjusted or a graded rate
was put into effect they would be forced
to ship all their goods by sea. .
Mr Page testified further that part of
his wares are now shipped by water and
a portion by rail. The greater part now
comes by rail en account of the existing
rates and all come by the carload figure.
His carload rate is Ji per hundred pounds
and the less than carload rate $1 50. mak
ing a differential of GO cents. If this were
lowered, he said, he would be compelled to
bring all his goods by water for the rea
son that it would bring him Into direct
competition with the Eastern and Middle
West dealer. If there were no water
transportation, In that event he would be
forced' out of business.
John Curtis of Payot, Upham & Co., W.
G. Houston of H. S. Crocker & Co. and
XV. S. Dixon, representing Cunningham,
Curtlss & Welch, presented the argument
of the stationery jind paper dealers, and
all agreed on the main points in dispute.
About 45 per cent of their goods come by
water. All that is clipped ovtrland comes
at the carload rate, and upon that figure
they base their prices, as do all the Paci
fic Coast dealers In commodities. The dif
ferential on their particular line of goods
is F5 cents. If this were reduced, they
agreed, they would have to seek cheaper
transportation. Already they have lost
the trade of much territory on account of
the encroachment of the Middle West Job
bers with the advantage of more favor
able freight rate conditions.
Charles F. Tay of the George H. Tay
Company was an excellent witness for thtÂ»
coast men.
Change WoulcT Disorganize Trade.
He testified that during 1592-93-94 50 per
cent of the goods purchased by his house
came by water. Now about 00 per cent of
his manufactured stock is purchased in
the Middle West- and is shipped by rail,
on which there is a differential of from
40 to 60 cents. He stated that if tbese
were readjusted the entire wholesale busi
ness of the coast in his line would be dis
arranged and consumers would not be
benefited a particle.
"Our prices are about the same now as
they are in the East," he said, "and I can
see no reason why the coast should be
made tributary to St. Louis, which would
be the outcome of readjustment. We can
compete with the Middle West men in
San Francisco, but the reduction of dif
ferentials would not enable us to hold our
own outside. I can cite a case where a
stove boiler was shipped to Reno. Nev.,
from Chicago at the 1. c. I. rate and the
freight was less than the c. I. rate to San
Francisco and local back. We could not
compete with that sort of business unless
we shipped the same class of goods
around the Horn."
Stubbs' Boomerang.
J. C. Stubbs of the Southern Pacific
Company suggested that it would not be
inconsistent for the jobbers of the Middle
West to reach Into this territory and sell
at very close margins in order to build up
new trade. The St. Louis people agreed
with him and found that they had run up
against a boomerang.
"Then," continued Mr. Stubbs, "if the
differentials give the coast Jobbers a
slight advantage is there any reason why
they should not employ It to reach out
Into remote districts and extend their
trade farther East?"
That part of the discussion ended right
there.
I. F. Llttlefield, representing "WTilttier,
Fuller & Co., gave testimony supporting
the line of defense of the Pacific Coast
Jobbera.
Attorney TV. F. Herrln announced that
he would consume this afternoon and
Thursday morning with his argument.
The St. Louis people will introduce about
half a dozen witnesses, and it Is expected
the hearing will be finished Friday.

as the openlac of the defense was sharp,

It was evident from thÂ» first shot that
the battle would be slow and confined to

Glories in His Lies.
A grÂ»at portion of tlie afternoon session
was forfuraed by the reading of news
paper clippings and having Bylva ac
knowledge or disavow statements given
to reporters. Contrary to the advice of
(loorpe Knight Sylva told some reporters
Mrangf tales, which were many miles
from the truth. He said to one that four
witnesses were concealed in his house
during the tirst interview with Mrs. Cra
ven-Fair. This he admitted yesterday
I was a fabrication, but sÂ»o eager was
j Sylva to end the litigation and save his
| friends the trouble of further annoyance
I at Ihe ham's of the petitioner that he did
! tr.'.s contrary to the advice of attorneys
! and out of his own deliberate Intention.
Afa.iri Joe Harvey was on the table of
consideration. It was ail for Joe, and at
no t'me was any other party given a mo
j ment'j thought, according to bylva's tes
' tlmonjr. Pence seemed to stow tired as
| thÂ»> day progressed and in the afternoon
i his Questions were weak in delivery and
!in naturr. Sylva 's career was the last
I eubject handled by the cross-examiner.
Eylva's Roaming Career.
TVhen Sylva had exhausted the fire anrj
energy of Lafe Pence in the serial story
of the meetings that took place in Sausa
lito. Pur.ands ctfice and latterly in the
ofiice of the Ponces, the attorney began
to interrogate the witness as to his life
IWore his Sauwilito residence. Sylva car
ried Pence through the great cities of
Europe, all over the Eastern part of this
country and gave him a liberal education
In migratorv life. Sylva Etarted his life
in New York and at the age of 6 went to
Berlin, where he attended school until
he wap quite a young man. Latin. Greek
and the sciences were his special studies.
He went to Cambridge, to Oxford, to
Vienna, to Rome. Here he met his fate
in the shape of a wife â the memory of
whom is still heavy with bitterness. Then
he came to this country â back to his na
tive city.
Being a musician, he applied for a posi
tion with a traveling show and was suc
cessful. From one citv to another in New-
York to Ohio he acted as leader of th*Â»
orchestra as well as manager. Finally
he came to California and settled here.
Sylva was not bo strong in the memory
of dates and incidents in regard to his
life. He would not commit himself, and
try a? he would. Pence could not elicit
any positive Information as to actual
dates. Sylva'a remaricable memory would
not trust itself .with facts further removed
in their occurrence than a very Tew years.
The ca?e will go on at 11 a. m. to-day,
Â¦when the cross-examination of the Sausa
lito trickster will be continued.

We have spent three months in the bush
and have collected a great mass of data,
which we will put Into shape for our re
port to be handed in to the President next
December. Nothing can be said on the
subject that would give the public a clear
Idea until this data nas been arranged and
is put into shape."
Admiral Walker was asked whether the
commission favored a fortified canal. He
replied that he could not enter Into thav
suoject.
"Our duty will be to state the facts and
to present to Congress the result of our
survey and work. Both routes have their
advantages and these will be set forth."
The admiral added: "Every where we

ONE OF KIM YUEY'S
KIDNAPERS ARRESTED
FAN JOSE, April 3.-The largest demon-,
etration In the history of this city was
held here to-r.iglit to condemn the out
rapt' perpetrated on Ml^s Cameron at
Palo Alto Friday Right by Justice Dyer,
Constables Harris and Dunsmore and At
torney Herrington and the spiriting away j
of the Chinese girl, Kirn Yuey. Three |
thousand people v.ere present and Turn j
Vereln Hall was packed to overflowing, j
Many were even unable to obtain stand- j
ing room. It was a most sensational
Gathering. Cclonel A. K. Whltton pre
elded and T. O. Smith acted as 6ecretary. [
On the stage were a number of the most I
prominent ladies ar.d gentlemen in this i
city and the vast audience was evenly {
divided between the sexes. A delegation j
cf eeveraJ hundred v.ere present from |
Stanford, about one-half of whom were
students, heeded by Professor Brun and
ethers of the faculty.
The sensational features were the
epeech by Attorney Herrlngton and the
production of Kirn Yuey. the kidnaped
firl. and v. ChinesÂ© pvrporUv.g to be her
usband. Ilerrlngton was greeted with
Jeors and hisses.
Kx-lioss Jim Rea broke In upon the
meeting and tried to turn It into political
fcigr.iticance. declaring the whole matter
a political move. He was hissed as he
retired.
J. H. Patton was the first speak-r. He
stated briefly the object of the meeting.
Miss Cameron, superintendent of the
Presbyterian Chinese Mission in San
Francisco, then related her adventures at
Palo Alto. Mr. Wclgle. counsel for M.ss
Â« ii.rr.eron, contirmed h*>r statements, rro-
lessor Brun mad* a t'lrrlr.p address.
Chairman Whltton then asked that any
one connected with the Palo Alto affair
come forward and make explanation.
Here an unlooked for sensats#n was
sprang. B. A. Herrington. ex-Dismct
Attorney, surged forward and mace an
Jmpass:6r.e<? eyfech. He said to every
question there were two sides, and asked
that judgment be reserved untM both
sid^s had been heard. As there were ru
mors of a public prosecution he would
only speai in a general way of the mat
ter. He refuted the arjr^aient that the
Chinese woman had abducted for
Immoral purposes. He claimed she was
forcibly taken to her home, and she was
row the wife of a prominent Chinese
xuerchant. On the promise from the au
clir.ee that the Chinese couple would not
c-Â»Â» molested they were produced upon the
ptage. A posse of officers accompanied
th.-m. As no interpreter was present they
were not questioned. Herrincton would
not answer many queries put to him and
was roundly hissed.
Judge Lewis followed. He scored Her
rir:jrton unmercifully and said no defense
irai presented. The following resolutions
Were then adopted:

City Justice O'Neal, when questioned in
rÂ«>:rtrd to the contract found on Wons
For. p. denied ar.y knowledge of It. He
said that on November 25. 1853. he and
Herrington entered into a contract with

a month, the period not to exceed one
year. When he became City Justice a

! Wong Fong Cleverly Trapped on the
Arrival of the Train From
San Jose.
Wong Fong, one of the two kidnapers of
the Chinese Â£lrl, Kirn Yuey, whose extra
ordinary treatment by Justice of the
Peace E. G. Dyer and others has aroused
such a strong feeling of Indignation
: among the residents of Palo Alto, was ar
' rested here yesterday morning and late In
: the afternoon was taken to Mayfleld,
Santa Clara County, to stand his trial.
Miss D. M. Cameron of the Chinese
Presbyterian Mission on Sacramento
' street, from whose custody the girl was
\ forcibly taken early last Friday morning
at l'alo Alto, received a telephone mes
sage yesterday morning from B. F. Hall,
druggist, Palo Alto, that one of the kid
napers had passed through on the train
Ito this city. She Immediately left the
j mission for Third and Townsend streets
;to await the arrival of the train. There
she met Policeman O'Connor and asked
his assistance in arresting the Mongolian.
; Two Chinese stepped off the train and
j both were placed under arrest by O'Con
' nor and taken to police headquarters.
; Miss Cameron had no hesitation in recog
nizing Wong Fong. The other Chinese
was set at liberty, as he proved conclu
sively that he had nothing to do with the
! kidnaping.
When Wong Fong was searched an un
j signed contract was found in his pockei
f which strengthened Miss Cameron's lden-
I titication. Wong Fong admitted to Chief
| Sullivan that he had brought the contract
i from San Jose to be signed by members
jof the Wong family. The contract reads
! as follows:
SAN JOSE. CaJ.. April 2. 1900.
IJ7Sâ AVe or either of us promise to pay B. A.
Harrington or order KO on the date hereof, $100
within ten days from the date hereof; also an
additional JI2J within thirty days from date
i hereof. We alsj agree to pay a reasonable
counsel f*e In the event of a suit to enforce
j the above payments. In consideration hereof.
and uj>on the flnal layinent of said sum, paid
R. A. Herrlngton agrees to cancel ami annul
and to return to the Wor.g family that certain
contract of f-mployment made upon the ZStb
j day of November, lii-9, by said Wong family
j with nald Ht-rrincton and Louis O'Neal; and
j said Herrir.Ktrn further agrees to use his best
abilities in all matters now pending In Panta
Clara County wherein any member of the Won*?
family is a party Interested â especially In the
cases of the People vs. Wong Goon. Wong
Quonir. Wong Hlng. Wong You, Wong Chee
and V'onz Fon^.
The importance of the discovery of the
contract lies In the fact that Miss Came
ron made a f=tatem*>nt that she felt con
vinced that ex-District Attorney Herring
ton was connected with the case when
Juftico of the Peace Dyer held court at
2 o'clock in the morning and handed over
the kidnaped girl to the two Chinese.
Wong Fong df~clined to make any state
ment in connection with his arrest. He is
I a shrewd Mongolian and seemed to know
a thing or two about law. He told Chief
Sullivan that h<> was an interpreter. The
Chief Font for Sergeant Mahoney of the
Chinatown sfjuad. and Mahoney knew him
at once. He was one of the four Chinese
rocommonded by the Chinese CÂ°nsul as
detectives to assist the police in suppress
ir.jr highbinders, which fact, taken in con-
Junction with recent developments, has
somewhat ptagpered the Chief. He re
marked thnt if that was the class of men
recommended to assist in the detection of
i crime he wanted none of them. He had
| been ser-n around thf City Prison fre
j QUently while the Chinese highbinders
I and murderers were there.
Chief Sullivan notified the Palo Alto
! authorities of Wong Fong's arrest, and
late yesterday afternoon Deputy Sherift
W. E. Brownell of Mayfteld arrived with
a warrant issued by Justice of the Peace
C Van Buren of that town and sworn to
by B. F. Hail, charging Wong Fong with
kidnaping. He was promptly handed over
to the custody of th* deputy s.hpriff, who
at once left with him for Mayfield.

Means Adopted by Mrs. Ed Danforth
to Cause Her Better Half to
Come Home Early.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, April 3.â Ed Danforth,
one year married, lies at his home on O
street suffering: from a bullet wound in
the leg. The other night Danforth stayed
out somewhat later than a newly married
man should and, although he telephoned
to a neighbor to tell his wife he would be
home soon, Mrs. Danforth deemed the
moment had arrived to assert her claims.
So she met her husband at the corner of
the block with revolver In hand and took
a shot at him.
Neighbors say that as Danforth limped
home he was hoard to plead to his wife
not to flro again. Mrs. Danforth agreed
to the armistice and to-day everything

RUSSIA AND JAPAN
NOT LIKELY TO WAR
Humors of Strained Relations Said to
Be Circulated in the Interest
of England.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, April 3.â There is a dis
position at the Russian Embassy to ac
cept with great reserve the report of pros
pective trouble between Russia and Japan
over Korea. Russian Embassador Casslni
informed me to-day that his communica
tion dlrectlv from Tokio respecting the
feeling in Japan Is entirely at variance
with that published In the press reports.
Russia .Is scrupulously observing the
terms '-of the agreement made with the
Japanese Government In relation to Korea
and has no Intention of precipitating war.
In other quarters there seems to be an
Impression that the reports In circulation
respecting prospective trouble between
Russia and Japan over Korea are Invented
by persons friendly to the English Gov
ernment for the purpose of distracting
general attention from South Africa.
Great Britain will naturally be benefited.
It Is said. If the world should concentrate
Its gaze upon the East rather than upon
South Africa.
So far as Japan Is concerned. It Is said,
she. Is not in a condition at this time to
go to war with Russia. With respect to
the assembling of the Japanese fleet at
Kobe, It Is reiterated that arrangements
for Its concentration were perfected
months ago and that there Is no warlike
purpose underlying the movement.

TRIED TO KILL ANOTHER
BUT SHOT HIMSELF
While Scuffling With His Intended
Victim, William Flood's Pistol
Is Discharged.
Special Dlsoatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, April 3.â William E.
Flood lies dead from the effects of a shot
which he intended for another. This after
noon he entered the Banquet cafe on*K
street, near Fourth, and insulted a dish
washer In the place named . William
Brauch. The latter resented the insult,
whereupon Flood drew a revolver and
shot Brauch through the thigh. In the
ecuffie which ensued Flood again dis
charged the weapon, but instead of the
shpt hitting his adversary It struck hlm
seTf. It was supposed that Flood had re
ceived only a scratch wound and he was
apparently in no pain as he walked to the
ambulance wagon. At the hospital, how
ever, it was discovered that he had been
shot In such a manner as to require an
operation. This was performed this even
ing and from its effects Flood died.
Brauch will recover.
Petaluma Fisherman Held.
PETALUMâ April 3.â Deputy Fish and
Game Commissioner Kelly of this city

Ghlo, a San Francisco fisherman, was ar
rested and charged with Illegal fishing.
He had stretched his nets entirely across
the creek at the Twin Houses, below this
city. When captured the fisherman had
a number of striped bass In his posses
sion. He was released on bonds in the
sum of $200.
DRUNKENNESS GIVEN AS
THE CAUSE OF INSANITY
Surgeon General Sternberg Accounts
for the Mental Derangement
of Soldiers.
tpeclal Dispatch tr> The Call.
WASHINGTON. ApriI 3.â "But two hun
dred and forty Insane soldiers, sailors and
marine hospital service employes have
been committed to the asylum since the
commencement of the war with Spain.
Not more than Fixty of these have come
from the Philippines."
This statement was made to-night by
Dr. A. B. Richardson, superintendent of
the Government Hospital for the insane.
"The cases from the Philippines have
arisen," he continued, "from heat exhaus
tion. Thore from Cuba "were due to at
tacks of fever. Most of the Philippine
patients have recovered and have been
discharged. There are now about 100 mili
tary* patients in the hospital."
Officials of the War and Navy depart-
ments say that the percentage of suicides
Is not very large when the number of
men who have'been in service since May
1, 180S, Is considered. It is further stated
that it is erroneous to say that the aver
age number of suicides is three each
week. Under date of March 12, General
Otis reported the suicide of an enlisted
man on February 22; another enlisted man
on March 6 and an officer on March 9.
This is said to be unusual.
Surgeon General Sternberg states that
much of the Insanity is due to alcoholism
and homesickness. In the enlistment of
such a large army, a great many persons
of an undesirable character were accept
ed and it is this class which has been
drinking to excess, notwithstanding the
warning of medical officers. Climatic
conditions also have acted adversely upon
memâm ore so, It is said, because of the
drunKenness which has occurred.

pavilion will so obstruct the view of the
adjoining American national pavilion that
Commissioner Peck has deemed it imper
ative to make another strong effort to
secure its removal. He has, therefore,
written a vigorously worded protest to
the director general of the exposition, in
which he says the Turkish pavilion will
seriously impair "not only our own build
ing, in which we take great pride, but
the effect of the vrhole embankment of
the Seine, on which are erected the pa
vilions of other nations."
Mr. Peck added: "I am satisfied you
have been led by pressure of matter upon
you to hastily sign an agreement which
permits so comparatively unimportant a
nation to seriously injure the building
of such a great nation as the United
States." 'ii _
The United States Embassador, General
Horace Porter, is seconding the Commis
sioner's efforts, and it is hoped that
such modifications of the Ottoman pavil
ion will be secured as to allow the Ameri
can building to be properly viewed from
the Pont dcs Invalldes and from the river
Regarding the Sunday opening question.
Commissioner Peck has received a peti
tion signed by a mass of American ex
hibitors in the engineering and machinery
section, which Is situated In the park of
Vlncennes, requesting permission to re
main open on Sundays, Sunday being the
omy day in the weeK on, which they ex
pect a large attendance, owing to the
park being out of the way for most of the
Parisians. They, therefore, wish to show
the machinery in motion that day. .
Commissioner Peck has decided to close
the national pavilion on Sunday.
Not Beady for the Opening.
Although it is less than a fortnight from
the date of the opening of the exposition,
the grounds are covered with fragments
of woodwork, stones and other rubbish,
and the authorities have alighted upon a
novel scavengering scheme. The Minis
ter of War Is to send 10.000 soldiers, who
are now being drilled for the purpose, to
sweep like an army through the grounds
and buildings on April 12, for the purposo
of clearing up all tne deDrls.
The state of unpreparedness of the ex
position was brought up in the Chamber
of Deputies this afternoon, when M. Gus
tav Chapuis, Radical Republican, intro
duced a resolution inviting the Govern
ment to postpone the opening. He said
that in view of the present state of the
works the inauguration on April 14 was
"simply a bait to draw provincials and
foreigners to see palaces which would not
be ready until a month later."
The Minister of Commerce, M. Miller
and, replied that the organizers had met
with all sorts of difficulties which had de
terred the progress of tne work. Never
theless, he added, no exposition had ever
been so ready as this one -at a similar
period. Continuing, M. Mlllerand said:
"I affirm that on the evening of the 13th
all the palaces will be ready and that the
majority of the exhibits also will be
ready. The inauguration has been de
creed for April 14, and France cannot
at this hour witndraw from its signed
engagements. The Invitations have been
sen', out and It would not be understood
why the exposition, which is ready,
should not be opened and on April 14."
M Mlllerand's statement elicited loud
applause from the Socialists and Radicals
and the resolution of M. Chapuls was re
jected by a vote of 557 to SS.
Sunday Closing Unlikely.
LONDON. April 3.â ln the House of
Lord to-day Lord Kinnaird asked the
Government to support the United States
in the closing of exhibits on Sunda.Â«s at
the Paris Exposition. The Premier. Lord
Salisbury, replied that the Government
was fully aware of the . feeling In the
matter, but had no shadow of authority
to deal with the subject. It was entirely
a question for the authorities of the ex
position. Their objection to shutting cer
tain shops on Sunday was that the gen
eral appearance ' of the exhibition would
thereby be seriously Injured and they did
not think themselves Justified In adopting
the suggestion. Opinions of the most di
verse character were entertained on the
subject, the Premier continued, but in
jfrance the opinions generally were not
precisely in accord with those of Lord
Kinnaird. The Government had done
what was possible In making representa
tions on the subject to the Exhibition
Commissioners.

BOISE, Idaho. April 3.â The story
told by Governor Steunenberj? to
the committee of the House of Rep
resentatives that Is investigating
the Coeur d'Alene riot respecting
a statement made by James R.
Sovereign to the effect that the
actual rioters were men acting
under the orders of Ed Boyce, pres
ident of the Western Federation of
Miners, and that these were put
under oath by him, is not new to
those having intimate knowledge of
the prosecution conducted by the
State of persons implicated in the
riots, but it had never before been
made public. Mr. Sovereign told
this same Btory very circumstan
tially to others, and it is somewhat
more sensational than represented
by the Governor.
According to Mr. Sovereign's
statement, Ed Boyce selected the
first twenty men and administered
to them the oath of a secret organi
zation known as the Red and White
Card of Anarchy. This organiza
tion is supposed to have its head
quarters in Chicago. The oath It
exacts from its memDers is some
thing terrible and is administered
amid surroundings intended to
deeply impress the minds of those
taking it. The oath Itself 13 taken,
according to Mr. Sovereign's state
ment, on a human skull claimed to
be that of some one who had be
longed to the organization who had
violated his oath and been killed by
avenging fellow members. The
statement made by Sovereign to
others than Mr. Cairfpbell was that
250 or thereabout were taken into
this' oath-bound combination. It is
a somewhat Interesting fact that a
number of persons who attempted
to count those of the mob who were
armed, and who were masked,
agreed that there were about 350.
Mr. Sovereign explained that,
while he was a loyal union man, he
was not an anarchist. He believed
that those anarchists should be
punished, but he held that the rank
and file of the unions were guiltless
and should not be prosecuted.
WASHINGTON, April 3.â Frederick
Burbriage, manager of the Bunker Hill
and Sullivan mine, was the chief witness
at the Coeur d'Alene investigation to-day.
It was the mill of this company which
was blown up in the uprising last April.
Brigadier General Carlin was to have
continued his testimony on the Insurrec
tion In 1592, but his official report of that
occurrence was accepted as sufficient and
he men gave way to Burbridge.
Burbridge took charge of the mine in
ISjZ. At that time the miners and labor
ers were paid $3 a day, as against J3 60,
the union scale. There were continual
threats to "clean out" the Bunker Hill
mine, but the troops brought there during
the Coxey army excitement had a calm
ing effect. After having been closed for
a time the Bunker Hill was started as a
strictly non-union mine. The union men
nad control of the approaches to the
Coeur d'Alene, and, with arms, frightened
away non-union men and "scabs." The
mine succeeded in manning its plant. In
ISMi, he said, dynamite was used against
the mine and lire did some damage to
tne mill. The mine was injured. Threats
continued, he said, up to the time of the
culmination of the agitation last April.
jne Miners' Union at Wardner met on
Sunday, April 23, a week before the ex
plosion, and sent a delegation to him,
Burbridge, to demand $3 50 a day ail
around.
Armed Mob Took Possession.
Afu-r fruitless conferences a strike was
ordered. The Bunker Hill employes were
stopped on the road by an- Armed mob;
revolvers were flourished amr the work
men were chased through the streets.
Later in the day an armed mob took pos
session of the tramway of the mine and
held it for a time.
Burbridge said he received frequent
warnings that he would be killed and the
mine blown up. Representative Sulzer
asked for the names of those giving the
warnings. Burbridge declined to give the
names, saying it would imperil the lives
of those who gave the warnings. The
Idaho courts had upheld him, he said, in
this refusal to divulge names.
Sulzer protested, but the committee, on
a vote, permitted the witness to proceed
without disclosing names.
* Burbridge told of the warning messages
received by him, of the arming of sOO
men, the putting on of masks and the de
tails of the march on the mill.
"Where are these messages?" asked
Sulzer.
"Blown up with the mill." replied the
witness.
Burbridge said he took such precautions
as were possible for the protection of the
mill and then, believing that he was an
eject of special attack, he left the mill
and did not see the explosion.
The witness said the presence of the
military was essential to the maintenance
of peace; the only objections to the mili
tary came from those who wished to
break the law.
Discharg-ed All Union Men.
Crosthwaite, of counsel for the State of
Idaho, directed the examination and was
followed by Attorney Robertson in cross
examination. This brought out that the
company discharged men when It was
learned they belonged to a union.
The witness said there was such a con
flict between union and non-union men
that the company took its side with the
non-union men, declining to employ mem
bers of the union.
Representative Stevens of Minnesota
asked if this was not a violation of the
law of Idaho, which provided that there
shall be no discrimination' against mem
bers of an organization. The witness said
he stated only the policy and facts in the
case, not the law. He conceded that the
non-employment of union men might
have embittered them.

WAR TAX REVISION.
CLOSFXY following the report of The Call's
special correspondent at Washington announ
cing the favorable attitude of the President
tOkViru a revision ot the war revenue act at thi? ses
,-ion conies the action of Congress on Monday call
ing upon the Secretary of the Treasury for estimates
toncerning the income likely to be derived from the
tax during the present fiscal year. The object of the
resolution is to obtain information upon which to
Inst proposals for revising the act, and its adoption
Miows that the House is inclined to take up the sub
ject at once. .
While the main intent of the purposed revision is to
reduce the war tax as far as is compatible with the
needs of the Government for revenue, an opportunity
will be afforded by it for eliminating from the act
those ambiguities of language which have enabled the
express companies to shirk their taxes and to treat
with contempt the decisions of the courts declaring
the plain intent of the law. The issue is one of the
most important* now before the country, for it in
volves the question of the power of the Government
tnd the courts to enforce a law which tax-shirking
corporations have determined to defy and to violate.
The members of the California delegation in Con
press, as well as a considerable number of Congress
men from other States, have given distinct pledges
that they will endeavor to so amend the law as to
compel the evasive corporations to pay the taxes im
posed upon them. The constituents of those Con
gressmen will expect them to take advantage of the
rrcpoted reduction of the tax to revise the act in ths
manner doired by the people. Wells, Fargo & Co.
have managed to shift their taxes upon the public
ever since the act went into effect. The decisions of
the courts against them have been of- no avail. It now
tcmsins for Congress to revise the law and make it
m> plain that the tax-shirkers will be compelled to
obey it. and so drastic in its penalties upon tax
shirking that those who attempt that form of robbing
the public will have occasion to regret it.

Chalker asserts, "the fact It not noted
by her own officers In the official report:
but that she did fire when going in was
believed by all of us naval officers, from
the bare fact that Captain Hodgsdon,
commanding the McCulloch. said shÂ© did.
and among naval officers the word of a
man of that standing Is not questioned
about a fact of which he has the most
positive, the best and sometimes the only
knowledge. And as, according to Mr.
Chalker, the McCulloch'a people did not
hear the Raleigh's gun, it ill becomes
them to insinuate that her captain makes
a false official statement."

one side, my testimony (that of the officer

WILL STAND BY THEIR COLORS.
SINXE persistent and cunningly devised efforts
are being made in some quarters to induce
conservative Democrats to support Bryan in the
coming election on the ground that the money ques
tion is no longer a vital issue, it is gratifying to note
that the stanch upholders of sound money in that
party are not going to be misled. The spirit of firn
ress has been particularly displayed in the Mississippi
Valley States, where the promoters of the Bryan
movement expected to find the greatest weakness.
A short time ago the gold Democrats of Indiana
held a meeting at Indianapolis, at which they adopted
resolutions reaffirming their unshaken adherence to
the sound money principles which thej\upheld in 1896.
In the course of their platform they declare: "All
that has been done and that is now being done by
those who supported Bryan in 1896 points to the re
adoption of the Chicago platform and the renomina
tion of Mr. Bryan. Being deeply impressed with the
gravity of the situation, we conceive it to be our sol
emn duty to oppose with all our strength the assaults
made by the Chicago platform of 1896 on individual
freedom, the right of private contract, the indepen
dence and integrity of the Federal judiciary, the au
thority of the President to enforce the laws and to de
nounce its advocacy of the radically wrong and fun
damentally dangerous demand for the free, unlimited
and independent coinage of silver and gold by the
United States at the ratio of 16 to 1, and its repudia
tion, at the instigation of Republican and Populist
allies, of the Democratic doctrine of tariff for revenue
only. There can be no compromise with those who
propose to support Mr. Bryan or any other candidate
on the Chicago platform."
Under the circumstances it would seem to be the
: plain policy of the conservative Democrats to support
! the Republican candidate, but that course does not
I attract the Indiana stalwarts. They stand by their
i principles of free trade and sound money and set pol
j icy aside. Their object is to provide for a ticket
lon the platform of Palmer and Buckner and to
I invite the co-o*peration of all gold Democrats in the
movement.
So far as the present campaign is concerned these
j supporters of genuine Democracy against Bryanism
! can hardly hope to effect much, but they are doubtless
j looking to the future. The Bryan movement, which was
at flood tide in 1896, is still strong enough to dominate
I the Democratic masses this year, but it is rapidly los-
I ing force, and the men who are reasserting the old
i Democratic doctrines will serve as a guard to rally
â¢ the scattered, hosts, after the November defeat, around
Â¦ the flag of the ancient faith.
To all appeals made to them by time-serving Demo
! crats they return the reply that there can be no com-
I promise between the conservatism of true Democracy
j and the rank radicalism of Bryanism. So long as the
j party name is borne by masses who follow such lead
j ers as Altgcld. Jones. George Fred Williams. Coi.i
j Harvey and others of the Bryan crowd, they will vote
1 against it. It is on their part a campaign of principle,
j and, however futile a third party may be in this con
1 test, no one can fail to respect the honesty of the men
who join such a party in maintenance of what they
; regard as right.

EXCLUDE JAPANESE COOLIES.
IT is amusing that, after The Call had stated the
case and developed all of the facts regarding the
invasion of this coast by Japanese coolies, the Ex
aminer professes to have discovered the matter and
is over, every day, the facts as we stated
them. There is nothing new to add to what The Call
disclose/1 as to the evil* or its remedy.
It is an international matter and can be adjusted
only by amending existing Japanese treaties or mak
ing a new one. All of the pages printed by the E\
aminer and defaced by its notions of art state noth
ing new. It is a matter for sober-minded and prompt
treatment. Its settlement is not possible in any other
way than The Call had pointed out before the Ex
aminer had thought of the matter. Its expletive and
sepsf.tional treatment by Hearst's twin papers cannot
.-.dvar.ee but rather may retard a proper adjustment
by treaty.
It is noteworthy that every step forward toward the
exclusion of Chine.se coolie labor was taken by those
whom the Examiner opposed and abused. That paper
thinks that the way to do things is by bucking up
against a post and yelling like a drunken hoodlum. Its
frantic screaming on this Japanese question now is
done to divert public attention from Jts recent per
formanceto advertise the^cxistence of bubonic plague
in San Francisco.

THE MERCHANT MARINE BILL.
GENERAL GROSVENOR, chairman of the
House Committee on Merchant Marine and
Fisheries, in presenting the amended shipping
bill on Saturday, pointed out briefly the need of an
increased shipping to carry on our increasing com
merce, and said:
"It will, of course, take a considerable time to reach
the desired end, but the sooner the policy is entered
t'pon the sooner and easier will be its accomplishment.
The means proposed are open to the capital, the en
terprise and the skill of our citizens alike and on equal
terms. There is no ground for the form of monopoly.
There is absolute safety to the treasury in the fact
that no payment can be made until in each and fcr
each voyage the work is actually performed. As we
have before stated, it is certain that no vessel, 'great
or small, fast or slow, in the list can afford to make
a single voyage without also having a large commer
cial business income from the same voyage, and in
doing which commercial business she is fulfilling the
great purpose of the bill."
' Whether the amended bill, safeguarded in the man
ner stated by Grosvenor, will have the effect of
silencing the inveterate opponents of American com
merce may be doubted, but it will at least have the
effect of compelling them to shift their ground and
take up a new position of attack. The clamor raised
against the original measure was based almost wholly
upon the assertion that it was devised in the interest of
a few large corporations. That assertion cannot with
even a show of truth be made against the new bill.
Against attack from that quarter it is impregnable.
Of course, some other means of fighting the meas
ure will be devised. There are large and powerful
interests backing the ocean lines of other nations, and
they will do all that is within the scope of their re
sources to prevent the upbuilding of an American
merchant marine to compete with those lines. It is
estimated the American people pay $200,000,000 an
nually to- foreigners for the ocean transportation of
Am^Vican commerce, and the profits derived from
that vast expenditure are too large to be surrendered
without a struggle. The fight, therefore, will go on,
but the prospects of victory for American commerce
are brighter than ever before. In fact, there are now
good reasons for expecting the passage of the bill
at this session, and should it be so. the Republican
party can go before the people in the campaign this
fall with the record of having fulfilled every pledge
of the 'platform on which McKinley was elected in
1896.

the reports of operations subsequent to

Puget Sound Naval Station,
BREMERTON, Wash., March 29, 1900.
TO the Kdltor of The Call: In your Is
sue of March 26 appears a letter from
J. H. Chalker. chief engineer. IT. S.
R. M., now serving on board the cut
ter McCulloch, which, as you say. takes
issue with me on the fact of.the Raleigh
having fired the first gun at Manila. Mr.
Chalker quotes from the reports of Ad
miral Dewey and Captain Gridley. saying
that the Boston and McCulloch fired at
El Fralle, and not 'mentioning the Ral
eigh. He. however, falls to quote from my
own report to the admiral or from the re
port of Commander Wood of the Petrel,
the vessel next astern and on the Ral
eigh's quarter. WHICH REPORTS ARE
FOUND IN THE S..ME BOOK AS THE
OTHERS FROM WHICH HE DOES
QUOTE, and in which the Raleigh IS
mentioned as follows: Commander Wood
says: "The position of the Petrel was
fourth from the head of column, astern of
the Raleigh and ahead of the Concord.
We passed In through Boca Grande, about
one mile from El Fralle â¢ â¢ â¢ at 11:10.
a rocket and light were shown from Cor
regidor Island and just as the Raleigh and
Petrel came abreast of El Fralle three
shots were fired from a shore battery on
the rock, these being promptly replied to
by the Raleigh, Concord and Boston."
Now arguing from the stand and quota
tions of Mr. Chalker, the Concord did not
tire at El Fralle, because neither the ad
miral nor Captain Grldley mention It, and
yet Commander Wood mentions her firing.
I saw and heard her firing and her execu
tive reports her having fired, and both the
Raleigh and the Concord fired for some
time before the Boston did. This Is not
a supposition nor is it based on arguments
âIt is a simple fact. The fact that the
McCulloch fired at the same time as the
Boston, as stated by Mr. Chalker, proves
conclusively that she did not fire the first
gun, as the Boston did not firo until after
the Raleigh had fired and passed and the
Concord had afterward fired and passed.
This is not hearsay, but absolute knowl
edge on my part. By the deck clock of
the Raleigh she fired her gun at 12:10
a. m., but next day, finding our clock was
different from that of the Olympla, in my
report I put the time of our shot at 12:15
a. m., so as to try to have all the times
correspond as nearly as possible with that
noted on the flagship. No two deck
clocks on board the same ship ever corre
spond for any length of time, as they are
cheap at best.
Referring to Lieutenant Rodman having
destroyed the batteries on Corregidor,
etc.. as I wrote you, I have to state again
that that is the actual fact. My report
to Admiral Dewey shows that on May 3,
IS9S, we destroyed about four and a half
tons of ammunition for those different
batteries, got the breech plugs of eight
big guns, cut the breechir.gs, broke some
manipulating gear, split the recoil cylind
ers and carried away and threw over
board about a ton of other manipulating
gear, and rendered all the batteries guard
ing the entrance to the bay unserviceable.
That, in military parlance, is destroying
the batteries. When we got through with
them they were in a condition of "innoc
uous desuetude." Seven of the eight breech
plugs taken that day (May 3. 1895.) when
the batteries were destroyed were brought
to the United States in the Raleigh; the
eighth one, a 4.7-inch, was given to the
Manila when we armed her, and is now
in use on that vessel in one of the guns
taken from one of the destroyed ships.
Some months after we had put the bat
teries hors de combat it was reported to
the admiral that Aguinaldo"s people had
carried off one of the wrecked guns orr
El Fraile Rock. As it was thought that
some of his people, who had been sailors
In the destroyed Spanish fleet, might
know the whereabouts of the breech-plugs
of the same size guns of the destroyed
vessels, most of which plugs had been re
moved as the ships were abandoned, and
might be able to fit them to the guns
from El Fraile. the Manadnock and the
McCulloch were sent down to haul the
guns overboard if possible, blow them up
or get them fnto deep water, so that not
even the carcasses would be left to be
taken to the mainland and repaired. This,
Former Commander of the Cruiser Raleigh Quotes From
Reports That the Revenue Marine Officer Seems
to Have Overlooked.
EXPANSION ISSUE JOINED
WE have already quoted Mr. Howell of the At
lanta Constitution as to the Democratic posi
tion on .expansion. Immediately' comes an
other statement from Senator Jones of Arkansas,
chairman of the Democratic National Committee,
who says: "1 believe when we ratified the treaty
Porto Rico and the* Philippines became a part of the
United States, and that the constitution immediately
extended over these new possessions by its own force,
and that the people of those islands are entitled to
the blessings and immunities which that instrument
gives to our own people." At last the Democratic
policy is made plain. It is that these islands are under
the constitution, and that their people are citizens of
the United States, members of our body politic, free
to come and go. and electors, with the ballot in hand
in any State of this Union, when they have fulfilled
the residence qualification of its laws.
Further than this: It was settled in our Civil War
that territory once under the Federal constitution is
thereafter inalienable. Neither by the revolutionary
act of its own people, nor by consent of the Federal
Government, can it cease to be a part of the Ameri
can Union. Therefore if Mr. Howell and the chair
man of the Democratic National Committee are right,
there can be no anti-expansion issue in this campaign,
nor in any other. AH that the treaty of Paris brought
to us is now a constitutional part of the republic, and
must remain Â«o. world without end. It will be seen,
then, that the Democratic party offers no refuge to
the anti-expansion sentiment of the country. Indeed,
from the standpoint of Senator Jones, anti-expansion
immediately takes its place alongside of secession,
since it becomes a proposition to divide the Union,
and raises every question that the sword settled, in the
Civil War.
Turning from this to the Republican position, the
difference is clear cut and plain. The Republican con
tention is that, unlike the Louisiana. Florida . and
Mexican treaties for the acquisition of inhabited ter
ritory, the treaty of Paris does not extend citizenship
to such of that population as choose to accept it. but
leaves their civil and political status to be settled by
Congress. These new possessions, therefore, are not
brought under the constitution, nor are their people
members of our body politic. Their territory is held
as propert3 r of the United States, of which this Gov
ernment can dispose as it seems fit. It may give to
the inhabitants independence, and protect them in the
formation and administration of self-government, or
not, as it chooses. The Democratic position abso
lutely concludes and forecloses the whole issue, makes
the situation irrevocable and unchangeable, and leads
to almost immediate statehood to Porto Rico and the
Philippines. The Republican position holds the issue
open, subject to the riper experience and sounder
judgment of the people.
There is a large element in the country opposed to
expansion. It desires to reason with the country on
the subject and to deal with the sober second thought
of the people. Its only chance to do so lies in sup
port of the Republican position. That party refuses
to foreclose the issue. It refuses to conclude a ques
tion which is not ready for decision. It proposes the
best possible executive administration of these new
possessions, as Jefferson administered Louisiana and
Jackson governed Florida under Monroe, until the
public mind is made up and a policy ripens out of dis
cussion. Ask the volunteers who stood the first brunt
of the fighting in the Philippines if they want the
Filipinos as fellow citizens, and their practically
unanimous decision is against it.
There are precedents enough to justify the Repub
lican position, and expediency demands its support by
every anti-expansionist.
The situation is clearing. Colonel Bryan will soon
be in California. Let us hear whether he indorses
Chairman Jones* contention that we have taken into
our body politic about twelve millions of people, of
mixed and alien races, who are entitled now to all "the
blessings and immunities" of American citizenship.

OUR FRUIT AT PARIS.
1â;1 â ; ROM the Washington correspondent of the
I New York Sun it is learned that the officers' of
Â¦ the division of pomology of the Department
of Agriculture purpose to make a vigorous effort at
the Paris Exposition to widen the European demand
for American fruit. To that end particular care will
be taken to convert the Germans. The writer says:
"All the leading German horticulturists have been
invited to, make a special examination of the Ameri
can exhibit. The Germans have barred out our ap
ples, and even our dried fruits, on the ground that the
San Jose scale, which is very destructive of orchards,
would be carried into they- country on the fruit.
Leading scientists of this country, and of Germany
r.lso, have proved several times by experiments that
this cannot be the case. Still our fruit is kept out of
Germany. The department officials are confident that
the great battle between science and prejudice will be
fought- out successfully at Paris this summer."
The largest single exhibit will be that of the appb
i'ldrstry. It is said to be the finest ever made by the
United States, and includes about 2500 barrels, rep
resenting the orchards of the entire country. As the
exhibit was a volunteer one, some States have very
large collections, and otlicrs. while sending smaller
exhibits, are thoroughly represented. California has
250 barrels, and Missouri sends from her magnificent
orchards in the Ozark Mountains about two hundred
bairels. There arc large- exhibits from Michigan,
Illinois, New York. Indiana, Pennsylvania and North
Carolina. Virginia, Connecticut and West Virginia
are represented by very choice examples of a great
number of varieties, although the aggregate in each
is not large. New' York sends 200 bushel boxes,
showing the standard line of best keeping winter
apples.;^:;.
While the exhibits made by Eastern orchards nat
urally have most prominence in the article of the
Sun. the splendid work done in California is not
overlooked. The writer says: "One of the finest fea
tures of the horticultural exhibit will be furnished by
the Californians, whose Legislature appropriated $70. -
000 for the purpose. They intend to send all during
the fruit season this coming summer, fortnightly,
specimens in refrigerator cars. and the refrigerator
compartments of the ocean steamers, of pears, plums
and peaches. They will also send grapes as soon as
the new crop comes in."
There arc good reasons for -believing the effons
made by the Agricultural Department to break down
the barriers of prejudice against American fruit will
be successful. In fact, the strong opposition which
has been made by a powerful section of the German
people to the meat bill is an evidence that the agra
rians, who have sought to exclude all sorts of Ameri
can farm products from Germany, are by no means
so dominant in the empire as they were a few years
ago. With such an object lesson as our fruit-growers
can present to the world at Paris, it seems probable
the last vestige of prejudice will be overcome. In the
efforts of the Government officials to accomplish that
result California will cordiallyco-operate.

10 j-en.
Inouye testified before the special board
of inquiry that it usually requires from
six months to a year for a Japanese emi
grant to obtain from his Government the
necessary passport permitting him to
leave the country, but that by becoming
a member of the Kumamoto Emigration
Company and paying the 10 yen he re
ceived his passport within a few days
after the date of his application. He was
not acquainted with his guarantors, they
having been furnished by the company.
Commissioner North notified Commis
sioner Powderly that the contract used
by the company was drawn ln this city
by the law firm of Webb & Espey and
that Inouye was put forward to make a
test case. "If It should succeed the coun
try would be flooded with Japanese con
tract laborers within a few years," he
added.

RAILWAY COMPANY IS
CENSURED BY A JURY
A Coroner's jury In the case of Alphonse
Zuckerman censured the Market-street
Railway Company yesterday for his death.
Zuckerman and several friends tried to
board a Hayes-street car last Saturday
evening. He caught hold of one of the
stanchions on the dummy, but on account
of the- car being overcrowded he missed
his hold and fell into the street, where he
was run over by a wagon of the Alameda
Transfer Company.
The grlpman. J. D. McConnell, dented
that the deceased got on the car at all.
Neither he nor the conductor would admit
that the car was ever overcrowded. The
jury was unable to fix the responsibility
for the death of the deceased, but said:
"We .recommend that- the Market-street
car system be censured for the dangerous
way in which it allows its' cars to bÂ« over
crowded."

The Arabs, says Humboldt. must be re

Avicenna. born 9V>. wrote on many Â«<ci
< ences. but was known in Europe only aa
; a doctor. His canons or. rules, in fivÂ«Â»
books, served for centuries as the basis of
medical studies in France ar.d Italy. The

Caravans came from Arabia with the
spices and iiicense of Yemen, the druirs
and pearls of Hadramant. which were
brought into the markets of Europe. Tht

From them came the first learned pre
scriptions.
Dante himself was registered on the
books of Florence among the pharmacists
and so was probably well acquainted with
this branch of Arabian science. Astron
omy and astrology find numerous allu
sions in his pages. That famous passage
uttered by Pluto in the seventh canto,
which most commentators havf supposed
to he Hebrew, is in all probability Arabic
It is on the face of it more likely that the
poet should put into the mouth of one of
the princes of the infernal world an ut
terance in the language of the great ene
mies of Christendom than words in the
Hebrew, which, according to common be
lief, was the sacred mother of all.
I have thus mentioned some of the chief
literary elements which combine in the
"Divine Comedy."' The same may be
done for several other?, such as the poli
tics of Florence and Italy, the religion,
art and science of the middle ages, so that
the "Divine Comedy" may justly be called
the medieval epic. What makes It. how
ever, a work of consummate art is in
this, that these diverse elements are
given not as simple facts of knowledge,
but. like the chemical constituents of the
living tree or flower, they all form an in
tegral part of one body of culture, which
is the soul life of the great poet himself.
I have compared Dante to Homer, but |
he differs from Homer by all the differ
ence of the romantic and the classical
ideals, in art. Homer brought the gods
down to earth and made them men. Dante
takes men into the spiritual world and so
connects them with the infinite.
Classic art is clear and well defined. Its
most characteristic form was sculpture.
It sprang from a simple and natural civ- !
ilizatlon. not overshadowed by a dread of
the future coloring all its thoughts and
movements with a sense of the Invisible. |
The Greeks were children of the present, i
filled with the enthusiasm of actual en
joyment, and so their art attained the
most exquisite perfection of material
form. During the middle ages, on the
other. hand, devotion and theolrtpry had!
their eyes turned toward heaven. Earth
was considered not as a place of enjoy

sepulcher of Christ from the Infidel would
bring salvation to the soul. Hermits went

Two big fleets reached their destina
tions yesterday. One came in through
the Golden Gate while the other arrived
at English ports. The one, that came
here was composed of vessels from
Europe, Hawaii and Central America,
while the English fleet was composed of
grain-laden vessels from Pacific Coast
ports.
Amons those that came to an anchor
in the bay yesterday were the British
ship Primrose Hill. 135 days from Liver
pool: British ship Bardowle. 160 days from
i-ondon; Hawaiian bark Santiago. 17
days; schooner Aloha, IS days, and bark
Mayuna Ala, 28 days from Honolulu;
schooner A. M. Baxter, 2) days from Hilo,
and schooner Charles Hanson, 47 days
from San Bias.
The Bardowie and Primrose Hill had
some heavy weather off the Horn. Dur
ing a tempest E. Enbritsen, a sailor on
the Bardowie, was vashed overboard and
drowned. The ship was unc!er short can
vas and plunging into a heavy head sea
so little cuuld be done toward saving the
unfortunate man. After some perilous
work the ship was hove to and a boat
lowered, but not a trace of Enbritsen
could be found. It was freezing weather
nt tho f Imp and the. sailor was dressed
in heavy clothing, so the chances are he
went down almost without a struggle.
There were sixteen vessels from the Pa
cific Coast that reached Falmouth and
Queenstojvn yesterday. Eleven of the fleet
reached the lattf-r port, so California and
Oregon wheat will be well represented
when Queen Victoria visits the bay in her
yacht, the Albert and Victoria, to-day.
The tieet was composed of the J. ; G.
Glad<Â» that sailed from this coast on
October 14: Falrport, October 17; Drum
blair, November 1; General de CharPtte
and Dimsdale, November 2; St. Memgo,
November 8; Castle Rock. November 9;
McMahon and Port Patrick. November
!0; Saint Anne and Forfarshire, Novem
ber 15: Valkyre, November 17: Invercauld
and Duchalburn, November 25. Royal
Forth, December 3. and Silberhorn. De
cember 5. The value of the cargoes of
this fleet is in the neighborhood of
$2.0" iO, 000.
It will be noticed that there was just
fifty-two days between thf- sailing or" thÂ»
German bark J. G. Glade and the British
shir Silbtrhorn from this port for v'ork.
The latter vessel goes under the German
flag, as does also the Royal Forth and
Dochalburn. All three vessels were r.oUl
to Hamburg parties last month.
Strange to say. the French bark Snint
Anne was reinsured to the extent of, T>
pc:- corn. She was spoken off the Horn
about Christmas time making very heavy
weather in a pale, and that was* th*Â» on!y
thing on which to base an excuse for re
insurance.
Chief Wharfinger Percy Henderson was
a very disappointed man when he heard
of the arrival of the Saint Anne. He had
formed a pool of $1000 with which to play
the overdue and just as he was ready to
place the money the news came of her
arrival. ,
J. C Johnson, a sweeper, was treated
at the Harbor Hospital yesterday for a
fracture of the Wt leg and lacerations
of the forehead, cheek? and hands. While
at work on the corner of Drumm and
Sacramento streets a sausage wagon,
driven by Sam Kfper. ran into him and
knocked him down. The injured man was
taken to the hospital, while the sausajje
man was taken to the Harbor police sta
tion.
The naval reserve training ship Marlon
will not come down from Mare Island
until the Sunday after Easter. The men
will go up to the navy yard and bring the
old sloop-of-war down, after which there
will be a jubilation aboard.
The fact that sailors are scarce was ex
emplified in the sailing of the codfishing
fleet ypsterday. A fe%v old timers were
secured, hut in nearly every instance the
majority of the crews were green hands.
The schooners Stanley. Mary and Ida anJ
the barkentine Frtmor.t all sailed for the
codfishing banks 3'esterday.

GOLDEN AGE OF ITALIAN LITERATURE.

GOLDEN AGES OF LITERATURE.
XII. DANTE AND HIS RELATION
TO MODERN LITERATURE.
(Concluded.)
BT C. W. BENTON. PH.D.
Another of the principal elements of
culture came from the Arabs. It Is now
recognized that scholastic philosophy was
taken in great measure from their writ
ings. They form the link in the chain
which connects ancient philosophy to
scholastics. The works of Aristotle, as
commented by the Arabian philosophers,
were translated into Latin and may be
eaid to have contributed much to awaken
the desire and the thirst for the original
Greek sources, and thus prepared the way
for the renaissance.
Front the Caliph Almamonn Honain re
ceived a weight of gold equal to each of
the Greek books he translated into Ara
bic. From the ninth century to the mid
dle of the eleventh the Arabs were mas
ters of Sicily, and even under the Em
peror Frederick 111, in the thirteenth,
they still held the peninsula under their
intellectual sway. Although Europe hated
mem mr being Mohammedans, it was fas
cinated by their superior civilization, their
rich fabrics, their ornaments of jewelry,
their finely tempered blades of Damascus
and Toledo, their elegant architecture,
which, as Lamenais says, with its arches
and wonderful tracery of stone, resembles
some brilliant dream, where the eye Is
lost in the pursuit of a symmetry which
at every moment it hopes to seize, but
which escapes it ever.
Many of the scholars of Europe flocked
to the Arabian universities and brought
back numerous sciences and inventions.
The first clock known in Europe was sent
to Charlemagne by Haroun al Raschid.
Roger Bacon brought back chemistry.
Gerbert the Arabic numerals. About 1200
Leonardo of Pisa composed a treatise on
algebra which he had learned among the
Arabs. In the thirteenth century Cam
panus of Navarre translated and com-
ties of hell and secure the mansions that
fade not away.
It was the duty of the strong: to protect
the weak and oppressed. The institution
of chivalry arose, which combined, the
love of woman with the adoration of the
virgin mother of God. Ideal womanhood
was made the Intermediate of the divine.
This spiritual worship of woman Is very
different from that which existed ln
Greece and gives rise to a different idea!
in art. In Greek art the perfect woman
Is the form of the Venus de Mllo. With
Dante. Beatrice la something more than
a perfect form. Herself he does not even
describe. She !s ln the inner sanctuary and
the whole poem is filled with her very
presence. Absent from view, hersplrit per
vades and floats over the whole work,
beckoning: on to loftier and more spiritual
scenes. Even when she was alive and ap
peared to him on the streets of Florence
there was such a sense of charity filled his
soul that he could pardon all his enemies.
When she died the earth wa3 desolate
and the tomb becomes the corner-3tor.e of
the Christian's sons:. As his love in its
strength is revealed to him by the death
of Beatrice, death has no power ov<?r it.
and to his faith she becomes In truth im
mortal after she was dead. She had ap
peared as a messenger but for a time to
bring to earth a revelation of the divine
and the eternal. This ideal was the pas
sion of Italy in the middle ages, the wor
ship of the Madonna.
In a similar manner Raphael transfig
ures the face of her whom he loved into
that of the Sistlne Madonna. Italy failed
to secure the dominion of the world to
which she aspired in the restoration of the
Roman empire, but through her faith in
this exalteii ideal she did gain supremacy
in the world of art
It is this ardent personality of the poet
which give? Its chief interest tr> the
"Divine Comedy." In classic art the indi
vidual was forgotten ln the general. In
romantic art the sense of personal worth
so prevails and overflows as to give color
and character to the smallest details. Per
fection of form is often sacrificed to en
ergy of soul. In classic art humanity wa?
typified in the perfection of the godlike.

The gods themselves were made men, and
the point of contact where both met was
the very highest culmination and only
possible expression of perfect art. In ro
mantic art that typical and ideal form
was no longer enough to express the Indi
vidual aspirations ol immortal hope which
the cold marble could no longer contain.
The new life of the imprisoned soul must
pierce into the realm of spirit where Is its
veritable home. This struggle for freedom
will vary according to the character of
the Individual. This explains the infinite
variety of romantic art. A consciousness
that the perfect cannot be attained will
produce that sense of the infinite mingled
with sadne.=s which Is thÂ» mark of modern
poetry. The sense nf victory over difficul
ties, on the other hand, will eive that
buoyancy of hone that the future may
reveal. ThÂ» uniformit* of classic art has
given place to the variety of individual
taste. All objects become interesting whÂ»n
touched with human emotion. The objects
of art become multiform as nature. Na
ture Dante calls the daughter of the in
finite mind. and. as art Is the truthful
reproduction of the daughter of nature. .so
art he deHnes as the grandchild, of Deity.
This lineage of art explains the religious
fervor of the art of Italy. It becomes the
highest good, and the word which ex
presses the highest excellence of charac
ter is taken to designate the virtuoso, the
skilled interpreter of art. The manger be
comes sacred because in it was rocked thÂ«
infant King. To it come the wise men of
the east nifh their gifts of franhinceuse
and. gold. The genius of Christian art
portrays the lowliest of scenes. The fish
ermen of Galilee become heroes for thÂ»
painter's brush. The lilies of the field are
more radiant than Solomon ln all his
glory. Every object ln nature becomes
interesting because touched by an immor
tal hand. Each blade of gra^s. each stone
is precious bocause it brings to the eye thÂ«Â»
light of a distant star. This glow oZ
sympathy Dante gives to the commonest
thing?. When he speaks of looking at
some object In the realm of shades it la
with the Intent look of a shoemaker try
ing to thread his needle after the twilight
has gathered.- When the spirits come
around him in paradise it is as when gold
fishes in an ariuarium Rock around a,
crumb of bread. The music of the sky
lark is made real when he stops for a mo
ment as if satisfied with his last note.
Evening ii> the time when the mariner's
thought turns fondly toward those whom
he left at home or when the pilgrim's eyes
turn heavenward on hearing the distant
bell weeping: for departing day. When
the plant Antaeus stooped to lift tho
travelers over one of the subterranean,
chasms he iw likened to the leaning tower
of Oarisenda at BÂ«lo?na when a cloud has
gathered upon it. There Is scarcely a city
in Italy which does not retain reminis
cences of him. He used to sit on that
stone to look at the cathedral. Along that
path outside the city he used to walk in
deep thought during hts exile.
Florence has done all she could to atone
for her lrisrratitude to h*r greatest citizen.
She has erected monuments in his honor,
and In the church of Santa Croce a ceno
taph near the tombs of Michael Arcetrt
and Galileo, but Ravenna, where he died,
refuses to surrender his ashes.
v Thl<Â» power of mlnsrllnsr human feeHns'
with the ordinary scpnes of nature and nÂ£
life, possessed In a suorrme d^srri?* by
Dante, ha* become one of the chief feat
ures of modern literature, the pift of find

NEW YORK. April 3â The two most' potent

pressure to liquidate the former had a de

lent to abandonment Ot further dividend dis
trlbatfcma this year owing to legal cbstacles.
Tl.e Ftrt-ngth in Baltimore and Ohio developed
aSt'^r the executive committee had convened.
It was generally understood that this meeting
would consider the- granting of additional
right* to stockholders. A nÂ«?w rumor found
circulation atxjut every five minutes as to what
the richt wuuld t>e. and the speculation in the
etocks of the company was very active. The
common stock touched fcv-, and the preferred
Â£5, and both reacted nearly 2 points on proflt
utking. helping to the easier tone in the close.
London was a free seller in the early dealings
and heljxM to the opening reaction. While
there w*-re no very large offerings brought out
at the de-'!ine the demand for stocks was de
cidedly lens urgent than In the recent mar
ket and when the dullness and firmness
prompted to an advance large offerings to
realize were brought out when prices got back
to last night's level. The market gave evidence
of the pressure r.f large speculative holdings
to .realize, but holders evidently fe!t them
â¢-lves strong enough to withhold their offerings
at any cor.."idf-rable concession. Outside a few
stocks to-day's movement in prices was nar
row. There was considerable strength In the
grangers under the leadership of St. Paul,
l/ased t>n a vrry heavy grain movement now
polng over the Western lines. The trunk lines
were firm on the large east-bound shipments
l*Â»sldep the sympathetic effect of the movement
of Baltimore and < iliio stocks. The rally from
the low point reached In a number of prom
inent railroads, but finally eased off. leaving
most of the day's changes small and mixed I

NEW YORK. April 3.â Commercial Adver
tiser's London financial cablegram says:
There was considerable reduction in business
here to-day on account of the approach of
Easter. The_ most pronounced activity was in
Americans, which, however, sagged all day,
and in them a smaller volume of business was
done than for some time. Most transactions
were rrulit-laklng. New York bought only St.
Paul, and the decline continued until in the
street, where there was a sudden strone re
vival on New York orders for Baltimore and
Ohio and Atchison.
Paris sold its favorites, it being pay day.
Tintos were over 59 and closed at 5S?i. London
bought Anaconda largely, up to . 11%. New
York's free profit-taking caused a relapse to
ll'i- The bank lost Â£6000 gold to South Amer
ica. Â£20.000 to Rcumania and Â£10,000 to an
unstated destination. Bars to the amount of
Â£12.000 were bought. The large amount of
money due the bank was wholly paid. New
York sold silver, but Indian buying was re
vived.

COFFEF VS. PREACHER.
"People Poisoned, by Coffee Should
Leavxj It Off."
"I have been a great coffee drinker
for years and it has kept me in a bilious
condttion. with more or less neuralgia,
as the result of general ill-health pro-
duced by coffee drinking. I have dis-
covered that coffee is a rank poison to
n-y system. Since we have been using
Postnm Cereal Food Coffee we not
only nnd it a delightful beverage, with
all the good qualities of coffee, but it
has none of the injurious effects.
"Any person suffering from nervous
troubles, caused by the poison of cof-
fee, should be nble to get rid of the
tickness in short order if such a one
will leave off the cause and take up
I'ostutn Food Coffee. There has been
no coffee used in our home for a con-
siderable time.
"People who are poisoned by coffee
should leave it off. because when or.c
Â¦j" 5 against his body he dishonors Goj,
'for our bodies are the temples of the

one conscious of the bodily distress that
coffee brings would have no trouble in

fee can be secured." Rev. John M

RAILROAD EMPLOYES
AGAINST RELIEF PLAN
Grievance Committee Resolves to
Make an Unqualified Stand.
Conference Fixed.
Representatives of the grievance com
mittee of railroad brotherhoods met with
Collis P. Huntington, president of the
Southern Pacific Company, yesterday and
fixed upon Thursday, at 2 o'clock, as the
time for the committees to hold a con
ference with the head of the Southern
Pacific system and make formal complaint
against the relief plan which it is sought
to foist uv>on them.
Yesterday morning there was a Joint
meeting of the 112 delegates representing
the Conductors', Firemen's, Engineers',
Trainmen's, Telegraphers' and Machinists'
brotherhoods. The gathering took place
at 320 Post street, and both morning and
afternoon sessions were held. The em
ployes of the Southern Pacific who partici
pated are sworn to secrecy, but it is un
derstood that they have prepared a state
ment setting forth the reasons why they
do not wish to accept the so-called relief
plan, and have named able men to pre
sent It to Huntington. It is said to be the
unanimous decision of the committees, in
Joint session, that an unqualified request
be made to President Huntington to
abandon the proposed relief plan, on thÂ«
ground that it is unjust and will tend to
destroy the efficiency of labor organiza
tions.
While the grievance will be presented as
a "request," there is behind it a veiled
demand, and if the "request" is denied it
is likely that Ferious trouble will follow.
The representatives of the various organi
zations now in the city are all men of
good sense and not at all on the fire-brand
order. They have come here to make a
reasonable request, and they expect to re
ceive reasonable treatment.
No one can say how President Hunting
ton will treat the matter. The consensus
of opinion Is, however, that he will not
abandon his pet scheme to break up the
brotherhoods.

COLLINS REMANDED TO
THE SHERIFF'S CUSTODY
Alleged Seattle Bank Robber Will
Be Taken Back to Seattle for
Trial.
John Collins, the alleged Seattle bank
robber, will be returned to the scene of
the crime for trial. Judge Lawlor yester
day dismissed the second writ of habeas
corpus sworn out on behalf of the pris
oner and remanded him to the custody of
Deputy Sheriff James W. McLeod and
Detective F. F. Leische, who will take
him to Seattle.
It was contended by George D. Collins,
attorney for the defendant, that the pro
ceedings by -virtue of which his client was
in custody were irregular and illegal, and
the prisoner should be discharged. The
court, however, found that the requisition
papers and warrant were in conformity
with the law and remanded Collins.
Trouble with the prisoner is expected and
he will be closely guarded on the journey
north.
The kidnaping charges against the offi
cers will not be pressed if the present in
activity regarding them can be accepted
as conclusive; but It is certain that Col
lins has a long fight before him If he
hopes to escape conviction on the charge
against him.

There is a tinp* of romance to the affair.
Epperson said h* would give Mrs. Clark
* check for V^<f< \f she would not marry
a certain man. She agreed to keep her
part, llf gave l^r the check, which he
Hftrrward destroyed. Hence the suit. Not

convicted and fined by thÂ»Â« court
KNOWLTON MAY HAVE TO
FACE SERIOUS CHARGES
Parents Make Verbal Complaints but
Superintendent Webster Insists
They Must Be Written.
The Board of Education held a secret
session yesterday morning and considered
at some length the verbal charges filed by
the parents of a number of pupils in the
Everett Grammar School against the vice
principal, Ebenezer Knowlton. . Two of
the parents visited Superintendent Web
ster recently, while a third, Herbert
Maggs, wrote the latter a communcation,
asking for an appointment at which he
intended to prefer charges against Knowl
ton. The Superintendent replied and fixed
a date to hear the charges, but according
to Maggs the meeting had not as yet
taken place.
Superintendent "Webster reported to the
board that he would not bring Knowlton
to trial because the complainants refused
to rile written charges, according to a
strict rule which he had established. He
stated that the most adduced verbally
against the vice principal was that he has
been indiscreet in his methods of impart
ing knowledge to his pupils, half of whom
are girls. For example he persisted in
discussing the Amy Murphy tragedy
shortly after its occurrence, holding up
that young lady and Poullin as horrible
examples. The parents complained to the
principal that they had been Informed by
their children that Knowlton had gone In
to the smallest detail of the unfortunate
affair. They further alleged that Knowl
ton was In the habit of speaking to the
girls in such a manner and upon such sub
jocts as to create some indignation on the
part of parents.
So numerous were the complaints added
to the fact that the discipline In Profes
sor Knowlton's class was not of the best,
that it impelled the principal to request
the board to transfer Knowlton to an
other school having a male principal.
Neither the principal nor the parents will
tile written charges and to the matter
will rest unless the Superintendent's rule
is complied with.
The charges against A. 11. McDonald,
principal of the Lincoln Evening School,
who failed to report his absence during
one month and drew full pay, will also be
dropped by the Superintendent. The ne
glect to mark his absence in his monthly
report was an oversight of McDonald's
and as he made full restitution of the
overdrawn amount Webster recommended
that he be cleared of the charges.
The matter of janitor's salaries for
March was another subject considered at
the secret session and the board decided
to pass them. Superintendent Webster
claimed that there was no law empower
ing tne board to take such action and re
fused to affix his signature to the de
mands. Unless the janitors mandamus
him to do so they will go without their
money for some time to come, as the
Auditor is inclined to side with Webster
in his contention that they should be paid
out of the funds of the Board of Public
Works, which exercise control over them,
and not out of school moneys.
.he Board placed Mrs. L. B. Russell on
the substitute list, which now contains
the full quota of thirty-five. She was the
first of three unasslgned day teachers,
the others being Miss R. F. Lewis and
Miss A. Conroy.
LICENSE RIGHTS
CONSIDERED BY
COMMISSIONERS
Midway Plaisance Will No
Longer Be Allowed to
Disgrace the City.
Fate of the Cafe Boyal and Sporting
Houses of a Similar Character
to Be Decided Next
Week.
The Police- Commissioners met last
night and considered a number of appli
cations for liquor licenses. Permission to
continue running the Midway Plaisance
was denied. Ned Homan. the proprietor
of the place, made en extended appeal to
be allowed to continue in business until
he might be able to get another location.
He also promised to Improve the moral
tone of the Midway, do away with thÂ»
private boxes and make any other im
provements that the Commissioners might
suggest. Homan presented a lengthy pe
tition signed by a number of Market-street
dealers asking that the Midway be grant
ed a license.
Chief Suilivan bitterly resented any at
tempt to reopen the place. He had the
clerK of the board read a report of one of
his men. In which he spoke of the Mid
way as being conducted in an immoral
and disgraceful manner. Prior to the
reading of the report Commissioner Wal
lace seemed in favor of granting Homan's
request for a renewal of his license, but
after listening to it he announced his de
termination to vote against the applica
tion. A vote was then taken, resulting In
Commissioners Newhall and McNutt vot
i? c ?/ c an .Â£ Wallace ana Mahoney no.
President Newhall then announced that
the motion to reopen the Midway haa
been lost and ordered Homan to "close up
chop. r
The application of Horrileln & Krumb of
the. Cafe Royal was next tajten up. At
toney Acn appeared for the proprietors
or the saloon. He addresed the Commis
sioners at length, explaining: the manner
in which poker games were conducted In
the Cafe Royal and the apparent inclina
tion of the proprietors to keep within the
purview of the law. He said that the
games were not run on the percentage
plan, and that minors were forbidden to
play or drink at the bar. At the sugges
tion of the attorney the Commissioners
agreed to visit the place some day this
week and see for themselves how the
games are conducted. Final action on the
application of the proprietors for a license
will then be taken.
The hearing of the application of* E
dward Finn, who conducts a saloon known
as 'The Morgue." at 431 Bush street, for
a license was continued for one week.
His license will expire on April 5. at
which time he was ordered to close his
saloon until the Commissioners shall
have acted on his application.
After considerable' discussion a permit
was isued to M. A. Livingston to contlnu*
conducting a saloon at 17 Leidesdorf?
street. Complaint had been entered
against the place. It being claimed that
gambling was allowed there.
Livingston promised to live up to the
provisions of the charter relative tr> sa
loons, and his application was granted.
Kate Edington was granted permission
to open a saloon at Kearny and Pacific
streets. The hearing of the application;*
for a combined restaurant and saloon
license of Green Bros, on Powell street,
and Morgan & Martin at 14 Eddy street,
were postponed until the next meeting.
Purcell & King, saloonkeepers at Berry
street and Grant avenue, and Mrs. Mary
Sawyer, who conducts! a resort at Fulton
and Devlsadero streets, were denied li
censes. John Geary, who wu recently
refused a license to conduct the Eureka
Music Hall on Kearny street, near Sac
ramento, applied for a permit to reopen
Bottlemeier's. on Pacific street. The ap
plication was granted. At midnight the
Commissioners adjourned to meet next

RAINFALL IS
VERY GENERAL
IN THE STATE
San Diego Visited by a
Greatly Needed
Downpour.
Much Grain and Grass That Other
wise Would Have Been Spoiled
Has Been Saved by the
Precipitation.
Â»
Special Dispatch to The Call
SAN DIEGO, April 3.â The entire county
has been visited by showers all day long.
In the city they were short and the total
precipitation was only .21 of an inch, but
in some other portions of the county the
fall has reached as high as an inch and
more. Save In this southwestern corner
of the county the heaviest fall of rain
has been where it would do the most
good and in some places it will have the
effect of j saving much grain and grass.
The rain' continued late into the night,
both in the mountains and at sea. At sea
there was a tine exhibition of an electric
storm, but there is nothing outside which
would be damaged.
WHEATLAND, April 3.â Yesterday
afte.rnoon a small cyclone destroyed about
ten buildings and smashed things up gen
erally on the Mitchell and Greltman
ranches about two miles south of Sher*
idan. The action of the wind was most
peculiar. On both ranches the residences
were uninjured and barns, sheds and out
houses were completely demolished. On
both ranches the stables were wrecked,
and while there were thirty horses In the
Mitchell stable and eleven in that on the
Greitman ranch not an animal was in
jured.-
A chicken house adjoining the former
barn was swept away and forty chickens
killed. The twister was purely local and
traveled about three miles, but in this
distance it played many strange pranks
and destroyed about $3000 worth of prop
erty.
MONTEREY. April 3.â One of the heav
iest thunder storms ever known in this
vicinity occurred last night and was ac
companied by continuous and heavy rain.
During the night an inch of rain fell,
making 1.61 Inches for the storm which
began Sunday morning. The rain was
much needed as the windstorms of the
past week have dried and parched the
budding trees and plants to an almost
alarming extent. Advices from outlaying
districts announce the rain to be general
throughout the section.
MERCED, April 3.â The farmers are re
joicing over the rain which fell here last
night. It started to fall at 6 o'clock p. m.
accompanied by thunder and lightning,
and continued the greater part of the
night. During the storm nlnety-hun
dredths of an Inch fell.
PLACERVILLE, April 3.â One and flve
hundredths inches of rain has fallen in
this city since Sunday evening last. The
rain will be very beneticial to growing
crops and the stock ranges, insuring late
feed.
SALINAS. April 3.â Monterey County in
general and Salinas In particular have
been treated to much-needed rain during
the last twenty-four hours, with every in
dication for a further downpour. The rain
came In time to insure grain crops as well
as to cause many acres to be put in sugar
beets. The precipitation for Salinas Is .92
for the storm and 11.03 Inches for the sea
son. Reports from outside towns In Sa
linas Valley are as follows: Chualar .45.'
Gonzales .61, Soledad .47, King City .29.
SAN JOSE, April 3.â Showers of rain fell
here last night, the precipitation being .15
of an Inch. This morning all the higher
peaks of Mount Hamilton were buried in
snow. It Is cooler to-day, but the weather
la unsettled. The opinion Is that the rain
has done much good unless frost should
follow.
LOS ANGELES, April 3.â There was a
slight fall of rain here early this morning
and the weather Is still cloudy, with good
indications for mure rain. - Â¦
REPUBLICAN GAINS IN
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS
CHICAGO. April 3.â A very light vote
was cast at the city election to-day. The
contests were chiefly aldermanlc, al
though in each of the various townships
an Assessor, Collector, Supervisor and
Clerk were chosen. The chief interest
centered in the aldermanic vote. Thirty
five of these officials were chosen, the Re
publicans securing nineteen and the Dem
ocrats sixteen. The new Council will
contain fbrty Republicans and twenty
nine Democrats.
In the elections for town officers, the
Republicans carried the south town, the
town of Hyde Park aÂ»d the town of Lake
view, while tho Democrats carried the
north and the west towns and the town
of Lake. In the townships outside of the
city limits the Republicans, as usual,
made a clean sweep.
One phase of the election over which
much bitterness was manifested was the
fight made by the Municipal Voters'
League against what the league denom
inated as "gangsters and grafters." The
league indorsed or repudiated men regard
less of party, sometimes Indorsing as fit
men for office every candidate in a ward
and sometimes repudiating every candi
date. It indorsed In all thirty-nine alder
manic candidates and repudiated twenty
one. Of the thirty-nine Indorsed nine
teen were elected and of the twenty-one
repudiated twelve were elected. In fif
teen wards there were hot contests be
tween the league candidates and the re
pudiated nominees. In these contests In
dorsement was successful seven time and
repudiation eight.
Township elections were held throughout
Illinois to-day and as far as the returns
show at midnight the Republicans seemed
to have elected more of their men than
the Democrats, although the returns are
very incomplete. In none of the elections
was there any Issue of Importance outside
of the townships in which the votes were
cast and the vote of to-day is therefore of
no value for purposes of comparison. In
the city of Qulncy the Democrats carried
the day, electing almost their entire town
ticket." In Jollet and Peoria tho Republi
can ticket was elected and in Kankakee
the Democrats were successful. A small
vote Is reported from all parts of the
State.
Republican Gains in Kansas.
TOPEKA, Kans., April 3.â Municipal
elections were held throughout the State
to-day in cities of the first and second
class. The first class cities voted only
for members of the Board of Education
and City Council, but in cities of the sec
ond class. In addition to the officers. City
Clerk, City Marshal, Attorney and Street
Commissioners were elected. Party lines
were maintained in most cases and the ifc
turns received here up to midnight Indi
cate that the Republicans have generally
been successful. In this city the Repub
lican candidates were elected by the usual
majorities'. Public interest here centered
in a proposition to vote bonds for a sys
tem of public parks, which was defeated.
In Wichita the Republicans made large
gains, carrying every ward in the city
except one. In Abilene, Lawrence. Co
lumbus, Concordia and Eureka the Re
publicans elected all of the candidates on
their tickets. In Arkansas City and
Great Bend they carried a majority of
the offices voted for. In Kansas City,
Kan., the Republicans elected the four
city officers voted for by nominal majori
ties and also elected four of the six Alder
men.
In _A_tchison the Republicans elected all
of their candidates with the exception of
one Councilman. In Parsons the Repub
licans elected their ticket, with the ex
ception of Street Commissioner, one
Councilman and one member of the Board
of Education. Fort Scott elected the Re
publican candidates with the exception of
one member of the Board of Education.
COLBY, Ivans.. April 3.â There will be
no fusion ticket in the Sixth Kansas Con
gressional District. The Democratic Con
gressional convention yesterday nomina
ted Tully Scott of Oberlin. The Populist
convention to-day nominated Dr. John F.
Dinkes of Smith Center, taking this ac
tion after the conference committees from
the two conventions had failed to reach
an agreement to fuse. If given the Con
gressman the Democrats had offered to
concede the Populists all the members of
the State Legislature from the Sixth Dis
trict.
LEAVEN WORTH, Kans.. April 3.â ln
the election to-day the Democrats were
victorious, carrying the six wards for
Councilmen. making the Council seven

Clerk. The Republicans elect the Marshal.
Nebraska Swings Into Line.
OMAHA, Nebr.. April 3.â City and vil
lage elections were held throughout Ne
braska to-day, with the exception of
Omaha. The main issue in most of the
smaller places was license, and the results
are mixed, the greater number of towns
apparently being favorable to licensing
the traffic for another year. While party
politics cut little figure in the smaller
towns, yet Republican gains are notice
able all over the State.
South Omaha, for the first time in its
history, elects a Republican Mayor, A.
Rellly being the successful candidate, by
300 plurality. The Republicans also elect
Treasurer, all four Councilmen and two
out of three members of the School
Board. Last year Ensor, Democrat, was
elected Mayor by 1200 majority.
Lincoln gives the largest Republican
majority for years, and makes a clean
sweep on the local ticket. Crete, for years
Democratic, gives a Republican majority.
O'Neill and Ashland are also Republican.
Up to midnight few of the smaller places
have reported any Democratic or fusion
pains.
ST. LOUIS, April 3.â Municipal elections
were held to-day in many towns in Mis
souri. The results where party lines were
drawn were on the whole favorable to
the Democrats. The Republicans made
their gains chiefly at Sedalla and St. Jo
seph. In the latter place local issues led
to the defeat of the Democrats. At Se
dalia the slight plurality of the Demo
crats at the last election was overcome
and the city again went Republican. The
Democrats elected a straight ticket in
Springfield for the first time. At Mary
ville they turned a Republican majority
into a Democratic majority of 300. Ful
ton, Joplin and other places were swept
by the Democrats. Party lines, however,
were not strictly drawn in many places.
No election was held in St. Louis.
ST. JOSEPH, Mo., April 3.â lndications

Wisconsin Results.
MILWAUKEE. Wls.. April 3.â Mayor
Davis S. Rose. Democrat, triumphed at
the municipal election in this city to-day
and carried the rest of the city ticket with
him. He will have a plurality of at least
5000. William Bollow and John R. Wolf
were re-elected Treasurer and Comptroller
respectively. Mayor Rose stood on a plat
form setting forth the recent 4-cent fare
ordinance and cheaper water rates, which
legislation was enacted during his past
administration. Henry J. Baumgartner,
the Republican candidate, campaigned
against the manner in which the street
railways ordinance was alleged to have
been railroaded through the Common
Council.

throughout Wisconsin, outside of Milwau
kee, shows that where the Republicans and

ber of victories. Republican Mayors were

TWO USEFUL LIVES
DEATH HAS ENDED
DAVID JACKSON STAPLES died at
his home, 711 Taylor street, early
yesterday morning. He had been
ailing lor some time. The cause of death
was general debility, due to old age and
allnunts. He was born in Medway. Mass..
May 3, 1524. For many years Mr. Staples
was one of the most prominent figures in
the commercial life of San Francisco.
Since 1M59 he has been president of the
Fireman's Fund Insurance Company up
to the beginning of the present year. He
was an active member for a long period of
all the commercial organizations of the
city. He came to California around Cape

Then he went with his brother to the
mines after the bark, in which they were

Stole a Shank of Beef.
John Burns, a ranchhand from Sacra
mento, stole a shank of beef from the
butcher shop of Lee Sun, 10>Â£ Washington
alley, Monday afternoon and was arrestuct
for petty larceny. He told Judge Mogan
yesterday that he had no money and
wanted to get back to Sacramento, where
he had friends. He did not know why he
stole the shank of beef, only he felt des
perate. As he was a respectable-look
ing young fellow the Judge dismissed th*
case and gave him $1 50 to help him back
home.- ;/Â¦â>-,..,-..â¢

The office furniture is in a lumber room,
where it has been many months.
A long dispatch was received from The
Call correspondent in New York last
night. He tells of a visit to Skancke's
headquarters at 96 Fifth avenue, that city,
as follows:
A bright-looking typewriter girl, with
an Irish cast of countenance, seemed to
be "on to her job" and gave evasive an
swers to most questions. She said Platt
could not be seen, as he was out of the
city. It is probable she spoke the truth.
L. G. Skancke seems to be running the
lottery concern in Platt's name. The
office door has one sign reading, "D. F.
Platt" and another VSan Benlto Mining
Company."
Not having elicited much information
by personal application, letters were ad
dressed to "D. F. Platt," making inquiries
about his loan and investment company,.
The following reply was received: .
C. C. Carlton. care I. B. Gateo. 158 West
Twenty-first street. New Yorkâ Dear Sir: -In
reply to yours. 26th inst. . tvlll say you must be
somewhat contused \ in regard to certificate of
application and "next drawing," etc., as I do
not know anything about a next drawing. Per
haps our tenderloin district has been too much
for you since you arrived In the city, which
may account for this confused state of mind
you are now in. I will suggest you brine the
certificate you mention to mv office. Yours
very truly, D. F. PLATT.
This letter was typewritten on a plain
sheet of paper, the signature being also
typewritten. The envelope was plain also
and the letter was registered by the foxy
agent, who hoped thus. to locate sleuths,
whom he doubtless Imagined to be on his
trail. A visit was then made to the office
of the Realty Loan and Investment Com
pany, owners of the building in which the
lottery office is located. The agent said
he had never seen Mr, Platt, but the office
had -been rented by Mr. Jones of Chicago,
who, he added, was a good tenant and
always paid his rent promptly. He said
Jones' agent, "Mr. Platt." had occupied
an office in the building for at least three
years.
The colored janltress at 56 Fifth avenue
declared she was "rather skittish about
answering questions." When asked If Mr.
Platt was absent from the city, she re
plied: "He must have gone to-day.
Leastways he was ' here yesterday. I
don't know whether his name is Platt
or Skancke."
"What did he say his name was?"
"Oh. honey. I know my business," said
she, chuckling over her own shrewdness.
Next door neighbors admitted they did
not know much about Mr. Platt, but said
the business seemed to be conducted by
only one individual, whose name was
Skancke, though he received mail and did
business in Platt's name. The lottery
lions were then literally bearded In their
own den. The outer office of the two oc
cupied by the concern contains two tables
for folding circulars and four desks. â¢ A
brass chain extending from a desk to a
glass partition bars the entrance to the
interior of the room. The inner office has
a heavy curtain over the glass door that
leads to it from the hall, which is kept
locked. The entrance is by way of a door
opening into the outer office. The build
ing has an entrance on Fifth avenue and
another on West Fifteenth street.
The typewriter girl rattled a piece of
paper to attract the attention of the man
in the room. She pointed out the Call-
Herald representative and declared:
"There is the man I warned you against.
He was here the other day."
Upon inquiry for Mr. Platt, both were
silent. The fine-looking man, of rather
imposing proportions, his hair slightly
tinged with gray, gray oyes and mus
tache and wearing a gray tweed suit, was
pacing the floor nervously, making a pre
tense of reading a newspaper. He was
finally compelled to admit that his name
was Skancke. but with some show of
indignation, denied that he was L. G.
Skancke of San Francisco who left there
after the lottery was raided and who was
afterward arrested in Boston. There is
no doubt, however, that he Is the same
man.
D. F. Platt, who may be deo3. Is, the
mythical "Pecky Harris" of this lottery
enterprise. Letters and express packaees
are addressed to "D. F. Platt." The
mythical "Platt" pays the rent and con
ducts all business, but In reality the fine
looking Skancke is the real culprit. It
does not appear that 'much lottery busi
ness is transacted by mail, for the postal
carrier who delivers mall to that building
fays few letters are received by Mr. Platt
It appears, however, that a considerable
number of express packages are received.
This is probably done to evade section 331
of the postal laws and regulations. ,
Fifteen minutes after the interview
with Skancke that enterprising Individual
came down Fourteenth street with two
bundles of pafiers under his arms and de
posited then in the United States Express
office near Fifth avenue. They sepmed to
be -circulars. Skancke. while willing to
invite others to take a chance, was not
willing to take any himself, and was
doubtless getting rid of evidences of guilt.
The name of Dedrick Platt. broker. S6
Fifth avenue. aDpears.in the Directory,
but there is no Skancke. This individual
has deemed it best to conceal his identity,
hs far as possible since his: conviction in
Boston.

Call that Eastern people were writing zo
San Francisco to hnd out about Lathrop
& Co. One letter came from George E.
Heatherby. cashier of the First National
Bank of Shullsberg, Wis.. who sent on a
ticket, otherwise "certificate," stating
that he did this in behalf of a friend who
said that it was worth $10. With it was
a lottery sheet, that could not well be
disguised, issued by the Guaranty Loan
and Trust Company, which showed that
there were 100,000 tickets allowed for.
Another letter came from S. H. Legg,
of the Standard Oil Company's office at
Bloomlngton. 111., in which information
was asked concerning the "fairness" of
Lathrop & Co. The attention of the
Bank Commissioners was called to the
facts and they addressed a letter to the
Guaranty Loan and Trust Company at
1236 Market street, calling attention to the
act in the Civil Code authorizing certain
corporations to act as executor and in
other capacities and to provide for and
regulate the administration of trusts by
corporations"; also asking whether the
company came under the provisions of the
act. This letter went unanswered for
many days. When response was finally
made it came from D. H. Jones at Chi
cago, in which he assumed to be the
company. It was signed, in typewritten
lotters. "D. H. Jones. Guaranty Loan and
Trust Company. 1615 Masonic Temple."
A part of this letter follows:
"I do not know whether the company
complies strictly with the statute to
which you refer or not. but I do know
that it complies with the laws of the
States of Illinois and New York, as well
as with the laws of the United States. I
cxnect to be in San Francisco soon and
will be pleased to call upon you. when
there, and go into details, whereby we
may know if we are conflicting- with the
statute or not. In the meantime I will
be glad if you will furnish me with a
copy of th*Â» section of the statute to which
you refer."
Considering that the company has no
office in San Francisco and that the pre
tense of an office was maintained evi
dently for the furtherance of a. swindle,
this letter may be put safely in the class
of the unique.
The Guaranty I/oan and Trust Company
was Incorporated in this city just as the
advertisement sent out by Jones sets
forth. The incorporators wore D. H
Jones. Virginia City; E. W. Wheeler
Oakland; C. R. Slawson and S. P. Platt'
San Francisco, and J. C. Pinto. Havana!
Cuba. The concern entered into business
in the Murphy building and the police
found out that it was a lottery concern
and raided the offices. There was a cer
tain bright girl who was employed by
Jones. Norah Walker by name, who was
in when the police came. No lottery tick
ets were found in the offices, but a lot was
discovered in the coal bunkers in the hall
way, and the police always credited Xorah
with speedy work to protect the lottery
people. Not long after this Jones went
away to Chicago and the scheme that has
ripened was developed. He and Skancke
were reached by the law. but they have
continued in the same line since. Their
advertisement and the lottery sheel called
by them "prospectus," shows, when they
are put together, that the scheme con
templated a commission, to them of $40
noo out of every $100 ,000 taken in at least

STATE PRISON
DIRECTOR MAY
SOON BE NAMED
Governor Gage Has Heard o?
the Cordage Bill Scan
dal of 1895.
Letter Written fey Charles Sonntag
to President Tubbs â An Inci-
Sent of Bud'd's* Adminis
tration.
Topics connected wi^h State Prison man
agement are now engaging the- attention
of politicians. Democrats as well as Re
publicans are surprised over certain
events. Even two Prison Directors were
surprised when "Mr. Wilkinson was re
moved from the office of Commissary at
San Quentin to make room for Francis
Foley. It is said that Governor Gage de
manded this change. Mr. Wilkinson,
however, found a better berth than that
of Commissary through the assistance of
his stanch supporters on the Prison Direc
tory. He was appointed Warden at Fol
som while two of the Directors were
tardily engaged in the work- of program
ming the board In the interest of a candi
date in San Francisco.
Word comes from the north that the
politicians of Sacramento are greatly dis
turbed over the annointment of E. L.
Fitzgerald to the position of Commissari
at FoiSom. Ernest Dettleback was dis
placed to make the opening for the ex-
Labor Commissioner.
George E. Lamphrey, lieutenant of the
guard at Folsom, received his walking
papers recently. He was succeeded by
George J. Haggerty, turnkey at the prison.
The rate of Lamphrey causes deep dis
tress in certain circles of Sacramento.
Daniel E. Hayes' term of office as Prison
Director expired last January. Directors
Devlin, Fitzgerald, Wilkins and Ray are
wondering whether the Governor will re
appoint Mr. Hayes, or take up a new man
for the place. Charles Sonntag, who
served on the board during the admin
istration of Governor Waterman, Is work
ing actively to secure appointment as Mr.
Hayes' successor. The story goes that
Sonntag heard from the inside that Gov
ernor Gage entertained special admira
tion for General Alger and also had pro
found respect for public sentiment in
Michigan. Accordingly Sonntag laid the
wires to connect with the friendly cur
rent In Michigan and succeeded in getting
Alger's indorsement for the coveted place.
When Henry P. Sonntag of the North
End Improvement Club presented peti
tions for an extra session of the Legisla
ture it was surmised In certain quarters
that an implied agreement had been made
whereby Sonntag's brother Charles should
be Prison Director. The closest friends of
the administrationâ the holders of office
and others who expect to enjoy the favor
of the office-holdingâ assert positively
that Gage was never off his guard an in
stant in the Sonntag presence. It is as
serted, moreover, that Gage is familiar
with the cordage bill scandal in the Leg
islature of 1895. having heard the particu
lars of a letter written by Charles Sonn
tag to President Tubbs. wherein it was
suggested that the Cordage Company
should pay $2500 for services rendered at
Sacramento in securing the defeat or
withdrawal of the bill providing for the
manufacture of cordage at San Quentin
Prison.
Whether Governor Gage is or is not fami
liar with the incidents of this scandal the
truth can be brought out by investigation.
This much is at present known. 'Governor
Budd had nearly made up his mind to ap
point Charles Sonntag, a Republican,
Prison Director, when he was informed
that Judge Henshaw, son-in-law of Mr.
Tubbs. had in his possession a letter writ
ten by Sonntag to Tubbs, which contained
a request for the payment of $2500 on ac
count of service rendered in defeating the
cordage bill. Governor Budd does not rec
ollect that he saw the letter, but he was
so deeply impressed with the statement
that such a letter existed andcould be pro
duced, if desired, by Judge Henshaw, that
he dismissed the thought of signing Sonn
tag's commission.
When the bill was pending in the Legis
lature the leading stockholders of the
Cordage Company were very bitter
against Senator Seymour for advocating a
measure to break down their new indus
try by the establishment of a cordage
plant at-San Quentin. The Senator, hear
ing of the indignation, squared himself
by asserting that he introduced the meas
ure at Sonntag's request. When the sub
ject reached the executive office. Gov
ernor Budd advised the people who were
protesting against the bill not to pay a
dollar to defeat the legislation.

IS A BLACKMAILER
Ij. Scatena Defendant in an Action to
Recover Money, Property and
Damages.
' In a suit filed yesterday Mrs. Mary Buja
charges L. Scatena with' having extorted
$1500 from her through threats of having
her son, Nicholas, sent to prison on a
charge of embezzlement. He also forced
her by threats, menace and duress, she
says, to give him a note and mortgage on
her home at 810 Green street, and she asks
the court to give her judgment canceling
the note and mortgage and decreeing that
she recover ' the $1500 paid out by her,
together with $1000 damages.. Mrs. Bula
says Scatena, prior to August 15, 1897,
caused the arrest of her son on two
charges of "embezzlement. "Subsequently
he, went to her and said v that he would
press the charges against" her son' unless
she paid him $1500 and. gave her the note
and mortgage referred to. .Fearful that
he would carry out his threat, she says,
she agreed to what sne, terms his extor
tionate demands and gave away. her all.
She now: seeks to .recover , the property
given into the hands of Scatena under the
belief that' she .was saving her son from

WIDOW HOFFMAN MAKES
CHARGES OF FRAUD
She Brings Suit Against Her Dead
Husband's Brother for a
Large Sum.
Mrs. Dora Hoffman, as administratrix
of the estate of Isaac Hoffman, has filed
suit in the United States Circuit Court
against Charles Hoffman, a brother of
her deceased husband, to recover $21,274 62
alleged to be due the estate.
Isaac Hoffman was a member of the
clothing firm of Hoffman. Rotlichild &
Co., in this city, and was murdered in his
store on Bush street on June 25, 1897, by
some person or "persons unknown to the
jury that tried and acquitted Theodore
Figel. ;
The complaint recites that Charles and
-saac were partners In the business up to
May 1, 1896. on which date they took in
Edward S. Rothchild as an equal partner,
their stock etc., at that time being val
ued at $197,549 24. In forming the new
firm, It is alleged that each of the three
put in $75,000, Charles and Isaac taking
their $150,000 out of the old business and
loaning, the remainder, $47,549 24. It is
further alleged that Charles fraudulently
and falsely represented to her that Isaac
had transferred his interest in the re
maining $47,549 24 for a valuable consider
ation and that he induced her for a gift
of $2500 to assign to him, Charles, all her
husband's interest, which she did, be
lieving at the time that his representa
tions were -true. _ .
nearly a page to expose the Guaranty
Loan and Trust Company of California
and Empire State Lottery Company, sup
posed to-be allied to the California con
cern. As a result David H. Jones and
Lawrence G. Skancke were arrested In
Boston October 4, 1894, and were charged
with maintaining a lottery in that city.
Jones was said to be the head of the
Guaranty Loan and Trust Company and
Skancke was his assistant. Both men
were found guilty. Neither man offered
any defense, but both endeavored to ob
tain mitigation of sentence by promising
to leave the State for good.
Jones was sentenced to the House of
Correction for three months and ordered
to pay a fine of $200. Skancke escaped
with a fine of $200.
Except that in 1894 the company an
nounced itself to be only in the sixth yeai
of successful operation, and the names of
agents and auditor were then different,
their circular of January 23, 1900. is identi
cal with one dated April 20, 1594. which
purported to give a drawing or allotment
of loans. In 1594 the auditor was A. R.
Ward. His place has now been taken by
H. B. Lansing. In 1594 the same Lansing
was cashier and secretary of the Bankers'
Mutual Company of 27 East Fourteenth
street, an alleged lottery, which was sup
posed to have been operated in connection
with the Guaranty Loan and Trust Com
pany and Empire State Lottery.
Postoffice Inspector King to-day pointed
out to The Call correspondent the fact
that circulars of the Guaranty Loan and
Trust Company directed money to be for
warded by express. As a consequence it
might be hard to secure evidence that lot
tery communications had been transmit
ted through mails/but Skancke may be
indicted for obtaining under false pre
tenses letters addressed to Platt.
The Call's Washington correspondent
wires the following information about
George F. Curtis, -who appears to be the
San Francisco agent of tho lottery:
Â¦ "Curtis, grandson of a naval officer of
high rank, believed to be a native of the
District of Columbia, was graduated at
Georgetown Law School, and about nina
years ago became connected with the
Congressional library. He remained there
five or six years, was legarded- as in
telligent and industrious, and nothing was
known about him while there injuriously
affecting his personal Integrity or habits.
Hut certain positive facts of tempera
ment made him in many ways unsatis
factory to library officials and disagree
able to all with whom he came in contact.
While on a vacation in Switzerland, it Is
understood he got into a difficulty from
which it required the services of United
States officials to extricate him. Exactly
what the trouble was is not known. .When
the library force was reorganized in 1897.
no provision was made for his retention.
This, was a way of : getting rid of. him.
His usefulness in the library and general
reputation were impaired by reason of
eccentricities of character which made
him somewhat unreliable rather than by
distinctly bad qualities.,"

THIS morning The Call
unmasks a gigantic
swindle, engineered by
D. H. Jones and L. G.
Skancke, formerly of this city,
who are now operating in the
Eastern cities, end who, un
der the guise of agents of a
Guaranty Loan and Trust
Company, are operating a lot
tery. They are in receipt of
from $75,000 to $100,000
per month, and they number
their victims by the hundreds
of thousands. Their opera
tions are as huge, in a differ
ent way, as were those of Mil
ler, the Brooklyn scoundrel,
whose fraudulent banking
schemes resulted in the rob
bery of thousands of victims
of their only means of subsist
ence. Jones and Skancke are
pretending that their home
office is in San Francisco and
are using the name of this
city as a bait for the gud
geons who nibble at the lur
ing bait that they put out.
y NFORMATTON was recently brougr
I to the attention of The Call that ac
I vertisements were being circulated 1
I the East in which a certain "Guai
Â¦*" anty Loan and Trust Company" wa
â¢^presented to be doing business in th
Murphy building in this city under th
agency of Lathrop & Co. The busine*
was ostensibly the dealing in investmer
>onds. With a copy of the advertisemer
vas received a number of so-called "cci
iflcates," which were really lottery tick
Â¦is i:n.ler a very noor dissruise.
It was speedily ascertained that there
is no concern doing any sort of business
in the Murphy building under the name
of Lathrop & Co. There never had been
a Lathrop & Co. there, but there had been
one D. H. Jones, impersonating Lathrop
& Co., who v.as concerned in the Guaranty
Loan and Trust Company, but the office
had been closed long before and there was
no one to represent the concern in the
city except a pretty young girl. Miss S. L.
Uuscher. who frankly said that she knew
that there was no Lathrop & Co. in the
city. She said that she had been working
for D. H. Jones and that she knew noth
ing about his business, but that he did all
that was done in the name of Lathrop &
Co. when he was last here and that he haa
given orders that all the mail addressed
to Lathrop & Co. should be forwarded to
him at Chicago, where he had been many
months. She had sent on the letters,
which were not many, and she was look
ing for pay. which had not been forth
coming for a long time.
The advertisement read as follows in
part: "Guaranty Loan and Trust Com
pany, San Francisco. Incorporatea under
the laws of California May 13. ISSVt. for
titty years, with a capital stock of JSyO.Oftt.
Home office, junction of Market. Jones
and McAllister streets, San Francisco."
Then there were addresses of other agen
cies contained in the following paragraph:
"Applicatioi. for these loans must be made
through banks or at our office in San
Francisco. Correspondents solicited in
every town and city in the United State?
and Canada. For rull information apply
to or address either of the following firms:
I-ithrop & Co., K3S Market street, San
Francisco; Charles H. Kissam, 125 Dear
born street. Chicago; E. F. Platt, &5 Fifth
avenue. New Yotk; George Strickland,
Melbourne, Australia; J. W. Fassett,
Honolulu, H. 1. All business and commu
nications from east of the Rocky Moun
tains must be addressed to our New York
oi Chicago office."
It was soon found that there was no J.
W. Fassett at Honolulu and that the Chi
cago office was really run by D. H. Jones
and the New York office by L. G. Skancke.
The last named was formerly a clerk
employed by a rubber company that has
its office in the Murphy building. There
he became acquainted with Jones, who
took him East when he went away.
This discovery that there was no San
Francisco agency or Honolulu agency and
that the imposing names of the agencies
In the East had been simmered down to
Jones and Skancke, both of whom were
known to ha.vÂ«: been in trouble with the
police in the East, showed at once the
nature of the whole concern. The agent
of the Murphy building was notified of
the use that was being made of the prop
erty for the deluding of the guileless East
erner, and he at once gave an order that
'no more mail for Lathrop &T Co. should
be received there. Simultaneously Miss
Buscher, learning of the nature of the
concern, declined to have anything more
to do with Jones.
Miss Uuscher was found at her home
1n Castro street. She is* pleasing of ap
pearance and manners. She at once freed
herself of any suspicion that might have
attached to her by giving all the informa
tion she could that would lead to locating
Jones. His address was given. from
which it appeared that Jones was not at
the address of Klssam in Chicago, being
located in the Masonic Temple building
She was much agitated when she learned
the facts and was concerned, because she
feared that her last chance for getting
her overdue pay was lost. The facts were
pent to the correspondent rf The Call in
New York and he has succeeded in run
ning down Skar.cke, who would not ac
knowledge anything and took the first
opportunity to rid himself of evidences of
the business in which he is concerned
The "certificates' secured by The Call,
otherwise lottery tickets, bad on the back
of them the date whoa they were collect
ible and one by its number pave the clew
to the surprising fact that Jones and
Skancke, in the first two weeks of Jan
uary, ISfOO. or prior to January 13, had suc
ceeded in difposir.gr of at least J75.(M)
worth of tickets. This would Imply a
business of about SJ.ftOO.OOO per annum.
About this time the news came to The
Jones and Skancke, Who Were Once Known Here,. Working the
East With a Lottery Scheme That Is Yielding an Income
of Seventy-Five Thousand Dollars a Month.
