lice,- but undoubtedly. there were as many
more of which' we were not aware. lie
waB a 1 murderer and thief, as bud an ail
round/criminal and as hard a one to catch
as ever swung on .the gallows.
I There was a nobler sort of desperado
who- stalked '.this country In the days of
oldâ the stage robber. There was a prince
of. stage robbers called Rattlesnake Dick,
and* he died . as gameâ but that's antici
pating.:. . Â¦
Rattlesnake Dick was first seen around
Rattlesnake: Bar, and that's how he got
his nickname, lie made up his mind that
there was an easier way of getting goid
than. digging for it. and he tooK to holding
up stages for a living.
Ratti .snake Dick and a fellow stage rob
ber called George -Taylor started from
Trinity Mountain to hold up a six-mule
train loaded with gold. When, they came
upon the niulej they found that others of
their ilk had already relieved the animals
of their burden of gold. '
â¢ The posse of men hunting for the thieves
and. believing them the guilty ones gave
them chase and fired at* them. Rattle
snake and his companion* made their way
."unharmed through' the- storm of bullets
'.until Â¦ they came to old English ' Ellen's,
who kept a road houseâ and anything else
she could get. "â¢ Here George Taylor drew
rein and turning to Rattlesnake Dick 3uid:
"Old fellow, we've been shot at by every
man we've met -since- we left Trinity
-Mountain. I'm sick of it, and I'm gains
to quit the business." Many a time after
â¢ ward did Taylor tell me this story. -
Rattlesnake Dick picked , up a fellow
named Sam Beaver. " Near the Widow
.Harmon's they met John Boggs and three
deputy sheriffs. Boggs put his hand under
his ulster as If to draw, a revolver, but In
a second three shots rang out from Rat
tlesnake Dick's six-shooter. One officer
fell dead and two -were wounded. Rattle

and shouting. "You will never get me in

out," rode swiftly after his retreating
comrade.
never give way on a mend or foe. OneÂ©
only did he give Information and then he
took me to a place where I captured a
crook fijkT whom there was a reward of
$500. I offered Pete half, but no amount
of persuasion would make him take it.
"I'd steal first," said Pete. "1 told be
cause he was a sneak who peached on the
other boya in the penitentiary and sot
them beatings they never deserved. But
I won't touch the money."
Pete never robbed the poor people. Ha
went In for big steals, but. like all his
kind, he finally lost his grip. Lees saw
him several ytars ago leaning against a
lamppost in St. Louis. He was in the last
stages of consumption and his rags were
but little protection against the bitter
cold. Lee3 forced $20 into his hand. "I'vo
known the time when I wouldn't have
taken this." said Pete, "but the grass is
pretty short now."
Â¦Now and then criminals reform and.
walk, the straight road for the rest of
their lives. I know one man. en ex-thlef.
who Is now a day laborer, making an hon
est living and is a square, industrious
man. ..
. "Sure-thing" gamblers are often liber
al fellows with streaks of goodness in
their make-ups. And the best men I've
ever met In my life were straight gam
blers. They were gamblers who'd play for
any stake, but played square. Briggs,
one of the best known gamblers of the
early days, was the biggest hearted, most
generous gambler who ever cut a deck of
cards. He was robbed of two thousand
dollars and came to report the case. "Tho
man who took It didn't know me." he
said. "Why?" I asked. "Why." he an
swered. "Ben, if he had he'd just havo
asked me for It."
In forty years* experience with crimi
nals I've never met or heard of one who
didn't sooner or later reap as he had
sown. A criminal Is a foot. If he put the
same amount of industry, energy and dar
ing into anything else he'd have a Ion?
bank account. |fcgl|B8|Wggg&g|
knew he had gone to tell-me. â¢ "Ben,", said"
Mortimer, "If I'd had time that night I'd
have waited a little longer, and If you had
come up the other side 1 of 'the street, I '
think, ben, my boy, I'd have given you a
bullet."
At last we had a clew to Mortimer. The
night that William H. Coleman spoke on
the old plaza We saw Ellen Brenn in the
crowd. 1311 en was Mortimer's pal, and' we
knew he couldn't be far away. Â¦ Following
up the clew we traced Mortimer down to
Belmont. A man named Rose went down
there to trap him, but Mortimer. was! the
smarter rogue of the two. * Rose knew
Mortimer had robbed; Myers' pawnshop;
and Mortimer agreed to enow Rose where
the booty was buried.- "He took him out
to a pretended spot, and while Rose was
digging for the treasure Mortimer knocked
him senseless}. \ -
"We've got to get that fellow, and We'll
start right now," Lees said as soon as we
heard It. John Connolly, Jim Bovee; Lees
and -myself .boarded- an Â«nginetand- went
down there. I was something of-a dandy
In those days, and had a pretty extensive
and expensive wardrobe.^ Well, Â« I had on
the best of the lot when = Lees tumbled us
on that engine. We got off at. Belmont
and hunted him through the chaparral. â¢
At the first trace of him .we separated,
and I made south and took - up guard
against a tree, with a six-shooter ready
a man named West, wno lived on Steven-,
son street. The morning of the robbery
a man called at the house and told the
servant girl that he wished to go up to"
Mr. West's room.". "I brought him home
last night." he added. "Why.'flr. you
mean Mr. Wiggins." said the girl. The
stranger explained that the name West
on the doorplate had confused him and
walked upstairs Into Mr. Wiggins' room.
He left Wiggins unconscious and minus
all his money and Jewelry.
The night before Wiggins had been in
a saloon and had casually remarked that
he' had a sack of money he was going to
send home to his parents. Bystanders
said a man who answered to Mortimer's
description was drinking at the bar at. the
time" but evidently paid no attention to
Wiggins and left Immediately.
We could see Mortimer's smooth nnger
tracks right through the job. He had
heard Wiggins talk and he hung around
outside till early morning, when Wiggins
left the raloon. Mortimer followed him
home; and later in the morning he boldly
called, mixed up the names, but landed
the money and jewelry all right. - ,'
We tried for months to find' a trace of
Mortimer, but he had completely disap
peared. There was a crook named Hoett
who offered to lay for him for $100. Hoett
was the sort of man who would have
murdered a hundred men for that price,
providing he didn't have to risk his own
miserable neck by so doing.
One night Hoett came to me in great
excitement. He had Just left Mortimer,
who was Inra thieves' den, . covering a
dozen or more crooks with a pistol.
"vVe didn't recognize him at first." said
Hoett: "he had on a pair of green specks.
He Just stepped ' Into the room and said,
â¢I've left something In this place and I'm
going to get It. I'll- shoot the first â¢
man who tries to leave it.' I was near
the door and'out before he finished say
ing It.", concluded Hoett. â¢
We went to the den, but our bird had
flown. Mortimer afterward told me that
he beard Hoett had been in the room and
.,...Â« mwmvmr kÂ« iÂ«i I J'liiR a small' Dag.
Suddenly the pursuer grabbed him,, struck
out and Flsttr fell to thÂ«i ground. I was
ready with a six-shooter, and I piped it to
him in the mouth. The thief threw the
bag Into the street and said, "There it is."
The game didn't work. Had I stooped for
the bag a hlow would have laid me out
beside Fister.
I tooted my -whistle and Jim Bovee came
running up from the next beat. "Jim,
crab this follow." I said. "He's a hitter
trom Hittervllle." I startfd'to pick up the
bag when Fister rolled over and grabbed
me. He- was coming to, and mistook me
for the thief. Finer would have made an
elephant look like a postage stamp, and it
wasn't exactly pleasant to bear his
weight. When we were disentangled we
examined the contents of the bagâ $933
rolled up and tied with a string.
Jim and I took the thief to the station,
where he gave the name of Charley Mor
limer. He was tried before old Judge
Blakn, nnd a sound for surprised ears it
was to hoar Mortimer plead his own case.*
The evidence against him was complete, !
but he gave them a speech that got him
off with one year at the penitentiary. Xo

In a simple, manly way Raid he had lost
everything he owned at Sacramento, that
he was starving here, and not knowing
the man was carrying money he had at
tacked him in the hope of getting pro
visions. The Judge swallowed this fairy
tale.
Mortimer was an exemplary prisoner
during his year in the penitentiary. When
he was eet free he came back here and I
saw him frequently, always with a hard
crowd. From the flist I had made up my
mind that Charley Mortimer was a thor
oughbred in his line â as bad an they make
them. Now in the light of hla afterdec-ds
I realize how richly he deserved It. We
watched him pretty closely, but could
fasten nothing on him.
One morning we woke up to hear that
Charley Wiggins, the Mayor's clerk, had
been robbed in broad daylight whils yet
In bed. Wiggins roomed at the houee of
* But others joined Boggs. and Rattle
cnake Dick's day had come. The Widow
Harmon, lookinv" from her window, saw
Him reel in his saddle and fall. The Sher
iff ana his men picked up the dead body
of Rattlesnake Dick, shot by his own
hand when he saw capture before him.
Pinned in his gauntlet they found a slip
of paper with these words clearly written;
"Rattlesnake Dick dies, but never surren
ders, as all true Britons should. If Boggs
Is dead I'm happy." They also found a
letterâ a letter which I have to this day â
and the most beautiful letter I ever read
in my life. It Is headed "Home, Sweet
Home." and heps him to Rive up his dis
honorable pilfering. It is signed "Your
loving sister. Harriet Barter."
I met old John Boggs on the street tha
other day and we talked over old times.
"Rattlesnake Dick was dead game, if hfÂ»
did want to klll.me." he said. Boggs told
me that his reaching under his linen dus
ter for a weapon was merely a bluff. aÂ»
he was really unarmed and had met Dick
and his companion unexpectedly.
George Taylor, who had quit Dick Just
before the Bogss affair, was arrested on
reaching San Francisco and sent to tho
penitentiary. His story of leaving Diclc
was not believed, though It wan after
ward proven true and Beaver Identified as
the companion who was with Rattlesnake
Dick. Taylor bad hl3 own ideas of honor
and he never budged an Inch from thÂ»
rule he set down for himself. Many a time
when I've asked him to tell me something
he'd say: "Ben, I can't do It. I never
did give way on anybody and now that
I've quit the business I'd be thÂ« meanest
cur living to do it." If Taylor didn't want
to talk he'd frankly tell you so and what
ever he did say you could bank on It.
"Ben." said George Taylor to me on thÂ«
day he came out of the penitentiary,
"there is a little woman up in the coun
try who Is* an angel out of heaven. She
hid me once when the Sheriff was hunting
me. Her husband's the meanest hound
that ever went unwhipped and I've jfot a
mind to eo no and kill him." I don't th'nk
he did kill him. but I heard that the man,
died and George married the widow and
left the country to benn life over again.

Chariey Mortimer is one of -these. He

desperate .deeds still, live m the. minds of
the "'old guard." I first saw Charley
Mortimer in 1Â»C1. the year of the flood at
Sacramento. Sacramento was Inundated
and San Francisco was flooded with Sac
ramento people. We were short on the
police and I was completely worn out.
Late one night I stepped Into a doorway
to rest for a moment. I saw three men
walking single file, Indian style, turn the
corner of Jackson and Dupont streets and
go up toward Washingion. One man I
recognized as Conrad KJster, who drove
a. water supply cart, the other was a sol
dier and the third unknown to me. The
unknown passed the soldier and pressed
closer to Filter. I noticed In the dim lijjht

over my experiences there are a few fig

from the shadowy mass of crooks and
thieves. If they have their prototypes to

CRIMINALS I HAVE KNOWNChickasaw Girls Object
TO A MARRIAGE LICENSE
oF One Thousand Dollars
I! Is Interesting to note that the early
Egyptian custom of paying gold In tha
form of rings has not entirely died out In
Africa at the present day. and that En
glish merchants trading with the Kongo
â¢re quite accustomed to 'receiving gold
in the form of rings, frequently orna
mented with the signs of the zodiac In rÂ«-
to absolute control of the Covmcil last fall
â¢Â¦ they passed a law charging $1000 for mar
riage licenses to nan-citizens. The other
marriage law was abolished altogether.
President McKinley approved the act and
Â¦"â¢'. It was put into full force and effect on
March 26 last. The new law gave the
girl the privilege of eloping to
Kansas or ; some other State and marry
'"Â¦ ing whomsoever she chose, but by so do-
Ing she lost her headright.
Now some men consider this headright
, a very important adjunct to the Chicka-
of good moral character and Industrious
habits; must be recommended by at least
five responsible citizens . of the county
Â¦wherein they reside; pay. a license fee of
550, and finally, all must be approved by"
the County Judge.' This act confers the
right of citizenship upon all non-citUcna
who marry citizens, but same rights shall
be forfeited in case of separation by di r
vorcc. Persons found guilty of plural
marriage must separate forever; adultery
is punished by a fine of $50 and imprison
ment."
This act pleased both sides and for five
or six years was entirely satisfactory. Of
course, the nation filled with white men
who married Ch'ickasaw women, but thes^
white men were of good character and
added greatly to the development of the
Chickasaw Nation. The fertile soil, under
Industrious touches, was made to bear
cotton, wheat and other, grain. The'In
dians received, revenues from their land
far beyond their 'fondest dreams. ;
But the full-bloods kept themselves in
the mountains and wooded land. ' They
looked upon the Influx of whites as thejr
doom. Medicine men prophesied a des
election of the whole race .unless the
arose and expelhd the palefaces
from their midst, So in 1S94 the full-blood
element, nuntbyring some 7500. held nu
merous meetings In the Â¦woods and moun
. tain caves, where it was determined to
make another stand against the whites
who sought to wed their daughters. The
pull-back party was, organized and there
after figured prominently in all elections,
Â¦where they alwayj^ remembered to fight
the mixed breeds. :c~.''" '
The light between these two parties
was carried to 'Washington. Congress
an,d the President were made to believe
that the Indian girls were being sacrificed
to the greed of scheming whites, who
married, them, gained a headright and
then mistreated their wives. To some ex
tent this was true, but there were also
many happy marriages. Hurrdreds of
.white men built" happv homes' around
their Indian families, educated the race
and eveloneo* *ie land. The Indian
squaws' were trained in cookery and art.
They grew more civilized under their hus
band's tutorship.
But with an ear always open to Indians'
wrongs Congress decided to believe the
' fullbloods. Consequently, to ma** the
story of a long political struggle among
the Chickasaws short, when by subtle
and shrewd moves the fullbloods came In-
j the half-bloods already bad gained much
V. influence and they rejected that . radical
| measure. Finally a. bill, was agreed upon.
,' It was: '
"That all- non-cltlzens must reside in

years before they can procure a license
to marry a Chickasaw citizen: must be

yet. AH are more or less beautiful, well
educated and mild tempered. These girls
go to school and have a good education

1000 or mere full-blood girls waiting to
marry. It la these young women who
threaten trouble unless the Council re
peals the "atrocious act." Some of the
pretty quarter, and sixteenth part maid
ens openly declare they would rather
slave all their life for a white husband
than live in a tepee one month with a,
lazy rrdskin of their own blood. Says
Miss Emma Pickney, a pretty half-breed:
"I think I voice the sentiment of all the
girls of my race in saying thia high mar
riage license law is a scheme to keep us
from marrying. We aTe good enough and
can get husbands without our money, but
we don't intend to let our rights be tram
pled upon. I will marry a white man and
test this outrageous law. My husband
won't have to pay $1000 for a license,
either,"
A letter written by a high school girl
In the Bloamfield Seminary, a school for
Chickasaw jrjrls, says: "We all wonder
where this will end. Our sweethearts
- have suddenly deserted us and we sup
pose It is on account of that new law. I
had a nice young fellow for a sweetheart,
but he has gone. too. I suppose we must
die old maids now."
It Is well to note In this connection that
since March 2tJ to the present time not a
single marriage license has been applied
for, but during the month of February,
while the bill was pending. 1700 were is
sued to white men. No wonder thÂ» Chick
asaw maidens are *ad.
Connected with the enforcement of the
new ' law there were many amusing and
pathetic. Incidents. Ono particular case of
more than passing interest comes from
the little town of Paula Valley. Thula
Burns, a society belle of that little Indian
village, "was engaged to marry Will Mar
tin, a young white man employed In a
small store. Her parents were dead and
she lived with an aunt and provided for
herself upon the regular interest money
paid each citizen of the Chk'kasaw tribe.
Miss Burns was sure young Martin "loved
her for herself alone," because he bad
said as much. They were to have been
married In May and Thiila was busily en
gaged in making her wedding clothes
when news reached Pauls Valley that
marriage licenses had jumped to $W>0.
When Martin heard this startling news
he resigned and quit the f>wn, not even
stopping to bid hfs fiancee farewell. She is
lonely now. For she has lost faith In the
whJte3 and has no respect for her crwn
people. vr.
The full-blood girls left unwed are also
unanimous in denouncing tho. new law.
Three young women of Tishomingo, Lucy
Pushamata, Rosa Wayne and Ida Wild
Horse, are leadingUhe crusade against it.
All three of theses sirls want to marry
cowboys to whom they are engaged, but
who refuse to marry without the "head
right" or pay $1000 for a license. Thia is
Indian warfare up to date.
W. R. DlRAPER.
WAR is lmninent down !n the In
dian Territory. It Is not the
Sioux or : the Apaches this time,
but the civilized Chickasaws,
who are on the war path.
Neither is it Chiekasaw bucks who seek
the Wood of a white man. But five thou
sand young: women of that tribe, are hot
upon th<* trail of manâ any man, who
may be white and eligible. Latest reports
from the field state that the white men
are completely routed; some were cap
tured, but most of them fled. From those
who escaped it is learned that the true
cause of their flight was the fact that
they were mithout tlje price of a mar
riage license. This figure is enormous â
$1000. And that is the basis of all the
trouble.
Not until lately have marriage licensee
between Chickasaw women and Â¦white
men been quoted above $50. Consequently
with low prices and high values of Chick
asaw girls the market has
been rushed. It mi!?ht be called extra
ordinarily rushed, when you consider that
lT.irt weddings' took place in the Chickasaw
country in one month when there were
only *S'*i unmarried girls over eighteen
year* of age in the whole nation at that
time. But m-hen the new law charging
}iw Â»ach for marriage licenses went intc
fffpet on March 26 the matrimonial mar
ket dropped almost out of sight. Stock
is quoted way below par. with no pur
chasers on the floor. The Chickasaw girls
go about unnoticed: once they received
more attention than a new French count
at Newport.
When young women find their marriage
prospects hamj>ered they often create a
disturbance. These Indian maidens con
sider it a duty to go on the war path to
get redress. White men who have $1000,
no wife and who are susceptible to
charming beauties*, are, therefore warned
to be on the watch for Chickasaw girls.
They are after you and the lawmakers.
A* usual, from all this queer law.
charging such an enormous price for a
license to wed a dark-skinned and spark
ling-eyed beauty, there hangs a tale. It
is a queer tale. too. Much pathos at
taches itself to the story of the forma
tion of the anti-marriage act..
The Chtckaaawn have an ancient tradi
tion to the rffect that many moons afro,
under the guidance of a dog. they journey
ed from the far north, btlng pursued by
ferocious beasts. While crossing the
Mississippi River the dog was drowned
and the redskins wandered aimlessly
about until they settled. In Mississippi.
When the I'nited States authorities want
ed to settle Mississippi they drove the
Chiekasaw* out, claiming that they 1-ad
no right there. The. medicine men were
consulted before the Indians agreed to
leave peaceably. Then they decided to
come West, but to, punish the whites a
law or vow was taken by all the women
never to marry a pa'.ofaee or allow her
daughter to do so. As a consolation fund
the fnitod States paid the Chickasaws in
1SG4 $3.S46.000 for thefr Mississippi and
Georgia lands. In IS.T7. after many trials,
the Chickasaws reached tlu-ir new home
wrest of the Arkansas River. Here they
set up their tepees and resolved to stay

Moorea of this '. group is , the most
beautiful' spot that we -found ; in all - our
long voyage. â¢ Out. of a- deep blue water
the island rises In. sharp' steeps.' covered
to;. their very, tops with living green. If
Moorea could bo transplanted to 'a more
accessible spot it would: be an idealsum

are being laid out here and they bid fair

"While the ; Rover : was-Iving: at anchor
near this island a violent thunder-storm
came in the night. The lightning, was so
vivid that' one could read by: it. And then
the climate showed-what it could do. .For
next morning, not; a doud- was; in' the sky
and air and wntpr.were nhsolntplv calm.
From there a run was made to Raiatem.
where there was a rebellion, two y*>ar3
ago. In leaving Raiatea to reach Bora
Bora came one of the few exciting ad
ventures of the uulf;t. happy trip. In
beating her way out of the narrow pas
sage the yacht was nearly carried upon
the jagged rocks beside her. As her pas
sengers clung to the rigging and listened
In horror for the soi;:id of her copper bot
tom grating upon the rocks there came a
breeze like a miracle that gently bore her
out once more to safe waters. There had
been the moment when death was near
enough to see face to face.
At Bora Bora . we were enter
tained by another dance of natives, to
gether with a hymenc, as their songs are
called. This is their derivative from the
word hymn." which missionaries long
ago taught them. The next island visited
was Tupal: here some of our party went
ashore to find only a tiny uninhabited atoll
It has not always been uninhabited. OneÂ©
a man lived there, a man famous over all
the Islands. He was a Nova Scotian who
came to the South Seas to labor, not to
dream, and he raised pigs and sheep and
copra. He has left a numerous progeny
at Bora Bora, who are living now aa
leaders of men.
There were three rare sights In this
lonely Island. One was the huee land
crabs with shells like snail"? t Â£ be seen
crawling over the ground and even climb-
Ing the trees. Another was the hundreds
of sharks playing In the lagoon as gayly

catches her in the wild. race, overpowers
her and puts an end", to' her young life,

picture, "Joe's- Ship," which Is the' gem
of the exhibition, and there he â¢ receives
a shock from the dampness which his
weakened body cannot resist. .Death lays
claim to him who has wrought havoc in
an entire family and he goes to his end
unperturbed by his villainy.
Joe Noy. the discarded lover, returns
from his sea voyage, learns, of Joan's
tragedy and death, and determines- to
avenge it. He goes to London In search

Â¦ J, ..':'_â¢ "The Rhyrrjer."
Devout admirers of Robert Burns^will
be shocked as well as entertained by the
/ 'Â¦ - - - - ; -"- ; Â¦- Â¦ Â¦'
tlon; tne law of the diffusion of taxes;
the best methods of taxation.
S One of the most noteworthy problems
of ' our time Is the rapidity with' which
taxes Increase. Thus It is pointed out. by
Mr. Wells that half a century ago every
thinker predicted that the great 'evil of
democracy would Â¦ be meanness, that It
would: display an; ignorant impatience of
tnxation. and^ that it : -would refuse sup
plies necessary to tho dignity, or at least
to tho visible greatness, of a state: That
prediction has been. proven, not only by
tho United States but by that of Euro
pean countries, to be the exact contrary,
of the facts. As an English authority has
said: "The lower, the'" suffrage. the higher
tho. budget mounts. '/English . democracy
with household suffrage, though It has re
duced its debt, has increased its budget,
increased rates all/ over the country, and
"would not be frightened 'If to-morrow^ a
great socialistic experiment were to cost
it a hundred millions. Tho French dembc
racy has nearly doubled its. taxation, and
raised its debt more than a third, r The
German democracy has enlarged suffrage,
a poor soil and nearly universal poverty
is always granting new demands, whether
for soldiers, ships, colonle3 or centralized
officials."
It is, however, In the United States,
says Mr. Wells, with universal suffrage
and the richest of estates, that the ex
travagance, of government expenditures,
sustained' by taxation,;' rise \ to a. point
which fiscal experts like Hamilton, ; Walk
er and Gallatin in the United States, and
Pitt, Pcol and Ricardo in England; could
not have been persuaded, to believe pos
sible. ,
Since' taxes are thus : Increasing every
where In the civilized' world,* arid the
people appear willing to bear them so long
as they- aro : Justly levied,: it becomes in
the highest degree Important for/ legisla
tors to understand how and upon what
articles taxes should be laid so as to bring
the greatest amount of revenue .with the
least burden upon industry. â¢: To the solu-
ture but a pleasant memory. But for
her this love was to mold a life that had
known no change, no chance for develop
ment.
"Joe's Ship." as Barren's picture was
called, was finished, and the best thing
he had ever done. His deslreof Joan van
ished accordingly, and his energies were
soon exerted in ridding himself of an irk
some burden. He acted like a knave In
his deliberate love-making to this brain
less creature, who accepted his beliefs as
her creed, and like a coward in his flight
after his artistic demands had been -satis
fied. .
Upon his determination to leave he says,
"The chapter is ended. The chapter

I did, and. I suppose, the worst, as morals
have it. Yet Art happily risen above those
misty abstractions which we call right
and wrong." This closes the first book-
Art.
The second book â "Nature" â deals with
Joan's development, but in this It Is a
i Isappointment, for she never rises above
the commcnnlace.
I^eft alone with her secret, Joan kept
a stout heart during the days that fol
lowed, expecting dally the letter from
Barron that was to call her to â¢ him.
As time wore on she tried, hard to feel
the eame beautiful faith In nature; to re
ly on this new rell^on of Barron's^ for
help, but all seemed changed, and she
realized how much her lovq for him had
helped to make all things beautiful.
The chapter In which Joan goes to St.
Madron's Chapel Is too beautiful to go
Wt*.*MÂ«Ut notice. Her praver Is here given:
"KJn 1 rrot'e: o' the flowcs doan't 'e

an' loved me, bid. Oh, God A'mlghty

God, make. me well an' braavc agin, for
'tis awful wlsht for roe \vi*out Mister

be all in a miz-maze and doan't knaw

Oh. kind God A'mlghty. lemme have my

cheel. Oh, dear, good Godto' all things,
please help me an' look to me. 'cause I
be very cad," an' I nwr done no harm to
none, for Jesus Christ's sake. Amen."
It is with 'relief that we turn from the
hard. Inexorable type of Joan's father,
Gray Michael, who curses her and turns
her from his 'home when he learns 6t her
plight; to the simplicity of her Uncle
Chlrgwln. where she finds a temporary
home while she waits for the man whose
wife she believes herself to be.
As lime goes on and she receives no
word, nor confidence becomes shaken,
though she accuses herself of treachery
for the thought.
1 But at length she realizes that her ro
mance is a thing of the past; her knight
and philosopher a mere weakling, who
used his cleverness to entrap her.
She saw now that punishment must fol
low her search for higher things, but,
strange to say, she Is not filled with an
ger for the man who thus tore the veil
from her young eyes, but pity for herself.

to scan the horizon for a last glimpne of

John Barron. who, having heard of her
beauty, determines to .paint her and he
Cains her consent to became a model for
hiÂ« picture
He determines to make this painting his
masterpiece, and day after day finds him
at work with his beautiful model fast
awakening to the love that soon domin
ates her whole being.
He is not satisfied with the work, how
ever, and solves the problem In these
words: The countenance, he says, is that
of "a sweet virgin page of life. Innocent
of history or of Interest as a new-blown
lily â there is no flra, no love, no story."
There is but one solution and Barron
determines to so change the life of Joan
that he. may bring to her eyes and face
a depth of expression that will perfect
the picture.
And thus it Is that Mr. Phtllpotts takes
for his tale the old one of love and trust
and their betrayal.
The study of John . Barron is not a
pleasant one. He is a cynic and the acme
of selfishness, and in his attitude to Joan
Tregenza. he does not allow compunction
to color the brightness for him. Naturo
in his god and art his master, and they
nlone receive, consideration and thought.
As he considers Jean but a happy chance
thrown In his wayâ why not take It?
He wanted all that her loveliness could
give him. but for him she was but a
transitory longing, to become In the fu-
her uncle and cousin as a. means of peace,
but now, when the fact of her desertion
was apparent, she felt the awakening of
a faith that had been dormant since her
mother's death. She had tried man and
he had failed her; she had called on -her
saints and they had failed; and now,
through the simple words of her; uncle,
she Is led again to Christ. She turned to
religion as a drowning man would reach
for* a straw. Her eyes, shut so . long,
seemed opening at last to receive the wel
come picture of a real Godâ a being of
flesh and blood, who, too, had suffered and
saved her with his own life's blood.
Longing for a sight of home she goes
there, hoping for her father's forgive
ness, but only to be sent forth again with
a torrent of abuse hurled at her.
Poor Joan returns to her uncle's, where
she quietly abides, gaining what peace she
can from religion; and thus closes the sec
ond book, wherein one has looked for the
development In Joan's character that was
promised but not fulfilled.

sifted facts and theories with J a J view to
combining the best of bills into a* volume
which might serve as an account of ex
isting tax methods, and as an index or
guide to a better system. This work he
had virtually completed at the time of
his "death, "and it has Just beÂ«h published
by D. Appleton & Company, under the ti
tle, "The Theory and Practice of Taxa

From a prefatory note It is learned . the
author did not give any of the chapters
of the book their flnatform, and that It
Â¦was his Intention to have added consider
ably to those relating to the history of
taxation and to criticisms upon national
and -State tax problems. The closing
chapters are hardly more than sketches
of subjects with notes which the author
evidently Intended to use as arguments
and illustrations In developing them. Tne
editor announces that he has made few
changes in the text, and the work there
fore is Incomplete and not up to the stan
dard of that for which Mr. Wells Is noted.
Notwithstanding. the deficiencies of form,
the volume is a notable one and merits
the etudy of all who are interested In
subjects of taxation.
Among the more Interesting and Import
ant topics with which the work deals are:
Recent, tax experiments in the Federal
Government of the United States; tho
place of taxation in literature and his
tory; the definition, object and sphere of
taxation: the sphere of taxation peculiar
to the Federal Government of the United
States; rules or. maxims essential to an
administration of rightful taxation under
a constitutional or free government; ex

V. tho great European powers, may

wa? made by a Chinaman a year ago in
conversation with an Arpo r i rnn W (, n vaa
then- in China. The Society of Boxers
which now stands for latrlessneis rob
ber?- and murder, was once respectable
IT !s a good influence pone wronir. Origi
nal.y It was organized as a protest and a
means of defense against thÂ» bandits with
which the province of Shantung was in
fested. It was. In fact, a Law and Order
League.
At that time the life and property of no
honest man was snfe. The bandits were
not wild ruffiajiP, such as those of Italy
or the American West, but on the con
trary seemed to bÂ«Â» men of peace. By day
they tcUed a* choemakers. carpenters,
farmers and what not, but at night they
repaired to their strongholds in the moun
tains and from them made descents upon
villages in which any man was reported
to possevs a. Ftore of money worth the
having. A typical attack by these ban
dits was that made several years ago
upon onÂ© of the Shantung missions, of
which the Rev. J. H. I>aughlin. now in
* ew Tork. was a member. Other mem
bers were the Rev. R. H. Bent and Dr
J. L. Van Scnotck. They lived in three
houses all surrounded by a high wall.
The first evidence of trouble was a gun-
Fhot outside the gate, whereupon the
patekeeper poked out his head to see what
was the matter. Instantly a pistol was
shot eff in his face so that the powder
blinded him. although he received no
other wound.
The man fell shrieking to the ground,
and twenty-five bandits rushed over his
body and into the courtyard. Mr. Bent
taw them coming and retreated into his
cottage, but the robbers smashed in the
door and shot him in tho thieh. The mis
fiorary seized a piece of the splintered
door and ran out, striking right and left
on the pround. Th<* bandits had shat
tered !t with immense stones and then
pried it apart with crowbars. The amount
of money secured was small. .Sometimes
when the plunder does not equal their ex
pectations they Â«eize the person of one of
thÂ«Â»ir victim's, blindfold him. load him
about in a circle and at last carry him off
to the mountains, from where they send
messages demanding a ransom.
It was such attacks as this, repeated
over and over again in villages through
out the province, that resulted in the or
ganization of the Boxers. But they were
not called Boxers then. Tlwir name was
Ta Tao Hwel.. which means "The Society
of the Great Sword." More recent is the
name Universal Society of Boxers, but
the change signifies little; in fact, change
of name among secret societies is fre
quent. One name is kept until an edict
of suppression is issued against it. and
then a new name is adopted, and the
society goes on as if nothing had hap
pened.
Christians do not know just when the
Society of the Great Sword had its ori
gin. The natives refer to it as an "an
cient" society, but that may mean ten
years or a hundred. It Is agreed, how
ever, that at first its principles were
laudable and its work good, but as it be
came more powerful and Increased In
numbers many dishonest and designing
persons entered it for the prestige and
protection it afforded, just as dishonest
and designing persons ally themselves
with influential bodies in other lands to
day. These men proved a disturbing ele
ment, and in many cases directed the ef
forts of the society against their personal
enemies, whom they represented as ban
dits and lawless persons.
Some of these victims, it is said, terri
fied by the persecution of the Grea<
Svrord Society, looked for some othe-'
force from which they might hope for
protection, and found It In the Christian
missionaries, and especially the German
Catholics. These men professed conver
sion, and besought succor, and the mis
sionaries used every endeavor to secure
tlon which they did not altogether de
serve. This condition intensified the feel-
Ing which has always existed against thl
missionaries.
This feeling grows to some extent out
of the general contempt with which thÂ«
Chinese regard foreigners. The Chinese
literary class are keen critics and give
close scrutiny to the teachings of the
Christian Bible. They confess to the
beauty of its moral- teachings, but can
not see in what they are superior to those
of Confucius. They also notice the ac
â¢ counts of the miracles in the Old Testa
1 ment. and say that the Chinese legend
â¢ of the moon being eaten by a dragon is
! not much more unreasonable than thÂ«
; Bible story of how Joshua compelled the
sun to stand still. They choose to regard
1 Christianity as "a wave of darkness."
In order to overcome this feeling the
missionaries have in most cases adopted
Chinese dress. But Chinese ideas of pro
priety are the most straitlaced in the
world, and the missionaries, despite their
native attire, have not always been able
to live up to them. This has* been espe
; clally true of the women, whose Western
freedom of action bas been shocking to
1 the natives, although quite correct from
our point of view, j Evpry effort has been
' made by the missionaries to adapt them
selves to local conditions?, but in China
first impressions can rarely be eradicated,
and complaints made against the early
' Catholic missionaries, two centuries ago,
are quoted against their successors of to
day.
' This hatred of Christianity among the
literary class finds expression in thÂ° most
shockinpr slanders, which are constantly
circulated In ordtr to keep alive the hatred
of the masses. For the name of God the
Catholics have adopted the word' Tier

THE "BOXERS" OF CHINA
cated Chinaman Is willing to laugh at
Buddhism or Taoism, but reverence for
his ancestors Is one of the passions of his
life. One may call a native Chinaman all
the bad names in the vocabulary, and he
may not resent it: but a word against his
ancestors will arouse his most vindictive
fury. When a man dies in China his son
prepares a wooden tablet resembling a
small headstone, which Is elaborately dec
orated and marked with the words, "Shen
Chu." meaning "Spirit Lord,"" and "Shen
Wei." meaning "Spirit Throne." This is
set up beside the coffin, but there Is one
dot absent in the word "Chu" and one in

makes an offering before it. Then it is
placed ln v a shrine with the- tablets of hl3
other ancestors- and in common with,
them is reverenced^ at various times dur
ing the year. '-..-. '
There has always been a question as to
whether this practice is Idolatrous or
merely reverentialâ whether it la religious
or merely social, and had the early mis
sionaries been willing to accept it all Chi
na might possibly have been Christian, or
at least quasi-Christian, to-day; but tho
Pope, after some hesitation, pronounced
against it and the Protestant churches
have followed suit, and It has remained
ever since a practically Insurmountable
barrier between the two peoples.
About ten years aso the missionaries
iad enjoyed peace for some time and re
garded the future as full of hope, but on
May 10. 1591. two nuns, who were going
home from a visit to some sick people.
,were maltreated by a mob, who charged
them with bewitching children. The mis
sion houses were plundered, and this was
the signal for the renewal of the disturb
ances all through China. These became
worse and worse, exciting -more and morÂ«
resentment in Kurope, until, at last. soraÂ«
German priests were murdered and the
mission looted In Shantung. This was' fol
lowed by the seizure Wy the Germans of,
the port of Tsin Tau.
The Shantung Chinese connected these
two events and swore vengeance^ on thÂ«
Germans, and incidentally upon all for
eigners and Christians, it was at this time
that the Great Sword Society began to
make Itself obnoxious.
They had previously been proscribed i>y
the Government for local reasons and.
temporarily suppressed, but now they be
came bolder than ever and inaugurated a
reign of terror throughout Shantung. Na
tive Christians were robbed, beaten and
murdered, and their houses destroyed.
Many .of them were forced to recant and
some of the chapels were looted, but no
missionaries were killed. So hold was the
action of the society and so flagrant their
outrages that Yu Hsien. the Governor oC

Into anarchy at once, and the track of
ruin was widespread. In many counties
of Shantung, every Roman Catholic
homo was swept clean, and hundred* of
Protestant Christians suffered. In re
sponse to appeals from the missionaries
the miscreant Yu was suddenly removed
and the famous Yuan Shih K'al. a friend
of LI Hung Chang, was sent to be the
Governor. .
But before the authorities of ChthH
could be made to realize the real Import
of the struggle one hundred Protestant
families had b*Â»en looted on the borders
of the Yellow River, west of the provin
cial caoltal. An equal number of Chris
tians of the London mission in Chihll had
suffered, and fifty or more Congrega
tional families had been attacked, de
spoiled or mulcted of money under
threats of loot and plllasre. The "most se
rious of these were at Chansr-Ssu-Ma. In
Chihll. and Ho-Chia-Tun. in Sh&ntun?.

Pirnitz turned toward Mile, de Sainte-

"What does that mean?"
Tho old lady appeared still more shriv

Her face, generally so pale, had become

soothingly, with her thick Alsatian ac

The Invalid made a sign of acquiescence.

head the apostle murmured: * â¢ *Â¦ Â¦
"My poor child! I think a period of

"A period of great trialâ great trial?"
Tho words echoed and re-echoed in Lea's
mind. They seemed to ring In her ears
as she waiked to and fro with measured
steps across the landing and the little

'Poor child!"
L^a's eyes tilled with tears. But at that
moment the door on the other side of the
landing opened and they saw the Invalid
app"ear. carried In her portable armenair.
Sister Odile holding it in. front. Maria be
hind. This odd procession crossed the
landing and stopped in the empire salon.
I>ea and PImltz wee and approached tho
old lady, who seemed all shriveled up In
her black garments and Chantllly lace
headdress, an effect that was accentuat
ed by her disproportionately large visage,
in which two keen little gray eyes glit
tered and sparkled.
"There!" she said, when they put down
her chair. "Give me a cushion for my
feet, Odile. That will do! I am not very
well, dear Pirnitz. not at all Wfcll! Run
away, Maria! You tire : me; â¢ you chatter
too much. Sit down there near the win
dow, Odile. What we have to say does not
concern you. Come closer to me, Pirnitz,
and speak very clearly. I had to take some
salicylate this morning and it has given
me a sort of humming in my ears."
Pirnitz drew up her chair before the
portable armchair. \
"And you, also, little Lea; don't stop so
far away. Give me your hands and let
me look at you. Aa beautiful as daylight,
"Well. I'll tell you." said Maria, leaning,
without any ceremony, upon the round ta
bl<Â«. "Mademoiselle isn't very ill, for sho.
cats and drirks as usual, and she can
move her arms as well as ever, poor dear!
As for her legs, she lost the use of the:n
twenty years ago. Ah! but it makes me
s=orry to see her no longer cheerful and
contented, as the used to be. You knew
hf-r. Mile. Romaine? How she made us
swear, poor Sister Odile and me! She
would change her mind a hundred times a
minute! It was 'Maria, bring me some hot
wine'.' 'Maria, serve dinner half an hour
earlier!' 'Maria, fetch me a guinea fowl
for dinner this evening!' 'Maria, come out
of your everlasting kitchen to tnlk to me!'
Poor thing! And Sister Odile! She would
make hor changeethe book -she was read
ing ten times an hour! But now every
thing is right. She is satisfied with any
thing. The poor lady does not scold us
any more. 'Yes. Marie, that will do,' "
and the fat servant assumed a little plain
tive voice to Imitate her mistress. "Yes.
Sister Odile. do what you like!' I may
overcook the roast or forget the garlic In
the sauceâ she will never notice it! She
wakens up a Uttle when any one speaks
of your school or when she is wltn that
Michel! Ah. when she's with lltiie Michel
she's Just as she was before. And they
talk! they talk! It's quotations here and
London Stock Exchange there, the bank
reports and margins! You would think
they were two Jews talking! Of course
Michel has helped madamoiselle to a lot of
money."? added Marie, pensively. ."And to
think' that he wanted to invest my sav
ings! He said tn me the other week, "If
you had followed my advice. Maria, you
would have had fifty thousand francs of
your own now.' "
Lea and Pirnitz smiled at this deluge
of words, for Maria did not even take
tim*- to breathe between her sentences.
"Maaemois^lle's business affairs are go
ing along riyht. are they not, Maria?"
asked Pirnitz.
"I don't know!" replied the fat cook.
"Not too well. I'm afraid. Ah! there she
goes! She's ringing for me."
Leaving her visitors abruptly she ran
to the other side of the landing, where
was Mille. de Salnte-Parade's room. It
was from this room that she had rung
for Maria. A "big bfll, hanging from a
spiral in a corner of the ceiling, t was still
oscilliatinjr.
Lea and Pirnitz waited a little while for
a summons. They saw Michel, with his
sacristan's air, a thin little man, with a
stoop, come, out of the room. When ho
perceived Pirnitz and Lea he stopped for
a second. The id^a of speaking to them
appeared to cross bis mind. He, however,
only saluted them, turned around quickly
and sped down the staircase like a weasel.
The minutes passed again, measured out
by the pendulum of a big clock situated
on the upper floor. In the silence it pul
sated like the heart of the house. With
her gaze tixed on. the faded tracery of an
Aubusson carpet which covered the- floor
of the empire room. Lea realized w.ith
anguish that she felt like an Intruder
there â like some one perfectly indifferent
to c-vervthing, just as at the school. She
tried in vain to think seriously of Mile,
de Sainte-Parade's financial embarrass
ment and health. She dared not speak,
and avoided Plrnitz's glanceâ Pirnitz,
whom she Btill loved, but whom aho
wished at times she might cease to love,
so that she might be perfectly free. Ilka
Nora in Tinka's novel, or like Duyvecke
Hespel.
With an abrupt, almost Involuntary,
movement she turned to Pirnitz and kissed
her shoulder. Pirnitz looked at her w.th
her beautiful, magnetic eyes and niur
murefl;
"How is mademoiselle?" asked Lea
"I? he there, Mllo. Romaine?*-' cried the
Gascon, recovering hor natural tono and
Southern volubility. "Don't you know he
lives here now? fie comes In the morn
ing carl;:, when mademoiselle is still in
bod, and then again after the Bourse, and
In tho evening, after supper, mademoiselle
sometimes asks for him to give him or
der?. s<> she says! Ah! upon my word'
Little Michel is always going up or down
the st.ilrs!"
"Ah. Michel Is there?" asked Pirnitz,
sitting down upon the sofa, where Lea
also took a place by her side.
When she had uttered this phrase Maria
waited pointedly instead of polnp away,
evidently hoping they would question her.
"If you would be kind enough to take
breath until mademoiselle has finished
with M. Michel "
Maria, very loquaÂ«:ioua by nature, ob
served a. mo-n unusual silence that day.
She gmply ?aid, in a little squeaking fal
setto that f=he adopted upon serious occa
sions, for she spoke generally in a very
loud voice, with jilcturesque fluency:
In the meanwhile Maria, the fat Gascon
servant, led the two visitors Into a sort
of paion anteroom, with its wide ope.i
doors giving en the landing of the iirst
rlocr. It was furnished with a sofa and
four empire? armchairs, covered with
green velvet. The backs of the chairs
were decorated with a triangular pedi
ment and dolphins' head3 formed the
arms'. A round marble-topped table stood
in the center of the room.
"Have courage; dearest," paid Pernltz,
the bolder spirit of' the two. to Lea. "Do
not give up at the moment when we have
moft nee<l of you."
Lea realized that Fhe was thinking of
Puyveokc, the lirst defection from the
ranks of the sacred band of evangelists;
Duyveoke. who was leaving the work to
make a banal marriage, and who wus so
humble and fo gentle in rpite of her de
sertion that no one could be angry with
her.
ed a faded green, which was so long in
opening. It was the end of the Paris
luncheon hour. A keen east wind had risen
after the recent storm and swt'pt along
the almost deserted Hue de Grenelle. im
parting a touch of freshness to the atmos
phere of that June afiernoon. The skirts
<if the two women clung around their
legs, while they had to clutch the brims
of their hats to keep them upon their
hends. The wind seemed to spend its en
ergy upon a piece of newspaper that It
had chafed into the corner of the gate
way. Pirnitz rang again.
"I know what you are thinking of, she
said to her companion.
"Ves." replied Lea. "It Is not yet three
years ago! Vet how I seem to have aged
since that day!" _
The door moved at last and opened. The
two women, greeted by a lodge keeper of
ecclesiastical aspect, crossed the yard,
with its â¢ b!g moss-covered pavement,
strewn with fragments of columns and
Corinthian capitals. They went up the
steps in the right hand corner, protected
by a zinc portico. They, did not speak.
They were both lost in memories of that
Sunday In April, less than three years ago,
wlun Plrnitz had led Frederique and Lea,
quivering with emotion and curiosity, to-
Mile, ile Salme-Parade's, to present them
to the feminist group.
The worii then was only a project, a
port of chimera. Frederique and Lea
then hoped with all their heart to follow
thi- life of a teacher anci an apostle.
And now the school existed and was
fiouri^hi-.:?. A marvelous combination of
circumstances had enabled them to con
struct it. to organize it, in a relatively
short space of time. Lea was now a par
ticipant in an admirable attempt to se
cure the emancipation of weman.
Yet the two frionds did .not exchange a
sinple glance of Â¦ triumph while Kolng up
the stopf leading to the door and follow
ing a stout servant wearing a Gascon
handkerchief wound around her hair,
across* the vestibule, with its status of
St. Anthony of Padua, and up the pol
ished wood staircase with its bordered
carpet. The nervous sadness of that
windy day and melancholy presentiments
subdued them both.
"Ah, yes. . I wanted to see you In par
ticular. " Heurteau demoralizes me. Every
thing is lost straight away with her. We
have only to pack up our luggage and es
tablish Anquetln. Duramberty. Quignon
net. the Abbe Minot and the Minister of
Public Instruction in our school. accord-
Ing to her. She has been bothering me
about on article."
"Whatâ the article In the Semaine de St.
Charles? Have you read It?"
"No! and I won't read it! What does It
matter even if a "gutter sheet does slander
us? They are in the same trade, the peo
ple who are attacking us. They see that
our reopening next year Is going to be a
very brilliant affair. But you don't say
anything, either of you! You sit there on
upon mv word, but what a sad air you
have! I "don't like melancholy people, and
for some time I have had no luck! iou
all look as though you were at a funeral."
She let po Lea's hand and the girl sat
down, keeping back her tears with an ef
fort. . ,,
"Well, Pirnitz, what have you Â¦ to tell
me?"
"Why." said Pirnitz, with her tranquil
voice, "It was you who asked us to come,
mademoiselle."
"No. that's not . Frederique's opinion.
She suggests economy and diminution of
expenditure. In the first place, she has
cut off the salaries of the mistresses for
the current year. We have agreed to this.
That is an. economy of 8400 francs. She
has shown us how. about 11.000 francs can
be saved upon the general Qutlay, regard-
"All these nervous 'creatures lost their
heads: but luckily Mile. Pirnitz, - Freder
ique and L managed to recover control of
the flock again, and then we set our wits
to work to find a way of avoiding ruin."
"I. am rather curious., to know what
means you found." - *
. "I did not discover any; I tell you. It
was FrederiqHe who found a way out of
the. difficulty."
"In that case It Is sure to be both In
genious and practicable."
"Well, first of all. Frederique laid before
us . the exact financial situation of the
schbol. The day before the catastrophe
It was â¢ very satisfactory. ! Our expenses
are not so heavy as people think. We
have no rent to pay., thanks to you. We
have some very onerous demands upon
our resources, but, again, thanks to you,
as your machines work our dynamos for
a very small sum. The lighting of the
school Is very cheapâ 2600 francs. The act
ual cost of the school servants is reduced
to a minimum, for, as in the barracks,
the pupils do everything except the really
heavy work. .We haven't more than 2000
francs to pay yearly In wages.- The heav
iest outlay Is food and clothing for non
paying pupils, an expense of about 25.000
or 26,000 francs a year. Last year we only
had three paying pupils at 500 francs each.
Mile, de Sainte-Parade paid the difference
plus the mistresses' salaries. They are
very small, you knowâ 1200 francs each.
If you include the costof the scholastic
material. Mile. .de Sainte-Parade had to
find a balance of about CO.0OO francs "
"It's not much." Interrupted Duram
berty. "I should have wagered she paid
80.000 francs at the least. I know, of
course, that your 1 affairs are admirably
managed. However, continue."
He leaned back in his armchair, really
interested.
"This sum of 50,000 francs now falls us,"
Mile. Heurteau continued.
"And consequently you have only to lay
down your arms and bow to the force of
circumstances"
"Naturally."
"Several of the foundressesâ In fact. the
most nervous; like Lea Surler, Daisy
Craggs. little Germalne Soublzeâ "
"Germaino Soublze? A slender, red
haired girl, is she not?" Interrupted the
manufacturer.
"Yes, the girl with fine red hair, blj?
greenish eyes and graceful in her bearing
and movements,. but impressionable to ex
cess. She has all sorts of manias, of
fancies, Â¦ a legacy of alcoholism and neu
rasthenia. I even suspect that she suffers
from very serious hysterical paroxysms,
which Daisy hides from ns."
- "She is pretty," .said Duramberty.
"Well, go on." -. Â¦
"It is not my plan, strictly speaking,"
she said at last. "I have not even helped
to draw it up. I have simply attended
the meetings necessitated by the ruin
and paralysis of our benefactress. Each
member of the committee gave her opin
ion as to what ought to be done, and that
of Mile. Frederique Surler obtained the
strongest support." Â¦
"Indeed? Is It Mile. Surler who sent
you to me?"
"Perhaps I ought not to answer." con
tinued the young woman, a smile flicker
ing In her eyes. "It seems to me, how
ever, that It is better to be quite frank
with you."
"Yes; you will not regret It."
"Very well. This Is exactly how matters
stand. The news that Mile, de Sainte-
Parade Is ruined nnd smitten down with
out hope of cure filled every one with con
sternation at first."
Mile. Heurteau, dressed in black and
wearing the bonnet with pink roses that
she affected as a sort of Invariable uni
form, was sitting before him In the very
place where three years before Frederique
Surler had listened with a stupefaction
that soon turned, to indignation to Du
ramberty's proposalâ advanced like an or
dinary business affairâ like a contract of
partnership â that she . become his mis
tress. The former -teacher's face wore a
meditative look as she reflected for a few
seconds before replying.
CHAPTER II.
"So you are not going to give up? What
Is your plan?"
Jude Duramberty's lip curled ironically
as he uttered these words. leaning back
in his leather armchair and looking the
lady to whom he was speaking straight
in the face.
"Oh. It will improve a little, but I fear
that a!! Is over so far as the brain la
concerned! But life, animal existence,
may last for a long time yet."
Sister Odile turned toward Pirnitz and
said peaceably: . Â¦ Â¦
"You see! It is exactly as I thought."
Bowing to Sister Odile. the doctor walk
ed up to the bed. raised the lnx'alld's arm,
touched her legs, listened to her breath
ing, examined attentively her eyeballs
and- then. . leading the nun toward the
window, where Pirnitz and Lea were
â¢awaiting the result of Mis observations,
he said: , .
"Well, sister, â¢> the attack I have feared
for about a" month has occurred! Hemi
plegia! All the- right side Is paralyzed."
"Incurably?" asked Pirnitz. â¢
Pirnitz made a perplexed gesture. The
doctor, a tall, robust, fresh colored man.
with a flowing brown beard, came in at
that moment. Behind him. framed In the
df.oiway, could be seen Marie and the
h tfgekeeper's family.
"Wha'. are we to do?"
"Michel says that when this house has
been sold there Â¦will remain about one hun
dred arrl forty thousand francs. Mile. c!e
Sainte-Parade will be able to live upon
that in a convent; but the Work is
ruined."
"Is it complete ruin?"
"Yes It appears he did some business
with Michel and enga<ed him willfully in
a very ruinous affair."
"But what have the people of Kt.
Charles against uÂ«?"
"They are simply men and Irritated by
our Independence. That is sufficient. As
for Michel. I believe he is sincere. In spite
of his pettifogging sexton's appearance. I
was very much touched by the fact that,
although he knew of the ruin for the last
two days, he had not dared to tell Mile,
do Salnte-Parnde of it. 'I came every
mornins? to tell her." he said, 'and then
when I was with her 1 lost all my cour
age. I told her one tale after another that
she was winning vast sums in pounds
ster.'ing: that copper was rising, and 1
went away again without telling her!
Then when I saw you the Idea occurred
to rne to tell you the whole affair.' "
"Pater Noster." broke in the high
pitched voice of Sister Odile. The beads
of her rosary clicked one against the
other.
and a crucifix hanging on her bosom.
"She is happy! She is not anxious! She
is Ignorant of all that tempts the heart of
a woman! Even if, owing to the Impossi
ble circumstances, she were to transgress
she would find a refuge in prayer. I have
relied too much upon my intelligence.
What has become, of the time when I
C Â°Pirnnzf y whoJ>e ' penetrating eyes were
watching Lea. divined what thoughts^were
agitating her. Lea felt her hand taken
prisoner by the slender, soft hand of her
companion, and while Sister Odile. who
had now laid down her little flask, was
delicately soothing the Invalid by a 'gentle
massage; Pirnitz said to the girl in a half
whisper: '-'"'., ,
"Yes her task I* also a noble one. and
her Hfe is beautiful. But ours Is more
beautiful still, Lea. Sister Odile Is a saint
without halo, so to speak. Her virtue is
selfish, and. besides, such virtue la com
patible with the subjection of woman. It
recognizes such subjection and recom
mends It. Let us rejoice that we arp as
devoted and as pure as she is. and free,
which she Is not! Let us glory in the lderi
that we renew our vows every moment or
our life: that we are our own mistresses
at every moment; that we are victorious
over ourselves." Â¦ ' _ '
Sister O<li!e. probably realizing that any
further attention was quite superfluous for
the present, sat down be-lde the invalid s
bed without speaking and calmly began
to tell her beads. Lea and Pirnitz with
drew discreetly to the window and drew
their chairs close together. The window
opened upon the inner courtyard or the
house. The wind swept up the dust in
clouds ami whirled round in eddies some
pieces of paper and some leaves fallen
from the trees. They saw the big ser
vant Maria standing In the arched en
trance, talking and gesticulating with the
lodErekeenor's wife. They were wnUincr
and watching for the arrival of the doctor,
whom the porter had gone to summon.
In the room a bright summer afternoon
sunlight shone uporr the polished furni
ture.upon the red chintz with its Indians.
The foot of th<* Louis XVI hid the motion
less body of Mile de Sainte-Parade from
Loa and Pirnitz. No sound could be hearÂ«l
except the moaning of the wind In the
corridor?, staircases and garrets of the
old mansion, and the lisping murmur of
tho nun telling off the Ave and Gloria.
"What had Michel to tell you?' asked

"He is n very strange creature, replica
Pirnitz. "He seemed really contrite, and

And of all those who nourished hatred for

"Good day, mademoiselle!"
And. while she was going down the

"Good day, sir!"
Mile. Heurteau and Duramherty stood
for a moment face to face, their gazes riv
eted, so to speak, upon each other. It was
manifest that he wished to add some
thing, to come to an understanding to
exchange a promise In return for a prom
ise. But In spite of his accustomed self
possession the astute impassibility of
Mile. Heurteau topped him. It was sho
who .took leave of him.
"I will tell her."
.."Just another word," he said with a
little confusion. "As it is Mile. Fred
erique who has taken the initiative* in tho
measures adopted by your committee,
would it not be .well that I should see her?
Oh! not here! â not here! At the school!
In your home! "Would she not receive me?
You don't see anything extraordinary in
the idea, do you?"
The former teacher's face betrayed no
surprise.
"Not the least." she replied.
"The fact Is." continued the manufac
turer, troubled in spite of all his efforts
not to betray any, "I should like a private
Interview. I should not care for any one
to be present; it would both annoy and
embarrass me. 1 ,'
"I can propose the idea to Frederique."
"I rely upon you to make Mile. Surler

the interest of your work; isn't that so?
Try to succeed."
"I will do my best." replied Mile. Heur

"What would be the best time?"
"Frederique has no lessons to-morrow

"Very well, you will be good enough to
say that I will call to-morrow about 4
o'clock unless I receive a note from her to
the contrary." â¢
"No. I must look into the matter. I
must talk with the representative of Mile,
de Salnte-Parade's creditors and ask the
advice of my lawyer. If the affair Is
worth it. I msÂ»v begin a lawsuit. In that
case it will be so much capital saved for
Mile. Sainte-Parade."
He appeared to hesitate about continu
ing. Mile. Heurteau, without replying,
walked to the door. He detained her for
a moment.
"So I cannot take back any decided
answer as to what your Intentions are
with regard to us in case your security
be seized?" she asked.
Heurteau arose.
"I must think the- matter over." he
said, leaning with one hand upon hJs desk.
"In any case, I thank you for your con
fidence In me. I shall not forget It. Ah!
if all your colleagues would only follow
your example!"
"What do you mean?" he asked.
"Well, when you transferred to us the
ground that is the site of our school you
were good enough to do it without asking
for any ready money. But you Insisted
upon a deposit of 300.000 francs as security.
The Interest upon this sum was drawn by
Mile, de Sainte-Parade. Unfortunately, in
spite of Frederique's effort!*â for Freder
ique had feared a catastrophe for a long
time â the poor old lady could never mako
up her mind to take jhe necessary precau
tions to prevent the seizure of this se
curity, and her creditors now demand that
these 300.000 francs be put to her assets for
the payment of her liabilities."
"It is not certain that they have the
right -to do so. I am also a creditor.
They cannot touch my security."
"Which simply means a possible law
suit betwen you and the creditors. It Is
certain that they are going to seize the
security and if it is <we want to know
Â¦whether you - will call upon us to re
place it?"
Jude Duramberty did not reply. He
arose, walked acrdss the whole length of
his office, went to look through the win
dow which opened on the courtyard of tho
school and returned to his seat. Mile.
Heurteau sat waiting.
"Ah! that Is the poir.t of the whole af
fair. You don't know all our embarrass
ments. Or perhaps you suspect?"
Duramberty returned the forms to th*
clerk, who bowed and went out.
"Still, as you are going to maintain the
status quo In your establishment, to what
do I owe the pleasure of your visit?"
At this moment a clerk knocked at the
door, came in and hanfled several printed
forma to the manufacturer for his signa
ture. "While writing. Duramberty asked:
"I think that we have been slandered.
Still, I regret any useless exaggeration. Of

that complete Independence Js impossible,

I think it is better to live as a municipal
establishment than to live a3 a free school.
But my opinion is of no value, as no one
listens to it."
"I understand." replied Duramberty. "I
know how jealous of their independence

They have carried It to a ridimlous ex
cess, even to the point of refusing the
municipal grant for prizes and of forbid

Abbe Minot complains that you treat him

you who are so sensible?"
"Why?"
"Because In our school they dread the
interference of public officials like a child

your chairs like pictures of fate! Are we
going to have a brilliant opening, yes or
nor Heurteau has shown me the list.
Why, there are more than twenty paying
pupils!"
"i*fs," replied Lea mechanically, "the
reopening promises to be very good."
"Well:" cried the old lady, "what did I
tell you? We can afford to let those
church mice gossip! The day we care to
reply to them we can do It in another pa
per, that is all! I am sure Heurteau will
be able to' draw up an article when we
want one. Don't you agree with me, Pir
nitz?" she added, looking at the apostle
with her little anxious eyes. In which
could be read the infantile desire for an
encouraging answer.
"Well. I must say," replied Pirnitz,
"that I'm of your opinion, my dear friend.
There is nothing very dangerous in the
affair. Nevertheless, It might perhaps
be wise to prevent a recommencement of
hostilities by some official measure. The
pupils have heard from conversations at
noire that the Abbe Minot intends to keep
up the flght. In all probability his paper
will have an article next about Duy
vecke's resignation, and you can see how
much profit can be made out of it by dis
torting the facts and interpreting them
malevolently."
"What a monster that Abbe is! And to
think that I used to confess to him! That
I helped his hospital in Grenelle! . I'll go
and hunt him up. and we shall see what
he has got to say for himself. I'll tell
himâ"
She could not think what she was going
to tell him. so she shook her head and
gesticulated with her hands.
"Exactly, mademoiselleT" continued Pir
nitz, gently. "I believe It would be a very,
good idea if you could see the Abbe Minot,
either at his house or here. You would
certainly win him over." - .
"Really? Do you think so?" cried Mile,
de Sainte-Parade, quick to change and to
catch at a hope. "If I were only sure!
But to have such a rascal come here!
Well, I will think It over. I'll write to him.
Yes, I'll write to him this very day, In a
few moments. After all, we got along
very well together. I He did not seem to
be a man with whom It would be hard to
come to an understanding! As for hjs pri
vate life, he Is a saint. Oh! on that score
there Is no doubt possible. r The Abbe Mi
not Is really a jsalnt!"
She suddenly realized the contradiction
contained in her speech, and stopped, con
fused by the surprise which she read in
her visitors' eyes. She threw back- the
ends of her laco mantillaâ a gesture that
was habitual with herâ and suddenly
changed the subject, speaking In a grave
tone.
"And what about Duyvecke? Who could
have believed such a thing, Pirnitz? A'
girl who had lived among us for four
years! I would have given her the sacra
ment without' confession. I had complete
confidence in her. Ah! it was a really
great shock tome: I have not .recovered
from it even yet. It was just as though â
aa- thoughâ well, as though it were you.
Lea, who had left us to gad about with a
man. Why, my dear child, what is. the
matter? I did not want to wound your,
feelings! Don't weep! Come, come, I know
you are a little marvel, a genuine embryo
apostle. Come, my dear, child; don't weep,
don't weep."
Her clumsy ailing hands patted Lea on
the knee, and Lea, who had been touched
to the heart by her last. sentence, stam
mered:
"It's nothing; I assure you, it's nothing.
Forgive me, mademoiselle, I'm rather
nervous this morning."
"She was so fond of Duyvecke," said
Pirnitz, as a sort of excuse.
"Whc is the man Duyvecke Is going to
marry?" asked Mile, de Sainte-Parade.
"Ah,. yes, I remember, It's that Reml
neau, who came here several times a
couple of years ago to look over the build
er's acounts. He's an ordinary workman.
Isn't he? Well, it's nice to think of a man
like that falling in love with Duyvecke.
She has shown good taste! She must be
a loose, creature in spite of her innocent
air."' .- Â¦-;-. . . , - . Â¦ -
"Oh, mademoiselle!" said Lea.
"Whyi'-doyou excuse her?" . .
"I am certain, mademoiselle," replied
Lea' with a little warmth, "that Duyvecke
left us 'with a sad heart. But she wor

she Is guided | by. a . pure maternal senti

surpassed reality, and mingled with the
characters of Tinka's book, which she
had read again feverishly several times
since, she had received it. - Lea's fears
conjured up the figure of a man. tall, very
thin, with sea green eyes and a fair,
drooping mustache. He was seated in a
chair, bowed with care, his forehead rest
ing on hia head and dying
"Georg!" Lea sighed. -"Oh, I must write
to Tinka!"
fcne was haunted by ti.e projectâ to
know whether Georg was really ill.
whether, like William In the story,, he
were dying on account of his beloved's ab
sence!
Possessed. by the pictures of her imag
ination she awoke with a start when Pir r
nitz returned, but a tender emotion im
mediately drove away from her all selfish
thoughts. . Lea saw something she "had
never seen before â tears in the apostle's
eyes. The somber silhouette â¢ of. Pirnitz
standing at the door of the salon did not
move. Her wasted hands were hanging
along her black skirt and down herde
liciously ugly face tears were flowing
slowly. Lea ran.. took the beloved head
between her Ijamls and kissed it, and her
lips tasted the bitter tears upon the cheeks
of a waxiike pallor.
"Romaine! Dearest! My dear friend!
What Is the matter! Toll mo! Tell me!"
Pirnitz freed herself gently and, with
out any false modesty wiped away her
tears.
"It is really the trial that Is beginning,
my dear: a hard trial! The school is
ruined!- Mile, de Sainte-Parade has specu
lated and has lost!"
"Lost everything?"
"No one knows yet; but the little that
she has left will certainly be noÂ«more than
Just sufficient for hor to live upon. What
will my poor little girls do?"
She no longer wept, but remained stand
ing lest in thought. She spoke in an un
moved tone so difflerent from her usual
voice and her attitude was so changed
that no noisy demonstration of human
suffering could have been more touching.
Lea was quite shocked and frightened by
the sight of her who 1 was her firmest sup
port In -life, no full of despair.
"Komaine." she murmured. "I pray you,
do not weep! Do not despair! If you lose
hope what shall I do?"
The apostle smiled at this touching cry
of egoism.
"You are right." she said. "I am not
alone in the world. We will light."
At that moment Maria ran precipitately
out of her mistress' room and came roll-
Ing along with silent footsteps to the two
women.
"Mademoiselle is ill! Come quickly! She
is asking for you!"
In the tempest of terror that monetary
catastrophes unchain in any household.
Lea and Pirnitz followed Maria hastily
without asking for an explanation and
went after her Into Mile, de Sainte-Pa
rade's bedroom, furnished with Louis XVI
furniture, recovered with old chintz
urfnted with red designs showing Groups
"Do you think so?" asked Mile, de
Sainte-Parade.
A few moments of silence followed.
This grave problem of maternal duty, the
hereditary, obscure duty "that cannot be
shaken off. causes a vague fear to ad
vanced feminists, troubles and almost ir-'
ritates them. Neither Lea, nor Pirnitz,
nor Mile. Sainte-Parade;- nor even Sister
Odile could hoar the appeal without her
heart throbbing painfully, for the word
"motherhood" thrills the most sacred
fibers of a woman. After Lea's words not
one of the other three dared say, "Duy
vecko is inexcusable."
Then in the singular silence, during
which the clock divided the seconds regu
larly with the tick-tick of Its pendulum, >
an ordinary,, every day Incident happened/
and yet one which the four women pres
ent accepted as a sort of knell of com
ing woe, merely because it was unexpect
ed, and because, in the vague Inquietude
that seemed to be hovering over Ihe
house, any unexpected event appeared
like a menace.
They saw appearâ for the felt slippers
which the servant wore, like all the Gas
cons, made not the slightest sound upon
the stair carpetâ they saw appear the
loosely knotted handkerchief, the fat shin
ing face framed in tresses of jet black
hair, and then the entire ball-like figure
of Maria. She came toward the three wo
men and said in her plaintive voice that
this time was really troubled:
"Mademoiselle"
"What Is the matter, my girl?"
"M. Michel"
As she paused for breath. Mile, de
Sainte-Parade broke in eagerly:
"Ah, Michel has returned. lie wants to
see me?"
"No, mademoiselle. He didn't go away!"
Maria's voice quite failed her.
"What Is the matter with you?" cried
the invalid in sudden rape.- "Will you tell
us what is the matter, idiot?"
"M. Michel won't come upstairs." said
Maria. "He has been waiting In the ves
tibule beside St. Anthony. He wants' to
speak to Mile. Romaine." :citizens ' also managed to protect Â¦them

Enemy's Attacks at Night.
The attacks of the enemy were always
at night, and sometimes during the after
noon or evening preceding their attacks
we would find the people "preparing for
safety by digging trenches and by putting
up little defenses in their yards,^and in
some cases, where the ground floor was
of earth, the trenches were dug inside tho
dwelling. I assumed that these people
r had received notification of the proposed
attack from friends in the Insurgent
camp.
At Santa Rita and Guagua these prepar
ations were sometimes made without be
ing followed by a night attack. On these
occasions I presume they had been in
formed of the proposed attack, which for
some reason or other was not carried out.
About 2 o'clock on the morning of Sep
tember 9 quite a formidable attack was
made., nearly the entire brigade of General
Mascardo was' engaged, a small force de
monstrated against San Antonio and an
other small force against Guagua, while
the main body of infantry and one piece
of artillery attacked Santa Rita.
ade. General MacArthur's division. I
hastened to comply with the order, and
after a few days' stay at San Fernando
was directed to take command of the
troops stationed at Bacolor, San Antonio,
Santa Rita and Guagua, with my head
quarters at Santa Rita.
Nearly all the inhabitants of these cit
ies had remained when the insurgents
left, or had returned after our arrival.
We established civil government, and
e\-erything was maintained in a quiet and
orderly manner. At that time General
MacArthur was stationed at San Fer
nando, on the railroad forty miles north
of Manila, and Agulnaldo, with the inâ
surgent Congress and Cabinet, was at
Tnrlac, on the same road, thirty-five
miles farther north, while the American
and insurgent troops closely confronted
each other between those two points.
The center of the insurgent line was on
the railroad a short distance north of
Ar.geles. The enemy's flanks, which ex
tended some miles to the right and left,
were thrown forward or toward the
south, the effect bÂ«ing to in a measure
encircle, the more advanced position of
our trocps.
On ths Firing Line.
The campaign in which the brigade 1
commanded took part included the en
gagements at Santa Rita. September 9
and 16; the attack and capture of the en
emy's intrenched position at Porac, Sep
tember 28; several warm fights at Angeles,
October 10-20, in some of which the en
c-my's force numbered about 3500 men; the
advance on and capture of Bamban,- No
vember 11, and the occupation of Tarlac,
November 13, which ended all organized
resistance to our arms in that part of Lu
zon north of Manila.
The fights of October 11 and 16 were con
siderable affairs. Tho attack directly in
our front was by General Concepclon with
the brigades of General Hizon and Colonel
Queri, that on the right by General Aklno
and on our left by General Mascardo.
Eanta Rita is quite an old town and is
very similar to the other cities or pueblos
in Northern Luzon. The church and mon
astery face the public square. Their walls
are very massive, some six or eight feet
thick, and tho buildings, takf n all In all,
Imposing. The monastery had been va

by two companies of our. H-jldlers.- They

The Priests Friendly.

to prevent the possiollity of anything con

priests and presidents were In frequent

and the people were on .the best of terms.
I was Informed, and.no- doubt my in
formation was correct, that .some oX the
leading men were In frequent communi
cation with General Mascardo, who com
manded a brigade at Poras, about seven
miles distant. It would have been quite
difficult to have proved this against them,
and I think that their reason for keeping
up this communication was to shield
tnemselves " f rom punishment In case our
troops withdrew. I think that' they were
at heart friendly to tho Americans and
preferred their occupation, but If their

Praise for Our Soldiers.
And here I want to tay one word re
garding the American soldiers in the
Philippines as 1 saw them. The troop.s
under my Immediate command were the
Ninth and Twelfth Regular Infantry.
Both of these regiments were officered by
earnest, devoted and- chivalrous gentle
men, and the soldiers were men selected
from the best type of that class of Amer
icans who earn their living by daily labor,
with quite a sprinkling of men of high
education, some of them being graduates
of our best' co'ietes.
These officers and soldiers had marched
end fought and occupied city after city,
and I do not recall an Instance where their
treatment of the natives was other 4h*n
humane and kind in all respects. In my
order to these troops bidding them fare
well, at a time when their service and good
conduct were fresh in my mind, 1 ex
pressed my appreciation of them in these
words: ' .
"You have always been prompt to the
moment in taking positions in line of bat
tle. Your marches have been rapid and
well conducted, and your treatment of and
bearing toward the Filipino people has
been of a" character which could well be
taken as a model and example .by all sol
diers placed under similar conditions."
This was certainly true these
soldiers^ and I "think that any wrongs,
accounts of which, have appeared in
American newspapers', were perpetrated
during the early days of our occupation
and largely, by hangers-on, employes or
camp followers, who are found with all
armies. -In all my association' with'. reaf
soldiers which, ; while in the military ser
vice,'was close and constant, I learned
that no hearts are more tender than those
found | in i the of . those good "and
brave men who voluntarily give their ser-
vices for the defense and honor of their
country, and this Is true whether they be
privates in the ranks or wear insignia of
officers. Â¦ ,' : -â¢
It was this character, of Americans who
met vast. hordes of men; women and chil
dren that, after the dispersement ' of the
insurgent government, commenced their
slow and painful return to the Homes
which months before they had been forced
by their, own people to abandon. .
Sad â¢ Return of the Fugitives.
We" met, thousands of these poor, suffer
ing people. They seemed. to be traveling
in parties of all sizes 'from five or six up
to seventy or eighty. They were generally
badly' clothed, and the women-respeclally
the elder onesâ appeared. to be weak and
emaciated. Man; members of the same
party carried bamboo poles with, a white
flag: attached, and frequently a. little child
was sent in advance with a white hand
kerchief waving from the " top of a pole,
very much like the reeds used for fishing
poles In America,
The difficulties encountered by these
people In working their way homeward
were very great. A typical picture of this
character Is one I recall as I was traveling
from Paniqui. on the railroad, to the
pueblo of San Ignacio. in the foothills of
the mountains, about seventeen miles to
the west. We had met several small par
ties during the day; It was nearly sun
down. We were passing through a stretch
of country densely wooded with high
trees and undergrowth on each side of the
road so thick that even a person on foot
could with difficulty penetrate it. The fo
liage was so dense aa to always obscura
the sun. Tho road was so wet and boggy
that a horse would sink deeply in tho
mire at every step. It was In the middle
of a stretch of three miles of this kind ot
jungle that we met a party of some sev
enty men. women and children.
Some of the women were struggling,
along supported by two men. and none
seemed to be able to walk more than a
very short distance without stopping to
rest. Their carts were almost at a stand
still, some of them mired down to the
axies. Their progress had been very slow,
and I learned from this party that they
had been all day traveling two miles, and
they were then preparing to stop for the
night In the dismal, cheerless locality I
have described.
Innocent Sufferers of War.
Some of them showed by their faces ant
their garments that they had been accus
tomed to the comforts and very probably
tho luxuries of life.
I could .not but hope that these poor
people were not those whose homes had
been burned by the Insurgent leaders, but
I feared for the worst, as In our advance
north we found that In some localities
this devastation had been very general.
We naturally entertained intense feelings
against the insurgent officers and soldiers
who rose In arms against us at the very
time we were doing all in our power for
their benefit, but no American heart could
have other than the warmest compassion
for these poor, innocent sufferers.
This was the first meeting of most of
these people with American soldiers. As
usual in such cases, some dozen or .more
white handkerchiefs or white garments oi
some kind were being waved in the air.
We did all possible to reassure them and
assisted them so far as was In our power,
for which they seemed very grateful. A3
I was riding by a woman with a child in
her arms, the little thing with a bright,
appealing face, stretched out its hands to
me, and the mother came up beside my
horse, while the child caught me affeo
tionately by the arm.
The children generally appear to be very
bright. Very frequently when we passed
them on the roads little tots, not more
than 4 or 5 years of age, would call out
In a clear, distinct voice, the only English
words they knew, "Good morning, good
morning." and they did not seem to share
In the apprehension of their elders, which
In all cases was very great until after
they had been In actual contact with
American soldiers.
llatives Flee in Terror.
Soon after driving the enemy from Tar
lac I went on an expedition to the edge
of the mountain ranges to the west of
the railroad. The roads were regarded
as Impassable, the obstacles being swift
water courses and almost continuous rice
fields, with water and mud from twelve
to thirty inches in depth.
Beyond these water courses and almost
impassable paths and fields the natives
had established a military post at San
Miguel de Camlllng, and General Maca
bulos. with a thousand armed Insurgents,
was reported to be In command. In my
journey to this place I passed through
several considerable towns or barrios. In
most case3 all the people fled, so that
when we entered the town not a living
soul could be found. As we were not ex
pected on this road nor from the direction
from which we came, our approach was
always a surprise, and the condition of
their houses showed they had no time
for the slightest preparation.
Iu 8omÂ« of the towns a few very old
men or women were left, but they either
knelt or crouched down, ' saying. "We are
only poor old men." or "poor old women."
This alarm of the inhabitants was espe
cially manifested when I approached the
town of San Miguel de Camillng. It Is a
well laid out city of about 6000 Inhabit
ants, with neighboring barrios contain
ing about the same number of people.
Before reaching the town and at a point
about a mile distant from It, we were
compelled to swim our horses across a
deep lagoon, which detained the great
body of our men:
I rode to tho edge of the city myself
and there % saw the great mass of men,
women and children crowding through,
the streets in their efforts to escape.
Reassuring the People.
In front of one of the first houses an old
man was kneeling and muttering some
words to me while he held up a handker
chief tie'd in the shape of a bag and filled
with money. No doubt he had been told
that we would rob and kill him. and ha
hoped by giving up his money to save his
life. We did all in our power to reassure
him and others who were In the same
frightened condition, and we succeeded In
catching up to a few of the flying people
and tried to reassure them also.
Some Spanish prisoners escaped and
came In to us, and finally by means of a
Chinaman we sent word out and persuad
ed the priests and a few others to return.
The more I saw of these people the more
thoroughly I was convinced that when wo
have an opportunity to meet them with
kind words and give them tho protection
of our Government their devotion to ua
and to American rule will be earnest and
sincere.
They are naturally a decile and peace*
loving peopIeT and their desire seems to be
to pursue quietly their accustomed avoca
tions and to enjoy the happiness of domes
tic life. It is true the Ladrones and a few
others are turbulent and lawless, but they
are so few aa to be only exceptions In a
vast population of 11.000.000.

THE rarly history cf the Philippine
Islands is to a sreat dfgree involved
in- mystery, but through the re
searches of several Spanish histor
ians during the nineteenth century
tome little light has beon thrown
upon it.
It appears" to be-cenora!ly admitted that
the original inhabitants were a very dark
and inferior race called "Negritos"; but
many centuries ago people of other na
tiens. attracted by the r:ch soil and coxn
raiatively healthful climate of the Philip
pines, made their homes in various parts
of these Islands. The Arabs in consider
able numbers settled in the Inlands nearly
a. thousand years ago. Chinese and Jap
anese and Hindoos- a! so made permanent
settlements. Intermarriages took place
end resulted In the production of a mixed
race found in possession by the Spaniards
when Manuel dc- Legaspi in 1DG4, forty odd
years after Magellan's voyage, took pos
session of the islands.
The Original Filipino.
It could not be said even then that they
were a barbarous and totally uncultured
people. They had ships and carried on
commerce with Chira, Japan and India.
They had factories where they worked in
metals â iron, brass, silver and gold. They
manufactured powder, made brick, ex-
Oelled in wood carving, and some cf their
products of iron were spoken of as supe
rior ar.d Â«ven as superb. The first Span
ish colonists spoke very favorably of the
Etate cf civilization in the island.-;, report

people and appeared to be governing with

It was In August that I reached Manila.
A typhoon had be-en raping some days,
ar.d the bay was very rough, which is al
ways the case In storms, as Manila Bay
Is more of an inland sea than a harbor.

ashore with the officers of the port who
came out to meet us. Immediately upon
landing I hastened to the headquarters

residence I reported to General Schwan.
the chief of staff. The next morning 1
returned, found General Otis and ex
pressed to him my desire for service in
the field and my readiness for immediate
Â«2uty.
It was the rainy Reason, and the fall of
vater was excessive and almost con
stant. This did not make it disagreeable
to these who could be und*r cover, but the
rentinels on post and those soldiers who
wÂ«-re exposed had my hearty sympathy.
No amount of protection from rubber
Â«-oats fccmed to be of service. The sentl
r.els were constantly and thoroughly sat
urated with water. Those in Manila had
pood quarters, and after finishing their
tour of duty they were well housed and
Â¦were able to make themselves comfort
able with dry clothing.
The City of Manila.
Mar.lla Is about twenty-five miles from
the entrance of the bay. The original
city. located on the left side of the Pasig
Hirer, was laid cut 300 years ago and is
really an inclosed fortification. It is built
â¢up closely, with narrow streets and en
circled by massive walls, with six large,
pates, ramparts, sentinel towers and a
deep, broad ditch into which water from
the river or bay can be thrown by means
of Flu ices constructed for that purpos*.
A century and a ha!f ago this fortification
trou'.d have been regarded as formidable.
It is very much on the plan of a vauban
front and there it has stood for some
three centuries. The scars made in the
walls by the English In 1752 are still vis
ible. It is urged by some that this forti
fication should be removed, but I think
this would be unfortunate, and would
rather see ft preserved as the finest monu
ment of antiquity in our possession. It
S*. indeed, a unique specimen of medieval
trchlttcture.
The Walled City.
The "Walled City" is about 4000 feet lonjr
and 2%<0 feet broad. The population with
in the walls, which Is very dense, is, how
ever, enly a small portion of the real
population of the whole city, as after a
frrad-jal growth of three centuries Manila
ar.d Its various outlying districts is now
& closely built up city, with a population
which has been variously estimated, one
fcfflclal statement putting It' as high as
D00.OO0. This Is unquestionably much too
large, and I think 300,000 would be. the
outside limit. A partial census recently
taken Indicates even a much lower figure.
The localities outside the walls are deslg
rated by distinct names, ninondo, San
Jose, Santa Crus. Qulapo, San Miguel,
Eampaloc. Tondo and Malate.
Attractive Malate.
These parts are more modern, and the
architecture Is generally of the character
adopted by Spaniards. The most attract
ive cf these Is Malate. the southern sub
urb, that portion extending along â¢ the
water being a very desirable location for
residences. The houses face upon a broad
street, and those on the water Bldo have
grounds extending to the bay. with bath
houses and pavilions, constantly washed

A Pathetic Incident.
. Just after the insurgent attack on Sep
tember 9 I hunted up a wounded Filipino
woman and finally found her on the back
porch of the dwelling of a native doctor.
He stated that he had examined her arm
and found that the bone was not frac
iured. He had wrapped ' the arm In a
:loth torn from an old soiled garment,
prhlch horrified our surgeons, who regard
jleanllness and the use of antiseptic
bandages as absolutely essential in the,
treatment of wounds. When urged to al
fow us to take her to the hospital she
pointed In a most pitiful way to her baby,
r.nd in answer to our appeals she said:
''My baby, my baby." . â¢ /
Bhe also spoke of her husband, and after
tome delay he was found, and the critical
condition of his wife explained to him.
Dr. Pinkham reported to the native doc
tor that his examination showed the
wound .to be a serious fracture and Â¦ in
5uced him to join us in urging upon both
husband and wife the necessity of skill
ful treatment. The woman yielded to our
kind reassurances and was carried on a
litter to the hospital and the operation
was immediately commenced by Dr. Pink
bam, assisted by some other surgeons
Â»nd several attendants. I watched the
process and saw seven pieces of bone
taken from her arm.
been questioned they would have been in
great danger, had the insurgents regained
control. '.-â¢Â¦â¢: 'f . Â¦
â¢ Filipinos Desire Peace.
My investigation led me to conclude that
tae prevailing sentiment, the great desire
of tho people, was for the restoration or
peace, so that they could quietly pursue
their avocations; and I am quite con
vinced that when they learn. that such
will be the case under American rule they
will be perfectly satisfied with our con
trol of the Islands. The priest" arid some
of the members of his family were very
agreeable and Intelligent gentlemen.
I went with members of my staff to his
church and showed all respect possible
to their order of service. The music was
very sweet, and this I found to be the'
case in all the other churches visited by
me. At the time when I was present only
the women partook of communion. They
seemed very devout, and nothing in my
whole tour in Luzon Impressed "me more
favorably than the devotion of the
women. They are devoted to their
churches, their religion, 'their children,
their parents and all their relatives.
They are Industrious In the extreme, and
I never saw anything that could be said
to approximate frivolity.-
Women Noticeably Modest.
The womenâ that Is, the. ladles of the
higher class In the cities, especially In
L-anila â are very strict in their etiquette,
and among the laboring population there
was a general air of modesty which was
quite noticeable. It is true they have cus
toms which seem inconsistent with this,
and their style of dress miRht be cited as
not SL'stainir.s this view. The women of
the higher c!ass wear long dresses, but
i..e laboring women, wear short dresses,
and cne shoulder is almost always ex
posed, but this being universal excites no
criticism. My' association with the neo
plp was largely In the cities and country
oi the broad, rich valley extending 123
miles north of Manila. With regard to
the women in this locality, I can saw with
confidence that the general impression
made upon our. soldiers and officers was
very favorable.

It easy for them to be driven In advance of

â¢ Notwithstanding that General Luna was
commander in chief, some of the insur
gent offlcials advised against this policy,
and insisted that the houses should be un
disturbed and the citizens permitted to
remain. Where this was done, and the
Filipino families remained In the cities oc
cupied by our troops, they seemed to be
very grateful for 'the protection they re
ceived; but It is difficult to describe or
even to Imagine the suffering and distress
of those families who fled upon the ap
proach of the Americans. As our troops
advanced northward these unfortunate
natives were compelled to continue their
retreat, each movement separating them
farther and farther from the beloved spot
where they had enjoyed the comforts and
pleasures of* home. This hardship was
very great, because the love of family,
home and Its surrounding? is one of the
strongest features in Filipino character.
Sometimes the more fortunate? o' these
exiles succeeded in securing shelter In
houses. Some possessed carabao carts.
The Massive Churches.
The most striking feature In Manila is
Its churches. They are large buildings,
with massfve walls and high towers, the
architecture being grand and imposing,
A convent or monastery, generally a very
Jarre building, is connected with every
church. The floors are all stone, and the
rooms are occupied by members of relig
ious orders. Most of the priests whom I
met are very intelligent and are polite
and courteous In the extreme. They took
me through all the rooms, showed me
the libraries and explained their method
of living, their lines of study and the
work they had accomplished.
One of the largest and finest churches
In Manila, was destroyed by an earth-
Quake, and the ruins still remain, no at
tempt having been made to rebuild It.

Business in Manila seems to be carried
on very much as it is in New- York City.
The importing and exporting houses have,
their counting-rooms, offices and store
bouses, as we see like business carried on
in Front and Water streets in New York.
We then see blocks of stores which re
mind us of the grocery and like business
houses on West street; and in Manila, on
the Escolta and Rosario. are numerous
dry goods, notions and other retail houses
like the stores of Sixth and Seventh ave
nues. Of course, there are no magnificent
establishments like these on Broadway
and Fourteenth street, but there is a
growing tendency in Manila to beautlfy
the store fronts and arrange the windows
in a tasteful, manner.

people seemed to have some intimation of
a ; proposed assault on the place. Many
took adequate measures to shelter them
selves, but the great mass of the people
had no other protection than that afford

cious, as the fire of the insurgents was
always very high and few of their mis
siles took effect. The sleeping apartments

â¢feet above the ground, and had they re
mained In them the casualties would have
been very great, as many of the houses
were literally riddled with the Insurgents'
bullets.

The French butcher or baker expects to rest amid

the most profusely. An oN/lisk of imposing propor

which are dimly traced on the granite railing.

was almost covered with little bunches of fresh vio
lets. As they were in disorder, some of them having
fallen to the ground. I inferred that they had been
thrown fiver the iron fence which prevents one from
approaching the tomb. There was an Incongruity
that was fascinating in medieval gargoylen grinning
on fresh violets, but who. 1 wondered, was responsi

and Heloise to'dYcoiate their graves?

with a bunch of violets. She. hatleFs and glovelcss,

Sunday shine had not removed. I guessed was a ven

ling acuteness was required to discover that fact,
although they did not utter a word. With only one
thing to'say. this was probably ecstatic intermission.
They threw their violets ever the iron prill and the
mystery was solved. Abelard and Heloise were kepi
resplendent by such simple lovers as these. All of
the little bunches of violets were undoubtedly the
tributes of Jove to love. AbelarA. the scholar, the
theologian, the philosopher, is forgotten, but Abelard
the lover is immortal!

Well, the young officer died suddenly

that night the trouble began. Strange rap

began the day following his burial and
years .afterward every officer who was
quartered -In.. No. 2 on the port side of the
Monongahela's wardroom sought an early
opportunjty of relinquishing * the berth,
though few were willing to admit any
ghostly experiences. , But among the sail
ors of the ship talk about the paymaster's
ghost began within a few weeks of his
departure! The earliest yarns were spun
for' the men on' duty in the storerooms
and paymaster's office.'- Nearly every
night they, reported that' he 'was seen pot
tering around among the ship's stores
and figuring up accounts on the deck by
the safe. One of the men. the pay yeo
man, was sent to the sick bay. His illness
was trifling, but he told the doctor one
morning that his time had surely come,
for the dead paymaster had stood by his
bedside at two bells in the middle watch
and beckoned him away. And, as a mat
ter Of fact, he dted in a day or two.
About three months after this Passed
Assistant Paymaster S joined the
ship. He was a lively young chap. He
had no superstition whatever, he said,
and cheerfully installed himself fn room
No. -2 on the port side. The evening of
April 23, 1SS3, was one of unusual merri
ment in the mess. The ship was home
ward bound with a 'fair wind and the
passed assistant paymaster was the jol-
Hest man on board. About two hours
after everybody had turned liithe entire
wardroom was awakened by an unearthly
yell, followed by a noise of a man falling.
The officers turned out, lights ' were
struck, and there was S doubled over
an upset chair and moaning unintelli

pause; "I- was very cold., and at .first I
thought I had a chill. I raised myself up
on my elbows to get a "better view of j

with- 'something clammy and slimy and-

seaweed. The thing is there nowâ lying

tale that when they examined Mr. Sâ â 's

an established legend in the navy, room

unoccupied until the reconstruction.
Few officers are aliveto-day who served -
with the Monongahela on that memorable
cruise; but the following story concern
ing strange happenings on the Ticonde
roga has been told by an officer of high'
rank now in the department of naval in
telligence arid another at present connect
ed with the Bureau of Ordnance. The
Ticonderoga was of -trie Monongahela
class, a wooden steamer of 2000 tons dis

AMONG WOMEN WHO MUST HAVE A PET IN THE HOUSE
About forty minutes later the first lieu
tenant was awakened by the sound of a
heavy body moving stealthily around the
wardroom to the accompaniment of a
muttering voice. The lieutenant arose
and stepped out Into the light that came
dimly from a single lamp over the center
table. On the table itself he beheld the
figure cf Mr. X, dressed only in pajamas
and moving in a circle on hands and
knees over the polished mahogany. Mean
while he repeated over and over In sepul
chral accents a mystic phrase: "Little
pieces of orange peel; little pieces of or
ange peel." Being aroused, Mr. X ex
plaineu that he had dreamed he was on
the verge of an important scientific dis
covery. The disclosure that Mr. X was a
f Jeep- walker was thought to solve the
mystery; but though he was carefully
watched thereafter the noises continued
and on the Frolic's arrival in New York

Down to 2230, when "the wardroom
country" of the old corvette Monongahe'.a
was overhauled and reconstructed, the
t-econd room of the port side of thÂ« ves
sel had been left vacant .for three cruises.
It was the Monongahela that was washed
ashore in Peru in the *jO'b by a tidal wave
end then washed to sea again without
suffering any serious injury, and with tr e
loss of only a single man. But this ha?
nothing to do with the ghost story, ar.d
Is mentioned only to Identify the vessel.
Years after the tidal wave Incident thrre
was a one-eyed paymaster with a rod
l>c-ard on the Monongahela. He . was
known throughout the navy, as one of the
three cr four best story tellers In the en
tire service He was also famous for his
love of whisky. The former made him a
reneral favorite, and the latter ultima tcK'
brought him to his end. When told that
he was soing to die he summoned his fel
low-officers to his bedside.
"Dear boys." he said, "you have llke-1
me and I love you for it. I've often
heard you eay the wardroom mess
wouldn't be a mess at all without me.
ar.d so I'll tell you what I'm going to do:
I'll be around as usual In my old room.

More than one veteran seaman wiped
his eyes two or three days later when the
The Frolic, an old-fashioned craft ,of
about TOO tons, then was used for years as
a dispatch boat and tender, was loner al
leged to be haunted, because of certain
extraordinary noises heard In the ward
room about the beginning of the mid
watch every night. So persistent and
grewsome were these sounds that none of
the wardroom boys could be persuaded to
* enter the apartment unless accompanied
by a commissioned officer, after 10 o'clock,
when lights were put out. Even the offi
cers were annoyed, since the noises not
only interrupted the slumber of men liable
,to be called for duty at any hour of the
r.i?ht. but also increased the natural su
perstition of the 6allor. Mr. X, the Junior
watch cfScer, professed to have been kept
awake several hours one night, and on his
motion a party was formed the following
evening- with the intention of surprising
the ghostly visitant. The cScers sat up
to an unusual hour, maintaining perfect
ellence, but nothing happened by 1 o'clock
and they turned in.

AGED INDIAN DIES.
El Compadre, Aged One Hundred and
Fifteen Years, Passes Away.
Special Dispatch to The Call. Â¦
SAN DIEGO, May 5.â Word was re
ceived tills evening of the death to-day at
the Indian rancherla, about four miles
below the line in Lower California, of El
Compadre, the oldest resident of the
peninsula. His age was recorded at 115
at the registration of his death, and old
residents who had known him for many
years have little doubt of the correctness
of the count. For more than thirty years
he had been known Â¦ as an aged and dried
up Indian, and his great-grandchildren
have been ministering to his few wants at
the rancherla. .
He was once -well known in San Diego,
but for. the pa.st eleven years he had not
been able to travel so tai; away from the
shack which 'provided hlnS with shelter.
While he has never been able to tell his
age to a certainty, he has. told of being a
strong, full-grown man a long time before
the fort at Yuma was built. Years ago
his age was figured out by what he told
as being close to 100 years. He. has sur
vived all his children and many "of his
grandchildren have passed away,, but
there are few Indians in the northern part
of the peninsula who have not. traced re
lationship to him. The funeral will be
held' according to Indian rites on Monday.

one of the principal speakers at the
Women's Parliament In Chicago, and in
keeping with her intense patriotism she
spoke upon the methods in vogue in Rus
sia that entailed imprisonment in Sibe
rian prisons, and addressed herself to the
theme that removed rreedom from the
subjects of the Czar. The address re
ceived much attention In foreign and
American diplomatic circles and was
widely copied. These utterances caused
the madame to fall under the ban of th*
Czar.
During her Eastern tour she determined
to visit Poland, and permission was
sought from St. Petersburg, but a refusal
was the answer. The Russian Embassa
dor at Washington was asked to aid, and
other agencies were invoked. The only

It is now very plain that the
forward movement from Bloem
fontein has begun in earnest. By
his move on Brandfort, now the
headquarters of the British army,
Lord Roberts has made a great
stride toward Kroonstad, in the
neighborhood of which it has
been reported that the Boers
have been building extensive for
tifications. There is general re
joicing here over the good prog

time the fact must be taken into
consideration that before Kroon

need to be driveiVout of the Win

advance and secure further time

British forces farther north.
While it is the opinion of some
old military men here that Lord
Roberts' army, moving on a very
broad front, ought not "to have
any difficulty in enveloping the

HOW THE BRITISH
TOOK BRANDFORT
Details of the Battles Preceding
the F^etiremeQt of the
Boers.
BRANDFQRT, Orange Free State. May 4.â The capture of the town was tha
result of an. admirably .conceived and well executed combined movement.
The night before the British" advance 4000 Boers moved here, taking up a
strong line of defense with the avowed object of opposing the British to
the bitter end.
As a result of the strategy of Lord Roberts they were forced to retreat
hastily, nearly losing a convoy of guns and abandoning the defense of the town.
Lord Roberts was present while the operations were in progress on a kopje north
of Kafee, in which position he was In helio'graphic communication with each
column. -
On the right Brunee and Hamilton's brigade moved eastward along a line of
a kopje communicating by a road with a railroad. In close touch followed Max
well's brigade with Wavell on his left, all under command of Lieutenant General
Tucker. General Pole-Carew's division formed the center advance, composed of
Jones' and Stevenson's brigades, while Hutton's mounted infantry, made up
mainly of Canadians, Australians and New Zealanders, made a wide detour and
arrived at the east of the town.
The niijht before the occupation of Brandfort the Brftish seized two small
kopjes commanding a deep and ugly spruit, which it was known thcifoers daily
occupied. General Pole-Carew ordered two battalions of Guards to move silently
after nightfall and occupy the kopjes, which was done without opposition. This
greatly facilitated the advance, as the Boers relinquished the spruit, allowing
the passage of the whole force unopposed.
About three hours after the advance commenced heavy artillery firing wa3
heard to the right. Maxwell, finding that the Boers had two suns posted in a
good position, engaged them with his artillery at a 1500-yard range. Both sides
fired furiously, but the Boers' guns were soon completely silenced.
The gun fire whs heard to the left, where Genera^ Ilutton had come In touch
with the Boers, who were holding a strong position. Owing, however, to the un
expected arrival of the British the Boers left , several small kopjes unoccijpied.
and, seizing these. General Hutton opened fire with his battery, sending COlonel'
Anderson to outflank the', Boers on the left. The Boers, unable to withstand the
shrapnel, evacuated their kopjes and streamed across the plain to a small kopja
immediately above, commanding the town.. . '-.:â¢ v â¢,.',3'
t As they retreated the battery placed several shells with great acuracy in their
midst, and they immediately retreated from their second position, a move that
was perceived by Hutton. who sent a portion of his troops in pursuit. Remington
seized the kopje abandoned by the Boers. Thereupon the Boers retired. 'leaving
the town at the mercy of the British- In the meantime Colonel Anderson, trying 1
to outflank, found the Boers. His galloping Maxim received a heavy pompom fire
and he was obliged to retire. On the other side Maxwell forced the Boers' position.
By 2 o'clock the whole force was several miles off, trekking ntrth. Several
prisoners were taken, including a commandant, who had returned in order to de
stroy the telegraph instruments.
The townspeople declare that the Irishr-American contingent with the Boers
behaved riotously when the fighting began and refused to take part in It, only
manning a korje close to the town: (
The military attaches with the Boers watched the fight through glasses from
kopjes north of the town, following the movements on maps. It appears that while
watching the British in front they failed to perceive Hutton's movement, and his
arrival caused them to retreat.
All the British movements were carried out like clockwork. The casualties
w-;re very few. Their advance presented a superb spectacle as the long front
pushed slowly forward. After the retreat of the Boers the whole mounted infan
try was sent in pursuit, entering the town at 2 p. m., close behind the retreating
Boers, but the latter were too quick to be overtaken: .
While General Pole-Carew's division was occupying: the town General Tucker
engaged with a force of some 4000 Boers on -the British right." ' southwest of the
town. During the artillery duel Wavell's brigade came under the concentrated fire
of the Boers' guns and was forced to retire.
The Boers finally retired with two guns disabled, making good their . retreat.
The prisoners say that there were about 6000 Boers In the town, including 1000 who
hadT been'onposed to the British at Thaba Nchu.

America and the Boers.
The absence of any development in the
I American controversy with Turkey has
resulted in that matter being banished
from the serious probabilities, and no idea
is entertained in England that it will re
suit seriously.
Regarding the Boer delegates, the Spec
tator and the Outlook voice current Kng
lish opinion, the former saying that there
is jio fear that the Americans will be
taken in. the more especially as it la very
doubtful whether the delegates have any
power -to bind either President Kruger
or the Volksraad, while the Outlook re
marks:
"The only hopes of the delegates in tlje
United States lie in the gamble of Presi
dential politics. Yet even there the pros
pect iÂ« disheartening. The Americans
will rememberâ if the delegates don't â
that America ewes her independence, to
armed protests against being taxed with
out representation. "
Secretary Root's Monroeism utterances
are dealt with in a long article In the
Spectator, which maintains that "the War
Secretary's explanation that he was
speaking academically must be taken into
account, and that he deserves praise for
Epeakir.? as frankly as he did."
Tho article continues: "The American
who takes the trouble to look the facts
in the face cannot fail to see that the doc
trine cannot be supported on tall talk.
America must not imagine that if she ever
gets into a serious controversy with a
great Continental power she will be treat
ed as Lord Salisbury, with the full con
sent of the nation, treated her. Hers we
should dread a victory over America,
supposing we were able to obtain It. only
one degree less than defeat. But it is idle
to suppose that the Continental powers-
Germany, for instanceâ would take such
thing"? into consideration. Granted she
wanted to Infringe upon the Monroe doc
trine, Germany would simply consider
whether America had physical power to
maintain it. If she had not. America's
historical claims would not be held to be
worth a straw."
Possible German Interference.
The Spectator thon goes on to say that
r.o power would dream of invading Amer
ica but Germany. The paper adds:
"For Instance, the latter country might
get into a dispute with Brazil and pre
pare to occupy its territory- If America
should wish to enforce the Monroe doc
trine she muÂ«t be able to destroy the
German fleet. Her present officers and
men are as good as possible. They have
superior? nowhere and equals only in the
sister navy of Great Britain. But there
are too few of them."
Regarding the strength of her forces,
the paper says: "Clearly, if while Ger

little or nothing. America will not be In a
position to fetter Germany's will or to

terms she likrs with the South Americkn
powers."
The Spectator disclaims In those ajarm
ipt views any wish to tempt America to
take a warlike course or to makÂ»Â» any 111
blood between America and Germany, hut
maintains that Secretary Root Is right,
and "if he sticks to the MonroÂ« doctrine
and yet refuses to prepare there is in

LONDON. May C.-ThÂ»Â» report that chnl
era is strengthening Its deadly hold on
famine-stricken India brings the pitiful
condition of that country more than ever
to public view. About !Â«3,500.0u<) personsâ
for this is the population of th<" districts
affwtcdâ arÂ« sweltering their squalid ex
istence away amid pesiiler.ee and misery
That show no signs of abatement. Hun
dreds of thousands cf pounds in good
f.ritish gold, good German marks and
American corn hav<Â» been thrown Into the
country, but. judging frora the latert ad
vice;:, all this charity is merely a drop in
â¢he ocean.
The famine ar.d its attendant complica
tions appear to txceed liie virulence of
any previous visitation?. The Viceroy,
],ord Curson of Keddleston. and the Gov
ernment are making ceaseless exertions
to meet the terrible emergency, but the
stupendous Â«li!fict:liies confronting: them
prevent the prosent supplying of relief to
more than Jive millioi!*. In the meantime
th<Â» native Matotf are Hotted with heaps ot
dead and dyine and the roads are crowd
ed with ghastly tands peeking to escape
from the stricken territory, but most ot
v.hom, for lack of J>Â»od and water, fuc
< limb In th<Â» nttempt. One <if the most
Impdcfs 1>aturr-*j i.f the whole affair is
contained i:i the statement of a present
corrpFponflont at 8!m!n. wh.Â» writes:
"Ten time* the total relief could be laid
out in a. e'tiÂ£le district without fully re-
I levins the distress. A!! wo can hope for
j> a sucoession r>f gornl years to put the
people on their Irj^s again."
Th*Â» British districts are reported to bÂ«
fo far efcaiiins the iaiRp starvation and
mortality that mark tne native states.
But that thoir condition is not enviable Is
Â«vider.t from thp following description
Â¦sent by a ifombdy correspondent ot the
at Almedabad, a city In the Presi
Â«>ncy of Bombay:
"In an open tpac upward of 200 wore
seated, old and younp. being famine per
fior.ified. The smell arising from their
rags was sickening and had attracted
myriads of flies. Some, especially the old
rnen, were borsy framework. A girl suck
,ling two children v.as phastly to look at.
but the little ones, with sunken eyes and
â¢ hecks and the napes of their necks fall
ing in under their skulls, which seemed to
overbalance their emaciated bodies, and
with wispllke legs, were more dreadful
BtUL Many were suffering from disease
and numbers had the fever. Those who
rould work were sent on where tanks
were being dug. Others werÂ« given a
rcf-aJ and passed on to the poorhouse."
This picture is frcm a less seriously af- '
fectc-d part of the country. The sufferings
In the remoter districts, where the famine
is worse, where the cattle have long since
riied, where the watt-r is precious and
where cholera has made its dread scourge
felt, can be well imagined.

PARIS, May 5.â Foreign visitors to
Paris this week find the dead walls cov
ered with huge colored posters setting
forth the electoral manifestos of the can
didates for the municipal elections which
are to J>e held to-morrow (Sunday)
throughout France. The results are
awaited with particular Interest owing to
the announced intention of the National
ists to utilize the election as a field of
battle to test the feeling of the country
on the Government's policy, especially in
domestic matters. This introduction of
general politics into municipal elections
by tho Nationalists is a breach of the
truce tacitly entered into between the
various parties during the period' of th8
exposition. The Vecent accidents, at the
exposition have served them as a weapqn
of attack upon the Ministry, and this ex
plains their Incessant attempts to cast
responsibility upon M. Millerand.
Tnis campaign is intended largely for
the electorate of Paris, on which the
Nationalists will make their most deter
mined assault. They have eighty candi
dates and their success or failure consti
tutes a barometer showing the state of
the political atmosphere. At the present
moment, however, there is no sign of seri
ous political effervescence or grave dis
content with the Government. This is
shown by the tranquil manner in which
labor day passed in Franco. At one timo
the celebrations onÂ«the first day of May
almost convulsed the country. Thl3 year
the day fell into complete abeyance, work
proceeding as usual nearly everywhere
and meetings of labor committees, which
formerly were a feature of the day, were
few and far between.
Peculiar Abduction Case.
The Champs Elysee.is the last place
in the world one would think would be
chosen for an attempt at child-abduction
in broad daylight. This, however, hap
pened this week, to the amazement of. all
Paris. The fashionable avenue was
thronged "as is usual in the afternoon
with a stream of equipages and of prom
enaders, when, almost in front of the im
posing entrance of the Exposition, a man
rushed into the roadv.-ay and seized by
the head a horse drawing a fiacre in
which were sealed an elderly lady and
a gentleman In whose arms was a little
boy about four years old.
The same moment a woman sprang to
the carriage, clutched the child and at
tempted to drag him from the vehicle.
The child cried and a crowd surrounded
the group. The newcomer explained that
it was her child whom the old people re
fused to give up. The crowd immediately
took sides with the mother, and the old
lady, bursting into tears, relinquished her
hold.. â¢ -. ..
It was then found that the child was
girdled with an iron chain, which' was.
padlocked to the two occupants of the
iiacre. This discovery excited the. wrath
: of tho spectators, who prepared to handle
the old people roughly. At this junc
ture the police arrived and took the
party to tho station house, where it was
explained that the mother had been. grant
ed a divorce and awarded the custody. of.
the child, but that during an illness she
had him temporarily given into the care
of her mother-in-law, the Baroness von
Veldpge. The latter, upon the mother's
recovery, refused to give up the child,
and tho mother tracked them until she
met them on the Champs Elysee. Tho
Baroness, learning that the. mothor in
tended to recover the child, forcibly if
necessary, had the iron chain forged and
never left her house except in a carriage
and accompanied by the old Prussian of
ficer, who held one end of the chain, the
Baroness holding the other.
At the station-house the mother-in-law
refused to unfasten the padlock and tho
Commissary of Police was obliged to have
the chain flled in two. The child was
then restored to its mother, despite th*
protests and sobs of the Baroness. The
scene of excitement provoked by the dra
matic incident on the Champs Elysees
may well be imagined.
Smoke Shells for Trench Cannon.
An innovation has been introduced In
the French artillery service by the de
cision to furnish the guns with a smoke
shell. Hitherto the cannon had been pro
vided with melinite and shrapnel sheila
only. This new shell is intended to be
launched at an opponent's artillery which,
on bursting, it will envelop In a dense
cloud of smoke, thus hampering the re
turn fire. The- new shell Is the outcome
of the introduction of smokeless powder.
The result now aimed at was nrought
about by the guns themselves, tho firing
of which produced a smoke which blinded
their own gunners. Experiments â¢ show
that this invention creates a sort: of veil
before the enemy's artillery- Both the
army and navy will be supplied with these
shPlls. "I
The date of the opening of the American
national pavilion in the exposition is now
definitely fixed for next' Saturday. The
internal arrangement of. the pavilion dif
fers from that of other national pavilions,
which are generally devoted to a display
of additional exhibits or to some artistic
Exhibits characteristic of their respective
countries...*
ThÂ« American building will bÂ© irlvew'up
to administrative and reception purposes,
the idea being to have a sort of , club
where Americans may fraternize and se
cure Information. On the main floor Is
located a United States postoffice and bu
reau of information, as well as reading
and -writing rooms. The postomc<* is in
tended to be an object lesson to Europeans
of prompt and buslnrssllke handling of
postal matters, and will itself form an
exhibit of as great practical value as any
with which the other national pavilions
are crammed. Tho second floor will be
devoted to the various State headquarters,
the rooms of which -will be handsomely
furnished by the States of New York.
Massachusetts and California, but will be
open to all American 'citizens.
The Commissioners' reception room will
occupy the third floor, while on tho
fourth will be found the headquarters of
the Juries and international congressional
delegates of tho American" Chamber of
Commerce of Paris, of the women's or
ganization and of the Ix>yal Legion.
The selection of members of the Juries
has been a matter occupying. Commis
sioner Peck's serious consideration 're
cently. Every mall has brought him a
bunch of petitions and letters-from wo
men's organizations In America .for. ade
quate representation of women ? on theso
boards.- Mr. Peck announces/: that â¢â¢^^ full
justice will be done these claims and that'
a strong, proportion of the members- of
the juries and of the delegates. tt> the con
gresses will be selected from 'among wo
men. America in this respect .will be far.
ahead of European nations.' France alone
will admit the female element in her rep
resentation, i but the number of French
women jurors will be proportionately only
one-fifth of that of American women.' .

'BERLIN.- May 6.â This was another
Ideal spring day, a regular Kalsiyrwetter,
just tho thing for the interesting army
maneuvers held this morning.. Emperor
William and Emperor Francis Joseph of
Austria left the Anhalt depot at 8 a. m.,
arriving on the Immense plain of Jueter
bogk, where the sham fights were ar
ranged, by 9 o'clock. The exercises occu
pied an hour and a half, after which the
Emperors lunched at Jueterbogk, return-
Ing to Berlin at 1 a. m. Both Emperors
appeared to be. in good health and fine
spirits. The most interesting' features of
sharpshootfng were witnessed, and expla
nations were given to the Austrian Em
peror by Emperor William and General
von Gossler, the Minister of War, and
Count von Schlieffen. the chief of the gen
eral staff, about the Improvements, hith
erto held strictly secret, of both the Ger
man army rifle of the latest pattern and
the new Held guns. These explanations
I were made to Kmpcror Francis Joseph
alone, and not to his military suite. The
Austrian Emperor was deeply interested
in them.; The exercises, however, in them
selves mado a picturesque spectacle, more
especially th* part which displayed the
new tactics of the field artillery.
Emperors Review. Troops.
The Emperors after their arrival at the
Jueterbogk depot mounted horses and
rode past the troops placed In file from tho
depot to the maneuvers Held. When they
arrived there the ordre de bataille was
given out. The. whole was under the com
mand and direction of Major General von
Schmidt, representing the inspector of
field artillery. The troops present were a
battalion of the First Guard Regiment, a
battalion of the Second Guard Keginicnt,
a battalion composed of one company each
of the Guard Chasseurs and Guard
Schueizen Lehr and a battalion of In
fantry of the sharpshooters' school, also
two squadrons of Life Hussars and a Held
artillery regiment made up from the
sixth instruction batteries of field artillery
of the instruction school. Each body was
In. full war strength, with cartridges also,
as in time of war. The full strength of a
Guard Pioneer company also participated.
The most remarkable feature, about which
Emperor Francis Joseph repeatedly ex
pressed his admiration, was the exactness
of aim shown by the artillery and Infan
try, even at great distances'. The Austrian
Emperor once summoned a general of his
suite and pointed out, this feature to .him.
At the conclusion, of the sham 'battle- a
parade marched papt ; the. Emperors. Fran
cis Joseph thanked the -officers command
ing for the Impressive spectacle witnessed
and accorded them high praise. Luncheon
was served at the officers' casino of the
Â¦field artillery,, instruction school. Â«'Â»,.â¢
Emperor William's appointment as Aus
trian field -marshal general pleases him
greatly, the more so because it is a grade
seldom awarded, and none existed in the
Austrian army since the death of Arch
"duke Albrecht in 1S95. The; military rank
! thus conferred on Emperor" William is
higher than his'own in the German army.
Besides this courtesy the Austrian Em
peror also gave William a magnificent
profile of himself, encased in a diamond
studded frame and autographed with the
motto "Semper Idem" (Always tho same).
Emperor Francis Joseph also presented
the German Empress and her whole fam
ily with fine gifts. The visiting Emperor
conferred the grand cross of the Stephen
Order on Count von Bulow, the German
Minister of Foreign Affairs. Before Em
peror Francis Joseph leaves, a rain of or
ders will descend upon Berlin, for the
value in money alone of the decorations
which the Austrian Emperor took along
is said to be 372,000 florins.
Visits a Regiment.
After his return to Berlin Emperor
Francis Joseph paid a number of visits.
Later, between 4 and 5 o'clock.- he drove
to tho barracks of the Emperor Francis
Regiment, which is under his personal
patronage and which is considered one
of the crack regiments of Germany. The
barracks were splendidly ornamented and
decorated. Tho main gate showed a tri
umphal arch, in the enter of which .was
a large Austrian imperial crown, 'and
beneath it on velvet 'the monogram of the
regiment. Beside it were masts bearing
the. Austrian and Hungarian flags, en
twined with evergreen. ThÂ« building
itself showed - appropriate floral decora
tion, and German and Austrian eagles
were everywhere displayed as symbols.
The regiment received Emperor Francis
Joseph, who was accompanied by Em
peror William, in parade form, drawn up
under the command of Lieutenant von
Ravah. At 6 o'clock a banquet was
served at the regimental casino for 125
persons. InMhe earlier hours of the af
ternoon Emperor Francl3 Joseph received
delegations from the Austrian clubs of
Berlin, with which he conversed in the
most" affable manner, in some cases in
quiring about some personal affairs. The
Austrians residing in Berlin, altogther
some 20,000 persons, gave a splendid ban
quet to-night In honor of Francis Joseph's
presence at the Kaiserhof. '.Â¦â¢?Â¦

Comment of: the Press.

Emperor William's and Emperor Francis
Joseph's toasts last, evening, are unani
mous in declaring that their utterances

acter of the dreibund- before the world.

Newark, N. J., took Peruna for extreme
nervousness, she fays: "I was very ill
and thought I would die.' I had a terrible
headache and my head swam: I thought I
would never get well: I seemed to have a
Rreat complication of diseases, and bought
medicines, but they did me no good.
"Finally I gave up and thought I would
wait for the end. Ono day I happened to
pick up one of your books. I read of other
women who were near death and had heen
cured by Peruna, so I thought I would try
it. - ,
"I took a couple of bottles and
began to fee! better. I continued
its use until now I am a well
woman. 1 praise Peruna highly
and wish other women would use
it."
So many housewives suffer from ner-
vous depression, due to catarrhal weak-
ness peculiar to their sex, and suffer on
year after year, not knowing what their
ailment is. Mrs. Mary Cook of Pittsford,
N'. Y., suffered for six years before sh<9
learned of Peruna. Mrs. Cook recently
wrote the following letter to Dr. Hurt-
man: - - .
"I' was not well for six years,
paid many doctor bills, but never
improved very much. I gave up
hopes of ever recovering.
"Finally I wrote to Dr. Hartman. and I
am thankful to say that I am now well,
through his good advice and medicine. I
am gaining in fie^h and feel young again.
I was very emaciated, but now my own
children are surprised in the great change
in me when they visit me."
Mrs. Anna Roes, 2813 North Fifth street.
Philadelphia, Pa., writes:
" Four weeks ago I believed I
had consumption : I took a severe
cold* and although for the first
few days the mucus in my throat
and chsst was loose, it finally
became so bad that I had dif-

"Pain in the shoulders followed. As I

ORDER ISSUED FOR
TRANSFER OF OTIS
Since the beginning of the insurrection
General Otis has kept at his desk from
early morning until midnight. He has
never been seen on the luneta, like the
other officers, and only two or three times
has he been seen in society, and these oc
casions were semi-official receptions. The
general leaves the army admirably organ
ized, provisioned and clothed.
During the morning the Supreme Court
Judges and many officers called at the
palace to bid farewell to General Otis,
who kept at work with his accustomed
energy until the moment of leaving.
The Governor's launch left the palace at
4 o'clock, cairj'ing General Otis and Gen
eral MacArthur's staffs to the Meade. The
Twentieth and Fourteenth Infantry,
drawn up ashore In front of the city wall,
presented arms and the bands played
"Auld Lang Syne," while ashore the bat
tery saluted.

TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, May 5.â
Judge Advocate General Lleber has con
firmed the right of a commanding gen
eral of a division of the Philippines to dis
miss an officer of his command upon sen
tence of court-martial. This decision car
ries with it recognition of the existence
of a state of war in the Philippines. It
probably means the death blow to the ef
forts of friends of four officers dismissed
from the service for misconduct in the
archipelago, though the President may be
prevailed upon to interfere. The officers
whose cases are pending before the de
partment are: Major George W. Kirk
man of the Forty-ninth Infantry. First
Lieutenant C. J. Bailey of the Twenty

The plaintiff was married to Miss Dayan
In San Francisco about eighteen years
ago, and their union formed a notable so
cial event. Mrs. Overacker was formerly
exceedingly fond of dress and wore many
costumes that were the envy of the ladles
In her set. For reasons unknown, the
couple did not agree on all points neces
sary to domestic harmony, and a few
years after the marriage gossipy tongues
began to whisper that the god of love
had been dethroned in the Overacker
household.
A few years ago Mrs. Overacker created
quite a sensation by embracing the Cath
olic religion and announcing her intention
of devoting her life to religious and char
itable work. It was about three years
ago that she became rather eccentric and

of the members having held public office
and taken a keen interest in their local
town affairs. The plaintiff was at one time
a deputy county clerk.

In a Restaurant.
A physician puts the query: Hare you
never noticed In any large restaurant at
lunch or dinner time the large number of
hearty, vigorous old men at the tables;
men whose ages run from 60 to 80 years,
many of them bald and all perhaps gray,
but none of them feeble or senile?
Perhaps the spectacle Is so common as
to have escaped your observation or com-
ment, but nevertheless It Is an object les-
son which means something.
If you will notice .what these hearty old
fellows are eating you will observe that
they are not munching bran crackers nor
gingerly picking their way through a
menu card of new fangled health foods;
on the contrary, they seem to prefer a
Juicy roast of beef, a properly turned loin
of mutton and even the deadly broiled lob-
ster is not altogether ignored. r
The point of all this Is that a vigorous
old age depends upon good digestion and
plenty of wholesome food, and not upon
dieting and an endeavor to live upon bran
crackers.
There is a certain class of food cranks
who seem to believe that meat, coffee and
many other good things are rank poisons,
but these cadaverous, sickly looking Indi-
viduals are a walking condemnation of
their own theories.
The matter In a nutshell is that If the
stomach secretes the natural digestive
Juices in sufficient quantity any whole-
some food will be promptly digested; if
the stomach does not do so, and certain
foods cause distress one or two of Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets after each meal will re-
move all difficulty, because they supply
Just what every weak stomach lacks, pep-
sin, hydrochloric acid, diastase and nux.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets do not act
upon the bowels, and In fact are not
strictly a medicine, as they act almost en-
tirely upon the food eaten, digesting it
thoroughly, and thus give a much needed
rest, and giving an appetite for the next
meal.
Of people who travel nine out ot ten use
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, knowing them
to be perfectly safe to use at any time,
and also having found out by experience
that they are a safeguard against indi-
gestion in any form, and eating, as they
have to, at all hours and all klnda of
food, the traveling public for years hava
pinned their faith to Stuart's Tablets
All druggists sell them at 50 cents for
full sized packages, and any druggist from
Maine to California, if his opinion were
asked, will say that Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablet* is the most popular and successful
remedy for any stomach trouble.

Special "Dtei>atch to The Call.
SAN JOSE. May 5.â During the past
few nights this city has been visited by
vast showers of beetles, followed by
myriads of birds, which were evidently
attracted by the bright lights of the thou
sands of candle power on the big electric
light tower. No one has yet. been able to
account for this phenomenon. This strange
visitation of bugs and birds has been no
ticed at- long intervals in previous years,
but never in such numbers. The tower
had not been lighted for nearly a year
until recently. About 11. o'clock at night
the beetles made their appearance and
the sky was thick with them.
These were followed shortly after by

way through the business districts to

parade the crowds were so great that the
police were utterly helpleea and dozens of
cruised and fainting women and crying
children were rescued only by the use of
clubs. In some instances the helpless ones
being carried out over the heads of the j
almost Immovable mass of people. In
front of the grand stand at the exposi

control of a hundred policemen, and for
an hour before the parade reached that ;
point packed the street from curb to curb i

passageway for the parade finally being ;
cleared with great difficulty.
Over the entire length of the line of

Cranmore. Cal. The slavery agitation had
apparently died away In Congress and
throughout . the country. The calm was
doomed to sudden Interruption. Prospect
of beneficial legislation was destroyed by
the Introduction of a measure which at
once supplanted all other subjects In Con
gress and in the political interests of the
people. That was the novel and, astound
ing proposal of Senator Stephen A. Doug
las of Illinois In relation to the Kansas
and Nebraska Territories. The measure
was a provision In the bill for the organi
zation of a Territory In Nebraska declar
ing that the States which might at any
future time be formed In the new Terri
tory should leave the question of slavery
to be decided by the inhabitants thereof
on the adoption of their constitution. That
provision was. as explained In the bill It
self, the application of the compromise pol
icy of 1S50 to Nebraska, and. as was evi
dent, virtually repealed the Missouri com
promise of 182O.which guaranteed that sla
very should forever be- excluded from tha
territory In question.

When the Pacific Mail Steamship Company in
sisted that its Mongolian boarding-house on the dock
is "constructively" the deck of a vessel the scheming

not be known, as are their fellows already in China

If the claims of Chinese "merchants" who are
boarding on the Pacific Mail Dock awaiting admis
sion to San Francisco be true, all China must be a
huge grocery. Thousands of "grocers" have already
been admitted, and 137, who arrived on the Coptic,
arc now at the door.
Following out to its logical conclusion what ap

perience of Sullivan alley.
The Market Street Railway Company has promised
the Board of Public Works that the law in reference

Probably the very interesting fact that the law pro

remarkable exhibition of corporation virtue.
FASHION HINT FROM PARIS.
ONE of the best methods of measuring prosper
ity in the United States is by noting the com
parative railway construction of one year with
that of another. When times are good a rapid ex
tension of our railway mileage goes on, but when any
thing mars the business condition of the country rail
way enterprises lag and the amount of construction is
slight. The San Joaquin Valley road was probably
the only notable venture ever made in the way of
building an extensive new railroad in a time of indus
trial depression and financial panic, and that was suc
cessful only because the money to construct was
forthcoming in San Francisco itself and : thcre was no
necessity to sell bonds in Eastern or foreign markets.
, Judged by that standard of measurement the pros
perity of the country now is at its highest pitch.
Something like a year ago the Railway Age pub
lished a long list of railroads under construction or
projected, and from that data estimated that the total
mileage during the year 1899 would be about 4000.
The estimate was a sanguine one, and yet it fell short
of what was accomplished. The final figure? for the
work of the year show that our railways were. in-,
creased during the time by 4588 miles. /"; .
Despite the fact that we are to be in the turmoil
of a Presidential election, the present year promises
even better results than last year. In a recent issue
the Railway Age gave the summary of lines now un
der construction, or projected, as follows:
Lines. Miles.
New England States 13 â¢ 447
Middle States 112 2.440
Scuth Atlantic States 177 \ 9.752
Gulf and Mississippi Valley States.. 115 6,789 ~
Central Northern States ! 112 5.623
Northwestern States .....' 80 6,197
Southwestern States 167 21,207
Pacific States 10S 6,377
Of course the whole of that immense mileage will
not be completed during the year, and probably much
of it will never be undertaken. The Railway Age in:
commenting upon it says: "It is an easy matter to
take out a charter for a new company, but it is quite
another thing to raise the money with which to build;
the road.. Many of the charters cover practically
j parallel lines, and it is impossible to tell which stand
best show of being carried to comoletion. -SntnleT

Thus do our Judges make way for justice in a
crowded and jostling world. No woman who wears
false hair can get damages for breach of; promise by
a man whom her hair has deceived; no woman can
be made to work if she objects; no street car con
ductor can make a passenger, move forward. This is
a land of liberty, and justice also makes it her abode.
The third case is for the benefit of both men and
women. A Milwaukee man refused to obey, the com
mand of a street car conductor to move forward in a
crowded car and make more room. The conductor
put him off the car and the man sued for damages.
The Judge held that a passenger on a street car who
has secured standing-room can no more be moved
about at the conductor's wi^l to serve. the convenience
of passengers getting on later than can the fortunate"
persons who manage to obtain a seat. The only ex
ception, in the Judge's opinion, was when the stand
ing passenger blocked the doorway.
If the decision in that case appear to the ladies to
be unfair, they can find consolation in this: In Chi
cago a woman was arrested for vagrancy, under an act
which defines a vagrant as "a person who is idle, re
mains idle and refuses to work." The Judge held that
the statute does not apply to women, as in the eye of
the law "it is no part of the duty of women to work."
Three judgments recently pronounced may be cited
as illustrations of the way things are going. In one
case it is stated that an Iowa man proposed marriage
to a young woman and was accepted, but hearing that
her hair was false he declined to fulfill his engagement.
She brought suit against him for breach of promise,
and, being put on the stand, admitted that she wore
a wig, whereupon she was nonsuited on the ground
' that she had won the young man's affections under
false pretenses.
OUR complex civilization is continually evolving
new conditions in the relations of the com
' ponent parts of society to "one another, and
consequently our Judges are kept awake at nights de
vising ways and means of so applying the laws of the
land as to do justice in the novel cases of strife and
conflict that come before them. <Â¦ Hence we are get
ing new decisions every day on matters of interest to
the public as well as to lawyers, and it behooves the
people to pay attention to them.
SOME NEW LAW POINTS.
Because the House of Representatives refused to
appropriate any money for a pneumatic tube service
by the Postoffice Department, the press of the cities
where such service was desired declare the action to
be a proof of the incapacity of governmental bodies;
but, on the other hand, a good many authorities as
sert that to have made such an appropriation would
have been a job of the worst kind. So having to face
a charge of incapacity on one side and jobbery on the
other, perhaps the action of the House was the best
it could do.
One of the curious features of the war in South
Africa is the obscurity of Kitchener; he seems to
have been hidden under a Uushel somewhere, but per
haps he is just laying low and waiting for Roberts to
get out of his way.
In presenting this issue anew to the people the bank
ers have conferred a public service. As the excite
ments of the approaching Presidential election in
crease and national issues absorb more and more of
popular attention, the danger of overlooking State
issues increases. It is therefore important to have this
question impressed upon the minds of the voters
whenever occasion serves. To that end all conventions
representing any class of citizens ought to give it con
sideration at their meetings. It is too serious an issue
to be ignored. The campaign of education upon the
need of the amendment should be continuous and per
sistent, so that when election day comes all voters
Â¦will understand the meaning of the amendment and
vote for it.
By the adoption of the resolution the bankers have
directed public attention once more to one of the
most important State q;:cstions which will be sub
mitted to the people at the coming election. The
evil results of taxing public bonds have long been
fe!t, and steps have been taken to apply a remedy.
At the November election there will be submitted an
amendment to the State constitution providing a new
section for article XIII, to read: "All bonds here
after issued by the State of California, or by any
county, city and cour.ty, municipal corporation or
district (including school, reclamation and irrigation
districts) within taid State shall be free and exempt
from taxation." If the amendment be adopted a
double benefit will be derived. In the first place it
v:\\\ be possible to negotiate public bonds on better
terms, and in the second place California capitalists
can afford to invest in such bonds, and we will thus
be saved the annual drain of money sent outside the
State to pny interest, which would have to be done if
the bonds were in the hands of outside holders.
AMONG the resolutions adopted by the conven
tion of the State Bankers' Association at Sac
ramento on Friday was one declaring: "That
the taxation of State, county and municipal bonds,
including school districts, is without resulting bene
fits, but prolific of evil, as it occasions the loss of
money to taxpayers, depreciates public and private
credit, impairs respect for the law, and lessens the
public conception of the sanctity of an oath; where
fore the convention recommends that the constitution
of the State be so amended as to exempt public se
curities from taxation."

PERSONAL MENTION.
From these accounts it appears the drought
that has been a blight upon the State for so long a
time has now been brought to an end. The central
and northern sections of the State had abundant rains
during the winter, and now the south has had its
share. California throughout her confines will re
gain that high plane of prosperity which is her normal
condition and become once more attractive to home
seekers from all parts of the country.
Los Angeles is not the only county that has profited
by the showers. The reports add: "The rain to-day
has saved the corn crop in its entirety and has done
similar service for deciduous and citrus fruits in
Southern California, and for beans in Ventura.
Loose hay lying out may be somewhat damaged, but
the good to other products will make the damage,
whatever it may be, a small matter. The mountains
are everywhere covered with snow, which assures an
abundant water supply for irrigation."
Dispatches from Los Angeles giving the record of
the rainfall up to 5 p. in. Friday say: "As one of the
results of the present storm the sugar factories at Ox
nard and Los Alamitos will both be operated during
the coming season on full time. This means that
nearly $2,000,000 will from this source alone be dis
tributed in and about Los Angeles during the coming
summer. Had the dry weather continued the Los
Alamitos factory would probably not have been oper
ated this year at all. The last rain assured a partial
crop of beets and the storm of last night and to-day
guarantees that a complete crop of beets will be har
vested."
Of the rains of the winter the south had but an in
adequate share. Hardly sufficient water fell to break
the effects of the long' drought, and it looked as if
another bad season would depress the rural industries
of that section. Now, however, all is changed.
Spring has compensated for the lack of winter rain
fall. Reports from nearly all parts of the south are
to the effect that the recent showers have saved the
situation. All prospects now promise good crops,
and the people are jubilant.
SACRAMENTO people, viewing the glories of
their street fair dripping wet and showing
draggled and drooping under cloudy skies, may
for a time regret the rain. When they turn away
from the view of their own streets, however, to note
the exultant rejoicing in other places where the show
ers fell, they will find ample consolation for the little
loss they may have sustained. The showers, in fact,
have been a benefit to the State at large, and in the
southern counties the benefit has been so considerable
as to amount to a veritable blessing.
THE RfllNS IN THE SOUTH-
In his exile at St. Helena Cronje has the satis
faction of knowing that one of his sons is still in the
Boer army and making it evident to the British that
the family hasn't been whipped simply because the old
man has surrendered.
To such a pitch of extravagance has the craze for putting pampered canine pets into costumes gone in La Belle'
France that swell dogs now have all the elaborate articles shown above and much more beside. Doggie's complexion
'is protected from the sun by a parasol, his dainty nose is wiped on real cambric handkerchiefs, and he has numerous
changes of linen. The pampering of pet dogs has reached a stage that is causing American visitors to wonder whether,
or not Parisian women are becoming hopelessly f.ighty. The canine costumer has become an established institution,,
and now there is actually to be published a dog's directory, giving the names and addresses of the aristocratic pets,<
their pedigrees, distinguishing .qualities and reception days. .;â¢

In the Capitol building are many mural paintings
and inscriptions. We have to suggest that among
them be put this:
Then the gentleman from Kentucky and gentlemen
from several other States rose to their feet and im
plored the Speaker to procure order. But the Speaker
is a parliamentary grammarian. He knows the value
of the subjunctive, and so calmly assured the excited
House that he had heard no unparliamentary lan
guage. Mr. Cannon asked Colonel Hepburn to re
peat his remark. The Colonel repeated. The pres
ence of the order inspiring "if was duly observed
and the House became as quiet as a lone fisherman.
Next day the vitriolic Chandler of New Hampshire
and the argentiferous Stewart of Nevada confronted
each other in the Senate in a torrid way that prom
ised lurid results. Chandler objected to what he
called Stewart's threat to read the three large volumes
of testimony in the Clark case to the Senate. The
two Senators seemed on the verge of shedding ora
tory on the subject when an examination of Stewart's
remarks disclosed the presence of the dove-like -sub
junctive. He had said that "if time were not given to
examine the voluminous record of legislative virtue
in Montana he would read it in the Senate. There
upon peace fell with all four feet upon the august
chamber. Father Pettus fell asleep again, Cockrell
assumed the Brother Jonathan attitude in which he
takes his naps, while the galleries think he is thinking,
and the drowsy goddess of dignity took charge of tlic
floor.
These two came together on the banks of the
Nicaragua canal discussion, and Cannon's temper got
its tail over the lines and "imputed" things to Colonel
Hepburn. Thereupon the Colonel's temper put it3
armor on and in genuine Hawkeye dudgeon said: "If
the gentleman from Illinois assume personal responsi
bility for that imputation he has lied."
Mr. Cannon of Illinois has a temper that was
brought up. on plug tobacco, and has it always with
him. and also that on which it grows. Colonel Hep
burn of Iowa has a temper that was weaned on a cob
pipe and cannot go to sleep without it, as a child
raised on a bottle can be comforted only by putting
the familiar piece of glassware in its hands.
The bright and particular part of speech se
lected as a buffer is the subjunctive mode. The other
moods and tenses and verbal and adverbal attributes
have their uses, but when it comes to averting vio
lence, whether a fisticuff or a duel, a mere rough
house or an assassination, there is no quality of noun,
verb, adjective or preposition equal to the subjunc
tive. Prepositions may govern certain cases, but the
subjunctive governs the House and Senate.
It is in such riotous times that the beneficent struc
ture of the English language serves as a balm of
Gile.id to tbe sore places in *the Congressional
Last week the spring fever was on at Washington.
Members of Congress fidget as the sap runs up under
their bark. There is abroad an appetite for dandelion
greens and tansy bitters, and the disposition to be
peppery in taking and giving offense is so general
that the presiding officers of the two houses have a
hard lime, and the sergeant-at-arms keeps his awe
inspiring official mace well dusted, for there is no tell
ing at what moment its dreadful and peace compelling
presence may be required to repress disorder and re
mind the members that although Congressmen they
are still gentlemen, notwithstanding that handicap.
THE English language has been built up. Its
material has been quarried out of the ruins of
other languages, as modern Athens and mod
ern Rome owe their walls largely to the stone taken
out of the ruins of ancient structures that had long
lain in amorphous heaps on the ground. This Eng
lish tongue as it has been built up by accretions has
been adapted to the modern age, in which it is a
vehicle, a carryall and buckboard of human thought.
Its growth has been cotemporaneous with the growth
of parliamentary government, and the world is often
called to admire the accommodation of the language
to the emergencies which arise in parliamentary ex
perience.
THE VflLUfJBLE SUBJUNCTIVE.
The construction of 5000 miles of additional railway
means good business and big business. The work
will call for raw material of almost all kinds, and then
the equipment of the new roads with engines and cars
will keep the factories at work. Each new road,
moreover, will add to the business activity of the
country it traverses and of the cities and towns to
which it supplies transportation service. It will be
seen, then, that the construction of the roads is full of
promise for all parts of the Union. It is going to be
a good year for everybody except the calamity howler.
will never get beyond the preliminary stage, while
others will make some surveys and probably .': do ' a
little grading, with the hope of securing local aid, and
then disappear from public notice. .-... . If- the
same ratio be applied to 1909 as to 1899 there will
be 5000 miles of road completed during the, current
year, and it will not be surprising if the figure exceeds
that amount."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CAI/L, SUNDAY, MAY 6, 190O.
ONCLE SAJI'S Stars and Stripes were flying from all of the municipal build
ings and nearly all of the commercial houses of San Francisco yesterday.
This was one means of expressing the gratification of the general public at
the successful passage of the Nicaragua canal bill by the House of Rep
resentatives at Washington. In business circles It was one- of the main subjects
of conversation, hundreds of merchants rejoicing that there is hope of escape from
the monopoly of the railroad through the waterway of the Central American coun
try. The general belief is that the bill will not fall to pass the Senate, especially
after the general commendation of the action of the House.
More than one of the business men it this city said yesterday: "We want the
canal, fortifications or no fortifications."
Of the local commercial bodies none have taken so much interest In the canal
project as the Chamber of Commerce, the members of that organization having
worked for the great waterway for years. That they are more than pleased with
the success so far achieved Is manifest by the following dispatch sent by the
president to Hon. John T. Morgan, who did such heroic work for the measure:

A Plan for Electric Power and Light
to Be Developed From Amer
ican River.
â¢ A plan was yesterday. submitted, to the
Board of Supervisors'by J. E. Russell for
supplying this city with water, electric
power and light from the Junction of the
north and middle forks of the American
River, one mile from Auburn. Russell
says he owns 820 acres of land in Placer
and El Dorado counties on both sides of
the river. He estimates the cost of the
water 'system at $4,104,579, of an electric
power Bystem at $584,184 and of an electric
railway 118 miles long, from Auburn to
San Francisco, at $754,669. or $5,443,432 for
the three systems. In the dryest weather
the American River at the point men
tioned carries never leBS than 10,000
miner's Inches. Lake Tahoe being but
three miles away, the supply of water
could be increased by running a tunnel
five miles long under the lake.*
Russell proposes that two steel, water
pipes, each forty-eight inches in diameter,
be laid along the Central Pacific Railroad.
From a dam 1050 feet above the sea a
flow of 60,000,000 gallons could be ; dellv
ered,daily to this city. It-la intended to
devlop 5000 horsepower in the lighting and

ST. MARY'S PARK FUND
WILL PAY OFF DEFICIT
Tacit Understanding Between Audi
tor and Supervisors That Money
Will Be So Utilized.
As outlined in these columns three
months ago it is now stated that the Su
pervisors' Finance Committee and the
Auditor have come to a tacit agreement
that the Â£t. Mary's Park fund of $125,000
will be used to pay of! the deficit with
which the city will be confronted at the
end of the fiscal year.
The fund will not be used until I after
June 30, when it will be applied to paying
off claims of creditors. Notwithstanding
the efforts of the officials to make up the
deficiency of $211,000 by shutting off lights
and oy other me:.ns, it Is believed that
there will remain bills amounting to at
least $100,000, for which there will not be
a cent of money in the treasury unless
the St. Mary's Park fund is utilized.

Commissioners is destined to have at least
one more fight on Us hands should It at
tempt to Interfere with the temporary
appointments in the Auditor's ofllce. Au
ditor Wells said yesterday that he will
refuse to submit to any arbitrary action
on the part of the commission.
With the assistance of. Mayor Phelan
the commission recently succeeded in
whipping Kacorder Godchaux into line
when that official rebelled against throw
ing out his copyists, whom he had tem
porarily appointed for a period of sixty
days, to make room for others who had
been fortunate enough to pass the exam
ination. Though Godchaux submitted to
the dictates of the Mayor and commission
he has always felt that their action was
rather high-handed and that he was un
justly treated. The fact therefore that
one city official at least Intends to test
the right of . the Civil Service Board to
dictate his appointments will no doubt be
cheering news to the Recorder.
Auditor Wells outlined his position In
the matter yesterday by first saying that
he had no desire to enter into any con
flict with the commission, but that If it
forced the issue he would take the case
to the courts. In a few weeks the Auditor
will have the appointment of some fifty
extra clerks, whose duty it will bÂ« to cal
culate the taxes on the assessment roll as
returned by the Assessor.
"When the time conies," said Mr. TV ells,
"I shall send my list of appointees to the
Civil Service Commission, with a notifica
tion that 1 have appointed them for a
period of sixty days. The charter gives
me this power, but the appointments must
receive the approval of the Civil Service
Commissioners. Should they return their
approval, all well and good. But they are
likely to withhold their sanction ilnd In
sist that I select the names from a 1 list of
eligibles furnished by them. In that event
I will immediately bring suit to enjoin
them from Interfering in any way with
the administration of my office and thus
determine whether I have any rights In
the matter.

QUARTERMASTERS THE
BOSSES ON TRANSPORTS
Captain Pierce Turned Down for Dis
obeying Orders Given at Sea
by Captain Coulling.
The transfer of Captain Pierce from the
transport Sheridan to the Warren Is
taken by the officers of the service to
mean another victory for the military
authority aboard transports over the
masters of the vessels in the service.
The row between Captain Pierce, mas
ter of the Sheridan, and Captain Coul-
Iing-, army quartermaster in charge of the
transport, occurred at sea only a few
days before the vessel reached port on
her last trip from Manila. The story goes
that Captain Couiling sent orders to Cap
tain Pierce to open certain hatches and
take out the trunks of some of the of
ficers who were passengers. Captain
Pierce refused to comply. Captain Coul
lin& retaliated by placing the little skip
per under arrest, but only for a few
hours, as he was subsequently Induced by
others on the ship to pursue a milder pol
icy.
When the Sheridan reached port there
were charges and counter charges pre
ferred, and Colonel Long held an investi
gation. Nothing was made public con
cerning the result, but the fact that Cap
tain Pierce was transferred to another
ship instead of the quartermaster is ac
cepted by transport officers as evidence
that the army got the better of the con
troversy.
It has developed that persons with
esthetic tastes to satisfy do not need to
go beyond the Rockies In order to gratify
their most acute desires. Chaa. M.
Plum & Co. have turned out a piano that
should and will attract the attention of
any person interested in such work.
It was bullded to order and for the
purpose of fitting a room furnished by the
rtrm after the fashion of Louis XV. So
artistic and delicate is this piece of work
that at first observation it appears frail,
but close examination shows that the
carving Is all handwork upon solid wood,
all of it having been done In their own
factory in San Francisco. The body of
the case is in a special shade of olive
green, while the carving is overlaid with
pure gold leaf. The case was decorated
by one of our best artists, who worked
at the task for months. The design of
this painting, which was successfully ac
complished in oil upon a smooth surface,
is especially soft and artistic and is fol
lowed in "the construction of the music
cabinet and bench.
The writer, during years of travel In
Eastern and foreign countries, has never
seen a more beautiful piano case and San
Francisco can congratulate herself that
it was manufactured here.

will not be a picnic camp; that during
their stay on Laveaga Heights at Santa
Cruz there will not be any of the work
that can be performed In the armories or
on the public streets; that there will be
but little of four rights and four lefts ex
cept in marching; that there will not be
any reviews or dress parade, but that the
work will be in the line of extended or
ders, reconnoitering. fleld exercise, scout
duty, defense and attack, hasty intrench
ment, reports on the condition of the
country to be Invaded, roads, map mak
ing and all that will tend to make the

Californians Defeated.
RENO. Nev., May 5.â In the game of
basket ball played here this afternoon be
fwÂ»en the Vniverslty of Xevada team and
the Palo Alto team the game resulted In
a victory for Nevada by a score of 4 to 2.
LOXDOX, May a.â At the Catford Cycle
festival to-day T. J. Gascoyne broke the
quarter-mile record with flyine start, po
lng the distance in 25 2-H seconds. He also
broke the mile pursuit record, covering
the distance in 2:05 1-5.
Cydlcfr Records Lowered.
He won race after race in California
without training, and now that he is con
ditioning himself I believe, he will ride
as the superior of any of them. Stevens
is a good man, but Freeman is the best
finisher. For my own part, I shall go
into middle distance racing aÂ« well as
into sprint racing, and we shall ride a
motor together."
McFarland and Stevens and Freeman
and Downing will form two of the fastest
motoeycle teams in the East this year.
Motocycle racing will be the money
maker. ,
All of the Callfornians are more than
delighted with the outlook for the year.
Their engagements are already many. It
is their intention to complete their train,
ing at Louisville by May 30, when they
will scatter through tHe Eastern terri
tory for a number of; mhtch races now
being arranged. At the close of the grand
circuit they, with a number of the more
prominent Eastern men, will work back
across the country to California.
At the close of the races big McFarland
was asked for an opinion regarding the
season. "We are after the money," said
he, "and Stevens is after the champion
ship He will win it, too. They can't
stop him. He is riding a bicycle to win
and Is heavier and stronger this year
than ever. 1 shall go after the big races
myself and let the championship title go
to my partner. 1 am in racing for the
middle distances and for sprinting and
all around work. All of the big money
this year will be sought by me, and I
have every reason to believe that the
season for our team will be the best ; we
ever experienced." .1 .
Hardy Downing spoke for himself and
Freeman. "Howard Freeman." said he.
"is the fastest man in the bunch to-day.
The Golden Gate quartet consists of
Floyd A. McFarland, San Jose, the han
dicap king; Howard Freeman. Bay City
Wheelmen, San Francisco; Hardy Down
ing, San Jose, the ranchman; and Or
lando Stevens, San Jose. The latter
hailed originally from Iowa, but Is to
marry in San Jose next winter and set
tle there. He has wintered in Santa Clara
County for several seasons and registers
regularly from California. This quartet
of noted riders has been in daily training
for the past two weeks at Fountain Fer
ry. True, they came from the race tracks
of California prepared almost for the sea
son, all excepting McFarland. Neverthe
less there were others in condition and
prepared to dispute the right of the men'
of the West to claim the earth. At the
close of the first meet the other riders
"guessed" that they were wrong. The
Golden Gate quartet won the gold han
dily and showed a clean pair of heels to
Tom Cooper and many more noted riders,
there being about twenty competitors.
Ziegler and C. 8. Wells prevail at Denver
back in 1894.
B. F. \Vakefl>ld.
This closing dcy of the long racing sea
roa tvsp no different from any ordinary
Cay with the regulars. In a well planned
f.ank rriovoment on the bookmakers they
wre rouud wiih disastrous results, tix
cf the sfVf-n first choices being laid low.
Tlio race for gentlemen riders, of course,
attracted the most attention from select
circles. Romanv, the mount of Mr. Skin
j cr, "was injiallrri favorite on the strength
cf that horseman's wc-ll-known ability.
Sir. Bates of Oakland had the leg up on
Socialist and, to the vroe of the favorite**
backers, won caUopIng. The bay gelding
seemed to have tuddf>:ily retrained his best
form, 'or tli^ 179 pounds rented lightly on
hi? la<k. and despite ilr. Skinner's efforts
on the favorite the mount of Mr. Bates
won gmiiinj;. Mr. Pugh landed Monita
third, a head lirfore Duke of York. For
this race Thama> H. Williams Jr. replaced
J. B. Ferguson in the starter's box. The
president of the track over the bay used
e starting flasr of white bearing a blue
cross en the Ji^'d. sending the riders away
eimost perfectly aligned.
A field cf fieVMi started in the Fablola
Derby, over a mile, with La Borgia clos-^
Ing favorite. After Linger had showed
the v/ay to the stretch the nrst choice
loomed "up prominently, only to be col
lared and beaten out by Kxpedient, third
In demand. Bogus lii'A was third.
From 6 to 1 Joe Mussle was hacked
Bxtxnt to 3 to 1 favoritism in the betting
on the r>j.Â»ei:ing evt-r.t. Tfcose he had to
beat wore a ragged assortment and it
proved an easy v.in. Aunt Bird took the
place from Majesty.
Nettie Clark vent to the post favorite
â¢for the live-furlor.g sprint following and
vres outfooted from thp Jump by Favorito.
The winner, a bay gelding by Emperor
of Norfolk-Los Angeles, was quoted at
lf> to 1 In the books. Show honors went
to Formattis.
Johnny Campbell's Twlnkler had a big
following""!!! the speculating done on the
Owners' handicap, at one and three-quar
ter miles. Taking- the lead from Coda.
ni.pn headed for home the second time,
Gaffney on the Campbell entry saved no
frround. losing by three lengths to Gaunt
et. Buchanan on the winner put up a
perfect ride.
To the peculiar riding of Shields could
be attributed the downfall of Diderot, fa
vorite for the two-year-old dash. Moon
foripht rerrived the nomination, only to
be nosed out by Andrattus, a 5 to 1 shot.
Diderct finished "third. The winner was
bid up SoW over his selling price by J.
Weber, ov.ner of Moonbright.
With the smart money bet on High
Hoe and Dc-coy In the closing chapter
Torsina. a 12 to 1 shot, came in "on the
bit." Mounce can win on these kind, but
meets with hard luck on fa%*orites. High
Hoe was second, two lengths before De-
Track Notes.
Presiding Judge Joseph A. Murphy and
family left for St. Louis last evening. Mr.
Murphy will as usual preside In the stand
at the coming race meet in that city.
E. C. Hopper, tissooiate Judge at Oak
land, will leave for Covington, Ky., to^
day.
The stewards at the track over the bay
have reinstated Jockey Coburn, suspended
eome months ago. The ban was also lift
ed from Ruiz. F. J. O'Rourke, ruled off
the turf in October last, was also restored
to rood standing.
After investigating the running of the
mare Sly. the Tanforan stewards finally
reached a decision yesterday. W. C.
Hardir.gr. alias "Red": GÂ«orge P. Moore.
Lee Merritt. atlas "Blue Belle": Richard
Roe. alias "Smiling Gimpy"; John Doe
and "the Kid" were ruled off the turf.
Trainer Tommy Leeper, whose confession
Implicated the ruled off persons, still
stands suspended, some of his statements
being questioned. Bookmaker Caesar
Young was exonerated from any connec
tion with the matter.

will be decided to-day.
Following are the day's result*, with
Judge P. J. Relily's official scores:
In the rundown of the open stake at In
glesldo Coursing Park yesterday a lively
lot of hares gave the hounds some hart!
runs, and the turning loose of relief dogs
was resorted to In several Instances.
Form players have been at sea lately,
the courses being of such short duration
on account of slow hares that form has
not counted for much. â¢
Ripple was pitted against Clan, a San
Jose doff, and, slipped to a fast hare,
worked herself out and will probably bÂ«
withdrawn from the stake. The course
lasted tnree minutes, and three relief dogs
were In the chase before the hare was
killed.
Flyaway went to the slips quite lame,
and though she beat Delia M she had to
be carried from the field. No bets were
sold on the event. Golden Garter, the
runner-up In last week's stake, showed,
the effects of his hard work In that event
and lost to Remus, a 2 to 5 short-ender.
Pleasant Girl, on the short end at 1 to 3.
beat out Snapper Garrison in a long. hard,
race. Pleasant Girl had the speed ana
showed better work, beating out the -win
ner of the last open stake In clever style.
McNeil's Black Hawk In a Ion* course
beat Healy's Martn. Much excitement
was given the spectators, as the entire
course was run directly In front of the
grand stand.
Rusty Gold, Mamie Pleasant and St.
Anthony are looked uJJon as winners in,
the first 'tie to-day and stand a good
chance to get In the finals. St. Anthony a
position on the card and his known speed
favor him as a stake winner. In addition
to the finals a slxteen-dogf champion stake

HOUNDS ARE PUT
TO HARD TESTS
By FAST HARES
NARCISSUS, THE
STAKE FAVORITE,
HAS A LONG RUN
A Hare Takes Him Three
Minutes at Union
Park.
Curtis & Son's Narcissus, looked upon
as the fastest greyhound in the stake at
Union Coursing Park yesterday, drew the
strongest hare of the day. The long
cared flyer from the Merced plains ran
for 3 minutes and 5 seconds before It
finally succumbed, j Up to the end neither
Narcissus nor Honor Bright, which was
( running with him. could get within strik
ing distance of the hare. Both grey
hounds were distressed from the unusual
efforts they put forth. The course Is ex
pected to have a bad effect on Narcissus
If he Is started to-day In the second
round of the stake.
The Curtis crack was not the only fa
vorite- sent to the kennels. Agamemnon, a
2 to 1 favorite, was beaten by R. E. de B.
Lopez's good young dog Diablo. Beauty
Spot beat Morning Glory, at 5 to 3; Lord
Byron beat Commodore, 3 to 1; Cash beat
Statesman, 5 to 3; Soft Goods beat Hur
ricane, 5 to 1; Scottish Chief beat Victor
Boy, 2 to 1: Blackette beat Belle Clalr,
3 to 1; Whisky Hill beat Terrona, 3 to 1.
and Alex beat Go On, 2Y 2 to 1.
In the lone odds book For Glory and
Whitehead are held at 3 to 1; Brutus, 4;
Thomhill and Forest King. 5; Sleety Mist.
Rock Island King and Little Sister. 6;
Beauty Spot and Blackette, 8, and Cash,
Forest Queen and Erin, 10 to 1.
The trials throughout the day were gen
erally good ones, the hares continuing
strong and fleet of foot. Curtis & Son's
Anchor, a Skyrocket-Vanity Fair puppy,
showed promising form, defeating May
Herschel handily. Firm Foe led Julius
Caesar four lengths. May Queen defeated
Corin's Flashlight and is expected to run
well into the stake and with ordinary
coursing luck have matters comparatively
easy for several rounds.

Grace's official scores, follow:

Noted Greyhound Arrives.
The last of the royally bred greyhounds
purchased by J. H. Rosseter In England
arrived, here yesterday. There were two
in the consignment, but chief Interest cen
ters about a two-year-old dot; which was
imported chiefly for his running qualities.
He is called The Royal Star and is by the
great dog Falconer, out of Queen of the-
Fens. He has won a number of important
stakes, showing a great flight of speed.
He will be run at Union Park as soon as
he becomes acclimated.

JEFFRIES VS. CORBETT.
Championship Contest to Take Place
Next Friday Night.
NEW YORK. May 5.â It has been set
tled that^the heavy-weight contest be
tween Jim 1 Jeffries and James J. Corbett
will be decided at the Seaside Sporting
Club, Coney Island, next Friday night. It
is announced that Jeffries will weigh not
less than 212 pounds when he enters the
ring. Corbett will weigh about 190 pounds.
Metropolitan by FlHgrane, when It was
thought he had a rare chance to win, but
to-day, when his owner and his trainer
thought he was not up to a bruising race
he galloped home with a good bit to
spare, making the other horses look like
selling platers. He was followed In by
the uncertain Bex, while the great mare
Imp finished third.
The great crowd cheered the horses
i enthusiastically as they marched to the
post. Starter Fitzgerald got them In line
at once and they were sent away in per
fect alignment on the llrst break. There
was no delay to affect the top weights,
! so all had an equal chance. Half Time
broke in front, with Ethelbert close be
hind and Box third.
As the horses settled into their stride
Spencer pent Voter to the front, and he
was running - freely in that position as
they went past the first furlong pole. He
had but a head the better of Contestor,
the lightweight, and the much-played
Waring was third. Maher had taken
Ethelbert into the sixth place and was
holding him in good position for the fin
ish. At the quarter pole there was no
change in position. Voter and Contestor
running heads apart a length in front of
the others, which were well bunched be
hind them. As they prepared to round
into the new track Voter began to open
up a gap, and as they rushed around the
turn into the home stretch it looked as
if it would be Voter first and the others
far behind.
Suddenly Maher seemed to wake up on
Etbelbert. and as the flying horses
rounded th^ turn the maroon and scarlet
jacket came flashing around on the out
side and in an instant Ethelbert had
poked his nose in front of the whole band
and was gradually increasing his ad
vantage. It was a prand race for p'x
furlongs and then a procession, with the
crack three-year-old of 1S'j9 leading it.
The Maiden ptorplechase, which con
clude the day's racing, resulted in a
chapter of accidents. Of the nine horses
which started, only three finished, and
the v.-inner. Buela, the hot favorite, was
I hen dfsriu.ilifi<?d. Master Ford refused
and the five others fell. Phillidore broke
his neck. None of the jockeys were
seriously hurt. Results:

Then came the Metropolitan handicap.
A year ago Ethelbert was beaten for the
Perry Belmont stable, with Danny Maher

Morris Park to-day before 20,000 people.
He was favorite In the betting and beat
his field by three lengths. Box taking sec
ond place by a neck, from Imp. The time
was 1:41*4.
There was never a greater crowd at tfir
Metropolitan handicap than to-day. Al
though every one was anxious for the big
race, there was a lot of Interest In the
Juvenile stakes, for two-year-olds, which
brought "the best of the youngsters to
gether. Competitor was the favorite in
this race, but was never prominent. Bel
larce made all the running, but when
they came Into the last furlong Spencer
cut loose with Tommy Atkins and won

What gats at Hank's heart with trip
hammer effect is the fact that Greek
Scholar Steffani was touched seven times,
while Iburs's curves were straightened
for but four hits. Up to the ninth the
game was a tie. The -Dudes, last at bat,
put a quietus on an elongated game, sat
isfying the spectators, but pilling the din
ner ot Uncle Hank.
The first inning passed in rapid order
without a man reaching first, but in the
second, after two men were entombed,
Reilly made the initial bag on Franck'a
error, going to second on Peeples' hit and
crossing the rubber Â»n Krug's hot
grounder to left. lburg went out and
Frisco went to the field.
In the third the Dudes worked the score
board for a stroke. Lange went to first
on a hit, reached the middle station on
Steffani's sacrifice and third on Schmeer's
out. scoring on a passed ball. From this
stage of the game till the end of the
eighth inning neither side succeeded in
forcing a man over the rubber.
Then came the ninth. Schmeer was
sent back to the benches. Hammond,
next at bat, bunted a trifle too hard, but
Brockhoff helped him along by a fumble
and he was safe at first. A steal took him
to second, another to third and he scored
on Peeples 1 muff of Hutchlnson's fly. The
ball belonged to all three men in that vi
cinityâKrug, Reiily and Peeplesâ but the
latter got his mitts on the ball that did
not stick and the game was won by. the
Brummels. The score: Â¦
The tale is a sad one and "Hank" Har
ris is encased in triple mourning robes on
account of his hard luck. After playing
the best kind of ball for eight innings the
mascot, Theophrastus Such, took a spell
of hiccoughs and frightened Brockhoft
into an error that put Hammond in the
running. Hammond scored, breaking the
tie and winning the game for the Dudes.

We can hardly congratulate ourselves
that the danger from pneumonia is like-
ly to be less with the incoming and in-
clement spring than it was in the
months gone by. It goes ttfithout the
saying, ?hen, that we cannot take too
many precautions."
Dr. Humphreys' Specific "Seventv-
( seven" ("77") restores the checked cir-
culation (indicated by a sudden chill),
the first sign of taking cold: starts the
blood coursing though the veins and so
"breaks up" the Cold. Manual of all

"The present fall of temperature over
a large area of country', and the proba-
bility of its continuance for some time,
is very iikcly to affect the public health
by the increase of all such troubles as
commence with the 'ordinary cold.' In
this connection we cannot lose sight of
the fact that grip is still prcvailine. and
although it has been on the wane there
is a threat in the present cold wave of
a revival of the former malignancy of
the scourge.

I was then, as now. traveling for Munyon.
"At Catalina Island I met a Harvard

read character, and when Perew said that
one-third of a mine, the Maxln*. which Is
named after Maxine Elliott, the actress,
could be secured for $500 [ unhesitatingly
gave him $500, although frÂ« was a complete
stranger.
"At that time 1 had never heard of
Searchlight. Soon after lhat I whs In Col
ton nnd there met Charlie Colton, a miner.
I have relatives named Colton, and the
triple coincidence utruek me. By good
lurk Charlie Colton knew all about
Pparchllprht. I asked him, with some
trepidation, whether ho knew Perew. lie
said he did, and that Perew was all right
and that there were rich mines at Search
light. So I went to Searchlight, found
that there was gold In the Maxlne, re
turned Kast and on the train got a min
ing partner. W. K. Hllblsh. who was a
mining superintendent In New Mexico.
"To make the story short, Hllblsh went
to the mine. One day before the two years
had elapsedâ tho period fixed by the clair
voyant for me to acquire wealth â I re
ceived word from Hilbish that the prop
erty was lasily worth $230,000. Perew sold
out. Here arc samples of ore from the
mine." . .

he could hardly stand up. Another was
that Caleb Powers told him on the day
btjfore the assassination that the best
way to kill Goebel would be to start an
argument in the Capitol Hotel and kill
him there. . He t-aid Powers declared
Teylor would pardon the assassin.
At the afternoon session Whftrton Gold
en told apain about Youtsey gettinff the
key to the Secretary of State's office from
Joiin Pcwer.iv. John Powers told him two
negroes had been brought here to kill Goe
bel. On cross-examination Golden said
that Kinley had said that if the contest
were not stopped "CJoc-bel and his gang
v.ould be killed." Onldeh replied. "I am
with you on that." The witness heard the
people around the Stale House say that
Goebel would be killed if the contest was
not stopped. When asked if he was not
testifying because he had been promised
Immunity Gulden said that T. C. Campbell
ha<l said he. would do .ill he could for him.
George K. Hemphill, clerk in Secretary
Powers' office, and also there when
Charles Finley wa? Secretary of State,
followed â¢iolden. He saw Youtsey In the
onic-e on Saturday before the assassina
tion with x rifle. Youtsey came into the
room a minute or two after the shots.
Governor Taylor came into the room and
asked what the trouble was and when told
f-aid. "My God! this Is terrible!"
AYitnepF hÂ»Â»Br<1 Sheriff Burton fnow de
reased> threaten to kill <Â»oebel several
times.
Republican StPto Treasurer Walter R
Day testified that a few days before the
assapp'riation Youtpev left word for the
witness to .ome to his office to see him.
Â¦\Vh*>n he pot thÂ«"ro Youtpey told him he
coiiid settl* the contest for J3O0. Day
asked Youtsey how hÂ» would settle it and
hn declined to say and Day left the room.
On cross-examination Day said he knew
nothing of ai:y conspiracy to kill Gonbel.
The. commonwealth rested Itf cas<? at the
conclusion of Day's testimony. After some
unimportant testimony in rebuttal the de
fense closed and the court recessed until
7 o'clock to hear arguments.
At the concJUFlon of the motion of W.
H. Culton for bail to-night Judge Cantrill
denied the application and the defendant
was remanded. In rendering his decision
the court said In part:
"I could not now indicate what sort of
evidence, broupht out in this case, would
be competent in the final trial, but the
uncontradicted evidence on some of thÂ«
points Jn the. case left the court no re
ciur^fi but to refuse the defendant's ap
plication for ball."
Judge Cantrill Denies the Motion
of the Murder Suspect That
He Be Admitted to
Bail.
"So Drunk He Could Hardly
Stand Up," According
to Culton.

SEATTLE. Wa^h.. May 5.â Amon* the passengers from Latuya Bay to
Junrau or. th^ Bertha, which arrived to-day, were a man named Nelson and
his -wife, who reported to the authorities at Juneau a sensational case of
murder and lynching which occurred at Latuya Bay last November.
According to their Ftory they and txto othersâ white menâ were at din
ner on* day, when Steve Severts, one of the men, arose, walked out and re
turned with a revolver, shot and killed the other white man and wounded
Â¦ the woman, but before he could do further damage was disarmed by Nelson.
The latter ar.d another white man, aided by an Indian, kept Severts a
prisoner for a month, meanwhile trying to communicate with the authorities
at Juneau. Finally, fearing 1 Severts would escape or murder them all, he was
hanged by those r.t Latuya Bay. Nelson and wife then came to Juneau by
the flr^t summer and pave themselves up.

road Brought Out in Last Day's
Proceedings â Decision Prom
ised on Monday.
The hearing of the Fresno rate case
was completed before the Railroad Com
missioners yesterday and was submitted
after brief arguments. The Commission
ers held a short consultation and then an
nounced that they would be ready to give
a written decision on Monday afternoon
at 2 o'clock.
The principal point brought in the evi
dence yesterday vas that while the rail
road company claimed that the $3 75 rate
had been made as an experiment and had
been withdrawn, presumably because it
was not successful, the records of the
Auditor's ofllce show that the road more
than doubled Its business to Fresno dur
ing the time the 53 75 rate was in force.
Attorney Short figured out that during
the last three months of 1896 the com
pany sold, under the J5 90 rate, 1103 tickets
for the total sum of $6519 60, while for the
last three months of 1S09. when the $3 75
rate was In force, the total sale of tickets
amounted to 40S6. bringing in $15,322.
Attorney Short also offered in evidence
a circular letter issued to Southern Pa
cific apents In the San Joaquin on May 4,
1S97. by General Passenger Agent Good
man calling attention to the new form of
tickets, with the admonition that "by
placing: these tickets in your hands you
are put on an even keel with the agents
of the Valley road," and briefly summing
up all of the Instructions in these words:
"In short, we expect you to send almost
your entire business via tne all-rail line,
simply ticketing via the- steamer route
when you are unable to otherwise con
trol it."
During the morning session Assistant
General Passenger Agent Horsburgh was
on the witness stand for a time. He de
clared that, so far as he knew, there was
no traffic agreement between the South
ern Pacitlc and the Santa Fe Company.
Testimony In regard to the sale of tick
ets was given by Edward E. Holton,
ticket auditor of the Southern Pacific
Company. ,
Judge A. P. Van Duzer made the open
ing argument for the plaintiff and was
followed by Attorney Foulds of the rail
road company, who tried to convince the
Commissioners that the words "excur
sion" and "commutation" mean some
thing entirely different from the generally
accepted meaning when applied to rail
road tickets. lie insisted the whole cast
hung on that one point.
The closing argument, made by Attor
ney Short, was able and convincing and
seemed to carry conviction with It. He
declared that it was a matter of such
common knowledge that the Southern Pa
cific Company had put down Its rates to
compete with the Valley road that it
seemed like child's play to try to prove
it to Intelligent men. Horsburgh had let
the cat out of the- bag when he said to
Mr. Moss of the Valley road, "If we make
our rate any higher you'll get the travel
and we will be out in the cold." The
closing sentence of the circular letter of
May 5, Issued by Mr. Goodman, when he
spoke of "controlling" the valley busi
ness, was another convincing bit of evi
dence that the competition was keen.
Attorney Short declared that the people
were prepared to fight the matter in the
courts If neces5ary. -They feel that they
have right on their side and that the rail
road company has openly violated the
plain law to their injury and they are
bound to get Justice. There was no ani
mosity In the matter, he said, but only a
desire to see the 1 law upheld.

The United States training ship Adams
arrived In port yesterday with the- first
division of apprentices on board. She left
here on January 13 and went to San
Diego, thence to Magdalena Bay, where
the boys had target practice: back to San
Diego, thence to Santa Monica, Santa
Barbara, Monterey and Santa Cruz and
back to San Francisco. The Adams did
not anchor in the bay, but went direct to
Mare Island. After a stay of about ten
days at the navy yard she will start out
again, going north to Port Los Angeles
and other P-uget Sound ports. On June 11
she will leave Victoria. B. C, for Port
land and Astoria, and after a stav of a
fortnight In the Columbia River she will
get back to San Francisco In time for the
Fourth of July.
The Italian bark Precursore that arrived
here on March 4 from Genoa is in a peck
of trouble, and Captain Schiaftino does
not know when he and his vessel will get
away. There seems to be no money with
which to pay the ship's bills, and in the
meantime the Precursore lies In the
stream with a hungry crew and an empty
larder. After discharging her cargo the
Precursore was chartered to load redwood
lumber for England. She was loaded and
ready to sail on April 26. and ever since
Captain Schiafflno has been trying to
straighten out the monetary tangle into
which his ship has got. Yesterday it be
gan to look as though the libeling of the
vessel would end the trouble, but the aid
of the courts has not yet been Invoked.
In the meantime the crew is making a lot
of trouble and insists upon getting some
thing to eat or else its discharge and pay.
Trouble on the Precursore.
When last pay day came around the
crews of the Manning, AlcCulloch, Me-
Arthur and Rush.maae a demand for an
Increase of pay, which was of course re
fused. The men then decided to bide their
time and quit in a body. Saturday the Man
ning came alongside Green-street wharf
to coal, and as soon as she was tied jp
the men gathered their belongings and
walked ashore.' Sailors are very scarce on
the beach, as almost every vessel on the
coast has been put into the Nome trade
and good men to man them are at a pre
mium The captains of the revenue cut
ters and coast survey steamers will have
considerable trouble in getting new crews
even if the Secretary of the Treasury
does permit the advance in wages.
In the meantime quite a fleet of poach
ers Is heading for Bering Sea, and should
the revenue cutters be delayed two or
three weeks quite a catch of seals can be
made without fear of interruption.
There Is trouble brewing throughout the
entire revenue cutter service, and unless
Uncle Sam agrees to pay the regulation
wage now in force on the coast he will
have a very small fleet of vessels In Ber
ing Sea and the Arctic Ocean this season.
Sailors on the revenue cutters are getting
$5 a month less than the men on the
coasters. The crew of the Bear refused
to go to sea at the old wage, and wnen
their demand for an advance was refused
they walked out in a body. Then the mat
ter was referred to the Secretary of the
Treasury at Washington, and after a
fortnight's delay Captain Tuttle received
permission to pay the ruling rate of
wages. After a great deal of trouble he
secured a new crew and the Bear started
for the Arctic. after a delay of nearly
three weeks.
The sailors on the United States revenue
cutter Manning quit the ship In a body

released on bonds, and when the case was
called in the Superior Court he did not
appear for arraignment. Judge Dunne
ordered his bonds forfeited and a bench
warrant was Issued. Baxter had no Idea
of trying to escape trial, but as he was
not represented by counsel he did not un
derstand that he was to appear for ar
raignment, but held himself In readiness
for trial. When he found that he was
wanted he Immediately went to police
headquarters and sought to break into
jail, but as "the only fellow in the depart
ment that knew anything about his case
was out of town he was cast out of prison
into the street. He became so anxious in
his desire to break into jail that he finally
went in search of Judge Dunne. Finding
that Judge Dunne was out of town with
the Native Sons he telephoned to his
Honor, but could not locate him. Then
he settled down In despair.
After Judge Dunne returned to the city
Baxter made known his peculiar predica
ment and yesterday an Investigation be
gan. Detective Balnbridge was called
from downstairs and immediately ascend
ed the witness stand. He explained to the
court that the original arresting officer
was out of town; would be back Monday,
and then the arrest would be made.
"\re there not a few detectives in the
city to look up cases "If the fellow who
knows about the case' happens to be
away?" said Judge Dunne to Bainbridge.
"Is it habitual with the police to Join the
name of n certain officer with that of a
certain criminal and then make all others
keep hands off? This condition certainly
astounds the court, but In view of the un
paralleled prayer of the police we will all
patiently await the arrival of the officer
vesÂ«ed Tilth original Jurisdiction in the
case. TliÂ«Â»n perhaps Baxter may break
Ir.to custody that the charge against him
may be heard."
Thus fled the hope of Baxter, and he
mu&t await the coming of Monday and
the fellow with the knowledge. Meanwhile
he Is under bonds.

v tAutKS or tue Bryan wing of Cal- i
Ifornia Democrats assembled at the
j| a California Hotel yesterday fore
noon and wrangled. After a long
discussion it was resolved, in effect, that
the Democratic County Committee of San
Francisco, headed by Jasper McDonald
and bossed by Gavin McNab should not
be deprived of the privilege of appointing
delegates to the local corwention to be j
called for the purpose of choosing dele- |
gates to the State convention.
The fayir.g that politics makes strange !
bed-fellows was aptly illustrated at the i
wrangle. Gavin McNab, reinforced by
twenty-five or thirty proxies, was sus
tained by Governor Budd, who had a
small bouquet of them, &vA by Charles
W. Fay, who was permitted to speak for
Quite a number of absent members.
I. Dockweiler and W. R. Burke, repre
senting elements of the bitter factional
fight In Los Ar.geles, were present, each
armed with powers of attorney to repre
sent seme, other fellows. The feuds of the
Democratic State Convention of |8M were
revived. The exchange of Insinuation was
carried to the danger limit of personali
ties. Reference was made by Burke to
the railroad collar on the neck of the
Dockweiler faction. This allusion made
Dockweiler so hot In the collar that spec
tators fancied he was ready to spring at
the throat of his antagonist. It will be
called to mind by those familiar with the
proceedings of the Democratic State Con
vention at Sacra.mer.to In IMS that Dock
weiler lost the honor of presiding by rea-
Bon of the presentation of proof that ad
vocates of his cause traveled from Los
Angeles to Sacramento on tickets freely
issued by the Southern Pacific Company.
Later on W. It. Burke, who directed the
Dockwcller opposition, became a candi
date for the State Beard of Equalization
and was knifed to the finish by Dockweil
er and the agents of Herrin.
In the light of the established fact that
William J. Bryan traveled in California
en passes issued by the Southern Pacific,
the indignation of lesser statesmen of the
Democratic party who are charged with
wearing the railroad collar can hardly be
accounted for. When The Call produced-'
the positive- proof that Bryan accepted
passes. W, H, Mills justified the girt of
transportation on the ground that Bryan
was a good ican. a member of an aris
tocratic church and the friend of corpora
tions.
The wranglers at the California resolved
that the State convention should meet 'at
Sacramento on June 34. A big convention
of HK) delegates was decided upon. Each
county is to have sÂ± delegate, end also ad
ditional representation of one delegate for
each 2 1 *) votes cast for Bryan In 1SS5, and
one delegate for each majority fraction of i
200 votes.
J. J. Dwyer, Democratic national com
miueeman and administrator of the.polit
ical estate of Thomas Jefferson, attended
the wrangle yesterday and used his gifts
of eloquent persuasion to induce thr com
mittee to give the common, every-day
Democrats of San Francisco the right to
express a choice in the selection of dele
gates to the convention. Max Popper,
with less eloquence, but with feTeat sin
cerity and commendable tenacity, fought
Bide by side witri Mr. Dwyer. M. F. Tar
pey also fought for the principles of
Thomas Jefferson. He had faith In the I
rank and file of the party. The fight for
the people was hopeless. McNab. Budd
and Fay held too many proxies. McNab
pimply s-mlled at the futile efforts of the !
Dwyers and the Poppers to break his cen- j
ter or turn either the Budd or Fay flank.
Norton of Orange, bearing the proxy of I
the gallant Edelman, went to the aid of
Popper. He proclaimed against the sys
tem of appointing delegates.
Ex-Governor Budd's opposition to any
direction in favor of primaries had the
merits of consistency. He asked the
chairman to read the constitution of the
State Central Committee, and Mr. Mann
read: "No delegates shall be elected ex
cept at primaries or county conventions."
The alert ex-Governor then maintained
that the committee had no authority to
direct any method of electing delegates.
He cited a Supreme Court decision to sus
tain his contention.
By repeated inquiry Max Popper ascer
tained from Seth Mann that the latter In
tending out official notices would recog
nize the Jasper McDonald committee as
the Democratic County Committee of San
I Francisco. Mr. Popper also succeeded in
: eliciting the all-important Information
I thai Chairman Mann would not direct the
j County Committee to hold primaries for
I the election of delegates to the county
; convention.
The technicalities were brushed aside
i when this admission was made Some one
exclaimed: "The committee will appoint
' itself to the convention. It is all the
, same. You shut out the voters."
The Jeffersonians fancied that h. great
ipclr.t had been gained by the revelation.
â¢ J"ho Dwyers. Tarpcys. Nortons and Pop
pers smiled in expectation of triumph, but
Â¦ tre McXabs, Dudds and Fays knew the
j in-pramme and knew that they had a
I proxy power sufficient to execute it.
: \\ hen the roll call was complete it was
i found that only nine members stood for
th<j principles of Thomas Jefferson. On
; the other side sixty-seven were arrayed,
i Among those who voted against giving the
I Democratic voters of the city the right
; to bo heard in the councils of the party
, were: Gavin McNab. James H. Budd.
James D. Phelan. Charles W. Fay, of
I ban Francisco; Senator LaRue of Napa.
! Senator Prisk of Nevada and W. R, Burke
i of Los Ar.gÂ»les.
L Whenever the name of William J. Bryan
j wns mentioned the committeemen ap
i plauded. Ex-Governor Budd gained a
, round of applause by predicting that Ad
; rnJral ' Dewey would be nominated for
j \ ice President on the ticket with Bryan,
j The ex-Governor fancied that Dewey
t would be pleased to preside over the de
j liberations of the United States Senate, as
lessons leayscd there would fit him for
Â¦ hiÂ£hf r station later on.
i ThJ members to the number of about
fifty assembled In the corridors of the
â¢ California Hotel before 10 o'clock, the
j time set for meeting, and cooled their
I heels until Chairman Seth Mann and the
j officers or the committee could Ret the
j gearing lunning smoothly. A half hour
I later the members were Invited to walk
; up and secure their seats, as the ball was
! about to be opened. A few score of Dem
ocrats, with half as many proxies, en
1 tered the room and awaited develop
! ments. Attorney M. C. Hassett. opened
I proceedings by moving that all those
holding proxies have the right to pjarti
clpate in the business of the meeting
The motion prevailed. When Secretary
McCabe called the roll it showed that Mc-
Nab and Fay could easily control the
deliberations of the body.
Max Popper bobbed up at the conclu
sion of the rollcall and asked the chair
man to read the provision <of the consti
tution, which provided for dues and as
sessments. He Insinuated that some of
the gentlemen present had been lax- in
their payments. Mr. Mann read the fol
lowing excerpt: "Each member of the
committee (except the- chairman, secre
tary and treasurer), unless excused by the
committee, shall pay to the treasurer
within thirty days after his election .the
sum of ?20. Failure on the part of any
member to pay this amount after due
notice shall work a forfeiture of member- j
ship." Mr. Dwyer said that there :Â» werc'i

about twenty who had not paid the as
sessment, and each would demand a trial
and the committee at this time had no
opportunity to Investigate the matter.
Mr. Popper brought the matter squarely
before the members by moving that those
who had failed to pay the amount be ex
pelled. Dwyer quickly moved to lay the
matter on the table, but again he was
foiled by Popper, who asserted that a mo
tion of that kind could not prevail until
the original motion was put. The motion
was then repeated by the chairman.
Governor Budd said that he did not know
who the delinquents were and moved that
they be tried seriatim. Delegate Dwyer
reiterated his motion to lay on table and
it prevailed by a vote of 18 to 14.
Secretary McCabe read a number of
communications. The first was from the
Iroquois Club and was in the form of a
resolution. It read as follows: "San
Francisco, April 20, 1900. Resolved, That it

tion that will select delegates to the Na

Another was from the committee on
conventions of Sacramento inviting the
Democrats to hold their deliberations at
the Capitol. The communication was
signed by Mayor Clark, A. C. Hinkson
and Talbot H. Wells.
M. F. Tarpey moved thabthe committee
proceed to name a time and place for
holding the State convention. Before the
motion was placed before the body W.
H. Devlin of Sacramento moved that the
first convention for the election of dele
gates to the National Convention be
held at the city of Sacramento at a date
to be fixed > later. Mr. Tarpey. retired for
the moment and the chairman- put the
second motion, which was unanimously
adopted.
Mr. Tarpey moved that the convention
convene Thursday. June 14, at 10 a. m.
Senator J. H. Seawell, who was given
voice In the deliberations by virtue of the
proxy of J. C. Ruddock of Ukiah, deliv
ered a long speech in which he said he
wanted to consult with the members of
the best of selecting candidates. He said
the sole purpose of holding such a con
vention was for the purpose of electing or
selecting eighteen men who are to nom
inate W. J. Bryan.
"In eo far as the First Congressional
District Is concerned." he said. "I think
we can agree among ourselves who will
go from that district. I am aware that
the selection of- delegates by committees
who have not been directed under the law
to make such selection Is a dangerous
party precedent. We are willing that San
Francisco. Los Angeles: and Sacramento
hold a convention, but so far as we are
concerned we would much prefer to make
the selection of the First Congressional
District and I believe the members of that
district would like to make that selection."
The' chairman then ' out Mr. Tarpey's
motion and it was carried.
W. R. Burke of. Los Angeles suggested
that the next question to be taken up was
the one of apportionment. Chairman Mann I
stated that one had been figured out on
the basis of one delegate at large from
each county and one delegate from each
three hundred votes cast for James G
Maguire in ISaS and one delegate from
each majority- fraction of three hundred
which gives a total of four hundred in the
convention. Mr. Burke moved that the
basis of apportionment be the vote cast
for. the highest elector for William J
Bryan in 1S36â one delegate at large 'Â¦â¢ for
each county, : one delegate :< for each two
hundred â¢ votes and one delegate for Â¦ each
majority * fraction - of one hundred. l';< The
motion , brought on.a ! lengthy discussion
Fiery speeches were delivered by Tarpey
Before adjourning Chairman Mann
called attention to an indebtedness of $2000
which stood against .the committee.: and
asked for relief. Mr. Tarpey aided him In
his efforts, and their combined appeal wao
so touching that Mayor Phelan. who was
present, subscribed $1000 toward reducing
the debt. â¢ Governor Budd added $100 M
F. Tarpey $50, R. M. Fitzgerald $50. W. H*
Alford $50. J. C. Bonner $50. Ed McCabe
$25. Charles H. Holcomb $20. J. X. Gal

Resolved, That we earnestly appeal to Con
gress to enact before its adjournment the nec

Chinese exclusion law. Including Japanese anj
Asiatic laborers of all sorts, whether disguised
as merchants or otherwise.

which will be especially disastrous to the labor

Resolved, That the Democratic party does not
hesitate to declare its earnest and heartfelt de
sire that the Boers may be as successful In
their struggles as the Americans were when
fighting for the same principles and aeainst
the same enemy.
Clltus Barbour Introduced the following
resolution, which was also adopted: .
â¢ The provision was read by the chairman.
It is as follows: "The State convention
to nominate State officers or delegates
to the national convention shall be called
by the State Central Committee by notifi
cation to the chairman and secretary of
each county committee at least ten days
before the time fixed for said convention
and said call shall explicitly state the
time and place, the business to be per
formed and the basis of representation
Said call shall be signed by the chairman
and secretary of the committee. Should
there be any neglect on the part of the
county or district committee to call any
of the conventions for which the State
Central Committee has issued calls the
State Central Committee may call such
convention directly.. No delegate to such
convention shall be elected except at pri
maries or county conventions."
Chairman Mann decided that this law
provided for the calling of a State con
vention and defined the duties of the State
convention in that respect and therefore
the State committee could not do anything
except what was provided for by this sec
tion, namely, to call the convention to
designate the time and place and to fix
the apportionment of delegates He ac
cordingly sustained the point of order and
stated to the committee that if it desired
to prescribe primaries and to provide for
the election of delegates to the State con
ventions or to the county conventions an
appeal might be taken from his decision
and the committee could then proceed to
act as It saw fit. Mr. Dwyer took the ap
peal and was backed by Max Popper and
Mr. Norton. A vote was taken and the
chair was sustained by 67 ayes to 9 noes'
Senator Seawell offered the following
resolution, which was adopted- uuuwin5
Whereas The liberty-loving people of two
little republics of South Africa are now en

against the aggression of a powerful monarchy
desirous of extending its Imperial domain" and
Whereas. The Republican administration,
abandoning all the traditions of the founders
of our republic and ignoring the almost unani
mous sentiment of the American people has
continuously shown that its sympathies are
with the monarchy, therefore be it
Resolved. That the Democratic party should
place Itself on record as being: in sincere sym
pathy with the brave citizens of the Boer re
publics of South Africa and as condemning
unqualifiedly, the attitude of President Mc-
Kinley b administration in its un-American
sympathy with Great Britain in the war now
bein* ruthlessly waged by that country
against freedom and republican institutions
and be It further
Then followed a wrangle over primaries
which lasted for nearly two hours. Â¦ It
arose over a motion made by R. H. Nor
ton of Orange County that delegates to
the county conventions should be elected
at primaries, or if no county conventions
were held delegates to the. State conven
tions should be elected at primaries. Gov
ernor Budd made the point of order that
the constitution and by-laws of the State
Central Committee adopted at the last
State convention defined the powers and
duties of the State Central Committee in
this respect.
C. C. Wright offered an amendment
which had for its object the holding of a
smaller convention.. The amendment was
lost by 70 noes against 16 ayes and the
original motion made by Burke prevailed
unanimously.

short time.
Mrs. Moore made a statement to Cap
tain Seymour last night, in which she ad
mitted her relations with Brown. She said
the latter had on numerous occasions
chased Getz away from her residence.
While Barry Getz. suspected by the po
lice of having robbed and shot Frederick
J. Bortzmeyer and also of the robbery of
Hedburg, was locked in a cell at the City
Prison yesterday morning another excit
ing holdup took place in the Â¦western part
of the city, this robbery, occurring just
when the police thought they had landed
the man wno was profiting from the scare
Policeman Brown denies that he was in
timate with the Moore woman. He ad
mits that his beat was on Ellis street, but
he paid no more attention to her than he
would to any one else on his route. He
thinks that in Getz they have the right
man.
It Is openly charged that Getz and
Brown were suitors for the favor of Mrs.
Margaret Moore, and that the former out
bid his policeman rival for the affections
of the woman. It is alleged that Brown
swore to be revenged. It is even asserted
that he visited the saloon of Getz's broth
er land warned him to keep, his brother
away from the vicinity of Ellis and Larkin
streets, as he might be arrested. The
prisoner was either not warned, or if he
was took no heed of it.
There are some developments in. the ca3e
of the accused which would appear to give
color to the contention of his relatives
that the whole affair is a plot to rail
road him to prison. As usual, a woman is
the central figure in the plot. The alleged
villain is said to be Policeman George
Brown.
Despite the protestations of Getz's in
nocence witnesses are cropping up who
are certain that he was the man who way
land and robbed them. Albert Ziegenbein,
a sailor, positively identified Getz yester
day as one of two men who robbed him
on Howard street near Beale. The sailor
picked Getz out of a crowd of prisoners.
fr-iiâ JHE relatives of Barry Getz, the sus
pected footpad, are positive In their
II assertion that the young man is the
victim. of spite work. They state
they will prove beyond a shadow of a
doubt that he is innocent of the crime
charged to him. They even go so far as to
charge that Policeman George Brown,
whose beat is on Ellis street, is the per
son who is trying to undo Getz. Jealousy
is given as the cause of the ofllcer's al
leged scheme.
Folio-wing are the hold-ups

Numerous complaints having been
made to the Southern police station of a

where women were found at the bar last

As a result the officers arrested fifteen

perate Â¦; habits and Â¦ a â¢; husband's , forsaken
hope â¢ of | bringing j about a Â¦ reformation \ In
the'interestrofUheirlittle children. ~
Lestrange employed an attorney, who
was about to bring proceedings for a dis
ruption of the marital ties. This fright
ened the wife and she promised to reform.
Her husband agreedito give her one more
chance and there was three weeks of sun
shine in the Lestrange household. Yes
terday-morning; the husband attended a
funeral. When he came home he found
his wife drunk and the children Â¦neglected.
A portion of a can of beer remained on a
table In the room. -
Seizing his wife by the throat Lestrange
exclaimed, "Alice, I will kill you if you
do no stop drinking!" . Â¦:-Â¦Â¦Â¦
He quickly released her and left the
room. In a few moments his little son
rushed to him and told him that his
mother hadjumped from the window. He
found his wife on the pavement, three
stories below. She had thrown up the
window, clutched the sill Â¦Â¦ and dropped.
Her body struck the roof of a small shed
which protrudes from the building at the
first story and splintered it. :
'The woman made the statement that
her husband threatened to. draw a knife
and that to escape him she tookthe dan
gerous leap. Theichildren, both of whom
were; witnesses to the quarrel, say that
no â¢ knife Â¦ was mentioned and agree ' with
their father's -story. â¢ _Â¦Â¦ : :

Jarty! and placed In the tanks, pending an
investigation. : Mrs.' Lestrange Is 32 years
of age. vr73EBfaaBWWWMBBMBBMBlBgÂ«bM<WiBWi
According to the husband of the woman,
Mrs. Lestrange commenced to drink some
time ago. Her condition at times was
helpless and pitiable and his home went
to pieces. .His children's morals became
corrupted by rapid strides. He threatened
divorce, .with the custody of the two
children, a boy aged 10 years and a girl of
8. For a time this called a halt In the
woman's disgraceful life. She took a
pledge two months ago, but it was quickly
broken. Three weeks, ago she again be
came intoxicated.
"I escorted a young lady from Fischer's
music hall to her home on Mission street
and started for my own home at 11:40
p. m. I walked up Market and Ellis
streets. The lights went out when ;i
reached Leavenworth street and it be
came very dark. As I passed a hedge
about seventy feet from Larkin street I
saw a man leaning against the gate and
evidently hiding between the square ends
of the hedge. I looked at him closely as
I went by. It was 12:15 o'clock when I
got home."
Stenhouse looked at Getz and said be
believed he was the man he saw hiding in
the hedge gateway.
Zlegenbein says he told the story of hla
being held up to the proprietor of the
New California House, to his friend. John
Ryan, who lives at the Reno House, and
to an East street policeman. Officer Mc-
Grath. as it was subsequently learned.
All, these people substantiate Zlegenbein's
statement. Ryan says the sailor told him
also of seeing the footpads at the Olym
pia and seemed very angry that they, got
away.
Zlegenbein has not worked for nearly
a month. He was last employed on the
coasting schooner Santa Cruz, and says
he is going to Alaska soon for the Alaska
Exploration Company. He to now living
at the Reno House.
Getz was liberated last evening, hi3
brother and brother-in-law furnishing
bonds for his appearance. His case will
come up Monday morning at 10 o'clock Be
fore Judge Mogan.
Ziegenbein says the reason he Is so posi
tive in 5 identifying Getz is that the al
leged footpad was smiling all the time he
is stated to have aimed the pistol at the
sailor's head.: and that he smiled the same
way at the Olyrnpia.
The crimes committed by the daring
highwaymen are gradually coming to
light. Thera was still another victim
yesterday morning. After, the footpad
hail relieved James Rlley. the veteran sol-
Lorenzo Stenhouse Jr. of 723 Ellis street.
who thinks he saw Getz hiding In a hedge
gateway, said:
"Two nights afterward I was at the
Olympia concert â¢ hall," continued the
sailor. "Two men sat at the same table
with me and were talking of Alaska.
Finally one of them said 'If I had shot
him that night he wouldn't be sitting; here
now. He knows us. too/ With this I
looked at the men and saw they were the
same two who had held me up. It was
Getz who pointed the pistol at me.
"I determined at iirst to grab Getz. but
having no knife or pistol decided not to.
While I was .thinking the matter over
the pair got up and went in behind the
stage. I ran out to the side entrance and
watched for them to come out, but- they
did not. I told a policeman all about it.
Before issuing, the warrant for Getz's
arrest Judge Mogan questioned Zlegen
bein, but the sailor stuck to his story.
Bail was fixed at $3000.
Then came the most Interesting part of
Zlegenbein's story â that relating to his
alleged meeting with his assailants at a
concert hall. . . .â¢
" 'What do you want?' I asked of the
men, and one- of them said something 1
did not understand.- I asked them again
what they wanted and the one who had
spoken before said they wanted money.
I ran away and j they got nothing from
me." . '
Zlegenbein related the following story
while the complaint he was waiting to
swear to was being prepared:
"I had been to a theater with a friend
named John Ryan the night I was held
up and was returning to the New Califor
nia House on East street, opposite the
Government dock, when the footpads
stopped me. Ryan, who lived at the Reno
House, left me and I went on down to the
front alone. Between Third v and East
street the sidewalk is - very bad, so I
stepped out into the middle. of the street.
Down by Beale street two men came out
from behind some old machinery and one
of them leveled a pistol at me. resting it
on his left arm. and ordered me to stop.
Getz looked like a man on the verge of
delirium tremens when he was brought
from his cell early yesterday afternoon
in response, to a request: for an interview.
His gaze wandered everywhere save on
the eyes of his questioner. He trembled,
looked wild" and gave every Indication of
having passed a most uncomfortable
night.
"I won't say anything more. I don't
want to talk," he exclaimed agitatedly
when a question was asked him.
"Sit down and don't be afraid.", said the
questioner. "No one's going to hurt you."
Getz sat down, but when another query
was put to him he sprang to his feet, ex
claiming:
"I don't want to talk. Sure, I don't. I've
said all I'm going to.", and he asked to be
taken back to his cell.
To make - -matters | worse for the
trembling, terror-stricken Getz, a young
man called on Captain Seymour after the
complaint had been sworn to by Zlegen
bein and said that a little while before
the robbery of iJortzmeyer occurred he
saw an individual answering Getz's de
scription hiding within the gateway of a
hedge on Ellis 'street, ; near-Larktn. He
said he believed Getz to be the man be
saw. "Â¦"..Â¦ Â¦â¢-â,. ' Â¦ Â¦ - ' '-'â¢Â¦Â¦ r

created by the imbecile Vetsera. set the
officers hard at work again. Even should
Getz prove to be a footpad It is evident
to the police that the genus did not be
come extinct in this city by his capture.
Along came a sailor man yesterday aft
ernoon who swore that on Monday night,
April 23, Getz and another man held him
up on Howard street, near the water
front. This sailor, Albert Ziegenbein by
name, positively identified Getz, picking
him from among three other prisoners,
and then swore to a complaint charging
him with assault with intent to commit
robbery- Zlegenbein's narrative Included
the tale of a meeting with Getz afterward
at a music hall and the sudden departure
of the alleged robber fromthat place upon
his spying his alleged victim. The sallor'3
identification of Getz and the minute de
tail of his story caused the detectives to
place credence in what he said.

The question debated was:
"Resolved. That the guarantees of the

They will be in better condition and will

We had a chance to-day to repay Yale
for her clean sportsmanship. In both the.
100-yard and 220-yard dashes tho Yale men
were' not able to hold 'their marks artd
stepped over the line. This if punishable
by pettinp these men back a yard, and is
always done here in the East; but' both
Captain Drum and Cadogan allowed the
men to start on the same mark with them.
This act wjis appreciated very much by
the Yale men. In the 100-yard dash Cado
gan won handily, with Drum only third.
In the 220-yard race Cadopan led by two
yards until he grot within twenty yafdÂ« of
the finish. In the 440 yards Drum was
iirnien r.xil by two yards in the final
sprint. In the fcSO-ynrd and mile run both
Service and Moser were clearly out
classed. In the 120-yard hurdle? Hamlin led
by a little over a yard and would have
won easily had he not hit the last hurdle-.
Tho 220-yard hurdle would have been a
closer race had not Woolsey lost his step
after tho pcrond hurdle. Tho hurdles were
mrrc fences stretched acnÂ»ss the track,
statement that if we had two weeks to
train on this track we could beat Yale,
but the opinion of most of the boys is
that we could only tie her. Yale has thÂ«

Rood that she is groins to send it to Paris
to compete fcr the world's championship.

Judge Cabanlss yesterday, with obtain
ing money by false pretenses. He was
accused of getting $11 from Joseph Boldt ;
saloon-keeper at 25 Eddy street, by show-
Ing a bogus bankbook with the Germania
Savings Bank with $350 to his credit. The
bankbook was produced, and It showed
that the $350 was on the debit side Instead

terday that the contracts entered into by
Â« Vj L1 PP inc Â°tt and the association Â£or
neld work a week ago were satisfactory
and had been fully approved. Professor
Newell will not be able to visit the State
on the 14th. according to Invitation, but
.fc..wood Mead, the Government's expert
in the irrigation line, will be here on that
date and will then probably sign the con
tracts for the Department of Agriculture.
a e mea ntime search will be made
at Sacramento for costly maps made by
the dqfunct State engineer's department.
The maps show the waters of Kern, Tule,
Kaweah and Kings rivers, and they are
said to be correct. If these maps, which
cost a great deal of money, can be found
they will save much labor and time.
The expectation is that the field work
will be actively under way before the
end of the present month. The funds of
the Water and Forest Association are
now over the 510.000 mark. J. D. Spreckels
Bros. & Co. have subscribed $1000.
The receipts will be divided between the
Home for Aged Women and the Central

The Hawaiian band was so popular un
der its canopy of palms that all the after
noon there were throngs to hear the mel
odious music The singers not only
charmed with their voices, but were ap
plauded for their patriotism. For a
poster put up by Mr. Smith announcing
that the canopy had once served aa
Agulnaldo s headquarters was promptly
torn down. Behind the band the observ
atory invited crowds, and visits were
made to Mr. Smith's old mining cabin, -to
"Lilac Cottage" on the hillside, to the
beautiful conservatories, the stables and
the bands stationed at different points in
the park. The deer and rabbits came in
for no little attention, too.
The battle of flowers was held in front
of the main entrance, and was a merry
affair. While It was raging a pony draw
ing a cart in which two little people were
seated became frightened and ran across
the lawn and among some ladles who
were viewing the battle. No harm was
done, and the slight accident was the only
one of the day. The ponies and carts
were an unending source of delight for
the boys and girls, and the donkeys were
greatly enjoyed. The popular turnout of
the afternoon was Walter Morosco Bish
op's four-in-hand of Shetlands.
When the guests began to arrive at 3
o clock they were received by Mrs. Frank
Marion Smith. Miss Marion Smith, Miss

Lovers of rod and gun are greatly in
terested In the coming game protection
convention which Is to be held In this city
May 24, 25 and 26. The purpose of. the
gathering Is to formulate plans governing
the protection of fish -tnd game. The con
vention will be attended by delegates
from all parts of the State. Local dele
gates are already discussing matters to
be brought before the meeting.
It is deemed advisable to have a law
prohibiting the sale of rainbow trout. An
other would prohibit the taking or sale
of Mykiss or cutthroat trout before June
1. In the past the law has permitted the
taking of steelhead salmon with hook and
line In tidewaters at all times. It is con
sidered advisable to protect these fish even
from line fishers in tidewaters after Feb
ruary 1.
Another Important proposition that will
be advocated is the limiting of the num
ber of game birds that a person may take
in one day. Further protection of game
birds, especially water fowls, will take
the shape of a law prohibiting the killing
of game half an hour before sunrise and
half an hour after sunset. Many will ad
vocate the prohibition of netting ducks
and other game. Serious consideration is
being given to what will be a strong move
to shorten the open season on all kinds
of game. Among the other prohibitive
measures will be the sale of grouse and
mountain quail and the killing of pheas
ants at any time. Heretofore snipe, plover
and curlew have had no protection. The
convention will no doubt' advocate giving
these birds the same protection as other
game.
The deer subject will be duly considered
and a plan is suggested for their preser
vation by shortening the open season to
six weeks, giving county Boards of Super
visors the right to fix the period for the
open season. Where such action Is not
taken the general laws of the State as
to dates will prevail. A proposition to
separate the game and fish interests will
be made and the suggestion will follow
that the expenses of a State Game War
den should be borne by the hunters them
selves in the form of a license, which may
also be imposed upon the game dealers

was conscious for several hours, but sank
rapidly, cerebral hemorrhage setting in
and causing death soon after midnight.
Mr. Haar had driven home last evening
from his office, using his own team. He
intended to return downtown and left his
horse tied. The animal freed itself and
strayed off. In the meantime Miss Pest
dorf, a sister-in-law of Haar. had driven
up to the house with a high-spirited horse.
Instead of going after his own team
Haar. when he was ready to depart, bor
rowed his relative's horse and buggy. He
had gone only a few blocks when the rest
less animal suddenly became frightened
and began to rear and tear about the
street. During the fractious animal's
plunging the bit was broken. Freed from
restraint the horse swerved and then
made a sudden turn, which cramped the
forward wheels of the rig so suddenly
that Haar could not save himself as the
buggy upset and threw him Into the street.
He was stunned when assistance reached
him, but regained his senses for a time be
fore his death.
The deceased was a contractor and
highly respected In the community, hav
ing been a leader In the development of
Haywarda. He was 4<5 years old and a na
tive of Germany. He settled in the town
manv years ago. His wife and three
small children purvivo him. He was an
Odd Fellow and a member of the For
esters of America.

One cf the features of the Knights Tem
plar Conclave In Los Angeles recently was
the exhibition drill by (iolden Gate Com
mandery's Drill Corps of this city. That
this famous corps, which is commanded
by Colonel William Edwards and R. B.
Moore and John Dennett as senior and
junior wardens respectively, maintained
us well earned reputation is in evidence
from the following report by one of the
local papers: "The Knights wore black
capes lined with white, the corner of the
right side thrown back, adding effect to
the uniform. They came on the floor in a
Quick step and the applause was dcafen
inÂ£ It was the first corps to essay a
double quick step, an innovation appreci
ated by the audience. The alignment was>
perfect, while the section and company
Iront movements were also perfect, a.
bugler in army uniform sounded the as
sembly. In response the Sir Knights of
the <<;rps from aJl parts of the hall rallied
la double quick time. In an instant the :
command was given, every man assuming :
his proper plact with a precision that won
the admiration of all. This presaged the
drill that has made the corps famous, and
It sustained its hard earned reputation.
After going through the many intricate
movements cf its predecessors the corps
gave a sword drill, v.hich elicited the un
bounded applause of the onlookers. The
exceptionally rapid step put vim Into
every movement; stars, crosses and dia
monds were worked out from columns of
three so rapidly that the spectators could
hardly keep track of the changes. Foi
rapidity of movement, correctness of evo
lution and unity of action nothing; supe
rior has been seen In this city in many
years. Colonel William Edwards, tho
commandant, knew his men and they
knew him. His orders were given with
the confidence that they would be obeyed
in the minutest detail, and they were. It
was a drill that did the spectators good,
end the applause was loud and long as the
corps marched to the space in front of
the prand commander to give the final
ealute."
California Commanderv No. 1 of this
c!ty also made a very creditable showing
in the city of LÂ«os Ar.geles.4The command
cry in its beautiful and rich uniforms
mounted on black horses, following Com
mander John Tonnlngsen. who was .
mounted on a white charger, was one of ,
the very attractive features of the grand
procession. California Commandery al- !
ways makes a f.ne showing on parade,
and on that occasion it was up to its
usual standard.

London Market.
NEW YORK. May 5.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial j cablegram says:
The market here was becalmed to-day, but was
firm on the news of Lord Roberts' advance.
Funds are hardening again. Americans were
quietly hard. There was some inquiry for Bal
timore and Ohio Und Louisville and -Nashville
on the expectation of a good bank statement
in New York. Copper shares wero firm on
Paris inquiry. The bank received Â£15.000 gold
from Australia and lost Â£30.0C0 to the Cape,
fall mmey was easier and bills rather weaker.
The bank did a small business In discounts and
was repaid t?mall loar.s due. Silver was sup
ported on Indian demand.

There is warrant for the assertion that the
banks did not gain as much from the interior
last week as the figures Indicate ami that they
actually lost to the treasury on gold exports.
The specie already forwarded . on this move
ment amounts to $3,200,000 and while In a de
cline In reserve may operate to check the out
ward flow, there seems to be no reason why In
terest rates should advance. A factor In the
money market oftfn overlooked In this connec
tion Is the ability of the trust companies to
loan at minimum rate*. The Comptroller In his
call for official statements last week asked for
a specification o f trust companies and savings
banks deposits In national banks. It Is known
that these institutions are carrying at least
$50,000,000 in national banks. The State banks
also report heavy trust company deposits. The
loans and deposits of the banks at the present
time are one hundred mljllon dollars In excess
of the averages at the opening of the year,
while reserves are only four millions higher.
Continued receipts from the interior are looked
for for some. time.
The rising deposit total called for $4,273,000 In
creased reserve, so that the effect of the Inte
rior receipts was neutralised and I1.005.SOO was
taken from previous accumulations, bringing
the present excess to $15,37$,4<o.
NEW YORK, May 5. â The Financier says: The
New York Banks' statement for the week end-
Ing May 5 Is surprising In several details. To
begin with, no local cause can be assigned for
the expasnskm of J13.221.400 In loans and the
'corresponding Increase of J17.000.000 In deposits,
although it Is said that at least five millions a*
the loan increase was brought about through
technical operations attending the completion
of the consolidation of two large banking
houses. The eight millions or over still unac
counted for Is larger than the events of the
week seem to have called for, but with money
easier here than at any point in the world, It Is
not unlikely that the banks are taking advan
tage of an opportunity to increase profits by ex
tending the scope of their operations abroad, a
course that has been resorted to before under
similar conditions. This Is the theoretical view.
As a matter of fact a detailed analysis show*
that the loan increase has been scattered
through a large number of banks. The gain
of over seventeen millions on deposits (s due to
the loan expansion and receipts of three.mil
lions In cash from the Interior.

considerable credence, but the working agree
ment with the N'Pw York Central is believed to
be involved In the deal. The story of a steam
ship service to run from the Long Island
toast was revived in connection with the
mnvpmÂ« > nt in the stock. The reports ot the
mercantile agencies served to confirm the im
rrcFslon of the reactionary course of prices of
commodities and of trade activity. The cur
rent stagnation in Wall street is the logical
outcome of there conditions. Buyers- are out
of the market, fcut holders of securities are
not yet sure that the current reaction Is not
making for the ultimate health of business.
It is perceived that the recent hiph level of
prices was Kuch as not only to unduly stimu
late production, but also to decrease the con
sumptive demand. Securities are obviously be
ing firmly held under the probable level of
prices and the volume of consumption shall
adjust Itself to afford a basis for estimating
future returns. The Ftock market has plvrn
evidence during the week of having reached
an adjustment to the new conditions presented
l>y the unexpected developments In the Iron and
6tApi trade of three we*ks ago. The llqutda
tion indued by that development overran Itself
as the Invariable rule with speculative move
ments and the br-ars last week had to bid
up prices to sot back stocks which had been
sold short. This week the market has been
without the sustaining force of the demand
from the oversold lifars and the vibration of
prices has b?i*n diminished. The professional
traders in stocks in whose hands operations
have been largely Ipft have met with little
sucesa In moving prices. TIip declines from
their short selling hare brought on very little
stock, and the prices attracted no following
to take stocks off their hands. Buyers want
more light on the future course of business
before taking on stocks. One large cauw of
perplexity over the outlook Is the present iargÂ»
reflux of currency to New York bank reserves
from the Interior. The gold export movement,
now fairly Inaugurated, is a re?ult of this.
Ordinarily the exportation of gold has an un
favorable effect on the stock market on 1 ac
count of the apprehension aroused that tight
ness of money may result. In the present in
stance that effect Is due to the feeling that
the plethoric condition of the money market
is a register of declining Interior trade and
reduced needs for money owing to the de
creased business. The recent developments In
the steel trade give special point to this ap
prehension. That the country's business is not
finding full employment for all the money in
the country is evident from the action of the
money market, but the increase In the money
supply seems to be taken Insufficiently Into
account. . According to the monthly statement
of the United States treasury the total amount
of money In circulation in the country. In
clusive of caFh In the treasury, the amount
on May 1, ISM. showed an increase for the
month April of $39,270,951. and for the
twelve months previous of JI26.057.571.
The bond market has been dull and has
moved tn sympathy with stocks.

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
CHICAGO, May 8.â Wheat opened firm under
support from higher Liverpool and Paris cables.'
Trade Was quiet throughout the session. Until
the prospect for next season's campaign be- I
comes somewhat more clearly denned In the
market' it Is thought not likely to become gen
eral. K Following the opening there was a brief
period â¢ of easiness because of the reports of
favorable weather and no further additions to
the < stories of damaR* by chinch I bugs. This
was recovered, however, on the Improved cash
demand and the close was steady. Predictions
were made that the Government report ex
pected Thursday will rals* the April condition
above the present 'figure, 81.1 per cent. July
closed a shade down at 67%c. * /
Corn was firm at about* yesterday!* closlne
quotations mo3t of the session and business
was : principally of a local character. Busi
ness was firm and country .oCTerlnKs reported
lighter. July closed a- shade. reduced.
Oa's were .quiet- but firm. The May- July
spread was narrowed to Â»Â»c. July closed He up.
Provisions were dull and heavy. There was
soiling -by packers and foreigners, ; and Â¦ while
there was some buying on the break the de
mand generally was scattered and slow. The
hoÂ«r market was weak, and this Â¦ also had a
depressing effect. .Tulft pork closed 20Â®22Â»tc

Receipts of Cherries continue light and the
commission merchants say that reports from
all districts indicate only half a crop. In fact,
j the outlook for all fruits is nowhere near as
good as It wa3 a month ago, and nobody expects
a very heavy crop now. It is a good thing in
one way, for a moderate year Is more profit
able than an excessively heavy one.

DID IDT SETTLE
TIE MATTER OF
SPECIFICATIONS
Howard-Street Dock Scandal
Gingerly Taken Up by
Harbor Board.
Luinber Men File an Evasive Beply
and Engineer Holmes Allowed
to Report on Cylinder
The Board of Harbor Commissioners
held a meeting yesterday afternoon for
the purpose of going into the scandal con
nected with the construction of Howard
street dock Xo. 3. The newspapers were
not notified that the meeting- wai to be
held, neither were the contractors, who
were ready to afSrm that they bid, sup
posing ship planks, as called for in the
specilications, were to be used in making
the cylinders iriFU-ad of the second-class
material the City Street Improvement
Company is using.
If yesterday's action constitutes all the
board is going to do in the matter, it cer
tainly has fallen far short of its duty.
The committee of lumbermen appointed
to determine whether or not the lumber
used In the cylinders was s=uch as the
specifications called for did not determine
that point at all. They were careful to
fl!e a report that did not touch on that.
They simply filed a document stating that
the lumber used was grood enough for the
purpose. That report is as follows:
SAX FRAXCISCSO, May 4, 1500.
To thc Board of State Harbor Commissionersâ
Gentlemen: Complying with your request to
inspect the cylinders prepared for Howard
â¢street .Nc. 2 and the lumber used In their con
struction and to report to you our opinion of
the material. Â«e, the. undersigned, have to-day
examined the finished cylinders now in position
under the wharf, as well as thoee lying on the
wharf and the unfinished ones in course of
construction. We have also carefully inspected
the lumber beinj â¢ put Into the work and find it
sound and Â«tror-s. of eood merchantable quklity
and entirely euitable for the purpose to which
it has been and is now being applied. Very
respectfully yours, RODXEV KEXDRICK.
JOHX DOLBERR,
R. L. TAYLOR.
The board complacently allowed How-
JhU^th ? Ime8l i Jta^ chief en eineer, to
throw the following document at it:
~ ._ â FAN FRANCISCO. May 5. 1S0O
To the Honorable, the Hoard of State Harbor
CommlMlonere-GÂ«ntleniÂ«: On stripping the
top of pier Xo 10 ( Howard-street wharf N O . j)
I found that the surface of the mud aÂ« It ex
Uted disagreed with data on file In mv office
from which the length of the wooden cylinders
were determined, end on driving the first row
according to the length specified on plan they
were found to be too lon*r to drive without
Injury. I had some shorter ones made and
Instructed the ln B peÂ«or to have the balanc
of euch lenrth Â«o as to have the b&me depth
In the mud, which was about nineteen feet
end to keep a record of the lengths actually
dr.ven for reference on completion of the con
tract,
_The result was a difference In the length of
4.. Jeet between the cylinders actually driven
which *u 134. and those Bpeclfled.
I recommend that your honorable board
make a deduction from the contract at the
rate of II 60 per lineal foot for each cylinder
reduced, -which would be 477 lineal feet at
Jl â¬0. amounting to J7C2 20. Â»Â»Â«" "*t. at
I also recommend that the board dredire the
south- side of the wharf before the cylinders
are driven, aÂ« it is almost impossible to drive
the lengths specified as the mud is very com
pact in. this locality for the reason of the
varlcup vc-Fsels lying Jn the mud at low water."
HOWARD C. HOLMES. Chief Engineer.
Mr.' Holmes, as' will be noticed, did not
state in his communication how manv
pore fept of Fhortage there would have
been had not The Call opportunely made
an.exposure^ot how he was allowing the
contracting firm to build short cylinders
nor how much those cylinders would cost
per foot had they - been constructed of
Fhlp planks, as called for bv the specifi-
Suf.b^irsÂ° nternpIated blv *Â»e "nsuc
â¢ President kllbura spoke of the matter
THE market for realty has not devel
oped many large sales during the
week. Agents say .there are. large
deals In view but that the news is
not ready to give out, as they are not
closed. The largest price received for any
single piece of realty in the city during
the week was for a 50-vara, sold by T. LÂ».
Lyons to R. S. Moore of San Francisco
for $60,000. The location is the southeast
corner of Steuart and Folsom streets. The
brokers were.ShainwaJd, Buckbee & Co.
A fact that will not be lost sight of In
considering the prospective values of real
ty In San Francisco is the actual advent
of the Santa Fe Railroad.
G. H. Umbsen & Co. and Thomas Ma
gee & Sons have Issued their monthly
publications for May. Naturally much of
the space is devoted to reviews of the
transactions in realty during the month
of April. The Real Estate Record, pub
lished by Umbsen & Co., says that in San
Francisco last month 297 deeds were placed
on record and the total value of property
transferred was $1,311,S1L The Record
says :
"It Is clear from the records of April's
transactions that the demand is chiefiy
for the best classes of retail business and
residence properties. The former Is stead
ily extending in territory to the north and
] west of Market street until now Taylor
i and Jones streets occupy relatively the
positions of Stockton and Powell streets
a few years ago. At the same time the
permanency of this growth is attested by
the nature of the buildings going up in
the district in question. The San Francis
co real estate market Is conser%-atlvc, but
It is a conservatism of healthy progress.
There could be no better condition for
the future." s : '. r
Loans for April amounted to $9i>5.C54 and
repayments amounted to $1,041,200. For
four months of the current year the loans
and repayments have been as follows:
Loans, $6,672,313; repayments, $6,460,053
The Rear Estate Circular says:
"There is one point in real estate not
hitherto pointed out, and that is that there
is more Inquiry at present for large lots
for hqme manufactories â in some cases for
lease, but in more for purchaseâ than at
any time that we can remember in the
history of the city. We can hardly con
ceive of a more satisfactory state of af
fairs. All of these Inquiries come from
factories already In existence and. doing
such a good business that they are seek
ing larger quarters, the most of them de
siring to pass from the dependent position
of lessees to the independent one of buyers
and owners of large parcels of land for
their own use. There Is increased inquiry
for land between Buchanan. Devisad^ro.
Vallejo and Union streets. That region
has fine views of the bay and has the
great merit of r.ot being so windy as Pa
cific avenue and Broadway. The total
number of sales made In April was 324, of
the value of $1,245,815."
All signs point to future active move
ments in real estate In Berkeley. The
great amount of building that will be nec
essary for the construction of the uni
versity Â¦will undoubtedly enforce the resi
dence of hundreds of families from the
outside while the buildings are under way.
Hundreds of workmen will permanently
settle there.
Burnham & Marsh will hold an auction
sale of realty at their office, 20 Montgom
ery street. May 10 at noon. Among the

One of the largest contracts to sell

cific Rolling Mills to the Risdon Iron and
Locomotive "Works, twelve blocks, with
personal property, for 5550,000.
Some of the more important builders'
contracts of the week are the following:
Hale Bros, with Campbell & Pettus for
interior finishing for store building near
Sixth street, on Market, $11,240; contracts
by the D. Ghirardelll Company with vari
ous parties for building a two-story frame
and basement brick warehouse on the
north line of North Point street, east of
Polk; a four-story brick building will' be
erected on the west side of Dupont street.
Just south of Jackson, at a cost of $9900.
A residence to cost about $12,000 will be
built for Charles Bush on the north side
of Eddy street, 25:6 feet east of Franklin,
for which some of the contracts have been
awarded. >
Kitty-live mortgages were filed during
the week, aggregating $1S3,S5O. The re
leases were forty-three and the amount
was $117,461, The larger loans of the week
were as follows: $40,000 by the Hibernia
Savings and Loan Society on the'50-vara

Jones, to Abraham Aronson at G per cent*
J25.0OO by the Hibernia Savings and Loan
Society on the northeast corner of Sutter

ma Merritt at 6 per cent. The releases in
cluded the southwest corner of Merchant
and Montgomery streets by the Security
Savings Bank to Antoinette N. and J.
Xaglee Burk. on which $30,000 had been
loaned; all of Outside Lands block 205 by
C. B. Currier, executor. of the estate of
Emily F. Currier, to George M. Mitchell

land by the Hibernia Savings and Loan
Society to Annie Boland, the total being
$22,000. b
Ed Ewald. chairman of the executive
committee of the Nineteenth-avenue
Boulevard Club, has submitted a report
concerning the result of a petition sent
to the Park Commissioners for an en
trance into Golden Gate Park at Nine
teenth avenue. He says:
"The estimate of the cost of the work
according to the plans and specifications
was $1000. At the instance of Hon A B
Spreckels, the president of the Park Com
mission, and Hon. Reuben H. Lloyd, one
of the Park Commissioners, the club was
required to raise only $300 toward this
amount, which is very reasonable, since
up to this time all the entrances on the
north and south sides of Golden Gate
Park have been dedicated by corpora
tions or private Individuals."
Mr. Ewald has been authorized by the
club to raise the money needed. Contri
butions may be left with Edward Ewald
or to his order or to the order of John
McLaren, superintendent of Golden Gate
Park, or with Charles Pope, 11 Montgom
ery street, i
Sol Getz of the well known real estate
firm of Sol Getz & Bro.. after thirty-three
years of active business career. in Cali
fornia has Just left the city with his wife
for an extended trip through the Eastern
States.
In the construction of the new Hayward
building at the northeast corner of Cali
fornia and Montgomery streets It will be
necessary to do some preliminary work
that will seem a little odd to the casual
observer. It has been ascertained that
the building adjoining the Hayward site
at the north Is over on the Hayward prop
erty some Inches. Instead of making the
owners of the Infringing structure tear it
down a process of chipping or "shaving"
down the walls of the building- will be
adopted. This has been done before on
other buildings in the city. Of course the
owner of the building over the line will
have the cost to pay. Â¦ As the Hayward
building will be close against its northern
neighbor the older building will- not be
weakened in the slightest.
THE closing night of the fourth an
nuEl exhibition of the San Francisco
Kennel Club, at Mechanics' Pavilion
last eight, was a brilliant affair.
Fashionably attired women and their es
corts moved, up and down the aisles ad
miring the winners and comforting the
losers. There was a continual press about
Dr._H._I* Tevis* bull terrier Lady Venom,
which "carried off the principal honorsâ
that of being the best of the breed in the
T. K. James' Banjo Best Lightweight Bull-Terrier in the Show.

Then the â¢ company â¢ pretended - to . show
fig-ht. W. E. Dennlson, Its secretary, said
of the engineer allowing contractors to
deviate from the specifications, andjeave
Mr. Holmes, to. understand that in .future
no deviations, no matter how' small,
should be allowed .without consent of the
board. The president; notified the City
Street Improvement Company representa
tives who -were present, having evidently
been notified of the meeting, that the
amount due ' f or ' â¢ shortage of cylinders
would be taken from the final payments
made them.
The Coroner's Inquest yesterday Into the
cause of the death of Sergeant Robert
Wilson failed to throw much light upon
the affair. Two facts stand out promi
nently, however, as against the theory of
suicide and in favor of that of murder.
The first is that there were no powder
marks on the person or clothing of the
dead soldier. The second is that neither
of the two; revolvers in the case was
found until the next morning, in spite
of the thorough search made by the
police, the Coroner's deputies and the
neighbors on the night of the killing. J.
Prince, a neighbor, searched for two
hours with a lantern within a radius of
lifty feet from the body, but was unable
to discover any weapon whatever, yet the
Colt's army revolver was found the next
morning by Policeman Morris In the grass
fifteen. feet, from the spot where the body
had lain and in a direction where it could
never have been thrown by Wilson after
the bullet passed through his heart. â¢ â¢
The unloaded revolver belonging to Mrs.
Caeassa was picked up on Wednesday
morning near tthe middle of Lake street
by James Keating as he was going to his
work. This , was the weapon, that John
Kesseck. the drunken 13- year-old boy,
took out of, Casassa's house and had in
his hip, pocket when he and. the little Cu
neo boy went out with Ida Ferrari and
Soldier. Wilson.
-According to 'the testimony of Deputy
Coroner Charles Meehan, Ida Ferrari was
drunk when he arrived on the scene of the
shooting. The boy Kesseck was lying on
his face, helplessly, drunk, on the floor of
the Casassa house. â¢ .
W. F. - Miller of 1819 Lake street heard
his dogs bark at a quarter of 9 o'clock on
Tuesday'> night, and also heard' two -boys
go. .past his house. \ He 'looked out and
i saw aiwoman running after them. When

to the effect that It was Improbable that
the wounds could have been Inflicted by
Field himself. The bullet wound did not
have the appearance of having been made
at ctose quarters. The fracture of the
skull on the right hand side might have
been caused by the counter-shock of the
bullet wound. The powder marks on the
back of the right hand could not bÂ« ex

man the winner was put through his paces
by Joe Kerr. He climbed a ladder, jumped
rope, picked money out of a pall of water
and found a piece of money hidden In the
sawdust. He was easily adjudged the
winner. The prize for trick dogs under
twenty pounds was won by Emil Mark

sold at auction under adverse conditions,
the remainder of the dogs making music
which drowned out the auctioneer's voice.
Charles Newman's St. Bernard Golden
