Is plain EngTttb for the matter.
For the last three years Kong Tue Wei
ihzs been making startling announcements
through the acrobatic columns of The Re
former. These announcements have
reached the Chinese of the world and have
loJd them that the editor had seen the
Emperor. "He has told me to tell his peo
ple that he is being subjected to many
hardships. 11* is locked fast in a prison
cell and is fed i<}< 6 a dog. He Is allowed
no speech with men, and he begs rae to
speak fcr him to his peopleâ to ask them
to organize a Eoclety of reform and to
protect him from further ill treatment at
the hands of thp Dowager Empress."
So, In substance, runs the statement,
eften reiterated, cf the radical editor.
While lie has been writing to this fashion
!the Fore-ipn Office at Peking has been
stating arA proving that Kuong Sul is In
the capital city, living the free and easy
life of a royal younj? man of 33, having
everything he wants In life except that
tempting throne.
But Kong Yue Wei. the editor, has done
much by means of his tales. He has es
tablished his society in Macao. Hongkong,
Tokohama, Nagasaki , Honolulu, Victoria;
B. C; Portland. Los Angeles and San
Francisco. In these cities, where great
cumbers of the young Emperor's people
ere to be found, has the magazine been
circulated, and the people have subscribed
and much money has poured Into the*
shrewd editor's pockets. Up to the pres
ent date between $7,000,000 and $8,000,000 has
been ttowed away in tho various banks at
Enasrh&l, Hongkone ar J Macao.

f :s pitting an American finger In the Ce

Mr. Lea Is about to pack his steamer
trunk for Hongkong. Once inside China
he Â«xpectÂ» to become <*ommaTi<ier In chief
of the revolutionary forces and to have
10,003 men. turned over to him to be drilled.
He will teach them how to make war
upon things as they are. In the name of
the dethroned Emperor, Huong Sul, they
Â¦will, co rues the plan, overthrow the
Dowager Empress, who rules.
Home: Lea Is a Stanford student these
days, a yourg man of more or less leisure,
who comes to town of a Friday night and
makes pleasant headquarters at one of
our iweH hotels. With the assistance of
Dr. E. H. Samuels. L. E. Taggart, John

T HROUGH the courtesy of The Call certain letters and
jf papers of a most incriminating character and great im
portance to my Government have been placed in my
hands â documents which prove beyond the question of a doubt
that a young American citizen has been plotting with the leaders
among the Chinese revolutionists and hopes to become the com
mander in chief of the insurrectionists in China. The nezvs comes
to me as a shock, but I must compliment The Call upon the com
pleteness ofMiis expose and the careful manner in which every
thread of the plot has been 'drawn together, weaving a net inzvhich
I find all of the conspirators fairly caught. The Chinese plotters,
both here and in China, have all been placed under the most
watchful surveillance, but ive hardly thought that we should be
troubled by ambitious Americans desirous of self-aggrandize
ment and grasping for riches stained with the blood of misguid
ed rebels; it now seems that we must be prepared for even this.
It is unfortunate that an American should submit to be made
the tool of these insurrectionists, under the guise of reforming
China, but we have taken precautions against things of this
character, and if ever attempted these people will find themselves
well met at every step.

among these cities.
The lieutenant left China early in the
year, and since that time he has been.
traveling through the Orient. At Hono
lulu his associates were the- most desper
ate- Chinese characters of the Hawaiian
Islands. These people banded together
more firmly -with his aid, and, as leader,
he petitioned the Government for per
mission to Incorporate the Bow "Wongr
Wuey, a reform society. The cunning of
his race twinkled in the eye of Leong Kel
Chew, for, said he to himself, now we
shall be under the protection of the Ha
waiian Government. But the Chines*
Consul at Honolulu protested vigorously.
''This so-called reform society is nothing
more nor less than an association of high
bindera," he announced. Then, while thÂ«
authorities talked pros and cons and d&7
liberated with due slowness, the Consul
brought forth a portion of the by-laws of
the society and read to them as follows:
"If any one do harm to one of our
brothers we must retaliate the same."
Then the Consul took pains to notify his
Government in his next official report or
all the doings which he had been investi
gating. Thereupon the Dowager Empress
v.axed very wroth and demanded the head
of the rash lieutenant. Sixty-five thou
sand dollars she would pay for that same
?ru!lty head, dead or alive. After she bad
issued this proclamation she was so
pleased with the sound of it that she sent
forth another. One hundred thousand
dollars this time for the head of Kong

an old carved pew taken from the church
in Stratford, where Shakespeare lies
buried." Each is numbered and when all
are sold the names and numbers will be
engraved in a book that will be recorded
in Boston and guarded like the Pilgrim
records are.
The purchasers of the settles and chairs
have been institutions, such as colleges
and libraries, in a large measure. The
first purchaser, however, was Mrs. Roger
Wolcott wife of the Governor of Massa
chusetts. Then Bishop McVicar of Rhode
Island bought one and following came
Vassar College, the Boston Museum of
Art and a list of others. -Now, all are
gone but nine, and though there are East
ern people eager to buy. Miss Steams will
probably let Westerners have them.
In California the first purchase to be
discussed and then negotiated was that
of the committee of live from the Ebell
Society of Oakland, which hus in charge
the children's room. These ladlesâ Mrs.
Roland P. Gleason. Mrs. Frederick B.
Ginn. Mrs. John Russ. Dr. Myra Knox
and Dr. Anette Buckelâ secured the two
pieces for the beautiful children s room
that is being planned and that will form
an important part of the building made
possible through .Mr. Carnegie's gift to the
Oakland library.
the new (loor. The rector saw his oppor
tunity. â¢ The pews were banished to an
attic after being sold 'to :in Englishman
for a tons, and prledieu chairs took their
place to the rector's infinite delight. The
news of their banishment reached the
ears of Miss Frances Steams of the Bos
ton Gift Shop, and she conceived the idea
of dropping over to England quietly, of
buying: the pews herself and of having
them made up into their present shape for
American buyers.
Miss Steams carried out her idea, and
so promptly that on arriving one evening
in .Stratford she did not wait for morning
to sec the old pews or to make her bar
gain, but viewed them with a lantern and
closed then find there what the English
press called a "smart Yankee deal." That
was two years ago, and English admirers
of things Shakespearean ate still mourn
ing.
Miss Stearnsdlrected the making of the
settles and chairs. They stnnd fifty-three
inches high, their backs formed of the
old pew doors that bear the Stratford
arms, leopard's heads on a shield sur
rounded by the Prince of Wales' plume.
The old Corporation pew, in which all the
Mayors of Stratford have sat, is un
touched and is the largest and most desir
able piece of all. The history of each is
written on the backs in burned letters,
or his birthr>lacf as indirectly as did the
pews of thu. village church.
The church where they did duty so long
is a medieval structure with a tall spire
that mirrors its top in the stream beyond
the Intervening turf and molde.rlng slabs.
Within its walls, ranged before the chan
cel, they stood carved in Gothic style,
their curious and beautiful doors swing
ing to thousands of worshipers. Before
them, on the north side of the chancel,
was the burial place, whose slab boars
some lines penned by the genius beneath.
Above and in their -view wnn Gerard John
son's bust of Shakespeare that looked out
upon them. Just within the altar rails
stood in plain sight the font from which
he v.a^ christened. And guarded by the
verger was the register wherein was made
the entry of that baptismâ and the entry,
too. of the death.
But after all their usefulness and in
spite of their associations and their unim
paired condition, the pews were taken
one day from the old church and a small
notice was put up advertising them for
sale. . .
The rector who is at present in charge
of the parish is a high church man and he
had long desired priedleu chairs to re
place the heavy Gothic pews. So when a
new floor was imperative it was necessary
to take out the pews in order to put in
mansions (hat are bemoaning their care
lessness in letting the pews slip from
their hands into an American's â the IC3
that have been made will be treasured, to
go down to coming generations a3 almost
priceless heirlooms.
The story of the pew 3, reaching, as it
does, away back Into the years and then
forward to the exemplification of Ameri
can keenness, is a readable one. Xot so
much, however, for British eyes as for
those whose joy is in seeing good things
reach this side of the Atlantic. And as
Bret Harte said, "the reasons is plain."
The story begins and ends with bhake-
For it is he who has made War
vv-k-k. Stratford, the Avon and the stately
Church of the Holy Trinity world-famous
to the end of things and his memory sanc
tifies every stone in the great pile that ia
his mausoleum and every bit of ivy on Its
walls.
But the story of the pews begins in dim
ness. For by whom and where they were
made Is not known. They were placed In
Trinity almost before the world realized
how great the greatest dramatist was and,
though Shakespeare reaped, as few great
men have, fame and fortune before his
death, he was too near then to lend much
Bentiment to anything that concerned him

great friends, and on January 26 he came
to the hospital and proposed that we go
inside the Insurgent lines and visit Ma
lolos. the capital of the Filipino republic.
We decided to represent ourselves as Eng
lishmen, for the Filipino hatred of Ameri
cans had already grown to serious pro
portions. 'The next morning, at 8 o'clock,
Sonnichsen called for me and dressed In
ordinary clothing, we took the 9 o'clock
train out of Manila. At the first station
out we were stopped by the guard, but
we said that we were English sailors, and
were allowed to proceed. When we got
to Meycauayan, the third station out, a
Filipino officer, who was on the train, or
dered the guard at the station to put us
under arrest. The camera that wÂ« car
ried aroused his suspicions.
We were taken before the coman
dante of the town. He was a fierce little
man and when we came Into his pres
ence he had a table In front of him on
which were epread out a rifle? a revolver,
a bolo, a sword and several knives. He
was very angry and picking up the rlfla
he aimed It at Bonnicbsen's head and
snapped It. Zt was a very startling rt-
and were allowed to sleep In a chair that
night, and the next day were thrown Into
a dirty, dark cell with the worst kind .of
Filipino prisoners. We kept up our .bluff
and wanted to see Aguinaldo to tell him
our troubles, but we got mighty little sat
isfaction In that direction. Then we want
ed to ccc the English Consul; and one day
an American was brought to our cell, and
we thought at first that It was the Con
sul. It only proved to be the man who
afterward betrayed us. He was a civilian
and got on the train at Manila while
drunk and woke up at Malolos. We were
kept in the cell for several days, and then
two more prisoners came In, Bruce and
Honeyman, two members of the Nevada
cavalry. We all kept trying to see some
official, but only once did we see the Sec
retary of War, and he laughed- at our
story and with a sarcastic smile asked us
if we were taking pictures "for amuse
ment."
We kept hoping that we could get away
until Sunday, February 6, our second Sun
day away from Manila. We heard the
big guns of the warships booming, and
then we knew that hostilities had begun
and that our cases were hopeless. It was
4 o'clock in the afternoon when a wound
ed general was brought in from the front,
and the rabble In the streets wÂ«nt wild.
They wanted to kill us In revenge.
The excitement subsided after a few
lays and wi found that tht advanc* of
I WAS a prisoner with the Filipino
army for nearly a year and during
that tlxne was dragged the length of
the Ular.d of Luzon and was finally
left to die or live as fate might de
trc-e In the mountain fastnesses of North
irn Luzon, where r.ever white man had
ieen before and into which the Spanish
of those islands had never pen-
Itrated. During all that time I heard not
t word directly from my American corn
fades, much less from my parents In Oak
land, nr.d the only scraps of information
|hat I could glean about the movements
Â»f the American army or from the Ameri
can si<ie were but fragments from iriendly
Epar.lards and a few friendly Filipinosâ
and I did find a fewâ and from the Ameri
can prisoners as they were brought In
In ones and twos and very email squads.
I lost just a year out of my life, and 1
find that I am a little behind the times
In worne things, but I am now trying to
catch up.
Sometimes I wonder how our little band
cf prisoners etood the last few months of
march over the mountains of Luzon,
without shoes, and almost without cloth-
Ing, polng for days at a time without food
bzi-i living U2on a handful cX rice and a
him stay to breakfast. O'Brien did not
want to stay but had to, and while he
was eating his breakfast word came to
arrest him and send him back to Malolos.
The Jails got too fullin Malolos and on
March 8 we were removed to Santa Isa
bel, a few miles away. There we were
lodged In a big convent. On March 12, in
the evening, Honeyman came to me and
told me to put on my shoes. He and
Bruce were out in the big room showing
the guards an American Indian war dance
from the Nevada plains. Then we showed
them how to waltz, and they showed us
come Filipino- dances. That was done so
that we would be permitted to stay up.
I looked around for Bruce, and found he
had disappeared. Â¦ So had Honeyman and
O'Brien. The guards were scattered and
asleep, and I went back to. tell Sonnlch
sen, and to drop over, the balcony -and
make our escape. Just then the civilian,
who had warned the guard of our other
epoipe. came in with the guard. He had
peen the others get away, and warned
the guard again, we had our hands tied
be,hlnd us and then we were tied together.
Bruce, Honeyman and O'Brien were re
captured the next day. They got lost In
the thickets and walked around in a circle
until they saw a flash in the air and
knew it was a searchlight from one of
the ships In the harbor. They, were cap
tured near Bocave, eight miles away, and
would have been killed had It not been
for O'Brien's pass. They were brought
prisoner. Bishop had been on outjwwrt
duty and was captured In that way. He
brought us the first real news of the ad
vance of the Americans. He told us how
they had lain In the trenches for six
weeks, but were now on the move and
coming very rapidly.
Shortly after Bishop arrived the guards'
began to tell us that they had captured a
gunboat and that 150 prisoners were com
ing. We had heard too many stories of
that kind, and we bet the sergeant a bot
tle of vino, or native whisky, that they
would not come. They did not come and
the next day we made the same bet. That
night Lieutenant Gillmore and his party,
numbering eight, arrived. We got the
bottle of vino, but instead of giving It to
the guard we gave it' to the sailors, who
needed it pretty badly. That made our
party fifteen men.
On May 3 things began to get warm for
the rebels and we prepared for another
move. Before we started I wrote the
names of the entire party on the walls of
the prison with a piece of charcoal. I had
done it at Malolos, and this time I added
the names of Gillmore and his party. I
have since learned that we were traced by
those names.
- On May 3 began a long march from San
Isidro to Vigan. We were taken through
mountains and around the Llngayan Gulf
to keep . away from the sea. That was
done because the operations of General
Wheaton made It too warm for them on
were sent to Join us. That made our p*x
ty twenty-seven In all.
During the latter part of the timÂ» thÂ«
civilian who had betrayed U3 several
times tried to do better. He gave English
lessons to a number of members of the
Fillpiro army and Government and made
a few dollars a month that way, with.
which he helped our party. He madÂ»
himself quite popular with the sailors
who had not been with us when ha be
trayed us. Â«
We were three months at BangTiet, and
then Colonel Hare and Lieutenant Howzs
started to tind us. They traced our party
by the names that we wrote on the walls
of everi prison we were in, and they
traced the other party because a man by
the name of Langford who represented a
brewing company painted the name of his
beer on every rock and wall ho coulti
find. They followed -us to Vigan, and
when the Oregon took that placÂ« they
had no trouble in learning that we had
been taken to Banguot. and the beer signs
showed them where the other party wa3.
The beer signs were painted on the rocks
after we tell Eanguet. and did much to
show where we went through tho wilder
ness.
On December 15 we began to move again,
and were taken out of Banquet in charge
of a Filipino lieutenant and a squad of
men. We marched right up Into thÂ»
mountains, and had to beg rice from na
tive huta. and finally had to kill our pack
animals. AYe crossed the river that ran
through the canyon we were traversing
fully ISO times, bark and forth. The Fili
pinos made the natives carry their goods
and quite a lot of money. They had a
powder mill at Vigan. and they tried to
carry the machinery away in pieces, but
dirt not cet mu<h away.
The march was very hard. Lieutenant
Gillmore was not very well, and we were
In a country that was evidently strange to
the Filipino soldiers. We were all nearly
naked, and no ono had any shoÂ»s. WÂ«
had got used to that kind of traveling, but
the Gillinore party had a very hard time.
At last tlie rice gave out, and then th*Â»
Filipino lieutenant said that he would
have to abandon us and that he would
rather do that than shoot us as he had
beers ordered to do. He refused to give us
any arms, but we managed to steal two
boles and some native axes, and we deter
mirrd to build rafts to float down thÂ«
river.
We found the natives friendly, but thÂ»y
did not want us around their villages.
They wanted clothing, and agreed to build
us a raft for every shirt or coat we gave
them. We. hail nonf> too much clothing ai
It was, but we managed to spare seven,
shirts and coats and got seven rafts built.
We found that was not enough, and w<Â»
were just going to so up to the village and
try and get them built when we saw thÂ«
American soldiers coming ovgr the hill.
I happened to be with a man by thÂ»
TijÂ».me of Sackett when they came over th*
hill, and I ran right Into the arms of
Colonel Hare, who was in the lead.
"Are you all here?" was the first th'nr
he said.
"Yes," I replied.
"la Lieutenant Olllmore here?" hÂ«
asked.
I told him h<Â» was, and he said:
"Thank God."
They Vere going to attack the native
village, but we stopped them, as they had
bean our friends, am! then we got thirty
five rafts built and began our trip down
the river. It Is a wonder that some of us
were not lost, tor the raft:? were cap
sized and men were spilled Intn tho water,
but only one man died from sickness.
We reached Abuni? on January 1 and atÂ»
New Year's dinner from hardtack, bacon
and coffee. It seemed a banquet to us.
Christmas dinner had been eaten on ths
way down, the river. We made our way
to Aparrl, and then our troubles werÂ«
over. We were on the extreme northern
end of the Island, having traveled nearly
Its entire length. From there we took
transports for Manila and arrived thers
January. 6, after having been In captivity
for nearly a year.
When I arrived In Aparrt I had a pair
of trousers that did not reach to my
knees, the bottoms havtn* been torn away
In the brush. I had a shirt and no sho*s.
Some of the men In the party were worse
off than I.
When I look back over 'that year ofs
captivity It sometimes seems to me aa If
I must have dreamed It all. Then It will
seem as If I had been In captivity for
many years. But I like Manila ana will
probably return there, but not la thÂ«
army.
of the insurgents* Tens the
Stopy of h?s FeapFur E^pe^ence-
the American troops was very slow, and
we decided to make an effort to escape.
We found a defective bar in one of the
windows and dug it out, so that there
was space enough to squeeze through. We
wore going to escape that night when the
civilian went out to get some water and
we saw him talking to the captain of the
guard. In a little while the comandante
came down and shook the bar, and put us
in another cell. The civilian would not
stay with us that night for fear we might
do him injury.
Â»\e used to get copies of the paper pub
lished at Malolos and read the war news
in that. They used to take the names of
the American generals and" regiments out
of the Manila papers and run the names
as having been killed and captured.
We got used to those stories after a
while, and on February 27 another pris
oner was brought in. John W. O'Brien,
an English prospector, who got Inside of
the lines and couldn't get out. lie had
some influence with a Spaniard who was
serving in the Filipino army and got a
pass from him. The pass was intended
to read to give him "the freedom of the
town." but it was made to read "his free
corn." He discovered that and deter
mined to make his escape. We all gave
him messages and letters and he started
out. He got as far as Polo, and there tha
comandante congratulated him, but made
back and we were all together once more.
Through all of February and March we
were kept either at Malolos or Santa Isa
bel until March 2C, when we again heard
the big guns from the ships and knew
that the army was on the move again.
The sounds kept getting nearer and
nearer and the people began to leave Ma
lolos. The town was almost deserted, the
government had already moved and on
March 27 we were told to get ready to
leave.
About 500 Spanish prisoners were lined
up and put on tho march, and we were
put in charge of a squad of fifteen Fili
pinos. We agreed among ourselves to go
as slow as possible. In the hope that wÂ«
might be overtaken by the American
troops. They were evidently onto our
plan, for they used to punch us alone
with bayonets. We got to San Miguel on
March 31. and on April 2 we reached San
Isiciro. At the former place we had been
without food for some time and were
nearly starved. When we asked for food
the comandante told us to eat air. At
San Isidro we were well treated, but kept
closely locked up.
It was on April 18 that O. O. Bishop of
the Third Artillery was brought In as a
thÂ© coast. It was a march from town to
town. Sometimes we would stay a day
or so, but always getting up and moving
on as the Americans pursued us. We were
with about all that was left of the Fili
pino army under General Tino. He wa*
the hardest ono we had to deal with, and
he ordered us shot several times, but we
always managed to escape. Some of our
hardest times were on this march. Our
clothing was nearly worn out and our
shoes had long since gone. Honeyman'a
feet gave out and one of tae sailors by the
ment, and all that we knew was General
Tino.
During our stay at Vieran we passed th*
Fourth of July. We celebrated It on thrÂ»Â«
bottles of rttio and a br.x of matches. ThÂ«
matches were all the fireworks wÂ« could
get, but we shot those off with a. great
deal of pleasure.
I had rather got used to my captlvitr
and to sudden and unexpected moves. J
had been in custody for the hotter part of
a year, during which tim<Â» I had not heard
a word fmm my parents in Oakland or
anything direct fn.n the Amf-rirar.s ex
cept through the new prisoners who cam*
In. I learned some Spanish and a few
Â¦words of the native tongue, and was mads.
caterer of the mess. Vv c only had what
we could buy with the small allowance
given us, and that was not very regular.
we got some presents from tho natives
and that enabled us to live. Some of thÂ«
new prisoners did not like It. but I hact
â¢een worse times.
On September 5 we started off again,
and I began to wonder where they would
take us next. Some warships appeared,
off Vlgan and we werÂ» all sent to Ban
quet, which was considered the strongest
place In the country. It was only a few
miles from Vigan, but was up In taÂ«
mountains and could only be approached
by one road through a rocky pass, and,
easily fortified. There we were well treat
ed and were allowed somÂ« liberty.
We remained there for three moatlxs.
during which time Vlgan was occupied by
the Americans, and. as we learned lÂ«Ver.
Colonel Huro ami Lieutenant Col\r.el
Kowze were sent them with ths Thirty
third and Thirty-fourth regiments.
On November 29 a party of prisoners wm
brought In. They had been captured at
different times In ones and twos until
there were twelve in the party, and thay.
ception. and I thought for a moment that
we would be killed then and there. I
guess that the rifle was not loaded, for
in a little while he became interested in
our camera and he finally decided to send
us to the colonel in charge. The colonel
in charge kept us over night and the
next day examined us, but he could not
see what we would be doing inside of
the Filipino lines with a camera merely
for amusement. He charged us with be
ing American spies and made out charges
to that effect and detailed a sergeant and
thirteen men to take us to Malolos, the
capital of the republic.
We were walked up the road, not feeling
very comfortable, for we were not quite
sure what would come next. We had no
arms, Sonnlchsen's revolver having been
taken from him. It was after nightfall
when we reached the outskirts of Ma
lolos and then we got the first real scare
of the trip. The sergeant halted his men.
lined them up by the roadside and ordered
them to load their rifles. The place wllere
we stopped was a dark, swampy place
and It began to look as if we were going
to be stood up on the roadside and shot
in cold* blood. We both of us worried a
great leal for a few moments, but then
our march was resumed and we learned
that the loading was done bo that they
would be In order when they arrived.
We were put In a large room In a prison
Httle fruit for a portion of the time. ThÂ«
finest eight that I ever saw In my life
was the little band of American soldiers
as they swept over the hill, cheering and
shouting as they caught up with us after
trailing us through almost impenetrable
mountains and forests for weeks. I think
that every, man in the party cried, and
everybouy shook hands with everybody
else, from Colonel Hor^ down, and you
would have thought that we were all
members of some long-separated family
instead of soldiers and sailors from all
parts of the United States, who had never
met before we went to fight for the flag
on the other side of the world. Every
body cheered and shouted and wept in
spite of the fact that our rescuers were as
badly off as we except that they had arms
and all we had were two bolos and some
rough native axes. I don't ever remember
a finer sight in my life than those 140
men swarming over that hill and yet.
when I look back at the scene now. and
can study it In its detail, I can sec that
they were the most woebegone, wretched
lot of men that could nave been got to
gether. There was not a complete suit
of clothing In the squad and about half
of the men were barefoot or with their
feet wrapped In rags. Some were dressed
only In tneir underdrawers, their trousers
having been torn away in the thickets.
There were only a few coats in the squad
and those were worn by such as had lost
their shirts. I don't think that a man
had a blanket, and some had no hats.
There were only a few haversacks and
canteens, but every man had hung onto
his gun and his ammunition, and every
man was carryiner all the ammunition
that he could. Many of them were sick
from the exposure, but they had to stay
with the main body, for they had cut
loose from their base of supplies ai\d had
to gro on or stay In some native hut with
out assistance.
I went to Manila as a member of the
hospital corps of the regular army, and
sailed from San Francisco on the Scan

THE SUNDAY CALL.
HAB2Y HUBEE, an Oakland
boy, and a member of the hos
pital corps of the regular army, was
the first prisoner captured by the
Filipino nrmy, and vras rescued by
Colonel Hare and Lieutenant Colo
nel Howze after nearly a year's cap
tivity. Being: the first American
prisoner captured in the Philippines
by the insurrectionists he was con
sequently the one held by them the
longest. He was in captivity within
twenty days cf a year, having been
captured on January 27, ISC9, and
was returned to Manila by the United
States trcops en January 7, 1900. He
remained in. Manila until March 6,
when lie sailed for home, arriving in
Oakland last week. Harry is the son
of C. 0. Hubsr, the well known ad
vertising agent of Oakland, and has
countless friends in that city.
The story of the capture and the
experiences of Herry Hubcr is full of
interest. From thÂ« moment that ha
fell Into thÂ« hands cf the Filipino
Frmy. a -week before hostilities broke
out, to the time that his small band
â¢vras joined by Lieutenant Gillmore
and his naval party until they were
rescne d by the gallant party from tho
Thirty-third and Thirty-fourth Vol
unteer Infantry under tho personal
command cf Colonel Hare and Lieu
tenant Colonel Howze, his life -was
full of dangers and excitement. In
the herds of a partly civilized people,
extremely hostile, his life was hardly
caf e a moment. He was dragged from
town to toTm, from prison to prison,
r.s the American army pushed the
rebels back, and drove Aguinaldo
from capital to capital. How he
â¢was dragged the entire length of
the island of Luzon, walking bare
footed, without clothing, going for
days at a time without food, ill
treated by brutal guards, befriend
ed by secret sympathizers with.
the American cause, helped by the
Spaniards, betrayed by one cf ths
members cf his own party when he
tried to escape, threatened with death
many times, left to die in the moun
tains by his Filipino guard, and
finally rescued by the heroic band of
American volunteers that was in
nearly es desperate straits as the
prisoners themselves, makes the most
romantic story that has come from
tbe Philippines and far Luzon.
There â¢were other prisoners cap
tured by Ihe Filipinos in Luzon, but
r:ot many, and nono of them spent
so long" a time in captivity as did
young: Huber, "with the lone exception
of Albert Sonnichssa, his partner,
who is rtiil in Hsiiila.'
There hÂ«we been fragments of
young Huber's story published at dif
ferent tines, but these have been
only a few bar? facts covering a
year cf time, every moment of which
had its excitement. Harry Hub:r has
given The Call the first complete
and connected account of his experi
ences es a captive with the Filipinos.

On June 5 we reached Vigan. which Is/
far up on the northern coast. We found
a very different people here. .They seemed
more friendly to us and did not seem to
like the Tagalos very well. They were
a larger people and finer-looking, and
seemed to be of a superior nature. Senor
Reviera, who had a big vino manufactory
was kind to us, and was ordered shot by
General Tino for helping us. General Tlno
ordered notices posted threatening to
shoot any one who aided us.
We were so far north and In such a sec
tion of the country that we did not know
which way to go. even If we had been ablo
to escape. We had no arms and knew
that we would hav4 to fight our way
ba"ck, and we did not know where the
American troops were. We had come Â»o
far and so fast that we had lost track of
everything.
We were kept three months at Vigan.

plete record of the speeches, debates and

thoie who are sufficiently interested in
the issue to make a careful study of it
can review the whole of the great debate
and draw from it as much information as
Is now available concerning all aspects of
the problem. It is to be noted that none
of the resolutions express the conclusions
cf the conference upon the Issue. That
was agreed upon from the start, for as the
conference represented all shades of opin

for a majority to take upon itself to de
cide the controversy or to declare for
either one side or the other.

"Under the Eagle's Wing."
There is an entertaining etory of the
fortunes of a Jewish lad In the time of

has been bereft of father and fortune by
a French noble, who has tried torture to

pedition to the Holy Land. After his

IHustraticns from
Richard Sudbury's
new book entitled
** Two Gentlemen in
Touraine."
"Two Gentlemen in Touralne."
A smartly groomed book by Richard
Budbury is another instance of the travel
er's temptation unresisted. Mr. Sudbury
confesses as much in his preface. Says
ac: "I had sought enly to bring back for
my oÂ»n gratification an itinerary which
tad afforded me many happy hours.
â¢ â¢ Having teen induced to publish the
papers â¢ â¢ â¢ " et cetera.
They never mean to do it. and they al
ways are induced. But those three hun
dred and odd pages of jogglngs through
France's historical province are- a for
givable transgression after all. They are
not brilliant, but they do not pretend to
te. There is the rcstfulness of eiir.ple dic
tion about them. The author has an In
formal way of introducing one to the peo
ple he meets. Altogether he Is a pleasant
not a stimulating traveling companion.
Mr. Sudbury and his moralizing friend,
the Comte de Fersigny. are the two gen
tlemen who travel from one famous
chateau to another, and tell us of what
they see. On a rainy day they arrived at
Amboise: "The long gargoyles of the roof
catch the falling water, spcutinc it far
from the wall, and as they drip they dig
deep circular oasin3 in the sand." It Is
only half-heartedly that the writer for
gets the rain-hung loneliness of the pres
ent and tries to step back into the past.
Perhaps that is why the pictures he calls
to mind are such as tfiat of Charles
VIII's untimely death: of Catherine de
Medici's fear of "the fall cf a great edi
fice," which caused her to build a lonely
chamber standing upon four columns: and
of the conspirators of 1560. who looked like
"masses of â¢ â¢ â¢ somber tatters hang
ing from the balcony in the pale moon
light."
The rest of the travels are in happier
mood. He was ushered into Chenonceau
with much hospitality. He dared a bit of
criticism which the picture supports:
"The shade of trees, the lawns and gar
dens, which lend their softening notes to
ether castles, are at a distance here. The
glare of day intrudes Itself where the pri
vacy of shade were better placed. The
air of poetry, of something yet unseen. Is
lost to Chenonceau."
He rejoices in Blols and its lons-suns:
beauties. "In the center of all bursts
forth the staircase, which has delighted
an admiring world for so many centuries.
As we look at the staircase of Blois.
framed by the two columns of the clois
ter, darkened by heavy shadows, it seems
to fascinate the whole being. Its panels,
carved In such delicate tracery and lace
work that the finger nail might almost
break its symmetry; its groined roof,
with evpryvrhere the salamander and the
ermine holding a. royal crown: its intri
cately chiseled shaft, the backbone of it
all, which Is the best and which* the
least of these T' - - r
And again: "Here, royal persons of
history, whose canes stand cut in bas
relief against centuries of time, wound
their way in state processions to their
cpartments above. The stones are worn
by historic feet, whose masters have lonjr*
clnce passed away, but who live to-day
as vividly as if they were still younjr, still
powerful, still human and still wicked."

Kipling's Poem.
Rudyard Kipling's poem "The Absent
minded Beggar," Is new published by
Brontano, New York, in very attractive
form, paper ; covers, for 23 cents. The ty
pographical wark is pleasing ta the eye.
and as the text is printed on but one side
of heavy paper the edition makes a sou
venir worthy rebinding in leather. The
poem breathes the English patriotism of
the hour and is an appeal to thofee "who
stay behind to watch over and help the
ones dear to Tommy fighting for his coun
try at the front. Americans might learn
a lesson from the. sentiment expressed
that would prove a gentle reminder of the
cases of their own boys in blue. The
verses show the forceful hand of Kipling
so clearly that the signature at the end
seems almost superfluous. Witness the
closing stanza of the poem:
Let U6 manage so as later we caa look him ia

That, while he paved the empire, his employer

"Kate Wetherill."
Mrs. Gerald Lee, who has written for
the magazines ur.der the name of Jennett?
Perry, has published her first lons ttoiry.
'Kate Wetheriil." The book as a first at
tempt at continued narrative show? much
promise. The continuity of the story is
broken abruptly at times, showing, un
happily, the method <-,f shcrt story writ
ing. However, the character firaT.irg is
excellent. Certain types of the New Enc
landcr are drawn with a touch as True and
Cf-V.c&Xe A" that of Mary Wilk'.r.s. The'p'.ot
of the novel, the misfortunes fo'ltwing ihe
marriage cf a woman longing for aH that
ia beautiful and noble in Â«:fe with a man
unapprc-cfative cf his wife's attitude or
the finer.^is of her spirit, is a tragedy by
ro means confined to the region between
the I'erksh'rea und the Atlantic, although
the way in which the drama develops to
its sad er.^ing is perhaps particularly true
cf New England.
Kate Wetheriil at the time the story
cper.s. has been for many years the wife
cf a mechanic in a village cf Massachu
setts. In her g-rlhood she met young
Dave Wetheri!!, and with the trdor of
youth and cf her cwn enthusiastic tem
pcramest fancied him possessed of nob'e
qualities, which time and intimate rela
t'cr.^hip shewed him to be Â¦without. Weth
crS'l Â¦was only a cornmenp'ace fellow, and
his \*ulga.rity became accentuated as he
grew elder. Kate, finding herself becom
ing more and more cut of sympathy with
her husband, and yet feeling herse"f bound
to fulfill all the mere strictly her duties
as a wife, found amid uncongenial sur
roundings, consolaiion in reading the
maxims cf philosophers, much as might
have dene same Roman of republican
times.
The following extract from the book
shows how strongly the tastes of Mrs.
VTetherQ] clashed with her environment
and the unusual "method she employed to
distract her mind from cares which taxed
her strength ar.d self-contrcl so greatly
that they threatened her very life:
"The cruelty of fate was not a new
theme for Mrs. Wetherill's thought. For
nineteen years it had followed her about
the bet kitchen. When her children were
bcrr.. for the few cays of rest it had
pressed ck*? to her pillow. She had
grown useu to it. Sometimes she was
ifraii cf it- SLe tried through the long
tragic ending of a novel, but here one is
relieved when death comes as a release
to Kate, for with her tastes and tempera
ment, unless her husband had been bern
&r>fw. or the whole current of his
thoughts had changed, life with him at
best could have been only a compromise.

The Trust Conference
Hardly any event cf last year was the
subject of more general interest in this
country than the great conference oa
trusts held under the direction of the Civic
Federation cf Chicago- The thorn? itself
â¢was one which had long engaged the
earnest attention of the American r-eosile.
and the cemplc?:itiÂ«?s of the problems in
volved in it inevitably resulted in an in
finite variety cf opinions concerning it.
While a cor.siJcratle r-uicb^r of persons
wpre ready to pronounce judgment one
way cr the other upon the question, the
majority cf ir.teliitrer.t Americans rcces
nlzed that in the cfTr-cts wh'rli trusts Ji.ivt
prcfiuced in our industrial and commercial
systems '.here have, been both good ana
evil, and that it is no Â»-psy mattt-r to <ie
tcrrrnn* which cf the two outweighs the

Clever Sea Story.
An interesting ta!e of the sea, wlta
Bomethlnfe: of the da^h and spirit of Clark
Russell's cloTies, is "Mr. Trur.nell. Mate
of the Ship Piiate." The hero is a young
American, who has become stranded In
Australia and who i? compelled through
his poverty to ship as second mate on
l>card an American vessel with a very
unsavory record. Mr. TrunaeD. the first
mate, is an edd mixture of goour.ess and
rascality. Luckily on the voyage describ
ed he reveals the best side of himselfâ
very fortunately, as there are two rival
captains m beard, v.'hose presence causes
much cf the which makc3 thÂ«
story an absorbing one. The mysterious
identity of rcme of the persons on board
the Pirate, together with a mutiny and ".
fhlpwreek. help furnish the necessar/
t;uota of thrilling scenes without which
a story of sea life does not seem to fulfill
its purpose. (By L. Jenkins Hams. La

Lpsi Sunday I saw them com" in ones
end twos snd thref-s of them, and some
fame in the weariness of fapsina muscles
er.'i some brought curious, restless little
children because they must bring them or
for;?o the worship cf people together.
Great, vigorous men were there, such nr.d
to many as I have not seen before inside
church walls on a Sunday when the green
th::ps outside are newly green and the
ceiling of the park is of a color with the
blue, far away glimpses where north
bound streets come to their end. From
f.rs: to las-t these p^cple stand while they
watch green-robed priests moving slowly,
intricately through the royal gates: while
they '.isten to the voices that chant with
out accompaniment as It Is written.
Trinity Cathedral is an adapted house.
From without it gives no premise of Ori
ental gorgeousness. Within is the cnlor
rpilltr.g from high windows and the gleam
at rare ikons, gold draped, and
warmth of paintings. The monotony
solemn sound and the heavy fragrar
frem swaying censers and the presence
faith make all things drifting.
In the midst of priests and deacons T
taw the Bishop â the newly famous man.
He stood with his back to the people, and
fcr a time I knew only that his robe was
splendidly green and gold like the rest,
only more splendid, and that the miter
was beautiful with turquoises, and that
rxtneath It flowed long locks of yellow hair
that may or may not Indicate something
by Its fineness. I taw that the form of
the man was magnificent enough to be
long to the savage past or the enlight
ened future.
Bo much I watched during long and
ceaseless music, all of which was a mere
accompaniment to the organ tones of the
big faced proto deacon, who Is known to
people and clergy ss "the man of the
strong voice." Now and again I caught,
a glimpse of the Bishop's hand extended
for the kisses of ba.by acolytes, and I
thought the hand waus like a woman's. It
contradicted the power of the figure. And
I waited to ee<Â» the face.
Wren at last the man, the teacher, the
priest turr.ed. it was borne in upon me
that there was no contradiction after all.
The candle* had bÂ«e-n given to him. The
sigEÃ he made with them were mechani
cal. But while I understood not one word
cf his. I looked Into his face and I felt
that we were being blessed. I am sure
that he is gentle aÂ» st woman and strong
as a rr.an, and that is why he has been
chosen for a spiritual guide to both.
The race of him Is written in every fea
ture. Dully fair in coloring as Russians
are; wide and square of countenance as
the Russians are; clumsy of feature as
the Russians are. But the expression Is
one that claims no race, for it Is great
enough to be universal.
Father Sebastian Dabovlch, who Is the
Bishop's tireless assistant In charge of
Trinity Cathedral, has outlined the
Blsbop # s life for me. It seems that he
was the son of a parish priest Jn the Rus

cf his narrowly bounded father he went

For more than four months I have not
received a word from Tinka nor from her
family. 1 read in a Swedish journal, the
Aftonbladet. that Tinka is going to pub

William Powel.' That is all I know."
While sptaking. Mme. Sanz had emptied
her little trunk and had put its contents
in order in the drawers. Turning to her
friend, she asked:
"Where is the bathroom, dearest?"
"Oh, forgive me!" replied Romaine. "I
ke^p on talking and talking, forgetting
that you must long for a little rest and to
change your clothes. Come with me and
I'll show you. It is almost in front of
your door."
The lavatories occupied three rather
large rooms, whitewashed and provided
each with a galvanized iron bath and
with a shower.
"It isn't quite so luxurious as Free Col
lege," said Pirnitz. smiling. "But your
nickel buths. with polished manqgany
fittings, are much too expensive for us.
Would you believe it, this modest refine
ment is quite exceptional for a Paris
school? The parents are quite overcome
with surprise when they learn that our
pupils taue a bath every day! AVell. I
v.-iil leave you. See. the towels are in thi3
cupboard! Dvery one helps herself here."
"So do we, at Free College." replied
Mrne. Sanz. "I shail have finished in a
few moments!"
Pirniiz was returning to her room whon.
as she passed before that of Frederique,
the heard the sound of sobbing and of
siyhs. She listened a moment before the
closed door, then making up her mind,
she entered.
She found Lra sittir.sr upon the little
euueh that had been made for her. near
her elder Bister's bed. When she saw
Pirnitz she made a movement as though
to rise to her feel and run away. But
with a discouraged gesture shf sat down
again, showing ntr lace wet with tears.
Her beautiful brown hair, half undone,
veiled her forehead and cheeks.
Pirniiz sat down by her side and took
her hand. â¢ .
"Lea, my dear daughter."
The giri looked into Pirnitz' eyes as
though to find a little calm la their depths.
and their magnetic pawer almost imme
diately exercised Its infallible influence.
Lea ceased to sob ami the tears dried
upon her cheeks burned by their salt.
"A great sorrow, a new sorrow, has be
fallen >ou?" asked the apostle.
Lea made a sign that signified no.
"What is the matter, then?"
"1 am angry with myself." said the
yi;ur.g girl in a low voice. "1 am so weak,
so worthless!"
"Simply because the sight of Herminie
has overwhelmed your heart?" raid Pir
nitz, smiling. "And you inink yourself
weak and vanquished on account of that?
Well, would you like to hear a secret?
Mmc Sanz and I were admiring your
courage a few minutes ago."
"I aespise myself!" replied Lea, with a
sort or" narshness quite unexpected from
that refined mouth. _L
Then throwing her arms around Pir
nitz' neck, she cried:
"Ah! Romain^! I am worthless. I am
worthless' All my strength has l^ft me.
And I-.I don't knowâ l am no longer sure
whether I do not deceive you in remain
ing liere v.'ith you and with the others. I
am not sure whether my life be not a
hideous lie!"
"I don't understand you." said Pirnitz.
"What do you mean by your life being a
lie? I really don't understand you."
"Yes. I He!" replied Lea. speaking in
Pirnitz's ear. but emphasizing the sylla
bles as though she forced herself to utter
them. "I am ashamed of myself; 1 am
htrt: amid you all: I do the same things
that you do; I recommend and glory in
the work that we have created here with
the ardor that you all display; Duyvecke.

future Eve, the Noblw Maiden. My lip;
speak of nothing but such things. And
it angers me."
"Why?"
"Because my thoughts are not In my
words." cried the girl. "I do not think. I
do not really live among you! I tell you
that I lie. ar.d the lie has become insup
portable to me!"
She unclasped her arms from about Pir
nitz's ntck, rose and began to walk thÂ«
room.
"If you only knew the emptiness of mj
life! 1 no longer desire anything. I hayÂ«
no faith in anything. My heart is not in
anything. If the school were to disap
pear to-morrow, were it to be burned
down, I believe I should look on quite

they may become what they choose; they
may go away, they may detest me. I
don't care. If I were to see them dying
I could not weep a single tear! Ah, Pir
nitz. I am so unhappy!"
Er**ct. her eyes dry now and shining
feverishly, she leaned with rigid arms
upon Frederique's bed. Pirnitz, who had
not moved from the little couch upon
which she had taken a seat, tried to meet
thf glance of the rebel, but Lea's eyes
v/( re downcast, as though she feared the
mysterious hypnotic influence she had
yielded to so often. She wanted to re
lievp her soul, to cry aloud her despair.
"What is the good of living here," she
continued, "amid you all who are so sin
cere and perfect? My presence here is hjr
riliie; you must realize that, Romaine!
I have'no longer any faith. My thoughts
are elsewhere, my heart is seared I be
lieve In nothing: I hope foi nothing! I
cm sure, sureâ do you understand? -that
I was not made to fellow and imitate such
exceptional creatures as Frederique and
yourself!"
Pirnitz did not reply.
"There is another horrible feature,"
continued Lea. At certain moments I
seem as though I were two people. I ap
pear before myself rid of all that you
and Frederique have Inculcated in me. I
assure you I t?ee myself as though I were
another living person. I see the Lea
Surier I should have been had not Fred
crique, so to speak, captivated me from
mv very infancy, had she not grafted her
thoughts and her will upon mine, and had
you not arrived, in your turnâ you, who
could make the stones follow you with
your magic glance. And now"â
She clasped her fingers on the bar of
the little brass bedstead and her breath
seemed to fail her.
"And now I should have been some
thing very vile, very miserable, a daugh
ter of Paris, like the others. Neither you
nor Frederique can demolish the Inheri
tance left me by my parents; my father,
conscienceless, a man who married a Kirl
who had been seduced and who was about
to become a mother, solely for money; my
mother, a woman capable of accepting
*ucn v barpain and of loving a man who
would make It! Ah! I am saying horrio'o
things! Romaine ! Romaine! Have pity
upon mo! Take me to your heartl Keep
me! Have pity!"
Her rerves suddenly unstrung, she fei*
at Pirnitz's feet like a disjointed mario
nette. She hid her head- upon the bosom
cf the little careworn woman and, almost
lying on the ground, gave way entirely,
opening the floodgates of her tears. Pir
nitz passed her long, frail, wasted and
pentle hands over the girl's tangled hair.
She eald nothing, but waited for Lea's
first glance.
The young girl's brow and eyei finally
appeared timidly among the curls of
liquid bronzes. A humble voice, very dif
ferent from that which uttered such blas
phemy a few moments before, rose In
supplication.
"I have ppoken some hideous words.
You cannot pardon me, Romaine! I feel
It! And yet. if you send me away from
you I shall die!"
Pirnitz at last succeeded In meeting that
wandering gaze and from that moment
wae sure of her mastery over the younx
girl.
"When you were little, Lea," she said.
"Frederique has told me that" you were
quickly aroused to anger. She used to tell
you when she saw the storm about to
break. 'You are going mad!* And that
phrase Invariably calmed you."
"Dear Fedi!"
"You have been mad for a moment It
was not you speaking a few seconds ago.
The proof is that you could not now re
peat the words you said. It was the other
Leaâ you are quite right about thatâ who
uttered them. But do not think you are

SheÂ°held out her hand. He took It and
with an awkward, though touching move
ment, he laid his cheek upon it Duy
vecke blushed and drew her hand away
gently For some time they did not speulr.
Duyvecke rolled strawberries as red aa
her lips in the sugar, and Kemineau. Iwui
lng back in a graceful Regency urrachair.
"All the same." he repeated, "it la really
a convent, since you cannot marry.
"What gave you that idea, Komi . iou

"Oh: 1 said liemineau. wita a boldre-3

would not accent her."
"Yes. we shouldâ at least I think soâ on
condition, of course, that the husour.d did
not live with his wife!"
"Well, that Is not being married.
Duyvecke, without seeking to explain to>
herself the reason, the curious pleas
ure in exposing Pirniiz'3 doctrines to
Remineau. She often returned to the sub
ject in her conversations with nim. m
though she felt some particular desire t<>
convince him. But dhe found a disciple at
once respectful and obstinate in the arti
san sculptor, a man harder to carve tr.au
the oak in which he worked.
"You understand. Remi." she continued.
"we are much ireer so long as we are u:.
married. We have more time to devote to>
our little ones." â . '
"Bah! If you were all marriedâ all tr.Â»
women who are united in your schoolâyou
could occupy your time with your own
little ones."
"What about the little boy 3 and girl.-*
without parents? Who would look after
them? I cannot realize that it Is you who
speaks to me in such a way, Remi; you.
whose son is motherless!"
"Oh! You need not be cruel to tho llttla
orphans; you could bring them up with,
your own. Each would help according to
her means, and the rich would maka up
for the poor."
He became silent; words failed him tn.

communism which lies at tho bottom oT
the soul of all honest workman, a dream
born of a sentiment of brotherhood In
days without work and without food.
â¢ : Xo," replied Duyvecke. "those are)
mere theoretical ideas, Keml! In prac
tice parents always find they have, nn;
enough for themselves. They avoid th>Â»
burden of another mouth to feed. We*
must have mothers without children for
the motherless children."
"But all your children are not or
phans," interrupted Kemineau.
"Those who are badly brought up by
their mothers are mosc to be pitied. Do
you think the little ones taught by Mile.
Pirnitz. Mile. Heurteau, Germaine and tha
others" â
"And by you. Mile. Duyvecke, you par
ticularly!"
â¢Do you believe that they will not b*
better than the girls whom we see grow
ing up in Paris homes with their fathers
and mothers?"
"Well, one must adrntt." confessed Ttc
rr.ineau, "that their conduct for the most
part is not very commendable."
"How could it be? They are not taught
any morality. All that they learn is that
they are to sell themselves to the highest
bidder and that a child is a misfortune!
They have abominable examples perpetu
ally before their eyes! Ah! Remineau,
the paternal dwelling is a danger for
many a girl in Paris! We ought to take
them all away."
The artisan sculptor did not reply. With
his chair drawn back from the table and
his arms hanging between his knees hÂ»
contemplated his plate.
"Well. Keml! What have you to say?"
asked Duvvecke triumphantly.
"You can talk better tnan i can. made
moiselle." replied Remineau. "You have*
studied and have an answer ready for
everything. All the same, girls are made
to be married, in the first place, and in tho
second to be mothers. And those who ara
pure and charitable can also be kind to
those around them, and thus da good."
Duyvfctke's gaze, perhaps, in spite of
herself, appeared to encourage him, and
he continued with a little more assurance:
"Listen to me â it is only a suppositionâ
Euppose that you. mademoiselle, instead
of belonging to a sort of sisterhood in the
Rue dcs Vergers, instead of living in a
kind of conventâ no, not a conventâ 4f you
like, it is better than a convent â it is
more frank, there is less mummery and
secrecy in it â well, suppose you were not
living with those women, you would have
found a straightforward good fellow, who
would love you with all his heart, who
would be ready to lay down his life for
you, who would consider you as the real
divinity you are. For, although I do not
know any of those ladles, I doubt whether
there are two like you!"
He stopped, confused by his own elo
quence.
Duyvecke. smiling and blusMr.g a little,
met hi 3 gaze, and then he lust the thread
of his speech completely.
"What was I saying?" he stammered,
with such a pitiable air that Duyveck*
burst out laughing. "I don't know what
I was saying. Oh! Mademoiselle Duy
vecke you are making fun of me."
There was a little reproach in the sculp
tor's voice. Duyvecke rose and took his
hand and said:
"No Remi, I am not making fun of you.
You know that I like you very much. I
am so glad to be here, near Gastcn, and
near you!"
"Is that true?" asked Remlneau, hla
coffee-colored eyes shining brilliantly.
"Yes," said Duyvecke. suddenly
thoughtful. "Our lives arrange them
selves as best they can. Rerai. We do not
always do as we should like," she added,
her voice a little saddened.
Remineau. who had kept the young
gtrl'a hand in his own, touched it with his
stunblv lips. She did not prevent him.
Then she said gently;
"Go and see haw Gaston Is. I will put
the things in order."
"Oh! Mile. Duyvecke. It is I who
should â "
"No! go."
He obeyed her. Duyvecke cleared thÂ«
table and put all the articles in order
with methodical and yet adroit delibera
tion. From time to time she stopped in
her work. Standing pensively, the first
finger of her l^ft hand caressing the tip
of her ear, a gesture habitual with her.
she reflected. As she shut the door of the
cupboard some one rar.g at the door of
the apartment. She heard Remlneau ga
to open it.
"Is it the doctor already?" Â«bÂ« won

She took the lamp and carried It Into
the room of the little invalid, who awcli*
immediately and cried:
"Mamma Vecke!"
She ran to the bedside, and leaning over
It kiÂ«sed the little head, with its tangled
curls. His face had almost recovered its

11 The' tenants, the concierge aâ¢ l ,. llll ***
familiar, gossiping occupants of the mod
est residence of hard working citizens
teased Duyvecke about him whom they
called her lover. They introduced this
lover of six to her, and. as a matter of
fact, the tirst time she spoKe to him he
blushed, became confused and dared not
utter a word. But Duyvecke's kindness
and cheerful activity soon conquered hia
embarrassment, and little Remineau soon
worshiped like a mother her whom he
called ".Mama Vecke."- Friendly relations
were thus established between the two
neighbors. Duyvecke, who was very
obliging, took an interest in the mother
less household, to which she was at
tracted by the chilu. Remineau welcomed
Duyvecke as a sort of Providence, and
surrounded her with respect and devout
admiration. The reputation in the house
and in the quarter of the two creatures
was so excellent that no one risked even
a supposition or a malicious explanation
of their friendship. . , .
At this period Duyvecke was already In
the hands of one of her former primary
school mistresses. Mile, fleurteau. who
had now left the official instruction, it
was Mile. Heurteau, interested as shewas
in feminist doctrine, who molded Duy
vecke's gentle spirit, although at bottom
Duyvecke was totally indifferent about all
theoretical speculation. It was -she who
took her to the Sainte-Parade gathering
in the Rue de (Jrenelle and introduced ncr
to Pirnitz. Duyvecke was extremely sen
sitive to goodness anil nobleness of char
acter. She was sociable and affectionate.
She loved Pirnitz. loved Frederique, Lea,
Daisy Craggs and Germaine Soubize. She
was powerless to resist the attraction of
their superior intelligence and stronger
will. A single link bound her to the Kue
Cujas. and she refused to think that one
day it would be necessary to break it. bhe
had ended by loving little Remineau as
though she had been his veritable mother.
Her equable temperament accepted the
idea of celibacy without any more diffi
culty than'it caused Pirnitz or Frederique;
but she needed the sweetness of those in
fantile eyes lixed upon hers, the kisses of
a childish mouth, the p!ay. the cries ami
chatter of a little one around her smiling
tranquillity.
Duyvecke remained in her old residence
whiie the school was being constructed at
Bt. Charles. When it was inaugurated, in
December, 1?97. ah* had to go and live in
it. This was a common necessity for those
who formed Mile, de Sainte-Parade's gen
eral staff. Kemineau, who would have
died rather than allow Duyvecke to divine
the sentiments that were working in his
heart except through his timid and im
passicned fervor, said nothing, but simply
looked with touching, despairing affection
a* her who was Sbout to go away. But it
was impossible to till the truth to little
Gaston. Extremely nervous, the child be
came pale and began to weep whenever
he had to leave his "Mamma Vecke." even
for a moment. They had to invent a story
for him. Duyvet ke was going to nursj
one of her relatives who was ill. and
would come back again.
Nevertheless, the poor girl, with broken,
heart, obeyed these who laid out her life
for her. "She knew the cniid asked for
her continually. Although she went to see
him upon every occasion, he declined
Elowly. At the end of a few weeks Gas
ton, who a< tirst had believed in Duy
vecke's early return, began to lose confi
dence. He questioned his father for a
time, and the father did not know what to
reply. Then he said no more, lost his ap
petite and anaemia resulted. When Duy
vecke could escape from the school and
pats an hour In the Rue de Cujas he re
vived a little and manifested a feverish
Joy but the young girl's departure ai
ways left him pining and fading away.
He' was attacked by bronchitis in Febru
ary, recovered with difficulty and in June
fell ill again. Duyvecke. harassed by re
morbe and convinced that she was the
cause of the child's malady, dared not
face Remineuu's mute reproach nor break
that which she regarded as a formal con
tract with Pirnitz and Mile. Heurteau.
She blushed with confusion when she said
\o her colleagues. "I am goins to Ruo
Cujas." precisely because 4he mistresses
were bound by no disciplinary regulations
ar.d were free to act as they thought best.
To-day when she had begged Pirnitz to
find some one to replace her the apostle's
regard had troubled her more than ever
The taper cast gently oscillating rings
of light and shade on the ceiling. The
child's breathing became slower and more
measured. For some time Remineau and
Duyvecke concentrated all their attention
and ali their thoughts upon the respira
tion rising from the little bed. They dared
not speak. When the gasping breathing
became more even and peaceful they
looked at one another and smiled.
"Do you hear, Remi?"
"Yes, the doctor was right; he Is bet
ter."
Duyvecke rose and went upon the tips
of her toea to look at the little patient.
Remineau followed her. He remained a
little behind the young girl and avoided
even touching her. Duyvecke took Gas
ton's left hand, which in his agitation he
had liberated from the coverlet upon
which it was resting with his little blue-
Phirted arm. He did not wake, although
he instinctively caressed Duyvecke's
hand.
"He has no longer any fever," she mur
mured. "We have only to let him sleep."
"What about his medicine?"
"Oh! as for that, give it him when he
wakes. The important thing now is to let
him sleep. Do not let us stop here. "We
might wake him."
They returned to the dining room. A
big, ordinary lamp, with iron oil recepta
cle and with a green cardboard shade, lit
up the table and threw a warm light on
the Louis XV credence and the curved
Â¦ cupboard, delic'ously carved with Khellj,
foliage and a network of branches.
"Are you not hungry. Mile. Duyvecke?"
asked Remlneau. "It is time for supper."
"Well, to tell the truth. I should like to
eat something," said Duyvecke, recover
ing her gayety now that she was reas
sured. "I have a terrible appetite, Remi
neau. I. who ought to fast in order to be
come a little thinner!"
Remineau, who was taking plates and
eatables out of the cupboard, protested
energetically.
"Ah! ICo! You are lucky to have such
good health and such a fresh complexion,
Mile. Duyvecke. Nothing Is so ugly, in
my idea, as a woman who is too thin.
They always look like English women.
Ah! Here is a pate that I bought ex
pressly for you; some Holland cheeseâ l
know you like itâ and some strawber
ries!"
"Oh! Remi. you thought of me amid all
your sorrow? Dear Remi."
Touched with his thoughtfulness. Duy
vecke looked at Remlneau while helnln?
him to spread a white table cloth. Sud
denly confused, he let a fork fall upon the
kinky rug, which represented a tiger wan
dering in a wild landscape.
â¢â¢What a stupid, clumsy devil I am." he
muttered. "Oh! I beg your pardon, made
moiselle!"
How often, when the pretty Fleming
lived in the house in the Rue Cujaa, had
she taken supper with Remineau, the
child between them, amusing them with
his chatter! Since she had been living at
the school this humble enjoyment had
been very rarely Indulged in, and through
Its very rarity it was more precious.
Duyvecke even reproached herself inno
cently for being so contented this evening
when little Gaston was not with them,
and for feeling happier, more at home,
face to face with the honest features of
the artisan than with the refined counten
ances of Pirnitz and Mile. Heurteau. Yes,
it was sad, but indisputable; she was
more Interested in the talk of the sculptor
about his work, about the observations of
his son. the little gossip of the inhabitants
of the house, than in the Intellectual con
versation of Frederique, of Pirnitz, and
Mile. Heurteau. .;
"It must be because I am etupid. and
not worthy of living in their midst." sho
â¢ thought.
As for Remineau, he was quite cheerful.
The relief from i a terrible anxiety, hap
piness of having Duyvecke with him In
his dining-room, at his table, almost In
toxicated him. But all at once he became
uneasy.
"You will not go away any earlier oe
cause the little one is better, will you,
tMlle. Duyvecke?"
"No, Remi. I asked Germaine Soubize.
the girl who has studied medicine, to come
for me after the supper of the pupils.
She 13 very familiar with children's mal
adies. I have more confidence Â¦In lier
than in your doctor.**
"And shall you go back to the school,
then?"
"Of course, Remi. You do not suppose
that I am going to sleep In the street?"
Remineau flushed under his dark skin,
covered with black hair. He remained
silent for some time, then, choosing his
words carefully and making an effort to
express his Ideas clearly, he said:
"Your school is a very fine establish
ment. It is well built and well furnished
It looks like a convent. At least, that 13
the effect It produces upon me. It is very
handsome, very comfortable, Just like a
convent."
Duyvecke smiled, showing her pretty lit
tle teeth, as nearly as those of a child
"Why, no, Remi. It is not in the least
like a convent. We take no vows and have
no conventual rules. You .can see for
yourself, we come out Just when we like.
IX I were In a convent could I have comt
tile companion, who suffers the yoke of
truth with Impatience."
'â¢Not you. Pirnitz; not you! You have
never been anything other than the
woman whom we admire. You are a
eaint."
"Must I tell you once more," replied the
apostle, "that 1 am not a woman? Look
at me." â, .
"Do not say it! Do not say it! cried
Lea. "1 know what you are going to say.
I will not listen to it! You are mere beau

"The idea of leaving us?"
"Even that has occurred to me. And yet
I do not believe that I could ever leave
you. Where should I go? All is finished
for me now! Perhaps those whom I have
loved no longer think of me."
Her face was contracted with a spasm
of anguish. .
"I shall never leave you." she continued,
"but I am no longer with you. I live in the
past. It enshrouds me. I cannot succeed
in freeing myself from it. Sometimes you

"And the finances?" asked Mme. Sanz.
"There has been no lack of money to

"She is rich, is she not?"
Pirnitz made a doubting gesture,
"How is one to know? She gives us no

A resigned Eai3;Â«ss shone In Pirnitz's

but one felt that no reverse, no disap

They both left the window. Mme.

Ali four went down the staircase, Pirnitz

her arm to Mme. Sans, who could only
walk slowly.

mistresses' places were among those oi
the pupils, a system that did away with
any necessity for supervision. Most or
the girls were already standing around
the tables. Mme. Sanz, Lea, Frederique

chatting together at the door of the room.
One of them, Daisy Craggs, had the red

Mme. Sanz shook the hands held out to
her.
"Mile. Heurteau has not yet arrived?
asked Pirnitz.
"Here she is." said Germalne.
A woman of about 10. rather tall, with
nn agreeable grave ountennnce and very
black hair, came along the corridor, read
ing- a pamphlet. She raised her eyes and
smiled amiably at Mme. Sanz.
"I am delighted," she said, "to meet
the lady principal of Free College, about
which I hive read so many marvelous
things. What do you think of our modest
school?"
"I breathe in it the same air of liberty
and of truth as In Free College, and that
Is the only thing of any importance," re
plied Mme. Sanz. "Dear Pirnitz infuses
the same generous sap into all the organ
isms that she creates."
Mile. Heurteau led Jltnc Snnz to the
place of honor on her right. Frederitjue
sat on the other side of the visitor. As
she was going to her place Duyvecke said
to Pirnitz:
"I should like you to get some one to
replace me this afternoon, my dear. I
have received a telegram from poor Re
mineau. His little boy is not very well.
They are afraid he is threatened with
mucous fever. The poor fellow is ter
rified and beseeches me to come and help

I "Very well, Duyvecke," Pirnitz replied.
t She said nothing more, but she looked
Â¦ at the lair haired girl with eyes so pene
trating that a sudden wave of confusion
empurplod the white flesh of her fresh
visage to the very roots of the hair nest
ling above her little, smooth forehead.
CHAPTER V
"You will come to see the child again,
won't you, doctor? We shall expect you."
"Yes; I will tryâ after dinner. Shall you
be here then, mademoiselle?"
"Oh, I shall stay as late as I possibly
can."
"Very well: I shall probably run in
again this evening."
Badly dressed, with tangled hair, soiled
linen, a dusty frock coat and a silk hat,
brushed the wrong -way, the doctor of the
quarter, who was already turning down
the staircase, smiled back at pretty Duy
vecke leaning over the rail. But Duy
vecke paid no attention to smiles. She
simply called down the staircase, where
the massive shoulders and tall hat of the
doctor were disappearing:
"We shall expect you, doctor."
She went in, and the door closed. In
the dark vestibule a brief Instant of
thought caused her to frown. Then she
returned to the room, where the child,
flushed with fever, was moaning in his
sleep.
Remlneau was watching, seated by the
head of the little, bed. Duyvecke made a
sign for him to follow her into the next
room, which was the dining room. Some
very pretty Louis XV furniture, in solid
wood, cunningly carved, was rather a sur
prise in surroundings of such mediocrity.
For about three years Remineau had em
ployed every leisure moment in making
a complete set of furniture, which he re
fused to sell, reserving it for some myste
rious reason, which he kept to himself.
"Well, what did the doctor say?"
Remineau's brown, hairy face became
still more overclouded. Anxiety caused
his black beard to tromble with emotion.
"He will come again this evening," re
plied Duyvecke. "He says that It is- not
grave. It is not a grave attack."
"Is that quite true. Mile. Duyvecke?"
"Why, yes, R.eml, quite true. I would
not hide the real situation from you. The
doctor, believes it's a little touch of meas
les of no importance."
"Ah. that confounded little rascal!
What a fright he has given me! All the
same, It's surprising how- much better he
is the very instant you arrive!
â¢ "Only, you see," the poor wretch added,
his arms hanging limp and his eyes
downcast, "you will have to go away very
soon. Mile. Duyvecke, to return to your
school. What shall we do then?"
"I will stay as long as I can, Remi.
Don't be so uneasy."
She returned to the sick room. As she
passed before him Remlneau, unnoticed
. by her, stooped quickly and kissed a fold
of her dress.
A night light Illuminated the room
faintly. They sat down by the window
near each other. For a few moments they
listened to the little patient's breathing In
silence. The rings of light marked by the
taper oscillated on the ceiling. No sound
could be heard from the street below.
Duyvecke HesDel and Remineau had
known each ovner for about four years.
When Duyveche came from Haze^brouck
to. Paris to study for her advanced
diploma as teacher she took a 'lodging In
a nouse at 17 Rue Cujas, on the floor
above the one occupied by Remineau. Al
though a very humble house it was very
well tenanted, thanks to the watchful
. ness of the old proprietress, who was very
severe on the subject of conduct, and
who lived on the ground floor. Remlneau,
very hard working and timid, had been a
widower for about two years. Duyvecke,
thoughtful and studious, would never
have gone further than to say "Good day"
as they met upon the staircase had It
not been for little Gaston. The child, then
about 6 years of aze. immediately- manl-
these things. Life goes on around me in a
vague phantasmagoria. And it is not
alone Buch visions that harass me, al
though they are so vivid that they even
efface the reality. I- am continually tnlnK
ing, meditating, about past events; I am
perpetually wondering about the ideas
that have prompted the action of others,
dreaming what I myself should have done.
Such thoughts are frightful! I have been
angry with you, with my sister Fedi. I
can never, never dare to tell you what I
have thought of Frederique."
"If you were to .tell me it would ease
your heart," murmured Pirnitz, tenderly.
"Well." Lea continued, still kneeling at
the' apostle's feet. "I have gone^over all
the details of our life in London.
1 remember Ferdl'B attitude the even
ing Tinka told her of our mystic
betrothal after the memorable afternoon
spent on the moors of Hampstead Heath.
I remember FedPw conduct during the
period of our betrothal and the day I re
turned terrified from Richmond, and,
finally, here when she spoke. *o harshly
to Georg the evening of our last inter
view."
"Well?" asked Pirnitz, seeing that the
young girl hesitated to continue.
"Well I have a horrible idea. But It has
gradually imposed itself upon me, grown
in me, ah idea that I despise and yet that
I cannot drive away. Oh! do not ask me
what it is, Romaine! I cannot tell you.
upon my soul I cannot! It is too hide
ous'"
. "You think Frederique was Jealous of
you or jealous of Georg?"
Lea, her face hidden in Pirnitz's bosom,
made a movement that signified yes.
"Does Frederique know this?" asked
Pirnitz.
"Oh! no. I would not have her know it
fop the world! I think 1 should die of
shame. You see how wicked, how un
worthy I am!"
She rose to her feet, her gaze fixed on
the ground, awaiting her sentence.
"Lea," Bald Pirnitz, "we are not mis
tresses of our thoughts, but we must not
let them tyrannize over us. We must stop
them as they arise; look them straight in
the face. Frederique Jealous of you?
Jealous with common, low. human jeal
ousy? I doubt it! Her mind is too noble!
But even were it so, what of it? Let
us look' at the matter under its most im
possible aspect; even did she love, or had
she loved Georg, who does not love her,
but you, would her attitude not be all the
more admirable? She has not betrayed
her feeling. You. yourself, have only Juat
perceived this Jealousy, and even you are
not certain. If you wish to know my
opinion, I believe she was Jealous, but
jealous for you, jealous for her Lea. Sho
was jealous when I made your acquaint
ance in the Rue de la Sourdiere. She was
Jealous that I should take part of your
affection away from her. She. admitted
it to me. Think, then, how her big heart
must have suffered when a man con
quered you completely!" '
Lea bowed her head. Pirnitz continued
in a voice gradually firmer and more dom
inating.
"The past Is dead. Lea. Think of It no
longer. You "must not! Let the dead bury
their dead. You have been temped by hu
man love! I myself once offered you the
choice between the admirable existence
of an unselnsh aposUe and that of the
ordinary woman. You freely chose to be
the noble maiden, the heroic laborer for
feminine emancipation. You are still free.
This school la not a prison. The doors
There was no supervision, no lines form
eu no silence -insisted upon. Each one
went to the dining room as she pleased.
A.most all -went l~ tne first place to the
lavatory, for cleanliness at table was par
ticularly inculcated. Lea looked at the
scene mournfully.
"There is your family. Lea," said Ro
maine. "It is too late now to abandon it.
You belong to tnose little ones. They be
lieve in you. Come, my dear child, have
courage! Dry your tears. 1 do not want
Mme. Sanz to perceive your anguish.'
"Alas!" said Lea. "I should like to
avoid seeing her. I should like to hide
myself.** Ah! Romaine, I am no credit to
you! .Why do you wish to raise me to
your level?" Â¦
"You are no credit to yourself if you
allow yourself to be bewitched by the
remembrance of a man who certainly does
not think of you"
â¢ Â¦ "Oh! Romaine."
"Who does not think of you as you
think of him. I wish to see you free,
really free."
"I will try." ;*.
"And you will succeed. It is only a pass
ing crUis. Impose upon yourself the dis
cipline of doing your daily duty here, and
little by little all evil Ideas will evapo
rate."
The door opened, a tall young woman
with dark hair, a pale complexion, dark
eyes and noble, clearly cut features ap
peared. She did not see, or pretended not
to see, Lea's agitation, and eald, smil
ing at Pirnitz:
"They tell me that Mme. Sanz haa ax
rived; where is she? In her room?"
"No, Fedi." replied Pirnitz; "she Is tak
ing a bath."
"Ah! Have you shown her her room?"
"Yes."
"Have you seen her, Lea?" â¢Â¦â¢Â¦ . .
"Yes," murmured Lea.
Fredcrique took her hand, and looking
at her with her calm, intelligent eyes, she
said: , v v, o
"It was necessary that she came and
that you see her again. One must meas
ure the strength of one's heart. A passing
pain is of no account. You will be strong
er than your memories. I also have
thought about London more than usual
since I heard that Mme. Sanz was com
ing. And sometimes I am bo perturbed,
for thoughts of the past are painful. They
prove that we are but feeble and change
able creatures. Let us help one another
to become strong."
Pirnitz, who was watching the two sis
ters attentively, thought ahe saw Lea
tremble at the touch of the elder's hand
and try to release herself with an Involun
tary gesture. The eyes of the apostle,
which sought in vain those of the erring
child, filled with sadness.
"Mme. Sanz has returned to her room,"
Eaid Lea.
They heard the sound of footsteps In the
neighboring room, and a few seconds aft
erward Mme. Sanz entered.. â¢ .
"Ah! Fedi, my dear child!"
She did -not kiss her Immediately, but
held her by the wrists and looked at her.
"You are more beautiful than ever," she
murmured. "The reflection of your noble
life ehihes In your eyes. My dear girl,
what happiness, lt is for me to see you
again!" ' - . -
She kisÃed her. upon both cheeks. The
serenity of the manner and the words of
Mme. Sana gave them a sort of beauty
that even touched Lea's lacerated heart-
Contemplating Pirnitz, Frederique and
Mme. Sanz, the three apostles, whose
tranquil souls could be seen as it were in
their features, she felt a : violent thrill ofbeneath my cot. About one-third of the
contents had been consumed, when, awak
ening one morning. I found It gone. It
did not seom probable that any one out
side the hospital could have taken It, and
the patients in the ward wore too weak,
even could they have secured It without
detection from the attendants.
Nor did this case of th^ft stand alone.
Many of the men lost articles of value
which , they had brought with them to
the hospitals. I personally know of goods,
from shoes to barber's tools, having dis
appeared. And thievery does not stand
unique as a shame against the record of
our hospital corps'.
Another incident rises before me now.
Across the room from where I lay stood
the cot of a volunteer stricken. If I mis
take not, with spinal meningitis. Each
day he grew weaker, and finally, as ho
came near to death, he raved pitifully.
crying out at times in strange sentences
or asking for the dear ones at home. One
evening the attendant stopped at his cnt
and must have been hit by the struggling,
delirious man. The attendant returned
the blow, and. calling the dying man by
a vile name, bade him "hurry up and die."
The volunteer was carried out dead the
next morning.
Yet another. I recall the boy vividly,
for his cot was for a time Immediately
next to mine and he was transferred with
me from the navy yard hospital to the
hospital in the town of Cavite. The boy
told me he was shortly to have graduated
from one of the San Francisco high
schools. He had i zen ill for a month with
the fever, and as he heard the taps of life
he, too, raved and cried In his delirium.
Often In the middle of the night I heard
him calling of home, of his father, of his
mother. "You ," I re
member they said to him bo many times
that It tore my heart, "why don't you
die?" He died as the other. And they
both were Americans!

THIS Â«5 the ncry of life In the
American military hospitals on the
lslar.d of Luzon. It is largely the
tale of hospital suffering, endured
by a private in the First California
Jlegirnent of United States Volunteer In
fantry. That private was myself.
In the month of May of the year IS3S
Â¦tranjre cries echoed down the football
field at Stanford University. Whr-re once
the student throat rooted the college yells,
r.ow etrar.cely silent, the student body
Â¦watched a platoon of thirty odd men in
blue and brass, wheeling and charging in
military evolution. On the 23th of May
three chips dipped over the horizon car
rying on board the thirty students.
In a month these three ships steamed
m-est and south, rounded north of a land
covered with palms, ran down the China
Eea, and bow to 6tern, following their
convoys, the cruisers Charleston and Bal
timore, they Fteamed down the bay of
Manila and let slip their anchors under
the puns of Dewey.
We had been asnore at Cavlte for some
tmo vreÂ«ks, when one morning something
buzzed In my head, my hands were dry
tr.fl hard and the Filipino boys grinned
over the ration which I could not cat.
That afternoon as we were returning from
c"rfll I fell out cf line exhausted and bare
ly able to get to my quarters. The next
cay when the bugle piped elck call I
dragged myse'.f wearily to "the surgeon's
quarters and there, too weak to await my
turn in the line, eat down upon a bench
without; The rain was falling, but I did
not mind, fcr it was cool and pleasant to
my fever. <
At ienpth It was my turn. I put out
xny tongue and answered a question. ,
"Pill sev'.n, steward," said the surgeon/
PHI number seven was out.
"Well, pill nine, then. Can't drill. you(
ear? Devil of a lot of you can't drill â
you're rxcusr-A for two days." ;>
I pent back to quarters with Pill Num-v
ber Nine. The next morning, at the de-"
xnand of the major, I was carried to the;
emergency hospital within the fortlflca-.
tions.
Two weeks passed before I could be*
tra referred to the main Cavite hospital.'
The hours dragged with terrible weari-(
Bess. The heat was unrelieved by even a]
cool drink. The dripping of the cool
springs and the tinkle of the brooks .it',
home mocked my thiret. I would ask for
Â¦watcr and be given a lukewarm stuff from/
the jar In the ward. J
The torture of the mosquitoes was un
provided against, for strangely enough(
two weeks had sufficed to exhaust the
netting of the department. Why It was/
not brought from the town I do not know,;
for It was to be had and later my com
pany mates bcusht a quantity of It and(
stretched it upon a frame above me. Our J
cots were made of half-round rigid banw

harshness. They were but little relieve!
by the thin cotton mattresses and soont
became Indescribably wearisome, cspc-*
dally to the dysentery patient, who must/
â¢Jwavs lie upon his back. Emaciation andi
those couches gave the men terrible bed
sores.
There Is one pleasant memory in those
weeks of suffering. Th" memory of an
Incident so *arge In generosity as to make
of me a life-long debtor. I was carried
one day from the general to the measles
ward. I was tired ur.to death with the
long bedridden time." There was in the
new ward but three spring cots and these
already occupied. Nothing was left but
bamboo frames and upon one of these I
was lifted.
Suddenly a voice came from one of the
cots, "Nurse. I'm getting better and can
stand itâ give that man my cot; I'll take
the frame." They transferred me and
putting my hand out I said, "I hate to
take your springs, old man. but my back's
in a tad way and God knows they're wel
come." I started to tell him that he
was one in a million but he stopped me,
"Never rr.ir.d, old man. it's nothingâ we're
brother soldiers and you need it worse
than I."
He used afterward at my request to tell
me stories of the streams and lakes and
camping tripsâ anything of the cool and
fresh outdoors. Ido not know his name,
but he was a musician of the Colorado
Regimental Eand, one of those who after
ward stood in the swamp at Malate, and,
while the troops charged, played "A Hot
Time in the Old Town."
Somewhere in thÂ«Â» disposition of hos
pital stores there must have been a gross
mismanagement. It was no more than
three weeks after our landing at Cavlte
when, as the surpeon made his rounds, I
asked if I might have some brandy."Cer
tainly," he replied, "if you can get it,
nothing better; but the supply is ex
hausted." I wondered then, as I do now.
If it were possible that the liquors In
tended for the sick and dying soldiers
could have been responsible for the condi
tion in which I too frequently saw cer
tain of the. commissioned officers of the
City of Peking. It seems beyond 'belief,
yet not more so than that the medical de
partment should have exercised so little
foresight as to leave an army, bound for
a climate known to be disastrous, with in
sufficient of the common medical necessi
ties for a month's use.
A few days subsequent to my conversa
tion with the Burgee! I was visited by our
chaplain, the Rev. Father McKinnon, and
he, whose kindness prompted many a good
act, brought me some from a private
source. I was accustomed to place thw
bottle containing the liquor upon the flo'ir
Pathos punctuated each day. There is
one incident pigeon-holed in my memory

He asked me if I ever prayed and to

charged with faking illness. I turned to
the wall and wept.
These are the dark and blurred pares In
hospital life. There are others to be writ

Seeds. It is good to think upon the act of
the musician who gave up fila spring cot
to an unknown fellow sold'.er who was in
need: upon the work of the two RÂ»:d Cross

early weeks almost single-handed through

California. He had an acre of land at
home, and had been saving up to build a'
little house. And there was a girl waiting
for himâ a girl who still weeps over the
photograph of a dead soldier, whose grave
lies under the hot Manila sun.
A nurse whose mother was dependent
upon him fell 111. We had been good
friends and he asked to see me. I went
over to his -cot.
"Old man," he said, "it's all up. I'm
sure It's all' up! What will my mother
pray with htm. Z 414 ML Death earn* a
week later.
I do not remember that I had felt bit
terly because of suffering or had had any
cry ngalnst fortune whatsoever, until one
day the steward came Into the ward and,
stopping at my cot, said that I should go
thereafter to the kitchen for my meals;
that I was able, and that faking did not
work. It was too much, to suffer through
long weeks, to feel life slipping from me,
almost to lose hope of seeing the shores

I came to dread the hours when the
operations were being performed. I can
not say whether there was a dearth of
anaesthetics or whether the cases were
such- as to forbid their use. But there
were times when from the operating room
came the most hideous shrieks and the
most awful cursings I have ever heard.

wards, save one little pleasant-faced med
dler, whose bottles were always Oiled
with good milk. His steps were so soil
and his smile so sympathetic that they
came to be looked for as a pleasant fea
ture of the morning.
Why milk was not placed regularly n>
on the hospital fare I cannot conceiveâ
perhaps the Government was too poor.
There was in the Cavlte Hospital a lim
ited amount furnished for the use of fever
patients, but those stricken with diseases
of the bowels, although it was advls*d
by the surgeons, were not given any milk.
My own expense for milk, eggs and corn
starch, when, during the last week*. 1
could no longer endure the hospital food,
was approximately n SO per day. They
were prepared for me by a company com
rade, since there was no other means
provided.
From the navy yard hospital I was
transferred to that within the town of
Cavite, and from there, after runninr the
gamut of dysentery, fever and measles, I
was discharged and returned to my com
pany in Manila. But I was discharged
too soon. Three days I spent In company
headquarters and again they carried me
to the hospital. The weeks passed away
while I slowly weakened. I could no
longer rise from my cot, not even to alt
up. but lay watting with all possible pa
tience for the sailing of a ship. I had
been discharged after eight weeks In the
hospital as "totally disabled â chr v.lc dys
entery."
One morning I said good-by to the poor
fellows around me. Many of them are
sleeping the sleep that knows not waklnj.
Above their graves, melancholy but sweet,
the bugles have sounded tapsâ taps for an
eternal night.
At last I was on board a home-bound
ship. If ever the gates of Hades open to
the doomed spirits they will know the Joy
that was mine to escape the death-laden
odors of the hospital for the fresh salt
breezes of the Pacific. I knew that there
was only one chance m a thousand for me
to roach home alive. But I clung to the
one chance, and slowly health came back.

'him. Money and promises have been se
c cured. Greater than theseâ the trump
> card . which the society is preparing to
playâ is its new acquisition, an American
c citizen. Homer Lea has Joined hands
)wlth the Chinese revolutionists. Homer
cLea, well up in military affairs, claiming
\a military ancestry back through all
America's wars, is the masterpiece of
* conversion. The importance of gaining
) such a member is so great that the presi
dent at Macao is looking at the California
.achievement. Homer Lea will be reward
ed if he and the revolution are successful.
iHe will be a great man in China and
) there will be plums In the shape of diplo
matic positions falling in his path to be
'picked up.
' Meanwhile the local leaders feel that
ctheir success is now assuredâ now that an
) American military man is working with
them.
He Is a 21-year-old college student, who
'claims a wealthy father In Los Angeles,
tile says that his allowance for several
j years back has been $300 per month, which
is a neat little sum and which he rather
'regrets the loss of. For it so happened,
(according to his narrative, that he told
this father about three months ago of his
plans for being a warrior bold. The reply
was: "I will supply you with money to
attend college, but with none to start rev
olutionary wars." And the 1300 was cut
off.
This had no effect upon the young man's
determination. He went about his work
more stubbornly than ever, hobnobbing
with the Chinese, and becoming Intimate
with one of the leaders of the Los An
geles reform society. This man was Tom
Tsai Hin. a person shrewd enough in his
narrow-eyed fashion to appreciate the
value of the name of an American to
stand on his lists. Moreover, Homer Lea
would be valuable to attend to the actual
management from a military standpoint.
Proud to bursting on the strength of his
acquisition, Tom Tsal Hin had pictures
taken of Lea and himself grouped with
another member of the societyâ Chang
Kung Sing. Eight of these photographs
were sent to Honolulu, Yokohama, Naga
saki, Hongkong and Macao, and letters
went along explaining that one Homer
Lea, a student at Stanford University,
California, a man well up in military af
fairs, is in sympathy with the Pow Wong
Wuey and desires to operate the cam
paign from a military standpoint and to
bring it to a successful issue.
Tom Tsai Hin's next move was to put
Mr. Lea into action at once. He pro
vided him with important documents,
such as identification papers, letters of
introduction to the president and leaders
of San Francisco's society and, most val
uable of all. five letters to the most Im
portant leaders in the Orient. They were
addressed to Kang Yue Wei of Macao,
who goos by the alias of Hong Najn Hoi;
Leon Kei Chew, now in Honolulu; the
Gee Sun Po, a Chinese newspaper in Ma
cao; the members of the Tai Tung Hok
Hau Association of Yokohama, and to
Lee Yung Shue of Tuck Wing, Hongkong^
The fac simile given here of one of the
letters is of all, as they are identical.
They merely Introduce Mr. Homer Lea;
explain hl3 plans and dwell upon his an
cestry of warriors, which means much to
these Old World people.
Mr. Lea docs not speak their language,
so he had difficulty in finding the San
Francisco president of reformers when he
arrived here. Rev. Ng Poon Chew helped
him out. Ho is a reformer from Los An
geles, editor nowadays of a local Chinese
newspaper, the Chung Sal Vat Po.
When the president read Mr. Lea's let
ters and saw his photograph taken with
the Los Angeles leader, glad-hand was
no name for it. He trumpeted Lea's ar
rival among all his colleagues, and great
was the sensation. Dr. Tom Bhe Bin was
much elated and spread the news Joy
fully. He advertised to such good effect
that eight prominent reformers called
upon Lea and invited him to a banquet in
his honor at a swagger restaurant on
Jackson streetâ a restaurant where carved
stools take the place of chairs and where
the soup comes last.
Mr. Lea behaved prettily and the ban
quet took place on the night of March 15
last. Famous reformers were present and
Chinese custom' was infringed upon to the
extent of speech-making., Mr. Lea's part
of this was done through an interpreter.
Silently eager Chinese sat about and
heard Lea's propositions. He would start
a revolutionary war at either Hongkong

Bo lfs for your benefit that these pictures
were taken. They show four dainty
gowns, not too elaborate for the veran
das and leafy lanes, yet crisp as the
morning air and us cool looking as the
proverbial cucumber.
The gown worn in the first picture Is
an organdie of such fine texture that It
looks like a bit of a summer cloud. The
skirt Is tucked down below the knee In
dusters of four. Two rows of lace In
sertion and a lace ruffle finish the skirt.
The waist has a yoke finely tucked and
finished by a lace ruffle that droops low
over the tucked sleeves. Despite the
tucking, insertion and ruffles, this gown
Is simple and unpretentious. However,
like others of Its kind, it is not easily
made or cheaply purchased.
The waist in the next picture shows
how a different effect can be produced by
practically the same methods. This waist
is also tucked and finished with a ruffle,
but instead of the low shoulder effect the
yoke is' pointed. \i-- : r-
The skirt Is ruffled with the same ma
terial, finished in satin baby ribbon. One
of the ruffles is so arranged as to give
the effect of an oversklrt.
The material in the third picture Is very
new and pretty and is not as thin as or
gandie. A tiny, almost Invisible polka
dot runs through it, and the lace braid
used for trimming, combined with the
wide and narrow ribbon, makes this a

Lawton's Fatalism.
A Western orator recently attributed to
General Lawton the dying speech of
"Bucky" O'Neil of the Rough Riders, who
was struck in the mouth by a bullet at
Ean Juan just after he had remarked that
the bullet had not been made which could
tit him.
A brother officer of General Lawton In
the Philippines corrects this report In this
wise: "I had remarked, half Jestingly,
that he offered a very conspicuous target
for a bullet, and he laughed and replied
that the right bullet would always find
Its mark, no matter how email. Then he
related an Incident which occurred dur
ing the Civil War. In one of the engage

now whether or not he mentioned the

where a soldier was standing and scared
him so badly that he jumped straight na

So we returned to our Gibson and re
assured ourselves that he was the only
one who knew. But when the report
came that a radically new kind of Ameri
can girl had been chosen by a committee
of well-known artists, what were we go-
Ing to do about It?
Miss Adams, of course, is entirely
charming. Her nose is not afraid to run
the risk of a profile photograph and her
mouth Is very agreeable in a full face.
Her eyes are more sympathetic than
those of her predecessor. Shn shares a
bit of the other's reserve In the pois* of
the head. Another point in common !Â» tha
love for out of doors. I have been told
that Miss Adams plays golf as it should
be played. But. after all, thÂ« distance
between her and the girl before her U
the distance from pole to pole. And :.
looked like a yes or no question. If the
statue were called "An American Oirl,"
it might have been different. But "The!"
said report. Either Gibson or the com
mittee must be right, and if one was right
the other was wrong.
There is enough difference on the sur
face of things between the towering,
queenly maiden and the gllmpetng. fly
away Lady Babbie. Deeper than that lies
the temperamental difference. Majestic
serenity of face- on the one hand; lova
ble. Impetuous mischief on the other.
I did an unusual thing In that I pro
phesied. I said that this J157.000 goldea
girl would cause the rising of factions.
Now that St. Peter Peck bars Paris' gates
against the status, the factions may never
rise. At any rate, whichever girl is finally
settled upon Is much to be envied. Fur
ther, she 13 much to be pitied. For It Is a
good deal of a task to live up to the honor
bestowed upon her. To be called beautt
ful Is much, and to be called accomplished
is much also, but to be called the Ameri
can girlâ that is our greatest national
compliment. SARAH COMSTOCK.
something lacking. But we still told our
selves that she was one of us; that she
stood for our type. She charmed people
from over the sea. Anthony Hope wrote
of Gibson's drawings:
"It helps us to sympathize with Cupid's
triumphs when we look at the girls over
whom they are won. We perceive that
there Is something to conquer. For the
girl whom the artist gives us Is not a
ready prey to sentiment and does not
yield very easily. She is happy, healthy
and proud; there is a touch of austerity
and a hint of haughtiness In her maiden
ly air; she does not languish, though no
doubt she might sometimes flirt securely.
. . . We believe that the hard-won
victory will be complete and do not refuse
our consent when we are Invited to trust
to such a permanence of it as will resist
the lapse of years and the decay of
beauty."
The attempts made by various artists,
single handed, to revolutionize the Ameri
can girl were for the most part flat fail
ures. Their attempts had none of the
charm of Mr. qibson's girl, hence we did
not choose to believe In them. Howard
Chandler Christy waa more convincing
than the rest, perhaps, and his "Helen
Cabot" of Davis' story had her fad. But
It was no serious menace to Gibson. To
the careless observer Mr. Christy's type
was a less vigorous creation aleng the
same line as Gibson's. To those who
looked again the innovation was removed
from the original as Boston Is from New
York, and they said this was not a move
toward truer Americanism. She seemed
to feel the thumb of some Puritan ances
tor upon her. She was aristocratic, beau-
that we liked to pretend we had prodnoed
thÂ« type for him.
We l'.ked the splendid physique he gave
her. It might have been trained Into what
it was hy long, wind-facing prairie rides
or by measured pulls against a challeng
ing current or by mountain climbing, with
thÂ« Joy of mountain air filling strong
young lungs.
We liked the way her pr-ood head held
itself. In her carriage we read "born to
the purple." Her hands said the samÂ«
thing. They were large, as befitted her,
but they were slender, with the tapering
fingers of aristocracy and the narrow,
curving nails. I am looking at Gibson's
'"Wireless Telegraphy" now, and I see her
foot. It is the first time I ever caught a
peep of It. and it is quite what I ex
pected. Not small, any more than the
hand; but look at the arch of that Instep!
We liked the brain-boding forehead that
Mr. Gibson bestowed upon her. We lik<Â«d
the chin for its determination and the
lips for their sweetness. We liked the way
he pinched her eyes at the outer corner
for the ?ake of perception and humor,
which are of ore Wood, anyway.
In the ballroom she carried everything
before her. We know that she was an.
ideal dnncer and she could play golf, too,
and ride a wheel, and tramp a deck's
length laughing at the biggest waves.
We vcere delighted with her. More than
that, we were satisfied. We would not
admit that she was Ideally unreal, for
did she not do very human things? Flirt
a bit at summer resorts and gown herself
w!th much thought of the prevailing
styles? No one whom we met was quite
the Gibson girl, to be cure; In those who
approached nearest there was always

for use in places where there are no elec

storage battery of high voltage and light

is cheap to construct and weighs only
thirty-five pounds, or much less than the

Mr. Patterson also produces at his en
tertainments an electrical storm, which
begins with distant summer lightning, and
gradually increases in violence until chain

by its realistic vividness. The lightning
flashes are accompanied by thunder and
rain, which are produced by an iron thun

the manner familiar to the thaumatur

soft sighs and gentle rustles, but rises

Ingenious contrivances for utilizing the

W. Patterson, w^io for the past six or
eeven years has been giving entertaln
rnT.ts In the halls, lodgerocm* and Toung
Men's Christian Associations cf Chicago.
The curioci and complicated circles of
light ehown la tbe accompanying pictures
are produced by ewiiigirg a pair of Indian
clubs lighted electrically. Each club Is
xraÂ£e In two parts (the split being down
Its length), ar-d a flexible cable of five
â¢wires is led Into the handle through a rub
ber tube, the wires being quite concealed.
Three rows cf eight miniature colored
lamps ef threÂ« candle-power are set in
small brass sockets along the club, so
that the lamps stand out at right angles
to the length of the club. Thus the two
clubs have six rows of vart-colored lamps,
with which many beautiful combinations
can be made. At the tip of each club lsÂ»
fixed a thirty-two candle-power fifty-volt
lamp, which Is generally run on 110 volts
and gives out a light so dazzling that the
eye could not look at it if it were sta
tionary. Inside 'the club are switches,
which are controlled by a concealed oper
ator.
The dub-swinging, of course, is done in
a dark room. The photographs not only
show how complex are the figures traced
by the lights, but also give a good idea
of the dexterity of the performer, who
ewir.gs the clubs so accurately that the
circles appear es true as if drawn by a
pair of compasses. The five-lincl circles
ere marie by the revolutions of the minia
ture lamps, and the broad bands are pro
duced by the thirty-two candle-power
globes at the tips of the clubs. The pho

lamps, the clubs being swung at an or
dinary rate of speed.

Then he hunted for an envelope in his
pocket and moved to the light bo that he
could Jot down something on its back. It
was the song that clever Carroll Johnson
is rejcicir.g in around at the Columbia.
As coon as it was written Lee sent it to
him, then on his way West, and Carroll's
response came: "I won't do a thine to
that song."
He has been a long: time at It, this mak

we call It, though he Is sure ho does not
make them. They Just come Into h!s head

ciated with them. But a wingless
'.bird will come as a shock to most people,
Uor everybody regards thÂ© poeeesslon of
:wlngs and the power of flight as thÂ©
strongest characteristics of the feathered
.bipeds we call "birds." Yet in thÂ© beau
tiful country of New Zealand there still
(exist several cpedee of wingless birds and
: others becaiaÂ© extinct there not more
than a century or two ago.
The gigantic dlnornls, or "terrible
â¢bird," was once very numerous In New
!s>aland, where he ranged on thÂ© plains
<smd hillsides. He was ten or eleven feet
Aigh and was akin to the Australian emu
-or cassowary and to the African ostrich.
JThese remarkable birds arÂ© all dlstln
iÃUlshed by the extremely rudimentary
tjiature of their wings, which ere useless
rither for flight or defense, and by tha
.fact that tht-ir feathers are scanty on
Â¦the neck and breast, but of great length
Â«t the back. Their legs are stout, and
the inner toe is armed with a long, sharp
â¢uid powerful claw, with which a danger
ous blow can be struck.
The cassowary, when captured young,
becomes tame and domesticated, but thÂ©
bird which has grown up wild is diffi
cult to approach, and is so strong and
swift that it is very rarely caught. It
eats voraciously, and. like Its kinsman
the ostrich, will swallow anything that
Jt can get within its beak. Tha South
Americaiv rhea is of the same family
and posstSses very similar characteristics.
Though the dlnorals, or "mot," as it
Is generally termed, has become extinct
In New Zealand, there axe several dimin
utive representatives of the genus to
Â¦which it belongs. The kiwi and the
Â¦weka, or wood hen, are birds of the moa
kind; that is, they are "apterygee," or
â¢wingless. The first known specimen of
the kiwi was brought from South New
Zealand to Great Britain by the captain
of the chip Providence, and was pre
rented to an English ornUholorlst named
Shaw. When 6haw died it Uecaxne the
property of LÂ«ord Stanley (afterward the
thirteenth Earl cf Derb7) and was be
queathed by him to the British Museum.
3n 1844 the British Museum had three
specimens, one of which, two years later,
was Bent to the Academy of Natural Sci
ence at Philadelphia. In 1847 another
species of the same genus was found and
Â¦was named Apertyx Owenl, out of com
pliment to the distinguished naturalist.
Professor Owen. Another species received
the name Apteryx Mantelll. These speci
mens, however, were all dead ones. ThÂ©
Crst kiwi that ever reached England alive
â¢was presented by Mr. Eyre, then Lieu
tenant Governor of New Zealand. An
other species ia named Apteryx Haaetli,
from a well-known naturalist. V#n Haast.
Kiwis are of a reddish dark-brown color,
rtriped with light They
sleep or are inactive in the daytime, but
Jn thÂ© twilight they run about In a very
.'quiet *nd cautious mariner. Their lack

of fact. Indeed, thÂ© same "ocydroms,'*
or swift-runner, has been given tÂ» mo*
spoclea. When they run they take loaj
strides, with the neck Btretched oat and
thÂ© body leanlngr forward. When a kiwi
is disturbed In thÂ© daytime hÂ» yawns la
a moat amusingly bored manner.
If provoked the bird raises Itself vy. aad
pulling up ono leg, strikes down qulokly
and with considerable foreÂ© with Its
strong, sharp claw. Its sense of touch Is
highly developed, for while searching- for
the earth worms which form Its principal
food It pokes at everything with thÂ© point
of its bill, and when It is shut up la a
carÂ© it taps thÂ© bars gently all through
thÂ© night. In foraging for worm* It
strikes its beak into the ground and
draws thÂ© worm out very gently and care
fully. When It has It quitÂ© out It throws
up its head and gulps it down whole.
ThÂ© kiwis are the most interesting
group of birds now in existence, and
though specimens will probably bÂ© pro

the wild ones are almost certainly doomed
to extinction. The Maoris of New Zea
land make a good deal of use of thÂ© kiwi.

into leather and weaving the feathers into
robes. The flesh, however, may suit a
Maori's taste, but no white men IlkÂ© it.
for It Is tough and has very little taste.
ThÂ© Maoris catch the birds with dogs,
which start them and then pursuÂ© them
by scent until a swamp is reached, whexÂ©
the kiwi tries to bury Itself in the mud
and Is caught. Another method of cap
ture is to light a fire in a wood wherÂ©
kiwis arÂ« plentiful. The hunter thÂ«n
Imitates the bird's cry and so lures them
up to thÂ© fire, the glare of which, stupe
fies them, so that they can be easily
seized.
Another very queer bird Is thÂ© weka,
which is called the kiwi's friend, ftom the
fact that he i-J often In his company. ThÂ©
wekaN Is a rail, of about the size of a
pheasant and of a dark brown color, with
red eyes, no wings and a very short tall.
It. like the kiwi, is extraordinarily Inquis

clever in its movements that it avoids
many of the dangers into which Its eager
desire to acquire information often leads
It. Of so Inquiring a disposition Is It that
It will enter a traveler's tent and steal his
pots and pans before thÂ© very eyes of

wekas to comÂ© out from tho surrounding

Sometimes a jack would fly up to the
perch and give one of the tawnles a
friendly dig .with his beak, for all the
world as though he wanted to say, "Wake
up, old fellow!" Whereupon the owl
would proceed with great gravity to comb
the disturber's plumage with beak and
claw, occasionally pausing during the
operation, and surveying his work with
half open eye," jack the while winking at
his mates below with an air of "It's all
right; it pleases the old buffer."
Barn owls also I have kept at different
times, and found them very amusing pets,
My first I got from a barn where for sev
eral years a pair had nested in an old
pigeon cote. Jeff we called him, and a
funny looking object he was when first
his education was begun.
Of course, most of my readers will be
aware of the fact that feathers or fur and

other hand. I have found remains for the
most part of birds, such as thrushe'a and
chaffinches, though this .species is capable
of coping with a good sized rat.
But of all the owls which I have at dif
ferent times kept, none, not even Darby,
ever came up to a pair of horned or long
eared owls, which no visitor to my recol
lection ever cast eyes on without being
filled with the desire of possessing them.
One I took myself from an old sparrow
hawk's nest In a Scotch fir; the other was
procured for me when scarcely three days
old, and was brought up In company with
a pair of young kestrels. As soon as they
were able to use their wings I transferred
them from the nursery in my room to tho

and would often fly right down in antici
pation of a meal.
One day. owing to a mlstake.on tha part
of a boy whom I had left in charge of my
pets, they were left out. not only all day,
but all night also. As I had anticipated,
during the night time, finding no ona to
feed them, they foraged for themselves,
presumably with considerable success, for
next day when I went round calling for
them they must have been sleeping ~of2
their unwonted midnight meal, for I re
ceived no answer, and. In fact, never
again beheld them.
I will conclude with a brief word of ad
vice to any one wishing to try the experi
ment of owl keeping for himself. You
can scarcely take an owlet too younÂ«
KONG thÂ«Â» many bird pets which I
1 have kept at different times owls
/* â *\ have always been my favorites.

I have always found that most interest at
taches to those pets which we manage to
secure for ourselves, and certainly of all
the birds which I have at different times
kept those which have cost me the long
est walk and hardest climb have gener
ally been my favorites. Consequently my
one ambition for a long while was to find
an owl's nest for myself.
For many years, even at the time when
I could pick out the most cunningly hid
den nest of the blackcap, or garden war
bler, and tell exactly what corner of the
wood in which to search for the tiny wood
wren, I should have considered the find
ing of an owl's nest as a feat far beyond
me. partly for the reason that I had only
a limited idea of owls at home, that b^ing
in connection with hollow trees, of which
there was a plentiful lack about our
northern county, or of ruined castles and
towers, of which there was an absolute
dearth.
The fact also of the owl being still to me

News had been brought me that an owl
had been seen to fly from a certain tree
In a wood hard by. Straightway I started
off with a fellow, naturalist to search for
the nest. The first day, owing to want of
time, we were unsuccessful, but on the
next, upon our going once again to the
spot, up flew the old bird, and there upon
the branch of the very tree to which we
had been directed we. beheld two fluffy
little owls just out of the m st, which, ow
ing to its having been in an old sa.ulrrel'3
drey about a hundred yards from the spot,
we had failed to find the day before. .Both
birds were secured without much trouble,
my friend taking one and I the other.
Darby, as we called him, certainly had
the makings of a fine owl, a"nd I laid my
self out to develop his good qualities. He
was kept in a roomy cage, and occasion
ally allowed to pass. the night In an ad-
Joining cellar. He soon learned to hop ori
to his master's arm for his food, and be
fore long became as playful as any kit
ten. His favorite game consisted in play-
Ing with a small feather brush. When
Hurrying up. there at the bottom of a
large earthenware jar I found him float
ing In a ftiot.^and a. half of water, with
nothing but his great head showing above
the surface, the feathers around his neck
seeming to support him like a bu#y. He
had tried to get at the water in the jar
and had succeeded only too well. He must
have been in several hours, for when
pulled out he lay upon ray hand with
hardly a sigh of life, looking like' a bunch
of wet feathers, the most" pitiful object 1
ever cast my eyes upon.
Much ?.s I should like to narrate in detail
for the instruction of my readers the story
of his illness and how. after lingering be
tween life and death for a whole week, he
linally recovered, I must content myself
with stating that recover he did, owing â i
say it with some prideâ to the medical
treatment 10 which I subjected him. â¢
I was not destined to keep my pet long,
however. One day while I was feeding
him he took It into his head to fly to the
very top of a high tree close at hand. I
left his cage open, fully expecting him to

ficirsg more than to repel the attack made
on his advance posts.

LONDON. April 22.â Spenser Wilkinson,
reviewing the situation !n South Africa
for the Associated Press, says at mid
night:
"The Boer* admirably understand how
to suit thrJr tactics and strategy to the
country. Their art consists in compelling
the Eritish to attnek nnd make exhaust

with roads. Thus their first step is to
6urround in superior force any isolated
party of British. This compels the Brit
ish, if they try to escape^ to attack under
conditions which give all the advantages
of cover and defensive use of rifle fire to
the Borr force. The British commander
In chief Is then forced to send a relief ex
pedition from a distance. The Boer force
Interposes and the British, in order to get
forward^ are again compelled to attack.

Johnson, Democratic committeeman for
Kansas and vice chairman of the Demo
cratic National Executive Committee, to
day in response to a telegram from the
New York Journal, propounding five ques
tions relating to the coming campaign,
telegraphed that paper as follows:
Question 1-On what Issues will the Demo
crats go Into the fight for President?
Answerâ Denunciation of the money trust,
with its policy of currency contraction tiy.the
retirement of greenbacks and the establishment
of the cold standard; denunciation of the Re
publican abandonment of the republic and the
inauguration of the empire, with colonialism
and militarism and carpetbagism and world al
liances rampant: denunciation of commercial
and industrial trusts and monopolies, the out
growth of McKrhley tariffs and the fester chil
dren of McKlnleylsm. past, present and future;
for tariff revision and Democratic officials to
crush the trusts; demand for Income tax. that
he who has may share the Governmental bur
dens with he who must have; and demand that
Interstate corporation employes be protected by
national legislation from coercion, blacklisting
and kindred outrages.

Answerâ The answer to the first question an
swers this.
Question 3â lf Dewey runs as an Independent
candidate for President, what effect will his

VICTORY FOR POOLSELLERS.
J. H. Davis Is Acquitted by a Jury
in Yolo County. ,s ;
Special DlsDatch to the Call. -\~
WOODLAND. April 21.â A Jury acquit
ted J. H. Davis In less than five minutes
to-day of the charge of violating the anti
pool selling ordinance. This was a Wash
ington case and Davis Is one of the pool
sellers who was driven out of Sacramento
and who located on the Yolo side of the
river. The' prosecution did not make a
strong case. It was not shown that there
was a race on the day the prosecuting
witnesses bought a pool. The jockeys sub
penaed for that purpose did not appear
and Judge Ruggles refused to grant a
further continuance or to issue an attach
ment for the defaulting witnesses. The
defense also attacked the validity of the
ordinance, but it is understood that the
failure to prove that there was a race
was the principal reason for acquittal. It
Is probable that the Supervisors will de
cide to re-enact the ordinance. The pool
sellers have gained a substantial victory.
Before the new ordinance will be operative
the season will be over.

Though the Cabinet Appears

General Clamor for the Re
call of Buller and "Warren.
Copyrighted, 1900, by the Associated Press.
LONDON. April 21.â The British Governor of Ashantl. Sir Frederick M. Hodg
son, stands in danger of being murdered and his rule swept out of re
membrance, the United Stater, is generally considered on the brink of war
with Turkey, the Paris Exposition has opened. Queen Victoria is return
ing from her remarkable visit to Irelandâ yet "who cares?" In England
there is only one topic, and that is Lord Roberts' Spion Kop censures and their
possible results. Even the commencement of the advance against Pretoria fails
to detract interest from the all-absorbing sensation of the hour. The weeklies
teem with comment that defies a cabled synopsis. While there Is multitudinous
expression of opinion regarding the advisability of the publication at the present
moment of such terrible indictments of British generals and officers and while
the authorities differ widely as to the causes of their inefficiencies and the reme
dies therefor, one common verdict seems to have been reached, which Is that Spion
Kop was a terrible muddle and that some one must be brought to book.
Though the Cabinet itself appears scarcely decided upon what course to pur.
sue, public opinion is pretty clearly defined and is unanimous in demanding the
recall of General Buller and General Warren. Placing Colonel Crofton on half
pay has merely whetted the national appetite and the ravenous demand for ac
tion and for the prevention of the useless los 3 of loved ones cannot be satisfies
with such a meager bone as Crofton. Higher heads, it seems, must fall.
It is probable the Government hopes General Buller will apply for his own
recall, but this seems unlikely to happen, and now the country' angrily waits
for the action that all sections of the press declare must follow the extraordinary
timid publication of Roberts' strictures. A curious feature is that Lord Robert?
apparently 13 not empowered to deal with General Buller or even General War
ren, both having been directly appointed by the Government, and beyond report
ing Lord Roberts is unable to take action. Yet for six weeks after receiving
Lord Roberts' report the Marquis of Lansdowne, the Secretary of State for War.
left the question open and now for som.; mysterious reason has taken the public
into his confidence. Hence Lord Roberts is naturally freed from all blame
and has increased his popularity by being brave enough to expose weak spots
The polite warning of the British High Commissioner in South Africa. Sir
Alfred Milner, that English ladles are not needed at Cape Town, forms the basis
of a scathing article In the Saturday Review, which says:
"It is barely a year ago that the English press teemed with comments far
from complimentary on the extravagant outbursts of New York society over the
apotheosis of Dewey and his sailors. But the harm effected by that ridiculous
spectacle was limited to its personal results. There was no interference with
military -operations and the policy of the United States was In no way hampered
because certain young ladles made themselves and their victims laughing stocks
Though, morally, the fruit of this same sickly sentimentaliszn and love of no
toriety, .this descent of English society on the shores of South Africa is far
worse. .Thl3 rush to the front is only a repulsive exhibition of a general out
burst of unhealthy sentimentallsm. for which the war has afforded the oppor
tunity. This sickly exotic, matured by the Kiplingism of the music halls and
cherished by idle hands, bids fair to obscure its vigorous, sturdy brother, which
is spreading Us roots throughout the empire."
Â¦ The Saturday Review goes on to say that If the women do not take Sir
Alfred Mllner's hint the world will know what to think of them.
HOSTILITIES RENEWED AT ALL POINTS
IN THE FIELD OF SOUTH AFRICAN WAR
Most Important of All
Operations Is March
of Third and Eighth
Divisions to the Relief
of Wepener.
Boers Continue to Attack the
Position Held by the British
North of Glens â Carrington's
Long March to the Rescue of
Beleaguered Mafeking.
Special Cable to Tlie Call and New York Herald. Copyrighted, 1900, by
the New York Herald Company.
LONDON. April 22.â A renewal of hostilities at almost every point In the
field of war is indicated by the latest reports. Most Important of all op
erations is the march of the Third and Eighth divisions to raise the siege
of Wepener. Lord Roberta reports fighting between Rundle's men and the
Bce-rs southwest of Dewetsdorp Friday and yesterday. Accounts of the en
gragement or skirmishes vary somewhat, but according to what seems most
?rust-worthy the enemy have persistently disputed the British advance, but have
been gradually driven back.
From Maseru comes word that the Boers up to Thursday were still freely mov
ing around Wepener. The British were apparently expecting the arrival of re
lief columns. The burghers received reinforcements, and it is stated that Presi
dent Stern has ordered them to hold on tightly to the districts of Wepener.
Ladvbraiid and Picksburg. and at all costs to prevent the British forces from
obtaining the rich food supplies of those districts.
Evidently the Boers continue to attack the position held by the British in
famry and artillery north of Glens. The lighting has not, however, developed yet
hryoiid skirmishing or sniping-. A cavalry force is in readiness to act should ne
cessity arise for greater activity in meeting the enemy's operations. Some cor
responflpnts assert that General Duller is making preparations to co-operate
â¢wi;h Boberts in a grand advance, but it looks as if the Natal commander had a
heavy task nn hand to be able to give aid to his chief. One critic who knows the
country well says it must be remembered that although the Boers were forced to
retreat from Ladysmith they are still in large force in the corner <\f Natal, and it
Â¦would I" 1 a risky thing for General Buller to move as far to the west as Van Ree
nans Pass into "the Free State except with a force so small a.s to he of little ser
vice. This is because of the danger of a sudden attack on the British commu
nications south to Pietermaritzburg. Such a movement would almost invite an
attack.
Consequently it is most likely that we shall see General Buller devoting his
b^st energies for the next few days or longer to operations designed to clear
Northern Natal of the Boers as far as Laings Nek. When this is accomplished
It may be considered safe to move one division back to Van Reenans Pass, ready
to march into the Free State as soon as the defenders of the pass find their po
sition rendered untenable by Lord Roberts' advance.
A part of Lord Methuen's force was fiercely attacked near Boshof on Friday
by a strong body of Boer? with two suns. The enemy were held in-check, how
evÂ« r. and a large convoy which the column was protecting was brought safely
through.
Everybody here seems to be on the qul rive, expecting the speedy relief of
Mafeking, inasmuch as General Carrington is now on his way south from Beira.
Borne of the military critics are not at all sure that hi 3 expedition Is making
for Mafeklng. In any event, it is worth remembering that Carrington's force
Â¦Rill hardly be ready to leave Salisbury before May 1 at the earliest. There will
then be nearly SOO miles of open country to be traversed before Buluwayo, the
terminus of the railroad to Mafeking. ts reached. Even the mobile force under
Carrington is hardly likely to cover this distance in less than a fortnight, as it
Is essential that the horses should be spared as much as possible in order to keep
them in pood rendition for the severe task still before them.
Th.< will bring his force to Buluwayo hy May IZ. He will then have the as
sistance of the railway, which will enable him to expidite his movements some
what. But even this advantage will hardly allow him to transport a force of 5000
men. with horses and baggage and provisions for the beleaguered town, over 400 odd
mi'.es. in less than ten or twelve days. At the end of the railway available
seventy-eight miles will have to be traversed on horses, and probably an action
fought, before General Carrington can hope to shake the hands of Baden-PowelL
When all these thir.gs are considered one cannot feel sanguine about Mafekin*
being relieved before Juneâ that is if Mafeklng really depends upon Carrington.

MASERU, Basutoland. April 21.â The
Boers around Wepener have been rein

The firing of cannon and rifles was heard
to-day in the direction of Dewetsdorp,
which was looked upon as meaning that
relief' was approaching. Heavy fighting
Is hourly expected. Two large forces left
the vicinity of Wepener this morning, one
going in the direction of Dewetsdorp and
the other toward Rouxvllle. The Boers
are excited and jubilant in consequence of
President Stein's assertion that foreign in

BOSHOF, Orange Free State, April 21.â
At midday yesterday General Methuen's
field force at Swarzkopfonteln was or
dered to return to Boshof. Its convoy ex
tended over six miles. The escort took up
a position on a hill commanding the road
just In the nick of time, as a force of 2000
Boers with two guns and a pompom sud
denly appeared in the vicinity and opened
a very heavy fire. The British, however,
held them in check until the column
reached a place of safety, when they re
tired. The British had several casualties.
The Boers fought determinedly and must
have suffered considerably, as they once
advanced to within 100 yards of the hill;
whence a Â¦ concealed detachment of the
British opened a heavy fusillade on them.

RICH FIND IN ATLIN.
Miner Unearths a Pocket of Almost
Pure Gold.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C.. April 21.â J. H.
Brownlee, a provincial surveyor who ar
rived here from Atlin, says a very rich
Ind of free gold has been made'in a cav
2rn.on Spruce Creek In the Atlln district.
This . find Is a mystery. The discoverer
was drifting to reach the supposed old
channel of Spruce for a grub stakeâ that
is, to rock out enough "'gold to buy pork,
Deans, tobacco, etc. He was rewarded by
3trlklng a pocket of gold, out of which he
tiad taken more than a pound, which sells
for $15 to $17 an ounce, when Mr. Brown
lee left. Mr. Brownlee is making an ex
perimental 1 shipment 1 of this rich stuff to
New York, believing It will be in demand
for jewelry. The admixture of rose quartz
with filigree gold produces a very hand
some effect and much more chaste jew
elry than the more vulgar placer nuggets.
This winter it has been proved that a
ledge of free milling quartz extends above
and below discovery on Pine, and It has
been stripped for 700 or 800 feet, and in
places the locators have sunk to a depth
of thirty-five ~feet. In no place Is the
ledge narrower than eighteen Inches, car
rying gold values as high as $700 or $SOO to
the ton. .
LONDON, April 2!.â The War Office has received the following dispatch
from Lord Roberts:
*'BLOEMFONTEIN, April 21.â Bundle's force came in contact
with the enemy yesterday four miles southwest of Dewetsdorp. They
occupied strong positions.,covering the town. The Yeomanry and Mounted
Infantry seized another position, which enabled Rundle to-drive the en
emy off and occupy the high ground the enemy had been holding.
"Rundle advanced this morning early and is now again engaging the
enemy. . Our casualties yesterday were two men severely wounded and
Lieutenant O'Connor and seven men slightly wounded."

PA RIB. April 21.â Though work goes on
incessantly night and day the installation
r-f exhibits at France's colossal exposition
is still greatly retarded. The gates are
closed to visitors at 6 o'clock in the even
ing, when freight cars and wagons loaded
with exhibits are allowed to enter the
grounds, and from that time on the exhi
bition resembles a vast workshop, with its
clanging hammers and swarms of French
workmen busily engaged on the comple.
tion of the interior of the buildings ana
in arranging the exhibits. Even during
visiting hours the work inside the palaces
goos steadily forward.
The immense crowd present on the open
ing two daysâ Easter Sunday and Monday
â has now dropped to about half the
number, but the exposition authorities de
clare themselves thoroughly satisfied, as
the figures still exceed those of the open
ing <ia>s of the exposition of lfc.SH. The ay
tendance now averages about 10;>.000 dally,
about one-half of whom pay for admis
sion.
The emptiness of the real exhibition
buildings has been a source of increased
revenue to the numberless "midway"
shows. The managers of many were
smart enough to have their spectacles
ready last Sunday and are already reap
ing a satisfactory harvest. Many of these
side shows are exceptionally attractive
and realistically mounted, such as the
Swiss village, which exhibition is an edu
cation in itself. The colonial section Is
especially fruitful In those lively place*
of amusement in which the Oriental
dances are even more risque than the now
famous danse dv ventre.
Whatever may be the name eventually
given to this side of the exposition, it will
undoubtediy prove as great an attraction
as the similar quarter known as the "Mid
way" at Chicago, judging from its popu
larity up to this time.'.
The rolling sidewalk, copied from the
original of the Chicago World's Fair,
promises to be a great feature, taking the
place of the Eiffel tQwer of ISB9. It Is
crowded all day long 'by Parisians, who
regard it as much as a source of amuse
ment as a means of locomotion.
President Loubet next week will begin

HOPES TO SEE
TURKEY'S SICK
MAN HUMBLED
England in Hearty Accord
With the Action of
America.
Belief That the Sultan Will Be Ad
vised by Emperor William to
Pay TTncle Sam's
Copyrighted, 1900, by the Associated Press.
LONDON, April 21.â Tlte Rev. T. De-
Witt Talmage preaches his first sermon
this year in England to-morrow at Man
chester. He is looking forward with keen
interest to addressing crowds of similar
enormous proportions to those who heard
him when he last visited England. The
well-known preacher is taking much in
terest in the India famine fund and the
distribution of American relief.
Sir William Wedderburn, known as an
authority on Indian affairs, writing to the
Speaker on the subject of the famine,
declares the British Government is re
sponsible to a great degree for the awful
sufferings, owing to unfair taxation and
the revolutionary systems of business
methods arbitrarily imposed on the na
tives.
Inquiries made by the Associated Press
regarding the attitude of Great Britain
and other powers toward the American-
Turkish ditticulty reveals the fact that no
one has x the slightest Intention of inter
ferine in any way. The British Govern
ment officials do not disguise their delight
at the stand taken by Washington and
hope the Sultan's obstinacy will for once
fail to achieve its ends. Great Britain
herself during past years has had much
trouble in exacting payment of debts from
the "sick man of the east" and appre
ciates the irritation displayed at Wash
ington. The British Embassador at Con
stantinople has informed the Foreign
Ottice of the condition existing, but mere
ly verifying what has already been pub
lished. So far Lord Salisbury has sent
him no instructions, but the Associated
Press is officially informed that Great
Britain and the other powers which ar-;
now making joint representations regard
ing the increase in the Turkish tariffs
have no Intention of pooling their issues
upon the American claims or in any way
associating the tariff matter with that
dispute.
Work in Sight for Dewey.
The possibility of serious results at
tracts general interest and much comment
in England. The Spectator says:
"It is earnestly to be desired that
Pharaoh should harden his heart. But
there is little chance of such an ad
vantage to the world. The Sultan wili
doubtless pay the money. If he does not
Dewey may go afloat again to do work
rather less easy and much more important
than the capture of Manila."
The Outlook suggests . that the United
States might take the customs of Smyrna
as a guarantee, but inclines to believe that
the Sultan's new friend, Emperor Wil
liam, will whisper "pay" and the incident
will be ended.
The Croton (N. V.) strike calls forth
many expressions of opinion. The Speaker
deals with it lengthily as perhaps the tlrst
outbreak of the long-predicted war be
tween labor and capital the world over
and says it believes the United States
will eventually be compelled to adopt
more severe restrictions on immigration
and strengthen its available forces for the
"Immediate suppression of incipient insur
rections," adding:
"America, to remain as she Is, must
cease to be the refuge of destitute man
kind."
The same paper, dealing with the pro
posed amendment to the constitution pro
viding for the election of Senators by pop
ular vote, declares that the "Senate now
swarms with millionaires who are be
lieved to purchase their election by large
gifts to campaign funds and who make it
nearly impossible for the President to
have a foreign policy," adding:
"The Hay-Pauncefote treaty, for exam
ple, was blocked not because its provis
ions were disliked, but because It might
help McKinley's candidacy. The people
are growing weary of this and the vote of

MRS. LESLIE CARTER IN TWO SCENES IN THE PLAY OF ZAZA."
The "Zaza" in question was rewritten
from the French play of the same name,
which was produced season before last
at the Paris Vaudevilles with Rejane in
the title role. As played by her the play
was undeniably Immoral and not one of
the American managers who had seen it
believed that it could be so transtormud
as to make it suitable for presentation
in this country.
David Belasco, after peeing the play, de
cided that it would bear a free adaptation
and that Mrs. Leslie Carter, his own
pupil, was better qualified to play the part
than any woman in America. His "Zaza"
was written. for Mrs. Carter and its firs:
production in New York justified to the
fullest degree his confidence in her ability
and his estimate of her power.
"Zaza" is the story of a cocotte and a
cad. It is the history of their illicit love.
It is the stage picture of the witching and
wooing of a married man by a little, red
headed, roughy-tough cafe chan'ant
singer of most exciting manners and no
morals at all. and, as Mrs. Carter saysâ
a great, passionate, loving, loyal, heart.
It is the picture of their union, their
housekeeping, their little affair.Applications for Citizenship.
Special Dispatch to The Call
OMAHA, Nebr., April 21.â The last two
weeks has brought to the office of the
District Clerk an unusually large number
of applications for citizenship. One ex
planation is that the applicants have be
come deeply interested in the politics of
Uncle Sam's domain and that they pro
pose to take a hand in voting. In this
connection it has developed that there is
to be a large exit for Europe from this
city^within the next few months, the
Paris Exposition being the attraction.
The force in the office of the District
Clerk, several members of which have
had long experience there, declare that
never before within their knowledge of
Courthouse affairs has there been such an
influx of thrifty foreigners in quest of
citizenship.
Advance in Wages.
CLEVELAND. April 21.â A schedule of

At the conclusion of this address Gen
eral Harrison introduced Rev. Judson
Smith of Boston, who delivered the ad
dress of welcome. He told of the growth
Ignorance and prejudice. They have been the
pioneers of civilization. They have illumined
the darkness of Idolatry and superstition with
the light of Intelligence and truth. They have
been messengers of righteousness and love.
They have braved disease and danger and
death and in their exile have suffered unspeak
able hardships, but their noble spirits have
never wavered. Tney count their labor no
sacrifice. "Away with the word In such a view
and with such a thought," says David Living
ston; It is emphatically no sacrifice; say rather
It Is a privilege. They furnish us examples of
forbearance and fortitude, of patience and un
yielding purpose and of a spirit which triumphs
not by the force of might, but by the majesty
of right. They are placing In the hands of
their brothers less fortunate than themselves
the keys which unlock the treasures of knowl
edge and open thÂ» mind to noble aspirations
for better conditions. Education Is one of the
Indispensable steps of mission enterprise and
In some form must precede all successful work.
The labors of missionaries, always difficult
and trying, are no longer so perilous as In
former times. In some quarters Indifference
and opposition have given place to aid and
co-operation. A hundred years ago many of
the fields were closed to missionaries. Now
almost everywhere is the open door, and only
the map of the world now marks the extent
of their thought and action.
Who can estimate their value to the progress
of the natlor.s? Their contribution to the out
ward and upward march of humanity Is beyond
all calculation. They have Inculcated Indus
try and taught the various trade 3. They have
promoted concord and amity and brought na
tions closer together. They have made men
better. They have Increased the regard for
home, have strengthened the sacred ties of
family, have made the community well ordered
and their work has been a potent influence in
the development ot law and the establishment
of government.
May this great meetlne rekindle the spirit of
missionary ardcr and enthusiasm "to g-o
teach all nations": may the flelrl never lack
"a succession of heralds who shall carry on
the taskâ the continuous proclamation of His
gospel to the end of time."
The President read his address. His
reference to ex-President Harrison as one
of the greatest statesmen of the United
States was applauded.
Governor Roosevelt made a brief address
and received an ovation. General Harri
son then spnke a few words, thanking
President McKinley and Governor Roose
velt for coming to the opening of the con
ference, and this was followed by the
benediction, pronounced by Dr. Judson
Smith. The President, the Governor and
General Harrison remained on the plat
form for a short time and met many of
the delegates. :,Â¦ â¢
OWENS REFUSES TO
TALK TO RELATIVES
Murderer of Daniel Wilson Is Sullen
and Indifferent as to His
Fate.
SUISUN, April 21.â There have been no
further developments in the- Wilson case.
Since making hl3 confession Owens has
been sullen and is apparently indifferent
as to the future. He Bald to-day that he
intended to tell the story of the crime at
the time he was arrested, but was too ex
cited.
Owens still contends that no one but
himself waa Implicated in the crimn. He
to-day sent the only money he had left â
two dollarsâ to his daughter In Healds
burg. Owens was arraigned this morn
ing before Justice Hitchcock on tha
charge of having murdered Dan H. Wil
son. The court instructed him as to his
privileges. He did not express himself aÂ»
being desirous of engaging the services of
a lawyer. Justice Hitchcock set next
Wednesday as the date for the prelim
inary examination and summons were at
or.Ce issued for the principal witnesses.
Owens refuses to see any one excepting
the officials. He refused last evening to
talk to some relatives who visited him.
District Attorney Devlin, who has worked
assiduously to bring about the arrest of
the actual murderer, said to-day that
there was a complete chain of evidence
against Owens, which would have resulted
in conviction even if Owens had not made
a confession.

received from her since her husband's ar

MEN OF MANY CREEDS AT
THE ECUMENICAL CONFERENCE
Special Dispatch to The CalL
performance of duties to which he was
assigned.
In response to an inquiry from Cock
reli as to the sort of expenses which
made the allowances to officers necessary.
Carter replied that there were scores of
expenses attendant upon official positions
which no gentleman could or would re.
fuse to meet. This was true of the Pres
ident of the United States and it was
true of the Governor General of Cuba.
Stewart supported the War Depart
ment in making allowances to the officers
in Cuba for extraordinary expenses.
Baccn, the author of the resolutions,
discussed them at some length. He dis
sented strongly from the proposition that
the President could collect and disburse,
according to his unrestrained judgment,
the resources of Cuba. He did not have that
unlimited power. He maintained that thÂ»j
law of the United States expressly forbadt
the giving of army officers any additional
compensation above their regular pay. If
allowances were necessary by reason of
their assignment to duty in Cuba, the
matter ought to have been brought, in his
opinion, to the attention of Congress. He
believed it was a dangerous precedent foi
the executive branch of the Government
to fall into the habit of violating the law
thus openly.
Defends thÂ« Administration.
In an extended discussion of the sub
ject Platt of Connecticut expressed the
opinion that it would be found that no
officer had received an additional salary
Allowances probably had been made and
he deemed such allowances as perfectly
proper. He pointed out that Cuba was
not now and probably never would be a
part of the United States. It was foreign
territory. It was occupied by the army
of this country under command of the
President in consonance of internatioal
law. In this case, he said, the military
authorlty was supreme and was limited
only in its administration of the affairs
of the island by the provisions of inter
national law. The President was the
ch:ef power on the island and there could
Â£ no other Po^'^r there. Platt thought
tnat ir there had been extravagance it
ought to be remembered, but Congress
had no control over the present adminis
tration of Cuba. It waa under military
executiveâand not legislative control.
'"Can we not direct the President to
tton" r TÂ«h2L annsr tr Â° m CUba? " QUCS 
"That is one thing we can do," replied
"Do net the acts of Congress control In
Cuba?" asked Daniel of Virginia.
"No," replied Platt sharply.
"Do not the laws of the United States
as to the pay and emoluments of officers
o* the army apply in Cuba?" persisted
iJaniel.
"As to the nay and emoluments of army
officers, yes/ 1 replied Platt; "but as to
what shall be done In Cuba, no. Our oc
cupation of Cuba is military and Is under
"ecyrtve and not lesrislative authority "
v here does the President get this
great authority?" again asked Daniel
Trom the constitution," replied Platt
As commander in chief of the army the
President has authority far beyond the
power which may be conferrM upon him
by Congress."
Fruits of Imperialism.
Daniel, replying to Platt. expressed sur
prise at the statements made by the Con
necticut Senator. It was the first time, he
said, that he had ever heard the doctrine
of absolutism of the President of the
Lnited States asserted on the Senate floor
i " Isn . l this simply the blossoming of the
Imperialistic tree?" suggested Tillman.
It is not the blossoming of the tree,"
continued Daniel. "It U far tvyond that.

thine to remind the people of the country
of the fearful precipice on the brink of
which they are standing."
Chandler agreed with Platt that the
President could make allowances for the
military officers in Cuba, but he did not
believe that he could legally increase their
salaries.
On the question of the control of the
military Chandler held that military
officers serving In foreign territory were
subject to the control of laws passed by
Congress. ' *
Tillman conF'dered tha discussion as
premature and thought it had been

edgment of the Secretary of War that he
had been making additional payments to

Perkins Appeals for Quay.
The Quay resolution was taken up and
Perkins of California spoke in favor of
the seating of Quay as a Senator from
Pennsylvania on the appointment of the
Governor. He said he was not actuated in
assuming this position by mere personal
motives, but that he was controlled by
the law and the constitution
Perking continued that the' Governor of
a State ought to have the power to ap
point a Senator in the event of. the fail
ure of the Legislature to elect, and in the
case under consideration he believed he
had that power and the appointment of
Quay was entirely proper. To his mind
the case indicated the reed of a change in
the method of electing United States Sen
ators. He believed that year by year it
was becoming more obvious that Sena
tors should be elected by the people and
he expressed the belief that Congress
should submit fb the Legislatures a con
stitutional amendment to that end.
At the conclusion of Perkins' speech the
Quay case was laid aside until Monday.
The Senate then, at 4.-<ts p. m., adjourned.
ROOT IS READY TO
DEFEND HIS COURSE
Â¦WASHINGTON, . April 21.â Secretary
Root made a brief statement at the "War
Department to-day in reference to the
charge that extravagant allotments had
been made to the principal army officers
in service in Cuba for the maintenance of
their establishments out of the revenues
of the island. He said that about a year
ago, before he came into office, represent
ations were made that it was impossible
for army officer? to live on their salaries
in Cuba. The question of providing foi
their extra expenses out of the revenues
of the island was suggested by Secretary
Alger, and the Attorney General was
called upon for an opinion on the subject.
He held that there was no legal objection
to such procedure, and his opinion was
approved by the then Secretary of War.
Secretary Koot said that allotments for
extra expense were made at that time and
have since been continued to four officers
namely, the Military Governor of the Isl
and, the Military Governor of the city of
Havana, the Collector of the Port of Ha
vana and the Treasurer of the island. The
Secretary said that altogether they dia
not exceed $15,000 or $16,000 a year.
Secretary' Root said that Colonel Black
the engineer officer at Havana, did not
receive any extra allowance, but that he
certainly was entitled to it.
Although showing that the plan was
fully approved by him. Secretary Root
made it clear that it was originated by
his predecessor, Secretary Alger. At the
time of the original allowance the office
of Governor General was held by General
Brooke, who recently was succeeded by
General Wood, the incumbent: General
William Ludlow was the Military Gover
nor of Havana, and received an allow
ance as such. The office held by him has
been abolished, to take effect on the Ist
prox. The military department formerly
in his command had been merged into the
Department of Havana and Pinar del
Rio. In command of General Lee. It Is
not known whether or not the latter offi
cer will receive the allowance heretofore
made to General Ludlow, but it is a fair
assumption that he will.
The other two officers favored with ex
tra allowances are Colorel T. H. Bliss of
the commissary department, who holds
the office of Collector of the Port of Ha-
Citizens of the Town Lay Aside Business Cares and
Give Themselves Up to Three Days- of

NOT READY
TO REPORT ON
CANAL ROUTE
Commissioners Ask Many
Months to Consider
the Matter.
Concessions Held by the French Com
pany May Prove a Serious
Block to Favorable
Legislation.
>
WASHINGTON. April 2Lâ The Isthmian
Canal Commissioners have concluded that
with all possible expedition they cannot
complete their report upon their examina
tions of the various isthmian routes for
a canal before next December. They
could, of course, make the roughest kind
of a preliminary report earlier, but this
would only be upon absolute direction and
with reluctance. The exchanges that took
place between the Commissioners and the
heads of the Central American govern
ments during the visit of that body to
that part of the world did not commit
any or the Presidents to a relinquishment
of sovereignty over any of the projected
canal routes in favor of the United
States, according to one of the Commis
sioners. But this point of sovereignty is,
after all, inconsequential at this stage, in
the belief of the commission, the members
of which do not see that any particular
benefit is to result from any assertion of
sovereignty over the soil as long as the
right of the United States to protect the
canal line is conserved In the treaties.
The proposed action of the House of
Representatives in amending the pending
Nicaraguan canal bill by striking out the
provision for the erection of fortifications
along the route of the canal is regarded
as making the measure far more accepta
ble to the administration, but it is still
believed to be absolutely necessary to
make the ratification of the Hay-Paunce
fote treaty a condition precedent to the
adoption of any canal bill.
NEW YORK, April 21.â J. T. Ford, gen
eral manager of a railway and steamship
line in the United States of Colombia, is
in the city. Mr. Ford is an engineer and
represented Colombia on the Pan-Ameri
can Canal Commission. He strongly fa
vors the building of the Panama canal,
and gave the reasons for his position to a
Times reporter.
"I was with the commission for some
time," said Mr. Ford, "and I have given
a great deal of time and study to this
canal, which is a vital one to the Ameri
can people. I favor the building of the
Panama canal, and I think that if it is
done the people of the United States will
be the gainers.
"There is only one thing, according to
my mind, which complicates the matter,
and that is the franchise question. The
French company owns the right of con
cession, and it will undoubtedly demand
a stiff price for them. These concessions
have still four years to run and. In my
opinion, that will prove to be the one
drawback to legislation favorable to the
building of the Panama canal."

Senate agreed to the two resolutions of
fered yesterday by Bacon of Georgia call
ing upon the Secretary of War for infor
mation as to the allowances made to
army officers stationed in Cuba and Porto
Rico and the sums expended in providing
quarters, equipages and other conven
iences for them. The debate took a wide
range, rr.r.r.y Senators participating in It.
Consideration of the Quay case was re
turned, and Perkins of California present
ed an argument favorable to Quay's claim
to a seat In the Senate under the Gover
nor's appointment.
A bill increasing the limit of cost for
the Leadville (Colo.) public building to
SU7.OOQ was passed soon after the Senate
convened.
At the request of Cullcm of Illinois the
conference report on the Hawaiian civil
government bill was laid before the Sen
ate. It was disagreed to and a new con
ference requested, Culiom. Morgan and
Clark of Wyoming being named as con
ferees.
Jones of Arkansas offered and secured
the adoption cf a resolution directing the
Attorney General to "send to the Senate
a statement of the action taken by him
in the case of Jorge Cruse, a resident of
Porto Rico, alleged to have been brought
into this country under a contract to la
bor in the United States, and what steps
if any have been taken or are in contem
plation looking to proceedings against
either the said Jorge Cruse or the party
bringing him into the United States."
The two resolutions offered by Bacon
yesterdayâ the one calling on the Secre
tary of War to Inform the Senate whether
United States array officers in Cuba and
Porto Rico were in receipt of salaries or
other compensation for their services in
addition to their regular pay as officers,
and the second calling upon the Secre
tary of War for detailed information re
specting the amounts expended for quar
ters, decorations of quarters, equipages
Intended for army officers in Cuba and
Porto Ricoâ were laid before the Senate.
Supported by Pettigrtw.
Pettlgrew, the Eer.lor Senator from
Eouth Dakota, delivered a characteristic
afliiress In support of the resolutions. He
<r.:'.r:zed vigorously the statements made
by the President and the War Depart
ment in response to his resolutions, maln-
Tair.'.r.jr they were not competent or satis
factory. Hawley. chairman of the Mili
tary Affairs Committee, resented the
statement* of the South Dakota Senator
as "reckless cjid unwarranted," and as
f rttd that ail information required by
The Senate would be furnished In dvÂ©
titne.
Carter of Montana, in an explanation
cf the- subject, which he had Investigated.
eaJd that additional salaries had not been
granted to army officers on service in
Cuba or in Porto Rico. "VVhen the UnlteC
States assumed the functions of govern
ment In Cuba and in Porto Rico army
officers were assigned to perform civil as
â¢well as military duties. These officers.
Carter said, were thrust Into positions
where their expenses were necessarily in
creased. He instanced the case of an
officer of his own acquaintance who
found it Impossible to meet his additional
necessary expenses out of his regular pay.
He therefore asked to be relieved from
duty in Cuba or given an allowance for
expenses. He was given an allowance of
$ISOO a year because the Secretary of War
and the President felt that the officer

TULARE, April 21.â The concluding
festivities of the three days' Floral
Carnival took place to-night, and
when the curtain dropped on the
last act of the "Merrie Companie"
the citizens wended their ways
homeward well satisfied with the enter
tainment which had been provided them.
The principal feature was the floral pa
rade, and the streets through which the
procession passed wero thronged with
townspeople and visitors from the neigh
boring country for miles around. The
floats were many and handsome, and
floats, carriages and bicycles all bore evi
dence of the fact that the citizens know
how to use the blossoms with which na
ture has so beneficently endowed Callfor-
nia to good advantage. It seemed as
though everything movable for miles
around had been brought into the city,
and every rou?h piece of man's handi
work was hidden under a wealth Of fra
grant flowers. The horsemen also occu
pied a prominent part In the procession,
and in every case horse and rider were
burdened with floral wreaths.
The festivities began on Thursday even
ing when the president was inaugurated.
After this ceremony there were patriotic
songs and speeches and a number of pret
ty tableaux. - Â¦/. ' , .Â¦
Chief among the features of the second
day were the baby show, under the auspi
ces of the Women's Christian Temperance
Union, and an operetta by the Bach Piano
Club. The operetta was rendered under
' the able management of Mrs. Ada Kruse,
while Mrs. P. T. Roache and Mrs. E. Hol
land had charge of the baby show.
After the parade to-day a May Queen
was crowned and there was a merry
May day dance, arranged by Mrs. J. R.
Hitchcock. This was followed by a bas
ket bail fame between selected teams
from the Tulare High School. The day's
sports concluded with the comic operetta.
"The Merrie Companie," given under the
direction of Messrs. C. S. Nicewanger, P.
T. Woods and Miss Mabel Smith.
The committee was as follows: Mrs. R.
T. McMillan, president; Mrs. Ij. L. Aber
crombie, secretary: Mrs. J. L. Farrer,
treasurer: Mrs. A. J. Pillsbury, Mrs. L. L.
Abercrombie and J. R. Scott, on floral pa

WOULD AID THE POOR
OF THE PHILIPPINES
General Wheeler Sets on Foot a
Movement Among Catholic Wo
men in the United States.
WASHINGTON, April 21.â General Jo
seph Wheeler, in a letter to Miss Fannie
Wheelan, a prominent Catholic of this
city, has set on foot a movement to aid
the poor of the Philippine and Ladrone
Islands. General Wheeler says:
"During my recent visit to the Philip
pines and the Ladrbnes I was much im
pressed with the great devotion . of the
'Â¦Â¦women and it occurred to me that it
would be a graceful thing for the Catholic
women of our country to show their ap
preciation of the piety of their sisters
of the East in some substantial way.
j While on the island of Guam, where there
I are six churches, I inquired what would
be the most acceptable present and was
informed that the churches, which are
very similar to our 1 , small country
churches, need stations of the cross."
Miss Wheelan is associated with Mrs.
Thomas F. Ryan of New York in the work
for poor churches of the United States
of the Tabernacle Society, the object of
which is to furnish necessary articles for
churches which are too poor to procure
them. Their work has been chiefly with
1 the Indian- missions.
quiries from all parts of the city as to
the progress of the count. The Mayor. In
order to vary the monotony of his duties,
facetiously sent out word at one time that
one of the ballot boxes had been stolen.
The Mayor found that he was likely to
engender a riot, however, and for the rest
of the niÃht stuck close to the facts.
Heavy work was done by the friends of
Miss McAdams to-day. One of the bal
lot-boxes contained 21,000 votes for her,
the majority of which were cast to-day.
Miss McAdams will have the appointment
of a number of maids of honor, who will
not be announced till next week. Miss
McAdams is. tall, a demi-blonde and very
attractive. She will be crowned on a
throne now being erected in Capitol Park.
Seats are being built to enable several
thousand people to witness the ceremony,
which will be conducted on a grand scale.

there was no demonstration until Circuit
Clerk Ford finished reading the verdict,
which was:
"We, the jury, tind the defendant not
guilty."
As the last words were read the crowd
arose and pent up a wild cheer. Colonel
Colson was standing near the witness
chair. The crowd took no notice of the
court officers, who pounded vigorously,
but piled over the railings surrounding
Colson and insisted on shaking hands
with him. They gave an ovation to the
jury and to Colonel James Andrew Scott,
Colson's chief counsel. The cheering was
kept up until Colson left the courtroom,
and as he did so it was laken up by the
lteckham soldiors in front of the court
house, to whom the colonel gracefully re
turned a salute. To-night he is receiving
dozens of telegrams from all over Ken
tucky and from other States congratulat
ing him on his acquittal.
The tragedy in connection with which
Colson was tried occurred on January
16. In a duel with Lieutenant Ethelbert
F. Scott in the lobby of the Capitol Hotel,
crowded at the time with people, Colson
killed his antagonist, Scott, and Luther
W. Demaree and Charles Julian, bystand
ers, and wounded Captain B. B. Golden,
who accompanied Scott and whom Col
pon's friends charge with having taken
part in the battle. Both Scott and Colson
implied their pistols, iifteen or twenty
shots being lired in all.
Scott had seven bullets in his body;
Colson was wounded in the arm. The
weight of the evidence was that he re
ceived this wound early in the light and
that Scott fired before Colson arose from
his chair.
The prosecution, after the instructions
of Judge CantriU, to-day virtually aban
doned the charge of murder and endeav
ored to get a conviction for manslaugh
ter on' the theory that Scott was killed
after he had retreated and in good faith
withdrawn from the fight. Colonel Col-
Fon was tried on the indictment charging
him with the murder of Scott. While the
indictment for killing Demaree has not
been disposed of it will be dismissed in
view of the failure of conviction in any
degree for the killing of Scott. The Indict
ment will be filed away on motion of the
attorney for the commonwealth on Mon
day.
Colonel Colson entertained a party of
friends to-night. He will leave to-mor
row for his home at Miridlesboro.
HEW FINDS OF
GOLD IN THE
NOME DISTRICT
Rich Strikes Reported by
Passengers on the Cot
tage City.
C. P. Dam, a Seattle Miner, Says That
Conditions Do Not Warrant a
Big Stampede From the
States.
SEATTLE, April 21.-A big strike. In
which gold running as high as $40 to the
pan was found, has been made 10) miles
east of Nome.
This information was brought to tms
city to-day by three men who arrived on
the steamer Cottage City from Nome.
They are J. D. Morgan, J. H. Fredericks
and E. Erickson. These three left Cape
Nome January- 6 and traveled overland to
Kadiak, where they took a steam whaler
to Sitka, there transferring to the Cot
tage City. The strike was made on a small
creek. The first several pans ran about
$25 to $35. As bedrock was scraped the
amount reached $40.
Great excitement followed. A stampede
has taken place from Nome, but only
those who were footloose took part in it.
the rest believing that they had as good
a property as they. wanted.
Mr. Morgan said to-day: "Cape Nome
and the contiguous country is richer than
people have estimated. There will be this
summer the greatest mining camp the
world has ever seen."
The Morgan party is credited with hav
ing $60.0<XÂ» between them, all Cape Nome
gold. The parties will equip themselves
with everything of the best and return
to Nome on the first steamer.
C. P. Dam. well known in Seattle, also
returned to-day from Nome. He says that
other new discoveries of gold have been
made at Bonanza, twenty-two miles this
side- of Nome, which promises to outrival
the great gold camp. He says that there
is not enough gold to warrant a big stam
pede from the States. He says that boats
can hardly reach Nome before June 1 on
account of the ice. The weather when he
left was 40 degrees below zero, but Feb
ruary was a mild month. No winter pros
pecting has been done. A stampede took
place to Norton Bay in December to some
new discoveries. Nome is quiet and order
ly and no one seems to anticipate any
trouble with claims this season. Mr. Dam
will return on the first boat north.
MINERS AT NOME
SUFFER FROM COLD
The Supply of Coal and Wood Is Al
most Exhausted and Exorbitant
Prices Are Charged.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA. B. C , April 21.â Two United
States mail carriers who left Nome on
January 24 arrived here, via the Katmai
route, this niorain?:. They bring news
that the great scarcity of fuel is the. most
alarming problem in the diggings. The
cold is piercing in intensity, and lack of
wood ia not only causing great distress,
but it ie feared that it will cause loss of
life, as there is no means of keeping min
ers from freezing. All the wood that could
be gathered for miles on either side of
Nome, excepting a few piles which some
had cornered, had been consumed by the
middle of January. There was talk of
miners' meetings to compel divisions of
fuel. Stealing from piles were common
and miners were guarding their piles with
rifles. One man was shot while stealing
wood. Drift wood sells for $50 per cord,
and what coal there is for $150 a ton.
The alleged strikes on the Siberian side,
of which considerable was heard a few
weeks ago, have not been accepted seri
ously by the people of Nome, and there is
no thought of a stampede in the direction
of Russian territory, even if there was no
barrier to possession.
At Norton Bay Christmas was followed
by a series of tragedies which are but
hinted at in the latest issues of the Nome
papers. They Involved the killing of one
man named Wright, the slow death by
starvation and cold of another named
Keyser. the disappearance of a third.
Scott, and the accidental death of Haines,
a fourth.

Jesse C. Rains cf Los Angeles An

Special Dis-ratch To The Call.
LOS ANGELES, April 21.â Early in the
afternoon of April J> Miss Maud Murdock
Eelford carefully prepared her toilet and
I left her home. Although her mother
gave her a parting k:ss and lovingly bade
her good-by, little did she suspect that
her daughter would return a bride. A
block frum the parental roof she met her
lover, Jesse C. Rains, who awaited her
with a prancing team that swiftly carried
them to the parsonage of Rev. D. H. Gil
man, where a simple ceremony that made
them husband and wife was performed.
The hasty wedding is the outcome of a
love affair that had its birth at the old
mission cf San Juan de Capistrano. When
Jesse C. Ra:r.s left Lcs Angeles several
weeks ago to visit his friend. Don Marco
Foster, at Capistrano he was heart free;
' but an hour later; after he had met Miss
Belford at the mission, that she also vis
ited at the same time in company with
her parents, both were pinned with Cu
pid's dart. Brief words were spoken, but
the attachment was mutual. The hasty
marriage is the penalty that Papa Belford
has to pay for his persistent objections.
Although young Rains soupht the hand of
the Belford heir in a manly manner and
asked for the parental permission to wed
the fair Maud.- when formal refusal was
follow* d by chilling reception*, the elope
ment was planned.
Â«*â¢ I-ast nlcht the bride and groom were
the principals at a wedding dinner served
at the Rains residence, but Papa and

17A NATIONAL ART COMMISSION.
AT the request of the Public Art League there
has been introduced into Congress a bill pro
viding for the establishment of an "Art Com
mission of the United States." The commission is to
be composed of the president of the American Insti
tute of Architects, president of the National Sculpture
Society, president of the National Academy of De
sign, and two other citizens of the United States to
be appointed by the President, and to hold office for
six years each.
' The commission is to be charged with the duty "of
examining with reference to artistic merit the designs
or models of every work of art to be purchased, con
structed, or offered as a gift, whether of sculpture,
painting, architecture, or landscape architecture, in
cluding designs for coin, seal, medal, note, stamp,
or bond to be fabricated. The approval of the com
mission shall be requisite to the acceptance of said
work of art or the adoption of said design or model.
Provided, however, that no design or model by any
member of the commission shall be admitted to com
petition; and provided further that the provisions of
this act shall not apply to the architect of any public
building the cost of which building shall not exceed
the sum of $50,000, except courthouses, postoffices,
custom-houses and permanent hospitals."
Whether the manner in which the personnel of the
commission is made up is the best that could be de
vised may be doubted, for it would place the commis
sion under the control of New York architects and
a:tists, to the virtual exclusion of the rest of. the
country, but the need of such a commission is mani
fest. The Federal building now in process of con
struction in this city will long stand as an evidence
of a lack on the part of the Government officials of
artistic sense in selecting the site and of architectural
skill in designing the building. That edifice may be
useful to the Government, but it will never be an or
nament to the city. In fact, the only thing that atones
for the selection of such an obscure site for a public
structure is the kind of barn fashioned edifice that is
to be placed on it, and the only excuse for the plain
ness of the edifice is the obscurity of the site.
The work which the munificence of Mrs. Hearst has
made possible in designing a vast architectural
scheme for the State University ought to have its
counterpart in an elaborate supervision of the.' art
and the architectural work of the Government. It is
pointed out by the Art League that "Congress has
under consideration at the present time a memorial
bridge to Arlington, a boulevard through the Mall,
the enlargement of the Executive Mansion, a munici
pal building for the District of Columbia, a Hall. of
Records, a Supreme Court, and numerous statues
and buildings for future use. The question for those
interested in the artistic development of the country
is, Shall these truly great projects be executed with
out a well considered and developed plan to group
buildings,' landscape, statues and bridges in one hat
moriious and grand whole, or shall they be executed
as at present, under separate departments, here and
there^ â anywhere â without general plan or grouping,
and with little taste in individual structures?".
The ability of American artists and architects to
produce great effects has been amply demonstrated
whenever they have been afforded a fair opportunity
to do so. The; magnificence produced in the tem
porary structures at the Columbian Exposition at
Chicago was, a striking proof of what they can ac
complish under favorable circumstances. Ah art

"The play Is laid in Austria, between
1830 ar.d 1832. It commences with a scene
at Baden, a gay health resort situated at
a comparatively short distance from
the Austrian capital. It serves chiefly as
a prologue for the Introduction of per
sonages, of whom the most important, af
ter the Duke of Relchstadt, are Flam
' beau, an old Grenadier Guard, who has
succeeded in approaching his idol's son
by getting engaged as lackey in the
Schonbrunn paJace to Metternich; the
Emperor Francis: Marie Louise, the
Duke's mother; and the Countess Camer
ata. There are in all no fewer than forty
nine personages whose names appear on
the playbill, to say nothing of numerous
other stage-walkers. The drama was,
however, written especially for Mme.
Sarah Bernhardt. and, therefore, has the
defect or advantage of throwing every one
else completely into the shade. For any
one else the role of I'Alslon would be
crushing; but Mme. Bernhardt's marvel
ous talent elicited loud applause from the
house, which was crowded with dramatic
critics and the elite of Parisian society."
The final scene, which is pronounced by
the Paris dramatic critic of the London
Times to be wholly unique In literature,
Is thus described by that writer:
"It Is the custom at the Austrian court
that when a member of the imperial fam
ily receives the deathbed sacrament all
th# others should be present. But it is de
sired to conceal from the King of Rome
the fact that his last hour is at hand.
The most captious critic will not deny that what
the Rev. Edwards Davis lacked in performance he
compensated' for in promises of love. The letters of
the ex-reverend gentleman 1 indicate that he- is a
disciple. of the Ella Wheeler Wilcox. school. .

AMERICAN CHARITY FOR INDIA.
REPORTS from Washington 'are to the effect
that the Navy Department has chartered a
5000-ton steamer to carry wheat and other food
supplies collected by charitable associations in the
United States to the plague and famine stricken peo
ple of India. Upward of 3500 tons of such supplies
have been already contributed, and it is assured that
within a short time the full amount of the steamer's
carrying capacity will be forthcoming, and she will
then start across the ocean on her mission of bene
volence.
The Indian famine is the most extensive calamity
that has befallen the human race in recent times. The
prolonged drought has withered everything in the
fields of a vast region extending over 300,000 square
miles and having a population of upward of 40,000,000
people. It is stated that at this time more than
3,500,000 persons are receiving governmental relief
and are dependent upon it as the only recourse
against starvation. Moreover, the situation grows
worse every day and will continue to do so for months
to come, as the usual rains of the country are not due
until far in the summer.
It is to be deplored that this widespread famine has
befallen India at a time when the British Government
is engaged in a war so extensive that the British peo
ple are neglectful of the demands of India upon their
charity and their justice; and the evil is all the
worse because that war is so offensive to American
sympathies that many persons who would otherwise
be eager to assist in raising funds for the relief of the^
famine-stricken people will hesitate to do so, because
of their conviction that the British Government
itself should be left to face the wrong which an unjust
war in Africa compels it to inflict upon a starving
people in India.
Fortunately for the sufferers of plague and famine,
American charity. on the whole is above the reach of
prejudice. The abhorrence of the British invasion of
the Transvaal and Orange Free State will not entirely
check the generous feelings for the people of India.
The steamer which sets forth under the American
flag and at the cost of the American Government to
carry the free contributions of American people to the
starving poor will attest once more the abounding
liberality and humanity of our people. There has
never yet been a call for help, in any part of the world
to which we have not promptly responded, and this
is not to prove an exception to the rule.
Republican voters in the Fifth Congressional Dis
trict are being taught the evil of the Burns type of
politicians. It will not require many more lessons to
teach voters that everything the Mexican represents
is the plague of politics.

REORGANIZED POPULISM.
THE general movement for the disentanglement
of the Populist party from Democracy has
reached and touched California. A committee
has issued a call for a simon-pure, middle-of-the-road,
anti-fusion Populist State convention, to send dele
gates to a national convention which meets in Cin
cinnati May 9. It is the general judgment of keen
politicians that this attempt to precipitate Populism
out of the Democracy with which it has been merged
comes too late to be effective. ' The Populist party
was once so strong as to compel the country to
reckon with it. As its numbers rose it felt the pangs
of approaching responsibility for the government,
and if its rate of increase had continued it had a fair
prospect of getting a majority and electing a one
lerni President. But just as the Populist Samson's
hair was getting !or.g the Democratic Delilah sheared
him, and instead of walking off with the gates of
Gaza, he could not to-day lift, the latchstring of a
shack. . .... .
Populism is so enfeebled by the debauchery of
fusion that it cannot make an independent showing,
nor csn it even carry any ponderable strength to
Bryan in a fusion. In California especially no new
part}' ever made such rapid headway. It elected
members of Congress and a large number of local
officers. In the Union, beginning with its earlier form
with General Weaver as its candidate for President in
18S0, it cast 306,219 votes in the whole country. In
1832, with Weaver again as its candidate and going
under its present party name, it cast in the Union
1,025,187 votes and carried twenty-three electoral
votes in five States.
Let it be remembered that this marvelous growth
was not helped by hard times, for the panic had not
appeared in 1892. That vote was the result of devo
tion to the principles of the party. In 1896 Bryan
came wooing, and. against the protest of the leaders,
who had conducted the parry out of adolescence into
adult strength, the party fused and thereupon disap
peared. In all our history there is no other case of
such a complete evaporation of a political movement
that had suddenly become so formidable that it had
control of the Federal Government within its reach.
Notwithstanding all their blunders, the Bryan lead
ers must be credited with exceeding smartness in
drowning Populism without even leaving its gar
ments on the bank to identify the victim.
The Populist vote in 1892 showed an increase over
General Weaver's preceding candidacy of 344 per
cent, or at the rate of nearly 29 per cent per annum.
At that rate by 1896 the Populist vote would have
been 2,213.75^, but as nothing succeeds like success
it would probably have exceeded three millions, and
would have reduced Brj-an Democracy to third place.
But it looked upon the fusion wine when it was red.
and now has woe and redness of eyes and wounds

THE wonderful success achieved for
himself and the renown gained for
â¢ Edmond Rostand In the production
of "Cyrano de Bergerac" come to
be equaled if not surpassed by
Sarah Bernhardt in the rendering
of "L'Aiglon" at the Theatre Sarah Bern
hardt, Paris. The success of the earlier
work made great expectations for the
later one, though they were built on dif
ferent lines, and Bernhardt has risen to
the fullest height of the occasion. With
practically no exception the Continental
and British critics have had nothing but
praise for the play and for Bernhardt s
impersonation of the chief character. And
while they say that the dramatist has not
in "L'Alglon" reached the masterly
heights that he attained in "Cyrano," all
agree that the actress has never appeared
in stronger light-
Of her the dramatic critic of the Lon
don Times says; "She is herself, bo to

that never has her tragic genius reached

TRAVELING LIBRARIES FOR SCHOOLS
SEVERAL times of late The Call has had occa
sion to direct attention to the benefits which
traveling libraries confer upon the people of
States that have been sufficiently liberal and progres
sive to adopt the system. We have now to note a
new development in the use of such libraries in
Pennsylvania â one which will doubtless be imitated
elsewhere and prove widely .beneficial.
Under the traveling library system of Pennsylvania
arrangements have been' made for furnishing books
from free public libraries to the public schools, and
sets of books chosen for their fitness for the young
have been selected by the library authorities for that
purpose. A rule has been laid down by the principals
of some of the schools that in order to obtain the
privilege of receiving books from the library the
pupil must show a good report' for the previous week,
both in study and in conduct. The rule has been
found an excellent one, and it is stated that "although
the traveling library has been/installed only a little
more than a month the principals bear testimony to
a marked improvement in both study and deport
ment."
Commenting upon the results - attained in the
schools of that city during the short time of the oper
ation of the traveling library system, the Philadelphia
Record says: "It is to the interest of a principal and
assistant teachers of a public school to obtain the best
possible results from the children intrusted to their
care, and it logically follows that a child who reads
good, wholesome and instructive books, whether they
be of fiction, biography, history or adventure, can bt
more easily induced to imbibe a love for study and a
proper consideration for deportment than one who
only delights in trivial and sensational tales, which
treat of crime or impossible performances of heroes
and heroines of doubtful character and calling. It
seems best, therefore, that the question of book
reading for the young should form at least an ad
junct to school education. It should be, as a rule, a
comparatively easy task for a principal or assistants
to direct the taste of the children into a channel of
proper reading if they have the right books at their
command* This is another and very powerful reason
for a movement to place traveling free libraries in the
public schools."
California has been discreditably slow in following
the example of Eastern States in adopting the new
system of making use of books in public libraries.
The State maintains at Sacramento one of the finest
State libraries in the Union, and yet it is of com
paratively little use to the people. Probably in no
part of the world is there in proportion to population
a greater reading public than in California, nor one
in which so many readers live remote from cities that
have well equipped libraries. In this State, therefore,
more than in any other, would a traveling library fill
a true need of the community. The people have been
dilatory in taking up the issue, but now that Penn
sylvania has demonstrated the value of the system to
the public schools, we may have our school teachers
enlisted in the campaign of education on the subject.
Of one thing we may be sureâ the traveling library
has now become a permanent feature of American
civilization, and until we have adopted it we shall be
counted among the unprogressive States of the Union
and behind the times. â¢
The master of the ship Peru, who could not be

tures would be of vast service^ and while the com
mission should be more representative of the whole
country than is provided for in the present bill, the
measure itself is one that Rents' general support.
BERNHARDT IS THE "WHOLE THING"

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SITNDAY, APRIL 22, 1900.
NO FORTIFIED CANAL.
THE members of Congress who desired to make
the construction of the Nicaragua canal an act
of war have abated their position and are ready
to relinquish the fortification feature of the bill. The
measure has now a good prospect of passing during
this session, and we may reasonably expect that the
work will soon begin and be actively prosecuted to a
conclusion.
In the execution of such a work there is no need of
long delay. With the total resources required to
complete it on hand, there is no reason why it should
not be finished in two years or one year. The labor
needed is in ample supply and may be drawn from
all over the world. The mechanical aids to construc
tion should be made ready in a few weeks, if they
have to be built, but it is probable that the steam
shovels and other application of power needed can
be had without waiting for their construction. Next
to doing the work this .country has an opportunity of
unparalleled magnitude to impress the world with its
speed and skill in the execution of great things.
Facilities that could build, ship, land, transport over
the desert and set up a great steel bridge in Africa
within six weeks after the signing of the contract can
show an equally prompt completion of a waterway
that cuts distances and continents in two.
The utility of the canal to this country and the
world will be great, but the primacy we will acquire
by its completion in a brief time will be of as much
importance to us as the use of the canal when fin
ished. Building it is one of those impressive tri
umphs of peace which emphasize the supremacy of a
nation, and are of greater and more permanent value
than any of the victories of war. The Napoleonic
campaigns put their Captain alongside of Alexander
and Caesar, but their effects were fleeting. The em
pire they cut out and carved into shape by the sword
has long since fallen to pieces. France has left the
Invalides and the Mausoleum to show for all the glory
of the Italian campaign, for Austerlitz, Jena, Lodi
and Marengo. The Havre basin, prepared for the
peaceful commerce of the world, is of more impor
tance to her than all the martial exploits which
drained her treasury of its gold and her people of
their vitality.
Our countrymen have had their heads too much
turned by war of late. They have been too much im
pressed by Roosevelt's call to the "strenuous life,"
and the tiger in them has been appealed to until a
wrong public opinion seemed crystallizing that fore
shadowed a military republic.
We count the country happy in having in prospect
the great object lesson making for peace that will be
in the construction of the canal.
Commerce is called the calm health of nations.
War is their convulsion. It is the death struggle of
some and the death dealing spirit of others. War
weakens a people physically. Commerce makes them
strong. War teaches craft. Commerce thrives by the
practice of honor.
The country will have its mind sweetened and
raised by the building of the canal, and if we can
finish it within twelve months after the first ground
is broken it will be of more material benefit and a
greater blessing to our people than it would be for
us to overcome the whole world in arms.

STEWARDS MEET
WITHOUT TAKING
DECIDED ACTION
Name of Bookmaker Pesch
Now CoDnected With
the Scandal.
Caesar Young, the St. Louis Penciler,
on the Warpathâ Matter Will
Be Taken Up Monday
Night.
The stewards of the Western Turf As
sociation again met in session at the
Palace Hotel yesterday forenoon, later
adjourning until last nighf without giv
ing- out any of .the business of the meet
ing. A quorum not being present in the
evening, nothing was done toward devel
oping any new facts in the turf scandal
involving the names of Jockeys Piggott,
Henry, Willie Martin and Trainer Lynch.
Those supposed to be possessed of in
side Information say one part of the pro
gramme was that Henry, before signing
to ride for W. J. Arkell. was to go East
under the management of Denny Lynch.
The name of Fred Cook, the book
maker, has been connected with the un
savory developments, and now Fred Pesch
is involved in a roundabout way. When
Hard Knot, with Piggott up, was beaten
In a seven furlong run at Tanforan, when
ruling a strong favorite. Pesch. although
supposed to be sailing under reefed sails,
owing to a limited bank roll, too*, a hard
fall out of the colt. It is also said that a
'â¢false hedge" of $500 was made on his
sheet. Still all this is yet to be proved.
Bookmaker Caesar Young, whose name
has been mixed up in connection with
the peculiar running of Sly, showed up
at the Palace Hotel last night in a bel
ligerent frame of mind. He seemed dis
pleased that any one should doubt hi;?
honf-sty. and threatened to disfigure the
countenance of Dan Hanlon, one of the
mare's owners.
' Denny Lynch will be here within a
couple of days, and a new bombshell may
be sprung.
The stewards will meet again on Mon
day evening, when a train of witnesses
will be placed on the rack, it is claimed.

PAINTER ECKLER WAS
KILLED BY A FALL
Became Dizzy While at Work and
Fell a Distance of Twelve
Feet.
R. E. Eckler, a boss painter, was in
stantly killed yesterday forenoon by fall-
Ing off a staging in the rear of a new
building on Dorland street, near Guer
rero. The staging was secure and was
?ut up by Mr. Eckler and one of his sons,
t was only twelve feet from the ground
and the accident was probably due to an
attack of vertigo, as Mr. Eckler had com
plained recently of not feeling well.
Mr. Eckler had been in the painting
business in this city for thirty-three years,
two of his sons being associated with him
for the last few years. He resided with
his family at 934 Dolores street. He was
a native of Springfield. 111.. 64 years old.
CAPTAIN SHOEMAKER
ON INSPECTION TOUR
Chilf of Revenue Cutter Service Here
on His First Visit to the
Coast.
Captain C. F. Shoemaker, chief of the

at Washington, arrived from the East last
night, accompanied by his secretary,
James W. Lee. They are staying at the
California. Captain Shoemaker is here on
a tour of inspection and will spend sev
eral days In this city looking over the
four revenue cutters now in the harbor.
Afterward he will go to Seattle, and wih
probably review the entire fleet before It
starts on its annual cruise to Alaska.
Captain Shoemaker said last night that
this is his first visit to the Pacific Coast
He said that no changes in the Pacific
fleet or in the personnel of its officers is
contemplated.
AUDITOR COMPLAINS OF
TREASURER'S REPORTS
Says They Are Delayed and Threat
ens to Lay the Matter Before
the Mayor.
Auditor Wells threatens to complain to
Mayor Phelan regarding the delay in the
filing of the reports of the City Treasurer.
Wells says that. the work is so far behind
In the Treasurer's office that it hinders
progress in other departments. Reports
should reach the Auditor shortly after the
first of each month, but those for March
have not yet .been received. Treasurer
Brooks admits that his reports are de
layed, but ascribes it to the inadequacy of
his present force. There are so many re
ports to be made out, many of which he
regards as unnecessary, that he has been
obliged to order his clerks to work nights
and Sundays. His books are all posted up
to date, but he says that it is simply im
possible to file the reports earlier unless
he is provided with extra clerks.
THE CAPE NOME
EXCITEMENT
The enterprise and genius of mechanics
throughout the United States has been
directed during the past six months to
ward perfecting machinery for separating
the gold from the sands of the beach at
Cape Nome. At this time, when the sea
son Is drawing to a close, it is easy to see
that the intelligent purchasers of this
machinery have sifted the wheat from the
chaff very carefully and that they, gen
erally speaking, have selected only the
really meritorious machines to do their
work.
The Krogh Manufacturing Company
have sold 57 complete outfits for this coun
try, consisting of a Drake amalgamator
and sand centrifugal pump. Thi3 combi
nation, it has been found, will handle
these sards in large quantities, saving
practically all of the gold which they
ca rry.
The firm is equipped in such a manner as
to be able to build the entire outfit and
assemble the different parts in their own
shops, so that not only is everything com
plete when shipped, but they are able to
supply immediately any lost or broken
parts.
Their Mr. F. J. Drake, who is the in
ventor of the Drake amalgamator, will
himself leave for Nome about May 15.
accompanied by Mr. Krogh of the Krogh
Manufacturing Company, so that with
these two experienced and practical men
on the ground any defect in the setting
up or arranging the machinery for prac
tical work could be easllv remedied.
A short time ago Mr. Remington of Se
attle, who is the proprietor of the Mitchell
amalgamating machine, which in some re
spects resembles the Drake machine, was
In San Francisco. An agreement was en
tered into at the time with him whereby
all imitators of these amalgamators, and
there are many of them, would be prose
cuted to the full extent of the law. If
not in San Francisco they will be cared
for when they reach Capo Nome.
There have been fanciful theories ad
vanced in regard to this subject and the
best methods for. accomplishing one end.
viz., saving this gold. Practically there
has b*en but one machine offered the pub
lic which is in any way satisfactory and
which will do the work. After much ex
pense and trouble it would be an unpleas
ant fact to find one had a pros
pect but no suitable machine for doing
the work. Too great care cannot be
taken in the selection of everything for
one's comfort on such a trip as well as
proper mechanical devices to attain
the desired results. Any person who Is
contemplating this trip can and should
call at 9 Stevenson street and see one of
these machines save 90 per cent of the
gold in the Cape Nome beach sand. They
are in operation . dailyâ both hand and
power machines. â¢

POSTAL MONEY ORDERS
GOOD AT ANY OFFICE
Postmaster Montague Announces an
Innovation for the Benefit of
Business Men.
Postmaster Montague announces that
from date all first and second class post
offices may cash money orders Irrespective
of the place of payment named In such
crder (it b^lng understood that the Iden
tity of the owner shall be established, as
In "all othfT cases). All money orders will
be cashed irrespective of the fact that the
corresponding advices may not have
reached the office upon which such orders
are drawn.
The Postmaster believes that the new
arrangement will be a great accommoda
tion to business men, and that there will
be no risk incurred, as the payee will be
held responsible in case of error or fraud.

nouncement that on July 1 of this yepr
the department will issue a neat invention
by Edward C. Madden. Third Assistant
Postmaster General. It is a little book of
a size convenient for the vest pocket and
contains twelve, twenty-four or forty
e-ipht two-cent stamps, as desired. There
are six stamps to a pape. and between
each page Is a sheet of parafSne paper to
prevent the stamps from sticking to
gether. The price of a twelve-stamp book
will be 25 cents, of a twenty-four-stamp
book .SO cents and of a forty-elght-starap
book SI.

STARTS A ROW
AND IS SHOT
IN SHOULDER
Timothy Nyhan Wounded in
a Water-Front Saloon
by H. Peterson.
Draws a Bevolver and Fires Because
He Fears the Stevedore Is
Bent on Bobbing
Him.
Timothy Nyhan, a stevedore, was shot
in the left shoulder by Harry Peterson, a
foreman for John Rosenfeld, coal dealer,
in a saloon at 2S East street last night.
Peterson was arrested by Officers Clif
ford and Hightower and charged with as
sault to murder at the Harbor police sta
tion.
According to Peterson's story, he was in
the saloon paying a number of men em
ployed by him, when Nyhan, also one of
his employes, commenced to make trou
ble. He had a quantity of money on hi 3
person and suspected that Nyhan was
creating the disturbance so that he might
rob him during the scuffle which would
likely follow. He ordered the man to de
sist, but the latter continued to quarrel
with him and finally threw a glass in hla
direction. To protect himself, he says, he
then drew his revolver and fired, the bul
let, striking Nyhan in the left shoulder.
The wound was superficial and the bullet
was extracted by Dr. McGettigan at the
Harbor Receiving Hospital.
Nyhan. who has the reputation of being
a quarrelsome person, refused to make
any statement.

FORCES MADE
HEROIC DEFENSE
Details of the Last Battle
With the Rebel
Chieftain.
Garrison of the Fort Burrowed Into
the Ground and Suffered Terri
bly From Hunger and
Thirst.
Special IMspatch to The Call.
VICTORIA. B. C. April 21.â Letters re
ceived at Esquimalt give the following
interesting details of the defeat of the
rebel chief. Mat Selleh, in North Borneo
by ihe British and of the destruction of
his forts. It seems that on January 20
the British had occupied Kalansatan, one
of the rebel forts commanding the chief's
stronghold, which at that time it was
found impossible to surround, the rebels
being intrenched in an almost impregna
ble position, and their fort honeycombed
with underground earthworks, like a rab
bit warren.
The attack on the forts brought out
many instances of notable pluck. For in
stance, when the charge was sounded
against one of the forts the attacking
force were suddenly pulled up short by an
outer fence of sharpened bamboo, which
they commenced to cut down. When the
first breach was made a Javanese boy
named Leyman rushed through the open
ing, carrying a quantity of oil, and set
fire to the buildings inside the fort. He
then, under a heavy fire from the enemy,
rushed across and ignited other buildings.
For this heroic deed he was specially men
tioned in the dispatches. During the
operations Mat Sellch's people brought
into action a brass cannon which, on the
third shot, burst, doing much damage.
It was on the 21st of January that the
attack on the principal fort was com
menced. At daybreak a seven-pounder
was placed in position and a general bom
bardment of the place, at ranges of 250
and 4uo yards, was commenced. A house
in the fort of Mat Jator, one oi the chief
supporters of the rebel chief, was set
alight by the shell fire, and soon his whole
fort was burned to the ground. This fort,
which was Intended as a place of retreat
for Mat Selleh, was of Immense strength,
with carefully planned earthworks and
trenches. Tunnels were run through the
solid ground, rendering the place almost
impervious to shell fire. In his report Mr.
Clifford, the Governor, says: "It was a
piece of good luck which led to this fort
being taken without a blow, for it stood
high upon a bluff overlooking the river,
and would have been impossible to take
by storm without the loss of more men
than the force at our disposal could af
ford."
The enemy In Mat Selleh's fort, on see
ing Mat Jator"s fort in flames, with great
pluck climbed up and tried to unroof their
own buildings without success. Comman
dant Harrington, who was in charge of
the British, moved his headquarters to
the precipice where Mat Jator's fort had
been situated, and until the end of Jan
uary kept up a continuous shell fire, so
that Mat Selleh and all his people were
driven to live underground in filthy holes
dug beneath their fort in the solid earth.
Those who ventured to emerge even for a
moment In the daytime were exposed to
a galling fire from tho British positions,
and many in the fort lost their lives. One
evening a Bajau ventured to appear on
the fort wall and shout defiance. He was
Bhot in the legs and fell over, but plucklly
sat up and opened his coat and exposed
his chest. He was immediately shot dead.
On the 2Cth of January the force of the
British North Borneo Company attempted
to cut off the water supply of the fort
by constructing a dam and diverting the
course of the river. At tho same time the
bombardment was increased. The Maxim
had great effect and the ertemy lost heav
ily. This bombardment caused a perfect
stampede of the rebels from one under
ground hole to another. On the following
day a point blank bombardment of the
fort was commenced at 150 yards and im
mense damage was done. During" the
night a number of rebels crept out under
cover of darkness and attempted to rush
the Maxim. They were, however, ob
served and driven off under a heavy fire.
Heavy firing continued throughout from
that on till the 31st. and then, just be
fore daybreak, a Bajau woman crept out
and reported that Mat Selleh had been
killed, and that. the rebels, who had suf
fered heavy loss, had been without food
and water for several days. Three hours
later the Dyak outposts, who had been
continuously engaged all night, got Mnto
the fort and found that the remainder or
the rebels had fled. Â¦"Â¦â¢
The grave of Mat Selleh was found and
the remains exhumed in order that It
might be proven that he was dead. He
had been shot through the left temple, the
bullet carrying away thÂ« back of the
head. It was afterward ascertained that
he had been killed by a Maxim shot on
the day before the capture of the fort,
when within a few feet of the door of the
inner fort. Pursuing parties were* at once
dispatched after the rebels and many
were captured. All Mat Selleh's wives
and women were taken alive.
On examining the fort it was found that
the walls were about six feet high and
ten feet thick. The Inner walls were
equally strong. The whole was surround
ed by a stockade and bamboo chevaux-de
fiise. The ground, too, was thickly planted
with sharpened bamboo.
The rebels suffered terribly while de
fending the fort. Each member of the
garrison had dug himself a hole below
the ground, and in these holes they re
mained, afraid to do any cooking and
suffering from filth, hunger and thirst.

THE IDOL OF THE TURF.
The Most Popular Jockey in America
and England Recommends Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets.
No jockey has ever appealed so strongly
to public favor as Tod Sloan.
He has achieved more than his most
noted predecessors ever attempted and
stands In a class by himself.
Not satisfied with his successes ln his
native country, he went to England and
now his fame as a successful horseman is
on the tip of every tongue not only in
this country and England, but ln every
section of the globe where racing has
found favor.
When Tod first went to England his
temerity was openly laughed at, but the
little American played skittles with his
English rivals and his victories made all
England gasp.
Having the stamp of royal approval, so-
ciety both at home and abroad "lionize"
him and he is feted and petted to an ex-
tent that would turn an ordinary mortal's
head.
The great jockey was ln such demand
socially and dined and wined to such an
extent that it was feared his health
would give way.' Too much society and
the nervous strain of racing told on him.
A two weeks' trip to America made him
acquainted with Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets and their remarkably restorative
effects on a depleted digestive apparatus
and he recommended them in unstinted
terms to a friend, saying. "Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets are the best thing I know
of for keeping the stomach in condition
and appetite in good repair."
Thousands of former dyspeptics can
vouch for the truth of Tod Sloan's words,
as "Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets" have be-
come a household word in America and
few families are without them. One or
two taken after meals keep the stomach
sweet by causing prompt and healthy di-
gestion of the food.
Perfectly healthy people use them after
heavy dinners to keep their good health
and to make sure that no ill effects will
follow an unusually hearty meal. .
Your druggist will tell you or your doc-
tor either that Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
are composed only of digestive ferments,
Asceptic Pepsin. Hydrastis, fruit acids,
etc., and for the strong stomach aa well
as the most delicate constitute a safe-
guard against indigestion and stomach
troubles.
ANDREW PEREZ. THE MISS
ING WOODCHOPPER.
SAN RAFAEL, April 21.â Another
mystery seemingly unfathomable
as the dark shades lurking in its
gloomy depths has flung its shadow
across the already black annals of
Carson Guich. Andrew Perez, a
young woodchopper, has disappeared as
completely as though the earth had
opem-d and swallowed him. and leaves a
young wife and baby in this city to worry
over a husband and father's fate.
A month ago Andrew Perez left his
h<">me with the avowed intention of going
to work in Carson Gulch. Up to two
weeks ago he apparently was doing well
and sent affectionate greetings to his wife
every time the supply wagon visited San
Rnfael.
For several days past, however, these
messages have ceased entirely, and yes
terday Antcne Bonell. a resident of San
Anseuno, informed Sheriff Taylor that
Perez had been missed from the camp for

by the comrades who had worked by his

Gulch.
Perez had been married four years
when, after a violent quarrel with his
wife, he left the house threatening never
PLEA OF BILL-POSTERS.
Local Advertising Firm Objects to a
San Jose Ordinance.
Special DiFi>atch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, April 21.â The San Fran,
cisco bill posters have not abandoned
their fight to maintain sky-scraping bill
boards throughout this city, and to-day
filed an amended complaint in which they
ask that the city authorities be perpetu
ally restrained from Interfering with their
sign boards. The local bill posters inaug
urated a fight several months ago against
Siebe & Green, when the firm first en
tered Into competition here, and succeeded
in having the Council pass an ordinance
limiting the height of billboards to ten
feet. Many signs over twenty feet high
had already been built, and the Chief of
Police was directed to tear these down
and prevent others going up. The firm
applied for an Injunction and brought a
test case in court, but this was knocked
out on demurrer.
In the amended complaint Slebe & Green
claim they have invested over $4000 ln
sign boards; have entered into many ad
vertising contracts, and have boards at
110 different places, and that the monthly
expenditures for these privileges exceed
$100, whether boards are maintained or
not. They declare that one-half of the
city consists of vacant lots, imperfectly
fenced. It is averred the ordinance is un
reasonable and oppressive and repugnant
and discriminates against bill posters, and
will deprive them of liberty to pursue
their lawful business.

FILIPINOS WILL

BITTER END
Captain Gamboni Says There
Never Will Be Peace in
the Islands.
He Brought the First American Cargo
Into Manila and Studied Con
ditions From Both
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN DIEGO, April 21.â The Italian ship
Teocle, Captain Gamboni, which is now
discharging a cargo of cement at the
Spreckels wharf, came near taking a
prominent part in the history of
the United States occupation of
the Philippine Islands, and as it
was Captain Gamboni has the distinc
tion of being the first master of a sailing
vessel to reach Manila with an American
cargo after Manila became a port under
the American flag. His cargo was oil from
New York and he had 60,000 cases or 600,000
gallons of kerosene on board.
When. he sailed into Manila harbor and
found the American fleet in control and
American officers handling the business
of that port he insisted that he be al
lowed a free dischargeâ that Is, free from
port charges â since ne vfas the first to
bring an American cargo into the new
American port. This the captain of the
port promised and the ship paid no
charges.
After discharging her cargo the Teocle
remained in Manila harbor for several
months without taking on ballast. The
reason was\ that the Americans in au
thority there (Admiral Dewey and Gen
eral Otis) were figuring that if the United
States decided to keep the Philippines the
Government would want a storeship at
Manila and would want an iron vessel
for the purpose. The Teocle was
the only iron vessel in the bay.
and for that reason the captain
decided to remain within reach for a time,
as a Government contract is usually a
pretty good contract, no matter what
Government you may happen to be work
ing for.
Captain Gamboni is half owner of the
ship, but the other half-partner be
came tired of waiting lor him to
get out of Manila, and so made
a charter, for him to go to Aus
tralia in ballast to take on a cargo there.
Just about the time the Teocle had taken
on sufficient ballast for the trip to Aus
tralia the American Congress decided to
retain the Philippines, but it was too late
then for Captain Gamboni to get out of
going to Australia.
During the time of his waiting in Ma
nila Admiral Dewey and General Otis
were several times on board the ship.
Captain Gambonl was also several times
at Malolos, Aguinaldo's capital, being
compelled to go there because the Italian
Consul happened to be a lieutenant in the
insurgent army. Captain Gambonl says
that it was pretty generally understood
that if the American people decided to re
tain possession of the islands there would
be trouble with tho insurgents.
"In fact," said the captain, "I have
heard Aguinaldo say that they would
fight to the very end; that they had
fought the Spaniards and would fight the
Americans; that if they had been look
ing for the protection of any country they
would have applied to England long ago.
It was, however, the general opinion
about Manila that the American jpeople
would not retain the ! Islands. Dewey
never made the remark, so far as I know,
but Consul Williams several times said
that he did not see what the United
States would want to retain the Islands
for. Dewey sometimes smiled under his
gray mustache, but he did not make any
remarks of the kind. Even at a banquet
he would declare that he was not a talker,
but would permit Consul Williams to do
the talking for the party."
Captain Gamboni is of the opinion that
the insurrection will not be broken up in
a hurry and that if the Insurgents are
quieted at this time It will be only long
enough for them to collect a store of arms
and ammunition and gather strength to
break out again. He thought, however,
that it was a pood thing for the islands
that the American Government had decid
ed to retain control, for if left to them
selves It would havo been a constant war
fare between the various tribes and races
there, whereas in the hands of a strong
nation tho islands would some time be
entirely freed from the insurgent element.
to return. A few days' absence, however,
made his heart grow tender, and a lov
ing letter imploring forgivenness Informed
his young wife that he wished to make
amends for bygone troubles. When seen
to-day Mrs. Perez stated that her hus
band was exceedingly quarrelsome and
given to the use of liquor. When drunk,
according to his wife's statement, Perez
was extremely abusive, and in this way
had made many enemies. Mrs. Perez is
at a loss to account for her husband's dis
appearance, while Sheriff Taylor states
that he fears the young woodebopper has
shared the mysterious fate of so many
dwellers in the Black Hole of Marin. who
have vanished entirely and mysteriously,
leaving in their wake whispers and sus
picions of foul crimes, never to be fas
tened on any of those suspected. A spe
cial posse will probably be detailed to
search the ill-omened canyon for some in
dication of the fate that has overtaken
Perez, and while no arrests have yet been
made an investigation may result in sev
eral suspected parties being held for trial.

FEARS OF A FAMINE
BECAUSE OF FLOODS
Washouts on Mississippi Railways
Prevent the Transportation of
Foodstuffs.
MERIDIAN, Miss., April 21.â The ex
tensive rains which have prevailed over
Mississippi and parts of Alabama for
seven days, making the rivers rise to an
unprecedented extent and overflow the
lowlands, are causing suffering and a loss
of property never known before. Thou
sands of acres of farming lands have
been devastated, and early crops will
prove a total loss. Homes have been de
stroyed, and in some cases the occupants
have lost their lives. Thousands of head
of stock have been drowned.
Railroad traffic has been Interrupted to
such an extent that in some of the small
towns fears of a scarcity of foodstuffs are
entertained. Xo road running through the
lowlands has escaped, and some have
been totally blocked for two days at a
time. It is thought the aggregate loss
to railroads will amount to more than a
million dollars.
To-day the situation seems little im
proved. There is slight prospect of a re
sumption of traffic over the five roads
centering here before Monday or Tues
day. The large streams Bouth of her&
continue to rise.
The village of Hickory is completely
surrounded by water, and It is feared
great suffering will result. Jackson is
threatened with a water famine, as fhÂ«j
water works pumping station has been
flooded.

RESIDENTS in theineighborhood of
Hyde and O'Farrell streets were
startled yesterday morning about
9 o'clock by the report of a shot
followed in quick succession by two oth
ers. Immediately afterward a man rushed
out of oOT 1 " Hyde street and ran in the di
rection of the City Hall.
He was Charles C. L. Whitney, whose
family troubles have been recently aired
In both the Police and Superior Courts.
Whitney's wife left him In Illinois in July,
189S and with her four children came here
and have since been living with Mrs. Mag
gie Anderson, Mrs. Whitney s sister, at
&07>A Hyde street. Whitney followed them
to thi3 city and haa been endeavoring to
get his wife to return to him. He Institut
ed a suit against Mrs. Anderson and her
husband for alienating his wife's affec
tions, the latter having threatened a di
vorce suit. i , . . . .
Yesterday morning about 9 o'clock he
went to 507^ Hyde street. His wife was
sweeping the stairway and she Baw him as
he opened the front door. She screamed
and ran up the stairs. Mrs. Anderson
heard her and, divining what was wrong,
she grabbed two revolvers that were on
top of her bureau and ran out to the hall
way. She gave Mrs. Whitney one of the
weapons and told her to shoot. Whitney
kept climbing up the stairs, when he was
confronted by the two women, each with
a revolver. Mrs. Anderson opened fire and
Mrs. Whitney quickly followed. Whitney
wheeled round and ran down the stairs.
Mrs Anderson fired another shot at his
retreating figure. The three bullets missed
him. Two of them lodged In the wall, but
no trace of the third could be found.
The police heard of the shooting and
Captain Seymour detailed Officer McMur
ray on the case. He made an investigation
and reported that the two women simply
defended themselves, as they had good
reason to believe that Whitney had come
to kill them. No action will be taken by
the police unless Whitney cares to take
the initiative.
Whitney, after running away from the
house, went to Judge Cook's courtroom
and personally asked the Judge to with
draw the writ to recover possession of one
of his children. He then hurried away and
it is supposed went to his ranch near Llv
ermore.
Early last month Whitney was arrested
on complaint of his wife for threatening
to kill her, her Bister and the whole fam
ily. The case was heard before Judge
Mogan and in giving their testimony both
Mrs. Whitney and Mrs. Anderson showed
their Intense hatred of him. After the
case had been thrashed out Whitney's
brother promised the Judge that if he dis
missed the case he would take him to
i Nevada and keep him away from this
i State. On that promise the ?itSgÂ« sus
i pended sentence till April 30.
'Â¦ Whitney disregarded his brothers prom
ise and returned to the city and continued
to annoy and threaten his wife. He would
watch for her and would suddenly spring
from a doorway in front of her and cajole
and threaten her. A few days ago he ap
plied for a writ of habeas corpus before
; Judge Cook to recover possession of one
of Ills children.

the analysis of the stomach, but says he
has no doubt that poison will be found
from present appearancea. The body waa
removed at the request of Dr. Black's sla
ter, Mrs. N. M. Kungle.
In an Interview with The Call corres
pondent she said. "I think my brother

Professor Gentry's troupe of animal act

the show, at the corner of Eighth and

daily. So many bad shows have been given

certainly a very pleasing exception to the

which seems human and causes the de

An Important Discovery for Cape
Nome.
Intelligence and brightness are faculties
which are necessary to possess when an
individual contemplates launching a de
vice upon the American people for accom
plishing a result by a method different
from the one now in voguo. These, how
ever, are not the only attributes necessary
to be possessed by such an Individual; he
should have a practical knowledge of the
device to be so exploited and the knowl
edge should be based on actual experience
in the use and handling of the subject
matter. Should the purpose be the sepa
rating of gold from foreign bodies in the
various existing conditions in which it is
found, the person 6hould know the dif
ferent conditions in which gold exists In
the earth and should be familiar with the
suspectibility of the metal to the action
of different chemical conditions and me
chanical devices. Such machinery is not
practical when It depends entirely on
theory for its existence and its utility.
Theoretically a great many machines
have had birth in the past six months for
the separating of the pod found in the
beach sands of Cape Nome. The greater
proportion of these machines have been
designed and perfected by men who had a
more perfect knowledge of farming In a
practical manner than they ever had of
mining. To the careful observer it will
be noticed that the old manufacturers and
patentees of the best mining machinery in
the world have held aloof from this propo
sition. They have realized the fact that
the problem was not one to be solved by
a novice or to be readily Eolved by them
selves.
The primary facts to be considered are
these:
First. The gold found In these sands,
generally speaking, is free.
Second. A great deal of It Is oxidized,
or commonly called rusty gold; and
Third. It is found in conjunction with
the black sand of the beach, which Is
near the same specific gravity as the gold
itself.
This oxidized gold and the black sand
must necessarily be saved by Boms
method of concentration, while the bright
gold can be saved by amalgamation, as It
is generally found in a very fine state. To
devise a machine that would accomplish
in one process both of these results was
no easy taÂ«k and until the present time
It Is =afÂ«* to state it has not been done.
George E. Woodbury, the veteran concen
trator manufacturer of this coast, whose
name is almost a synonym for the per
fect separation of precious metals from
foreign bodies, gives the mining world
an amalgamating table which meets the
requirements of this case perfectly.
The machine is constructed along much
thÂ«> Fnme lines as those employed in the
manufacture of h!s Imperial Concentrat
ing Table. It Is constructed with a timber
foundation, upon which is mounted a
shaking frame, which Is attached to the
foundation frame by means of spring
Pt^ndards. the phaking frame or table
being covered with peculiarly shaped
longitudinal riffles and corrugated rubber,
the combination of both being adapted to
â¢aye the gold which has no affinity for
silver plates or amalgamation, commonly
called rusty gold. Upon the corrugated
rubber surface is arranged a series of sil
ver plates which hayÂ» a tendency to save
the free grold: the riffles and rubber sav
ing the oxidized gold and black sand.
The mechanism for driving the table has
a peculiar motion; the combination of the
whole not only saves perhaps the 40 per
cent of the values of the free gold con
tained in the sand, but will save a large
per rent of the remaining GO per cent of
the values contained in the sand, resulting
In the return of 85 or 90 per cent of the
entire mineral worth of thp Band. This
machine can hp seen at the factory of Mr.
Woodbury. 223 First street, and he will ex
plain its construction to any person desir
ing to see it. ! -'. :Â¦ ' ;Â¦'â¢".

Dodge Takes Issue With. Mr. Wells
and Claims That His Figures
on City Valuations Axe
'Too High.
? t
Assessor Dodge yesterday expressed the
opinion that the estimate made by Audi
tor "Wells of J450.000.000 as the assessed val
uation of the city and county, in figur
ing the probable tax levy for the next
fiscal year, -wag entirely too high. As a
result he claims that the tax rate of $1.0753
for all city purposes will be Increased if
the Auditor's figures hold. Dodge visited
the t Auditor yesterday and asked him
upon what Information he had based hia
estimate. . . .
"Last year. Dr. Dodge, you brought the
roll up to J40a,000,000." replied Wells, "and
I have been informed upon all sides that
you will Increase that amount this year.
I thought that $400,000,000 would be a safe
figure to calculate upon."
Dodge stated that ?25.000,000 which he
had assessed on bonds is now in litiga
tion and If the Supreme Court decided
against the city that much would have to
be deducted from the roll. Dodge admit
ted, however, that the limit for assessing
personal property was now $40 instead of
$50, as formerly, and this would raise the
figures somewhat.

In San Francisco wno will not re
member Emanuel Elzas. While
connected with The Call he made a
host of friends, all of whom will be glad
to learn that "Manny" Is doing remark
ably well as a reporter on the Sydney
Morning Herald.
About a month ago Elzas made himself
famous In New South Wales. His fame,
however, rested upon a case of mistaken
identity. Emanuel Is a striking coun
terpart of Mr. Wood, the New South
Wales Minister of Public Lands, and It
was that likeness that made him famous.
The occasion was the departure of the
"Bushmen's" contingent from Sydney for
South Africa. The colony had offereu a
second regiment to the mother country
and the offer had been accepted. A thou
sand picked men mounted on some of the
finest horses In the world were marching
down George street toward Circular quay.

protested apair.st the proposes fare reduc

passed it would bo compelled to lessen the

In the Â¦war with Spain with Squadron A.
received from President McKinley a com
mission as captain and remained in the
United States service until January, 1599.
Trhen he resigned and returned to practice
his profession in Mew Tork.
This eng-acement. which is one of the
many that has followed the last winter
pea Eon. is beyond doubt of wider interc-st
Than any yet announced. When Miss
Crocker came to New York last autumn
Ftories of her great wealth were freely
circulated and it was stated by those wha
seemed to be well informed that Miss
Crocker's fcrtur.e was fully SS.OCO.OOO.
Miss Crocker's mother was a Miss
Easton of San Francisco, cousin of Og
der. Mills and Mrs. Whitelaw Reid. Her
parents died seme years ago. When she
came to New York she visited alternately
her aunt. Mrs. Charles B. Alexander, who
was formerly a Miss Crocker, and Mrs.
Whitelaw Reid. The latter gave a dance
for Miss Crocker last January and vari
ous dinner parties. Mrs. Alexander, who
has been in mourning for the last six
months. Tas unable to do much for her
r.iece in the way of entertaining.
About six weeks ago Miss Crocker re
turned to her home in San Francisco. It
is altogether likely that her marriage will
be celebrated at her home there, though

Elzas was out with the rest of the Her
ald's reportorial staff watching the pass-
Ing of the troops, when along came Mr
Sullivan, the Minister of Railways. Ho
espied "Manny" on the sidewalk and,
thinking it was Minister Wood, beckoned
him to come and take a seat in the car
riage. Nothing, loth, Elzas got Into the
carriage, and in response to the cries of
"Hurrah for Wood!" bowed right and left
to the cheering throng. A couple of hood
lums climbed up over the back of the car
riage during a Jam,' however, and smashed
the counterfeit Wood's hat down over his
eyes. This, part of the proceedings Em
manuel did not like, but when later on
he was Introduced .to . the ; Governor and
drank wine with "a belted Earl" the dis
comfort was lost sight of.

Many delegates were in San Fraaciseo
yesterday and others will arrive to-day.

Colonel Stone, president of the National
League, who will preside over the delib

Clubs, arrived In the city from the south
yesterday. He says preparations have
been made to welcome 2000 delegates. He
1c convinced that the Republican demon

held in California.
Many veterans who have been fleeted
to attend the department encampment of
the Grand Army of the Republic at Sin

proceed from that city to attend the en
campment, on May 1.
The Fourth Congressional District Re

T. L. Carothere of Mendocino County
was In the city yesterday. He will attend
the Templar Conclave and Republican
Convention. Mr. Carothers is on the list
of leading candidates for Congress in the
First. He can always count on the sup
port of Mendocino Republicans and a
strong following from other counties.
When he began to advocate the principles
of protection in Mendocino the county was
classed as the firmest Democratic strong
hold in California. Now the strength of
the political parties in that region is about
evenly balanced, with indications that the
county will give a Republican majority
n*>xt November.

that regard. Miss Crocker is about nine
teen years cf age.
In September last Miss Mary Crocker,
having attained her majority, came into
the possession of her share of hÂ«r father's
estate, which amounted to J4.000.000, and
made her one of the richest young women
in the United States. During her father's
lifetime Miss Mary was his inseparable
companion. He took her with him here,
there and everywhere, on his business
trips as well as his pleasure trips. The
vacations were spent with him at Monte
rey. Castle Crag and other places, and she
was as devoted to him as he was fond of
her.
Miss Crocker Is a tall girl, of rather
slender build, with an expression appar
ently serious at first glance, but quite ani
mated on closer acquaintance. Her face
is rather long and her eyes a bit dreamy.
They droop at the corners, giving a token
of cleverness. Her mouth is small and
sweet. Altogether she is more striking in
appearance than beautiful. She Is unus
ually bright and keen, with a very sunny
and lovable disposition, but at the same
time of pronounced opinions and strong
willâ a natural result of her intimate as
sociation with her father.

OF NEW YORK TO WED
MISS MARY CROCKER
SURPRISE TO FRIENDS
IN SAN FRANCISCO
The news of Miss Crocker's engagement
to Francis Burton Harrison of New York
was a surprise to h?r relatives and friends
In this city. The young lady, accompa
nied by Miss Mary Scott, daughter of
President Henry T. Scott of the Union
Iron Works, went to New York some
months ago after the distribution of the
estate of her father, the late Colonel
Charles F. Crocker, and made her debut
in Gotham society at the residence of Mrs.
Whitelaw Re.d.
The attorney for the executors of the
estate said la*=t night that he knew noth
ing of Miss Crocker's engagement. The
young lady Is still in New York, he said,
and his latest advices from her were to
the effect that she was to sail on the 24th
or 23th inst. with Miss Scott for Europe,
to be gone a year.
TRUST'S AGENT
RUNS BIG BLUFF
AT LOS ANGELES
Herman Heyneman Brings
Southern Tobacco Deal
ers to Time.
Gives Them Fifteen Minutes by the
Watch to Agree to Sell Only
American Tobacco Com
pany's Goods.
"I'll give you just fifteen minutes to
stop the sale of all outside tobacco and
to handle only the goods of the American
Tobacco Company," said Herman Heyne
ir.an of this city as he faced the tobacco
dealers of Los Ar.geles at a meeting in
that city a few days ago. *
Coolly pulling out his watch. Heyne
man noted the time and, laying his time
piece on the table,, proceeded to explain
his position more fully.
"We want you to handle our goods, and
I haven't the time to argue the matter
with you. If you do not agree at once
to do so all that 1 have to say Is that I
have a carload of goods here and thirty
five men employed to sell them. If you
do not agree within fifteen minutes to
handle our goods exclusively I'll set these
men to work and cut prices 50 per cent."
And the bluff worked, according to the
story going the rounds and generally be
lieved in business circles. The dealers
came to time before the fifteen minutes
had expired and entered into an agree
ment to handle exclusively the goods of
the American Tobacco Company, which
Heyneman represents.
Some time Ego the Independent Tobacco
Company was formed in this city by
Messrs. Clisbee and Sellers, embracing six
Eastern manufacturers, with headquar
ters on Battery street. Since then the
trust has been trying to kill out the new
comers. Sellers and Heyneman Have
traveled the coast from Puget Sound to
San Diego, each booming the goods he
iepresented.
At all points the fight has been hot, but
the center was at Los Angeles, and there
Heyneman decided to bring matters to
a head and strike a deathblow at the in
dependent dealers. There is or was an
association in Los Angeles that was
based on an agreement to sell tobacco at
what is known as "the limit." -all mem
bers being bound to maintain rates. This
association was dissolved before Heyne
man left Los Angeles, and Heyneman
Is credited with also having brought that
about. This makes a rate war In the
soi:th easier if it is wanted. After this
Heyneman went to Redondo to rest and
reflect.
This story is generally believed in the
wholesale section of this city. Heyne
man is out of the city. Mr. Clisbee of the
Independent Tobacco Company hasÂ« heard
the story and believes it. but he insists
that he "is still selling goods in Los An
geles. i_-_ ____

cording to the same basis of calculation.
The net profit on : each plantation, at a
most conservative estimate, based on the
present prices of raw sugar, will be about
The two factors that have combined to
make this unprecedented yield have been
the phenomenal growth of cane on irri
gated land, and the perfection of the ma
chinery used In extracting the sugar. The
heaviest yield in previous years on Ewa
plantation has been 1125 tons, on a field
of less than 100 acres, and the average
about ten tons. The average tonnage for
one-fourth of the entire crop this year
thus far has been about twelve tons, while
one field of seventy-nine acres averaged
13 41 tons, the greatest yield in the history,
of the sugar industry.
On Oahu plantation, which was started
by B F DiiUngham. and is a part of the
Oahu Railroad : Company property, the
average yield for one-fourth of the crop
already harvested has been 12.61 tons. This
was taken from 1300 acres of plant cane.
1000 acres of first rattoons and 960 acres of
second rattoons. '"." _ T . - , ,
The sugar mill on Oahu plantation, up
to April 1, had extracted 92 per cent of
first sugars and only 8 per cent of No. 2
grade. Hitherto the best percentage of
first sugars secured In the islands h am
been S2 per cent. This is remarkable, as
72 per cent is considered high grade in
other countries. The polarizations have
also been very high. In first grades 95
degrees has been the average, and in sec
ond grades 83 degrees. This has only been
exceeded in Hawaii by Makaweli planta
tion, on the island of Kaual. owned by
Honolulu and English capitalists.

The gale that delayed the sailing of the

a. m. yesterday it was blowing eixty
miles an hour and at noon seventy miles
an hour at Point Reyes. The steamer
Walla Walla sailed for Puget Sound at 9

such a rush of people to see the depar

scenes took place, mothers bidding fare
well to their sons and wives to their
husbands, while in many Instances little
children were there to wave a good-by to
papa.
When the Thrasher moved out Into the

still refused to disperse but stood on the

THE rush to the rich diggings of
Cape. Nome has begun. The flrst
vessel to get away from this port
for the rich gold fields of Alaska
is the steamer Thrasher, which sailed
yesterday afternoon with 400 passengers
and a full cargo of freight consisting or
supplies for the prospectors. The steamer
Dora started a few hours before the
Thrasher, but owing to .the. stiff north
wester that was blowing at the time,
cast anchor off Sausalito until sundown.:
when she resumed her voyage and i 3 now
well on her way to Puget Sound. "The
steamer Jeanle, also x bound for Nome,
was to have sailed yesterday, but was
held in port by the storm and will not
get away until this afternoon.
The Thrasher- dropped out Into the
stream about 3 p. m., but did not sail
until two hours later. She was well on
her way up the coast when the Dora
passed out through the Golden Gate.
The Dora and Jeanie are to call at Se
attle on the way north, while the
Thrasher is to go direct to Nome, and
every one of her 400 passengers is confi

reach the new El Dorado. The Thrasher
was formerly a steam whaler, and is built
to buck the Ice. Her captain will be able
to take her Into openings that a steel
steamer or a sailing vessel dare not en

the gold fields weeks ahead of other ves

Straits, however, the passengers on the
Thrasher will have a long and dreary
wait ahead of them.

Reuben Hunt. .
The match between the Hardy brothers
In singles was the most Interesting 'and
hard fought of the day. Sumner won the
first set, the final score reading 6â4..6 â 4. . The
second set was won by Sam after a deuce
set. In - which he seemed to have every
thing his own way In the hard points. In
the | third and a final set Sam Hardy lost
speed and was defeated In a love set by
his brother Sumner. The complete score
was: 6â4. 5â 7, 6âo.
The second singles match was between
W.Roth andH. Braely, the former win
ning, 7â 5, 6â4.6 â 4. Both sets were well
fought, but the Stanford men proved the

The doubles was a one-sided affair,
Harry Weihe and Sam Hardy burying
Sumner Hardy and Reuben Hart under
an avalanche of smashes and tfÂ» lw Â«Â«. The
final score -was 6âl, 6â 2. '
STOCKTON WINS
IN AN ERRATIC
GAME OF BALL
TWice the Score Was Tied,
but the Ninth Inning
Told the Tale.
Stockton 9, San Francisco 8.
Every order of heart palpitation excited
the few fanatics who sat on the bleachers
yesterday afternoon and watered a game
that was won out in the ninth inning by
the Stockton team. Twice was the score
tied.
The game belonged to San Francisco at
the start, but the third inning changed the
conditions. In the seventh and eighth in
nings enough fireworks were set off to
rouse the Stockton boys to action. The
winning run of the day was made at the
very last stage of the game. Both pitch
ers were hit freely and there were bunches
of errors.
lit the second inning Hlldebrand was
given first on Babbltfs error and took
second when Levy walked to the initial
bag. both advancing a base on the sacri
fice of Schwartz. Reilly cut the air three
times, but Peeples was not given a chanc*
to do It once, walking to first and filling
the bags. To the great surprise of the
crowd Fitzpatrick rolled out a hit through
Moore, Hildebrand and Levy crossing the
rubber. Brockhoff. swinging the 'stick a
moment later, crowded the bags, but Mc-
Carthy died and no other runs were
Stockton's chance came in the third in
ning after two men were out. Whalen
and McHale rolled out singles and Court
ney followed with a three-bagger, scoring
the runners, but in his anxiety to score
Courtney died at the plate. The score was
then tied.
There was no other change until the
fifth, when Streib rlided to the Initial bag
on a hit. followed by > Moore for a double
to center field, Whalen hit to Reilly, who
juggled, and Streib pedaled the rubber.
McHale swatted out a two-bagger. Bend

This gave Stockton a lead of three runs.
In the seventh Peeples worked off a two
bagger on Whalen.and Fireman Fits, with
the same kind of stick work, scored him.
The eighth was Frisco's inning. Fire
works and errors resulted In scoring
KriiÃ, Hildebrand. Levy and Schwartz.
Hank Harris was happy, for his team led
by a single run. â. , .

evened the score. Ry a succession of hits
and errors the Slouch City men scored

board marked 8-7 in favor of the visitors.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, April 21. ,
ThÂ«* ninth annual intercollegiate
day between Stanford and the Uni
versity of California was held here
this af ternotffi before a crowd oÂ£ 2500
college students. The honors of the day |
went to the wearers of the blue and gold,
who took ten first places. out of a possible
thirteen and closed the meet with a total
of 84 points to their opponent's 33.
Though the day was too cold and windy
for both audience and athletes, Plaw, the
Berkeley weight tosser, succeeded .n
smashing the coast records in the shot
put and hammer throw, while Boyd' the
Stanford pole vaulter. all but cleared the
bar when placed at eleven feet in an at
temut to break the coast record.
The hundred yard dash, the first event
on the programme, resulted in one of the
prettiest races of the day. in which Mc-
Caughern, the freshman sprinter of the
cardinal squad, worsted Drum and Carlo,
gan. Stewart, who took this event last
year was completely outclassed, failing
to make his place in the finals.
The hero of the day was \\ oolsey of the
University of California, who is probably
the best all-round athlete ever seen on the
coast To-day he took 17 points for his
college, which exceeds by two points the
best record of Dole of Stanford made
three years ago.
The 220-yard dash went to Drum, who
was determined to even up the score with
McCaughern of Stanford, who had depriv
ed him of his laurels in the 100-yard dash.
The sensational feature of the day was
the mile run, in which were entered
twelve men. Hamilton of Stanford trailed

SUSPECT TURNER
NOW WANTED FOR
SEVERAL CRIMES
Alameda Officials Think
Him Guilty of Sunol
Burglaries.
>
Sextons Trouble In Store for the Man
Who "Was Arrested for the Theft
of Jewelry at Hay
wards.
Â¦ .
Oakland Office San FrancJaco Call,
111S Broadway. April 2L
Fred Turner, alias Harris, who was cap
tured by Detectives Harper and Sullivan
In San Frar.cisco yesterday. Is believed to
be responsible for a number of burglaries
la the outlying districts of Alameda
County.
The crime for which Turner was ar
rested was the burglary of a residence
at Haywards in September last, when $200
worth of jewelry was stolen. On being
searched fifty-nine pocketknives were
found In the suspect's possession, which
led to an investigation which has con
vinced Deputy Sheriff Striker that Tur
ner Is the thief who broke into J.
Schmidt's store at Sunol on the night of
the ISth inst. and carried away a quan
tity of merchandise, including five dozen
pockctknives. These were purchased
from Miller. Sloss & Scott, and It was
ascertained to-day by communicating
with {he San Francisco authorities that
the knives found on Turner had tags at
tached bearing the name of that firm.
On the same night that Schmidt's store
was looted the saloon of A. Ager at Sunol
was entered by a thief and $6 stolen from
the cash register. The local authorities
ere now convinced that Turner is respon
sible for both these burglaries, as well
us for several others In Berkeley and Ala
meda.
PEDAGOGUES AT
WAR OVER THE
ITEM OF MORALS
Hot Retort Among Teachers
in Controversy About
Ethics for Pupils.
County Educators Decide to Teach
School Children to Differentiate
Right and "Wrong by
. Book.
>
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1113 Broadway, April 21.
Morals and manners are to be taught
In the Alameda County public schools by
rule of three. That school children re
quire training in the ethical side of life
Is the decision of the austere pedagogues
who comprise the County Board of Edu
cation. As if to demonstrate the influence
of example upon the youth under their
control, the schoolmasters worked them
selves into a fever heat to-day in a lively
discussion of the question of Introducing
"morals and" manners" as a part of the
curriculum. The decision to advertise for
text books calculated to assist the teach
ers in inculcating principles of morality,
etiquette and good breeding settled a con
troversy which buzzed like angry bees in
a hive.
County Superintendent T. O. Crawford
opened the skirmish by advocating the
addition of ethics to the course of study.
Principal P. M. Fisher of the Central
High School sprang to his feet in opposi
tion.
"The public Is protesting already
against the course of study," he declared,
"on the ground that children are com
pelled to -work entirely too hard. To crowd
on another item is too much."
"Who is to govern us in this matter â
the public idea or what we believe is best
for the pupil?" demanded Superintendent
Crawford. "Moral development of the
child is more Important than mental
growth. As it is now, ethics are neg
lected. We do not even Inquire concern
ing the character of the teachers to whom
we grant certificates."
."I don't propose to go contrary to the
public view. I will not vote for the propo
sition unless you can drop some study and
use 'ethics' ,as a substitute," declared
Principal Fisher.
"It is not a question of substitution,"
replied the superintendent, "but one of
right, "yen in yo. .â¢ own school, Mr.
Fisher, children are not taught morality
and what is right for them to do. Chil
dren should be taught that it is not right
for them to steal a ride on the cars."
"Children have a keener perception of
what is right than you credit them with,"
asserted Fisher. "They know when they
are doing right and when they are doing
wrong. If you witnessed the scenes in
my office you would not say the children
receive no moral Instruction."
"Yes they are treated like criminals
after they have done wrong," was the re
tort. "That is not what we want. They
should be so taught that they would not
do wrong."
Director Ingler tried to pour oil on the
situation by suggesting that morals and
manners might be taught without the use
of text books. The superintendent main
tained that books were necessary. Fisher
â¢renewed the contest by announcing that
he was satisfied the rules and regulations
required school teachers to inculcate mor
als and manners. A motion to advertise
for bids on text books was carried and the
tilt ended.
First school examinations will be held
at Pleasanton. Irvlngton and San Leandro
May 19 and May 26, second examinations
June 9 and 16. Same dates apply respect
ively to Elmhurst and Frultvale.
The board granted certificates and di
plomas as follows: Grammar gradeâ Miss

RULES FOR FRESHMAN AND
SOPHOMORE CLASS RUSH
<}r=s) ERKELET, April 21.â Rushing has
fe^sbeen legalized at the University of
JL-^'California, and henceforth it is to
be done according to rule. There
are to be referees and judges and a roped
arena, and it is to take place in the day
light under the admonishing eye of the
faculty. The days, or more properly the
nights, of the old-fashioned rush are
gone. The Jolly sophomore and the ter
rible freshmen can no longer engage in
promiscuous struggles under the eyes of
admiring co-eds, and tie each other In
bonds of hemp and Incidentally break
a jaw, arms and legs and necks. Ah
this must now be done according to rule
and at a specified time and place. Every
body in Berkeley is wondering how the
new gcheme will work.
The idea came to President Wheeler a
few weeks ago. There was a sultriness
In the university atmosphere that fore
boded a student storm. It was evident
that a rush was brewing. The freshman
class had posted Its challenges on thf?
hillsides and even upon Goat Island, and
it Is a university tradition that a rush
must come when Goat Island is invaded
by the freshmen. President Wheeler saw
that a rush was Inevitable and he de
cided that it should be done with as few
broken bones as possible. Hence he pro
mulpated a set of rules and designated
Monday next as the date for the rush.
President Wheeler's rushing regulations
are more elaborate than the rules of the
great game of football. Here are some
of them:
1. There shall be three referees governing
the contest. The*" shall be the president
of the senior class, the president of the
Junior class and Professor Mac**, if he
will act. Seniors and Juniors wearing plugs
will act as deputies.
2. The duration of this rush shall not
exceed one hour.
3. A suitable place shall be roped In by
the upper classmen. Within this spa?e only
the participating classmen, Junloiv and
seniors wearing plucs and Professor Magee
shall be allowed. No admission fee shall
be charged to the rush.
4. No one carrying a club, hose or my
other weaoon shall be allowed within the
Inclosed s;>ace.
5. No eclFsors. knives or other cutting in
struments shall be allowed within the in
closed ci>ace.
6. All hitting or "slugging" shall be
prohibited. The contest shall consist solely
of throwing men down and tying them.
7. The referees shall award the victory to
the class which at the end of the hour has
tied up the greater actual number of the
enemy's men.
8. The rush shall begin at 4 p. m. and
end at 5 d. m.
9. The rush shall be begun at the ref
eree's sirnal. It shall be ended by some
signal, such as the firing of guns loud
enough to be heard by all the contestants,
who shall Immediately cease the struggle.
Men tied up after the final signal shall not
be counted. After the final s-innal no man
rhall be untied, either by himself or others,
except by the referees after countinc
10. Any man violating any of thes- rules
shall be Immediately excluded from the
contest.
11. Those men who In Professor Macro's
opinion are unable to enter the rush, and
those men whose parents by communication
to President Wheeler have forbidden them
to rush, shall t>Â» positively debarred. Pen
alty for disobedience to this rule shall be
absolute expulsion from college, from which
there shall be no appeal.
12. Each contestant must wear on his
chest his class colors In a piece not lew
than six inches square.
13. Each claw shall march to the field In
a separate body and the sophomores shall
form on the right of the field in single
rank facing- west, while the freshmen shall
form likewise on the left In a .single rank
facing- east. Both classes must be in their
respective positions by 4 p. m.. and no one
will be allowed to contest who Is not In
position by that time.
14. The entire lower campus shall be
Inclosed by a rope starting from tha south
ernmost end of the track fence and running
along the central walk on the south to a
point opposite the backstop, thence to base
ball bleachers on the east, thence to the
backstop and thence to the track fence on
the north. On the west the track fence
r hall constitute the boundary line.
15. Seniors and Juniors wearing plugs
shall be etatloned at intervals Inside' the
rope; the former on the east and north,
the latter on the west and south. Their
duties shall be to prevent the crowd oorf r
on-lookers from closing in on the con
testants, and they themselves. (I. c., upper
classmen) shall not, nor shall they allow
the spectators to approach within fifty (50)
feet of the whitewashed line which shall
extend around the field parallel to and at
a distance of fifty (50) feet from the rope,
except en the west, where it shall run
parallel to the track fence at a distance of
fifty (E0) feet from It.
IS. The freshmen who are tied up
shall be piled en the east of the field and
the sophomorf s who are bound shall be
plied on the west of the field.
17. This is a contest between 'the
freshman and sophomore classes only, and
no assistance of any kind whatever from
any sourc whatsoever shall be allowed to
be rendered.
18. Anyone who refuses to leave the
field when so requested by a referee shall
be expelled from the university without
appeal.
19. The referees shall bÂ« distinguished
by bltfe and gold badges.

PRESIDENT DOLE
LOSES SUPPORT
OF PETER JONES
Appoints Court of Claims
That Fails to Meet
With Favor.
Honolulu Business Men Declare His
Appointees Incompetent and Coun
cil of State Refuses to Appro
priate Necessary Funds.
Â»
President Dole of Hawaii has succeeded
in making himself unpopular with the
business community of Honolulu by the
arbitrary manner in which he acted in
trying to force upon it a Court of Claims
composed of men whom the merchants
of the city considered utterly Incompetent
to perform the duties devolving upon
them. The affair has led to a rupture
between Dole and his heartiest supporter,
P. C. Jones, millionaire banker and sugar
factor, and perhaps the most influential
political 'man in the islands. At last ac
counts-Jones was hot upon the trail of
the President, and the royalists were
thoroughly enjoying the spectacle.
The Court of Claims was instituted un
der authority from President. McKinley
to examine into and adjust the losses by
fires ordered by the Honolulu Board of
Health for sanitary reasons during the
recent bubonic plague scare in Honolulu.
An immense number of buildings was
burned to the ground, many of them with
their entire contents. Thousands of own
ers are represented, and the property de
stroyed Is variously estimated at from
$4,000,000 to $6,000,000. The five members of
the Court of Claims appointed by Presi
dent Dole were: J. Alfred Magoon, a lo
cal attorney .who married in the Afong
family; Alfred F. Judd Jr., a very young
attorney, just out of college; Louis An
drews, another young attorney but a short
time out of his teens; A. Xoa Kepoikai,
a native lawyer, and George A. Davis,
an attorney who has never particularly
distinguished himself in his law practice.
A business man of Honolulu .who has
considerable at stake in this matter came
up on the Nippon Maru and is now in
this city. In an interview he roundly de
nounced the whole proceeding. "Just be
fore I left Honolulu," he said, "the ap
pointments made by' President Dole on
tho newly created Court of Claims were
turned down by the Chamber of Com
merce. The action of the merchants
through the Chamber of Commerce In dis
approval of the appointees of Dole was
expressed in a strong resolution which
was passed unanimously, but in Dole's re
ply to the resolution he declined to make
any changes in the personnel of the court,
stating that it was necessary. In his opin
ion, that the court should be composed
exclusively of lawyers. The Council of
State made short work of the Court of
Claims by refusing to appropriate any
money for expenses, which was equiva
lent to a vote of want of confidence in the
executive.
"Peter C. JoneÃ, the banker and sugar
factor, who has always been a strong
supporter of Dole, was camping hot upon
the trail of the Cabinet when I left, and
it was understood that on the Monday
following my departure there was to be
some further lively debate in the Council
of State. The seeds of disintegration are
seemingly being sown by the erstwhile
supporters of the Government. It looks
as If Dole will get very scant support in
his aspirations for the Governorship, as
the planter element and many of the mis
sionary contingent are now against him.
"The men named by Dole are utterly
incompetent to deal with - these cases.
What do boys and antiquated lawyers
know of property values? Perhaps it
might be well to have one experienced
lawyer on the board, but the other mem
bers ought to be the most experienced
and level headed men in the community.
International complications are threat
ened over the settlement of the claims,
and it will require tried and true men to
pass upon them. Dole's appointees are
simply Impossible."

except a past noble grand, who, like the
parrot, talked too much and by her voice
gave herself away. Mrs. W. W. Watson,
who appeared in a prettily fashioned ball
dress made of paper, was awarded the
first prize. There were other prizes dis
tributed. After the unmasking dancing
was resumed and refreshments were
served.

cause a yieldl:^ tendency In Iron prices. It
v.as proved, that, viewed simply as a tactical
maneuver, no more effective bear stroke could
be devised thau to arouse doubts over the
soundness of the Iron trade. It brought'a large
volume of securities to market ar.J discouraged
the buying demand even of professional opera
tors, who i-rufess-ed to see clearly the motive
of the whole proceeding and to disparage the
pood faith arid the truthfulness of it. Business
from outside sources dwindled to unimportant
proportions, reflecting the sentiments of doubt
aroused In the minds of the business world.
Even foreign etock markets showed thl9 effect.
It served to counteract effectually all the
favorable factors making for higher prices. It
was the general feeling in WaJl street that
digestion of profits on the late rise In prices
had been pretty well accomplished and the re
action had probably run Its course. A renewed
upward movement was expected and vu In
augurated with some confidence on Monday,
TÂ»hen the break In the metal stocks interrupted
It. There was Borne apprehension that when
the n<*w bank note law begun to operate the
resulting currency expansion would result In
undue speculation. The week's reaction in the
stock market 1c the more notable In view of
the easing condition of the money market under
the effect of the new law. The payment of pre
miums on refunded Government \onds haa con
tributed larrely to replenishing cash of the
banks on sub-treasury operations. Owing to
large pension payments, the Government's sur
plus of revenues for the month thus far haa

reported at New England points and in the
Northwest the payment of loans lÂ« said to he

r!srs of becoming somewhat plethoric, snd the
upward course of sterling exchange and the

NEW YORK. April 21.â The Financier says:
The New Tork bunks are adding steadily to
their surplus despite the expansion In deposits,
an operation that calls for additional reserve.
The statement for the current week shows a
a gain of over $6,000,000 In cash, the result,
primarily, of treasury disbursements, although
considerable, cash came to this center from
the Interior. The Increase In loans was $5,500,
900 and In deposits $5,300,900.
The statement does not balance by the usual
rules for proving, but the result, according to
the published figures, was a gain of about
$4,000,000 in surplus reserve, bringing the total
excebS above $14,000,000. The month of April
60 far has besn marked by handsome increases
in cash, the expansion since the close of March
footing up about $14,000,000. In the same time
loans have increased $25,000,000 and deposits
$35.0u0,0UÂ». Whether the rising loan and deposit
totals will keep pace with the cash gains now
being made is a question the answer to which
will solve the probable range of rates In money
over the sprinc season. As matters stand now
the lov.- rates prevailing encourage an advance
in sterling and the spectacle is presented of a
hardening exchange market in the face of a
credit balance due the country larger than at
any time in itÂ« history'- This is noteworthy so
far as the United Staes is concerned, but It
only goes to Ghow that a condition has been
i^ached where surplus wealth Is seeking higher
Interest rates abroad. The disbursements on
bond premiums by the treasury is adding to the
pressure, but above that a factor which must
be reckoned with Is the inflation which is going
on in national bank issues. Already the na
tional banks have taken out $6.0<X>,000 of a cir
culation above the average, and reliable esti
mates made on the basis of careful official can
vasses indicate that $100,000 of new national
bank money is In contemplation throughout the
United States. This Is not to be issued Immedi
ately, but Its gradual emission will have a
clearly defined effect in assisting gold exports.
The number of clearing-house banks has been
reduced by one during the week, but an in
crease In the capital of anot+ier Institution of
â¢ 'ft Odii. <VK> makeÃ the total clearing-house capital
$72,822,700. As over $60,000,000 of this is national
bank capital the opportunity for new bank cir
culation will be at once apparent. The total
circulation now is $21,400,100.
London Market.
NEW YORK, April 21.â The Commercial Ad
vprtlser'B London financial cablegram says:
There was nothing whatever In the markets
here to-day, and the tone was dull, except In
Americans, which were fairly busy. The only
feature was Baltimore and Ohio, and reflecting
New York prices. Anacondas were down 1 1-18
to 10 1-16. Call money was steady and less
wanted. The considerable sum due the bank
vas repaid and It did not discount business.
Bills were unchanged, but their tone was
weaker. New York exchange reaching the ex
port point.
The bank got Â£5000 gold from Australia and
lost $15,000,000 to Roumania.

COLUMBIA ATHLETIC
CLUB GAINS A POINT
On Its Petition Police Are Temporarily
Restrained From Interfering
With Boxing Exhibitions^
The Columbia Athletic Club has gone
Into court for the purpose of testing the
right of Chief of Police Sullivan to Inter
fere with sparring exhibitions scheduled
to be held in the future under the auspices
of the plaintiff corporation at Woodward's
Pavilion. A temporary injunction was
granted yesterday by Judge Murasky on
the petition of the club restraining the
Chief from interfering with the boxing
exhibition advertised for Tuesday nighr
The writ was made returnable Thursday
at which time the court will determine
whether or not it should be made perma
nent.
Attorney George D. Collins, who repre
sents the petitioner, contended that the
municipal ordinance recently passed to
regulate boxing contests is illegal, and
that such contests are regulated solely by
the State law. The Columbia Club, he
said, had complied with the statutes and
is licensed to give exhibition^ at regular
intervals. *
It is very probable the exhibition sched
uled for Tuesday evening will take place,
unless Chief Sullivan sees fit to risk a
Judgment for contempt of court and on
his own initiative stops the bout.
COUNTRY CRICKETERS
ARE DISSATISFIED
Lakeport and Burns Valley Clubs
Threaten to Break A-way From
the Association.
At a meeting of the California Cricket
Association held Friday evening the fol
lowing were present: Edward Brown
( president), Robert B. Hogue, Henry
Ward, George Theobald, J. J. Moriarty
and Arthur Inkersley. A sanction was
granted the Sacramento Cricket Club to
play a match against the Citrus Colony
Club of Penryn during May. As it Is not
certain whether the California Club,
which won the pennant last year, will
put an eleven in the field during the com
ing season, the final adoption of the
schedule of matches for 1500 was deferred.
The first match of the season. Is set for
May 6.
The main business of the meeting was
the consideration of the letters of the
Lakeport and Burns Valley cricket clubs,
the members of which are dissatisfied
with the association and threaten to
withdraw from it. No city team has vis
ited Lake County for several years, al
though the Lake County men have re
peatedly invited the San Francisco clubs
to play a sÂ«ries of matches there and
have promised them generous hospitality
Further, the country clubs think the
principle upon which the JJurnell prizes
for best batting and bowling averages
In ISO 3 were awarded are unfair and show
unjust discrimination against the coun
try cricketers. George Theobald, Henry
Ward and the secretary of the associa
tion were appointed, a committee to pre
pare a reply, to the communication of the
Lake County clubs. It is probable some
arrangement" will be* made whereby the
country clubs In the association can vote
by mailed proxy on questions in which
they are interested. It is quite certain
that if the association wishes to retain
the distant country clubs it will have to
show itself more disposed to guard their
interests than hertofore.
The Sacramento and Santa Cruz Coun
try Club cricket clubs having joined the
association. - that body will be stronger
than ever before if it can retain the LakÂ»
and Placer county clubs.
fr=HE third annual field day of the
Grammar School Athletic Clubs, par
1 tlcipated In by Crocker. Pacific
* Heights, Hamilton. Hearst and
Clement schools, was held at the Olympic
Club grounds yesterday afternoon and
brought out some excellent athletic
material, pretty girls and a large
crowd of lusty-voiced youngsters. Through
the splendid work of Golcher and Nealon I
the Crocker School won the day with the
high score of 77 points. The representa
tives of the Pacllic Heights School were
second with 2$ points. Hamilton bchool
was third with is points. The Clement and
the Hearst schools managed to score 2 and
1 point, respectively.
Although the day was not an auspicious
one for athletic exercises the attendance
was very good and the sprints were up
to the usual grammar school standard as
to time.
Toung Nealon, son of the ex-Assessor,
was in great form and his mate, Golcher,
a son of the well-known sporting goods
dealer also did great work. Both lads
have a bright future in athletics. In the
eprints they could not be equaled and
their times compare favorably with more
experienced amateurs. Nealon tucked
away the aO-yard dash. won his
heat* in the 100 and was only beaten by a
yard in the final of that event; won the
10-pound shot put and the broad jump.
Golcher' s work was equally as clever. He
won his heat in the 50-yard dash and ran
a close second in the nnal; captured the
100-yard dash and then the pole vault.
The schoolboy was in his element
throughout the day. He overran the rteld
and the officials and practically spoiled
a. good programme.
Following were the scores:
60- yard <lash. record, 6 seconds (By Buhlert,
P H S.):'F*irst beatâ Golcher (Crocker) first,
Woodward <P. H. S.) second. Second heatâ
Vealon < Crocker) first, Schwartz (Clement) sec

the landlord or the tenant can terminate
the occupancy at will. In other words the

the children, share and share alike; that
is, If there is no will. If the second wife

such duties.

hour. The first (Eastern) section includes nl
territory, between thÂ« Atlantic, coast and an ir
regular line drawn from Detroit to Charleston,
SJC.the latter being its'most southern point
ThÂ» second (Central) section", includes all th<
territory between -the last named line and ar
irregular line from . Bismarck, N. D.. to th<
mouth of the Rio Grande. The third (Mountain
section includes ,aIK territory between the. lasj
named line and' nearly the western borders ol
Idaho, -Utah and Arizona. The fourth" ( Pacific;
section covers the rest Â¦Â¦ of Â¦ the country to th<
Pacific coasts Standard time Is uniform lnsidt
of these sections, and the time of each sectior

a. m., and at San Francisco (Pacific time). 9

ington. 13 minutes faster at Charleston. 2S min
utes slower at Detroit, 18 minutes faster at
