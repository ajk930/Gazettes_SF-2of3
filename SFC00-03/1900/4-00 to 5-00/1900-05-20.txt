Welburn did not say the word, however,

The authorities were not slow to Inves

hard to find Welburn among the thou

With his appointment to office, the
friends of the ex-revenue officer declare,

his enemies began to take a venomous
substantiality. After, a term of four
years the charge of embezzlement was
brought against him.r with the result of
an acquittal and Welhurn's subsequent
departure, as stated. In speaking of his
reasons for leaving at that time the ex-
Collector stated on the stand:

nction taken against me. I maintain that
1 was not officially notified, and tberefore

1 had done so I should not have befcn

notoriety given to me by my enemies
through the medium of the newspapers.

nantly, "that the newspaper reports insti
gated by my enemies, and to the effect
that I had been Indicted by the Federal
Grand Jury, were published fully three
months before any indictment was brought
against me."
Having received an honorable discharge
from service In the war at Cuba, Welburn
was mustered out in Texas and after a
time re-enlisted, intending to go to
Manila. This time he was one of tho
Texas Heavy Artillery men and with
them he came to San Francisco to await

fine old Southern family, the branches
of which are represented among the first
families of every State south of the Ohio,
his childish recollections are Interwoven
with historic events â the horrors, of the'
war, the devastating army of Sherman In
the famous march to the sea and the
terror of "refugeeing" from the advanc
ing soldiersâ these are the memories that
crowd out the more natural ones of mar
bles, toy horses and pet animals. With
youth came college honors and the dis
tinction of medals. Of brilliant intellect
and with a particularly marked talent in
logic and eloquence, he graduated from
one of the old universities of the South
with first honors, the youngest of his
class, and carried away the honors of lit
erature and oratory. Later he ..com
pleted a legal course, and was. admitted
to the bar in Dallas. TexV"He did not enter
into the practice of the law, however, but
distinguished himself in the typical Texas
talent of shooting and riding. His supe
rior horsemanship and marksmanship
soon made him famous among, the rang
ers, and he went with a detachment oi
them at the head of a troop "riding the
line" along the Rio Grande from El Paso
to Fort Griffin during the Indian out
breaks in the trouble with the Tonkaway
tribe, also leading a troop during the
trouble on account of the State leasing
land to cattlemen, to quiet the affair. Mr.
Welburn later turned his attention suc
cessfully to business enterprises, and com
ing to California invested an accumulated
fortune In Santa Clara orchards. The
orchardict soon became prominent in Cal
ifornia politics, his oratorical power and
his personal qualities making him a pop
ular "stump" speaker throughout the
State. At the request of the State
Central Committee he accepted the posi

years.

It Is interesting to be told* a. few facts
about colors, as supported by the' chief
designers of shades and frocks. Â¦'Â¦ Fair
people should 'Â¦ always, with few .excep
tions, avoid. blue and pink, and Â¦wear pale
Â¦Â¦yellows, pale greens i and; vivid reds.V The
auburn-haired woman looks well In green,
f and \ many shades of red and terra-cotta,' :
The hat worn with the coat la literally
delicious, for the grapes of which It is
made look good enough to eat. We have
kept pace with the season by displaying
Miss Butler's automobile, though de
signed to take the place of an opera coat,
la made with sleeves. Almost all' the
evening automobiles have ' 6leeves, ' and
small ones at that, but since the evening
eowns are either sleeveless or made with
the sheerest excuse for' sleeves, the coat
f Jeeves do not muss them and stand sentl
'nels against the chill hair.
The velvet Is an indescribable shade of
blue, and is applique with silver, a stun
ning combination. This automobile is de
signed for evening wear. Velvet auto
mobiles, although unknown out here, in
New York are extremely fashionable for
evening wear, and In various designs
have left the regulation opera coat far
behind in the race for popularity.
Automobiles no longer draw a mob.
We've grown acclimated to them, whether
in the shape of a carriage or coat. But
of all the automobile coats that have
strayed so far from . Paris, we've never
seen one like the automobile that is Miss
Butler's pet delight. It is made of velvet.
a decided departure from the cloth ones
that we are accustomed to.
Pretty as any among them is the
white silk net worn In one of the ac
companying photographs. . Two pretty
heads were put together to concoct this
gown, for Lillian Russell helped Miss
Butler design it. The net falls over a
foundation of heavy white satin, pale
pink chrysanthemums giving the splash
of color necessary_to relieve the gown.
It is a gown that speaks for itself, even
in a picture, and needs â¢ no pen to dilate
upon its beauties.
her wake, for she not only haa woÂ»_
stunning gowns on the stage, but off as
well. ;Â°-
Miss Butler's year in New York has
stamped her with tha? smart something
that clings to the New Torker and sets
them creatures apart from the rest of
the dressy world. Miss Butler has
climbed to the top of the ladder with a
hop. skip and jumpi and her salary has
kept pace with her climbing. Not a few
ot her golden, well-earned coins have
crossed the pond and found their way
Into the shops of London and' Paris.
Tempting and chic are the gowns which
crowd her Saratoga,
|j JC the spring my lady's fancy lightly
11 turns to thoughts cf fashion. My lady
does not go a-Maying amid the flow
er* to cull ideas for her spring and
rammer campaign. The fin de siecle
said or matron hies to the theater,
where ehe makes mental notes, and cov
ers her programme with hieroglyphics
that will help the dressmaker copy the
rown worn by some stage favorite.
For the leaders of fashion to-day are
not the society women. Fashion has
taken apartments on the stage, and her
pulse does not show any signs of the
â¢â¢moving" fever. After all. It's very
ratural that actresses should be the
t=alds of honor in Dame Fashion's pro
cession, and that society women should
follow In their footsteps.
Why?
Because actresses not only spend an
â¢cual amount of money on their gowns.
but they give hours of thought to their
costumes. They don't leave it entirely to
the dressmaker. They want something
original and new under the fashionable
run. It won't do to buy a eown like
Mrs. So-and-so's. It must be beautiful,
and above all individual and distinc
tive.
There scarcely lives a woman wno does
rot think that in her the stage has lost
t etar. and along with this delusion they
hue the idea that they can wear the same
g:ownÂ« that Â«Â«ora their stage heroines.
Tou tee a sylphlike creature on the
ttage one night, and a week afterward
you Jostle a caricature of her. who,,
forgetting the difference in asre and
weight, has modeled her gown after the
er.e on the other fide of the footlights.
But whether for good or bad. it is a
fact that many women look to the stage
for the fashions. They can buy a view of
the artists' gowns, though not privileged
to rub elbows with the society woman's.
That's another reason why the â¢ stage
C'Jeen has dethroned the society leader In
the matter of setting the fashions. The
6tagÂ© <jueen has a large following.
One does not usually look to vaudeville
for copyable gxjwns. The costumes of
the vaudeville are. as a rule, too un
conventional to be possible this side of
the footlights. Now and then a vaude
Â¦vtllÂ© artist happens along with a trunk
full of gowns that would make- any wo
man crave their duplication. Mies* Etta
Bctler haa hafl a gxst of elghÂ» follow In
grays and browns, and best of all, pro
viding she is at all good-looking, the
shade known as fiamboise.
Extremely dark people look nicest in
almost every shade of rcse pink, orange,
â¢ i'eep and rich purples, and blood red, but
not scarlet.
Brown-haired folks . can perhaps wear
more colors than any others without com
mitting terrible mistakes, but they
should avoid grays and greens.
Black is by no means universally be
coming, although if properly manipu
lated a black gown is always in good
style and good taste. AH white is beau
tiful, but delightfully extravagant, though
perhaps not more so than pale shades.
Remember that there are exceptions to
every rule, and of course a great deal de
pends upon the color of the eyes and com
plexion, as well a3 upon the shade of the
skin. Taking It all round, one will (Tad
that these suggestions do not exactly tally
with the opinion held by most women who

fl Story of the F r2nc b Revolution.
"Robert Tournay" is a romance of the
French revolution, entertaining and In
teresting, as one expects of a tale whose
hero plays an important part In the stir
rips' events of 17T3. â¢
rtobert Tournay. is the son of a man In
the service of a French nobleman,' and is
in love with the daughter of his father's
master. Fortunately for him. the revo
lution comes In time to partially reverse
the usual order of things in France, and
to make the union of patrician and ple
beian possible. But between tho begin
ning of his love and its successful termi
nation Tournay has to overcome many
obstacles, and to create for himself an
opportunity to gain distinction, which he
at last wins by bravery In battle.

evidently admires Dumas, and holds the
theory that imitation is the best proof of

P.eafirrs of the numerous fin de siecle
rovfls. written in a conventional style
ahnut conventional people and who long
for pcmethirg different will welcome with
dclljrht "The Redemption of David Cor
eon," by' Charles Frtderic GoÂ«s. It Is a
most UUerestlng story, told with a grace
that !s a? charming as It Is unusual.
-Though tht>re is little in the bcok to re
mind *<jne of the period in which the
srejwB are laid â that of ante-bellum days
Â¦ â ihe style ot the story and the develop
ment of its characters are reminiscent of
Hawthorne and writers of the older
school.
As t!;e title of the novel implies the
Ftory told is cr a mcral fall and regenera
tion David Corson is a young Quaker
vho has been brought up In the seclusion
Cf a farm in Ohio. Endowed by nature
with ricat perwonal charms and with the
fir.rr prarcs of the spirit he became a
light 1:: the little community in which he
lives. Trtil he reaches manhood the life
of the yourg man Is singularly pure and
uneventful. Brought up In a colony of
Quakers tvho live in a secluded valley far
distant from th* exciting life of cities
or.ly poftcr.ed echors of the jarring rioises
of the outer world reach him. Assacla
tion with unworldly people and study of
the works of religious writers and mys
tic? help to tester the spiritual in his na
ture Â£.nd to kerp in abeyance the evil.
From Jh'.s' life- of peace there comes a
ruCc awakening: and Corson, with faith
In Ord Kono, leaves home and plunges
Into a career the opposite of that which
he has followed. He slips from bad to
worse and at last runs the pamut of mis
fortune and crime. Apaln. through an in
cident fo f tartlin* that it changes the
cunrnt of bis life and thoughts, he re
covers the faith of' his youth and returns
to his <>:d home to work out the expia
llcn of his sins. '..%>."
One Icterested In the study of the Influ
ence o!7 heredity versus that of environ
ment will lied entertainment in the evo
lution of the characters of David Corson
and of Pepeeta. the woman with whose
fortunes his became woven. David's
father, though talented, had vicious ten
dencies which finally compassed his down
fall and ruin.- Mrs. Corson brought up
David In the belief .that, his father, was
dead and surrounded him with the best
of influences. Yet when he passed be
ycr.d these Influences there 'sprang into
being the evil traits of his father and
these, with almost no opposition, gained
the mastery over the good. In sharp con
trast to David. Pepeeta had passed from
one evil Influence to another, and yet the
nobility of soul which was her birthright
has been kept unspotted.
By a strange anomaly, It Is love for
this r.oble woman which helps drag down
David Corson and sink him more deeply
In the depths of degradation, while Pe-
and Infix the criminal temper and encour
age to almost certain repetition."
The author has some original ideas to
offer upon the question of ; decrease of
crime rather In contradiction to the com
monly accepted theories. He holds that
"civilization Is as effectively thedlscoverer
of crime as she is the sympathetic and In
direct' source of crime. She uncovers
crime as well as breeds It, which is half
the remedy. The secret of criminal
growth is quite as much attributable to
the more intelligent effort and effective
machinery which enlightened society puts
forth toward ferreting out wrongdoing
and bringing the perpetrator to justice, as
in lending her Indirect influences toward
criminal propagation. The defensive
measures cf society gather strength in
proportion to the exigencies that call them
forth. Wherever and in whatever coun
tries these means and methods are em

all things beautiful and spiritual. Fortu

The descriptive work in the book, de
serves an especial word of praise. It
reads as if Dr. Goss had not only an Intel
lectual appreciation of the worth of beau
tiful scenes but also that unaffected love
of nature which is so much a part of the
soul of a writer that it exhales Itself like
perfume of the woods from between the
lines and leaves of his book.
The story Is an interesting one. It is
difficult to define the greatest charm of
tho book and to tell just where' it lies.
Perhaps much of the pleasure which the
book gives comes from the peculiar at
mosphere which a writer creates about
his work, and which, while bring as truly
a part of that p.s personality Is a part Qf
an individual, is as Incapable of des::rip
tlon. so that to"~be appreciated it must hi
fvlt for one's self. (Published by this

4cousins In Germany and I saw them all.
Karla and I had such , good times with
our little German cousins, only so many
of them are named Gretchen we'd get
them mixed up.
In Leipzig I played for. about fifty Amer
ican girls who are there studying music
The only other people were the musical
critics. It was just delightful to play for
all those musical Americans and critics.

Of all the places I have been I love
Switzerland best. Sometimes we shut our
eyes tight and pretend we're there. I'm
sure I'll always remember that scenery.
While In Lucerne we met Sieg
fried Wagner. He said hÂ» had
heard of me. and hoped that I
would grow up to be one of .the greatest
artists. I could not play for him. for wÂ«
had no piano, and besides wo wero all
there to rest. We used to take long wa'.ks
together and he would tell me of hi*

While wÂ» were In Switzerland papa re

paper with a story about my belec a

from a Ion? climb and they called me tha
"Wunder Kind" because I stood It Â»o well.
Everybody laughed at people saying X

was so rosy. Papa and mamma were vary
annoyed because other papers In America
copied It. and people thought I was side

On the steamer coming home there was
a concert given for the benefit of the hoi

and several other artists wero on board
and they each gave a number. I played
twice. We made lots of money, and be

"M. Duramberty," Germaine continued,
in an ill-assured voice, "Spare us. Be
Just. It is your duty." -
"But, I tell you again, I have no in
tention of being hard upon you. You In
sist absolutely upon discussing this busi
ness with mo? Well, Uet us talk it over.
It is only natural, after all, that I should
try to protect my interests, now that Mile

see no reason why I should allow creditors

000 francs, which form my security, with
out making some protest. But with that
reservation, I promise ycu I will be indul

payments will, become due. I will be very
easy in my terms, you understand?" -'
He grasped her left hand. Sho did not
withdraw, it. Her right was still ner
vously rtngcringr the buttons of her bodice
under her cloak. She did not perceive
that Duramberty. in spite of the feverish
desire that agitated him, never lost slight
of that right hand. He touched It with
his lips and caressed It. Germalne sighed
"Let me so, sir. Let me go!"
He obeyed. It was an Instant before sho

"Oh, put It ofT as long as you can, two

"I am either; dealing, with a mad

the more probable to him. 1 for Germaine

Daisy also believed that certain women,
hcra.lds of a new ape . have as a mission
the untrammekd instruction of other wo
men, and for that purpose are better in a
state of celibacy. But her unhappy
youth, icf habit of open-handed chanty,
perhaps, also, the remembrance of the
Protestant hypocrisy 1'rom which she had
formerly ecSTered^ had incuUatod in her
an indulgence lor Fins of the flesh which
6he, personally, had never committed,
had never been umptcd to commit, and
â¢which imrr.ciate so many feeble women
to masculine tyranny:
About 1 o'clock that same nisht Ger
xnair.t's slumber became quite calm, like
that cf a little child. Daisy, who was
now fa.mV.iar with the law governing
euth altack6. paw that it was finished
and wtr.t to b^U. She rose the following
day at 6 o'clock and left her dear Ger
maine to sk-ep until 7. She had to shake
her by the arm to v.ake her. At half
past 8 Germaine gave a lesson in practi
cal chemistry to the oldest pupils. She
devoted the rest of the morning to her
Irnedicu! studies, for she aspired to pass
the examinations of the faculty, so that
the school might have a certificated doc
tor upon its Ptaff. She appeared lucid,
â¢well balanced in tier mind ana almost joy
ful.
After the noonday meal the committee
of management wa.s culled together to
make arrangements for mocrlnfj Imme
diate nc-< esj-iti^s. There was only one day
to elapse Ittfore me <;nd of tne period
fixed by Duramberty for the payment of
the first l&.r.'WU fragcp, tho hall" of the
fresh security. Frederique and Pirnitz
had to admit that they had failed to col
lect the necessary sum. They were even
far from it, for with great uiiflcuity they
had only got together about b2.000 francs.
Free Collejre had not given all the assist
ance to the School of Arts for Women
that thf-y had expected. Mine, Sanz's re-
I sources were ample, but tho employment
of her funds wis rigorously supervised
and decided upon by the donors. Mine.
Sanz had tried to interest the Knglish in
the French undertaking, but t=ho had been
battled by the iJrittsn lndiiTi-rence for
everything not directly affecting the
United K:!:g<lo:n and also by a suspicion
that was almost hatred of a. school man
aged by a l':;ri<ian woman. Still, she had
rr.ar.ago<) to collect ~C'W0. The deficit was
still considerable. The committee was as
ead a.* a. deathbed group. Pirnitz and
FreiJerique *ere of the opinion that the
only thlr.g: to do vvas to wait, to continue
their efforts to increase the sum at their
disposition until M. Duramberty made a
threater.ir ; g move. They would then pro
pose a compromise.
"He will not accept." declared Mile.
Heurleau.
"How do you Ivnow?" asked Daisy.
"Durambrrty is not nn ordinary 'cred
itor, lib debt is his vcnge:mcc, and he
Â¦Rill r.ot let it go."
"In any <a*-e." said Frederique, "he
cannot turn us out by force. If he serves
a. summons upon us we will appeal to the
courts. A trial of that kind wiil last sev
eral months, am! in the meantime we may
have found sufficK'ist nionej"."
"There 1p another solution of the diffi
culty." said MUe. Heurteau, "but none of
you will liiste-M to si"
"To sell ourstlves to the municipality
ar.d the State 1' cried Fredcrique. "Ah!
JCever!"
"Ah:" rer>!le<1 the former teacher, "It
is very evident that you Â«'.<Â» not know the
I'rencii aclmnilstr.itic:i! We should be In
finitely more at peace if we were an offi
cial umleriaklr-s. All that one needs is to
know how to ge-t round the regulations."
Fredcri<:i:e interrupted liÂ»-r, and said,
with a certain severity; that made the
former public school teacher blush:
"Our role is not to learn how to get
round thÂ«' resii-ations. We ought to give
to ot:r pupils the example cf respect for
the lawa that we accept; we cannot,
therefore, accept laws that our conscience
reproves."
The mc-tin? cnrai trÂ» nn end without
any d*-cis-:i<.n having been taken other
than the wailing policy advised by Fred
erique. They v.-ould wait and see what
the future held in store. There was only
one <let>i which tfcpy feared, that owinj? to
M. Durauibcrty. As seion as his represen
tative came they would offer him the
eighty thousand francs. Tho lawyer whom
Ihry consulted on this mutter assured
them thst the tribunals would probably
indorse this olter, and \vould grant a pe
(riod of OmoAa the school in which to free
itself. v
Neither Lea nor Gernjalr.e took any part
In the discussion. Lea. was nervous Hot
custs of color ilred her cheeks from timÂ«
tc '.line, suffusing her pale visage, and her
eyes blazed with fovor. A single idea
haunted her, now that the Bchool was
fee- to face with elcstruction:
"The prison is falling to pieces around
El 1 !"
She was oulte indifferent to all the
eSorts rnado to save the work. Ruin ao
jÂ»carcd inevitable. Nothing would suc
ceed. \joa. felt sure cf it, and the work
would sink.
As for Germaino Eoubize, perfectly calm
after the night of suffering, she listened
lUteritivoly to the debate without takine
part In it. Dal?y. alarmed by her silence
questioned her and asked her opinion
upon several occasions, but she only ob
tained evasive replies.
The rtay was like all other scholastic
days. The young mistresses had decide-d
to continue their daily work no matter
what- dangers might surround them, and
nny one who had visited the school that
Â«Â»:Â¦â¢ and had seen the industrious hiveful
of ix-ec at work would never have believed
It threatf-r.e4 with extinction.
About 7 n"o!ock In the evening, a few
minutes before, supper. Daisy Craggs en
tered GermaSno's roam as usual to go
Â« downstairs v. itli her. She was surprised
rot to find her there. Usually the young
pirl profited from the little leisure before
meals to continue her medical studies.
6ynopsis of Preceding Chapters.
Daisy went to the dining room alone with
out any anxiety.
Tho little one had already gone down,
she thought.
But she only found Mile. Heurteau and
Lea In the dining room when she arrived
there. Then Frederique and Pimitz came
In, and the pupils and assistant mistresses
followed in proups. Daisy Craggs asked
them all if they had sten Germaine. She
then learned that the pretty red haired
girl had been met by several people about
half-past 5, "with her straw hat. her
brown silk cloak and shotsilk parasol,"
In the corridor on the ground floor. She
had crossed the courtyard, with its aca
cias, a few minutes later, going in the
direction of the Rue des Vergers. Daisy
immediately ran to make Inquiries from
the gatekeeper, who told her that Ger
maine had pone out a little before 6
o'clock, very calmly. The gatekeeper *had
bowed to her as she passed, but had not
spoken. Germaine had turned to the right,
toward the Porte du Bas Meudon. Tha
countenance of the Irishwoman, as she
repeated these details to Pirnitz and Fred
erique; was so troubled that her anxiety
was soon shared by everybody. They
could r.ot bring themselves to begin sup
per and tho pupils became uneasy."
"Mile. Germaine has gone away."
This was the whisper that was passed
from lip to lip, with a thrill of curiosity
and dlsmav. Germalne was worshiped by
her pupils. Besides Duyveckc's departure
although explained to the girts as clearly
as possible. liaÂ«l aroused their curiosity
with regard to the lioingp and movements
of their mistresses. Fredcritjue. realizing
tho 4anÂ£er there was in this inopportune
emotion, told the oft'ervoscent younsrster.-s
to sit down, and the mini began. Daisy,
who was dying with anxiety, could not
ont. She rose bcTorp the end, and said to
Pirnitz:
'"I am jroing to drers and go and look
for Gerrr.aine. Something has surely hap
pened to her. Good God: .What can have
happened? I am going."
Pirnitz took her by the arm.
"No. Daisy, you must stop here!"
Â¦ "What <io you mean'.'"
"You iTiust stop here. You have already
caused enough trouble with Germaine.
You must step here!"
"Oh: Pirnitz!"
"It is your duty. The school is the ob
ject or suspicion In the neighborhood. If
you w>rÂ« :-'.?en wanderins about looking
for one cf tlie^ mi^m-sscs what do you
think people would suppose? Besides, you
take aiarni too quickly! There Is nothing
to indicate an accident. Germaine is very
pelf-willtÂ»d. you know, :\r.O cupable of tak
ing :i suJtlen resolution. It is quite prob
able that she has determined to make an
other effort; the day bofnrewe must .pay
in the money, and to appeal once more
to her former professor, l_>r. Bouchardon,
in order to arouye an interest in us."
"Do you think so?" said Daisy," catch
ing at the little hope in this very plausi
ble suggestion.
"As a matter of fact she did think of
it: she rvt*:i sj>oke to me about It. In ad
dition, to try and find her would be. idle.
Believe me, she has probably wailed for
Bouchardon at his house, and may not re
turn before evening."
Dais-y bowed her head, and without re
plying went away and reached the stair
case. The weight of the discipline she
bad accepted seemed heavier to her than
ever as she went up the pteps, already
worn smooth at the edge by the scholars'
feou Could it be possible, that they now
forbade to go in search of her beloved
daughter".'
"Oh, how wicked it 1."! How cruel of
them: 1 have had enough of their school!
It may go to the devil I"
She went into the room of the absentee.
Jocked the door and began to pace to nnd
fro from the window to the bed,- scanning
the courtyard, where twilight was gath
ering, breathing the faint acrid odor that
pervaded the atmosphere, left there by
the red tresses and delicate white skin cf
Germaine.
"But If she has gone to see Bouchar
don what is she doingâ what is she doing
cut so late?"'
She rememlyred her enigmatical atti
tude all day. The little one was certainly
turning over fome project in her mind.
Aftor all. Pirnitz was probably right. Ger
maino must have gone to Bouchardon's.
"But in that case why did she not speak
to me about it?"
Half-past 8. 9 o'clock, half-past 9, rang
out from the school belfry. Night had
come. The pupils were in bed; the build
ing was filled with an immense silence In
that quarter of workshops and communi
ties. A prey to impatience, Daisy returned
to the Katekceper"s lodge. Germaine had
not been s=een. For a moment she was
tempted to go through the gateway, to
penetrate the deep darkness beyond.
"Pirnitz forbade me!"
She retraced her steps, -went across th#
again, slowly remou"nted to
(Jermaine'ss room. There she knelt down
bej-MOe the young girl's bed and wept.
She also. L'ke Lea, like Duyvecke. hnd
felt a few moments before at the thresh
old of the school, the bond that linked her
to the work tensed and .ready to break.
Yet she had not crossed the threshold.
She had returned. Â¦ She only remained
there through helplessness, all her will
power broken, but perfectly indifferent to
the f.itf of the work. Successful or ruined
what did it matter to her? And her besom,
heaving with sobs, her kindly red face
bathed with tears, she could ntot dis
tina-uJsh what It was she 'was weeping
for. whether for her lost friend or for her
sham-rod illusions.
At- that moment Germalne Soubize,
frathrring her little brown silk cloak
st round her shoulders and bosom, wa*
strolling up and down the wide, almost
deserted, sidewalks* of the avenues which
iauiate from the Place de l'Alma toward
the Champs Elysees. As Daisy had
learned, the young girl had left the school
about a quarter to 6 without notifying
any one. In fact, hnd she been asked
where she was going she would have been
embarrassed to reply. A violent Impulse
constrained her to take a step as yet
barely defined in her mind, but trie neces
sity of which appeared irresistible to her.
She went straight to the Duramberty
wcrkhhup. and asked if the manufacturer
could be erert. She was told that he had
left the factory a fev.- moments before.
"Could you tell rneAvhcre he Is at pres
ent?" she said. "I have a very. Important
inr-?5-ape for him." Â¦-
The boy at the door, who was reading a
journal and ajip.irontly was anxious not
to be interrupted any longer, replied, as
he began to rend again: , .
"No. C Hue Francois I."
Germalne thanked the boy and walked
away; at first quickly, then at an easy
pare, toward the Porte due Bas Meudon.
through which she entered Paris. ShÂ«
followed the Sf-ine, crossed the Pont Mira
beau, went rlong the quays toward the
Trocadero and the Place de I'Alma. The
riverside scenery, with Its immense scaf
foldings outlining along Its banks the ex
hibition buildings, caused her to stop sov
er.il tirrcs. The evening promised to bo a
ss>lerdM one. not at all overpoweringly
sultry in spite of the persistent brilliant
sunlight, thanks to a â¢ strong northeast
wind which rippled the surface of the
Seine. Germaine was animated by a curi
ous ardor, by a longing to walk, to talk,
to act. She saw everything, around her.
with accustomed precision ard relief, so
clear was her mind. A single detail an
noyed her. At intervals a keen pain at
the nape of her neck made Itself felt and
v.as followed by a brief dizziness. She did
not trouble about it. however; she had
often suffered the same way after one of
her nervous attacks in the night. .
"He ought to be at home now," she
thought, as she arrived at the PJace de
l'Alma. v
The clock In a workshop at the corner
of the Avenue du Trocadero indicated ten
minutes past 7. She hastened her pace,
went across tho Place, up the Avenue
MontHigne and turned Into the Rue Fran
cois I. No. 6 was a private house, two
stories high, and -of aristocratic appear
ance. The -wrought iron gate., with thick
sheet glass behind and two shining copper
knobs, was closed. '
Germaine rang. v The right half of the
folding gate vibrated" sullenly.' and half
opened. The young girl pushed It open
with an effort and entered the arched hall.
In the gatekeeper'* lodge, furnished as a
rococo salon, a tall footman :Â¦ with side
whiskers looked her over.
"M. Duramberty?" I
"He's not at home."
"Will he return for dinner?"
"No, mademoiselle. Did . mademoiselle
wish to speak to him?" added the lackey,
eoftened by the pretty visage that Ger
malne turned toward him.
"I had something to pny to him. But it
Coes not matter. I will return In a short
time.'.' â¢
"Oh! it will be ouSts useless. ' M. Dur
amberty will not be here. He does not
return from his club until after 11 o'clock
âbetween 11 and midnight If mademoi
selle would like to write a line for
him â -f'
"No, thank you- [ I will write him by
post." ' r
She went away, and when outside the
gate again recommenced the sort of som- :
narabulistlc promenade which she was to
prolong- until far Into the night, with one
idea in her headâ to await the moment
wnen Jude Duramberty would return
from his club.
Many,,people remembered later the girl
with her red hair, the fixed stare of -her
gray-green eyes and automatic walk,
whom they had met in the Avenue Mon
taigne, the Avenue d'Antin, the Avenue
Marceau, the Avenue do I'Alma and in
the cross streets that reunite these ave
nues with one another. Shopkeepers and
concierges, getting a breath of fresh air.
pitting on their doorsteps, had noticed her
several times and had made remarks
about her. She walked along, obstinate
ly fixed In her idea and careless of all re
gards. When the clear sunlight faded and
the ftshen twilight veiled the sky above
the tall stone houses, she suddenly felt
a sensation of extreme lassitude and sat
down upon a bench in the Avenue de
J'AIma. before a Protestant church built
in a gloomy Gothic style. She remained
there a long time, her head aching, vague
ly dreaming. She saw shapeless shadows
move In the gradually deepening obscurity.
She murmured. 'Daisy!" She longed to
have that faithful adopted mother near
iicr. Had the Irish- woman passed thnÂ»
seat of sorrow when Germalne called fo;Â«
her how gladly she would have allowed
herself to be led away by the hand! But
Daisy was weeping at that moment at
the foot of Germaine's bed.
The light of a street lamp suddenly lit
near her made the young girl shudder.
She rubbed her eyes and awoke to a con
sciousness of her project. The noble sweep
and broad sidewalks of the avenue
stretched along under a pure sky In
which the stars were already twinkling.
Rows of lamps outlined it from end to
onrt. Several carriages and rapid victorias
dashed along, carrying men in white ties
and women in Ught-colored cloaks towar.l
the cafes in. the Bois and the Champs
Elysees. Then there was an extraordin
ary silence and lack of movementâ.* si
lence in which tho clock of the Protestant
fhuich told off the rosary of the hours i.nd
the quartersâ 9 o'clock. 10. 10:15. Germaine
njused upon ber bench. A man came and .
Brit by lipr side, a little man of uncertain
age. carefully drcsed. with the suspicious,
furtive air of one seeking shady adven
tures. As she did not move, he made an ;
ntfmpt to draw nearer to her. She arose
nnd walked away quickly. The man d d
not follow her. When she found herself
once more In the Rue Francois I she again
felt perfectly lucid. There was no one In
the street. The facade of Durambet ty'.-Â»
repiclenoc was closed, nnd not a single ray
cf light filtered through the barred and
bolted shutters.
"Has he already arrived?" she asked
herself. _â.
But the footman had told her between
11 o'clock and midn:ght, and it was only
10:30.
Germalne sought out a post nf observa
tion where she could watch for the re
turn of the manufacturer. Two hou?ea
below No. C there was a mews occupying
a big building preceded by a glazed court
yard. The tall, arched doorway of this
courtyard afforded a convenient retreat.
Germaine hid herself in it. The shadow
nf the doorjamb hid her so completely
that two. policemen on patrol passed quite
close without perceiving her.
Then in that tragic moment of watch
fulness, and then only. Germaine was en
tirely conscious of what she was going
to <io. The pain at the' back of her head
no longer tortured her. .A marvelous clear
ness of perception appeared to Hood her
brain. Duramberty was the enemy! Du
ramberty was oppressing the work! Du
ramberty demanded 150.000 francs. Â¦ which
they could not .pay." And v she, Ger
maine. was going to attack the
oppressor of the work face to
face and alone! Ho should yield
or share the fate of all enemies of the
people, the fate of the Burkes and the
ijaventlishes in Daisy Craggs' anecdotes.
A curious thrill of ecstasy, which mado
her oyes fill with tears and made her
tremble In every limb, overcame Germaino
at the thought that she was about" to
overthrow the enemy. Her right hand
under her little brown silk cloak fingered
the nickel-handle of a weapon that she
had slipped Into the opening of her bo<1!co
before leaving the schoolâ In a furtive
visit to the corner of her laboratory,
where she kept her case- of surgical in-
pafn* standin* before her, filled her with
horror. Bhe was silent.
â¢'Well,", asked Duramberty, smiting, "la
It so very difficult what you want to
say? Don't be afraid. You see I am not
a maneater, as your friends claim.'.'
"Monsieur," murmured Germalne with
an effort, "you must not ruin our school."
Duramberty could not conceal the sur
prise this beginning caused him. He had
expected a little more diplomacy.
"The school?" he said. "Oh, that is
what Is troubling you? I have no ill feel
ings toward your school."
"We cannot repay you the 150,000f due
to you, sir. We cannot pay them either
to-day or to-morrow, but If you will have
patience, if you will give us a little time,
you know perfectly well that your money
will be safe. And you are .rich, you make
immense profits. What are a few months'
delay to you with the resources you have
at your command?"
She spoke gently, almost humbly, and
at the same time she realized that this
Â¦was not the way she ought to have
spoken. She felt that the manufacturer,
who was still smiling, did not take her
seriously. As a matter of fact, this busi
ness conversation at such an hour and In
such a place amused him. He even had
to restrain a strong desire to burst out
laughing. Germaine noticed his suppress
ed enjoyment and stopped short.
"You will not wait?"- she asked.
"I don't say that."
"Well; .what do you say?"
He began to laugh openly.
"My dear child, you meet me at mid
night, after I have been to my club and
just as. I am going to bed, to discuss a
business matter with me. I reply, natural
ly, that I cannot bind myself at this mo
ment. I must think the matter over. I
will see. It will all depend"â
"Upon what?"
"Upon many things. Naturally, to have
to deal with a pretty Intermediary like you
disposes me favorably toward .the affair.
Who sent you? Was it Mllo.. Surier?"
Ho left his armchair and came and sat
upon a little stool nearer Germalne. She
drew back.
"No one sent me. No one knows that I
am here."
As she uttered the words, "No one sent
me," he surprised a singular gleam in the
young prirl's green eyes. He examined
her more attentively, from her eyes, with
?t: Charles, are â¢*â¢ not? Yes. I am rifht
ou are a professor at the School of Arts
there. Forgive me. At such an hour, and
with that thick veil, I did not recognise
you at first. Besides, I did not expect â : "
. I know, I understand, sir. The step I
nave taken must appear extraordinary to
you. I came about 7 o'clock and was told
you would not return until very late. "As
It was absolutely necessary that I should
epeak to you to-day I waited."
"You. were quite right, quite right," re
plied Duramberty quickly.
With the eyes of a connoisseur he had
Â¦el zed all the grace and charm of the
young girl's slender figure and attractive.
Irregular features.
â¢ "So you wish to speak to me?" he add
ed, taking her by the arm and leading
her before the door of the mews, where
Â¦he had waited for him. "It Is not very
convenient to go Into my house at pres
ent. My valet de chambre is waiting for
me and, besides, I am not in the habit of
bringing home with me "Well, let me
speak frankly; you would be compro
mised. Have you a few moments to
spare?" ; ? Â¦::
"As many as you please, sir."
The man's hand seemed to burn into
her arm. the words he uttered irritated
her pride, but she remained calm with an
effort of will.
"I must see him alone! I must!" she
thought. Â¦
"Well." said Duramberty, "I have little
bachelor's chambers quite close. In the
Rue la Tremollle. We shall not be dis
turbed there. Shall we go there?"
, "Yes, sir."
She freed her arm without any abrupt
ness and walked along by Duramberty's
side through the - empty streets, where
the silence was only broken by the pas
sage of a few carriages and belated way
farers. They were both silent. A : pro
found calm seemed to have settled on
Germaine's heart. She said to herself:
"An act 'of justiceâ a necessary act â Is
about to be accomplished!"
Silently, and quickening their pace, they
arrived at the Rue la Tremoille, and stop
ped before an apartment house similar to
all those erected in that quarter by build
ing companies. Duramberty rang, drew
behind Germalne and called oyt his name
to the gatekeeper as they passed the
lodge.
. "M. Legrand." â¢
Stopping immediately on the left, under
protÂ«Â«ti you will not telio otir property r
Duramberty looked ber straight in the
face. He saw her visage pale and then
suddenly turn red. Through the thin ailK
cloak he saw her right hand clasp some
thing. Determined to push the adventure
to its "limit," to irritate his strange visit
or to the very utmost and to nnd out
what had really brought her to bis house,
he arose and replied:
"I shall do exactly as I please, Made
moiselle. Let us say. no more about it."
Germaine took his measure with a
glance. She realized confusedly that in
their respective positions, he standing and
Bhe sitting," she would have no advantage
over such a Bolldly built individual. But
despair clouded her brain. She was suf
focating with a mad desire to act. to at
tempt something before fleeing from that
room. She sprang at him with i a leap
like that of a wildcat, clutching with her
left hand at, the opening of his white
waistcoat, while her right, armed with the
lancet, struck blow after blow at random
at the obstacle presented by his robust
Although upon his guard, Duramberty
staggered, so sudden was the attack
While parrying the blows with hl3 right
arm and trying to push Germaine away
with his left he received a little slash In
the neck, and then the point of the In
strument pierced him in the hip Just be
low the belt of hl3 trousers. But al
ready, although ten seconds had scarcely
elapsed, the young girl's strength was ex
hausted. Her armed wrist was gripped m
the manufacturer's firm fingers, ner
shoulder was squee2ed as though in a
vise â she was powerless. â¢
Less than half an hour later Duram
berty walked nervously to and fro across
the room, casting a glance at Germalne
'or uttering a word from time to time.
"Come, my child, don't weep! I assure
you I will not tell anybody about your lit
tle fit of madness. Tell me what I can do
for you." - â¢ . . , .
But she remained silent. He had tried
to slip a bank note in ber hand, but she
had let It fall on the ground. She gave
no answer to any of his questions.
"Well, so much the worse for her, he
said to himself. ' tli . .
The nickeled haft of the lancet glittered
among the tawny fur of the rug, where it
v.-as half burled. Duramberty picked it
up and smiling faintly gave it . to Ger
malne. â¢ , ,
"You are forgetting this." he said.
She was not even conscious cf his irony,
but mechanically slipped the instrument
In her pocket. , â â¢
"Thanks. Please open the door, she
said.
He obeyed. He accompanied her to the
outer door, through the narrow ante
chambei and along the entrance passage,
called to the porter to open, and Germalne
went away without uttering a word.
When she was outside the poor girl be
gan to run through the streets at hap
hazard until she was out of breath. Then
leaning against a wall she burst Into a
flood of tears. -It was about 2 o'clock In
the morning. A sonorous step and tho
whistling of some belated night bird
drawing near terrified her and she recom
menced her mad course. She arrived on
the bank of the Seine, turned back again
and soon came to the bench In the Ave
nue de I'Alma where she had sat some
hours before. She fell upon It again like
a poor wounded animal that had returned
to a familiar retreat In flight.
An ardent longing to be purified seized
her.
But how was she to be purified?
By death? "O.VJ,
The Seine was close at hand. But death
could not efface the pollution of that
night. Only martyrdom, only suffering
for the good cause could wipe out the
stain. The desire for some revo
lutionary action which should en
noble everything, the yearning for a
murder that should be â¢ almost sacrea
seized her, keener and more irresistible
than ever. Not for a moment did she
think of returning to Duramberty's. Bui
coldly and calmly she sought whom she
could Immotate. whose blood should
avenge the outrage she had suffered. Let
â¢her accomplish . the revolutionary deed
first; appeasement to her heart would fol
low! She felt her soul big with murder.
After so many sleepless and foodless
hours the fatigue predisposed her to hal
lucinations. The scenes of her past life
passed before her eyes like tableaux
vivants of a spectacle. She evoked the
pictures in her memory with all the clear
cut precision of reality, without any of
the vagueness or exaggeration of a dream.
Bhe saw the room in the Rue Galande
where she had lived, a little girl. She saw
the fights between her father and mother
among the broken bottles, while drain
ing their alcohol upon the floor. For an
Instant she was again the bad tempered
child -whom Daisy had taken away from
the Sauvetage.de l'Enfance and had
brought to the Avenue de Segur at the.
very moment when she was about to be
cent to a farm In the Creuse.
Tears relieved her heart, so sweet was
the memory of an almost filial love. Then
suddenly she saw herself again with iLady
Mary Jacksonâ hardly eighteen months
ago â reading aloud to the sentimental and
despotic English woman, in whose service,
by a sort of contrast, she had felt her own
anarchical sentiments become stronger.
Sir James Bartlett, the friendâ doubtless
the loverâ of Lady iiary, reappeared
In her mental vision, with his red face
carefully shaven, his bald skull framed In
two artfully plastered locks of colorless
hair. Ah! the abominable couple of ene
mies of the people! How often, when in
Lady Mary's service, how often In looking
at them, in listening to their frightful
sentiments of an egotistical despotism,
she ' had thought, half seriously, half
amused, "How I should like to tie them
together and throw them Into the Seine
like a couple of mad cats! What a pleas
ure it would be! What a laudable deed!"
Then it was only an idle idea, thought
of smilingly without any dream of its pos
sible reality. But now, wounded and dis
honored, a helpless vagabond, sitting uprn
that bench, she really wished she could
garrote them with her own hands and
cast them Into the river." To think that
at that moment they were living, they
were free, that they derived pleasure, just
as a year ago. in uttering infamous bias
phemy about poor wretches and in insult
ing the. poverty stricken!
"I know the old woman still lives In her
entresol In the Rue du Colisee. As for
him, I met him last week *Â»n horseback in
the Champs Elyaees. Ah! If I had them
here "
The fever of murder again quickened
her pulse She no longer 'Suffered from
her pollution, from her solitude. Without
any distinct idea, but restored to hope, the
poor girl rose from her bench and walked
along the avenue toward the Champa
Elysees with a meditative step.
The pallor of dawn was effacing: little
by little the stars in the sky. whose color
was becoming faint and vague. Night
was disappearing like smoke and was
melting in the air that was already glow
ing. The houses, with their windows
hermetically closed to the light, appeared
more distinct, particularly toward the
broken lines of the roofs. Oh! the ex
quisite freshness that she breathed! A
heavy wagon laden with huge stone
blocks shook the street with its rumbling
wheels and the trampling of its five
horses.
Germaine turned the corner of the Ave
nue l'Alma and walked toward the Rond
Point. .
CHAPTER IV.
â¢ That night, tragic for Germaine Soublze.
brought but little peace to most of her
companion?. Its silence and darkness aa
gravated the martyrdom of expectation
for Daisy. But Mile. Heurteau. Fred
erlque and Lea also did not enjoy an
unbroken rest. In fact, only Pirnitz, by
the strong discipline of her will, imposed
upon herself as usual a few hours of light
sleep.
Mile. Heurteau passed the long hours in
drawing up a '-'Project for the Reorgani
zation of the School With the Help of the
Municipality of the State.". M. Duram
berty had asked her to do this in a per
sonal letter to her. â¢She performed the
task In secret, excusing herself to her con
science with the idea that "the report wa3
interesting to draw up. / I am exposing
my own ideas sincerely in It. Besides
when it in finished. I shall be aulte at
liberty to keep it to myself. I have prom
ised nothing. rt Â¦ .
Frederique and Lea went to bed at the
usuaMime. They hardly spoke to one an
other. They had no need of words in
which to communicate their opinion about
Germalne's departure. Germalne had left
them to go after some man. Frederlaue
was overcome with the bitterest distrust.
Another defection, and one of the worst
at the very moment when so many cal
umnies assailed the work! "Oh! the mis
erable tyranny of sex! Will none of us
ever emancipate ourselves from it?"
Germalne's night also reacted upon .Lea
and shocked her; but the egotism of her
smoldering passion regarded everything
from the point of view of how It affected
herself. ."Suppose I were to do as she has
done?" she thought. "It would be very
easy. It only depends upon myself. If I
had left the school with Germaine at this
moment I should be in London. Georg!
My beloved! My husband! I should be
near you! I would watch over you. nurse
you; make you well!"
All her thoughts revolved around this
projectâ to rejoin Georg and nurse him
back to health. For, having no news of
the â¢ Ortsena save Tinka'n novel, and as
she had not dared to write for informa
tion,shevhad gradually come ta identify
Georg. with William Powell.

I can goto him!" She reserved all thÂ»
will shl had left for this event, which Â»{!â¢
realized was close at hand and inevitable
In the meantime, through the open door
between the adjoining rooms the sound ot
a faint cough or the creaking of ired
erique's bed reached her ears.
"Dear Frederique! How dear she Is to
meÂ» How I shall suffer in leaving her.
She related this to herself obstinately;
conpelled herself to believe it. Alas! she
reafized that her sister was no longer thÂ»
Fedt of former times. A sort of logical
rancor was slowly growing In a corner cC
her heart as she thought of the powerful
pioneer who had captured her intelligenco
and will at their very source and had im
posed her doctrines upon her. Lea liact
been withdrawn from a natural Ufa
through Frederique. Like all rebels, she
was almost ready to hate her whom sha
had formerly welcomed. She was terri
fied by her own thoughts, and "jL 0 *
Christian tormented by doubts who mur
murs the prayers of a Pa S3 . ! Â° nate T fÂ£ }",? ''
she repeated continually: tâ¢â¢,, 1 .. lova
her! How noble she Is! Dear Fedl!
The following day brought its custom
ary duties. With the exception of Ger
malne all the mistresses were at their
posts. Kven Daisy, whom Plrnltz had
been to see at dawn, and who had been
recomforted and exhorted to have cour
age, was in her place. Pirnltz a opinion,
like that of Frederique and of Lea. was
that Germalne's absence was due to some
love adventure. Â¦_ ..
"Ah!" cried Daisy, when the apostiÂ©
confided this idea to her; "ah! Germalne
may be with whom she likes if she is
only- alive!" .
Pirnltz authorized her to leave after her
class to make discreet Inquiries outside.
Daisy gave her English lesson from 8 to
9:30, as usual. Then she dressed to go
out. â¢ As she passed before the lodge tha
gatekeeper called to her:
"Miss Craggs!"
She entered the lodge.
"What 13 the matter. LaurentT'
Laurent, a former soldier, who had been
given the post by Mile, de Salnte-Parade,
held out a number of the Matin to the
Irish woman.
"Have you seen this, mademoiselle?
One of your countrymen has been mur
dered in the Champs Elysees!"
He showed her the heading in big let
ters of an article In the middle of the
v third page. Daisy had barely cast a
glance upon the page when she screamed
and ran out of the lodge, carrying the
paper with her. She crossed the court
yard, thrusting aside the pupils who were
coming out to play, and ran to Frede
rique's room. * r: -'-V" ' .. ... , .

This was the news she dreaded trrat

P "Read that! Read that!" said Daisy,
throwing the newspaper to her.
â¢ And Frederique read:
"Latest news. Crime in the Rue du Col
isee. Murder of an Irish lord.
"Five a. m.â At the moment or going to
press news reaches us of an extraordinary
crime committed this mornine about .*
o'clock in the Rue c!u Colisee. almost at
the comer of the Champa Elysees. An
Irish nobleman visiting Paris, Lord Bar
clay, has been mortally wounded with a
surgical instrument by a woman in the
open street. It is too late to verify tha
news and details. The woman has been
arrested. It is believed to be a political
crime Lord Barclay possessing consider
able property in Ireland. According to an
other version love is the motive of tha
murder. The culprit la said to be a young
girl" whom Lord Barclay had outragea
and who has revenged herself. We givo
both versions and the news itself with
every reservation, for. we repeat, the lat*
hour at which it Is brought In renders It
materially Impossible to verify the facts
before the issue of the paper." ' " .
"Well, what has this to do with us?*
atked Frederique, laying down the Journal
upon the table.
"Why, ft !s Germalne! Germalne !"
sobbed Daisy. "Don't you understand?
Lord Barclay is a mere distortion of tha
name of Sir Bartlett. the friend of Lady
Mary Jackson, for whom Germalne acted
as reading companion two years ago.
There is no doubt about It. Lady Mary
lives In the Rue du Colisee. And then the
surgical instrument! Sir James was leav
ing Lady Mary's. I'm sure that it is Uer
maine, as sure as though I had seen It!
Great God! Great God! What will become
of her? What will they do to her? Will
. they execute her?"
"Come. Daisy! Come! Don't lose- your
head. What reason would Germalne navo
for killing an Englishman whom she haa
not seen for a year and a half? H "Â¦
"How do T know? Perhaps he had
abused her formerly, as the paper hints.
Perhaps she still continued her relations
with him. Oh. I don't know! She never
confided In me upon the matter. Never!
Never! And if any one had told me yes
terday that my little Germalne was not
the purest of you I should have called him
a lying scoundrel. Besidesâ" She hesi
tated.
"Well, go on. Daisy.'*
"Well, even If Germalne has committed
such a frightful deed she cannot be held
responsible for it."
"I don't understand."
Daisy took Frederique's hand humbly la
her own.
"Ah, Frederique. you have no weakness.
but have a little pity fdr others â have pity
for us. Germaine is the poor child of un
worthy parents. Is it her fault If alcohol
has deformed and poisoned her parents*
brain? Germaine is so nervous."
"That's not an excuse."
"She is more than nervous. Fedl. Sho
Isâ isâ " and poor Daisy bowed her head
upon Fn>der!que's kneeâ "she Is ill. an In
valid. She has had several hysterical at
tacks quite recently, the very last night
she passed here. Poor daarest! We must
not accuse her!"
"Oh, Daisy." said Frederique. In a tone
cf reproach. "And you kept such a ter
rible secret to vourxel"? You have left
such a dar.jror in our midst, among the*
children we are educating? You have ex
posed the reputation of the school â even
the fate of the v.'orkâ to this catastrophe."
Daisy suddenly let go Frederique's hand.
She rose 'to her feet before the young girl
whose regard reproved her.
"The work? The school? The pupils?
You talk to me of that when Germaine Is
In prison. In peril of her life? Don't you
realize that T would give all your school
and all the schools In the world to save a.
single hair of my dear one's head? Ah!"'
she continued. â¢ waving Frederique away
with a gesture as the pirl tried to ap
proach her, "I have too much regret for
having led Germalne into all this crazy
movement and for having taken part In it
myself! We were both so happy in our
rooms oh the fifth floor In Avenue de Se
gur. with no one to order us about, no one
to impose rules upon ut! I earned my liv
ing; she earned hers. We did a little good
â helped those who were poorer than our
selves. But here in this house, shut up
like a convent, she waÂ« stifled, she who
was made for freedom!"
Frederique-, sad and motionless, allowed
this flood of invective and heart
v.-rung exclamations to escape from the
Irish woman's lips. Thoroughly exhaust
ed Daisy leaned on the foot of the brass
bed and began to sob. Frederique drew
near her. A somewhat disdainful pity
awoke in her heart for this woman whoso
charity she had admired, whom she had
believed capable of noble, disinterested
sentiments, and who showed herself so
feeble and so helplessly chained by or
dinary affections.
"And yet, suppose Lea were taken away
from me as Germaine has been taken
away from her?" she thought, always at
tentive to the criticism of reason. ""What
should I do? No! I should sacrifice Lea!"
She formed a strong resolution in that
moment in case of circumstances that
seemed Improbable and at the same timo
that she was compelled to foresee: "If
Lea leaves me I will not give up the work
to rejoin her. The work before every
Â£he" returned to Daisy, who was still
weeping, her fair gray hair hanging down
each side of her infantile face, wet with
tears.
"Come. Daisy, take courage! T will help
you to save Germalne! I promise you! I
know some one who has great influence
In the Judicial world!"
"Really?" said Daisy, raisins her head
with childish joy. "Ton will really help
me? Oh! how good and strong you are!
You must not pay any attention to what
1 said. I am only an old. mad woman
â¢when Germalne is absent. Still." she con
tinued, after a little pause, "suppose It Is
not Germalne of whom the newspaper
speaks? After all. Germalne is not tho
only one who knows Sfr James, who Is
probably a rake like nil English people
wbo live on the Continent. Let us go
down to the laboratory, shall we? Let U3
see if Germalne's instruments are all
there. I know them; she explained all
about them to me!"
This appeared a pood Idea to Freder
lque. If a dangerous Instrument were
lacking It would prove that Germatnc was
the young woman referred to In the Ma

the room when Frederique suddenly
stopped, and said:

dinary features to the scientist. Ills diag

summoned to combat convinced him ab
solutely of the fact that the condition*
which confronted him were those of thÂ«
mind rather than of the body.
After he had been in attendance upon
the case for a few days he said to her:

The result of this conversation was that
three days later a cablegram was filed at
the Western t'nlcn office in Boston ad

Three days later ths Countess Zolnanyt

THE SUMMER SCORCHER:he line with the soldiers until he fainted
from exhaustion. There were many ilml
lar Instances equally commendable, but
they did not happen to fall under my imr
medlato observation.
. Heroes at San Joan.
. The battle of San Juan was also the oo*
caslon of many acts of most exalted bra
very on the part of officers and men. but
so universal and widespread was the no
ble spirit of emulation that few opportu
nities presented themselves for exhibiting
special acts of Individual heroism.
When tho head of General Shatter's
army approached San Juan their march
for a mile and a quarter, from El Paso to
San Juan River, was by a road command
ed by the Spanish artillery and email
arms, which enabled the enemy to con
centrate upon our troops an exasperating
tire, to which we were unable to reply.
This was one of the most trying positions
In which soldiers could be placed.
The army was moving slowly to thÂ«
front, meeting frequent halts and repeat
ed delays, the enemy's Mauser bullets
and shells from artillery raining upon
them. It was during this march and
while crossing the river and forming In
line that the great bulk of casualties oc
curred.
Where Death Heigned.
They constantly saw their comrades
strlclren down, either killed or wounded.
by missiles which came from an unseen
foe, and yet these .untried American sol
diers braved the ordeal in a manner which
would have done credit to the heroes of a
hundred battles.
Again, when wet, worn and weary they
reached San Juan ridge, from, which the
Spaniards had precipitately fled, they
were met by a scathing fire from the en
emy's second line, which was formed be
tween San Juan and Santiago. Yet, noth
ing daunted, these bravo men, without
ehrinklng a moment from the fire, dug
trenches and erected breastworks, which
by morning were so strong and well ar
ranged as to make their position impreg
nable.
The reader will readily appreciate tha
difficulty of selecting a few out of this
number of brave and determined men, but
without fear of beins charged with par
tiality I can speak cf two officers who fell
at San Juanâ First Lieutenants "William
K. Shipp and William H. Smith of tho
Tenth Cavalry.
Pathos in These Deaths.
All the officers of the regiment werÂ© dis
tinguished In this action, but there Is
something romantically touching about
these two. They entered "West Point to
gether, one from North Carolina and tho
other from Missouri. They werÂ© class
mates and became fast and devoted
friends. " They occupied the tame room
during their entire course, were graduated
together and entered the same regiment,
the Tenth Cavalry. They were devoted
to .their profession, studied together,
worked together and seemed Inseparable.
Ea.cn of . them returned home and was
married to a lady he had known from
childhood. -
Each left a devoted wife and -three- chil
dren at home when with buoyant heart
hÂ© accompanied the regiment to Santiago.
They were Idolized by ( their soldiers, and
I feel confident that when the Spanish war
commenced no two officers In the army
were better equipped to perform valuable
duty than these. Their superb qualities as
accomplished officers werÂ© acknowledged
by all. ,'Â¦: j
How Shlpp and Smith Fell.
"When the struggle opened on July X
none in that brave army advanced to bat
tle with more chivalrous spirit than these
iwo devoted friends.
The advance commenced, the Tenth
Cavalry moved forward, the brave officers
vylngr with, each other to do more than
their duty. The first , position of the
enemy on Kettle Hill was carried, and
without a halt the Americans bravely
charged the intrenchments at San Juan.
Precisely one-half of the ofScer3 of the
Tenth Cavalry sank to the ground be
neath the deadly fire which they encoun
tered, and among them fell these heroes.
Lieutenants Shlpp and Smith. But a few"
minutes Intervened between their deaths
and but a few yards separated them when
they fell.
Each was instantly killed and neither
could have known of the other's death.
That -night their bodies were carried to
the rear and placed side by side by their
soldiers, who bore for them a love which,
none but soldiers fÂ«Â«l. . '
I Strange Ccifccuences.
They were together In life, and hero
they lay., together In. death. The papers
throughout the country published long:
Hst3 of the killed at San Juan, and finally
a Ions list of all those killed In Cuba.
Both Hst3 were alphabetically arranged,
an<> tills made these two names appear
In consecutive order. The end of the year
came and the list of the killed was pub
lished In the annual register of the army.
Here the names were arranged according
to the date of their commission, and here
again the names of these two men. who
were always together In life, were side
by side in the final record of the Govern
ment they had bo well served.

WHENEVER Americans fight one
always sees distinctive acts of
great heroism, but these heroic
acts are so general that It Is
difScult if not Impossible to
epeclfy Individual Instances. If we at
tempt to include all the deserving the
r.ames are very numerous, and If we seek
to avoid this we omit many who are
quite as worthy as the few who are se
lected for special mention.
The history of campaigms shows that
while individual heroic acts are marked
and prominent, yet the most valuable ser
vice is that of officers and men exhibit
ing vim and courage and devotion to duty
side vÂ»y Fide with their comrades, thus en
couraging all to those united efforts so
essential to success. This, which was
very noticeable In Cuba, was if possible
more mnrked in the campaign in the
Philippines.

The Attack on Porac.
Before the attack on and capture of
Porac, September "S, most extravagant
Ftorks haul been circulated in regard to
the great natural strength of the enemy's
position. mnd<Â« stronger by most formida
ble ami slulifuliy constructed defenses.
Fix hundred men of the Ninth Infantry
were ordered to attack the Intrenched
position, extending to the right and left
of the Panta Rita and Porac road. Before
the advance commenced the enemy"s
Ftrong position was in full view, and ev
ery man roalized that with such advan
t.ires sol<!iers equal to Americans could
Flaughtc-r a large percentage of an at
tacking force. And yet they advanced
for J"'*) yards over an open plain, with
the order and precision that is usual with
troops when conducting military maneu
vers in time of peace. Officers and men
ran over the works together, driving the
retreating enemy into and through the
town. The conduct of a'.l was superb, but
Colonel LiFcum and his battalion com
manders. Captains McCaleb and Ander
pnn, being mounted, were most conspicu
ous. Yet with all this there was no act
rt any one man which could be spoken of
<!iÂ«t!nctively as more worthy of com
rr^ndatlcn than many others.
Dang-er Laughed At.
The Fame couM also be said regarding
the several night attacks of the enemy
upon our troop? at Santa Rita and An
pcles. The enemy in large numbers,
Fometlmes as many as 4000 rifles* would
commence a sudden, simultaneous and
most vigorous attack, the points of at
tack bring numerous, and, so far as they
could arrange, being at places where they
wouM be least expected, yet In every in-
Ftance the soldierly qualities of our men
were all that could be desired. Frequent
ly In these attacks an outpost of twenty
or thirty men would find themselves at
tr.cked in front and at times in flank by a
force of fifteen or twenty times their num
ber, ar.d yet without a single exception
cur iren held their ground against these
apraults. ~; 1..V.
I raw what I considered distinctive good
conduct on the part of a few men at
Bamban. Here the enemy's fortifications
were very strong and, as they boasted,
impregnable, but the insurgents were soon
driven out and commenced a disorderly
retreat toward the north. The retreat
was very rapid, but some twenty quick,
active men of our troops broke after them
In a run, outstripping their fellows, and
preyed close upon the large body of re
treating insurgents, presenting a picture
of some twenty of our men actually en
paged in driving two or three Filipino
battalions/ .Â£;;
Swimming Under Fire.
At all Â¦ tlir.es the American soldiers
Formed to regard it a special privilege to
b* allowed to perform any specially dan
gerous work. I recollect it became neces-
Fary for sr-mc men to swim a large river
with a F-R-'ft current, where the railroad
Tras washed away, three miles north of
Tarlac. Humors were rife of insurgent
bnn<is on the north bank, but some twenty
ir.rn fprajg into the water, swam to the
north ban't and worked with axes for
hours toxins tlic night to perform the
necessary snfl Important duty.
Again, .when our tnx>p3 approached
Canilir.g tjjt main body was delayed by a
Gct-p river, but Feeing the enemy retreat-
Ing, my/aids. Lieutenant Frank C. Bolles
anJ ~C. II. Gould, hastened forward, ac
companied by two or three men, and at
tempted the capture of some of the flying
ecczny. Incidents like this were of almost
constant occurrence, and it was these acts
of gallantry which so impressed the In
rurgcr.ts as to render it impossible for
tnc'.r officers to make them stand for a
moment when attacked by our troops.
Two HeroÂ«s.
There were many acts of individual
bravery which did not come under my per
tonaJ observation. They illustrate well
the exit and endurance of the American
coldicr.
One irpeclally noticeable was the swim
ming of the Bagbag River by Privates
Edward White and W. P. Trembly of
Colonel Funston's command, on April '27,
1E>9. These brave soldiers swam the Bag
bag River under fire, landed within twen
ty feet of an insurgent earthwork, and
tied a rope, which they had carried with
ihom. to one of the uprights of the, trench,
r>y means of which rope Colonel Kunston
ind others were enabled to cross the river
>n a raft.
The lirst land battle of the Spanish-
A.merican war was at L'a,s Guaslmas, June
M. 1SD8. Nine hundred men, consisting of
Jctachments of the First ana Tenth Cav
ilry^ and the "Rou^h Riders, had bcicn
anded the preceding day at Daiquiri. On
the evening or the 23d, having been or
dered to the front, they marched nine
miles, bivouacl^ed in a violent tropical
storm, and by 7 the next morning' had
advanced threo miles further and were
confronting a considerable Spanish force
commanded by /Lieutenant General Lin
ares. Vdry few of the MO soldiers had
ever. been under fire, yet nothing could
exceed the enthusiasm with which they
attacked.
Bravery at Las Guasimas.
Sixteen of their number were killed and
fifty-two wounded, yet in no Instance did
l see a soldier halt or falter for a single
moment. It would be! very 'difficult to
pick out any dozen or twenty men as
more worthy of commendation than
many others. : It was a splendid body of
troopers, and all were proud that it was
their privilege to strike the first blow of
the American army upon a foreign shore.
They were all imbued with the highest
spirit of chivalry. They knew the enemy
to be strong and apparently â¢ well In
trenched. They , certainly expected a
warm resistance, but their advance was
us firm and steady as that of the best and
oldest veterans. .'Â¦ -^

PIRATES AND WATER DWELLERS OF THE SOUTH SEAS
It does not follow because two men are
jf the same race that they shall be the
;ame In character, any more than that
:wln brothers shall be of the same nature.
So more does it follow that two tribes of
me race shall closely resemble each other,
[n truth, marked distinction within the
Imits of a race Is a common thine, and
s strikingly displayed in the Filipinos,
imong whose eighty and more tribes, wild
md civilized, a very decided difference in
:haracter is to be seen. Among the sav
lge tribes, for instance, the Igorottes are
lerce and warlike, , the Mangyans are
jeaceable and trusting. There is a sim
lax difference between the civilized tribes,
.he Tagalogs and the VIsayas being nor
nally quiet and peaceable and fighting
>nly under severe'provbcatlon, while the
vlorcs of the south are incorrigibly fierce
ind warlike and at any time quite as
â¢cady'to fight as to eat. They are all
brave enough. The recent war has shown
that the natives of Luzon do not lack
courage. But fighting is not their native
element, as it is that of the Moros, who at
any time woold rather wield the sword
than the spade.
South of Mindanao, the large southern
island of the â¢ Philippine group, there
stretch a number of small islands, of
which the principal one is named Sulu,
and the whole group the Sulu Archipel
ago. These islands Â¦ form a connecting:
link between the Philippines and the great
island of Borneo. Some three . or four
centuries ago, about the time that .the
Spaniards came to the Philippines, a tribe
of Malays made their way from Borneo to
the Sulu Islands, a people so fierce and
warlike In disposition, so bold and daring
in action, that for centuries they defied
the power of Spain and made the Philip
pines a very hot place to hold. These
were not ldolators. They had been con
verted to .Mohammedanism before their
migration, and all attempts of the Span
lards to convert them to Christianity end
ed in the quick martyrdom of the mission
aries. The-rSpanlsh settlers named these
newcomers Moros, or Moors, in distinction
to' Indios, or Indians, the name given by
them to the other 'natives.
The Moros .are, 'born pirates. The sea
seems more their homo than tho Â¦ land.
They fairly t revel In the water, for wher
ever possible they. build" : their houses in
Ae sea., raising j them on . piles sunk' in the
shoal; waters of the coast.. -This mode of
building has been followed In all the Phil
ippine Islands, the houses, even if miles
from tho sea, being built on piles. It
seems to suggest a time when the Malays
were water dwellers.. In truth, a-back
ward elance through time shows us. the
Malay sea rovers setting out on their war
praus to conquer the multitude of islands
in the South Seas and haunting the coasts
so as to be- ready to take to the water
again: at a moment's notice. '
The Moros hate the Christians with all
the fanatical hatred of .the- subjects. ;of
Islam wherever found. They hate In par
ticular the priests and friars, and have
shown ho- mercy to any of those so un
lucky as to fall into 'their hand3. For
that matter they seem to have had-no
use- for. any captives except as corpses or
slaves/Every year, at the setting: In of
thesouthwest monsoon, ."lt p was long their
custom to launch their boats and set off
on' a { piratical expedition to â¢ the - north.
Landing on the const. of the first Island
reached, v they *would>T attack town' and
country alike, usually with success, and
always, with savage cruelty. Captives
were taken . by thousands, and the men
compelled to : harvest their crops for the
benefit of .their captors. This done, the

and carry/Off their women' and children,
the former for the harem, the latter to be
reared as slaves. Their cruel work done,
the savage pirates would take to their
boats and hasten back before the chang

I need hardly say that the Spaniards
did not submit calmly to this state ct af
fairs. They sent many expeditions
against the Moros, but it was like sending
sheep against wolves, and more than one
Spanish force was cut to â¢ pieces. Land
ings were made at. times, and forts were
built even in Sulu itself. But the garrl-"
sons did not remain long.
In -every* case the forts were taken and
their defenders slain, or they were driven
"out- by the indomitable Moros. This re
sult seems remarkable. In view of the
fact- that' the Moros had only swords,
spear3 and. daggers to fight with against
the firearms of the Spaniards.'- A gun was
a rare weapon In. their hands, and It was
rarer stilt when they Â« could use one with
effect! "But " once let . them get within

the public Is not usually slow in respond

occasion she was simply consumed, with
.nrpe'tite and greed. She had been bo
long preparing for this repast! -Did not
the menu Include the most delicious prep
arations that the skill of man could de
vise? It was well worth waiting for and
rtfy lady was simply ravenous. She pre
sented herself without delay. She came
from the provinces, from Germany, from
Unglaml, from the richest and the poor
est quarters of Paris. She rushed pell
rnril, eager, greedy, uncontrollable, for
getting hrr manners in her wild deter
mination to arrive.- . \ ;-\ :'Â¦'-
Well, she arrived, but what a Joke It all
was! There v.as nothing whatever pre
pared, nothing:, nothing, nothing! Not
even the smallest morsel to gratify her for
ihe moment. Chaos, confusibn. the most
Inconceivable disorder greeted her. "We

who had issued the invitation, "but we
have nothins to show you. In a month
ur two you will eee what we can do."
My lady would be Justified in manifest-
Ins a little indignation, but she does not

ever ri'es at mortar. e!i<? is run over by wheelbarrows, she re

Although the expected crowds have not
yet arrived. Paris Is proving: herself ut
terly incapable of managing the increased
traffic. A wilder turmoil than exists
around the grates of the exposition It
would be difficult to Imagine. Yester
day In coming out near the Pont de

rive chez mol, but Impossible; the crowd
was appalling. The tramway presented
the same aspectâ it would be- necessary
to wait an hour or two before finding
a place and as It had commenced to rain
a little a cab was equally out of the Ques

would have been necessary to fight one's

The State headquarters at thÂ© corner o2
tho Avenue de l'Opera and tha Boulevard

cation In Paris. The rooms are furnished
with that new luxury which is so charac
teristic of us. We are always decidedly
parvenu, we Californlans, but perhaps to
try to be anything else would be an un
warranted, affectation. We are. In fact,
"newly arrived." and no doubt It Is better
to remain unaffectedly what we are. How
ever, that docs jr6t prevent our "newness*
from being most inartistic. Our luxury
always suggests a store window-, the lat

an artistic individuality.

Out at the fair grounds the California exhibit nearest comple

Orovllle. I found that gentleman very busy answering ques

the exposition prepared to be inspired. It had been the dream
of years, and my interest amounted to enthusiasm. But let ms
eay that I came away disgusted; my dream died a violent death.
"It Is going to be beautiful," every one says, and undoubtedly
the statement Is true; but at present It is the awfulest mes*
that can possibly be imagined. I am saying to all of my friends:
"Stay away for a good two months." Perhaps by the first of

HOW GREAT GENERALS
HAVE BEEN REWARDED
( Probably the most successful general of any age, from a finan
cial point of view, was the vcelebrated John Churchill. Duke of
Marlborough. For his famous victory at Blenheim alono ho re
ceived the royal manor of Woodstock, upon which Queen Anna
subsequently erected the magnificent Blenheim Palace. At th*
same time the nation's gratitude was expressed In the highly
practical form of a perpetual pension to himself and heirs for
ever of the very respectable sum of Â£4000 per annum. In addi
tion to these splendid gifts, says the Gem. the Duke made soma
tolerably good pickings out of his campaign, as will readily bÂ©
admitted when it Is stated that his widow, the ambitious
"Sarah." to whom he bequeathed only part of his vast fortune.
left behind her at her death the by no means Inconsiderable
sum of upward of Â£3,000.000. The Marlborough "perpetual" pen
sion, it may be added, was actually paid to the great warrior's
descendants right up to the year l.^S4. when it was -commuted
for Â£107.708. Up to this date the nation had paid the Churchill
family the very respectable sum of Â£7SO,009, exclusive altogether
of Interest.
Although his monetary "pickings." beinsr strictly legitimate.
werÂ« of considerably less value than those of his illustri
ous predecessor, the Duke of Wellington
had nevertheless but little to complain of
In the rewards showered upon him by a
grateful country. Beglnmns with Tala-
' vera. for v.-htch h* received a "three-lite"
annuity of Â£2000, ho subsequently had an
Â¦mmWMBBm additional Â£2000 tacked on to the first for
AÂ» the distinguished services which , termi
nated with the stormlns of Cludad Rod-
r!go. Â¦
In the same year, also (1S12) a further
annuity of Â£1000 was voted. In order that
he might more becomingly, sustain the
dukedom of Wellington, to which he had been raised from plain
Arthur Wellesley, as another recognition of his services. .This
pension was, however, commuted for a lump sum of JCmC00;
while the final grant of Â£200.000, voted for the victory of Water
loo, closed the mutually satisfactory account between tho gal
lant Duke and the land for which he had achieved so much.
Sir Colin Campbell, .'although the hero of many splendid
achievements in the Peninsular, Walchercn. . Demerara. ChJna.
Sikh and Crimean wars, Is best remembered In British hearts
in connection with h?s magnificent conduct of the campaign
arising out of the Indian mutiny." For his brilliant nervices dur
ing those stirring times Sir Colin received a peerage as Lord
Clyde and a pension of Â£2000 per annum. Ills career is mora
worthy of our admiration in that it was entirely self-made, the
gallant Sir Colin being- neither of good family nor possessed of
the initial advantages of a good^ education.
For his capture of Magdala and the consequent termination of
the Abyssinian war on April 13, 1S68, General Sir Robert Napier
was awarded the stereotyped Â£2000 per annum, and received In
addition the double dignity of a field marshalshlp and the titla
of Lord Napier of Magdala.
Of late,' however, the life pensions have dropped out of favor.
For instance, the present commander In chief. Lord Wolseley,
received: a" grant of Â£25.000 only for his successful conduct of
the Ashantee campaign of 1S73-74. while fcr the Egyptian cam
paign of 18S2 and the Nile expedition of 1S94 he received a peer
age and a viscountcy, respectively. Similarly, Sir Herbert Kitch
ener emerged from the shambles of Omdurman with the title of.
Lord Kitchener of Khartoum and a debated grant of Â£25,000.

miles of the Canadian boundary line.
Here American goods could be brought for

10HAXX CAINE has been giving
sittings for a bust all during
the -winter, that is to say,
from November, 1899, onward, to
Joseph W. S-wynrrerton, an English
sculptor u-hese studio is at 2 Via
Montebello, Borne. The bust has now
been completed and translated into
marble. Before Hr. Sinyaiierton sat
aut xrith it for London in order to se
cure it a place in th.e Academy he
complied with a request which. Hall
Caine had made on my behalf and
had a photograph of the bust taken.
In it you will see not so much a
striking head, â¢which has lent itself
so easily and so frequently, though
so involuntarily, to the reproductions
of publicity, the facile portraiture of
world- wide notoristy, as the more
striking and precious bust of the
artificer of "Xhe Christian," " "The
Bondman," "The Manxman" and
othtr works. In , a word, not the
mannered representation, but the pic
tured soul living in the truth of the
body; not the material representa
tion of the camera, but an artist's
:onsummate divination.^
It has been nqticcd^or; it may bs
pointed out, that -tb^pe*:is a three
fold resemblance intbeface and head
of the popular novelist; a special re
semblance to Shakespeare in the up
per part of the face, a special resem
blance to the' traditional Christ of
paintingâ notably the Hussian type
âin the lower part of tbe face, and
a general resemblance to each in the
whole face. Hall Caine's hair r is
auburn; his beard and mustache are
reddish.
But the present bust, which many
Americans will admire this coming
season in London, is not simply this.
It is a revelation of the author and
thinker to himsslf, I may say, first
and foremost, since I heard him say
after looking at it long: "I see my

mentioned is. so to speak, put to the
test, whose fame is ever . glowing in
the very crucible.
I call the bust a revelation because
of . the way in which it reveals the
n:an. Let me explain in what way
chiefly: I was seeking; his advice
once, on his earlier visit to Rome in
1898, about an historical . question,
some new documents of which I had
brought to light. I intended to use
them so. Was I rightly inspired?
"What would be ideal," he said, in
answer, "would be to lay stress upon
the human element, to search for it,
to seize it, to bring out whatever is
human. That it is which tells." Ha
is essentially the human novelist
through all the range o? his idealsâ
of the picturesque, the powerful, the
terrible, the sweetâ especially the
sweet.
The best portrait of him, that
which is prefixed to "The Bondman,"
is half hidden in shadow by reason
of the masterful forehead. Here.it *
is not so. Light falls upon the face,
just as light is in the face, and the
eyes peer into some human fact or
some human mystery. It is the hn

ATTEMPT TO DESTROY
BRITISH FORTIFICATIONS
CHICAGO. May - 13.â A special to the
Times-Herald from Vancouver. B. C.
says: Fenian sympathizers with the Boers
have made an attempt to blow up the
British fortifications at Esquimau. The
big naval docks, where $70,000,000 damage
could have been done, were the objective
point of the leaders In the plot, who barely
escaped from the guard with their lives.
Major Bennett of the Duke of Con
naUght's Own Rifles made a statement of
the circumstances to-day. Â¦ He says that
three weeks ago the officer commanding
at the Esqulmalt forts was advised to
look out for the possibility of a Fenian
outrage. The Information came from the
military authorities at San Francisco and
with it the description of three well
known Fenians, who were a few da>-3
later recognized at Vancouver.
Orders were given to the sentries to
shoot after the failure to reply to*a second
challenge and to . shoot to kllL On
Wednesday night Just at midnight four
men were discovered by the sentries with
in the' line of the first outposts and they
were Just abreast of the Fort Macaulay
Â¦works and within a. short distance of thÂ©
large docks of the North Pacific squadron
and two guards challenged almost ; almal-
taneously. There was no response and the
dimly outlined figures crouched to the
ground. â¢ ., Â¦ .â¢ '
The guards challenged again, and at
this several other ' sentries Immediately
Sred. By the time a search party had
been formed there was much confusion,
and the men succeeded In running past
the latter outposts. The guards have been
doubled. .

BOER DELEGATES MAY
BE OFFICIALLY RECEIVED
WASHINGTON. May Â».â ThÂ« creden
tials of the Boer delegates now In Wash
ington will be submitted to the Secretary
of State on Monday next. Colonel
O'Belrne called at the State Department
this afternoon and arranged with Secre
tary .Hay that the Boer credential should
be submitted tn advanc* of the presenta
tion of the gentlemen themselves. This
Is in accordance with the usual cours*
governing the presentation of. foreign
Ministers. So Mr. O'Belrne. the private
secretary of the delegation. Is expected, to
bring the credentials to the State Depart
ment on Monday, where they will be sub
mitted fcr the careful examination of thÂ©
department, which does not at present
know anything of their character.
It was made evident to Colonel O'Belma
that the Stare Department Is disposed to
treat the Boer delegates with absolute,
fairness and that their credentials conse
quently are to be considered on their
merits. It Is by no means & foregone con
clusion thatftthe delegates are to> be de
nied official recognition.
That was the first decision, and It may.
after all. be the outcome. But It Is said
that much depends upon the character oi
the credentials and also upon the attlroda
of the delegates themselves. I: Is said
among certain, officials of the State De
partment that If the Government should
consider It necessary to cast abont for m.
warrant for accepting the Boers officially
it might turn to the convention of 13S4 be
tween Great Britain and thÂ« Transvaal
and declare that la * ' that docu
ment Is by Implication to be foend
a renunciation of Great Britain's
s-ozerainty. and' consequently therÂ« no
longer exists any prohibition epea
other nations In - the dealings wtta
the Boer republicsâ at least to the extent
of offering official recognition to their
diplomatic representatives. The fact that
consideration has been given at all to this
phase of the matter zsay be regarded as
signlScant of the fact that at present the
administration holds itself tn a receptive
state as far as the credentials are con
cerned, and is disposed to consider Â»*^m
on their merits.

LONDON. May 19.â "However much
Turkey may wrong the United States,
American ships are not to pass the straits

Thi6 is the deduction drawn by the

which deals with the alleged hatred of
America .by the Continental powers, es
pecially Russia.
"The main cause of this," continues the
Spectator, "no doubt Is the enormous re
sources of the people of the United States
and the willingness the people have re

for forcible expansion of trade and terri
tory. The statesmen of Europe do not
exactly know what course America will
pursue In her new greatness, and, besides
recognizing clearly that she is stronger
than any single state on the Continent,
they doubt in their hearts whether if all
who speak English stood together it would
be possible for any coalition, even if it
covered all the other civilized states, to
raise up sufficient obstacles to American
designs. They cannot conceive that euch
a mass of power can ever be used but for

BERLIN. May 19.â The United States

informed the representative of the As

Denial of a Report JThat Deeds Have
CITY OF MEXICO, May 19.-Inquiries
have been received here regarding the al
leged finding In the records of the Mexi
can Government of the title deeds of the
Algodon land grant, situated in the terri
tory formerly belonging to Mexico. It is
presumed that the estate referred to is
that of which the correct name is Algo
<Jor.es, situated partly in Upper and part
ly in Lower- California. Careful inquiries
made in the Department of Foreign Re.
latlons and the Department of Fomento
elicited the information that no steps
have been taken there of late with- regard
to a search for the title deeds of any
property known as Alsodon, or Algo
doncs, and that no euch deeds have been
found.
Algodones grant in Lower California
was sold pome years ago bv the Depart
ment of Finance to Don Guillermo An
drade, who received full and valid title
from the Government. The reason why
these lands were sold by the Finance De
partment rather than by the Department
of Fomento is that they caipe into pos
session of the former either through de
fault in the payment of taxes or through
having been the property belonging to an
ecclesiastical corporation.
. It is said that the sum Involved In the
Algodones .grant situated In the United
States is $6,000,000. Repeatedly officials of
the Mexican Government receive inquir
ies from the United States with regard
to title deeds to lands situated in the ter
ritory that formerly belonged to this
country. There is. no Question that a
nurabcr of such deeds are to be found in
the records of the Government, in some
cases in th*Â» archives General de la Xa
clon and others in the records of the De
partment of Fomento.
When the cuestion of land titles In
Texas. New Mexico and California was
being adjudicated it Is considered strange
that fuller Investigation was not made of
the records in Mexico, for had this been
done ampler justice might have been ren
dered in many cases. The Mexican Gov
ernment probably would not refuse to
throw open its records for Inspection by
authorized persons or representatives of
legitimate interests. Under present con
ditions when the Minister of Fomento re
ceives inquiry from the States as to where
such and such- title deeds exist In the
records of his department, he as a rule
courteously but briefly replies in the af
firmative or negative, as the case may
be, but without supplying further Infor
mation, as naturally he has no means of
knowing whether such information as he
might pive would be furthering wholly
unworthy ends.

Correspondence, of the Associated Press.
MANILA, P. I., A&ril 8.â With the ap
proach of this year's hot weather, which
comes to Manila every April, May and
June, the vessels of the United States
navy have been slipping away to the
cooler ports of China and Japan. It Is
a mighty pleasant thing to thus get away
from the Philippines during the heat of
summer and such a change for three
months will greatly benefit the whole
ship's company. This consideration of the
health-of rhls men was a strong factor in
deciding Admiral "Watson to order several
of the ships from this station to spend
the summer between Yokohama and
Hongkong.
It is a pity the army cannot get this
change. Persistent work tells on a man
out here and we Americans have not yet
learned the -Oriental habits of slowness
In business and naps during the heat of
the day. It is estimated that on an aver
age the American out here does one-half
of the work he would do at home under
the same circumstances and every one
knows it is just twice as hard to ac
complish this half. Army officers can
only get titfs change to the cooler and
even cold climate of China and Japan Dy
obtaining sick leave, but it comes to
many of our naval officers as a part of
their duties.
, The final examinations of the cadets of
the Naval Academy class of 1899 will be
held on the Brooklyn this month at Yo
kohama. This is a great disappointment
to the cadets; it prevents their return
home and in many casea will result in the
adding of three y.ears more sea service in
the Philippines to the one or two years
they have already served out here. Tho
return to Annapolis after the first two
years at sea following their departure
from the academy is always a most pleas
ant incident in the lives of our younir
naval officers. It is a class reunion iu
the alma mater after two years of travel
and duty in new parts of the world.
The life at Annapolis while they are
preparing for the final examinations has
in it an element of freedom and Independ
ence In more or less contrast to their
formejr days there, and as the examina
tions themselves are not difficult to a man
who has not wasted his two years' ap
prenticeship the return to the academy
is unattended by any unpleasant features,
but is replete, with many most pleasant
and enjoyable ones. It also means a visit
to family and friends. All this is denied
the class of 1S91>, it being inexpedient to
return those who are on this station to
Annapolis for their finals, and they will
begin their three years' cruise following
the final examinations without the chance
of getting home.- :-~c.' -
\ An Uncharted Harbor.
The Baltimore starts home from Yoko
hama and the Yosemlte returns to Guam,
stopping first one week in Manila. The
rest of the fleet, the Oregon, Brooklyn.
Newark, New Orleans and Concord, will
then begin a cruise down Japan to China,
stopping about ten days at Kobe, Naga
saki, Shanghai r and Hongkong. -Other
ports may be visited on this cruise, but
they have not yet been announced. |
The Baltimore has just completed the
circumnavigation of Luzon Island and is
now on her way to Hongkong. While on
the eastern coast of Luzon the Baltimore
made a careful survey of Casiguran
Sound and Bay, which to the navy Is a
locality of considerable present Interest
and possible future value. Here our navy
has discovered, practically, a splendid and
sheltered harbor, where the Spanish
charts gave no indication of such a refuge.
Last summer the Wheeling steamed
Into Casiguran Sound and found at its
head a well protected and large bay wjth
deep water. The Wheeling's examination
of this new find was cursory only, as she
had other duties to attend to at the time,
but the reports of Its existence so Inter
ested Admiral Watson that he later de
tailed the Charleston to proceed thither
and make a careful survey of the place.
This the Charleston did, and it was while
the ill-fated vessel was returning from
this trip that she ran on the rocks near
Camaguin Island and was lost. The sur
vey of Casiguran Bay. prepared by her
officers, was not saved. So we were still
without details as to Casiguran Bay. Be
fore sailing for home Admiral Watson
wanted this information, so about
weeks ago the Baltimore was sent around
Luzon with, instructions to examine and
report upon tho newly discovered harbor.
She found the sound to be about nine
miles long, from Cape Telefonso on the
sea side into the narrow passage leading
to the Inner bay. This sound is from six
to two miles broad and has very' deep
water its entire length. Its general direc
tion is northwesterly from the coast line.
The passage into the inner . bay is 1200
vards wide, with deep water up to the
shores. A ship like the Baltimore could
tie up at the shore and reach land with
a gangplank. The inner bay is three and
two-tenth miles long and twojind a^half
miles wide. Its general depth is fifteen
fathoms and the anchorage Is all that
could be desired. The' surrounding hills
protect the vesselB anchored in this bay
from any winds that blow^ and when one
; Is afloat upon Its -waters the. bay , has the
appearance of a land-locked lake. . An<
the best- of the Spanish charts gave not
the slightest intimation that such a pay
1 existed* . The Spaniards, it la asserted,
were' very poor chart makers. -There is
an island in Lingayen Gulf which is down
on the charts of the Spaniards in a posi
tion a mile and a quarter from its rightful
place. :
Adventure With Natives.
1 Caslguran Bay and Gulf were, carefully
examinedby officers of the Baltimore. It
was learned that the west side of the bay
" showed a small shoal and that there Js
Â¦ a reef; visible In Â¦ the day time, at th
' Cape â¢ Telelf onso or northern entrance to
I the sound. Otherwise there Is deep water
' everywhere In bay and SU"-
J ' The Baltimore held some little commu
nication with the natives on shore while
> : inside the bay. One day a canoe or raft
> was- seen approaching from the land.; It
â¢ came along very slowly, because the men
â¢ who propelled it "stopped every xthree

HARBOR FOUND
ON THE EASTERN
COAST OF LUZON
Copyrighted. 1900, by the Associated Press.
LONDON, May 19.â Mafeklng, the splen
did stand of its heroic defenders and
their timely relief formed the sole topib
of conversation here, the other events of
the week being entirely swept out of the
memory of the people of England. In
fact, they have well nigh forgotten Lord
Roberts and the main objective of the
war so overwhelming Is their rejoicing
over the deliverance of the garrison of
the little African village. Neither Klm
berley nor Ladysmit'a appealed to their
symapthies as did Mafeking, and it will
probably be days before the country will
settle down to a sober appreciation of the
struggle still going on on the African
plains and which still presents " serious
military problems.
The successful turn that affairs have
taken In South Africa is most fortu
nate for Lord Salisbury, as his weakest
point, his foreign administration, has
threatened to become an all too prominent
topic. The news that Russia had secured
a cbal depot in Korea, as announced May
13 in a dispatch to the Times from Peking,
has raised a storm of indignation and
many of the Conservative organs have de
clared this is merely another unfortunate
instance of the Premier's utter incapabil
ity to protect British interests in the Far
East. Among those who study Chinese
questions the belief obtains that Russia's
latest move is a direct breach of contract
with a blow against Great Britain and
Japan, which brings these nations face to
face with a grave crisis which pusillani
mous diplomacy will neither end nor
mend.
Advocates War.
The Globe, for instance, .openly advo
cates immediately sending a powerful
fleet to Korea and bluntly demanding that
Russia forego the advantages she is al
leged to have secured in contravention of
th.e afrreements of 1881. However, though
the important organs are in a l>ad humor
over the matter It is said on good au
thority that Lord Salisbury has much too
keen an appreciation of Great Britain's
present troubles to take any alarming
action in the immediate future and that
he only contemplates diplomatic inquiries
and passive aid to Japan in the protests
she will doubtless make.
The Secretary of State for India, Lord
George Hamilton, has granted the Asso
ciated Press permission to inspect the un
published official correspondence received
up to date in his department dealing with
the Indian famine. The mass of reports
that came in by the last mail alone almost
baffle any condensation. Yet now and
again there is revealed by reason of the
very strength of terse verbiage and offi
cial reticence a wealth of pathos and a
world of suffering- which columns of vivid
description could scarcely convey. What,
for instance, could better tell the tale of
sorrow than the following report of the
Cpmmission of Kherwera, in Rajpootana.
With careful regard for the regulation
governing communications he abruptly
commences:
Kherwera-Crops, practically nil.
Waterâ Hardly any.
Cattleâ All dead.
Fodder â None.
People â Thriftless clans, dead; people with
email means, at end of their resources and
either on relief works, or dying.
Crimeâ Abnormal.
With a pathetic frankness found in few
of these grewsome documents ho con
tinues:
I have tried to keep the Kherwera bazaar
open to all, but as I have only 6000 rupees, lent
mo bj. the Merwar at Dabar, with which to pur
chase grain, I- have miserably failed, and "hun
dreds oome to me dally for permission to buy
and have to be refused.
From all the Commissioners of the na
tive States the same story goes up. There
the distress and suffering is more severe
than in any other part of India, yet the
native States, by virtue of the constitu
tion, are dependent upon the British re
lief system and are not entitled to a share
of Government charity, as they pay no
taxes for imperial support. However, Sir
Charles Bernard, head of the Indian Office
Bureau of Revenue, tells the Associated
Press that the British are advancing loan*
to these States wherever feasible and says
they will come in for their full share of
the relief sent from the United States.
Terrible Mortality.
From those Commissioners of native
States who are only able to advise instead
of ordering the native officials come most
distressing reports as to the conditions,
of their territories not yet hinted at in
the English newspapers. One residetit of
Rajpootana reports that the Dewan of
Slrhoi State, with a population of 186,000
tells him that only 148 persons died of
starvation In March.
In the course of a cheery report the res
ident of Western Rajpootana expresses re
gret that he is obliged to record 3667
deaths as occurring in the famine camps,
hospitals and poornouses In the compara
tively small State of Marwar during
March, while another resident supple
ments this ghastly record of wholesale
mortality by remarking that at Dhaulera,
out of 30,000 persons congregated around
the relief works, 1719 have died between
February 23 and March 25, and this has no
bearing on the inroads of the plague or
cholera. From the latter cause 671 died at
Naghpoore during March.
Captain Grant, on famine duty at Mar
war, reports that the majority of fatal
ities were not preceded by any acute ill
ness.

QUIT WHITE BREAD.
Could Not Get Strength From It.
An Episcopalian minister of Ellen-
ville. N. Y, who is interested not only
in the spiritual welfare of his congre-
gation, but in their physical well-beinn
also, says: "I can now do an immense
amount of work and feel no fatigue, for
1 tie reason that I am using Grape-Nuts
breakfast food and have quit coffee en-
tirely and axn using Postum Food Cof-
fee.
"Myself and family are all greatly im-
proved in healtth. We have lareely
abandoned the use of white bread. Up-
vard of twenty-five persons have
I changed their diet, on my recommenda-
tion. It is gladly given, because I
know, from personal experience,
whereof I fpeak."
It is a well -known fact that white
bread is almost entirely composed of
starch and this is difficult of digestion
lÂ»y many people, particularly those who
have weak intestinal digestion. The re-
sult of the use of much white bread is
a lark of brain and nervous power to do
mental work, and it also creates intes-
tinal troubles, because the excess of
starch ferments in the intestines and
makes the conditions right for the
growth of microbes; whereas Grape-
Nuts breakfast food contains the needed
starch, but in a predigested form. That
is. it is transformed into grape sugar in
the process of. manufacture, and deliv-
ered in the packages, ready cooked, and
in such shape that it is immediately as-
fimilated without hard work of the
digestive organs.
. The food also contains the delicate
1 nicies of phosphate of potash which.
Coined with albumen, is used by na-
:o make the gray matter that must

order to give strength and ability to

The Congo Free State 13 Inquiring Into
the advisability of introducing horseless
wagons to carry freight In thickly settled
regions where white settlements have
been built and the water courses are not
navigable. Tho French have already
taken the initiative in sending automo
biles to Africa for transport purposes, and
though the value of their experiment re
mains to be proven, the Congo Free State
will probably follow their example.
The French now have a line of stations
along the upper and middle Niger.
Freight for these stations is carried on
small steamers up the Senegal to the head
of navigation at Kayes. It Is then trans
shipped to the railroad, which is. com
pleted as far as Badunbe, about forty
miles, and from that point porters carry
it to the Niger, and are about two weeks
on the journey. The growing Importance
of these inland stations makes this slow
freight service really embarrassing, and
as the railroad will not be completed to
the Niger for several years the distin
guished French explorer, Felix Dubols,
conceived the idea of utilizing automo
biles.
Fifty-five wagons, each of nine or ten
horsepower with a maximum speed of
eight miles an hour, have been specially
built in Paris for this service In inland
Africa. The utmost attention has been
piven to details of construction, and they
have been as fully adapted to the peculiar
conditions of the service as Is possible at

The conduct of the strike to-day was in
marked contrast to that of yesterday,
there being no rioting and nobody was
injured during the day. This was per
haps due to the fact that the company
made no efforts to run cars during the
afternoon, having been advised to refrain
from doing so by Chief of Police Camp
bell. The union men who indorse the
strike and are in favor of a sympathetic
strike decided to hold a parade late in the
afternoon and Chief of Police Campbell,
being fearful of trouble if the cars and
the parade should happen to collide, re
quested the company to keep its cars in
the barns.
The parade was a success in point of
numbers and enthusiasm, about 7000 being
in line. Banners and transparencies car
rying mottoes indorsing the strike and
pronouncing In favor of a sympathetic
movement were numerous throughout the
column, which marched through many of
the downtown streets between 4 and 6
o'clock. There waa not the slightest evi
dence of disorder. No policemen were In
the parade and none were needed.
They were offered by Chief of Police
Campbell, but declined by the leaders of
the parade, who said the only use they
had for officers was to have the policemen
keep the non-union men from shooting
them. The parade showed a most enthu-
Elaetio spirit, the marchers shouting and
cheering as they tramped along. The
crowd along the line of march was small
and undemonstrative. The first division
of the parade- was composed of the street
railway men. about 3600 being In line.
The contemplated call for the sympa
thetic strike will not be Issued, in any
event, before Monday, and possibly not
then. The matter of going on a sympa
thetic strike has been referred back to
the unions Individually. They commenced
voting on the proposition to-night and will
have thÂ» matter under consideration un
til Monday night, when the executive
committee will take action on the reports
submitted to it by the various unions.
Opinion Is divided as to what will be
done.
ST. LOUIS, May 19.â For one week at
least the striking employes of the St.
Louis Transit Company will be face to
face with Federal authority, which, speak
ing to-day through Judge Elmer B. Ad
ams of the United States Circuit Court, in
tha form of an Injunction, has command
ed them to abstain from interfering in
any manner with the running of mail cars
on the various street car lines owned by
the Transit Company. The writ of injunc
tion, issued at 4:30 o'clock this afternoon
by Judge Adams. Is sweeping in its na
ture and la made returnable May 26. It
commands the strikers to refrain from
doing anything whatever that will delay
or obstruct the operating of mall cars or
of the gathering or distribution of the
malls. Everything prayed for in the peti
tion for an injunction presented last Sat
urday evening to Judge Adams by United
States District Attorney Rosier was grant
ed. The only point not covered, in the in
junction which the company could possi
bly have asked is that the strikers be en
joined from all interference with tho run
ning of passenger cars.
President W. D. Mahon of the Amalga

of the issuance of the injunction, that the

Intention of bo doing.
"We know what the laws are," he said,

that we will make trouble for the Gov
ernment."

SCHIjEY TTAR THE GBIP.
Over this report unexpcctedl}^ developed j
one of the most Interesting debates of the j
conference, involving the question of the
life leiiure cf bishops. Governor fcshaw ;
cpoke in favor of limiting the" terms ot ,
rnittionary bishops to tight years. Dr. T.
K. Neeley of Philadelphia, in one of the
most impassioned ppeeches so far heard !
in the conference, favored the report.
"This will be a historical day in this
conference." lie said. He favored having
the ijisliops staying on the field, and pro
tested against the idea of life tenure in
the episcopacy. "I believe every Bishop
licre Is subject to the command of the
conference when in session," continued
lir. Neeley. "1 may never have another
opportunity to express myself on this
Vubject, and I do so now. It Is not a
third order. A Bishop who docs not ti?at
his brethren as brethren is an autocrat.
H sometimes is necessary to remove a
man, and the couterence has absolute
power to do so for malfeasance, unfeas
iir.ee or no feasance at all."
Dr. Net-ley's speech was taken as a pro
test against the excessive reverence for
the episcopacy, and when the Philadel
phia divine finally sat down he was greet
ed with prolonged applause.
Dr. Hiram Lov.ry of North China made
a plea for a general superintendent for
that country, with an Episcopal residence
there, instead of a missionary Bishop.
Dr. J. F. Thompson of South America
followed in the same line. Said he:
"This is the second time that my an
nual conference has commanded me to ask
the pxnerai conference not to inflict upon
us what v.-e consider a calamity â a mis
sionary bishop."
MaPhoycshl Takaki of Tokio also op
nosed the sending of another missionary
bishop to Eastern Asia,
Pending action upon the motion to re
commit, the tenth ballot was announced
as follows: J. F. Berry. 337; H. 6pell-
The rules were then suspended to hear
the report of the committee on episco
j,hcj presented by Dr. .Buckley on the
question of retaining the title of "Miesion
juy Bibhuijs," favoring the ratification. Ii
v. as adopted. 'U:e committee also report
ed in favor of another missionary Bishop
of Kastern As;a, his work to embrace
Ubina., Japan and Korea. This report was
uccompu.nied by a written communication
to the con:mittee from the board of bish
ops favoring the election otl an additional
missionary Bibhoji lor thai part of the
world.
When the conference proceeded to cast
the tenth ballot rumors were thick of com
binations between leading candidates for
the episcopacy, and the belief was general
tbMt at ieasi one iiisiiop would be tlected
lriEide of two or three more ballots.
CHICAGO. May 19.â Soon after the
Methodist General Conference assembled
to-day the result of the ninth ballot for
bishops was announced as follows:
J. F. Berry 2^7. H. Spellmeyer 345. D. H.

ST. LOUIS, May 19.â At the third day's
session of the Presbyterian General As
sembly to-day reports on relief for dis
abled ministers and the widows and or
phans of deceased ministers, and also on
the method of appointing standing com
mittees of the assembly, otherwise known
as the "I'eoria Overture," were continued.
A report on ministerial relief was pre
sented by Elder Louis H. Severance of
Cleveland, O.. who showed that the con
tributions of the church had neither kept
pace with the advance of the church nor
with the advance of the roll of annul- 1
tants. He declared that the churches
should very largely increase their usual
contributions to the church. Twenty-five
thousand dollars more was called for in I
contributions this year than was paid
last year, to make the appropriations that
will be required by the various presby
teries.
Rev. Benjamin A. Agnew, D. D., secre
tary of the board of ministerial relief,
made an eloquent plea on behalf of the
ministerial relief fund. He gave a long
array of statistics, showing that the i
board had on the roll to-day one minis
ter's family to every eight ministers, on
the roll of the General Assembly. In
1SC0 the board had only one minister's
family on the roll to every eighty-seven
ministers in the assembly.
Rev. Wallace Kadcllfte, D. D., of Wash
ington, D. C, was the lirst champion of
the Peoria overture, which provides that
the moderator shall, upon the organiza
tion of the assembly, appoint a committee
of ministers and elders to aid him to th.j
appointment of a standing committee,
said committee to be composed of twenty
one commissioners from different parts
of the country, not more than two from
any one synod. .
Before Dr. Radcliffe concluded his ad
dress a call was made for adjournment
until Monday morning, and the time for
further consideration of the method of
appointment of standing committees jf
the assembly was fixed for next Thurs
day.
Many commissioners attended a steam
boat excursion this afternoon despite thÂ«
rain.
A popular meeting' was held in the
Compton-avenue church this -e-'enlner and
live-minute addresses were delivered on
the subject, "Aid for Colleges and Acade
mies." . â¢

Discussion on the subject of itineracy,
which was presented yesterday, was then
resumed. Frank A. Arter of the Kast
Ohio Conference spoke in support of the
majority report, favoring unconditional
abolition of the time limit.
The eleventh ballot was announced as
follows": J. F. Berry. 310; J. W. Hamilton.
881: D. H. Moore. 255; H. Spellmeyer, 239;
T. R. Neeley, 193; E. J. Little, 19; others
1 to 9 votes.
Dr. Neeley'e eloquent speech had ap
parently der-ply moved the conference,
and the* twelfth ballot, which followed im
mediately, was taken amid considerable
confusion.
Dr. J. A. Day of Syracuse University
then took the platform in support of the
majority report of the committee on itin
eracy. "Dr. George B. Bridgeman, presi
dent* of Hamline University, and Gover
nor Shaw also spoke in favor of the ma
jority report. Debate was continued until
after 1 o'clock, when the twelfth ballot
was announced as follows: J. F. Berry,
296; J. W. Hamilton, 272; T. R. Neeley. 235;
D. II. Moore. 234; H. Spellmeyer, 181; J.

ilton. 2S7; T. R. Neeley. 57; E. J. Little, 16;
others from 1 to 9 each.
The eleventh ballot was then taken.
POINT REYES. May 19.â The steamer
San Pedro, bound for Cape Nome, put in
here to-day and left the body of John H.
Jones, a passenger, who had leaped to hi3
death from the steamer's deck a few miles
outside the heads and which was recovered
by the ship's crew. The body was left in
charge of C. J. Bease, foreman of the Ab
bptt ranch at Olema. by Captain Jamison
of the San Pedro. Bease notifled Coroner
Eden of San Rafael of the recovery of the
body, and to-morrow the Coroner will
take it to San Rafael, where an inquest
will be held.
Mystery shrouds the self-inflicted death
of Jones. He was up to a few days ago
a blacksmith at Xovato. in this county,
and was thought to be a prosperous, well
to-do man. Shortly before the sailing of
the San Pedro Jones left Novato without
giving an inkling to any one there of his
intentions. The blacksmith shop remained
closed, and whatever motive urged Jones
to leave Novato the thought must have
come suddenly to him, for no negotiations
were made by him for the sale of his
property, and everything in the shop
stands as he left it the morning he mys
teriously disappeared. Eight hundred dol
lars was found on the corpse, which was
well dressed, and this bears out the story
of his Novato friends, who assert that
Jones had saved plenty of money.
When seen in regard to the suicide's
identity Mr. Scott, a merchant of Novato,
had no hesitation in declaring him to be
his late fellow citizen. Scott says that al
though Jones had a wife and child in Wis
consin, he was on familiar terms with a
young woman, a stranger In the town,
who accompanied him when he left the
place. From what can be learned It looks
as though Jones' death must be added to
the long list of bay mysteries. He was in
good health, with plenty of money, bound
for Cape Nome and buoyed up by dreams
of fortune. Coroner Eden and Mr. Scott
think the young woman might be able to
throw light on the case.

The outcome of the election will affect
San Jose materially. Business men and
large property owners are hustling votes
for Edwards, declaring his election is
necessary to have a bigger San Jose. Ed
wards' progressiveness is needed, and
thousands of people in San Jose tc-night
are hoping his executive ability and puslÂ«
will be at the head of the city's affairs for
the coming two years.
The Union Bank failure is another
stumbling block in the gang*3 fight. The
Rea gang's administration of the bank's
affairs has affected over 1000 San Joseans.
Instead of a speedy settlement, Rea, as
prâ¬*sldent of the bank, has dragged mat
ters along, and in a year and a half its
affairs are no nearer a settlement than
they were the day after the failure. A
small dividend has^ been paid, but Rea
and his friends have stood In the way or
a compromise at 85 cents on the dollar
between stockholders and depositors. - â¢
Severe condemnation of gang methods
aroused by the treatment of Miss Came
ron at the Palo Alto kidnaping outrage is
going to cost Martin many a vote. It will
be remembered that Rev. Mr. Dinsmore
of the First Presbyterian Church de
nounced the Mayor from the pulpit for not
calling a mass meeting to protest at such
acts. All the principals in the kidnapingâ
ex-Di3trict Attorney Herrlngton, Deputy
Constable Tom Harris and Justice Dyer
are gangsters, and they remain in their
places through :he influence of Rea and
others.

SAN JOSE. May 19.â The city campaign
practically closed to-night. Between now
and Monday morning there will be some
quiet work dene, but both sides will take
a rest after three or four days of thÂ©
hardest work ever done in a local elec
tion. The election Monday will call out
a heavy vote, and so well has the cam
paign work been done that but few votes
will be changed on that day.
Mayor Martin has mado the hardest
kind of a fight for re-election. Earnest
workers have aided him, but the taint of
Rea and Mackenzie has driven hundreds
of voters from him. Martin Is gallant il
not a politician. Besides visiting the vari
ous places of employment and leaving
cigars for the men he invariably carried
along a box of candles for the ladies in
the- olace. The campaign has been a
feast* for factory and shop girls, and there
is no doubt if they had a vote Martin
would be re-elected. The big brothers and
fathers of these candy-fed girls, however,
object to the present city administration
and are standing shoulder to shoulder for
Edwards.
The fight made by the citizens' commit
tee of one hundred has been direct and
effective. A. T. Herrmann, the chairman
of the sub-committee, has been at the
head of the work, and to-night he is con
fident that the entire citizens' ticket will
be elected.
The Union Battlefield Veterans, who
take Rea's orders, have entered the cam
paign in the hope of dragging a few old
soldiers into the gang camp. But few
will be fooled by their indorsement of the
gang ticket. These old "vets" are the
ones who caused all the trouble at the
high school two vears ago, which resulted
in the dismissal of Professor Smith and.
the subsequent strike of the students.
Edwards' election is being claimed to
night; and surely he will receive a heavy
vote. The working people are a unit for
him. the churches indorse him, Demo
crats, Republicans and Popul'sts are out
for him, and unless some unforeseen acci
dent occurs the gang ticket will be among
those that "also ran."
There are threp tickets in the field
citizens', administration or gang and so
cialists. The latter will not poll over
three hundred votes. Following are thÂ©
tickets in full: â.,â., '

"WASHINGTON". May 13â^Jitter a
Bplrited debate the Senate to-day by ,the
decisive vote of S2 to IB laid on the table
the whole proposition relating to tho
transportation of mail by the pneumatlo
tube system. An effort was made to se
cure the adoption of an amendment to
appropriate $225,000 to carry out existing
contracts for the Berries In New York,
Brooklyn, Boston and Philadelphia, but
no action was taken upon It, special or
ders superseding the appropriating bill.
When __e Senate resumed consideration
cf the postofuce appropriation the ques
tion pending was the committee's amend
ment extending the pneumatic tube ser
vice.
Hoar offered a substitute for this
amendment ai follows: "For execution
of existing contracts for transportation
of mail by pneumatic tube and such ex
tension of such service as may be Judged
expedient by the Postmaster General and
may in his Judgment be accomplished at
Â«. reasonable cost, not exceeding in any
Â«veat JU.CwO a mile, $750,000."
Sutler of North Carolina tnought the
Oovernment oug-ht to maintain the service
Itself if it were to be maintained at all.
Canery believed Hoar's amendment waÂ»
xalr and conservative, although there were
circumstance* in connection with the
operation of the service as it existed now
that v.ere suspicious.
Hoar contended that hii amendment
committed the Government to nothing ex
cept to the continuation ot existing con
tracts.
Teller thought if the scheme was really
valuable it ought to be operated by the
Government, but he was inclined to the
belief that the whole proposition ought
to be rejected.
Teller moved that the committee's
amendment and that of Hoar fcÂ« laid on
the table. The motion was agreed to, 22

Ayes â Alhsen. Baker, Bard, Barry. Butler,

1-xidKo offered an amendment appro
r:: Â»wiig fito.wj to carry out existing con
tracts for pneumatic tube Ben-ice, the
amendment containing* a provision that
thi-re Lhojld be no extension of the ser
vii e until it was authorized by law.
Without action on ihe Lodge amend
ment, ihe postoJlice appropriation bill was
di^iJlact-d by the special order, which was
the ceremonies attending the reception of
the .statues of Thomas 11. Benton and
Francis P. Blair, which have been placed
In the Statuary Hall of the Capitol by
the State of Missouri.
A t-eries of addresses were madÂ©, begin
r.ir.g with one by Vest, who spoke eulo
trisucaHy and eloquently of both Benton
and Biair. No. event, he said, could go
farther than the presentation of a statue
of Fmneis P. Blair to the National capital
by the Slate of Missouri to emphasize the
fact that the memory of tee war of the
rebellion had been wiped out. Indeed, both
Iienton and Blair had devoted their lives
to the cause of free soil.
Vest's review of Benton's career was an
interesting history of the days of Clay,
Webster and Calhoun. He was. Vest said
not the eQual of Clay as an orator, of
Webster as a lawyer or of Calhoun as an
analytical debater, but he was the supe
rior of ar.y of them as an all-round leg
islator, lie said that but for Blair's in
fluence Missouri would have given her
Â» .: ; military strength to the South, and
if this had occurred It were possible that
the result of the war might have been dif
ferent.
At the conclusion of the epeeches the
resolutions accepting the 6tatues of Ben
ton and Blair were adopted.
The Senate then proceeded to the con
riierauon of the resolution accepting from
the Grand Army cf the Republic the
etatue of General Grant. By special order
of the Senate two of the galleries of the
Senate had been reserved for members of
the Grand Army of the Kepublic Both
were filled. By further special order the
National officers of the Grand Army of
the Republic were admitted to the floor
of the Senate during the exercises attend
ant upon the consideration of the resolu
tion.
H&r.sbro-jgh presented a concurrent res
olution similar to the one offered earlier
In the day in the House by McCleary, and
It was adopted.
A soldier s tribute to a grreat soldier was
the brief Fpeech of Senator Hawley of
Connecticut. He congratulated his com
rades of the G. A. R. upon the successful
consummation of a great work and said
the noble gift was accepted with eym
pathv and gratitude.
A'tVr a handsome eulogy by Harris,
Turloy delivered a notable address from
the viewpoint of a private soldier in the
rank? of the Confederate army. He said
that the sentiments of the people of the
South had in recent years changed to
ward Grant, and gradually had become
those of cordiality and esteem. He never
<-ould reach, he said, that inner chamber
of the Southern people's hearts. That was
occupied alone by the "immortal L*e."
whom the people of the Southland loved
because he was tho very incarnation of
their cause. Turley said he did not think
of Grant as a commander or as a Presi
dent so much as he.thoupht of him as the
gallant soldier, the friend of I>e<Â» and the
protector of the private soldier of the
Confederate army, and as such a Boldier
he paid tribute to the memory of Grant.
Turner spoke- of Grant as the "great,
rllent soldier," who lies upon the bank
of the Hudson. As he struck the hardest
blow so was his hand the" first to pour
the beal!ng balm into the wound thus
made He considered him as combining
the qualities of both Moltke and Welling
ton, for he planned with the precision of
the former and carried forward hia plans
â¢with the tenacity of the latter.
Carter paid a. brief tribute to * the na
tion's greatest military chieftain." and
then Allen concluded the speechmaking
Â¦with a view of General Grant from the
viewpoint of a 'private soldier who
served unfler him.
The Senate then, at B:<3 p. m_ ad

WASHINGTON, May 1*.â The _t_tus of
General Grant, presented by the Grand
Army of the Republic to the nation, was
unveiled In the great rotunda of the Capi
tol to-day and elaborate ceremonies com
memorative of the event were held In the
Hall of Representatives In the presence of
a vast concourse of people, including the
widow, daughter and descendants of the
hero of Appomattox, hundreds of his com
rades In arms, the officers and coxnmltte'e
of the Grand Army of the Republic and
many distinguished in military, political
and social circles.
The statue of the pre-eminent chief of
the Union forces In tie civil war repre
sents the contributions of thousands of his
comrades of the Grand Army of the Re
public, cone of whom was allowed to sub
scribe more than 15 cents, and is the result
of -a movement started shortly after Gen
eral Grant's death, In July, 1Â£85. It Is the
work of Franklin Simmons, an American
sculptor. Of marble, of heroic size, it
stands on a granite pedestal emblazoned
with a bronze seal of the Grand Army of
the Republic, representing the grim old
hero In the full uniform of a general,
equipped for the fleld with top boots and
gauntlets, his cloak over his arm and his
right hand resting on the hilt of his sword.
The "counterfeits" of statesmen, sol
diers and pioneers in marble and bronze
adorn the old House of Representatives
chamber of the Capitol, now Statuary
Hall, but these are rifts of the individual
States, Grant's statue was unveiled in the
rotunda, as befitted the statue of one
whose valiant service was for the whole
nation. There It will remain with the
statues of Jefferson, Hamilton â nd Lin
coln, which are also In the rotunda, an
example and an inspiration to future gen
erations. The hero of Appomattox stands
near the western entrance, flanked on
either side by the famous paintings of the
"Surrender of Cornwallis" and the "Sur
render of Burgoyne."
The unveiling took place shortly before
noon in the presence of Mrs. Grant, Mrs.
Sartoris, Miss Sartoris, the officers of the
Grand Army ol the Republic, Speaker
Henderson and Senator FryÂ©. President
pro tÂ«m of the Senate. The fact of the
unveiling was kept secret and few people
witnessed it. There werj no ceremonies.
Miss Sartoris. attired 1 ... white, drew the
lanyard that uncovered the statue. Mrs.
Grant inspected it carefully and smiled
her approval. The party then repaired to
the hall of the Hcuu, where the ceremo
nies occurred.
The ceremonies In the House were pro
foundly impressive. They consisted of ad
dresses by McCleary of Minnesota, Gros
venor of Ohio. Richardson of Tennessee,
Warner of Illinois. Linney of North Caro
lina, Gardner of Michigan, Brosius of
Pennsylvania and L>olliver of Iowa.
The gallery opposite the Speaker s ros
trum had been reserved for the members
of the G. A. R. and was crowded with
grizzled veterans, who cuxne to pay trib
ute to the memory of their loved comrade.
In the area in front of the Speaker's desk
eat members of the Grand Army and the
committee appointed by the Grand Army
Encampment at Philadelphia, who had
been granted the privilege of the floor for
the occasion by a special resolution.
In the gallery reserved for Mrs. Grant
and her family were Mrs. Grant, her
daughter, Mrs. Nellie Grant-Sartoris:
Lieutenant Sartoris, Miss Sartoris and
Miss Grant, a daughter of Colonel Fred
Exactly at 12 o'clock Speaker Hender
son's gavel fell. After an impressive
prayer by the blind chaplain the commit
tee of the Grand Army, among whom
were Commander in Chief Albert D. Shaw.
General S. S. Burdett. General H. B.
Heath S. V.; Commander In Chief Inrtn
Itobblns and Chaplain In Chief A- I*
Grimm, were ushered Into tho House.
After th* Speaker had announced the or
der of the day McCleary of Minnesota,
chairman of the Committee on Library,
sent to the clerk's desk and had read a
letter addressed to the Speaker presenting
the statue. McCleary then offered the fol
lowing resolution:
Resolved by tho Houso, tbÂ« Senâ ta concur
ring-. That tho thank* of CongreÂ«Â» bÂ« _1vÂ«n to
the Grand Army for the statue of General
U. S. Grant.
Resolved. That thÂ» st&tue bÂ« accepted and
placed in the Capitol and that a copy of these
resolution*, elpned by the presiding officers of
the Houn of Represent-tiveo and thÂ» Senate,
be forwarded to the. chairman of the commit
tee of tha Grand Army of the Republic on the
Grant memorial. â¢
The eloquet eulogies of General Grant
which followed were listened to atten
tively and several times brought round
after round of applause from floor and'
galleries. McCleary said:
In thÂ» Bj>rln_ of 1865. more men movÂ«d obe
dient to the command of General Grant than
were oommanded by Napoleon In all his cam
paigns, from the beginning: of hia meteorlo
career en the plains of Italy and before tho
pyramids of Egypt, until his Â»un set at Water
loo, and the area of Grant's operations exceed
ed the area covered by Napoleon, from the
vineclad hllla of Franca to tha snow-steppes
Â° But"to"appreciatÂ« thÂ« real dignity and worth
of General Grant's service to mankind, they
must be considered in the ll*ht ot universal
history. His _enlu* was exercised to eave to
the world Its most Taluable possession. I meas
ure my words when I say that the most valu
able secular possession of the world to-day la
the Union of the American States. Hundreds
of lives and hundreds of millions of treasure
have been exuended to preserve It. but In Its
potency for good to thÂ» world It Is worth ln
tinltely more than It has cost.
Every man who had any part, however bum
ble. In the preservation of the Union, is en
titled to the gratitude of the world. Henos
the propriety^ of enshrlnlnr within this Capi
tol, the temple of the great pacific principle of
representation, the building: in which the rep
resentatives of the commonwealth meet, a
statue of the great commander through whose
genius the Union was preserved. The statue,
worthy alike of the genius which it com
memorates and the bravÂ« men whose cheerful
contributors produced it. will be accepted, and
It will be preserved In honor through the com
ing centuries.

married while at Harvard to Miss Ed
wards of Cambridge, the fiancee of young
Mr. Boeck of St. Louis, on the day after
the weddinff of the latter two was to
have taken place In a Cambridge church.
News that William W. Sloan Sr. has re
lented and would take the young couple
into his good graces was broughtTjy John
Sloan of Buffalo, uncle of the young man,
who found them In apartments at 113

Story Credited to Huntingdon Is De
nounced as Fiction in Los
Angeles.
LOS ANGELES. May 19. â President
George B. Leighton of the Terminal Rail
way Company, who left for the East to
day, said in an 'interview Just before his
departure that the story credited to C. P.
Huntington that the Southern Pacific and
Santa Fe roads -would Jointly build a road
between â¢ Salt Lake and Los Angeles is
"stuff and nonsense." Mr. Leighton said:
"The Salt Lake road is to be builtâ of
that there is no doubtâ but . neither the
Southern Paciflc nor the Santa Fe will
have anything to do with its construction.
Of that I am absolutely certain. I could
convince you in a moment of what I am
saying, but I am under oath almost not
to divulge. what I know.
"Whoever â¢ does construct the new line,
will build It into -Barstow and that la
also a certainty. Of course, Mr. Hunting
ton has had surveyors In the field look
ing over the territory, along the proposed
new road and so have also several others.
But Mr. Jtiunttngton knows that his
story of a combination road between Los
Angeles and Salt Lake, to be built by the
Southern Paciflc and the Santa Fe, Is pure
fiction and nothing else."
: At Santa Fe local headquarters nothing
confirmatory of the Shji Francisco dis
patch could be learned to-day.
SOUTHERN PACIFIC WILL
NOT BUILD TO SALT LAKE

LOS ANGELES, May 19.â An opinion re
garding: the rights of water companies
and their consumers has been handed
down by the Supereme Court of the
United States and a copy of the same was
received to-day by ex-Judge John P.
Works of this city. The case In which
the opinion is given is that of Osborne vs.
the San Diego Land and Town Company.
The action was begtn January 4, 1S36, in
the United States Circuit Court tn Los
Angeles. On September 1, 1S96, a decision
was rendered by Judge Ross favorable to
the defendant company.
The decision received to-day affirms
Judge Ross' decision.
Judge Ross decided that a water com
pany nad the right and power to establish
and change its own rates and that the
only remedy of the consumers, if the
rates were not satisfactory, was to apply
to the Board of Supervisors to have such
rates fixed by that body. He held fur
ther, that no contract or representation
made by the water company could take
away from the State the right to regulate
and control the sale and distribution of
water by a company of that kind, by fix
ing the rates through the Board of Super
visors, as provided by law.

l"^F Johnson's Digestive TabletsSometimes the public school teachers are deprived
of their pay to reduce the deficit. The reform charter
appears to be ju^t like the consolidation act in regard
to this chronic and incurable deficit, and will probably
make it larger, for it increases the cost of the city
government
As things are goir.g now the city is largely run it
the expense of contractors for mercantile supplies to
the poorhouse, hospital. Police and Fire and other
departments who never get their pay. Occasionally
we economize by putting out the street lights, and
then the bold highwayman flourishes and collects
taxes from the belated citizen regardless of the dollar
What this city seems to need is a reform of its re
formers. All these annual deficits have occurred
while reformers have been running the city. They
get elected by advocating the dollar limit in taxation,
?nd when they get in office proceed to give us a two
collar administration on a dollar limit What we
seem to need is two dollar limit reformers who will
give us a dollar administration.
UNDER the reform charter, "administered by its
friends," San Francisco has another sumptuous
deficit of two hundred thousand dollars or
more. This will be added to amounts already due to
the merchants, who have furnished the city with sup
plies, under penalty contracts, and are still whistling
for their money.
REFORM THE REFORMERS.
Geographical advantages possessed by San Fran
cisco make her the natural metropolis of Pacific
Ocean commerce. Geography and nature, however,
are not the controlling factors in commerce. There
must be business ability, sagacity, energy and the fac
ulty of co-operation among a people to secure for
their city the benefits which trade confers. The move
ment for a Commercial Museum is one of the most
important ventures the people of the Pacific Coast
have ever undertaken to make use of the natural ad
vantages they possess for controlling the ocean trade.
It ought, therefore, to have a liberal, earnest and
prompt support.
The usefulness of such a museum as the one pro
posed has been amply demonstrated by what has been
achieved in Philadelphia. The museum there has al
ready a world-wide fame, and from merchants and
manufacturers in all parts of the globe letters of in
quiry come to its officers asking information as to
markets and prices. So great has been the benefit
conferred upon American trade by the work of the
museum that other progressive nations are discuss
ing plans to establish similar museums, and it is
probable the Germans will soon have one in opera
tion.
More than a hundred firms have signed the roll of
membership, and others are rapidly uniting with
them. It is hardly necessary to say that every mer
cantile, manufacturing and banking firm on the Pa
cific Coast should co-operate with the movement. In
the very nature of things, however, it -is upon the
business men of California the chief burden of carry
ing the enterprise to success will rest. When the
museum has been established and its far-reaching
machinery for promoting trade is in operation there
will then be no lack of members. Applications for en
rollment will come not only from all parts of the coast,
but from all parts of the Union. All will be plain and
easy sailing tljen. The sole difficulty in an enterprise
of this kind is that of starting it, and even that diffi
culty seems now well nigh surmounted. t
GRATIFYING in every respect is the success
which has thus far attended the movement for
the establishment in this city of a Commercial
Museum on the lines of that of Philadelphia, and upon
a scale of sufficient magnitude to make it of first-class
importance to the commercial world. It is but a com
paratively short time ago that the enterprise was first
spoken of among our progressive merchants, and al
ready enough has been achieved to render its early
establishment well nigh certain.
THE COMMERCIAL MUSEUM.

The Lodi merchants who object to the introduction
of a free mail delivery in the rural districts in their
neighborhood for fear it will injure their trade by
freeing the farmers of the necessity of coming to town
for mail are short-sighted. The improvement which
the mail delivery will make in the district will tend
to attract new residents, and the Lodi folks will have
To fair-minded men it will be a matter of regret
that the police authorities did not formulate a defi
nite determination to enforce the law to close
the side entrances at once as soon as they
assumed tHeir official responsibilities instead of
griving the saloon men reason to believe that
if they conformed to the six-foot partition ordi
r.ance they would be permitted to maintain a side
entrance and carry on the business which came
through it. The action of the authorities in that re
spect was almost an implied promise that if the par
titions were of the regulation height the saloon
keepers would be allowed to go on as before. In that
way many proprietors have been unfairly treated and
have suffered a monetary loss of no inconsiderable
value. Such has been the effect of an uncertain and
irresolute administration of police affairs, and while
the evil thus infxicted has been slight in comparison
with the good which will result from closing the side
entrances, it is nevertheless an act for which the au
thorities will be justly censured.
The closing of the side entrances is thus a step in
the direction of good morals. It removes from the
city an allurement which menaced the welfare of all
classes. It is hardly less important lhan the prohi
bition of the track gambling which not infrequently
accompanied the free and easy drinking of the
saloons. By the act another safeguard has been placed
around the youth of the city, and the welfare of the
home has been rendered more secure. There is no
lonper that enticement to vice which was once open,
zr.d the moral tone of the community has been dis
tinctly improved.
The side door to drinking saloons has been the
avenue through which many a woman has walked to
ruin. Familiarity with the practice of resorting to
such places has weakened that fine instinct which
guards the conduct of women and led them by degrees
to accept companionship which corrupts manners
and morals. Moreover, the evil was one which rap
idly widened. Where one woman went another
deemed herself at liberty to follow. In some sets it
became a fashion to resort to such places, and the
fashion in many instances became a habit which ca - r
ried with it a continual temptation to a waste of
money needed in the home, to idling, intemperance,
and worse.
PUBLIC opinion, so far as it reflects the senti
ment of the better element of the community,
cordially approves the action of the police au
thorities in closing the side entrances to saloons. The
action should* have been taken long ago, but th'.
maxim, "Better 2ate than never," applies here, and the
only criticism which will be pronounced adverse to
the course of the authorities will be that caused by
their action in inducing the saloon proprietors to first
make costly expenditures in fitting partitions between
the booths of their resorts and then closing the side
entrances up, thus rendering the expenditures a total
loss which need not and should not have been im
posed.
RIGHT ACTION AT LAST
PriELAN'S PETTY SPITE.
T\A AYOR PHELAN'S letter to General E. S.
/ \ Salomon setting forth the reason why the
* * name of Solomon Cahen was omitted from
the committee appointed by the Supervisors to ar
range for the celebration of Memorial day is one of
the plainest exhibitions of the petty spitefulness and
inordinate vanity of his nature which he has yet dis
played. It discloses feelings which no other man in
San Francisco is likely to share, and reveals a sense
of self-importance which certainly no other man
would be foolish enough to manifest in public and in
writing.
When the Supervisors appropriated $500 for the
celebration of Memorial day it became necessary un
der the charter to appoint a committee to have charge
of the money. Desiring to act in harmony with the
veterans of the Grand Army on the subject, the
Grand Army posts of the city were requested to make
nominations for members of the committee. With
that request the veterans complied, and among the
names sent in was that of Solomon Cahen, a member
of Garfield Post and a' past department commander
of the Grand Army. When the Supervisors made up
the committee they rejected Mr. Cahen. and Mayor
Phelan in explaining the rejection wrote to General
Salomon that he was objected to "on the ground that
as the $500 appropriated for Memorial day was for
the first time in this city made possible by the char
ter, no one opposed to the charter should serve under
it in any honorary capacity, and that Mr. Cahen had
attacked its most vital and important provision;^
hence his name was omitted on final confirmation of
the committee."
Thus it appears a member of the Grand Army is to
excluded from even a purely honorary office in con
nection with the celebration of Memorial day for no
ether reason than that he opposed some of the pro
visions of the charter. It is reported that when the
names were submitted by the posts and the attention
of the Mayor was directed to that of Mr. Cahen he
declared a belief that the nomination would not be
ratified by the Supervisors, and added: "We must
punish our enemies."
It is, then, by way of showing his power to punish
his enemies that Mayor Phelan procures the rejection
of a worthy nominee for an honorary office; for that
he snubs the Grand Army, mocks at the claims of the
veterans and infuses his spite and overweening vanity
into the very celebration of a day sacred to the
memory of the nation's heroic dead.
Out of respect for the solemnity of the occasion
and the memories which are inseparably associated
with it the veterans very naturally declined to contest
the Mayor's action or even to denounce it. Their
course was right, for in the celebration of that day
there should be no scandals. No spitefulness of a
vindictive popinjay in office should b^ permitted to
mar the decorum of the ceremonies. The public,
however, will pass judgment upon the incident. If
every man who in the exercise of his rights and his
intelligence found reason for opposing some clause
of the charter is to be ranked by the Mayor as an
"enemy" and punished for it, those who are thus
placed under condemnation and shut out from even
honorary positions in the city will have good cause
to recall the Mayor's once loud spoken pledge that all
citizens should be treated fairly under his administra
tion, and ask if that is another of his many promises
which were made to get votes and with intent to de
ceive.
After the Railroad Commissioners heard all the evi
dence in the Fresno rate case and gave a decision on
it, the matter has still to go to the courts for trial,
and thus we have another proof that the commission
is of no use even when it tries to be.
THE INFLUX OF JAPANESE.
REPORTS from Washington concerning the im
migration of Japanese into the United States
show that the warning of The Call was not
uttered without cause, nor was it given one day
sooner than necessary. The number of immigrants
is rapidly increasing and has' already reached a point
that renders it dangerous to the welfare of American
labor in all parts of the Pacific Coast.
In response to a resolution of the Senate, the Sec
retary of the Treasury submitted on Friday statistics
obtained from the Commissioner General of the
Immigration Bureau, showing that 2230 Jap
anese laborers arrived in 1898, 3395 in 1885,
and for the ten months Â¦ ending April 30 of
this year 7181. These figures indicate only those
who have come direct to the United States
from Japan, but do not embrace those reaching this
country via Canada. How many there are coming
.in this way the department does not know, but the
Commissioner expresses the opinion that the number
is large. The opinion is expressed that there will be
large increases the coming year. He states that strict
examination is made to prevent the entrance of la
borers under contract.
Such is the record, and no intelligent man can give
it a moment of serious consideration without pe_>
ceiving the menace implied in the figures. Two years
ago the immigration was less than 3000, and now it
has reached such proportions that the number coming
direct to the United States during this fiscal year may
reach 10,000. When to these are added the numbers
of those who are smuggled into the country across the
Canadian line, it will be evident that it is time to call
a halt.
Fortunately the people have become aroused on the
subject, and the attention of Congress has been di
rected to the evil. When The Call sounded its first
warnings of the impending danger it pointed out
the best means to be taken to provide the required
remedy. Our treaties with Japan must be revised,
and the authorities at Washington have been urged to
take steps to that end. The attention which the Sen
ate is giving to the subject shows that the efforts of
The Call to put a stop to the immigration have been
well received. In the meantime it is gratifying that
the labor unions and workingmen generally have be
come interested in the campaign and are bringing
their influence to bear. Immigration fiom Japan is
in many respects more to be feared than immigration
from China, and should be placed under equally
strong restrictions.
It may be a good scheme to administer the gov
ernment of Cuba until the people are capable of ad
ministering it themselves, but it is to be regretted
that the first object lesson in government. which we
have given them is that of looting the Postoffice De
partment.
The persons who .intended to go to Cape Nome,
but had their tickets stolen, may yet have cause to
give thanks to the thief. There is such a thing as
being robbed of an opportunity to get into trouble.
. Kaiser William has given orders for another drama
to be written displaying the greatness of the Hohen
zollern family, and it. is now a question whether he
is elevating the stage or bulldozing it.
If Baden-Powell wishes anything in the British em
pire all he has to do is to ask for it.

In view of this history, it is very interesting to hear
a Democrat advocate the expenditure of two billions
of dollars to secure the election of Bryan by pledging
the party to a vast scheme of internal improvements.
Considered in the light of principle his proposition
that the Democratic party shall spend two bil
lions of dollars on internal improvements ex
cites interest. It carries one back to the wild
warfare made *by that party on the Whigs who
proposed to do some very modest improv
ing in that line. They were attacked by the
Democrats as violators of the constitution, destroy
ers of the liberties of the people, robbers of the treas
ury and everything else criminal. When the old
national road was projected by the Whigs, before the
age of railways, it was denounced as an imperialist
scheme to make it easy to move armies to subdue the
people. That road crossed the Alleghanies, following
the line of Braddock's march to his defeat and death
near Fort Duquesne. and thence projected westward
across Ohio and Indiana. Not only was it opposed
by the Democrats, but when railways were shown to
be practical the same party opposed them. They
could be built only by use of the right of eminent do
main to condemn the right of way. The Democracy,
from New Hampshire to Ohio, opposed this and
fought it to a finish. Had that party had its way this
country, as far as internal communication is con
cerned, would have been in exactly the same condi
tion as China, with its population congested on the
coasts and watercourses.
Every student of American politics has believed that
the election of Bryan would be a pretty tough job,
but hardly any one thought it as tough a job as it
appears to this gentleman, who thinks it will require
a bribe of two billions of dollars.
billion, so that this Democrat is of the opinion tha;
the offer to disburse two billions of dollars among
the people will be necessary to elect Colonel Bryan
and will accomplish that object.
He does not at present go into details. All people
not fit to receive the gift of homes are to be deported.
He does not say who will judge of their fitness, or
where we will send them when deported. But of one
thing he is sure. He says: "Labor demands employ
ment, merchants demand trade, and the farmer de
mands a good price for his produce, and they are not
scrupulous as to the policy that brings it about.
Paradoxical as it may seem in this Christian age. we
have reached a stage where one man's death means
another man's life. Expenditures on the extravagant
scale I propose will reproduce the conditions of the
period 1S64-72."
After this large and free expression of judgment as
to the sentiments of the people, this Bryanite pro
poses his programme. He wants the Democratic
party to borrow and spend five hundred millions in
putting a levee on both sides of the Mississippi River
from New Orleans to St. Paul, and another five hun
dred millions in reclaiming arid lands, to be given trÂ»
all people for homes who deserve homes, all others
to be immediately deported. While these two projects
are going on he desiies the Government to build a
military highway from Portland, Me., to Portland,
Or. What this highway is to be, a railway or a
bicycle track, he does not say. Nor does he tell us
why it is necessary to connect the two Portlands, in
stead of building the road from Skaneateles to Mil
pitas. It is supposed that this road will cost another
A PROMINENT Democrat in Washington City
is out with an affirmative policy which he is
sure will carry the country. He says: "What
the people want is business, and they are not over
particular whether it comes from famine, pillage,
war or external or internal development. Therefore
the only course open to the Democratic party is a
policy of internal extravagance. I am a firm believer
in the Chicago platform, and particularly in its silver
plank. But the people have tasted the sweets of re
vived trade and will be loth to give them up. The
Democratic party cannot meet this by just denuncia
tion. It must oiler a substitute. Even ship subsidy
expenditures are better than none at all. The people
not only favor but demand large public expenditures,
legitimate if possible, but illegitimate if necessary."

Chicago consumers of oranges once
fancied that Florida oranges were supe
rior to those of California, and there was
some reason for this fancy, but when,
seventeen years ago, plants of the Wash
ington navel variety were imported by
the Government from Australia and sent
out to the young colony of Indianians ai
Klverside, Cal., and the plants grew ana
matured, a different complexion was put Â¦
on the affair. Groves of the new variety
multiplied and throve amazingly, and
after a few years there was nothing to bt
said against California oranges. The only
embarrassment was that enough could
not be obtained. . .
Happily, as well for the growers in that
State as for the lovers of the fruit in the
East, at the time of greatest scarcity of
oranges in Florida the "navels" were
abundant and in their prime on the young
trees in Riverside and a score of other fa
vored places. Florida is now turning its
attention more than before "the great
freeze" to the cultivation of the ruling
kind under the setting sun. and after a
few years the people will have the ad
vantage that comes from competition.
The end of the season for early oranges
will be in another week or ten days, and
nearly all the shipments have been re
ceived The principal dealers report that
during the season 434.400 boxes of oranges
have come into this market from Cali
fornia alone. They have not, of course,
all been consumed here, but the great
majority have been. The average quality
has been very high.
Skillful horticulturists, assisting na
ture have by extreme attention and
scientific selection of fertilizers greatly
improved both the appearance and the
flavor of the oranges grown there. They
have made some of them earlier by two
months than formerly they were. For
last Thanksgiving there were Califor
nlas" in this market of a very good color.
Before this year if oranges from that
auarter had been received here for Christ
mas It was thought to be doing remark
ably well. . . Â¦ '"' '<j~
California now has practically a mo
nopoly of this market for its oranges,
cherries and grapes of the best varieties.
Until seven years ago Florida had the
preference here for its oranges. The frost
then killed nearly every grove in that
State, and after two years. Just when the
afflicted inhabitants were plucking up
courage to .plant trees anew, there came
another severe frost and deterred many.
Ever since, however, the new settings
have been untouched by the winter cold,
and Florida is once more to be congrat
ulated upon the prospect it has, accord
ing to recent reports, of gathering at
least 1,000,000 boxes of oranges next year.
But Chicago dealers in this fruit say
that the Florida crop will have to be
three or four times larger than that be
fore many "Indian Rivers" will be seen
in this market. The bulk of them will be
shipped by water to New York. This last
winter there has been a small trade of
the kind, but only fifty carloads have
been received here, while possibly, it is
said, 200 carloads have gone to New York.

CALIFORNIA ORfJNGES.
OUR PRODUCTS ATTRACT ATTENTION.
It is therefore more than probable that
California will forge to the front as a
manufacturing State, and her location at
the gateway to the Orient highly favors
such a probability.
California has always been thought of
mostly as a fruit and general produce
State, with a record for gold mining in
days gone by. When the subject of its
future as a manufacturing State was
broached it seemed a foregone conclusion
that that was among the impossibilities,
for nowhere in the Golden State has coal
been found in quantities worth mention-
Ing as a commercial factor. Recently
there have been wonderful and wide
spread discoveries of oilâ mostly fuel oil,
though illuminating oil has been found
and Is produced in goodly quantities.
California has been producing oil for
many years. Some of the wells have
been pumping steadily for as long as
twenty-five years, aryj recently the inter
est has become very much more general.
The increased production has been suf
ficiently large to assure fuel users that
they would be safe in making such altera
tions as are necessary to use oil instead
of coal. The Santa Fe Railroad has al
tered all its engines used on its California
lines, and now uses fuel oil only, and
saves 17 per cent in cost as compared with
coal. Big buildings in Los Angeles have
given up using coal and are able to heat
their structures for less than half of the
cost of coal. Traction engines and other
such like machinery are run by this fuel,
and the owners state that not only
is it a great saving in the Cost of fuel, but
it saves the cost of transporting weight
and also saves the wages .of the man who
used to have to be employed as a fireman,
as thfe oil runs into the firebox without a
stoker's assistance.
One of the peculiarities of the develop
ments in California is the fact that the
Increased production has not decreased
the going price of oil, nor do large pro
ducers find any difficulty in readily selling
their oil. This will be understood when
one considers that such a great concern
as the Union Iron Works of San Francisco
takes 20,000 barrels a month and uses them
for fuel, while at Redding one large
smelter company is building a storage
tank to hold 125.000 barrels of oil, for use
instead of coal in the furnaces.
In casting up the value of Colorado's
many resources It is the custom to speak;
of our coal, gold, silver, copper, agricul
tural lands, railroad interests, etc., but
very rarely do we take any interest in the
value of the oil discoveries within the bor
ders of our State. Tet the value of these
has been accentuated most markedly of
late by the oil excitement that now exists
in California, from the bay of Frisco clear
down to San Diego.

conducted, to ascertain from the landlord
If it Is agreeable to him that there be a

Table Mountain Ropeway.
The ropeway located at Table Mountain
is an Important example of a line 52S0 feet
long. It consists of a single fixed rope on
which one carriage is drawn to and fro
with an endless hauling rope, the driving
gfar having reversing motion so that the
direction of travel of the carrier can be
controlled. Commencing at sea level, and
following the ground on posts spaced
about 300 feet apart, the cable takes a
span of 1500 feet, rising to a projecting
rock some 14S0 feet above the starting
point. Resting on a support at this point.
the cable again takes a span of 1400 feet
to an upper terminal 220) feet above the
lower one. This ropeway has worked so
satisfactorily that It is not only used for
the carriage of materials employed in the
construction of a reservoir, but is at
times used for passengers. â Engineering

Diminishing 1 Dread of Earthquakes
in California.
The damage caused by earthquake in
the San Jacinto Valley proves that the
shock, was sevci *r, but it will not start
the Californians to emigrating. They
have ceased to fear earthquakes, reserv
ing all their terrors for the thunderstorms
of the East, which they do not have, and
leave It to the delightfully frightened
tourist to revel in his novel experience
and tell his tale of hair-breadth 'scapes
when he shall have returned home.
Both in California and Hawaii the usual
"seismic disturbance" Is entirely harm
less until it gets to disturbing the imagi
nation. Then it promotes unveracitv, and
the conservators of the truth and land
values in those parts are kept busy deny
ing and rit^cullng: sensational stories.
Among old residents there is no appre
hension, because not a year goes by that
a chance is not given them to realize how
little danger there Is in the average
shock. Moreover, the diminishing effect
upon the public mind Is demonstrated
most conclusively in the very practical
matter of building.
When the Palace Hotel was erected in
San Francisco a quarter of a century ago
there was still considerable uneasiness
over earthquakes, which was reflected in
the plans of the architects. Immense
foundations were provided for and thick
pyramidal walls, which were designed to
give the greatest possible power of re
sistance. Furthermore, in spite of these
extraordinary precautions. It was not
deemed prudent to carry the vast struc
ture above some seven or eight stories
But the precedent is now completely
Ignored. Stone and brick, once prohibited
materials, are freely used without any
special means of security, and the steel
framed sky-scraper is a common s'ght In
the city. Cosmopolitan San Francisco
goes serenely on its way as though such
a thing as a seismic wave had never been
heard of.
Of course such a working out of the
theory of probabilities would not satisfy
the man who never wound his watch for
fear he would break the spring. Towns
have been swallowed up through the ac
tion of earthquakes and others may bÂ«Â».
But It is clear that the policy of th*Â» Cali
fornians is dictated by the rules of com
mon sense. For it would be absurd to
forego the most profitable use of property
on the remote chance of a disaster which
Is never likely to occur. â Chicago Times-

YONE NOGUCHI
WILL GO EAST
THE 'Japanese poet Tone Isoguchl will
leave San Francisco early this week
for Washington, D. C. He will be
the guest of Charles Warren Stod
dard on his arrival in the capital city,
where he intends staying for some
months.
Mr. Noguchl's two little volumes of
verse, "The Voice of the Valley" and
"Seen and Unseen," the "monologues of
a homeless snail." which were published
in San Francisco three or four years ago,
created no little attention on their ap
pearance. Charles Warren Stoddard, GU
ette Burgess and Porter Garnett, who un
dertook the prefacing of the poems, spoke
in terms or warmest admiration of the
young singer from the Orient, ranking
very high hia poetic faculty. A mert
youth of 20, struggling with the most
difficult literary' form in an unfamiliar
tongue, Noguchi's venture was awaited
with much interest and curiosity among
the literary folk. A small but genuine
succes d'estime greeted the -little volumes
among the poets and litterati of both
East and \\ est, and great things were
prophesied for the Oriental poet. This
promise as yet remains unfulfilled, Mr.
Nojruchl having confined his literary et
forts since that time to his own language.
It Is understood that the English poem
will again claim his attention in his East
ern home.
the value of the Canadian minerals has
increased fivefold. In last year's total
is Included Jlo.Ow.OOO of Klondike gold and
the gold total was $21,049,730. Gold is the
foremost mineral and coal the second,
amounting last year to $&,040,05$.
The rumor that the "Utica Mining Com
pany will attempt to get possession of a
part of the townsite of Angels has led
to an investigation of the original sur
veys. The Calaveras Prospect says that
the Confidence mine was located by John
Fletcher and others in the early days and
that it was marked off on the townsite
map as the Confidence mine and so ap
pears in the field notes of the survey.
The title to the ground has never been
relinquished, but has been kept up by
the performance of annual assessment
work by the heirs of Mr. Fletcher. The
great majority of the mines within An
gels townsite are held in the same way,
notably the Utica, the Raspberry and
many other valuable properties.
Trinity County has won in live separ
ate cases Involving the taxes for the year
VSA on mining properties. Suits wero
brought by C. W. Smith. Robert Wood-
Lurn, La Grange Hydraulic Gold Mining
Company, the lirown Bear Mining Com
pany and the AUoona Quicksilver Mining
Company, respectively, to set aside in
creases in assessments of the properties
of the parties named, amounting to $160,
750, that had been ordered by the County
Beard of Equalization. Judge Jones, in
the Superior Court in Trinity County, da
citied that the plaintiffs must pay the
taxes. The matter may be tried in the
Supreme Court on appt-al.
The Shasta Electric Light and Power
Company has been incorporated under
the laws of West Virginia, with capital
stock of 5I.0uu.O00, divided into lw.ouO
shares at 510 each. The directors are:
Charles A. Warren, Charles E. Green.
Fred S. Edlinger and Fred S. Knight, all
of San Francisco. The works may be
turning wheels in Shasta County mines
before the end of the present year.' This
la what is known as the Sprout plant,
tne construction work on the McCloud
River above Baird being under his
charge. .
The suits and counter suits over the
Anaconda and St. Lawrence mines are le
gion. On one side is the Amalgamated
Copper Company and on the other the
Montana Ore Purchasing Company and
F \_ Heinze. The property Involved is
roughly valued at 51<w.O0u.C>0O. The receiv
ership suit which has lately -come into
court at Butte is the outcome of Heinze's
claim for Ji.Ow.OOO for trespass and dam
age to the Copper Trust mine, which he
owns The Copper Trust claim is a small,
triangular piece of ground lying between
the Anaconda and the St. Lawrence. Ow
ing to loose engineering methods the ex
istence of this fraction was unknown until
Heinze appeared upon the scene and dis
covered it.
About sixty men are employed in the
new mining district west of Gazelle, In
Shasta Valley, most of them In the Dewey
mine. Many other claim holders, says the
Yreka Journal, intend to start work In
the same district as soon as the new road
connecting with the Gazelle and Calla
han's wagon road is finished, so that sup
plies can bÂ« hauled.
Work on the Dane and Mitchell mines,
near Pine Grove. Amador County, has
! bVen resumed. In the same county the olo.
i Richmond property, under the name of
the Philadelphia mine, is being opened up.
The Spring Valley Hydraulic gold mine
at Cherokee. Butte County, will resume.
Work on the restraining dam has begun.

Here are some of the statement*:
"The oil boom has struck Summerland
with a vengeance and oil Btock is as
plentiful on the streets of Summerland a*
autumn leaves in a maple grove on a
wmay day. In fact, you may have oil
stocX for the asking, and one of our citl
ztns waa heard to say that he -intended
to have his pockets sewed up so that no
one could give him oil stock when he was
not looking." These remarks axe dosed
up with the following: "When it la taken
into consideration tnat JwAÂ» to JluOO. will
sink a well and set it to pumping in Uiia
neld it looks absurd to see a company
capitalized for a million or more floating
stock on a tract of land hardly big enough
to make a garden patch."
Eben Siniin, a Colorado mining million
aire, has associated with W. P. Dunham
in developing oil property near Saugus, in
the Newnall district. Tftey have secured
a tract of about 3000 acres.
Various localities are struggling Â¦with
the problem of how to value an oil well.
In Pennsylvania a well is estimated to be
worth 'v^jM lor each barrel of daiiy
production. In California the conditions
Â«re very different, for California oils
vary largely in specinc gravity and where
welis are contiguous mere lias been a
steady diminution in the supply after
pumping of the adjacent properties was
oegrun. Probably the best basis for valua
tion in California is careful investigation
in every case.
The Del Mar country In San Diego
County is now filled with prospectors.
Several wells will probably be sunk there
soon. "Waldo Waterman, the president of
the San Diego Oil Company, has ordered
the machinery for a test well to be drilled
about two miles from Del Mar. Water
has been piped to the location at Morena
and work will begin there soon. A well
will be sunk on the Ralph Granger place.
The report is circulated that at least 640
acres has been adaexi to the known oil
territory in the Kern district by the dis
covery of petroleum on the Mount Diablo
Company's land.
The i.scondido Oil Company In San
Diego County is trying to get leases to
15,0vJ acres of land on the theory- that if
oil is not found in one place it may be
found in another.
The Southern California Oil and Stock
Exchange limited its membership to 200.
After the new exchange came into the
field the Los Angeles Oil Exchange de
bated whether it would not list stock3 of
non-producing wells. The decision was to
adhere' to the old rule, which shut out the
wells -which have only a speculative
value.
i The sales in the Los Angeles Oil Ex
' change in April amounted to 11O.S06 shares
; at a total valuation of $Â£6,S14 15. In the
preceding month the sales were 6^*4
shares, valued at $30,S<)5.

The expected has happened In the Kern
River oil district. The Grace Company
having bored down to the- lower sand
strata, other companies are preparing to
do the same. The lower level is reported
to be more prolific than the first or upper
one. The "West Shore people expect to
sink their next well lower. The Grace
Company found, according to local report,
the second sand below a thick layer of
clay.
While San Francisco Is getting along

A LOW-PRICE EXCURSION
THROUGH CHARMING COUNTRY.
Early ln the morning the police laid
their plans for the arreet of Slmpton and
Sylva. They were unnecessary, however,
as Sylva .and Slmpton had formulated
plans still earlier to surrender themselves
into custody. They came over from Sau
ealito on an early boat and called at the
oiftces of the lawyers opposing Mrs. Cra
ven. On the opening of court they Bur
rendered to the police and were Imme
diately released on bail, $5000 cash ln each
case being accepted by Judge Law lor.
Sylva and Simpton were accompanied by
ex-Governor Uudd and Charles Neal. man
ager of the Fair estate, who advanped the
ball for the release of the alleged per
jurers. Sylva and Slmpton will, it is said,
be backed by the millions of the Fair es
tate ln their efforts to escape punishment
for their alleged crimes, and on the other
hand It Is said every effort will be made
by those interested in Mrs. Craven's de
feat to secure her conviction. Mrs. Cra
ven's case has been assigned to Judge
Cook's department for trial, Slmpton will
be tried by Judge Lawlor and Judge
Dunne will try Sylva.
Attorneys representing both sides ln the
Fair-Craven litigation express their view
that the Grand Jury went too far ln Its
efforts to aee that justice Is meted out to
the wrongdoers. Pence & Pence say the
indictment of Sylva and Slmpton was only
giving them their Just deserts, but they
claim the Indictment of their client, Mrs.
Craven, was an outrage. On the other
hand, the Fair attorneys say the indict
ment of Sylva and Slmpton should not
have been done, but the indictment of
Mrs. Craven was Just and proper.
Fifteen thousand dollars ln shining
double-eagles are now ln the vaults of the
County Clerk's ollice. This sum repre
sents the price paid by Mrs. Nettle R.
Craven-Fair, Adolph Sylva and G. W.
Slmpton for their liberty pending the ver
dict of the Juries t.iat will try them on the
charges of perjury and subornation of per
jury. Mrs. Craven, as heretofore pub
lishedl was released on bail Friday even

PARK WILL GET
SWEEPINGS FROM
CITY'S STREETS
Will Be Used to Fertilize
the Great Pleasure
The Merchants'. Association Co-ope
rating 1 With the Commissioners
to Effect a Much-Needed
Bef orm and Economy.
The Merchants' Association and the
Golden Gate Park Commissioners have
for several years been trying to have the
street sweepings sent to Golden Gate
Park Instead of being dumped on vacant
lota, as is the present practice, when the
necessary permission can be secured
from property owners. The desired re
form now seems ln a fair way of accom
plishment and over 3000 cubic yards of
nne fertilizing material, which Is each
month being wasted while thousands of
trees in Golden Gate Park are actually
suffering from the -want of it, will soon
be distributed where it will do the most
good.
In order to effect the delivery of the
street sweepings at the park at the least
cost a special clause was inserted ln the
charter authorizing the Board of Super
visors to permit the street railway com
panies to haul street sweepings to tha
park over their lines.
The Merchants' Association took up this
subject Beveral months ago and Its su
perintendent, L. M. King, has evolved a
plan for getting the sweepings- to the
park. The first thing to be done was to
provide a suitable central station where
the sweepings could be deposited by the
contractors, so that they could be easily
loaded on the cars. A city lot, formerly
assigned to the Fire Department on
Eleventh street at Its Intersection with
Bryant, was selected. The street sweep
ing contractors report that the lot is well
situated for the reception of material
from the business district, and part of
the Mission to the amount of 3000 cubic
yards per month. The officials of the Mar
ket Street Railway Company also report
that the lot is well situated for the lay-
Ing of a epur track to the bunkers, where
their cars may stand while being loaded.
Plans for switches, driveways, bunkers,
etc., have been made.
The railway company has agreed to
haul the sweepings to Golden Gate Park
for SO cents per cubic yard, delivering the
same at any points on the H street line
that the Park Commissioners may desig
nate. The latter may make connections
by laying their own temporary spur tracks
on which the company's cars will run as
may be desired.
Superintendent King estimates that the
cost of material for the bunkers will be
$2160 and the labor 53500 more. The re
moval of the sweepings by the railroad
at 30 cents will amount to approximately
$1000 a month. . All these and other Inter
esting matters have been presented In a
report to the Board of Supervisors.
Superintendent McLaren has frequently
called the attention of the Park Commis
sioners to the waste of this valuable fer
tilizer by dumping on private lots, de
claring that if it could be placed in the
park the appearance of the great pleas
ure ground would be greatly improved.
More than that, It would be on the line of
economy, for at present fertilizing mate
rial and loam is obtained for the park
only at a great expense.

ADVERTISEMENTS.
A GOOD COMPLEXION
Depends on Good Digestion.
This is. almost an axiom, although us-
ually we are apt to think that cosmetics,
face powders, lotions, fancy soaps, eta,
are the secrets for securing- a clear com-
plexion. But all these are simply super-
ficial assistants.
It Is Impossible to have a good complex-
ion unless the digestive organs perform
their work properly; unless the stomach
by properly digesting the food taken into
It furnishes an abundance of pure blood,
a good complexion is Impossible.
This is the reason so many ladies are
using Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, because
they promptly cure any stomach trouble
and they have found out that perfect di-
gestion means a perfect complexion and
one that does not require cosmetics and
powders to enhance Its beauty.
Many ladies diet . themselves or deny
themselves many articles of food solely ln
order to keep their complexion clear.
When Stuart's Dyspepsia tablets are used
no such dieting la necessary; take these
tablets and eat all the good, wholesome
food you want and you need have no fear
of indigestion nor the sallow, dull com-
plexion which nine women out of ten
have, solely because they are suffering
from some form of indigestion.
Bear in mind that beauty proceeds from
good health, good health results from per-
fect digestion and we have advanced the
best argument to Induce every man and
woman to give this splendid remedy a
trial. :
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets can be found
in drug stores and costs but 60 cents per
package.
If there Is any derangement of the
stomach or bowels they win remove It and
the resultant .effects are good digestion,
good health and a clear, bright complex-
ion.

city are deeply shocked by the Seeley
pinner features of the programme that
was provided for the annual meeting of
the Bank Officers' Association which took

so much outraged by the gyrations of a
beautiful and scantily clad actress after
the conclusion of the dinner that they
left the banqueting 1 room in high dudgeon
and threaten to sever their connection
with the organization if the offense Is re
peated. Heretofore the programmes fur

Mrs. -Patriquin had learned the meaning,

Rally and Essay Contest.
The fourth district rally and essay con
test of the Lreague of the Cross will be
held this afternoon in Native Sons' Hall,
on Mason street. A splendid programme
has been arranged, including musical
numbers by Miss Rose Broderlck. Pro
fessor Thomas Nowlan and William
Judge. Major D. C. Deasy will act as
chairman. Essayists from St. Mary's
Cathedral. St. Brigid's, Holy Cross. Sa
cred Heart and St. Francis' parishes will
compete.
A record of success attained Is always
interesting. In this day of the sharpest
competition in mercantile affairs ever
known the assertion is freauently made
that a young man starting his career
without capital is badly handicapped. In
dividual instances disproving this asser
tion, however, constantly recur and tend
to emphasize the theory that business
capacity, combined with energy, will cre
ate opportunity and mold it into success.
Twelve years ago a firm was established
at the corner of Sixth and Harrison
streets In San Francisco for the purpose
of creating a trade in tobacco. With a
stock of 500 cigars and one horse and
wagon the head of the firm started out
peddling in a small way his limited stock.
In the course of ten years, by persistent
attention to business, the sale for gooda
so increased that larger accommodations
became imperative. The business, was ac
cordingly moved to a more pretentious
building on Market street, where to-day
the combined space of three floors are
only sufficient to transact the firm's
affairs and twelve delivery wagons are in
constant use. The firm referred to is
Chas. Mattheas & Co., 1430-32-34 Market
street, and their stock of tobaccos com
prises the largest variety carried by any
store In the United States, and their
wholesale trade is limited only by the
boundaries of the entire State. The stock
comprises from twelve to fifteen hundred
brands and no house on the coast Is bet
ter equipped to satisfy the user of to
bacco. The firm is the coast agent for
many of the leading brands of cigars,
both foreign and domestic. A branch haa
recently been opened at the corner of
Eddy and Market streets that has created
much favorable comment. Beside being
most centrally located it Is artistically
unsurpassed by any similar store in the.
city.' It is finished throughout with only
California material and labor and is a
tribute to California's craftsmanship. The
firm is now receiving semi-monthly im
portations of the leading brands of Ha
vanna cigars, a feature that Insures the
freshest and finest stock to smokers. â¢

A new four-masted schooner, the largest
ever 'built on the Pacific Coast, was
launched last night from Matthew Tur-
Launching of the Rosamond.
The steam schooner J. S. Klmball waa
launched last night- at Everett and the
work of getting her ready for commis
sion will be rushed as fast' as possible
She Is built on the same lines as the
steamer Nome City, now being outfitted
at Mission street, but is eight feet longer
and Is believed to be a speedier sailer
She is to be built up in the same manner
as the Nome City for the Nome trade and
will carry a large number of passengers
and lots of freight. About 300,000 feet of
dressed â¢ lumber will be loaded upon her
at once, and she will be brought , down
here this week in tow of a. tug. The lum
ber-will be just sufficient to build herun
On her arrival here all of the men possible
will be put to work on her. and it is ex
pected that she will be made ready for
sea . more rapidly than any other vessel
ever outfitted in this port. The J. S. Klm
ball is the sixth of the series 'of Nome

Company. ,

The Barfillan was on her way from Car
diff for Santa Rosalia and had nearly
reached her destination when the accident
happened. Young Warner was out on the
bowsprit fishing when he lost his balance
and tell overboard. A lifebuoy was Imme
diately thrown to him, the sails put aback
and a boat lowered. For three hours thÂ«j
boat rowed back and forth over the spot
where the young man had fallen, but not
a trace of him could be found.
The boat was called back and then Cap
tain Arthur put on his thinking cap. He
reasoned that the wind that was constant
ly carrying the Barfillan to leeward would
have no effect on the lifebuoy and its oc
cupant, supposing young Warner had suc
ceeded In reaching it. He accordingly
started in working the Barflllan to wind
ward, and after eight hours of persistent
searching the lifebuoy with Warner hang
ing in it more dead than alive was 'found.
He was got aboard quickly, and two days
later was as well as ever. It was before
breakfast when Warner fell overboard,
and the sun had set and darkness was
coming on before he was rescued. Many
another captain would have given up the
eearch long before, but Arthur stuck to
it and rescued his man.
It is rarely that a man falls overboard
in midocean and after eleven hours of tor
turing doubt is picked up by his ship
again after all hope had fled. Marry War
ner, an apprentice boy on the British ship
Barfillan, nad such an experience, and he
is not likely to forget it in a hurry. He
is a brother of Captain Warner, late chief
oflicer of the St. l-'iul and now master of
the bit; Nome steamer C. D. Lane. In a
letter to his brother he says that hart it
not been for Captain Arthur of the Bar
flllan, who persisted in keeping up the
search after every man on board had
given him up for dead, he would never
nave been heard from again. â¢

There was another exodus yesterday of
vessels bound for the gold fields. They
did not take many passengers, as all of
them are to call at other ports for their
loads on the way north. The Homer was
the first to get away. All her passenger
accommodation was taken up, but the
gold hunters among them will leave the
vessel at Dutch Harbor, as the vessel is
under contract to carry the Government
mail to all Alaskan points. Among those
who went north on the vessel was the
Russian Archbishop. His diocese takes
in Alaska and the Alentlan Islands, and
this will be his annual tour of inspection.
The choir of the Graeco-Kussian church
on Filbert street was down to see thb
Arcnbishop away. There was a praise
service and a tew prayers, after winch

Had Already Served a Sentence of
Three Years' Imprisonment for
Forgery.
Edward Grlmmell, the young Govern
ment clerk Indicted for forgery, appeared
yesterday before United States District
Judge de Haven and pleaded guilty to
the Indictment. There are nine counts,
and as each charges the commission of
a felonv Grlmmell will be likely to spend
nine years in Jail even under the mini
mum sentence. ' . -* .
Assistant United States Attorney Ban
ning called the attention of the court to
the fact that Grlmmell had but recently
completed the serving of a sentence of
three years' â Imprisonment In the Ohio
penitentiary for forgery. The prisoner is
only 24 years old.
Grimmell was ordered to appear Mon
day for sentence. '. .
A rather' good looking young woman of
about 19 years sat In the courtroom dur
ing the proceedings. Grimmell said that
she was his sweetheart and that if she
remained true to him he would marry
her when he got out of prison.

SACRAMENTO, May 19.â A special to
the Record-Union from Folsom says the
State Prison Directors met there to-night
and after the transaction of routine busi
ness took up at the request of Director
Devlin the matter of certain charges made
against offlcifils of the prison. Charles
Matheson, recently discharged by "Warden
Wilkinson from the position of foreman
of mechanical work, held for nine years,
said he and Lieutenant. Lamphrey were
removed because they are Republicans.
Certain convicts knew months beforehand
that they were to be let out.
Orders were given to convicts by Fitz
gerald and Baker over Matheson's head,
though all orders should previously come
through him. Hnggerty, who got Lam
phrey's place, tola him (Matheson) that
a convict had tried to stab him, and he
did not propose to hold such a place. He
would go to San Francisco and see his
pull and get a position that suited him.
No matter, he said, how well a man
does his work, he can get and hold a place
only through his pull.
The further, hearing of the matter was
postponed until the meeting on June 15,
when ' Director Wilkins will be heard.

Happy Members of the '
Craft and Friends.
El Campo. the pretty seaside picnic re
sort in Marln County, was crowded with
picnickers yesterday on the occasion : of
the Initial "printers' day" outing, given
by the Employing Printers' Association of
California. Fully 6000 printers and their
families attended the outing. It was an
ideal"day for an outing, and not an acci
dent or disagreement arose to mar the full
enjoyment of the occasion. Three boats
were necessary to transport the picnickers
to the grounds. The steamers left at 10:30
a. m. r and 12:30 and 2:30 p. m., and were
filled to their utmost capacity on each trip.
The aquatic races were postponed until
the arrival of the second boat. They
proved hishly exciting and good time was
made in the events.. Bennett's band dis
coursed excellent dance music during the
day and the pavilion was crowded with
devotees of that interesting pastime.
The athletic events were witnessed by a
large crowd, and the first man to cross
tne tape in each event was given an pva
tlon The programme of literary exercises,
held in the pavilion, was of high order and j
each number won deserved . applause.
Under the direction of Master of Ceremo
nies George Norton the following numbers
were rendered:
Selection by orchestra: vocal duo, "Always,"
Baker brothers: remarks. President George F.
Neal- Â¦ Emalada Quartet. ""Spanish . Serenade. V

Cathedral Council, Y. M. I,
Enjoys an Outing in
the Mountains.
ilore than SOO picnickers, laden with ca
pacious lunch baskets and attired In sum
mer costumes, hied themselves yesterday
to Sunset Park. Santa Cruz Mountains, to
attend the annual excursion and outing of
Cathedral Council No. 50. Young Men's In
stitute. That every one who took the trip
had a cood time was evidenced by the
smiling faces and expressions of delight
seen and heard on the homeward journey.
The day was perfect for a picnic and
the 'attendance ail that the members of
the organization could desire. The crowd
was select by reason of the fact that tha
affair v.aa strictly invitational. Every
body went to have quiet enjoyment, and
in this all 'were satisfied.
An excellent band discoursed musics
throughout the day. The dancing plat
form was crowded with moving couples.
Those who did not care to indulge In this
pleasant pastime rambled through the
pretty valley or waded in the brook that
runs through the picturesque grounds.
The committee having the picnic In charge
decided that the usual games of the ordi
nary picnic could be dispensed with, and
in this displayed wisdom. The games were
not missed because of other attractions.
During the afternoon an Interesting pro
gramme was rendered In the pavilion. Mr.
williama and Miss Stevens did a graceful
cakewalk. Jiiss Irene Callahan did a fancy
dance and Miss. Quinn recited. The suc
cess of the outing was due to the ener

His Passage on the Zea

Tom James, chief steward of the
Zealandla, was sitting in his office yes
terday planning work for the small army
of men in his department who are to look
after the comfort of the crowd of gold
hunters booked for Nome, when a broad
shouldered old man, with a long white
beard but bright eyes and erect figure.
thrust his head in the door and inquired
in a voice that rumbled like thunder:
"Say, cap, any chance for a wlllin' feller
to work his way to the Nome diggins?"
"Don't see a chance for you, pop," was
the reply; "but it strikes me that you are
pretty well along in years to be taking
your chances with the boys away up
north there."
The old man took off his big slouch hat
and mopped his wrinkled forehead with
the remnants of a red bandana and
smiled a superior smile as he replied:
"Wai, I'm goin' on 77 year old, and seen
a heap of rough times in my life; but I
don't reckon that none o' thes6 young
fellers can get, any advantage of the old
man yet. I been rainin' now for more'n
lifty year, all up and down this coast, in
South Ameriky, Alaska and Australie.
Sometimes I've struck it rich and more
often I've been broke, like I am now;
but I never seen the time yet when the
old man didn't get where he wanted . to
go. I ain't askln no charity, 'cause I can
do as s good a day's work as any of these
'ere young fellers you're stocked up with,
and I can make my bacon anywhere. I'm
offerln' yer a business proposition, an' if
you don t want to take it there ain't no
offense. But you'll find the old man on
the beach when yer get there, now, you'll
see. He's got the fever, and there ain't
nothin' goin' to "stop him. Good day t*'

He was made Chief of the Uureau of

His visit to the naval yards of this- coast
in his official capacity will tend to show
him the immense developments that have
taken place during his long absence and
will demonstrate to him that in these
yards are some of the most complete
plants for shipbailding and repairing that
the nation owns.
The visit of the admiral should be of
b^nr-fit to the coast, for it is said he has
always had a warm spot in his heart for
his old home. He may make some recom
mendations that will bear good fruit. He
is credited with a faculty of never forget
ting friends. Some of those who have long
held good positions at the Mare Island
navy yard are said to owe their security
in these places to him.

" Chief Engineer Howard E. Holmes of
the Harbor Commission stated yesterday
that he will resign his position in a short
time and that his assistant, Henry Ryan,
will be appointed to succeed him.
"I had intended for some time to re
sign," he said, "but Â¦when some of these
contractors who tried to job the State and
failed attacked my integrity- in the news
papers I came very near changing my
mind in order to show them that their
efforts were in vain. It was cowardly,
because they knew that I was going to
step down and out. Ryan tried to job me.
I'll give him Just three months on the job,
and then' he'll either resign or be re
moved.
"I've been chief engineer for eight years,
and during that time more improvements
have been made on the water front than
during its entire previous history, or will
be made for years to come. I've stood
between the State and the men who want
ed to rob the public coffers. Then they
tried to blacken my character. I always
have courted investigation and do still. 1
have private business interests that will
take all my time, and 1 will leave the
service of the Stato feeling that I have
done my duty."
A fortnight ago Holmes was accused by
his assistant, Henry Ryan, of irregulari
ties in connection with the building of
Howard-street wharf. The Harbor Com
missioners held an executive investigation
of the charges and then let the matter
drop without taking any action or mak
ing any report. It was understood at the
time that the matter was dropped because
of the fact that Holmes was about to re
sign. Holmes was Informed that hereafter
he will be expected to report all matters
under his Jurisdiction to the board, and
must not permit any changes In specifica
tions without Its consent.
It is understood that Holmes is to be a
consulting engineer in the employ of the
Santa Fe Company and is to be chief en

rr F there ever was a doubt that genial
I Uncle George Bromley was not the
J[ first passenger conductor on this coast
it was removed for all time at ths
second annual excursion and picnic of El
Capltan Division No. 115. Order of Rail-
Way Conductors, held at Mirabel Park
yesterday. The aged Bohemian facetious
ly narrated his history as a ticket
puncher, recited his soulful poem entitled
"When the Cows Come Home" and wound
up by singing a melody- about a black
crow, which he confided to his auditors
he had learned at ' kindergarten in his
childhood's" 'Â¦ happy^ days.,. Uncle George
helped to add sunshine to" one of tho
pleasantest days ever spent by the rail
road men. As an orator- he proved a bril
liant success and during his remaining
years the old gentleman will be fre
quently, invited to give further details of
his experience as a member of the craft.
Two long trains were necessary to carry
the conductors, their friends and bounte
ous lunch baskets to the pretty picnic
groundson the Russian River.. It was a
select gathering of happy pleasure-seek
ers that illled the spacious park. After
luncheon the picnickers boated on the
river, danced in the open-air pavilion and
picked wild flowers. Â¦
When the aged orator of the day mount
ed the platform he was given a hearty
welcome. He was introduced to his audi
ence in a neat speech -by Captain Dave
McLaughlin. Uncle George's apology for
having a typewritten speech won favor
with the jolly crowd. He said he did not
intend to address them extemporaneously
for fear of being completely carried away
by his own eloquence and not getting
back in time for the balance of the en
tertainment. He also confessed that a
lovely typewriter wrote out his thoughts.
"Uncle George further claimed that it
would take him fifteen minutes to read
his speech and his auditors would be sur
prised to learn that he knew so much in
such short time. He encouraged his au
dience to applaud whenever they felt like
it. These witty sallies paved the way for
Uncle George paused In his speech to
recite "When the Cows Come Home,"
which was received with warm applause.
He then continued his interesting narra
tive. He told of his going north to de
velop a mine and being 1 induced by a fel
low townsman to drop it and go railroad
ing on the "R" road in Sacramento. Ho
told of the completion of the road and the
banquet at Folsom, which celebrated tht?
event. Continuing he said:
"That great road was twenty-two miles
long. It cost $2 to ride from one end of
it to the other and 25 cents additional if
the passenger had not secured his ticket
at the office. At times some Inquisitive
passenger would ask what became of that
extra two bits. when, Â¦with that politeness
for which railroad conductors are famous
the world over, I would inform him it was
none of his business. All that was re
quired of him was to pay It. I would at
terd to Its final disposition. Last week I
saw a San Francisco paper stated that I
used to punch tickets on the Sacramento
Valley Railroad, but I deny the soft im
peachment, for there was no ticket punch,
in those days During my time of service
three boards of directors died poor. Di
rectors might come and directors might
go, but the conductor went right along as
if nothing had happened.
"After my nine years of service I grad
uated and went to keeping a hotel. In
four years I was ready to graduate from
the business. A friend asked me what I
had cleared in the business and I fold
him confidentially that I cleared a three
mil fence In Retting away from the Sher

will now be able to join you in whatever

the oration, which created much merri
ment. At the outset he said:
"In the lives of all great men there
comes a time when he is lost in wonder
as to where he is 'at,' and that's what's
the matter with me: inasmuch as the
honor conferred upon me to-day is so
overwhelming that it almost takes my
breath away. However, with the modesty
which has always been the predominant
trait of the average railroad conductor I
will be proud to say that in all well reg
ulated communities the man who is qual
ified for a railroad conductor would . be
a success in any other calling in Hfe anU
could live without the railroads, but a
railroad without a conductor would be a.
dead' failure. I will therefore tell you
about myself and later on wiH tell you
about the first railroad built on this side
of the continent, of which I was con
ductor for nine years.
"Regarding myself I have from very
pood authority that I was born very early
in life and in the history of the worM
there is no event recorded of such vital
importance to myself as my first birth
day. I have been told by those who were
present at the time that It was a howling
success and I was admitted to have been
the star howler. From that time I be
gan to grow and I have been growing
ever since. Sometimes in size and weight,
always in years and finally in importance,
which is consummated to-day by this
crowning glory of my eighty-three years
of eventful life in being honored by your
invitation to address you as the first rail
road conductor of the first railroad built
on the shores of the "Western continent.
Excuse me for spreading myself here,
but that was a great road.
"I will now gradually lead you up step
by step to the building and completion of
that road â which was then looked upon aa
one of the wonders of the age â and my
connection with It. I arrived in San Fran
cisco in 1S51. and as General Jackson won
the famous battle at New Orleans on that
date the celebration of the two anniver
saries made things very lively in the city
of the Golden Gate. There was 'a hot
time in the old town' for four or five
days and nights, for those were the time*
.when an anniversary could. be celebrated
on a very slight provocation:"

GRACE ADDISON VROOM does not propose to allow, the statement of Maud
Morrell to the effect that she was forced to sign a confession of improper
conduct with Frederic Vro'om at the point of a pistol by the infuriated wife
of the actor to go unchallenged. She declares emphatically that Miss Mor
rell's. statement is not o/ily false but that she wrote as well as signed the confes
sion and that a pistol had no part in the affair.,
"I did not'threaten her with a revolver," said Mrs. Vroom. "I did not have
a revolver with me. I could have killed her by strangling her If I had wanted
to, but I did not. Fwanted to let her know that I knew of the wrong she was do
ing and I wanted her to stop it. She was so little and so weak that I would not
have injured her any more than I would have plucked the wings off a fly. I
choked her and she cried out, 'Oh, Mrs. Vroom, don't do' that; don't do that,' and
I threw her from me and she fell on the bed.
"Maud Morrell was rooming in a respectable house. 907 Geary street, and I
had Just closed a week's performance at the Dewey Theater in Oakland on the
morning of May 7. I came to San Francisco Sunday night after the performance
and met my detective. He told me that my husband had already gone into the house
and room of Maud Morrell. I had another detective, who was a woman, in the
house. She had engaged a room adjoining that of Miss Morrell. She had been
there several times at night and during the day, especially when Miss Morrell
was entertaining my husband in the next room.
"If I had wanted to kill Maud Morrell I could have gone into the house that
Sunday night and shot both her and my husband.
"My husband came out of the house and went to his office. It was about 8:30
o'clock that I went to Maud Morrell's room. She was still in bed. I,knocked at
the door. Miss Morrell herself came to the door and as soon as she saw me she
threw up her hands and exclaimed, 'Oh, Mrs. Vroom!' At the same time she looked
white and troubled.
"I seized her by the throat and shook her thoroughly. She did not scream. I
choked her until my fingers got numb and then threw her on the bed, where she
lay moaning and crying and begging for mercy. I said to her, '"Why did you re
ceive my husband under an assumed name and break up my home and destroy
my life?'
"She said that she had been deceived. There was no denial. I asked her
how she could be deceived when I was his wife. She said, 'I don't know. I
cared for Mr. Vroom.' She threw herself at my feet again and cried and sobbed
and moaned as if her heart would break.
"I made a search of the room and I actually found things which belonged
to me and which the lying husband of mine had stolen from me and given to
her. I could have choked her to death as she lay there helpless, but I kept
my resolve not to harm the woman because she was so little, so cowardly and
so helpless. But when I showed her that my husband had given her my own
property her collapse was most complete, and it seemed to me as if she would
die.
"I roused her, however, and she said she would never see Mr. Vroom again.
I told her that was not satisfactory. I told her that she was accursed. I
cursed her in a dozen different ways. I prayed that she might never know what
honest love was; that she might forfeit, as she had forfeited the respect of any
friends she ever had and that If she ever did {all in love that her love might
be turned to despair. I told her that I hoped that anything she touched would
wither and that her life might enfl In ignomy and shame, and as barren as
mine.
"She reached for a piece of paper and tore it in halves and wrote on it at
my suggestion:
" 'I promise never to meet Mr. Vroom again.' I told her that that was not
enough. She then turned the piece of paper and wrote on the back of it: 'I
promise to see Mr. Vroom no more, nor will 1 write to him.' She signed 'Maud
Morrell.' May 7. 1900.'
"I was with her an hour and a half and then I left her alone with her con
science and the knowledge that she had now a reputation that was known to
the world as blasted. That was punishment enough for her. I have never
seen her since. But she was as untruthful in her statement as she was false
in her conduct. I know that since then she has had communication with my
husband.
"I told my husband all I knew and he turned and struck me fiercely on
the side of the head .ind said. 'You can't get out of here. You shan't leavo
here.' As he said that I shot him."

The sportsmanlike spirit manifested by
the Olympic Club Wheelmen In giving
up all claim to the relay cup which they
won in last Sunday's race, because they
had unintentionally committed a tech
nical violation of the racing rules in not
carrying the packet across the tape, has
been highly commended by cyclers in
general and the clubs in particular. One
of the most prominent wheelmen In the
Asociation, speaking of the affair, said
yesterday:
"It showed that the Olympics had the
desire to live up to their agreement with
other contesting clubs, in every particu
lar. Such an action will go a long way
toward promoting the sport and cement
ing the friendship now existing between
the clubs.
"No rules can be made so complete that
slight violations of them are avoidable,
and it has been customary to overlook
such errors. In this case,' however, the
Olympics declined to accept the majman
lmlty of the clubs and willingly offered
the 'trophy to the Garden City Club,
which came in second, because of the
violation of rule 10. It was a very sports
manlike thing to do. The Garden Citya
accepted the cup in the spirit in which
it was surrendered and the Bay Citys
are agreeable to the arrangement, so
every one Is satisfied."
The Bay City Wheelmen tendered a
banquet last night to' Dr. E. T.. Mervy,
an old-time member, who Is about to de
part for /Cape Nome. , Dr. Mervey has
been prominent in the club's social and
racing life, and counts his friends by the

Pennsylvania and California Athletic
Teams Postpone Their Field
PHILADELPHIA. May 19.â A continu
ous fall of rain to-day caused a postpone
ment of the dual games between the Uni
versity of California and the University
of Tennnsylvania and also the baseball
game between Pennsylvania and Harvard.
An effort will be made to arrange a future
date with California, and Harvard has
asked permission from Cambridge to re
main until Monday to play the game.
There was great disappointment in the
catnp of the Oulifornians, as they were
anxious to see how many points they
could snatch from the Quakers. They
also were anxious to f>ee Plaw, the pride
of California, compete with McCracken,
the cliampion of the East. These two
stars will meet in the intercollegiate con
tests next Saturday.
On Monday the wearers of the blue ana
gold will start training for the Mott Ha
ven games; A challenge has been sent to
Georgetown University, but as yet no an
swer" has been received. If they accept
the games will take place on Monday.
California stands, a very good chance or
winning from Georgetown. The latter s
strongest man is Duffy, the great
sprinter. â¢ . ,
After much negotiation it has been de
cided to 1 meet Pennsylvania on Monday,
Mav 28. The baseball game botwpon
Pennsylvania and Harvard also has been
postpo'ned until the afternoon of this date.
body remarked that the elder Herrmann,
the magician, might easily have made a.
fortune had he turned his attention to
gambling.
"I've heard that before." said one of the
party, chuckling-, "and it always amused
me. Why, my dear sir, Alexander Herr
mann was one of the poorest poker play
ers that ever 'drew to a bobtail. He liked
a social game and plugged av/ay at it all
his life, but he was never anything but
a raw amateur. Good poker players are
born, ana it simply wasn't in him. As far
as being able to manipulate the cards was
concerned, he couldn't do it, even had he
been so disposed, which of course he was
n't. He could perform wonderful tricks,
but th it class of work is something en
tirely different from what is called ad
vantage playing. I have known four or
five fine sleipht-of-hand performers, and
not one of them could do a thing with the
deck in an ordinary game. To do suc
cessful crooked work In ?hort cards re
quires not only great dexterity of a kind
entirely distinct from stage tricks, but
also a peculiar temoerament. All the men
who became famous for that sort of thine:
In the old days were of the same general
type, and when I come to think about it,
those I knew looked more or less alike.
They could perform extraordinary feats,
but it required years of practice and set
ting everything else aside: no professional
Juggler could spare the time to learn.
"The best proof that Herrmann was un
familiar with the tricks of the card table
is that he was continually betnff made
the victim. He made no secret of the fact
that he had been fleeced time and again
and I happened to know personally that
he was once swindled out of a consider
able amount by one of the oldest and
stalest devices known to the fraternity.
When the thins was explained to him
afterward he was deeply disgusted, but
he had never suspected it at the time."

THE LOCAL TEAM
A One-Sided Game Which
Meant a Funeral for Har
ris' Erratic Nine.
Sacramento Stickmen Hit Well and
Hard and Frisco Was Not In
the Running at Any
Time.
?
Sacramento 1O, San Francisco 1.
Jay Hughes and nasty errors won for
the Senators the tlrst game of the series
with the local team played yesterday
afternoon at Recreation Park. Iburgr be
gan the slab act for Hank's team, but in
the fifth he was replaced by the fireman.
Hank's sacred nine were switched
around. Krug going into shortstop and
IJrockhoff being sent to the center terri
tory. Krus played a star game, especial
ly "as to his throwing, which was of a
hiph class quality. Frisco's new .captain,
".Blue Ribbun" Pabst, made his initial
performance and was well received by
the crowd.
The "champs" started to work in the
first. McLaughlin took a constitutional
and advanced two stations on Deveraux's
hit, scoring on Riley's error at second to
stall Deveraux. *
Frisco played the calcium act for a few
moments in the third and the local fan
atics palpitated with expectancy. "Blue
Ribbon" Pabst, who rolled out a hit in the
former inning, had the glittering chance
to distinguish himself by scoring some
fif the three men who covered the. sacks
for Frisco, but all he did was to cut
streaks in the atmosphere and the side
â¢ru retired. Sacramento fareil better in
this inning. Due to some fulsome errors
by Rube Levy and Brockhoff, McLaugh
lin. Eagan and Hanlon crossed the rubber.
By way of improvement Urocknoff was
sent to center and lvrug brought Into the
infield.
In the fourth the Senators added an
ot.hrr brace of runs to their list and the
score stood ftâ 0.
The seventh meant something for Frisco
but much more for the visitors. Brork
hoff reached the iirst sack on Devcraux's
error, coursing the bags on Hildebrand's
single. In this inning Sacramento had the
bags filled twice when the first two outs
were made, but a hit by Stulz scored
Stanley and Doyle. Pyne also scored. The
score:

last course, between Little Sister and

day. The dogs were well matched and
their work was clever and in a short tlnv>
the scores ran up. Little Sister was tho
victor, having ten points* to her credit,
while Palmflower had eight.
"Eventually thlng3 simmered down to
Central America, and then by process of
elimination to Spanish Honduras. That
was the final stronghold of the fugitive,
but In 1SDS the Congress of the nation ap
proved a new treaty clause, containing
thÂ© usual extradition provisions. So. as
I said before, there Is now no city of
refuge on the face of the earth. The man
with a warrant goes wheresoever he
lists."â New Orleans Times-Democrat.
"A very Interesting fact of modern Ufa
that seems to have escaped attention." re
marked a New Orleans lawyer thÂ© other
day_"ia that the world has wiped Its last
city*bf refuge oft the map. There la no
longer any spot on the globe where our
fugitives from justice are safe from ex
tradition. When I first began to practice*
law an American criminal of retirins dis
position had a wide range of choice in the
matter of foreign residence. Spain, Tur
key. Algiers, Japan. Holland, Chile. Ecua
dor, the Philippines. Cuba and all of Cen
tral America, except British Honduras,
guaranteed security to assorted brands of,
fugitives, from murderers down, and the
list of resorts open to 'simple embezzlers
was very much larger. For years, you re
member, every runaway bank cashier
made a bee line for Canada, and the thing
got to be a standing joke, like the mother
in-law gag and the merry quips about
plumbers. Nevertheless, the circle kept
steadily contracting, and one by one the
different countries entered Into mutual
treaties and put up the bars, so the
American crook who wanted a change of
air began to find himself In the position of
Dick Swiveller, when he checked off the
London streets he couldn't traverse with
out meeting creditors. It was mighty
hard work to figure out a safe Itinerary.
Canada hung tenaciously to the tourist
trade, but at last she passed a law against
bringing stolen property into the Do
minion that practically excluded the flit
ting banker. Japan was one of the last
of the distant powers to adopt a treaty
covering what are called 'crimes against
property,* and the new proviso was a
severe blow to felonious gentlemen In deli
cate health. It robbed them of the balmy
climate of Yokohama.
No City of Refuge Left.
"What do you think of that plan to run
a newspaper on Christian principles?"

Nearly a hundred courses were run on
the field yesterday at Union Park without
hitch or delay. The puppy stake was run
down twice, leaving twelve still in to
fight for supremacy to-day. Curtis &
Son's Anchor is picked as the probable
winner, with David Dillon's Hughie puppy
Challenge? the most likely candidate for
second place honors. Anchor showed a
good flight of speed, and as he has been
started in several open stakes recently he
has had a fair amount, of the necessary
experience on the field. With so many
dogs of unknown, ability in the running
there, were the usual upsets in the bet
ting. Lioness beat Wee Waves; Silver
Cloud # beat Shadow, and Oriole beat
Brentwood Belle at odds of 2 to 1. In the
succeeding round The Jester beat Oriole
at 2 to 1 and Ranee beat Lioness at 5
to 4. /

margin of one point. Bald Kagle beat

"The strength of an organ depends upon
its use" applies to the teeth as It does to
any other part of the body. The masti
cation of coarse food may wear tho grind
ing surfaces, but this does not Interfere
with their functions, as Is shown by the
teeth of the Eskimos â ground down In
many cases to the gum., yet showing no
signs of decay. The same condition may
be seen in the teeth of the California In
dian. Nature -has provided for the wear
of -the tooth by building from the Inside,
when the pulp which occupies the center
of the tooth is approached. â New York
Herald.
It is a curious fact that most people In
chewing use one side of the mouth more
than the other. This can be traced usu
ally to some defect on the unused side,
but the habitual use of one side of the
mouth Is detrimental to the opposite sldo
and to the health generally, j
The loss of a tooth adds a wrinkle to the
face. This Is not so apparent, perhaps, in
youth as in middle age, although even in
the youthful the loss of a cuspid, or eye
tooth, Is plainly Indicated by a line ex
tending from the wing of the nose to the
angle of the mouth. This is caused by the
shrinking away of the prominence which
outlined the root of the tooth.
When one tooth has been extracted you
have really lost two. Teeth cut and grind.
The grinding teeth may be likened to mill
stonesâone acting upon the other. Re
move a tooth and the opposite organ is
without a function. It has nothing to
grind against. It will lengthen slightly,
as though in search of a mate, and in the
case of the gnawing animals the loss of
an incisor usually results in the death of
the animal. The opposing tooth, elongat
ing, prevents the use of the remaining
teeth, or, as frequently happens to rab
bits, the tooth, having no work to do,
curves upward until it penetrates the
skull. Luckily, our teeth are limited as
to their growth.
The average individual values a tooth
lightly, even as an object of utility, In its
natural setting, and Its loss is considered
a trivial matter unless it happens to be a
front tooth. Not until nearly all the teeth
have been destroyed by decay or removed
by the forceps does one realize what has
happened.

that the dollar is of vital Importance to
the poor woman." I continued.
"It Is also evident that she was inex
cusably careless." replied Mrs. Kashmore.
"Besides," she added, "you ought to know
that psychic charity has nothing to do
with money."
Mr. Biff. Shady (who a week ago hart
been pointed out to me as the political
"boss of the Fifth Ward"), sitting near
us, here took a dollar from his pocket
and dropping it Into the woman's lap im
mediately walked out of the car in an
embarrassed manner.
"I wonder," said I. questionably, "of
what charity society Mr. Biff Shady Is a
member?"
Mrs. Kashmore refused to reply.
"It seems to be the real thing. I sug
gested, "even if it does cover a multitude
of sins."
The silence on Mrs. Kashmore's part
became oppressive, and I was plaii that
the car had reached ir.y corner. â Life.

The sensation of the evening was when
A. Hickmott. who up to a short time ago
was a prominent canner came forward
with an oflV-r to invest flO.<XK> in an in
dependent cannery, the money to be ready
0A.KLAXD, May 19.â The fruit
growers of Alameda County have
organized to fight the combined
canneries, which threaten by the
low price offered for the product
of the orchards to freeze the fruit men
out of business. To-night over one hun
dred of the leading growers of Eden
Township met In the S:in Leaiidro City
Hall and formed an association, the ob
ject of which will be to establish an In
dependent cannery for the handling of
the product of their orchards. Many of
the growers were heard in speeches which
show the fervor of the orchardists In
their efforts to escape the tyranny of the
combine.
As it was necessary to devise plans for
the disposal of the cherry crop of this
year. It was decided to appoint a commit
tee of three from each of the districts of
the township â San Leandro, San Lorenzo
and Haywards â to secure an option on as
much of the fruit as possible and go with
the option to the combine or to any indi
vidual canner for the best price obtain-
to throw off the yoke that bound them to
their oppressors. He said that cherries
could not be grown at a profit for 2^
cents a pound, the price offered by the
combine. Ordinary black cherries could
be grown for 4 cents, but for Royal Annes
at least 7V& cents should be received.
J. H. Begier also denounced the efforts
of the canners to combine to squeeze the
fruit men. He could not, he said, grow
cherries at the price offered by the can
ners, and it was to the interest of the
growers to establish a cannery where they
could preserve their product and dispose
of it afterward to jobbers, who were cer
tain of a market, as they had the world
In which to eet rid of it.
Daniel McCarthy, who was elected per
manent secretary of the association, took
an active part in the discussion and made
several valuable suggestions as to the
best plans for going ahead In the Import
ant matter that confronted the fruit
growers of Alameda ' County. Among
those who spoke in earnest terms were:
C. Hastings. Daniel McCarthy, Georpe
Smith, A. Hickmott, J. H. Begier, I. B.
Parsons, Wililam Meek and A. B. Cary.
This delegation will confer with the
canners and see what rates can be had
for cherries. They will secure the best
terms possible and report back to the as
sociation next Tuesday evening.

able. With 75 per cent of the total output
of the county it would be possible to dic

A constitution and by-laws was then
adopted, which declared the name of the
association to be the Alameda County Bay
District Fruit Growers' Association. It
was set forth that the objects of the asso

combine which la at present attempting to
lower the already too low price of fruit,
and to deviso other means for the disposal
of the fruit than to accede to the de

prominent grower, urged the orchard- men

CHICAGO. May Â».â Liverpool was still
whooping It up for Baden-Powell to-day and
forgot the deal in grain, and in the absence of*
this usual hint to go one way or the other the
market here opened the session unchanged,
July at 67%Â®67Hc. The Northwest was with
out rain. Just as It has been for some time. It
renewed Its wailing- and looked through gloomy
glasses at the prospect of seed dying from
drought In the ground. The Southwest com
plained of recent liberal rains. In addition
Illinois reported damage from the Hessian fly
These tidings were enough to worry shorts"
and under pressure of covering the price of
July was forced up to 67%c. The corn weak
ness later made Itself felt and many of the
early purchases were thrown on the market
again, July selling off to 67a The close was
steady st 67<Â§67%c, He under yesterday. Trade
throughout the session was quiet. .
Corn was quiet but firm for an hour, , but
weak after that. The weakness was duo to
pressure of longr corn and too much rain in
the Weet- July closed heavy, down
at 3Sc.
There was very little trading In oats. July
closed a shade- lower. >
Provisions were very qujet but fairly steady.
The opening was a trifle lower, because of
light nog receipts. July pork closed* with . a

Chicago Grain Market.
NEW YORK. May 13.â The stock market
xsaintalsed n fairly good speculative tone to
day. In spite of the continued discouragement :
reported by the mercantile ayenciea over the ',
course of commodity prices. Railroad Btocks
generally are bisher on the day to the extent
of a fraction und some of the specialties show
Jarjrer char.ee*. Sugar was the leader of the
market without ar.y news to account for its
strength beyond the suggestive parallel that
rr.igbt be Crawn between its case and that of
the New York Gas Companies, whese costly
conflict seems to be ended. With the profitable
per:cd of the year approaching to the Sujaj
trade, it is natural to suppose that the incen
tive to settling a contest that takes away the
profit* of the business is augmented. Consoli
dated Gas reflected the pressure of apeculatlve
r â¢-Â¦:-:. 2 :r.(r and the Tobacco stocks showed signs
cf weakness. The local traction stocks con
tinued fctrong. The market was largely one
Icf fcjjeclaltie*. There was some demand for
the Vanderbilt stocks, apparently en the Re
port Â«1 return from Europe of Â«VIl!iam K. Van
dert/tlt, which was denied after the close.
Union Pacific gained a lar^e fraction. Bur-
ISHRt&n and Norfolk and Western halted in the
advance, which was the feature of yesterday's
market, while traders took their profits. The
bond market showed a decided improvement,
both in the volume of the demand and the
prices brought. The sharp advance In Gov
ernment bends was, of course, in response to
the announcement from XVashington of the
calling of the extended 2 per cents.
Prlcee of raitrofcd stocks have partly recov
ered this we*k th* loeses Incurred last week.
In the Industrial department of the stock list,
on the contrary, there have been some formid
abla inroads upon prices. Business has been
largely in professional hands and the volume
of draUncs has been less than half a million
shares a day on an average. A large part of
the demand was evidently from the bears, who
had oversold the market on the previous de
cline. Professiunal manipulation against the
ehcrt* was a factor In tfce advance. After the
trickle of the week the market showed renewed
tendency to sag with the satisfaction of the
<J<-mc.nd from the ehort Interest nnd with the
efforts making- to realize by professional trad
ers who had turned bulls for a time. The
London money market found unexpected relief
by the receipt of $5,000,000 in Rueelan geld and
this has resulted In some buying for London
account In Serf York, which has been a ius
tii'r.ir.K influence each day In the New York
market. It has also resulted in alleviating the
fear* cf a heavy drain of gold from New York
to relieve the European money markets, which
xn!(rht ui>sÂ«t the home market. - '
Â¦*^Crop prospects are playing: an Imposing: part
In wperulative considerations and the firmness
of Wes^err railroad rhares has been helped by
this consideration. Wall street, nevertheless.
continues rather depressed and uncertain, due
to the obvious fact that buying of commodities
Is trtlll withheld waiting for indications that
bottom prices have been reached.
The fact that investment buying of bonds *ias
b*Â»*n dull in npite of low rates for money has
rÂ«â n a discouraclEt* factor in the stock mar
ket.

NEW YORK. May IS.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says: Tho
city was seised with Mafeking insanity to-day
and the caturnalia. exceeded even that follow
ing the relief of Ladysmith. The Exchange was
swimming in champagne and flag-flourishing,
trumpet-blowing and patriotic anthems super
seded business. The tone was cheerful, but it
was almost impossible to obtain prices.
London 'Market.
NEW YORK. May 19.â ThÂ« Financier says:
The changes In the totals of thÂ« Clearing-house
bonks for the we^k ending May 19 are unim
portant. The principal feature is a gain of
$1,666,000 In cash, due principally to the move
ment of Interior funds to this center. Pension
payments by tho Treasury offset the gold with
drawn for export and the banks really ended
the week as creditors In this respect. The rapid
rise In the loan total noted over the last two
months Is seemingly at an end. Following a
email decrease for the week ending May 12 the
banks have made a slight expansion of S743.0OO
during the last six days, but this is due to local
causes. The deposit item is $1,374,000 higher
and the week closed with a reserve of $L 222,500
in excess of tho previous statement, making
the total surplus $16,556,225. There Is reason
to believe that the gold export movement Ib
at an end. and as Western banks are report
ing a remarkably easy condition of the money
market the inference is that New York will
receive some heavy currency shipments before
the crop season opens. The redemption of the
outstanding 2 per cent extension bonds by tho
Treasury will also operate in the direction of
easing the market, so that the future appears
to favor low rates. It la not to be forcotten.
however, that the Presidential campaign Is
nearly at hand, and as this will create more
or less disturbance prudent borrowers are tak
ing advantage of tho present opportunity in
order to secure themselves against a possible
hard market later on. Of course It Is impos
sible to estimate how much money will be
needed In the fall for crop purposes, but wlm
the strengthened position of the Western banks
and the poeslbility of adding to present sup
plies of funds through the issue of new bank
notes anytb:ng approaching etrlngency, even
with a Pret lentlal ejection impending, is out
of the quest x '
At any rate, r- needing that domestic supplies
of currency tho.id be absorbed In various ways.
It will bÂ« an easy matter to recall some of
the lm/nense. sums now being loaned to Europe
on current trade balances. The very fact that
merchandise exports have exceeded imports in
three years by nearly $1,500,000,000 shows that
gold Imports can be forced at any time.

Jacob Wollner's circular safs: j
"Our wool market is still dull, but there is
a little more looking around for choice north
ern wool. About 60,000 pounds were bought by
an Eastern purchasing broker from 15c to 16c.
There is a little more Inquiry for scoured wool,
but prices are nominal.
"Eastern markets are reported quiet, with
some sales on a lower basis.
"London sales, which opened tho 8th inst.
from 5 to 10 per cent lower, have somewhat
strengthened as the sale progresses. One hun
dred thousand bales will be withdrawn from
this sale, as the consignees expected higher
prices, and if all the wools which were put
in this sale had been offered there would have
been quite a slump in the market."

City Attorney Says Ordinance Grant*
ing Right of Way on Illinois
Street Is Valid.
The City Attorney filed an opinion yeÂ»
terday with the Board of Supervisors In *
which he holds that if the proper enact
ing clause is inserted in the proposed or-*
dinance granting a franchise to the San
Francisco and San Joaquin Railway Com
pany to construct and operate a railroad
along Illinois street it will be entirely
valid. The opinion continues:
"The franchise is for forty-five years,
but under the charter the city can grant
franchises to street railways for but
twenty-five years. That the railroad to
be operated on Illinois street is not a
Btreet railway should affirmatively appeaz
to save possible question later."
VALLEY ROAD WILL BE

Assemblyman De Lancie
Will Take His Place as
Deputy Marshal.
Milt Green Obtains the Appointment,
It Is Said, on Behalf of His
Friend, United States
Senator Perkins.
ââ¢ |
The dull thud of the political ax will be
heard on June 1 in the office of United
States Marshal John II. Shine, and the
head of Deputy United States Marshal
Harry Mofiitt will roll into the basket.
His official shoes will be worn by Richard
de Lancie, Assemblyman' from Butte
County. It is understood that Mr. de
Lancie'a appointment was asked for by
Senator Perkins through Milt Green.
Mr. de Lancie bears an excellent repu
tation and is no stranger to official life.
He served for a while as deputy Bheritt
in Butte County and was County Treas
urer for several years.
Deputy Marshal Moffltt has held his
present position for six years and- will
leave the ottlce with a first class record
and the best wishes of all with whom his
duties brought him into contact. Marshal
Shine remarked yesterday that Mr. Moffltt
was one of the best officers he ever met.
There are . no Indications of further
changes In the office in the near future,
but political thunderbolts have a habit ol
striking very suddenly, and there is no
knowing what may happen before the

As a sequel to the arrest cl Mrs. LouisÂ©
Kelso and Miss Mary Hilborn on Friday
night on complaint of Mme. Annette
lx>ulÂ»e HarbJdjre-ilaristajjy, 'who used to
be proprietor of a cloakhouse In Alameda,
a. search warrant case was heard yester
day by Judge Oalmniss. in which Mrs.
Maristany waÂ« the complainant and Miss
Hilborn, who Is also known as Mary Don
nelly, was the defendant.
Mrs. Maristany procured the eearch
warrant on Friday afternoon, after she
had swore to the complaints in Alameda
charging Miss Jillbom and Mrs. Kelso
with embtzzleraent. She sought to re
cover possession of a g&f skirt and tan
suit wnich she alleged Miss llllborn had
stolen from her. The articles were found
ax 4 CJrovn slrÂ»-et, where Miss Hilborn
resides. Mrs. Maristany, who accom
panied the ofacer. saw a jacket which she
said bad also been stolen from her, but as
it was r.ut Induced in the warrant the
officer refused to taie it.
There wajs a lively scene between the
worn in whenthey faced <;aeh other In court.
Miss Hilborn said Mr?. Maristany had pre
sented her with the skirt, tan suit, jacket, a
hat and globes before she left fjr the t-ast
about two m<>nths ago for reasons txeet
known to herself. Sue v.-as surprised to
learn that the articles had been charged
up against her. She produced a letter she
had received from Mrs. Maristany in an
swer to one she had written her, in which
ehe acknowledged that she had not done
enough for her and said It was all a mis
take.
ishe scornfully denied the accusation of
embezzling $23 charged against her and,
gTrispine Sirs. Maristany by the arm.
said: "You dare not look me in the eyes
and say 1 stole that money."
Mrs. llaristany did not accept the chal
lenge, and retorted: "I am looking at the
Judge and not at you."
Mrs. MorlPtany claims that the tan suit
In dispute was not the one she had given
as a present to Miss Hilborn. Bhe said
that when she was called East to her
mother an Inventory of the stock was
taken, and shortly after her husband
made another inventory and found about
J4Ii0 -worth of stuff missing. He had given
Miss Hilborn $23 to send to her, but it had
never reached her.
The Judpe, after listening patiently to
the two Â¦wompn, said It was a matter for
the civil courts and made an order that
the Fkizt and tan suit should be returned
to Miss Hilborn.
"That woman is an adventuress, your
Hnnor," said Miss Hilborn. "and I will
make her smart yet for having me ar
reste.1. She was to pay me $10 a. week for
traveling expenses, and I have never re
ceived a cent of It. The time has not yet
come for me to tel! what I know about
her."
Mis? Hilborn alletred that Mrs. Marfp
tany went East to get a civorce from her
husband, and Mrs. Maristany charges
that Miss Hilborn Is married and Is to
pet a dlroroe from her husband so that
sh*Â» ran marry another man who Is a
friord of Mr. Maristany.
Mrs. Maristany also secured a search
warrant for the recovery of $150 worth of
articlP5 which she alleges were 6tolen
from her by Mrs. Louise Kelso. or Lura
Walsh as she is named In the complaint.
The articles Â¦were taken from 1520 Geary
street, where Mrs. Kelso resides, and are
now In the possession of the property

WOMEN PREPARE
FOR A BITTER
WAR IN COURT
Mary Hilborn Scores First
Point Against Mrs.
Maristany. -
There is a division of opinion In the
National Guard as to the necessity of .a
division camp this year and as to the pos
sibility of running a division camp for
one vreek. Including transportation from
all parts of the State to Santa Cruz and
from Santa Cruz to the respective loca
tions of the several organizations, on $28,
000. At division headquarters it is stated
that It can be done, while others who are
looked upon as "facts and figures" In
camp matters say that that allowance is
not sufficient to meet the demands. Then
there are many who declare that there is
no necessity at this time for such^a gath
ering of the men of the various organiza
tions, as the majority of them would not
learn anything that they did not learn
during the time they were volunteers In
the Spanish-American war and learned it
more thoroughly than could be taught
them in eight days. The flle of the or
ganization is opposed to such a camp.
Those who compose that very important
part of the guard say that If the authori
ties have SSt.UCri to spend they would better
use the money for the purpose of putting
the guard on an effective basis instead of
getting up an affair for the sole purpose
of gratifying the ambition of three or four
of the higher officers. The First Regiment
of infantry is not in a condition to go
into camp nor is it possible to get it
ready by July unless it is the desire to
send it as was Faistaff's command, ail
rags and tatters.
