country understood the policy of her Ma

was to carry on with absolute firmness
and determination the measures taken to
preserve the country's Interests.
"The allies, about 12,000 strong, attacked
the Chinese intrenched position at Hslku,
about two miles outside of Tientsin, early
this morning. The Chinese were driven
out and retired northward, pursued by the
allies, who occupied Peitsang. ' Transports

Mr. Broderick also read the following

the Austrian gunboat Zenta, now in Chi

there were no casualties among the sixty
men from the Zenta who were engaged.

which he has cabled. CHAFFER"
THROUGH Minister Wu the United States Government addressed last evening a vig
orous warning- to the Chinese officials in Peking that they would be held personally ac
countable for the safety of Ministers there. It was pointed out that if the envoys could
not be protected in the easily defended portion of Peking it was futile to suggest escorting
them to the coast. While not in a diplomatic sense an ultimatum, this memorandum is re
garded as, affording a last opportunity for the Chinese Government to arrange matters ex
cept on a basis of dictation by the powers after the entry of their troops into the capital.
In response to a demand made a month ago by the United States, and probably actu
ated by the beginning of the allies' advance, if not also by the reverse suffered by its forces at
Peitsang on Sunday, the Chinese Government has issued an edict opening free communica
tion with the Ministers in Peking, as a result of which a cipher message was sent from -Wash
ington last evening to Minister Conger.
Advices from the British Minister in Peking received in London yesterday state â¢ that
on Friday all was well, though intermittent rifle fire by the Chinese troops and Boxers had
continued since the cessation of shell fire on July 16. Two hundred women and children are
among the refugees in the British legation. The total casualties there have been 6o killed and
I io wounded.
Further details of the battle at Peitsang on Sunday encourage the belief that the Chi
nese resistance was less than at first supposed. Washington thinks the allies' advance guard
has already reached Yansun, about one-third of the distance from Tientsin to Peking.
Reports from General Chaffee and Admiral Remey show that the Americans were
unable to participate in the fight. The early reports of seven hours of battle and heavy
losses of the allies seem to be without foundation.
Referring to the attacks on the legations in Peking the Queen's speech yesterday on
the prorogation of the British Parliament says: "The utmost efforts will be made by myself
and my allies to visit with worthy punishment the authors of this unexampled crime."
Field Marshal Count von Waldersee is to be sent to China to lead the German troops
there, and it is reported at Berlin and is generally believed in other European capitals that he
will be made commander in chief of the allied forces.

This gives a some what, different aspect
to the battle at Peitsang on the 5th. as it
indicates that the American detachment
took no part in that engagement, not hav

had effected the capture of the city. Ad

statement that Yangtsun is the next ob

LONDON. Aug. 9. 4 a. m.â Beyond the
official dispatches given out yester
day morning the papers contain no
information of importance from
China. Thanks to the dispatches
of Sir Claude Macdonald and Rear Ad
miral Bruce there is a general disposition
to take a more hopeful view of the situa
tion.
The report of the appointment of Field
Marshal Count von Waldersee as com
xr,ander in chief of the international forces
meels with general approval.
The Rome correspondent of the Daily
Mail announces the reception there of
official dispatches from the Italian Min
ister in Peking, asserting that he lelt
Peking on July 31. presumably for Tien
tsin. This, however. Is so utterly at
variance with the action and intentions of
the other Ministers heard from that H
eeems almost incredible. If true It opens
tip an Interesting field of speculation con
cerning the fate of the Italian represen
tative.
The Chinese legation believes that the
jnembers of the foreign legations have
jiot yet left Peking, but that they -will do
6O. and declares that the edict would not
have b^en Issued had not the foreign Min
isters fiigr.ific-d a willingness to accept the
escort.
The Shanghai correspondent of the
Dailj' News, wiring yesterday, says:
â¢â¢United States Consul Goodnow strong
ly opposes Admiral Seymour's intention to
land 3000 troops on the ground that such
an act would not be warranted by the
circumstances and wouid be likely to
create trouble. M. Eezaure, the French
Consul, agrees to the arrangement, but
eays that if the British land forces the
French will do likewise. The Austriar.s
â¢will also land men. My personal opinion
Is that the landing of troops here at the
present time would be a grave mistake."
The Daily Chronicle, commenting upon
American criticism of the character of
the Chinese "news" printed in some Lon
don dallies, admits that the charges are
only too true, and that the practice of
certain papers in this respect are opposed
to the best traditions of British Journal

CALL BUREAU. WELLINGTON
HOTEL. WASHINGTON, Aug. 8.â
China has professedly complied
with Secretary Hay's demand that
the United States be permitted free
communication with Minister Conger, and
a mesrage was sent to-night to the Amer
ican diplomat in Peking, a duplicate go
ing to Consul General Gqodnow in Shang
hai instructing him to make every effort
to forward It. This message is In cipher,
and officials of the. Government are Jeal
ously guarding Its contents. If China per
mits the delivery of this dispatch and an
answer be received within a reasonable
time, much will have been' done toward
meeting the. wishes of this Government
and it will feel more disposed to act in
her behalf. 'At the same time," officials
are impressing. upon Minister" Wu that ; in
their opinion in permitting communication
between the American Minister and this
Government ; the Imperial .authorities are
doing.no more than is just and are allow
ing no more than Is due to the: American
Government and its representative. | In
his note of August 1' Secretary Hay stated
emphatically that "free communication
With our representative In Peking is de
manded as a matter of absolute right and
r.ot as a favor," and the message re
ceived yesterday from Minister Conger,
followed to-day by the presentation to
the State Department of the dispatch re
ceived by Minister Wu from the Taotal
of Shanghai, saying that an edict Issued
by the imperial . Government permits Min
isters free communication . in cipher in
dicates that the Chinese Government has
recognized the force of "the-. Secretary's
declaration. No doubt exists ' in official
circles that the | action of : the Chinese
Government was undoubtedly Influenced
by the firm tone of the Secretary's com
munication, followed.; by the advance of
the allies from -Tientsin. Speculation is
rife as to'the part^played by the reverse
of China at Peitsang in causing the im
perial. Government ; to Issue the edict. -It
was noted to-day that the edict is dated
August 5, and the Â¦ battle | of Peitsang ' oc
curred early on the morning of that day.
If there is telegraphic communication be
tween the Chinese military force in front
of the allies and the capital ' the success
of the allied troops probably had a direct
bearing . upon the concession made by the
Chinese Government. But . whatever the
cause; the result is regarded , as" most
gratifying, as distinctly showing that, the
Chinese Government is weakening," so that
hope is expressed that, anticipating the
success of the foreign troops, It will ac
cord that protection to foreign Ministers
upon which the United States, In common
with other powers, insists.' In his mes
sage" of August 1 Secretary Hay rfsserted
that "no negotiations would ; seem'; advis
able, until the ~ Chinese shall put; diplo
matic representatives; of the V powers -; in
full; and free communication- with their
respective Â¦ Governments and ' remove ' all
danger to their, lives and liberty."

WATCHING AND, WAITING
When Yangsun is taken the Interna
tional forces will have covered approxi
mately, one-third of the distance between
Telntsin and Peking. They will still have
about sixty miles ; of advance 'ahead of
them, however,, and about half of it will
be through the same character of low
overflowed land as that over which they
are now operating. Above Matou the
country becomes more rolling, though the
roads will not be any better,- as they are
practically deep .ditches, worn down some
times to the depth of eighteen feet or
more, in" the wet season almost impassa
ble and forming excellent protection for
Chinese - troops resisting the advance.

attacking forces could advance was ,so
restricted that the - Americans were not
able to get to the firing line at all. It
would seem that the Japanese troops,
which had the right of . line, practically
rushed the Chinamen out of their strongly
fortified position before the allies could
get Into position to take part in the bat
tle. After the battle the remainder of
Sunday was probably devoted to getting
supplies forward and arranging * for the
next advance/ which General Chaffee saya
was to be on Yangsun by way of the left
bank of the Peiho. It is believed that an
advance on -Yangsun has been made, by
this time, and it is hoped that the inter
national forces met with no more resist
ance than was encountered at Peitsang.

Chinese were being pursued.

It 13 rather heartsick work waiting

We are wondering what has happened to

General Miles Takes a Most
Serious View of the Situa-
tlon In the ;Floweru
.Kingdom.-
NEW.YORK. Aug. 8.â General Miles
to-day admitted that' it had been
his personal wish to.be sent to the
Philippines to take a general view
of; the situation, but said he did
not presume to understand why his ad
vice had been rejected thus far.
General Miles, discussing the situation,
said that he regarded it as very : serious.,
"China," he said, "is a bad country for
troops to move, through. ..-â¢ Serious obsta
cles are to be encountered in forwarding
munitions of war- and supplies.' I see a
force of 15,000 Chinese soldiers are report
ed to be within a day's march of Tientsin.
It Is possible they may strike in behind
the relief column and threaten its line of
communication. It would be a serious
matter were the 'column cut off, as there
is no supporting force to rush to Its aid."
He said the United States should be able
to get 5000 troops into China within, a
month.
' ', Continuing, General Miles said: "I am
not surprised at the fight the Chinese are
making. It : Is well known among those
who follow, events in* the "Flowery King

when Minister Conger's dispatch left
Peking and his view of the situation is
totally different from that entertained by
the imperial authorities, as he declares
that It will be certain death for the Min
isters to leave Peking, and no doubt is
entertained by the authorities that the
Chinese officials appreciate this as much
as do the Ministers themselves.. It is the
expectation of the Government that the
Ministers will remain in Peking until they
are relieved by the allied troops, and the
latter are moving as rapidly as passible,
so as to rescue them before their small
supply of ammunition and food gives out.

. This Is the commercial argument. It ts based
upon the theory that war can be rightly waged
for pecuniary advantage and that It Is profit
able to purchase trade by force and violence
Franklin denied both of those propositions!
When Lord Howe asserted that the acts of Par
liament, which brought on the Revolution, wete
necessary to prevent American trade from pass
ing Into foreign channels. Franklin said:
â¢To me It seems that neither the obtaining
nor retaining of any trade, however valuable.

means of extending and securing commerce ar
the goodness and cheapness of commodities
and that 'the profits of no trade can ever bÂ«

The permanent chairman of the last Repub
lican National Convention presented the pe

fare of those people -as a sacred trust, we re

Ths first argument Is addressed to the na
tion's pride and the second to the nation's
pocketbook. The third Is Intended for th-Â»
church member and the fourth for the partisan.
It Is sufficient answer to the first argument
to say that for more than a century this nation
has been a world power. For ten decades it has
been the most potent Influence In the world.
Not only has It been a world power, but It has
done more to affect tbe policies of the human
race than all the other nations of the world
combined. Because our Declaration of Inde
pendence was promulgated, others have bÂ«Â«n
promulgated; because the patriots of 1776 fought
for liberty, others have fought for It; becausa;
our constitution was adopted, other constltu-*.
tlons have been adopted. The growth of the '
principle of self-government, planted on Ameri

faith of the nineteenth centry It has mads
this nation conspicuous among the nations ami

nation has ever enjoyed. Nothing has b*-m

Growth of American Policy.
Some argue that American rale In tha Philip
pine islands will result In the better education
of the Filipinos. Be not deceived. If we ex
pect to maintain a colonial policy we shall not
find It to our advantage to educate thÂ» people.
The .educated Filipinos are now in revolt
against uÂ» and the most Ignorant ones have
made the least resistance to our domination I*
we are to govern them without their consent and
give thorn no voice In determining- the taxes
which they must pay. we dare not educata
them, lest they learn to read the Declaration of
Independence and the constitution of the United
States and mock us for our Inconsistency. The
principal arguments, however, advanced by
those who enter upon a defense of Imperialism
are: â¢ â¢
Firstâ That we must Improve the present op
portunity to become a world power and enter
Into International politics.
Secondâ That our commercial Interests In tha
Philippine Islands and In the Orient make It
nectary for us to hold the Islands perma
nently.
Thirdâ That the spread ot the Christian re
ligion will be facilitated by * colonial policy.
Fourthâ That there la no honorable retreat
from the position which the nation has taken.
which the nation rests: It can employ force In
stead of reason: tt can substitute might for
right; It can conquer weaker people: It can ex
ploit their lands, appropriate their property and
kill their people, bat It cannot repeal the moral
law or escape the punishment decreed for tha
violation of human rights.

inanimate earth has value, and when that earth
Is molded by the Divine Hand and stamped
with the likeness of. the Creator, It becomes a
fixture and passes with the soil? If govern
ments derive their Just powers from the con
sent of the governed. It Is impossible tu secure
title to people, either by force or by purchase.
We could extinguish Spain's title by treaty,
but If we hold title wÂ« must hold It by some
method consistent with our Ideas of govern
ment. When ' we made allies cf the Filipinos
and armed them to fight against Spain we
disputed Spain's title. If we bay Spain's tltio
we are not innocent purchasers. But even If
we had not disputed Spain's title, she could
transfer no greater title than she had, and
her title was based on force alone. ' We cannot
defend such a title, but as Spain gave us a
quitclaim deed we can honorably turn the
property over to the party In possession.
Whether any American official gave the Fili
pinos moral assurance of independence Is not
material. There can be no doubt that we ac
cepted and utilized the services of the Fili
pinos and that, when we did so we had full
knowledge that they were fighting for their own
independence, and I submit that history fur
nishes no example of turpitude baser than ours
if we now substitute our yoke for the Span

THE RACECOURSE, INDIANAPOLIS, WHERE THE NOTIFICATION
OF BRYAN AND STEVENSON WAS MADE.
The forcible annexation of territory to be gov
erned by arbitrary powers differs as much from
the acquisition of territory to be built up Into
States as a monarchy differs from a democracy, j
The Democratic party does not oppose expan
sion, when expansion enlarges the area of the
republic and Incorporates lands which can be
Eettled by American citizens, or adds to ' our
population people who are willing to, become
citizens and are capable of discharging their
duties as such. The acquisition of the Louis
iana territory, Florida, Texas and other tracts
which have been secured from time to time,
enlarged the republic, and the constitution
followed the flag Into the ne.w territory. It Is
now proposed to . seize : upon distant territory,
already more | densely I populated than our own
country. , and to force upon the people a ; gov
ernment for which there is no warrant in our
constitution or our laws. Even the argument
that this earth belongs to those who desire to
cultivate It and have the physical t power to
acquire It cannot be Invoked to " Justify the
appropriation of the Philippine Islands by the

sympathy for those who were fighting for civil
liberty. While our sphere of activity has been
limited to the Western hemisphere, our sympa
thies have not been bounded by the seas. We
have felt it due. to ourselves and to the world,
as well as to those who were struggling for the
right to govern themselvjs,-' to -proclaim the

of their own Independence Mt'ln every contest

"Three-quarters t pf Â¦ a , century ago, when ' our
nation- was -small,: the struggle of -Greece
aroused our people, and Webster and Clay gave
.eloquent expression to the universal desire for
Grecian independence. In 1896 all parties mani
fested a lively interest in the success of the
Cubans, but now, when a war is in progress In
South Africa which must result in the exten
sion of the monarchical Idea or In the triumph
of a republic, the advocates of imperialism in
this country dare not say a word In behalf of
1 the Boers. Sympathy for the Boers does not
arise from any unfriendliness toward England:
the American people are not unfriendly toward
the people of any nation. This sympathy Is
due to the fact that, as stated in our platform,
we believe in the principle of self-government,
and reject, as did our forefathers, the claims
of monarchy. If this nation surrenders Its
belief in the universal application of. the prin
ciples set forth In the Declaration of Inde
pendence it will lo^e. the prestige and Influence
which it has enjoyed : among nations as an
exponent of popular government.
Our opponents, conscious of the weakness of
their cause, seek to confuse Imperialism with
expansion, and have even dared to claim Jef
ferson as a supporter of their policy. Jefferson
spoke so freely and used language with such
precision that no one can be Ignorant of his
views. ; On one occasion he declared: "If there
be one principle more deeply rooted than any
other in the mind of every American It Is that
we should have nothing to do with conquest."
And again he said: "Conquest Is not In our
principles; it is inconsistent with. our govern
ment."
' What Is our, title! to; the! Philippine Islands?
Do â¢' we .; hold f them â¢; by > treaty : or : by : conquest ?

we i purchase i the * people? ' If < not,* how ; did we

Title to Land and People.
N The Republican platform promises that some
measure of self-government Is -to be given to
the Filipinos by law; -but,. even this pledge is
not fulfilled. 'Â¦ Nearly sixteen * months elapsed
after ' the . ratification of the treaty '.before the
adjournment of Congress last June, and yet
no law was passed dealing -with the Philippine
situation. ; The will of the President. has been

does the Republican party hesitate to legislate

bring Into the body politic eight or ten million
Asiatics, so different from us in race and his
tory that amalgamation is impossible? Are
they to share with us in making the laws and
shaping the destiny of this nation? No Re
publican of prominence has been bold enough
to advocate such a proposition. The McEnery
resolution, adopted by the Senate Immediately
after the ratlttcatlon of the treaty, expressly
negatives this idea. The Democratic platform
described the situation when It says that the
Filipinos cannot be citizens without endan
gering our civilization. Who will dispute it?
And what is the alternative? If the Filipino
is not to be a citizen, shall we make htm a
snbject? On that question the Democratic plat
form speaks -with emphasis. It declares that
the Filipino cannot be a subject without en
dangering our form of government. A repub
lic can have no subjects. A subject Is possi
ble only In a government resting upon force,
he Is unknown in a government deriving Its
Just powers from the consent of the, governed.
The Republican platform says that "the larg
est measure. of self-government consistent with
their Welfare and our duties shall be secured

strange doctrine for a government which owes
its very existence to the men who offered their
lives as a protest against government without
consent and taxation without representation.
In what respect does the position of ' the Re
publican party differ from the position taken
by the English Government In 1776? Did not
the English Government promise a good gov

promised a bad government to his people? Did
not . the : English Government promise that the
colonists should have the largest measure of
self-government consistent tfhth their welfare
and English duties? Did not the Spanish Gov
ernment promise to give to the Cubans the
largest measure of self-government consistent
with their â¢ welfare 'and- Spanish duties? The
whole difference - between a monarchy and a
republic may be summed up in one sentence.
In a. monarchy â¢ the King gives to the people
what he believes to be a good government; In

what they believe to be a good government. -

Treatment of Filipinos.
- The title of Spain being extinguished we
were at liberty to deal with the Filipinos ac
cording to American principles. The. Bacon
resolution, Introduced a month before hostili
ties broke out at Manila, promised Independ
ence to 'the 'Filipinca on the Fame terms . that
it was promised to . the Cubans. . I supported
this resolution and believe that its adoption
prior to the breaking out of hostilities would
have prevented bloodshed and thÂ«t its adop
tion at any subsequent time would have ended
hostilities.
If the treaty had been. rejected considerable
time would have necessarily elapsed before a"
new treaty could have been agreed upon and :
ratified, and during . that time the question !
would have been agitating the public mind.
If the Bacon resolution had been adopted by
the Senate and carried out by the President,
plther at- the time of the ratification of the
treaty or at any time afterward. It would
have taken thr nuestion of imperialism out
of politics ana left; the American people free
to deal with their domestic â¢ problems. But
the resolution was defeated by the. vote of
the Republican Vice President and from that
time to this a 1 " Republican Congress has re
fused to take any action whatever in the mat
ter. Â¦Â¦ Â¦- v â¢Â¦-".. - -." Â¦Â¦:-'Â¦ Â¦Â¦'Â¦
When hostilities broke out at Manila Repub
lican speakers and Republican editors at once
sought to lay the blame upon those who had
delayed the ratification Â¦Â¦ of ,the - treaty and
durlng'.the progress of the war the same Re
publicans have accused the opponents of Im
perialism of giving encouragement' to the Fili
pinos. This is a" cowardly evasion : of respon-
Bibility. Â¦Â¦._Â¦Â¦
If it is right for the United States to hold
the Philippine ' Islands permanently and Imi
tate the European empires 'in -the- government
of the colonies the Republican party ought to
Etate Its position and defend it, but It must
expect the : subject races to -protest against
such a policy and to resist to the ' extent : of
their ability. The Filipinos do not need any
encouragement from Americans now > living.
Our. whole history has. been an encouragement
not only to the Filipinos, : but \to all who are
denied a voice in their own government. If
the â¢ Republicans are - prepared . to censure all
who have used language calculated' to â¢ make
the Filipinos hate foreign. domination' let them
condemn the speech of. Patrick Henry. .When
he uttered that passionate appeal.. ."Give mo.
liberty or give me death,", he expressed a sen
timent which still echoes in, the hearts of men.'

Â¦which Involve the very structure of our gov
ernment the Republican leaders give new evi
dence of their abandonment of the earlier
ideals of the party ami of their complete sub-
Ftrviency to pecuniary considerations.
But they shall not oe permitted to evadÂ» the
ftupendous and far-reaching issue which they
hjcre deliberately brought into the arena of
jwlitics. When the President, â¢ supported by a
I>ractical!y unanimous vote of the House and
donate, entered upon a war with Spain for th*
jiurpcse of aiding the struggling patriots of
Tuba the country, without regard to -parly,
applauded. Although the Democrats recog
nized that the administration would necessarily
pain a political advantage from the conduct ot
a war which, in the very nature of the case,
must soon end in a complete victory, they
vied with the Republicans in the support which
they gave to the President. When the war
was over and the Republican leaders began to
FUBgeet the propriety of a â¢ colonial policy op-
I<opitlon at once manifested itself. When the
President tlnnlly laid before the Senate a treaty
which recognized the independence of Cuba but
provided for the cession of the Philippine Isl
ands to the United States the menace of im
perialism became so apparent that many pre
ferred to reject the treaty and risk the. ills
that might follow rather than take the chance
of correcting the errors of the treaty .by .th:>
Independent action of this country-, . â¢
Â¦X. was among the number of those who bJ-'
lleved it better to ratify the treaty, ana end
the war., release the volunteers. . remove the
excuse for war expenditures and then . give to
the. Filipinos the independence which might be
forced from Spain by a new treaty. In view
of the criticism- which my action aroused Mn
Rome quarters I. take this occasion to 'restate
the reasons given at that 'time. I -thought it
safer to trust the American people to give In
dependence to the Filipinos than to trust | tn;
accomplishment of that purpose to diplomacy
with an unfriendly nation. Lincoln embodied
an argument in the question when he anked,
"Can aliens make treaties easier than friends
can make laws?" I believe that we are now
in a better jKisitlon to wage a successful con
test against Imperialism than we would have
been had the treaty been rejected. With the
treaty ratified a clean-cut issue ; is presented
between a government by consent and a gov
ernment by force and imperialists must bear
the responsibility for all that happens until
the question is settled. If the, treaty had
been rejected the opponents of imperialism
would have been held responsible for any in
ternational complications .which might hava
arisen before the ratification of another treaty.
But whatever. differences of . opinion may have
existed as to the best method of opposlnp
the colonial policy there never .was any dif
ference as to the great of the
question and there is no difference now as
to the course to be pursued.
"Can we not govern colonies?" we are asked.
The question Is not what we can do. but what
we ought to do. Thl3 nation can do whatever
It desires to do, but it must accept responsibllty
for what its does. If the constitution
stands In the way the people can amend the
constitution. I repeat, the- nation can do what
ever it desires to do. but it cannot avoid the
natural and lesitlmate results of Its own con
duct. The young man upon reaching his ma
jority can do what he pleases. He can disre
gard the teachings of his parents; he can
trample upon all that he has been taught to
consider sacred, he can disobey the laws of the
State, the laws of society and the laws of God.
He can stamp failure upon his life and make
his very existence a curse to his fellow-men,
and he can bring his father and mother In sor
row to the grave; but he cannot annul the sen
tence, "the wages of sin Is death." And so
Â¦with this nation. It is of age and it can do
what it pleases: It can spurn the traditions of
the past; It can repudiate the principles upon
Republicans ask. "Shall we haul down tha
flag that floats over our dead in the Philip
pines?"
The same auestlon might have been asked
when the American flaÂ»c floated over Chapulte
pec and waved over the dead who fell there;
but the tourist who visits the City of Mexico
finds there a national cemetery, owned by the
United States and cared for by an American,
citizen. Our flag still floats over our dead, but
when the treaty with TJesico was signed
American authority withdrew to the Rio
Grande, and I venture the opinion that during
the last fifty years the people of Mexico havÂ«
made more progress under the stimulus of in
dependence and self-government than they
would have made under a carpet-bag govern
ment held in place by bayonets. The United
States and Mexico, friendly republics, are each
stronger and happier than they would have
been had the former been cursed and the latter
crushed by an Imperialistic policy, disguised as
"benevolent assimilation." â¢

INDIANAPOLIS. Aug. Sâ William J. â¢
Bryr.n and Arilat IZ. Stevenson were
to-<Say in this city officially notified
of thrir nomination by the Demo
crats, at the recent Kansas City con- |
rention. to the offices respectively of ;
President and Vice President of the I
I'nited States. The ceremony was made !
the occasion of a popular demonr-trailon. j
and. with all. the Democrats may be said .
to have begun their national campaign. '
The notification occurred in Military
Park, a beautifully shaded tract of ground
in the center of the city. The park con
tains probably thirty acres of ground,
ind it was well covered with people. In
the vicinity of the speaker's Ftand the
crowd was very dense. It - would be a I
ielicate undertaking to estimate the num- j
LÂ«?r of people contained in this vast j
throng, but there were certainly many
thousands of them.
Probably a majority of them were resi-
Ifiits of Indianapolis, but many were j
froaj other portions of Indiana, while j
alhers also came from distant States. 1
l'here was also a quite general gathering |
A the members of the Democratic Na
tional Committee, while, ot course, the I
members of the two committees appoint- j
L-d to rna!:e the official notification were j
<Â».i*o present. !
The ceremony was preceded by a par- i
ide through tne principal streets of tne j
:ity, wni<-n was participated In t>y visit
nj; ana local l>eÂ«nocraue ciubs. These
uucu as an escort to tne noting tion party
and the ravalcaae was an imposing one.
i Me meeting wgan a. lew minutes alter i
j ciocjt ana concluded at 5:4U. In thia i
t >enod ot nine, nve speeches â¢were maue.

Crush at the Stand.
The weather was hot. but toward the
ctose ot the ceremonies a slight breeze
alleviated to some extent the suffering oc
casioned by the high temperature. At one
time it appeared as if actual suffocation
might be me result of the terrible crowd
ing in front of the stand, where the cere
monies occurred, but beyond a few faint
ing attacks and much personal'dlscomfort
no evil resumed. The platform on which
the speeches were made was elevated
about six feet above the park lawn and
upon it sat the candidates and their fami
lies and the members of the National
Committee and of the two notification
committees, as well as a few invited
gu<'t=is. Mr. Bryan sat near the corner of
the Btage. just to the left of Chairman
Jones, who presided. Mrs. Bryan and their
Eon, William Jr.. occupying adjoining
chairs. Mr. and Mrs. Stevenson also sat :
in the same group, as did Mrs. Senator
Jones, Mrs. Richardson and Governor and
Mrs. Thomas.
The meeting was called to order In a
brief speech of welcome by Mayor Tag
part of this city, who was cordially and
familiarly greeted by the vast audience.
The Mayor introduced Senator Jones of
Arkansas as permanent chairman of the
mofjinp, the national chairman being
greeted by I*>ud cheers.
Senator Jones made no speech, but con
fined his remarks to the simple Introduc
tion of the speakers to the audience.
Mr. Richardson, to whose lot as perma
nent chairman of the national convention
fell the duty of notifying Mr. Bryan of
his nomination, made the first of the noti
fication addresses. He arose to look upon
a sea of up-turned faces. The sun wa*
throwing its rays directly upon many of
them. In this crowd, which was so denso
that a hand which was down could not
be raised, and one which was raised could
not be lowered, were old men. frail women
and small children. Soon the mass begau
to sway back and forth through the et
fnrts of those in the rear to get nearer
the speakers.
Richardson Interrupted.
There were a few screams, more groans,
and it became necessary to get some o'
the feebler people out of the crush. There
m-ere loud cries of "Cut it short"; "Give
Bryan a chance"; "We can't stand it
here." and other signs of Impatience.
For a time Mo Richardson did not ap
pear perturl>ed by this clamor, but when
there appeared to be real danger of seri
ous results he brought his remarks to a
somewhat precipitate close, speaking for
only about fifteen minutes. Notwithstand
ing the general confusion Mr. Richardson
was applauded in many places, especially.
eo when he referred to the "Sulu slavery
and Oriental harems" included in the
Philippine acquisition.
Congressman Richardson said in part: '
Mr. Bryan: On the one hundred and twenty
fourth anniversary of the birth of this re
public there assembled in Kansas City the
most Intensely American convention that ever
<a.::.f together in its history. This great body
was made up of men from every State and
Territory in the Union. They came from their
respective districts filled with unfeigned en
thusiasm for the inspiring cause which brought
them together. Their 7,000,0)0 of constituent*
had empowered them to frame a platform of
principle* and select candidates for President
and Vice President of the United States In
what they conceived to be the rupreroest po
litical crisis tbat ever came to our country.
These delegate* all realized that the republic
is In peril. They felt that the duty -was theirs
to take such action as would rescue tbe state
from the gulf of imperialism in which it had
been plunged and thus preserve for thera
felves and poeterity unimpaired the priceless
blessings of free government and civil liberty.
You see before you to-day a committee of
delegates from that convention and for whom
I epeaJc, upon which is represented each State
and Territory, whose duty it is to convey to
you in formal manner the notification that
the auiruFt assembly I have mentioned, acting
for- its members, their constituents, and for
all who love and cherish liberty everywhere,
with no dlssentlnc voice, chose you as the
candidate for President and adopted a plat
form of principles upon which the campaign
we are now inaugurating shall be conducted.
The declaration of party principles enunciated
.1 now have the honor to present to you.
Bryan Greeted. ]
There was an immediate change of de
r>ortm<v.t on the part of the crowd when
Mr. Bryan arose. He was introduced at
3:30 by Chairman Jones and,, as if or
<icred for the occasion, a light breezÂ«Â»
sprang up. which evidently had the effect
of bringing some relief to the overheated
a.nd much crowded mass of people, r At
any rate, afwr one burst of rapturous ap
plause, the crowd quieted down and re
mained well behaved throughout the de
livery of the ppeech. There were occa
pional cries of ''louder" when Mr. Bryan
jirst began to ppeak. but these wer* offset
by huzzahs fo'- the speaker. After a few
contests of this kind, the auditors made
no further signs except to applaud the
strong parts of the sp**ch as they were
made.
Mr. Brj'an read fcis speech, departing
not" from his manuscript, except in a
word of legislation at the beginning of
his address. He was sitting immediately
to the left of Senator Jones when he was
presented by that gentleman. He arose
promptly and v.-as immediately recognized
bv the ontire assemblage.
â¢ The Democratic leader never appeared
to better advantage. His face was slightly
flushed, but his eye was clear and calm
and his voice was never more completely
at his command. His manner wax calm
end cool and evidently heMt his full con
trol of tbe situation as he took J.ne one
Ftcp necessary to bring him to, the front
of the platform. He was dressed- in a
black sack coat, which was loosely but
toned at the waist. AÂ«white shirt front
was capped by aa white a necktie. These
gave the appearance of coolness in the
temperature and comported well with the
speaker's personal bearing. There was
no FUg-pestion of impediment of speech.
His clear voice was far-reaching and that
he was heard at a great distance was
made evident by the fact that people far
out in the- listened apparently as
intently as did those who sat on the plat
form. Apparently no strong point was
lost to any one present.
Strong Sentiments Cheered.
Among the sentiments of the speech
which were applauded with especial zest
were those declaring that under. existing
circumstances "we dare not educate the
Filipinos lest they learn to read the Dec
laration of Independence and the consti
tution of the United States," that he
would never agree to exchange the glory
of this country for that of all the empires;
that "it is not necessary to own a people
in order to trade with them." and the
"command. Go ye into all the world and
preach the gospel,' has no Gatllng gua at
tachment."
There was also general cheering over
the promise to convene Congress imnie-
diately to remedy the Philippine situation
if elected, but no part of th,e address re
ceived tne earnest commenoat-on that
was bestowed upon the peroration. This
called out an outburst that was both tu
multuous and prolonged.
Mr. Bryan spoke a few words extem
poraneously in introducing his speech, all
of which, except tht- peroration, was read
from manuscript. The closing sentences
were repeated from memory in a most ef
fective manner. The extemporaneous in.
troduction was as follows:
"I feel that I owe an apolojrv or expla
nation to the people who are to listen.for
the fact that 1 must read what 1 am go
ing to say. It would be more pieasant to
me and more agreeable to vou to speak
without notes, but I want to address that
larger constituency which we reach
through the newspapers, for it is a thou
sand times as numerous as any crowd
which could assemble here; and, there
fore, in order that I may speak to all
throughout the land, I have committed
to writing what I desire to say. and will
ask your indulg-enee while I read my
speech."
He then read his address as follows:
Speech of Acceptance.
Mr. Chairman and members of the No
tification Committee: I shall at an early
day, and in a more formal manner, ac
cept the nomination which you tender,
and I shall at that time discuss the va
rious questions covered by the Democratic
platform. It may not be out of place,
however, to submit a few observations at
this time upon the general character of
the contest before us and upon the ques
tion which is declared to be of paramount
Importance in this campaign. , .
When. I say that the contest of 1900 is
a contest between Democracy on the one
hand and plutocracy on the other, I do
not mean to say that all our opponents
have deliberately chosen to give-to organ
ized wealth a predominating influence in
the affairs of the Government, but I do
assert that on the important issues of the
day the Republican party is dominated by
those influences which constantly tend to
elevate pecuniary considerations and ig
nore human rights.
In 1S59 Lincoln said that the Repub
lican party believed in the man and the
dollar, but that in case of conflict it be
lieved in the man before the dollar. This
is the proper relation which should exist
between the two. Man, the handiwork of
God, comes first; money, the handiwork
of man, is of inferior Importance. Man iÂ»
the master; money the servant, but upon
all important questions to-day Repub
lican legislation tends to make money the
master and man the servant.
The maxim of Jefferson, "Equal rights
to all and special privileges to none," and
the doctrine of Lincoln that this should
be a government "of the people, by the
people and for the people" are being dis
regarded and the instrumentalities 01 gov
ernment are being used to advance the
interests of those who axe in a position
to secure favors from the Government. ;
The Democratic party is not making
war upon the honest acquisition or
wealth; it has no desire to discourage in
dustry, economy and thrift. On the con
trary, it gives to every citizen the great
est jwssibie stimulus to honest toil when
it promises him protection in the enjoy
ment of the proceeds of his labor. Prop
erty rights are most secure when human
rignts are respected. Democracy strives
lor a civilization in which every member
of society will share according to his
merits. . ..
No one has a right to expect from soci
ety more than a fair compensation for the
service which he renders to society. If he
secures more. It is at the expense of some
onÂ© else. It Is no injustice to him to pre
vent his doing injustice to another. To
him who would either through class leg
islation or in the absence . of necessary
legislation trespass upon the rights ol ! an
otner the Democratic party says "Thou
shalt not." *, ,
Against us are arrayed a comparatively
small but politically and financially pow
erful number who really profit by Repub
lican policies; but with them are associat
ed a large number who, because of their
attachment to the party name, are giving
their support to doctrines antagonistic to
the former teachings of their own party.
Republicans who vised to advocate bimet
allism now try to convince themselves that
the cold standard is good; Republicans
who were formerly attached to the green
back are now seeeking an excuse for giv
ing national banks control of the nation's
paper money; Republicans who used to
boast that the Republican party was.pay
ing off the national debt' are' now looking
for reasons to support a perpetual and in
creasing debt; Republicans. who formerly
abhorred a trust now beguile themselves
with the delusion, that there- are good
trusts and bad trusts, while in' their minds
the line betweeen the two is becoming
more and more obscure; Republicans who
In times past congratulated: the country
upcn the small expense of our standing
p.rmv are now.makinp light of the objec
tions ,which are urged against a large in
crease Jn.the permanent military estab
lishment;'Republicans who gloried in- our
Independence when .the nation was less
powerful now look with favor upon a.for
eign alliance; Republicans who three years
aco condemned "forcible annexation" as
immoral and even criminal nre now sure
that it is both immoral and. criminal = to
oppose forcible annexation. That; parti
sanship has already blinded many, to pres
ent dangers is certain; how large a por
tion of the Republican party -can be drawn
over to the new,' policies Â¦ remains to be
seen. '. -
Republican Inconsistencies.
For a time Republican leaders were in
clined to deny to 'opponents the right to
criticize the Philippine policy of the -ad-'
ministration, but upon, investigation they
found that both Lincoln and Clay assorted
end exercised the rlpht to criticize a Pres
ident during- the progress of the Mexican
war. *'' ; KT?.**Sfi"!j8SiSS

protection to all the foreign Ministers In Peking.
On repeated occasions the Tsung 11 Tamen

needs of the Government, and a return to the
policy of strict economy In all governmental ex
penditures. â¢ ' -..â¢â¢Â¦"'- â¢ ,
In apt-words the Dlngley tariff law Is con
demned. It is tersely characterized as legisla
tion skillfully devised ' in"., the ; interest ;Â¦Â¦ of i, a.
class, and to impose upon - the many - burdens
which they should not bear. Adhering to the
time honored doctrine of the Democratic party,"
we crsoÂ»e J all tariff legislation, \ the ; necessary
consequence of which Is at the expense of the
Lavish ' Appropriations.
It is wisely provided by the constitution that
at stated times political power shall return
to the hands of the people. The struggle for
political eupremacy upon which we I are now
entering Is one of deep moment to the Ameri
can people. Its supreme importance to all
conditions of our countrymen cannot be meas
ured by worda. The ills resulting from unjust
legislation and from unwise administration of
the government must find their remedy In the
all potent ballot. To ' it we now make our
solemn appeal.
The .chief purpose of the great convention
whose ! representatives are before me was re
dress for existing wrongs and security against
perils yet greater which menace popular gov
ernment. Your convention, in language clear
and unmistakable. has presented the vital
issues upon which the pending contest Is to
be determined. To Its platform I give my
tamest assent.
Clearly and unequivocally the Democratic
convention haÂ« expressed . its sympathy with
the burghers of the South African republics in
their heroic attempt to maintain free govern
ment. In this the convention not only voiced
the sentiments of American Democrats, but of
liberty-loving men everywhere. It Is not
strange that those who have kept .the political
faith of the author of the Declaration of In
dependence should express their abhorrence at
the effort of a great European power to sub
jugate a people whose only crime is a deatji
struggle to -maintain - their liberties. The
earnest utterances of the convention that our
sympathies are with the Boen In their un
equal struggle meet a hearty response from
all who venerate the principles of our fathers.
Is it not true that In all the past a belief In
the inalienable rights of all peoples has . been
with us a living faith? That our sympathy
has ever been with the, oppressed, , with those
who are struggling for a larger measure of
freedomâ for self-government? For this reason
our government was among the first to extend
recognition to the republics of France and Mex
ico, prompt to extend our sympathy as well as
official recognition to the little South American
States on their escape from the despotism of
Spain and upon their efforts to establish ; for
them>Â«elves representatlx-e. governments fash
ioned after our own. History has but repeated
Itself and the struggle to .maintain free gov
ernmentâa century and a'Hiuarter after the
promulgation of the Ueclaratlon of Independ
ence â haÂ« been trarnferred from the New World
to the Old.' Is It to be wondered then that the
political â¢ disciples of Jefferson , should express
their sympathy for the oppressed republics of
South Africa? . Only these who- believe that
our own country has outgrown, the doctrlne3
of the fathers are in sympathy with England's
attempt to establish monarchy upon the ruins
cf re-publics. - HBiSE
Deeply Impressed with a sense of the respon
sibility assumed by such candidacy I accept
the nomination so generously tendered me.
Should the action of the convention meet the
approval of the people In November It will be
my earnest endeavor to discharge with fidelity
the duties of the great office.
I ain profoundly grateful for the honor con
ferred upon m-i by my selection by the Na
tional Democratic Convention as its candidate
for the hlrh office of Vice President of the
United States. For the complimentary manner
In which such action has been officially made
known to me I express to you. Mr. Chairman,
and to your honored associates of the com
mittee my sincere thanks.
Stevenson's Address.
Mr. Bryan concluded at 4:40 and was
promptly followed by Governor C. S.
Thomas of Colorado, who notified Mr.
Stevenson. Mr. Thomas spoke for only
ten minutes, but he made a very effective
speech. He received very general atten
tion and was given frequent and generous
applause.
Mr. Stevenson was apparently slightly
nervous as the time approached for him
to take the stand, but he soon gained
confidence as he proceeded. Mr. Bryan
led the liberal applause which grreeted
the appearance of his fellow candidate
as he advanced to the front, and many
points of the speech were liberally
punctuated by a repetition of applause as
the speech proceeded. He read from
manuscript. His speech was as follows:
Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of the commit
tee: I can never fully discharge the debt of
gratitude which I owe to my countrymen for
the honors which they have so generously be
stowed upon me; but. sirs, whether it be my lot
to occupy the high office for which the con
vention has named me or to spend the re
mainder of my days In private life, it shall be
my constant ambition and my controlling pur
pose to aid in realizing the high ideals of those
whose wisdom and courage and sacrifices
brought this republic Into existence. I can
conceive of a national destiny surpassing the
glories of the present and the past â a destiny
which meets the responsibilities of to-day and
measures up to the responsibilities of the fu
ture. Behold a republic, resting securely upon
the foundation stones quarried ty revolutionary
patriots from the mountain of Eternal Truth â
a republic applying In practice and proclaiming
to the world the self-evident proposition: That
all men are created equal; that they are en
dowed with Inalienable rights; that govern
ments are instituted among men to secure those
rights; that governments derive I their Just
powers from the consent of the governed. Be
hold a republic in which civil and religious
liberty stimulate all to earnest endeavor and in
which the law restrains every hand uplifted for
a neighbor's injury^-a republic in which every
citizen Is a sovereign, but In which no one
cares to wear a crown. Behold a renubllc
standing erect while empires all around are
bowed beneath the weight of their own arma
mentsâa republic whose flag Is loved while
other flags are only feared. Behold a republic
Increasing In population, in wealth, in strength
and in Influence, solving the problems of civili
zation and hastening the coming of a uni
versal brotherhoodâ a republic which shakes
thrones and dissolves aristocracies by Its silent
â¢example and gives light and Inspiration to those
' who sit in darkness. Behold a republic grad
cally but eurely becoming the supreme moral
factor In the worM's progress and the accented
arbiter of the world's disputesâ a republic whose
history, like the path of the Just. "Is as tno
shining light that shlneth more and more Into
the perfect day."
Destiny is .the subterfuge of the Invertebrate
who, lacking the courage to oppose error, seeks
come plausible excuse for supporting It. Wash
ington said that the destiny of the republican
form of covernment was deeply. If not. finally,
staked on the experiment entrusted to the
American people. How different Washington's
definition of destiny from the Republican de
finition. The Republicans say that this nation
Is In the hands of destlnyi Washington be
lieved that not only the destiny of our own
nation, but the destiny of the republican form
of government throughout the world was en
trusted to American hands. Washington was
right. The destiny of this republic Is In the
hands of its own people; upon the success of
the experiment here rests the hope of hu
manity. No exterior force can disturb this
republic and no foreign Influence should be
permitted to change its course. What the
future has in store for this nation no one
has authority to declare, but each Individual
has his own idea of the nation's mission and
he owes It to his country as well as to himself
to contribute as best he may to the fulfillment
of that mission.
"Destiny" the Subterfuge.
Jt obliterates the distinction between right and
wrong and makes individuals of nations the
helpless victims of circumstances.
when our epponeats are unable to defend
their position by argument they fall back upon
the assertion that It Is destiny, and Insist that
we must submit to it. no matter how much It
violates moral precepts and our principles of
cuenuueot. Thl* Is a complacent philosophy.
There is an eajÂ«y, horjest, honorable notation
of the Philippine question. It Is set forth in
the Democrstic rlatform, and it is submitted
with confidence to the American people. This
r>!an I unreservedly indorse. If elected I shall
convene CorgTwss in extraordinary session as
roon cj I am Inaugurated and recommend an
immediate declaration of the nation's purpose;
flret. to ertabli6h a stable form of government
in the Philippine Islands, Just as we are now
establishing a rtable form of government In
Cuba: second, to Rive independence to the
Filipinos. Just as we have promised to give
Inoependence to the Cubans; third, to protect
th* Filipinos from outside Interference while
they work out their destiny. Just as we have
Jirotected the republics of Central and South
America, and are. by the Monroe doctrine.
ji!<-dKed to protect Cuba. An European pro
tectorate r.ften remits In the exploitation of
the ward by the guardian. An American pro
tectorate given to the nation protected the ad
vantage cf our strength, without making It
the victim or our greed. For three-quartem of
a ce-ntury the Monroe doctrine has bscn a
thield to nelghbor!r.K republic*, and yet is has
\mytmtA ro pecuniary burden upon us. After
the Filipino* ha<i aided us In the war against
to their former masters; we could not leave
them to be tho victims of the ambltloux de
signs of thÂ» European nations, and since we
<!o not <SÂ«>Â£lre to moke them a part of us or to
hold them as subjects, we propose the only
alternative, namely, to give them independence
ar.d guard them against molestation from
without.
The argument made by some that it was un
foTtui;ate for the nation that It had anything
to do with the Philippine Islands, but that the
navaJ victory at Manila made the permanent
acquisition of those Islands necessary, is also
unsound. We won a naval victory at San
tiago, but it did not compel us to hold Cuba.

lridr-jjendence. The fact that the American flag
floats over Manila does not compel us to ex
ercise perpetual sovereignty o\ - er the Islands;

President lias promised to haul It down when
the i.ap- of the Cuban republic is ready to rise

Love, not force, was the weapon of the
Nazsrene; sacrifice for others, not the ex
ploitation of them, was his method of reaching
the human heart. A missionary recently told
me that the stars and etripes once saved his
life, because his assailants recognized our flag
* s a flag that had no blood upon it. Let it
be known that our missionaries are seeking
eouls Instead of sovereignty ; let It be known
that instead of being the advance guard of
conquering artuiea they are going forth to help
end to uplift, having their loins girt about
â¢with truth and their feet shod with the pre
paration of the gospel of peace, wearing the
breastplate of righteousness and carrying the
fwerd of the spirit; let It be known that they
are the citizen* of a nation which respects the
rights of the citizens of other nations as care
lu'.ly as it protects the rights of its own citi
zens, and the welcome riven to our missionaries
Win be more cordial than the welcome extended
to the missionaries of any other nation.

It is noi strange, therefore, that the labor
organizations have been quick to note the ap
proach of these dangers and prompt to protest
against both militarism and imperialism.
The r,*eur.$ary argument, though more effect
ive with certain classes, is not likely to be
lisr-d so often cr presented with so much rm
jihasis as the religious argument. If what has
bet-n termed "gunpowder gospel" were urged
apair.st the Filipinos only it would be a suffi
cient answer to eay that a majority of the
Filipinos are now members of one branch ol
thÂ« Christian church, but the principle in
volved is or,e of much wider application and
challenges serious consideration.
The religious argument varies In positiveness
from a passive belief that Drovldence delivered
the Fillulnos Into our hands for their good
and our glory to the exultation of the-minit-ter
v ho said that we ought to "thrash the natives
(Filipinos) until they understand who we are,"
end "that every bullet sent, every cannon shot
tnd every flag waved means righteousness."
We cannot approve of this doctrine in one
place unless we are willing to apply It every
where. If there Is poison In the head It will
ultimately reach the heart. It is equally true
that forcible Christianity, if planted under the
American flag in the far-away Orient, will
sooner or later be transplanted upon American
eoiL If true Christianity consists In carrying
out in our daily lives the teachings of Christ,
who will say that we are oommajided to civilize
with dynamite and proselyte with the sword?
He who would declare the divine will must
prove his authority cither by holy writ or by
evidence of a special dispensation. The com
mand, "Go ye Into all the world and preach
the jrospel to every creature" has no Gatiing
jrun attachment. When Jesus visited a village
of Samaria and the people refused to receive
him some of the disciples suggested that fire
fhouid be called down from heaven to avenge
the Insult: but the master rebuked them and
said: "Ye know not what manner of spirit ye
ere of; for the son of man is not come to de-
Ftroy men's Urea, but to save them." Suppose
he had said. "We will thrash them until they
understand who we are," how different would
have been the history of Christianity. Com
r-are. if you will, the swaggering, bullying,
brutal doctrine of lmj>eriali*m with the Golden
Rule and the commandment "Thou ehalt love
thy neighbor as thyself."
In addition to the evils which he and the
farmer share in common, the laboring man
v.ill be the first to suffer If Oriental subjects
teek work in the Vnited States; the first to
puffer if American capital leaves our shores to
employ Oriental labor In the Philippine Islands
to eupply the trade of China and Japan; the
first to FuSfer from the violence which the mili
tary spirit arouses and the first to Buffer when
the methods of imperialism are applied to our
own Government.
Farmers and laborers have, as a rule, small
Incomes, and under systems which place the tax
upoa consumption pay more than their fair
ehare of the expenses of government. Thus the
very people who receive least benefit rrom im-
I>crlalism will t-e Injured most by the military
burdens which accompany It.
Imperialism would be profitable to the army
contractors, it would be profitable to the ship
owners who carry live soldiers to the Philip-
X>lnÂ«?s and bring dead soldiers back, it would be
profitable to those who would seize upon the
franchises and it would be profitable to the
officials whose salaries would be fixed here
and paid over there, but to the farmer, to the
laboring nun and to the vast majority of those
engaged in other occupations it would bring
<-xpend!ture without re-turn and risk without
reward.
Profits of Imperialism.
In* It by fleets and armies. I consider this war
Tn'.nst us, therefore, as both unjust and un
I place the philosophy of Franklin against
the Borild doctrine of those who would put a
I'rice upen the head of an American soldier and
Justify a. war of conquest upon the ground that
it will pay. The Democratic party is in favor
of the expansion of trade. It would <â¢ extend
our trade by every legitimate and peaceful
means, but It Is not willing to make merchan
dise of human blood. Uut a war of conquest
is ax unwise as It is unrighteous. A harbor
and coaling etation In the Philippines would
answer every trade and military necessity and
such a concession could have been secured at
fc.ny time without difficulty.
It is not necessary to own people in order to
trade with them. We carry on trade to-day
with every part of the world and our com
merce has expanded more rapidly than the
commerce of any Kuropean empire. We do not
twn Japan or China, but we trade with their
people. We have not absorbed the republics
of Central and South America, but we trade
with thtm. It has not been necessary to have
any political connections with Canada or the na
tions of Europe in order to trade with them.
Trade cannot be permanently profitable unless
it is voluntary. When trade Is secured by
force the cost of securing It and retaining it
must be taken out of the profits and the profits
are never large enough to cover the expense,
t^uch a eyetem would never be defended but
fcr the fact that the expanse Is borne by all the
people, while the pronts are enjoyed by the
lew.

Questions of Government.
Can It be that the new policy of forcible an
nexation of, distant Islands finds precedent In
the historic events I have mentioned ? The an
swer Is found In the bare statement of facts.
The territory acquired under Democratic ad
ministration is contiguousâ the Philippine
Islands eight thousand miles distant. The ac
quisition of territory upon our own continent
added little to the national expenseâ to main
tain permanent soverlgnty over the distant
Islands necessitates immense expenditures upon
our army and navy- ' More Â¦ than that. It con
templates methods of administration that per
tain not to the republic, but to the empire. Can
it be doubted that the attempt to stifle . the
spirit of- liberty abroad would imperil popular
government at home ?
The policy of aggressive expansion â of sub
jugation of distant Islands â pursued by : the
present administration finds no precedent in the
peaceful cession of . the Louisiana country by
Napoleon, that of Florida by Spain, nor that yet
later of the vast Western area by Mexico. The
territory : acquired under Democratic adminis
tration was, with favorable climatic conditions,
the fit abode for men of our own race., At the
time of annexation It passed under the rule of
the Anglo-Saxon, who carried with him our
language and our laws. It was territory con
tiguous to our own, and acquired j with the de
clared Intentionâ when the conditions and popu
lation would Justifyâ of carving It Into States.
Thfc result, millions of American homes, our
national wealth Increased beyond the Â¦ dream
of avarice, and the United States chief among
the nations of the earth.
. The Demoratlc party has ever been the ad
vocate of wise territorial expansion. It was In
control of the Government during forty years
of the . first" half of the present century.' . Dur
ing that period new ; States were admitted into
the Federal Union, and our western border ex
tended beyond the Mislssippl. . Out of the Louis
iana country â acquired under the first ' Demo
cratic administration â have been carved four
teen magnificent States. Under a later Demo
cratic administrationâ and as the result of the
treaty which terminated' our war with Mexicoâ
we acquired California and neighboring States
and Territories, thus bringing under our flag, to
remain forever, the vast expanse stretching to
the Pacific Ocean. â¢ - .
to our former allies In" their efforts to secure
their liberties. For the first 'time in our his
tory we are boldly confronted with the ques
tion of "imperialism â the spirit of the empire."
- This Is Indeed the supreme question to which
aJl others are of secondary importance. Before
we break irrevocably with the past and aban
don the doctrines of the fathers, it Is well that
we deliberate upon the consequences of a per
manent departure from the settled govern
mental policy of more than a century. The
success of the imperialistic policy . foreshadows
the empire. Shall the closing . hours of, the
century witness the American people abandon-
Ing the sure pathway In which past generations
have formed prosperity and happiness, and em
barking upon that of aggression and conquest,
acalnst which we are warned by the wrecks
that He along the entire pathway of history?
Standing out against the new policy of con
quest, with all that It Involves of European
complication, are the warnings of the founders
of the republic. Out of fashion as It may ap
pear, I quote the last words of Washington to
the oncoming generations of his- countrymen:
'"The great rule of conduct for us In regard. to
foreign nations is, in extending our commer
cial relations, to have with them as little
political connection as possible." It was the
author of the Declaration of Independence who
said: "Our first and fundamental maxim
should bo never to entangle 'ourselves In the
broils of Europe." Is It not well to ponder
these warnings before permanently embarking
upon nn untried- pathway beset with foreign
Jealousies, complications and antagonisms? .'
I Upon every phase of our foreign policy,- the
language Â¦ of the Democratic platform is too
clear to admit of. misconstruction. . It f favors
trade expansion - by all peaceful and .lawful
means. - ; We -â¢ believe = that Â¦ liberty. , as ; well Â¦â¢ as
the constitution, follows the flag. : Democrat*,
in common with' many. Republicans, oppose. the
Porto Rlcanlaw.as a, violation of the consti
tution and. a flagrant breach of ; good faith
toward a dependent people., It Imposes govern
ment without the consent of the i governed. Â¦ It
is In conflict with " that provision of the . con
stitution - which declares that v, "duties - im
ports and excises ehall be; uniform throughout
the United States."", Believing Â¦ that this : con
stitutional - provision . applies Â¦ to i every part I of
the United" States.: we condemn the . tariff tax
ution Imposed by ; a Republican Congress - upon
the helpless . and : distressed ; peopje Â« of : Â¦â¢. Porto
Rico. Such legislationâ Inspired solely by
greedâ Is Indeed the : harbinger of evil >to-the
republic. Â¦ The attempt to : collect unjust taxes
with, one hand, and, with: the other, to -return
them in part to a plundered people, , is i utterly
without constitutional warrant or Justification.
We ' cl ve I our earnest assent ' to the declaration :
"Our plain duty Is to abolish all custom tariffs
between, the United States and Porto Rico." and
give her products access do our markets.".^ No
party exigency or pressure 'Â¦ could : Justify \Â£i de
parture by the ' President , from the plain ipath
way of duty; he had here so Â¦ clearly . indicated."

of Â¦ Porto ' Rico Â¦ iÂ» a Â¦. palpable . violation s of the

Inspired by the great spirit of commercialismâ
has embroiled our Government in an,unneces
sary . war, sacrificed valuable lives f and ; placed
the American Â¦ republic . In deadly ~ antagonism
Foreign Policy.
A question . lÂ« yet to be discussed; to which
all of these are of secondary importance. >Â» It
Is solemnly Â¦> declared by Â¦Â¦ our platform to be
of paramount issue. Questions of .domestic
policy, however important, may be but ques
tions of the hour â that of imperialism Is for
time. In the presence of this stupendous issue
others seem as the dust In the balance. In
no sense paltering: with words, it Is the su
preme question, of republic "or empire, t The
words of the eminent Republican Senator.' Mr.
Hoar, challenge attention: "I believe that per-
Beverance in this- policy will be the abandon
ment of the principles upon which our Govern
ment is founded, that It will change our. Gov
ernment into an empire, that our methods of
legislation, of diplomacy, of ..- administration
must hereafter be those which belong to em
pires, and not these which belong to repub
lics." .
Needed Reforms.
At this hour I can but allude In brief words
to other needed reforms, to which the atten
tfon of the country is called by the Democratic
platform. Prominent among these Is such en
largement of. the scope of the interstate com
merce law as will protect the public from un
just transportation rates and individuals from
unfair discrimination. As Is well known, this
law has failed to effect the wise purpose for
which It was enacted. .In fact. It is now little
more than a dead letter upon the statute
books. Under well considered amendments, the
commission should be vested with ample power
to prevent Injustice both to individuals and to
the public. .
Our platform favors the creation of a de
partment of labor, whose chief officers shall
take rank with other constitutional advisers of
the President. This is in the interest of Justice,
and will prove an important step looking to the
proper recognition and encouragement of the
producers of wealth.
In explicit terms It favors liberal pensions
to our soldiers and Bailors and to those de
pendent upon them.
With equal Justice, It reiterates the demands
of a former Democratic platform for.bimetal
lism; the restoration of silver to its proper
function in our monetary system.'
For the protection of the home laborer It de
mands the enforcement of the Chinese exclusion
act. ' Â¦ Â»
And In the interest of an enlarged commerce
it favors the immediate construction . of the
Nicaraguan canal. Â¦ This, however, with the
provision that it shall remain forever under
the exclusive ownership and control of the
United States. The pending Hay-Pauncefote
treaty Is condemned as a surrender of Ameri
can rights, not to be tolerated by the Ameri
can people. In the construction and control
of this great work, there can be no concession
of right to any European power. Commercial
Interest. Â¦ and national â¢ safety in time of war,
nllke demand Its permanent ownership by our

beneficiaries colossal fortunes and largely In
creased to the people the cost of the necessa
ries of life. The baleful but logical result of
the tariff law, condemned by our platform. Is
seen in the sudden growth of giant monopolies,
combinations In restraint of lawful trade, and
"trusts" more threatening than foreign foe to
the existence of popular government. Believ
ing that "wherever there Is a wrong there
must be a remedy," the Democratic party will
favor such legislation as will curb the spirit of
monopoly, and place an effective barrier against
the unlawful combinations of capital which now
prove an Insuperable obstacle to legitimate en
terprise and Investment. The deadly power of
the trust Is felt In all channels of trade. This
Is but the beginning. It Is too much to say
that unless restrained by wholeBOtne laws, wise
ly and efficiently administered, the danger be
comes appalling? . Fostered by the .Dlngley
tariff law, the trusts during the present Re
publican administration have enormously In
creased In number and In power. A determined
effort for their suppression must now be made.
Delay would etill further endanger every law
ful business interest of the country. The im
perative necessity for a remedy being conceded,
the question arises: Into whose hands shall
be committed the work of formulating laws
looking to the suppression of trusts? To whom
Fhall be entrusted the execution of such laws?
Shall it be to the victims or to the beneficiaries
of the overshadowing evil? If to the latter,
then a further lease of power to the present
administration Is all that la needed. Can any
sane man believe that the trust evil is one that
will cure itself, - or that Its destruction will
be compassed by those to whom it has brought
princely fortunes? If so, let him point to a
single honest attempt of Republican officials to
enforce the law now upon our statute books
against the most stupendous commercial evil
known to any period of our history- The Dem
ocratic part^k stands pledged to â¢ an unceasing
warfare against private monopoly In . every
form. It demands the enforcement of existing
laws against trusts, and the enactment of laws
yet more stringent. It wisely demands public
ity as to the affairs of corporations engaged !;i
Interstate commerce. As 'one means to the Im
portant end of curtailing the power of trusts
we favor such amendments of our tariff laws
as will place the products of trusts upon the
free list and thereby prevent monopoly under
the plea of protection. During . almost four
years of absolute Republican control of all de
partments of the- Government, the trust evil
has grown to its present overshadowing pro
portions. What finger has been lifted for its
suppression? With Its friends again entrenched
In uower what hope Is held out for the fu
ture?
departure from all the traditions of the past;
from the high ideals of the founders Qf the
republic. It abrogates the holding of our
great court that the Declaration of Independ
ence is the spirit of the Governmentâ the con
stitution but its form and letter. Imperialism
knows nothing of limitations of power. Its rule
is outside the constitution. It means the es
tablishment by the American republic of the
colonial methods of European monarchies. It
means the right to hold alien peoples as sub
jects. It enthrones force as the controlling
agency in government. It means the empire.
As a necessary corollary to imperial-
Ism will come the Immense standing
army. The dread of militarism will be
fÂ«>lt in the New World, as it Is In the
Old. ,. The . strong arm of power will be
substituted for the peaceable agencies which
for more than a century have made our people
contented and happy. It was Jefferson who
said: "A well disciplined militiaâ our best re
liance In peace and for the first moments of
war." True at the beginning of the century
with a few millions of population, no less true
at the close, as we stand In the forefront of
the nations with a population of 80,000.000. The
result of our recent conflict with Spain gives
emphasis to the prophetic . words of Jefferson.
Existing conditions In continental Europeâen
tailing taxation and misery to the verge of
human endurances-illustrate by sad ' object
lessons the inevitable result of large standing
armies in time of peace. Shall we still give
heed to the warning of the great age of the
revolution or enter upen a. new century with
European monarchies as our. model? Without
a' large standing army, but relying upon the
patriotism and courage of American manhood,
we were victorious In the second war with
Great Britain, with Mexico, in the great civil
strife and with Spain. ,In the light of history,
can it . be Â¦ possible that the American people
will consent to the permanent establishment of
a large standing army, and Its consequent con
tinuing and ever Increasing burden of taxation?
We are told that our republic Is now to be
come "a world power" In the highest senseâ
with the Declaration of Independence as its
corner stoneâ It has been In all its past a
world power. It has been the lofty Ideal to
all "liberty loving people: the model for all
builders of republics for more than a century.
In the -sense used by imperialists the expres
sion Is one of terrible significance. It necessi
tates the methods and equipments of mon
archies. It means the creation and mainte
nance by our republic of standing armle<Â»
equal to those of the world powers of Europe.
At no less cost can be hold place as a world
power. Study existing conditions in European
nations and know what all this means to us.
It means taxation to the verge of despair. It
means, as has been truly said, "that every la
borer must carry an armed soldier upon his
back as he goes to his dally toll." All history
teaches that the corner stone of Imperialism
is the force of the standing army. :
We stand 100 years from the hour when the
political forces were gathering which were to
result In the election of the first Democratic
President. The anniversary election of the
masterful day in our history was wisely chosen
for the assembling in convention of the repre
sentatives of the historic party whose founder
was Jackson and whose platform Is the Dec
laration of Independence. In the great struggle
now upon us. we Invoke the co-operation of all
who revere the memory of our. fathers, and to
whom this Declaration Is not unmeaning parch
ment, but the enduring chart of our liberties.
Upon the supreme issue now In the . forefrontâ
and to the end that Republican government be
perpetuated â we appeal to the . sober judgment
.and patriotism of the American people.

There is comfort in the knowledge so
often expressed, that Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-
Roct, the great kidney remedy fulfills every
wish in curing rheumatism, pain in the
back, kidneys, liver, bladder and every part
of the urinary passage. It corrects inability
I to hold water and scalding pain in passing
, It, or bad effects following use of liquor,
wine or beer, and overcomes that unpleasant
necessity of being compelled to go often
during the day, and to get up many times
during the night. The mild and the extra-
ordinary effect of Swamp-Root fa soon
realized. It stands the highest for its won-
I derful cures of the most distressing cases.

BOY MURDERER
TELLS THE STORY
OF HIS CRIME
Fred Himes, Who Poisoned His
Father at Fresno, Testifies
aj the Inquest.
IT IS A REMARKABLE NARRATIVE
To-Day the Three LitUe Boys Impli
cated Will Be Formally Charged
With Murder.
W. M. Himes died at the County Hospi
tal at 2:30 o'clock this afternoon. Preced
ing his death the father .was visited by
his little daughter Bessie and an affecting
scene took place. ,Tne girl threw her arras
around the dying man's neck and kept
crying VPapa, papa" until the hospital at
tendants ledher away. Himes believed
until the last that he would recover.^MBH
A deputy sheriff communicated the news
to Fred Himes, ' the * youthful pa*ricide.
"It's pretty tough," said the youngster
without the least sign of emotion.
The. public prosecutor is satisfied that of
the boys Fred Himes at least is fully ac
countable for his crime under subdivision
1 of section 26 of the Penal Code., His
carefully laid plans and the - statements
made bv him snow that he clearly under
stood the wrongfulness of his act.- The
other boys will ; be prosecuted as any other
murderers would -be, and the matter- of
punishment will be left to the discretion
of the court. , ; v
Affecting Deathbed Scene.
The boy's only excuse for the crime was
that his father was mean to him and
drank a good deal.
"1 never thought. of killing him before,"
said he. "but when we lived at Santa
Cruz I often wondered how he did not
break his neck coming home full over the
grade. He never got bo full but what he
could eland up, though."
He was linaily asked if he had ever read
poison stories, and declared that he did
not care much for novels. He read school
books mostly. The last novel he read was
one called the "Bag of Diamonds." and
there was nothing aoout poison in it.
The inquest was conducted by Ueputy
District Attorney Church and only tnree
witnesses were examined. Two of these
were physicians, who testified as to^the
cause ot death. The third was Fred
Himes. who administered tne poison. The
boy's testimony agreed - in every detail
with the. statement made by him at the
time ol his arrest. His tact in answering
questions and his memory- of conversa
tions between himself and his accomplices
were marvelous. The three boys will be
formally charged with murder to-morrow.
â¢ The Coroner s inquest on the remains of
the dead man was concluded, at 10 o'clock
to-night.- The Jury brought, in -a verdict
of "dÂ«-ath from inflammation of the bowels
caused ; by arsenical poisoning, : the same
having been administered Ify. Fred Himes,
son of the deceased."
His Excuse for the Crime.
Fred Bald his father was the only, one
that drank coffee. â¢ On cross-examination
the lad testified that after his father haA
been eating a few minutes he got up and
went out, saying something was the mat
ter with his heart. Elmer Martin sus
pected that the poison- had made him
sick, but Fred said he did not think so.
They washed the dishes and went to bed,
Sleeping all night. He got up once and
gavÂ« his father a drink of water.
"I talked with Frankie about it
four or five days before I did it," was
the answer. "He agreed that it was
a good plan, so we just sat down and
figured it out. Father -was at -work.
He had whipped me that day."
The lad next explained how he, his
brother Frankie and his cousin Elmer
were going to do ranch work with the
horses and wagon. Klmer was to buy a
half interest in the outfit, paying $25 for
one of the horses and $40 for his share of
the wagron.
"Didn't you know you would have to
bury your father?" was asked.
"We didn't think about that," answered
the boy. "Of course, 1 knew he would
have to be buried, but I didn't say any
thing about It."
"When did you first think of kill
ing your father?"
Fred said his brother Frankie gave him
10 cents on Friday to help buy the poison.'
He was asked why he administered the
dose Saturday evening, and he said it
was because he knew his father would not
work on Sunday.
Flan a Division of Himes' Assets.
"Well, I told him I was going to
do it, and he said he thought it would
be a good plan. He asked me what I
was going to do with the horses and
wag-on. I told him I wanted to keep
the wagon. He asked me when I was
going to give father the poison, and
I told him that evening. Then we
went down town and bought the
'Rough on Rats' and waited."
After answering a few preliminary
questions Fred stated that his father was
taken sick about a quarter of an hoar
after he had begun to oat supper. Be
sides his father and himself, his two
brothers, Frankie and Ed, and his cousin,
Elmer, were present. He said he put the
poison In the coffee while it was cooking
about half an hour before supper. At
that time his father and younger brothers
were in the yard fixing the wagon. The
boy said he had told his cousin Elmer
about the plot that Â¦ morning. He . was
asked to relate the conversation he had
with Elmer.
The crowd craned their necks as the
13-year-old murderer walked briskly up
and took the oath, preparatory to telling
one of the most remarkable stories ever
related on a witness stand.
It was at the Coroner's Inquest that had
been summoned to sit in the case of \\\
M. Himes, who had died to-day, as the' re
sult of poison administered to him by one
of his sons, Frederick Himes; aided and
abetted by a younger brother and cousin.

Season's Event.
W BATTl,E, Wash.. Aug. 8.â Advices from Cape Nome to July 31 report
-that the â¢discoveries^.qf. rich pay dirt in the benches on Dexter and An-
J^^ vll creeks have stimulated prospectors to action. Reports of new
V^ strikes were coming in dally, and it is predicted that when the rainy
season permits work on other claims many creeks will pay as well as
Anvil and Dexter. It Is now assured that winter work can be extensively
carried* on.' ' â¢ '
Between Nikkila Gulch on the Anvil side and Grouse Creek on the Dexter
side fifty shafts are being sunk, and "many 50-cent pans have been taken
-out. The Loring bench claim is extremely rich and as high as JllOO.has
been rocked out in one day. Sixty thousand dollars was refused for this
claim. Other claims on Anvil and Dexter are promising. Bedrock. Is struck 1
at a depth of about forty feet, the ground being frozen -for about nine feet.
On Erlckson bench as high as $150 to the pan has been 'uncovered. On a.
bench at the head of Grouse Creek five feet of pay dirt has been struck at a
depth of fifty-tv.-o feet. It averages 10 cents and 15' cents to the pan. This
bench will be extensively worked this, winter.. u . â¢Â¦
These unexpected deposits of gold on the benches are accounted for by
the theory that an. old river bed runs along the .water shed now, separating
the Nome and Snake rivers. This whole section is being thoroughly pros
pected. . . ; . â¢ .--. -Â¦* , ' Â¦
There is much talk of railroad operations at Nome. At Â¦ present but one
line is running-a five-mile narrow gaugeâ from tidewater to Discovery, claim , :
on Anvil Creek, being operated by Si G. Simpson and C. D. Lane. A 1 lne 1Â»
now projected from Port Clarence to Golovin Bay, to tap the rich ; inland
country back of Nome. . ... *. . \ 'Â¦
Jafet Lindberg. known in Nome as. the '.'LuckyjSwede. has sent -a. pros
pecting party to Norton Sound. Their exact destination is secret, but Lind
berg says the new claims will prove very rich. â¢ â¢ 'â¢',"â¢. /-wM ._

expressed than earlier in the season. A cut rate on second-class steamer,

'A' new cottage is to be .erected at Ag
news Asylum and several more have be^n
planned." When bids for bricks were In
vited local dealers wanted between JS and
19 per 1000 for their brick. The managers
thought the price exorbitant and Manager
Hale. was appointed a committee to see if
brick could not be obtained from the yard
at the Napa Institution. 1 At the meeting
to-day he reported ~hat General Superin
tendent F.-W. Hatch had notified him that
Napa Asylum would furnish the, brick
needed for. $3 SO per. 1000 on board the cars
at that place. The railroad rate from there
here Is t1 per 1000,' making a total cost pÂ«jr
1000 of $6 SO. This is $2 23 per 1000 less than
the figures submitted by the Brickmakers'
Association and Agnewj Asylum will save
nearly $1000 on the one cattage alone. The
work of brickmaking at â¢ Napa is mostly
done by patients and the profit to the
asylum, at the figures quoted, is 40 cents
per 1000.
Local dealers do not take kindly to the
use of the asylum product in competition
and influence will be uaf>d to check It. i

The Tatoosh is on her maiden voyage,
and is as neat, compact and efficient a
tug as ever came Into San Francisco. She
is 128 feet long, 25 feet beam. 15 feet 6
inches deep ana can steam 14 knots. She
is to leave here Friday morning with the
ship John Ena In tow, for Port Gamble.
caslon after that when they could be re
set. This fact may cause the seizure of
the Rescue and Tatoosh. The United
States navigation laws \ state distinctly
that everything being towed must carry
a signal light at night. Not one raft that
has ever come into San Francisco has car
ried a light except for a few hours during
the first night. The shipowners now in
tend testing this question in the case of
the present raft, and If a complaint is
lodged with the Inspectors of Hulls and
Boilers the Rescue and Tatoosh will bo
eeized by the Government.
The Mail steamer City of Para arrived
from Panama and way ports â¢ yesterday.'
She- brought Â¦ up twenty-nve cabin and
thirty-one steerage : passengers. '
The steamer Belgian King, that was In
collision with the Tellus, Is In commission

"Water Front Notes.
"When the Russian ship City of Benares
arrived here last week nearly all her
crew deserted. A few days later seven of
them were taken by the boarding masters
and put aboard the British ship Thalatta.
They accepted the job, thinking they were
going on a coasting trip.- When- they
found -out that it was a, voyage to the
port they had Just come from (Liverpool)
three of them jumped overboard. Two of
them were recaptured, but the third, after
being an hour In the .water, was picked
up by Dave Crowley, the boatman, and
escaped. , < â¢

ship's name branded on his hide. After
that the shark was dumped over, the side
again. An hour later the same shark,
with the shlp's-name plainly visible, was
swimming astern and smelling at a piece
of pork attached to the hook.
Â£-ip i HE big log raft that has been a men-
I ace to coast navigation for several
jl days Is now on the Berkeley mud
flats. It was towed into Mission Bay
during Tuesday night, and yesterday
morning was towed over to the Oakland
side, where it will be broken up.
The tugs Rescue and Tatoosh towing
tandem brought the monster mass of piles
into port, losing about one thousand ot
the sticks on the way. Soon after g'etting
out of the Columbia River a very heavy
gale came up and for thirty-six hours the
towboats lay in the trough of the sea.
Any attempt to move on â¢with the raft
meant the loss of a number of piles, so
Captains Thompson and Bailey had to
endure the experience as best they could.
"When the storm was at Its height the
tugs g-ot to leeward of the immense lum
ber pile and in this way it was made a
little more comfortable for those aboard.
The plies escaping from tfie raft caused
some uneasiness, but luckily no damage
was done. "*^V

GEORGETOWN. Ky.. Aug. 8.â The de
fense In the trial of Caleb Powers Intro
duced a star witness this afternoon In B.
B. Coolman of New Albany, Ind., a civil
engineer who has worked for leading rail
roads of the country from New York to
Oregon. He testified that he had made a
Eurvey of the capltol grounds in Frank
fort, and had made a drawing, which he
presented. He explained various dlstaxtoee
In the grounds, and stated that a shot
;:red from the sill of the window of the
Secretary of State's office to the hole In
the hackberry tree would drop 13-lGths
of an Inch per foot In its passag-e.
He understood that the bullet in pass-
Ing through Governor Goebel's body
dropped 1 7-16 inches, and at this- rate it
would have dropped after leaving the
body eo as to strike the basin of the foun
tain, instead of the hackberry tree. A
bullet fired from the sill of the Secretary
of State's office window, which dropped
7-16 inches to the foot, would never have
reached the spot Â¦where Goebel Â¦was sup
posed to be standing. He stated further
that a line drawn through Goebel's body
from the point of exit to the point of
entrance and continued to the executive
building: in a straight line would have
ptruck It Shi feet, above the sill of the
window referred to.

ACTIVE PREPARATIONS
FOR* WATER INSPECTION
Expedition Being Fitted Out to Sur
vey Lake Tahoe System for Mu
nicipal Ownership.
Active preparations were begun Tues
day in the office of the Board of Public
Works for an expedition In the Sierra
Mountains for the purpose of investigat
ing Lake Tahoe and its tributaries. The
expedition will be under the direction of
Luther Waggoner, chief of the Depart
ment of Public Utilities. In his party he
will have a transitman, a leveler, two rod
men, an axman and a cook.
The 'start on the Journey will be com
menced in about two weeks, the point of
destination being the base of Mount Lin
coln, where the American and Truckee
rivers and the south fork of the Yuba
River have their rise. A complete survey
of the line and route of the canal neces
sary to bring the water to this city will
be made. The most desirable route will
be picked out and the required depth of
the flume will be ascertained. Figures
â¢will be given on the actual cost of con
struction of the piping. The Von Schmidt
dam will be a subject for special investi
gation. The preliminary surveys will
take at least one month, as comprehen
sive data will be gathered with a view to
determining, the best system for municipal
ownership. The party will make the trip
with pack animals, which may be bought
outright for the purpose at Summit Soda
Springs.
PHILIPPINE TARIFF
WILL BE REVIEWED
War. Department Answers Letter
Sent by San Francisco
Manufacturers.
Customs regulations recently, promul
gated at Manila, to the operation of which
San Francisco manufacturers and mer
chants objected, will be investigated by
the board of officers having in charge the
revfslon of the tariff. Colonel Clarence R.
Edwards, acting assistant adjutant gen
eral of the United States, has written to
Calm, Nlckelsburg" & Co., Â¦who Â¦wrote to
the War Department in behalf of them
selves and others, that the Military Gov
ernor at Manila has been requested to call
for a report i from the Collector of Cus
toms concerning the regulations, and this
re-port will be made known to manufac
turers and merchants as soon as possible.
The department was seemingly unable
to answer a question that has puzzled the
shoe manufacturers concerning the term
"23 Spanish," Indicating, the- minimum
size of men's shoes in Manila, and that is
still as much of a mystery as ever. The
objectionable regulations inflicted penal
ties for failure to Invoice the weights of
goods and of interior packings and exte
rior packings separately.
At. the meeting of the parade committee
last night by a majority of one the ques
tion of placing. the local parlors in line in

cort to the whole division of Native Sons,

Fresno to the effect that all San Joaquln
Valley parlors be assigned to one division.
The parlors eligible to such a division rep
resent Stockton, Fresno, Merced, Madera,

Â¦ The executive council of finance was ad-
Vised yesterday of numerous additions to
the celebration fund. Many sub-commit
tees were busy soliciting Â¦ and for that
reason did not report. The printing in
dustry subscribed $650 In two hours. The

Mr. Mathlas Leif. secretary Uniform
Rank Catholic Knights of America, writes
from 3327 North Clark street, Chicago, 111.,
as. follows:
The expense, as well as the Impossibil-
ity of leaving one's business, makes it
entirely out of the question for many peo-
ple to take a vacation, however bad they
may need It. In all cases where one can
afford it a vacation is probably prefera-
blÂ© % to tonics; but for the tens of. thou-
sands who can take no rest, the brain and
nerve tonic of modern medical science Is
an Indispensable safeguard.
Nothing that Is. known to the medical
profession to-day is the equal of Peruna
In the cure or prevention of all derange-
ments due to hot weather. Peruna gives
new vigor to the tired brain, strength and
quiet to the weakened nerves, and as
nearly supplies the need of a vacation to
the overworked man or woman as it Is
possible for any remedy to do. Peruna
is a reliable specific lor nervous prostra-
tion, nerve exhaustion, sleeplessness and
chronic malaria.
Captain Percy "W. Moss, Paragould,
Ark., says: "I think Peruna is undoubt-
edly the finest and surest catarrh cure
ever prepared, end it has taken buÂ» two
bottles to convince me of this fact.".
O. W. Grier, Watsontown, Pa., says:
"Peruna has done what four doctors
could not do. My bowels are now all
right and I recommend, Peruna to
everybody who has bowel trouble. It
is our family medicine. I think I
would have been in my grave to-day
had it not been tor you."
The Peruna Medicine Company of Co-,
lumbus, Ohio, publish a book entitled
"Summer Catarrh." which Is devoted to
the treatment of Indigestion, diarrhoea. ]

CNE ON CARL SChJURZ
AMONG the critics of President McKinley none j
have been more bitter or more unfair than
Cafl Schurz. He has permitted himself an
almost unlimited largeness of statement in his de
nunciations of the administration, and has been so
unjust there will be no little amusement in learning
that he has been hoist at last by one of his own pe
tards.
Some time ago Mr. Schurz challenged the support
ers of the administration to furnish an instance of an j
?ct of perfidy committed by any republic more in- :
famous than President McKinley's treatment of the
Filipinos. The challenge went unheeded, for the sup
porters of the administration, and indeed the Ameri
can people generally, do not concede that our "Govern
ment has committed perfidy or infamy in any degree
whatever either in the Philippines or elsewhere. Still
the Washington correspondent of the Boston Journal*
thought it worth while to recall Mr. Schurz to his I
senses, and bj* way of doing so has republished what
Was said of the removal of the Ponca Indians from
their homes in South Dakota, an act committed by
Mr. Schurr himself -v.-hile Secretary of the; Interior,
It appears the affair gave rise at the time to no little
indignation among the friends of. the' Indians)' and Mr.
Schurz was denounced as roundly as hejs now de
nouncing others. The. removal, was characterized by j
John D. Long, then Governor of -Massachusetts; 1 as
forming "a flagrant dishonor," and the Senate Com- !
mittee on Indian^ Affairs, of which Henry L. . Dawes i
was chairman, . reported, after investigation, that "we !
can find no language sufficiently strong in which to
condemn the whole proceeding."
In the days when such fierce epithets were being,
hurled at him from the floor of the Senate and from
the country. at large-Mr. Schurz doubtless consoled
himself by the thought that epithets prove nothing,*
and it would be well for him to remember, the same
truth now.

States District Attorney for Alaska and
president of the Alaska Bar Association,

I should be the happiest woman on earth.
But there are bills to be paidâ doctor's

Mrs. "Paxton has a beautiful voice, mez

As we have insisted, no government is responsible
for these things. The people of the United States
chose to deliberately deceive themselves about the in
dustrial and ph3-sical conditions of the islands. Pro
ceeding without information or in spite of it, they
chose to look upon the acquisition of the Philippines
as securing a territory to which Americans could re
sort for permanent homes as they did to our conti
nental area between the two oceans. This they could
not do if every native were our friend and standing
at the beach to welcome us with music and flowers.
When this self-deception" is exposed by experience
the truth of The Call's frequent warnings will appear,
and the Government will be speedily disembarrassed
of every policy founded upon popular misapprehen
sion.
It is not a political but a physical issue. We can
not chanpe the climate. We cannot by resolution
change a vertical into a slanting sunshine. The rays
will continue to be focused and not distributed, and
the climate that is poison to us will prevail against
armies and everything else.
THE frequent warnings of The Call about the in
dustrial conditions in the Philippines, and our
conclusions that wherever military vigilance is
relaxed or altogether withdrawn there will be no
safety for Americans, are verified from a source that
every investor must respect The Associated Press
reports the findings of a half dozen agents of Ameri
can investors who are in the islands and have investi
gated the conditions there.
Their reports contain no encouragement They
find no safety outside vhe garrison towns. To get
good title to land is at present impossible. The
enly openings there are in the beer and liquor lines,
and such others as depend on army trade.
The mining experts report nothing in sight that is
worthy of consideration, and that far superior invest
ments in that line are plentiful at home, where there
is security for life and property. â¢ ,
All found it impossible to go outside of a town un
less guarded by soldiers. They were surprised at the
difference between actual conditions and the reports
of pacification of the people. As far as the opportu
nities of agricultural home-seekers are concerned,
they are found to be a myth. American labor cannot
exist there, not only on account of the ill feeling of
the people against us and the already dense state of
the population, but because of the climate, which is
poison to our race. <
PHILIPPINE INVESTMENTS.
The voters of this country are not such fools as to
turn their attention from, the great issue of maintain
ing good government, financial honesty arid prosper
ity at home, for the sake of following a demagogue
who goes about-denouncing as imperialism an issue
arising out of; a treaty which he himself advocated,
arid concerning which he -is not statesman enough to
formulate a policy, much less , carry it, were that duty
intrusted to him. \ '- â¢

The Board of Education was brought up
with : a round turn yesterday morning by
Superintendent .Webster when it endeav
ored I to carry i out its persistent policy of
leglsjating, teachers out of their positions.
The "cooked-up" resolution which precipi
tated Ayebster's opposition .was ; defeated.'
It provided , that George Bates be â¢ placed
on' the u'nassigned high school list ,*. as j the
number of teachers was greater than the
nutnber 'of- pupils; warranted. 'Â¦Â¦-, ; ' â¢- ', â¢"
Â¦;â¢, "1 desire to know," said Webster, '.'the
name of /the teacher who will . perform
the duties^ hitherto carried out by Mr.
Bates." T â¢ Â¦,,. â¢ -â¢-"-Â«
Chairman Mark replied that Mr. Gal
lagher had been assigned to the position.
"I cannot /understand." retorted Web
ster, "why this severe discrimination [ has
been made." There is nothing. to my knowl^
edge against ' A Mr. Â¦ Bates', record ; he .has
had a longer experience in the department
than Mr.; Gallagher, , and I think it is an
injustice ; to f single ; him â¢ out " for j dismissal,
which is practically the sense of the reso
lution."
Webster's severe- castlgation evidently
changed the programme to carry the reso
lution, for when it came to a vote
6erly .was excused from voting for rea
sons which he said he had explained pri
vately to Chairman Mark. Denman ana
Kincaid voted aye and Mark stated that
a necessity . might .arise ; for. Mr. Bates
services and he would . vote against the
resolution, which therefore was lost. He
Bald he would entertain a motion employ
ing Bates tor two-nfths of the time, but
none was forthcoming, so Bates will be
retained in his place. ,. t ...
Annie A. -Hill, a teacher of thirty years
service in the department, and Miss Mora
G. Sullivan filed their resignations, with a.
request that they, be placed on the retired
list, and it was so ordered. .
Or. the representation of the Sunnysiae
District Improvement Club, supplemented
by the report of Superintendent Webster,
that. the school in that section was in a
congested condition, the board will visit
theschool and provide a remedy if found
necessary. AV'ebster recommended that a
new four-room' schoolhouse to cost ?2aw
be built in the district.
vlA": petition signed by 450 taxpayers re
questing the establishment of a nigrn
school class in one of the evening schools
between Golden Gate' avenue and the
beach was taken under advisement.
â¢ ' A resolution was adopted providing for
the establishment of a bookkeeping class
and a commercial arithmetic class In the
Washington Evening School. .
Superintendent Webster, submitted his
financial report for the year ending June
SO, 1900, showing that there. had been re
ceived from all sources the sum of.*1.30l,
513 18 and that the expenditures had l>een
$1,285,098 61. : There is now to the credit of
the fund ' received from collateral inheri
tance taxes the sum of $3729 93.
The Stanford School was formally abol

The following transfers of teachers to

WEBSTER SAVES
ONE PEDAGOGUE
FROM DISCHARGE
@foe --t^SB^y'.JIfeUr
It will be seen that ' the election ; ; is likely [ to be a
most important one in many respects. Jt will iloubt
less result in a victory for Salisbury, which will enable
him to retain' office long enough to finish the war in
South Africa and direct British action in the present
crisis in China, but not longer. Democracy and so
cialism in Great Britain are advancing in power, and
the jingo spirit of khaki campaigns . cannot always
hold them back.
tain that in some constituencies at least home ' ques :
tions are going to be paramount' to those" of the em
pire. There has long; beenjan agitation for a redis
tribution of parliamentary seats;, as, the present ar
rangement is unfair to many of the more populous
centers. In a recent ?" speech'* upon the .. subj ectÂ» Lord
James of - Hereford Â¦ stated that the question" is ; a very
serious one, inasmuch as a redistribution which would
deprive the small boroughs and interests of their pres
ent representation in Parliament "would effect greater
changes than the reform^bills of 1832 or 1867." Some
of < the differences in the number of ; voters in various
constituencies are glaring. In . many^cases boroughs
and county districts having less than 3000 voters have
in Parliament a representation equal to that of. other
constituencies containing five times that number.
These inequalities were intentionally devised with the
object of giving representation to all classes and in
terests of the United Kingdom irrespective of popu
lation, and to overthrow them will bVa long step in
the direction of establishing a pure democracy.
Another factor that is likely to' have" a large effect
upon the election is the determination of the various
labor organizations to form a party of their own. In
an article in the current number of the Forum on
"Labor arid Politics in Great Britain." J. Keir Har
die, one of the ablest leaders of the workingmen,
says that between forty and fifty candidates will ; go
to the polls under the auspices of the -United Labor
party. Such action on the part of the workingmen
will of course weaken the Liberals, and it is quite pos
sible that old historic organization may go out of ex
istence, leaving the^ field free^ for the struggle between
the conservatism represented by the Tories and so
cialism advocated by the labor organizations. .
SINGS IN PUBLIC
FOR HER CHILDREN
Mrs. Bessie Blitz Paxton to
Appear on the Orpheum
al /?? RS. BESSIE BLITZ PAXTON,
//\/\ ex-wife of Blitz Paxton, , prexl-
II Jk \ dent of the Santa Rosa Bank, is
to appear on Sunday, night at the
Orpheumâ the lady's Initial appearance on
the stage of this city.
Mrs. ; Paxton made her professional de
but two weeks ago at the Orpheum In Ix>3
Angeles, and her triumph was .Immense
and Immediate. Grim necessity has driven
Mrs. Paxton from the drawing- room to
the theater. â¢ Â¦ ;
"I went on the stage to earn money for
my children," she said yesterday, discuss-
by the court itself. On this commission the best of ;
judicial talent has always been secured, and its assist- â¢<
ance has been of great value to the bench and of gre,at <
importance to litigants. Its creation involved no j
change in the deposit of authority over the legal rights t
of litigants, and raised no new questions to increase .
the litigation or augment the congestion which the
commission was devised to relieve. 1
Changing all this, the last Legislature proposed ]
an amendment to the constitution, creating three ap- ;
pellate districts in the State and furnishing each with
a separate appellate bench, consisting of three mem
bers. This appellate court of nine Justices is intended
to intervene between the supreme bench and the j
courts of first instance. It is to be furnished with an
elaborate machinery of bailiffs, reporters, stenog
raphers, etc, and its members are to be paid $6000
annual salary.
The amendment also proceeds to limit the jurisdic
tion of the Supreme Court, confining it to certain 1 is
sues only. 1
We have closely examined the existing situation in
the courts and the effect of the amendment, . if
adopted, and conclude that it does not amend, does
not make better, our judicial system.
It adds largely ta the cost for which the taxpayers
must provide, and does not return to them an equiva
lent economy. Instead of decreasing it will at once
increase litigation, since it raises a vast mass of liti
gable issues by the changes implied in the deposit of
judicial remedy.
There are, at the outset, doubts of the legality of its
submission in the absence of an express statute pro
viding therefor. If adopted, all appealable litigation
will stand still until this doubt has been judicially
solved. Then will arise the cloud of issues involved
in the judicial change affecting judicable rights.
Some of the older States have these intermediate
appellate benches, as has our Federal system. But
the States in which they exist are far older, than Cali
fornia, with a volume of litigation much in excess
ours, and with a taxpaying capacity far more able to*
support them. Â¦
New York has such a court, but her population is
six millions, while"California has only one million and
a quarter. . ;
i Â¦ It seems fantastic to say that we require the same
costly and ponderous judicial machinery that is found
necessary in New York. .
Our courts are costly. The judicial buildings in
every county are provided by the taxpayers, and
constitute a vast outlay of public money. The sala
ries of Judges and court officers are a heavy charge
upon the public treasury.
The proper tendency- of the public mind is toward
the economy and simplicity of government, not to
extravagance and complexity. This is shown in the
movement originated in the State Teachers' Associa
tion to apply economy and simplicity to the adminis
tration of our â¢ school system. The cost of that ad
ministration .having become formidable and its com
plexities being on the increase, a commission of
teachers and those interested in education is at work
to increase the efficiency of the schools, not by pro-,
. viding more elaborate and costly machinery, but by'
doing away with existing complexities and their cost.
As this originated with the teachers themselves, the
' legal profession may well be admonished by it ; and
' conform its action to the public tendency.
Thus far it must, in fairness be said for Governor
Gage's administration that it has been characterized
by commendable economy. This is conceded by, those
1 who have felt justly aroused to criticism in other re
! spects. But the party which elected him must bear. the
blame of any departure from-that, policy, whether.the.
' executive is directly responsible or not, and we are
convinced that it will feel severely the consequences of
this bad amendment., which will increase the cost and
difficulties' of the judicial situation.

f~\ are amended to cure some defect tliat has ap
* peared in- their practical operation. ..Constitu
tions are amended, to add tp their- excellence, to in
crease their protection to the rights oft person V and
property, and to further economize or rationalize the
system of government which they provide. Unless
amendments serve one or. the other, or all, -of these
purposes'and objects, they are; not; in ,the; true and
proper sense amendments- at all, since they effect no
betterment in the instrument of .which they become a
part. Mainly through infirmity in " procedure, Uhe
courts of the State complain of undue pressure " of
litigation. The chase for a judicial finality is a stern
chase, and therefore a long one.' Through the for
malities*of procedure in the courts of first instance a
habit has arisen of taking matters to the Supreme
Court, with a view of securing some sorr of estoppel
upon the intermediate courts. The Supreme Court
has come to be used as a pruner of procedure in the
courts below, not by the regular processes of appeal,
but by cuts across lots. This has tended to congest
the docket of the Supreme Court, and to unduly delay
its decisions, in major cases, which involve the
greater principles of the law. To relievo this conges
tion the court has been furnished with the assistance
of a commission, the members of which are appointed

The Quartermaster general of the United
States army in his telegram of a few
days ago regarding the organization of
mule wagon teams Instructed the quar
termaster at the Presidio to employ a
sufficient number of packers at 550 per
month. Packers heretofore have been
paid 160. Experienced packers In this city
refused the lower rate of wages and the
department was so informed. The next
telegram was to the effect that If men
could not be secured in San Francisco for '
$50 a month packers would be forwarded I
from the East.
A number of teamsters are also wanted,
but men experienced in the handling of
army mule teams are not to be had for
130 a month, $10 less than paid heretofore.
The horses of the Third Cavalry wera
yesterday released from 1 quarantine, the

THURSDAY ...AUGUST 9, 1900
. JOHN D. SPRECKELS, Proprietor.
man:
Â¦ /T* HARLES A. FAULKNER of West Virginia,
( on' arriving in this city, announced that the
/ chief issuer of the campaign is to be that; of
imperialism. As he was at one time a UnitechStates
Senator and one of the .most eminent Democrats of
that body, his words may be taken as an expression
of the sentiment of the higher Democratic councils.
Like so. many other distinguished Southerners, he
feels a desire to get rid of , as much of Bryanism as
possible, and recognizes that the renomination of the
free silver champion of 1806 renders it necessary; to
the party to get a new issue by way of counteracting
the. hoodoo.
The wish is ever father of the thought, and
hence the distinguished West Virginian is doubt
less quite sincere in thinking that in the coming elec
tion the people will dismiss "all thought of Bryan's
financial, schemes and look upon^ him solely as a de
fender of the constitution against the ambitions of
aggressive imperialists. In â¢ fact, Bryan himself will
do what he can to further the scheme^ and in accept
ing his nomination has talked as if imperialism were
the sole issue of the campaign.' '
Up to this time there Has been nothing in the trend
of events or the development of public sentiment to
justify the hopes of these Democratic yearners after
a new issue, j In the first place no one has â¢ any fear
of the establishment of "imperialism'-' by, the Republi
can party. All that has been ; accomplished f or : free
dom and for the Union and the \ constitution ;- in .the
last fifty years has been achieved. by the Republican
party, and the people know that the issues arising
out of the war with Spain can be more safely in
trusted to Republicans than to Democrats ; to Mc-
Kinleythan to Bryan. *
It is known that when the treaty with Spain was
under consideration â¢ in - the Senate Bryan urged his
followers in that body to ratify it, and that therefore
he is as responsible as any one else for the Philippine
question and every other problem that has come out
of the treaty.! Moreover, he has among his supporters
men like Morgan of Alab'ama, who are among .the
most imperialistic jingoes of the country; and so,
while he talks anti-imperialism with all -the multitude
of words at this command, he would, -< if -elected, be
surrounded by a worse jingo crowd than could be
found in the Republican party if it were searched, Icr
them.
In fact, as the campaign shapes itself it is becoming
more and .more apparent that the chief issue in the
minds of the people is that "of preserving the existing
prosperity and good : order of the republic,: while
waiting for time and experience^to show what is best
to do with respect to those problems, which are as yet
not clearly : understood. As has v been said by James
H. Eckels, Comptroller of the Currency during the
administration of Cleveland:
"No issue set forth, no matter how cunningly de
vised and ; arranged, can , be made paramount to the
issue of Mr. Bryan himself. No man is fitted for the
Presidency who proclaims, in the midst of a demon
strated - better condition of affairs, the Â¦ reverse to be
true in : order to foment a discord which will gain to
himself and party a political; advantage. Mr. Bryan
hardly appeals to the thoughtful: citizen when; upon
one 'hand he is presented by the Populists and 'on, the
otherby Tammany.. The joining hands with the one
constitutes ah offense against safety in. governmental
administration ; .the alliance with the other an offense
against political decency."
BRITISH HOME POLITICS.
SOME time ago' the London Chronicle an
nounced: "We understand the Cabinet lias de
cided to advise her Majesty to dissolve Parlia
ment duririglthe '."first week in October, should there 1
bo no further developments in the South African situ
ation. The headquarters of both political parties are
acting on the assumption that the dissolution will
come at the time named and are making their prepa
rations accordingly."
Confirmation to the announcement comes from the Â¦
London Times, wfiich, in commenting on Wednes
day on the work of the session, said: "Few among
keen observers of politics doubt that dissolution will
follow prorogation within two or three montha"
We are thus to have a general election; in Great Brit- ;
ain coincidently with our own,, and an object lesson
will be given of the contrast between the methods of.
the two countries in taking ah appeal to the\peoplcY
Our campaign .will 1 last for months, while that of the;
[British will hardly occupy as . many weeks, and? to
that extent their system is better than ours, for.in.a
prolonged contest there \s always more or less dis
turbance of th"c usual business and industry of a peo-i
pie without any, compensating. benefit -politically. "-
It is very well understood that the Ministers advise;
dissolution af this time because they expect the suc
cess achieved in'the South; African war; to help their
party at the polls) They desire to; make the fightTon
the issue of : imperial ' interests rather than on that of
home politics, for on the imperial issue the Tories are
united, while the Liberals are divided. -A' "khaki
campaign," as the British papers call the. scheme, ap
pears to; be 'good^Tory'; politics just now, and it seems :
'evident the Liberals will 5 have to fight at a great dis
advantage.. ', -\ '
Despite all the Ministers may do.' JUowftvcr.it is ccr-,
The Supervisors; have under consideration an i ordi

Public Utilities Committee Postpones
Recommendation on Two Prop
ositions Submitted.
The Supervisors' Committee on Public
Utilities decided on Tuesday night to post
pone recommendations for one week on
the two plans submitted by an Eastern
syndicate and by the Independent Elec
tric Light and Power Company to light
the city's streets and buildings.
A. Brooke Ridley explained the offer of
the Eastern- syndicate to construct the
plant for $1,000,000, to be paid for by the
city in twenty Installments of $275,000 each.
The cost of operation is to be borne by
the syndicate.
F. W. Dohrmann, president of the Mer
chants' Association, was present and ex
pressed* himself in favor of the offer,
which he considered would give fairly
good lighting to tho city. He thought
that certain conditions might arise In the
future, however, that would require ma
ture consideration at present. To his
question whether a* special election would
be required for the purpose Chairman
Reed said that the Supreme , Court had
ruled that if a special election were for
mally called It could be held on the day
of the regular election on November 6.
The offer of the Independent Light and
Power Company to construct a pole lino
system to be sold to; the city for $225,000
was also considered.' After the plant is
Installed bids for electric current will bo
advertised, and the company has offered
to bid 27V4 cents per arc lamp in order to
prevent any raise in the price by any pos
sible combine. A. M. Hunt, manager of
the Independent Company, explained the
proposition to the committeo. It would
cost about $225,000 per year for lighting
under hi? system. Reed said that the cost
of the plant was to be met by three in
stallments of $75,000; each. There would
be difficulty in arranging for the succes
sors of the present board to carry out
the terms of the contract as they might
refuse to pay the installment becoming
due during their term. This Is a serious
obstacle, said Reed, as the city might re
pudiate its contract. .- , â¢â¢ .;.-â¢ . â¢*

Governor Henry T. Gage has gone to
Michigan for a season of rest and medita
tion. t*ri< r to his departure he made com
plete arrungtnw-nts u-lth Lieutenant Gov
ernor Jacob Hart N(ff for the government
of the- commonwealth during his absence.
According to the modus vlwndi Lieuten
ant Governor Neff is to have all the hon
ors, but none of the emoluments applying
to the chief executive station. In fact,
the agreement entered into before the de
parture of Gage provided that Neff should
make no appointments to office. It wa*
stipulated in particular that no one should
be appointed to lill the vacant judicial of
nce Â»n fcacranit-nto. Governor lJuj^ cÂ«n
eidtred mat the general election wuuid
be coming aicng within threÂ« months ana
the voters wouid elect a Judge of tne au
pertor Court of the state for that county,
'ihe reasons which seemed s-j good wnen
applied to Sacramento did not nold pood
so far south as ban lJlego. Gage ttiiea tne
S-aD Diego vacancy just before he railed
for Michigan. Ihe ncsr approach ot the
general election had no restraining influ
ence on the executive mind. Hut Neff. the
happy miner, does not care, lie v.as not
snxjous anyway to appoint a Judge. He
confesses lrankly that he is not a good
judge of Judges. When it comes to sign
ing requisition papers the acting Govei
nor win come to the front in nne style and
nobly atflx his autograph to the .docu
ments. So doubt acting Governor Neif,
if he so desired, could direct Private Sec
retary Foley to produce the offljial letter
book of the Governor ot California and
disclose the contents of that remarkable
letttr which astounded the Attorney Gen
eral, but whether Koley would obey is
culte another question.
ThÂ«> hor.ors reserved for acting.Gover
nor Keff are vast and varied. If he should
fancy a parade in honor of anything or
anybody he could order out the gorgeous
eta'ff of the commander in. chief of th*
land and naval forces of California. He
could order a full-dre*s parade and the
order would be obeyed because no one ever
heard of a Governor's staff .refusing or
cec'lninj? on .any pretext to parade.
Any hour of tne day or night acting
Governor Neff could order Adjutant Gen
eral Seamane to appear in full uniform
and report the condition of iho National
Guard, and Neffs will would be Seamans
pleasure. For Inspiration at dawn and
meditation at twilight the mortal adju
tant general, full panoplied and fierce,
could be ordered into the presence of the
rommtnder in chief. Neff need not say
more then this:
"General, for style on parade you sur
pass anything- that Gage ever Imported
from LÂ»os Angeles, you are not as fat'aa
Parker, but I will be handed If you dnn't
outclass him for pulchritude."
Sfamans would like this sort of thing
and Gage wouldn't care. So casting about
over the field of opportunity one can -find
mnny avenues of honorable pleasure for
an acting Governorâ pleasures quite as
edifying- ar.d ennobling as the joys of ap
pointing Judges and issuing commissions
to notaries public.

Mrs. Dufau went into Shipley's room
Saturday morning, while he was still in
bed, and gathered up all his clothes." She
took his trousers, coat and vest, hat,
shoes and shirt. When she went out she
took his key and locked him in, but pres
ently came back and unlocked the door.
He was captive fast enough without any
bolts and bars.
Young Shipley took matters philosophi
cally and turned over and "went to sleep
again. He stayed in bed that day and
night. Sunday he sat up wrapped in a
red comforter from the bed, his No. 6 feet
encased in a pair of No. 10 shoes that had
been left in the clothes closet by a for
mer lodger. Cigarettes had been his only
sustenance since Friday evening and he
began to feel pangs of hunger ot the sort
that make a man desperate. But there
was the dragon lying in wait. Besides,
he hadn't even a pair of pajamas in which
to venture out" upon the street.
Sunday evening an acquaintance passed
along liush street and Shipley waved a
corner of the red comforter at him as a
signal of distress. The acquaintance
brought up a tin of beans and a bottle of
boor, and went away promising to come
back Monday morning with food and
clothing. He forgot to do so.
All day Monday and all day Tuesday
Shipley sat and shivered as he waited for
the coming of a supply train. The nights
were a blank until he began to dream of
Another acquaintance, Charles Wade of
675 Bush street, passed the Grenoble yes
terday afternoon and learned of Shipley's
distress. He sent a pot pie up to No. 11,
the room occupied by the prisoner. An
hour later Shipley was smoking an after
dinner cigarette and waiting for Wade's
return, either with money to redeem his
clothes or with trousers in ; which . he
might walk forth to freedom.
"I have been losing bills too often of
late," Mrs. Dufau said last evening.
"Shipley will get his clothes back when
he pays. I don't know how he is to get
the money, but he must get it. I am not
keeping him prisoner. He can go out on
the street any time he likes, for all I care.
But I am going to get that room rent
either by this means or pome other."
Shipley claims that he could have se
cured the money to pay the room rent if
he had beert given a fair chance. He says
Mrs Dufau took his clothes not so raucli

Mr. "Wetmore says that the "If" in Mr.
Mills' communication Is significant. Should
the suggested course be taken Mr. Wet
more, i? confident that California will not
be permitted by the French Jurors to get
a gold medal. Three-fourths of the jury
are French. They know that if they give
a gold medal to California It will be used
for all that it is worth. In twenty years
the French have lost the American mar
ket for all wines except champagne. At
Bordeaux In 1S9S gold medals were award
ed to wines from Japan and Chile, but
none to California wine.
Clarence J. Wetmore, president of the
Wetmore-Bowen Company, has .found in
statistics a reason for the raw work on
the part of Paris Exposition jurors con
cerning California wines "exhibited at the
French capital. "I find in Houforts' Cir
cular," said Mr. Wetmore, "that during
the nrst six months of the present year
the total importations into New York of
Bordeaux, iiurgundy and Cette wines
amounted to oniy im.IOu gallons and 41,304
cases. In the same penou California
snipped 5,000.000 gallons* of wine 10 New
Â¦i oik. That tells the whole story. Cali
fornia has taken from. France its' wine
traae, cnampagnes exceptea. The figures
In liouforts' Circular may be relied upon."
Some time ago a sub-committee of the
Jury on wine at -the Paris snow recom
mended that California wines Having upon
tntnr labels the name of any French dia
tiict should be barred from competition.
7ne pretext for this action was that the
labels were misleading. The fallacy ot
thlB claim has been ho- ably exploited in
communications sent on from California
since the proposed action was forecasted
that the jurors would seem to be waver
ing. A communication from Paris, signed
by William H. Mills, which was published
in The Call Tuesday morning, brought In
formation that J. H.- CSore, juror In chief,
now says that all wines will be examined
and that the labels will be referred to the
jury. "If this course 1b pursued," wrote
Mr. Millsâ "and I now have no reason to
doubt that it will beâ whatever award
of merit the California wines will receive
will be upon the naked merit of the arti
cle."

Two Letters frÂ«m Women Helped Through
the "Change of Ufo" by I.y<lla K.JPlnk.
ham's Vegetable Compound.
" Dear Mrs. Pixkham :â When I first
wrote to you I was in a very bad con-
dition. I was passing through the
change of life, and the doctors saidT
had bladder and liver trouble. I had!
suffered for nine years. Doctors failed
to do me any good. Since I have taken
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound, my health has improved very
much. . I will gladly recommend your
medicine to others and am sure that it
will prove as great a' blessing to them
as it has to me." â Mrs. Geo. H.'Jujje,
901 DeKalb Ave., Brooklyn, N. Y.
Relief Came Promptly
" Dkak Mits. Pinkuam : â I had been
under treatment with the doctors for
four years, and seemed to get no better,
I thought I would try your medicine.
My trouble was change of life, and I
must say that I never had anything
help me so much as Lj'dia E. Pink-
ham's Vegetable Compound. Relief
came almost immediately. I havo
better health now than I ever had. I
feel like a new woman, perfectly
strong. I give Lydia E. PinkhamV
Compound all the credit, and would
not do without her medicine for any-
thing. I have recommended it to
several of my friends. There is no
need of women suffering so much for
Mrs. Pinkhum's remedies are a sure
cure."^ â Mahala Littler, Bridge-
water, III.

benefit from its use." â Mary E. James,

W N ; important meeUng of tho Harbor
L\ Commlsslbnftrs â¢ was held yesterday.
/T~V The lease of :.VChina Basin" to the
. Valley, road was under discussion,
and among : those - present were Acting:
Governor Neff, ' Acting Mayor Tobin, At
torney -General Tirey Li. Ford, E. S. Pills
bury, attorney; for the Valley road; A. H.
Payson, vice pVesident of the Valley road,
and Harbor, Commissioners Kilburn, Har
noy and Herold.
The principal speaker, during the con
ference was E.S., Pillsbury. He told how
in 1895 a portion * of "China Basin" was
rented to the Valley road for $1000 a year.
Since that time many improvements have
been made and the State has been receiv
ing a big rental for property that never
brought in a cent before. '
Since the lease was given the Valley
road has been acquired by the Santa Fe.
but the status of things has not been
changed, as the original articles of Incor
poration require the Valley road to re
main a separate body. Â¦
"Under the terms of thÂ« lease of China
Basin to the Valley road certain improve
ments had, to --be made." said Mr. Pills
bury, "and to put the basin in shape ac
cording to these rules would cost a mil
lion dollars. We -would have to build a
retaining wall, whereas we can build a
section of the seawall which will do us
just as well and save the Harbor Com
mission an expenditure of $250,000 at no
very distant date. ,
"The question therefore arises, would it

not be better for us to gfive up our old
leasÂ© and secure a new. one giving, the
Valley road permission to build , a portion
of the- permanent* seawall? The 'portion
we would build would be 2388 feet long by
200 feet deep, and this would reve%to the
State just as soon as the connections now
In contemplation by the Harbor Commis
sioners are made. . : , Â¦ .
: "Some months ago I drew up a form of
a new lease and it has been amended from
time to time since. Three weeks ago Mr.
Payson and I showed it to Mayor Phelan
â¢ana. he was satisfied. .Two weeks ago I
showed it to Governor Gage and he was
satisfied. The lease Is to run for- fifty
years, the same as the original one, and
at the same rent. We want terminaUfa
cilities, and although we have spent three
millions in California we have not even a
foothold as compared with the' Southern
Pacific."
In answer to a question put by Presi
dent Kilfeurn Attorney General Ford said
the board had power to change the lease.
He wanted a penalty attached to the bond,
however. Along with some other clauses
he wanted *his inserted: "And thereupon
and thereby this lease at once ter
minate and be of no further effect for any
purpose." \ - . Â¦ \ Â¦""/<Â¦' Â¦ -:
Pillsbury objected to the Insertion of any.
such clause and said the law provided I
penalty. Then Ford explained that it was
only a matter of extra precaution. Â¦ Act
ing Governor Neff asked to see the lease,
saying hÂ© regretted that Governor Gage
was not present. Finally, it was decided
to allow the matter to go over to Wednes
day next in order to allow the Acting
Governor's attorney to pass on the matter.

"But what I was going to tell you was
how the old gentleman cured me of my
envy of the rich. He. took me down one
day and showed me his famous yacht,
the NourmahaJ. It was a beaut, I tell
you. When I had looked through the
frand saloon and the elegant staterooms,
said: , / â¢
" 'Mr. Astor, I certainly do envy, you,
with all your wealth and your fine yacht

of which bags of straw had been thrown;
so that as early as the tenth century per
manent recesses covered with sacks of
straw and -curtained off from the main
room were constructed in the great halls.
Even these primitive contrivances were
considered the luxuries of the nobility and
the "bed re'afs" and curtains were handed
down from g&eration to generation as
treasured legacies. Although after the
Norman conquest their resting places pre
sented a less shelf like appearance, in
some antiquated places they are in use
at this day. Frederick Lltchfleld in speak
ing of a recent visit to a farmhouse in
Brittany alludes .to the curious beds
which he saw'there, "consisting of shelves
for parents' and children, which form a
cupboard in the wall and are shut in
during the day by a pair of lattice doors
of Moorish design." He furthermore
states that these perches are reached by
means of an oddly carved Moorish chest,
which serves as a step. This quaint fur
niture was doubtless made in the middle
of the fifteenth century and has been
many times handed down -from father to
son. These rudimentary beds were also
a feature of colonial furnishings, and a
veritable one is described by Alice Morse
Earle in her "China Collecting in Amer
ica" as a part of the appointments of an
old New England farmhouse. Such a bed.
was called a "slow bank," which term,
says the author, "is a corruption of 'sloap
bancke,' or sleeping bench, and the slow
bank was the great-grandfather of our
modern cabinet folding bed. At one end
of the room are doors apparently belong
ing to cupboards, which, upon being
swung wide open, disclose the oblong
frame of a bed with a network el ropes
to Berve as springs. This bed frame Is
fastened at one end to the wall with
heavy hinges and was hooked up* against
the wall in the daytime and at night was
lowered to a horizontal position and sup
ported on heavy wooden-turned legs,
which fitted into sockets in the frame."
Fcr many centuries bedsteads were used
only by Kings and Queens and were state
ly affairs, richly carved, unwieldy and of
enormous size. A typical royal bed of the
time of the French renaissance was taken
from the chateau of Pou, where it was the

Unlke the Hebrews, . Greeks and Ro
mans, our English forefathers were un
used to the luxury of the bedstead. Their
makeshifts during the troublous times ot
the middle ages should not have been dig
nified by the name of "bed," which is pri
marily an outcome of peace and prosperi

The bedstead was accordingly banished
to the sleeping room and replaced in the
drawing room by the "day bed"â probably
a carved oak settle containing clothing
within its chest seat, the lid of which was
made comfortable as a daytime lounging
place by means of movable cushions. Next
the banqueting table was relegated to tho

State Forestry Commissioner Rothrock,
who, with other members of the commis
sion, has completed an Inspection of the
forests of Luzerne County, Pennsylvania,
has outlined In brief the purpose of the
State in acquiring large tracts. He said:
"The duty of the commission is to pur
chase three timber reservations. oÂ£ 40.000
acres each, at the headwaters of the three
principal riversâ the Delaware, the Sus
quehanna and the Ohio-. The Idea of these
forest' preserves Is to raise timber on'
ground that will not produce anything
else. The State wants to put the timber
back, and cultivate and rear forests of
the same order as the extensive Black
forest in Germany. The culmination In
our present ideas may not be in this gen
eration. It took Oermany 200 years to
make the famous Black forest what it is
now. But the United States will proba
bly make as much progress In that line in
fifty years as Germany has done In two
centuries.
"The climate of Pennsylvania Is far
more healthful than that of any other
State in the Union, but the people do not
know it. Besides, they cannot enjoy out
door life at present without trespassing
on some one's or corporation's domains.
There will be no need for our citizens to
go to the Adirondacks. to Coiorado. Cali
fornia. Florida or elsewhere when we
once get these timber preserves in full
operation for healthful outdoor recrea
tion. One out of every 1000 persons dies
of pulmonary consumption In the Adiron
dack region, while In the Keystone State
the rate is only onÂ© in every 1330 persons.
"It is only a question of time when
Pennsylvania will be called upon to tak*
care of its consumptives and find a way
to prevent the spread of that dreaded dis
ease. Our State timber reservations will
be the remedy to help the State out of
that dilemma."-Phllaflelphia Ledger.

Mahogany came into general use early
in the eighteenth century owing to the
persistence of a Dr. Gibbon, who wished
to convert some mahogany planks sent
him by his brother, a West Indian captain,
into a candle box for his wife. The joiner
found this foreign wood too hard for his
tools; but the undajunted doctor insisted
upon the use of harder tempered tools,
which succeeded In turning out eventually
a most admirable box. The doctor, de
lichted with the peculiar grain, toughness
and susceptibility and high polish of thta
richly colored wood, n*xt ordered a bureau
made, which so took by storm the court
party that it quickly becamo the rage.
Lltchfleld thinks that the expression,
"putting one's knees under a friend's
mahogany" probably originated about
this time.

of his lecture that he had some misgiv

and lecturers. He rapidly traced the his
tory of the islands, and in doing so dwelt
on the EDlendid services rendered by the
friars, to whom he paid a high tribute,
terming them the advance guard of Span
ish civilization. He Eaid it was usual for
carping critics, who are swayed by bigotry
or who are woefully ignorant, to find
fault in the work of the friars. He sar
castically alluded to the criticisms made
by Bishop Potter of New York. The

When Rev. Joseph P. McQuaide made the
foregoing statement in the course of his
lecture on "Philippine Observations,"
In Metropolitan Temple last night, the au

sentiments of the speaker by applauding
him heartily. It was but a scintillating

CHICAGO, Aug. 8.â Wheat-traders were not
looking for lower cables to-day, following the
sharp advance yesterday in this market, and
when Liverpool reported a decline of IVid j the
effect was marked. Opening prices in Septem
ber showed a decline of 1 ,44f%cand another good
sized fraction was knocked off the price before
the session had progressed very far. Liverpool
reported the decline there was due to improved
weather conditions in England. As there were
no especially bullish features to the domestic
conditions, as the weather was too . hot for
traders to take much Interest, the market, after
the first half hour, degenerated Into a skirmish
between' scalpers, with a perceptible under
current In favor of the selling side. What
little support the market did receive waa chief
ly from local traders, outside interest being ap
parently entirely absent, and the market ruled
heavy until the last hour's trading, when lt be
came really weak. Selling pressure by those
who were on tfre buying side yesterday became
heavier, while there was no increase in the de
mand. Following the* opening decline to 75% tj
75?Â»e, â¢ September eased off to 75^4Â®75%c. It re
covered slowly to 7Cc, which price was reached
in one or two minor transactions, and then
gradually declined until shortly before the close
the market touched 75Uc. The close was heavy
at 75%c.
Corn was dull and heavy for most of the ses
sion. September closed %@"ic lower at 37*ic .
Oats were dull, but comparatively steady in
view of the weakness in other grain markets.
September closed Hie lower at 21%c.
Provisions were almost at a standstill. The
grain weakness had some effect early, causing
.enough local selltnc to depress prlees a little all
around. Packers were lair buyers against cash
Kales, all reporting a good cash demand for
meats. At the close September pork was 10c
lower, lard 2ijc lower and ribs a shade lower.

New York Stock Market.
NEW TORK. Aug. S.â The stock market to
day was duller than yesterday and the move
ment of prices was trivial and insignificant
without an Important exception. The room
traders sold stocks in the morning, impelled,
apparently, by- the report of. heavy gold ship
ments to be exported. Estimates were put out
that the amount of shipments to-day and to
morrow would amount up to over $7,000,000.
When lt was seen that the total would not ex
ceed $3,300,000, the room shorts covered. The
market closed practically lifeless, near to the
last nisht level. There was the usual profes
sional dealing in Sugar and Brooklyn Transit,
the latter suffering from the delay in the pub
lication of the annual report, which had been
promised at 'various times. The large Amer
ican subscriptions to the new British exchequer
bonds continued to absorb a large I amount of
discussion and surmise in Wall street. As an
evidence of the large resources of capital avail
able to the country, the Incident was generally
accepted as a subject for national congratula
tion, but as an evidence of the acute pressure to
which the London money market is being eub-
Jectetf and the possible results on the world at
large of this condition, it was not regarded as re
assuring. It Is evident from the public criti
cism in England of the' large allotment made
to the United States and the apologetic tone of
the explanation to Parliament by the Chan
cellor of the Exchequer, that the policy adopted
was forced by money conditions which might
almost be classed as embarrassing. . There is
evidence of some special provision entered into
with the "leadlns Anglo-American houses In
London," to which was allotted half of the is
nie, to Insure shipments of gold In payment.
The relief thus afforded to the London market
will thus be more direct, but in the last
analysis the stringency of money in London In
sured an ultimate movement of cold.
TJie real cause looming big behind the move
ment of gold is the expenditure and appropria
tions for war shown by the efforts to replenish
the national treasury chests. To-morrow's
shipments of gold to Paris show that that center
is still in competition with London for the
precious metal and the piling up of reserves by
the Bank of France Is now commonly accepted
as a preparation for a pending Russian loan,
said to amount to $200,000,000. The news of the
renewed attack on the legations in Peking, the
progress of hostilities involved In the march on
Peking and the language of the Queen's ad
dreps In proroguing Parliament, all gave force
to these considerations and contributed to the
profound dullness of speculation in securities,
not only In New York, but In all the great
financial markets.
Bonds were neglected and Irregular, Total

Weather Report.
"There Is an abundance of money seeking in
vestment. At present this Is not going Into
either bonds or stocks; but both Investment
and speculative buyers are waiting until tha
market develops more visible strength. The
reasons for anticipating a better market later
on are plentiful and sound. The most serious
Impediment to speculative operations has been
the Chinese situation. Fears that serious for
eign entanglements of some sort might arise
which would derange the foreign money mar
kets, draw gold from New York and send back
American securities, very naturally deterred
anv upward movement In this market. Other
retarding influences have been the crop uncer
tainties and the signs of trade reaction shown
by declining prices and curtailed production in
the iron and textile trades. Election doubts
have not been a factor worth notice thus far."
wonderfully good results, when lt Is remem
bered they compare with two phenomenal
years. Such gains cannot always be expected.
At the same time expenses are often increas
ing very heavily; hence unreasonable expecta
tions of extra dividends are likely to meet with
disappointment. A number of roads have late
ly increased or paid their first dividends, and
this fact has proved the strongest support
which the market has had. There are a num
ber of 4 per cent dividend payers with perma
nent prospects, which are likely to sell at con
siderably higher figures when the Investment
demand again sets in. A good many buyers
are holding oft for lower prices, who may at
any time be obliged to shift their position.

COMMERCIAL AND FINANCIAL NEWS
The Xew York circular cf Henry Clews says
of the condition of trade:
"The crop situation shows Improvement
owing to more favorable weather during the
last week or ten days. The serious damajr" to
â¢wheat has been conflred to the spring wheat
cections of Minnesota end the Dakota*, where
rely about half a crop Is expected. Business
In those sections and the railroads cl.-o will
be unfavorably affected by this less; but else
where the outlook Is promising. In spite of the
damage and the shortage on the Pacific Coast
the 'indications favor a yield of about Â£50.000-
O00 bushels of wheat compared with 547.ooo.ooo
bushels last year. Higher prices, be it noted,
assure a money value considerably In excess of
Ian year. Cera Is In excellent condition; and
If the nsxt few weeks pa*s without Injury from
frost, the yield ir.ay reach over '2.000.000.000
bushels and prove one of the biggest on record
a fact of much consequence to the business In
terests and railroads of the West and South
west. The South is now more prosperous than
for many years; in fact. It Is doubtful if the
South was ever in better condition than to-day.
Cotton costs less to produce than formerly, but
Is bringing verjr profitable price* to both
grower and distributor. The South is alro
benefiting greatly by the diven-iflcation-of. in
dustry, the wonderful development of cotton
manufacturing and the iron Industry' creating
aa era or proFperlty to which that section has
long been a stranger.

of Mr and Mrs. Henry Goodcell of this
city writes from Shanghai under date of
July 8 that no danger exists there, al
though much precautionary work has
been done by the foreigners in the way ot
organization. Goodcell writes that the Chi

remain unmolested, and he thinks they

POISONED BY
HANDLING COIN
OAKLAND. Aug. 8.â Deputy
City Treasurer Charles W.
Cole is an example of the
fact that . dangerous mi
crobes may live, thrive and be car
ried about on gold and silver coins.
For the past six months Cole has
suffered from a distressing skin
disease which baffles the skill of
the best physicians. The eruptions
first appeared on - the fingers, and
the doctors were unanimous In de
claring that the disease was con
tracted from the coins constantly
being handled by the Deputy
Treasurer.
/ .From the fingers one hand and
finally both became affected. Cole
was relieved for a time, but the
eruptions returned later. At the
same time his eyes became infect
ed with a more ; aggravated form
of the disease. .The victim of the
peculiar malady is now under the
care of. Dr. E. N. Ewer.
According to Deputy Treasurer
Cole, the money paid into the of
fice comes in all stages of unclean

old rags, and , again in .greasy
leather ; purses that . have seen
years of service in the pockets of
their none too clean owners. Â¦'-

The meeting was presided ove,r by Dan
McLaughlin, who said he was in charge
of the hot air" department and had se
cured the services of some of the best
hot air artists in AJameda County,
among them President Wheeler of | the'
university." Â¦ <
President Wheeler spoke of the natural
opportunities of Berkeley and the great
future in store for it.
"I like to see n, go-ahead town and a go
nhead people," said President Wheeler,
"and I am glad that I live in a place
where every one is for progression. The
opportunities of Berkeley are unlimited,
and it is for the people of this place^ â all
of the peopleâ to develop and secure the
benefits of these opportunities. A univer
sity In the midst of a manufacturing town
âin with the life of the peopleâ is far bet
ter than one located by Itself. It is better
for the university and for the student! and
for the people."
Dr. H. N. Rowell was the next speaker
to rouse enthusiasm in the audience. Dr.
Rowell has been an earnest and Â¦ a hard

for the hand of her daughter. The mother
told him. that she could not give her con

OAKLAND. Aug. 8.â M. K. Miller, ap
pointed special engineer for the city
to prepare plans and estimates for
the various bond improvements,
has advanced the' most unique and inter
esting plan for the development of tho
West Oakland water front 'that has yet
been suggested. The plans have been
filed with the Oakland City Council and
will | be considered by them later. The
plans involve the expenditure'of $1,700,000,
for which the people will be asked to vote
bonds. The illustration above will give a
clear idea of the plan. Mr. Miller claims
that the property upon which these
wharves are to be constructed is State
water front and outside of the property
which will fall to the Oakland Water
Front Company under the Supreme
Court's water front decision, though the
approach will be over this private grant.
Mr. Miller's report upon this plan is
very elaborate, and closes with this sum
mary:
The best location for a large system of
wharves and docks en the West Oakland shore
Is within the area between the Southern Pacific
Company's mole and the north training; wall.
The plan submitted includes thirty . Individual
wharves from 400 to 800 feet long and 100 feet
wide, with an aggregate frontage of six and a.
fourth miles. The most pronounced features of
the plan are: Firstâ The circular or looi> de-
sign which provides two routes for entrance
upon or departure from each individual wharf
and which also affords a short and direct road
for communication from wharf to wharf
throughout the entire system. Second â All
wharves are placed at an angle with the ap
proach or highway, which enables railroad
trains to enter thereon by easy curves. The
cost of the entire system Is estimated at 11.700.
000, which Includes dredging channels and slips
to a depth of 24 feet at low water and filling
200 acres to an elevation of six feet above high
water. That the main portion of the system
fronting on the pierhead line, comprising eight
large wharves, having a total frontage of two
and a fourth miles. Including a trestle ap
proach 7500 feet long and 40 feet wide, also In
cluding $120,788 for dredging, can be built at an
estimated cost of $450,000.

UNIQUE PLAN FOR DEVELOPING
WEST OAKLAND WATER FRONT
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
HIS Broadway, Aug. S.
The Board of Police Commissioners
propose to weed out all of the policemen
in the department who are physically un
able to perform the most rigorous police
duty. City Attorney Dow has been re
quested to look up the law on the subject.
It is the purpose of Mayor Snow to have
each member of the department examined
as to his physical condition, and those
who fall below the standard will lose
their positions If there Is any law by
which the Mayor can enforce his idea.
All this has come about Because Mayor
Snow has been harassed almost to death,
he declares, by friends of patrolmen who
are trying to secure "soft snaps."
Mayor Snow opened the subject at tha
meeting to-day of the Commissioners.
He 'declared that a lot of unhealthy pa
trolmen had been sending their friends
around to urgo the Mayor to provide bet
ter and easier places for them. They
wanted office assignments or patrol
wagon jobs, or any old place except a
beat patrol.
Chief llodgklns < declared that good,
sound men were required on patrol-wagon
duty, because he wanted to be sure that
when the wagon went after an arrested
person it would return with the prisoner.
Mayor Snow said he was satisfied from
statements made by policemen's friends
that many patrolmen were physically un
fit to walk their beats. He said that the
best interests of the city required, where
the department was small, that every
man should be fit for any kind of duty.
If they could not do that sort of work
they should be retired. If the law did
not give the Commissioners the right to
compel retirement, then the police force
should be increased, said the Mayor.
Chief Hodskins remarked to the Com
missioners that Oakland was the easiest
place on the Pacific Coast for a criminal
to get away from, because of Its extended
territory and the many modes of exit. The
burglars who operate in San Francisco al
ways visit Oakland, said the Chief, and it
was this high class of criminals which
required closest watching.
Weak and Worn-Out Bluecoats Are
Too Numerous and Will' Be
Weeded Out by the Com
missioners.
Mayor. Snow Declares There
Are Too Many Decrepits
on the Force.

Oakland Club Is Bent Into "Warring
Factions After Doing Much
Good Work for the"
Children-
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1118 Hroadway, Aug. h.
The Oakland Club started its career
wiih philanthropy and charity as Its ob
jects, Under the authority of the club
and Jis branches sewing schools were es
tablished, cooking schools were operated,
vacation schools were carried to a suf
ccssful close and a ureat deal of good
work was done for the children of Oak
land.
,\'ow it would gecm that the club is torn
and rent through the very objects for
which it was organized. Resignations are
Leir.g sent In from the members of the
contesting factions and the good work
that has been carried to such a successlul
close is almost forgotten amid the
troubles that have p:ied upon tna cluu
during the past few weeks.
L'pou one side have been aligned Mrs.
Robert Watt. Mrs. K. T. Baroer. Mrs.
lif-nry Goodcell and others. On the other
side there are Mrs. G. W. Bunnell, presi
dent of the club; Mrs. M. I* Wakeman-
Curtis. Mrs. Charles D. Olr.ey and their
friends. The trouble was precipitated
Â¦when Mrs. Kobert Watt was requested ttÂ»
retire from the business management of
the Domestic Science Monthly Magazine,
published by the club. Mrs. \\ att not only
lettred from that but resigned from the
ciub. Then her friends rallied about Mer
and passed resolutions requesting her to
remain with it and at every turn Mrs.
Watt's friends outvoted the other faction
arid she remained triumphant.
There were many stormy meetings, at
which each sloe charged the other with
having tangled the accounts of the vari
ous departments of the club. There waa
talk of demanding resignations arid of in
vestigations to ascertain who had given
Information to the public. On Monday
Mrs. M. L. Wakeman-Curtis. the editor
of the m&frazine. and Mrs. Charles D. OI
ney. the business manager, sent in their
resignations and Mrs. Kobert Watt sent
to the club nearly now worth of receipted
bills which It was claimed she had con
tracted without authority. To-day two
statements were issued as replies to let
ters that have been sent to the club Dy
Mr*. Robert Watt in explanation of her
position. Or.e Is a statement from Mrs.
M. LÂ». Wakeman-Curtis and the other an
open letter to the Oakland Club from C
D. Olney. the husband of the retiring
business manager.
Mrs. Wakeman-Curtis' statement fills
four typewritten pages. The writer ex
ji.ains that the publishing committee of
the Domestic Hoience Monthlv found the
jr^rocatives usurped by Mrs. Watt who
"illegally, irregularly, as an individual.
rot authorized by any vote, demanded the
moneys of the magazine before its bills
had been paid end before that money had
teen paid into the treasury of the de
partment. 1 ' Mrs. Watt claimed, the
writer alleges, the right to use the maga
zine money toward paying for the do
mestic science building, a private philan
thropic enterprise for which Mrs. Watt
alone was responsible. In all, $S5 of mag
fczirn* money was used In this way.
The writer further states that Mrs.
"Watt "collected, held and disbursed mon
eys hen=elf, neglecting and refusing to
rut papers and contracts on file in the
hands of the financial secretary." Worse
than this, "the accounts rendered by Mrs.
Watt of moneys by her collected and ex
rendf-d w^re not completely satisfactory.
Iri June she reported Fhe had collected
from June subscribers $10" 50, from which
Fhe had paid the printer's June bill, leav
ing a small balance on hand. Later the
printer'i June bill was found to be un

count of collections made for the same
month. Ftatine that the collections had
.â¢Â¦mounted to but |47. But subsequently
(frtain firms claimed that they also had
I aid Mrs. Watt amounts due from them
for June advertising, but which collec
tions were not reported. The result is
that the hooks of the magazine and the
records show that Mre. Watt was not a
competent manager of money accounts.
Mrs. Watt offended her associates In
the domestic science department, Mrs.
iWakeman-Curtis states, by peculiar ac
y.: ns and statements. She said, it is al
/'â¢ced. that "the presence of any other
person than myself In this department Is
a mere form, as none of the ladies have
a dollar"; that "the ladles showed a dis
position V> meddle," and that she would
call no more meetings.
"For these reasons and not because
there wa* ar.y personal dislike of Mrs.
AVatt or anything but appreciation and
osterm for her social worth and large
h*arte4 individual work in philanthropy,"
Mrs. Watt was asked to resign.
Charles D. Olney has written, under
date of August 8. to the president and
member* of the club to clear Mrs. Olney
of "unwarranted insinuations," she beinjy
too ill to appear before them. He asserts
That "Mrs. Olney has endeavored from
the first to get sufficient data from the
chairman to open a proper, set of books.
V>ut that such data as she has received
has beÂ«>n fo unsatisfactory and mislead
ing that she was obliged to forego any
attempt at bookkeeping other than a cash
account."

John. Stanton, a Southern Pacific Com
pany switch-tender, was instantly killed
to-day by being struck by a westbound
Haywards local train at the foot of Four
teenth avenue. Stanton, who handles the
switches at that point, was crossing the
tracks to throw a switch after the de
parture of the eastbound local at 2:15
o'clock this afternoon. He did not notice
the swiftly approaching Haywards train,
which hit him and threw him twenty feet.
Stanton was killed in- the presence of
William McUilllgan, to whom he had
been talking at his switchhouse for sev
eral minutes before the accident occurred.
To Deputy Coroner Mottel McGrilligan
paid: "1 had been standing at the switch
house with Stanton, when the Oakland
local pulled out for Frultvale from Brook
lyn depot, a block away. As soon as the
train crossed the switch Stanton left me
to go over and set the switch for the re
turn of the local.
"He had to cross the main line track,
upon which the Haywards local was com
ing at a swift rate. Neither of us noticed
the train until it was too late to save
Stanton. He was knocked twenty feet
and was dead when we got to his body."
The railroad men were greatly surprised
at the accident, because Stanton had been
stationed at the switch for years and was
thoroughly familiar with the operation
of the trains.
Stanton'e body was taken to the
Morgue, where an Inquest will be held to
morrow. He was 46 years old, a native of
Ireland and married. His residence was
at 53 Sixth street

of the San Pablo-avenue school.
Miss Higgins has for the past year been
In charge of the Seventh-street School,
teaching the first grade. When the teach
ers were assigned to positions this term
she was transferred to the third grade of
the San Pablo-avenue School on recom
mendation of Director Phillips. In her
complaint to tho School Directors ML13
Higgins said that the change was a "de
motion," which had been done through
personal motives. She said she had been
treated unjustly, and asked to be rein
stated in her former position.
Director Phillips stated that the chango
had been made after careful considera
tion, and Â¦was approved by School Super
intendent S. D. Waterman.
"We thought," said Mr. Phillips, "that
the best interests of the School Depart
ment would be subserved by the change.
I believe Miss Higgins is better suited to
teach the third grade than the first grade.
Last year while she was In charge of thÂ»
first grade I sent my little girl to her,
and sr.e remained a month without pro
gressing. Then I had the child transfer
red to another school and she immedi
ately commenced to learn. Miss Htggins
dees not seem to be successful in teaching
children who have never before attended
school."
Miss Hlgslns* communication waÂ» ac
companied by another signed by twenty
eight parents whose children had attend
ed Miss Higgins' class, asking that she be
reinstated. â¢Â¦-'_ -.-
School Director Dr. W. Allen moved
that her former position be given to her,
but later changed his motion to refer tho
communication to a special committee.
This was carried, and Directors A. T.
Sutherland, Edward Nlehaus and Dr. W.
Allen appointed.
The salary for flrst-grrade teachers la
larger than the salary for thlrd-grado
teachers. . : -"--'
She Claims That Personal Motive*

tion in the School De
partment.

Charles Fella died this afternoon at his
home. 6C0 Madison avenue, from ptomaine
poisoning, the result of eating tainted
meat which the dead man's widow says
was purchased from the Free Market stall
of Jacob Weil, a repeated offender of the
health laws. Fella was treated a few
hours before his death by Dr. J. F. L.11
ley, who found such evidences of poison-
Ing that he at once reported the case to
Coroner Mehrmann.
According to the story told by Mrs. Fel
la, she with her husband and ' four
children partook on Sunday last of meat
purchased the day before from Jacob
Weil. Fella partook most heartily of the
meat and on Sunday evening complained
of dizziness and eevere pains In the re
gion of the stomach. He refused to send
for a physician until yesterday afternoon.

The Board of Education decided at Its
regular secret session on Tuesday to deny
the protest of parents against the transfer
of the grammar' grade pupils from the
Grant to the. Pacific Heights School. The
appeal of the parents for relief in the mat
ter was the subject of. a long discussion
on the part of the four School Directors,
but the rule adopted' ordering the trans
fers Â¦will remain undisturbed. Chairman
Mark was of the opinion that the parents
Â¦were entitled to consideration and sub
mitted a compromise rule transferring
only the eighth and advanced eighth
gTa'des, but this Â¦was voted down.
It was agreed, \however, that if the
grammar â¢ grades became overcrowded In
the Pacific Heights School the overflow
will be assigned to the Grant School. A

School will in all likelihood, be used as a
primary class, as four primary - classes

Campbell. Is indignant at Parrell's ma
licious action and will prefer charges
against him before the Police Commis
sioners. He denies that his daughter is v a
"hoodlum" and says she is quiet and well
behaved. Parrell was a. sailor, before he
joined the force six years ago, and it is
not the first time he has been in similar
trouble. \^< '/
The policeman did not arrest the girl at
the time, but after brooding over the
slapping for two days he went to War
rant Clerk Burke Tuesday afternoon and
asked for a warrant for her arrest for in
terfering with an officer In the. discharge
of his duty, an indictable misdemeanor.
He said she was a "hoodlum" girl and he
desired to make an example of her. Burke
gave him a warrant for battery, and when
he swore to it before Judge Cabaniss he
asked the Judge to mark it for service
either day or night. To carry out his
petty revenge upon the' young girl, he
waited till nearly 2 o'clock yesterday
morning' before attempting to serve the
warrant. The girl's fatner begged him to
Â¦wait for a few hours and -he. would prom
ise to take her to the prison, but Paxrell
insisted on the girl Â£Â«ting out of bed
and dressing herself, at> he had the war
rant.
Ethel Campbell, a girl 16 years of age,
residing at 613 Second street, was com
pelled to leave her warm bed about 2
o'clock yesterday morning by Policeman
P. J. Parrell and accompany him to the
City Prison, where h* preferred a charge
of batterj' against her. The 'girl's father,
John Campbell, went with her to the
prison and gave $20 cash ball for her re
lease. The girl appeared before Judge
Cabaniss yesterday and the case was dis
missed, Parrell volunteering .the state
ment that he was willing \ this action
should be taken and regretting his con
duct.
Sunday afternoon the girl was walking
along Second street with a friend. Mrs.
Catherine Darcey. when Parrell came up
to them and accused Mrs. Daxcey of being
drunk. The woman became indignant and
Parrell promptly arrested her for disturb
ing the peace. Bthel Is Â¦ a nervous girl
and she became highly excited when Par
rell started to drag her friend to the pa
trol box. She jumped upon Parrell's back
and slapped him behind the ear. Parrell
clung fj his prisoner and sent her to the
City Prison.

"thus play a joke upon some friends,"
Miss Pansy Haggett that was became the
lawfully wedded wife of the man with the
whim on July 11 last and did not know it.
Now that she has discovered she is a
blushing bride Mrs. Pansy Lawrence is
angry, and In a suit filed yesterday she
demands her freedom and her maiden
name again.
In her complaint Mrs. Lawrence charges
that on July 11 and while she and her hus
band were visiting at San Rafael in com
pany with friends the defendant proposed
that she accompany him to the home of a
friend near by and have a marriage cere
mony performed and thus make their
friends victims of a good Joke. Tucked
away In Lawrence's pocket, however, was
a marriage license, regularly procured,
and the "friend near by" was a regularly
ordained minister of the Gospel.
Ignorant cf these facts and assured by
Lawrence that the marriage would be only
a. xnock ceremony, the young lady con
sented to become his wife In play. She
never had considered and positively would
not consider the subject of real marriage
with Lawrence, she says, but now finds,
notwithstanding her aversion to becoming
his wife, such tlie is.
False and fraudulent representations
and concealment of facts were practiced
upon her, she says in conclusion, and she
prays for judgment dissolving and annul
ling the marriage that made her the bride
of a man against'her will and without her
knowledge.
Mrs. Lawrence lives with her parents at
42a 1 .j" Broadway and the man she married
In fun is an extra conductor on the Post-
Etreet line. Attorney John H. Kimball,
who represents the unhappy bride, says
that he has looked Into the case and has
the truth of his client's
nverments. "Even the minister who per
formed the ceremony thought It strange
that Mrs. Lawrence frequently Interrupt
ed the ceremeny with merry peals of
laughter," he said, "and that she did is
proof that the solemnity of legal mar
riage did net occur to her and had no in
fiutnee on her actions. \
Charges That Fraud and Concealm
Were Practiced Upon Her by
the Man Whose Name
She Bears.

Within the last few days five attempts
at burglary in the commercial district and
on Barbary Coast \have been reported.- In
each instance the crooks -pried, the locks
off - the doors,- but were j frightened away
before they had 'a chance to" secure any
booty. Saturday night thieves attempted
to rob a cigar stand in front of a saloon
at the corner of Bush and Kearny streets.
The following night attempts were 'made
to gain entrance to Mullln's shoe store
at Montgomery avenue and Stockton
street and to a restaurant on Leldesdorff,
between Sacramento and Clay -streets.
Next night a Jimmy was used In forcing
open the door of a barber shop at 607 Sac
ramento street and early yesterday morn
ing three men were seen breaking into D.
Ilsca's gun store at 320 Broadway, but
they made their escape.
. The woman reported the burglary, to 'the
officers at the California-street station
and last night Detective George McMa
hon Â¦ and Policeman ... C. Peters J _ arrested
Ben Scobba at the corner of Kearny and
Pacific streets and charged him with hav
ing helped commit the offense. No money
norvnone of" the missing property was
found on him.' Â¦ ' â¢Â¦ v. Â¦
The woman left the premises shortly af
ter 1 o'clock ' and the thieves must have
commenced their operations soon after
ward. They climbed on to the roof : of
an adjoining structure and with a jimmy
forced an entrance through, a window. Â¦-
Late yesterday afternoon Mrs. Joaquina
Valera, the proprietress of a ' saloon "at
42S Pacific street, returned to her placo
of business from a . visit at a friend's
house. She was startled to find that the
upper portion of the ; house had been ran
sacked. Trunks had been pried open with
a hammer, clothes were 'strewn "about, the
floor and the contents of bureau drawers
were scattered in all directions. Every
room presented the same appearance,
each one having been thoroughly search
ed. Gold coin to the amount of- $400 and
$40 in silver were missing. Six diamond
rings that cost several hundred dollars
and which had been secreted in the bot
tom of a trunk -Had been taken, together
with several other pieces of jewelry, in
cluding, bracelets, earrings and breast
pins.

BOLD BURGLARY
COMMITTED ON
PACIFIC STREET
Â¦ADout a.week ago a person giving the
name of Kpbert Davalle called upon Maria
Martinelli, a cigar manutacturer at
Dupont street, and'presented a letter from
A: Benaraini of San Diego, requesting a
loan of some money. Tne woman .knew
Benardini, and not suspecting anything
.wrong advanced $50. Tne man returned
several times with similar requests and
Mrs. Â¦Â¦. Martinelli " ttnally came to the con
clusion .that all was not right. She in
formed the police and the next time Da
valle visited the place he was arrested by
Policeman Chappelle. > ' ..
The prisoner and the letter he had pre
sented, were, taken to the California-street
police station, i The woman and an inter
preter followed'shortly afterward. Chap
pelle turned his prisoner over to the offi
cers at -the station and reported off. A
short was held, during
which Davalle protested his innocence and
seems to, have enlisted the sympathies of
his . hearers. * He exhibited a finger
wrapped in bandages and said it had been
cut. He further stated that the wound
was being treated by Dr. Camillp Bar
sotti, and gave that physician's name as
reference. In a short time he made the
excuse that he wished to have his finger
attended to". and stepped out of the sta
tion. He has not been seen since. Dr.
Barsotti denies that he knows the party.
Mrs.' MartinelH then proceeded to secure
proofs of Davalle's alleged perfidy and
presented the matter before the Chief of
Police in person. A dispatch was sent to
San Diego and an answer was returned
that the letters were not only forgeries,
but that Benardinl had himself been a vic
tim of the man *o the extent of a large
amount. Information was also received
that he is wanted in other places . for
crimes. He has i been known under the
name of A. Gordl." Detective. Cody was
detailed on the case from the Central sta
tion.
A much-wanted criminal eluded the po
lice in a clever manner Tuesday and Chief
of Police Sullivan has detailed a detective
to land him in thetanks If possible. . The
queer feature of .the case Is the fact that
the person : for rn-hom such vigorous
search is now being prosecuted was. once
In -the custody -of the officers, but made
his "escape .from their clutches, and now
there will be no peace until he is recap
tured. - . : .
