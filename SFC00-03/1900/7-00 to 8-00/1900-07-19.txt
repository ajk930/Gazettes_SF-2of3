Fantai of Shantung Issues a De

Authorized by the Imperial

All furniture of churches and Christians la
to bo confiscated and proclamations are to b*
issued exhorting the people to abstain from
robbing Christiana who renounce their U**^
Therefore we exhort you. according to the In
structions of our Government, and authorize
all magistrates to compel native C*rlstians to
return to their former rcligrZch and maka them
give security that they will not again enter a
Christian church.
What, therefore, can be considered a jocd
method to stop trouble? To stop the pot boll Ins
over the fuel mvst be pulled out from below,
but tSe native Christians are part of our peo
ple and since they have been deceived by tha
foreigners they have lost the right road. If
they could be brought back to the right path
way they would be our loyal people again. In
this way mutual hatred wculil cease and tran
cruillity be restored.
The calamity has its siurce with the native
Christiana, who have clothed themselves with
the power of foreigners. Relying on this power
native Christians have insulted the people to
such an extent as to engender the greatest
hatred and the ooc.ifion has been taken ad
vantage of by lawless men to carry out evil
dfsigns, such as burning and robbing.

*^ the highest legal official of
the province and next In rank

subordinates, the magistrates of the prov

It purports to be addressed to and record
a conversation between the government
and the Fantai, but that is possibly a sub
terfuge to Impose. upon the magistrates.
The Fantai is notoriously anti-Christian
and his letter cannot fall to have evil con
sequences. It is as follows:

POWERS ALREADY
ARE QUARRELING
Grave Dissensions Arise and
There Are Prospects of Dis
putes That May Disrupt the
Present Concert.
m ONDOX, July 19, 4 a. m.â While evl
_jf7 dence accumulates dally that China
*"^V has long been preparing a formid
able military organization in antic
ipation of the present conflict and that the
area of the rebellion is continuously ex
tending, harmony among the allies, which
Is necessary to meet such a grave situa
tion, Is still deplorably lacking. The Rus
sians have refused Admiral Seymour's re
quest to hand over the restored Taku-
Tientsin Railway, to the English com
pany, and it is rumored that. Germany
purposes .taking a -Ferlous^ Independent
step â namely, to "patrol 'the Yang-tse-
Kiang with men-of-war. Such a step
would be greatly resented by England
Still more alarming news has been con
veyed to the Daily , Express from Tokio,'
to the effect that the apparent reluctance
of Germany- and Russia to consent to a
Japanese commander for the army corps
has led the Japanese Government to de
lay the forwarding of the division already
mobilized. The Standard, in an alarmist
editorial, says: Â¦ . " .
"It is useless any ; longer to hide from
ourselves the fact'that China has declared
war on* civilization .and has plunged Into
thÂ©p conflict with' rabid frenzy. It is
equally futile to discuss whether hostil
ities arc being waged by the Chinese Gov
ernment, inasmuch as it is evident that
an administration of seme kind exists and
is directing the- anti-foreign movement.
Unless unmistakable evidence exculpating
the Peking Government is promptly forth
coming the powers should treat China as
a belligerent state and act accordingly."
A similar line of comment is taken by
the other morning â¢ papers. Â¦ All applaud
the course of Count von Bulow, the Ger
man Foreign Secretary, in stopping cipher
telegrams from, the Chinese legation in
Berlin and , all urge the other* powers to
follow Germany's example.'
The Russian greneral staff deny the re
port that the Chinese have captured Blag

that the Russians have taken 4 Algun. ~
Thousands of Chinese, Slain;
A Tientsin correspondent Â¦ asserts that
thousands of Chinese 'were killed and that
fighting was still going 'oh, when his dis
patch, was sent, -in various parts of Tien
tsin. â¢ . '
With' reference to the rumors that Eu
ropeans were seen working* the Chinese
ST. PETERSBURG, July 18.â Reports have been re
ceived by the Russian general staff from the Amoor district show
ing that the Chinese have made serious preparations there and
are now concentrated on the railway line from Aigun to Sakha
lin. They are well supplied with artillery and have large quan
tities of munitions. The Russian general, Gribovsky, after recon
noitering the district, returned to Blagovetchensk, the capital of
the province of Amoor, on Monday.
Other official reports confirm the serious news of the stop
page of work on the Manchurian railway, owing to Chinese at
tacks, especially at Charbin, where an attack by. four hundred
Chinese was repulsed on July 9. Charbin is in a critical state,
being cut of! from the west, south and north. Russian troops
have been sent from different points to protect the railway. The
Chinese, however, are still working on the eastern section of the
line, which gives hope that energetic measures may succeed in
restoring order.
In the opinion of the 'staff officers, the chief command of*
the allied forces at Tientsin will eventually fall to Duke Aliexoff
in addition to the Japanese commander in chief.

OFFICERS OF THE UNITED STATES MARINES ENGAGED AT. TIENTSIN.
Saturday (via Chefu, July i/).-*â The Russians
made up the right wing- of the international column in the
advance on the native town of Tientsin on Friday. As they
moved steadily over the open plain toward the entrance of the
city the Chinese shelled steadily from the walls. The Russians
lost 300 killed and wounded.
During the night the Japanese, Americans and some Eng
lish troops attacked the city on the left wing. The Japanese
shelled the walls, and, making a breach, gallantly entered first of
of all the international troops. The Americans occupied the
most dangerous position and were forced to advance over abso
lutely unprotected ground. The Ninth Infantry and a handful
of marines lost many killed and wounded. Colonel Liscum was
killed while leading his men. The Welsh Fusiliers and the Wei-
Hai-Wei regiment came up on the American right. The Chi
nese defended the walls bravely, but fled once a breach was
made. The city was occupied by the international troops, who
found dead Chinese lying about the streets in hundreds. To
night the city is in flames.
Though the taking of the city will have the effect of discour
aging the Boxers, the total loss to the foreigners is thought to
be 1 200 dead and wounded.

LONDON, July 19.â The Shanghai correspondent of the
Daily Express asserts that he has ascertained from an unimpeach
able source that when the question of an alliance between China
and Japan was under consideration last autumn, the Empress
Dowager sent a commissioner to Tokio with secret proposals to
the Mikado.
"These proposals," says the correspondent, "contemplated
the conclusion of a secret treaty having the object of destroying
all European and American influence in both China and Japan,
the wholesale massacre of foreigners and the division" of the
whole of Eastern Asia from Burmah to Siberia between China
and Japan. The special commissioner took a code, prepared by
Li Hung Chang and Sheng, for secret communication between
the Empress Dowager and the Mikado. The Japanese Emperor
utterly declined to entertain the proposals."

XEYV YORK. July iq.â The Journal has this from Lon
don: It is by order of the imperial Government at Peking that
Chinese commanders have stopped navigation on the river
Amur, firing upon the Muscovite transports and forcing them to
retreat. It is in deference to the same commands, emanating
from the Government at Peking, that Chinese regular troops
have invaded Siberia, penetrating some twenty miles in the Char's
dominions and bombarding BlÂ»igbvetchensk. the capital of Amur
province.
This in itself is equivalent to a declaration of war against
Russia, which, construing it as such, has handed the Chinese
Envoy at St. Petersburg his passports to-day and requested him
to leave the country, along with mernbers of his mission.

TON". July 1*.â Major Ger.eral Mac-
Arthur has placed himself on rec
ord as Btltingly opposed to the with
drawal of troops from the Philippines for
service in China. If General MacArthur
tiad his way his force would be increased
instead of reduced. He urgently repre
sented to Secretary Root that under the
pyftcm of crarrisons adopted it is impossl
lile to redistribute the force when the rep
imrris are withdrawn, to properly patrol
the district from which- they have bf.cn
taken. Secretary Hoot thoroughly appre
ciates General MarArthur's vfews, bm the
urgency of the situation in China is such
that he is compelled to detach regiments
tfr->m the Philippine* to send to Taku.
Throuprh reports and private letters

manifest that the suppression of the Fili

is certainly the opinion of almost every

from those officers sharply criticize the

the policy of the administration, and one
officer, writing' to an official, state? that

WASHINGTON. July IS.â General "Wood
spent three hours with the Secretary of
War. The Cuban situation was gone over
thoroughly. General Wood reiterated his
opinion that It would be very undesirable
to withdraw more than the three regi
ments now under orders to leave the isl
and. The removal of the troops now under
orders will reduce the American force in
Cuba to a little more than 5000. These
General Wood considers essential to the
welfare of the island till after the coming
constitutional convention. The date for
this has not yet been fixed rind about
six weeks" notice will have to be given,
owing to the slowness of rural communi
cation. The election of delegates to the
convention probably will be over by the
1st of October. The Cubans do not want
the American troops replaced by native
volunteers at this time, because of the
opening this would make for a military
dictatorship. After the constitutional con
vention it may be possible to reduce the
insular force still further.
It is understood that Secretary Root
coincides with General Wood's views after
the situation has been fully explained, and
that no further draft will be made on the
Cuban force at present.

NEW YORK, July 19. â The World has this from London:
Russia is preparing to make a descent on China from Manchuria. She is massing there
a great army of Cossacks and is using the Siberian railway exclusively for military operations.
An army of 200,000 Russians may invade China from the north by the first of August. This
step makes a clash of the nations in China possible.
England has already withdrawn Admiral Seymour from command of the allied foreign
land forces at Tientsin, because his services are needed in command of England's fleet. The
Russian admiral. Alexieff, who, next to Seymour, has the highest rank of all the foreign of
ficers, succeeds Seymour as chief of the land forces. '
There is apparently no unity of action by the allies in China. The present international
sympathies se.em to make this alignment â the United States, England and Japan against
Russia. Germany and France.

FELL BACK UNDER
COVER OF DARKNESS
TIENTSIN, Friday, July 13. 7 p. m. (via
Chefu, July 16, and Shanghai, July IS.â
The battle which was begun with the at
tack by 7000 allied forces upon the wall?>
of the native city at 2 o'clock this after
noon continued all day, two battalions of
the Ninth Infantry participating. It is
reported that 215 of this command were
killed or wounded, including ten or fifteen
officers. Colonel E. H. Liscum was killed
and Majors Jesse M. Lee and James Re
gan, Captains Charles R. Noyes, Andrew
Brewster and Edwin V. Bookmlller and
First Lieutenants William K. Naylor.
Louis B. Lawton, Harold Hammond and
I. C. Waldron were wounded.
Among the United States marines the
casualties numbered forty. Captain A. R.
Davis was killed and Captain William B.
Lemley and First Lieutenants Henry
Leonard and S. D. Butler were wounded.
The American contingent, after lying in
shallow, hastily dug trenches, full of
water, facing the south wall of the city,
and suffering for want of water and food,
besides being short of ammunition, was
ordered by General Dorward to retire un- '
der cover; of darkness.
The Russians were outside the cast wall,
while the Japanese. British and French
were close to the west wall, with the Chi- \
nese trying to flank them. The walls
were sadly battered by shells. The at
tack will be renewed in the morning. The
total losses of the. allied forces are esti
mated at 800.
ROCKHILL WILL NOT
RETURN TO THE ORIENT
WASHINGTON, July 18.â One of the
first callers at the State Department to
day was W. W. Rockhill, director of the
Bureau of American Republics, whose
name has been mentioned as a possible
successor of Minister Conger, as the
United States representative in China, in
case the latter is dead. After his inter
view with the Secretary of State, Mr.
Rockhill said that he had no expectation
of returning to the Orient.
Mr. Rockhill is one of the few officials
who still retain a remnant of hope that
some members of the legation in Peking
may have escaped. His hope for the fugi
tives is based on his knowledge of the re
lations existing for the past twenty years
between Sir Robert Hunt, the British
customs officer, and some of the most
powerful officials in Peking.' Some of
these officials owe all they have to the
friendship of Sir Robert Hart, and it is.
' within the limits of possibility that they
! have been able to secrete at least some of
the women of the foregn party where they
can weather the storm until relief reaches
Peking.
This is only a possibility, but coming
from one familiar with the Chinese situa
tion, it contains at least a ray of hope
for those who have friends In Peking.

Tientsin on July 14 says:
"When the citadel was captured sixty
two guns fell Into the hands of the allies."
-The German commander said also:
"Regular railway communication between

Chinese Merchants and Gentry of Canton in Vaim
. Plead That He ' RemaJn to Accord *
Them Protection.
HONGKONG, Tuesday, July 17.â LI
Hung Chang, despite all attempts
of Europeans to persuade him to
remain, left Canton this morning
for Peking. Prior to his depart
ure Chinese merchants and gentry of Can
ton strongly appealed to the Viceroy not
to leave, and presented a petition setting
forth that Canton, so long the prey to the
depredations of robbers and pirates, had
been inhabitable during Li Hung Chang's
Vlceroyalty; that disturbances had been
repressed with a strong hand, and that
the people were enabled to live without
being panic-stricken when dogs barked.
The petitioners, this paper continued,
learned with trembling that their pro
tector was proceeding north, and they
v.-ept as at the loss of a parent.. The ab
sence of rebellion and piracy being solely
due to tho presence of L.1 Hung Chajig,
the merchants were ready to cast them
selves before the wheels of his chariot to
prevent his departure.
A significant passage in lbe appeal pre
sc-nted to Li Hung Chang by the Chinese
merchants and gentry of Hongkong re
questing him not to leave that city, men
tions that Canton has only provisions for
four months and urges the formation of a
company to buy rice abroad and to pre
pare to resist foreign Invasion and to pro
tect the frontier.

This letter also states that the commander of the Chinese fleet, when he was called upon to surrender, did so, in the face of. a vastly superior naval force of
the allied nations; but upon being taken aboard the German ship he took his life- with a revolver after saying that he preferred death to being returned to his coun
trymen after having surrendered. He declared he would be put to the most, horrible torture before being killed by his own countrymen.
VALLEJO, July 17. â A private letter, dated June 19, received here to-day by the wife of a naval officer from her husband, who is with the Asiatic squadron,
says in regard to the heroism of Captain B. H. McCalla, who commanded the first landing party after the outbreak of the Chinese trouble:
*'Many, words of praise arc spoken as to the heroism of Captain B. H. McCalla, who, when he landed, demanded a train to transport his men to Pe
king, and on being refused seized a train and ran his men to Peking, and was the first to enter the city and place a guard around the legations. Having accomplish
ed this away ahead of any European power, he returned to Taku for reinforcements. The railroad was destroyed and he was unable to return to Peking, but he is
now with Admiral Seymour fighting his way to unfortunate Peking."
WASHINGTON. July 18. â The
State Department has received
a dispatch from Consul General
Fowler at Chefu saying that
the Governor of Shantung
wires that his courier left Peking on July
9 The legations were still holding 1 out.
'United States Minister Allen at Seoul
cables the State Department that Boxers
and Chinese, are in force within a few
miles of the Korean frontier. The natives
of Ping Yan. the most northern province
of Korea, are much ajarmed and are flee
ing. The foreigners remain in safety. .The
Government is very anxious.
The buoyant and hopeful feeling of yes
terday as to the Chinese situation was
strengthened to-day by the addition of
the confirmatory dispatch from Consul
Fowler, at Chefu, touching the safety of
the legationers at Peking on July 9. Of
course it is understood that" Mr.. Fowler's
information came from the fountain head,
as did Mr. Wu's of yesterday, namely the
famous Yuan Shan Kai, the Military Gov
ernor of Shantung province. Because
of the very intimate relations that have
existed up to a very recent date between
this official and the imperial court at Pe
king, he having been commander of the
imperial bodyguard, there Is a disposition
here to attach more credence to his dis
patches than. would be accorded to those
of other Chinese officials. This is based
on the presumption that he has no Induce
ment to falsify the facts".
The Chinese Minister called on Secre
tary Hay this morning and had a ten min
utes' talk with him. Minister Wu said he
had received no official information, but
thought the situation looked much
brighter as a result of dispatches received
yesterday.
Repeats the Claim of Shan
tung's Governor That the
Legations Were Safe on
the Ninth of July.
HOPE REVIVED BY
FOWLER'S MESSAGE
The Secretary made known to Mr. "Wu
the dispatch from Consul Fowler at Che
fu. quoting the Governor of Shantung as
sterling that the legatloners at Peking
wore safe on the 9th ir.st.. and this was
accepted by him as confirmatory of his
dispatch yesterday. Minister Wu said
there was not the slightest doubt about
the date being the Oth. although London
cables suggested that the Sth referred to
the Chinese calendar and meant the fifth
day by the English calendar. On the con
trary, the dispatch received bv him men
tioned the 13th as the date, which by the
Chinese calendar corresponds with the 9th
of our calendar.
SIR ROBERT HART REFUSED
TO ESCAPE IN DISGUISE
LONDON. July IS.â The Shanghai corre
spondent of the Mall learns that Prince
Ching concocted a scheme to enable Sir
Robert Hart to escape disguised from the
British legation on July 4. Sir Robert,
however, refused to desert the other in
mates of the legation, and he twice wrote
to Prince Tuan asking him to spare the
lives of all the foreigners. Prince Tuan.
however, did rot make any reply and Sir
Robert is believed to have perished on the
night of July 6, during the massacre.
CALL. HEADQUARTERS. WEL
LINGTON HOTEL, WASHING
TON, July 18.â President McKinley
will leave Washington to return to
Canton to-morrow night if no news
is received from China in the meantime
which will make his presence at the
White House necessary.
No formal meeting of the Cabinet was
held to-day, though Secretary, Root en
tertained the President, all members of
the Cabinet and a few others. Including
Major General Wood, at a dinner at the
Country Club and the Chinese situation
was informally discussed. A meeting of
the Cabinet has been called for to-morrow
morning at 11 o'clock. .
It seems that at the beginning of the
negotiations between the powers there
was grave danger of a failure of concerted
action among them, resulting in delays
which would have endangered all foreign
interests in China. Secretary Hay's note
to the representatives of the United States
at foreign capitals, setting forth clearly
the purposes of the United States, gave
the powers a firm basis on which to pro
ceed, and, as various countries interested,
one after another, have adopted the sub
stance of Mr. Hay's note as expressing
their own purposes, most of the diplo
matic difficulties in the situation have
disappeared.
. There has been no hard and fast agree-
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ment as to policy to be pursued and there
will be no agreement as to the rehabili
tation of the Chinese Government until
the allied forces have reached Peking and
something definite is known as to the fate
of the Emperor's government and how far
the Emperor's advisers, the Empress
Dowager or the high court officials may
have been implicated in the anti-foreign
outbreak.
There probably will be diplomatic tan
gles in abundance to be solved when
this stage is reached, but in the mean
time the powers will work together to put
down the insurrection and save China
from her own people. A tentative proposi
tion Is under consideration by the various
powers for the appointment of an inter
national commission to investigate the
entire Chinese question and map out a
plan for the co-operation of the powers
for the future government of China In
such a way as to give assurance of the
safety of foreigners and their property in
the empire. This proposition has not yet
taken delinlte shape, however. There is
not at present even an agreement as to
the quota of troops that each power Is to
furnish.
; Each government is at liberty to send
as many as it may desire or to withhold
military assistance altogether if it so de
sires. Self-interest, however, will impel
each country to send a respectable force
as each having an Interest In China will'
see to it that its participation 1n military
operatons are on a scale sufficient to give
it a voice in the final settlement.
THE evening papers seem to have misunderstood the object of the See
Yup merchants in calling the mass meeting of Chinese citizens which
was held at the Assembly Hall of the Xing Yung Association on
"Waverley Place, between Sacramento and Clay streets, this afternoon.
It was not by reason of fear of any possible rising against Chi
nese of the State that this meeting was called by the association. It was
only just that as a reciprocation for the kind words and acts of the people
of San Francisco when > we were in quarantine we should publicly ex
press the sympathy which we feel for them in this trying time, when such
painful and deplorable occurrences are taking place in our country. The
merchants of San Francisco supplied us with food for the Chinese poor, and
we know that v.-e are safe among people who have such generous impulses.
Another statement of the evening papers which I wish to explain is this:
It v.-as said that Wong Chung, secretary of the Six Companies, knew nothing
about the meeting. The reason of that was that this meeting was called by
the See Yup Association and it had no connection with the Six "Companies
whatever except that members might attend in their individual capacity.
The results of the meeting were more than the mere expression of the
resolutions cf -sympathy which they passed, for in addition to that I was
asked to attend in my official capacity for the purpose of receiving from the
assembled merchants a request that I should as Imperial Consul forward
to Viceroy Li Hung Chang a petition begging his protection for the foreign
ers resident in China.
This I shall promptly do. HO YOW

"Whatever may be the ultimate policy of
the powers, the immediate effect of the
successful defense of the foreign quarter
at Teintsin is distinctly quieting and re
assuring. .The allied armies are fighting
there tor the prevention of a massacre
and the protection of foreign interests
through the Chinese empire.
The retreat of the foreign contingents
to the coast would be the signal for the
yellow terrorism in every quarter of the
seaboard and the interior.
While the improvement in the situation
at Tientsin is considerable, the Chinese
rebels are swarming outside the city and
there are strong reasons for believing that
the bulk of the regular army is saturated
with the Boxers' spirit of hatred against
foreigners.

SHANGHAI VERY GRAVE
CHICAGO, July 18.â A dis
patch from Chefu, July 15,
via Shanghai, July 18, says:
A communication was re
ceived to-day by the Japanese
Consul from the Japanese
Minister at Peking, dated
June 29. It said that all the
minors -were in the British le
gation, short of food, hard
pressed and unable to hold out
many days.
(This is significant, for it is
the latest dispatch from Pe
king, aside from those through
Chinese sources since Sir
Robert Hart's message of June
6, when he said the guns were
trained on the legation.)
v\ e assert that this opening up cf China
cannot be too quickly done. The country
must be threaded with railroads, factories
must be built, cities must be sanatized and
human life in every way conserved. A
sharp line must be drawn between the past
and present, and the forces of ancient
China must be held firmly In check by the
forces of modern China and of the western
world. We feel that with the help of the
west the millions of progressive people who
have come under western Influence 1 , sub
jects of China, will be able to effect this
end. And we express the hope that no ir
ritation, such as the seliure of new ter
ritory by foreign nations, shall be effected
to the lasting disturbance of the peace of
the country.
We commend In every respect the wise

LATEST DISPATCH
FROM FOREIGNERS
IN THE LEGATIONS
See Yups Want China Opened.
The See Yup Association also passed
resolutions expressing its sympathy with
the American people for the teinbie ou.
rages their countrymen hud receivfd at
the hands of the Boxers and express'ng
in strong- language Its detestation of the
Hoxers and the hope that the latter would
be pp.-edily exterminated by the alii* d
forces. The See Yups also commended the
wise desire of the United States to keep
the Chinese Empire Intact and to invest
it with a strong native government that
will bring peace to the country and safety
to all foreigners.
This meeting was held at 25 Waverly
Place in the hall or the Xing Yung Com
pany. The president sat at the head of
a long table. On his right sat the Chinese
consul and on his left the secretary of the
association. Around the table the various
officers sat and quietly smoked while the
president and Ho Yow did all the talking.
Mhe crowd which surrounded the table
was live or six deep and the members
listened to the proceedings with interest
and with grunfs of approval.
The resolutions adopted bv the See Yups
are as follows: r
The bee lup Commercial Association, the
leading Chinese commercial organization of
the State of California and of the United
States, considering the present conditions
in Chlr.a in regard to the Boxer Insurrec
tion, herewith extends to the people of the
State of California and of the United States
gent-rally its profound sympathies for the
luis of life and property which have been
inflicted upon citir.ens of the United States
by these murderous Boxer outlaws. It is
our. hope that the t'nlted States and other
w-estern nations aiding the law-abiding ele
ir.ent of Chine and its representatives in
the Government of China, will speedily re
rtore order ir. our distracted country and
will with an unyielding hand Bslze and
IjUmMi the perpetrators of these awful out
rages.
We declare our utter detestation of the
Boxers and all their sympathisers and as
sort that the greatest* harm ever lntl!ct-l
upon Chlr.a has been produced by their
acts. Kspecially do we deplore the re
ported death of Minister Conger and his
estimable family and the reported deaths
of the other foreign Ministers and their
families resident In Peking, and express
the profoundest hope that these reports are
wholly untrue. In ths event, however, of
their unhappy truth we can but feel that
they have been martyrs to the cause of
western civilization In what Is numerically
the greatest of the nations, for we cannot
but perceive that as a result of their loss
a Kfiverr.ment will be imfilanted In China
which will make absolutely secure the lives
Of all persons and their properties within
the empire, and that the empire will be
speedily opened up to commerce and In
dustry, as these terms are interpreted by

of Boxers and Admiration for

T1VO largely attended Chinese mass
mÂ«-otinjrs were held in San Fran
cisco's Chinatown yesterday, mer
chants, laborers and all classes of
Chinamen being In attendance.
The meetings were held under the aus
pices of the King Yur.g and the See Yup
associations and were for the purpose of
taking acticn regarding the present se
rious condition of affairs in China, which
vitally afreets the Chinese residents of
the United States.
The leading Chinese citizens and mer
chants had the meetings called for the
purpose of thowi.ig the gt>od will of their
people here toward this Government and
its people.
The Nlr.gr Yung meeting was held at the
headquarters of that association ana was
presided over by .Ng isj LMBi president;
l-ee Wan Cna. vice president, ana 'Wong
You, secretary.
Ho Vow. the Imperial Chinese Consul,
was there in his many colored robes of
eilJt and was the leaUing spirit of the
meeting. He presented a set of resolu
tions oeplonng the atrocities of the iiox
t-rs ana expressing sympathy with- the
Americans for the loss or life and prop
erty muttered L>y their peopJe. These were
adopted without dissent. It was also de
termined to cable Li Hung Chang, Vice
roy of Canton, asking him to use his good
< ll-.ccs in proventing a. repetition of the
past outrages in China upon the foreign
ers. The larger part of me Chinese resi
dents bere are natives of Canton and are
looked upon by the Boxers as their nat
ural enemies and consequently many of
the Cantonese have been slaughtered dur
ing the present reign of terror.
The resolutions adopted follow.

We declare the Boxer uprising to lÂ« an
insurrection against the Government of
CT.ina and the people who participate jn
It to be marauders, mur<>rers and rob

IÂ«rsor.s Â£nd their acts fo far as such acts
are against the wettprn people*, and so

We call upon tfcÂ« peoples of the west
to remark that thÂ«>ir friends have not alone
b<wn sufferers in China by these outrages,
but that the Chinese people themselves have
be*-n slaughtered by thousands by these same
murderous outlaws, and that the Govern

protect these mest valued cf its subjects
as It has been to protect the western peo
ple abiding in their midst.
Â»â¢ e express our* most profound and heart
felt Fyrr.r-athy with the western people and
Â¦with she people of the United States for
the Injuries' which they and their friends
have Euftored at th? hand? of these crim

nest hope that the armies of the west
now moving upen China will not alone re
tt'.re peace, but will seize and punish with
extrene j-or.altie* these persons who have
t*T tullty o f these atrocities.
We hore. furthermore, that the people
of the wt-s=t will install in China a govern
ment airj>Ie in powrr to protect both the
people of CTilr.a and the foreigners and

One of the interesting 1 features of the
day was the exhibition of rapid writing
on the blackboard given by Robert F.
Gallagher of this city, secretary of the as
sociation. A portion of a murder trial
transcript was read to him and he took it
down, without a single error, at the rate
of 267 words a minute, and then com
plained that the dictation was not rapid
enough for him. At practice on the previ
ous evening, in the presence of a number
of members of the association, he attain
ed a speed of 286 words, which he claims
to be the limit for blackboard work.
Charles F. Whitton of Oakland read

CLOSING SESSION OF
THE STENOGRAPHERS
One-Twelfth Provision of Charter
Makes Only $200 per Month
Available.
The operation of the one-twelfth act
which has been incorporated in the char
ter may be answerable for the failure of
those, holding demands against the fund
for the Fourth of July celebration to be
paid the money legallv due them until
July 1. 1901. The fund set aside for th~
celebration was $2T.OO. but the committee
having the affair in charge expended only
S2365. and Acting Mayor Tobin. who in
the absence of Mayer Phelan has control
of the # expenditures and their payment,
sent a 'demand for the money to the Au
ditor yesterday.
Auditor Wells found himself in a quan
dary, as the charter specifically provides
that it shall be unlawful to pay any de
mand which shall exceed one-twelfth part
of the amount of the total appropriation.
According" to this larguage; only a little
over J200 monthly will be available to
pay the expenses of the Fourth of July
celebration, and the last proportion will
be collectable In June of next year.
A number of those having bills against
the fund visited Acting Mayor Tobln yes
terday and he promised to devise soma
way out of the difficulty. It may be nec
essary for the Supervisors- to pass an or
dinance exempting the fund from the one
twelfth provision, though even that course
may be deemed illegal, following the clear
language of the charter. The $000 appro
priation for the twelve clerks on the
Board of Equalization may be similarly
affected and they may be able to collect
but $6 monthly during the next twelve
months until their demands have been
fully paid. Wells has submitted the ques
tion to his attorneys, Lloyd & Wood.
PAYMENT OF FOURTH OF
JULY DEMANDS DELAYED
ise that $50 was to be paid into the hands
of Wilbur for others' uses. From each
was also to^Aie exacted two promissory
notes of $25 each, one payable at the enu
of the ilrst month of labor in the new
position, the second at the termination of
the second month. In the face of these
conditions, Wilbur alleges, Conroy di
rected iie should exact from seekers of
political patronage a portion of tfre origi
nal sum demanded to seal the bargain.
From some amounts as small as ?15 was
received, but In these instances the politi
cal sharks exacted an additional promise
that when the position was ready for oc
cupancy, when the "goods were there for
delivery," he upon whose head the fortune
had fallen would have to make good the
balance of the first $50 installment due,
whether It was begged, borrowed or
stolen, else the position that waited for
him would pass into the keeping of one
more fortunate in the matter of finance.
James Wood, whose name appears among
the victims of the clique, of which E. D.
Wilbur acted as "middleman" and who
charges under oath, at least by Innuendo,
that he was but the slave of Edward C.
Conroy, ex-bookmaker and now dictator
In a small but fruitful field, has a better
right than any to wish and prophesy the
end of crimes of the like of which he is a
victim. Pretty babies brighten the home
of Mr. Wood. For some time he has found
labor scarce, and when, at the solicitation
of a friend, he turned a listening ear to
the gilded promises of Wilbur and his
clique he saw hope ahead for better times
for him and his.
Wilbur's Statement.
In the early part of* 1899, during the
months of May and June of that year, i
Wilbur went forth,-as his affidavit at least
by Innuendo certifies, at the instance of
Edward C. Conroy, to drag within the*
meshes of his net those men seeking em
ployment who could be induced to dis
gorge, even though small amounts, in re
sponse to promises of political situations.
So skillfully did he handle the duty placed
in his hands that for months those unfor
tunate artisans who paid money for the
promises of Wilbur walked the streets,
happy in the thought that at last they
influence was sufficient to place
him. Wilbur's first demand was
for $50 and two promissory notes, In ac
cordance with the terms stated. Ferren
produced $40 in gold, gave his pVomlse to
pay $10 more on receiving his position,
and to honor the notes when they became
due. Satisfied that he would receive con
sideration at least, he went away satis
fied that the future would see him in a
State position. As the weeks passed he
became impatient. Seeking for Wilbur he
often found him busy, while around him
hovered the forms of others of Ferren's
craft. Each became suspicious that Wil
bur held more money and more promis
sory notes than his, and finally these
men were drawn together by common im
pulse, and then the game Wilbur had
played and lost became known.
Wilbur was approached by one he had
fleeced with a promise of a position as a
carpenter on the water front and was In
formed that the time had come for the
"delivery of the goods" or the return of
the money. The date of immunity of pub
lication set forth in .the. various receipts
had expired. Wilbur was, stampeded. He
hurried, he says to Conroy's office and a
meeting was arranged in the offices' or
Daniel M. Burns. Promises of a speedy
settlement were made. The return oZ
Burns was all that stood in the way of
the settlement of the matter. An
other meeting was held In Burns' office.
Again a temporary respite was prayed by
Wilbur. A third meeting was held in the
Palace Hotel and Wilbur decided to take,
a trip to Los Angeles and lay the case
before the Governor.
The Governor could offer no suggestion
or relief and Wilbur hurried home
and promised that after the extra ses
sion, at which time it was hoped the
Governor would pass his now "celebrated"
reorganization law, positions would be
open by. the score and all would be re
membered by his Excellency or his ad
visers.
The extra session came. Still no posi
tions were forthcoming and, though ad
mitting the right of the dupes to positions,
Conroy refused to admit knowledge of
the transaction by which Wilbur's victims
relinquished ownership of golden twen
ties. McKerricher, who with his asso
ciates waited for his position or the re
turn of his money, was finally assured,
he asserts, by Mr. Bailey, a brether-ln
law of Daniel M. Burns, that if his posi
tion depended upon Conroy It w T as all
right. This relieved for a time the ten
sion of those who had been fleeced, but
finally they placed their cases In the
hands of Attorney Dam.
In a book in Burns' private vault, which
is under the control of Edward C. Conroy,
there appear the names of Perry, Fallen
and Tate. These men, notwithstanding
that they have been assured that this
means sure recognition for them, have
joined with their associates for the com
mon weal and will stand to the end In
the fight for the sold they earned by the
sweat of their brows.
No political crime in the annals of Cali
fornia politics has carried more unhappi
ness into thejjemes of toilers than have
these promises made with lying lips.

As above ntnted. I collected from JOIIX L. FERREN the sum of 940; from JOHN ISELE the turn
of $SO and two notes in the sum of $25 each; from II. A. WflST tlte sum of $5O and two notes In the
(turn of $25 each; from .1 A. MISS WOODS tlie mini of $15 and two notes in the ihuiii of $25 each; from T. J.

to me, besides the individual notes hereinbefore ntated.
I hnd npokvn to one ED COXROV in rcRard to placing? some men on the front, stating: that thej
were willing to put up some money for campaign purposes, and he readily assented on a limited ntim
hcr of carpenters, to placing these men, on the patting up of $50 each In cash and two notes for $25
each, payuiilc one and two months respectively, after their obtaining positions. I was led to believe
at nil times that tlte positions were secure and that there would be no doubt of .the truthfulness of
CON'ROY'S word concerning snid positions.
As soon as I had collected from each and every one of said persons hereinbefore named, I tnrneil
the money no collected immediately over to Mr. Conroy, -who save no receipt and had instructed
me to give no receipt to the men for said money collected, though I had given two receipts, one to
Mr. Ferren and one to .Mr. WoikIk. .Mr. Conroy. had pat me off in various ways from time to time
in plncins: the men. All sorts of excuses were offered, until I found out he was acting: in bad faith.
My object in niuklns thin amdavit is to vindicate' myself, becanse those who advanced the
money to me have demanded cither the money or the position as promised, and as I am in no posi

E. D. WILBUR, WHO SWEARS
EDWARD C. CONROY WAS
DIRECTOR OF THE - â¢
SWINDLE.
CLEVELAND DAM.
t m % Â£N men, nine of whom de-
H pend upon the labor of their
hands to support their fami
lies, have been made, according to
their declarations, the dupes of un
scrupulous political tricksters, who,
they assert, received from them
money for official places to which
they were never appointed.
The person directly accused by th.3
men is E. D. Wilbur, to whom they
claim they paid hard-earned coin and
promissory notes in return for prom
ises of places on the water front.
Wilbur makes affidavit that he paid
the money over to Edward C. Conroy,
Dan M. Burns' private secretary, end
also secretary to the Pilot Commis
sion and, in the absence of Colonel
George Stone, chairman of the Re
publican State Central Committee,
upon Mis premise that he could place
the men in positions. Conroy denies
that Wilbur gave him any mon-y,
and eays he did not authorize Wilbur
to promise any positions.
The ten men say that they paid to
Wilbur S5O cash each, with the ex
ception cf one who paid S4O, and that
each of them gave in addition two
promissory notes for $25. They
never received the places and began
angrily to demand the return of their
money. The unfortunate men declare
they have had meetings with Conroy
in Burns' office, and that he has told
them to keep quiet until the return
cf Dan Burns, when he would return
their money to them." Hestitution has
r.ever been made, the men say, and
now they openly accuse Wilbur and
Ccnrov.

in his possession the promissory notes of

the craftsmen of this city. From each of

these men he has collected various sums.

Secure a Fortune.
McPIIERSON, Kans., July 18.â Friends
of Rev. T. II. James, the Kansas minis
ter who returned from London las^ week
in a dazed condition after wandering in
England for two months, are investigat
ing the record of the Episcopal clergyman
who accompanied James across the ocean.
Another consultation of physicians has re
sulted in a reiteration of the belief that
James was drugged while on shipboard
on the way to claim his fortune, and sus
picion is directed against his companion.
James' companion represented himself as
having a church In California, but word
from the Bishop of California received to
day states that no such man is rector
there nor has been Jn years. This lends
further color to the alleged bad record of
the supposed clergyman. James remains
in an exhausted condition and his mind is
still clouded as to his movements abroad.

The leading witness to-day in the trial

dered man. â¢
Pleasant Curtwrlght, aged 61, testified
that on the morning of January 25, 1S71, he
overtook Jester on the road en route to
Paris, near the ford of the Elk River, in
charge of two wagons and teams, and was
pretty close to him before Jester knew he
was near. Jester turned and seemed very
much disturbed.
E. Wetmore testified that Jester, with
his two teams, stopped in his livery stable
of Paris the night of January 25, 1S71.
Jester slept in his wagon that night in a
barn, although he was invited to sleep in
the office, wnere there was a stove. He
appeared to be In trouble.

of Mayhem.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, July IS.â Ella Genozzi
cams to this city this afternoon in com
pany with Marshal Collins of Petaiuma
and swore out a warrant charging Sylvia
Mogestochl with tho crime oÂ£ mayhem.
The story told by Genozzi was borne out
by his personal appearance. His nose was
bitten off, as was also his upper lip, and
Ills eyes were terribly blackened. Accord
ing to his story, he and his assailant were
working on their ranch on Salmon Creek,
this county, yesterday afternoon In the
hay field. The sun being hot Genozzi was
affected by it. and when lunch time came
was unable to eat and went to the barn
for a rest.
Mogestochl came to the barn and on be
ing informed by Genozzi that he was un
able to work that afternoon, he com
menced a violent assault on the prostrate
man. Genozzi struggled to protect him
self, with the result that his assailant
bit off his nose and upper lip. Covered
with blood, the Injured man struggled to
his feet and was made the victim of a
second assault by his antagonist, who this
time used a club.
Neighbors took the injured man to Peta
iuma for medical attendance, and to
night, weak with pain and loss of blood,
he came here and had a warrant Issued
for Mogeatochl's arrest, which Constable
Treanor will endeavor to serve to-morrow.

Kthel, an actress, was charged in thÂ»

fraudulently obtaining goods by means of
worthless checks, were given a hearing

charged from custody.

DETERMINED ASSAULT OF
BOERS ON BRITISH FLANK
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PHOEXIX (Ariz.), July lS.-Harry Tha
raldsen of San Francisco and New York,
stopping here temporarily, owner of sev
eral mining claims in Mexico, received a
message thi3 evening from the manager
of a mine near Rodeo, State of Durango,
Mexico, telling of a hard fight on Monday
between a mixed force of Mexican soldiers
and fifty ranchers and a party of Yaqui
Indians. Five whites were killed and
about twenty wounded, including one offi
cer, and the Indians lost many more.
For several weeks troops have been
rounding up Indians in the lower range
of the Sierra Madre Mountains, and three
or four slight skirmishes have occurred.
The Indians were always In small force.
On Monday a party of fifty was corralled
in a pass between two hills. Two com
panies of troops advanced through a de
file and met the band of 150 reds, a large
part of which had been hidden on the
other side of the butte. After fierce fight
ing the Mexicans were driven in disorder
from the pass. Couriers sent out called
in reinforcements of cowboys and miners
and an eftort was made to surround the
entire band. The Indians resisted fiercely,
both sides fighting from behind rocks.
After a hard battle for half an hour the
Indians broke through the force in the
rear and escaped into the mountains. A
messenger sent to. the main force of Fed
eral troops returned with two more com
panies Monday night. The Indians are now
divided in small bands through the moun
tains. It is believed the party will not
again collect in force. Miners and ranch
men have abandoned work and gathered
together for better protection in case of
further trouble. , .

Cracksmen Had Their Work for Noth

Deposited in the
Bank.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAX JOSE, July IS.â The safe In the
office of the Standard Oil Company at the
corner of Sunol and San Salvador streets
was blown to pieces last night by burg
lars and the office wreckexl in an attempt
to get at the coffers of this gigantic trust.
The cracksmen, who were evidently ama
teurs, judging by their crude work, were
disappointed if they expected to get any
great amount of Rockefeller's. wealth, for
they only obtained between two and three
dollars.
The place presented a sorry sight when
Foreman J. T. Bernbaum appeared on the
Bcene this mornir.g. A lock had been pried
off the front doors of the warehouse. The
floor of the office was strewn with parts
of the safe and fire proof clay. About the
place were strewn papers and books. It is
believed dynamite or nitro glycerin was
used from the force of the explosion.
Every bit of office furniture was wrecked.
One of the outer doors of the safe had been
blown to the ceiling, knocking a hole in
It some three by five feet. The door then
dropped to the Moor ten feet away. Pieces
of the other door lay about the room. So
powerful was the explosion that the brick
building was cracked. Xo drilling had been
done and how the men operated is not
known. The loss In damage will amount
to several hundred dollars.
There is no clew to the hurglars. People
residing in the neighborhood heard an ex
plosion about 2 o'clock, but as such noises
are" common, being caused by the ex
pansion and contraction of the tanks, no
attention was paid to it. Considerable
collecting was done by the company yes
terday, and this had evidently been noted
and th2 men expected to make a big haul.
The money, however, had been placed in
a bank.

STANDARD OIL
OFFICE WRECKED
BY BURGLARS
GEORGETOWN. Ky.. July IS.â The {rial
of Caleb Powers in the Goebel assassina
tion case was resumed to-day and John
A. Black of Barbourville, a banker of that
place and a Republican, was the first
witness called. Witness said Powers told
him in January he was organizing an
armed mob to go to Frankfort. Witness
discouraged the project, but Powers in
sisted that the mob should be forwarded,
saying it would Intimidate the Legisla
ture.
"Powers told me," said the witness, "the
mob was being formed with the approval
of Governor Taylor, Charles Finiey and
other ltepublican leaders at Frankfort.
Charles ivinley also came to me and en
deavored to get me to co-operate with
them. 1 protested bitterly. Powers be
came very angry with me on account of
tno position 1 took."
A check from Charles Flnley to the
Louisville and Nashville RailFoaa for $KWU
lor transportation of the men to Frank
fort was produced by Black in response
to a question from the prosecution.
On cross-examination Black said that
Finiey claimed the mountaineers were be
ing taken to Frankfort to "influence" the
Legislature. Powers said the purpose was
to "Intimidate" the body. The witness
said he "never heard Powers make
threats against Goebel except in a general
way."
\V. H. Coulton, himself under indictment
as an accessory and supposed to be the
star witness of the prosecution, was call
ea next. The defense raised a point
against the competency of Coulton as a
witness, Jie being under Indictment and
not having been tried. The jury was ex
cluded during the argument of the point.
At, the conclusion of the argument the
court told the lawyers on both sides to
prepare their authorities on the question
involved and present them to him this
afternoon'. A recess was then taken.
In the afternoon Judge Cantrill ruled
that while at common law a particeps
crlminae could not testify against a co
conspirator so long as he himself rsniain
ed untried, that rule was abrogated under
the law of this State, and that Coulton
was a competent witness; the right to
testify being a personal privilege.
Coulton took the stand. The court in
structed the witness that he might testi
fy or not, as he might desire, and he was
not required to tell anything that would
tend to Incriminate himself, but could re
fuse to answer such questions. He replied
that he would testify of his own free will.
Coulton said he knew all the persons in
dicted as accessories to the Goebel mur
der. Witness said he attended a confer
ence at Frankfort in January at which
Powers and others were present and that
the matter of bringing mountain men to
the capital was being discussed.
Hamp Howard, Frank Cecil and other
mountain men were there and were ask
ed by Powers how many men they could
bring from Harlan. Bell and other coun
ties. They promised to bring crowds rang
ing from fifty to 200 men from each of
the counties represented. Those in the
meeting were to take charge of the men
in their respective counties and bring
them to Frankfort armed. Powers said
that when the men arrived at Frankfort
they would give the Democratic legisla
tors thirty minutes In which to settle
the contests, and "if they <lic!n't settle
them in that time they would kill every
d d one of tl-em "
Coulton continued: "The mountain men
arrived In Frankfort January 25. They
numbered from 1000 to ll'OO men. Those
who carried guns had them stacked in the
office of the Commissioner of Agriculture,
and each man was given a tag corre
sponding with a number on hip gun. Cap
tain Bullock, afterward connected with
the "Williamsbure military company, had
charge of this. After holding the meet
ing in the Statehouse the bigger part
of the crowd was sent home."
Declared That Unless the Goebel Con
test Were Quickly Settled All the
I*egislators*Would Bo
Shot.
Armed a Force for the Pur
pose of Intimidating the
Legislature.

comes the hacking, lingering cough, and
the doctor looks serious and talks of pine

That is the time when Dr. Pierce's

value. It has cured hundreds of cases of
" weak lungs," obstinate, lingering cough,
bronchitis, spitting of blood, and other
forms of disease, which if neglected or
unskillfully treated lead to consumption.

Mrs. F. W. Goulder. 1305 4th ave., Rock Island,
111., writes:
"I was afflicted for flve or six years with catarrhal
difficulties and was growing worse all the time. I
began taking your Peruna, with a marked improve-'
ment from the first. Independent of curing that, tho
Peruna has greatly Improved my Reneral health."
"Every bottle of Peruna is worth its weight in
gold; especially to me, for I owe my present good
health to Peruna. It has been a blessing from God to
me. For any one that Is cured of chronic catarrh or
any disease by the use of Peruna is permanently
cured, and they are string and healthy ever after.
Peruna is a household safeguard and blessing to suf-
fering humanity.- Whenever I have the opportunity I
recommend Peruna to the sick and suffering ones. I
tell them what It has done for mo and many others. I
only wish every home could have a copy of your lnval-
ua&le books, especially 'Health and Beauty.' Every
woman should have one." Mrs. F. W. Goulder.
Mrs. Hannah Llnd. 11S2 E. Long St.. Columbus, O..
is one of the many enthusiastic advocates of Peruna.
She says: "For many years I was subject to nervous-
ness, despondency and neuralgia, for which doctors
end remedies seemed of no use. At last I was per-
suaded to try Pemr.a. I found it to be exactly the
remedy I have eo long been in search of. Peru na re-
lieves the tired, depressed fee/ing at once. It
never fails io restore to me natural appetite
and the best of sleep, it has cured permanently my
old neuralgia and despondency, and I wonder why so
manv people continue to suffer from nervous depres-
sion "when Peruna is such a prompt and perfect roller.
As a family medicine I believe Peruna to have no
eaual It relieves at once 'cramps, colic, prostration
from heat, the 111 effects of sudden checking of per-
epiration and all other bad effects of hot weather. As
a remedy for nervous prostration it has no equal, and
the thousands of men and women of this generation

A TELL TALE
After .William TeU had shot the apple
from the head of Tell Jr., he was urged to
A REPUBLICAN RESPONSIBILITY
UPON the Republican party rests the responsibil
ity of defeating the schemes of the railroad
managers and the ward bosses of San Fran
cisco to control the next Legislature and through it
fix the Assembly. Senatorial and Congressional dis
tricts for the coming ten years. The responsibility is
imposed upon Republicans because it is everywhere
admitted that this is a Republican year in California,
as in the Union, and that about all the Democrats
can hope to do is to held their organization together.
The rearrangement of the districts under the new cen
sus will be done in the name of Republicanism. Shall
it be done by honest Republicans, or by men who
wear the party badges and train in its ranks only for
the sake of the spoils of politics?
The combination formed among the bosses of both
parties in this city, and backed by all the resources of
the unscrupulous managers of the Southern Pacific
road, is a formidable one. It can be defeated by the
better element of the Republican party provided that
element be aroused and energetic. It cannot be de
feated by a half-hearted spirit, or by weak and unor
ganized action. There is needed at this juncture the
exercise of the full strength of loyal Republicans, and
that need is especially felt in this city, for the danger
point is here.
It should not be overlooked that for the purposes
of the railroad and the bosses it will not matter much
whether a Republican or a Democrat be elected so
long as he will serve the schemers. Kelly and Crim
mins. therefore, would be quite willing to plan and
plot a defeat of Republican candidates if it be made
to their advantage to do so by the railroad. Such
being the case, it would be folly on the part of the
Republicans to put any trust in them, or to permit
them to exert any influence in making nominations.
Clean politics is the best way to win a clean victory.
Compromise with the saloon gangs and bosses- will
compromise everything.
The time for earnest Republicans to begin-organ
izing for victory is now. Among professional men,
business men and workingmen the questions of the
day should be. Have you registered? Have you en
rolled in a Republican club? Every loyal Republican
should by such -inquiries help to bring his friends into
active work for the party and for the cause of good
government. t
As The Call has repeatedly pointed out, registra-
The yellow kid is to be congratulated. The Call
is seldom pleased to be in his company, but in an
nffair such as the probate crime, which The Call ex

of a public crusade. The yellow sheet cannot do
much, but by its attention to the grave scandal which

kept out of mischief.
SOME GERMAN STATISTICS.
SLOW as we nave been in the past in the work of
tabulating and publishing the results of census
taking, the Germans can give us no points.
Our census taken in 1S90 was not fully revealed to
us for many a year thereafter, but the salient facts
concerning indus-try and commerce we did manage tc
get within a year or two. In Germany, however, they
have but recently begun the publication of trade
Late as are these figures, some of them arc of in
terest to the general .public as well as to special stu
dents of trade statistics or of German industry, and
unions the more interesting are those which show
the extent to which the consolidation of indusfies
was carried 0:1 in Germany during the period covered
by the census. A summary of the returns in that re
spect says: "Since 1882, the <!ate of the last census,
the number of persons engaged in gainful occupa
tions increased 30.9 per cent, while the number of
cstablislunents increased only 4.6 per cent. Estab
lishments are divided into three groups, according
to the number of employes â the small ones with five
or less persons, the medium establishments with be
t've-eu six and fifty, and the large ones with more than
fifty. While the small establishments increased but
38 per cent in number and 10 per cent in the size of
t'ieir personnel, the medium ones increased 69.7 per
*ent. and 76.3 paÂ»- cent respectively, and the iarge
ones go per cent in number and 83.- per cent in sire of
personnel."
It is stated that the results shown have been due
solely to the natural operation of economic law, and
rot to the organization of trusts. Germany has sÂ»Â«
herself to the task of competinR with Great Britain
a::d the United State* for foreign commerce, and in
< : o:riR so has been compelled to adopt the most eco
nomic methods of m.-inufacti:ring. T!ie ymall and
ill-equipped factory carmot compete with the big fac
tnry. and ?o it is abindor.ed for the lartrer one. A
pond many of the effects which \vr attribute in thi*
cotmtry to the aggresMvrr.ess of trusts are. undoubt
edly <\ur to the same causes which have been so potent
in Germany, and therefore those who denounce *il
*-orts of industrial combinations as trusts are as fonl
i^h as they are blatant. We shall learn by the census
now being taken how far industrial consolidation hr.s
been carried in the United States during the past dec
ade. The showing will doubtless prove an extensive
ron^o'irirtiort. but it is safe to say it will not equal
that reported from Germany.

MAPPING THE SOIL
THE Agricultural Department is about to i-sue a
work that is of the highest importance to agri
cultaicl It is i survey of the soils of many lo
calities in the country. The soils are mapped, so as
to present graphically their characteristics which de-
Urmine the degree of their fertility. The presence of
a;;;::h> and other mineral salts is r.oted. and the effect
o: irrigation on some soils, which finally come to
bhow alkali in such quantity as to make them bar
ren, is exhibited.
Mr. Milton Whitney, the chief of the division of
boils in the department, is desirous of extending this
survey until the character of the soils of the whole
country will be at least as well known as its geology
and geography. His assistant, Mr. Thomas H.
Mean?, has just completed a soil survey of 400 square
r-iles, or 256.000 acres, in California, taking in nearly
il of the irrigated lan-1 around Fresno. Mr. Whitney
Â«i'" be :r. California ::i a few days to inspect this sur
\r Â¦) and map out more work here.
The extension of this survey of our soils depend-;
Â¦pon the supplying of means to perfect it and publish
(he results: It is for Congress to do this, and our peo
ple should be mindful of their duty in urging the re
quired liberality.
HOT TIMES IN KANSAS.
DOWN in Kansas, where. things are still bleed
ing, notwithstanding the woolly horse has
long since given place to the wild colt all wool
and a yard wide, they cannot content themselves witii
papers that are warm on one side only, and accord
ingly, to supply a long-felt want in the community,
there has been established a "magazine" that is; red
hot on both sides and still heating with the heats of
the campaign.
The magazine is called "Pro and Con." In a re
cent issue it said: "Our readers will bear in mind
that when this journal made its appearance it was an
nounced that it departed from the common rule and
boasted a Republican as well as a Populist editor.
Mr. Goss will serve the saviors of the country â the
Populists â while the G. O. P. end will be toted by
Mr. Ball." The number now before us fully justi
fies the boast of a double set of cooks, for it roasts
both sides of everything it touches.
For example, we are told in one column of a stal
wart citizen of the Pcpulist persuasion that, "being
awakened to his country's needs by the appearance in
the arena of John Briedenthal and J. M. Jackson, he
bent his pruning-hodk into a machete, buckled on
the breastplate of righteousness, and now, at the age
of seventy-six, when he is entitled to rest, he is doing
valiant service for his country in her time 'of need."
In another column, defending a Republican delegate
to the Philadelphia convention from a charge that he
"took with him sixteen new suits of clothes and
changed four times a day," the paper says: "The
fact is that Mr. Burton carried with him an extra
suit, a clean shirt and a change of underwear. Of
course even this is hard for a Democrat to under
stand â one of the fellows who wears a shirt until it
smells like a horse blanket and changes underwear at
the biannual bath. There is an adage that cleanli
ness is next to godliness, and it takes both to make a
Republican."
It appears from these statements that down in
Kansas when making ready for a political campaign
a Populist buckles on a breastplate of righteousness,
while a Republican changes his underwear and puts
on a clean shirt. Both customs are good, and taken
together serve to refute the prevailing impression that
Kansas men are clothed only in their own wool and
bathe only in their own bleeding.
There are other notable things in Pro and Con.
On one page it is asserted: '"In the nomination of
McKinley and Roosevelt the Republican party offers
the country a magnificent national ticket. A com
bination of ability, strength, character and sturdy
American manhoodâ a perfect pair." On another
page there is a description of the Republican conven
tion at Philadelphia, in the course of which it is said:
"Empress Hanna, with an oceanic smile on his cuboid
imitation of the human face, announced that he had
connected himself with the Enfant Me at Washing
ton, Pabst and Blatz-at Milwaukee, the warehouses at
Peoria, the wineries (if California, the champagneries
of France and the revenues of Cuba. This announce
ment was greeted with grunts of approval, for it was
prophetic of prosperity."
One editor tries to rally the Prohibitionists of Kan
sas to the support of Bryan by taking up the army
canteen question and referring to McKinley as the
"Enfant Me of Canton, Ohio, and the canteen of
America," while on the very next page it is asserted:
"The suggestion on the part of the Prohibitionists
that they might give Bryan a million votes because
of the existence of the army canteen is the most child
ish piece of poppycock of the decade."
Upon one point the magazine stands with both feet.
or rather four feet, and Pro is so Con and Con is so
Pro the reader cannot tell which is the Balling and
which the Gossing. That point, if we may judge
from the statements made, is not only, a very small
but a very slippery one, for it is the character of a
contemporary who it appears has rebuked Pro and
Con. One editor speaks of that rash contemporary
as "one who contaminates all he touches and never
pays ?.n honest debt, who robs the home of its chas
tity and flaunts his loathsome pile of putrid hide and
guts on the street and among the friends of his vic
tim"; while the other" refers to him as an intellectual
malformity, whose thin mentality has gone up in
cigarette smoke, and advises his fellow citizens to take
him out, lay him over a log and let a buck nigger
swat him with a barrel stave.
In conclusion it is but fair to Kansas to say that her
conditions are excellent, and the Republican editor
bears witness to her prosperity. He says: "This
prosperity has a political significance. For all the
world knows that an element which thrives and fat
tens on blue devils and adversity cannot long survive
in such a land. The beautiful rains which mean death to
the chinch bug mean good wheat and big corn; and
good wheat and big corn mean, extermination of the
Populist, and the extermination of the Populist means
no fusion, and no fusion makes Republican success.
And all the world admires Republican success. O,
brother, this is a good year." .
With that sentiment we may as well conclude this
review. I-et the Populist brother be reasonable and
recognize that conditions which exterminate him
make a good year, and let him rejoice therefor.
Furthermore, let us hope that in the general improve
ment that is going on there will be an improvement
also in the Kansas contemporaries of Pro and Con.
John M. Chretien is seeking to palliate his crime
by insisting that he is not the only rascal who has
picked dead men's bones in the courts of San Fran
cisco. He should possess himself in patience; there
is excellent promise that his pals will join him behind
the bars.
BAMBOO FLOGGING.
To begin with, there Is the whipping and scourging with
bamboo rods. This is so common a method of "prepar<n B a
victim for trial that it is hardly considered punishment, much
le=s torture. Yet the bamboo Is laid on hard, enough to bring
blood at each stroke, and. especially when it Is applied to the
soles of the ff-et, the victim often faints from pain and loss of
blood combined. One can hardly enter a Chinese court of
"justice" without witnessing a flogging.
THE WOODEN COLLAB.
The mildest punishment that is known to the simple and
kindly official Chinese soul is the cage or Cangue. Its principle
Is that of all Chinese punishmentsâ slow torture. A Chinaman
would take no artistic pleasure in anything that killed quickly
or that reached its culmination of pain quickly. His victim
must suffer a little more each hour. In that way he makes his
delight last long and can keep a whole string of wretches to
charm him by their slow dying for months. If he killed them
at once his fun would be over too soon.
The Cangue. then, is formed to keep the agony of the peni
tent up for months, till madness or death ends his sufferings.
It Is a delightfully simple thlnpâ so simple that there Is noth
ing at nil terrifying about It at first. It merely is a large frame
of wood, with a collar In the middle. It weighs about fifty,
pounds, and is so made that it can be locked around a man's
neck. When It Is so locked it rests directly on the muscles of
the neck and on the bones of the shoulders, and It Is so con
structed thit It cannot be shifted even a tenth of an Inch, nor
can the weight be relieved with the hands. In addition, the col
lar has a sharp rim underneath. At first the victim does not
suffer much, except from Inconvenience. He Is turned loose as
scon as the Cangue Is locked on him, and for an hour or two
he waddles around In fair comfort. But gradually as the sharp
edge of the collar cuts deeply, into the flesh of his neck and all
his muscles are drawn more and more tense pain begins to
conquer him, and In a week the torturers have the felicity of
seeing a maddened wretch stumble and fall around blindly,
weeping and yelling with anguish. Remember, in addition,
that the Cangue is so made trfat the man in It cannot feed
himself or drink, and must depend on others, which gives his
jailers the chance to p.dd the torture of hunger and thirst to
his other sufferings, and the extent of this "easy" punishment
may be estimated.
BAMBOO SLIVERS.
The bamboo furnishes favorite implements for Chinese lepal
tortures. Sharpened slivers of bamboo are used for countless
purposes in countless ways. Indeed. If the reader will imagine
just what' he would hate most to have done to him with a bam
boo sliver he will hit something that the Chinese are sure to
do. The most simple and merciful deeds are to stick tiny
slivers all over their victims and to leave them there to fester.
Worse still is the cheerful practice of driving wedge-shaped
pieces of bamboo under the finger or toe nails of accused per
sons. This Is done gently and slowly with a mallet, and the
hammering is kept up until the victim confesses or the judges
decide that It is enough.
IMPALEMENT.
Impalement Is a popular amusement. A sharpened bamboo
stake is used for this pleasing diversion. The sufTerer Is pin
ioned and !aid .on the ground. Then the executioner either
drives the stake through him as an insect would be impaled
on a pin, carefully avoiding any immediate mortal injury, or
the stake Is forced along the whole length of the body, provid
ing a death somewhat more swift but even more hideous to
contemplate. In one unspeakable form of impalement the yel-
low wretches do not carry It far enough to kill the victim at
once, but stop just so that he will live in Incredible agrony for
days and days and sometimes even weeks, during 1 which time
he is placed on public exhibition.
CRUCIFIXION.
Crucifixion Is a common form of punishment, but usually
it is onry a mere accompanying detail of other tortures. Thus
a man may be crucified and left in the sun to die from thirst.
Or he mny be nailed to a cross with his head shaved and cov
ered with sweet syrup to attract insects that will bite him to
death after days of suffering 1 .
Of all punishments that involve crucifixion, however, the
one that delights the official Chinese heart the most Is Llng-
C'hoe. Unp-Chee Is such a brilliant result of Ingenious thought
that th^ executioners rarely nail a man who Is to suffer this
form of punishment to the cross. They fear the pain from
that might interfere with his enjoyment of the real perform
ance, which is nothinp less than slicing him to death with dia
bolical skill. Therefore the man who Is to suffer L.fng-Chee
generally Is bound to the cross. Then there arrives the execu
tioner. An executioner skillful at IJng-ChÂ«e is viewed with
high respect in the empire, much as a successful bull fighter
Is viewed in Spain. To bungle in Uns-Chee and to slice so
much from the victim early in the game that he faints, or,
worse still, dies before he has suffered all the slicing that has
been decreed, would blacken the executioner's name forever,
and might even make him the next subject for Ling-Chee.
EXECUTION BY SLICING
The executioner is received with a little murmur of appro
bation, for his record Is as well kept in mind as Is the record
of an athlete In America or England. He bews to thÂ» high
dttmltarle? and then takes one of his swords from the aword
carrier. who has followed him. They are wonderful swords
that are used by the Llng-Chee executioners. Sometimes they
are hundreds of years old and have records so long and bloody
that a person with nÂ»rves might well shudder to touch them.
The executioner does not shudder. He knows- what depends
upon his delicacy of touch. Swiftly he swings the great weapon
around hi3 head till it whistles. Satisfied that it Is ready for
business he approaches the victim slowly. Remember that all
this time the poor wretch has been staring at the assemblage.
at the executioner, at the array of swords. He Is to be kept In
suspense still longer, for when the executioner approaches him
he does not begin at once to slice him. First he feints at him
and then withdraws. Then he makes believe apaln. Suddenly
the sword shoots In wickedly and one of the victim's eyebrows
Is sliced off eo neatly th.it it scarcely draws blood. Now begins
wonderful workâ wonderful and devilish. It may be that tha
condemned man has teen the subject of great imperial mercy.
In that case he may have been blessed beyond compare by
having his sentence commuted so that he Is to be killed In only
twenty slices, whereas hardened offenders might have been
sentenced to die only after seventy-five cuts or even more. If
the victim is very lucky, the sword will be at him so swiftly
that the eye can scarcely follow it. At each stroke some part
of the poor bound body will fall to the ground. Now it may bÂ«
a shoulder, now a piece of the breast, now an arm. Suddenly
the last cut Is made. It Is straight at the heart and the weapon
cuts It out and ends tfie suffering of the wretched man. But
the spectacle is not ended. The executioner now has to dis
member the corpse, and this he does with passes of thÂ© sword,
each carefully studied and done according to regularly laid out
rules, till there Is absolutely nothing left on the cross and only
a pile of terrible fragments lies at Its base.
When I.InR-Chee Is to be a Ions operation and the victim
is to die only after long torture the slicing Is sometimes dona
so slowly that half the day elapses before the condemned man
dies. The executioner knows just what to cut without killing,
and he rocs to work as carefully as would a surgeon. Muscles
and tendons and flesh are stripped from the body with the
razor blade of the sword until only a dreadful framework re
mains that still hns awful life In it. And at this terrible spec
tacle the Chinese gaze stolidly, without an expression either
of pleasure or loathing.
HANGING IN SNAKE PIT.
.Another Ingenious torture that Is much used Is to suspend
the condemned man with his head down In a pit. At the bot
tom are snakes, toads and all kinds of loathsome reptiles,
which writhÂ° within a few Inches of the victim's face. Hero
he Is left until the torture of the position, hunger, thirst and
reptile bites kill him.

HIPPODROMING.
I / \UR partisan processes have gone far beyond
i I ) the simple ways that characterized the earlier
I years of the government.
1 True, our politics then partook of the character of
J the government, as developed in meeting the plain
issues and few responsibilities that were upon it. The
people, with but little partisan guidance, by spon
taneous community of action fixed upon candidates
for the Presidency, selecting those who had identified
themselves with the uppermost public issues, and the
campaign was a simple affair. Each State had its
different election day. The means of communication
! were primitive, and sometimes more weeks passed
by without general knowledge of the result at the polls
than hours do now.
I With the settlement of our continental domain, and
I the appearance of the many complex and sometimes
antagonistic interests that issue from our great va
riety of industries, our party politics and processes
have emerged from their former simplicity and are
now a maze of detail, complex, and often confusing.
The "letter of acceptance" by a Presidential candi
date is a very modern method of getting before the
country an exegesis of the party platform from his
\ standpoint.
There has grown now a ponderous notification com
i mittec. one for fhe Presidential and one for the Vice
j Presidential candidate. By courtesy and recent cus
: torn the permanent and temporary chairmen of the
! national convention head these committees. Each
j must make a speech and the candidate must reply.
Mr. Bryan introduced an innovation into these post
' convention ceremonies in 1896 by going away from
his own State to be informed of his nomination. He
went to New York City, proceeding under the most
; spectacular conditions, and was notified in the pres
ence of a vast assembly in Madison-square Garden.
If was regarded as a piece of political bippodroming,
and was beli(*ed to have injured more than it aided
the prospects of the party. The oratory was florid to
i a degree, and as Mr. Bryan had unfortunately spoken
j of going East as "entering the enemy's country," the
I feeling was not cordial. This year he proposes to
i perpetuate the custom of going away from home to
: get the news of bis nomination. Indianapolis has
j been selected as the scene of the spectacle, and the
1 whole ticket will be there. It will be by no means a
I one-night stand, either. The most ponderous prepa
rations are being made. . Mr. Bryan will have his
j ceremony first. The chairman of the notification
! committee will address him and he will reply. Mr.
I Stevenson will relate the story of his sensations upon
; being nominated for the Vice Presidency, as the tail,
' trail and appendix of such a brilliant comet, which
j revolves around the central sun of hope every four
i years. Other orators will tell the particular way in
which the country is going to the devil from his point
of view, and the performance will close. The morn
ing and the evening were the first day. The curtain
will ring down, and the parched throats be unparched
in preparation for the staging of the Vice Presidential
notification.
Mr. Stevenson will be taken by surprise the second
day. He will hear of his nomination and acknowledge
the knowledge with a grateful heart in his bosom
and a lurid tongue in his head.
Then Mr: Bryan will tell how pleasant it is for him
to wag such a bnllranr tail as Mr. Stevenson, and will
tell how it thrills him from sacrum to cervix, the
entire longitude of his political spine.
Then the crop of oratory that was not ripe the day
before will be harvested, and more dangers., pitfalls,
precipices, bogs and quicksands toward which the
country is blindly rushing will be pointed out, and
thereafter the campaign will be considered wide open.
It is a queer custom, among the modern additions
tothe party ways and means, this going into another
State to be notified. It is expected to make votes in
the immediate vicinity of the ceremony, but on that
theory it should lose them where it was not.
It is a custom in line with Colonel Bryan's intense
love of display. Fond of being an object of attention,
he proposes not to waste such an opportunity in a
community where familiarity has bred that contempt
for him which prevents his carrying of his own prec
cinct, so he goes on the road and hippodromes.
tion for the primary election on August 14 closes
July 28. Registration for the general election in No
vember will not close until September 26. Every
voter who registers before July 28 will establish his
right beyond all question to participate in both the
primary and general elections. As the law requires
every voter to register anew in order to vote at the
general election in November it is advised that the
trip to the City Hall be made before July 28.
We repeat that the issue is up to the Republicans
of Sjin Francisco. The time to beat the scheme of the
bosses and the Southern Pacific touts for controlling
the next Legislature is right now. Let the duty be
attended to.

NEGLIGENCE IS
CHARGED BY THE
CORONER'S JURY
President George W. McNear of the San
Francisco Produce Exchange made a re
port yesterday at the annual meeting of
the exchange concerning the progress be
ing made toward the formation of a lew
Merchants' Exchange. Tho Bale tf the
present Merchants' Exchange property
for $sriO,0OQ to the proposed new organiza
tion was authorized some time as;o. An
option of sixty days from July 1 last was
given, so President McNear reported,
then 170 members of the Produce
Kxchangre have enrolled themselves an
subscribing members to the proposed now
body, with the proviso that at least 500
members shall be secured. Six hundred
persons who are not members of the
i'roduce Exchange were Invited to sub
scribe. One hundred have accepted the
invitation and one hundred others hav?
promised to give the matter favorable at
tention.
"Every first class city has its largo gen
eral exchange, embracing in It? membci-
Khip all the various branches of trade,"
Balu Mr. McNear. "That such exchanges
do exist Is owing to the manifest advan
tages of co-operation. To my mind no
where is there greater need of kuch an
exchange than in the city of Kan Fran
ci?co. Let us take tho initiative and bring
together the mercantile, manufacturing
and shipping interests in one grand ex
change. Do not let the opportunity slip,
but rise to the occasion and make It a
success. Then we can all congratulate
ourselves upon the formation of a true
Merchants' Exchange that with Its benefi
cent supervision will be a fitting home for
all time for all the mercantile and finan
cial interests of this city."
The president also alluded to the gains
and losses in membership in the year last
past. J. Martenstcln. H. V. Demlng, H.
Dutard and S. Sweet had died, the first
three named having been charter mem
bers. Thirteen new members had been
admitted and thirteen retired.
The treasurer had a balance of $25>S4 69,
the president said. During tho year slxtv

were purchased at $00 per phare.

a question which implied th" Juror's be
lief that Conroy had broken Curiey's skull
by striking him with a club or throwing
him out of thÂ« salnun. Conroy took oftt-nse
at the question and remarked to the Juror
threateningly, "I'll get you yet; I'll ge-e
you again," as he left the room.
After the conclusion of the Inquest Cor
oner Cole said that since he had been in
the office of Coroner, he har] been an eye
witneps on at least three occasions when
bartenders threw drunken men out of
saloons violently to the pavement.
"I have supplied myself with a police
whistle," he added, "for the purpose of
calling a policeman the next time I see
anything of the kind occur. 1 have no
doubt that manv of these cases of drunken
men with fractured skulls have originated
in just that way.!'
Coroner Cole maOe a most searchlriB
Investigation into the matter, and obtain
ed every detail from the witnesses. From
their statements it appeared that Curley
was arrested on Second street at 4:40 a. m.
July 13, by Patrolman P. Butler. He was
drunk and almost unconscious to .ill ap
pearances. On being taken to the Central
police station. Prison Keeper John Par
rott noticing his condition, refused to re-
Ceive him, and suggested to the driver of
the patrol wagon that he be taken to the
City Receiving Hospital. The driver re
tdie<l that that had been done, that Hospi
tal Steward McKenzle had stepped out to
the patrol wagon, looked at Curley and
had ordered him taken to the City Prison,
remarking at the same time that then
was nothing the matter with the man but
drunkenness.
After Curley had been in the. drunks'
roll Fevcral hours, a trusty entered and
finked him his rame. Curley was lying on
Ms hack, but answered the question by
: ayinp that his name was Michael Curley.
that he was CO years old and a machinist
by occupation.
At fc:30 o'clock the came morning Curley
Â¦was unconscious and was sent te> the Re
ceiving Hospital and when Dr. Hunnell
arrived at 30:30 he discovered symptoms
r>f bra'n pressure. The next morning he
had Curley s^nt to the City and County
Hospital, where an operation was per
formed In tlj>' afternoon. Curley died the
next morning.
Steward McTOnzie.was disciplined for
his nrgloct to examine the man when he
wns brought to the Receiving Hospital,
but Dr. Bacisr.ilupl. who was In attend
ance, was not called to Fee the patient.

xu,n, s-iUl to-night: "I fear that thert> is
but little hope now fur tho discovery of
or any trace of the disaster which we
must believe befell my brother and Mi.Â«s

day has been a bitter disappointment to
me."
A message was received from Point
Richmond to-night by Attorney Harry

generally believed the disaster must have
occurred, to I'olnt Klehmonu. tsnouia tne

one of the pair in Kelly's bout was known
to be. It will leave little doubt as to the
fate of the boat's occupants and the boat

I. ate to-night Thomas Kelly telegraphed
to Point Richmond to ask that the oar

thought to have been found. After a
careful soarch below the waters the diver
on his return to the surface announced

w<re thought by the searching party to

In* the expectation of recovering the boÂ«i

of the circumstances of the tragedy the
disappointment to all engaged in to-day s
has been bitter, and the search
J:as been practically abandoned. To-mor
row a few boats wi!l make a last effort
to locate s<>me trace of the disaster, but
beyond asking every bay and river cap

The lost catboat had been n*wly painted

THE leaders of the Democracy of
San Francisco gathered last night at
the banquet given in honor of Sena
tor John \V. Daniel of Virginia by
the Monticello Club, in the conservatory
of the Palace Hotel. The banqueters
marched in the beautifully decorated
banquet-hall at 8 o'clock, and the speech
making began at 9:30 o'clock.
The fame of the honored guest, his rare
eloquence, the renown of the other speak
ers and the elegance of the banquet made
the event a memorable one in the annals
of California Democracy.
Judge. William P. Lawlor, president of
the Monticello Club, presided. At his right
was seated Senator Daniel, and to hi9 left
sat Senator J. C. Sims, Acting Mayor
Tobin and James G. Magulre.
Judge L,awlor made a short address Of
welcome and Gavin McNab responded to
the toast, "Our Guest." The toast was
drunk standing, and three hearty cheers
were given for the honored guest. Sena
tor Daniel was introduced, and spoke as
follows:
You have conferred upon me a rare and most
distinguished henor and have given me a hap
plne?s that will gild and brighten -ait my life.
My trip to California has been one of unal
loyed p!eatur<Â». I had not intended to come
so far West, but at Kansas City I contracted
tho Western fever. I know 1 shall never re
cover from it. What Is more, I don't want to.
When 1 return and the question Is put to me,
â¢'What Impressed me most on m>' trio?" there
can be but one answer. The thing that has
made the most Impression en me la the in
finite hospitality and generosity of the people
of San Kranrlseo and of California. My re
ception has been such that 1 havÂ«- become as
Inoffensive a partisan as the worst mugwump
could wish. My Republican frl?nd9 Of Cali
fornia, -whom 1 have known in Washington.
ha >- e extended so many courtesies to me that
I have seen the Kepubllcan party in a better
lipht tf-.an I ever did before.
1 recall with some pride of nativity that it
was a Virginian that l*d the expansion move
ment that added California to the Union. There
in no constitution of any government that so
easily ndaptH itself to expanMon as the consti
tution of the United States. No party In any
country hns added so much new territory as
| has th*Â» Democratic party to the original te.rrl
' tory of the United State?. But because we have
! bÂ«-en a party of expansion it 18 well to remem
Â¦ ber that we have been a party of natural ex
pansion; that the Democratic party has fol
lowed the atflnliles of nature. It made the
t'nited States, by the acquisition of the terri
' lory of lx>uislana and the territory acquired af
1 ter the Mexican war, the most compact, har
montous material fÂ«r a great country that the
sun ever shone upon.
But because man eats at a banquet. It does
not follow that he should goree himself. UÂ«
causi he takes a drink of your Jellghtful Cali
fornia wine, it does not follow that he should
drink nolson. So it does not follow that the
nation should expand by the addition of any
thing that comes along by chanca or the hatarJ
of bttttle.
Where the Democratic party has planted the
flag It has carried the constitution and the 1m
i mortal princlitlee of the Declaration of Inde
pendence. It is unworthy of this grtrat nation,
whose mission la to educate the world In the
UiefKlnge of independence, that there xhould be
any acre of It that Is not free, or any human
soul that Is not as free aÂ« his brethren.
If you search through the principles of gov
ernment enunciated in 1776 you will flnd one
bed-rock truth. It Is that taxation and repre
sentation mim bo together. If you will pre
serve that one principle and let no more burden
be laid ui>on a |*ople except by the deliberative
voice, you will do more tor the betterment of
humanity than by the enforcement of any
other elngle principle. The one objection that
lay across my path and said: "You cannot
conscientiously vote for the retention of the
I > hlllpi>lncs > ".waÂ» that the people are not such
that they can become properly a part of our
Beir-governing people.
Thts Government cannot eo off on a career
of conquest and mak? one-half of Its people
subjects and preserve the other half tree In
any true sense. We cannot raice the Oriental
horden up to the level of American eitUenshlp.
1 know I am Hpcaklng here In a State and in
a community which has reaped as much ma
terlal wilvantaRP from expansion as any, but
the time has come when It Is nut necessary to
Bhoot, when It is not necessary to conquer.
when it is not necessary to annex a people In
order to get th*-!r traÂ«l#. We are going to gÂ«t
the trade of the Orient, not because we send
NATIONAL CLUB SIGNS
MOFFATT TO FIGHT RYAN
The next fight In this city promises to
be one that will tickle the palate3 of all
the followers of flstlc buffeilngs. The Na
tional Club has matched Tommy Pyan
and Jack Moffatt to light for a $3Oj0 purse,
both men to weigh in at the ringside
within a lCS-pound limit. September 7 Is
the date set for the battle.
Moffatt has already signed and Ryan
has agreed to artix his name to the con
tract when presented. From communica
tions already received by the National
Club managers they contemplate no ob
stacles in the way of obtaining Ryan's
signature to the agreement. The pilrse.
is handsome In size and the conditions as
to weight are In Ryan's favor.
Should these two men be brought to
gether a rattling. Interesting mill would
be on the programme. They have faced
one another before, and at that time gave
an exhibition that wan satisfactory to
ring patrons, although Ryan demonstrated
a superior ability in cleverness and ring
generalship. This fight went Its limit,
Kvan getting the decision.
Since then Moffatt has made rapid and
decided improvement as a fighter. His
performance' last Friday evening at Me
chanics' Pavilion, when he gained the de
cision over Al Xelll. has elevated him a
class in the eyes of local critics. He !b
strong, cool, cautious nnd. enduring. In
regard to Tommy Ryan's ability and won
derful cleverness there is a general agree
ment. This fight should be a heart
warmer. ' '
ovor on the launch Amy and after being
under the water almost an hour told the
searching party frankly that further ef
fort would be useless. There was no boat
there. The Amy then returned to Sari
Francisco, while the searchers, tired out
and disappointed, came to Belvedere 'to
give the disappointing news to the ex
poctant town.
The white paint in the grapnels* Is a
stubborn fact to many here, aud they give
It as their opinion that the grappling irons
did actually encounter the misfelng cat-
The Democratic party has nominated two
men of jipotles* character. One has been testÂ»d
In office and cut and has eaine.i the love and
respect of men of both parties. The other,
whom we have namM for our chiÂ»ftaln. Is on*
of the most remarkable of Americansâ a man
who would rather bÂ« rleht than be President,
and. who, I believe. Is going to be both.
Other toasts were responded to as fol
lows: "The Campaign of lPOO." Senator
J. C. Sims; "United. Stutes of America,"
James G. Maguire; "The Sage of Monti

VANCOUVER, B. ' C. July 18.â Oriental
advices to-day by steamer Empress of
India bring the news of another political
crisis in Korea, According to the Kobe
Chronicle, the Japanese Prince, Li Chun
Yo, was implicated by the confessions of

The Emperor of Korea demanded of the
Japanese Minister that Prince Li and his
father be delivered up for vengeance, but
fhe Japanese Minister declined- to accede
to this request. Then, according to the
Chronicle, Kim Young Ching, described as
the official assassin of the Korean court,

1 DETROIT (Mich.), July IS.â The biggest
Blake of the trotting season, the Mer
chants' and Manufacturers', which was
Oxotted at the Grosse Pointe track to-day,
1-was a gamely fought strupgle from the
Start until the sixth heat was finished in
the gathering twilight by Lady Geraldine,
.the winner, and Arir.ie Burns, the only
etartcrs Â¦who remained In the game. Of
the prime favorites Henry S. went lame
after appearing on the track preparatory
to the first heat; Battleslgn cut a tendon
of his left forefoot during the second heat
smd was not started. The elimination of
these fast trotters made it look like any
body's race. The time was not propor
tionately fast, the track being somewhat
Jieavy after the rains.
Twelve thousand people saw to-day's
events. Eight thousand occupied the seats
end aisles of the grand Ftand; the others
etood in the betting spaces and filled the
lawn and quarier stretch space. Approxi
mately JWUJOW is estimated to have gone
into the betting pools.
Until yesterday Lady Geraldine was
owned hy Jssac L,. <Joff. of Providence,
lihode Island. To-day it was announced
he had sold her. but the buyer and the
consideration were not divulged. The new
owr.f-r placed the bay mare In the hands
<jf Kd Oeers. the veteran driver, and Geers
drove her to the winning, thereby get
ting first and third money, amounting to
upward of $6000.
In the r.rst heat G*ers tried to drive out
of the bunch in the utreteh, but Geraldine
broke at the critical point and Battlesign
tim&hed two lengths ahead of Axtello.
lO&Cy Geraldine made a sensational win
r.ing" of the second heat, rushing past Ax
tello, who was Fecond after Battlesign's
accident. Annie Burns got her nose In
front for the first time during the third
liopt. after a brush with IW Arthur.
Geers tried another of hisÂ«spurts in the
ftretch. but Geraldine broke Just as she
was passing K'd Arthur and Burns, and
The latter won the heat.- Annie Burns also
captured the fourth heat, closely chased
In bv Geraldine. The gray mare, however.

It was not the intention of those present
this evening to discuss the candidates or,

available as a candidate.
Mention was made of Admiral Dewey

Major Melville Hayes presented the re
port of the revision committee on behalf
of the executive committee. A vice presi

ST. PA 1*1... July 15.â The programme of

Clubs called for a three days' Bes-

to-day to condense the last two days
Into one and close the session to-day. The
committee on time and place has agreed

The Incapacity of the Democratic party
brought poverty to the door of labor, distrust
to the hope of capital and despair to the homes
of the poor. Its activity is a threat to the
material prosperity of the country and Its tri
umph will be an Individual and public disaster.
To prevent this we invoke sobriety of Judg
ment and vigor of action in the coming cam
paign. .
The Republican party has ever been a
builder. Its very platform has rung with the
spirit oX progress and hope. Democracy has
ever been a destroyer. Its every platform has
groaned with the spirit of pessimism and oppo
sition. The American people will never be
lieve that the builder has become the destroyer
and the destroyer the builder.
Condition in China,
Â¦W> deplore the conditions now existing In
China, and we assure the American people
that a Republican administration will protect
all of our interests, demanding: full indemnity
for the paÂ«t and full security for the future.
As we firmly believe in America and her in-
Etltutlons, we believe that the party that shall
guide and maintain us In the great future Is
the party founded by Abraham Lincoln, sup
ported by Ulysses S. Grant and exalted by
William McKinley.
The secretary read a message from
President McKinley expressing regret at
his inability to be present, and sending
congratulation of the success of the
le.igue.
Resolutions- of regret were adopted re

Judge W. C. Raymond of Illinois moved

support of the league. The motion was

in the front rank. The greatest activity has
l-een in the Western States which in 1S96 went
for Bryan, and the league movement has as
sumed Fuch proportions as to Justify the hopes
that these States will return to the Republican
fold. In closing 1 feel it my duty to call your
attention to the unsatisfactory condition of the
finances of the league and cannot too strongly
urjre the necessity for action before adjourn
ment looking to the future financial support of
the organization.
Past President Woodmansee presented
the report of the committee on resolu
tions, which was unanimously adopted m
part as follows:
Platform Indorsed.
The National Republican League In con
vention assembled congratulates the peo
ple of the United States upon the happy
and prosperous condition of the entire
country and declares anew its allegiance
to the "principles of the Republican party
which, ably and bravely carried into ex
ecution by the national administration,
have made these conditions possible.
The resolutions indorse the platform
adopted by the National Republican Con
vention at Philadelphia, approve every ac
tion of President McKinley and declare:
The Republican party stands to-day as ever
for positive policies; for a protective tariff;
fc.r e >und money: for the control and regula
tion of combinations of capital that have a
le-gitlmate purpose and the destruction of those
that have an illegitimate purpose; for the re
tention of every inch of territory that comes
to us by honorable treaty and international
law It stands for the development of the
marvelous commercial possibility of the Orient:
for the restoration of our merchant marine,
and finally. It stands for the progress of the
Tniied States and the uplifting of mankind
throucbout the world.
As representatives of the younger element of
the Republican party we have a particular
pride in the nomination for \ ice President or
Theodore Roosevelt, whom we regard as an in
spiring and lofty type of American statesman
and soldier.

CALL HEADQUARTERS, CAMP O'-
RYAN, July 18.â Residents and visitors
crowded Pacific avenue to-night and
watched the regiment at dress parade.
The cadets went through the pretty cere
mony without a break and their efforts
were heartily applauded. When the three
battalions were lined up for the ceremony
they occupied four blocks. Captain Wil
liam C. Hopper of Company A was ap
pointed to relieve Captain William Dlxon
ol G as officer of the day. and Lieutenant
William Terr}' of G was appointed to suc
ceed Lieutenant M. McCann of R as of
ficer of the guard.
A dance was held at the Armory by the
Young Ladies' Institute and tho cadets
"tripped the light fantastic" until 10:20 p.
ru., when an unsympathetic bugler blew
tattoo as a warning to the boys to return
to camp. The Held and start officers ot
the regiment were the guests of honor at
a banquet given in their honor by the
Board of Trade of Santa Cruz. There were
many distinguished guests. Speeches of a
fellcitious nature were delivered by the
guests and their hosts.
To-morrow the Held and staff will cross
bats with the line officers of the regiment.
An exciting game is anticipated, captain
Sullivan, the handsome assistant surgeon.
Is scheduled to umpire the game. The
hospital corps will be on hand with a lit
ter to carry him oft the field if the occa
sion requires it.
Edward Kugelberg, the nine toed won
dor of the regiment, arrived In camp this
afternoon and was enthusiastically re
ceived by his company. In u speech which
ho delivered outside his temporary home
ho retold the story of losing his big toe in
a battle with the rock-rollers of Telegraph
Colonel Power endeared himself to his
regiment last night by a considerate
action and now the boys are singing his
praises to the skies. During dress parade
â¢High" Private Quinn, the comedian ot
Company H. occupied a seat in the grand
stand, and as the stars and stripes were
lowered he raised his voice in song. Need
less to say Quinn was thrown into tho
guard tent and , the rumor lloated round
that he would be sent home the following
morning. When his comrades heard this
they were indignant. They had a high
opinion of Quinn and threatened to go on
a strike. During supper they cheered for
himand afterward went In a body to the
guard house and gave him an ovation.
Wiser counsel prevailed and a striko was
averted. A petition was prepared and
every officer and non-commissioned officer
and private was ready to affix his name
to the paper, which was an appeal to the
commander to reconsider his determin
ation to disgrace Quinn. A committee
waited on the colonel and the latter noti
fied it that he had. not said he would send
Quinn home, but was sorry to see him
act as he did. Quinn apologized and when
the news spread that he was to remain in
camp the colonel and the offending private
were cheered Incessantly.
Captain Hopper, assisted by the mem
bers of Company A, entertained a large
number of ladles in their street last night.
A platform was built for the occasion and
the piano placed on It. Decorations con
sisted of bunting and gay colored lanterns
and the effect was very pretty. Captain
Hopper acted as master of ceremonies and
Eddy Moore as stage manager. The fol
lowing programme was rendered:
Rag-time selections by S. Yale; over
ture, "Spagettie Band," Joe Sullivan, Tom
Smith, John Wilson and Father Kennedy;
coon selections, Edward Moore; piano solo
(original composition), Achllle Artigues;
vocal solo, "The Blue and . the Gray.'

"MacocronlBand;" barytone solo, Charles

"Tommy Atkins," by Jack McEnerney;
finale by Company A.
The hospital corps Is doing efficient
work. A sign marked with a skull and
cross bones and labeled "Chamber of
Horrore" and pinned to the tent, has a
depressing effect on the cadets in the im
mediate vicinity. Thomas. O'Dea and
Drossel are the demons In that tent. On
their right is the quarters of Kirk and
Eustace and on their tent f.ap is a-slpn of
a coffin and on it printed. "Your Finish;
Welcome."

OLD ENGLISH OAK BUFFET
(Fifteenth Century.)
clearly the strong family relationship.
From this stage to the sideboard of Wil
liam III there is but a slight step, al
though after the middle of the eighteenth
century this piece of furniture went
through many transitions. It was a com
paratively insignificant, furnishing in the
days when symmetrical doors or false
doors corresponding with those used for
rxlt were In fashion: for this style furn
ished our forefathers with good cupboards
in which to store glass, china and reserve
wines. When these extra doors with their
Inclosed cupboards disappeared. the
"stately sideboard" of which Milton sang
was superseded by the mahogany side
table, flanked on each side by pedestal
cupboards for wine or hot water. In time
these pedestals were surmounted by urn
shaped mahogany vases (now the despair
of the curio hunter) containing hot water
for washing the limited supply of silver
and iced water for the guests. In order to
maintain a happy sense of proportion,
balancing the propinquity of the separate
cupboards, the cellaret, or tub shaped ma
hoear.v wine care, was placed on casters
and rolled underneath the table. At the
back of every serving table were
curiously .han/lsome knife and spoon
cases, supported by a bras3 rail,
with uprights for candelabra. From
this multiplicity of separate serving
adjuncts evolved our modern sideboard,
which is simply a grand combination of
them all. The separate wine cooler, which

NEWS FROM THE
OCEAN AND THE
WATER FRONT
To Spain, as to the other countries nf
Europe, the renaissance gave new artistic*
Ideals, and thither were imported manv
of the artists of ItaV and the Low Coun
tries. Italian taste: and Moorish design
brought about most brilliant results In
wood sculpture, which may be studied in
old Spanish cabinet? of the sixteenth cen
tury. Many of these were decorated out
side with iron work and Inside with col
umns of bone painted and gilt and some
times inlaid with silver. A wooden coffer
made a century later shows an entirrty
unique design resulting from Saraeenio
influence. Instead of the usual ornamen
tations relating to the famous Spanish
bull-fights, this chest has a plain exterior
sparingly decorated with metal-work and
with a hinged falling front. The decora
tion of the interior, whimsical and a trirta
gaudy, is nevertheless very beautiful and
unusual, for within are quaint arches
blue and vermilion, inlaid with ivoryâ a
portion of the Alhambra In miniature, as
charming as it is rich and effective.
In Ensrland these chests seemed to serve
their original purpose of â¢â¢boxes" ratht-r
than as pieces of decorative furnishing.
In the Interesting collection in the South
Kensington Museum there is one example
of such ornamentation, but it la resnrdc.l
rather as a curio of the early seventeenth
century than a type cf the Jacobean or
Elizabethan furnishing'. The chest in of
carved oak. with a center panel represent
ing the adoration of the magi. After Wil
liam III imported Dutch craftsmen into
hi3 household it was but natural that
English carving- should show so plainly
the influence of Flemish design that it
was frequently impossible to distinguish,
it from Flemish. We have therefore no
distinctive example of old English chests
unless we except the beautiful carved oak
chest after Holbein shown in the Illustra
tion. Among the curious examples of In
dian workmanship presented to Queen
Victoria is a casket of red lacquer. Thia
coating is so put on over the wood that
the plain parts tako. a remarkably high,
polish, in striking contrast to the dullness
of the carved enrichment. Th* effect la
that of a die pressed upon red sealing
wax.
All renaissance art wast distinguished by
a free treatment of the classic antique
as opposed to the general use of sarreel
subjects during the middle ages. This
showed itself in the popular use of tl?fÂ»
mythological subjects which d^coratdi
the handsomest chesrs. A typical one la
shown in the illustration, with corners
half human, half foliated, caryatides witn
claw feet to raise them from the floor.
.Many of the first masters of the renais
sance were pleased to exercise their skill
upon these household furnishinca. Work
ers in metal like the incomparable Cellini
took dHiRht in exercising their talents
upon devices for chests; and artists in oil
painted exquisite panels upon thp gilded
"cassoni" coveted by tho Italian aristoc
racy.
Equally curious is tho ornamentation of
the chest made a century earlier. Here
tht; highly artistic effect is gained by
mtana of oval plaques of figures and coat'j
of arms of carved ivory, which are mo^t.
tnpeniously let into the surface ot tho
exterior.
Metal mountings!, used at first aa mor*
strengthened of treasure chests, fcecamw
highly ornamented, and during- the six
teenth century rrachod an unsurpassed
point of excellence. The complicated lock*
of the'"colTre fort." precursor of the burs
lar-proof safe, show also the Ingenuity
of the renaissance metal workers. ThtÂ»
d?coration~~of this chest is must interest
ing, being an imitatkm of damascening, by
means of a strong acid which has bitten
the design into the woodwork.

Warrant Out for the Arrest of Hazel
Neuman on a Charge of
Battery.
The Soclety> toy the "Prevention of Cruel
ty to Children was notified yesterday
morning by Mrs. Mary Black. 429 First
street, of a case of cruelty that stagpered
the officials. She told them that Hazel
Neuman, a girl 17 years, of age, had been
beating her sister Violet, 10 years of age,
with a broomstick and trunk strap until
tho girl was covered from head to feet
with black and blue bruises. Violet had
come to her house Tuesday night for pro
tection from her sister.
The family lives at 673 Harrison street
and the parents left with some friends on
a camping out excursion about a week
ago, leaving the two girls to look after the
house. Soon after the departure of the
parents Hazel began to chastise her sister
on the slightest provocation, using alter
nately the broomstick and the strap. She
kept her locked In the house, but Tuesday
night Violet made her escape and took
refuge with Mrs. BlacX.

Captain Weiss of the Belgian King has
this to say about the accident:
Soon after passing the lightship we ran into
a dense tog. We were going along under easy
steam when I heard two whistles and answered
them. Then I heard two whistles again and
ncnirt answered, putting my helm over accord
ingly. The next thing I knew thÂ« Tellus was
t/lir.ost on top of m<?, fo I blew three whistles
and went full speed astern. It was too late,
however, and we crashed Into her port quar
ter. Tho crew of the Tellus thought she was
Koingr down, so they came aboard my ship.
Luckily the collision bulkheads on the Tellu3
held and she was afloat and in fair shape at
daybreak. The crew went hark aboard her
and we took her in tow and made port. My
vessel Is leaking slightly, but the Tellus is
badly damaged.
The Belgian King and her tow made
port late last night and anchored off the
Presidio. There is an onormous hole In
the port sirfi* of the Tellus, but the Bel
gian King shows no signs of the collision.
Both vessels will be discharged and
docked for repairs.
Belgian King, under charter to the United
States Government to load supplies at I
Seattle for Manila, left port. Soon after
pacing out through the Golden Gate a
dense fog set in and the Belgian King
went north under a slow bell after the
pilot left her. off Point Arena the whistle
of another steamer was heard. Signals
went back and forth through the fog and
both steamers were going full speed
astern when the collision took place. |
The Belgian King is not very badly dam- j
aged. She struck the Tellus fair and
pquare on the port quarter. The force of I
thf impact started pome plates on her
Ftarboard bow. while on the port side (
something went below the water line. !

with checkers. Again. If the habitation
possessed a dining table the meal was
spread in front of the long box. which
now served as a bench for several mem
bers of the household. After the table
was removed the chest was still In evi
dence, as an extempore couch, as a back
for those sitting on the floor and as a.
very uncomfortable prototype of the
carved seventeenth century settle. By de
crees back and arms were added to the
chest, and thus transformed ft became
the chief furnishing of the living room.
As soon as comfort entered into the con
sideration of the coffermakers the settle
shared the general dispensation, and as
early as the latter part of the fifteenth
century we find a most solid form of com
fort in the carved oak seat, the most
striking feature of which Is the movable
back rest, so disposed that the leaping
flames on the hearth may be viewed with
satisfaction. Soon a 'canopy, or protecting
hood, to keep out draughts and the in
clemency of the weather was added to
the chest on the dais where sat the heads
of the house: and this place of honor, by a
few swift modifications, was transformed
into a thronelike seat, which In due time
developed, as material and skill became
more abundant, into the ordinary chair of
to-day.
By raising it on legs and adding a back
the chest unfolded still more protean pos
sibilities. It then became a dressing cabi
net, as shown in the Illustration, or a
"dressolr" upon whose shelves were dis
played the famtly plate â the progenitor of
the modern sideboard. A comparison of

tury buffetâ a box on legs, with hinged
doors instead of lidâ brings out more

THERE was a narrow escape from
another ocean tragedy late Tues
day night. Two steamers came to
gether off. Point Arena and the
crew of onÂ© of them took to the
boats, thinking their craft was sinking,
luckily the collision bulkheads held, and
early yesterday morning the crew went
aboard the derelict and made steam on
the boilers again. She finally reached San
Francisco in tow of the vessel that ran
her down.

"When looking over our modern tables,

boards it is difficult to realize that they
are all offshoots of a common ancestorâ
the chest. In the nomadic days of the
race these plenishings of a tent or shed
were constructed solely with a view to
their strength and portability. During the
Anglo-Saxon and Norman days they were
the repositories of the family penates,
clothing and treasure, and, rudely deco
rated with strap and metal work, were
fastened on horses or mules and thus
transported to domiciles new.
When the primitive bedstead was but a
shelf on the wall or a rough board table

forefathers stormed the rugged heights of

California sole leather has been de
clared by the War Department officials
at Washington to be of superior quality.
The order forbidding its use in the manu
facture of shoes for the United States
army has been rescinded. Closely fol
lowing this action the Government has
contracted with Cahn, NIckelsburg & Co.
and Buckingham & Hecht of this city for
the manufacture of 75,000 pairs of army
shoes at once, California sole leather to be
used therein.
The order was received yesterday. The
shoe manufacturers and the tanners were
naturally much pleased. Some time ago
Quartermaster General Ludington ob
jected to California sole leather. An in
vestigation into the merits of the article
was promptly advocated by the Manufac
turers' and Producers' Association, by
California tanners, â¢ by Cahn, Nickels
burg & Co.. and by Buckingham &
Hecnt. Senator Perkins and Con
gressmen Loud and Kahn co-operated
at Washington, upon learning the fact?,
in an effort to havo the orders that dis
criminated against the California product
revoked. The Californians were strength
ened in their position by the voluntary tes
timony of leading shoe manufacturers !n
the East that the California sole leather
was a superior article.
Nothing has been lost by the local
leather men. The authorities, when the
facts were fully presented, acted prompt
ly and no business has been diverted from
this State. This was found to be another
reason for satisfaction among shoe manu
facturers and tanners yesterday. The
leading journal of the leather trade, the
Shoe und Leather Reporter, published in
New York, recently commented editorial
ly, under the head of "Discrimination
Against California Leather," in part as
follows:
"There have frequently been conditions
In the specifications of Government con
tracts for shoes and leather that are un
accountable to ordinary mortals. A con
splcuous instance of this kind is the re
striction placed upon the manufacturers
of shoes in San Francisco in the recent
bids for army supplies. They are pro
hibited from uslnp sole leather made In
California in the bottoms of the shoes. No
condition of this kind is laid upon Eastern
manufacturers. The manufacturers of the
Pacific Const are thus heavily handi
capped. This discrimination against cer
tain sections of our country, regardless of
the leather tanned, is unnecessary and un
just, and should not be permitted by the
Government, authorities, as it is evident
that unless the regulation was stupidly
made it is the intention to favor certain
tanners at the expense of others. Very
creditable leather is now being turned out
on the Pacific Coast, which is fully equal,
so competent jiidpes say. to that made In
any other part of the country. It is used
to a large extent by many shoe manufac
turers east of the Rocky Mountains."

l^eed Proper Food to Supply the Brain.
The "Medical Sentinel' 1 comments on
the restless brain worker of our large
cities and refers to the fact that he
thinks he knows as much about the
needs of the brain, when he is tired and
shows brain fag, as a trained prac-
titioner.
He is inclined to spur up the tired
organs by some stimulant or perhaps
quiet its complaints with the narcotic of
tobacco, and this plan goes on until
suddenly he collapses, for brain fag is
a sure sign that the elements that com-
pose the brain are being more rapidly
used up than replaced by the food.
f There is really a choice of but two
j athwayg for an active brain worker â a
man of affairs â when he shows symp-
toms of breaking down. Either he must
quit work or he must have food that will
replace she structure of brain and nerve
centers as rapidly as they are used up
each day.
Chemical analysis of the particles
thrown out throuph the pores of the
body shows that after continued brain
work a lar^e portion of excreta contains
phosphate of potash. It is known thai
when this element is furnished by the
food in p r Â°P cr quantities the system
unites it with albumen and from that
compound makes the gray matter that
fi]!s the nerve centers and the brain.
This is an especial feature of the food
known as Grape-Nuts, a delicious,
ready-cooked, and predigested break-
A definite and well understood gain in
brain power and physical strength will
tet in after Grape-N'uts have been used
cifrht or ten day?, and sustained and
continued brain work can be carried on
if a reliance is placed upon this food in
connection with the ordinary food of
thjday.

class groceries.

BOSTON July IS.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow: There
has been a little more looking around for wool
and consumers generally may be said to have
manifested more Interest In the market, which
fact combined with the decided Jlrmnesa
shown at the London sales, where the decline
in prices recorded at the opening have been
substantially recovered, has tended to Impart
a more cheerfut feeling in the wool market.
There is as yet no material increase to t>Â» noted
In the volume of business transacted, however,
whlc.1 Ftill remains of very small proportions.
The s.iles of the week In Boston amounted to
1 313 000 pounds domestic and 320.000 pounds for
e'tRTi makinct a total of 1.663.000, against a to
tal of 3 316.000 for the previous week and a to
tal of 1O.16J.S0O for the corresponding week last
year The stiles since January amount to 71,
837,000 pounds, against 14'J,77C,0OO pounds for the
corresponding; time last year.

"Values have shown a decided disposition

which appear* to demonstrate the inherent
Ftrength of lhe t'enera! situation. The rÂ«ad-
Ju:-i:;er.t in genera! business lines has lately
been viewed ir. a. rctlier t^/o pessimistic way
by :i:ary people. The enormous demand of
the last two jears Inevitably resulted in an
overvroducUcn, which must await gradual con
sumption, hence the ehading in prices and
the slacking off ir. sales, tut the fact remains
that The ereat mass of the people are upon
a larfecr Income basis. Wage scales still rule
materially higher than for many previous
rears, ami bence a \.-ry large purchasing pow

fact alone fhoull be enough to confound th*
alarmists'. More farorabie weather conditions

have caused a more hopeful feeling an-1 bid

Nczp i ork Stock Market.
SEW TORK. July lS.-The bulls partly Je
elrted from their effort* to advance prices t .
day and the recent appearance of activity due
to their oj>eratior.Â« promptly gave place again
to nomething near to stagnation. While the
pTOHRin U) realiz<Â» was not severe it was evi
dent that the recent demonstrative buying by
the bull party has failed utterly to attract
any demand frnrn outside sources 50 that no
market Â»s offered for taking of profits. It ifc
not difficult to foretell what would be tne
effect und'-r these eircurr.Ftanrrs of the selling
out of recent speculative purposes. Appar
ently the principal reason for the ceasing" of
bull manipulation wan the demonstrated futil
ity of the attempt to attract outside buyln*.
Predictions of dividend action en Baltimore
end Ohio are fo far discredited that that
ptock went backward to-day and even Union
Pacific, which tisn been advanced by much
more aggressive management, fell hack almost
ee much, the latter losing IVi net and the
former l*g. The increase in the dividend rate
of Illinois Central apparently did not add to
th-> credence given to the predictions of other
dlvi^iPini incr^'fltePS. Y**?t *?r<33. v' s violent ri sc of
4 potnta In I'acific Mail and the strength of
the Pacific railroad stocks was more fully
rxplalned by to-day's detailed reports of the
chartering <>f steamships In the Pacific by the
United States Government and in the Atlantic
by tile Grrniaii Government for use in the
Pacific to transport military supplies to China.
lJut the Inviting prospect thus offered of lucra
tive traffic far the transcontinental railroad
lln^s was offset to-day by some other con
sidetatlor!? <if the result to accrue from the
war In China. Wall street has not given
much attention hitherto to the check in ex
port trade in textiles caused by the ur.sntl-*
m*nt in China. The uneasiness caused abroad
l>y reports <â¢? Boxer inroads upon Russian ter
rltory brought tales of securities in New York
for foreign account an<i a reminder that force.l
liquidation abroad rr.isht throw eoreideraUe
bunlens ui>on the New York stock market. The
day's shipments of gold were a reflection of
the money needs "f foreign markets, which
are not unlikely to grow acute if the Gov
ernment expenditures for war should become
large. To-('.ay's engagement, amounting to
J2.Â«:i").CW>. was* more than ft million less th.-iii
anticipated. A further sharp advance in sterl
ing exchange at Peris, a reduction in the Bank
of England's price for American eac;!es and
a slight decline in the London rate of dis
count were all developments toward a lessen
ing of the attraction at Paris for gold. At
advance In the Hank of England* â¢ rate of dis
rouni to-morrow is not felt to be so certain
now a? yester.!.T-. The immediate continuity
of the gold export movement Is ;hus felt to
be In doubt. But if military operations are
to be carried on In China the needs of foreign
Governments for capital will certainly con
verge upon Now York as this Is now the cheap
est money market in the world. But the un
tasiness is caused by the conjecture as to tl.e
effect upon the New York money market when
the interior demand for moving crops is addtd
to the foreign demand. The money market in
New York continues dull, but funds for time
loans for the longer periods are scarce.
The bond market continued dull and the
fluctuations were uneven. Total sales, pat

wired that all talk of crop improvement was
nonsense and that the plant was """loraiing

Butler, Cheese and Eggs.
Egps are higher. The recent hot weather In
the interior has affected even those brands
which are usually known as fancy, and thus
has reduced the supply of really fine Eggs.
Another factor in the r.dvance is the desire on
the part of some dealers to get California Kggs \
up so that they can sell their Eastern Eggs,
which are now coming in freely. Some of these
Eastern Eggs come from the northern tier of
States and are fresh and sound, and selling at
17c: but Egga from Kansas and Nebraska are
known as "net weather" Eggs at this time of
the year, and nre being offered down to 14/?13c.

Nectarines and Figs are scarce and firm.
Peaches are steadier. Very few good Peaches
are belnc* received here, the arrivals being
mostly confined to refuse lots .which canners
and Eastern shippers do not want This large
ly accounts for the low quotations for this
fruit.
Apricots are on their last legs and buyers
are Icrlns their Interest In them. Plums are

vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
There was a general flatness among gilt-edged
seciirlties 'n the markets here to-day owing to
the spread of the Chinese rebellion and Gen
eral De-wet's escape threugh General Roberts'
cordon. It is rumored that the Indian Gov
ernment Is.abiut to offer Â£6,000.000 threes. It
Id now gent-rally expected that the bank rate
will be advanced to 3Vi per cent to-morrow. It
would be made 4 per cent but for the necessi
ties of the treasury bill Issue.

CHICAGO. July IS.â Trade In wh?at was only
moderate and the course of the market lr
repular The opening was firm, September Â«4e
over the close yesterday at Â«i%<377-'ibC. In this
bulge wen? to be found the Influence of highc-r
Liverpool ccbles, asmo Northwest rt-ports and
unfavorable reports from Dakota. On proflt
takinp. which met the Initial bulge, Septem
ber declined to "T^ic. Then in an erratic mood
the market rallied to 7:"4c but dropped off
with Breat rapidity from that to T7VÂ«c. Aftnin
thÂ» hard fighting bulls forced the price back
to 77*it/7Sc. In this they were assisted by
coverings by sc-nlpir.g shorts for profits. It
was following this bulge that the severest
rreak of the day occurred and brought the
market to an inglorious finish. Primarily tlie
break In corn was an influence. In addition
to this Southwest receipts were large and the
outside support a nervelers affair. The North
west, while clatminK irreparable damage for
the l)akotas and asserting that the rains had
found little of a crop left to help, were sellers.
September tumbled down to "S^c. and closed
soon r.fter in a weakened state \V*c under yes
terday at TCife'CUe.
Corn opened firm and held well until about
neon. Talk of a big crop started liquidation.
September clcsed lc lower at 3SiÂ£'g38%c.
Oatn were dull. September closed %c under
yesterday at 23%c.
Provisions were dull and Irregular, owln~ t-j
the fact that packers were buyers of lard and
ribs, but rather neglectful of pork. Septem
ber pork unchanged, lard Dc higher and ribs

None saw the old man in his hut after
his return from the annual harvest festi
val held last night by the Indians. The
tribesmen had a big jollification and as
usual during such celebrations consumed
much "tire water." Larado's companions
said he had been overwell supplied when
he left them and started for his cabin,
which is isolated from the main rancheria.
It is supposed that Larado had stumbled
about his hut wltht a lighted candle and
set his bed afire while so helpless from
drink that he could not save himself,
being suffocated by the quickly burning
straw in his cabin bunk.
Larado, an aged Indian at Niles, met a
horrible death by cremation this morning
In the burning of his cabin, which is
among the homes of the dark-skinned
dwellers near the town. Constable Rod
erick saw the hut ablaze before daylight.
He went out to the Indian rancheria and
managed to extinguish the blare. Know
ing that the occupant of the dingy cabin
was old and feeble the Constable searched
for the Indian and found the corpse,
burned to a crisp, in the ruined shack.

The number tor vallejo roadsters, heats
three In tive, almost resulted j n a reunion
of the Smith family, three drivers of that
not unfamiliar name participating. After
dropping the first heat to Rebecca, driven
by J. U Smith, N. G. Smith, presiding
ever the destinies of Easter I\ made a
show of his company in three straight.
Tom Smith Jr.. behind Echo, did not fare
so well as the other Smiths, never finish
ing better than fourth.
The smart ones were a unit in thinking
McBriar. after hi* good race at Napa, a
cinch for the trot, and the checks wore
laid down accordingly. When the horses
were summoned the MoKtnney horse
brought 10, with only a limited demand for
the entire field at C>. The rirr-t choice drew
a position in the second tier for the open
ing heat, and after making two losing
breaks Just beat the distance flag In. Bob
Ingersoll passed Vic Schiller when squared
away for the wire, cake walking home in
2:l^i. Prince L was second, with Santa
Anita Star a pood third.
The result apparently did not scare the
partisans of McPriar, for he pt ill had a
decided call both for the next heat nnd
result. After considerable tedious and
unnecessarv scoring the horses were dis
patched in" the second heat to a pretty
start, Prince L cutting in and taking the
pole position at the turn. Before the half
was reached Cecil, behind Inprersoll. had
assumed the lead, with McBriar looming
up dangerously in second place. Ingersoli
got over the line first by a length. Ath
erlne this time finished third.
The third and concluding heat resolved
down to a duel bt-tweeeh the favorite and
Bob Inptrsoll. Donathan sent McBriar
out from the word, Cecil not putting in
his challenge until nearing the bend for
the wire. In a dinqdong- struggle Inger
boII turneii the verdict by a head.
Those who persist in playing favorites
in running recitals will soon be subjects
for the recruiting- station. Be Happy
looked like something tailor-made and
was left at the post starting an even
money chance. Clarnndo, once 15 to 1,
won all the way. Ricanlo conceded the
place to Manzanilla. The running-horse
folks here are kicking because more
purses are not hung up, but if to-day's
affair is a sample one is a great sufficiency
for any track. Summary:
Of tlie harness events, nothing but
praise coukl be sain, the 2:40 class trot

made a splendid effort In the thir.; and

The present Ferious awpoct of the trouble
is due to the legal proceeding which is be
ing taken against two suspected murder
ers'. Two Ping Ktfng Tong men were ar
rested for the killing of Ah How. an Ong
Yick man. and the tone to which the pris
oners belonged gave the murdered man's
friends $600 on condition that they would
not prosecute the case or appear as wit
nesses. The Ong Yicks accepted the
money and now announce that they will
appear in court. Their failure to keep
their promise has caused much bitter feel
ing and may cause the war which, as in
the cases of the other highbinder affair
starting in the country, is expected to
terminate in this city.
The police fear that the trouble which
started between the' Ping Kong Tons and
thei Ong Yicks in Sacramento about three
weeks ago will be transferred to this city.
Ah Fook. who resides on Waverly place,
Â¦went to the capital to adjust the difliculty
last week, but returned Tuesday and re
ported matters in a much worse condition
than when he arrived there.
Tong Vonp. a you.ni? Americanized
Chinese residing on SpofTord alley, joined
Uncle Sam's navy last week. He secured
a position as cook, but his duties were
misunderstood by his countrymen and he
was immediately branded as a traitor to
his native land. It was thought that he
had enlisted for the purpose of fighting
against China, and for several days a
horde of highbinders followed him aoout
Chinatown eager for his Ufe. Yong ap
plied to the police for protection and un
til yesterday, when he lei't the city, he
was under the surveillance of Sergeant
ilahoney's squad.
On Monday night a large crowd
gathered about his place and had started
to batter the door down when the police
arrived. The crowd was dispersed and
since then Yong's house on tipofford alley
has been watched. Yong escaped the
wrath of his pursuers by departing lor
Vallejo yesterday.

Chretien in the Police Court.
The case of John : M. Chretien, charged
, Judge Troutt followed Perry. He was
asked as to the appointment of Chretien,
and he reiterated tne story Chretien told
in his first confessionâ that Chretien had
been appointed upon his own solicitation
and only after Ruef- had signified his wil
lingness that he should serve. Then Judge
Troutt, went deeper into thf case and
told how ho fixed fees in probate cases
and how he appointed attorneys to care
for the estajtes that were before him. In
this he was referring to the statements
that he had thrown too much business into
the* hands of Stevens and Colton. He
cited the case of Judge Myrick, now de
ceased, who on every occasion appointed
an attorney named Bradford as attorney
for absent heirs and for other services re
quiring the attention of a lawyer. In the
two men he had appointed the most times
he said he had always found zealous
friends of the court and attorneys who
had ever>" care for the court's honor. "If
I had appointed one of them in this case,"
he remarked, "there would have been no
scandal."
Ben Day, Rogers' assigneee, was then
called to tell what he knew of the assign
ment. As that was nothing he was let
go within a few minutes. Then Ed Niles
was called to telhall he knew about
"Dutchy" and his whereabouts, and he did
not take long. Gaines, the janitor of the
building in which Chretien has his office,
was the next man. He was wanted to
identify certain papers In the Sullivan
estate which he had witnessed. Colthorp
and Chretien wound up the list, Colthorp
to tell a little more about the papers he
had signed as Sullivan and Chretien to
elaborate a few of the many things he had
told the Grand Jury.
The jury then adjourned until to-mor
row at 2 o'clock. When that afternoon
session ends there will probably be two
indictments placed on- file â one against
Chretien and one against Rogers.
Chretien's indictment may be upon forg
ery, perjury, obtaining money under false
pretenses or conspiracy to rob the dead.
That of Rogers will be brought upon the
evidence and because he refused to tell
Â¦what he knows. L
Judge Troutt on the Stand.
George B. Keane, Ruef's clerk, came
next to deny the truth of Chretien's state
ment that he had a conversation with
Keane in which an agreement between
Ruef and Chretien was discussed. He also
took in about a ton of books, and with the
jurors he went over the items referring to
the Sullivan estate and explained them.
George Perry then took the stand to
throw some light on the attitude of Rog
ers. .. He told the story, which has ap
peared In The Call, that he went aftÂ«T
Rogers a week ago yesterday and brought
him down to Rauer's office. He was asked
to step aside while Rauer and Rogers
were talking, but Rauer is his client and
he felt he needed the advice and protec
tion of a man who knew the law. so he
stepped no farther than the door. He
hcanr Rauer tell Rogers that now the
whole thing had turned out to be crooked
he wanted his money backâ his SGOO â and
Perry swore that Rogers told him he
would not return a cent, that his word
was as good as Rauer's and Rauer could
raise trouble if he liked. Perry also testi
fied as to Rauer's connection with the
case and the payments of money. These
Perry said had been made In each case
only after an inspection of the records by
himself and after he had been satisfied
that upon * the- face everything was
straight.
Denies Chretien's Statement.
make life a burden to himself, his. at
torney and his clerks and so to gÂ«-t rid of
him lie paid out the money. The lirst re
ceipt bears date of March 7, 1900. and is for
$20..'; the second bears date of March 10
and is for $200, and the third bears date of
April 21 and is for J100. On the stand in
Judge Troutt's court duriny the investi
gation Ruef swori- that all tnere was ever
taken from the estate was $200 that Drink
house paid "out of his personal account"
to Chretien. He says he would have told
about the extra five hundred, but no one
questioned him, and anyway ho was
stopped before he lintshed his testimony.
L. W. Storror, superintendent of the
Postal Telegraph Company, was the first
witness of the day. He was called to tell
of the telegrams that passed between
Chretien in San Francisco and "Dutchy"
in Sacramento. He was followed by Wil
liam Stinson, cashier of the Anglo-Califor
nian Bank, who identified the checks ho
had cashed for Rauer and Chretien. Then
the negro Golthorp came to tell more of
the signing of the name of John Sullivan
and I^ee D. Craig followed him to explain
how he attests signatures when the
signers are not present. He was taken
through the details of his business and
was made to explain a great many things
as to his methods. He took occasion to
deny that he had seen Keane in his office
when the deed he attested was signed,
correcting a statement to the contrary he
had made in Judge Troutfs court.
Judge Charles A. Low followed to ex
plain the report that he had told Chretien,
for Ruef. to keep his mouth closed. He
said nothing of the kind ever occurred.
Then John A: Drinkhouse came in with
his receipts and brought a new bit of tes
timonv into the case Just when every one
thought there was no more to tell. By his
statements it seems that $700 instead of
$200 has been paid out, and all the checks
are made out as "advancements" on Sul
livan's share.
j Salaries of Those Sent From the
Polytechnic to Lincoln to Be
Lowered.
Owing to an accident to Director Den
j man while alighting from a Powell-street
j car Tuesday night and the absence of Dl
| rector Kincald. the meeting of the Board
j of Education which was to have - been
i held yesterday morning was postponed
until next Monday. The Board will then
consider the contemplated reduction of
palarles of those teachers who were trans
ferred with the commercial course from
the Polytechnic High to the Lincoln
Grammar Fchool. The salary of C. H.
Murphy, who has been placed in charge
of the course, has already been raised
from $140 to $155. but It is understood that
Mrs. S. W. McPherson and Miss E. D.
Armer. who are in receipt of $140 and $120
respectively as high school assistant
teachers, will be reduced to $110 and $100.
The Board contemplates reducing the sal
ary of Miss M. G. Saleede, teacher of
Spanish, from $100 to $75, though Chair
man Mark says that it Is Intended to only
"adjust" the salaries.
The salaries of the three teachers of
stenography, Mrs. T. F. Spencer, Miss M
B. Conway and Miss L. Richards, have
been fixed at $75 per month, though ac
cording to Superintendent Webster they
should be $?3, which Is the pay of a gram

"Our Industrial Conditions" was the
subject of a lecture delivered by ex-Sena
tor R. A. DaETuo last night at Turk-street
Temple. The speaker read a number of
statistics, from which he drew the con
elusion that the industrial conditions of
the present day are not Improved over
w'.iatthey were in the past. He argued
that as the world's products increased the
producer's. share constantly decreased un
til it is now but 10 per cent of the whole
output. He stated as his belief that 52
per cent of the population of the United
States was born in poverty and was con
demned to a life of servitude. Socialism,
he contended, was a remedy for all exist
ing ills of society.

tjpP XOTHER day has failed to finish
/l_\ the investigation of the Grand Jury
It W into the steals of Chretien and his
friends, but the jury has gone deep
enough to begin to see the light and Fri
day afternoon the effect of It all w-ill prob
ably be apparent.
Yesterday the Jury heard fifteen wit
nesses. Their testimony was sensational,
but it has all been published. They told
under oath what they had voluntarily told
before. Rogers was not called. His case
has reached a point where the jurors do
not care much whether or not he will an
swer questions. If he should answer it
will look well and he might clear himself
of the charges that are brought against
him directly and by implication. If he
persists In his refusal an indictment will
probably follow anyway, bo that there is
not much to be gained by a "stand upon
rights."
More Money Paid Chretien.
A new development In the case of the
Fublic Administrator was brought out in
the testimony of John A. Drinkhouse, who
was examined during the afternoon. It
had been supposed all along that but $200
had been paid out of the estate of Sullivan
to Chretien and that the money was
drawn from the personal funds of Drink
house. Drinkhouse's testimony showed,
however, that $500 more had been loaned
to Chretien in three installments, for each
of which Chretien had given receipts. He
signed them all. "John Sullivan, by .John
M. Chretien, his attorney in fact." The
receipts are made out to "John Sullhan,
sole heir of Joseph Sullivan, deceased, as
an advancement out of his said distribu
tive share." This did not look much like
money out of the private funds of the
Public Administrator and the Grand Jury
questioned closely as to how the money
came to be paid. Drinkhouse testified
that Chretien haunted the office so as to
with forgery, was agrain called in Judge
Fritz's court yesterday morning. By con
sent it was continued until this morning
at 9 o'clock, on the understanding that it
would go on until finished, as the Judge

WITNESSES SAT AROUND AND WORRIED WHTXE THE JURY WAS IN SESSION.
antJ-bos? Republicans of the
Fourth Congressional District can
pain control of the governing body
i-i of the rarty in this district if they
will turn out ar.d vote for anti-boss
delegates to the Cor.gr^sFional District
Convention. It is conceded that Julius
Knhn will be renominated without oppo
sition. The only contest in view is that
relating to the selection of a Congres
ricnal District Committee, -which commit
tee will constitute, under the primary
election law, the governing body of the
Tarty In its district.
The existing committee of Â¦which Archi
bald Bernard is chairman and P. H.
Prendf-rpast secretary is controlled by
the notorious bosses. Crimmins and Kelly.
The governing body of the Republican
party of the district therefore goes to the
ikllnt saloon for instructions.
The district is one embracing many of
the leading commercial institutions of
California. In many rr-spe<-ts it is one of
the most important Congressional dis
tricts in the United States. Republican
merchants and business men cannot per
mit corrupt and notorious bosses to con
trol the governing body of the party In
this district, without consenting to the
endorsement of a disgraceful proposition.
The bosses now con trolling the commit
tee suspected some weeks ago that the
delegates to be elected to the Republican
Etcte Convention, at Santa Cruz would
change the governing body for the better,
hence they availed themselves of the pro
vision of the election taw which permits
the committee to call for a separate con
vention, ar.d a petition was therefore hied
In the Secretary of State's r.fflcp at Sacra
rronto for a place on the official ballot for
delegates to such separate convention.
The bosses piieaked under cover to file the
petition. They were planning to elect
a squad of "nobodies" in each district. It
ni thÂ« programme to spring the dele
pate ticket on the eve of the election and
confaee the voters by the use of anti-boss
latv-ls.
Republicans of the district are now fully
sdvised regarding the r-cheme of the Mint
raloon bosses. As there were many in
ouiries regarding the apportionment of
delegates under the petition filed by the
i.oyses. The Call sent to Sacramento for
a copy of the document.
ThÂ«- petition was filed on July 5. The
convention is to be composed of slxty
peven delegates. Neither the time nor the
p'.ace of holding the convention is men
tioned fn the application for a place on the
official ballot. The provision in the peti
tion bearing upon this point says:
