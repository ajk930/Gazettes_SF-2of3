THE CITY OF MONZA. WHERE KING HUMBERT MET HIS DEATH
Sfor.za is situated in Lcmbardy, ten miles north of Milan, and has for a
lcng time been the summer residence of the Kings of Sardinia and Italy.
Kin? Humbert and his family generally spent some eight months of the year
at the Villa Real, within tho confines of the city. Monza has a population
of about i?,D09. It was the capital of the Lombard Kingdom of Italy, and
boasts of a number of ancient historic buildings, among which is the cathe
dral, founded A. D. Z%. by Que^n Theodellnda, where is kept since ages back
the iron crown and regalia of Lombardy. The tall tower of the cathedral
is shown on the left of the picture, while on the right, near the foreground.
Is seen the front of the municipal building, in the rear of which lies the Ath

BRUSSELS, July 30â A special dispatch
from Rome says: Mgr. Angelo di Pietro,
prefect of the Congregation of the Coun

Pope of the assassination of King- Hum
bert. He entered the chamber of the
Pope at an early hour. The latter was
already awake.
The Cardinal cautiously first stated that
an attempt had been made upon the life
of the King, whereupon the Pope Immed
iately asked if the wound was dangerous.
The prelate replied, "Very dangerous."
But his anxious air was noticed by the
Pope, who at once divined the truth. His
emotion was such that he was, unable to
speak for some time. When hfs distress
had passed he wished to leave his bed
and to celebrate mass for the repose of the
King's soul.
Later he summoned Cardinal Rampolla,
Papal Secretary of State, whom he re
quested to send a dispatch of condolence
to the Princess Clotildc sister of the
Queon. The audiences fixed for to-day
were suspended.

PARIS. July S3.â The account of the
assassination of King Humbert has cre
ated profound sorrow in official circles
here. All official fetes have been aban
doned until after the obsequies. The flags
of all public buildings are draped. The
Italian embassy and the Italian building
at the exposition are in heavy mourning.
Only one morning paper, r Eclair, had the
news, and this very briefly. Its sale was
tremendous and every one on the boule
vards this morning was eagerly scanning
the insufficient news.
When notified of the death of King
Humbert, President Loubet sent a mili
tary officer of his household to express his
condolence to the Italian Embassador.
Count Tornellle-Brusati di Vergano.
Later In Uie afternoon the Embassador
visited the Palace of the Elysee and offi
cially announced the death of his sov
ereign. President Loubet sent to the new-
King of Italy the following:
"I place before your Majesty the ex
pression of unanimous Indignation of my
country against the odious attempt which
has taken from Italy its generous chief.
I bey your Majesty to accept this expres
sion "of my deep sympathy, and I place
at the feet of her Majesty. Queen Mar
gherita, my respectful homage and my
sincere condolences." -
It was rumored this afternoon that an
attempt had been made against the life
of the Shah of Persia, but investigation
proved that while the Shah was visiting
the exposition this morning a number of
his suite noticed near a rough looking per
son carrying poignards in his belt. On ac
count of his suspicious actions this indi
vidual was arrested.
Sympathy of the French.
All the Country Mourns.
Telegrams from all the towns and vil
lages of Italy show that all the country
deeply mourns the death of the King.
Kverywhere flaps are half-masted and
shops are closed. All garrison towns ; at
noon saluted with 1M guns, while at the
naval ports minute puns wore fired. The"
municipality of Milan half-masted its flap
and published a manifesto objurgating
the horrible tragedy. The bourse at
Rome has closed and not a store is open.
Signs of mourning . rapidly appeared
throughout the city. . Crape is displayed
uprtn many residences and public build
ings. Portraits of the murdered monarch
at points of vantage, draped in black, and
flags are flying at half-mast everywhere.
King Humbert's remains will be brought
to Rome and laid to rest in the Pantheon.
It Is stated that the name of the as
sassin does not appear in the list of dan
gerous anarchists known lo the police.
A few newspapers this morning pub
lished tributes to the noble qualities of
King Humbert, declaring that it is
through. his love for the working classes
that he has fallen a victim to assassina
tion. The papers add a few words of
sympathy and respect for the new King.
Â¦ % OME, July 30. â Thousands of tele
1*1 grams have been received from all
r"\ parts of the country indicative of
"I" I" thTTdeep* eorrnw^ffeH by* the whole
nation. Everywhere work was
suspended to-day and the bourses and
theaters were closed. In the principal
cities the municipal authorities are con
sidering plans to honor the memory of the
murdered monarch. At Messina a pro
cession marched through the streets
cheering for the house of Savoy and the
young King. At Palermo an imposing
demonstration proceeded in solemn si
lence to the municipal offices to express
the sorrow and indignation of the popu
lation, after which a vast crowd cheered
the new King. There were similar dem
onstrations in other towns.
The Conservator of the Quirinal has
sealed up all the private apartments of !
King Humbert and all the doors^ of the
palace except one. The member^ of the
diplomatic corps all went this morning to
the Foreign Office to tender their condo
lences. The visitors' books at the
Quirinal have already been filled with the
names of callers.
Profound calm prevails throughout the
entire country. Such members of the
Chamber of Deputies as are in Rome met
this morning and adopted a resolution ex
ecrating the crime and expressing un
bounded sorrow.
It appears that when King
Humbert was wounded he ex
claimed, "It is nothing."

Pope Leo. divining the worst, while the news was being gently broken to him, was overcome
with grief and at once expressed a desire to celebrate mass for the King's soul, and sent a dis
patch of condolence to Princess Ciothilde. Deep grief is shown throughout Italy, and profound
calm prevails, while the. authorities are prepared to quell any disorder that may arise. Should the
absence of King Victor Emmanuei ill extend beyond forty-eight hours a brief regency, it is said in
some quarters, will be established in accordance with the constitution.
It is asserted in Paris that on June 20 last the Italian Government was warned of an an
archist plot against the lives of King Humbert and four other monarchs.
While nations expressed their sympathy with Italy and her Queen in their bereavement, the
police of New York took steps to ascertain, if possible, whether Bressi's crime was an indepen
dent act of an individual or the outcome of a conspiracy. So far it has been ascertained that the
assassin sailed from New York on the Werra for Genoa June 23, and he was known as an anarch
ist. His name is said to be unknown in the list of dangerous anarchists held by the Italian police.
He has an American wife living in West Hoboken.

"It is nothing," exclaimed the King when he received his mortal wound. "I must take

SANTA ROSA. July 20.â News was received in thia city to-day that .Mrs. J.
W. Uagsdale, wife of the American Consul at Tientsin, together with her
children, Earl and Effle, and her daughter-in-law, Mrs. Bertrand Ragsdaie,
are safe at Nagasaki, Japan, having escaped from Tientsin on July 2. Con
sul Ragsdnle and his son, Bertrand, were, at the time of writing, still in Tien
tsin, having stayed at their posts. A letter written on June 13 was received
here about ten days ago, but beyond describing the scenes of activity witnessed
in the preparations for the expected trouble contained nothing startling. To-day's
letter, which arrived this morning addressed to Mrs. S. P. Whiting, was from
Mrs. Ragsdaie herself and contains much of interest, being in part as follows:
"I have started you a letter which I find I can't finish, telling you of our
siege and departure from Tientsin, where we left Mr. Ragsdaie and Bert well
and our house not injured. All the women and children have been ordered out
for fear of fever and famine. The place is packed with soldiers and they will
require all the houses for them. We have Americans, both .well and wounded,
at the consulate and we have a cook and other servants, gathered from the
refugees, so Mr. Ragsdale will be able to run the house. I wtis asked or rather
ordered to take my children and leave, to show to others that it was safe to
go to Taku. By the river it is a distance of sixty-eight -miles. We started on
July 2, at 11 a. m., on the Chinese Viceroy's tug, that had been captured by tho
Americans. So we came outâ Mrs. Bert Ragsdalo and buby, Effle and Earl and

acy, an American gunboat anchored in tho river. There we spent the* night
and learned of the firing on a party who came down two hours later than we
did. "? :Â¦ â¢ . %
"We only saw natives, but they met troops, proving it was not by any
means a safe trip that others might.be led to follow. We, by the advice of
Admiral Kempff, came on to Japan, as the wholo of China Is In a turmoil.
Will try to have the next letter ready to go by the first mail going oqt in a
few days on the City of Peking. Of our dear friends in Peking as yet wo know
nothing. The agony we have endured for them has been dreadful."
The letter states that the two Itagsdalo children. Earl and EfflÂ«. are now
en route to San Francisco, from where they will come to this city to make
their temporary home with friends. The writer says that it Is with the greatest
relief that she sees her children depart for a place of safety, her fear that
they might fall into the hands of the terrible Chlneso mob being always with her.

officials north of Mukden is not known.
The whole, Mukden district is menaced by

CHINESE REFOMERS
WOULD AID ALLIES
General MacArthur has protested so
vigorously against the withdrawal of
any more troops of his command that the
War Department authorities are reluc
tant to act against his wishes.
The Third and Seventh Infantry* regi
ments now in tho Philippines are under
orders for China, but will leave Manila
only in case of "extraordinary emer
gency."
The War Department has ordered two
more batteries of artillery to China. C of
the Seventh Regiment; now at. Fort Ad
ams, R. I., and M of the same regiment,
now at Washington Barracks. They will
go by the way of Nagasaki, and in the
event of a settlement of tho Chinese trou
bles will be sent to the Philippines.
That any legation buildings remain
standing and that any of their Inmates
are alive after being subjected to flre for
nearly a month is regarded here as little
short of marvelous and showing their
lack of efficiency.
Military men in Washington have all
along insisted that the International com
manders were overestimating the fighting
power of the Chinese troops. The, defeat
of a great force of Chinese at Tientsin by
a much smaller number Is cited as evi
dence of this.
WASHINGTON. July SO.â Although
Lieutenant Sanford of the signal corps
paid in his dispatch to General Greedy
that "further advance may not be matte
before September." . it is expected that
General Chaffee will strongly oppose any
fiuch^deiay. War Department officials
rely on the American commander to find
out speedily the exact situation which
confronts the international forces.
FIGHTING POWER OF
CHINESE OVERESTIMATED
WASHINGTON. Julv 30.â The tele
graphic conditions in China just new are
unsatisfactory and tho governments in
terested are endeavoring to better affairs.
The rta! cable station from which China
news is sent is Shanghai. The only way
the offife can be reached by wire from
Chefu is overland. This hind line is un
der the control of the Chinese authorities
and Slieng. of whom so much has oeen
published, and they control everything
which goes over It. The only communica
tion that the United States has between
Taku and Chefu is by naval vessels. It
is presmned, but Is not known, that the
international forces have telegraphic oom
municntion between Tientsin and Taku.
At Taku the conditions are not satisfac
tory. The international fleet, including the
American Â¦warships, lie far off shore and
messages must bo sent out to them by
tugs. The nations are trying to arrange
for a cable from Shanghai to Chefu. Al
ready arrangements have been mnde to
lay a cable across from Taku to Chefu,
and the United States will pay its share,
amounting to $150,000. Some difficulty is
encountered In arranging the details for
the international cabltj from Chefu to
Shanghai, as all the governments have to
be consulted and communication with the
cable office and telegraph companies must
be provided for.

Mr. Broderick added that the council of
admirals decided July 16 that the rail
road between Taku and Tientsin should
be guarded and should be managed by the
Russians. The Government has informed
Russia it acquiesced, as tho arrangement
might be the nj^pre convenient, but that It
must be clearly understood that the line
would revert to its former management,
that is. the British, on termination of hos
tilities. Mr. Broderick added that he did
not yet know who was to have supreme
command. British troops would be avail
able to co-operate with the allies, but no
arrangement has been made to put them
in command of foreign officers.
WASHINGTON. July 30. â _The
Secretary of State received at
midnight a dispatch from Mr.
Fowler. American Consul at
Chefu, dated July 29, noon. Mr.
Fowler says:
"A letter from the . German legation,
dated the 21st lnst.. has been received at
Tientsin. The German loss is between
ten and twelve injured. The Chinese
ceased their attack on the 12th. Baron
von Ketteler's body is said to be safe.
The Austrian, Dutch and Spanish lega
tions were destroy^, and the French par
tially. A letter from the Japanese lega
tion dated the 22d arrived at Tientsin on
the 25th. Ten battalions of Chinese
shelled the legations consecutively from
the 20th of June and stopped on the litn
of July, but may renew. The enemy are
decreasing. The German. Russian. Amer
ican. British and half the Japanese and
French legations arf* still defended. The
Japanese say they have food for six days,
but little ammunition. The Emperor and
Empress are reported at Peking."
Proceeding With Caution.
The effect of the day's news from China
was to freshen the hope that the Gov
ernment can noon get In direct communi
cation with Minister Conger. The mass
of testimony as to his being alive as late
as the 22d inst. is now so great as to war
rant the department in resuming consid
erations of projects for the future. With
all its anxiety to pet Mr. Conner and the
Americans in Peking safely away, the de
partment is proceeding with the proper
caution, and is by no means disposed to
accept any proposition that w.ould unduly
Jeopardize their lives. Such might be the
result of an off-hand acceptance of the
proposition to have the Chinese Govern
ment deliver the foreign Ministers at.
Tientsfn. for it Is realized that the escort
might be overpowered by superior forces
of Boxers on the way to the 9*Â»a. The
State Department has come to the con
clusion that Mr. Conner himself ia the
best person to Judge of the conditions un
der which his deliverance shall be ef
fected, and therefore it Is again looking
to the Chinese Government to place it in
communication with Mr. Conger in order
that it may be advised by him. That re
quirement was the first of the conditions
laid down by President McKinley in his
answer to the appeal of the Chinese Em
peror, so that the situation diplomatically
cannot be said to have been materially
changed by the developments of to-day.
The State Department was inclined to
regard Consul Fowler's communication as
the most valuable piece of confirmatory
evidence yet received touching the ea.tf.ty
of the Peklns diplomats. Up to a late
hour no answer had been received to the
second Congctf message, but in view of
Consul Fowler's news the officials were
Inclined to look forward to an early re-
Pl It is known here that Germany is one
of the governments which is putting forth
every effort to get Into direct communica

like the United States, has had recourse
to the "underground- route. An object of
special solicitude is to discover whether
Baroness von Ketteler has escaped or
whether she has shared the fate of her
husband. Up to the present nothing has
been received to throw light upon the
subject. : -2 , aa
Some Discrepancies.
Baron von Holleben. the Gern â¢ n -^ m "
-bassador. called upon Secretary Hay this
morning. He said he had not received an>
word from Berlin on receipt of the Im
portant letter from the German legauon
at P-kin*. described by Mr. Fowler.
As is always the casÂ« with these Chi
nese advices, a discrepancy appears im
mediately upon a comparison of the Ger
man and the Japanese advices. The
German representative said the attack
stopped on the 12th: the Japanese report
place*, the cessation of flrimc on the lUh.
The State Department officials believe
this is easily explainable by a considera
tion of the difference between the Chris
tian and Chinese calendars. Another cu
rlons statement, however, is contained in
the Japanese report that six legations
were belnp still defended on the 22d. Thij
Is in apparent conflict with Mr. Conger's
last reported statement that the legation
ers were "in the British^ legation under
continued shot and shell."
Jt was understood that Mr. Conger
meant that all the legatloners were in
the British legation, though this might
have been a strained Interpretation of hla
message, and the various legations men
tioned in the dispatch may be
still peopled. .- -V.
Military men here are amazed that the
legations successfully resisted nearly a
month's Incessant shelling by ten bat
talions of Chinese. That any trace of a
brick building should remain after such
a bombardment is utterly Inconceivable
by them.
Minister Wu Hopeful.
Chinese Minister Wu received the Fow
lew dispatch with satisfaction, but re
frained from any decided comment. He
Â¦aid:
"I am glad at last that the public here
and in Europe, has some news, front
Peking It has no possible reason to ques
tion. This news bears out what I have
maintained ever since the receipt of the
Conger dispatch. The Ministers are alive
and they have been aided by my Govern
ment, otherwise they could not haye held
out all this time.
"When this first horrible report of mas
sacres came from .Shanghai naturally I
was alarmed and distressed. I did my
duty as a loyal citizen of the empire and
tried to aid this Government in petting
news of Its Minister. When the Conger
dispatch came I felt It was genuine. It
was accepted by this Government and I
was satisfied. But ever since then there
have been many contradictory reports.
The rest of the world was not willing to
believe any truth could come out of China,
When Imperial edicts were Issued, pledg
ing the faith of my Government that the
Ministers were safe, there always was
bad news manufactured, some excuses
made to offset the Chinese reports. The
Chinese were made out to be a set of liars
and murderers, as though there were not
liars and murderers in all countries. Now
comes this news from European sources
and transmitted through American hands.
Thus there is now no chance for the un
believers to doubt It. I am glad of it on
my own account, but more so for Secre
tary Hay, who has thus won a great vic
tory against the skepticism of all Europe."
Regarding the reports that the. Minis
ters were being held as hostages, Wu said
it was very unlikely. They might be un-

FUNDS TO MEET THE
EXPENSES IN CHINA
ACCUMULATING advices by runners from the beleaguered legations in Peking assure the world that the bulk of the
foreigners were aiive on July 21; After nearly four weeks of shelling, which cost the lives of sixty-two Europeans,
an armistice was declared on July 16. Sir Claude Macdonald reports the Chinese barricades very close, and the
German diplomat expresses fear of a renewal of the attack.
â¢Apparently, however, the present safety of the envoys is assured, and : the problem of their rescue is the vital
one.. LJ Hung Chang and other Vieroys are memorializing the throne to. send the diplomats to Tientsin or to allow

Sir Claude Macdonald's dispatch, dated Peking, July 21,
according to cable copy, and received in cipher, is accepted on
all sides as dispelling doubts that might still have existed regard
ing the genuineness of the dispatch. Owing to an error in
.transmission the message fails to show the number of wounded.
David Oliphant and Warren were two student interpreters.
The message fails to mention the other legations and other
matter of pressing importance, but it should be borne in mind
that the British Minister may not be aware that all his previous
dispatches have been suppressed. He may be under the im

Davenport had been engaged as 'master
to take a scow to Dawson from White

King said: "You have bamboozled us fel
lows long enough. Davenport, and I'm
going to kill you."
King reached for his rifle and covered
Davenport. "Don't shoot," cried the vic
tim. King fired, the bullet entering Dav
enport's heart and killing him. Charles
Everett and Lester Kneuff, assisting in
taking the scow down the river, were
witnesses to the crime. King covered
them with the rifle and made them swear
that they would say on their arrival at
Dawson that Davenport had met death
by accident. When the scow reached that
town, however, they told the police of the
murder and King was arrested.
The body of Davenport was hidden
along the bank of the river.

SAX JOSE, July 30.â A. J. Barney, a
half-witted young man about 22 years old,
to-day confessed to Sheriff Langford that
he blew up the powder magazine of Weil
heime,r & Sons at iTountain View a couple
of weeks ago, wnVn that town narrowly
pscaDod being wrecked.
Ever since the explosion Barney has
boon suspected, and so convinced of the
fact were Sheriff Langford and Constable
Martin of Mountain View that they
caused the man's arrest on a charge of
vagrancy in order to hold him. July 18
the Justice of the Peace at Mountain
View sentenced Barney to serve sixty
days for vagrancy.
To-day Barney broke down and told of
his guilt. About a year ago the Well
heimers had refused him credit at the
store, and his act was one of revenge.
He says he simply wanted to wreck the
powder magazine and injure property be
longing to the Weilheimers. He "pried
open the door to the magazine, punched a
hole in a keg of black powder and insert
ed a fuse. After inserting the fuse he
was afraid he would not be able to get
away quick enough, and so he removed
the keg of black powder from where it
was stored near two cases of giant pow
der to the door. He then ran away, and
after the explosion returned./
The fact that Barney removed the can
of black powder from near the giant pow
der prevented an explosion that undouot
edly would have wrecked the town, for,
strange as It may seem, only tho keg of
black powder exploded. This wrecked
the magazine, broke large plateglass win
dows 300 feet away and did considerable
damage.
Barney will now be charged with a
more perious offense, but owing to his
bring half-witted It is not known just
what will be done with him. He has an
aged mother residing at Mountain View.

REDWOOD. July 30.â The second trial
of John Fitzgerald for the murder ot John
Lennon, December 24, 1S99, commenced
here this morning before Judge W. P.
Lawler, sitting forejudge Buck. The en
tire morning and afternoon was occupied
in selecting a jury, and when court ad
journed eleven men were sworn to try
the case. It is probable that the jury will
be completed in a short Â«time to-morrow
morning â¢ and the taking of testimony
commenced before noon.
The jurymen so far chosen are: George
Greeley. John Blggio, David S. Jackson.
Charles A. Orth. Horace Nelson, George
P. Ellis, Victor Boicello. Christian Beck,
George F. Adair, Aldrich Fenner and R.
C. Holmquist. Several days will be con
sumed in hearing the evidence.
At the previous trial the jury disagreed,
though none voted for acquittal, the only
difference existing in the minds of the
jurors being as to the degree of crime,
part standing lor murder in the first de
gree and the remainder for manslaughter.
Fitzgerald is accused of killing Lennon
at the latter's house near Colma on
Christmas eve of last year, at which
place both men had been living for a long
time. When found Cennon was lying on
the kitchen floor dead and a discharged
rifle belonging to Fitzgerald was found
in the adjoining room. Fitzgerald could
not be found that night, though, as the
evidence showed, he w'as seen coming
from the direction of the house shortly
after the shooting occurred. He was ar
rested in San Francisco on the following
day, and his face showed at that time
that he had been subjected to rough
treatment at the hands of some one at a
recent period.
The defense upon the former trial was
accident, the killing being admitted. The
defendant testified that he had a quarrel
with Lennon on the night In question and
that a/ struggle occurred between them
over the gun, in which it was accidentally
discharged, the bullet piercing Lennon's
breast. Both men had been drinking.

SEVERE CENSURE
OF TBE SOUTHERN
PACIFIC COMPANY
JA.MES TAYLOR ROGERS presented
a pitiful spectacle in Judge Ca
baniss' court yesterday. when
driven to bay by the questions or
Assistant District Attorney Deuprey. He
declined to answer them on th>Â» ground
that it would tend to incriminate him and
degrade his character. He squirmed on
his seat and fenced and at times was so
\ defiant that not even the soothing tones
i of his attorney, Barclay Henley, nor the
] veiled threats of the Judge h-\d the effect
. of toning him down. For about an hour
' and a half the baitinp was kept up and it
j was interspersed with arguments of at
i torneys as to whether or not the ques
j tions should be answered. The Judse
! has taken till this afternoon at 2 o'clock
' to make up his mind as to whether Rogers
will be compelled to answer the queries
which will tend to develop whether Chre
tien offered Rogers money to withdraw
his opposition to the distribution of the
Joseph Sullivan estate.
When the Chretien case was called yes
terday morning the court stenographer
was asked to repeat the question put to
Rogers Friday, and for refusing to answer
which he was committed to jail. The
stenographer read: "What is your occu
pation?"
Kog^rs Balks Once More.
Rogers said he desired to lodge an
objection before answering.
"I thought." said the Judge, "that be
fore I dismissed the contempt proceed
ings Saturday you agreed to answer all
questions."
Rogers said he would answer, but he
desired to read his objection first. The
Judge told him to go ahÂ»ad and he started
to read from a typewritten document to
the effect that the court had no jurisdic
tion as the subject-matter was now 6e>
fore the Grand Jury- Before he finished
tbe Judge stopped him by overruling his
j objection, but at his request the document
i was filed.
Rogers then answered that he was an
i attorney. To further questions he replied
j that he filed an application October 17.
j ISStt. in the matter of the estate of Joseph
.Sullivan, deceased, on behalf of Mary
Ann, Helena and Philip Sullivan. He also
: riled a petition for distribution of tho
estate. He received a written authority
from the Sullivans and would produce it
in court.
"Did you have any conversation with
; John M. Chretien, the defendant here, in
: relation to vour appearing on behalf of
'< Mary Ann Sullivan. Helena Sullivan and
I Phillip Sullivan and contesting his ap
i plication on behalf, of John Sullivan in
j the matter of the estate of Joseph Sul
' livan. deceased?" asked Deuprey.
Rogers hesitated for a few minutes and
; the Judge losing patience asked him if
! he understood the question.
"I do, sir." replied Roprers. and after
i ancther pause, said: "Your Honor, 1
I desire to Interpose an objection." and he
' pulled a typewritten document out of his
! pocket which he was permitted to read.
It was as follows:
Directly Declines to Answer.
With due respect to this court and Its Judge
now presiding and without Intending to prevent
' justice being done In thip case I decline to an
pwpr such questions and all others In any way
calling for testimony from me concerning 1 my
alleged relationship or conversations with the
dffendant John M. Chretien, or his adviser
I George H. Perry, or with J. J. Kaunr and Rob
i ert Colthorp. witnesFPs herein for the people.
! or any one- o' them, as to anything done by
me with or ?ald by me to either of them in thÂ«
estate of Joseph Huliivan. defeated. No. 21.632.
Hr-partment No. 10 of the Superior Court of
this city and county of San Francisco, Call-
I fornia.
For the purpose of this declination and wlth-
out waiving any other right It Is admitted that
mv appearance as an attorney in paid case was
fifed on October 1*"., 1899, for one Mary Ann Sul
livan and Helena Sullivan and their brother,
Phill!;> Sullivan, alleged niec#?s and nephew of
thf deceased, and that a petition for distribu
tion to them' was presented and on May 4, 1900.
prior to the decree of distribution, was with
drawn- and that on and since July 17, 1000. the
Grand Jury of this city and eonnty has inves
tigated my withdrawal, etc., as to whether or
not my acts as an attorney therein had been
criminal or disgraceful.
Gives Reasons in Detail.
The reasons for my refusal now to testtfy. are
these:
Firstâ That by reason of the people having
submitted the whole subject matter of the al
leRÂ«Kl crime or crimes relative to the estate of
Joseph Sullivan, deceased, lnclutflnR the pres
ent, forgery charge, to the Grand Jury for con
sideration * this court has lost Jurisdiction
thereof and now has no power to conduct this
Secondâ Such question and others like It are
not pertinent to the forgery under investiga
tion.
Third.â The answer to this question and others
like It might be made the foundation of a crim
inal action against myself or furnish one or
more links in the chain of evidence against
me. And under the fifth amendment of the
T'nited States constitution and section 13 of
article 1 of the constitution of California, "No
person can be> compelled in any criminal case
to be a witness against hlmsÂ»lf, nor.be de
prived of life, liberty or property without duo
process of law."
Pis Character Not an Issue.
Fourthâ That an answer to Fuch question
and others like it might have a direct tendency
to degrade my character, which Is not a fact
at ispue in this forsery case. Section 2063 of
the Code of Civil Procedure of the State of
California grants me the privilege to refuse an
answer under such circumstances. '
Fifthâ The answer to such question and
others like it may be used to accuse me of per
jury in so testifying should the same be con
tradictory to the testimony heretofore given
before rtie said Grand Jury or in this case by
the said defendant John M. Chretien, or hi3
adviser. George H. Perry, or by the witnesses
J. J. Rauer and Robert Colthorp. who have,
according to my belief, confederated deliber
ately together to accuse me of some crime In
relation to the estate of the said Joseph Sulli
van, deceased. The testimony given by them
before the Grand Jury is unknown to me, and
as I cannot tell what is true or Xalse therein
It Is impossible for me to testify herein. My
belief Is positive, based on many facts, that
such a conspiracy Is formed against me and is
uslne this case to accomplish Ha wicked pur
pose, i Â»
Court Has Jurisdiction.
After Rogers had finished the Judge
said he would dispose at once of the ob
jection that the court had no Jurisdiction.
On the others he would like to hear from
Deuprey.
Deuprey ask-?d Rogers to point out in
what way an answer to the question
would tend to degrade his character.
"The law does not require me to point
out in what way," replied Rogers.
"Did the defendant Chretien give you
any information on which to base your
allegation that John Sullivan was not a
brother of Joseph Sullivan?", was the next
question.
"I cay no." answered Rogers.
"Will" you state whether or not you held
any conversation with Mr. Chretien in re
gard to your appearance on behalf of
these three Sullivans named in your no
tice of appearance and as to withdrawing
your claim, and whether an offer of any
amount of money was made for your
withdrawal thereof; or did you discuss
the amount?"
Rogers declined to answer the question
for the reasons already given, and a long
argument followed, ending in Deuprey
substituting the question: "After you ap
peared for the three Sullivans would you
state whether or not Mr. Chretien offered
you any money to withdraw?"
Rogers declined to answer, as it would
tend to incriminate him.
ASSISTED BY JUDGE CABANISS, EUGENE DEUPREY TRIES TO WRING
ANSWERS FROM JAMES TAYLOR ROGERS.
"Would the answer." asked the Judge,
"be liable to convict him of a felony?"
After argument the Judge said he would
pass the question and give his decision as
to whether the defendant should answer
it to-day.
"Did not Chretien after your appear
ance In the matter, and before the distri
bution of the estate, offer you $300 or $400
to have you withdraw your application
on behalf of your clients?" was asked.
Attorney Barnes for the first and only
time interposed an objection, that the
question was irrelevant, incompetent and
immaterial, and it was sustained.
"Did you not refuse the offer of $300 or
HOO and ask for $S00 or $10)0 to withdraw?"
Rogers declined to answer the question.
The Judge said he considered it his duty
to protect the witness, and that he need
not answer It.
Threatened With Jail Again.
"Did you not as a matter of fact, at the
time of the hearing of the application for
the distribution of the estate, remain
mute and allow the decree of distribution
to go to John Sullivan?" was' the/next
query. , ."'
Rogers declined to answer, and the
Judge passed the question until to-day.
Rogers denied that he was in court that
day, but later said he was present on
May 3, the day before the decree of dis
tribution was made, and also on the
morning of May 4, in Judge Troutt s
chambers. He did not see John Ssullivan
in court. He never saw him. It was slat
ed in open court that his clients were not
relatives, as the name was spelled iwo
ways, and he left the court with J. J.
Rauer. They went to the Hlbernia Bank
and found it was so. He did not know
who made the statement In court.
"Was Chretien in conversation with
Rauer In the court?" was asked.
"1 suppose so. They were all together.'
replied Rogers.
"After going with Rauer to the Hiber
nia Bank, what induced you to with
draw?"
Rogers declined to answer and the ques
tion was passed for decision to-day.
"After vour visit to the bank with
Rauer you didn't appear again, did you?"
"I did.t' replied Rogers. "I appeared in
Judge Troutfs chambers."
"Did you press your claims subsequent
ly?"
"I decline to answer." said Rogers de
flantlv "and will stand upon it."
"Would your answer incriminate you
or tend to degrade your character?"
Henley interposed and suggested that
the witness should answer "Yes" and also
for the other reasons given.
"Show me my protest," said Rogers, and
the Judge said angrilv:
"If you don't answer I'll put you in jail
for contempt, irrespective of your consti
tutional rights."
There was a pause a;id the Judge said,
"Well, what answer do you give?"
Forced to Give Specific Answer.
''I decline to answer." replied Rogers,
"because it might be used as the founda
tion for a criminal charge against me and
1 will restate the other grounds."
"I direct you," said the Judge, "to give
a specific answer to the question as to
whether It will tend to incriminate you.
Tes, or no?"
Henley again urged Rogers to answer
"Yes, and on other grounds."
"I decline to answer." said Rogers, "be
cause the reply misht trnd to furnish
matter for an accusation of crime against
me."
The Judge thought Deuprey should be
satisfied with that and he consented.
"Have you taken any steps to set aside
the distribution?"
"Will you state that you took no action
by reason of the money given you by
Kauer?"
Witness declined to answer.
Rogers said he was not present at the
taking of a deposition of the alleged John
Sullivan in Notary Knox's office and re
ceived no notice that such deposition was
to be made. He did not know who in
formed him that the deposition had been
made. He examined it after it had been
filed in court. He did not find that there
was absolute lack of proof of John Sulli
van's identity.
This closed the examination of Rogers
for the prosecution and the case was con
tinued till this afternoon at 2 o'clock
when the Judge will drclde whether Rog
ers will be compelled to answer the ques
tions passed.

An official report which furnishes a
complete confutation of the plague ecare
has l*een held back from public inspection
for reasons best known to themselves b7
the members of the State Board of
llesliA. to which body it was submitted.
After the executive session held by the
board in the Grand Hotel last Saturday
i.ight it was announced by those members
that nothing had taken place in the meet
ing that was worthy of pub'ic notice. It
was evea said by some members that the
public had no right to know what oc
curred during: tho meetings.
Despite tbe aar.ounwraent that nothing
worthy of putlic notice had taken place
a number of reports were read. Among
them was a statement cf the result of tbe
experiments m&Ce by Dr. SiJas Mouser of
7U7 Busr. street with soirie alleged bubonic
Epedrceis which the Lx>urd had given him
with instructions to finally determine
their nature. The report which Dr.
ilouser banded back was one of the
strongest confutations of the plague scare
that that exploded bogle ever received.
The State Board cf Health did not seem
pleased to see the plague bugaboo melt
away under the light of Dr. Mouser'a
science iirni In effect refused to repose
in the it-port which they themselves hau
called lor the conniei-ce that it destxved.
emanating an it did frum a man who id
pronounced one of the foremost American
bacteriologists of to-day. The State
Board of Health In fact occupies an aÂ»u
ward position, the flimsy curtain of an
executive session with which it tried to
conceal the report having- been torn away.
I>r. Winslow Anderson, the new member
of the StiLte board, when set?n last night,
Â¦was at first embarrassed and then waxed
wroth over the fact that the na-ture of
l>r Mouser'E report had been revealed.
"I have nothing- to fcay for the public."
said Dr. Anderson. "The board met in
executive session. It is no business of the
public's what took place at that meeting.
My own feelings in the matter are the
prime to-day bs -when I concurred frith
Governor Gape's finding of June 14. Dr.
Mouser I reg-ard as one of the greatest
bacteriologists in America. His opinion
should be law on such a subject. >Â«"o, I
cannot say anything further on the re
port yet. The board has not finished its
:::\ e-tipations in Chinatown."
â¢"Theu the board does not accept Dr.
Mouser's opinion as final?" was asked.
"That I cannot eay. The matter is un
der advisement. I cannot say what will
I - ihe outcome. How soon will the Inves
tigation be completed? In about two
... >ntbs. I should ?ay. No, I will say no
more the subject; It is no business of
tho public?
Dr. Si!as Mouser's report fills three
donelv typewritten foolscap sheets of
technical matter and deals with the bu
bonic scare in terms that leave no room
for doubt- as to the expert's opinion. The
report, after detailing- the analysis of the j
F< rmr <.>f tÂ«o bubonic Â«ui-p#ct!, states
That the cause of death was certainly :

MAKES EXPERIMENT
EXPERT SAYS
THERE WAS NO
PLAGUE HERE
State B(rrd of Health Tries
Hard to Suppress His
Report.
Mrs. Bessie Smith was not -allowed to
enter the Townsend home yesterday to
point out the secret panel behind which
it is believed the last will of Mra. Almira
S. Townsend may be found. Judge Dunne
yesterday morning denied Hugo Asher's
petition for an order of court giving Mrs.
Smith the authority to enter the lata
home of the dead philanthropist. Judge
Dunne'a refusal to srant the order was
based on the lack of tangible evidence
necessary to prove that a will existed.
After Judge Dunne had denied the motion
Attorney Sullivan, representing AIr3. Mur
ray, said that neither he nor hia client
had any objections to Judge Paterson
and Samuel Shortridge making a. thorough
search oi the Calllornt^-street house and
that he (Sullivan) was prepared to ac
company them and assist them In their
search. But. he added, to Mrs. Smith's
presence in the Townsend home there
were decided objections.
Before, however. Emerson and Short
ridge could accept Judge Sullivan's ofter
they declared it was nrst necessary to
consult with Mrs. Smith and to learn
from her the exact location of the secret
panel. Accordingly Asher, Paterson,
Shortridge and Pippy went down to tnÂ»*
Appraiser^ building aiÂ»d had a long in
terview with the lady, but Mrs. Smith's
description of where the secret panel was
to be found was not considered oy Shurt
ridge ana Paterion definite enougn to
assure their locating it without the lady's
assistance. Therefore the attorneys re
fused to avail themselves of Sullivan's
otter and decided to make to-day a more
formal application for an order to search
the Townsend home.
"It is tnis way," said Judge Paterson.
"Mrs. Smith explained distinctly in what
room an<I what place that secret panel
was, but no amount of explanation and
directions wouid enable us to go directly
to the spot. To hunt around for the
panel would simply give the inmates of
ihe house a clow of where it was to be
found anu that we do not propose to do."
"Judge Sullivan's obiectit;ns to Mrs.
Smith amounts to just this much." ex
plained Hugo Asher. "He is afraid that snÂ«
might drop a posthumous will in that
house of mystery. We have offered that
Mrs. Smith bo searched before visiting
the house." continued Mr. Asher. and then
tf Judge Sullivan wishes it. to have her
tied up in a sack with her hands secured
behind her back, and in that fashion have
her carried into the house."
"My objection to having Mrs. Smith visit
the Townsend home ts simply this," said
Judge Sullivan last evening. "She is ex
tremely distasteful to my client. Mrs.
Smith and Mrs. Town?end had been
friends, but in the last days of Mrs.
Townsend's life they became estranged."
"I, objectionable to Mrs. Murray."
said Mrs. Smith, when she was asked to
explain why Mrs. Townsend's daughter
had no kindly feeling for the woman who
for so many years was her mother's
friend. "I cannot understand it all. It
is Miss Rattipan'a doings. I see the Rat
tipran hand through it all.
"Miss Rattitcan had a strange influence
over Mrs. Townsend," Mrs. Smith went
on to explain, "and she finally managed
to keep her away from all her old friends.
Toward the end she even tried to preju
dice her against Hie. When Mrs. Tov.n
send was making all this public display,
giving entertainments in honor of the
soldiers, etc.. I took her aside and told her
she was being criticized. Miss Rattlprnn,
however, flattered her and told her that
I was not sincere. That is all that ever
came between me and Mrs. Townsend."
While the attorneys for the absent
heirs and the attorneys for Joseph Coburn
and the legal representative of Mrs. Mur
ray are holding: forth what they can and
will do. Attorney fJunzendorffer. the lejral
representative of Thomas Townsend. the
divorced husband of the late philanthro
pist. 1? keeping quiet as to Just what hl3
client is poinsr to do.
"I have nothiner so far for publication."
said Gunzendorffer yesterday. "In a few
days we shall be ready to explain what
we" intend to do. and our plans will cause
not a little sensation."
When the application for letters of ad
ministration are heard next week Asher
will oppose the appointment of Mrs. Mur
ray on the ground that she is not a resi
dent of this State. The attorneys for Mrs.

Two Themes That Are Exploited in
MORALS IN SOCIETY
AND IN BUSINESS
In this connection a Ptory was told to
day by a man who has a national reputa
tion as a labor leader and who is now a
power among the employes of railroads.
This man was considering the grievances
of the men on an important line previous
to consultation with the company's repre
sentative. One day he was approached by
the agent of a man who Is well known to
aspire to a seat in the Senate from his
State, one of the central western group.
This agent without any preliminary tnlk
said that he had understood the employes
of the road under consideration had many
"Early in the spring." he said. "It was
learned that the leaders of the Republican
party were greatly worried because of at
tempts being made to incite strikes in
different parts Of the country.
"We were given warning and were a
trifle more watchful in consequence."
From one Intimately connected with the
management of the New York Central it
was learned to-day that for a time there
was much fear the men would listen to
the voice of the agitators.
So much impressed were tho Republican
leaders with the danger that threatened
them that they caused to be sent to all
the heads of the great railway systems a
friendly notice that an organized attempt
would probably be made to create discon
tent among their employes.
NEW YORK. July 30.â The Herald says:
Practical confirmation was obtained to
day of the report that certain partisans of
William J. Bryan, hoping to Improve the
chances of his election, have attempted to
precipitate strikes and kindred disorders.
Could such a condition be produced as ex
isted in 18f'2 after the Homestead riots, It
is believed the labor vote would be cast
for Bryan.

GARFIELD PARK
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, July 30.âSenator Hanna
and Governor Roosevelt had a hot time
at Republican headquarters this morning.
Mr. Hanna took Roosevelt to task for a
speech delivered on July 17 before the
convention of the National League of Re
publican Clubs in St. Paul. The Republi
can rational campaign managers have
been much worried over Democratic at-:
tacks upon the speech, which represent
the Governor as havJng declared that all
Democrats were malefactors and cowards.
Governor Roosevelt appeared at head
quarters in the morning and rushed down
the corridor asking eagerly where Sena
tor Hanna's room whs. As soon as ho
entered all doors leading to other rooms
were locked and nobody was admitted
while they were together.
The Governor found Senator Hanna di
vested of his coat, waistcoat, collar and
cuffs and up to his elbows in work.
Governor Roosevelt had not seen the
attacks upon the speech and he was
astounded when he heard of the interpre
tation which had been put upon it. He
answered Senator Hanna, banging his fist
upon the table for emphasis, that he had
never accused all Democrats of coward
ice. He declared that he had been totally
misrepresented and he insisted that a
newspaper containing a stenographic re
port of his speech should be sent for so
that Senator Hanna could see for himself
what he had said.
When the paper was brought the Gover
nor and Senator Hanna read that portion
of the speech which furnished the busi*
for the criticisms.
When Hanna saw that the Governor had
Included only the Kansas City platform
Democrats In his accusation of lawless
ness, disorder and cowardice and that
words could not reasonably be applied to
Admiral Dewey and General Wheeler his
face cleared. He decided that the best
way to meet the attacks upon the speech
would be to print it as a campaign docu
ment and let it speak for itself. â¢ .

INDIANAPOLIS, July 30.âTho commit-

lie then said that the national adminis
tration is opposed to the workinsman and
disposed to favor In every way corpora
tions.
For this reason, if for no other. Demo
crats would champion the cause of labor.
He then made a proposition that the day
the strike was ordered on the road a con
tribution Of $100,000 would be made to tho
treasury fund of the strike. Furthermore
a monthly contribution would be made,
the size of which would be sufficient to en
ablft the payment of strike benefits. The
proposition was not given a moment's con
sideration and the man who made it was
told there had never been a prospect of
a strike.
This story was vouched for by the man
to whom the proposition was made.

murderer is considered most probable. The
small outbuildings are distant from the I
residence several hundred feet, and the ;
chicken, shed, which went up in flames, ;
was in a gulch through which the pre- !
vailing winds blow toward the residence, j
Every phase of the investigation only
tended to more clearly demonstrate the
correctness of the murder theory.
Wheeler Bayle.<=s, a son who resides at
Market and Lydia streets, in Oakland, |
was one of the three who went immedl- i
ately to the scene when news of the
father's death reached Oakland. He has
returned convinced that the old man was
assassinated, after being driven out by j
the burning of the house. :
"I have made arrangements to return j
to Glencoe soon." said Mr. Bayless to-day, Â¦
"to continue the search for my father's I
murderer, for there is no doubt that he j
was foully Plain by an enemy who. I be- j
lieve. intended to burn him to death, but j
having failed in that* shot the poor old |
man down while he was trying to save
some of his stock.
"The footprints, so carefully traced,
tell the story. They were followed as if ;
the murderer himself had left description |
of his movements that nierht. My father i
occupied a room on <he first floor in the
front of the house, which faced diagonally
the ranch road. At the corner across the
front was undoubtedly where the fire
started. I am convinced that the mur-
derer intended to sacrifice my father in
the flames he started first, but seeing that
the old man escaped, ran to the barn and
set that afire. Then he got the rifle and
ran back to wait his chance.
"If the body had not been so badly
burned, the evidence would surely have
been found. It mlpht have been discov
ered anyway, but the Coroner buried the
remains without making a proper exami
nation. The head was gone completely.
The old man's body was a Rood target
with the background of briRht flames.
"Of course, there is a suspicion. My
father had enemies, but I am in no posi
tion now to pive names. The authorities
of Calaveras County have all the informa
tion possible to give on the subject. I fear
greatly that the wretch will never be
brought to justice, because of the destruc
tion of the evidence which might convict
him."
The ranch upon which Bayless met his
end was purchased by htm with a por
tion of the treasure he and several em
ploves unburied beneath a house at Tenth
and Grove streets ten years ago. Gold
worth $87,000 was taken from a hiding
place where it was buried, it is supposed,
by a thieving coiner of the United States
Mint. Bayless' widow and surviving
children still reside in this city. They
were> making preparations to visit the
ranch when news of the death came to
them.

avcras County supposedly through j
the arcMr-ntal burning: of his new house, j
was. in reality, it is now firmly believed,
foully murdered by an assassin, who had
first lired the house In hope that the old
man would be burned to death.
Such is the story revealed by the
searching Investigation which the sons of
the lirad man. assisted by the authorities j
<-f C_l_ver_* County, hav*- made of the j
trapio finding of th-Mr father's charred
body on the ranch near Oloncoe.
In the nre which destroyed Rayless" j
residence and farm buildings during the {
morning of July 19 the unknown murderer '
expected to wipe out all traces of a foul j
and mysterious homicide, which has so
far baffled the closest probing for a clew i
to the assassin's Identity. Enemies the i
â¢ Â¦Id man had. but at whom the finger of j
suspicion can be pointed is yet to be dis- ;
closed. The children of the dead mar.
have vowed to make ceaseless effort to I
uncover the dark mystery and not a de- j

way- all mark the trail of the midnipht i
assassin so clearly that none who saw '<
th*' mute evidence could say aught but
that a double crime ha.d been committed ;

The Sheriff of Â« alaveras County and the i
Constables and Deputy Sheriffs of the !
<>!encoe district have :n band every fea- \
Lure of the mystery and not one move is i
being overlooked that might lift the veil ;
from the mystery surrounding the aged 1
OMklandor's death.
On the morning of July 13 neighbors dis- 1
covered the resifotHv, a large two-story j
building, in ashe". A shed several nun"- I
fired feot distant had also been destroyed. >
In the place where had been the doorway !
of the burned barn the body of Ray less i
was found. It was all but consumed in i
the fire.
When the officers reached the scene they
found in the yard near the dwelling two
bureau drawers of clothing, some blan- â¢

two horsos therr. because they were found
loose on the place. From the way his
body lay it would seem that he fell back

In tho skoWon of hi* hand was _ bunch
of iron from harne-sp. The body was on

wore human footprints. Indicating that
the rancher had been shot as he emerged
from the barn and that his body fell into

And the trail of footprints that the sons
and the Sheriff found tell the story. There
Is a road branching to tho Bayless place
from the Glencoe road. The trail of steps
was first taken up on the ranch road and
followed to a corner of the burned house,
thence to the rear of the barn. Then they
were retraced back to the little pile of
household poods. There the assassin, bo
the marks read, picked up Bayless' rifle,
and walked down to a point opposite the
barn entrance. The rifle shell wa? suf
rounded by the same indistinct prints,
which were traced back again to the
ranch road, then down to a field that sep
arates it from the Glencoe road and
further across the road and into the

Booth on April 8. ISM. He worked steadily
there until May 4, 1900. On that day he
lert the mill and was In Paterson but
seldom afterward. On May 22 last he
sailed on the French liner Havre for
Europe. Where he spent the intervening
time Is not known.
â¢ Among the better class of Italians noth
ing but words of regret were heard to-day
over the killing of King Humbert. A lead
ing merchant of Paterson, who admitted
that his reason for not wanting his name
mentioned was that he feared the anar
chists and the Mafia, said he hoped t>ie
murder of the King would lead all nations
to take vigorous steps to stamp out the
organization. He said no one's life was
safe if he incurred the enmity of any man
In the organization. In discussing Bressl
he said he believed there had not been a
drawing, but that Cariboni had been
vouched for by Bressl, that Cariboni had
weakened and Bressi had to take his
place and Cariboni kill himself.
Paterson has long been a hotbed of
anarchists. Men here who were familiar
more 'or less with the workings of the
organization pay that for years Paterson
has contained more of the society than
any other city in the United States, with
the possible exception of Chicago. There
is a ftrong socialist element in Paterson.
and the anarchists formerly worked with
this clement.
" The anarchists tried to control the so
cialists, and failing dropped away "from
the movement and denounced the social
ists because of their peacefulness * and
claimed that they were traitors, although
the socialists had never tried anything
but peaceful methods and were purely
political and law-abiding. The anarchists
embraced every strike in Paterson for a
long time as a means of fomenting trouble
ana during the great silk strike three
years ago^-the strike which drove the silk
Industry to locate factories, in different
parts of the countryâ the anarchists did
more than air else to bring about the
removal of the manufacturers. They used
dynamite, and although their efforts to
destfoy factory buildings were frustrated
they created such a feeling of uneasiness
that the manufacturers withdrew.
When the Empress of Austria. was mur
dered the local anarchists had a'big,cele
bration, but not openly. When the news
came they slipped out of the city and as
sembled at a prearranged point, when
they held their jollification, and when it
was over returned to Paterson. As they

Official Reports Received FTom Cap
tains of the Revenue Cutters
Bsar and Manning.
WASHINGTON. July 30.â The official re
ports of Captain Tuttle of the revenue
cutter Bear, dated July 6, at Nome City,
Alaska, and of Captain Roberts of tlir*
revenue cutter Manning, dated July 14. at
Dutch Harbor, have been received at the
Treasury Department.
Captain Tuttle reports an epidemic of
measles and pneumonia at Slnecock, Po-t
Clarence, Cape York and Cape Prince of
Wales. In concluding Captain Tuttle
says:
"The situation along the whole coast I
regard as very serious. It is estimated
that at present there are within a radius
(taking the United States Postoffice as a
center) of ten miles 25,000 people. Moct
of them are living In tents on the beach.
"The sanitary condition of the portion
of the city where houses have been erect
ed is fimply frightful. Typhoid fever is
raging and smallpox steadily gaining. All
possible efforts are being made to stamp
out the smallpox, but with so many thou
sands of tents, scattered over miles of ter
ritory, it is impossible for the health au
thorities to keep track of ail cases. As
nearly as can be traced the disease WT3
introduced by the steamer Oregon.
Afterward the steamers Ohio and Santa
Ana were found to be infected and were
placed In quarantine. The Oregon ha*l
left before her cases were discovered.
General Randall is commanding with a
firm hand and having troops at his dis
posal will maintain order until such time
as civil government Is organized. I un
derstand the natives all along the Siberian
coast are suffering from influenza and
pneumonia and not disposed to trade for
reindeer at present."

(All efforts to communicate with Grass Valley or Nevada City by wire or tele
phone proved futile and the extent of the fire could not be ascertained at 2 a. m.
NEVADA CITY, July 31, 1 a. m.â The glare of a large fire in the direction
of Grass Valley is distinctly visible here. Nothing has been heard from Gra^ss
Valley.
(At this point the telephone wire.refused to work and the supposition is that
the office has been destroyed, thus Interrupting communication with Grass Val
ley and Nevada City.)
GRASS VALLEY, July 31, 12:30 a, m. (By telephone to Associated Press).â At
midnight fire was discovered in a large livery stable near the telephone exchange.
The fire looks threatening and there is danger of a big conflagration.
BIG FIRE RAGING
IN GRASS VALLEY
According to late reports at Skaguay
the steamer Florence S, which was
wrecked in Thirty-mile River on July 20,
turned turtle because of a heavy shipment
of machinery on her main deck shifting.
The steamer is said to have been running
fast when she left White Horse, a short
time before, in the hope of keeping ahead
of another steamer that was to try to
make a record. trip to Dawson. The other
steamer followed four hours later and
picked up the survivors of the wreck,
numbering thirty, who had made shore.
Nothing has been seen of the bodies of
the three persons drowned. Mrs. Stuart
and daughter of Victoria and Jack Mc-
Cabe of Portland, the steward of the boat.
On July 31 the Lake Bennett section of
the White Pass and Yukon Railroad will
be completed, and from then on through
trains will be run from Skaguay to White
Horse. The completion of the road will
result in the deserting of Bennett City,
so long the poiat for thousands of Klon
dikers. It will become merely a by-sta
tion on the railroad. Already people are
flocking to the new terminus of the line,
and many of the big warehouses which
were doing a rushing business a short
time ago at Bennett have been torn down
and transferred to White Horse.
SEATTLE, July 30.â Fifty Klondikers
and Dawson advices to July 20 came in on
the City of Topefca, which arrived to-day
from Skaguay and Juneau. The Topeka's
treasure exceeded $300,000. She had a num
ber of rich Klondike operators aboard:

BLOEMFONTEIN, July 30.â General Hunter, having received a written un
conditional surrender of all the Boers in Calcdon Valley, attended to ac
cept the surrender. General Prinsloo. lately elected to the chief command,
arrived and tried to repudiate the unconditional surrender. General Hunter,
however, refused any concessions.except to allow the Boers to keep one rid
ing horse.
About 11 o'clock the troops were drawn up in two long lines on the hills and
over the valley acd the Boers rode between, throwing down their rifles, to
gether with a "motley collection of clothlnp, blankets and scar, such as was found
In General Qronje'a laager.
The Ficksburg commando was the first to lay down arms, consisting of about
550 men. Then came the Ladybrand commando with about 430. Fifteen horses,
two jyjns and fifty wagons were given up. General Prinsloo and Commandant
Crbwlher were received by General Hunter at his tent, where they were well
treated and accorded every courtesy. <Â«.
Many of the Doers have gone through Nauuwpoort and will surrender to
General MacDonald. Others are still arriving here. The Harrismith and Vrede
commandoes are yet at large, as well as some Boers who erot out of the valley at
r.fght. but the prisoners say that those outside will â¢ surrender and this will prac
tically end the Free State army.
The Boers say they would not have surrendered had they not been surrounded.
The prisoners have been placed in a laager under guard and will be kept there
until all arrive.

WAR ON THE RANGE.
THE war on the fice range on'the public domain
has opened and is worse than ever. Wyoming
sheep men have been driven out of Colorado by
the cattle men, and many thousands of their sheep
have been slaughtered. The herders were warned not
to cross the line again under penalty of death. In
Wyoming a mining district has been opened where
there was sheep range and a* large camp has sprung
up. This appearance of the miners, and assertion oi
their rights under the mineral laws of the land, did not
suit the herders, and they visited the camp and pro
ceeded to "shoot up the town." No deaths resulted,
but the miners were for the time terrorized. They
are now arming and making ready to assert their
rights, anjJ a battle is expected.
Since April more than a score of unlawful acts of
a serious nature have occurred between parties en
joying common use of the public domain ag a stock
range. The "reason is that as the grass is destroyed
by overstocking, the competition for.it grows keener
and, as the range is free to all. the strongest and best
armed and md?t desperate hold it against the weak or
timid. All join in denying to the miner and locator
their rights under the law.
The remedy for this annual state of warfare on the
ranges, as The has often pointed out, is in* a
properly guarded leasehold law, which will respect
the rights of all and compel each to respect the rights
of others. At the same time such a lawiwill promote
the regrassing-of the ranges and give a desirable per
manence to the grazing business.

PERSONAL MENTION.
The people of the interior must be on guard as
vigilantly as are the loyal Republicans of this city,
or they will find that the legislators who stood firmly
for the interests of the people and for honest politics
in the Legislature will be sacrificed at the command of
the corporation whose corrupt schemes they defeated.
One good turn deserves another. The men who i.i
ofiice supported the people should now be supported
by the people in the campaign.
The schemes of the corporation and the Mint
saloon bosses are very well understood in this city,
and the better elem-nts of the Republican party are
on guard against thÂ«m. It is well known here that if
the combine can have its way loyal Republicans will
be set aside in every Assembly and Senatorial district
and such men as Wolfe and Dibble be nominated.
A similar game is to be played elsewhere. The defeat
of Robinson. Belshaw and Lardner would mean the
nomination of men of the Dibble and Wolfe type. It
is true the corporation coulfl hardly dig up in the
Third, Fifth and Eleventh Senatorial districts candi
dates quite a match for the two pliant tools that
serve its purposes here, but it will at least get men
who will obey the railroad, no matter what it may
command them to do.
WHEN* the political managers of the Southern
Pacific Comply found they could not force
the election of Dan Burns to the United States
Senate they retired from the contest admitting defeat
but vowing vengeance on those who defeated them.
That vow they are now trying to keep. They have
nursed it carefully and kept it warm. It is active to
day in animating the sailroad bosses in the work they
are doing in the campaign. Xot only in this city but,
throughout the State they are laying plans and form
ing combinations with local bosses for the purpose of
controlling the nomination of legislative candidates.
They have two objects in view. One is that of de
feating now .the men who defeated Burns for the
Senate, and the other that of fixing the electoral dis
tricts of the State for the next ten ye^rs. The per
sonal spite of the managers and the political interests
c! the corporation ar; thus to be served by the one
act of driving honest Republicans from office, and. ac
cordingly, the plan U being pushed forward with ail
the force and with j-11 the cunning the railroad
schemers possess. â¢
Among the men agcinst whom the combination of
corporation and local bosses is fighting with special
\indictiveness are three who were distinguished by
their zeal in defending the interests of the people and
the honor of Republicanism in the fight against
Burns. These are the Hon. W. S. Robinson, an as
pirant for the Senate in the Third Senatorial Dis
trict: Hon. C. M. Belshaw, in the Eleventh Senatorial
District, and Hon. W. B. Lardner, in the Fifth Sena
torial District. If the corporation managers can de
feat these men and elect in place of them three pliant
tools of the railroad they will have a big victory to
brag about in their reports to Huntington. They
will have kept out of office three men who are known
to be faithful guardians of .the public interests, and in
place of them will have men who will not only vots
with the corporation in establishing the Assembly,
Senatorial and Congressional districts this winter, but
will hold over and have a vote in the election of a
United States Senator to succeed Perkins. Such a
triumph would be a big one lor the gang, and accord
ingly their political Boxers are out in force under
orders to spare no one who stands up for genuine
Republicanism and honest politics.
THE SOUTHERN PACIFIC AT WORK.
In the meantime the discussion over what is to be
done in South Africa goes briskly forward. The Min
istry has as yet given no statement of what it purposes
to do, but many Liberals are demanding that as soon
as possible South Africa be treated like Australia,
formed into a federation, the Transvaal be given
self-government as an integral part of it. Speaking
for the Liberals, the Westminster Gazette recently
said: "We want an Africa which, like Australia, shall
manage its own internal affairs by statesmanship and
not by .bloodshed, which shall be responsible for
keeping order within its own boundaries, which shall
make no difference between men of different blood,
and which, if it eliminates thelimperial factor, shall
at the same time strengthen the, imperial tie. The
Downing-streetism which lies immediately ahead of
The opponents of dissolution object on the ground
that it would be taking snap judgment. In their esti
mation the country is not at this time prepared to
vote upon either the Chinese or the Transvaal
problem. They argue that a Parliament elected this
year would be made up of all kinds of enthusiasts car
ried away by the war feeling, and that it could not be
relied upon to furnish a Ministry with a reliable
majority for any great length of time. In fact, some
Conservatives declare that if a dissolution take place
this summer the public will regard it as a political
trick designed by the Ministry to get a new lease of
power by means of the war spirit, and therefore that
it will hurt the party rather than help.
The argument for dissolution is further strength
ened by the outbreak of the disturbance in China. A
British Ministry, as all the world knows, depends for
place and power upon Parliament, and when a Min
istry has behind it only a dying Parliament, one with
but a short time to Jive, it is clear it cannot act with
much force. The Chinese troubles are going to last
a long time, and accordingly it is urged that there
should be called the election of, a new Parliament,
which would have before it the long term of life re
quired to sustain a Ministry through the whole course
of the Chinese controversy.
The sentiment favorable Â¦ to dissolution is 'not
wholly of a partisan nature, though of course it is
stronger in certain Tory circles than among the Lib
erals. The days of the present Parliament are rap
idly running out, and if there be no general election
this year one will have to take place next year. At
the present time the Conservatives are in a good posi
tion. They have carried on a war which has roused
the patriotism of the people, and the Ministry natur
ally gets the benefit of it. On the other hand, the
Liberals are divided on the South African question.
Some of them are as ardent imperialists as Chamber
lain himself, while others are so much opposed to the
whole business they would withdraw the British
troops from the Transvaal and give the Boers, if not
complete independence, at least a large degree of self
government.
Wf HILE we are going along with offr Presiden
tial campaign the British are speculating upon
the expediency of having a general election of
their own this year. There is a strong sentiment in
favor of an immediate dissolution of Parliament in
order that an appeal may be taken to the cquntry on
the issues arising out of the war in South Africa, and
a Government put into power with sufficient length ol
office before it to be able to carry out whatever policy
the country supports.
A DISSOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT.
British Liberals have at last attacked Colonial Sec
retary Joseph Chamberlain in what appears to be his
only vital spot. A determined effort is being made
tto reduce his salary.
Marin County has a citizen who has been in jail
sixty times for stealing chickens, and since each im
prisonment costs something, it would have been
cheaper for the taxpayers to have supplied him with a
chicken ranch at the start.
Xot content with their mines of coal and iron, the
people of Tennessee claim to have found in their State
a gold mine with ore assaying $400 to the ton; but as
yet they do not claim thar it can be scooped up with
a shovel, so Cape Xcme will continue to hold the
crowd.
Kaiser William's ordtr to his troops to take no pris
oners when fighting in Chin^ will doubtless have the
effect of preventing other nations from consenting to
let a German have supreme command in the cam
paign. The Russian and the Jap pretensions in that
direction have been already vetoed. It may come our
way yet.
THE ASSASSINATION OF HUMBERT.
BY the assassination [of King Humbert of Italy the
anarchists have added another to that fearful list
of murders with which in the last decade they
have staggered humanity. Their deeds are the more
appalling because there appears no sure way to guard
against them. The fanatic devotee who is not only
willing to perish in an effort to kill a selected victim,
but actually courts such death as a sort of martyrdom,
is a foe to be dreaded by the whole civilized world.
That fear of detection and sure punishment that re
strains the impulses of ordinary criminals is utterly
unknown to the thugs of anarchy. The only way to
prevent their blow is to keep 'far beyond their reach.
Nothing else will avail. King Humbert was at a fes
tival surrounded by thousands of loyal and loving
people, a" small retinue of royal guards was about
him, but in that publicity, with a full certainty that ar
rest and death to himself would follow at once, the
wretched scoundrel struck him and the King fell.
Such an assassination is not to be confounded with
tyrannicide, for Humbert was a constitutional King
and was in no sense tyrannical or harsh. On the con
trary, he was one of the best loved rulers in the world
and fully merited the esteem of all men. His per
sonal courage was not only equal to the duties of his
station, but was of that high and shining quality that
makes a hero and compels the admiration of all men.
It was^shown in a noble way when the King, leaving
his summer palace in the mountains, went down to
the plague-stricken city of Naples and by his personal
presence in the hospitals a*nd in the most pestilential
quarters of the city calmed the panic-stricken people
and restored to them the serene courage and confi
dence needed to fight the plague and conquer it. It
has long been the proud motto of his house, "Savoy
and fear have never met," but not in all the illustrious
line of bis ancestry was there ever given a sublimcr
proof of it than by Humbert during the dread days of
the Naples pestilence.
In addition to the quality of a truly heroic courage,
Humbert had many of the traits that make men lov
able to their fellow-men. He was honest, generous
and good-natured. He liked his people and delighted
to share in all their aspirations and even in their
sports. It was after a visit to a grand gymnasium
where he had distributed prizes to the winners in the
athletic games that he was killed. Thus there was
nothing in his public or his private life that could
have aroused against him the rage of a right-thinking
man. His death was murder in its most hideous form,
the wanton, cruel, causeless, mad act of a man out of
whose heart and brain all humanity had gone, leaving"
nothing but a brute^animated by a hell-born hate.
Out of the terrible act the civilized world will draw
one more portentous lesson of the menace which our
civilization has bred in its own womb and in some
inscrutable way is nursing into vigor. Anarchy is the
outcome of civilized society of our time. It is not
a barbarian, nor a savage product. China breeds the
Boxer, a creature full of barbaric rage and brutal lust
of blood, but at the same time one who has some
method in his madness. Asia has no anarchists.
Europe alone is the breeding-ground of that terror,
and her statesmen know not how to deal with. him.
He know? how to make use of all weapons, from the
dynamite bomb to the crude dagger formed of a
sharpened file with which the Empress of Austria was
stabbed; he knows how to strike and he is not afraid
to die. At present he strikes only at kings or states
men. Later on he may strike at others, and then the
struggle between society and anarchy will be on in
earnest.

BROTHER OFFICERS," presented
at the Columbia Theater last night,
is a loosely constructed three-act
tragri-comedy with one good scene
In the flrst act for Mr. Miller and
another in the last act for Mr. Steven".
The rest of the play is what mighi be
called "lilling-in" of the most ordinary
description, wherein the filling consists of.
society chatter, proofs of tailoring, an
overheard conversation and a love scene
drawn out exceedingly thin.
John Hinds has risen from the ranks in
the British army and has become an offi
cer in a fashionable regiment, the First
Lancers. The placing of this son of the
people in an environment that does not
harmonize with his birth and breeding
gives Mr. Miiler the scene to which i
have referred. He excellently Improves
his opportunity; the bashfulness and mod
esty of a man truly courageous the tim
idity which changes into sudden and un
fortunate social overconfldence, the gen
iality which leads to an almost tatal
gaucnerleâ all these were given to the
life in Mr. Miller's very best vein.
Edwin Stevens as -Robert Hutton, the
Australian swindler, showed a capacity
for character acting which should forever
make it impossible for him to return to
the common paths of Tivoli burlesque. It
was not due to his fault, but to the.
author's poverty of imagination that he 1
was foiled by the mechanical device of a
tattoo mark on his breast. His cleverness
and self-possession really entitled him to
the victory. He was, as Mr. Shakespeare
says, a most eomparativest, rascaliest,
sweetest imp, and when he left the stage
the light and glory of the scene departed
with him.
Mr. Morgan played an uninteresting
part in a manner both indistinct and
stagy, throwing many of his speeches
into the wings and confiding others to
the privileged few who sat within twenty
feet of the stage. Mansfield, in his most
supercilious mood, was' never worse than
this.
Miss Dale and Mr. Courtenay played the.
peeond lovers with charming ease and
gayety. while Miss Anglin, in the serious
part of the heroine, showed a charm of
manner which is as satisfying as it is
rare.
To sum up: A crude little play, re
deemed by two or three excellent scenes
and by same delightfully delicate acting.

Tivoli.
Last nlpht saw the opening of the grand
opera season at the Tivoli Opera-house
with Verdi's "Aida." and a rarely en
thusiastic audience It was that greeted
the initial appearance of the favorites of
last year. Salassa and Avedano. and Anna
Lichter, Frances Graham and William
Schuster, more familiarly dear to the
musical clientele of the Tivoli.

Grand Opera-house.
"The Great Ruby"',was presented for
the last time at the Grand Opera-house
last night. The auditorium was filled with
members of the Woodmen of the'World
and their ladies, who seemed to thorough

drama. Between the acts little Hazel

California.
Dunne & Ryley, presenting Matthews
and Bulger In the comic operetta, "By
the Sad Sea Waves," furnished much ma
terial for laughter at the California last
evening, as they will do the remainder of
the week. Mary Marble, as Sis Hopkins,
won the audience with her fetching: little
sketch, "The Hoo-do-doo-do Man," and
her song, "Yankee Reuben Glue." was re
ceived not less popularly. Norma Whal

cupied a conspicuous place during tha
performance. Her style and voice show
renewed study, her rendition of "Tha

trie interpretation of simple roles. Mlsa
Ethel Kirwan, "she of the wedding break

Miss Kirwan has as yet made no pretensa

Matthews and Bulger, well seconded by
Tony Hart, furnished much of the even
ing's apusement and at the fall of the
curtain their last sally made plain the fact
that stored away they have material to
round out the week's fun.
Alcazar.
- One of Shakespeare's strongest stories
of ,love and death. "Romeo and Juliet."
was presented at the Alcazar Theater last
evening by the regular company, with
Misa Florence Roberts impersonating the
heroine and White Whlttlesey as RomÂ«-o.
This is not the first time the popular little
actress has appeared as Juliet, and her
conception of the part is manifest by her
splendid acting. She showed to the best
advantage in the deep, emotional scenes
which conclude the tragedy.
The audience, which was large, appre
ciated her work, and Mr. Whlttlesey also
received several recalls. Miss Marie
Howe as the nurse is also deserving of
praise for some very clever acting. Edwin
T. Emery as Mercutio. Carlisle Moore as
Paris. C. F. Montaine as Capulet. Ernest
Howell as Benvolio, George P. Webster as
Tybalt and Howard Scott as the apoth
ecary were liberally applauded. In fact,
the whole company waa well received. The
stage sevinga and electric lig-ht effects are
appropriate and pretty.
On account of a demand for a continu
ance ftf "The Country Oirl" that piece
will be placed on the hoards next week,
beginning August 6. "The Country Oirl"
is to tÂ»e foHowed by "Frou Frou," and "A

us reverses all these conditions, and, to that extent,

Whatever be the weight of the arguments on ths
one side or the other, it' is evident a strong body of
the British people are very eager to have a vote on
the South African question. They are not willing to
leave it wholly in the hands of the presrnt Parliament.
They may not be sufficiently strong to force a disso
lution at once, but they are strong enough to make
a good fight for it and they are doing it. Thus the
Edinburgh Scotsman says: "Let the business of Par
liament, already in a forward state, be promptly
wound up, and let thefdissolution come at latest by
the end of the present month. That is the sensible
course. It is also the most prudent course, not, as
Lord Crewe insinuates, in the interests of the Gov
ernment, but in the interests of the empire."
BREAKING FROM BRYAN.
S~* OLONEL BRYAN'S second campaign is still
I in its honeymoon and seems to be lagging.
So far not a Democratic paper in the United
States has defended those features of the platform
which project the issues of 1896. The St. Paul Globe,
Boston v Herald, Baltimore Sun and Baltimore News
all bolt and bolt hard. The Atlanta . Constitution,
which was one of the Southern papers most respon
sible for the Chicago platform heresies, is more than
lukewarm, it is wavering.
The Observer of Charlotte) N. C, bolts Bryan
squarely and will have none of him or his ways. It
says: "The reaffirmation of the Chicago platform in
general terms would have been bad enough, but its
two most obnoxious features were singled out and
emphasized by indorsing free silver and denouncing
injunctions and the courts."
The Times, Richmond, Va., says: "This'substitu
tion of Bryan's personal views for the principles. of
the Democratic party dissolves the bonds of the
Democratic party in a way they have never been dis
solved before."
In the South the Galveston News, Chattanooga
Times and Knoxville Banner are all talking the same
way, and in the North the Hartford Times, New
Haven Register,. Manchester Union, Providence
Journal, Utica- Obseiver, Albany Argus, Brooklyn
Eagle and Philadelphia Record follow suit. In effect
they join in the declaration that the silver plank "still
makes it impossible to elect the Democratic candi
date."
The Baltimore Sun, long the leading -paper of its
section and one of the ablest in the country, says:
'"Eighty per cent of the delegates to the Kansas City
convention were willing to drop the silver issue, but
Mr. Bryan insisted upon a specific declaration, played
into the hands of his political enemies, impaired his
chances and gave the Republicans the opportunity
they desired by his dictatorial and blundering insist
ence."
Speaking as an atyi-expansionist, Hon. J. Sterling
Morton, in his Conservative, after reviewing Bryan's
inconsistent record on expansion, says: "Why, then,
should those who oppose militarism and imperialism
prefer the election of Bryan over McKinley? As the
record of neither can be indorsed from the standpoint
of the anti-imperialist, would it not be better to aid
in electing the one whose position on the currency
question is sound, and whose election Would not en
danger the business stability of the country?"
That seems to be about the conclusion reached by
a majority of the Gold Democrats. It was expected
that Colonel Bryan would receive large accessions
from their ranks. But instead he suffers a bolt from
the silver side, which is so general North and South,
it the papers mean a.nything. as to indicate a more
general defection than that of four years ago.
We believe that this collapse of Bryan's campaign
and party is full of peril for the Republican party if
that party permit itself to fall under the truncheons
of bosses and blackguards. The spirit of consecration
should be upon every Republican in the presence of
that awful responsibility which is implied in the con
fidence of a free people. It is not only to win this
year, but to win worthily, and by wise use of the
power that comes with victory to establish the foun
dations of public liberty and general prosperity where
they will be safe from assault

In Its service that he made his last voy
ageâto fall, as he had failed before, to
fyid the northwest passage. For six
months his ship was locked in the ice at
the southern .extremity of Hudson Bay,
which, larger 'than the Black and Caspian
together, might well be called a sea. A
viper Hudson had nourished in his bosom
proved the death of him. He deserved
better of Henry Green, who led the ma
tiny, for. wretch as Green was. he found
in the good-hearted captain a firm friend.
One midsummer day in 1S11 Green and his
mutinous companions set adrift In an
open boat upon the waste of Arctic
waters Henry Hudson, his son John and
seven sick men. who were never heard of
more. No one had striven so earnestly aa
Henry Hudson to find the northerly route
to India. Four ways he triedâ the way
across the pole, the Nova Zembla route,
the imaginary sea of Verrazano and tho
veritable sea of Hudson, Inadequately
called a bay. By none of them_dld he find
the route to India or to success. But ho

lie set the pace for smaller men. In
the years that followed his return from
the lonely "River of the Mountains" th<Â»
little round-pfowed vessels of the Dutch
in considerable numbers made their way
up the river to which he left his name.
Trade with the Indians began and flour
ished. Even the bays of the present New
Jersey and the coast as far south as ths
Delaware were visited by the Dutch fur
traders. Tho energetic fellows pushed out
right and left, and added fresh discov
eries to the scanty information of tha
time.
A typical and foremost spirit In this
work was Adrian Block. As early as 1511
he visited Manhattan and carried back

from end to end. He saw the Housatonlc

discoverer of the Hudson Rlyer. Nor f or r
that matter was he the first to find the
strait, the bay or the vast tract of land ,
in the far north that bear his name As :
X>r. Asher proves, the strait and ba>. as I
well as river, were marked on maps be
t fore the time of Hudson. Probably the j
memorv of the man would Ion? since have Â¦
perished but for the linking of his name |
with very Important physiographical fea- ,
tures Of our Western Hemisphere. His |
special service to the exploration of the ,
Western World was to push a little far- (
ther up and inland, to leave a somewhat
more distinct though still Imperfect rec- j
ord of the region visited than any pre- j
vious voyagers and to bring the Dutch to ;
Manhattan Island. He corrected in some
measure the popular belief as to the lead- ,
rng geographical concern of the age. He
showed that the passage to the Indies j
was not the simple thing men had thought j
If that there was no strait through j
the continent of North America In a low
latitude, and that if there was one In a |
high latitude it could have but little prac
tical significance. Aside from their In
trinsic interest In the history of naviga
tion Hudson's voyages are memorable tor
two other things. Firstly, they revealed j
the existence of whales In vast numbers j
about Spltzbergen and stimulated Holland ,
to take the lead, which she held until a
century ago, in the revival and extension
of whale fishery. Secondly, while doub
ling the North Cape on his return to the
Atlantic waters Hudson May 21, 1W9.
made the first recorded observation of a
sun spot, anticipating Harlot and Galileo
by a year or two.
The personality of the man is* shadowy.
We know him to have been bold, energet
ic, able, consumed with zeal to serve the
cause he represented. We know, too that
fortune, with refined cruelty, retired him
early to the list of those whom she would
cheat of a distinct and overmastering sue- ,
ce*s in life. In the service of the Dutch
East India Company when he sailed up
the Hudson River, he was not a Dutch
man, as folklore has assumed, but an
Englishman through and through and un
mistakable. Born in London, no one
knows exactly when. Henry Hudson came
of a family of adventurers and explorers.
It was the Alderman. Henry Hudson, pos
sibly his grandfather, who organized with
Sebastian Cabot the Muscovy Company,
incorporated 1533. to trade with Russia
and to find a passage to the Indies A ,
nephew of the Alderman. Christopher
Hudson, served as agent of the company
some years later and left behind many ev
idences of his Interest In Arctic explora
tion and In the colonization of America,
The Alderman's eldest sonn. Thomas Hud
son was intimate with Gilbert. Raleigh.
Hakluyt and John Davis, whom he ad
vised concerning his rearch for a north
west passage, which resulted In the dis
covery of Davie Strait. Whatever his re
lationship to these champions of explor
ation we may at least be sure that Henry
Hudson grew up In an atmosphere con
genial to a growing interest in the ex
ploration and exploitation of the West
ern Hemisphere.
He first appears on the stage of history
May 1. 1S07. a citizen of London, starting
from Greenwich in the service of the Mus
covy Company for the Arctic Ocean. In
structed to sail across the pole and find a
passage to the cast he tried to penetrate
between Greenland and Spltzberiren. found
no opening In the solid wall of ice that
blocked his way and returned to
England ere the year had ended. Early
the next season he was off again, but near
Xova Zembla the ice once more turned
him back and the only news of public In
terest which he brought was an accurate
description .furnished by two of the crew
of a mermaid they had seen with the face
of a woman and the tall of a speckled
mackerel.
In spite of the failure or each voyage
Hudson was received with open arms at
London. He was the Nansen of the year.
Though he had done nothing in particular
he had been well up north and had come
back In safetyâ a proof that he was no
mean sailor. His fame spread to the Con
tinent. Henry IV thought him the man to
bring distinction to France, but the flat
tering invitation rwiched him just after
he had closed with the more tempting of
fer of the Dutch East India Company to
leave the service of its English rival and
made a third attempt at Arctic explora
tion under Its auspices. .
He set sail from Amsterdam April 1. 1609.

commercial classes are crowded to their
utmost capacity. More than 300 pupila
are resistered and more are applying
Both the Lowell and the Girls' High
schools have a very lar^e attendance.
They will Wave four or five junior classes
apiece.
The changes which have been wrought
In the Irving. M. Scott. Grant and other
schools are not to the liking of the pa
rents, and the latter are up in arms
against the board. The Longtcllow Pri
mary School has been abolished, and the
pupils who attended that school have been
sent to . the new Longfellow Grammar
School, which was the old Rincon Gram
mar School, and to the Whittier Primary
School. Miss Ida E. Shaw, principal of
the Grant Primary School, has lost three
classes by reason of her three grammar
grades being ordered to attend the near
est grammar schools. This move not only
reduced Miss Shaw's salary $10 monthly
but compels her to teach a class in addi
tion to her duties as principal. The same
is true of Mrs. K. K. Brogan of the Moul
der Primary and Mlss-L.. McElroy of the
Harrison -Primary School. Miss M. A.
Deane. principal of the Redding Primary
School, loses a class, but it does not af
fect her salary.
The pupils of the Irving M. Scott School
who are in the grammar grades are com
pelled to travel to the nearest grammar
school, nearly two miles from their place
of residence. The mothers are indignant
anil threaten an indignation meeting to
protest against their children being com
pelled to travel so great a distance to at
tend school. Â¦ â¢ â¢â¢ _j
A prominent member of the School De
partment discussing the present outlook
in local educational circles said:
'T have never seen such an upheaval In
the department and -so much dissatisfac
tion on thepart of the parents, pupils and
teachers. There is a great deal of unrest
because of the summary action of the
board in consolidating classes and remov
ing teachers. â¢ It is . reported that twenty
more teachers will suffer loss of employ
ment through the new plan of consolida
tion.
"The Board of Education has put the
number of pupils In a class at flfty-nve,
but at the urgent request of the princi
pals It has modified this order so that
where rooms have not space for fifty-live
desks po many pupils as can be accom
modated are to form the class. A3 there
are very few schoolhouses that have
rooms large enough to accommodate rlfty
five desks, the order will fall of its own
impracticability. It ought to, because it
is extremely difficult for a schoolteacher
to educate a class In which there are fifty
flve pupils."

ers Are Busy Straight

HENRY HUDSON.
FIVE painters were precipitated [
.from a scaffoldine to a concrete |
walk fifteen feet below while at '
Â¦work on the Franklin School build
ing. Eighth and Bryant streets, yester
day afternoon. One of the men received
injuries which may cause his death:
three others were badly bruised and the
fifth clung to a rope, saving himself from
a dangerous fall. The accident was due
to the slipping of one of the hooks which
â¢held the platform In place. Had the scaf
folding been at a higher point on the
building the men would undoubtedly have
been Instantly killed.
Harry Murphy. Samuel Snow. Charles
Brooks, Bert Holland and Joseph McCar
ty. painters in the employ of Gus Schnee,
have been at Â¦work on the school building
for eeveral days. They had almost fin
ished their contract and were gradually
approaching the basement on the west
side when the accident occurred. The
scaffolding on wb,ich they worked was (
made fast by hooks on the edge of the i
roof. When about fifteen, feet from the!
I ground the strain on the ropes caused one
of the hooks to slip from its place hurling
I the men to the pavement below.
Murphy was on the end of the board
which gave away first. He struck the
concrete with terrible force and was so
i badly Injured about the head and internal
| ly that the physicians tear that he will not
j recover. Snow, whose seat was next to
I Murphy's, was also severely bruised and
I his chin lacerated. Bert Holland escaped
i with a strained foot and leg: Charles
Brooks fell upon the other men and se
verely wrenched his hip. McCarty was on
the other end of the board and when the
hook slipped he clutched the rope which
remained fast and held it until he reached
the ground, thus breaking the force of his
fall.
Murphy and Snow were taken to the
I City Receiving Hospital; Holland was
j sent to his homo at 201 Second street, and
Brooks was helped to his residence at 104

Born sailors as they were, the Dutch
were sure to be no laggards in exploring
and exploiting the New World. At the
fag end of the sixteenth century William
Barendz made his three historic voyages,
discovered Spitsbergen and sailed nearer
to the pole than any previous explorer;
and Kirk Gerrits making southward
touched the fringe of the great Antarctic
continent, first among the sailors to that
far distant land.
A little later, In 1609. while John Smith
still lay prostrate of the hurt Inflicted on
him bj- the accidental explosion of a ba?
of gunpowder, and while the pilgrims
were settling In Leyden. there to tarry
for ten years or more, the little Half
Moon, under a Dutch flag but a British
captain, flitted along our coast, entered
the beautiful river that bears the cap
tain's name and ascended It to the site of
Albany. But Henry Hudson was not the
first to spy out the river which bears his
name. Many Europeans had already
found It. Long years before, Verrazano
entered New York harbor, and in 1325
Gomez coasting south took notice of the
river. When in 1614 a syndicate of Dutch
merchants applied to their Government
for a special license to trade up and down
the Hudson they stated that the French
had first found out the river and long
before the time of Henry Hudson had
traded there with the Mohawks. There
can be tittle doubt that French skippers
from time to time sailed the ,river of the
Steep Hills, even up to the site of Albany,
to get furs from the Indians, and about 151?
built a fort on a long, low island "Mar
the present southern limits of the city of
Albany."
Henry Hudson was therefore not the
John Smith, just closing his career at
Jamestown, telling him that In the pre^
vious summer he had explored t>e Chesa
peake Bay and was convinced the passage
to the Indies lay a little north. The letter
was of extreme value and, a3 Flske points
out. it attached the name of John Smith
to the beginnings! of American history
in the middle as well as in the southern
and northern zones. By May 1 the Half
Moon was bumping around among the Ice
bergs not far from Nova Zembla. and the
sailors, unused to such cold weather and
such hardships, were quarreling amor.g
themselves and growing, like the sailors
of Columbus, insubordinate. Hudson un
der pressure turned toward America,
skirted the coast from Nova Scotia to thÂ»
Chesapeake, mistook probably Machipoa
go Inlet for the Jame3 River, passed It
â¢with the remark. "This is the entrance
into the King's River in Virginia, whera
our Englishmen are." turned northward,
entered Delaware Bay, followed the New
Jersey coast to Sandy Hook, and Septem
ber 3 dropped archor off Staten Island liko
Verraiano eighty-five- years before.
The natives thereabouts crowded around
the boats of the foremost sailor of the
year. The mate's journal tells us "the
people of the country came aboard of U3.
seeming very jrlad of our coming." Grow
ing familiar as the Half Moon made Its
way up the river, which Hudson thought
a strait connecting with the Indian Ocean,
some nf the Indians paid the penalty of
their lives for their temerity, but they
gave a good account of themselves in bat
tle. AftÂ°r a week or more, as the nar
rowing of the river and freshening of the
water proved that Hudson was not in the
strait he longed to find, he cast anchor
just above the present site of Albany, set
the bad example followed by most of his
successors in dealing with the Indiana of
introducing them to the "much wine and
aqua vitae" of the white man, and then
THE CALL'S
HOME STUDY CIRCLE
The Board of Supervisors adopted a res
olution at yesterday's meeting which will
have the effect of tempora rily prohibiting
the Market Street Railway Company
from changing the First street road into
an electric railway. The company recent
ly deposited poles' along the street named,
but Acting Mayor Tobln directed the
Chief of Police to prevent their erection
until permission had been obtained from
the Beard cf Supervisors. Mayor Tobin
said yesterday that he was against the
erection of overhead wires, and that he
would certainly oppose any high-handed
proceeding on the part of the corporation
In constructing an electric line on First
street, or any other street, where permis
sion had not first been' obtained.
The resolution on the subject was intro
duced by Curtis, and gives notice to the
Market Street Railway Company that it
will be required to postpone operations
contemplated In changing the road on
First street into an electric line. The
company had filed notice that it would be
gin such work August A. but the Super
visors decided to investigate before allow
ing the work to be commenced. It will be
ascertained whether the company pos
sesses any legal right to begin opera
tion?. The resolution was adopted imme
diately and the Board of Public Works
was notified to see that the work be not
begun without authority.
Will Take Up Unused Rails.
The Market Street Railway Company
petitioned that it be granted permission
to abandon an-3 remove certain street car
tracks and appliances, agreeing to restore
the streets now occupied by the same to
good condition. The tracks are situated
as follows:
On Montgomery avenue, from Filbert to
Greenwich street, a double track ami switches;
at the Junction of Montgomery avenue, Wash
ington and Montgomery streets; a single track.
ccMimencinc Rt the crossing of Powell street
an-1 Montgomery avenue and lying alonir Mont
gomery avÂ»nue to Mason street; on Bay street,
frcm Powell to Taylor; on Berry street, from
Fourth to Fifth: on Jackson street, from Mont
gomery avenue to Kearny street, a single track:
electric tracks ami roles on Carl street, from
Stanyan to I; thence along I street to Ninth
avenue anJ a Ions Ninth avenue to H street.
The petition was referred to the Com
mittee on Streets.
House-Movers Protest.
A petition from Henry Chester and Pat
rick Gleason that they be given a hearing
in their protest against the -proposed law
Imposing a license of %zA) per quarter on
house-movers and house-raisers was re
ferred to the License Committee. The pe
tition says:
This license Is unjust and in furtherance of
the plans of certain trusts or combinations of
house-movers, who are now designing to destroy
competition in their business and render it un
profitable for any person other than them
selves to enlace therein. About eleven firms
engaged in ths business of hous<vmovlng have
entered Into such a combination; that â¢ five
rther firms have associated themselves Into a
co-partnership called the San Francisco House
movers' Company No. 1. In which name they
have taken out a single license.
The ordinance allowing the San Fran
cisco special messenger service to main
tain overhead wires In certain sections of
the city was opposed by Reed, Â¦who said
that there was a law compelling all wires
to be placed underground. A long discus
sion was brought to an end by referring
the ordinance to the City Attorney for
his opinion as to the power of the board
to grant the privilege.
Violation of Charter.
The ordinance eliminating: certain ap
propriations from the provisions of the
one-twelfth act contained in the charter
was finally passed. Brandensteln op
posed the passape on the ground that It
was In direct violation of the charter.
Reed explained that unless certain funds
were exempted by ordinance that some of
the departments of the city government
would come to a standstill.
Miscellaneous Business.
It was resolved that In all Instances
where gas lamps were located beneath
electric arc lights and both were used for
Illuminating purposes the gaslights should
be discontinued and the electric arc lights
be permitted to remain: also that where
gas lamps at present serve to mark the
position of fire alarm boxes the globes of
the electric arc lamps remaining
crowned with a red rim for the purpose of
designating the location of these boxes.
The ordinance Imposing a license of $3 per
year on bootblack stands located on streets or
sidewalks, and r^uiring permits to conduct
them from the Board of Public Works, was
postponed for one week: the ordinance Imposing
a lleense on hotel solicitors was amended to
make the license $15 per quarter and the price
cf runners' badges 11 60 each; the Independent
Electric Light and Power Company was grant
ed sermifsion to use oil as fuel In the hollers
of Its generating plant at Twenty-third and
Louisiana streets. The Finance Committee was
directed to deposit the Wlndel bequest of J1S.
210 CO In the Hibernla, German and Mutual
Saving* hanks and In the San Francisco Sav
ings Union and with the Savings and Loon So
ciety. The balance of K441 02 In the HÂ»rnal
Paik Improvement fund of the last fiscal year
was transferred to the general fund of this
year, to be applied to the farther improvement
of Bernal Park. The City Attorney was re
quested for his opinion whether an appropria
tion can legally be made for the Seml-Centen
nial Admission day celebration. Superintend
ent of Public Building? was directed to make
an inventory of all property belonging to the
city In the public building*. The Commercial
Publishing Company was authorized to assign.
It* contract for printing municipal reports for
IS??-1SCO to William M. Hinton Jr.. provided he
flies a sufficient bond with the board. The_
Board of Health was authorized by ordinance.
Introduced by Supervisor Curtis, to abate a
nuisance occa?Ioned by dumping of sewage In
the district bounded by San Bruno avenue. Bry
ant. Twenty-sixth and Army streets. The or
dinance providing for the construction of a
plank roadway on Spear street, between Harri
son and Bryant, at a cost of 15100. was laid
over for one week, when Commissioner Ma
puire of the Board of Works will submit a new
proposition on the subject. The application of
Charles HI fickle for permission to hunt Jack
rabbits with a shotgun was referred to the
Committee on Public Utilities. The ordinance
Imposing a license on stationary wagons or
stands from which merchandise Is gold was
Indefinitely postponed. The Committee on Pub
lic Utilities will meet this evening at 8 o'clock
to take up the question of a municipal water
supply system, and also to consider plans for
a city electrical distributing plant.

shipments for the week were 6,000,000 bushels.
Liverpool and Paris futures were lower.
Corn was higher under small receipts and a
pood demand and reported light stocks every
where.

merely depressed Italian bonds

hardened African mine* fractionally. Consols
were heavy on the expectation of a statement
In Parliament to-night showing how the Gov

I CHICAGO, July Z%â Wheat was quite weak
i at tiie <.i|>*>ni:-.g and ftr tome time after. Llver
1 pool cables thowed a decided sluirip In prices
' in that market, while reports from the North
! west told of more favorable weather. Though
sfiiing premira was not particularly heavy, it
was fcufflclcnt to drive a point % below Satur
day's iigures in the four and a half hours'
trading. But here the decline stopped. Shorts
came into the market to cover at the low
I prices, and though at times the market devel
j oped soft spots, yet on the whole steadiness was
; fchoWu until the last hour's trading. Then the
! r.-..-irkct became strong. Some buying crderÂ«
! came in during the morning from the seabord.
I They were accoini anled by reports of an ini
i pruventent in the export demand and these re
! ports later became the predominating influence
i on trading. Hepurts as to the total engage-
I ments were conflicting, the figures running
from 21 to 60 loads, the report creating a mild
sensation among traders and causing the mar
ket to close at best figures for the day. Trad
j ing was quite active late In the session, shorts
! covering- liberally, and early sellers attempting
to buy back their lines. September opened %<Q
Â» 8 c lower at 74*i,^74^c. It declined to H%c and
i sold for Â«-<>me time between that figure and
| 74 1 1 c. then rallied to 75U@"5Vic, where it closed.
; Corn's opening prices were somewhat lower,
\ but the market soon rallied sharply. September
; closed Uo higher at 3S->gC. '
', < -ats were heavy all day. September closed
: Sc lower at 21"ic.
; Provisions were dull and heavy most of the
; morning, but before the close all of the declines
had been recovered. The weakness of wheat
1 and lower hog prices caused some liquidation
' early, but covering took place later when the
1 grain markets developed more strength.
; A feature of the trading was the strength of
> September ribs, which sold T'.jc over-jresterday.
, The cash demand was good and this and small
, local stocks were factors. September pork and
I lard closed unchanged with ril>5 5c higher.

S.2Long Communication Is Referred to
the Official Who Made the
Original Charges.
A long communication from the Board
of Health was read at yesterday's meet
ing of the Board of Supervisors, In which
the former body enters a denial of the
statements made by Supervisor McCarthy
regarding Us course during the recent
plague scare. The communication deals
with two specific charges made by Mc-
Carthy. The first, that the Board of
Health had expended the city's money In
cleaning private premises, is denied. The
second charge, that the Board had been
guilty of double dealing in forcing the
merchants to donate the funds to estab
lish the quarantine without informing
them that the State Board of Health had
been rendered powerless by the refusal 01
Governor Gage to allow It the use of State
funds In quarantining the city, is also de
nied by the board. It is alleged that such
action on the part of the Governor was
not known to the members of the board.
After the communication had been read
Reed moved that the communication be
referred to McCarthy himself. After a
motion to postpone indefinitely had been
lost the motion to refer to McCarthy pre
vailed. ,

Football Manager Gildersleeve Re
turns From the East With New
Ideas Concerning Training.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, July 30.â
Interest In Stanford athletics for the
coming year was revived to-day by the
return of Football Manager J. Burt Gil
dersleeve from an extended tour of the
East. The object of his trip was to ar
range for a game with the Princeton
eleven for the coming season and inciden
tally to Investigate the training facilities
of the Eastern colleges. The prospects of
securing a game with Princeton, to be
played soon after the close of the local
season, are exceedingly bright, as Prince
ton was only prevented from making the
trip last year bv financial difficulties,
which Manager Gildersleeve says will In
no way interfere with a game this year.
He anticipates no trouble in securing the
consent of the Princeton faculty and is
confident that the men will be eager to
come.
That Stanford Is held in high esteem
throughout the East was proved by the
fine treatment which was accorded Man
ager Gildersleeve while on his trip. He
was particularly well pleased with the
cordial manner with which his proposal
to send a Stanford track team East In
1902 was received. Such a trip could un
doubtedly be made a financial success.
Manager Gildersleeve speaks very highly
of Coach Yo3t. whom he met at Pittsburgh
and savs that he possesses the qualities
of a gentleman, besides being a man of
extraordinary physical strength and a
good general on the football field. Yost
will arrive at Stanford late in August. In
order to be on hand at the opening of the
season. To many the most gratifying
news of the trip will be that "Doc" Mur
phy has been secured to train the Stan
ford athletes next year. His selection Is
due. to his admirable work last year and
the fact that he is now perfectly familiar
with all the old men. .
Manager Gildersleeve returns with a
great deal of Information concerning
Eastern training quarters, which will be
of value in the final work of drawing up
the plans for the Quarters here. He con
siders Houston Hall, at the University of
Pennsylvania, the superior of any Eastern
training house, and would like to see some
of Its arrangements followed in the pro
posed plans for Stanford. It Is early to
make any estimates of Stanford's football
prospects for next year. The usual num
ber of- "stars" are under cover, and It !s
to be hoped that some of them may be
pecured. Captain "Babe" Burnett ha?
been spending the summer In the Yosem
lte and Is sure to return In excellent con
ditfon. De Forest, the veteran puard. was
seen on the campus recently, and ex
gressed himself as being confident of
tanford's success this fall.

It Was Taken TJp for Agricultural
Purposes and Mineral Iteposits

Judjra Beatty In the I'nited States Cir
cuit Court yesterday ordered a decree in
favor of the defendant in the suit of the
United States against Job Pettit. an
action to vacate an agricultural land pat
ent issued to J. Claiborne for a tract near
the town of Plymouth in Amador County.
The complaint averred thai the patent
was obtained through the false represen
tation that the land was more valuable
for agricultural purposes than for min
erals, and In proof of this averment the
fact was cited that the mother lode of
the Amador County mines runs through
the land. Ex-Judge Curtis H. Lindley
appeared for Fettit and proved to the
satisfaction of the court that at the time
the patent was applied for and after it
â¢was obtained the land was used for agri
cultural purposes, and he argued that the
fact that mineral was afterward discov
ered on the land did not necessarily Bhow
that fraudulent representation had been
made.

fricassee and dog steak. That Is the bill
of fare which Frank Brackett and Irvie
Meads have been recently discussing on
their way into the Koyukuk country from
Fort Yukon. Besides the viands men

the swamps, while the mosqultos kept
them from getting the scurvy for lack or

Brackett and Meads left Skajruay rthis

and took the trail across the seventy-five,
mile swamp to Kovukuk. The men wer<Â»
lost in the swamp, and after some tlma
the horses succumbed to hardships and
died. They left the horses and endeav

into the wilderness.
Whon their food gave out they killed
and ate their dogÂ», and then came a pe

an owl was shot and this fed them until
they were found by a miner named Stew

HOOT OWL FRICASSEE

Will Box Twenty-Five Hounds Be
fore the Twentieth Century-
Club in August,
NEW YORK. July 2O.-James J. Corbett
and Charles (Kid) McCoy have been
matched to fight twenty-five rounds be
fore the Twentieth Century Club in Madi
sor.-square Garden in the last week" qt
August. This announcement was made
from the garden arena to-night just be
fore the McFadden-O'Brten bout, and it
occasioned an unusual amount of interest.
Corbett and McCoy have been talking
at each other for a long time. A match
between them was announced several
wef-ks ago, but Corbett promptly denied
it. Then there was quiet and finally they
met a few nights ago in Corbeit's saloon,
where a wordy combat enlivened matters
for a time, ending in the ejectment of the
Kid. McCoy, suffering from the affront,
and not being, as he himself put it, "a
bar room brawler," let himself out with
*ho following telegram, which reached
Corfcett in the course of time:
"I have posted $2500 with Al. Smith to
fight you at your own terms before Sep
tember 1. If you are not a coward
cover it. KID McCOY."
The former heavyweight champion was
enraged, and declared that although he
had barred all men but Jeffries he would
fight McCoy before the Twentieth Century
Ciub, provided there was money enough in
the proposition the club might submit.
Evidently the club has met Corbett'a
wishes in a. satisfactory way. because of
the announcement which the manager
was able to make to-night. Corbett asked
for sixty per cent of the gate receipts.
CORBETT AND MX0Y
HAVE BEEN MATCHED
seeks to enjoin the Fire Commission from
awarding contracts for shoeing depart
ment horses to John O'Rourke. Crowley
was called as an expert to testify a* to
the number of bar shoes required, in his
opinion, by the department. He said that
even when he was shoeing the horses he
did not use as many bar shoes as was
necessary towird the last, "as his con
tract wa"Â«Â« to expire in June."
"Is it a fact that you did not use the re
quired number cf bar shoes for the sole
reason that your contract was about to
expire?" asked Judee Hebbard.
"That's about the size of it," answered
Crowley. and cnmimiing he said that
when horses were brought in for shoeing
he put the plain shoes on if they had been
wearing that kind, even though the con
dition of their feet warranted bar shoes.
This testimony was intended to aid
O'Rourke's side of the controversy, but
what effect it will have remains to be
seen.
Fire Commissioner J. C. McKinstry was
also a witness, and although admitting
that he was not politically friendly with
Kennedy, the plaintiff, he asserted that
he gave his vote to award the contract
to O'Rourke because he was the lowest
bidder. The case goes on again to-day.

TWO EXCELLENT STAKES
FOR SAN MATEO PARK
"MIKE" COKLUJ-S, EOXING INSTRUCTOR OF ARGENTINE
KA"\ A"L CARETS.
mIKB COLLINS, the popular
Olympic Club athlete, who left
this city thirteen months ago on
the Argentine training ship Presi
dents Sarmiento as athletic instructor,
has returned to this city, after completing
a circle of the globe.
Collins has an interesting tale to tell
about his work with the young naval stu
dents of the South American republic.
None of them had ever felt the impact of
a boxing glove until he took them in hand.
They were likewise uneducated in all the
gymnastic exercises that make a part of
the daily life of the average young Ameri
can. "But in the twelve months trip
around the world this score of Argentine
cadets learned much, and now they can
duck, crosscounter. swing and guard as
though to th.-> manner born.
The physical training which Collins pre
scribed for the South American embryonic
naval warriors consisted of boxing, deck
racing, basket-ball and bag-punching.
For two hours every day he instructed
the tvros in the various branches of the
work. In midocean or in harbor, his daily
routine work was conducted with steady
earnestness. The result of it all is that
Collins is wanted very much by the Ar
gentine Government, and he will return
there in a few months.
Collins' trip was ideal and the pleasure
of it was augmented by the splendid and
courteous treatment he received at the
hands of his pupils. He was one of them
in all their rambles and jaunts in foreign
cities, at all times enjoying the hospitality
tendered the captain and officers.
Leaving 1 San Francisco, the Presidents
Sarmiento steamed to Honolylu, Japan,
China, India, Ceylon, Arabia, Egypt,
Greece, Italy, Austria, France, Algiers,
Spain. Madeira Inlands. Venezuela. Cuba
and New York. Five to lifteen days were
spent in all the large cities at which the
snip stopped and very few cities of any
consequence to the general tourist were
omitted.
Wh"n Collins left the Presidente Sar
miento in New York he was specially en
tertained and was made to promise that
he would visit the South America republic
within a few months.

Arrangements for the parade have r.nw
reached such a point that even Grand
Marshal Costello is somewhat surprised at
the comprehensiveness of the promis^l
display. Interior counties are evincing an
interest by no mean* confined to the Na
tive Sons. It seems the wish of every one
of them to present a display which will
effectively exploit its industries and re
sources. Parlor floats are being planned
upon these lines. The procession cf floats
promises to be one of the parades most

Fire Department. The evening attractions
will be a grand electrical parsuie. during

Notice reached the grand marshal yes
terday that a float will be among the feat
ures of display presented by the three par
lors of San Jose. This notice was accom
panied by a pertinent inquiry as to the
distance above the street of trolley wires
crossing the line of march. Inquiry at
railroad headquarters elicited the fact
that the lowest wires alor.g me route of
march are twenty feet above the street.
All organizations proposing to have fioatd
are requested to bear this fact in mind.
The grand marshal and a member of the
parade committee visited the San Fran
cisco Cabinet of the National Union to in
duce that fraternal organization to j co
operate with the Native Sons in the mat
ter of the parade. It is probable that the
order will be represented by a symbolical
float.

assurance that the Wyoming will be

Before the fight came off there was a
twelve-round go at 105 pounds between
Charley Garrigan and Terry Edwards,
both of Brooklyn. The work of these two
bantams was amateurish and the contest
resulted in a draw.
McFadden was seconded by Billy Roche,
Harry Tuttle, Archie Martin and Tommy
Shortell. O'Brien's handlers were Torn
O'Rourke, Paddy Mo ran and Sammy
Kelly.
The betting on the bout was not very
brisk. McFadden was the favorite at IJu
to 60 early in the evening, but later tnesÂ«
odds were increased. 2 to 1 being freely
laid on McFadden and even money that
he would win within fifteen round3. Both
men weighed in thi3 afternoon, each be
ing under the limit of 133 pounds.
There were about 5000 persons In the
house, most of whom had seen the Erne-
McGovern contest two weeks ago and it
was the general impression that McGov
ern could beat either of the lightweights
in to-night's bout.
In the early stages of the tight O'Brien
did fairly well and with his rushing tac
tics kept McFadden blocking on the de
fensive," but as the battle went on ifc-
Fadden's superior strength began to tell
and it was plain to be seen that O'Brien
was in difficulty. In the tenth round
O'Brien's legs began to give out and it
was only a question of how long his pluck
and endurance would carry him.
In the twelfth round O'Brien was sent
to the floor three times with lefts and
rights over the heart and was in such
bad condition that when he went to hts
corner at the end of the round he wai
advised to give up. He complained of
his left side, but he insisted on, going on.
However, better counsel prevailed and he
was Induced to shake hands with Mc-
Fadden, who would certainly have put
him out in another round. When O'Brien
was examined by a physician after he
reached his dressing-room it was dis
covered that the seventh and eighth ribs
on his left side were broken.
MADISON SQUARE GARDEN, XEW
YORK. July 20,-George McFadden, the
local lightweight boxer, administered a
severe drubbing to Jack O'Brien, formerly
of Halifax, N. S., but now a resident of
this city, before the Twentieth Century
Club at J^ulison Square Garden to-night.
The pair met for a twenty-five-round bout
at the lightweight limit, 133 pounds, Cut
there were only twelve rounds of. fighting.
O'Brien was so badly punished in the
twelfth round that he was forced to give
up when the bell rang for the beginning
of the thirteenth and instead of putting
up his hands for attack or defense he ex
tended his gloved right hand to McFad
den, giving the latter the bout.

The f entiraent expressed at the meeting
was favorable to holding primary elec.

that the work of county committees in
preparing to hold such elections under the
Straiten law must be undone. In several

Mysterious Deaths of Dtincan McClel

, at Waco.
WACO, Texas, July 30. â A mysterious
double tragedy occurred at an early hour
to-day at the residence of M. - C. . Kings
bury, one of Waco's most prominent citi
zens. The dead bodies of Dtmcan G. Mc-
Clellan Jr. and Myron C. Klnjrsbury,
brothers-in-law, were found In a room,
their throats being cut from ear to ear.
The fact that neither body was Injured
or bruised except about the throat indi
cate that no struggle took place, and It is [
the general opinion that the two men were j
murdered.
Mrs. Klngsbury, wife of one of the dead
men. made the following statement:
"About 2 o'clock, I think it was, I was
suddenly awakened by some kind of noise
emanating from my husband's room,
across the hall. I sprang 1 up and ran into
the Â¦ room. , Before me lay my husband,
who had just drawn his last breath, and
Duncan, my brother, only drew one or
two brefcths after I entered the room. I
saw no one run â¢ from the room and can
not solve the mystery."
The police are at work on the case.

in the Famine Districts of
India.
LONDON, July 30.â The following dis
patch from the Viceroy of India, Lord
Curzon of Keddlestone, to the Secretary
of State for India, Lord George Hamil
ton, was received to-day:
"Considerable anxiety Is felt owing to
the weakness of the monsoon. The situa
tion is serious and critical in Guadajarat,
Baroda and Rajputana West, which are
not sown. No fodder whatever Is available
ln the southwest part of the Punjab. Sown
crops are in imminent danger, as rain
continues to hold -off. Fodder Is scarce
and cattle are dying in the central pro
vinces of the Therera and Hyderabad.
Good crops are possible only in case the
monsoon improves.
"One-quarter of the inhabitants of the
central provinces are on Mief. The total
number "requesting relief is 6,266,000," with
incomplete Bombay figures."
The Governor of Bombay telegraphs
that there were S607 cholera cases in the
famine district during the week ending
July 21. of which 5073 resulted fatally. The
total deaths In the relief works of the
British district were 6753, or 425 per 1000.
There has been a good rainfall In North
Gujarat and Kathiawar, and agricultural
prospects are favorable in the remalndei
of the affected tracts.
The numbers on relief works are de
creasing and gratuitous relief is increas
ing.

Accident to One of the' Cylinders Pre

Builders Are Satisfied.
PHILADELPHIA, July SO.â The Russian
cruiser Varlag returned to Cramp's ship
yards to-day from her trial trips. During
the run back .from Boston the ship, was
speeded with the view of fulfilling the
contract requirement of twenty-three
knots an hour for twelve hours. The trial
began off Nantucket Shoals, and a con
tinuous speed of 23.S to 23.7 knots was de
veloped for seven and a half hours, when
an accident to one of the high-pressure
cylinders compelled the abandonment of
the remaining four and a half hours*
trial. In a statement given out at the of
fice of the builders It is said that the
speed already developed showed. there
could be no reasonable doubt M the abil
ity to maintain a speed cor. â¢ erably in
excess of twenty-three knots. :â¢_ Â£,Â¦-,?

GEORGETOWN, Ky., July 30.âEx-Sec
retary of State Caleb Powers took the
stand in his own behalf to-day, but did
not complete his testimony on direct ex
amination. He will be on the stand all
day to-morrow. His defense is an admis
sion that he organized the body of moun
taineers who went to Frankfort on sev
eral occasions last winter for influence
with the State Contest Board and the
Legislature, but not to intimidate them.
He entered a denial of the damaging
charges made against him by Witnesses
Culton, Golden, Noakes and others. On
the stand this afternoon he denied that
Henry Youtzey had the keys to his office
on tiie day of theassasslnatlon, but said
that there were two keys to the office,
one of which was- in the possession of for
mer Assistant Secretary of State W. J.
Davidson and another in the possession of
Ben Rowe, Governor Taylor's colored por
ter. Powers says neither of these keys
was ever in his possession, and that he
had his own key In his pocket in Louis
ville the day of the assassination. David
son is in the far West, supposed to be In
the State of Washington, and Rowe, the
colored porter, is somewhere in Indiana,
probably at Anderson.
Commonwealth's Attorney Franklin said
to-night if it is shown that Robert
weaver, the witness who claimed to be
from Colorado and who gave sensational
testimony, swore falsely he will be prose
cuted for forgery. "Weaver Is being held
here, and the commonwealth's attorney
has instructed the police to shadow him
and prevent him from leaving pending an
investigation.
In regard to the bringing of the moun
taineers to Frankfort, the witness said:
'There were three crowds of men
brought to Frankfort, and I had some
thing to do with the organization. The
purpose was to show the interest of these
people in the matters in hand at that
time, and not to intimidate either the
Election Board or the Legislature. I in
structed the men to do no acts of violence,
and, so far as I know, none was com
miued by them.
"The last crowd of men was brought
for a double purpose. "We expected to use
them as witnesses before the contest
board, -and also to show by their pres
ence the Interest they felt in the contests.
\\ e also had heard rumors that we were
to be forcibly ejected from the offices.
These rumors were based on newspaper
reports. We intended to resist violence."
Continuing, the witness said he had re
ceived information that Mr. Hill, the con
testant for Secretary of State, would not
wait until the contests were settled in
court, but would undertake to take forci
ble possession as soon as the contest
board acted.
Secrecy Necessary.
"If that sort of thing." said he, "had
been attempted, we intended to hold the
offices. I had a conference with Governor
Taylor, and he advised the bringing of a
large body of men to show their interest
in political affairs. He also advised that
they be brought armed, and promised to
pay the expenses. I acted on this. The
plans were kept secret to prevent drop
ping us through a bridge or derailing our
train. I told those In the conference that
the utmost secrecy must be observed in
getting there before the news got out."
At the afternoon session the defendant
resumed the stand. He told of the Bar
bourville conference, at/ which Finley.
Powers and others discussed the arrange
ments for taking the mountaineers to
Frankfort with John A. Black, who
stremgly opposed the movement. The wit
ness said ho assured Black that he and
Finley would use their best endeavors to
keep the crowd from degenerating into a
mob," but denied that he told Black he
was Eroing to organize a mob.
He said he had no recollection of having
said in the presence of W. H. Culton
that the Legislature would be given thirty
minutes to act, and if it did not do it in
that time they would kill the Democratic
legislators. Afterward he said positively
that no such remarks were made, and
added:
"The men came and nothing of the sort
was done. "We could have cleaned them
up, as Culton put It, if we had desired."
In regard to sending the men home from
Frankfort the evening of January 25.
about which Witness Noakes testified last
week, and told of a breach between the
witness and Governor Taylor, Powers
said:
"I heard that they were going to send
the men home, and I opposed, as the men
had been up all the night before. I went
to see Governor Taylor. He told me it
had been decided to send them home, as
their presence was having a bad effect."
Kept His Keys.
The witness testified that he did not
glvo Toutsey a key, or keys, nor did he
hear a conversation with John Powers
and Golden In reference to Goebel going
to be killed by Tallow. Dick Combs. He
did meet him in the hall of the Legisla
tive building, and Youtsey asked him to
let him into the offl/e. Witness did not
know why Youtsey wanted to get in there,
but witness did not want him In there.
"Witness had his keys in his pocket.
He talked with Treasurer Day and with
"vV. J. Davidson Monday evening, January
29, about bringing another body of men
to Frankfort, but he did not decide till
Tuesday morning, the morning of the as
sassination. It was agreed to do it. **
Day. Golden and witness went to Louis
ville for the purpose of securing transpor
tation for the crowd that was to be got
up. The witness explained that the slip
of paper found in his pockets when he
was arrested and which read, "Powers is
our friend," signed by W. S. Taylor, was
given to him by Governor Taylor on the
morning of the assassination to be taken
to Pension Agent Leslie Combs at Louis,
vllle, who had charge of the funds with
which the expenses of the contest were
being paid.
The testimony was Interrupted at this
point by adjournment

Charles H. McClure. alias Charles How

prison awaiting the pleasure of Captain
Sfvmour and his detectives who are
Catherine evidence with which they hope
to prove him guilty of three recent up
country safe cracking exploits.
SlcClure about two weeks ago. went to
Captain Seymour and related a hard luck
etory of woman's perfidy and deceit and
wound up his sad tale by asking for a
warrant for the arrest of Mollie Land, a
young and pretty chambermaid of Tu
olumne County, who. he claimed, had
jilted him after bunkoing him out of sev
eral hundmd dollars. H'e said the fair
Mollie came to this city with him to be
married, but that after he had lavished
presents and money or. her she had dis
appeared, leaving a note explaining that
ehe did not love him well enough to marry
him. McClure was certain she had eloped
â¢with a snake eater until he learned that
the devourer of reptiles was still in town.
The warrant was issued and placed in
the hands of the Sheriff of the county in
which the young woman made her home,
but that oflioial has not yet located her.
While telling Mollie what a pood hus
band he would make for her. McClure led
her to bf-lleve that he had just disposed
of an interval in one of his mines and to
strengthen his story exhibited consider
able money. About this time theÂ»XV~ells-
Fargo safe at Sndllns, Merced County,
â¢was broken into and $400 in silver taken
from it.
The company's det^otivps were put to
Â¦work on the case and while looking for
the culprit, a similar crinn' was reported
from AptoF. Santa Cruz County. On July

place was roblx^d of J2>KÂ» in money, 527U in

Camille d'Arville Here to "Wed.

stress and vaudeville favorite, arrived in
this city yesterday evening from Deer
Lick. Ind.. and is stopping at the Occi
dental. Miss d'Arville Is under engage
ment to the Orpheum management to ap

yet to be fixed."
It was a bad hour and a half that Hor
ace Philbrook put in yesterday morning
trying to convict E. S. Pillsbury of hid
ing away from a process server. Pills
bury's deposition in the gardianship mat
ter of James P. Merritt was being taken
by Notary Mosebach. and Philbrook was
doing the cross-examining: On a previous
occasion, about a week ago, Pillsbury
was before the notary, but he left sud
denly to keep an appointment he had, and
Philbrook saw in this action a desire to
escape giving evidence. He said so In his
questions, and Pillsbury explained mat
ters, but It left him in no enviable frame
of mind for what was coming.
Philbrook took up the question of the
service on, Pillsbury to appear before the
notary, and asked the lawyer if he had
not heard that a. deputy sheriff had called
just before the first hearing before the
notary with a subpena for him to appear.
Pillsbury said he had heard that a man
named Philbrook had called to see him,
saying he had with*him a deputy sheriff,
but Pillsbury said he thought the state
ment was untrue and' nothing more than
a ruse to gain entrance, and so he paid no
attention to it.
Then Philbrook asked If Pillsbury had
not tried to evade summons, and Pills
bury denied that he had done so. He said
in answer to Philbrook's questions that
one day some one, finding the door In the
hallway tb his offices open, stepped in and
knocked loudly and boisterously at the
door to' his private office. He rang the
bell for his office boy and sent him out to
find who was knocking, and the boy came
back with word that it was Philbrook
and another man.
"My first impulse was to go out and
kick the man down stairs." said Pillsbury
to Philbrook, "and I'm sorry now that I
did not: but I told my office boy to call
the janitor and have him put the man
out. I did not try to evade summons and
when I heard that there might-have been
?w de g u . ty .Â« heri 7 cal I in S. on me I rang up
the Sheriff and told him if he had any
process to serve on me to bring it down
and I would accept service "."
Philbrook then tried to bring out by his
questions that Pillsbury had gone out by
the private door to his offices and had
eon t t< L- the , strcet bv the stairway, and
not by the elevator, but Pillsbury content
ed himself with the statement that he had
not tried to evade summons, and an-

Get your
piano
tuned
Now that you have returned
from the country it is a good time
to hue the piano thoroughly re- |
paired, tuned and cleaned. Moths !
and dust are very injurious to a
piano â they accumulate, particu-
larly when a piano is unused.
We have expert piano tuners
who can put your piano in first- j

We respectfully ask customers j
to leave order? for tuning at least
two or three days in advance of
when they wish the work done â
we are quite busy at present.
