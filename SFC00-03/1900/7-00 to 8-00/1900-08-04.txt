the gravity of the situation. It is endeavoring to throw the responsibility for the outrages in Pe
king and elsewhere on mobs. Through diplomacy it is seeking to foment- international jealousies
to prevent the advance of the troops on Peking, to escape lawful punishment and to patch up
a peace. Foreigners here feel that the Chinese Government is responsible for the chaos, and they
are indignant at the reception given to Li Hung Chang at Shanghai. It is the conviction of every
one that no half-way measures should be used. There is nothing to prevent a march on Peking
and the overthrow of the present Government. It is commonly asserted that if this is not done the
same trouble will be repeated even.' few years.

SUMMARY OF THE CHINESE SITUATION.
rpHERE is nothing to prevent an advance upon Peking and the overthrow of the imperial G ov- #
Â¦ erntnent, cables a correspondent at Chefu. Many indications are to hand that this is pre
cisely what the Chinese Government most dreads and what it is seeking to avoid.
Announcements that all foreigners in Peking will be massacred If allies advance; that Li
Fing Hong, the former Viceroy of Shantung, with an unenviable record, has joined hands with
Prince Tuan; that two pro-foreign members of the Tsung li Yamen have been beheaded and
that anarchy reigns in the capital, together with Li Hung Chang's endeavor to open up negotia
tions through Consul Goodnow, read suspiciously like efforts to gain time and evade respon-
While there is still a lack of definite news regarding an advance all the dispatches to hand
indicate that an immediate move was expected several days ago. An interesting light is thrown
orv what is expected to be the character of the campaign by measures taken at Washington to
provide winter equipment for the American forces.
In the latest dispatch received from Minister Conger, dated June 25, he says that they
can hold out for six days.
It is reported that many missionaries of various nationalities in Shansi province have
been massacred and fear is felt for Americans there, from whom no word has been received
for two months.
A special cable dispatch to The Call from Hongkong says that all the missionaries from
Hainan have reachedthat port with the exception of four, who are af Hoihow, where a French
cruiser is ready to bombard the town if the foreigners are imperiled. It is estimated in London
that from ten to fifteen thousand defenseless Christians have been massacred outside of Pe
king by imperial troops.

THREATS THAT MINISTERS IA/ILL BE SLAIN.
CALL BUREAU, WELLINGTON HOTEL, -WASH- ,
INGTON, Aug. 3.â China has ' responded .to the ;
allies' aidvance on Peking by virtually" announcing, that
she will hold the Ministers as hostages. , This is the interpreta
tion which the administration officials put upon the dispatch re
ceived to-day from Consul General Goodnow at (Shanghai.
Goodnow's message does not entirely agree with the dispatch re
ceived from the Governor of Shantung, transmitted by Consul
Fowler at Chefu. The contradictions between the two mes
sages is explained here, on the assumption that Yuan's advices
left Peking before the news of the advance had reached there. At
all events there is a disposition to attach more 'importance tp.Li
Some of the authorities still think the Imperial Government
is playing its -last -card, andthat if this announcement by Li
Hung Chang does not stop the advance of the international col
umn it may be disavowed and that an effort may be made to
soften the wrath of the powers by opening communication with
Â¦the Ministers,' an indispensable preliminary to any negotiations.
This' hope is very slender, however, in view, of the fact that
the anti-foreign faction is in .control in Peking.. There is even
fear that .the Ministers .and other foreigners may yet be mur
dered. If Li Ping Hong is so firmly intrenched in power that ,
he does not hesitate to cut off the heads of members of the .
Tsung li Yamen for merely urging the preservation of the Min
isters, it is feared that , he might not hesitate ; long to 'kill all the
inmates of .the legations if the Â¦:Â¦ heroic 'marines are not able I to

Li Hung Chang's message . only increases "the -necessity for
'a rapid advance on Peking, if the -Ministers -and- other, foreigners
are to be rescued. J At- the same^time the administration sees
nothing in the situation calling : for a declaration of war. It is
still felt that the object of the powers '.can be best accomplished
without the' formal'declaration that a state of war exists. After
the Cabinet meeting to-day, one of those who participateid made
this statement for the administration: .
"Li Hung Chang's threat does not affect our position.- He
stated that until we accept the proposition to stop the advance
of the allied troops on condition of the removal of the Ministers
to Tientsin he would cease all further negotiations. Evidently
1 he has kept his word, for he now tells- the French Consul
that no message will be delivered to ; the Ministers because the
foreigners are advancing on Peking. Consul General Good
now's dispatch was given but simply as a matter of news, and
too much attention should not be paid to it. Li Hung Chang
has received our message. .'Â¦

to purchase 3000 cavalry and light bat

some to Africa. The occasion for ship

as a result of the recent wars, the price
has gone up materially. â

BATTLE WITH CHINESE
WASHINGTON, Aug. 3-â The opera
tions of the American forces In China are
seriously handicapped by the delay in the
landing of the cavalry horses, owing to
the lack of lighters and other small craft.
Two squadrons of the S^xth Cavalry ar
rived at Taku with General Chaffee on the
Grant peveral days ago, but in the ab
sence, of their mounts have been of no
further service than regularVoot troops,
and delay will occur in unloading horses
from the Lennox. Conemaugh and Le
lanaw. all on their way to China, It Is
estimated at the War . Department that
there are about3500 American troops, in
cluding 750 marines, in the vicinity of
Tientsin available for ~ active operations
against the Chinese capital, with pros
pects of 3000 reinforcements fromÂ».the
United States arriving in small detach
ments within the next two months. In
view of the small American representa
tion on the spot, it is not regarded at the
War Department as probable that General
Chaffee will be selected to command the
allied forces.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 3.-The Navy De
partment this morning received the fol
lowing cablegram from Admiral Remey:
"TAKU, Aug. 2.â Bureau of Navigation,

Admiral Rerney's report indicates that
serious resistance has developed to ,ihe
progress of the Peking relief column. His
advice confirms the opinion of the experts
here that the fights reported near Tien
tsin are "nothing more than the result of
reconnoissances. Still, a scouting party
800 strong is no Inconsiderable force, and
the fact that the Japanese suffered se
verely is regardf-d here as proof positive
that the relief column will have some
lively" fighting ahead. "
ONLY A KECONNOISSANCE.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 3.â It was stated
to-night that the dispatch received by the
War Department to-day from Major Gen
eral Chaffee, commanding the American
troops in China, was dated .Tientsin, July
31. At that time there had been no gen
eral forward "movement of the allied
forces, the only action having been a re
connolssance, presumably that reported
by Admiral Remey in the . dispatch re
ceived at the Navy Department in which
the Japanese lost several killed and had
a number wounded. .' -.kv Â¦ Â¦

with the statement from London pub

ANARCHY REIGNED
IN PEKING FOR MONTHS
Copyright, 190), by the Associated Press.
CHEFU. July 26 (via Shanghai. Aug. 2).-
The latest reports from Peking were
brought by "disaffected officers af the
Chinese army. They are considered re
liable. The officers left Peking: on July 15.
Thpy eay anarchy had reigned in Peking
for months and the streets ran blood, the
Chinamen tighting among themselves.
Yung Lu. commander in chief of the Chi
nese forces, and Prince Ching espoused*
the cause of the foreigners and endeav
ored with the part of the army loyal to
them in expf I the Boxors. Later, with the
majority of the imperial troops, under
ant!-foroign leaders, Princp Tuan and
General Tung Fuh Sian were victorious
and Yung Lu and Prince Ching, with their
followers, were prisoners In their yamens
when the bearers of >. these reports left
Peking. , -i
Prince Tuan and General Tung Fuh
Sian appear to control the Government,
according to thÂ£ officers, and issued edicts,
printed In the Gazette, exhorting the Chi
nese to kill all foreigners and native
Christnnp. One orticer says that there
are 16,000 troops in Peking, including
Tung's army, and 8000 more at Yung
Tsun. The soldiery hold all the streets
within a mile of the legations. The for
eign troops, when the officers left Peking,
had burned and abandoned the Chenmen
gate. Their ammunition -appeared to b*
failing and their quick-firing guns had
been silenced for some days before July li
anu they were using their rifles only when
hard pressed. The officers said that every
foreign bullet kills a Chinaman. The re
ports state that the American and English
troops engaged General Ma in a battle on
July 10.
The reports from Chinese sources are to
the effect that all the legations' forces
were killed. Chinamen caught a messen
ger who was trying to leave the legations
on July 10 with the following message:
"To any foreign commander: Make all
haste if you intend to save us. We can
hold out but a few days."

fore the way is clear to Peking.
The Navy to Co-operate.
The Navy Department to-day issued an
order for the co-operation of its officers
abroad with the officers of the army in
landing and transporting-. troops destined
for Chinese service. This revives the sit
uation that existed in Cuba when Shaf
ter's army corp3 was landed therethrough
the efforts of the navy. It is thought in
the department, that the navy can assist
General Chaffee, not only in the debarka
tion, but also by furnishing boat trans
portation if a move is made along the
Peiho.
Joint Memorial to Throne.
It appf-ars that some misunderstanding
exists ae to a St. Petersburg dispatch
printed here this morning saying the Chi
nese Minister there and his colleagues in
Europe had cabled the Governor of Shan
tunp. demanding that free communica
tion be opened between the Peking Minis
tors and their respective governments.
This communication was in fact a Joint
memorial' to the .throne, concurred in by
all Chinese Ministers abroad, including
Minister Wu in Washington. It was for
warded by Minister Yeng Lu at St. Pe
tersburg, because the latter Is dean of the
Chinese diplomatic service. It was trans
mitted through the Governor of Shantung,
to be forwarded to Peking. TfiTS action is
considered very important, as indicating
that the Chinese Ministers abroad have at
last reached a unanimous conclusion that
the situation is no longer to be trifled
with. Their action may be regarded as a
final effort on their part to influence their
Government, and its outcome is awaited
with great interest.
Communication "With. Peking.
Meanwhile the Government of the
United States, like the governments of
Europe, has not abandoned its efforts to
establish communication with its 'Minis
ter at Peking, and the State Department
has instructed. Consul General Goodnow
ut Shanghai, Consul Fowler at Chefu ami

move was made to-day in the
diplomatic situation by the re
turn of an evasive answer by
U Hung Chang to Secretary
Hay's peremptory demand of August 1 to
be put In' communication with the foreign
officials at Peking. L.i's answer is not
final and leaves the matter open to di
plomacy, but IA's action as reported by
Consul General Goodnow is unquestiona
bly sincere and will amount to a final
rejection of the American proposition, if

Mr. Goodnow's dispatch contains some
further information bearing on the ques
tion of the responsibility for Peking con
ditions in the statement that the comman
der of the Chinese troops by inference
answerable .to the Chinese Government
ordered the P.io Ting massacre. It is
learned, however, that Li Ping Hong, the
commander, is well known to all Chinese
officials as one of the most rabid anti
foreign loaders in China. lie is a close
friend of Prince Tuan, and the associa
tion of these, two in Peking affairs with
the power behind them to cause the igno
minious death of two high officials is re
garded here as a bad sign.
Characteristically Diplomatic.
| Simultaneously with Mr. Goodnow's
dispatch came a characteristically diplo
matic message from Yuan Shi Kai, the
Governor of Shantung, reporting the story
of two days ago that the Chinese Gov
ernment was arranging to deliver the
Ministers safely at Tientsin. Xo refer
ence is made to reconcile that statement
with Earl Li's refusal to allow communi
cation with the Ministers. General Chaf
fee's message as to the unexpected re
sistance offered to the Japanese reconnois
sance is regarded by military men here
as forecasting a greater degree of opposi
tion to the international advance than
had been anticipated and they are now

In addition to his short message rela
tive to the Japanese check transmitted
through Admiral Remey and received this
morning. General Chaffee made another
and direct cable report this afternoon.
The message was withheld from publica
tion by Secretary Root, who declines to
make its purport public. It was presum
ably devoted to a recital of General Chaf
fer's needs in a military way.
In view of the L.ondon statement that
the advance on Peking actually began
with the present week, there la also a pos
sibility that General Chaffee's message
has some bearing on that subject, though
it is thought the advance, if started, could
not have progressed far beyond Tientsin,

him. took place only ten miles out of

CONGER'S CIPHER
TELEGRAM GENUINE
' WASHINGTON, Auk. 3.-The State De
partment to-day issued the following:
* "The State Department has received a
dispatch from Mr. Fowler, Consul at Che
fu, dated at night on the 2d of August,
stating that when he learned from the
Shanghai papers that doubts were enter
tained of the genuineness of the Conger
cipher telegram he wired on the 27th to
the Governor of S!>antung>, to send him
the original by courier. The Governor at
once compiled with his request, sending
a special postman, who by traveling night
and day for five days made the Journey,
which 'in ordinary times would have re
quired twelve days. He^dellvered to Mr.
Fowler the original ' of the Conger dis
patch. It is' signed by Mr. Conger and
datedthe 17th of July. It is precisely .the
same as the message received at the State I
Department, with several words prefixed
which came in an unintelligible form to
the Chinese legation here. The dispatch
in Its complete form says that the mem
bers of the American legation had boen
besieged for a month in the British lega
tion. Mr. Fowler has no doubt of the gen
uineness of the dispatch."
Some interesting facts connected with
the original cipher message have been
brought to light by Mr. Fowler's .report*
It appears that when Minister Wu re
ceived the cipher message on the 2Jst ult.
he found that it contained a cipher within
a cipher. The Governor- of Shantung,
Yuan, transmitted with the. message a
message from the Tsung 11 Yamen, which
In turn transmitted Mr. Conger's message.
The latter was in the State Department
cipher; the former in the Chinese official
cipher. When Mr. Wu. in deciphering the
message, reached the end of the Tsung 11
Yamrn's message of -transmlttal he was
unaware of that fact and thought that the
several groups of figures following, were a
portion of the Tsung li Yamen's message.
As a matter of fact, they were the intitial
words of Mr. Conger's message and they
were undecipherable by Mr. Wu because
they were in the State Department cipher.
Instead of beginning "In British legation,"
etc.," Mr. Conger's message really began.
"We have been for a month in the British
legation."
Another fact developed is that the mes
sage was signed "E. H. Conger, July 17."
Many persons had supposed that whilo
the message was genuine it was one writ
ten by Mr. Conger -long before and that it
had been fraudulently dated by the Chi
nese officials. Now- It appears that the
Tsung 11 Yamen or Yuan did date it the
18th.
It is thought that this date was ac
curatÂ«, and that while Mr. Conger actu
ally wrote his dispatch on the 17th and
put It in cipher ready for transmission at
the first opportunity the message did not
leave Peking until the following day. The
developments have done much to rehabili
tate the Chinese officials in the estimation
of some of those who have heretofore
been very skeptical as to their integrity
in regard to the transmission of these of
ficial messages.

FRESNO, Aug. '3.â The Fresno County
Board of Horticultural Commissioners to
day filed reports showing that the vine
yards of the county have within the last
few weeks suffered great loss from the
ravages of the red spider. Efforts are
being made to check the ravages of the
insect, but it is estimated that at least a
third of the raisin crop will be destroyed.
The red spider attacks the leaves of the
grapevine, which they consume rapidly,
leaving the grapes exposed to the sun and
causing them to dry up before .they have
matured. The report of the Commission
ers is as follows:
"Since our June report was filed the red
spider or yellow? mite has rapidly in
creased and now spreads over the "entire
county, greatly damaging both trees and
vines; in fact, it Is our belief that as a
result the raisin output will be decreased
at least one-third. We have kept one man
constantly in the field directing the grow
ers in lighting this pest. In some In
stances they have sown their vines and
trees with sulphur by means of broadcast
seeders rigged on wagons. Many have
thus greatly reduced the ravages of the
pest, while others have, simply looked on
in amazement."

Charges Against Captain Buck

Vessel.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER. B. C. Aug. 3.â Captain
D. J. Mclnnes. who Â¦was the first officer
, of the steamer Alpha on her memorable
trip to Cape Nome early this season, made
a statement to-day that complicates the
position of the owners of the steamer,
who are now applying to the United States
Government to change her register to the
American flag. lie says the trip was car
ried out on the systematic plan of break
ing not only the United States coasting
laws, but the American customs regula
tions as well.
Captain Mclnnes says the owners never
had any intention of going to St. Michael,
the port for which they cleared, but in
tended to go to Cape Nome right from the
start. Nome was not a port of entry and :
It was unlawful for a British bottom to go
there, and she could never have obtained
clearance papers for Nome.
As chief officer, Mclnnes kept the log
book. He alleges that Captain Buckholtz
asked him to falsify the log to show that
they attempted to reach St. Michael, when
they did not. He also says that a con
signment of whisky and champagne was
smuggled ashore at Nome at night Just
before leaving for Vancouver. Captain
McTnnes also chefrges that another in
stance of the breaking of customs laws
was the taking north ol two scows in sec
tions, which Â¦were put together at Nome.
They were worth $1000 apiece, and not a
cent of duty was ever intended to be or
was ever paid on them. He further says
that food supplies ran short in Bering Sea
and (instead of buying more at Dutch
Harbor the ship's stores were taken out
of the consignments of goods in the hold.

that the report filed by Dr. Ryfkogel

BIG STRIKE
ON CANADIAN
PACIFIC LINE
Fifteen Hundred MacWnists
and Fitters Leave tlie
Shops.
BOTH SIDES STATE THE CASE
Mechanics Claim Their Wage Is Too
Small, and Superintendents Say
Men Have No Just Cause.
Special Dispatch to Tha Call.
VANCOUVER, B. C. Augr. 3.â From
Fort William, the headquarters of the
Lake Superior division of the Canadian
Pacific Railway, to the western terminus
at. Vancouver every machinist and fitter
has gone out on strike. In Vancouver
eighty men have left their work,
and this Is the case all through.
British Columbia, the Northwest and
Manitoba, Between 1200 and 1500 men
are now out, and If the strike Is not set
tled within a few days other mechanics
probably will quit work, thus swelling the
total number to over three thousand.
With only the machinists out trains would
probably be able to run without trouble;
but if all the carshop men Join the
strikers in sympathy with the general
movement the railway system would be
paralyzed within a few days.
The strike trouble has been browing' for
a long time. It began last November,
when the boilermakera at the Central
machine shops at Winnipeg went out on
strike. They had a long series or griev
ances against the company and a tem
porary arrangement was then* come to
with General Western Manager White.
Manager White returned three daya ago
to Winnipeg from a tour of China and
now has another strike on his hands. In
Vancouver the men claim they have causa
for a strike. ThreÂ» weeks ago William
MacClaln. president of the Machinists*
Union, was discharged because he was
taking too active a part against the can
nerymen In the salmon fishermen's strike
on the Fraser River. Then, out of the
eighty machinists employed In the shops
In Vancouver, fifty were discharged the
other day on grounds that, owing to the
failure of the Manitoba wheat crop, the
company must reduce expenses and there
would be much less work for the shops.
This morning the thirty remaining ma
chinists and fitters laid down their tools
In response to a telegram from the head
quarters at Winnipeg. One of the princi
pal local grievances Is that the company
refuses to treat with the men In their
request for a raise of wages from 12 80
to $3 per day. MacClaln, president of the
union, said to-day:
In May last the machinists asked the com
pany to adopt their schedule of prices and the
rules that had been arranged by the union.
The company refused at that time to treat with
th<- machinists and said they could not afford
to Increase wages owing to the partial failure
of thÂ« wheat crop in the Xorthwest. Frequently
during the pant few months the company has
been requested to adopt the union schedule, but
thÂ» tame reply was always given â the company
declined to treat with the union. We ask an
increase from 2S cents to SO cents per hour.
Men have also been discharged for representing
fellow-workmen on commlttemi of investigation.
We were refused the privilege of laying a
grievance before the general management at
Winnipeg and the free paasage of a delegate
was stopped.
General Superintendent Marpole said
to-day that the men here had gone out on
instructions from "Winnipeg, and here
they did not know what they were strik
ing for. He thought the local grievances
were trivial and that the whole trouble
emanated from Winnipeg. It was pecu
liar, he said, that men should go on strike
and not know what It was for.
There was no demonstration when the
men quit work this morning.
MOUNTAIN RESERVE FIRES
ARE DUE TO INCENDIARIES
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Such Is the Uglu Rumor Current in Los Angeles,
Where Great Watersheds Mau Be Devastated,
fop the Flames Are Gaining-
Fuller Is a Friend to Gage.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN DIEGO, Aug. 3.â The announce
ment that the appointment to the vacant
position on the Superior bench Is this
county is to go to George Fuller creates
little surprise, as his name was the first
mentioned for the position when the news
of the death of Judge Hughes in Wash
ington was first announced. He la a
warm personal friend of Governor Gage
and It has been known that the Governor
would be glad to naine-'him for any posi
tion he would accept. Mr. Fuller has
been practicing law here since 1S87 and
has been mentioned as a candidate for
the nomination by the Republicans at sev
eral conventions. He Is now a member of
the firm of Fuller & RIall.
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 3.â The fire In the
mountains appears to be gaining on the
fighters and is raging worse than ever.
And now come stories of incendiarism.
As seen from this city to-night the flames
appear to be nearer the foothills than at
any time since they started.
Eatons Canyon, the watershed that sup
plies Pasadena with water, Is In the great
est danger, as the flames have Invaded the
canyon. Every man. who can be secured
by the city officials and Board of Trade of
the Crown City is being sent to the scene.
If money can check the flames, plenty of
it is on hand and there will be no lack of
men if men can be hired. There Is no-di
rect news from the fire, but a party is
coming out, who will probably reach Pas
adena during the nignt, when It will be
known how great a foothold the flames
have obtained in Eatons Canyon, which
is recognized as one of the most Impor
tant watersheds in Southern California.
The Monrovia Peak lire Is also unsub
dued. W. M. gturtevant is directing the
fighters there in the hope of saving west
Fork and Stui tevants Camp. At the best,
the situation is such as to cause grave
anxiety by every water user in Pasadena.
Not to carelessness or accident alone is
attributed the widespread havoc wrought
by the fire In the San Gabriel forest re
serve. To the act of criminal negligence,
to which, with apparent justness, is
ascribed the origin of the conflagration
that has been raging in the mountains
north of Sierra Madre for nearly two
weeks, now Is added the crime of incen
diarism, according to late reports from the
scene of'the fire in the Little Santa Anita
Canyon. If these reports be true, the fire
which broke out afresh In the Little Santa
Anita Wednesday afternoon was deliber
ately set in three different places by some
miscreant.
Forest Ranger Arthur Carter, Ranger
Phil Begue and other smoke-begrimed cit
izens, who are battling valiantly with the
flames in Little Santa Anita Canyon, are
firmly convinced that Wednesday's unex
pected outbreak was not accidental. Com
ing so soon after the strike of a body of
fire-fighters,, who mutinied without any
apparent cause except a possible disincli
nation to give value received in work for
the stipend allowed them by the Govern
ment, there would appear to be ground
for suspicion of insendlarlsm, even If
there were no posltve evidence to that
effect. But there is evidence that such
deviltry has been committed, although
the author of the crime may never be
ferreted out.
Barn and Horses Are Burned.
SAN itAFAEL, Aug. 3.â An incendiary
fire started on the ranch of Thomas.
O'Connor, near San Quentln. early this
morning. Before the flames could be got
ten under control ' $6000 of damage had
been done. A hundred and fifty tons of
hay, seventy-five hogs, four horses and
several wagons were burned. The Insur
ance is $1000. Officers will investigate.
Grain Fire at Lodi.
LODI, Aug. 3. â A grain fire on the Barn
hart ranch here to-day caused a loss of
about 75 acres of standing grain. The fire
is supposed to have been started by a
spark from a passing train.' Section hands
did service in preventing the spread of the
flames. Â¦Â¦-Â¦Â¦-.Â¦Â¦Â¦ -Â¦
expectations the Fitzgerald murder case
did not go to the jury to-day. The de
fendant was upon the stand from about
1:30 o'clock yesterday afternoon until ad
journment, all this morning and part of
this afternoon, most of the time being oc
cupied In cross-examination". He was
made to repeat over and over again the
minutest details of the tragedy and the
various conversations had between him
and Lennon.
The time occupied in taking rebuttal
testimony was very short, and all the tes
timony was in and the case ready for
argument about 3 o'clock. The rest of
the time up to adjournment was occupied
by District Attorney Bullock in arguing
the case to the Jury.
Mr. Boardmin will commence the argu
ment for the defendant upon the opening
of court to-morrow morning and will
probably consume two hours, so that the
case will not be submitted to the Jury
before to-morrow afternoon.
ALASKA BOUNDARY
WORK IS COMPLETE
Delimitation Commissioners Say the
Provisional Line Has Been
Marked Satisfactorily.
Special . Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA. B. C, Aug. 3--Members of
the Boundary Delimitation Commission,
which has been marking the provisional
boundary on the Chilkoot, Chllcat and
White passes, arrived by the steamer
Queen, which returned from Alaskan
points to-night, and In Interviews the
Commissioners, W. F*. King, for Great
Britain, and O. T. Tittman for America,
said the work had been completed to the
satisfaction of all. The last work was
done on the summit of the Chilkoot, and
Tittman said the towns of Dyea and
Sheep Camp were deserted.
A mysterious tragedy, believed to be a
murder bv Indians, Is reported from
Halnes. The body of George Metcalf, a
trapper, who. with one Nelson, as partner,
had been catching foxes near Halnes, was
found nine miles from the town much de
composed, and Nelson cannot be found.
The Coroner's inquest could not ascribe
the cause of death, but the prevailing
opinion was that he had been murdered by
Indians, who were known to have threat
ened him and his partner. What has be
come of Nelson is unknown.
The steward who was drowned in the
Florence S disaster was Walter Monaste*
of Skaguay. Monastes was standing on
the deck with Captain BarringtonÂ»when
the steamer turned turtle and was as cool
as any one on board. He admonished all
not to get excited and worked hard to
rescue the passengers. He was an excel
lent swimmer and remained on top of the
water for some time, but finally disap
peared and was seen no more. Charley
Sinclair, well known in Skagnay. where
he worked during 1S9S and the following
spring as a packer and who was familiar
ly known as "Caribou," was the hero of
the hour. He was on the illfated craft
at the; time of the accident, but landed
in the water right s!de up. He caught an
upturned boat belonging to the ship float
ing near .him and righting the same
picked up nearly all the passengers and
crew that were saved, paddling between
wreck and shore with one broken oar and
carrying three persons at a time. Xo
bodies have been recovered.

REDWOOD CITY, Aug. 8.â Contrary tp
An investigation at the point where "Wilson" attempted to kill himself dis
closed the fact that his clothing had been destroyed by the fire. In the ashes
In the bottom of the stump the searchers found a cheap nickel watch, a white
handled knife, a revolver of the bulldog pattern, a pair of steel rimmed glasses.
J12 13 in coin and an empty vial with the name "Wm. J. Bryan, Chemist, San
Francisco," blown In the bottle.
Diligent Inquiry In Oakland last night failed to give any clew to the identity
of the man who tried to kill himself at Guerneville.
Allen Morse, a camper from Oakland, declares that the would-be suicide is a
resident of Oakland and that his family is well-known in that city. He is about
26 years old. From Morse's statements it is further gathered that "Wilson"
is a bookkeeper in one of the hardware stores of Oakland.
To-day the man's brother and sister arrived here, but refused to make any
statement or give their names. They took the despondent brother with them
when they left several hours later.
To questions as to his Identity he gave the name of George "Wilson. He said
he was a lawyer of San Francisco, but had not been practicing his profession
for several years, owing to ill health. The cause of his attempt at self destruc
tion, he said, was despondency. He further said that four years ago he had at
tempted to take his life.
Half an hour later Restaurant Proprietor John Hansen was startled to see a
piny, naked man sway at his doorway a moment and then fall heavily. Han
sen ran out and the man implored him to get a doctor, as he had taken poi
son. A physician was hastily summoned and by the use of antidotes the
strang-er -was soon out of danger.
GUERNEVILLE, Aug. 3.â Suicide by poison and fire was the fate chosen for
himself by an unknown young man who came to Guerneville last night. After
swallowing a big dose of cocaine he took off his clothing, made a bonfire of it
in a hollow stump and then climbed into the stump to be cremated. But he still
lives because the courage to carry out his grim resolution failed him.
It was about 7 o'clock last night that a man who gave his name later as
Georpe Wilson, which is believed, however, to be fictitious, climbed a steep hill
side about a mile south of Guerneville. He rested for a few minutes when he had
come to a big hollow tree stump. Then he swallowed twenty grains of cocaine,
according to Ms statement. This done, he removed all his clothing and care
fully piled it in the hollow stump and made a bonfire of it. The poison having
begun to take effect on him, he crawled into the etump and lay down, to furnish
a eensation for Sonoma County. ' '
His Intentions were deadly enough, and he thought that the flames of the
blazir.g stump would consume his body and all his belongings, thus destroying
nil trace of himself or his fate. But when the flames began to flare higher, the
intense heat roused him from the lethargy cauted by the poison, and he crawled
out of the self constructed furnace. Dazed and scorched, naked as the day he
came into the world, he stood there in the night breeze, and all his nerve left
him. He turned and staggered down the hills.

Delivers an Address to a Large and Enthusiastic Audience
That Applauds the Sentiments of the Speaker.
TEMPERANCE DAY AT GARFIELD
PARK'S CHRISTIAN CONVENTION
LAYTONVILLE, Aug. 3.â The posse in
the expedition, headed by Sheriff Taylor
of Marin County, in pursuit of Murderer
King, arrived here to-day from the moun
tains. All the members of the pursuing
party were In an exhausted condition, due
to the intense heat and the trials Incident
to mountain travel. The posse shows no
discouragement and promises to organize
a more determined pursuit to-morrow.
It is understood a good clew has been
found by the other posse, under the
leadership of Officer Grubb, who went
north to Bell Springs Wednesday, and is
now hot after King through a blind trail
leading- into Covelo and thence to Trinity
County. Sheriff Taylor and his men say
to-night they will meet Officer Grubb's
posse in the mountains early to-morrow
and co-operate with him. The following
route of Sheriff Taylor's hunt, as, related
by himself, will convey an adequate Idea
of the great amount of traveling they did:
From Ukiah north to WIHits; thence
southeast to Cahto; crossed Eel River;
thence north to Red Mountain; thence
north to Bell Springs; thence west to Leg
gett Valley; thence back to Laytonville,
with all trace of King lost.
Sheriff Taylor declares no one can have
a Just appreciation of the magnitude of
the chase until he has traveled over those
chemessal mountains, going through
places where scarce a grizzly bear would
attempt to force his way.
In speaking of Murderer King, the
Sheriff states it is not generally known
that when King shot a man some years
ago he immediately escaped to his father
in-law's ranch, near Skaggs Springs, where
he enlisted the services of a half-breed
Indian employed on the ranch to pilot him
through the less frequented trails Into
Trinity County. Taylor asserts he has
positive evidence now that this same half
breed Indian is assisting In King's flight.
The mountain passes off from the main
highways are so cut up into blind trails,
sheltered by dense., timber, that, with
the aid of an experienced guide. King can
easily escape. Taylor says the reputa
tion of the half-breed Indian guide is
such that should the posse surround them
a bloody fight will ensue. The general
opinion of the officers is that if King were
alone he would have been captured long
ago.
Officer Grubb. the leader of. the Trinity
County posse, sends in the news that he la
on a good trail of two men going over the
mountain pass from Mendocino into Trin
ity County, and has information that one
of the men is a half-breed Indian. This
Information received by Sheriff Taylor to
night has acted as a sort of stimulus on
all connected with the pursuit, which will
be vigorously beeun at daylight. Taylor
declares he will not return without his
man, being fully convinced that he is on
the right trail.
DECLARE IT IS KING.

in the Powers case to-da^-, all but one was I
called for the purpose of attacking the
credibility of witnesses * placed on the
stand bv the prosecution.
The most important witness of the day
was Daniel R.- Collier of Lancaster, adju
tant general of Kentucky under the Tay
lor administration. He offered as testl
monv the written orders ofGovernor Tay
lor directing: him to bring the regiments
of the State Guard to Frankfort atter the
shooting of Goebel and ordering him to
confer with the civil authorities of Frank- I
lln County as to how best to preserve
peace there. This was the first appearance
of the document, which was never made
part of the State records, and Judge
Cantrlll ruled it out as Incompetent on the
objection of the prosecution that it was
not in accordance with the statutes of the
State, not directing Collier to place the
military under direction of the civil au
thorities.
The purported confession Of "Tallow
Dick" Combs, one of the alleged conspira
tors, exhibited here to-day was at. first
denied by him, but later he admitted to
one of the Interested attorneys that it Is
partially correct. The confession, if true,
throws no .further light on the case 'than
to connect Henry Youtsey, another of the
alleged conspirators, more closely with
the murder and to bear out the Idea of a
conspiracy.

most successful ever held her*. Tbe 2:13
pace was the best race ot the day. There

BONNIE DIBECT'S GOOD WOBK.
NEW YORK, Aug. 3.â A World special
from London says: 'William "Waldorf, As
tor stands to-day as a man without a
country. English society has turned its
back upon him and people who were wild
to Â¦ go to his sumptuous entertainments
last season now sneer openly at him. He
is now about to quit England for a year
and perhaps for good.
His apology to Sir Berkeley Milne has
not disarmed the hostile members of the
Marlborough Club, who have openly
avowed that Astor's slight to Sir Berke
ley was a slight to them all.
All through the week the club commit
tee has been in session upon a demand
signed by 180 members of that organiza
tion to take up the slight to Sir Berkeley
Milne with a view to expelling Astor. Only
the Prince of Â¦'Wales' tact and good feel-
Ing has temporarily saved Astor. He sug
gested the postponement of the entire
business until alter the Goodwood races,
which was done.
"Let's give this antl-Astor feeling a
chance to simmer down," he said, and of
course it was done at once at his com
mand. . . Â¦ : .
Meanwhile the millionaire Is practically
ostracized socially. - He was not invited to
the Queen's garden party this year,
though in the past he has been an hon
ored guest. This means that he has fallen
from high social estate; for to be the
Queen's guest is .to be among the elect.
It is frankly admitted at Clivedon, Astor'o
splendid villa on the Thames, that he will
not be a tenant this autumn, as has been
his custom, but will go over to the Conti
nent for a year at least. There he may
escape somewhat the social cloud under
which he now tinds himss^f.
His magazine property, the Pall Mall
Gazette, is in the market, too, and brokers
say it can be had at a very reasonable
figure â much less than the outlay already
made upon it. -
More honor has come to Sir Berkeley
llilne in proof that royalty condemns
Astor's affront. He/has been selected by
the Duke of York, as one of the six senior
naval ottlcers to represent the British
navy at the funeral of the Duke of Saxe-
Coburg.
If Astor quits England for good, as
many say he must, he will be in a queer
position. He will practically be a man
without a country, though with many
millions. The question Is, "What country
will he seek next?

LINCOLN, Nt-br., Aup. 3.-William J.
Bryan to-day concluded the writing of his
ppceeh to be made at Indianapolis next
Wednesday In accepting the Democratic
nomination for the Presidency, lie spent
the entire day in this work, giving no time
to calk-rs. The speech is about S000 words
in length. He has adhered to his original
intention Of devoting the document almost
entirely to me question of imperialism.
In following this course he pursues the
general plan adopted in lS'.^ of sivins es
pecial attention in his notilication speech
to the pubjec-t made paramount by the
Democratic platform. For this reason the
policy of the Government with reference
to the acquisition of foreign territory will
thus be Riven the place of prominence
which was allotted to the ilnancial ques
tion in 1896, the other subjects being left
to be dealt with in the letter of acceptance
to be given out later. The remarks upon
this subject are based upon the adminis
tration's conduct of affairs in the Philip
pine archipelago.
It is now Bryan's intention to remain in
Chicago for several days, possibly a
week after the Indianapolis meeting, the
entire time to be given to conferences
with leaders of all the forces supporting
him.
Vice Chairman Edmiston of the Na
tional Populist Committee to-day issued
a call to the executive committee of that
party to meet In Chicago on the day fol
lowing the Indianapolis meeting. Mr.
Edmiston declined to state the purpose of
this meeting, but there is little doubt that
its principal object is to confer with
Bryan and other leaders, possibly with a
view of deciding what course shall be pur
sued with reference to Towne's candidacy
for the Vice Presidency.

new employment and became more com

the question of existence was a difficult
one for him. What his punishment will
be is a matter if doubt. Probably it will
be a life FÂ«mcnce at hard labor, though
It is possible he will be condemned to the

MONZA. Aug. 3.â The remains of King
Humbert were to-day placed In a casket
of walnut covered with lead and glass in
such a manner as to leave the face ex
posed. The ceremony which took- place in
the presence of the royal family was very
touching. Queen Margherita placed the
Italian flag with the arms of the House
of Savoy over the corpse. ,

BRUSSELS, Aug. 3.â In reply to the note
of the British Government expressing re
gret that the proceedings against Slpido,
the assailant of the Prince of Wales,
should have had such an utterly inade
quate ending, the Belgian Government
says that as a strict observer of the laws
it was unable to violate them, however
strong its desire to- proceed rigorously
against the culprit-
According to Belgian law, the reply
points out, Slpido, like any other young
man placed at the disposal of the Gov
ernment, and having alleged domicile In
Belgium, had three days to appeal to the
Court of Cassation. Living with his par
ents, ho had legal "domicile; and, there
fore, he could not be- arrested for. three
days. He profited by the delay to take
flight. . Â¦

"The Group of Existence held a meet-

long secret session. Those present were
Bressi, Quintavalll, 'Graisoni and Al
phonso Rlandinis, Steve and Wldmar, the
editor of the paper issued by the group,
and one or two others. These men talked
over a trip which Bressi, Quintavalli,
Graisoni (Lanna) and some others were to
take. The meting was held to read a let
tor from Count Malatesta. There were
also letters from Genoa and Paris. Quin
tavalli left Paterson after the meeting,
which ended early in the morning. Bressi
also left, but came back on May 12 and
collected- his money at the silk mill."
NEW .YORK, Aug. 3.â To-night in a
saloon in Straight street, Paterson, N. J.,
an Italian, whose name does not appear
to be known to the proprietor of the place,
said he knew of a meeting held in that
city early in May which he intended to
inform the authorities of. The story he
told was:
This solidity of thought and affection will
always be the most certain bulwark of my
reign and the best guarantee of the unity of
the eountry. Such are my hopes, such is my
ambition as citizen and as Kins.
SIGNIFICANT MEETING
HELD JN PATERSON
Italians, render your tribute of tears and
honors to the sacred memory of Humbert of
Savoy. You, in the bitter sorrow which has
struck my house, have shown that 'you con
sider this sorrow as though it were that of
each individual among you.
My reign shall be outlined by these Imperish
able remembrances. May God aW me and may
the- love of my people fortify me so that I
may consecrate all my cares as a King to th'j
guardianship of liberty and the defense of the
monarchy, united by indissoluble bonds for the
supreme Interest of the country.
'I am certain of the prosperity and grandeur
of the. country. It was the glory or my grand
father to have given Italy its unity and in
dependence. It was the glory of my father
to have jealously guarded this unity ana this
Independence to the end.
The second King: of Italy Is dead. Escaping,
thanks to his valor as a soldier, the danger oÂ£
hattle. 'and departing unharmed, thanks to
Providence, from the risks he confronted to
courageously to end public calamities, this
Kpod and virtuous King: fell -a. victim, to-atro
cious crime, while: with easy conscience and
without fear of danger he was participating
in the joys of his people at their fetes.
It . wa , s not permitted to me to be present
at the last breath of my father, but T under
stand my first .duty to be to follow the coun
sels he left me and to imitate. the virtues of
the King- and first citizen of Italy.-
In this moment of profound sadness I have
to aid me the strength which comes from the
examples of my august father and of that great
I\Ing who dtaerves to be called the "father of
his country. Â¦. I. have also . as a support the
strength which comes from the love and de
votion of the Italian people for the . King
tvhdm they venerated and weep for.
There remain to us the institutions which he
loyally preserved and which he attempted to
render permanent during the twenty-two years
of his.reiKn. These institutions are given to
me as the sacred traditions of my house and
the wram love which Italians have for then?,
protected with a firm and energetic hand from
assault- or any violence from whatever source
It comes, assures me.

The Earl of Selborn was questioned In
the House of Lords concerning the alleged
treasonable correspondence, and in reply
read the explanation which Mr. Chamber
lain had made In the House of Commons.
In his opinion the letters were not trea
sonable, though certainly Improper, while
her Majesty was engaged in difficult nego
tions. It is proposed to send the letters to
the writers and ask if they desire to ex
plain and he would await a reply before
deciding whether to publish them or not.
"In the morning a flag of. truce came to
Smith-Dorien's camp, demanding his sur
render. Before he could reply the Boers
opened a heavy fl*r. The British losses
were slight.
"Ian Hamilton met with slight loss at
Vitbols Nek. His casualties were light."
In response to questions the Secretary
for the Colonies, Joseph Chamberlain,
said to-day in the House of Commons
that the Boer Governments In fleeing from
Bloemfontein and Pretoria left masses of
official correspondence among the. archives
which the authorities on the spot were ex
amining. He had received installments of
this correspondence by the last two mails,
and he had been Informed that more Is to
come. The portions he bad seen were writ
ten previous to the war and were chiefly
letters of British subjects of tbe Cape and
of the two republics. There were, howi
ever, copies of two letters that purported
to have been written by an English mem
ber of the House of Commons and the let
ters and an extract from a letter written
by two members of the House of Com
mons two days before the outbreak of thÂ«
war, couched in the form of open criti
cism, asking for information regarding
martial law and suggesting that President
Kruger make temporary concessions and
await a reaction In England.

LONDON, Aug. 3. â In the House of Lords to-day Lord Rosebery resented
the Secretary of State for War (the Marquis of Lansdowne) taking him to task
for suggesting that the commander of the forces, Lord Wolseley, ought to
rome to the House and give his authority to the Government's mifflary
plans. Lord Rosebery said he did not propose to be snubbed in the dis
charge of what he considered a public duty. The Marquis of â¢ Lansdowne, he
said, must be disabused of the idea that there existed in. the country a blind,
VieneraUns confidence In the War Office. , '
The Marquis of Lansdov.-ne, replying, said the War Secretary was res? -i
sible to Parliament and the commander In chief was responsible to the War
Secretary. Â¦. Â¦.,.':â¢
Other peers having spoken, the Premier, Lord Salisbury, said he under
stood Lord Rosebery's contention was that the nation would be much' more
satisfied if Lord Wolseley would come to the House and express his ap-~
proval of Lord I^ansdovrae's plans. It was obvious that if Lord Wolseley
could be called upon to do that he was -also entitled to express disapproval.
Lord Salisbury said he could not see how that was possible. There was much
force In what Lord Rosebery had said, but it was of an abstract kind.
The subject was then dropped. â¢ 'Â¦.."-/'-
ST. PAUL, Minn.,' Aug. 3.â President J. J. Hill's scheme for a big steam

The. purpose of 'the company, as stated, is the building and operatlonof

I â¢ Sons met at the Palace Hotel on Wednesday evening and discussed the
I championship races to be held on September 9. The arrangements are
â¢ progressing satisfactorily, and as handsome and unusually valuable prizes
will be given in the various events there will be a long entry list. It has
been decided that the contestants must wear caps of the same color for each
club, so that the spectators may De aole easily to distinguish the crews. The
Ariels. Alamedas and South Ends will enter senior, intermediate and junior barge
crews, while the Dolphins and Pioneers will also enter crews. There will be
entries in the shell and outrigged skiff'events from nearly all the clubs. A. W
Pape of the Dolphin Boating Club and the Olympic Athletic Club will pul! in hi3
new boat in the senior shell race.
It is doubtful whether any members of the South End Rowing Club will be
seen at the Astoria regatta. The "Irish" barge crew cannot go. and J. P. Foley.
who contemplated v the trip, will probably be unable to go on account of business
engagements and the postponement of ihe regatta till later in the month.
The Dolphins may send a barge crew and three single scullers to Astoria, tho
latter being A. XV. Pape. George Baker and T. J. Kennedy. The Olympics also
ha\-e two crews which are willing to go north. Thus it jÂ«ma that the regatta
committee of the Pacific Association will have plenty of candidates from whom
to choose. The Alameda senior barge crew is In training and will try its muscle
at Astoria. F. \\L Ayers will pull In the outraged skiff race there. A. \V. Pape
will take his new 'shell if he can get a fair allowance for expenses and the offer
of a good prize. He will row against the Portland man. \V. J. Patton or In a
special match against any amateur sculler. He will also take jpart In a life-sav
ing exhibition with Sidney Cavill of the Olympic Club.
S. Adderley is practicing in the outrigged skiff, but as both he and TV* O
Patch have just returned from their vacations they cannot get the timo for a visit
to the north. E. Cashman of the South Ends is doing good wcrk in the skiff
but will not be seen in competition until the Admission day regatta.
A great deal of discussion is going on about the outrigged skiff. Al Rogers
the Alameda boat builder, is desirous to construct a lighter jkiff than the one
now in use, conforming in length to the requirements of the dctlnitlrn of the Pa
cific Association, but "beating the rule" by having washboards. The regatta
committee has decided that the six laps called for by the rule must be in a con
tinuous line. The Alameda Boat Club was about to order a new skiff of very light
construction, but as there Is danger of the Wiat when built tfinn d'squrrfified for
championship races the club will probably refrain and content itself with skiff3
of the present type.

Notes From the Kennel.
To Callfornians a bench show without
Dave Sinclair would seem abnormal.
Dave has been selected to act a3 clerk of
the forthcoming show at Sacramento, and
Intending exhibitors will consequently feel
assured that everything connected with
the management will be properly per
formed. E. M. Simpson, the secretary,
expects to have the premium lists issued
by the 10th of this month. A large entry
is confidently anticipated.
H. C. Golcher, who was elected , as one
of the bench show committee of the Tan-Â»
foran show, will be unable to serve, and
Richard Rountree. the secretary of the
Pacific Bull Terrier Club, has been elected
in his stead. It is probable that Judge
N. Post of Sacramento, who Is well known
in connection with field trials, will judge
the field trial competitions at Tanforan.
The conditions of entry for these compe
titions are far from onerous and a large
entry should result.

Frisco's Three Victories Over
Champions Please
Fans.
The Joyful, eelf satisfied facial expres-
Blon that local fanatics carried away with
them last Sunday after the game between
Ean Francisco and Sacramento made
Hank Harris think he was the Mayor of
San Francisco and the sole proprietor
of a new charter that worked smoothly
and well. Of course, the surprise Â¦ was
great, but good strong reasons prevail for
Ean Francisco's victories and Sacramen
to's unbroken eerial defeat.
For a month the "pretzel" team has
been playing good baseball, the kind that
denotes earnestness and interest in the
work. The errors have* been few, the
etickwork excellent and the base running
scientific. Unless Hank's men strike a to
boggan and slide from the standard set
by their late playing, they will complete

individual material, played Buch ball that
the blood in the veins of fanatics grew
thick. But now the team has settled and
has really become a team.
.But what has come over the champions?
They played together before the last se
ries. Then came the change. Devereaux's
absence was certainly not the cause of
all the ragged work of the Senators. Dur
ing the last series the visitors were dis
organized and they, will have to pull to
gether to reach champion form.
Iburg Bhowed himself a great twlrler in
the games against Sacramento. On Sat

DEER HUNTERS ON

BUCKS PLENTIFUL
Country Club Members Play
Practical Joke on Peter
Martin.
The deer hunters are In the midst of
their seasonal sport and reports from tho
neighboring counties in which the game
laws allow ,free hunting bespeak a fair
measure of good luck and success. This
is the walking season for the bucks, and
they are coming out within range and ac

Some fine sport fell to the Country Club
members who left this city last Saturday
and Sunday for the Marln County pre

Jackson, William Bsrg. William Kitttle.
Alec Hamilton, Peter Martin, F. W. Van
Sicklen and William Gerstle, a guest of
the club, scoured the hills last SundAv
and six bucks were brought into the club
hou?e. The lucky ones were Jackson,
Hamilton, Berg, Kittle, Gerstle and Van
Sicklen.
Peter Martin did not get a deer, but he
came close to it. Two of his friends stuck
an antler-mounted head In the brush
and by soft phrase goaded Martin into a
genuine buck fever. He blazed away at
It with grim determination to bring down
his game. After the tilth phot the head
tumbled to the ground. When Martin re

his lot upon these waters.

AFTER being o'utrigged-skiff champion for two years, Alex \V. Pape of the Dolphin and Olympic clubs has
become thc-owner of the most beautiful shell ever built on this coast. It is of Spanish cedar, one-four
teenth of an inch in thickness. ' Her outriggers are of galvanized iron, red enameled, and all the fittings
are nickel-plated. This shell was built by Al Rogers, the boat-builder of Alamcda Point, and cost $175. To
give her stability she has a fin of brass, which "makes her a very seaworthy craft. The decks fore and aft are of
Irish linen, oiled and varnished. The slides were specially constructed by Rogers. Alex Pape brought the shell
over from Alameda last Sunday on the ferry-boat, and put her into the water near the ferry slip. He then pulled
along the water front, and, though the weather was rough and the craft shipped a .leal of" water, she baled herself
'and came through splendidly.
This is more than an extraordinary shell. It has been in process of construction for a period of time ex
tending over a year. Every joint, every fastening, every seam, was gone over again and again, until to-day it
stands as a model piece of work. The oarsmen who have seen Pape's new shell pronounced it the very finest ever
afloat on Pacific Coast waters. Â»

Joe Watkins, a former coursing man' of

effort to introduce the game to the people
of that section. When Watkins left for
the north. some months ago he left his
string of dogs in charge of his trainers.
On several occasions the hounds which
were entered In Watkins' name acted
badly and were suspected of being doped
though nothing could be proved against
them. Finally Merciless, one of the string,
was brought on the 'ileld at Ingleslde In
a condition which plainly showed that the
dog had been overloaded with, dope. * The
"prep" had such effect on the animal that
dog handlers were afraid to touch him.
The association made an investigation,
which resulted in the ruling oft of one of

i a T 1T:53 this afternoon the preparatory E"un will be fired, and at 1 o'clock
/\ the starting signal will be given for the race for the San Francisco Per
/""\ pctual Challenge cup. The trophy, now held by the San Francisco Yacht
Club, was won on September 23 of last year by Matthew Turner's sloop
Gadder, sailed by Commodore and Supervisor "W. X. McCarthy, and de-
Seating J. \V. Pew's Truant. The Gadder will be the defender In this year's race,
the challenging club being represented by Carl Westerfeld and R. H. .Morrow's
sloop Aeolus. The Gadder will be 6ailed by C. Chapman, vice commodore of the
Vallejo Yacht Club, and his crew will consist of F. Erlcsen, Joseph Ellis and
Thomas Connelly, who are employed In Matthew Turner's shipyard at Benlcia.
She will also carry a member of the San Francisco Yacht Club. The challenger
will be sailed by Carl Westerfeld. whose crew will consist of J. C. Brickell, F. E.
Schober, J. Short and R. H. Morrow. By agreement of the regatta committees of
:he Corinthian and San Francisco clubs the Corinthian challenger will not have on
Â£oard a member of the San Franciscos. ncr will the San Francisco defender carry
a Corinthian as a representative of the Tiburon Club. C. Chapman and his crew
have been practicing with light sails at I^enicla and are said to have become
quite expert. Carl Westerfeld has been over the course in the Aeolus, studying
the currents and eddiesâ knowledge of which is very valuable In a close race.
The event will be entirely under the management of the regatta committee? of

under the rules published in 1S77 by that club. The rules are somewhat antique
end do not cover all the points that might arise, but they are the only rules the
Fan Franciscos have. The Corinthian?, while they cannot complain of direct un
fairness, feel that the sloop Gadder, ownod and sailed at Benicla by a profes

not 88 genuine a San Francisco boat as the Aeolus is a Corinthian one. The
Aeolus is owned by two attorneys, one of whom has been commodore of the Cor

among our people that any one. however
inexperienced, is fit to be intrusted with
the administration of our exhibitions;
abroad is based upon a very obvious fal-'
lacy. The exhibit itself must expose at
the same time not only its Intrinsic merit
but incidentally the Industrial conditions
which attend its creation. A product,
whatever its merit may be. which has
been 'brought into existence in total dis
regard of the health, happiness and pros
perity of the men who create It has no
value as an Industrial illustration since
the penalty of its production would be the
degradation of labor.
This great exposition Is In its highest
France inaugurated a series of indus
trial and commercial tournaments, the
first of which was held, as already Indi
cated, in 1S19. By an inevitable evolution
ary process the exhibitions of France have
risen to the dignity of broad sociological
as well as industrial contests.
Suppose we had applied these conditions
to the production of wine in California.
There Is no country where the labor em
ployed receives a higher reward than In
our own country. There is no country
where the civil and religious rights of the
laborer are more respected than in our
own State. There is no country where the
opportunity for rising from lower to
higher conditions. Is more favorable to
labor.
Every exhibitor is handed a blank form,
which when properly filled expresses all
conditions having reference to the rights
of labor employed in the production of
any article. It Is a noble conception that
the product of slave labor will not be per
mitted even a place In this world's exposi
tion. That product which comes Into ex
istence in utter disregard of the rights of
man is not recognized as having any illus
trative value in the industrial world, and
this better view has attended all the ex
positions held in France. :
All honor to France. She has pal<i this
tribute to the nobility of labor. This pol
icy elevates and dignities the entire expo
sition.
If an article was presented In competi
tion with other articles of the same class
and which was itself the product of slave
labor It would not be permitted to enter
the competition because of the social or
industrial feature attending its produc
tion. This will perhaps be better under
stood by citing a specific case. Williams
& Co.'s Drop-forging Works of Brooklyn,
N. Y.. claimed the grand prize In the Iron
product on the ground of the treatment
of their employes. Their product is equally
good with other articles In competition.
They claim superiority in many thingsâ
the healthfulness of their shops, the ven
tilation of the apartments occupied by the
workmen, the care taken to prevent acci
dents to workmen by using only the most
perfect and safest machinery, the estab
lishment of fire escapes, of a perfect fire
drill, guaranteeing their workmen against
a disaster from fire, the rate of wages
paid, the conveniences and comfort of the
workmen during working hours, tho nan
ltary condition of the shops and the op
portunities for promotion among their em
ployes. These are conditions precedent to
the receipt of the grand prize.
I trust you will pardon the Intrusion of
one other matter, which possesses broader
general Interest. Awards Â«re not made
with reference wholly to the value of the
article presented. The conditions of pro
duction are considered; the rate of wages
paid; the healthfulness of the occupation;
the purchasing power of the wagesÂ«palJ
in the production of the article; the
treatment of the labor with reference to
the conservation of life and of accidents.
It may be asserted that we do not know
the Chateaux Yquem wine in America as
It is known in France, or. in other words,
the Chateaux Yquem wine In France, sold
here for domestic consumption. Is vastly
superior to the same brand consumed in
foreign countries.
I beg to emphasize the statement that a
judicious anticipation of these difficulties
would have avoided the Injurious verdict
of the exposition authorities.

ever the mind of man has conceived or

be a matter of sincere regret to our poÂ«Â»
plc that the full requirements of the ex
position were not complied with; nor was
such compliance even attempted in the
remotest degree. In material and morai
well being California moves upon a plane
as high as that which has been attained
by man anywhere in the civilized world,
and the exposition ot that fact is worth
more to a commonwealth which is invit
ing a reinforcement cf population an4
capital than the most adequate exposi
tion of Its material resources.

: WILLIAM H. MILLS.
DIRECTOR OF THE SOUTHERN* PACIFIC COMPACT'S EXHIBIT AT
THE BIG FRENCH EXPOSITION.
TO the Editor of The Call: In yÂ«ur
issue of July 1 I find a very able and
very thoughtful editorial on the sub- J
Ject of the treatment which the Call- |
fornia wine exhibit has received at the {
hands of the jury of award. You state
the facts with accuracy when you say
that California wines, bearing French^ la
bels, were denied the right of competi
tion, and you draw correct inferences as
to the deleterious effect of this decision
upon the reputation of our wines in the
commercial world. The declaration goes ,
forth as a 'sweeping denunciation of the j
entire California wlnÂ« product. It is the j
equivalent of declaring that California j
does not make wine, but that it is en- |
gaged in the practice of counterfeiting the >
wines made by other countries: that the j
Wine of California Is not a natural prod-}
uct of â¢ its soils anil its climates; that)
these soils and climates arc not adapted !
to viticulture: ht nee the vineyardists are j
simply counterfeiting the products of oth- j
er countries, falsifying the types of wines I
in France and feloniously labeling this ;
counterfeit production with well establish- j
ed brands in order to give these-Imita
tions acceptance at the hands of the com
mercial world.
While your Inferences are accurately
drawn, your conclusions justifiable, your
condemnation; of the juries of award Is
somewhat more severe than the facts of
the case warrant.'
The juries had before them the wines
of various classifications. For Illustra
' tlon, the Burgundy wine of California
was placed beside â¢ the Burgundy wines
of France. A member of the Jury who is
a. resident of the Burgundy district,
France, said that the Burgundies from
California were good wines, palatable
and sound. He himself liked them and
used them, but they were not the true
Burgundy type. If they had been pre
sented as California wines, if .the labels
had been a declaration of the facts with
out the possibility of deception, if the ap
pearance of counterfeit and imitation had
been absent, the wines would have been
considered on their merit. They were not
presented as California wines, but as
Burgundy wines.
This objection applies, to all the wines
from California bearing French labels
and placed on. exhibition under French
names. It Is true these labels declared
them to be a California product, but at
the same time it declared them to be Bur
gundy wine, not "California wine, Bur
gundy type."
Suppose fruit, the varieties of which
had originated in California, was placed
on exhibition at the Pan-American Ex
position next year at Buffalo. Suppose,
further, that this fruit, bearing a Califor
nia name. San Jose. Vacaville. Los An
geles or Riverside, declaring itself to be
San Jose fruit. Vacavilto fruit or River
side fruit, and further declaring Itself to
be, from the same specific orchard, from
these places, which, in fact, had been
grown in New Jersey. South America or
Canada, and of inferior quality to the
fruit of California. Would the people of
California endure with patience this coun
terfeit presentation? In the markets of
the world the genuine California fruit and
its Imitation would stand together. The
consumer would confound these names,
oblivious of the fact that the name of
the inferior fruit had been adopted mere
ly because the fruit resembled in type
that raised in California. It is obvious
that these fruits would stand related to
rach other before a Jury of award as a
genuine and a counterfeit. One would be
real and the other an Imitation. The
California variety would bo the original
brand, seeking to establish itself through
out the world upon its merit. The other
would be the same brand covering infe
rior goods and injurious to the reputation
of -the brand itself.
If oranges were exposed for sale in New
York. Rome. Cuba or Florida, upon the
package containing which was Inscribed
"Riverside Navels," that would be a
highly different inscription from the dec
laration that these oranges resembled
Riverside .navels, or belonged to that type.
In the first Instance, if they were Inferior,
they woud injure the brand. In the sec
ond instance, ihe inscription would pay
tribute to the superiority of the brand
Imitated.
The member of the jury of award from
the Burgundy district, already quoted, de
clared that if the labels upon the wines
had been removed and In the absence of
names numbers had been used, as for In
stance, "California wine. Burgundy type,
'No. 12," the .wine would have been pej
mltted to compete upon Its merit.
As It Is, a Jury of award In a tourna
ment as broad as the productive capac
ity of the world, has practically
decided that the wines of California are
not wines, but are merely attempted imi
tations, consciously and purposely coun
terfeiting the brands of France, Germany
and Switzerland.
This should have been foreseen by the
honorable commissioners from California
and guarded against. It was competent
at all times to have obtained a fair con
sideration of the merit of the California
product, to have received such awards as
the merits of our wines would have Justi
fied, and have attached these awards to
the particular brand of wine receiving
them. The French authorities have been
more than fair; even hospitably accom
odating.' No difficulty whatever would
have been encountered In so adjusting this
matter that the wines of California, as
California wine, would have been consid
ered by Juries of award upon their merits.
Hundreds of wine experts have tasted the
California wines brought here and have
pronounced them of excellent quality.
Many of these have declhred to me that
there is a vast market for these wines in
Europe and throughout the world: but
they have uniformly objected to having
these, wines go into the channels of com
merce under names which would confound
them with the original brands of wine. If
their quality had been decidedly superior
.to that of the same brands of wine origi
nating here in France, in Germany, or in
Switzerland, the absence of all objection
would have been easily apprehended; but
every one who has visited France can
testify that the exported article, -of wines
and beers at least. Is inferior to the do
mestic article. Wines made in France for
export purposes are uniformly fortified. It
is scarcely necessary to say to any one
skilled in the production or in the care of
wines that when they are exported they
pass under conditions of variableness of
temperature, conditions of cellarage, of
movement, of agitation, which are liable
to deteriorate their quality.

It is hardly necessary to point out to the people
of San Francisco how essential to the welfare of all
it is to have on, the bench men who have not only
a comprehensive knowledge of law, but that impar
tiality of temperament and that firmness of character
which are necessary to enable a Judge to withstand
the bias of partisanship or the pressure of outside in
fluences in giving decisions in whatever cases come
before them. Under^our system of government the
courts are more important than under that of any
other country', for they are called upon not merely to
enforce the law but to pass upon the validity of acts
of the Legislature, and thus determine the nature of
the law they enforce; Consequently we have a greater
f~* OOD Judges are not so plentiful as blackber
( *"~T ries in any community, and accordingly when
â after the test of long service on the bench a
man has been found worthy of the judicial office, ah
intelligent self-interest on the part of the community
will prompt the public to retain him in office rather
than to dismiss him for the sake of a new aspirant, no
matter hotv pleasing such aspirant may be. In the
interests of the community, therefore, .the Republi
cans should renominate Judges Belcher and Bahrs for
re-election. Their terms Â«f office, are about to ex
pire. The Republican party placed them on the bench
and it alone can retain them there. The responsibility
of re-electing them rests therefore primarily upon
Republicans, and should not be shirked upon any ex
cuse whatever.
FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD.
In all probability the Czar is massing his armies and
getting ready to play a lone hand in China solely with
the intent 'of summoning, a' peace conference at
Peking.;
The rece"nt quarrel between two police officers, at
one of'the localstatiohs had at least one merit. The
belligerent guardians of the peace. vented their.: desire
for. gore upon one another and not upon an inoffen

The row between the Board of Education and Su
perintendent, of Schools Webster has at least one
merit. It cannot make greater the demoralization
\vhich the absurd policy of the board has already
worked in the schools.
The local Health Eoard is to be congratulated at
least upon its unexampled impudence. After the pub
lic had registered a final verdict of conviction and con
demnation the board files with Â¦the Supervisors a plea
of not guilty of the plague outra'ge..
One significant fact seems to prove that the accu
sation is false that the people of Salinas have re
sorted to the firebrand in their Chinese quarter to
avenge Boxer outrages. There is nothing to indi
cate that the people of Salinas have gone insane.
This triumvirate has set in circulation the absurd
report that the proprietor of this paper and E. S.
Piilsbury are scheming to overthrow the State Cen
tial Committee. The report is a falsehood uttered to
deceive the State Committee into the granting of
concessions to the Southern Pacific Company and
Dan Burns, and it is to be hoped for the welfare of
the Republican party that the fraud will not be re
warded, with success. It is natural that William F.
Herrin should play fast and loose with the name of
E. S. Pillsburv. Prestige and ability in an adver
- -'"Â¦ Â¦ . * . * "i Â¦< Â¦âÂ¦â¢Â¦â¢Â¦*
sary are qualities William F. Herrin has reason to
fear, and it is said thit E. S. Pillsbury possesses both.
With his affairs this paper or its proprietor is not
concerned. The proprietor of The Call has com
bined with no one to interfere with the labors of the
State Central Committee nor to interrupt its exist
ence. He wishes it only the highest measure oi suc
cess in everything which will give an honorable ad
vantage and success to the Republican party.
THE Republican State Central Committee will
meet to-day to perform a duty which is of pri
mary importance to. the Republican party. Af
fairs which intimately concern the welfare of the
party must be discusstM. and the committee, in its ,
judgment, must reach a decision which shall merit the
approbation of Republicans. In this meeting The Call
i:- vitally interested to see that the decision of the
State Central Committee shall not be dictated by
disreputable agencies within the party, that political
outcasts shall not be "brought again within party
hr.eÂ«. and that mercenary rascals, masking behind-Re
publican banners, shall not be allowed once more to
prey upon party interests.
This paper iÂ« concerned solely in seeking and win
ning Republican success, and any honorable endeavor
which may contribute to that success will receive the
undivided and untiring support of this paper. The
Republican State Central Committee is given assur
ance, therefore, that any measure of its adoption
which means good to the Republican party of this
State will receive the unqualified indorsement of The
Call.
On the eve of this meeting of the Republican State
Central Committee an effort is being made to hood
wink the committee into the adoption of measures
which will mean party suicide. William F. Herrin,
through his factotum. Bogus Telegram Lynch, is cir
culating a report that the proprietor of this paper
and E. S. Pillsbury have planned to supplant the
State Central Committee at the Santa Cruz conven
tion Â«nd if possible secure the election of another.
This report is discussed simply to emphasize its ab
surdity and to disclose the purpose of those who have
circulated it.
In this matter the personality of the men concerned
:Â» not of public interest. At this* time it is no con
cern of the public thai William F. Herrin is in Re
publican politics simply that he may control agencies
which prostitute Legislatures, corrupt Supervisors and
make easy the crookÂ«Â£d road traveled by the corpora
tion for which he works. It is imperative for the Re
pobtiran State Central Committee to remember, how
ever, that he is the associate of a tenderloin bar
keeper and the representative of disease in public life.
It is not necessary for the public to know that the
favorite occupation of John C. Lynch, Collector of
Internal Revenue, is dangling a bar towel in a Mar
ket street saloon and that his field of operations is
cr.e of the back rooms of that saloon; but it is well
to remember that he is paid a salary by the Federal
Government to act the lackev for an emplove of the
Southern Pacific Company and for Dan "Burns, the
personification of all tliat should not be in political
ft STAB f!T THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
Once more we appeal to the Grand Jury to take up
this matter. Neither the Board of Health nor the
Chief of Police shows any intention or even an incli
nation to act. It is therefore imperative that the
Grand Jury should take action. The people are not
going to be deceived by a raid against fantan men.
They are going to ask this question: If the toleration
of fantan justifies a suspicion that the members of
the' Chinatown squa-d have taken bribes, what is to
be the deduction from the fact that the Board of
Health and the Chief of Police tolerate the violation
of law on the part of the rich men who oWn China
town property? â¢
It is the duty of the Board of Health and. of the
Chief of Police to enforce the health ordinances of
the city. Why have they neglected that duty? WlW
if/so much zeal displayed against a pack of petty fan
tan rascals while nothing is done JVgainst the property
owners whose violations of the law are gross, flagrant
and menacing to the whole community? What is the
good of changing the Chinatown squad, when it is
Chinatown itself that should be changed?
Clean Chinatown. Clean it up, clean it out, clean
it thoroughly. That is the moral of the situation to
day, as it has been that of the situation for years pas*.
Why make a great disturbance about a petty fantan
game here, a lottery swindle there, or any other bit of
tinhorn gambling, when the whole district needs puri
fication? What will be the good of discrediting a
policeman or two and sending a few Chinese gam
blers to jail to be maintained at the expense of the
taxpayers? No such straining out' of; gnats will do
any good to a community that is prepared to swallow
the whole camel of Chinatown. It would be like ap
plying a salve to an irritation of the skin in order
tc cure a disease of the blood.
'The evil that is now made the occasion of a com
plaint against the police, like that which gave rise
to the. quarantine, is the result of tolerating in China
town a persistent and well-nigh universal violation of
the laws of the municipality. Compel the owners cf
Chinatown property to obey the sanitary regulations
of the city, require them to clean their premises and
keep them clean, forbid them to permit on their
property any of those foul apartments, secret pas- 1
sages and underground tunnels, that not only encour
age vice but afford :o the vicious a means of escap
ing detection and evading pursuit, and a long step
will have been taken toward the suppression of the
offenses of which there are now so many and such
just complaints.
Out of the reappearance of the scandal there can
not come a sensation, but the people can, if they
choose draw from it a moral containing an important
lesson. The Chinatown scandals are not due to any
fault of the police squads that patrol the district. They
are the inevitable result of the conditions that prevail'
in Chinatown, and those conditions are due to tlic
fact that the officials of the city permit the property
owners of the district to maintain their premises in a
manner that renders them breeding-houses of vice
and crime and disease.
Why try to make a sensation out of the reappear
ance of the old scandal? It has become "a twice told
tale vexing the dull ears of drowsy men." Every po
lice sergeant who accepts the Chinatown detail might
as well bid a long farewelljto his reputation.' Whether
he do good or do evil he will have enemies, and they
will start the old story of blackmail and corruption.
He that handles "pitch will be defiled, and he that
serves in Chinatown cannot escape the Chinatown
stink. Wherefore praise is to be given to' the two
members of Mahoney's squad who some time ago
asked to be relieved from' further service in the dis
trict. They are wise men in their generation, and
are. now enjoying the benefits of their discretion by
being able to stand at a safe distance from the fire
while watching their companions on the grill.
ONCE more the old story from Chinatown.
The charges against Police Sergeant Mahoney
and his squad and the sergeant's indignant de
nial of them are but repetitions of talcs with which
the people of San Francisco have been familiar for
years. Policemen come and policemen go in China
town, but the familiar stqry runs on from year to
year with hardly a change except that of the names.

The terms of five Superior Judges expire in Janu
ary, iooi. To their positions Judges are to be elected
this year. Each party will of course nominate can
didates for them all. To that extent the issue is
a partisan one, but no further. Intelligent voters
will not permit party considerations to affect their
action in voting for Judges. All that a party can
do with respect to such offices is to nominate candi
dates. It lies in the power of Republicans to refuse
a renomination to Judge Bahrs and Judge Belcher,
but such a refusal will cost the party dear. These men
on the bench have borne themselves worthily; they
have won the confidence*an3 the esteem of men of all
parties, and it is not too much to say that the better
class of citizens of all parties expect their renomina
tion. This is one of the duties the party owes to the
city that must not be overlooked. â¢
concern in selecting good Judges than any other peo
ple. Moreover, all experience 'proves that it is'npt
easy to obtain fit men for such offices. Over and
over again litigants- â and, indeed, whole communi
ties â have suffered by reason of a Judge incompetent
or lacking in integrity. Out of that experience can
be learned the , lesson which the Republicans of San
Francisco are now called upon to -apply to the case
before them. ! . v '
We have in the midst of us about seven millions
and a half of illiterate negroes, our former slaves and
their descendants, and as many more illiterate whites
of our own race. These are the lees in the wine of our
civilization, and there be philosophers, who ocay that
we have no need to capture islanders seven thousand
miles away to educate at our expense while there is
such a goodly number of our own people who don't
know B from bullsfoot.
When it comes to a competition of civilizations the
red ribbon is worth oil sorts of expense, and if it be
so very important that we get the rerdict of the Fili
pinos in our favor we should spare neither pains nor
expense, for there is a growing suspicion that our
civilization needs indorsement.
The Professor-Commissioner will see at once that
when the study of the two civilizations is reduced to
equality of terms we must not only educate "a goodly
number" at Berkeley, but to prove that we are su
perior to Spain must send them to the peninsula and
duplicate their education in Spanish universities.
Professor Moses, being a philosopher, and having
prepared to placate the islands by taking the census,
must see that a Filipino who is prepared to deplete
the revenues of Berkeley by matriculating as a stu
dent of our civilization is likely to be intelligent
enough to understand that Spain and America are not
tc be judged and compared by what Spain did in the
islands and what we do at home. The terms of com
parison must be equal. Our deeds in the islands must
be compared with Spain's, and the home life of Spain
with ours.
The Filipinos have had exactly the same opportun
ity to judge our civilization that they had to judgs
Spain's, in its effect upon the people born and reared
under it for generations. No study' of it in the
Berkeley university can remove or improve the im
pression of it they have received from contact with us
in their own islands.
It is a crude and homely but not unwise saying
among plain people, arising in a past age of license
in personnl conduct and habit, that a gentleman is a
man who is a gentleman when he is drunk.
Civilizations may be judged in much the same way.
Do they control their subjects when removed from
their immediate atmosphere, or do they lapse to a
lower plane? That is the issue, and not what con
duct is followed when in their atmosphere.
We regret that Professor Moses falls into cant.
There has been too much cant about our superior
civilization. Not as an official, but as a professor
and philosopher, Professor Moses knows that civili
zations are judged by their effect upon the people
reared under them. The intellectual, moral and so
cial institutions of a country are its character, what
Buddha called its "Karma."
Professor Moses is a philosopher and student. He
lias arranged to take a census in the islands, and his
colleague in the faculty, Professor Plehn, is going
out to take it. Just what relation there is between
taking the census of an infuriated and disappointed
people and sending some of them to school at the
cost of American taxpayers, and the placation of the
island?, is not visible to us. â¢
7 From observations already made I am inclined to
think that we shall find among the young people of
the islands a large number of eager and competent
students, and I hope some arrangement may be made
by which, from time to time, a goodly number may
be sent to the schools of America. It may, perhaps,
be found advisable to render some of them assistance
from public funds. It is quite likely that in this way
we can help to bring the people of these islands to
appreciate somewhat the civilization of the United
States, and to mark the difference between America
and Spain."
The latest information of the doings of the com
mission comes to the public by the way of Berkeley,
Cal. President Benjamin Ide Wheeler of the State
University enlarges a letter from Professor Bernard
Moses of that institution, who is a member of the
commission. Professor Moses says:
WHEN will the Commissioners to the Philippines
get down to l he business on which they, arc
sent, get down cut of the air, on to the ground,
and do something to end there a military situation
which is getting more rank every day with a greater
odium than made Spain offensive? The reports mul
tiply that from officers down to privates, the soldier3
arc the lords of life and death. The massacres that
take place are sickening. The only law seems to be
the code of Attila, the Hun, lex talionis. In re
taliation the innocent are mowed down and towns are
razed to the ground. It was to end all this that the
last commission went out. But little, and that unim
portant, has been heard of its doings. It has discov
ered the ecclesiastical land tenure, but makes no
proposition concerning it. â¢ The Spanish friar issue
has been presented to it, but no solution is proposed.
Exclusion of the Chinese has been asked for by the
natives, but no aclion is taken. Now be it known
that the practical, burning questions in the islands
arc three in 'number. They are: Land tenure, the
friars, the Chinese. These were principally the cause
of the revolution against Spain in 1806, which e'nded
with the treaty of Biacbatano. Spain promised to
settle these issues in the interest of the native people
and broke her word.
When the commission takes up these questions the
end of the long misery may be in sight.
But is it taking them up? If so, the most remark
! able reticence is shown by it. It procured the ar
ranpement of a fete in Manila to celebrate the am
nesty proclamation, and nobody attended.

In speaking cf the Mahoney scandal
yesterday Chief of Police Sullivan said
that hfs duty In the premises had prac
tically ended. "I do not intend," he said,
"to prefer any charges N against Sergeant
Mahoney. because I have no evidence, that
he has been guilty of any wrongdoing. It
makes no difference what Fuspicions I
might have, the (act remains that I have
no proof and I will not assail the char
acter of a member of the department
without proof. Money may have passed
in this matter as far as I know. There
seems to be evidence that the Chinese
gamblers contributed to a corruption
fund and that some of that money may
have drifted Into channels which it
phould never have reached. But of this
"In order that there may be no more
complications in this matter I have issued
written instructions to the new squad.
The patrolmen are to make their rounds
In pairs and are ordered to make arrests
wherever they see violations of the law.
This will simplify affairs materially and
will silence one of the most significant
objections made to the policy of Ser
geant Mahoney."
Sergeant McManus has already made
three arrests since his advent in the dis
trict. He raided the lottery den of liig
Chung at 70S Sacramento street and took
one man Into custody. Search warrants
will be asked for permission to examine
sctiros of places in the district, and when
the now squad has found its bearings the

lar corruptly during his service in the Chi- s

of circumstances was compelled- ln a
measure to neglect the gambling clubs. He
says that he never prevented any of his

however, was pledged to send a team up
to Lake County during the season and

only time at which this could be done.
PACIFIC AND ALAMEDA
CRICKET TEAMS TO MEET
The evidence which Chief of Police Sul
fcven poppesses 1b based almost excluslve-
Zy upon Chinese testimony, which, in an
affair of this character. Is practically
worthless. It is known that Mahoney did
not close the ecores of gambling and lot
tery houses which are running ln full
blast in the Chinese quarter. These dens
were known to even casual visitors in the
Chinese quarter, and they certainly could
not have been unknown to Sergeant Ma
honey unless he is willing to admit that
he was criminally negligent of his duty.
it is charged that Mahoney reprimanded
iis subordinates for any attempt to raid
a lottery den or gambling house without
bis permission. It is a matter easy to
prove that the Chinese gamblers made a
meekly subscription to a corruption fund
and that they were loud in protesting
against the tribute which they were
*ore*>d to pay.
Whether that money or any part
of it parsed into the hands of the police
is the question which Chief Sullivan is
rot prepared to answer, and to determine
which he says he has not the- positive
firoof. whatever his suspicion may be.
His investigation proved to h!s satisfac
tion that Sergeant Mahoney, In the face
of ugly rumors, was not performing his
duties. The law was being violated and
for that reason Sergeant Mahoney was
lemoved. That the Chinese understood
the situation thoroughly was demon-
Etrated last night when Sergeant Bernard
McManus and his squad took charge of
the district. Every gambling house was
closed to its horde of patrons. The hun
dreds of white boys and men who have
been patronizing the lotteries did not
make their nightly visit. The change in
police government had made a moft Fig-
Ma honey Was Blind to Duty.

Proof of Guilt Must

Â«
THE removal of SergÂ«*ant Patrick
Mahoney and his squad from China
town was the theme yesterday of
sensational gossip In police circles.
The crash which came so suddenly was
not by any rn^ns unexpected, as the
tongue of scandal has wagged for months
ln reference to police administration ln
the Chinese district. It was a matter of
common notoriety that gambling was
going on not only without police inter
ferencÂ« but practically under police pro
tection. It was known that the Chinese
were subscribing to a corruption fund
and that they were squirming under the
demands which were made upon them. It
â¢was natural, therefore, that the climax
should be reached in a scandal.
Chief of Police Sullivan does not intend,
however, to prefer charges against Ser
geant Mahoney for any member of his
equad. The Chief declares that it would
be Idle for him to do so, as he has no
positive proof of the guilt of the officer
whom he has removed, and he will not in
stitute an Investigation based upon noth
ing more substantial than suspicion. The
Chief of Police Intends to present all the
facts ln his possession to the Police Com
jr.lssion and leave It to that body to de
termine whether or not an inquiry Into
the conduct of Sergeant Mahoney shall be
cade. It is ln this way that the matter
now rests. Sergeant Mahoney has made
a complete statement to the Chief of Po
lice and has denied every charge made
against him. even by Insinuation. The
e^rgeant as a matter of course Insists
U.at he has been guiltless of any wrong,

pome action he will perform the duties

Say the Guarding Inspectors Receive
Sufficient per Diem and It
Should Not Be Ia
' creased.
.*â¢ Â»
The retaining of George Knight to use
his personal political influence at "Wash
ington to have the per Oiem of guarding
inspectors increased, a3 detailed exclu
sively in yesterday's issue of the Call, was
the prominent topic of conversation ln
Custom-house circles during the day.
Outside of the seventy-four guarding in
spectors immediately interested in his
mission, no one at all conversant with the
facts believed that Mr. Knight would suc
ceed.
Port Collector Jacksoo eaid that in all
probability the Secretary of tha Treasury
would refer the matter to him for his
opinion and report and thnt' hp would not
hesitate to report unfavorably; Discharg
ing inspectors were paid $4 per .day. he
said, because work of a clerical nature
was required, and their duties were of. a
very responsible and tldiciary character.
Three dollars per diem for the night In
spectors, who simply acted as watchmen,
he considered a fair compensation, being
on* dollar more than was received by pri
vate watchmen on the water front. The
Collector said further that if the per diem
of the night or guarding Inspectors should
be raised in this port there would be a
demand for a similar increase in every
port In the United States.
Customs Surveyor Spear expressed hlm
sHf as opposed to the proposition for sim
ilar reasons.
"I have no objection to Mr. Knight
earning. $C000 or $4000." he said.- " and I
am glad that he received $350 from the
guarding inspectors to buy cigars with in
Washington, for he is a good fellow and
well worth the money If he can earn it.
But; I don # t think he will. Of course
among the guarding inspectors there are
some men equally competent to act as
discharging inspectors, but these are pro
moted whenever an opportunity offers. In
the meantime they are not called upon to
do any clerical or responsible work."

There are more denials of the fact that

The charges of mismanagement are
grave ones, but Hewitt declares he can

the opinion of at least one of the Commis

Town Talk, the brightest of the week
lies, has an exceptionally entertaining
number this week. In addition to Its us
ual supply of exclusive club, social and
political gossip and crisp comment, the
paper presents this week the autobiog
raphy of the distinguished literary ge
nius, Charles Warren Stoddard. written
for Town Talk. The Saunterer tells an in
teresting story about a "Dutch treat,"
given by a society belle in San Rafael.*
and also exposes the gross negligence of
the university -regents In several para
graphs relating to their failure to secure
the Sutro library for the public
Town Talk Is Sprightly.
Tn addition to the facts contained in
the above others of interest are set forth
In the report. It Is . stated that during
the year 3517 marriage licenses were Is
sued, 1528 aliens were naturalized and U83
aliens declared their Intention to become
citizens. One hundred and thirty, certifi
cates to practice medicine were issued and
fifty-one dentists were- vested with au
thority to practice their profession. The
document itself is a work of art from the
title page to the conclusion, being appro
priately illustrated by the -penman who
completed the work.
Several Interesting facts regarding the
conduct of the office of. the County Clerk
are contained in the following report filed
by County Clerk Deane with Mayor Phe
lan on Thursday. That most interesting
to the taxpayers Is the fact that during
the fiscal year Just completed a saving of ;
$39,864 C5 over the preceding year was ef
fected:
SAN* FRANCISCO. July 31, 1900.
To the Honorable J. D. Phelan. Mayor of the
City and County of San Franciscoâ Dear Sir:
In accordance with section 9 of article XVI of
the charter, and in cumpliance with Resolution
No. 470 of the Board of Supervisors, dated June
11, 1900, I respectfully submit my annual re
port for the fiscal year ending June 80, R00, as
follows, to wit: . â¢
In presenting this report it is with pleasure
that I call the attention of your Honor to the
great decrease in the expenditures of this office
lor the fiscal year, which said decrease
amounts to the sum of $43,404 30. This (treat
paving has been effected by carefully watching
the stationery and supplies and owderlng only
so much thereof as was actually necessary, and
als-o in the amount allowed and paid for sal
aries of deputies and copyists, which last Item
ehows that the sum of $76,436 74 was paid out
as agnlnst the sum of $119,541 15 for the pre
ceding fiscal year. 'While the receipts of the
office have not been as great as the preceding
yfar, FtiU thts is due to the fact that all in
solvency matters in this city and county have
been transferred to the United States courts
under the bankruptcy act, and also to the fact
that this office la no longer allowed to collect
the inheritance tax.
At the present time I have but forty-nine men
employed in the office, as' arainst sixty last
year. 6tlll the work is almost up to date and of
a high decree of excellence, which speaks much
for the competency and efficiency of the depu
ties clerks and copyists. Although the re
ceipts of the office for the fiscal year Just end
ed only amounted to the sum of J68.10S 75, as
against the Bum of $74,248 40 for the preceding
year, still as the disbursements of the office for
this year only amounted to the sum of SS4.933 79.
as against the sum of $130,340 09 for the preced
ing year a net saving has been made to the
taxpayers of this city and county of $39,S64 65
for the year,
In conclusion I would state that the County
Clerk's office should be made self-sustaining
and could be easily made so by a. Judicious re
vision of the fee bill by the next Legislature,'
and to this end I wlll.be only" too pleased to
devote my best efforts. Respectfully.
WILLIAM A. DEANE, County Clerk.

Mrs. A. W. Flint to Resign. /â¢
Mrs. A. W. Flint made known her Inten
tion to resign as register of the Central
Council of the Associated Charities at
yesterday's session of that body. The an

has been the executive head of the Cen
tral Council six years and has been ac
tively connected in an official capacity
with the administration of the Associated
Charities from the date of organization,
ten vears ago. The reason assigned was
poor health. A committee was appointed
to draft suitable resolutions.

"I have been practicing law in this
city," said Moser later, "for the past
fourteen years. My wife died about eigh
teen months ago and I have not practiced
much since. 1 resided In Alma, Buffalo
County, Wis.. and after my two years'
term in the Legislature I practiced law
there till 1 came to this city."
ONCE A JUDGE, NOW THE JTJDGEI
the following note from his landlady, Mrs.
Ruedy, 110 Ninth street: "Your room rent
must be paid by 6 o'clock this p. m. If
not the doors will be locked against you
forever, as there will be a man here at
7 o'clock to take the room If you can't
pay. This Is final."
Moser could not pay. so he decided to
walk the streets all night. He had about
nine glasses- of beer and about 5 o clock
in the morning he thought he would call
upon Wilson and see If he could help him.
He tried the door of 067 and as it was
unlocked he walked upstairs and looked
for a bell rope to ring for the landladv
to get Wilson's room. There was no bell
rope and he was walking along the hall
way to the rear when a man came out of
a bedroom and grabbed him by the
wrists, accusing him of being a burglar.
Then a policeman came and he was ar
rested.
The Judge thought the charge of at
tempt at burglary should be dismissed,
I but suggested that a coinplaint should
be. sworn to charging Moser with disturb
ing the peace. This was done and the
Judge, after hearing the evidence, con
tinued the case till August 17, when Moser
will bring forward witnesses as to his
character. He was allowed to go on pro
bation till that time.
/sgONRAD MOSER, an attorney with
[( headquarters in ex-Judge Colton's
\^J> office In the Parwatt building, ap-
peared in Judge Mogan's court yes
terday morning to answer to a charge of
attempted burglary. He was arrested
shortly after 5 a. m. at the residence of
A. Bernard. 96TB Howard street, by Po
liceman Mitchell. Interest was added to
the proceedings when Moser testified that
he was for four years Judge of the Cir
cuit Court for the Eighth District of Wis
consin, from 1S63 to 1S69; that he was af
terward Judge of the Probate Court and
later member of the Wisconsin legisla
ture.
Bernard's testimony was that he was
awakened from his sleep by the noise
made by pome one walking in the hallway
oulside his bedroom door. He jumped
out of bed and discovered the defendant.
He grabbed hold of him and yelled for
his son to come to his assistance. He
then sent his son for an officer and Po
liceman Mitchell appeared. The son, A.
Bernard Jr., corroborated his father and
said he was the last one of the family
to enter the house Thursday night â and (
that he locked the front door.
Moser testified that a few days ago
he met a Mr. Wilson, who was interest
ed In oil lands, at the Palace Hotel. Wil
son pave him his address, which was
either ?65. W7 or 9â¬9 Howard street, and
asked him to call and pee him, telling
him at the same time that he was an ear

Market-Street Company Did Not For
feit Its Franchise, as Notice of
Beconstruction Was Given
in Time.
.
The Supervi5ors' Street Committee de
cided yesterday to recommend the re
scinding of the resolution recently passed
by the board directing the Market-street
Hallway Company not to begin work on
the Firrt-rtreet electric road. The com
jiany had served notice that it would
Ftart operations to-day, but the commit
tee insisted on being furnished with pr^of
that the franchise of the North Beach
and Mission road had not been abandon
ed owing to failure to operate cars for
six month? past.
City Engineer Crunsky demonstrated to
the satisfaction of the committee that the
corporation did in pood faith proceed to
use its franchise on First street within
Fix months after the new charter became
effective by submitting plans to the Board
of Public Wortcs on or about May 23 last
and had also distributed material along
First street for the reconstruction of its
tracks, thereon.

Mr. Grunsky said the compar.y had sub

desirable be depipnoted. The matter was
discussed in the Mayors office and it was
agreed that the road should cross Bush
street to First to clear the Donahue
fountain. IJurke shid the delay was
onusc-d by the riipoussion as to the best
location of the tracks. Supervisor Dwyer
thought that after the statement of Kn
pineer Orunsky the company should be
permitted to go ahead with the work un

lic Works and it was Â»o ordered. The
character of the pavement on the street
will also be specified by the board.

Auditor Wells has devised a new plan
whereby the teachers and janitors will be
protected in the matter of receiving their
salaries. He has determined to set aside
the sum of $975,514 out of the total appro
priation of $1,100,000. for schools for teach
ers' salaries during the present fiscal
year. This sum Is based on the amount
expended during the last year for paying
teachers, as provided by the act of the
last Legislature. He finds that the char
ter provision appropriating $28 per pupil
Is Insufficient, and he will fall back on the
teachers' act of 1S98. The balance of $1S4,
486 he will divide into twelve parts, and
out of this the board will pay the janitors
salaries, supplies, rents and other ex
penses. This course is prompted by the
fact that the July! demands for janitors*
salaries exceeded one-twelfth of the $50,
000 set aside by the Supervisors. The
Auditor holds that the Supervisors have
no authority to segregate the school fund.
If they did some of the janitors would
not receive their July salaries until next
month. The Auditor's plans will. secure
the payment of all salaries, and after
Chairman Mark has certified that all the
teachers have been paid out of the money
set aside for them the janitors' demands
will be paid.

The teaching" of cooking. will not come so
high, the necessary ranges, stoves, etc.,

Following are the amounts expended

SCHOOL BOARD
NEGLECTED TO
INVITE BIDS
The Board of Education practically, de
cided yesterday to accept the enrollment
order issued by Superintendent of Schools
Webster, In which he fixes the maximum
limit of attendance in classes at forty
flve pupils. The board had issued a
schedule limiting the; enrollment to
fifty-five, but at a meeting of principals
held in the assembly room yesterday
action on the order on classification was
postponed for two weeks. Chairman
Mark disclaims that the board has
backed down, but admits that Superin
tendent Webster's ideas on the subject
are entirely proper. Chairman Mark said
that at the end of two weeks, after re
ports have been filed by the principals,
Superintendent Webster will be called into
consultation and a compromise rule on
enrollment will be adopted.
As Superintendent Webster expresses
his intention to stand by his* order, it is
almost certain that the board will sub
mit gracefully and the controversy will
be amicably settled. Director Denman
is the only one who still claims that Su
perintendent Webster has no authority
In the premises, but he may relent at the
last moment. The effect of Superintend
ent Webster's enrollment proposition will
be to provide places for pome twenty
teachers who have been consolidated out.
and there 1 is general rejoicing % among
teachers eligible for the positions.
The Board of Education decided to give
the principals an opportunity to suggest
a plan of classification of pupils in their
respective schools.' At the meeting yes
terday afternoon they were requested
to send In a report to the board within
two weeks outlining the best classification
possible.
"If you find that you can make a. con
solidation, do so at once," said Presi
dent Mark; "but if you cannot, explain
the reasons why In your report and the
board will try to help you. The board
and Superintendent Webster will certain
ly reach an amicable understanding, and
the original schedule will be readjusted
to suit all concerned. Naturally many
features of this readjustment will depend
upon the reports ol the principals.
The meeting was largely attended. Sev
eral took advantage of the open discus
sion, but they said nothing that indicated
ill feeling toward ) the new scheme.
President Mark presided, and after a few
introductory words Director Mary \V\
KIncaid took up the classification ques
tion. She favored large classes, both from
an educational and economic standpoint.
The interruption caused- by putting in
new pupils after the schoolwork has be
gun is oftentimes disastrous, not only to
the old scholars but to the incoming ones
as well. The enrollment in a schoolroom
Is always larger at the beginning of a
term than at the end. As an illustration
the Director stated that in the Franklin
School there were C42 pupils enrolled at
the beginning of the year in 1S91>. while
ill June of 1900 the attendance had dwin
dled to G21. In view of these conditions
she considered it well to have as large
an enrollment as possible to begin with
and have as few changes as possible dur
ing the year, thereby obviating constant
unrest on the part of the scholars.
Director James Denman explained that
the board had devised the .classification
scheme largely for the sake of economy.
"We have been allowed JS1.000 less to run
the School Department this year than
was given us last year. We realize that
many of the outside school buildings are',
a disgrace to the city. They need re
pairs and .other improvements. We are
going to try to make these Improve
ments, as far as the limited funds at our
disposal will allow. If repairs are not
made it will be because we haven't >Â¦ the
means. In regard to the classification
scheme, I will say that the Board of Edu
cation has but one interest at heart, and
that is to promote the best interests of
the schools with the money at its com
mand. I was surprised recently when I
learned that- one of our prominent coal
dealers had not sent in his bid for sup
plying the department with coal. I asked
him why he had neglected to offer a bid,
and he replied that he already had bills
against the city aggregating a large
amount, and he wanted to collect some of
it before he did any more trusting.
"The School Department .intends to pay
Its bills and to that end we intend to
economize. Consolidation is absolutely
necessary, and in this move we desire the
co-operation of the teachers. We are try
ing to arrange the department so you will
not lose two or three months' salary at
the end of the year. Our â¢ current ex
penses are over $90,000 a month. The ap
.propriatlon allows us $96,000 for every
thing, including repairs, so you see $6000
a month over and above current expenses
will not go very far." -
The Director then referred to those
teachers who want select classes. He did
not believe In selected classes, maintain
ing that better results could be obtained
by a mixture of. the brilliant and the less
brilliant. The practice of some of the
principals In shortening the noon hour on
rainy days and letting the pupils out a
half hour or an hour earlier In the after
noon was declared undesirable by the
Director, and he advised that the rule
for a regular one-hour recess at noon be
strictly complied with. .
It was announced that there would be
a meeting of the teachers of the seventh
and eighth grades at the Mission Hrgn
School next Monday afternoon to meet
Superintendent C. E. Works relative to
the new manual training sytem that is
to be inaugurated. The city is to be di
vided Into seven districts and every pupil
in the seventh and eighth grades wlll_be
required to take the manual course. Mr.
Works comes from tjie Teachers College
in New York and he Is to have five assist
ants. â¢ Â«

THE SUNDAY CALL J^X^ SEE THE GREAT
LEADS THEM ALL _-^^ C0MIC SECTION*ALIFORNIA is to have a very wet winter, and the pilots are ready to
Â¦ H gamble on It. They are divided, however, as to the extent of the pre
\^ cipitation. Captain Freeman thinks there will be about seventeen inches
of moisture, while Captain Frank Murphy is willing to give 2 to 1 that
the downpour will exceed twenty Inches. Captain F. Jordan Is willing 'to
compromise on sixteen inches, while Captain Alec Swanson is confident the
rainfall will be 1S.CÂ«5 inches. Alec has carefully studied the situation and
knows what he is talking about. One thing ia certain, and that is that the
pilots of the port of Ban Francisco are a unit In predicting a wet winter for
California.
The reasons for the prediction of the pilots are these: The "whale birds"
are hÂ«>re away ah^ad of time and their early advent always presages a hard
winter. For years past they have never put In an appearance until about
August 13. and sometimes as late as August 25. -Whenever they fall to ap
poar until the latter date California has always experienced an unusually
dry winter. When they come in early the reverse is the case".
Thi3 year the "whale birds" put in their appearance on July 27, and In
consequence the pilots are willing to Ptake their last cent, that a very wet
winter is to be California's portion during the next season. .;'... -5.
The "whale bird" ia always to be found in attendance upon the whales.,
The latter take thousands of small fish Into their mouths which they cannot
swallow, and as thepe make their escape thfÂ» birds pounce upon them and
make a meal. That the whales are very much in evidence has been demon
strated during 1 the past few week*. The pilot boat Bonlta was sunk by one,
another ran away with the Grade S, a thir.d nearly sank the ferry steamer
San Rafael, while still. another nearly swamped the launch Athlete, with
George Knight aboard. The "whale birds" are always in attendance, and in.
their wake comes rainâ "much rain." say the pilots. v.
It Is a safe gamble that we will have at least twenty, inches of rainfall '
this year," said Captain Frank Murphy yesterday. ; "The whale birds are:
here away ahead of time, and I never knew their early advent fail to pre
sage a heavy downpour. I have watched their coming and going for. a gen
eration and have always founa that when they came before August 10.it
was a question of getting out your sou'wester and : oilskins, but when they
were later than August 15 you, could dispense With rubber, boots for, the"
reft of the year. This time they iwer/ largely In evidence on ; July 27, so, I .

' On the other side the Lowellsâdescend
ed from Percival Lowell, who settled In
Newbury, Mass., In '1637â were p^ple of
power for generations. John LowHj wa.<i
Mr. Lowell made the Atlantic of those
early days a wonderful thing. It seemed
in some way a mirror of his own Individu
ality, as he hlraaelf was to a degree tho
mirror of the genius of the age. But he
was an editor who managed things in his
own unique way. reading a manuscript
wherever the spirit found him or he fouud
the time, and cla!)plnpr it Into some unlike
ly place of the moment: so that long af
ter he left the editorial chair people were
sending to his successor manuscripts that
they had found unaccountably on their
tables or In their desks.
But the work was .'iksome and he re
signed it to Mr. Fields after about five
years. But in those five years he hart done
more to stimulate thought and style and
to create a high standard of literary aft
among us than any other single force.
Some time later he became an associate
editor of the North American Review for
a few years.
His mother had a memory stored with
the ballads of many lands. In many
tongues, and she made poetry the atmo
sphere of his being. It Is not lmposslb>
that she brought into the family that wild
strain which feeds genius, a certain tang
added to the drink of the gods. She be

I had submitted my first story under a
pseudonvm. But I sent him. at another
time, with the fatuity of the young writer.
a story with a new pseudonym after he
knew my own name. (I sometimes won
dered if he were kinder to me becauseâ in
total ignorance that it was his mother's
name â I had chosen name of Spenee
for one of my disguises.) My sister copied
the story for me and lest our script should
have any resemblance I had her make a
difference In the <=hape of certain letters.
I received an i>arly reply, addressed not
to the pseudonym, but to me. saying that
although the "d's" were all "d's" tne
i-dees were the same.
Well, what am I driving at. then? Why. I
have sent your poem to the printer. The opin
ions or and are quite as likely to jump
with that' of the public as mine. But do not.
I beg. misunderstand me. When I write to
you about anything of yours I do not write of
ficially, but simply because I feel an Interest In
what you do with yourself. As editor, I write
no letters unless under downricht compulsion.
I have too much to do. and, moreover, letters
don't say Just what we tell them to say, r.or
just as we Bhould like to have ihem say it
But when your poem Is printed, may I de

If you like the poem that is enough.
I wonder that a woman should be so un

dare say I am a joose far taking any kind of
interest in my contributors beyond the value
of their natne3 on the cover. â¢ â¢ â¢ But Is it
with what women write, as with themselves,
that we must lik* altogether or not at all?
Did I not tell you that what I was thinking of
was you and not the Atlantic? I have a no

periments on the public â that they should al
ways look to makins their impression a cu

watering their reputation. For thÂ« flrst thin?

something betterâ namely, excellence.
Lowell, as one of our hosts, came in, and
It was like a hurst of sunshine, melting
the Ice instantly with his debonair gen
iality and sweetness. Dr. Holmes and Mr.
Whittier. Mr. Longfellow. Professor
Stowe, Mr. Whipple. Edmund Qulncy.
Frank Underwood, were, with others,
among the guests. Of all the brilliant
company present I think Colonel Higgin
son alnd I are the only survivors.
-In Jhose days Mr. Lowell was the- editor
,in chief of the Atlantic Monthly and those
of his contributors who found favor with
him had a delightful friend. He fostered
and developed such power as they had
and his suggestions were invaluable. His
letters were precious possessions: many of
them too personal for publication. Per
haps I ought not v to print the subjoined,
written. I think. In reply to one in which
I had withdrawn a poem he did not alto
gether like: ,
In tremendous contrast to such work
as this is the "Fable for Critics"' with
its inimitable drollery, published anony
mously In 1S4S. If this was suggested bv
"English Bards and Scotch Reviewers'"
It bore no likeness, being utterly novel
and original. If the writer was unsparing
in relation to fraud and imbecility, he
was equally unsparing of his own preten
sions and the praise he awarded was posi
tive and generous. Nothing lovelier In Its
way was ever written than what he says
of Hawthorne and John Dwlght and Irv
ing. But Lowell loved to praise: thera
vas no foothold or cranny for praise- to
p!nnt Itself that he did not seize.
Having remained a widower four year*,
Mr. Lowell married Miss Frances Dunlap
of Portland In 183J. taking her after a
brief residence elsewhere to the beautiful
Elm wood, where he was born; the year*
passing delightfully with study, work and
the friends of a charmed circle. He went
to Europe again in 1S73 and not long after
that period he was appointed Minister
to Spain, subsequently becoming our Min
ister to England, welcomed there by. Eng
lish journals as the Erabassador from tho
republic of American literature to tho
court cf Shakespeare and beginning pub
lic life at an eminence where others leave
off. His culture, his high breeding?, his
wit and charm, together with hl3 fine po
litical tact, gave him an immense popu
larity In Great Britain. Not without hi*
critics concerning the Irish question, ha
was. .nevertheless, a large factor in the
production of ;he cordial feeling that has
been going on between England and
America and growing since hia day. But
Itp never for an Instant forgot that he
was an Ame rican. the patriotism that was
rather flamboyant in his essay upon "A
Certain Condescension in Foreigners"
never decreasing in ardorâ the same lovÂ©
of country that made him do his best with
the grace of song and the sting of epi
gram to remove her wmnjr ana shame.
He> returned to America when a new ad
ministration came in. having lost his wife
and having begun to grow old. It is no
table that as the years advanced the more
conservative he grew, cllneins to old
Ideals and refusing to accept the new. and
possibly hi."* absence from home and con
sequent unacquaintance made ?ome of his
personal judgments of less value than
onVe. He had always had certain fixed
faiths in things spiritual, of which on*
was a strong assurance of the immortal
ity of the soul. Once he wrote of himself
In an Illness. "I lost all Konsclouaness of
my flesh.- I was dispersed through spac<Â»
in some Inconceivable fashion anil mixed
with the milky way. Yet the very fact
that I had a confused consciousness of
the milky way as something to bo mingled
with proved that I was thiÂ°n as much of
an individual as ever." Later his Ideas
of the spiritual life became more concrete,
while his soul was full of hop* and trust
and his religious experience deepened.

Judge Cabaniss Will Bender His De
cision in the Valentine Matter
This Morning.
The trial of W. D. Valentine and others
charged with conducting a "clock" or
"tape" game at 43 Ellis street was con
cluded before Judge Cabaniss yesterday
morning, and the Judge reserved his deci
sion till this morning.
Valentine was again called to the stand
for cross-examination. Regarding Attor
ney Coffey's question as to the method of
working the tape and reel, which was
taken under consideration by the Judge,
he decided that the witness should not be
called upon to answer. Coffey then ques
tioned him as to the certificate of shares
of the Excelsior Gold Mining Company,
but nothing definite was brought out, aÂ«
the Judge sustained objections made by
Attorney Collins. The same procedure
was gone through regarding the alleged
letter from "W. Seward, New York."
No further testimony was offered for
the defense, and Attorney Collins briefly
argued for a dismissal. Attorney Coffey
did not reply and the Judge said he would
render his decision this morning.

The first transport to get away will be
the Universe. She will take a full cargo
of t-upplies and fodder, and is expected to
sail on Monday next. The Universe will
be followed by the Strathgyle and Aztec
about the 12th inst., while the Warren,
with the Ninth Cavalry, will get away on
August 16. The Belgian King, with a
siege battery and pack train", will get
away in company with the Warren, while
the Fredericka (now on her way here
from China) and the Rosecrans will take
away two light batteries of artillery. The
Rosecrans will take the men and a num
ber of hospital stewards and nurses, while
the FredericKa will take the horses and
guns.
. On the transport wharf there is not the
rush of work that might be expected
owing to the sudden demand made on the
service. The Universe is the only vessel
loading, and en her there are twenty-four
men employed. Of these eleven are ex
army men. Volunteers who served in
Cuba and the Philippines and are now out
of work besiege the wharf and the offi
cers in authority daily, but the latter say
that when 200 men ask for work and only
twenty can be employed somebody is sure
to get left. Dunn says he is doing the
very best he can under the circumstances.
As soon*as the Universe is loaded the
men will be discharged and a new gang
gut on the Aztec and another on the
trathgyle, while a third will load the
Warren. Bad storage means a roar
from the authorities at Manila and Taku
and a subsequent kick from Washington,
which grows in vigor until it gets' to the
end of the line on the transport wharf.

Sergeant George Bunner of the casual

reported to the California-street Police
Station Thursday night that he had been
robbed of a large amount of money by.
Private B. McMurray of the same detach

as he expressed his intention of deserting,
It is supposed that he has done so. ,
Wednesday night Bunner and McMur
ray spent the evening in the city, and
having missed the last car, went to bed
In a lodging-house at Pacific and Kearny
streets. Before retiring McMurray said
he was going to desert, but as he was
slightly under the influence of liquor his
companion paid no attention to him. Next
morning when Bunner awoke he found
that he had been robbed of nearly $200.
which he had carried in his pockets, and
that McMurray had gone. Â¦ . i
Bunner searched for McMurray during
the day and, as he did not show up at
the Presidio, reported the matter to the

arrived at the Presidio yesterday after
noon. The delay in their arrival was due

"These guns require the most careful at
tention. So nicely are they adjusted that
one man can handle the largest provided
they are kept carefully oiled and cleaned.
To keep them in this state of preservation
will require a large number of men, and
they must be men skilled in the handling
of ordnance, which the Infantry is not.
The removal of the artillery from this
post will entail a heavy less on the Gov
ernment."
The prevailing rumors that the Presidio
is to bÂ« made an infantry post are causing
cor.sidera.ble discussion among the officers
connected with the artillery branch of the
service. The fortifications around the bay
cf 6aa Francisco represent the expendi
ture of millions of. dollars and to Intrust
their care to the hands of the Infantry
will, according to the views of artillery
experts, mean a great loss. The infantry,
they eay, is cot skilled in the handling and
care, of large guns, and the intricate'me
chanism of the .pieces around the shores
rf the bay, in the hands of inexperienced
persons would eoon be in a state render

foil Forr.c-what into the background to-day. An
effort rear made by the traders to bring for
vard some of the other railroad stocks to take
the place of these recent favorites. These did
not avail to fill the gap left by the quietude
Ol the mercurial Fl*"cia!UeF, but the day's deal
ings had an apwarance of rather better dis
tribution as a res-Jit of these new evidences
of activity and the general tone of the mar
ket was firm and approached to positive
ftrength Bt times. The center of this strength
was the Crancer group, which was favorably
affected by the fhow of Increapei earnings for
th<Â» fo-.irtb week in July by the St. Paul sys
tem. The showing was particularly effective
bÂ«"-auFe it compared with a very high level of
earninsF last year and because St. Paul has
rather bÂ«-n looked upon as the leader o* the
reactionary tendency in railro.-.d earnings Inci
dent to the falling off in general business.
There was no si>eclal feature of traffic to ex
plain the recovery, which contrasts with a de
crease for each of the earlier weeks of the

will say: Trade conditions still favor the
buyer; the general fall demand, though fair
In view of the midsummer conditions. Is still
below expectations and below a year ago; bank
clearings are at the lowest for two years past,'
and failures are slightly more numerous,
though no marked tendencies | are perceptible.
On the other hand gross railway earnings hold
the percentage of gain previously shown and
where prices are madf low enough to satisfy
buyers a heavy business is uncovered and read
ily booked, pointing to the demand being still
present and awaiting dispcsal. The crop situa
tion, as a whole, is better. The outlook for
corn Is for a 2,100,000,000 bushel crop. Spring
wheat is turning out better In quality and
quantity than expected and there has been an
unquestionable Improvement in cotton crop con
ditions. The yield of apples was the largest in
many years and fruits generally are yielding
liberally, and commanding good prices.
The Iron and steel Industry furnishes the most
notable example of reduced prices. Inducing a
heavy business, and while the outlook Ms still
a confused one the volume of trade In finished
material, notably bars and plates, is very
large. â¢
Foundry pig Iron has been In better demand
but at concessions, and the drift of crude prices
generally Is toward a lower level.
More Inquiry la reported for rails at the
West and for iron at the South, but ship room
capacity obstructs business.
The cereals are all lower this week, partly
on better crop reports, partly on lower. cablea
but , largely on the growth of bearish feeling
after the late reaction.
Beef products are generally higher on army
demand, while tin is seeking a lower level In
sympathy with foreign markets and Increased

road has given the Government a freight rate
on/ Oats of 60c per ctl from. Eastern points
clear through to Yokohama or Hongkong. The
rate from Chicago to San Francisco Is 55c. This
immense decrease in the through rate enables
Chicago to completely undersell San Francisco
for Government account. With a price of 22c
per Dushel at Chicago, the latter can land Oats
at either Oriental port at $1 35, whereas San
Francisco cannot , possibly do it at a quotation
to-dav ,of $1 20 per, ctl under $1 63. This dis
crimination In favor of Chicago may ; account
for the recent falling off In , the Government
demand for Oats.
The China steamer last week took out about
10,500 ctls of Oats In transit for this account,
and yesterday the America Maru took out 10.-
CHICAGO, Aug. 3.â Wheat opened with buy
ers in the majority. The brief session at Liver
pool resulted in an advance of %d In prices
there. As local prices declined lc yesterday,
this naturally had considerable" effect. There
was a good deal of covering by yesterday's
sellers at the opening and buying by profes
sional longs. September opened at 75H@75*4c
compared with yesterday's closing price of 74?i
<?I747flC. The advance was maintained but a
short time. Primary receipts were very large,
nearly 50 per cent larger than a year ago. and
the quality of receipts of new wheat at Minne
apolis was said to be the best in years. As
soon as: the opening demand was satisfied the
market turned weak. Bears took advantage of
the lack of buying orders to put pressure on
the market and prices slid off very easily un
der the raiding 1 , September dropped to 74V4c,
with hardly a rally of consequence. It then
rallied to 75V4c, but again declined to 74?i@74v8C,
chiefly on account of lack of support, and not
until the session was near the close did the
market develop 'any real strength. Then re
ports pf heavy cash business I and export en
gagements began to come in, local as well as
outside points reporting a good business. Sep
tember rallied to 75%c and closed at 75Vi'S75?io
bid. *
Corn, with the exception of a few moments
of lirmnpss around the opening, was weak and
lower all day. The weather was good and the
favorable crop prospects . encouraged selling.
September closed lower.
Oats were dull, but fairly steady. Septem
ber closed %c hleher. V
Yellow fever reports were the one factor In
provisions. Opening prices showed material
declines for lard and until late in the session
the market was extremely weak. The close
was heavy, September pork 15c lower, lard 2H@
5c lower and ribs 5@7cVi lower. .

NEW YORK. Aug. 3.â Bradstreefs review of
the New York stock market will Bay to-mor
row: This has been a week of pronounced
dullness, accompanied by variability In move
ment of stock market prices. Present specu
lative conditions may, of course, be partly due
to the summer season and the temporary re
duction in the numbers of both professional and
outside operators. There would seem, how
ever, to be some points of difference between
an ordinary midsummer market and the exist
ing situation in Wall street. At present th?
fear of an unsettling of prices on account of
the Presidential campaign or the Chinese com
plications seems to overhang the market and
render -the regular participants In speculation
cautious about their operations, while the pub
lic Is indifferent, or it might be said Indis
posed to touch stocks except in the way of
investment. The buying of securities for the
latter purpese has naturally fallen oft at this
season, but the fact remains that the floating
supply of dividend-paying railroad shares 19
greatly reduced and offerings of such stocks
are on a restricted scale, which seriously'em
barrasses the efforts of bear operators to de
press the general market. As might be ex
pected there was more or less bearish manipu
lation in various parts of the list. Sugar and
Tobacco stocks coming in for a notable share
of this, but rallies followed quickly after each
depression. London was not a prominent factor
and though it was a seller on a small scare
here the disposition abroad was apparently to
take a more favorable view of the Chinese sit
uation. This to a certain extent steadied the
market, but on the other hand the fact that
the London market was preparing itself fcr
a large new war loan and discount is up to
iVz per cent there, had a bad effect on views as
to the future of the money market, supplement
ed as it Is by the belief that all the European
countries will have to borrow largely to de
fray the cost of their operations in China.
The fact that no gold was shipped this week
from New York was offset by the rise of ex
change dated at the end of the week, with
the firmness of money In London being taken
as an indication that the gold will be with
drawn from this side.
Butter, Cheese and Ess* stand the same ai
last week.
Meats show no change, but the wholesale
markets are growing firmer. Poultry is in
heavy supply,' with low prices for small ar>d
younjr fowl.
There is nothing new In fruits and vegetables,
both being abundant.

CLOSING
NEW TORK, Aug. 3.-The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The markets here were still very idle to-day,
but the news harder. Investment securities par
ticularly being In demand. Americans were
listless and Baltimore and Ohio issues were
weak on realization on declaration of the divi
dend. Union Pacific was pood, but entirely on
New York support. Rio Tlntos were strong
early In the day on Paris buying, but later
they relapred. Anacondas, however, held the
rise owing to New York support. The Stock
Exchange here will be closed Saturday and
Monday.
London Market.
The foreign demand for bituminous coal la
heavy, but producers hesitate to contract ship
ments while prices tend upward. While. prices
are above the 1899 opening In woolens, they are
materially below the figures reached later last
Reason. The wool market has been active. An
average of 100 quotations on August 1 was
pllghtlf below J20 51. "Wide sheetings are re
duced 15Â© 20 per cent, but the decline attracU
more business.
Copper exports for July are estimated at 10,
0C1 tons, against 7160 in 1&99, and the amount
coming Into sight In the first half year for
home consumption is only 05,023 tons, a -de
crease of 19.4G7 tons.
It 1Â« often hard to read encouraging symp
toms of general business In declining prices of
commodities, but Just now It Is reasonable to
look for them. Some raw materials and some
manufactured products, one 'stage, removed
from the raw, are selling at lower prices than
at any time since last year's advance set In;
but there Is confidence among buyers that the
downward Â¦ swing is nearly over, while sellers
are adopting a cautious policy, Â«hich until re
cently characterized the attitude of buyers.
Iron and eteel markets were startled by
reports of sales of steel bars at 90c per 100
pounds, but business at the same time was
the larjjest in months at Chicago on a basis of
about |1 25. Increasing demand for bar iron
from makers of agricultural Implements and
car-builders was a feature, contracts being
placed estimated at 110,000 tons in bars and
plates. , The trade believes that orders will
Increase as the season advances and that the
total needs of Iron consumers will compare well
with last year. Heavy bids appear for foun
dry iron, buyers being uneasy, without reduc
ing, and selling prices of many descriptions ap
proximating cost. Export orders Increase and
makers do not fully accept reports of purchases
or foreign rails for delivery in the South. Some
traders are not satisfied with the result of
Chicago's confidence, pointing to the report of
the production of piglron In the first half of
the year, exceeding all records, and contrast-
Ing it with the recent dull markets.

be distinguished chiefly for that reason.
They have mastered the art of putting
down Infinite quantities of Munich beer."
Professor Charles Mills Gayley gave an
address on the English university. Hu
said: "I am thoroughly converted to tho
honor system, the system of close com
petition. It Is good for a thoroughbred to
eprint occasionally. Our university life la
too much of a dead level of mediocrity."
In discussing the German university
Professor George 8. Stratton said: "While
they work they work: but they do not
try to study all the year round. The Ger
man university Is run on the European
plan; a man pays for what he Rets. He
goes to hear men and pays in proportion
to what he takes."
Professor Stratton expressed himself as
being heartily in favor of tuition fees,
saying: "The idea of free higher educa
tion is the outgrowth of an unhealthy
sentimentality. Its reaction Is vicious,
and the system, I believe, will destroy
itself."

f-it jHE present demand for realty Is
mostly for wholesale, factory and
H warehouse properties. Attention is
called to this feature of the present
situation in the current number of the
Real Estate Circular published by
Thomas Magee & Sons.
"One proof of this," says the Circular,
"is that in addition to purchasing four
fifty-vara lots on the east corner of Sec
end and Folsom, the Union Iron Works
have added a block to their Potrero hold
ings, by purchasing from the Fair estate
block 4S5 there for $45,000. Another proof
Is that the Gorham Rubber Company, a
strictly home concern, has leased the
whole fifty-vara lot on the northeast
(northerly) corner of Mission and Fre
mont streets, for a term of years. A two
story brick structure with six elevators,
is to be erected on the lot for that com
pany. It will occupy a portion of the
â¢building, and sublet the remainder to
other manufacturing concerns. Another
proof Is that a local machine shop has
bought the vacant lot on the southwest
corner of Second and Vernon streets, 29S
fÂ»et southeast of Folsom. 110 feet in front
by 156 feet in depth, and 13x110:6 in rear,
for $15,500. The lot. now partially cut
down, is to be fully graded.
"No business sales have been reported
on or north of Market street. So tar aa
dwelling property is concerned, medium
priced lots and houses and lots are at the
moment most sought after.
"The total numDer of sales made last
month was 231. of the value of $1.:M7,1'Â«.
The number of sales in July. IS'jO, was iiJ.
of the aggregate value of JMMll. This in
crease in July of this year in the value
of sales fairly represents the improvement
in real estate this year over last."
The Circular classifies the city and
county sales during July as follows:
Car No. 165 of the Haight-street line
cr.T^bed jnto a waenn loaded with cans of
mil. at the junction of Market and
Hh iphl streets last night, smashing the

The driver of the wagon, whose name
5 Harry Ktii, attempted to drive in

but bravely held on to the reins, prevent
ing the hrrses from tunning away.
Many Â«Â»f the passengers looked as if
th'cv had beon in a snowstorm. Several
v. men had their costly garments ruined,
and with many expressions of regret for
their drÂ«9ses and condemnation for the
milkman they hurriedly left the car and
returned tÂ« their homes.
The men treated the situation good
naturedly and after wiping the milk from
their clothes assisted the driver of the
vi-.pon in checking his maddened team.
Fortunately for Korn he escaped with a
few slight bruises.
CABLE CAR CRASHES
INTO A MILK WAGON
Joseph Canti, who resides at 112 Taylor

night, and while leaving the place he felt
some orite tugging at his chain. He turned
around and saw a man with part of the
chain and a pair of nippers in his hands
Canti grabbed the thief nnd after a
hard struggle turned him over to Police
man Wilson. While at the patrol box the
man feigned drunkenness and on the way
to the City Prison made his pretensions
much stronger.
When the prison was reached the man
refused to give his name and suddenly
lapsed Into an apparent unconscious state.
He was taken to the Receiving Hospital
and efforts made to revive him, but with
out result. Officer Wilson says he feels

near the entrance to the theater. Â¦

AWFUL ACCIDENT AT THE NILSON RANCH.
OAKLAND, Aug. 3. â By the explosion
of a coal oil lamp last night Mrs.
. Bengta Olson Nilson was fatally
burned and her aged husband, Ole
Nilson, suffered severe injuries In an hero
ic but futile effort to Â£*ive his wife from
a frightful death. The accident occurred
at the Nilson ranch in Happy Valley, near
Lafayette, Contra Costa County. Mrs.
Nilson was brought to Fabiola Hospital
by her husband as soon as he could drive
here, but every attention of the physicians
was unavailing and the aged woman died
this morning at 7 o'clock.
Nilson and his wife were sitting at sup
per about 9 o'clock last evening when Mrs.
Nilson, in reaching across the table for a
paper, knocked over the lighted lamp. The
lamp exploded as it fell, splashing the
blazing oil over Mrs. Nilson, who was
ablaze from head to foot in an instant.
The fire spread so quickly that before Mr.
Nilson who was sitting opposite, could
rush around the table the unfortunate
woman ' was completely enveloped in
flames.
Nilson grabbed a quilt from a bed and
tried to smother the blazing clothings The
oil spattered upon him and several times
his garments were afire. He struggled des
perately to save his suffering wife, but
â¢when the flames were finally extinguished
Mrs. Is'llson was unconscious and dying.
The old man was badly burned about
the arms and It Is feared may suffer the
loss of his right hand from the injuries
he sustained.
While the husband was working over his
wife the house caught fire, but John Rob
inson, a ranchhand, saved It from being
destroyed.
Nilpon paid no attention to his own seri
ous burns, but wrapped his wife In blan
kets and drove twelve miles to Oakland
with the dying woman In the hope of get
ting medical attention. Dr. Larkey and
the hospital staff did all that was possi
ble, but they found that not a portion of
the patient's body had been left untouched
by the flames.
Mrs. Nilson was well known In Oakland
as well as at her home, where she had
lived for many years. She was 65 year3
old and a native of Sweden. There are
hree sonsâ Henry Olson and Nils Olson,
grocers of this city and San Francisco,
md Magnus Olson of San Jose. The fu
leral will be held on Sunday from the un
lertaking parlors at 4d."> Thirteenth street,
rhe interment will he in Mountain View
>metery. The Olsons reside at 706 Tenth
street In this city.
The Physician "Was in This City on
His Way Home After a
Visit to Bartlett
Springs.
I>r. G. G. Shannon, a prominent phy
sician of Tulare County, was found dead
in bed in his room at the Lick House
at 2 o'clock this morning.
Dr. Shannon had been at Bartlett
Springs for some time and stopped for a
few days In thl3 city on his way home.
He had been under medical treatment for
some time.
Dr. Shannon retired early last evening
In fairly good spirits and left orders con
cerning his proposed departure for home.
Mrs. Shannon awoke at 2 o'clock and
asked her husband if he wanted to take
any medicine. Receiving no answer she
turned up the gas only to find that her
husband was dead.
The hotel attaches were apprised of the
fact and immediately summoned an un
dertaker to take charge of the remains.
Nothing could be learned from any of
the employes of -the hotel regarding the
sudden death of Dr. Shannon. The clerk
on duty refused to affirm or deny the
fact that there ,had been any death in
the hotel, but was negotiating with the
undertaker for the removal of the re
mains. Later the Morgue was notified
of the case.
Dr. G-. G. ShaDnon Passes
Away Sometime During
the Night.

edged eminence as a lawyer. W. F.
Herrin was invited to serve in the
law department of the Southern Pa
cific because he had gained a reputa
tion while attorney for Spring Val
ley as a clever manipulator of corrupt
Supervisors. Pillsbury was engaged
because he possessed character and
conscience. Herrin was employed be
cause he possessed neither.
Among the depraved agents of the
Southern Pacific Law Department is Bo-
Kus Telegram Lynch. He draws a salary
from tho Government and works for the
Southern Pacific. When political work of
an exceptionally disreputable kind is de
manded Lynch constitutes the supply
which follows demand. Government du

get help from the State Central Com
mittee.
As a matter of plain fact the pro
prietor of this paper and E. S. Pills
bury liave never discussed, one 'with,
the other, political topics. There is
not a shadow or semblance of truth
in the rumor of alliance or desire on
their part to displace the existing
State Central Committee. The story
of such alliance and prqgramme was
put forth by Herrin and told by
Lynch, Crimmins and Kelly for the
plain purpose of arousing in the State
Central Committee a spirit of resent
ment against men who stand for hon
est government and decent politics.
The members of the State Central Com
mittee may rest assured that they will
receive the earnest dnd active support of
The Call in their efforts to win Republican
success in this campaign.
The rumor that Mr. Pillsbury desires to
succeed Colonel Stone as chairman of the
committee comes straight from the law
department of the- Southern Pacific. Her
rin is Jealous of Plllsbury.
The public should know that Mr.
Pillsbury has been appointed to a
position in the law department of the
Santa Fe Railroad which corresponds
in rank with the position which Her
rin holds in the Southern Pacific. Mr.
Pillsbury's splendid abilities and le
gal talents excite the envy of Herrin.
Moreover, Mr. Pillsbury is a Re
publican â a stalwart, fearless, clean
and consistent Republican whose sup
port is worth something to the cause
of honest . government.
Should the Republican party of
California go to Herrin, an old line
Democrat, for advice and inspiration?
Mr. Pillsbury was chosen to represent
the Santa Fe because of his acknowl-
bosses cannot win unless they can
It is clearly understood that the
THE decision of the Supreme Court
declaring the primary election law
void renders it necessary that the
Republican State Central Commit
tee shall issue a new or revised
i call for a State convention. The com-
I mittee will meet for this purpose In
: Golden Gate Hall this afternoon. It is
'Â¦ expected that the proceedings will have a
bearing on the methods of electing dele
! gates to the various nominating conven
! tlonF.
| At this time The Call deems it proper
' and fair to make a statement for the ln
: formation of the officers and members of
' the committee. A rumor has been free
i ly circulated by the agents of Hcrrin and
1 the followers of Crimmins and Kelly that
j the proprietor of this paper and K. S.
'Â¦ Plllsbury are planning for the flection of
delegates to the State Convention who will
advocate th* displacement of the existing
| State Central Committee and favor the
j selection of a new governing body of the
; party. The motive for the rumor can be
easily traced.
It is common knowledge that the present
Republican County Committee of San
Francisco derived its being from a con
vention chosen by anti-boss Republicans
and is expected to cast the weight of its
i influence in favor of electing clean and
; able delegations to the nominating con-
I ventions. The authors of the false rumor
hope to prejudice the State Committee
against the local body and to cause the
i former committee at its meeting to-day to
j embarrass the County Committee with
i Ironclad restrictions.

The opposing faction was bitter in de
nouncing the action of the chair after the
meeting was over, and the feeling may
cause a serious break in the club. Those
who favored the election of delegates say
it could have been done Just as well as not
in spite of the Supreme Court's decision
against the primaries by making the nom
inations subject to the approval of the
County Committee. It was evident from
the chair's ruling that he is in favor of

There's where the Pacific Improvement
Company turned. The hotel, had never
paid the Improvement Company. It had
lost money on it. The Southern Pacific,
however, had been a gainer by passengers
and freight. "Greater benefits, bigger
antes." argued the Pacific Improvement
Company.
Secretary Richard . Derby of that cor
poration, when seen yesterday, said: "The
matter of erecting a new hotel has been
thought ofâ yes. But let me tell you that
my company will take no steps toward
that end. We lost money on that place.
I think we shall sell the site or else rent
It to campers."
Huntington's latest "wise move" recall*
the split in the original Southern Pacific
corporation. In which he played such a
Machiavellan part. When Senator Stan
ford died and his estate was distributed
off went all the Stanford heads in the
Southern Pacific employ. Then when
Crocker came into the game B. U. Stein
man, who ran the depot- privileges at
Sacramentor dropped out and his place
was taken by one Hanchett. a brother-in
law of the Crocker boys. As soon as the
Crocker estate was sold out Hanchett
retired and Stelnman once more "bobbed
up serenely."
And so the game has gone, but If has re
mained to the Pacific Improvement Com
pany to administer the unkindest cut ot
all and shake. the grip the old man of the
railroad thought he had on what he
regarded as a docile catspaw for the ab
straction of golden chestnuts from Castle
Crag flre. -
Phenixlike, out of the ashes of Castle
Crag Tavern renewed trouble between
Collis P. Huntington. representing the
Southern Pacific, and the Crockers and
Stanfords, who stand for the Pacific Im
provement Company, has arisen. Hunt
ington says to the Pacific Improvement
Company, "Rebuild the Castle Crag
Hotel." The Pacific Improvement Com
pany replies that it will see him in Peking
first. Once was enough; never again. At
least, that's the gist of the remarks when
the subject comes up.
The Pacific Improvement Company is
willing to live up to Its name so far as the
Pacific is concerned, but .when Paciic
stands for Southern Pacific they register
a vigorous kick. :
The Pacific Improvement Company is a
vermiform appendix of the Southern Pa
cific â a sort of mutual benefit system.
"Help one another" is the motto of the
two corporations, but the Pacific Im
provement Company says that the "one
another" is a euphemism for Southern
Pacific. â¢
The Improvement Company is quite a
Crocker concern. Its offices are in the
Crocker building and George Crocker is
president. Some Crockers are sharehold
ers. So is Mrs. Stanford and so is Collia
P. Huntington. There's the rub. "When
Castle Crag burned a nice bunch of
money which. used to. pour "into the South
ern Pacific coffers through the medium of
tourists' tickets was "diverted into other
channels. Huntington. with his well
known system of logic/figured out that as
the hotel had belonged to the Improve
ment Company it was up to them to erect
a new caravansary. When the first hotel
was built Huntington was not a member
of â¢ the "annex," and ; therefore he of
course could not be expected, as a recent
shareholder, to take any part except a
thinking one in the building of the new
hotel. - â¢

Chairman McDonald extended the mem

was then learned that owing to a light at
tendance at Pythian Castle one of the
braves had been sent to reeormoiter and
had rounded up a sufficient number of his
camp who were attending the County
Committee meeting as members to give
the wigwam a quorum. The rule of divi
sion made It impossible for both bodies,
meeting, as they did. on the same night,
to gather enough of their members to
transact business, and in consequence the
County Committee was forced to with

FOR CONTEMPT
The stable owned and occupied by
Michael Powers was totally destroyed. At
the outbreak of the flre neighbors, seeing
the danger to the barn, broke open the
doors and dragged the frightened animals
to a place of safety. John Cornish, who
owned the adjoining stable, suffered no
loss, t He took no chances of the flames
spreading and dragged his horses and
wagons out of their resting place.
Timothy Kelleher, who lives at lS^i Sum
ner street, and Con Austin, who resides
at 2<% Sumner street, suffered damage to
their goods by water.
Sparks from the burning structures set
flre to the roof of Mrs. Mary Donnelly's
home afc 19%' Sumner street, and for a
time a second conflagration seemed immi
nent. The firemen quickly subdued the
flre and all danger was averted. The
buildings on Sumner street were owned
by Emll Orack, 1147 Howard street. They
were slightly t insured.
Fire Marshal Towe after an investiffa.
tlon stated that the flre was caused by hot
ashes in an iron ash can which rested
against the fence in the little alleyway
that separated the houses. He pointed to
the overturned barrel and said that the
flimsy woodwork was Ignited by the red
hot ashes. He gave it as his opinion that
the rookeries that were on fire were worse
than those in Chinatown. The flre laddies
had a hard time battling the flames. They
had to flght the conflagration from all
sides. Winding alleys and high fences
impeded their every movement.
It was shortly after midnight that the
residents of that vicinity were aroused
from their slumbers by the odor of smoke,
the crackling of names and the shouts of
people in the streets. Harry Thompson,
a painter, who lives at 22 Sumner street,
was aroused by his wife and they quick
ly carried their two children to a place
of safety and returned to save what little
furniture they could. Their property was
damaged by water and was not insured.
Benjamin Adair, an employe of the Inde
pendent Electric Light Company, living
at 16VÂ£ Sumner street, carried all his
household effects into, the street. E. H.
Evans, who lives in the rear of 221EighLh
street, was unable to save his goods and
chattels. He .helped 'his wife to a place
of safety . and then remembered the
woman who -lived downstairs, and rushed
back and aided her in brlnglng-.her little
ones out of' danger.
Below him lived a- Miss "'Sweeney, a
woman of past' 'middle age. The latter
was almost frightened to death by the
excitement, and the neighbors had a hard
time comforting her and getting her out
of her hysterics. Mrs. William Hoffman,
whose rooms adjoined Miss Sweenoyts,
was aroused from . her sleep by the heat.
She shook her husband and they wrapped
their three babes in blankets and carried
them to the home of a neighbor. Their
furniture was not insured and they will
probably suffer a heavy loss. The prop
erty in which Airs. Hoffman, Air. Evans
and Miss Sweeney lived was owned by
Mrs. Mary Sweeney, who cabled a' light
insurance on the buildings.
extent ot several thousands of dollars was
done before the lire could be got under

Residents in the vicinity of Eighth and
Folsom streets had a narrow escape from
death by fire at an early hour this morn
ing. Without warning their slumbers were
rudely disturbed by cries of flre and the
crackling of flames in their very midst.
Children were caught from their beds and
hurried into the streets, and men and wo
men rushed frantically about to save
what belongings they could. An alarm
was turned in from box 1S4 and within a
few minutes a second alarm was turned in
and the Fire Department was soon bat
tling the names. The tire was confined to
the center of the block and destroyed
property in the rear of Sumner, Eignth
