. turned- over' his- sixth charge, having
made, a record of saving. six lives on the
same day, unassisted and by his own per
sonal effort.
Whatever his mysterious 111 luck in" the
capacity of "hoodoo," life saving seems
to have, been directly in Patterson's line.
He 'wears -a 'medal which was given him
by nn* English humane society for having
saved a, number of lives in a ferry boat
accident on ~ the river Thames, and when
the : Ecclefechan was " dismasted In a
storm* off the California , coast * he hung
on to the rail of the pitching vessel and
caught three out of four men who had
washed overboard, as they washed back
to the deck. ThÂ» fourth . was drowned,
and the crippled vessel began her seven
teen days' run to port with a number of
others missing from the crew.
Patterson also wears a gold watch and
chain which was " presented to him by
Lord 'Charles Beresford. through his offi
cers; In recognition of his services as
chief gunner In the. service of a British
war vessel.
"I was twenty-three years in the ser
vice of the Queen." says Patterson, "an*
most o' the time on gunboats. I was wi*
the guns" In 'the 'Egyptian war, upon the
White' Nile. I was chief gunner for the
famous gunboat Condor, with I-ord Beres
ford In command, and at El Tel and Tel

I < I Patterson. Sailors are not gen-
JL erally accredited with being Veil
up on darky ditties, but they
can go the dusky pÂ«--ai>le one better on
superstitions, .^nd in the case of the "hoo
doo" eteward thrlr tsupenstition seems to
have b**en vertned by a most remarkable
SfcS^s of rnifhaps and calamities.
JtÂ»>ward Patterson is an Innocent-look
ing", portly little Scotchman, and doesn't
look a bit like the eort of person to scat
ter bad luck and disaster wherever he
goes, but that Is what he has been doing
for the past 'steen years, wnenever he
puts out to sea tho ship he goes on catches
flre. springs a leak, gets dismantled in a
Etorm, capslze3 or does some other un
comfortablo thing, and the fact is so
widely known among the sailors that It
!s now almost impossible to get a crew to
ship on a vessel where Patterson Is stew
ard. . .
Just now the hoodoo steward Is recuper
ating at St. Mary's Hospital, while thÂ©
Windsor Park, an English coaling vessel,
and the last that Patterson sailed on, is
unloading a cargo of smoldering coal over
at Sausallto. The Windsor Park arrived
a few days e.rr> with her cargo on fire,
having completed the last eight-days-of
the voyage, with burning coal ion board.
"Wtvput out from Newcastle. Australia,
In good trim.", says the little Scotchman,
"an' we had smooth "saHIn. 1 till eight days
out 'o' port, when the bad Juck turned
Icose and the coa! caught fire. It*. was
pmolderin' dowhin the hold. 1 and the tem

In a way that set the boys to shakin' and
GflU!n\weak In the pins. We kep' heavin'
the hot coal overboard: as fast as the tup
o' tho cargo ko l hot. arid it wns a case o'
workin' to save tho ship and all on board.
When we got into port the hull crew was
about played out, r.n' if we'd been a day
or po out that'd ' a' been the last of the
Windsor Park and all o' board o' her."
Every man along the water front re
members when the British ship Breblcc'i
cam** into port afire and' was beached at
SausalHo. -It was another cargo of coal,
nnd the fire had started down In the hold.
They supposed that eome water had
leaked through and started It. but what
ever Its origin tho crew had a hard strug

could get into port When they did get
In the whole ship was on fire, flames
bursting out dVer.the sides and climbing
the masts. The men were exhausted, and
another Â» hour or so would have ended
everything' with them. As It was the
cargo was a total loss and theBreblock
badly damaged.
Patterson was steward of her.
A year later there was an appalling
wreck on thÂ© Newcastle bar. The vessel
had lost her bearings and 'was tossed
about' all night In a furious storm. Th*
masts . and rigging were gone, and the
uhlp was entirely beyond control. When
dawn came' the. sailors sighted the coast
r.rd jaw the wave's breaking oti the bar.
They gave ui> all hope and prepared to
Inuircli tho lifeboat?, but before ahythlna
could be done the vessel was '-dasher! to
pieces on th<Â» rocks of the bar. A number
cf the crew were saved, and among them
was the "hoodoo." The -vessel wns the
British -ship Durisdeer. formerly the City
of Lahore.' Â¦ â¢
Patterson was" steward of her. f
'Â¦] The. Keclefechan, bound -for Liverpool***
came down the Oregon coast /rom Port
land and was caught in a fearful storm
at sen. Her mania -were literally twisted
to pieces and blown away; four men were
washed .overboard and consternation took
possession. When the storm finally
calmed the. crippled hull put Into San
Francisco In distress. :
Patterson^ was steward of her.
The J^lalrrnore had a bad' accident 'off ;
the Mexican coast. She ran in. too close .
to shore and came near being sunk.' Day
light found . the vessel ,, stranded on a
pmooth bar. the worse for wear to tha ex-'
tent of- some nineteen thousand- dollars.
Patterson was steward of her.
Later the Elalrmore capsized In Mission
Bay. * ,
. Patterson wa3 near at hand. -
lie had just left his position as steward
of the Blairmore 'and was on board an-
other vessel in the bay near by when the
accident occurred; If the' little Scotchman
had had anything, to do withi the "hoo
dooing" of that' vessel he worked hard" to]
make recompense. He made his way to
the capsized vessel and rescued four men Â¦
in a small boat,' then went back and saved
another, finally crowning his heroism by
diving for the apprentice , boy of the ship, â¢
and bringing him up by means of the ap

Patterson was on board thÂ© Condor on
the occasion of thÂ« bombardment of Alex
andria, and In description of tha fapaous
event the old Bailor Iapse3 Into his native
vernacular In a way that defies Imitation.
-When thÂ© guns were booming from thÂ©
forts and thÂ© attacking- British vessels
â¢were held tn check by tha fire, a Uttla
jrunboat shot out from among: thÂ© vessels
ana made a gallant dash, running un
harmed light under the line of farts and
through the fire of tha runs, delivering
now and then a terrific and telllns crash.
each time knocking a goodly portion off
the stone fort Into ruin. It was thÂ© Con
dor, under command of thÂ© fearless Lord
Beresford, and when she wheeled round
and circled back unscathed to th* firing
Jlne therÂ© was a great applausÂ© of boom-
In? guns and ships' whistles. Admiral
Eeymour, In command of the attack, â¢!e
naled from his vessel. "Well donÂ©. Con
dor," and the message of approval ha*
been Identified with Lord Beresford, mrtr
fineÂ©. Recently when hÂ» was visitor-
America an Englishman In thÂ» crowd
yelled out. "Well done. Condor," and the
cry was taken up.
"An* he a good mon, too. "says Pat
terson, who was chief gunner of thÂ© Con
dor, "an* aye had a good word for we*l
done work."
Lord Beresford evldentlyha-1 morÂ» tUan
good words for his worthy assistants, ft*
witnessed by the gold watch and chain
which the old gunner wears with modest
pr!dfÂ». It was given In approval of brave
work dutifully done, and as a souvenir re
calls the eventful day at Alexandria wSsn
ruined forts v.tre topnll^ir. cannons booai
lng. whole squads of men being: killed,
guns being 1 dismounted and magazines In
the earthworks being blown up. With par
donable pride the bid man. who Is now
known oi-.ly as the "hncioo steward," can
look Lack upon his day cf glory, when hÂ»
wes thief gunner of the gallant Condor.
The "hooÂ«loo" steward Is a pensioner ot
the British Government, and to such a
comfortable extent that h-Â» doesna ha'
tn work." he says, unless hÂ© so desires*.
But he so desires. "'Once a sailor alwaja
at sea," and Patterson, like all nallorÂ«r,
fee's himself an alien on land. So thus It
Is that the "hoodoo" steward Is keeping a
weather eye open for a chance to ship aj
steward. The chanr-e lrÂ» rather a slim one.
The Windsor Park sailors don't want
him; that last cargo of burning coal set
tled-U with them, and they look askance
whenever he comes n?ar. His uncanny
reputation. In, spite ot hts many braveries,
casts Its shadow before him. and when
ever he applies for n stewardship on
board a vessel the captain looks serious,
and there Is trouhle aboard if the sailors
hear of It. If Patterson ships thÂ© sailors
disappear; for they fear the "hoodoo."
Withal, the hoodooed steward does not
mind It much. It Is not In the way oC
sailors to mind anything much. And hÂ»
has his pension. "If the' canna take ma
o' ship," says he. "I ca' pay my way an*
gae t" Edlnborough. I Jus* ha* my mitner,
an* she Is auld. She lives ba* there."
Just how much there Is in the theory of
"hoodoo" Interference 'with mundanÂ© af
falrs is a matter of opinion. Down on tha
water front the opinion Is very strong:,
and It differs very tittle. Th* "hoodoo"
steward himself thinks It Is rather queer,
and when asked whether he is a hoodoo.
In bis droll Scotch way hÂ« replies:
â¢â¢It ktana looks tha* w'y."

times accompanied by oedema of the eye-

Is the result cf Inflammation of th* glands
that surround the eyelashes. Is Is of no
gravity- in Itself, but" in tho case of some
persona it returns with such tenacity that
U becomes a real infirmity. With persons
of this class, therefore, preventive treat
ment requires to be conducted wtth e*vV
treme care. As soon as the sty appears an
attempt may be made to stop it at t&a
outset by a slight cauterization with nit
rate of silver, or else with a pencil dipped
In tincture of Iodine. When it has reached
the ful! period of Inflammation the treat

of a few poultices of starch cr of con
jiresses dipped in n slightly antlÂ» t .pt'ic

The favorable results that have been ob

of PanÂ» the idea uf resorting to thta
treatment for persistent orgeolet In
fact. In several cases in which this affec

that it should. be. beneficially affected by
the well established curative action or

from Las Vegas to the Katon Mountains
that January night. When Silva returned
to his half dozen marauding followers the
next day he said that he nad finished the
job and there would be no more "squeal
ing in Las Vegas." Two months later,
when the Las Vegas jail was filled with
members of the bandit band and there
were confessions of crime, the body of
Mrs. Silva was dug from a shallow grave
in an arroyo near San Pedro. A dozen
mortal stabs about the chest told tho
etory of her death.
Uoth Chavez and Juan Valpardo, an
other member of the gang, came to an un
timely end in March. 1S97. when the Sher
iffs of San Miguel and Santa Fe counties
caught them in a cood-blooded murder
and pursued them vigorously until they
were tried and hanged.
Thieves always fall out. The Silva gang
soon quarreled In their enforced hiding
place. They were mad at the thought
that while they had no money and were
refugees; other partners in crime had
money and .were living comfortably else
where in ' New Mexico. Several of the
band had safely fled to the republic of
Mexico. The men wJth Silva knew that
he had made thousands of dollars by
their own brigandage. It Is natural that
covetousness possessed them, and plans
were not slow for the murder and rob
bery of the chief himself. Who killed
Silva and where It was done has never
been exactly learned, but Gonzales de
Boca and Guadalupe Caballero each testi
fied that Silva was shot in the head while
he was cooking a meal early In February.
lf.97. and that from his body about $13,000
was taken.
Thenceforward the dissolution of tho
band was rapid. Twenty arrests werÂ«
made In a few weeks. Four made full
confessions. Silva wa.s dead. The key
stone gone, the arch crumbfed. For threÂ»
years the cases of the Silva gang have
occupied th*Â» courts in New Mexico. Three
men have been convicted â¢ and hanged
four were not convicted, three had their
sentences commuted to life imprisonment
and nve are serving in the penitentiary
now. â¢
And now there comes from Ourango,
Mexico, the news thÂ»t the last of two es
caping members of the Vicente Silva out-
Jaw band has beerj hanged in Durango
for fresh crime. That ends the nnnals of

were suspicions concerning him in Has

mos. He was indicted for horse and cattle
stealing on November 7. 1896, and became
a refugee from justice. The Governor of
the Territory .and th<; Sheriffs in Northern
Mexico together oCcrcd $5000 for his cap
ture.
Suspecting that his wife and her youth
ful brother. Gabriel Sandoval," were giv
ing information to the Sheriff and secret
organizations of citizens that were then
roused to fever hc:it and were uncovering
the crimes of his band. Silva thought hn
must have th'-m also out of his way. So
he set about planning how. wit!) no suspi
cion of guilt on himself, to kill his wife
and her younger brother. The plans were
finished by January 23, 1Â£97. and on the
evening of that day Silva and Guadalupe
Cahallero rode stealthily iuto Las Vefaa.'
Two policemen in the town, Jullen Tru>
gelio and Jose Chavez Chavez; who had
been partly In league with the robbers
p.nd murderers from the first, were Bought
out. They agreed to go with Silva to his
own adobe home and stand guard at the
door while SJIva and Caballero went in
side to deliberately stab Mrs. Silva
and her brother to death. Jose
Cbavev Chavez was sent ahead to spy
out the situation at tho Silva home be
fore Silva and Caballero '.vent there.
Chavez came back and reported that Mrs.
Silva had company.
The de^d must be done that night any
how, so the murderous scheme Â¦was quick
ly altered. Toung Gabriel Sandoval was
to be lured from his sister's home and
quickly slain. When that was over Silva
was to go home to his wife, as if he had
just come in secret from his refuge in tho
mountains, to force his wife to flee with
him back to the mountains, where her
murder mitrht be accomplished more at
leasure nnd with no witnesses to the
crime. That plan suited Policeman Jose
Chavez Chavez, who did not wi.sh quite
such a wholesale murder as was at first
proposed.
. . So Trugrello was sent to tell Sandoval
Xhat he was wanted bv a sick friend In
finether part of Las Vegas. The young
man responded to the call. Just as he
was hurriedly passinrr alonp a narrow,
clark street lined with one-story arlobe
houses Silva leaped from a dark retreat
and stabbed him. Sandoval uttered a
shriek, and Jose Chavez Chavez, fearing
the noise would arouse the neighbors,
pounded the youth, upon the hend with
a revolver until the skull was fractured

from which it was flug out six months
later.

Had he been a general he could scarcely

who lived on lonely sheep and cattle
ranches out in the foothills were afraid
to po abroad at nieht lest they, too, might
ho found dead at the hands of an un
known murderer. All the cattle ranch
men w* re at their wits' ends to know how
thrir herds had lessened.

man â and his tv.o stalwart sons Â¦were
found dtad at the ranch home on their
eheep rar.Re. thirty miles south of Los
Cerillos. and the pory bodies had bullets
in their heads and stabs in their chest*.
It was generally believed the Pueblo In
dians had again revenged themselves on
the white man. Vicente Silva himself
went about declaring- that he would be
( r â¢ <f a committee to go and bring the
Indians to justice. The ranchmen were
horrified at the crime. It transpired two
years apo, however, that the crime was
ore of the deeds of the Silva care, and
that Colonel Adams was murdered be

How many crimes may be attributed to
the gar.g will never be known. The
crimes were far apart and committed by
different groups of men; many of them,
aiso, were tfcuusht at the time to have

was a saloonkeeper in Las Vegas. He

Mr. Matthews has treated the subject
of heraldry from an American standpoint

has for many years entertained and
taught us. His keen insight Into tha
frailties, fun and folly of the world an<S,
his good-natured comment thereon have,
charmed- us all.
No- book could better serve to diffuse
pood humor than his new "book, "Smiles

humor, and "Will Vawter has filled tho

It is'not quite fair, perhaps, to call thft,

one may say that It is the work of a ,
rhymester who does not take himself too'

"Bohemian Paris of To-Day."
Appropriately to the season of the
French exposition, the J. B. LJppincott;
Company of Philadelphia have Just!
brought out a second edition of "Bohe
mian (Paris of To- Day," by YC\. C. Mor
row from notes by Edouard Cucuel. This,
book when first issued from the press was
one of the most notable publications ojf
the time, . and is an up-to-date account
of the student side of Paris life. It glvesj
an inside view of Bohemian Paris, Its
cafes, its boulevards arid all the features.
that so to make up the attrac
tiveness of that portion of the great capi
tal. It has-been well described as "a com-:
plete guide for those desiring to see tho
Bohemian quarter as It really is. as well
as being one of the most absorbing books
for general reading recently published."
The work has a special attraction to tha
people of San Francisco, Inasmuch as
both its authors are San Franciscans,
though Mr. Cucuel Is now and has been
for some time past a resident of Europe.
It Is therefore a study of Bohemlan*Parls
from a Californlan point of view, and as
such has a local as well as a general in

arm took it and held it higher. Then it
was tied to a cane, and that was spliced
to an umbrella, and a man standing on
the edge of the box waved it and shouted
for a happy half hour.

looking up, I saw young Logan coming
to meet me with a Blaine flag in one hand
and the Stars and Stripes in the other,
singing cut at the top of his voice. "Three

THE MOST TURBULENT CONVEX-
The convention of 1SS8 was a whirlwind.
It takes my breath away now to think
of It. The grand old party elephant came
trumpeting into town, loaded down from
trunk to tail with valiant Ajaxes bravely
inviting the Presidential lightning. Tne
man from the West with the linen duster
hobnobbed with the silk-tiled man from
away down East: the broad-brimmed
planter and his Northern brethren ex
changed ideas and clasped hands lr:
friendship. There was not a dull or un
interesting moment from the beginning
until "taps" were sounded, six days later
The committee! on credentials had n
sorry time In settling differences. Th-
Virginia disputeâ between General Ma
hor.e with his deliciously quaint ways,
gathered trousers and ruffled cuffs, ana
John S. Wise, a strong personality who
diil not care for the aforesaid General
Mahoneâ was most vexing. The delay wi.s
so long that some business had been
transacted, which, of course, was entirely
unparliamentary. This was a self-willed
convention. It was the most turbulert
body 1 have ever seen, save and excepting
a board of trade.
The naming of candidates was finally
reached, eight names being placed before
the convention in this order: Judge dresn
am, Benjamin Harrison, William B. Alli
son, General Alger, Chauncey M. Depew,
John Sherman, Mayor Fitler of Philadel
phia and "Uncle Jerry Rusk. With all
these aspirants in the field there is small
wonder that the convention hall was filled
with a buzz of consultation, trading,
promising and threatening. At least the
sounds which floated up to our iow ba -
cony seemed to convey as much. The bal
loting began with Sherman in the lead,
With Alger second, and so it went till ad
lournment was forced at S o'clock in the
evening. On the fifth day, before an
other ballot was taken. Major McKinley
withdrew. After the tlfth ballot the con
vention adjourned for over Sunday. The
old-time friends of Blaine had hoped that
in the How and ebb of the tide the con
vention would turn to him, and a small
though steady vote had been recorded f_>r
him on each ballot, with the Californian*
alwavs casting their sixteen votes for
"Janiesâ G.â Blaine." But their hopo3
were dashed to the ground when the Edin
burg dispatches came with the request
from Mr. Blaine that his friends and sup
porters should cease their efforts in hjj
behalf. In the eighth ballot Harrison wa3
nominated and the hard-fought battle was
over.
All this time the confusion had been in
describable. Alabama had begged for a
sergeant-at-arrns that she might collect
her vote. The long waits between ballots
had given opportunity to shift the field
a number of times. The weaker brethren
changed masters frequently in this not
able convention, and some of the abler
delegates wavered unaccountably. Would
not you like to know all the ins and outs
of a nominating convention, and how it
is done? Many are the jealousies, broken
promises, and misplaced confidences, but
he who goes upon the battlefield must not
expect too much in the way of careful
handling.
The women of Chicago were out en
masse at all the meetlng3 of this conven
tion, and many distinguished women from
all over the country were present. The
heat was terrific at times, but no one
seemed to mind It. and every woman
clung to her seat until each session was
adjourned.
BLAINE'S LAST CA
The distinguishing feature of the Minne
apolis convention of 1892 was the un
bounded hospitality extended to the dele

Truly, we Californians do not appreciate

things when they see them, win the prizes

own people.
There was trouble all the way through
the Vere-de-Vere lines of the Pelham-

lord that faced a furious family tribe of
English blue-l>!oo<ls, whose names fill
pages in the British peerage. There were
lords and ladies among his kin whose
names would have to be dropped a peg to
allow that of the American girl to take its
place above them.

that there she was just as much a fa
vorite among the girls of her class as
she was with hÂ£r audiences over- the foot
lights. Such winning ways brought many
to her feet, but no one was so persistent
as the young Englishman. Miss May had
no Idea of fettling down as the wife of a
Britisher, and she led his lordship a mer

went she was sure of a better engage

know what failure, hard time or bad luck

Lord Hope lost a portion of his fortune
in backing a London theater where Miss
Yohe was the star, and It was with an
Idea of realizing some benefit from the
useless diamonds that he proposed their
sale. Such a suggestion was extremely
distasteful to the family, for the diamonds
bad made the name famous and gave It
prominence above that which it had
gained even from deeds at arms in the
early wars, and literary achievements in
later times.
The r.ame of Hope is an acquired one.
He is a born Lord in his own right, but

There are cndleps tnysteries connected
with the names of both Lord and Lady;
for ten years or more both have been
under the limelight, or flitting into
shadow, and now more than ever they
are mysterious and rcfiue nil explanations
which would clear the stories. There are
bits of gossip floating about in scraps and
clippings through the papers which re
call how his Lordship was once mixed
up with the fhmous Hope diamonds; one
of which, the Blue Hope, is as famous
aÂ« the Orion* or the Koh-I-Noor.
The diamonds ore of such tremendous
value that the interest on the money they
are worth is like a constant source of ex
pense, or In other words were they sold,
their price invested in California securi

The Blue Hope alone would sell for a sum
that would bring In a thousand dollars a

Still there are those who would take the

The head that wears a crown may lie

There Is a fascination In the possession
of so much wealth concentrated in such

the hand and study it is more entrancing
to one who knows the delight of It than
to view a royal art gallery. The owner of
a diamond becomes its slave and his very

has cost so many lives, for each has its

THROUGH the gallantry of the dele
gates to the National Republican
conventions women have always
been made welcome as spectators
at these splendid gatherings. As I
raise my pen the memories of the conven
tions which I have attended sweep over
me with force and vividness. I seem to
hear the applause, to see the waving ban
ners, and to feel the thrill of the battle
royal.
The nominating conclave of 1S76 was a
"wet blanket convention." It opened with
glory and enthusiasm and closed almost
In silence. Bonfires had been built
throughout the length and breadth of tho
land-a Blaine flag surmounting every one
âand all were ready for the torch, when
he should be nominated. One dignified old
gentleman of whom I wot was up In the
back end of an express wagon, respond
ing to the calls of a singing, cheering
crowd. The burden of his words was "the
Navarre o^f American politics" and his
great fitness for the high duties which
awaited him. The crowd was struck
dumb when the result wds displayed on
the huge plate glass of the newspaper
office. The dear old gentleman climbed
down. and said. "I'm going home to think
it over." Men and women shed tears and
not a single blaze came from those piled
up tar barrels until the regular ratifica
tion meeting. The clear sentiment of the
*76 convention was for Mr. Blaine. He had
more than enough votes to nominate him,
as they came and went, in the seven bal
lots cast, and in the end he lacked only
twenty-seven votes. Gc\-ernor Hayes was
a most worthy gentleman, and it was no
fault of his that he followed in the wake
of the most magnificent craft that ever
sailed our political seas.
ELAINE'S SECOND DEFEAT.
The convention of 1SSO was tragic in Its
intensity. For the third time the greatest
American general. Ulysses S. Grant, was a
candidate. James G. IJIalne. the country's
most distinguished civilian, was the other
chief candidate. By the time the balloting
began the nerves of the convention were
strained to a great tension. An Immov
able body was about to come in contact
with an Irresistible force, and the result
was uncertainty. The first ballot devel
oped the candidatesâ Windom.Was^.burne.
Edwards and Sherman, with Grant and
Klalne leading. Garficld. who was ulti
mately successful, polled only one vote.
Twenty-seven ballots showed no material
change. The excitement was at white
heat. Delegates were receiving telegrams
advising. Instructing, imploring and even
threatening. The voting lasted for two
long days. Grant holding his famous 30(5
and Blaine falling little behind. After the
thirtieth ballot Garfield gained stcudily,
Grant losing nothing. On tho thirty-sixth
ballot Garfiold was declared the victor.
Modest and manly, fair and level headed,
he sat, pale and motionless, when the an
nouncement was made.
The strain was over, and enthusiasm,
sincere if not exuberant, took the place of
nervous nnxioty. The lock was broken,
and almost any result was a relief. How
did the women feel? I only know how one
woman felt. To her tho fight in that con
vention seemed like strife among selfish
boys. Twice had the splendid general re
ceived the highest gift of the nation. I
have always thought that If he had been
appealed to (in the right way. by the right
persons) he would have shown the con
vention that a great general could have
great magnanimity. I believe he could
have been induced to throw -his strength
to one of the other candidates after he
himself had ceased to gain. General Grant
was a deeply generous man, and there Is
a beautiful story, which it is not In my
province now to relate, how he climbed on
his crutches to a -committee room and
made a touching off\r of his services in a
campaign somewhat later.
A CHIVALRIC CONVENTION.
The convention of 1S84, held in Chicago,
was a straight out, open fight. The spirit
of the gathering was chlvalrlc and su
perb. A fight for the temporary chair
manship was begun as soon as the open
ing prayer for prace and guidance had
been delivered. While it lasted, this tight,
won by John R. Lynch of Mississippi, was
intensely exciting, but the usual contest
over the seating of delegates did not take
place, there being no minority report from
the credentials committee.
Whtn it bad reported it was clear that
the main business of the convention was
at hand, and thrills of expectancy ran
through the big assemblage. Fans flut
tered and a hum spread from aisle to
alslo, and the battle- was on. General
Hawley was placed in nomination. Gen
eral Logan's name was presented by Sen
ator Cullom. Then, with stirring words,
Judge West, the blind orator, presented
the name of Mr. Blaine. David of Min
nesota, Goodloe of Kentucky, Platt of
New York and Grow of Pennsylvania sec
onded this nomination. Chester A. Ar
thur, John Sherman and George F. Ed
munds were named. Such a display of or
atory will not occur many times in the
experience of one person. It was a quar
ter of two o'clock In the morning when
adjournment was finally effected.
When the balloting began the next day
all the factions were armed for the fray.
Every officeholder was in position for
Arthur, but the cohorts of Blaine had a
"now or never" feeling, and went into
battle bravely. The strife was clearly
between these candidates, but the other
nominees had seen one such fight in which
neither combatant won. So they took
heart against the day of reckoning. Mur
murs and whisperings flew around.
"Blaine will be nominated." "Too many
office holders here," said the pessimist.
"The Plumed Knight's time has come,"
said another. "Arthur has possession,
and that's nine points," ventured a lis
tener.
VICTORY FOR THE PLUMED
KNIGHT.
The women had taken great Interest In
this convention and had helped to deco
rate the hall and the various headquart
ers. My own big Stars and Stripes, which
I hang out on Fourth of July, Decoration
day and on all gala occasions, covered
one side of the wall in that famous room,
the "ordinary" of the old Grand Pacific
Hotel. This was the headquarters of tho
Blaine leaders, and all Iowa turned out
to make it gay and beautiful and worthy
of the occasion.
When the balloting began the excite
ment ran high. There was no confusion.
Just the rustling of the leaves, the stir of
the breeze which heralded the storm. No
one do red hurry the first tell-tale ballot.
It meant too much. But the crowd did
not wait for the olHcial announcement of
the figures. Individual pencils were quick
to show that Blaine was fifty-six and a
half votes ahead of Arthur, with no one
else in sight. The Blaine adherents
shouted, sang, waved their flags, threw
their hats in the air and shouted and
sang again. The next ballot was almost
as much dreaded, so it was put off by the
victors as long as possible, and the cheer
ing and huzzaing were, kept up until they
were exhausted. It showed a gain of fif
teen votes for Blaine and a loss of two
for Arthur, all the other candidates losing
slightly. The scene after the first ballot
was re-enacted, only the applause was
longer, stronger and more deafening. The
friends of the leading candidates went
from delegation to delegation seeking
more votes.
The third ballot made Blalne'a nomina
tion almost sure. The fourth ballot was
decisive, and James Q. Blaine was de
clared the nominee. Then the crowd went
mad. Tho roar of victory swelled along
the lake front and was taken up by those

ally turned over to them. Citizens left
their comfortable rooir.s, moving into at
tics and servants' quarters that tne guests
might have the best the city afforded.
Nowhere has the national convention been
entertained in so royal a manner.
The town was filled with politicians for
daya before the meeting ot the conven
tion. The Blaine men were in line again
for a long and strong pull for the nomina
tion. The Harrison troops, already in the
saddle, were determined on another Tour
years' run. It was a battle of the ins
and "outs" and the "ins" won. Nearly all
the strife occurred out of convention
hours. Nothing could excel the intensity
of feeling which animated the struggling.
contending crowd. This may sound like
a report of a riot, but no one who saw
the wild and uncontrollable combatants
who rallied and fought for their leaders
in the West House, the night before the
nomination, will say that it resembled a
peace congress or a Sunday school conven
tion. It was simply -awful. All night
long the howling, pushing, excited throng
strove for the ascendency and only gave
up the contest with the breaking of the
dawn.
The convention was called to order on
June 7 by James S. Clarkson. J. Sloat
Fassett was the temporary chairman and
Major McKinley was permanent chair
man. Not until the fourth day were the
nominations reached. Senator Woleott in
a glowing speech nominated Mr. Blaine.
The house was beside itself with excite
ment and cheered and cheered again.
Colonel Dick Thompson in a few well
chosen words placed General Harrison In
nomination. Mr. Depcw made a speech
for Harrison, in the course of which he
Inconsiderately asked the audience who

their seats and led the cheering, voices
gave out and other voices took up the
huzzas. When the delegates were nigh
exhausted Mrs. Richard Kerens, a loyal
friend of Blaine, threw, a fine silken flag
over the edge of the balcony and put new
life into the cause with her cheers. To and
fro waved that eloquent emblem and the
mighty roar of voiced grew louder and
louder. Then came a historic incident.
Mrs. Carson Lake, a beautiful young
woman sitting back of the chairman on
the platform, s-prang to her feet and,
seizing a large star of red. white and blue,
held it aloft and cheered for Blaine.
The effect was electrical. Every one
in the house not for Harrison rose to his
feet. "Louder," cried the beautiful wo
man, and louder came the refrain. Every
heart-throb was quickened. In the nextidolizing Mice.

rarnir.g- B. H. Dibblee of Ross, who, al
though a graduate sir.ee last June, is still
connected with tho athletic life of the
college by virtue, of his position as head
coach of the varsity elevenâ a position
which h*Â» wi'.! hold next full for the sec
ond season. Dibbiee's interests at Har
vard were numerous. In his freshman
year, entering college from Groton School,
he played football on his freshman eleven,
rowed bow in his fre.-hman eight, which
wen the class races, an-J played third base
on his class r^ine. In his sophomore year
he continued playing on the class base
ball team, and was a substitute on the
varsity eleven, which he made, at left
halfback, the following year, and was
elected captain at the close of the season.
As captain of the Harvard football team
nothing can be F^Id of DIbbloe which has
rot already been echoed and re-echoed
throughout the country. He succeeded In
picking an eleven which defeated Tale for
the first time In many years. In the fol
lowing sprir.fr DIbblee played right field
on the varsity nine, and at graduation
held the coveted po?t of marshal.
IMbblee was also prominent In club
circles at Harvard, bring a member of the
Institute of 1770. the D. K. E., the Hasty
Pudding, the Delta Phi. the Signet, and
that exclusive organization the names
even of whose members are not made pub
!!c. the Porcellian Club. As head coach
for the varsity eleven last fall Dibble*
proved highly Fatisfactory. his Intimate
knowledge of the game and of many of
the men composing the team enabling
him to produce an eleven which was only
prevented from scoring on Yale last fall

the New HavÂ«n athletes took when Har
vard had pushed them down to within a

Harvard in the fall to continue his duties
a.Â« head coach.
Of the California boys who are r.ow
actually participating j n t h e activities of
Harvard life, however, probably the most
prominent by virtue of his great ability
Is William T. Belfl of Belraont, a son of
the principal of the Belmont school. Reid
cr.tered Harvard from the Belmont School
In the fall of '37. and at once took a
prominent part !n the athletic activities
of his class. On his freshman eleven at
fullback he had the satisfaction of de
feating the Yale freshmen, and a year
later he experienced a similar satisfaction
as fullback on the varsity eleven. Last
fall be played fullback in the Pennsyl
vania arid Yale games, but was Incapaci
tated durir.g most of the season by a
severe wrenching of the ankle which he
received in a practice game. At the close

tion by a single vote. Much of this re
sult was produced bj the fact that Reid
had already boon elected captain of the
varsity nine for this spring 1 and It was
felt that the duties of both positions'
would be too great for one person to bear.
At baseball Reid has had a similarly en
viable reputation. In his freshman year
his ability v.ith the glove behind the bat
was early recognized and he caught for
his class nine throughout the spring. In
the following year he was the most prom
lsir.g candidate for that position on the
varsity nixie, a post 'which he succeeded

third Yale game last July in New York,

Reid has brought to light has ever been
seen at Harvard before. His plan seems
destined to be as successful as it >was
original.
Reid is a member of many clubs at Har
vard, chief of which are tho Institute of
1770, an organization of the most promi
nent men in the class; the D. IC E., or
"Dickey," as it is more familiarly called,
the Digatnma Club, and the Hasty Pud
ding. His tact, good nature and many
t-plendid qualities make him probably the
best-liked fellow in college.
Although Reid stands almost alone
among California boys at Harvard, by
reason of his varied talents, there are
many others, some of the younger genera
tion of students, who seem destined to be
nearly If not equally prominent. Among
them is Oscar Fulton Cooper of San
Francisco, of the class of 1902. Cooper,
like Reid, became prominent in his fresh
man year, when he played on his fresh
man football eleven. Since then he has
played on the varsity squads as end rush
and may make the team before he leaves
college. He Is a member of the Institute,
the Dickey and the Phi Delta Fsi. His
room is on Mount Auburn street, near
the center of student activity.
Another San Francisco boy at Harvard
Is Philip Bancroft, son of Hubert Howe
Bancroft, the author and publisher.
Young Bancroft is the third of three sons
of the family who has gone East to
school and college, his elder brothers hav
ing graduated from Phillips Kxeter Acad
emy* and from Harvard last year. Phil
Bancroft seems destined to fall In the
spheres of interest in which his brothers
were engaged, for he has already become
a member of the Harvard Gun Club and
is competing in the shoots for the Ban
croft cup, given by his older brother to be
ehot for by the members of the club. The
Bancroft cup Is a well-known institution
at Harvard, which has' already stimulated
wider interest in shooting among college
Etudents.
Another representative of California,
who comes from a different part of the
State, is William Mtrrlam Chadbourne of
Los Angeles, in the senior class. Chad
bourne has all-round talents. As an
oarsman he has often represented the
Weld Boat Club in the races held on the
Charles River; as a lacrosse player he
was a member of last year's Harvard
team, playing at second defense. Chad
bourne is not merely an athlete, how
ever. Recognition of his high grade in
scholarship has already been made by his
election to the Phi Beta Kappa, among
the first In scholarship of his class. In
addition to this honor Chadbourne Is vice
president of the Delta Upsilon Society,
which represents at Harvard, more than
anywhere else, scholarship and literary
influences.
As a member of this society Chadbourne

little old man. familar to most of
\z^ the residents of Berkeley, with
sailor jacket, straw hat and dark
blu<Â« trousers, wending his way with
Ftick in hand along the business thor
oughfares. There is a jaunty air about
him. and a stranger would Immediately
class him a sailor. He is even more, be
ir.g adventurer and wairior as well. There
is something in his general appearance
which speaks of the salt water. He is
greeted familiarly on all sides with
"Hello. Captain." or "Good morning. Cap
tain," and up goes his hand in salute.
Every one knows him, and upon inquiry
will tell you that he is Captain Eastham,
Â¦who served under Commodore Perry In
his famous expedition to Japan. That is
all they know of him. as it is not often
one can get him to talk of himself and
his experiences.
"Captain " Henry S. Eastham lives with
his sister :n a modest little cottage at
2113 Kittredge street. Berkeley. He is
only â¬S years old. but diseases contracted
in that hard campaign in Eastern waters
have crippled him so that he is compelled
to be under continual medical treatment.
He is the typical "salt" of the old school.
Kverythir.g he says has the true nautical
ring. Though extremely modest and
reticent in speaking of his part in the
deeds of that famous old commander.
Commodore Perry, he is affable on anv
other subject. He has encircled the globe
several times, and is thoroughly convers
ant with the history of all nations. Al
though small of stature and crippled,
there remain signs of an exceedingly act-
Jve life. His eyes flash as the old mem
ories come floating back to him, and
often there seem? t obe an overshadowing
radness which creeps into his reminis
cences â probably the thought of neglect of
him by his Government.
The following interesting story of hard
ships, exciting encounters and narrow es
cape* Is told in "Mr." Kastham'sâ as he
prefers to be calledâ own words:
"I was born in New Bedford. Mass.. on
Octol>er 13, 1534. Both my father and
grandfather were seafaring men. my
father brine captain of a brig when 1
left home. I contracted the fever for ad
venture when very young, and on my
thirteenth birthday shipped as cabin boy
or a South Sea trader. After serving a
passage on her and arother ship I was
given the berth of pj^ond mate on the
old Richmond. It was at Point de Gall.

a number of ports enlisting men. When I
learred of the purposes of the expedition
end the opportunities for one of my ad

and there. I went in as an ordinary
eallor. and never rose higher, as 1 did
not intend to stay in the navy after the
purposes of the expedition had been ac
complished. There were over <00 men
in the crew of the Mississippi, the most
mixed crowd I ever pot into.
"We headed directly for Hongkong,

ten ships. Including several /storeships.

of their crimes. But I am getting ahead
of my story. /
"During the time we lay at Hongkong
there was considerable amusement. After,
when the weather and our duties permit-
ted, we indulged in boat-races between
our ships and the Knglish. I had the
distinction of King a member of a crew
that won the championship from all our
other ships and tho%o of the English. I
was always fond of rowing, and it was
throug my ability to handle the oars well
that I was picked as one of the twelve In
the crew of Perry's barge. My youth and
activity won me the place in the crews as
signed to 'pirate chasing."
"This Government chartered a 30-to:i
steamer named Queen. Captain Preble
and a crew of fifty were assigned to her.
I .was one of the fortunate ones. The
Queen was so small that she could run
in all the shallow bays and rivers after
the piratical junks. It was our first voy
age, I think, in the little craft that we
had our first encounter with the Chinese.
It was while, on a cruise from Maco to
Hongkong, and while passing a little
island, that we were surprised by the
pirates. It was in the early afternoon, as
we were leisurely steaming past this
island, that some of the friendly Chinese
came out to us in boats and warned us
against the nest of pirates on the island.
Their warning was not understood by any
ol us except the Chinese pilot, who, when
Captain Preble gave the command to
steam in shore, took refuge under a
bench. We had to threaten him with his
life before he would direct the course of
the steamer. We landed a part'" which
was immediatfly fired upon by the pi
rates, who outnumbered us ten times.
Seeing we could do nothing against such

re-enforrcme:its. Here is where I had my
first experience with a shot. I was work
ing on one of the forward guns, when a
solid shot fell on the deck within a yard
or two of me. I attempted to pick it up.
intending to heave it overboard. I droppcl
it qu'eker than wink, and you can bet I
never touched another hot one. I did not
use my hands for some time afterward.
As soon as re-enforcements were secured
ihe town was stormed, a number of pris
oners captured and several guns taken.
"A few weeks I3ter we received word
that an English ship, with crew and pas
sengers, had been taken by pirates, among
<l:e latter a French actress. They were
raid to be at St. Johns Island.
"We formed a joint expedition with the
Knglish and sraiied for the island. Here
Â¦we had enough experience? to make a vol
ume by itself. The landing party was
under the command of Lieutenant Ran
<!o!f. one of our newest officers. I don't
know where he received his experience,
but certainly never with sailor?. The fort
on the islaml was booming at us as we
were landing by the boatful, and thera
was general excitement and hurry. As
soon as we pot ashore the lieutenant or
dered us to fall in and march as an in
fantry company. The men rebelled. They
dropped their cannon and left them to be
hauled by the marines. In an instant we
were all off for the post, yelling like In
dians. We stormed the fort and cap
tured over sixty prisoners. Of course our
broach of discipline was reported to
Perry, who, though showing no signs of
encouraging such methods, refused to
punish us. Ho knew our wild spirit and
made allowance for us. As I said, we
captured the fort and relieved the im
prisoned crew and passengers of the fated
Englishman.
"It was while carrying off the spoils of
war that I came as near losing my life as
I ever want to. "Scotty* Adams of the
Macedonian and I were carryirg a gun
carriage through the streets of the cap
tured town when we were ambushed. A
shot took Adams' head clean off his body
and I felt spattered brains on my back.
At that grewpome sight I felt faint and
had hard work to make tho rest of our
column. The shot was so unexpected that
Adams" death called for an investigation.
I was questioned and my pistols exam
ined. They believed we had words and I
had killed him. I was exonerated from all
blame, however.
"After one or two similar engagements
I was taken sick and sent home. I 'was
so incapacitated that thoy.hn'-w I would
not be any more good on that cruise. I
was transferred from the Mississippi to
the Powhattan, and from -her to the War
ren, which discharged mq at Mare Island
Navy-yard in 1855.
"The history of that expedition has
often been told, and the love of the sail
ors for Commodore Perry has also been
written, so that I can only add my mite
to his memory. He was loved and cher
ished by us all. There was no air of
haughtiness about him. His motto was,
â¢The sailor first, the officer afterward.' "
SHE had big. wondering black eyes
and long ringlets that were black
too, and shining, like the wing of a
raven; her face was beautiful and
oval and her figure lithe and young. She
wore oddly draped old gowns and looked
as If she might have stepped out of one of
the ancient portrait frames that hung in
the hall of the old Virginia home. Her
name was Elizabeth Thompson, and she
was 17.
Now her name Is Elizabeth Lord and she
Is 62: not lithe and young, but pitiably
bent and old. She wears a twisted, queer
old black hat and a somber, old brown
shawl. She goes about every day frdm
one place to another upon a very queer
quest Indeed.
Every one around the Middle Mission
knows herâ the crazy old woman who is
looking for her husband.
"Is R. C.'Lord here?" she will ask as
she pokes her head in at the door of a
corner grocery. And when they tell her
that he is not she will further satisfy her
self of the fact by going through to tha
back and taking a peep In at the saloon.
Then she smiles and goes away. And her
way is a very regular one. She goes to the
same houses and business places every
day, and once a week she walks all the
way down to the Battery street postofflce
to ask If there Is a letter for Mrs. R. C.
Ix)rd from her husband. The new post
offlce Is one of the places on her visiting
list, and the men at work on the big slabs
of granite in the yard of the building havÂ«
grown to expect her.
"Howdedo?" she cays, gree/Ing them
with a smile. "Have you seen Mr. Lord
about here to-day?"
And some of the men will take off their
hats and scratch their heads thoughtfully,
saying that they don't believe they have,
which is very true, for Robert C. Lord has
not been seen or heard of these thirty long
years.
Thirty yearsâ that is a long time: a long,
long time for a woman to be searching for
her husband. But Elizabeth Lord has
sought every day since he deserted her.
"Robert went away." she says. "He
went away Just after breakfast, and he
has not come home, so I thought I would
run around here and see if I could find
him. He always loved me in the old days,
did Robert. He thought the world of his
Bess, an' he wouldn't stay away. Oh, no;
he will come back."
Sometimes she imagines he has already
returned, and she will never sit down to
her dinner at her sister's home In the Mis
sion without first going to the sitting-room
door and calling, "Robert. Robert, dinner
is ready; come on, dear."
In the old days "on the Virginia farm,
when Bessie Thompson was the beautiful
daughter of a proud old Southern familyr
Robert Lord came down from the North
and sought her out. "When the sun's rays
shone slanting across the tobacco fields
she would wander with him down to the
old road gate and while the birds hushed
their twitters in the trees Robert Lord
would tell her many things that were
pleasant to hear.
"And, Bessie, rogue." he would say, "we
will go out 'West an' we'll make a home
. . i
for ourselves in the new country. Ton
must na' say me no, for you've tangle. l
up my heart among: your ringlets. Boss,
an* I canna' get It free again."
"An* would you. If you could?" It was
the roguish Bess that asked, and ho must
have answered the catechising to her sat
isfaction, for they came away Into tha
new country and the home-making* te
gan.
But It did not last. Robert grew tired
of toiling, and perhaps he grew tired of
his wife, for he took to dissipating, and
there 'were nights when Bessie sat up far
Into the night, alone by her fireside, rock-
Ing slowly In the big rocking-chair, wait
ing. And Robert found out how to win
and lose money by playing reckless
games, bo the little home dwindled aw iy
and one day tha Sheriff cams and took

When he did not return, and tha days
kept going by, Bessie began to act queer

filled with tears. One. day they noticed
that she had lost the worried look. It
was when she came In ona moxnlca

"I am going down to thÂ« grocery ansl

of the house. Since then. shÂ« has neve?

always coming back.

nounces. "Tha men Â«ay they hava not
seen him. The furniture man says ha was
there yesternight, but he has not baezx
there to-day. I came homo to lunch, then
I will go again."
She looks for him In Queer placesâ cf i
cellars, dingy basements, sometimes In
back yards and up in tho lofts of th*
Mission Junk shops. If there Is any open
in? left In the fences, or a side gate ajar,
she walks in, peering around, and If azy
one appears she asks Innocently. "Havo

In vain does her sister persuade. Sha

While Tinka had been speaking the two
travelers had heard for some moments
childish lisping and laughter in the next
room, separated from tnetn by a simple
sliding partition. The sound of little hur
rying footsteps running across the floor
and pursuing one another was heard.
Then the door suddenly opened and the
little rosy, curl surrounded faces of Car
ola and Ida appeared, emerging from the
long nightgowns held up by their little
hands. They rushed Into the room, cry
ing "Mamma! Mamma!" and stopped,
rendered dumb by the sight of two
strangers.
"These are my children," said Tinka.
quietly. "That js Carola,, the elder, and
this one is Ida."
Pirnltz and Frederique kissed them. Ida
looked at the two women fixedly. Carola,
pouting, hid her face In the white sleeves
of her nightgown. Tinka led them away,
saying, "Good-night."
And she went out. Then Frederique,
heart-broken, fell into an armchair, rest
ing her head upon Plrnttz's bosom.
"Romalne! Komalne!" she sobbed. "I
have killed Lea. But for me she would
have been Georg's wife long ago, and none
of all the troubles that have broken her
health would have happened!"
The days passedâ thosa days of waiting
that petrify the life of an entire house
hold around the bedside of an lnralid. No
outbreak of affection reconciled Lea with
Frederique and Pirnitz. After having
longed for them she appeared to have lost
all interest In their presence, as though
they were there by chance without her
having asked for them. When they came
to sit near her bed Lea became silent and
barely responded to their questions. She
fixed her eye*, blazing with fever, upon
them as though she would make them un
derstand without speaking the eecrat re
proaches she made to them.
Very soon she no longer went beyond
the narrow limits of her bedroom and par
lor. Her feebleness even prevented her
taking the afternoon promenades. From
the moment that she was thus conflne.1 to
the house ?he insisted upon Georg btlng
near her day and night, and abandoned
little by little any attempt at feminine co
quetry before nim. She let him see her
In all the wretchedness of her physical
collapse. She even dwelt upon it with In
sistence.
When L,ea desired to alone, or after
she had retired, watched by Edith, in the
evening Georg would take refuge with
Tinka. 'More than ever he treasured the
aftection of this sister of his. body and
soulâ an affection "that had accompanied
him throughout his life from infancy, an
affection that was more than fraternal
and perfectly pure! i
"It is not death that is dreadful, Tln-
Ua " he said to her. "Death is the repose
and Immobility that we admire and love
in surrounding things. Death, in its de
flnltivtr tranqullity. Is as beautiful as life
in its action and movement. That which
is frightful, hateful, is the struggling of
life with death. It is the perishing of ex
istence, convulsed with shocks, embittered
with rancor, as it changes into the repose
that it refuses to accept."
One morning at the beginning of Octo
ber, just at the moment that h.dlth hav
ing* put the room in order, was going to
summon Georg. as usual. Lea drew her to
ward her and said:
"Edith. I want you to write to Freder
ique and Pirnltz:' 1
* "Oh! dearest/' returned Edith, "I will
do it wlth r pleasure. I should have writ
ten long ago had I not feared to displease
you It seemed to me that I had no right
to interfere. What shall I say to them?"
"Tell them that If they still love me
they 'will leave everything and come to
me. Otherwise"â her voice died away in
htir throat for an instantâ "otherwise they
will never seo me again." Â¦"
Lea had thought over this project for
more than a week. She had thought of
it when in her pony carriage, when sit
ting upon the benches in the promenade,
when in the. yellow parlor conversing with
the surrounding objects. .
Tinka undertook to warn Frederique,
while Edith wrote to Pirnltz and told her
In her precise manner, sprinkled with
fiious quotations, the lamentable wander
ngÂ» of Lea in London. Tinka described
very sincerely the hopeless condition of
the invalid. Â¦ Â¦'/Â¦Â¦Â¦ 'â¢'<Â¦'-'Â¦:
"We aro heart-broken, she said. "It
is now only a Question of days. Lea was
right to tell Edith to urge you to hasten
if you wish to see her again. I do not
know where this letter will find you, or
from what useful and generous work it
will ,tear you, but you must comeâ you
must!"
They arrived one evening, long after
nightfall. At the moment when they got
out of .the carriage .before the Morley
dwelling groups of women in white
dresses, covered with cloaks, and men In
smoking jackets were ascending Park
Hill road, along the coast, and chatting
precious and rare to her. as though a lit
tle of her slowly fading Individuality re
mained attached to their Iifc!es3 furmri.
She passed noiselessly from 0110 article to
another, examining and touching them.
I, It tie. by little she understood them, dl-
vlned their history and how they borÂ«
witness of the life of an entire family,
one that was anterior to her arrival there,
one that was continuing around her and
that would live when she had disappeared.
Red curtains had been hung, in addition
to the window blinds in tho bedroom, so
that the sunlight would not wake the in
valid too early, for it Wits in the morn-
Ing that she slept the best. Even when
raised they Imparted a pink tint to the
light, aridÂ£brightehed with a little glow
the white paper, with its largo pale iris.
Her familiar surroundings were imprinted
upon Idea's memory; the iron bed where
she slept, with its line sheets and the two
little oblong pillows with starched lace
edging showing under the lace-covered
counterpane: Edith's little corch by Its
side was folded un in the daytime and
covered with a rug. Lea would stop to
contemplate on the toilet table the two ;
china porcelain bowls and tho big decan
ter-shaped water jugs, also of china
porcelain. She imagined that the captain
had brought them back with himâ before
he 'had become the active maniac he was
to-dayâ when he wan a young, joyous,
brisht-eyed and ruddy s comnlexioned (
sailor, w ; hcn he enjoyed life and loved.
In the parlor the lisht. lemon-colored
wall paper, with a deep frieze at the ceil
ing, imparted a little cheerfulness to the
room, even at sunsets Three pictures
hung on the v.ollsâ 1 lithographed repre
sentation of .1 child blowing soap bubbles,
the well-known engraving of the English
captains playing ninepins while awaiting
the arrival of the Spanish Armada, and
two dancing odalisques entitled "Flowers
of the East."
Upon the little desk in the corner of
the window on the right before which
Tinka usually sat a blue morocvo leather
ca-lendar. with changeable leaves, was
placed near the blotting paper and pens.
To-day it indicated "Sunday, 7th Novem
ber." without doubt thi; T th of November
of a year that had long since elapsed.
There was also a date book for invitations
upon the desk, but the Morley family had
evidently soon given up this species of
social bookkeeping, for it contained only
ten or a dozen dates.
A third article upon the same desk
often occupied Lea's thoughts during her
moments of voluntary solitude. It was a
little stereoscope of rather primitive form,
accompanied by a red plush box tilled
with views of Italy and Devonshire and ,
also some Interior scenes, which all ap
peared to date from .1 quarter of a cen
tury before, for they were yellowed by
age and the people represented in them
were dressed according to an ancient fash
ion. Several were enhanced by a Uttle .
adroit coloring. One showed two girls slt-

l.ea lived in the society of the liliputian
furniture, the Japanese album, the carved
wood Tower of Habel, the stereoscope, the
pictures und porcelains. This history of
living and dead people related by the
objects around her in articles not her own
âarticles that had received her with in
difference, as they had already received
so many passing visitorsâ Irritated and
yet attracted her. But she waa partic
ularly interested in an oblong book which
she found upon one of the three-legged
tables, containing a number of old views
of Torquay. They were very good wood
engravings, and represented the port, the
towii, the favorite promenades, at an
epoch when Torquay was not as extensive
as it i3 to-day. The women were dressed
in wide, spreading skirts and polonaises,
the men In nantceen trousers, narrow
wrxistcd morning coats and rather pointed
high silk hats. And even at that epoch
the little pony carriages were pictured In
the engravings, and in the carriages the
sad pale face that seemed to be the mere
reproduction of those, to be seen dally In
Torquay at that moment. Yet the book
was dated 1S6S. â¢ . ;
"Thirty years!" thought Lea. "Where
are the people that the artist took for
models when he drew those Invalids In the
pony carriages?"
Thirty years! The dreadful certainty
that in"thirty years she would be not even
the absentee whose loss Is mourned, but a
poor, forgotten dead creature, engulfed In
eternity beyond which the lives of others
rejoin and continue, filled her heart with
melancholy.
"Thirty years! Others of 127 age to
day will still be living In tnlrty years.
And I? And I?"
She cast an eager glance around the
room and upon the watery landscape
which she saw from the window. Her
desire became keener to see the light, the
rocfts, the sea, the trees, even the humble
objects around her.
The weather began to Improve slowly In
the early days of October. Pale rays of
sunlight emerged through the drapery of
clouds. The sea changed in color, .was
more stormy, but of a deeper blue. Finally
a day dawned with scarcely a trace of
mist. And then the sun came out with. its
full strength, drying the pavement of the

_)\ they had endured; they under

the fhort cycle of their youth all that

yearsâ of centuries, perhaps â in order to
elevate themselves to the conquest of
KjUii! r:phts. They were mature with all

ignorance of love, in a sort of shy purity,
they had known the heroism of con
science and of Immolation to Idea. Sepa
r&tior. had made them suffer in their flesh
and blood. They had undergone cruel,
satiable desire and had quivered with re
beliton. They had crossed like a desert
the period of hostile solitude predicted by
the r?et. in which the two sexes should
repaid each other from a distance with
ar.ger.
Then, breaking her bonds one day, the
Woman had rejoined the Man. the Bride
had ascended her Mount Calvary toward
the Bridegroom. And when she fell in his
arms she was bruised and bleeding with
the asperities of the road. For some time
they had not recognized one another, but
finally to-day they were face to face, free
and conscious of their freedom. For the
Jirst time they understood the lesson and
the symbol contained in their own past.
They read in each oth-.-r's eyes the will to'
yield willingly and to conquer without
violence. They were perfectly equal, in
the liberty of the legendary I'aradise. thtj
only Man and only Woman in nature.
Their lips, which had karned by heredity
to kiss, were united as upon that evening
at Richmond. Kul to their astonishment,
instead of the troubled joy that had then
overwhelmed them, they tasted the peace
of cool, pure water qudichinp their thirst.
They kissed and then :Â«garded each Other.
They locked aroun<i the spot that had
Â¦witnessed their transfigurationâ the rocky
terrace with its rulntu chapel, the Circle
of the flower covlred vault, and through
the crumbling Â¦window tho vast sea which
the mid<iay turned into a sheet of liquid
copper.

He pointed to the horizon. The livid

were ri.sirr? in its place. All the west was
already invaded by them. In these supÂ«r

sought, as always, the forms of reality.
A dream city, more resplendent than any
architectural construction. nu\t stood out
against the glowing sky and displayed
the orb of its domes, the shafts of its
columns. Its naves and the pediments of
its temples. Avenues converged toward
triumphal arches. The galleries of the
palaces were prolonged beyond hirge
porticos. The two lovers pressed cheek

and bclteld with rapture this idea; city
grown iiuo tteing at the very moment
when they themselves felt as though old
Fca!(Â«, s:>lit asunder, fell from them ami
crumbled into dust at their feet. And
the city was not born at sunset of even-
Ing's lading purple, but at noon â was
built In sunlight. Hallucinated by too
much light Georg and Lea soon perceived
nothing save that expanse of shimmering
copper and the city which seemed to be
its pigaritic offspring. Distance was abol
ished in the mirage reflected from sjiy
and sea. They seemed to live among the
clouds grouped j n montunenta. Their
eyes, â¢rhich closed fatigued with the liÂ»;ht.

L.ong after Gvorg h:nl pushed on* the
boat from the rock with the oar and he
and l>?a were vailing again toward the
Coast, they were still benumbed by their
heroic end voluptuous dream. \Vas it
li'-ar midnight or midday'.' They <lid not
know and the sun no longer gave them
any indication. The banked up clouds
â¢which had formerly imaged a city in tho
wrest had melted ;iway slowly, reduced to
a nn of gloomy dust little by Uttle,
covering the em ire surface of the sky.
Other clouds were now rising slowly, like
Shreds <-f black crape, dotted with masses
of livid nn,ike lower down toward tho
horizon. They were all alike and seemed
Ftill undecided jis to the point where they
would unite. Some were motionless, ap
parently lijctd to the celestial vault;
others glided ainns rapidly. ;is though an
imated with Independent life. The wave

"Make haste, I pray you!" cried Georg,

"But we shall never have time to rea h

replied, still cheerful and enjoying hi*
anxious KTlp as though it dad been a
caresa,
"We arc not going to Torquay. \W will
take shelter in Hissies cottage and let the

At last they reached the crest of tlie

[ootEteva. Georg sheltered Lea aÂ« v.cll us
he eoui<l. She only laughed, aayln**:
"Uon't br- iiXr.iitl. I feel <juile well."
At last the door opened, and an old
woman in a black cashmere dress and
black bonnet examined tho two travelers
v.itj; a vacant Â«-ye. Her face was curiously
Â¦wrinkled, f.rhon !iuc-<1 and livid. She woke
up suddenly when she recopnized Georjj.
"Oh! good afternoon, sir. Come in
Â«;ukkly. What are you doing out Jn such
weather?"
"Have vou n fire nr.fl some Tr.irm tea.
Mother Kate?'" aFkÂ«xl Georg. "This lady
Is cold and wot."
"It is Sunday to-day, nnd we have no
fir<- in the kitchen, Imt I can light one."
"All risht. l<ut make haste. But until
5'ou have lit tho fire you must lend some
r'.othos to my wife and let her lie down
v:j>on your bed. well covered."
"Certainly, sir." said the old woman.
Fho hurried away, rather agitated. turn-
Ins comically from right to left, muttering
B few unintelligible words with which she
probably assisted her falling thought!*.
She took a brown cloth skirt and a shawl
cut of a soMd mahogany wardrobe. They
were card ally wrapped up in a news'
paper, odorous of thyme. With Goorg's
help I>ea jrayly unfastened her shoes,
dress and bodice. An old-fashioned can
ojiy bod, which certainly dated from the
:finÂ» of Cueen Anne, filled the end of the
littl* parlor. I^a lay down on this hard
ouch, witli a qu!lt<"il coverlet over her
foot. She obeyed Georg in everything,
anxious above al) not to alarm him. al
though she felt some little repugnance for
these articles, vrliich. in spite of their
scrupulous cleanliness, emitted a strange,
pcrsistr-nt odor r,f old age.
"Where is Bissie?" asked Georg.
"Ovrr yonder." replied the old woman.
Indicating the direction with a mavement
<>t her head. "He has gone to see about
sorac work he will have to do to-morrow.
It is for a young foreigner. This is the
season when work begins again. But he
will soon be here again."
She spoke with u vague smile that
starred Her face with deep wrinkles. She
then went Into the kitchen to light the
lire, and from time to time they saw her
reappear, bringing one by one in her trem
bling hands the objects necessary for tho
tea. She laid them on the round table,
covered with a rough white cloth. The
service was of metal, of a rounded, un
common form.
Georg still held Lea's fingers, remarking
with anxiety the fever burning in her
eyc-s. She was Hushed under her chestnut
hair, which seamed brown in the half
Bloom of the room. But her pulse beat
regularly and her skin was cool and fresh.
"1 haw a strong inclination to leave you
In the care of the old woman," said
Ueorg, "and to run to Torquay, or rather
to Saint Mary's Church, which is quite
near. 1 can get a closed carriage to take
us back home."
"Oh. no. Uon't leave me!" she said,
clutching Gecrg's Land. "We are very
comfortable here. You can send Bissle
tor a carriage when he cames in."
He decided that she was right. The rain
was pouring down outside now in torrents.
Through the sliding window, with Its cro
cheted curtains, they saw the rose bushes
and fuchsias waving wildly in the nar
row garden under the gusts of wind. Kate
was very slow. They could hear her heavy
footsteps in the kitchen and the hoarse
sound of her aged voice. Suddenly a
spasm convulsed Lea's features and her
fingers gripped those of her husband. A.
shudder shook her frame in spite of her
efforts to resist it. Her teeth chattered
for several seconds and her limbs
trembled. Georg, in terror, put his arm
around his Â¦wife's waist and called:
"Kate! Kate! Make haste, for the love
of heaven! Quick! Bring me some tea!
Some warm tea!"
But the old woman. In spite of her ef
forts to make baste, could not finish her
preparations before the paroxysm had
passed. Still quivering, and with a few
drops of sweat at her temples. Lea drank
two eupa of the hot liquid in rapid suc
cession.
"1 feel better," she said. "Oh! much
bettor. Don't be alarmed. 1 pray you."
And to reassure Georg she said, jok
ingly:
â¢â¢oreat heavens! how bad this tea is!
It smells old. like everything in the
house."
At that moment the door opened and
Bissie came in. dressed in a suit of broad
cloth. He stopped for a moment at the
sight of Lea lying on the bed with Georg
sitting beside her, but did not speak.
"Here is Mr. Georg and his wife. They
were caucht in the rain, Bissle,** said
Kate. "You must go for a carriage to
take them back to Torquay."
"All right." said the old man.
"Run quick, Bissie," cried Geor.<.
"Here is a sovereip-n."
"Shall I hire the carriage at Samson's,
near St. Mary's Church?" asked the man.
"Hire It where you like, so long as you
bring it quickly, at no matter what
price."
When he had left at a quick pace Lea
felt nor momentary indisposition passing
over. She amused herself with Gt-org in
examining her surroundings, which were
so curious in their decrepitude, and in
looking at the numerous little frames dec
orating the walls like ex-votoa in a
chapel, shiny daguerreotypes, portraits of
reigning sovereigns out out of illustrated
papers, and. above all, a quantity of pho
tographs of tombstones.
Then gradually, in the warmth of the
little room, tho young woman fell asleep.
Geors watched over her. overwhelmed
by an Indefinable anxiety. He clasped
the little hand, which became moist with
perspiration. A fairly long period
passed thus. The old woman came in to
clear the taÂ»>Ie. but Georg made a siffn for
her to remain in the kitchen and not to
disturb Lea'fl repose. The v.-ind no longer
swept over the fuchsias in the garden
with th*Â» same violence. The tempest
Was <!y!ni; away in a dense, continuous
rain. \"Jeorg held Lea's hand, and this
little thine: of flesh and blood, so pale and
blue veined, filled him with a profound
trnderners. He touched it with his lips,
wished that all his strength might pene
trate the slender blue veins and tho pulp
of tho flesh. His love, like all great pas
sio:is. was increased by possession. |The
happiness of beinc Lea"Â« husband now
jjppeared so prodigious that he felt, as a
sort of reaction, a dreadful anguish for
tho future.
Lea uttered a few Indistinct words in
her sleep, then awoke and smiled at
"I am cuite well." she said again, pre
occupied by the desire to reassure him.
They conversed quietly, more at ease in
their mind?.
"Tho eld woman said that Bissle had
ponp to Â«ee about some wrt for a young
foreigner." said Lea. "What is BIssle's
work?"
CJeorg hesitated.
"He is the gravedljrscr at St. Mary s
Church."
Lea t>id not appear alarmed by the re
ply, but she immediately began to speak
of' something els=rÂ». and asked Georg to
draw Ihe curtain back from the window
"to Kt what kind of weather it was."
The o!d woman appeared at the door of
the room. ... , ,
â¢â¢I can hear the carriage, she said.
And the wheels were heard grin-ling un
der them the gravel in the road. The
garden eate squeaked on its hinges. Then
Lea. putting her Lipa close to Oeorg's ear.
said to him in a tender. F~rene voice: â
"If I <1Ip here 1 do not wish to be burle .
at Torquay or at St. Mary's Church. 1
want to sleep where we were upon our
roÂ«-k before the sea!"

cretly certain that she would really see it
tome day; whereas to-day the vision
glowed In the past and was slowly effaced
by the mist and rain. Every time Leas

Blowly dissolving her dream.
All "the inhabitants of Dartmoor House
served her with devotionâ all from Georg
to little Lizzie and Tinka's fair-haired
children. She obeyed the prescriptions of
the doctor and Edith, was very docile,
went to bed. rose, changed her linen, ate,
took htr potion meekly. But she ac
cepted all their care through gratitude
and to avoid giving pain to those around,
her. Without being able to explain to
herself the reason for her despair, she
no longer believed in the possibility of a
cure frcm the day spent on Glider Rock.
And to hide this certainty from Edith.
Tinka and. above all. from Georg fatigued
her intolerably. She sometimes begged
thr.m to spare her, to leave her alone in
trie two rooms on the first floor, her bed
room and the yellow drawing room, tell
ing them that she was sleepy. But she
really longed to be free from the task of
composing her visage and of watching
over her words and gestures. To be alone!
To be able to think of herself with the
absolute egotism of condemned patients!
To look at herself In the mirror! To trace
the ravages of her illness, to contemplate
her melancholy lot face to face! To weep
over her fate freely like the daughter of
Jephtha. like Iphlgenia. like all young
creatures sentenced to a cruel end!
She knew that her end was near. She
knew that It was necessary not only in
consequence of her present physical col
lapse, but also as part of the natural order
of things. The superhuman moment spent
upon Gilder Rock could not be renewed.
Two beings who had been united in such
ecstatic rapture could no longer live like
ordinary husband and wife to mingle their
conjugal affection with the routine of
commonplace reality. Indisputable evi
dence anirmed this law. and in her secret
heart she accepted It. though she felt a
bitter joy In bewailing her destiny.
She wandered about that domain of a
dying woman, the two rooms on the first
floor where she was* confined by her ill
ness and the Inclemency of the weather.
She examined everything with eager, min
ute attention, just as one tastes with a
more attentive palate the last drops of
some precious liquor. Did she love or hate
these objects? She could not have an
swered, but she regarded them passion
ately. "They are the last things I shall
see," she thought, and tte idea made them
ting at the piano, their young and pretty
mother standing beside them In a brown
silk skirt expanded by the crinoline and
a low-necked bodice, with lace trimming
and bordered by black velvet. The tallest
of the two girls was dressed In blue and
the other in violet. They were represent
ed in a drawing-room with upholstered
furniture of a very decided style. Lea was

with the discreet gayety of the English
when enjoying themselves. There was a
ball at the Imperial Hotel, close to Dart
moor House, and the healthy population
of Torquay was going to it. There were
even several closed landaus following the
crowd, and by the light of their lamps
could be seen the pale countenance of
some consumptive who had wished to
participate In the fete. Frederique and
Pirnltz were received by Tinka and Georg
In the yellow drawing room and were led
to Lea's bedroom almost immediately.
The interview was not very tragical in
appearance. Lea was lying upon her bed,
her arms and nhoulders covered with an
elegant morning robe, which she had
made formerly at the CocVIngtons'. The
fever gave a touch of color to her face.
The fleshlessness of her body was only
revealed by the thinness of her hand3
and the stiff folds and hollows made by
the sheets and counterpane upon her legs.
The shaded lamp had been drawn back
behind the bed. so that the light might
not be so glaring. A few commonplace
phrases were exchanged after Frederique
and Plrnitz had kissed the invalid's fore
head, moistening their lips with the beads
of perspiration at the roots of her hair.
Their words betrayed nothing of the pro
found distress of thir eouls; in fact, they
seemed to seek to dissimulate it. Lea told
them that she did not suffer very much,
that she hoped to pass a calm night, for
she already felt a desire to sleep. She
asked the travelers If they had had a
pleasant voyage, and they replied that the
whole voyage had been very agreeable,
and that they were not fatigued In the
least. Then there was a silence, and
again Pirnits antt Frederique kissed Lea's
moist forehead, wished her good night
and retired to their room.
It was Georg's room usually. He had
given it up to the newcomers, and had es
tablished himself in a little room nearby.
Tinka remained with them for some little
time. Pressed by Frederique with ques
tions, she gave them more details than
her letter had contained. Big tears welled
up In her pale green eyes as she told them
all the story, In her even, penetrating
voice of a tiny prophetess.
"We have seen that dear plant return
to life under the sunlight here, and be
come more beautiful than ever, even in
the time of our residence in Apple Tree
Yard. When she was married to Georg
she became less anxious, and we all be
gan to hope. Then, after an excursion
that they made together to Gilder Rock.
Lea had a relapse. It is klllinz me. I
"Look! Look at my arms! Look at my
bosom!"
A strange loving ardor overwhelmed her.
She drew her husband's heM\ against her
bosom and covered it with kisses and ca
resses. The couple dwelt alone during her
dying agony. Georg lived only for Lea
and no longer left her. He slept in tho
yellow parlor upon a sofa and ran to her
In the night at the slightest sound of a
cough, at the faintest whisper of his
name. Mysteriously, without allowing any
one to hear their conversation, they whis
pered their terrible despair, owned to each
other all their desires, told of all they
would have made of life if life had been
spared them. And neither sought to de
ceive the other. They did not say: "We
will do this. We will go there," but "We
would have done this; we w^uld have gone
there."
Every one respected their solitude. Tho
house was as silent as though a death,
watch were being kept. With the excep
tion of Georg and Lea. the inhabitants of
Dartmoor House were brought closer to
gether; their souls mingled gradually ami
penetrated one another. Frederique
learned to know Edith better, for in Lon
don she had been formerly rather Lea's
companion and friend. They conversed
about a variety of subjects. Edith ex
plained her plans. She was going to
Queensland to join a flourishing feminist
colony in Hopetown. She exhibited somo
letters that she had received from this
colony, describing the curious society that
had been formed in that part of the worM
by some hardly innovators upon a basis
of economical and political equality, and
with a genuine equality of love between
the two sexes. Fredertque. after so many
rebuffs, was disgusted" with wornout so
cial order, as it Is now constituted in Eu
rope: disgusted with a society so antag
onistic to all innovation, and longed to>
say to Edith: "Take me with you as sooa
as the inevitable has been accomplished I
I pray you, take me with you. I will
go!" But the thought that Pirnltz
dreamed of recommencing the work la
Paris, in disdainful and hostile Paris, a till
retained her.
Pirnltz, exercising her magnetic fasci
nation upon those who scarcely knew her,
Boon became the moral center of Dart
moor House. Carola and Ida simply wor
shiped her and implored her continuously
to tell them tales. The apostle talked to*
them without tiring for hours without
wearying them, and already she began to>
have an Influence upon the rather Intract
able character of the younger.
She gently reproached Professor Hoedel
with torturing Innocent creatures, "whoss
life in which to rejoice in the air and sun
light Is so short, and you suddenly hurl
them from life to death, you make of
them ugly little corpses pinned upon, white*
paper.
Worthy Hoedel. divided between his
passion for oclence and the desire not to
read a reproach in the prophetic eyes
of the apostle, now hid his studious weak
ness and devoted himself to botany. HÂ»
passed proudly before Plrnitz. glancing
at her almost affectionately with his big 1
blue eyes behind the gold rimmed specta
cles, and would say, tapping his zinc box;
"Only flowers, mademoiselle! No in
sects: Only flowers: nothing else."
The captain. Lizzie and lethargic Mrs.
Morley also submitted to Pirnitz's influ
ence. They all yielded to an imperious
desire to please her, to be noticed and.
approved by her. The one conquered most
completely was Tinka. She had never
seen Pirnitz before that tragical period.
Her meeting with the apostle gave her a.
violent shock that was intensified by her
delicate organization and artistic spirit.
More curious about the soul than about
picturesque forms. Justus Hoedel's wlfÂ»
had never before met one of such rarity
Â«nd beauty. From that moment she aban
doned all work and hid away In a drawer
the novel she had commenced. She no>
longer left Pirnltz. but followed her. as a.
faithful dog follows Its master,' listening
to her conversation. Romalne, - realizing
that the Hoedel household had been re
established In its most satisfactory order
did not seek to influence Tinka, who. so
to speak, seemed to bathe in h*r presence.
At the same time her literary Instinct
compelled her to study and analyze tho
tpostle's personality, which was indis
pensable for the new story that she wa-t
planning. She said candidly to Firr.itz.
with the air of an inspired child that
made her so captivating:
"\ou could not help coming here and I
had to know you so that my boolc might
be true. I am not surprised that you
came. When I am writing the characters
whom I describe have always appeared
before when they were necessary fur my
book."
Thus in the household In Park Hill road,
where Lea, watched ovrr by Georg, was
Blowly descending the slope of death, lif.i
also slowly contracted mysterious soul al
liances.
As Lea could but rarely leave her bed.
the double folding door was kept widu
open thenceforth, and In the daytime the
bed was drawn near thus door. Lyins
there Lea could then set- one o* the sit
ting-room windows, the one in the right.
hand corner. She made them raise thÂ«
blinds and then couid porcc-ive the sky
and divined where was the sea.
On the tith of October Â¦ sudden alarm
shocked the residents of Dartmoor House
After a night of suffocation Lea fell into a
state of prostration that matJe Dr. Hryca
presage a fatal termination very quickly.
Frederique. approved in her decision by
Plrnitz and Edith, asked the Catholio
priest who had married Lea to come at
once. The invalid received the last sacra
ment with recovering consciousness, al
though with drooping eyelids. She replied
at certain moments to the prayers that
she appeared to hear vaguely. Her lip*
uttered twice "Amen." and she made an
effort to cross herself.
Toward noon on the same day she awoko
and declared she felt better. Nothing was
said of the sacrament she had received,
by those around her or by her. The after
noon, evening and night were fairly calm.
The following day was even better, and
during the next few days her feebleness
merely increased without any paroxysms.
Lea now took nothing but a little jelly, a.
spoonful at a time, and even that Edith,
had to induce her to take with a thousand
ruses. She spoke but little, slumbered and
insisted upon Georg's presence.
On the 14th. about 6 o'clock in the morn
ing, Lizzie Morley rapped at the door off
the room where Frederique and Pirnltz
elept.
"Great heavens! What ia the matter?**
cried Frederique. awakening with a. start.
"Miss Craggs begs that you will como
down as soon as you are dressed. Don't
bo alarmed, there is no change: Mme. Lea.
is. If anything, a little better, but she haa
asked for you."
They dressed hastily. When they en
tered the invalid's room energetic little
Edith had put everything in order. Lea,
was lying in the white bed lean
ing against the lace-edged pillows. Georg,
his visage ravaged by the lack of sleep,
said nothing to the two women, who
stopped over Lea's pale face and kissed
her forehead.
"Good day. Fed!. Good day, Romalne.
Don't be afraid; I am no worse. I called
you because I feel a little stronger. I can
talk to you very easily to-day. Does not
my voice sound as clear as it did ia tha
old times?"
Oeorg turned away. hl3 lips quirerinjr
with emotion under his blond mustache.
Pirnltz bowed smilingly, and Frederique
said:
"Yes. your voice Is very clear th!3 morn
ing, dearest."
As a matter of fact the veil that for so
Ions had deadened and falsified the son
ority of her voice appeared to havfÂ»
cleared away a little. They talked about
indifferent subjects, as usual: but this
time, after a silence, the invalid said
suddenly:
"I should likeâ T should like to hear
about the school. How did the affair
end?"
Then, with infantile impatience, she
added:
"You never speak to me about tho
schoolâ never! And I thought of Daisy
this morning 1 . You never speak to mo
about her. nor about podr G>?rmalne."
It was the first allusion I,e.i had mnda
to the events in Paris. In spite of her
irritated tone they felt that she really
wished to be Informed upon the matter,
and, in obedience to a sign from Freder
ique. Plrnitz replied:
"We did not tell you about cur troubles.
Lea, in order not to f.itljruo and sadden
you. Besides, nothing new has happened
since we left the Hue des Vergers to
gether. The school reopened on the l3t
of October under Mile. Hcurtr.iu'a direc
tion. The administrative council Is pre
sided over by M. Duramberty. -who is as
sisted by Quignonr.ee, Anquctin and
1'Abbe Minot."
"Ah!" said Lea. "M. Durarr.bprty fa
now occupying himself with educational
questions?"
"Yes. and with politics as well. Rem
blart. the Deputy for St. Charlos. la dead,
and Durambcrty will probably be h;3 suc
cessor.**
Lea thought In silence for some time.
Then she looked fixedly at Plrnltz.
"So you make no resistance?" sho said.
"You let men calmly take your place ar.d
sti-a! the fruits of your labors?" . .
"There was nothing else to be done,
dearest." replied Frederique. "Although,
at first I was in/avor of fighting and be
ginnlne a lavrsuit. I had to now to cir
cumstances. ' Our last contract delivered
us into Duramberty's hand so long as
Duramberty was en good terms with tho
Government."
The -Â»ame strange smile curled Lea's
lip?. Her gaze was d'rected alternately
at Frederique and Pirnltz.

women in Terra del Fuego. who could
only supply their infanta with drink in

they learned the lesson from the birds.
Finally, we are told that kissing la an
evidence of atavism and a memorial of
that early stage in our development "dur

According; to Professor Cesare Lom
broso. the distinguished Italian criminolo
gist. kissing is quite a modern practice
and originated in a very curious manner.
The kiss, as a token of affection, was un
known to the old Greeks, and neither in
Homer nor in Hesiod do we find any men
tion of it. Hector did net kiss his An
dromache when he bade her farewell, nei
ther did Paris press his Jips to those of
the beauteous Helen, and Ulysses, who
was more of a cosmopolitan than an/ man
of his day, never dreamed of kissing the
enchanting Circe, and when after Ions
wanderings he returned home to hi3
spouse, Penelope, he satisfied himself with
putting one of his stalwart arms around
her waist" and drawing her to him.
Tho people of Terra del Fuego, says
L,ombroso. have taught civilized nations
the orlglnof the delightful art of kissing.
Drinking vessels are unknown in that
country, and the people, when they are
thirsty, simply He down beside brooks
nhd drink th'e water as it flows by them.
It is evident, however, that infants could
not satisfy their thirst in this primitive
fashion, and therefore their mothers have
for ages supplied them with water 1 by
filling their own mouths first and then let
ting it pass through their lips into the ex
pectant mouths of their little ones. In
Borne places the banks ; of the brooks and
rivers are so, high that water cannot be
obtained in the usual manner and tho
mothers in such places draw It up through
long reeds.
Birds feed their young ones in a simi
lar manner. They first fill their own
mouths with water and then transfer it
to the wide open mouths of the little ones.

20MILES WILL NOT GO
TO CHINA AT PRESENT
. WASHINGTON. July 14.â Lieutenant
General Miles called at the Chinese lega
tion to-day and had a talk with Chinese
Minister Wu. This naturally aroused
comment in connection with the vague
rumors afloat that General Miles ought to
go to China. It was stated later, how
ever, by those In position to be thorough
ly Informed of General Miles' plans, that
the call on Minister Wu was entirely de
void of official significance, and that Gen
eral Miles has no present purpose of go-
Ing to China. The relations between Gen
eral Miles and Minister Wu are friendly
and personal, so that they frequently
meet and exchange Informal greeting?.
It is stated that General Miles has not
asked for service In China, and that such,
a move would not be considered for a
moment under the present circumstances.
At most the army to be placed under for
eign commanders does not exceed 10.000.
and It is pointed out that such, a com
mand would be quite inadequate for a
lieutenant general.
It Is appreciated, however, that the sit
uation may develop at any moment so
that a large army will be required, in
which case General Miles might detor

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN DIEGO. July 14.â A cablegram re
ceived early this morning by Rev. D. Ten
ney greatly relieved a household which
has been full of anxiety for the past
month because of a son shut up In Tlon
tsin. The cable said simply, "Safe: fam
ily coming." The telegram is from C. D.
Tenney. the president of the Imper'al
University of China, and all the advices
which his father had were of an alarming
nature. In a letter written on the 8th of
last month Professor Tenney's wife
wrote: * ."'Â¦->
TVe are In the midst of very exciting times
here. Our foreign settlement at Tientsin la
garrisoned with more than TOO soldiers, who pa
trol the place night and day. The Boxer
movement has suddenly become very alarming.
In the last two weeks the new Lu and Poo
Tiny Fu has been pretty well destroyed. Sta
tions have been burned and bridges torn up to
such an extent on the line between here and
Peking that there has been no train for threr
days. At the University we are especially aux
loue as we- are out of the settlement and rather
isolated. We are constantly warned that ire are
to be attacked, but so far we have been left
In peace. Professors and students are well
armed and take turns In patrolln? the place at
night. The students are anxious to leave and
many of them have left, but my husband feels
that it is most Important to stand by the
place. If It should be abandoned It would
certainly be looted and probably burned down,
and whether the Chinese would rebuild It
would be very uncertain, but if it can be held
intact it will go on no matter what the change
of government.
Professor Tenney was known through
out the Chinese empire as one of its best
educators. He had fourteen years' ex

At this moment the nations of the world
are bending their efforts to reinforce the

NOT OFFICIALLY KNOWN
ST. PETERSBURG. July ll.-It is offi

murder of M. de Giers. the Russian Min
ister at Peking, has been received here.
The Chicago Record's dispatch from St.
Petersburg, giving a story of the alleged
slaughter of the Russian Minister and his
wife at Peking, sent a thrill of horror
through the foreign corps here, none of
whom, however, was able to shed the
slightest light on the subject. At the
Russian embassy the officials were able
to neither confirm nor deny, stating that
thB Government was n"ot In the habit of
forwarding: developments to its diplomatic

quarters there was no knowledge of the

In substance:

for the best. The report of the killing: of
the Russian Minister and his wife was an
other f evere blow, but as to this also Min
ister Wu said that he had absolutely no
news.
MINISTER WU FAILS
TO RECEIVE ANY NEWS
LONDON. July 15. â The only news from China last night
was the following, issued at midnight: "The Foreign
Office has received information from the Consul General at
Shanghai that the whole foreign community from Wenchbw
has beerl safely landed at Shanghai."
As no mention is made of the alleged statement of Sheng,
the Director General of Railways and Telegraphs of China, to
the consuls at Shanghai, announcing the murder of foreigners
in Peking, it is presumed that this story crediting Sheng with
these assertions and announcing that he blamed Prince Tuan for
the attack on the legations is one of the many inventions ema
nating from Shanghai.
According to a dispatch from Berlin the mobilization of
Germany's expeditionary force is being carried on in splendid
fashion. Some 10.000 volunteers and 416 officers have already
been accepter 1. It is announced that the Government contem
plated chartering thirty of the largest vessels belonging to two
of the most important companies, the Bremen and Hamburg
lines, as transports. The expedition is being organized on the
basis of a year's campaign. ;
Alleged Statement of Sheng Re
porting the Murder of Foreigners
at the Chinese Capital Considered
Only as a Shanghai Rumor.
The Administration Officials Have
Practically Abandoned All
Hope for the Americans Who
Were Shut Up in Peking.
Minister Wu, in speaking of Mr. Goodnow's dispatch to
day, said: ''Before passing judgment on that information
I would like to see the text of the proclamation. Perhaps its
language would modify any conclusion we might base upon the
brief message we have. Fortunately there are no foreigners in
those provinces, as they have no treaty ports. The governors
of those provinces are independent of the Viceroys of Central and
Southern China. The latter are fully able to maintain order
within their respective jurisdictions. But I do not believe the
Boxer movement will make such headway in Honan and
Shansi."
It has been the fear of an increase of the revolt that has
led the officials here to advocate an advance on Peking without
unnecessary delay. It has been impossible, perhaps, for a for
ward movement to be made before the arrival of the Japanese
reinforcements, but it is hoped that there will be no further de
lay after these have landed at Taku.
In a mail report received from him to-day, dated June 8.
Goodnow, referring to the conditions in the province of
Kiahgsu. which adjoins Shantung, says: "Accountability for
the agitation prevailing in Northern China at this time cannot
be laid to destitution, as crops in that region are abundant, the
inhabitants prosperous and new machinery and methods of
transportation have not yet thrown any of the people out of
work." He thus intimates that some more serious cause ex
isted for the unsettled conditions.
A dispatch received last week from Consul General Good
now foreshadowed this spreading of the rebellion. He said that
delay in the advance of the allies on Peking would make it dif
ficult to prevent the trouble reaching other provinces and
Southern China.
Spscial Dispatch to the Call. *
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLINGTON HOTEL;
WASHINGTON, July 14.â Practically all hope that
the Americans who were shut up in Peking 1 are alive has
been abandoned by administration officials. While not a word
has been received from Peking that ; can be considered abso
lutely trustworthy, everything that comes from Chinese
sources tends to show that a massacre has taken place. The only
official cablegram received to-day was a short dispatch from
Consul General Goodnow at Shanghai stating that the Gover
nors of Honan and Shansi had issued a proclamation favorable
to the Boxers. This is regarded as very discouraging news, as
it indicates that two of the powerful provincial Governors of
China are inclined to side with the rioters. The province of
Shansi lies directly west of the province of Chihli, in which Pe
king is located, and Honan adjoins it on the south. The two
provinces together have an area of about> 123,000 square miles
and a combined population of about 35,000,000. By the Gov
ernors of such important provinces siding with the Boxers, the
opposition of the allied powers is greatly strengthened.

The Frankfort Zeitung maintains that the

Other leading papers coincide ln this.
Hope for the Boer.
Interest ln the South African -war was
revived in this week, owing to the recent
news. Extras were issued announcing
that the British had mot severe defeats.
The Lokal Anze'.ger to-day magnified the
engagement near Pretoria, claiming that
a British final victory over the Boers is
by no means assured, and the Voerwaerts
to-day says:
"The brave Boer lion Js by no means
dead, even if the number of dogs hunt
ing him be twenty to one."
The last issue of the Militar Wochen
blatt contained the announcement of ten
books by German military writers on the
South African war.
The semi-official Post contains an ar
ticle alleging that Japan is financially un
able to conduct a big war against China,
claiming she has poor credit and no
funds. The Â¦writer saddles the blame
for this state of affairs largely upon
Japan's "systematic discouragement of
foreign capital and prohibition of foreign
ers holding real estate": also on the
"unfairness of the courts toward for
eigners."
"This, too," the writer adds, "Is the
reaj*on why foreign Investments in Japan
are no longer made."

Seizure of Kaiochau.
Lu Hal Houan. the Chinese Envoy Ex
traordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary,
to-day presented to the Foreign Office an
Imperial communication of the date of
June 29. The German Government does
not put any faith ln it- Lieutenant Gen
eral von Lesel to-day had a long Inter
view with Count von Bulow regarding
the political attitude to b'e adopted by
German Embassadors after their arrival
In China.
The Cologne Volka Zeitung to-morrow
will contain an authentic story of tbÂ«
seizure of Kaloehau. The article will
prove that the German Government of
fered to Bishop Anzer In lSaO a protecto
rate over the Catholic missions of the
province of Shantung, which Anzer then
refused. The newspaper also goes on to
show that Bishop Anzer advised the Ger
man Emperor to *elze the northern port
of Kaloehau rather than a southern port,
which advice the German Emneror imme
diately followed, although the German
Minister at Peking at the time. Baron
Heykine. had advised the selection of a
more southerly port. The paper accord
ingly disapproves of the German Catholic
missionary's action, and Intimates that
this was resoonsiDle for the present trou
bles. A similar view, holding the seizure
of Kaloehau responsible for the anarchy
ln China, has recently been taken by a
pumber of German authorities.
I Conger a chance to cable a message from
| Peking, and "while faint hopes are enter-
I talned that they will be successful, it is
generally felt that some such effort
! might well have been attempted by the
British Foreign Office.
i One of the clearest pronouncements
upon China comes from Archibald Roua
Colquhoun, the well known correspondent
of the Landon Times, whose study of Far
j Eastern conditions has made him an au
thority on the subject. Writing to Mr.
Broderick. tho Parliamentary Secretary
of the Foreign Office, Mr. Colquhoun de
clares that unless prompt relief is at
tempted the Europeans will be massa
cred, and if they are able to hold out un
til the revolt subsides there will be "an
indelible impression on the Chinese mlml
! that their escape was due, not to the
strength and determination of Great
Britain, but to their own -forbearance."
He adds:
"The loss of prestige will be. irreparable
in either case. I am convinced that a de
termined assault on the native Hty of
Tientsin would clear the situation and
open the way to Peking."
The commanders now at Tientsin are
not winning golden opinions from the
English public, which, while suspending
severe criticism, falls to see why the
united forces should be so Impotent to
achieve and so apparently outclassed by
the Chinese, not only in numbers, but in
artillery, and. some people are almost In
clined to believe, ln strategy.
Corruption in London.
In Parliament the week was redeemed
frorn. total tediousness by a remarkable
expose of London's corruptness by Sam
uel Smith (Liberal member for Flint
shire) and John Burns (Socialist member
for Batters). The allegations matie by
these membersâ and Home Secretary Rid
ley did not deny them â show conditions
which equal anything discovered by the
Lexow and Mazet committees in New
Yorkâ immoral dens, Â¦ blackmailing and
bribery of the police, apparently flourish-
Ing and trreatly on the increase, especially
in the West End. Degraded criminals,
declared Mr. Burns, who were cleared
out in 18P8, are re-establishing themselves
in large numbers in the metropolis, and
he offered to show Sir Matthew White
Ridley the West End haunts where the
"bestial form of vice of Eastern origin
Is taking root." He also asserted that
"the West End club proprietors and hotel
keepers have the police directly under
their control."
Mr. Burns cited individual Instances and
ended by telling the Home Secretary that
If he did not atop this bribery "the evil
would widen until we have a state of af
fairs in London similar (b what we have
seen In the tenderloin of New York, where
a chief Insp^f tor had earned Â£10.000 a ypar
by blackmailing gambling hells and fallen
women."
All policemen In the West End. Mr.
Burns suggested, should be paid better, as
their present pittance made even trifling
bribes terrible temptations.
The Home Secretary was aghast, and
said he would look into the charge??. â¢
Mr. Smith conlined himself chieflv to
opposing public obscenities. "Many
things," he declared, "were tolerated in
England which would not be allowed in
America."
Shocks Irish Nationalists.
Heartburnings have been caused among
the members of the Irish party by the

Nationalist member for the College Green

accepted her Majesty's invitation and Is a
stanch Parnellite. In fact, he served four
months in Killarney jail and for four days
in winter was left stark naked on a plank

clothes. He appeared at Buckingham Pal

The circular of the Minister of Foreign
Affairs. Count von Bulow. meets singu
larly unanimous approval in the German
press, excepting solely the socialist or
gans, which continue to abuse the Govern
ment for its so-called weltmachtpotlk
(world power policy,), claiming it has
thereby precipitated the Chinese crisis.
The rest of the press and the nation as a
whole fully indorse Count von Bulow's
policy, classing it as wise, moderate and
circumspect. The whole attitude of the
nation toward the understanding between
ihe powers excludes the idea of Germany
seeking separate advantage from action
in China.

PARIS, July 14.â Parisians are begin
ning to realize that their calculations,
based on a series of fetes attending the
expected visits in close sticcesslon of Eu
ropean monarchs, Is going to prove still
born. They believe the King of Sweden
and the Shah of Persia will come for a
short stay in a month's time, but that is
all. The Czar, whose absence is the
greatest disappointment of all; Emperor
William, Queen. Victoria and the Prince
or Naples; whose visits were once spoken
of as certain, will not come to the expo
sition, and after the Shah's departure thÂ»
mansion formerly belonging to the late
Dr. Evans, the famous* American dentist,
which is so luxuriously fitted up for the
reception of crowned heads, can close its
shutters.
This collapse of one of the sides of the
exposition dearest to their hearts Is h
bitter pill for Parisians, who throw the
blame therefor mostly on the Government
â especially for the absence of the Czar,
who is popularly supposed to be Btaytng
away on account of his dislike for Presi
dent Loubet and the socialistic tendencies
of the Government. The absence of the
royalties represents a serious financial
loss to the business community of Paris,
which naturally counted upon a rich
harvest out of tho lavish expenditure
which the entertaining of these visitors
would entail, and also out of the money
spent by the masses of foreign and pro*
vincial sightseers attracted to the capital
by the festivities.
Another exposition fiasco which has dis-
STUntletl numbers of Parisians is the fail
ure of a majority of the side shows, which
sprung up Jike mushrooms within and
about the exposition, and the construc
tion of most of wjjich Involved a heavy
outlav. This failure Is partly due to the
high "sums exacted by the authorities for
concessions and ground lots, while their
profits were estimated on swarms of
pleasure-seekers, who were expected to
pay heavy prices for a mediocre enter
tainment, or for one lasting a quarter of
the time of those given in the ordinary
theaters and cafes chantants within the
city. These expectations have not been
realized, and many of the side shows see
little better than ruin before them. Un
fortunately they were chiefly formed ag
nubile companies in which Parisians
largely investea their savings, and the
latter now see their shares, for which
they paid 100 francs, standing at any
where between 10 and 50 francs.
Nearly forty-five millions of French
money Is sunk ln what promises to result,
unless the situation radically changes for
the better, In a smash. Eleven shows
alone represent at the present Bourse
quotations a loss to the shareholders of
10.S17.500 francs.
The famous E'.ysee outrider Montjarret
who always preceded Presidential proces
sions and who was dismissed recently on
account of a quarrel with a coachman In
the courtyard of the Elyse"e Palace, has
been engaged by Count Boni Castellane to
.ride at tho head of his sumptuous equip
nge. Montjarret was first engaged by
President Caslmir-Perier. and the hand
some figure he cut at the head of the cor
tege made him the dariing of the Parisian
crowds, which always cheered him lusllly.
Some of the Paris papers declare that It
was a fact that his popularity outshone
that of President Loubet and that that
brought about his fall. Judged by the ar
ticles in the press evoked by his dismissal,
the latter attained the proportions of a
great event. Montjarret's biography and
portrait are published, as those of a cele
brity of the day.

LONDON, July 14.â Alexanf^rla Palace,
rivaling in size and conspicousness Madi
son Square Garden and surmounting one
of the highest parts in all London, pre
sented a brilliant spectacle to-night, when
10,000 members of the Society of Christian
Endeavor opened the world's convention.
The night affair was preceded by an after
noon organ recital, an Immense chorus
rendering familiar Christian Endeavor
songs, accompanied by one of the greatest
organs in all England. This was followed
by a second musical service and six simul
taneous secondary services. One of the
most Interesting meetings was held ln Al
bert Hall. Crowds overflowed every avail
able space, and it Is safe to say that sel
dom have two such religious gatherings
ever startled the" lethargic London town.
On one side of the royal arms in the cen
ter of the Alexandria Hall was placed a.
magnificent picture of the Capitol at
Washington, while the opposite side bore
pictures of the houses of Parliament.
From the walls and roof hung the United
States and the British flacs interwoven
with praceful festoons.
Dr. Gibson, formerly of Toronto now of
London, welcomed the members of the So
ciety of Christian Endeavor in behalf of
all Enerland. Honorary Secretary Rev. S.
\V. McKnlght also made an eloquent wel
coming address. The responses were made
by Chaplain W. V. Tracy of Philadelphia.

PARIS, July 14.â The French national
holiday was celebrated with splendid
weather in Paris to-day. Holiday crowds
promenaded the streets, and an immense
concourse made its way to the Bois de
Boulogne to witness the military review.
Fears had been expressed that the lat
ter might prove an occasion for political
excitement of a serious character lor and
against the Government and President
Loubet. Nationalises and Socialists both
announced their intention of marching out
to Long Champs and indulging in demon
strations and counter-demonstrations.
President Loubet left the Klysee Palace
In the afternoon, escorted by cavalry, and
was everywhere cheered, except by one
solitary individual, who shouted as the
President was-passing, "Death to Lou
bet." He was immediately arrested.
The review passed off without serious
accident. A slight conflict occurred be
tween Socialists and Nationalists in tho
Bols. One or two persona were scratched
and a few were arrested. Otherwise there
was no trouble at the review grounds.
On returning to the Eiyseo Palace Pres
ident Loufcet was warmly cheered, but as
he was entering the palace a man cried
"Vive le armee." "Down with Loubet.'"
He was also arrested.
President Loubet after the grand mili
tary review of to-day sent a letter of con
gratulations to General Andre, comment
ing on the splendid appearance of the
army, and saying:
"Ihe modifications deemed necessary "in
the army have now been realized, thanks
to the general co-operation of Parliament
and the patrotism of all the chiefs and all
of the subordinates. This patriotism is a
safeguard of power for this army, which
in itself is the best guarantee of peace "
WOMEN AND CHILDREN
TRODDEN UNDER FOOT
PARIS, July 15.â The only regrettable
incident in connection wfcth the national
fete yesterday (Saturday) occurred at the
conclusion of the fireworks demonstration
at the Place de la Concorde, which was
filled with a dense crowd of people. When
the crowds tried to disperse along the
neighboring thoroughfares they found it
Impossible to move. They were packed
like herrings' ln a barrel. Men, 'women
and children began pushing and a panic
occurred. Women fainted by scores and
many children were' trodden under foot.
At least one hundred women were car
ried to the cafes ln the neighborhood. It
Is impossible to tell how many were in
jured.
No deaths have been reported as yet, al
though It is a marvel that none has oc
curred, because fifty, died on a similar
occasion at the exposition In 1357.

FACTS ABOUT FLOUR.
Made Whlta by I#eaving Out the
Part Which Helps Digest.
Modern methods of milling separate
the parts of the wheat berry that con-
tain the diastatic element, and furnish
only the white flour made up almost en-
tirely of starch.
One of the principal elements needed
to digest this starch has been left out in
the process, and therefore the person
who eats much white bread is almost
sure to have intestinal troubles, for the
starch does not digest properly and
must of necessity decay, and cause all
sorts of trouble.
Grape-Xuts food, on the contrary, is
made up of the entire wheat and bar-
ley, and the processes of digestion as
shown in the human body are copied as
exactly as possible, in a mechanical
way, by the use of moisture, time and
warmth. Xo chemicals or other ingre-
dients are used, but the simple methods
scientifically arranged.
In thi< way the starch of the grain is
transformed into grape sugar, and the
Grape-Xuts food, which appears in a
granular form, shows on the outside of
the little granules, glittering specks of
this grajjc sugar, which is not put onto
the food from the outside, but is a re-
sult of the change of the starch into
graj>e sugar, which works out to the
surface, very much as the sap of the
hickory or rnap!e tree will frequently
show in the shape of white sugar on the
sawed-off ends of logs.
A handful of Grape-Xuts held to the
light will show the little glittering par-
ticles of prape sugar. It is naturally and
scientifically predigested. therefore the
food agrees with the weakest sort of a
stomach. It must not be used in large
quantities at one meal, for it is concen-
trated, and over-feeding of even the
choicest food is not advisable.
Being perfectly cooked at the factory,
the food can be served instantly, either
dry or wet. cold or hot. When wanted
hot. hot water, milk or cream can be
poured over it. There is a definite, dis-
tinct and undeniable gain in nervous
energy and vitality when Grape-Nuts
food is used.

League of the Cross Cadets. The
members of that organization cap
tured the pretty city by the sea without
a 1oe.Â« to their ranks and do not propose
evacuating- until they have won the resi
dents and visitors to their standard. The
capture of the home of the "beachcomb
ers" was neatly planned and carried into
execution by Colonel Power. The cadets
in full panoply of war entered the north
ern end of the city In a special train of
fourteen cars and on disembarking' formed
into line and. headed by their band,
marched to the place of encampment. As
they passed through the main streets they
were greeted with cheers and waving of
handkerchiefs. T_*pon reaching- Camp
O'Ryan. which is situated in the Dolphin
baseball park, within a stone's throw of
the beach, the regiment was marched by
companies to the respective sfreets and
took possession of their tented houses.
Within a short time they were peaceful
and happy and very hungry.
At 7:45 p. m. the entire regiment sat
down to a hearty supper prepared by
Caterer Abrams. The privates sat be
neath a canopy of white muslin. Four
long 1 tables laden with spoons, tin cups
and homemade bread were spread before
the hungry cadets. The boys proved good
trenchermen and left the table fully satis
fied.
Colonel Power and his staff and line of
ficers sat at another table and also did
full Justice to their meal. Rev. Father
Philip O'Ryan. spiritual director of the
regiment, has taken Quarters with the
regiment. Before the boys partook of
food he said grace, which was repeated
by the cadets. Immediately after dinner a
puard was posted round the camp and
strict orders were issued to the cadets
to be in their tents at "laps" or suffer a
night in the guardhouse.
Judjringr by the quiet smiles of the ca
dets, there will be some exciting time? in
the early hours of the morning when they
attempt to evade the puard in entering

quarrel Is th? cause of It all. If his son
Is Incompetent, he says, It was strange he
was permitted to serve seven years.
Carothers junior and King have both been
at the hospital from the besrinnlns. The
whole county is taking sides for or against
King. The case of George, the carpenter,
involves only the question whether the
old board promised to reinstate him upon
his return from Nome. King says that he
does not care when the hearing occurs. If
the board wishes to remove him It can do
so. King made a successful fight in the
Supreme Court before when the attempt
was made to oust him.
TWO OF THE MEN WHO FIG
URE PROMINENTLY IN THE
CONTROVERSY AT THE
UKIAH ASYLUM.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
UKIAH, July 14.â Interest In develop
ments at the asylum Is now at
white heat. The main issue is
whether Superintendent King, who
removed Engineer M. M. Caroth
ers, Carpenter James George and Steward
\V. G. Jones, shall be sustained. The
board of managers has begun an Investi
gation. Four members of the board.
White being absent, have taken testi
mony relative to the cases of the two dis
missed employes, Carothers and George.
The hearing of the Jones case will take
place next Saturday. While much inter
est Is manifested concerning the retalia
tory charges filed by T. L. Carothers
against Superintendent King, the board
has chosen to put off the trial of these
charges until those against the subor
dinates are disposed of. If the subor
dinates are reinstated, such action will
foreshadow something concerning the
possible outcome in the King case.
Ex-Senator Sewell, who has appeared
with J. C. Buddick as counsel for King,
admits this to be a fact. Sewell said to
night: "The board cannot reinstate them
without reversing King, and study of hos
pital management has convinced me that
a hospital cannot succeed without harmo
nious action on the part of the chief and
his staff." The Inference is that if the
subordinates return King will retire. The
appreciation of this fact has given the
keenest zest to public anticipation.
Ihe hearing of tne mst two cases-
George's and Carothers'â took place last
Saturday. The Jones case was to have
been heard to-day. Tnere were not enough
members to make a quorum and tne
Jones case went over until next Saturday.
The charges against King will not be
heard until August 4, and perhaps not so
soon as that.
No dtcisiori will be delivered In the cases
already heard until at least Jones' testi
mony has been taken. The board of man
agers is not Inviting publicity, indeed,
one member of the board said to-night:
"If the general public should come to the
hearing they would not be admitted."
The testimony taken last Saturday was
jealously guarded. A stenographer was
imported from San Francisco that no local
lnlluenc.es might be brought to bear. The
notes were not transcribed, but were
taken to San Francisco, where they now
are. President Foster says that there
may not be money enough to ever have
them transcribed. He also denies that
the members have discussed the testimony
already received, and says that at his ex
press request no opinion was expressed
by any member after the taking of testi
mony last Saturday.
In the meantime there Is a queer situa
tion at the asylum. Secretary F. C. Handy
is acting as steward. Jones remains in his
rooms In the asylum, as he says, to pro
tect his legal rights to the position of
steward. When Superintendent Kin?
asked him to deliver the keys he refused.
Thereupon the iucks were changed on cer
tain doors to prevent Jones from perform
ing any duties as steward. This is Jones'
version. King's statement of the' case dif
fers. King says Jones Is there because
the board of managers requested that
Jones be permitted to remain pending the
decision in his case. His salary Is held
up in the meantime.
Charges of incompeteney and inciting
Inmates to insubordination were filed by
Klns against Jones last week. Jones aids
to the legal snarl by claiming that he was
removed before the charges were filed.
No one interested cares to discuss the tes
timony in advance of the hearing, as the
matter will soon be heard by the board of
If the Managers Reinstate the Discharged Em
ployes It Is Believed Superintendent
King Will Resign.

Questions Answered by the California
Cured Fruit Association.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, July 14.â The executive com
mittee of the California Cured Fruit As
sociation has settled down to solving the
knotty questions confronting it with a
determination which indicates an early
and satisfactory settlement. Among the
matters taken under advisement are the
selection of a head accountant and head
inspector and their assistants. Inquiries
are constantly, being made at the head
quarters of the association as to whether
a packer who la a member of the pack
ers' company has a right to purchase
prunes from a grower not a member of
the association. The answer is an em
phatic no. This is specifically provided
for in the packer's contract and the pen
alty for its violation is a fine of $1000.
A grower, however, who is a member
of the association can, if Â«he chooses, buy
prunes of one not a member artd turn
them over to the association with his own.
The grower's contract covers all prunes
he may handle, whether grown by him
self or some one. else.
A' meeting of the full board of directors
has been called for next Tuesday for the
purpose - of - determining some questions
that are outside the province of the ex
ecutive committee as defined in the by
laws. :^.-y-^-.^.-J:<^% 'Â¦_<"Â¦'Â¦ Â¦-?"

Decision of the Board of Equalization
in Vallejo.
VALLEJO. July U.â The City Trustees

reductions of assessment. M. R. Aden,
owner of $5000 in city water bonds. Mrs.
M. Mathews, who owns $7000. and Joseph
Wilson, who has JSOOO of the same, stated,
that when they took the bonds, the city
was confronted with the failure of tho
water works project because the bomU
could' not be disposed of. Vallejo .people
were assured that water bondd would not
be taxed, and came to the rescue.
After considering the circumstances, tha
board concluded that the request was a
just one and ordered that water bonds be
stricken from the assessment roll. The
board also reduced the assessment of tha
Vallejo Commercial Bank $33,000 upon ap
plication of the cashier. That amount
represented solvent loans, on personal se
curity which cannot be taxed. The baali

Must Pay Taxes.
FORT, WORTH, Tex., July 14.-Gov
ernor Johnson of the Â¦ Chickasaw ' Nation
has ruled that tribal" taxes must be paid.
Hence Buencamino makes a show of ask
ing much from the American Govern
ment in exchange for the cessation of hos
tilities and the recognition of American
toverelRnty, while as a matter of fact he'
does not ask for a single thing of any Im
portance that the military administration
has not already accorded the Filipino peo
ple. But the mass of the people do not
know this, because what the American
Government has done for thi m has never
been concretely written out and placed
before their eyes. Uuencamtno practically
recites what the United States-has already
done for the Filipinos and then says:
â¢â¢We will ask for all this in exchange for
peace." And the Filipino thinks those are
pretty good things to havo and that they
constitute desirable and dignified terms
of capitulation. So it is that the Buen
camino document is written for the Fili
pino people and in that way which argues
for its quickest acceptance by them.
There are, however, one or two mislead
ing statements in Buencamino's communi
cation â notably that which says the con
dition of the Filipino laborer has bettered
with the increase of his earnings. It is
irui Uit later tr Â«jad oftcr. .workman la
Manila earns more to-day than formerly,
but the increase in wage is in no way
commensurate with the cost of living: do
in reality he is worse off. than he was
formerly.
Speaking to a representative of the As
sociated Press, Buencamino said:
"There are three elements operating
against peace in the Philippines to-day.
One Is the friars, who in the ultimate ad
justment of the present trouble between
the Filipinos and Americans" foresee the
final loss of their position- and prestige
in the country as well as of their, proper
tics and wealth.'.'. I believe they seek to
prolong the struggle lu- the hope that
something may arise Â¦ to secure their
standing in -the country and I believe
they are partly accountable for the re
cent rumors of a native uprising In Ma
nila. The second reason is the presence
in Manila of certain hot-headed Filipinos
who persist'in stirring up the people to
continued discontent with the American
occupation.' These men may be called pro
fessional agitators and politicians Â¦: and I
think they should be sought out and sup
pressed. The. third ;iÂ» the stiff-necked at-
UtUto ottkt past military, government la
refusing to treat with the Filipinos ex
cept on the ground of total and uncondi
tional surrender. They ' seem to have
thought the only possible way to termin
ate our misunderstandings was by force
of arms. Â¦ 'WB&SSS^SSSOBA
"The Filipino question no longer calls
for violence and bloodshed. It is now a
question of justice, of a people's inherent
rights and of their right to reasonable
consideration at the hands of ; their vic
tors. It is a question, of principle to which
the application of principles of Justice and
right will speedily bring a peaceful set
tlement."
Correspondence of the Associated Preis.
MANILA, May 25. â Felipe Buencamino.
formerly Secretary of State in the Fili
pino Government, surrendered to the
American forces last December, fully ex
lÂ«'Cting to be shot as soon as it was
learned who he was. Instead of execut
ing him, however, the American officer to
whom Buencamino presented himself In
vited the Filipino to share his supper of
two eggs and a. handful of rice, and the
next day sent him down to Manila- Here
l.e was confined for three months in the
Avela-strcet jail. Shortly before General
Otis left for home, Buencamino was re
leased, and it was understood between
Otis and Buencamino that the latter
thould devote his energies toward effect
ing peace between the Filipino forces and
those oi the United States and the recog
nition of American sovereignty iri the
Philippines by the Filipinos. To this end
Buencamino has composed a peace pro
grammt. copiis of which have been sent
to the prominent leaders of the revolu
tion both In and out of Manila, and it Is
the nurpose of Buencamino to start the
formation of a Philippine National party
on the basis contained in this programme,
&. faithful translation of which follows:
As tie DKMOt Filipino revolution Is a direct
result of the Si.amsh- American war. and as we
have declared {he United States to be the pro
tecting j-ower of our independence it is un-
MtJslble m accordance with international law.
jor us to do without the United States in the
matter of obtaining our national independence,
because no country can enter into the concert
of independent nations except in accordance
with the rules of that law.
The proclamation of Emilio Aguinaldo, dated
Mav .4 ISM, the revolutionary help given by
our" troosa during the war between Spain and
â¢the United States, and the treaty of Paris.
dated December 10. 1S9S. conspired to give to
the United ftatea the role of protecting power
ever the Philippines, as well as that of the bel
ligerent power, to whom tpain sold aJl her
rights lor twenty million dollars. And If to the
foregoing legal deductions we add the fact that
the United States has clearly shown its deter
mination to intervene in our future, the impos
eibilitv of resitting its intervention becomes
ttiil nacre evident and clear.
Islands Might Be Sold.
It is possible that the Tnited States, eventual
ly weary of our present system of warfare,
may d.c'ide to sell ins to tome other power, or
e:?e leave us to our fate, in which latter case
it would devolve uj>cn us to obtain the recogni
tion of our inder*ri i '<*n' % e from the nations of
the wrrhi. This possibility is fraught with
the imminent danc-r that we fall a victim
to the ambitions of the great nations and be
come partitioned air.onc them.
CoBteQUeotly, it is necessary that we recog
nize the supremacy of the I'nited Ftates and
ttrive to obtain, within the limits of the Amer
ican cunetitution. the greatest measure of lib
trty compatible with our welfare.
i"i>e most predominant feature In our past in
dependent government were those immoralities
Ejid abu:-es which are the offspring of our own
isnorar.ee and the vices inherited by us from
t-jain.
We succeeded in making the Filipino regime
fo odious to our own people that in the critical
moments of our aifalrs the people showed us
their hatred; they respected neither Cabinet of
ficers nor the pert-ona of the mother and the
ton of the President of the Filipino republic,
whom they sold to the Americans after first
lavir.ff murdered many of the leaders, officers
and Fiirtjers of our army, and they have robbed
cur Â«J merriment of its properties and money.
Me require. th?n, the protecting power of the
l"r.itc-d states to prevent our national unity
from defiruction by those civil wars which,
owing to the factional feelings and division*
ensuing from our immoralities and abuses,
â¢would undoubtedly obtain were an independent
government established.
The roncillatery policy pursued by the Amer
ican Government, notwithstanding our marked
hostility to it; the humane treatment of
r:1f=on*>rs and their reiease from prison after
thort detention only: the installation into pub
lic office of thÂ«? more intelligent KiliDinos; the
increase in wages and the consequent better
rr.ent <if the laboring classes: the liberal reform
in our laws, and the granting to our towns
<â¢{ a marriage an 1 municipal law eminently
democratic and such as we did not possess even
under our own independent Government â all
this has increased the sentiment for annexa
tion to an extraordinary degree and to-day
there is among us the keenest conu*tiUon for
all Government employments.
Should the time come when our clashing In
terests -win lead brother to fight against
brother we will then indeed be unfortunate and
to be pitied. The Americans will dominate un
der these deplorable circumstances and we will
be helpless. !
Should Form a Party.
If, notwithstanding our fleeting political dis
tentior.F. we on manage to preserve our na
tional unity we will always be a respectable
nation of ten millions of people and capable
ultimately at obtaining our national emancipa
tion; but if we are divided by the lrreconcil
abie hatreds which lead to civil strife we will
t>e nothing more nor less than- a group of tribes
and we c<--uld easily be reduced to the level of
the ncmad Irorrotes.
For these reasons *e should cease hostilities
with the United Ptates and form a national
Tarty which, if we take advantage of the op
portunities of the present moment, will always
be in the majority.
Another powerful argument for peace Is the
fa<-t that in continuing our present system of
puÂ«"rr!l!a warfare we irive an excuse for the bad
figment of our population to live by force of
arms at the coÂ«t of their more peaceful neigh
bors. Under the guise nf patriots these former
take the field, not to fight for our independence,
tut simply to rob and enrich themselves, and
brigandage is consequently prevalent. The ill
effects of such action." are already felt through
the land, and they have riven to our cau^e- a
reputation for criminal methods and abuse*.
The national party would show great politi
cal discernment and good sense were they to
cease hostilities and co-operate with the es
tsbliEhed authorities In the prosecution of those
bandits and robbers who have during the last
few months succeeded in dragging the fair
fame of the Filipino revolution to their low
level.
In view of the foregoing we believe the fol
lowing resolutions should be adopted:
Flret â Recognize the supremacy of the United
Ftates by a cessation of hostilities; obey the
American authorities and loyally co-operate
with tlfeni in the work of pacification.
Secondâ Ask from the Government of the
Visited States the declaration that we be al
lowed the enjoyment of personal rlrht* fruar
ent<>e<J t>y the American constitution. Kxcep
t!on If made of our political rights until Â«uch
time as Cor.grtss shall definltelv determine our
Juture.

Kighthâ The friars Fiiall be excluded from the
administration of the Philippine Catholic
Church.
"Worded to Please the Natives.
For Fuch a peace propaganda to be ac
ceptable to the Filipino people and more
especially to the morÂ« stubborn element
thereof, it must flatter them and appeal
to their national vanity. They must be
cajoled Into believing that they are In
flating upon terms and stipulations from
the TJnited States Government, that con
cisions are given them, that they are
Fiill an Important factor in the situation
and that their consent Is needed to any
frcttlprnent. If such a peace programme
us tbe forepolng appeafatto their vanity
It has a much better chaace of being ac
cepted by them than were It a simple busi-
DtÂ£s proposition, devoid, o! *U sentiment.

PERSONAL MENTION.
l Â» OLLOWING the example of representatives of
I other large interests of the country, the delegates
to the convention of the National Educational
Association have by resolution demanded of the Gov
ernment a fuller recognition of the value of their
work, and a more comprehensive system of promoting
and extending it. The convention did not go so far
as to ask for the creation of a department of educa
tion, to be under the direction of a Cabinet officer,
but it did ask for an improvement in the existing
methods of the Government in dealing with educa
tional affairs.
After pointing out several reasons why there should
be an enlargement of the sphere of governmental ac
tivity in matters of public education, the resolutions
of the convention say: "We earnestly urge upon the
Congress the wisdom and advisability of reorganizing
the Bureau of Education upon broader lines, erecting
it into an important department on a plan with the
Department of Labor; providing a proper compen
sation for the Commissioner of Education, and of so
constituting the Department of Education that while
its invaluable function of collating and diffusing in
formation be in no wise impaired, it may be equipped
to exercise oversight over the educational system of
Alaska and of the several islands now dependent upon
us, as well as to make some provision for the educa
tion of the children of the tens of thousands of white
people domiciled in the Indian Territory, but who are
without any educational opportunities whatever.
Such reorganization of the Bureau of Education and
such extension of its functions we believe to be de
manded by the highest interests of the people of the
United States, and we respectfully but earnestly^ask
Congress to make provision for such reorganization
and extension at their next session. The action so
strongly recommended will in no respect contravene
the principle that it is one of the recognized functions
of the National Government to encourage and to aid
but not to control the educational instrumentalities of
the country."
To that plea the general public will give a cordial
approval. It docs not ask anything that can be ac
counted as excessive. In fact, a considerable number
of the American people would not be unwilling to
have the Federal Government give aid to the poorer
Southern States in providing means for the education
of their people, and to some extent directing the work
from Washington. That much was made evident by
the favor shown to the educational bill which the late
Senator Blair used to bring forward with such per
sistency; and while it has become the settled policy
of the Government to leave the duty of public educa
tion to the States to provide for, there is still a great
deal that can be, done in the way of direction and
counsel by a strong and well equipped Bureau of
Education at Washington. The issue of popular in
struction concerns the republic as a whole, and since
it must attend to such matters, to some extent, it
will be well to establish a system of attending to it
properly.
THE DEMANDS OF EDUCATORS.
This play will hardly add to Ibsen's reputation. The best
thing In It Is the study of artistic selfishness as Incarnated in
Rubek the man who "placed the dead clay image (of art)
above the happiness of life-of love." The character of Irene,
with its bursts of Insanity, may Interest the professors oS
Alienism and may properly be referred to them for an expert
opinion. Maia is one of those extraordinary married women,
to be found nowhere out of Ibsen, who combine the shrewdness
of a middle-aged Parisian bourgeolse with the Innocence of a
Quaker girl of 14. Ulfhelm, who fascinates her, 13 a Sevea
Dials ruffian of the most blatant type.
The philosophy of the play revolves within the usual nar
row circle of Ibsen fixed Ideas, to wit:
1. Marriage is a failure.
2. Most people either don't know this or find It out too late?,
3 True liberty consists in doing exactly what you please.
4. There is only one side to life â the seamy side.
6. Elective affinities are the surest guides to right conduct.

as they are whirled along with the masses of snow and

THE INCREASE OF CRIME.
JUST now, while the nations arc following up, in
China, the efforts of the missionaries with can
non, it is not pleasant to be told that our do
mestic morals are not in good health.
Any form of the religious idea must be judged by
its effect upon the morality and conduct of the peo
ple among whom it is propagated.
That idea is their moral light, the illumination in
which they live, the conscience that is their guide of
conduct. Its test is, rirst, do they live up to that light?
j And, second, what manner of life does it induce in
j them, what form of conduct?
i If fhese make for the moral uplift and the people are
! generally raised thereby, they are like a light set upon
a hill. The religious idea which ha9 advanced them,
informed their conscience, righted their lives and
made them individually and in the mass an example
in righteousness to all men, becomes for these reasons
a missionary religion, and is carried abroad that it
! may in like manner sweeten human life for others.
With these simple principles in view, it would seem
to be time for the American people to indulge in
some rigid self-examination. Great trouble is abroad
in the world, having its radix in the Christian mis*
I sionary invasion of China. All that we hear from
I there confirms this view. The ancient religions of
I China are part of the civilization of the people, and
I this is closely knit into the fabric of their govern
ment. Since trouble began in that far country we
have heard much from American missionaries about
the immorality, public and private, which it is our
duty to put down in China. It has been said, too, that
it is our Christian duty "to deliver" those people
from the bonds and limitations that are upon them,
and carry to them our Christian civilization, thus
taking their feet out of the paths that lay hold on hell
and putting them in the way of salvation.
Now, dealing with this matter wholly in what may
be called its material aspect, and carefully keeping
hands off the spiritual considerations involved,
which have their interest solely in the future life and
the happiness or misery of the soul after it leaves the
body, we wish to consider what grounds we have for
going abroad to better the moral conditions of other
people, and thereby, as in China, aid in bringing upon
the world war. which is the sum of all miseries.
We leave it to casuists to settle the question that
the future of the soul h of higher importance than the
present of the body, r.nd to separate morals and con
duct from faith. But however they may settle these
things, the lay mind will forever concern itself with
the matters of life and conduct. A man .may daily
proclaim himself elect, his calling made and
his election sure, and follow such courses as
are abhorrent to even the unregenerate heart,
without inspiring any one by his example. So,
after all, it is the effect of inner light upon
the outward man to which we look when making
up our judgment as to the effect of any form of the
religious idea upon those who profess it. Judged by
these standards the United States has no call to go
abroad seeking the heathen in his blindness, nor to
deliver his land from error's chain.
The increase of crime in this country is one of the
most startling facts in the history of the world. It
began with the close of our Civil War, and the gain
has been steady ever since. It was then set down to
the demoralizing influence of war, something that
students of sociology well understand. But they also
understand that the impulse is spent upon the genera
tion that was in contact with that influence, and grad
ually ceases. Not so here. The impulse has gained,
and is higher now than at any previous period in our
history.
The moral degeneracy of the United States is dis
cussed in the Forum. The writer says:
"The belief that crime in the United States is on the
increase is widespread and commonly accepted. We
find it difficult to reconcile such a belief with our op
timism as to our national progress. Are we to be
lieve, as the preacher and the moralist sometimes
ever, that our material growth has been at the ex
pense of our moral standards; that in the race for
wealth our people have been losing that wholesome
respect for law and righteousness which formerly pre
vailed? If we admit the fact can we deny the con
clusions? We may deny that there is a dark spot on
the picture of our national progress, or we may pass
it over in silence; but a matter involving such mo
n-.entous consequences for our social life should be
faced and not shirked. The American people have not
accepted the conclusion that crime is increased in the
United States without the weightiest evidence in be
half of such a proposition. A review of the writers
who have touched upon this subject seems to place
the fact beyond question. In his standard work on
'Recent Economic Changes' the late David A. Wells
said:
" 'In the United States, while crime has diminished
in a few States, for the whole country it has within
recent years greatly increased. In 1850 the propor
tion of prison inmates was one to every 3448 of the
entire population of the country, but in 1880 this pro
portion had risen to one for every 855. These results
are believed to be attributable in the Northern States
mainly to the great foreign immigration, and in the
Southern to the emancipation of the negroes.'
"Mr. Henry M. Boies in his work on 'Prisoners
and Paupers' is still more emphatic. Commenting on
the returns of the census of 1890 he says: 'Some of
the disclosures made are, however, shocking, if not
appalling, in the highest degree, to our confidence in
the future. One of these is the abnormal and dispro
portionate increase in the criminal class of society.
That increase is from one in 3500 of our population in
1850 to one in 786 in 1800, or 445 per cent, while our
population has increased but 170 per cent in this same
period. In the last decade, with an increase of 24 per
cent in population, the number of inmates in our jails,
penitentiaries and reformatories has increased 45 per
cent, or nearly twice as fast as the population. Such
disproportion cannot continue indefinitely without re
lapse into barbarism and social ruin; it is the more
startling because such a state of things does not exist
in other civilized nations, as public records show.
"English and other writers also echo the same
opinions. Mr. William Douglass Morrison, in his
work on 'Crime/ spesks of the increase of crime in
! the United States as a fact universally recognized and
i attested by such high authorities as Wells and Wines.
\ Mr. William Tallack quotes General Brinkerhoff of
! Ohio as being able to show in 1885 that the tide ot
I crime in the United States was rising with alarming
j rapidity."
From this exhibit it would seem that missionaries
in search of a hard job, and wishing to spend some
where the spirit of sacrifice, need not go to China to
j find a chance.
Such issues r.rc hardly less important than the great
questions of government involved in the Presidential
contest. For that teason they must not be over
looked by any good citizen. Let every loyal Repub
lican do his full duty at every step in the campaign.
Let him be as earnest in the struggle for the election
of delegates to the county convention as he is going
to be in the Presidential contest itself, and then the de
feat of the schemes of the bosses and the corporations
Â¦null be certain.
It can be readily seen what an advantage will be
piven to the railroad and its allied tools of both par
ties if they have it in their power to redistrict the
State. They can gerrymander the districts in such a
manner as to give them great power in determining
the election of Assemblymen. Senators and Congress
men for ten years to come. Moreover, if they be per
mitted to elect their candidates for State Scnatorship?
they will have a large number of hold-over votes for
a railroad candidate for the United States Senate in
190*
That the boodlcrs of politics and the railroad are
combined is beyond question. The Southern Pacific
managers, the Democratic ward bosses and Kelly and
Crimmins are now so close together that one blanket
would cover them all. It is a close combination, and
it is formidable, but it is not invincible. More than
once in recent contests have the better elements of
the Republican party routed the corrupt gangs that
tried to use it for base purposes, and what has been
done so many times by the united action of good men
can be done again. There is nothing in the situation
to discourage loyal Republicans. On the contrary
there is everything to rouse them to a sense of their
political duties and encourage them to resolute ac
tion.
In the campaign for the spoils the bosses are not
divided. Kelly and Crimmins are in full agreement
with Rainey and the other bosses of the Democratic
part\ r and with the political touts of the Southern Pa
cific. No conflict cf interest is in their camp nor any
dissensions in their councils. Should they succeed in
electing a Legislature subservient to their domination
the'State will be redistricted to suit their purposes
regardless of any other consideration whatever.
The rcdistricting of the State and the election of a
United States Senator to succeed Perkins are matters
cf as much interest to the public as to the bosses and
the corporations. It happens, however, that the aver
age citizen does not study political situations as
closely as the professional politicians do, and conse
quently often loses an advantage that might have been
gained by the exercise of greater vigiiance and
energy. That is what is liable to happen in this in
stance. The bosses and the corporations are now lay
ing plans to obtain control of the Legislature so they
can fix the Congressional, Senatorial and Assembly
districts to suit themselves, and unless . the better
classes of the people are alert and resolute to beat
them, the cunning schemes will be successfully car
ried out
fHE IMPORTANCE OF THE CONTEST.
BY the \\s.rd bosses, by the "push" of both par
ties and by the political managers of the South
ern Pacific Railroad, the importance of
he coming election is fully understood and ap
jreciated. They may be indifferent, to the great
ssues at stake in the national contest, but
:hey are heedful and vigilant concerning those
.vhich will affect the political control and pa-
Tonage cf the State. They are aware that
ollowing the census of this year the Legislature will
:ave next winter to reapportion the Assembly, Sena
orial and Congressional districts. They also; keep in
r.:nd the fact that this year there will be elected a
number of Senators who will hold over and have a

ALL PLEDGES FULFILLED.
PRESIDENT McKINLEY in replying to the
notification of his renomination by the Repub
lican party had the satisfaction of being able
to recall the pledges he made when nominated four
years ago and pointing out that all of them have
been fulfilled. Such a record is one of which an offi
cial might be proud under any circumstances, and
when the difficulties that confronted the President â
the industrial depression of the country when he took
office, the war with Spain and the complex questions
arising from the results of the war â are considered,
it will be seen that in his case the fulfillment of all
pledges is a proof of the highest statesmanship.
The President's own words on the subject are worth
noting. He recalled what he had spoken four years
ago referring to the need of legislation to establish
our monetary S3'stem on a sound basis, to restore our
industrial supremacy, our productive capacity, our
commerce and prosperity, to renew public confidence
in the integrity of the nation, to augment the rev
enues and confirm national credit, and to provide
ample work for the people, and then added:
"Three and a half years of legislation and ad
ministration have been concluded s!nce these words
were spoken. Have those to whom was confided
the direction of the Government kept their pledges?
The record is made up. The people are not unfa
miliar with what has been accomplished. The gold
standard has been reaffirmed and strengthened. The
endless chain has been broken and the drain upon
our gold reserve no longer frets us. The credit of the
country has been advanced to the highest place
among all nations. We are refunding our bonded
debt bearing 3 and 4 and 5 per cent interest at 2 per
cent, a lower .rate than that of any other country,
and already more than $300,000,000 has been so
funded, with a gain to the Government of many mil
lions of dollars. Instead of 16 to I, for which our
opponents contended four years ago, legislation has
been enacted which, while utilizing all forms of our
money, secures one fixed value for every dollar, and
that the best known to the civilized world. A tariff
which protects American labor and industry and pro
vides ample revenues has been written in public law.
We have lower interest and higher wages, more
money and fewer mortgages. The world's markets
have been opened to American products, which go
now where they have never gone before. We have
passed from a bond-issuing to a bond-paying nation;
from a nation of borrowers to a nation of lenders;
from a deficiency in revenue to a surplus; from fear
to confidence; from enforced idleness to profitable
employment. The public faith has been upheld; pub
lic order has been maintained. We have prosperity
at home and prestige abroad."
Has there ever before been a statesman of any land
or any age who in seeking from his fellow citizens an
indorsement of his stewardship has been able to show
a more notable record of pledges fulfilled, expecta
tions realized and prosperity assured?
McKinley has been tried and found true to eveiy
duty of his high office. He has shown himself su
perior to every emergency that has arisen in peaca
or in war. His platform is his record. By what he
has been in the past we can safely judge what he will
be in the future. The whole country can readily unite
with Senator Lodge in saying to him: "Your elec
tion and the triumph of the Republican party â which
we believe to be as sure as the coming of the day â
will make certain the steady protection of our indus
tries, sound money and a vigorous and intelligent
foreign policy. They will continue those conditions
of good government and wise legislation so essential
to the prosperity and well being which have blessed
our country in such abundance during the past four
years."
IBSEN is now 72 years old. If one may Judge from the qual
ity of hts last play, "When the Dead Awaken (H. S.
Stone. Chicago), his lifework is done. MÂ°reÂ° v 'X. be mtS

The play opens at the inevitable Norwegian water Ins place

some four or five years. Rubek , ,

far as Rubek is concerned, there s&%&G%&

ishable marble unless she were
ISrwh^rh^un'SdV^Poe^oui. Far from resenting : the re
appearance of the old love. Mala welcomes it. for she like
Rubek. has decided that marriage without community of tastes
and interests is a mistake. She has found one Ulfhcim. a bear
hunter, a veritable primitive man, who can talk to her of
horses and dogs, hunting and camping-things in which she
delights- with the frankness of a true Ibsen heroine she in
forms her husband that she wishes to go off to the mountains
on an expeditUn with Ulfheim and (somewhat unnecessarily)
asks for the marital permission to do so. This, it Is hardly
more necessary to add, is instantly given, for Rubek had also
decided to go to these same mountains that he might there
commune with Irene, the one woman, he finds, who can inspire
him to artistic achievement. With this charming situation the
first act closes.
The second act opens at a mountain health resort. In a
long conversation Rubek and Mala "have it out"; he had mar
ried her. it appears, after Irene had left him and "The Resur
rection Day" had made him famous, because she was a pretty
luxury that he liked to feel he could afford; but he confesses
to her- that (touching his breast) "In here, you seeâ in here I
have a little bramah-locked casket. And In that casket all my
sculptor's visions are stored up. But when Irene disappeared
and left no trace, the lock of the casket snapped to. And she
had the keyâ and she took it away with her. You, little Maia,
you -had no key; so all that the casket contains must He unused.
And the years pass! And I have no means of getting at the
treasure."
MAIA.
IRENE.
(Trying to repress a subtle smile)â Then get her to turn the
key for you againâ we two will simply get out of each other's
wa'yâ part entirely. I shall always find something new for
myself, Tiere or there in the world. Something free! Free!
Free! No need to be anxious about that, Professor Rubek!
With this conclusion she hands him over to the other lady
and proceeds to make her preparations for the expedition with
the bear hunter. We now learn for the first time why Irene
had left Rubek;

DISPLAY FLAGS
FOR THAT BIG
CELEBRATION
Talk of Reconsideration of
the Award Made on
Last Friday.
What the Foresters of America In
tend Doing for the Grand
Parade â Ancient Order
of Workmen.
There is a possibility that at the next
meeting of me general committee of the
semi-centennial celebration of the ad
mission of California into the Union there
will be a movement to rescind the action
that was taken last Friday night in the
matter of special design flags for the use
of the decorations committee, on the
ground that there was a misunderstand
ing when the committee named was
given full power to act.
The decorations committee at a pre
vious meeting had been authorized to
secure designs and bids for such special
flags. During the week the committee re
ceived a number of proposals, and from
among the number selected those of B.
Pasquale & Sons, the Columbia Notion
and Toy Company and M. Feigenbaum.
In the opinion of a majority of the com
mittee, which is composed of H. L. Gunz
berpcr. R. P. Doolan. Louis Xonnemann,
M. A- Dorn. I. Harris, Frank L. Coombs,
Fred Suhr Jr., John A. Stelnbach andDr.
C. W. Decker, the designs furnished by
Feigenbaum were more artistic and
striking than those presented by the
other firms, but there was an objection
to their recommending them to the gen
eral committee for adoption. That was
the price. Feigenbaum charged 19Â»s
cents per flag In lots of 1000 of each de
sign, while Pasquale charged but 10 cents,
and the toy company 10^ cents. It was
decided to submit the matter to the gen
eral committee without recommendation
from the sub-committee. The several de
signs were spread on the floor and during
a recess were viewed by all present. The
general idea, after the view, was that
the wisest plan would be to select the
four best and most appropriate designs
submitted by each bidder. The decora
tions committee stated that the bidders
each wanted a contract for the eight de
s'igns or none. Then followed a number
of motions and amendments, and finally
one to refer the matter back to the com
mittee was lost, and one to refer the mat
ter to the committee with full power to
act was carried.
"When this was announced one of the
An hour after this the decorations com
mittee asked permission to file a *sup
plemental report, and such being granted.
Chairman Gunzberger stated that the
members of the committee had met Mr.
Feicrenbaum. who is a member of the
order, and that he haQ agreed to accept
16Vi cents for each flap, and that the
contract had been awarded to him. This
announcement was met with a motion
that the award be not ratified on the
ground that the announcement had been
made that the 10 cent proposition would
be accepted, but Chairman Frank H.
Dunne held that the motion could not be
entertained for the reason that the sub
committee had been given full power to
act.
The other bidders felt disappointed at
the result, and It is more than likely that
at the next meeting something will be
done to undo what was done on Friday.
It is not known how many flags will be
needed, but the number majr be from
10.000 to 20.000.
The San Francisco extension committee
of the Ancient Order of United Workmen
was waited on last evening by a repre
sentative of the parade committee on the
matter of the order being represented
in the parade. The committee will rec
ommend to the board of corporate direct
ors at its next meeting that some action
be taken. It is probable that the Work
men will be represented in line by two
symbolical floats, and that on a third one
the degree team of the Degree of Honor,
the ladies' auxiliary, will make a. display
In costume. There is a possibility that
the degree teams of the Workmen lodges
in this city, Oakland, San Jose and Sac
ramento, in uniform, will act as guard of
honor to the ladles' auxiliary-
The American Order of Foresters have
under consideration the turning out of an
appropriate float and about 2500 members
of courts In uniform caps and sashes, and
each carrying a branch of pine surround
ed by a small American flag.
sub-committee members remarked that
that being the case, it was likely that
the 10 cent designs would be selected.
WAR REVENUE STAMPS

Business men. Insurance companies and

The United States transport Hancock
was released from quarantine late yester
day afternoon, but she did not dock. Cap
tain "Struve brought her down into the
stream off the transport wharf and an
chored. When the Sumner sails to-mor
row at noon the Hancock will take her
place at Folsom-street wharf.
All the cabin passengers were landed
on tue tug Fearless, bui the soldiers will
not be brought ashore until to-day. Of
the five deaths during the voyage not one
was a case that could have been saved.
The men were practically doomed when
put aboard at Manila, and it was only
the unremitting care of the doctors and
nurses that kept them alive as long as
they did. Of the insane men two jumped
overboard and were drowned. A th.ra
attempted to end his life, but was caught
in the act. All the cabin passengers who
came up on the Hancock join in saying
that the back of the rebellion is broken
and that in a few months the insurgents
will submit.
The chances are that the Hancock will
follow the Sumner on August 1, and that
the Meade will be overhauled. Men and
provisions are urgently needed in the
Philippines and in China, but the Meade (
is in need of overhauling and the chances [
are she will not sail until after the War- j
ren. The Californian, with 10,000 tons of \
merchandise aboard, will get away at 10 j
a. m. to-morrow and the Sumner with
6oO troops and abput a thousand tons of |
freight will sail two hours later. !
Ships Block the Way.
During the past few days a big fleet
of vessels have arrived from foreign ports
and, owing to the rule laid down by the
United States Quarantine Officer, It Is now
almost Impossible to pass Messs Wharf
during a uark night with any degree of
safety. The ships John Ena, Yosemite.
Sir Robert Fernie. Afon Alav.-, Robert
Duncan, Craiareme, Hiddikel and half a
dozen others are stretched between Black
Point and Alcatraz and a sailing vessel,
compelled to anchor and await the arrival
of the doctor, has a mighty hard time of
it finding a spot free from danger.
Friday evening the John Ena arrived
from Newcastle, Australia, and the cap
tain, finding no place where he could an
chor with safety outside the quarantine
lines, held on up the bay. Dr. Klnyoun
chased after him In the Governor Perkins
and made the big ship anchor. The cap
tain had to secure a tug and tow back
to Black Point, where the ship lay all
night, awaiting pratique. Also owing to
the crowded state of the fairway the Sir
Robert Fernie and Yosemite were in col
lision, and many more accidents are ex
pected before the fairway is cleared.
Water Front Notes.
A young Frenchwoman, who would not
eiveher name, attempted to Jump from a
Sausallto ferry boat yesterday. She was
turned over to Serjeant Tom Mahoney.
who sent her out to the Central station.
There she was questioned, but refused to
disclose her Identity or give her name.
She was released.
Captain Smith of the bark Mauna Ala
will return home on the Australia. Cap
tain Hamilton Is In command of the ves
sel.
Captain Murchison, who waited here
three months for the overdue Americana,
la now In command of the ship John Cur
rier. Murchison got tired of awaiting the
arrival of the schooner, so he reinsured
his share In her at prices ranging from
20 to 30 per cent and went north. He
had barely taken command of the John
Currier when the news of the arrival of
the Americana, in distress, at Honolulu
reached here.

At $20 per ton below present' price

say 20 per cent on total capital) â $1,300,000
"With sugar at the present price the
net profit would be 2,500,000
Or SO per cent upon the total capital.
"Is It not qu!te possible, Mr. Dilllng
ham, that this wonderful showing of yours
will, if published, be criticized by sugar
men here and at the Islands?"
"More than likely, but as I believe that
'truth crushed to earth shall rise again.'
I am not afraid to stand by any state
ments I have made. History would not be
repeating itself In this case if severe criti
cism did not follow. While I have no de
sire to bocm sugar stocks, they are good
enough to stand upon their own merits. I
see no harm in stating the truth in this
connection. It is my good fortune to have
been instrumental in starting successfully
seven of the best sugar producing proper
ties In Hawaii. Some of them have and
all will return a net profit upon their
original capital varying from 25 per cent
to 100 per cent per annum, yet none of
these good properties have escaped the
venom of the human tongue.
"In 1892, when Ewa Plantation was in its
Infancy, it was dubbed a failure. Knowing
ones said the water was too salt and
the land was sour. Men high in authority
on sugar said It could never be made to
pay. The agents. Messrs. Castle & Cooke.
were strongly advised to abandon that en
terprise when it owed them over $400,000
upon the generally accepted theory that
the first is the smallest loss. At that time
the total capital stock of Ewa was JoOO.OCO
and the stock was offered at $70 a share,
or ?350,000 for the plantation. One of the
wealthiest sugar men in the Islands, who
had quite a large holding in Ewa at that
time, told me he wished he had never seen
that plantation. Nevertheless Ewa Planta
tion has since that date paid for itself
more than five times. The net profit of
that plantation will exceed $1,000,000 this
year. Oahu Plantation, started in 1SD7,
was also denounced by many 'wiseacres,'
but it promised to bfl very nearly If not
quite equal to Ewa when fully developed.
It turned off about twelve tons of sugar
per acre this year, and its stock la held at
nearly $200 per share, or double its par
value. Such an enormous yield of sugar
causes the expense of pumping water for
irrigation to sink into comparative insig
nificance. Kahuku, "YVaialua. Kihei,
McBride and Olaa all in their
turn have been severely criticized
and even condemned In various
ways. But It Is very safe to say without
fear dfTontradiction from future results
that no better or safer investments for
capital can be fcund in the world to-day
than the stock in any of the enterprises I
have named.
"And it is also safe to say that It Is ex
ceedingly doubtful if the stocks in any of
these comparatively new plantations "will
ever be lower than they are now. In
three or four years from now there la
good reason to believe that the capital
stock of all the plantations started since
1SS6 will be worth in the markets of the
world from two to four times their par
value. The real merit of the sugar indus
try in I la-wail has in the past been little
understood outside of the narrow limits
of that country. Some very erroneous
ideas have been entertained as to the pos-
Flble developments of sugar In Hawaii It
was believed by -many that the require
ments of the whole of thia country for
sugar could be produced In those Islands
Our present output is equal to about one
eighth of the sugar consumed in the
TJnited States, and it Is exceedingly doubt
ful if we ever produce more than 750 000
tons, at which time the consumption in

Many things must be considered in ar
riving at the value of a plantation be
sides the area of the cane lands, But the
capitalization per acre of cane land Is, in
the rough, a fair comparison of relative
values between similarly situated plan
tations.
It will be seen' from the foregoing table
that of the 20 representative plantations
enumerated, with one exception. Olaa
stock Is now offered at a lower price per
acre of cane land than any other named.
With its enormous area of cane landâ
1500 acres more than even the Ha
waiian Commercial, heretofere the largest
in the countryâ it is as certain as any fin
ancial probability can be. that Olaa stock
will eventually go to a high premium.
"I notice Ewa plantation is valued at
$5,000,000 with 5500 acres of land, which
makes the land under full development
with all improvements appear to be worth
$1450 per acre. Is that land held by the
company in fee?"
"No; it holds a forty-year lease from
the Oahu Railway Company, bearing an
annual rental of 4 per cent on all the
sugar raised, which will amount this year
to about $S4,000. The net profit of Ewa
plantation this year will be over $1,000,000,
which is equal to the original cost of the
whole plantation to the original investors;
such a result may suggest the wisdom of
getting in on the 'ground floor' and assist
in the development of a good sound sugar
producing enterprise. I don't wish to be
understood, however, as representing that
other new plantations or possibly any
other plantation will produce as much
sugar per acre as 'Ewa,' but the best new
plantations, with very much larger area
of land, having an abundance of water,
free from the expense of artificial irriga
tion, may be able to produce sugar at as
low a cost per ton and thereby prove to
be equally profitable to their stockhold
ers."
"Mr. Diningham, there Is an impression
over here that the islanders have mon
opolized about everything in that country
that is worth having and that they don't
really want to see outside Investors come
in. Is there, in your opinion, good grounds
for such an impression?"
'If such an impression does exist,
which I am unwilling to believe, nothing
could be farther from the truth. There
has never, in my humble opinion, been a
time in the history of the Hawaiian Isl
ands when there were better opportuni
ties for safe and profitable investment
than the present. The people at the Isl
ands are not only willing, but desirous
to have capital flow in from the outside
world. If people want good steady 6 to
12 p\sr cent Investments, there are plenty
of good dividend-paying plantations that
will pay such dividends regularly. The
percentage of returns will, of course,
vary with the rise and fall of sugar in
the world's market. If people prefer to
buy stocks, in an old established dividend
paying plantation they must expect to
pay the market price for such stock, re
gardless of the original cost, whether it
be at a margin of two for one or ten
for one. If investors want to get in on
the 'ground floor' they must buy into the
new plantation and take their chance
with the island people. Yes, it is true that
the islands have become a very prosper
ous sugar-producing country. In point
of scientific methodf, high-class machin
ery and economy of management, Ha
waii leads the world to-day in the pro
duction of cane sugar and will, I believe,
never see the day when she cannot hold
her own with any present or prospective
competitor. Hawaii as an agricultural
country of the highest class has gained
her position through years of hard strug
gle, financially and otherwise. The pro
duction of sugar in that country was for
many years conducted in almost crude
\and experimental way.
"To bring the sugar Industry to the
safe, conservative?, dividend-paying basis
it has reached to-day has cost many
hard-earned fortunes and experimental
losses that were hard to bear. It Is only
just and fair to the honest, industrious
people of those islands to say they are
certainly entitled to all the wealth which
the fertile soil of that country can possi
bly give."
"Speaking of new plantations. Mr. Dil
lingham, what plantations can you rec
ommend for investment with a view of
buying stock that will in your judgment
increase in value 100, 200 or 300 per cent
upon their original capitalization?"
"If sugar should decline $20 per ton
below the present price, I feel confident
that the following named new planta
tions, under their usual good manage
ment, will be able to pay 5 per cent upon
three or four times their original capi
tal stock, viz.: Honolulu Sugar Com
pany, Iitd.; Oahu Sugar Company, Ltd.;
Waialua Agricultural Company. Ltd.;
Kihei. Sugar Company, Ltd.; McBride
Sugar Company, Ltd.; Puna Sugar Com
pany, Ltd.; Olaa Sugar Company, Ltd."
"Had you anything to do with the for
mation of these companies other than
Olaa?"
"I was the promoter of all but one."
"Who are the officers of Olaa Sugar
Company?"
"The officers for 1900 are:
i2 A. THURSTON President
H. P. BALDAVIN Vice President
J. B. CASTLE Treasurer
ELMER E. PAXTON Auditor
"Will you pleas^ state briefly, Mr. Dil
lingham, what work has been done on
Olaa plantation since it was started, and
also give an outline of the financial status
of the company as it was, say July 1,
and as it would be if your bond, proposi
tion is carried out as you propose?"
"The property of this company Is situ r
ated in the District of Olaa, Island of
Hawaii. The land is an oblong strip
about four miles wide and fifteen miles
long. Its northeastern extremity, where
the mill Is in course of construction, is
about nine miles from Hilo, the principal
seaport, and lies at an elevation of about
200 feet above sea level, rising gently to
an elevation of 2000 feet In fifteen milea.
"The company was organized and in
corporated under the laws of the republic
of Hawaii in 1899.
"Manager F. B. McStocker assumed the
duties of manager and commenced work
at the plantation July 1, 1899. It is doubt
ful if any plantation ever started in that
country could at the end of twelve months
show better or even as good results ftr
the time employed and money expended.
A careful perusal of the manager's re
port for the first six months ending De
cember 31, 18S9, shows the enormous
amount of work performed to that date
and a detailed account of the money ex
pended. The work during the following
six months, to July 1, 1900, gives assur
ance that the management may reason
ably expect the maiden crop of this com
pany will fully equal their most sanguine
expectations; for 4500 acres of well ma
tured cane. At that date the company

Hearing that B. F. Dillir.gham of Hono

tel, si Chronicle reporter called upon him
and made an appointment for an extended
interview, with the following result:
"Knowing, Mr. Dniingham, that you
have been a. successful promoter of a
large number of the best sugar producing
estates in Hawaii, the Chronicle is desir
ous cf laying before its readers and the
investing public as much reliable informa
tion as possible. Is it true that you are

"Yes, an opportunity is now given to the
Investing; public of San Francisco to get
in on the "STOund floor' in the largest and
one of the very best undertakings in the
production of tugar ever inaugurated in
the Territory of Hawaii."
"V>*ill you state, Mr. Dillingham, what
you have done upon the island of Oahu,
on which Honolulu, the capital, is situ
ated?"
"Since January 1. 1??<\ I have promoted
'a whole or in part the following enter
prises on Oahu, which were taken up al
most entirely by Hawaiian capital, name
ly: Oahu Railway and Land Company.
Ewa Plantation Company, Ltd., Kahuka
Sugar Company. Ltd., Oahu Sugar Com
pany, Ltd., Honolulu Sugar Company,

S12.000.OOI). The market value to-day In
Honolulu and San Francisco of the bonds
and flocks of the above named corpora
tions is over SJfl.O90.O00.**
"It is reported, Mr. Dillingham, that you
ere building a railroad on the Island of
Hawaii, end are also interested in the
development of the new plantations there.
Will you kindly state in a general way
what has been done?"
"In 1898 1 associated myself with L. A.
TbUTStOO. A. W. Carter. M. P. Robinson
and others, who together organized the
Hilo Railroad Company.- and on the 2Mb
of March of that year were granted by tho
Government of the republic of Hawaii
a franchise for a term of fifty years for
the purpose Â« f constructing sfteam or elec
tric railroads on any part of the island
of Hawaii and for transacting any and
ell business Incidental or relating thereto.
"The Island of Hawaii has an area of
4000 square milos and lies in a southeaster- ;
ly direction from Honolulu, about 500 |
rhilf-s distant. Hilo, the principal port of 1
entry on that island, has a large harbor
ond "is an ambitious rival of the city of
Honolulu.
Hilo Kailroad Company.
"The promoters of the Hilo Railroad
Company acquired the control by pur
chase and under long leases of about 35.000
acres of the finest sugar land on the isl
and of Hawaii. These lands are situated
in the districts of Olaa and Puna, in a
southeasterly direction from Hilo.
"Two sugar plantations have been orga- |
nized and incorporated under the laws of
the republic of Hawaii, taking over those
valuable lands under the names of Olaa
Sugar Company. Limited, and Puna Sugar
Company. Limited. The mill site for the
IirFt named plantation is nine miles and
the latter twenty-seven miles from the
water front of Hilo harbor.
"A standard gauge road (four feet eight

Water Supply.
"No artiticial irrigation will be required
for this plantation. The average rainfall
exceeds 109 inches. In no other section of
the country is the rainfall more evenly
distributed. There is no record of a
drought in Olaa sufficient to affect vege
tation. Independent of the local rainfall
the company has recently discovered sub- j
terrancan streams lying near the surface
cf the ground at an elevation varying
from 3650 to 2CÂ«iO feet above sea level,
which, at small expense in tunneling, have
been brought out upon the surface and are
under the control of the company. There
are now five streams developed, flowing
by actual measurement 16,000,000 gallons
a. day of twenty-four hours. The cheapest
means known for the transportation of
cane from field to mill is by water run In
a V-shaped flume, but this method is used
by a small percentage of all the planta
tions In the country, for the reason that
water for that purpose Is not available.
The water already developed (which, if
desired, can be enormously increased) is
ample to supply ail requirements for mill
ing purposes and to convey to the mill in
flumes enough cane to manufacture 400
tons of sugar per day. Should water ever
bÂ« needed for irrigation on Olaa this and
the undeveloped sources can be made to
eupply every possible need.
Olaa Within a Natural Rain Belt.
"North and west of Olaa are the snow
capped mountains of Mauna Kea and
Manna Loa respectively. The clouds from
over the ocean, carried by prevailing
Â¦winds between those lofty mountains,
Â¦whose summit peaks rise nearly 14,000 feet
above the sea level, meet in their passage
there the cold condensing temperature
and they are speedily brought to earth in
torrents of rain. This natural condition
may furnish a satisfactory explanation
lor the fact that the district of Olaa was
y:ever known to suffer from drouzht."
"Is it not possible, Mr. Dillingham, that
there is too much rainfall In Olaa for
cane?"
"No; I th!nk not. and my views upon
this point are fully sustained by ail the
best authorities. The strongest reply I
can make to this question Is to furnish
Vou with a copy of Mr. Thurston'a letter
to Messrs. Moir and Walton, and their re
ply, which may also be found printed in
full In the prospectus of the Olaa Sugar
Company, Limited, copies of which, to
pether with the lirst annual report, can

PAHALA. KAU, Hawaii. March 2S,
' 1 1KWâ L. A. Thurston and Associatesâ Dear
i Sirs: Your favor of March L'2 duly re
. ceived. By your request 1 have visited
I and personally Inspected a large tract of
i land in OlAa, between the thirteenth and
I twenty-second mile posts, intended to be
i used by you for a i-ugar plantation.
Character of Soil.
| The soil is a deep, mellow loam, Jnto
which a stick may easily be pushed by
hand to a. depth of several feet.
The greater part Of me tract is entirely
) free from stones or rocks: the remainder
i being slightly mixed with loose a-a, which
i is In no way detrimental to the growth
j of caneâ rather benelicial than otherwise.
That the soil is wonderfully fertile is
I proved by the dense growth of vegetation
now on the land and ny the rapidity with
which a piece of land will again cover
Itself with vegetation after being cleared.
In fact: for fertility I do Dot think the
equal of this land can be fount! on Hawaii.
Absence of Gulches and Stones.
Owing to the absence of gulches and
hills in the contour of the lands and of
rocks and the stones in the soil, the plan
tation can be very easily laid out and
worked.
Roads.
There are several macadamized roads at
j present crossing the lands, making the
j fieWs easy of access. The Volcano road
j also runs directly through them.
Climate.
The temperature seems to be consider
ably higher than in the Kau district at.the
same elevation, and there is an absence
of cold night winds.
The rainfall is great, ranging from 150
to ISO inches per year; but owing to the
a-a subsoil the water quickly disappears.
In fact, a few minutes after a heavy rain
there is very little water to be seen.
i Growth of Cane.
I have examined cane in several locali
ties on these lands. At an" elevation of
2000 feet we were shown cane which at an
age of ten months from planting could be
trashed to a height of over four feet by
actual measurement.
Although in the winter season, seed
planted two months ago is now up to a
height of seven to ten inches and looks
healthy and strong.
The canes se*>n were of the rose bamboo
and yellow Caledonia varieties. These
varieties have been grown in Kau for
years at an elevation of 2150 feet, yielding
at times five tons and over of sugar per
acre. During the last twenty months we
have planted to a height of 2550 feet and
have the promise of a good crop.
Water Supply.
In several places we found small
streams of water c,oming from the ground,
and believe that water can be found in
sufficient quantities to be of great assist
ance in transporting the cane to the mill
and for use in the mill and boiling house.
Estimated Yield.
In my opinion these lands should pro
duce a yield of from five to seven tons of
I sugar per acre, which should be kept up
for a long time, owing :o the great deptn
and fertility of the soil. Yours very truly,
C. M. WALTON.

REPORT OF JOHN MOIR. MANAGER
ONOMEA SUGAR COMPANY, ON
OLAA LANDS.
Mr. Moir is a Scotchman. He has been
eleven years In the country, all of which
has been spent on sugar plantations in
the HIlc district. He was successively an
'Â¦ overseer on the Waiakea and Ililo plan
: tations. and in 1890 became head overseer
at Onomea, which position he held until
1826. when he became manager of the
Honomu plantation. When Mr. Goodale 'Â¦
was appointed manager of Waialua last
fall Mr. Moir succeeded him as manager
of Onomea, the largest plantation in Ililo. :
Mr. Moir is one of the leading minds in
the executive control of the sugar bus
iness. No man in the country is more
competent to express a practical opinion j
concerning any detail of the sugar bus
' n pAPAIKOU, Hilo, Hawaii, March 2S,
lSy9.â Mr. L. A. Thurston and othersâGen
tlemen: Your favor of March 22 duly to
h-tnd. relative to sugar plantation in Oiaa. ;
At your request I have personally in
spected those lands pointed out to me as
the land? you and several other gentlemen
have options on in view of making a sugar
plantation.
Soil.
In all my experience (which extends
over eleven years in the district of Hilo)
I have never seen finer soil for raising
sugar. The depth of the soil is slmply
wonderful. It seems as though there was I
no end to it. You can take a stick two I
inches in diameter and push it down from
four to six feet without meeting any re
sistance. There are very few rocks to be
iound, and the few that are found are
loose a-a, which are rather preferable
than otherwise.
The condition of the soil is the finest
that could be wished for. being bo mellow
and oi-er. that although It rains quite
often and very heavily at times it does not
chew the least sign of being soggy and
wtt The soil being the a-'a formation the
rain disappears very rapidly, but the
land Â»s so mellow that it retains a large
percentage of moisture.
Fertility of Soilâ Estimated Yield.
In my estimation these lands will pro
duce from five to six tons of sugar rigiit Â¦
along without the least strain. I consider '
this a very conservative estimate, as I
have never seen richer soil anywhere on '
these islands.
Climate.
Climatic conditions in Olaa, in my opin- <
Ion, for raising sugar cane, could "not be i
improved upon. The rainfall in some dis- ;
iricts would be too much, but not so here, j
The land is so mellow and being of the !
a-a formation, the rain quickly disappears
from the surface, and there being very I
little wind the soil retains the moisture. *
The Olaa district compares very favor
ably with the Hilo district at the same
elevation. The land that I have examined
lies between the thirteenth mile on the
volcano read to the twenty-second mile
on the same road, and, in my opinion, is
all very suitable -for cane.'
Growing Cane. ,
At "Linders." at 3000 feet elevation,
there is cane to be seen measuring from
four to seven feet, grown in ten months,
and measuring over two inches in diam
eter. Practically the same may be seen i
at P. Peck's at 1900 feet elevation; the :
variety of can* spoken of and most fa
vored is Rose Bamboo, but Yellow Cale- i
donia comes in a good second. That :
growth of cane in the time mentioned ;
above is by far and away ahead of any- â¢
thing that has ever come under my ob- :
servat'on in all my experience. 1
The nge of the cane is vouched for by
Mr. Lmder. whom I am personally &c- J
quainted with. I have every reason to be- i
lieve that he tells the truth. 1
Finally, in my opinion, a sugar planta- 1
tlon can be established and conducted 1
very profitably on the 10,000 acres which i
you have options on, with a conservative |
estimate oÂ£ an average yearly output of
Work Accomplished on the Various
Plantations and Proposed
Improvements.
NEW SUGAR INDUSTRIES
IN HAWAIIAN ISLANDS
lime, potash and phosphoric acid contents
are moderately good, while the nitrogen is
high.
i The soils of the middle altitudes are high
in lime, good in potash, moderate in phos
phoric acid and high in nitrogen.
The higher altitude soils are very high
In lime, high in potash, moderate In phos
phoric acid and high in nitrogen.
Considering the high contents of organic
matter in these soils, due to large rainfall,
It was expected that they would be very
sour. All the samples have an acid reac
tion, and the application of a small dose
of burnt lime v.lll be of immediate use.
The soils, however, are not sour soils (ex
cepting small wet holes where excess ot
organic matter has rotted), and this free
dom from sourness is due to the high con
tent of lime and to the excellent drainage.
In considering climatic conditions the
chief factor in the present case is tem
perature, since the rainfall Is. and appar
ently always will be, abundant. The
Mauna coffee plantation (Mr. Peck) fur
nishes the maximum and minimum read
ings for the years 1S9G-97-9S and part of
1M>9, at the elevation of 1SO0 to 200*3 feet.
The results are found as follows:
Average night temperature for three years.63.7
Average day temperature for three years. ..80.7
.Mean temperature for the three years 72.2
Annual mean temperature in Honolulu 74.0
Ihe lowest night temperature recorded
in the said Olaa locality during the three
years was 6 degrees above the lowest
temperature recorded in Honolulu. The
present special characteristic of the tem
perature in the uiaa district is Its uni
tormity. The removal of forest on a large
scale may result in decreasing the day
temperatures and slightly lowering the
night readings.
'Ihe relation of the soil to the varia
tions in the air temperature Is an impor
tant factor. During the night of May 15,
when these examinations were being
made, a thermometer was buried in the
soil to a depih of six inches. The pre
v.ous <1ay temperature was 78 degrees.
The night v.-as very cool, the air lalling
to 5S degrees, but. the thermometer in tho
soil at 7:40 did not fall below 63 degrees,
boils of a different nature would have
given up their heat to a greater degree to
the cool night air. It is thus indicated
that the uniformity of the air tempera
tures, with the moist heat of the days,
and the power of the soil to retain heat,
will be ample guarantee of the iitness of
the conditions for cane culture, which fit
ness is supported by the cane in different
localities now growing. Yet it will prob
ably be found that the cane at the high
est altitudes will require more time to ma
ture than at lower levels.
Considered as a whole, the proposition
of the Olaa Sugar Company, by reason of
its magnitude, is very impressive, and the
extent of the lands, with the nature of the
soils and the apparent fitness of the cli
mate, promise for the enterprise a great
future. WALTER MAXWELL.
"You have stated, Mr. Dillingham, that
the Olaa Sugar Company, Ltd., is capital
ized at $5,000,000 and that the company
owns in fee and control under lease and
otherwise over 20.000 acres of land. May
I ask what was paid for the land?"
"Fully paid up stock to the amount of
$2,500,000 at its par value."
"What about the other $2,500,000 of
capital stock?" \
"That represents the cash capital paid
and to be paid to the company for the
development of the land to a 40,000 or
50.000 ton capacity."
"How much has been called in thus
far?"
"Sixty-five per cent of $1,250,000â say
$512,500. or 32%. per cent of the whole
amount of assessable stock."
"During what period of time has this
amount been called in?" s
"About one year."
"How much money will be required dur
ing the next twelve months?"
"About $1,250,000. during which time the
mill, now being landed at Hilo. will be
set up and paid for at a cost of $550,000."
"I understand you have about $1,250,000
yet to call in besides the 35 per cent on
$1,250,000. say $437,500. due and payable at
the call of the company."
"That- Is correct."
"Is there any truth in the statement
that you are thinking of making an issue
of bonds on the Olaa Sugar Company,
Ltd.?"
"Yes, the stockholders have decided to
make an issue of 6 per cent first mort
gage 5-20-year gold coupon bonds, to be
secured by a deed of trust covering the
entire present anÂ«l prospective property
of the company. The total issue of bonds
will not exceed $1,500,000, and probably not
more than $1,250,000."
"Do you expect to place all the bonds in
this market?"
"No. we expect to place a large amount
in Honolulu. Such Investments are in de
mand there tor trust funds, and will
doubtless meet with special favor now for
two reasons: First, the company will of
fer the bonds at par, giving the investors
the privilege of exchanging the bonds at
par for stock at par at any time on or be
fore January l, 1902. at which time the
maiden crop will begin to be harvested,
covering an area of 4500 acres, which at a
low yield of live and a half tons per acre,
or a fraction more, will give 25.000 tons.
With sugar at $20 per ton below the pres
ent price, there will be a profit of $750,000,
or 15 per cent upon the entire capital stock
of $5,000,000. The second reason why the
bonds will be sought after in Honolulu is
that the Hawaiian Government 6 per cent
bonds will soon be taken up by the Gov
ernment at Washington, and nearly $3,000,
000 of those bonds are held In Hawaii, and
the money, when paid, will seek another
home investment."
"Will the public of this city have an op
portunity to get in on the 'ground floor'
with the island people?"
"Yes, we intend to offer a portion of the
bonds to the public of this city, upon the
terms I have already named, and I am
free to say in this connection that no bet
ter or safer investment, in my opinion,
has ever been offered in any property in
the Territory of Hawaii."
"Was not the land tu-ned in to the com
pany at a rather high ligure. giving the
original promoters too much profit?"
"As I am one of the promoters. I am
possibly a little prejudiced, but I don't
think the promoters received more than
half as much as they were entitled to,
viewing the business from the usual pro
motion standpoint, considering that they,
the promoters, put up a very largo
amount in United States Bold coin for the
land acquired for the company, taking
stock for every dollar so invested, besides
subscribing to over 20 per cent of the as*
sessable stock, paying therefor the same
price per share as the buyer of one single
share. Those promoters, now large stock
holders, are now proposing to turn over
all the property of the plantation thus far
acquired as security for a mortgage upon
which to raise about one-third of the
amount they have advanced and allow
the purchasers of bonds to thus secure a
good G per cent investment and the privi
lege of exchanging such investment for
stock in the company when it will have
become dividend paying, and upon as fa
vorable terms as was granted to the'orig
inal stockholders whose investment will
have been held by them without earnings
for a period of nearly two years. I know
of no enterprises promoted elsewhere In
the world on such a basis."
"Then you don't feel quit* Fatisfled, Mr.
Dillingham, with your deal?"
"Certainly I do or I would not have
taken it up. I was simply replying to
your query about promotion profits, but
the best answer I can give any one as to
the value of land and the stock of Olaa
Sugar Company as an investment is to
refer you. to the comparative table show
ing the value of lands per acre In the

of Hawaii. This table was made up from
the Tax Assessor's books, and verified at
the offices of the agents In Honolulu, and
hence may be safely accepted as correct:

REPORT OF J. T. MOIR ON KEAAU
LANDS.
PAPAIKOU, Hilo, Hawaii, March 29,
1899.â To L. A. Thurston and others^ â Gen
tlemen: Your favor of March 22 duly re
ceived, relating to a sugar proposition in
Keaau. district of Puna, -island of Ha
waii, for which purpose you hold options
on several thousand acreg.
At your request I have personally ex
amined these lands as to their adaptabil
ity for sugar cane.
Soil â I examined the soil very thorough
ly and found it very rich." The a-a lands
are extremely rich, with a depth of soil
of from twelve inches to two or three feet,
exaetly similar in every respect to the
best Waiakea lands, than which there is
none better in the district. Pahoehoe (or
flat rock) crops out here and there on tho
surface on what is called the Pahoehoe
lands (or flat rock lands), but take It on
an average right through there is eight
to eighteen inches of very rich black soil
of the very best quality.
Climatic conditions are just right for
cane and rainfall plentiful, as shown by
Waiakea plantation close by. Most of the
land is covered with guava bushes and
heavy ferns, which indicates fertile soil.
The elevation of these lands runs from
100 to SOO feet. In my opinion these lands
would raise cane, and be a very profitable
investment. There is not the slightest
doubt in my mind that cane raised on
these lands will yield from five to six tons
of sugar per acre. I remain, most respect
fully yours, JOHN T. MOIR.
(A report on the Keaau land, similar in
character to the above, was received from
Mr. Walton, but it has been mislaid.)
ANALYSIS OF OLAA CANE, BY E.

OPINION OF DR. MAXWELL.
The above analysis has been submitted
to Dr. Maxwell and he authorizes the
promoters to quote him as saying that
"it indicates a cane of a very high qual
ity."
When the above letters were written
it was proposed to purchase 10,000 acres.
But the quality of soil and climatic con
ditions were so favorable that the area
was increased to, 20,000 acres.
Professor Walter Maxwell, who has for
a number of years been the director of
the Hawaiian Sugar Experiment Sta
tion and laboratories at Honolulu, and
who is one of the leading authorities of
the world upon the subject of sugar cane
and soil analysis in connection therewith,
after personal examination and analysis
of soils of this plantation, made the fol
lowing report:
REPORT OF DR. WALTER MAXWELL
ON SOILS OF OLAA PLANTATION
COMPANYâ REPORT ON SOILS.
The lands embraced by the Olaa Plan
tation Company are found in two sep
arate and large sections, viz.: "Keaau"
and "Olaa."
A.â Keaau:â The lands of this eection,
due to the differences in the soils, have to
be considered- in two or three classes:
U) Keddish Soils Free from Stone.
These soils are located at an elevation of
200 feet and upwards. These lands em
brace about SOU acres, much of which is
covered with rich, heavy, growths of
fruava, ferns, etc., but few trees. As in
dicated, the soil3 are reddish in color;
of good depth and resting upon a deep
subsoil free from stone.
The chemical composition shown is as
follows:

PÂ«-r Ct. Per Ct. Per Ct. Per Ct. Per Ct. Per Ct.
SO. 70 2i.:0 P.1S5 0.231 0.371 0.672
These data will be considered in later
remarks.
CD "AA" Soils. The lands of this tract,
like those of the former tract, are fine
breadths of undulating ground, free from
ijuiehes, but in parts somewhat stoi^y.
A rich growth of vegetation covers al
most the whole of it. The soils are a veg
etable mold to a depth of from twelve to
twenty inches, and this rests upon an
open â¢ < aa" subsoil of good depth and po
rousness. These lands and soil closely
resemble those of the Waiakea planta
tion. In small patches upon this tract of
"aa" soils, which comprises over 2000
acres, pahoehoe soils are found. These
patches, however, comprise only a few
acres or the tract.
The analyses of the respective soils are
as follows:

B.â Olaa Sectionâ This section covers
such an extensive area that, at rirst view,
it appears impracticable to consider it as
a whole. The superficial survey of the
lands, with a very careful examination of
i the character and depth of the soil in the
several widely distributed localities,
showed, however, that practically only
one character ot soil was to be dealt with,
and this tact caused the examinations and
soil analysis to be based chlelly upon the
j fact of altitude.
(1) Lower Altitudes â This division was
represented in the examinations by the
lands surrounding the "Halfway House,"
the samples of soil being taken from the
tracts owned by Peter Lee and others, at
about 1000 to 11U0 feet.
These lands are composed of fine, level
breadths, covered with rich vegetation,
chiclly of undergrowth. The soils are
deep and porous and overlie very porous
subsoils. The analysis gives as follows:
Soluble Organic Phosphoric
Matter. Matter. Lime. Potash. Acid. Nitrogen.
Per Ct. Per Ct. Per Ct. Per Ct. Per Ct. Per Ct.
81. Â£9 29.41 0.271 0.272 0.2JS 0.724
(2) Middle Altitudesâ The lands In
cluded within this division comprise the
I areas reaching from 1300 to 1800 feet, .with
I "Mountain View" (1500 feet) as the center.
Most of these lands are spread out In very
level breadths hundreds of acres in size.
Excepting very small patches, such as are
found about one mile up the so-called
"Xew Road" (1400 feet elevation) are areas
free from rock, but covered with a dense
ly rich growth of timber and underbrush.
The soils are very deep, and unusually
porous to a depth of several feet. The
analysis of the soils In this division gave
an average as follows:
Soluble Organic Phosphoric
Matter. Matter. LJme. Potash. Acid. Nitrojren.
Per-Ct. Per Ct. Per Ct. Per Ct. Per Ct. Per Ct.
73. 6S 26. SS 0.700 0.340 0.217 0.646
(3) Higher Altitudes â The areas at these
hiRiiest elevations, ranging- at from ISoy to
22UQ feet above sea level, comprise lands in
every feature similar to those of the mid
dle altitudes. "With the exception t of
some limited portions, the same deep, por
ous soils are found, overlying very open
subsoils. The uncleared areas are cover
ed with dense vegetation, the Joint product
of a rich soil and heavy rainfall. The soil
analysis gave as follows:

C5.06 19. S5 1.410 0.454 0.204 0.5S2
REMARKS.
In the Keaau section three types of soil
have been examined: (a) The "reddish"
soils,, although of good depth, are not
high in the elements of plant food except
ing nitrogen. The phosphoric acid is good
but the potash, and more especially the
lime, is low. (b) the "aa" and "pahoehoe"
soils, which compose the chief areas of
this section, are nigh In lime, potash and
nitrogen, and moderately good in phos
phoric acid. These soils are of high fer
tility, and this will be durable, on account
of the amounts of the elements contained
in the small stones in the "aa" soils
which will gradually be released and made
available for the growing crops. The Olaa
section, as already remarked, comprises
large areas of level, fine-lying lands, and
whose soils are of great depth and porous
ness. This porousness Is a guarantee of
perfect drainage, but it is also a factor
which will cause to be required a most
Judicious and scientific system of fertlliza- I
tion in order to avoid loss. of applied fer
tilizers and to maintain fertility. So far
the leaching action of heavy rains has
been retarded by the heavy undergrowths
and the large content of humus and or
ganic matter in the surface soil.

look into the smallpox conditions after
a week's absence. This afternoon he said:
"After having -visited Jackson the second

ST. LOUIS, July 14.â A special to the
Post-Dispatch from New London, Mo.,
says: The last person who ever talked
with Gilbert W. Gates, as far as known,
save Alexander Jester himself, was placed
on the stand to-day. Ills name Is A. W.
Qassett, and he resides near Mlddlegrove.
where the young man so mysteriously
disappeared In 3871. The two travelers
stopped at the Bassett farm and bought
feed for the teams. This was the day fol
lowing tho night when " Jester choked
Gates, who told him that he had been
out West and was going home, and that
ho did not like to travel with Jester be
cause he was so crabbed.
Ex-Governor Johnson, for the prosecu
tion, said to-day that the State's theory
for Gate's' failure to leave Jester after the
choking was that he had 110 opportunity
to. do so. A. Gates, the father, had this
to say on that point:
"I believe Jester made my son believe
he was dreaming when he choked him.
and as Gilbert knew he would soon be in
Paris, Mo., he thought he would continue
to travel Â¦ with Jester until he reached
that point." '
The appearance of Alexander Jester is
more cheerful since the arrival of his
daughter, Alice Kimbrough, from' Okla
homa. She is the youngest of his large
family, and is disposed to stand by her
father. Shortly after coming into court
to-day Jester remarked that he "liked
the looks of the Jury."
Captain Hugh Stewart testified that he
and his wife were riding horseback on
tho road leading from Middlegrove to
Paris, Mo., one day in January, 1S71.-
They saw a pool of blood in the snow in
the middle of what is known as Hulln's
Lane. The pool was fresh. The witness
saw numerous spots of blood as he pro
ceeded along the road. "When near the
mouth of Hulin's Lanei Mr. and Mrs.
Stewart saw a colored man named Wil
liam Maxey and Tom Teaford, who had
just previously met two wagons and their
driver. Alexander Jester.
When Mr. and Mrs. Stewart arrived at
that point Jester and the two wagons
were about half way to, the Hulln house,
the witness said. The nearest timber
from the pool of blood was in a southeast
erly direction,, and Jester with the two
wagons and teams tied together went as
quickly and as directly as he could to this
It is the theory of the State that tb e
corpse of young Gates was in one of tHe
wagons at the time.

YOUNG GATES
DID NOT TRUST
SEATTLE, .Wash., July 14.-The City of
Topeka arrived in port this evening from
Lynn canal with between $600,000 and ?7a0,
000 of gold dust, all of which is from the
Klondike, bringing its total output since
its discovery in 1896 up to $50,000,000. On
board the Topeka was George Carmack,
famous as the man who first found the
seemingly inexhaustible storehouse of
treasure, and Clarence Berry, the Klon
dike king, both with large amounts of the
yellow dust.
AVhile a number of ships have brought
greater quantities of sold down from the
Klondike this season, the Topeka had on
board a. greater number or individual
holdings than any previous vessel. Of the
seventy-live passengers who came out
from the great northern camp nearly all
had fortunes in dust, ranging all the way
up to $100,000 each. Berry and J. Rowan,
both of the El Dorado district, were the
only two perhaps who had more than this.
Purser Jones of the Topeka gave it as
his opinion that the steamer brought down
'Â¦ at r least $1,000,000, but the more conserva
tive miners thought that $750,000 was
nearer the mark. As George Carmack
had taken Dawson bank drafts for a por
tion of the yield of his mines. Discovery
No 1 above and No. 1 below Bonanza, he
had not as much treasure with him as
several of his fellow passengers. All of
his properties are immensely rich, as are
also those owned on Bonanza by his
brother-in-law, Skookum Jim, and
Tagish Charley, his nephew by marriage.
Although Carmack and Berry have im
mense wealth, it would be hard to find
two more quiet or more unassuming men.
The other heaviest gold passengers on
thÂ° Topeka are Joseph Lonouette, a
Frenchman of Williams, Colusa County,
Cal.: George Butter Jr.. J. C. Williams,
-Charles B. Clark. J. Rouck Mrs. McKtn
non W. S. Godman, C. D. Taylor, Eddie
Lewin and G. W. F. Johnson.
This is Lonouette's llrst visit to the
States since he reacned the Klondike al
most immediately after its discovery. He
has a large fortune with him. Lewin also
has a big load of treasure with him which
he made partly In business at Dawson and
in mining. He resided for a number of
years In Seattle and hua many friends
here. "â¢':, , .
The Topeka's safe was filled from top
to bottom with gold sacks, although about
thirty of the passengers kept their treas
ure In the staterooms. As the miners
staggered ashore with their heavy bur
dens of dust, some being met by joyful
friends and relatives, it was plainly evi
dent that the amount of dust credited to
the ship had not been exaggerated. Tho'
miners themselves wero glad to get back
to civilization and made no effort to con-
Nearly all of the Topeka's Klondike pas
sengers came up the river on the steamer
Yukoner to White Horse. There they took
Â¦the -White Pass and Yukon Railroad to
Caribou, where they boarded a lake
steamer for Bennett, at the latter point
taking to the railroad again, going thence
to Skaguay and there boarding the To
peka for Seattle.
The Yukoner left Dawson July 3. Her
passengers, 175 all told, had a combined
gold cargo, it is estimated, materially in
excess of a ton. â¢. *:\

TRAIN ROBBER BARNES'
CHANGE OF ATTITUDE
Now Claims That He Confessed Sim
ply to Allay the Fears
of His Wife.
ST. LOUIS, July 14.â The police have not
yet captured John Nelson, the alleged
train robber, who escaped from their
clutches yesterday. Requisition papers
for Charles Barnes are expected on Sun
day and he will be taken on Monday to
Wickcllffe, Ky.. to stand trial.
At the instance of Percival Adams, his
St. Louis attorney, Barnes has refused
to sisrn the supposed confession he made
to Chief of Detectives Desmond, Implicat
ing Nelson and Conley. He now says that
he was not implicated In the robbery at
all and that he made the statement to the
chief of detectives merely to allay the
fears of his wife for the time being. Mrs.
Nelson has been released by the police
and has disappeared irom her boardine
place.
The condition of Murray, the Illinois
Central detective, who was shot by Nel
son, is Improved. It is probable that he
will be able to resume his duties in a few
days.

tue of the agreement now proclaimed, piv

JOIIX HAY, Secretary of State.
Setback for Meat BilL
The proclamation does not recite the
terms of the agreement. It Is said each
CJovermnent will proclaim only such fea
tures of the arrangement as are neces
sary for the guidance of its own officials
in administering. The arrangement itself
will not be made public at present. The
putting into operation of the German meat
bill is deferred for an indefinite period.
The official explanation is that the pur
pose of its suspension is simply to allow
f.f the execution of existing contracts held
by American meat packers. It is not dis
coverable just now whether or not this
moat act figures in any way in the reci
procity agreement, and it may be. and
probably iÂ«, the fact that suspension has
lx?en arranged for separately;
The reciprocity agreement appears to be
the result of sharp diplomatic maneuver
ing over a period of several years on the
meaning: of the "favored nation" clause.
Germany formerly had only one tariff
schedule for all nations, but in the years
preceding 18.02 seven reciprocity treaties
were made, with Austria-Hungary, Rus
sia. Italy. Belgium. Rouraanla and some
other countries. These gave a preferen
tial tariff to the countries mentioned, in
return for concessions allowed Ger
many. Germany made no reciprocity
treaty with the United States, but under
the "most favored nation" clause of the
'> general treaty between this country and
Germany it "was held that the United
States was entitled to the same prefer-
I ential tariff rates allowed by Germany to
] Russia. Italy and the other countries men-
When, therefore, the United States gave
I reciprocity reductions to France, the Ger
i man authorities asked for similar reduc
tions under the "favored nation' clause,
I and. as evidence of the Justice of their
> request they pointed to the fact that the
I United States was getting the preferential
duties from Germany through the oper
ation of the "favored nation" clause.
1 Moreover it is probable that if the Lnited
i States had not given Germany the same
i reduction allowed to France, the German
! preferential tariff. Including the Lnlted
I States with Russia. Italy. Austria, etc.,
i would have been withdrawn. It was.
therefore, settled that the German nrefer
' entlal rates would be confirmed by the
I I'nited States and that the United States
i would Rive Germany the same tariff re
i ductions already accorded France, Italy
and Portugal.
WASHINGTON, July 14.â The following
proclamation by the' President on the Ger
many reciprocity agreement has been
made public:
Reciprocity with Germany. By the President
of the United States of Americaâ A proclama
tion:

THE SECRET OF OUR SUCCESS.
Many physicians, after they have experimented with their patient
until he ia on the verso of the srrave. call a. consultation pZ other doc-
tors We take the opposite course and hold a consultation whrn a cura
Is undertaken. This gives the patient the benefit of the kTiowledge or
five skilled specialists and insures a quick and permanent cure.
People frequently wonder at the results accomplished by our institu-
tion The reason for our many marvelous cures, however, Is easily ex-
plained To begin with merit wins. Take, for example, a stor<Â» which
never misrepresents an article or sell3 It for more than Us value and
cives each patron courteous treatment. That firm is recognized as re-
liable and worthy of the patronage of the public. On the other hand,
if a merchant makes false statements about his wares, charges exorbi-
tant prices and does not aim to please his customers he soon fa.Is. Peo-
ple are prone to talk of such matters, and an 111 word travels mora
SWl ln y S ome n r a es S P Â°e O cL 0 ouV methods may be likened to those of the suc-
cessful merchant, but the comparison is more favorable. \ve give out-
patients something that cannot be obtained elsewhere on the racÂ© or iixo
globe, viz. : Remedies and methods that cure. .
When we commenced our professional career, nearly twenty years
a~o we were alive to the fact that It was best, both from a business
and' a humanitarian point of view, to cure our patients so that thay
would stay cured; to do it 0.3 quickly as possible, and at reasonable
prices. In carrying out this laudable purpose- we have succeeded bÂ«-
yoiid our most sanguine expectations.
We have made the name of our institution famous by curing contracted
ailments, lost manhood, varicocele, stricture, rupture and diseases of the
bladder, kidneys, heart, spine, etc.
Our business Is Increasing every year. Our Institution Is the lars-Â«
est and best equipped, and our practice tho most extensive.
TERMS AND PRICES FOR PERMANENT CURES.

dies and- appliances may deposit the price of a cure in any bank in San
Francisco. If a cure is not effected in a reasonable time the bank will
return the money. Payments may be made in monthly installments if
preferred. Prices reasonable alike to rich end poor.

They were constantly quarreling, and
yesterday afternoon Denneman hit Kehoe
on the head with a hammer, knocking

skull might be fractured. There was
also an abrasion and contusion on his

Fire Commissioners Protest to Board
of Supervisors Against Objec
tionable Order.
The Board of Fire Commissioners filed
a protest yesterday against the recent
resolution of the Board of Supervisors
directing the former body to pay for Its
own stationery and printing supplies. The
Commissioners contend that the cost of
such supplies is not legally chargeable
against their appropriation according to
the provisions of the charter, as outlined
in Friday's Call.
"For these reasons," the protest con
cludes, "it has never been supposed by
us that we would have to pay for these
supplies, and in making our estimate of
supplies for the current fiscal year we
did not include the item of stationery, as
you and the Auditor are aware. Inasmuch
as w r e were allowed an/appropriation no
greater than is absolutely required for
the department, we think it would be a
great injustice if our expenditures are
to be increased by the unexpected item
of the cost of stationery supplies."

Custom-house experts were considerably
agitated yesterday over the' receipt by
Customs Collector Jackson of a circular
from the Secretary of the Treasury call
ing his attention to the following regula
tion: '
For th* frfe entry of articles imported for the
use of colleges, etc.. affidavit must be made
within yeven days before their arrival by the
secretary or treasurer or other responsible offi
cer of the institution, under its corporate seal,
that such articles have been imported by the
order and for the sole Â«use of said institution,
and not for sale or distribution.
Brokers are aaklng one another as to
the possibility of guessing the time of the
arrival of a sailing vessel from Eurone
by way of Cape Horn, for instance, witli
in seven days. It is no uncommon occur
rence for a sailing vessel on that route
to be nearly one hundred days overdue.
Brokers say that a strict compliance with
the regulation would require college oijl
cers to mak# the affidavit every seven
days until the arrival of the goods, but
they do not think that the Secretary of
the Treasury intended to put this hardship
upon the shoulders of coilege people.
Martin- Hynes, a teamster living at
10 Langton street, was charged in Judge
Fritz's court yesterday with stealing a
street lamp. v the complainant being the
Board of Public Works. The lamp was
on a street obstruction at Ritch and
Brannan streets. Hynes was convicted,
and begged for mercy for the sake of his
wife and children. He said he had taken
the lamp for a joke. He was ordered into
custody until to-morrow, when he will
appear for sentence.

ages for cruelty to members of the crew.
Coombs Will Defend Baker.
The Second Brigade Officer Who Pre
sided Was Lax in His
Duty.
It is evident that some times some of
the officers of the National Guard who are
detailed to preside at an election for com
missioned officers are not always as strict
as they might be, the result being that the
whole business has to be gone over again.
Some time ago there was an election for
officers in one of the local companies of
the Second Brigade and a member of the
brigade staff was detailed to preside. The
election was held, after which it was dis
covered that at the meeting there had not
been as the law requires, present and
voting, a majority of those who would be
entitled to vote. When the .returns had
gone through the many military channels,
it was declared that the election was il
legal and another will have to be ordered.
It Is likely that the officer who shall pre
side next time will make sure that he Is
right before going ahead.
The member? of the Guard are now
waiting for orders that will give them an
opportunity to parade on Admission day
in the big 'turn out. As yet no conclusion
has been reached as to whether the entire
Guard will be brought to this city or
whether only the companies composing
the Second Krigade will be calied out. If
the latter phould be the decision reached
the members of the First Regiment hope
that something will be done, and done
quickly, so as to enable them to make a
creditable appearance.
The companies of the Hfth Infantry
paraded in their respective localities on
the 4th ins=t. and the parade reports
j=how that Company A had a percentage
of seventy-three men in line, B eighty
two, C seventy-six, D seventy-four. E
peventy-four, F seventy-two. G sixty-four,
H eighty-four and I seventy-six. B made
the best showing, turning out flfty-tnree
out of sixty-six men.
Major Hendy has been ordered to pre
side at an election to be held July 26 in
Company G of the Fifth Infantry to fill
vacancies caused by both the first and
second lieutenants failing to qualify.

THE new power works for the Inde
pendent Electric Light and Power
Company was opened on Monday.
Within two weeks the cars on the
San Francisco and San Mateo Railway
and the Pacific Rolling Mills will be oper
ated by electricity generated at the new
plant, and in less than a month the subtle
fluid will be supplied to consumers
throughout the city.
The power works is equipped with the
most modern of mechanical devices.
Every piece of machinery in the building
is duplicated and there will be no possi
bility of a breakdown. Where two en
gines are required to be in constant use
a third is in position ever ready in case
of an emergency. The plans of construc
tion were so made that the plant may be
enlarg-ed upon at any time. Not only
may the amount of machinery be in
creased when demand requires it, but the
buildings themselves can be enlarged
without any change in the original speci
fications.
The power i$ generated by four, large en
gines of the latest pattern. Three of them
have a capacity of 2500 horsepower and
the fourth of 75") horsepower. If required,
the total horsepower of the four engines
can be raided to 12.000. Eight huge boilers
of horsepower each supply the steam.
Petroleum will be used as fuel until the
company can place in. position their new
coal bunkers with a total caoacity of 3000
tone. The coal will be fed to the boilers
by an automatic device.
Work on the building, which was opened
Monday, was commenced on the first day
of December of last year. Wires have
been laid throughout the city since that
time and the system for the. supplying- of
light and power is considered one of the
best. If not the mo?t modern, in the
United States. The trial operation of the
machinery was highly satisfactory and
every wheel in. the immense plant was
running as smoothly as clockwork yester
day.
Those In charj?e-of the new plant are:
A. M. Hunt, manager; Thomas Mirk,
chief engineer, and R. S. Masson, chief
electrician. v

TO EXAMINE POSTAL
AFFAIRS AT MANILA
A case of considerable interest to labor
organizations was decided by Judpe Frita
yesterday. L. Jacoby and others were ar
rested some time ago for carrying banners
in front of a cloak house on Market street
where there was a lockout.
The ordinance under which the arrests
were made make3 it a misdemeanor "to
appear on the streets of the city and,
county of San Francisco carrying ban
ners, boards or placards with advertise
ments; provided, the provisions of this
section shall not apply to notices or ad
vertisements by labor, fraternal or chari
table organizations of their meetings, acts
or other affairs."
It was contended for the defendants that
the ordinance was unconstitutional and
void, as by excepting labor, fraternal or
charitable organizations it Introduced
class legislation. The Judge was there
upon asked to decide whether, the proviso
clause beinp void, the remainder of the or
dinance should stand alone or fall with the
proviso, and the whole ordinance be de
clared unconstitutional and void.
The Judge decided yesterday that the
whole ordinance was unconstitutional and
void. He said: "The court beiieves In this
case that it was the Intention of the Su
pervisors to exempt labor and other or
ganizations from the penalty Imposed by
this act. and that that, body would not
have passed or approved this ordinance
were it to operate against these organiza
tions. Therefore, the prov'so being admit
tedly unconstitutional and void, carries
with it the entire act."
The cases woro therefore dismissed.

to . ~r to the commemoration of the event

The afternoon. Tricolor was everywhere
in evidence, and the gayety was typical of
the gTeat anniversary and the people that
celebrated it. At night there was an elab

'a naval battle on the lake; a concert by
the Chut<*s band, and the grand ball in

entire joyful fete.

The loss of the Biscuit Company will
approximate $30,000. The other concerns
will suffer a loss of several thousand dol
lars each from water. The building ia
owned by the Fair estate, and the dam
age will amount to $25,000.
The firemen worked like Trojans and
soon had a dozen streams playing on the
flames, while tons-of water were being
poured into the building by the water
tower and a standplpe located on the top
of a big building on Pacific street, but
even this immense volume of water had
no perceptible effect on the fire, which
seemed to gather force and headway in
spite of the utmost efforts of the fire
fighters. At 2 a. m. the fire was under
control.
The building was divided into three sec
tions by firewalls and that fact alone pre
vented its total destruction. The fire was
confined to the building occupied by the
Standard Biscuit Company. The center of
the building is occupied by the Florinton
Pulp and Paper Company and the Crowa
Paper Company, while the further end of
the building is occupied by the Gulf Bay
Company and the Saroni candy factory
The fire started in the oven room of the
biscuit factory, on the second story, and
spread ' with amazing rapidity. The bis
cuit factory was soon a seething furnace
but the fire walls saved the rest of the
structure.
The five-story brick building occupied
by the Standard biscuit factory and sev
eral other concerns at the northwest cor
ner of Pacific and Front streets was par
tially destroyed by fire which broke
out a few minutes before 1 o'clock this
morning. The fire was discovered by Po
liceman Buckley, who saw flames issu
ing from the windows of the second story,
and turned in an alarm from box 354, at
the corner of Front and Broadway. The
fire apparatus responded promptly, but
it was at once seen that the small force of
three engines was totally unable to cope
with the conflagration and two more
alarms were turned in. bringing reinforce
ments of a dozen additional engines, sev
eral hook and ladder trucks and water
towers. By this tlma the flames were
spreading- with startling rapaidity and
one end of the structure occupied by the
biscuit company was a roaring furnance.

FEATURES OF THE BIG~ FRENCH FETE AT THE CHUTES.
TWO Nome steamers were In evidence
in the bay yesterday. Strange to
say, one vessel brought home about
fifty disgusted gold hunters, while
the other took away about an equal num
ber of men who are eager to try their
luck in the fever and smallpox-infected
camps spread out between St. Michael
and Cape York.
Every vessel from the far north brings
news -of deaths and lawlessness, and it
seems incredible that at this late day in
the season a steamer should take away
fifty men and women prepared for a win
ter in the frozen north.
The Alaska Commercial Company's St.
Paul sailed from Freemont-street ..wharf
nt 2 p.m. sharp, while the San Jose, un
der charter to the same concern, was
moving up to take the vacated berth. The
8M Paul was loaded down with freight.
Every inch of space was taken up in the
hold, while on deck lumber and perisha
ble goods were piled higher than the rail
ing. â¢ Fifty men and women took passage
on the ex-transport and all of them are
prepared to remain on the ground until
next spring. Captain Hayes expects to
make a quick run north and will only
stop at Unalaska for coal. The vessel is
fully provisioned, as an exodus is expect
ed as soon as the season closes.
The San Jose brought twenty-eight
cabin and thirty-one second cabin pas
sengers . from Cape Nome. Many of
theee were women who could not stand
tho rigors of the camp and who were glad

The San Jose brines the news that the
notorious Wyatt Earp had been shot, but
not fatally wounded, on June 23. Ha
pulled a gun on a man in a saloon, but
the latter was too quick and Earp re
ceived a bullet in his body. The news o{
the shooting comes from ex-Coroner E. E.

Â¦ Major Bettis and Thomas K. Kase made
closing statements. Boyne grew Indignant
It was his recollection that Boyne. Hart,
Mayer and their followers did not enter
the hall until nearly 9 o'clock. The gpne
ral testified that there were probably
ninety persons present. He thought the
announcement of 246 votes was a bluff.
J,ater in the evening Mr. Curry denied
that he made such announcement. An
other member of the regular club con
fessed that he was the author of the an
nouncement.
G?neral "Warfield was the chief witness
for the regulars. He testified that County
Committeeman Curry called the meeting
to order at 8:04 by General Backus' watch';
that a long speech nominating Major Bet
tis for president was made; that other
officers were put in nomination; trat tel
lers were appointed to receive the ballots;
th.it the roil was called . and every en
rolled member present had the opportun.ty
to votf:.
Several witn-?s?es testified that tho roll
was not failed, and that the result of the
election, was declared wit'.iin fifteen mlii
utes after Â«he time the meeting was callea
to order.
At the outset each side was permitted
to read an opening statement. After in;
reading witnesses were called. On motion
of Augustus Tilden the investigation was
limited and confined to the validity of the
election In *he Forty-third District Club.
The protesting party's witnesses were
first called. Dawson Mayer, I. Linder
man, George J. Boyne, J. D. Hart and
John Scott testified that less than (eighty
men were at the hall when the official
club was organized and yet Curry dt-'
clared that 246 ballots had been cast. All
these witnesses testified that 120 or more
enrolled Republicans were deprived of the
privilege of voting. â¢ â¢
They also testified that Major Bettis de
clared a motion to adjourn carried when
there was an overwhelming vote against
adjournment.
J. H. Harding, who is a hotel-keeper at
SS'J Pine street, testified that his signature
to the protest was forged.
General II. II. Warneld and Thomas K.
Kaee exchanged remarks with some as
perity. The general did not fancy tho
loud tone of the Kase voice. Kase was
not slow In reminding the general that
the voice was addressed to the commiUae
and not to the witness.
While the committee was In session
high words passed bt-tween Aurelius k*.
Bucklngnam and Thomas J-C. Kase. *Â»Jn
this dispute Mr. Boyne participated. I. J.
Truman Jr., chairman of the executive
committee, used his influence to subdue
the wrath of the disputants. Several
members advised Major Bettis to becalm
and not use the term "forgery" with so
much emphasis.
There, vvas u great deal of testimony
submitted on each side.' Major Bettis and
County Committeenian Curry conducted
the case for the olticial or regular club.
Thomas K. Kase and County Committee
man Hoynt managed affairs for the con
testants. The fact was disclosed that
four of the thirty-one signatures attach
ed to the protest were ,not srenulne. One
clear caso of forgery war. developed.
The session' of the committee to which
the disputo was referred began shortly
after 8 o'clock last evening and did not
terminate until midnight. Several exclt
ins Incidents occurred and fistic' en
counters seemed Imminent. , George J.
Boyne and Dawson Mayer were on the
war path af tor the meeting adjourned and
threatened to - exterminate several
partisans of J. J. Curry.
Last evening the executive committee
and' advisory board of j the Republican
County Committee disposed of the pro
test In the Forty-third Assembly district.
A motion that the protest be not sustained
was carried almost unanimously. The re
sult of the action Is the endorsement of
the club of which Major F.*A. Bettls la
president and General R. H. Warfield vice
president. This club was organized ' at
California Hall on the evening of July 9.
Just before the vote on the election of of^
fleers was proclaimed on that evening,
the followers of George J.' Boyne/ Daw
son Mayer and others entered "-the hall,
organized a meeting of their own, and
elected J. D. Hart president..

Practice sometimes makes a perfect
nuisance. .The flrst mill, that of Willie Cole and
Tommy Cox was the best preliminary
seen in this city for many years. Cole had
a number of friends before the fight and
to-day his tacking Is by no means re
duced. His plucky battle won him a host
of admirers. The mutuels paid well on
Cox, J14 being obtained on the last line.
In the Neill-Moffatt fight the biggest
money was placed on Nelll to win from
the seventeenth to the twentieth round.
The mutuels paid $8 on the last line. (Jor
bett handled about ?20,C00 on the two
fights.
The fight promoters are out looking for
a man to match with Moffatt. Fighting
will soon be something: that has been In
Nerv York, and then the stream of pugi
lists will move westward. Tommy Ryan
and Jack Root are among those men
tioned. MofTatfs great Improvement since
his first fight with Neill has raised him
In the estimation of rinpr-poink people and
It is generally thought that he will make
rapid strides toward the top.
In tbe fifth round Moffatt landed heav
ily on NeiU's head, hurting his wrist. He
claims that this is the reason he did not
use his left with more telling effect. While
fighting in New York last year Moffatt
broke a bone In his wrist, and though en
tirely mended -it needs the best of care.
Surprise \ras expressed yesterday by
many that Xoill could recover sufficient
strength to make a whirlwind finish. He
showed that he was In good training and
he fought with eamenesa.
The receipts of the prize-fight were
$5000. Moffatt's share amounts to M7Q0.
Nelll receiving J300. Moffatt was on the
street yesterday, and with the exception
of a badly puffed wrist appeared none
the worse for hia mill. Neill was sick
Friday night after the fight and was very
sore yesterday on account or the heavy
body beating he received.

Mrs. Alice M- M. Fuller, well known
among local pianists, who resides at 2387
Post street, has come Into court with thÂ«
demand that a decree of divorce granted
her from her husband. W. W. Fuller, be
set aside on the ground that collusion ex
isted between them and that hence aha

Mrs. Fuller's assertions, and Fuller, who
is married again, says his wife has filed,
the present suit for the sole purpose of
harassing him. .udge Murasky will
hear the case this week.
MICHAEL BEATS McFABLAND.
"Welsh Rarebit" Has the Better
Luck in the Twenty Mile Kace.
NEW YORK. July 14.â In the presence
of 70W spectators, with scarcely a breeze
to interfere with the riders, Jimmy
Michael defeated Floyd McFarland of San
Jose, California, in a twenty-mile motor
paced race at the Manhattan Beach track
this afternoon. Ho also clipped 21 2-5 sec
onds off the track record for tho distance
The conditions of the race were that if
an accident occurred to either rider or his
pacemakers during the first mile, the men
were to be recalled and the race started
anew. This saved Michael from defeat
by a narrow margin. Michael maintained
his lead for one lap on the first attempt,
but was then passed by McFarland, who
led bv about live yeards corning down the
stretch for the finish of the first mile, lie
fore the latter had reached the tape, how
ever, Michael signaled to the judges that
his motor had broken a chain and he was
just In time to save himself from, haying
to continue the race as best he could.
A new machine was brought out and
Michael, who had won the pole position,
was the tirst to be picked up. He got In
behind his pace witnln the first hundred
yards, with McKarlund right behtnd him.
The Californian caught up on the back
stretch and led by about ten yards dur
ing the first mile, lie increased this to
twenty-live yards on the second milts.
Michael's pacers worked like beavers and
got abreast of the leader twice during the
third mile, but could not pass him.
McFarland. during the sixth mile, was
nearly seventy yards to tho good. Just
then Michaels new machine was seen
coming oh the track again and in a couple
laps more Michael was in behind and at
the beginning of the eighth mile he was
on even terms with the leader. Mile after
mile was traversed with lightning speed.
At no time during the next six miles did
Michael allow the front wheel of his pac
ing machine to be more thun a few yards
behind the rear wheel of McFarland.
At the end of the twelfth mile, the
track record was lowered by 1 3-5 seconds,
but at the end of the thirteenth they were
3-."> second behind the record. In the
fourteenth mile Michael gradually drew
up to McFarland. and on the back
stretch in the second lap of the fourteenth
mile he passed the Californian. while the
spectators on the stands and In the In
tield were frantic with delight. Michael
soon gained about thirty yards on his op
ponent, who was still going very evenly.
Once more the "express" got out of
order when Michael was in the lead by
about forty yards. This was in the fif
teenth mile. Fortunately, his second
machine was near at hiind. In making
tho change he lost scarcely a dozen yards.
Two laps later McFarland had a streak
of bad luck. His motor, which had been
going continuously from tha startoff, was
rendered, useless by the snapping of a
chain and the bursting of a rear tire.
The western cyclist never stopped, but
Michael gained a lap and a quarter on
his rival and from that point the race was
Michael's. All interest in the race was
now at an end. as It was seen that Mc-
Farland could not win. and Michael lin
lshed the twentieth mile In 34:36 3-5, lead
ing McFarland by about 750 yards*

HARDY BEATEN
BY COLLINS IN
TENNIS FINAL
Brilliant Contest Lost to the
Californian by Close
Score.
By S/\/V\ F\ H/\RDY.
CHICAGO, July It.â The finals In singles
in the Western lawn tennis championship
were played to-day before a large audi
ence. Krelgh Collins, who has twice held
the title, succeeded in gaining it again to
day, but only after as long and as brilliant
a match as ever was Fecn on the Kenwood
courts. Sumner Hardy of California, who
received the second prize in the tourna-'
ment, crowded Collins to his limit physi
cally, and the match belonged to either
player to the very last point of the fifth
set. Â¦ â-
Hardy won the toss and took the Bide
favored by the wind. Both men started a
rushing game, following their services to
the net. Hardy passed Collins ' rather
freely, and he soon came in only on his
first service. Hardy ran the set to 5â2
quickly, almost before the sympathizers
of the local man realized the match had
begun. Collins then took, two more games,
but the first 3ct went to Hardy, 6â4.
The next set showed much the same
style of play, both men trying for clean
passes on the return of service, so that
there were few long rallies. This set went
to Collins by the same score with which
Hardy took the flrst.
The third set v/as the decisive one of the
match. Hardv ran the score to 5 â 2 and
40â15, but Collins by steady play pulled
up until he alÂ«o had the set within a point
at 0-5 and 40 â 15. Hardy kept his nerve
and won the set. &â 7.
Both men bogan to show signs of ex
haustion, but took their seven minutes*
rest and a rubdown and went at it again.
This time the set went to Collins by a
score of 6â3. This made the match two
sets all, and the crowd was wildly enthu
siastic.
The men had another seven-minute rest
and they started in on the deciding set.
The sun and hÂ»Â»at seemed to tell on Hardy
more than on the local man. and there is
every reason to bolieve that had Hardy
been acclimated his game would have been
stronger toward the end of the match,
but what he lacked In strength he made
up in nerve, and thp games ran evenly
until four-all was reached, each man win
ning his service. Here Hardy lost his ser
vice on the ninth game, and Collins won
the next and the set. 6 â 4.
Score of the match: 4â C, C â 4, 7â 9, 6â3,
6-4.
Both men drove throughout the match,
taking chances on difficult shots rather
than ivnit for sn opportunity after a long
rally. Collins' ground strokes were very
clever, but as far as clean passes went
the men were about even. As Carr Neel.
' the present Western champion. Is not here
to defend his title, it iroes to Collins by de
fault. .
The semi-final doubles, between the
Hardy brothers and Paret and Collins,
were started alter the single match, but
only one set could bo played, as it grew
dark. The set went to Paret and Collins,

PARIS, July 14.â The American ath
letes, fresh from their victories in
London, won the only two events
decided to-day and secured the
leading places in all the trials
which took place on the opening day of
the world's amateur championships, held
under the auspices of the Exposition.
The contests were inaugurated with mag
nificent weather at the Paris Racing Club
in Pre Catalan, a charmingly situated
glade in the Bois de Bologne. Its pretty
surroundings, however, were hardly ade
quate compensation for the poor accom
modations provided for the visitors, which
will be seriously felt on the days of the
big crowds. But no inconvenience was
experienced to-day, the meager attend
ance being perfectly astounding to the
Americans and English, accustomed to
see tens of thousands at athletic contests
of such international importance as those
of to-day. Not more than a thousand
spectators were present, and the majority
of these came from America. In fact, the
meeting resembled more American college
sports than an international champion
ship held abroad. Only two- small stands
were provided for tbe spectators and
onlv one of these was fairly filled, chiefiy
with bright young American girls, who
wore the colors of the various American
colleges competing and gave unstinted ap
plause as their countrymen secured vic
tories. A portion of the leading stand
was reserved for Americans and it was
Bayly bedecked with the stars and
stripes.
An Auspicious Beginning.
The Americans started by winning the
first heat In the 110 meters hurdles and
places In the other two heats, which they
converted Into a complete victory in the
final heat, winning first, second and third
places.
This they followed up by winning flcst
and second places in the 100 meters fiM
race, and they would have been first,
second and third but for the accident to
Duffy, who won his heat quite handily,
as well as the Hemi-linal, only to have
a tendon of his left leg give way while
leading in the final heat when half of the
distance from the tapes.
The Americans then won two heats out
of three in the S00 meters flat race, all
three heats in the 400 meters flat race, and
both heats in the 400 meters hurdle race.
They also have three out of the fivo
men who have qualified for the final in
the broad jump and three in leading
places out of the five qualifying for the
final in the shot-putting contest, while
Sheldon will represent the United States
in the remaining event; the discus throw
ing, which, judging from to-day's per
formances, is likely to be the only event
which the Americans will fall to carry off
out of the eight events In which they
started.
The feature of to-day's meeting was not
only thÂ»> number of events the Americans
won. but the perfect ease with which they
outstripped tneir competitors, often fin
ishing first and second in the trial heats,
laughing, side by side, and in a canter.
College Yells Cause Wonder.
The introduction of American college
cheers into to-day's proceedings was a
complete revelation, to the Frenchmen
and other foreigners. At the first yell
they apparently imagined some Invasion
of wild Indians had occurred, but. after
hearing the various cries about a hundred
times during the day. they appreciated
the fact that it was simply an outburst or
American enthusiasm or encouragement
of the college men, a great number of
whom were present. The Frenchmen,
however, could not become reconciled to
this form of cheering, and they were
heard to frequently exclaim: \\ hat a
band of savages."
The American methods of starting,
jumping and shot putting were also mat
ters of great interest to the European",
who watched curiously the crouching
posture of the sprinters as they waited
for the tiring of the pistol and the elab
orate preparations of each American ath
lete in finding the length to run for a
jump, and, to them, the peculiar form of
shot putting.
The physiques of the Americans com
pared extremely favorably with that of
the Europeans, and Sheldon's figure at
tracted such attention that he was amus
ingly christened by the Frenchmen "The
little baby."
The natty college costumes of the Amer
icans were a decided contrast to the
home-made attire of some of the bÂ«Â«st
European athletes, who, instead of don
ning a sweater or bath robe after the
trials, walked about in straw hats and
light overcoats.
The 110 meters hurdle race was divided
into three preliminary heats. Kraenzlein,
University of Pennsylvania; Moloney,
University of Chicago; McClaln. Univers
ity of Michigan, and Cholsel, a Fiench
man, ran the first heat and finished in
the order named. Choisel was outclassed
and left the track without clearing tne
last jump.
Pritchard, an Englishman; Remington,
University of Pennsylvania, and Levis of
Syracuse competed and finished as named
in the second heat.
Le Cuyer, a Frenchman, had a walk
over in the third heat.
The seconds and thirds of these heats
contested for entry In the final, which
was secured by Moloney and McClaln.
In the final Kraenzleln won without be
ing hard pushed In 15 2-5 seconds, which
equals the French record on the turf. Mc-
Claln was second and Moloney third.
Innovation for Americans.
The Americans then contested In an
event not usually on sporting programmes
in the United Statesâ that of the discus
throwing. Twenty men competed, chiefly
Hungarians. Swedes and Greeks. The
Americans furnished a contingent of five â
McCracken, Hare, Garrett, Flannagan
and Sheldon. The last named alone se
cured a place among the five who will
dispute the final. Sheldon made long puts,
but they were badly directed, striking a
tree or the fence. He gained third place
with 3* meters 10 centimeters. A Hunga
rian, Bauer, was first with 36 meters 4
centimeters. Janda, a Bohemian, was
second with 35 meters 4 centimeters.
The preliminary of the 800 meters fiat
race brought eight Americans on the
track out of thirteen runners. The closest
of the three heats was the first, in v/hlch
Tysoe, an Englishman; Grant and Drum
heller, both of Pennsylvania: a Dane
named Christiansen. Hall of Brown Uni
versity, a Frenchman named Salomez and
Hayes of Michigan University competed.
Hayes made the running until turning In
to the stretch, when Hall and Tysoe work
ed to the front and Tysoe won by a half
yprd iu the excellent time of 1:59.
The second heat was won by a French
man. Belogp. A Hungarian. Spelde. was
epeond and Scrofford of Syracuse Univer
sity was third. The last named headod
the contestants for three-quarters of the
d{fnance nnd looked like a winner until
Beloge and Speide passed him. the former
winning easily in 2:00 3-5. His victory was
hailed with great enthusiasm by the
French spectators, who otherwise were
rarely demonstrative. His time was slow
er than Hall's, but he took matters leis
urely, and the peneral opinion is that he
Â¦will have to be seriously reckoned with in
the final.
The third heat was contested among the
Americans, Cregan of Princeton, Bray ol
Williams and Lord of Chicago University,
finishing In this order. The firsts and sec
onds In these heats will compete in the
finals.
Jarvis Outruns Tewksbury.
Twenty athletes stripped for the six
trial heats of the 100 meters flat race, ten
being Americans. Austria, Italy. Ger
many, Australia, Denmark and British In
dia were represented by their cracks in
this sprint. For the final Duffy was se
lected by practically everybody as a cer
tain winner. His splendid performances
in the preliminary and semi-final, win
ning as he did apparently without effort,
strengthened this opinion. When tbe pis
tol was fired for the final he left tne
mark like a shot, and had already as
sumed what appeared to be a decisive lead
when he was seen to wobble, and a mo
ment later he fell heavily to the ground.
A groan of disappointment and sympathy
arose from the crowd of Americans, which
changed almost immediately to a shout ot
victory as Jarvis breasted the winning
tape two feet ahead of Tewksbury, with
Rowley, the Australian, a close tnira,
thus securing the trophy for America In
spite of Duffy's misfortune.
Then came the shot-putting, in
the foreign contingent had no show, ine
contest assumed the character or rrienuij
rivalry among the Americans, whose final
victory was an absolute certainty. Shel
don of the New York Athletic Club up
held his reputation and dropped the shot
far ahead of his competitors. McCracken
of the University of Pennsylvan a was
nearest to him, with Garrett of Princeton
third. Sheldon's best put was 13 meters
SO centimeters; McCracken's was 12 meters
85 centimeters, and Garrett's 12 meters 45
centimeters. Sheldon thus did not do so
well as he did in London last Saturday.
Yankees Take Each Heat-
Two More Victories.
The 400-meter flat race brought out fif
teen starters, including seven Americans.
The best time in the* three preliminary
heats which were run to-day was made
by M. W. Long of the New \ork Athletic
Club, who won the first heat in oO 2-5 sec
onds. lA>e of Syracuse was second, yora
of Chicago University, Drumheller of the
University of Pennsylvania and Clement,
a Frenchman, also ran.
The second heat brought out the Gaelic
champion. Faidlde. who holds the French
record for this distance, ol seconds. He
finished third, behind Moloney of Chicago
University, who came in first, ana
Schultx. a Dane, who was second.
iThe third heat proved an- easy victory
for Boardman of the New York Athletic
Club, who, with Holland of Georgetown
Universitv, cantered in, neither caring 1
about first place, being sure of running in
the tinal. . ,
The spectators gathered around the cen
ter of the grounds, where a fenced-in
space was reserved for the broad Jump.
The Americans here had another inning,
obtaining with five entries three places
among the leading five who qualified for
the finals. The Americans topped the list
with Prinstein of Syracuse University,
who cleared 7 meters 17Vi centimeters.
Kraenzleln of the University of Pennsyl
vania was next, with 6 meters 93 centime
ters. Then followed the French champion,
Delannoy, with G meters 7oVz centimeters:
Remington of the University of Pennsyl
vania, with fi meters 72H centimeters, and
Leahy, the English and Irish champion,
who "was fifth, with 6 meters 71 centi
meters.
Tho concluding event of the day, the
400 meters hurdle race, brought only four
men to the tape, although there were ten
Entries. Both heats were won by Amer
icans. Tewksbury of University of Penn
sylvania taking the first and. Levls of
Syracuse second. Xedvod, an Austrian,
was unplaced.
Orton of University of Pennsylvania
secured Uie second heat from Tauzin, a
Frenchman, his only competitor. Levls.
Tewksbury, Orton and Tauzin will con
test in the final. The time of neither
heat was worth mentioning, as none of
the Americans srave themselves any un
necessary exertion.
Arthur F. Duffy. Georgetown Univer
sity, who fell in the 100 meters race,
strained a tendon of his Ipk and was un
able to compete further. Duffy said after
the accident:
"I do not know why my leg gave away.
I felt a peculiar twitching after goin<?
twenty yards. I then seemed to lose
control of it and suddenly it pave out,
throwing me on my face. But that is one
of the fortunes of sport, and I cannot
complain. I am ulan the event went to
an American. I do not think I can com
pete again here.

Until the Very Last
Inning. â¢
Snappy Baseball at Recreation Park
Results in a Defeat to the
Dudes, Who Go Back
a Peg.
Â«.
San Francisco 4, Oakland 2.
"Ham" Iburg was in grreat form yester
day, so much so that the Dudes were be
wildered out of their mental casings.
They could do nothing with his corkscrew
curves until the ninth and that Is why
Hank has addwd another victory to his
late nappy succession. Borchers was not
as strong, the hits of the local team be
ing: bunched In lucky innings.
The Dudes showed a new face in the
ranks of diamond swelldom, a Mr. Held,
whose performance in right field was of
thÂ»Â» be.<l, thoujjh with the stick he did
nothing pyrotechnic. "Josh" ReilJy was
in trim and played a star intield game
but for a single exception. In fact all of
Hack's men were In the game. At last
the local team seems to have shed its
wrapping of sweet plumber.
I'ntil Fri/co came to the bat in the
fourth the game was of the one, two,
three order, but one player reaching first
baae. Then Hank's crew pulled them
selves together and sent two men over
the rubber. Schwartz beat the ball out
on a clevt-r bunt and was forced to sec
ond when Pabst got four bad ones. A
parsed ball advanced both runners a base
and then Sullivan with a clean hit to left
scored Schwartz and Pabst. A sacrilice
bv Levy and the succeeding deaths of
tfnig and Rellly sent the local team to
the benches.
In the rifth Oakland started well but
finished poorly. On an error by Krug and
another by the umpire which was also
charged to Krug, Francks and Moski
man took to the bags. Arrellanes fol
lowed with a hit to right but Francks
dit-d at the plate on account of Hilde
brand's great throw in. Two more dead
ones and the Inning was over.
In the fifth Pabst running for Iburg and
Hildebrand who also made first bag on
a hit, were enabled to score by assisting
swats and Oakland error*.
It look the ninth to .send a Dude over
the rubber. With two men gone Moskt
man rolled out a double, scoring on Arrel
lanes' single to left. Held followed with
a double, but he triad to take three bases
and died at that bag. Arrellanes scored.
The score:

MANGLED IN A SAWMILL.
Tliirteen-Year-Old Boy Meets a Ter-
rible Death in Oregon.
Special Dliratch to The Call.
BAKER CITT. Or.. July 14.â Word was
brought to this city this week of the hor
rible accident which befell Arnold Eccles,
aged about 13 years, and formerly a resi
dent of this city. The unfortunate boy in
some manner got caught in the machinery
of the sawmill in which he was working
at Vrento and was terribly mangled. Ono
leg was torn from his body, and he was
otherwise mutilated, causing a speedy
death.
The boy was a nephew of David Ecclea.
president of the Oregon Lumber Company,
operating in Utah and Oregon. The re
mains were shipped to Ogden for burial.
Kaymond s place is in Sonora and is
known as the "Angels" Lodging House,
and it was there -McClure took up his
abode during his stay In the town. Mc-
Clure is not quite certain now how mat
ters came to the pass they finally did, but
ha doos recall that from the beginning
Mollie was exceedingly attentive to him.
The very first day of his stay there Mc-
Clure lugged in a wooden box and calling
Mrs. Raymond's and Mollies' attention to
it demanded what they thought of such
an object fcr a pet. The box contained
Â£M00 in gold coin, the proceeds of the sale
of a mine McClure had just negotiated.
After the b<>x incident he says Mollie was
mnre loving than ever and Mrs. Raymond
asked him to call her "mamma."
Il was not long before Mollie announced
her engagement to her ancient admirer
and set the happy dav for the second Sun
day in August.
"Everything was agreeable to me," saM
McClure yesterday when he told his tale
of woe. "Mollie was awfully pretty and
1 wa-Â« stuck on her. 1 got her several
presentsâ a for $45, a chain for $1:1
and two rinps valued at $13 and $7 50 re
spectively. She wanted me to get her
more Jewels, but I told her to wait till
I got to town, for I explained I could get
jewels mure reasonable in San Francisco
than in Sonura."
It was about this time that Mnllie real
ized that the second Sunday in August
was a long way off and asfced MxClure.
"What's tho use In putting this off so
long?" McClure again was willing, but
begged the chambermaid of the Angel's
loÂ«1;?ir>cr house to let him have a week to
get ready in.
"She said all right." said McClure. "I
settled up my buslne??, got my money
together and she decided that we should
come here to get married. A day previous
to our departure Mr?. Raymond came to
me am) said. 'Now, Charlie, you will be
going off on a bridal trip with Mollie and
you might get rcoklpss and spend all your
money, and I would advise you to leave
JVVj with me. and should you" need money
you could telegraph me for It.' "
However, McClure did not see fit to take
advantage of Mr?. Raymond's offer. "I
just let her have Â£50." ho said, "and then
we came away. Oh, there was such a
time when wo left. Mollie and Mrs. Ray
mond shed copious tears and embraced
over and over again."
On the train McClure was introduced to
a man he only knows as "Fred" and
whose recommendation was the fact that
h<Â» was M<>llf.Â»'s friend and tended bar in
Sonora. At OakdaJe on the journey down
a telegram was handed to Mollie and
when she had mastered its contents she
tr.id McClure it was a command from
Mrs. Raymond to return at once to So
nora unless McClure sent her (Mrs. Rav
mond> 150. McClure consulted with Mollie
and "Fred" about this and. acting upon
th'-ir advice, he telegraphed Mrs. Ray
mond the desired amount.
"When we got to town, "explained Mc-
Chire, "Mo'lie refined to go to a hotel
RÂ»id said she wanted to go fo Mrs. Millar
at 127 Hyde street. I agreed and brought
her up there. They had. however, no
room for me and sn I lodged downtown.
All day Thursday Mollie spent in shon-
pine. She purchased extensively, getting
many dresses and any number of silk
waists. She had arranged that on Friday
morning we were to leave for Portland
and from there proceed to Seattle, where
we should be married. On Thursday night
she asked me for 5100, but I refused to
give It to her.
"On Friday moraine." continued Mc-
Clure. "I went to meet her, expecting
I to leave for Portland. I found her in bed
I and Â«hf said she was 111. I suKsested that
a doctor be sent for. but Fred, who was
there, explained to ms that women. were
peculiar and that her illness was prob
ably caused by the fact that I had re
fused her the $100. Acting upon l-'red's
advice I gave Mollie $20. She got better
Immediately, hut it war? long past the
train time Hrd we could not get off. Then
she said. 'What is the use of griing off at
all? Let's pet married here." And so she
arranger! that we would be msirried on
Saturday morning at 10 o'clock."
When Mollie set the wedding day she
decided she must have more linery and
sent McClure out to purchase more silk
waists, a fur cape, a ring and various
other things. On Friday evening Mollie
dismissed McClure early. "I want to get
to rest." slip said, and that was the last
MoClure saw of her.
Yesterday morning, when the aged, ar-
I dent swain called for Mollie to accom
pany him to a minister he found no blush
ins: bride awaiting him. The bird had
flown and the following note was all she
left as balm for bis lacerated heart:
Say Charlie: 5ty Ocd. I just can't marry
you and I am very sorrie to say eo, because
yon have dr-ne po much for me and I am just
crazy, and I've met some friends of mine and
wt- are urolr.jr to Lns Anpele^ in the morning.
I will b* a long: ways off when you get this
ari'i I h"pe you wiU rorgive me for I will never
livo happy with you. MOLLIE.
There was also this letter for Mrs. Mil
ler, the landlady of the Hyde-street lodg
inc-house:
Mr.Â«. Miller: How can you ever forgive me
for golr.ff away and not letting: you know It,
but I can't marry Charlie, ror I do not love
him. I may nÂ»ver ree you again. I am going
to take -the train to-nlsht to Los Anpeles' with
my friends, oh. I am cra;y. I don't know
what to do, so good-by. God blesa you.
MOLLIE.
McClure's suspicions were at first direct
ed toward William Ayton, otherwise the
only original "Bosco," the snake-eater.
Bnsoo. however, had not left town and
declared that all he knew of Mollie Sands
was the fart that she was anxious to
be a "vanishing lady" in his show.
When McClure found Bosco was still In
town he said:
"It dawns upon me now that FYed may
not have been the friend he pretended to
be and I would not he surprised if he
and Mollie had. gone off together.
"I don't want Mollic bark," he said in
conclusion. "When I found she had de
serted me all my love for her turned
to hatred. But I want to get those fine
clothes back from her. I don't want her
to go around all dresje*! up in the clothes
I paid for ar>d having other fellows make
love to her."
Detectives Dillon and McMahon are
searching for Mollie.

Chinese Empire Reform Association
Appeals to Li Hung Chang 1 to
Suppress Boxer Outrages.
The members of the Chinese Empire
Reform Association of this city are very
much perturbed over the serious condi- j
tion of affairs in the Orient and are ex- i
ertinp every possible endeavor to pre- i
vent the persecution of foreigners resid
ing in China. Cablegrams are being
sent daily to the Viceroys of the differ
on t provinces praying them to use all
their influence to prevent further slaugh
ter of innocent persons of other nations
who have not had an opportunity to leave
the country for some p.ace of safety.
They declare in their messages that the
outrages now being perpetrated by the
fanatical boxers and condoned by the
Chinese authorities are in direct violation
of treaty rights, and ask that foreigners
be protected there e\-en as Chinese have
been protected in this country.
The members of the local branch of this
progressive organization seem to repre
sent the better element of the Chinese
merchant class of California, and the
president of the association. In an in
torview last evening, freely expressed his
indignation regarding the laxity of the
Chinese officials. He insists that the Box
ers might easily have been suppressed
Ions- apo were it not for the fact that
Prince Tuan and the Empress Dowager
have tacitly consented to the destruction
of foreigners, believing in their ignorance
that all complications may be settled in
this crude manner.
In the very midst of all their humane
attempts to save foreigners in China the
reformers were made to feel the wrath
of the imperial Government when they
read the telegTaphlc report in yesterday
morning's Call recounting the attempted
assassination of Kang Yu-Wel, their
chief, at Singapore.
Following are some of the messages
sent to China by the association: /
SAN FRANCISCO, July 13, 1D01
To 14 Hung Chans. Canton: Reports received
here that Boxers are mass<acreinfr forclsners.
This is in violation of treaty rights. We pray
your Excellency to instruct all Viceroys to pro
tect all foreigners even as we are protected
hv them here. We be? of you to suppress these
barbarous outrasres that peace and resumption
of commerce may follow. CHINESE EMPIRE

A message to Singapore q*kinÂ£ for in
formation resardins the reported wouhd
inp of Kang Yu-Wel is quite pathetic in
tone. It reads:

pense in forwarding us all details regarding thÂ«

Sad Result From Closing an
Angels Camp Millinery
Store.
HOW that the Investigation
of probate matters Is occu
pying the attention of the
Grand Jury and the public,
O. J. Bamberger and his client.
August C. HInz, are convinced
that all is not well with the civil
departments of the local court.
They have reached this conclusion
after receipting for $2 as compen
sation in full for a judgment of
JS42 13 recently recovered against
P. Muller, a milliner of Angels
Camp, Calaveras County.
Some time ago Hinz, at the re
quest of Muller, forwarded a bill
of goods to .the latter's establish
ment at Angels Camp with an ac
companying bill for $S42 IS. Muller
was given time in which to meet
the bill, but finally, when payment
was not forthcoming, Hinz as
signed his demand to O. J. Bam
berger, who commenced attach
ment proceedings for the recovery
of the amount named. A copy of
the attachment was placed in the
hands of Ben K. Thorn, Sheriff of
Calaveras County, and he proceed
ed to collect on the judgment.
Yesterday his return of sale was
filed in the office of County Clerk
Deane and it tells a story. Thorn
sets forth that he obeyed the or
der of court and sold the property
at auction. The sum of $73 was of
fered and accepted for the JS-12 IS
stock of goods, and then Thorn
began to figure up his expenses.
Copies of the notice of sale, -print
ers' proofs, mileage, commissions
and keepers' fe.es figured up 573,
and $2 remained for Bamberger
and client. County Clerk Deane
received a postoffice order for this
amount yesterday, ' which Chief
Deputy Joseph Goddard now holds
subject to the call of the rightful
owners, who may have the same
on presentation of proofs.
ASKS PROTECTION FOR
FOREIGNERS IN CHINA
Three events indicate the increasing
importance attached to the study of met-
allurgy and mining by the intelligent
men. The meeting of the American Asso
ciation fcrr the Advancement of Science
was held last month at Columbia Univer
sity and was well attended. The summer
meetings of the American Institute of
Mining Engineers will be held at Sydney,
Capo Breton and Halifax; Nova Seotht,
.next month under t lie- auspices of the
Canadian Mining Institute; The interna
tional Congress of Mining and Metallurgy
was held last month. The opening meet
ing- of the last mentioned assemblage was
hold in the Grand Hall of the Calais des
Congres at the exposition. After the
opening- address the congress divided into
two sections. A subject of considerable
Interest was treated of June 19 in the min
ing section, it being "Ventilation and the
Use of Explosives in Coal Mines."
M. Delafond reported that safety ex
plosives had occupied the attention of the
French Government since 1900* A com
missioner was appointed. Subsequently
the Government issued regulations de
claring obligatory the use of explosiVea
that had been recommended by the com
mission in mines in which fire damp or
inflammable dust was prevalent. The
chief safety explosives in use in France
an? Rrisontine and srisonite, both names
being derived from Vgrison," which means
tire damp. Down to the end of lust year,
as estimated, 16.000.OX) shots had been fired
with the new explosive. Only one case of
explosion of Ore damp was due to the new
blasting ajjent. Victor Watteyne and Lu
clen Densel described explosives used in
the coal mines of Belgium. The Belgian
Government also prescribes the explosives
that may be employed in coal mines. The
result of such control has been very sat
isfactory in lessening the number of coal
mining accidents.
The Geological Society of America met
in New York June 20 and was presided
over by Dr. G. M. Dawson. director of the
Geological Survey of Canada.
H. W. Turner read a paper upon "The
Geology of the Silver Peak Mining Dis
trict." This district is in Nevada, in Ks
meralda County, on the western edge of
the Great Basin. A part' of Mr. Turner's
paper is as follows:
The rPS'<Tn is chararterlzftl by isolated ridges
and wi.le valleys, the lowest portions of which
are playas or dry lake beds. These piayas are
often covered with incrustations of salt. Thus,
the Clayton Valley playa. Just east of Silver
5'eak village, is coated with a dazzling white
sodium chloride of sufficient purity to be used
ss it is for domestic purges, while the Co
lumbus playa and cne In Fish Lake Valley
are rich in borax and related salts. The old
est rocks, except some gneisses of doubtful
a?e, are Lower Cambrian, the Middle Cam
brian and Silurian being also represented.
Volcanic activity began in paleaTjnlc times and,
tiary. when a lake covered a large part of the
diytrlet and deposited several thousand feet of
sediments. The Eilver Peak range was ele
vated after the lake period, as is evidenced by
the lake detx>sits arching: up over the rancÂ°.
The ci;iof economic interest of the region lies
in the e n 'ti and silver veins In Mineral Rldsc
one of the eastern spurs of the Silver Peak
ranee. Thf^e veins usually occur at the con
tact between the granites and gneisses and
the overlying Cambrian rocks. They are of
two kinds, quartz veins containing pyrite and
free gold with a little silver, and quartz veins
containing lead sulphides and silver with a
comparatively small amount of jjo'.d. Along
tli* latter veins, ao fur as observation poos,
there are basic dioritic dikes, which do not
usually. If at all, occur along the veins con
taining chiefly erold. When the investigations
have been completed it may be possible to show
therefore that these dikes have exerted a defi
nite influence on the kind of ore deposited. It
may be possible that the dlorite magma is
the source of the lead and silver. The aban
doned Vanderbllt mines and the Homestake
are examples of th 1 ? lead-silver veins, and the
Siher Peak mine of the free mllllnfr gold veins.
The American Institute of Mining
Engineers will visit in Canada the steel
works now in construction at Sydney and
the coal handling plant at the internation
al and other piers of the Dominion Coal
Company, the collieries and steel works
at New Glasgow, Stellarton, Westvllle
and other important districts; the gold
mines of Nova Scotia; the Wabana Iron
mines of the Dominion Iron Company; al
so various other points for sight seeing
and pleasure. Theodore Dwight. who con
ducted the excursion of the institute
members to California, will be in charge
of the Canadian excursion.
The first annual meeting of the South
west Miners' Association was held a few
davs ago in the permanent headquarters
of thn" association' at First and Main
streets. Los Angeles. The report of G..N.
Nolan, the secretary, indicated that the
organization was doing well. It has 300
members. Secretary Nolan said that
measures have .been taken to organize
auxiliary societies in sixty-four mining
ramps in California. Nevada, Arizona,
New Mexico, Sonora and Lower Califor

The Gold Run Gravel Company and the
Inskip Company, in Placer County, have

The Bridgeport Chronicle-Union says
that at noon on Monday last the cyanide
plant at the Castle Peak mine, near
Bridgeport, was discovered to be on fire,
hut it was Foon extinguished with little
damage. And again at about 1:30 o'clock
yesterday morning an alarm was given
that the mill was on fire. It was found
that the ore bin of the mill was on fire,
the same having been found to be sat
urated with conl oil. After two hours of
hard work on the part of the miners and
all connected v.ith the mine and mill thÂ»
nre was extinguished, with but little if
any Injury to the mill, but the bin was
destroyed. It was very evident that it was
the work of an incendiary, and the owner.
Arthur D. .Cullum. who is now at the
mine, offers a reward of $2T>0 for the arrest
and conviction of the person or persons
who set fire to the mill.

Mollie Lands Comes to Town to Marry Upholsterer Mc-
Clure, Takes His Money, Changes Her Mind and
Does the Vanishing Lady Act.
17 N an Interview yesterday with Attor
ney E. S. Pillsbury on the subject of
jj the methods of Assessor Dodge this
: year in taxing franchises and the
j great increase on that account in the
j assessments of several corporations
in which he is interested, and the
action of the Beard of Equalization
! in refusing to lower the valuation of the
j corporate franchise of the California Pow
der Works and other like concerns, he
said: "I do not wish to make any rash
criticism upon the action of Assessor
Dodge. I think he is a man of high per
sonal character and ambitious to make a
good record as a public officer, but he is
pushing this franchise business too far.
Xo doubt some corporations have shirked
their taxes in the past, and that is one
of the causes for this raid, but the thing
is now going just as badly the other way.
Take the California Powder Works, for
example. It is one of the oldest corpora
tions in the State. It has had its office
and paid taxes In this city for over forty
years. It has built up extensive works
in Santa Cruz and Contra Costa counties
It Is one of the commercial institutions
of this coast which has held its trade
against Eastern competition. While near
ly all our merchants have been driven
| back, more or less, out of their original
i territory, some of them almost to the
gates of San Francisco, this company has
| held Its own and is to-day selling its
products eastward through Arizona. Colo
rado, Idaho and Montana. For years it
could pay no dividends on account of this
fight tor its trade.
"It expended over $100,000 in experiment-
Ing upon the manufacture of explosives
adapted to modern warfare, a bad invest
ment but for the Spanish war, and Its
powder was used by the fleet of Dewey at
Manila. It now claims the credit of mak
ing the best smokeless powder In use any
where. It resumed dividends about two
years ago, the stockholders having re
ceived nothing on their capital for over
five years previous. Its ability to renew
its dividends was due to its able manage
{ ment. It paid the same dividends last
year as this and had substantially the

I was assessed at Il'J.OOO; this year it wa*
' first put at $750,000 and afterward a man
! from the Assessor's ofnee came around
and said that it would be reduced to Â£50,
000, but he supposed the company woula
i pay promptly on this last amount. The
company did not pay, but asked for a re
duction to the value of the franchise,
which was nothing, and this request was
refused. The company, in self-protection,
will now move its legal place of business
out of San Francisco.
"This year the company gave In to the
Assessor over $300.Â»XÂ») for money and sol
vent credits on which taxes will be paid.
Next year this city will get none of that
class of property, but the county to which
it moves will have the benefit of it. The
company has always paid and is willing
to pay taxes on every dollar of its tangi
ble property. The right to be a manufac
turing or trading corporation is of no
more intrinsic value than the right to be
a partnership. Under the statutes of this
State a corporation may be formed for
the transaction of any such lawful busi
ness. It is merely the privilege to exist
in that manner. The law also provides
that a partnership may be created foÂ»
like purposes; it is only another form or
existence for conducting business. Taka
the house of Holbrook. Merrill & Stet
son, for instance; the members of it had j
their election under the law whether to
be a firm or a corporation. A lawyer or
a doctor must have a license, as providea
by law. before practicing his profession.
It mteht as well be said he should be as*
sessed for that right. The earnings of a
corporation depend upon the skill and
abllitv of its management, and not the
franchise
"The vice of this sort of taxation Is that
it Is governed by no rules in fixing values.
Another corporation with which I am con
nected was assessed $2500 last year on
its franchise; this year the Assessor has
attempted to raise its franchise to Jl.OoO,
000 The capital stock and dividends have
continued exactly the same. All its tan
gible property liable to. taxation has been
assessed separately. This shows an elas
ticity which is surprising and dangerous.
You cannot expect men to invest capital
on such contingencies. It seems that It
was necessary to increase the assessment
roll by $20,000,000 in order to get the neces
sary revenues for the current year under
our new form of city government and the
Assessor has reached out for these cor
porationato supply this extra amount.
Next year It may be found necessary to
add $20,000,000 more in the same way. It
appears that Assessor Dodffe does not
really claim that these franchises are tan
gible, taxable property, but that this
method of assessing 13 an indirect way for
gathering an Income tax for which there
is no express law. Â»He professes to only
assess the franchises of corporations
which are making money. He goes In par
ticularly for those which are listed on
the stock board. The result Is that no
new companies are being listed and the
old ones are getting oft. so it must only
be a question of time when the board it
self must become extinct unless there is
a change in the situation. It is interesting
to note by comparison that the Emporium
is assessed $150 this year on Its corporate
franchise, the Pacific Coast Steamship

"The Cambric Mask." by Robert Cham-
bers. Is a mixture of science, sentiment,
conspiracy and desperate adventure,
which is all too short for the complex in-
terest of its plot. : The fact that the hero
la a quiet man of science and the heroine
the assistant in his laboratory does not
prevent the story from being a succession
of exciting scenes, which reach their cli-
max in a raid of the White Caps, made
still more thrilling since this takes place
near a bay of quicksand ready to engulf
the unwary and to set wrong: things right.

I. I no sooner said the words than
my wife said, 'Papa, I am shot â I'm
dying-.' She stretched out her hands
to me and I caught her hands and
eased her down on the sand. I said,
'Mamma, don't stir; I'll go and get my
rifle.' I then ran to the house, when
this man Ehlers, who lives near, ha
fired at me, the bullet missing me and
catching my boy's dog.
"Gayer he fired two shots from be
low the hill. Then I secreted myself
in the house and would not go out.
Gayer fired several more shots from
below the hill. When it got a little
dark I crept out like a dog and went
to Ocean View."
Such was the declaration of "William
Mitchell at the Coroner's inquest held at
Colma yesterday Into the cause of death
of David and Mrs. Elizabeth Mitchell
which occurred on the evening of July 4.
The aged colored man after stating that
he sent word to the Sheriff, said that he
returned to his home, put pillows under
the heads of his dead, covered them with
a canvas, kissed them "good night," and
wÂ«nt Into his desolate house.
"Who were these men who were stand
ing at the window, and what window?"
inquired District Attorney Bullock, who
conducted the Inquiry.
"Inisand's window," was the reply of
Mitchell; "Mr. Ehlers was one man;
Lemoscher was the otherâ the same- man
that Ehot the boy and the wife. I Bay
the shots that killed my boy and my wife
came from that Imsand window. Gayer
at this time was on the lower side of the
hill to my left."
In reply to the questions of a Juror the
witness said that four shots came out of
the window, one of which hit the dog.
There were two more shots at that time
and a number afterward. Mitchell's tes
timony further showed that his wife stood
In a position to be shot from the window.
The testimony of Mitchell was all there
was of interest brought out during the in
quisition. The three accused men were
THAT night at 6 o'clock I was
sitting: on the steps of my hen
house, on the ranch. My â¢wife was
inside the house at the table. David
vras feeding the pigs and covering
The swillbox for the night. My wife
told me there was a man in my place.
I stepped out a piece and saw this
man Gayer come alongside the hill in
my place and walk up to the line
fence of Crocker's. I called to Dave
'Look at that. What do you call itP'
He said, 4 I don't know.' I said, 'He
has painted himself with dirt and
locks as black as my boys do.' We
then laughed and walked away, at
the same time I keeping my eye on
Gayer. He Â¦walked along the fence
to the lower part of the hill. I then
lost sight of him and went back to
the steps. Then I called to I>ave to
come and take the saw and see if it
would cut; also to get a can of water
Â»or the night. Dave takes the saw, a
Jittle oil brush and the can and starts
cff. I remained on the steps. In about
a minute I heard a report about like
the sound of a good-sized firecracker.
Immediately after I heard the report
of a rifle and my boy hollered 'Oh,'
end I jumped. As I came to the open
ing I saw my boy with his shirt
bosom covered with blood. [Here the
witness was overcome with emotion
and sobbed for some time.] I sung
out, 'ThÂ«y have shot my boy.' I ran
to my boy. My wife was there about
as quick as I was. I grabbed my boy
by the shoulders. My wife, standing
at the boy's feet, said, 'Who shot
himP
â¢* 'Them, two men right there â stand
ing right there at the window,' said
not present; Mrs. Imsand was not in at
tendance, though summoned as a witness,
a fact which caused much comment. It
was predicted several days ago that there
would be a ghooting match when tha
"niggers" came tq Colma. and that it
would be necessary to disarm every one
entering the Jury room, but there were
no signs of trouble. Mitchell was accom
panied by two of his sons and as 'soon as
the inquest was over left the town.
It was intended by Coroner Crowe to
call Frank Wuttrich, the deaf man who
â¢was In the Imsand house at the time of
the shooting, but the Investigations of
Sheriff Mansfield showed that the man
must have been extremely Intoxicated at
that time, and oblivious to all mundane
affairs.
It is evident that Mitchell intends that
in his pursuit of justice he shall lose no
possible point that would lead to the con
viction of the murderers of his people.
He has retained William S. Barnes, ex-
District Attorney of San Francisco, and
H. H. McCloskey to assist District At
torney Bullock of San Mateo County in
the prosecution. Barnes after hearing the
verdicts remarked that the proceedings
were a "farce." There were two verdicts,
the findings ef which were similar. This
is the rather strangely constructed dec
laration of the jury:
We find that the cause of death was shock
and hemorrhage by a gunshot wound in the
hands of some person or persons unknown to
the Jury.
The other witnesses examined were Au
topsy Physician J. L. Ross, Constable D.
T. Neville, who first found the bodies.
Deputy Coroner Clyde Fox and Sheriff
Mansfield. Their testimony was very
brief and covered only the obvious facts
that had come under their observation In
their investigations, all of which have
been fully given in the columns of The
Call. Their evidence, boiled down, tended
to show that the fatal shots came from
the direction of the Imsand house.
The Jury was composed of J. H. Im
walle (foreman). John Rogers. M. Griffin,
A. Morgan!, P. Arminino, Alfonso George,
John Biggio, V. J. Hohman and F. Pierce.
There was an annoying delay of about
three-quarters of an hour in beginning the
inquest, due to the fact that Juryman
TJiggio. who is employed at the Chinese
/^metery, considered his own affairs of
more consequence than those of the pub
lic. He learned to his sorrow a lesson he
will not forget for ninety days at least,
aÂ« Coroner Crowe announced that Mr.
Blgglo would spend the next three
months In jail for his contempt for the
law.

Women of "Woodcraft.
California Circle of the Women of
Woodcraft has been very successful dur
ing the past term, having added to its
membership at every meeting. The meet
ings of the circle are harmonious, so
ciable and pleasant. This in- a measure Is
no doubt the reason for large attendance
at meetings. A few evenings since Mrs.
A. J. Weinert (nee Walsh), who re
cently became the bride of A. J. "\% einert,
the popular banker of Golden Gate Camp
of the Woodmen of the World, was ten
dered a reception by the circle. There were
congratulatory addresses and presentation
by the officers of the circle to Mrs. Wei
nert of a beautiful collection of choice
flowers with the best wishes of all for a
happy married life. The daughter of the
guardian neighbor will, during the ap
proaching term, succeed her mother as
head of the circle and it Is the hope of
the members that she will do much to
advance the interests of the circle and
maintain the pleasant relations that have
existed during her mother's term. TnÂ«re
is a bond of fraternity between this circle
and Tamalpais Camp that has seldom
been equaled in- any other fraternal or
ganization. The two work In harmony and
each does all it can to advance the other.

grand officers, who congratulated the offi
cers of the grove upon the success of the
tlrst outing given by it.
Noble Grand Arch Lange has sent out
Ms first list of official visitations and from
the visits he announces he is evidently
determined to follow closely in the foot
steps of James F. Martlnonl, his prede
cessor, and strive to emulate his very suc

MRS. SOPHA E. KING, Organizer.
work of an organizer on the Pacific Coast.
Her success as a fraternal worker has
been most remarkable. She has worked
in California, Washington and In Oregon,
and that extensively. Wherever she has
been she has organized in these States
and she has the record of never having
failed in the last two named States in or
ganizing a circle of the Women of Wood
craft. She Is possessed of an undaunted
spirit and has undertaken journeys in
wild parts of the country which strong
men would have hesitated to start upon.
At one place in California she made a
misstep while descending from a stage
and sprained one of her ankles. When she
reached the hotel she was informed that
the "town was full of all kinds
of fraternal organizations," and
that to remain there would only
be a waste of time. She made a can
vass of the place, going on crutches, and
before she left she organized a circle with
twenty-three charter members. Her rec
ord in fraternal work is unequaled.
Airs. King has traveled extensively,
having visited many parts of Europe and
Asia. She was one of the first to be iden
tified with the auxiliary to the Woodmen
of the World.. She Is a ready speaker. Is
well ut tn facts and figures In connection
with the order she represents and has a
large amount of knowledge concerning
other orders. At the recent session of the
District Convention In Sacramento she
was elected a delegate to the Grand Cir
cle that is to meet in Salt Lake, where
she will be a candidate from California
for grand honors. Shortly after her recep
tion by the Women of Woodcraft of this
city she sailed on the City of Puebla for
Everett, Wash., to visit relatives there.

NEW TORK. July 14.-The Financier eays:
The intcrestlns feature of the New York Clcar
i Ing-house bank statement for the week ending
j Juiy 14 i^ an Increase of J4.7S1.0OO in cash hold
ing?. Of this gain Jl.3S6.7fO was In the form
of ?peclÂ«\ two large institutions reporting the
, entire addition to the reserve. The statement
! is more nearly in accord with the known opera
! tions of the week than was the previous ex-
I Dibit, and this leads to the assumption that the
' Hems which did not enter Into the statement of
j July 7 tigure In the present one. The items do
I not correspond with the changes nuted. The
ileposits expanded only J1.64O.3CO, almost ex
activ the same amount thai loans declined. The
additions of cash, therefore, do not flKure at all
in the deposit Item, and for this reason the
gain in exÂ«-ess reserve was unusually large, ag
gregating JÂ».47O,9:'d. The surplus now stande at
nearly JlUOwt.000. It is not likely that this
gain will influence the money market locally,
but international conditions are such that a
change In prevailing rates would not be sur
prising. The advance .in sterling on July 13
was so sharp that gold exports were out of the
question, arid with the impending Chinese prob
: lem affecting foreign markets, may produce
j rather unex;ected results.
The banks here are still gaining from the in
terior, although in smaller volume, and gold
reserves from the Klondike and one shipment
Â»rom Australia will serve to increase the local
money cupply soon. The demand for funds Is
not as urgent as waa the case at this season
last year, owing to a more moderate volume of
bu j*in<?89 snd l&sscricd prices, bu t. Gonscrv&tlvc
opinion inclines to the belief that money must
150 higher before the close of the fall season.
The opening cf the Presidential campaign now
nearly at hand will be a factor in this respect
not to be Ignored. The New York banks are
adding gradually to their circulation. One bank
has a total of JC.DC0.000 outstanding, another
J4,6CO.CO and three ethers over Jl.to0.000 each.
The gain since July, 1S9S, has been about J10,
000, ooy.
London Market.
N.EW TORK. July 14.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
Old hands say this was the idlest day they
ever knew on the Exchange here. Some mar
kets did not even open. Paris, Glasgow and
Edinburgh closed. American stocks which were
sold in the first hour by "punters," who were
disappointed in profits on a turn, recovered
later when the selling was over. There was
no changes In money rates. The Bank of
England sold Â£71,000 In French coin and Â£2000
fcr export to Roumanla.

As the season advances the conditions gov

higher prices. The crops up north, while net
failures, are nothing extra, and the south will
need supplies from this quarter. The supply
of sown Hay In California is under the re
quirements, and volunteer, of which there is
a large supply, will not take Its place. Dealers
look for a tirm market from now orr and most
of them expect still higher prices. The feeling
at the moment is very firm.

ICEW TORK, July 14.â The f=c!e Interest at
taching to to-day's market ws? ar. example of
tfullnees. In that reepeet it was a true Index
cf the speculative condition, which Is cne of
entire uncertainty an*! lack of conviction. Even
the professional trader* who have constituted
tttfillttâ the champions cf certain stocks
during the week were not In evijence and
czi'.y PTTjaJl trades between the regular fre- i
<;uet:Tere of the floor were mad* at any time.
Offerirss to kQ made unusually large Inroads |
on prices, twvauFe no one stood ready to buy |
ex.-i any demand to buy caused a rapid advance j
because no one was on hand to sell. Most cT
the board rr.prr.be.rs wprc out of town for a
holiday, confident that nothing that could oc
cur would Induce any sudden activity to de- j
vel^p. Boose desultory eCorts were mait to Â¦
advance Union Pacific by making bids for thÂ« j
next Olvldr-nd on a Fpecified r.urr.bcr of shares |
t Â¦ m. hlpher figure than the prevailing dividend I
rate. But these efforts secured little atten- I
liun. The rr.arket was as a whole lower tha l j
"f.ft r.ipV.t when the back statement appearid. |
There Â»a* Fome little buying then to cover |
ehort*. Sterling Exchange market was noir.- i
lnal as usual on a Saturday, but the j
posted rat<-Â« ft r demand sterling were advanced ;
'fi<i In res; or.se to the rise In London discount*, j
It Is pretty certain t'.ot these developments â¢
forcfhidnw Â«.n advance in the Bank of Eng- I
land rr.lrr.Irr.um rflsrcunt rate and export fcf
gold from New York next Â«wk.
l*r'.c(rÂ» of stork* ate hijrher again th!i> week, I
but the, movemt-r.t was vÂ»-i-y irrÂ«'Ku!ar and the
highett prices wÂ«-re DOC maintained in any !
caee. The movement was practically a da;>:i- ;
catlnn cf that of Ian weÂ«k and gave every
appear* nee of hating been altnort entirely in !
rirofe^slonal âÂ¦ .- Â»nd umicr manipulation. It â¢
la evident i!:at there haa been formed a pri>
fcrloTÂ»al ball itrty. which :Â» clearly more a*- !
grrKSlve and commands greater resources than
any movement that haÂ« been active for some â¢
time paÂ»t.
As the <-r>rr.-carryinr roads are berefited by
the romr-aratlveiy favorable result! of the win-
Icr Wheat crop, the bulls found In that ffroup,
and especially in I'nion X J cciflc. the most ef
fective fie!H for manipulation. Here air! there
in the ppe^laltlps was found a *tof k which "tad
advanced Â« j asi!y and brought out little i-ellfntj. j
Another matter wh'ch Jlsappolnred the ex- j
pectation of the l>car>s \vaÂ« the small efTect j
produced on the money market, by the unex- |
pectedly weak bank rtattfment for the ).t?t '
trerk. It was ttiXtd by som* of the fj-eirn f

ml^ht ehip *ro!d by Â«hia m-e^Ii's etÂ«?aner. tlmr. !
making further inro^dw upon the cash res-rves j
ot the New York banks. But when Fteutner I
day arrived the expected FhlpirentB were not â¢
asnoun'-ed. ov.-lng to the fall in foreign Â»ljÂ»- j

OIL MEN LIKELY
TO APPEAL FROM
ROSS DECISION
Authority of Commissioner of General
Land Offlce In Ordering "With
drawal Questioned â Opera
tions of Prospectors.
1
The claimants to oil lands in the State
of California affected by the recent de
cision of Judge Ross at Los Angeles num
ber thousands. Among the claims to
which the decision applies are some of the
finest oil properties In the State. The de
cision has caused excitement from one
end of the State to the other. Those who
as placer locators rested secure In the be
lief that the withdrawal of lands from
entry temporarily by the authorities at
Washington meant that they were fav
ored as against the scrlppers are now
sorry they did not send a man to Wash
ineton long ago to care for their inter
ests. The scrlppers are jubilant, but there
Is general expectation that an appeal will
be taken from Judge Ross' decision.
The interests involved amount to mil
lions. A conservative estimate would be
520,000,000 posslblj, based on the theoretical
ami prospective value of lands that a few
years ago were worth, in several sections
at least where oil has since been discov
ered,'only a nominal price. In the Federal
courts and in the United States Land OI-,
flcti are great numbers of cases undecided.
In, which the Issue is practically the same
as that involved In the Olive Land \ and
i Development Co. vs. William H. Olmstead
et al., which is the case decided by Judge
Ro^h These are scattered throughout Los
Angeles, Santa Barbara. San Bernardino.
Kern, Fresno and other counties where
the placer locator has been and has found
the scripper. â¢ -. .*
i There are two classes of scrlppers in
fact, If not before the law. One class is
made up of those who have surrendered
lands to the Government and have Im
mediately claimed other . lands In lieu.
The other class of scrippers' Includes
those who never had any Government
latid originally, but who have â¢ bought
scrip at one rate or another. These scrip
purchasers have paid brokers In this city
or elsewhere at the rate of $5 per acre.
Where they will come out is another ques
tion if the Ross decision is sustained.
Two lawyers employed by the Southern
Pacific Company were concerned In a suit
in which the scrlppers and the placer lo
cators were opposed, some time ago.
There is a suspicion among the placer lo
cators that the Southern Pacific Company
is concerned in the final outcome of oil
Ross decides ir. the most positive
terms that those who have surrendered
Government lands and taken others In
lieu have good title. Scrippers may enter
upon almost any alleged mineral claim
and, if the mineral entry Is first made,
the scripper holds the title if the mineral
(oil) has not been already demonstrated
to exist in the claim. This is in accord
ance with a ruling of the Secretary of the
Interior and also with a prior decision In
the Federal court, which made actual
discovery of oil the only* tenable basis on
which the- placer locator, could-, hold the
land. Â¦ * :-.-"Â»-.:'i- Â¦> -Â¦; Â¦Â¦? s^ â¢Â¦''â¢;Â¦ ;
Many original placer locators took time
by the forelock some time ago, when a
cloud of trouble appeared on their hori
zon and covered their land, already, locat
ed under the placer mining law, vwlth
scrip, purchased. from brokers, that they
might hold on, no matter which way, the
question was finally - decided. Â¦.: There: are

finding- oil in the land taken by the scrip
per was of no importance, nor, he says, is
it of any importance in view of the pro
visions of the statute under consideration,
that the selection here in question may
have been made in the hope of finding oil
in the land. The statute conferring the
right of selection does not make that right
in any way depend upon the Intent with
which It is made. (Iron Silver Mining
Company vs. Reynolds. 124. U. S., 374; Sul
livan vs. Iron Silver Mining .Company, 143
U. S. v . 431.) Should doubt exist as to the
character of any of the public lands stand-
Ing upon the books of the local land of
fices as open to settlement, to which no
valid right has attached, it is undoubtedly
within the power of the officers of the
General I^and Office to withdraw them
from settlement or sale pending an in
quiry as to their true character. And such
action, it is understood, has recently been
taken by the Land Department in respect
to some of the public lands in California,
which surface indications and the charac
ter of adjacent lands tended to show are
oil lands. ' Lands so withdrawn are, of
course, not open to settlement, and there
fore not subject to selection- under the act
of June 4, 1897, in lieu of any land relin
quished to the United States. But they
continue open to exploration for minerals,
and when mineral Is found therein to loca
tion under the'mining laws if the land be
at the time' unappropriated. And even
where such discovery is made subsequent
to a prior location, if the location be oth
erwise valid that fact is held to be Imma
terial,' provided.- always, that no rights
of others have.. Intervened before compli
ance by. the locator with all of*the statu
tory requirements. (Nevada-Sierra Oil
Company vs. Home Oil Company, supra,
and cases there cited.)
Not much comfort is derived by placer
locators on oil land from. the remarks of
Judge Ross concerning the exemption of
lands withdrawn, because they question
the authority of the ComnrhiKlQner of the
General Land Offlce to order. such with
drawal. As far back as March 23 last
Judge John M. Wright, speaking before
the executive committee of the California
Miners' Association, advocating the pro
posed amendment to the petroleum act of
February 11, 1SS7. said:
The. Commissioner of the General Land Office
has undertaken to suspend the operation of the
land lawn on those various tracts. Has he a
right to prevent any man from going upon
that land?" Merely" to * state "fhls" question sug

that'thSs suspension .can last but a short time
and that.. when it is removed, something muat

that have been encountered will once again
confront every, man who wants land In those
regions and more difficulties besides.

quandary. It will be seen that there are
elements enough to make up a good sized
and very bitter controversy yet.
The decision of Judge Ross came to
many, like a thunderbolt from a clear
/sky. .Only last week the Han ford Jour
nal, for Instance, was advising placer
claimants that there was an Indication
that the lands withdrawn from . entry
would soon be thrown open. The Los An
geles Times, reviewing the Judge Ross
decision, describes it as "startling." No
decision in years has involved greater
present and prospective interests in this
State.
Some placer locators who reside in this
city have believed that the scripper must,
in order to hold lieu lands, make affi
davit that such lands are agricultural.
Judge Ross was emphatic on the point
therein involved. The only condition that
is imposed upon the scripper in making
his selection is that he takes lands "va
cant and open to settlement." The text
of the decision on that point is as follows:
The power to select is by the statute given
to the party who is invited to make the ex
change, provided always that he confine* his
selection to the class of lands described in the
statute, to wit: Those vacant and open for
settlement. No other condition la imposed by
the statutes. '
Judge Ross also decided that the hope of
tlons. neir registrations, transfers and can
cellations.
As to Primary Elections.
By the addition of fifteen ney sections
to the Political Oode by aot approved March
3. 1SS!I (Statutes 1VX*. page 47), a new scheme
for the holding of primary .-lections Is pro
vided. In so far us this inuuiry is con
cerned, it Is only necessary to state that
the register and supplements thereto to be
used at the primary election* so provided
tlcal Code* This Eection is exactly similar
to section HIS of the Political Code, above
referred to. ,
There had i,rt then been up to and includ
ing March 3. 1SS9. in so far as registers and
nupi'lenientt thereto to be used at the State
rrinjury elections were concerned, any
change, and what has been said with refer
ence to the register and supplemental reg
ister provided for l>y section 111S of the Po
litical Cede applied with equal force to sec
tion 1375 of tne Political Code, as above
stated.
Changes in the Form.
On March 4. 1S?3, by an act of the Legis
lature approved on that day, but taking
effect January 1, 1900, certain changes were
made in the" form of the registers to be
used at elections throughout the State, and
likewise .is to the time for registration.
Inder this new scheme the register is in
the form of affidavits (1103 and 1H3, Political
Code Statutes IWK page Â«J2>. which must
"within fifteen days after the last day of
registration" be bound by the clerk.
Within five days after the binding of these
affidavit.^: of registration the clerk must pre
pare Â»n index of each book (section 1115,
Political Code. Statutes 1SSW. page 62) and
must before the day of election, have de
livered to the Board of Election tn each pre
cinct one of such books of affidavits, which
should constitute the register to be used at
Euch election.
Political Code Amended.
Section 1CS4 of the Political Code was like
wise amended (Statutes 1839, page Â«'), and
as amended required that In "each even
numbered year" " a new and complete reg
istration of the voters" of the State should
be had. Such registration was to begin on
the first day of January of such years and
shall be In proeress at all times, except
forty days immediately preceding any elec
tion, when lt shall cease, but transfers from
one creclnct or ward to another in the same
county may be made at any time, except
twenty-five days immediately preceding any
such election.
Section 10S3 of the Political Code was like
wise amended fPtautes 1859. page 60), the
only change being the substitution of the
phrase "and who has conformed to the law
place of the phrase "and whose name should
be enrolled on the great register of such
county fifteen days prior to an election,"
after "the words "thirty days." As stated
the amendments to' the sections mentioned
by act approved March 4. U99. took effect
January 1, 1W0. Hence, under section 1094
registration of voters commences on the
first day of January "in each even-num
bered vear." but not time is specificaily
provided for the last day of registration
mentioned in section 1113 of the Political
Code, supra, other than a general provision
that the regit-tration shall cease forty and
twenty-five days immediately preceding any
election. It is evident that the Legislature
Intended that registration should cease "for
the year" forty and transfer twenty-five
days before the general election held In the
even-numbered years.
Time Limit Specified.
Unless the l^eislature intended that the
registration and transferrine were complete
hpve required the affidavits of registration
to be bound in book form within fifteen
dnys after the last day of resistration and
indexed within five days thereafter; nor
can it be presumed that all who desire to
vote .it the comlne general ejection in No
vember have reeistered forty days prior to
the second Tuesday of August. lfiOO. the date
of the approaching primary election.
Furthermnre, by section 136S of the Politi
cal Code ad-ied in is;<9. primary elections
shall be conducted, managed and controlled
in the same manner as an election for State,
district, etc., officers, except as otherwise
provided in part III. title 11, chapter 54.
By section 1261 of the Political Code, the
election board must seal and direct to the
County Clerk the copy of the register used
at the election. By section 126S of the
Political Code, as sor.n as the returns of the
election are canvassed the Clerk must file
the reeister returned in his office.
Special Provision Made.
Accordingly we find that the legislature
has specially provided for the register to
be used at primary elections in case regis
tration in the even-numbered years, as pro
vided by section 1054 of the Political Code,
ehouM not be completed at the time of hold-
Ing the primary election. Section 1375 of
the Political Code, surra, after providing
for the qualifications of electors at primary
elections reads as follows:
'"Provided, that where a new registra
tion pursuant to law is not completed in
tlrr.e sufficient t~> permit of its use at the
next ensuing primary election, then the
register used at the last general election In
any county or city and county in this State
may be used at any primary election, to
gether with supplemental registers or ad
ditions, ehowlng all additional registration
changes and corrections made eince the
last general registration."
Terms Well Defined.
As heretofore stated, the terms "register"
ar.d "supplemental reElaters" were well de
fined and understood terms when section
1375 of the Political Code was adopted. The
amendments to section 1094 of the Political
Cod", requiring re-regiFtratlon commencing
January 1. U00. and to the other sections of
the Political Code chansine the form of the
rrgiFters to be used at the election through
out the State, were not adopted until March
4. lf?9. to take effect January 1, 1300
1S99. page 69). whereas, section
1375 of the Political Code was in effect
March 3. 18?3 (Statutes 1S93. page 47).
"While it is true section 1Â«>4 providing; for
the registers was amended and section 1114
providing for the supplemental registers
wan rcr>ealed, said amendmentÂ»and repeal
taking effect January 1, liWO. jet. never
theless, in arriving at tne true meaning of
these words, an used In section 1375, supra,
under well settled rules of statutory con
struction, we are. entitled to refer to these
sections as they stood at the time of the
adoption of section 1373.
The Laws Harmonize.
Tills construction harmonizes all of the
sections o" the code herein referred to and
doe* violence to none..
I therefore concur with you in thft opinion
that under eection 1375 of the Political Code,
it Is the duty of the officers who prepare
registers for the general election to pre
pare Fupplements (â¢Â¦) the reglFter used at
the last general elec,tlrn. Such supplement
ehall show all additional registrations,
ehansce and corrections which do not ap
pear on the rrBifter at the, la?t general elec
tion. Kuch puppl<?mt nt should be prepared
in form corresponding to the register uÂ»,ed
at the laj?t eenetal election, and the register
used at the lant general election, together
with such supplement, shall be the register
which must be used at the primary election
to be held on the second Tuesday of Augrust.
1300.
The constitutionality of the "Stratton
Primary Law," so called, is now before
the SuDreme Court for decision. In cltlne
th* provisions of this law we have neceÂ»
fiarlly assumed that it is a valid enactment.
t'pon this question, however, we express no
opinion.
You have also discussed the question of
