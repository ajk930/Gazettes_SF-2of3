A New Memory System.
My friend, Micah Miggle.=i, has a system
of mnemonics all his own. When he'
wishes to remember one word he thinks
of another that may sound quite different,
but that bears some relation of. ideas to
the word he seeks to retain. Thus, if you
told hint to buy a pair of socks he would
immediately think of the word "sock
dolager," and, ten to one, when he ar
rived at the store the word Would have
turned into doxology. and he would come ;
back with a hymn-book. So his system i
ha3 its faults, but Miggles swears by It,
and once in a while he evolves a triumph
in his line.
Last week his wife asked him to stop at
Munnimaker's and buy a few things for
her. He immediately made a list so that
he should not forget. I was with him
when he drew out h's list at Munni
maker's.
â¢"Hello!" said he. "what's all this royal j
family about? I can't think whether it
was books or kitchen utensils that Mrs.
Miggles asked me to get."
This after reading his list:
"What's on the list?" I asked.
"Why, I made it out in my system, you
know, and I can't think of the key to it.
'I've got to have a start always. It says
'King Henry V., one Prince of Wales, one
Duke of York, Queen Victoria and Mar-
quis of Lome, too." "
"Why. it's historical works or photo
graphs." said I; but I was really quite in
the dark.
"No," said Miggles. "Just help me to
think. I'm sure it wasn't books or pic
tures. I think It was dry goods."
Quite accidentally I put him on the
track. If I hadn't, in spite of his system
he would have gone home without a
bundle, and. as he is a commuter, that
would have been a little irregular.
"What Is King?" said I. half to myself.
."Ha!" said Migglcs; "thanks. Cotton i.i
king â old expresrion. Cottonâ "Kin^
Henry V equals five yards of cotton."
"Good!" said I. "But what in thunder
is 'one Prince of 'Wales?' "
"Prince â prince â prints â cne yard of
prints!" and Miggles laughed with joy.
"There is more in that systcxa than I
thought," said I. "But what can you
make out of 'one Duke of York?" "
"Duke â duke â duke. Du'.:e â duchess. H.i!
one yard duchess lace."

in the sound of her voice rushes toward
her and the game is soon under way. All
join hands and the leader- starts the fun
by choosing Kitty Casey to stand in the
center of the ring, while her companions
revolve round her and sing. Strange as
it may secern the children have imbibed
enough knowledge about "love" from
their elders that each not only has a beau
but has thoughts of being united to the
lad of their choice when they have reach
ed womanhood. Each child also knows
in whose keeping her companion's little
heart is and in their games the fortunate
youth's name is heard wilh frequency.
does not prevent their gefting as much
enjoyment out of the games as the initi
ated.
As will be observed In the foregoing
lines, the unknown author of them, while
not a -poet of high order, knew how to
please the cliildren, because he ends the
1 verse with promises of future happiness.
The song being concluded, Kitty Casey
jrins hands and Mayzie Jackson takes
her station in the ring. It does not mat
ter whether Mayzie' s hands and face are
daubed with smirches of mud, because her
companions well know she has attended a
cooking school in a back lot and has
learned the receipe for making mud pies.
Mayxle has a "fellow" and Is as proud as
any little lady in the land. When his
name is heralded, Miss Jackson's blushes
can be discerned through the dirt which
begrimes her face, but this Is lost on her
companions, who are busily engaged in
singing the following verse:
Rain, rain high and the winds blow cold
And the storm is gathering to and fro.
And Mayzie Jackson says she'll die,
Die for a fellow with a roeuish eye.
She is handsome, 6he is pretty;
She is the belle of San Francisco city.
She has a loved one, one, two, three;
Please do tell me who he'll be.
Freddie Cohen says he'll have her;
All the boys are fighting for her. -
Let them all say what they will,
Freddie Cohen will have her still.
Mayzie's love story having been told to
her satisfaction, sbe returns to her old
place in the revolving circle and Sadla
Watson is chosen to the place of honor.
"Without delay Sadie hears the following
news:
All the boys in our town lead a happy life.
Excepting Frankie Walker, and he want* a
wife.
A wife he shall have, a-courting he shall go.
Whence these songs originated is lost
in dim obscurity. Suffice it to say they
have been handed down through suc
ceeding generations and will never die
out. They are the rightful property of
the children and nothing can dispossess
them of ownership. Half of them do not
know the meaning of the verses, but. this
Rain, vain high and the wlnds'blow cold ,
And the storm is trathering to and fro;
And Muyzie Jackson sajs she'll die.
Die for a fellow with a roguish eye.
The strains of this childish song filled
the air. It could be heard above the din
of clanging street car bells and passing
trucks.
A half dozen "tykes" just out of school
were engaged in play and they looked as
contented as hou?=e cats. They were re
volving round a little girl, whose large
black eyes sparkled with pride \ at the
homage accorded her. The street wad
crowded with pedestrians and many of
them paused in their hurry and scurry to
the marts of trade to listen to the sweet
voices raised In joyous song. A feeling
of sympathy was depicted on the faces of
many of the auditors. Fond recollections
of their own childhood returned to them.
Like a panorama the early years of their
own life passed before their eyes. If you
have never had the infinite pleasure of
listening to these rhymes, you have miss
ed an experience which is as delightful as
any one could desire. The songs are
peculiarly the property of tho children of
the poorer classes. To hear them proper
ly sung, one needs only to pass through
any of the small streets of an afternoon
and their ears will drink in the tuneful
songs.
All the Rirls having been the center of
attraction durins: the rendition of the
foregoing sonps. th.y play "ring around

Children's Songs
and GamesAteyzte, will you walk with me?
Mayzie turns up her little nose and de
clines to be bribed. Whereupon the leader
tries again:
I will give you a golden spoon
To feed your baby in the afternoon.
Mayzie. will you walk?
Mayzie, will you talk?
ilayzie, will you walk with me?
The tempting offer has little effect on
Mayzie, and again she spurns the tempter.
The latter retains hope of victory, and
continues:
I will give you a golden chair
To sit In the garden and take fresh air.
Mayzie. will you walk?
Mayzie, will you talk?
Mcyzle, will you walk with me?
The tempted, being but human, begins
to falter and weakly answers in the nega

goal, and she sings:
I will give you a golden carriage
To go to the church and then get married.
Mayzie, will you walk?
Mayzie, will you talk?
Mayzie, will you walk with me?
The leader tires of offering such costly
gifts for the privilege of walking and
talking to Mayzie, so she stakes all on the
throw and when she imparts the- follow
ing- information to the tempted, victory
crowns her efforts and a ray of sunshine
has entered her young life:

days Mrs. David abandoned house

and the hci:re was ready for occupancy. . ..
"I shall never forget the day I drove. euit
here to the house." said Mr. David, aa -
he sat on the porch at home and looked .
proudly about him. "I had lain, there, in,
bed day after day. wondering what sort .
of a thins my brave wife was trying to
get together for our home. But when I
turned yonder.foothills and saw from the
carriage this house and knew that It was .
one-third of my own wife's skill and hard,
labor I could scarcely control my emotion.
I halve never had anything appeal to m*
so pathetically. We moved up here live '
weeks ago, and I don't know whether it is
my pride at having the most v/onderful
Â¦wife that' ever lived or whether it's the'
high, dry climate, but I'm recovering my
health up here faster than anywhere ever
before. There's a lot more work to be
done en this house yet. and we are r.ot
showing it off as a piece of superior ar
chitectural skill. Eut It's my -wife's own
work, and the only house built sq,much by
a woman that I ever knew. or' heard of."
she had planned .to build a comfortable
house there for a few hundred dollars,
he said it was a pity she should throw"
away such sweet optimism on such hope
less prospects.
"I suppose you know, my dear, that
there's less than $1000 of our fortune
left," he whispered.
"Oh, yes; but I've some plans of my
own that you don't know about," came
the confident reply.
Mrs. David planned and planned all
that night, while her husband thought
her fast asleep. She was up at daybreak
and when breakfast was over she hired
a woman neighbor to come and care for
her husband and child while she went
about executing her plans. Her heart
seemed like lead, but she did not let a
soul know but that she was the most
blithesome, chipper person In town.
She went over to Colton and trotted
about for hours among .carpenters and
lumber dealers. She drew rough plans of
a house such as she vlshed, got esti
mates for the lumber and asked ten
thousand questions about housebuilding
and how and where to economize In put
ting up a house. The next day Mrs. Da
vid had a lawyer friend fix her legal
entry upon the Government claim, and
the first load of lumber was hauled to
the'site of the house, when Mr3. David
had paid the lumber bill and Insisted up
on all the discounts coming to her.
That was on February 18. The Colton
people will still tell with smiles and In
glowing .worda of praise for the plucky
little woman how frequently during those
February days they saw pretty and joung
Mrs. David seated alongside a veteran
local carpenter and the driver of the
lumber company's wagon, on loads of
shingles, red-Wood boards and pine scan
tlings on the way to the site of the pro
posed house miles away over in the foot
hills out of town. The Colton people say
the scene of the prepossessing little
Yankee blonde, with a serviceable som
brero over her flaxen locks and wearing
a light blouse and new denim overalls,
looking the picture of contentment and
determination as she rode man fashion,
on the loads of lumber, was one worth .
going miles to sec. Every one In Colton^
and Riverside who knows the circum
stances of the case glories' in the un
daunted energy of Mrs. David: ' '.
The work on the^Httlahome began with
(Â«the first load of Jumper on the scene.'
Every day Mrs. David went there with
the lona white-haired carpenter at 7 In .
the morning and she returned with* him
at evening. She "worked hard and labor
iously under the old carpenter's orders.
She did a man's work. Â£^lie sawed, planed,
carried lumber, chiseled holes for Joists
and drove nails and spikes. Her hands .
ached and grew horny under their labor.
The carpenter says she was the most pro
ficient apprentice he ever had. In a week
she had the run of how lumber was to be
handled and a "thousand and one paints
about the handling of tools as her car
penter bess did. She wore out two pairs
of overalls In n month and a pair of
leather mittens every week. She says she
was often terribly weary, but only her
abiding zeal to have a home for her sick
husband, and her child and owe nothing
upon it kept her at her n*ard labor. At
night she dropped asleep almost while at
the table.
Every noon she got out her dinner pall
and sitting on a pile of lumber of a saw
horse she end the old carpenter ate their
meal from their tin palls. When the work
of the day was done they climbed Into the
carpenter's platform wagon and together
they rode back to town. "The hardest,
work of all when we were building the"
house," said Mrs. David, In telling of
those days, "was when I bade my poor
husband and my little baby sood-by and
started out at dawn to do more work and
thereby get a home so much cheaper."

Back In a litter of miscellaneous th!r.g3
In the rear of n busy 'little whop on Six
teenth street, owned by T. , Musgrove,
medals of all descriptions are being made
st an astcundlnp rate. Out of Bold and
silver and all sorts of metals queer de
eigns arc bans' curiously wrought, each
emblematic of par excellence in some
particular line. The designer begins the
Genesis of the process and the Revela
tion aro performed by the man who en
amels and polishes. Between theso two
stages there is much of cutting,, tracing,
engraving, baking, heating and â¢ many
other thing? that Jewelers do.
The designer evolves from the Idea
given him by the person who orders the
medal an art,'stlc creation in pencil or pen
tracing, representing the medal as it 1Â»
to appear when finished. After beinj?
approved the drawing is submitted to the
tngraver, to whom the goldsmith hands
over the medal, prepared in proper pro
portions and beaten to the required thick
ness:. With curious little Haws dnd knives
the eneraver {roes to v.-prk, following. out
the indications of the drawing in the
pieces of metal, executing the design In
a number of sections. Meanwhile the en
ampler has been grinding Into dust a curi
ous kir.d of glass, which he mixes Into a
paste. The portions of the engraved trac
ings, fcuch ns letters, flowers, etc., which
are to be enameled, are then filled In with
the paste , mixture and the medal is put
to bake. When thoroughly done the
roughness of the enamel is ground away
in some manner known to the jeweler, in
volving the use of emery paper, chamois
cloth and such things: then the sections
are given a high polish and put together.
When, behold, the medal is complete
ready for the fittest in the struggle for
survival.
The accompanying cuts of medals aro
those prepared for the coming school con
tests of the Santa Clara College, and the
patterns are wrought after the designer's
conception of what tho time-honored cusÂ«
torn of modal awarding demands. The en
graver and the enamelcr have attended
to the execution, and the-medals are glint
ing brightly on their tinted velvet cush
ions, awaiting such time as their wlnnera
are determined.
hard. Keeping the doctor's words a close
secret, she revolved the idea of a home
in the foothills over and over in her mind
for a week. At last she reached a de
cision. Something had tobe done, und done
soon. Leaving her husband and baby in
the care of a slster-ln-la w. who came on
from Topeka, Kans.. young Mrs. David
hired a carriage, drove lif teen miles out
into the country and went on foot all
over the lonely foothill region that skirts
the base of the towering San Bernardino
Mountains southwest from Colton. She
found a spotâ six miles from the nearest
settlerâ where a little water might he had
among the desolate hills. H had once
teen taken up as a Government land
claim .and then had. been abandoned. It
could be had for comparatively nothing.
There the brave little woman decided to
build a house for her ranr.ly.
Â¦When M rs. David' returned to her nus
band's bedside late that afternoon she
told him how she had found the very spot
for him to make another light for new
lungs -and renewed life! She was sure
a natural sanitarium for weak lungs had
been found by herself. Hut the sick hus
band only smilod at her plans and en
thusiasm. When, however, she' told how

Mrs. Iiavid opened a studio, 'did Chinese
scenes in water colors and made family
expenses by her holiday orders. ' She had
offers of a large salary to gj and paint
in water colors In a Sari Francisco art
establishment, but the doctors said her
husband could r.ot endure the climate of
the seashore. So die declined the iffer.
Last January the Davids moved farthei
Inlandâ to Riversideâ where it was hoped
that the dryer .itrncsphcre would benefit
the invalid's lungs. The family purse hao
sadly shrunken, and. moreover, there
fecmed no prospect Â«'f checking the
shrinking. One day early in February,
while Mr. David was very ill In bed, a
physician in Riverside told Mrs. David
that the only hope for her husband's re
covery was to live In a_^ high, dry spot,
where there would !,-e no worry about
finances and where lie might live cheaply
and close to natureâ ju^t Â«s Robert Louis

hemorrhage, the severest he ever suf
fered, once more laid him low. â¢ The lit

Family expenses and ceaseless profes
sional services made heavy draughts upon
the family funds. A friend to whom Mr.

Mrs. David worked like a Trojan for a
month In getting the place to rights for
the Influx of summer boarders. The
place shone like a new dollar and
everything was pptck and span. Ah, the
hopes the young couple had -built for a
prosperous season there! It was the last
day of May, lSLtf. Everything but a few
chairs and some bedding was ready for

should have perf#rmÂ«*<l the work of a craft

credit should bo given the young lady.
Among i he people who came from the

his wife and !<a!jy. Mr. David was about
twenty-seven years old. an electrical en
gineer, a graduate of the Sheffield Scien

of a French college of engineers. Mr.--.
David was a plump little blnc-eyod. rosy
chtekrd, very handsome woman of about
twenty-three. Her Jolly ways, her supe
rior education and her devotion to her
husband and child made her friends at
the Lea Angeles hotels, where the family
llved for a feu- months. Mrs. David was
a former student at WtKcsley College at
WeUesley. Mass., for two years, ai:d spent
three \f^r? in a Paris art school, when;
she met* her husband. Her father was
Hiram EL Wiison. who was the London
representative of cotton mills at Fall

inherited his fine, fortune and lived with a
wealthy aunt on Washing! ">n street, near

Around the paris Exposition
11In these war times- It -does not come
amiss to Inform ourselves upon past great
deeds and events In our own history. ."A
book of interest viewed in this light Is
that recently published on the storming
of Stony Point by General Anthony Wayne
at midnight -of July 15. 1779. The story Is
admirably told by Professor Henry P.
Johnstonâ an author well qualified. to pre
sent an excellent work, upon an episode
heretofore but meagerly given. While this
brilliant attack of the Americans so care
fully planned by Washington and daringly
executed by "Mad Anthony" is now little
more than a historical . memory in tho
minds of the people of the -present day
It was ot the time regarded as of the
most vital importance. It was. the de
cisive blow of the year, for It meant the
capturing of a generally considered im
pregnable position, with comparatively lit
tle bloodshed â a loss to' the English of
prestige, stores and an Important forti
fication. The Americans of that day went
wild. over the success. It meant as much
then: as some of our own surprisingly
brilliant episodes of the Spanish war mean
to-day and was the cause for the writing
of. many official letters of congratulation
and widespread" rejoicing. . .
The present. work contains, by way of
illustration and explanation, many rare
maps. Among the Jlf ty-slx .documents In
"Stony Point'* there are two new letters
from Washington ; four, from Sir Henry
Clinton, the British commander, in chief;
two from Lord Germain, Minister of .War
in London, one of which contains, the
King's regret and alarm at the defeat;
one from the British, Peace Commissioner,
Eden, . and over twenty-five I others -from
Generals Heath, McDougall, George 'Clin
ton, Colonels Feblger, Scammell, Putnam
and others, which are now published for
the first time, throwing much light on the
operations of 1778 and 1779 ' and Stony
Point In particular. .Few of the remaining

The book adds little to what is already
well known to the average reader who has
followed the reports in the newspapers of
the events around Manila. Mr. Sheridan,
a civilian who had never seen war, was
naturally shocked by much of what went
on around the captured city, and his sym
pathies turned to the side of the weaker
as Is common. His book . will be of no
permanent value as it Is mainly, a record
of individual experience, Interspersed with
copies of official proclamations issued by
the American authorities or by the Fili
pinos, Btlll it contains a record of an Im
portant event in our. history from the
standpoint of an eyewitness who, while a
foreigner, -was not prejudiced against us.

tunity it affords us of seeing ourselves as

"The Dishonor of Frank Scott," by a
new English author. M. Hamilton, will be
published shortly by Harper & Brothers.
Those who have read the manuscript say
that a most unusual and startling plot Is
involved and that the tale is full of novel
and surprising situations. The publishers
believe that the book will be a great suc
cess among all classes of American novel
readers, and will excite a great deal of
comment.
The tales contained In L. Frank Baum's
latest children's book, "A New Wonder
land," are unlike any ever before written,
dealing with a series of adventures In a
country so absolutely unique that the
book will lead its readers into untrodden
fields of wonderment. Yet the stories are
as sweet and wholesome as they are won
derful, and the book is expected to be the
year's big hit In Juvenile literature, aa
"Father Goose" was last year. Frank
Ver Beck has illustrated it In hla most
humorous vein, and R. H. Russell Is pro
ducing the work In a way to make It a

J. A. Altsheler, whoso striking novel of
the Civil War, "In Circling Camps." Is
just published, was the cause of an amus
ing discussion when his earlier book, "A
Soldier of Manhattan," was published In
England. The English critics were en
thusiastic in their praise of the power
and Interest of the book as a novel, but
Mr. Altsheler's patriotism In writing of
the relations of English and Americans
just before the Revolution was taken up
In the English press and made much of an
an evidence of the persistence of anti
' English feeling In this country. As Mr.
Altsheler was Influenced simply by a de
slre to preserve the actual spirit of the
time' m literary form the seriousness of
the English press over this imaginary
evidence of hostility to England had Its
entertaining slde^
That "nothing succeeds like success"
the. constantly growing subscription
list of the magazine Success amply
proves. That very readable and
practical monthly record of achieve
ment Is edited by one who may well be
styled, the modern successor to Samuel
Smiles, the famous author of "Self-Help."
Besides hl3 magazine work, Dr. Orison
Swett Marden, the editor of Success, has
issued a number of books bearing on the
same general topic as to how success is
won. . He has, however.' a new book in
press with - the Lothrop Publishing Com

that Is designed especially for young peo
pleâthe boys and girls of America who
are always Â¦ responsive to Inspiration and
incentive. These are precisely what Dr.
Marden will aim to give them in hla new

The conclusions of the author's study
so far as they affect the main monetary
question of this country are thus stated:
"The revolution Involved In the plans of
the silver men would be as fruitless of
good as It would be reactionary and reÂ«
trogressive in the choice of money ma
terial. The solid backing If not the con
scious motive of the movement resides
In the interests of Bllver property which
would secure an opening to the mints
and so to a bigger market. But why
should the Interest of sliver outweigh all
other commercial Interests? In magni
tude It is among the least of them; no
great agricultural or manufacturing or
mining Interest but surpasses it In any
of the leading countries of the world.
â¢ â¢ â¢ The value of the world's stock of
It is far from augmenting proportionally
with the bulk. Nor can a market be
given it that it will make it equally pre
cious with gold â not enough all the na
tions of the earth should build upon it
their currencies; a gold medal will always
overrank and outshine a silver medal, re
gardless of any positive convention. The
relations of the two values of substances
reside In the fixed natures of the sub
stances and of the man who estimates and
compares them. Any attempt to reverse
or alter the natural relation of any. two
things or entitles must end in dead fail
ure, preceded by more or less, disaster."

"Tbc Last of the Flatboats."
This is the story of the adventures of
five young "Hoosiers" who take about the
last of the Western river flatboats down
the Mississippi to New Orleans: They
start from the town of Vevay 'Â¦ on 1 ,' the
Ohio, and have plenty of adventure. But
the book Is more than a story of adven
ture: It Is a perfect storehouse of facts,
not only about the Mississippi and "its
interesting family of rivers," but of the
possibilities, productions and Incentives
which America yields and of which ac
tive, earnest and ambitious American
boys may profitably avail themselves.
Mr. Eggleston evidently writes from
close and careful knowledge. He has not
only dealt picturesquely ifrlth our Â¦wonder
ful Western' river system, but he has
covered a field, geographically, which no
boy's story has yet attempted." The five
boj-a take the "Last -of the Klatboa.ts," as
they call their craft, well laden with con
signments of farm produce, through the
. bends and rapids,-" the dangers and de
llgrbts of the erreat river, with "moving
accidents* by flood and field," and a vast
development In self-reliance, Intelligence

â¢nho make the voyagre. The Interest In
the book lg, heightened when It is hinted
that the orlclnal of "Ed"â the most
y*C this the <2ar of tho historical novel
it is a relief to find a cleverly written
I" bit of fiction that does not depend
upon the glamor of old-time dress, an
cient diction or stirring incident founded
upon "well authenticated fact." It is a
pleasure to read a story that deals with
contemporary flctlon and is good simply
because ?t is well told and is a true pic
ture of modern life. There is a young
r.uthorâ a Virsir.ian. by the way, as is
.Mary Johnston of "To Have and to Hold"
f-meâ who has written several good
*"Â«cks. but the last is the best of all. And
this last Is really a remarkable work â its
i;ood In its line as Miss Johnston's work
of pcpular favor is in the way of a his
torical novel. It is unfair to both these
vounp authors To compare the work of
either with the other, for Mary
Johnston's last book deals with
Virginian history of long ago and
Ellen Olasgow is "Voice of the Peo
ple" finds for Us theme Virginia of
the present day. One is a book of dra
matic action and the other a study of ihe
development of character. It Is only fair
to cay. however, that Miss Glasgow has
veil accomplished a more difficult task,
tr.d though the book may not have aÂ»
CTÂ«at a popular lun as "To Have and to
Hold" it is safe to state that it well de
rcrves as much attention. "To Have and
to Hold" is filled with dramatic situa
tions uv.d ttirrins adventuresâ plenty of
blood. ai:d we might add just a little
thunder. -The Voice of the People" is
not a bock of act!<~n. but still it contains
soir.e pu'ai climaxes for all that, and the
author's pen picture* of her character*
are splendidly drawn.
The story :s of Virginia of the present
dayâ political Virginia and plantation
Virginia. It is the life story of the effort
of one of the people to rise above ilis sta
tion, to marry out of his class and to be
cume a loader among men. There is no
complication of ptot, no gentle deceptions
to keep ihe readers curiosity on the qui
vivo, no claptrap playing to the galleryâ
ar.d yet :t is a book that once taken up
will not be put down until finished.
The hero is Nkk Uurr, who makes his
icltial api'farance in the s=tory as a little
red-headed urcivln, the son of a poor farm
er ol the low class, and yet at this early
age liiied with a desire to study law and
not follow in his father"? footstej.s &s a
tiller of the soil. He has uphill work of
It. and this is where Miss iJlasgov.' is
clever in her art: her stcry la so real and
entirely lacking in maudlin sentimentality
and exaggerated situations. Nick, the
lad. is oflVrt-d a chance to study with a
epeclal tutor of the children of the best
families of the village, and slowly ad
vances to the goal which his childish
fancy has set. The gradual development
and tiroadeninsr of this farmers boy is
exceptionally well done, and not a bit
overdone. He has everything to over
come; the class hatred against him; his
father's entire lack of sympathy in his
work; the < or.ftant drag of the farm work,
which he kef ps up in addition to his stud
ies. Nick wins his friends as he goes, but
bis main standby ar.d sympathizer is his
stepmother, a woman always linding fault
with him and his work and yet ready to
wear f.tr fingers to the bor.e in his cause.
A most pathetic character is this crea
ture, who knows naught else but poverty,
sickness and toil, and yet expects nothing
more from life; neither happy nor discon
tented, because she has no time to think
of her lot.
Alter Nick has educated himself suf
ficiently he receives an offer to enter a
lawyer's office and etudy haw. It seems
loo pood to be true, and he can hardly
contain himself now that his long-cher
ished dream is about to be realized. Then
comes the reverseâ the skillful twist of the
author to strengthen her storyâ for he
f.ndi that in order to save his father's
larrn from mortgage he must take a more
lucrative position in the village store and
tell Hour and ribbons. To narrate all the
obstacles which are met with and over
coir.e by this eon of the people would be
Lut commonplace statements of reverses
and suceffs. It is Miss Glasgow's faculty
of making her characters teem living
person-j whom the reader feels he knows
as friends and enemies, that imparts the
great interest to all these trials and tri
umphs, and not the mere repetition of dra
matic cveiits.
Nick falls in love with a girl out of his
class and with him, but the match
comes to nothing, and she weds a man of
her own social position in life. Their love
affair is. really one of undying affection
end t-steem. and yet neither of their lives
is broken by this separation. Even the
reader cannot l;e!p feeling that it is all for
the hept. fo subtle is the author's pen In
picturing Southern feelings and life.
Nick Burr attains the goal that he has
to long struggled forâ he Is elected tha
Governor of the State, defeating his
former sweetheart's husband in the race
for office. He dies true to his high princi
ples In endeavoring to rescue a criminal
negro from the hands of a lynching party.
In "The Voic? of the People" Ellen Glas
gow has given us a good, wholesome novel
with a healthy, normal, moral tone, and
yet fully as interesting as It Is meritorious.

"Problems of Expansion."
As editor of one of the leading American
newspapers, cx-Slinieter to France, special
Exnbassador on the occasion of Queen Vic
toria's jubilee and a negotiator of the
treaty of peace between America and
Spain, it is natural that Whitelaw Reid
eho'jld take a keen and intelligent interest
In the prob!e-ms of expansion, and his book
bearing that title shows how broad a view
he takes of questions which the parties in
interest are apt to regard too narrowly.
The author has been well known as an ex
pansionist ever since the appearance of
"The Territory With Which We Are
Threatened," In the Century for Septem
ber. 1S9S â almost simultaneously with his
appointment to the Paris conference, and
his views were plainly expressed at the
White House before the delegates received
the'r Instructions from the President.
Some of the aspects under which he con
siders the. general subject are indicated
by the titles of the several essays and ad
Â«5r^?=!?e^: "The Duties of Peace." "The
Open Door," "Our New Interests," "A
Continental Union." etc. To Mr. Reid's
Ion? -Tcj??rienee as an editorial writer and
political speaker are largely due the clear
ness and cogency of his utterances, and
writers and speakers in the_ coming Presi
dential campaign are likely to turn these
rages often for facto and arguments on

"When the American-Spanish war was de

the protection of a weak people from the
cruelties of a merciless oppressor. I was
an enthusiastic advocate of America's hu

prepared to sacrifice the blood and lives
of their citizens at any cost in order that
justice should be done, and the weak
emancipated from tyranny and deception.

Literary Notes.
It Is interesting to learn that portions of
Miss Cholmondeley's work in "The Dan
vers Jewels" are almost autobiographical.
"Stoke Moreton." the country house of
the Danvers family, is In reality Con
dover Hall, Shropshire, where the author
spent many of her happiest years, and the
theatricals which play so prominent a
part in the story actually took place there
snortly before the story was written.
Certain characters in "Red Pottage" are
also taken from life, the original of Dick
Vcrnon being no other than the novelist's
younger brother.
An important book will be shortly is

There is promise of very considerable dis

to lovers of animals and the farming fra
ternity. >It is a work on "The Law of
Animals" â a treatise on property in ani
mals wild *and domestic and the rights
and responsibilities arising therefrom.
The book numbers 800 pages of excellently
compiled matter and covers the legal as
pect of the animal kingdom from the
humble oyster to the elephant. No simi
lar work has eve,r been published, and
this book, covering as It does all the stat
utes, reports, digests and textbooks on
the subject, should prove most satisfac
tory to any practicing attorney. It is
certainly the quickest way that he can
find authority on any troublesome ques
tion connected with the rights of the ani
mal kingdom as recognized by the laws
of the United States. The author first
considers wild animals, including the
birds of the air, the beasts of the forests
and the tlsh of the sea: then he gives a
chapter on "domestic animals, with some
interesting paragraphs on the legal status
of the dog and the evident advancement
this trustworthy brute has made in the
esteem of man. Other chapters are
taken up with the following heads:
"Sale and Mortgage," "Estrays," "Injur
ing and Killing Animals," "Theft and
Removal of Animals," "injuries to Ani
mals on Highways," "Liabilities of Own
ers of Animals," "Bailment and Car

juries to Animals by Railways." The
perusal of such a book as this affords
profit of more kinds than one.-The author
concludes his preface in these words; "If
the technical textbook writer might hope
to encroach somewhat on 'the province ot
the poet and the naturaJist and awake in
his readers a deeper interest in our rights

right to proper protection and kindness

time and labor spent on the present work

Robert Grant's new novel. "Unleavened
Rread." has given rise to a great deal of
discussion, one n?pect of which deals In
cidentally with the origin and significance
of the title. Henry A. Clapp. well known
for nearly a generation as the dramatic
critic of the Boston Dally Advertiser and
recognized as one of the foremost Shake
spearean scholars of the United States,
advances a most interesting conjecture on
this point a3 a preface to a long review
of Mr. Grant's novel in the Daily Adver
tiser.
"There is not In the book." says Mr.
Clapp, "a phiaso or a word which directly
conveys the author's idea In choosing
this name. It is possible that he means
only to indicate a kind of breadâ an J. In
a figure, a type of character â Â¦which 13
hard, dry and" unpalatable. But a
shrewder guess may be mafe at his inner
thought. He'mfty have in mind a great
passage from one of St. Paul's most fa
mous letters, wherein the apostle bids his
correspondents to keep a certain great
feast 'not with the oUl leaven, neither
wiih the leaven of malice and wicked
ness, but with the unleavened bread of
sincerity ami truth.' Translated out of
the Hebrew metaphor, then, the title of
the novel \voul<? be 'Sincerity and Truth."
The reader will scon discover that the*
name is ironical."
Mr. Clapp. in conclusion, pronounces
"Unleavened BreaJ" "a very remarkable
novel, rich in ileas. strong in high appeal,
of great interest to all students of life
and character, and especially to every
American who loves his country and de
sires the best of things for her."
Jack London, the author of "The Son ot
the Wolf." published by Messrs. Hough
ton, Mifflin & Co.. is a .young man. not
yet twenty-fcur years old. His father
Â¦was Pennsylvania-born, a soldier, scout.
barkwoodpnan. trapper and wanderer.
His mother was horn in Ohio. ,I5oth went
West independently, meeting and marry
ing in San Francisco., where Mr. London
was born. The pioneer spirit was strong
In his ancestors, and the unrest of it
seems to have descended to him.
His early life was spent en California
ranches, but when he was nine years o!<i
the family removed to Oakland. Cal.
Since his ninth year, with the exception
of the hours spent at school, his life has
been one of toil. It Is unnecessary to giva
the long list of occupations; none ni them
trades, all heavy manual labor. We may
merely allude trÂ» hl3 expertencw in fol
lowing: a bay life, his long voyage on a
sealing schooner along the coast north to
the Russian side of Boring Sea. and his
numerous short voyages since.
There was an underworld in the United
States which Mr. London longed to ex
plore, and by the time he was IS he had
become possessed of an interest in sociol
ogy and economics. Swayed partly by this
and partly by the fascination of the en
terprise, he stepped down and out of the
world, and was swallowed up in that
strange region known as "the road." He
took this step thoroughly, living exactly
aa other tramps lived, and the long_
months he spent on the road bred In him
a lifelong interest In the institutions of
men from both an economic and an ethical
standpoint. ,
After this tramping expedition Mr. Lon
don returned to Oakland and applied
himself to study. He had previously
graduated from the grammar school and
had read omnlvorously. He now attended
the High School for a year, stayed at
home. and. without coaching, crammed
the next two years into three months,
took the entrance examinations and en
tered the â¢ University of California at
Berkeley. He was forced, much against
his will, to give this up just prior to the
completion of his freshman year.
More work followed and then Mr. Lon
don went to the Klondike in the fall rush
of 1807. He had a great variety of ex
periences there, but upon the death of hl3
father he returned home. He married,
recently, a Miss Maddern, who lived on
the Pacific Coast, and he and his wlfa
now make their home in Oakland. Cal.
As to Air. London's literary work, his
first magazine article was published In
January. 1899. In the Overland Monthly,
and is now the sixth story in the "Son of
the Wolf." Since then he has done work,
for a large number of the best magazines
and papers, besides a host of lesser publi
cations, newspapers and syndicates.
His early reading bred in him the deslr*
to write, his varied experiences have
given him the material and he Is still
studying, so that many critics regard him
as sure to make a prominent name for
himself in the world of literature.

begins with what may be called his ac
cidental murder of a member of the pow
erful secret society, the Camorra, with
whose chief Masslter comes into, close
personal relations. There is a distinct
love story running through the plot, and
one romantic event follows another with
little intermission, the action being
wrought out by forces characteristic of
the closing nineteenth century. The
mise en scene Is alrrost wholly Italian
landscapes or places with, which the au
thor, who has lived long in Rome, Is well

scenes Is a political uprising in the. Roman

That America . derives Its name rrom
Amerigo Vespucci has long been regard
ed as a certainty. Now, however, a his
torian comes forward and assures us that
this is not the case. This historian is Rl
cardo Falma, director of the National Li
brary cf Lima. Peru. In a book which
has just been published he Insists that
America was not named after Amcriso
Vespucci, but that, on the contrary,
Amerigo Vespucci was named after
Senor Palma, who has studied the sub
ijp^X for years, maintains that Vespucci's
first name was Alberico. "The name
'America,' he says, "is derived from a
place In Nicaragua, being the name of a
hill in the province of Chanvoles. Fur
thermore, the penultimate syllable "ic* Is
very often found in the words used by
the Indians of South America and by the
natives of the Antilles.. The syllable It
self signifies something largo and lofty,
and is found In the names of non-volcanic
mountains."
; He further points out that Columbus
did not use the word "America" in his let
ters when he referred to the events of bte
first voyage. "It is more than probable,"
he continues.* "that he learned through
one of his attendants of the discovery of
gold by some -natives in a place called

The medical department is doing every

for FurP'ies. and we g^* them and send
them wherever they are wanted.
espaHERE can be no war without casu
ll alties; that is to be expected, of
course, and the most careful prepa
/ rations are being made to relieve the
sufferings of the American soldiers in the
war with China.. The first hospital ship
that has been ordered there probably ar
rived about Ju'.y Â». It Is the Relief, the
best hospital ship afloat, in command of
Surgeon Major Perley. with a full corps
cf doctors and nurses and well equipped
with .every facility for taking care of the
sick and wounded. She started from
Manila and had accommodations for 250
flck ar.d wounded. The chief surgeon at
Manila has a!sa sent medical supplies for
5000 men for three months. In addition to
this each command that goes through San
Francisco will take its field supplies with
It.
In fitting a regiment out with supplies
the climatic conditions of the country to
which it if going are always carefully
considered. The men who go to fight in
China will be provided with blankets of a
heavier weight than those usually fur
nished, because of the severe winters In
Northern China. Fourteen hundred Sib
ley stoves have been provided for the sol
<?5ers by the quartermaster's department,
also F500 overcoats, 6000 pairs of Arctic
svershees. Â£000 blanket-lined canvas
hoods, a? well as other heavy winter
rlothlr.g in liberal quantity for 5XK) men.
We have a special hospital, which has
only been In operation a short time, at
Fort Bayard, N. M. It is a hospital for
consumptives. I made a trip a year ago
to find a proper location for such a hos
pital and selected Fort Bayard, where we
have had a military post for many years,
but which was no longer required as a
military station. The post was turned
over to me as a general hospital for cases
of tuberculosis. All of our soldiers brought
back with Incipient consumption are sent
to this hospital, where the climatic con
ditions are extremely favorable. It Is 5000

was due to the carelessness of soldiers In

would not take the trouble to sterilize it.
We have sent to China a lot of appliances
for Eternizing the water by boiling or fil

five gallons per hour. The Meade. now be

THE ORDER OF ALASKAN MOOSE
Questions the candidates pressed onward
up the slippery slope.
Around and about them flickered the
torches and danced :he dead men. Gus
tried to count them, h^ remember?, but
t*iey were like the lambs in the field, one
of which wouldn't stand still long enough
to be counted. They were an industrious
crowd of cadavers. When a man slipped
and fell back they made for him on the
instant, and he was urged forward again.
At the first bench the initiates received
%r. "obligation." one at a time, by placing
tnelr hands upon a block of Ice.
The next climb was harder. Now and
somewhere down the slope. Ho went llks
a long toboggan. One after another the
men were forced to the peals and one afteÂ»
another slid to the bottom and landed m
the snow. Out of all the forty only four
returned to carry on the ascent.
Those below could be seen beginning thÂ»
ascent once more. The ghouls kept to the
upper party, and many were the taunts
flung down to those below. The higher
they went, the steeper the climS. "One
slips back two steps for every or.Â» ha

But somehow they made the- paradoxical

the feathers of the warrior noSded upon
their heads.
Long Jack scrambled and floundered
helplessly. A knee was on his chest and
it was not until many apologies had been
wrung from him that he stood once more
on his feet and was allowed to join the
party of candidates at the glacier's foot.
When he was with them once more ha
looked above for the moose. It was gone.
"Look where It leads you on." said the
dead warrior, and a bony finger pointed
far above to where a figure might be seen
toiling up the glacier's aide.
"Onwardl" shouted the warrior.
It appeared to be from out. of the earth
that there sprung more of the warriors,
and there was a sudden sound as of dogs
yelping, for the forty felt sharp prods
from behind. "Onward!" echoed the other
Indians, and without stopping to ask
then the moose would turn and look back
toward his followers as If to beckon them
on.
At the second bench they were told that
they might rest. "But not until you have
proved your right to rest by showing that
you are the true prospector, sure-footed
and level-headed," said the leading In
dian. "Go to that rocky point and re
turn," he commanded Swedey Enoch, In
dicating an icy peak that jutted to the
right.
"Ay tank Ay fall," remonstrated Enoch.
"Then must you toll upward a^ain.**"' â¢
It was at the point of several prods that
Enoch was urged out to the point. **At

tor.
Jt was decided that the only fair way
v.ould be to Initiate the forty at once.
Flr.ce they had all Figned at the tame
t!mr. So there came a night in January
when forty rnincrs met at the bottom of
the glacier.
It w:is a black and white night, with the
snow â¢ and the sky cominp together In a
CBTVlas; line. There was just enough light

the tune. In the midst of the revelry came
a startled halt, for a tremendous voice
from somewhere thundered "Silence!"
Everybody looked toward it. On the Ice

The body was animal-like and nondescript.
co\*ered with brown fur; but the head
was plainly that of a moose, with horns
that branched ar.d bristled and fiery eyes
that cast a circle of light far around.
The men's silence -was complete and the
moose continued to speak.
Rosenthal ar.d the other followers of
the moose hxM a meeting after the dance
was over. They ca'.led together the min
ers presentâ all but the nire who had
taken the Ir.^.i'-f homf â and th*>y explain
ed f them the object and v/orkir.gs of the
lodge. Hosry talked until he had to mop
his forehead, for his enthusiasm waxed
prcat. and Uoctor Pearson then took the
matter in his own hands and invited the
miners to step up and sign as candidates.
"Think of â¢ your widows and orphans,
gentlemen." thumped the doctor.
"Think of the times we'll have at social
Catherines." shrilled Rosey.
The ball was the most splendid that
Valdez had ever seen. One extra lady

making nine, counting the squaw.

"Followers, ye are brave and true." pro

The remark of the neophyte was over
looked partly because he had proved him
self sterling material nnd partly because
the charter members were growing hun
gry themselves.
But reaching the top was not all, as tha
candidates soon found. It looked cozy* to
see the ghouls building a fire and gather-
Ing around It. They rubbed their ghostly
hands above the flames that lit up bony
faces. The four candidates huddled close
to the blaze and chatted comfortably oZ
their climb, when suddenly â
The light appeared to go out. Blindness
came upon them at once, for a bandaga
was quickly bound about each man's eyes,,
his hands and feet tied, and he felt him
*elf lifted high. They waited breathlessly,
txpecttng to come down In a snow drift,
but insteadâ
"Roast man is pood." they heard a deep
voice mutter. "Be he Swede or be ho
English, roast man la good."
"Stewed man is better," put In another
voice.
"Stewed men are better yet."
"The pot, the pot! Clap them In, cover
them tight, season to taste and they'll ba
ail right," chanted a weird chorus.
Of a sudden the men were hoisted Into
four several things that felt as the lnsida
of kettles might feel. With a clank covers
were clapped upon them and the pots be
gan to swing. The crackling of flames
was heard beneath, the heat Increased.
"A fine stew for the hungry moose,"
gloated a voice.
"What's left will do for hash." added
another.
"Who ever heard of stewlns anything
without water? They will burn." inter
rupted a third.
The lids were lifted and the victims felt
a douse of warm water. "Take me out,"
squealed poor old man Coleman. when his
kettle was open. "Toike me out. Oi say.
Oi won't be stewed for no moose. Oi say.
and begorry that's the truth Olm tellin'
ye."
Poor Coleman. ire hat) climbed the gla
cier at the head of the party, had
climbed in dead earnest and without a
laugh or a complaint. The climate and
the anxiety of a hard luck life had worn
on him so that of late days he had won
dered to himself what was the matter
with his old bones ar.d what made that
queer catch in his side. After the lodgs
was proposed to him he had gone home
talking to himself all the way about
something or somebody that would look
after "the kids and Hannah." in case
they didn't have him much longer. HÂ»
had taken the lodge so seriously, he had,
followed where the moose led so ialth
fully. and now:
"Take me out." he wailed. "Oi won't
be made hash of for no moose's break
fast."
It wa* lorg past midnight when all the
candidates had reached the glacier's sum
mit, had been "stewed" until they wera
deemed "done" and then laid on some
thing that they heard spoken of as' a plat
ter, ready for serving. There followed a.
long rttnal and the giving of passwords
and grips, then a quick descent was made
anil supper served In the town of Vaidez.
The menu was a masterpiece by Mr.
Rosenthal. Vaidezian oysters headed Itâ
the oysters being the Inevitable beans of
the Alaskan mir.er, served with a mustard
sauce. Mock moose soup was made of
Ions treasured bouillon capsules brought
from San Francisco, and Rosey salad with
mayonnaise was built upon an onion ba
o!s. which means high living where onions
sell for one dollar apiece. Roast moose
with green peas and potatoes a la Rosey
were genuine, and the peach mousse was
a> marvel, served with assorted cakes
which had been bought for crackers at
the store. Imported glacier -water, black,
coffee and cigars topped off the feast, and
forty new members of the Order of Alas
kan Moose went home in time for break
fast.
Since that January night twenty new
names have been added and the lodge
bids fair to spread through Alaska. Somo
of the members have gone on to Circlo
City, taking a charter with them to start
a new lodge, and from*there it is expected
to reach on to Daw?on. Details have been
carried out elaborately, even to the draw
ing of a coat of arms â ash'eld iÂ» the cen
ter and below a crossed pick and shovel
and a gold scale. Two Alaskan scenes
are on the shield and a moose bead loom*
above all.
And old man Coleman is proud of the
coat of arms and he has almost forgotten
that he once pleaded to be taken out of
17tank up to their shoulders, while their
feet lost themselves in the ooze of the drip
water. Others sat down or squatted at
the different stacks of vegetables and be
gan binding them with dried grasses into
bundles. Over in the corner, by a great
heap of young onions, a youthful Italian
squatted and worked, grabbing the onions
togethor in bunches of six and dextrously
tied them together, later binding the
bunches of six into larger bundles, and
tossing them, completed, to the men at
the tank-s. The same functions were be
ing performed with a stack of beets, a
heap of carrots and a mountain of celery,
while a whole wagonload of turnips, nil
headed the sane way, were being. attended
to by three men.
When the work was well under way
Baptiste went Into the cabin adjoining,
returning with a demijohnâ a very large
demijohnâ and it was full to the top of
ruby red juice of the grape. The Jug
went all around and' landed In the middle
of the shed, where it was left convenient
for the quenching cf frequent thirst.
Baptiste also brought out a tin pitcher
full of some red beverage, with two cups,
for his company, and with it a loaf of
bread some eighteen inches in diameter,
and very sour iind dark-looking indeed.
We were invited to partake.
I'Longa time befora da sup," said our
host. "Ton, leven da clock. " > "'
We would wait. The cook was already
at work in the kitchen, which was on the
other side of the wall, and a peppery
whiff now and then floated through the
cracks between the boards. Leaving the
men and my companion at work with the
vegetables I went into the kitchen to as
sist with the cookinp. The cook was a
duM-eyccl. low-browed, but quick-handed
fellow, with a chronic smile.
"What you cook?" 1 Inquired. "Cab

"No. s:â no cabbaga "
"Turnips, oi Ions?"
"Aw. no. si. no turnip, no onione."
"You have potatoes, celery, some veg

"Si. aw, no potate, no celere, no vegcta

"What will we have for supper?"
"Stow."
Stew, then, was the bill of fare. It was
being made In a pot! The cook chopped
a big p'.cee of b^ef into small chunks with
a hatchet and dropped them into the big
oval pot, which was sputtering with hot
lard. Then he brought out anoth<jr big
dcrr.ijohn and poured the contents over
the meat. It was sour claret, and there
was a merry frying and sizzling under
the tin lid. Next Perritaâ that was his
nameâ began peeling potatoes for the

acres of unromamic verdant thingsâcab

Outside the men were workingâ working

beads of perspiration rolled from their
facesâ¢ and my escort was sitting on an
upturned soap box entirely prostrated.

smaller and smaller and the wagons wer*

the tin lid he dumped them all into the
pot. following up with salt, pepper and
more sour claret. Then supper was all
made, except for the cooking of the stew.
Perrita put on a large teapotful^of water
to boil, and when it tipped to one side on
the broken lid of the stove he took a
twisted wire from a nail, secured the loop
in one end to the bail of the teapot and
anchored it to a nail on the v.-all. After
that there was no more trouble with the

light that crept through the smoky, dirty
glass of a broken lantern he* scraped and
gouged away industriously, the long par
ings dropping with dull and regular thuds
upon the floor. A great basketful he
peeled, and when they were all cut into
awkward chunks and put into a large tin
dish pan he waddled with them across the
floor and set them under the pouring
faucet.

the silence, but the time for temporary
release had come and there began a gen
eral babble of Italian gibberish, which
continued until a shrill whistle from the
kitchen announced the completion of the
stew. Then they flled In and took their
places along the sides of the big pine
plank that served as a table, a long bench
on either side of it.
The stew was thereâ three large tin pans
of it, and a crockery platter filled with
it for ourselves. There were forks for
all and a knife apiece for us. They ate
red wine. Across the table there was a
big-eyed, wondering fellow of some twen
ty years, who stared in amazement.' To
catch his eye meant to see them open even
wider and stare more wonderingly. We
were to him very strange creatures, in
deedâafter the strangeness of an escaped
wild creature of another clime.
Presently the stew was all gone and tha
last of the claret going. The men's head3
were drooping heavily upon their coarse,
loose shirt bosoms, and their feet, with

with rolypoly. cabbages, bursting sacks of
turnips and a miscellany of other green

Mr*: Eilis Rowan or .Melhourr.e..Austra
lia, who Is at present tn New York and
who has traveled more extensively in the
cannlbai coruhtry than any other Euro
pean woman, has told recently of the
istence In Australia of arrest tree which
is perhaps one of the most wonderful
plants of nature. It willhoid In its center
and devour the body of a man aa readily
as our Insectivorous wild fuwers trap ths
insects on which they partly subsist. Th9
tree is called the cannibal tree
Ab Mrs. Rowan describes it. ita appear
ance may be Imagined to resemble a mam
moth pineapple, which often reaches to
the height of eleven feet. Its foliage is
composed of a series of broad. board-Ilka
leaves, growing in a fringe at Its apex.
Instead, however of standing erect, as
does the little green tuft at the top of a
pineapple, these leaves droop over and
harp to the ground. In the largest speci
mens they ars often from fifteen to twen
ty feet lorg. and strong enough to bear
the weight of a man. Hidden under these
curious leaves Is to bp found a peculiar
growth of spearllke formation, arranged
In a circle, and which performs the samÂ«
function for the plant a3 do pistils fop
flowers. They can not. however, abide to
be touched.
Among the natives of Australia there In
a. tradition that in the old days of tha
antipodean wilds this tree was worshiped
under the name of the "Devil's tree." Its
wrath was thought to be greatly dreadad.
As seen as Its huge green leaves b^sran to
rise restless up and down Its worshipers
Interpreted the sign as meaning that a
Facrlfice must be made to appease its
anger. Cno among their numlf-r was
th/refose chosen, stripped of his raiment
ftr.d driven by shouting croT-cls u-p one of
Its leaves to the spex. ' All went well
with the 'victim until the instant that h<Â»
stepped into the center of the plants and
on the so-called pistils, when the board
like le>vf> would fly together and clutch
and squeeze out the life cf the Intruder.
By early travelers in Australia it !s af
firmed that the tree would then hold Us
prey until every particle cf his C.csh lad
fallen from his bones, after which the
leaves would relax their ho!d and the
gaunt skeleton 'fall heedlessly to the
ground.. In this way did its worshipers
seek to avert disaster and to still thÂ»
demon spirit among them.
The tree's present name and its un
canny actions remind us that the cannl-
bals of Northern Australia have also a
playful way of scattering about the bone*
at a victim after one cX their feast*

some one on the Canadian side and just
then he received his first good ducking.
The crest of a wave struck him full in
The head and face, and from that time on
until he floated out iri*to the whirlpool it
was knock after knock, as he met wave
after wave, all of them, that is' the
fcamy. air-charged portion, sweeping
well across his boat, dashln.i upon him
with a force almost sufficient to break his
neck. But the boat kept right side up all
the way. through the rapids. Never once
did it capsize. The lC30-pound iron sus
. pended to the keel served its purpose well
in this part of the river."
After Xi."5i=<\n reached the whirlpool he
kept very <iuiet m his boat, and some be-
Hevcd him unconscious when looking from
a distance. But soon he was seen to stand
up and exercise himself. Then the spec
tators realized that the cold day and
water were felt by him and they knew the
exposure .was severe. Nissen's experience
in the Niagara whirlpool has never been
equaled. It was simply wonderful. Those
who saw it were fortunate, so far as wit
nessing a stiang<\ interesting, thrilling
spectacle is/ concerned. The high winds
that had prevailed for two days had
served to raise the. height of the water in
j the river several feet. So far as the safe
ty of the tiip through the rapids was con
cerned, this was much in Nissen's favor,
but whild this was true, it also added an
extraordinary and unusual element of
danger to the 'whirlpool end of the voy
age, fcr the high water had brought a
vast amount of driftwood and ether de
bris dowrt the river, and all of i? seem
ingly had lodged. in the pool. When Nis
ser. swppt around the pool the first time
he ran f-.;lt into the midst of all this mat
ter near the inlet of the pool. His boat
was carried right into It, and he knew
there was another element of danger hov
ering- over him. A large piece of a crib
or bridge hung dangerotrsly near him.
while a log danced about his boat, now
and then being" shot in the air by the
action of the water in a: manner that was
highly excltingj and equally dangerous.
Several times It looked as- though this
log would fall upon and crush the boat,
but each time it swung off and NIssen
Â¦ vas saved. 'More than once the boat was
5 caught in. the suction of one of the num
erous whirlpools and raised on end, swlng
" Ing round and round. Four times Nissen
.was carried around the river pocket, and
' each ' time, when comparatively quiet
Â¦ water allowed, he took exercise to keep
. warm. He had passed under the. steel
arch bridge at 5 o'clock and two minutes
later was in the whirlpool, where he re
' mained i until nearly 6 o'clock before his
' fine was caught by the young men who
â¢'swam out to the boat. When he landed
he was chilled through, but there were
no bad effects from the trip or the expo-
sure. On the afternoon of July 13 Nis^en's
boat was towed around the whirlpool to
Thompsons Point by your? men he had
engaged to deliver it in the navigable
portion of the river. It was set adrift ani
went around Thompsons Point in good
shape, but lodged in tne eddy below on
the Canadian side. For five hours the
men worked to get it into the down cur

ton. In the morning it was found dash
ing against the rocks in the Devils Hole
eddy on the New York shore. It was on
Its side. The keel was pone, a fact thai
told too plainly that while this keel wa*
a safeguard for rapids voyaging, it would
have proved the death of Xissen ha-i ha
been swept out of the pool that Monday
afternoon, providing the boat took tho
same course It had during the night. ThÂ»
boat was bruised and the air compart
ments were partly full of water. The keel
was lost at some, shallow poir.t and is not
likely to be roeoversd. When Nissen
reached the boat "Wednesday morning it
wan hard on the rocks and the wrecking
party were at work. "I am sorry for my
boat." said Nissen. and his voice seemed
choked as hÂ« remarked. "Supposing I hail
been in it?" and the others thought the
same thing.
Â¦Aftrr some little effort the- beat was
once moro afloat and went with the cur
rent on down the river. An enterprising
resident of Quecnston. Ont.. hurried out in
a boat to capture It and towed it into the
Queenstown shore, -where Nissen was
forced to pay the man ?4 in addition to
what he had promised the wreckers before
the man would let him have the boat.
NIssen did not sec the justice of this", but
he pafd it rather than have a quawel.
Captain Hugh J. Mclntyre took the boa*
in tow of his fine steam yacht ami
brought It over to Cornell's dock at Lew
lston, from which point It was shipped to
Chicago.
Nlssen's personality is quite different
from that of many rapids navigntor3 of
the past, and all who meet him are puz
zled to know- why a man of his apparent
pood judgment wanted to shoct the rap
ids. But then it was a Chicago idea that
a boat line to the -whirlpool from the falls
would be a prcfÂ»inb!e feature at Niagara.
Having developed this idea, he went on
and demonstrated to his own satisfaction
that the Jash of the rapidd waa a littles
too lively ?ven for Chicago poop!?.

COST OF WAR
WITH CHINA
CAUJ BUREAU, WELLINGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, July 28. â War against
China, which yesterday was believed to be only a possible outcome of the present condi
tions, is fast coming' to be regarded as almost inevitable.
When Secretary Hay's note was addressed to the powers it was on the theory that the in
ternational forces w<:re to aid the Chinese Government in bringing about the conditions set forth
as those which this Government would co-operate to secure. The conviction is being forced upon
the administration, however, that the Chinese Government, if not originally responsible for the
anti-foreign outbreak, has ceased to oppose it, and that the safety of foreigners in the empire now
and hereafter can be secured only by guarantees obtained frpm the imperial authorities at the
point of the sword. *
Evidences are multiplying tending to show that it is the Chinese Government rather than
the insurgents that is responsible for the treatment to which the Ministers have been subjected in
Peking, and that imperial troops rather than Boxers will resist the advance of the /international
forces. Whether the Ministers are alive or dead, the treatment they have received in Peking, if
responsibility for it can be traced to "the imperial Government, would be sufficient justification for
declarations of war by the powers.
DECLARES NO LEGATIONS
WERE STANDING ON JULY 7
Special Dispatch to the CalL
WHILE in so far as definite knowledge of the fate of the legations in Peking is con-/
cerned the world remains at a standstill, fears are increasing that the outcome of the
general situation must inevitably be war. Even in Washington, where the most
hopeful view might be expected to prevail, there is a growing conviction that the Chinese
Government, even if not responsible for the anti-foreign movement, has ceased to oppose it
and that' the time is rapidly approaching when its policy of evasion and procrastination will
be thrown aside for an open defiance of Western civilization.
Various dispatches arriving from Chinese sources were made public in Europe and
America yesterday. AH repeat the statement of the safety of the legations and fail to con
vince. Similarly a report ascribed to a Russian banker, of the probable massacre of for
eigners in Peking was considered to lack authority.
As for the cipher telegram signed "Conger," which purported to have been sent from
Peking by the United States Minister on July 18, Secretary Hay to-day informed Minister Wu
that in his opinion it was a forgery. The contents of the message, it is learned, were known
before it reached the State Department to both Yuan Shai Kai of Shantung and Taotai
Sheng, a director of Chinese telegraphs, both of whom have been objects of peculiar suspi
cion from the outset of the troubles, and the only inference is that they were acquainted
with the State Department cipher.
A parliamentary bluebook issued In London to-day contained documents showing
that an adroit appeal was made at the beginning of the month to Great Britain-by the Chi
nese Government to secure her support against the other powers.
According to advices which reached Washington yesterday, but which require confir
mation, an imperial edict had been received by Li Hung Chang bidding him to hasten to the
capital to take command of the imperial forces in Chili province and lead them against for
eigners. According to this report, foreign envoys were to be kept in durance as hostages.

BRIEF RESUME OF THE DAY'S
FAR EASTERN DEVELOPMENTS
TIENTSIN, July 24 (via Chefu and Shanghai July 28). â A Chinese student, who has been under the supervision of Missionary Wilder and who
started for Peking two weeks ago, returned here late this afternoon. He reports that Chinese imperial troops completely surround the Tar
tar city. He was unable to deliver the messages with which he had been entrusted to the legations. He begged the Chinese to let him go
through, but was told it was impossible â that they could not pass any representative of foreigners.
On the afternoon of July 14, according to the messenger, the Chinese ceased the attack on the legations, and during the remainder of his
stay everything was quiet. On July 18 an imperial edict was issued commanding all persons to protect foreigners. The messenger left Peking on
that day. He saw no troops for sixty miles south of Peking, but in the vicinity of Yangtsun and Pietsung there were . about 20;000,

VALLEJO. July 28.â Colonel William S. Muse, commanding the Marine
Corps at Mare Island Barracks, has received telegraphic orders to
proceed to China on August 15 to relieve Colonel R. I* Meade. who
commands the marines in China at the present time. Colonel Meade
entered the Marine Corps on March 18, 1S54. and hus proved himself an
able officer ar.d one of rare executive ability. He was stationed on this coast
some years ago, and was again place-3 in command of marines here upon the
death of Colonel Williams, some months ago.
When Colonel Muse reaches China he will hold a very Important position
and one that will require an ab!e officer, he being next In command to the
commandant of the station, and the euthorities would not put any but the
most reliable and trustworthy officers In such a position. Colonel Muse was
appointed from Maryland.
NEW YORK, July 2S.â The Sun has the
following from Rome: Count San Mar
tino, the Italian aiinlster of War, who was
formerly Italian Minister to China, takes
a gloomy view of the Chinese situation
In general and of affairs in Peking in par
ticular. He has not the slightest doubt
that the advance of the allied forces on
tho capital will be the signal for a general
Insurrection, in which the Yangtse Vice
roys will have to join.
( Count Martlno says he has received
from China fullest proof of a plot or
ganized by the mild young Emperor, who
is tired of his condition of tutelage. It
was arranged that he should leave the
palace at night, take refuge in the Britjsh
legation and there hoist the Imperial flag
and proclaim the deposition of the Em
pres.s Dowaser on the ground of senile
decay. â¢
This whole business was to have been j
managed by the Military Governor of
Tientsin, who was to march upon the capi
tal. But at the last moment the Gov
ernor turned traitor and the Empress
Dowager, believing that all the legations
were concerned In the scheme, commenced
retaliating by patronizing the Boxers,
with the disastrous results now known.

"If you meet the enemy and you defeat

the Huns under their King Etzel made

WORDS OF KAISER IN
BREWERHAVEN SPEECH
The Pope has issued through the Car
dinal Vicar of Catholic Missions a letter
which directs that general prayers shall
bo offered up in Catholic churches
throughout the world for the safety of
Christians in China. The letter also ex
presses the hope that instead of motives
of revenge the Almighty shall Inspire
everybody with thought of concord and
peace, which will prevent further ruin
and massacre.

* on the speech of Emperor Willifim,
in which he told the soldiers on the way
to China to give no quarter and to take
no prisoners, states it is the earnest wish
of the Pope and Cardinal Rampolla, the
Papal Secretary of State, that the powers
shall not resort to nor permit a policy of
retaliation and revenge.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, July 2S.-AFSurances
that the Peking Ministers are
a!lve came to-day from Mr. Fow
ler, the American Consul at Che
fu; frcm Mr. Me Wade, the American Con
sul at Canton, and from Minister "\Vu,
the Chinese Minister here. The latter
came to the State Department early ex
pressly to deliver an edict received by him
to Secretary Hay. It is similar in form
to the edict published yesterday in Lon
don. The Minister says that the only
differences are those in% - olved in separate
translations.
Mr. Wu's translation of Sheng's dis
patch is as follows:
"Edict of the 2Sth of the sixth moon
(corresponding to July 24) states that fort
unately all ministers, except Baron von
Ketteler, are alive and unharmed. They
aro now being supplied with vegetables,
fruit and provisions by the Government
to show Its sympathy for them."
If Mr. Wu had any dsubt as to the safe
ty of the Ministers, It seems to have been
dlFsipated by this edict. He labored ear
nestly with Secretary Hay to convince
him that he was bound to accept this offi
cial declaration of the Chinese Govern
ment. He pointed out that this last
declaration differed materially from most
of the other statements that have ema
nated from Chinese sources in the im
portant fact that it did not represent
merely the belief of a minor official or a
viceroy; it was the solemn declaration
of the Chinese Government. In making
the statement touching the Ministers, the
Chim-se Government, therefore, assumed
a ftri-jus responsibility to the world at
large. He declared that It could not be
conceived that such responsibilities would
be lightly assumed, and therefore he (Mr.
Wu) did not hehitate to assert his positive
personal conviction that the Ministers
were alive on July 24.
When his attention was called to the
apparent failure of Yuan Shal Kal to ac
cede to Consul Fowler's request that the
allied admirals he- put into communication
with the Ministers. Mr. Wu shrugged bis
shoulders in a deprecatory manner, and
merely replied that the Chinese were so
different from other people that the
usuil tests could not be applied to them;
It would not l>* possible to predict what
they would Oo under conditions that
Â¦would be easily met by Europeans or
Americans. It was possible, he added,
that Yuan was really undertaking to do
what the admirals wished, only it would
first be npccfisiry for him to consult the
Pekinp authorities, and that would tp.ke
time. He could not say when an answer
might he ejijteulfd to his last message to

is as follows:

WASHINGTON, July 23.â The Secretary
of State has received the following dis
patch from Mr. Fowler, the American
Consul at Chefu, dated at midnight on
the 26th:
IMPERIAL EDICT
FORWARDED BY YUAN
at the State Department, which is being
speculated upon. These assurances have
r.een given In answer to the repeated and
urgent demand of the various European
Governments when they be placed
in communication with the Ministers, and
the last assurance of Yuan was In answer
to the specific demand of the foreign ad
rr.irals for direct communication. Yuan's
announcement that the imperial Govern
ment at Peking not only asserts the
Fafety of the Ministers, but declared that
they have been provisioned, if accepted
us true, indicates that the Ministers have
been communicated with. The inquiry
then naturally arises:
If the Ministers have been provis
ioned, why dors not the Chinese Govern
ment, knowing as It docs that the whole
Â¦world is demanding a direct message from
the besieged lepationers. allow them to
communicate with their Governments?
\\ hy not furnish direct and unequivocal
evidence of the safety of the Ministers in
stead of this repetition of an assurance
which the world hesiuitea to accept?
The failure to purpJe the direct method
which must be available tends almost ir
resistibly to the suspicion that something
has happened in Peking which the Chi
nese Government desires to conceal from
the powers; that it is afraid to allow the
true Ftory to be revealed until terms have
been made with the powers which are
waiting at the gate's of the empire. Just
what that something is furnishes a fruit
ful theme for speculation, but no satis
factory conclusion can be reached until
the forces enter Peking or the legatloners
arrive at Tientsin.

The correspondence' shows that Count
Muravieft. the late Russian Minister of
Foreign Affairs, took an optimistic view
of the situation in China, but that Count
Lamsdorff, hia successor, was far from
sharing in this sanguine view. He thought
that Northern China was In a state of
hopeless anarchy, as did M. Delcasse, tho
French Minister of Foreign Affairs, who
on July 5 considered the Imminent danger
"Since the opening of commercial inter
course between the foreign nations and
China the aspirations of . Great Britain
have always been after commercial ex
tension, not territorial . aggrandizement.
Recently dissensions have arisen between
Christians and. the people <if Chill and
Shantung. Certain evil disposed persons
have availed themselves of the occasion
to make disturbances, and these have ex
tended so rapidly that the treaty powers,
suspecting the rioters might have been
encouraged by the Imperial Government,
attacked and occupied the Taku forts. The
sufferings arising from this act of hostil
ity have been great and the situation is
much involved. In consideration of the
facts that of the foreign commerce of.
China more than 70 per cent belongs to
England, that the Chinese tariff is lower
than that of any other country and the
restrictions thereon fewer, British mer
chants have during the last few decades
maintained relations with Chinese mer
chants at ports as harmoniously as if
both were .members of the same family.
But now complications have arisen, mu
tual distrust has, been engendered and the
situation has thus changed for the worse,
and it Is felt that If China cannot be sup
ported in maintaining her position foreign
nations, looking on so large and populous
a country, so rich In natural resources,
might be tempted to exploit or despoil it
ana perhaps differ among themselves with
respect to their conflicting interests. It
is evident that this will create a state of
mr-tters that would be disadvantageous,
to Great Britain, a country which views
commerce as her greatest interest. China
is now engaged in raising men and means
to cope with these eventualities, but she
feels that if left to herself she might not
be equal to the occasion should it ever
arise, and therefore turns to England in
the hope of procuring her good offices In
bringing about a settlement of the dif
ferences that have arisen with the other
treaty powers.
"The Emperor makes this frank ex
posure of what is nearest his heart and
hopes this appeal to her Majesty the
Queen Empress may be graciously taken
under consideration and an answer vouch
safed at the earliest possible moment."
The papers elope with the edict of June
29 already published, which was commu
nicated to the Foreign Office July 13.
The Parliament paper on China shows
that considerable negotiations had previ
ously passed between Great Britain and
the other European powers regarding the
policy of Japan's action, while I^ord Sal
isbury notified Embassador Pauncefote on
June 22 as follows: â¢
"You suggest to Secretary of State Hay
that any troops which it is possible to
send from Manila would be of great value,
i as it is probable that the United States
legation is In great danger, as well as
the legations of other powers."
Germany assumed the position regard
ing the Japanese matter that nothing
must be done to imperil the accord of the
powers. Japan insisted upon an assurance
that her invasion would not lead to a col
lision with Russia. Russia finally declared
on June 2S that she had no desire to hin
der Japan's liberty, especially after her

January 4 to July 13, when the Chi

Lo Feng L.uh, communicated to Lord
Salisbury the imperial edict. The last
written communication from the British
Minister at Peking, Sir Claude Macdonald,
dated May 2S, refers,, to the warning, to
Prince" Ching that the Ministers would
summon guards unless the Government
showed a greater disposition to protect
the legations. Minister Macdonald admk
ted that he was somewhat surprised at
the calmness with which Prince Ching re
ceived the suggestion, which he said had
already been made to him. Minister Mac
donald adds:
"Possibly the Government has awak
ened to the strength of the Boxer move
ment and would be disposed to welcome
the additional security afforded by the
presence of foreign troops."
The contents of Sir Claude Macdonald's
subsequent telegrams are already known.
On July 7 Lord Salisbury notified the
Viceroys through a communication to the
Chinese Minister that they would be held
personally guilty should any injury be
done to the Europeans. On July 6 Lord
Salisbury gave the southern Viceroys as
surances of support.
On July 11 the Chinese legation forward
ed to the Queen a telegram dispatched
from Peking July 3 by the Emperor, as
follows:
DENVER, Colo., July 2S.â J. C. Welp
ton of this city to-day received a letter
from his brother, H. G. Welpton, a physi
cian and missionary in China, which was
written on June 23 and in which he said
he would cable later to assure his friends
of his safety. As no cable from him has
been received his friends fear he has been
killed. The letter written by Dr. Welpton
was sent from Kullng. China, via Kiani
kiang. At that time, June 23, he was very
hopeful about the situation and the safety
of foreigners. He says thnt the native's
were, all kind to him and evidences of
trouble were scarcely to be found. Hf
wrote from tho interior of China, where
there is comparative peace and to which
place It is not believed the insurrection has
spread. Dr. Welpton wrote further that
most of the American? in the interior
were then hastening to Peking to be
under the protection of the legations in
case trouble should begin. He declared
that It would be a great mistake for the
powers to partition China: that the Ori
ental nation should be left Intact in order
that Christian missions might spread
throughout the empire.
The letter was written June 11, sent
by courier to Tientsin and mailed at that
place June 14. The missionaries, Mrs.
Woodward says, had fled to the American
legation. June 19. she declares, acting un
der the advice of Mr. Conger, she and her
daughter, accompanied by Secretary Bain
bridge and a guard of rour soldiers, left
the legation and started for the railway
depot. With much difficulty they reached
the station, only to llnd that the Boxers
had torn up the rails for several miles,
burned the bridges between Peking and
Tientsin and cut the telegraph wires.
Nothing remained but to return to the
legation. They were continually attack
ed by roving bands of riotous natives and
alter a desperate running fight they man
aged to regain the protection of the lega
tion. In the legation, Mrs. Woodward
says, it was reportf-d that a small army
of the allies had started to relieve the
prisoners. Provisions, she declared, were
plentiful. In concluding her letter Mrs.
Woodward says:
"V/e feel confident that we will be res
cued. In fact, we are assured that every
thing possible will be done by our Gov
ernment and other Christian nations to
relieve us immediately."
PROBABLY MURDERED

by missionaries fo escape from Peking
was received here to-day by Morgan S.

wife and daughter lone are visiting Min

"It will be almost impossible to move

PREVENTED ESCAPE OF
WOMEN FROM PEKING
"For many years the Chinese have been
contemplating the removal of the court
from Peking to this inland city, the idea
being uppermost In the Chinese mind that
the more inaccessible the capital the
fewer would be the demands upon China
from the outer world. Besides this citv
was a capital of China In ancient times.
It is situated on the so-called 'Marco Polo'
road, known to the Chinese as the great
north trade route.
"If the Ministers are being held as
hostages and are being removed to the
remote inland city of Singan-Fu, a place
most dirtjcult to reach. It is natural that
the Chinese should put forth ail their
finesse and cunning to conceal this move
until they are safely across the moun
tains.
"When the allied relief forces reach Pe
king 1 think they may find the capital de
serted by the court and the envoys gone.
It is not unlikely that the Empress, and
possibly the Emperor, have fled with their
court under the escort of Manchu Banner
men from Peking to Slngan-Fu, taking
with them the Ministers at least as host
ages and leaving the other foreigners in
Peking to a horrible fate.

EMPEROR KWANG SU'S
APPEAL TO VICTORIA
THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 29, 1900.
While the positive statement is made
that it is not the present intention to send
any more troopa from Manila to China, at
the came time it is known that all con
tingencies have been canvassed, and that
if an .emergency should arise in China
which made it imperative to have addi
tional troops they would be drawn from
the Philippines for temporary duty at
least. Some' time ago General MacArthur
was advised by Secretary Root to main
tain sufficient* transports to carry supplies
between Manila and Taku, and these
transports would be available for emerg
ency troops. The Pennsylvania, Indiana
and Sumner, when the latter arrives at
Manila, probably will be held for service
between Manila and Taku and -will be
available for the contingency which may
occur, but which the department does not
expect to arise. A stubborn resistance to
the advance of the International armies
might make additional troops necessary'.
In that event a speedy relief column no
doubt would be sent from Manila.
this evening, though it may be several
days before his report of the fact can
reach the department. The Irregular and
unsatisfactory character of the present
system of communication between Taku
and the cable office has been taken into
account by the War Department, and it
is said that one of Chaffee's llrst acts on
taking command of the United States
forces ashore at Taku and Tientsin will
be to establish, perhaps in co-operation
with other commanders, a line of rapid
boats, running from Tientsin to Shanghai
or Nagasaki.
WASHTXGTOX. July 2S.â The day
brought forth the usual - crop of
edicts and reports from various
quarters, and the usual visit from
Minister Wu to the State Department,
bearing directly upon the welfare of the
Ministers in Peking. This constantly
growing mass of assertion is beginning to
have a cumulative effect upon the skep
tics and there is a noticeably more hope
ful view taken of the state of affairs to
day. Beyond the fact that It Is scarcely
conceivable that the Chinese authorities
should persist in repeating and strength
ening these stories up to the rapidly ap
proaching moment when the whole truth
must be disclosed by other agencies, it
appeared upon careful consideration of
the reports that there really was a little
more ground for hope as to the safety of
Mr. Conger and his colleagues at Peking
to-day than there was yesterday. The de
pressing fact Is always in mind that the
Chinese authorities, by their own state
ments able to communicate Â¦with the lega
tioners, for some mysterious reason . do
not permit these unfortunates to com
municate with their own governments.
Minister TVu's explanation of this, .that
the Chinese methods are different from our
own, Is scarcely sufficient for the officials
here. The Minister, however, is honestly
trying to get a further communication
through from Mr. Conger, and it may be
that success in this undertaking will af
ford him a brilliant vindication.

Gentlemen â "As a tonic I find your
Piruna an excellent madic.'ne to build
up and resiora tho nervous system.
My work is out doors and traveling to
a great extent, and during inclement

preventative against colds, and as a
catarrhal treatment it is unexcelled,

varied phases of catarrh peculiar to sum-
mer. Sent free.
"Hoping that Peruna may do for
others what it has done forme, I rec-
ommend it to every one." I remain,
truly yours, Mrs. Fred Bohde.
Mrs. Fred Bohde, Goegfein, Ind.,
writes: "I was a sufferer from
headache and pains in my stomach
for ten years, more or less. I con-
sulted doctors, but they could give
me no relief. I grew Â»eaker right
along and didn't expect that I could
live very long. One day I happened
to get a '99 Peruna almanac. I saw
my case described in it and also a
sure cure, so I decided to give it a
trial. I commenced to take it last
spring, and after faking half a botth
of Psruna I felt like a new person. I
continued taking Peruna until fall,
following your directions carefully,
and I have to say that I feel better
than I ever did.
If there Is a remedy in the whole rango
of medicinal preparations that Is in every
particular adapted to this form of dyspep-
sia, that remedy is Peruna. It not only
acts as an appetizer, but It imparts to
the stomach the vigor to properly digest
the food by awakening the paristaltlc
movements of the digestive organs.
This is a very common form of dys-
pepsia among the mentally overworked
class, whose nervous systems become de-
pressed by Jpng continued strains and
sedentary habits.
A dose of Peruna before each meal dur-
ing the hot season is a safe&juar;l of price-
less value to those who are In the least
subject to nervous prostration, and an ef-
fectual protection against summer colds.
Mrs. M. Dooley. Mt. Airy. Habersham
county. Ga., writes: "in the spring of
the year l v ,tf) I took your Peruna for about
three weeks according to directions ami
also one bottle of Manalin. arnl can truly
say that I consider myself cured of
catarrh of the stomach of five years'
standing. / on/y ioQ^ ihrQQ ooWas
of Peruna and one of Manalin which
generally stimulated the liver, the
glands of the stomach and bowels,
and it is a most splendid ionic. p eru .
na is a wonderful medicine for catarrh of
the stomach. If I ever have any more
trouble I will most assuredly take Peruna.
It is the only medicine I ever took that
did me any good. Peruna acted like majrtc
in my case. I believe it ia the best medi-
cine on earth for dyspepsia. I also believe
there Is no other medicine on the market
that equals it for family use."
Atonic dyspepsia is simply nervous pros-
tration of the stomach. There is not usu-
ally much pain, but a feeling of great
weight, and sometimes faintnesa after
each meal, followed, by sour eructatior.a
and belching of gas. The bowels may be
regular and appetite good, but the weak-
ened stomach, which should be in con-
stant movement after a meal, lies dor-
mant, allowing the food to soon decom-
pose instead of digesting.
Every one who Is. In the least degree
subject to nervousness, sleeplessness,
prostration, mental fatigue or nervous
tlebility in any form, find* the hot weath-
er of July and August very hard to bear,
if not dangerous.

Annihilate the Negroes.
KEW ORLEAXS. July 28.â Mob violence
seems to have spent Itself and the city Is
quiet. No fresh outbreaks are reported,
the burning of the Thorny Lafon School
last night having evidently been the
crowning piece of mob violence.
Mayor Capdevllle says that lawlessness
such as that. which has shocked the com
munity In the last few days can only "be
suppressed with force. He said to-day
that he had no intention of disbanding
the police or discharging the militia, until
the last vestige of mob violence had dis
appeared. '

until. 5 o'clock Monday morning.
The other proclamation requested all
merchants to close their respective places
of business at 6 p. m. and keep them
closed until 6 a. m. Monday.
The order closing barrooms was en
forced, and the request on the merchants
was almost unanimously complied with.
The bodies of the two negroes who were
killed by mobs yesterday were buried
quietly from the morgue to-day. During
the early morning . hours to-morrow the
disfigured remains of the desperado
Charles will be taken from the morgue
and interred in the potter's field with as

yet far from pacified. Sergeant Porteus

corted to the graveyard by a full battalion
of police.

fore 9 o'clock crowds had collected out
side the church gates. By 10:15 o'clock
the crowds had swelled to enormous pro
portions. The late opening of the church
doors caused great inconvenience to early
guests, who were pushed here and there
and almost swept from their feet. When

The church was not overcrowded. It

the bride, were quite unoccupied, while
the Cornwallis-West family was not rep

The Duke of Marlborough, -who gave
the bride away, arrived in summerlike at

a crimson flower in his buttonhole. Direct

LONDON July 23.â This week of rumors, j
edicts and Chinese protestations by the
score ends with England as firmly con
vinced as ever that the foreign Ministers
at Peking have been massacred. Not on
ly that, but in the determined attempts on
the part of the Chinese authorities to con- ;
vince the world of the truth of their as
sertions, prominent organs of public opin
ion are unanimous in seeing a desperate ;
plot on the part of the Chinese Govern
ment to delay the day of retribution in the
hope that the powers will become em- !
broiled among themselves. The Chinese ;
declarations have, in fact, aggravated j
rather than ameliorated the feeling j
against the Eastern empire.
Archibald Ross Colquhoun, the distin- |
guished geographer and correspondent of j
the Times during the Franco-Chinese war
Of 1SS3-S4, in a review of the situation Â¦
trenchantly declares:
"What we want is not knowledge, how- j
ever profound of the Chinese. Rather
would we strengthen the hands of Ad- !
miral Seymour or some other commander, j
throw ourselves boldly into the breach .
and. If necessary, take some risks. No big
thing has even been done without a cer- 1
tain amount of risk."
Bernard Shaw comes out with a scath- |
ing protest against retaliations, such a? [
the suggested execution of Prince Tuan. j
the razing of Chinese cities. etc.. t
"which," Mr. Shaw says, "characterizes i
the most horrible, cowardly mobocracy i
that can be imagined. Revenge under
any extremities of provocation must be
absolutely barred."
Japan's New Vessels.
Abuses on Ellis Island-
Quietly but steadily Japan s three war
vessda building at Elswick are â¢ being â¢
pushed toward completion. The Idzumo. ,
a powerful armored cruiser, is nearly
ready and 600 Japanese sailors are aboarcfl
her, patiently waiting the word to sail.
The average opinion is that they will be
needed for a deadly conf'.ict. Kven the
unhysterlcal Spectator this week pessimis
tically incline* to the belief that the in
terests at stake in the Far East are too
varied and conflicting to enable the pow
ers to indefinitely preserve the thin ice
of harmony on which they are standing
at present.
With the shipment of men to the China
sea comes the need of money. European
nations must have more gold.
"It will become necessary." says the
Statist, "to raise the value of money in
London to a point where pold will be at
tracted Â¦ from the United States, and un
less the Bank of England affords facili
ties to import the rate will have to rise
to a comparatively high figure before gold
arrives. On the other hand, if the bank
is willing to give facilities, early imports
of gold from the United States may occur.
The arrival of two or three millions of
gold from New York would greatly facili
tate the issue of British and other Gov
ernment loans. That the United States
can spare a considerable amount of gold
is certain." . i: ; ~' +
A "ertous attack ha? been mace in the
columns of the Express against the treat
mentâ of immigrants arriving at New
York. That paper sent a representative
in the steerage of the steamer La Cham
pagne, who in thÂ» course of a series of ar
ticles entitled "The Closed Door" has been
giving English readers vivid pictures of
the horrors of a steerage passage. The
writer however, chiefly devote? himself
to the alleged brutality and corruption of
officials at the barge office and on Ellis
Island. The latter the writer describes
as a prison, where, he maintains, immi
grants are beaten asd abused worse than
; cattle.
The Ellis Island warders are called "the
dirtiest ruffians in New York." Medical
examination of Immigrants it is alleged
Is made without any regard to theory of
principles or hygiene. .... , r ,
The reporter says the Invincible?, Mul
let and Fitzharris, were a thousand times
better treated than other iininlsrrants. not
excluding feeble women ami children. He
elves numerous instances with names. An
idea of the attack can be pained from the
following: account of a supper on Ellis
Island: . . .
"We parsed in a long: *?ne around the
room. A man with filthy hards filled our
hats or handkerchiefs with moldy prunes.
Another thrust two lumps of bread in our
hands. Supervising " the distribution was
a foul-ir.outhe.d Bowery tou?h. who
danced upon the table and poured forth
uDon us torronts of ob?cene. hlasphemous
abuse. I saw him drac an old man. a
long-bearded Polish Jew past the barrel
of prunes by the hair on his face. I saw
him kick another emigrant, a German,
on the head with a heavy boot."
The Express writer believes that If the
shipping companies were compelled by
the Legislature to refund the deported
emigrapts the entire sum spent in the
Journey asrents would soon cease to em
bark people who obviously have no possi
ble chance of acceptance.

PARIS. July 2S.â Yu Kens, the Chinese
Minister here* says he is convinced the le
gations in Peking are saXe and sound, al
though some buildings have been de
stroyed. While this convict:on is not
shared by the offlciai and poliucal world
here, dispatches received from the Far
East during the pas: week have raised
renewed hope that sorae. if not all, of the
members of the legations are still alive.
Minister Yu Keng thinks the silence of
the Ministers at Peking not so ominous
as it is considered abroad, and he asks
that China be given another nve days'
credit to produce authentic and satisrac*
tory news, of the legations or perhaps of
the Ministers themselves. He himself is
still in ignorance of the actual situation
in Peking, but concludes from dispatches
be nas received from the provincial Vice
roys ana from teiegrams asking for the
mediation of France that Emperor Kwang
Su and the Empress Dowager have the
upptr hand and that Prince Tuan has
bevn definitely mastered
â¢â¢.Happily for my country and for the
foreigners"." he eaid. "Yung Lu and
Prince Chlng are, 1 believe, now in power.
ami this leaves me hopeful â even though
the presumption of the Ministers may
prove correctâ that the legationers axe
still alive."
The feeling obtains here that this may
not eolve- the situation, and though alive
the Ministers are still probably held as
hostas^s. The equivocal declarations ol
Li Hung Chang have served to deepen the
Ceding of mistrust regarding all Chinese
aftirma.tlon arid information.
The Associated Press learns that the
foreign Governments Intend to disregard
Li Hung Chang's rwumrnendatiensâ wnlch
they believe are made in bad faithâ not
to march on Peking. On the contrary,
the international expedition will start
about the middle of next week, following
as closely as possible tue railroad. Little
aouot is "felt mat the Chinese Government
wiil hold the surviving European Minis
ters as a lever to secure better terms in
the final settlement, but in this they will
be disappointed, for the powers will exact
for this violation of international law even
a higher indemnity than they would have
demanded if the Ministers had been al
lowed to leave Peking of their own voli
tion.
Japanese Interference.
Meanwhile, negotiations are actively
proceeding between the powers and the
situation which will succeed the entry of
the international troops into Peking will
be awaited with the greatest anxiety. Al
ready things do not appear to be going
altogether smoothly at Tientsin and jeal
ousies are beginning to pop out that may
develop into a very serious disagreement
before long. The relations between Japan
and China which may eventuate from the
present trouble are being discussed in the
diplomatic world. Although the Japan
ese Minister here scouts the idea of any al
liance between China and Japan, tha
possibility of such a development is taken
into consideration by the foreign repre
sentatives.
The Emhassador of one of the great
powers, ailuding to the jealousies which
have already become perceptible, said:
"The moment is a critical one for the
white races in the Far East. To win they
must stand together. Japan at the pres
ent moment Is apparently with the West
ern powers, but it must be remembered
that although Japan, as a result of the
Chino-Japanese war and by reason of her
acquired civilization, looks down upon the
Chinese, still their many race affinities
and other ties between the two nations,
with Japan's ambition, may lead to a
coalition of the two srroat members of the
yellow race which would be fraught with
peril to the western world. China, under
Japan'* tutelage, would become a great
power with whom the European nations
might have graver problems than the par
celing out of her territory among them,
which has chiefly occupied them up to
the present. As Indicating the Russian
suspicion of such an eventuality. It Is
known here that RuÂ«sia is mobilizing 200,-
O/j men at Odessa for any emergency."
Attacks on Loubet.
The conflict between the Paris Munici
pal Council end the Ministry of M. Wal
deek-Rousseau is becoming serious. Pres
ident Loubtt is now Involved, as he was
obliged to refuse an Invitation to attend
a series of fetes to be given at the Hotel
de Vllle because the Ministry was not in
vited also. The protocol decrees that M.
Loubet shall not participate officially un
less he is accompanied by the Cabinet.
The Nationalist Councilors and party or
pans are furious apainst M. Loubet, de
spite the fact that he is helpless in tho
matter. This deadlock between the Paris
Council, the Cabinet and the Elysee must
eventually lead to difficulties, and in view
of the uncompromising attitude of both
si<1es it Is not easy to foresee the end.
Paris is still situated In a torrid zone,
although heavy etorms which have oc
curred in the north freshened the air
slightly toward the end of the week. The
heat sÂ«Tit the death rate soaring, espe
cially among children. Many sunstrokes
occur daily, and the hospitals axe over
crowded with this class of patients,
thoujth 1200 cots were added to the various
hospitals. Horses suffered terribly, the
street car companies alone losing 12uO ani
mals. Owlnp to the shortage in the water
supply the house service in Paris is cut
off between 11 o'clock at nisrht and fl
o'clock in the morning, â¢while many resi
dents of upper stories are inconvenienced
by the intermittent service dvring the
day. which is Insufficient to meet the de
mands, and many restaurants even are
unable to obtain sufficient for their needs.
The hot weather has driven the American
colony to the seashore and mountains.
Nearly all the National Commissioners to
the exposition and their families have left
Paris tor a couple of months.
Mr. and Mrs. Potter Palmer are at St.

PHOENIX. Ariz., July 28.â There is to be a big manhunt in the wild re
glons of Graham County, and Sheriff Ben Clark Is leading the posses to the
round-up of the outlaws.
For years the Inaccessible portions of Graham County, notably along Eagle
Creek and Black River, the latter tho headwaters of Salt River, have been over
run by many gangs of lawless men. both Mexicans and whites. Chaceon, ac
cused of many murders and who broke Jail on the day preceding that appointed
for his execution at Solomon ville; the murderers of Olsen and Stewart and nu
merous other notorious desperadoes, are believed to be with the outlaw band.
About July 1 M. T. Wheeler and F. M. Howe left Morencia for an outing on
Eagle Creek. Failing to return, a searching party found their bodies, both shot
through the head. The searching party was held up by bad Mexicans, but re
leased when told they were hunting white men. Around Morenci, Clifton and
other towns are settlements of Mexicans, In which outlaws of that nationality,
when close pushed, find hiding places with their countrymen. Not long ago threa
Chinamen were killed for the purpose of robbery. So frequent have deeds of
outlawry become that peaceable citizens, having, to their knowledge, no enemies,
dislike to travel unarmed or without escort anywhere in the hills for fear of
violence. The officers have been vigilant, but the lawless element Is so numer
oub and well secreted that they have been unable to control the situation by
seeking out the perpetrators of Individual crimes.
Resolving that action is urgent. Sheriff Ben R. Clark went to Morenci this
week, where he organized a posse* to go Into the Eagle Creek district It Is the In
tention of these officers to round up every suspicious character in that section and
make him give an account of himself. It is hoped by this means they may be
able to find a clew tb the murderers of Howe and Wheeler. It Is understood that
Sheriff Clark went from Morenci to Globe, where he expected to organize another
posse to scout the. Black River country. Only by breaking up the well known
places of rendezvous can they hope to capture, the leaders of the outlaw gangs.

VANCOUVER. B. C. July K.-The
steamer Cutch arrived this afternoon from
Skajruay. She had fifty Klondikers and
about a quarter of a million de-liars' worth
of gold dust on board. Â¦ : -
Gold Commissioner E. C. Senkler. In
charge of the Government offices at Daw
son. who arrived on the Cutch, eald he
was free to state that he Intended to rec
ommend a reduction in the 10 per cent
royalty now being- collected on Yukon
g-old. He thought this should-be lowered
to 4 or I per cent, and he knew tiiat such
nction would be popular in the Yukon.
He Is now on his way to Ottawa to lay
this matter before the Government, and
â¢will return north In about six weeks.
Commissioner Senkier said that tho
clean-up this year would be about 52.000,
(Xa) moro than last year. He expected It
to fig-ure up to between $19,0*) .000 and $20.-
OOO.(M). The Gold Run clean-up was the
most conspicuous result of the season's
working. There was about $3,500,000 taken
oat as far as claim No. 35 above, and the
whole of the creek was a wonder. Bo
nanza and El Dorado had been almost
completely worked out in former seasons,
and they now were not giving large yields.
Sir. Senkler Bays that there is no neces
sity of reviving the story of last season
that Alex McDonald, the Klondike King,
Is bankrupt, because he is not; but it is a
fact that this year he has not made
money. On some claims, Mr. Senkler says,
McDonald obtained good clean-ups, but
he had heavy losses on other claims and
hla royalties were large. . As a result of
many losses his profits have been eaten
up and he has cleared little or no money
during the season. He is now disposing
of a large number of properties to sev
eral Knglish syndicates and seems to have
a decided idea that a narrowing of his
business Interests is desirable.
On the way up the Yukon Commissioner
Benkler saw the commencement of a new
stampede up the Stewart River. Two hun
dred and fifty men started out on the
night of July 19 for the upper, part of the
Stewart. The details were vague, but
men were said to be taking out SO centa to
the pan.
Just before Senkler left a young man
named Ransom 'was shot by one KinK, an
old man of 65 years, in a dispute about
some property. The old man was arrested
and taken to Dawson.
Mr. Senkler says there were in all but
two cases of smallpox at Dawson, and
they came from up-river, and not from
Nome, as was originally reported. There
had been no new cases for two weeks
before he left, and there was no fear of
an epidemic.
John Sarga. the murderer of Louis Bal
los at Dawson, July 2, 1899, has confessed
to the deed and says he shot Ballos six
times, but claims it was in self-defense.
He is a desperate criminal and several
times recently has attempted to escape.
Among the lucky "Dawson men on the
Cutch are Louis Lase and T. Venan of
San Francisco, who have about $100,000 be
tween them, the other passengers having
the remainder of the gold cargo In smaller
lots. -<r.

SACRAMENTO, July 2S.â Had tho
Southern Pacific pay car left this city
for Placerville last night it probably
would have been wrecked at Manlove
switch, about eight miles east of Sacra

robbers. Last evening George Harlow and
a man named Silva, living in the locality,
noticed from the target that the switch
had been thrown open. Any train which
might have come along the main track in
the direction of Folsom would have run

SAN RAFAEL, July 28.â The lair of the
famous wild man of Mount Tamalpals has
In all probability been discovered by Dep
uty Sheriff Edward Watson, who is em
ployed as a watchman on the mountain.
Watson reports that he discovered by the
merest accident a brush cabin in one of
tho brushlest and most inaccessible can
yons of the mountain.
Borne days ago while riding: up the road
he went out on a small ridgo to get a bet
ter view of the country, when he noticed
what appeared to be a well-beaten trail
leading into the gulch. Tying his horse,
he darted to investigate. The trail zig
zagged in & bewildering manner for a con
siderable distance, then it led across and
over a ledge of rocks, at the foot of which
was. a small- flat, or bench, twenty or
thirty feet square. Under a large moun
tain oak in the upper end of the clearing
was a neatly built brush house, construct
ed something on the plan of an Indian
basket. In the cabin was a rude bunk
made of poles: It was covered with a
layer of leaves and dirt to a depth of sev
eral inches. Watson's attention was im
mediately attracted to a large dirk knife,
which had been driven to its hilt in the
covering and in the center of the bed. He
carried this weapon away with him as a
relic.
Lying scattered about the ground near
the hut were many pieces of wearing ap
parel, they having evidently been cut or
torn to shreds, a few old cans and feath
ers from bluejays and woodpeckers.
It is very unlikely that any hunter
would locate In so inhospitable a place,
end. besides, the variety of birds evident
ly killed or trapped by the occupant were
not such as tire usually considered edible.
Borne months ago rumors of a wild man
en the mountain were current, but they
were generally disbelieved. The present
find of "Watson gives color to the story.
If the wild man still lives he has certainly
removed his hiding place to some more
secluded nook.

through hl3 attorneys. Harkless. O'Grady
& Cryster, Judge John W. Henry of the
Circuit Court In chambers to-day granted
an injunction ejecting the Western Colon

off or prohibit the Christie-Street Com

The principal grounds on which they
seek the injunction are: 'That the mar

they are impressed with a public Interest
and when sent over the wires or placed
upon the wires that every person who

lieved his father killed himself because of
thp trouble. He also said his father's rel
atives were living in Little Rock. Ark.,

Coroner Muller sent messages to the
Masonic lodge at Red Bluff and to Ar
kansas relatives, notifying them of Har
ris' death. No replies have been received

the subject, "The Twentieth Century and
Temperance." \
States army and along with thousands of
other Christian people of the land we
deprecate with earnest feeling the official
action in regard to the canteen that not
only disregarded the moral interests of
our brave soldiery but practically nullified
the will of the people, as formally and
authoritatively expressed in the law of
Congress."
Rev. McKenzie Clelland of Chicago of
fered a resolution recommending that the
motto "God Whose I Am and Who I
Serve" be adopted in place of the union's
motto. "Whose We Are and Whom We
Serve," which he characterized as un
grammatical. meaningless, godless and "a
perversion of the Holy Scriptures." The
resolution was unanimously adopted and

Trial Conies to a Sudden Adjourn
ment Owing 1 to the Illness of
One of the Jurors.
NEW LOXDOX, Mo.. July 23.âEx-Gov
ernor Charles P. Johnson cf St. Louis, on
behalf of the prosecution., addressed the
Jury In the trial of Alexander Jester. He
depicted the murder in ail its horror, and
said it was a rtuty he owed to the State
as well as himself to see that justice was
meted out to the prisoner..
As the iawyer proceeded A. XI. Gates,
father, of the murdered boy. buried his
face in his handkerchief and wept. Alex
Jester cast his eye to the speaker, then to
the Judge, then to the floor. Governor
Johnson said John W. Gates would- not be
a man if he did not spend his money 'in
bringing the murderer of his brother to
Justice.
J. W. Hays, -who followed, made in his
address to the jury what the defense
claim may prove a reversible error. He
called Jester a bigamist. He said that
Jester married a woman in Oklahoma
while he had a wife in Kansas. Â¦
The trial came to a sudden adjournment
this afternoon en account of a sick juror.

To the Editor of The Call: In connec
tion with the very lucid and interesting
article in' Saturday's issue by Civil En
gineer Fergusson relative to the present
Chinese complications it is noteworthy
to recall some statements made by "Chi
nese" Gordon several years ago which not
only Indorse Mr. Fergusson's observa
tions but which, when read in the light
made visible by recent events, assume a
veritably prophetic chaxacter.
"Chinese" Gordon says: "Never trust
a mandarin, great or small. With all their
hideous superstitions, their vices and
their ignorance the Chinese are far too
good for their nobles, or whatever you
like to call the rulers of the people.
"They, the rulers, will buy guns and
rifles and ships and with the aid of Eu
ropean drill will organize an army and
Instill the leaven of uprising into the in
ert mass of millions of men- until they
combine to overwhelm the 'foreign devils,'
whom they hate like poison."
It would seem that this long foreshad
owed avalanche of diplomacy awaits only
the breath of illy concealed intrigue 'to
confirm the prophecy and to consummate
the official corruption which In ita descent
will crush Indifferently both the victims
of its greed and the "devils" of foreign
civilization. ,- '
It Is to be regretted that the clearly
defined shadows of "coming events"
should be so persistently ignored until
their "material" evidence presents prob
lems of grave moment and of .difficult

"CHINESE" . GORDON'S PROPHECY.
â¢ In support, of that statement the Press says that in
one day's clippings from exchanges it found more
than sixty instances of death resulting from the wires.
Sixty electrocutions in one day. is a fearful record,
but with the increase in the number of overhead wires
it will soon be surpassed. The fires are about' 33
numerous as the deaths, and many disastrous con
flagrations result from comparatively slight disturb
ances of the wires. Thus in one case cited: "A
trimmer in a window of a millinery store, while ar
ranging a display, short circuited the wires, and fire
spread rapidly. Loss, $250,000." In another case it
is said: "Boys threw objects attached to a string
over the wires of a district messenger line and an arc
light circuit, drawing them ' together.' The nieht
UPON the side of the reformers who have been
striving to compel the removal from our cities
of all overhead electric wires there is likely to
be soon arrayed a powerful ally â none other than the
I combined force of all. the life and fire insurance com
panies of the Union. The overhead wires are prov
ing to be so perilous to person and to property that
in self-defense the insurance men will have to demand
their removal under a threat of raising rates in every
city where such wires are tolerated..
The Insurance Press of New York for July 18 gives
a startling array of facts showing the deadliness of the
wires. It says: "What a record electricity is making!
Not the flash from the surcharged cloud, but the
silent current of the wires that are strung like a
dragnet over the land. Day by day the roster of the
dead grows. Day by day the deadly wires add more
miles to other circuits. Literally, our homes, high
ways, villages, towns and .cities are invaded, en
veloped, surrounded. Loss of life and destruction of
property are of such constant occurrence that- the
startled community, reading "the frightful record of
death and disaster by broken, crossed, defective and
overloaded wires, cries everywhere for relief from the
omnipresent terror." :
THE MENACE OF THE WIRES.
According to the estimates of Lord Tweedmouth,
the expenditure of the South African war will amount
to a sum so large that it will have virtually cost the
British about $15,000 for each Boer in the Transvaal,
and his lordship is inclined to think they are' not
worth the money, even with their gold mines
thrown in.
We appeal to the people, who are in charge of
these worthy and interesting projects to not defeat
themselves â¢ and leave the trees to destruction by
pushing both upon the attention of Congress at the
same time.
Driven tandem both may go through, where both
will fail driven abreast, v
They stand now wholly at the mercy of the owner,
may be reduced to beards and shakes at any time,
and the purchase of the Santa Cruz tract was not
advanced a particle by getting in the way of the
other.
Immediately Congress felt itself in the presence of
two schemes to sell timber to the Government; all
kinds of false scents were apparent to the legislative
nose, and no bill was passed to save the Calaveras
trees.
This was favorably reported to the House and the
Senate, and just then appeared the petition for the
purchase of the Santa Cruz redwoods at a cost of
probably more than a million, perhaps two millions
of dollars.
Congress had initiated the purchase of that grove
by authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to bond
it. His views of the method of proceeding were not
at one with those of the owner, and a bill was intro
duced providing for the judicial adjustment of the
title and purchase of the property.
THE effort to save the redwood forests of the
Santa Cruz Mountains is worthy of praise and,
at the proper time, of encouragement. It seems,
however, from reports that have reached us from
Washington, that it appeared in Congress just in time
to sidetrack the effort to save the Calaveras grove of
big trees.
SAVE THE TREES.
1/ The Prohibitionists, it is said, will adopt Bryan's
tactics of 1S96 in this campaign and will hire .n
special train to carry their candidate, Mr. Woollev,
on a speaking tour of the country. He will talk from
the platform of the rear car, will not have to hire a
meeting-place, and thereby will save money. Thus
the old advice. "Hire a hall," will have to give way
to "Plire a train."
acter which bears so heavily upon Na
tionalist local life and aspirations. On
Monday he will appeal to the Tories to
"come over and help us" against the
Dublin corporation and Its supporters in
the House, of whom he should, of course,
be one. On Thursday he will eat every
thing he said on Monday, as he did on
Thursday last by a speech which exact*
ly harmonized with the spirit, at any
rate, of Irish tradition. This, as Mr.
Chamberlain would say, Is pretty Fan
ny's way.
The students of the honorable gentle
man's methods have not quite satisfied
themselves that he thinks upon his legs.
His speeches, like those of the present
week, irresistibly suggest careful and
elaborate study. They savor of much oil,
though their spirit is more suggestive per
haps of the electric light. Mr. Healy.
anyway, bears himself in his walks like
a man oblivious to this world and medi
tating upon a brief for another planet. His
sardonic temperament flnd3 a special fit
ness in what some one called the honora
ble and learned gentleman's "gunpowder"
complexion. He looks like a fighter: and
his cold stare indicates a determination,
actual or simulated, to treat all men alike
with contempt. He Is a free lance, and
is an Irish Hal o* the Wynd, but not in
the mercenary sense. He cannot help it.
and it fits in with what is called "the gen
tle art of making enemies." But Mr.
Healy has no notion of making himself
the best hated man in Ireland. It Is all
the resultV of being misunderstood. Mr.
Baifour once said of the difficulty of sat
isfying the demands of the Ulster mem
bers, "I know what the eighty-five Na
tionalists want, but I cannot understand
what the twenty-two Irish Conservatives
want." Mr. Healy probably knows what
he would have his party do, but the party
is unable to analyze Healyism. conse
quently It shares the difficulty of Mr. Bai
four in regard to Ulster and Its represent
atives.
Mr. Healy is entirely a self-made man.
IT has been said of an eighteenth cen
tury classic that if he had burnt all
he wrote and published all he spoke, a
very acceptable book would have been
given to the world. That may not be said
of the honorable Member for North
Louth: first, because he has nothing to
burn; and secondly, because his speeches
must be heard to be enjoyed. This is un
fortunate for literature, but it v.'ill ease
the task of the historian. When Timothy
Healy describes a certain bill as the off
spring of "a headache at the Irish Of
fice," or twits the Government with
"feeding a dog with a bit of his own
tall." he must be seen and not read. This
is to be regretted from the point of view
of literature, but not from that of the
Irish landlords who would be its principal
victims. A new Irish Government "dole"
bill, now before the House of Commons,
is meeting with a good deal of Nationalist
opposition, and it is almost needless to
say that Mr. Healy Is at the head of this
congenial campaign. He is facile princeps
in all matters of invective. He believes
In the power of ridicule to kill at any
range; and he uses his weapon unspar
ingly. But there is at all times a winning
delicacy of touch in his humor which
alleviates the pain of Its wriggling vic
tim and makes death, in a way, amusing.
One of Mr. Healy's principal targets la
the honorable and gallant Member for
North Armagh, another is the honorable
Member for South Belfast. But the Par
liamentary tournament has this relieving
quality, all who may be unsaddled or left
to bite the dust live to fight another day.
So Colonel Saunderson and Mr. Johnston
invariably come up smiling whenever
there is a landlord to defend or an "in
terest" to succor against the raids of
gentlemen opposite. In these raids Mr.
Healy leads; and the service which he
renders to the cause common to allâ that
of "Ireland for the Irish" â condones a
tendency to smite the cheek of his own
friends indiscriminately with the enemy.
Herein we obtain an instructive view of
that negative side of Mr. Healy's char-
but his great natural ability. Irrespective
ot his courage and his contempt of opin
ions, obstacles or traditions, -would alone
have pushed him to the front. This is the
more noticeable in one who passed most
f>t his youth In a railway office, for It will
be admitted that a diet of railway bills of
lading is scarcely a preparation for legis
lation, a seat in Parliament, a good posi
tion at the Irish bar and perhaps a seat
upon the bench of the Four Courts ltseTf.
But a fondness for the pen, in the groovo
of patriotic Journalism, coupled to a for
tunate marriage, caused the hero of hU
own epie to leave the rail-way a long way
behind. Mr. Healy came to the front aa
private secretary to Mr. Parnell in the lu
crative days of Kilmalnham â lucrative in
the reputation-making sense. Tet to Mr.
Healy history will accord most of the re
sponsibility for Mr. Parnell's defeat In
committee room 15. His leading charac
teristic Is sturdiness to a purpose, and
this Is to be seen in all hl3 public dealings.
He has made Parliamentary insolence a
fine art. and his irreverent description of
Mr. Speaker Peel "sitting on the pounce"

clared to have been sublimated in a por
trait of the ex-Speaker by a renowned TU
A. It Is untrue, however, that he pic
tured Mr. (now Sir) Henry Campbell-Ban

tary as. "an attempt to govern Ireland
with Scotch Jokes." Â¦ Mr. Healy Is noth
ing If not industrious, and he Is said to
have been the only M. P. of his day to
grasp Mr. Gladstone's great Irish land
act. He is known to banter as "Chief Jus
tice Healy," and to the statute as author
of the "Healy clause," which rescued ten
ants' Improvements. In his private rela
tions Mr. Healy Is said to be as soft aa
velvet and aa playful as a kitten. But in
the House, or even in its lobby, there is
no opening for tenderness of this kind
whether the tradition be well founded of
not. Yet he can keep and even fill tho

looker" in the London Chronicle.
E. I. Wolfe, aspirant for the Republican nomination
in the Twenty-first Senatorial District, and H. C. Dib
ble, aspirant for nomination in the Forty-first Assem
bly District, are types of politicians who are of no
benefit to their constituencies or to their party. They
are of the species of legislators in whom corporations
delight and for whom Mint saloon bosses cast the
gang vote. The nomination of either of those men
will discredit the convention that gives it and weaken
the whole ticket. Moreover, such a nomination will
not assure election. It will serve merely to give th"
opposition in the district something like a walkover
unless, indeed, the Democratic bosses in the railroad
combine put up weak candidates against them. In
any case decent Republicans will refuse to vote for
them, and The Call will make public ample reasons
for the refusal. . V ///:.:Â¦.
There is nothing that calls for compromise with
cither bosses like Crimmins and Kelly or candidates
like Dibble and Wolfe. Plain dealing is best. The
Call is a loyal Republican newspaper, and by reason
of its loyalty to all that is good and patriotic in the
party refuses to give even a silent consent to the
toleration within it of any corrupt and corrupting
force.
It can hardly be necessary for The Call to publish
at this time the record of either Dibble or Wolfe.
They have been in politics for a good many years,
have been honored with scats in the Legislature, and
the people are fairly familiar with what they are.
Neither of them has ever represented in politics any
thing but its worst. elements; never served anything
in the State except corrupt corporations, nor ever
served them without a purpose. What is already
well known of their course in the Legislature should
be sufficient to defeat their schemes for nomination
by a Republican convention. Should it not be suffi
cient, however, The Call is prepared to publish
enough of the record of each of them to justify all
Republicans in voting against them, not only in con
vention, but at the polls.
AGAIN and again The Call has warned the peo
ple of the danger that menaces local and State
politics in this election. It has pointed out
the existence oi a combination of railroad bosses and
Mint saloon bosses, organized for the purpose of con
trolling the next Legislature. It has directed atten
tion to the fact that State Senators elected this year
will hold over for the succeeding session and have a
voice in the election oi a. United States Senator to
succeed Senator Perkins, and to the further fact that
zt the session next winter the Assembly, Senatorial
Â£hd Congressional districts will be fixed for ten years
to come. It has urged all the belter elements of the
Republican party to UTate in a vigorous effort to de
feat the boss-es and baffle their schemes. It has called
upon them day after day to register, to enroll in their
district c!::bs, to take part in the nomination of dele
gates for the county convention, to oppose any boss
ticket that may be put up, and to continue the fight
zgainst the bosses and their tools until the pells close
en election day.
What The Call has urged others to do it is willing
to do itself. It is making a straight, definite con
test for honest politics and good government, and
evades no issue nor avoids any foe that confronts it.
It has named the bosses who are to be beaten. It has
cfcnounced Crimmins and Kelly as the particular
bosses who are at this time to be driven out of the
Republican party, and, moreover, it has named Henry
C Dibble and E. I. Wolfe as aspirants for Republi
can nominations who must be defeated â men against
â¢whom the fight must be carried on from start to fin
ish, whom a decent Republican must oppose even
should the}' by any means obtain the party nomina
tion.
DIBBLE AND WOLFE AS EXAMPLES.
The famine, it is to be understood, is an economic
one and not a natural one. There is plenty of coal
not only in Great Britain, but in Germany. It hap
pens, however, that at this time it cannot be produced
cheaply enough to provide the vast industrial plants
of those countries with the fuel they need. Thus the
United States has an immense. advantage in the in
dustrial and commercial struggle that is going on
among the civilized nations. There is no lack of coal
on this continent, nor is there likely to; be for cen
turies to come.
The coal question in England is. however, much
greater than a mere problem of war. It affects all
the industrial and the commercial interests of the na
tion. While the British have not suffered from a
coal famine to anything like the extent of Germany
and Austria, the advancing price has been a serious
drawback to manufacturing. The Manchester cor
respondent of the London Chronicle recently wrote to
that journal: "Matters in connection with the Lan
cashire and Yorkshire coal industry are reported to
be assuming a most serious aspect, the demand being
far in excess of the supply, a state of things, to some
extent, due to short time worked by colliers. A cir
cular has been recently issued to coal-owners, which
states that the country is on the verge of another coal
famine, and that any political disturbance or interna
tional trouble may cause a run on a trade already ren
dered sensitive from various causes. The collieries
during the past year have not kept pace with the in
creasing demand consequent upon the enormous ac
tivity throughout coal-using industries.''
REPLYING to a question in Parliament on
Wednesday, Baifour, speaking for the Govern
. ment, stated that a bill now before the Com
mons designed to prohibit the export of. munitions
of war includes coal as well as other military stores.
JThe question was asked because of an excitement
created by the large export of "steam coal" to
France, admittedly for use in the French navy. The
particular kind of coal the French have been buying
emits comparatively little smoke, and is therefore of
great advantage for naval uses in time of war. The
British have for some time past been disturbed by
the export of that kind of coal, and it now appears
the export is to be prohibited, or at least restricted
to the same extent as other munitions of war.

MR. TAT PAY HEALY-MEMBER FROM NORTH LODTH.
A CONTEMPORANEOUS PARLIAMENTARY PORTRAIT.
It is highly probable that Mr. Croker, who began
his public career Â«s .1 Coroner, will easily rise from
handling the dead to administering on the estate. He
will not only be administrator but residuary legatee
also, for whatever comes out of this campaign will
fall to him alone as the sovereign ruler of Greater
New York.
It was plainly to be seen at Kansas City that the
show of life in the party was due entirely to the am
bitions of a few and the fanaticism and prejudice of a
few more. Thq question was not so much this year's
campaign, but who shall control the organization for
1904. In other words, it was a question of who
should administer on the estate of the decedent.
The Gold Democracy seem to stand together upon
a principle which formerly cemented the whole party,
and show the courage of their convictions by sup
porting those who befriend that principle. In that
way the old Free Soiiers stood, gaining the balance
of power in many States, until the Republican party
issued from their loins. This year there seems to be
no doubt of their position, and perhaps in the future
the country must look to them for that opposition
party which is necessary' to the politics of a' republic.
It is probable that the Whig party died during the
administration of John Tyler, but did not miss its
breath until eight years after it had left its body.
So it is probable that Bryan Democracy is at this
moment down among the dead men.
Its attempt at accretion of Populism, Silver Repub
licanism, MormoniSm' and Coxey-armyism,' together,
is perhaps merely the post-mortem desire of the dead
to have folks at the wake.
The trouble with the Whig party was that it ceased
to have principles which were a common cement in
even' part of the Union. Many of its members agreed
with the position of the Democracy, as many Demo
crats now agree with that of the Republicans.
Others were Free Soilers and were the founders of
the Republican party. Still others became Know
Nothings, the ante-type of the Chinese Boxers.
It would appear as if that keen-sighted politician,
David B. Hill, saw the situation when he commended
the platform in his speech at Kansas City, for he said
some parts of it would be advocated in one section of
the country and other parts in other sections. When
it comes to that in a party it is on the verge of dis
integrating. When it has no common principle, fol
lowed, fought for and believed in by all its members,
everywhere, its days rre numbered.
It was so with the Whig party after the defeat of
Scott, h won in i8}.8 over a divided opposition that
was hopelessly entangled in the quarrel between Van
Buren and Cass, and held the Presidency up to March
4. 1S53. and immediately passed out of existence.
Here and there old men calling themselves "silver
greys" and "old line Whigs" used to consort, but
they had no party. Many of them followed the ex
ample of Jo Davicss. who never voted again after
the Federal party breathed its last.
There you have it. Haldeman leaves the Gold
Democracy to fight expansion, and his paper can't
live South of Mason and Dixon's line without favor
ing what he personally opposes.
Now Mr. Haldeman is part-owner and business
manager of the Louisville Courier-Journal, and has
found it necessary in order to hold the circulation of
his paper in the South to let Mr. Watterson, his part
ner and editor, make it the most rabid expansion
paper in the country!
The confusion that has followed fusion was further
shown at the meeting: of the committee of the Gold
Democracy at Indianapolis on the 25th. There was
one defection there. Mr. Haldeman of Kentucky
resigned from the committee and declared himself for
Bryan. He denounced free silver, but said it had be
come an impossibility, and he must follow his warm
admiration for freedom in all her forms by support
ing Mr. Bryan as her gentleman friend and opposing
expansion.
"paramount issue" is antagonized there, and the party
is also opposed to free silver at any ratio, as was
demonstrated by ten out of fifteen Southern States
voting against it at Kansas City.
7 -HERE are certain signs of a break-up in the
Democratic party led by Bryan. Throughout
the South it is an expansion party and wants
to hold the Philippines:, wants a cotton market, wants
commisfions in the army â wants, in fact, everything
it can lay hands on. In Tennessee Judge Snodgrass
is its candidate for the Senate, and is making his cam
paign as an expansionist of the most wide-open type.
In Alabama Senator Morgan has just beaten Gov
ernor Johnston in the party primaries by five to one
on the same issue. So it runs throughout the South,
which gives the party 120 members of the House and
about all of the electoral votes it will get. The
FUSION AND CONFUSION.
For some years past every municipality in the
United States has been engaged with more or less
earnestness in an effort to get rid of the overhead
wires, but even in the most progressive communities
such efforts have been rewarded with but compara
tively little success. Sooner or later, however, the
desired end will be achieved, and the agitation of the
subject by the insurance men will help amazingly in
hastening it.
As to the effect of the wires upon life and fire
risks, the Press says: "Every day adds new testi
mony to the already amazing record of property de
struction^ and peril to life and limb inseparable from
the use of electricity for lighting and power, and as
there is a daily increase in these uses the present
and the future risks of fire insurance companies may
well alarm insurers and insured." In another con
nection ;t says: "The electric companies go right on
multiplying the dangers regardless of results. And
they will continue to go right on until an aroused
public sentiment says 'Stop!' to the further use of
fire-causing and death-dealing overhead wires."
being wet, the wires carried the high tension current
into four buildings, causing fire in each."

Upon a former occasion I had the pleas
. ure of calling attention to the -use and
progress of the People's Theater of Vi
enna,.as chronicled by William Archer In
the Theatrical World for 1S97. Not less
interestingâ in some respects more inter
estingâIs the history of the People's The
ater of Berlin, as narrated by Edith Sel
lers in the Contemporary Review for
June.
The People's Theater of Vienna was
started with the immense advantage of a
splendid site, donated by the Emperor.
The People's Theater of Berlin is the re
sult of the almost unaided exertions of
one manâ a poor man and a dramatic crlt- I
1c at that!
Some nine years ago this dramatic critic
âLoewenfeld by nameâ began preaching to
the people of Berlin the doctrine which we
express in English by the homely proverb,
"All work and no play makes Jack a dull
boy." The mechanic, the teamster, the
sewing-girl who have been tolling all day
are not so much in need of night classes
and university extension lectures as they
are of a good theater where, for a sum
within their limited means, they can be
temporarily lifted out of the dull routine
of the common task, where, their imagina
tion can be excited, their feelings touched
and their hearts be made to throb in.
; unison with the great heart of humanity.
Nine years ago there was no such thea
ter in Berlin. Excellent theaters there
* were, but their prices were prohibitive
to the poor of the city and that meant 75
per cent of the population. How to pro
vide these hundreds of thousands of peo
ple with a theater where they could see
the best plays artistically rendered at a
cost not to exceed 25 cents for the best
seatsâ this was the problem Lowenfeld
set himself to solve. And in spite of most
heartrending discouragements he has
solved it. This is how he did it.
Having decided that $37,500 was the
smallest working capital with which he
might dare to begin, he formed a limited
liability company to issue 3oo shares at
$125 per share. He then secured the names
of some Influential men in Berlin to in
dorse his scheme, and sent out 2000 circu
lars to the rich men of the city appealing
to them to subscribe? for the stock. In
this circular he promised that if the thea
ter was started "no propaganda of any
kind, social, political or religious, should
be tolerated." The seed of this appeal fell
indeed upon stony ground. To the 20:30 cir
culars only eighty replies were received,
and the majority of these eighty consist
ed of excuses for not subscribing. The
miserable sum of $10,000 was the net re
sult of this appeal to the rich of Berlin â
that is, to the people who could easily
afford to go to the theater themselves,
and who therefore failed to realize that
the poor needed amusement and humani
zation as well as they. Professional men
âartists authors, university professorsâ
were next written to. and they responded
somewhat better; $15,000 represented the
sum gf their subscriptions. This made
$25 000 in hand, but all efforts to raise the
remaining $12,500 were fruitless.
Most men at this stage of the game, I
think would have cried out a hearty
amen to Mr Vanderbilt's famous denun
ciation of the public and would have
thrown down the cards In disgust. Not so
Loewonfeld; he was made of sterner sturr,
of such are martyrs. Confronted with the
alternative of abandoning the enterprise
altogether or cf taking a risk compared
with which a Cape Nome beach claim Is a
sure thing, he chose the latter; he actu
ally started the Peoples Theater-2o cents
for the best seats, remember with Schil
ler and Shakespeare on the bill. Hfl actu
ally started such an enterprise on a capi
tal of $25 000. Expenses for the first year
he knew would be about as follows:
Rent of a tluater (tho Schiller)... $15,000
Lighting and heating 3,000
Wear and tear of hcenery, prop
â¢ erties. etc 2.^00
Salaries â¢ **.Â£â¢Â»{
Sundries 1 -"*-'Â°
Total SS1.000
The .Schiller Theater scats 120") people.
In order to take In this JSl.tXW Loewenfeld
knew that at his^prlces he must have full
houses 160 days In th** year. If he had
onlv two-thirds houses by the <-nd of the
year he would have lost practically all
his capital. This last mentioned result
was affably predicted for him by the wise
acres, and they certainly had appearances
on their side. On his side was confidence
in himself as a manager and confidence
that the masses needed and would appre
ciate what he proposed to give them.
To insure full houses every night a reg
ular clientele Is necessary'. To obtain this
Loewenfeld. with the aid of all the non
polltical labor organizations he could
reach, organized the Theater Union. Each
member of this union buys a little book
containing six tickets, one of which is
good for the same seat on say six alter
nate Tuesdays. These tickets, if for the
gallery, cost but 6 cents apiece. They
may bo paid for on installment and may
be resold by the purchaser. When the
book Is used up the spectator may buy
another book for another night of the
week, but he cannot change from one
nfarht to another on the same book. This
simple device does much to prevent an
overflow house one night and a poor one
another night. Loewenfeld sold six thou
sand of these books before he opened the
doors of his theater.
The first performance of the People's
Theater was given on the 30th of August,
]JM. The play was Schiller's "Die Raeu
ir." The house was crowded v.1th an
audience filled with curiosity and fore-
bodinp. It was not supposea mat so am
bitious a play could be properly rendered
with the limited means at the director's
command and with the low-salaried actors
whom he was obliged to employ. Happily
the croakers croaked in vain. It was
afrain demonstrated that with an uplift
ing play and a first rate directing mind
excellent results can be obtained with ,i
company that contains not a sinjr!* 1 Stan
The tlrst performance at the People \a
Theater was a Krf-at success, as all tha
critics acknowledged.

it-id's policy, as announced In his own
words, was: "To-Uay Schiller and Cal
deron, to-morrow Ilebel and Ibsen; to-day-
Sophocles, to-morrow Shakespeare: to
day Faust, to-morrow * Vielchenfreaser.'
â¢ â¢ â¢ On us everything has a claim that
expresses noble thoughts in a beautiful
form." This policy has been adhered to.
Moreover, the detestable long run system
has never been permitted to effect a lodg
ment in the People's Theater. The result
is that the theater has in its repertoire
no less than one hundred and thirty-six
plays. "More. I am inclined to think."
say's Miss Sellers, "than all the London
theaters put together."
At the end of the first year the People'3
Theater had given artistic productions of
thirty-seven different plays. Including
such pieces as Schiller's "Wallenstein"
and Ibsen's "Brand." and did not lose a.
dollar. Since then it has so prospered
that It now pays the shareholders 5 per
cent Interest and has a surplus profit to
devote to permanent improvements.
Kvery now and then Loewenfeld. on a.
Wednesday afternoon, invites 1200 school
children to witness some masterpiece, and
great then is the rejoicing in the heart
of young Berlin. The actors are now
Klven a two months' holiday every year,
and the scale of prices, though slightly
advanced, la still astonishingly lowâ six
cents for the poorest seats and thirty
seven for the best.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Is such a theater possible In San Fran
cisco to-day? I think not, and for two
reasons. First, we have not. so far as t
know, any Loewenfeld with genius for
theatrical organization and a â¢willingness
to endure the slinks and arrows of that
outrageous fortune which would surely
select him as a shining mark. Second, as
a people we have nor yet learned to tako
our theater seriourly and a manasrer
whose repertoire was dVawn from Fehil
ler. Calderon, Hebel, Ibsen, Sophocles,
Shakespeare and Goethe would not. I
think, play to rnore than half houses even
at thirty-seven cents for tie best seats.
AVlth our higher scale of salaries that
would mean a loss of about 150.000 a year.
Now. $50,000 a year is just the Interest, at
5 per cent, on a million dollars â which, in
turn. Is Just the sum we need for an en
dowed theater that shall do for our peo
ple what the gallant I^oewenfeld is do!n?

Professor Joseph W. Richards, at a re
eest meeting of the Franklin Institute,
la Philadelphia, delivered an address up
cn progress in the aluminum industry.
Two points therein discussed have
cj-T'eciai interest to the Pacific Coast. Pro
fessor Richards' conclusions will prob
f^-bly be debated more or less. "Electric
-"onductors," said Professor Richards,"
y czzi now be laid more cheaply in alum
inum than in copper. This is indeed a
startling statpment when first heard, for
tlmort every one Is wont to consider cop
per as the metal par excellence for con
ductors. But pure aluminium has over S)
per cent the conductivity of pure copper.
tind is fully as strong and resistant to at
mospheric influences. It Is therefore only
necessary to take an aluminum wire one
tourth as large again in diameter as a
copper wire Â«giving a little over 50 per
cent more pecJon) to get equal conduc
tivity. Such a wire weighs one-half as
much as the copper wire it replaces, and
costs only two-thirds as much. Lor.g
Â«iistance transmission lines and trcllcy

Used for this purpose last year, and prob
ubiy double as much will be used this
year. This one use of aluminum prom
ises in the near future to consume it3
thousands of tons a year."
Concerning the use of aluminum in a.1

Baby Show, Exciting Contests and
Dancing Made the Outing a
Success â Results of the
Races.
â¢ .
Barring a baby show, which created
some feeling in the minds of fond
mothers whose children were not award
ed prizes, the annual reunion of the par
ishioners of St. Joseph's Church, heM
yesterday in -Shell Mound Park, was a
brilliant success. There was a large at
tendance and not an accident or incident
marred the pleasures of the day. The
picnic grounds being so close to the city,
the parishioners were enabled to journey
there during the afternoon and every
train deposited a large crowd of pleasure
seekers.
The knowledge that a baby show for
prizes would be a star feature of the day's
programme was sufficient lor the mat
rons. Every one of them brought their
cooing darlings along and every house
hold joy was dressed in his or her very
best bib and tucker. More than fifty
babes were entered for the contest and as
usual there were not enough prizes to go
around. Mothers held interested audi
ences while they expatiated on the tine
dualities of their cherubs, and after the
ririzes were awarded relatives held indig
nation and sympathy meetings. The
1ud<?e3 of the contest had no sinecure and
before they had reached their decision
were sorry they had ever accepted the
honor of choosing the handsomest and
fattest bov and girl babies In the bunch.
Mrs M J. Maguire, Mrs. A. F. Black
and'Mrs. J. J. Miley acted as judges of

Hugh Buchanan's Case De
cided by Supreme Court
in His Favor.
He Will Be Sent Back to Yuba to Be
Trisd for a Murder Com
mitted Five Years
Ago.
VAPA July 28. â The decision of the Su
preme Court* in tho Hugh Buchanan case
meets with general approval by Napa peo
ple When notified to-day of the court's
decision in his case Buchanan was de
lighted and expressed a great desire to
go back to Marysville and stand trial for
his crime in preference to being confined
in the Napa State Hospital under Dr.
Gardner. ; He said that he could hardly
tell how he did feel to know that he was
a sane man now, but thought that he
would really realize it again.
District Attorney Bell of this county,
who first took the Buchanan case in
hand and later ceased his activity in it be
cause of his , being a public officer, is
highly elated over the outcome and his
victory over Dr. Gardner and the tatter's
attorneys. Buchanan will be taken to
Marysville as -soon as the proper time
comes. WBfefmUgBBE^aSQgfe^t^gi
JJucanan was not called as a witness,
but simply to show the condition of his
mind, and hj made a very rational state
ment of fa^s pertaining to himself. The
expert testimony was very conflicting,
some of the asylum physicians differing
very materially from Dr. Gardner. Chief
Justice Beatty, who wrote the opinion,
takes the position that habeas corpus is
supreme over all laws and statutes, and
that the superintendent of an asylum for
the care of the insane Is not superior to
the laws of the land. If the ( applicant is
sane he is entitled to have a trial and
judgment as to his guilt or innocence, as
guaranteed by the constitution; to keep
him under restraint all of his life would
be to deprive him of his legal rights. The
higher court went into the facts as well
as the law, and found that Buchanaxi
showed perfect possession of his faculties
and a complete ability to conduct his de
fense. It will be seen that this was oppo
eite to the findings of Judge Jones, who
declared that the man was insane. The
order of the higher court was that Bu
chanan be returned to the custody of the
Sheriff of Yuba County; that his trial in
the Superior Court of that county might
be proceeded with. Justice McFarland
differed from his associates as to the
man's sanity. '
A year ago friends and relatives began
proceedings to have the man removed to
1'uba for trial, claiming that he had re
covered his â¢ normal mental condition
which Dr. A. M. Gardner denied. The
late Judge Jones then occupied the Napa
bench, and he decided that proceedings
would have to be begun In the countv
from which the man had been committed.
This the Supreme Court overruled and
Buchanan's petition for a writ of habeas
corpus was allowed. Far three weeks a
dozen of the brightest lawyers in the
State were engaged in the case in -Napa,
and the result was that Buchanan was
declared by Judge Jones to be insane and
he was committed back to the custody of
Dr. Gardner. Another application for a
writ of habeas corpus was made to the
Supreme Court and allowed. Months ago
this was taken up and the unusual spec
tacle was presented of an alleged insane
man appearing in the Supreme Court as
an "exhibit."
The Supreme Court in the Hugh Bu
chanan habeas corpus case has decided
that even where a person's sanity is in
question he has the right of habeas cor
pus, although the superintendent of an
Insane asylum may pronounce the appli
cant mentally irre*ponsible. Heretofore
the statutes of the State have been very
liberally construed on this point, and the
judgment of the superintendent of an asy
lum as to a person's sanity was accepted
as final. Five years ago Hugh Buchanan
while on a drunken spree killed a man in
Marysville, Yuba County. After the trial
had been in progress several days the
defense set up that the murderer was not
of sound mind. The Judge suspended the
trial and called in another'jury to try the
issue of Buchanan's sanity. This jury
concluded .that the man was insane and
he was committed to Xapa.

All former decisions in which it was
hr!d that a deputy mineral surveyor could
r.ot locate claims for mineral lands, on
the pround that he is a United States of
ficer havo bpen overturned by the Serre
tary'of the Interior In a decision involving
the" location of mineral claims in Cripple
Creek Colo. W. H. Iyofflngwell made en
tries in December, 1S37. for three groups
of claims. After the entries were made
the Land Department refused to issue
ratc-nts and held the entries invalid for
the reason stated above. The decision
wns rendered in September. 1S03. In this
last opinion it is held that the section of
the Revised Statutes heretofore quoted
does not apply to mineral land surveyors,
inasmuch as they are not employes of the
Government within the meaning of the
law. and they can make entries for min
eral lands ar.d receive patents therefor..
This applies to mineral land surveyors
everywhere.

THE will of the late Henry D. Cogs

queathinff the bulk of a $500,000 es
tate to his wife, Caroline E. Cogs
well, was filed yesterday in the County
Clerk's office by Attorneys Reed & Xus
bnumer, of Oakland, for William G. Hen
shaw, executor of the estate.
The will consists of the original testa
ment, dated October 6, 1*09. and a codi
; cil dated November 17, 1S33," which revokes
i two bequests made in the body of the inâ
1 strument. The original bears the names
: of Dr. George Chismore and Dr. Beverly
j MacMcnagJe, both of San Francisco, as
! witnesses, and the codicil signature was
i witnessed by George E. Jackson and
I Percy C. Black, both of Oakland. .
The estate left by the pioneer capital
! ist is in excellent condition. It -consists
j of more than $300,000 in cash in banks.
, About 1200.000 of that Is on deposit in the
! East, and Si. JO ,000 represents coin deposits
i in San Francisco. The remainder of the
! estate is in stocks and bonds, and some
I real estate in San Francisco.
A large number of bequests, ranging
| from 53CO to $l'J00, are made to many
: nieces and nephews.
By the codicil E. May Cogswell and
i Florence Cogswell, nieces, are cut out of
i a bequest of 275 shares of the Oceanic
I Steamship Â¦ Company stock devised to
! them in the oriKinal will. A bequest of
i $2<XiO to Professor E. O. Jameson of Bos
! ton. Mass., is also revoked, no reason be
ing assigned in either case.
Mrs. Marion Stevens, a niece, of San
Francisco, and Don Alvaro Skellinger, a
nephew, of Santa Monica, are omitted
from mention.
In anticiration^of any possible contest
of any provision's of his will, Dr. Cogs
well placed the fallowing paragraph in it:
If any one or more of the persons mentioned
i and referred to in this, my will, contests or
enters into any litigation with respect to my
will, or any of the provisions of the same, or
in anv court attempts to vacatp or set aside

shall I* treated as lapsed legacies and shall
revert to my estate.
While there is no intimation as yet of
contests, it is evident from the ironclad
! terms of this clause that the aged doctor

cided that an organization should be ef
fected. It was also settled that Dr. Hen

Later Dr. Gardner was ushered in and
introduced to the new board.

The complexion of the board now being
Republican 'in politics, there is much
speculation as to whether any of the of
ficial heads will fall in the near future
In a statement to The Call correspondent
one of the managers said that there would
be some changes made in the near future*
that the board was an administration
board, and proposed to work harmonious
ly and for the best interests of the insti
tution; that any changes that would be
made would not be for the personal ad
vancement of any of the managers; that
there would bÂ« no fnction between the
board and the medical superintendent
and that no appointments would be made
at present except at the request of the
Governor.
It may be that Governor Gage will at
the proper time recommend changes ,as

NEW YORK, July 28.â General Leonard
Wood, Military Governor of Cuba, who
has been in the United States for
about a fortnight, sailed on the Mex

said of the military' status In Cuba:
"The withdrawal of United States
troops from Cuba will end with the em
barkation of the remaining battalions of
the First and Fifth regiments. That will
leave only about 5000 soldiers on the
islandâ merely enough for garrison duty.
"Fears that yellow fever would inter
fere with the transfer of the First In

ceipt of a telegram 'which said that the
surgeons reported that all signs of it had
disappeared, and that the embarkation
would proceed with all possible dispatch."
WOOD SAZLS FOR CUBA-
Former Director General of Posts in
Cuba Charged With Misappro
priating' Funds.
HAVANA, July 2S.â Estes G. Rathbone,
recently Director General of Posts in
Cuba, was arrested at 11 o'clock to-day on
four charges. These allege the unlawful
drawing of two orders for $500 each, pay
ing his private coachman and gardener
from the postal funds and drawing per
diem allowance when not entitled to do
so. Mr. Rathbone was held in bonds of
$25,000.
He remained in the courtroom all day
awaiting the decision of the Judge in the
matter of acceptance of Francisco Gamba,
one of the richest Spanish merchants of
Havana, as bondsman for $25,000. Rath
bone was obliged to go to the guardhouse
to-night because the Judge ruled that
Gamba could not go on the bond without
the consent of his business partner.
Mr. Rathbone's lawyers say the bond Is
unreasonable, as the total amount of
fraud alleged is not over $4000.
Four charges were filed against Rath
bone. One based on each of the $200 war
rants alleged to have been converted to
his personal use and no vouchers offered:
third, on the allegation that he paid his
coachman, footman and gardener from
the postal funds; fourth, on the alleged
taking of $5 per diem without authority.

the man to take his picture and OelrichB
scolded him severely. The man's manner
was not at all apologetic and Oelrichs,
growing more exasperated every minute,
finally kicked the camera out of Its own

The man cried at the loss of his $35
camera .and left the scene vowing: he
would sue Oelrichs.
NEWPORT. July 2S.-Newport Casino

ROME. July 2S.â Friction ha? arisen be

ere proceeding secretly between the Amer
ican authorities in Manila and the insur
gent chiefs in the course of which the de
mand of the latter that the present Span

Philippines and property confiscated has
rot been rejected with indignation. Sev

VATICAN OBJECTS TO
GOVERNMENT'S ATTITUDE
General Otis said: "Major Goodwin
I? in command at, Oayagan, where the
eigrhty-r.ine Filipinos are said to have
been killed, and ] am certain that no such
action was taken on his part without
ccuse. Alvarez is a murderer who has
been making things uncomfortable for us
ever since we landed in the island and
a!.<v> has been robbing- the natives until
they asked the aid of our troops all alonsr
the northern coast of the island. His
band of marauders are located In the
TiPiKhborhood of Cayagan and have been
making raids continually. They succeed
ed in entering 1 the town at one time and
Â¦were driven out by our tropps. It was
probably his men who were, implicated in
the murder. Major Goodwin is a thor
oughly reliable officer, and you may be
frure that he would not have attacked and
Hi led that number of natives if they were
not under arms.
"There has not been a sinsrle case of an
execution of natives for the murder of
Americans."
NEW YORK. July 2S.â A special to the
"U'orld from Rochester says: General El
well S. Otis to-day discussed the cable
dispatch received from Manila Thursday
Â¦Which stated that a soldier was murdered
yesterday in a native store at Oriqueta.
Northern Mindanao, on Thursday while
purchasing snme food and that a company
of the Fortieth Infantry, stationed at
Cayapan. immediately went to Oriqueta
and killed eighty-nine natives as an act
of reveng-e.

ACTION WAS JUSTIFIABLE
Those who are familiar with the coun
try say Ajruincldo ccukl have snupht no
more <eeurv position. The approaches to
his hiding placo involve a great deal of
climbing. It :s a desolate region, and it is
taid the cfSoers who served in the Dakota
Bad Lands will find much in common in
the Corona Mountains. It is supposed
Apuinaldo will make his final stand there.
The signature is evidently that of Cap

legislators feared an edverse decision on
any primary law under the present con
stitutional limitations. If the amendment
is carried in November the next Legisla
ture will be in a position to give us a
new and efficient primary law that will
bland the tests of the courts."
Chairman nouvier's Idea.
The news of the decision did not find
the Republican county Central Commit
tee unprepared. Ever since the case was
submitted to the Supreme Court prepara
tions have been on foot for such an emer
gency.
"\\ e are the governing body of the Re
publican party ir: San Francisco," Chair
man Eouvier said last night, "and we will
proceed with preparations for holding a
convention for the nomination of munici
pal officers, with the Stratton law elim
inated.
"A majority of the members of the
County Central Committee were in the
rooms in the course of this afternoon and
to-night. The opinion generally held was
that the municipal convention should be
held about the time it would have been
held had the Stratton law primary been
followed. There was no discussion as to
the date to be set for a Republican pri
mary. That will have to be decided in
committee meeting."

ASSESSMENT ROLLS OF

ASSESSOR DODGE sent his annual report to Mayor Pheian yesterday, in
which he submits tables covering two yeara of his administration. 1S0D ar.it
1900, and one of hi3 prpdecessor's. H08. The large Increase in the assess
ment roll has been mainly on personal property. The falling oÂ«T in the roll
in 1000 is due, the Assessor claims, to a decision of the Supreme Court in
April, 1900, declaring bonds of California corporations non-taxable. Thia decision
struck off J19.OCHi.000 of assessable property from the roll of 1&00. which wa-Â» nearly

slightest degree question the wisdom and
integrity of the court.
Lawyers of both parties assert that the
decision of the court declaring the pri
mary law void will not affect the provi
sion of law which requires new registra
tion throughout the State for the gen
eral election next November. In the con
fuRlon voters should not overlook the
duty of registering for the Presidential
election.
In the work of framing the primary
election law and the subsequent efforts
put forward by the people of both parties
to meet its requirements a vast deal of
labor and large aums of money have been
expended. All of this is love's labor lost
and money thrown away. Jacob btep
pacher's work of years has gone up.
The non-partisans, such as George K.
Fitch J. N. Britton and others, will re
joice that the law has been overthrown.
They regarded the act as the device of
bosses to exclude independent citizens
from participation in the nominating con
ventions. The- non-partisans can now or
ganize to defeat the boss nominations of
either political party.
SENATOR STRATTON'S OPINION.
Matters Now Same as Before Bill
Was Passed and Porter Law
Operative.
Senator Stratton said regarding the de
cision when seen at his home in Oakland:
"The Supreme Court's decision leaves
primary election matters exactly as they
existed before the passage of the late
law. We exist now under the same legal
conditions as to primaries which have
prevailed since 1S67, when the Porter pri
mary law was enacted. That law is now
in full force and effect.
"This, however, in small comfort for
the reason that when party committees
appoint their own officers and manage
their own primaries the result is deter
mined before a ballot is cast.
"Tho Porter primary law, permitting
political parties to manage without let or
hindrance their own primary elections,
is a part of the political code of this State.
It was repealed by the primary election
law of 1S&5. This repealing act was held
unconstitutional and subsequent appeals
were attempted in the primary election
laws of 1U97 and 1S99. Sinc<? all these laws
have been declared unconstitutional the
attempted repeals of the Porter law fall
also to the ground.
"Under the Porter law each party com
mittee can impose Its own test as to the
right to participate In any primary elec
tion. Since the Supreme Court has de
termined that no one can be prosecuted
for perjury in connection with such a test
this only operates as a moral deterrent.
"I am exceedingly optimistic in the be
lief that the present state of things will
not be permitted to continue in this
State. While the work has been laborious
and thus far all efforts to better political
methods through legislation have proved
invalid, still the time and the effort have
not been lost. I am satisfied that those
who have been the pioneers in advancing
this great reform will in the end achieve
success. The difficulties have always been
known and the legal objections have been
clearly foreseen.
"I myself introduced at the last session
of the Legislature a proposed constitution
al amendment which will permit the Leg
islature to pass a proper primary eleqtion
law. This proposed amendment nassed
both house? and will be voted upon by the
people at the next general election. The
present law was defective only in part. If
the constitution is changed as suggested,
this law can be amended in important
particulars and placed anew upon the
statute books.
"The absolutely necessary feature of
any primary election law is that it must
be under State control. . The primai-len
must further be held at the same time
and place for all .parties respectively.
Such a law must further be simple in its
operations and inexpensive in its work
ings. Each party should have the right
to determine who constitutes its members
and who are therefore entitled to partici
pate in its primaries.
"The late law had all of these elements
except the last, and this can be added
when the constitution is amended.
"The rural districts do not need a pri
mary law, and it should only be manda
tory in cities. This also is embodied in
the proposed constitutional amendment."
What Assemblyman Dibble Says.
Henry C. Dibble. Assemblyman from the
Forty-first District, who made the tight
for the Stratton act in the Assembly,
calls attention to the fact that by an
amendment to section 11S6 of the Political
Code, passed by the last Legislature, pri
maries of. the old sort will be necessary.
"It will not be possible." Judge Dibble
said yesterday, "for delegates to be ap
pointed The amendment to section 1186
is not Involved In the Supreme Court de
cision and is, in my opinion, still in force.
This section defines a convention as 'an
assemblage of delegates elected by bal
lot at a primary election, representing a
political party," etc. Previously a con
vention was simply an "organized assem
blage of delegates representing a political
party.' The existing ballot laws provide
that party nominations must be made by
conventions and I conclude therefore that
the only way that candidates can be
placed on the ticket la for them to be
chosen at conventions composed of dele
gates elected at primaries. Appointed del
egates would not constitute a convention
under the provisions of the new amend
ment.
"I regret very mucn that the Stratton
primary law has been declared unconsti
tutional. We are left without any real
legal protection against frauds at pri
maries* As it now stands everything de
pends upon fair dealing by the party man
agers. If honest primary election officers
are appointed and the people lake enough
interest to turn out and see that there
is no stuffing and that an honest cuunt
is had all .will be well.
"As I understand it the old Porter pri
mary law has not been specifically re
perflcd. It provides thnt by resolution of
the controlling committee a party may
hold Its primafy under the sanction of the
laws governing elections and makes the
penalties against infractions of the gen
eral election laws applicable in such cases.
Direct reference is made in the act to
come forty sections of the Political Code.
Many of these have been abrogated by the
new ballot laws, so that the act has little
substance left. , It never amounted to
much, anyway, as there were never any
prosecutions under It.
"Thoughtful politicians hoped that the
Stratton act would be sustained. It made
decent politics necessary. Now many a
boss will be drawn to corrupt methods
In order to win who would have preferred
to make his fight along decent lines, as he
would have had to do under the Stratton
law. ...
"By Senate constitutional amendment
No. 4, which, will be voted on by the people
in November, authority Is given the Leg
islature to enact laws relative to the
holding of primaries and to provide tests
and conditions under which electors and
political parties may participate. This
amendment was submitted because tho
"I would like to talk with our friends
of the other side, as Republicans and
Democrats face the same situation, and in
my judgment there should be some uni
form plan of action, as there is no law
governing the, case. AVe are in the same
boat through no fault of either party. At
this time 1 cannot speak as to the wishes
of our own committee. Personally I am
in favor of holding our State Convention
at Santa Cruz on August 2S, the time and
place which we designated when we were
supposed to be governed by the primary
law. I would have the primary election
for delegates held on August 14, as we
contemplated, and I would not change the
apportionment. At present we are all at
sea The lawyers have not told us how
much, if any. of the old primary law re
mains. In fact, we may have nothing ro
fall back on but old-time party usage.
Our executive committee may decide to
recommend to the county committees
some plan of selecting or electing dele
gates to the State, Congressional and local
conventions."
The chairman of the general committee.
Colonel George Stone, said the decision of
the court came as a great surprise. He
said:
Immediately after the receipt of. the
news George Stone, chairman, and Wil
liam M. Cutter, secretary of the Republi
can State Central Committee, sent for
W. Â£>._ Wood, chairman of the legal com
mittee. The result of a brief conference
was a decision to call a meeting of the
executive committee. Accordingly notices
were sent by mall and wire summoning
all the members of the committee, to con
vene at party headquarters, in the Palace
Hotel, at 4 p. m. to-morrow. No plan of
future action will be devised until the
subject is thoroughly discussed with the
lawyers.'
The decision of the State Supreme Court
declaring the' new primary election law
void created a profound sensation In po
litical circles. The news spread rapidly
from one party camp to another. There
were secret whisperings all day Friday
that the court might render such a de
cision, but after all the shock came to the
majority of party leaders without premo
nition.
OPINIONS OF
THE LEADERS
ON DECISION
It may be further suggested that under the
present law, the ballot being entirely secret.
and every voter belnc allowed to cast his vote
for the delegates of any party represented
upon the ballet, the result Is that Democratic
voters may elect delegates to Republican con
ventions and Republican voters may elect dele
gntes to Democratic conventions, anÂ«l thereby
absolutely own and control the conventions of
opposing political parties. I am not prepared
to say that this existence of these conditions
clearly renders a law unconstitutional which
permits It. But I am prepared to eay that a
law of that character presents a most anomal
ous state of affairs. And a remedy for the evil
should be found at the first session of the
Legislature. GAROUTTE, J.
Political Trickery Suggested.
Frr these reasons I do not deem the 3 per
cent ciause of the primary election law ob
noxious to ilie constitution of this State. It
may â¢Â»),? further suggested that, Â«s the Austra
lian ballot law does not recrgnlze an organiza
tion as a party which failed to poll 3 per eent
of the total vote cast at the last election, no
j-ul>ttant:al benefits could be derived by such a
party In participating in primary election*..
for the nominee of a convention coip?3setl of
delegate! selected at tho primary election by
such party would net be entitled to a place
upon the ballots. It must be borne In mind
that the rrlrnary law in this regard is not
doilinff with voters ns individuals, but with
political parties as sueh.
the primary law refers' to n great class of po
litical parties. And if that class of political
parties declared and recognized by the Austra
lian ballot law forms a constitutional class
then the primary law, in dealing with the same
clas* of i>"liticÂ«l parties, is likewise constitu
tional. While the question has never been de
cided in this State, it has been decided in other
State?, and he- Id that a clarification of parties
upon the basis of a certain percentase of the
total vote cast at the last election Is not viola
tive of constitutional provisions. Indeed, it
seems to me that the decinrallon of the State
found in the Australian ballot law 85 to what
shall constitute a political party within the
meaning of that act is constitutional legisla
tion.
Porter Primary
Law Prevails,
Declare Party
Leaders.
t-~, r-^iiir.. Mraunn r"*irnary olcctlnn law
has been declared unconstitutional
and void by the Supreme Court. A
ii decision to this effect was handed
down yesterday noon. The prevail
ing opinion w<is written hy Justice HÂ«
*haT\- and concurred in by Justices Harri
son. Van Dyke, McFarlar.d and TV-m^Ie
tiie la^t named writing a separate opin
ion. Chief Justice Beatty dissented, but
without comment. Justice CJaroutte also
dissented and wrote his reason for so iij
in<r. In brief, the case was this:
The Election Commissioners and other
ciyr officials were proceeding with the
â¢UAjrk of preparation for the fall primary
fV-ctions ur.iic-r the Stratton law. Jost-ph
[Britton; president of the Beard of Free
holders v.tich framed the charter, took
legaJ eteps to enjoin the Klection Com
missioners from j-roct'ediri* with the elec
tion ar.d to prevent the expenditure of
money necessary therefor. His ground oi
attack wai that the primary law was in
â¢violation of the constitution;
The Election Commission i demurred to
the complaint,; end in order that the mat
ter might be the sooner decided by the
Supreme Court. Superior Judge Seawell
sustained the demurrer.
The higher tourt in overruling Judge
Seawell ar.d deciding i:i favor of Mr. Brit
ton's i>osition holds that a law making i
X-cr cent necessary for party representa
tion on the ballot Is discriminatory and
unjust. Small political partiesâ those
â¢which did not poll the required 3 per cent
*jt all votes cast, and those which might
come into exigenceâ have the same rights
end privileges aÂ«i parties of greater nu
merical strength, the Supreme Court says.
ThÂ«- Legislature, the court lontinues. ex
ce^ed its power when it attempted to put
regulations anJ restrictions upon dtixens
by d:ctaiii:p how they should make their
selections of delegates to conventions.
>'urthÂ«jrnv>re, the law was an unwarrant
ed invasion of the rights of political par-
Ties. The Justices say also lhat the
"deprivation of the right of selection is
the deprivation of the right of franchise."
Justice Garoutte in his dlssentine opin
ion states that in the Australian ballot
law is found a oeclaratiou as to what con
stitutes political parties that are entitled
to huld political convention* ana nominate
candidates for Office. He does not deem
the 3 per cent clause in the primary law
as obnoxious tt> the constitution of this

Three Per Cent Provision.
But here we are confronted with a provision
in th's law denying its rirlits and privileges
to aJl jÂ«>litical parties which did not cyst at
tha next preceding election at least 3 per cent
of the total vote. In other words, no matter
how wpII organized a i>oliti(.al party may b<r.
no matter how devoted its adherents may be to
its tenet.", they are denied a representation upon
ihe primary Uillot, cut off from all beneiits
of the law, prohibited from holding a nominat
ing convention < because only under the pro
visions Of this law can suoh a convention be
held), and are thus absolutely debarred from
th<_- privileges and protections accorded to other
political parties. This is not the case where
the State as matter Of regulation when called
upon to print ballots at public expense re
stricts the names to be printed thereon.lo the
parties polling a certain percentage of the
votts. Even upon this question there has been
a division in' the courts, s.^nie holding it to bÂ».
a mere matter of rtgulation and not an in
terference with the right of suffrage and other
wise maintaining that it confers a special
privilege upon the stronger of the political
parties. Even where such laws have been
ujheld the right of the voter to freely express
liis preference has always been preserved and
in this State by blank spaces wherein he may
write the names of the candidates of his
chuice. This law contains no such provision.
Minor political parties are denied any right
of r< presentation upon the ballot and are ;:i
effect forbidden to hold political conventlors
under the protection of the law. It is nu
snswf r to this to say that they may Ftiil cause
the nanus of their nominees to be placed upun
the election ballot by petition. The objection
is not that they may not in some way pre
serve this essential right, but that they ate
denied the right to accomplish this result by
the holding of a convention, that they are
denied the right freely to ars^mble under the
prelection of the law, a right preserved in
them froth by the constitution of the United
States and of the State of California, whiie
ether political parties' no differently situated
saving that they are numerically stronger are
given ih.s right and protected by all of the
machinery of the law in its exercise.
Political conventions are after all but public
assemblages of the people, having for their
end the discussion of ways and means for the
IHiblic good. Hy the declaration of rights of
the constitution of this State the people have
the right to freely assemble together to con
sult for the common gi>od, to instruct their rep
resentatives and to petition the Legislature for
redress of grievances. (Art. 1, Sec. 10.) No
citizens or class of citizens shall be granted
privileges or immur'ties which upon the same
terms shall not be granted to other citizens
(Pec. 21), and all laws of a general nature shall
have a uniform iperation (Sec. 11). How can
it be said that a law which protects by legis
lation a certain number of citizens forming
one political party and deprives a fewer num
ber of citizens forming another political party
(if the same protection is not violative of these
provisions? Or how yhall it be said that a man
belonging to a party holding certain political
principles may not participate in a primary
election when his neighbor of different political
faith !s accorded the right so to do?
Limitation Is Unreasonable.
Moreover, if the Legislature may deny the
protection of its lÂ«ws to a political party which
has ca?t lers than 3 per cent of the votes,
why may it not deny the same right to a party
which has cast 4S per cent of the votes? This
is not a mere matter of regulation, as in the
case of the election ballot. It is the depriva
tion of th<- one party and the conferring upon
tnuihrr of certain important political rights,
and answer to it cannot be made by &ayiÂ°hg
that the 3 per cent limit is reasonable while
a 4S per cent limitation would be un
reasonable. It is a question of power. Either
the Legislature has or has not the power bo
to do. If it has the power the question of
reasonableness or unreasonabless Is for the
Legislature alcne. and a court would not more
be Justified in overthrowing the law because
it believed a 4'J per cent limitation to be un
reasonable than in the absence of Euch power
it would be warranted in upholding a 3 per
cent limitation because it might believe it to
l# reasonable. And upon this we think that
under the fxprefs limitations upon the power
of the Le-rislature in the sections of the con
stitution above Pdvierted to the Legislature
hhf not such power. For the effect of its act
here under consideration is not only to discrim
inate between political parties and the mem
bers thereof, but absolutely to work the dis
iranchisement of voters, or to compel them,
if they v.jte at all, to vote for representatives
<f i-jlltical parties other than that to which
they bolong. The deprivation of the right of
selection is a deprivation of the right of fran
chise.
May Freely Assemble.
It is further contended against this law that
lr. its present state it works an unwarranted
Invasion of the rights of political parties and
this contention merits mere than a passing no
tice. No one can be so ignorant as not to ap
preciate- the value, indeed the necessity of on
peeing political parties in a Government such
as our?. No one, it would seem can be so
thoughtle^ .if not to realize lhat government
by the people ie a progressive institution which
seeks to give expression and effect to the
wisest and best ideas of its meml^rs. No ex
j.reFslon is needed In the declaration of rights
to the effect that electors holding certain po
litical principles in common may freely asuem
1-le. organize themselves into a political party
and use all legitimate meas:Â« to carrv their
principles of government into active operations

In the Australian ballot law a declaration Is
found defining what constitutes a political party
within the purview of the act; and then It Is
further declared that those parties are entitled
to hold political conventions and nominate can
didates for office. The .vital element going to
make up a political party under that act is
that it shall have polled 3 per cent of the
entire vote caÂ»t at the last election: The pri
mary la w doe3 not a" em Pt t0 define the phrase
â¢'political' parties," but , declare* that only
those political parties which polled 3 per
cent of the total vote cast at the laat election
shall participate in primary elections. In other
words, this is a declaration that only those po.
Utlcal' parties which are entitled to hold con
ventions and nominate candidates for office
Milder the Australian ballot law are entitled to
hold primary elections. It Is thus apparent that
In his dissenting opinion the Justice who
disagrees with his colleagues says:
Dissenting Opinion.
I concur in the judgment on the second
ground discussed by Mr. Justice Henshaw, and
lor the following additional reasons:
The act 1eeognl2.es the necessity cf political
parties and they are in fact thj instrumentali
ties through which the reon'e govern. A poli
tical party is an association ot citizens who
agree r.n certain lines of policy, and the pur
pose for which It exists Is to Impose that pol
icy upon the govtrnrr.er.t. This can only be
done by electing to office those who are in fa
vor of such policy. It Is for this that conven
tions are held and candidates selected. To do
thin it Is absolutely necessary that the party
shall be able to exclude from its conventions
and from controlling positions In the party
tho*Â» who are not in accord with its principles.
It must have the power to prescribe Its own
tests- It is the test that determines what the
party Khali be. To deprive that party of thin
power is to destroy it. No ona would contend
that the I>>f,-ltlature can prescribe what the
test ?hall l>e. If it could do this it could pre
scribe what parties shall exist. And then, par
ties sometimes divide on . great public ques
tions In *uch case the party retaining the old
name would liave the right, by proper tests, to
exclude Hies* formerly affiliated with it but
who now dlfTer. Unless a party can do all
thi>'.e things It hns no security that the candi
dates put forth In its name- represent it* prin
ciples And then the management and control
of its" organization may be taken, out of Its
hantfs and glv^n to its enemies. All this right
of self-control the primary election law takes
from the party organization. The party is de
stroyed, or may 1*-. and the members practi
cally denied the right of free iiurfras**.
And then thÂ«re may happen to be a new party
which did not exist nt the previous election.
Why should It, or. indeed, other political par
ties colling less than three per cent of the
votes be denied the benefit of the protection of
this lawâIf it be a protection ? TEMpLE }
I concur In the above '.
Justice Temple's concurring opinion is
as follows: .
Justice Temple Goes Further.
For the foregoing reasons the Judgment of
the trial court is reversed, with directions that
it overrule the demurrer of defendants.
HENSHAW. Judge.
We concur: Van Dyke, Judge; McKarland,
Judge. I dlcBÂ»nt: Beatty, Chief Justice.
. A law which will destroy such party or
ganization or permit it fraudulently to pass
into the hands of its political enemies cannot
be upheld. The procedure of political .parties
may be regulated and the wisdom of the Leg
islature may well be exercised in' devising
methods to check political corruption and
fraud, but 'the Legislature Itself," under the
guise of regulation, cannot be permitted to
throw open the doors to thece very abuses.
A law authorizing or even permitting the op
ponent* of an organized -political pa>ty to
namp the delegates to the nominating conven
tion of that party would not for a moment be
countenanced. Yet that in effect is precisely
what the act under consideration does permit.
It provides that the primary election of all
political parties shall be held at the same time.
To the intending voter at such primary om>
ticket is given. No question may be permitt'.-l
touching his political affiliation, past, present
or future. The voter -takes the tickPt. retires
Into the privacy of the booth and there, seatÂ»d
âand not in violation of any law, but In strict
accordance with the law â names such dele
gates as he desires td the political convention
of one or another of the parties, whether he 1*
a member of that party or not, whether he
ever intends to become such a member or not.
The result Is apparent. ; The contr"! of the
party and of ltÂ« affairs, the promulgation and
advocacy of Its principles, are taken from the
hands cf its honest members and turned over
to the venal and corrupt of other political par
ties, or of none at all. Masquerading thJS
under the name of one of the great political
parties might be a convention or men author
ized by this law to represent It and place upon
the general election ballot as its candidate
those whom they might selectâ a body of men
whose sole purpose might be the disruption
and destruction of the party whose representa
tives this law declared them to b<*. It is ex
pressly declared In the declaration of rights
that the enumeration therein contained shall
net be construed to impair or deny others re
tained by the-people. (Art. I. Sec. -23.) A law
which thus permits the disruption and mis
representation of a political party is an in
novation of these reserved rights.
"The purpo.es f'^r which men enter Into so
ciety will determine the nature and terms of
the compact: and as they are the foundation
of the legislative power, they will deride what
ere the proper objects of it. The nature and
ends of legislative power will limit the exer
cise of it. This fundamental principle flows
from the very nature of our free, republican
governments, that no man should be compelled
to rirt what the laws do not require, nor to re
frain from acts which the Jaws permit. There
are acts which the Federal or State Legisla
ture cannot do without exceeding their au
thority. There are certain vital principles in
our fre<Â» American republican scovernments
which will determine and overrule an appar
ent and flagrant abuse of legislative power: as
to authorize manifest Injustice, by positive
law; or to take away that security for personal
liberty, or private property, for the protection
whereof the government is established. An act
of the Legislature (for I cannot call it a law)
contrary to the first great principles of the so
cial compact, cannot be considered a rightful
exprclse of legislative authority." And in Loan
Association vs. Topeka; 2<> Wall.. 66.1, that same
tribunal declared: "It must be conceded that
there are such rights in every free govern
ment beyond the control of the State. â¢ â¢ â¢
There are limitations on such power which
grow out of the essential nature of all free
governments'â Implied reservations of individual
rights, without which the social compact could
not exist, and which are respected by all gov
ernments entitled to the name." Active politi
cal parties, parties in opposition to the dom
inant political party are. as has been said, es
sential to the very existence of our govern
ment. The rljiht of any number of men hold
ing common political beliefs or governmental
principles to advocate their views through
party organization cannot be denied. As has
been said: "Self-preservation Is an Inherent
rljrfct of political partien as well as of Indi

SUPREME COURT PRONOUNCES THE STRATTON
PRIMARY LAW TO BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALIi, SUNDAY, JULY 29, 1900.
A. i Camjnettl of Amador Is Inclined to
believe that the decision is a misfortune
to the State, although he does not In the
Senator J. C. Sims, chairman of the
Democratic State Central Committee, was
preparing to leave the city for Santa
Rosa when he heard of the decision. He
said the committee would not- take any
line of action until the lawyers were
consulted. Personally he was in favor
of primaries, according to old forms of
party usage. He was of the opinion that
Democratic sentiment generally preferred
primaries rather -than the system of ap
pointing delegates. He remarked that a
meeting of the executive committee
would be held next Saturday. Chairman
Sims is In favor of holding the State Con
vention at San Jose, the place designated
by the State Central Committee.
T. O. Toland of Ventura, who .was yes
terday chosen chairman of the executive
committee to fill the vacancy caused- by
the resignation of R. M. Fitzgerald, -read
the court decision to a throng of Demo
crats at headQuarters. The concurring
and dissenting opinions were discussed.
Lawyers Will Be Consulted.
Senator Cutter, secretary of the commit
tee, and one who served in the last Legis
lature, was surprised, but not over
whelmed with astonishment. He expressed
the opinion that the old Porter law which
afforded a plan of electing delegates to
nominating conventions was knocked out
by the amendments to the Political Code
which were made to smooth the way for
the Stratton law. He remarked that the
Australian ballot law stood, but nothing
remained to govern primaries. He fancied
that unregistered persons could be pre
vented from participating In the open, ko
as you please primaries by the adoption
of a test, "Are you registered?" Each
political party could, in his judgment,
submit any form of test agreed upon.
Secretary Cutter said he would not
change the date or plaoe of holding the
State Convention, or for that matter
change the apportionment. He was of the
opinion that county committees through
out the State would settle the manner of
selecting delegates according to the
wishes of their respective localities. Of
course the conventions could not exclude
proxies. He realized that all the State
Central Committee -could do was advise
county committees, and the latter could
appoint delegates or select their repre
sentatives by primary election or mass
meeting. . . . ..-._.
A Call representative conveyed to M.
F. Tarpey. Democratic National Commit
tfeman, the first news of the Supreme
Court decision. Mr. Tarpey instantly went
to Democratic headquarters at the Cali
fornia Hotel to discuss the situation with
Chairman J. C. Sims.,. It was the Judg
ment of tho national commlttceman that
measures should be taken at once to get
the best legal advice on the subject. Â¦ In
view of all the conditions and the fact
that the decision affected both political
parties in the same manner he believed it
advisable that a joint conference of Re
publican and Democratic leaders should
be called.

Soon a number of the soldiers and
marines began to get hilarious and then
the police "smelt a rat." They secured
one of Henry Peterson's boats and made
a search under the wharf, but the whisky
traders saw them getting into the boat
and easily made their escape. No more
liquor got on the wharf by that route.
Many of tho men attempted to take
large bottles of whisky aboard the trans
port, but in every instance it was taken
from them by the officer on watch and
smashed against the. side of the ship.
The next transports to get away for
China will be the Meade from this port
and the Garonne from Seattle. Both ves
sels leave on Wednesday, August 1. The
Meade Is to take away one battalion of
the Fifteenth Infantry, one squadron at
the Third Cavalry and one company'of
engineers; in all sixty officers and 1071
men. The Garonne takes away two squad
rons of the First Cavalry and 100 recruits;

There were many bitter partings
when the hour for sailing came
along and then as the minutes
passed and there was no sign of the
big transport getting away the women
took heart of grace and began to smile
again.
Some wily waterfront rats hit on a great
scheme to make money and did a land
office business in flasks of whisky until
the police found them out. They secured
a Whitehall, loaded her with the whisky,
and getting under the wharf passed up
twenty-five cent flasks, charging fifty
cents for them, as fast as they could be
handled.
When the Navy Department determined
to enlist a battalion of marines the com
mand was given to Major Randolph Dick
ins. The major is well known in San
Francisco and a host of â¢ friends were
down to wish him godspeed yesterday. He
was here for some time as captain of ma
rines on the Philadelphia, but shortly be
fore the war \Vas transferred to the Or
egon and accompanied that vessel on her
famous run around the Horn to Cuba, He
eerved throughout the Spanish war on the
battleship and at its conclusion was pro
moted to be a major and placed. in com
mand of the barracks at the Washington
Navy-yard.
Company A of the battalion Is officered
by Captain McKelvey and Lieutenants
Mathews and Baxtrom. It was recruited in
New York. Captain Dutton is in eom~
mand of Company B. He is the son of W.
J. Dutton of this city and has served In
Manila. Company C was recruited at
Charleston navy yard, Boston. Its offi
cers are Captain Moses and Lieutenants
McDougald and Taylor. Lieutenant Hirsh
lnger of Mare Island accompanies the bat
talion as adjutant.
Lieutenant Colonel John H. Calef was to
have gone out in command of the four
batteries of the Third Artillery, but he did
not get here in time, so Captain Charles
Humphreys went out in command of tho
battalion.
The complete list of those who will sail
on the Hancock Is as follows: Batteries
A, D, I and O of the Third Artillery;
Companies A, B, C and D of marines;
Major Hugh Gallagher and four clerks;
eighteen officers of the Marine Corps;
seventeen privates of the Hospital Corps;
Â¦nine men of the Signal Corps; ten recruits
for Light Battery F, Fifth Artillery; sev
en recruits for the Ninth Infantry and ten
nurses.
Off for the Front.
When the marines reached the transport
wharf they were greeted with ringing
cheers by the men oÂ£ Batteries A. D, I
and 0 of the Third Artillery, which pre
ceded them an the Hancock. The Third
Artillery band was also there and playe^l
familiar airs throughout the day. The
favorite with all hands was "There'll Be
a Hot Time." The band does not accom
pany the regiment, but the men went to
the wharf in a body to bid their comrades
good-by.
It is many a long day since San Fran
cisco eaw such a gathering of marines as
paraded along East street yesterday. They
came 500 strong from the recruiting' sta
tions at New \ork, Annapolis, Washing
ton and Boston and are a very fine body
of men. It required two trips of the
Ocean Wave to bring them from Point
Richmond to San Francisco. Companies
A and C came over on the 8 a. m. trip,
while Companies B and D reached this

A Reasonable Proposition.
SOLDIERS AND SAILORS OFF
FOR SEAT OF WAR IN CHINA
There has been considerable curiosity as
to how the parade reports of the First In
fantry of the National Guard of California
will show up when they reach headquar
ters. At headquarters no one as yet seems
to know what they look like or If any one
does the fact is concealed from the pub
lic, for when inquiry is made as to news
of the guard the answer is, "There la
nothing new."
It. is known outside of official sources
that a number of the companies of that
regiment did not parade on the Fourth or
July In the numbers that the law requires.
The law is that when, companies are or
dered out for parade if any parade less
than thirty-two men it shall be disband
ed Some of the companies made such a
meager showing that they had to be con
solidated with the result that there was
not a full regiment on parade. One of
the companies did not have more than ten
men for parade. An officer of the com
pany, when asked how he would get over
the thirty-two or disband proposition, re
plied:
"That's easy enough. The men reported
at the armoryâ more than forty of them.â
but we did not have any uniforms t?r
them so they could not parade. We man
aged to scrape up a few presentable uni
forms and consolidated our men with oth
er companies that were shy on uniforms.
The men answered rollcall and that is
equivalent to parading In view of the fact
that they could not be in line in the. habili
ments of soldiers." . . :
The reply of the 'officer as to the uni
forms for the First Infantry Is true. It
Is now several months since the measures
for the men were given, but the uniforms
have not materialized. If this continues
it Is likely that the First Regiment will
not be in better condition, to parade on
Admission day than it was on the Fourth
of July.
"The lack of promptitude in placing the
guard on the footing 10 make It the ef
fective body that the taxpayers expect it
should be," said a disgusted guardsman
yesterday, "has had a demoralizing effect
on the men, who now do not seem to care
if they ever receive uniforms or if the
guard is equipped."
Colonel J. F. BÂ«rgin, having- been placed
on the retired list, bas been detailed to-re
port to the brigadier general of the Sec
ond Brigade. He will act as assistant
adjutant general, to succeed Giesting
with rank of lieutenant colonel. When he
was selected for that position he would,
if he had accepted it at once, been re
duced from colonel to the lower grade.
In order not to lose his rank, having
served long enough, he asked'to be placed
on the retired Hat; It was a neat little
scheme and it worked to the satisfaction
of Colonel Burgin.
The long talked of changes on the staff
of the commander in chief have been
made. Wlnslow Anderson is made sur
geon general, vice Hopkins; F. E. Beck
paymaster, vice Chadbourne: Robert J.
Northram aid, vice Gasson; James B.
Lankershlm. vice Ogden: Samuel J. Hen
dy aid, vice P. L. Bu?h. The others on the
staff remain undisturbed.

CONTRACTOR AGREES
TO BE INCARCERATED
( he realized that the interests of the San
j Francisco archdiocese demanded his pres
i ence and interest. He determined to re
turn, therefore, but he decided also that he
must receive a coadjutor. This is the
! reason for the appointment of Bishop
i Montgomery to the high position which
â¢ he will soon occupy.
Bishop Montgomery's Serious Duties.
It is expected that Bishop Montgomery
will be able to restore harmony wherever
friction has occurred, and it is assured
that he will carry to completion the de
signs which Archbishop Riordan has made
for the improvement of Catholic interests
in this city. While Bishop Montgomery
will control the details of management in
the archdiocese. Archbishop Riordan will
continue to ("Jrect affairs, and there is
nothing to indicate that he will not for
many years occupy the honored position
which he holds not only in San Francisco
but in the Catholic world of America. His
coadjutor necessarily receives his new
honor with the right of succession.
In connection with these important
events in the Catholic world of San Fran
cisco the life history of each man Inter
ested is of public interest.
Archbishop Riordan passsd his youth in
a seminary at Chicago. Then he went to
Rome and entered the American College.
This was In 1ZZ&. There he tpent a year
in study and another year at Paris. Then
he entered the far-famed University of
Louvain, in Belgium. While abroad the
young student acquired a thorough knowl
edge of French, German. Italian and
Flemish. In all these languages the Arch
bishop can converse quite freely. His
career as a student was brilliant. He was
ordained in the cathedral at Malines, Bel
glum, in 1S65. Later he took the degree
of licentiate of theology.
Honors for a Brilliant Cleric
On returning to America in 1S65 the
young priest was made a professor of
dogmatic theology and the Holy Scripture
In St. Mary's Seminary, Chicago. In 186S
he was appointed rector of St. Mary's
Church. Woodstock, and Jater of St.
Mary's Church. Joliet. In 1S71 he was ap
pointed to the important pastorate of St.
James Church, Chicago, where he re
mained until appointed coadjutor to the
late Archbishop Alemany, with the right
of succession.
The Archbishop's life In San Francisco
has been distinguished by the same bril
liant achievement that marked his career
as a student abroad and a priest at home.
The great cathedral on Van Ness avenue
Is an exemplification of his energy and
Christian zeal. His labors have extended
out Into many worthy channels. He
builds hospitals for the sick, homes for
the poor and asylums for the orphans.

bishop Riordan the distinction of being
c-e cf the most noted Catholic prelates
of the United States. As Father Mont
gomery, chancellor of the archdiocese of
Â£an Francisco, he held the confidence of
all classes and creeds in this city. His
Christianity was broader than his cr*ed.
He was foremost in all movements seek
ing the moral welfare of the people of the
city. He gave his energy, his ability and
his Interest to every effort which prom
ised aid to those that needed help, and it
Â¦was with sincere regret that the people of
Ban Francisco learned that he was called
to Los AXigeles. although that call meant
to Llrn new honors. It will be with sin
cere pleasure, therefore, that he will be
â¢welcomed back to this city as the assist
ant and coadjutor of Archbishop Riordan.
Archbishop Biordan's Illness.
It will be a surprise to the Catholic
people cf San Francisco that Archbishop
Riordan needs a coadjutor, as It Is not
generally known that his Grace did not
recover the health which he sought when
he left this city for Rome nearly a year
ago. When lie started on his Journey he
was physically In an unsatisfactory con
dition. For years he had labored unceas
ingly to upbuild the archdiocese over
which he has presided. He had taken an
active, personal part in every movement
which contributed to the prosperity of his
church and his people. While he had the
eatlsfaction of seeing success reward his
endeavors in many fields his health was
undermined.
Addf-d to this discouragement was the
unfortunate fact that affairs In the arch
cloeese were not being conducted as har
moniously as could be wished and Arch
* Lishop Riordan determined to combine
with his necessary visit to Rome a pur
pose to seek rest and, if possible, a re
covery of health. His long absence

A BOLD attempt was made last
Tuesday by a man known as Frank
Birtton to swindle the Columbian
Banking Company. In the Claus
Spreckels building, out of $3300 by means
of a fraudulent check. Opposed to Blrt
ton's rascality was the cleverness of F.
L. Holland, the cashier of the banking
company, who found out that the check
was spurious. Ihe Scheme failad and
Birtton hastily left the city for parts
unknown to avoid the clutches of the po
lice, who were aroused to the fact, after
Birtton had escaped, that he was a swin
dler.
Birtton, whose real name is supposed
to be Sutton, went to work about five
months ago for the People's Mineral
Hygiene Company, of which I. C. Crook
is the president and general manager. He
was at first employed in the bottling of
mineral waters at the company's works.
33 Second street. By strict attention to
business he won the confidence of Mr.
Crook and others connected with the
company. He was ingratiating and com
municative. After a while ho gave out
that he had a wealthy sister. Mrs. Daniel
H. Smith, residing in Newburgh. N. Y..
and that he expected to receive a con
siderable sum of money from her by mail.
He alÂ«o expressed a desire to Invest $1200
in the stock of the People's Mineral Hy
giene Company, a proposition which
pleaded the company.
The advance work having been per
formed, which consisted in gaining the
confidence of Mr. Crook and his asso
ciates Birtton about three weeks ago
made his flrst play for a clean-up. One
day he exhibited to his employers a let
ter postmarked Newburgh, N. Y., which
was signed "Mrs. D. H. Smith." and
which contained a check drawn on the
N-itlonal Bank of Newburgh. The fig
ures on the check were "3300." The word
ing called for the payment to Birtton of
only $3000.
Birtton pretended to be very much
disturbed by this "mistake." His employ
ers were interested in the matter because
he said that he had intended to put J1200
into the company's coffers for stock
in the concern, using the remainder to
buy a house and lot.
"Very well," Birtton said finally, "I i
suppose I will have to wait until I can j
get another check from my sister.
There did. indeed, seem to be no other !
way. This clever play had made the j
mineral water company ready for Birt
ton's third and final step. v ,_j
About a fortnight later came anothe>
letter addressed to Birtton in <Â«re of the :
People's Mineral Hygiene Company.
"Ah!" exclaimed the operator gleefully !
when he broke the envelope and ostenta
tiously pulled out the inclosed check in |
the presence of his employers. "It i^ all ;
right this time and now I can go ahead." j
Birtton then told a taking story. He I
was in haste to have the check cashed
that he might take advantage of an es
pecially fine chance to buy himself a â¢
home. in the Mission cheap. He must;
close the matter at once or lose the bar- j
gain. A member of the firm thereupon !
consented to go immediately to the Co
lumbian Banking Company to identify
him. The check that Birtton presented
to the bank teller was drawn on the Na- ;
tional Bank of Newburgh. N. Y., for i
S3200. under date cf July 19, 1000. and was i
signed "Mrs. Daniel H. Smith." The
teller passed the check up to the cashier, j
"This is a personal check." said the j
ca'shier, "and I cannot pay it until after Â¦
I have telegraphed to the bank at New- |
burgh to find out whether it is all right."
Birtton stoutly demurred. He said that
he could net wait for he would lose his
bargain. He would rather do business. If
there was to be any delay, with a friend I
of his. a "doctor." whom he expected to ]
see the next day and who had a good In
vestment for him. The representative of
the mineral water company then added
his protestations, saying that Birtton was
all right and that he had worked for the j
concern some time and they knew him I
well.
The cashier was not to be persuaded.
Soon the following dispatch was hasten
ing over the wires eastward:
SAN FRANCISCO. July 24. 1900.
To National Bank of Xewbureh. Xewburgh.
N. T.: Will you pay check Mrs. Daniel II. j
Smith on you, thirty-three hundred dollars? |
Answer quick. COLUMBIAN BANKING CO.
The answer returned was: "We have
no such account as Mrs. Daniel H.
Smith." ,
The suspicions of the cashier were now
very much arou?ed. and he sent a second
dispatch to Newburgh. as follows:
SAN FRANCISCO. July 2*. 13CO.
To National Bank cf N*Â»wburtrlj. N. T. : Re
ferring to our telegram this datf. one Fran*
Birtton presents ?uch checlc .Â«lgne<1 by Mrs.
Daniel H. Smith. Do you know any such per
son? COLUMBIAN BAXKINO CO.
The answer to the first dispatch arrived
about 3 p. m., San Francisco time. It
was then too late to expect any additional
answer from Newburgh that day. but the
following came the next morning:
NEWBURGH. N. T.. July 23, 1300.
Columbian Banking Co.. San Francisco. Cal.:
Person named as signing criÂ»c!c unknown to
us. C L- C. KERH. Cashier.
In the meantime th*Â» cashier of the Co
lumbian Banking Company had notified
the San Francisco police and also a pri
vate detective agency that Birtton was
probably a crook. From both he received
answer that as Birtton had not actually
committed any crime they would not ar
rest fcirn.
A3 soon as the second dispatch came
from Newburgh a search was made for
Birttcn. He could not be found. An ac
quaintance said the man had told him
that he Â¦was sÂ°ing to Nome. .Birtton haa
never been back to inquire concerning the
fata of the bogus check for J33X) nor to
demand payment of the same. The Peo
ple's Mineral Hygiene Company has not
sold $1200 worth of stock to him. nor has
that "bargain in the Mission" been closed.
Birtton is a medium-built man. weighing
about 130 pounds. He is 40 years old, height
about 5 feet i l j inches, complexion florid,
hair dark brown and parted in the mid
dle, mustache dark and short, forehead
low. eyes bright blue, nose thin and nar

He has some distinguishing marks â a
straight scar on his right hand, a scar
on his right wrist, the letters "F. S." in

was last seen h^re he wore a black Prince

I*V- 1S79 Bishop Montgomery was or
dained to the priesthood by Cardinal Gib

came to California, where he became sec

century representatives went toÂ» Ken

great State. Following the usual prelim
inary schooling. Bishop Montgomery was
sent to the. Cecilian Academy, a well
known institution in that section, and so
called because It was conducted by four
brothers named Cecil. After finishing
there he went to St. Charles College, El-
Ucott City, Md. t conducted by the Fathers
of the Sulpician Order. He pursued his
studies there with his usual energy and
with the view of entering St. Mary's Sem
inary, the great theological seminary of
Baltimore, for at this period he had al

labors. When he entered the theological

Life Story of the Coadjutor.
As chancellor and secretary to his Grace
Archbishop Riordan his genial personal
ity, his promptness and accommodating
spirit gave him the warm friendship of
all brought in contact with him.
The public services of Bishop Montgom
ery have been conspicuous for obvious
reasons, and important and far-reaching
as they have been still of infinitely great
er worth has been his varied work for the
religious advancement of the people. The
extent and value of his labor in this direc
tion cannot be conveyed in a brief sketch.
In his devotion to others he was utterly
unselfish. All the duties of his priestly
offices he has filled with the utmost devo
tion.
Always a friend of labor. Bishop Mont
gomery frequently took part in public
movements, acting in concert with other
public spirited citizens, tending to the ad
vancement and elevation of workingmen.
He was an acknowledged leader, and his
impromptu speeches, characteristic as
they were of his strong personality, never
failed to draw others to him. Physically,
2S well as mentally, strong, he is a tire
less worker. Besides performing the ar
duous duties of his offices while here and
participating in all public movements for
reform, he still found time for work
among the poor. He made no distinction
in his creed. Whenever the churches com
bined in any movement to reform public
morals, uplift the laboring man or aid the
f>oor he could always be found In the
front ranks.
As Father Montgomery' he was the or
ganizer of the League of the Cross
Cadets, and it was his untiring efforts and
enthusiastic zeal that placed that organ
ization on Its present firm footing. His
genial manners, his readiness of apprecia
tion and his quick response to youthful
ambitions engendered for him a warm
friendship In the hearts of San Francisco
youths and they will learn with pleasure
of his continued success.

"Of course," paid the Judge, "when In

proceedings and Mr. Rogers will be here
Monday as a witness."
"He will answer all questions." said
Henley, "exeppt those affecting his con

"I understand that." replied the Judge.
"You can now go. A formal order of dis

LARGE ATTENDANCE
IN THE BIG LEAGUE
The attendance at San Mateo Coursing
Park yesterday was above the Saturday
average and the opening day's programme
was carried out without a hitch.
Those who study coursing seemed to be
off in figuring chances, for, with a stake
full of dogs whose performances the tal
ent has seen often enough to be at least
fairly well posted on, their judgment was
at fault as often, almost, as it was cor
rect. In many instances dogs were made
false favorites it seemed for no other rea
son than that the grounds were new to
them and before the card was half fin
ished form was at a discount and the best
guesser cashed after the Hag was raised;

PACING RECORD BROKEN.
Splendid Performance of Princs Alert
on the Cleveland Track.
CLEVELAND, O.. July 2i.â The last
of the jrrand circuit meeting was marked
by another sensational performance. The
world's record for pacers in hobbles,
which was broken on Tuesday by Coney,
â¢when he went a mile in 2:02-4., was again
lowered by Prince Alert to-day when he
covered the mile in 2:02.
The 2:04 pace was the great race of the
meeting. The ttn entries dwindled to
three starters. Anaconda, a prohibitive
lavorite, Indiana and Prince Alert. Prince
Alert won the fim heat with case in 2:08.
In the second heat Prince Alert rushed
to the front, Roing the quarter in thirty
seconds and the half in l:01Vi. Then Mc-
Henry began to drive Anaconda. The
three-quarters was reached in l:31 & i. Both
horses came down the stretch like the
wind. Walker did not touch Prince Alert
Â¦with the whip until he was within four
or five lengths of the wire. On the other
hand Mclfenry was doinj? everything in
his power to push Anaconda to the front.
The two pacers went under the wire so
close together that many of the spectators
thought Anaconda had won. The Judges,
however, p:ivÂ«Â» the heat to Prince Alert
and marked up the time as 2:02.
In the 2:1S trot Palmleaf was the favor
it?, but it took seven heats to decide who
was the victor.
Johnny Apan won the 2:13 pace so easily
that it deprived the event of Its interest.

POLICE WIN THE
FIGHT AGAINST
BOOKMAKERS
Judge Shaw Dacicbs in Fa
vor of Acti-Poolselling
Crdinance.
An Appeal "Will Be Taken to the
Supreme Court, but in the In-
v t terim Gambling Must
Cease.
Bookmakers and ooolsellers have lost j
their fight for a wide-open town. The po- I
lice are victorious in their legal defense t
of the position they took in raiding gam- j
bling establishments after the prelimin- .
ary injunction was issued on behalf of j
the poolsellers by Judge Murasky. Judge
Lucien Shaw of Los Angeles, sitting in ,
Judge Murasky's department of the Su- '
perior Court, made an order yesterday af- .
ternoon purging Chief of Police Sullivan
and his subordinated of contempt of ,
court, with which they were charged for |
their alleged violation of Judge Murasky's
injunction. ;
Immediately following this order Judge j
Shaw swept aside the action by which the j
poolsellers attempted to enjoin the Police
Court from hearing charges against per- ,
sons arrested in the act of violating the '.
anti-gambling ordinance. The petition for
a permanent injunction to restrain the
police from visiting and molesting and
interfering with the conduct of business
in the various establishments was denied.
All preliminary injunctions were va
cated.
The bookmakers and poolsellers looked
; confident that at least trfey would enjoy
a few more weeks of profit when they en
tered court for the morning session. The
police were equally continent and their
confidence was not misplaced. John F.
Seymour, captain of detectives, was the
first witness called. He testified that he
had knowledge of the conduct of poolsell
ing and bookmaking in the establishments
kept by the plaintiffs in the action. He
had knowledge of the fact that Chief Sul-
I livan had ordered policemen to go from
I one poolroom to the other to see that the
i ordinance was not violated. Attorney
George D. Collins at one time complained
to him that police were "camping" at
Bookmaker Schwartz"? place. Fourth and
Market streets. Collins wanted the men
removed, but as the police were only oc
casionally visiting the places and not
"camping" there no such order was is
sued.
Chief Sullivan was the next witness.
He said that as Judge Murasky was about
to leave the city he knew of no better way
to bring the matter to an lsswe before
some other Judge than to lay himself
liable to a citation for contempt. He vis
ited Judge Murasky just before his de
parture and the court instructed him that
the issuance of the injunction in no way
prohibited him from performing his duty
and making arrests when the ordinance
in question was violated. As the pool
rooms were public places he ordered the
police to visit them at regular intervals,
but in no case to "camp" at the prem
ises.
Captain Wlttman testified as to the
signs in front of the poolrooms announc
ing the business carried on inside. He
always found the officers outside the vari
ous resorts when he went on his rounds
and was positive that Chief Sullivan'? or
ders not to "camp" in the places had
never been violated. Police Officers L. C
Clnrk. J. B. Freeh J. B. Collins and Je
rome H. Terril! corroborated the evidence
given by* their superiors.
Thomas L.. .War.d, Joseph Mohan. C. H.
Duncan, E. Bell and H. Simmons were
called by the bookmakers to prove that
the testimony of the police was not ba.setl
on fact. Their joint effort was a signal
lailure, however. The matter of the con
tempt" of the police was submitted after
brief argument and Judge Shaw, with a
few curt words, the siing of which was
felt by the ooolsellers. dismissed the order
to show cause and the police were purged
of contempt.
The hearing of the petition to make
permanent the preliminary injunction was
then taken up by the court. George D.
Collins had prepared to launch out on a
broad argument on constitutional rights
on behalf of his clients when 1 Judge Shaw
abruptly interrupted him by asking if he
had any new points other than those
which had l>een thrashed over during the
hearing. Mr. Collins urged that he had
and was about to continue his argument
when the court informed him that he was
of the opinion that such argument would
simply be a v.aste of time of the court to
listen to the Fame as well as a useless ex
penditure of counsel's energy to make the
same. Collins said that he believed the
effort to change the mind of the court
would be a difficult one, but with per
mission he would commence on the un
dertaking.
"Such would be useless." said Jmlco
Shaw. "Let an order be entered denying
plaintiff's petition and vacating all pre
liminary injunctions heretofore issued."
Attorney Collins took an exception to
the ruling of the court, but while he is
preparing his appeal to the Supreme
Court the. police will see that silence
reigns in the pbolselleis' quarters.

JUSTIN LADAGNOUS, TO WHOM THE BILLS ARE DUE.
JUSTIN LADAGNOUS, proprietor [
of the Maison Riche, has been
compelled to turn that famous old
French restaurant over to credi
tors and to retire from business,
as told exclusively in The Call, be
cause society men, politicians and gild
ed youths among his customers ran up
large hills and refused to pay them. There
has been joy in Bohemia over the news
of his retirement, the belief gaining cur
rency that old scores were sponged out.
The names of scores of society men and
society women, actors, army officers, pro
fessional and business men, many of them
whose names are familiar to every Ban
Franciscan, are on the .books. Ladagnous
still has hope of collecting their bills in
full or in part, but his stock of patience
is running low and he is liable to do some
thing to yet cause apprehension in Bo
hemia. , â
Ladagnous was a partner of John bo
mall In running the old California House,
which was established in 1SG0 and became
the most famous. of the French restau
rants of those palmy days.
In 18i>7 they louncied the Maison Riche
in its present quarters on Grant avenue.
For years it was the most popular place
of its kind in San Francisco. Millionaires
and merchant princes occupied its suites
! and ate at its tables. Degenerate sons
i of great men, scapegoats from across
seas, society men without incomes and
true Bohemians were also among the
patrons of the Maison Riche, and their
bad debts have wrecked it.
Ladagnous retires from business with
much bitterness in his heart for the men
who abused his confidence and also for
the rival restaurateurs who have. In his
opinion, debased the calliner.
For Ladagnous has scruples, though ue
was trained at the California House, and
now that he has no money his scruples
have an easy victory of it. :
"The Supervisors should not st0 P at
side-entrances," says Ladagnous, "cut
should turn their attention to the fcrenc.ii
restaurants. There are some of them
that are worse than all the side-entrances
in the city. 1 would not run the Maison
Riche as "these newer places are run and
I lost custom. I have lost what money
I had, but I'm glad I'm out of the busi
ness. I can go to work with a clear con
science, I am proud to say."
Prominent among the bad debts in
Ladagnous' accounts are a large number
incurred by politicians during the hot
campaigns. Ladagnous has only praise
for Phil Crimmins, who was a liberal
patron and good pay, but he asserts that
he alwavs had trouble to collect from
Martin fvelly. The latter is one of the
customers he lost. T. J. Meagher anil
"Billy" Blattner also left unpaid accounts
with him as souvenirs.
Morgan Smith was one of the last to vic
timize Ladagnous. He went to the Mai
son Riche last October, well recom
mended. He made plausible excuses as
the weeks passed and his bill grew, and
finally gave Ladagnous fraudulent checks
amounting to $600. During this time he
was the popular associate of the sons of
millionaires In the gambols along the
primrose path. In May. Ladagnous had
him arrested for obtaining money under
false pretenses, but did not appear to
prosecute him.

RUNS AND HITS BY INNINGS.
For seven innings at Recreation grounds
yesterday Iburg served up such hot dishes ,
of 'curving spheroids that the champions
were nonplussed. Then Fitzpatrick was
switched, on to the slab, not that Iburg
weakened any but as a safeguard for his
good arm, which will be used to-day when
he vies for honors with Hughes, the great.
"Fireman Fitz" played his hose well, and
when the nine innings were over Sacra
mento had but two hits registered in its
column.
The Senators displayed a new twirler, a
Mr. Perrine, who pitched well in sections.
But he met with two disastrous inningsâ
the second /and the seventh â in both of
which the local swatters made a quartet (
of runs and several hits. He wasn't the
"easiest ever," tut he could be found and
punished. The San Francisco team, w'th
but a single exception, played an errorless
game. The ginger that characterized their
play during the last series in this city was
still with them.
Hank had a gleam of happiness in the
first Inning, but it was soon transformed
into sable sorrow. Three of his own
crowded the bags without a dead man, but
no bell rang at the end of the inning. It
was in the second when Frisco did some
| thing. Krug jogged to first on four not
I over and coursed the bags when Reilly
roiled out a deep center fielder for a
doubie. " By some poor base throwing
I Keilly was permitted to score. Iburg, who j
was next up. reached the initial bag on a
missed third strike, being advanced on |
I bad throws and scoring on Brockhoff's :
| out. Hiklebrand got into the play on a
hit to left, sailed to third on poor throw
ing and scored on a double steal worked
by himself and Schwartz, who was sent
to first on balls. That was all of rtie runs
in the second.
The same game was continued in the
third. Sullivan, who walked to first, was
advanced a base by Levy's sacrifice, went
to third on a passed ball and scored on
Rellly's single.
i There was a draught of excitement In
the seventh. Pabst walked. Sullivan rolled
out a double to the center Held fence and
Levy reached first on four had ones. Then
Krug flew to Hughes, but Pabst scored on
the throw-in. A hit by Reilly, which end
ed in Senatorial juggling, gave Sullivan a
chance to get over the plate. Levy went
1 a-flying around the v bags on Brockhoff's
triple to center. The score:

â¢â¢War Is the medium of development for
the highest and noblest faculties In man.
It inspires greater courage, teaches obe
dience and inspires a firmer conviction of
duty. Life Is a. struggle and men are
made to fight. "Wars are inevitable. Men
should be ready at all times to fight. We
are living in an age when history Is being
made more rapid. y arid more momentous
events are being recorded than in the
days of Julius Caesar."
These sentiments, uttered last night by
Comrade E. S. Pillsbury at the banquet
bÂ« ard about -which the members of George
ii Thomas .Post No. 2, G. A. K., were
gathered, seemed to meet with the hearty
approval of every one of the grizzled vet
erans present and were loudly cheered..
It was the anniversary birthday banquet
in memory of the famous ger.eral whose
nume the post bears, and nearly 2uO com
rades were on ureas parade. The tables
tv ere spread in tne brea:ttast room of the
Occidental Hotel, and Major Hooper ha.u
prepared an excellent least tor nls old
comrades. Among the distinguished
guests were Major General Shatter and
Congressman K. V, Loud. Commander A.
Mautner acted as toastmaster and made
some happy remarks in Introducing the
speakers. When he arose to address tne
comrades a bugle sounded "assembly.'
Comrade W. xi. Smedberg responded to
the toast, 'â¢Reveille," by giving an inter
esting recital of the events that transpired
a-. Washington during the days which
pteceded the outbreak of the Civil \v ar.
Comrade fillsoury responded to "Guard
Mount." during which he uttered the sen
timent* above quoted. Hi3 speech was Â»n
the main nappy and in a lighter vein, but
his remarks upon war made a deep im
pression upon ail who heard them and
more than one veteran whose whitened
locks and bent rigure proclaimed tnu
, evening of life squared his shoulders and
for the moment ielt the tire of youth.
General isnafter related a number oC
very interesting personal recollections vt
General Thomas, who, he stated, was in
strumental in placing the speaker in the
I regular army at the close of the war witu
a commission of lieutenant colonel. Ac
the ctose of his speech the comrades ga\<j
three rousing cheers for the "Hero of
Santiago." ., .
Congressman Loud, In respondlns to the
toast "Dress Paraae," frankly admitttu
| that his ambition while in the army had
ueen to become an orderly sergeant ami
march with the others to "iront ana
center" on Uress parade, but h:s am
bition was never gratirted. Speaking in
a serious vein Comrade Loud sounded a
note of warning 0:1 the growing evil or
private pension ciatms of veterans of tno
Civil War, which he characterized as "tne
most pernicious legislation tnat ever pe
tered this nation. ' He pointed out the
fact that the Government was now paqrlcfi
il5o.0w.U0O annually to pensioners, wn.cn
is half of the cost of maintaining '.he tn
tire Government of the United ritates in
I lsi<i>. Nearly 5o.u0O men who participated
In the tjpaJiish-American war are new
applying lor pensions, besides the in
crease of Civil War pensioners Is year;y
growing greater.
Comrade J. H. Roberts read some cor
tributions of alleged poetry." which con
tained some excellent hits on the mem
bers of the post and created much mer
riment. . . .,* .
"The Dinner Call" was a subject which
afforded Comrade C. H. itllnn an excel
lent opportunity for a witty speech and
he proved equal to the occasion. George
Hammersmitn rtrcd "some random shots'
that were most effective in producing
merriment.
When the bugle sounded taps Com
rade Warren Olney told of those who have
gone before, old comrades in camp and
at the banquet board, who in years gone

were received to-day by both the Presby

American Bible Society corroborative of
the report that the missionaries at Pao

The message received by the Presby
terian board came from Shanghai and was
supposed to have been sent by the Rev.
George F. Fitch. It was as follows:
"Simcoxes, Hodges, Taylor, Mackay and
seven other missionaries were massacred
at Paoting-Fu. Nanking and Hunan mis
sionaries have all gone to Shanghai and
Japan."

CONFIRMS REPORT OF
MISSIONARIES' FATE
Within the last three months German firms
have sold to the Chinese Government some 200,-
Ot'O stands of firearm?, with accompanying mu
nitions of war. The prices paid and patterns
furnished have not been made public, but it
ls reported that the guns are v<yy inferior In
qu&llty. Evidently our gun manufacturers have
not felt it worth while to keep an eye open
to China. . â¢
It Is strongly suspected that a good
many of the firearms exported to Hong
kong found their way Into the hands of
the Filipino insurgents. The total . ex
ports of firearms and munitions of war
to Asiatic countries from the United
States cut a small Ilgure compared with
similar exports from Europe to the same
countries. For example, in the last an
nual report of Consul Ragsdale of Tien
tsin, dated October 11, 1S99, the following
statement is made:
Domestic exports of firearms, gunpowder
and cartridges and other explosives from the
United States to China, Hongkong and Japan
the six months ended December 31, 1S99:
Firearmsâ China. $lk>X); Hongkong, $27,978; Ja
pan, $21,376.
Cartridges and explosivesâ China, â ; Hong
kong, $4637; Japan. *:3,53S.
Xo gunpowder has been exported from the
United Plates to C"hina. Hongkong or Japan
since 1S97. China took nearly twice as many
firearms from the United States In the last
six months of 1599 as she did in the preceding
fiscal year, and about fcur times as many as
she did in 1SS6 or 1S98. Hongkong took nearly
as many in the last six months of 1899 as it
did In the twelve months ended June 30. 1S39.
and nearly thr*>e times as many as it did in
JS9T.

The Board of Public Works has re

Martha Penman to conduct a cigar stand
in the Larkin-street wing of the City Hall.
Mrs. Penman is now located where the
new electric elevator Is to be constructed
and will be obliged to move. She states
that she has herself and child to support
with no income other than that derived
from her stand. Superintendent of Build

at times and if a place must be provided
suggests that one of the vacant rooms be
given, which Mrs. Penman could fit up
to suit herself and at her own expense.
Barnett says when the City Hall is placed
in thorough repair and the corridors are
newly tinted the cigar stand will look
very "objectionable, and the present is a
good time to get rid of It.

Despondent by reason of long suffering
from consumption, William J. Skinner, a

214 Sixth street, cut his left wrist this
morning with a razor and bled to death
in his room.
The young man had been ill for two
years. During the past two weeks Skin
ner had been in much pain. Loss of sleep
had nearly wrecked his mind, and his at
tending physician, Dr. Akerly, had given
up all hope for his patient's. recovery. In
that condition, young Skinner ended his
life.
He was in his room about 5 o'clock this
morning, when he called his mother, re
questing her to bring him some break
fast. While she was preparing the meal
the sick man secured a razor and slashed
his wrist. Before Mrs. Skinner returned
the arterial hemorrhage had caused her
son's death. She found his corpse when
she went to supply him with his break
fast.

and an inquest will be held Monday.

COUNTY EXPERT HOLDS
UP CORONER'S CLAIMS
OAKLAND, July 2S.â County Expert
Bullock has again crossed swords with
Coroner Mehrmann. The expert declares
that the Coroner has exceeded his au
thority and held inquests where none
were necessary. The Coroner replies that
in his Judicial capacity it .is for him to
determine when he should' hold official in
quiries. Bullock has held up claims of
Mehrmann amounting to %ZK 05.
The case immediately in point and the
one on which the decision as to the Cor
oner's authority will be made ls that of
the inquest into the cause of death of
Agnes Jollymour.
On February 26 Agnes Jollymour ran
out of a store In Alameda, her clothes
blazing from an explosion of gasoline.
After the lire was extinguished she was
attended by Dr. \V. L.. Friedman. On
Tuesday she, made a statement to the
physician ami others that no one but her
self was to blame for the accident. On
Wednesday she died, and Coroner -Mehr
mann thereupon held an Inquest, the jury
giving a verdict of accidental death
Bullock claims the Coroner had no other
reason for holding: an inquest than the
collection of fees.
At the meeting of the Supervisors to-day
the claim was presented by Supervisor
Itoeth. It was then discovered that there
was lack of harmony between, the offices
of the expert and District Attorney. Bul
lock said he had applied to the District
Attorney for an opinion as to the legality
on the Coroner's action in the Jollymour
case, but that none was yet forthcoming.
Deputy Melvin replied that under the iaw
the District Attorney's office was under
no obligations to give Expert Bullock
opinions.- He stated to ' the board, -how
ever, that the Coroner was a judicial of
ficer and entitled to determine himself
Â¦when inquests should be held. Action on
the claim was postponed till Monday. I

Dormer party, who crossed the plains sqv
eral times and who has "been there"
when they had to park their wagons
against the red men, will volunteer to
captain the immigrant train and will
know what to do when attacked. This
idea of attacking an immigrant train has
been one of the best features in several
parades and has created the greatest ex
citement. It is the intention to make the
wagons and outfits look like '49 wagons
on the plains. Many novel features in tho
way of dances and exhibitions from the
various tribes will be .given during their
stay here.

of that county and have them in line.
During the parade the rough riders will

twelve oxen to draw the float, so as to
make the spectacle as true to the Mexican
time as possible.
As the time is drawing near for the cele

at headquarters In the Palace Hotel. The
executive officers are spurring the chair
men of committees and they in turn are
spurring the comrr.itteemen.
The celebration committee has already
received splendid encouragement in a
financial way. From the Brewers* Pro

contribution in the form of a check for
SliVJO. This is just six times the contribu

they did ten years ago. James D. Phelan
had subscribed $1000 and Mrs. Phebe

festival an amount that will aggregate
$100,000. It is expected that the amount

that $250,000 will be expended for celebra

1200,000 will be contributed by the Native

ell's story runs that he separated from
McEwen, who went over a divide in
search of deer. On the canyon side, out
of view of Mitchell, the other hunter
stalked a deer and shot at it, but missed.
McEwen followed the deer to the top of
the ridge and there Mitchell caught sight
of the animal and fired twice. Instead of
hitting the deer he shot McEwen. One
rifle bail hit the unfortunate hunter in the
throat, the bullet ranging downward
through the lungs, coming out on the
right side.
The wounded man died soon afterward.
His body was taken back to his home at
Concord, where his wife and two chil
dren are left. McEwen was 35 years old,
and was a laborer.
Mitchell is 22 years old. and a farm
hand, unmarried. Sheriff Veale of
Contra Costa County said he would go
over the scene of the shooting carefully
and determine positively that the circum
stances as "explained by the shooter are
corroborated by the surroundings. There
will be an inquest Wednesday at Mar

taking the dead man for a deer in the
brush on the mountain side. None save
Mitchell witnessed the shooting. His story
as reported to Sheriff Veale at Martinez

keep him under surveillance pending a
thorough investigation, which will be
made by the proper county officials. -
McEwen and Mitchell were strangers,

TWO MILITARY
CONVICTS GET
SAFELY AWAY
Thomas J. Ijyie and a man named
Wright, tv.-o general prisoners at the Pre
sidio, made their escape yesterday by
crawling through a quarter of a mile of
newly constructed sewer on which they
were at work. The two ex-soldlers went
to work at 8 a. m. About 10 a. m. the
sentry walked to the edge of the ditch
in -which the men had been working to
find his charges pone. A hue and cry
was at once raised and a search mado,
but Wright and Lyle could not be found.
About an hour later a dirty, unkempt
looking individual called at the back door
of a residence in the Richmond District
and requested the loan of a suit of
clothes. He had crawled over the back
fence with the intention of helping him
self, but finding the family home his con
science smote him and he determined to
ask for what he wanted. He wore a blue
shirt and troupers, the color of which
could not be described, and had an odor
about him reminiscent of the water froi:t
at low tide. The family did not hesitate
to comply with his request. A hasty col
lection of cast off clothing was made and
he selected the basement as his boudoir,
returning in a few moments attired in hU
new ouliit. He said:
"1 am an escaped prisoner from the Pre
sidio. I was working In the sewer and,
though I had but forty days of my four
teen months' sentence to serve, thought
I would sneak. I had to crawl through
a quarter of a mile of sewer to get away,
but I succeeded. I had a partner, but he
started a length ahead of me and got out
first. I haven't seen him since. I'd like
to go to China, all right, but I've had ail
the pipe I want."
Both the escapes were in for over a
year and gave no sign that they intended
escaping. The starting place of their long
crawl is within 100 feet of the guardhouse.
Private 'Welsh, Second Artillery, con
fined in the post barracks for some trivial
offense, managed to regain his liberty an
hour or so before. He was placed on the
sick report, and in company with three
others was sent to the hospital under
guard for treatment. He reached the
hospital, and that is the last seen or heard
of him. '

UGLY WOMAN'S CONFESSIONS.
The Duchess of Orleans on Her Own
Personal Looks.
Perhaps no woman was ever better rec
onciled to positive ugliness in her own
person than the Duchess of Orleans, the
mother of the Regent d'Orleans. who gov
erned France during the minority of Louis
XV. Thus she writes of her own appear
ance and manners:
.' "From my earliest years I was aware
how ordinary my appearance was, and did
not like that people should look at me
attentively. I never paid any attention
to dress, because diamonds and dress were
sure to attract attention. On great days
my husband used to make me rouge,
which I did greatly against my will. One
day I made the Countess Soissons laugh
heartily. She asked me why I never
turned my head when I passed a mirror
â evervbody else did. I answered. 'Be
cause* I have too much self love to bear
the sight of my own homeliness.' I must
have been very homely in my youth. I
had no sort of features, with little, twitch
ing eyes, a short, stub nose and long,
thick "lips. TheÂ»whole of my physiognomy
was far from attractive.
"My face was large, with fat cheeks,
and my figure was short and stumpy. In
short, I was a very homely sort of per
son. Except for the goodness of my dis
position, no one would have endured me.
It was impossible to discover anything
like intelligence in my eyes, except with a
microscope. Perhaps there was not on
the face of the earth such another pair
of ugly hands as mine. The King often
told me so, and set me laughing about
it for as I was quite sure of being ugly
I made up my mind to be always the first
to laugh at it. This succeeded very well,
thoagh I must confess it furnished me
with a good stock of materials for laugh-
e "One thing that always surprised me
was how anybody could ever fall in love
with me. I was notoriously the most
homely woman in the French court, and
vet I was only nineteen when I was mar
ried. I often asked my husband whether
my looks diu not repel him, and what
he saw in me that he should fall in love.
To my questions I have never received a
â¢satisfactory answer, but it seems to me
that other, qualities, in lack of beauty,
caused his attraction."â New Orleans Pic
ayune. "

Condition of the Treasury.
NEW YORK. July 2S.â The Financier say*:
The Ftatoment of the New York CiearinR
iK'iipe tanks for the week ending July 28 is
mere In accordance with known operations
than was the previous exhibit, although the
gains In cash are in excess of preliminary ,
ertimates. The gain in spcrle and le^als ag- j
grcsrate $4.S71,C<!0, made up for the meet part t
of ppecie. The deposit increase was $">, 667.700. i
and as this called for nearly one and a haif j
millions of additional reserve thÂ« surplus rose ]
only }3.4.'iÂ»,075, standing at J27.53o.975, as against j
$10,811,125 for the Fame week last year ati-l
nearly $42,000,000 two years ago. The decrease
in loans, which has been a marked featun
for the past six wpeks. has been checked and
fcr the six days pust th's item shows an ex- |
panrlon of 13.247.SOO. M hatever slKnlflcance
this carries Is diminished through the fact that i
the pain can be traced to two larpe banks
and represents special transactions rather than
a Keneral revival In demand. The circulation
of the banks was increased over one million
dollars last week and the total Is in excess
of twenty-five millions. This shows that tho j
banks are expecting use for this money later
on, and while the immediate market cannot
be said to present tangible evidence of a
tiehtenins in rates It is nevertheless true that
the coming month and the opening of Septein- j
ber may witness a diminution Of reserves ' be
cause of Interior demand. Just now the ro
oHpts of money from the interior are ab
normally heavy and consignments from Aus
tralia and Alaska are addlnj? to the supply.
No gold went to Europe during the past week.
but international conditions are such that the
movement is more apt to be Inaugurated nt
any time. The best judges of money conditions .
are at sea rcKardins the future and arguments !
equally plausible and entitled to recognition
are forthcoming In support of both hlKher and I
lower rates. If past years furnish any prc- |
cpdent and especially remembering that a
Presidential campaign is at hand, the welftht
of opinion favors the theory of a moderate ad
vance later in the season, although 10 !."â¢
candid conditions Just now appear to favor
stationary rates with a continued ample sup
ply of funds.

: A recovery in sterling exchange In Paris
â¢ to t^e hich pnint of the week and a Fharp rise
! In Iierlin discounts were the features of the
j day bearing on the question of gold exports
, this week.
I The bull Interest In the Ftock market dem
nnstrate<l to their own satisfaction early in
j the week that their carr.;ialKT. while easily
I fuecepsful in advancing prices, was entirely
abortive in inviting any outside demnnd for
j Fti^cke. It was easy to bid up prices, as there
i was no larire selling of stocks, but there was
I practically no demand outside of that from
the professionals themselves. When they at-
I temj..trd to sell to realize any profit prices
1 quickly brcl-.e back to where the professional
! buying had started them. The decline was
; even easier than the advance, the buying by
I shorts who wfre forced to cover on the ad
venee txMng no longer an element.
The inertness of the market on any rally
shews that the bears have but scant short
linjs. With their short interest lessoned and
with the U,ng Interest which has l>evn unable
to secure profits increased, the technical condi
tion o? the market is distinctly weakened.
Since the professional attempt to advance prices
has been al *ndoned they have settled back
to a lower ievel on a diminishing scale of ac
tivity which has iirogressed near to stagna
tion. Only those stocks amen; the special
ties which havn been influenced by inri â¢ idual
causes have shown any considerable signs of
life. The prowins coortction that a period or
money stringency i s not improbable has been
the potent influence in checking speculation for
a rise. The prevailing ease of call loans is
really a rejection of this uneasiness over the
money outlook and shows the desire of lenders
to kept) their funds in readily accessible form,
rather than a suT>erabunilnnce of Idle capi
tal. It is evident that the si>eculatlve holdings
1 of rtrK-ks in New York are at present at a
very low ebb. as the bears have failed with
1 related trials to offerings by raid
! ing dnv.n prices. The fame most be true, of
i ccnmojitles of all kinds, as the lengthening
i iterif^l of reaction in prices hns undoubtedly
! led to Reneral liquidation of speculative hold
i inps. so that prices may be said to be a nor
[ mnl index of actual supply ar.d demand. Thepe
I condttions induce a comf^rtaMe assurance of
! the soundness cf the situation nr.d account for
' th^ hardness of thf securities' market nrvl tho
firmness with which stocks arc heM. The well
recognized law that commercial criF's come
with sudden contraction of credits which have
irone to the sj*culp.tive Inflation of prices Is ;
pretty clearly seen not tn apply to the present ',
situation. The conservative purpose to avnl.l 1
weekeninjr tho flf-aticn Is seon In the deter- :
mined unwillingness of th<Â» public to- embark j
In speculation In Ftorlrs. TherÂ«Â» arc nnt lack
intr elements of uncertainty In the domestic '
situation, such as the still unmatured crops, ;
net earnings of railrjads and th? Presidcrtlal !
cajr.iaijrn. But the seat of greatest uncertainty 1
has shifted for the present to China, nven '
within Its present scope the trouble thpre in- '
surcs sufficient dei..and upon the world's
money market for war loans to materially af- !
feet their resources. The policj- inaugurated ;
by thÂ» P.ank of Kngland last week of raising
Ita discount rate and lifting the nutside dis- |
count rete to its level by borrowing from the >
market has hÂ»pn effective !ri turning the In- i
tern^tional exchange of th* world In favor 1
of Iy-indon. The Paris rate for sterling has I
reacted the latter part of tho week, caus- !
lnsr COBM renewed question whether Raid from '
New York will go next to Paris or I^ndon. 1
Rut that a larpe demand for gold remains to bp
satisfied, and that lt Is mostly met by rupplieo
in the United States because they are most
abundant and most easily shared. Is the con- i
vlrtlon of the financial world. Speculation I
halts to distinguish the effects cf this opera- :
tion.
The dullness of the Bond market gave evl- !
dence cf the present condition of capital. The ]
usual reinvestment of July dividends ar.d In- !
terest. although the largest amount was dls- ;
burred this year in the country's history, has \
been entirely lackinp in the Bond market. Lon- !
den and I'erlin are reported heavy sellers of)
high grade American railroad bonds, but no i
puch transactions have been recorded en the !

There has probably been more buylftg of
fruit In the Interior this year than ever before.
ThlÂ«i Is shown by the quality of stock arriv
ing every day. Good fruit has Iwrtn more or
less scarce ever since the season opened, though
there has been plenty of second and'vff grade
ttock. The reason for this Is that buyers have
taken up the good fruit at the orchards. This
condition la marked at the moment, most of the"
fruit comlni here being poor. Peaches, and
Pears especially. The crops, too, are not as
heavy as predicted In the fore part of the eea
son.
Watermelons are unsually active this year,
EellinK off first rate. The other melons, too,
maintain good prices, with a steady demand.

With continued large receipts the Hay mar
ket continues weak, but as pretty much all the
rraln Hay In the State Is owned by the San
Francisco dealers it makes very little differ
ence to the average farmer whether the mar
ket Is weak or firm. Buyers are comolalnlnr
of the creat difficulty In procuring supplies in
the country, and It Is a difficulty which will
probably increase from now on. Volunteer
Hay continues cheap.
Receipts of Hay are running very large again
and ths market Is weak at the decline.

ish Custom Heard by a Large
Congregation.
A large congregation assembled at the
Bush-street Synagogue yesterday morn
ing, it being the third anniversary of the
installation of Rev. Isador Myers as
rabbi of the chabai Sialomc parish. The
rabbi preached an eloquent and forceful
sermon appropriate to the occasion on the
custom of Jewish handshaking. He said
in part:
"The past is our parent and says to the
present generation of Jews, "Give me your
hand. Do not tear yourselves away from
the sacred traditions of the past." 1 Tho
future stretches out to us the appealing
arms of a little child crying to us, 'Give
me your hand.' We must live on until all
mankind shall be prepared to be sruided
by the hand of our heavenly father in jus
tice and righteousness until all men
throughout the world shall say to one an
other, 'Give me your hand.' "
RABBI MYERS PREACHES
AT ANNIVERSARY SERVICE
HER LOVER MISTAKEN
â¢FOR A BOLD BURGLAR
Henry Devlin, a Young Machinist,
Has an Unpleasant Experience
on Langton Street.
Henry Devlin, a machinist at the Union
Iron Works, met four young friends Fri
day night, and they had a dispute as to
who was the preferred lover of Sarah
Ulackman, daughter of Morris Blackman
2^">) Kangri-on street. *
While they were disputing Devlin slip
ped away and went to the Blackman resi
dence. The front door was unlocked and
he boldly entered. He saw a light in a
room, and going to the door wnispered
"Is that you, Sarah?"
It happened to be the father's room, an d
he shouted. "Who's there!" Devlin made
a break for the front door and Blackman,
seizing a candlestick, rushed after him
yelling for the police. Policeman Tobin
happened to be passing and he chased
Devlin and captured him. Notwithstand
ing Devlin's protestations, he was sent to
the City Prison and a charge of burglary
booked against him.
Â«The case was called In Judge Conlan's
court yesterday. Devlin told his story,
and his attorney said the girl was in court
to corroborate it, but he thought she
should not be humiliated by being called
upon to testify. Devlin was a hard work
ing young man and had never been ar
rested before. The Judge dismissed the
case.
After seven weeks of hard work In the
East, Attorney Louis P. Boardman ar
rived home last night. He is fresh from
the scene of the Marceau strifefand hia
experiences while in the East looking
after Mrs. Pennell's interests would
give any aspiring "Sherlock Holmes" a
good run for his money.
Mr. Boardman on his departure from
this city went direct to Washington,
where he applied to Justice McKenna for
a writ of error in the Flfmnelly case. At
the close of that case he went to New
York, where he met Mrs. Fennell, who
left this city soon after his departure, in
search of her child.
They found that the child had been taken
by the gallant colonel to Ogdensburp. N.
Y.. Â«nd placed in the care of Colonel Mar
ceau's father. When Boardman and Mrs.
Fennell reached that city they received
information that a few days previous
Marceau senior had removed the child to
CERTAIN STREETS ARE
NOW TO BE IMPROVED
Board of Public Works Will Act on
Suggestions of Commissioner
Maguire.
Commissioner Maguire yesterday sub
mitted a report to the Board of Public
Works after an examination of the streets
of this city which are in need of repaving.
The board will take immediate steps to
carry out the suggestions contained in the
report, which says:
In the district bounded . by Market and
Kearny streets and the bay, I would sugrgest
that $15,000 be expended for repavlng accepted
streets; Spear street, from Market to Howard,
Ehould be graded and paved with basalt blocks
on a sand base; Bryant street, from' Spear to
First, and thence, to the Mail rÂ»ock.
should be irraded and paved with a strip of
basalt blocks, on a sand base, of from sixteen
to twenty feet in. width; Sixth street, from
Howard to Harrison, to be graded and paved
with basalt block on a sand base; Fourth
street, fropi Howard to Harrison, to be paved
with basalt blocks on a sand base; two blocks
on Polk street, as may be hereafter determined
upon, to bo rer>aved.
The railroad rlalto Is discussing with
considerable interest the coming trans
continental and trans-Pacific competition
that is promised for the early part of next
year by President Hill of the Great
Northern Railway.
Hill has been rather a menacing quan
tity in. Western and Pacific Coast railroad
circles for several years, particularly dur
ing the time that he was financing and
building the road of which he is the presi
dent. His new scheme, if successful, will
shake up transportation circles all over
the world, and the biggest jar will be felt
by the railroads and steamship lines that
handle the commerce that goes to the
Orient through San Francisco.
The Great Northern now has In course
of construction two steamships that will
be the greatest freight carriers afloat.
Each ship will be 750 feet long, 74 feet
beam and will be able to carry the freight
of 1400 cars. Three other vessels of the
same tonnage are tobe built, and these.
in connection with his railroad and the
steamer lines he controls on the great
lakes, may enable him to make good his
promise to shippers that he will transport
goods from the Eastern cities to the ports
of China and Japan at the rate of $S per
ton.
Mr. Hill says he proposes to handle
freight but twice, once at Duluth and
again at the found, and counts on making
a fair profit on the $4 per ton share that
will go to the railroad company. Pacific
Coast railroad men. say that he may be
able to "deliver the goods,'<and competi
tors are wondering 1 what will happen in
the event Hill makes good his promise.
Under present conditions the price of.
hauling commodities from Mississippi
River points to the Pacific Coast ranges
from $10 to $15 per ton, without reference
to transportation across the Pacific.
It is stated that the Great Northern
people are confident of their ability, with
the rates named, to shut California out of
the China flour trade and to monopolize
the transportation of lumber to trans-
Pacific ports and overland. It is conceded
that the big northern railroad man pro
poses to "try out" his scheme, and the
railroad men who are interested- In the
promotion of business for this port are
figuring on what can be done to head off
Hill in the event that his enterprise
proves remunerative and becomes an es
tablished service.
One thing js declared to be certain, and
that 1b that if Mr. Hill tries any such ex
periment on San Francisco he will stir up
a transportation war the reverberations
of which will be heard around the world,
because It would be a paralyzer for Eu
ropean commerce through the Suez canal.
The advent of those big ships will be
watched with a large lot of interest by
shippers and transportation kings gener

Fake Advertising 1 Scheme.
J. R. Hay. ex-messenger boy. was held!
to answer before the Superior Court by
Judge Mogan yesterday on the charge of
obtaining money by false pretense In $2000
bonds. He was accused of swindling the
R. Dunsmuir Sons Company out of $140
by means of a contract for advertising In
a paper called the Mercantile Gazette
which had no existence. The case of
Percy Young, who was arrested in St.
Louis on the same charge and brought
back to this city, Is pending before Judza
Conlan.
who has been arrested several times, was
arrested again yesterday on a warrant
charging her with practicing medicine
without a license. The complaining wit
ness is Dr. C. C. Wadsworth, secretary of
the State Medical Board, and he accuses
her of signing a certificate as "M. D." for
the death of a child she had attended^
Noises of the Chutes.
Minnie C. Chapman of 1531 Waller
street has filed a complaint with
the Board of Supervisors against what
she terms the annoyance of the
Chutes, zoo and scenic railway. Mrs.
Chapman states that the north side of
Waller street between Cole and Belve
dere is used for a dump pile, such as wet
sand taken from the sea lions' den, and
Cardinal, Canada. Attorney Boardman
and Mrs. Fennell then journeyed tp Can
ada and located the child in the domicile
of .\rs. Kdmond, sister of the colonel. The
house was securely barred and bolted.
Ringing of the front door bell and repeat
ed knocks were of no avail. A counsel
of war was held and Boardman and Mrs.
Kennell decided to retreat. They went to
Toronto and commenced habeas corpus
proceedings against Mr. and Mrs. Ed
mond.^on whom notice was served that
the child was not to be removed until the
court had decided on the case. The day
the notice was served Colonel Marceau ar
rived on the scene from Paris. He took
the child to New York, was arrested on
the charge of abduction, was released on
$5000 bail, and the case comes up in New
York in October.
Boardman left Mrs. Fennell In NÂ«w
Tork. She will visit Paris before the
trial. Mr. Boardman will leave for the
East shortly to again take charge of the
case. '

rite. 43S Clementina street; Samuel Riga
known as "Young Jeffries," 4C0 Clemen
tina street, and Andrew J. Riley, saloon
keeper. 1133Vi Howard street. Cox lives
at 436 Clementina street.
The testimony of the witnesses showed
that Marguerite O'Brien left her home to
buy a '.amale on Sixth street. She had to
pass the Ran Francisco Athletic Club, and
Cox and Riga were standing on the side
walk in front. Marguerite asked Riga
how he had come out in his four-round
bout, and Cox chirped in that he had won.
"I was not speaking to you," said Mar
guerite, looking at Cox. and she walked
away.
As she was returning: with the tamale
Cox stopped her. and shaking his finger
under her nose said: "You're no lady."
Marguerite retorted, "You're no gentle
man, and if I were a man I would slap
your face." Riga stepped forward and
took Marguerite by the arm and walked
away with her, followed by Cox.
When they reached Marguerite's resi
dence Cox said: "Any bloomln' bloke that
says he can slap my face will have hia
bloomin' ears knocked off." Riley hap
pened along and told Cox he should be
ashamed of himself, insulting: a lady. Cox
offered to fight Riley, but Riley declined
Mrs. O'Brien appeared. anTS Cox told her
to go to her store and sell sand in her
sugar.
By this time a crowd had gathered and
Cox went Into his house, returning with
a revolver in his hand. He said- "I'll
shoot the bloomin' head off any bloke that
comes near me." Riley told him to put
away the revolver and ne would fight him
and in a minute they were clinched They
were fighting when the policemen ap
peared on the scene and arrested Cox.
Cox asked a continuance until Tuesday
to bring forward his witneses, and his re
quest was granted.
mllS. KLLA F. MURRAY, who
claims to be tho daughter and on
ly child of the late Mrs. Almira
S. Townsend, is not a resident of
California and consequently cannot be le
gally appointed administratrix of the es
tate of the dead woman," so said Attor
ney Samuel M. Sl;crtridge yesterday, and
if this contention be uphold in the court
a serious disappointment is in prospect
lor the woixian who has taken possession
oi the dead philanthropist's home and
barred the doors to the friends of its for
mer owner.
According- to Mr. Shortridge. Joseph Co-
Lurn, the brother of Mrs. Townsend, is
the or.ly relative who has a legal right
to apply for letters of administration in
the fcsiate. Coburn has nothing to say
at this Uir.e regarding his plans, but lie
has engaged the services of Rodgers, Pa-
Xerson <Â£ i?lack and iiugu Asher to look
after his interests, and some Interesting
â¢"developments may be looked for.
To be entitled to the right to administer,
presuming she is the daughter of Mrs.
Townsend. Mrs. Murray must be a bona
::Â«2a resident of the State. According to
The law, when the heir is not a resident
The next in turn is the father or mother
und then the brother. The parents of Mrs.
Townsend have ions since passed away,
so ae'-urcirsg to the law as i!iu.-rpreted by I
Air. i^hortrMgt- Joseph Coburn will be en
titled to be appointed administrator.
Ooburn points with pride to the fact
that in his array of legal talent are two
ionner judges, both of high standing.
"With these he hopes to offset Mrs. Mur
ray's "judge" attorney, as well as refute
3"att Sullivan's Ding at "sharp practition
ers"' and "shyster attorneys" who have
suspicious Jucii. in rinding -"posthumous
â¢wills."
Coburn is . not prepared to positively
etate as yet that the wnrr.an claiming to
lit* Mrs. l^;ia j\ Murray Is the daughter
of his late elster. Coburn only met his I

'not deny that the lady is Mrs. Murray.
j;Â«thrr will be r:n":rra her claim that she
Is his dead sister's daughter.
The estrangement supposed to have ex
isted betwtt-n mother and daughter is said
to havo owed its origin to religions differ
ences. It appears that Mrs. Murray in
'l:tr youth was what is known as a "wila
*::r!." that is. one of a vt ry headstrong
jiaiure, whom it was found extremely dif
licult to manape. To the* good nuns of
the Sisters of Mercy Convent the train
ing of the young girl vas intrusted, with
the express understanding that she was
Mot to adopt the Catholic faith. After a
line, however, Mrs. Murray, who was
then Miss Townsend, adopted the Cath
wiic faith, ami the <-strangÂ«-ment between
anothtT and daughter followed. This es
traxtgenuent Attorney Ash*?r intends to
prove continued up till at.-out ten years
upo, when Mrs. Murray wr< te to a promi
i.ent man of this city asking his assist
ance in locating her mother-
Th<- C "*<erence in the religious view of
parent and daughter serves to explain
Jiow it was that a I'nitariai. minister con
ducted the funeral services while Mrs.
Murray *a.t in an adjoining room receiv

permljaglon to search the California-street

iimor.g me reasons advance 1 to bear out
ihe exister.ee of such an lns'rument is the
fa^t that .Mrf. Klla Murra> has kept the

BOSTON, July Â£$.â Charles C. Brad
ford, a brother-in-law of the late Mrs.
Almira S. Townsend of San Krancisco,
was seen by The Call correspondent to
nlpht and said that he had no valuable
papers belonging to Mrs. Almira S. Town
send. She had two wills drawn up, of
which the last, made in San Francisco
about five years ago, must have been in
existence when she died. Mr. and Mrs.
Bradford are very indignant against Mrs.
Murray on account of her conduct since
the death of Mrs. Townsend.
A Boston firm of lawyers has already
applied to Mr. Bradford in beialf of Mrs.
Murray for his eo-operation Ja settling
up the estate, but Mr. Bradford, acting
under thf orders of Joseph L. Coburn of
San Francisco, a brother of Mrs. Town
send, refuses to be interrogated.
Brother-in-Law of Mrs. Townsend
Declares She Made Two.
SAYS THERE IS A WELL.
It. She !s keeping everybody out because
Fhe is afraid they might discover the hid
ing place of the document."
"Why do I beMeve there is a will?" said
! Gporj^e Tiffy. "Why. because Mrs. Town
f=en<l was ah extremely charitable woman
' and it seems logical that she would have
made some provision for the various char
itable institutions that she was interested
in. Further than that, she war, deeply de
voted to Wllmerdins:. and I am contident
that she would have wished to follow in
his footsteps; by that I mean she would
I have further endowed the charities that
} he had benefited and the ones that owed
! thfir existence to his bounty."
Yesterday afternoon City Chemists
Green and" Morgan submitted their final
report on the coiulition of the stomach
I of Mrs. Townsend. which was submitted
! to them for analysis by Dr. Leland. The
1 result of the various tests applied failed
to show the presence of any poison.
The inquest into the death of Mrs.
Townsend will be held Tuesday. Coroner
Cole is away on his vacation :tnd Justice
cf the Peace Barry will act for him.
Attorney- Shortrirfge is anxious that the \
position of himself and his associate,
George Pippy, in the matter of the Town
send heirs be clearly understood and
quotes the Code of Civil Procedure to this
effect:
"The duty of an attorney for absent
heirs is to aid and protect the court
Hgainst spurious claimants and fraudulent
devices and to brinp about a discovery of
the true heirs. Such an attorney is not
the champion of any party nor the oppo
nent of any party. He represents the
court.
"These views," explained Shortridpe,
"were set forth by Judge Coffey in the
Blythe case and by Judge "Wallace, then
Chief Justice, in estate of Simmons, 46
Cal."
Fact That She Is Not a Resident
Bars Her From Acting in the
Townsend Estate.
