"CHIANFU. JuJy II.â Messenger who

He reports that artillery of Boxers and
General Tung Fu Slang's troops made a

then levelled, afterward taking legation
by assault. Massacre folio-wed, none be

Foreign officials generally believe that
these events occurred about the end of

LAST STAND OF THE LITTLE BAND OF FOREIGNERS.
"Toward Sunrise it was evident that the ammunition of the allies was running out and at 7 o'clock, as an advance of the Chinese in force failed to draw a response, it was at once clear that it was at length completely
exhausted. A rush was determined upon. Thus, standing together as the sun rose fully, the little remaining band of Europeans met death stubbornly. There was a desperate hand-to-hand encounter. The Chinese lost heavily*
but as one man fell others advanced and, finally overcome by overwhelming odds, every one of the Europeans remaining were put to the sword in a most atrocious manner." "
''Unfortunately many of Prince Ching's troops deserted to Prince Tuan. Prince Ching fell. It was supposed that he was killed, but search for his body next morning was unsuccessful. It is now believed that he was
only wounded and was carried off and secreted by his faithful retainers. Wang Weng Shao, also a gray-haired man of* 70, evidently led the troops in person. He was killed and his force completely outnumbered and routed.
"Throughout the night repeated attacks were made on the legation, but thsy were invariably. repulsedAwithvheavy;josses. Toward jhe end of the third watch (about 5 a. m.) the allies had practically defeated the be
siegers, who were wavering and were gradually withdrawing when General Tung Pun Sian arrived from the vicinity of Tientsin with a large force of Kansubf avesl; By this time the walls of the legation had been battered down
and most of the buildings were in ruins from the Chinese artillery fire. Many X)f the allies had fallen at their posts and the remaining, small band who. were still alive took refuge in the wrecked buildings, which they endeavored
hastily to fortify. Upon them the fire of the Chinese artillery was now directed. ,
"They were not rallied until out of rifle range. Then Prince Tuan, making a desperate appeal, induced them to stand and return to the attack. Their artillery fire was resumed and at the middle watch a second attack
was attempted; but before the attackers could accomplish their object they were met by Prince Ching and General Wang Weng Shao with their troops, who were going to the aid of the foreigners. A desperate battle ensued be
tween the two forces of Chinese.
LOYAL. CHINESE ENGAGE THE ATTACKING FORCE
"Ultimately Prince Tuan decided to make an organized night attack. Having secured a p'entiful supply of ammunition for heavy guns a conference of Chinese leaders was held and a regular plan of attack was agreed
upon. In three powerful columns, with strong reserves, at 6 p. m. on July 6 fire was opened with artillery upon the British legation, where the allies and all Europeans had concentrated. For two hours walls and buildings were bat
tered with shot and shell and huge breaches were made in them. Then a general advance was ordered and the Chinese infantry, volleying constantly, moved toward the gaps. The fire of the defenders, however, was so accurate
and steady that the hordes of Chinese soldiers and Boxers broke and fled in the wildest confusion, leaving a large number of dead and wounded around the legation.
GALLANT DEFENDERS BEAT BACK THE, -ARHYOF PftlNCE TUAN.
XONDON, July 16. â This dispatch from its special correspondent is published by the Daily Mai!:" :
"SHANGHAI, Sunday Night (Urgent)â I deeply regret to have to confirm absolutely and fully the announcement which ! cabled on Friday to the effect that the legations in Peking were destroyed on the night of
July 6-7 and all British and Europeans were massacred. Further official Chinese messages, one from the Governor of Shantung, were received here yesterday and Saturday confirming the dread tidings.
"After June 25 the Boxers and imperial troops gradually increased in numbers and massed themselves about ths British legation, camping in the streets and places laid waste by the Boxers. DaHy sorties were
made by the small body of defenders, who met the Chinese in the streets, inflicting severe punishment upon them. These sorties too often took place at night. So great was the courage and energy of the little force that they
gradually compelled the Chinese to retreat from the immediate vicinity of the British legation. Soon there began to be open signs of disaffection and frequent desertions of the troops of Prince Ching, who was endeavoring to
co-operate with the besieged.

"The Boxers rushed upon them and hacked and stabbed both

caused his parents untold worry and ex

that he had been convicted and sentenced
to a long term of years in California for
a bold bank robbery. It was generally
thought here that he was still in prison
in that State until the news of his latest
robbery reached here this evening. His
brother Charles committed a burglary

The Eurnpi-an goverrsment* have re

that the European troops made a sortie
from Peking and killed 200 of Oneral

not yet effected an entrance. They are
now all bombarding with large cannon to

The Government is intensely anxious."
Finally came the news from Shanghai
that a breach had been made and the
foreigners killed. All the dates probably
refer to a much earlier period, but the

WASHINGTON. July 15.-Lieutenant
General Miles is carefully looking out for
the comfort of soldiers serving >in China.
He said to-day:
"The climate in the neighborhood cf
Tientsin and IV king is subject to great
change?. It is intensely hot in summer
and extremely cold In winter, the temper
ature In the iatter season often falling to
â¢50 decrees below zero. It 1* therefore
necessary that our troops should be sup
plied with warm clothing and plenty of
fuel. Furthermore, it may be that they
will be stationed Indefinitely In China,
how long we cannot at this moment tell.
It is* therefore desirabie that they shall
be supplied with tents and tent floors.
Everything will be done for the comfort
of the men that can be foreseen."
General Miles reiterated that he was
not going to China. A friend pointed out
that the American force in China would
be too small for an officer of the grade of
lieutenant general to command. General
Miles would naturally be glad to go could
he be in supreme command of the alliei
force?, but this Is impossible in view of
the determination of Japan to send a field
marshal.

CHANGE IN THE ROUTE
OF ATTACK ON PEKING
: Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES. July 15.â "I do not give
up hope that my brother is still safe in
Peking, and that he and his family are
being protected by the Chinese authori
ties." said Rev. Edwin A. Conger, brother
of the American Minister, to-night. "It
Is true that many adverse statements
have been received, but hope is gained
from the report that the Chinese officials
have secreted the American representa
tive in the palace. From this circum
stance, I am led to believe, arises the fail
ure to hear direct from my brother."
When the Rev. Mr. Conger last heard
from his brother, on May 2S, the
American Minister was exceedingly anx
ious over rumors of an uprising that came
to Peking from the northern provinces.
Owing to the dangerous outlook Minister
Conger gave up his intended vacation for
this summer and the plans he had out
lined for participation In the present po
litical campaign.
Minister Conger was the recipient of
many honors as he passed through Los
Angeles and Pasadena in May. 1S96, on
his way to the Orient from Brazil, whence
he haCd been ordered by cable by Presi
dent McKinley. With Minister Conger
in Peking are Mrs. Conger, his daughter.

CHEFU, July 10 (via Shanghai, July
15).â Se\'eral hundred refugees, most,' of
them women and children, have left Tien
tsin in accordance with Admiral Sey
mour's order to all non-combatants to
depart. Many women have remained be
hind, however, refusing to leave their
husbands, whose business detains them.
The refugees were sent down the river on
lighters and tugs, and were then" trans
ferred to merchant ships in the harbor.
The American. Japanese and German
warships received their people, the offi
cers of the United States gunboat York
town generously entertaining 200, many
of them missionaries and their families.
The British refugees were crowded in a
dirty freighter, and women accustomed to
luxuries have been sleeping huddled to
gether on the decks. They complain bit
terly because the half-empty British fleet
declines to receive them, and they have
drafted a strong protest to Admiral Sey
mour.
The United States transport Logan haa
arrived with the Ninth United States In
fantry from Manila. The work of dis
embarkation will occupy several days, as
boats are scarce. The Logan will take the
American refugees to Nagasaki and the
Yorktown will leave to tow the Oregon to
Yokohama.
Cannon from the warships are being
gent to Tientsin to silence the Chinese
guns. Twenty-three guns shelled the Chi
nese batteries yesterday, the Chinese re
plying Intermittently. Bodies of from 2000
to 3000 attack the foreign lines dally. A
field battery is supporting the brunt of
the attacks against the railway station
and agalnat the Russian and Japanese
outposts in that neighborhood. Bullets are
dropping throughout the foreign set
tlement at all hours of the day and the
people have become so accustomed to ft
that they go about the streets undis
turbed.

NON-COMBATANTS ARE
FLEEING FROM TIENTSIN
NEW YORK, July 15.â A special to
the World from Washington says:
In the following publication th!3
morning of President McKtnley's
plan for China the World presents
In detail the administration's policy. The
Information herein contained comes direct
from the President himself, with but one
intermediary. The points decided upon
are these:
To co-operate with the powers for the
relief of foreigners in Peking If alive and
the punishment of the murderers If dead.
The United States will furnish Its full
quota of men and warships and bear Its
ehare of all needed expenses. But such
co-operation does not mean any deviation
from the fixed policy of Independent ac
tion. The allied army must march to
Peking. The United States will not be a
party to any alliance hereafter formed
for the dismemberment of China or the
acquisition of territory.
The United States will protest against
the dismemberment of China. Open door
trade relations and a distinctive govern
ment must be maintained. In any event
the United States. Great Britain and Ja
pan will act in unity as against other In
terested nations.
China must pay all expenses sustained
by the United States in prosecuting the
present efforts to relieve Peking. The In
demnity demands will depend altogether
on the expenditures made necessary In
conducting the projected military opera
tions.
A formal declaration of war will not
be made against China by the United
States, nor will the United States be a
party to any declaration of war by any
other nation, neither "Will It be recog
nized that a state of war exists. -
Kven the death of Minister Conger will
not render a session of Congess necÂ£3
sary.
The President will not return to Washt-
Ington at this time.
It is not Intended to Increase the pres
ent naval force in Chinese waters. It is
considered sufficient to meet all emergen
cies. Â«

CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLINGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, July
15. â When I showed Minister Wu the official confirmation from Shanghai of the Peking
massacre, he said:- "I have no news of this. â¢ In fact, I have heard nothing since the dispatch
I received from Sheng this morning. If this news be true, then I am too deeply shocked, too
sorry to be able to say anything that would express my views of this catastrophe."
'When I showed Minister Wu the dispatch announcing that the Governor of Shan
Tung confirmed the news of the massacre, he said:
"It is very sad, very sad. I no longer can believe that there is any room to doubt they
have been killed. My oijly hope is that not all of them perished; that some were saved, per
haps, through friendly Chinese, and particularly do I hope that Minister Conger and his fam
ily escaped. I do not like to talk about the massacre. It is too horrible.
"The Governor of Shan Tung is in a position to speak authoritatively. He commanded
8000 soldiers at Tientsin before he was promoted to be Viceroy of Shan Tung. He had them
thoroughly drilled and took them with him to his new post. With these he undoubtedly has
been able to establish reliable courier communication with Peking, not telegraphic but by run
ner. The distance is traversed by carts in about ten days, but runners can make it in five.
"I would give anything," he continued, "to get an answer to the message I sent Minis
ter Conger. That would upset all of these press dispatches, in which I cannot distinguish the
truth from falsity. But not a word has come â not a word have I heard from my Government.
I do not understand the situation at all." â¢

The Western Union opened its office this
morning in a. grocery store, and the
Pcstal ha* j opened an o3ice' at
the railroad dspot. The electric
li^rht pole?? and wires were de
stroyed in the burned district, and tne
town tvill be in darkness until they can be
replaced. T>>e company also owns the
telephone system, and Uvses more than
half of its instruments.
In the excitement last r.isht it was
stated that on? rr.:in lost his life In the
fire. This fortunately proves to have been
At sunset the wind, which had blown a
gale during the day, died away and the
aan&Dg debris shot* forth a livid glare as
in mockery at the scene of desolation.
Hundreds of neonle visited the pla.ee dur
ing- the day from the surrounding country
and adjacent mining camps. The aftpr
noon train from Phnenix and the one on
the Prescott and Ka.Â«tern from Mayor
brought larjre delegations from those
places. Citizens who yesterday were com
fortably fixed are to-day homeless and
penniless, a. number losing both their bus
iness places and their residences. An
army of carjÂ»enters has been bu.Â«y all day
putting up temporary structures, many
of which have been completed and will
open for business to-morrow.
Of the three printing oQces In town all
that was saved was a.bout thirty cases cf
type by the Courier. The destruction of
the others was,comp!ete. The proprietor
of the Journal-itiner saved onlr his
books. Included in the latter's loss was
a Mergenthaler linotype installed in the
office only three months ago. The two
above papers have already made arrange
ments for continuing publication, al
thouih but little insurance was carried by
either.
In conversing with a number of the
heaviest losers to-<iay it was learned that
most of them will rebuild at once.
The oriTin of the fire was unknown un
til this evening, when it was learned that
a man rooming- over the bottling works
was lying- in bed readinj? by candle light
Â¦when a piece of loose pap^r on the wall
caught fire. He ran out to give the alarm
and before others reached the place the
fire wajj beyond control.
Extra police are on Rtiard to-nijrht over
goods ia temporary structures erected to
day and over the vaults of the banks
which are exposed to view, and the fire
patro! is also bein^ maintained to prevent
ajjy- fresh, outbreak, although with the dy

the gpate.it desolation and feellr.x of

Ailthat remains of the principal trisiness
portion of the town is tottering wills and
piles of charred and burning debris.
The Sre, which started at 10:15 o'clock

except one in the town, besides scores of
private residences. To add to the prevail

greatest vigilance to prevent another out
break of the conflagration. Owing to the
chaotic condition existing to-day it ia im
possible to pbt.Tin an accurate account
of the loss or individual insurance. The
most conservative estimate of the total
loss places it at from a million to a mil

PALL HEADQUARTERS. SANTA
CRUZ, July IS.â The stirring sound
Uof reveille awakened Camp O'Ryan
at 6:2^ o'clock this meming. Hardly
had the echo of the baste died away
in the distance when the cadets
poured cat cf their tents and prepare-! for
the day"? duties and pleasure?. Ten min
utes later the regimental band took up Its
station close to the tall flagpole, and as
the Star? and Stripes were hoisted to Its
p^ak the strains of the national anthem
fined the air. As the flag was hoisted the
cadets paused in their work ard stood at
attention. After a h?arty breakfast of
Eu?h and milk, chops and steaks, and
tisc-Jirs like "mother used to make." the
regiment prepared for church.
At S^O o'clock the regiment, headed by
Colonel K. J. Power, marched to Holy
Cross Church, where a special mass was
celebrated fcr the fc^n^fit of the organiza
tion. Rev. Fatter Phil O'Ryan. spiritual
dir<Â»ctor cf the regiment, was the cele
brant, and he was assisted by Rev. Father

was crowded with parents and friends of
the cadets. The latter were seated in the
body cf the church and made a martial
appearance in their natty uniforms. As
they answered to tbp prayers of the priest
the clattering of their swords echoed
through the edifice. The mass was not.

which was rung at the altar at the eleva

Services being concluded the regiment
marched back to camp. The boys em
ployed the time that intervened before the
call for dinner by playing ball and swim
ming in the Â«urf.
The city i< well filled with visitors who
came here to enter into the social life of
the camp. Throughout the day they rilled
the camp grounds.
The flrst night in camp was remarkable
for its incider. r s and excitement. Tired
as they were after their long journey, the
rollicking cadets managed to have fun
making the lives of their fellow members
miserable. Those who secured sleep had
to take anesthetics. When "taps" was
blown and the camp was in darkness
sounds of all kinds emanated from the
tents. Then the stragglers began to stroll
Into camp. Some came through the gate.
others ciimbed the fence, many came
through convenient holes made by the ad
vance guar^ The guard was on the alert
and made many captures. The unfortu
nates were compelled to seek rest in the
guardhouse and in the morning clean the
streets.

One Hundred Thousand Dollars' Worth
of Property Destroyed by
NEWCASTLE, July 13.â At 4 o"c!ock
thi^ morning- a fire destroyed the entire
budin>a35 portion of Newcastle.
It i3 supposed that the tire originated
in an old ice house occupied by tramps.
It spread rapidly, completely destroying
all the fruit houses of the town and other
lead'"- business houses and several fine
residences. So rapid was the progress of
the flames that little personal property
waa saved. The total loss exceeds $100,000.
The principal losers are: Earl Fruit
Company, fruits, box lumber, paper COOK
Porter Bro*.' building, stock of lumber,
paper, nails. JI'ViiW: W. J. Wilson &. Son.

ance is hardly 50 per cent of the loss.
Rapid progress will be made toward the
resumption of business. The ru3Q of the
season is now on md the delay will cause
heavy losses to shippers and producers.
Over ten thousand boxes of fruits were
destroyed.
Clearing Away Dabris.
Th<Â» work of ctearfn? away the debris Is
proceeding in a gratifying manner. The
railroad company shows due appreciation
cf the importance of prompt action, and
is sparing BO effort to respond fully to the
demand3 of the situation. It i3 clearly
seen that the shippers will be in a position
to protect the interests of the community.
and Eastern shipments to-morrow will not
be much short of the usual output- It is
possible that for a day or two the shipping
facilities of Penryn will be availed of.
The town has been in a turmoil of ex
citement all day. Thousands of people
from all directions visited t>* town, ex
pressing condolence and offering aid if re
quired, but as no suffering exists no as
sistance will be required, and Newcastle
extends thanks to her kind neighbors.
Newcastle has for many years been the
pri.de and upbuilder cf Placer County, and
now in her Srst serious reverse It is a
matter of extreme pleasure that such a
kind display of sympathy is shown. Satur
day had been a busy day. and the crews
of clerks and carloaders had been busy
far into the ni?ht. This has been the
usual daily routine, and in the morning
with tirÂ»d. drowsy men. it was not an
easy task to arous-* a town, when the cry
cf tire was rirÂ«t heard.
It seemed a long interval before a sec
end voice was heard giving the alarm. A
prominent merchant who heard the ear
liest voice sprang from his bed in his
store. He believes he was not fifteen sec
onds in dressing. He at once turned a
span of hor^s out of his barn and closed
the gate. He had only time enough to
rave his ledger, cash register and a cab
inet of blanks, etc.. when the names
drove him frora his building, which was
thoroughly dismantled and only the
solid brick and stone wall remains.
Bnilding3 Destroyed.
The Earl Fruit Company has been, using
a new shed which the railroad company
built a couple of years ago for public ac
commodation. It consequently loses no
building. Porter Brothers & Compar.v
among others losses include the finest
frnit house in the county and also load

"THE POTHOUSE BOSSES."
(Calaveras Chronicle.)
Speaking under the caption of "The Pot
house Bosses." the San Krancisco Call
says that Kelly and Crimmins have about
as much right in the Republican party as
a "burglar in a bank," and further says
about them that "it is better to keep a
polecat out of your house than to let him
in and then try to put him out." Correct.
In the name of political decency and com
mon sense, don't allow the Republican
party to be the haven or refuge for Demo
cratic skunks. They are good for nothing
other than to raise a stink and Infect any
organization in which they are permitted
to parade to the extent of driving out re
spectability. Bury them deep ln oblivion,
where they belong. Those infectious ani
mals are altogether too offensive to the
olfactories of decent people. They have
stunk up their own nest so as to be un
bearable to ,thelr old-time political asso
ciates, and it is no wonder that they must
be run out.

TRYING TO EXPLAIN IT.
SO utterly foolish was the action of the Demo
cratic convention in reasserting the free silver
demand of the Chicago platform and renomi
natirig Bryan that to a considerable number of intel
ligent men the thing seems to require explanation.
They can hardly accept the result as but another evi
dence of Democratic capacity for blundering and in
capacity for statecraft, and are persuaded there is some
.hidden plot or plan in it that ought to be brought to
light.
Among those seekers after the motives that
prompted the bosses at Kansas City is Senator Caf
fcry of Louisiana, who, looking at the proceedings
from the standpoint of a Southern Gold Democrat,
has come to the conclusion that the Southern dele
gates were swung to Bryan and free silver by the de
sire on the part of a large, number of powerful South
ern interests Jo about the re-election of Mc-
Kinley. The South has been very prosperous during
the last four years, and the leading business men of
that section have sense enough to understand that the
prosperity has been due mainly to 1 Republican legis
lation. They do not wish a change. " They wish an
other four years of prosperity.- The politics of 'their
States is such as to prevent giving the electoral vote
to the Republican candidate, and therefore their only
way to help the good cause of continued prosperity
was that of getting the Democrats to nominate a man
whose record and whose platform would assure defeat.
The suggestion is ingenious, but does not account
for all the facts. Some of the foremost Southern
States objected to a reiteration of the silver plank, and
would have gladly dropped it from the ' platform al-

PERSONAL MENTION.
AMDSUMMER MARKETS.
r\ S far as activity is concerned, trade is now down
/ \ to the lowest midsummer level. In the East
* trn States everybody who can get away from
office and shop is off in the country' or at the sea
shore, and the clerks are left to pick up the few stray
pennies that come along. Wall street is deserted,
commercial speculation is suspended, and there is
nothing new or noteworthy anywhere in sight. This
condition of affairs will probably last for at least
thirty days longer.
In spite of all this stagnation, however, some ob
servers think they discern more tone to business.
The movement in merchandise is light, to be sure,
but the feeling is firmer in some lines. The settlement
of labor questions between employers and employes
has improved the industrial situation somewhat, and
the lumber business is exhibiting rather more life,
due, possibly, to lower prices. But the large iron
and steel concerns find themselves unable to control
prices as they did last year, and another sharp cut in
quotations is threatened. Still, rather more move
ment is reported at Chicago. Wool continues very
weak, and the Westerners are now offering their
holdings at prices which they refused some time ago,
without, however, finding buyers. The hide and
leather and boot and shoe trades continue to report
dragging and weak markets, with accumulating
stocks, and provisions are brisk one day and neglected
. Â¦Â¦
the next.
Wheat has been on the down grade for some days.
Persistent belittling of crop damage in the Northwest
by well -known publications and individuals has had
its effect: some heavy holders have let go and the
small fry have generally turned bears. The talk now
is of a crop of 550.000.000 bushels, and though
Chicago Board of Trade operators characterize the
estimate as absurdly large, it is having its effect on
the market just the same. The dry weather specter
is now stalking through the corn market, and the
crj' is that the crop in the western end of the corn
belt is halt destroyed already, and unless rain comes
within a very few days the other half will go, too.
The chief damage is ir- Kansas, Missouri, Iowa and
Nebraska. But it may be remarked in passing, that
the rain generally happens along at the last minute,
in other parts of the -world, just as it does in Cali
fornia, and saves at least a portion of the crop.
We are having our little weather bugaboo out here,
too. It ti:rns out now that the supposed enormous
hay crop which we harvested in May and June was
rot so enormous after nil. and that good grain hay is
actuany scarce, ho prices have been going up right
along, a condition very unusual in July. There is
plenty 01 poor volunteer hay, but not enough of the
best quality. There is a prune scare in the Santa
Oar?. Vallcv. too. and the Cured Fruit Association
officially announces a serious reduction in the size of
the crop, ov.ing to a heavy drop and the stoppage ?n

conditions in California <ecm to be as promising is
usual at this time of the year. The merchants in
San Francisco are doing rather more business than
the average in midsummer, thanks to the continued
fine export trade of the port. The shipments out of
the port thus far this year have been remarkably
heavy, owing to the great development of the de
mzrA for the north, the Pacific Islands and the Orient,
and were it not for this the town would be rather

5N order properly to comprehend the inner affairs of tho
Chinese empire, the first thing, needful is rightly to dlstln-
suiph the different parties in China. The Empress Dow-
ager holds on to the old ways; her party is known as the
"Empress* party." The Emperor and his friends, who de-
sire reform, are known as the "Emperor's party." Then there
is a third party, known as the "middle party." which is chiefly
concerned with its own interests and dares not interfere In
politics. Nine-tenths of the people and officials are comprised
in this party.
The Empress Dowaser, notwithstanding that she is the
head of the ruling party, possesses lew or no friends outside of
ofHc'al rirflps and the Yamens. Otherwise her influence is
small. Her intimates p.re all Manchus. Yung I^u. appointed by
Nr commander In chief; Kangwei; special commissioner for the
collTtion of additional revenues from th<? provinces; Prince
Tuan, Yun Yu, Bwai-ta-pu, etc. The only clever man among
them is YungLu- the rest are densely ignorant and care for
rotMrc but wealth and official rank. Of the high military
omeialf. Tun.-Fu-Siang belong to the Empress' party and
Yunn-Shl-Ivai to the emperors. All the remainder may be> said
to belong to the middle party. Thus I am right in saying that
the Empress' party are few In number, although at the mo-
mont their power is great
The middle party; on 'the other hand, is spread throughout
the whole empire. The majority are in their heart of hearts
devoted to the Emperor, admiring his intelligence and rectl-
tude and these are alarmed and angry at the Empress' usur-
patio'n They know how Ignorant she Is and what a dissolute
fife she has led for the lasfthirty years, and that the weakness
of China Is largely due to her misdeeds. But the nisn officials
are too old; they sit blinking in the twilight, not daring to act,
but leaving success or ruin to come, as the Emperor or thÂ»
Empress gains the upper hand,
Ruined as the Emperor's party is, yet they arÂ© the r*al re
formers; both officials and people, they long for reform and
new methods, but while the Empress' party hold the power
they are in dread of severe punishment. At the time of tfcÂ»
eoup d'etat the Empress falsely asserted that the Emperor'3
party was planning revolt. She prohibited newspapers, killed
and drove out hundreds of reformers and exiltd numbers of
high officials to the frontiers. Six of the reformers executed.
were high metropolitan officials, one a member of the Grand
Council and one whom the Emperor had nominated to be Prtma

REGISTER fIND ENROLL.
BY the combination which has been effected
among the ward bosses and the political touts
of the Southern Pacific road there has arisen
a formidable menace to honest politics not for this
year only but for ten years to come. The alliance of
the ward gangs with the corporations has not been
arranged upon any of the great national issues before
the country, but upon a programme for controlling
the Legislature, so that this winter they may fix the
Assembly, Senatorial and Congressional districts to
suit their purpose, and that purpose is to put them
selves in a position of vantage in all legislative or
Congressional elections for the next ten years.
Because the electoral districts of the State are to be
reorganized this wintet a double importance is given
to the approaching election. The better class of citi
zens have not only to defeat Bryanism in the nation,
but they have to prevent the bosses and the tools of
a corrupting corporation from obtaining control in
the State. If the Southern Pacific Company have
the power to fix the various Assembly, Senatorial and
Congressional districts for the coming decade, it is
a foregone conclusion the districts will be so gerry
mandered that in many of them the railroad will be
able to elect almost any one it chooses â even its yel
low dogs. It will have control of the Legislature,
and through that control it will have power to vir
tually dictate who shall be chosen to represent or mis
represent California in the United States Senate.
The danger is one against which the voters must
be on guard, and the responsibility of vigilance rests
particularly upon Republicans, for it is to that party
the people look for good government this year. Cali
fornia will surely vote for McKinley and Roosevelr,
and in all probability will return a solid Republican
delegation to Congress." That being so, the voter-;
will naturally be inclined to cast their votes for all
other Republican candidates, so as to make a clean
sweep. It is therefore of the highest importance that
the Republican legislative tickets should be com
posed of men who are not in any way subservient to
either the bosses or the corporations.
There is but one way in which the fight for honest
politics can be won this year, and that is by induc
ing every loyal Republican to register, so that he will
have a right to vote, snd then enroll in a Republican
club, so that he can take an active and efficient part
in the campaign. It is beyond dispute that if good
citizens organize and work they can win, and that if
they do not win it will be their own fault.
In this contest it will be folly to make terms with
Kelly and Crimmins and their saloon following.
Those bosses are already in the railroad camp along
with the Democratic bosses, and on election day will
knife Republican candidates should the railroad
managers give orders to that effect. They are fight
ing now, as always, not for the party, but for their
own gang; not for principles, but for the spoils. They
would like the privilege of arranging the political dis
tricts of San Francisco for the next ten years, and to
obtain that privilege they will not hesitate a minute
to betray the Republican party. The path of safety
for Republicans is that of straight, honest politics,
rnd along that path there can be no walking with the
corrupting managers of the Southern Pacific or the
corrupted bosses of the grog shop gangs.
e PLAIN WAY GPEN.
CHINATOWN is known to our people as a
"problem." Every issue that arises out of it
is called by that name, and so impressed has
the public become with the problematic features of
the relation of that district to the rest of the com
munity, a good many citizens overlook the fact that
some of the issues connected with it are not in any
way complex, but quite simple and vtry easy to bo
solved by any municipal administration that will go
about it in a plain, straightforward way.
Why should the enforcement of sanitary regulations
in Chinatown be a problem? What mystery stands
in the way there any more than elsewhere? Why is
it not as simple to require the owners of property in
Chinatown to keep their premises in good order as
it is to make that requirement of owners of property
in other parts of the city? The law is plain, and as
the violation of the law is also plain to be (seen and
readily proven, the application of the law to the vio
lators ought not to be anything very difficult in tho
way of a problem.
In the years following the war. when gold was at
a premium, the resumption of specie payment was re
garded as a very complex subject. Statesmen lay
awake at night thinking about it, and the wear and
tear on the American brain was something tremen
dous. By r.nd by some one suggested, with caution,
that probably the best way to resume would be to
resume. That view was scouted at first, but eventually
those in authority decided to try it. The Govern
ment resumed specie payment, and to the surprise of
a good many the thing was as easy as eating pic. Our
municipal authorities ccn learn a lesson from that ex
perience of the nation. The best way to enforce the
law in Chinatown is to enforce it.
The Call does not deny that many of the relations
of Chinatown to the community as a whole are in
their nature so complex and so involved with personal
and property rights that they constitute genuine
problems which can be dealt with adequately only
after careful consideration and probably at a great
cost; but it does deny that the enforcement of sani
tary regulations within the Chinese district is in any
way a complex issue. Neither the tenants of China
town buildings nor the owners of the buildings have
any personal rights or property rights that run con
trary to the health laws of the community. There is
nothing in the enforcement of the laws which calls
for much worry on the part of official. brains or of
much cost to the community.
In this, as in many other cases, the plain way is
the best way. The difficulties that loom up across
the path of public improvement are frequent 1 /
imaginary and vanish as soon as they are approached
with clear vision and a. resolute will. Let the Health
Board and the police authorities give notice to the
Chinatown property-owners to clean up their prem
ises and keep them clean, and if the order be not
obeyed, then let arrests be made summarily and im
partially, as was done in the case of the garbage-cart
offenders, and within a very short time that phase -of
the Chinatown question will be settled and the way
cleared for considering the problem that remains.

NO journalistic achievement of recent years has been more widely commented upon than The Call's ex
posure of the frauds practiced in the probate of the estate of the late Joseph Sullivan in Superior Judjre
Troutt's court. This paper was actuated in publishing the scandal by the duty it owed to the public. It
asked no other reward than that the rascals should be punished. It was gratified that, following quick on the pub
lication of the story, the main conspirator, John M. Chretien, was put behind the bars, and now it takes added
satisfaction in knowing that its contemporaries throughout the State feel justified in applauding its course. A tew
of the many editorial utterances on the matter are herewith given:
THE MONITOR.
The bogus heir Industry receives a temporary check by the
revelations in the Chretien swindle, in Judge Troutt's court.
The Call is entitled to praise for bringing about the exposure
of this unsavory transaction.
Â« â¢ â¢
OAKLAND ENQUIRER.
The Sullivan fraud was far from being Lawyer Chretien's
first misstep, but it was the first one which landed his foot
in a boar trap. And but for The Call this robbery might have
been carried through successfully. The rest of San Francisco's
crooked attorneys will now resolve to be more circumspect,
but not, we fear, more honest.

HOLLISTER FREE LANCE.
The San Francisco Call performed a splendid piece of Jour
nalistic work this week in exposing the nefarious operations
of 'a crowd of scoundrelly lawyers who were endeavoring to
loot an estate. Judge Troutt, In whose court the transactions
occurred, stands in an unenviable light before the public, and
owes It to himself* to prosecute the scoundrels to a finish. A
newspaper that accomplishes the exposure and overthrow of
villainy performs signal service to the community, and Tha
Call is entitled to all possible credit for Its good work.

ALAMEDA ARGUS.
There is or.e thing in connection with the Chretien disclos
ures that will strike some people as queer, and that is the
apparent ignorance of court and attorneys concerned of his
character. Even the atmosphere far from the court, where
Chrttien ne /er came in the flesh, was heavy with the general
odor of his crookedness. How it came that the Judge, who
must know more or less of the general reputation of all who
practice at the bar, and "the lawyer who "wanted him to make
a fee," and the various others who had to do with the matter
were so blissfully Ignorant of his nature will constitute a mys
tery indeed.

John M. Chretien, as crooked a lawyer na ever dlahoner'vt
his profession, has confessed. With cowardly heroics he has*
taken the blame of everything upon himselfâ that was his last
play. It now remains for tho officers of the law to find a
charge upon which he may he legally convicted, for he is *
self-confessed scoundrel, forcer, thief and robber of the dead.
Judge Troutt. who appointed Chretien as the representative
of the absent heir, was elected to office through the influence
of Martin Kelly, an unspeakable politician. Kelly owned the
convention and nomtnated Troutt. Chretien has lor.s been
known as Martin Kelly's office boy. It was he who took the

to be unconscious of the kind of a man he was selecting for a
responsible trust. And so through weakness or political pres
sure Judge Troutt has put himself !n anything but a dignified
position. Chretien has confessed; for the first time In his Ufa
he has sworn away the reputation of the right man. His con

omitted, but there is enough sincerity In it to send any thief
to jail, and this man ought to be put out of sight of honest
people. We pay our compliments to The Call, which had tho

Chretien's guilt and make It known to the world. When Jour

together. Thus it has been noted that "16 to i" was
forced into the Democratic platform by delegates
from Iowa, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Mas
sachusetts, Oregon, North Dakota and Washington,
against the votes and protests of sure Democratic
States like Virginia, Texas, Tennessee. Florida, Geor
gia, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi and North
Carolina.
The part that New York played in the convention
has also been the subject of a good deal of comment.
The vote on the silver plank in the committee on plat
form was so close as to justify the conclusion that had
Hill been a member of the committee he would have
been able to defeat it. Thus Tammany is largely re
sponsible for making 16 to 1 an issue in the cam
paign, and as that has materially lessened any chance
the Democrats may have had of carrying the State,
there has been some speculation concerning the mo
tive that prompted the folly. There are some who
assert that Croker acted from passion merely, that
his sole motive was a hatred of Hill and his only ob
ject that of humiliating him. There are others, how
ever, who maintain that Croker is never so angry but
that he. keeps a cool head to look out for the main
chance and profit by it. These declare a conviction
that Croker is persuaded that Democracy could not
carry New York this year under any circumstance?,
and therefore he stood in with Bryan because that
would give him a chance to hold the radical and
Populist vote in New York City and thus give Tam
many a local victory, no matter what happened else
where.
All of these explanations are amusing contributions
to the campaign. They serve to keep up public inter
est in the Bryan movement and reveal the folly of it.
Of course none of them are worth much. It has been
said of old that an ass eats thistles because he is an
ass, and the same reason explains why Democracy
nominated Bryan. ,
PUNISH ALL THE SCOUNDRELS.
THE preliminary examination of the self-con
fessed scoundrel, John M. Chretien, the shame
less robber of the dead, who was stopped in his
criminal career by The Call, will begin this morning
Â«n the Police Court of A. J. Fritz. There never has
been, perhaps, in the history of this city an investiga
tion of more vital moment to the integrity of our
courts than this will be. The most sacred relation
ships of the courts to the people are involved. The
estates of the unprotected dead must be guarded if
the living are not to be injured and despoiled by
ghouls masking as attorneys.
The Call has uncovered the appalling condition of
affairs which exists in one of our probate courts.
There is not a family in California which is not inti
mately concerned in the outcome of that ex
pose. The Call has revealed the shameful fact
that an estate can be stolen by legal thieves,
that a bogus heir can pass successfully the winking
scrutiny of lawyers, Judges, witnesses and notaries,
and that a duty, deeply solemn in its nature, can be ig
nored. It is the duty of the court to see that this
vicious criminal work shall not be continued in San
Francisco.
As far as the facts of this particular case are con
cerned there is nothing further to say. They were
published in their startling entirety in The Call last
Monday, and the allegations of this paper were sub
stantiated by the sensational testimony which was
given before Judge Troutt.
One of the scoundrels concerned in this crime
against the living and the dead, John M. Chretien,
confessed his guilt in court. He has since made four
other "confessions," all of them lies in part and none
of them containing a fact which The Call did not pub
lish before he. in shameful self-abasement, admitted
his scbundrclism. It is the duty of the courts and of
the prosecuting officers to sec that the other rascals
who were concerned with Chretien shall not be
shielded by his "confessions." but shall pay with him
the penalty for their atrocious crime.

Enjoy the Hospitality of the
Moraghan Boys.
The Moraghan boys have reason to
congratulate themselves on the outing
they gave their friends at their oyster
beds on the San Mateo shore yesterday.
The tug Elizabeth and the plungers Dan
dy and Boxer were pressed into service
and carried as' jolly a crowd to the north
erly line as ever left the water front.
The plungers were the first to get away
and of course arrived at the oyster beds
llrst. The tug Elizabeth waited for the
stragglers and it was nearly 10 a. m.
before she left Channel street and about
noon when the scene of the festivities
was reached. Oysters there were in
abundance and the finest of stout to wash
them down, while sandwiches and wine
and other beverages were abundantly
served.
Harry Neuman. Dan O'Callaghan. M.
Lawley and Professor McKenzie made
things hum in the musical line and Im
promptu songs and funny stories made
the time fly. James Moraghan told the
party during a lull in the enjoyment that
his "father, the late M. B. Moraghan.
had inaugurated these yearly excursions
twenty-two years ago and one of his last
wishes was that his sons should keep
them up. For that reason if for no other
the Moraghan boys will srive a yearly
excursion to their oyster beds.
HAD A SPLENDID TIME
AT THE OYSTER BEDS
The good ship Germania, having outlived
her days of usefulness, is to be con
demned. The old craft has been a Tamlllar
sight in the bay for many years and is
now to be relegated to the graveyard of
many a-- fine vessel, namely, "the /lleet of
coal hulks." She was built in 1S50, at the
shipyard of Fernald & Pettigrew, in
Portsmouth, N. H. In 1S51, carrying 250
passengers, she made the trip from Havre
to New York In seventeen days, a record
never since equaled. She came around the
Horn thirty years ago and has been do
ing duty as a collier ever since.
In the flerc^ gale of nine years ago,
when the steam colliers Keewanaw and
Montserratt were lost with all hands on
board, the Germania weathered the
storm. Her last trip was out of this port
to Seattle and return, a few months ago.
and it Is a record to be proud of for a
vessel of fifty-one years' service that the
round trip was accomplished In twenty
seven days. Captain Rasmussen, who has
been the master of the Germania for the
past eight months, says he has never been
at sea'in a better sailer.
Transformation of Tug
The tug Millie, a useful craft around the
bay," Is undergoing a complete transforma
tion. She is to have her old style engines
removed and replaced by the latest Im
proved gasoline engine. About 1SS3 the
Millie was used In carrying- the daily pa
pers from San Francisco, but soon became
too slow. Her new engines will restore her
to a state of usefulness.
News of the Transports.
The last of the passengers and their
baggage were removed yesterday from the
Hancock, and to-day the remains of
thirty soldiers brought from Manila will
bo sent ashore. The Hancock made the
Voyage from Nagasaki to this port In
fourteen days, the fastest time on record.
When the Cclifornian leaves the dock the
Hancock will bo towed in.
The Sumner is expected to leave to
morrow. She has most of her cargo
aboard and is awaiting orders. It is ex
pected that she will carry 750 men of the
Fifteenth Infantry, now en route from
Plaltsville. N. Y.
It Is expected the Californian will start
on her maiden ' voyage to-morrow. Yes
terday stevedores were busily engag-ed in
stowing her hold with stores of all sorts.
She will carry in all close to 11,000 tons.

CHILD IS SCALDED TO
DEATH IN A WASHTUB
Little Harold Fritz Falls Into Boiling
Water Prepared for a
Footbath.
Little Harold Fritz, the 2-year-old child
of William and Mamie Fritz, residing at
27 Broadway, died at the Children's Hos
pital early yesterday morning. The death
of the little fellow was caused by his fall
ing into a tub of boiling water on Satur
day evening. At 7 o'clock Mrs. Fritz set
some water on the stove with the Inten
tion of taking a foot bath. When it was
boiling she set a washtub on the floor and
stepped into an adjoining room, while her
father-in-law poured the hot water into
the tub and left the room to get sufficient
cold water to make the temperature bear
able.
During the father-in-law's absence little
Fritz entered the room and fell into the
tub of scalding water. His cries at
tracted his mother's attention, and when
she reached the scene she found his head,
arms and chest under water. Dr. T. B.
Iceland was called in to attend the little
sufferer, and after dressing his burns he
had him sent to the Children's Hospital,
where he died at 3:30 yesterday morning.
The Coroner's office was notified and an
inquest will be held. The body was per
mitted to be moved to a private under
taker's pending the arrival of the child's
father, who is at present in Seattle work-
Ing at his trade as a butcher.
"The great pulpits of the world are
positive pulpits. They are pointing
toward the sunrise. Never before has
Christ been preached as now. Christ in
all his relations and aspects. He is the
Jiving theme cf the living pulpit." These
words sounurd the keynote ot Rev. Dr.
Jtader's vigorous sermon delivered to a
large congregation from the pulpit of the
Third Congregational Church .last night.
I The preacher made an eloquent and
orceful appeal tor an overthrow of an
icnt rusted dogmas.
â¢â¢You cannut warm a man's heart with
akos of ice," declared the speaker. "The
looern pulpit Is a force, an evangel of
ood news. \\ benever wrongs need re
resfinjr and humanity dofenaing there is
lie place of the pulpit."
The sermon entire was as follows:
"J have been making a. study of the
ulpit while listening to its message.
iniong the preachers to whom I have
KienÂ»*d are Canon Gore. Hugh Price
lughes, Joseph Parker, Alexander
Vhyte, Dr. Horton, Hugh Black. F. ii.
Lej-era of Great Britain, and such men
a Dr. Hillis and Lyman. Abbott of our
-wn country. What has been the rnes
s-afre of these men?
â¢'Kirsi â A reaction against sacerdotal
ism. TLe Church of England is the state
church, whoi-e Bishops sit In the House
cf Lores. The controversy waging be
tween the independent and established
church is at or.ce a political and ecclesias
tical one. It is a reaction again<t the
tacerdatol spirit, which is a tendency
toward pric-stcraft among the Anglicans.
I'rayir.g for the dead is one cf the ten
cencifs rebuked by the opposition.
"Secondâ Federation. Thi? is the nge
cf union. Combination is the spirit of the
timÂ«?s. There can never be metaphysical
or doctrinal union. Charles V attempted
to make Europe believe one creed. When
ifce attempted to make a number of clocks
tick in concert he saw his folly. It can't
be done. The churches will never tick
together doctrinally. but they may feder
ate for service. The greatest religious
force in Great Britain is the fedpratlon of
free churches, which meet annually, not
to discuss doctrine, but service. Why
should ministers preach co-operation for
others and practice competition them
selves? Broad-minded men occupy the
leading pulpits of the world, and only
tiroad-mir.ded m^n will be tolerated by a
thoughtful public
"Third â The pulpit is progressive
in the direction of a positive faith,
and awav from negative uncertain
ties. The pulpit is keeping pace
with the march of progress. Wa
have well-equipped battleships, ma
chinery. literatu:e. invention, a. new sci
encp, art and industry, so have we a new
pulpit. Its glory Is Us freedom. It is
(--peaking with a new voice. The mos3
is being' rubbfd ofiE the lids of th* Bible.
Men are preaching Jesus Christ. The note
rf liberal preaching is positive. The
church which denies is losing in the race.
The BU who-tells what ho does not know
Is not given a lar^e hearing. The great
pulpits of the world are positive pulpits.
They are frontine toward the sunrise.
Never before has Christ been preached as
now â Christ in all his relations and as
pects. He is the living theme of the liv
in? pu'pit.
"Fourthâ In America I found a strong
opposition against the Westminster stan j- i
srds of faith. These standards. once
adopted by Congr*-gationalists. are now
considered to b* the sole property of the
1'reebyterians. They are In doubt as to
â¢what disposition to make of them. When
a thing gets about so old it is placed in
a museum. That is where the AVestmi::
fter confession should go. It Is no longer
believed. End must disappear under the
light of new ideas of Clod, as certain as
the Chinese empire mus; go down before
Western ideas. The Westminster confes- I
Blon of faith is tho Chinese empire of i
modern theology. We must respect the I
men who Iraimxi it and honor those who J
have for many years adopted it as a doc
trinal charter, but the Presbyterians
themselves desire to lay aside the ex
hausted platitudes of this old and ho:i
<Â»r<?d banner of th*? church. Men like Dr.
Parkhurst. Dr. Van Dkye and Dr. Cuss- I
kr. and papers like the Interior urge a I
radical change of the Westminster con- I
Session.
'â¢Fifthâ The pulpit has more scope than
formerly. The circule of Us power hai
expanded. It is more diincult now to b>?
a preacher than fifty years ago. When
"Wendell Phillips occupied th<? pulpit of
Theodore rarker In Boston h*. said: 'It
was a live man spoaking to men alive on
nil live qustion?.' That is a good defini
tion of the pulpit of to-day. It is u
prophecy, a watch-tower, an rva.ngel cf
P"O<1 Dews, a fnrco, an instituton of right
eousness. Wherei'er wrongs need re
dressing and humanity defending, wher
ever men have fallen and need lilting up,
there is the place for the pulpit.
"Sixthâ The strong pulpits of Christen
dom are reinforced by a strong constituen
cy, by congregations and churches of pow
er. No pulpit stands alone. EvprÂ»; Mount
Shasta if buttressed by giant hills. No
Ftar in the sky but that shines in celestial
fellowship. The wave breaks upon the
Fhore. but it Is thrown out by a mighty
pulFe behind H. The pulpit is the wave,
the people are the ocf-an behind it. The
Ff>cret of great pulpits is found in the
pews. Good churches make stror.g
preachers, loyally, reverence, consistency,
unity of men. self-sacrifice, these In
spire the pulpits and kindle holy fire.<
upon the altars. You cannot build a lire
with icicles; you cannot warm a man's
heart with cakes of Ice. A great preachi r
!s a live nan. through whose lips a great
people speak."

singing at a fete given at the palace of

A stop of ten hours was made In Paris
in order that Mme. Melba. a lifelong
friend of Signora Repetto, might have
time to cross the channel from Dover
and bid her sister artist godspeed. Then
came Havre, where the steamer for New
Tork was boarded. The latter city was
reached last Sunday. Four hours after
the singers' arrival they boarded the
overland train, reaching San Francisco
four hours behind schedule time. A
freight wreck In New Mexico was re
sponsible for the delay.
SiR-nora Repetto comes hero -with he
European honors thick upon her. Th
lyric artiste has but recently closed i
triumphal tour which embraced Rome
Milan, Xaples, Berlin. â¢ Tiflls and St
Petersburg. Signora Repetto has a va
ried repertoire, and during- the comini
season will sing the leading roles in

of the University of Pennsylvania, after
seeming to be out of the long steeplechase,
made a magnificent spurt, beating an Eng
lishman, who looked a certain winner, the
enthusiasm was intense.

The first heat in the sixty metres fiat
went handily to Kraenzlein, with Mina
han of Georgetown University second and
Prltchard of the English team third. Time

oulous, Greek, took their places. Neither
of these could outstrip the puts made yes

14 mÂ«*:res and 10 centimetres, which is said
to beat tho world's record: McCracken

French Record Beaten.
Only three started in the final of the 400

letic Club refused to run to-day. This
left Maxwell Long of the N. Y. A. C,
William J. Holland of the University of
Georgetown and Schulz, Dane. At the

It well Into the stretch, where Long
caught him. The two had a great run to
the llnish, which Long reached one yard
in advance of Holland. Schulz being far
thest to the rear. Time 48 2-5 seconds,
beating the French record of 50 3-5.
In the discus throwing Sheldon out
stripped his Hungarian competitors, but,
as the records of the latter made in the
preliminaries stood in the finals, yester
day they did better. Bauer (Hungarian)
was first with 36 metres, 4 centimetres,
and Janda (Austrian) second, 35 metres,
14 centimetres, with Sheldon third. 34
â¢metres, 60 centimetres.
The 1500 metres flat race brought out

tained . his reputation, - winning with 190
centimetres. Leahy. (Irish) ; was second

PARIS, July 15.â Although deprived
of the services of some of her best
athletes, who declined to contest
in to-day's events of the world's
amateur championships in the
Bois de Boulogne, objecting to Sunday
competition, America won eight out of
ten of those decided, gaining live second
positions and four thirds.
One incident caused an unpleasant jar.
The terms of the agreement were reached
with the French officials at a joint meet
ing on Wednesday night. At that time It
was certainly understood by the Ameri
cans that the French had agreed that the
finals In the field events in which they
had entered, and which should come off
to-day, would be so arranged that the
Americans objecting to Sunday competi
tion could contest alone Monday and that
the records then made would bo counted
in reaching the final awards. Last night
the French decided that events set for to
day myst be concluded finally on the
grounds to-day, but that records made In
the preliminary trials yesterday would
stand.
This action was taken, It appears, on
the ground that tho other contestants ob
jected to such an advantage being given
the Americans. The decision was not
known to the Americans, and early in the
day some of the contestants, among them
Ba-'com Johnson of the New 'i ork Ath
letic Club and Charles Dvorack of the
University of Michigan, went to tho
grounds and were Informed that they
could contest Monday. On being so in
formed they went to their rooms. The
decision also operated against Prinsteln
of Syracuse University, who was pre
vented from competing to-day by the au
thorities of the college.
Protest of Americans.
A protest signed by all the American
teams has been presented to A. G. Spauld.
ing director of sports at the exposition,
against the change in the agreed arrange
ments However, as the Americans were
so successful some of the bad feeling dis
appeared. . ' 'Â¦.
In order to overcome the feeling caused
by Messrs. Johnson and Dvorack being
out of the pole vault event, the French
officials have agreed to offer a special
prize for a pole vault Thursday.
Kraenzleln of the University of Penn
sylvania, whom Prinstein beat yesterday,
to-day jumped in the .Â«nal of the broad
jump and won over Prinsteln's jump of
yesterday by a small margin. Each had
three Jumps yesterday, but Kraenzlein
had six- more to-day, -while Prinstein. al
though on the grounds, could not jump.
He entered a protest after the games.
The representatives of the University of
Pennsylvania had a large share in - to
day's winnings, and their contesting
caused some feeling among the other col
lege men. -
Weather conditions to-day were perfect.
The number of spectators .was much
larger than yesterday, and again tbe
PRESTO BEATS
AEOLUS BY A
WIDE MARGIN
Corinthian's Special Club
Regatta Was a Com
plete Success.
In the big boats' class the sloop Harpoon
crossed the finishing line first, but a pro
test made against her by the captain of the
sloop Mischief was allowed and the prize
went to the latter. The Harpoon, on. the
port tack near Arch Rock, had forced the
Mischief, on the starboard tack, to go
about, instead of yielding the right of way
to her. In the S6-foot class Vice Commo
dore E. F. Sagar's Edna took lirst place,
beating Short brothers' Emma by the nar
row margin of 25 secon<Is.
Among the 30-footers Â¦ Frank Stone's
Presto cam? in first and took first prize,
beating Wcetcrfield and Morrow's Aeolus
by nearly seven minute?. The prize in the
special class was won by the yawl Nereid.
In the 25-foot class the sloop Cupid beat
Commodore Hawks' May and the sloop
Phoenicia did not complete the course. In
the mosquito fleet J. M. Mattoon's racing
machine Doris II. imported last year from
the land of the Boxers, defeated the yawl
Kittiwake by a margin of nearly eight
minutes.
After the regatta Commodore Hawks
presented the flags won In the Decoration
day regatta and then the pewter mugs
to the winners in yesterday's races. In
each case the commodore accompanied
the presentation with a few appropriate
remarks, to which one or two of the re
cipients replied. The event was under the
management of the regatta committee of
the Corinthian Club, who did not announce
the cqurse until 10 o'clock yesterday morn

CORINTHIAN" YACHT CLVB SPECIAL. RE
GATTA, JUL.Y 15. 1S00.
The ppocial regatta of the Corinthian
Yacht Club yesterday was so much en
joyed by the members and their friends
that It will probably be made an annually
recurring event. Fifteen yachts started,
and all but two completed the course,
which was across a line drawn through
two- stakebeats anchored between the
clubhouse and the ferry slip, thence to
Arch Rock, leaving the same on the star
board; thence to the finishing line, pass
ing between the stakeboats. A decided
novelty was introduced in the start. At
the gun-fire for each class the crews of
the yachts in that class started from the
float in yawl boats, rowed out to the
yachts, made sail and got away from the
moorings. The yachts were divided into
six classes, as follows: 20-footers, 25-foot
ers, SO-footcrs, special class for yawls, 36
footcrs, and all over S6 feet. No time al
lowances were given and the start was
by the fire of a single gun.

The San Francisco Fly-Casting Club
held its ninth Sunday contest at Stow
Lake yesterday.
There was a very strong wind blowing
during the day. and added to this, a cold
fog made it very disagreeable for the par
ticipants. Despite these drawbacks quite
a number of members took part In the
different events and some very good
scores were made.
In the long-distance event Golcher cast
126 feet, securing first place; Lovell sec
ond, with 123Vfe feet: Brotherton third, with
121 feet. In the accuracy event Mansfield
secured 'first place, with 95 per cent:
Young second, with 92 4-12 per cent;
Everett third. 92 per cent. In the dellcacy

Then It is that they, spurred on by the
beauty banked up In the gallery overlook-
Ing the bay, smash records like so many
egg shells.
Early in the morning came the crowd
and it stayed until the last struggling
Dolphin fell gracefully eft the greasy pole
Into the "wet."
Inside the clubhouse the club flags and
the stars and stripes were draped artisti
cally round the walls. During the after
noon the members and their friends in
dulged in an impromptu dance upstairs
and kept it up until Tom Koleen took a
hand. The floor proved unequal to the
strain and after a tenor solo by William
O'Brien, Jerry Dillon, the "railroad king,"
President Fred Woerner and "Shorty"
Baker carried the piano downstairs and
the crowd followed. The floor was cleared
and Fred OConnell and "VV. O. Patch did
a cakewalk for a ham sandwich. Presi
dent Woerner and "Trixeda" Al Laid fol
lowed with a few graceful sand stunts.
Then Bert Vailler limbered up and did a
buck and wing that brought down the
house. This concluded the olio and the
audience filed out to watch "Mike" Ed
dy's new bathing suit do a slide for life
on the greasy pole.
The tub race brought out a number
Of the talent, but only two of them, J. D.
Farreli and A. W. Pape, made good. The
last named won easily, while Farreli re
volved and asked his iriends on the wharf
whether he was a merry-go-round or a
roulette wheel.
The old clothes swimming race proved
a popular event. Pape took off his vest
and thereby gained the prize. "Billy"
Ervine, Joe Erles and Tom Kennedy did
their best, but they were not in it for a
moment. Tom Ferguson had a "barrel"
of fun in the special gig race. He
doubled up with President Woerner to
make Elkin Coney and H. Perazzi look
like the crew of a beer schooner, but
something went wronjr and the Coney-
Perazzl craft gave the rival crew a chance
to show how their clothes fitted behind.
In the barge race, seniors against Juniors,
the beardless ones were badly beaten.
Pape and his fellow-patriarchs shoved
their furrowed brows and flowing beards
across the line several seconds, by Tom
Ferguson's watch," before the "kids" slid
over,
Wow! P,ut the crowd yelled when the
Dutch and Irish contestants In the great
barge race stepped out. The German crew
pot the new shell; and "the men that came
over" had the "half-shell," as T. R. Dixon,
with trunks of a vivid emerald hue, so
there would be no mistake about It, re
marked.
But it was no use. The Rhiners shot bv
like a runaway automobile, and the Irish
"also ran." To properly celebrate the close
of this race "Sousa" Pape, stiver cornet
in hand, lined up the "Dolphin sirens,"
consisting of Sid Cavlll with a stick,
"Verdi" Patch with a tuba, Joe Farreli
with another one. Robert Pheay with two
sections of a barrel and a coal oil can and
Billy Orndorff with a triangle. After play
ing "Fucrst Weinerwurst" in honor of the
winning crew, the band, protected from
assaults by a stronp bodyguard, escorted
both crews back to the clubhouse.

Â¦was finally brought to bay by Pabst. who
received a butt in the stomach that did
all the work. Then the pa me was delayed
for more air for "Beery" Pabst.
In the third Oakland sent a man over

Frar.cks died and the team went to the
benches.
The fcoro was poon tied. There was a
Ji!t by Jvrus and a sacrilice by Reilly. An
otfaer hit l>y Knell scored Kruer. That was
all thrre was in the way of run-gettir.g

Exciting and pretty was the play in the

of hits and pretty base-runnlr.g. A double
by Rfilly and a bit by Knell gave them
both a chance for pretty steals. Reilly on
third came home on Knell's steal of sec

local team untwisted him for fourteen
hits. The game was wnn in the eighth in
ning, when the scor^ was six all.
Kruc, Rellly and Fltzpatrick were
crowding the bags when Urockhoff came
to the plate. He did the proper thinpâ a
t wo-bapgerâ which cleared the bases and
made the score ? â 6 in favor of Frisco.
This was the Inning when Mr. Jones went
asunder, four hits being secured off his
delivery.
Fitzpatrick. who twirled for Hank's
team, was not such a strorp one yester
day. Ten hits was what the Dudes did
v.ith the t-tick, and two of them were
homers, or.c by diminutive Manirerlr.a, the

SEE-SAW GAME
WHICH GOES TO
HANK BY A RUN
At the great Faslg-Tipton sale, to bo
held in New York during the latter part
of August, the Spreckels stock farm of
Napa will offer twenty-eight head of tho
grandest bred yearlings that ever left this
State. In. past years the product of this
farm has been offered at auction in the
local market, but this season A. B.
Spreckels concluded to compete with the
breeders en the other side of the Rockies.
In all, twenty-eight head will be shippedâ
the get of imp. Ormonde, St. Carlo, tho
sire of the great Ruinart; imp. Crichton,
sire of Canace and other fast ones; Rav
elston, the wonderfully fast but unfor
tunate son of Flambeau; Eolo and tho
richly bred .English horse The Judge.
Of course the aristocratically bred
young miss by imp. Ormonde from imp.
Atossa, carrying in her veir.s four
crosses of the great Stockwell, will be tho
star of the sale. Alreudy a private bid or
J300O has been refused for the iilly, Mr.
Spreckels Insisting that she take chances
with the balance of the consignment.
Of the others it is hard to make a pick.
All have been broken but not tried, and
even now these embryo racers look ready
to answer the bugle call sounding post
time. There is a bay filly by Eolo-Annia
Race that will stand a lot of inspection.
Another rare looking filly by The Judge-
Llsta Hock catches the fancy of tho
critical. Perhaps the chestnut colt by
St. Carlo, claiming old Geraldino as his
'"mammv," will evoke some lively bid
ding. This sprightly fellow is the first
and last foal of California's favorite
sprinter, and now seems endowed with
tne speed of his maternal parent.
"With the back of a quarter horse, the
quarters of a Racine and legs that look
capable of standing all sorts of wear and
tear, a handsome cay filly by Ravelston-
Lady Cleveland, dam of Catalus. looks all
over a winner. She has driving power
behind like a stern-wheeler and the ranch
hands predict big. things for the young
ster. A black colt by General Miles-
Tragic looks good, and a finely furnishfil
bay colt by General Miles trom .Nellie
Bell, dam of Canace, will assuredly bring
a swell price, if looks and actions counc
for anything. The royally bred Marcello
is represented for the first time at public
sale by a statuesquely turned colt by
Eolo, racy looking enough to suit the most
fastidious buyer. Cut down in the zenith,
of her career, Alma Dale has a bay
daughter by St. Carlo that looks all over
a stake winner. Of the others that will
be led into the sales ring nothtng but
praise can be said, and looks will speak
louder than any words that can now bo
wasted on them.
The youngsters will be Bhlpped from
Napa stock farm on August V> under tho
supervision of Tom Cook, the elongated
trainer, who once dared to claim one of
Corrigan's horses, and has since been oa
the -waiting list.
One of the very pleasant features of tho
Napa fair race meeting was the work
performed In the starter's box by
"Farmer" Berry. His skill with the elas
tic starting machine caused the native*
to open their eyes, and the "Farmer" will
undoubtedly poll a big vote next election
for whichever office he chooses to run for.
Zick Abrams spent a very pleasant week
at Napa. but laid away very little coin.
As about fourteen out of eighteen favor
ites won, Henry Nathan did nothing but
deal out winning pasteboards.
From all accounts, the California book
making contingent are faring badly in the
East. Joe llarlan recently wrote out for
more coin, and the fate* are treating
Johnny Coleman and George Rose none
t Â°At kl th d e > Napa fair imp. Crichton took
first prize in the thoroughbred stallion
class, while Libertine took second honors.
For the first prize in the thoroughbred
family clas3. Straight Tip. with two colts
by Puryear D, was awarded the blue rib
bon. A. B. Spreckela carried off first prizo
for the finest road team, the handsome
chestnuts being handled to perfection by
the noted local whip Grove Ayers.

The third and most common defect is
astigmatism. In this condition there Is
f-ome Irregularity of thÂ» surface of the
ey P or of the lens, by means of which the
lmas:^ ss it reaches the retina Is distorted.
1'ntreated- astigmatism Is a frequent
cause of headache and other nervous
disturbances. The only relief is the wear-
Ing of glasses, at least while reading,
writing 1 or whenever near objects are
looked at.
Ir. this case the eye often corrects the
defect more cr less successfully by mak
ing the crystalling' lens more convex, but
It does this at the expense of the suffer
er's nervous force, and so we often find
tired and congested eyes, headaches, in
digestion and even ceriou3 nervous affec
tions. The effort to correct the vision Is
entirely Involuntary, and can be over
come orAy by the fitting of suitable or
convex glasses.
A less common defect Is long or far
sightedness, or hypermetropia. This is
the opposite of myepia, the eyeball being
flattened or shortened, and the rays of
light consequently not coming to a focus
by the time they reach the retina.
Many near-sighted people refuse to wear
glasses, preferring to deprive themselve-s
of sight for e-ve-rything' beyond the nose
rather than to injure their personal ap
peanfnee. as they think. This is another
short-sighted policy, for. besides losing
much of the Joy cf existence, which comes
frcm seeing the be-autiful things about
and above us. such persons are very liable
to suffer from Inflammation of the eyes,
produced by constant strain.
This condition may exist from birth, but
Is usually the result of too murh and too
early use of the eyes, as In the case of
Ftudents. engravers, women who do fine
Bewinr, etc. Thus we may say that put
ting children to work at some of the kin
dergarten exercises, such as perforating
and drawing, is in a double sense a short
sighted proceeding.
Near-sightedness, short-sightedness, or
myopia, as it Is variously called, i3 a con
dition of the eyeballâ usually a length
eningâin consequence of which the rays
of light are brought to a focus In front of
the retina, and so the object Is blurred.
The three defects of eyesight which are
most commonly encountered in otherwise
healthy persons, and which can be more
or less perfectly overcome by means of
glasses, are near-sightedness, far-sight

Important, for. besides thp discomfort and

Meantime the Territory had drifted Into
a state of anarchy and desultory war
fare. One may feel surprised that, con
sidering the inflammable state of affairs,
violence and t>loo<IshÂ»<] were so long
avoided, but the year 1S36 was memorable
for the great suffering endured by the
people of Kansa?. The two governments
and their supporters were mutually re
sisting and disobeying each other. As
sassination, murder and Incendiarism on
the part of the "border ruffians" were an
swered by similar deeds by the free-soll
ers. It is not necessary to say to which
party belongs the greater guilt. The most
violent passions were aroused and acts of
cruelty and barbarism on one side or the
other wera of frwjuent occurrence. The
insecurity of life and property spread ter-
Civil War in Kansas.
The Topeka Constitution.
Under such a government there was no
place for the Northern immigrants with
anti-slavery sentiments, and the free
state men took immediate steps to have
Kansas admitted as a State, without
waiting for an enabling act of Congress.
Such lack of formality was not unpre
cedented. California had come in thus,
and Â«o had otner Territories. A constitu
tional convention, attended only by the
iree-State settlers, met at Topeka in Oc
tober 1S53. and formulated a State con
stitution which prohibited slavery. This,
having been submitted to popular vote,
was adopted by the free-State party, the
pro-slavery party Ignoring the whole pro
ceeding. A Legislature, a full set ot State
officers and a representative to Consress
were also elected, and Kansas applied to
Congress for admission. A uill admitting
the new State, with the Topeka constitu
tion passed the House of Representatives,
but was rejected by the Senate. From the
territorial government which President
Pierce was determined to maintain
Kansas free-State settlers could expect
only persecution: a government they murt
have, and what better could they do than
to stand by that which they had estab
lished, even though it was refused Federal
sanction by the partisan administration
at Washington? So the State Legislature
met in July. 1S36. only to be dispersed by
Federal soldiers, acting under orders
from Washington.- President Pierce had
pledged "the internosition of the whole
power of the general government as well
to maintain the laws of the Territory as
tnose of the Union."
After repeated failures to put the Free
State government into the last
effort in January. 1S3T. having been
brought to naught by the arrest of the
members of the Legislature- by Federal
officers â the Toneka constitution was
finally abandoned.
Kansas then was to be slave or free, as
"popular sovereignty" should determine.
Pro-Â«lavery Immigrants were first in the
field and were able to elect the first dele
gate to Congress in 1S54. The first Federal
Governor, Keeder. a pro-slavery Demo
crat arrived soon after and ordered an
election for a Legislature. This took place
in March, 1Â£55. The census taken the
month before reported nearly 3000 legal
voters in the Territory, but the election
returns showed 54C7 votes cast for the pro
slavery candidates and 791 for others.
Large bands of men crossed the Missouri
line on elcetlon day, voted and returned
to Missouri by night. The free-State Im
migrants, who had been coming in larger
and larger bands for actual settlement
since the summer of 1S54. naturally de
clined to recognize a legislative body so
chosen. But the forces of slavery, sup
ported by the Federal administration at
Washington, held their advantage and
persisted in casting the color of lawless
ness upon every act of the free-soil set
tlers, whom they constantly charged with
resistance to "the constituted authorities"
of the Territory.
The Legislature took extreme pro-slavery
measures, adopting all Missouri's slave
laws and adding some fifty statutes, im
posing the death penalty for offenses
against slavery and requiring every of
ficer, candidate, judge and voter (if chal
lenged) to take oath to support the fugi
tive slave law.
The First Territorial Government.
To the North, on the other hand, a great
moral question was at stake. Slavery wa3
a sin, a moral cancer sapping the nation's
life. To check its further spread was the
first duty of every man who loved his
country and believed in the law of right
eousness. By the Missouri compromise
the nation had been committed to a re
strictive policy. The Kansas-Nebraska
act, which repealed that compromise, had
violated the nation's pledge and handed
over to slavery soil made sacred to free
dom. Nothing could be hoped from pro
slavery politicians. Double-dealing, trick
ery arid falsehood had characterized their
course. The time had now come when
every possible effort must be made to ren
der effective the moral earnestness, the
self-sacrificing love of freedom and of
country which had swept through the
North like a prairie fire at this latea vio
lation of political good faith.
Compromise was no longer possible, the
nation s death struggle was at hand and
for it the Kansas dispute cleared the way
and marshaled the opposing forces.
fare. Kansas lest meant the perpetuation
of Southern industrial inferiority, loss ol
numerical superiority In the Senate and
the unendurable political supremacy of thÂ«
overbearing Yankee.
Democratic action had precipitated the
contest between freedom and slavery in
Kansas, and for years the hand-to-hand
contest with ballots or with rifles upon the
Western prairies was matched by the
forensic battle in the legislative halls at
Washington. One-sided as the question
may seem to Northern view, it cannot be
denied that there was a real and earnest
conviction upon the side of slavery also.
The Southerners felt with growing bitter
ness that the North was constantly tak
ing unfair advantages. They saw them
selves shut out from the steady march of
prosperity by which the Northern States
were growing rich and strong. They saw
State after State admitted to the Union
with constitutions forbidding slavery after
Texas, the last slave State, had come in.
A generation had grown up honestly be
lieving that the system of slavery pos
sessed all moral and constitutional sanc
tions, and that the Northern opposition
was unjust, illegal, bigoted and utterly in
tolerable. They understood that by the
passage of the Kansas-Nebraska act Kan
sas had been legally dedicated to slavery,
and that the fanatical anti-slavery immi
grants and their supporters were plotting
to wrest from the South by fraud and
guile that which was rightly hers. Almost
any means of frustrating this nefarious
scheme seemed Justifiable in the extreme
danger which threatened Southern wel-
The Opposing Views.
Archbishop Chapelle has taken no un
certain stand on the question of the friars
which the Filipino people resard as the
keynote of all their troubles. The Arch
bishop has expressed his opinions freely
to many officers and civilians with whom
he has talked, although he declines to
give any formal Interviews for publica
tion. His conclusions summarized are
these: That the Filipinos owe to the
monastic brotherhoods all the education
and civilization they possess. That It
would be a great injustice to the friars to
expel them from the field wherein they
have worked for centuries, or to deprive
them of the estates which they have ac
quired honestly and have administered for
the public good. That it would be im
possible to replace them with other priests
because there is no other clerical force
acquainted with the country and the lan
guages of the people, and . the Filipino
priests are not competent to hold any but
the subordinate positions In the church.
That the opposition to the friars Is an
artificial propaganda fostered by the in
surgents and by the Filipino priests, who
are themselves leaders in the Insurrection
and are using It to obtain control of the
church in the islands.
In the circular he refers to news com
ing to him of brilliant victories in the
south, and concludes with an exhortation
to the soldiers to spend fewer cartridges
and bring many defeats to the enemy.
"Dear Brothers â I need not explain whv
on the 6th day of March I started from
this unforgettable land of the province of
llocos. Perhaps a good star has guided
me between the mountains in order that
I mav breathe the purer air of this prov
ince. Proceeding from a point not un
known to you where for the first time I
received the severe blow of the surrender
of two of our generals with all their
forces (referring to the commanders at
Aparri and Bayombong). a blow that as
you can suppose has roused in me a pro
found depression both physical and men
tal. I resolved to abandon such sad spots
and seek a place which will bring me hap
piness."
Proclamation by Aguinaldo.
The "presidencia" in which Aguinaldo
spent two months at Laboagan was an
ordinary bamboo house such as ihe peas
ants live in. According to Colonel Sal
azar's diary the plates which the Filipino
leader used were made of banana leaves,
and the furniture of bamboo. Salazar
wrote that when "the Honorable Pres
ident" received the news that General
â¢Tinio was to visit him "he could not
sleep from happiness." He received Tinio
with military honors, and music by a
band consisting of one cane flute and a
few bamboo instruments, and decorated
tho-presidencia with flowers. In a cir
cular addressed to the officers of the Fili
pino army and dated Laboagan, April 14,
Aguinaldo said:
Archbishop Chapelle Is a supporter of
the idea. He believes that the policy of
leniency is wasted upon Asiatics, who fail
to comprehend the motives for It. To the
American officers with whom he has talked
the Archbishop ha? said that the heads ot
the leaders should be cut ofT. There is lit

of his prisoners whom he considered the
most dangerous characters. General Otis
had no use for them, but reloaded them
on the steamer and sent them back north,
where they were disembarked to follow
their own wills. Most of them soon drift
ed back Into the insurgent camps.
Some of the American generals think
that the insurrection could be materially
crippled by the establishment of a St.

them to some island where they could not

Correspondence of the Associated Press.
MANILA, June 12.â "More soldiers" is
the demand which is coming to General
MacArthur from every department of the
islands. Recent events have worked to
vindicate General Lawton's judgment
that 100,000 troops would be needed to es
tablish American sovereignty over the
Philippines. Until they attempted to hold
provinces of two or three hundred thou
sand hostile people with a regiment or
two the American commanders hardly re
alized the size of the Philippine Islands.
The present force Is not large enough
to garrison more than half of the impor
tant towns, and in some of the most im
portant islands, among them Cebu, Pa
nay, Samar, Leyte and the great Moham
medan empire of Mindanao, only the com
mercial ports were occupied.
The Moros are a cloud on the horizon.
The officers best acquainted with condi
tions in Mindanao and theSulu islands de
clare that they consider fighting there
Inevitable. If It comes, the two regiments
which are scattered in small garrisons,
some of them hundreds of miles apart
along the coast of Mindanao, an island
nearly as large as Luzon, may have seri
ous Â¦work. The Jloroa are fighters by na
ture, do not fear death, have many guns,
though of antiquated make, but do the
best execution by lying in the thick jun
gles and cutting down soldiers who pass
through with their terrible krlses and
ppears.
Work Before Young.
General Youngr, who is holding seven of
the most mountainous provinces of I-iU
zon with four regiments, expects severe
work during the rainy season. For two
months, after his bewildering invasion
of the north In December, the insurgents
were paralyzed. With enough troops to
keep ?n eye on the villages and prevent
reconcentratior.. the paralysis, the gen
eral b<?lle\-ps. might have been made per
manent. Finding ample opportunities to
reorganize, the insurgents have availed
themselves of the chance. Young's troops
have worn themselves and their horses
down to the limit of endurance in march-
Ing about the mountain trails, striking
the Filipinos wherever they couid get the
track of an organized band. Hundreds
have been slain, but much of the work
has been like brushing away mosquitoes
which swarm down upon a new spot.
General Tinio has a nomadic command
whose warriors can hide their guns and
become "amlgos" if it suits their Inter
ests. As few of them wear uniforms and
the people combine to shield them from
detection the Americans are greatly hand
icapped. The church has become a trou
blesome factor In Young's territory. Agli
pay. the priest who has proclaimed him
self Archbishop of the Philippines and ex
communicated Archbishop Nosaleda, is in
the field as a general. His? forces attacked
Captain Dodd's of the Third Cavalry at
Â¦ Batoc. when more than two hundred Fili
pinos were slain. Aglipay commanded in
person, and there Is an unproven report
that he was among the killed. His fol
lowers fought with the recklessness of
Mohammedan fanatics. They approached
the Americans in three linesâ an advance
guard of women, arranged with the.ex
pectation that the Americans would not
tire upon them; after the women a line of
bolomen, and ethers armed only with
wooden swords, no more dangerous than
policemen's clubs; behind the bolomen
come the riflemen. Happily the women
threw themselves fiat upon the ground and
sought shelter at the first fire, so that few
of them were Injured. The soldiers thought
they were men disguised in women's
clothes. The onslaught of the bolomen
was like the descent of the Mahdi's fanat
ics upon Kitchener's sauare at Khartoum.
They kept coming on faster than the sol
diers could shoot them down, until they
were so close that our cavalrymen had not
time to fire and load, but went through
them with clubbed carbines.

The bruins on the course was heavy. In
the previous round Flying Fox had a long
course, and in view of this the bettors
made "Warship a strong favorite. He
opened at 5 to 1, ar.d as good as 3 to 1 on
was offered. After the course it was evi

Dr. Zabriskie. who Is the family physi
cian for the Mayers, was summoned by
the Mayor cop.chman at 5 o'clock Friday
afternoon. Commander WlnslOW met the
doctor at the dnor and led him upstairs
to Mrs. Mayer's bedroom. where thÂ«
wounded woman was lying upon her back
on the floor. Examination of the wound
disclosed that the bullet entered her left
hreaet just below the heart and passed
under that organ anÂ«l out of the body at
the back, beneath the shoulder blade. A
bit of lead was picked up in a corner of
the room, whnre it had fallen. Two con
sultations of physicians were held. It was
decided that r.o operation would avail.
Mrs. Mayer died with many relatives
about her bedside.
"I understand that Mr. Window said to
one of the members of the family that he
would have somebdy before the Coroner
who would testify that Mrs ;> Mayer said
she accidentally shot herself."
It was on Friday afternoon, twenty-four
hours before the" time of Mrs. Mayer's
death, that the shot was tired. Command
Â«?r Winslow's statement does not even tell
who hold the weapon. On this point, how
ever. Dr. Albert Zabriskie. the first phy
sician to be called after Mrs. Mayer was
hurt, said:
"Mrs. Mayer died from the effect of a
pistol shot, accidentally fired. The wound
was not at first believed to be fatal. There
will be a Coroner's inquest, in accordance
with the law."
NEW YORK, July 13.â Mrs. Natalie
Mayer, wife of John >!ayer and eldest
daughter of the late Theodore Have
meyer, died in the Mayer mansion on
Mountainside Farm, near Rahway, X. J.,
late Saturday afternoon. Little definite
news was known concerning the cause of
death until to-day, when Commander
Wlnslow, U. S. N.. who is married to a
p!?ter of Mrs. Mayer, gave out the follow
ing statement:
Was a Daughter of the Late Theodore
Havezneyer and Related by Mar
riagfe to Commander Wins

the windows were demolished. There were
four passengers on the car. two of whom,
Edward English and Mollie Shez. were so
badly injured that they had to be taken

RELIANCE NINE WINS
FROM THE HEESEMANS
OAKLAND. July 15.â The Contra
Costa Water Company has refused
the experts of the city of Oakland
permission to examine the stock
ledger of the company. This is one of the
books that the experts for the city de
sired very much to examine. It is one of
the books that Is In existence, and which
can be feen if the officials of the Contra
Costa Water Company choose to allow It.
But the permission, which was requested
yesterday, was refused upon the ground
that the permission of Judge Hart did
not allow the examination of that partic
ular book, and the company could not and
would not go beyond the scope of the
legal order.
So the gilding finally has been complete
ly rubbed off of the order granting the
city permission to examine the corpor
ation's books. The last scrap of the gold
plate is destroyed, and the representatives
of the city of Oakland find themselves
with permission to examine only some
books that do not exist, and which long
ago went up in smoke from the pipe yard
of the Contra Costa Water Company.
'Exactly why the officials of the Contra
Costa "Water Company refused the city
experts the permission to examine this
particular book Is not exactly apparent.
The book contains a list of the stockhold
ers of the company and a list of the trans
fers up to date, or such as have been
made on the books of the company. It
would show the floating stock is in the
name of "Trustees," but would not show
the actual owner thereof. If -the expert*
for the city hoped to find any suspicious
stock transfers they would have to look
beyond this book, and It Is not likely that
such careful custodians of books and
records as the managers of the Contra
Costa Water Company would allow thiÂ»
information to escape If it was detri
mental to their- Interests.-
The failure of the city experts to se-
cure any Information from the books of
the water company as to the original cost
of the works has reduced the proposition
of a valuation of the plant to an engineer
ing question. It will now be necessary
for both sides to put their engineers at
work upon the plant and estimate its
value by figuring the cost of replacing it.
This was done by the City Council fif
teen years ago. The City Council was
then engaged in a controversy over the
valuation of the plant of the old Contra
Costa Water Company. The Council
employed L. J. Le Conte as Its special en
glneeryto make an estimate. The Contra
Costa Water Company also employed an
engineer and the reports of the two ex
perts came within less.- than 5230,000 of
each other. Ever since that time this
valuation has been adopted as the valu
ation of the water plant, with the better
ments added. â¢ â¢
But one day the report of Engineer LÂ«
Conte disappeared from the records of the
city of Oakland, and the report has been
missing ever since that time. r \ â¢

ror throughout the settlements. Thia
lawlessness, which drenched the borders
of unhappy Kansas with blood, was quite
other than the rudeness ar.d lawlessness
common to frontier communities, and far
more serious, more ominous, for it was
based upon profound moral and political
convictions, upon settled and intense de
termination. With good reason the at
tention of the whole country was concen
trated upon Kansas. Thoughtful men
looked with foreboding into the future.
It was a period of great discouragement
to the Northern immigrants. Every sort
of power seemed to be in the hands of
their enemies, by whom they were dally
insulted and abused. Lawrence, which
had become the headquarters for the Free
State forces, was threatened by a pro
slavery mob in the fall of 1S55. and act
ually sacked and burned the following
spring. In fanaticu! retaliation John
Brown and his followers murdered five
pro-slavery settlers and the contest was
thus made more bitter and desperate.
There was, however, on the part of the
anti-slavery settlers no thought of. aban
doning the struggle, though men came to
realize with what a great price was free
dom to be won for Kansas. The stream
of Northern immigration grew smaller,
but it was not checked, and every com
pany now came equipped with Sharpe's
rifles. The North b^gan to cast up her
resources. An article in the Springfield,
Mass.. Republican contained these lines:
"We can perceive no reason why we oi
the North should appropriate to our
selves the whole terror and dread of
war. We cannot teil why the wholo
weight of Its heaviest strokes will be for
us, albeit our Southern friends evidently
so regard it. AVe have more charcoal
than they have; we have more saltpeter;
we have more brimstone; we have more
lead; we have more bone, and blood, and
nerve, and muscle. Will they have a trial
by these? Are they ready for it? Are
they eater for the clinch .of death? 'Lee
them beware!"
In this spirit the struggle went on. F^r
every fret-State man slaughtered for his
faith a score of free-State men equally
earnest and more sternly resolved stepped
over the border.
There were good reasons, foreseen from
the first by wist men of the North,
why in a continued contest between free
dom and slavery, ba^ed upon immigra
tion, freedom had the great advantage.
To make Kansas a slave Stilt** there must
be slaves and slave-holders there. Now.
a slave was a very valuable piece of
property and his owner was likely to bÂ«
slow about taking him to a part of
the country where it was altogether possi
ble that he might cease to be property
and become a person. Property ia pro
verbially timid, and no property h3d so
good reson for timidity in Kansas ad
slave property. Even when a Southern
planter had determined to sell his estate
ar.d remove with his slaves to aid in pre
empting the new Territory for the bene
ficent institution, surh a transfer was a.
matter of time â often much tlmÂ». Then,
the plan for sending to Kansas Southern
men who were not hampered by slave
ownership was not one to command uni
versal confidence. Pro-slavery men with
out slaves had been known to become
strong opponents of slavery under cer
tain conditions. The South had had great
experience of that in the case of Califor
nia. Moreover, the loose rabble of th"Â»
baser sort, such as the border ruffians of
Missouri, despite their ferocious temper
and adventurous spirit, could not be de
pended upon to win In the long, steady,
unyielding fight to the death for home
and right and country which the con
vinced anti-slavery man was ready to
enter upon.
On the other hand, large numbers of
trained, successful business men in tho
North were able quickly to transfer their
interests to a new locality. Farmers, me
chanics, merchants could follow their
calling's In the new settlement, and thera
was an abundance of eager young man
hood seeking avenues to fortune and use
fulness for whom Kansas offered an at
tractive field. And so the Free State pop
ulation grained steadily over that from tnÂ«
South, and by the end of the year ISitJ
the New England Emigrant Aid Society
felt that Its work was done. Its battle
won. There were four men for freedara
in Kansas to every one for slavery.

COUNTY LEITRIM CLUB'S
TENTH ANNUAL PICNIC
WILLIAM H. HALLETT.
N'OTHER local favorite in the person
|1 of William H. Hallett has come
1^ under the admirlnff gaze of William
I * H. West, the minstrel manager, by
* whom he has been engaged. Mr.
Hallett left yesterday for New York,
where he will join West's company as
principal barytone singer.
"When the troupe was in this city recent
ly "West "tried out" Hallett's voice and
after hearing him sing several ballads,
entered into a contract for the opening of
a new season in the latter, part of this
month.
Hallett started out on his professional
career three years ago and has appeared
with five different companies during that
time, always scoring a hit. He possesses
a barytone voice of resonant quality and
has a number of fine selections in his
repertoire. ;i Â¦ â¢ v ; ; . r. â¢ .
Mr. Hallett Â¦was for many years a well
known local amateur. He made his first
appearance with the Strathmore Quartet
some ten years ago. He was a capable in
terlocutor at many minstrel shows given
under the auspices of the Olympic Club
and other organizations. He Is the son
of Captain George H. Hallett, who is
connected with the administrative staff of
the Palace Hotel.
Two Hundred Men and Eight Officers
Return to Recruit Up the
Regiment at the
Front.
The home, battalion of the Eighteenth
Infantry disembarked from the transport
Hancock yesterday and went Into camp
at the Presidio just by the Lombard
street entrance.
There are lour companies to the bat
talion, but they are only skeleton organ
izations. Altogether there are not more
than two hundred men. The battalion is
made up of the unavailable men from the
other companies of the regimentâ the men
who have but a short time to serve, and
officers and non-commissioned officers
sufficient to make up the outline of the
organization. Tho battalion is command
ed by a captain, and seven other officers
make up the commissioned complement.
The home battalion of the Eighteenth
is destined for Fort Kehoe, Montana, a
post practically as far away from civili
zation as the Philippines. It is one of the
theories of the home battalion system
that the battalion sent home will recruit
up the remainder of the regiment, but it
la little recruiting the home battalion of
the Eighteenth will do up in the "bad
lands" of Montana. For that reason it is
expected that while the present assign
ment is to Fort Kehoe, it will be changed
before the regiment arrives there, or the
assignment will be but for a short time.
The officers and the men are not par
ticularly pleased with the prospect, but
they take matters philosophically and
wonder only how long it will be before
they will start for their new home.
The luck of the Eighteenth has not been
up to the standard, for It has drawn hard
pos<..i since '71. In '71 It left the South,
where it had been stationed with head
quarters at Atlanta and companies at
surrounding posts, to take station in Mon
tana. It was there for a great many
years and then was sent to Texas. It
was in Texas for nine years, and then at
the outbreak of the Spanish war the regi
ment was started for Cuba. It got no
farther than New Orleans, for when it
reached there orders to hold It were re
ceived, and after seven weeks of lnacti%-
ity it was sent to the Philippines. It went
out in tho Second expedition and has been
in service In tho Islands for twenty-five
months. It was through the Spanish end
of the war in l^uzon and has put in the
remainder of the time in subduing the
Insurrection in the surrounding islands.
The home battalion is In command of
Captain Edson A. Lewis. First Lieutenant
Harold 13. Fiake is adjutant and the other
officers are First Lieutenant Elmer W.
Clark. First Lieutenant Murray Baldwin,
First Lieutenant Albert S. Brooks, First
Lieutenant William H. Jordan and Sec- I
ond Lieutenant Oliver S. Eskrldge. i

EIGHTEENTH'S
HOME BATTALION
GOES INTO CAMP
Rev. "William P. Chalfant, the mission
ary just returned from China, reiterated
in an address last night at the Calvary
Presbyterian Church his declaration that
had the foreign Ministers at Peking given
heed for the past two years to the warn
ings and appeals of the missionaries scat
tered throughout the provinces the anti
foreign movement could have been sup
pressed and the terrible events of the last
month been averted. He said that United
States Minister Conger, good man and
able dinlomat though he was, listened to
the Tsung-li Yamen, the Chinese Foreign
Office, instead of the nriepionaries, and
had very probably paid tho penalty of his
Rev. Mr. Chalfant has spent fifteen
years in missionary work in China, lie
has been stationed for several years past
at lchow Fu, in the North China province
of Shantung, a province which has 30,000,
000 people and 13,000 native Christians.
The subject of his s-ermon was "The Sit
uation in China." He spoke in part as
follows:
"As I stand here to-night and realize
that I am in my native land again my
thoughts so back to our little adobe
church in lchow Fu, where I so many
times stood behind the little table and
broke the bread of life to the dear ones
there. For they were dear to me. God
only know? where they are to-night.
"Kive years aaro things seemed bright
and hopeful in China. The young Emperor
had ascended the throne and gathered
around him progressive young men. Many
reforms were Instituted.
"In 1SS7 two German priests -were mur
dered. The German Emperor sent vessels
and men and seized the pdYt of Tsung-
Tau. The conseivative party grew reslve.
They a^ked. 'Why did not Germany seek
indemnity through the usuaj channels?'
Then came the plot against the Dowager
Empress, which was thwarted, and the
young Emperor was seized and a reign
of terror began.
"Instantly the effect was felt throughout
China. Those who had been anxious to
learn from the foreigners, though not in
the least interested in Christianity, no
longer came to the missions. Attacks and
outrages on missionaries were frequent.
Ordinarily the Chinaman is docile, but
when his worst passions are- aroused he
is a fiend inearnnte.
"Minister Conger was appealed to. He
is an able man, but rather conservative,
and he could not believe that things were
so serious as the missionaries represented
them. He went to the Tsung-li Yamen
and they said there had been no outbreaks
In the Shantung province, and he believed
them. Those earlier outrages were ex
perimental, as it were, and after waiting
to 5ee the effect the Boxers entered upon
more serious work.
"There Is no doubt of the sympathy of
the Government with the Boxer move
ment and of the aid given the Boxers by
the imperial troops.
"Had the foreign Ministers given/ hoed
to the warnings with which the mission
aries fairly bombarded them during two
year? the whole trouble could have been
avoided.
"The missionaries of the Shantung pro
vince are all safe.' At Peking there is
that terrible silence, and I fear the worst.
It is Incredible that so lonp a time could
have elapsed with no word from the lega
tions if the members had not all been
murdered."
Rev. William P. Chalfant Again
Charges the Foreign Ministers
"With an Ultra-Conserva
tive Policy.
Minister Conger Listened to
the Tsung-Li Yamen

AT THE THEATERS
THE Dunne and Ryleys are disporting
themselves this week "At Gay Coney
Island." and the California Theater
was packed last night to witness the
performance.
Of course, there is nothing to say of the
play. The title labels it, and those who
will look upon Coney Island when it is gay
know Just what they are gettingâ and de
serve all of it. It goes with a rush and a
swing all through, with a "patent, double
million, back-action" swiftness, as Sam
Weller would say. Mathews and Bulger
have a tremendously funny specialty. In
the last act Tony Hart as the musical
grocer is delightful, and Phil Ryley make3
an excellent medicine man.
Miss Maud Courf*ney, who was on the
programme as Daisy Kidder, was taken
sick Just before the performance and it
was necessary to substitute Miss Adlyn
Kstee. who had never studied the part.
Miss Kstee had to read her lines? 1 Every
thing will go smoothly In this part to
night. . " .'
Miss Xorma Whalley. the new leading
lady, also appears. She made a fairly
good Delia "Ware and is certainly one of
the handsomest women on the stage.
Mary Marble is enjoyable, as usual, and
Miss Tannehlll as Mrs. Payne did good
work. The eight mascots have a very
clever and pretty though not new sp-Cialty
â¢In a skipping-rope dance.

Miss Lillian Burkhart is again at the
Orpneum this week in a new "costume
playlet," "Captain Suzanne." This Or
pheum favorite was warmly welcomed,
arid the nevr play, in which Miss Burk
hart dons tights â an incidental of a sol
dier's costumeâ and becomes them, seems
to be a success. There Is a fencing scene,
in which Captain Suzanneâ Miss Burkhart
â does some pretty work, and she is fairly
well supported by Mr. Brewer and Mr.
Leach. V Â¦
Clayton "White and Marie Stuart, the
Quaker City Quartet and Barrere and
Jules are among the holdovers and bid
fair to rival other long runs lately fash
ionable among the vaudevillalns. Smith
and Fuller's musical , novelties, one of
which is a. solo upon tomato cans â very
good but rather "tinny" in tone â were
very well received. John Donahue and
Miss Mattle Nichols furnish a clever and
original song and dance, and Stella May
hew, the negro Impersonator, and Wil
liamson and Stone, the blackface come
dians, add their quota to the evening's
fun.

THE tenth session of the Grand Coun
cil of the Young Ladles' Institute,
which closed Saturday night, was
marked by changes of much Import
ance in the construction of the organiza
tion and by the enthusiasm manifested
by the delegates. The officers and leading
members confidently expect to see a
greater growth in the next two years than
any two years in the past have brought.
By one amendment to the constitution,
each branch will be allowed a delegate at
large to the Grand Council, and one for
every fifty members. In the past there
has been no delegate at large. It is
thought the change, increasing the num
ber of delegates, will increase interest
among the smaller branches of the Insti
tute. The offlce of grand marshal was
made elective instead of appointive, and
the offices of grand secretary and grand
treasurer were combined. By another
amendment the restriction of the branches
to five honorary members was removed.
By vote of the Grand Council, the grand
president. Miss Annie M. Pothoff, was
instructed to appoint two historians. She
has named Miss Ella Comyns of Branch
No. 3 and Miss Helen "Winters of Branch
No. 2.
The retiring grand president, Mrs. Mary
Nagle, named Miss Potthoff as chairman
of a committee to consider the adoption ot
a new form of regalia. Miss Potthoff will
appoint two other members.
"The Grand Council just closed," said
Miss Josephine Molloy , the grand secretary
and treasurer, last evening, "was pro
ductive of more pood, we all feel, than
any ever held before. There was more of
goodfellowshlp and the delegates all went
home full of enthusiasm and determined
that the Institute shall double In member
ship before the next Grand Council."
"We are particularly proud," said Mrs.
Mary Nagle, past grand president, "of the
changes made In the constitution. As It
now stands we think It Is an almpst per
fect instrument."
THBEE NEWIiY ELECTED GRAND OFFICERS OF THE YOUNG LADIES' INSTITUTE.
A man whose Identity has not yet been
ratisfactorlly determined, but whose
r.ame was supposed to be Curley or Hur-
Ir-y, died at the City and County Hospi
tal yesterday morning as the result of in
juries received several days ago. but
vheth* r accidentally or not the police do
not know. There seems to b<? consider
able mystery In the case, which may bÂ«
j>artly cleared a. way by the developments
at the inquest.
Hurley or Curley was arrested at 4:30
o'clock on the morning of July 13 by Po-
Jiceniiin 1'. Uutler on Second street. He
was apparently Intoxicated, and at the
City Itison was booked under the name
of John Doe as a drunk.
Shortly after Ills arrest he was sent to
the Receiving Hospital lor treatment as
he seemed to have fclh-n into a sort of
coma. Dr. Uacigalupi attended the man
for acute alcoholism and returned him to
fcis cell. ]"Â»ur hours afterward he was
pent back to the hospital lor further
treatment. He was kept there for obser
vation till 11:30 a. m. en the next day
Mhen. as he grew no better, he was sent
to the City and County Hospital. Here a
â¢liagnosis revealed a fracture of the skull,
from which the unfort unite man died at
i:15 yesterday morning. The Coroner's
office was notified and the body removed
to the Morgue.
The case of Hurley or Curley evidently
Ftruek Coroner Cole as being remarkable
when the number <>f similar ones occur
ring lately an> taken into consideration.
"There are too many ea^es of fractured
fkulls reported nl this office of late," said
Coroner Cole, "l intend to look into this
case very particularly, as 1 consider it
rather pirar.ge that men who have been
picked uji by the police on the streets are
Â«fterwnrd discovered to have fractured
i-kulls without any explanation being of
fered as to how they came by them."

While the firemen of Engine 31 wero
fighting: the blp Pacific-street fire yester
day morning their own engine house at
1214 Pacific street was burning. When
they returned to rest after a hard strug
gle against the blazing element of de
struction they found their rooms fille.I
with smoke, and file blackened floor of
the building occupied by them charre 1
and iirpnphort Â»
In lighting the fire in the engine house,
which broke out about 2:20 o'clock,
two men were painfully burned. W.
ColHgan, n saloon-keeper a few doors
distant from the scene of the conflagra
tion, was hurned about the arms and
Charles McCarty had his left leg
scorched.
Enpine 31 was rushed to tho fin? which
destroyed the Standard Biscuit Factory
when the second alarm was sounded. All
the firemen connected with the company
left the house and closed the door*.
Later. on CcllipaTi saw dense clouds of
smoke, issuing from the windows of lho
house, and rushed to the place. He was
Joined by McCarty, and the two went into
the building. They found the fire in th*
basement, where the heaters used In
supplying hot water for the engine boiler
are located. Without hesitation both set
about to put out the blaze, and were
burned in the attempt. Their injuries
were treated at a neighboring store.
An alarm was turned in from box 123,
at the corner of Pacific and I^eavenworth
strpets. and Chief Sullivan Immediately
sent engines from the big (ire, which was
then under control, to assist In extin
guishing the flames. The lire is supposed
to have started about the heaters, and
considerable damage was done to the
lower portion of the building 1 .
