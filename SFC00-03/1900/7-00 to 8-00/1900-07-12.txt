a man of dignity, of standing and of
bright prospects. There were men
there who remembered him as one of
good fellowship, of brilliant attainments,
and there were men there who remem
bered him when he was expelled from
his club for having introduced a black
leg gambler into its rooms. There were
men there who probably thought of
the progress which he had made toward
an end which most men consider worse
than suicide. Some thought of John M.
Chretien as the domestic thief, the pur
loiner of his wife's diamonds, and other
thought of him as the unscrupulous,
unfeeling robber of an old woman.
Many temembered the cheap, petty
thief of a public fund, and others of thfc
reckless schemer who sought to use the
Police Department as a vehicle for bri
bery. All who knew him thought of him
as what he might have been and looked
at him as he was. despicable and at the
same time pitiable. He had reached the
end of his rope.
When Tlie Call published its expose
of the atrocious crime which had been
committed in Judge Troutt's Probate
Court, this paper did so with no other
motive than to assist in the punish
ment of rascals and to warn theXourt
that It has control of interests so deep
ly important to the community that
carelessness is akin to criminality. When
The Call asserted that the estate of a
dead man had been stolen by a bogus
heir from Judge Troutt's court, it spoke
the truth, which John M. Chretien con
fessed yesterday on the witness stand.
The Call asserted that the man to whdm
Judge Troutt had awarded the estate of
Joseph Sullivant was an impostor, a
drunken loafer, a roustabout of tender
loin saloons, named Charles Latner.
who was produced by Fred Hansted,
notoriously known as the blackleg,
"Your.g Dutchy."
John M. Chretien confessed yesterday
that th:s was the truth. He declared that
he 2?ked for no mercy and expected to
suffer for his crimes. He and Hansted
and the man who impersonated the dead
heir, he said, were the only guilty ones.
"Young Dutchy" had produced the heir
and Chretien had said he had done the
rest. He had supplied the impostor
with every fact in his representations
Latnrr was induced to make a deposi
tion which was carefully prepared by the
schemer. The bogus heir was persuaded
to sign the document and insist upon '{he
payment of what he claitned to be his
property. The inevitable development
of such affairs came, however, much
quicker than Chretien expected. The
bogus heir was improvident, extrava
gant and reckless. Knowing that he
had the unscrupulous attorney in his
j)o\ver. ''Young Dutchy" began to levy
blackmail. He was insistent in his de
mands for money, even resorting to
blows to enforce them. He forced the
scoundrel lawyer to secure loans, to ne
gotiate forged checks, to make fictitious
transfers and secure money from what
ever source he could. The men had
frequent quarrels and Chretien was be
ing gradually led toward a precipice
where exposure could not be possibly
avoided.
Jake Rauer was induced to advance
loans; Notary Lee D. Craig was per
suaded to issue fraudulent acknowledg
ments and Chretien's unsuspecting ne
gro servant was deluded into forging
signatures. It was imperative that
money should be raised at any hazard
and Chretien began to reap the evil
fruits of his crime long before exposure
came. In desperation he paid the bogus
heir money to leave the city, but the
impostor returned only to renew his
blackmail and to insist upon a satisfac
tion ol his demand. Hansted was per
suaded to go to Cape Nome, where he
now is, and the bogus heir was sent out
ol the State. Chretien was paying a ter
rible penalty for his offense against the
intestate dead.
Then came the final crash, and last
n:nht John M. Chretien and his negro
servant, Robert Colthorp, slept in the
County Jail. After Chretien had made
his confession, as it has been outlined,
ihc attorneys appointed by the Court
plied him with incessant questions.
They wanted to leave nothing undone
or unsaid which would shed light on the
scandalous affair. As one of them said,
the issue involved and the conclusions
sensation of the day was Â¦when James
Taylor Rogers shortened up the wick in
his lamp of information and threw but
feeble light in the path of the investiga
tion. He was roasted for his attitude by
McEnerney, but Barclay Henley, who
acted as his attorney, came to his rescue
more than once, and turned what poignant
remarks MeEJnerne'y drove at the witness
into crossfire between attorneys.
Lee D. Craij*. the notary, was called to
tell how it was he acknowledged half a
dozen signature* without seeing the signer
sign and without Knowing Â¦who he was.
but the notary had no explanation. He
was asked if hr had seen Sullivan and
asked him if he had signed, and Craig
said "Yes" altnoush Chretien had Just
said that "Sullivan" never went to Cralg'Â»
effice. He said. too. that Keane hal come
to him with Chretien to ask him to slpn
a receipt as a witness as well as to
acknowledge it immediately after Kear.e
said he had not been there in connection
with the Sullivan matter.
Ruef Explains.
Abe Ruef was another witr.es?. He hart
been" persistently guarding the interests
of his client. ex-Public Administrator
John A. Orinkbouse, from the opening of
the proceedings, and his first chance for
an explanation he eagerly selzrd upon.
He made a complete statement, of all that
happened in court, how he had waited for
Chretien and Rogers to settle their ques
tions of heirship between them, and how
he had never known the details of the
Rogers heirs, because Rogers would not
tell him, nor of John Sullivan, because
Chretien had him !n his own hands. His
statement cleared Drinkhouse artd him
self of any blame. In ' the .matter, and a
statement to that effect was made by the
investigating counsel.
Patrick Ryan of the Hibernia Bank was
also called to show- just Â¦what the bank's
books really did show about the parent
age of the deceased Joseph Sullivan, but
he did not testify without a preliminary
explanation from Joseph Tobin. attorney
for the bank, who explained that the
bank's books were not usually brought
Into court, but that an exception would
be made in the matter pending.
That closed the day, and then Judpe
Troutt. in a few words, commented on the
case and expressed his sorrow that he had
ever appointed Chretien as an attorney for
absent heirs.
"It Is a mistake I shall regret all my
life," he said, and his voice choked. His
own position in the matter, he said, he
would ndt comment upon, nor would he
even allow the attorneys" who had con
ducted the Investigation to declare that
he had been shown to be absolutely
blameless.
"The court is subject to criticism," he
said, "and will not reply to it."
Then he dismissed the petition to dis
tribute the estate to John Sullivan. whJch
reopens the case, and appointed Cormae.
Donohoe & Baum. attorneys for the Brit
ish Consul, to look after Rogers" heirs.
Chretien's testimony was as follows:
Chretien's Confession.
Yesterday I called upon Captain Seymour
and Informed him that I was desirous of
making a statement and he declined to ac
cept it. I told him that I was prepared to
be here or anywhere that he might suggest
at -any hour, day or night. He asked me to
be here this morning at 9 o'clock at his office.
I was .there at 8:30 o'clock this morning. I
want to state that I come here freely and
voluntarily and whatever statement I make Is
of my own motion and of my own accord. I
have not been promised anything. I have not
seen any of the counsel connected with this
case in any way. shape or form, nor talked
with the Judge nor anybody representing him.
nor any. of the attorneys or newspaper men
or anybody connected with this case In any
way. shape or form. A-nd with that I wish to
make the following statement:
My connection with, this estate began the
day before I was appointed by Judge Troutt
to represent the absent heirs. Mr. Ruef In
formed me Jhat on the following morning he
was going to file a petition In the estate of
Joseph Sullivan and that he thought it would
be a gocd thing If I was appointed to repre
sent the absent heir*, as he would like to
ree me make a fee out of the case, as It
was a case where an attorney for absent heirs
Fhould be appointed. That is the only con
versation I had â¢ with Mr. R>ie.*. The next
morning I cam" out with a blank application.
I called upon his Honor, Judge Troutt, In his
chambers a llttlÂ» before 10 o'clock and I asked
him to appoint me In the case. He took the
application and looked at It and he said. "TTiJs
Is out of order." I said. "What do you mean."
He said, "I have a way of doing this. I
have first of all to Investigate and examine
into the estate and see If It Is necessary that
an nttorney should be appointed. After I
have discovered that an attorney Is to be ap
peJnted in the case I want to see that the
appointment Is agreeable to the pecple rep
resenting the estate. â¢ It you will leave th!Â»
appointment with me. I will see the attorneyâ
who Is the attorney, by the way?" I said.
â¢â¢The attorney for the Public Administrator.
Mr. Ruef." He said. "I will see Mr. Ruef or
his representative, examine into it and if it
ts proper and I think it tÂ» right that you
should be appointed the appointment will be
given to Mr. McElroy. my clerk, and you will
be notified."
I picked up my hat and Just as I started for
the door Mr. Keane came in through the other
door. Mr. Keane is Mr. Ruef*s clerk. Judge
Troutt. said: "Mr. Keane. Mr. Chretien has
Just applied here to be appointed attorney for
the. absent heirs In -the Sullivan estate. Do
yon know anything about It?" Mr. Keane said:
"Well, be would be agreeable to us. In fact,
we would take it very kindly if he was ap
pointed.* Judge" Troutt then said: "Well. U
there- is no objection, under the circumstance*,
and you have thoroughly examined the papers
of the : estate and you know that an attorney
Is to be appointed?"
He said: "Tea, because there la an absent
Chretien's Appointment.
heir, and It fs absolutely necessary.** There
upon Judge Troutt signed the application and
I fllerl it. That is absolutely the only con
nection Judge Trcutt had with the case in
any way. Â»hape or form, until about the !4th
of Aug-jst. v.hen I called uprn him ag:iin
in his chan?.b?rs and asked him. giving him
that statement. If he would allow me a pre
liminary fee In the Sullivan estate. He looked
at thÂ» statement and he vaJJ: 'The only way
you can do this is to make an affidavit set
ting forth all the farts, a copy cf which will
have tn be s?rve>l upon the attorney repre
senting the Public Administrator, and It will
have to be heart! In open court." He said: "I
den't want to make any orders for counsel fees
In my chambers." I saM: "I don't think Mr.
Ruef would have any objections to this."
â¢â¢Well." he said. "I don"t care 'whether he
has or not, it a role I have established and
that I keep In force, and It is easy for you
ti-> make an affidavit and Â»erve It on the other
side and give them notice and have them pres
ent In court. I will hear it in the mnrning."
With that I went off and prepared the affidavit
that was reail here, of August 20. and sÂ»rve:l
It upon Mr. Ru"f and aak^d him tf he would
be In court. He said he would.
Mr. Ruef appeared in court en the memirg
of August 23 here with me. I was put on the
stand arid questions were asked me by Jurt^e
Troutt cr.d Mr. Ruef. and the Judge asked me
how much I expected, what I thought would be
a reasonable fee. I saM 11^). He saM: "That
is entirely too much. Mr. Uuef, what do you
th!nk aixj'.n It? Mr. Ruef thought it over for
unit- a little while and finally said: "Well.
I tMnk I1C0 would be about right; It would be
acceptable to us." Judge Troutt said: "I
think $100 is not too much under the circum
stance*." With that he made an ordfrr allow
ing me fir*. That em2Â»4 Judce Troutfa con
nectfen with It as far as I am concerned in this
estate In any way, shape or fcrm. And I want
tr> eay now that the grossest kind of Injustice
has been done by the newspapers to Judg<9
Troutt in this matter.
How the Combination Progressed.
The next Derson Interested is Mr. Ruef. Mr.
Ruefs only connection with it was making that
suggestion that I be appointed attorney for
absent heirs. Barring that. Mr. Ruef has had
nothing whatever to do In this matter with
me. exceptinz that he has be*n very strict
In every possible way that he could In the
estate. And as far as I am concerned. I know
positively that he did not know of this al
leged Mr. Sullivan, or anybody else connecte.l
with the estate excepting what I representet
to h!m. Mr. Drlnkhouse Is absolutely cut of
It. I never had anything to do with Mr.
Drlnkhouse In any way. shape or form, except
ing as the Public Administrator, when I went to
him and presented my order for the $100 and
one or two other conversations I had with
him. That Is t!*e only thing I had to do with
Mr. Drinkhouse. The only connection I hz<t
with Mr. Roa-ers was when he served the
notice uson me. I asked ' him when he would
have proofs. That was. 1 think. eaTly In Oc
tober. He said that he would have "them in
October, or whenever the time waa I have
forgotten when the time was. but he said
within two or three months. When this matter
came ud I went to see him and he told me he
ha.l not been able to make connection* yet
he had not been able to get all the proofs that
he wanted and would 1 give him more time
and so then we all agreed to let the matter
stand over until the end of AnrtU
At that time I went to Mr. Ro C erÂ» and de
manded his proof, and he said whatever state
ments he had to make he would file a paner in
court, which I believe he did: it was n<-ver
served on me that I know of. but he filed it la
court oa the day of the hearing. I asked Mr
Rogers why he had changed Ms mind In refer
ence to It; In fact. It was asked him here In
open court in my presence, and he said that
Mr. Rauer bad convinced him by examlnln
the records of the Hibemta Bank that the
facts set forth b7 the alleged Mr. Sullivan were
correct. I or Mr. Hansted. or any one that I
know of. never gave Mr. Rogers one dollar that
I know of.
Mr. Rauer'* only connection with the casÂ«*
was that of a money broker, that Is. advancing
money In the estate. He took no. part to any
transaction otherwise. Judge Goucher was at
my office twiceâ I said once yesterday, but I
recollected afterward that he had been there a.
second time. The first time he was Introduced
to me; the second time he came up after the
final account had been filed he brought me
a copy of It. That was the only time that I
have seen Judg-e Goucher.
Mr. McEneraeyâ He brought yon a copy oC
the final account?
He brought me a *ynops!Â» of the account that
had been filed by the Public Administrator, and
Mr. Hansted had come out here. It appears,
with him In the morning, and then he brought
the memorandum on half a. sheet of yellow
rÂ«rÂ«r.
I don't know of anybody else to speak of now
In connection with the case. I think these ara
all the people that were connected with the
case. I want to exonerate all of those people
that I have mentioned as far as I am concern
ed personally, and to say that I know that
nothing was done In It that they had any con
nection with.
Chretien Takes the Blame.
Whatever wrongj has been done has been
done by myself and Mr. Hans ted. I want to
exonerate the colored man who testified yes
terday, and I want to Â«ay furthermore that hts

to end. and whatever harm and wrong has been
done has been mine, and I am the only man
to sufTcr: I am the. only man that ought to be

Kot to say, gentlemen, and I am ready to an

THE expose made by The Call of a
shocking crime committed by pro
bate sharks upon the unprotectcl
dead in this city ended yesterday in a
in Judge Troutt's court One
of the scoundrels whose pernicious oper
ations have been a menace to the living
and the dead in San Francisco talked
Jiis way within the gates of San Quentin.
while he submitted himself to the cruel
degradation of making a public confes
sion in the presence of hundreds of men.
This man, seemingly unconscious of his
terrible humiliation, brazen in his de
fiance of eventhing that his self-respect
could command, was John M. Chretien
and last night he slept in the County
Jail. The outrageous affair had reached
its climax.
The proofs submitted by The Call and
the facts discovered at the investigation
had broken down the most audacious
conspirator of them all and he confess
ed his guilt. He admitted that in var
ious ways he is a scoundrel, a rascal, a
forger, n perjurer and a thief of danger
ous accomplishments. When he took
the witness stand and from mouth tn
mouth went whispered words that lie
was about to admit his guilt, he was the
o-ol-it. ca'm^st, most unconcerned man
in the courtroom. His agitation of the
day before had passed away. His shift
less, restless, unhappy efforts at subter
fuge and evasion had disappeared. lib
pleading for mercy by indirection was
gone. There was net, as there had been
the nervous twitching of the lips, the
mumbled words that could hardly find
expression; twisting of the hands and
convulsive movements of the body
Â¦which had characterized his demeanor
of the dry before. He had passed that
stage in his experience where there was
left still some sign of hope.
He was governed by the desperate
calmness of despair and was resigned
to accept the humiliation of public con
tempt, which, as he progressed in his
recital of guilt, was not unmixed with
pity. There has seldom been in a court
of San Francisco a more dramatic spec
tacle as was there presented, when this
rnan. facing hundreds of people, whom
he had known for years upon a plane of
good fellowship and social equality, ut
tered the words which condemns him as
the most miserable of thieves â a robber
of the dead.
Absolutely self-possessed, calm to the
verv point of absolute unconcern, he ad
mitted that he had organized the con
spiracy to rob the estate of Joseph Sul
livan, to impose upon the Probate Court
and to commit a shocking crime upon
the community. He confessed that in
conjunction with a blackguard of the
tenderloin and a drunkard, whose inter
vals of sobriety were remote, he had
conspired to produce a bogus heir: haÂ«l
induced men to commit forgery, had be
come a perjurer, had fabricated false
documents, had presented fictitious
claims, had negotiated fraudulent
checks, had schemed for and won from
one of the shrewdest money brokers
money equal to the value of the estate
and had ended by finding himself in the
torment of being blackmailed and
hounded from place to place by the men
who had been his fellow conspirators.
He gave every "shocking detail of the
plot by which he robbed the estate of
the dead man. With insulting calmness
he told how he had lied on the witness
stand the day before; how he had de
ceived ether attorneys and the Judge of
the court; how he had rhade an ignorant
servant his unsuspecting and unknown
accomplice in his criminal scheme. The
courtroom was crowded to its very
doors by hundreds of men, but there
was absolute silence except for the de
liberate, well-chosen, unblushing, con
fessing words of scoundrelism which
were uttered by the man in the witness
chair. It seemed almost incredible that
a man could have sunk so' low as to
submit to the terrible self-abasement hi
John M. Chretien. He seemed to pos
sess a very lust for dishonor. He was
eager to picture himself far blacker
than any of his accusers would have
done. He presented, perhaps, the most
remarkable instance of a dead con
science that ever was given in the local
/ courts of justice. He had gone the pace.
There were men in that courtroom
who knew him when he was an hon
orable m ember of the legal profession;

CHRETIEN CONFESSES HIS CRIME

SAN FRANCISCO, THURSDAY, JULY 12, 1900.
VOLUME LXXXVIII-NO. 42.
to be leached were of interest not alone
to the people of the city, but to the en
tire State. The very foundation of jus
tice in California had, been attacked and
undermined and the attorneys insisted
upon striving to learn every particular
of the conspiracy. As this searching in
quiry progressed a series of startling
facts was developed. It was discovered
that Lee D. Craig, one of the most
prominent notaries public in this city,
has been grossly negligent in the man
agement and policy of his notarial busi
ness. It was shown that he had affixed
his signature to documents signed by
men whom he had never seen. He had
left the door open for a palpable fraud
and the conspirators had jumped
through it.
When Chretien had finished his con
fession, which was listened to in silent
interest by hundreds of astounded men,
the Court ordered him into the custody
of the.. Sheriff to await future proceed
ings: The colored man, Robert Col
thorp, was also arrested, and with
Chretien,. was taken last night to the
County Jail.
A remarkable condition of affairs has
resulted from this sensational', case.
Chretien is in the County Jail, but there
is no charge against him. He cannot
be detained without accusation very
long and the police and District Attor
ney Byington are at sixes and sevens as
to what to do. The police insist that it
is the duty of the District Attorney to
call a meeting of the Grand Jury at once
and indict the imprisoned lawyer. Dis
trict Attorney Byington replies that
such a course of action is not his duty.
but that a complaint should be made
against Chretien by some of the inter
ested parties and proceedings could be
begun at once. The police retort that
such a procedure would delay the mat
ter unwarrantably long in the Police
Courts. Here the matter stands, but it
is probable that some. decision will be
reached to-day.
During- the investigation yesterday,
James Taylor. Rogers was also examined
and gave his version of his connection
with the sensational, scandalousprobate"
crime. During his- examination the
books of the Hibernia Bank ! were ' pre-.
scnted in court. Joseph S. Tobitv the
acting Mayor, had custody: of. these rec
ords and declared that he wanted the
Court to understand distinctly that - he
had answered the summons to bring the
records into court" only throughTcour-
tesy and not to create a precedent for
further demand. His remarks were con
sidered to be particularly opportune. He
said that the bank has found it abso
lutely necessary to keep these records
awaj r from the eager .eyes of scrutiniz
ing, scheming, corrupt scavenger law
yers, who use their information to steal
estates. A significant buzz of comment
passed -through the room at these re
marks and the ordinary incidents of the
r.ftcrncon wen* resumed. It was not
long before the whole story of crime,
conspiiacy and theft had been told. The
investigation was closed. Every grave
allegation which The Call had . made
had been proved, and for the expose
which this paper had given Judge
Troutt expressed his thanks. - f
A ring of thieving lawyers had been
destroyed. A warning had been given
to those who might seek to emulate the
evil success of these. conspirators. The
reputable members of the bar had been
aroused to a sense that a, crime reflect
ing., deeply upon them , had been com
mitted and must' be exposed. The court
had been, convinced; that in matters as
sacred and as. serious as is the care and
protection" of the property of the 'dead,
the most absolute -vigilance must, be ob
served. And when; John M. Chretien
was taken from the courtroom in which
he had practiced as an honorable law
yer to the County- Jail, malefactors such
as he had. reason to fear that it. is dan
gerous to rob ' the property of the in
testate, dead. Â¦ , â¢
"W â¢ w, THATEVEB wrong has been

only man to 'suffer. I am the only
man that ought: t<S b8 blamed for this
"entire- thing. .That is all I have .to
say, gentlemen, and I am willing, to
answer any questions you have.-
That was the: confession made by John
M. Chretien", before. Judge Troutt yester
day.-. He. had exonerated everybody, even
to the unfortunate negro whose greatest
crime J was . the doing of his | and
then /when he came to himself and Han
sted lie took theblame. . .
Chretien's- story was not all told, for
back of it there is the suggestion of Han
sted's', demand for money and his 'threat
of if ; it was not paid; ; .- v. v

callihg s every day, demanding, money when'
there 1 was no -money, '(and threatening to
tell the whole? dfsfjraceful affair;, if . the
money were not'fourid somewhere. Chre-
tien could not get it from the estate, so
he/went to Rauer, and before Rauer
would pay it the miserable sinner had to
sin again and again, and forgery, per
jury, false representations and deceit of
every kind marked his headlong career
toward publicity and the penitentiary.
It' was the most dramatic scene that
has ever, been enacted in a local court.
"When the Judge called for order Chretien
stepped forward. It was announced that
he had a statement to make, and permis
sion to make it was granted, and then for
nearly all the morning the man testified
against himself, taking all the blame and
offering only this explanation, "I must
have been crazy."
A Dramatic Recital.
There was not a sound In the courtroom
during the recital. There -was not a man
to leave his place through those hours of
self-accusation; there was not a word lost
upon the throng that filled the courtroom,
stood along- the rails and overflowed Into
the lobby and from there Into the corri
dor. They sat and stood and staredâ
open-mouthed, open-eyed â and watched
the man who had started so well, talk
himself behind prison bars and Into a
convict's garb. .
There was no hesitation In Chretien's
manner. He had made up his mind and
the relief which a final decision brings
with it had restored the 'nerve so badly
shaken' by the searching questions of
Tuesday. HÂ«? told a plain, straightfor
ward tale, without attempt to shield him
self and without regard to its effect upon
his future. It was not a nice story. : It
was a story of as cold-blooded and "dev
ilish a swindle as ever robbed a grave,
and sympathy for' the self-accuser was
burled under the ever increasing convic
tion that he had forfeited all claims to
sympathy. He told how Sullivan was
found,- how he was coached, how his
fraud progressed and. how the negro Col
thorp signed his name whenever neces
sary. -
And then, when he had made his state
ment, the lawyers took him In hand and
plied question after question, searching
into every point and every, situation, and
sparing neither the witness nor his part
ners in crime. ;
The end of It all was an order that
Chretien-be placed 1 in tho custody of the
Sheriif. there to await ;the fate the fu
ture has ! for hlm. r His punishment has
not been, decided: upon, but It will hot be
long before Chretien approaches the bar
where for so .long: he honorably pleaded,
not as a lawyer, respected 'and esteemed,
but as a man upon whom the shadow of
the penitentiary has already fallen.

JUDGE TROUTT THANKS
PRESS AND ATTORNEYS
And you never heard anything about that
power of attorney? No.
And when you testified yesterday that that
had bef-n signed and Bowden had It. that was
not true, was it? Yes, It had been signed.
Did the man sign it down in San Jose? Ko,

And Rowden still -has that document? I pre
eume he has.
Who Figned that? Mr. Colthorp.
He v.-as to go In ,to a notary public and ac
knowledge that the signature of Colthorp was
his own. What was your Idea in using this
negro boy for all these signatures? Well,
really, I couldn't tell you; I think I was crazy,
that is all.
Well. >ou needed similarity of signature,
didn't you? No; I think I was crazy; 1 have
come to that conclusion.
Dutchy Tried Blackmail.
When did you first have a talk with Dutchy
and I>utchy's Sullivan to the effect that or
course Putchy'p Sullivan was not Sullivan at
all? Not until after I had ppoken to Mr. Ruet
and everybody else concerned and had been to
the bank and everywhere elfe. and he had got
quite a little money; then he wanted S.W more:
hÂ«Â« had to have (Â» And then he simply black
mailed me, that was about the size of it. He
pays. "I have got you. and you have got to go
through with this thine."
Who told' you that, he did? Yes, I was slm
{â¢ly blackmailed nut of it, that Is all.
When was it that he said he had to have
VM more? When he got It from Mr. Rauer:
I tried to get n from Mr. Ruef and li-s wcullu't
erive it to me
Did you gft your first money from Rauer be
fore or after the deposition was taken? Afte*
the deposition was taken.
The first monÂ«y that you got wflf $500. Is
that rieht. fcr an J^W assignment In the es
tate? Yes.
What tiÂ»canie of -{hat $300: how was It Â«li-
Dr Weatherly feels aggrieved that his
name should have been used by John M.
Chretien in a manner which may cast re
flection upon it. Dr. Weatherly says that
hi*Â» connection with the scandalous affair
was purely casual and perfectly Innocent.
He met Chretien on the street one day and
was asÂ»ked if he knew any one of promi
nence in London. He gave the names of
Messrs. Rennett and Walker and wishing
to assist Chretien wrote to them. Further
than this he had absolutely nothing to tio
with the odious affair.
Weatherly'9 Answer.
Mr Lloyd â As I. understand It the counsel are
relieved from any further duties In the mat
ter
The Courtâ The counsel, of course, under
stand my feeling!" In thla matter, and the bar
at large undoubtedly appreciates the services
so generously rendered here In the interest of
the profession and of the court.
Mr Ruef-I think It is due to your Honcr
that the counsel here should state that It is
evident, and the testimony has disclosed it.
that your Honor was absolutely Imposed upon
here, and that no blame can attach to you
at all fcr any of the proceedings here ta this
court taken by your Honor.
The Courtâ I do not desire any such state
ment and I do not want to impose any further
service upon coursel. The facts have been de
veloped, and if the court here is entitled to
criticism however harsh, the court will sub
mit to it at all times. I shall never imouan
the- motives of any newspaper when they criti
cize the actions of the JudsÂ» here or anYhody
else in this court. I am sattsfied that they will
endeavor to do Justice, and if they wrontr any
body they will do so Inadvertently. I will al
ways try 'to do my public duty as I see and
understand it and endeavor to Prevent fraud
being perpetrated upon the court. -The action
of the press in this matter Is something that I
think has been of great advantage to tha com
munity.
On the motion of Mr. Ruef the order
that the property be distributed to John
Sullivan was set aside, so that the matter
may remain open until the true heirs are
found, when a new order of distribution
will be made.
On the sufCReatlon of Mr. Lloyd the set
tlement of the account was also put over,
with the same object In view:
The Courtâ I vouM like to say *fter this
very serious and thorough tnve*ti*ation that
I am grateful to the distinguished Krf abla
attorney, who ha.ve assisted the court in pr,,
duclnK th* evidence bearing upon the ma " e ,T*
in controversy. This evidence has disclosed the
glarins fact that a Bro?s fraud has been per
petrated upon this court. While at all times
I am anxiously on my guard against any at
tempted wrong-doing and try to avoi.1 mis
takes. It ifms that in connection with this es
tate an attorney at law. an appointee or thts
court, has conspired with others in an effcr.
to obtain wrongful possession of the property Ot
this estate. Fortunately, however, thanks tr>
the <ially press and to Mr. Ruef. attorney for
the Public Administrator, whose care and cau
tion have been admirable and wise, the estate
is still in the hands of tha Public Administra
tor. In the custody of the law.
Mr Ruefâ It Is In the Union Trust Cnmpajy
Bank. If your Honor please, and has been tnera
since it was first received.
The Courtâ While I am always ready to n?.p
raise a fallen man and give him a helping nan 1
that I made a mistake In appointing:, a year
aro last May. this particular attorney at law.
John M. Chretien, to act in the interest o! tht
ceurt and tn that of Justice. It is an appoint
ment which I shall regrret more than wor<!Â» can
express for the rest of my life. Punishment,
wilt haWto be inflicted, not only as a pÂ»naity
for this wror-t-dointr, but also to deter others
frcm following such an example. This decr<"Â»
of distribution and the order settling the final
account having been set aside, I will at this
Hire Â»et down for hearing both the applica
tion for settlement of the final account anl
for distribution for Monday week.
Drinkhouse Exonerated.
Abe Ruef was the last witness cf
the day.
He made a full explanation of the
whole connection of the office of John
A. Drinkhouse, the then Public Ad
ministrator, with the estate of John
Sullivan, and his explanation was ac
cepted as full and complete. Mr. Ruef
then put in a word for Mr. Knox.
"Nobody suspects Mr. Knox," said
Mr. Lloyd.
Mr. Ruefâ Well, do you suspect
me? That is what I want to know.
Is there any suspicion about me in
your mind?
Mr. Lloydâ Why, of course I think
you have entirely cleared yourself in
this matter. "- I "
Mr. Ruefâ Then, of course, I don't
want to say any more.
The Court â Well, that is sufficient
then.
This ended the testimony and Judge
Troutt then said:
The question struck home, but Henley
came to the rescue of the witness. mÂ«
idea was lost in a maze of lawyers
wrangling and Rogers waa saved from
answering.
Do you think it is any less repre
hensible for a lawyer without pay
or fee or reward to permit an estate
to bs robbed in a court where he prac
tices than it would be for him to per
mit it to be robbed upon the payment
of a fee?

from any one in any connection witn me

OLD STREET-CAR BARNS '
ARE DESTROYED BY FIRE
The old car barns on Brs^an street,
near Seventh, were practically destroyed
early this morning by a fire, the origin of
which Is at present unknown. As soon as*
the blaze was discovered an alaim was
turned in from box 152. The Fire Depart
ment could do but little, however, beyond
protecting adjoining property from the-
Hames and the buildings are practically a
total loss.
The old car barns were large frame
structures, which for some time past had
been occupied by junkmen and scaven
gers. It iÂ» supposed that a cigar stump
cast among the inflammable contents waa
responsible for the destruction of the old
buildings.

Not waiving any right now, because I con
ceive that you have no right to ask this ques
tion outside of matters concerning' this inves
tlgation. I think that la the only matter which
has ever come to me from Mr. Beckett In any
shape, as I now recall it, and that came in a
peculiar way that I do not care to go into. It
was honorable on his part, and nothing wrong
In It. â¢
. McEnerney then turned to the trip to
the Hibernia Bank that Rogers said he
made with Rauer, but he got but Uttle
satisfaction from It. Rogrers said he went
there and came back attain: that he saw
a clerk named Ryan, but when Ryan was
asked to stand up In the courtroom Rog

Mr. McEnerney-Well. I think it is. I Just

Mr. McKnerney-Well. it rnl*ht be some of

Mr McEnerneyâ Well. I know, but with your
kind aid and advice. I will go through with it.
the summer, not being over.
Mr Henleyâ There Is a little too much of a
lÂ»ctu're in this thing, it seems to me. and this
harancue by my learned friend Is something
that this witness ourIU not to be subjected tiÂ».
Thi<Â« witness If he wants to. ran walk out of
thi-Â« court now. and the reason why he Is on
the' stand Is to assist in the exposure of any
W The 8 'couÂ«-And that Is why I believe that
Ml*. Rogers will now answer the question. The
court desires to know what the course of busi
ness connected with these things is.
Mr Henleyâ Any testimony that this wit
ness 'gives In this investigation is purely volun
tary There is no compulsory process that can
reach any witness in thismatter. Mr. Rogers
Is here to tell everything that He knows, but he
Is not here to be subjected to disrespectful allu
sion or any manner of disrespect, and I claim
the protection of the court for him.
Mr Ruefâ I desire to have that question an
swered. Mr. Beckett is one of my employes.
The Court â Mr. Rogers will be exonerated
from any criticism on the part of Mr. Beckett
or anybody else in connection with an attempt
to throw light on the proceedings In this de
partment or any other department. I desire to
get all the light I can of Mr. Rogers concern
ing these matters, and if there is anybody
offering any such Inducements to anybody I
would like to know it. in the Interest of public
Justice.
Mr. Rogersâ Well, if your Honor please, my
own private business outside of this case I do
not propose to ko Into.
Mr. McEnerneyâ Do you decline to answer,
Mr. Rogers?
Mr. Roger?â I decline to answer. My busi
ness outside of this case is not concerned here
In any way, shape or form. What concerns
this case I am ready to tell, but I do not pro
pese to open my office to any Inquiry as to
everything that may have been done in the last
twenty years.
Mr. McEnerneyâ I think that the time Is ripe
and the inquiry pertinent to know whether the
attorneys who practice In this department and
in department nine and represent foreign heirs
find their employment through the speed and
diligence of their typewriters, aided a ad abetted
by employe* in the office of a^public official
upon an agreement, express or implied, for a
division of the compensation.
Mr. Ruefâ Representing the public official re
ferred to, wÂ» invite the inquiry; we ask that
the witness an?wer the question. We state
that no such agreement was ever made, and
cannot be proven to have been made, with our
knowledge. We hope that Mm Rogers will see
his way clear to enlightening 'the court upon
this proposition. We have absolutely no
knowledge of any such agreement.
The Courtâ What say you. Mr. Rogers?' Are
you willing to give the court assistance, con
sidering what the matter now under investi
gation Is?
Mr. Rogersâ I am perfectly willing to assist
justice, but I deny the right of this court to
go probing Into my private business. I know
my rights perfectly. I will answer any ques
tion that concerns this matter.
Being further appealed to by Mr. Ruef,
Mr. Rogers finally answered : .
I said I didn't know whether they would do
It. He said that was all right, and he called
up some clerk and thÂ» clerk went downstairs
and I handed the order of appointment to the
clerk and he went off somewhere. He was
gone quite a lon>? while. He said there was a
lot cf Joseph Suilivans. but finally Identified
It and fcaid thit the money had been paid to
Mr. Ruef or to Mr. Drinkhouse. at least. 8oÂ»e
time' prior to that.
You did not have any Information about the
maiden name of Sullivan's mother at that
time, did you? No. sir: I did not.
And you did not give any such information
to the Hlbcrnia, Bank? No, they, gave it to
me.
When dM you get that Information? Prior
to the taking of the deposition.
Did you give that information to Dutchy?
Yes, sir, and he gave it to Sullivan.
You gave it to him so that Sullivan might
know the maiden name of his mother? I did.
So he would be able to testify to it on the
taking of his depcsitlon? YeÂ». sir.
Will you describe this man. Uutchy'9 Sul
livan? He \vaÂ» a tbin man. with very nar
row features, with a rather heavy light mus
tache, rather thick brown hair. I should think.
it was not black, and rather delicate hands:
dressed in black; 1 always saw him dressed
in black.
Where did you meet him bfiides at your
office and besides at Ruef's office? In front
of the cigar store of Rome Harris.
Did you. before taking his deposition, ask
him what country he was born in and ko
over in a general way what he would be able
to testify to on the taking of the deposition?
No. sir, I don't think I did. because Dutchy
said to me. "You ask him any question -you
want to."
He was well crammed. You understood that
he was well prepared for It? Well. I don't
know; Dutchy said, "Just go ahead and ask
him anvthinu," and I did.
Where? At Mr. Kuefs office. thÂ« first time
I talked to him. I never spoke to him before
on this proposition.
What was the reason for sending up for
this man to Sacramento? What did you want
him down here for? Why was that deposition
taken? That deposition was taken at the re
qufst of Mr. Ruef, who said that he would
not advise Mr. Drinkhouse to pay out a dol
lar or let any money be paid or counsel any
thing to be paid until he was satisfied that he
W-H.S the man and he wanted hia deposition
Was anything said In that conversation that
he would not file a petition for distribution
until the man's dt position was taken and hla
Identity established by his oath? I don't think
so. I don't think he .'aid that.
Had Mr. Rauer ever seen the man until the
deposition was taken? His father saw him
when we first took him over there. I think
that was the first time I saw him.
Rogers on the Stand.
The afternoon opened with a call for
James Taylor Rogers. He had been
â¢ called just before the noon recess, but
Barclay Henley announced that he was
for the 'present Rogers' attorney, and n?
would not allow hla client to go on the
stand until he had had a consultation with
him. So when in the afternoon Ropers was
called agaJn. the consultation had. been
had and there was no objection. The wit
ness pulled up a table, spread tt deep with
his papers and started in to complete nis
testimony in regard to his correspondence
In search of Sullivan's hHrs. '
He said the information that there
might be a Sullivan heir in Soho square,
London, he received from Sam Beckett.
He was then questioned closely as to why
he did not notify the court of what he
had heard from Ann Sullivanâ that the
onlv Sullivan in Soho square was deadâ
and all the answer Ropers would give
was that he had told the court in his pe
tition to have the estate distributed to
them. Then it turned out that all there
was to that effect in the petition was the
conventional allegation that the Chretien
heirs were "false and without right, and
a minute after it developed further that
this petition was never filed in court, al
though copies of it had been served on
both Ruef and Chretien.
A line of inquiry into why it was that
he suddenly dropped hia case for the heirs
was tlwn pursued, and for half an hour
Rof-ers was busy explaining that thej .had
not answered his letters, and therefore
he was not bound to help them: ajid rur
ther, that he had asked for a co Jtinuanoe
and if it were granted he could proceed
to die his heirs up again, and if it were
not granted it would be reversible error
in his opinion. Also that Rauer s potent
arguments at the Hibernia. Bank and the
information he had secured there made
him f-el that his heirs were not the right

Your testimony yesterday that anybody had

And about his father and mother and eo

And that You communicated to this man who
represented himself as Sullivan. and to
Duuhy? Yes, sir. V
And the balance of It was made up by Mr.
Dutchy or the man? I don't know who made it

we wanted him.
Hut before you knew of the existence of the

â¢would have Suillvan here any time I wanted

T>utchy, and they talked for a' minute, salil
just a wcrd or two. .and Dutchy Â«ald, "Well, I
will go nlong. too." So we walked down
MoniKcmery street, and when we Kot to the

HARD QUESTIONS FOR LAWYER ROGERS
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JULY 12, 1900
/WOULD like to say after this very serious and thorough investigation that I, am grateful to the
distinguished and able attorneys who have assisted the Court in producing the evidence bearing
v â¢ upon the matters in controversy. This evidence has disclosed the glaring fact that a gross fraud
has been perpetrated upon this Court. While at all times I am anxiously on my guard against any
attempted wrongdoing and try to avoid mistakes, it seems that in connection with this estate an at
torney at law, an appointee of this Court, has conspired with others in an effort to obtain wrongful
possession of the property of this estate. Fortunately, however s thanks to the daily press and to Mr.
Ruef, attorney for the Public Administrator, whose care and caution have been admirable and
wise, the estate is still in the hands of the Public Administrator, in the custody. of the law.
While I am always ready to help raise a fallen man and give him a helping hai\d where no
harm comes to others thereby, I find that I made a mistake in appointing, a year ago last May, the
particular attorney at law, John Mi Chretien, to act in the interest of the Court and in that of justice.
It is anappointment which 1 shall regret more than words can express for the rest of my life. Pun-,
ishment will have to be inflicted, not only as a penalty for this zvrongdoing, but also to deter others
from following such an example. This decree of distribution and the order settling the final ac
count having been set, aside, I will at this time set down for hearing both the application for settle
ment of the final account and for distribution for Monday week.
. .- J do not want to impose any further service upon counsel. \ The facts have been developed,
and if the Court here is entitled to criticism, however harsh, the Court will submit to it at all times. I
shall never impugn the motives \of any newspaper when Jhcy criticize the actions of the Judge here
or anybody else in this court. I am satisfied, that they zvill endeavor to do justice, and if they wrong
anybodyjhcywilldoso inadvertently.. I will always try to do my duty, iny public duty, as' I see
and understand < it , and Â¦ endeavor to prevent fraud being perpetrated, upon the Court. The action
of the press in this matter is something that I think has been of great advantage to the community.
â Judge 'Trout fs [words as he closed the investigation. ., '.', Â¦': . . ; Â¦ ". :
' Â¦Â¦ 'Â¦ 'Â¦->Â¦'Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦. v ' : -' _" \ -' Â¦ ' v Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ â¢.-Â¦'. â¢': : Â¦ Â¦ ' - Â¦
that is all.
That was before the decree of distribution
took place that you had this talk with Dutchy?
Yes, sir.
Was Dutchy's Sullivan with him? No, sir.
Dutcby was alone. Mr. Sullivan, or this man,
-was never present when any money was paid
over by me to him; he always had him away.
Dutchy told you at that conversation, in\
Â¦which he said he had been offered a thousand
dollars to tell this story, to be paid by Mr.
Lawrenceâ you mean Mr. I^awrence. of thÂ«
Examiner. dr> you not? I presume so; he just
Now tell ijs what took place between you
and Dutchy. Well, he produced a 1-tter from
his landlady that he had to pay a board hill
and he had to do this, and he had to do that?,
and Mr. Sullivan had to have some money, he
didn't have any shoes, and he had to have this
money. I think that that waa subsequent to
the taking of this disposition. Well, he said
he had to have the money: that was all.
What pIsp did you say to him? How did he
blackmail you? Well. I told him why not wait
till May 4. till the thing came, up, and ftk said
he had got tired of waiting; he said he had
sent Senator Ouucher out here, and there
wasn't anything done In the estate; that it
was nil darned nonsense, that Rogers and Ruef
and I were taking the estate. I said that
was not true; that he could go and see Mr.
Ruef. that he could go and pee Mr. Rogers,
or he could bo and see anybody.
He told you something: that made you feel
you were being blackmailed, and had to go
through with it. What did he say? He said:
"You know, you have got those powers of at
torney, and this man Sullivan is the man that
is going to raise the dickens about.lt, having a
man impersonating him." " And then I saw the
box that 1 was in. #
The Power of Attorney. ;
It was before that time that you had the
talk with him about being in th<* fix of hav
ing somebody else sign the power of attorney?
and signed, if I am not mistaken, at the
same time that the check was indorsed and
at the same time the two receipts were in
dorsed.
Who drew this order? I think it was drawn
by Mr, Ruef.
They refused to give you any money until
Mr. Rauer furnished all these papers? * Mr.
Hansted was upJn Mr. Ruef's office that ajter
noon with .Mr.sHaucr and myself and they
hacked and filled over the amount of money
that was to be given and that was when the
thing was settled.
Did you know that that three hundred dollars
was to j?o to Hansted himself? Did he tell you
how much he was paying this man who was
impersonating Sullivan? No, sir.
Did you discover It? He simply said that
he' had to divide with him. Whether he did
or not I don't know.
Sullivan Was Coached.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLING
TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, July 11.â
Chief Wilkie of the secret service at
tached very little importance to the re
port printed in a New York paper this
morning of an alleged plot to assassinate
President McKinley. â¢ He thought it prob
able that the information which origin
ally reached Messrs. Odell and Dick came
from a crank or romancer and he was cer
tain that If either of those gentlemen had
believed that there was any real founda
tion for the report they would have com
municated with him at once.
It Is not unusual for the secret service
office to receive communications purport
ing to expose plots tÂ» kill the President
or other public men. Many of these come
from cranks, but If there seems to be
any real foundation lor them they are
investigated. The latest communication
of the kind received by Mr. Wilkie was
dated "Cleveland. June 17." It purported
to tell of a gigantic conspiracy of anar
chists from Cleveland. Chicago and other
places to come to Washington, blow up
all of the public buildings and kill the
President and other prominent men. Mr.
Wilkie thinks it is possible that the same
crank has put himself into communication
with Mr. Dick or Mr. Odell.
President McKinley is being guarded
while In Canton by agents of the secret
service. In fact, whenever the President
leaves Washington there is never a mo
ment when one or more of the secret ser
vice men are not near him. These pre
cautions are not tak*>n nt the request of
the President, but over his protest. He
Is averse to being guarded, but his ad
visers realize that it is impossible to
foresee what some crank might attempt
to do and some of Chief Wilkle's most re
liable men are always on the lookout for
any suspicious action by any one In the
presence of the President.
NEWBITRG. N. Y.. July 11.â Chairman
E. B. Odell of the Republican State Com
mittee said to-day concerning the alleged
plot to assassinate President McKinley:
"I read the account in a newspaper this
morning with reference to an alleged plot
to assassinate President McKinley and al
so as to the part I am supposed to have
taken in the matter. I have nothing to
say upon the subject except that I started
an investigation on the line of what I sup
pose to be political information, and I dis
covered either a crank or a Baron Mun
chausen. and en the principle that an
ounce of prevention is worth a pound of
cure, it is probable that my report to
Secretary Dick is the cause for the extra
care now being taken of the President. I
have nothing further td say on this sub
ject except that I regret that some one
has been indiscreet enough to make up of
a trifling matter the gigantic plot dis
closed in the newspapers."
CLEVELAND. Ohio. July 11.â Senator
Hanna to-day denied the report that a
plot to assassinate President McKinley
had been discovered in New York.
"This." said Mr. Hanna. pointing to the
story of the alleged plot published in the
morning papers, "is the first I have heard
of it. There is absolutely, to the best of
my knowledge, no truth in It."

least two of these were employed in the
steward's department.
Of the other two one wore a wedding
ring bearing the inscription "B. Peitsch.

marked "R. W.. 1S90."
After the ninth body had been brought
up the men at work in the hold in
search for bodies announced that they
had counted fifteen piled in a heap In
the steward's room. The door of this
room was found locked. The fire did
not set near thf unfortunate fifteen and
their lives might have been saved but
for the breaking of the prlass in the win

the room filled with water and they were
drowned like rats In a trap. These bod

than those previously found.
At 7 o'clock the searchers quit work
because they could not see in the hold.
There were eight more bodies, accord

NEW YORK. July 11.â Twenty-four bod
ies were recovered from the hold of the
burned steamship Saale to-day, which
makes the total number of dead taken
from this ship alone sixty. Most of the
bodies were so badly burned .or mutilated
that recognition was impossible, but sev
eral were identified by initials or names
on articles taken from parts of clothing
that sometimes remained. All of them
appeared to be of workmen in the holds
of the steamship. Great pumps were
worked in the Saale to-day and by Â»'3u
p. m. the vessel was floated. The sh'iD
was In nine or ten feet of mud, and when
she finally freed herself from this body
she seemed to jump fully two feet out of
the water.
Four of the bodies brought up werp
policy of the administration, disapproving
of trusts, commending the insular power
of the Government, approving the gole.
standard and pledging support to and en
forcement of the prohibition law.
ELKINS INDORSED
FOR ANOTHER TERM
CHARLESTON, W. Va., July 11.â The
Republican State Convention which
opened here to-day had the largest at
tendance in the history oC the party in
this State. In addition to the nomination
of a State ticket, the convention marks
the opening of the Presidential campaign
and the canvass of Hon. Stephen B. El
kins as Senator. When the Republicans
carried the State four years ago the plu
rality was close and the margin in the
Legislature was so slight as to be in dis
pute.
Congressman Freer was unanlmously
elected permanent chairman of to-day's
convention. The resolutions reaffirm the'
Philadelphia platform, pledge loyal sup
port to McKinley and Roosevelt and in
dorse Senators Elklns and Scott and Con
gressmen Dovener, Dayton and Freer.
Senator Elkins Is especially indorsed for
re-election. Albert H. White was nomi
nated for Governor by acclamation.
In a speech before the convention Sena
tor Elkins said:
"The Republican party appeals to the
people for a continuance of confidence
not onlv on the record ltJias made in the
cast but on what it Is doirtg now and what
it proposes to do in the future. The his
torv of the Republican party for the last
fortv years is substantially the history
of tf e nation's progress during this period
âthe greatest in the history of any coun-
r "The Democratic party should not be
trusted in the policies it has advocated
and the record it has made. During the
last forty years It had control of the Gov
ernment'In all its branches only once, the
four years from 1892 to 1S9C. The effect of
Democratic legislation during these four
years casts the darkest shadow that rests
upon the prosperity and progress of the
"The "Democratic platform adopted at
the Kansas City convention Indorses the
Chicago platform, with its attack upon
the Supreme Court. It Is both reactionary
and revolutionary. It should be', consid
ered as part of the Populist party's plat
form adopted at Sioux Falls. Bryan Is
both Populist and Democrat.
"McKinley and Roosevelt will sweep the
country. The Democrats at the Kansas
City convention dug the grave of the
Democratic party and prepared its corpse
for burial by nominating a candidate once
defeated on a platform already repudiated
by the people."
EAST BIDS FOR THE
BRYAN NOTIFICATION
BUFFALO, N. Y., July 11.â National
Committeeman Norman E. Mack said to
day:
"Unless Mr. . Bryan desires the notifica
tion made In a Western city. I should
prefer that It be made In one of the large
cities of the Middle States. Naturally
I would favor New York, because of its
Importance as a political and commercial
center. New York probably will go into
the Democratic column In the coming elec
tion and Democrats in this section of the
country would like to have the honor of
having Mr. , Bryan notified In the East,
especially aS the West has had the con
vention which nominated him." 7
CANTON PREPARING
FOR A LARGE CROWD
CANTON, Ohio, July 11.â Preparations
have about been completed for the notifi
cation of President McKinley of his re
nomination. Two large flags, one covering
the upper portion and the other draped
over the awnings of the President's home
on North Market street, are all the decor
ations that will meet the eyes of the visi
tors. Back of the house a large tent has
been put up. and ' here the notification
committee will have luncheon, afterthe
ceremonies arc completed. The speaking
will take place Â¦ < ronv the famous* front
porch of the McKinley residence, unless
the weather prevents, in which event the
opera-house will be used.
Canton is getting ready for a large
crowd. The local committee having
charge of the arrangements says the no
tification will be much more of an event
than It was four years ago. and that a
larger number of people will be present
than on that occasion. It is probable that
a number of speeches besides those of
Senator Lodge and President McKinley
will be made. Senator Hanna. Senator
Fairbanks and Representative Taylor of
this Congressional district are to be called
upon for short addresses.
The business houses of Canton are to be
closed for part of the day to afford em
ployes an opportunity to participate in the
demonstration to their townsman.
The? publication of the alleged plot
against President McKinley has not dis
turbed him in the least.

No Gold Democratic Ticket.
LOUISVILLE, July 11.â General Simon
Bolivar Buckner, who was General
Palmer's running-mate on the gold ticket
in 1896, has come out against the nom
ination of a ticket this year. General
Buckner favors adopting a platform de
nouncing free silver and not nominating
a ticket, leaving the Gold Democrats free
to vote as they choose.

PAOLA, Kan.. July 11.âEx-Congress
man M. S. Peters of Kansas City was

A DISCOVERY of considerable scien
tific interest as well as of great
commercial value has just been
made on the Island of Hawaii, the
largest of the Hawaiian group. Immense
subterranean streams of the purest
water have been uncovered from 1500 to
2000 feet above the sea level. This water
will be flumed down to the sugar planta
tions at lower elevations, affording
abundance for irrigation. From five sub
terranean streams tapped within the past
few weeks the Olaa plantation has se
cured a continuous flow of from 16.000,000
to 20.0iJ0.000 gallons every twenty-four
hours, more than enough to irrigate the
immense plantation, which Is the largest
In the islands.
Manager McStocker of the Olaa planta
tion made the fortunate discovery, which
will, it is estimated, save the plantation
more than $500,000, which it "would have
been necessary' otherwise to expend for
artesian wells and costly pumping ma
chinery. In his exploration of the im
mense lava beds that cover the slopes of
Mouna Loa he found Indications of water
that led him to make experiments. A
force of men was set to work to clear
the heavy undergrowth from the land and
then, by means of giant powder, a-con
siderable excavation was made. When
the walls of the hidden watercourse were
broken through the water gushed out as
if from a spring. Gradually the hole was
enlarged, until the entire stream was di
verted from its course and made to flow
over the surface. The stream from the
llrst well, which Is 2000 feet above the sea
level, amounts to 5,750.000 gallons per
twenty-four hours; No. 2, at an elevation
of 2000 feet, flows 4,250,000 gallons per
twenty-four hours; No. 3, 2,SOO,000 gallons;
No. 4," 2,000,000 gallons, and No. 5, 1,750,000
gallons.
The water Is surface water and of the
The plantation known as Olaa covers
about 20.000 acres of what was formerly
coffee land within a few miles of Hilo.
The first crop, from 4500 acres, will be cut
in .1902. Within ten years it is expected
that the plantation will produce from 50,
000 to 60,000 tons of sugar annually.
most valuable sort for irrigation pur
poses. The rainfall In that region
amounts to from 150 to ISO inches per
.year, but the nature of the soil Is such
that it is quickly absorbedâ so eiuickly, in
fact, that the soil seems to be dry even
after the heaviest rains. The drainage is
through subterranean waterways in the
beds of very ancient lava flows that were
covered over centuries ago by layers of
disintegrated lava and sand, now over
grown with tropical vegetation.
The wells openeel are back from the sea
from twelve to fifteen miles. The con
struction of flumes to the plantation has
already been begun and within a few
weeks the water will be available.

The Populi?t convention was called to
order this afternoon by Chairman Ed
miston with lit*) delegates present.
Chairman Kdmiston's opening address
urged that the delegates work in unity In
the Interest* of the reform forces. His
reference to William J. Bryan as "that
liobl* nan, That free man, who represents
the Interests of common humanity" was
enthusiastically cheered.
Allen Elected Chairman..
Nominations were then in order for
temporary chairman and the radical and
conservative elements at ence clashed. M.
K. Harrington, representing the radical
element of the party. Senator Allen and
*x-Lieutenant Governor Harris were nom
inated, but the latter withdrew. Afttr
considerable debate the roll was ordered,
resulting: All*n 659, Harrington 4isi. Sen
ator Allen, on taking the chair, made a
plea for harmony and conservatism. A
motion to makt- the temporary organ
ization permanent was carried.
The convention then got into another
wrangle over the selection of the usual
commiUve on conference with the Demo
crats and" Silver Republicans, the far
Â¦western counties, where the middle-of
the-road movement is strong, insisting on
the election of the committee by Congres
sional districts instead of leaving the ap
pointments to the cha-ir. This movement
linally prevailed. After the announce
ment of the committees on platform and
rules and order of business the six Con
gressional districts' elected members of
the conference committee. The conven
tion then took a recess until 8 p. m.
None of the committees were ready to Â¦
rfport when the convention reassembled
this evening, and after waiting forty-flve |
minutes the selection of the State Central j
Committee was taken up. The convention
then listened to speeches until 10 p. m..

Charles A. Towne was Introduced amid
tremendous cheering and addressed the
convention for ten minutes, ending with

Just as he concluded W. J. Bryan entered j
the building and for ten minutes the con- j

Work of the Democrats.
It was nearly 3 o'clock when Chairman
Hall of the Democratic State Committee
rapped for order and introduced as tern- |
porary chairman T. J. Doyle of Lincoln.
Chairman Doyle made an address of cor- j
Fid<rab!e length. His incidental reference J
to William J. Uryan brought out the first j
applause of the convention. Following j
the appointment of a committee on ere- j
rif-nHsls and an unsuccessful attempt to
take a r'-ce-ss cf an hour W. D. Olham
and R. S. Bibb of Beatrice addressed the !
convention.
Mr Bibb four years ngo repudiated the i

LINCOLN, July 11.â The fusion forces
of Nebraska, including the Democratic.
Populist and Silver Republican parties,
held tbeir State conventions here to-day
to nominate a full electoral and State
ticket. Some bitterness was evident
among- the Populists over the defeat of
Iheir Vice Presidential candidateâ Charles

convention and up to a late hour littie
had been accomplished by the conference
committee of tne three parties, which was
to decide en the apportionment of the of

ISSUES REPUBLICANS
WILL PUT FORWARD
CANTON. Ohio. July 11.â "You can say
that we cf the East are pleased with both
conventions," said Postmaster General
Smith when asked to say something on
the political situation.
"What kind of a campaign do you ex
pect?"' was asked.
"I look for a very active campaign all
along the Ihne. with much speaking. The
general speaking, I believe, will not com
mence much before the 1st of September,
but between now and then there will be
an occasional address by Mr. Roosevelt
and, possibly, others."
"Along what lines do you expect ths
campaign to be fought?"
"I think the contest will settle down to
virtually two issues. One of these,
probably the chief one, will be the cur
rency question. The Democratic conven
tion has made it so. They refused to ac
cept the verdict of four years ago. They
have proclaimed their stand /for silver,
and the battle of four years ago on that
question will have to be fought over.
There is no such Issue as imperialism.
That is a liction. There can be no imper
ialism in a free country. But the ques
tion of upholding and strengthening the
Government in dealing with the Issues
growing out of the war. and in adminis
tering the new peoples brought under our
care and protection, is an important issue
and will ligure conspicuously in the cam
paign."
"To what extent will the trust question
enter into the campaign?"
"Not to a groat extent. In my opinion
It is a business question rather than a
political one. and the Republican party
has declared in favor of such legislation
as will correct any evils that may exist
and control harmful combinations as
clearly and as forcibly as any party can
In honesty and fairness."
"What of the political situation In
China?"
'â¢ "It seems to be clearing. We are hope
ful that it has improved. We have not
had any definite communication, but re
ports indicate the safety of the Ministers
on July 4 or 5. and if they were safe
then there is reason to hope they are
still safe. K,very day they hold out adds to
the hope of ultimate relief."
"Do you think the Chinese question will
enter into the campaign?"

PRESIDENT M'KINLEY
TO MAKE NO SPEECHES
Â«Â£ ANTOXf Â° - July "âThe campaign of
l!K>0 in Canton will not be a duplicate of
the campaign of 1S96. It is not the present
intention of Mr. McKinley to make
speeches to delegation*! who may visit
Canton during the summer and /all, even
if he should remain here all the time'. Tho
President will be so much occupied with
public business that he will hav.-Â»
l:;tle time to de\oie to the campaign. He
says his position is much different tram
that of four years ago. Then he was a
private citizen, and, as the candidate of
nis party, felt Justified in taking the ac
tive part he did in the campaign. Now
he is President of the whole people and
feels that he should give his attention to
the many questions of government pend
ing and constantly arising.
It is the present intention of the Presi
dent to confine his participation In th<
campaign to his speech to-morrow and
his letter of acceptance. Various clubs
and delegations h.-ive 'clegraphed asking
when th'\ can be received by the Presi
dent. The replies have said that the
lensth of the President's stay in Canton
Is indefinite and that he can make no ap
pointments for the reception of delega
tions. Those who call to pay their re
spects will be received at times when the
President is not engaged, as they would
ho when he is in Washington. But the
President will not make any speeches
from the front porch to delegations.

SHANGHAI, July 11.â A report from Nankin, the former capital,, just
received, reiterates the statement that the Emperor and Empress Dow
ager are both dead and that all the foreigners in Peking have been killed.
A private letter from Pelting, dated June 24 and received at Tientsin
June 30, says: "We are in danger of death. Thirty thousand -troops
are attacking and only three days' i'ood is left. No news comes of
troops. If no relief comes all seems hopeless. Maliien's store has been
burned and the -Hotel de Peking bombarded. The Italian, Dutch, American
and part of the British legations have been burned-"
This confirms Sir Robert Hart'stiespairing message of the same date.
Policy of the United States to Up
hold the "Open Door" Plan Is
LikelY to Prevent a Partition of
China by the Powers.
Governments Interested in Having Amer
ica Take the Lead Are Anxious That
the President Shall Support His Position
hy Adequate Force, .
Special Dispatch to The Call.
A' high official, in discussing the policy of the President and enunciated to thÂ«
world by Secretary Hay. pointed out that the declaration that had been made
did not necessarily make it incumbent upon this Government to go to the ex
tent of war to preserve the integrity of China. The policy of the Government
of the United States, that pronouncement stated, is to seek a solution which
may preserve a Chinese territorial and administrative safeguard for the world
in the principle of equal and impartial trade with all parts of the Chinese empire.
# "The policy adopted," continued the official, "is in keeping with that which
the United States has observed for many years and is in pursuance of the 'open
door' principle -which was in part established by the notes exchanged with for
eign powers during the past winter. It is the belief of this Government that the
declaration of the United States, supported by Great Britain. Japan and Ger
many (I don't believe there is a word of truth in the report that an agreement
in regard to China exists between that Government and Russia), will be*respected
by other nations. Aside from the natural desire to see the integrity of China pre
served this Government, looking at the matter from a commercial point of view,
understands the necessity of preventing a partition. It has been suggested that
each nation should have a certain sphere to police and trade in. Suppose the
United States should get one-sixth of Chinaâ it would have the right to trade,
with 50.000.000 of people under such conditions as it might impose. But the?Â»
50,000.000 would want the products of other countries which they might be able
to furnish better and cheaper than the United States and in turn America might
be able to supply certain wants to the people in their respective spheres better
and cheaper than they could do. Then there wotild always be constant wrangling
over the boundaries of spheres and in case of war the victor would want to
take the sphere belonging to the conquered nation. Commercial territorial jeal
ousies that would exist foreshadow the danger of the dismemberment of China. It
may be that as a result of the present disturbance the United States may suc
ceed in obtaining an ironclad agreement under which the 'open door' principle
will be firmly established, and if thi3 be so the dangerous situation with which we
are now dealing will not have arisen In vain.
Considerable gratification is expressed in official circles over the appointment
of Dr. Mumm von Schwarzenstein as German Minister to China In succession
of the late Baron von Ketteler. This action is important, indicating the purpose
of Germany to maintain diplomatic relations with China, notwithstanding the
assassination of her diplomatic representative in Peking apparently with the con
nivance of the Chinese Government. The authorities say they are now satisfied
that Germany does not propose to consider that a state of -war exists and her
decision removes what might have developed into the most dangerous feature of
the Chinese question. Dr. von Schwarzenstein. was stationed here a year ago
as special envoy of his Government. * â¢ .
CALL, HEADQUARTERS, WELLINGTON HOTEL. WASHINGTON, July
11.â Those governments interested in having the United States take tne
lead in the Chinese question are anxious that the President shall supP 0 "
his position by an adequate force. This is also the view of Re <* r
Admiral Kempff, who has just been superceded in command of tne
American fleet in Ohinese waters by Rear Admiral Remey. The desperate
nature ot the ltarhting around Tientsin and that which occurred between
that point and Peking is undoubtedly the cause of the urgent recommenda
tion made by Admiral Kempff. submitted, as is believed here, after he had con
sulted with Captain McCalla. who was with Vice Admiral Seymour's column.
Diplomats, especially those who are susjtfcious of every move Russia make?,
look farther ahead, however, and say that if the American Government 13 to
continue to take the lead as it has begun it must have a string military force
on hand to morally support the position it has assumed. Officials of the admin
istration think, however, that 11,000 men are sufficient to protect the interests of
the United States.
RENEWAL OF REPORTS OF MASSACRE AT PEKING
Forward Movement of the Allied Forces

Thousand Troops Required ThereâLi
Hung Chang to Break News of Tragedu,
It Is Eighteen Days Since the
Last Direct Message Came From
the Besieged Europeans in the
Chinese Capital.
GENERAL MA DEFEATS fiLLIED TROOPS.
LONDON. Juiy 12.â The Express this morning publishes a dispatch from
Tientsin dated Friday last, via Cht-fu, saying: "General Ma has defeated the al
lied troops 3nd reoceupied the Chinese eastern arsenal after inflicting great loss
upon its defenders. The engagement lasted six hours and was fought with great
determination by both sides,. The Chinese were able eventually to utilize the
guns of the fort abutting on the city walls near the taotai's yamen, the allied
troops suffering severely from lack of heavy guns and cavalry. The Japanese
commander sent an urgent appeal to hurry reinforcements, as the allies were in
imminent danger of a general defeat."
LONDON*. July 12 <3:S0 a. m.)â The Chinese situation again bears a most
ominous aspect. KiKhteen days ago Sir. Robert Hart dispatched his last
message, m-elarint; that the situation was desperate, and since then no
word baa come from the Europeans in* Peking. According to the Daily
Mails t-'hanghai rorreFpondent Li Hung Chang has received an imperial
Â«cfT<>f ordering his immediate dc parture for Peking, presumably to break the
news of the Pekinp tragedy Ui the European powers, and in his usual role of
negotiator with Europe in difficult matters, to endeavor to act as mediator and
inert the vengeance of the powers.
""Â¦> nrM u> the grimnoss of this sug-gestion all advices from Tientsin tend to
cor.t'rm the reports of the perilous condition of the allied forces and belie the
optimistic <hincw rumors. Unless reinforcements speedily reach Tientsin another
CiMMtiter rxxay bo expected.
The Daily Mail's Tientsin correspondent, telegraphing on July 5, says. "The
Fii-.j?.iinn is about as bad as it can well T>e. I only trust that we shall not soon
v. ni relieving ourselves. A forward movement is impossible. From 30,000 to
ICjOM troops .ire cranled, and there are now op.ly 10,<W here. The foreign troops are
Â¦woriTins well together, but it is inconvenient that there is no .supreme com
mander. In some quarters the feeling iÂ«. 'Let us rescue Peking and then clear
out in favor of Hussia.' " â¢/
Othrr Tientsin correspondents say that no advance is possible until Septem
ber 1. ;md explanations are. being asked by the papers here for the tardy action
of J;jpan In sending troop?, since it is known that she was ready and willing to
pond then; and Russia raised no objection to her doing fn. It Is hinte<l that
difiK ulty arose as to the manner in which Japan was to be recouped for her
heavy outlay. Humors are current that Japan demanded the cession of a Chi
nos<- i)on.
The Russian papers report that the Boxers are ravaging Manchuria and
have damaged sixty miles of railway, threatening Telin and Kirin. while Port
Arthur and Neu <"hwang are said to be endangered. Russia, therefore, has noti
fied the powers nf her intention to dispatch a large military force to Manchuria.
It appears that the Russian censorship is suppressing all rofercnc-c to this mat
ter. ;usd it transpires that tW) reprular troops have already arrived from Port
Arthur and Amur to protect the Manchuria railway, and that other troops are
now on their way to Manchuria.
All kinds of stories come from Shanghai, which it is impossible to verify. It
if stated that the Boxera have murdered the chancellor of the Peking I'ni
versitv and sixty member? of his family and retainers. A eontidential officer of
General Yunj Lu. disguised as a Boxer, is reported to have crept into Prince
Tuan's tent while the Prince was sleeping, with the intention i?f stabbing lum.
He was caught by the sentries, so tliÂ« story goes, and decapitated on the spot.
His bead was sent, with Prince Tuan'-s compliments, to Yung Lu as a warning
to him to beware.
The French Consul at Shanghai has news that the Chinese prefect at Moukden
himself murdered the Catholic Bishop Guilton, in his Yamen. Besides Bishop
GuiHon. Fathers Crunoet, Corbet, Bourgeois and Villenot and two sisters of the
French mission and numerous native Christians were massacred.
From Canton comes a report of large desertions from the German-Chinese
regiment at Kaiochau. and of a riot between German troops and Boxers,
iriar.y of the latter being killed.
Both at Shanghai and Canton apprehension exists that, these evidences of a
widespread native rebellion indicate the necessity for immediate measures on,
the part of the powers.
It is stated that Germany intends to send to China 10,000 to 15,000 men, .well
equipped with guns.

WASHINGTON, July 11.â Minister Wu
Ting Fang has acted with characteristic
energy in respect to the requests of sev
eral Washington citizens who desired it
to become known that rewards would be
paid for the rescue of Americans now in
Peking. Among the Washingtonians who
caller] on the Minister were Mrs. L. A.
Crandall and* Miss Carrie Harrison, who
are especially fearful for the safety of

MINES DESTROYED
BY MANCHU TROOPS
LONDON, July 12.â Tho Shanghai cor
rrspondein of the London Express give.-;'
the text of a long edict of Prince Tuan.
dated June 2S. and addressed to the Chi
nese Emba.^adors, which the Express de- j
dares is identical with the message from
Kmperor Kwung Hsu. mentioned by tho
correspondent of the Dally Mail
and with the Chinese edict published in
Washington. The Express considers that
the edict proves that I'lince Tuan's party
is making no attempt to disffu!se the fact
that the worst that could be anticipated
has happened.
The edict contains the following para
graphs: "The anger of our peonlt knew
nÂ«> bounds. They could n<it be restrained.
The task of guarding the lesations. which
before was difficult, was made more im
possible."
Klst-whr-re. referring to the desire to
protect the legations still unharmed it
says: "If it is impossible for us to con
tinue this protection let it l>c represented
to the powers that we must be held
Mamelens. for the anger of our people
grows with the rising of each sun that
Â¦ees more and yet more foreigners and
Boltften come to overrun and lay waste
our country and slay opr people."
The correspondent say* the edict is in
tended lo pave the way for a linal lifting
of the vÂ»il over the recent history el
Peking.

STILL WAITING FOR
NEWS FROM CONGER
WASHINGTON. July 11.â Aside from
the dispatch from Admiral Remey, made
public thi3 afternoon, there was no news
received to-day by the administration
from the representatives of the Govern
ment in China. The desire to hear from
Minister : Conger remains unabated, and
It is presumed that Minister Wu. the
Chinese Minister, will make some further
effort to obtain for the Ministers the op
portunity of communicating directly
with their own governments. Like the of
ficials in Washington, he Is at a loss to un
derstand whyjthey are not able to do so.
He was asked to-night if the administra
tion had suggested to him that he call
the attention of his government that it
was the desire of our officials that com
munication be arranged for. but he de
clined to say. Minister Wu, in connection
with the statement contained in the im
perial decree made public to-day, called
attention to the fact that when particu
lars of the murder of Baron von Ketteler
were published it was stated that the
guard in revenge had burned the offices
of the Tsung-li Yamen. The decree con
tained no .mention of this, which is re
garded as singular, if such a thins had
occurred. To his mind It refuted the
original story, which, he said, like many
others inimical to the Chinese govern
ment, had originated at Shanghai and
other places. :
The Minister believed that the 20.000
Japanese troops would have no great dif
ficulty in reaching Peking. "I believe
they will pet there, if they have the cour
age to go." he added. "Ten thousand
disciplined men could go to Peking.' I
don"t think there could be any doubt
about that."
The Minister's confidence In this regard,
however, is not shared by persons here
familiar with the conditions that woulQ
be met between Tientsin and Peking;
partly, at least, because of the physical
conditions to be overcome by the invading
army.
At the Japanese Legation to-day it was
said that nothing was known there of the
report that Japan was preparing to send
a much Marper force to China than had
been originally intended, but confidence
was expressed that the government would
dispatch whatever men were necessary to
accomplish the object Japan is endeavor
ing' to attain.

GERMANY NOT AT
WAR WITH CHINA
BERLIN, July 11.â The Government says
the Chinese situation to-day was virtu
ally unchanged. No authentic news has
been received from Peking, and the news
from Tientsin is if anything worse. Ac
cording* to. the semi-official Post, Emperor
William's trip to Norway will last till
August 6, unless the weightiest news ar
rives requiring his hasty return/ .
Dr. Mumm von Schwarzenstein's ap
pointment, as Minister to .China is inter
preted in political circles here as a proof
that Germany regards herself 'as not at
war with China. The appointment is;
meant especially for Russia, to show that
Germany means to continue her ChinesÂ©
policy with Russia. The new Minister,
who is considered one of the most promis
ing German diplomats, and who until "how
it .was generally supposed would succeeed
Dr. von Holleben at Washington, prompt
ly declared that he was reagy to assume
the dangerous mission at the Emperor's
personal desire. >
- At the Chinese legation here to-day a

was informed that the Viceroys had sent
information that the% rising had declined
and would soon be quelled. -The legation
officials do not believe the other Ministers
at Peking have been murdered. Baron

does^iot mean that the Chinese anti-for

Asiatic station, having arrived in Chinese
waters, Is in command over the head. of
Admiral Kempff, whom he ranks. It is
believed that his cablegram this morning
relating to the landing of the Ninth-In
fantry has lost a date line, for it is not
doubted that the troops were landed at
Taku instead of Chefu, as his message
reads.
Admiral Kempff has scored another
credit through the formal statement by
the Chinese Government that the bom
bardment of the forts at Taku, which was
done over his protest and without his par
ticipation, precipitated the crisis at
Peking.
Quartermaster General Ludington has
been making inquiry as to the character

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL; THURSDAY, eTULY 12, l/JOO.
WASHINGTON, July 11.â An im
perial decree dated the third day
of the sixth moon (June 29) was
received by telegraph to-day by
Minister Wu from the Taotai of
Shanghai, transmitted on July 1 from the
Treasurer of the Chili province, who
received it by special courier on June 30
from the Board of War, who in turn re
ceived it from the Privy Council in Pe
king. The decree is as follows:
The circumstances which led to the com
mencement of fighting between the Chinese and
foreigners were of such a complex, confusing
and unfortunate character as to be entirely un
expected. Our diplomatic ' representatives
abroad owing to their distance from the scene
of action, have had no means of knowing the
true- state 'of things and according^ cannot
lay the views of the Government Tiefore the
Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the respective
powers to which they are accredited. Now, we
take this opportunity of going fully into the
matter for the information of our representa
tives aforesaid.
In the first place there arose in the provinces
of Chill and Shantung a band of rebellious
subjects who had been in the habit of prac
ticing boxing and fencing in their respective
villages and at the same time clothing their
doings with spiritual and strange rites. The
local authorities failed to take due notice of
them at the time. Accoralngly the infection
spread with astonishing rapidity. Within the
sjvace of a month it seemed to make its ap
pearance everywhere and finally even reached
the capital Itself. Kvery one looked upon the
movement as supernatural and strange and
many joined it.
"Down With Christianity."
Then there were lawless and treacherous
persons who sounded the cry of "Down with
Christianity'.'.' About the middle of the fifth
moon these persons began to create disturb
ances without warning. Churches were burned
and converts were killed. The whole city was
in a ferment. A situation was created which
could not be brought under control. At first
the foreign powers requested that foreign
troops be allowed to enter the capital for the
protection of the legations. The imperial Gov
ernment, having In view the comparative, ur
gency of the occasion, granted the request as
an-~fxtraordlnary mark of courtesy beyond the
requirements of international Intercourse. Over
.-<*> foreign troops were sent to Peking. This
shows clearly how much care China exercises
In the maintenance of friendly relations with
other countries. The legations at the capital
never had much to do with the people. But
from the time foreign troops entered the city
the guards did not devote themselves exclu
sively to the protection of their respective le
gations. They sometimes fired their guns on
the top of the city walls and sometimes pa
trolled the streets everywhere.
Hit by Stray Bullets.
There were -reports of persons being hit by
stray bullets. Moreover, they strolled about
the city without restraint, and even attempted
to enter the Tsung Hua gate {the eastern gate
of the palace grounds).- They only desisted
when advance was positively forbidden.. On this
account both the soldiers and the people were
provoked to resentment, and voiced their indig
nation with one accord. Ijawless persons then
took advantage of the situation to do mischiei
and became bolder than ever In burning and
killing Christian converts. The powers there
upon attempted to reinforce the foreign troops
in Peking, but the reinforcements encountered
resistance and defeat at the hands of the in
surgents on the way and have not yet been
able to proceed. The insurgents of the two
provinces of Chill and Shantung had by this
time effected a complete union and could not
be separated. The Imperial Government was
by no means reluctant to issue orders for the
entire suppression of this insurgent element.
But as the trouble was so near at hand; there
was a ereat fear that due protection might
not be assured to the legations, if the anarch
ists should be driven to extremities, thus
bringing on a national calamity. There also
was a fear that uprisings might occur in the
provinces of Chili and Shantung at the same
time, with the reÂ»ult that 'both foreign mis
sionaries and Chinese converts in the twa
provinces might fall victims to popular fury.
It was. therefore, absolutely necessary* to con
sider the matter from every point of view.
Murder of German Minister.
An a measure of precaution it was finally de
cided to request the foreign Ministers to retire
temporarily to Tientsin for safety. It was
while the discussion of this proposition was In
progress that the German Minister, Haron von
Ketteler. was assassins ted r by a riotous mob
one morning while on his way to thÂ«> Tsung-11
Vamon. On the previous day the German Min
ister had written a letter appointing a time for
calling at the Tsung-ll Yamen. But the Ya
men, fearing he might be molested on the way,
did not consent to the appointment as sug
gested by the Minister. Since this occurrence
the anarchists assumed a more bold and threat
ening attitude and consequently it was not
deemed wise to carry out the project of sending
the diplomatic corps to Tientsin under an ep
cort. However, orders were Issued to the troops
detailed for the protection of the legations to
keep stricter watch and take greater precau
tions against any emergency.
Attack on Taku Forts.
To our surprise, on the 20th of the fifth moon
(June 16) foreign (naval) officers at Taku called
on Lo Jung Kwang; the general commanding,
and demanded his surrender of the forts, noti
fying him that falling to receive compliance
they would at 2 o"clock of the next day take steps
to seize the forts by force. Ia Jung Kwang, be
ing bound by the duties of his office to hold the
forts, how could he accede to the demand? On
the day named' they actually first fired on the
forts, which responded and kept up the fighting
all day and then surrendered. Thus the con
flict of forces began, but certainly the initia
tive did not come from our side.
Even supposing that China, were not con
scious of her -true condition, how could she
take such a step as to engage in war with all
the powers simultaneously, and how could she,
relying upon the support of an anarchistic
The document gave great satisfaction
here, as It showed, assuming there was
some foundation for the rlrst reports that
the Imperial Government had encouraged
the Boxers and even participated in the
attacks on the legations, that an effort
is about to' be made to retrieve that mis
take. The note is said to have originated
with the Privy Council and at the State
Department this body is declared to be
identical with the Tsimg-li Yamen. being
the power next the throne and the one
which deals exclusively with the foreign
powers'. The curious means adopted of
forwarding the note are supposed to have
been resorted to because what amounts
to martial law In civilized countries Is
now in force in Peking and Shantung, so
that the Tsung-li Yamen would naturally
confide the message to the War Board,
now in supreme control, to secure its
transmission to Shanghai. The announced
purpose of the Chinese Government to
protect the foreign Ministers is gratify
ing to the officials,' here, for they have all
along morcor less doubted the authenti
city of the several dispatches which have
emanated from, Shanghai respecting the
relations between Prince Chins and the
legations. Â»
It is said that the note does not call for
an answer from the State Department
at this stage and will not materially af
fect the military programme laid down by
our Government. Such forces as we can
land in China will be pushed forward with
rapidity to Peking. TIir only considera
tion that would induce the administration
to relax that programme at any point
would be the reopening of communication
with Minister Conprer and his release from
any sort of duress or restraint. Possibly
now that the Tsung-li Yamen is commu
nicating with the outer world it will per
mit the foreign Ministers in Peking, if
they are alive, to do the same. Our Gov
ernment probably will suggest to the
Tsung-li Yamen, through Minister Wu
here, that this be done. Much will depend
upon the response.
Gives Great Satisfaction.
The several Ministers will continue In the
discharge of the duties of their offices as hith
erto, without hesitation or debate. This tele
graphic decree to be transmitted for their In
formation.
Our several Ministers will make known accu
rately and in detail the contents of this decree
and the policy of China to the Ministers of For
eign Affairs in their respective countries and
assure them that military authorities are still
strictly enjoined to afford protection to the le
gations as hitherto, tp the utmost of their
power. As for the anarchists, they will be se
verely dealt with as circumstances permit.

DABINO JAIL BREAK.

SAN BERNARDINO, July 11.â A most
daring Jail delivery was made this morn-
Ing about 9 o'clock, when Allen Lasoard
and John Morrison, inmates of the County
Jail, made their escape from confinement.
During the daytime Jailer Shay permits
the prisoners to come out from their cells
for a promenade la the corridors and tho
usual custom was followed to-day.
After the Jailer's departure the lnmatea
named climbed upon the top of the steel
tanks and broke through the ventilators
of the roof, and tying several Â¦woolen
blankets together stretching to the earth,
a distance of over twenty feet, slid down
and took to their heels. Morrison vrsm
found burled In the grass and weeds along
the marshy;. ground of Warn Creek and
Lasoard was found not far away. Both
men were taken back to prison and placed
in steel cells.

NEW YORK. July 11.â Financial circles
exhibited much imprest to-day In the
method of paying for Klondike gold dust
consignments received at the Pacific
Coast. Five million dollars" worth of gold
consigned to New York branches of Cana
dian banks has already been announced,
remittances covering a portion of the
amount having been received in this city
yesterday. Instead of effecting payment
by dralt on the New York sub-trea*ury
the exchange was made by telegraphic
transfer by the Seattle Bank wiring Its
Iv'ew York correspondents to pay the
Canadian bank SmQlSOOl This sum prob
ably represents the face value of the
drafts given by the assay office officials
on the eub-treasury at San Francisco.
This form of payment is quite as con
venient as would be drafts against the
local sub-treasury, but does not affect
bank reserves at work in the same way.
Yesterday's payment, for instance, has not
affected reserves or deposits in New York
banks as a whole, because the deposit
Â¦was withdrawn from one bank and cred
ited In another, where the Canadian bank
kept Its account. But when the draft Is
covered by the remittance of the gold
there will be created a new deposit, with
en increase of cash surplus reserves gain
ing 75 per cent of the amount involved
as a net result of the operation.

PARIS, July 11.â The committeo to
which the Municipal Council referred tha
proposal to grant gratuitously a site
worth 400,000 francs for an American Na
tional Institute has decided to report
against the grant. The report of the com
mittee will be submitted to the^ council
probably to-morrow and a vote" will be
taken which will determine the fate of
the proposed institute. The committee's
important decision Is the outcome of the
opposition of the Councilor, Charles For
tin, who submitted a resolution annulling
tho action of the Council last year, when
the site was actually voted. He protested
vigorously against the gift as being an
tagonistic to the interests of French ar
tists, who, he claimed, are not treated as
well in America as Americans are treated
here. His counter proposal lapsed, owing
to the dissolution of the council. But at
the National victory at the late elections
he renewed it, and the matter *was re
ferred to a committee which decided as
already cabled. The committee's report
sets forth that no document was fur
nished It regarding the authorization of
the Government by the State of New
York and that there is nothing to show
the attitude to be assumed toward the
institute by the other States of the Union.
On the other hand, it Is added, the docu
ments submitted to the committee would
indicate that the institute is really a
private enterprise, partly supported by
gifts from generous- benefactors, but
mainly by fees for board and lodging to
be paid by the students. < â¢
The report also quoted an American
pamphlet and a letter from . Archbishop
Ireland In support of the conclusion of
\he committee that the institute is
"purely a commercial undertaking." The
report ends with saying:
While we must rejoice to see foreigners come
to Paris to study the works of our artists and
learned men, yet this instruction ought not to
be obtained at the expense of our finances,
which are Â«o Impoverished, whenever it Is a
question of encouraging our own countrymen.
Moreover. . If, ever artists Â¦ wish to become
known in America and create outlets there
for their works, their aspirations are j quickly
crushed by heavy custom* duties, often equal

PROSECUTION BACKED
BY MILLIONAIRE GATES
Opening of the Trial of Alexander
Jester for a Murder of Twenty-
Nine Years Ago.
NEW LONDON. Mo., July 11.â
The taJclng of testimony in the
trial of Alexander "Jester for tho
murder of Gilbert W. Gates, twÂ«ny
nlne years ago, began to-day. The
only witness called to-day was Ansel A-
Gates, SI years of age, father of the mur
dered man. Mr. Gates told in detail of
his search for his son in 1S71, through
Southern Kansas and Missouri, and of the
subsequent arrest of Jester, in whose pos
session were found his son's wagon and
personal effects. The aged witness broke
down and cried while examining and iden
tifying some of these articles, which have
been preserved through the many years
axid which were to-day offered in evidence
against the accused man. Mr. Gates iden
tified Jester as the man arrested in 1871
as a result of his search, and who sub
sequently broke Jail before he could be
brought to trial.
When the attorneys for the defense, ear
lier in the day. stated their case to the
Jury of twelve fanners, they made It
plain that one of the features of the de
fense would be an attempt to show that
the case against the prisoner had been
worked jup by men in the hire of John
\V. Gates, the millionaire steel man.
whose brother the murdered man warn.
The prosecution does not deny that Mr.
Gates has paid the expenses of the wit
nesses from a distance and that the hotels
are keeping them at his expense.
POWERS' MOTION FOR
CONTINUANCE DENIED
Court Orders the Trial of Kentucky's
ex-Secretary of State to
Proceed.
GEORGETOWN, Ky., July 11.â The mo
tion of the defense for a continuance in
the case of ex-Secretary of State Caleb
Powers, charged with being an accessory'
to the Goebel murder, came up before
Judge Cantrill this morning. Common
wealth's Attorney Franklin, in presenting
the objections of the prosecution, claimed
that the defendant had not exercised dua
diligence to get his witnesses here.
Ex-Governor Brown, for the defense, re
plied that the affidavits filed show abun
dance of cause for a continuance and as
serted that a trial under the circum
stances would be so much labor lost, as
the higher courts would certainly reverse
the verdict on the ground of error.
The motion for a continuance was over
ruled, the court finding that it was the
fault of the defense that witnesses were
not present. The court notified the de
fense that they might have attachments
Issued, returnable Tuesday, for all absent
witnesses, and said special bailiffs would
be provided and compulsory processes
granted In order to bring witnesses here
if it were desired.
At the afternoon session of the court
the defense filed a special demurrer to tho
Indictment against Powers, holding that it
Is Invalid because It names Powers as an
accessory and does not name a principal.

IX)NDOX, July 11.â The Queen's garden
party at Buckingham Palace to-day was
an especially brilliant function. Her Ma
jesty came from Windsor to attend the
party and drove about among the thou
sands of guests, who included the mem
bers of the royal family, the diplomatic
corps and other distinguished people. The
members of the United States Embassy
and the consulate were present in full
strength.
The garden party gave rise to, an ex
traordinary scene in the House of Com
mons. The U3ual humdrum Wednesday
business was in progress, when an ad
journment was moved to enable the mem
bers to attend the function at Bucking
ham Palace. John Dillon. Irish Nation
alist, objected, saying that business in
terfered with such a purpose. Fred Mad
dison. Radical, who followed, protested
in an excited manner against what he
considered to be "flagrant abuse of gov
ernmental power and gross waste of the
time of the House." He declared that a
single clause of the agricultural holdings
bill, then under consideration, was worth
more than all the royal parties with all
"the royalty thrown in."
LONDON, July U.â "William "Waldorf
Astor'B sudden departure for Ger
many at the very height of the sea-
Bon, the canceling of all his en
gagements here and the recall of
the invitations which he had Issued for
house parties on next Sunday and on Sun
day week at Cliveden are universally re
garded as signalizing the close of his so
cial career In London. It is openly de
clared here that the Prince of "Wales,
who is the supremo arbiter of English
society, has cut him. In consequence of his
insulting treatment of Captain Sir Milne
last week, and London is only too ready
to take its cue in this mutter from its
future King, as Mr. Astor in spite of his
wealth and of the magnificence of his en
tertainments has made many enemies by
his numerous Idiosyncrasies and by his
extraordinary arrogance.
Confirmation is given to these stories of
Mr. Astor's fall from royal favor by tho
fact that his name is conspicuously absent
from the list of guests who attended the
Queen's garden party at Buckingham Pal
ace to-day, for which over a thousand in
vitations had been Issued.
Astor raised the question of his Ameri
can citizenship by his recent visit to New
York. In his luxuriant London surround
ings, purchased by the millions amassed
by his ancestors, he became extremely
vexed by the assessment of heavy per
sonal taxes upon him as a citizen of the
TTnited States. And bo he went to
New York "to learn what rights ho had
In that country." Ever since he took up his
residence In London In 1S90 Mr. Astor has
paid personal taxes In New York on prop
erty valuation of $2,000,000 without com
plaint. Other wealthy men have dodged
this obligation, as Mr. Astor might havo
done, by declaring residence abroad. Mr.
Astor's removal to make his home in Eng
land has always brought forth wide com
ment. It Is said that balked political am
bition and dissatisfaction with. New York
social life drove him to his splendid exile.
After serving as a member of the State
SAN JOSE, July 11.â An Investigation
into the two accidental deaths at AgnewB
Asylum last Sunday was conducted at
that institution to-day by the boaxd of
managers, who met there In regular ses
sion. The full board was present.
The deaths referred to were those of
G. A. Morss of Alameda, an Inmate, who
was boiled to death in a bathtub through
the carelessness of an attendant, and the
suicide of C. J. Singleton of San Fran
cisco, who Jumped from a window in the
second story.
Both accidents were the result of cul
pable negligence on the part of attend
ants. The investigation consisted in hear
ing the officials of the institution. After
this testimony and the statement by Dr.
Crane that both attendants implicated in
the carelessness that resulted in the acci
dents had been discharged, the board
unanimously adopted the following 1 reso
lutions exonerating the officials of the
asylum:
"With reference to the deaths of In-
I mates C. J. Singleton and G. A. Morss
; at Agnews Hospital on July 8, the board
of managers, after a careful and soarch-
I ing investigation info the cause of the
i fame, do lu-reby recommend that the of
licers of the hospital be exonerated from
all blame in the matter, but do censure
the attendants, U. C. O'Brien and G. \V.
Allen, for gross carelessness and negli
gence, and indorse the action of the su
perintendent, Dr. Crane, in their prompt
dismissal."
Medical Director Crane. Drs. Stocking
and Marvin and Supervisor Wilson were
examined in regard to the accidental
deaths. They knew none of the facts
arising from the carelessness of attend
ants but what Attendants Allen and
O'Brien had told them. | The attendants
were the only witnesses in both cases,
ar.d the facts as already published were
I related by the witnesses called to-day.
The managers then took up the charges
of cruelty which had been made to the
State Lunacy Commission In reference to
the treatment of Rose Tannebaum, a pa
tient, by her relatives. Dr. Crane. Assist
ant Physicians Stocking and Marvin and
the matron, Miss Fitzgerald, were exam
ined. They all gave practically the same
testimony. It was that Misa Tannebaum
was badly bruised when she came to the
asylum. They declared that Miss Tanne
baum was in the habit of fighting with
the oth^r patients and was always bruised
up. If she passed any patients she struck
them and thev hit back in return before
the attendant" could separate them. The
managers deemed this explanation suffi
cient. Dr. Crane, however, courted fur
ther investigation. He wanted the board
to fullv examine into the matter, and of
fered to call every employe of the hos
pital to prove these statements. The
managers declined to go any further Into
the matter and adopted the following res
olution unanimously:
'â¢After due investigation, the board finds
that in the case of Miss Tannebaum that
the officers and employes of the asylum
used reasonable efforts to afford proper
care and treatment of the patient, Rosa
Tannebaum. and no Just cause of com
plaint exists against said officers or em
ployes."
The board of managers of Agnews Asy
lum are considering the matter of pro
viding employment of some kind for the
inmates. Manager Hale reported that at
other asylums in the State the Inmates
are engaged In producing articles for use
in the institution. At Napa brick Is man
ufactured and at Stockton shoes. He
suggested that something of the kind
might be done at Agnews, and this mat
ter will be taken up by the managera.
Medical Director Crane reported that
there were 1004 patients in the hospital
June 30. of which number 419 were fe
males.

REDDING, July 1Lâ The spreading of
rails on a temporarily repaired piece of
track seven miles above Delta, in extreme
northern Shasta County, this morning at
8:30 o'clock, caused the rear Pullman of the
southbound Shasta Express to pitch down
a sixty-foot embankment. Nothing but a
monster rock upon which the car became
impaled saved it and its ten occupants
from being dashed into the Sacramento
River far below. The car turned com
pletely over, landing against the rock
upon its side, where It hung nervously
upon the verge of the precipice. The ac
cident was due to the wreck of seven
freight cars at the same point the day be
fore.
A crew had but patched up the track for
the time being. All of the b.iasta Express
except the rear car passed over it in safe
ty. None of the ten passengers within it
were killed outright, but two of them are
certain to die. The others are all more or
less injured. The fatally hurt are Mra.
Professor Pierce of Woodland and John
Almon, a colored porter. Mrs. Pierce's col
lar bone was broken and her back badly
Injured. She was also internally Injured.
Almon'B head wae crushed. Professor
Pierce'B collar bone was broken. F. L.
Bkaggs chief clerk of the St. Nicholas
Hotel, San Francisco, who says he was in
five previous accidents, was nearly suuo
cated by escaping gas. He was otherwise
unhurt. Miss Ruth Morton, 16 years old,
of Woodland, had her hand badly cut. Her
brother, R. G. Morton, was slightly in
jured. R. V. Ellis and hia sister, Helen
Ellis of Hanford, were considerably
bruised, the latter having her head cut. J.
Long-street, the colored porter, had his
head cut, a rib broken and his shoulder
dislocated. Pullman Conductor Bgert and
buffet boy Woods were cut about the face
and body.
The people on the balance of the train
rescued the injured with difficulty. They
were hurried to Redding and cared for by
local physicians before being taken on.
The screams and moans were pitiful.
All of the Passeng*rs Were Injured

MRS. LEASE'S VIEW OF IT.
\A RS. MARY ELLEN LEASE of Kansas once
/ \ filled so large a place in American politics
! ' that there was not a lid in the country big
I enough to cover it. Her poses were visible and her
preaching was audible from one side of the continent
to the other. Then there came a period when the
republic had a rest. There were blizzards and thun
derstorms as of yore, but Mrs. Lease was quiet Thus
1 there came upon the people a conviction that she had
i retired from the arena of disputation and reform,
and betaken herself tc raising chickens or Belgian
hares. That belief was erroneous. The lady is still
alive and is kicking.
Her reappearance in the forefront of the gathering
i storm of the campaign is due to a discontent with
J what happened at Kansas City. Mrs. Lease likes
Bryan, but she likes Populism more, and she has a
suspicion that* Bryanism is but the whiskers of Popu
j Iism without the spirit. Consequently she has arisen
to give her opinion of the Kansas City convention
and it is an opinion that does her credit. She is re
ported to have said this about the thing:

PERSONAL MENTION.
Tr-;OSE PARIS COMAMSSIONS.
ONE blunder after another seems to follow in
the wake of the officials of this country at the
Paris Expojition. We have already referred
to the gross omissions of thoughtfulness on the part
of the California Commission. Furnished with car
loads of wine free by our vintners, to be used in their
official hospitalities, at the only function, so far, in
which they were hosts only foreign wines were
served. In other ways they have failed entirely to
represent the State, and have permitted the entire ex
clusion of our wines from competition.
On the heels of this comes a blunder by the Fed
eral Commissioner, Mr. Peck. The President of
France paid a visit of courtesy and ceremony to the
United States quarter and pavilion. Federal Commis
sioner General Peck was not on hand to receive him.
and he came in contact with the charwomen, sweep
ers and glass wipers employed in the place. The sec
retary of the commission was there, but could not
receive President Loubet. not having been introduced
to him. A few stray Americans who were in the place
and saw and felt the situation keenly sent a hurry
call to the United States Embassador to France and
got him there before the President had withdrawn.
General Peck is furnished with abundant means to use
in the duties, courtesies and hospitalities. So far, like
the California Commissioners, he seems to have con
tented himself with being praised by his subordinates
and drawing his pay.
The United States building was a frightful frac
ture cÂ£ all laws of taste in architecture, was unsafe for
occupancy, and had less charms than the Mechanics*
Pavilion in thiÂ« city the morning after a cake walk.
There was money enough to construct an effective
building. Why it was not done no one seems to
know, but all Americans in Paris know that it was
not, and blush for what is and sigh for what might

THE SPELLBINDERS.
IT is an old saying that there's grief enough to go
around. The hardest heart felt for the Bryan
Democracy when J. Webster Davis joined it az
Kansas City. He had been an extreme Republican,
a hre-eater as to the Philippines and all round go-it
blind partisan. He changed because the President
would not deceive the Boers by pretending that this
Government can help them against England.
The Republican party was just getting ready to
bow its acknowledgment of felicitations on beir^ rid
cf Davis, when there came to it the undeserved mis
fortune of the accession of John Barrett. It 15 now
a tie. as far as bad luck goes. Barrett knows more
things that are not so than any other man in the
country- He has been on all sides and the bottom
and the top of all reccr.t public questions. We pro
pose that the sorrows of the parties be mitigrated and
a contribution made to the humor of the campaign
by having a joint debate between Barrett and Davis,
i:i which each will draw the deadly parallel on the
other. As a show it will beat Adam Forepaugh's.

THE OPEN DOOR.
ONCE MORE THE OLD LESSON.
ONCE more the "people of California are receiv
ing costly instruction upon the subject of for
est fires. The fire record of the year has
been exceptionally disastrous in the East, and there
are portentous indications that it may be almost as
bad on the Pacific Coast. We have not yet reached
the period of the usual forest fire season, and already
a vast amount of damage has been done by such con
flagrations.
Two fires on a large scale within the State were
reported in the dispatches of yesterday. In the Santa
Cruz Mountains a fire was started by a balloon sent
up on the night of the Fourth of July. The balloon
dropped into the brush and at once there was started
a blaze which had not been extinguished at the time
the report was sent out on July 10. The dispatch
said:
"There is no foretelling when the fire will be con
trolled, in fact the general impression is that it will
burn itself out. It has already spread over thousands
of acres and as many more are doomed. No definite
estimate of the loss can be made at this time. Stand
ing timber and piles of cordwood have been destroyed
and acres of splendid pasture land are now black and
rmoking. Undoubtedly many cattle have perished,
although no direct reports of losses have been made.
Frightened animals fled before the wall of smoke and
fire and are now wandering at large among the hills.
It will be days, if not weeks, before the herds are
rounded up, and many will be woefully short."
The second report comes from Angels Camp, Cala
veras County. The fire started there on Saturday
night. In describing the fight against the flames the
report said:
"On Sunday the fire broke away again, and with a
roar like a distant cannonade started down the valley
at the base of Bear Mountain. Men, wearied with
their efforts and all-night vigils, rushed beyond to
'back fire' and try to turn the course, but before they
were aware of it a flame shot across Angels Creek
and into the treetops on the opposite side, a distance
of 300 or 400 feet. Almost immediately a cloud of
the blackest smoke rose into the air and could be*
plainly seen for miles around. All efforts to check the
fire were in vain, and it swept on for four miles to
the Stanislaus River, which it reached in two hours.
Every effort is being made to keep it from jumping
across the river, and men are stationed on Bear
Mountain to keep a close watch and sound the alarm
in the event of the fire starting up again. The ap
pearance of the country over which the fire burned
is one of desolation. Stockmen, who pasture in the
high mountains during the summer months and in the
burned section during the winter, will suffer the great
est, as the supply of giass is entirely destroyed. Un
less early rains set in the stock will suffer greatly."
Here we have two widely separated sections of the
State swept by fires of such magnitude that in each
case thousands of acres have been burned over, and
an immense loss entailed, not only of timber and of
grass, but of cattle. These two instances have been
cited simply because they are a part of the news of
the day. Many other fires of less extent have pre
ceded them, and in the aggregate the losses caused
thereby have been sufficient to teach the importance
of some system of fire prevention, even had neither of
the two conflagrations we have noted taken place.
What wisdom will the people of California learn
from these disastrous lessons? Year after year fires
sweep the forests and the fields of California. Mil
lions of dollars' worth of valuable timber goes up in
smoke and leaves nothing but a worthless ash heap.
Nor is that all. Denuding the hills and mountains of
their forests deprives them of the power to retain
moisture, and as a consequence we have torrential
streams in the wet season and arid and parched lands
in the dry season. Thus one loss brings in its train
another loss. Could the total amount of what Cali
fornia has suffered by forest fires in the last twenty
years be accurately computed, the result would be
startling and by many it would be regarded as in
credible. .
This fall the people of California are to elect mem
bers of the Legislature which will meet this winter.
If there is any wisdom learned from the fires it is now
timely to apply it. Let every candidate for the Legis*
lature be pledged to support a comprehensive system
of fire prevention. Delay is costly, far more costly
than experiments in forest preservation would be;
and. moreover, any well devised experiment of the
kind would be beneficial, while delay means a loss
that carries with it no compensation whatever.

THE GOLD DEMOCRATS.
I â \ OLITICAL interest again begins to center in
L>J the probable action of the Gold Democrats,
* who, in 1896, refused to change the historic at
titude of their party, and smote Bryan from July to
November. Their national committee meets on the
25th inst. in Indianapolis and will propose some ac
tion. Just what it will be is now not surely known.
The Kansas City platform enables a guess at what
that party will do. That platform takes pain's to an
tagonize the Indianapolis platform of 1896. It de
nounces the gold standard, raises an outcry against
banking reiorm. and demands, in effect, greenbacks,
and offensively declares for the free coinage of silver
at 16 to 1. As these matters were the points of differ
ence most discussed in 1896, it will be seen that Gold
Democrats are offered the open door into the Bryan
organization, upon tie hard condition of admitting
that they were wrong four years ago. and are or
dered to indorse in equally offensive form the pol
icies which they then refused to adopt. In addition
to the financial issues there were others raised in
the Chicago platform which were nearly as offensive
to the Gold Democrats, and upon which Mr. Bryan
laid equal stress. These have been referred to by
Abram S. Hewitt, iormer chairman of the Demo
cratic National Committee, who says: "A man like
Bryan, who denounced as government by injunction
the performance by the judiciary of duties imposed
upon it by the constitutional law of the land; who
denounced the Supreme Court, the bulwark of law
and liberty; who sought to overthrow the judiciary
of the country, is a man too limited in understanding
and too violent in impulse to be entrusted with the
great office of Presidert. The American conception
of government has always been liberty regulated by
law. The Bryan notion is despotism regulated by
anarchy."
Hon. J. Sterling Morton of Nebraska says: "The
Gold Democrats arc as firm in their conviction for
honest money and as loyal to principle as they were
in 1896. With Mr. Bryan as the nominee they will
use, with slight variation, the words he uttered at
Richmond in 1896, 'We will not come back.' The
Gold Democrats of the United States will not sup
port Bryanarchy, with or without silver."
Mr. Fairchild. former Secretary of the Treasury,
indorsing Mr. Hewitt's statement, says: "Mr. Brynn
ought not to be voted for, whether he adheres to or
subordinates silver at 16 to i." Bourke Cockran an
nounces that he will stand this year where he did in
1896, opposed to Bryan.
It will be seen that all the objections to Bryan in
1S96 are still in issue, and that the financial question
is only one of them, the main one to be sure, but
there are others. The Gold Democrats lay much
stress upon the fact that the gold standard law will
be swept away by any groundswell that would sweep
Bryan into the White House. Very important sup
plementary legislation is required in carrying out the
Indianapolis platform, and of course there is not
only no hope of securing it from the Bryan party,
but there is the disquieting fact that what has been
done will be undone, and the country will be adrift
again upon the stormy financial sea in which so many
wrecks went down when the free silver gale was
abroad.
It has not escaped notice that the Democratic party
made a gigantic effort to purge itself of all the her
esies which Bryan fastened upon it. It felt the hope
le^ness of its fight, on the lines of 1896, and labored
to shift upon others. But Bryan rode it like the OKI
Man of the Sea. and it had to respond to his spur.
Those who made this cleansing and purgative effort
see now, very clearly, that if he is elected the party
must continue to deck itself in weeds for garlands,
and go in the wild course into which he has directed
it. Those who see this are not willing to make their
burdens permanent, and are not ambitious to help a
party that strikes like a madman at everything that
is, s-.vinging the torch of arson to destroy, with never
a suggestion of any plan for building up.
No party administration was ever perfect. If it
were there would be but one party. All administra
tions are subject to criticism. But what the people
see is the general trend and direction of a party. If
these be toward doing what government may for the
prosperity of the people, -their protection by law at
home and their safety abroad, minor mistakes arc
forgotten and errors are forgiven. There is something
in every administration that needs to be condoned.
This the people are always willing to do. They are
not to be deceived when condonable acts are seized
upon by the political opposition for prominence, and
are put forward as the things characteristic of the
whole administration. What they ask is, not is there
chaff with the wheat, but is the wheat itself good.
The Gold Democrats seem determined to give their
strength to the principles of sound money and to
believe it unwise to abandon that cause at a time that
is as critical as ever before.
They are under no illusions in the matter, and are
not to be driven any more now than in 1896. They
seem to see with great clearness, that if the hard work
done shall go for naught, and the steps taken shall
be retraced, no one can tell when the lost ground
may be regained.
They do not regard the question as settled. Eleven
Senators change. Two of them are already replaced,
free silver men taking their places, in the States of
Kentucky and Louisiana. Both of the retiring Sen
ators. Lindsay and CafTery, were Gold Democrats.
The States which yet elect are Colorado, Idaho. Kan
sas Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey. South Dakota,
West Virginia and Wyoming. Should they follow ths
lead of Kentucky and Louisiana, sound money and
the gold standard will have the precarious majority
of one in the Senate after March 4, 1901, and might
be strangled in its cradle by Colonel Bryan.
It is probable, therefore, that the GolcT Democrats
will abide by the principle they sought to establish
until its foundations are so fixed that nothing can
disturb them.
P. T. Barnum, has such a colossal aggregation of po
litical hybrids, trick riders, reform clowns and equine
performers held forth in an American city. The great
show is really a combination of several smaller
shows, all combined under the big Democratic
tent that has Jefferson and . expansion at the en
trance and Bryan and anti-expansion at the exit. The
Populist party is not here, nor is it decently repre
sented by the straggling hangers-on who call them
selves Populists, and who are here to make the pre
tense of holding a convention and indorsing the can
didate selected by Democracy because they are paid
to do so. The fire and enthusiasm and consecrated
spirit of Populism have gone out, and the boodle
refuse of the party have become parasites upon the
Democratic growth. The greed for spoils has pene
tiated their vitals, and their motto is 'Get office, and
get it any way.' They are sorry samples of the reform
that will come to this country should they ever have
opportunity to put their theories into practice."
It will be seen from that specimen that in her re
tirement Mrs. Lease has nursed her eloquence and
kept it warm. Her ginger has not lost its strength;
neither in her advancing age has she taken to lollipop
or soothing syrup. Moreover, in the lashing of her
tongue there is truth. The Populists who have be
trayed the party of Mrs. Lease's love to Bryan have
done so for a chance of office. Many of them may
even have been paid for it, as she says, lender the
most favorable point of view they cut a poor figure,
and give no evidence of a single spark of what the
irate lady calls "a consecrated spirit."
There is a chance for Mrs. Lease to take the stump
for the Wharton-Donnelly ticket. It is a good ticket
for talking about and stumps are plentiful. The "po
litical hybrids, trick riders, reform clowns and equine
performers" need just such a castigation as she can
give, and since there is to be such a multitude of talk
this fall that one haranguer more or less will make no
difference, the people will be glad to have her raise
her shrill voice and "show 'em up."
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JULY 12, 1900.
An Eastern man, who wants to contribute a band of
Indians for the Native Sons' celebration, suggests
that if he. has not a sufficient number of braves we
might induce members of the Iroquois Club to join
the company. He forgets that our Iroquois are affec
tionately but familiarly known as old squaws.
The British Liberals are grinding their teeth over
the fact that they have a splendid home programme
of reform on which they know they could carry the
country if they could only get . a hearing, but the
racket of so many wars going on doesn't give them a
chance. â¢

TO ESTABLISH GRADES
IN OUTLYING DISTRICTS
It seems after all that the leaders of the national
Democracy and of the Populists have a keen sense of
the fitness of things. Each party is to have its own
Vice Presidential nominee, but the Democrat is to re
ceive the combined vote in the electoral college. The
contestants evidently realize that this vote will not be
difficult to count.
It was just as well for Senator Hanna to contra
dict the report of a plot to assassinate the President,
but if he purposes to refute all the fakes that the
yellow journals of New York put forth during the
silly season, he will have no chance for a holiday this
summer.
It may be well enough for the Gold Democrats to
nominate a ticket this year as they did in 1896 just for
the sake of keeping up the record, but when election

Straighten Out Civil Service
Tangle.
At the meeting of the Police Commis
sioners yesterday afternoon the license
of PIncus Lafkovltz, a junk dealer at 415
Pacific street, was ordered revoked. Laf
kovitz was before Judpe Fritz charged
with buying junk from minors. The Judge
fined him $10 and asked the Commissioners
to take the action they did.
Ex-Omcer J. P. Cleary and ex-Police
Sergeant Wlttram app'.ied for restoration
to the department. Both men claim that
they were dismissed in 1S94 without just
cause. The Commissioners promised to
give their cases careful consideration.
The Civil Service Commissioners are to
Join the Police Commissioners in a meet-
Ing next week, the object being to
straighten out the tangle the promotion
examinations have produced.
All matters relating to license business
were put over until the return of Chief
Sullivan.

Marysville Company "Will Sell One
for a MillionâAnother Scheme
to Light the City.
The Marysville and Nevada Power and
Water Company yesterday submitted two
propositions to Chairman Reed of the Su
pervisors' Committee on Public Utilities.
In the first the company agrees to sell
and guarantee 10.000 inches of water to be
diverted at Alabama Bar on the North
Yuba River; also the right of way for
canals, tunnels, etc., and 2000 acres stor
age reservoir at the Oregon House Valley

Judge Conlan Prepares a Petition to
Be Laid Before the Super
visors.
Owing to the Influx of Japanese and the,
number of crimes committed by them, the
need of an Interpreter in the courts has
been manifest for some time. C. H. Gef
feney has repeatedly volunteered his serv
ices in the Police Courts, but as he re
ceives no remuneration the Judges do not
care to encroach too much upon his good
nature. Yesterday Judge Conlan had sev
eral Japanese before him charged with
aiding and abetting a lottery, and as none
of them could speak or understand plain
Anglo-Saxon the cases had to be post
poned till Geffcney's services could be pro
cured.
"It is Just as necessary to have a Japan
ese interpreter." said the Judge, "as for
any other nationality. Almost every day
cases come before the courts in which
Japanese are complaining witnesses or de
fendants and the time has arrived when
an interpreter must be appointed. The
fact is we cannot get along without one."
The Judge, prepared a petition to the
Board of Supervisors to be signed by the
Judges of the Superior and Police Courts
and the Chief of Police asking that an
amount of money should be appropriated
to pay for the services of a Japanese in
terpreter and it will be presented at the
next meeting of the board.

Mrs. Mary S. N'tcol of 2679 Twenty-first
street died under rather peculiar circum
stances last Monday. Mrs. Nicol had been
in poor health for eome time and on the
night of June 24 arose from her bed to
bathe her head in warm water. The gas
ptove on which she was accustomed to
heat the water was on a shelf and could
be reached only by standing on a stool.
In some unaccountable manner Mrs. Nicol
slipped after turning on the gas and fell
to the floor.
The fall rendered her unconscious and
she remained In that state for about fif
teen minutes before being. discovered, in
haling gas enough in that time to bring
about, in conjunction with her other ill3,
serious results.
In view of the fact that quietness was
desired, she was removed to the home of
her sister, Mrs. A. W. Valentine, 3213
Twentieth street, where she was attend
ed by Dr. Sobey. She lingered for a fort
night, but finally succumbed.
Mrs. Nicol was -45 years old. A husband
and five children survive her.

The company will expend $50,000 on the
construction of the system, which it will
sell for $0<X),0(Â«). In the second offer thÂ©
companv proposes to deed the property
free from all incumbrance for $1,000,000. to
include the construction of canals, dama.
tunnels and masonry aqueducts, the water
to be delivered Into the Oregon House

An opinion by Attorney George L.
Hughes accompanies the offer, in which
he holds that he agrees with Judge Senrls
and M. Carlin of Marysville that the
company has a prior right to 10.00*) inches
of water, which is paramount to and ex
cludes any claims made by the Browns
Valley Irrigation District or the Yuba
Electric Power Company.
M. C. Taylor repeats an offer of a water
system owned by him. He advises the Is

complete an electric plant and bring to the
city 5000 horsepower, with the necessary
distributing wires, poles and conduits for

While the early English settlers un
doubtedly possessed many "chaynie dishes
of blew and white ware," they were not
put Into use except upon state occasions.
The first dishes used by our forefathers
were wooden, made by the Indians from
the maple or poplar. This service was ex
ceedingly rude â huge trenchers from
which an entire family dined, without the
aid of forks, or sociable small trenchers,
from which the children ate in pairs,
wooden noggins, clam shells for plates
and smaller shells set in split stick* as
ladles. These primitive implements w#r?
superseded bv pewter, which was in gen
eral use until after the revolution. Fre
quently those metal dishes were as care
fully omamentod with letters and armo
rial devices as were their silver cousins.
The early colonial papers often contained
quaint advertisement of communion beak
ers, save-alls. porringers and possets or
papbowls made of this commonplace ma
terial. The inventory tl77.">) of Josiah
Wedgwood, the father of English pottery,
but confirms the impression that china
came with painful slowness into general
use, for large quantities of pewter wore
thus found among the Wedgwood house
hold goods, notwithstanding the fact that
his pottery held hundreds of dozens of
white table pieces.
"Blue china, in the world of faience,
so states a vivacious authority, "occupies
much the same position -as Shakespeare
in poetry or Velasquez in painting." She
must have had in mind the early Staf
fordshire ware of that rioh dark blue
color which the Chinese called "the light
of heaven." sent to America in such quan
tities during the early part of this cen
tury. Graceful in shape, soothing in
color, varied in design, these wares, once
the delight of the colonial house mother,
are now the will-o'-the-wisp of the china
collector. Prominent among the many de
signs for which this ware is noted the
later reproductions printed in less pleas
ing colors are the decorations known as
the Beauties of America. Tomb of Frank
lin, Landing of the Pilgrims and Anti-
Slavery designs.
The blue ware most frequently un
earthed by the china hunter in search for
Staffordshire is the well-known willow
pattern, generally conceded to be the most
popular pattern evpr printed. Country
dealers, innocent of tho comparative mod
emness of this design, frequently chum
that their specimens date from the May
flower or long before the Revolutionary
War. and therefore command fabulous
prices.
Another popular blue ar.d whitP ware
was the "old l.lue canton" such as "Wash

of colonial chir.a Is interesting to Ameri

by the officers of the French army: the
Fet with the figure of Fame bearing the
Cincinnati bads?e ; presented by the Society
of the Cincinnati; the s**t presented by

and the Crown Derby sets, and the set
with Washington's cipher, surrounded by
tiny rose wreaths, besides numberless odd
pieces and punchbowls.

the punch bowl (from "pauch," an Indian
drink) figured conspicuously during the
eighteenth century at funerals, christen
ings, elections, wedding feasts, church
dedications, apple-paring bees and at the
first Continental Congress. Washington's
collection of thfse capacious pledges of
goodfellowshin was numerous and famous
for varied reasons. Not the least Interest
ing among thein Is the one of Canton

decorated with the American flag. Th.^

the scars of struggle, is Interesting be
cause it was for a long time buried in the
ground, which served as its hiding place
from Tarleton's men.
Before the revolutionary war no pottery
or porcelain was manufactured exclusive
ly for the American market. After that
time much of the Cincinnati pattern was
sent to this country and from the Staf
fordshire and Liverpool potteries came
the Eminent American series. In which
Washington and Franklin figured most
prominently on pitchers; and. curiously
enough, miieh ware decorated with de
signs representing battle scenes in which
the English were defeated. Upon many
pitchers were pictures commemorative of
incidents in the life of Washingtonâ
"Scenes at Mount Vernon." "Washington
and Martha Prinking Tea." "The Apothe
osis of Washington." etc. One design pop
ular among English potters shows under a
medallion of "The Glorious American" the
words "Long live the President of the
United States," above, the legend. "My
favorite son," and still above that this
awful warning. "Deafness to the ear that
will patiently hear and dumbness to the
tongue that will utter a calumny against

Preliminary Announcements Show
That the Season Will Be a
Brilliant One.
The preliminary announcement of tho
forthcoming season of grand opera at tho
Tivoli Opera-house promise? more in the
quantity and quality of entertainment
than has ever yet been offered in tho
operatic line in San Francisco. There has
been Melba at $7 a seat, with an indiffer
ently good supporting company; tho
French opera company for a short season.
with a few good operas, at $3 and $o a
seat: Italian opera companies galore, with.
their good soloists, wretched choruses
and miserable staging at fair enough, â¢
prices; also for a yeÂ«r the respectably
good stock opera, company known as
Southwell's, at popular pricea; but tho
Tivoli we have always with us.
ThfÂ» Tivoli Opera-house haa probably
done more for the cause of good music
In San Francisco than any other dozen
agencies combined. For twenty-one
years, rain or shine. In good times or evil,
the good work of thi* house has gone on.
All the standard operas have beÂ»-n given
again and again. Many of the rarer
works have also been heard from time to
time, and a surprising proportion of ac
tual novelties have made their "first ap
pearance" on the Tivoli boards. The soio
ists have been always the best "that the
resources at hand permitted." The chorus
is famously good and the orchestra ar
tistically e<jual to any other in America.
The staging, also, is thoroughly satis
factory. \Vith all these advantages, and
at a price within everybody's reach, it 13
little wonder that the musical tone of San
Francisco ia something of a surprise to
the visiting artists. And let the good
work go on.
The last season of grand opera will bo
well remembered by all musicians. Eigh
teen weeks it lasted, and saw the magni
tic^nt success of Gaudenzio Salassa. the
triumphs of Avetiano ami many other
musical events, but this season should
outvie the last by double measure for
measure, according to the list of artlsta
already secured.
Salassa. the gre.at actor and singer, will
come again. Avedano. the fine tenor, will
also be here, both of these coming directly
from Italy. Anna Lichter. our sweet
soprano, and 'William Schuster are among
the welcomed names from last year's list.
As to the new names, they are no less
notable. Direct from La Scala, Alllan.
comes the famous basso profundo. Ales
sandrn Nieolinl. announced as "Europe's
greatest bass." Also from Alilan will
come the distinguished tenor Domenico
Rosso, one of the finest lyric tenors on
the stago. Another Italian to come will
be Signorina Italia Vittoria Repetto. the
lyric soprano, whose good worn is well
known. Sljrnorina Pollettinl, lats cf the
I-ambardl company, will be welcome in
the contralto roles, and Frances Stuart
Graham, now at the Tivoli. will also be
heard with pleasure. <juinto Zani. bary
tor.e, ends the list so far. but it is hinted
that another shining lisrht is yet to come.
Among the novelties to be produced dur
ing the season will be the famous "La
Boheme": Verdi's "Falstaff." with Slgrnor
Salasaa in the title role, and the "Haralet"
of Ambroise Thomas, with Salassa a.3 the
great Dane. Kalstaff fcÂ» one of Salassa' 1 *
greatest roles. The repertoire will also
include "Alda." "Faust. ' "Lucia." "II
Trovatore." "Im Olocnnda." "I Papllac
ci." "Cavalleria Ru*ticana." "Lohengrin."
"The Jewess." "Klgoletto," "Ernaii."*
"Carmen." "The Masked Ball." "The
Bnrber of Seville." "I>a SonnambuUi."
"Romeo and Juliet," "Mignon," "La Tra
viata*' and other popular operas.

$798,3.10 put in circulation during the four
days' celebration. From the calculations
that have been made, based on past ex
perience and on prospective increase in
attendance, the amount that will go into
the various lines of trade will vastly ex
ceed the gross amount of ten years ago.

of the hÂ«Â»rh w*re placed In a dish, buttered!

a seventeenth century pessimist deplored
the custom as a "ba'e and unworthy In
dian practice."
The Wedgworxi teapot then, as now. was
the most perfect on the market. Shrewd
business man a9 well as philanthropist,
this prince of potters had gTa.v<Â» yet need
less fears of American competition in thÂ»
ftrtile art. At one timÂ« he feared to losa
entirely his Immense colonial trade owing
to thp discovery of fin*Â» American clay and
its attempt at manufacture by h!s rene
gade foreman. It la strange that so much,
of this master's exquisite ware la still to
be found In our country. In spitft of !tÂ»
fragility it has stood the perils of ocean
transportation, has been washed asanre
in crates and boxes from wreckPd vessels,
has been buried in the" sands and hidden
behind panels in the wainscoting of coloÂ«
nlal houses, and after many historical
vicissitudes still withstands the wear and
tear of more than a century.
"Although the greater number of the
innumerable secret societies which liter
ally honeycomb China have no connection
with public affairs still the latent hostil
ity with which the Chinese regard the
barbarians of the west will provide the
various bodies with Â«uch a community
of purpose that any foreign Invader will
find the imperial array by no means the
greatest of the dangers to be encoun
tered," said J. Down.'V Harvey, a recent
arrival from China in the Palace yester
day.
"Once let the word po round China that
the integrity of the land is threatened."
continued Mr. Harvey, "and the pass
words and mottoes of those secret secte
ties. which have for their object the ex
pulsion of the Tartar*, will be altered to
the expulsion of the foreigners. The mo
ment this is done all the other bodies will
join in the movement.
"Confronted with minions of desperate
foes who obey the decrees of these secret
bodies with a fidelity they never dream
of extending to the central authority of
Peking, Germany. Russia. Kngland ana
America will speedily tind that scram
bling for China is an enterprise fraught
with the gravest peril.
"Although there is a certain secretive
tendency in the Chinese character which
prompts them to join societies with secret
aims, objects and desires, John Chinaman,
speaking generally, becomes a conspira
tor becausp he finds in secret combination
a weapon which enables him to tight the
despotism of the authorities. When the
various bodies have mastered the ulterior
objects of the foreigners the Tien-Ti-
Hivey, or Hung League, the most power
ful of all the secret societies and the one
which stirred up the terrible rebellion of
Taeping In 1S49, will Issue instructions for
a conference composed of delegates from
all other societies.
Â¦Will All Unite.
"The supremacy of Tien-Ti-Hivey,
which means the Association of Heaven
and Earth, is so universally conceded that
in presence of a danger common to all the
delegates who attend will come prepared
to place their organization at the disposal
of the parent body, their renunciation of
Independence going so far that the entire
membership, exceeding 100,000.000 in num
ber, will join the Tien-Ti and call them
selves Heaven Earthmen. The society it
self will then be known as the Triad.
"Considering that the moral code of the
Tien-Ti is extremely pure, that It incul
cates the equality of all men. the duty
of benevolence and forgivenness of all
injuries, the task of expelling invaders
would seem hardly compatible with aims
so lofty: but as the moral code. beside3
sanctioning any means of securing con
verts also prescribes punishment for those
who oppose its edicts, forgiveness of all
injuries Is certain not to be practiced till
the foreigners have taken their departure.
"Still, to disarm opposition the Tien-
Ti will take care to secure the support
of Xeang Ma Hung, the Queen of Heav
en's Company, or Her Ladyship's Society,
meaning 'the queen of heaven, the moth
er and nurse of all things." an associa
tion which fixes the standard of pure liv
ing. With .the exception of th^se two so
cieties the. objects of the others range
from mutual assistance and the overthrow
of all despotic government, to theft, rob
bery and murder. The apathy and sullen
resistance which renders the Chinese
rulers so powerless at The present time
will vanish when these go on the warpath.
Some millions of patriots, all sworn to
protect each other against the attacks
of police officers, to hide each other's
crimes, to assist detected members in
making their escape from the hands of
justice, may not be animated by high mo
tives, but the t>ond. such as it is. is well
calculated to rouse their combative in
stincts.
Meet in the Forests.
"The Tton-Ti have meeting places hid
den In forests and mountains scattered all
over China. Despite the efforts of the
Chinese police, the secret of their where
abouts has been maintained for 300 years.
"So far as I know, no European has ever
been present at any of the lodge's meet
ings. The places are most difficult of ac
cess, every approach being defended by
traps and pitfalls under charge of armed*
men. posted in the trees or hidden in the
brushwood. A Chinaman resident in Lkiii
don, and with whom I had many transac
tions in Shanghai, tells me thatthe ritual
of the meeting which will no doubt be
held by the time these lines are in print
is p.ttremply curious.
"The delegates chosen to attend, on ar
rival at the appointed spot, will enter by
the first gate, or 'aug,' ns it is called. An
executioner is stationed here for the pur
pose of beheading intruders. Proceeding
in an easterly direction the visitor* will
come to a temporary structure called the
'Red Flowery Pavilion.' where water is
provided to cleanse the soul and purify
the thouehts. After passinsr through the

Happiness.' The head of the Kolao-Kwal
havlnjr knocked without answer being re
turned, his place will be taken by the del
egate of the White Lily Society, one of
the most criminal of all the secret soci
eties, who repeats the demand for entry.
Upon this a sword, which, strangely
onoueh. is the traditional weapon of the
'Brethren of the Triad." as it is of the
Freemasons, is thrust from a partially
openod window into the hands of a Ylk-ko
or 'Chief Ruling Brother." This function
ary will bear the weapon aloft to the
'Temple of Destruction in the City of the
Willows.' Collecting round a font, each
will then till a vessel with wine, into
which all drop a little of their own blood
and then drink to the dregs, swearing
eternal brotherhood and deathless hate to
the Russians and Germans.

organizations of China. If white hairs
should be observed growinsr out of the
groundâ an infallible sign of impending
misfortuneâ these San-ko men are certain
to be heard of. The Tlen-Tl will put no
trained army In the field, but will trust to
the efforts of the San-ko by day. and the
Shee Hoks by night. These latter, a
ferocious band, will hover on the outskirts
of* the Invading army, killing- all strag

White Ixitus will send its emissaries to

records reek of assassination. Money, too,
for the work would not be wanting. The

Tim McGrath. the well known trainer

days looking for a match between Jim
Tremble, his latest protege, and pome
pood middle-weight in the neighborhood
of JH pound?. McGraih is particularly
anxious for a match between his man and

Those who have seen Tremble perform

MARCEAU IN CUSTODY
BUT A SHORT TIME
Judge McAdam of New York Seems
Disposed to Dismiss the Kid
naping Charge.
Special Dlsriatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. July 11.â Colonel Theodore
Marceau of San Francisco, charged with
having kidnaped his child from his di
vorced wife, was detained in custody but
a short time to-day. When the facts were
submitted to Judge McAdam he was in
clined to discharge the colonel at once, but
placed him in the custody of his counsel
until to-morrow in order that an exam
ination could be made of the legal points
involved.
"This man Is held on the ridiculous
charge of kidnaping his own child," de
clared Marceau's attorney to-day. "He
has the custody of the child under an
order of court, and; notwithstanding that
fact, this woman goes to Ogdensburg and
obtains a warrant for his arrest for kid
naping."
"Is he the father of this child?" Inquired
Judge McAdam.
"He certainly Is," replied Mr. Howe.
"How can a man kidnap his own child?"
asked the Judge.
"I don't know," was the answer of As
eistant District Attorney Hennessey.
Mr. Howe protested that on the facts
there was nothing else to be done but to
discharge his client. Judge McAdam will
give his decision to-morrow.

CONCESSION TO AMERICANS.
Sundays at Paris.
Our Athletes Need Not Compete, on
PARTS, July II.â What appeared to be a
disagreeable obstacle In the way of the
American athletes participating in the in
ternational sports which began on Satur
day, has been amicably and satisfactorily
settled. To-nlffht a meeting; wa3 held
in the rooms of the racing club and the
question of Sunday games, which it was
thought had been arranged, again ap
peared, and some of the most Important
events for the Americans were llxed lor
that day. When the original plans of the
meeting were outlined, the sports were
scheduled to begin on Sunday, which is
the day of all sporting events In France.
The agitation In the United States became
such and the refusal of the teams to enter
was so genera] that Mr. Spalding and his
assistant, Mr. De Garmendia. made strong
representations to the French officials in
charge of the sports, who finally agreed
that as Saturday Is a national holiday in
France the sports should be begun on that
day. 'v.--:-

Floodgate won first money In the Mid
week reserve stake at Union Park yes
terday with Crawford Braes as runner-up.
Floodgate's courses were decisive victories
and were won with good wide margins.
The courses throughout the stake were
generally lone tests and relief dogs were
turned loose on five occasions before the
kills were made. Short ends landed often
enough to make things Interesting from
the bettor's point of view. The first up
set came In the fourth course. Lady GU
more was on U;e card to run with Master
Lawrence, but the latter dog was with
drawn and Sea Breez*. a recent importa
tion of the Russei; Allen & Wilson kennel,
was substituted for the bye course.
Sea. Breeze had just been boaten point
less by H. W. Hike's Nancy R in the first
run of the day and the talent in conse
quence thought but little of her chances
against a fresh dog. She beat the Lady
out. however, in a good run at odds of 6
to 1. Floodgate in tho second course fol
lowing got the flag- from Battleship, who
was quoted a 7 to 1 favorite. Olympus
beat Hummer at odds of 5 to 3; Miss Griz
zle beat Shylock Boy at the same odds;
Pepita beat O K Capitol at 3 to 1 in a
long course; Royal Oak beat Twilight Jr.
pointless. 2 to 1; Kustan beat Blackhawk
5 to 3; Floodgate beat Auckland 5 to 3;
Sky Blue beat Motto 2 to 1; Hawker beat
Scottish Chief 5 to 3; Slim beat Wild
Norah 4 to 1. These with a few others at
slight odds constltupted the short ends.
P. McCabe's Sky Blue was withdrawn
from the stake in the fourth round by the
field stewards. The dog's trainer was
seen to give the hound a stimulant while
on the field. He was called to account for
his action and was asked for the liquid.
He refused to accommodate the stewards
and poured the preparation on the ground.
His action will be investigated by the
proper committee.

CHICAGO, July 11.â Bookmakers at
Washington Park track have lost thou-
Far.ds oi dollars through a swindling
scheme that came to light to-day. The
t-hiel factor in the scheme is under arrest
anil h;ts named two men as his confener*
atts.
All of the pool tickets used at the track
are made iÂ»y a downtown firm in this city,
and to-day 'Herman Appel. one of its em
ployes, v.'a^ placed uikJit arrest on the
clfarK'c of stealing tickets and using them
to defraud bookmakers at the track. After
Ix-ing locket! up for an hour he confessed
and n;tni<-d C. R. llusrell anc K. Levitt,
botli well known at the track, as Ills ac
complices.
The j.ian was to watch for the issuing
of tickets and tlu-n making out a dupli
cate rush to the bookmaker as soon as tho
race was finished ar.d cash in before the
holder of the actual ticket could get
around.
It is impossible to form an estimate of
how larpe the operations have been, but
one bookmaking tirm. known as the
Trisco Club, has been the heaviest loser,
and It is said that it Is out thousands of
dollars. Several other bookmakers have
beon hit hard.

ST. LOUIS, July 11.â A statement of the
position of the local street railway strik
ers, reviewing the strike since its incep
tion, was given to the public this after
noon. In the closing paragraph the state
ment declares that, in the opinion of the
union, a fair settlement of the strike can
not be obtained -while Mr. Baumhoff re
mains in the position of general manaRer.
A member of the executive committee
of the local union of street railway em
ployes said that the day had been spent In
investigating tho statements made by Mr.
Baumhoff regarding the names of men
that he has reported had gone to work
for the Transit Company. It was declared
that not a sinple man had deserted the
union and but one man of all the names
posted by A3,r. Baumhoff had gone to work
and this man had quit work as soon as
the strike was redeclared.
Cars are running on all of the lines
about as usual, but it Is noticeable that
the number of wagons and other vehicles
carrying passengers has increased during
the past two days.
President Whitaker had this to say to
day:
"1 know nothing of any statement hav
ing been made that the company would
not proceed to live up to the agreement
by which .the strike was settled. We have
reinstated several men who submitted
their applications after the settlement.
The company will continue to pursue the
policy which it has always followed. It
stands ready to take back any former em
plcrye who asks for a position and who is
known to be a good man."
Adam II. Fuchs. one of the leading mil
liners here, to-day executed a chattel deed
of trust for the benent of creditors. The
liabilities of the concern amount to about
$48,000 but the assets have not yet been
inventoried. Mr. Fuchs said:
"The strike was the sole cause of the
filing of the deed of trust. The stopping
of the street railway traffic so Kieatly
diminished our trade that we felt it neces
sary to protect our creditors."

VIOLA FOSTER, a colored woman
weighing about 400 pounds, was
congratulated by Judge Conlan yes
terday on her detective ability, and
the Judge suggested that she should apply
for a position In the, '.'upper office.'.' 'She
took the suggestion â¢ seriously and the
Judge may be called upon to use his In
fluence In getting her appointed one of
Captain Seymour's sleuths.
Viola was the complaining witness In
the case of the People vs. Nellie Ray
mond, a Caucasian, charged with, petty
larceny. Nellie was accused of stealing
a. pair of gold eyeglasses valued at: ?12.
the property of Amy Sllvey, a colored
girl living at 431 Jessie street', where Viola
also resfdes. Nellie made a call upon Amy
on the -morning-of July 6, and after she
had left the eyeglasses were missed. Amy
mentioned the fact to Viola, who deter
mined to play detective. She waited upon
Nellie that afternoon and asked her in a
friendly way. .where -she ..was in the habit
of .buying her eyeglasses. Nellie being
troubled with sore eyes. Nellie. told her,
and .Viola 'went to an optician On" Keamy
street and asked him 'what sort of glasse-s
Nellie had purchased. :The optician said
she had exchanged a- pair of gold eye
glasses for the â¢ ones she . got. Viola re
quested to bo shown the gold eyeglasses,
and sure enough they were the ones stolen
from Â» iflj "LiWi''>M^[li^^(#]ff(y0uili6iWriti.'gMii
Armed with this Information Viola
called upon Nellie and charged her with
the theft and also with stealing her gold
bracelet. Nellie broke down and con
fessed her fall from grace, and Viola took
her to the City. Prison, where a charge of
petty larceny i was booked against her.
.-Viola told her story in court yesterday
so. ingenuously. that the Judge could not
refrain . from extending - his congratula
tions. Amy was called upon and identified
the eyeglasses. Nellie declined. to make a
statement, and â¢ the Judge convicted her
and ordered her to appear â¢ for sentence
this morning.
"I shall bring your case to theattention

OBSTRUCTIONS ON THIRD
STREET TO BE REMOVED

mission to Maintain Buildings
on the Driveway. Â»
The Board of Public Works has recom
mended to the Board of Supervisor* that
the obstructions on Third street, between
Berry Â«and Channel, be ordered re
moved, and that sixty days time be given
therefor. Two weeks ago a petition
Â«=igned by property-owners representing
4&43 feet of frontage on Third street, from
MarKct to Channel, was filed with the
Supervisors. In which it was alleged that
certain persons had unlawfully entered
upon and taken possession of the inner
half of the driveway on Third street,
from Berry to Channel, and have erected
thereon numerous wooden house?, sheds
and structures to the number of ten or
more, thereby depriving the public of ac
cess to the water front at the end of
Third street. Â¦
A J. Donovan, principal office assistant
of the Bureau of Street?, made an inves
tigation and reports that he is unable to
find any resolution of the Board of Super
visors granting permission to the South
End Rowing Clob to maintain the build

VACATION WAS SPOILED
BY SUCCESSIVE MISHAPS
Two Warm - Belt Peace Guardians
Abandon an Abalone Fishing
Excursion.
Police Officers Joseph A. Crakbon and
John. Potter of the Mission division figured
on having a gay time during their twelve
days" vacation in catching abalone "fish"'
! v.ith a hook and line at Halfmoon Bay.
j That economy might be a feature of their
; outing they provided amply for this in
their own peculiar way. They hired a
horse and wagon to carry all of their
pro\'ision and camping" outfit. Potter, who
claims to be a judge of horseflesh, as- '
signed himself to this branch of the con
tract, while Crakbon. who knows, or
thinks he does, ail about short-jointed
sausages, undertook to purchase the!
stores and reguiate the packing..
Everything wont well after the start
had been made a few days ago until
Golden City oji the San Bruno road was
reached, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon.
Here the "skate" that Potter had picked
out for the trip and which had been se
cured from the stables of the Shea fam
ily, known as peddlers throughout the
Mission, braced its forefeet in the dusty
roadway and refused to budge an inch
either backward or forward.
The peddWs "hoss" was coaxed and
cajoled to move. ' Crakbon tried to pull
him along by the bridle, while Potter be
labored him with a San Hruno wattle cut
from an accommodating hedge on the
wayside, but all in vain. , .
Finally the stubborn brute' was un
hitched and turned loos?, while Crakbon
; returned to town for another nag. The
n^w horse was hitched to the wagon and
a start was made. About 4 o'clock in thÂ»;
morning horse, cart and contents wer-i
found in a ditch on the roadside near the
county line, where the rig had overturned
while the two men were asleep in the
vehicle. Word wa? brought to the Seven
teenth-street station and the mounts 1
squad was sent out to the rescue. After
enjoining secrecy ffom all parties the two
officers abandonr-d the trip and are now
home in prolusion, afraid to show their
faces to th^ir grinning companions.
A Defaulting Agent.
T. E. Scully, wholesale liquor merchant

and the steamers and schooners are over
crowded with passengers and freight.
"The capitalists of Eureka are now pull
ing together and have determined to make
it a manufacturing center and they have
earned the gratitude of the entire county.
They realize that through manufactories
a county or State grows rapidly prosper
ous. A large woolen mill, which will be
equipped with the most modern machin
ery at a cost of about $150,000. is in course
of construction. 4Jarge pulp and paper
factory and a boot and shoe factory will
be built in the near future. v
"The redwood manufacturers are em
ploying every known method to extend
their business in the Far East, and will
probably send representatives to Japan
and the" Philippines and the Open ports
of China. The great drawback to Eureka,
and Humboidt County is the matter of
egress and ingress. Just think of being
out in the ocean forty-eight hours to
travel a distance of 250 miles. It consumes
almost a week to come here and return.
A place of 35.000 people ought to have oeV
ter transportation facilities. A railroad

Ray Oregon, down the coast to tap the
immense timber belts of Northern Cali

with or buy out the Donahue line and
have its terminus in this city. At the

endeavoring to secure the franchise from
the city for a terminus.

A VERY pretty wedding was cele

at the altar. The nuptial knot was tied
by the Rev. Father Otis. The bride was

MR. AND MRS. ARTHUR J. BRANNAGAN.
From telegraphic dispatches received
late last night it Is learned that Arch
bishop Rlordan^expected to leave Chicago
yesterday. He will consequently, if he
carries out this intention, reach this city
next Saturday. His Grace arrived In Chi
cago several days ago and has been ex
tensively entertained by the church dig
nitaries of that city. He returns after
an eight months' absence from America
during which he made his decennial re
port to the Propaganda at RorriB-of the
affairs in his archdiocese.
The Archbishop's private secretary, Rev.
Father Patrick Mulligan, arrived last
night from the East and went directly to
the home of his mother. He reports that
the Archbishop is in the best of health
and that he has been materially benefited
by his trip and his well-earned rest.
Archbishop Riordan left San Francisco
in October. 1S9D, with his secretary. They
were joined in Chicago by Father Daniel
J. Riordan. ,the Archblshcp's brother, of
St. Elizabeth's Church. All three sailed
from New York on the Hamburg-Ameri
can liner Augusta Victoria on November
4. Â«ln their absence they visited Italy,
France. Belgium. England and Ireland,
but have spent more time In Rome than
at any other place. Archbishop Riordan
had an audience with the Pope, who
evinced a deep interest when he was in
formed of the growth and progress made
in the San Francisco diocese. While in
Rome the visitors witnessed the ceremony
of the anniversary of the coronation of
the Pope, which was an impressive and
elaborate affair.
Rev. Father McQuaid journeyed over
land from Chicago, with Father Mulligan.
He went to the Philippines about ! two
years ago. heinp sent there by the Arch
bishop. He was stationed for a time at
Negros Inland. *vith a battalion of the
First California Volunteers. He also per
formed hospital service in the Philippines.
Father McQuaid had a bad malarial at
tack and was told by physicians that he
must so away or that he would die. He
then went to Europe and has since visited
in Ireland. He was in New York when the
Archbishop artived there. When Father
Mulligan was r^ariy to return to San
Francisco. Farther McQuaid decided to ac
company him. Father McQuatd's health
has much improved since he left the Phil
ippines, but he is still troubled with an
occasional reminder of his sickness
abroad.
His Private Secretary, Father Mulli
gan, Has Returned, and Reports
His Superior in Best of
Health.
His Grace Left Chicago for
Home on Last Night's
Overland.

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, July 11.â The bull manlpula- |
tlon In Union Pacific turned the market from
a reactionary course to-day and made the tone
during the latter part of the session of the
Stock Exchange'ctrong throughout. The later
strength was not sufficient In all cases to en
tirely wipe out the earlier losses, but they
vrers in all cases much reduced. There were
tin>es during the day when Union Pacific was
practically the only stock which Mood firm
against the tide of reaction. The support of
the stock was very determined and the absorp
tion very confident and on an enormous scale.
There was no special news to explain the
niovmenl aside from the general conditions In
its territory and its finances. No suggestion I
ha* been offered that the dividend raters like- '
ly to be increased over that at one-half per cent I
decline for the last cemi-annual iÂ»eriod. The
Government crop report was an important in
fluence in the stock market all day. An effort
was made to ignore Its significance In the
early dealings on the ground that the weather !
burpau's weekly summary, reporting abundant |
ralr.s in the West, must be accepted as modi
fying the conclusions of the Government
monthly report, as it covered a period a week
later than the latter. But when trading be
gan on the Produce Exchange the jump In
Wheat there nullified this argument. St. Paul's
heavy decrease In earnings for the first week
in July added to the weakness in the granger
group and there were sharp declines in all
the principal members of the group. The
corn cirrying roads were relatively firm and
the bears who have sold short In the South
westernÂ» on the cotton crop prospects were
driven to cover. With this exception and pome
strength in the local traction group and In
Sugar and Tobacco, the market became gen
erally heavy, but the persistent strength of
Union Pacific finally encouraged a growing bull
following, which manifested itself first in Rock
Island and then developed In Southern Pacific
and then In Missouri pacific. In spite of the
continued strength In the Wheat market and
the gharp advance in the price of corn, the
market continued pretty steadily upward from
that time until profit taking by room traders
In the closing dealings caused the Irregular
tone with which the market closed. The ex
treme advance in Union Pacific was 3%c. Rock
Island Is up 1% and Missouri Pacific and
Southern Pacific a large fraction. Otherwise
the net changes In the leading railroads are
small. Ft. Paul lost a point net. The decision
of International houses not to ship gold on
to-morrow's eteamer had some favorable ef
fect.
The - market for bonds continues very dull

Fruit Contracts in England.
T/or.dca Grocers' CJczett*. June 23, Eays:
"There la nothing fres-h to report regarding
<5ealir.Â»rs In Oallfcmi.i fruits. An imixirtant
mÂ«vt)nfr. under the auKpices of the Preserved
Tood F.wiSon of the Iymdon Chamber of Com
mprop, was hfM en Tuesday !a?t to consider a
circular lssuod by the CaHforr.ia Fruit Pack
ers' Association. There was .a. good attendance
of Lundon and I^iverj^ool canned goods deal
ers. Packers had l>e*-n requf-uied to make al
lowance in full for blown and leaking tins.
This rerjueFt was granted, but at the same
time certain terms cf contract were sought
to t>e imj*o***<i which were <lo*?m^<I unsatisfac
tory. The f<nra of contract issued by . the
packers was considered grossly unfair to the
brills!) trade, the principal objection, it Is
Hated, being raised to the condition which
*et forth that "No allowance exeej.t for blown
ejrti leaking tine. l>ut for these full invoice
prices will be allowed, and the quantity net
tled on the result of an examination at th~
destination, befcre delivery, of not less than
10 lÂ»er cent of the entire, parcel for average,
each ehipment or tender to be settled sepa
rately. In case the amount of claim arising
tram blown and leaking tins exceeds 1 per
cent cf the Invoice value, sellers ehall be noti
fied immediately by cable.' A eub-eommittee
vru appointed to deal with the matter and has
tince ir!-ue<i an amended form of contract for
rubmtsKlon to the Canners' Association, the
l>rir.cinal demand being allowances for badly
rvirted and collapsed tins, in addition {'to the
allowance offered hr the packers, while an
alteration In the terms Is alaso required. From
firtt hands lius-lnefF in Salmon If limited, but
the market remains firm. For the l&Ou pack
trfir.E?.rtl(Â»ns are also not numerous, but the
inactivity at this department is mainly due to
the ur.willingn^sB of r.ackers to sell."
Railroads, li' heat and Cotton.
The TCpw York circular of nenry Clsws says:
"The railroad situation is excellent. The vari
ous systems continue to report large earnings,
exceeding even the extraordinary gains of the
lart two- yearn. It is well to remember, however,
that operating expenses have also Increased
very rapidly, often in greater proportion than
(Toss earning?; hence lt would be folly to an
ticipate any further Increase In dividends.
Railroad managers are fully conscious of this
eltuation. and their conservatism In refusing
to increase dividends during a period of alto
gether exceptional prosperity will no â¢â¢ doubt
prove their wisdom later oa. At the moment
tl>Â«rt is a stroftg bullish sc-uttaoat in the
"street." which seems amply Justified by home
conditions. Prices of the leading speculative
railroad issues had declined fully 10 to 12
points below the best figures of 19<X> and 1S99;
and the leading industrials have scored still
larger decline.", many now celling considerably
below the Issue point. With good preferred 4
per cent railroad shares rell'.ng under 75, and
many of the best preferred Industrials selling
on an J.G9 per cent basis, while time money
Is plentiful at 3^4 p*r cent, it Is not likely
that such an opportunity for a bull movement
will be readily overlooked. It Is evident that
very little stimulus Is necessary for the In
auguration of a fresh bull campaign. The
chief drawbacks are the Chinese situation and
the approach of the elections. Of the two the
former is the more serious. Confidence Is the
watchword for the future, but lt should be
mixed with a liberal allowance of caution.
"The adoption at the Kansas City convention
of the 16 to 1 silver plank, indicating the rati
fication of the entire Chicago platform. Is
Flmrly inflicting bari-karl ui>on their Presi
dential nominee. The people of this country
are not going to vote from a feeling of desper
ation, as they did when they voted for that
platform at the last Presidential election.
Wheat was then f.4 cents a bushelâ now .It Is
M cents. Cotton was then 6's> cents a pound
now lt Is 10 cents. These prices have made
the people of the West and South prosperous
and contented, therefore their frame of mind
is vastly different than : when foreclosure of
their property stared them in the face. Now
that these people have had a taste of pros
perity they want it continued, and that means
that they want no violent change in govern
mental policy."

EASTERN MARKETS.
CHICAGO, July 11.â Wheat started strong.
September 1%<31%c higher at 81%@82c. The
Government crop report for July, which re
duced th'e Wheat prospect about a hundred
million bushels from, that of June, furnished
ammunition for the bulls. There was liberal
selling on the bulge, however, on the .belief
that the crop In the Northwest had been great
ly benefited by recent rains. Bearish harvest
nows from Russia also hampered the advance
somewhat and September slipped off to 81V4J?
81%c. â¢ The early sellers were soon boiled out
and offerings became scarce. Then shorts rush
ed to cover and there was considerable buy-
Ing for the long account. Under this move
ment September rcse steadily to 83c. There
were several soft spots on profit taking, but
the market ruled strong throughout aud Sep
tember closed at E2?iÂ©S2%c.
Corn showed decided strength, being helped
by the advance in Wheat and claims of dam
age by drought. September closed with a
gain of l%c.
Oats rallied with the other cereals and closed
strong, September lc over yesterday.
Lower prices at the yards and unexpected
heavy receipts of Hogs depressed Provisions
early. The market rallied later when the grain
list turned so strong. Packers bought heav
ily. September Pork closed 12%c higher. Lard

affected some of the growers, notably In Utah.
Wyoming and Idaho, who are offering - wools
at decidedly lower figures. Notwithstanding
the low prices asked for wool* manufacturers
do not appear to be In a mood to purchase, as
they are uncertain as to the kinds of wool
which will be needed their lightweight
goods, the extent of the demand and the
basis upon which prices will settle. When the
lightweight eÂ»as3n has ' definitely developed a
better demand for wool is 'anticipated.

Dried Fruits, Nuts and Raisins.
From the California Cured Fruit Association
it Is learned that "Prunes are dropping quite
heavily !n the Santa Clara Valley, that is. in
sections, which, it is thought, will reduce the
output to a considerable extent, say 10 per
rent. The crop estimate Is not now as high as
It was thirty days ago. ! The Prunes will run
to small sizes on an average, the warm weathÂ»r
having checked the growth, and they are begin
ning to color up. The harvest will be at least
ten days earlier than usual."

MAYWARDS, July 11.â An attach
ment formed in childhood, rlpen-
II II ing into friendship and then love
,** . Is . the ' story which culminated in
the secret marriage last December of Miss
Maude Williams and Alfred E. Keating
of Haywards, There was an objection to
the engagement on the part of the young
woman's mother. Despite the maternal
direction to break with her sweetheart
Miss Williams was ready when the sug
gestion of elopement was made and one
day last December the young couple sped
away [ to - San Rafael, . where they were
married' by -Rev. Father Sullivan.
The secret was so well buried by the
young folks that until last night neither
family had the slightest , intimation of
the affair. Then Mrs. Keating broke the
news to her mother, who is Airs. T. N.
Martin. The young wife had been resid
ing for some time with a sister In San.
Francisco and there her husband paid her
frequent visits, eluding the watchful
mamma, who, it Is said, was so - strongly
opposed to her daughter's marriage.
But now that the story is out every one
concerned is content and parental bless
ings, have been very properly bestowed
upon the devoted pair.
Both families have resided at Hay
wards for ; many years, being among the
oldest and most prominent people in Eden
Township, j Young Keating has for three
years been a student In the medical de
partment of the University of California,
. Mrs. Keating is 19 years old and is a
sister of Mrs. Dr. J. M. Forrest of San
Francisco.
OAKLAND, July 11.â Smallpox exists in

residing at S30 East Fourteenth street. Is
also aflllcted. She has been isolated in a
tent near her home, where the Enos child
will also be cared for until the residences
have been fumigated. Several other case3
have been traced to the Enos home, the
patient having passed through the serious
stage of the disease before It was diag
nosed. The health authorities had their
attention called to-day to the case. Dr.
Kitchings, president of the Board of
Health, says there is no epidemic and no
danger of one, the disease being purely
local in extent. Several employes of the
Pacific Press, who It was feared had
come In contact with a case at Haywards,
have been quarantined for a few days.

to earn his winter schooling.
When but 13 years old he began life, by
clerking in a country store. At IS years
of age he had got on so well that he was
able to start a store of his own at Kewa
nee. III., carrying It on till 1S61. when he
came to California and engaged in mining
in Placer County. He then after many
stirring adventures, enlisted in the service
of Wells. Fargo & Co. at Gold Hill, Nev.
While in Nevada he was on the staff of
Provost Marshal General Jacob Van Bok
kelen, serving as an aid. After leaving
the express company. Mr. Hale became a
member of the San Francisco Stock Ex
change, continuing In that business until
1SS4.
In that year he was elected â eriff of
Alameda County on the Republican ticket.
To this office he was twice re-elected. In
1S91 he was appointed by the State Board
of Prison Directors Warden of San Quen
tln Penitentiary. He served two terms
making way for Agulrre of Los Angeles.
Mr. Hale was married in Nevada in 1867
to Miss S. M. McElroy, daughter of a
minister. One daughter. Miss Sadie Hale,
is the fruit of the union.
WILLIAM E. HALE. ex-Sheriff of
Alameda County and ex-Warden
of the State prison at San Quea
tln, died rather suddenly at his
home. US Twelfth street. Oakland, shortly
before midnight last night. Heart disease
was presumably the cause of death.
Ex-Warden Halo had been ailing for
several years. He failed noticeably dur
ing the time Durrant, the murderer, was
confined In the prison, and directly after
the execution of that criminal his decline
was still more apparent.
Despite his falling health, Mr. Hale had
been carrying on a stock broking business
in this city since his resignation as head
of the penitentiary. Last evening he was
taken suddenly 111 at his home and his
death came soon afterward.
It Is not' thought that the ex-Warden
left much of an estate. He was known
throughout the length and breadth of the
State, being one of California's prominent
political characters.
William E. Hale, was born at Hollls, N.

old revolutionary stock. While he was

OAKLAND, July 11. â As usual, the
people are paying the piper, no
matter for which side he pipes. To
be a little more specific, the city of
Oakland is paying the expenses of the lit
igation that is being waged against It by
the Contra Costa Water Company in Its
effort to make the people pay interest
upon an inflated valuation of the corpora
tion's plant.
This is what the Injunction Issued by
Judge Hart yesterday preventing the en
forcement of the new water rate ordi
nance did. .'It forced the people of Oak
land to supply the sinews of war to the
water company and at the figures select
ed by the water company itself. So the
water rate payers of Oakland have the
supreme satisfaction of knowing that the
money that they pay Into the coffers of
the Contra Costa Water Company is be
ing used partly to prosecute the litiga
tion that is expected not only to restore
the old rates but to bring the water rates
of the city up to a point higher than ever
before.
The constitution of the State of Califor
nia prohibits a water company from col
lecting illegal rates under penalty of the
forfeiture of its plant and franchise.
Judge Hart has issued an Injunction un
der which the Contra Costa Water Com
pany has fixed its own water rates. The
prerogatives of the Oakland City Council
have been usurped by the Contra Costa
Water Company, which has named the
water rates for the city. Under this In
junction the Contra Costa Water Com
pany is collecting the rates that it has it
self fixed, and the people, the Council and
the constitution no longer count. Such
things as the elected representatives of
the people and the organic law of the
State are passe and are to be relegated to
the scrap heap of uselessness when it
comes to dealing with corporations.
Collection of Rates Begins.
The Contra Costa Water Company be
gan the collection of water rates for July
to-day. It is true that the bond of the
company, which it agreed to furnish and
which the injunction order of Judge Hart
requires, was not filed until late this after
noon, but this very slight irregularity
made no difference, and the collection of
water rates began early in the morning.
The Contra Costa Water Company has
Issued Its regular bills for July, but there
has been printed in red ink across the face
of the bill a little Indorsement which
reads:
Received amount specified to be held until
the final determination of the litigation involv
ing validity of ordinance establishing rates
for the year beginning July 1. 1900. and ending
June 30, 1901. If ordinance be held valid,
amount to be applied In payment at legal rate,
balance to be returned, without Interest. If
held invalid amount to be in payment for
water specified.
CONTRA COSTA WATER CO..
bills for July at exactly the same rate a.s
charged under the old water ordinance,
and we are collecting upon that basis.
The agreement that is printed across the
face of the bill is signed by our collec
tors and Is a guarantee to the rate payer
that we will do as we promised about re
bating or refunding the difference should
the ordinance be declared legal. Ot
course, we do not believe that the ordi
nance which would have gone Into effect
at the first of this month Is legal. We
will collect under the old rates and will
hold that money in trust for the rate
payers until a final decision by the court
as to what rate* shall prevail. We have
secured a temporary suspension of the
new ordinance. That is all that I was
fighting for. It remains with the attor
neys to do the rest."
In the afternoon President Watlclnson
filed with County Clerk Jordan the bond
required/ with Alvinza Hayward and Wil
liam J. Dingee as sureties. There was
filed also an agreement with the bond and
copies of the Injunction and the order
granting the injunction. What will be
done now by either side is not being di
vulged, except that the Contra Costa
Water Company is going ahead with its
collection of water rates.
No Move to Examine Books.
The city of Oakland haa secured Its per
mission to examine the books of the
water company and has sixty days in
which to do this work. Though the city
was at liberty to begin work to-day noth
ing In this direction was done. No appli
cation was made to the officials of the
water company for the books, and It was
announced by Attorney Robert Y. Hayne
that the city would not be ready to move
for a day or two.
"Thcv have pot their order for the ex
amination of the books," said President
J. H. T. Watkinson of the Contra Costa
Water Company, "and, of course, we will
allow the examination when they are
ready."
"Are all the books In the possession of
the company?" was asked of Mr. Wat
kinson.
"I have nothing to say upon that
point," replied Mr. Watkinson. "but un
der the order of the court we â¢will give
them every facility that we possess."
It is a little difficult to discover the
plans of either side. Special Counsel Rob
ert V. Hayne refuses to talk for publica
tion and City Attorney Dow Is out of
town on his vacation. What the city ex
pects to get and what it will get are both
matters of conjecture.
It Is more than probable that Attorney
Hayne â¢will appeal from the order of
Judge Hart, but what form the appeal
will take is also a matter of conjecture.
Mr. Hayne took an exception to the order
yesterday. Indicating some move of this
kind.
The Bond and Agreement.
The bond and the agreement filed by
the Contra Costa Water Company this
afternoon constitute a very interesting ae
ries of documents, a study In how not to
say things. They read:

A wall of rock torn asunder by a heavy
blast of dynamite crushed the residence
of Patrick Fee, 3001 College avenue,
Berkeley, to-day, wrecking the dwelling
and causing its occupants to flee for their
lives. The disaster was due to the use of
too heavy a charge of explosive in the
work of tearing out the mass of rock
which is being destroyed in the grading
of College avenue.
Fee's place looked as if It had been In
the path of a Nebraska cyclone after the
shower of huge bowlders had ceased to
rain upon the debris of his little home
The front of the house was completely
wrecked, all that remained being the
splintered boards and the holes in the
few standing sections, where masses of
stone had been hurled with the violence
of a catapult through the walls.
One great bowlder tore along the front
and swept away the steps and entrances
as cleanly as if they had been cut with a
huge knife. Companion blocks of rock
played havoc with the roof and sides.
There were in the dwelling two or three
persons, including Fee, wno had barely
time to clear out before the wreck. Fee
was slightly cut by a section of the fall
ing walls of his house.
The blast tore up his well-kept gardens
and walks and left little but complete
ruin where had stood a tasty home, sur
rounded with pretty embellishments In
cultivated plants and foliage. Fee de
| clares he win recover for the damage
I wrought to his home, which, it is esti
mated, will reach $1500.

J. Whltver. I>ira E. Rurtch has implored
The holp of the law to aid hir in securing

appear before Ju/lge Ellsworth to show
cause why she bas not complied with the
terms of the will.
Mrs. Bunch also wants the executrix
to explain why she has not rendered an
account of her administration. She

that no Inventory has bet n filed in court

CONTRACTS APPROVED
BY CARTER'S SUPERIORS
Chief Clerk Sterley's Testimony in
Green-Gaynor Extradition
Proceedings.
NEW YORK, July 11.â The hearing in
the proceedings for the removal of B. L).
Greene and J. F. and E. R. Gaynor to
the jurisdiction of the Georgia Federal
Court, was resumed to-day before United
States Commissioner Shields. J. W. O.
Sterley, who was chief clerk under Cap
tain Carter, identified one by one the
various contracts made by General Gil
more and Captain Carter for the Govern
ment work and Mr. Erwin ottered them in
evidence. Some of them dated back to
1SS4. Counsel for defense objected to
them, but Commissioner Shields overruled
all objections. Mr. Rose of counsel for
the defense argued that General Gilmore
was not suspected of any complicity in
the frauds and the District Attorney ex
plained that he desired the contracts
made by General Gilmore In evidence to
show how the prices had increased after
Captain Carter had sole control of the
bids put in by contractors. .
Cross-examined, ' Sterley testified that
every one of tho contracts Introduced was
approved by one or more officers superior
to Captain Carter. Two or three of them
wore approved by the Secretary of War.
Captain Gillette, who in July took charge
of the Southern harbor improvement
work, identified drawings of log and
brush mantles built by the Gaynors under
a contract with General Gilmore and sim
ilar drawings of work done by them under
contracts made with Captain Carter. Mr.
Erwin, replying to the objections of tho
defense, said there was a difference of
nearly 400 per cent in the prices charged.
Captain Gillette was still on the stand
when the court adjourned until to-mor

Attempt to Wreck and Loot an Ex
press on the Baltimore and
Ohio.
PHILADELPHIA, July 11.â According
to officials of the Baltimore and Ohio Rail
road, another attempt to rob the "Wash
ington Express, believed to be carrying
$3,000,000 in gold to the sub-treasury in
New York, came near being successful
early to-day at Folsom, a short distance
outside of this city. The train, which con
sisted of two sleepers, two day coaches
and three baggage cars,, left Washington
at 11:30 last night. It was due here at 3:10
this morning. An open switch at Folsom
overturned the ensine and derailed the
three baggage cars, but no one was In
jured.
Examination disclosed the fact that the
switch had been tampered with. The rail
road officials have placed detectives on
the rase and have offered a reward of $500
for the arrest or conviction of those tam
pering with the switch. General Agent
Rust of the United States Express Com
pany said that notwithstanding reports
to the contrary, there was no gold bullion
belonging to the government on the train,
and whatever money was being carried
was what came in the ordinary course of
business. This, he saldajfcvas all In dyna
mite-proof safes. The l>ws to the express
company will be trifling.
PADUCAH, Ky., July ll.-The Illinois
Central fast train from New Orleans to
Chicago was held up and robbed this
morning at 1:20 o'clock, two miles south
of Wickliffe, Ky. ( The train was flagged
and when it stopp'ed the bandits entered
the cab. The llreman, J. J. Fryisch, was
struck on the head with the butt of a re
volver and badly hurt.^ The robbers, six
in number, cut off the engine . and express
car and ran a mile and a half to Fort
Jefferson, near the Ohio River and -within
sight of the Missouri shore. Here they
blewopenthe express safe and took all the
valuables it contained. Then they crossed
Into Missouri. They dropped one package
containing? $700 on the Kentucky side and
another package on the Missouri 'side,
both of which have been recovered. The
robbers did not attempt to molest the pas
sengers.
A special train with bloodhounds and an
armed pqsse left Jackson for the scene
and It is expected Missouri officers are hot
on the robbers' trail. About $10,000 was
secured. In addition to the money dropped
by the robbers.

Residents In the neighborhood of Pacific

DISTRICT THAT IS IN
UNSANITARY CONDITION
Patrolman Charles Green to Answer
a Serious Charge Before the
Police Board.
Policeman' Charles Green has an. unen
viable record of "walking on the carpet"
before the Police Commissioners. He
seems to bear a charmed position on the
force, as every time he makes his bow
before the board and Is momentarily start
led by having one month's salary taken
from him he goes back to his beat smil
ing.
At the meeting of the Commissioners
Tuesday night a charpe against him of
not making returns of fire alarms on hla
beat was called, but continued till next
meeting. Now he will have to answer to
another and more serious allegation. His
beat is on Devlsadero street, between
"Waller and O'Farrell. About 2 o'clock on
the morning of July 7 he was missed from
his beat and a search revealed him placid
ly asleep In the rear of the O'Farrell
street police station. The only explana
tion he could make was that he had "that
tired feeling."

the declaration Is made that the buildings are

- Deputy Jordan reports the departments of the

cept as to French and German, the reason be
lne the insufficiency of pupil3 for a two years

other things the school needs $1000 for labora

The schools being examined in arithmetic,
spelling, grammar, geography and history un
der direction of the Board of Education, the
oral examinations by deputies have been main
ly confined to other branches. One year ago
it was rare that. entire classes won promotion
by the written examinations then given by
order of the Board of Education, and In cases
scarcely any of some classes were promoted.
This year the promotion of entire classes and
nearly entire classes seem to have been quite
common. This would indicate greatly Improved
work in the schools during the past year.
ited by Superintendent Webster and Dep
uties Kingsbury, Jordan and Howard was
submitted to the Board of Education at Its
meeting yesterday. The report says:
I Chairman Mark of the Board of Edu
cation Is Â«n communication with Dr. C. E.
Ehinger. head of the department of
Physical Culture In the Westchester
Normal School In Pennsylvania, with a
view to the acceptance by Dr. Ehinger of
a similar post in the local school depart
ment. The salary offered to Dr. Ehinger
Is $2400 per year, but he is holding out for
$3000 per year. Mr. Marks says that Dr.
Ehinger Is a competent physical instruc
tor and the fact tttat his wife is also an
able instructress 'in the art has Impelled
the board to make a bid for their services.
Mr. Mark has not yet lost all hope of se
curing the two teachers and the deal. may
be consummated in a few days. They
have made a special study of children's
games and If engaged will establish the
study of physical culture on the basis ad
vocated by the board.
Regarding the dismissal of Professors
Stahl. Miehling and Barth. Mr. \ Mark
Bays that one cf the reasons for the dis
missal was that the teachers were re

only half a day and they refused to do so.

The Oceanic Steamship Company's
Moana sailed for Australasian ports last
night. The mail was on time, and, strange
to say, the vessel got away within a few
hours of her regular time. Passing Fort
Point Chief Oflicer Crisp discovered a
couple of stowaways and had them sent
ashore, much to .the disgust of the "free
riders" and their friends.
J The Hawaiian contingent and their
friends were much In evidence. The
Moana is a British bottom, and in conse
quence cannot carry freight or passen
gers between here and Honolulu (an
American coast port). M. M. Estee. the
new District Judge of Hawaii, was to havÂ«
gone on the vessel, but under the law of
June 14 he was debarred, and Purser Hod
son was prevented from having his Honor
on his passenger list.
Judge Estee will go to his district on tho
Rio de Janeiro next week. The Moana is
crowded with freight, but the passenger
list Is light, owing to the interdiction on
Hawaiian trade.
San Juan Arrives
The chartered steamer San Juan arrived
from Nome yesterday morning. She brings
little news that has not already been pub
lished in The Call. General George H.
Randall, U. S. A., who is in .charge of the
military camp, has this to say in the
Nome Gold Digger in addition to the
Btory already published:
"It is wise to give the truth to the outside,
else all kinds of wild stories are liable to be
sent out about alleged lawlessness, when It
does not exist. There is a bad element here.
It is true. but. that element can be" managed
very well. The mo9t serious thing we have
to consider Is the typhoid fever. There are a
number of cases already, and there is sure to
be many more. The camp must clean up. The
conditions in the rear of some of the saloons
are frightful. It Is a serious menace to health.
I will attend to the cleaning up promptly."
When the San Juan sailed the hospitals
were full of patients, and the doctors es
timated that there would be 1500 cases re
quiring attention Inside of two weeks. In
that event the next steamer coming from
Nome will probably bring news of an
epidemic.

NEWS FROM THE
OCEAN ID THE
WATER FRONT
The. action of the Board of Education
in dismissing Professors Earth, Miehling
and Stahl, the. three special . teachers of
phs'slcal culture, has met with determined
opposition on the part of the German resi
dents of this city. At its meeting yester
day, the board was served with a strong
petition signed by the German-Califor
nian Society to restore the teachers to
their positions, and also to re-establish
the study. of physical culture, which, it is
claimed, has been practically abolished by
their dismissal. The communication,
which was read with no comment on the
part of the Directors and taken under ad
visement, is as follows:
Voice a Strong Protest.
At a meeting of the German-Californian
Society a discussion was participated in by
men of considerable education and experi
ence in educational matters as well as of
high social and business standing in this
community. Opinions were freely uttered,
not only that your action In dismissing the
three teachers was hasty, but that the rea
sons as stated in the resolution are utterly
Insufficient to Justify the proceeding which
you have taken. It was the sense of the
meeting that if the present corps of three
special teachers Is entirely inadequate to
give the required Instruction often enough.
It cannot, with consistency, be maintained
that the amount of instruction which the
three teachers are able to {rive is of no
value to the child, or that the Instruction
ought to be wholly dispensed with. On the
contrary, that It should be the aim of the
board intrusted with the care of our chil
dren to increase the number of teachers of
physical culture. Instead of dismissing the
few thus far employed.
1 The gentlemen of our society further won
dered what the board could have meant by
the "sound physiological, psychological and
pedagogical basis" on which you "hope"
to place the teaching of physical culture, or
In what respect the system followed by the
dismissed teachers may have appeared to
your minds to be other than sound. By
making that implication it was the opinion
of some of our members that you were not
aware that the methods of teaching fol
lowed by these teachers are the results of
the most careful thought and experience,
commencing about the early part of the
nineteenth centurry (when Jahn Introduced
the new art) and continued through genera
tions; nor the fact that all of the three
teachers dismissed by your board are grad
uates of the "Turnlehrer-Seminar nt Mil
waukee, established in 1?91 by the Xorth
American Turnverein (which at present
numbers 40.000 members) and containing
the very best equipment for the teaching
of physical culture; nor the fact that an
other of these graduates. - who Is now at
the head of the department of physical cul
ture In the Military Academy at West
Point, was given the rank of captain in the
regular army in recognition of his services,
and that his methods have beeh adopted at
all the army posts. '
Tour statement that "the present system
of gymnastic exercises can be taught Just as
effectively by class teachers supervised by
the principals" appears to be somewhat in
consistent with the hope you entertain to
change the present system on a physiolog
ical, psychological and pedagogical basis.
The assertion that class teachers possess the
ability to teach the present system of gym
nastics as effectively as the three gentlemen
specially trained in. the art. and against
whose competency and eminent fitness for
the work not a word has been said, wa3
strongly denied by the members of our so
ciety.
A vote having been taken. It -was unani
mously resolved that as a matter of public
duty and. in behalf of the most sacred In
terests of our children and the future of this
community, the attention of your honor-
able board be called to the facts herein al
luded to and that the suggestion should be
respectfully made to you not to deprive our
school children of what has proved an ines
timable blessing- to them, but to restore to
their places both the "present system of
gymnastic exercises" and the three excel
lent teachers of physical culture so hastily
and summarily dismissed from the depart
ment. German-California Society.
GUSTAV GUTSCH, President.
School for South San Francisco.
The board adopted a resolution recom
mending to the Board of Supervisors that
the sum of SSO.OOO be appropriated out of
the excess revenues to construct a new
schoolhouse In South San Francisco to
replace the old Burnett School, which has
been condemned as unsanitary. This ac
tion was taken as a result of the follow
ing resolution adopted by the Federation
of Mission Improvement Clubs and sent
to the board for consideration:
Resolved. That the Burnett school house
In South San Francisco, having been al
ready condemned by the Health Department
and by the Fire Warden?, and said con
demnation being found well founded by the
investigation of a special committee of this
federation, we are of the opinion that the I
present building should be destroyed and
a, new one erected; and we request the
Board of Education to make a requisition
at once on the Board of Public Works for
plans and specifications for the same* In
accordance with the reports oCthe two pub
lic bodies mentioned.
Salaries of Principals.
Superintendent Webster questioned the
advisability of passing such a resolution,
and Director Denman contended that the
Burnett School was amply sufficient for
the needs of the district. Attorney Kim
ball, who appeared for the federation,
stated that if something were not done
to put the Burnett School In sanitary con
dition the parents would decline to send
their children to the institution. Director
Casserly stated that he had gone before
the Supervisors to urge that the building
be repaired, but no action had been taken.
Mrs. K. Black, janltress of the Everett
School, against whom charges had been
preferred by the principal,. was dismissed
from the department and Mrs. Rors, as
sistant janitress, was Instructed to take
charge of the school.
The recretary wa9 Instructed to adver
tise . for bids to paint the Whittler and
Hamilton schools.

WOULD HAVE THE
PUPILS TRAINED
IN GYMNASTICS
; The Supervisors, In session as a board
of equalization yesterday, refused to re
duce the assessment of $750,000 on the
franchise of the Bank of CaJiforr.ia. Sev
eral members of the board strongly fa
vored raising it to $1,000,000, but such ac
tion was not taken.
James M. Allen appeared as the legal
representative of the bajik and made an
extended argument. Though not admit
i ting: the Assessor's right to fix any as-
J seument on the franchise Judge Allen
taid the bank was willing to pay taxes on
an assessment of $10,000. If any large as
sessment were allowed to stand the bank
! would fight It in the courts.
I "We have but one franchise." Judge Al
len said, "and that is simply the power
to exist as a corporation. Our right to do
a banking business Is a common right
| ard may be possessed by an individual or
I & partnership. For that power there is
do franchise within the meaning: of the
law.
"Our right to exist as a corporation has
no franchise value. We cannot sell it, we
cannot mortgage It.
"Last year we paid taxes amounting to
over $36,000. If a $12,000 tax on this fran
chise assessment is levied and paid the
amount will be W7.663 for this year. None
of the -national banks of the State pay
such a large tax. Xcne of them pays over
$ooi-0.
"We have substantially said that we
will pay on an assessment of $10,000 be
cause the taxes then would be small, but
> if the exorbitant assessment of $750,000
I for the right simply to exist as a corpora
j tion is allowed to stand it will be con-
I tested."
] Assessor Dodge claimed that the right
, to tax the franchises cf private corpora
] tions. including banks, had repeatedly
i beÂ«>n upheld by the Supreme Court.
"Why is the Rank of C.-ilifornia singled
I out." continued the Assessor, "to be made
j the object of a franchise assessment?
, Simply because it is the only bank of
! San trancisco that is not paying taxes
: on an assessment representing its capital !
, stock or more. The Union Trust Company
was not doing this until I assessed Its
franchise at $50.) MJ and it is now paying
taxes on that assessment.
"There have been numerous Supreme
Court decisions emphasizing and uphold
ing the right to get back of the shadow,
the franchise, to the substance. This
bank's capital stock has a market value
of $s.100,000. It paid taxes last year on
$o.125,So2 only, and included in that total
is a largp amount invested in domestic
bonds, declared exempt. But taking that
total.. there Is a value of S2.P74.64S that was.
not taxed. For the purposes of assess
ment that may be taken as the value of
the Bank of California's franchise.
"This bank, if assessments are. to be
equalized, should have its franchise as
sessment raised to $2,374,000, but to be con
servative I placed it at $750.0in>. The tax
en that basis will amount to but GO cents
per year per share, while the dividends
per year per share amount to $16."
The board took the petition of the bank
under advisrmont. Supervisor McCarthy
favored raising the assessment to $1,000,000
and moved that the bank should be noti
fied to appear and show cause why its
assessment should not be ralsedl Super
visor Curtis seconded the motion.
"I am strongly opposed to such action."
Supervisor Braunhart said. "Let us act
carefully and conservatively in these re
form matters. I am not advocating len
iency toward the banks. They have
avoided taxes and have sent their repre
sentatives to Sacramento to defeat wise
legislation. But at the same time, we
should make haste slowly. Our position
will be stronger if we let the Assessor's
figures stand."
On the vote that followed the petition
was denied. The bank will undoubtedly
carry the ma.tter j into the courts.
K. J. McCutchen was present as attor
ney for the Virginia and Gold Hill Water
Company, the franchise of which was as
sessed at $250,000. He agreed that the
franchises of private corporations may
be taxed, but argued that it was unfair
to tax more than nominally corporations
that, received nothing from the State.
"Our company does no business and ex
ercises ijio rights here. We simply have
an oiticn in this city as a matter of con
venience, because a majority of our stock
is held here."
Supervisor McCarthy inquired if the
case was not parallel vith that of the Pa
cilic Mail Company, which does no busi
ness in New York, but pays taxes there
on its entire capital stock. McCutchon
paid that he unterstood some of his com
pany's stock had been assessed, as well as
tho franchise.
"Thnt was because a few of the holders
turned thorn in." said the Assessor. "But
Mr. Mackay and the Hobart estate will
not turn in their stock, claiming that they
cannot be assessed."
Attorney McOutchen denied- the Asses
sor's estimate of $1 .000.000 as the value of
the company's capital stock. He said it
could nil bÂ»Â» bought for J2TÂ»0,000, or $5 per
share.' instead r-t $20.
"I will say this, gentlemen." Mr. JIc-
Cutchcn said, "you can uphold this as
sessment if. you want to. but you will not
havÂ« a chance to do it again. If you car
ry out this policy you will drive away
thousands of corporations. Our objection
is on the brond prnuml that it is not right
for you to tax the franchise of a company
that pot? nothing 1 from you."
Supervisor <*omto argued that while It
was right to tax the franchises of public
or quasi-public corporations, it was not
wise to adopt a policy that would drive
private corporation?; from San Francisco.
Braunhart moved that the assessment be
reduced to $12">.000. and Comte seconded
the motion. The Assessor concurred and
the reduction was made.
Gavin McNab as attorney for the Ar
mour Packing Company opposed the as
bQ^mont of $10,000 on its franchise. The
company intends to fight the assessment
on the pround that the franchise of a for
eiRn corporation Is not subject to tax
ation. The attorney desired action by the
board in order that the assessment might
be tested in court. The petition for the
was denied.
An assessment of $150,000 apalnst the
estate of Alexander Dunsmuir was can
celed on the recommendation of Assessor
Dodge. The assessment was on stock of
the R. Dunsmulr'p Sons Company, a
domestic corporation. Numerous peti
tions involving assessments of small
amounts were rcted upon. The board will
continue the work this afternoon at 1-SO
o'clock. . .
The Contra Costa "Water Company peti
tioned for a correction of the assessment
on Its franchise, which Assessor Dodtre
fixed at J2M.OTI0. on the ground that 'he

A\ ells. Farffo & Co. also petitions to be
released from an assessment on Its fran
chise of $750,000.
The estate of r>. B. Henarle wants the
n-sosFmont on 2500 shares of Eastern
