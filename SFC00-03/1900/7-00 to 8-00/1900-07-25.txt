VON BULOW HOLDS UP KWANG SU'S PLEA
UNTIL FATE OF LEGATIONS IS KNOWN
TIENTSIN, Saturday, July 21. â The Russians announce their intention to keep control
of the entire railway line between Taku and Peking- until the conclusion of hostilities, when they
purpose, they say, to restore it to the Chinese.
Admiral Seymour strongly disapproves allowing' them to repair the line beyond Tientsin.
He considers that the British should insure the undertaking and conduct the repairs.
Meanwhile the French are endeavoring to obtain control of all the river tugs. It is be
lieved that they intend to share the control with Russia.

"The President of the United States to
the Emperor of China-Greeting: I have
received your Majesty's message of July
19. and am slad to know that your
Majesty 1 recognizes the fact that the Gov
ernment and the people of the United
States desire of China nothing but what
is Just and equitable. The purpose for
which we landed troops In China was tho
rescue of our legation from grave danger
and the protection of the lives and prop
erty cf Americans who were sojourning in
China, In the enjoyment of rights guar
anteed them by treaty and by interna

licly declared by all the powers which
have landed military forces iri your
Majesty's empire.
"I am to infer from your Majesty's let

turbed the peace of China, who have mur
dered the Minister of Germany and a
member of the Japanese legation, and
who now hold besieged in Peking those
foreign diplomats who still survive, havo
not only not received any favor cfr en

actually in rebellion against the imperial
authority. If this be the case I mest
solemnly urge upon your Majesty's Gov

the foreign Ministers are alive, and if so
In what condition.

9 fcASHIXOTON. JÂ«ly 24.â The De
&Q_B partment of Htnte to-day made
w^^ public the Chinese appeal for
mediation and the President's
reply. The Chinese appeal Is unques
tionably an adroit .proposition. The Presi
dent's answer is equally clever and more
sincere; that is the opinion of the officials
here who have studied both. Following is
the translation of a cablegram received
by Minister Wu on July 20. 1900, from the
Taotai of Shanghai, dated July 19. 1900:
"Have received a telegram from Gover
nor Yuan of Shantung, dated 23d day of
the moon, July ID, who, having received
from the Privy Council at Peking a dis
patch embodying an imperial letter to
the United States, has Instructed me to
transmit it to your Excellency. The im
perial message is respectfully transmitted
as follows:
" 'To his Excellency the President of
the United Statesâ Greeting: China has
long maintained friendly relations with
the United States and is deeply conscious
that the object of the United States Is
international commerce. Neither country
entertains the least suspicion or distrust
toward the other. Recent outbreaks of
mutual antipathy between the people and
Christian missions caused the foreign
powers to view with suspicion the position
of the Imperial Government and favorable
to the people and prejudicial to. the mis
sions, with the result that the Taku forts
were attacked and captured. Consequent
ly there has been clashing of forces, with
calamitous consequences.. The situation
has become more and more serious and
critical. "We have just received a tele
graphic memorial from our envoy, Wu
Ting Fang, and it Is highly gratifying
to learn that the United States Govern
ment, having in view the friendly rela
tions between the two countries, has
taken a deep interest in the present sit
uation. Â¦Â« Xow, China, driven by the ir
resistible course of events, has unfortu^
nateiy incurred well nigh universal in
dignation. For settling the present diffi
culty China places special reliance In the
United States. "We address this message
to your Excellency in all sincerity and
candldness. with the hope that your Ex
cellency will devise measures and take
the initiative in bringing about a concert
of the powers for the restoration of order
and peace. The favor of a kind reply is
earnestly requested and awaited with the
greatest anxiety. KWANG SU."
" 'Twenty-sixth year, sixth moon.
twenty-third day (July ID).'
"It is therefore my duty to transmit the
above, with the request that your Excel-
official, will have to forego the Emperor's
assertion that he would not stop until
the German flag floated over Peking.
As for the 1 other powers, it is emphati
cally stated that they have unanimously
agreed that- with the safe delivery of the
Ministers the aggressive campaign will
end. All rumors of an International
agreement regarding- the future of China
subsequent to the return of the Minis
ters are false.
The agreement is purely negative, and
based upon the l.nes stated by Secretary
Hay, ot which the independence and in
tegrity of the Chinese, empire are essen
tial features. If the imperial edict proves
true, the powers, while holding their
forces in readiness to enforce demands,
will accept pecuniary indemnity. No ter
ritorial propositions will be considered.
In common with the other powers, Ger
many must, through arbitration or other
wise, gauge the damage sustained by the
loss of the life of her Minister by a pecu
niary standard. The same rule will ap
ply as to the loss of other lives and the
destruction of property.
RUSSIAN FORCE HARD
PRESSED BY BOXERS
ST. PETERSBURG, July 24.-A dis
patch v.-hich has been received from Gen
eral Grodekoff at Khabarovick, dated
July 22, reports that the steamer Odessa,
which left Charbin July 16, brought tid
ings of the Russian force that left Te
lin July 7, en route to Charbin.
It appears that 1100 men started, with
a large convoy of Chinese . Christians,
women and â¢ children. After constant
fighting, which was often at close quar
ters and with bayonet, they were again
attacked by Boxprs on July 12. The Rus
sians lost heavily and ran short of am
munition. At -last accounts they were
threatened by 15,000 Boxers. Engineer
Jugovlch. at Charbin, had found it im
possible to send efficient help, as he re
quired all his available forces to defend
Chnrbin, which place contained thou
sands of unarmed employes, with their
families, which have been concentrated
from along many sections of the railway.
General Grodekoff considers the situ
ation to ' be bad. Attacks are daily
threatened, and rebels and marauders are
overrunning Manchuria. The general
says the local Governors have little au
thority, and that fanatics dominate the
situation. i - .Â¦â¢',?â¢Â¦
I A ONDOJC. July 24.â The Chinese Mln-
Jf ister, Sir Chih Chen Lo Feng L.uh.
C^f had a long Interview with Lord
Salisbury this afternoon. The gen
eral situation was discussed, and the
Chinese Minister asserted his belief that
the British Minister to China, Sir Claude
Jilacdonald, and the other foreigners at
Peking-, were safe. Lord Salisbury reit
erated his demand for direct communi
cation with the Minister at Peking. To
t/is request the Minister could only re
yew his protestations that It would be
/peedily accomplished if feasible. He ad-
Buced no new facts .to prove his asser
tions. The interview closed without re
sult.
Despite the Chinese Minister's state
ments and despite Sir Claude Macdon
ald's letter of July 4, a strong impression
continues to prevail- at the Foreign Of
fice that the Ministers at Peking, were
massacred on July 6. Not one scintilla
of evidence is yet in the possession of the
Foreign Office leading it to disbelieve the
reports of the murders. Sir Claude Mac
donald's letter, -with Its account of se
vere fighting in Peking, merely confirms
the Government's forebodings.
William P. Morgan, member of Par
liament for Merthyr Tydvll. whose
knowledge of and interests in China are
extensive, said to-day that he was posi
tive from cable messages from his agents
that the members of the legations were
alive on July 9. ' When the Foreign Of
fice was told this, the rejoinder was
made: .
"Mr. Morgan has submitted no evidence
to convince us of the truth of his state
ment, however anxious we may be to be
lieve it."
Will Not Partition China.
Consultations are in progress between
Cabinet Ministers and officials as to the
course to be pursued should the Ministers
prove to be alive. The contingency of
China holding them as hostages is upper
most in the minds of all, although the
Chinese diplomats have not as yet hinted
at such action. .
Negotiations between the powers have
brought out- mutual asurances that the
military expeditions to China are for the
sole purpose of relieving the legations,
and that there is no intention to partition
China. Hence, should China agree to
deliver the Ministers alive, no power will
have reason for continuing aggressive
military operations except Germany,
whose Minister is undoubtedly dead, and

@$ OXDOX, July 24. â The Foreign Office has received a dispatch from the British Consul at
fJL Tientsin, dated Saturday, July 21, stating that he had just received a letter from Sir
Claude Macdonald, the British Minister at Peking, and dated July 4, appealing for re
lief. There were enough provisions at the legation to last a fortnight, the letter said, but the gar
rison was unequal to the task of holding out against a determined attack for many days.
There had been forty-four deaths and about double that number wounded.
The Foreign Office thinks the dispatch does not affect the main question of the reported
massacre of members of the legation at Peking.
PARIS, July 24. â Four dispatches from the French Consul at Tientsin, dated severally
July 13, 14, 17 and 18, and forwarded from Chefu July 18 to 20, have been received by the Min
ister of Foreign Affairs, M. Delcasse. The dispatch dated July 13 says a courier from Peking re
lates that since June 20 the foreign Ministers have been besieged in the British legation, and that
the marines were making a vigorous defense. The supply of ammunition was low, and the peril
of those in the legation was great. Up to the time the courier left Peking the loss of the marines
had been sixteen killed and seventeen wounded.
The dispatch dated July 14 announces the taking of Tientsin. The message of the 17th
says the city of Tientsin was quiet. A courier had been dispatched to Peking-, and his return was
expected in seven days.
The dispatch of July j8 says the military chiefs of the allied forces were at that time de
liberating as to the form of government that should be given Tientsin.
The Consul had received no dispatches forwarded from Paris since June 20.
Sir Claude Macdonald, Writing on July 4, An
nounced That Forty-Four Foreigners in
Peking Had Already Been Slain.
To apply a biblical phrase to the Peking situation, while the world asks for br&atf the Chinese authorities serve out
stones in superabundant measure. A belated letter from Sir Claude Macdonald brought reliable news from the legations down
to the date of July 4, five days later than the message from the Japanese Minister, which left Peking on June 29; but, it is
pointed out in London, ahead of the critical date of July 6-7, which Shanghai reports have named as the day of the final attack
upon the British legation- . . .â 'â¢.;,.
A conservative correspondent, whose special dispatch is published In this morning's Call, transmits from Shanghai an
entertaining story of how General Yung Lu at Peking met a messenger from the British legation on July 19 and sent him back to
the Ministers with assurances of friendship. This and a sheaf of Chinese reports spread broadcast throughout the world's capi
tals only tend to strengthen the suspicion which obtains in many quarters.
Emperor Kwang Su's appeal to President McKinley and the latter's reply, an outline of which was published in The
Call yesterday, are given in full. The United States Government makes the assent of the other powers concerned conditional to
its mediation on behalf of China. Irritation at the attitude taken by Washington has found vent in Berlin, where contrasts were
drawn between Mr. McKinley's response and the reply given by Count von Bulnw to the Chinese appeal addressed to the Ger
man Emperor, all unfavorable to the former.
!t is said the State Department has evidence that Russian troops are advancing on Peking from the north and that the
Czar may withdraw from the international alliance.
BRITISH MINISTER'S LETTER
APPEALING FOR RELIEF
THE CALL'S SUMMARY OF THE CHINESE SITUATION.
There is a strong suspicion that all these telegrams are only intended to gain time while the
Chinese are preparing for another coup. Xo reliance whatever is now placed in these messages
from Chinese official sources.
If the o'fficials of Central and Southern China persuade themselves to believe the partition
of the country is intended, the whole empire will rise against foreigners. Yuan Shai Kai, Gov
ernor of Shantung, has drawn up a definite plan of action for the present crisis, which has been
sent to the Viceroys and Governors.
The substance of this plan is the generals who are marching to the rescue of the Emperor
must not attack Prince Titan or the Boxers. If the members of the legations have really been mur
dered the Western powers, he says, will try to destroy Peking. The generals must help Prince Tuan
and the Boxers to avert this. They must form a rearguard during tlie flight of the Empress to
Singan Fu, where a new capital will be established.
All ports and cities accessible to foreign warships must be strengthened and a solid front
presented. This will induce the foreigners to make peace.
Overtures must begin promptly, war preparations proceeding concurrently. The Governor
adds that diplomacy always helps China. He further says the export of arms and munitions from
Europe is being stopped and the Chinese arsenals must therefore work double 'time.
Viceroys south of Hoangho must continue to protect foreigners until the court are safely
at Singan Fu. when a general war will be inevitable. ?
Should the members of legations be alive and the partitioning of China really disclaimed,
the generals who are moving north-will order the Boxers to disperse on pain of atack. Peace will
then easily follow.

JAPANESE FOREIGN MINISTER URGES
SOUTHERN VICEROYS TO OPPOSE BOXERS
YOKOHAMA, July 24.â It is rumored that the Japanese Foreign Minister has been in
constant communication with the southern Viceroys of China, urging them to. mobilize troops and
march northward to restore peace and order.
After the capture of. Tientsin he again enjoined upon them the expediency of placing
themselves alongside the foreign troops, thereby showing China's determination to crush the
rebels and to fulfill the treaty obligations of China,
J The Viceroys hesitated, It is said, to accept the responsibility, but it is believed that they
used their influence in Peking, with the result that the Emperor's party resumed control.
BERLIN, July 24. â Count von Bulow, Minister of Foreign Affairs, made reply to-day to
the appeal of the Emperor of China for German mediation between the powers and the Chinese
Government. In substance Count von Bulow said he would not submit the telegramifrom
the Peking Government so long as the fate of the legations and other foreigners in Peking
was not ascertained, and as long as the Chinese Government had not atoned for the murder of
the German Minister to Peking, Baron von Ketteler, giving guarantees that in the future^its
conduct will be in harmony with international law and the usages of civilization.

"We have learned in Africa how danger

Elates by the 'heathen Chinese.' "
A whole batch of Tientsin dispatches are
published to-day. All praise the gallantry
of the Americans and Japanese. The
Standard's correspondent says that the
Americana at first made a mistake in
underestimating the fighting capacity of
the Chinese, whose fire was really terrific.
He expresses some doubt about the ability
of the allies to hold the positions cap
tured unless they are reinforced. It ap
pears that large hauls Â«f silver were
made by the allies, the metal being cal
ried away in buckets and the Chinese
calmly assisting.
Requests for mediation, addressed to
foreign powers, are interpreted here, to
be apropos to preparation for a. refluent
of foreign aid to repress the rebellion
and Li Huns Chang's statement that be
could restore order with 20.000 white troops
is looked upon as u subtle argument in
favor of appointing him to the command
of the allied forces, to the exclusion of a
Japanese. The Shanghai correspondent
of the Times, telegraphing Monday, says:
"In an interview to-day Li Hung Chang
reiterated his statement that if thu
Manchu party had been guilty of the hor
rible treachery involved in a massacre of
the members of the legations he would
absolutely refuse to attempt to negotiate.
He said the present intention of the
Tsung-Li-Yamen was to memorialize the
Empress Dowager to revictual the lega

Tientsin under the escort of General Sung

HOTEL, WASHINGTON, July 24.â
Hung Chang's prediction that
the pending of a relief column to
Peking at this time will result i:i
further atrocities on the part of the
Boxers and an outbreak on the part of
the imperial troops obtains indorsement
from Minister Wu Ting Fang to-night.
In response to my questions he said:
"I fear that the starting of the relief
expedition to Peking by the allied forces
will cause fresh outbreaks by the rebels
and further endanger the lives of the
Ministers now in the' capital city. That
is. I believe this, if the reported interview
with Viceroy LI Hung Chang is correct.
Under such conditions the forwarding of
the army will cause the rebels to believe
that the undertaking is for the purpose
of conquering the people and making the
country a spoil. All of the prejudice
against foreigners will be raised to the
highest pitch and the consequences may
ho very serious."

further messages from Minister Conger

In Peking and the fleet Minister Wu is
very confident, but said to-night that it
was still too early to predict results. At
the same time he intimated that success

Minister Wu's Indorsement of the opin
ion of LJ Hung Chang is somewhat at
variance with his previous expressions, a3
he has almost criticized the powers for
not showing greater expedition in getting
troops to the Chinese capital, but his
friends explain this discrepancy by say
ing that he yields to what he considers
superior knowledge of affairs by a man
on the .spot and still clings to the belief
that much anxiety could have been saved
had a sufllcient force been started toward
Peking earlier in the crisis.

Chinese in the walled city report that the
foreigners in Peking- are living, having
taken shelter in a bomb-proof building.
About 7000 Chinese were engaged in the
battle hero July 11. More are coming
from Peking.
General Isieh was imprisoned because
he opposed making war on the foreigners,
but afterward was released on the con
dition that he fight them. To this he ac
ceded -with lukewarmness. After the
battle he committed suicide.
A large part of the walled city was
burned last night, and to-day the Chinese
held a perfect orgie, plundering, smash
ing houses and fighting like demons over
Stores of silks, furs and Jewelry. Hun
dreds of 'dead Chinamen along the walls,

It is rumored that some correspondents
have, in their dispatches, asserted that
General Dorward thinks Colonel Liscum
blundered in taking the Ninth Regiment
to the right instead of to the left, and
that the feeling is strained between the
Americans and British. The fact is that
the greatest harmony and co-operation

HOTEL. WASHINGTON, July 24.
âCablegrams received by the War
Department this afternoon an
nounce that the transport Grant,
having General Chaffee and the Sixth
Cavalry on beard, had just been sighted
oft Nagasaki and shouUl arrive in that
port some time during the night.
General MacArthur was notified by the
Secretary of War several days ago to
be sure to have everything i:i readiness
for the Grant, so that in the process of
taking on coal and supplies she would
not be delayed an unnecessary minute
at Nagasaki. If these instructions have
been carried out it is estimated that her
stay in that port will not exceed ten
hours. This would enable her to leave
for Taku, about 800 miles distant, to-mor
row. The run occupies three days and the
Grant phquld arrive there on Friday. On
fiis arrival General Chaffee will at once
hasten to Tientsin to consult with Rear
Admiral Remey.
Very little is said at tne War Depart
ment concerning the possibility that Gen
eral Chaffee may- be selected to head the
allied forces, but it is admitted that both
he and Admiral Remey will urge that the
selection be decided not upon comparative
rank or upon the number of troops any
particular nation may place in the field,
but rather upon the ability as an organ
izer and a campaigner of the man chosen.
It i3 intimated that upon such grounds
there could be found no stronger leader
than General- Chaffee and that this fact
will be strongly hinted to other foreign
representatives.

Third Cavalry, which marched out of the
fort early to-day and left on the train en
route for San Francisco at 9 o'clock, and
Troops H and I of the Third, which left
here last evening. The four troops muster
400 men and are commanded by Major
Kingsbury. The detachment that left last
night is proceeding via Atlanta and will
meet at Chattanooga the troops that went
to-day. They are expected t>> arrive at
San Francisco Sunday or Monday and

FITTING OUT COLLIERS
WITH MERCHANT CREWS
WASHINGTON. July 24.â The Navy De
j partment is preparing for possible events
arisinsr out of the situation in China. One
of the great difficulties which would con
front the United States in the event of
naval warfare in Chinese waters is the
[ lack of a naval base cloiÂ«e to the scene
of operations. Manila is 2000 miles from
j Taku. while some of the other powers
Â¦ have bases within striking distance. Enp
j land has a base at Wel-Hai-Wei and a
1 coaling station at Chefu, Russia has tho
'. rava! ba.se at Port Arthur and Germany
' one at Kiachau. Besides, in case, of a
! naval war. the ports of China, which in
j ordinary times are open for the purchase
I of all ordinary supplies and stores, would
! be closed. A fleet of colliers will have to
j be utilized to take out coal for our ships
! nnd to ply back and forth between our
I squadrons and Manila. This plan, how
! ever, has 5ts obstacles, owing to the fact
! that foreign countries have gobbled up
' everything afloat which could be utilized
WASHINGTON. July 2Â«. â The I
State Department is again in Y
a waiting: attitude regarding
Oiina. It has frankly, prompt
|y and fully answered the Chi- '
rffr- Emperor's appeal for mediation, and :
the correspondence given publicity to
day makes it appear that the next move i
is for the Chinese Government. It is to i
accept or reject our terms at once, ami j
In either ease the answer must convey j
tidings of the state of affairs at Peking
.ind the welfare cf the legationers. The
belief is not concealed here that the
chances for successful mediation are j
flight. Mediation cannot be forced upon
a party to a cause; it must be accept
iible to all the parties. If the I'nited J
States is to mediate in China's interest j
s-he must first secure the assent of all I
the powers which have suffered in life or
property at Peking. The difficulties in !
jhe way of such an undertaking are likely
to be many and serious, in view of the \
exhibition of feeling in Europe; hut it !
Is, said lure that the United States ;
will cheerfully undertake the task pro- j
Tided it* conditions are met. If it does ;
not succeed in Inducing tho European i
powers to be lenient in their treatment !
of tne Government of China, the I'nited '
{Â¦^at^s Gove rrrrent will not be drawn into
further hostilities after we have taken \
care of our own affairs, but will witn- I
riraw, talcinp carp, however, to let it be j
understood that this Government will not '
p.ilow its proper interests in China to be i
injured by the action of any of the pow- !
ers that may choose to remain obdurate, j
At least one of the great powers is I
under strong suspicion here cf acting
cold-bloodedly End without reg-ard to
sentiment cr anything more tlian the i
rncst material of considerations. It is
believed here that this pewer is quiet
ly taking measures to drop out of the
league at Tientsin anrj conduct a j
campaign en its own acciunt against I
Peking, and it is even sijspected that
this power is already moving troops
toward the Chinese capital.
Ore tact, regarded as now beyond need :
of further demonstration in view of the
Chinese appeal, is that the Chinese olii- j
dais at the coast ports are actually in j
communication with whatever remains of i
the imperial Government at Pekinp. and |
The text #if Kvrans Pu's appeal appears ;
to establish the fact that th- Chinese Gov- i
<*rnment itself Is sanctioning the resist- \
.Tree to the international advance upon i
Peking.
The State Department and the Chinese '
legation substantially agree in the esti- j
mate Â«f six to eight days as the time nee- '<
epsary to pet a reply to the President's i
answer to the appeal of the Chinese Gov- i
rrnment. According to the best informa- j
Tinn hÂ«Â»re. urpent messages are beins I
transmitted between Peking and Shanghai !
by the "flylner express.*! mentioned in '>.
<"nm;ul Fowler's cablegram a few days i

r^lay system of mounted; messengers sim- i

miles from Shanghai to Peking, and this
seems to agree very well Â«vith the spÂ«=-ed
made in forwarding and returning the !
Conger message.
Assuming from Rheng's dispatch that a j
movement was on foot on the lSth to get
Th" forrlcn Ministers Ftartod from Peking
to Ti^nt?in under escort of imperial troops
the State Department would not be sur
jirised to get definite news of them from

t-hort time. The distance from Tientsin to i
Peking Is seventy-five mile?, and at this
peason the trip is usually made by road i
from Peking to Tonfirchoo. a point on th<Â» j
IViho, twelve miles below the capital, and \

The Pallbearers.
The actual pallbearers at the funeral

hymns during- the services in the house
and at the grave. Rev. Bosford Leavltt,
pastor of the First Unitarian Church, will

Townsend that the funeral be private.
But for this fact hundreds would have

It is his intention to attend the funeral.
A number of magnificent floral of

were tokens of high esteem from or
ganizations which appreciated the good
work Mrs. Townsend , did dur

Navy Parlor. N. S. G. W.. sent a shield
of ferns, violets and sweet peas woven
into the American colors. In the center
of the piece were the words printed in

Her Many Charitable Deeds.
As is well known the dead woman was
noted for her charitable deeds. During
the late war her purse was ever open to.
the needs of the soldiers who passed
through this city on their way to the
Philippines. She was constantly In their
midst and saw that the volunteers were
given comforts which the Government
found it impossible to provide at that
time. "When the First Tennessee Regi

and saw that their needs were supplied.
They looked upon her as their guardian
angel and in return for her many kind
nesses presented her with_a beautiful sil
ver loving cup. .
Many Beneficiaries.
There are hundreds of people In this dty
and in the Bast who will learn with re
pret of the death of Mrs. Townsend.
Many of them owe her their gratitude for
aiding them In their studies or in securing
the necessaries of life. Their names will
never be known, because the generous
woman, out of delicacy to the feelings of
the beneficiaries, worked quietly and un
ostentatiously. There are young men
studying in military schools who are on
the road to honorable careers who owe a
debt of gratitude to her goodness of heart.
She has aided artists in their profession
and has contributed hundreds of dollars
to further their alms in life. She would
often read In tho newspapers of a poor
family and -would quietly visit the place
they called home, and leaxnlng of their
needs, open her purse to supply them.
She has been known to have opened
boarding-houses for deserving women.
She has on more than two occasions
bought houses and furnished them so that
the widow of some brave soldier could
rent rooms and thus support herself. At
the benefit entertainment given to aid the
widow of Fireman Sweeney she bought 400
seats and brought as many convalescent
soldiers to the theater ns her guests.
It was often her practice to pick up a
rapped newsboy on th> street, take him to
a clothier's and fit ht^; out from head to
foot with new raiment, and then learn
where he lived and brln? a ray of sun
shine Into some hovel. Her acts of kind
ness have made her famous among the
poor. The latter looked upon her as ain
angel of goodness, and tears of sorrow
were shed when the tidings of her death
were published In the dally press.
RELATIVES IN THE EAST
KNEW MRS. ELLA MURRAY
NEW YORK, July 24,-Mrs. A. S.
Townsend left this State about twenty
years ago and was reputed to be worth
a great deal of money. John S. Murray
was In the employ of the Wakefleld Rat
tan Company and four years ago, after
about thirty years of service, he resigned
his position and opened an office of his
own In the Equitable building. Later he
became Interested with Alexander Hill in
the manufacture of mattresses, but was
not very successful. /
Mr. and Mrs. Murray made several
visits to Mrs. Townsend on the Pacnlc
Coast during: the past two or three years.
In January of last year Mr. Murray died
suddenly. Their daughter Mabel died
about six months ago.
When the Call correspondent called at
the home of Mrs. Ella N\ Quick. 219 Ber
gen street, Brooklyn, to-night, Mrs.
Quick was not aware that her sister,
Mrs. A. S. Townsend. was dead.
"Yes, my sister was Mrs. A. S. Town
send," she said, "and she has an only
child, Mrs. Ella F. Murray, widow or J.
F. Murray, late cashier of the Waketleld
Rattan Company. My niece. Mrs. Mur
rav, is a woman of about 45 years of aze.
weighing about HO pounds, short and full
habited, hair of auburn color, and always
well dressed. She visited me in Brook
lyn about three years ago. I understand
she is now irr San Francisco "
J. S. Quick, husband of Mrs. Ella Quick,
Fald later that his wife had three other
sistersâ Mra. Anna Foreholm of 639 Lex
ington avenue, corner Fifty-fourth street.
Manhattan; Mrs. Charles C. Bradford of
43 Chelsea street. East Boston, and Mrs.
Alonzo Qulmby of Chelmsford street, Lo
well, Mass. It was some months, he said,
since the family had heard from Mrs.
Townsend and from Mrs. Murray, her
daughter.
Mrs. Forsholm first learned of
her sister's death when The Call cor
respondent told her that Mrs. Ella Fran
ces Murray had laid claim to Mrs. Town
send's estate. When Mrs. '"orsholm ana
her daughters had recovt.^U from the
shock that followed the news. Mrs. For
sholm said that it was true that Mrs.
Murray was Mrs. Townsend's only child.
This was after Mr3. Forsholm said she
was loth to believe that her sister was
dead.
"It was onry this mornlns." she said,
"that I received from my brother-in-law,
Charles C. Bradford, of 43 Chelsea street.
East Boston. Mass., who hus charge -of
Mrs. Townsend's estate, a postal card
saying my sister had -written that tv.l.t
was there and stopping at a hotel. It was
also said that Mrs. Townsend or Mrs.
Murray, I could not tell which, was dis
pleased at the wny she had been treated
by her relatives."
Mrs. Murray lives at 2T Greenbrtar
street. Dorchester. Mass.. where her only
child. Mabel. 27 years old. died on April
30. Mrs. Murray left for San Francisco
about four weeks ago.
Mrs. Townsend was a Miss Coburn. her
family living In Lowell. Mas.". She has a
brother. Joseph, now living In San Fran
cisco, and a nephew, Ira W. Coburn, of
31$ Bush street, a prominent builder.
Mr. Bradford. In East Boston. ha3 seven
or eight bank books belonging to the dead
woman and all represent good sized depos
its'.
GENERAL WHXTAM B. SHATTER will act as hon
jj^Drary pallbearer at the funeral of Mrs. Townsend, which will
be held to-day from her late residence, 1221 California
street. General R. H. Warfleld will represent the National Guard,

and telegTams of condolence.
FUNERAL ARRANGEMENTS.
THE mystery following the sudden
death cf Mr?. Almira S. Townsend
Is be!r.ff dispelled, and while there
Is still much to explain evidence
that Mrs. Ella F. Murray, now in
pcfsession cf the Townsend home on Cal
ifornia street, is the daughter of the dead
Trocan is coming to the surface.
Thomas T. Towr.ser.d, the former hus
tzz.6. of the deceased, who says he is the
father of her only child, declares that
the lady calling- herself Ella F. Murray
Is Â¦what Biie represents herself to be, the
daughter of the dead philanthropist.
Dispatches from Mrs. Ella X. Quick of
i.13 Berlin etxeet, Brooklyn, and Mrs.
Ann* Forsholm cf â¬39 Lexington avenue.
New York, both sisters *>f the late Mrs.
Town&end. corroborate Mrs. Murray's
claim. The records in Dorchester show
that Miss Ella F. Townsend of Jjowell,
aged 22, and John S. Murray cf Dor
chester, aged 24, werd named at Dor
chester on September 7, 1S71, and that the
parents of Miss Townsend wero Thomas
T. Towr-send and Almira S. Townsend.
iluch of the mystery that originally at
ta*;heu itself to Mrs. Murray was of her
own making. She installed herself In the
dead woman's home behind barred an'l
bolted coors; she had this same home
g-jard^a by the police and refused ad
aiittance to ail who called to pay their iast
respects to the memory of the much es
teemed laiiy who had passed away. Mrs.
Hurray now explains this freely, giv
tog Information that she previously so
zc-aiouFly guarded. lure. Townsend's sud
oe- death was &. great shock to her. tslic

Larra-ssinent with n-Uccnce.
To-unsend. Adds to Mystery.
I>ut Just as soon as one mystery Is
apparently cleared up another one de
velops. New it is Townsend, whose identi
ty and whereabouts were revealei by The
K-2.il JÂ«Â«lÂ«n1ljr morning, who casts a mys
terious glamour over U-Efairs. The husband
oi the Â«2cu.d woman clothes his ut
terances in mystery. There is some
â¢â¢matter' that Mr. T^wnsc-nd has seen fit
to cons=u!t an aitornev ttbout, but what
tiiat rnitter is Townwnd wlM not etaie.
U the home of his present wife's sister,
Mrs. Matthews, 831 itne street, he last
;;:cx;t contented to see a representative
of The Oi.il. The old gentleman would not
?peai for himself, but a polished young
man, who Bald "Call me McGregor," gave
out a statement for publication.
â¢â¢Mr. Towrsend has been to see his at
toniev," said Air. TownffiiJn mouthpiece,
while" he v.ect through the process of
visaing his hands with invisible soap
iiiid water, "and he has placed the matter
ta fcis liiLZxds. Perhaps in two or three
<ia.ys he may consent and make the matter
public. Should he do so he will refer you
to his attorney, who may give you the
ii-.formatJon you desire."
V.Trat tike â¢"matter" was neither Town-
Fend nor the man who epoke for him
weald say. Only once did the first named
open his mouth and then it was to eay
tn*t KUa. V. Murray, now in possession
,-Â».! the Townsend home, was Â¦what she rep
resented herself to be â the daughter of
tiff .'-â¢-Â¦.- woman and himself.
Divorced Once Here.
Thomas T. Towr.s>en*i has been a resi
dent of this city since September 27. 1S76.
lie Is a. brother of William S. Townsend.
the candy man.
Brother Appears on Scene.
Since Ills residence here Townsend has
t>e<?3 once divorced and once maxrled. On
November 11, U0Q, Mrs. Almira S. Town
send was divorce-i from Thomas T. Town
eend. The decree was gmnted In the
Cambridge court and the jrround was de
sertion. On September Z~ Townsend came
to this city with a new wife, Mrs. Hen
rietta B. IL 7.Â»wn?end. to whom he had
bcÂ«en married in New York City on Jan
uary Â£3. lz~4. On ila.y 4. JSxO, in this city.
Sirs. Henrietta B. M. Tov.-nsend brought
suit for divorce from Thotnaj T. Town
tend on the ground of extreme cruelty.
In her complaint she set forth that on
I>ecembÂ«r 3. lt.73. in the Townsend candy
etore, 1152 Market street, the defendant
Strode plaintiff on the h<*ad. knocked her
down asd beat her so cruelly that marks
of 6tich treatment remained on her body
'or a long time. After the divorce from
Henrietta Townsend remained single until
January 2*- 1&3, when he married Miss
Josepiiine McGregor, his present wife.
The present residence of Townsend and
his wite is in a neat little three-room Hat
on Thirteenth and Noe streets.
The doors of the dead philanthropists'^
once hospitable home were ag~ain closed
vestcrdav to all who asked admittatnee.
bne of the visitors who was refused ad
mittance was Joseph Wilson Coburn. a
brother of the deceased. lie sent word to
airs, ilurray that her "Uncle Jo" wished
to see her. But to him, like to the other
callers, came back the stereotyped reply,
"Mrs. Murray regTets, but ehÂ» cannot
see anybody."
Coburn was rather disgruntled at being
refused admission to his dead sister's
home, and BOasbt the assistance of At
torney Hugo K. Asher. â¢who called on
Judge Bahrs and requested the court to
Issue an order compelling Mrs. Murray to
admit Coburn to the late home of the de
cea.sed that he might view the body. Mr.
Asher K ald that he represented Mr. Co
burn, who was desirous of viewing the
dead, but that Mrs. Murray had barred
the doors and stubbornly refused to ad
mit h!m. Judffe Uaiirs said that he did
not feel at liberty to make the order, but
was of opinion That the firm of Sullivan
& Sullivan, who represent Mrs. Murray,
could arrancre the matter amicably.
Judge Sullivan when appealed to in the
matter explained that It was Impossible
for Mrs. Murray to know whether Co
burn was what he represented himself to
be â the brother of her dead mother. Co
burn, however, received through Sullivan
an Invitation to attend the funeral of his;
F.lster, which takfs p!3ce this afternoon,
the hour not having been publicly an
nounced.
Coburn Is Puzzled.
v
Cotmrn could not understand why he
was denied admission to his dead sistf?r>
late home. Vhr-n seen last evening at
230S*Â£ Powell street, where he resides, he
ta5d:
"I cannot understand why Ella should
refuse to ellow me to view the remains of
ei?ter. ShÂ« knows very \rell who 1
%r.i. When she was 16 years eld I placed
Her in the Sisters of Mercy Convent in
the cJty of Xew Tork. There is no mys
tery ai>out the affair," concluded the old
4yfB&. EEXA F. MTTRILAY seems to have established her claim
JAfis daughter of Urs. Almira S. Townsend. Eastern dispatches
torroborate her claims to relationship to the "dead woman and
Thomas T. Townsend, the former husband of Urs. Townsend, ac
kno-cledg^s shÂ© -wus their daughter. Mr. Townsend, however, con
siders he has a grievance and has consulted his attorney, though
he refuses to make public his cause.
The house of death continued closed all day yesterday to rela
ti-res and friends alike- The many Eastern connections of the
dead philanthropist received the first news of her sudden demise
frcin The Call's correspondents.
Joseph Wilson Coburn, a brother of Urs. Townsend, -who has
been a resident of this city for some years, made his presence
known yesterday. He sent Mrs. Murray word that "Uncle Joe"
wished to see her, but was denied admittance.

Death. Claims Mrs. Corbett.
Mrs. Carrie Corbett, wife of the well
known sporting man Harry E. Corbett,
died last nierht at her home, 725 Hayes
street, after a Ions term of invalidism.
The news of Mrs. Corbett's death will
come as a shock to her many friends in
this dtV and the East. While Mrs. Cor
bett has been ailing- for some time, no im
molate danger was anticipated. When,
about a year ago, her health first began
to fail, she was tken East fn the hope
that the change of climate would prove
beneficial. It was found necessary, how
ever, for her to return to California,
where she had not been very long when
death came. The deceased was a native
of Massachusetts. She leaves one child,
a daughter.
Despite the valiant efforts put forth
by 10 o'clock the entire block in which
the fire started was reduced to ashes and
at this writing the power-house, which is
still useless so far as rendering assist
ance in the present distress is concerned,
is doomed. The losses so far are:

POLICEMEN SHOT BY
DESPERATE NEGROES
BUFFALO. July 24.-A fire which
started at midnight last night destroyed
the eastern elevator, which is situated on
tho Island opposite the foot of Washington
street. ThÂ»> elevator and its contents
were valued at $750,000 and were a total
loss.
Tho elevator was owned by the Amer
ican Linseed Oil Company, which came
into possession of the building only a few
weeks ugo. The oil works are situated
within 100 foot of the burned building.
Streams of water were played continuous
ly on the burning buildings and oil tanks
of the refinery. Fortunately the wind
was blowing In an opposite direction and
this fact probably prevented a far more
serious conflagration. The firÂ© was a dif
ficult one to light, as It started In the
upper part of tho elevator and gradually
burned downward until the entire build
ing was destroyed. The intense heat
made it imoossitMe for the firemen to en
ter the building and the streams thrown
up from the creek bolow had little effect
in checking the flames.
At 1:30 o'clock this morning it was be
lieved the lire was under control and
would be connned to the eastern elevator.
The cause of the lire Is not known.

John D. Lindsay Testifies
as to the Lax : Methods
in Vogue.
NEW YORK, July 24.â The hearing In
'Â¦ the case of i\ K. Neely wiuÂ» continued to
tiny with George Marshall of the financial
department Of Cuba on the witness stand.
United State? District Attorney Burnett
i of the prosecution paid particular atten-
Uon to the fact that the safe which con
taiticd whatever of the funds were In the
pofltbfflce had its outer door always
opened and that there was a general lax
r,e<=< about handling the funds. John D.
Lindsay, for the defense, brought out on
cross-examination th<? fact that the. em
ployes of the office all had access to the
safe, as well as the employes of tho
money order bureau, who kept their
motiey order blanks in the eaie. Several
employes had uecess to the safe: the
diH>r was mvvr locked, and tho money*
were placed In three drawers in plain
view and of easy access.
William Hoffman, assistant cashier of
the North American Trust Company, verl
l!ed various deposit* made with his com
pany by Mr. Neely. Major Eugene F.
SÂ«<i<i. the Treasurer of the island of Cuba.
t!;e next witness. veritK-d various deposits
mÂ»dtÂ» with him.
Colonel George H: Rurton, Inspector
General of Cuba, was recalled and asked
to explain fully half ins testimony given
yesterday concerning his inspection of the
postofflce nnance department to Cuba. In
an affidavit given In Cuba Colonel Hurton
told of a shortage in Mr. Neely's account
of about Jli>.iÂ«V. Colonel Hurton said on
the stand tiuit he reiterated that affidavit.
Judge I Â«a combe stopped him and said:
"1 don't care what testimony was given In
Cuba. It will not have the sllshtest
weight with n;e in deciding this case.
What must be done is to have competent
testimony given here. If It is proven
conclusively that money was rmbestled
ai:d stolen from the public funds in Cuba
I will decide to have the defendant sent
back to Cuba. What must be done Is to
have the competent testimony given here
and rot In Havana."
Colonel Hurton was then excused.
John C. N.ison, head of the detective
bureau of Rochester, who arrested Necly,
said that when searched. Neely had $t>502
in currency.
I.loyd Garrison, a New York lawyer, the
next witness, said he wns in Cuba, from
September to December SO, ISSS. when he
translated the Cuban pvnal code for the
Attorney General of the I'nited States,
nnd the translation In relation to em
borxlement by employes was discussed.
The discussion wns as to wlÂ»ether Mr.
Xeelv was an employe or a functionary.
Mr. Garrison considered him an employe.
The translation of the Cuban penal code
was then placed in evidence, -in spite of
the objection of Counselor Undsay for
the defense. The Government then rested
its case.

CHICAGO. July M.~Wllson & Marshall, the official archl- 1
tects of the National Grand Army encampment, which
will be held lure next month, have completed plans for
two arches and a court of honor, stretching from Jackson
boulevard to l'Hrk Row. Tills court of honor nnd the two
arches will cost 195,000. â¢
Michigan avenue will be transformed into a court of honor
A surpassing architectural beauty and grandeur. The general
sctaemd of the street Is to place a triumphal arch at Van Huren
sirect and one at Park How. connected by Corinthian columns
placed :it resnilar intervals on l>oth sides of the street, forming
i colonnade, broken only by the pylons that (lank each side of
the reviewing stand. The nrehes will span the entire street
it each end of the colonnade: one will be dedicated to the Grand
Army and one to the navy. In design they will be of the Cor
nthlan order, a prototype of the classics, but peculiarly adapted
;>>â¢ Hie designers to the uses of this work. Tlie material used In
:h< work on the exterior of the columns and arches will be of
-ijiff. representing marble In effect. The openings of the archea
through which the marching columns of the G. A. R. will pass
ire twenty feet wide and thirty feet high. The arches are dec
irnted with statuary and have relief panels In plaster, sym
mlizlng appropriately the different branches of the army and
invv. Richard W. Hech, sculptor, will execute the Pculptural
part of the work. The frieze of the arches will contain In relief
the names of some of the great grenerals of the army and noteil
admirals of the navy. The columns connecting the arches are
pure Corinthian shafts, decorated with shields clapping a group
of flaps and containing a large facsimile of the different army
and navy corps badges. The reviewing 1 stand will be flanked on
eiiher Fide with larpro four-column pylons decorated on the ton
with a large American eagle In plaster, resting or. an illumin
ated ball. The President's box and the balustrade guarding thÂ«
space reserved for distinRulshed guests will be decorated with
staff in rich design.
The Illumination of the court of honor will be a feature In
Itself, and will be treated differently from that which has us
unlly been done in this line. It is not the intention of the de
sipners to have a preat glare of light on the arches and columns
from electric lamps set In lines and angles, which always de
stroy the architectural forms of work of this kind, but on the
other hand, the lights will be placed in such a way that they
will simply highlight the statuary and architectural features of
the arches and give them added artistic effect and a new beauty
for night view, even beyond that of daylight. Searchlights will
a!?o be placed on top of the arches at each end of the colonnade,
which will Rive beautiful effects when the powerful light is
thrown down through this court of honor, bringing out in high
relief its classic outlines and monumental proportions.

SANTA ROSA, July 24.â J. E. Klnfr.
who shot and killed pioneer II. S.
Church at the latter'* home In
Two Rock Valley, Marin County,
is fleeing from the officers of the
law, and so far has eluded the
Sheriffs of two counties.
The crime was committed just over the
line in Marin County, and though Sheriff
Grace and hii deputies have been doing
tht-ir best to apprehend the fugitive ar.d
Sheriff Taylor has been scouring the coun
ty, up to a late hour to-night their ef
forts had proved futile. from Sheriff
Taylor, who was Jn town this afternoon,
it v.rÂ»Â« learned that King's trail was struck
yesterday a short distance this side of
the scene of the shooting. King, who is
afoot and has a lame leg, apparently had
made slow progress, but, according to
Taylor's statement, who traced him to
the e<lge of this city, the slayer succeeded
in covering up his trail. The officers are
confident that they will soon have their
man. Sheriff Taylor has Issued descrip
tive circulars offering a. reward for King's
capture.
Mrs. King, the wife of the fugitive, is
now in this city, where she drove at once
after the shooting. When seen to-night
at the Eagle Hotel she gave the following
version ot the shooting:
Mrs. King's Version of the Shooting.
"My husband and I camped on the
county ruad just outside of the ranch
where Mr. Stice lives. The ranch belonged
to Mr. Church, but was not his home, that
being about a half mile away. Mr. St'.ce
Is t_nurch's son-in-law. "We came into
camp Sunday and then took our horses,
tour In number, inside of the fence to
on<- of the wells for water. The well had
evidently been in disuse for some time
aS we found the water dirty and unfit tor
the horses to drink. We therefore took
the horsÂ»*s to the barn and there w.uered
them. Nothing unpleasant happened at
that time, but in>' husband had some bus
iness transactions with Mr. Stice relative
to exchanging a horse for a cow. Monday
morning we again took the horses to the
burn for w^ter and with the intent of
cloFing the deal. My husband left me
with three of the horses while he took
the fourth within.
â¢â¢While he was there Mr. Stlce came
down to the barn and greeted him with
the remark: 'Well, you have got a gall
to take your horses to my trough^ when
you know we are short of water.' Mr.
King: replied that he did not know any
thing about a shortage of water, and that
he would not stay to water the other three
horses. Mr. Stice replied with an oath
about the one already watered and we
wont back to our camp, intending to bo
further to a better camping spot, where
we might obtain water. After the words
we thought that Mr. Stlce would not want
to trade the cow for our horpe. We had
not been In camp Ions when we saw Mr.
Church and Mr. Stico coming- toward us.
The latter had a hammer a,nd nails and
together they boarded up the old well near
the fence. My husband was sitting: on
the foot of our cot at the time and be
hind him lay the loaded rifle. 1 was sit
ting on n box near by. No words passed
between the two men and ourselves dur
ing the nailing up of the well, but when
the operations were completed they came
out on the road toward us.
Shooting of Church.
"Mr. Church uttored a terrible oath and
told us to keep off his place in the future
nnd let hla water alone. My husband re
plied we were not on his place; that we
were <m the county road; and that we did
not want his water. With this Church
uttered another oath, calling- my husband
the worst name that one man can call
another. When he came toward us he
ijut hlrf hand tn his pocket, as if for a
knife or pistol, and my husband grabbed
the pun and shot. Had it not been for
the terrible name and the nearness of the
wfujiOM to him. I know he would r.ot
have done it. Church was in a terrible
tamper and was within about twenty
hN*i>m of uÂ« when the shot was fired. I
estimate the distance from what they tell
rne. I do not know he was c!c*? ii?on
uÂ». When the shot was tired, he turned
ond ran n few steps toward the house
before he fell Slice ran also, but can*
bach when hlÂ» father-tn-law fell.
"My ht]Â«b.-Â»rul and I ran to the injured
man and attempted to pick htm up. but
Ht!<**! llftf-d him and carried him to thÂ«
hOU*e, while we made preparations tor
our departure. We left everything but
oTir bisggy and horses. I drove one horse
and my husband rode a second. A third;
followed, hut the fourth would r.ot come.
DO we left hini. When we passed the
boom Mrs. Stice came running out ar.d
to!') m- to hurry on toward safety *i tv>s

SANTA CRUZ BOY
WANTED BLOOD
cjpP LAMEDA, July 24.â Armed

Life on the farm became distaste
ful to GeorgJe. His father runs a
dairy seven miles from nowhere in
the Santa Cruz Mountains and he
did not take to the daily drudgery
of delivering milk, cleaning cans,
etc. So he sold his father's favor
ite horse and devoted the proceeds
to the purchase of an arsenal for
himself and a friend, who was In
duced to follow his lead. The boys
stole a ride on a freight train, but
when they got to Los Gatos the
other boy left Georgrle to g-o It alone.
When Georgie reached Alameda he
was surprised at his reception by
the police. His father had notified
the Sheriffs of seven counties that
he wanted his son. The boy's quest
for sore had been inspired by a too
close application to the pages of
yellow literature.

on Delmas avenue, met with a serious
accident while out riding on the alameda

About 1 a. m. a team drove up in front
of the saloon and two masked men got
out. while a third remained In the car
riage. The men were evidently acquaint
ed with the surroundings, for they made
straight for a back room, where the gam
bling was going on. The players were
taken completely by surprise. Both rob
bers held revolvers, and they had no trou

their hands. The earr.ings of the bank,
amounting to $700. were seized, besides
about $io which was taken from the play
ers' pockets.
After warning the gang that the first
man who made an outcry would be shot,
the robbers made a hasty exit, jumping
into their vehicle and speeding away in
the darkness. It is thought that the rob

This claim is corroborated by the fact
that Mrs. Slovinski received $1500 through

CONVENTION OF CHRISTIAN
CHURCHES AT THE SEA
PROFESSOR CARL COPPING
PLEKN of the University of Cal
ifornia has been appointed super-
Visor of the census of the Philip
pine Islands. The appointment comes di
rectly from President Taft of the Philip
pine Commission, with the approval of
Superintendent M.erriam of the United
States census.
The Regents of the University yester
day granted Professor Plehn a year's
leave of absence from his duties as as
sociate professor of linance, and he will
at once cable his acceptance to President
Taft_ As soon as he can arrange matters
of business here. .Professor Plehn will
leave with his wife for Manila.
Tho taking of the census of the Philip
pine Islands will be a most difficult
undertaking, and the appointment of
Professor Plehn to supervise it is a trib
ute to his recognized ability as a statis
tician and to hi? success as supervisor of
census for this district.
Durinp their two centtiriPs of occupa
tion of the Philippines, the Spanish never
attempted anything like a systematic
census. The difficulty of the undertaking
will be appreciated when it is remem
bered that there are eighty different
tribes in the islands, each speaking its
own language, and many of tfiem savage
and suspicious cf any sort of enumer
ation. It will be Professor Plehn's duty
to plan the methods of securing the de
hired information as to population, indus
tries and resources; appoint supervisors
of tho districts and enumerators who
understand the language of the tribe to
be enumerated, and to supervise the col
lection of statistics. The tabulation will
be dono in this country.
Professor Plehn is a graduate of Brown
University. His "Introduction to Pub
lic Finance"! is used as a text book in
all thf- leaning universities in the country.
He demonstrated his fitness to solve dif
ficult problems in census work by his
succrss with the Chinatown enumeration,
in spite of 'lifflculties arising through the
plague quarantine. He devised a calen
dar for ascertaining the birth of Chlneso
In western chronology which proved so
ingenious and useful that it was adopted
by the census authorities for use
throughout the country.
The preliminary examination of the boy
was held to-day and he was committed
for manslaughter.
The boy went Into his brother's room,
climbed over the bed, got the gun and,
pointing It at the Chinaman, snapped it.
It missed lire. He aimed again and pulled
the trig-gcr. The cartridge exploded this
time, the bullet sped to Its mark and the
Chinaman fell face forward on the floor
and died in a few minutes. Then the boy
replaced the gun. After this the youthful
murderer went out of the back door and
down the street to where a house was be
ing removed, where he nonchalantly
watched the men at work.
The story of the murder as obtained
from the lad was that there had been a
disagreement between him and the China
man. The deceased had laughed at him,
whereupon the young lad avered he would
shoot him. This caused the Chinaman to
laugh again.
VANCOUVER. B. C, July 24.-Mah Lin,
the Chinese cook of Mr. Chenoweth of
Rossland. was found dead In the kitchen
of the Chenov.-eth house on the morning
of May 23 with a gunshot wound In his
head, and the manner of his death has
just been discovered. Ernest, the 8-year
old son of Mrs. Chenoweth, shot the Chi
naman because he had teased him by
laughing at him. This Is the gist of a
confession made by the boy to Assistant
Superintendent P. K. Ahcarn of the Plnk
erton agency of Seattle, who had been,
engaged by the Chinese and the local
peace officer, John Raymer.

The Japanese, vrhj outnumber by three

*The strikers thereafter stood around the
wharves bitterly denouncing the authori
ties who had soldiers there to protect the
Japanese and *weaxiryr vengeance oa the
latter.
Ai the union meeting held this morn
ing. Vice President Kogers, who Is now
out on ball, having been arrested on a
charge ol intimidation, urged his men
to t2_ke no hasty action. He said he did
not think that the soldiers would obey
c command to fire. They were all labor
ing men like the fishermen, he Eaid^ and
would lav down their arms in the orticers'
xaees rather than taice any action. Reso
lutions were then passed confirming tha
t:and to work for twenty-five cents only,
axd never to accept twenty cents, like
th.e Japanese.
â¢ Tne Indians ara also holding out and
are threatening to leave for cone and
cesert the river for good. The white men
gay this afternoon thev war also leave

whites.
Vhe Japanese had their plans splendidly
organized. They paid attention to noth
ing Nut their work of preparing to em
bark at S o'clock. At ten minutes to 8
r.ot three boats were en the river. Just
at S o'clock they begran to pull out. Five
minutes later the river was white with
-die sails of a thousand boats and in a fine
breoze they pushed out to sfa. Their ser
ried ranks were bo compact that one
couid not have seen a steamer approach
hxg. TJiere was one long wall of canvas
and twenty steamers could not have
etopped their pcing out. The fifteen hun
6r*d boats started out under the pro

Tiiitnen were formed in lir.e around the
wharves, ar.d with loaded rifles warned
1 r,< k the GU strikers who had hitherto
prevented ar:y fisherman this season from
plrins his calling on the Fraser.
The Japanese will be fishing all night.
Th*> strikers threaten that when the

Worsnop does r.ot believe they will dare

THE SUMMER'S FIRES.
ONE would suppose that after the wide publicity
given to the damage done by summer fires in
our mountain forests some extra care would
be taken by people who resort to the mountains to
prevent fire.
That this is not the case, however, is shown by the
unusual prevalence of forest fires. In El Dorado
County a large sugar pine region is being shaven
bare by the flames. The finely timbered country' be
tween the forks of the American River is all on fire,
and higher up in the Sierras the conflagrations are
numerous and widespread. As for the origin of these
conflagrations, exact knowledge is difficult. The fool
who starts a fire by carelessness doesn't know what he
has done, and the scoundrel who does it viciously is
too smart to talk about it.
If fools and fire could be separated very much harm
would be avoided. The summer fool usually goes to
the mountains in the society of a cigarette, and casts
the noisome remains of his companion in the dry
grass, where it is almost sure to start a fire. If the
summer fool have a pipe for company he is usually
so absorbed in getting it lighted properly that he
throws the still burning match into the grass and goes
on his way puffing his tobacco and leaving destruc
tion, danger and may be death behind him. One fool
of this sort was recently observed by some children
in starting a fire in that way. Experience had taught
them the awful consequences that would follow, and
they bravely attacked the fire and extinguished it
after a hard battle, while the hulking fool who had
committed a felony walked off unconcerned. Several
Winchesters in that neighborhood were soon brought
out, and if be bad been found he would have been
taught that life and pioperty arc not to be destroyed
by being too lazy or too indifferent to extinguish the
fire on a match before casting it away.
Some more agitation of this snbiect, that will teach
l>eople the law in the case, will result in the capture
of a few of these fools and sending them to prison.
The crime h arson of the vilest kind and should be
punished with the greatest severity. The element of
malice is presumed in their case, and when they shed
fire in tbe dry season where it is sure to cause a con
flagration there should be no attention paid to the
plea that they did not mean to do harm.
Everybody in Califorrjia is interested in preventing
I forest fires and in punishing those who start them.
j The Hc?truction of the forests is greater every year
! instead of less. Last year the main, fires did not
start until September. This year they were well un
der way by the last of June, and July has witnessed
the origin and ravages of a score of fresh ones. In
! our cities we maintain a costly Fire Department to
! extinguish fires and. a police to detect their begin
ning. Yet if all combustible property in the cities of
California were to burn, the loss would not equal
that wrought in one summer by forest fires. The ac
j tual destruction of merchantable timber is appalling,
hut every acre burned over in the mountains lessons
the fertility of an acre in the valleys. When the moun
tain forests are finally extirpated the fruitfulness of
our valleys will disappear.
The wealth of California lies in the operation of
two natural -laws, evaporation and gravity. With
the equilibrium of nature left undisturbed their
operation is beneficent. The moisture that rises
by evaporation is transported to the mountains and
J precipitated, and gravity transports it back to the

bano, Italy. To ascertain the names and
number of men in the Union and Confed
erate service who bore the title of gen
eral in conjunction with the prefix of ma
jor, brigadier and the like would require
a search of the war records of each army,
and to ascertain how many of these died
from the effect of wounds received dur
ing the- war would require a further
search that no one would undertake.
ETIQUETTE OF DRIVINGâ H. A.,
Menlo Park, Cal. The rule of etiquette j
in driving horses does not require a per
son to perform an impossibility. For in
stance if a gentleman is driving a horse
or pair that require him to hold rein3
and whip at the same time, and while
doing this there comes up from the oppo
site direction a carriage in which there
Is a lady of his acquaintance, he need not
raise his hat. A plgasant smile is all that
is requisite. He is not required to take
chances with the horse or team he Is
driving in order to show his politeness.
PEAT AND TURFâ W. S. S., City. The
difference between peat and turf is thus
explained by Professor Silliman: "In
many northern countries the vegetation
of mosses, ferns, sedges, confervae.
rushes, reeds and many small plants accu
mulate in morasses, swamps and low
places, each winter adding its quota to
the mass of decomposing vegetable mat
ter. In its turn making the soil of a new
vegetation in the ensuing spring. Thus,
considerable accumulations aro formed in
process of time, the lower portions of
which are black, unctuous and somewhat
dense and are called peat, while the upper
layers are spongy, fibrous and less per
fectly decomposed and are called turf." _

THE DUTY OF REPUBLICANS.
CHINESE women are probably the most industrious or
Oriental women. Even the women with little feet employ
themselves In various ways. They do needlework, work
for the temples and make paper flowers, which they are
fond of wearing in their hair. It is not unusual to see a woman
up to her knees In mud wearing most elaborate head dec
orations. For the temples they make incense sticks, print Clptn
and paper for the dead and make dead men's money. The lat
ter is made of yellow paper cut in slits, and has gold or silver
foil pasted on one side. This they believe to be current In the
other world. Besides this, they print pictures of clothing, furni
ture and articles of general utility upon cloth or paper with
v.ooden stamps. These are burned at the grave.
The "kitchen god," which is found in the kitchen of
every house, is elaborate according to the means of the pro
prietor, and this, too, is made by the women. It is a banner
like affair, made of paper, and may have, if the family whom it
is to protect is poor, only the name of the god written upon it. |
Oi it may resemble somewhat the old picture medleys which |
were made of advertising cards. In the latter case it is covered j
with representations of vases of flowers and domestic animals j
cut out of red paper and pasted ingeniously together. Even' j
New Year's day this is burned, and ascends in flame as an of
fering to the "upper ruler," and a new god must be ready to
take its place. If evil words are said before the kitchen god
he will make a bad report, and evil will descend upon the
household.
Filial piety is the great virtue of China and disrespect to
ward parents or those who are older is a crime. Older brothers
and sisters are always addressed as "older brother," "older sis
ter," and a measure of respect is shown by brothers to sisters
who are their seniors. At table guests are always seated ac
cording to their ages, -and the second question of courtesy is
always, "What Is your'honorable age?" The first is. "Have you
eaten rice?" This is equivalent to our "How do you do?"
/ Obedience to parents is demanded by the civil law. and dis
obedience is punishable by arrest and imprisonment.
When I was in Peking a few years ago my attention was
called to the loopholes that perforate the wall of the city, and
I noticed in one place that there were three of these quite close
together which were closed. The reason for the closing of these
and a few others that I discovered was explained to me as
follows: Parricide Is in China the greatest of crimes, and when
such a deed is perpetrated the murderer Is killed, his house is |
razed to the ground and the dirt under it dug up. In addition
to this, in Peking the loophole in the wall facing the district
in which the crime was committed is closed as a perpetual
testimony against that section, while the prefect of the city
and at times the Governor of the province are in danger of
degradation from office for lax rule. Although this is an ancient
custom in Peking, Xhe number of closed loopholes is not great.
The Chinese wall is a favorite promenade for foreigners.
From it may be seen the yellow tiled roofs of the palaces and

plain, bounded by hills.
There Is no pleasure to be derived from riding In Peking. I
took eight drives in a Peking cart, and live to tell the tale,
but It took every minute of my Intention to "keep all my Joints
from dislocating simultaneously. The carts have two wheel3

They are drawn by donkeys or mules.
Manchu -women wear their hair In a broad, stiff bowknot.
which distinguishes them from the Chinese women. The Man
chus have never bound their feet. Footbinding has received
it3 death blow, and heathen officials are memorializing the Gov
ernment to abolish the practice. The queue which is worn b>
them is a badge of loyalty to the Tartar Government.
The standard book of etiquette In China was written by
Lady Cho twenty-seven hundred year3 ago. Lady Cho was the
widow of a distinguished literary man of North China, and
after his death was faithful to his memory. Her husbands
brother was historian of that dynasty, but v.'hen his work was
half completed he lost his sight. The Emperor sent a messen
ger to him, asking who could finish the book, and the reply
was returned that only his brother's wife was capable of do
ing it. The Emperor sent for Lady Cho, and she was con
ducted in the greatest of state to the Emperor's palace. TherÂ«
she completed her brother-in-law's work so satisfactorily that
it is impossible to tell where the man left off and the woman
began. Lady Cho afterward wrote "Instruction for Women and
Girls," which has even yet no rival. In the book she gave the
duty of women from birth to death. There are chapters on
"Instruction of Children by Mothers," "Duty of Daughters to
Parents." "Duty of Children to Teachers," "Filial Piety,"
"Hospitality, and How to Receive "Women Guests." and direc
tions for caring for clothing, how to put it away at various
seasons, how to prepare their husbands' food, reverencing their
husbands, and reverencing their mothers-in-law.
In the chapter on virtue is this terse advice: "If your
parents are gick, loosen not your girdle to He down; ajcsd if
they die, your very bones should bleed."
Regarding hospitality this ancient writer says: "As a guest,
demand nothing. As hostess, exhaust hospitality."
An exhortation for women not to yield to laziness la par
ticularly clever, and refers to the effort that a woman with
a torn garment makes to hide the rents. In these words: "A
lazy woman Is always ragged. She is forever pulling the west
over to hide, the east."
The last chapter ends with this wail: "All that are born
must die."
Regarding the capacity of Chinese women as scholars. I
have found them eager for Instruction. The same spirit that
makes the Chinaman's highest ambition to have a literary son
causes him to take kindly to the educating of hi3 daughters,
and no jealousy has so far been shown by the men lest the
women usurp their positions.
THE FIGHT FOR THE HOUSE.
CHAIRMAN BABCOCK of the Republican
Congressional Campaign Committee has once
more given warning to the party of the danger
that the various elements of opposition to the admin
istration may carry so many Congressional districts
as to give them control of the House of Representa
tives. Such success on the par,t of the malcontents
would prevent the enactment of many important
measures that are expected of the next Congress, and
thereby seriously interfere with the progressive wel
fare of the country.
In describing the situation Mr. Babcock, after
pointing out that in the Southern States the Bryanites
have 120 Congressmen sure, and that almost every
State that gives its electoral vote for Bryan will send
a solid Bryan delegation to the House, went on to
say: "For our part, the States which will give their
electoral votes to the Republicans will at the same
time have 40 per cent of their Congressional delega
tions Democratic. Just look at the Democratic rep
resentation in this Congress from New York, Penn
sylvania, New Jersey and other strongholds of Repub
licanism on national issues. â¢ The election of Repub
lican electors from the State of New York is not
going to pull through the Republican representative;
from New York City districts. West of the Missouri
River we will have to fight to hold what we already
have. In the Northwest there are some districts
which are too close in their pluralities to be com
fortable. That will push us into New York, Penn
sylvania and Massachusetts to make gains to offset
almost certain losses in some Middle West districts.
The fight will come to a point where every vote will
count."
These statements must not be looked upon as a
mere campaign exaggeration designed to rouse po
litical ardor. They are fully justified by the facts.
The Call has once or twice had occasion to direct at
tention to a movement among Gold Democratic
papers in the East to support Democratic candidates
for Congress while opposing Bryan. It is therefore
certain that in many Congressional districts the vote
for the Bryanite candidate for Representative will be
larger than theA-ote for Bryan himself. The old
dyed-in-the-wool free traders have accepted the
Presidency of McKinley solely because they had no
other recourse against Bryanism, but they will be
very willing to handicap his administration by the
election of a Democratic House, and doubtless a good
many of them will seek to do so, in accordance with
the counsel of their Eastern organs.
In the face of such an emergency a grave respon
sibility rests upon the Republicans of every State
where there is a single Congressional district in
doubt. The margin of Republican control in the
present Congress is so small that the Bryanites will
have to gain very few seats to overthrow it. There
is therefore not a district in which the party can af
ford to take chances.
To Californians the lessons of the situation are
of particular importance. There is not an absolutely
sure district in the State. There is not one in which
a faction fight or any just ground for dissatisfaction
among the rank and file of the voters would not be
dangerous. At the conventions, therefore, the great
est care must be exercised to eliminate anything like
boss domination or unfairness in the selection of can
didates. As Chairman Babcock has said, "the fight
will come to a point where every vote will count."
There are so many good Republicans in the dis
tricts where Dibble and Wolfe are seeking nomina
tion that there is no reason in the world why the
party should take the risk of trying a yellow dog can
didate on the voters.

AT Jast it seems as though the Cuban revolution
is about to produce the fruit for which it be
gan and continued up to our intervention.
CUBA LIBRE.
The people are to vote for a constitutional coix
\ention, which is to formulate a fundamental law.
When this has been adopted the form of government
for which it provides will be Instituted, and Cuba
libre will cease to be a dream and become a fact. The
absolute independence of Cuba, unlimited except by
her hemispherical position, will be no less gratifying
to her people who fought for that result than to those
citizens of the United States who feel keenly that the
honor of this country is involved in keeping its pledge
made in the declaration of war against Spain.
But such citizens of the United States must not for
get that there is only one kind of independence.
There is no qualified kind. Our forefathers, in the
pinch of our revolutionary war, made a treaty with
France which made her suzerain to us. In that con
vention we agreed to make no foreign treaty with
out her consent. After that agreement was made, in
1778, France came to our assistance against England
and the purpose of our revolution was accomplished
by her help. When we entered upon our experi
mental independence, however, we discovered that we
were not independent, but that the treaty of 1778 was
a limitation incompatible with that perfect freedom
which was the purpose of our revolt. Accordingly
we immediately proceeded to violate our treaty with
France, and assumed the risk of war with our ally
and benefactor.
Now, notwithstanding this chapter in our own his
tory, the statement is made that our Congress will re
vise and amend the Cuban constitution. before it be
comes operative, and that Congress will forbid Cuba
to make any treaty without our consent, and that
Cuba libre shall not have even the poor privilege of
going into debt unless we permit it!
Against this proposed programme we protest. It
is not keeping even the letter of our pledge. If the
Cubans are incapable of judging how far to pledge
their credit, they are not fit to be free from Spain.
If they are not fit to assume and discharge interna
tional obligations they are not fit for that indepen
dence which we declared they had of right.
stitution than has the Spanish Cortes
This programme is full of the .seeds of future
trouble. It makes us suzerain of Cuba. It exceeds
the Monroe doctrine, and goes beyond anything ever
intended or attempted by any Government in this
hemisphere. Cuba should be left independent in fact,
with no further limitation than is upon every Govern
ment in the Monroe hemisphere. Her membership in
the Monroe family of nations should be the sole re
striction upon her international relations, and that
runs only against her right to sell herself to a foreign
monarchy. As far as the pledging of her credit goes,
the highest function of a free government is the unre
stricted control of its own fiscal. Unless it can
control the care of its own credit, its people are de
prived of the most important part of their schooling
in independence. Again, the American Congress has
no more right to revise and amend the Cuban con-
The people of the United States are not anxious
to lay up trouble in Cuba of exactly the same kind
that England found in the Transvaal. The suzerain
function is not compatible with republican institu
tions, and we have a full suit of functions on hand
at present and need no additions.
ocean, enabling it to perform many useful offices on
the way. The forest floor holds it back so that it is
distributed, a proper proportion entering the soil to
fill the deep springs, and the rest finding its way into
the surface channels, where it furnishes power, per
forms irrigation and benefits man in many ways.
When the fool and his fire come along and burn
the forest off. evaporation and gravity become the
scourges of man. The streams no longer have a
steady and uniform flow, but are torrential when the
rain falls and dry at other times. The forest floor
being destroyed, the water does not penetrate the soil,
and the deep springs cease to be affluent. Aridity
j increases, fertility declines, and the cities may as well
burn, for that which supported them has been de
stroyed. It may be said with safety that no expense

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JULY 25, 1900
The powers are not yet certain whether to call the
Chinese outbreak war or anarchy, but they are fairly
certain they cannot call it off. *
The Republican Business Men's Club will not be
true to its name unless it does business as well as
talk it
6
BY the organization of a political duo tne i\e
pubhean business men of the city have done |
v. oil. They have taken the first step in a move
ment of great importance to die party and to the city.
That stop, however, will be of Little value unless it
be pron:pt]y followed by others in the same direction.
Organization alone cannot achieve much. To defeat
the schemes of the railroad and the Mint saloon bosses
there i? needed on the part of business men and other
good citizens an active participation in the campaign
irom this time on.
An organization s;:ch as the Republican Business
Men's Qab can easily exert a wide and potent in
fluence among the better elements of the Republican
party. It can render great service by inducing
good men to join I^eprbiican district clubs and to
take a prominent part in their work. That service
hhnuM be carntsiiy and energetically performed. The
time is approaching for the election of delegates to
the county convention, and the bosses have long since
Said plans to elect ?.< many as possible, so that they
may control the nomination of candidates, or at least
be able to force concessions with regard to some of
them. Against the bosses the better elements oi the
party mnst array themselves, sooner or later, and the
sooner the better.
[n the resolutions adopted at the time of organi
ration the Republican business men, after demanding
the nomination of worthy candidates for all offices,
and especially for Superior Judges and members of
the Legislature, declared: "If such nominations are
ir.adc for the bench and the Legislature, we pledge
them our active support." That is very good, but
that i> not enough. The members of the club should
exert all their power to see to it that such nomina
tions are made. A earning against bad nominations
is not half *o effective as work lor goo/1 ones.
The campaign begins with the approaching pri
maries. Let the business men join the Republican
clubs in their districts and get their friends to join.
Let them make every effort to nominate strong.
clean, honest men as candidates for the convention.
If in any -district the bosses get control of the club
and nominate a ticket of unworthy men, then in that
district the better elements of the party should put
into the field an opposition ticket and take an appeal
to the voters at the primary. In short, the fight
against the bosses and their gangs should begin in
the district clubs and be continued at every point of
the campaign thereafter. From start to finish there
should be no hesitation, no Jet up or compromise,
and the finish should see the Kelly and Crimmins
combine crushed, routed and driven out of the Re
j;t'bncan party.
The business men arc undoubtedly right in de
claring th^t the success of the Republican party "can
only be obtained by roininatir.p: persons for office
who will command the confidence of the voters."
The experience of the paÂ«t has proven that beyond
a doubt. The da\' when Republicans would tolerate
"yellow dog"' tickets in their party has gone by. If
there is to be discreditable men in office Republicans
prefer to have the odium of such - men rest upon
Democracy, and consequently will let elections go by
default rather than support unworthy men. That les
fem has been given many times of late, and the busi
ness men should now apply it to the issues before us.
Let them not only, demand jrood nominations, but
jret out. work for them and make sure of them.
When we have opened the door of China by knock
ing it off its hinges there will then be an easy way
for the Chinese. to get any amount of European and
American arms and weapons for the v purpose of
waking things deadly to ail who undertake to go in.
Forest fires are now blazing first in one part of the
State and then in another. They appear to be able
to illuminate even-thing except the intellects of the
Silurian objectors to forcstrv laws.

Should a Russian army succeed in getting to Peking
the Czar will be in a humor to call another peace con
ference and propose that there be no more fighting
and that even- one keep what he has..

By Chase A- MFridrr.ha'.lâ Thursday. July IR. at 11 o'clock,
Tr;-tu;:K arid \Vo:k H<-rsÂ»-g. at "3: Vi.ik-t i-'.r^t.Our bay cities are already favored
rather above the average of large com
munities for cheap and attractive subur
ban outings, but now another has been
fixed upon, outstripping all the rest, per
haps, in distinguishing features and rare
Interest.
The managements of the Mt. Hamilton
Stage Co. and the Hotel Vendome of San
Jose have put on sale at the railroad of
fices a round-trip ticket to Lick Observa
tory, covering every expense, and many
cle!i{?htful privileges, for ?S. about one
third less than the regular cost.
This will be a Saturday and Sunday
ticket, including rail and stage transpor
tation both -ways from San Francisco,
Oakland or Alameda. and a day and a
quarter at the splendid Hotel Vendome in
San Jose. It provide? also for a night
visit to the Uck Observatory and a
glimpse at the worlds and wonders be
yond through the great telescope.
Another ticket is what is known as an
open rate, for $S "A good any day. Includ
ing the same privileges, with a half day
lor.ger at the Vendome. but a day in
stead of night virit at the observatory.
Our great stellar spyglass is justly "fam
ous and Mt. Hamilton shares the honors,
even though It does not rival Matterhorn
or Blanc, or similar Alpine crags. It nev
ertheless has a grandeur all its own, and
It is doubtful if any of the world's noted
piles afford more supremely pleasing vis
tas. The trouble with most of us is that
we live too near. If we lived In Xew York
or Europe ir.strad of under its very
shadow it would have far greater interest
for us. and it should no Ioneer be to our
credit, in view of this very tempting of
fer, that we do not go and see it now.

FOUND SAFETY PIN
LODGED IN NECK OF
A FOUR-YEAR OLD BOY
JOHN and Amelia Cecoria
of 521 Green street recently
. quarreled over their four-year
old son. The child had some
thing- the matter with Its
throat and the mother said it re
quired a surgeon's attention. The
father objected and the quarrel
grew so bitter that the husband
and wife separated.
Mrs. Cecoria took the child to a
free medical clinic and tha sur
geons, by use of the X-ray, found
a large open safety pin in Its neck.
An operation was performed and
the pin removed. The child had
evidently partially swallowed tha
pin, which had lodged In the throat
and worked into the neck, the point
having almost reached the surface.
The Society, for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children is investig-ating
the father's action in refusing to
let a. surgeon examine the child and
later failing to contribute to the lit
tle one's support.

I NINTH DAY SEARCH FOR
BODIES IS FRUITLESS
j Launches Patrol Marin "Waters for
Trace of Kelly or Miss
Warren.
Yesterday, the ninth day since Miss
Bessie Warren and Tobias J. Kelly disap
peared in a boat from Belvedere and were
supposedly drowned in Raccoon Straits,
launches patrolled the bay from early
I morning till late last night. The efforts
j of the searchers were uncrowned with
success, however.
The gasoline launch Norwood, with Fred
Lewis and John Kelly, brother of the
missing mm, on board, cruised around
Red Rock and the Marin Islands, while
Kelly scanned every inch of the water's
surface with powerful field glasses. The
McN'eill patrolled Racccon Straits and the
vicinity of Ang-el IslSnd, the same sieans
being user! on her as on the Xorwold for
the detection of any floating objects. Sev
! eral times the launches approached what
j was apparently a body, only to discover
on a nearer view that the object was only
a floating bunch of seaweed or some other
flotsam. It is now said to be improbable
that the bodies will ever be found. Old
timers declare that the remains of the un
fortunate young couple lie with their boat
In some cavernous hole at the bottom of
Raccoon Straits. To-day and to-morrow
a sharp lookout will be kept for anv trace
of the victims of the recent Belvedere

MARKET-STREET
COMPANY SHOWS
GREAT ACTIVITY
There are some peculiar complication 1 ?
in connection with the affairs of the
steamer Charles D. Lane, and Just where
the matter will end no one seems to know.
She is to sail to-day for Nome, but some
of her creditors jnay step in and make
trouble by holding the vessel! A meeting
of the shareholders in the Wild Goose
Mining and Trading Company was held in
the Hobart building yesterday, which
lasted for nearly three hours. Some ar
rangement was reached and the vessel
will probably get away to-day, but if she
does there will be more trouble at Seattle,
as a number of bills contracted by the
vessel on. her last visit to the Sound are
still unpaid. R. Lewis, tho attorney from
Seattle, is in San Francisco in connection
with this matter, and the chances are
that all may be straightened out and the
vessel reach Nome without any libels
being placed against her.
Whin the Charles D. Lane does reach
Nome tht-re will be some more straighten
ing out of affairs, and Captain \\ arner
may lose his ship. Captain Phil Cook,
once of the steam whaler Thrasher, but
more lately of Lane'3 schooner Vega, is
here, ready to take the steamer, but
Captain Warner refuses to give her up.
He has cleared her and intends to hold
his command until released by Charles
D. Lane himself.
When the Charles D. Lane was last at
Nome the managing owner gave Captain
Warner instructions to sail on a certain
Thursday at noon. He then went to
Golovnin Bay and left his son Louis in
charge of affairs. Louis Lane took Cap
tain Cook out of the Vega and told him
to take command of the steamer. At the
same time he told Captain Warner not
to sail until instructions were sent out
from the shore. Cook sent his belongings
aboard and was all ready to take com
mand and leave for San Francisco on
Friday. His plans and those of young
Louis" Lane wore spoiled, however, as
Captain Warner took the ship to sea on
th? day and hour designated by Charles
D. Larie.
Cook followed his clothes to San Fran
cisco on a revenue cutter and is now mak
ing a fight for the command of the Charles
D. Lane. He and Captain Warner were
before the directors of the Wild Goose
Mining and Trading Company, but it haÂ«
not yet been decided who will take the
steamer to sea.
News From the Transports.
Uncle Sam Is about to rush coal to
China for the men-of-war. That article
is getting very scarce in Chinese waters
and a supply is wanted at once. The naval
colliers Xero and Justin have been put in
commission and the former vessel will g-et
away with a full cargo inside of a week.
Each vessel will be commanded by a na
val officer, but all the remainder of the
crews will be civilians. The first, second,
third and fourth officers will all come
from the merchant service and the en
gineers will come from the Marine En
gineers' Association. Some little work has
to be done on the. Justin, but the chance3
are that August 1 will see her on her way
to China.
The orders in regard to the transport
Hancock have been changed. Instead of
landing her passengers at Nagasaki she
will push through to Taku on a rush or
der, and will probably make a record run
to the Chinese coast.

FROM

and
SHORE
III. I
(Concluded.)
A significant difference of temperament
is manifested between the earlier painters
and Michael Angelo in these decorations
of the Sistine Chapel. Take, for Instance,
the picture of "Christ Delivering the
Keys to Peter." by Peru^lno. the master
of Raphael, a work which, though full of Â¦
grace, beauty and even dignity, is unlm- t
Â¦ pressive and almost commonplace in its i
! spirit and full of incongruities and ab- ;
j surditiea. Of altogether different temper :
j was Michael Angelo. who In his decora- '
j tions of the ceiling and of the space be- ,
j hind the altar speaks of things past and i
[ to come and thunders denunciation upon ;
sin with all the power of the prophets
whom his mighty brush described. The j
work Is divided in nine unequal spaces, j
in which the creation, the flood, etc.. are j
seen. Around these illustrations, between 'Â¦.
j the pointed lunettes above/ each window, '
Â¦ 13 a row of seven prophets and five sibyls, i
j In the lunettes themselves are the- ances- j
I tors of Christ who are awaltmg his com- !
! Ing, and on the tops of the pillars between |
I which each prophet and sibyl sits are i
j nude figures, which seem the forces of the j
I natural and spiritual world, agitated by '
| the expectation of some event that shall '
1 move both the physical universe and tne j
i soul cf man. The individual features of
j this majestic work are too well known to (
I require any elaborate description, and
therefore we will touch upon only such
i of them as seem to possess a peculiar
i beauty, interest or suggestlvenes*.
It was thirty years after the ceiling oi I
the Sistine Chapel wa3 painted, and in the |
reign of another Pope, that Michael An- i
hi? works delight." the eye*. There is no
hint of Corrpgpio in the paintings of ar.y
othfr man: he is sul jreneris. Ilia picmr-s
in the gallery at Parma known as '"The
Day" is regarded as his finest work. It
depicts the Virgin and Child. St. Jerome
and Mary Magdalen. A work more beau
tiful in color, tone and expf>s?ion dor3
not exist. The churches of Parma are
filled with works of Corregsrio. all of
which, however, have suffered seriously
from the ravages of tinvr*. A very plead
ing work of his Is yet preserved, however,
in the suppressed nunnery of St. Paul.
where the room of the abbess is com
pletely decorated with early mythological
works from hia bruÂ«h.
Our survey of Italian art. necessarily
murh condensed, may well be concluded
in Venice. The ducal palace 19 the chief
treasury of Venetian art: It illustrate*
Paul Veronese. Tintoretto and others of
their time by some of their finest exam
ples", and here better than elsewhere can
the eÂ«sentially decorative character of
Venetian painting be satisfactorily ob
served. The halls of state and of council
are elaborately decorated with splendid
paintings framed in the walls and ceiling
by richest moldings of heavily plated irold.
In the hall of council the frteze is formed
by a row of seventy-six po-traits cf
Doges, extending entirely around th*
room, and twenty-one large paintings by
Tintoretto. Veronese and others cover
nearly every foot of the three-quarters of
an acre of space in wall and celling 1 . The
most remarkable of these works is th-i
"Paradise" of Tintoretto, which occupies
the wall over the throne and is repute I
to be the largest oil paintins on canvas
in the world. It is Â¦Â» by 7S feet in dimen
sions and contains at least 500 figrures. It
is full of beautiful faces arui graceful
forms, 13 admirably composed, colored and
lighted, and is marked by great strength.
1 gelo completed his labors here by produc
ing his great work on "The Last Judg
ment." He was in his sixtieth year and at
the zenith of his powers. The picture is
of huge dimensions â over &4 by 70 feetâ
and it contains a vast number of figures.
The crowded forms are drawn in every
i conceivable attitude and they are grouped
'. with marvelous effectiveness. This work
! reveals the mind of a man quite removed
| from the calm indifference of Perugino
1 and the suave elegance of Raphael, a
! man essentially a prophet and seer, de
; nunciatory of evil and perceiving the
swift approach of retribution.
Raphael's work in the decoration of the
Vatican began in the same year that saw
the inauguration of Michael Angelo's la
bors in the Sistine chapel. The creat
â¢ event of the Pope's reign was the rebuild
ing of St. Peter's, and the mind of his
Holiness naturally turned upon the crea
tion of a fresco to commemorate it. by
showing forth the power of the Christian
religion. The so-called "Dispute of the
Sacrament." or, better, "Theology." evi
dently presents this idea rather than that
of a doctrinal controversy, as was former
ly thought. In the air is seen God the
Father, in an attitude of majestic eim
plicity; beneath him Christ, the Virgin
and John the Eaptist. on either side of
whom are patriarchs, prophets and evan
gelists. On the earth are the fathers of
the church, preachers and religious writ
ers, among whom are Savonarola and
Dante. The wcrk is in Raphael"s purest
style, unaffected as yet by the influence
of' Michael Angelo. The greatest work of
Raphael s genius In fresco painting is the
so-called "School of Athens." which fills
the wall opposite the "Theology." and
represents the power of philosophy. It
shows the highest powers of composition,
draughtsmanship and expression, present
ing the various schools of reason in their
relations to each other in a marvelous
way. The general thought moves in a
great circle. Its lower side, upon the floor
beneath the steps, is occupied by the orig
inators of earthly and empirical sciences
âEpicurus. Pythagoras. Xenocratea. Eu
clld, Ptolemy and Zoroaster. Diogenes
sprawls on the steps and connects
thÂ» higher and lower orders of thought.
The graceful figure in armor at the left
of the upper grtiup is Xenophon. to whom
and some friends Socrates Is speaking,
and in thÂ«> center are the commanding
forms of Aristotle and Plato, the former
appealing to nature, the ground of his
studies the latter to heaven as the source
of all wisdom. The imposing architecture
adds much to the breadth and grandeur of
the v.-ork which stands as the hlrheat
achievement of the Italian renaissance.
where classic model' were followed In all
branches of sculpture, painting and liter
ature. The design shows also the fact
that In it art breaks forth from eccle-
Fiastlcal control and enters the service of
other masters.
In the "Loggia." or the gallery of the
Vatican, the desipms . were made by Ra
phael and the work was done by his pu
pils. The mere designing of this corridor
was a work of great importance, for all
the ideas came from the one fertile brain
the ecer.es from thn Old and New Testa
ments in the ceiling, the decorative sup
ports of figure, architecture and ara
besque and the original and charming or
namentation at the sides of the windows.
The work upon which Raphael was en
gaged at the time of his death in 1220 was
the "Transfiguration." which is now pre
served In the Vatican gallery. The upper
part was finished by his own hand and the
lower portion was completed by Giulio
Romano. .**'.
One of the great art shrine? of Europe
is the rhurch of Santa Maria del!* 1 Graz!<Â»
in Milnn. by reason of its holding in !?>â¢
cloisters the Immortal work of Leonardo
da Vinci, the famous "Last Supper." This
old work, perhaps the be?t-known picture
in the world. 13 now a melancholy ruin.
Hardly anv features can be seen, the
forms are vapue and ghostly and in on!v
one or two faces can the quality of the
original expression be guesspd. Its de
struction Is greatly tn be deplored. The
picture was a monument to> the new
movement in art that Leonardo an
nounced, and we have but to compare it
as it was in Its prime with the master
pieces of the I'mhrian and Florentine
schools of the same period to see how it
surpasses them all in balance of cjesisrn.
expression of emotion, interest in thÂ«Â»
groups, dramatic force and artistic re
pose. The personality of Leonardo exer
cised a strong Influence and his phenom
enal versatility has heenme a byword.
The fruitful fifteenth century produced
not only Raphael. Michael Angela, Leo
nardo. Titian, but also the Ariel of the
renaissance. Correegio. The works of this
master are to be found in all the leading
galleries of Kurope. but his best pictures
are still at Parma, where he lived and
died. There alone can he be studied un
derstandinsly. As Titian is pre-eminent
in color, Leonardo In expression. Michael
Ansrelo In dramatic action and Raphael
In form, so is Correggio, par excellence,
the master of light and shade and joyful
emotion. His atmosphere can be Inhaled,
and the golden sunlight that shines in
variety and approprtater.esa of expression.
The most beautiful room in the ducal
palace is the hall of the college, which fs
glorious in its decorations bv Veronese. It
is relatively small, but well lierhted. rich
in pilded carvings ar.d all abloom with the
superb canvases of the srreat painter.
Over the throne ia a memorial picture of
the battle of Lepar.to. and in the elegant
ceiling are about twentv other work-s
showing: the devotion of Venice to re
ligion and justice, her protection by Nep
tune and Mars and various female figures
of surpassing beauty which typify the
rewards and enjoyments that come to a
prosperous commonwealthâ the whol^
forming one of the most interesting and
beautiful scheires of decoration in the
world. Little inferior to the hall of th*
college is the antechamber connected
with it. which is adorned in similarly gor
geous style and holds some of the finest
examples of Tintoretto in existence. They
are far from being of even merit, but the
best are of indescribable and stimulating 1
beauty of color, grace of drawing and
charm of expression. The "Marriage of
Bacchus and Ariadne" is a ma't^rpiece.
Of almost equal perfection is "Mercury
and the Three Graces."
Of the imperial triumvirate of Venetian
paintings. Titian is the moat remarkable
figure. In the church where he is buried.
Santa Maria dei Frari. is a worthy me
morial of his fame in his own gr^at paint
ing of "The Madonna of the Pesaro Fam
ily." Here the family is represented
kneeling before the Virgin, who looks
down upon them kindly. She is clothed
in red and blue, and the white veil on
her head glisters like a snow wreath in
the sun. The Â«Tiild. peeping otlt sportively
from under this, is dancing in infantile
glee at St. Francis, behind whom la An
thony, in robes of sober russet. St. Peter,
a man with splendid head and majestic
expression, turns from his reading to re
gard the worshipers, whose glowing robes
are shot through with the threads of
heavy gold embroidery. Massive and
graceful stone pillars shoot up. apparent
ly without limit, into the air.-gnd across
the sky of deep. luminous blue are spread
the folds o* a magnificent golden banner,
held by a warrior in complete mall. This
Is the finest votive picture in the whole
world. Titian in it said his last word of
religious art so far as color, richness and
harmony of tone and brilliancy of style
are concerned. We shall find a mnw
striking: instance of the grasp of his
thought In his great "Assumption" at the
Academy, but it is here that he appears
at the acme of h.'s skill. It may well be
that his power as a painter of the f-sure
is illustrated bette-r in Rome, where in
the palace of the Borgias hangs his cele
brated "Sacred and Profane Love"â a rep
resentative example of the work of the
creates* painter of the human form that
the world has seen.
It la a striking proof of the vigor of
Titi.in's art that, however hackneyed h!s
theme may be. he endows it with a force
and novelty and beauty of which it was
before unsuspected. Hardly any subject
has been more generally employed than
that which furnishes the subject for his
picture of "The Presentation of the Vir-
Jrin." in the Academy at Venice. Titian
gives the motive its most sumptuous set
ting, and proves* his power over the higher
things of art by miking the simpler p!Â«Â«
ments of his work excel in effect those
that arÂ» more srandlose. The mndest lit
tle figur** c-f the Virgin easily dominates
the whole group. One recognizes a spirit
In her which makes her superior to all
who surround her. The art that dot-? so
much, without resort to facial expression
in the main figure or the description of
profound emotion in those around her. Is
a great art. combining In perfect propor
tions naturalness and ideality.
The "Assumption" is Â«Â»aua!ly considered
Titian's masterpiece, and it is certainly
one of the greatest painting 1 ' in Europe.
A sublime subject this, and worthy of trie
highest powers of an artist such as Tit
ian. He rose nnMy to a realization of the
theme, and although in some of the tech
nical qualit!?* of jrood painting It ia not
as good as the "Madnnna of the Pesan>
Family." so far as grandeur of concep
tion and force of expression are con
cemed. it is wor t^of^Mt* fggfo^

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, July 24.â Wheat had not recovered
from the injection of foreign bearish news
when the market opened to-day and Septem
ber began the session H3*S:C to H-S 5 Â»c down
at 7CÂ»Â»c to TGVic. The crowd figured that with
little export business here, probable lnr^e
Southwest receipts and the. Increased Russian
and Danubian shipments announced yesterday,
wheat was not worth prevailing prices. Fol
lowing this the market, on covering by shorts
for profits and a little scattered buying, rallied
to 76?ic. The bulge held about like a small
boy hanging to the tail of a greased pig on
the Fourth of July. It slid off with the great
est ea.se, helped by a decline at Paris, re
ports that France would ralFe wheat enough
for her own consumpton and that Russia held
a large supply of hold-over wheat and by lack
of outside support. September early declined
to 73 : i,e, rallied to 76ViG"6Uc, lost Its hold again
anil thfn on Bradstreet's announcement that
the world's visible had decreased 2.C00.00O
bushels recovered to 7GtÂ»c. Thia bulge, like
the others, was lost and the close found the
market at Its weakest, September llg'fjlHc un
der yesterday at 63'4c.
Corn was fillet and lower early, but steadied
after a good concession in prices. There were
heavy rains In the best growing States. Sep
tember closed Ifal^c down at 3SHc.
Oats were relatively firm, supported by the
Iowa report that oats In shock and in stack
had suffered from the incessant rains. Sep
tember closed L iC down at 23VgC.
Compared with the grains provisions were
firm, easing but little In sympathy with thÂ»
grain weakness. The market felt the sustain
ing influence of light hog receipts and liberal
shipments of produce. Trade was quiet. Sep
tember pork closed unchanged, lard 5c lower

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits
Receipts of Melons continue to Increase and
the market Is declining. Grapes, too, are shad
ing off under slowly increasing supplies.
Good Peaches are higher under a brisk ship
ping demand, but a good deal of the stock
comlns in is poor and slow of sale at low
prices. Apricots and Plums are dull and fea
tureless. The market Is heavily etocked with
Bartlett Pears, owing largely to the Sacra
mento failure. Figs continue scarce. Berries
stnnd about the same.
Lemons and Limes continue firm at the ad
vance

LOCAL MARKETS.
NEW YORK. July St.â Those who have
â¢ought to read In the recent stock market a
reflection (f general conditions outside were
etlll further confounded by the clcÂ»e of to
iay'f market. The weakness, which showed
not bC adequately accounted fur by anything
In the news of the day. But as the result ot
effort* by professional (peculator* to take thÂ»:r
profits without any (iÂ»mand for stocks to ab
sorb the offerings the day's movement was
capable of explanation. Efforts wt-re made la
sustain the rr.arket la the morning- by manipu
lation of a few <if the sp*ciaituÂ«. especially
tupar and the T^bacct-s. Later in the dav
Tcl-aceo wa* exclusively rolled upon as a. sus
taining influence and linally that stock, after
having been pushed up nearly r> points dropped
bark more than 2 In the genera! Â¦reaJmes*
*;th which the jr.arket clo.-e<i. Tolmcco's net
gain Is 2%*C but all ot the earlier rliw Ir.
tfugar wa* w:;>ej out. Many stocka show losses
of a pol:.t or upward for the day. There was
resizing in evidence fn.ini the opening, but
the first point of acute weakness to develop
Â»aÂ« in lirookiyn Transit. The recent advance
In this stock has evidently tx-en in anticipation
cf the favorable decision announced yester
day of the right rf the company to charg3
10-cer.t fare? to Coney Is'.and and realizing
waÂ« very large during U*e day. The lai-t
price to-day was T.6, coxrii'art-ii with CO ;.n*
yesterday afternoon. Doubtless the most v*>
tent Influence- In the late reaction was the por
tentous growl emitted by the recognized recent
l>ear leader from his Kurujiean retirement in
*n interview. Tlie r>uT<=irlÂ«. interest In Um
rr.ark*-t proved wholly inadequate to absorb
the ci{Iert:i(,6 to realize and a rapidly declining
fcale of pi!''"" vva 8 the natural result. There
v i.Â» a feeling of doubt aroused in the minds
of speculator* by the general skepticism ex
pressed ly i .*...-Â¦ oiHnmentators over yester
day* rite which was universally attributed
to artificial manipulation. The mn-enpoR-?
tnrrit of ffold lor exjxirt yesterday, which
caused Â»^cie feeling of relief in the then op
tlnv.istic mood cf Fj'eculaU.fti. gave place to-
Cui U a frr-sh conviction that a larpe outpo
of f/M 1* imminent and that a period of
tartnpency In the money market later In tlu
summer ran harilly be avoided. Rates of ster
ling exchange in New York were not quotably
higher, although the market was reported !lrm
and sterling exchange advanced an additional
fraction in Paris. Call loans and discounts
toth advanced l:i London and exchange booses
are of the i-plnlon that ;Â¦'-Â¦'. will go to Paris

"The Armour Pa.ckinÂ»r Company, through

Though the amount Involved in the suit
1e Ema'l, the principle Its final adjudica
tion will establish will be of great impor
tance to the many corporations doing
Viueiness under the incorporation laws ot
this Stat**.
The plaintiff corporation contends that
its franchise to do business in this State
is non-assessable. It is paid that many
Xrthcr corporations organized under the
Jaws of States other than California are
lurking the Armour Company in this ac
tion, as the final decision will be of inter
tf-t to all.
Should the court determine that the
franchises of these foreign corporations
are non-assessable, not only would the
loss be a great one to the State but to
those corporation* organized under the
laws of this Stale, whose franchises are
assessable. Released of the burden of
taxation, foreign corporations could morÂ»
than successfully compete with local or
iranlzations. The FUit riled yesterday. It Id

1 CYCLE ASSOCIATION
PATH ALMOST ASSURED
COLORED MOVEMENT TO
AID MITCHELL ON FOOT
ART AND ARTISTS.
IT Is a prraceless fashion with some Cal
ifornians, artists and laymen both, to
compare, to our utmost disadvantage,
the art conditions here with those of
the East. There is some small truth
in their accusations of Ignorance, unap
precjatlon and lark of interest on the part
of our people, but that we ne-d not there
fore affect the "entirely inconsolable" a
little exhibition now oyen at Golden Gate
Hall amply proves.
The exhibition of \K. Moran Drown s
lastost paintinir. "Helen of Troy." a com
panion picture to his famous flOO.000 paint
ing, "The Judgment of Paris." is no: per
haps a proof cf what California can do,
but it is a'hright and shining piece of evi
dence as to what the lauded Kast will
sometimes tolerate in \X\f art line.
"Helen of Troy." a largo canvas, six by
fourteen feet, painted In "pa5tille with
wax." as the cicerone kindly informs us,
shows a composition closely rÂ«Â»sÂ»mhIinK
the classic boarding-house mantelshelf in
design. An amorphous nudity on a couch
in the center, two equally ambiguous
creatures at either end of it. standing sen
tinel fashion, roses and doves and things
âand there you have it. For some unex
plained reason Mr. Drown only a?ks $25.
0)0 for the fair Helen, but it is announced
that there will be opportunity afforded to
all art lovers, at 50 cents per head, to
view her gracious charms.
There are two other pictures equally
amazing alongside the lady of Troy, for
one of which the Princess of Chimay is
said to have pof-ed. It is explained that
three rival Boston beauties posed for the
"Helen of Troy," which is painted in
three sections, "because none of them
would have consented to 'stand' had she
known her hated rival was also being Im
mortalized." There Is slow music behind
the scenes and the literary art is also
called Into- requisition to add Interest to
the show in the shape of some monstrous
ly bad poetry describing the pictures.
W. Moran Drown comes from Boston â
probably that statement is sufficient to
support the humor of the case â and will
go from here to Australia with the fair
Helen, provided sho Is not sold in the
meantime. She will probably accompany
him.
Mrs. Mary Menton has returned from
Ben Lomond with a number of Interesting

planation they paid they were on a strike.
It appears that the scale of wages has
been $4 to $Â»> a week for boys employed In
the factory, and an increase was demand
ed. The boys were told that their ser
vices would be no longer required when
their determination to strike became
known, and that with one or two excep
tions men would take their places. This
Incensed them.
One lad. Hilly Patterson, remained,
faithful to the firm. He was satisfied with
his wages and would net Join the mob
that lingered outside. He hid under a
desk In the office and covered himself up
with old carpets. On the outside the cries
of the mob could be hean!. and fifteen
pairs of fl?ts were eager to land on Billy's
physiognomy. The atrikfrs called upon
him to come out. but he would not budge.
The foreman guarded the doorway.
It was then that Barigalupi Lagomar
sino drove bj' in hi3 scavenger wagon full
of old eggs, and while two boys held the
horses' heads the others unloaded the
wagon against the side of the building.
Policeman .limes Rpgan. the channel
detective, and John McSorl<Â»y. who gained
distinction by walking out of the central
station without his trousers, led the at
tack on the "trikcrs and drove them 8omÂ«
distance away. They then took Billy Pat
terson by the hand and led him to a street
car. The boys followed the minions of
the law and" their charge, but the car
went away too quickly for them. Police
still guard th^ premises, and the boys
say they will make a hard fight for rein
statement and higher wages.
WILLIAM T. PRICE.
PRICE IS SLATED
TO SUCCEED ESOLA
THE Po'.lce Commissioner? have asked
the 'egal opinion of City'and County
Attorney Lane as to Â¦whether th^y
have the power to reinstate "William
T. Price as a lieutenant of police. There
is a rumcr current, which has behind it
s:Â«Tiif.car.t facts that lend it credibility.
that If Lake's advice permits It Price
will be reinstated and put In charge of
the California-street police station. Tho
request for the cpin:oa in itself show3
which way the Â¦wind is blowing. L.:eu
tenar.t Esola's promotion to the rank >:t
captain In charge of the property clerk's
office, as announced exclusively In The
C'a'l yesterday, leaves a vacancy in ti.e
list of lieutenants and there is a strong
probability that Price will be given th<*
position.
A year aro Price, then lieutenant in
charge of the Chinatown squad, retired
under Sre. He asserted his innocence of
alleged offenses, but was disrated with-
out being tried, and retired on a pension.
Under the new Police Commission he was
ordered back for duty as sergeant, and
at once aj'plied to' be reinstated as lieu
tenant.
His ease was set for hearing a week
ago, but was postponed till last night,
whÂ»^n it again went over for a week, to
await the rendering of Lane's opinion.
Several members of the commission are
known to hold the belief that Price was
made the victim of grave injustice, and
that the fact that he was not removed
from the force entirely is the Iwst evi
dence that no proof was found of his
guilt.
L'.eutenant E.=o!a will become a captain
August 1. and with a vacancy existing
among the lieutenants Price's vindication
will probably not be dpferred lonjrer than
the meeting of the commission next Tues
day night. The former lieutenant has a
host of friends who have never doubted
his lnnoncence and who will rejoice to
know of his prospective reinstatement.
The Business Men's Republican Club
which was organized at the California
Hotel last Monday evening will take an
active part in the political cam
paign. The membership of the club was
increased yesterday by additional signa
tures. There will be a meeting of the
executive committee of the new organ
ization shortly after the chairman, Wil
liam H. Wheeler, returns to the city. The
chairman is a man of energy and char
acter who will not allow email obstacles
to hinder tho progress of the work laid
cut lor the committee.
The announcement yesterday that lead
ing business* men of the city had resolved
to energetically outer the contest in be
iialt ot gnou yu\irnmem and eiean poll
ucfl cauteo a siâ¢t commotion m me
tamp ot tne cuiuiu political bosses. Tno
btep tuKen by trie business men was not
taken one nuur ioo soon, as the strikers
tnat loiter around the Mint saloon were
boasting that tne people wouid not turn
out ana vote at the primary flection.
The following of Kelly and Crimmlns
is already falling off. .Last week poli
ticians wno fancied that the people might
f-tay away from the polls on August 14
were trimming to eaten a friendly breezo
from boss headquarters. Yesterday these
salf-same statesmen openly aeclared
themselves against the bosses. If a reso
lute and intelligent campaign is made
Kelly and Crlmmins can oq beaten out In
every Assembly district. The clean Re
publicans of the Twenty-eighth and
Twenty-ninth districts are now encour
aged to tight the Mint saloon bosses.
There was talk some time ago of
making no resistance to boss rule in these
districts, but leaders of the anti-boss
movement are strongly in favor of mak
ing an earnest and aggressive battle to
overthrow bossism in its stronghold.
In the Forty-tirst Dibble and his fol
lowers will work with the desperation of
despair to carry the district against the
force of good government and clean poli
tics. Rainey and Lanigan are preparing
to give Dibble all the Democratic sup
port they can rally at the primary elec
tion for his delegates. The Republicans
of the district do not want Dibble to rep
reFent them, but as he is clever at or
ganization and skillful in manipulation he
frequently secures the regular nomination
of Uie party and then seeks to place his
opponents In the light of bolters. The Re
publicans this year have resolved that he
.^hall not have the regular nomination,
and he cannot get it unless the Demo
crats desert their own party In a body
and cast their votes at tne primary elec
tion for Dibble delegates.
The list of statesmen willing to serve In
the Senate of California gradually grows
larger. In the Senatorial district com
posed of the Twenty-eighth and Twenty
ninth Assembly districtn, the Mint saloon
bosses have slated Assemblyman C. K.
Kenneally for the Republican nomination.
Other Republican aspirants are Thomas
J. Horr.n. James Daly and Nelson Burn
ham. In the Democratic camp Joseph
Plunkett is the candidate of the Phelan
faction for Senator. The anti-Phelan
Democrats are supporting Jchn D. Cogh
lan for the Senatorial nomination.
The Thirty-third and Thirty-fifth As
sembly districts comprise another Sena
torial district. Each party has several
candidates. Assemblyman W. H. Cobb,
ex-Senator Maher and C. W. Taber are
spoken of for the Republican nomination.
Stephen A. Byrne and Thomas E. Curran
are Democratic asplrantB. The latter Is
said to be Infected with bubonic Phelan>
' :n.
There Is no scarcity of candidates in
the Senatorial District, which embraces
the Thirty-first and Thirty-ninth Assem
bly districts. The Republicans present
John J. Tyrrell. ex-Assemblyman James
Wilkinson and T. V. Kddy. The Demo
crats come to the front Â¦with Thomas J.
Hlckey, ex-Assemblyman Tim Treacy,
Theodore Roach and John Kennedy. .
The Thirty-seventh and Thirty-eighth
Assembly districts comprise the Sena
torial district which has been misrepre
sented for the past four years by Eddie
Wclfe. He is a candidate fur renomlna
tion. but will be shelved If the good people
of the district will turn out and Join the
effort to down the bosses. Other Repub
lican aspirants are General E. S. Salomon,
Frank Grimes. William H. Rickard and
George \V. Dlxon.
The Democrats of this district are not
suffering for lack of Senatorial timber.
C. A. Sweigert, the Fourth of July orator,
is heralded as the organization candidate.
H. I. Mulcreavy Is In the field with a clean
bill of health.
The North Beach Senatorial District em
braceÂ« the Fnrty-fourth and Forty-fifth
Assembly districts. There the aspirants
for the honor of serving In the Senate are
legion. Republicans are determined to -win
out this year. A few of the Republican
candidates In this district are: R. H.
Jones, Dr. C. A. Glover. Mike Barry. J.
H. Kelson. J. F. Martononi. Thomas
Chandler and 1). F. Crowley. The Demo
crats are considering the claims of M. II.
Hernon and Dr. T. B. W. Leland.
Thirty-Ninth District Democrats.
The Bryan and Stevenson Ciub of the
Thirty-ninth Assembly District will meet
to-night in Saratoga Hall. It 1b expected
that a number of prominent Democrats
will address the club.

CHICAGO, July 24.-A sensation was
sprung at Hawthorne to-day by the an
nouncement that the judges of Haw
thorne had received notllicatlon from
the Washington Park officials that they
have ruled J., Hi (Texas) Smith, the wide
ly known horse owner and. plunger, off.
the turf. Their action, it was stated, was
taken on the strength of representations
to the Washington Park stewards by J.
Carroll, owner of Catastrophe.
Carroll, it was reported, had charged
Smith was accepting $100 in consideration
of an agreement on his part not to claim
Catastrophe out of the last Belling race
in which the horse participated at the
Washington Park meeting. Smith de
clares the charges absolutely false, but
his entry in the second race to-day â Vo
hicer â was scratched by the judges.
Considerable trouble Is anticipated In
connection with the ruling, as Smith says
he will not submit to the decision.

Why Michael Schuler of Stockton
Wants a Deed Annulled.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON. July 24.-A sensational
suit was filed this afternoon by Michael
Schuler. who lives at 1245 East Lafayette
street in this city, against his wife, Marie
Barbara Schuler. The complaint alleges
that the plaintiff on August 24, 1S91. made
a deed of gift of lots in this city to his
wife. He had the deed acknowledged, but
not recorded nor delivered, as it was in
tended not to take effect until after
Schuvler's death. The deed was hidden
away, but on July 9 of this year the de
fendant quarreled with the plaintiff. She
took the deed and had it recorded. Schu
ler now asks the court to annul the deed
and assess his wife for the costs.
Wung Kai Kee, Who Was Employed
by a Newspaper, Escapes Punish
ment by His Countrymen.
Special 1 Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, July 24.â Wungr Kal Kee
of. Chinatown will be troubled no more.
He has been acquitted by the lodge
which met on Monday night to pass judg
ment upon his case.
AVung said that he had not been disturb
ed at all, and that the man who had been
stationed at the window across the street
had not been seen. A visitor at Wung;':-;
store, who appeared to be well informed
upon the situation, said that at the meet-
Ing of the lodge Wung had been declared
not guilty cf circulating false news.
"But." he added. "Wung had a. narrow
escape. If he had been caught he wouid
surely have been killed."

Ex-Patrolman Fowler Believes His

LOS AXGELES, July 24.â Frank M.
Fowler, an ex-policeman, to-day Instituted
two. suits against members of the local

and false imprisonment. One suit is
against Chief of Police Charles M. Elton
and his bondsmen, the National Surety
Company of New York, and the other is
against Police Sergeant Jeffries and Po
licemen Henderson and Mercer. When
Fowler was dropped from the force he re
fused to give up his badge and club. One
nig-ht, while he was seated In a restau

PANAMA, July 24.â Firing between rev
olutionists and Government troops began
early yesterday afternoon at LÂ»a Boca.
The rebels were landed from warships In
possession of the revolutionists. The
fighting continued nearly all the rest of
the day and was without decisive results
The Government troops Intrenched
around the railroad bridge have main
tained their defensive positions. Some o*
them did not take part in to-day's action.
The rebels also maintained their position
at Corozol and other points on the rail
road line, where they purpose to Intercept
the regulars coming from Colon under
General Sarria. His force is 150 strong.
Colonel Thayer. superintendent of tlie
Panama Railroad, has had an interview
with General Herrera in Corozol. The
revolutionary chief assured Colonel Thay
er that his forces would not Interfere m
any way with traffic on the railroad and
so far he has kept his word. The hue
continues clear and trains run as usual.
Railroad traffic has been suspended tem
porarily, however, at La Boca since fight
ing began there. All the La Boca rail
road employes have come here for safety.
All the business places in Panama cor-
tinue closed. Provisions and other neces
saries of life are growing scarce and are
hard to get at high prices. Public excite
ment is unabated. XIany families residing
in unprotected localities have taken ref
uge in the Grand Central Hotel for safety
in case of an outbreak in the city. At the
request of the foreign consuls all for
eigners here are placing their national
flajrs over their business houses and
dwellings. The display of bunting glve3
the city a gay appearance.
The Government has issued a decree
calling to arms all Colombian citizens be
tween the ages of IS and 60 years. All
public employes not complying with the
decree will be heavily fined. It is believed
decisive action between the. regulars ar.d
revolutionists must take place very soon.
If the present situation is kept up much
longer the consequences are likely to be
serious. No American war vessel is at
Panama or Colon.

lutionary Forces, Gives Assurance I
That Panama Railroad Will
Not Be Damaged.

Hackmen "Will Register Kicks.
Hackmen and livery stable keepers left
their fiery chargers to themselves for a
time last night while they met In the
rooms of the ITnited Undertakers* Asso
ciation, at Fifth and Jessie streets, to or
panize the Carriage Owners' and Drivers'
Protective Association. The Immediate
object is. organized opposition to the new
ordinance wMch imposes a quarterly li
cense of $15 upon solicitors, runners and
hackmen. Tho hackmen claim that the
ordinance was not originally meant to in
clude them, and that it Is a source of
much hardship among their ranks. La<n
night 150 members signed the roll. The
following officers were then elected- Wil
liam McLaughlin, president: Thomas
Martin, vice president; John Dowling
secretary; "William JIcLaughlin Jr.,
treasurer. Ano'her meeting at the same
place has been called for next Friday
night, when a petition will be drawn up
asking the Supervisors to amend the or
dinance.
f DESPONDENT WOMAN" AND MAN SHE LOVED. T
LEA BELLEMORE. known as Mrs.
Lillian Dent, tried to commit sui
cide in the rqar'of David Dent's
saloon at 26 Steuart street early yes
terday morning. She broke Into the place
and, securing a revolver, shot herself in
the left breast. The bullet struck the
breast bono and was dellectcd, passing
around the chest and coming out under
the left shoulder. The woman was hur
ried to the Harbor Hospital, where Dr.
Victor Putnam dressed the wound, and
later expressed the opinion that the
wounded one would recover.
There are peculiar circumstances con
nected with the shooting. David Dent,
the man in the case, always speaks of
the woman as "my wife." Miss Bellemore
insists that she has never been married
to Dent, and because Dent would not
have the ceremony performed and was
making love to her sister, Lea was driven
to commit the rash act.
"I am now 24 years old," said the young
woman in the hospital yesterday, ''and I
ran away from my home in Colorado with
Dent seven years ago. He was a gamb
ler and â¬ goo<l fellow,' and I liked him and
like him still. Five years ago a child was
born to us and before the time came I
went down on mv. knees to Dave and
asked him to make me his wife. He re
fused, and then I took rough on rats, but
unfortunately did not take enough. Ever
since I have worked hard and it wae my
money that set Dave up in the saloon on
Steuart street. ' :';.-'
"Lately my sister Ida came to live with
us at 1813^ Mason street. She is younger
than I. Hard ;- work - has -made me look
older than I really am. Dave has been
paying her attention and I could not stand
it so I tried again to kill myself."
Near the woman's right hand as she lay
in the saloon was found the following
written on three pages of an order book:
David Dent
You will please excuse me for being so bad
but what I have stood with you would make
eny woman crazy. She came home and told me
when she was sick that time you took her up
on your lap like a baby. Xow you and her
can take care of my baby.
"Wished to be your wife for menny years.
LEA BELLEMORE
DAVID DENT.
you can't make love any more before my
face. Seven years la coming to me for being
with you and you an't married me after all
your promises and now I think I h.ive suffered
enouch for you. Take sood care of my baby
if you don't do not
Well this is all wishing yet to be your wife
LEA BELLEMORE,
Your best friend -LUlle
Good by David Dent; please kiss the baby
for me, if you don't care for me.
Please don't blame it on him for I done it
my self. LEA B.
Mr. Dent for to read
Kood by for the last
This la all for this world.'
David dent has been my pet for years so I
can't Etand for him to make love to eny one
else L.IL,L,IK.
I am here, don't you see. lnjoy yourself for
the last David dent to night.
Dent says the woman was insanely jeal
ous, and insists that she is his wife. He
visited her at the hospital and later
brought Dr. Hartley to call upon her.
Everything possible had been done for the
woman, however. Lato in the afternoon
it was decided to send her to her home.
Quarreled and Took Poison.
Joseph Hatismann, who until a weekapo
was employed by the Pacific Transfer
Company and lives at Eddy and Leaven
worth streets, attempted to end his life
at an early hour yesterday morning by,
swallowing a dose of carbolic acid. He
was taken to the Receiving Hospital and
will recover. Hausmann was Infatuated
with Mrs. Margaret Rankine, who has
been separated from her husband for
some time and lives at 223 Perry street.
On Monday night he -was drinking with
her, and they quarreled. Â¦ About 2 o'clock
yesterday morning he went to her house,
and because she refused to allow him to
enter he swallowed carbolic acid.. When
the police were notified yesterday morn
ing Captain Seymour detailed Detectives
T. B. Gibson and Whittaker on the case,
as it was thought that Mrs. Rankine
might have given him the poison; but
they soon came to the conclusion that
he had taken it himself, and when he
was able to talk he admitted that he was
a fool and had swallowed the poison in a
fit of anger. The detectives found that
he had been -telling several saloon-keep
ers on Monday night that If Mrs. Ran
kine "went back on him" he would com
mit suicide.

REGENTS ADOPT
BUDGET IS IT
IS REPORTED
John E Budd Poses as an
Economist and Votes
Against It
The* Roard of Regents of the University
of California held an adjourned mt-f-tine
yesterday afternoon and passed the bud
get as presented by the finance commit
tee, it having been laid over frum the la:?t
rÂ«frular me^tinp. A few additions to the
faculty were made upon recommendation
of President Wheeler. The alumni plan
tor in<TÂ«>atur.g the revenue of the univer
sity was not Â«liscussed.
Keprent Uarnes occupied the chair. Re
gents Wheeler. Foster, Mrs. Hearst, An
derson. Wallace, Rodgcrs. Pardee, 15udd,
Houehton and Reinstein were present.
The l.udjret for the ensuing year shows
a probable deficit of $i;.2Â«. 03. the esti
mated expenses being S44VJ2S #5. ana the
estimated Income $1-'W.2O2 M. Of the ex
pense? S303.4C0 00 is included under the
item of salaries.
Kejrent Uudd posed as an economist,
making thre* unsuccessful attempts t-Â»
effect Favi::gs. He moved that the salary
of Maior J. IJ. Vhoon as counsel for the
Hegents bt? cut from S2Â±J<) to $1SvJ per year.
There was no second. A few minutes later
he move] that the salary of Professor
George Davidson of the chair of geogra
phy be reduced from $4<J-JO to $2S(RÂ». The
silence that followed was oppressive.
Again DO Beeond was heard. Then Ke
pt :u Uudd asked why there should be two
iuYi prof'-ssors in the Latin department.
President Wheeler explained that Pro
â ,,-^r ,MtrriIl was in charge of the de
wrtrr.em. and that after Professor Kel-
Vogg's resignation as president of the uni
versity be had been made emeritus pro
fessor" of Latin, so that his connection
Â¦with the university miKht continue.
"In vi.w of the probable shortage," Re
pent Budd said, "we should deal with
th'fe ouÂ«-*tions without allowing personal
PvmpathU-s to Interfere." â¢< - --' :
President Wheel, r sa!d that Professor
KellopR's servi r <-s would be eminently
useful to the university.
The question was raised whether or not
ProfeSoor John Fryer would be baÂ«-k from
China during the coming collegiate year.
BegCfit S!acK said thai he was informed
that Professor Fryer was already on his
wav back.
President "Wheeler called attention to
the fact that the estimated deficit for
last ytar had been $13,000, but that by
riirid "economy any dt-Iicit whatever had
beÂ«n efcsjic-d. He hoped that would be
the case with the budget under consid
eration.
"J consider it our duty," Regent Rod
pen? said, "to go in debt If necessary for
the bÂ»-.Â«t intÂ«Â»rÂ»-sts of the university. \\ e
v.-;il have an opportupnity to get relief
through the Legislature soon, and I feel
sure that that body will come to our aid."
ttoj^nt Uudd thought pucn nope luiiie.
Â«md he voted njraUist the l>udj?et. All the
other r^K'-ntp present voted for It.
General Houghton stated that the en

LAKE TAHOE
AGAIN IN LINE
Its Status to Be Determined Through
the Maud Bloodworth Habeas
Corpus Petition.
The question has again arisen as to
whether or not the Magdalen Asylum is
successor to or a part of the local indus
trial school, and is to be determined by
the Supreme Court on the 6th of August.
This qvrstlon has been before the Su
preme Court before, but it was dropped
before coming to a final issue.
Knoeh Klood worth yesterday applied for
a writ of habeas corpus for the release of
his daughter Maud, who Is now confined
in the Magdalen Asylum. Last April the
girl, who is 16 years ot age. was arrested
by Officers McMurray and Coleman on a
charge of vatrrancy. She was convicted
before Police Judge Mogan and sentenced
to be Imprisoned in the Industrial School.
She was taken to and is still confined in
the Magdalen Asylum.
The girl's father in his petition for her
release on habeas corpus declares that in
stead of being in the custody of the Sher
iff in a public institution she is deprived
of her liberty by the Mother Superior,
Sister Mary de Sales. The asylum is al
luded to in the petition as "a sectarian
institution, or boarding-house, for fallen
women."

James Taylor Rogers declined and refused to
answer each and all of these questions. Kach
and all of these questions were material and
relevant to the charge then under investigation
by the Grand Jury.
Wherefore, affiant prays thnt .Tames Taylor
Rogers be cited to appear before your honor
able court on Monday, July 23. 1!>'"'<\ at 2 p. m.
to show op.use. If h? has any, why he should
not be punished for contempt.
On reading the affidavit Mr. Henley, on
behalf of Rogers, demanded time In
which to prepare an answer. District
Attorney Byington informed 'the court
that in view of the nature of the pro
ceedings the respondent had no legal
right to file an answer to Foreman Kib
bler's aflldavit. The court granted the
respondent's request, however, and at 3
o'clock Rogers and counsel returned. Mr.
Henley tiled a demurrer to the aflldavit
but on its being promptly overruled by
Judge Dunne he offered Rogers' affidavit
as an answer. Rogers rose to his feet
and in answer to Clerk A. B. Mahoney,
who administered the oath, he swore that
the contents of the document were cor
rect-. In this manner Rogers admitted his
guilt and acknowledge that if he told the
truth his prosecution on a felony charge
would lie the result.
"If the respondent in this action is in
fear of incriminating himself by answer
ing the questions propounded," said
Judge Bahrs after reading Rogers' affi
davit. "I think it pertinent at this time
to ask what felonv it is that the respond
ent is in fear of. If this investigation
had boon disassociated with the previous
investigation It strikes me that there is
nothing In the questions calling for an
swers that would tend to incriminate the
respondent." [
Rogers was visibly disturbed hut made
no answer. Henley said he was of the
opinion that a continuance should be
granted tnat ne might prepare for any
arguments that arise and to prepare a
new answer which he would tile at the
next session of court.
"It 6triKes me as peculiar that you
are not prepared for tms proceeding,
said Judge Uahra. "This is a matter of
great puoiic- interest and the whole city
seems to be advised of it; that Is, the
whole city with the exception of your
selves. I have no disposition to deny the
right of the respondent to consult counsel
and make such preparation for his defense
as he may see lie. but this preparation
should have been made heretofore. As
I am going away on my vacation I nave
assigned tnis matter to Judge Dunne for
future consideration. He has requested
that I sit v.lth him and in order tha.t this
case may be jointly considered by us an
immediate hearing is necessary. '
"All 1 ask is time to prepare my case;
say until the morning," answered Hen
ley "1 am conlident mat Mr. Kogers can
not be compelled tc answer these ques
"Jt is my contention," salh District At
torney Byington, "that if Ithe respond
ent refuse to answer these; questions he
must state specifically his reasons for re
fusing to do so. If his answers will tend
to disgrace the respondent in the eyes ot
the people and if in the judgment of the
court they do not necessarily tend to in
criminate him, he must answer them, as
they are pertinent to the issue. Any dis
grace that may fall upon him by nis an
swers will not be considered by the court
and that such disgrace will follow is not
suliicient ground for a refusal on his
part. There are leading cases on this
point and all support this theory."
"When my attention was first called to
the fact that Mr. Rogers refused to an
swer these questions," Judge Bahrs paid,
"I had some thought that he was right in
refusing. I have since reached a dif
ferent opinion, however, and at least
agree with the District Attorney that he
should specifically state why he refuses
to answer the questions if he continue to
refuse. I do not believe it an abuse of
discretion, however, to allow the re
spondent and his counsel time in which
to prepare their case and I will order a
continuance, with the consent of Judge
Dunne, until to-morrow morning at II
o'clock, at which time this matter will
be taken up and disposed of."
Rogers then rose and begged leave or
the court to withdraw his answer from
the records, with the right to file an
amended aflldavit. Judge Dunne prompt
lv denied Rogers' motion to withdraw his
answer and it will be preserved among
the records of the court for all time as
the indirect confession of guilt of the
one remaining conspirator. .
Judges Shy of Chretien's Case.
Judge Conlan still persists in his re
fusal to hear the case of John M. Chre
tien, the disgraced attorney, on the charge
of forgery in connection with the Sullivan
estate. The case was continued last
Thursday till yesterday morning: by
Judge Fritz, and because he was leaving
on his vacation, he, as presiding Judge,
assigned It to Judge Conlan's court.
Assistant District Attorney Whiting
called upon Judge Conlan yesterday
morning, but the Judge informed him
that the case was not on his calendar, and
as it had not been legally transferred to
his court he would decline to hear it. He
explained that he had the poolroom cases
and others which would fully occupy his
attention.
Whiting went to Judge Cabaniss and
asked him to take the case. The Judge
said that he was not opposed to hearing
it, but as it had been transferred to
Judge Conlan's court by the presiding
Judge he could not see how he could
legally hear it. Judge Mogan will leave
shortly on his vacation, so that there was
no other Judge to apply to.
J\idge Conlan said Inter that before a
presiding Judge can assign a case from
ono court to another he must get the
consent in writing of the Judge to whose
court it Is assigned and that had not been
done in the Chretien case.
Chief Sullivan and Captain Seymour on
being notified of the state of affairs said
that the best way to get out of the dif
ficulty would be to get the Grand Jury
to return an indictment against Chretien
on the forgery charge and take it alto
gether out of the Police Courts.

ony. Rogors has squirmed from beneath
the laph of the Grand Jury inquisition
only to be forced to a corner from -which ,
there poems to be no escape. On the wit
ness stand before Judge Troutt he ve
hemently denied under oath that the sold
of J. J. Rauer had "convinced" him that
the heirs he represented were not the
heirs of the late Joseph Sullivan. Against
his word stands that of J. J. Rauer, who
has sworn before the Grand Jury that
Rogers only cast off his clients after hav
ing pocketed K*} as compensation for his
consideration of the rights of the â¢â¢lawful"
heir.'John Sullivan. Rogers has not seen
fit to try and outswear Rauer before the I
Grand Jury. For the reason that he did
not the Grand Jury has held the matter
of his indictment in abeyance. Rogers
has now made oath that fear of prosecu
tion on a felony charge actuated him in
defying the Grand Jury's authority. To
day .he will again appear in court, and
Judpes Bahrs and Dunne, sitting in bank.
will determine his fate. HÂ«* will be forced
to specify thf crime he feels guilty of
having committed. The court holds that
it is not discretionary with a witness to
determine whether or not an answer to a
question will t~nd to incriminate him.
Whether or not this would be the result
of an answer is for the court to determine.
The court will determine this point this
morning, and if the decision be against
Rogers' content'on he must answer or go
to 1ail.
