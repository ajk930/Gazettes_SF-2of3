In the Â¦world to which you or I would go

place -where a rill-, trickles over mossy
banks, and nymphs and sylphs and things
chase. themselves round the trunks of an
cient moss-hung trees. . Â¦'A â¢Â»
This -was not the manner of that. glen.
It was dry as a. bone. v '-. Water Â¦* was so
scarce.that the two youngest Gooks, who
did most of the hard work because" they
were too small to defend' themselves,'- ecu
blisters on their, feet arid hands packing
enough water to do "cooking The
Gooks didn't use much water for anything
else. So apt to catch cold from it, -you
know. - . . :-Â¦Â»_. -Â¦Â¦'Â¦
Another thing about this glen was Its
popularity. It seemed to be more popular
with the people than : a. gob of ~ molasses
Â¦with "flies. There were so many campers
that they just tied their tents together in
groups and rows. There was no room to
stick tent pins. : 'Â¦"-Â¦ . .Â¦'.Â¦'
In spite of all the Gooks' care about tak-
ing colds they got one apiece before long.
Heaven sent 'em. This was the way of it.
Nature, as well as the rest of us, has
been getting Eastern ideas of late and the
summer storm is becoming more regular*
The first night that the camp was started
there came a soaker. It filled all the fam
ily Â¦wash tubs,'' soaked the tents, soaked
ihe bedding and it "soaked the Gooks.
They got up, splashed round in the mud
and tried to build a fire, instead of stay

erally dirty appearance of things and the
large-sized cold. The cold did not bother
them as much as it did or might have
done others, for the Gooks used no more
handkerchiefs when they had colds than
at any. other time.-
Hippocrates Gook, though, had ad
vanced ideas and brought home from the
city next evening a wonderful contriv
ance of rags a-nd wire, which was adver
tised to be better than a Turkish bath as*
a method of curing colds, la grippe and
other ills requiring calorific sanitation.
There being but one tent there was no
room in it to set up the thermopathetic
healer, so Hippocrates took it away
through the surrounding forest of grease
wood and poison oak to a secluded spot,
which was over two hundred feet from the
nearest camp. Hera he set up the little
tentlike contrivance within which he was
to take the vapor bath, lit the gasoline
lamp to heat it, opened the camp stool
on. which he was to sit, disrobed hurried
ly and crawled Inside. Just as he had
finished tying the strings around his neck
to keep in the heat he heard giggling girl
voices coming toward him- He grabbe*
I tallow candle in a lamp chimney for a

nor exclusive,' nevertheless had a whole
some horror of the various epidemic, con
tagious and automobile nuisances which
the campers brought, each year, and each
and all had good excuses to save them
selves from having to lodge the Gooks.
Pluvius worked till he was black In the
face and Pa Gook returned to the family
to find them in open mutiny. It ended by
their spending the night in the .stable,
covered with horse blankets and hay.
The morning was one of those beautiful
things that makes you say: "Oh, what so
rare as a day in June!" The men of the
family -went back to camp to find fifteen
cows standing on what had been the tent
and busily engaged in eating onions, pota
toes and cabbage out of the box that was
used as a pantry.
But anybody that would camp in the
-'glen was not to be discouraged by a lit
tle thing like that. The tent was raked
out of the mud; various articles of domes
tic and personal utility were dried in the
sun and at night there was nothing to be
noticed out of the way except the gen-
riiE
4of tents with their occupants running out
to see what caused his yells, all around
him a buzzing yellow fog of hornets. Into
the tent he rushed. The hornets found
more fuel to feed their wrath. The inside
of the bath cabinet seemed full of hor
nets and they devoted themselves impar
tially to the whole Gook family, and as
each Gook ran out he, she or it instlnct
â¢ Ively ran to a neighboring tent for pro
tection. Now.' it is said 'that -a bee can
sting but once, and then he bursts his
stinger and dies of grrief. or something,
but a hornet ain't built that way. He is
a native son of the woolly West. He is
rigged out ' to fight . his way through a
hard crowd any time and when he sticks
his stinger in he just pulls* It out again
and goes for another place. â
The rest is too awful to tell. Fifteen
families moved away from the hated spot
and the Gooks and hornets spent the rest
of the summer in a war. to the death for
the possession of the glen.
A bee line is the shortest possible
distance, between given points. A hornet
line is considerably shorter. That was the
kind of line that Hippocrates struck for
camp. He passed the girls, flying down
the road, wearing nothing but the vapor
bath cabinet. Down past the hundreds
the vapor bath carefully and' walked Into
the brush.- crouching to conceal himself.
As he got into the edge of the brush he
tripped and fell backward. Heavens!
what was it! He felt as though a dozen
knives ; had \ stuck ' clear into . his bones.
There was a buzzir.g sound' and he saw
himself surrounded with thousands of

Hid safely midst the rippling oats.
In unmarred domesticity,*
The browsi quail with her brood he notes,
And envies their felicity.
For him alone each blade and flower
A spell of glorious witchery weaves;
He revels in their passing hour.
And when they go 'tis he that grieves.
And those who, ever climbing high,
Only at last their dreams to miss.
He entertains as they pass by
With some brief nonsense such as this.

between tales of bloodshed King VH1+
11am let slip a little of his own story.
Born where the sound of the waves lures
lads to the mast, he followed the sea.
Strange lands were visited and adventures
piled thick and fast. Of course there was
a "glrl.waltlng for himâ a little French girl
with the starched Erlttany cap on her
head and the salt glow of Brittany red
dening her cheeks. One day William
sailed home to make her his wife and
found her wed to another. So he knocked
about on land and sea and at last shipped
as a baker on a French man-of-war.
When his ship put Into San Francisco in
'49 William deserted, took hi3 dose of tha
gold diggings and finally drifted to Lagu-'
nitas. there to become king to the most
lawless bands of woodchoppers th!3 side
of the Hartz Mountains.
King William says he is 74. but 4 he Is
still as tough as an osH Knot and chops
enough wood to satisfy his meager want3.
As long as he lives he will be king of tha
canj*on over which murder spreads Its
wings and broods.
How many men have been hurried Into
eternity in Lagunitas canyon not even
King William knows. "Mon Dieu! I havo
lost ze count of them," he says.
Will Lagunitas one day demand tha
king of the canyon to slake her thirst?

that keeps a man from harm."

â¢ It not to set a life on payday. . What sliÂ«
ITT Is more than passing strange that
II Lag-unltas, once queen of our nelgh
11 boring canyons, should have been the
scene of eo many murders. Stranger
etÂ£U that very few of the dark deeds have
been noised abroad. But strangest of
alL that every once In so often a wood
chopper' Â¦ life pays the penalty of the
fa.TiÂ«Â»n timber. It Is as though it were
measured, by rule and line â the life of a
human being for the lives of a certain
number of. trees.
There Is *nÂ« man â¢who has the secrets
of thÂ© canyon under lock and, key In hla
breast. That man Is William Tique,
called by the woodchoppers "King Wil
liam of Lagunltas."
"Volla," cays King William, "Lagunltaa
has her pay day, too. Mon Dieu. she
have zÂ© one big thirst for bloodl - I hear
her, I hear her call and- 1 know sure some
one going to die. For why she de

watch very closely. By and by three men
already dead. Zen I know how much
trees ehe give for one life. ; Some time
leetle more, some time leetlÂ© less, but
most time I make za right guess when
man must die."
King William computes his death rate
by distance, not time. He does not
reckon by the months, but by the miles.
Almost Invariably his computations are
correct. Some one is found either dead
or missing, as he predicts. And in
Lagunltas the missing and the dead are
akin. Life Is valued less than a plug of
tobacco. * '\-* y '~ Â¦i-"w-"
The last time that King William heard
the voice of the canyon crying for blood
French Pete answered Â¦ the summons.
"Some one die pretty soon," King Wil
liam raid, and not many days afterward
a woodchoppcr called French Pete was
found murdered. The supposed assassin,
a fellow woodchopper, was caught and
tried, but hl3 guilt was not pro\*cn.
According to Mr. Stedman, who for
over thirty years has been official for
ester of that section of Marin County,
King William Is the most honest, law
abiding woodchopper that ever swung an
ax In Lagunitas. Mr. Stedman says
that King William never has a finger In
the upJy Oceds. though he always knows
Â¦what is going on. He is of the wood
choppers, yet a creature apart. They fear
and respect King William.
Mr. Stedman declares that murders un
told have been committed In Lagunltas
of which the world knew not The kill
ing of French Pete crept out because
Miss Stedinan. Indignant and excited over
the affair, spread the report In Ban
Rafael. Then for the first time the long
era ct Justice groped Its way throuch the
of romance. The world, with the fever
of gold In Its veins, passed by William
Tlque and his canyon. . Then the day
came when it found them out.
Â¦ "Magniflque," simple William had said,
and pitched camp in the canyon.
"Ah!" fcaid shrewd Capital when its eya
fell on Lagunitas. Capital stroked Its
chin, did a little figuring and the doom
of Lagunltaa was sealedâ for so much per
cord.
The woodchoppers came. For many
years they were few In number and
worked intermittently. Slowly and surely
the forest was shorn of, its stately 'trees.
Even In the early days they were an un
usually surly, troublesome lot, those
woodchoppers. They gave their employ
ers so much trouble, they were so quick
to shed blood, so slippery to catch, that
periodically the whole gang would be dis
missed and a fresh start made. But the
germ of -strife was in Â¦ th^ air and each
new squad' only turned â¢ another blood
stained page in the story of the unwrit
ten, unpunished murders.
King William's ax swung with the first
woodchoppers who felled' in : the canyon.
iHe . earned hJs royal . title In those early
shadows of. Lagunitas, but the culprit
slipped through Its fingers.
"We notice a man is missing," says Mr.
Stedman, "but we can find no proof of
murder, so the crime goes unpunished.
Xot long ago I found a body In the brush,
hacked beyond recognition. We burled
the body and that was the last of It.
KingT William Is straight, but must of the
rest are a bad lot." *
King William's hut Is In a tiny canyon
that timidly clasps' hands with its big.
sister canyon, Lagunitas. "I cannot look
Lagunitas in ze face," he says naively,
"since zey spoil her. So I come here
after work and live by myself. Long
time ago old Mr. Malllard, the boss of all
zis land, he come and say, 'King William,
you keep zis place so long you "live, and
his son, Joe Maillard, say ze same."
For almost forty years King William
has wielded his twin scepters, the saw
and ax. over Lagunltas. The' hireling of
others, his strong blows have - helped
bring the canyon from Its high estate.
To-day It lies with its bosom bared by the
woodchoppers' ax, . scarred Â¦. by a track,
curling around It like a serpent, over
which the timber Is shipped. The waters
drip listlessly in myriad teardrops . and
meander through the canyon. ;' *.â¢Â¦'Â¦
In the elder days, giant" trees locked
branches above Lagunltas and the creek
tumbled briskly over bowlders or tripped
lightly over pebbles. Slender ferns
swayed gracefully forward to catch their
reflections in the* clear pools. But that
was before the need or greed of man
made havoc of the works of nature.
William Tlque saw Lagunltas in the
pride of its strength and beauty. Its wild
loveliness fascinated him and ' he made
pause In a life that had been already

with clothing, hampering every movement

that If Lyons, by signing the bill as he
promised, declares himself on the side -of
the corporation, he will lose his. chance
of the Senatorship. He tells his trouble
to fielma and she, true to her principles,
decides that her husband , would commit
an actual wrong <n fulfilling a mere prom

and for her what she terms a larger ob

great opportunities to lead others away

"The Religion of Democracy."
According to the, Rev. Charles Fergu
con "The spirit of the age Is saying to Its
children: Have faith. Make yourself at
home. This is your own â¢ house. The laws
are made for you, gravitatidn and the
chemical affinities: not you for them. No
cne can put you out of the house- Stand
up; the ceiling Is hlgrh."
In order that the children of the age
may stand up there is needed for them a
sew faith. To that faith Mr. Ferguson
rives the title, "The Religion of Democ
racy": and by way of preaching It has
jrublishod a volume bearing the title/ He
cays: "The thing that has been' most
steadily desired since the world began is
not money, nor long life, nor pleasant
pastlmes. but a guaranteed Godâ a God
with solid institutional backing, advertis-.
Ing himself in distinct terms and plainly
discriminating between deserving persons
and nations, and the undeserving. It Is
this longing for an unquestionably re
spectable and plain-spoken God that has
been the stronghold of all the monarchies,
aristocracies and tccleslocracies of the
world. The privileged classes have- kept
their privileges an<? have ruled the people.
not only or chiefly on account of their su
perior wisdom and strength,' but because
they have been supposed to be the special
backers and sbokesmen of God."
The author goes on to say the "re-
quaint the Reader with many things that
are not usually known to every Angler;
and I shall leave gleanings and" observa
tions enough to be made out of the expe
rience of all that love and practice this

â¢ The Black Terror. .
The latest novel of contemporary Rus
sia is "The Black f Terror." by John K.
Leys. The author gives us a wildly Im
probable tale, but so plausibly written
that the reader can bear him no grudge
for his fanciful flights. The story con
cerns a young Englishman, an architect,
residing in Russia, who Is wonderfully

ing the castle of a Russian nobleman
whose cruelty has marked him for a vic
tim by the* Nihilists. The nobleman [iÂ»
spirited away, and the Englishman, in
love -with \he haughty daughter of the
Russian, takes up. the search for him.
The Nihilists are looking for bigger game
than" the Russian nobleman, and decida
that if he will allow his daughter- to wed
the Englishman, and further, if the Eng
lishman "wijl render them assistance, the
nobleman shall go free. Counting upon
the striking resemblance of the architect
very young man such a reception may
fairly be called remarkable. Critics have
classed this story as a pagan counterpart
to "Quo Vadis" : and have compared it
with Canon Farrar's famous book also.
In reality, however, it stands alone In Its

The editors of Ainslee's Magazine de
vote the August number to the younger
writers pt American fiction. Those repre
sented fare Stephen Crane, Harry Still
well Edwards, Brand Whitlock, John'D.
Rarry and Eugene Wood. Stephen Crane's
"The Kicking Twelfth" is a battle story
and the vivid picture of the bloody field
which he has presented must convince the
reader anew that American literature has
cause for regret In the untimely end of
this author. Harry StiUwell Kdwards"
"The Stirring Up of Billy Williams" Is a
delightfully humorous story of the South.
Brand Whitlock, whom we have known
only for his strong political storifs. In
"The Old House Across tho Way" offers
.a most moving and tender tale. John D.
Barry's "At the Shrine of the Idol" is a
finished product of literary art. The
reader's curiosity will bo piqued to know
just which celebrated English author la
the "idol" In this very interesting story.
Eugene Wood is as strong and naturat
as ever in a mining center story called
"That About Lnura Hornbaker." Alto
gether Alnsleo's for August contains some
captivating fiction, while the special
articles in it are of the^usual distinction.
Among the latter are: "A Talk With
President Krugcr," by Allen Sangree:
"Missionary Work in China." by John
Fryer, professor of Oriental Language
and Literature in the University of Cali
fornia: "Mark Twain on the Lecture Plat
form." by Will M. Clemens: and "Gillette.
Actor and Playwright." by Richard Duffy.
Besides there are two very humorous con
tributions,. '.'The Plague of Flies." and
"The Defense of Plagiarism." A lyric by
miss Carman and a Jolly ballad by ,Hol
man F. Day arc the most notable verse
contributions to the magazine.
The Midsummer Fiction number of Mc-
Clure's Magazine, with a cover by Louis'
Loch, suggesting by its rich, warm color
ing the lassitude of the season, and with
a strong list of .well-known adepts In the
art of story telling, produces at once a
pleasing impression. To this number
Frank H. Spearman contributes the first
of a new series of railway stories, telling
of the exciting race of a train of Yellow
stone Park excursionists with a runaway
"freight." Jack London, the young Call
fornian. has In this ifssrue a talo of the
perilous journey of a Klondike miner and
his Indian wife to obtain relief for a
starving camp. This story is Imaginative
in the highest degree, and possesses strik
ing local color and extraordinary pathetic
force. Another strong story Is "A Bill
from Tiffany's." by Joslah Flynt. the
well-known explorer of tramp and crimi
nal life, and Francia Walton. The Ufa of
metropolitan policemen and -of profes
sional thieves Is graphically portrayed:
and there is a keen relish In the account
of the means by which Detective Charley
Allnlck secured funds for the purchase of
his wife's jewels. The relations of "guns"
(members of the thieving guild) with one
another are treated in a highly Illuminat
ing manner. Equal If not greater Interest
attaches to one or two stories founded-on
factâ to W.' D. Hulbert's etory of a Michi
gan porcupine, : with Illustrations by A.
Radclyffe Diigmore, whose studies of
mocking birds and other animals have
attracted much attention: and also to
Lieutenant Commander Glllmore's ac
"count, beginning In this number, of tho
"extraordinary â¢ hardships ; of hla party In
the wilds of Luzon, where a brutal death
more than - once seemed ; imminent. The
illustrations to this article are by W. R.
Leigh, and are marvelously realistic. The
, number also contains attractively, illus-
tcrcsting datn connected with, the'.r life
and habits, and the whole work indicates
the hand of a true-sportsmanâa lover of
the rodâand fair play for the fish, with
healthful recreation for. the fisherman,
Tho host proof of the author's success is
that you cannot read many chapters with-,
out feeling a dfgire to close up business
for a few tlays and take a try with the
rod yourself jwhile the days are long and
the fish game. (Published by D. Appleton

EXCITING LIFE SCENES OF STEPHEN CRANE. JOURNALIST.
GRANE was not an. eccentric Char
acter. Many people have said .that
he was. It was even told In print
in this city : that he was a drug
taker. Such stories were'absurd. He was
merely the combination of clean, fine ~
youth with genius. When one writes "fine
youth" of Stephen Crane the expression
is qualified. He was never physically
strong. His greatest eccentricity was his
habit of all night work. I never saw him
wholly at bodily ease. He was not n per
sistent worker, because his bodyâ a body
which suffered from the constant '-.drain-'*
ings of an intensely active mind â was ever
too weak to bear continuous labor. His
brain never rested. ,, '
Yet .when emergencies, arose 90 also did'.
Crahe. He was a correspondent on. one
New York newspaper during the war with
Spain. I. was a correspondent on another
Xew York newspaper. On June 23 I was
told that a battle would occur the next -
day. I nsked Crane if he intended to go ;
to the front./ It was insufferably' hot, :
and we had all learned to distrust rumors.
He decided not to go.: I was amazed by
1..H apparent indolence. ,1 went to the ~
battle. and was badly hurt by. a bullet.
\VhÂ«n I regained consciousness, hours
after the light had ended, one of the first
faces I saw was that of Stephen Crane.
The day was hot. The. thermometerâ hart
there been such an Instrument In that
God , forsaken and" man Invaded wllder
ness-r-would have shown a temperature of
something like 100 degrees. Yet Stephen
Craneâ and, mind you, he was there: in
the interest of a rival newspaperâ took
the dispatch which I -managed to write
five or six miles to the coast and cabled
it for me. He had to walk, for he could
get no: horse or mule. Then he rushed
about, in the heat and arranged with a
number of men to bring a stretcher up
from the coast and carry me back on it.
He was proVaWy as tired then as a man
coultl be and Still walk. But he trudged
back from the coast toVthe Held hospital
where I was lying artdisaw to It that 'I
was properly conveyed 'to the coaat.^^
One day In 1S90 a young man came to my
office with" a letter of Introduction. He
was thin â almost cadaverous. .He wanted
work and got it. His article-^-written for
a ridiculously low pneeâ on tcnomfm
house .fire panics. -was one .of the beÂ«t
things that he cr any other man ever d'd.
It was followed by other strikingly strong
stories. - - , ,
One day he said to mo, most modestly:
"I have written some verse." He handed
me a package* of manuscript. '> The- next
day I left. the package on an elevated rail
road train. I never told him about it. for
within twenty-four hours I had;recovere.l
it from the lost property office of the Man
hattan L. The manuscript was that of
"The Black Riders, which had a tre
mendous voetun In Kngland. -
Â¦ We were both .members of a club made
up of writers. The best part of Its fur
nishings was a great open fireplace. Four
or five of us sat before it one night and
Crane read us parts of a story full of
fighting. It was "The Red Badge of Cour
age." Afterward, when wo 'had really
seen fighting together, I marveled because
his stories of nctual battle weje less re
alistic thnn his descriptions of imaginary
conflicts in this book. It was that faculty
which would have made of Crane a great
novelists He had an accurate and logical
imagination.
An episode in his life Â¦was unpleasant.
He went to a place known as the Broad
way Garden to write a descriptive article
for n certain newspaper.- -He was deiliite-
Iy assigned ta this work as a soldier might
be to guard duty. tA woman ' whom he
met thereâ he met her as a part of, his
workâ was a few moments later grossly
Insulted by a policeman. Crane^ raised all
kinds of trouble for u e officer,- and In
turn was arrested find bothered' himself.
He took it like a man. He accepted the
exceedingly unpleasant notoriety with no
comment except that which he made in
court.' -, .. Â¦ . Â¦-.;Â¦Â¦ Â¦ - Â¦ ...
'.. In- losing Crane America lost one of her
most promising young writers. But his
friends lost more. They, lost a chap whom
they all knew to.be a real man as well as
a talented acquaintance.

Written in Gordon Hall, Tientsin, while Boxer bullets pelted day
and night. This is certainly the most vivid pen picture of the suffer
ings of the three hundred -women and children, who from June 13 until
July 4 writhed under the shadow of death. It was intended as a last
message in event of their extermination and, penciled in the heat of
agony, ft pulsates -with the horror of their awful situation. Miss Fahr
was the only woman who kept a diary during those days of torture.

Is no rest. Who knows what the morrow
means for us?
JUNE 15.â So a lifetime of agony can
really be lived In a day. It is night In
Gordon Hall, in Gordon Hall, where three
hundred' women and children crouch for
.safety. Over, in that corner a mother
sobs a cradle song to her fretful *baby.'

mirthless laugh that clutches on the
heartstrings. Some sit with wUe star

JUNE16.â Again the fires are raging in
the native city. The flames look like
writhing devils ; to me. Gordons-Hall is
growing more quietâ the first hysteria is
passed. ( Are- these hollow-eyed, wan faces
those that smiled such a short time ago?
Mattresses are spread on the floor, but
sleep will not come to the women: only
the children toss in fitful slumber. Al
ways, always the sounds of ilring. Oh, to
die at once and end it all! To-night I for

watching for the help that seemed already
too late.
It had been decided by the men of Tien
tsin that the lives of the women and chil- jj
dren were no longir safe within the city.
If they fell into the handn cf the Boxers
their fate would have been more horrible
than ary would ever have cared to hear..
So the helpless ones were . to .be sent
away under a guard of marines or Cos
sacks in the almost hopeless effort to
reach protection of the merr*cf-war.
If the party was attacked in such man
ner a? to make, defeat certain, the women
and children were to be killed by their
own guards.
That was why there were strange, pity
ing Jooks on the faces of the men of Tien-4
tsin when they looked upon their women
and children.
The decision which they had reached,
involving the possible slaughter of all who
were dear to them, was yet one of the
mest merciful judgments ever made by
any jury of men.
Knowing all of this, feeling it as only a
Â¦woman In a far away land could feel It,
Miss Fahr stood in the belfry of the tower
on Gordon Hall and looked and looked
over the level plain that shone In the
burning heat.
A dust In the distant horizon line, dark
with moving men. showed that the sol
diers were comingâ Boxers, Imperials or
allies? Was it torture, death or life that
was being carried to them by that little
thin line?
The most powerful glasses had all been
stolen by the servants when they left,
and the pair which she had could not dis
tinguish the men.
At last there, there It wasâ the flag, the
flag! the one flag In the world which sha
longed to see.
In one of the quiet rooms of the hotel
she sat on her trunk which had come
from China.
In her hand the little diary to which she
had confided the horror of those days
when three hundred women and children
had crouched week after week, surround
ed by the allied soldiers who were to
slaughter them If the Boxers conquered.
As she read from the diary to a sten

Two years ago Miss Fahr had gone to
China as a teacher, when that country
was calling for enlightenment and prog
ress. China needs for a while a more
earnest and practical lesson In civiliza
tion than could be taught by gentle
minded'women. '
The more horrible scenes of torture and
suffering. Miss Fahr has omitted Inten
tionally from her diary.
Miss Fahr had seen the coming of the
trouble months before the envoys at Te
king. They had been lulled by the smooth
stories of the people of the palace,
where all was serene In the tranquillity
which Confucius taught so well, while
around them rose the angry tide that cut
them off from the stores of safety.
American men risked their lives to save
this girl and her, companions. LIve3 and
dollars well risked for the Joy ,thcy
brought to those hopeless prisoners who
were asking only the boon of a merciful
death from the hands of their husbands,
fathers and frlend3.
The lesson of civilization must bo taught
to those who would excel In refined bar
barism, i ' Â¦Â¦ Â«. .- .
To see the gratitude of one who has
fscaped from such 'lends; to read her
own story, writton in that spirit of truth
which comes when facing death, makes
an argument that settles the question of
what our policy should be In China.

rrT has been discovered that comfort,
utility and general convenience are not
ii incompatible with high art. Comfort
Is the essential point, but art is its
twin Foster.
the artistic points are cozy corners, built
into the windows or elsewhere, plenty of
palms and curios in*the decorations. Of
course. In some of the modern and ele
gant homes, in spite of the resemblance
to a living-room, the hall is simply used
as a passageway and then furnished in
any preferred style. Often in this case
the paneled walls are filled with niches
for vases or statues. The furniture of
this kind of a hall should consist of
straight-backed clalrs, benches and the
Inevitable oaken chest, plain or carved.
In small halls, where expensive decora
tions are beyond the limit of the owner's
purse, a few good pieces of furniture are
the only objects required. Xever over
crowd a hall so that In passing through
one must wind his awkward way through
a circuit of furniture. Such overcrowding
gives a parvenue air to even costly fur
nishings. And the fewer the colors used
In a hall the more restful la the effect
of the eye. When neutral tones are used
the carpet may contrast In color with
draperies, cushions, etc. When the walls
are simply paneled in oak or walnut, or
paneled In a quiet tone, such as gray
or white, the carpet may contrast In color
with the draperies and chair coverings.
For instance, in an oak-paneled room
crimson curtains or draperies and chair
coverings may be used with a dull green
carpet, or with one of the dark blue pat
terns In subdued tints; or the color
scheme may be reversed and green hang
ings and chair coverings combined with
a plain crimson carpet. ;
The Colonial Btyle of furnishing halls Is
extremely popular, both in the East and
West. With this style go highly polished

chairs and antique ornaments.

The Japanese fad has rather run its day,
(hough It Is found occasionally in single
rooms or perhaps one corner of a hall

Individuality Is shown to a large ex
tent In the furnishing of rooms, particu
larly of halls. As an example there Is the
hall in Mrs. C. Gross' residence on Green

yet comfortable in ev*ry detail. By rea

be of use as library, sitting room, recep

One corner Is fitted up a3 a library and
decorated with Indian and Mexican bas

other corner has the piano, with a tea

with valuable rugs. The celling Is pan

To sum up. It may be truly said that It
would be the height of absurdity for us
to depend upon any stylo or fashion for
the decorations of our homes. Sound Judg
ment and good sense should bÂ« used in
planning a house's interior; the general
appreciation and adoption of artistic dec
orations should be colored by these quali
ties. Depend upon it. the decoration oC
a home Is not a mere thing of fashion, but
a constant recurring pleasure. Put in
your homes your own original Ideas, what
you desire to see about you. In short, let
vour home be a reflection of yourself.
The climatic conditions out ( here are so
different from those In Eastern cities that
we cannot follow exactly the same styles
of decoration that prevail there. For one
thing the Eastern country houses are usu
ally furnished as we furnish our town
homes. Their long winter calls for heavier
furniture, while we can use the light,
styles all the year round.
There are many less palatial homes In
this city and across the bay which are
strictly artistic In furnishings, though the
outlay for the decorations was In no senso
large. One of the prettiest homes tha
writer has ever entered is the abode of a
young couple In moderate circumstances.
The drawing-room is In tans and browns,
with one or two palms on tabarets, a ma
hogany plano\and three or four good pic
tures on the walls. The hall. In sage
green. Is just large enough for an oaken
chest, a hanging hatrack and a carved
Chair. The bedrooms are In oak or whlta
and gold. The whole effect of the tiny
home Is charming.
Nearly all of the furniture, draperies and
ornaments were Imported. The halls are
of the massive order, with magnificent
carved chairs and benches. Statues and
rare palms appear at the different turns
In the passageways. The floors of the
reception hall are covered with Persian

THE presence of a great unrest was
felt in the Valley of Ho Tal. Up on
the hillsid* the mission of the Jesuit
Fathers wa? as tranquil and as dig

the quiet of apprehension.
Presently at onÂ© of the windows there

past fantastic bridges, gaudy pa
godas and the " grotesque temples
of tho , .neighboring villages. then
out into the illimitable plain, with
its network of canals, where .the
stretches of brown fallow showed a
dreary, clean-cut horizon, unbroken by
tree or hedge-row. Toward the Vising- of
the sun they slept, and. when it was light
they breakfasted and started on. ' Jour
neying en . they * passed the sail-carts of
the rice' farms, with' canvas spread and
driven by the s wind. Here and there were
barges riding on wheels through the ca
nals. ThÂ»t^was all-ran endless waste of
the . same, along the treeless level. At
first there v.'as no trouble and they passed
unmolested through the groups of boat
men and villagers, simple folks unaware
that their; country was at war with the
allied powers .of the world. But a day
and a night brought them to a place of
scowling faces and ominous mutterings.
It t was when. the>v turned from the great
waterway and struck . across .the-, plain
toward Shanghai.. At every village, the
scowls grew blacker, and the coolie crept
silently at the heels of his master, ner
vous and v/atchfu'l. Being refused a
lodging Felix grew, afraid to ask and they
took turns at sleeping In the open fields,
or In the cooler nights under some friend

might come the outbreak of the rebellious

settlement of the valley of Good-to-look
at. To him had been intrusted the mess
age for the commander of the French
squadron at Shanghai and through him
was to come the assistance which was to
save the # mission if it were possible. He
knew that his was no easy task; that the
way lay through a country wild with riot
ing" and nervous with the breath of hor
rible crimes. He knew that there .was
little hope of threading a safe .path
through the perils' of the section through
which he would have to pass, and- that
the uncertainty of life carried with it
the horrors of a -death unspeakable. -But
Felix Marchand was 22 and no coward.
As the last of the red sun sunk outof
eight behind the rice fields Felix set out,
close at his heels the servant of the mis
sion, Chung Foo, with a bag of provisions
on his back. At the hridge where the
' canal was widest they met a tall, serious
yellow man. It was Wong Kai. With a
word and a noJ Felix passed him by, but
the slant eyes watched long after the
careless good-by. /
. "Me sabe he go." mused Wong,
-"Mishee FJe>Â»Â£~ go Shanghai. "\3~ong.Kal
', go too. Mishee Flelix goo' man. No likee
see go dead." Then when the sun. was
â¢ not ct all and the dark had settled 'over
with tireless ' eyes watched beside him.
Presently there were wild sounds off
toward the dark line of horizon . and
Chung Foo sprang to hif feet. Physical
exhaustion >had rendered' Felix insensible
to the danger of abandonment "and he
slerJt soundly. The words ,of the coolie
reached his ears but not hte senses, as
Chung Foo hastily muttered in ; pigeon
English: "You stay; mo go look- see. No
come back you run likee devil. Big sword
man come, me sabe alle day, makee fol
low."
The little yellow man darted off, glid
ing through the grasses, and Felix slept
on. Roused/ aften how long a time he
knew not. by the most fiendish succession
of heathen yells ever given vent to-out
side the limits of the infernal regions,
Felix leaped to his feet, instantly awake
to the perils of his position, and found
Chung Foo missing. The momentary sus
picion of treachery against his faithful
servant came x back to him as a bitter re
proach a few minutes later, when the
real situation unfolded its horrors to his
realization. The. Boxers had laid hold.of
the devoted coolie and were torturing him
with the fury of disappointment. They
had sought his master. , Peering from the
embankment, Felix beheld a sickening
sight. By. the light of torches, a dozen
howling fiends circled around the body of
poor Chung Foo, lashing him with whips
and prodding him with sticks, burning
him with ' flaming torches and throwing
to assist the dying coolie appeared to him,
he hastily picked up the lighter pack up
on which he had slept, and cautiously
moved across the waste toward a strag
gling field of corn where he hoped to gain
a shelter for the ' hour^of approaching
daylight. Heartsick,' weary and footsore
he dragged himself into the scant thick
et of- low growth just as the straggling
beams of the sun crept over the desolate
waste and lighted up the land of his foes.
Breathless and with a whirling head he
lay like a hunted animal close to the
ground, eachwhisk of. the -wind through
the drying leaves of corn bringing a-mo
ment of agonized anticipation. NerveSj
overwrought, and utterly exhausted phys
ically. Felix fell asleep and slept deeply.
"The red sun faded into, pale yellow, and
then beat down a white heat. Felix
awoke feeling cramped. He attempted to
rise, but found he could not. His hand3
were bound. His dazed brain began to
comprehend. He had been thus bound
and left to die of starvation. There was
a discordant sound beside him. Felix
heard it and "understood starvation was
not to be the only torture. It was to be
the terrible punishment v of- the parrot, of
which he had. heard. Hands and feet.se
curely bound.'he couid not move, and to
his belt was chained a monster green bird.
The fiends had sought him out while ho
slept, and had done this thing .while he
lay senseless in* the stupor of exhaustion.
Great beads i of perspiration came out
on Felix's brow.- His face was white and
drawn. Presently he would grow hungry,
and the birdâ would eat. In the horror
of it* all, withi the pitiless white, rays of
the sun beating down in his face, Felix
cried out,', one f agonized, despairing cry
that lost itself on the shimmering hot air.
Then he lay still.' The bird hopped upon
his breast, cocked one eye and looked
around curiously, then it settled the gaze
of two round waiting eyes upon Felix's
face, and-it too, was still. The lagging
minutes crept; into hours, the two round
eyes still watched and waited. It^Â» could
not be much longer, then the sharp beak
and the black' claws would be at work;
theTway the parrot gazed with those
round, red-rimmed eyes into his own told
Felix what would be the first work of/the
sharp" beak.-. In the horror of it all he
nightmare had been with him while ho
slept, and he had not forgotten, "^e
thought for the moment he had gone nyw;
and expected to hear the discordant cry
of the bird, or feel It pluck at ht3 shirt.
He opened his eye3 again, and then he
tried to move his hands. To hia surprise
he succeeded, though his whole body was
aching, and stiff. Sinking back, ho tried
to think it all out. and gave it up. H a
felt his brain going, then there Was a feel
ing of something at his wrist, a hand was
rubbing it. Slowly he gathered his senses
and looked up. A dark form carao be
tween him and the stars.
"Whashe mallah? Mishee Flelix ffeel
blettah?" It was Wong Kaiâ Wons Kai
who had followed through the days and
nights. . sleepless and faithful, until ha
had lost them two days before, and even
now he had traced Felix through the
trails of his pursuers, and past the muti
lated body of Chung Foo to the patch of
corn, and he had lain low until the last
sound of the rabble had died away.
All day they waited in the corn, resting
and sleeping. Wong Kai had brought
with him food, and they ate. To all Felix's
heartfelt words of gratitude the stoio
Wong Kal made no reply, except that ha
had followed of his own free- will, because
he "no likee see Mlshee Flelix go dead."
But when Felix made him lie down to
sleep, and bound a wet handkerchief over
the yellow, aching forehead there was <^Â«Â»
beaming, peaceful look of gratified amf.
tion from Wong's* flat features, and thÂ«
yellow man slept.
They had moved through to the far end
of the cornfield, leaving no trace of their
footsteps, lest the fiends should, coma
again to witness the agonies of tbfelr vic
tim. But they saw no trace of. them, and
when it was dusk they started forward.
They traveled fast, being refreshed with
their long day of rest, and the morning
sunshine found them within sight of thÂ«
city of Shanghai. At noontime as thÂ»
commander of the French squadron
lunched at his table a message cams to
him. It was to the effect that a messen

Until altr.ost the beginning ot the pres

tian countries was that not only the earth
and man but the whole cosmos began to
exist about six thousand to seven thou
sand years ago; furthermore, that all was
made at once without natural process,
?nnd has remained substantially, un
changed ever since. This is the old doc
trine of the supernatural origin and sub
stantial permanency of the earth and Its
features. Among intelligent and espe
cially scientific men this doctrine, even in
the eighteenth century, began to be ques
tioned, although not -publicly; for in 1751
Buffon was compelled by the Sorbonne to
retract certain views concerning the ago
of the earth, published- in - his "Natural
History" in 1743. Remnants of the old be
lief lingered even into the early^ part of
the present century, and may even yet be
found hiding away in some of the remote
corners of civilized ' countries. - But -with
the birth of geology, and especially
through the work of Hutton In Scotland.
Cuvier in France and William Smith in
England, the much greaterâ the incon
ceivably greatâ antiquity of the earth and
the origin of its present forms, by gradual
changes which are still going on, was gen
erally acknowledged. Indeed, as already
eald, this is the fundamental idea of geol
ogy, without which it could not exist as
a science.â Professor Joseph Le Conte of

claim to have "invented"â if on* may use

The great antiquity of China would lead

tr.e fan has played an important part in
Bl'i the religious ceremonies of India from
the remote ages. Indeed the faithful In
dian tells us how one of Us daughters,
a handmaid of Buddha, waved palm leaves
round the god to create a current of air
about him. There is no doubt whatever
that the ortpinal fan was simply n palm
lenf. which became more ornate and cov
ered with decorations as the time went
on. The first authentic mention of his
torical fans comes to us from the royal
crchives of Chir.tt. where it Is proclaimed
the right of the Emperor alone to use a
fan of pure sold, ornamented with the
royal scarlet and purple. The nobles of
his court us*Â»d white fans, while yellow

in Paris*, where they may cost anything
from 2 francs to 10.000. Nowadays It is
computed that the manufacture of
fans in Paris alone Is lO.OOO.OOO francs per
annum Perhaps the most expensive of
all fans were those used about the time
of Louis XIV. XV and XVI. Some of
these were painted on various fine skins,
or silks, with sticks of solid gold. Inlaid
with precious stones or carved moth'er
of-pearl. The painting's on many of these
fan? are historical in their value, the
world celebrated Watteau having painted
many, as did also the Spanish artist.
Cana de ArÂ»valo. and many other Italian
and French artists. One of the most ex
quisite fans- ever m*Â»de was used by Ma
rie Antoinette.; It was* of French manu
facture, composed of painted medallions
of chicken skJn. let into a design of price
less lacÂ»\ which was literally Incrusted
with jewels. The gold carved sticks had
the royal insignia of France on one side
in diamonds and pearls, while on the
other was the crest and arms of an Aus
trian grand duchess. Marie Antoinette's
rark before marriage.
Balzac characterizes this fan as the
handsomest of all famous fans. The paint
ed medallions alone were worth a fabulous
sum. and were painted by Le Flamand,
representing episodes In the life of Alex
ander the Great. This fan was presented
to Marie Antoinette by the city of Dieppe
on the occasion of the birth of the dau
phin in 17S5. The Justly celebrated fan of
the Pompndcur ivas one of the most won
derfulâand certainly one of the mest
costly â ever made. It is* of Italian origin.
Klpht or nine years were consumed In
maklner it. the whole cost being about
Â£6000. Each eectlon, in addition to the
priceless embroidery, was decorated with
a masterpiece of miniature painting.
From the lime of Queen Elizabeth's
rpign the dress of no fashionable lady en
grande tenue appears to have been com
plete In England without the addition of
a fan. Humor has it that her sisterâ
"Blooey Mary," the censort of Philip of
Spain â introduced it to this country, she
having learned its use from the Spanish
ladies In her court. At any rate. It ap
pealed greatly to Elizabeth, who Is paint
od with a round feather fan In her por
trait at Gorhamburg. while In the inven
tory taken In 1605 of her effects mention Is
made of twenty-seven fans. At this period
the fan was only known in two formsâ the
circular fan and the small folding fan,
which was invented In Japan. It had a
various number of blades, sometimes only
four, sometimes as many as eighteen, but
during the eighteenth century these in
creased to twerity-six or twenty-eight. A
fan much In fashion about the period of
Louis XIV waa the "evential brise," so
named because the f^n had no mounts,
but was simply made up of the stick,
which was elaborately carved;" painted or
decorated with finely cut leather work in
the shape of flowers'. A .very interesting
specimen of this period was exhibited' in
the collection of Mme. Duchatel in South
Kensington In 1S70. It was a. fan given to
Mme. de Grlgnart by her mother, Mme. de
Scvique. who describes it in one of her
letters an of the style known as Vernis
Martin, the subjects being a "Promenade"
and the "Toilette of Venux." These Ver
nis Martin fans are the most precious of
tho period, and to-day a fine specimen of
the class will command from Â£50 toÂ£100.
To inspire a spiritless race like this with
the desire to help itself is not the least
among the multitudinous trials of the
famine relief officer.. But there is an
other and still more trying test of that
much abused officer's patience. I refer,
of course, to the national habit of hoard
ing, which will fully account for quite
one-half of the incredible misery to which
these poor wretches are reduced In times
of scarcity.
The origin of the habit is, to say the
least, interesting. Unlike we Britishers,
the Hindoos have always been content to
give the best to their despotic rulers. WhITe
we in the west were laying the founda
tions of our parliaments and teaching our
rulers, by force when necessary, that they
ruled only by sufferance and from no in
herent divine right, the passive Hindoo
lay patiently groaning under the exac
tions of his native rajahs.
THE present struggle in South Africa
has done much to distract attention
from the fearful ravages of the In
dian famine. There Is. however, one
point In connection with this periodic
scourge which Britishers would do well
to bear in mind, says a prominent mem
ber of the Indian Civil Service in Pear
son's Weekly.
STARVING HINDOOS HOARD GOLD.
The horrible cruelties and extortions ot
these potentates are well known to every
student of Indian history. Nobody's per
son or property was secure from their
depredations, and the whole of Hlndostan
became one vast chamber of horrors. Then
it was that the Hindoo became a miser.
It was useless for him to invest his
money in horses, lands or beautiful dwell-
ing places; they could be too quickly torn
from him. He must concentrate his wealth
into the smallest possible space, and bury
it deep beyond the range of the reignine
Moguls, or the cut-throat Mahrattas' ra
pacity.
Hence It was that the Hindoo converted
all his belongings Into useless gold or sil
ver, and became the miser that he Is to
day, lor although the strong rule of the
white man has stayed the grasping hand
of the rajah, the habit of centuries has
been found less easy to grapple with and
the Hindoos are, to a man, misers in tha
most far-reaching sense of the word.
The actual figures of these centuries of
hoardingâ for it must not be forgotten
that probably fifty per cent ot the poor
wretches delay until too late the secret
of their hoarded riches, which are thus
lost, both to their families, and. indirect
ly, to India and the world at largeâ ara
astounding. * â¢
In 1SS2 the British Government tried to
get tola literally "burled treasure" into
circulation by offering abnormally high,
rates of interest, but habit was too strong
and the experiment was a complete fail
ure. A short time later it was reported
to the Royal Commission on Bimetallism
that during the previous half century
Â£130,000,000 in gold and Â£170,000.000 In silver
or Â£300,000,000 in all had been imported
into India.
Now. It Is a significant fact that while
India will greedily swallow any amount
of precious metal, she has never been,
known to systematically disgorge any.
Consequently it may fairly be assumed
that practically the whole of this huge
store of wealth was Imported In order to
replace money withdrawn from circula
tion. *
In passing It should be noted that the
total amount of coin circulating in tha
world at that time was estimated by Dr.
Soetbeer at Â£1.000.000.000. Hence. In tha
brief space of fifty years India was able to
bury practically onÂ»-thlrd of the world's
money. Just how much she has amass
ed in this way during the countless cen
turies of oppression under which her sub
ject races have groaned It is impossible)
to estimate.
The hoards generally take one of two
formsâ Jewelry or actual coin. The for
mer range from the familiar silver ban
gles of the poorer class Hindoo to tha
massive gold and Jeweled Idols of the rul
ing classes. This is considered by the
wily Hindoo to be the most satisfactory
form of saving. The Jewels pay no in
come tax. are pleasant to the eye, form
the daughter's dowry and are treasured
in each â¢family every whit as much as our
own heirlooms.
On the other hand, coins get out of data
and have been, known to depreciate in
valueâ the rupee, for instance. Although
their owners have no Intention of again
putting' them into circulation, they ara
nevertheless sharp enough to appreciate
this diminution in the value of their store.
. It is the same all over India. Tho
wealthiest merchants are frequently tha
smallest givers to their famine stricken
brethren.
Miss Rawlston confesses that tha
change makes her as nervous as a witch. !
"I can let my heart go pit-a-pat," she
says, "but I must control my hand." ThÂ«
leist fumbling .would spoil the whola
thing, for when one part goes wrong the
charm is lost, and everything goes at
sixes and sevens.

You will find in nearly every case of a
sudden hit of an unknown actor that hÂ«
has been working for years in road com
panies In some out-of-the-way place, stor
ing up a "bit of business" here, an Idea
of "make-up" there, a trick of elocution

Mind you, I am not underrating genius.
Some great general said that "Providence

perches on the'banner of the man who
works hardest and most intelligently and
who gets up earlier and goes to bed a
j little later than anybody else. This was
the case with Maud Adams, who "sud

night, after having played in San Fran

Julia Arthur made a sudden sensation
one day in New York at a matinee, after

Is no true artist. .The Procrustean method
of cutting off tbe head of a part or
stretching its feet to fit tho Iron Inflexi
bility of an actor's "personality" is a
brutality to art which is not condoned by
the fact of its sometime commercial suc
cess.
It is the contention of many who ar%
' concerned in the "business" of the theater
that ah actor who "conceals" his char
acter is harder, to establish to the knowl
edge of the public than one who is always
the same in different settings. Whether
this be true or not, It has no bearing upon
the accusation in which foreigners have
put us on the defense. The question of
commercial advantage has no more place
In a discussion of art than art in a con
vention of soap boilers.
It is undoubted that many of our suc
cessful stars are exhibitors rather than,
artists. But even In their case we will
often discover that If we trace them back
a little they have deserted their natural
quality cr versatility to prosecute a
specialty which has met with unusual
public favor. I don't think there is any
such thing as a "straight" part.
If there isn't seme salient point In a
character, It isn't worth playing. We are
perhaps all alike In big things, but In
.-^fionessentlals," perhaps as to' Immediate
"effect, but very essential in formation of
character or side lights upon It, we are aa
different as the marks on oui thumbs. *
And If Bertillon can find such power in

not only the physical characteristics of
the man but the working of his very soul.
I saw a prominent actor play in three
cveeks in New York a jockey, a poet and
Romeo!
They were all "leading" partsâ straight
parts, in the language of the theater â and
he played them all alike.
He entertained hl3 audience, too; but he

Outside there was a great exodus ' of
girls. They had come from all over the
building in " the different departments.
There were hundreds of them,: making
noise enough for so many magpies. .:
"HI there, Jennie," called one- girl,

"Goodness gracious!" remarked another,
"how my wrists ache! But I made $1 65

Crackey. but my wrists do ache!" and she
disappeared Into the crowd, flipping her
hands In the air. '
"Going to. work, to-morrow?" asked a
quiet little creature beside me. "Come and

for me and I went on. At half-past 5 the
whistle blew. It was time to go home. I

"Well," said I to myse!f. "the difference
is on the right side anyway," and I sijrhed.
There was a big laugh behind me. "Mak
ing lots of money?" inquired Mr. Martin.
"Well, sister, you mustn't get discour
aged. You do quite well." You'll bo bank
rupting the company some day. Come
back to-morrow and stay with it. You're
all right."
I went with the rest to gret paid, and
when it came my turn I presented my
modest little bunch of tags, representing
the sum of forty-one cents, and spoke of
the damages due the company. '"Yes, here
you are," said the cashier, tossing out a
nickel and a penny, Â¦ "that's right. Too
needles and one over, and had yet made
but nine pockets and a half at the rate
of 4 cents a dozen. However, there
seemed to fee no time to brood over one's
troubles. The other girl was already
whirring away and had an appallingly
long Ftrin?r of pockets at the back oZ her
machine. I went to work again and
got on very well. All around me the gir!s
were working and chatting. It seemed
no work at all for them. Xow and then
I caught a prlanee of amusement. But
they were kind and did not laugh when
I was looking. At noontime I h?.d broken
another needle and finished forty-nine
pockets â 36 cents and a pocket to Kpare.
Most of the Klrls had brought lunclieon
In 'baskets and ate at the factory. The
noon hour was quite a Jolly one. The
chatter v.-as 5uch chatter as all girls chat
* ter. It was surprising'. I had heard of
) factory p'rls and had had my own ideas
c about how they would chatter. True
enough, there was an occasional Jarring
expression and from a liltle gTOup gath
ered over in a corner there came snatches
of loud laughUT and coarse talk. They
had gathered over there from natural se
lection. The rest were of a different
grade.
"How murh can you make a day?" I
asked of the girl who had untangled my
thread. â¢ ;
"Me?" asked she. "Oh. I make all the
way from a dollar to a dollar and a half.
I can zip It pretty fast."
"Most of us can make a dollar." said
cnother eirl, "it depends on how lazy you
are, and. of course, some girls are natur
ally quicker."
"I don't believe there's to much money
in string work as there is in making the
Â¦whole phcoting match." said a girl with
an immense amount of pink ribbon un
der her ear. fairing a big bite off a
randwlch. "I think I'm jrolrur to quit here
this week and try making the whole

Next morning at 8 I was at the other
factory. There was no trouble getting
work. There Is a big sign cv*r the door
advertislrg for mere Klrls a'nu there Â»r^
some sevrn hundred there already. This
time I was given tin? pieces for an entire
pair of â¢ overalls and set to work. The
machine tn-haved jilcely and I progressed.
The Â¦ .girls were laughing and talking a*
they worked.
"Oh, "Ella." said one. "f Just sot an
answer to that letter I pÂ»K In a pocket
last Christmas. He's a young follow on
n farm away over in Arizona. I think
I'll write." ' f
I did not catch, the reply, but heard
more confldpnces. It , seems there hart
been a great deal of spurt derived from
placing letters in the pockets of the over
allsâcheering missives to the prospective
owners. .' . â¢ Â¦
â¢ "Do you remember the Bis Swede that,
came to see Jos'e?" laughed some oneâ
'and the way he said *Ay ben got a lat
ter in that pockett from tha yung laady.
Ilaak toe see Miss Yosie Yones. I yuat

Â¦ "Yes; and Kittie's cowboy. Kit nearly
fell dead when she saw the guns in his
belt and the bowie-knife. What a neck

/"Celebrating? Well, he was feeling
frlorious. I had to pass him on to the
next street,' and was afraid he'd come
back any minute. I sat at the window
scared to death all afternoon."
But there had been one real romance.
It was a small sister that caused It.
"To the young man that buys the over
alls," she wrote. "Dear si'-: I hope you
are yung and handsura and good, and
will comÂ« and fall in love with my sister;
she is so good and works so hard all day
to make cur bread '& butter.' I am shure
If you knew my sl3ter you would want
to marry her. I will put this In the over
alls pockett that she rrakes when I go to
the factory, and if you ain't a' Swede like
Josle got, come to see Ada and me and
marry her. Then she won't haf to work.
And I can go to scool. Yours truly.'
"ETTIE GANN, 7â Harrison street. S. F."
The young man was hot a Swede, "like
Josie got," but a very nice young fanner
.'uily around thh edges of the pockets,
they seemed positively a thing of beauty.
My elation was such that the girl next to
me had made half another pair before I
realized how much time I had lost In con
templation of my handiwork. At noon I
had nearly finished another pair and had
an appetite that made nee regret the size
of the luncheon J had brought.
"Won't you try some of my jelly?" In
vited the slrl next to me. as we spread *
out our lunches. "Please do â how do you
like the workâ ever tried it before?"
I answered her questions and we chat
ted sociably.
"I tell you. I feel pretty well satisfied."
she confided. "Why. I think the girls who
work in stores arc awfully foolish. They
tire themselves to death for wages that
no one could live on. Most of them
wouldn't hear to this kind of work, but
they don't know how fooli3h they are. It
was a long time before I would do It. I
had r. sort of pride. I used to be a sten
ographer."
"And wliat was the matter with sten
ography? Didn't It pay as well?"
"Well, no; there are only a few posi
tions worth having. There's nothing ia
stenography and typewriting unless you.
are mighty lucky to get a good placeâ and
I'll tell you," she whispered, leaning her
pretty face close to mine, "girls can work
nere without havinc to go to French din
ners* to hold tl'elr Jobs!"
I ate an apple tart.
The afternoon work began and the ma
chines rattled on. Down the long line of
machines big blue overalls were pouring
out from behind and every one working
with a will. I caught, the spirit of tha
thing and sewed madly. Each girl wa*
crowding as many stitches to the minuta
as she possibly could. It was a race with
time for ninety cents to the dozen. At
â¢ ttve minutes to 5 I had completed tha
fifth pair of overalls! It was not worth
while to commence another. I had made
37H cents! There was the item of the
broken band. 20 cents, leaving me a bal
ance of 17Vi cents. Not very much, it is
true I thought, as I presented my tags at
the window, but it is ll^i cents better than
yesterday, and if I kept on. well, there
would be no limit to the money I might
The'experfenced girls were Jingling their
dollars and extra flfty-cent pieces In an
Â» encouraging way, and they all had some
thing kind to say about the speed I would
attain In a day or so. That would have
been very nice Indeed, if I had really been
in search of work. The factory girl Is not
at all the color she is painted. Good luck
be with her, and may the number of over

tive Mattle. "nur we can't make her out.
She won't talk to. nobody. Seems to be
too proud. Guess she thinks she's too
good to make overalls."
"Now, Mat," said a pleasant-faced girl
next to me, "ycu don't know what you're
talkin' about. She may have troubles of
her ovrzu 'Tain't any one's business if
she wants to keep to herself. Maybe she's
blue Rn' had bad luck. I didn't always
work in a factory, either."
In the course of the afternoon I gathered
In a nr.mber of tags. A tag was given
for each dozen pieces. I had finished
another dozen pockets and had started in
on buckle straps for a change. They were
three cents per dozen and I could .turn
them out pretty fast. I was turning them
out particularly fast about 3 o'clock when
something dreadful happened. There was
a bang, a whir-r-rr-r and a spinning
sound. Somethins seemed to have gone
wrong with the machine. I had broken
the big wheel band and another needle.
That wf.s twenty-flve cents more to the
debit side of my account and the needla
fortune. Presently the machines began to
hum again. The ambitious girls were go
ing to work. Among them was a pale,
tall girl that had nothing to say and didn't
work very fast. She, too, had difficulty
with her pockets.
"We dunno who she Is." said the talka-

The next morning- at a quarter to S
I was there. I had my apron and scis

The girls were pouring in and getting set
tled at their machines.
The man in charge led me to a vacant
place in the pocket and strap department
and put me to work. I was one of a long
row of girls, the rest all working away,
the machines humming and string? of
completed pockets running out from be
hind the needles, But I was a beginner,
and had to learn how to put on the power
and take it off properly, with a pressure
of the foot, and my pocket.* did not come
out very fast. My w<>rk was heaped up
In a stack beside me and everything

behind in quite a respectable string, and
I was beginning to feel as If I was mak-j

dozen.
Presently my thread got tangled up ar.il

to me kindly Btopped work and cave me

said she, "needles count up. and you know
we have to buy them, three for a nickel.
Just so slow and you're all right. Look
out how you turn on the power,. If you
break that big wheel band it's two bits.
The little one is 20 cents."
That was cheerful. For all I could see
my liabilities threatened to exceed my
eewis. I had broken 5 cents' worth of

It was a very pretty little story, but lis

not controlled the power right and had
broken the little wheel band. How very
large a pair of overalls are any way! I
sewed away Industriously and slowly the
garment began to evolve Itself. At last
they were doneâ to the last stitch. I held
them up and surveyed them triumphantly.
Behold. I had made a pair of overalls.

"I'm her," said the neat little girl who
opened the door. "Who're you?"
"I have come about the letter," he
answered, handing the scrawl to her. "X

"Oh," paid Ettle, Jumping up and down

she invited him into the tidy little

When Martinez recovered from his grief
his business head got into motion again.-'
He buried Anita and then set up the table ;
as a monument.to thfe falthfult animal's
memory-; It '.was, not long before a shanty"
was run up over tho table arid . it re
quired, only a- few;, days Â¦ more ," to' get
enough whisky to dignify the shanty, with
the name of saloon! Far and wide.Alar
tlnez spread the news -that there was, to
be an opening on Saturday" night in honor
of the only billiard table in Southern Ore-
And what an opening was there! There
were music 'and danciny.' and: singing and
drinking,: and, a~."punching\of the ivor-.
ies.'' The other saloons in the neighbor
hood had to close down for.' the "> night. |
The table became; the "proper.- thing"
in the diggings, .and there 'was a line Â¦of
players' every night i waiting for* a'chance
to get a cue. At. length a'saloonman took
the table and;shanty off "Martinez'^ hands
and gave lessons In billiards. _ His ',. most
apt pupil was a lad to whom he had given
employment. He -learned /like; sixty. i
man who had employed him. He. demand
ed recompense for Anita. The man de
manded his, table.. There, were not strong
men enough In the country to carry the
table over to Althouse, and nobody want
ed to buy It. ' ,
?hey let it drop It fell not on "Anita's
back". The wise old mule had sidestepped.
Try as they might, they could not get It
on that way, but no mule ever, fooled
wise old Martinez Ions. He rigged up a
'block and tackle and with. the aid of a
stout limb hauled the table Into the air.
Then Anita was backed under the table
and the rest was easy.
l-*or three days the pack worked .to a
charm. At night the table was removed
and In the morning reloaded. On the
third evening the train stopped at Rattle
sn.ike Bend, about a mile from WaldoJ
The pack stampededâ all except Anita.
Martinez knew that Anita would keep
right on to Waldo and he left her, to her
own resources while he Joined 'his' men
In the roundup of the runaways.
Anita was not to be found when two
hours later the train arrived at Waldo.
A search of -two hours failed to find her.
"All right," said the philosophical Mar
tinez, "she can sleep with her load," and
he. rolled over in'hls blankets.
Martinez's anguish knew no bounds. He
cursed himself; he cursed the mule, then
apologized 'â¢ to the memory of Anita and
went over to Althouse Creek 1 to curse the
They found her next morning eight miles
away from Waldo. She had slept with her
load; she was still 'sleeping. For, a matter
of fact, she had carried "her last burden;
she was 'quite dead.
He loaded up a miscellaneous lot of
etuff on hJs mules and then It came Ani
ta's turn. Now the gentle Anita had never
f.cen a billiard table, but was wise enough
to know that It was going to be no snap
â¢ to' lug that thing- across the mountains;
Elcht men elevated the table, but when
The sijrht of the queer looking package
staggered the packer, but he reflected
that it would not stagger Anita, and If not
all would be well. So he ripped out a
c tr5r.fr of Spanish oaths to help the thing
along, then he got his men and 6ixty odd
mulcsin line, for he was tljfe director of
a erreat pack train. Â¦%
So paid Martinez and he readily made
a contract to fetch the table over the
divide as far as Sailors Diggings at Wal
do Well.
At length one enterprising fellow con
ceived the scheme of Importing a billiard
table from Can Francisco. It was an easy
matter, he nrgued. to get the table to
Crescent City by water, but how to get
the machine owr the divide! He sought
eld Martinez, the best packer in South

the pride of his life. Anything'that Anita

was afraid of no man. But they, said'that.

,Then Â¦ there was ::Â¦ a cheer, and while

to' Andrews .'and '.. said simply:
. ; "Thank. you, Jim."
Jim Andrews had one of the best Claims ;
in the diggings.-' He liked Ao " see every- -

'â¢was': never known gamble. Some ?

with a ravishing smile that set; the. hearts';
of the miners beating the devil's tattoo
and : put their . heads in a whirl. . Dollie
Deane was her name, and it leaked out
that she wa^a correspondent for an East
ern magazine.
..Very .circumspect was Dollle, and while
all gentleness itself, one or. two of the
rough' characters found that familiarity
bred contempt on her part and great re- :
spectfor her on theirs. Dollle seemed
to take a fancy to Billy from the start,
but everybody looked upon Billy as a sort
of a guidepost. He might have been 20:
he might have been some years older; but
he was only a boy.
Jim -Andrews; of the men. apparently

mention that, but the camp knows it, and
ware all friends In this little commu
nity. Let us gamble for the first right
to address the-lady and may the best man
win."
There were murmurs of satisfaction
from the crowd.
"All life's a gamble," Dollle had said.
"I never gamble," said Jim, stiffly, a
flush on his face. .
TIkj other was equal to the occasion.
"Name a friend," said he; "I bar no
body and no game."
"Name me," whispered a voice at Jim's
elbow. ."Make the game billiards."
It was Billy.
Andrews was sadly at fault His friend3
were u raring him to take up the challenge.
A feeling of shame came over him. Then
the thought of what Dollle had said
struck home once more.
"By : I'll do It!" he fairly hissed.
"And I'll name Billy, this boy here."
"And the game?" queried the gambler,
with a mocking smile.
"Billiards." said Jim,. now calm.
No wonder his rival smiled again. He
had amused himself with the bumpkin
several times. Once or twice he had al
lowed him to beat him. He grew quite
jubilant and treated the house.
He won the first shot. Before he shot
he laid $300 on the cloth.
"Anybody like to bet on thl3 gamer' he
said blandly. "No? Five hundred to
$400-going, goingâ $300. Well, will, must
think I'm a winner. Make It $200."
"I'll take that myself!" .
. It . was Billy : who spoke, and asv his
money was laid on the table there was
tremendous -cheering.
"Want any more?" asked the good na
tured gambler. .
: "Go on,* and' play," said Billy, his face
The other loeftefl at him with a steel*
glitter in his eye, while tho crowd yelled
Its delight.
"I'll bet you JSCO even." he said.
"Gees," said the boy, and $1000 "flra^
placed in the stakeholder'9 hands.
"Five hundred dollars to you. Billy. liS
you beat him," cried Jim Andrews.
Not a word was said during the rest
of the game. The jramb'.er made a run
of 3. then. Billy ran 7. The other gritted,
-his teeth and hi* brow was covered with)
perspiration. He tried to cushion tho
balls, but they ran away from him. Ha
prided himself on his Knglish. but the
draw fell short. He was hardly safe on
a carrom, and somehow or other Billy
was eterÂ»*Â»!ly leaving the balls in tha
same corner. He had scored 22 points,
when Billy finished the game.
Jim Andrews grasped Billy by the hand,
paid him his $000 and ordered tha drlnka
for the house.
Then the gambler awakened.
â¢'Hold on." he said, rather unsteadily.
"The drinks. arc mine. I lost." And tho
crowd applauded his sameness, and Jaclc
Arnold paid over to Billy V&O.
The gambler's eyes sought those of JI^Â»
Andrews and found them. A
"Well, you've won." he Bneered* **buÂ£.~
you weren't game enough to make you*
-own fight."
"I told you I never gambled." -was tho
quiet answer.
"No, but you stood In to rob me."
"You lie!" reared Jim Andrews, making
toward him.
A pistol barrel flashed In the air, but
almost asÂ»qulekly was the muzzle of a
â¢â¢gun" pressed against the gambler's tem
ple.
"Drop H!" cried tha voice of Jack Ar
nold, who was behind the gun. "Now gl
at him. Jim, and scrap."
For full twenty minutes the men fought
and clinched. The gambler used his flsta
well, but Jim was just a little better and
a little stronger. Both men were bacfi/
beaten up, but the gambler was under
the table.
About 5 o'clock the next evening Jlw.

tions have been going on looking to an arrangement whereby a strong, escort of co-operating . troops shall go to Pe

to believe that some of the most influential men in China favor this means of getting the Ministers away from Peking under

WASHINGTON. Aug. 11.â It Is
stated officially to-night that
this Government will pay no at
tention whatever to the latest
appeal from China, transmitted
In the form of a memorial from the south
ern Viceroys tagging the United States to
use Its influence against the landing of
British troops in the Yangtse Valley.
This jxemorial was transmitted to the
State Dwanmcnt this morning by the
Chinese Minister, Mr. Wu. It urged on
'this Government the serious consequences
that would follow the landing of a British
force at Shanghai and represented that
the preparations already made had in
duced a panic among the resident Chinese
and would paralyze commercial activity
in that part of the empire almost as much
as a formal declaration of war by Great
Britain.
This Government deetfled, however, that
not only wo-uld it be entirely out of Its
province to interfere with the British pro
gramma In Southern China which was be
ing: carried forward by Admiral Seymour
on the ground with the full knowledge
of local conditions, but in view of China's
present recalcitrant attitude and the lack
lip W date of even an acknowledgment
of our latest demand concerning the
enfety of our Ministers, the United States
Â¦was not inclined to shoulder any of
China's troubles with Great Britain, nor
any other of the powers.
Appeal to Be Ignored.
Consequently the appeal of the Viceroys
Â¦will be Ignored. It Is possible that the
commxislcation from Minister Wu may be
turned over to the British Government
for its information on the ground of the
frienfily principle that has been adopted
â¢ by the powers of keeping each other in
formed on the various developments In
the situation. Even this Btep, however,
has not been decided upon yet, and will
tÂ»e left to the Judgment of the President.
In connection with the proposed land
â¢tag of Admiral Seymour's force it may
Â¦be said that the report of Japan's opposi
tion to this move is without any official
conSnaailon here. The Japanese Minis
ter In general conversation, when the sub
ject was first broached, caid that he had
210 Information of any protest having beea'
entered by Japan. What developments
eubsequent events might bring it was im
possible for him to say. It may be said,
however, aside from the Japanese Minis

A special dispatch from St. Petersburg
attributes to Russia the intention to nil
Manchuria with troops and not to let go
that territory when the present ebullition
is over. The Russian War Office expects
to have 142,000 men and 242 guns in Siberia

Sir Chih Talks Freely.
The Chinese Minister. Sir Chlh Chen Lo

isters of the powers In declining to leave
Peking had underestimated the situation.
adding 1 that if the allies pushed on to the
.capital it might have the effect of In
volving the southern provinces In great
trouble. Only to-day, the Minister con
tinued, he had received the Information
that the proposed landing of Indian troops
at Shanghai had already caused grave ap
prehension, and there would be an exodus
of Chinese merchants. If these troops
were landed, he pointed out. others, of
course, would follow and great conflicts
would result.
The Minister said If the powers bad
adopted his suggestions and opened nego
tiations with LI Hung Chang matters
might have been arranged. The march of
the allies on Peking, the Chinese diplo
mat further remarked, would probably
endanger the foreigners' lives, adding
that telegrams had already been received
showing that trouble has arisen in this
connection.
Surprise in Washington.
WASHINGTON. Aug. 1Lâ The. action ef
the Russian Government In authorizing
M. de Giers to start from Peking to Tien

concern and surprise In official circles
here, as It is diametrically opposed to tha
course of the other Governments, al
though there is no disposition to question
the good faith which has Inspired it. ThÂ«
officials say that Its only effect Is to
leave M. de Giers acting Independently,
and upon his own discretion. If he deter
mines to leave Peking with a Chiness
guard and succeeds in getting through to
Tientsin it at least wlU have demonstrat

'WASHINGTON,' Aug. 11â The following

"REMEY."
The cablegram of Admiral Remey
transmitting the report of General ChaJV
fee as to the battle of Yangtsun, togetheT
with the report of General Gaselee, the
English commander at the front, contains
few details not already known. General
Gaselee's statement shows that the Chi
nese occupied trenches and that the for
eign forces were compelled to assault
them. Finally after forming: their line,
the allies were obliged to charge over a
stretch of. territory three miles In extent,
directly Into the teeth of the Chinese rifla
and shell fire.
It is presumed that having carried out
successfully the plan of the movement as
far as Yangtsun the commanders of the
allies will have to go into consultation
again to decide upon the further course
of the advance from that point to Peking.
This 13 considered unfortunate owing to
the possibility that dissensions and Jeal
ousies may arise which will delay further
advance.

of date, throws little fresh light on the situation in Peking. The United States Minister says:
"Whatever the outcome we will hold out indefinitely."
Some disquiet has been caused by the Russian Government apparently separating itself
from the other powers by authorizing its Minister to leave Peking under Chinese escort. The
difference of policy is, perhaps, more apparent than real, the final decision being left with M. de
Giers, who will undoubtedly not leave the capital without an adequate guarantee of safety.
Negotiations, it is stated, are in progress looking to the removal of all foreigners in
Peking under sufficient escort of the allied troops, the idea being to obviate the necessity of
a forced march to Peking in the face of strong opposition with an inadequate force and under
considerable climatic disadvantages. So far as is known the relieving force has. not advanced
beyond Yangtsun, and a section of it has returned to Tientsin, possibly to strengthen the
garrison there on account of the threatened gathering of Chinese forces around the allied base,
reported in a special dispatch to The Call from Chefu.

Still the reported intention of Admiral Seymour to land British troops at Shanghai
causes forebodings. The United States has refused to take action on an appeal from the
southern Viceroys, through Minister Wu, to use its influence to prevent the landing of troops
in Yangtse Valley. If a dispatch from Berlin is to be relied upon, however, both Germany
and France will interpose to preclude a realization of such schemes as Great Britain is cred

BERLIN, Aug. 11.â The belief still pre
vails here that the allied forces have not
undertaken the Peking advance and that '
the recent action at Ptitsang and Yang- P
tsun were solely meant to secure the
strategic tenure of Tientsin against the (
Chinese troops sent from Peking or from
the south, as Yangstsun dominates both
railroad and river communication. The
military authorities here also maintain
that an advance upon Peking with the
present forces and lacking an officer In
chief command would be equivalent to
failure .and . enormous losses. The For
eign Office wholly distrusts the reliability |
of the news that Li Hung Chang has
been empowered to negotiate for peace
and the German press coincides in that
view.
The news received here that the United
States is satisfied with the appointment
of Field Marshal Count von "Waldersee to
the chief command of the allied forces
has created great satisfaction, as for. a
time it was feared that the United States
might, with Great Britain, .object, thus
frustrating military harmony.
The news cabled here that the United
States is now desirous of bringing about
a clear diplomatic understanding regard- i
ing the intended extent of the expedition
is received by the Foreign Office favor
ably, since the aims of the United States,
viz.: The re-establishment of order, the
awarding of damages to Americans for
injury and guarantees against the recur
rence of similar events, tally precisely,
so the Foreign Offlca declares, with the
German programme. It is here surmised,
however, that such diplomatic negotia
tions will not meet The approbation . of
Great Britain and Russia, whose enor
mous sacrifices" in men and money owing
to the Chinese trouble, seem, indeed,
worth some equivalents. Regarding Great
Britain's apparent designs upon the
Yangtse Valley, particularly Shanghai,
Germany will not allow their realizations,
and in this France supports Germany,
and it is hoped here the United Statas
will also do - so, since such - action con
travenes the open-door policy. Germany,
before long, will have a good-sized force
in, Shanghai to checkmate single-handed
the -British â¢ schemes there. The corre
spondent of the Associated Press hears
that a brigade of 5000 men Is now forming
and will proceed to Shanghai for that
purpose and to protect German commer
cial interests in the valley, notably at
Shanghai and Hanjoi.
German Press Comments.
The German press comments on the
present situation are very varied. The Lo
cal Anzelger, deems it probable that Field
klarshal von AValdersee will not be bedded
In roses in China, owing to lack of har
mony among the powers, Â¦ even at this
early stage, and it believes that before
long quarrels will arise between Russia
and Japan, France and Great Britain
and the United btates and Germany. It
points out that the main trouble among
the powers, is not of a military but of a
commercial character.
The Vorwaerts says "Â£he irresponsioie
China policy," meaning the Emperor's,
has thus far "carried rioting before it,"
and that the "responsible party of the
Cabinet has long been annulled by the
press."
. Several papers, ar-ong them being the
Hamburg Correspondenz, counsels the
Immediate seizure of the right Yangtse
shore by. Germany in order to neutralize
Great Britain's attempts there.
The Germanla and Cologne Volks Zei
tung. the two leading Centrist organs,
insist" that the Reichstag decide on the
present and future China policy to be
followed by Germany. '
The Prince" Regent of Bavaria, Luitpold,
has summoned his Berlin delegate to the
Bundesrath. Count von Lerchenfeld, to
take counsel with him. regarding artlclfc
64 of the imperial constitution as to
whether it is admissible that besides vol
unteers, regulars may. also be sent to
China. This, with a number of other
signs, shows that, the Emperor William's
vigorous policy toward China is by no
means approved all around.
* Doubt Pretoria Conspiracy.
The British news about the Pretoria
conspiracy to seize the person of Lord
Roberts and shoot all the British offi
cers possible is discredited here. The Vos-
Bische Zeitung ridicules the alleged fact
that foreign conspirators snould plan suc.i
an elaborate scheme requiring this, and
the Deutsche. Tages Zeitung recalls th*
previous Johannesburg conspiracy, whose
purpose.lt adds, like the present "plot,"
was merely a British desire to expel all
foreigners and others considered obnox
ious. - . - ..,. , â¢
' Â¦". The Vosslsche Zeitung prints a private
letter from.' Pretoria,, dated July 10, in
which it is related how the British Is
sued ' orders expelling forthwith a num
ber of peaceable German residents of Pre
toria and -elsewhere, giving them Â¦ but" a
few. hours in which to regulate their pri

ROME, Aug. 11.â King Victor Emaauel
III took the formal constitutional oath
to-day before Parliament. The Senate
chamber was draped with mourning, the
benches and tribunes being covered with
black furnishings, bordered with silver.
The chamber was ailed with Senators
and Deputies, royal missions, high of
ficials of state and the diplomatic corps.
The booming of cannon announced the
departure of the royal party from the
Qulrlnal.
All along the route large crowds were
assembled and gave the new King an
ovation. He was received on the steps of
the Senate by the committee of . the
Chamber of Deputle3 and Senate In a
pavilion specially erected and handsomely
decorated.
When the cortege entered the Senate
chamber, the King, being accompanied
by the Duke of Aosta, the Count of
Turin and the Duke of Genoa, the Depu
ties and Senators arose and then began a
long and exciting scene of enthusiasm.
His Majesty later took the oath and de
livered an addres9. The weather was
beautiful. The full text of the address is
as follows:
My first thought Is for my peopleâ a thought
of love and gratitude. The people who wept
by the casket of the King whom they loved are
brought in close touch with me and they have
demonstrated the racial foundation ' which a
liberal monarchy has In the country. From
these manifestations of sorrow, I draw the
most . favorable auguries for my reign. The
noble and pious sentiment, which sprang spon
taneously from the soul of the nation at the
news of the tragic event, tells me that in the
hearts of Italians there still vibrates the voice
of patriotism, which inspired at all times
worthy miracles. I am proud of the power I
am assuming. It Is with a high head and seek
ing a nobler idea that I consecrate myself to
my country, with . all the ardor and strength
of which I feel myself "capable; with all the
strength the examples and traditions of my
house give me.' The word of the magnanimous
Charles Albert, who granted liberty, is sacred,
just as are those of my grandfather, who
achieved the union of Italy, and of my august
father, who, by all the acts of his life, showed
We was a worthy heir of the virtues of the
father of his country. In his work my father
has had the assistance of my august and vener
ated mother. It Is she who engraved on my
heart and spirit the sentiment of my duty as
a Prince and an Italian. So in my work. I
shall be aided by my wife, who. born of a
strong race, will consecrate herself entirely to
the country of her choice.
Of the friendship of all the powers we have
had eloquent proof in the participation in our
mourning and I wish to express my profound
gratitude to all.
Italy has always been an efficient Instrument
in concord and will be eo during my reign in
the common aim of preserving peace. But ex
ternal peace is not alone sufficient. We must
have internal peace and accord and the good
will of all men to develop every Intellectual
force and economic feature. It Is necessary to
raise the young generations in the love of
country and of honesty and labor. It is this
sentiment which . inspires our armies on land
and sea, who come from the pecple and who
are a pledge of the fraternity which binds the
whole Italian family.' in' unity and love of
country. It Is necessary to concentrate our
selves and to defend ourselves by. the wisdom
of our laws and their strict application. The
monarchy and Parliament should proceed united
in this beneficial task. Â¦
I mount the throne without fear and quietly
with knowledge .of my rights and duty as
King. Oh, that : Italy had the confidence In
me that I have In the destiny of the country.
Xo human force Is capable of destroying what
my father ha* shaped with so much abnega
tion. We must awake and Â¦- apply all our
strength: to preserve .intact the great victories
of unity and liberty. I shall, never be lacking
In confidence in our liberal institutions and will
never default in Initiative Â¦ energy -when action
should b*- taken. to defend vigorously the ftlori
ous institutions of our country and the precious
heritagen of- our ancestors.
Reared in love qf religion and "of country. I
take God as witness of myu promts* that from
to-day I :, will- worJc.alwaya with all my heart
for the greatness and prosperity of my coun
try. . '
: The , King Tspoke In a strong . voice [ a nd
his words greatly, touched every one pres
ent, many persons being In tears. When
the sovereigns re-entered the Qulrlnal the
Delivers a Stirring Address Calling
for the Full Support of His Sub
jects and Speaks of His
Love for Them.

No confirmation of the rumor can be had

BOSTON, Aug. 11. â The American Bap

A. F. Groesbeck. in charge of the Baptist
Mission at Ur.g Kung, about seventy miles
north of Swatow, announcing that his
mission has been destroyed- by the Chi

This is the first intimation received of
actual violence in that section of China-
Rev. J. H. Foster of Swatow and Rev.
Jacob Speecher of Katyang had sent their

WASHINGTON. Aug. 11.â There is much
uncertainty here as to just what the Rus
sians are doing at Nluchwang. The Nash

LONDON. Aug. 11.â This can hardly bÂ«
Raid to have been a lively -week In Eng
land, for obituaries and funerals have
taken the largest space in the news
papers. Particular groups had plenty to
think about. Nevertheless, financiers
have been busy with the "American
loan"; politicians with the dying Parlia
ment and the general election prospects
and society with country amusements.
The way the South African war drags
cut wears ur>on Englishmen and no news
Â¦would be eo welcome as that some well-
â¢wisher of the Transvaal had convinced
President Krugcr that nothing in Europe
or China will make Great Britain relax
her ever-tifthterJng grip on South Africa.
Everybody in the criny and who has any
thing to do with it in South Africa wants
to come home and is heartily sick of the
whole thlnp. Hut, knowing that it must
go on to a finish, the dregrs of war are
having pome bitterness. The plot to kill
British officers at Pretoria Is taken in
Englar.d as .showing the savage temper
of the Boers, while the Uritishers are re
ported to be doing some things which are
provoking adverse comment in Great
Britain. Thus the Standard prints a Pre
toria diFpatch. <Ja.te<l 'August 9, saying: :
"The Boers sniped a train at Bronk
hurst yesterday, on the line between Pre
toria and Middle-burg. Two of its occu
pants were wounded. In accordance with
Lord Roberts" warning, all the farms
were fired within a radius of ten miles."
Even the Eng'ij=h papers say there must
be a mistake somewhere. A couple of
Boers fired at a military train, perfectly
within their rights as warriors, and every
farmhouse within ten miles in every di
rection is committed to the flames.

power of projecting himself Into the as

how a change in their designs would be

Russia Is disposed to act to a certain extent Independently of-the other powers and to pursue a separate : policy. A mem- .Â¦>
bcr of the Cabinet said to-day that the Russian Government undoubtedly had a rlghtto take such a course if It .wished to '.'Â¦

Libre Parole says:
"We will be considered a nation of the
second part â in fact, a part of the Ger
man confederation," while -the Echo de
Paris .speaks of the humiliation of the
French soldiery and the sacrifice therein
imposed. What makes the dose more nau
seating Is the fact that General Negrier
on July 24 pleaded to be Bent to China,
but his offer to go was not accepted. He
outranks Count von Waldersee, and thus
it would have been permitted to France
to hold the leading ortlce. The announce
ment in Berlin that France acquiesced in
the selection of the commander in chief
Is at least premature. No such acknowl
edgment has been admitted, so the For
eign Office informed a representative of
the Associated Press, but there is no dis
position to stand out against the other
powers in consenting when Count von
Waldersee shall have reached China.
France Will Do Its Duty.
"ThS3 hubbub." said a member of
France's ofllcial family, "is purely politi
cal and is not disconcerting. We have a
present duty to perform, which is the im
mediate relief of the Christians In Pe
king. Surely none expects, in the face of

counsels inactivity for that time? The

the advisability of -quick action, for It is
evident that the dynasty is painfully anx
ious to rid Itself, of the foreign Ministers
in order to arrest the march of the allies
on Peking. It is equally certain that It
means almost sure death to all foreigners

The recent announcement of decorations
conferred gave the reactionary press an
opportunity to recall the proceedings of

all those who were prominently connected

of the High Court in the proceedings
against Dr. de Vllllers, charged with in

passed upon Derouiede. Dr. Pozzi was a
member of the court. The men met at a
club and De Vllliers said: "I am sorry to

result was a duel. In which Dr. Pozzl was
wounded. Although a reconciliation was

Next Saturday the official announcement
cf the awards of the Exposition juries will
be made. The occasion will be very Im
posing. The ceremonies will take place In
the Salle des Fetes, and the President ot
the republic, his Cabinet and other func
tionaries will be present. The general
commission of each country Is expected
to inarch to the place assigned, preceded
by Its national flag, guards, staff, etc. A
magnificent musical programme has been
arranged. At the same time decorations
will be bestowed upon some members of
the foreign commission. So great pres
sure has been brought to bear by those
holding costly concessions that the au
thorities have finally agreed to-a 'scaling
of the prices originally fixed. A commit
tee also has been appointed, consisting of
M. Plquart, the Commissioner General of
the Exposition; his directors, the manag
ers of four of the leading papers and the
managers of the Opera Comique, the Come-,
die Francalse and the Theatre rlu Chate
let, for the purpose of arranging a series
of fetes. The first of these occurred. on
Friday night last, taking the form or a
Venetian fete. The Seine was alive with
brightly illuminated boats, carrying bands
of music, living tableaux and fireworks.
One hundred and fifty craft participated..
The affair was very successful.
On Sunday a new set of American

Special Dispatch to The Call.
More than two months ago mynelf and hus
band took dinner with the Schefers and she
nermed in fairly good health then. We had
soup fish and meat, my husband bringing the
flfh from downtown. I used to go over quite
often and help Mrs. Schefer with her sewing
She told me about her husband's fears anrl
paid that she often denied herself of things
JuÂ«t to humcr him. He liked to be boss and
she always let him have his own way. For
fear that the enemy would put poison In the
house he etuffed the cracks under the win
dows and doors with paper and cloth. Often
times it was bo close In the house Mrs. Schefer
could hardly breathe. She was troubled with
asthma a rood deal.
Schefer's Queer Ideas.
She told me ehe used to weigh 170 pounds
but a week before her death I don't believe
she welched much over 100. Schefer had news
paper clippings about deaths and accidents
caused by poisoning pasted al! over the hnuse
and he also had a book, a chemical work by*
a German scientist, from which he read every
day. He had a lot of coal oil cans stored In
thf kitchen. They were empty and at night
they would vibrate, causing a noise, which he
mistook for the firing of the poison and fever
balls by the enemy. I believe that toward the
ord he convinced his wife that the noise really
was shooting. /
The stories that he abused his wife are false!
He thought the world of her. and honestly be
licvlnu that some one . was trying . to poison
them he kept food from her to Insure her
safety. It has also been reported that Schefer
compelled his . wife to ' draw a plow while he
eteered the machine. He owned no plow the
only thing of the kind on the farm being a
small cultivator. He might have had her draw
this along, as many wives would be glad to do
lor their husbands. â¢
There were Â¦ thirteen sacks of â¢ flour in the
house besides a lot of dried food, .but he for

On the advice of Dr. Hatch of the State

Before leaving he begged to Judge Man
non to save him from what he declared a
conspiracy to get rid of him. He admit
ted to the Judge that he had written over
300 pages of letters to Governor Gage and
his predecessor, begging them to protect
him from his enemies.
At the examination he was confronted
with the letter and was asked to produce
the shells. He returned to the house In
company with an officer and brought back
several mud cells about the size of a bean
Dr. Wyckoff handed one to Judge Mannon,
who proceeded to open it cautiously. The

Produces the Poison Balls.
It had been intended to remove the
woman to the hospital the first of the
week, but Bhe sank rapidly and the end
came about 5 o'clock Monday afternoon.
Schefer was "given a hearing before
Judge Mannon on Monday morning. The
letter which he had written to Governor
Gage was first introduced as evidence. In
this letter he described his wife's illness
as very critical and attributed it to the
poison, which was being scientifically ad
ministered to her by their enemies. The
poison, he WTOte, was inside small balls
or capsules, which were fired Into his
house at night. These balls; he said, were
in three sizes â large, medium and small.
He wrote that he had picked up several
of the balls that had failed to explode
and he was ready to submit them as evi
dence. The cat had swallowed one, he
said, and had refused to eat anything for
throe days thereafter.
He was asked if a doctor had attended
on his wife, and he replied in the negative.
The constables then Informed him tnat he
was under arrest and that he must come
with them to the Courthouse. He went
along rather reluctantly. Drs. Wyckoff
and Stout were sumomned to attend Mrs.
Schefer. They found the woman suffer
ing from lack of nourishment, and sho
was also troubled with eczema on her
right arm and other parts of the body.
She was very weak and could speak
barely above a whisper. On the stove the
doctors found a pot partially filled with
cold mush. This, with the exception'of a
few pieces of stale bread, was all there
was to eat in the house.
"My wife is very sick and I wish you
wouid not disturb her," Schefer said
calmly.
Judge Mannon issued a warrant for
Schefer's arrest Saturday morning and
Constables Briggs and Lynch went to the
house about noon. Everything appeared
to be closed up, but the back door was
found unlocked and the constables entered
without the formality of knocking. The
air was fetid and hot. The men proceeded
to the front end of the house, where they
found Schefer lying at the foot of a bed,
which was occupied by his wife.
An Awful Sight
Their mode of operation, ho claimed,
was to feed the cattle and poultry with
food that contained poison. This poison,
he maintained, was compounded with a
chemical mixture which caused the deadly
ingredients to affect the milk and eggs.
The Grand Jury, after hearing his testi
mony, referred the matter to Judge Kob
ert McGarvey, who ordered that Schefer
be committed to the Mendocino asylum.
Schefer seemed entirely sane upon all
other matters and talked intelligently to
the physicians and attendants at the in
stitution. He was, after a short period
of detention, paroled and discharged. He
returned to Uklah and again settled down
on his farm and nothing more was heard
from him until a week ago last Friday,
when Othman Stevens, secretary of the
State Lunacy Commission, acting under
orders from Governor Gage, wrote to
Judge Mannon, advising- the examination
of Schefer. ;

The front entrance of the house is

of limited dimensions and two or three
small outhouses complete what up to one
week ago to-day served as the home of
John Henry Schefer and his wife, Anna
Klizabeth Schefer.
To-day, when a Call representative vis
ited the farm, there was a weird stillness
about the place. The barn was empty of
its cattle and poultry, the curtains of the
house were drawn and the screech of a
belated night owl alone disturbed the
quietude of the scene. .It was the peace
that follows upon, a tragedy.
One week ago next Tuesday afternoon
the final chapter was enacted In a pitiful
dread drama that is without parallel in
this county. If Indeed it has its equal in
the entire State â a tragedy the awful
realization of which will probably never
come to the clouded mind of the living
principal.
When the' Schefers Came to Ukiah.
The story leading up to last week's
tragedy begins back in 18S4. The Schefers
had then lived in the town about twelve
years. They came here from Switzerland,
and soon after their- arrival Schefer
bought the little farm. There are about
two acres of land, and on this he raised
some vegetables, but made a specialty of
stocking honey. He was a third degree

to appear before that body for the pur

of poisoning. The persons against, whom

Nothing: more was heard from
Schefer until a week ago last Fri
day, when Judge Mannon received
a letter from Othman Stevens, sec
retary of the State Lunacy Com
mission, who. acting- upon the ad
vice of Governor Gage, who had
received a number of communica
tions from Schefer. requested an
examination into the man's sanity.
A warrant for his arrest was Is
sued by Judge Mannon Saturday
morning. Constables R. W. Briggs
and Thomas Lynch went to the
house and placed Schefer under ar
rest. They found Schefer sitting
at the foot of the bed talking to
his wife, who was In bed and ap
parently suffering intense pain.
The room was hot and stuffy.
Every crack and crevice waa

woman, who it was learned had
long been a sufferer from asthma,

elapsed since Sheriff Taylor and posse
took the trail leading from here into the
Anthony Peak region, hot on the track of
both Murderer King and his pilot, the
half-breed Indian. Three members of the
posse returning Thursday and Friday
brought exciting accounts of Taylor's

COAST NEWS IN BRIEF.
lation took place between himself and
Mrs. Himes. but from the time the boy
was old enough to talk he expressed
hatred for his father. Even now he shows
no remorse for the awful deed and when
his father's name Is mentioned he as
sumes a defiant air. The slightest refer
enco to his mother, howerer. causes him
to weep.
It Is almost certain that a part of the
youthful murderer's defense will be the
testimony of experts on pre-natal Influ
ence. The chief argument made by those
engaged in the prosecution of the boy is
that he should be prevented from repeat
ing the poisoning experiment on some one
else for whom he should conceive a dis
like.

Mr. and Mrs. Martin, parents of Elmer
Martin, followed their child to the Jail
door, crying bitterly. They begged Tucker
to let the lad go, but he said the law
would not permit him to grant the re
quest. â¢ â¢
At 2 o'clock M. K. Harris, attorney for
the boys, went before Superior Judge
Webb and asked that Frankie Hlmea and
Elmer Martin be admitted to ball. Dep
uty District Attorney Church said he had
no fear that either of the boys would run
away and at the suggestion of Judge Har
ris the court fixed their bail in the sum
of S500 each. They were released from
custody about an hour later. Fred Himes,
the leader In the plot to murder his
father, will have to remain in prison until
his trial takes place. : Â¦
Nathan Hart Sr., grandfather of Fred
and Frankie Hlme3, tells an interesting
story which throws a new light on the
crime and serves to explain to the satis
faction of many the older boy's rea
son for the killing of his father.. Hart
says Fred's hatred of his father was
hereditary. When Himes married the
boy's mother he was conducting a saloon
business In Santa Cruz. About two months
after the marriage he sold out, collected
all the money he could and deserted his
wife, leaving her penniless. This was
about five months before Fred's birth.
Mrs. Hlmea worried over the sudden dis
appearance of her husband and waited
for his return. When she became satis

Special Dispatch to Ths CalL
VANCOUVER, B. C, Aug. 11.â V?. J.
Lamrlck and Joe Pollard, two well known
citizens who left Vancouver on June 5 for
Knights Inlet on a prospecting tour,
have probably either been murdered by
Indians or killed by cougars. Not a word
has been heard directly from them since
they left. They intended to return here
in three weeks and had provisions only
for that time.
Two Indians, who came from 180 miles
In the Interior, arrived here by the
steamer Queen City last night. They Bay
that two white men came to Knights
Inlet a couple of months ago and came up
to the village of the tribe to which these
men belong. Then they went out and did
not return, and later the Indians say the
bones of two men were found at the foot
of a cliff. Whether they had fallen down
the precipice and were killed, or whether
they were killed by bears or cougars. Is
only a matter of conjecture. At any rate
their bodies and bones had been so
mauled by wild animals and the clothing
was torn away so as to be unrecogniz
able.
. The wives of the men In this city and
their friends Incline to doubt the story of
the Indians, as the details are vapue and
the Indians are not positive. Knlfrht*
Inlet Is only a fp\v miles beyond Butte In
let, which Is 175 miles from Vancouver,
where the Indians have always be^n very
antagonistic, and where in the early days
a party of surveyors were murdered in
cold blood. What happened to these two
venturers or gold seekers Is only a the
ory. Their bleaching bones were found
and around them many tracks of the
cougar. Whether the men were slain by
the aborigines or met their death other
wise may never be known. No party re
turning from prospecting far up the coast
has brought back other news than of the
savagery of the coast tribes and the rug
gedness of the country. The Indians are
.unapproachable, except when they come
to the mouths of the rivers, for the civil
ization of the paleface has had little or no
effect upon these tribes.

As near as can be learned Garner and
his wife had been having trouble and Mrs.
Garner left her husband and returned to
her mother, Mrs. Willingham, who lives
at 134 South Bunker Hill avenue, this city,
arriving Thursday.
Yesterday afternoon the police were no
tified by Sheriff W. B. Thurman of Ma
dera that Garner had left" that place for
Los Angeles and that previous to his de
parture had purchased a- knife â¢Â¦ statin?
that it was for the purpose of cutting
short his wife's earthly career. Mrs. Gar
ner, it is said, also received a similar
warning. Consequently when the train
pulled in this morning there was the big
detective waiting for him. Just what ar
guments were used are not known, but
Garner was persuaded to forego his sau
euinary intentions.

SANTA CRUZ, Aug. 11.â "If your Honor
please," I would -waive the examination,"
were the words of Amos K. Zlegler, the
wife murderer, when he was brought be
fore Justice Craghill this morning for his
preliminary examination.
Zlegler was Informed by District Attor
ney Knight that the law provided for a
preliminary examination and the proceed
ings began. Only an hour was consumed
and Ziegler was held without .bail to an-
Bwer to a charge of murder before the
Superior Court.
The only witnesses examined were Bev
erly Sharp, Ziegler's brother-in-law, and
Dr. Clark. The court reporter read the
testimony of Ziegler as it was given at
the Coroner's inquest. .Ziegler, when asked
if he had any witnesses, replied in the
negative.
Dr. Clark told of the .wounds on the
woman s body. .
â¢William Beverly Sharp testified that he
had known Zlegler since May of last year.
His two children lived at Ziegler's, and he
went there for a ten days' visit. He con
tinued: .,.--.-
On the evening of the killing Mr. and Mrs.
SV.esler and myself were In "the parlor, Mrs.
Armstrong, the mother of Mrs. JVegler, being
upstairs putting the children to bed. Mrs.
Z..egler made some complaint about the dog
on the stoop. She asked SVegler to take the
dog away, -us It had kept -her awake the night
before. He said he would take the dog away
later, at the Bame time asking why she 'had
not asked him while it waa daylight. Finally
the matter dropped. Mrs. Ziegler later re/er
red to the matter, again, asking me to take
the dog away. She then went out, as I eup
poFcd. to tie the dog. Mrs. Armstrong then
came into the room and I talked to her about
a fishing trip I waa to take in the morning.
It was then about 10:30 and I bade them good
night and went to ray room. . ..
I had one shoe off when Mrs. Kiegler came
to the top of the stairs and asked me if I had
gone to bed. I told her "no." She asKod for
a basket, which I gave to her. Later she
came and eot some clothes. I had Just dozed
off 'to eleep when I heard a muffled cry, as If
some persons were quarreling. Mrs. . Arm
strong came to the. foot of the stairs, saying:
"Beverly, come down. qulck._ Something dread
ful has happened. Come down, quick."
When I went downstairs I could see Zlegler
at' the dining-room door, and I said: "Judge,
Where's Cad?"
"She's down the road." was the reply.
I asked him: "What's the meaning of all
this?"
He said: "I have done the deed. There will
be no use to get the officers, for before they
get here I will be able to sever my Jugular
vein. I have never been In jail and would
.not like to bo to Jail."
'He had a knife in his hand. There was blood
on the knife and on his hands and coat sleeve.
He then raid he had caught hold of his wife
and she struck him. lie couldn't stand It.
"She fought like a wildcat," he concluded.
District Attorney Knight will nie the in
formation on Monday mornincr.

LOS ANGELES, Aug. 11.â Coroner Hol
land held an inquest this morning on the
body of John M. Slovinski, who commit
ted suicide yesterday by shooting himself.
No new facts were brought out at the in
quest, which was entirely devoid of sen
sational features. A verdict in accordance
with the facts was rendered.
Mrs. Slovinski was not present, being
under a doctor's care. Slovlnski's body
has been embalmed and will be sent East
later for burial. v > :
No trace has yet been found of the let
ters that Slovlnski wrote yesterday morn
ing before he killed himself. From this
fact it is believed that the letters were to
friends or relatives in the East, and if
that is the case they will not be heard
from for several days yet. Mrs. Slovinski

W. M. Johnson, at 533 South Main streeet,
where she was taken directly after the
shooting. She is greatly prostrated over
the affair, and when Been by your repre
sentative said:
"I cannot say a word at this time. You
are aware that I, too, am charged with
the offense alleged to have been commit
ted, and my attorneys advised me to talk
to nobody, particularly to reporters. This
much I can say, however, that I have not
received any letter from my husband and
therefore am certain he wrote none to
me. He probably Â¦wrote to relatives In
the East, mailing them before he commit
ted the act."

FROSECUTION STILL BUSY
IN THE POWERS CASE
Jury Will Probably Be Taken to the
Scene of the Goebel Assassina
tion Tuesday.
GEORGETOWN, Ky., Aug. ll.-The
prosecution In the Caleb Powers trial did
not conclude its testimony in rebuttal this
afternoon, but will do so Monday, and the
Indications are that the jury will be taken
to Frankfort Tuesday. A large number of
witnesses were heard to-day, most of
tfcern being Introduced to contradict testi
mony of witnesses for the defense.
The prosecution lays much store by the
testimony of two witnesses who testifiM
to seeing Caleb Powers with other leaders
of the mountain crowd on the evening
of January 25. The defendant himself had
testified that he was ill in his room all of
that afternoon. Several other witnesses
will be introduced Monday to further con
trcdict Powers on this point.
A number of Krankfort business men
and citizens testified that the talk of mob
violence after the assassination of Gov
ernor Goobel existed only in the minds
of those in the executive building, and
that therÂ«s was no need of the military.
Among those who testified was Sheriff
Suter, who says he swore in a posse of a
dozen citizens, and that it would have
been equal to the occasion had It not been
blocked by the actions of Adjutant Gen
eral Collier, who made the civil officers
Eubfcrvlent to the military.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Aug II.â The Heralds
correspondent in Managua, Nicaragua,
sends woro. that the Kyre-Cragin syndi
cate's canal concession was forfeited to
day because of non-payment of money
due. This leaves the >*icaraguan Govern
ment free to deal indej endently with the
United States in canal matters.
WASHINGTON. Aug. 11.â With the for
feiture of the Eyre-Crayin concession for
the construction of a Nicaragua canal,
the Nicaraguan Goverr.rrent is left free
to deal directly with the United States in
the matter of right of way. **
. While members of the Isthmian Canal
Commission will not discuss this matter
'for publication it is learned that the for
feiture of this concession clears up the
canal problem to a greater degree than
anything else that could happen.
, Objections urged in Congress against the
appropriating of money to buy off the
holders of canal concessions constituted
â¢3* of the most effective arguments
against action on the part of the United
Slates in undertaking the construction of
<a waterway.
The forfeiture of this concession, how
lÂ«ver, is not the only bright outlook in
the Isthmian canal situation. A French
company, which holds concessions on the
Panama route, upon which have been ex
pended many millions, is believed to bÂ«
'very anxious to abandon its project.
â¢ It is understood In Washington that an
'Offer mcii favorable to this country will
/Â«con be made to the State Department.
Â¦ This will put the United States on an
{Independent footing with regard to nego
itiationt, both as to the Nicaragua and
Panama routes, and it is believed will re
'duce the preliminary cost of the canal to
a great extent.
/ The State Department has not yet been
/notilied of the forfeiture of the Eyre-Cra
*pn concession. By the terms of this con
cession, however, this company was to
jhave paid $400,(XW to the Nicaraguan Gov
'ernment on August 9, or lose all its rights
I Nicaragua received $100,0uu as the first
payment. Members of the Isthmian Canal
Commission believe the Government of
.Nicaragua is anxious to make terms with
the CnlU-d States.
The fact that the commission is investi
gating and surveying every possible route
on the isthmus has caused a feeling of
uncertainty among those who have con
cessions to grant, and propositions con
taining most favorable offers may be
K'"ked for.
The work of the commission on the isth
rnus i? nearly completed. The topograph
ical field workers are now on their way
to this, country and are expected to arrive
In New York on Monday. "Work will at
once begin on the report to be made to
Congress, with a view to its completion
by December 1.
The Â«-s-.imat*<l cost o" a canal by the
Nicaraguan route has been raised by
every commission which has undertaken a
survey. The present commission has been
working on plans for a much larger canal
than â¢was estimated by the last commis
sion and there is little doubt that its es
timate will exceed the $125,000,000 reported
t<> CongTeps as the cost last winter.
The choice of routes will be narrowed
fiown to the Panama and JCicaraguan
routes, and with all private concessions
out of the way, as is now the case with
the latter, it is not unlikely that the com
mlpÂ«Ion will recommend that route.
This Leaves the Government Free to
Treat With Nicaragua, and It
Is Believed Good Terms
Can Es Made.
The Concession of the Eyre-
Cragin Company Is De
clared Forfeited.
OBSTACLE TO
ISTHMMH CANAL
IS REMOVED
San Juan and Caney Fields.
, I , thought you would probably like to
hear about the old * battlegroundsâ how
they look now. I -went to Caney and went
over the whole field on July 1. You would
scarcely recosrnlze the places. /The wire
fence , where Colonel Haskell and Dickin
son were shot has been repaired and -It Is
difficult to locate the spot. -Tho bodies
burled in. the 'pineapple field â some forty
or. moreâ have all been removed and the
trench filled up. Parts of , leggings, shoes
and other clothing of ; the dead can \ be
seen lying about. - The old stone fort is
full of weeds and is crumbling down. The
roof is entirely gone. The Spanish
trenches near it are almost ' filled up.
Government Feels It Would Be an
Imposition to Monopolize the
Japanese Dock at Kure.
WASHINGTON, Aug. ll.-The Japanese
Government has not Informed this Gov
ernment that her dock at Kure could; be
be used by the Oregon long enough .to
make permanent repairs, as published to
day. But this Government, knowing the
great value of the dock at Kure, felt that
it would be an imposition to monopolize
so valuable an adjunct of the Japanese
navy at this time, and therefore has de
cided that the Oregon shall.be only tem
porarily repaired at present. .
The word "temporary" conveys perhaps
a false impression, inasmuch aa . the re
pairs which she will undergo will be com
plete as far as they go. The repairs to
the Injuries to her hull will' be . complete
when she leaves the Kure dock, but . the
work of repairing the interior fittings to
her Injured compartments: will be post
poned until some time in t^e future. It
is said at the Xavy Department that when
she leaves the Kure dock the Oregon can
resume active service and remain in com
mission as long as may be deemed neces
sary. '

shot fired by Barbara's brother, a Con

a little old Union flag (mark this!) which
Barbara has given him. Brother and sis
ter unite to conceal the wounded man In
Barbara's room. During the rest of the
act (the best-written in the play) the in
terest of the audience Is admirably held
by keeping them guessing as to whether
Barbara will be able to preserve her lover
concealed from the many enemies who
seek his life. A Confederate search gang
is stopped by the timely arrival of an or

pleadings for her captain, and Jack Neg

The fourth act is awkwardly cut up Into
If you have not yet contributed to the fund, think
the matter over to-day and make up your mind to do
so. Up to this time the subscriptions have been lib
eral, but it is desirable that the whole $50,000 should
be contributed before the close of the coming week.
The date of the celebration is rapidly approaching,
and there is no time to spare in making preparations
for the elaborate adornments designed for the occa
sion. Promptness is therefore as important at this
time as liberality. Make up your mind to-day, and
put up your coin to-morrow. It isto be an accom
plishment in the way of a jubilee celebration that the
whole State will be proud of, and you should have
the satisfaction of knowing that in proportion to
your means you helped to make it so.
Ample preparations have been made for just such
a celebration as the most patriotic Californian can
desire. The whole State is to take part in it, and
every county will have a brilliant representation in
the display arranged by its Native Sons and the en
terprising and progressive men of the community
who help them. The one, thing for San Franciscans
to do is to prepare for their share in the celebration
or. a scale worthy of the metropolitan rank of the
city. To attain that there is needed money. The
committee in charge of the celebration asks of the
city $50,000, and in view of the large sums of money
that will be brought here by the visitors and put into
circulation through the channels of trade, that sum
is certainly none too large.
ON this day of rest from the engrossing pursuits
of business every citizen of fair means and
public spirit should give some thought to the
issues concerned in making the celebration of Admis
sion day a festival of such surpassing magnificence
that it will attract the attention of the whole Union
tc the high degree of prosperity California has at
tained. A celebration of that kind will of course be
much more than a season of gayety and pleasure. It
will be a demonstration of the rich resources of the
State, and will go far toward bringing home-seekers
and capitalists here to assist in making the develop
ment of the future^cven more rapid. and remarkable
than that of the past.
THE JUBILEE ' CELEBRATION.
On the morrow (act II) they meet in
the minister's house at Ilagerstown; but,
alas, before the knot can be tied Trumbull
The setting of the first act is charming â
a street in Frederick, Maryland, with its
quaint old. colonial houses, Corinthian
pillared and honeysuckle-bedecked. Three
Southern girls â "rather thoughtless young
creatures, but sweet-tempered and warm
hearted"âare chatting on the stoop. Bar
bara within Is playing the piano and
singing. To her enters Jack Negiey, a
hot-headed young Marylander, who soon
exits, rejected of Barbara. The lovemak
lng begins early in this play, you notice,
and continues fast and furious â such are
the exigencies of a bright-twinkling star
(Miss Marlowe), for whom the play was
â¢written. . Exits then the villain and en
ters then the hero, a Northern officer, of
course (Captain Trumbull), who quickly
wooes and wins the lovely Barbara.
Parental malediction, based on Southern
prejudice, descends upon the lovers, who
are separated, but not without a whis
pered promise from Barbara that she will
meet the captain on the morrow and
marry him.
her character. In that poem she Is spoken
of as "old Barbara Frletchie, bowed with
her fourscore years and ten"; she Is also
called "Dame" Barbara, and there Is ref
erence to her "old gray head." This being
so, it is jather startling to be told by, Mr.
Pitch that "Barbara Is a ravishing young
creature, who has more or less willingly
'upset' most of the youth of the town. A
loose, delightful curl of her wavy dark
hair lies on her white neck, held in place
by a red pink camellia." . (This really
means that her neck was held In place.)
"Her eyes arc large and beautiful, and she
does what she likes with them. Her soul
Is awakening within her, however, and her
coquetry has seen Its best days. , She Is
dressed in a billowy mass of blue gauzi
ness, bare neck, save for a blue cameo,
and bare arms, save for two lovely dim
ples." (Does this mean that the dimples
were not bare? If bo, how were they
clothed?) â¢ â¢ â¢ Now, such a Barbara
Frietchie is certainly not the image called
up to most people's minds by the mention
of that name; that Mr. Fitch could run
counter to a preconceived historical asso
ciation, could give his play an unhappy
ending, could load It up' with yards of dull
Â¦writing and could yet score Â¦with it a suc
cessâall this Implies some excellency in
the. treatment, for which he is entitled to
much credit. This excellencyâ this single
excellency â he has. and it is by far the
most important for the playwright. That
workman may not be on-good terms with
the grammar of his own language, he may
be quite incapable of getting 1 any crisp
ness or finish into his dialogue, he may
find It ever beyond his power to advance
from the sketching of type to the etching
of character, but if he has an eye for a
situation he may write a hugely success
ful play and laugh at the critics. This is
what- Mr. Fitch has done in "Barbara
Frietchie."
Here is the situation as it stands: A conspiracy
Â¦was formed to obtain fraudulent possession of the es
tate of Joseph Sullivan. The Call exposed the con
spiracy and furnished so much evidence against the
guilty parties that one of them, Chretien, confessed,
and another of them, Rogers, declines to answer
questions on the ground that he cannot be required to
incriminate himself. All the facts are matters of com
mon notoriety, and still the Bar Association does
nothing. How long is the inaction to continue?
By the delay to tr.ke action upon the offenses,
which have now been amply proven, there attaches a
disgrace to the Bar. Association, in which the most'
icspected of its members share. Why should "the
abler and more influential lawyers of the association
be silent in an emergency of this kind? Are they
afraid to begin? Â¦ Is there no one in the association
who dares to start a movement to purge it of rascals?
The Bar Association has in this matter a duty not
less important than that* which rests upon the Grand
Jury and the courts, i The public asks not only why
Rogers is not indicted for conspiracy with Chretien
and for perjury, but -why the Bar Association has
taken no steps to disbar the guilty attorneys. Is a
self-confessed criminal like Chretien fit to hold the
privilege of practicing at the California bar? Is a
man like Roger?, who refuses to answer questions for
fear that his answers would convict him of crime,
fit to continue the practice of law? Are these two men
to retain their membership in an honorable profes
sion, or are the people to understand that the profes
sion is not honorable?
Rogers is liable to indictment for conspiracy to
loot the estate of Sullivan and for committing per
jury. What he has been guilty of in the way of con
tempt of court is therefore but a minor incident in the
case. Â«Â»Thc offenses of which his own testimony and
the records of the court tend to convict him are
among the most serious of which an attorney can be
guilty. That they should be committed constitutes in
itself a serious scandal upon the administration of
justice in our probate courts and the reputation of
the bar, but if they be permitted to go unpunished the
scandal will become a thousandfold worse. The courts
and the bar will be themselves suspected of conniving
at that kind of crime, and possibly of participating
ill it.
The principles involved in the case are too impor
tant for the public to permit the affair to be set aside
without further proceedings on the part of the court,
the Grand Jury and the Bar Association. Rogers is
under suspicion of offenses far worse than contempt of
court, and the suspicions are founded largely upon his
own testimony. He swore in court that he had neither
received any money' nor been promised any to consent
to the dismissal of thi objections he had filed against
the distribution of the estate of Joseph Sullivan to
the alleged heir Chretien had brought forward. That
testimony has been contradicted by witnesses who de
clare he did receive money for that express considera
tion. Furthermore, Rogers, when before the Grand
Jury and when before the court after the evidence
against him had been made known, refused to answer
questions concerning the case, and based his refusal
upon the ground that he cannot be required to
incriminate himself.
HAVING served the five days' imprisonment to
which he was' sentenced for contempt of court
in refusing to answer questions in the Chretien
case, Attorney James Taylor Rogers is once more at
liberty. The questions asked him remain unanswered,
and it remains to be seen what the court will do
should he again show himself in contempt if the ques
tions be repeated.

THE FRESNO PARRICIDE.
THE Greeks provided no punishment for parri
cide, refusing to believe that any child account
able for its acts or comprehending them could
ever be guilty of taking the life of its parent.
There is a long stretch of history between the time
of the Greek commonwealth and now. but it is prob
able that the records of crime furnish but little that
can go to controvert the philosophy of the Greeks.
Children have taken the lives of parents in all ages
and in every nation, but it is doubtful if the elements
of comprehension and accountability have been
present.
In the light of. the researches of Lombroso and
other students of abnormal and degenerate man, it is'
doubtful whether these classes, which supply a ma
jority of our criminals and recidivists of our prisons,
can be held accountable for a moral comprehension
of the crimes they commit. A parricide has
recently been hanged at San Quentin. He was pun
ished properly, and his hanging was justified because
society is not under any obligation to support and
preserve the lives of monsters. But the facts in his
case make it clear that he was a degenerate, in whom
the primal abnormal germ had been developed by de
bauchery and vicious courses. The recent attempt of
Strassman to murder his blind father is another case
of the same kind. His degenerate tendency has been
reinforced by an abandoned and vicious life, until the
element of moral responsibility had vanished.
The most painful of recent cases is that of the
Himes children at Fresno. One of them may be dis
missed from the discussion because of his childish
years. Children of that age have killed each other in
sport, lacking the judgment to foresee the conse
quences of the acts which caused death. They have
been known to play hanging and strangle to death a
playmate, who willingly submitted to have the noose
put upon his neck and be drawn up. And there have
been cases in which children, imitating the beheading
of fowls, have decapitated a comrade. These are the*
thoughtless acts of immaturity, due, probably, to a.
lack of parental caution and instruction which would
have admonished them of the danger of such things.
The case of the elder Himes boy, however, presents
the features of degeneracy. He desired to achieve the
ownership of his father's team and wagon, planned a
use of the property profitable to himself, and nego
tiated a partnership with his cousin, who had pro
vided part of the capital necessary for the venture.
His abnormal mind seems to have been completely
occupied by a precocious scheme that was to benefit
himself, and he never morally considered the awful
means by which he was to achieve it. His father
stood in the way. His removal seemed to be a trifling
matter. He broached it to his younger brother and
his cousin, dwelling upon the material advantage it
would be to them all to own the team and earn money
with it for themselves*. Listening to his persuasion,
they naively confess that they thought it would be .1
good plan, and the two brothers thereupon took crim
inal means, by the theft of junk, to raise the few cents
necessary to buy the poison. The elder brother ex
hibited most precocious qualities. With the most re
markable nerve he administered the first dose of poi
son, and continued to give it to his suffering and un
suspecting father. When the exposure came he had
the cunning to give another than the real reason, de
claring that his father lfated and abused him. His
foresight told him that such a plea would favorably
affect those who were to judge him. The mind, in a
boy of his age, which could conceive and carry out
such a plan and cunningly devise such mitigating in
cidents when exposed is at once seen to be abnormal
and degenerate. To his conscience the scheme was
not presented as the murder of his father, but the pos
session of property which he coveted. He did not
regard himself as a parricide, for he was merely taking
a step to make himself the owner of a team to be
used for his own benefit. Had the scheme succeeded,
he .vould no doubt later on have killed his young part
ner in order that he might be the sole owner of the
property, and would have felt no moral compunction,
because to his degenerate conceptions the prospective
good to himself was the greatest consideration.
The difficult problem for the law to solve is the
proper disposition of him. The sentiment of the com
munity recoils from hanging a child of his tender
years. To put him in one of the State schools is
hardly the proper thing, for it would introduce him
to the society of many who are the victims of circum
stances and bad training, and who have the capacity
for complete reform and good citizenship. There
seems no alternative but his lifelong confinement
in a prison, where he and his crime wilNbe forgotten.
THflT JUDICIARY SCriEME.
THE l^st Legislature passed two amendments to
the constitution bearing upon the proposed
change in our judicial system, one at the regu
lai and one at the special session. These amendments
conflict, and there is a conilict of opinion as to which
should be offered to the voters, or it both should be.
Ii both are offered ard adopted, the maze of legal
complications resulting will be appalling. We arc
convinced that neither should be adopted. The addi
tion of nine appellate Justices to our judicial system
carries a burden of taxation not justified by any bene
fits that will foilo'.v.
We have pointed out the folly of cutting out and
stitching a judicial garment for this State as ample
as that required for the State of New York. The
same subject has bee:i discussed by other States.
Iowa, with a population of two millions and a quar
ter, has a Supreme Court of six Judges. Last year
it had on its docket 766 cases. At a recent meeting of
the Ear Association of that State the relief of the
court was discussed. Three plans were considered â
First, increase the number of Justices; second, limit
the cases in which appeals may be taken; third, create
an intermediate 2ppelhte court. In the event of the
adoption of the third plan an appellate court of three
Judges was favored, elected for six years, with a salary
of $4000.
The last Legislature had before it an amendment to
effect this, which passed the House but fell in the
Senate. The association did not, however, indorse
this plan, while pointing out its necessary features if
finally adopted.
Surely ii that great State can get along with appel
late courts aggregating nine Justices in all, California
does not need an establishment of eighteen!
In the discussions in the Iowa Bar Association it
vres shown that more efficient help would come by re
form in judicial procedure, and by securing on the
bench of the courts of first instance Judges vrhose
knowledge of the science of law would be so much
respected as to stop many appeals by the authority of
their decisions upon many issues upon which neither
court nor attorney is certain, and which, therefore, are
passed cp to the final court. Perhaps that is one dif
ficulty here. Attorneys arc permitted to indulge in
long arguments with the object of enlightening the
court, feeling that the bench is just as uncertain as
themselves, and after much waste of time an exception
is taken from the ruling r Judge and all being in doubt,
but willing to burden the court of last resort with a
matter that should never be carried past the point of
original jurisdiction.
It is true that the taxpayers elect the Judges, but
when they appreciate the importance to them of high
talent and training on the bench, they will more care
fully discriminate in the nomination and election of
Judges.
These necessary reforms are not advanced by the
proposed medley of amendments. They dsal with
symptoms and leave the disease unmended. Indeed
they threaten its aggravation by the new litignbie
issues they will inevitably raise. We do not desire
for California the bad eminence implied in a cumber
some, cosily and inefficient judicial system, which '11
patched end added to '.vithout regard to the true prin
ciples of its reform, and every patch and addition
costing the taxpayers without increasing their chance
to get justice in the courts.
It is our expectation that the people will refuse
ratification of cither of these propositions, and it is our
hope that the real lawyers will be heard from in oppo
sition, r.nd that hearing them the people will be en
lightened upon the elements of a genuine reform.
The legal profession cf the State will not permit it
self to be suspected of promoting the multiplication of
judicial positions, because it has the monopoly of fill
ing them. It is a profession specially charged with
the application to the issues between men of a science
that originated for the purpose of securing human
rights and making property safe in its legitimate
ownership. Being such, it will refuse to be ranked
with the mere greedy who seek their own aggrandize-
ment, regardless of the. public welfare.
TIME TO COME WEST.
T~~\EPORTS from :he East concerning the weather
V~J are almost as fearful as those which tell of
fighting in the Philippines, or even in South
Africa itself in these later days. The summer has
been unusually severe all over the country east of the
Mississippi, and of late the heat has been intensified
at spells by successive hot waves, originating evi
dently in hades, and sweeping impartially over the
crowded cities and the summer resorts, so that those
who stay at home and those who seek the seaside or
the mountains get an equal treatment.
In New York on Thursday there was a combina-.
tion of heat and humidity that made a record almost
unparalleled in that city. Only one death from sun
stroke occurred during the day, but several persons
were prostrated by the heat and nearly all business
was suspended. In the city of Philadelphia there
were three deaths and twenty prostrations during the
day, and in the suburban towns the record was fully
as bad. In the manufacturing city of Chester the big
mills shut down and all work was stopped.
In the cities of the Upper Mississippi Valley the
record was even worse than on the Atlantic coast.
Reports of deaths and prostrations come from Cleve
land, Detroit and Milwaukee, but the worst effects of
the hot wave appear in Chicago. From that city it
is learned that in one day there were four deaths and
twenty-nine prostrations, three of which are expected
to result fatally. The total number of deaths due
directly to the heat for the week is seventeen, and it is
estimated that indirectly the heat has caused during
the week the deaths of upward of 100 persons. Gang?
of workingmen are laid off every afternoon, and the
effect upon the business of the city is reported as
being "extremely serious."
Of course the reports that tell of prostrations and
deaths on the streets do not by any means make up
the full record of the effects of the heat. Hundreds
of persons are stricken in their homes â¢> whose names
do not become known to the public. In all the
Eastern cities it is noted that the death rate is mount
ing rapidly since the hot waves began, and in Chicago'
it is estimated the number of deaths for the week will
reach 6oo, while in the previous week it was 465.
We arc fond of boasting of our glorious California
climate, but it is doubtful if we fully appreciate its
value until some such contrast as that afforded; by
the reports from the East is brought to*public atten
tion. California should be widely advertised for' its
summer weather. ;Thousands.of persons visit the
southern part of the State in the winter to escape the
rigors of that season of the East, but comparatively

The. bracing breeziness of a San Francisco "summer

wise every midsummer would find thousands of men
and women from that section enjoying here a com

effects of hot waves.

Confederates are advancing; soon their
sharpshooters occupy the house and the
very room where Barbara is left forlorn.
A deserter from Captain Trumbull's com
pany, one Gelivex, seizes a coign of van
tage behind a shutter and draws a bead
on him as he comes charging up the street
at the head of his rallied men. Barbara en
treats. Implores Gelivex not to shoot. He
refuses and is about to fire, when Bar

right arm and thus saves her lover for

HE Life Publishing Company of New
Tork i has brought out in most at-
I tractive form Clyde Fitch's four-act
I tragedy, "Barbara Frietchle, the
I Frederick Girl." In spite of some
1 crudities, this play is one on which
Mr. Fitch is to be congratulated, for
It marks a decided advance from the medi
ocrities of "Beau Brummel" and the atro
cities of "The Moth and the Flame."
Although it is now, I think, generally
acknowledged that the story of Barbara
Frietchle is as much a myth as Is that oÂ£
Tell and the apple or of George "Washing
ton and the cherry tree, It Is equally cer
tain that Whlttler's fine poem has crys
tallized forever the popular conception of

CLYDE FITCH'S NEW PLAY
two scenes. In the first Trumbull dies:
Barbara bends over the bed and slowly
drags away from Trumbull's body the
blood-stained, ragged flag she had given
him; clasping It to her bosom, breathing
with difficulty and suppressing her sobs,
she goes across and out of the room. In
the second scene (the street of act I)
Stonewall Jackson comes riding by and
Barbara raises the flag that had bound
her lover's wound, crying to the angry
crowd: "Shoot! You've taken a life al
ready dearer to me than my own. Shoot
and I'll thank you, but spare your flag."
Jackson then utters h!s historic saying;
hardly said, when Jack Negiey (quite
mad) shoots Barbara, and 13 himself or
dered to be shot by his own father.
'Tis a most unhappy and a most beauti
fully logical ending. Mr. Fitch. I salute
you for having the courage not to writo
a most beautifully illogical, happy end-
Ing, Just to please the audience, as you
did In "The Moth and the Flame." In tha
way you are now going lies all the success
worth having, apropos of which. I com
mend to you this story of Scribe and Al
fred de Musset. Said Scribe one day to
De Musset: "How do you manage It? X
write with no Idea but to amuse the peo
ple, and yet I cannot make them laughj
as you do." "Ah," replied De ilusset,
"but I write to amuse myself."

The Government has several warehouses
in this city, but they are all full to over
flowing, and there is great difficulty In
handling the Government traffic. The
heavy, artillery is here and ready to go
forward, and the regular army troops are
well on their way to this port, the under,
standing being- that there will be no delay
in their departure.
Large quantities of supplies are coming
from the East. ; These include about forty
cars of, canned goods every thirty days
the capacity ; of â¢ each car being 40,000
pounds. It should not be understood that
the railroad and steamship activity iÂ»
confined to this port, for it Is not. Con
tracts, have now been let which call for
fourteen:- transports to convey freight
from the Sound ; ports to China waters.
These ships will carry largely the forage
for the cavalry that has been obtainable
In - the Northwest, but the bulk of the
feed i for the I horses is to come from 1 the
Western States. The Government is now
advertising for bids for the supply of such
provender for delivery at this port. ;
By reason of these mighty preparations
being made by the Government for a pos
sible prolonged war there is and will be
for some time great activity, in this city
among those who deal in and transport
the .munitions of war. As a. prominent
railroad man put the situation yesterday:
"When great railroad lines are so pressed
with traffic for the Government that they
cannot ; handle It with satisfaction, not
withstanding great facilities, it can prop
erly be Inferred Â¦ that there . Is - 'something
doing* that Is worth talking of."
Of course the activityÂ»In transport ser
vice Is noticeable, but it is not generally
known that the demands upon the rail
road companies, not only transcontinen
tal but those in the Western States, Is so
great that it is almost impossible to han
dle the traffic. There are thousands of
troops on the rail now, bound for San
Francisco, but the freight trains bearing
commissary supplies and the munitions
of war are not announced. A great part
of these supplies are drawn from the
warehouses of Chlckamauga, where the
Government stored up vast stocks of food
to feed the thousands of hungry soldiers
who went to Cuba to punish the haughty
dons. These supplies are now being
brought forward and sent to the land of
the Mongol to sustain the men who are
destined to teach a painful lesson to the
misguided Asiatic.
To the casual observer Uncle Sam does
not appear to be doing anything in par
ticular in connection with the Chinese
situation, save to Bend a few thousand
troops from Manila and this port. There
is little on the surface save diplomacy,
but the emblematic gentleman, with the
pyrotechnic coat and trousers, has "a
move on," the speed of which compares
well with that which whipped Spain in
less than a hundred days.

Sixty stewards and privates of the Hos
pital Corps from various parts of the Kast
were sent to Fort McDowell this morn
ing awaiting transportation abroad.
Dr. Rowe, a contract surgeon lately ar
rived here from Manila, was ordered un
der arrest this morning by Major GIrard,
surgeon In charge of the General Hos
pital. The doctor had been Indulging too
freely and amused himself by taking oft
his blouse, putting it on any of the col
ored troopers who happened to be near
and then saluting him. This all happened
In the saloons just outside the entrance
to the Presidio and soon came to thÂ« ears
of Lieutenant Collins, who sent an am
bulance for the bibulous medico, who was
placed under arrest. He will, In all prob
ability, be sent to his home in Utah.
The new steam-heating apparatus at
the General Hospital will be in operation
for the first time to-morrow.
Siege Battery O is in camp at the Pre
sidio, under command of Captain J. R.
Williams, First Lieutenant C. C. Hearn
and Second Lieutenant P. R. Ward. They
brought with them sixty-five mules and
sixty-five heavy draft horses- to transport
the four 7-lnch howitzers, each of which,
ready for service, weighs 9000 pounds.
J. V. Cannon, a private of Company F,
Sixteenth Infantry, an inmate of the gen
eral hospital, suffering from a wound i/i
the leg, was allowed to leave the Pre
sidio on Friday nisht. In some unac
countable manner his crutch slipped,
throwing him to the ground, breaking the
already Injured leg.
Employes of the quartermaster's de
partment at the Presidio on going to work
at 7 a. m. yesterday found Thomas Ashe
lying unconscious in one of the corrals.
He was carried to the post hospital, where
on examination it was found that no
bones were broken. His chest was bruised
and greatly discolored. He remained in
an unconscious state all day and nothing
could be learned as to how he was In
jured. The doctors fear he is hurt in
ternally. His fellow-teamsters think he
was kicked by one of the horses.

The proprietor of the shop has no the
ory to offer. He Is completely mystified,
and is Inclined to blame Dycho for oarp
leFsncss In hanging up In a public place
so valuable a diamond.
The side of the shop in front of the
chairs is a solid mirror. Barbers and
customers face it. and th* hooks on the
other side of the narrow shop are in plain
view to all of them. It is a mystery how
the robbery could have been committed
without the deed being seen. The dan
ger of detection in the act makes the
tlWt an exceedingly daring one.
Dyche made his loss known at once,
but no one had seen any one else near
the hook where the cravat had been
hanging. The salesman went to the of
fice of the Chief of Police, and Detective
Reynolds was detailed to help him find
the thief. One of the barbers volunteered
the information that he had sat down in
the chair beneath the hook where the col
lar and cravat were hanging after he had
finished shaving his man. and he and the
porter were searched, but to no purpose.
the theft was committed, and so far as
the barbers remember there was no one
waiting. Two men who were being shaved
left before Dyche discovered his loss,
both of them being men well-known in
the shop. One was a Grass Valley mer
chant and the other a Sacramento young
man. Suspicion Is not directed toward
either of them.

from the store from time to time and
pawned them, and from the pawn tickets
in his possession the detectives recovered
ten men's gold watches, two ladies' gold

by Arnheim on these articles was $203 bO.
There are other articles yet to be re

It Absolutely Prohibits the Importa

and Sausage.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 11.â The main
provisions of the meat law, recently
passed by the German Government,- af
affectlng among other things the absolute
prohibition of American canned meats
and sausages, will take effect October I

the Department of Agriculture through
the State Department of the publication
In the Berliner Reichsanzeiger of an im
perial proclamation iixlng that as the
date when the prohibition of what has
heretofore been an important trade will
be effective. The most important feature
of the law Is paragraph 1 of section 12,
which is as follows:
The importation through the custom houses
of meats In airtight sealed cans or other ves
sels, of sausages and other mixtures made from
finely cut meat, is prohibited.
The following sections also become ef
fective October 1: Section 2G. paragraphs
1 and 2, the penal clause, imposing a pen
alty for violation of the new provisions to
the extent of imprisonment for six
months or a fine of 1500 marks or* both.
Section 2S, setting forth that the confisca-
J? n , ? f the meat Is to be understood in
addition to the penalty. It declares that
it is immaterial whether the object
seized belongs to the offender or not. and
ir the prosecution of any person or the
condemnation of articles be imprac

M. Martin of Watsonville, who Installed' the
new officers. After the Installation a bannuet
was enjoyed at the Odd Fellows' Hall.
Lp to a late hour this afternoon Mr
Black had not filed the threatened damage
suit apainst Mr. Murphy or Constable Mc-
Donald.
All this talk about lynching and an anÂ«-v
crowd In sheer nonsense. When I took charjre
of Mr. Black there were not more than four
persons who saw us. The matter had been
reported to me. and as kidnaping is a felony
It was my duty to act as I did. I took Mr
Black to the Murphy home to have him identi-
Iie<3 and ascertain whether they were coins to
prefer a charge against him.
The younst man was afterward brought here
by Constable McDonald and stoutly denied that
ho had ever insulted a woman. However he
apologized for his language ami went hla way.
There was no violent lar.g-uaj;e useO or aiiv
threats made. We are eorry lor the publicity
clvcn the matter.
Constable McDonald, who arrested Mr
Black, said:

the young man commenced a conversation with
him. After he was there several hours he- in
vited the child for a walk. V.'e did not miss
the boy until a lady, who has since left the
valley, came running to the house and told
uÂ«, to go in search of the boy; that a man had
been' seen taking him away. My dauchter
Irene went up the hill and across on the other
side found the boy and the stranger. She up
braided the roan for taking the child away

DENY THAT BLACK WAS '
IN DANGER OF VIOLENCE
The object of the Government in prompt
ly rejecting the bids is taken to mean :v
determination to bring the contractors tc
reasonable terms. On the other hand, it
is said by some officials of the department
that the Government will probably be
willing to make considerable concessions
before adopting the serious alternative
of establishing a plant of its own.
Contractors Asked for Too Large a
Proportion of the Entire Amount
Called For.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 11.â The Navy
Department to-day decided to reject all
bids for armor plate presented to the de
partment. It Is stated at the department
that this does not mean that the alterna
tive plan of erecting a Government armor
plate factory will be adopted, although
the Secretary of the Navy has at his dis
posal $1,000,000, with which to start such
a plant In case satisfactory terms cannot
be made with the private manufacturers.
It is stated to-day that new advertise
ments will be Issued as speedily as possi
ble, and the contractors will be given an
other chance to put their bids into such
shape as will be acceptable to the Govern
ment.
The reason assigned for the rejection of
bids is the demand from all the bidders
for too large a proportion of the entire
amount of armor plate. The lowest bid
der, the Midvale Steel Company, was not
satisfied to accept less than 20,000 tons of
the 36,000 tons to be contracted for. At the
rate of delivery proposed by the Midvale
Company the Government could not have
got its armor to complete the ships
now in course of construction within a
reasonable time. The other two bidders,
the Bethlehem and Carnegie companies,
were much higher in their figures and in
sisted on having the whole amount of
armor divided between them on equal
terms.
BIDS FOR ARMOR PLATE
ARE ALL REJECTED
Alleged They Were Not Accorded
Equality of Treatment During^
the Bubonic Plague Scare.
"WASHINGTON. Aug. 11.â At a confer
ence to-day with Assistant Secretary
Adee, the Japanese Minister brought up
the matter of alleged Injustice to the
Japanese residents of San Francisco in
connection with the plague quarantine
measures enforced In that city. The Min
ister represented that the Japanese were
not being accorded equality of treatment
by the San Francisco authorities.
Mr. Adee explained that the matter was
specially called to the attention of the
Governor of California some time ago by
the State Department and the quaran
tine measures adopted by the city or
State authorities were entirely in the
hands of the Stato or city governments.
Mr. Adee to-night declined to discuss the
conference.
SAYS JAPANESE WERE
DISCRIMINATED AGAINST
But the million or two left behind in
the city were obliged to suffer. The rec
reation piers were packed, but they gave
little relief. The keeper of an East Side
pier said that the thermometer there ha;]
registered 102 during the day. Not a
rustle of a breeze could be detected.
The greatest sufferers were the chil
dren.
Within the four days during which the
heat has been oppressive there has been
an average of sixty-six child patients at
Bellevue Dispensary alone, the ages of
the children ranging from 5 months to 2
years.
There was more humidity to-day than
has previously been registered, it being
I'S per cent early In the morning and ad
vancing during the day. Many horses
were sunstruck.

NEW YORK, Aug. 11.â Death reaped a
harvest to-day from New York's humid

from fire escapes on which they had
crowded to get. some relief from the tor
turing heat.
Since August 6, when tne temperature

growing worse. All in all, it Is the hot
test continuous weather New York has
had. All local weather records for this
year were broken. The thermometer
reached 95 at 2 p. m. and registered the
same figures, an hour later. This was
the official record taken by the bureau,
high above the street, and is many
degrees cooler than the temperature the
people were subjected to on the streets.
The fact that it was a half holiday
raved many from Hie wilting heat of
offices and factories. Thousands hur

HONOLULU. Aug. 4.â The Republicans
of Honolulu held a' grand rally and rati

returned from the national convention.
There was a torchlight procession and a
largely attended meeting, at which plenty
of enthusiasm was shown.
Lax Quarantine Laws.
HONOLULU. Aug. 4.â Much discussion
Â¦was occasioned here by receipt of advices
from Sydney by the steamer Aorangi
thowing the policy pursued there with re
card to declaring the port free from the
bubonic plague. After ten days without
a case, instead of thirty-one as was Ho
nolulu's rule, the port was declared free
and though other cases arose afterward
Sydney is still officially clean. It is stated
tt Sydney that international law allows
the declaring of the port clean in Buch a
case, as the disease Is not "epidemic."
According to this construction. Honolulu
suffered several months of needless quar
antine, as the plague here was sporadic
during most of the time while it was de
clared to exist. Quarantine in Honolulu
was not raised till there had not been a
case for thirty days.
Odd Judicial Blunder.
HONOLULU. Aug. 4.â Judge Little of
HIlo has furnished amusement for Hono
lulu by a curious error In the making out
of a legal document. The document Is a
mittimus in the case of a Japanese named
Fujihara, who is to be handed at Hilo
next month. The Judge addresses High
Sheriff Brown of the Territory in thÂ»
mittimus, with the words "and may God
have mercy on you soul."
ports for the month of June and July
chow an alarming increase in the death
rate, especially among native Hawaiians
and Japanese of the island of Oahu. which
has the only complete records. In June
the number of deaths per thousand was
45. in July 49. The increase for the past
few years, as shewn by tables just com
piled, has aroused a good deal of discus
sion. In 1SS6 the July deaths numbered 4S
Kince then the figures have jumped to 53
75, Â£3. and this year 114.
Consumption heads the list of diseases,
causing deaths in almost every month,
end there is agitation for strict measures
to quarantine patients. The Board of
Health Is discussing a quarantine against
consumption, as many people como here
from other places to enjoy the mild cli
mate, and it Is believed that they are a
eource of danger to the population. Ty
phoid fever has also claimed a good many
victims lately, a Blight epidemic having

INCREASE OF DISEASE.
HONOLULU. Aug:. 4.â The steamship
Aoraniri of the Canadian-American line,
plying between Victoria and Sydney
and calling here, has puzzled the people
ci Honolulu by her actions on her last
trip, passing through here the day before
yesterday. She carefully stayed outside
the harbor, beyond the three-mils legal
limit, and her captain stated that the Lon
don oSice of his company had cabled to
him at Sydney, Instructing him not to call
at Honolulu.
The local agents finally persuaded him
to make a Custom-house entry and take
passengers, though he refused to enter
ihe harbcr. As a result of his order re
ceived at. Sydney there is something of a
ehortag-e of mutton here, as a large ship
ment was expected, as usual, from Aus
tralia. The iiiowera of the same line ar
rived to-day from Victoria and stayed
outside in the eame way, entering later.
It is supposed that the company fears a
libel by the plaintiffs in the twenty-seven
damage suits brought by the Ilpgan rnin-
Ftrels, on account of their being refused
passage from here during plague times.

public a letter in which he declares the
silver question Is no longer a paramount
issue and will not be for years to come.
The Silver Republican party is being kept
alive for this campaign, he says, simply
to aid the Democratic party, and on the
question of expansion; which is named as
paramount in its platform, he does not
agree with the Democratic party.

1 L^BgSfffByiTMrf'Wiffliirirr' Â¦â¢Â¦'"Â¦ - â iâ â â â â â âMajor L. S. Schmitt of the division staff
has been detailed to preside at an election
to be held for captain and three lieuten
ants in Troop C at Salinas, their terms
having expired.
E. C. Sutllffe, captain commanding Com
pany C. First Regiment of Infantry, has
tendered his resignation.
George Schwerdtfeger has been recom
mended for battalion adjutant of the
First Infantry.
Target practice Is being badly neglected
by the California guardsmen. Since the
promotion some time ago of J. A. Hosmer.
who was Inspector of rifle practice, there
has been no work at the targets by sol
diers of the Second Brigade. â¢
ed as assistant surgeon in the sanitary
corps, with the rank of captain, for serv
ice with Troop A Cavalry. John D.
Mathews, elected first lieutenant of Com
pany K of the Seventh Infantry, has suc
cessfully passed the board of examiners,
as has also . Herbert J. Bedwell, elected
Becond lieutenant of Company M of the
Seventh. Major L. W. Juilllard of the
Fifth Infantry has 'qualified before the
board.
From various qources it appears that
the entire National Guard of California
would like to participate In the Admission
day parade, but at this time It Is appa
rent that only the First Regiment Of In
fantry, Troop A Cavalry and the signal
corps of the Second Brigade will be in line
as the representatives of. the State militia.
There is a possibility that the Fifth Regi
ment may be in line. The question of
funds to pay for transportation of , the
troops from their respective localities to
this city and return has been a stumbling
block. Three of the companies of the
Fifth Regiment are on the line. of a rail
road company that has generously agreed
to, bring these companies to; this city and
return them free of charge. The others
are on the lines of another transportation
company that has not made so. generous
an offer. . Whether the three :, companies
will turn out has not yet been decided.
The finance: committee of the celebra
tion does not las : yet feel warranted to
make any allowance r for transportation
for the Guard. It has been calculated
that Â¦ to bring the erent , organizations
of the Third Brigade and return them to
their Beveral localities would cost 54764.
There is a provision of the code which
says that on occasions of ceremonies and
public celebrations the brigade command
ers may order their respective commands
to- take part, but it does not make any
provision for transportation."- It. has been
suggested that the Governor as command
er in v chief has the power Â¦'< to order the
National Guard to parade on September
10 and: that he could pledge the credit of
; the State for Â¦, the payment â¢ of transporta
tion until t the Legislature makes an ap
propriation' for that: purpose. 'â¢ It is possi
ble that' an" appeal will be made Uo' the
'Governor.:.- If -not' It Is possible that If the
finance committee of; the -celebration Â¦will
appropriate a>part of the .amount: re
quired for. transportation the several.or

tended to investigate not alone his action
in the case, but would probe the entlr-j
matter so far as the Jury was concerned.
venire be submitted to him Monday at
noon, because his state of health might
Interfere with him trying the case and
he might have to assign It to another
Judge.
Attorney Â¦ Collins Â«ald he - was â¢ ready to
proceed at any . time : convenient to the
Judge.. * After, further talk*, the Judge set
the case for next .Wednesday afternoon
at 2 o'clock, -and Issued a venire for
seventy-five Jurors. He asked that . the
Schwartz's case was called before Judge
Conlan yesterday morning. : Attorney Cof
fey asked for a speedy trial, as there were
a number of cases, each to be tried by a
lury, and by the way they, are being tried
It would take months to get through with
them. The evidence in each case Is sim
ple, but the attorney for the defense In
troduced so many legal points that much
time was wasted. ',-,:.
Chief Sullivan has determined to probe
to the bottom the scandal in connection
with the alleged "fixing" of the jury in
the Henry Schwartz poolselling case. He
and Captain Seymour and Attorney Jo
seph Coffey had a consultation yesterday
morning, and it was decided to ask Juror
Harry Baum to call at the Chief's office
to be interviewed. Detective Crockett
was detailed to find Baum yesterday aft
ernoon, but was not successful. It ls pos
sible that the Grand Jury may be asked
to make an investigation into the case
W. A. Â¦Â¦Walker and J. F. Kingston, two
of the jurors, called upon the Chief yes
terday morning to explain that a mistake
had been made in. charging Juror Kings
ton with being one of the three who stood
for acquittal. Kingston voted straight
through for conviction. The three who
voted for acquittal' were Baum. ilengola
andR. J. Hutchlnson. 1104 Market street.
Mengola. it is said, declared in the jury
room that he would not give any verdict
but "not guilty"; and Hutchinson, it is
also claimed, openly declared from the
start that he was for "not guilty." It is
also charged that Baum .tried to lead the
other jurors to believe that he was voting
for guilty till he was found out voting the
other way. ;
Bailiff Fleming of Judge Cabaniss*
court, who served the venire,' , told the
Chief yesterday that when he served
Baum with the summons Baum said:
"Oh, I can fix that all rieht. I'll not serve
on that Jury- I know what to do." When
Fleming returned to the City Hall he was
more than surprised to see Baum talking
in the corridor to. the, pool; men, and he
made no attempt to be excused. .
Probability of the Matter Being Laid
Before the Grand Jury â The
Case Is Again Set for
Trial. .
Chief Sullivan Determined
to Make a Thorough
Investigation.

Albert Bosseau Severely Injured
"While at Work in the Hold
of the Aztec.
Albert Rosseau, a stevedore, while at
work yesterday in No. 4 hatch on the Az
tec, was seriously injured by a falling
bucket of coal. His skull was cut open
and he sustained numerous contusions.
That he was not killed i3 considered mi
raculous by all who witnessed" the acci
dent, as the contents of the bucket nearly
buried him.
Rosseau and two fellow workmen had
> just filled the hoist and it was being raised
I upward, preparatory to dumping its con
1 tents into the bunkers on the wharf. The
rope by which It was being raised broke.
Both Rosseau's . companions escaped In-

Receiving Hospital, where seventeen
stitches were put, in his head. He will

tion with the present condition of the or
ganization, and encouraged the members
to continue work along the present lines.

GRAND ASSEMBLY OF

Criminal Tried to Injure His Land-
Iad7 by Setting Fire to Her
Home.
Joseph Fitzgerald, whose criminal ten
dencies finally resulted in his conviction
on a charge of arson in the lirst degree,
Â¦was sentenced yesterdav to Eerve twenty
years in San Cjucr.tin by Judge William P.
Lawlor. c*n the night Â«jf May 6 last Fitz

This house adjoined that occupied by Mrs.
Era Jannsen, against whom the convict
h>ld a grudps, as Mrs*. Jannsen. as Fiiz
gi-rald's landlady, had demanded that he
pay his rent. By pelting fire to the Beach
home Fitzgerald hoped to destroy that oc
cupied by his landlady. Fitzgerald sat
muttering la court yesterday and Bailiff
Joseph \V. Windrcn finally forced him to
keep quiet.
In passing sentence Judge Lawlor took
Into consideration the nature of the con
vict's crime and passed sentence accord

JOSEPH FITZGERALD
GETS TWENTY YEARS
The report of the July business of the
Pucnte Oil Company's refinery at Chlno
f=hows that 5000 gallons of reiined oil were
turned out on an average per day. Nearly
all the pumping plants in the Ohino sec
tion get thexr supplies there and fuel oil
is hauled to points as distant as Lords
burg and Azusa. Residuum oils have been
shipped out because the sugar refinery
was not running. Some of the residuum
went to San Pedro en route for San
Francisco, to be used for fuel. Twenty
two carloads of -Â»fined oil were recently
shipped in one day.
The Bakersfield Callfornlan says there
is an association of Tulare people who are
bewailing their luck. "A number of years
ago they contracted to buy every odd sec
tion in twenty-eight, and kept up their
payments for a long time. Finally, when
tne sheep business had run down, the land
would not yield interest and was turned
back. The railroad offered all sorts of
concessions to induce them to stay with
their proposition, but they were deter
mined to get out of it and they did. thus
letting at least 55.000,000 slip through their
lingers."
These figures are on the basis of the
present values of oil lands in that locality.
The Los Angeles oil exchanges finally
decided not. to combine. The Los Angeles
Tines says the first result was that the
IÂ»s Angc'.es Oil Exchange has increased
'ts membership, and in consequence the
California Oil and Stock Exchange Â»s suf
fering the loss of almost two score of Its
brokers. This loss is an outgrowth of the
failure , to effect a consolidation of the
two exchanges. When that movement
met defeat an unofficial proposition was
offered, asking the Los Angeles Exchange
to make known how. many members of
the California Exchange would be accept
able to the former body. The old ex
change declined to "separate the -groats
from the sheep," so another tack was
made, resulting more successfully. ..A
committee from the California Exchange
then offered a list of sixty-five names aa
A convention of the oil men of the State
is proposed. The purpose of such a gath
ering will be to lay before the United
States Land Commissioner the facts in
the controversy between the oil men and
ihe scrippers. The idea has met with
favor in Southern California. Other mat
ters pertaining to the oil industry may be
discussed, but the paramount issue is to
clear up the present tangle.
A part of the text of the decision ren
dered by Judge Day at Santa Barbara, in
the suit of the Acme Oil and Mining Com
pany against H. L. Williams et al., is
given herewith because of the interesting
question and the large interests involved
wherever beach mining for oil exists in
this State. Said Judge Day:
The locus in quo of thlÂ« action iÂ« tide
land* and a paxt of the Paciflc Ocean not
subject, in the abeeace of sovereign grant,
to private ownership. Whatever title there
is bclonss to the State for the use of ail Its
inhabUanta eubject to a right in the gen
eral Government to regulate commerce ana
navigation. No presumption exleta to the
contrary. Courts cannot presume title, ex
clusive possession or exclusive right of pos
eetsion in the individual to this class of
PI ?{ie may grant rights and privi
leges, and even title, but it Is not its portcy
to do po and when Euch grant Is relied on.
it must be shown affirmatively. Possession
of lands subject to cultivation and exclusive
ownership Is jrrima. facie evidence of title
and right of possession, but there can be no
exclusive right of possession In and to the
tide lands and sea. Consequently any actual
or constructive possession thereof or of any
l-art thrreof. not dependent on actual grant,
must be presumed to be a. common posses
sion or right based upon an Implied license
or permission from the State and general
Government, and as beneficiaries under the
State'* holding. Such possession or assumed
posEeesion doea not tend to prove title or
exclusive right of possession. There are no
sufcial licenses or permissions shown or re
litfi on in this action, hence the parties
must bt preeumed to rely on their natural
rights and the Implied permission of com
mon possession, occupation and right of
mining, the plaintiff's being only equal to
defenaant'8 and not euperlor to any one's.

possible applicants for seats. Of that
number the Los Angeles Exchange ap
proved of fifty-one and returned the list
with fourteen names scratched.
At the meeting of the old exchange
thirty-eight applications were received,
and later passed, admitting them to mem
bership in the Los Angeles Exchange. The
thirty-eight have signed the by-laws and
are members in good standing. ; It is be
lieved that others will bo admitted.
The report comes from Los Angeles that
Chanslor & Canfield were offered recently
$4000 an acre for a large tract In the Kern
River district, but would not look with
favor on the proposition. It is also re
ported that another company refused $5000
an acre last Saturday for ajl its posses
sions, a matter of 100 acres. L' ,';
A FEW days ago Grand Marshal Cos
tello wrote a letter to Brigadier Gen
eral R. H. Warfleld, commanding
the Second Brigade of the National
Guard of California, asking that Troop A,
cavalry, be detailed to act as escort to the
grand marshal of the Semi-Centennlal Ad
mission day celebration.
The following reply was received yes
terday from the commander of the Second
Brigade:

POSTER UNVEILED AT CELEBHATTON HEADQUARTERS.
A new complaint was filed yesterday In
the United States District Court against
Ju!i&n Treecnna Biddulph Arnold accus
ing Mm of embezzling Â£6246 Cs Sd of the
estate of Th'omas John Dornville Taylor,
<Leceased.
Arnold Is held a prisoner In thÂ« Ala
iKeda Cour.ty Jail on two orders of extra
dition, one for embezzling Â£9S3 of the
estate of W. H. Swain, deceased, and the
Other for embezzling Â£30u0 of the estate of
George William Buck, deceased. These
a".'<ged embezzlements occurred five
years ago. and the point was raised by
Arnold's attorney on the examination be
fore Dated States Commissioner Heacock
th^t the prosecution was barred by the
ttatute cf limitations of the State of Cali
fornia. Comir.iSMsioner Heacock overruled
the point and held Arnold for extradition
oa both charjres. ginee that ruling, eev
tral prominent lawyers, including united
Stales Attorney Coombs, have expressed
the opinion that Commissioner Heacock's
ruilr.g might be reversed on habeas
corpus, that charges In extradition cases
are to be tried and decided In conformity
vvith tbe laws of the Stute in which the
accused Is found, and that the two
charges against Arnold are barred by the
California statute of limitations. The
opinion was expressed also that Commts
rioner Heacock decided as he did. by way
of excessive caution, knowing that the
prisoner's rights could be saved on habeas
corpus. Arnold's counsel is preparing a
I>e:;tion in habeas corpus which he will
rile to-morrow, and he has every confi
dence that the higher court will reverse
the ruling of Commissioner Heacock and
deny extradition on the two charges
ruimed.
Ar.ticipating this step on the part of
the defense! and the consequences which
might rlow from it, the prosecution de
termined to charge Arnold with an of
it-ns.? alleged to have been committed
Â¦within the last three years, so that no
question could be raised as to the limita
tion of time. A complaint was drawn ac
cord: r.frly by Cormac. Dcnohoe & Baum
in which it was alleged that on Novem
ber 1. IS3S, Arnold, together with Harry
Walter Nix and Charlotte Taylor, was
appointed trustee of the estate of Thomas
John Domville Taylor, who died in Lon
<3or:. England, a t^hort . time prior to
thai <!ate. The estate consisted of Â£C246
f, shillings and 3 p<-nce. or JC1.000. in
>TorthÂ»-nstern Railway consols. Great
Northern Railway, Metropolitan Railway
and Southeastern Railway stocks. This
property was under control of Arnold,
tir.<i the complaint alleges that on the fol
lotrfng dates the following sums of the
â¢ â¢ were embezzled by Arnold: Sep-
I - 1.7. ISC. Â£1000; September 30. 1S97.
Â£2550: October 5. 1^7, Â£K3S Â« s=hilling3
an<l 3 pence, making in all *"1.090.
The complaint was sworn to by Welles

ing Consul General at this port. United

the- warrant of arrest and it was served
upon Arnold in the A!smÂ«j^a Countv Jail

Thomas Grady, charged with an assault

' The vote was taken by roll call. Forty

and forty against it.
â¢ Immediately the call as amended wa3
adopted and the commltttee adjourned.
The champions of clean politics gave a
great shout of triumph when the victory
was won. .
was a demand that the names be read
and published.
When order was â¢ restored Chairman
Bouvier recognized William Metzner.
Mr. Metzner declared that the adoption
of the Goldberg scheme would produce
discord in the Thirty-fifth District. He
said: "I know the temper and spirit of
the Republicans of that district, -and
know that the men who supported Hor
ace Davis will not submit. to be thus de
prived of their rights by the bosses."
â¢When reference to the conspiracy of
the bosses against Horace â¢ Davis was
made some one shouted, "Poodle dog."
M. V. B. Taylor of tho Thirty-fourth
District warned the committee that 2000
Republicans of his district would never
consent to a surrender of their rights.
The faction which the committee propos
ed to recognize did not In his judgment
represent 150 votes.
Another voice â Dibble.
Nathan Frank of the Forty-first made a
fearless and convincing argument. He
called bosses by name. He said that he
knew the temper of the boss faction and
the source of its Inspiration. As he was
reviewing the, events of the campaign one
year ago and the betrayal of Horace Da
vis, some one exclaimed. "The Poodle
Dog." Mr. Frank promptly responded:
"We are in the Poodle Dog now. Kelly
and Crimmins are outside, as they were
at the Poodle Dog in that campaign If
you do not believe the bosses are here
look in the anteroom and you will find
cne who is ready to sacrifice hia party
and create dissension for the sake of one
little office."
Voice â Name him.
"This plan presented by Mr. Goldberg,"
resumed Mr. Frank, "is stuffed full of
platitudes about fairness, but it proposes
to place the power of appointing election
officers. in the hands of bosses and place
hunters. The Republicans of the Forty
first District will not swallow this dose."
George J. Boyne of the Forty-first, ad
dressing Goldberg and John J. Curry,
said: "I am of the same feeling as Mr
Frank. The Republican merchants and
taxpayers of San Francisco will
not swallow your dose. You, Mr
Aschheim, were pledged to stand
for reform and clean politics. You
Mr. Goldberg, knocked - at the door
of the Grand Hotel anti-boss convention
for admittance and solemnly promised to
stand for reform. You, John J Cur
ry, a Democrat â we took you In on the
promise that you would be faithful."
Mr. Boyne was interrupted twenty
times or more, but he finished his speech,
declaring that the Forty-third District
stream of remonstrance followed. The
break was too bad for Goldberg to sup
port. ;: , . - - --' . Â¦ ;.â¢
A. Ruef denounced the plan as unjust,
as it placed the control of affairs in the
hands of a packed committee. It was a
scheme permitting* onÂ© side to hog, all the
Inspectors. He moved to amend by strik
ing out the fifty- four names and inserting
a provision g-ivingr-the County Committee
men of each district- the power to appoint
five election officers. 7 ' " '
: A.' B. Truman denounced * the Goldberg
scheme as a hogging .boss programme. He
directed the minds of the committee to the
fact that ten thousand Republicans of San
Francisco had not .yet registered. They
were waiting to see if the bosses gained
the upper hand in the County Committee.
He scored Kelly and Crimmins by name.
At every opportunity the henchmen of
Herrln, .Kelly, Crimmins v and Dibble
sought to create confusion and force the
vote on the measure.
I. J. Truman Jr. declared that the peo
ple of his district desired fair play. Â« He
knew the Republicans of that district
and knew that they would not permit out
siders to come in and appoint their elec
tion officers.
A motion to commit the plan to a com
mittee of Jive was voted down. The
henchmen of the bosses applauded and
demanded the previous question.
John R. Hillman uttered some words
of warning. He announced that his own
relations with the County Committee
would end if the boss programme was
forced.
A. R. Smith declared that 35 votes re
corded In favor of the motion to refer
the plan to a committee represented an
independent Republican sentiment that
should not be ignored.'
Aurelius F. Buckingham of the Forty
first asserted that the Republicans of his
district knew their rights and knew how
to obtain them. They would not submit
to boss rule.
T H. McCarthy was willing to give all
factions fair recognition. He demanded
that the other side should make conces
sion.
Charles I*. Field demanded In a vigorous
speech that the roll should be called on
the Ruef amendment and that every
member of the committee should go on
record.
, A - R"*f , as5tc rted that thirty-nine
of the nfty-four names in the Goldberg
plan had been voting all evening on one
side. ....
Goldberg shouted: "I deny it, Mr. Ruef
I can prove it. I will read the names."
A scone of confusion followed. There
SOME- OF THE REPUBLICAN COMMITTEEMEN AS THEY APPEARED IN
- FIGHTING ATTITUDEJ
THE forces of Kelly, Crlmmlns, Her
rin. Dibble and Lynch were de
feated In the Republican County
Committee last night by a narrow
margin, the first test vote standing 42 to
40. The battle was won by the deter
mined and aggressive attitude of the anti
boss speakers. A scheme concocted, pre
sumably by Dibble, and brought forward
by Max Goldberg, proposed to place the
control of the primary election boards in
the hands of fifty-four County Committee
men, thirty-nine of whom were henchmen
of the bosses.
The preliminary skirmishing caused the
apprehension that the plan would suc
ceed. The champions of clean politics,
however, fought to the finish, and fought
fearlessly. There was no mincing of
words. Bosses on the outside and crea
tures of bossism In the room were named.
The rollcall was demanded In a manner
that Indicated a determination on the part
of the frier.ds of decency to make every
xnan show his colors. There was a ring
of defiance In the utterances of the anti
boss stalwarts. The tone and language of
their declarations convinced the commit
tee that they would go forth as Independ
ent Republicans and appeal to the enlight
ened and honest Judgment of the people
for support if the boss programme were
forced.
The session being execntlve. thÂ« bosses
could not bring forward the loafers and
rounders of the Mint saloon to cry down
the Epeakers and demoralize the meeting.
The impassioned appeals of the earnest
znen who desire Republican success had
an effect on two of the committeemen
Â¦whose votes had been given to the sup
port of tho boss programme In. the prelim
inary stage of the contest.
The test came on an" amendment pro
posed by A. Ruef to strike from the call
for a primary election the provision nam
ing nity-four men to appoint the inspeo
tors and insert Instead a provision placing
the entire appointment of election officers
In the County Committeemen respectively
of each district. On the call of the roll
the following members voted for the peo
ple as ag.iintt the bosses:
Alfred Bouvier. John J. Daughney, Au
gustus Johnson. John McDermott, John
B. McXamara, John F. MeOlynn, John R.

T'ndcr the amended plan the heelers of
Kelly and Crimmins cannot name the
election officers in the Forty-first or any
other district where a majority of County
Commlueemen stand for decency and re
form.
The call as adopted with this amend
ment provides tiia.t the primary- election
ehall be held on August 24. from 7 a. m.
to 6 p. m., and that the convention, con
sisting of 250 delegates, shall be held on
September 12. There shall be two polling
places in each district and at each polling
place there shall be one inspector, two
judges and two clerks. Precinct registers
of the la-Â«=t election shall be used.
The apportionment of delegates is as
follows: Twenty-eighth Assembly Dis
trict, S; Twenty-ninth. 11; Thirtieth, 11-

The call also provides for the election
of 130 delegates to tbe Republican State
Convention.
The excitement of the session began as
Boon as the chairman stated the order of
business. A. hot skirmish came on the
proposition to confirm Havens as commlt
teeman of the Twenty-ninth District, to
tucceed Paul Schulz, a non-resident. The
confirmation was defeated by a vote of
40 to 3&.
The next order of business was the hold
over plan of I. J. Truman Jr. for the ap
pointment of a committee of nineteen to
provide for a primary election. The plan
Â¦was laid on the table by a vote, of 43
to 24.
On a po'nt of order raised by A. Ruef
the chair ruled that the whole subject
matter be laid on the table. When the
confusion subsided Max Goldberg intro
duced the boss plan. It provided that
each of the four County Committeemen
of a district should appoint two election
officers â one for each polling place in the
Â©istriot â and that the additional officers,
an inspector for each polling place, should
be appointed by fifty-four County Com
xnltteemen.
The rames of these commltteemen were
embraced in the call. It was provided thai
this committee of fifty-four should con
stitute a canvassing hoard with power to
decide contests' and declare results.
Analysis made in open discussion soon
rpvoai^d tho fart that thirty-nine of <iold
berg's fifty-four had bf-en voting the boss
programme nil evening. James F. Keliv

previous question on the scheme, but a

THERE was a rare collection of Dem
ocratic statesmen at \ the California
Hotel yesterday to attend the meet-
Ing of the State Central Committee.
General. Thomas Jefferson Clunie made
his first appearance of the campaign and
was warmly greeted by his fellow Demo
crats. Ex-Lieutenant Governor William T.
Jeter of Santa Cruz, Nicholas Bowden of
San Jose and James G. Maguire, M. P.
Tarpey and Gavin McNab of the home
talent were there. Mr. McNab was the
holder of proxies galore. The balance of
power was in his pocket, but there-was
no occasion for the display of strength.
In fact, the statesmen adopted a plan of
action before they heard tho written pro
tests against such adoption. Ine protests
were given a courteous reading after the
battle was over.' That reading and a be
nevolent smile of Chairman Sims soothed
the remonstrating element.
-"You're a liar, shouted John Heenan
to "Sammy" Braunhart shortly after
the committee convened. Braunhart
sat .". down. For a moment It looked
like a -real Democratic ecrap, but
the troubled blew over and the meeting
ended harmoniously. A communication
from the Bryan and Stevenson clubs of
the Thirty-first and Thirfy-ninth dis
tricts requesting that the State Central
Committee control the primaries had just
been read to the committee by Secretary
Thomas Curran. At its conclusion Braun
hart, leaping to his feet, asked who the
president of that club was.
"John Heenan," replied Curran.
"Then I want to know," said Braun
hart, "if that is theÂ« same Heenan who
marched in the McKlnley parade four
years ago?" , â¢.
The answer, came quick and sharp from
Heenan, and although it was not exactly
relevant, "Sammy" Braunhart was satis
fied.
Yesterday morning's meeting was called
to Issue. a new call for the Democratic
State Convention to be held In San Josa
on Thursday, September 6.
New Call for Convention.
"The so-called Stratton primary law
having been rendered itfvalla by the de
cision- of the Supreme Court," said Chair
man Sims, "it now becomes the duty of
the Democratic State Central Committee
to issue a new- call for the Democratic
State ; Convention. That is tho object of
this meeting 1 ."
After the minutes of the last meeting
had been read Judge Bridgeford of the
legal committee presented a new call and
urged its adoption. , The, call was carried
without a dlssenting'vcice.
| The text of the new call follows:

The Occidental and Oriental Steamship

yesterday. Aboard the steamer were
refuges from Chinaâ people who hurried
home when the clouds of war began to
gather In the Far East. Though none
who, returned were caught .^behind tha
Boxers' firing line, they saw the mobili
zation of troops, witnessed the panic
among the Chinese when they began to
fear for the destruction of their nation,
and knew of the demoralization of trade
In the seaports of Asia Major.
Professor John Fryer, head of the de
partment; of Oriental languages at the
University of California, was among the
passengers on the Gaelic. He tells an

"China winÂ«nut be partitioned. - This is
something that I have always maintained.
Not long ago nearly every writer on China,
foretold its division among the powers,
but they will soon see that recent events
have nullified their predictions.
- "This ,war has aroused a national spirit
in China. It is not that there has -been
any fundamental change in the organiza
tion In the empire since the Japanese war.
That was not really a war at all. A few
raw recruits were stood up before the
Japanese guns and shot down. The great
mass of the, Chinese people did not know
that any. conflict was in progress. ... But
now the news of â¢ the . fighting Is wide

Manhattan Beach last season. The entire
production will be on an elaborate scale,
three hundred performers, athletes, offi

is followed by a grand review of the
troops, comes a thousand-dollar display of
Payn's fireworks, the special features of
which will be changed nightly.
On account of the comparative freedom
from fog in the neighborhood, the Six

been selected for the occasion. The dates

censure Captain Johnson for his handling
of the schooner. Captain Smith of the
South Side life-saving station came to the
mariner's defense. He is an old sailor
and knows the treacherous current that

the owner that Captain Johnson had han
dled the vessel as any other master would
have handled her. He had dropped the
anchors in good time, but the strong cur
rent and later the breakers .had dragged
the vessel inshore in spite of them..
An attempt was to be made to pull the
Neptune off the beach at high tide this
morning. Her owners planned to- anchor
a steam schooner as near Inshore as pos
eible and to try to drag the Neptune from
her bed of sand with cable and capstan.
If that fall, three tugs will be tried at the
task at the next high tide." Sailors who
have seen the vessel's position ' say that
she can never be raised out of the hole

fierce breakers will open seams in the

"A. soldier or tailor In battle," continued
Major Blakeney earnestly, "may be
actuated to perform deeds of valor from
the selfish motives of renown and pro
motion. Your efforts to save human life,
however, were inspired solely by the most
penerous and exalted inpulse. The sworn
testimony of credible eyewitnesses of
your repeated and gallant efforts to reach
the wrecked people demonstrate that you
have Â¦well won the badge of honorable
distinction which the national Govern
ment has awarded to you and which it is
ray pleasurable duty to present. It is
with hearty congratulations that I now
pin this well earned token on your
breast."
Brown, the hero, responded In an almost
inaudible voice. "It is always a pleasure
to know that we have done* our work
faithfullv. and It is doubly so â¢when we
know that our work is appreciated by
others. This token you have presented to

All heroes are made of pretty much the
same ingredients and modesty is one of
them. Brown proved himself to be no ex
ception to the rule. So far from being
elated while eulogy was bestowed upon
him, he looked actually distressed. He
swallowed nervously, drummed a tattoo
unconsciously with one hand on a desk
beside him and beads of perspiration
ttood on his v.eather-bronzed forehead.
Those surrounding him understood the
perils of the eea. They measured and
comprcliended their man and sharp ap
plause spontaneously greeted his modest
response.
"This medal." said Major Blakeney.
"will be tiJiendid testimony for you and
yours, of your valorous eelf-sacriflce and
devotion to humanity under stress of se
verest conditions. He who. at the immi

Brown's eyes brightened a little at this
for "you and yours" Included himself

A meeting of the mlllowners ' was held
'last evening. William Crocker t president
of the San Francisco Pian:ng Millmen's
Association.. presided. ' For two hours the
members^pf Jtiie association listened to re-,
ports and discussed various matters con
nected with the situation. During the
evening telephonic messages were received
from .mlllowners .b Alameda County.
â¢ These were in reference to the situation
I across the bay. The meeting was exec
utive. Fully a score of millowners were
at the meeting. At the close of the session
It was announced that there was nothing
new to be given out. A press committee
had been appointed, but there was noth
ing for the members to tell, except that
the mlllowners would stand firmly by the
resolution they adopted recently.
Individual mlllowners, who were seen
after the meeting, - made the following
statements concerning their position ana
the general conditions. At ilrst, they said,
they were favorable to the original re
quest made by the Millmen's Union* When
th-;y talked with President McCarthy of
t;.e Building Trades Council he made ex
ceptions to the original proposition,
wnlch put a different 'aspect on tnv case.
The miiloqgiera'had all the mills lurnlsh
statements concerning the business thev
were doing. Upon analysis they found
that 48 per cent of tho total was not han
died by the members of tlie Building
Trades Council. This 4S. ; per cent em
braced the work for ships and the work
for exportation to Australia, Honolulu
and elsewhere. The men employed in
shipbuilding are not connected with the
Building Trades Council. On^the 48 per
cent of work the competition . from the
outside . was keen and was aased on nine
hours' work" or more per day. If they
were compelled to grant an eignt-hour day
with the pay now given for nine hours
they would lose the trade. That would
mean that 4S per cent too many mills
..would remain running for the trade re-'
mainir.g. â¢
The statement was also made by mHl
owners. that the pay in San Francisco
averages $3 a day for mill hands and is
much higher than in places competing
with San Francisco. "We are virtually
a unit," was what all the mill-owners as
serted. Tnere Is one small mill it was
said, that is uncertain. This 'employs
four hands. Several mills, so it was also
said by the mill-owners, paid off their
hands last night and dismissed those who
would not agree to resume work to-mor
row on the old lines. ~

In contrast to the short runs through
out the day Lily of the West put up a
go that furnished no little excitement.
She was down on tha card against Uncle
Fuller and ths dogs were slipped to a
strong hare. Uly did not seem to join la
at all and her opponent rolled tip quits a
few points before sho had scored.
It looked like a hard game for Fallon's
many-time stake -winner, more so Â¦when
the general poor condition of the hareÂ»
was considered. The Lily finally started
on the game and took a point or two.
Close to the fence and around the "slip
pers* stand she worked the hard Jack and
kept her opponent from scoring until
when the flag was raised she had twen
ty-three points to her credit. Uncla Ful
ler had but seven points, nearly all of
which were made at the start, when It
looked certain that the Uly was beaten
pointless.
Plough Boy showed considerable speed
and has a chance to reach well down on.
the card.
Short ends were In evidence often^tne
best of which was the win of Bona Flda
from America at 4 to 1.

With Ease.
The San Francisco Flycastlng'Club hold
Its eleventh ' Saturday %* contest at Stow
Lake yesterday. There was a light west
wind blowing^- which made It a fairly good
day for the sport, but the attendance was
not up to the usual standard. .â¢
In the long-distance event Brotherton
made 116 feet. Reed taking second place
with 106 feet and Brooks third with 105
feet. In the accuracy, event Muller got
tho highest score with 95 per cent, Battu
second with 93 8-12 per cent and Young
third with 93 2-12 per cent. In the delicacy
event Young secured first place . with
83 S-12 per cent,* Edwards second with
83 1-12 per cent and Brotherton third with
82 2-12 per cent. .
Following are the scores in full: .
It has often been noticed that there are
no animals which are more dainty and
fastidious In their:- personal habits than
insect3, the extreme pains which the com
mon house. My takes in attending to = its
toilet being a good example of the racial
characteristic. The discovery has now
been made that certain insects have such
a respect for Mrs. Grundy and are en
dowed with such an innate love of neat
ness and order that not even death, or
rather, decapitation, can prevent them
from making one grand flnal toilet, which
Is clearly designed to. give, them a sedate
and respectable appearance after death. ,-. - â¢-
Dr. Bullion, a skillful entomologist, has
discovered this remarkable fact. "During
one of my recent horseback rides," he
says, "1 frequently caught one of those
large flies which annoy cattle and. horses
so much and l promptly got rid of It by
crushing its head. One day, instead of
throwing the mutilated insect away, I
placed it on the back of my hand and In
dolently f watched It. For some seconds
the insect remained motionless, but then,
to my unbounded surprise, it moved fts
front legs forward to the place: where
the heau should have- been and, after- it
had rubbed them nervously' together, ap
parently in anguish, it began to brush Us
body and to smooth. its wings with its
hind legs. Under '- the. gentle pressure of
these limbs the body gradually became
extended and the extremity curved, while
the wings gradually .changed ; their Â¦ nat
ural position and left the upper part of
tho body exposed. . Meanwhile- the -hind
legs : continued to : brush each other- from
time to time. â¢* Naturally I watched this
extraordinary sight '. with Â¦ââ¢ great Interest
and in order to see the finale I took^ the
Insect into my study, where, it lived an
entire day, spending the time at the un
grateful task of making its own funeral
toilet." v

Tournament â Revolver Shots
Likely to Have a Matcn.
Since the election of Captain F. At
tlnger as president of the National
Schuetzenbund the committees are get
ting down to work In earnest, preparing
for the big rifle tournament. Already a
number of valuable prizes are offered for
competition in the several events. Tho
last to come to the front Is the San
Francisco Schuetzen Vt-reln. At a special
meeting, held on Friday evening, thÂ© club
donated $300 cash to be competed for on
the honorary target, twenty-flve rings,
three-shot tickets. During the coming
week a number of the other clubs will
hold meetings and appropriate money to
the funds of the bund. .- :
; On Sunday, September 2 the San Fran
cisco Schuetzen Verein will hold its forty
second annual grand' prize. shooting festi
val on the Shell Mound range. Cash
prizes to the amount of $375 are offered.
Of this sum $151 50 is offered for the best
centers, the twenty prizes running from
$25 to $1 50. A like amount is offered for
the most points on the point target. On
this target $65 Is also offered In premiums
to be divided among ue shooters making
the most flags on thirty-shot tickets.
There are fifteen In all, running from $1)
to fl, ties to be decided on the most blue
flags. The first and last flags in the
forenoon and afternoon will win J2 50 and
$1 prizes.
There Is a movement on hand to bring
about a military or target revolver match
between local and Eastern marksmsn.
Interest in this class of sport has in
creased wonderfully of late and several
propositions have been suggested looking
to a contest between representatives of the
extreme East and West. It Is well j
known that some of the best shots in the
United States can be found in this city,
but they have never had an opportunity
to come into competition with the experts
of any other community. Such compe
tition, however, would have to be shot on
the home range of each contesting team
and the results forwarded by wire. A
number of well-known revolver enthu
siasts have been discussing this subject
lately and have arrived at the conclusion
that a match can be arranged.
Few men care to shoot for glory and
from a reliable source it is learned that
an appropriate trophy will be forthcom
ing as soon as some of the preliminaries
can be arranged. The proposition Is to
have the match handled by an impartial
committee, composed of representatives
of the local revolver shooting clubs, the
National Guard and any other body.
These gentlemen will decide upon tho
general outlines of a suitable contest^ and
Invite all who desire to compete for a
place on the team, which is likely to bo
composed of about ten men. Of course.
If any should happen to fall to come to
the scratch the highest on the reserve list
would step In and take his place. The
next move would he. to challenge any
team of the East, :>o arranging that
localities would be assembled, thus pre
venting the pick of several Eastern com
munities from lining up against San
Francisco. It Is expected that within a
short time a meeting r.t those locally in
terested will be held and . preliminaries
arranged. Such a match would be of
preat interest throughout the United
States and might be the means of get
ting several contests with a number of
Eastern teams. .Â¦".â¢,Â¦

Thomas Â¦ Thomson, - of the Thomson
Bridge Company, is in the city from Los
Angeles. He brings some items of inter
est regarding the construction of the
breakwater at San Pedro. His company'
has the contract for the construction of
the trestle-work, of which there is to be
S500 feet of double track and 1900 feet of
single. Great difficulty Is being experi
enced In driving the piles, on account of
the existence of a'solid sheet of rock un
derlying the bed 'of the ocean and which
it is necessary to drill and blast before
the piles can be driven. Thus far 650 feet
of piling has been driven, over 500 of which
was placed In twenty-one days. This
sounds well, but It took seventeen days
to drive the first twenty piles upon which
the construction platform was placed.
The company has a plant a half mile out
in the sea, from which the trestle Is being
built from each direction.
The California Construction Company
has the original contract, which involves
about three million dollars, and is work
ing the Declez quarry 'with . 300 men and
nine derricks. The rock is conveyed sev
enty miles before being dumped and the
contract calls for the dumping of 10,000
tons in the first month after the begin
ning of real construction and 35,000 tons
for each succeeding month until the com
pletion, of the work. Mr. Thomson does
not say so, but there is every indication
that thes contracting company will fail to
begin the real construction of the break
water> according to the agreement, and
there are severe penalties for such offense.

nons the chance he claims he wants to
Teccv?r the championship and not to do
Sharkcy any wrong by shutting: him out
<if his chance to battle for the title. If by
Tuesday I have received no favorable an
t-wer from Kuzfinurons I rhall discontinue
training and refuse to meet any one until
about June 1. 190L
With Ruhiln, who was the logical can
didate for a championship battle, out of
the way, four men are left who might
want to battle with Jeffriesâ Fitzslmmons,
Sharkey, Corbett and McCoy. All of these
are matched, their money Is posted and
uot one of them would allow the other to
break uis engagement and fight the cham
pion. ~.
Jeffries, In his letter, says that when he
lougrht Fitzsimmons the laiter's managdr
forced him to give Co per cent of the purse,
win or lose, and in order to obtain the
chance he agreed to this. Since then, he
eays, he holds that h-* is emitleo. to a
similar division Â« he agrees to niGCt Fitz
elmmons again.
In the lener he says: "If Kltzslmmons
will meet mo before September 1 I will
i4?ree that the winner taKe all or that the
purse be divided. 50 per cent to the winner
and 25 i>er cent to the loser.
James J. Jeffries, champion pugilist of
The world, to-day Issued an open letter.
In which he says he Is anxious to give
Pltzslniraons and Tom Bharkey each a
chance for the championship before Sep
tember 1 and states that he proposes to
<io It.
Barring a slight bruise over the. left

for the blows of Ruhllu.
Ruhlln's collapse after the fight gave
rise to many ser.satlor.al rumors. One of
these was that Runlln had died aa the re
isiilt ct the injuries sustained in the bat
tle. Although It is true that Ruhiln was
Â¦very 121 for eeveral hours, his life was
"never despaired of.

The Dudes started to push men over the
plate in the second, and when the fifth
Inning was reached had the score tied. No
heart tremors were permitted the fans
until the tenth, when Francks stole four
bases on a drive by him to the fence. The
ball stuck between two boards, despite
Pitt's frantic efforts to remove It. The
score is:-
SACRAMENTO.
Mr. Krancks, the Dude who does the
shortstop turn for Cal Ewlng during the
Saturday and Sunday diamond matinees,
worked a Joker on the Senators yesterday
at Recreation grounds and won the game
for trailing Oakland. For five Innings the
Scoreboard read "five all," and there was
every indication that the match would
be prolong-ed into the eleventh Inning.
Then Mr. Krancks did a stick stunt that
ended a game that was neither good nor
bad.'
The first part of the game was slow.
Even Lou Hardie in the grand stand fell
asleep trying to remember other days, and
there were two men in attendance who
had to be told that a baseball game was
In progress. But after the fifth runs were
not on the card and errors were slighted.
All kinds of new men were seen In the
game. Oakland tried a select pair of
tyrosâ Weed, the third baseman, and Bow
man In left field. Weed made a "rank,
unweeded garden" of his error patch
around the third, sack and Bowman al
lowed four runs in the first Inning by
dropping a fly. With the bags crowded
Borchers struck out Hughes and Hanlon.
Then Stanley sent one heavenward, but
Bowman, could not hold on after the run.
and the sacks were promptly cleared of
Senatorial ornament. When the Inning
was over McLaughlin, Devereaux, Eagan
and Stanley had crossed the rubber and
not a single hit was registered. In the
third Sacramento added another run to
the list.

But their firm parents remained firm.
But their pleading seemed of no avail;
the elder Pasdutouts shook their gray
heads firmly. In negation, though it was
evident that the necessity of refusing
their daughters' request pained them be

Gently, but with de.cision. as one shakes
a hard-shelled crab from out of a scalp
net. the parents disentangled their daugh
ters' arms from their shoulders. Then,
mastering his emotions, their father said:
"No, Anastasia and Cordelia, what you
ask of us is too much!; Never before have
we refused a request of yours. We havo
moved from city to city, from State to
State, to the injury of my business and
the destruction of your mother's health,
in order to deceive people as to your ages.

packing up and going elsewhere, that you
might start anew at 22 and 23 respective

refuse!"
The daughters sobbed like anything. In
fact, they sobbed like everything.
"Papa, I beg of you, do not refuse!"
Cordelia Pasdutout clung wildly about
her fond but obdurate mother's neck and
rained kisses upon her cheeks, while
Anastasia, her sister, did likewise to her

Alameda County built this road for the

Oakland. But after its completion a hitch
occurred in the proceedings and the Con

touched for many months. Now the
viewers' report has been made. It shows
that a road of suitable grade can be con
structed for $1450, giving a thoroughfare
fourteen feet in width and with a maxi
mum grade of only 7 per cent. The road,
as projected, will not cost the county as
much as the estimate calls for. because
much of the work will be donated by
property-owners along the route.
To secure a better mtMicrn of communi

the purpose of a fair start which has
been made across the line to complete a

Interest among trade unionists is cen
tered in the impending battle between the
mill workers and employers for an eight
hour day. The workmen claim that their
movement has received great impetus
throughout the entire Pacific Coast." They
announce that they are prepared to pre
sent a united front and that a walkout
of thousands of men will be the result of,
the refusal of mill operators to recognize
their ultimatum, which is to go into effect
on Monday.
The Oakland union has the backing of
the Federated Trades and the Building
Trades Council of Alameda County. They
declare that they have thoroughly organ
ized â¢ to assist their fellow craftsmen in
this battle for shorter hours of labor.
The reply of the mill owners" has been
to practically ignore the demands of the
operatives. Nearly every . mill owner in
San Francisco, Oakland and the other
nearby cities has slgnea an agreement to
continue the present scale of hours and
wages.
Replying to this stand,- the union men
point out the fact that they have made no
request for increased wages. They assert
that they do not expect serious trouble,
but they do insist upon the cut in hours
of labor. They argue that there Is a gen
eral tendency to readjust time in other
trades to an eight-hour basis.
The I^abor day celebration committees
of the Building Trades Council are much

OAKLAND,, Aug. 11.â The returns
from the primary in Alameda
County are so one-sided that there
is no chance for a dispute. Victor
H. Metcalf has carried everything and
will have a unanimous delegation from
the entire district. Henry P. Dalton car
ried only the voting districts of Hay
wards, upper Fruitvale, Lorin. Thirteenth
avenue In East Oakland and Dwight way
In Berkeley. In every other of the fifty
three precincts of Alameda County Vic
tor II. Metcalf was successful, and In
some cases by very large majorities.
The figures show seme Interesting facts.
The only precinct that Dalton carried In
the Forty-sixth Assembly District was
Haywards. There Dalton was supposed
to be very strong, and yet he carried
Haywards by but 16 majority. In Cen
terville the vote was 128 to 4 against him
and in Pleasanton 181 to 17 against him.
Metcalf carried this district by a vote of
1015 to 42S. â
In the Forty-seventh Assembly District
Dalton only carried Upper Frultvale. and
that bv a vote of 75 for Dalton to 63 for
Metcaff. On the other hand Metcalf car
ried Alameda City by a vote of 986 to 405,
or a majority of 5S1. The vote in this
district was Metcalf 16S2. Dalton 737, a
majority in the district for Metcalf of 915.
The Forty-eighth gave the smallest vote
in the county and Metcalf carried all of
the three voting precincts. The Metcalf
majority was 321.
The Korty-ninth Assembly District, in
which Dalton lived, was carried bv Met
calf by 1020 majority. Dallon lost even his
own precinct, the vote being Metcalf 216
and Dalton 160. On the other hand. Met
calf carried his own home precinct by a
vote of 105 to 47 for Dalton.
The Fiftieth District was supposed to
be a Dalton stronghold, yet Metcalf car
ried it by 262 votes, and he won the Fifty
first District by 572 majority.
Dalton is credited with having spent a
great deal of money In the fight, the sum
being placed at from $15,000 to $25,000. Cer
tainly he did put money into the contest,
but If he did his money. was taken and he
was not supported in return.
This will have a decided effect upon the
political future of Alameda County. It is
the first defeat that Henry P. Dalton has
met with since his entry into politics, and
it means that h!Â» enemies will take every,
advantage of the situation.
The county has been very thoroughly
divided upon this fight. Two factions
have been created, and it Is not believed
that they can be brought together even
two years from now when the guber
natorial campaign will begin.
The rumor that Mr. Dalton would run
as an independent candidate for Congress
was revived to-night, but is not generally
believed. He made the following state
ment:
The Republicans of the Third Con
gressional District have recorded
their choice for Congressman and the
choice has fallen upon Mr. Metcalf.
I, of course, bow to the will of the
majority and congratulate Mr. Met
calf upon his preferment. I have no
particular complaint to make, and
make none. The Republicans of the â¢
district have expressed their wish to
have Mr. Metcalf represent them for
another term In Congress, and they,
of course, know what they want.
Although defeat has come, I feel
that I owe many thanks to my friends
for their kindness shown to me In
this campaign and feel that, under the
circumstances, moro could not have
been accomplished.
HENRY P. DALTON.
Emll Nusbaumer, the manager for Vic
tor H. Metcalf, issued the following state
ment:
It was predicted when Mr. Dalton
became a candidate for the office of
Congressman against Mr. Metcalf that -
Mr. Metcalf would be returned be
cause of his splendid record as a first
termer. This prediction has been vori- '
fled by. the vote of to-day. The desire
of the public to leave the administra
tion of public affairs in the hands of
"William McKlnley,. our present Presi
dent, and tbose, in full, accord with
him, was fully demonstrated. At a
primary to-day throughout the district
a fair and full expression was obtain
ed, and at the coming election I have
no doubt that all factional strife and
bitterness engendered at the primary
will be completely buried, and the Re r
- publican party will, as always, pre
sent an unbroken and harmonious
front. : E. NUSBAUMER.
The vote in detail was as follows:
Forty-sixth i Assembly Districtâ Metcalf,
1015; Dalton. 428; Metcalf's majority, 687.
Forty-seventhâ Metcalf, 1682; Dalton, 767;
Metcalf's majority, S13.
Forty-clshthâ Metcalf. 714; Dalton, â¢ 390;
Metcalfs majority. 224.
Forty-ninthâ Mtitcalf. 1826; Dalton. 806;
Metcaif's majority, 1020.
Fiftiethâ Metcalf. 970; Dalton, 70S; Metcalf's
majority, 262.
Fifty-firstâ Metcalf. 1659; Dalton. 1127;
Metcalf s majority, 572.
There were only two strong fights for
the Assembly in the county, that In the
Forty-eighth district and that in the
Fifty-first- The latter is in doubt.
In the Forty -sixth district It was agreed
that the nomination should go to J. C.
Crooks of ' Haywards. In > the Forty-sev
enth district Joseph R. Knowland of Ala
meda never had any opposition, so strong
was he. and he was a tower of strength
to Congressman Metcalf. In the Forty
eighth district the tight was Â¦ very bitter
and Joseph Kelly, . the present Assembly
man, carried the district as against the
unpledged ticket, by forty-one votes. In
the Forty-ninth district David McW'ade
had no opposition. In the Fiftieth -, dis
trict Bernard Miller made a fight against
J. A. Bliss, the present Assemblyman, but
Bliss carried the district by 352 . votes.
The returns from the Fifty-first district
are uncertain and will have to be can
vassed by the County Committee. One
set of figures gives Frederick C.Clift
ninety -one , majority over Dr. N. K: Fos
ter, while another set gives Dr. Foster
the narrow margin of nine majority.

Amity Rebekah Lodge Is starting in well
with the new term. At the meeting of the
4th inst. the officers initiated half a dozen
candidates and there were several
more candidates for initiation last
night. The lodge will hold an open
meeting on the night of the 18th Inst., on
Rebekahs.
Some time ago a report reached the
membership of Bidwcll Lodge of Biggs,
Butte County, that one of us members
had died in San Francisco and had been
burled in the potter's field. Joseph
Keppel of the lodge was sent to
this city to make an Investiga
tion. He found that the member
had passed away and that his remains
had been placed in Laurel Hill Cemetery
by the general relief committee of San
Francisco. The committee does not allow
a member of the order who may be sick
to suffer for want of attention and if he
dies his body to be neglected and allowed
to be buried in pauper ground.
The* new encampment at Snelling will
be Instituted on the 20th inst. by the
grand patriarch and other grand officers,
and Past Patriarch James Leonard and
members of San Joaquin Encampment of
Merced will do the work.
From reports received 1 it appears that
during the first six months of the cur
rent year the subordinate branch of the
order shows a net gain of 620 with a num
ber of lodges to hear from yet. The pat
riarch branch also shows a good Increase.
At its last held meeting Yerba Buena
Lodge had a double Initiation.
Last Monday night Fidelity Lodge held
its usual "nrst night In tne montn open
meeting." There was,. as on previous oc
casions of this kind, a large number of
members and their friends, who filled the
hall to its limit, a proof of the popular
ity of the socials of this lodge. The com
mittee of arrangements had a fine pro
gramme of entertainment; which was ap
preciated in the extreme by all, they
manifesting their approval by loud and
frequent applause. The programme in
cluded the following numbers: Piano solo,
Mrs. Pracy; a few remarks on Odd Fel
lowship by Grand Master W. \V. Watson;
select reading, K. K. Dorner: specialties,
Henry Neiman; vocal solo. Master Willie
Dodge: specialties, J. P. Gibson of Pre
sidio Loage; xylophone solo, J. Casad:
musical duet, "Master and' Pupil," Mary
Neiman and Lottie Calsing; vocal solo,
Arthur Macphee. This was the first en
tertainment given- under the rule of W,
B. Curtis, the newly installed noble grand.
It was a decided success. After the pro
gramme there was dancing.
What the Odd Fellows do for a sick
brother is illustrated by the following
from a recent issue of the Utah Odd Fel
low: "A lodge In St. Louis recently buried
J. \V. Allen, aged 65 years. He joined the
lodge December 17, 1853, and in 1854 un
fortunately lost his mind. lie was sent
to the insane asylum, where he remained
until his death. The lodge paid his bene
fits during his forty-one years' stay in the
asylum, amounting to $9400. The encamp
ment branch paid benefits amounting to
*eooo."
At the meeting of Sargent Lodge last
Friday night the members and visitors
were delightfully entertained with an il
lustrated lecture on a tour through Eu
rope, delivered by Charles A. Sumner, a
prominent member of the order.
The Odd Fellows.
Last evening quite a large party of the
members of the Kastern Star made a rail
road ascent of Mount Tamalpais.
The grand matron will hold a school of

of all the officers of the local chapters.
There will be two sessionsâ one at 10
o'clock in the forenoon and the other at
half-past 1 in the afternoon, while In the
evening Ivy Chapter will exemplify the
work of initiation.
Yerba Buena Chapter, which was Insti
tuted on the night of the 4th inst., has
decided to meet on the first and third Sat
urday of each month. At the institution
sixty-five were admitted to membership
on transfers . and sixty by initiation.
Eighteen who made application to become
members, being unable to be present at
the institution, will be initiated at a fu
ture meeting. It had been intended to
name the chapter California, but as there
had been one of that name, which went
out of existence many years ago, it was
thought best. not to use the name.
Mission Chapter, at its meeting last
night, had work In the initiatory degree.
In the presence of a large number of the
members % of tho order, including many
past officers. On the evening of the 25th
inst. this chapter will give ! a children's
party" in Its beautiful hall In Mission Ma
sonic building. A most interesting pro
gramme has been arranged for the occa
sion.

man lodge. Previous to the dances there
was a short programme of select numbers,
which was toilowed by the grand march,
when the aprons and ties were distrib
uted. The function was under the direc
tion of the committee on social hour, com
posed of Mrs. Lillie Meredith, Mrs Hock
ing, Mrs. A. Buck. Mrs. Dora Fyle and
Mrs. von Gelsterfeld. The lodge will in

tertainment of its members and friends.
During the social hour after business in
Oriental Rebekah Lodge last Wednesday
ni;ht there was a potato race by the
members. Miss Myrtle Baker and W. O.
Park won the first prize, a cake, and for
the second prize thore was a tie among
three couples. This prize was a box of
candy, and it was left to the Solomonlike
Wisdom of Mrs. Allle Parker, the noble
grand, to determine who should have the
prize*. In order not to create any jeal
ousies among the contestants she divided
the candy among all present. -
Mrs. Klvtra Pope, deputy for district
No. 57. paid a visit to the lodges In her
district, and as is usual each lodge paid
her the amount of her expenses, V. hen
s.he returned to her home she discovered
that e?eh lodge had allowed her more
than she had actually expended, so she
donated that surplus:. $10 In the aggregate,
to the Orphans' Home at Gilroy.
The forty-ninth anniversary of the Insti
tution of the Rebekuhs will snortly be ob
served, and it has been decided to ask
the lodges of this jurisdiction to make
that a donation dayâ that is. that each
lodge In some manner contribute some
thing for the Orphans' Home, which at
this time is in great need of a hospital
ward. A circular letter to that effect win
be sent to each lodge.

programme of dances.
San Francisco Lodge at its last held
meeting received four applications. There
is a movement afoot in this lodge to have
a State Grand Lodge in any State where
ten or more subordinate lodges exist.
A number of members are opposed to a
proposition to increase the lodge dues and
claim to have sufficient to defeat the
proposition. When the matter does come
up it is likely that there will be a spir
ited debate.
San Francisco Lodge has organized "a
pedestrian annex." to be composed only
of Elks. The members start at 10:10
o'clock each Sunday morning from the
lodgeroom and walk to the Cliff. They

ber of Oakland Lodge 171, will be behind

The Druids.'
Last Sunday a preliminary meeting of
past arches of groves in this city and

fraternal relations, of being in closer
touch with each other and cementing the
fraternal friendship that Is one of the
i cardinal principles of Druidism. The
"speaker was elected temporary president
and Grand Secretary John M. Graves
temporary secretary. After some discus
sion it appeared to be the sense of those
present that the association should also
have social features, that a small initi
ation fee should be charged and a small
sum as quarterly dues be levied. The fol
lowing named were appointed a commit
tee to prepare a plan to be presented at
a meeting to be held on the 9th of Sep

vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
Business In the markets here to-day was ftill
meager, but the tone was Improved on contin
ued bear covering, which was stimulated by
the present progress being made by Lord Rob
erts' forces in the Transvaal. Americans were
flrm, making fractional gains.
TIntos were strong and Anacondas made sym
pathetic response.

WASHINGTON. Aug. 11.â To-day's statement
of the Treasury balances in the general fund,
exclusive of the $lc.O,OCfl,000 gold reserve, in the
division of redemption shows: Available cash
balance, $141,355,307; gold, t72.625.300.
Condition of the Treasury.
NEW YOniC, Aug. 11.â The Financier
?ays: The cold exports of the week
liav? net nffecte.i the weeiclyj yhowinr ot
the Now York banks to ar.y extent, but It Is
nevertheless true that the JS.jOO.COO of specie
shij inent, less about |L 401,060 received in opera
tions with th<:- interior. muÂ«t have depleted re
serves cor>sld( raM;-, nr.d th-_ra 1^ reason' for
bellevinp that n?xt week's averase will reveal
a decided fallfnc off In cash holdings. In fact.
If the c-x:-orts of the next few days come un
to estimates, the surrlus reserve of the banks
will po below $:0,0>i.n.H) by a fair marcln.
Against thÂ» losses sustained, the receipts from
the \Ve>t mu.-t. of course, be considered, but as
the crop season is at hand, it is only natural to
look for a Row of money to interior points for
the rerr.aindt V of the month and September.
There is no indication of FJringency in this.
On the contrary, bankers who have all alon,;
predicted higher rau-8 are wonlerinjf if they
wc-iv rot too positive In thÂ»ir assertions. It is
l-laln to be seta, however, that th>Â» factors now
at work In the money market favor a stiffening
in quotations. Call money touched 1 per cent
in .V-w York last week, the lowyst of the yoiir.
The utter stagnation In speculative circle.*
makes demand only nominal nnd th<Â» rise of
$4,K-1S,.?OO In the loans of ih.Â» b.iTiks last week
appeari inconsistent. The explanation le'that
International operations lncident..to British loan
subscriptions are responsible.. The banks when
they subscribe for United States loans o'ten
class the!r allotments as loansâ that Is loans
to the rovrnment â and this may have been
done indirectly now. but by the borrowing of
customers from the banks to pay for their
English bonds. The loan expansion caused
the rise in deposit*, but not to the amount that
other operations called for. The loss in cash
and Increased lepal reserve requirements are
accountable for the contraction of fl.0iS.925 In
excess reserve. Circulation is still expanding
rapidly and will continue to do so perhaps for
60 days yet.

conditions regarded as extremely unfavorable,
but another factor made - itself felt - noon after
the opening, a sudden and radical decline in
corn. A drop of lHc waa recorded In that mar
ket at one time, and the effect of such weak
ness on a market naturally rather, heavy was
Immediate.' Selling. waB quite heavy for some
time, principally by: local traders who had
bought wheat yesterday In the belief that the
Government crop report # would show a big fall
ing off In condition, and-even after this liquida
tion ceased the market showed but little signs
of recovery. The September price was ham
mered down to 75%c before the selling pres
tun was reported. There was noticeable coun
try celling at times and stop orders were re
ctived by some commission houses. The close
was heavy at 75Vic.
Corn was feverish and radically weak. The
Government crop report was a painful sur
prise to longs, who had been led to expect
much more bullish official figures by the com
plaints of damage which have been received
of late, and liquidation was heavy from the
start. September closed lV4c lower at 38c.
Oats were dull for the most part and shewed
weakness. September closed He lower at 21*4c
Provisions were heavy, Influenced by the
grain markets and by the weakness of hogs.
There was very little speculative Interest
shown, moderate liquidation being led by the
packers. Prices ruled lower from the start.
At the close September pork was 12V*c lower,
lord He lower and ribs "V4c lower.

s An immense congregation filled Temple
Emanu-El yesterday morning to listen. to
the maiden sermon of Rabbi Julian Leon
Magnes. The young rabbi is a native son,
the first to enter the Jewish priesthood.
Six years ago he entered the Hebrew sem
inary at Cincinnati," and: remained there
until he took his degree. About a month
ago he was ordained as a rabbi. He will
shortly enter, the rabbinical college at
Berlin, and on his return to this country
will settle at his ministry.':
Rabbi Voorsanger, who watched over the
young minister's theological studies, pre
sented his protege In a few well-chosen
words. Said he: "Never have I felt so
happy or so proud as I do In making way
for this lad, whom I sent away with a
benediction and who now comes back a
rabbi' in Israel." The young: â¢ minister's
sermon, in part, follows: .Â¦â¢ Â¦

it would not be fair to spend $5000 in what
might end in a useless Investigation. It is
argued - that the matter â¢ of. riparian rights
should be settled in' the courts before any
money.- is â¢ spent " by Â¦ this - city, in , investi
gating. Then.* too, the people of Nevada
will not waver, from their opinion that the
natural flow, of the .Truckee River is over
the Sagebrush -State, and "they -.will- re
sist any diversion of .the /water "to Califor
nia 'until compelled , to allow'' it by the
court of last : resort.
- A battle royal will be on between Reed
and Braunhart over the proposition to
bring water to this, city from available
sources. Braunhart ' will insist on the
operations Â¦' of 'Â¦ the . surveying party being;
confined to the Yiiba- River. He contends
that as there are # many conflicting water
rights connected with Lake Tahoe which
would entail- endless- litigation, it would
be a. waste of money. to make the Investi
gation. On the other hand. Reed - holds
that as $30,000 has been appropriated for
the purpose- of . Investigating available
Â¦water supplies, none should 'be exempted
from Â¦ Investigation. ' Â¦Â¦ ,
The proposed expedition for the inspec
tion of the water supplies of the State haa
been postponed by the Board of Public
Works. Acting Mayor Tobin called upon
Chairman Mendell yesterday morning and
iriformed him that a resolution would be
introduced at ; next Monday's session of
the Supervisors containing instructions to
the Board of Works not to spend any
money -in connection with a sifrvey of
Lake Tahoe. The" resolution will be intro
duced* by Braunhart, who is said to be
antagonistic to the Lake Tahoe proposi
tion. While there Is no absolute certainty
that the resolution^ will be: adopted/ still.
Acting Mayor Tobin; deemed | it wise to
postpone .the -investigation until after' Its'
fatehas been sfttled definitely. * â¢

Assistant District Attorney Greany
Begins Proceedings to Collect
Amount of His Fine.
Assistant District Attorney John T.
Greany began proceedings yesterday tc
collect $500 from James Taylor Rogers, the
amount of the fine imposed on the evasive
attorney by Judge Dunne for his refusal
to answer questions before the Grand
Jury relating to his connection with the
conspirators who looted the estate of the
late Joseph Sullivan.
A judgment for the sum named was en
tered in Javor of the city and county and
against Rogers. Execution under this
judgment was issued and an attachment
placed on Rogers' property, which i3 lo
cated on Washington street, near Walnut.
The property is assessed at $5060 and ia
mortgaged - for $2s50. Mr. Greany says
that after the judgment Is satisfied there
will still remain a sufficient balance In
Rogers' name to Insure collection of fur
ther judgments against him In event he
still refuses to answer on the ground that
his answers would lay him liable to pros
ecution fcr felony.

In this manner Chretien opens his tech

Judge Dunne Says No Further Delay
in His Prosecution Will Be ."
Permitted.
John M. Chretien again secured a con
tinuance t>ef ore Judge Dunne yesterday
morning, but the court announced that
he would not entertain further motions
for delay. To-morrow morning, he Bald,
thecase would be called for hearing. -
Two motions on behalf of Chretien to
set aside the indictment were made by At-
Both will be argued to-morrow. ; In the
motions to quash the Indictments the fol

requisite number oÂ£ ballots were not
CHRETIEN IS GRANTED
HIS LAST CONTINUANCE
took it philosophically. He said that he
was tired and the rest from the turmoil
of city life would benefit him.
"I will go into court on Monday," be
continued, "refreshed and ready to prove
that the charges made by Chretien are
as false as he has been proven. Had I
been guilty I would never have returned
to this country. Knowing that I was in
nocent I could not. rest until I came back
to face my tradueer. Why, Chretien's
assertion that I was implicated In the
stealing of the dead man's estate ia a lie
on the face of It.
"I have been in California on and off for
twenty years and have never been ar
rested for crime. I was once indicted for
refereeing a prize fight, but that was
nothing. I have been a politician. 1 but
never did anything that I was ashamed
of.
"The first knowledge I received that my
name had been mixed up in this case was
from a Call representative at Â¦ Nome. It
was on the 29th day of July. The St. Paul
had just arrived bringing supplies, pas
senpers and papers from America. As
Eoon as I read that I had been charged
â¢with wrongdoing, I went immediately to
the office where I was employed and drew
out money enough to purchase transpor
tation back to this city. I left the follow
ing day and immediately upon my arrival
at Seattle I boarded a train and came di
rect to this city. My main purpose in do
ing this was to give myself up to the po
lice. That I have carried out my plan is
evidenced by my presence In this place.
"It Is with, regret that I cannot talk
further about my case. On the advice of
my attorneys I must decline to say any
thing until the proper time. â¢ I Â¦will make
it warm for some people who are trying
to besmirch ray character In an effort to
hide their own guilt. When Captain Sey
mour ordered me taken to prison I asked
him not to do so as I did not .intend ;to
run away. I told him that if I wanted to
escape annoyance from the police I could
have remained in Alaska, where no officer
could have captured- me. What I wanted
Seymour- to do was to send a detective
with me and I guaranteed to pay his ex
penses and ten dollars a day, for the priv
lllge of capturing the man who imperson
ated the brother of Sullivan. â I felt that
If that man was .under .lock and key I
could much "more easily prove my Inno
cence. The request was denied ' me.
"While In Nome. I gave boxing exhibi
tions and conducted entertainments. I
have done fairly well and â¢ expect to re
turn to that country. Mr. Metson, of the
firm of Reddy, Campbell ; & Â¦ Metson, em
ployed me to hold- some rich claims "In
Nome and I did so successfully. Times
are bad in Nome Â¦ and everybody is
anxious- to get away."
fl 6 ft HAVE traveled fourteen days and
fourteen ni&tats to come to this
II city and face the unjust charges
made against me by this fellew
Chretien. My reception to my native city
is not a welcome one, but I suppose I
must bear it until such time as I prove
my innocence of wrongdoing to the court
and to the world." Fred Hansted, or as
he is better known in this city, "Profes
sor Young Dutchy." made the foregoing
statement at the City Prison yesterday,
while waiting for his attorney. Lafe
Pence, to return with bonds for his re
lease.
The prisoner was not discouraged by his
arrest. In fact he expected such treat
ment, having traveled thousands of miles
to face his accusers. His coming was
made known to the police by the press
vesterday and Detectives Harry Reynolds
end T. J*. Bailey were detailed by Captain
Seymour to crops the bay to meet him.
"When the Oregon express stopped at the
Sixteenth-street station the officers
boarded the train and were calmly re
ceived by the man they were looking for.
Hansted expressed his sorrow that he
should be placed under arrest. He had
expected that he would be allowed to go
of his own accord to the office of the
Chief of Police and surrender himself as
an evidence of his innocence. This privi
lege, however, was not allowed him. He
was taken into custody and hurried to the
City Hall. In the City Prison Hansted
pave his age ris 43, and his occupation
that of a clerk. He was arrested on a
bench warrant issued by the Superior
<ourt- on an indictment of the Grand
Jury.
He was placed under $10,000 bonds and
his attorneys. Pence 6c Pence and Grady,
devoted the afternoon in an effort to pro
cure bondfcmen. Jt being Saturday their
efforts were unavailing. Charles J. Pence
visited Judge Dunne at the latter's resi
dence last night and appealed to him to
reduce the bond. Judge Dunne, after
listening to Mr. Pence's statement, said
that he did not want any act of his to
appear doubtful. "Any act that I do," he
eald, "is open to the world. I feel that
a motion or suggestion of this kind should
be received in open court. If a statement
such as you make, Mr. Pence, is made in
open court on Monday it will be my duty
to entertain it and I assure you I will
consider It."
When notified that he would have to re
main in prison until Monday. Hansted

owing to the great demand for this metal
occasioned fcy its adaptability to electrical
uses, which are rapidly multiplying. So
conservative an authority as the New
York Sun figures out that the value of
American copper pent abroad in twelve
months is J5Â»,C:3.3j6. The estimate is
based upon an average valuation of 17
cents per pound, the amount-being 311,255,
040 pounds. The statements of the Sun
Â¦will bear repetition, for California, as a
great producer of copper, is largely inter
ested in the European market.
Notice has been officially given that the
