LONDON, Aug. 14,3:50 a. m. â The British Consul at
Canton, says the Daily Telegraph's correspondent there, has
received the following message, dated August 6, from Sir
Claude Macdonald, British Minister in Peking:
" Our situation here is desperate. In ten days
our food supply will be at an end. Unless we are
relieved a general massacre is probable. The Chi
nese offered to escort us to Tientsin^but, remem
bering Cawnpore, we refused the offer. There are
over 200 European women and children in this lega
tion."
The Shanghai correspondent of the Daily Express, wiring
yesterday, says: The allies at noon Saturday were within
twenty miles of Peking."
As General ChafFee's report, which is the only authentic
news received here regarding the advance, located the interna
tional forces about forty miles from Peking on Friday, it seems
probable that the Shanghai report is optimistic. It is scarcely
likely that the allies could have advanced twenty miles in as
many hours.
A Yangtsun dispatch, dated August 7, giving details re
garding the capture of that place, says:
, "The Russians and French held the left, the British the left
center, tlie Americans the right center and the Japanese 'the
right. The British and Americans advanced on the village at a
rapid rate for five thousand yards, under a severe shell and rifle
fire. The Russians opened fire and the British-American ad
vance became a race for positions, culminating in a brilliant
charge. The heaviest loss of the day was sustained by the
Americans, the Fourteenth Infantry having nine killed, sixty
two wounded and several missing. The Bengal Lancers unsuc
cessfully attempted to cut off the Chinese retreat."
Another Yangtsun special says: "Owing to a mistake the
British and Russian guns shelled the Fourteenth United States
Infantry during the night, wounding ten."
Commenting upon this occurrence the Standard says: "It
is melancholy to learn that the losses of the. Americans, who
seem to have borne themselves with conspicuous gallantry, were
increased by a deplorable error, in consequence of which one of
their regiments was pounded by Russian and British cannon.
The incident emphasizes the necessity of more close co-opera
tion, which is not easily obtainable without a single commander
and a general staff."
Official advices from Yokohama, dated yesterday, sav that
the allies proposed to advance on August 7 to Xantsitsun'g, be
tween Yangtsun and Wusing. The Japanese suffered no casual
ties at Yangtsun, but the official reports say they lost three hun-
The Daily Mail's St. Petersburg correspondent declares
that the taking of Aigun has sealed the fate of the rising in
Northeastern Manchuria. He savs:
"No prisoners were taken by the Russians. Wholesale mas
sacre was the order of the day, and when the battle was over the
Cossacks rode over the field, killing all the wounded with the
butt ends of their muskets."
Yangtsun, and Hsi Wu, zctiich is nearly half way between Tientsin and Peking, was occupied without scri
ous opposition. Hopes arc entertained in Washington that the international forces zvill reach the Chinese
capital without further fighting and that the envoys zvill then be transferred to the protection of the for
eign commanders.
The United States' reply to the imperial edict appointing Li Hung Chang to negotiate zvith the
pozvers, zi'hich 'zvas made public yesterday, makes the entry of a sufficient body of allied forces into
Peking and the relief of the foreign Ministers and residents a condition precedent to all negotiations.
Perhaps the most sf rious report received yesterday zvas that from the British Minister, dated
Peking, August 6. It stated that the besieged foreigners had only ten days' food ami that unless .relief ar
rived soon a general massacre zvas probable. ",. .

CALL BUREAU, WELLINGTON HOTEL, WASH
INGTON, Aug. 13. â It would not astonish diplomats
here should it develop that foreign Embassadors in Lon
don have been exchanging views relative to the course that shall
be pursued by other powers to induce Great Britain to withdraw
from Shanghai. In any such exchanges, however, it is known
that Embassador Choate is not participating, and this Govern
ment officially announced in its reply to the Chinese Viceroys'
appeal that the President use his influence to induce Great Brit
ain to withdraw that it could not .interfere.
Following the example of Great Britain, Germany is ex
pected to land troops at Shanghai as soon as she can spare a de
tachment from the force which she is now collecting in the Far
East.
â¢ "For the powers to permit Yangtse Kiang to pass under
the'control of Great Britain," said a well-informed diplomat this
afternoon, would be to precipitate the dismemberment of
China, which the British Government has been apparently so
anxious to prevent; besides, their interests in that great territory,
which are yearly becoming more valuable, would suffer.
"I do not think I am exaggerating the matter when I say
Shanghai to-day is far more important than the position of the
Ministers in Peking. I hope the British Government, appreciat
ing, the, dangerous complications that will arise from the pres
ence of her troops in that port, will revoke Vice Admiral Sey
mour's orders and return to their station the troops under
instructions to proceed there."

and conditions of our Journey to Tientsin.
At the same time the Tsung 11 Yamen In

indispensable to our Journey that the

of sufficient force to protect 800 Euro

LATEST REPORT OF
THE RUSSIAN MINISTER
we'alrenlngr the Importance of their re
spective commanders In executing strate
gic movements decided on In common.
At Yangtpun the railway crosses the river and branches off to the west.
Now tbe torees have left the railway far in tne rear, and are depending upon
the highway and the river. Hosi Wu la a place of considerable size and the
largest town between Tientsin and Ching Chiwan. The latter place and Tung
chow are the' two cities of considerable size Jn the line of advance after leaving
Hosi Wu. It !s surrounded by orchards and gardens and is not a place likely
to have afforded opportunity for strong defense. It '.s the highest point on the
Pelho. where the river water is depended on. as thÂ« native wells are the source
of supply in the remainder of the route to Peking. As It has taken five days
for Chaffee to report the advance to Hosi Wu. tt is evident that wire com
munication is not open to the front. This was hardly to be expected, and tho
safe arrival of the message at least shows that a certain measure of communi
cation is open. One of the sources of congratulations among officials is that the
fanat!c hordes of China have not materialized or at least have not prevented
' the International column from drawing close to the gates of Peking.. '
Brief as the dispatch Is. it conveys much information beyond that specifical
ly contained in its few words. Although it la not stated what force has arrived,
the War Department accepts It to mean that this is the international force
which rirst took Peltsang and then Yangtsun. -It has gone steadily forward
along the left bank of the Pelho. keeping on the main road which skirts the
river bank.
WASHINGTON. Aug. 13.â The American commander in China In a dispatch
of just three words received at the War Department late this afternoon
sent a thrill of exultation and expectancy throughout official quarters by
announcing his arrival at Hosi Vl'u, only thirty-three miles from Peking,
last Thursday. The last heard from him before this was at Yangtsun.
which had been captured after a hard fight, and word of his movements since
then had been eagerly awaited. Thursday he was eighteen miles beyond Yang
tsung. La'ngfang. the place where the Ill-fated Seymour expedition met disaster
and turned back, had been left behind. The battle of Yangtsung was fought on
the 6th. and the advance to Hosi Wu was accomplished on the 9th. a march
of eighteen miles In three days. This was four days ago. and at the same rate
of progress Chaffee Is even now fairly within striking distance of the walla of
Peking. It was a consummation which the War Department had awaited calm
ly, as It accorded with calculations, although the advance has been more rapid
than was expected.
The dispatch from General Chaff ee. conveying so much in so few words. Is as,
follows: I*'
"CHEFU. Aug. 10. â Adjutant General. Washington: Arrived Hos-Piuw (Hos!
Wu) yesterday. "CHAFFEE."
Word of the advance soon spread throughput official quarters. In the
enthusiasm a report got about that this was the day of the actual arrival at
Peking, but the War Department has not a word of the advance beyond Host
Wu. It was deemed hardly likely that the march to Peking could, have been
made since last Thursday. At the rate of progress, six miles a day from Yang
tsun to Hosi Wu. about twenty-four miles would have been covered In the last
four days, and up to to-day thl3 would still leave the International forces nln*
ml'es from Peking. Viewed from any standpoint, the advance to Hosi Wu was.
of the utmost Importance, not only strategically but showing that communica
tion was open back to Chefu, that the expected opposition from Chinese hordes
had not been sufficient to prevent the steady movement and in the Influence it
would exert upon the Chinese Government.

satisfactory to the generals commanding the relief expedition the United States-will be very glad to enter into ne
gotiations with Li Hung Chang for a cessation of hostilities and an amicable adjustment of all Questions between
China and the powers. This is ln,substance the reply .which the United States has made to the imperial edict ap
pointing Li Hung Chang to. negotiate with.the powers. for peace. A memorandum. conveying this answer was handed
to Minister Wu by Acting Secretary of State Adee yesterday, and was aleo cabled to the powers operating. in the re

powers of July 3. If the Imperial authorities had. any hope of procuring an agreement for a cessation of hostilities and for
the opening of protracted negotiations in advance of complete compliance with, the -conditions of this Government and

out the promises made to the Emperor in" the letter of the President and endeavor to secure an amicable settlement by in
terposing Its good offices with the assent of the other powers. As negotiations progress It will be the policy of the United
States, in the language of Secretary. Hay's note, to seek a situation which may bring-: about permanent safety and
peace to China, preserve the Chinese territory and administrative entity, protect all rights guaranteed to friendly power*
by treaty and International law and safeguard for the world the principle of equal and Impartial trade with all parts of

GENERAL WHEELER

OF BRYAN'S SON
CHICAGO, Aug. ,' 13.â General
Joseph Wheeler, commander of the
Department of the Lakes; to-day
saved the life of William Jennings
Bi'yan Jr., the twelve-year-old son
of the Democratic candidate for the
Presidency. The lad visited General
Wheeler and the latter, after his
first greeting, turned to his work
and allowed the youngster to
amuse himself. Young Bryan found
a loose chair castor and a big bun
dle of rubber bands. These he tied
into a long string and then, secur
ing the castor to one end, went
to a window and began bouncing
the piece of iron up and down on
the sidewalk, seventy-five feet be
low.
The general, engrossed with his
labors, paid no attention to ihe
boy, who gradually became so in
terested in his play that he leaned'
farther and, farther out of the case
ment of the- window. General
Wheeler happened to glance up a
few minutes later and was horrified
to see the lad hanging with his
whole body over the sidewalk and
only the tops of his shoes visible.
Rushing to the window he pulled
the lad in by his legs and landed
him. safely on the floor.

CALL BUREAU. WELLINGTON
HOTEL, WASHINGTON, Aug. 13.â
As nearly aa^figures can express it
the cost to the United States of the
war in the Philippines has been J1SC,
678,000 in cash and at least 2394 lives of
American soldiers. Approximately . the
war with Spain ended and that with the
Filipinos began on February- 1. 1S99. This
date can be used in -calculating expendi
tures in money, although it was not until
February 4 that hostilities with Agui
naldo and his followers really began, and
it was not until February 6 that the
treaty of peace with Spain was ratified.
The total of deaths given is compiled
from a report made by the Secretary of
War in reply to a resolution passed by
the Senate, and froVn General MacAr
thur's death and casualty lists since the
date covered by that report; of May 24,
1900, up to and including August 11. It
is possible that not all the deaths have
been reported, but the possible number of
errors is small and 2334 is approximately
the correct total.
It is dittlcult to approximate the cost
of the war in dollars and cents, for it is
impossible to determine just what propor
tion of the increased- military and naval
expenses of the Government should be
charged to â¢ that war. Estimates pre
pared by expert accountants of the Treas
ury Department show that the cost of the
army and navy since the beginning of
hostilities in the Philippines has been
$164,750,000 in excess of what it would have
been if the same average" rate of expen
ditures had been maintained that pre
vailed before the war with Spain.
On the other hand, at the termination
of the war with Spain, there were on
hand vast quantities of military supplies
of all kinds, which have -been available
for Philippine operations, aaid which can
properly be charged to the Philippine ac
count. ' j.
Subtracting from the apparent Increased
cost of the army and navy $30,000,000 on
account of new construction and other
expenditures in the navy not directlv due
to the Philippines, and 515,000.000 for army
expenses not connected with operations
in the islands, there is left $159,750,000 as
the approximate cost of military and na
val operations in the islands. Â¦ . ' '-.'Â¦
Adding to this $20,000,000. paid to Spain
under the terms of the treaty of peace
and charging to the Philippines interest
on the war loan since June 30, 1899, the
cost of the two Philippine commissions
and various other civile expenditures,
which can only be approximately esti
mated by the Treasury Department, the
total cost of the islands to date foots up
$153,678,000.

nayy expenditures by months from the be
sHTning of the Spanish war, without malt
ing 1 any. deductions for expenditures not
directly due to current operations. Prior
to the present trouble in China this coun
try had in the Philippines an army num
bering G3.5SS officers and enlisted men. In
spite of this force, the Filipinos have been
atle to maintain a species of guerrilla
warfare; which resulted in more casual
ties to the American forces than the
strength of the enemy would seem to war
rant, especially when It is taken into con
sideration that since the early days of
the war there has been scarcely a Hght
that could be dignified by the term "bat
tle." Yet in the incessant skirmishes that
have marked almost every day since thÂ«>
insurrection began the . Americans have
lost 533 men killed in action, and there
have been 1668 deaths from other causes,
most of them from disease, though this
total embracos a few cases of suicide- and
death by drowning and accident. . Â¦ ~v Â¦
Then : have been 2073 -men wounded In
engagements" with Filipinos. Careful
study of the reports of the surgeon gen
eral shows that of the men wounded in
battle, abput nine and one-third per cent
die in consequence of their wounds. This
would add 1E3 to the iist of deaths and
make a total of 2394 from all causes in the
Philippines since the beginning of the in
surrection. Â¦
Most of the deaths, however, can be at
tributed directly to a change of climate
upon the men and the hardships they
have had to undergo in campaigning in a

LOS ANGELF.S, Aug. 13.â Judge Ross In
the United Statii? Circuit Court to-day de
cided the suit of tho Los Angeles. City
"Water Company against the city in favor
of the water company. .
The suit was commenced by the com
pany to have declarer invalid an orciin
anc establishing the water rates passed
by the Council last February. The deci
sion says that the only way the city'can
be free to cut the rates. is by paying or
tendering to the company the value of the
improvements on the plant, as well as the
amount askod for the same. The decision
touching this point Bays:
Tho defendant city has.it lit Its power to
put an m<\ to all of the rights and obllra-
Uods arising under, the contract, by paying
or tenderin- to the complainant company tho
value of the Improvements made In. about and
upon the water works, as therein provided for.
It can do this at any. moment that It is ready
to make the payment, after the amount has
been agT<"*<l .upon or has been otherwise deter
mined. Until It does so, or offers to do so.
all of the covenants and provisions of the
contract continue, including â¢ that , prohibltlnK

INDIAN PREFERS
I DEATH TO DISGRACE
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO, Aug. 13.â Fred and Frankie
Hlmes and Elmer Martin, the boy poison
ers, will probably appear in the Superior
Court to-morrqw for arraignment on the
information filed by Assistant District
Attorney Edwards charging: them with
murder. Attorney M. Iv. Harris, who
will defend the boys, has not yet made
public his plans, but says he Is satisfied
the youngsters will* be acauitted.
The plea for Frankie Hlmes and Elmer
Martin will undoubtedly be that they diu
not actively participate in UW commission
of the crime and that they cannot, on
account of their extreme youth, be held
responsible for failure to reveal the plot
before it had been carried Into execution.
Elmer Martin's parents declare that their
son acted as any boy of his age would
have done. On tne morning following*the
commission' of the crime he went to his
home in the country and informed his
older brother of the plot to poison Hlmes.
saying two doses of the sturf had already
been administered and telling of Himes"
sickness. Attorney Harris says tho boy
would have revealed the plot sooner had
he had the opportunity. â¢ .
Regarding Frankie Hlmes. who is only
9 years old, the defense will try to show
that he did not realize the wrongfulness
of the act his brother was about to com
mit and had been intimidated into se
crecr by Fred.
So far as the leader of the plot is con
cerned the only question will be whether
or not he was old enough to realize tha
enormity of his crime. Tho District At
torney declares that the boy's own con
duct "before and after the deed shows
that he fully realized what its awful con
sequences would be. The public prose
cutor says the boy carefully laid secret
plans' preceding the poisoning and . the
skillful suppression of material details in
his subsequent confession shows, matur
ity of Intellect sufficient to prove him re
sponsible in the eyes of the. law, notwith
standing he has not yet attained the age
of discretion by the cods. The trial will
probably take place about the. middle of
September.
Fred is visited at the jail nearly every
day by his relatives. Among thosa who
call on him most frequently are Mr. and
Mrs. Martin, the parents of Elmer Mar
tin. .They Have;, taken 'a. deep Interest in
the lad ever since his arrest and furnish
him with food and clothing. Mrs. Mar
tin, who is a sister of the prisoner's dead
mother, says Fred Is a good boy and that

Mason of Illinois arrived here from Alaska

weeks will begin campaigning In Illinois.
Senator Mason said In an interview:
There has been a great deal cf talk regard-

have had oar differences regarding tha man
agrÂ«neat of certain measures of government.
but to me there is no dearer friend on earth
than William McKinley. As a man he is af
fectionate and lovable for his true worth. If
I was in financial trouble to-nleht there Is no
man I wouU rather appeal to than President
McKlnley. Our difference* in political meas
ures will not interfere with my going to worlc
for him, and I want to a 3d that we are goirs?
to carry Illinois for McKinley and Roosevelt.
We are going to make a good job of deadest
u? that lS-to-1 craze.
I have never talked with an American citi
zen who did not say we did not want one inch
of ground that does not belong to us. but they
do say we want every inch we ooueht from
Russia and -we intend to have it. Personally
I am In favor of taitins all we bought and
paid for. and falling in getting It, to take It
all. This may sound strange, but 1 mean It.
Th? claim made by Canada and Great Britain,

TABLEAU!
No time wac lost In alleviating the dis
tress of the Jiiilmals. Men whose names
are known throughout California were
soon staggering under loads of hay and
grain and watÂ»r, while ladies better fitted
to preside at ballroom functions raided
the rancher's milkhouse and set forth
pans of bread and milk for the dogs,
cats and chickens. Jf animals remem

Strong ranch will always treasure up the
memory of one gala day.
The hunger of the dumb brutes havintr
been appeased some one suggested that
the cows ought to be milked and the
party fell to with a will. Charming were
the milkmaids In their summer finery.
The men folk In all the glory of outins

$80 in coin. The ladies of the party took
charge of the kitchen and larder, while
the gentlemen invaded orchard and hen
house. An hour later all sat down to a
typical mountain repast. Xight had
fallen when the caravan returned to the
hotel, followed by the grateful baying
of the hounds and the mellow low of the
kine.
And so was saved the livestock on
Farmer Armstrong's ranch.

to the bastile, sat the guests from the
City' by the Golden Gate, enjoying a
siesta. There was the incense of fra
grant tobacco about the men, and there
was a scent of delicate perfume, for there
were ladies in the merry company. Some
one, gossiping idly, related the story of
Farmer Armstrong's seizure. Xow, the
rancher had been kind to the city folk,
and there was an outburst of indignation,
then an animateu discussion.
"I have a joily Idea." suddenly cried a
charming girl in dainty summer costume â
a city society belle.
"Tell u? about it," drawled a gay
youth, attired in Immaculate duck.,
"Let us go up and feed the cows and
horses and chickens on Mountain Ranch,
and care for the house till the farmer
comes back. It'll be such fun," replied
the charming girl. There was a chorus of
assent, and away fluttered the women to
get their hats and sunshades.
CHAPTER IV.
TO THE RESCUE
The sun was still high in the heavens

last week near here on a charge
of grand larceny brought by his
son-in-law, Charles E. Truitt.
Truitt eloped with Armstrong's daughter
several years ago. and a feud has existed
between the men since then, one result of
which is Armstrong's arrest. The officer
who arrested the farmer was inexorable
in his capacity as a minion of the law,
and when he found Armstrong he prompt
ly took him to Healdsburg jail, deaf to the
latter's pleadings to be allowed to care
for his stock or lock up his home. So the
cattle and the horses, the hens and the
geese, the dogs and all dumb creatures
on the place, were left to starve, and the
house was left at the mercy of any va

flN IDYL OF SONOMA HILLS.
The chase of Murderer J. E. King is one of the most remarkable of
man hunts. For thres weeks numerous posses have been on the trail of
the fugitive and they tracked him from Two Rocks Vallsy, over in
Marin County, to the Oregon line, the trail leading through the roughest
of mountainous country. One by one the posses, vrorn out by hardships,
have abandoned the chase. But one man has clung to the trail â SneriiT
Taylor cf Marin County. Tireless and determined he has out-traveled
all his posses, and while others have fallen back discouraged he has al
ways led the van. The Sheriff has gone to Yreka and will strika
across the country to head off his quarry, who is reported to be nearir.g
the Oregon line.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ© Call
I Thursday in pursuit of J. E. King, tha
REDDIXG. Aug." 13.â Sheriff Taylor
of Marin County continues his
untiring pursuit of murderer J.
E. King. About a week ago the
Sheriff passed through this city
en route to Trinity County in his
efforts to head off the fugitive, who was
reported to have entered the southern
part of Trinity County from Mendocino
County. He visited almost every section
of Trinity County during the past week,
but without apparent results.
Last evening the sheriff came down
from Weaverville and without entering
this citv took the northbound train at
Middle Creek, a small station three miles
north of here. He went to Yreka and
from there will start for the Salmon River
country, in the western part of Siskiyou
County. The murderer's companion and
guide, an Indian named Carter, is thor
oughly familiar with the entire Salmon
River section and it is believed that they
will pass through that country in their
journey, the objective point of which 1*
supposed to be Southern Oregon. Sheriff
Taylor believes that he is on the right
trail, notwithstanding that the posses are
still scouring the hills and valleys of
Mendocino County. If he is on the right
track he must be giving the fugitives a
close chase, as he has been untiring in
his pursuit, and they must have been
constantly on the move to escape him.
The country into which the Sheriff is
about to continue the pursuit is very rug
ged and sparsely settled. Travel on any
but the beaten trails is almost impossible
and the presence of strangers is quickly
noticed by the miners and stockmen.
These points should prove of assistance to
the pursuer if the fugitives are traveling
northward. '-'Â¦.
ZACARINI GIVES UP.
One of the Man Hunters Says King
Is Too Far Ahead.
Sp-cial Dispatch to The Call.
COVELO. Aug. 13.â One of Sheriff Tay
lor's tracking party that left here last
slayer of S. H. Church, returned this af
ternoon, having abandoned the chase for
the present, and will await developments.
Gus Zacarini, the leader of the return
ing posse, furnishes strong evidence in,
support of the fact that King pa33Â»-l

| mountaineers In Mendocino and Trirrity
i counties. Zacarini had a photograph of
King and it was r-adily identified by
; many ranchers in the hills as that of a
man who had calted there for food six
days previous. Zacarini states that ho
> could not get any traco of the half-breed
Indian and that all those who had seen,
King declared he was alone and traveling
afoot. He had nothing but a six-shooter
in the way of arms. King in some in
stances would feign semi-foolish antics
in asking- for food and in one case as
sumed the role of a deaf and dumb mute.
making his wants known by signs.
Zacarini's reason for returning from
the trail seems justifiable. Ho declares
he was over five days behind King at
every point and could not hope to regain
any time, as Kins was making faster
time afoot than the posse. It is believed
that the half-breed Indian has both
horses, and when the fugitives touched
the Hoopa Valley Indian reservation the
half-breed drifted in and mingled with
the bands of Indians and half-breeds
thereabouts. The route taken by Kins
leads directly into Oregon and the mur
derer has taken care not to follow a sin
gle highway or telegraph or telephone
route, and if Sheriff Taylor does not In

TAYLOR'S ACTIVE HUNT
FOR MURDERER KING
A taie of mystery comes from the wildernsss that lies to the
north cf Pike River, in British North American dominions, an inves
tig:at:on cf which may reveal a tale of massacre by Indians unparal-'
leled xn Alsskan lore. A party of surveyors recently found in the path
less forests a deserted logging camp, well equipped and well provi
sioned, and a sawmill ready for operations. There was not a living soul
in the camp. Scattered about were the skeletons of many horses, with
the packs intact. The belief is that a party of Indians descended upon
the camp, killed all the men and carried away ths bodies.
Epec'.al Dispatch to The Cat!
VANCOUVER. B. C. Aug. 13-
Frederick Clem, who arrived from
Atlin to-day, brings news of what
eppears to be another wholesale
murder committed by the Indiafts
of the northern wilds.
The telegraph survey party under J. B.
Charleson recently came upon a most
Ehastly find. They discovered a large.,
â¢well-provisioned camp, with the best ar
ranged equipment, but deserted. It had
been left apparently without a moment's
notice, as everything was in Its place.
The theory If that the owners of the carr.p
*rere murdered by Indians and t.ieir
bodies taken away. The find was made
about forty miles off an old trail whicil
the Indians had been using for years.
The trail poes up Pike River to an old
Indian mission, then down the Taku River
to the inlet leading to Juneau. That was
the road by which the former occupant 1 ?
of the camp must have come.
Twelve dead horses were almost
stumbled over by the men chopping out
the line. These horsc-s or what had been
the horses, were fully packed, they being
mere skeletons a.nd the packs being intact.
Searching further the men found a saw
mill in an almost perfect state of preser
vation. The machinery and boiler were
comparatively r.â¢ and the turn-wheels
arid belting- locked as if they could be set
In motion at a touch of the engineer's
hard. Around the sawmill a number of
Cabins were placed, which, upon beins
searched, were found to be well stocked
with groceries. There was all the usu;tl
run of logging: provisions, besides a good
supply of overalls, axes, saw files, grind
stones, etc.. and even the glass in most
of the windows was intact. From the fact
thai the horses were practically skeleton."
it is surmised that the animals must have
been dead between two and three years.
The Indians have for years been using
the trail route above indicated, proing
down to Juneau in four or fivt dayj.
Thfre :s* no absolute certainty, but ap
pearances indicate that the men who
formed the abandoned settlement must
have b"tn murderci. ' They may. how
ever, havo lost the trail and concluding
it was useless to start out with the
horses, left the Jatter to their fate. There
were slight evidences of blazing and
n~.arkir.g- on the trees, so that they may
have intended to come back, but the blaz
ing gots in different directions and the
mt-n may have taken different courses
when they decided to desert the camp.
ThÂ» camp was in a marshy bottom,
though in winter time, when the ground
was frozen, horses and other animals
could walk on it. If they were there in
the spring the marsh mieht have become
so boggy as to prevent horses from mov
ing, but the leaving of ail the provisions,
just as if the owners had been spirited
away without a moment's warning. 13
the mystery that so far none have been
able to solve. There is no clew as to
who the unfortunate people were.

of the Etreet-railway strikers have their
headquarters, was arrested at noon to
day and this afternoon was "sweated" by
Chief of Detectives Desmond in order to
learn the details of Saturday night's dy

theory of the police that the dynamite
plots were hatched in Whalen's hall and
that Whclen had knowledge of them.
General Manager Baumhoff of the St.
Louis Transit Company said to-day: I
am sorry that the newspapers learned of
the arrest of these men yesterday. "We
had been watching them for some time,
and if nothing had been published we
would likely have bagged about ten more
of them in" a short time."
Assistant Prosecuting Attorney John

under the statute prohibiting the placing

1SS7 and is now hiding in New York to
escape death at the hands of anarchists.
He says, in substance, that he was
drawn into the Paterson anarchist society
and when he found out its objects did not
dare leave the society for fear of his
life: that on May 1 this year lots were
drawn to decide who the assassin should
be. The first fell to Gaetano Bressi to
kill the King of Italy; the second fell to
one Arturo Clovanelli. whose victim was
to be President McKinley; three others,
Â¦whose names the informer declines to
give, were to murder the Emperor of
Germany, the Emperor of Austria and
President Loubet of France. He declares,
however, that the Federal authorities
have already received all this information
from him.
He furthermore asserts that Consul
General Branchl was notified on May 16
that it had been decided that King Hum

to-day under most auspicious and fas

of the great caravansary are snugly
housed the Â¦ elite and fashion of Burlln
game, San Francisco and Oakland.
Reveille sounded at 10 o'clock this fore
noon, when the sharp clicking of the grolf
sticks and the hurrying about of the
gaudily attired caddies signaled the open
ing of the sport. There are whispers of a
bit of "jockeying" In the tournament on
the links, but a3 the handicap will be de
termined by to-day's play a little head
work may be excused. More exhilarating
perhaps, the polo game attracted a large
attendance to the cozy racecourse, almost
within stone's throw of the hotel, this
afternoon. Lowering clouds that seemed
a foreboding of rain and a chilling blast
from the sea compelled the fair buds of
society seated on the tally-hos to keep
well muffled up in furs, and the cllrrmte
was pronounced just execrable. The
grand stand was well filled with guests
from the hotel, while a liberal sprinkling
of villagers from "Old Town" enjoyed the
game as well. All descriptions of vehicles,
from the buckboard to the automobile,
lined upon the infleld.

Church. Organization a Subject Which
Brought Out Strong Senti

"Is there overorganizatioh In the
church?" was a question presented for
discussion at the weekly meeting of the
Presbyterian ministers yesterday morn-
Ing. Rev. Herbert N. Eevier and Rev. E.
G. Mathena discussed it. It was not a
debate, but both clergymen had strong
opinions on the subject and expounded
their views with fervor.
Dr. Bevler thought the Presbyterian
system the best In the world, but he
thought there was no organization In the
efforts made In behalf of the young peo
ple of the church. He stated that the
Boys* Brigade, which was organized
some time ago, was in excellent condi-
Dr. Mathena felt that although th#i
Presbyterian organization was good they
were weak in not having a Bishop or a
concentrated power that would regulate
the relations between the pastor and the
church and the church and the pastor.
Rev. R. W. Reynolds also addressed tho
ministers on the subject. He said' there
was too much church organization and
too little home influence.
Rev. Dr. Mackenzie, "pastor of the First
Presbyterian Church, said he objected to
the concentrated power of a Bishop to
regulate his church. He contended that
if any one came to his church to dictate
he would be conducted out. He â¢ was
strongly opposed to episcopal power.
Rev. T. H. Woodward addressed tho
Methodist ministers. Ha reviewed a book
recently published by Rev. "W. S. Urmy

Rev. George Hatch occupied the atten

her whereabouts so that she can be called

The matter was reported to Colonel

theory offered for the shooting Is that the
recruits at the Presidio have been in the
habit of making the neighborhood their
stamping grounds and have often made
night hideous with their yells.
The condition of General E. B. Willis

to move to the front caused great glee.
Their horses will be held at the Presidio

"It is not a defense that the title under
which the plaintiff claims comes from a
railroad patent which contains a provision
excluding and excepting all mineral lands,
and that subsequent to the patent the de
fendants discovered valuable mineral
lodes on the lots patented, and had located
and are holding them under the mineral
laws of the United States. It does not fol
low that because the grant of the landa
quarter of the routhwest quarter of the
south half of the southwest quarter of
section 27, township XJ north, range 6 west.
In rendering his decision Judge Belling
er said:
was not mineral and the patent excepts
mineral landa that there never can oe a
perfect title to the lota patented; Xftat tho
owner and his grantees must always hold
subject to discoveries of minerals that
will defeat the title. The patent, in thÂ»
absence of fraud, is an authoritative de
termination that the lots described are
within the grant. It devolves upon tho
land department to decide the question,
and It does this when it Issues the patent,
and the case is not altered by the reserva
tion mude In the patent."
Judgement was given for tho plaintiff

Â«7tp SPECIAL meeting of thÂ£ executive
J[\ committee of the California Min
li 1\ ers' Association was held last even
ing at the Union League Club, the
objects of the meeting being briefly set
forth by the president, W. C. Ralston.
Attorney C. \V. Cross in a communica
tion to the association reviewed the his
tory of the litigation in which the Red
Dog Mining Company was the defendant.
It Is stated in the communication that
Spaulding and Engelbright, representing
the defendant company, never obtained a
permit in proper form from the Debris
Commission to pursue the work of hy
draulic mining. -While efforts were being
made to obtain permission which would
hold good in the courts a storm came
and filled the lmpoundng dam with debris.
After the dam was raised another storm
came 'and filled up the basin, bo there
was no impounding capacity on which the
commission could grant a permit. The
case went to trial and Judge Davis of
Yuba and Sutter decided against the com-
I-nny. Mr. Cross does not encourage ap
l>eai to the Supreme Courc in this case,
Â¦ihe inference, is conveyed that there
should be a stronger case to test the
force of the Caminetti act.
Measures have been taken in the Su
perior Court of Sutter County to enjoin
William Nichols, of the Polar Star Min
ing Company. Dutch Flat. Placer Counfy.
from mining by the hydraulic process.
The story is told to the Miners' Associa
tion that Mr. Nichols obtained license
in proper lorm. and on the strength of
that license expended $6500 on the im
pounding dam. It ia probable that the
litigation in this case will be taken to
the Supreme Court to test the virtue of
the Caminetti act.
The association felt that tbe points In
volved In the' suit against Nichols were
of sufficient Importance to the miners of
this State to warrant the association act
ing with him in his defense. Nichols in
sisted, however, that in the event of such
aid his attornev should have charge at
the case. Tho point was raised that the
association had taken the Red Dog case
without thoroughly investigating its
merits and after wasting time and money
in the proceedings had found itself with
out legal standing. In this case, before
uniting v.ith Nichols, it was determined
that the association should satisfy itself
that Nichols* permit.- was proper and

TO H YDR AULICKERS
In anticipation of a strike by the mill
workers If their demands for an - eight
hour day were not allowed, tho owners
on Saturday evening when the men were
paid off told their employes that their
services were no longer required. The op
eratives were ordered to remove their
tools. A few of the union men applied for
work this morninp. stating their willing
ness to abide by the old nine-hour sched
uie. but their services were refused. The
present situation practically amounts
to a lockout, as the mill owners declare
their intention of denying work to their
old employes until they withdraw their
demands for a shorter day. The men are
to be allowed a few days of grace In
which to consider the matter, and if they
show no tendency to back down the Mil!

MILL OPERATIVES IN /
OAKLAND LOCKED OUT
BY THEIB EMPLOYERS
The. millmen have received a notice from
Secretary \V. M. Page of the Building
Trades <"ouncil that the Amalgamated
Sheet Metal Workers expect to be placed
on the elght-hour-a-day schedule begin
ning Monday, October 1.
Oi the 1010 mill hands employed in the thirty
one mills in San Francisco, Alameda and
Santa Clara counties C5o men have walked out
and 255 are still at work. This does not in
clude the California Door Company, which
employs 200 men, who have not struck.
Will pay further, after urir\g our best efforts
to confer with a eommitt-e from the Millmen's
I'ni^n In regard to adjusting the differences,
they referred us to the Building Trades Coun
cil, and eventually, not knowing the-condltions
between employer and employe, our commit
tee was unable to come to any adjustment of
matters concerning the mlllworkers..
It has.t-een stated and is a fact that most of
the various branches in hull. line construction
here work eight hours per day. The conditions
however, are different as between us and
other branches, inasmuch as they have but
local competition, while we have competition
from the various localities, as before men
tinned.
To reduce our working day by one hour
means, when the fixed expenses of running a
mill are considered, at leact 20 per cent, which
is more than enough to cut out all of our ror
elrn bu^ineÂ«s.
To ascertain the proportion of our product
hami!e<! by th* members of the unions be
longing to the BuildlnK Trades Council we have
taken as a basis all the business done by our
bay county mills these last six
norths and find the figures to be
12 per cent, leaving: 48 per cent shipped
foreign, to Honolulu, the Interior, the East and
material connected with ship-building. For
much cf thiF we compete with the Xorth. the
Ka?t and Middle West, where the mills are
â¢rorktax ten or more hours and paying their
tii^r. all of 20 per cent less than the wages now
belnâ¢ r^ld h<rre.
Recognizing the far-reachlntr effects on the
Industries of our city and State, we have
reached this conclusion after a very careful
consideration of the Fltuatlon.
Th* time seems to have arrived when the
plalninp-mlll owners of the bay counties should
plve to the general public their reasons for
the xtar.d taken in refusing to concede the de
mands of the Millmen's Union for an elght
hrvur day.
Fifthâ One aDDrentlce allowed to every man.
A joint meeting of the San Francisco.
Oakland and San Mateo Planing Mill asso
ciations was held in the rooms of the
Builders' Exchange, on Now Montgomery
street, last evening. The session lasted
until nearly midnight. The following
statement was given out for publication:
Uillmen State Their Position.
Fourthâ Three dollars per day shall be the
minimum rale of wages for eight hours; men
sent out of the city to work to receive all
necessary hotel and traveling expenses in ad
dition thereto.
Thirdâ No apprentice permitted on any out-
Ride Job, unless accompanied by a Journey
man.
First â On and after AugU't 12 eight hours
shall constitute a day's work on all work per
formed In shops, factories or buildings.
Secondâ Time and a half for Sundays, for all
overtime, and all legal holidays.
Following is the text of the agreement
between the varnishers and polishers and
the mill-owners, which was accepted by
the latter yesterday:
"Over six months ago the mill-owners
were Informed that on August 13 the
eight -hour day would be requested, and at
the time they were asked to express them
selves upon the issue. They almost unan
imously stated that it would be satisfac
tory provided the rule became general.
Upon the receipt of these statements the
request was m.ide. giving the employers
sufficient time to protect themselves in
bidding on new work and allowing any
existing contracts at the time of the no
tice to be completed under the nine-hour
schedule. Nothing could have been fairer
or more just. The employes have kept
their word an-1 Intend to adhere strictly
to the principles involved in the Issue."
President McCarthy of the Building
Trades Council takes exceptions to the
statements made by Mr. Wilkie to the ef
fect that the millmen have been deceived.
Mr. McCarthy said last evening:
"The millmen are not and have not been
deceived. They have given this question
long and serious consideration and feel
that they are entitled to the same work
day that prevails in every labor center in
the country. 1
Says Ken Were Not Deceived.
"Some of our men are experienced me
chanics and have been in our employ for
years. 1 didn't have the heart to tell
some of these old fellows to take their
tools with them when thev went away
Saturday. The strikers do not understand
our position. Fully 4} per cent of our
work comes in comoetition with firms
outside this section and not controlled by
the Biiildins Trades Council. It is the
competition with this work that forces
us to insist on nine hours' work for the
present wage scale."
tire season like the millmen on account
of the rainy season.
Andrew Wilkie. chairman of the press
committee for the millowners, said last
evening that the situation was unchanged
from the mornlne. Mr. Wilkie has his
duubt.s about the men holding out. He
thinks everything will be settled ajni
cably inside of a week, but does not Inti
mate thai the owners will be the peace
makers.
"The mill-workers," he said, "have been
der-eived and when they rind it out
they will come back to a man. They
were assured by the promoters of
this strike that there would be at
least four mills at work on an eight-hour
basis to-day and that ihe rest would fall
in line within a day or two. As a matter
of tact but cne mill is working eight
hours and that is ~ the Searie-Hayman
plant, which has never been a party to
BETWEEN* 300 and 400 operatives In t
the lumber and planing mills of
this city and Oakland are idle. The
machinery in all of the smaller
rr.nis en both sides of the bay was at a
FtarsdFtill yesterday, and the present out- j
jook is not encouraging for an Immediate '
resumption of work. There are forty-six
mills affected by the strike or lockout, :
twenty-seven of which are in San Fran- !
Cisco. Both the millowners and the em- '
j'loyes are dctcjjmJned in the positions
they have taker.. The proprietors main
tain that the present nine-hour-a-day
Fchefiule Is in every way reasonable and
is.iT, while the mill operatives insist that
they are entitled to the same considera
tion as the other twenty-seven branches
of labor affiliated with the Building
Trades Council, all of which enjoy the
benefit of the eight-hour rute.
The trouble between the millowners and
their employes has been brewing: for some
time and yesterday's trouble was antici
pated.. More than five months ago the
Building Trades Council decided that tbe
millmen were deserving of the same coa-
Fificration as the workmen in other
tranches of trade In so far as working
hours were concerned. A notice was Sent
to the millowners that on and after Aug
ust 13 they would be expected to recognize
the eiRht-hour rule. Several meetings of
the representatives from all the mills were
held and an attempt was made by the
BuildingTradcs Council >o induce the mill
owr.fr? to aproe to these terms, but with
out success. I>ast week the following no
tice was posted in tht mill and yard of
every company:
Resolved. That en and after thÂ» 13th of Au
rru^t I9M and rutll further notice, the un
deralsaed. we ar.d each of uÂ», will continue to
run our establishments en the tame time as at
preffnt or heretofore.
Appended to the resolution are the
r.ames of forty-six fira? that have agreed
to stand by each other and fight the mat
ter to the end.
IMillowners Not Surprised.
The men gave no notice of quitting when
they left their work Saturday afternoon.
The mUlowners. however, were not sur
prised when their employes failed to put
in an appearance at T:3'J o'clock yesterday
Biorning. They had anticipated a strike
aitfi were prepared. Some of the smaller
shop? did not attempt to run at all dur
ing the clay, while ihe larger ones were
run on half time, having from two to five
non-ur.jon men at work.
At 8 o'clock many of the help reported
for d'Jty, but were promptly refused
admittance. The owners grave orders to
clÂ»>se and lock the gates and to admit no
ore unless he agreed to work under the
old nine-hnur-a-day rule. Detachments of
police were on hand in many of the mill
yards, but the men were orderly and dis
persed soon after being refused admission.
Some cf the millmen were paid off, while
other? were told to come back on the reg
ular pay day and get their mopey. The
millowners are not disposed to put on
- marry extra non-union men. as they be
lieve their old employes will return soon.
and the purpose is to hold their positions
t-fien as long as possible.
Only one case of disorder was reported
during the day and that was a trivial mat
ter. A man. who had been employed in
the mill of Hickman & Masterson at the
f.->ot of Tenth street, was standing near
The mill office about S o'oclock yesterday
morning. when Policeman Parrel!, who
came jn for more or less notoriety a week
ego by arresting a young girl at her home
ct 2 o'clock in the morning, ordered him to
move on.
"This is a public street, and I am mind
ing my own bufineFf," paid the man with
out budirfnjr from his position.
"Ynu move on or I'll run you in," com
manded the patrolman.
"Let me alone cr 111 break your face,"
was the defiant reply. By this time a.
crowd had collected and it looked as If
there w>u!<3 be trouble. On second
thought the policeman evidently concluded
that the man was not doing any harm and
rftrpated in good order.
The hours of the mlllmen heretofore
havp bwn from 7:30 to 12 and from 12:3rt to
5 o'clock. The demand of the men is that
they po in at S und come out at 12 ami
after noon rest of one hour gn back at 1
and work until 5. The demands of the
.Amalgamated Woodworkers and the
varr.I?hrr? and polishers also went into ef
fect yesterday. With the exception of
<">r.e firm, the \Vest Coayt Furniture Com
pany, the owners accedod to the demands
ar.d as a result 600 men in these depart
ments will hereafter work only eight
hours a day instead of nine.
Says Fight Is Half Won.
P. H. McCarthy, president of the Build-
Ing Trades Council, which has the cnuse
of thÂ«Â» millmen in hand, takes a very
hopeful vipw of the situation. He b*>
lirves thf> mÂ«n have a Just grievance, and
thinks th^y will carry their point.
"The s-atisfactory settlement of the
trouble with the varnlsher*. polishers and
Â¦woodworkers is a good begrinnlns for us."
he said yesterday. "The employers have
PTant^d thrse men what they asked. Only
the millmen are out now. They are the
only branch of the affiliated organization
rot now en.ioyir.s: an eight-hour work day.
Â¦\Y<Â» have prepared for a long and stub
born tight, and v.e think the millowners
win see the folly of further resistance
nr.d accept our proposition. About 400
Tnen are thrown out of work by the shut
ting down of the mills. We have one-half
lhÂ«Â» battle won already."
Mr. McCarthy does not put much faith
Jn the stories that it Is the purpose of
Fom<Â» of th*Â» companies to employ non
xiTiion h^lp from out of town in case the
strike or lockout continues any consJder
8Me time. There are twenty-eight build
ing branches belonging to the union and

r.flff-cted mills, and In the fvent of non

The millowners say their position is a
peremptory one and nothing will make*
them give in. They say the men here
enjoy better hoorn at the oTd rate than do

Day Has Begun.
MACHINERY IDLE
IN PLANING MILLS
BERKELEY. Aug. 13.â All mill workers
belonging to the union -walked out this
morning, their demands for anelght-hour
day not having been granted. Of the
three planing- mills here two employ both
union and non-union men, and one non
union men only. The employes in the non
union mill, owned by George C. Pane, are
all at work. Forty-live nu-n out of sixty
quit work In Niehaus Bros. & Co.'s mill
and five out of twelve In Cavan & Day's.
The men on a strike are all union men,
while the non-union men remain at work.
The vacant places are being tilled and the
mills will continue to operate. No trouble
Is feared, although It Is understood the
owners will place guards over their prop
erty.
MILL-MEN WALK^OUT.
"In Chicago a union man cannot get a
job, and 20.000 men in consequence have
left the city. There the material men
have notified contractors Â¦who employ
union men that they will be expected to
pay cash for whatever they get In the
way of supplies without the customary
discount for cash. It will be the same
way here."
A. Kendall, president of the Pacific
Coast Lumber and Mill Company, stated
In behalf of the owners that he did not
think the strike would last long. He said:
George "W. Smith, president of the Mill
men's Union, said to-day: -
"We are in this fight to stay, and we
will- stay in It until we. win. The mill
workers were burprised at the treatment
received from the owners when nearly 300
woodworkers and mill hands who demand
ed'an eight-hour day were thrown out of
employment. It was a lockout which had
not been anticipated, although we expect
ed a decisive answer one way or another
to-day. We were proceeding for a settle
ment of this question along the lines of
equity. â¢ \ -
. "As to the Importation of men to take
our places, I do not think that will work
well. Even if the mill/ owners have fin
ished supplies on hand, it will do them
no good. They cannot use the stuff. The
carpenters will not handle it. the brick
layers, plasterers and lathers will not
touch It and there will be no use In trying
to place it on the market. i
"We have behind us the united support
of the Building Trades Council, therefore
we have reasons to believe we are going
to win."

Acute catarrh of the upper bowels in

, KEITH WAZEMAN AS SAPHO.
mANAGER T. DANIEL FRAW
LEY has decided to produce
â¢â¢Sapho" at the Grand Opera
house next week. The title role
will be played by Miss Keith Wakeman,
who, like Rosalind, "is more than common
tall," of magnificent physique and emi
nently fitted for. the part. ; . ..
Madame Rejane's version of; the play
will be used, Manager Frawley having se
cured the coast rights. Critics claim that
this Is the moat literal translation of any
ol the dramatizations. Miss wakeman
was in Paris and saw the famous actresa
in the part night after night, and has* all
the "business" down to perfection.
Miss Wakeman played the leading: role
In "Sapho" at I-os Anpreles recently, and
the dramatic critics of that city were
unanimous in their praise of her ability.
There is a sort of rosy glow about this promise of
reform that is very charming, and it is to be hoped
the dawn it heralds will soon burst forth in the splen
dor of full day. Of course to introduce the improve
ments into all homes will call for the remodeling of
rr:any houses and perhaps the pulling down of most,
but those sre slight things. It is certainly easier to
tear down all dwellings and build new ones than to
solve the servant-girl question by improving the girl.
Boston has shown th- way to a better condition of
things, and now let her take the lead and realize it
The kitchen is recognized as the difficult feature of
the reform programme, and of that it is s?.yl: "When
housekeeping is reorganized on a business basis the
present waste and drudgery and dirt in the house
kitchen will be abolished, and along with the soap
inaking will go the soupmaking and breadmaking â
the heavy kettles and greasy dishes. The cleaning of
fowls, the trimming of vegetables will be done out
side the house, and that bete noire, the garbage pail,
iviH be reduced to min2geable dimensions."
FUTURE HOUSEKEEPING.
rROM Boston comes a new contribution to the
servant-girl question. It is a suggestion that in
stead of trying to reform the servant girl the
housekeepers cf the bnd should direct their energies
toward a reform of domestic service. This reform is
to begin by so improving the construction of the
home that household work of all kinds can be done
vrithout drudgery. By the aid of scientific appliances
it is to be made possible to sweep rooms, make beds
and do the general cleaning with neatness and dis
patch, so that the housekeeper and her daughters can
do the whole thing without getting mussed up or
wean'. Â«

1 â n. ISPATCHES from Atlanta announce that
I ) since the recent election in North Carolina, at
* â^ which there was adopted a constitutional
amendment virtually abolishing negro suffrage in the
State, a movement to accomplish a similar result has
been started in Georgia. Prominent members of the
Legislature have declared an intention to propose
such an amendment to the Georgia constitution at
the next session and it is probable the plan will be
carried out.
Several schemes have been devised for excluding
the negro from the polls without violating the con
stitution of the United States and the original Missis
sippi plan has been exceeded in one way or another
by each successive State that has followed the lead.
That just adopted in North Carolina is the most
drastic and will doubtless be the one most closely
imitated by the Georgians. It declares:
Every person presenting himself for registration shall
be able to read and write any section of the constitu
tion In the English language; and, before he shall be
entitled to vote, he shall have paid on or before tha
first day of May. of the year In which he proposes to
vote, his poll tax for the previous year, as proscribed
by article 5, section 1 of the constitution. But no male
person who was on January 1, 1867, or .it any time prior
thereto, entitled to \vote under the laws of any State
in the United States wherein he then resided, and no
lineal descendant of any such person, shall be denied
the right to register nnd vote at any election in this
State by reason of his failure to possess the educational
qualification herein described, provided he shall have
registered in accordance with the terms of this section
prior to December 1, 1903.
It will be seen the amendment imposes an educa
tional and taxpaying qualification upon negroes, but
net upon the whites. Thus there will be no incentive
to advance the education of the negroes, and as they
will have no votes, the chances are the dominant
white race will not burden itself to support any con
siderable number of public schools for the blacks.
More than that; there will be no political force in the
South to guarantee the personal and property rights
of the blacks and as a consequence the whole situa
tion in that section of the Union is to be materially
altered for the worse.
The amendment was carried in North Carolina by
the activity of "red shirt" clubs and is therefore an
outcome of violence rather than of reason. It is to
be regarded as a partisan measure in the strictest
sense. The object is to make the South solid for
Democracy and as a result there will inevitably be a
protest against it from the people of the North. In
fact, that. protest is already heard from various quar
ters, and when^he time comes to apportion Represen
tatives under the census of this year it is certain ef-
THE SOUTH AND THE. NEGRO.
Observation of the excellent effect of leasing the
grazing lands of Texas has worked a change in West
ern opinion on that subject and there seems to be
I'othing now in the \\s.y of passage of a leasing act.
provided it originates in the West and that it protects
efficiently the rights of ?mall stockmen as well as
large, docs justice to abutting land-owners and im
poses no restriction uj'on actual settlers and mineral
prospectors. No law without these features ought to
pass. But one that squarely meets these conditions
and is left optional to counties west of the ninety
riinth meridian will prss and will work wonders for
the development of the West.
The result* is the sudden conversion of large num
bers of stockmen to the leasing policy, and their con
cession, thereunder, of rights to land-owners and
small stockmen, of leasehold rights on the range,
wliich have heretofore been denied them on the free
range. The opinion of a large number of land
owners and small stockmen was recently expressed
to the effect that they would rather pay 5 cents an
acre for leased range than have unprotected range
jyyi OST of the opposition to leasing the public
/ \ domain in regions where it is more valuable
* * for grazing than anything else has come
from quarters where the benefits of a leasehold in ex
clusive occupancy arc already enjoyed through viola
tions of the law against fencing the public domain.
This inclosing of the free range and prevention of its
free use began in one of the necessities of the graz
ing business. Cattle would drift away to places wher;
there was but little water and when this was gone
would perish for want of it. Hence the custom arose
of putting in "drift fences." From this plan to keep
stock within reach of permanent water grew up the
fencing of the whole range to secure its exclusive oc
cupancy. But this is forbidden by law and the Secre
tary of the Interior is having these fences removed.
Hundreds of miles of them have been taken down.
THE FREE RANGE.
"SAPHO" TO BE PRODUCED
AT GRAND OPERA-HOUSE
Such is the programme of labor in British politics,
and it is not at all an extravagant one Great Brit
ain has been regarded as the most conservative coun
try in Europe, and it may now take the lead in the
march to socialism as another illustration that it is
always the unexpected that happens.
For the^purpose of advancing socialism Mr. Hardie
suggests that the labor representatives in Parliament
form a group to themselves, ready to act at any given
time with any party which will be most compliant to
socialistic demands. He says: "The radicals in Par
liament, together with the Irish party, would prob
ably find common ground of action with such a group,
and as a result there would be a fighting force of,
say, 120. Resolutely led, by taking advantage of
every opportunity, it would steadily become a power
in the land, causing the Whigs to go over in form as
well as in spirit to their natural friends, the Tories,
and bringing the nation face to face with the straigh*
issue â socialism versus capitalism."
As to the programme of action after election, Mr.
Hardie says: "The principle of unity in the labor
movement in all lands is socialism, and, since there is
ho other possible, so it will be here. * * * The
coming of socialism is already admitted. Tories and
Liberals vie with each other at election times in for
mulating platforms which savor more and more of
socialism. Municipalities- are rapidly developing the
socialist spirit. It is estimated that in Great Britain
Â£400,000,000 worth of property is owned and con
trolled by municipal corporations in the form of land,
houses, .gas, water works, trams and the like. So
alarming has this side of socialism become to the
propertied- classes that the appointment of a parlia
mentary committee ha> been secured to consider how
best to check the movement. On the other hand,
mine-owners and railway companies, by their exor
bitant and vexatious charges, are bringing the na
tionalization of mines and railways well within the
sphere of practical politics."
There arc now twelve labor members in the House
of Commons. Each of these will seek re-election.
The Independent Labor party will nominate at least
twelve more, and may nominate as many as twenty
five. The trades unions will place ten ortwelve can
didates in constituencies not contested by the inde
pendents, and the Social Democratic Federation will
also contest a few seats. Altogether Mr. Hardie es
timates that not less than fifty candidates will go to
the polls under the auspices of the united labor par
ties, and he considers tha^ upward of half of them
will have a fair chance of election.
After pointing out that in the past the workingmen
of the unions have been divided between the Conser
vative and the Liberal parties, and that the efforts of
some of the unions to organize an independent labor
party have been antagonized not only by Tories bui
by radicals as well, he says the collapse of liberalism
since the death of Gladstone has prepared the way
for all radicals to act with the independent movement,
and accordingly that movement is to have from this
time forward a much greater force and momentum
than ever before. -.V:^ V
SOCIALISM IN BRITISH POLITICS.
KEIR HARDIE, who for some time' past has
been the ablest and most influential leader
among the organized workingmen ' of Grest
Britain/and who represents an important constituency
in Parliament, sets forth in the August number of
the Eorum a prospectus of what is likely to be the
political programme of the labor unions ol the king
dom in the coming general elections. It is essen
tially a programme of socialism, and presages the be
ginning of a radically new era in British politics.

No comment is needed. The Examiner could not
have more exactly traversed Bryan's acceptance
speech if it had been possessed of a very advanced
copy. Yet that paper and Mr. Hearst's New York
and Chicago organs ask anti-expansionists and gold
Democrats to leave the silver question dead in the
morgue and put in power a Bryan administration, to
be subject to such unprincipled influence.
We think both "classes will answer the lure as
Thomas II. Benton did the inquiry whether he would
support his son-in-law, Fremont, for the Presidency:
"Not in the daytime, *ir: not in the daytime."
It is perhaps worth while to point out that the
"simple machinery of our popular domestic Govern-'
ment" of which Mr. Cleveland speaks will neither be
changed at home nor employed abroad should It be
come necessary to administer outside .dependencies. Â¦ It
is in the power and right of Congress to devise any sort
of system that may apply to the conditions of such
dependencies, and this power Is in no wise limited by
the national constitution, nor does its application In
volve any modification of our domestic system. All this
was pointed out and explained in the recent decision
written by Judge Morrow of the Circuit Court of
Appeals on the Alaska liquor cases.
All these things which we have stated are familiar
knowledge, but they do not appear to make part of
the intellectual equipment of tha superior person, who
puts his faith in adjectives and expects people to take
him for granted.
Let us examine the adjectives. "Monarchical haz
ard?." The most remarkable example in the history
of the world of the assumption of hazards such as Mr.
Cleveland indicates with fear and abhorrence is furn
ished by England, and in faith England has prospered
indifferently well under all that load of "monarchical
hazards." The fact that (England's institutions are as
free and as democratic as our own; the fact that the
English nation is the most powerful and 'the most en
lightened in the Old World, despite its "schemes of
imperialism"â these facts and others of like tenor and
meaning do not appear to affect Mr. Cleveland's pho
phetic vision, and he leaves us to infer his belief that
"in the light of history and reason such positions bring
in their train a people's demoralization."
The dear old "landmarks!" The â¢nicked "monarchical
hazards:" The abominable "schemes of imperialism!"
Tftese are the familiar commonplaces of the superior
person doing duty in the muddy vesture of pomposity;
but. after all, calling names, even names of many syl
lables, is not argument. It is the vice of the superior
person to pin. his cause to an adjective propelled by
the weight o? a self-important personality.
"When you come to analyze the stuffing, it is disap
pointing. The air of pretension with which the wisdom
cf our "wisest and best" is put forward seems scarcely
justified by the solemn stupidities of ponderous
commonplace, which they found on doubtful facts, and
the disasters they predict should their advice be dis
regarded. The heat and burden of Mr. Cleveland's
prophetic soul are described by him like this:
"If, then, the suggestion is made that the time has
come for our nation to abandon its landmarks and to
follow, the lights of monarchical hazards, and that we
should attempt to employ the simple machinery of our
popular and domestic Government to serve the schemes
of imperialism, your challenge of the proposition is
entirely in order. If you are satisfied that foreign con
quest and unnatural extension or annexation are dan
gerous perversions of our national mission, and if it shall
seem to you in the light of reason and history that
such positions bring in their train a people's demoraliza
tion and a decay of popular content, more surely de
structive to the republic than armies with banners, you
will not necessarily be wrong."
One more of the "wisest and best" has spoken. "When
Professor Norton announced that the American people
had been driven into this war against the advice of their
"wisest and best," he surely included Grover Cleveland
in that category of arrogant assumption. The stuffed
prophet â to borrow the phrase of one who knew him
wellâ has proclaimed his disapproval of the war and
his hostility to any extension of territory.
We reproduce in full this Examiner editorial,
printed less than two years ago, to which we invite
the attention of genuine anti-expansionists and the
gold Democrats. Under the caption, "The Superior
Person," the Examiner said:
The insincerity of the Examiner and the flippant
flexibility of its principles may- be shown by a little
backsight. Not long ago it boasted almost a copy
right of the phrase "little Americans," as applied to
all who opposed holding the Philippines, to which it
demanded that we "nail the flag."
THE Examiner is ecstatic over Colonel Bryan's
first Â¦ acceptance speech. In several kinds of
type, all large,- it quotes from and commends
that oration as if it were the first reference to the sub
jects treated, and came from an inspired prophet. It
speaks of Republican opposition to-free silver as do
ing "the ghoul act with a buried issue," and boasts
that "they will find the morgue deserted and the peo
ple lined up on the burning questions that live and
confront them." It characterizes the speech as "a
clear-cut gospel based on the constitution," to which
"no Republican logician can cleave to the constitu
tion and truthfully reply."
This rhapsody is addressed to Colonel Bryan's de
nunciation of expansion and his views on the Philip
pines, which would never have been among our af
flictions had he not lobbied to ratify the treaty of
Paris.

TRILBY," the ever-pcpular. is the J
offering of the New Frawleys this
II week at the Grand Opera-house, an.l
last night saw the big house filled
from floor to ceiling with a crowd appre
ciative to the actual echo of the "Ben
Bolt" banality, and Zou-Zou's fetching
"La-la-lalala!"
, Of Trilby itself there is nothing left to
i say. No plot or play is probably more
familiar to the theater-going public than
this dramatization of Du Maurier's book,
and but few plays seem to arouse the
curious kind of personal affection with
which this gloriously impossible creation
is regarded; hence the inevitable crowd
and appreciation. Three figures stand out
prominently in the castâ Trilby, Svengali
and Zou-Zou, and an equaiy measure of
praise is the meed of each. >
As Trilby, MLss Van Buren achieved a
distinct success. From her first apoear
ance In the studio of the three, arf tne
barefooted, big-hearted, top-coated .cam
arade, to her exit as the dying Mme.
bvengali, famous, wealthy, beautiful.
Miss Van Buren's Trilby was a gracious
conception. Picturesque, lovable, sym
metrical, the part may be placed with
this clever actress' best work. The
musical Jew, Svengali, with his hypnotic
peculiarities, is a deservedly famous
creation of Wilton Lackaye/s. His make
up is marvelously clever, "and the mes
meric business would do credit to a
Kennedy. He rises to a fine climax in the
death scene, which is as good a thing In
its way as Mr. Lackaye has ever done.
Zou-Zou, the effervescent, sparkling
young Due do la Rochemartel. was ex
cellently well done by Ignaclo Martinetti.
who seems to have more temperament
and nerve than the rest of the
cast combined. Little Billee was fairly
well played by Henry Roberts and Har
rington Reynolds and H. S. Duffleld did
good work with Taffy and Sandy. Phosa
McAllister's Mme. Vlnard was a careful
and conscientious portrait â she is always
to be relied uponâ and for the rest the
work was acceptable. â¢_
In spite of rather long waits the play
went exceedingly well, the stage-setting,
notably in the second scene, was excep-
tlonal'.y admirable, and the "business;; of
the famous studio scene was ver>
erly arranged. ,

Moreover, the South may lose industrially as well
as politically by the new policy. In a review of the
subject in the current number of the Forum the
Hon. Charles Grosvenor of, Ohio, after briefly de
scribing how much ithe South; has prospered during
the thirty years of negro suffrage and how much has
been gained by both races, says: "It will be marvel
ous if disfranchisement does not stop all or practically
all progress in this direction. What has the colored
man to look forward to? Why should he educate
himself and his children? He will retrace the steps
he has taken toward good citizenship more rapidly
than he has advanced. It is the history of the world
and there is no escape from the blighting effects."
The tendencies of the new policy will, of course, be
closefy watched from'the North, and while there is
every desire on the part of all to avoid another issue
of a sectional character, yet it may be forced by the re
sults of this wholesale disfranchisement of voters. It
is a desperate game that the Southern leaders have
undertaken to play and the consequences to them
may be almost as direful as secession itself.

H. Monsen, a Cook, Swears That
They Stole His Valise and
Money.
H. Monsen, a cook living- at 51 Clay
street, swore to a complaint in Judge Ca
banlss' court yesterday for the arrest of.
Coney Galgan, a peddler, on the charge
of grand larceny. Monsen alleges that
Galgan and two other peddlers stole his
valise last Tuesday, which contained $260
in coin and a new suit of clothes. O. Cun
ningham, said to be another of the trio,
was arrested last night.
Monsen had been cook at the leper hos
pital for some months. He quit last Tues
day. Putting his money and clothes Into
thv valise he celebrated the event of his
leaving. While he was under the influ
ence of liquor the three peddlers made
their appearance with muskmelons. They
offered to take Monsen's valise to 51 Clay
street an>1 drove away with it. Since then
Monscr. has not seen or heard of them.
PEDDLERS ACCUSED OF
GRAND LARCENY
Says Slie Assisted in Forcing Him
to Sign Note at Point of
Pistol.
John Richardson, the machinist who
was compelled to sign a promissory note
for $100 at the point of a pistol, as related
In yesterday's Call, swore to a warrant
yesterday charging Olive Breneman, alias
Olive Gardner, one of the alleged con
spirators, with extortion. She waa ar
rested shortly afterward and locked up in
the City Prison. The woman was Rich
ardson s housekeeper, and. according to
his story, she and a man for whom the
detectives are looking entered his private
apartments shortly after midnight Satur
day and forced him to sign his name to a
promissory note. The man, Richardson
says, held a revolver to hi? head and
threatening to make him a subject for the
Coroner, compelled him to sign the note,
after which he and the woman left the
house. ,
Mrs. Breneman emphatically denies that
she was a party to the crime. She says
that Saturday night Richardson choked
her and as she feared that he intended
to kill her, she left his home and rented
a room in a lodginp-house on Market
Ftreet. She claims that sho waa engaged
to be married to Richardson, but this is
denied by him.
Richardson adheres to his original
statement that the woman was one of the
conspirators and he Intends to vigorously
prosecute her on the charge of extortion.

Wholesalers Sign Promise Not to Sell
to Consumers, Large Hotels
Excepted.
There is rejoicing among the legion oÂ£_
retail grocery dealers. in the city over
a promise by the wholesale grocers not
to sell to ordinary consumers. A docu
ment setting forth this promise has been
signed by nearly every wholesale grocer
In San Francisco. The exceptions aro
firms' dealing principally with shipping
and they do not, according to President
Alpers of the Retail Grocers* Association,
cut much figure with the local trade. No
threat was made for non-compliance with
the demand of the retailers, but there
was some talk about establishing closer
relations with the broker3 if the whole
salers were obstinate.
The wholesalers, retailers and brokers
or manufacturers' agents were all inter
ested. Still another large class, hearing
of what was going on, manifested con
cern but could take no part in the pro
ceedings. These were the keepers of pri
vate boarding-houses and proprietors of
smaller restaurants. They have been ac
customed - to buying, small lots from
wholesale grocers. The retailers particu
larly have objected to this practice.
The wholesalers claimed that the large
hotels should be excepted from the rulÂ«
suggested by the retailers, because such
hotels purchase In very large quantities,
and this was conceded.

We now come to a great name In the
history of American exploration. Rene-
Robert Caveller, "Sleur de la Sarle, waa
born In 1643 of a wealthy merchant fam
ily of Rouen. In 1666 he came to Canada
to seek his fortune, and In the course of
the next twelve years engaged In busi
ness as a fur trader, and traveled exten
sively in the wilderness south of lakes
For several days they paddled on with
out seeing the faintest trace of human
habitation. At length, on the 25th, they
found a well-trodden path on the west
bank, leading from the river Inland. Leav
ing their men behind, the two leaders
followed the path for several miles, until
they reached an Indian village on the
banks of a stream which may have been
the Des Moines. Here they were hespit
ably received. "Frenchmen, how bright
the sun shines- when you come to visit
us," said the chief, holding up his hands
as If to shield his eyes. Marquette, who
knew several Indian languages, had no
difficulty in addressing them. The chief
replied in flattering terms, 1 assuring them
that "their presence added flavor to his
tobacco, made the river more calm, the
sky more serene and the earth more beau
tiful." A feast followed, in which a large
dog, killed and cooked for the occasion,
was a prominent dish. On the following
morning the hospitable Indiansâ â¬00 In
numberâ escorted their white, guests to
their canoes and bade them farewell.
Slowly they drifted down the river.
When nearly opposite the present site of
Alton their superstitious fears and antipa
thies were aroused at the sight of two
hideous monsters painted on the rocks by
the Indians as representations of their
gods. Many years later. long after the
effigies had disappeared, came the money
worshipping white man and put in the
place of the Indian deities a huge adver
tisement of "plantation bitters.
Presently a rer.1 danger appeared as a
torrent of yellow mud rushed furiously
athwart the calm current of the Missis
sippi. boiling, surging and sweeping in Its
course logs, hranches and uprooted trees.
It was the Missouri, and on its turbid
flood the light canoes were tossed In an
alarming way. for Marquette wrote: "I
never saw anything more terrific. But
they escaped Injury and floated down,
past the site of St. Louis, then, of course,
an unbroken wilderness, and past .the
mouth of the Ohio, the "Beautiful River
of the French. Northern trees began to
give place to the straight -stems and
feathery plumes to cane brakes, and the
heat of the sun became each day more
difficult to endure. When near the mouth
of the- Arkansas River they decided to
retrace their course. Nothing would be
gained by following the Mississippi far
ther, for they now knew that It emptied
Into the Gulf of Mexico. So on the 17th
of July they turned their canoes north
ward and began their long and -weary
journey homeward. They followed the
Mississippi until they reached the mouth
of the Illinois, went up that river some
distance, then with Indian guides crossed
the country to Lake Michigan, andâcoast
ing along its shore reached Green Bay at
the close of September. They had been
gone about four months and had paddled
their canoe somewhat more than 2500
miles.
On the 17th of May, 1673. the two lead
ers, with five men, started on their ad
venturous journey from the Straits of
Michillimackinac. In their two birch
bark canoes they coasted along the north
ern shore of Lake Michigan and down on
the west to the head of Green Bay. There
they entered and went up the Fox River,
crossed Lake Winnebaso. then followed
the river beyond through endless growths
of wild rice, from which the frightened
wild fowl rose in great flocks. With the
help of Indian guides they passed from
the Fox River to the Wisconsin, upon
which they launched their canoes, not
knowing whether their destination was
the Gulf of Mexico or the Pacific. On
June 17 they saw before them the broad
current of the Mississippi, and. reaching
It, turned their canoes southward, "with
a great joy which I cannot express,"
wrote Marquette.
When Frontenac became Governor of
Canada, in 1672, he commissioned Louis
Jollet and Jacques Marquette to discover
and explore the river. Joliet waa a young
man, 27 years of age. who had been edu
cated for the priesthood but had chosen
instead the life of a fur trader. His com
panion. Marquette. was 35 years old and
had already made his mark as a zealous
Jesuit missionary.
white men for 132 years, and the fact of
its discovery was well-nigh faded out of
memory. Distorted accounts of it from
the Indians reached the French In Cana
da, awakening curiosity and suggesting a
new trade route to the ocean, though
whether it would lead to the Atlantic or
the Pacific was long a matter of conjec
ture. The prevailing opinion for awhile
was that It emptied into the Vermillion
Seaâ namely, the Gulf of California.

Evidence of the fact that the German
"war lord" expects a prolonged and seri
ous conflict In China Is accumulating rap
idly in this city. The latest proof of the
fact that he means business and that the
almond-eyed barbarians will have to set
tle accounts with him is the arrival here
of representatives of the German army
and of the two great steamship lines of
the Fatherland.
Among the guests that registered at the
Palace last night' were Major von Klelst
and Lieutenants vonBorcke and Von Loen
of the Kaiser's army, and Messrs. Berg
mann. Hupfeld and Lobenstein. repre
sentatives of the North German Lloyd and
the Hamburg-American steamship compa
nies. The army men are from Berlin and
the others from Hamburg. Elsewhere is
told the story of the approaching arrival
of ten transports, which will be employed
to convey animals and supplies to the
German soldiers In China.
"We are here." paid Major von Kleist,
"as a result of the complications in the
Chinese realm. Myself and Lieutenants
von Borcke ana I.oen are detailed to su
pervise, the purchase of horses, mules,
forage and general food supplies for the
German army in China, and the other
gentlemen In our party will devote their
attention to expediting the docking, load
ing and forwarding of the transports that
are to arrive here from Germany. Owing
to the situation on the. other side of the
Pacific It will be necessary to do fast
work In the transportation of army sup
plies. Whether or. not we can accomplish
this feat remains to be seen. Our stay
here is scheduled indefinitely and depends
entirely on developments In the Far
East."
The German Government is doing busi
ness through TV. R. Grace & Co.. who are
acting as the Emperor's agents. It is
stated that one of their commissions is
to purchase 5000 horses and mules to be
shipped to China, with the necessary sup
ply of forage. They Â¦will also be the pur
chasing agents In connection With the
commissary department. It Is further an
nounced that the firm in question has ac
cumulated a large number of horses that
are now being- broken and trained for the
service near Baden. "
The demand for horses has been so
great during the past two years that the
market is practically barren, and prices
are on the jump.â The United States Gov
ernment Is still in the field after a large
number cf equlnes, and the gentlemen
from Germany will find serious difficulty
in securing their required quota. >>

As an instance of the value of this kind

Phylloxera, powdery mildew and sun
burn may assail the wine vineyards of
California, but the industry of preparing
the grape juice for the public stomach,
so far as its fame is concerned, continues
to prosper. Consumers of the wholesome
beverage who have long been prejudiced
in favor of the French product are discov
ering that In 'the land of gold there are
produced wines that compare favorably
with the best in the world.
The men who make the 'wines' that are
bringing fame to. the California vine
yards and cellars say. that the worst ene

Americansâ those who are faddists and
think that nothing good can come from

they are gradually discovering their er

what it ought to be.

a new champion of the Golden State vint

it Is. On the ground of merit and possi

the New York Central" Railway Company
has undertaken to popularize the wines
of California by giving them prominence,
not only on its wine lists on the dining

After De Soto's ill-starred expedition
the great river remained unvisited 'by
Men of rank and full of the spirit of
adventure were eager to join his standard,
so that he had no difflculty in collecting
"a band as gallant and well appointed, as
eager in purpose and audacious In hope as
ever trod the shores of the New "World."
They landed, 120 strong, at Tampa Bay,
Florida, in 1539. We know, of course, what
awaited them and how Impossible of ful
fillment were their golden dreams. But
how could they know it beforehand? They
wandered about in the present States of
Florida. Georgia, Alabama and Mississip
pi, until in the third year, in 1541, they
reached a great river, "almost hall a
league wide, deep, rapid and constantly
rolling down trees and driftwood on its
turbid current." It was the Mississippi,
the "father of waters," now seen for the
first time by white men. They crossed the
river at the lowest Chickasaw bluff and
continued their wanderings on the other
side until it was evident to all that their
enterprise was a complete failure. Then
they returned to the river, and De Soto,
his proud spirit completely broken, suc
cumbed to his misfortunes and died. To
keep his body from the Indians hi3 com
panions sunk it at midnight in the river.
There was now no thought in any mind
but that of escape from the terrible wil
derness. Kventually the survivors, only
one-half the original number, half-clad,
sickly and starving, made their way down
the river and reached a Spanish settle
ment.
IX.
The achievements of Cortez and Pizarro
In conquering the wealthy kingdoms of
Mexico and Peru stimulated the ambi
tion and cupidity of Spaniards and turned
attention to the unexplored regions north
of the gulf. What more likely than that
a third golden harvest In that quarter
awaited the clutch of a strong and daring
hand? Hernando de Soto marked these
Imaginary riches for his prey. He had
accompanied Pizarro to Peru, and on re
turning to Spain organized an expedition
to repeat Pizarro's work in the vast re
gion then known as Florida.
On the 3d of November the party, now
increased to thirty-three, started in eight
canoes up the Saint Joseph River to a
point near the present site of South Bend.
After some delay in finding the way they
carried their canoes over the portase of
five miles and launched them again on
the Kankakee. one of the headwaters of
the Illinois River. The stream floated
them on "through a voiceless, lifeless
solitude of dreary oak barrens or bound
less marshes overgrown with reeds."
After a few days they passed through a
wide prairie "strewn with the carcasses
ar>>1 bleached skulls of Innumerable buf
falo." At the place where the present
village of Ut'ca, La Salla County. Illtnoi?,
stands they passed through a large Indian
town. Hennepin counted 460 lodges, in
shape like the arched tops of emigrant
wagons, and intended to hold six or eight
families apiece. But all was silent as the
grave. The Indians were off on their win
ter hunt. Lower down the river they
found the Indians, who tried to dissuade
them from going farther, telling theiri
great stories about the dangers, natural
and supernatural, that lay before them.
Terrified by what they heard, six of La
Salle's men. including two of his be3t
carpenters, deserted. This was a serious
blow. It showed La Salle that he could
not depend upon his men.

Tale University, will be concluded on
Tuesday next.
Ontario and Erie. He thus became ac
quainted with the natural resources of
that region and determined to find an
outlet for it by way of the Mississippi
River. As a base of operations he secured
from the King a grant of Fort Frontenac.
at the entrance to the St. Lawrence River,
where Kingston no* stands. He also se
cured the services of two men whoso
names often recur in accounts of the ex
plorations of that period. One of these
was Henri de Tonty, who now attached
himself to La Salle and served him ever
after with the utmost fidelity. The other
was Father !.<>uis Hennepin. a Itecollet
friar, extremely fond of adventure, who,
after a short connection with La Salle.
was destined to secure fame by hla inde
pendent explorations.
At the beginning of Ifi79 La Salle w^3
ready to start for the Mississippi, so he.
with Tonty and Hennenin and a party o?
thirty, crossed over from Fort Frontenao
to the Niagara Kiver. Here his first care
was to establish a fortitlert station near
the mouth of the river, and next to buikl
a ship above the falls in which to navi
gate the upper lakes. The place chosen
for the shipyard was at the mouth of
Cayuga Creek, on the American .-side, near
the present village of La Salle. When,
spring opened the little ship of forty-five
tons was launched, the forerunner of the
merchant lUets to gather centuries later
at the future port of Buffalo. The littla
craft was named the Grifiln. On the 7th,
of August, when all was ready. La Sails
and his company went on bouril, the "To
Deum" was sung, five small cannon popped
off a brave saiute and the adventurous
voyage was commenced. "A fresh breezo
sprang up, and with the swelling canvas
the Grifnn plowed the virgin waves of
Lake Erie, where sail was never seen be
fore." In due time they reached Michil
limackinac, where the French had a well
known trading station. Going ashore to>
the bark chapel of the Ottawa village, !.â¢&
Salle, in his mantle of scarlet and gold,
knelt at the altar and gave thanks for his
safe voyage.
He was now beset with anxieties on ac
count of the dishonesty and treachery of
fur traders in his employ. Troubles like
these, and more serious harassment from
jealous rivals and hostile creditors, he was
often called upon to endure, for he was
stern and cold, and usually failed in at
taching to himself men of his own race.
He was, however, remarkably gifted Irt
winning the admiration and devotion of
the Indians, whom he knew exactly how
to manage. To straighten out his affairs*
he now decided to send the Griffin back to
Niagara with a valuable load of furs, to
be forwarded to Fort Frontenac. She set
sail on the 18th of September and was
never heard from again. A storm arose
soon after she started, and in that sha
probably foundered.
La Salle and Hennepin and a party oC
fourteen men resumed their journey in
four canoes. They paddled down the
western s'de of Lake Michigan, encounter
ing great hardships from lack of food and,
stormy weather. Reaching the southern
end of the lake, they rounded it and went
up the eastern side to the River Saint
Joseph, which they entered the 1st of
November. Here they were joined by
Tonty. who had been sent with a detach
ment down the eastern side of the lake.
The war In China and the murder of the
German Minister have evidently made
things hum In the "fatherland." A -fleet
of warships Is "on the way to Shanghai,
soldiers are being sent to the Orient and
supply vessels are on their way to San
Francisco to carry supplies to the forces.
From this port all the German soldiers
in China, will receive supplies of provi
sions and all the governments interested
in the situation are now calculating on
using San Francisco as a forwarding
port
Germany has ten steamers on the way
here to load supplies and horses for her
men in China. The Aachen. 2447 tons, and
the Dresden, 2S66 tons, were at Bremen
July 26; the H. H. Meier, 3260 tons, was
on the Weser July 26; the Halle, 2561 tons,
was at Bremen July 10; the Rhein. b39s
tons, was at Bremen July 19:' the Stras
burg, 6500 tons, was at Bremen July 20;
the Adrea was at Hamburg July 16; the
Batavla, 6510 tons, was at Bremen July
24; the Phonlx. 1376 tons, was in the
Gulf of Mexico a few days ago, and the
Sardinia, 2269 tons, was at Bremerhaven
on July 24.
All these vessels are now on their way
to San Francisco, arid each one of them
will load supplies for the German army
in China. On their arrival here they will
be taken in hand by the German Consul,
who will superintend the loading and dis
patch of the transports.
The chances are that all these steamers
will get here within a week of each other,
and in consequence Chief Wharfinger Per
cy Henderson and Assistant Chief George
H. S. Dryden have their thinking cape on.
At the present moment the wharves are
crowded, but In a short space of time
Howard-street wharf No. 3 will be ready
for occupancy, and Folsom 2 and Harri
son will be clear of the transports. If
these wharves can be kept clear there
will be no difficulty in providing wharf
room for the German .transports when
they arrive.

Water Front Notes.
Captain Buchanan of the British ship
Beechbank is at outs with George XV. Mc-
Xear and his deputies. McNear owns a
well at Port Costa, and the British ship
captains assert the water Is no good. Mc-
Near naturally wants to fill the tanks of
every vessel that loads at his docks, and
the captains all shy at the proposition.
Captain Buchanan of the Beechbank was
in town Friday, and during his absence a
man went aboard and told the mate that
the captain had ordered the vessel sup
plied with water. The mate demurred,
but the apent was persistent, so the ship's
water tanks were filled. The Beechbank
is now in the stream, and Captain Buch
anan refuses to go to sea with the Port
Costa water. The water-boat Sea Witch
has been ordered alongside to-day, and as
f-oon as the Port Costa water has been
pumped out Spring Valley will take Its
place.
Trouble on the Beechbank.
Mate Emmett of the British bark Du
nc-arn had an experience on May 6 that he
will not forget In a hurry. A big sea
swept the ship and carried him overboard.
Luckily he had hold of the main brace,
and held on until assistance came. He
was hauled aboard more dead than alive
and was taken to his room. Before the
accident the Dunearn had been battling
with the elements for fourteen days, and
all hands had a terrible time of it.
Mate Swept Overboard.
The new American four-masted bark
Edward Sewall arrived from Baltimore
via Montevideo yesterday. The ship Is
almost a counterpart of the Ersklne M.
Phelps, due any day from Honolulu, but
has not made as successful a start as that
vessel. When off the River Platte the
Edward Sewall's cargo of coal became
heated. In spite of the water that washed
over the bow the crew found the deck
uncomfortably hot at times, and finally
t^ie captain decided to run Into Monte
video. There it was found necessary to
dlscharpe 1000 tons of the coal In order to
save the ship. The discharged cargo was
Fold at auction and the ship came on to
San Francisco. The run from Montevideo
to this port was uneventful.

Spanish Proverbs.
Proverbs uncomplimentary to the fair
sex are common In Spain. "A woman, like
a pavement; should be well trampled on
to be kept in order." "A woman is like
a candle; twist her neck if you wish her
to be good." "Beware of bad women and
do not trust a good one." "Cryins in a
woman and limping In a dog is all a
sham." "A cock crows on his own dung
hill, but hens cackle everywhere" (this is
reference to the supposed garrulousness,
and inquisitive disposition of her sex).
"Show me a magpie without a spot and I
will show ybu a woman without a fault."
In English counterparts are not wanting.
For exampleâ
A woman, a dog and a walnut treeâ .,
The more you - beat them the better they be.
Mothers-in-law and stepmothers come In
for a good deal of, sarcasm. Some of the
proverbs In resrard'to them will not stand
translation. Of a man who Is accounted
lucky they say: "If he fell from the roof
of a house he would Â¦ fall on trie top of
his mother-in-law."â Chambers' Journal.

CHICAGO, Aug. 13â Wheat began the day
decidedly weak under the influence if weak
cables and heavy Southwestern receipts.-.Liver
pool was off l%rt and receipts at Kansas City
footing up 750,000 bushels broke all records.
Influenced by this kind of information there
were hosts of people with wheat to sell and few
people to buy It at anything like Saturdays
closing figures. September opened %@lc lower
at 7l'Â«c to 74V4c and dropped speedily to 74V&C.
Coverfng by chorts for profits steadied the
market at this point and gradually forced
some recovery. Later reports of damages from
excessive rains In the Northwest from sprout
ing: and of a prospect of more trouble fhouid
the rains continue caused a further recovery.
Cash sales of about 200.000 bushels were also
a help. September slowly clambered up to
74*i*/'74?ic and closed firm, only a shade under
Saturday at T&AfpTVAc
Corn stacgered under a rush to sell at the
opening. The corn belt had been drenched with
rain, save in Central and Western Kansas.
Country offerings were freer and Liverpool
weak. The recovery in the latter caused a
rally and the close was firm, %c under Sat
urday, at 37%c.
Oats were relatively firm; September closed
He lower at 21*Â»c
Provisions were quiet and steady despite large
hog receipts and lower prices at the yards.
Even the early grain weakness failed to in
fluence much of a reduction. September pork
closed a s-h:iile lower, lard 5c down and rlb3
SMi'&i'C depressed.

I therefore do accuce the said William I\
Sullivan Jr. of being guilty of malfeasance In
office to wit: Willful misconduct in office con
trary to and in violation of section 758 of the
Penal Code of the State of Californa, and do
respectfully demand that he be by you accused
thereof, as required by the provisions of the
law above referred to. I hereby request that
you designate a time and place for the pro
duction of my proofs In support of this com
plaint.
"I regard the proceedings a? being silly
In the extreme," said Chief Sullivan, re
ferring to Schwartz's complaint last n'ght.
"However, as Schwartz has thrown down
the prauntlet I Intend to give him a run
for his money. If the Grand Jury takes
up the matter 1 will show Schwartz and
the rest of the pang In their true colors.
I court a thorough Investigation, and
earnestly hopÂ« that the Grand Jury will
give me a chance to expose the methods
of the whole ganp. I have been waiting
for an opportunity like the present one,
and when I tell what I know under oath
the fur will fly. I hope Schwartz and
his attorney will not get cold feet and de
prive me of tho chance to tell what I
know about the trial of the poolsellers In
the Police Court."
I accordingly demand of you an immediate
investigation of said accusation and do now
offer to furnish the most convincing; and un
assailable proofs of the absolute falsity and
malicious nature ofithe charge ; and 1 do hereby
make complaint against the said Chief of Police
and do accuse him of having willfully and ma
liciously resorted to said charge and given pub
licity to the same for the sole and only pur
pose of intimidating any and all Jurors that
may hereafter be Impaneled to try said caBe of
People vs. Schwartz, or any case slmtlar there
to, from performing their duty of voting for
the acquittal of the defendant where they con-
Bctentlously believe that such should be their
verdict.
Henry Schwartz, through his attorney,
George D. Collins, filed a complaint
against Chief of Police Sullivan yester
day with Foreman Kibbler of the Granrt

cused members of the Police Court jury
of having been Induced by corrupt Influ
ence to acauit Schwnrtz on the charge
pool selling. After calling the attention
of the Grand Jury to the alleged charge
publicly made by Chief Sullivan Schwartz
says in his communication:

COAST NEWS IN BRIEF.
Judge Cabanlss. gave his decision yes
terday on the charge against W. D. Val
entine and others of running a lottery at
43 Ellis street. The Judge decided that
the charge could not be sustained, as it
had been laid down that to constitute a
lottery there must be a distribution
among several persons and a plurality of
persons Interested In the scheme. In Val
entine's case there were only the pur
chaser and the seller. Valentine and his
co-defendants were convicted last week
of running a game of chance, and the case
is on appeal.
Did Not Bon a Lottery.
An amendment to the charter submitted to
the people of this city prior to January 8, 1903
(two years from the date the charter went
into effect), would not be free from question
as to the validity of Us adoption. I do not
mean to assert that the submission of an
amendment prior to 1952 would unquestionably
be declared invalid by the courts, but it la
my oDir.lon that the earliest period at which
It can now be .said such submission would
certainly be sustained Is that Indicated above.
The language of the constitution evidences
a belief that charters adopted thereunder will
be carefully worded and not likely to need
freruent amendment. , and that It Is for the
best Interests of communities that their or
ganic laws should be stable In character and
not readily disturbed. In this belief three re
strictions were placed upon the power of
amendment, namely: That such power should
not be exercised" oftener than once
In two years; that it should . re
quire at lea*t a three-fifths vote to adopt an
amendment and that tha Legislature should
ratify such amendment before it could take
effect. .
In response to a request for an opinion
as to the earliest day on which amend
ments to trie charter may be submitted
to the people City Attorney I^ane has ad
vised the Board of Supervisors as follows:
SUBMITS AN OPINION ON
>V CHARTER AMENDMENTS
City Should Now Be Using
* Telephone Company's
Conduits.
Fire Alarm Superintendent Has Urged
That It Do Soâ Final Payments
Made on the Hall of
Justice.
The attention of the Board of Supervis
ors was called yesterday to the fact that
though the city Is entitled to use ona of
the ducts in the conduit system of the
Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Com
pany it has never availed Itself of, the*
privilege. In explaining the case Reed took
occasion to say that notwithstanding tho
clean wording of the ordinance under
which the franchise was granted to tha
company Fire Alarm Superintendent
Hewitt had persistently appeared before
the board and its various committees and
urged that municipal funds be appropri
ated to place the city's wires under
ground.
"It Is a fact." nald Reed, "that larga
sums have already been expended to place
some of the city's wires underground, al
though the telephone company, which has
constructed thirty miles of underground
conduits in the business section, acknowl
edges that It has one of Its ducts to placa
at the disposal of the municipality. Thn
city has gone to the expense of building
fifteen miles of underground conduit9 and
this year the sum of 150.000 has been set
aside for maintenance and repair of the
fire alarm system. I request that Mr.
Hewitt be cited to appear before the
Committee on Public Utilities on Tuesday
evening and explain why the property of;
the city In the telephone company's un
derground system la not being used,"
Reed quoted the following extract from
order 21S6. passed March 3. 1S90. granting
underground privileges to the Pacific Tel
ephone and Telegraph Company for a
term of fifty years:
Section B. All rlgrht9 and privileges rrantrt
by this order to the Pacific Telephone and Tele
graph Company or Its assigns shall btÂ» upon
the following conditions:
That thÂ« city and county of San IPrandseo
shall, during the term thereof, havÂ« the use
without any expense to said city Â¦ and county
of one continuous duct through the entire
length of all the conduits laid by said company
or Its assigns for tha exclusive use of the fire
alarm, fire patrol and police alarm service.
Reed's request that Hewitt bÂ« directed
to be present at to-night's meeting of the
committee was productive of an order to
that effect.
The Clerk of the Board of Supervisors
was authorized to turn over to the Board
of Public Works all contracts, plans,
specifications, reports and other data re
lating to the Hall of Justice.
Final payments on the Hall of Justice
were ordered by adoption of a resolution
that an expenditure of 113,070 60 be au
thorized to be made out of tho public
building fund In payment to the Pacific
Surety Company.

Board Passes the Ordinance Granting
Company a Franchise to Operate
Steam Road on Illinois
Street
The ordinance granting the San Fran
cisco and San Joaquln Valley Railroad
Company the right to operate a steam
road on Illinois street, from Fourth street
across Islais Creek to First avenue South,
was finally passed by the Supervisors yes
terday by unanimous vote. Acting Mayor
Tobin departed from his usual custom of
not voting on measures unless absolutely
necessary by adding his vote in favor of
the franchise. The railroad company is
thus enabled to tap the industrial sec
tions of the city and bid for the immense
freight traffic, over which the Southern
Pacific* Company has exercised an uninter
rupted monopoly for years. There was
no discussion over the ordinance, the de
tails of which have been heretofore pub
lished. The members of the board during
the long discussions in committee and be
fore the full board- freely expressed their
opinions that the franchise will be of in
estimable benefit to the community and
largely add to the city's commercial in
terests.
McCarthy submitted a resolution, which
was adopted, providing that the Board of
Supervisors recommends that the State
i Board of Harbor Commissioners and the
acting Mayor enter into an agreement
with the San Francisco and San.Joaquin
Valley Railroad Company leasing to said
company China Basin, and that tne
changes suggested to the proposed lease
be referred to the acting Mayor for his
consideration. â, j\ A .
The changes, as outlined by McCarthy
after the meeting, include the substitution
of the word "north" for "south in the
clause In the proposed lease which pro
vides that the two hundred-foot strip
around China Basin shall revert to the
city when the State has built 5000 feet ad
joining to the south of the channel.
The clause will then be made to read, ' to
3000 feet on the north side of the channel.
Again the lease is so worded that after
the State Board of Harbor Commissioners
has built wharves or piers the public shall
have free access to them and the collec
tion of tolls is placed absolutely in the
hands of the State collectors. McCarthy
says that the company's representatives
have expressed themselves as being in fa
vor of the proposed amendments to the
lease and the work of improvement will
be prosecuted vigorously under its terms.
McCarthy also submitted a resolution
requesting the Board of Public Works not
to send surveying parties to Investigate
propositions to supply this city and county
with water until further notice from the
Board of Supervisors.
Reed wanted the resolution referred to
the Public Utilities Committee, and as Mc-
Carthy Interposed no objection, It was so
ordered. McCarthy explained that the
legal status of the proposition
should be looked'" into before any
expenditures were made . by the city.
Braunhart said he was opposed to spend
ing any money for an investigation, as
there was already a report on file on Lake
Tahoe. which had been made by Colonel
Mendell In 1875. Braunhart â¢ held
that the people having water to
sell should prove their legal title
and prepare necessary surveys. Reed
said the property could only be ac
quired by condemnation. Valuable rights
would have to be purchased and values
could not be ascertained except by suit.
The city must first determine that it will
take the water and if the surveys should
demonstrate that the water supply wouid
cost more than contemplated the plan
could be abandoned.

"When the hearing of Frederick Han
pted's plea for a reduction of ball came up
before Judge Dunne yesterday there was
a large crowd in the courtroom. Lafe
Pence and W. D. Grady represented the
prisoner, and the first named stated to the
court how Hansted had. upon learning
that a charge existed against him, paid
his own way to this city and surrendered
to the police. Under these circumstances,
the counsel said, his client should have
his bond reduced, so that ne could while
Brt liberty further the ends of Justice. The
motion made by Attorney Pence was op-
I'osed by Assistant District Attorney John
T. Greaney, who was unwilling that the
bond be reduced until the prisoner gave
some evidence that he would assist jus
tice. Attorney Greaney suggested that
Hansted appear before tne Grand Jury
forthwith and tell what he knew, and if
he did the District Attorney's office would
not oppose his plea for a reduction of
bail.
Judge Dunne, after listening to the ar
guments on both sides, declared that he
would not take action until he had con
eulted Judge Bahrs. He thought that the
latter had some reason for fixing the
bond at such a high figure. He said that
Judge Bahrs might be In favor of reduc
ing the bond after listening to the state
ment made by counsel, but until he had
seen him he would not take aotlon.
Judge Bahrs returned from the country
yesterday, but Judge Dunne was unable
to 6ee him. He will consult with him this
morning and will probably give a decision.
John M. Chretien will be placed on trial
on September 3. He was up for arraign
ment, before Judge Dunne yesterday. Be
fore he was arraigned Judge Dunne dis
posed of his motion to quash the Indict
ment. Chretien contended that the in
dictment against - him was not founded
on the evidence presented to the Grand
Jury but through tho prejudice of that
body. To refute his contentions Grand
Jurors H. T. Glbbs (secretary), "W. T.
Kibbler. Emil Bower. Edward Loventhnl,
J. C. Lemmer, P. A. Scully. J. H. Brick
well, E. N. Fritz and F. R. Butts were
called to the stand. All testified that they
were not actuated by prejudice but fQund
a true bill against Chretien on the evi
dence. Judge Dunne then denied the mo
tion to set agide the Indictment and or
dered the arraignment of the prisoner.
Chretien pleaded not guilty . to the
charge of obtaining: money by false pre
tenses against him. His case was then
set for trial as stated.

the face, but, fortunately, no one received
serious injuries. After the fire in the stove
had been put cut the scholars were re
turned to their classrooms and order pre
vailed.
ln assisting the teachers to quiet the chil
dren, but their admonitions were not
headed until the band of little ones was
landed safely in the yard.
The Frazer family returned to Its dis
turbed couches and the neighborhood
chattered about the mystery of the night.
But the police were not satisfied: the Fra-
family, and with a vision of midnight
marauders in his eyes dashed from the
house, down Fillmore street to Fell,
across Fillmore back again to Hayes,
where he was lost to the excited eyes of
the watchers who had been aroused by
the shots. Officer Gleeson made a tour
of inspection in a neighboring lot, went
to the rear of C23 Fillmore street, found
no burglar, and with a feeling of heroism
in his breast returned to his beat.
Detective Crockett went, therefore, to
the house, was told the story, received
the pistol and went his way convinced
that no more serious harm than the shat
tering of the nerves of the neighborhood
and the repeated firing of a pistol meant
certainly made a spectacular entrance in
to Its new home and has given the fra
ternity of burglars a warning.
zer family was strangely reticent and an
other investigation- was made yesterday.
If the extravagant action of an excited,
immature boy, the screams of a woman
ad the repeated firing of a pistol m^ant
nothing: it was to be supposed that the
Frazer family would say so.
These were the unusual Incidents which
moused ar.d alrmcd the neighborhood and
trourht Policeman J. E. Uleeson to the
house. The officer heard the story of the
son. Roland, believed that he heard a
burglar movSr.g in the house. The
Ftranpene?s of their surroundings greatly
alarrK-d the family, and particularly the
son. who. according to the story of his
rrother, jumped from bed, seized a pistol
and fired two blank o.irtridges In the
house. N'ot satisfied that he had fright
ened away the phantom burglar young
Frazer rushed to a window and dis
charged his pistol Into the air.
SCEXE OF THE XIGHT MYSTERY WHICH PUZZLED THE WESTERN ADDITION^
While the officer who patrols Fillmore
ftreet had (submitted a report to Chief of
Police Sullivan. Chief of Detectives Sey
mour determined yesterday to make a
more thorough Investigation, and he de
tilled Detective- Crockett on the case.
Detective Crockett visited the house at
C2Z Fillmore street and after some diffi
culty was admitted. He heard thÂ« story
of the Inmates and is cornrlnced that no
crime was attempted or committed. The
family of a Captain Frazer moved into
the house last Thursday and on Friday
right Mrs. Krazcr. her daughter and her
eon, Roland Frazer, were in the house.
According to the story told by Mrs. Fra
zer to Detective Crockett last night, her

Application for a Writ of Habeas Cor
pus on Ground That Law Under
: Which Prisoner Is Held. Is
Unconstitutional.
NEW YORK, Au&. 13.â Judge Laeombe
Of the United Ktates court to-day refused
to sign the writ of extradition for Charle3
W, "W. Neely on account of thfe action of
Judge Wallace in granting an appeal to
the Supreme Court *h the habeas corpus
proceedings, but indicated that he did not
think Judge Wallace understood the renl
situation of the case. a*d he believed if it
v.ent to the Supreme. Court in its present
shape the application for a writ of habeas
corpus would be denied.
Â¦ A citation In the Neely case, signed by
Judsro. William S. Wallace, was filed in the
clerk's office of the United States court
to-day. The citati6n calls upon Henry L.
Burnett, United States District Attorney,
and William Henkel. United States Mar
shal, to appear before the Supreme Court
of thf United States in Washington on
September 7 next, pursuant to a citation
of April 4. in which Charles F: W. Neely
Is the appellant and Mar*hel Henkel the
appellee, to b'iow cause why the llnai or
der of the Circuit Court, the said petition
of appeal, should not be corrected and
Justice be done, ... j.. .
In refusing to sign the extradition writ
Judge Lacombe said in part:
I came here this morning to slrn an order
putting Neely In custody under an act passed
by Congress. June 6 last, providing the uov
ernnunt to make a disposition of the two suits
under *-hlch ordeis of arrest still stand against
him. I find, however, that the exceptional zeal
of the prisoner's counsel has produced a mo3t
peculiar situation, a complication that so far
an I know hns never before existed in connec
tion with extradition cases:
Judge Wallace of this court has been applies
to for a writ of habeas, corpus on the ground,
among others, that the act of June 6 is. un
constitutional. The writ of habeas corpus was
rÂ»ked In order to test the constitutionality of
the act and to restore to liberty a prisoner
alleged to be held under it. But the act of
June 6 does not apply here. No one Is re
strained of his liberty under that act. I never
issued an order authorizing his holding under
the act of June 6. Now the proceedinKs asking
a writ of habeas corpus has been refused, an
appeal taken and an order Issued by Judge
Â¦Wallace remanding; the prisoner. I do not
know upon what Information Judge Wallace
acted. Nor can I see what else can happen
to the appeal when it goes to the Supreme
Court except they will dismiss, it as - being
brought upon Insufficient prounds.'
Habeas corpus cannot be availed of under th.Â»
act until some proceedings are held under the
act. And I have been careful all along to
allow the order of arrest In the civil suit to
stand 'and not to attempt to put him under
the provisions of the new act. r
Judge Lacombe said he did not want to
sign papers dismissing the old charges
and leaving the prisoner held only on the
remaining order of Judge Wallace, and
asked Mr. I-indsay if Judge Wallace knew
that the man was not held under the act
of June 6. Mr. Undi'ay did not answer
directly; but mid he knew the prisoner
was arrested on an order issued by Judge
Lacombe. Judge Burnett by a request of
Judge Lacombe stated his posUion in the
case, saying he did not think Judge Wal
lace wag fully Informed of the prisoner's
proceedings. Mr. Lindsay â¢ said all he
wanted was an opportunity to submit this
case to the Supreme Court. In conclusion
Judge Laqombe said:
I certainly shall not take any action which
will turn over to a' foreign country or another
State, it matter* not which, a prisoner wno
Is held here under an order of arrest in a
civil or criminal action until such actions shall
have been discontinued. â¢
â¢ This position I have taken. from the begin
ning. ' I Â»hall not allow the prisoner to be
rpnianded until wl have got through with him.
I shall assent to no proposition that will take
the .prisoner out of the Jurisdiction of thla
court at the call of any tribunal on earth.
Judge Lacombe then advised Marshal
Henkel to keep the prisoner in custody
under the civil order or under Judge Wal
lace's order, as he chose, and to advise
with the District Attorney about that.
The Government was given until next
Monday to decide what further action lit
will take In ths matter.

Telephone South SO.Decision May Have . an Important Bearing on Â¦; tine Cases * off Mrs. Cordelia
Botkin, Convicted of the Poisoning . of Mrs. Dunning, and : of
Former Constable Albert Brandes of Berkeley.
Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ * .. Â¦
THE Supremo Court has again , de
cided that Albert Frederick George
VereneseneckockockhofE, otherwise
known as Albert Hoff, the murderer
of Mrs. Mary Clut?, shall have a new
trial.
It is believed that this decision will be
far-reaching. Thtrc. are now before the
court two important cases, In?Â« which
the charges to the juries were based
upon the same lines as those given
in the Durrant and Hoff: cases. Mrs.
Cordelia Botkln is under sentence
of death for murdering Mrs. . Dun
nirig by the means of poisoned candy sent
to Delaware from this city. Brandes," the
ex-constable of Berkeley, Is likewise un
der sentence of death for murdering his
daughter. Both cases are on" appeal be
fore the Supreme Court, and it is certain
that in the Brandes case the decision of
yesterday will be taken advantage of, as
Attorney Shaw is interested in both the
Brandes and the Hoff appeals. ; The Bot
kln case com^s - up for hearing in \ the
course of a day. or so in the Supreme
Court.
The conviction of: Hoff was based prin
cipally upon circumstantial evidence and
In his Instructions to tho jury Superior
Judge Cook dealt at length withthe law
of this sort' cf evidence, motive and in
sanity. An appeal was taken to the Su
premo Court. ' ~. < .
After considerable . dolay ' the ; higher
tribunal handed .down, a decision giving
HofT another trial. The reversal ; of- the
judgment and , order of Judge Cook^was
caused by the latter's instruction to ~ the
jury. The Supreme Court held that*' the

that the Jury was wrongfully instructed

Jury in the Case of Frank Woenne
Charged With Paying in Coin
Acquits Him.
Saloon-keepers and others who use
nickel-in-the-slot machines and pay in
coin will be jubilant over the decision of
a Jury In Judge Cabaniss' court yester
day, afternoon in the case* of Frank
Woenne, saloon-keeper, 1075 Market street,
charged with conducting a game of
chance. A policeman played the machine
and was paid in: coin. .
The, evidence of the policeman was di
rect, and after the. arguments of counsel
! the 'Judge charged, the jury, and explained
explicitly what, -constituted a game- of
chance. The jury retired and brought in
a verdict of ' not â¢ guilty. The jury :, was
composed Â¦ of .William Â¦, \ Cronin, , Arthur
Voight, Lyman V. Foster," J. S. Carberry,
George Roberts.' Paul Ottman, E. Sellon,
James Desmond,, J. B. Levy, - Thomas
Donegan, J. A. Meyer and F. W. Farren.
One or two of the jurors explained to the
Judge that they were not sure that the
defendant knew that money was paid at
the- bar. and gave him the benefit of the
doubt. Henry A. Thorn Worthen, who was
arrested at the same time as Woenne,
was convicted by Judge Cohlan last week
and fined.
A number of the machines which were
seized by the pclice over a year ago were

they had all taken out licenses and had

The success gained by the anti-boss
Republicans last Saturday night is not
sufficient to insure the defeat of - Kelly,
Crimmins, Herrin, Dibble and Wolfe at
the primary election. The warm battle
for the election of decent delegates to the
nominating conventions must .be fought
at the polls of the primary.
The anti-boss Republicans should not
make the mistake. of. conceding a single
Assembly district to Martin Kelly, and
Phil Crimmins. If the bosses are con
fronted with resolute and skillful opposi
tion at all points, they will not be able to
detach rounders from the Twenty-eighth
and Twenty-ninth Districts to confuse or
embarrass the resident voters of the
Fortieth and Forty-first Districts.
Politicians who visit tho Republican
State Central Committee and talk \ of
recognizing Crimmins and Kelly for tho
sake of promoting harmony in the party
should be on their guard. Kelly and
Crimmins would knife McKinley for
Bryan as readily as they knited Estee for
Budd, or Davis for Phelan. The Mint
Saloon bosses are in politics for percent
age on jobs and dividends on crime. They
cannot be trusted on any proposition. The
mere sight of a ballot box awakens in
each an uncontrollable desire to stuff it

The Fair case with its attendant contin
gent of attorneys came up before the Su
preme Court yesterday in an argument
Involving three cases, all referring to the
trust clause of the Fair -will.* They ara
all on appeal from Judge Slack's decision
breaking the trust clause.
All the Justices of the Supreme Court
were present and attorneys sufficient to
fill all the chairs and overflow on to tha
benches around the walls of the. court
room. Those active in the case during
the day were R. Y. Hayne^who spoke in,
the morning in favor of the trust clause,
and John Garber, who spoke in the after
noon against It. Each side has been lim
ited by the court to five hours, each u>
dispose of its hours as it sees fit.
Hayne's contention was that the tni3C
clause was valid because, while it might
not be. among the trusts allowed by thi
statutes of this State, it was still such ;4
trust as would be valid under the com
mon law. He contended that the common
law governed. There had been a statute,
defining "powers" of conveying land la
"ways similar to that adopted by Fair,
but that statute had been repealed, and
in repealing the statute Hayne contend
ed that the common law, upon whic.i
the statute was built, then obtained and
that under it the Fair trust was valid.
Attorney Hayse contended further' that
even if the trust clause be declared in
valid then /he words of the trust could
not be construed into a declaration of the
intention of the testator to bequeath tho
property in the manner stated in the
trust and therefore it was within tha
province of the court to direct the inheri
tance in the manner set forth, regardless
of the validity of the trust which it waa
aimed to form.
In answer Garber took up the question
of intention, advancing the idea that tho
best evidence of the intent of tho
testator was the words he used l;i
his will. There . could be no doubi
of the fact that he had desired
to create â¢ a trust, Garber claimed, and
that trust was an invalid one. The right
â¢ of bequeathing property was not an in
herent right, the lawyer argued, but a
privilege allowed by law. Therefore,
when a man wished to bequeath his prop
erty in any other way than according to
the law's doctrine of the descent of prop
erty, he must do so Â»n' the manner pre
scribed by law or his bequests could not
be considered.
Judge Garber contended that trusts
were limited by the Legislature of . this
State to certain kinds and a trust to con
vey was not among those set forth. He
continued in an effort to demonstrate
that the Fair trust was a trust to convey.
The trust was formed by the will to las: \
through the lives of the first generation i
after Fair, and it wa3 directed that thvx
the trustees must convey the property >
to the second generation, the grandchil
dren of Fair. Thi3. Garber argued was
a trust to convey to the grandchildren of
Fair and as such was Invalid under tha
laws of this State.
On the other points advanced by Hayna
Garber will touch more fully this morn
ing and then McEnerney will reply
The doctrine of trusts involves soma of
the most intricate points that lawyers
can bring into court.. There have be^n
volumes upon volumes written upon tha
subject and the arguments are inter
spersed with quotations from all the legal
V^. 9 , fr0 , m Kln * A1 & ed to th Â« last book
of California reports. They were just such
points as lawyers like to listen to and ko
to sleep over and they will be argued for
nearly sis hours more. â^ b
