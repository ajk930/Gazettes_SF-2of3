the prosecution of military ; opera

vited by the powers, but was made
by the Viceroy In the course of a
conversation he hÂ»d wlth_the for
eign Consuls at Shanghai." Though
no formal communication has been .
made to the Chinese Government
by any power on the subject of an
Indemnity. LI Huns Chang and
the Peking 1 authorities thoroughly
understand thiit the powers will de
mand monetary reparation for the
Â¦ damage done foreign property, and
j the military expenses they have In
curred.
United States and other powers it does not necessarily follow
that this Government and others must declare war on her.
Minister Conger's statement that it would be certain death
for the Ministers to leave Peking confirms the belief of mem
bers of the Cabinet.
The dispatch no longer leaves any question as to the atti-.
tude of the Chinese Government. Imperial trops are openly
firing upon the legations. There is evidently no attempt on the
part of the Chinese authorities- to keep up the fiction that the
Ministers are being attacked by the insurgents, Further; than
this, the Minister is evidently firmly convinced that the; imperial
Government, in wishing to have the inmates of the legation start
from Peking, is plotting to have them murdered on the way to
Tientsin.
1A/ILL SPUR ON POWERS.
This dispatch will serve to spur the powers onwafd'to
more determined efforts to reach Peking .without The
message just as it was received from Minister Conger will be
communicated to all. the powers; to-morrow and copies will be
cabled to Rear Admiral Remey and Major General Gha'ffe*
While some members of the Cabinet desire a declaration of
war, at least one of the parties to the conference to-night frowns
upon the suggestion. He said that he did not see how the
Conger message changed the situation in the slightest degree.
Of course proof of the duplicity of the Chinese Government is
furnished, but because the Chinese are making war upon the
The President will sleep on the Conger dispatch to-night,
and to-morrow he is expected to communicate his views to the
State Department, when any changes in the policy of the ad
ministration will be put into effect.
DUPLICITY IS PROVED.
It has been stated time and again by high officials of the
administration that this Government will be the last to declare
war on China, and. notwithstanding the indubitable evidence
now to hand of the trickery which the Chinese Government con
templated in order to lure foreign representatives to their death
no action has been taken looking to such a declaration.
At the same time the question of policy necessarily must be
considered, and as there is nothing to be gained by a formal
declaration, but instead the precipitation of additional compli
cations, it is unlikely that the President will adopt such a course.
For more than two hours these officials discussed the sit
uation with the President, and just before Secretary Foot
ended the interview Adjutant General Corbin, who had been
summoned, arrived to discuss the military aspect of the situa
tion with the Secretary of War and through him with the Presi
dent. Some of the President's counselors are strongly in favor
of calling Congress together for the purpose of making a for
mal declaration of- war. Those officials have come to the con
clusion that they have ample ground for such action in case it is
deemed advisable.
The dispatch from Minister Conger was immediately tele
phoned to the President. There was some talk between the
President and Colonel Montgomery, who telephoned for Mr.
Adee regarding the international phase of the Conger dis
patch, and when Secretary Root arrived the President talked
with him as to the effect of the dispatch both upon this country
and upon other powers.
WOULD DECLARE WAR.
Although the authorities have had ever}' reason to believe
the Chinese Government was responsible for the condition of af
fairs in Peking, it has tacitly accepted the polite fiction that a
mob was in control and the imperial authorities were unable to
regain control. Minister Conger's latest dispatch dissipates
any such belief. He speaks of "the Chinese. Government in
sisting upon our leaving Peking, which would be certain
death," and then of "rifle firing upon us daily by imperial
troops." Taken with the previous information received by the
authorities, there can no longer be any doubt that the Chinese
Government is responsible for the existing disorders. It is
stated with emphasis to-night that the President purposes to
hold that Government to strict accountability for events in Pe
king.
BUREAU, WELLINGTON HOTEL, WASH
l j INGTON, Aug. 7. â Not only are the imperial troops
again attacking the foreign Ministers in Peking, but the
Chinese Government seems to be actually conniving to bring
about their assassination. These facts were presented in the
cipher dispatch received by the State Department this after
noon from Minister Conger and made public late to-night. The
message was promptly telephoned to the President. While no
action has been taken, it is stated on good authority that the
United States is nearer declaring war on China at this moment
than it has been since the Ministers were cut off from commu
nication.

CALL BUREAU. WELLINGTON
HOTEL, WASHINGTON, Aug. 7.â
General Chaffee's dispatch to tha
Secretary of War. although writte-i
two days before the battle at Pci
tfangr. throws much light on the conflict.
It fhowf that the scouts of the interna
tional column had obtained a fairly de
tailed knowledge of the country over
which the operations were to extend, and
that they knew the locality of the Chi
nese troops, their gtrength and character
of their defense. The dispatch Is regard
ed as a refutation of the reports of dis
cord among the commanders of the inter
national forces, as It shows that they
were able to agree upon a plan of battle
Jn which the part rach command was to
play was agreed upon in advance. It is
true that there Js no mention In the dis
patch of the Germans, but it is thought
that this is probably due to the fact that
the German force is small and that it
probably did not participate in the ad
vance, possibly being: left behind to aid
the Sixth United States Cavalry In guard
ing the city nf Tientsin.
According to General Chaffee's dispatch
the American? had about 2150 men In the
battle. The 2^K) he mentions were in
fantry, made up of the Ninth and Four
u-er.th regiments and a marine detach
ment. In addition to these he had the
light battery of the Fifth Artillery, known
rs Reilly'5 Battery, from its captain,
Henry J. Reilly. This battery is equipped
wiih six three and two ten-inch field
pieces and probably Trent into the fight

Operating on Chinese Soil.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ALL BUREAU, WELLINGTON HOTEL V WASHINGTON, Aug. 7.â Word has been received that Japan
reinforced her troops in China by 3OOO infantry and one battery of siege artillery. These
will bring her army up to a total of more than 25,000 men and make it the strongest of any power in
China. The allied forces on Chinese soil, when the additional Japanese troops and the troops of other powers
arrive, will number 100,000 men.
So far from any objection being made by any government to Japan's increase of her military strength.
in China, the powers rather welcome it. The stout resistance the Chinese are making furnishes good grounds
for sending such a force to China that the Celestial troops will be unable to stop their advance. European
nations agree with the "United States that the defeat of the allies by the Chinese would do incalculable harm
and are as anxious that the troops shall capture Peking without reverse as this Government is.
Major Byron, chief quartermaster on General Chaffee's staff, has wired to Colonel Miller, chief quar
termaster at Manila, that he has plenty of lighters and is getting supplies ashore at Taku, but he needs mors
tugs to move the lighters about the harbor. Colonel Miller has sent several tugs to Taku and others will
be hastened there. !

ENGLAND HAS GIVEN
'CHINA DUE WARNING
should take no step to endanger the lives
of the Ministers.
A message from the Belgian Minister,
dated Peking August 2. seems effectually
to dispose of the rumors that the Min
isters have either left or are intending
to leave Peking.
The Chinese Minister in London, Sir
Chin Chin Lo Fens I-uh. says he has
received a telesjram from China announc
ing that a long imperial edict was issued
on August 2. authorizing the immediate
and safe conveyance of all Europeans in
Peklnp to Tientsin.
Several dispatches are printed giving
hearsay accounts of Sunday's battle. The
Daily Mail's correspondent at Chefu, tele
graphing Monday, says:
"The fighting lasted seven hours and
the nllies, when my report left, were pur
sing the Chinese: but owing to the floods
progress was difficult. Thus the Chinese
will have to reform and to recover from
the effects of battle. Only a small gar
ripon. with fourteen guns, remains at
Tientsin, where some anxiety is felt be
cause of a report that 13,000 Chinese are
said to be moving two days' march to
the southeast."
All the correspondents asrree in praising
the bravery and organization of the Jap
anese, but none of them brlnprs the story
much beyond General Chaffee's report.
Li Ping Heng. according to the Shang
hai correspondent of the Standard, has
been appointed generalissimo of the Chi
nese forces and has left Peking to com
mand the troops outside the city.
A' Shanghai special says that official ad
vices from Tuklo announce that armed
collisions have occurred between parties
of Russians and Japanese outside Taku.
This, however, as it comes by way of
Shanghai, must await confirmation before
beinp credited.
The Shanghai correspondent of the Dal
ly Mail, confirming the matsacre of'mls
sionaries at Chuchowfu. skys that two
American women were among the vic
tims.
The Sevastopol correspondent of the
Daily Graphic asserts that the Russian
Government will send 125,000 additional
troops from Odessa to the Far East be
fore the end of the year.
Berlin dispatches say it Is rumored
there that an agreement has been reach
ed between Emperor Nicholas and Em
peror William whereby " German troops
will be permitted to proceed to China by
way of Siberia.
The royal arsenal at Woolwich has
been ordered to send thirty million rounds
of smallarm ammunition to China.
LONDON, Aug. 9, 4=35
a. m. â "In case the troops
advance the Chinese must
fight. The suggestion that the
allies will be allowed to enter Pe
king in order to escort the Min
isters to Tientsin is absolutely
impossible."
This is the dictum of Li
Hung Chang. It was transmitted
last evening to William Pritch
ard Morgan, member of Parlia
ment for Merthyr Tydvil, by his
agent at Shanghai. The agent
had carried to Earl Li a message
from Mr. Morgan urging that
the allied troops be allowed to
enter the capital, and stating that
a settlement could /be made at
Tientsin wjiereby a war of the
world against China could be
averted; but even the optimistic
Li failed to hold out the slightest
hope of its feasibility, although
he reiterated to Mr. Morgan's
agent his declaration that the
Ministers had left Peking, fixing
the date of their departure as Au
gust 2. The ag-ent makes this
comment: "The Consuls arc
without confirmation."
These messages 1 have been sent to I^ord

"CHINESE MUST FIGHT THE ALLIES IF THEY ADVANCE"
THE SAN FKAXCISCO GALL, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 8, 1900.
"All foreigners are at the British legation, where we have been besieged by
Chinese troops since June 20. Up to the present fifty-eight marines have been
killed and seventy wounded. 1 v'
"The attack has ceased since July 17. Provisions are almost exhausted. TTo
hope to be delivered next week. Â¦ All the Belgians here are well."
BRUSSELS, Aug. 7.â M. de Favereau, Minister of Foreign Affairs has re
ceived the following message from the Belgian Minister in Peking:
â¢â¢PEKING, Aug. 2.â We succeeded in defending our legation from June 4 to
June 16, but with the aid of eight Austrian marines were unable to save it. The
Austrian, Dutch and Italian legations were all burned and the French legation is
In ruins.
It is not impossible that Minister Wu may be told in plain
language to-morrow that if his Government persists in its pres
ent course it can hope for no mercy, and that every one in any
degree responsible for the outrage upon the ' Ministers, even
though it be the occupant of the throne, will be held to a strict
accountability. The same message may be communicated
through the Consuls in China to the various Viceroys, and es
pecially through Consul General Goodwin, to Li Hung Chang,
in the hepe that through some channel ihe warning of the wrath
of civilization may be carried to the supreme power at Pekin^
and the lives of the inmates of the legations saved.

THE STORY OF
BLACKMAILING
How He Came to Give Notes
for Large Sums to the
Slovinskis.
Sketches in l>etail the Sensational
Scene in the Parlor of
His Home at Los
Angeles.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 7.â The prelimi
nary examination of John Slovinski and
wife on a charge of attempting to levy
$15,000 blackmail on Capitalist A. R.
Maines of this city was begun before Jus
tice Austin this morning. Maines, who
was the principal witness, was called and
told of his experience with the Jealous
husband on July 20 last.-
Maines said that he first met Mrs. Slo
vlr.skl while she was stopping at the Gar
vanza Hotel about the middle of last
February, this year. I He saw her but a
few times, as the hotel closed soon after
this and all the guests left. He next saw
her and met her husband for the first
time at the Sea Beach Hotel at Catalina
I July 8. He was at the island on a busi-
I ness trip and saw Mrs. Slovinski on the
plazzl. He had afterward gone into the
hotel and there Mrs. Slovinski had In
i troduced him to her husband. There was
some general conversation for five or ten
minutes and he had left. Later Mrs. Slo
vinski had met him near the bathhouses
and warned him csainst her husband,
telling him not to see her again or speak
I to her, 39 her husband was jealous and
I had made threats to kill him.
The next time he saw the couple was
July 13. when they called at his home on
Broadway. Here Slovinski said to Maines:
"You have rulr.rd my life and disgraced
my child. I've left my wife penniless on
the island and will never go back to her
or see her again."
Maines said that he denied the charge,
when Slovinski' produced a letter and
asked him why. if he had not been frlend
lv with his wife, he had written It.
Maines said that he did not take the let
ter nor pay any attention to It. for the
reason that Slovinski had told him that
It was a copy of the original, which he
intended to have lithographed and sent
broadcast over the country, to his wife's
rel3tl% - es and those of Maines. \
The next time he paw the Slovinskls,
Maines said, was on the morning of July
20, between S and 9 o'clock, when the
couple walked into his store on Spring
street together and Slovinski said that he
had come to have that letter explained.
Maines told the two that his wife was
away from home, so they adjourned to
his home on South Broadway. On en
tering the house Maines went to the win
dow to raise a curtain, leaving Slovinski
and his wife sitting in chairs near the
folding doors. As he turned toward the
two Slovinski was pointing a revolver at
him. The husband said: "My wife has
confessed everything and I have deter
mined to kill you."
"His hand was shaking so, I was afraid
that the thing might go off unintention
ally," said Maines. "but I told him that
if he -was determined to kill mo, and I
knew he could, there was only one request
that I had to make, and that was for him
to go to the telephone and call up my
wife, that I may say goodby."
" TCo. you don't catch me that way,'
roared Slovinski," continued Maines,
"and then he bogan stamping on the floor,
calling out, 'Confess it, confess it. My
wife has confessed everything. Sit down
or I will kill you -where you stand.' "
Maines said that he thought that It was
time to sit down and did so, and 'then Mrs.
Slovinski fell upon her knees, betting
him to confess, paying that her husband
would kill him if .he did not. She said
that he must not think that she had any
thing to do with this, as her husband had
made her do it. Slovinski, Maines said,
kept on accusing him and he had finally
replied: " 'Well, I suppose your wife has
told the truth." and that is all the confes
sion I made. Slovinski quieted down after
this somewhat, remarking: *Now w there is
Just thla much about it. You must give
me a deed to the Garvanza Hotel and
JjiiOO in cash or your life.' Thinking to
gain time I replied,, 'Isn't this a little ex
travagant? Won't the deed to the hotel
be enough?' But he again became vio
lent and the talk continued."
Malnes continued his testimony up to
the point where he gave the two notes for
SlO.OtX) and 55000 respectively, and then he
was withdrawn to erlve Professor Green
of Colton and Mrs. Thompson of tlie same
place a chance to tell about a quarrel be
tween the Slovlnskis at Catalina on the
night of July 11. when Slovinski beat his
wife to make her confess to relations with
Maines.
The case was then continued until to
morrow morning, when the defense say
they will bring out some startling develop
ments en cross-examination.
Bedwood's Era of Improvement.
REDWOOD CITY, Aug. 7.â The Board
of Trustees of this place are planning ex
tensive improvements between now and
the rainy season. About J?OÂ» will be
spent In purchasing and laying new wa
ter mains and many of the streets will be
macadamized. Cement sidewalks will be
ordered on a number of the main thor
oughfares. The board held a meeting to
night at which the various improvements
to be made were discussed. In the mac
adamizing of the streets It Is the de
sire of the board to have the propÂ«"Â«ty
holders do the work voluntarily, without
the necessity of resorting to the Vrooman
act. Already a large proportion of the
owners of property on a number of the
streets have signified a willingness to do
the work.

the State Board of Health, to thd

important documents in no way belonging

Upon rhe request of the BeÂ© for Judg
ment on the pleadings Judge Hart cald
that there was no doubt in his rnlnd that
the reports referred to aro public records
and that the proper place for them Is with
the State Beard of Health.
Mr. Pest interposed that the Governor

Ju<?Â£e Hart, "where the Governor has any
authority fcr conducting such an Investi

Mr. Post said that the Governor has the
supervision of the oQdal conduct of all

WOMAN'S BODY
ADRIFT NEAR
WALDO POINT
SANTA CRUZ. Aug. 7.â Arnos K.
Ziegler, residing at Doyle Gulch,
seven miles from this city, last
night murdered his wife by cut
ting her throat ar.d then at
tempted suicide by slashing at his own
throat, and though he made several ugly
gashes he failed in his intentions. He is
now In the County Jail.
The terrible tragedy occurred at mid
night, and was tho outcome of an un
happy marriage and domestic Infelicity.
There were no witnesses to the deed; no
one save Ziegler can tell of the woman s
frantic struggles in the road in front of
her home, when her blood-lusting husband
overtook the fleeing woman and did his
murderous work; and when her brother
in-law, who resided in the same house,
rushed out In response to her cries, he
met the murderer with his hands red with |
his victim's blood. Asking Ziegler where
his sister-in-law was. he received tho re
ply:
"She will never come back. You need
not call the officers, as I am going to cut
my throat."
First News of the Crime,
It was 12:30 this morning that Sheriff
Besse was aroused at his home in this
city by Attorney \V. B. Sharp of San
Francisco, a brother of Mrs. Ziegler. ar.d
informed of the tragedy in Doyle Gulch.
With Deputy Sherifta Mullen and Alzina
and Coroner Morgan the Sheriff drove out
to Doyle Gulch. As they neared the Zieg
ler home one of the horses, snorting with
fear, sharply swerved to one side. One
of the Sheriffs men got out of the con
veyance, and lighting a match beheld the
bodv of the woman, face downward, the
head almost severed from the body. In the
middle of the road. Her clothing was
drenched with blood and the dust in th<?
road was red. There Â¦were no signs of a
strupglr* there, and the woman had evi
dently never moved after falling.
The Sheriff's men covered the body with
a cloth and went to the farmhouse. On
the kitchen porch they saw a recumbent
form. It was Ziegler, with a slash across
his throat. He was breathing hard and
was conscious, but would not reply to tho
questions put to him. Coroner Morgan,
on examining the wound, found it extend
ed from ear to ear. but was not deop
enough to be dangerous. The doctor
dressed the wound and Ziegler was
covered with blankets. His hands were
still red. ar.d under his body the officers
found the butcher-knife with which he
had committed the murder. It had the
appearance of having been recently well
ground.
Ziegler was brought to the County Jail
thl= morning and the body of the mur
dered woman was taken to an under
taker's establishment. An examination
of the body showed the viclousness of
Zlegler*s attack. He had slashed at htp
victim four or five times before the last
terrible stroke that almost severed the
head. Her hands were also cut and
slashed, showing that she had tried to
ward off the murderer's weapon.
Confession.
This 1s t!Â»e confession of crime mad*
by ZlesrJer. lying on a cot in the County
Jail thfs afternoon, in response to the re
quest of The Call's correspondent:.
"Ws; I killed my wife.
"Ten months ago she -was sent to San
FVancisco to be treated for nervous trou
bles. Since then she has not treated me
right. She appeared as if she hated me
and quarreled all the time. We quarreled
last night. It was the same old story of
bickerings ar.d upbraidings. The quarrel
started about a dog. She wanted the dog
; tied up. I a^kc-d her why she did not tell
i me before dark, and one thing led on to
' another and finally she got mad.
"My brother-in-law. Mr. Sharp, was In
' the room with us and wo were drinking
Zk-gler formerly lived at Challls, Idaho,
where he was a Justice of the Peace. He
was hi years old. His wife was only 32
years old and was frail and in ill health.
They had been married six years.
"Down the road. She is O. K. She
packed her basket and left, but she
fought like a wildcat. I have done
the deed and have the same knife to
cut my jugular vein."
William Beverly Sharp of San Fran
cisco, a brother-in-law of Mrs. Zlejrler.
was visiting his two sons, who with their
irrandmother had been at Zlogler's home
two years, told of the quarrel between
the couple last night. He said that they
finally seemed to have adjusted the
trouble and so he retired for the night.
After a few minutes Mrs. Ziegler came

telescope basket. After he had been
p.s'.eep for some time Mrs. Armstrong
av.akened him and told him that some
thing terrible was happening down the
road. About that time he heard muftlea
Â«preamÂ«. lie dressed and went down
stairs. He m^t Ziegler, who carao In pant
ing, and asked him. "Where is Cad?"
Ziegler replied:
In answer to the question as to the
cause of their estrangement Ziegler had
answered, "Infidelity."
Mrs Evelyn Armstrong, mother of Mrs.
Ziegler. said h<?r daughter was 32 years
old and a native of Marin County.
Late this afternoon at the Coroner s in
quest Ziegler rgain told of his crime In
a cool and deliberate manner. After nar
rating, pubstantlally. the stcry he had
told earlier to The Call's correspondent,
he continued:
"I followed my wife out into the road.
When she struck me I got angry. I
stabbed her In the throat. She threw up
her hands to protect herself as I struck
at hor again. She fell in the road and I
walked away. I had gone only a short
distance, when I heard her scream.
"Then I decided to put her out of her
misery- I returned and cut her throat.
Then I went to the house and tried to kill
mypelf." . i.
Sheriff Be?se testified that Ziegler had
told him after his arrest that he had
killed his wife. She had had no affection
for him.
Relates His Deed to the Coroner.
"I had been preparing for the ending- of
the trouble. A couple of days before the
quarrel 1 had secured the knife. I sharp
ened it and put it away where I could
readily get it. I did this because my wife
had taken my revolver. Six months ago
1 had beon expecting that/I would do
this and it was then that r cleaned and
loaded my revolver, prepared to use it at
the proper time. She found the pistol,
however, while rummaging about the
barn. , , .
â¢'I loved her, but she wouldn't have any
thing to do with me. Before she went
to San Francisco she was always good
and we werÂ« happy. She has never look
ed at me except with a black scowl and
was never pleasant.
"1 am sorry I didn't do a good Job. The
knife was too dull or it hurt too Dad. I
drank lots of whisky, thinking it might
give me more nerve, but It didn't anect
me."
"I then told her I would pay her
back for the treatment she had given
me during the past ten months.
beer. After Mr. Sharp went to bed my
wife went into another room and com
menced packing a basket. She said she
was going to leave my home. She walked
out of the room. I tried to head her off
and coaxed and pleaded with her to stay.
We were out in the road by this time.
She said if I did not stop she would hit
me with a rock. Finally she struck me a
hard blow in the face with her hand.
Amos K. Ziegler, a rancher, living in Doyles Gulch, seven miles

of his home, when she attempted to leave the house because of a quar
rel. He stabbed her with, a butcher knife, and when she fell ha cut her
throat, to "put her out of her misery," as he confessed yesterday. He

SLAYS HIS WIFE
ON A ROAD AT NIGHT
FRESNO, Aug. 7.â If there was any
doubt about the deliberate nature
of the crime committed by 13-year
ojd Fred Himes and his youthful
abettor, who poisoned their fath
er, it was removed to-day by two confes
sions, one by Frankie Himes, the 9-year
old brother of the poisoner, and the other
by Elmer Martin, his 10-year-old cousin.
Both the boys were fully cognizant of
the plot for several days preceding Its
execution, and their stories of the awful
crime show that Fred Himes, who was
supposed to have made a full confession,
told the officers cunning lies in order to
shield himself.
Tho statements of the boys were ob
tained by Deputy District Attorney
Church to-day after Deputy Sheriff John
White had arrested Elmer Martin for
complicity in the plot. Frankie Himes
had been in Jail for two or three days,
but the officers wanted them both before
they took a statement from either.
Frankie was the flrst examined. He
said he knew of the plot for about four
days before the fatal attempt was made.
His brother first tried to kill tho senior
Himes by giving him a potion made by
boiling weeds which he had heard were
poisonous.
"It never phased him," vttlb the
â¢way the tot explained the effect of.
the drug on his father.
This attempt proving unsuccessful, the
older brother thought of the "Rough on
Katp." The brothers stole bottles and
sacks and sold them until they had ac
cumulated a fund to purchase the poison.
On the morning following the first dose,
while the father was writhing In agony,
Fred prepared a cup of pepper tea for
the sick man ar.d added a teaspoonful of
the ratsbane In the presence of his
brother.
"If the other dose' did not fix him,"
said he, as he emptied the powder
into the pot, "by , this will."
Frankie denied that his father had been
cruel to Fred. He said his brother never
complained of Ill-treatment until after he
had administered the poison. He wanted
his father's team and thought poison was
the only way of getting it. The little fel
low says he ftdvtsed his brother not to do
It. but that the latter wouldn't listen to
him. His story is a point-blank contradic
tion of Fred's. The latter tried to make
it appear that he gave his father the
poison only once, and that he was driven
DEVASTATION BY FIRE
IN YELLOWSTONE PARK
Worst Conflagration Ever Known in
That Begion Is Sweeping the
Timber Belt.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BUTTE, Mont.. Aug. 7.â Deputy United
States Marshal Sam Jackson. Just In from
Mammoth Hot Springs, reports a destruc
tive forest nre that is sweeping the tim
bered area between the Upper Geyser Ba
sin and the lake in the Yellowstone Na
tional Park. The flro started Friday and
was soon beyond the control of the sol
diers and roail crews, all of whom were
hurried to the scene. The buildings at
the Upper Geyser Basin are in danger.
The line of tiro is ten miles long ana is
spreading rapidly. It is not known how
the fire started, but it is presumed to have
been the work of some careless camper.
Jackson .said to-day:
It would take all the men in Montana and
Wyoming to put out the nre. When I left it
was said that the fire line extended for ten
miles and was undoubtedly spreading. The
timber in that region Is dense and the trees
are of pretty pood size. It is unusually dry
and the wind fairly sweeps thÂ« (lames through
the tops of the big pines. The timber on th<j
continental divide Is heavier than in most sec
tions of the park, and the fear is expressed that
the fire will sweep through a gTeat portion of
it. The buildings at the Upper Geyser Basin
were in danger from. the fire. If the fire is not
checked before it reaches the timber surround
ing the b3sln the buildings will surely be
burned. The big hotel, near Old Faithful Gey
ser, was burned several years ago, but there
are a /lumber of bulldlntcs there still. DensÂ»
clouds of smoke hang over that part of the
park. Everything Is being done that can be
done but men are powerless before such a fire
as this The deer and elk were running out of
the threatened districts. No one knows the ex
tent of the fire, but it is the worst one ever
known in this reclon.
Mr Jackson said that Banker Piper of
St. Marys, Ohio, who strayed from the
Fountain Hotel one week from to-day,
has not been found. A number of sol
diers had been searching for him, but
when the fire broke out between the lake
and the Upper Geyser Basin all of the
soldiers were called In and sent to that
I place.

When Fred was first arrested and made
hi3 confession a good many pitied him.
supposing that his stories of Inhuman
treatment at the hands of his father were
true and that he administered the poison
in a tit of desperation. The two confes
sions received to-day throw a different
light on the crime.
Himes will probably die before morning.
He sank rapidly to-day and is breathing
heavily. Dr. Davidson says his death Is
only a Question of hours.
Martin says he saw the first and second
doses of poison administered. He then
got scarce!, and after advlslns Fred not
to give his father any more of the stuff,
he ran away. The boy corroborated
Frankie regarding Illraes treatment of
his eldest son, which he said was not
cruel.
Martin was to pay Fred $73 for a half
interest on the outfit and had $15 ready to
turn over when Himes died. Fred was to
live with Martin and his parents, and as
compensation for his board was to bring
with him the household furniture. They
were to do teaming and Job work gener
ally, and share the profits equally.
Elmer Martin declares that he
knew of the plot from the first. He
and Fred Himes wanted to get the
latter's father out of the way so that
they could go into partnership with,
the wagon and horses as capital.
to desperation by the parent's ill-treat
ment of him.
The shocking story of moral depravity revealed by the confession
of the Fresno boy, Frederich Himes, who poisoned his father because,
as he alleged, the latter mistreat3d him, is augmented by the confessions
of the boy's accomplices â his younger brother Frankie and his 10-year
old cousin, Elmer Martin. They yesterday told a Deputy Sheriff how the
plot had been laid to poison the senior Himes, not because he ill-treated
Fred, but because they wanted to secure his wagon and horses and go
into the teaming business. They told also of the heartless manner in
which they planned the father's removal. Ths story is almost without
parallel in criminal history.

Monterey Bay's Unknown Dead.
SALINAS, Aug. 7.â Monterey Bay ha3
again given up the body of an unknown
man and there Is much conjecture here
to-night as to whether the man was
murdered, committed suicide or was ac
cidentally drowned.
The body, badly decomposed, was
washed upon the beach near Moss
ing, a few miles from here, to-day. It
was found by lishermen. The head was
badly mutilated, while both hands and
forearms were gone. The man must have
b?en about five feet ten Inches tall and
wquld weigh between 160 and ISO pounds.
The remains were clad In a blue flannel
shirt, brogans and home-knit gray socks.
An Inquest was held and the verdict of
the Coroner's jury was to the effect that
"a person unknown came to his death
from unknown causes."

ADIEU TO THEIR
TWO CHAMPIONS
Wish W. D. Mansfield and

Are to Compete in the World's
Tournament at Chicago as
Representatives of the
Local Club.
?
The members of San Francisco Flycast
ing Club met last night at the banquet
board to wish godspeed to Walter D.
Mansfield and A. E. Lovett, who will rep
resent them in the open to the world tour
nament at Chicago. This will bo held on
the 17th and 18th lnst., and will attract
the most expert rod wielders throughout
America.
Three years ago Mr. Mansfield attended
a similar tournament and swept every
thing before him, proving the most expert
of all those in attendance and winning the
titlf of world's champion. Since then the
Eastern men have practiced the art of
competitive flycasting assiduously, re
ceiving most of their education from the
enthusiasts on this coast. As a sequence
they are equaling in practice the beat per
formances of the local men, and the out
come of the tournament is problematic at
the present time. There is no method of
comparison which can be applied, hence
only the test of competition can determine
whether the repressntatlves of this coast
can hold their own with the men who will
come out of the East.
The trophy offered by the San Francisco
Flycasting Club to be competed for at
the Chicago tournament was exhibited at
the dinner. Tt Is a beautiful gold match
box studded with diamonds and artistic
ally enameled with favorite files of the
anglers. It is offered for the best general
average In accuracy at fly and bait cast-
Ing. It was especially offered for competi
tion among members of the Chicago Club,
but they insisted upon its bein,; open to all
competitors. Its inscription reads:

"We do not take that exact view of the
case at this time, but we havo some ideas.
The most emphatic is that if we should
undertake to make the radical change-s
called for by the I.os Angeles business
men it would be but a matter of a short
time when we would be called down by the
Jobbers of this city and asked that there
should be another adjustment. On that
basis It would be a see-saw and there
would be no satisfaction in the situation
for anybody. The gentlemen from Los
Angeles most certainly have observed the
fact that it is all up and down hill work
from their city and that from San Fran
cisco to Bakersfield the roadbed is prac
tically level. The difference in the cost
of transportation can be readily recog
nized. Topographical conditions regulate
these matters generally, for we cannot
make level plains out of mountains. This
subject has been discussed before, but
this Is the first time the Angelenos have
come to this city to present their claims.
We can see no reason why there should
be any radical change from the existing
schedule, and I do not think there will
be."
"1 was present at the conference of the
Los Angeies business men In which they
usked lor a readjustment of the freight
rates between San Francisco and l^os
Angeles," said Assistant Traffic Manager
Bissell of the Santa fe Company yester
day. "The problem is dittlcuit, and as a
matter of fact we have not considered it
seriously up to this date. It will be given
consideration, however, and I think the
reply will be forthcoming in a few days.
At the present time 1 cannot state what
the nature of the answer will be, but 1
can see no probability of a change from
existing conditions."
"We are placed between two antagonis
tic positions," said Freight Tratnc Man
ager Sproule. "The existing tariff is
based on the lines of business not only of
the shipper but of the carrier. On the
face of the proposition it would appear
that the San Francisco jobbers were fa
vored as against those of Los Angeles,
but when the shlppeqf of the southern
city come to us and asK for a mileage pro
rata we cannot see our way clear to grant
the request. Bakersfield is the main mar
ket they havo In sight, and their plea Is
that as Los Angeles is so near to the
southern end of the San Joaquin Valley
freight rates should be so adjusted as to
give the preference to the metropolis of
the south.
The Angelenos have their eyes on the
region mentioned, and knowing that there
is a large and growing trallic In that sec
tion they are out for it. As a consequence
they have made matters very disagree
able for the men who boss the freight
trains on the two lints Â¦mentioned. The
trouble arises out of the fact that the de
mands of the business men of the south
appear to be reasonable. Tney want a pro
raia mileage arrangement, but under ex
isting conditions matters cannot be i ar
ranged to the satisfaction of the parties
The freight traffic managers of the
Southern Pacific and Santa Fe companies
are not in a happy frame of mind as a re
sult of the visit of the committee of Los

"Lucke is selling out/'
The enormous crowds attending Lucke's Shoe
Sale proves that the people know what the low
prices mean. Forty-five clerks were kept busy all
Saturday, Monday and Tuesday, and three police-
men were required to control the crowds awaiting
admission.
Lucke's are most all high-grade shoes selling
originally from $<; to $8--now these fine, stylish
goods are reduced Â£0 per cent to 100 per cent:
numbers of small sizesâ narrow widthsâ are sell-
ing as low as $oc a pair.
â¢* No exchanges wiil be .made at these prices-
shoes purchased must be kept â but every care is
taken to fit those buying shoes at $1.50 and over.

Sheriff Taylor's Posse Is Said to Be
on the TTail of the Manslayer
and His Guide.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
COVELO, Aug. 7.â Sheriff Taylor's posse
took up the trail of murderer Kins at
daylight this morning. This information
reached here this evening by one of the
posse, who withdrew owing to a slight in
jury he received by being pulled from his
horse In a thicket. The returning deputy
was unable to outline the route of the
proposed trail to-day, but it is understood
that the posses had divided. One takes
the direct trail in the wake of the fu;ji
tive, while the other posse covers the
background to intercept any doubling by
the murderer. It is feared that this has
been the oversight of the pursuing party
and that King has doubled, thus mislead
ing his pursuers. The inability to get
bloodhounds In this section has retarded
the success of the expedition.
Quite a commontloa was created late
this afternoon by a report that the posse
was now returning with the murderer and
a large number of people gathered on
the streets and awaited the arrival of a
procession of horsemen, but the caval
cade of horsemen proved to be some Gov
ernment agents with a band of horses.
Two trappers coming in from the Mad
River country to-day reported that a
white man and a half-breed Indian called
at their cabin Saturday for food. .They
were afoot and appeared greatly fatigued
and claimed to be prospectors who , had
lost their bearings. When shown a pho
togfaph of King they readily recognized
a close resemblance to the white man
they had seen on Saturday. Everything
points to the assurance that King la
reallv the man being pursued. Â¦-.âÂ¦:

prp;t*MrLT ar.<i disorder prevailed at
the meeting of the Republican
;' County Committee last nieht.
]^ Nothing was accomplished. Mem
bers who sought to advocate the
c<Joption of measures to provide for an
honest primary election could not be heard
en account of the uproar raised by ruffians
c.r.d rounders from the Mint saloon. When
ever a warning vclcÂ© was raised against
the surrender of the local organization to
CrimmJns and Kelly the speaker was as

ter. Confusion reigned from the etart to
the finish. The anti-boss programme was
to defeat action last night in order to com-
After the adjournment of the meeting
last night Dibble strenuously denied that
the Goldberg scheme emanated from him.
It is a well-known fact, however, that
Alfred Bouvier, chairman of the County
Committee; John C. Lynch. United States
Revenue Collector, and H. C Dibble held
ji secret and prolonged conference yester
day afternoon in a back room of the Re
publican State headquarters. Palace Ho
tel. It v.-as surmised by members of the
County Committee who had been apprised
of the afternoon secret conference that
the Goldberg scheme was then concocted.
It is a significant fact that Dibble and
Lynch attended the session last night and
pent for Bouvier just before the session
began, and he repponded to their sum
mons.
When Goldberg raw tho weakness of
his scheme he advocated an adjournment
until next Friday night. 1'rlor to the in
troduction of the boss' plan I. J. Truman
Jr. presented a fair proposition, but It
was not considered on its merits, as A.
In the work of demoralizing the organi

Lynch assisted the immediate followers
of Crimmins and Kelly. Kfforts were
made by Chairman Bouvier to secure an
orderly consideration of the business on
hand, but the howling rounders in the rear
of the hall paid do attention to his ruling*.
When Max Goldberg, a recognized
agent of the bosses, spoke the ruffianly
elements did not interrupt. Goldberg pre
sented a scheme to give Dibble and Wolf
the management of the primaries in their
respective districts, and to place the re
mainder of the works In the hands of
Crimmins and Kelly. The measure failed
to carry because A. Ruef raised the in
vincible point of order that the Goldberg
scheme aid not embrace a call for a con
vention or set forth the apportionment of
delegates to each district. The bosses
who framed the scheme and placed it in
Goldbergs hands for introduction over
looked the important fact that the call
for the convention previously adopted
had been overthrown by the action of
the Supreme Court decision.
plete the work of undermining the com
mittee and compelling its absolute cap'tu
lation to the bosses.
The uncompromising anti-boss Republi
cans have lost faith in Chairman Bouvier.
It is a known fact that he holds secret
conferences with Dibble and Lynch, who
represent nothing but the Southern Pa
cific political bureau. When he was chosen
chairman he promised to stand for the
people and advocate clean and decent pol
itics, but he is so wavering and uncertain
that Republicans of character and Inde
pendence have lost all regard for his pro
fessions of loyalty to high principles.
Expressions freely uttered after the ad
journment last night signify that the Re
publican taxpayers-' and property owners
will never submit to the boss rule of
Crimmins and Kelly. It wns asserted
that under the banner of McKlnley and
Roosevelt the law-abiding and decent Re
publicans wouid organize independently
of the bosses In every district of San
Francisco and fight the battle of reform
to the finish.
The stalwart anti-boss Republicans, who
have been true to the party and the peo
ple from the beginning of the campaign
against the bosses one year ago, acknowl
edged last night that Ilerrin, Kelly and
Crimmins. assisted by Lynch and others
in the employ of the Southern Pacific, had
practically gained control of the County
Committee.
Bosses Practically Controlled.
It was provided that a place for con
ducting the primaries should be prepared
by this subcommittee and submitted to the
Â¦whole committee for ratification. It was
argued that the proposition was fair in
all respects. A roll call was taken, which
resulted In a deffat of the motion. Forty
seven members voted against It and thir
ty-seven for it. After the announcement
of the vote, which was regarded as a test,
the bosses claimed that they had captured
the committee, and their claim was not
vigorously disputed.

SACRAMENTO, Aug. 7.â About two
weeks ago typical anthrax, or splenic
fever, broke out in the dairy herd on the
Tlttemore ranch, about seven miles up the
river from this city on the Yolo side, and
many of the cattle and several horses
have died. Dr. Megowan, Milk, Food and
Market Inspector of this city, recently
visited the ranch, and after a microscopic
examination of the blood, pronounced the
disease to be anthrax beyond a doubt.
The herd has been vaccinated and quar
antined and it is hoped there will be no
spread of the disease.

CULLED FOR
CALL READERS
FOREST INCENDIARISM.
OVER and over again The Call has warned the
holiday crowds that flock to the woods during
the summer season to beware of the danger of
starting those fires in the fields and the woods that
are so disastrous to the State. In these warnings it
has been assumed thnt the danger of such conflagra
tions was to be found almost wholly in the negligence
and carelessness of hunters, campers and others wan
dering in the woods and meadows, but it now appears
there are some people sufficiently vicious and reckless
to deliberately start fires with the intention of de
stroying crops, pastures and forests. *
In the reports from Los Angeles concerning the
fires in the mountains in that section -of the State it
was said: "Not to carelessness or accident alone is
attributed the widespread havoc wrought by the fire
in the Sa'n Gabriel forest reserve. To the act of
criminal negligence, to which, with apparent justice,
is ascribed the origin of the conflagration that has
been raging in the mountains north of Sierra Madre
for nearly two weeks, now is added the crime of in
cendiarism, according to late reports from the scene
of the fire in the Little Santa Anita canyon. If these
reports be true, the fire which broke out afresh in
the Little Santa Anita Wednesday afternoon was de
liberately set in three different places by some mis
creant." *
There is hardly any kind of malicious mischief a ras
cal can commit with such comparative safety from
detection as that of starting a fire in a field or in the
woods, consequently when a person is detected in
committing such an act the punishment should b?
about as severe as the law permits. Our forests are
being destroyed too rapidly by the hands of those who
at worst are only reckless or careless, and we cannot
admit any plea to be made in mitigation of the of
fense of the: man who deliberately starts such a fire.
The act is one of -wanton criminality and the cost to
the community may run up into millions of dollars.
Its punishment should therefore be as swift, as stern
and as sure as the*justice of the State can effect.

EDUCATED FILIPINO "SAVAGES."
THE yellow journals teem with reports concern
ing the "rebels" and "savages" of the Philip
pine Islands, but the truth is that these people
are neither "rebels" nor "savages."
They are not "rebels," because they have never
given their consent to the bargain by which they were
turned over to us by Spain, like so many sheep, for
the consideration of twenty million dollars.
Neither are they "savages," as a brief survey of the
history of education in the Philippines will show.
Only two years after the Hudson River was discov
ered, and nine years before- the Pilgrim Fathers
landed on Plymouth Rock, the Dominican Fathers
founded the College of Santo Tomas at Manila. In
1645 â about fifty years before the time when the good
people of Salem killed twenty old women and Indians
for witchcraft â the college of these benighted Philip
pine "savages" was erected into a university by Pope
Innocent X, and regular instruction was given by a
faculty of arts and a faculty of theology. In 1734 â
fifteen years before Benjamin Franklin founded the
University of Pennsylvania â a faculty of law was
added. In 1845â three years before gold was discov
ered in California, when the water-rat dived where
now run the Montgomery-street electric cars and
when the coyote howled on the site of San Jose â in
1845 the University of Manila had 581 students; in
1858 â ten years before the University of California
was founded â it had icoo. That is a pretty good rec
ord, in higher education, for "savages."
You cannot have a university without fairly good
primary and secondary schools leading up to it.
Even if we knew nothing about such education in the
Philippines, this " irrefutable, a priori proposition
would prove the existence of such schools. But we
have concrete testimony as to the existence of such
schools in the accounts published by Mallat (Paris,
1846), .Semper (Wurzburg, 1869), and by Maichs
(Paris. f887). According to these observers the
"Indians" (Tagales and Visayas) of the Philippine?
had alphabets of their own and could read and write
even before the arrival of the Spaniards. Blumen
tritt, the German ethnologist, who has made a close
study of the ethnic traits of these "Indians," says that
the number of those who attend the secondary schools
and the university is "relatively very large," and that
from them have come such politicians as Rizal, Del
Pilar and Ponce; such artists as Luna; ' such eth
nographers as Florentino and such linguists as Lak
tar, "who are all known outside of their own coun-
The Deutsche Rundschau for 1897 contains a
biographical notice of Jacobo Zobel de Zangroniz, a
Spanish-German who was born in Manila of wealthy
parents and received his university education in Ger
many. Returning to Manila, he became distinguished
as a litterateur and a scientist. His testimony as to
the character of the Filipino "savages" among whom
he lived is strangely at variance with that brayed out
by yellow imperialists who concoct foreign "news" at
home. "Two-thirds of the Tagales can read," he
says, "and about half of them can write. They are a
cheerful, peaceable people, are disposed to enjoyment,
and have an eye rather to pleasures and things that
are beautiful and attractive than to the useful and
profitable. * * * Art, especially music, is their
passion."
It is too much to c/pect of yellow journalists that
they should be able to write, but it may be presup
posedârashly, perhapsâ that they share with two
thirds of the Tagales the capacity to read. To those of
them who possess this accomplishment we commend
the perusal of the Precis upon which this article is

TEACHING CIVILIZATION.
THE Kaiser has been criticized for his gory pros
pectus of the work he intends his army shall do
for the cause of Christian civilization in Chim.
Take no prisoners and give no quarter is his terse
recipe for an exhibit of the superiority of Christian
civilization to barbarism.
Eut what he promises Russia seems to be already
performing. Germany and Russia, by their aggres
sions, their lawless seizure of territory, their violation
of every international right of China, ha%-e supplied
the provocation for r.n uprising which has made it
temporarily impossible for China to perform her in
ternational obligations. The assault on the Taku
forts and the sacking of Tientsin were acts of mili
tary aggression, based on reports of slaughter of the
foreign legations at Peking which have proved to
have been false.
The conduct of the Russian troops in those actions
at arms is now, for the first time, being made public
in detail.
The American missionaries who reached San Fran
cisco on the Logan were witnesses of the scenes
which they describe. Rev. Mr. Hayner, a Methodist
missionary, says the clash at Taku was caused by false
reports started by the Russians. When the Chinese
officers found themselves overpowered and capitulated
and marched out of the forts and offered their swords
in surrender, they were shot down by the Russians
"like a lot of dogs." Mr. Hayner says that in one
village the Russians drove the women and children
into the river, and when they attempted to come
ashore they were all shot and their bodies floated
away on the stream. He adds that the brutality of the
rr.inions of the Czar was astonishing in these days of
supposed civilization.
Mrs. Drew, wife of the Tientsin Commissioner of
Customs, says that when the foreigners vacated their
houses in that city after the surrender the residences
were looted, the Russians stealing everything they
could lay hands on, and they went around carrying
the heads of Chinese on their bayonets. '
It is gratifying that all of these refugees highly com
mend the coolness, humanity and good judgment of
Admiral Kempff. His abstention at Taku and refusal
tc believe the Russian report and follow the Cossack
aggression have made Americans the most popular
foreigners in China.
Indeed we may congratulate ourselves that Presi
dent McKinley, while standing firm for our interna
tional rights, has tempered firmness with the highest
fense of justice and the most intelligent appreciation
of the difficulties of the Chinese.
It is reported that this wise attitude has impressed
the Czar, who seems to see the hopelessness of justi
fying to the world a seizure of Chinese territory as
long as America's example stands in the way. It is
believed now that he is willing to join the United
State? in an agreement that the integrity of Chinese
territory shall be respected.
If this be true it is a conspicuous diplomatic triumph
for the United States. It will be in the interest cf
humanity, justice and the righteousness of the world
and will do more for civilization than a million sol
diers and a thousand battles won.
The great fear has been that out of the Chinese
situation would issue a prolonged war, first against
China and then by the jealous European powers
?gainst each other. If we succeed in drawing Russia,
England and Japan into line with the United States
r.nd get them in agreement to respect the territorial
rights of China, the war there will be of short dura
tion, and the apprehended after consequences will
r.ot take place. \

A horse performed the duties of a den

in a most expert manner.
William J. Smith was at work on his
place with his horse, when the animal
became restless on account of the files and
switched its tail vigorously. To Smith's
utter astonishment the horse's tail became
caught in the stem of his pipe and yanked
it out, carrying an incisor with It.
The tooth was extracted as quickly.
Smith says, and with no more pain than
if the operation had been performed by a
dentist. The tooth was perfectly sound.

A MENACE OF THE SEAS.
7- HE collier Wellington, on her arrival at this
port on Sunday, reported speaking the tugs
Rescue and Ta'toosh sixteen miles northwest of
Cape Mendocino with a log raft in tow, and it was
added the raft appeared to be going to pieces and big
logs were floating out from it. Later reports arc to
the effect that the /logs are drifting all * along the
Mendocino coast. That, of course, means a serious
menace to shipping, for the logs floating, about the
seas and tossed by the waves imperil every vessel
across whoSe course they drift.
The evil results of the attempts to tow huge rafts
along the coast have long been known to all who have
any dealings with marine affairs. In times past, when
similar means were employed in transporting lumber
from Maine to New York, the dangers to shipping
along the Atlantic coast were so great nnd the dis
asters so numerous that it was found necessary to for
bid the practice. It is now high time for preventive
measures to be adopted on this coa3t. A bill to that
effect has been presented to Congress by Senator
Perkins, but no action has as yet been taken upon k.
New efforts will of course be made to bring about the
enactment of the measure at the coming session, but
in. the meantime it will be worth while to consider
whether something in the way of remedy cannot be
provided at home.
Could the Harbor Commissioners forbid V the tow
ing of these huge rafts into the bay, or refuse them
landing privileges, the profits of the business would
be at an end, and the business; itself would stop.
Nobody would tow a raft down the coast if he could
not bring it into the harbor. It would seem, there
fore, to be well worth while for the Commissioners
to see what can be achieved by their authority in the
matter, for Congressional action is slow, and in an
emergency of this kind every day of delay adds to
the dangers.
The profits derived from successful raft shipments
must be very large, for attempts to raft millions of feet
of lumber to the city are made every year, notwith
standing that in nine cases out of ten the rafts go to
pieces. It is said that half a raft landed in San Fran
cisco will pay a dividend. The business is seemingly
something like a gamble, in which the chances
are against the adventurer, but a big reward awaits
the one who makes the trip successfully. The sup
pression of the attempts in that direction would,
therefore, be no injury to the legitimate lumber trade,
while it would be of great benefit to all kinds of ship
ping.
> The subject is one the merchants of the city should
at once investigate for the purpose of devising means
of checking the evil in advance of the action of Con
gress. If it be found that nothing can be done by
local authorities, then appeal should be made at once
to the officials at Washington. It is quite possible
that something could be effected in the way of rem
edy by the Federal officers under the general powers
given them to regulate coast trade. Nothing will be
lost, at any .rate, by an agitation of the subject. The
evil has been totally suppressed, we believe, on the
Atlantic coast, and there is no reason .why a similar
policy should not be enforced here.

POLITICAL HYPOCRISY.
\A R. HEARSTS Journal, one of the heavenly
/ \ twins in journalislh that were put into the
>' California platform, is making good Senator
Hill's cynical indorsement of the Kansas City plat
form. He said that one part of it could be advocated
in one section of the country and other parts in other
sections.
The free silver declaration is good in Colorado and
the intermountain States, but is offensive in the East.
Therefore Hearst's Journal proceeds to give a lethal
dose of editorial to free silver. He declares that it is
not in present politics, but was put into the platform
out of consideration for the personal feelings of
Colonel Bryan, though the convention was against it
by a two-thirds majority. Therefore, the Journal
says, in no contingency can the Democratic party be
expected to legislate for the restoration of silver, and
that the silver issue is dead and out of politics.
To this the Stockton Mail makes reply that "if four
years ago it had been printed as a forecast of Demo
cratic sentiment in 1000 it would have been hooted by
the whole party, save the handful of gold men. Is it.
therefore, the true sentiment of the party to-day? If
it is, what a lesson it conveys! It presents the Demo
crats in the position of taking the medicine prepared
for them by the Republicans and saying it is good,
i Even the Republicans four years ago would not have
i dared to treat the silver question as a dead issue.
Now the only thing that has happened to alter the
situation has been brought about by the agency of the
Republican party. It is the very thing which the
Democrats and scores of learned publicists through
out the country had warned the people against. They
declared that from the bold position of holding all
obligations of the Government payable in gold, no
matter what the language of the contract might be.
to the enactment of a law affirming the gold dollar to
be the unit of value, was a step so easy that it would
surely be taken. The results following such a con
tiaction of the currency were pictured as of the direst
character. At-iast it has happened, and we find the
country concurring in it as a whipped child, simply
because it is an accomplished fact. The efforts of the
New York Journal to make it appear that the gold
standard vtrill in no contingency be in danger from the
party which has resolved in favor of free silver con
stitutes the great anomaly of the campaign to date.
Gold votes cannot be coaxed over by any such
friendly Indian pretense, whereas there are a lot of
silver votes and good, hard-headed Democratic votes
that would throw themselves to anything to beat a
party so pusillanimous, treacherous and contemptible
as to seek support from the enemy by promising to be
grood to it."
There you have it. The Janus face is glowering
upon the country. Democrac3' is one thing in New-
York and quite another thing in California. But the
California convention has specifically indorsed the
Journal as a great exponent of Democracy, and it ex
pounds to the effect that no contingency can arise in
which the party will overthrow the gold standard es
tablished by the Republicans. Yet the daily papers
are talking of Chinese duplicity as an article superior
to any of which the Caucasian is capable!
based. They will find it in volume I, page 968, of the
last report of the United States Commissioner of
Education.

This magnificent collection of paintings
Is very well housed and advantageously |
displayed in the Prado. and the general i
good condition of the canvases testifies to Â¦
both the intelligent care of the director
and the Cry, pure air of Madrid. The
catalogue, edited by the eminent writer.
Don Pedro de Madrizo. Is well made, and
is issued in both Spanish and French. The I
gallery is open, free to the public on Sun- |
day and on weekdays there is a small ad- |
mlttanee fee, equivalent to a dime. From
the Puerta del Sol (the great square in
the center of Madrid) the visitor ap
proaches the museum through the Car
rera de San Geronimo, passing the palace
of the Cortes and a fine monument to Cer
vantes on the way.
The museum contains two main picture
galleries, each about 130 by 33 feet in di
mensions, wall lighted from the top, and
devoted to the Spanish school. The num
erous side galleries 'opening to right and
left are lighted from the sides, therefore
the light is fluctuating and on cloudy days
rather scanty. These rooms are devoted
to the Italian. Dutch, French and Flem
ish schools, respectively. Half way down
the great central galleries a door opens
into the so-ealied salon of Queen Isa
bel, a room hung with the most popular
and famous paintings in the collection,
chosen from all schools and forming a
group of about 100 works, brought togeth
er on the same plan as that of the balon
Carre of the Louvre and the Tribune of
Florence. This gallery Is oval, and Is
lighted from overheard. Were the actual
and supposed masterpieces here assem
bled to be weeded out to-day, there would
be some radical changes in the arrange
ment, no doubt; however, the room Is re
markably rich in good things as It Jss. To
name only a few of the most celebrated
and valuable works In it, there are Ra
phael's "Virgin of the Fish." "Holy Fam
ily of the Lamb," "Virgin of the Row,"
"Holy Family of the Lizard" and "Por
trait of a Cardinal"; Titian's "Tribute to
the Goddess of Love," "Venus and
Adonis," "Bacchanal" and portraits of
Charles V and Philip II; Tintoretto's
"Portrait of a Young Man." "Sebastian
Venieri." etc.; Velasouez'jf "Drinkers,"
"Mercury and Argus." "Portrait of a
Sculptor." "Court Jester." "Forge of \ ul ;
can,'' "St. Anthony's Visit to St. Paul *
"Don Fernando of Austria" and 'Portrait
of a Man," with many choice examples
of Veronese. Rubens. \ an Dyck, Holbein.
Claude. Poussln. Ribera. Moro. Murillo.
Coiresrgio, Giorglone, IMirer. Cano. Rem
brandt: Fra Angelico. Giulio Romano.
Guldo. Van Dyck. Lunl and Guerdno. In
fact, there are few rooms in the world
holding a more striking group of interna-
But the one supreme and sufficient
glory of the Madrid Museum Is not the
heterogeneous gathering of star can
vases in the salon of Queen Isabel
it is the possession of the only great ana
representative collection of the wor ks of
Velasquez, the prince of Spanish painters,
and one of the most extraordinary lum
inaries of the world of art since painting
was invented. This distinction alone
would be enough to set the Madrid Mu
seum apart upon a pinnacle of ita own.
Without traveling to Madrid no one can
really know Velasquez. He stands espe
cially for the somewhat indefinable but
nevertheless very real spirit of aristoc
racv. which was to some extent exempli
fied" in the work of Van Dyck though In
a lfss deep way. The fact of his being
a court painter does not necessarily en
ter into the causes of his mental attitude
toward mankind. Velasquez was more
aristocratic himself than were his noblest
fitters. He was the gentleman of gentle
men In art, and he ennobled everything
that ho tcucbed. He has reserve power:
there is a touch of perfection In his re
finement that makes all pretense seem
Ineffably mean; never has there been
Â«uch genuineness, such perfect poise, such
unasÂ«:umed distinction of manner, such un
conscious authority and inborn elegance.
The first thought of most persons, on see
ing a portrait by Velasquez for the first
time Is: "How very simple and easy! Is
thatVll there is of this wonderful artist?"
There is a feeling akin to disappointment:
one was possibly expecting: something
d?zzlingr. unusual, phenomenal. But no:
there is nothing in Velasquez that !s sen
sational at all: his scheme of color is usu
ally very quiet, based on pray and brown
tones without great brilliance, though
soberly rich and deep: striving for effect
is utterly foreign to him: he was Just sim
ply the most natural of painters.
The most remarkable pictures by Velas
quez are "Las Hilanderas" ("The Tar*?s
try Weavers"). "Las Meninas" ("The
Maids of Honor"). "Las Lanzas" ("The
Surrender of Breda"), an equestrian por
trait of the Duke of Ollvarez. the various
portraits of King Philip IV and of his
children, the Princess Mary Margaret and
Prince Balthasar Charles, with the eight
pieces hung in the salon of Queen Isa
bel, which have been mentioned above.
But it must be remembered that all of
Velasquez's sixty-four pictures in Madrid
are remarkable, Â¦ and that all the other
museums in the world cannot show so
many, to say nothing of quality. Nothing
that Velasquez did was trivial or un
worthy, though it would be too much to
expect that all of his productions should
exhibit equal merits.
Perhaps there does not exist a more per
fect specimen of painting than "Las Me-
were his early mythological Â»ubjects fully
expressive of hi3 true personality. Some of
his landscapes are vastly admired by good
judges of art, but he used landscape cus
tomarily merely as a background for his
portraits. Among the American painters
who have worshiped fervently at the
shrine of the master are John S. Sargent.
James McN. Whistler, William M. Chase
and Frederick P. Vinton. The purity and
nobility of his style make him an admira
ble examplar for painters. Hla Influence*
is wholesome and elevating. He had every
negative merit possible â no tricks of tha
brush, no commonplaces, no affectation.
no artificiality, no self-consciousness. A
profound and innate integrity of sentiment,
an utter and unsought Individuality and
originality, and a complete spontaneity
and naturalness set his works apart. Their
material beauty and nobility is apparent
to all, but their highest and deepest qual
ity Is spiritual and mental, the perfectest
pictorial expression of a rare and lofty
soul.

Eddy Ceedar disfigured himself for life
vesterday. The lad is only 10 years old,
but powder and dumdum bullets have no
terrors for him. Yesterday morning he
wns playing with a can of ordinary gun
powder, and putting a lighted match too
close to the can it went off. Dr. Baciga
lupl treated Eddy for the loss of the tip
of his nose, compound fracture of the
nose, lacerated wound of the upper lip
and a badly contused mouth and lower
The log raft is outside. It was oft Point
Reyes at 6:50 a, m. yesterday and was off
the heads late last night. It was decided
to let it remain out all night and come in
with, the tide to-day. Experts say the
huge structure is not as badly damaged
as was at first reported.
W. E. Miehell, the well-known ship
owner and manager of the- California Ship
Company, went to Puget Sound last night.
Eight of the company's vessels are now
on the Sound and two of Mr MigheU's
own vessels are there also. Mr. Mlghell
expects to be gone twa- weeks.
The steamer City of Para arrived from
Panama last night. She will be passed
by the quarantine officials to-day. Among
the other late arrivals were the ship
Eudora from London, and, the Hawaiian
bark Willscott from Newcastle. England.
WATER FRONT NOTES.
Miss Becbe Bean, who came back on
the Sherman, is well known here. She has
been nearly prostrated with dysentery,
but is now recovering, as a friend of the
soldiers she was known all over the Pre
sidio, and when the City of Para sailed
for Manila with her favorite regiment she
dressed in male attire and sailed with
them as one of the cabin boys. Since then
she has been among the men at all times
and comes home borne down by sickness,
but laden with "news."
Private Dave Boltz will probably end
his days on Alcatraz. He Is sentenced to
forty years' imprisonment. While under
arms Boltz deserted to the enemy and
now there is no name more execrated
among the troops in the Philippines than
his.

There were twelve prisoners on the
Sheridan and these were landed at Alca

Ten of the men were sentenced for minor
offenses, but Sergeant Richardson stole
$1800 of his comrades' money and got five

The army transport Sherman came over
from quarantine yesterday and docked at
Folsom 2. She made a record run of twen
ty-two days from Manila and Chief En
gineer Kingsley Is jubilant in conse
quence. There was never a hitch through
out the journey and the machinery per
formed like clockwork.
Those who came over in the cabin of
the Sherman are:

RECENTLY ARRIVED VESSEL THAT IS THE TAIK OF THE WATER FRONT.
THE four-maeted Americana that ar- |
rived from the nitrate ports via
Honolulu late Monday night is the
most peculiarly rigged schooner that
ever came inrST* this port. No one is
willing to father the Invention, but
judging from the schooner's perform
ances the rig is not a success. The
Americana was 159 days coming from
Caleta Buena, and at one time 50 per cent
reinsurance was paid on her. She put
into Honolulu, however, and was then 61
days coming from that port to San Fran
cisco. This Is the record slow passage
from the nitrate ports to San Francisco.
The Americana carries a jib topsall,-Â»*rn
inward and an outward Jib, a fore gaff
topsail, a fore and aft foresail, a square
foresail, a main topgallant sail, main top
sail and fore and aft mainsail, mizzen and
gaff topsail and spanker and gaff topsail.
In spite of all this spread of canvas the
best the Americana could do was about
100 knots a day. She was very foul, how
ever, having been for a long time in the
water without being drydocked.
Captain Berry got himself into trouble
with the quarantine officer. He had not
been In San Francisco for nearly five
years, and not knowing of changes in the
quarantine laws sailed his vessel in and
anchored off Harrison-street wharf. Yes
terday Dr. Kinyoun ordered the vessel
back to an anchorage off Black Point,
There he visited her and then Captain
Perry was allo'wed to dock his vessel at
Union rtreet.
ANOTHER SCHOONER IN TROUBLE.
The Carrier Dove from New Ycrk for
Seattle put in here In distress late Mon
day night. Her rudder was damaged and
the vessel was leaking, so the captain de
cided to make San Francisco. This was
all the mere necessary as the crew was
almost down to starvation diet. For three
weeks there had been nothing to eat but
beans. There was no canned goods and
no bread, but luckily plenty of water.
"Water and be;\ns therefore were the sta
ples on the Carrier Dove for three weeks.
Some of the men on the little schooner
teH wild stories. A sea serpent swallow
ed half the loRline in the straits of Ma
gellan, a witch doctor drove the Bhlp's
dog into spasms, the members of the Lon
don Missionary Society in Patagonia have
turned pirates and are looting passing
vessels, an ex-missionary has a mania for
murdering the natives and a thousand
notches on the barrel of his gun is the
record of the number of natives murdered
in cold blood. These and similar blood
curdling stories the sailors tell of their
sojourn In the "land of flre."
The Carrier Dove was intended for ser
vice between Fuget Sound ports, but it is
doubtful if she will ever reach there. It
will cost considerable to repair .her and
the chances are she will be sold to the
highest bidder. When the schooner was
at Punta Arenas two of the crew desert
ed and men to take their places were
picked up on the beach. On arrival here
Crew of Schooner Carrier Dove Says Lo % ndo.n Mis

The Royal Museum of the Prado In Ma
drid contains the most remarkable col
lection of pictorial masterpieces in the
world. It Is a collection which makes
no claim to completeness, and the primi
tive examples of the various European
schools are almost wholly wanting In it.
Again, although a certain master may be
fully represented by an unequaJed group
of his best works, another and equally
great artist of the school may not be rep
resented In the museum at all. This fault.
If It be one, is easily overlioked In view
of the marvelous strength of the collec
tion in certain special lines, which makes
It one of the most sacred of all meccas
for the artistic pilgrim. Thus, while It is
inferior to the Louvre in Paris as a his
toric assemblage of the world's greatest
paintings, it Is even more brilliant as a
collection of masterpieces, more or Ies3
unrelated and more or less unclassified.

NEW YORK. Aus. 7.â The recent disposition
to refrain from operating in Ftocks and to await
a clearer development of the prospect was re
inforced to-day by the extreme heat, which
reached a level Inducing prostrations on the
floor of the exchange. With the exception of
occasional execution of oniÂ«*rs in a few stocks
where special causes were at work, the list was
alir.ort wholly neglected. During the early part
of the day some considerable declines were es
tablished, but when the room traders came to
close up their contracts the losses were in large
part wiped out. The most conspicuous Individ
ual movement wa3 In United States rubber,
which Jumped S*i from the early low point not
long before the clore. Punishment was visited
rs a result upon the shcrt interest which rushed
to cover, making some enow of animation in
stocks. Northern Pacific's larce increase In
earnings for the fourth week In July brought
realizing and the grangers were heavy on the
weather bureau's weekly crop report, showing
need of rain in the corn belt. The steel stocks
sagged on the further Â»-Â»ductlon in the prices ot
iron warrants. Rome of the recently inactive
stocks showed wide declines, including Chl
capo Great Western, Lake Erie & 'Western.
Iowa Central and the local traction stocks.
Some of the early selling was based on the
beginning of the told export movement. En-
Rapements amounted to only about $2,500,000,
whereas the miniates yesterday pointed to
$4,000,000 and upward. Reports from London
were that the Bank of England was now giv
ing special facilities to attract gold from New
York. Otherwise it Is not probable that gold
would have gone out at to-day's figure for
sterling. The rate for demand sterling fell
back a fraction aÂ« a result of sales of bills
against irold exports. It is announced, however,
that more (fold will go out Thursday. To-day's
shipments are supposed to have l<eÂ«>n to cover
the required deposit of 5 r#r cent accompany
ing applications for war loans.
American subscriptions are credibly reported
to have exceeded $50,000,000 or the entire amount
of the bonds offered. The allotment by the
British Exchequer of Â£5.000.000 of the Â£10,000,
ft") lysue for the United States therefore In
sures American bidders about SO per cent of
their applications. Future payments are re
quired on August 15 of 20 per cent, on Septem
ber 14 of 2S per cent, on October 15 of 23 per
cent and r.n November 15 of 23 per cent, of the
bonds Issued at 98. This would make It feasible
to distribute the remittances over a consider
able period, but there is also a provision that
the installments may be paid in full on or
after August 15, under a discount at the rate
of 3 per cr.L No information can be obtained
as to how remittances will be made and this
contuses the estimates ae to the future effect
on the money market. Gold continues to ac
cumulate in New York on payments by the sub
treasury to the banks of drafts on account of
sold deposited at Pacific points. The banks
have pained from the sub-treapury since Friday
$2.Cs2.Â« i 0 on this account. The money market
is therefore little affected by the gold exports.
Bonds were dull and irregular. Total sales,
par value. $625,000. United States 2s declined

COAST AXD BAY SECTIONS.
UnufualJy high temperatures prevailed frcm
the 1st to the 3d, causing fruit to ripen rapidly,
ard in some places it is reported that the hot,
dry winds did considerable damafre to tomato
vine?, grapes and r runee. Pe<-iJunus fruits are
l.eintr pathered: drylmr. canning and shipping
are pnjpressiric:. the yield throughout the sec

if said to be Immense, and picking will com
mence during the we^k. O--ai>es are looking
well in most places, and will probably yield a
Bpod crr-p in the northern counties. Beetles are
injuring potatoes in portions of Scnoma County.
Harvrsting and thrashing continue: the yieid
of wheat !6 much l-elow average, and in some
places the quality is Inferior. Extensive fires

SAX JOAQUIN VALLEY.
Warn:, cl^ar weather, favorable for harvest-
Ing and the maturing of the fruit crop, pre
vailed during the week. Drying north winds
occurred on teveral <*ays, but did no damage to
the crops. Grain harvesting is about over, and
in most sections the yield is considerably below
the average. Nearly all of the grain harvested
has been chipped to the warehouses and is
being held for higher prices. The warehouses
In some sections are l>eln? taxed to their ut
most capacity. Kenorts from all pectior.s are
favorable for a large fruit crop. Farmers are
tusy gathering their fruit, and the canneries
end dried fruit packing houses are running to
their full capacity. Peaches are the principal
fruit bf-lrsg put up p.t present. In some sections
labor Is scarce, fc'ome fruit is beinjr shipped to
Fouthrrn California, and the market in the
northern part of the Htate is being kept fully
supplied. Pear*, plums and prunes are doing
m-ell. Watermelons and table grapes are being
marketed. Citrus fixlt is in good condition.
The second crop of figs promises to be very
good. The second crop of alfalfa ir nearly
raved, and is of good quality. Stock are in

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.
Extreme heat during a portion O f the week
has l>e<:-n Injurious to walnuts and deciduous

places, while in others the nuts and trees are
in excellent condition; there will be a fair
crop. Citrus fruits are reported In pplendid
condition in most places, and a heavy yield
Is predicted. Corn and tomatoes were some
what damaged by the heat. Water is becoming

Dried Fruit in Nezv York.
The New Tcrk Commercial Bays:
There was more business in dried fruits yes
terday than for some time. The feature of
greatest moment was the awakening interest
in new apricots. Huyers are at la-Â«t beginning
to arrive at the conclusion evidently that apri
cot? at the existing prires are low, and are
taking hold more freely than at any timÂ» this
fcaKin. Reports from the coaFt tell of a very
much firmer feelirg there, with a tendency
toward a Ftill higher market. Fine quality
g'Ktds are undoubtedly scarce, and it Is thi*
lact. without much question, that is tending to
curry the market upward. Sales of five cars
of new apricots were re;>orted here yesterday.
pr!c*-F ranging from 6V<Â£iS<-. f. o. b.
Interort in currants continues active, and
pales made yesterday led to a ptlll hipher
rrarket here, the price being advanced by thÂ«
leading holder to fi*c. Two sales of about CO
l;lils. ea^h were made to |>oints in the West
the firrt at 6 13-lfic and the second sale at 6?Â»c!
Sales of smaller lots to the loctl market were
Â» 1 ported at <PÂ«o.
Three-crown loose Muscatel raisins nre in
very good demand for this season, sales of two
carp on the coast being isade here yesterdav.
The rale of another car of ppot three-crow'n
ptK'tJs was reported at from 74/7'ic. Imported
Fultanas are held very lirm'y. with some con-
PideriiWe business pending.
Kuture appl.-s went higher yesterdav. and
Bfclfc? 'it several cars were made at an advance

It was re;KÂ»rted that nn offer of for two
rnrs was turned down. Predictions are now
made ihst the market will advance to :.c.
Others believe that the price will go down
again in a short time. There is likely to be
corriderable speculation if the market stays
around the present figure or drops again.

CHICAGO. Aug. 7.â At the opening in wheat
and a few minutes after an excitedly lively
business was done compared with the almost
utter stagnation of recent sessions. Early
quotations from Liverpool furnished a big sur
prlce to local traders, showing an advance in
that market of lUÂ©l%d. The advance was said
to be due to exceptionally bad weather all over
the United Kingdom, greatly interfering with
harvesting operations. Opening quotations In
September ranged from about %c to a full cent
over yesterday's closing prices, the range bn-
Ing from 764c to 764c. But there the advance
stopped and it took but a few minutes of the
heavy realizing which started at once to force
prices back quite materially. Offerings for
some time wer* heavy, long wheat coming out
in large quantities, principally from local hold
ers, though houses with foreign connection*
were also prominent In the selling. There were
apparently plenty of buying orders In the mar
ket at 7Cc and under and the market was noi
often allowed to go below that figure up to
the noon hour, the lowest point touched up to
that time being 75T(.c. After noon the market,
which had gradually become extremely dull,
became heavy also. The crowd was evidently
long and the market declined to 75%c, mostly
from its own weight. Shortly before the close
liberal export sales gave a better tone to thi
market, September* advancing to 7Â«Vic bid,
where it closed.
Corn was dull for the most part, but firm at
all times. September closed %@"ic higher at
3S4fc3SHe.
Oats were quiet, but steady. September
closed >;c higher at 214@22c.
Provisions were steady, with a fair general
trade, with packers the best buyers. There
was some outside demand, presumably in
fluenced by the Government demands for meats.
There were no new disturbing elements as re
gards the yellow fever outbreak. At the clois
September pork was 24c higher; lard and ribs
each 24c higher.
The leadlnr futures ranged as follows:
Sifccr and Sterling Exchange firmer.
11' Jurat dull, with higher futures.
Barley finn at a slight advance.
Oats finn, but quiet. Rye dull.
Corn lozL'rr under resumed Eastern imports.
Flour and Millstuffs unchanged.
Hay in irregular receipt. Feed stuffs steady.
Beans and Seeds dull and nominal.
Oniojus and Szvcet Potatoes lower. Tomatoes higher again.
Butter, Cheese and Eggs quiet with ample supplies.
Melons in free supply and lower.
Peaches end Pears a little better on canning account.
Dried Fruit market firm, with free inquiries from the East.
Provisions dull at the advanced quotations.
Wool at last sliows more firmness and activity.
Leather in fair demand. Hides unchanged. Tallozv weak.
Hops neglected by buyers.
Sez-cral slight variations in the Meat market.
Grain Bags off again.
Coal firm at previous prices.

little Australian being- loaded which has not

Tallow is weak. Hides, as already mentioned,
are relatively about a cent higher here than
at Chicago, as the tanners are buying to meet
a fair demand for leather. The Eastern mar
kets continue congested and weak.
Hops are quoted dull and nominal. The Cali
fornia crop Is reported short, but crops else
where are said to be abundant, so no scarcity
is expected. Buyers show no anxiety to make
contracts.
The Wool market at last shows a change for
the better, and quotations for several descrip
tions are a ehade higher. There Is also more
activity, as the demand is improving. The
Fall clip is not making' much show here as

5Â® 6c for white.
The East is getting impatient for new Prunes
and Raisins and is sending a good many tele
grams out here for quotations, which, however,
they are unable to get. The quotations for
Prunes may be expected any day now, though
it is possible they may still be delayed a week
yet. Nobody seems to have any idea as to what
the opening base price will be.
The fruit market as a rule Is firm and slow
ly tending upward. Apricots are leading, as
choice stock is scarce and the East is looking
for It. With the, possible exception of Apples
there is no really weak fruit on the list.
Butter, Eggs and Cheese continue quiet at
about the same quotations. All are in ample
supply, and Cheese is in especially large stock,
with more sellers than buyers. The demand
for packed Butter and cold storage Eggs is
not yet heavy, though some sales are being
made.

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
The Melon market ia decidedly weaker, and
quotations ehow a decline all around, owing to
the cooler weather and heavy receipts. Grapes,
too, are in liberal supply and slow.
Dealers are quoting a small advance in bulk
prices for Peaches and Pears for canning ac
count. Plums are in fair supply and steady
at the low prices. Figs and Nectarines are
scarce, but the latter are cheap, being small
and undesirable as a rule.
Berries continue to bring good prices.
Citrus fruits show no change worthy of note.

The sequel of a runaway match was

has just been legally separated from him.
As the girl's parents objected to Ihe

LAST CHANCE GIVEN TO

COLLAPSE OF INSECURE
WALLS CAUSES PANIC
.Rickety, Structure Trembles, but For
tunately Does Not Completely
Collapse.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
111S Broadway, Aug.' 7.
The collapse of the partitions. In the old
Cavalry Hall building, at Twelfth and
"Washington streets, which is being remod
eled by a force of carpenters, was the
cause of a panic this afternoon among the
patrons of the stores on the ground floor
of the flimsy structure. Timbers were
hurled into the street, and an unknown
lady, walking on Washington street nar
rowly missed being struck, by a fourteen
inch beam as it fell from the second story
. Many thought the whole shell would
collapse, and places of safety were eagerly
sought.
About 3:30 this afternoon, while car
penters were sawing a fourteen-lnch tim
ber on the second floor, the wooden girder
snapped, and within a second nearly every
partition fell to the lloor with a crash
that threatened to plunge them through
on to the people In the stores beneath.
The rickety old structure trembled for
several minutes, and it was some time be
fore the carpenters resumed their work.
When the crash came the markets on
Twelfth . and Washington streets were
crowded with afternoon shoppers. Women
and children screamed and hurried for
the middle of the streets, and from the
Gas Kitchen restaurant, a score of cus
tomers, cooks and waiters rushed for the
open air.
Tho shock broke all the chandeliers in
the restaurant, besides demolishing a
quantity of crockery and glassware. Cav
alry Hall is a wooden building erected
many years ago by the late H. D. Bacon,
and it now belongs to his estate. It is
now being remodeled. There are walls
only one brick thick on two sides only,
and the work of the carpenters has great
ly weakened the old structure.

ROGERS SENT TO
SERVE OUT HIS
FULL FIVE DAYS
After the manner of the King of France
and his famous march up the hill and
down again, James Taylor Rogers went
from Jail to the Supreme Court and from
the Supreme Court to Jail again. His pe
titioji for a writ of habeas corpus was
"discharged" yesterday and he was re
manded to the custody of tho Sheriff.
The petition was heard before Justices
Beatty. Harrison. Henshaw, Temple and
Van Dyke, the opposing counsel stipulat
ing after the hearing was over that thÂ«
absent Justices. Garoutte and Harrison,
nhould be allowed to participate in the
decision. It looked at lirst, when the
court retired to deliberate, that there
would be no decision except on the ques
tion of allowing bail, for which Mr. Hen
ley had asked, but Judge Garoutte came
in while they were discussing the matter
and with him a decision on the principal
issue was reached. The opinion was writ
ten by, Justice Henshaw, Justices Harri
eon, Garoutte and Van Dyke concurring.
So far as the decision Is concerned, it
throws but little light ot the case and
only paves the way for another proceed
ing in contempt and another appeal. There
were eleven questions propounded which
Rogers refused to answer. If any one of
these were rele\-ant and pertinent and
capable of being answered without tend
ing to incriminate the witness or degrade
his character, then in refusing to re
ply the witness was clearly in contempt.
Then, looking over the questions, the
court found this one: "Did John M. Chre
tien Inform you that John Sullivan was
not the legal heir of Joseph Sullivan, de
ceased?" This question, the court held,
was plainly pertinent and relevant, and
It Is apparent on the face of It that no
answer, either "yea" or "no," could pos-
Mbly incriminate or degrade the witness.
Therefore he was in contempt. Therefore
he must go back to Jail to serve out his
Hve days.
This completes the circle and Rogers
is Just where he started, except that in
trying to stand straight and avoid say
ing too much he has fallen backward and
landed in Jail. The principal issues in the
case have not been touched upon at all,
and when Rogers comes out of jail he will
be asked to answer the questions again.
He will undoubtedly answer the one pass
ed upon by the Supreme Court, and then
he may stick on the others if he pleases.
When he does the questions will go to
the Supreme Court again, where they
may be ruled upon.
When the proceedings opened yesterday
afternoon. Judge Heatty narrowed the in
quiry from the start to the validity of the
order of the Superior Court directing Rog
ers to answer the questions propounded.
If the order was invalid, he said, there
was no question but that Rogers had dis
obeyed it. Deuprey then objected to any
matters other than those Inclosed in the
last proceeding in court being made a
part of the case at bar, but Henley was
allowed a little more latitude.
He argued that tht\ affidavit setting
forth the refusal to answer and the con
sequent contempt, must show not only
the questions asKed but also that they
were relevant and material to the Issue.
AH In the affidavit that went In support
of their materiality, he said, was the
mere allegation that they were relevant
and material.
Deuprey then spoke briefly for the re-
Fpondents. He said it was a plain case of
a witness refusing to answer questions
after having been ordered to do so by the
court. The questions asked, he said, had
been decided by the Superior Court to be
relevant and material, and It had been
further ascertained by the court that they
did not tend to degrade the witness nor to
Incriminate him. He is not tho Judge of
the tendency of his answers, argued Deu
prey: it is fertile court to Judge of the
consequence. Tney were only before the
court to answer one questionâ had the
court exceeded Its Jurisdiction In making
tho order? If on the face of the commit
ment the court found that the lower court
had not exceeded Its Jurisdiction, then.
Deuprev claimed, the petitioner had no
standing before the Supreme Court.
The question of bail was then taken up.
It appeared to be a simple thing that
Henley asked when he requested that his
client be released on bail pending a de
cision In the case, but it presented an
other knotty problem and the court with
drew to weptle with it. It is the con
tention of some of the Supreme Court
Justices that in matters of habeas corpus
the Supreme Court has power only either
to discharge or remand the prisoner.

spacious hall on the evening of August
13. J. E. Geary and Peter ZambriÂ«Â«ki are
the committee !n charge ot the arrarse
nnrnts for the ball.
Bogers rose during the discussion and an
nounced that tlu-re was no fear of him
leaving the city, but he wfis told it was
a question of power the court was dis
cussing, not the possibilities of his escape.
Was Hope for Rogers.
It was the prevailing opinion that Rog
ers would go free after the length of time
the court was spending in deliberation,
leading tho waiting onVs to believe the
main question was being discussed. This
was gathered from the remarks of the
Judges from the bench and from the fact
that even upon the suggestion of the court
Deuprey refuse*] to argue the validity of
the order to answer made by the Superior
Court. The decision was therefore some
thing of a surprise until the reasons for
it were read.
1 The action of the Supreme Court may
not have ended with the remanding of
I Bogers. however. It is the opinion of
lawyers that the court may take Judicial
! notice of the grounds for Rogers' refusal
j to answer and disbar him by an order
I from the bench. Since the first ordeal be
j fore tho Grand Jury Bogers has taken no
' pains to conceal the fact that he fears he
will be convicted of a felony should he
! answer. Conviction of a felony is good
| cause for the disbarment of any attorney
! so convicted, and it is generally believed
j the Supreme Court can and will take this
; view of it. In that event no motion wili
\ be n<*essary on the part of the Bar As
i soclatlon or any other organization or per
; son. The affidavit of Rogers setting forth
: his fears under oath is evidence enough
I that he has been gtiilty nf something
! serious enough to make his disbarment
i necessary for the health of the legal pro
j fesslon. And that affidavit is on file in
the Supreme Court.

In achieving the rescue Cavanaugh came j
near sacrificing his own life. It was only j
after a hard struggle that he made the
shore with the half-drowned Johnson,
who weighs over 200 pounds.
Mrs. Cavanaugh deserves almost as
much credit for the rescue as her hus
band. From the kitchen window of her j
home near the foot of Post street she saw j
a man sailing a small boat off the bay I
shore. Whilo ?he was looking the boat !
capsized, throwing the man into the wa- j

one hand he held on and with tho othci j
waved frantically to attract attention. |
Mrs. Cavanaugh sent her S-year-old son j
Harry to tell her husband, who was at j
work on a scaffolding, of the accident
Letting himself to the ground as soon
as ho could, Cavanaugh ran to a skiff
belonging to him that Â¦was tied to the

went down the second time. But the wind
was blowing hard, making It difficult to
manage the skiff with one oar. The res
cuer saw that he must act quicklv if
he would save the man. Without taking
time to remove any of his clothing he
jumped overboard and swimming to him
caught hold of his shirt collar.
The strupKles of the water-logged man
threatened to carry his rescuer down to
a watery grave with him. He grasped
Cavanangh i arms bo tightly as to make
him almost powerless, to swim. The
strons wind had blown the skiff away,
leaving nothing for C.ivanaugh to do but
make for the shore. Fortunately for the
men the tide was on the ebb. which as
sisted materially. Upon finally reaching
land CavanauRh fell, exhausted, with his
burden.
Rescuer and rescued were revived by"
stimu!nnt3 furnished by resident* who
had been attracted to the seem* Ty tho

to pet ashore. The boat was recovered
some distance from the point where it
capsized.

New York. Mr. Davis participated freely
in the conversations and announced his
intention to speak during the campaign
in several States of the Union.
Mayor Harrison introduced Mr. Bryan,
who said :
I am a very cautious man, and -while I have
seen It stated in the papers that I was nomi
nated for the Presidency I know that you can
not always trust what you see in the papers
(laughter) and I am not going to take It for
granted that I have been nominated until I am
officially notified of it down at Indianapolis.
I don't want to make a speech as the Presi
dential candidate until I am sure I am nomi
nated. (Laughter nnd great applause.) Mr.
Stevenson, the nominee for the Vice Presi
dency, Is along, and Governor Thomas of Colo
rado, who Is to notify him of his nomination,
ig on the train, and I believe has privately in
formed him that he has been nominated. There
fore he has more reason for making a speech
than I have, and I take pleasure in presenting
to you your candidate for Vice President, who
Is, I hope and believe, to be the next Vice
President of the United Staotes, Hon. Adlal
E. Stevenson. (Applause.)
The circumstance that the train was an
hour behind schedule time In reaching
Indianapolis did not seem to dampen the
interest of the great crowd which waited.
It was with much difficulty that the party
reached their carriages. When Mr. Bry
an's well known tigure was recognized In
the marching column a great shout was
sent up and cheers followed him con
stantly until he arrived at the Grand Ho
tel. The streets were lined so thickly
with people that it was with difficulty that
progress could be made, and it was 8 p. m.
beforo the travelers sat down to dinner.
After dinner Mr. Bryan and Mr. Steven
son wore given a general reception at the
Grand Hotel. They shook hands with a
very large number of people and chatted
pleasantly for a few moments with many
of them. Mrs. Bryan and Mrs. Stevenson
were entertained by a committee of ladles.

"The Boera attacked the garrison at

who was on the way to Elands River. Ian
Hamilton, who reached liustenbursr yes

TO BE ANXIOUS
TO SURRENDER
DULUTH, Minn.. Aug. 7.â Former Con-
Krtpp:na!i C. A. Towr.e. who was noml
i.a,tcd for Vice President by the Populist
convention held in Sioux Fails in May,
l,as sent the following letter to the com
ir.itioe on notification:
Gentlemen: When, on the Cth of July, at
Kaneae City. I had the honor to receive from
you the olficial nomination of your national
convention for the office of Vice President. I
requested, !n view of the anomalous and dell
. ate circumstances in the Presidential situation,
tl.^t you permit me to take the subject under
careful advisement before announcing a de-
ois;on. Th'.p request you were pleased to grant
ar.d now, after mature consideration of all
the factor* involved that concern the welfare
<Â¦:" tl-.e cause of political reform in this country
and my own duty thereto. I am constrained
to inform you in a!l respect that I mutt decline
the nomination tendered me by that conven
tion.
In arjiounrlr.c thin conclusion I cannot for
l*ar tc ?xrrÂ»?Â» to you and through you to the
irreat convention Â» h^s* >Â«immlfslon you hold,
as wen as to that patriotic body of advanced
political thought that your convention repre
sented, my deep eerse of the honor conferred
ujx>n me. to be the unanimous choice of that
<Â¦< invention for the second rlÂ»ce in the service
t*f the nation. Two clrnimstuno*^, however,
r<\& emrhaMs to this rnnsMeration In the pres
<r.t Issue: First, the nomination wax unsolicit
ed by me. and. second, the convention, as In
the case also of Its nominee for the President,
went out cf Its own political orcanizatlon to
select a candidate. To my mind, this action
of the Slous Falls convention In n"mlnftting
for President a representative of the IVmo
cratlc rarty and for Vice President a repre
sentative of the Silver Rej>ub!ican party ie
one of the most encouraging and in^plrin*
Fr"ectacleÂ» in re<-*>nt politics. Its unselfishness
end magnanimity. It* testimony to the prece
dence cf the cause or the people over any
merely partisan advantage, raised the pro
cedure cf that convention Into the serene upper
air of true rivl<- hÂ»r<i'.sm. Krrwn such a Fptrlt
as th'.F. what sen-Ice, what sacrifice can be
crkei in the r.arr.e of the republic. It was of
course the expectation ct your convention that
its nomination for the Vice Presidency would
jrm-e acceptable to the conventions of the
rwmocratic and Filver Republican parties called
-to mwt !n Kansas City on the Fourth of July-
The Silver Hr-publlcana, 1T,3O delegates, rep
rfsentltiir twenty-eight States and Territories,
were indeed ea*:er to name the ticket chosen
tt Pioux Kails, but to the great I^mocrat'c i
Convention another commended tteelf. The J
i:-. me at yeur nominee was prf s;utÂ»d to that j
convention and v as received with remarkable ,
riemor.stratJons of approval by the enormous
rumber of citizens and with the greatest
respect by the dtJf-irates. But geographical
cfmflderaticr.s an 1 the fact that in certain
parta of the country it was deemed wise m
defer to a f^ntiment that the candidate should â¢
|M a man already identified with th* I'emo
cratic onran'.zatton, not only by holding its
principles and advocating its cause, hut also
fiy name ar.d profession, determined the selec
tion of Adlal n. Stevenson of Illinois, a man
of unimpeachable character and of ripe politi
cal experience, who as a member of Congress
more than twenty years ago was a c\n$t> as
t.start and oo-iaborer of General J. B. Weav-r
end other frr~at leaders in the reform political
movement* at that day and who as a Vic*
prestdest fr> m ;sr<3 to l?:-7 distinguished hlm
t*if by r*bÂ«'ilin(? against the betrayal cf Den>
ocruti^ principles by President Cleveland.
In conclusii-r.. I may be permitted to express
the prottmaA satipfaotlon which I feel con
temjlating the present attitude of the Demo
crat)" j arty. In 1S^6 I was one of those who,
keenly iWlir.s the recreancy nf the Republican
j arty, were much In doubt whether the memor
able ! n-mocratic convention in Chicago In
adopting "t ?r''*ndid platform and nominating
N\'lliifttT! J. Hryan for the Presidency was ac
tuated bar an Impulse or by a purpoae. The

Tragic Outcome of a Suit for the
Hand of the Belle of
Bear Harbor. /
Special Dispatch to The Call.
COVELO, Aus. 7.â The traplc details of
a fatal affray between rival suitors at
Bear Harbor, a coast hamlet, reached
here by stage to-day. The principals in
the affray are Mattie Jensen. David
French and Benjamin Smith. French's
jealousy of Smith precipitated the quar
rel, and as a result French lies mortally
wounded with four bullets in his body,
while Smith is suffering from a serious
fracture of the skull received from the
iron bar in the hands of French.
It appears both men were rival suitors
for the hand of the young woman and
had been devoted in their attentions.
They were treated impartially and the
affection of Miss Mattie was equally di
vided. Both young men had proposed
n<arriage. but Miss Jensen had been un
able to choose between them. Both men
had been regular callers at the Jensen
house, though seldom If ever before both
appeared in the parlor together. Sunday
night last was Smith's visiting night, and
he was enjoying the society of his sweet
heart when a sharp knock at the parlor
door announced a caller. Smith opened
the door and was confronted by. French,
who asked that he might speak with him
a moment. Smith, not expecting any
trouble, unhesitatingly complied. The mo
ment he crossed the exit French struck
him a powerful blow with a heavy bar of
Iron, which prostrated him, and he fell
through the door Into the parlor in an
almost insensible condition.
Miss Jensen, when she noted the tide of
affairs, ran into an adjoining room and
procured a revolver and handed it to
Smith to protect himself. Smith instantly
grabbed the weapon and fired four shots
at French, all taking effect In vital parts
of the body. French is dying and Smith
is under arrest.

OAKLAND. CAL., August 7, 1900.
But in addition to the partisans of tho
two contending factions there is a large
mass of voters In Alameda County. It is
made up of men of tho better class and
of a high grade of Intelligence, and they
are the men who have an idea that the
County Clerk'* office is for the purpose of
conducting public business and not .for
a private campaign bureau.
Meanwhile the work of sending out cam
naisn literature and cards under ofllclal
Mr. Jordan Is equally particular to
Etate that whatever facilities he provided
for Henry P. Dalton this year he offered
to the managers of Mr. Metcalf, but he
has not expressed any opinion as to
whether they were* "smooth" enough to
take advantage of the offer.
So the County Clerk, despite his friend
ship for Mr. Metcalf two years ago and
his friendship for Mr Dalton this year,
asserts that he is Impartial in the use
of his office for "doing politics," and thai
the "other Bide" has always had an even
break at -the Great Register. And thus
the Alameda County Clerk's office be
comes an interesting study In the methods
of "doing" private politics without com
ing in dangerous conflict with the law.
So Mr. Jordan has succeeded In attract
ing to himself many of the bricks that
have been poised in the air ready for huri
lng at somebody ajid they are being hurled
fit the County Clerk. He has drawn tho
fire of both sides, for those who are using
him and his office to-day were against
him after the last primary, and those who
were, friendly to him then are against
him now.
At that time a series of long articles ap
peared in the Enquirer, which paper is
now supporting Jordan, attacking the
County Clerk for having issued certifi
cates, and particularly blank ones, over
the seal of his otilce and the signature of
his deputies.
These articles were signed simply, ine
Committee," and It waB inferred that they
were prepared by the campaign committee
<3f the defeated Congressman. They be
gan with charging the County Clerk with
Having issued fraudulent certificates, and
drew his denial. Then they charged that
blank certificates had been issued, and
this was met with a denial. Then those
who were preparing these articles and who
were having them published issued fac
similes of certificates issued by the Coun
ty Clerk, Including a blank certificate,
which had on it the seal of the County
Clerk and signature of J. B. Dean, one
of his deputies.
; As a result of these articles the name
I of the County Clerk was coupled in a
very unpleasant manner with the issu
ane'e of the documents, and Jordan's cer
tificates have f.one down into Alameda
County's political history.
So the tacts that were brought out at
the meeting of the Supervisors yesterday
were not altogether new. It was more
the fact that the County Clerk was con
fronted by his former friends as accusers
and that he was determined to threaten
them with the past in return for their
present charges that aroused interest.
The present condition of affairs is due
to the extreme bitterness that exists be
tween the factions in Alameda County,
and the high pitch of nervous excitement
to which the political managers have been
brought !n the last few weeks.
But bereft of its personal nature, the
matter simmers- down to the use of the
County Clerk's office for private political
ends. County Clerk Jordan took refuge
behind the statement that neither his acts
of two years ago for Victor H. Metcalf
nor his acts of the present year for Hen
ry P. Dalton were criminal, and his main
excuse was that whatever he did for one
6lde he had offered to do for j.he other
side.
Mr. Jordan was very particular to state
yesterday, and he Is very particular to
state to-day, that when he began the is
suance of the certificates for the Metcalf
managers two years ago he went to the
Hilborn managers and offered them the
6ame opportunity of issuing certltlcates,
but in the opinion of Mr. Jordan "Mr.
Hllborn's managers were not quite as
smooth as those of Mr. Metcalf."
The statements made by â¢ County
Clerk Jordan were not particularly
new. but It \*as the way In
which they were made and the con
ditions under which they were uttered
that made them of interest. The whole
matter was thrashed out a year and a
half ago. very shortly after Victor H.
Metcalf had been elected to Congress and
Frank C. Jordan had been elected County-
Clerk.
OAKLAND. Aug. 7. â County Clerk
Frank C. Jordan has succeeded in
turning the attention of the people
j of Alameda County from the Con
gressional contest to himself for a few
brief moments. By his actions of the last
few weeks and his statements before the
Board of Supervisors yesterday Jordan
has drawn attention to the manner in
which a County Clerk's office may be
used In doing politics.

While Out at Ocean Beach Photo
graphing the Life Saving Crew
She Is Overcome by
the Breakers.
Miss Rose Tompkins, a teacher in the
Hawthorne Primary School, died yester
day morning in the Receiving Hospital
ambulance while being removed from the
ocean beach for treatment.
Miss Tompkins left her home at 1000
Van Ness avenue early yesterday morn
ing, saying she was going to the beach
to got a picture of the life-saving crew.
That was the last Miss Tompkins' aged
mother saw of .her until she heard of
her sudden demise, all the particulars of
which were given by the life-savers.
From the facts gleaned from the llfe
pavinpr crew it would appear that the in
structress, Intent on securing a good pic
ture and heedless of her surroundings,
was overtaken by the rolling surf and
knocked down. The water swept over
her and left her wet and dripplner and
prone upon the sands. The shock was
apparently too great for the weakened
condition of Miss Tompkins" heart, and
being unable to rise, another breaker
rushing in carried the unfortunate woman
out to sea. , .
The life-saving crew saw tne wave
strike Miss Tompkins and rushed to her
rescue. Willing hands carried her out of
the water and conveyed her to a point
far up on the beach. However, as the
lady was unconscious and all the usual
restoratives failed to bring her to. an am
bulance was hastily summoned. While
being- conveyed to the Receiving Hospi
tal Miss Tompkins passed away.
Miss Tompkins had been a valued mem
ber of the school department since 1S81.
She leaves a mother past S3 years of age
and a sister, Mrs. Llllie Lehmann, now
in Germany. When the awful news of
Miss Tompkins' death was broken to her
aged mother the poor old lady became
hysterical and the worst results are
feared.
Miss Tompkins is the daughter of the
late Judge Tompkins and numbered
among her friends some of the most
prominent families of the State. She was
a schoolmate of Lady Hesketh. formerly
Flora Sharon, and the warmest relations
are known to have existed between them.
The late teacher's mother is a wealthy
woman and her sister. Mrs. I^ehmann. Is
a woman of vast means. Miss Tomp
kins, however, desired to be independent
and chose teaching as a means to that
end. She was about 45 years of age.

ttrcft. Murphy Is a hostler, employed at
the Presidio.
The woman went to the clinic to be op
erated uj>un and died on the operating
table from the t-ffects of the chloroform
administered. The autopsy by Morgue
fcurfTt-on Leland showed that Mrs. Murphy
fcaxi a weak heart and that the anesthetic
ehouid not have been administered to her.
Coroner Cole has set to-morrow mornlna
as the date lor the inquest. He said yes
terday that the physicians attending the
clinic had committed an act of impro
priety in deserting the body and making
no explanation to the Morgue deputies,
iind that he would make a thorouglTin
vestipation of the affair in order that hÂ©
rniEht be enabled to where the
blame lay.
Murphy was obliged to separate from
his wife several months ago because of
her dirsljiated way of living and she en
tered u;x'n a dissolute career.

bag containing 53000 worth of Jewelry and
about SUB or $14C In p-old. and in conse
quence every member of the Corona's
crer.- is in deep tribulation. Mrs. Pratt
eays she left her valuables in eta,teroom
2C on the steamer, but a full ToreÂ© of de
tectives and policemen has failed to find
any trace of the diamonds or money. The
cabin boys have all bfen subjected to the
Ignominy of being searched and the
ete^mer has been ransacked from end to
Â«nd. but no trace of the money or jewels
can be found.
Mrs. Pratt and her son left for home on

clnary tape. Ihe bag is said to have con
tained ISCmO worm oi diamonds and more
than 1100 in co:n. Tne bag was never re
moved from her person, but nevertheless
when the lady reached the Hotel Ploasan
ton It v.-ae gone.
The fact of the Io6s was speedily made
known to Dr. Kc-eney and he at once in
voked the aid of the entire police force.
Detective W'hittaktr was pent poet haste
to' Broadway wharf, but on his arrival
there he round the Corona had been
moved to the seawall. AVhluaker was
Joined by O.Hcer J. T. Edncr and they
hurried to the seawall only to tind that
the cabins had all been torn to pieces. A
vigorous jsearch vas made and every nook
and corner In the vessel was searched,
but r.ot a trace of the jewels could be
found.
Captain T. "Wallace, superintendent of
the Paciflc Cnr.st Steamship Company,
thinks Mrs. Prait lrst hor Jewels on the
way home. He says the boy who took
care of her room ha-Â« been known to him
lor fifteen years and that he is as honest
as the day is lor.gr. Detective Whittakfr
hns a clew and Is very mysterious, while
Officer Kinor U certain he will locate the
mining diamonds and earn much fame.
In tbe meantime Mrs. Pratt Is mourning
the loss of her treasure and Dr. Keeney Is
Invoking the aid of ex-Police Commission
Alvord in order to make the detectives
and police work overtime in order to dis
cover the whc-rcabnuis of the little linen
bag and Its contents.

California street, notary public: George
T. Knox and A. Wolf of this city.
Henry A. and I>aura Voorman and H. L.
E. Myer, the executors, appeared in Judge
Coffey's court yesterday morning and re
quested that special letters of adminis
tration be issued to Henry A. Voorman.
These letters were made necessary, it
was represented, because of an Important
contract that was to mature within a few
weeks. The letters were granted and M.r.
Voorman was placed under $50,000 bonds.
His sureties are Mrs. Alice Tilden and
Mrs. Viola V. Willett.
The balance of the estate, after deduct
ing that to be paid to the housekeeper, is
equally divided among the children and
frandchildren of the decedent. Henry A.,
da and Laura Voorman are to receive
one-sixth of the estate; Viola AVlllett,
wife of W. M. Wlllett. Is to receive one
sixth, less $15,000. which has already been
paid her; Alice Tilden, wife of II. O. Til
den, is to receive one-sixth, less $13,000.
which has alreadv been paid her; and the
grandchildren, Henrietta Dubols and
Henry Dubols, are to receive one-twelfth.
Henry Dubols' share is to be held by the
executors in trust, the bequest to be re
ceived when he arrives at the age of 31
years. In the meantime he shall be paid
the Income derived from his share.
The total value of the estate cannot be
learned until the liabilities have been ac
counted for. It is said to be in the neigh
borhood of $500,000. The estate consists of
large real estate holdings in various sec
tions of the State, stocks, bonds, cash in
bank and a number of minor personal se
curities.
A peculiar feature of the will of the late
Henry Voorman, filed yesterday for pro
bate by Attorneys Lloyd & Wood, is
that no mention whatever Is made of Mr.
Voorman's wife. It reems she has been in
a sanitarium for a number of years. The
children have looked after their mother
and have seen that she received good
care. No provision, however, was made
by Mr. Voorman for assisting his sick
wife; In fact, her name is not once re
ferred to in the will. To his housekeeper,
Mrs. L. G. Beckford, he bequeathed the
sum of $10,000 '"for her faithfulness, care
and attention." Mrs. Beckford has been
with the family a great number of years,
nursing ail the children In their infancy.
The Balance of the Estate, Which Is
Estimated to Be Worth $5OO,
000, Goes to His Chil
dren.
He Bequeaths $10,000 to His
Housekeeper, Mrs. L
Gr. Beckford.
