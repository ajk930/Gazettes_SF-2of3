ent, with the Imperial edicts as authority,
declares that as late as July 2 the im
perial Government urged the Boxers to
continue, their, "loyal, and patriotic ser
vices in exterminating the . Christians."
He explains those marvelous changes in
the Chinese, attitude which have feo puz
zled the world. It appears that all .the
appeals fcjr Intervention and all the pro
testations of friendship have been due en
tirely to the victories of the allies at Tien
tsin. The Ministers at Peking owed their
safety up to July 3inot to Government
protection, but to the scarcity of Chinese
ammunition and to the fear which the
Tientsin victories inspired.

BRUSSELS, Aug. 1. â The advance toward Peking has begun, ffl. de Favoreaux, Minister for Foreign Affairs, has received from the Belgian
representative at Taku an important dispatch, which states that the troops of the powers are already eighteen miles from Tientsin. It is cal
culated that they will complete the distance in eight days, whether the advance is opposed or not. Nothing was said as to the commander in chief.
I learn that the foreign Ministers also received information which shows that the. Ministers and other foreign residents of Peking are now
enjoying the'active protection of the throne, apparently at the invitation of the Chinese Government They have abandoned the legations and have
taken refuge in the sacred precincts of the Forbidden or Imperial City. ;
CHEFU, Aug. 1.-â From Tientsin under date of Sunday comes a report that the Japanese vanguard had been repulsed with a loss of 150 in
killed and wounded. The advance of the combined forces was fixed for August 1. The British alone were reported as being disciplined to advance
from Tientsin immediately. Other troops were expected to move on Monday. The Russians are said to have taken some forts ten iniles up' on the
Peking road, from which 10,000 Chinese troops fled.

[SUMMARY OF* CHINESE NEU/S.
AT last the veil which has for so long shrouded Peking
has been lifted, disclosing the responsibility of the Chi
nese . Government â "If there be one/' to quote Sir
Claude Macdonald â -for the tragic events of the .last seven
weeks.. ."
Simultaneously comes a report that the foreigners in
the capital have taken refuge in the forbidden city, which, if
true, would seem tfÂ» indicate that the imperial authorities
have at last awakened to a full realization of their duties and
their danger â a realization, doubtless, due to the advance of
the allied' forces from Tientsin.
The latest dispatches indicate that the relieving army
has already covered eighteen of the ninety miles of its march.
A messenger from Chefu reports the repulse of the Japanese
vanguard with heavy loss.
Captain Myers, commanding the detachment of the
United States marines in Peking, is mentioned for conspicu
ous bravery in several of the special dispatches published in
this morning's Call, and one of which, from Dr. Robert

says: Alexander Jester, the octogena

acquitted. The jury took three ballots.

It ivas filled with an expectant throng.
Eager faces bent forward and watched
closely every motion, of the twelve men
who were to decide the old man's fate.

ly addressed the foreman of the Jury, Jo
seph Barry, as soon as the jurymen had
taken seats and asked if they had come
to a conclusion. IJarry answered quietly
in the affirmative and handed the verdict
to the Judge. The latter calmly, unfold
ing the paper, scanned It a moment and
then read:
"We, the Jury, find the defendant. Al
exander Jester, r.nt pullty."
The old prisoner, bent with age and
worn with watching, sat as if dazed for
an instant, while the audience, at first
too amazed to realize that the trial had
so quickly come to an end. watched the
actions of the Judge In breathless silence
and seemed hardly to grasp the meaning
of the words just spoken. Jester, finally
realizing the Import of the words, arose
and, his face beaming with joy. moved
toward the jurymen to thank them. A
moment later the spectators awoka and
rave vent to their feelings in a shout that
made the courtroom ring. Then, with
common impulse, a rush was made for

' Klink Fails to Enlighten Toland.
Toland wanted . to know how it came
about: that there was such an.incraase in.
the operating *xpenses when there was a
decrease in Â¦ the' business. Klink replied
that it was hard to account for all' these
particulars, sinc&.the lines had consolidat
ed:: but a portion of the expense was due
to the relaying of the rails. t Â¦
; Toland was- still unsatisfied. He could
not see why the land expenses of Stw/JbO
should not have been deducted and. why
instead of a. deficiency of J12.3S5 there
should not have : been a showing of 5o2,Pi4
surplus, the $23>,000 sinkln-sr fund, he said,
should have been added and a â¢ surplus
shown of $282,000, which with the $53. ,30.
charges., as expenses for betterments,
would have left a grand surplus of $b20,22l,
instead oC a. deficit as; reported in the
statement of J1J.355. The interesting fact
was. disclosed that at least ten miles of

AUDITOR KLINK FAILS TO ENLIGHTEN THE BOARD OF EQUALIZERS AS TO SOME
OF THE STRANGE THINCS THAT APEAR IN REPORTS OF HUNTINGTON RAILWAYS
would produce the wildest confusion lq the
courts of the State.
The discussion of these questions bring j
the Secretary of State into the arena. He j
does not knov.- what to do. It is doubtful !
if Governor Gage, with the assistance of i
all the lawyers connected with the execu
tive branch of the Government, knows
just what course should be pursued to
meet the requirements of law. It id doubt
ful if the Attorney General, backed as he
is by a group of salary-loving statesmen,
can solve the question.
Another element intervenes "to compli
cate matters. There are three Judges to
be appointed for each of the three appel
late courts, making more judicial appoint
ments. The Governor is vested with the
appointing power, and for the nine places
there are already ninety-nine applicants,
and yer the amendment has not even been
submitted to the voters. Gossip goes that
Judge Sweeney of Shasta. Judge E. C.
Hart of Sacramento and Judge WÂ« C. Van
Fleet of San Francisco are already slated
for executive favor. The other six may
come from Los Angeles If Herrin con
sents and territorial limits do not inter
fere.
The aspirants for office do not want any
stumbling blocks in the way. They are
indeed anxious that only one amendment,
and presumably the one adopted at the
extra session, shall be submitted.
Great pressure has been brought to bear
upon the Attorney General to persuade |
him to adopt some plan of action to ob- i
tain an early judical determination of the ;
question. It is stated to-night that steps |
will be taken to enjoin the Governor and
Secretary of State from submitting to the
people the amendment to reorganize the
courts, which was adopted at the regular
j session.
At the extra session of the Legislature
Senator Cutter sought to have the action
of the regular session in this respect re
scinded, but he was not able to carry his
point. There was a strong sentiment in
the Senate against legislation on matters j
not embraced In the Governor's procla
mation.
The majority of the Senators, however,'
maintained that the work of framlnsr and I
submitting an amendment to the constitu- I
j tion was not legislation. It was also ad
i vanced that a Legislature could do any
[ thing it pleased without suggestion from
1 the executive department.

Martin, an : old-time conductor oh the
Southern Pacific, but recentlj' employed
on the Santa Fe route. iii the valley, was
shot and probably fatally wounded last
night by Captain A\ AVilllams, a well
known steamboat man. ;
The shooting occurred in the bar. room
at the Mineral Baths just oi*| of town.
There had been bad ; feeling between, the
men for ; several years, v which .. started
when Mar tin was .a conductor on the
Southern Pacific a number of years ago.
The men have not met often, but^ast night
about 11 o'clock, when Martin was stand
ing at the bar, Williams and another man
entered the room. The story of an,eye
witness is that Martin was standing with
his elbow on the " bar' when - Williams
passed him and said "Hello','- to one of the
proprietors. Then â¢ he * wheeled and com
menced shooting. He fired two shots and
Martin fell; In -his 'tracks.,, OnÂ© shot
glanced on his chin and a second went un"
der the heart and throupti the/tntestlnes.
\Vllliams walked out of the room, and
re-entering with a friend, walked up to
the bar close by the fallen man and took

SAC31AMENTO. Aug. Xâ The lbng
tlme friction between the State ex
ecuUve. and law departments: has
cuhnteated in an open break. AH
. sorts of ruTnors are In circulation
in the Capitol building. One report }s: to
the effect that a facetious letter written
by Private Secretary Foley to the Attor
ney General elicited a reply from the law
department wnlch aroused the wrath of
Governor Gage and Impelled him to send
a scorching communication to Attorney
General Ford.
The Controller's office and the executive
department have been at outs for a long
time. Shortly after Gage was inaugurated
the Controller paid his respects to the
chief magistrate and kindly volunteered
to furnish thk executive office with any
Information tnat the Controller was able
to eupply. The Controller was thanked
for the oSter, but was told nevertheless
that the Governor would hunt up for falm
pelf any Information that he might need.
This rebuff induced the Controller to re
tire to his own end of the Capitol build-
Ing .with anything but a high opinion of
the executive's notion of official courtesy.
After months had rolled by the Governor
eent to the Controller's office for a certain
book. The Controller put his foot down
firmly. Baying: "The book shall not go
out of the office. If the Governor wants
any information let him bunt It up for
himself." Since then therÂ© has been cold-

ahat can be ascertained to-night was a
Dundle of good excuses" for the failure
)f the law department to solve a question
Df law. The Attorney General was not
:hrown off "his balance and replied with
statesmanlike dignity to the Foley epistle.
Something in the reply must have nettled
fj*oley and caused the Governor to declare
limself in. The Call correspondent is in
'ormed that the Governor's letter to Fcrd
s anything but. facetious and Ironical. It3
receipt' caused the usually mild and placid
Attorney General to snort with wrath ami
declare openly that he could no longer
iiol4 any other than official relations with
the Governor. . â¢ ' ".Â¦' Â¦
.Deeper inquiry into the Underlying
pauses. of the controversy show that the
question at issue vitally concerns the peo
ple of California. It appears that the
Legislature, at the regular session in 1ST-3,
submitted a constitutional amendment
proposing to reorganize the Supreme
Court and create three appellate courts.
Later on the extra session of the Legisla
ture took up the same subject and submit
ted another' amendment. The extra ses
sion' amendment contains several more
'Â¦HCtlons than are embraced In the first
mehdment. The law question arises
w'hether the Legislature, called together
to legislate on special topics, could legis
late on subjects not embraced in the Gov
ernor's proclamation convening the legis
lative body. . : ' â¢ . . . â¢
' Again the law question arises as to.. what
shall be done with the amendment pro
posed at the regular session, provided the
extra session amendment is submitted.

Bladdsr troubles most always result from

can make no mistake by taking Dr. Kilmer's

It corrects inability to hold urine and scald-

unpleasant necessity of being compelled to

VANCOUVER. D. C, Aug. 1.â Fifty sal
mon fishir.R nets of a total approximate
vaiuf cf J^KKi were -destroyed last night
t>n the Frawr River. The nets were most
ly owned Iiy .'Japanese and were practi
cally nrw. having been in the water but
a fÂ»w days. ; .
.The white union fishermen, according
to. the reports at Sleveston this after
noon.' had made a combined attack on
the Japanese nshinp at the mouth of the
liver last. night and :he Japanese appear
to have got decided! v the worst of it.
All day the Japanese have been coming
to the police station with pieces of nets
and other broken wrecks that tell of dis
aster through the night.
Seven of the Japanese, representing two
large boats, had fights with the white
rnon. They found the whites cutting the
nets and tried to stop them. In the row
the Japanese were worsted. Ncne
were .badly hurt.liut it was reported that
in one mix-Dp a Japanese was thrown
overboard ami was not seen again.
Several police patrol boats went out thin
afternoon to try to make arrest*; among
the white fishermen. The concerted at
tempts on the part of the union men to
destroy the property^ of the Japanese
arose from a desire to revenge themselves
on thr Japanese deserting them in the re
cent'strike and fight with the canners
Lan night was very dark, and as the
Japanese sleep in their boats, especially
when there Is a llpht run of fish it was
easy for the white fishermen to come near
enough to slash the nets.

SACRAMENTO. Aug. l.-Mrs. Rachel
HambLr-n to-day brought suit against the
Southern Pacific Company for $50,000 dam
ages for the death of her husband, Jacob
J. Hamblen, through what she alleges
was the carelessness of the company.
On June 27 last Hamblen was driving
ecrops the R-street track at Twenty-Drst
street, when he was struck by a passing
locomotive and instantly killed. Some
years ago, after another such fatal epi
pode, the city authorities required the rail
road company to place signal bell.s at the
Twenty-lirst street and other intersec
tions, which would ring a warning as the
locomotive approached the crossings. It
is claimed that the bell at Twenty-first
street was out of order at the time Hamb
len was killed and that he had no warn
ing of the approach of the train, a large
billboard preventing a view of the track
below the point of crossing.

and asked if he should give himself up.
Witness asked him the nature of the
trouble, to which defendant replied: "It's
none of your business." Witness advised
him to go to San Frajicisco and surrender
himself in the morning if the trouble was
serious.
The case goes on to-morrow.
George M. Collopy, who conducted a
saloon at Colma, saw defendant about 3
o'clock in the afternoon of: December 24
at the former's place of business, -where
he remained about . an Â¦ hour > and a half.
Â¦When -he left -he went toward ;Lennon's
and was sober at the time. He saw him
again about. 7 or 7:30 o'clock, in the even
ing. At this time .defendant was; excitec\
and was , battered Â¦ about the face. De
fendant told witness : he Â¦ had ; had : trouble
The first witness called for the defense
was H. Q. Tilton, who testified that he
frequently saw defendant and deceased
together . and that they, appeared to be
the greatest of friends. Peter : Gillogly
testified to the same effect. '.Â¦â¢ Â¦Â¦-.>
The last witness examined for the pros
ecution was James L. Nunan, at whose
house in San Francisco Fitzgerald took
refuge after the homicide. Mr. Nunan
stated that defendant came to his place
between midnight and 1 o'clock ln the
morning of December 25 of last year, be
ing at the time in an excited condition.
His face was badly bruised and blood
was upon it. Witness asked him what
the trouble was, to which he replied: "I
have had some trouble and am afraid 1
have killed a man." He further stated
that he had shot a man and feared be
had hit him "in a soft spot." Witness
then asked him if he had killed Lennon,
but defendant refused to tell, saying to
wait until morning and he would read
about It in the papers. Defendant stayed
the balance of the night at witness' house.
Witness read an account of the killing in
the morning paper and went to wake de
fendant. He showed him â¢ the paper and
told him he was ln trouble. Defendant
then Inquired if Lennon was dead. \V't
ness told him he. was and advised him to
go to the City Hall and surrender him
self, which he promised to do after ho
had finished his breakfast. It was while
he was at breakfast that Sheriff Man j
field arrested him. . When asked if any
one was present at the time of the trouble
defendant thought that possibly O'Malley
was there, but was not certaJn.
McLaughlin testified to the same thing,
and said that when told of the killing a
short time after he had remarked: "Well,
I. see Fitz has done Â¦wnat he said he
would."
In order to disprove the theory of ac
cident advanced by the defendant at the
former trial Sheriff Mansfield, in the
presence of Chase Littlejohn and Distr ci
Attorney Bullock, made a number of ex
periments with the rille with which ihe
shooting was done. Defendant claimed
that he and Lennon both had hold of the
gun when it was discharged.. The testi
mony showed that there were rto powder
marks either upon the clothing of de
ceased or upon his body.
Sheriff Mansfield shot through clothing
similar to that worn by deceased placea
one, one and a half and two feet distant
from the muzzle of the gun, using, both
black and smokeless powder, and in each
case the cloth was badly powder burned,
and in one case was set on fire.
Two of these witnesses were Mrs. Lizzio
Carroll and John McLaughlin, the former
stating that on one occasion she met de
fendant in the hallway of the hotel run
by her mother, Mrs. Donovan, iLfter a
quarrel he had with i^ennon in the bar
room. He stated then that he was "going
to his room after a gun and would put
a bullet through the â â â ."
The District Attorney has produced
some new and strong evidence at thi3
trial, a number -of new witnesses having
been discovered in the time intervenint?
between the two trials.
Witnesses other than those produced at
the former trial testified to threats they
had heard Fitzgerald make against the
life of Lennon.
This was the third day of the trial and
the State this afternoon rested its cast,
after arranging to take the testimony of
one more witness as soon as the latter
should arrive, and then Mr. Boardman
outlined the defense in his opening state
ment to the jury, in which he admitted
the killing 1 of Lennon by defendant, but
claimed it to have been done ln self-de
fense.
REDWOOD CITY, Aug. l.-New evi
dence against Fitzgerald, undergoing a
second trial on the charge of having mut
dered Lennon at Colma on Christmas
eve last, was adduced by the prosecution
to-day and Sheriff. Mansfield has sub
mitted the result of tests in firing at
clothing at short range to disprove tho
theory of an accidental killing in a
scuffle.

The upper picture is that of the dead farmer, whose tragic death on his

Wheeler Baylos and his foster-brother.
Georpe W. Curtis, positively assert that
they have convincing evidence from the
trail of the strange footprints discovered
at the scene of the old man's death that
justifies tht-m in the strong suspicion they
have as to the midnight murderer. .'Â¦'â¢ .
The rifle from which the boys declare
the fatal shot was fired was a present to
Bayles from his son Wheeler.
"I bought it two years ago and sent It
to my father," said Wheeler to-day. "I
knew the gxm as soon as I saw it on the
grround near the grate, where I an con
vinced the murderer stood when he fired
the shot."
Bayles and Curtis will be compelled ic
go to Glencoe within a few days on busi

Bayles and Curtis have given a most ac
curate, and detailed description of the
footprints which form so important Â¦ a
feature of the case. They were fortunate
in that the soil around the ranch place is
of a soft red- gravelly nature, yielding to
impressions readily. Thf> prints were un
doubtedly, made by human feet encased
and Wrapped in some cloth covering, prob
ablv sacks. The impressions along the
trail : of prints are in many instances so
<-lear that the form of a shoe could be
.made' out. blurred, however, by a criss
cross, of hair-like lines, such as would be
left by the fabric of a grain snek.
"It was with the greatest case we traced
those mysterious footprints," said
Wheeler Bayles. "After we got the start
from -the place where Curtis picked up
the shell it was like following a beaten
path. The strangest feature of this trail
ing'was-the sudden and abrupt loss of
the trail ln the brush that covers the hill
side over which we believe the murderer
fled after the killing.
"Up- through the brush bits of the sack
ing tiber could be found sticking to the
Â«-h.irn. thorny thicket undergrowth.

who saw thf man going across the field,
satisfies us that the murderer headed over
the hills across Railroad Flats' road.

TWO SAILORS DROWNED.
NEW YORK. Aug. 1.â No such whole
sale raid of well-dressed men and women
has been recorded in the tenderloin un
der the present administration as that
which closed up the Tlvoll in West Thirty
fifth street to-night and landed 200 men
and women in the West Thirtieth-street
station. Several patrol wagons made trips
between the brilliantly lighted resort from
11:30 until midnight. Captain Thomas and
forty of his men made the raid. The place
was full, an orchestra was playing and
waiters were serving drinks when the
captain and his men in uniform entered.
At once mor.e men in plain clothes?, who
had been scattered around at the tables,
drinking with the women, sprang to their
feet and displayed their shields.
Men swore and women screamed. Many
to whom a police raid was not a new
thing resigned themselves philosophically
to the inevitable and begged only that the
policemen handle them carefully. All the<
women were arrayed, in expensive sum
mer finery and sleeveless and low-cut
bodices of almost transparent material
were the rule. Many wore diamonds and
much jewelry.
Captain Thomas went through the place,
which Is a large hall, luxuriously fitted
up, and arrested everybody except the one
man most Â¦ desired â Ackron, the proprie
tor. Ackron has kept out of the Jurisdic
tion of the police for three or four days,
ever since he learned that a warrant lor
assault was out for him.
Chief Devery announced early in the day
"that the Tivoli must be closed" and the
raid was not unexpected. The women
were nervous all the evening and several
of the more hardened of the tenderloin
habitues kept close to the door all night.
Others who had received no Intimation of
the general demand for the Tlvoli's sup
pression â a demand which the police at
last have complied withâ were taken un
awares. These women were the ones who
screamed and wept.
Fairy Tales Told.
Many of the male prisoners were evi
dently prosperous business men of middle
life. All sorts of false names were given
at the police station.
The raid was the most theatrical ever
made in the tenderloin. Old timers all
said so. Captain Thomas marched at the
head of his men up Seventh avenue to
Thirty-fifth street and then to the door
of the place so sharply that no one had
time to run in and warn the crowd. The
captain left ilve detectives and a. rounds
man at the doors and exits and then en
tered. In almost no time word spread all
over the Broadway and Sixth avenue dis
trict and Thirty-nfth street, between
Sixth and Seventh avenues, was packed
with people when the patrol wagons start
ed on their trips.
The nrisoners were greeted with derisive
hoots and yells. Another crowd number
ing 1000 gathered around the police sta
tion. Captain Thomas' entrance was dra
matic. He was in full uniform, and when
he had marched his men inside he took a
position in the middle of the hall and
glared around him for a full minute.
Everybody was scared, and when the cap
tain had satisfied himself of this he ex
claimed theatrically, "Every man and
woman in this place Is to consider himself
or herself under arrest."
Moment of Wild Uproar.
Bedlam broke loose as soon as the cap
tain had finished his declamation, and
screams and yells of terror, some real and
some simulated, filled the place.. Many of
the women tried to faint and a few suc
ceeded, and the men who had "just
dropped In to see what the place was like,
don't you know." looked sheepish enough.
The women, nearly all of them expen
sively attired, were taken to the wagons
first. There were fifty-four of them, and
many had never before been under arrest.
Some wept, others screamed, but the
crowd cheered derisively as they were
driven away. At the Tenderloin station
their pedigrees were taken and they were
locked up.
Three well-dressed couples, apparently
respectable, who said they were married
and were seeing the sights, were permitted
to go free after close questioning. De
tective Clennon won the plaudits of the
crowd in the street when he escorted a
pretty Salvation Army lass with a bundle
of War Crys, to the door and bade her de
part in peace.
It took several trips of the wagons to
carry the men prisoners to the police sta
tion. There were 154 of them, all ages
and conditions, many of apparent refine
ment and respectability.
Names and addresses were taken at the
station and after Captain Thomas had
given warning that he would hold them
if caught again, they were permitted to go.
After a hearing extending over several
weeks Judge Daingerfleld yesterday

GRASS' VALLEY, Aug. 1.â Tuesday
night's fire besides destroying $150,000
worth of property is directly responsible
for one death, at least. J. W. Lufkin
was instantly killed by coming in contact
with a live wire this afternoon.
Lufkin was engaged with a crew of men
in fastening wires to a pole in the burned
district. Suddenly a hum was heard from
the wires and Luf kin's body was seen
lying across the wires and flames shooting
from all parts of his body and from th^
instruments with which he worked A
fellow workman grabbed Lufkin and pull
ed him off the wires. Three doctors work
ed on him. but without avail. Five thou
sand volts had passed through his body.
No human being could survive such a
shock.
How Lufkin came In contact with the
wire is not known. He was strapped to
the pole and engaged in lapping joints.
An examination of his body showed that
his left thumb and ear must have formed
a circuit. How the current came to be
on is a mystery to the Electric Power
Company. Mr. Hancock, superintendent
of the company in Grass Valley, says the
current was turned oft all day and was
not turned on by any employe of the
company, to his knowledge.
J. XV. Lufkin was from Nevada City,
where he has been in the employ of the
Electric Power Company for a number
of- years. He* was 32 years of age and
leaves a widow and two small children.
BIG RAISIN DEAL
IN FRESNO COUNTY
Colonel Forsyth Arranges to Pur
chase the Entire Crop of A. B.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO, Aug. 1.â The biggest raisin
deal in the history of the county has been
arranged between A. B. Butler and Col
onel William Forsyth, the latter purchas
ing the former's entire crop for a sum
approximating $40,000. Forsyth was at
one time in the raisin packing business
with Butler and for the last four yÂ»ars
the complications which grew out of "the
partnership have been the subject of liti
gation between them. The litigation is
not entirely settled yet and the announce
ment of such an important business deal
between them has created a good deal ot
surprise.
The Butler crop this year will make
4000 tons of green grapes, according to the
best estimate. If this whole quantity
were dried It would make about 1000 loiia
of raisins, or 100 carloads. Colonel For
syth intends, however,. to cure onlv about
three-fourths of the crop, or seventy-five
cars. In addition to that he will have
this year the crop on his own place and
that on two other ranches that he con
trols this year. Mr. Forsyth is not a
member of the packers' combine and But
ler does not belong to the growers' com
bine. This may lead to complications be
fore the deal is completed;

Lieutenant von Krohn was asked about the statement of a German that the
Russians had dispatched the wounded with the butts of their rifles. The lieu
tenant said it was not quite so bad as that; but under the circumstances of the
present war In China they had been and probably would in future be compelled
to kill the wounded with the bayonet. In the beginning they had even sent tho
wounded ta the hospitals in Tientsin, but they soon found out that as long as a
man was able to raise a hand he would try to stab the foreigners, and as, more
over, they found the prisoners very refractory and had all they could attend to
themselves, they had been compelled to kill all wounded with bayonets and,
generally speaking, accept no prisoners, but kill everybody who. stoÂ«d up against
them. Frequently they found Boxers who had taken their red badges and clothes
off in the hope of trying the "amigo" trick on them/and while the trick worked
at first the allies soon gave orders to kill every Chinese who would stand. The
Chinese in turn decapitate and mutilate every foreigner who may be wounded or
killed and who is unfortunate enough to fall into their hands.. On one occasion
a large number of Boxers succeeded in encircling an Italian officer with eight
men,' and while four of the men cut their way through the other four and the
officer were simply overwhelmed by the numbers and literally hacked to pieces
with the long knives of the Boxers: When Lieutenant von Krohn afterward saw
the body of the Italian officer, 'the head was split Into four pieces and his entire
body cut up.
"We did not take prisoners," said Lieutenant Krohn. "As far as the capture
of prisoners is concerned, this was an impossibility, as the Chinese are not civil
ized for that kind of warfare."
Asked what the Chinese did with their -women and old men. Lieutenant von
Krohn said they emigrated with all speed, but if this was not possible, as In the
case of one village taken by the allies, they cut off the; heads of the women and
children and threw them In the river. On the allies Went" until they reached Slu- ,
kiao arsenal across the river. Here a thousand halted^ for the others \behlnd.
They tried to parley, but the Chinese fired big guns," followed by rapid fire. The
gunners fought well, many being wounded, among them Lieutenant Krohn.
Finally orders were given to storm. The British engineers tried to take it. but
failed. Reinforced by the Germans, they charged again *and took it. Immense
numbers of guns and munitions of war were found. Six thousand Chinese had
held the fort. The allies garrisoned the fort and' prepared to make a stand
there until relief arrived, but after a stay of four days. Admiral Seymour having
come to the conclusion that in case a larger force attacked them they would not
be able to hold.it, they decided to destroy it and move on. Consequently, as they
were unable to take any of the guns along the engineers prepared an explosive
charge and the next night at about 2 o'clock they saw it burn and explode.
Shortly afterward they were relieved by forces from Tientsin.
"Everything went pretty well until the column reached Langfang, where the
railway was found destroyed. They had then to leave the cars and the wounded
were placed on junks on the river and the march backward along the river be
gan. Up to then they had only been opposed by Boxers, but soon regulars armed
with the latest patented rifles also opposed them. On account of the wounded
they had to march along the river and storm every village in their path. One
day seven were taken, the next six, working and fighting from 3 a, m. to 8 p. m.
The Chinese used smokeless powder and their position could not be found. The
villages were finally taken and burned down."

until he gets to China,
"Has your mission anything to do with
a mediation policy?" was asked.
"Really I cannot answer that. But I
think it safe to say that the President 13
not giving much thought to mediation or
indeed to any measure at all until he has
more definite information," was the an-
SWt r.
In reply to a question as to whether his
report would deal with the identity of tha
murderous hordes Mr. Rockhill said that
he expected to send to America every
thing that was of importance in the pre's
ent situation.
Of Li Hung Chang the Commissioner
thinks highly. "He is the only native in
China to-day who thoroughly understands
European affairs and customs," he said.
The present Commissioner is by virtue
of years of. experience in the country for
which ho is bound the right man in the
right place. Going to China in 1S81 as sec
ond secretary of the Peking Legation, in
a year he had raised himself to the posi
tion of first secretary. In 1SS8 he returned
to America, after having resigned his
consular position to make a tour of In
vestigation through China in the Inter
ests of the Government. In 1SS3 he re
turned - f to the. Orient, traveling, 1 through
Western and Central China for the Smith
sonian Institution. From 1803 to 1S97 the
diplomat served as United States Consul
to Greece. This position he resigned to ac
cept the directorship of American Repub
lics, which office he held when the Chinese
difficulties began.
"My mission Is simply to report on con
ditions in China at the present time," said
Mr. Rockhill last nipht. "I hope that my
work will soon bo finished and that 1 shall
be able to return to Washington to resume
my regular duties." r ,
The only nation besides the United
States to send a Commissioner to report
on the F.tate of affairs is Great TJritajn,
whose representative is Sir Walter Hill
yer, Mr. Rockhill is extremely reticent as
to the object of his expedition, claiming
that he does not know what that will be
Mr. Rcckhill denies the rumor that he
is to be appointed Consul if Conger is
found to have been killed.
The Commissioner will sail to-morrow
for China on the America Maru and will
be met on his arrival at Shanghai by Con
sular Clerk Hubbard Smith, who is at
prer-ent acting Consul at Canton. Hub
bard Smith will serve as secretary under
Mr. Rockhill. Shanghai has been select
ed by Mr. Rockhill as his headquarters.
"W. TV. Rockhill, United States Commis
sioner to China, accompanied by Mrs.
Rockhill, arrived here yesterday from
Washington, en route to the Orient. Mr.
Rockhill's mission is to report on condi
tions at the theater of war to the Presi
dent and Secretary of State Hay. To en
able him to do this the executive commit
tee of the Bureau of American Republics
has excused Mr. Rockhill from his duties
as director of that department. .

Aug. 1.â The Kentucky
State Populist Convention (middle of the
road) to-day nominated for Governor O
H. Cardcn of Cnttenden County, and also
nominated Presidential electors. The plat
form indorses the Omaha and Cincinnati
declarations; indorses Barker and Donnel
ly; denounces the Republican party for
"cruel capitalism," and the Democratic
party as "the servile imitator of the Re
publicans In all the villainous legislation
of the past thirty years"; declares im
perialism "is a sham battle between the
two old parties to obscure real issues"
denounces restrictions upon the ballot in
various Southern States, and especially
the Goebel election law in KentucKy, and
declares for initiative and referendum
Sections denouncing as criminal both the
Democratic and the Republican adminis
tration of affairs In Kentucky were
stricken out. This was not done, however
without a strong opposition from Jo a'
Parker, who had drafted the platform and
wanted it all adopted. . The tangle over
the platfoim took place under a big syca
more tree on the banks of the Ohio River.
The convention was held at River View
Park, and 125 delegates, representing all
the Kentucky Congressional districts
were present.

RESORT IN NEW YORK
Government of Nicaragua has taken pos
session of the property of ' the Maritime
Canal Company and removed the com
pany's cars and rails and property to the
interior from Grey town under article 54 of
the concession.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 1.â The seizure of
the property of the Maritime Canal Com
pany has long been expected. Under the
terms of the concession the Nicaragua
Canal Company was allowed a period of
ten years after the completion of the pre
liminary surveys in which to complete the
construction of the canal. That period
expired nearly two years ago.
The Nicaraguan Government, foreseeing
the failure of the company to comply with
the letter of its contract, entered into an
other arrangement with what was known
as the Cragin-Eyre syndicate to take up
the original concession promptly upon its
expiration. The Nicaragua Canal Com
pany, or rather its successor, the Maritime
Canal Comparny, was notified that the
Nicaraguan Government had vacated its
concession and Intended to seize upon its
properties according to the terms of the
concession. The canal company protested
and appealed j to the Government of the
United States on the strength of an arti
cle in the concession providing that
"should events of main force arrive, duly
justified and sufficient to impede the reg
ular progress of the work during a period
of the ten -years an ' extension shall be
granted," etc.
The company claimed that this contin
gency had arisen, and asked for the ex
tension referred to. The last article of
the convention provides that in the event
of a misunderstanding between the-Gov
ernment of Nicaragua and the company
the dispute should be submitted to four
arbitrators, two to be selected by each
party. The company, upon the refusal of
its claim by the Nicaraguan Government,
demanded this arbitration. The Nicara
guan Government admitted the justice of
the demand, but required that all four of
the arbitrators should be native Nlcara
guans. The company refused to commit
its interests to the care of such agents
and United States Minister Merry, at the
instance^ of the State Department, inter
vened in its favor. It appears now that
the arbitration had failed, as, the Nicara
guan Government claims, by the expira
tion of the period allowed for its work
the Government has proceeded to make
the seizure of the canal company's prop
erty.
The State Department has not yet been
notified of this action and when it is will
probably take some steps to ascertain
what motive influenced the Nicaraguan
I Government.

that owing to the existence of three frag
mentary budgets. he was unable to con
elude at what the Government ligrured the
cost of the war. ' He estimated that it
will be nearer Â£S0,OVt,0QV than Â£60,^00.000.
Sir William added that statesmen of the
higrhest authority were Impressing upon
the British the fact that they are the best
hated people in the world. Lord Salisbury
could not understand the reason, but Lord
Rosebery knew the cause of this hatred. !
Lord Kn<=eberry had declared the empire
needed peace. The last twenty years Great
Britain had been laying hands with ;
almost frantic eagerness on every desir
able tract of territory adjacent to its own.
This Rreed exceeded envy and stood in the
way of domestic reforms. %

figures were complicated, but he would

FACING BOTH WAYS.
SENATOR JONES, chairman of the Demo
cratic National Committee, after a conference
in New York with a number of the leading men
of his party, announced in an interview that the
Democrats of New York are not as harmonious as
they might be, but that they will unite in supporting
the national ticket on the issue of anti-imperialism.
He is quoted as saying:
"Mr. Bryan believes and the Democratic platform
says that imperialism is paramount, because the peo
ple are most interested in seeing the military and
expansionist policy of the present administration
ciushed." -li Â¦'.'.-Â¦:
There are other people who believe that "imperial
ism" is the isÂ«ue. A good many of them live in Colo
rado, and it appears that some of those who do are
in favor of the thing. Consequently, Bryan's friends
in thai State are afraid he will lose a portion of the
free-silver vote because silver is not the issue this
time. To meet that danger a declaration has been
made that, imperialism or no imperialism, if Bryan be
elected the free coinag^ of silver at 16 to 1 will be
forthcoming in these United States as sure as
shooting.
As an illustration of the way the game is working,
it is to be noted that Thomas M. Patterson, a Demo
crat of note in Colorado, is quoted by the Denver
Times as saying recently:
"It is not true that the Senate 'is an impregnable
stronghold of the money ring: it is not true, that the
allied silver forces cannot capture the House; it is not
true that Mr. Bryan, as President, would be helpless
unless he had Congress with him. By carrying for
silver only those States which voted for it in ; 1896 the

If other Police Judges follow the example of Judge
Conlan in-punishing poolsellers with heavy fines the
game will become expensive enough to be included
in that category of luxuries which are not needed in
our business. .
The astounding actions of Li Hung Chang indicate
that the wily old Chinese manipulator considers that
duplicity is the only art of statesmanship. Li's middle
name sounds highly suggestive' to those who do not
take kindly to his principle of statecraft.
The friends of Chief of Police Sullivan have no rea
son to protest that he is not the very essence of punc
tuality in paying the debts tff his political master. It
was natural that those who look upon political' prizes
as personal property should have awarded the police
property clerkship as the first plum.
While the local Board of Education is throwing
the School Department into a state of widespread
demoralization by wholesale consolidations, transfers
and degradation of teachers from their positions it
would-be wise for the members of the board to re
member that a reign of brief authority is frequently
ended by retribution.
Phil Crimmins, notorious by his activity in various

REVISED FIGURES OF
ASSESSED VALUATION
That the board is receding in a meas
ure from' its policy of wholesale consoli
dation, is evidenced from the notice which
It sent out yesterday to principals to de
lav finals classification and "consolidation
of classes until after the meeting of prin
cipals to be held at the City Hall on Fri
day afternoon at 1:45 o'clock. It is under
stood that a modification of its classifica
tion rule will be promulgated at that
meeting. ,, . .Â«<
; interesting developments are looked for
when the principals receive the circular
containing the order of the Superintend
ent for an enrollment not to exceed forty
five pupils, and it Is almost' certain that
the courts will be asked to decide the dis
puted point. Should the principals* follow
the orders of- the Superintendent- the
Board of Education -will go to law,, and
educators acquainted with the situation
say it will lose in the controversy with
Superintendent Webster.
Webster says further that the excuse
offered by Director Denman that consoli
dations are necessary owing to an appro
priation of $81,000 less this year than last
Is not borne out by the facts.
. "We have $1,160,000 to spend^' says Web
ster. "The teachers' salaries, will run
about $S0,000 per month and the cost of
administration $2173 per month, which
leaves a small balance. It were best to
use this than to- overcrowd
classes, which will only result In impaired
efficiency." , . Â¦ '
Superintendent of Schools "Webster
means to assert the prerogative vested in
him by the Political Code in the matter
of grading and classification of schools.
That official sfated yesterday that he
would issue an order to-day to the prin
cipals of schools annulling the classifica
tion schedule recently adopted by the
Board of Education calling for an enroll
ment of fifty-live pupils in the first and
eighth grades. Mr. Webster presented a
schedule at Tuesday's special meeting of
the board' directing that those classes
shall consist of not less than thirty nor
more than forty-five pupils. From the
second to the seventh grades classes shall
consist of an enrollment of 'not more
than lifty nor less than forty pupils.
Webster presented the above as his or
der, but the board took no action, it be
ing received in silence.
Nevertheless Superintendent Webster
has fortified himself with the. State law
and claims that the charter doea not give
the board power to grade or classify
schools, so that the power is vested in
him alone. The school manual says: "The
Political Â¦â¢ Code places the grading of
schools in the hands of the County Su
perintendent. No one can interfere with
his legal discretion in the matter, and
whether the schools be designated as pri
mary or grammar is left to his discre
tion."

not be rescinded, notwithstanding the

last Tuesday afternoon. It was then rep
resented that the transfer of the pupils
would cause great inconvenience on ac
count of the distance from the homes of

without avail.

of giant proportions, while Jones was of

Both gentlemen changed their tune yes

COULTER'S VIEW OF THE WHALE AFTER THE SAN RAFAEL PASSED
OVER IT. } , <
About the most interesting feature of this raw talk
is the revelation that while the Democrat Herrin is
running Republican politics in this district, the Re
publican factors in the "we" are going to do Demo
cratic politics in the Second. For that information
the people of the Second District will doubtless be
thankful. There are some blatherskites whose talk is
tiresome, but Lynch is not one of them. His babbling
gives confirmation to the story that in this campaign
the bosses of all parties are being used by the railroad
to control the election for railroad purposes. The
Republican party will not be injured by such state
ments as those we have cited. On the contrary, the
report of such, a combination will have the effect of
rousing even indifferent Republicans tot* sense of the
danger of the situation, and as a consequence the con
ventions of the party will be controlled By good and
Io3'al men, who will not take orders from "we." To
that extent Mr. Lynch's display of raw is serving a
good purpose, and we trust he will neither shut his
mouth nor tie his feet.
In the meantime, it will be worth while for the
public to give some heed to this chatter, senseless as
it sounds. Lynch has declared that in the Second
Congressional District "we" are going to nominate
Woods of Stockton in place of Forbes, and "we talk
of giving the Democratic nomination to Caminetti
instead of Sproul." To those two specimen state
ments may be added the farther one that Crimmins
and Kelly are not factors of the "we," but are working
with the combination and are going to be "recog
nized."
Lynch is paid by the Government to attend to pub
lic business in this Internal Revenue District, but he
prefers to do other things. It is pleasant to a man
of his kind to go about declaring in advance of all
conventions what we are going to do. Possibly Col
lector Lynch may have sense enough to know that
kind of thing don't pay in the long run, but having his
official salary he is perhaps content with that and is
doing "we" politics for thejfun of the thing. ,
The combination is curious: An Oregon Democrat,
a Mexican "what is it" and a Collector on the half
shell. These constitute the "triangle out of which
there is to come the political music that will beat the
band. There is nothing small" about Mr. Lynch's
menu. 'He and'his "we" intend to run politics, not
for one district, or one party only, but for all parties
and the whole State. He informs all whom it may
concern that we intend to give the Republican nomi
nation to this man and the Democratic nomination
to that man. He advises his friends to "get in with
us." He denies that Crimmins and Kelly have any
influence with "we," but concedes that "we" intend
to take care of them.
â¢ The Collector has been going about talking much
of what- "we have decided." The "we" does not in
clude the Republican party, the Democratic party,
nor the Populist party. It does not even, like the
Kaiser in Coghlan's famous song, form a combination
of "Meinself und Gott." The "we" of Collector
Lynch is merely Lynch, Herrin and Burns.
JOHN C. LYNCH, Collector of Internal Revenue
for this district, is one of the kind of politicians
who believe that the possession of Federal office
and the favor of the Southern Pacific Company entitle
them to the privilege of "doing politics in the raw."
Mr. Lynch does not wait for anything to cook. He
dishes out the menu red from the slaughter-house,
and demands that it be chewed, swallowed and
digested in that condition.
POLITICS IN THE RAW.
John C. Lynch, the truculent Collector of Internal
Revenue, who appoints a Denriery at the command of
Burns and turns messenger boy and tout for William
F. Herrin ought to be made to feel that officials may
disgrace themselves, but not their office. Partisan
ship can become not only offensive but insulting.

IN MIDDLE OF BAY WHALE
AND FAST FERRY-BOAT MEET
There you have it. In-New York the cry is that
the money question is settled; that Bryan, even .if
elected, could not overthrow the sound financial
legislation of the Republican party; that the one issue
is to crush the expansionist policy of the administra
tion. In Colorado the cry is everything for free silver,
and that if Bryan be elected he can establish, the
Populist money system, "even though Congress be
opposed to him." V
Were the American voters unable to read perhaps
such tactics might be dangerous; but as it is, they will
le^d only to the disrepute of those who try t 1 Â¦mi.
The Colorado voters will learn what is said about
silver by Bryan's supporters in New York, and the
New York voters will learn what his supporters in
Colorado are saying of it. Out of that knowledge
will come a confirmation of the popular distrust al
ready felt toward the windy man of Nebraska. The
only plea for Bryan that ever won any sympathy
among the people of the United States was that he
is a sincere man; honest, though mistaken, in his con
victions, and entitled to the respect due to honesty.
Now, when he is seen to be the artful dodger of poli
tics, juggling issues to suit his needs in different
States, he will lose even that respect. A man may
ride two horses, but if they be going in different
directions he cannot ride them very long.
gold majority in the .Senate would be reduced to two.
The gold standard was forced upon the country by a
gold standard 'President in the face of a Congress op
posed to it, and it can be forced off the country by a
silver President, even though Congress be opposed
to him."
There is every evidence that that is the attitude of
the Gold Democracy, and a majority of the anti-ex
pansionists. Of the latter no doubt a majority will
be found in the Republican party, for Mr. Bryan's
support in the South is imperialist to the core.
Mr. Morton concludes that there is nothing in
Bryan's record or his platform to commend him to
anti-imperialists^and asks: "Why, then, should those
who oppose imperialism and militarism favor the
election of Bryan over McKinley? As the record of
neither can be indorsed from the standpoint of the
anti-imperialist, would it not be better to aid in elect-*
ing the one whose position on the currency question
is sound, and whose election would not endanger the
stability of business Â£nd the commercial interests of
the country?"
. Confirming the title was one of the conditions of
the contract with Spain. When Mr. Bryan makes
the islands independent, does he intend that they
shall be so independent as to confiscate this property,
the title to which was guaranteed in the treaty for
which he lobbied? Mr. Bryan's infirmity is that he
never learned to look before leaping. He was instru
mental in ratifying a treaty that he now denounces.
When he comes to carry out his theory of the flag
and the constitution and finds its inevitable conclusion
to involve the secession of territory and the dissolu
tion of the Union, will he go ahead or will he flinch
again from the consequences of his own theory, as he
has from the treaty of Paris?
Having advocated the treaty, how will he dispose of
the international responsibilities which it involves?
To be plain, that treaty confirms the title to the
church property in the islands, which the Filipinos
desire to confiscate.
How is he to donate this stable form of govern
ment? How can a government conferred from the
outside be consistent with government by consent
and independence? Suppose they don't want Colonel
Erj-an's stable government, what will he do about it?
How is he going to give it to them? By what au
thority will he pursue that plan in territory that, by
his own theory, is under the flag and the constitution?
If he find authority for it, does it not also cover the
same course with South Carolina, or any other part of
our domain?
He now says: "We favor an immediate declaration
of the nation's purpose to give the Filipinos a stable
form of government; second, independence, and third,
protection from outside interference."
Yet when it looked as if there were votes in a
change of front he about faced from his attitude in
support of the treaty and began to denounce the buy
ing of the Filipinos at ?2 per head!
Not then, nor for months, a year afterward, was
Colonel Bryan heard to denounce the Philippine
affair. Republican papers which foresaw the train of
distress and difficulty to follow, as did The Call, op
posed the purchase.
As Mr. Morton says, he did not ask whether the
Filipinos were being sold for $20,000,000 by their own
consent or not; he was for the treaty. When Senators
Hoar, Hale, Wellington, Mason and other Republi
cans had the treaty beaten for the purpose of amend
ing the Philippine purchase .out of it, Colonel Bryan
was dragging in enough Democratic Senators to
ratify it against Republican opposition. He was in
fact a lobUyist for the treaty, and is more responsible
for its ratification than any other man in the United
States.: He knew, as all the world did, that the day
the vote was taken the Filipinos were in open revolt
against the authority of the United States. He knew
that they did not consent to the treaty nor to any
consequence following its ratification. Yet he secured
its ratification by Democratic votes. Therefore, if, in
the language of his platform, "to impose upon any
people a government of force is to substitute the
methods of imperialism for those of a republic," he,
by imposing the treaty upon the protesting Filipinos,
was an imperialist.
Hon. J. Sterling Morton, Gold Democrat and anti
expansionist, has keenly reviewed Bryan's platform,
and- position. When the treaty of Paris was com
pleted and ready for ratifying action by the two
Governments, Colonel Bryan was with his regiment,
and about to be ordered to Cuba. He had urged the
Spanish war, but suddenly turned to sweet dreams of
peace. = He resigned his commission and appeared in
Washington and elsewhere as an advocate of the
treaty and its ratification.
WE have heretofore pointed out the inconsist
ency of the Democratic platform on- expan
sion. It declares that the constitution follows
the fiag. The treaty of Paris put the flag in the Phil
ippines, therefore by parity of reasoning it put the
constitution there. But the platform further declares
that the Philippines must be alienated. Yet we set

represents roughly the Campanile and

hack states that, when borrowed by Da

Shakespeare chair. That the comfort of
children entered at that time into the con
sideration of furniture makers Is shown
by the carved high chairs belonging to
Shakespeare's and I Cromwell's grand
daughters.
The upholstered chair Introduced from
Venice in the time of James I came Into
general use in the latter Dart of the seven*
teenth century- By seeking thus to enrich
furniture; with costly brocade vei re is and
embroideries, upholsterers lost : sight of
the constructive beauty; rendered Invisi
ble by, the sumptuous coverings. As a
consequence, In spite of the beautiful In
lay of Boulle and the rich lacquer work of
, Vexnls Martin, there was a distinct de- .
Spaniards who had worked In \the stu
dios of the great masters of the renais
sance availed themselves of the great na
tional wealth: precious woods from In
dia and metals from South America, eb
ony, ivory and tortoise shell enabled
cabinet makers to indulge their taste for
luxurious furnishings and to produce
unique examples of fine workmanship.
Artisans from Italy. Flanders and France
were summoned to Spain by the great
Charles V, who boasted that the sun
never set in his dominions. ' Despite his
great wealth, his eminently practical turn
of mind is. evident by his sedan chair.' the
simple construction of which was perfect
ly adapted to its Ose. in striking contrast
to the ridiculously ornate vehicle of the
time of Louis XV.

singin? of Rreat artists,' but he waÂ«i
doomed to disappointment. Three society
ladles occupied seats in front of him and
their tall hats completely hid the sta^o
from his view. The doctor wished them
in San Francisco and elsewhere, but he
was . no magician. To add to his .cup of
sorrow, the ladies hel Â£â¢ animated conver
sation during the finest passage of tha
opera.
Th* next day he met the editor of t>><9
leading Journal of Milan and poured hi3
woes into the scribe's ears. The doctor
was not only pained that such things
wfre tolerated but was shocked. He ex
panded on his high-hat ordinance, and the
tditor was so profoundly impressed wttii
the law as it existed In this city that he
invited Dr. Rottanzi to become a mem
tor of the Town Council. The latter nar
rfcwly escaped being honored by taking a
hasty departure from that city.
The doctor has been absent from this
city for more than eighteen months. Dur
ing his stay abroad he devoted his time
to studv and the practice of his profes
sion. He attended the lectures and clinics
given by the leading universities of Eu
rope and derived much benefit. The doc
tor visited the Paris Exposition and was
greatly disappointed at the exhibit of this
country. He said that bankrupt Spain
and little Bulgaria's . exhibits surpassed
that of America. The doctor said the ex
hibits of this country were very fine and
proved to the world that our manufac
tories surpassed other countries, but the
barnlike building in which they were sit
uated showed them off to poor advantage.
Dr. Rottanzi is out of politics. Nothinff
could Induce him to . enter the political
arena again, now that his high-hat ordi
nance is working so nicely. He will de
vote his time to the practice of his pro
fession.
Author of the Famous Ordinance Re
turns From Abroad After a
Year's Absence.
Dr. Rottanzl, ex-Supervisor, author o*
the high-hat ordinance, sweet singer and
Bohemian, returned from abroad Tues
day evening 1 and made his appearance on
"the line" yesterday afternoon attired in
clothes that put the sun In the shade and
heated up his vicinity. The doctor ex
tended his hand so gladly and so ofteu
that before the sun could escape to the
other side of the thoroughfare his arm
was limp and sore.
As the popular medico walked down thÂ©
street he kept cool shuddering at the lat
est things in millinery which the young
ladies of this city were wearing. Tho
dainty "creations." hidden behind bird3.
Rowers, fruit and feathers, reminded him
of his ' experience In Milan, Italy. He
went to the opera one evening and was

MRS. HENARIE'S SUIT
CALLED FOR TRIAL
During the renaissance in Italy very
ornately ' carved and gilded chairs were
guardians of the stately doorways into
the spacious saloons of Florentine noble
men, but they were not nearly a3 invit
ing as the comfortable looking chair
found in the house ofvMlchael Angelo.
The apparent hardness of these carved
wood or ebony chairs was greatly modi
fied before the. introduction of upholstery
by portable cushions. During the reign
of Queen tilizabeth these * "qnyashens"
were fashioned of richest materials, tap
estries and velvet, embroidered in gold
taste for Gothic architecture set in the
style in woodwork naturally followed the
prevailing standards in stonework. The
Gothic style with Us rich carving and
paneling was particularly . adapted . for
.chairs of state, but was wholly unsuited
for domestic use. A fine example of this
species of woodwork is the historic oak
coronation chair in Westminster Abbey.
Through the quatrefoil opening.? under the
sear* may be seen the famous coronation
stone, which, according to. ancient tradi
tion, is the verv one upon which Jacob
pillowed his head at Bethel. The original
chair made for King Edward I (129G-1300)
was not supported by the. four carved
lions, which are of modern workmanship
and were regilded for Queen Victoria's
jubilee. Tha remarkable preservation of
this gabled oak chair is undoubtedly due
to the fact that until quite recently It has
been coated over with gilded plaster.
SEDAN CHAIR OF CHARLES V.
The change of temperature yesterday
morning was very pudden. It climbed
from 70 to Â¥3 degrees between tho hours of
9 and 12. The thermometer went up eleven
degrees in two hours. It went back almost
as quickly, however.' as at 4 o'clock the
conditions were quite comfortable, the
mercury having dropped down to 76.
High collars wilted like a rose out of
water and stiff laundered shirts gave way
to the loose negligee apparel. Handker
chiefs were turned into mops, and it was
no uncommon sight to see men lined up
under an awning wiping beads of perspira
tion from their faces. The Icecream par
lors thrived as did the drinking-houses.
The suburban electric lines did an un
usually big business, many women and
children finding the ride a pleasant reiief
from close rooms. The school children
suffered from the heat and in some of the
rooms the teachers shortened the hours
of study. The salt-water plunge baths
were heavily patronized.
"It was pretty hot to-day," said
Weather Prophet McAdie, "but it is likely
to be warmer to-morrow. The indications
arÂ« for continued warm weather forHwo
days. To-day was the hottest since last
October, when there was one day on
which the. thermometer went up to 94.
The hottest day on record in San Fran
cisco was June 29, 1891, when the mercury
touched the 100 mark. The hottest day
this summer, prior to to-day, was June
5, when the mercury was at 74. "â¢
Mr. McAdie attributes the sudden
change in the weather to the dispelling
of a continuous fog bank, 1200 miles long,
which hovered along the California coast
up to Tu<'Fday night. Its sudden disap
pearance has given the sun a fair chance
to shine unobstructed over San Francisco.
Then, too, there is a high pressure over
Oregon and Southern Washington, which
is rushing southeast. It Is now over
Northern California and Nevada and is
following on the heels of a period of cool,
clear weather. The interior will prpbably
catch it in earnest to-morrow.
The thermometer on top of the Weather
Bureau rooms reached its lowest point
yesterday at noon, when it registered 83
degrees In the shade. But that was more
than 200 feet up. ' The thermometers on
the streets below were fairly slzziing un
der the. boiiine rays of old Sol. At the
corner of Market, and Third streets, on
the sunny side, it was 90 degrees at noon.
Some of the sidewalks were like brick
ovens. Pedestrians invariably picked the
shady side and those whose business did
not call them out were glad to remain
indoors and tii> iced lemonade.
Hot, did you say? Well, slightly. Yes
terday was the warmest this year, but :t
was only a forerunner of what San Fran
ciscans have coming to them, if the pre
dictions of Weather Prophet AIcAuie
count for anything.

T. B. Walker, wbo Is largely interested
In the lumber business in Minneapolis, is
reported to be at Sisson, in the northern
part of the State, figuring out a scheme
which means a huge raid upon the grow
ing timber of California.
Walker has bought several townships in
Siskiyou County, and his purchases are
reported to also include lands in jModoc
County. He nas ampie capital. His pur
pose is to construct a logging road in the
next two years, and then me wnolesale
cutting of timber will proceed wnen ho
linds it expedient. -
Within the past few months representa
tives of the Wierhouser syndicate have
been looking over the timber lands of
California, Oregon and Washington. This
concern has recently acquired extensive
tracts in the Pacific Coast States. For the
past live years this syndicate has sawn
an annual average of five hundred million
feet of lumber. __
In addition to these concerns the firm
of Smith it Rogers of Minneapolis is rep
resented now by a member of the concern
or a trusted employe, who has viewed, tne
timber lands of the Pacilic Coast with
acquisitive eyes. The last-named him has
acquired two tracts, one redwood and the
other sugar pine. Both -are large pur
chases.
A gentleman who has personally met
represntatives of the three large concerns
named while they have been exploring
on the coast says that they all told him
that the general expectation was held in
the East that the lumber business of the
United States will be shifted to the Pacific
Coast in the next ten years. The enor
mous destruction of timber in th* region
of the Great Lakes will force the lumber
interests to migrate. The plans are made
for great operations on this coast.
Prominent members of the California
Water and Forest Association were much
disturbed at the narration of these facts
yesterday. The deforesting of great Cali
fornia areas would seriously affect the
water supply of the State. The preserva
tion of forests is a part of the associa
tion's work. Nothinc can be done to stop
deforesting except through public pres
sure brought' to bear In the proper quar
ter. Some hope is entertained that the
Water and Forest Asssociatlon member
ship will soon grow very numerous. There
has been a recent boom in that direction.
Repudiated the Notes.
SidnV M. Smith has sued the Pacific
Vinegar and Pickle Works to recover
$7200. the face value of five promissory
notes issued by the California Packing
Company and payable to the order of the
Pacilic Vinegar and Pickle Works. Sub
ject to the delivery of the notes to the
Pacific Vinegar and Pickle Works the
same were assigned to the plaintiff, Sid
ney M. Smith, who alleges he paid for
them their full face value. At the ma
turity of the notes they were presented
to the California Packing Company for
payment, but such was refused by this
corporation. Smith now seeks judgment
against the assignor of the notes as
stated.
Although after the Norman conquest
the unsettled state of the country forbade
much development along the line of in
dustrial arts, there was some improve
ment in the manner of living. King Hen
Â¦ ry II encouraged domestic improvements
in the homes* of his barons and courtiers,
Â¦ and the old cpmfortless mode of living
gradually disappeared among the upper
classes. The principal furniture, strongly
bound iron chests, which could be speed
ily hidden. in case of attack, were then
replaced by armories and bedsteads.
Stairs were made in houses, and the do

(Said to have been used by some of
Cromwell's family.)
Although detesting everything Napo
leonic in England, the classic revival
spread acro33 the channel, and the dis
tinguished cabinetmakers. Chippendale.
Sheraton and Heppjewhite. showed un
doubted traces of French Influence. Al
most all the furniture designed by Chip
pendal# was made by his sons, and could
we regard aÂ» genuine all the so-called
Chippendale chairs of the curio hunter
and antiquity shops we must perforce re
gard the great designer as a patriarch
whose sons were legion. His elegant ma
hogany chairs are distinguished by "the
well-molded sweep of his lines." thÂ© sub
stitution of ornate ribbon designs of wood
instead of upholstery In the backs of
chairs, and by the excellent woodwork,
conspicuous for Its careful choice of beau
tiful velnlngs. The republicatlon of hta
book of designs has recently brought
about a fad for collecting specimens of his
furniture. His foreman. Sheraton, had
recourse to Inlaying, which is a distin
guishing mark of his work. His designs
also showed more of the simple severity
of the academic style, and the illustra
tions of his later drawing-room chairs, or
namented with heads and claws of ani
mals, are plainly dominated by the "em
pire" influence. Unfortunately this Eng
lish furniture was not redeemed by the
excellent metal work mountings which in
France went so far to counteract tha
heaviness of Napoleonic furniture. Hep
plewhite. like Sheraton and Chippendale,
published a cabinetmakers' guide, and like
Sheraton made some of his designs nota
bly the chair with Prince of Wales crest,
conformable to popular enthusiasm. His
eared armchair Is nowadays consid
ered a prize by the happy pos
sessor of an antique bedroom, anx
ious for a commodious chintz-covered
chair In harmony with the generaf quaint
ness of- the room. Another furniture
maker of the early part of this century
was George Smith, "upholsterer extra
ordinary to H. R, H. the Prince of
terioration in taste. The discovery of thÂ«
buried cities of Herculaneum and Pom
peii (1713), and the books printed some
fifty years later led to the demand for
classic design. This return to classicism
was quickened by the imperialism of Na
poleon, and consequently the empire stylo
reflected in a measure the acquisitions of
the conqueror.
The headquarters and band and Troops
A and B of the Ninth Cavalry, arrived at
the Presidio late Tuesday night. lieu
tenant Armstrong commands Company A,
and B is commanded >â Captain Findley.
Colonel Thomas McGregor commands the
squadron of the Ninth Cavalry now at the
Presidio, which consists of Troops A. B,
C, D, F and H. Troops E and G are now
en route from Fort Apache, Arizona. The
entire command is scheduled to leave here
on August 15.
Colonel McGregor of the Ninth is well
known in San Francisco. Some years ago
he was stationed at the Presidio. He has
a brilliant record as an Indian fighter and
also served with distinction In the Civil
and Spanish-American wars.
P. w. Beckman and W. Earle Chapman,
acting assistant surgeons. U. S. A^. have
been assigned to temporary duty 'at the

was held yesterday at the Presidio. C. E.
Perdue, private of Troop F, Fourth Cav
alry, died yesterday at the general hos

Captain McBlain of the Ninth Cavalry
is an old San Franciscan. He played ball
with the Athletics in 1878. He still has
great fondness for the game and says he
has in his troop a team that can give a
fine exhibition. They wear neat ; gray
uniforms and call themselves the San
Juans.
The camp at the Presidio Is now, with
the exception of the Ninth Cavalry, de
serted; but so rapid Is the westward
movement of troops that- but a day or so
will elapse before it is again occupied
The soldiers that have been gathering
there since the departure of the Hancock
left yesterday on the Meade.
The headquarters, band and two bat
talions of the First United States In
fantry, recently ordered to Fort Leaven
wt>rth. have received further orders as
signing them to duty in the Philippines.
It is more than probable that upon their
arrival here orders will be awaiting them
which will mean the carrying out of Gen
eral Shatter's' policy of making the Pre
sidio an infantry post. In such a case
the headquarters of the First will remain
here and some other regiment will proceed
to Manila. In all probability the head
quarters of the Third Artillery now at the
Presidio will be transferred to Honolulu
instead of to Fort Monroe, Virginia.
This movement of headquarters has been
expected for some time, and it is supposed
that the change was delayed until such
time as Shatter's old regiment, the First
Infantry, should be ordered home from

KEW YORK. August 1.â Except for the deal
ings In a handful of stocks the list of Stock
Exchange business was a stagnant, inert mass
to-day. Many usually active stocks dropped
out of the dealings entirely and transactions
in other prominent stocks fell to insignificant
proportions. Sugar. Union Pacific, ! Baltimore
and Ohio and Brooklyn Transit made the mar
| ket and all the rest of the dealings might
j have been dropped out of public notice for j
| any significance they had on current condl
j tlons. There is not much expectation that
| conditions will change in the stock market
for some time to come. The world of capital
' awaits the solution of the problem in China

. Owing to friction over bucket shops the Chi
cago Board of Trade has ceased to send out
quotations, but the brokers received the fluc
tuations through' their Chicago connections. The
market hovered about 75c, opening with an up
ward tendency, but subsequently weakening in
sympathy with Corn. Spot deliveries were
about 1,500,000 bushels and August deliveries
were steady. About 100,000 bushels were taken
for export. There was a good shipping and
speculative demand and the only selling waa by
shorts on crop prospects.
Local futures were firmer, but spot prices
stood the same.

XEW YORK, Aug. 1.â There were a good
many disappointed brokers around the wheat
pit to-day. All visions of a heavy speculative
trade at the expense of Chicago, wllose quota
tions were cut oft from the tickers to-day and
replaced by New York prices, vanished. In
stead of clamorous activity there was holiday
dullness most of the session, so profound at
times that messenger boys nodded and pit
traders sat around the ring edge in fantastic
attitudes waiting for the country to appreciate
Chicago's bad form and excluslveness and send
their orders to New- York. But somehow the
public was slow to change Its custom and or
ders ' did Â¦ not come in as expected, .Optimistic
brokers said the. test was not a fair one; more
time should be allowed, that news anyway did
not warrant much activity. Others eat around
and gloomily, watched .the Chicago board, where
prices were' occasionally chalked down as they
dribbled in 'over, private wires, wishing again
for the' merry^ ticks which formerly kept the
two markets In- constant touch. During '/the
first hour just . twenty wheat and eleven corn
quotations were " received from Chicago, wh. lie
a couple of million â¢ bushels would cover the
morning transactions â¢ at New York. Later In
the day, . however, business picked up a little
and with it came advancing prices, based on
a better demand for cash property at the West,
both for domestic and export purposes. Final
prices, which were top for the day, showed %
C?ic advances- over Tuesday night. Future
sales about â¢8,500.000 bushels. .

The condition of the Apricot, Prune and
other /mit crops will bÂ« found In the Govern
ment report in the first column. â¢ It rer>orts a
lessened Prune yield, owing to the sever* JunÂ«
and July "drop."
Thus far the Cured Fruit Association has
apparently made a hit by holding back the
opening prices, for the expected scarcity In the
large sizes has caused an advance in the New
York market. It seems that the longer the
opening prices are kept back the firmer the
market gets. The curse of the Prune market
for the past four or five years has been the
pernicious practice of selling new fruit along
In July, which Invariably smashed the market
for the balance of the season and lost millions
of dollars to the Prune growers of the State.
The association has the market In Its own
hands this year and Its success or failure will
largely depend on the prices lt sets. Growers
are watching with great interest.

ANOTHER TUGBOAT TO
ROUND CAPE HORN
Special Dispatch to The Call
NEW YORK, Aug. l.-Tugboat trips
from New York to San Francisco are still
unusual enough to deserve comment, al
though one vessel of this type recently
completed the journey without incident
and another is now on the way. The last
to essay the voyage is the tug L. Lucken
bach, a craft which was recently sold by
her New York owner to John D. Spreckels
& Co. of San Francisco.
The Luckenbach is to sail as soon as she
can be equipped for her long voyage.
Captain McCoy, who will command her
on the trip to the Golden Gate, has no
doubt that he will take her safely through
the Straits of Magellan and to her des
tination. The Luckenbach Is .of the type
called "ocean-going," and it Is the boast
of those who sail this type of tug that
they can outride a storm which would
swamp much larger steamers.
The Luckenbach is one of the biggest of
her class, measuring 135 feet In length.
Her gross tonnage is 260. Steaming at a
twelve-knot gait, the vessel can carry coal
sufficient for three weeks.
CRAZY CHINESE YELLS
AT CROWD FROM CUPOLA
Ah Jim, a Chinese domestic, was taken
to the Receiving Hospital last night and
placed In the detention cell to await trial
before the Insanity Commissioners.
Jim in some manner got on the roof
of the Pioneer building on Fourth street
and cried lustily for help. Officer Mc-
Cormlck went to his assistance, but when
he reached the roof the Chinaman had
climbed to the high cupola of tho building
and attracted a large crowd on the street
below by his loud yells.
When the officer started to go through
the cupola Jim slid down the flag rope and
jumped to the roof of the next building,
about thirty-five feet below. McCormlck
followed, and when he reached the crazy
man he was surprised to see he was un
injured beyond a sprain of one wrist.
The officer was compelled to use his clUb
In order to subdue him. Jim was finally
taken to the street and sent in the am
bulance to the hospital.
FATHERLESS AND MOTHERLESS
AND LOOKING FOR A HOME
THREE childrenâ two sisters and a
brotherâ were battledored from Vic
toria, British Columbia, to this city
and are being shuttlecocked back
again. That is the game that has been
played with them for the past. nine years.
The death of their Indian mother and the
desertion by their unnatural father, an
English lawyer, threw them upon the
charity of the cold world. They were sent
to this city to be taken care of, but the
immigration officials, fearing that they
may become public charges,' refused to al
low them to land. - :Â¦ .
Their case is very peculiar. If not mys
terious. Their names are Llllie Gertrude
Low, aged 14 years; May Low, 12 years;
and Arthur Low. 10 years. They arrived
on the steamer --Walla'' Walla yesterday
morning, and Mrs. McMahon of 425 Hayes
street was at the dock to receive > them.
She told Captain Schell of the Immigra
tion Bureau that the children had been
Llllie, or Gertrude as she Is commonly
called; said that her : mother was a \ dark
woman. and her father a British, lawyer.
She is a bright girl of modest- demeanor.
Captain Schell was of the opinion that
Mrs. McMahon was not a responsible per-
Bon ; and he refused 'â¢ to allow the children
to come ashore,; f ' : .,-.. . ,/ *

by a Catholic priest named Father Nick
olal, who had agreed to pay her $365 per
annum for the support of the three chil
dren. In answer to Captain Schell as to
whether she was a Catholic Mrs. C. Mc-
Mahon replied that she .was a Jesuit, but
she was unable 'Â¦ to give the name of the
priest In her parish and' excused herself
by saying that she seldom attended
church and that the parish priest was
changed so often "that it was Impossible
to keep track of him. She admitted frank

her' the money she would, be unable to

SANTA ROSA, Aug. 1.â While a great
many rumors are in circulation here con
cerning the whereabouts and probable
capture of the fugitive murderer, J. E.
King, he Is still at liberty.
Sheriffs Grace and Taylor are In Men
doclno County and word reached this city
this afternoon that they had captured
their man near Manchester, but the re
port proved to be untrue. The officers are
pursuing a hot trail. Sheriff Taylor
passed through town last night headed
north, and later in the evening it was
ascertained that he hai> telegraphed
ahead for fresh teams to be in readiness
at different points beyond Ukiah. It is
therefore probable that the news of the
capure of King may come at any mo
ment. King, without doubt, headed di
rectly north after the shooting, evidently
hoping to make the coast and escape by
some of the numerous small schooners
landing at the different points.
LAYTONVILLE. Aug. 1.â Man-hunting

fugitive murderer King, who is said to be
in this vicinity. Two well-known trailers,

tack.
Sheriff Bogard and Coroner Bailey
started for the scene of the killing on
hearing of the affray, and District Attor
ney Gill and Court Reporter Brownlee
started later.
From meager reports it is learned that
Bassett, who married Cooper's daugter on
May 22, 1900, was working in Paskenta at
his" trade as a painter, and each night
went to the Cooper ranch, three miles
from town. He would go home drunk and
run the women out of the house with a
knife. He did this Tuesday, and Mr.
Cooper was sent for. When he arrived
Bassett started at him with the knife and
Cooper shot him.

FARMER SHOOTS
HIS SON-IN-LAW
When the reason had been explained to
Manager Frawley he at once gave the de
sired permission, and Ashton was out of
the theater like a streak. The wedding
took place at the- chapel of the Good Sa
maritan at the appointed hour. Miss Lil-
THERE Is an actor In town who does
not believe it is necessary to spend
much time on wedding preparations.
That man is Herbert Ashton of the
Frawley Company. Yesterday morning at
rehearsal Actor Ashton stepped up to
Manager Frawley and requested that he
might be excused for an hour. Frawley
at first denied the privilege. Ashton be
came persistent in his wish for an hour's
leave, and stated that his business was
most important. He then explained that
he was going to marry a member of the
company at 3 o'clock, and that he would
like Just an hour in which to make the
arrangements. . 'Â¦ 'Â¦ â¢
Han Branscombe was the fair bride. She
looked pretty in her nuptial gown. The
bridesmaid was Miss Barney, also a mem
ber of the company. The ceremony was
performed by the Rev. Mr. Turner, vicar
of the chapel.
Cupid has certainly been kind to the
young and happy couple, as they have
been in the same dramatic companies to
gether both in Australia and here for the
â¢ past three years. They left Australia
with the Maggie Moore Company about
nine months ago and have only recently
joined the Frawley organization.
The honeymoon will necessarily be spent
in the city, as Ashton Is in the cast of
the "Red Lamp," playing the part of Gen
eral Morakoff. Last night he was at the
theater at the "first call," and stated that
he was happy; that he did not believe In
elaborate wedding arrangements, and
that a man could have Just as, pleasant a
time working during his honeymoon as if
he was down at Del Monte gathering sea
shells by the beach.
ILev. Father O'Ryan Lectures on Good
Work of Missionaries Before
Truth Society.
The regular monthly religious exercises
under the auspices of the Catholic Truth
Society were held last night at St. Mary's
Cathedral. A sermon was delivered by
Rev. Father Philip O'Ryan on "The Per
secution of the Catholic Missionaries in
China."
"In the spead of Catholic truth
throughout the land," said Father O'Ryan.
"one cannot but stand appalled at the
terrible events now taking place in the
Far East. We read of murders of the
foulest description taking place in and
around Peking, and it brings to mind the
terrible persecutions to which the Catho
lic mipsiunaries have been subjected for
Â»vor 800 yÂ«ars. The church has struggled
against these persecutions and she is
>ir.'r.gt-r tn-day than ever she was. It Is
not generally km.wn that Catholicism has
flourished in China, but even in the thir
teenth century Peking had a Catholic
Archbishop. Through tbe untiring efforts
<>f the Jesuit Fathers 300 Catholic churches
w*re eftablif^h^d In tlie various, provinces
ur.il the Catholic population is over 1.000 -
000. Through the fteii of the Jesuit, Fran
ciscan and Dominican fathers the pros-
IK-ctS: for christianizing China . were
bright, but i he rape of the heathen has
again broken out.: Not for long, however,
for the Catholic church will rise triumph

PERSECUTION OF THE
CATHOLICS IN CHINA
The Lafayette Primary School, near the
fummit of Telegraph Hill, was again vis
ited by fire yesterday and from the same
cause as on the former occasions-careless
painters burning off old paint with gaso
line torches. The fire was on the roof
and did about Â£>00 worth of damage. For
tunately the children had been dismissed
at 10 o'clock in the morning and when the
lire broke out In the afternoon the build
ing was unoccupied, so that there was not
the â¢same cause for alarm that there was
when the building took fire two months
ago. .Â¦â¢,_â¢.-â¢..;Â¦ Â¦ - . â¢ . '
Yesterday the painters were merrily at
work again and succeeded in burning
themselves out of a job. But they fur
nished work for the carpenters and* buslr
ness for the lumbermen.
Some one dropped a lighted cigar into
the driveway of the Coos Bay Coal Com
pany's bunkers on Davis street, between
Broadway and ValleJ.o. yesterdav after
noon and a lire was the result. The coal
dust Inflamed by the heat started to
ernoke out the cipar butt and succeeded.
The Fire Department was called out. for
the works were covered with a dense
cloud of Mack smoke, and for a time it
was thought that the coal in the bunkers
was beinj; consumed. Several thousand
people gathend. but in a short time the'
firemen exTing-uishxMl the flames. The
damage will not exceed $1.7).

Deciding course â Sacramento Boy beat Victor
Queen, 24-5.
A short ender in the deciding course,
Walsh & Heenan's Sacramento Boy,
surprised the favorite, J. R. Smith's Vic
tor Queen, and captured the midweek
stake at San Mateo Park yesterday, with
many points to spare.
Victor Queen was a 5-2 favorite, with
little Sacramento Boy money In sight.
The' final course was a long, hard one, all
over the park, but the score of 24-5 shows
that it belonged to Sacramento Boy from
the slip to the kill.
The excessive heat tcld upon the dogs
and several were withdrawn for this rea
son. In the first round Eleven Spot had
a very trying course with Lady Bess, win
ning the racing but paying a life penalty.
The dog died in the kennels soon after.
The hares were exceptionally strong and
this added to the strain on the hounds.
Several "sure things" went a-Erllmmer
ing. Martha "Washington defeated Moss
Rose, a 6-1 favorite; King's Borderer fell
to Imperial, a 5-2 favorite, and Best Bar
gain, on the short end of a 1-2 shot, took
the money from Benicia Boy, but after
ward, favorite over Victor Queen, was
defeated by the runner-up. There were
several other short enders to come within
the money. The stake was run as fol
lows:

after playing the machine he won 25

They were released on $50 cash bail each.
Chief Sullivan in speaking of the ar
rests yesterday said: "Every man hav
ing a machine who pays in coin will be
arrested. Those who pay in liquor or ci
frars are protected by the law. About
three weeks ago an attorney representing
a syndicate who owns the machines called
upon me and asked that all the machines
which were seized last year and that are
now In our storeroom be returned and
he would promise that they should only
be used for paying in merchandise. An
agreement to that effect had been made
and any one breaking the agreement
would hav'e the machine taken from him.
I declined to deliver up the machines
and referred him to the District Attorney.
Now I understand that a large number
have not been keeping the alleged agree
ment and I propose to arrest them.
There are 753 slot, machines licensed, for
which $7530 Income is received per quarter
by the city, and if they did not pay a good

where an inquest will be held.
Emll Gunzburger. real estate dealer,
residing at 31 Eddy street, knew Mrs La
Roche. He said last night: "I managed
her business. We had known her for ten
or twelve years. This Is a double shock
to us. So far as we knew, the dead wo
man lived a very quiet life. I have never
seen her Intoxicated." At this point R.
M. Gunzburger, a brother of the speaker,
silenced him and stated that enough had
been said on the subject. The police' are
searching for Mrs. Rose.
Mrs. Jean La Roche, a divorced woman,
died last night at the Hotel Sutherland,
on Jones and Sutter streets,. from the ef
fects of a criminal operation performed
by a Mrs. Emma Rose a few days ago.
On Tuesday morning Mrs. La Roche
went to the residence of Miss Simpson, a
professional nurse, at 514 Taylor street,
very much under the influence of liquor.
The intoxicated woman cried for whisky,
a flask of which was given her. She then,
after urging Miss Simpson to accompany
her home, went to the Sutherland. Here
she became violently ill and sent for Dr.
V. E. Putnam, a surgeon at the Receiving
Hospital. Before the doctor arrived Mrs
La Roche confided to Miss Simpson that
she had had a criminal operation per
formed by the Rose woman at 42 Second
street. When Dr. Putnam arrived he
treated the sick woman for alcoholism.
Later, when he learned- of the operation,
he treated his, patient for peritonitis.

ANTI-PHELAN, RALLY:
IN THE TWENTY-EIGHTH
After considerable r debate a motion to
adjourn until Tuesday evening next was
put and carried by a vote of 42 to 39.
- â¢'
Commltteeman Truman spoke in favor
of the resolution, saying that he was op
posed to the old primary methods, where
corruption and - dishonesty reigned su
preme, and favored having the selection
of officers rest upon as small a body as
possible. He was followed by J.G. Boyne
and Adrian Smith, 'Who spoke in a similar
strain. Max Goldberg and others, spoke
against the resolution.
Resolved. That the chair appoint a commit
tee of eoven, of which he shall be one. to take
legal advice concerning existing laws regardlns
primary elections.' with full power to act In all
matters with reference to the election or selec
tion of delegates to all conventions and subdi
visions thereof Â¦which may be held unnler the
auspices of the Republican County Committee.
The committee met in Shiels' building,
32 O'Farrell street, and indulged in a
spirited parliamentary discussion without
transacting much business. The meeting
was called -for the purpose of discussing
the recent decision of the Supreme Courc
regarding the Stratum primary law, and
more particularly to give the committee
a chance to define Its position or rather
locate its standing under the ruling.
Immediately after Chairman Bouvier
called the meeting to order Commltteeman
McCarthy of the Thirty-ninth District in
troduced a resolution, as follows: .-;'-..":
The committee will meet again next
Tuesday. The question will then be deter
mined whether the regular Republican
organization of San Francisco shall be
controlled by Kelly* Crimmins and Lynch,
who represent the railroad company, or
by the respectable elements of citizenship.
The Wolfes, the Dibbles, the Lynches and
all the touts and parasites of the Mint
saloon will be arrayed against the forces
of good government and clean politics.
The outcome of the contest will be ob
served by thirty thousand Republican
voters of San Francisco.
Other commltteemen listened to the
bosses. Kelly and Crimmins were on the
outside, sending for the weak and pliable.
John C. Lynch, Collector of Internal Rev
enue, was there as the agent of Herrin to
do politics for the railroad. He draws a
salary from the Government, but gives
his time to the railroad gang and uses his
Federal position to degrade the Republican
party. The corrupt elements working on
the weak and faltering succeeded In em
barrassing the committee and postponing
action.
Max Goldberg, who is making Eddie
Wolfe's fight for State Senator, joined
with Crimmins, Kelly and Lynch to defeat
the resolution.
The Republican County Committee met
last night and failed to adopt a resolu
tion providing for immediate steps to pre
pare for the election of delegates to the
nominating conventions. Several coramit
teemen wno were recognized as advocates
of . clean politics wore misled by repre

be postponed until next Tuesday. â

There was another rally in Saratoga Hull
last evening of voters who call themselves
the genuine Bryan and Stevenson Club of
the Thirty-ninth district. There were
about 200 present. Dr. George' S.~ Potta
was chairman and John Quinlan secre
tary. Resolutions indorsing the national
ticket were passed and speeches were
made : by F. S. Woods, national comtnlt
teeman from Washington. Max Popper,
Edward McCabe and R. V. Whiting. The
following-named campaign committee was
appointed:- William . Wedemeyer. Lewis
Lubosch. i William T. Kearns. William H.
McCarthy, John Hellemer, Myjea Dolan,
P. J. Cooney, Joseph J. Cody, W. W. Me-
Rally in Saratoga Hall.
Senator R. Porter Ashe gave a brief
anti-Phelan talk and he was followed by
Charles Edelman, who made a scathing
attack upon the administration. He said
in part:
"I understand that certain members of
the official class In the City Hall have
made an insinuation to members of the
State Central Committee, and the state
ments have gone into the interior "that It
is utterly impossibletoholda fair primary
in the city and county of San Francisco;
that all tho^e who opposed the appointing
of delegates to a convention or who favor
ed-an open primary were men who were
on the outside and who were repeaters,
thugs, disturbers and the lawless element
of the Democratic party, and that was the
reason why the Committee of One Hun
dred had found it necessary to appoint
delegates to a State and county conven
tion. Also that it has been ascertained
that the members of the State Central
Committee from the Interior are In favor
of holding primaries and that Charles
Edelman. who received a*' proxy from
Hon. J. Harvey McCarthy of San Diego,
was urged by McCarthy to oppose with
all his might the appointing of delegates
to the State convention, because if dele
gates were appointed to the State conven
tion San Diego County would be lost to
W. J. Bryan.
"The Democrats of San Francisco are
getting heartily tired of a Democracy
under the leadership of a stovepipe dicta
tor, whose Democracy consists largely of
driving to the ferry when delegates walk
ed, and of driving to the national conven
tion when other delegates walked, and
who insinuated, and made the statement
on the train going to Kansas City, that
the only Democrats who .were opposed to
his administration were a few whipper
snappers who could not obtain jobs under
him.
; "Now if this State Is lost to Bryan it
will be owing to the fact that a man. or
set of men who have no sympathy what
ever with Bryan or with the platform of
1S% and 1900 have used their Influence for
patronage for the purpose of investing
a- would-be -czar with a senatorial toga
to the exclusion of a national fight in fa
vor of William J. Bryan, in which and for
which they have not. the slightest sym
pathy." Â¦ .
The speaker resented the Imputation
upon the fame of this city and claimed
that from 1849 to 1S97 the city thrived and
prospered; that the laws were obeved nnd
that law and order prevailed: but the
members of the' Interior have been given
to understand that now there exists a con
dition in San Francisco that makes -it
Impossible to hold a fair primary. -.
Many of the most prominent Democrats
in the district were present. A resolution
was passed emphatically protesting
against the rumored appointment of anv
delegates to the State convention, as well
as against the appointment of election
officers by the County Committee, and a
committee of three was appointed to con
fer, with the State Central Committee with
a view of promulgating a plan for the
reorganization of the Democratic party
of the city and county until a primary
law shall have been enacted by the Leg
islature that will stand the test of judicial
interpretation. The committee chosen
consists of "William A. Peake, Stephen A.
Sullivan, Frank .Sweeney and the chair
man and secretary. The following vice
presidents were named from each of the
sixteen precincts in the district: John
Brownjold, Patrick McVeigh. David
Bridge wood/ Joseph Sullivan, John Raf
ferty, John Connors. Patrick Moynahan,
John Connelly, John O'Neill, James Sut
ton. John Barr. John Coakley, Lawrence
J. Conlon, P. H. Shanley, W. M. HInton
and James E. Moore.
The Twenty-eighth District is not the
only one where an anti-Phelan feeling
has appeared. At a rally held by the
Bryan and Stevenson Club In the Thirty
ninth District Tuesday night some pretty
strong things, that were far from compli
mentary to the administration, were said.
Last night's meeting Â¦was called to order
by Henry Healy, who Â¦was made perma
nent chairman, with Thomas Conlon per
manent secretary. The meeting was the
outcome of a gathering neM two weeks
ago In the same district when the Phelan
men undertook to run things to suit them
selves. Permanent organization was per
fected last night and the mission of the
club will be to elect \V. J. Bryan and turn
down Mayor Phelan.
gates to the National Democratic Con
vention, poured a veritable rain of hot
shot upon the administration and the ap
plause which followed his sharp denuncia
tions of the Mayor was evidence enough
that the crowd was with him.

"To with you." retorted Blank. "Iâ"
Thompson without waiting for Blank
to finish the sentence struck him in the
face. As the sergeant staggered back
Thompson drew his revolver, intending to
shoot Blank, but was prevented by Price
and Shaw. Last night Thompson was sus
pended by Chief Sullivan. He will have
a hearing before the Police Commission
ers on next Tuesday night.
Thompson is considered one of the best
nien in the department. He has been con
nected with it for about fifteen years and
is credited with a number of brilliant cap
tures. About ten years ago Thompson
arrested a man for disturbing the peace
and while on the way to the police sta
tion the prisoner drew a knife and tried
to kill him. In defense of his life Thomp
son shot his assailant and the latter died.
The policeman was exonerated by the
Coroner'6 jury and .was subsequently ac
quitted of the charge after 'an examina
tion in the Police Court.
Sergeant Blank was appointed a mem
ber of the force through Dan Burns. After
being made a sergeant he was assigned
to duty at the Central station, but on ac
count of his brutal treatment of his men
he was transferred to the Seventeenth
street station. He Is regarded as a "bully"
by his subordinates, many of whom refuse
to sp^ak to him unless it Is absolutely
necessary.
Thompson accused Blank of trying to
make trouble for him and announced his
intention of entering a complaint with tha
Chief of Police.
and Thompson, accompanied by Price and
Shaw, returned to the Seventeenth-street
station. Acting Sergeant Hagarty, after
a whispered conversation with Blank, told
Thompson to go home.
"What have I done?" inquired Thomp
son. "I think I am able to patrol my
beat."
Sergeant Blank replied that Thompson
was drunk and in a slurring manner told
him to "get next to himself."
Yesterday Joseph. Coburn received a let
ter . from his: sister and brother-in-law,
Mr. and Mrs. Quick of Brooklyn. N. Y.,
in which they state that "the last time
Almira (Mrs. Townsend) was here she
told us she, had made a will." Coburn is
not certain just when Mrs. Townsend vis
ited the Quicks the last time, but he be
lieves it was within the last few years.
The matter of granting the letters of
administration will come up on the 17th
Inst.
The next great issue to be met in the
case will be the matter of granting letters
of administration. According to Van R.
Paterson. Mrs. Murray, to be entitled to
the right to administer, must not only
establish a residence here, but also must
prove that she Is "a fit and proper J?er
son." Attorney Hassett. acting for Pub
lic Administrator Boland, has been mak
ing diligent inquiries into the matter of
Mrs. Murray's residence. He says if Mrs.
Murray had decided to take up her resi
dence here she had not told any of her
Eastern friends so. and further that she
had not disposed of her home in the East,
which stands just as on the day she left
It.
Yesterday Judge Paterson was Inclined
to fear that at the inquest he had let
his sentiments get the better of his judg
ment. "There are more ways of killing
a person," said the Judge, "than by com
mitting a punishable crime. There are
ways of nagging a person to death, and
worrying a person to death, each as tru
ly effective as poisoning. Only in the
nagging and worrying cases the law has
no names for them. In the poisoning
case the law calls it murder. It has al
ways been my way to protect women,"
the Judge concluded, "but when a woman
acts the unnatural daughter, as Mrs.
Murray has, I believe her box Is no longer
a matter of consideration." \
The attorneys representing Joseph Co
burn, in whose possession the famous
Bradford letter Is, continue to refuse to
make public any part of it. Still they
say enough to indicate that the letter
is full of unpublished family history, all
having a direct bearing on the case.
"Almira had written that she feared
Ella would kill her"â that is the state
ment in the Bradford letter that was the
foundation for Van R. Paterson's sensa
tional outburst at the Townsend Inquest
on Tuesday.

FAMILY HISTORY
IN THE LETTER
FROM BRADFORD
THKRK Â¦were three interesting points
brought cut in the poolsellers' case
before Judge Cabaniss yesterday af
ternoon. One was an expert defini
tion of a clock pnme; another was an ex
pert definition of a tape game, and the
third was the statement from G. W.
Btuable that It was Phil Crimmins, the
political associate of William F. Herrin,
and no other to whom Valentine said he
paid Â£5 per cent of his winnings for pro
tection. ' Â¦
Kumble was the principal witness, and
the burden of his testimony was a de
scription of how the public is fleeced
when it runs against a bucket shop. Po
lice Ueutenant Martin had testified that
over the door of the poolsellers' place was
a sign twenty-Jive feet long or more, an
nouncing that within were direct wires to
Tuesday It was stated in the testimony
that "a man lamed Crlmmjns" had re
ceived the money; but yesterday the par
ticular Crimmins was designated and
named.
Rumble's definition of the tape game
and tho clock game were interesting. Of
the clock game he said:
Chicago and Xew York. Lieutenant Mar
tin was asked if he saw any . telegraph
instruments when he made the raid on
the place and he said he did not. Then
he was asked if he would have taken any
such instruments, had he seen them, as
evidence in tht? case, and he said he cer
tainly would have taken them along, and
afterward when Rumble was asked if
there were any such wires to the place
he said. "No, there never were."

"A clock game is carried on by means
of a mechanical device into which tick
ets are placed, and they are made to ap
pear by chance, and from their appearance
and the rise or fall of the numbers the
numbers are placed on the blackboard and
bets are made as to what the next num
ber will be.
"In the tape game the tape has num
bers placed upon it either by a rubber
stamp, pen and ink or a typewriter and
then It Is rolled up so it cannot be Been
except when it Is pulled out of the re
ceptacle Into which It has been rolled.
Then the numbers are called off and
placed on the blackboard and the bets are
made from the numbers on the black
board. Any one may put up his money
Â¦with the clerk and then he waits until
the numbers change In his favor or
against htm."
In ppening his testimony Rumble said
he was .interested In a mine in Orovllle
and the men from the mine used to %o
into Valentine's game and lose all their
money, so ; he decided to stop them by
breaking up the game. He says he tried
to break it up several times, but with in
different success. In addition he said he
had patented the boards Valentine was
using and he had been promised a per
centage for the use of them, but he had
not got his percentage. He said he had
at one time run a phonograph game on
the same principle as the clock and the
tape games, but this had been stopped by
the police and he paid a big fine in con
sequence: He says he told the Grand
Jury once and the court once of Valen
tine's game but it did no good.
Attorney Collins, for the defense, tried
to show by the witness that what had
happened in the place at 43 Ellis street
was not necessarily the selling of pools,
but he succeeded only In making matters
more indefinite than they were. Rumble
said he knew the calling off of the num
bers was an offer to sell because he was
familiar with the game and knew just
what it was. He said all the gamesâ the
phonograph, the clock and the tape â were
on the same principle, and one was no
better than the other.
In the examination In regard to Crlm
mins, Rumble said that Valentine had told
him It was Phil Crimmins who was re
ceiving the 25 per cent of the earnings
of the game. He was asked If the name
of Phil Crimmms had been mentioned in
connection with the case and he answered
