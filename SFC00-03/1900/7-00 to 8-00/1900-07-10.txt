Rauer said yesterday that he and Rog
ers looked up the question of heirs at the
bank, and Rogers found that the names
of the parents of the deceased Sullivan
were different from those of the relatives
of his heirs. Rauer was at the bank for a
purpose of his own. however. He had
been asked by Chretien to accommodate
one of his clients, who was going to Nome,
with some money. Chretien told him that
his client had an estate of $2500 coming to
him, and he wanted Rauer to take it up
and advance the money to his client.
Rauer wished to make sure 'of the fact
that the dead Sullivan and the depositor
of the Hlbernia Bank were the same per
son, so he went out to the bank to com
pare the signature of the depositor Sulli
van with that of Sullivan the deceased.
He says the examination satisfied him,
and so he advanced $1950 and took an order
for tho $2500 estate in return. He has not
been paid his tncney yet.
San Quentin Threatens.
Rauer says he never saw the heir, and
whatever he knows of him is from what
he has been told by Chretien. He says
that a week before the decree of distribu
tion Chretien c&me to him and showing
a power of attorney asked for the loan of
$500 for Sullivan the heir. Rauer let him
have Â«he money for a bonus of $100. and
the check was made payable to Sullivan.
Â¦ In speaking of the case yesterday Rauer
said:
"1 was. satisfied that the man Sullivan
was the proper heir, although I never saw
him and know him only through what
Chretien tcld me. I took up the estate
solely upon Â¦what representations were
made to me an-1 upon the orders of court.
I have not asked for my money yet, but
when I do. if I do not get it there will be
trouble. If that man Sullivan Is a bogus
heir I'll have liim sent to San Quentin,
and Chretien, too. It will be worth five
hundred more to yet even."
George T. Knox. the notary before
whom the deposition of Sullivan was
taken, declares he has had nothing to do
with the case. "When a man comes to
me to have his testimony taken he comes
upon an order of court, and all I do is to
swear him and see that his answers are
properly recorded," said Knox yesterday.
"I remember when Chretien and Ruef
came to me to have a deposition taken,
and as my office is small: they agreed that
I. should take it in Ruef's office. There
was only one witness, a man named Sul
livan. I had never seen him before, but
Chretien said he was the man mentioned
in the order of court, and so I swore him
and cook his testimony. I do not remem
ber what he paid, but I do remember that
witnin a few days, certainly within a
week, I had the deposition transcribed
and sent a copy of It out to the County
Clerk's office to be filed. I sent the copy
for filing out to the County Clerk by a
messenger boy. Mr. Ruef has a copy
of the deposition now. As for the witness
(Sullivan), I had never seen- him before
and I have not seen him since. Chretien
told roe he was the man whose deposition
I was to take under the order of 'court,
and I swore him and took his testimony."
Neryous Tension Prevails in Court.
The tension that tells the story of sup
pressed excitement seemed to prevail
among the many spectators who congre
gated in Judge Troutt's court early yester
day morning. They had gathered to listen
to new developments in the Sullivan es
tate scandal and to be ready on adjourn
ment to sit in the "post mortem" exam
ination they knew would follow the pre
sentation of the defense of the principals
In the conspiracy. At the hour of 10
o'clock Judge. Troutt entered .the court
room and was immediately approached by
Attorney Ruef, who informed the court
that he desired a hearing In regard to the
Sullivan estate expose. Judge .Troutt in
formed Mr. Ruef that h6 had ordered a
hearing for this morning, but finally yield
ed to Mr. Ruef's request that he be grant
ed an opportunity to make a statement.
Judge , Troutt took the bench, and Ruef.
while the lawyers ; in court gathered
around him. Including Reuben H. Lloyd,
who subsequently addressed the court as
"amicus curiae," rose to make ] â¢ his an
nouncements to the court. Judge Troutt,
however, opened proceedings. â¢ He^saJd:
lating to your Honor or myself. And I
v.lsh to say that the article Itself loes
not. say anything derogatory either to
your Honor or ourselves In express terms,
but simply by the headlines and the pub
lication of .our pictures; otherwise other
Â¦^proceedings would be taken against the
paper which has the hardihood to make
even these Implied assaults, :-
"Moreover, the deposition which is re
ferred to > as having been stolen from the
files is here and the clerk has it. Again,
it' is said that Mr. Chretien and others
have looted the estate and have stolen all
the money, implying that your Honor and
myself and others have had a share in
this looting. I desire to say now that the
money has not been paid over, but Is in
the hands of the adminsltrator, that at
the time that the decree of distribution
was made application was made to the
administrator to pay that money, but
upon rhy advice he refused to pay it until
the time for appeal from the decree had
elapsed. At that time. May 7, 1900. we
were notified that Mr. J. J. Rauer, who is
a shrewd business man, had purchased
the interest of the heir in the estate, and
after his Investigation, and having risked
his" money upon it, we were to some ex
tent, satisfied, in addition to the proof
here, that the right man was the John
Sullivan represented by Mr. Chretien, if
any doubt had before existed.
"Moreover, a bond was furnished to us
bv a" surety company guaranteeing us
against any possible harm or damage or
loss that might result from paying over
the money. But they were so insistent
upon saving every dollar in the estate
that when it finally came to paying the $60
that the surety company required they did
not pay it. The bond was in our posyes
slon for a long time. I think it was re
turned last week to the surety company
and is still in the possession of Mr. Rig
by, the attorney, the attorney in fact for
the surety company. The money is in our
possession yet. ~
Rauer Appears With Assignment.
"On last Saturday the sixty days from
the time of the flling of the decree had
elapsed and Mr. Rauer came with. his as
signment to the ottice of the adminis
trator and requested the payment of the
money to him, as he would have been en
titled to had the sixty days elapsed. We
demanded a certificate from the County
Clerk that the sixty days from the date
of the entry of the decree had elapsed.
The County Clerk furnished him such a
certificate. We telephoned out again 'for
further, assurance and found that injtead
of its being the 7th upon which the de
cree had been entered, it had - been illed

having a charge made against us that we
paid this money out knowingly for the
purpose of defrauding somebody whose
name does not appear in the papers nor
in the article. .

that if your Honor will instruct us to that
effect we will not pay over that money

Mr. Ruefâ I now ask that In view of the
serious charges that have been made

myself nor Drinkhouse nor your Honor,

that these people who have published the

assigned It to Jake Rauer, and Mr. Rauer
! agreed to leave It in. trust to the Public
Administrator for sixty days. For this
kindness even' body in the case seems, to
be deeply grateful to Mr. Rauer. After
signing his receipt In the office of Attor- j
ney Ruef .and assigning the entire estate j
of his brother to Jake Rauer, the bogus |
heir disappeared as mysteriously as he j
had come. No one is ready to produce |
him. as no one dares to produce hpn. ]
Jake Rauer demanded his money from
Attorney Ruef last Saturday and was re
fused payment on the ground that the j
sixty days had not expired. It is ad- ;
mltted that several hundred dollars were {
advanced by the Publip Administrator
! through his attorney. Ruef. before the
! estate became, through the process of the
I court, the property of the impostor.
This, however, will not alter the fact
that the Public Administrator is respons
ible to the court for the entire amount,
which is more than $3500. Judge Troutt
has, since the expose made by The Call
yesterday, decided to hold his decree of
distribution In abeyance. John M. Chre
tien will have an opportunity, therefore,
of proving in court the truth of his cli
ent's claim. It is possible that the heir
might be induced under these circum
stances to return to San Francisco. Jake
Rauer, who claims to have advanced 51350
to th e heir, says he will leave nothing un
done to bring him back to San Francisco,
and with as much haste as the law will
permit place him a/d his attorney in San
Quentin if they have imposed upon him.
Mr. Rauer, as it is generally known, is
very unsophisticated and Is easily Im
posed on by designing persons.
He occupies a very unique position in
this case. He has the <istinction of hav
ing destroyed three heirs by a simple as
sertion and of having assured the estate
to the bogus John Sullivan. James Tay
lor Rogers admits that it was Jake Rauer
who persuaded him to retire from the
case* and reach the conclusion that those
interesting nieces and nephew who are
living a peaceful life in Soho Square, Lon
don, are not the children of the unfortun
ate John Sullivan who died many year?
ago. Mr. Rogers says that he had a pe
culiar experience with these Londoners.
They wrote to him from London claiming
heirship of Joseph Sullivan, and on Octo
ber 16. 1899, he undertook their case and
liled notice that he wcruld appear for
them.
Bauer Secures the Estate.
On October IS he sent these people ex
plicit instructions as to the course they
should pursue in proving their heirship.
Mr. Rogers' letters were voluminous, but
he says he never received an answer to
them. Notwithstanding this fact, and
having no reason to believe that he ever
would hear from these people, on May 2.
190>), one day beforo Judge Troutt was to
distribute the estate, James Taylor Rog
ers served his petition for distribution
upon Attorney Ruef and stated he was
ready to prove that the John Sullivan
produced by John Chretien was an im
postor and that the nieces and nephew
were the only legal heirs. The next morn
ing, Mr. Rogers says, he was told by Mr.
Rauer. who was in court representing his
interests in the case, whatever they might
have been, that the nieces and nephew
were impostors and that Mr. Rogers was
being imposed upon.
To prove this Mr. Rauer kindly offered
to go with Mr. Rogers to the Hibernla
Bank and show by the records made there
In behalf of Joseph Sullivan that his par
ents were not the same people whom the
nieces and nephew claimed as their par
ent. Mr. Rogers said he went with Mr.
Jtauer and was satisfied, from a copy of
the record which he received from a.
clerk, that Mr. Rauer was correct and
thereupon the petition of the nieces and
nephew was dismissed. Rogers had seen
the deposition of John Sullivan. It was
therefore very careless in him not to have
noticed that there was a discrepancy be
tween the account given by John Sullivan
of his parents and that given by the
nieces and nephew. The attorney had to
wait all those months, therefore, until
Mr. Rauer cleared his mind of doubt. The
clerk at the bank, whose name has been
used upon the authority of Mr. Rogers,
does not recall the incident of the visit at
all. as he never attends to the depart
ment where deposits are made and could
not possibly have given Mr. Rauer the in
formation which he said he had obtained.
Jake Rauer is quite as positive aa Rogers
"In regard to the estate of Joseph Sulli

he had been at the Hibernla Bank, where

that tho people whom he represented had

Mr. Ruef-I will state further that at
the time the hearing came up it was stat

the facts and knew this man in London,
knew his family and knew the decedent.
A commission was issued, the same as the

was issued to take the deposition of Mar

sition, upon the assurance that Mr. Mar

ed, was dispensed with.- I will state now.
for the benefit of this paper, if it desires
any further information about it, that the
place where Mr. John Sullivan, the person
who is supposed to be the heir, came from
in this State was Evergreen, Santa Clara
County: that that was the address given
to us. and that he worked upon Haggln>
stock farm out near Sacramento. We
verified all these statements. Mr. Bow-,
den. an attorney of San Jose, represented
this alleged heirâ I think Mr. Nicholas
Bowden of San Jose represented this al
leged heir, John Sullivan, prior to the
time that Mr. Chretien represented him as
being the man from Santa Clara County.
This article was published this morning
without any investigation, without having
come to the office of the Administrator or
hi3 attorney, and without having inquired
of a single person other than the anony
mous furnisher of the information to the
paper, who perhaps has no connection
with the case, and whom we do not know.
Sullivan His Own Identifier.
I wish to state also that we have in
this case acknowledgments by notaries of
the signature of this John Sullivan as be
ing the man that he represents himself to
be.^So that in every possible way we
have guarded against the possibility of
fraud, as we do In every case. The Pub
lic-;Adminlstrator, Mr. Drinkhouse, during
his \erm of office, never paid out a dollar
to. anybody for any purpose whatsoever
without being sure that the person to
whom he paid was the proper person.
In this particular case It was reportel
to us that the man was in London, whei:
he finally turned up In California. If w<!
had paid this money out. even if we had
done so fraudulently or otherwise, to any
body Mr. Drir.khouse would have betn
still personally liable for paying it to the
wrong man and not to the person who
was really the heir. We would have been
obliged to pay 1 It twice had we paid it out
wrongfully once. No advantage could
possibly result to Mr. Drinkhouse or to
his attorney from making a false payment
to anybody in a case of this kind because
at any time the full amount of the money
would have been at the disposal of the
true heir had this man proven to be tho
false heir.

the effort to ascertain whether any wrong

The Courtâ 1 have some recollection of
it, but I can't recollect all these things.
Mr. Ruefâ He was upon the stand here.
He was a short, thickset man. with a red

cording to the records of the banks; we
verified those ourselves afterward.
The Courtâ I have an Impression that I
requested particularly that he take the

Mr. Ruef â I recall that circumstance: he
was on the stand.

conspirators, and this paper reiter-
Btes its assertion. As was to be ex
pected, the men who were concerned in
this outrage upon the dead are striving to
Iiiake explanations, but these explana

Perjury in the Deposition.
This deposition is a most remarkable
Bocument. The attorney for the Public
Administrator, Abraham Ruef, admits
that he consented to the taking of the
deposition as a matter of convenience to
Mr. Chretien and his client, the bogus
John Sullivan. When this deposition was
taken John M. Chretien had sworn In a
petition which is on file in the County
Clerk's office that he had made very per
(: istent Inquiry and had learned from the
] ostal authorities of London that no such
man as John Sullivan lived at 34 Soho
Fquare. London, and that if he had lived
there he had prone away without leaving
J.!s address. Abraham Ruef. the attorney
for thÂ» Public Administrator, had learne'3
from the solicitors for the British Consul
cf this city the very same facts. TheÂ»c
lawyers had informed Mr. Ruef that
there were only three John Sulllvan.s,
tailors, in London, and that not one of
them was the one who was Joseph Sul
livan's heir.
More than this, no John Sullivan lived
en Soho Square, which is a street of ono
lilock. Mr. Chretien swore to the court
that between May and August of 1K*3 he
had sent letters and instructions to 34
Soho Square to John Sullivan and had
his letters returned with the announce
ment of the postal authorities that no
such man lived there. With these facts
in their possession Attorneys Ruef and
Chretien examined the scoundrel who rep
resented himself as John Sullivan and
eaid that in the latter part or September
or the early part of October, 1S93, he had
left his home at 34 Soho Square at the
request of John M. Chretien. Strangely
enough the attorneys did not detect the
Ftujiid falsehood of the impostor who was
asking for something which did not bt
long to him.
This bogus John Sullivan, having stated
that he had received at 34 Soho Square,
London, letters calling him to California,
forgot himself and said that he received
these letters at Evergreen, Santa Clara
County, where they had been forwarded
.jto him by the postal authorities of Lon
_#'On. He swore 5n his perjured deposition
That when he left his home at 34 Soho
! Square he had left his prospective address
with the postal authorities and Mr. RuÂ«Â»f
knew that the postal authorities knew
nothing of him ac Cormac & Donohue of
this city, representing the British Consul,
had given him assurances of that fact.
And Mr. Chretien knew that his own let
ters to 34 Soho Square to John Sullivan
had been returned by the same authori
ties and thnt they knew nothing of him
or his whereabouts. Upon this extraordi
nary deposition Attorney Ruef, represent
ing the Public Administrator, and John
M- Chretien, representing the rascal,
agreed that the man who signed the dep
osition was the # legitimate heir. This is
the startling story told by the deposition
which was not in the County Clerk's of-
Imposter Sails for Nome.
More than this, "The Call reproduces

Jivan. They were not written by the same

Mr. Lloydâ In consulting with some of
the members of the bar who have read
the publication we think on account of the
charge that has been made that It is the
duty of the court to thoroughly Investi
gate this matter and in order to do so
properly it must keep control of the case.
As I understand from the statements of
counsel, three days have to elapse before
the decree would become final. I think
therefore it is a duty to the court and to
the members of the bar and to the heirs
of the estate that an order should be made
now setting- aside that decree.
Mr. Ruefâ If your Honor please, the de
cree can be set aside, as I understand it,
any time within six months
Mr. Lloyd (interrupting)â In sixty days
it becomes final.
Mr. Ruefâ In sixty days it becomes final
upon the question of appeal upon the evi
dence. I think It would serve the pur
pose better to make an order to show
cause why it should not be set aside. We
can have it set aside to-morrow morning
at the time the order to show cause is re
turnable.
Lloyd Acts as Court's Friend.
Mr. Lloydâ 1 suggest that a short order
to show cause to-morrow morning be pre
pared and that no longer time be allowed
or the decree may become final.
The courtâ I appreciate very much tho
suggestion of .counsel acting as amicua
curiae. I feel thjt we can set aside the
decree to-morrow morning. I think that
the safer course. I appreciate the sug
gestions made by members of the bar to
the court. It was very startling what I
read this morning In the paper. Of courso
It was entirely unexpected. I am very
glad to be In a position to investigate at
once. I shall do all that Is possibleâ as
others willâ to ascertain whether a wrong
has been committad.
Mr. Lloyd â I will prepare an order.
Mr. Ruefâ Mr. Chretien not only ap
peared under an order, but he has a pow-r
of attorney, which I have In my posses
sion, signed by this man and acknowl
edged before a Xotary Public in this city,
under which he has been acting.
The courtâ Let all of the papers in this
matter be here to-morrow morning and
have notice given to Mr. Chretien aa well
as others to appear at that time.
Additional Pacts Regarding Case.
A few. facts relating to the estate still
remained to be told by Mr. Ruef after
the adjournment of court. In his posses
sion there remains a receipt showing that
so far as "John Sullivan" and his "at
torney in fact." John M. Chretien, are
concerned. Administrator Drinkhouse is
discharged of liability. Here begins the
story and as told by Mr. Ruef follows:
"After the appearance of the alleged
heir," said Mr. Ruef, "who was repre
sented by Mr. Chretien, and within a few
days of the conclusion of the proceedings
that would have resulted In a distribution
to him of the properties of the estate in
my possession, Mr. James Taylor Rogers
appeared as the alleged representative of
foreign heirs of the decedent. This ap
pearance resulted in a delay and Mr.
Chretien and his client became restless
and anxious for money. Yielding to their
constant demands this office advanced
some money and finally, after Mr. Rogers
had withdrawn his application for distri
bution of the decedent's properties to the
alleged heirs he represented. Mr. Chretien
and 'John Sullivan' pave me information
that they had negotiated with J. J. Kauer
for the transfer to him of all their Inter
est in the estate. For the purpose of pro
tecting Mr. Drinkhouse I conducted the
matter of receipts. John Sullivan, the al
leged heir, and Mr. Cnieticn, his attorney
in fact, presented me with a receipt In
which they acknowledged possession of
the distributive remainder of decedent's
estate. To protect Mr. Rauer from loss
foy.the moneys he had advanced, I pre
pared a receipt setting forth that there
had come Into my possession the distribu
tive remainder which I held subject to the
order ol Mr. Rauer. but pending the final
order cf the court after the termination
of the life of right of appeal from the
order of distribution. A copy of this doc
ument I still have in my possession. The
original I gave to Mr. Drinkhouse for de
livery to Mr. Rauer alter the receipt, by
me of the acknowledgment by 'John Sul
livan' and Chretien that Â¦ all due them
had come into their possession. Whether
or not Drinkhouse has delivered this doc
ument tp Rauer I am unable to say. That
matter, however. Is not one which con
cerns this office. Mr. Drinkhouse and
myself have been extremely cautlou3 re
garding this estate, and the expose In this
morning's Call has saved Mr. Drinkhouse
something over $3000 if the allegation that
Chretien's client Is a bogus heir is true.
Heirs' Appearance Excited Suspicion.
'The peculiar appearance of the heirs
In this estate excited my suspicions from
the beginning. I rang up Mr. Rogers
shortly after he filed appearance as the
representative of the three foreign heirs
and solicited his haste in settling the
estate. Tie said that he had not yet made
connections: that he had not seen the Sul
livan- family tree bud before him in a
manner that demonstrated the truth of
his clients' claims, and hence he would
have to stand by his legal rights and de
mand further time. At a subsequent
hearing, however. Chretien informed At
torney Rogers that he could prove that
the foreign 'heirs' represented by the lat
ter were not the heirs of the deceased by
the medium of the records in the Hiber
nla. Bank. Subsequently I was Informed
that Mr. Rogers had withdrawn his de
mand for a hearing on behalf of his al-

said information, affiant endeavored to
communicate with said party, but
learned that said party, who was an
aged lady and thoroughly Ignorant
and unable to write, refused or de

upon ailiaut procured a certified copy
of the order appointing him attorney,

desired information, viz.: That deced

Affiant thereupon sent a certified .

a power of attorney, and all requisite
information and instructions to the
said John Sullivan at 34 Soho

that the said package was returned by

that the said John Sullivan had re

attiaiit communicated with the postal
authorities in the said city of London,
asking for information as to the best
means of discovering the whereabouts
of the said John Sullivan; affiant is
now Informed and believes that as the
said heir has such a common or ordi

possible to locate him without adver

of thp city of London for his where
abouts: afnant is also informed that
this will be a cheaper and more expe

expensive; afnant has incurred con
siderable expense thus far and. will
incur greater expense In prosecuting
nis investigation as to the present
place of residence of the aforesaid
heir; that, in the opinion of the afllant,
it will be necessary to take steps to es
tablish the heirship of said heir, and
to that end to perpetuate the testi

now aged or Infirm, and whose testi

been almost â¢ continuously employed

case that was passed upon by the Su
preme Court, Judge Ross says:
Nor is it of any Importance in view of the
provisions of the statute under consideration
that . the selection here in question may have
been made in the hope of finding oil In the land.
The statute conferring the right of selection
does not make that right in any way depend
upon the intent with which it is made. 'Where
lands are withdrawn and not subject to selec
tion under the act of June 4. 1S97,' they are not
open to settlement, but continue open to ex
ploration for minerals.
. Railroad Case Cited.
Judge Ross particularly recites the case
of the Northern Pacific Railroad Company
vs. Hussey. 15 U. S. A. 391. where a legal
discussion followed regarding a contention
of odd numberd sections of land where
the Kederal court said that some new
condition is always met and that a Just
order or rule known to equity courts was
born of some emergency. Judge Ross
concludes in the following summary:
It results, from what has been said, that un
til it shall be determined by the Land Depart
ment that the tract of land was not vacant and
open to settlement at -the time of its selection
by the predecessor In the Interest of the com
plalnant,'"an equity in that tract exists in the
complainant, which a court- of equity should
protect against euch acts as are here threatened
and comi-lalned of. Accordingly a decree will
be entered in favor of the complainant with a
provision, however, to the effect that should
the I^ar.d Department cf the Government at any
time prior to the. issuance of a patent for the
FPlrcted tract determine that the land was not
vacant and open to settlement at the time of
Its peloctlon, the operation of the decree shall
thereupon cease.
Â¦ This decision will affect thousands of
acres of land in Central and Southern
California located as agricultural land
through scrip obtained from original set
tlers on land afterward declared by the
courts to belong to the railroads. The
most valuable land in controversy which
will be affected by this decision is in the
Kern River country. In effect the de
cision virtually declares that scrip land
claims take precedence over mineral
claims as all of the oil lands are claimed
as mineral lands.
UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE ERSKINE M. ROSS, WHO REN
DERED A MOST IMPORTANT OIL,' LAND DECISION AT LOS ANGE
LES YESTERDAY.
In his review Jud^e Ross continues:
The great importance that the oil industry
has iibsumpil in this State, the enormous value
of oil prcxluclne lands and consequent avidity
with which thry are sought, coupled with the
fart that the iirÂ«>Erent pult will serve as a pre
cedent for others now pending, has caused the
raw to be taken up out of its regular order
to give the questions presented careful con
sideration and to the end that the law upon
the subject may be epeedlly nettled and the
way indicated by whirh the title to such lands
may be acquired and the important industry en
courapod and developed.
The Judge then discusses the features
of decisions and cites over 100 cases that
bear upon the question. He particularly
refers to the case of the Nevada Sierra
Qll Company vs. Home Oil Company. 9S
Fed. Rep. 673, where it was decided as well
as by the land office that indications,
however strong, are not sufficient to an
swer the requirements relating to placer
claims; that one essential condition to the
making of a valid location must be a dis
covery of mineral within the limits of the
claim. While this decision created sur
prise, it was shown to be in strict accord
with the statutes.
. ' Germ of the Opinion.
The germ of the decision is contained in
the following:
Applying tho law to the facts as made clear
; that the location of thÂ» land in controversy by

' amounted to nothinc. for the reason that no

law i.Â« well settled that mere occupancy of pub
lic l?.nd and improvements thereon jrive no
| vested rights therein as against the United
States antl consequently not against any pur

I'nder this condition Judge Ross says
that others had the right to enter upon
the lands for the purpose of taking them
up under the mining laws or to acquire
title by any legal means. After citing a

CasÂ« for the Defendants.
The defendants assert that no title vests
under a selection of forest reserve lieu
land until patent issues or approval of
selection by the Commissioner of the Gen
eral I>and Office. The complainant contro
verts the position of the defendants as to
the character of the land in question at
the time of location and maintains thai
all public lands returned asÂ» agricultural
are vacant and open to settlement when
ever they are unappropriated on the books
of the local land office and contain no
palines or mines or producing oil wells.
Claimed as Oil Lands.
Thousands of acres of land held by set
tlers as agricultural land in Central and
Southern California have been relocated
and are now being held by mineral claim
locators as oil lands.
Judge Ross, in his decision, begins by
quoting the following section of the aci
of Congress passed June 4, 1897:
Xo public forest reservation shall be eÂ«tab
li.Â«lied except to improve an<J protect the forest
within the reservation or for the purpose of se
ourinsr fa\ arable conditions of water flow and i
to tarnish a continuous supply of timber for the i
use aii'l necesnities of the citizens of tbe United
States, but it is not the purpose of intent of
the** provisions or of the act providing- for such
reservations to authorize the inclusion therein
of I;. ntls more valuable for the mineral therein
poees; that in cases in which a tract, covere-3
by an unix-rfeoted bona fiJe claim or by a
patent, la included within the limits of a pub
lic fores-t reservation, the settler or owner may,
if Â»ie des'rÂ»Â» to do so. relinquish the tract to
the Oowrnmcnt and may select In lieu thereof
a tract of vacant land open to settlement not
exceeding ia area the tract covered hy his
<laim i.r patent, provide.] the requirement? of
the laws of residence, etc., are complied with
on the new claim.
Explains the Suit.
JudRo Ross then says that the present
is a suit in equity to quiet the complain
ant's alleged title to lots 1 and 5 of frac
tional northwest quarter section 4. town
ship 4 north, range IS west, in Ventura
County, which the complainant's prede
cessor In interest. J. R. Johnston, selected
under the provisions of the act of June
4. l k '<7. and exchanged for patented lands
within the forest reservation surrenderee*
by Johnston to the Government.
ReeiU.iR the leg-ai operation? of the case
Judsp Eton states that the bill includes
a prayer for an injunction against de
fendants to prevent boring: for oil and
to prevent their entering upon the land.
Th<- answer to this prayer avers that the
land is not agricultural, of little value *or
graztnfr purposes and has no appreciable
value for any purpose except for petro
leum, that may be obtained by borfnp or
drilling, and that it is in a well recog
nized petroleum producing belt and thf.t
adjacent properties in the belt are actu
ally producing petroleum in large and
profitable quantities and that the Bomta
Oil Company filed on these lands through
eight persons as placer petroleum lands
and worked them and their boundaries rs
the law requires. The answer also alleges
that Johnston did not select the lands !n
controversy for their agricultural or graz
ing value, except to ontain the undis
covered petroleum and that the selection
by Johnston under the act of Congress
referred to /or the : purpose stated was
fraudulent and in Violation of the spirit
and purpose of the act under which ne
pretended to proceed.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, July 9.â Judge Ross,
in the United States Circuit Court
to-day, handed down a decision in
the case of the Olive Land anc;
Development Company against W.
II. Olmstead apd others. The suit was
brought to quiet title to alleged oil-bear
ing lands in Ventura County. Plaintifis
had secured an order requiring defend
ants to show cause why they should not
be permanently enjoined from boring ior
oil en paid lands.
The decree is entered in favor of the
complainant.
The case is important in that it upholds
the rights of those who hold lands
through locations obtained by the use of
scrip which lands are known as- lieu
lands.
Tho court affirms that the settling upon
lauds as agricultural claims is sufficient
to hold it even though others should come
along and oust the settler by putting up
monuments and laying claim to the land
as a mineral claim.
Judge Ross Decides That Scrip Land Claims
Take Precedence Over Mineral Claims and
the First Settlers Cannot Be Ousted.
DECISION OF IMPORTANCE
TO HOLDERS OF OIL LANDS
Three thousand Japanese were ' fishing
on the river to-day, but not a single white
fisherman was in sight. There are 700
men on the roll of the white fishermen'3
union at the fishing village of Steveston.
fifteen miles from A'ancouver. - Late- this
afternoon the white men on the Kraser
forced the Japanese to hang up their nets.
The whites and Indians, acting In con
cert, threatened to smash the boats and
burn down the Japanese outfits if the
Japanese made any attempt to go out this
evening. Notwithstanding their superior
numbers, the Japanese were intimidated.
The whites are fully determined that
not a fish shall be taken unless the Jap
anese stand by them in their demand
upon the canners for a 25-cent rate.
Bloodshed was only averted this evening
by the action of .the Japanese In not
clashing with tho order of the white fish
ermen. It remains with the Japanese to
decide as to whether or not there will be
an armed encounter, both sides being
fully armed.
VANCOUVER, B. C, July 9.â The diffl
culties between Japanese and white fish
ermen for the salmon canneries of the
Fraser River are approaching a climax.
The whites, acting under orders from the
union, have refused to go out because the
canneries will not pay 25 cents per fish,
while the Japanese accept the canners'
offer of 20 cents per fish. The result. has
been thaf since the opening of the "sal
mon eeason last week the Japanese have
been In complete control of the fishing.

Jeered clients. That he did so is shown by
the records of the court and by subse
quent events, but the influences that
prompted him to take this action are as
yet unknown to me.
Attorney Chretien Is Silent.
Mr. Chrrtien. after many bu?y hours
Â©ceupk-d down town in no unusual man
ner, that of preparing a defense for him
self, announced by the brilliancy of his
hall illuminations that he was home, but
lint for the purpose of piving interviews.
"I ' have r.'jihimr to say," said Mr.
Ohretie^n, "in response to a. request for
ft statement repardinur his connection with
the Sullivan estate. "I do not care at this
time to commit myself regarding my con
nection with tbe case. I do not know at
lh:s lime arhere my clirnt is. If you are
Bmdofu for a statement you must see
ray attorney. Ttmmaa D. Kiordan. Any
{statement he niay make will be satisfac
tory to me. I must direct you to him. as
at this time 1 can say nothing."
Mr. Ricrdan accepted tbe duty trans
ferr<:-<l to his shoulder* by Chretien with
considerable trepidation. "Mr. Chretien
was here a short time uro and spoke to
rae to relVrÂ«*r;<~e to his eaJse.r said Mr.
Kiordan. "but bavmg just rptnrned from
Pan J'rsc I was too busy to give much at
tention io the snattc-r. He told me that he
had only received $100 from the estate on
account at attorney** f<ep. which rain was
allowed by Judpr Troutt. He said, how
ever, that his <-iient hail received money
from J. J. Hsiuer f'^r his inU-ref-t in the es
tate ur.'l bad gone to Nome. 1 can make
rio statement on h'hslf of Mr. Chretien,
for 1 havo l:ad no opportunity to look Jnttr
his caso, even had I so desired. I am
very bivy in Â£v.r\ J<<?e at the presnt'llme
and will n-it represent Chretien. He mu c f.
;>rocurÂ«- t!:e services cf aoatiser lawyer. I
r.rr. not acquaint**] with the points In
volved in '.his controversy and will not
take tbe time la become acquainted iwlth
the eame. Thai iÂ« all 1 have to say re
garding the inattt-r."
Judge Troutt Expresses Views.
**2f J liav<- bÂ«-"!i Imposed upon; if other
than a legal bdr to the i-s-'tate of Joseph
Sullivan has In en foisted on the court, it
Is tbe boun-ion duty of those aware of tbC
fact io inform me thereof and I am grat
ified that The Call htfs called my atten
tion to the matter," paid Judge Troutt
yefitr-rday. "Tho publication of the alle
gation that puch Is the true condition
came to me like a thunderbolt out of a
clear sJtJT. The business .of this court is
larK<* ami it is difficult to carry its many
details in one's mind. I remember, how
ever, ihat in the hcarinffof the Sullivan
estate matter that the alleged he.ir testi
fied in this court. His deposition- was on
file herein and so far as 1 could see this
transactions regarding the matter of the
distribution of the estate were all regular.
The article in The Call, however, Fh'all
receive my consideration. I have callt.l
the attention of the District Attorney to
the matter and have solicited his assist
ance in bringing the guilty parties to Jus
tice if such there are. 1 have also secured
the services of a detective, one of the
best in the city, to aid me in my investi
gation of this affair. His work will Â©ply
cease when I am convinced that the pub
lished charjrea are untrue or the guilty
partirs are punished in accordance to law.
District Attorney ByinRton will be in
court to-morrow morning and will wit
ness the proceedings. On the result
thereof he will base his conclusions as to
the policy which should be pursued re
garding this matter. The case is one of
importance and will receive the full at
tention it deserves."
Chretien's Incriminating Document.
The remarkable .character' of this con
spiracy which The Call has exposed, and
which in the interest of justice demands
not only the attention of Judge Troutt
but the Grand Jury, is very clearly indi
cated in the documents which were filed
in the case. Some of these documents tell
a very strange story in themselves. But
as incriminating as they are. they reveal
only u part of this crime which is com
mitted upon the dead in Judge Troutt's
court. Trie attorneys were crafty, but
they overreached themselves and had
placed on record in the office of the
County Clerk doc-uments which now ac
oune them. One of those documents, and
one of the most important in the case, is
the petition filed on August 29. ISM. by
John M. Chretien. In this document
Chretien himself submits the proof. of the
fact that no John Sullivan lived at 34 Soho
fqu.'ire, London, and yet John M. Chre
tien presented the claim of a client who
pretended to come from 34 Soho square,
London. This document is* in full as fol
lows:

See our â¢ and 10 cent Haxaar. Hr3t floor.about the Admiral's figures, on the ground
that it would be impolitic to make 'our
needs known to the Chinese, in the first
instance, and also of a desire on the part
of. this Government to avoid being put
in the position of appearing to set up a
standard for the other powers in this mat
ter. It is understood, however, that the
pith of Admiral Kempff's communication
is the necessity of speedy reinforcements
If quick action is desired, and on the latter
point there Is not a dissenting voice
among the Cabinet officers. If reinforce
ments are to be got to China speedily
they cannot come from the United States.
According to the schedule already in, ex
ecution only one steamer, with two bat
talions of one regiment,, has started from
San Francisco, and the next steamer is
not to start before the 15th of the present
month.
This is. about the best time that
can be made with the present facilities,
and at that rate many weeks, and even
months, must elapse before the 6000 addi
tional troops ordered to the Orient on Sat
urday can be landed there.
This state of affairs caused a revival-to
day of the report that General MacArthur
is to be again called upon to relieve the
situation by dispatching from the Philip
pines at least two regiments in addition
to the Ninth Infantry, already sent to
Taku. It was said that the Cabinet con
sidered this subject and decided to give
the necessary orders looking to a replace
ment of the troops withdrawn from Gen
eral MacArthur's command from the force
going out from the United States. None
of the Caoinet officers would admit or
deny this; so it- gained some measure of
credence. Unless Japan is to be left to do
all of the fighting in the immediate fu
ture General MacArthur must respond to
this demand. By drawing upon the Phil
ippine force at least a ' month could be
saved in landing troops in China.
Secretary Long showed this afternoon
how the navy was responding to tho call
for reinforcements by ordering 500 ma
rines to be assembled from the several
navy yards -and hurried to China. It Is
significant that these are the first military
forces to be Bent directly from the United
States to .China without instructions to
stop at Nagasaki for orders. The marines
will make up a force of 750 men, as the de
partment* already has given orders for the
equipment of 250 marines for similar ser
vice. They will be sent out on the first
army transport available for the service.
The Russian and French â¢ Charges and
the Japanese Minister were among Sec
retary Hay's callers to-day. Save the
Chinese Minister they came, as they said,
for information, but It is-surmised that
their object was to assure Secretary Tlav
of the willingness of the Governments of
Russia and France to allow Japan a free
hand in the matter of landing troops in
China ' to quell the Boxer- disturbance.
There Is a suggestion in the air that this
perfect understanding, Initiated by Sec
retary Hay, has ' been brought about
through the quiet acceptance of at least
one most important condition. What this
condition is cannot be learned, though it
Is suspected to relate to territorial acqui
sitions.
Mr. Wollant, the Russian Charge, was
among Secretary Hay's callers to-day.
His mission was concerned with the Chi
nese situation and while no official expla
nation'on the subject could be had, there
is reason to believe that the Minister for
mally conveyed to Secretary Hay the as
surance that his Government was entirely
willing that Japan , should do everything
In her power.to meet the needs of the sit
uation, realizing that she alone of the
powers was in a position to act speedily.
It is impossible to ascertain whether or
not any assurances have been exchanged
respecting the limitation of compensation
for. the task the Japanese Government is
about to assume in the Interests of civili

A Chinese official in high favor with

Baron Hayashi. being asked by a repre

lowed a free hand to settle the trouble?"
replied: "I 'do not understand so, but I
know that Japan is quite willing to do all
In her power to bring the rising to an end,
along with the other powers. Japan is
ready to put 22,000 men into the field."
If any sort of government existed In
Peking the settlement of the trouble
would not present serious difficulties, but
if anarchy prevails the situation would
be serious indeed.
George Wyndham, Parliamentary Under
Secretary of State for War, said In the
House of Commons yesterday that since
1S95 English firms had sold to the Chinese
Government seventy-one guns of position,
123 field guns and 297 machine guns, with
ammunition for each class. He also said
that a German firm In 1899 sold China
400,000 Mauser rifles.
Disastrous to British Trade.
Rear Admiral Lord Charles Beresford,
speaking at Malta at the Naval and Mil
itary Society on Monday evening, said the
trouble in China would be far-reaching
and disastrous in its consequences to Brit
ish trade there. It would be a military,
not a maritime war. and the powers that
could place on the spot the greatest num
ber of troops would eventually have sujf
stantial advantaces. The powers not
consenting to' the open door, particularly
Russia, he declared, would eventually
gain supremacy. He said it was a. pity
that his proposals respecting the reorgan
ization of the Chinese army had not been,
accepted by the British Government, with
a view to the possibility of a general war.
Lord Beresford advocated an imperial
conference, to which all colonies should be
Invited, to discuss a scheme of defense.
Communication Is Lacking 1 .
The Times this morning says: "Some
Chinese officials are evidently desirous to
have it believed in Europe that the lega
tions In Peking are still under, the protec
tion of one section of the Chinese army.
But that only makes it more remarkable
that th^y should not employ the only con
vincing argument by uilowinp direct com
munication between the Ministers and the
outer world. We don't wish to insist too
strongly upon this aspect, but the circum
stantial rumors lack the confirmation So
easily supplied if they are true."

WASHINGTON, July 9. â Developments
In the Chinese situation were cons!dered
by members of the Cabinet at a consulta

LONDON, July 10. 3:23 a. m.â With
the foreigners in Peking probably
safe and amid civil war, with
Prince Chlng on their side, with
the powers united and their forces
constantly increasing, the outlook in
Chin* is now rather more hopeful than it
has been for a month past. It appears
from the cautious statement given out by
Taotai Sixan in Shanghai that the rea
son that the heavy guns bearing on the
legations at Peking were not used Is that
Prince Chlng. who is served by 10,000
troops, seised aJl the artillery ammuni
tion. Shan likewise intimates that Yung
Lu, commander in chief of the northern
army, is associated with Prince Ching in
opposing Prince Tua.n"s ferocious designs
and dictatorial ambition. Shan, who ap
pears to be the sole Shanghai conduit of
Peking news, cheers the foreign Consuls
by those confidential communications, but
takes excessive precautions to prevent the
Chinese from thlnkir.g him friendly to the
foreigners.
The feeling of unrest in the southern
and central provinces continues. The
members of the official classes In those
provinces strive to remain m-utral, with
a. leaning toward the foreigners, until
they shall fee whether the moderate or j
extreme factions will win In Peking, j

Danger of D;lay.
From a foreign viewpoint, the capture
of Peking Is the key to the situation, as
there is a fear, according to the Daily
', Mall's Shanghai correspondent, that de
i lay now means 100 recruits for the Boxers
| for every soldier of the ailies rn the land.
Two couriers arrived at Tientsin von July
1 from Peking. One brought a letter from
Sir Claude Macdonald. the British Minis
| ter, to the same effect as that previously
j received from Sir Robert Hart. The cou
i riers confirm the reports of the death of
j Baron von Ketteler. They say that
Prince Ching is doing his utmost to pro-
J tect the foreigners, but that the native
j feeling against the whites is strong. Two
I higrh officials opposed to the Boxers are
| reported by the couriers to have been as
! sassinated.
Sir Claude Macdonald's letter is dated
four days earlier than that of Sir Robert
Hart.
Empress Dowager's Latest Stand.
A dispatch to a news agency, dated
Tientsin, July 2, says:
"The Empress Dowager, so far from be
ing dead. Is actively striving to prevent
the factions lighting. Prince Chlng has
Informed her that he would rather lose
his hÂ»ad than be constantly obliged to
warn her of the consequences of the pro
longation of the present anarchy. Prince
Tuan is quite willing that Chlng should
be decapitated, but the Dowager will not
allow this. Prince Tuan has decided that
he will take full responsibility. He pur
poses to retake Tientsin and Taku. Out
side of Peking, except in the Pechlli and
Shantung country, the people are su
premely Indifferent."
The Fighting at Tientsin.
However ail this may be. the allies at
Tientsin are having an exceedingly un
pleasant time. The Ia6t engagement of
which news has come through occurred
on July 6. The Chinese artillery opened
j at dawn. Their fire was more accurate
j and their ammunition better, the shells
! exploding with precision and setting fire
to several buildings. II. M. S. Terrible's
I guns again quieted the Chinese, who,
shifting their artillery, reopened the at.
tack in the afternoon, but a thunder
storm - breaking, the Chinese suddenly
quit. The allies Immediately attacked
and drove the Chinese from their works,
but lost thirty killed or wounded In so
doing.
The non-combatants are leaving Tien
tsin, and the opinion of a minority favors
the military leaving- also. Stories of co
lossal Chinese armies gathering continue
to worry not only the rank and Hie but
the commanders, who admit the uncer
tainty of reconnoissances and the com
plete absence of an effective Intelligence
department. Chinese information Is re
ceived with extreme distrust.
It is obvious that, though there are
many thousands of Chinese, camped be*
hind the guns, nothing can be done at
present except to wait the arrU'al of re
inforcements. The rainy season has set
In, and this makes going into the interior
difficult. The country between Peking
and Tientsin in other years has been fre.
nuently flooded. River transport Is al
most impossible and the railway is prac

transportation of the animals across the

After a session lasting several hours, the
executive, committee determined to call a
mass meeting of the street railway men
for this morning and to recommend to
that meeting that the strike be declared
on again. The Central Trades and Labor
I'nion met later and indorsed the action
of the executive committee.
When the strike was settled, on July 2,
there were some mutterings of discon
tent among the men over the terms of
settlement and since that time the dissat
isfaction lias grown daily. Charges wore
made that the company had failed to
keep the agreement of July 2 and a dozen
or more instances were cited tending to
prove that there had been a breach of
faith. Meetings were held at several
places in the course of the week and com
mittees were appointed to procure proof
of infidelity on the part of the company.
At a meeting of the executive committee
<f the Street Railway Men's Union yes
terday a batch of athdavits was present
ed to the effect that outside men had
been employed by the company since July
2 In violation of the terms of the agree
ment of that date.
ST. LOUIS. July 9.â The strike against
the St. LouIe Trar.sit Company by Its
former employes! which was declared off
on July 2. was ordered renewed to-day at
a meeting of the Street Railway Men's
I'r.iun at the West Knd Coliseum. To
morrow morning at 5 o'clock was the time
Jixed for the renewal of the boycott on
all the company's lines.
The whole trouble seems to hang upon
a question of facts, the men insisting that
the company had violated its agreement,
while the company, on the other hand,
emphatically denies that such is the case.
The men claimed yesterday that a
verbal agreement was entered into con
currently with the written agreement and
under the verbal agreement the company
was to re-employ all the old men within
sixty days, seniority in the service de
termining the priority of re-employment.
It was claimed that the Rev. Dr. \V. J.
Boyd had assured the men that such an
agreement existed, in a speech at the
\\ cst End Coliseum. The officers of the
company declare that there was no such
verbal understanding and that the only
agreement made by them was the written
agreement which was pubilshed at the
time.
A member of the executive committee
to-day said that this was the second time
the company had broken faith with its
employes and no agreement would be ac
cepted in the future that did not provide
for the reinstatement of all old employes
within twenty-four hours after the ex
ecution of the agreement.
"There will be no lawlessness or demon

CASE AGAINST
SUSPECT CALEB
POWERS OPENS
Hawaiian Plantation Owners Resolve
to Ceass Temporizing With
the Orientals.
HONOLULU, June 30.â High Sherifi
Brown left on the 26th for Spreckelsvillo
to take part in the trials of the Japanese
who assaulted policemen. The Japanese
assaulted a census taker and then at
tacked officers who went to the rescue.
The case la regarded as an important
one, as giving the Japanese an oppor
tunity to learn that they must show more
respect for the authority of the officers.
By the same steamer a number of
white policemen were sent to Maui on
account of representations by plantation
managers and prominent Maul people
that there might be serious trouble at
any time. The strikes at and around La
naina, followed by the assault of the la
borers upon the United States census enu
merator and the police at Spreckel.sville,
seemed to portend a grave situation.
The Sheriff and the officers returned
yesterday after attending the trial of the
accused Japanese. The men were con
victed and lined $26 and co3ts each.
The plantation managers have about de
cided to temporize no further with the
Japanese. They have increased wages be
yond the contract price, paying as high
as $17 a month, when the contract price
is only $15 a month. They have met every
demand of the laborers. And still the
Japanese will not go to work, or If they
do they quit on the slightest provocation,
though they still continue to occupy
houses provided by the plantations.
The determination has been reached by
some of the managers that the Japanese
must either go to work or leave the plan
tations.
Subjects or citizens of foreign powers
cannot hold office under the government
of the Territory of Hawaii. This Is given
out to-day as the ruling of Governor Dole
and the heads of departments. The rul
ing is based on an ODinion of Attorney
General Dole, which the executive consid
ered to be a correct reasoning.
Under the ruling, a number of popular
officials will be thrown out. Among them
is Andrew Brown, Superintendent of
Water Works; Jonathan Shaw, Tax As
sessor; C. B. Reynolds, Superintendent of
the Leper Settlement; Allan Herbert, a
Commissioner of Agriculture; Dr. George
Herbert, Superintendent of the Insane
Asylum, and probably a dozen others in
Honolulu alone.
Sugar Company Reorganizes.
HONOLULU. June 30.â What is prac
tically a reorganization of the Honolulu
Sugar Plantation has been effected by the
organization of the Honolulu Plantation
Company and the transfer of all the prop
erty of the former to !ts new corporation.
Roth corporations were organized under
the laws of California. The old corpor
ation was capitalized for $900,000. The new
corporation is capitalized for $5,000,000. The
stock of the new corporation is divided in
to 100.000 shares of the par value of J5o.
Of these shares, 81,000 representing a par
value of $4,050,000 have been exchanged
with tho stockholders of the old corpor
ation for their holdings. The remaining
shares, 19,000, are treasury stocks to be
-olrt for further development of the plan
tation. About 11,000 shares are said to
have been sold already. They are being
placed on the market at $35.
Hawaii's New Treasurer.
HONOLULU, June 30.â Theodore F.
Lansing has been appointed Treasurer of
the Territory by Governor Dole. Lansing
has held several Government positions In
this country and Is considered a man of
ability.
JAPANESE LABORERS
GIVE MUCH TROUBLE
Aside from stamp duties the principal
internal revenue collections here will be
for licenses and special taxes on banks,
etc. The duties on cigars and tobacco are
mostly paid on the mainland before the
goods are sent here.
Treasury Agent Thomas Is of the opin
ion that it will be a long time before the
stamp taxes are takeen off.
"I don't think they will be abolished
within the next ten vears." said the In
ternal revenue man. "The stamp duty
has been found to be such an easy way
of collecting revenue that it is well
thought of in Washington. If there is too
much revenue I think the changes that
will be made will be in customs duties."
HONOLULU. June 30.â The national
Government will not jiet a very large sum
annually by the collection of internal
revenues in Hawaii. It is estimated that
the annual sum will be about J200.000,
mostly in special war taxes collected by
means of stanjps. Special Agent Thomas,
who Is at work on the organization or the
new bureau, has looked over the Held and
estimates that aside from the special
taxes and stamps there is only about
$50,000 a year to be collected on the
islands.
Nearly All of This Sum Is Derived
From Special War Taxes Col
,/ lected by Means of
Stamps.
Internal Revenue Receipts
Estimated at Only $200,
* 000 a Year.

Dumas' Brilliant
Comedy Splen

Well Sustained.
"Camille" at the
Alcazarandthe
"Dancing Girl"
at the Grand
Opera-House.
THE great Dumas himself would have
been satisfied to his heart's content
could he have seen tfce representa
tion of his comedy, "Un Marlaga
Sous Louis XV." given at the Columbia
Theater last night. This play Is a high
comedy â one of the fifteen or twenty that
exist in the world's literature: while it
may be played at by au ordinary com
pany, it can really be played only by a
Company of rare intelligence and discre
tion. That Mr. Miller and his friends are
such, last night's performance proved
more amply than, anything they have
heretofore Cone.
For the first time during this engage
ment Mr. Miller allowed 'himself, a part
worthy of his capacity. The Comte de
Candaie fa a role that calls for the dis
play of wit. humor, pathos, sang frold and
above all poise and refinement. The actor
who plays must produce his effects with
out ever "letting himself go." He must
resist the many opportunities which the
part affords of playing at the audience.
His manner most be exquisite, his diction
at once <iuiet and forcible, his emotion
never obtruded yet always felt by the au
dience as something that exists sound and
pure under the man's artificial exterior.
Mr. Miller was all these things ar.d some
thing more; that something which refuses
to yield its secret to the last analysis;
that something which we call talent, the
absence of which, though many other
virtues be present. Iea\-es one man com
monplace: the presence of which makes
another man distinguished. No one, it
seems to me. could have seen Mr. Miller
last night without feeling. "Here we have
distinction."
Mi?s Dale's Marthon wil! be. as the
port's thing of beauty, a joy forever, whose
loveliness srrow? with us: a n<?ver-to-be
forgottea embodiment of archness, dainti
ness and gracefulness. If it had a faultâ
which it had notâ i: was that it was too
good for the author's conception: with
such a maid, the Chevalier could never
have made uj> his mind between her and
the mistress. In the Comtesse de Can
dale Miss Anglin found another ingenue
part, but one that call? for more intellect
ual vivacity than did her part in the
"Tree of Knowledge." She played It, I
tbtak. even mere satisfactorily than she
did the former character, and her dresses
âeven a mere man may be allowed to
Â¦wonder at their brautv and their svrnme
try. Mr. Worthing as the Chevalier took
the first two acts to find himself, but once
found he never lost himself or his audi
eno?. Mr. Walcott as the General showed
another portrait in his long gallery of old
men. all so delightful ar.d each so differ
ent from the rest.
The scenery ar.d costuming were not
only rich. but. what is better, were in ex
quisite taste.
No one who wishes to see comedv-writ

Grand Opera-House.
â¢â¢The Dancir.? Girl." dorse by Henry Ar
thur Jane?, was presented by the New
Frawleys last night at the Grand Opera
House. The plÂ£>' was well staged, more
particularly the third act. which -was ap
plauded (the staging) for itself alone. But.
still the waits are impossibly long-â when
one lives in Oaklandâ and some folks do.
â¢The Dancing Giri" Is a good play, with
some smart lines, ar.d abounding in sit
uations. It is not, a? "The Children of
the Ghetto" was described, a play of. char
acter, but one of incident, worse luck:
That Is. cr.e r.nther wished It were the
ot^er la=t nisht for these reasons.
There seems to be something Infectious
in the Morocco atmosphere, the home of
th* melodramatic microbe, and. "The
Dancing- Girl." with Henry Arthur Jones
and ail the New frawleys. were unable
tc withstand Its overwhelming Influence.
No: that Is not quite true. The Duke
of* Guisebury. as played by Wilton Lack
ave was not melodramatic, but then It
â¢v'aJ not much of anything else. It secm
Â«-d curious to remember the old Rem
brandt picture nf Reb' Shemuel of last
week and see Mr. Laciaye's common
place performance of last evening Mr.
Lackaye should play Drusilla s father,
rot her lover; one wished he would many
times, thourh the part was well enough

her Inland lover. Frank Matthieu, follow

how "her "Give me some tea" drove the

Alcazar.
The revival of "Caraille" at the Alcazar
Tbeater last evening brought out a large
and appreciative acdience. Florence Rob
erts' portraynl of the beautiful but unfor
tunate French wen-.an differs from that ot j
all who have Attempted, thÂ» Fart before â !
and for the better. Srie has eliminated
from the last ret the distressing con

Exciting Two-Thirty Trot
on Opening Day at
Napa.
KETV YORK. July 9.â James J. Jeffries
will not fight Gus Ruhlin. This decision
wa3 reached to-day at a meeting at which
the fighters, managers and stakeholders
were present.
Jeffries' injured arm Is at present In
bandages and the elbow joint is under the
treatment of a physician. "When the fight
ers met to-<Jay eacb side thought that a
match would be made and a date set for
some time in August. Al Smith held iÂ£50O
of the champion 3 money and was ready
to receive a like amount from Ruhlin as
a forfeit. Kuhlin was ready to put up the
money, but refused to to so when he
found that there was a condition attached
to Jeffries' forfeit money. Jeffries would
fight on any date provided his arm -was
well enough, but if not the forfeit taoney
was to come down. Ruhlin and hla man
ager refused to enter an agreement of
that kind. They said:
"Make the match, put up a forfeit, and
if for any reason eitner man fails to en
ter the ring on the given date let the other
take the forfeit."
No satisfactory agreement could be
reached.
Seeing no chance to f ght for th? cham
pionship, Madden and Uuhlin tur^i their
attention to making a watch with the next
best man. Bob Fl:zsimmons. They met
with immediave success. Fitzsimmons
wanted a fight and. next to Jeffries, would
rather fight Kuhlin than anybody. He
Â¦was ready to talk business at once and
to-morrow th-e men will meet and arrange
the details of the fight. -A3 for the date.
Ruhlin is ready to nsrht at any time, the
sooner the better, and Kitzsimmons wants
the battle to come off the first week in
August. Fitzsimmons will begin training
ai once for the bout.
Jeffries says that he thinks his arm will
be ready for ring use by Augnst ii and it
RuliUn beats Kitzsimmons and wants a
tight with him between that time and Sep
tember 1 he can get it. He also says that
when fighting Is stopped in this State he
will fisht In California or Nevada.
The club offerinar the biggest purse or
the greatest percentage of the gate re
ceipts will get the Ruhlin-Fitzsimmons
fight.

The writer begins by saying the number of Chinese
secret societies now :n existence is endless, and that
most of the stories told about them by travelers are
trash. Comparatively few of the societies are op
posed to the present dynasty, but one of the most
influential of the few is that of the Boxers. He then
A few days ago we presented a summary of a state
ment of the aims and objects of the Boxers, given to
the London Express by a Chinese merchant living in
England and who chimed to speak with the authority
of membership in the brotherhood. According to his
statement the "Boxers" are patriots, loyal to the Chi
nese Government and to Chinese civilization, and
opposed to foreigners only because the foreigners
have attempted to stir up religious strife among the
people and in other ways disorder the empire. A
different view of the brotherhood is presented by a
correspondent of the London Chronicle, and as he is
indorsed by that journal as an authority on Chinese
matters, his statements are worth noting.
OUT of the deep obscurity of the Chinese mass
the so-called ""Boxer"' brotherhood has sud
denly risen to an eminence that renders every
bit of information concerning it a matter of interest
to the world. In response to the desire for more
knowledge on the subject there has been forthcoming
an infinite variety of opinions and statements, often
conflicting and very rarely aiding any one to obtain 1
clearer conception of the mysterious society.

*ifl devirc some scheme for having the district
clÂ«.r:eO r.T the expense of the city. Thev would be
ter- u-niins to shift the burden from their own
pocket* to that of the taxpayers, and no doubt can
7*-! forth msny specious reasons why that should be
Cone. It is even probable that in the end it may be
deemed wise for the community as a whole to deal with
the evil by reconstructing thi whole district. That
however, :Â« something tar off. The immediate issue
i< the simple one of enforcing existing health crdi
rnrÂ«ct:s in Chinatown as they are enforced elsewhere.
That can be done bv refmirins the owners of nroo
rrtr there to do their duty as it is done in the city
federally. That is the step to be taken now, and the
sooner it be taken the better for all concerned.
We repeat that the movement for reform should b
directed toward the owners of the property and not
ibward the r.rrest of the tenants. Little or nothing
ran be pained bv arresting a lot of Chinese for living
â onsamtarr quarters. The:r conviction would
rixnply entail imprisonment and support at the ex
pense of the taxpayers. The owners of the property
can be made to clean up the buildings to prevent
evercrowdmp. to close up tne underground pnsssge*
brncatl; the premife?. and. in short, to establish all
the reform* rcr;v.ired by the law. The issue is up to
them- and they must not be permitted to shirk it.
BUSY as our people may be in making prepara
tions lor the coming political campaign, they
have not forgotten, nor will they forget, the im
j>ortant local issue of providing for an immediate
cleaning of Chinatown. On that subject there arc
no lonsrer any differences of opinion outssde the com
paratively small class who arc owners of Chinatown
buildings, r.r.J who in their folly believe that an en
force::'.rnt of the sanitary regulations of the city will
be. an injury to their property. Until the work of
clearing she .'istrict has been carried out systemati
cally and thoroughly there will be no cessation of the
rotation on the. subject. The reform is one of ur
gent necessity and must be undertaken without delay.
Were the members of the Board of Health wise i:i
their generation they would by taking prompt action
toward the cleaning of the Chinese district endeavor
to make some atonement for the wrong done to the
uhole community by the senseless bubonic scare and
quarantine. The members of the board arc aware of
the foul condition cf the district They have U in
their power to. compel an obedience to the healtn
laws, but for some reason they have neglected to
exert the power. It is. then, to the Grand Jury the
people turn with expectation of action. From that
body there should speedily come complaints against

PERSONAL MENTION.
Thc*e sideshows were all disappointed when the
managers of the main circus secured the new freak,
Webster Dans. He is justly regarded as the finest
Iivinf: specimen of the "Injun rubber" man. and
either of ;he sideshows would have been glad to add
hira to its greatest living curiosities.
The other principal sideshow "was the Bimetallic
League, of which that atrabilious statesman, Warner
of Ohio, is president. It is as a sweat bee in size com
parcvi to the l>ig show, but is noisy out of proportion
to its bulk. Its sessions were principally occupied in
mutual denunciation. Warner was a reaiTirmationist
en the Chicago piatfoim issue. For this the reitera
tionis:s denounced him as a "t-c-r-r-a : i-t-o-r" to the
sacred cause of the divinely appointed ratio, and he
had to strip his arm and show his 16 to 1 birthmark
to hold on to his membership in the combine.
Senator Teller spoke until he was too hoarse for ut
terance, but there were so many willing and in gooa
condition to utter that he was not missed.
THE SIDESHOWS.
WIIlLIi the Democratic circus was showing
under the main tent at Kansas City the sidc
shows did a good business. One ol these was
the Silver Republican convention, steered by Teller.
It was a noisy aiTair, and most of its noise was made
for the nomination of Towne for Vice President.
Fighting talk .\a^ often indulged in, and once sleeves
Â»ere r<>;icd up for a set-to on the floor, but Mr.
Waters of Kansas poured water on the troubled oil
ar.d manor*, quieted titwn.
Fortunately for us the advantages we expect from
the exposition arc to be gained by our industrial dis
play and not by the national building. If we can
make a market for more of our products we shall for
get the failure we hive made in the way of architec
ture. Moreover, we are to have an exposition of our
own at St. Loiiis within the near future, and with the
memory of the wonderful White City at Chicago in
mind, can count on St. Louis to accomplish some
thing that will redeem our fame as builders. All the
same, we may be wise in not talking very much about
our national display at Paris.
"It is a boxlike building, opening freely from a
rotunda. A poor imitation of the National Capitol
dome surmounts the structure and a golden eagle
spreads his wings toward the Seine. The building is
not national; it is not harmonious with its surround
ings, and it is cheap and tawdry. The interior deco
rations are flags and cheap, conventional* American
shields, apparently of pasteboard. The slight hand
rails around the platforms of the stories opening on
the rotunda are of eighth-inch strap iron, such as i>
ufed in foundries to make tees and angles. The bal
ustrades are of cheap red plush, harsh to the touch
and flimsy and inartistic in appearance."
All that is comforting to State pride, but for our
national patriotism there is little in the way of ex
ultation. The national building is reported to be al
most a disgrace. Dispatches from Paris some time
ago described it as inadequately furnished, and now
comes the correspondent of the Freeman's Journal
ar.d condemns the whole thing. He says:
We have had. indeed, fairly good reports of Califor
nia's exJiibits. It is slated they are all in place and
have attracted much attention; that in many respects
they excel those of all other countries. We are faF
ahead of any of our sister States in fruits, woods and
minerals, while our wines have not only surpassed
those of any other American State, but have been of
such excellence that the French judges have refused
to permit them to coirpcte with French wines of the
same names.
' YEN the most casual observer of the passing
show of events as recorded in the press must
* have noted that the great American eagle is
not screaming so loudly over the American display at
the Paris Exposition as might have been expected.
We miss the gladsome, buoyant boasting of "how we
beat everybody else in the world, to which we were
accustomed when former exhibitions were in full blast.
This failure may be tine to the fact that we have be
comc blase on expositions, or that we arc too busy
with politics to talk of Paris; but there is reason to
fear that it is due m&lnly to the fact that thus far we
have had very little to brag about except the success
of Sousa's band playing ragtime melodies.

The Board ot Health no lonper has th* tup
port and confidence of this Board of Super
visors p.nd for the best Interests of the com
munity at large we dÂ«>em the removal of its
members from their of flee necessary and ' the
Mayor is earnestly requested to see that their
offices are declared vacant forthwith.
The indefinite postponement of the reso
lution prevailed by the votes of Booth. Box
ton, Brandensteln, Comte, Connor, Curtis.
d'Ancona, Dwyer, Jennings and Tobin.
The Acting Mayor cast the deciding vote
in this case also and so saved the dav for
the Health Board. Hotaling. McCarthy.
Reed and Sanderson voted against indefi
nite postponement and Helms was ex
cused from voting.
Sanderson moved to strike out all the
paragraphs in the resolution except the
last which reads:
"I believe that this resolution should be
voted upon." said McCarthy. *"I am of
the same opinion as I was when I intro
duced the billâ that plague has never ex
isted in this city: that the attempt to fast
en it on the community was a swindle, ami
that the irreparable injury done by the
Health Board's action demands the In
stant resignation of its members."
Tobin Interposed a mild objection, but
cast the deciding vote, explaining that he
did so on a written recommendation of
Judge Coffey in favor of Finn, which hid
been read earlier by Comte.
The recommendation of the Health and
Hospital Committee that McCarthy's res
olution calling upon the Board of Health
to resign and reciting the reasons therefor
be indefinitely postponed was opposed by
the author.
Supervisor Booth, chairman of the Com
mittee on Printing and Salaries, started
the ball by introducing an ordinance ap
pointing Thomas W. Doyle to the position
of stationery clerk, at $125 per month.
Booth explained that the position requ.red
a man of experience as to stationery and
in bookbinding and printing. Doyle pos
sessed the required qualifications. Booth
said. Jennings stated that the position
was in reality that of "expert to the print
ing committee," and that only a compe
tent man could fill it. Connor said that
he had another name to present, but
would not do so until action regarding
Doyle's nomination had been taken. Every
one knew that Connor referred to John F.
Finn, whom Pheian had been trying to
force on the Printing Committee for sev
eral weeks past.
Urandenstein asked that the names of
all the candidates be presented so that an
opporunity would be given to the mem
bers of the board to compare the aspir
ants. The vote was first taken on Doyle,
but he failed to get a majority vote. He
was supported by Booth, Boxton. Hotal
ins. Jennings. McCarthy, R^ed and San
derson. Against him were Brandenstein,
Braunhart, Comte. Curtis, d'Ancona,
Dwyer and Helms. The vote on Finn was
then taken with the same result, those
who voted against Doyle voting for him.
A motion to reconsider was made possi
ble by the addition of the votes of Boxton
and McCarthy. The vote on the ordinance
appointing Finn then showed Branden
stein. Braunhart, Comte, Connor, Curtis.
d'Ancona, Dwyer, Helms and Boxton in
favor. Ten votes being necessary Braun
hart jumped to the rescue and rising ex
citedly said:
"I move that the Acting Mayor be not
excused from voting."
That all Is not harmony in the Phelan
camp was demonstrated yesterday, when
several Supervisors refused to be dictated
to in the matter of appointing his Honor's
choice for stationery clerk of the board.
The proceedings over the attempt to pay
one of the Mayor's political debts further
demonstrated that when Phelan does
small politics he throws aside the merit
system, which the civil service provision
of the charter Imposes on the municipal
povernment. That the opposition to the
Mayor's driving methods was well defined
will be understood when it is known that
the vote of acting Mayor Tobln was re
quired to consummate the deal. It waa
Braunhart, too, who insisted on Tobin re
ceding from his se!f-imposed custom of
not \ r otlng on any measure, and thus the
ex-Senator began to repay his absent chief
for his recent appointment.

Â»
The Board of Supervisors adopted sev
eral measures at its meeting yesterday
which are preliminary to the acquisition
of a municipal water system. The plans.
as outlined by the resolutions, contem
plate an immediate Inquiry by the
Board of Public Works into the cost
of the Spring Valley Water Works sys
tem; the appropriation of $500 for an in
spection cf Lake Tahoe and Yuba River
systems and the investigation of the vari
ous sources of water supply Â¦which nave
been submitted with a view to ultimata
purchase by the city. The resolutions
were all Introduced by Chairman Reed of
the Committee on Public t'tilitles and
were unanimously adopted. The first res
olution says:
ThÂ» City Engineer and the Board of Publla
Works are hereby instructed to begin immedi
ately an investigation of the cost of the work*
and machinery of the Spring Valley W ater
Works actually used for supplying San Fran
cisco with water; that Is to say. what la tha
worth of the tangible property of the Sprlr.tf
Valley Water Works independent of the coat
or value of the water rights and lands.
The Committee on Public Utilities wa3
directed to commence an investigation ia
the month of September of the cost and.
value of the property of the Spring \ alley
Water Works ; and to continue its session.*
until next February, with the view of pre
senting an ordinance tlxing water rates
for the following year.
The sum of S5>m was appropriated to pay
the expenses of the Board of Supervisors
and the Board of Public Works in the in
vestigation of the Lake Tahoe water sys
tem and the water sheds of the north, ana
south forks of the Yuba River. .
All proposals submitted to furnish San
Francisco with a water supply were or
dered referred to the Board of Public
Works for the investigation of tnosa
deemed worthy of consideration.
The City Engineer was directed to mako
plans and to turni-h estimates of the ac
tual cost of the original construction ana
completion by the city and county of wa
ter works having their sources of supply
In Lake Tahoe. the forks of the American
River, the forks of the Yuba River ana
the Feather River.
The Board of Public Works was re
quested to make monthly analyses of thÂ©
water furnished by the Spring Valley
Water Works until the rains begin.
The publication of an article in last
Sunday's Call to the effect that "the
Board of Supervisors has no power to di
rect the expenditure of moneys for any
specific purpose out of the park Improve
ment fund, but that the Park Commis
sioners alone have exclusive control of
the fund." prompted Supervisor Boxton
to Introduce a resolution askin? for tha
City Attorney's advice on the subject.
The resolutioh recites:
Whereas, This beard let aside In the budget
for this fiscal year the sum of |3>*) for the

The Board of Public Works recommend
ed that granite curbs and artificial stone
sidewalks be laid on the four corners of
Vallejo and Stelner sfreets and that the
roadway of the crossing be paved with
bituminous reck.
The City Street Improvement Company
was granted permission to repair with bi
tuminous rock the roadway of Sansome
street between Sutter and Bush.
A resolution was adopted providing for
the full acceptance of the roadway of the
crossing of Twenty-ninth and Tiffany

the budget for said departments..

erty which might have escaped taxation

City Hall and other public buildings at

ed to the Independent Electric Light and
I'ower Company. That to light with gas
the City Hall and certain engine houses
went to the Pacific Gas Improvement
Company for $1 S3 per 1000 cubic feet. The
contract to light with gas certain public
buildinps was awarded to the San Fran
cisco Gas and Electric Company at $1 35
per 1000 cubic feet.
It Â«f erred to Committees.
The following petitions, communications
and protests were referred to committees:
From superintendent of the California Home
for Feebleminded Children, transmitting a list
of commitments from San Francisco and other
data.

The original ordinance, extending the
limits to the county line, was defeated.
A resolution was Introduced by Braun
hart providing that a parcel of land situ
ated at Fourth and Clara streets be trans
ferred from the School Department to the
Police Department, and that the sum of
$25,000 be set aside fronv the general funa
for the erection of a police station upon
the described lot. The resolution, which
was referred to the Police Committee,
calls attention to the fact that the south
ern police district Is not provided with a
station, that the district is one of the
most thickly populated in the city and
that the needs of the Police Department
urgently require that some place shall be
provided therein where a patrol wagon
may be located and persons under arrest
detained.
Miscellaneous Business.
The Auditor was authorized to appoint
fifty extra clerks, at a compensation of
$100 per month each, for a period not to
exceed thirty days for the purpose ot
making out the duplicate tax list.
The payment of !23f>3 to help liquidate
the expenses of the Fourth of July cele
bration was authorized.
It was resolved that all demands for
stationery, books and printed blanks fur
nished the Board of Fire Commissioners
and. Board of Health be charged to and
per cent of the claims amounting to $84,000
as they did not care to be subjected to
hopeless litigation.
"All the creditors have signed an agree
ment." said Mr. Bennett, "to discharge
the city from all obligations on that basis.
Batcraan Brothers have also signed the
agreement and we are ready to give the
city a clean receipt."
Establishing Pound Limits.
An ordinance was passed to print, estab
lishing a public pound and providing for
the extension of the pound limits as fol
lows:

Tfoe writer's advice as to what should be done with
respect to the brotherhood is curious in the light of
what has happened since his article was written. He
says: "Let them alone. Whatever you do, let them
alone. If they are left unmolested they will not mo-/
lest Europeans, but. on the contrary, if we attempt to
crush them, or insist on striving to convert their
members to Christianity, we shall not merely fail,
but in all probability our missionaries will be put to
death with great cruelty. The Boxer Society bears
a striking resemblance to a great nest of hornets.
Leave the nest undisturbed and you may pass it with
impunity fifty times a day. Stir it up thoroughly only
for a moment, and eVery hornet in the nest will at
The writer estimates the number of Boxers at about
4,000,000 ten years ago. and says the society is known
to have increased since that time. The recruits arc
not always volunteers. Frequently persons are either
decoyed into the order or are brought in by force and
compelled under threat of torture to take the oaths.
There are some 333 orders in the society. It is divided
into five great lodges, and the governing body is a
council composed of the presidents of the five lodges.
It has no grand master or single executive head.
The Chinese Government has repeatedly endeavored
to suppress the order, but ha* never come anywhere
i-car success.
goes on to say: "These Boxers are in reality a
branch of a brotherhood universally dreaded in China
as well as in Singapore, Penang, Northern India and
in parts of the United States, and known as the Sam
Hop Wui; while among the European population of
Canton, Shanghai and Peking it is usually alluded to
as the 'Great Triad Society. 1 This society, called also
the Hung League, and known by many other titles
as well, has been in existence so many hundreds of
j'ears that its origin is lost in obscurity. Originally
it would seem to have been a society on a par with
our own Freemasons, for its chief object, accord
ing to the society's 'Excellent Words of Exhortation/
was first and foremost to foster brotherly love, unity,
harmony, equality and. freedom. These high and
laudable aims have been completely neglected by the
latter-day Boxer, who, to speak it plainly, is merely
a corrupt and cruel ruffian, determined to stick at
nothing in the way of crime and villainy and trusting
to his fellow Boxers to shield him from the long arm
of justice."
Republicans will remember his campaign made in
California in iSoS. in which he labored to stir up sen
timent in favor of grabbing the Philippines, which he
invariably pronounced "Fhilippians." He will no
doubt star as a spellbinder for "William Brennings,''
and old Boeras should inflate the lungs of him and be
prepared to meet a new competitor.
The adoption of the platform was immediately ami
appropriately followed by a speech by J. Webster
Davis, in which he indorsed it and announced that he
would support "William Brennings" for President.
He had only been in the party twenty minutes. anÂ»I
his tongue was already so thick that he could not
pronounce the name of its candidate!
Political purity is demanded by a convention which
unanimously admitted Senator Clark of Montana to
a seat, against a content.
We denounce the Philippine plank in the Kansas
City platform as ambushed secession or deliberate ie
ccption. intended to mislead the opponents of expan
sion. It raises a theory under which its promise can
not be kept, except by dissolving the Union, so that
if the party get power the frantic expansionists in the
South, who control it. can compel the country to keep
the Philippines or dissolve the Union.
We [ repose to fight against such an alternative, as

Mr. Van Wyck's anti-trust plank has upon it the
hoar frcst of the ice trust.
The anti-expansion sentiment of .the country is
large and influential, but it will not support a platform
; nd theory that makes it identical with secession.
That sentiment denies that the constitution follows
the tlag:. because it denies that the Philippines are in
alienable. It desires to alienate them, and looks fof
rard to a reaction that will demand such alienation.
But anti-expansionists do not propose to dissolve the
Union in order to alienate the Philippines, and there
fort prefer the conservative and tentative declarations
of the "Republican party.
As to the unhappy legacies left by the Spanish war,
which the makers of this platform urged and into
which they nagged the country, the platform is insin
cere and inconsistent. It declares that the constitu
tion follows the flag, denounces the giving of a gov
ernment to Porto Rico, and declares that we must
give a government to the Philippines first and then
independence. It will require much ingenuity to ex
plain why it is a political crime to give government to
Porto Rico, and an equal crime not to give a govern
ment to the Philippines. Again, if the constitution
follow the ting, we take it that not even Senator Ti!i
man. who is so solemnly devoted to constitutional
rijriits that he murdered negroes for claiming them,
will deny that the treaty of Paris put the Hag in the
Philippine?. This is beyond denial. The platform
says that the constitution followed. Therefore, that
territory is now under the constitution as much as
South Carolina is. Yet this remarkable platform
promises to alienate t'ns Philippines and give them in
dependence. It requires no constitutional lawyer to
see that, if they arc under the constitution, to alienate
them is a dissolution of the Union, and if they are
given independence how can alienation and indepen
dence be denied to South Carolina or any other part
of the Union? When such a platform is prepared by
Tillman, who recently said in the Senate that 95 per
cent of the Southern people arc yet in favor of seces
sion and sorry that the Union was not dissolved, ably
assisted by Jones of Arkansas and other proponents
of the doctrine of secer sion. it is well to proceed with
caution in dealing with its constitutional theories.
What man among them all can put up a logical de
fense of the platform against the charge that behind
a denunciation of imperialism it ambushes a revival
of secession and proposes a policy that dissolves the
Union?
It confuses money and currency, demands that the
treasury be used as a bank, and ignores all that science
and experience have discovered of the natural laws,
which precede statutes in the selection of money and
the circulation of currency. O
Such fractures of logic, divorce of premise from
conclusion and sense from sound, abound in this out
burst of rage. Everything that is is wrong, and
Bryanism was born to set it right. The gold. stan
dard Jaw is viciously attacked, though it has reduced
interest on the national debt to 2 per cent, and our
bonds at that rate command a premium. No nation
c\er had as high credit as ours, under this law. Now
will any man of sense give any good reason for de
nouncing it as a crime? Is high interest on the na
tional debt desirable? If so, the Kansas City con
vention, that yelled against the gold standard till the
waters of the Kaw nearly turned upstream, is right.
Is bad public credit, that puts our bonds at a discount
instead of a premium, a desirable condition? If so,
the platform is a statesmanlike document.
The Kansas City platform denounces, the Dingley
bill as devised to give favors to the few and put bur
dens upon the many, and then denounces the Repub
lican party for not extending the Dingley bill to
Porto Rico, declaring that failure to do so has
doomed the Porto Ricans "to poverty and distress."
Therefore the Democratic remedy for poverty and
distress is to give favors to the few and burdens to
the many!
THE BRYAN PLATFORM
THE country will not be immediately, nor
deeply, impressed by a platform laudatory of the
constitution, read by Senator Tillman, and with
an anti-trust plank reported by Van Wyck of New
York and cheered by Dick Croker. Laying it along
side the Philadelphia platform, one is struck by the
contrast. The Kansas City document denounces and
destroys. The Philadelphia affirms and constructs.

ating a Scene.
Former Judge Trendwell was ordered
into custody yesterday morning by Judj?e
Fritz for contempt of court. He was kept
in the City Prison till 2 o'clock in the
afternoon, and was then taken to court.
The Judge asked him if he had anything
to say, but he rhowed no pign of making
an apology, and the Judge fined him $50,
with the alternative cf five days in the
County Jail. J-r. ter a writ of habeas cor
pus was applied for before Judge Murasky
and it was granted, bail being fixed at
$25, half the amount of the fine. The bail
was forthcoming and Trcadweli was re
leased.
Trcadwell was defending L. Brogamonte,
an East Indian, who was charged by Po
liceman Ilagpettwith carrying a concealed
weapon in the shape of a dagger, which he
was nourishing on the water front on Sun
day. Treadwell claimed that the defend
ant was a traveler and therefore entitled
to carry the weapon. The Judge differed
with him and convicted the defendant,
ordering him to appear for sentence to
day.
* '.'\Ve will take our sentence now," shout
ed Treadwell.

fendant is fined $30, with the alternative of
fifty days."

said the Judce quietly, but Treadwell re
peated the offer and brandished his cane
in front of the Judge, who ordered Bailiff
Conlon to arrest him for contempt.
"You can't arrest me in court," roared
Treadwell. but Conlon took him by the
arm and led him to the prison.

STRATTON LAW
SUBMITTED TO
SUPREME COURT
Â»
Decision Awaited in Case
of Britton vs. Election
Commissioners.
Counsel Agree to Waive Argument
and Appeal From SÂ«awell's Opin
ion Will Be Considered
on Original Briefs.
The case of Brltton versus the Board of
Election Commissioners, involving the
validity of the Stratton primary election
law, was before the Supreme Court yes
terday on appeal from the decision of
Judge Seawell rendered a year ago. The
court agreed to a stipulation of the at
torneys to submit the case without argu
ment on briefs nled when the appeal was
taken.
Morris M. Estee, Gavin McNab and
City and County Attorney Lane were
present as counsel for the Election Com
missioners. P. P. Deering of Alyrick &
Deering. and L. A. Gibbons, appeared for
the appellant. Senator Stradon, the
author of the law, was not in court, but
several other well known Oakland at
torneys were there, among them being
Congressman Metcalf and former Judge
Emli Nusbaumer. t ormer Supreme Court
Justice Van Fleet and VV. b. Treadwtll
were also present.
All of the inemDers of the court were on
the bench except Justices Oaroutte and
llenshaw. F. ,i-\ .Deering informed the
court that in view of the Importance of
the question Involved and the highly tech
nical nature of it, the counsel had all
ajjreed to submit the cause on the briefs
already .tiitd. He said those briefs had
been prepared with very great. care and
that no decision of the court had been
rendered since they were tiled that would
make new briefs or oral discussion neces
sary. He asked the court to dispose of
the case en bane, without referring it to
the commissioners, as all the decisions in
recent important election cases had been
written by the court.
\V. B. freadwell asked that he be per
mitted to say a few words on one point,
supplementary to appellant's brief. Chief
Justice Beany! said that as counsel of
record had submitted a brief it would be
necessary for him to present his argu
ment in the same form. He would be al
lowed live days in whl.ih to submit a brief.
Judge Estee requested that the court
decide the question as early as its con
venience would permit. In answer to
a query from the court. Gavin McN'ab
said that the date for primary elections
under the law would be August 14.
W. II. Abbott of the Attorney General's
office stated that on behalf of the At
torney General he wished to urge the im
portance of an early decision. Their of
iice. he said, was besieged with queries
from County Clerks all over the State
asking advice as to whether they should
proceed with preparations for primary
elections under the act. Boards of Super
visors throughout the State were waiting
for the Supreme Court's decision as to
the law's constitutionality.
Judge Seawell's decision, rendered a
year ago. was in favor of the defendant,
upholding the valadity of the Stratton
primary law and denying the petition of
the plaintiff for an Injunction to restrain
the Board of Election Commissioners
from proceeding with the' city primary
election under it. The decision was a
pro forma judgment and an appeal was
taken at once and the briefs Hied on
which the case is now submitted. The at
torneys for the appellants sought to have
the, case advanced in order to stop the
city primary election for which prepar
ations wore then being made, but the
court did not deem the local election of
enough importance to advance the case.
In view of the approaching State elec
tion the court advanced the case for the
hearlnp yesterday. The case presents the
legal tangle of a petition for an injunction
to prevent an election that has already
been held, and on the face of it only the
costs are involved. In reality, however,
the constitutionality of the law was at
tacked, and a decision on that point is
what is sought.
. Attorney Trfadwell will have five days
to file a supplementary brief, after which
the opposing 1 counsel may take five days
to file an answer. Counsel on both sides
expect an early decision.
AUXILIARY SCHOONER AEOLUS BUILT FOR THE INTER
ISI.AND TBADE.
NEWS FROM THE
OCEAN AND THE
WATER FRONT
New Auxiliary Schooner for
the Marshall and Caro
line Trade.
Epidemic Among the. Natives of the
Aleutian Islands â Newport's
Engineer Has a Narrow
Escape.
.Another auxiliary schooner for the in
terisland trade is almost ready to sail for
the Marshall Islands. The Aeolus Is 150
tons net burden, 100 feet long, 24 feet 6
inches beam and 10 feet deep and has aux
iliary gasoline power that will drive her
at least eight knots an hour. She has
been built for the Jaluit Commercial Com
pany of Polynesia and is almost a sister
ship to the Queen. of the Isles, now in
port. The latter vessel has been a regu
lar trader among the islunds for nearly
two years and is now here for an over
hauling.
The Bio Brings Little News.
The Wueen of the Isles will not be ready
to sail for a couple of weeks, so nearly
all her crew of kanakas deserted yester
day and joined the Aeolus. The ftitter
vessel will therefore go out fully manned
with a crew that will stay by her. while
the Queen of the isles will have to hunt
a crew which will Insist on being paid off
m Jaluit and sent back to San Fiancisco
at the expense of the vessel. Captain
Weilbacher will command the Aeolus.
The Mail steamer Kio de Janeiro arrived
from Chinese. Japanese and Hawaiian
ports yesterday morning early. She left
Hongkong before the riots broke out and
in consequence brings little or no news
of the doings of the Boxers. The passen
gers tell ot trouble anticipated, but the
news that has since come by wire has
more than covered the anticipation.
The Klo brought to port sixty-three
cabin passengers, thirty-nine second cabin
and 102 Chinese. She was delayed at Ho
nolulu owing to the amount of freight
that had to oe discharged. Furthermore,
she was seven daya coming up, a rather
long trip for a Mail boat.
Among those who returned on the ves
sel was Lieutenant Commander Charles
Sperry, U. S. N.. who has been on duty
at Manila and at the North Asiatic sta
tion. Kev. W. P. Chalfant and wife, whp
have spent some time in the Orient, and
F. W. Dohrmann were also among the
cabin passengers.
Newport Arrives From Panama.
The Mail boat Newport from Central
America brought no news of the fighting
in the State of Colombia. Everybody had
to be under cover at Panama before 10
p. m., and all stragglers were jailed.
Shore liberty on the Newport was stop
ped, and not a line on the state of affairs
in the country could be gained by either
officers or men.
Enrique Pepper, a member of the Ham
burg-American Packet Company at
Guatemala, arrived on the Newport. He
says that the coffee season is about over
and that the prospects for good times
were never bettor in Nicaragua, Salvador
and Guatemala. " 'Â¦
While the Newport was at San Jose,
Chief Engineer fc'auben had an experience
he will not forget in a hurry. An elec
trical storm came up while tne ship was
at anchor and a "fire ball" nearly turned
the chief engineer's hair white. It was
not a meteor, but a ball of fire tnut
seemed to shoot out of a nearby clo u<1
and made Sauben's face turn livid, so
close did it pass to his head. Mr.bau
ben does not want any more nre bans
in his.
Sailing of the Nippon Maru.
.The departure of the Toyo KUen
Kalsha's steamer Nippon Maru this after
noon will be notable for the number or
naval officers who will go away on her.
No less than thirty-seven captains, lieu
tenant commanders and lieutenants will
go out on the steamer and thirty-seven
more are to follow on the Kio de Janeiro
All of them are to report to Admiral
Remey on the China station and later will
be as-signed to ships at Hongkong and
other Chinese points. Among those who
will leave to-day are Lieutenant Cam
mander R. H. Gait. Lieutenant Com
mander J. C. Fremont. Lieutenant Com
mander J. C Colweil and Lieutenant
Commander AV. H. Haisey. When Com
manders Gait and Fremont get aboard
the Nippin Maru to-day they will find
two of their old comrades in arms await
ing themâ Captain Nat I. James of the
Naval Reserve and Captain Fletcher, U.
S N., retired, and the gentlemen named
were all members of the class of 'Tl, and
the two latter leave their headquarters
In San Francisco. There are only few
members of the class of '72 left and these
four when they meet to-day are sure to
have lots of school-day stories to tell.
Abbie M. Deering Libeled.
John Skinning and five other members
of the crew of the American schooner
Abbie M. Deering filed a libel in the Unit

the schooner to recover $391 20, alleged to
be due as wages.

The United States revenue cutters
Golden Gate and Hartley will no longer
all be in service in the night time and will

Captain "E. F. Taylor of the well known
firm of Taylor. Adams & Pritchard re
luinea to c>aii Francisco yesterday after
a sojourn of two months In the East.
When he left here it was his intention to
be gone three weeks, but the seductions of
Cape Cod and the blue-fish kept him In
New England and only gave him a chance
for a flying visit to Chicago. Captain
Taylor is still of the opinion that Cali
fornia Is the finest State in the Union and
that Maine runs a good second.
The steamer Homer arrived from the
Seal Islands via Cape Nome yesterday.
When she got to St. Paul there was an
epidemic among the Esquimaux so the
supolies could not. be landed. At St.
George a similar state of affairs existed,
so nearly all the provisions sent north by
the Trading Company are still on the
ship. So many of the natives were sick
that there were none left to handle the
boats. The last epidemic among the
natives was about six years ago and at
that time a great many of the Esquimaux
died.

What England sought In vain In the far
north â gold and silver â Spain secured In
the south when she secured a footing
there. The natives of Mexico and Peru
dazzled their Spanish assailants with
quantities of these metals and the con
queror soon laid his hand on the sources
of supply. The mines, of Peru especially,
were rich. To enable America to pour
untold wealth into the lap of Spain only
labor was needed, and It was soon found.
What we see now in South Africa, where
the mining Industry Is almost dependent
upon native labor, was true of America in
tho sixteenth century- The Spaniards
were hard masters; they held the con
qutred In an iron bondage and forced
from them cruel work in the mines. Bit
ter was the hatred of these new-made
slaves for their oppressorsâ ft hatred that
flamed out sometimes In bloody massacre.
Not only in the minea was enforced toll
required. In the West India Islands and
on the adjacent coasts it was found that
the new world had tobacco and other rich
products of her soil to offer to the old.
Here, too, labor was in demand. It is
a tragic fact that soon after the advent
of the Europeans the natives of the isl
ands began rapidly to die off. Far across
the South Atlantic the villages of bouth
Africa were thronged with black men.
and In Africa, even early In the sixteenth
century, the Spaniards began to seek the
labor supply for America. Thus arose the
negro slave trade, with Its heritage of
tangled problems so real at the present
dav
The Pope's imaginary line of division
from north to south gave Brazil to Por
tugal, and all the rest of Central and of
South America to Spain. Philip II's quar
rel with England became acute by 1564,
when, for many agprc?sive acts against
his commerce upon the seas, he laid hand*
on all the English ships In his ports and
threw hundreds of Kngiish sailors into
Spanish prisons. Many of them perished
SIR JOHN HAWKINS
as heretics, condemned by the inquisition.
International law had hardly begun to
exist at that date, and both sides, in time
of peace, did things that to-day we should
condemn as piracy. No unprotected ship
was safe upon the ocean, and as the sea
going commerce of Spain was immeasur
ably greater than was that of England,
the English seamen had the wider range
of chances to secure prizes. Spanish gen
tlemen were in time of peace sold at auc
tion at Dover to the highest bidderâ not
to be kept as slaves, but to be held for
ransom, in the manner of the Sicilian
brigands of our own days.
Spain had declared from the beginning
that no other country should trade with
her colonies, and rigorously enforced the
decree. Men will, however. In defiance of
laws, buy and sell where they can make
a profit, and to the Spanish coasts of
America Englishmen from time to time
found their way. The most memorable
of these was John Hawkins. Negro slaves
were much in demand in America. The
Spanish Government made slave traders
take out a high-priced license, pocketed
besides a heavy import duty upon every
slave brought Into the colonies, and in
1553 turned the trade Into a monopoly
granted to one man. John Hawkins saw
his chance, slipped down the west coast
of Africa in 15C attacked native villages,
not without bloodshed, and. in the end.
sailed away to America with some hun
dreds of negroes under his hatchways.
The Spanisrj bought the slaves on the. sly,
for they were cheaper than the ones upon
which the regular duty was paid. Haw
kins got from Â£100 to Â£200 for each of his
negroes, and went back to England with
enormous profits for the sharers in the
enterprise. Queen Elizabeth herself
Joined In it. Hawkins repeated his ex
ploit, paid 60 per cent profit to the part
nerrf and became the be3t-talked-of man
in England.
Spain protested: Hawkins, of course,
was disavowed, but he fitted out a new
expedition, s\r.d on October 2. 1567. secretly
left England en a third slave-dealing ex
pedition. With him was a young relative
of twenty-two. Francis Drake, destined
to leave "the greatest name in the naval
historv of the sixteenth century.
The third voyage was a disastrous fail
ure. Negroes were indeed secured and
carried to America, and some were sold,
but the Spaniards were alert as they had
not been before. Hawkins, though his
country wag not at war with Spain, at
tacked more than one town which refused
to trade with him. and for a time carried
matters with a high hand. At last he ap
peared before the harbor of Vera Cruz,
the most important seaport in Mexico, de
manded leave to victual and repair, and.
to insure his operations, seized the Island
at the entrance and mounted cannon
which commanded the roadstead. Span
ish treasure ships were there, but Haw
kins was no pirate; and apparently seized
nothing but what was necessary for his
own defense and to enable him to trade.
The very next day a Spanish fleet of thir
teen ships appeared before the haven.
Parleying followed. Hawkins could have
kept the Spaniards out, but in the end
they entered the port on the understand
ing that he was to be allowed to complete
his victualing and repairs.
The Spanish fleet once within the port,
what happened was perhaps Inevitable.
Upon the English the Spanish looked as
pirates, with whom faith need not bÂ»
kept: the English, on the other hand,
rested on the agreement made. In over
whelming strength the Spaniards : at
tacked Hawkins' few ships and there was
a bloody struggle, well sustained by the
English. The odds were, however, too
great. Hawkins and Drake in the end
with difficulty made their way out of the
port with two vessels. They lost every
thing else, including many men and much
property.
For a time Hawkins was kept busy in
Enerland as treasurer of the navy, and
Drake became leader In the attacks on
Spain. Hawkins was a trader, and a fair
ly honest one. Drake, on the other hand,
was resolved to rob the Spaniards when
ever he could. He. was? not a pirate, for
he usually acted with the sanction of his
sovereign and conducted himself as her
representative. In fact, though not In
theorv. there was war between England
and Spain during the whole of Drake's
active career. He accepted the fact, and
did not trouble himself about the theory.
The Spaniards to avoid the dangerous
straits of Magellan were accustomed
to bring the gold and silver from the
mines of Peru up the Pacific coast, across
the Isthmus of Panama on muleback.

haps he was the first Englishman who
saw the Pacific, for the Spaniards had
hitherto excluded all other nations from
that coast. Drake vowed to go thither if
possible. He returned to England with
a rich booty, but not without Severn
losses, and in 1577 was ready for a su
preme effort.
Drake set out with several ships. Teach
ing the Straits of Magellan and sailed
through that ilang^ous channel in six
teen days, himself going ahead in a small
boat to act as pilot. An awful storm
greeted him In the Pacific. By this time
he had only one ship left. Mhe Golden
Hind, which was swept Into the far south.
battling with the winds for no less than
fifty-three days. No great continent, it
was clear, lay south of the Straits of Ma
gellan. When the storm ended Drake
continued his toute up the Pacific coast
and entered harbor alter harbor, to th-Â»
amazement of the Spaniards, -who had
hitherto found It hardly necessary to pro
tect these ports. It was the precious met
als and jewels that he was after, and ha
seized them wherever foundâ to-day rob
binp a port, to-morrow a ship overtaken
on the high seas.
His hold .stuffe.l with treasure, the prob
lem for Drake then was how to get back
to England. At the south the Spaniards
now were planning to fortlfv the narrow
places in the Straits of Magellan, and
were waiting to seize him when he should
try to paxs through. He was too weak to
face them with success, and he knew it.
so he headed his ships northward, hop
ing to find the western entrance to the
channel that Frobisher was 8eekir.gr on
the Atlantic side and thus to get home.
AVhen we think of the thousands of miles
of ice-bound sea through which he would
have been obliged to pass we smile at so
naive a plan. As he went north the
weather grew bitterly cold. He landed
somewhere on the coast of California,
made friends with the natives, raised the
English flag and named the country New
Albion, thus claiming the western coast
of North America for his country long be
fore she had planted New Kngland on the
east. Then he made M3 boldest stroke.
He determined to reach home by sailing
across the Pacific to Asia and by working
his way thence around the Cape of Good
Hope. Only one voyage had as yet been
made around the world, and its leader.
Magellan, had perished on the way.
Drake set out. did not se* land for sixty
eight days, nearly lost his ship by run
ning on a reef, but in the end reached
the Cape and sailed up the west coast
of Africa. In September. liSO after an
absence of three years, the Golden Him!
was back in England, having made pr<*>
ably the most remarkable voyage on rec
ord. From that day the horizon of the
English sailor was widened to Include the
navigable sras of all the earth.
Drake and Hawkins lived to attack
Spain again, but in 1590 their pioneer worK
was over. They had done something to
make America better known. Drake went
farther south and farther north In the 1 a
cific than had rone any other known mar
iner and Cape Horn and some i/*) miles
of the North Pacific coast were first re
vealed to Europe by him. Yet his school
of action really did little for discovery. It
was animated by a fierce religious and na
tional passion agair.st Spain. To breaK
down her monopoly of trade in America.
to Injure her an<Â« profit by her loss, were
the ends that Drake and later voyagers
like Cavendish and Richard Hawkins had
before them. They were no colonizers; not
a single settlement did they plant.
The real pioneers of English colonization
were Sir Humphrey Gilbert and 1 Sir \\ al
ter Raleigh. Gilbert, who had added New
foundland to Elizabeth's realm in 1583. was
Raleigh's half-brother, who was carrying
out only part of a great schem* to c.lonize
America. The rext year the English flag
was raised in Virginia by an expedition
which Kalelgh sent out. Glowing accounts
of the country reached England; a second
colony followed, but the great naval
struggle with Spain, which resulted in the
defeat of the Armada, absorbed English
energies. The settlers were abandoned and
most of them were murdered by the In
dians. Lord Raleigh turned his attention
to Guiana, in S/>uth America. He. too.
dreamed of finding in thcsÂ» tropical
swamps untold wealth in gold. Legend

plan of colonization, sank to the level of
the mere gold-seeker. He was the last sur-

New York Metal Market.
NEW TORK. July 9.â Iron and steel markets

NEW TORK. July 9.â Not much impression
was produced on the stock market to-day by
evÂ«-nts and the professional contingent, which
conducted practically all the transactions, fell
again to very Rmall proportions. The larger
volume of dealings and the more important
r>;*TJi.t<>rs which characterized last week's mar
ket were rot in evidence to-day. The failure
of last week's attempt to attract outride ln
terrst In thÂ«- mark* by bid. ling- up prices seems
to have \wen a satisfactory demonstration to
that element that the |Â«eriod Is not ripe for
active ppeculation. Nevertheless the price
movmrnts of the day were quite wide, -owing
to the small floating supply of Btock. The un
dertone of the market, too. v.aÂ« unmistakably
firm. Even the Fharp break in Brooklyn Trans
it, which stock led the market in point of
activity, had very flight effect on the general
list, although a fÂ»-w large izalns in special
stocks were yielded In sympathy with It.
Brooklyn Transit at the low point was 5*ic be
low tie high i>oint. The nock shov.e'l feeble
resistance to the d<--clin<\ the bears apparently
turning the eours* of the stock as they chose.
There wae tio new* to explain the decline, but
rumor* were prevalent of. a poor statement of
earning-* to t# made in the forthcoming re
port. The other local traction stocks were
alÂ»o under pressure. Metropolitan sell ing. at one
time four point* under Saturday, but rallying
three. Illinois Central rose at one time 3Sc
and dealing* In the stock were quite large.
Unofficial reports that the Â«tock Is to go on
a 6 per cent bas-is- were responsible for the
riw. J>iuiFvlIle phowH good recovery on the
a'ithori7"d announcement that to-morrow's dlv
ident declaration is to he on a 4 per cent yearly
I .â¢..-.' The grain carrying roads were well
taken all day in anticipation of to-morrow'*
monthly crop rf;>r.rl. which is expected tn fhow
the improveJ condition from rains in the North

on the Â«*cre of the Insignificant Increase In

CHICAGO, July 9.â The trade In wheat was
fairly active and rather nervous because the
monthly Government report is due to-morrow.
That it will reduce the Spring Wheat Is accept
ed as a fact. The. market opened easy, Sep
tember Uii^sc depressed. This was because
Liverpool was lower and there was cooler
weather In the Northwest. Following that the
tone was firm. Liverpool, which had 'shown
some loss early, recovered and closed %d per
cental improved. Corn was strong. These two
factors, with Corn the more influential, caused
a steady but rather quiet advance which suf
lered few checks. Tnese were, by no means
startling. The market lor September clamber
ed tu M'.ic and closed tirm vie over Saturday at
81c. â¢
Corn was active and at time broad. Every
thing offered was bought. Dry weathec in
Kansas and other portions 1 * of the corn belt, *
2-cent advance for spot at Kansas City and
insignificant country acceptances were the
causes. September closed *s<f/ 1 ,4<s up.
Oats followed Corn for the most part. Sep
tember closed vÂ«c better.
Provisions sympathized . with the Corn
'strength. The Hog market was steady and re
ceipts at the yard moderate and there was an
absence of influential selling which last week
was fcomewhat tiepreFslng. September Pork

INSANE MAN
IS SCALDED TO
DEATH IN BATH
*
George Morss. Once a Promi
nent Lumberman, Meets
Horrible Death.
Â»
Lies Under Boiling Water "While At
tendants Go to Aid of Patient
Who Jumped From a
Window.
?
OAKLAND, July 9.â George Morss. an
eld resident of Alameda who has been an
inmate of the State Hospital for the Insane
at AgnewB for two years, was scalded
to death in a bath tub there yesterday
afternoon and the attendant in charge, a
man by the name of Allen, has been dis
charged, though he was exonerated from
any criminal blame by a coroner's Jury-
The body of the dead man has been
brought to Alameda, where the funeral
will take place.
Morss was at one time one of the
j largest lumber dealers in San Francisco
I and lived in Alameda. Some years ago
i he lost a great deal of his money. He
suffered a stroke of paralysis and then
his mind and his health be^an to fall.
His condition became so bad that about
two years ago he was sent 10 the Agnews
~sylum. His mind gradually left him and
he became a total wreck.
Allen was ordered to sive Morss a bath
yesterday afternoon, and two Inmates
were detailed to assist him. According to
the testimony that was given at the In
quest this mornlnjr by Allen and all con
cerned, the water ran a little cold at first.
Allen then turned on the hot -water full
| head. Just as this was done an insane in
j mate by the name of Tillison jumped out
of a window and committed suicide, and
Â¦ Allen explained that he rushed to the as
| slstance of Tillison, leaving Mor?a in the
i care of the two inmates who had been
f ordered to assist him.
j When Allen returned to the bathroom
he found his patient dead and the body
very badly scalded. The doctors testified
that death had resulted from a stroke ot
apoplexy that was caused by the shock
from the hor water. But the doctors alsa
explained that Morss .was in such a phy
sical condition that the asylum authorities
had been expecting his death at almost
any moment, ami that death might have
come with even a slight change in the
temperature of the water.
The body was very badly scalded how
ever, and the best that could be said was
that the scalding had come after death. |
Th*Â» jury did not find a charge again.- 1
Allen, but the as-ylum authorities at once
discharged him from the Institution.
Morss, Allen further explained, was i
paralytic and utterly unable to help him
self, and he could not hare f,usied the
water off by himself owing ia fiis con
dition.
When Allen returned after trying to as
sist Tillison he at once realized the fright
ful condition of things. He hastily
dragged Morss from the tub and sum
moned doctors. Morss' body from the
waist down was boiled till the flesh was
practically cooked. The doctors did all
they could for him. but he died at 10
o'clock after terrible suffering. Coroner
Kell held the inquest to-day and a ver
dict of death from accidental scalding
while taking a bath vras returned by the
jury. â¢ Â¦:::- Â¦

OAKLAND, July 9.â "Walter Morosco.
theatrical impresario. Is In mourning over
the slaughter of his entire stock of much
prized Belgian hares. 100 pedigreed bucks
and does with all kinds of blue jlood.
The rabbitry on Mr. Morosco's country
place at Fruitvale was like a shambles
this morning when one of the keepers
went out to the inclosure to attend to the
valuable pets. Every one of the long
eared occupants had been slain and in a
manner most mysterious. The keepers a3
well as Morosco are deeply puzzled to
know how the hares lost their lives. It Is
not known whether dogs broke in and
played havoc with the caged pets or
whether they were killed bv some human
miscreant.
The police have been asked to Investl
trate the crime, which deprive* Mr. Mo
rosco of his $1500 worth of blue-blooded
stock. Among the slain was Brit Ladd.
a Lord Briton buck, valued at 5250. Helen
Grant, a magnificent doe. was another
famous hare which was killed.
The owner does not believe that dosrs
were responsible directly, because the
rabbit hutches were proof against ingress
of any animal of that kind, unless some
person had opened them. The pens are
wired and the gates locked with heavy
spikes, making it impossible for a dog to
reach the har*Â»s unless the gates were
first opened. These were found closed
this morning.
Morosco regrets his loss "xc^edinsrly
and he declares that he will solve the
mystery of the destruction of his pets If
it takes all summer.

morning with two sub-tenants who occu

and is now nursing a lump or. his head
abont the size of one of his rists. He
went to> the Receiving Hospital, thinking
that his skull might be fractured, but
Dr. Bunnell assured him that he had no
need for alarm. Then he hastened to the
warrant clerk's office and secured war
rants for the arrest of Mrs. Emma Jones.

"I want to get rid of these people."
said Vreeland, "as they are an annoy
ance and will not pay their rent. They
live in the basement and rent it from
Mrs. Hamilton, my tenant. vÂ«ho has been
trying to get them ejected. I went there
this morning and the woman would not
let me in. I forced open the door and she
struck me with a broom. I seized, her by
the arms to prevent her striking me
again, and while holding: her her daugh
ter came behind me and struck me on
the head with a club, breaking my hat
and raising- the lump you can see. The
blow was a stiff one and if it had not
been for my hat I guess my skull would
have been cracked."
Mrs. JoneÂ«. whose husband is a painter,
and her daugher Maude were arrested
and booked at the City . Prison. The
mother is a little wiry woman and Maude
had her left arm In a sling, as she had
a sprained wrist. Mrs. Jones said that

threw her against the bed in her room
twice and tried to choke her. Maude,
who Â«as in bed. h^ard her scrtams and
ran to her assistance with a police
man's club which was in the house. Vree
land let go of her and grabbed hold of
Maude, who struck him on the head with
the club. He took the weapon from the
girl and hit her across the back with it.
Mrs. Jones got hold of the club with the
intention of using It upon Vreeland. when
he beat a hasty retreat. Mabel, a daugh
ter 8 years- old. had meantime run out
of the house to get a policeman, but could
not find one.
As Mrs. Jones complained that she had
a baby at home, Judg-e Mogun was a3ked
to release her. He questioned her in the
prison. She admitted that she owed two
weeks' rent to Mrs. Hamilton, and also
that she had Wt without paying- her rent
In a house on Seventh street and previous
to that a house on Fifth street. The
Judge declined to release her except on
the usual bail, and she was returned to
the matron's rooms.
There wa< a row at the hous? Sunday
night and Mrs. Hamilton asked Police
man J. A. Ryan to interfere. Ryan went
to the house and. he says, advised Mrs.
Jones to pay her rent, but Mrs. Jones
said he told them that they would be

Annexation to the United States Is being

a report received in the State Department
from Consul General Guemher in Frank

protective tariffs of European countries.
which exclude Swiss goods, leading Swiss
statesmen to look about with a view to
forming close relations with some other
Government. Mr. Guenther incloses this
extract from the Allgemeine Scweizer
Zeitun?: "
"In spite of the dark si.leÂ« which are
also found there the United States is full
of the air of freedom. Switzerland would
lose nothing if she should become a State
of the United States of America. It is a
well-known fact that several States of the
American Union are much more Inde
pendent than several cantons of Switzer
land, and our country by such an alliance
would sacrifice none of her liberties. AH
she would have to do would be to s=enJ
her representation to Washington. Eco
nomically and politically, she would gain
everything.
"It remains to be se^n what Americans
would sav about an alliance with Switz

to g-ain a foothold in Europe. Every citi

LITTLE GIRL NEARLY CRACKS
LANDLORD'S SKULL WITH CLUB
NIAGARA FALLS. N. Y. July ?.-Petor
S ton' of Chicago, or "Mr. Bowser." as
he styles hirr.sÂ«-lf. went through the
whirlpool rapids of Niagara Fails to-day
fn the prcsÂ«?nci? of about MJ66Q persons on
bis craft, the Fool Killer. The boat was
towed to a rock about a mile above the
rapids and secured. The point was diffi
cult to rcarii by officials frcm either the
American or Canadian Fide wha might
have lx*.-n disposed to interfere with the
adiectur.T.
Shortly after ; o'clock Mr. Bowser was
*Â¦Â«-* r. on his boat. A ilttie later James
I * Wand pulled up la a rowboat and
lowed the Fool Killer, with Bowser
aboard, into the current. At 3:57 the start
down stream was actually commenced.
but the fickle eddies kept the Fc-ol Killer
drifting about until 4:jo. v.nen she got
into the "whirlpool current anJ started for
the final plunge. Parsing uncer the Can
tilever bridge the boat took on tne speed
< : an express train. Bowser threw his
oar fax frcm him and waved his cap. The
crowd saw the craft raise on the crest of
a smooth wave and then dive into tht?
leaping spray a.nd disappear, 'lne sirarige
craft turne'l over aj^ij over like a top,
rolling and plunging until it passed a b^nd
in the nver. and the most perilous part
of the journey had been passed. Trie
buoyant craft kept on the crest of the
waves until submerged ap.iin on the verge
cf the whirlpool. Shooting Into the
whirlpool the Fool Killer swung around
and went down !ike a fishing bob, but rose
again quickly. For the next fifty-five miii
uies Bowser and his boat cireied around
the whirlpool. Shortly before 6 o'clock
th* Foci K.iier was carried out to the
edge of the rapids and a line was thrown
by Bowser iÂ» men on shore, who hauled
him out. His first Question was, "How ia
that for Bowser?"
The Pool Killer is twenty feet long and
four fÂ«-et deep and 1* made of two-inch
pine, with four air-tight compartments.
The keei weighs 1250 pounds.
Bowser wanned hixntelf at a fire built
on the shore and put on dry clothing and
appeared to be little the worse far his mad

BOLD BURGLARS
ENTER A HOUSE
IN THE MISSION
â¢
Force Front Dcor and Mak<
a Thorough Search
for Booty.
Â«
Failing to Find Anything of Valu
They Almost Wreck the Place.
Detectives Are on Their
Trail.
?
The police are anxious to locate a brao
of daring burglars who have been operat
Ing in the Mission. During- the past fev
weeks they have entered a number o
private dwellings and got away with val
uable booty.
The latest victim of the crooks i;
Thomas Bulger, an engineer In the Flr<
Department, who lives with his family or
Elizabeth street, between Noe and Cas
tro. One the night of July 4 during th<
temporary absence of the family burg
lars forced open the front door with t
jimmy and thoroughly ransacked tht
house. Bureau drawers an-1 trunks werÂ«
broken open, closets were forced and ever
the mattresses were ripped upen, no de
termined were the desperate housebreak
ers not to overlook anything of value.
Before leaving hf-r homÂ«*. Mrs. Kulgei
wisely deposited her valuable diamond!
with a friend: Otherwise the crooks wouk
have come into possession t>t them. Tht
detectives who arc working on the cas<
are of the opinion that the burglars wen
aware that Mrs. Huljr*r was the happj
possessor Of some costly gems, and that
their object in ripping" open the muttresse?
and prying into the bureau drawers anc
closets was to secure the coveted stones.
Failing to find the diamonds, the dis
appointed house bnakcrs. in order to tx
revenged, destroyed a miscellaneous as
sortment of crockery and glassware.
They took with thÂ«m several trinkets ol
r.o value e:x<.-Â»i>t to the family.
The burglary was not discovered until
the following day, when the family re
turned home. Mr. Bulger at once notified
Chief of Police Sullivan, who detailed two
of his best meu to apprehend the burg
lars.
From a boy. who>e name the police re
fuse to divulge, the detectives obtained
a good description of the house-breakers.
The boy was standing- near the Bulger
residence Â«>u the night of the burglary
and saw the crooks leaving the house.
Up 5ayÂ« that they were both young men
and were rather tastily dressed. The boy
is 5atisflÂ«?<i th.-U he. will be able to iden
tify them in case they are arrested.
From the description given of the two
men the police bclie\'e that they are the
burglars who have recently been operating
in the Mission and Western Addition.

a blanket to smother the flames. The
draught caused by running fanned them
and she could not open the tent flaps and
was In a dilemma when she thought of
rolling on the ground. In a few moments
she had exting-ufsh^d the fire, but not be
fore all her garments except some under
wear had been burned.
Mrs. McCarthy was found lying uncon

CANNOT RECOVER THE
PRICE OF THE ANNUITY
ju .Â¦Â¦â¢>-;;";\;V': â ; â . . Â¦Â¦*
Suit Against an Insurance Company
by the Heirs to the White
Estate.
Judge Seawell has decided the suit over
the annuity of the late Jonathan L.
White, who was kilkd in the Baldwin Ho
tel fire, by sustaining the demurrer of
the insurance company to the complaint
of the executor..
A few months before hi? death "White
purchased an annuity of $3*500 a year from
the Mutual Life Insurance Company of
New York, paying S53.SS3 for it. When
he died so soon after Charles G. Geb
bardt. his executor, brought suit to re
cover the purchase price of the annuity.
The defense was that there was a con
tract between White and the company,
which terminated on the death of White,
and that the company had fulfilled every
obligation.
Judsre Seawell took that view of the
case and sustained the demurrer. '

David Davis Cnarged With Burglary
on an Indictment of the
Grand Jury.
David Davis managed to keep out of the
way of the police for some months, but
yesterday he was arrested In Oakland by
Policeman Riordan. He was brought
across the bay and booked at the City
Prison on a Grand Jury indictment charg
ing him with burglary. Chief of Police
Hodgkins of Oakland found Davis among
a lot of tramps In prison there and noti
fied the police on this side.
Davis and Thomas Dougherty were ar
rested las.t December by Riordan for
breaking into a room in Mrs. Erby's
lodging house. 246 Sixth street. The cases
were assigned to Judge Treadwell's court
and the men were held to answer before
the Superior Court. Treadwell changed
his mind in regard to Davis and wanted
Riordan to reduce the charge to petty
larceny, but he refused. Mrs. Erby was
then induced to swear to a warrant for
petty larceny, and Treadwell released
Davis on his own recognizance. That was
the last seen or him till yesterday.
Dougherty was tried in the Superior
Court and acquitted. He stated in court
that Davis' friends had paid $80 to get
his -case "fixed" - in Judze Treadwell's
court, and the matter was laid before the
Grand Jury, the Indictment being the re

vices, which will be brief and very sim
ple, in accordance with â¢ Dr. Cogswell's
wishes. A funeral emblem, wrought in
white blossoms, will be placed on the cas

ers. The others will represent the Society
of California Pioneers.
Dr. Cogswell was a '49er. After teach
ing school, working In a cotton factory

BERNARD GALLAGHER, at one
time one of the leading carriage
manufacturers of this coast, passed
away at the Waldeck Sanitarium
Sunday night. His death was the resuit
of an operation performed Friday even
ing. He was unable to recover from the
shock. Deceased was 73 years of age it
the time of his demise. He had been ail-
Ing during the last four months and was
compelled to seek medical treatment. The
physicians in attendance deemed an oper
ation necessary to prolong his life, but
their patient was too old and feeble to
recover from its effects.
Mr. Gallagher was an early settler on
this coast. He came from Rochester, N.
Y., where he learned his trade, that of a
carriage maker. On his arrival in this
city ho opened a place of business on
Mission street, near Beale, and after
building up his patronage and amassing
a fortune he retired. During the last
fifteen years he had devoted his attention
to his private interests.
Deceased leaves a wife, two brothers
and a sister, all residents of this city.

residence, corner of Van Ness avenue and
Turk street, to-day at 9 a. m. A special

veloped that even Hanna himself was at
one time employed to catch the culprit.
Last week a large robbery was reported
to the California-stret station and Officer
Leonard was detailed on the case. Ho ob
served that Hanna was wearing an ex
pensive sweater and he also had Infor
mation that the young man was spending
more money than his salary as a clerk
would warrant. Saturday night Leonard
told Special Officer Porter of his suspic
ions against Hanna and a close watch
was kept on the latter's actions. Leonard
concealed himself behind some boxes and
Porter called upon Manna to guard the
market while he stepped out onto' the
street. "When Porter passed out Hanna
stood apainst the counter of the cigar
store and commenced playing a harmon
ica. While holding the instrument with
one hand Hanna reached the other
through the grill work rising from the
counter and opened and emptied the
till. The musical instrument was equipped
with a number of bells, which ho clanged
continuously. This was to drown the
noise of the bells that rang when
the wrong keys of the till were touched.
Leonard arrested him and he confessed
to five successive crimes committed in the
place.

mUCH that Is interesting and
amusing has developed as an
aftermath to the arrest of R. M.
Hanna, the "musical thief,"
otherwise known as "The Spider," for
robbing a till connected with Baron's
cigar store in the California Market early
Sunday morning. The stealings of the
prisoner are supposed to have stretched
over a period of four years, during which
time he has been employed as a detective
to catch himself. In all that time crime
after crime alarmed the police, but they
were not, until Sunday, able to solve the
mystery or land the criminal. It was due
to" Police Officer E.F. Leonard, whose beat

On "many occasions during the four
years cash registers In the different mar
ket stalls have been robbed and tills emp
tied of their contents. Altogether the
amount stolen amounts to hundreds of
dollars Baron, at whose stand the thief
was captured, admits that he alone lost
over $200. The regular police detectives,
as well as private sleuths, have worked
on the case. The amusing fact was de-

Registrar Walsh is not satisfied with
the slow way in which citizens are coming
forward to enroll themselves on the Great
Register. Up to date only 13,000 out of
72,000 have registered. The registration
for the general election closes on Septem
ber 26. and for all to be able to vote ap
plications will have to come In at the
rate of l')00 per day. Under the new Smith
law, however, each citizen must be â¢regis
tered twice. This makes exactly double
work for the Registrar's officials, and at
the present rate the prospects are that
there will be a big rush to register at the
last moment.
Registration Too Slow.

meeting last night and selected the follow

FOKTY-THIRD ASSEMBLY DISTRICT.
There were two meetings and no end of <
excitement in California Hall last night ,
when the voters of the Forty-third Dis
trict met to organic* a Kepubliean cluh.
First, a meeting under J. J. Curry's lead
ership convened and elected officers. Then
a second party, numbering 142 voters, un
der the leadership of Dawson Mayer. J.
<_J. Bovne and Thomas K. Kase came up
from ii hall a few doors below and seated
themselves in the ropm. When the latter i
found that the officers of the club had ;
b.-en elected without consulting them the j
fun began. Ivase arose and challenged |
the election of the officers. He was told
to sit down. He then appealed to the
chair. The appeal was not considered, j
t'urry then moved for an adjournment.;
somebody seconded the motion and those !
who participated in the first meeting left
the hall, leaving the Mayer-Boyne-Kase
iaction in possession.
On motion of Kase the newcomers then
made James D. Hart permanent chair- |
man and Fred Tobiemann secretary and i
proceeded to elct a new set of officers as j
follows: James 1Â». Hart, president; Daw
.^on Mayer, I'.rst vice president; A. G. .'
I'lutt. second vice president: Frank Shibe- \
ley, treasurer; George Reed, sergeant at |
arms. The invading voters declared them
selves to represent the decent element of â¢
the Forty-third and branded Curry as a \
Kelly-Crimmins? man. and recalled his
having run for State Printer on the Dem
ocratic ticket. As a last move Kase,
Borne, Mayer and S. II. Scott were ap
pointed a committee to appear before the !
County Committee to-day and present j
their claims to havir.g their meeting con- I
sidered the proper one and their club the
official club of the district. The following
resolutions were then drafted:
TRICT
Horace Davis. As the ticket of elected
officers stainls the club is composed of Dib-i
i .e boss supporters all through. Charles
A. Murdook was elected first vice presi
dent. William J. Attridge, second vice
president; Louis N. liain, secretary, and
J.I. Brandt, treasurer.
Judge Oibble's success in electing A. b.
Spt-ar president of the club is not signifi
cant. The Forty-first District is anti-boss
in sentiment and when the primary elec
tion is hold anti-boss delegations will be
chosen to represent the people in the nom
inating conventions. Judge Dibble is a
candidate for re-election to the Assembly
FORTY-SECOND ASSEMBLY DIS-
"It was a common saying there." said
he, "that no news could get out of the
imperial city, as It was sealed up as tight
as a tomb. We could only conclude that
there was ground for the deep concern
expressed regarding the situation in the
capital city."
Commander C. S. Sperry, who has been
until recently In command of the gunboat
Concord in Chinese waters, arrived in this
city on the steamer Rio yesterday on his
way to Washington. He stated that he
was detached from his ship just before
the trouble developed in China. When
he left Shanghai, on the 13th of June,
there was great anxiety as to the safety
of the foreigners in Peking.
Commander Sperry Arrives.
With reference to the famine in India
Sir Frank declared, speaking of course
from a British standpoint, that while
there was famine, "the worst in the his
tory of the country," there was no actual
starvation resulting", in death, and that
the authorities were fully able to care for
the sufferers and were doing so.
"The Japanese Government cannot be
blamed for this situation, but the other
powers can be, for while they are dilly
dallying the lives of their citizens and
distinguished officials are in grave peril.
What will occur as a result of this pecu
liar situation remains to be seen.
"We left Shanghai June 13, and at that
time the anxiety as to the situation In
Peking was very great. A dispatch had
been received from the British consulate
stating that the various consulates were
then safe, but that there was no cer
tainty that the regular Imperial troops
would not join the Boxers and take the
city."
Asked as to the strength, military and
otherwise, of the Boxers, Sir Frank re
plied that so far as outsiders were con
cerned nobody knew.
"Strange tales come supposedly from
the imperial city," said he, "'but when we
are told that the Emperor and the Dew
ager Empress are prisoners in their pal
ace, we can appreciate the fact that the
news that goes Â«o the outer world may be
strongly colored by those in control. Of
course humanity is deeply concerned with
the fate of the representatives of the va
rious nations that are at the mercy of the
Chinese, and the great aim is to save
them. This object could have been ac
complished ere this by Japan had it not
been for the suspicions or jealousies of
the powers. .Japan has offered to quell
the disturbance in China and rescue the
foreigners, but the Japs want some as
surance of remuneration for their ser
vices.- It costs a tremendous amount of
money to create and operate an army of
100,000 or even 50,000 troops, and because
she was deprived of the natural rewards
for her victory, after the conquest of
China, Japan is awaiting for assurances
from the powers.
"The news that has been spread broad
cast," said he, "Is not reliable, for the
simple reason that no official information
could get out of the Imperial city and
reach foreigners. That strange capital has
been bo thoroughly sealed up by the au
thorities that no intelligence can escape.
What has occurred witnln its walls will
not be known until such time as those
who are in power ste tit to give the facts
to the world.
Sir Frank Swettenham, Resident Gen
eral of the Federated Malay States,
arrived from China on the steamer
Kio yesterday. The gentleman has spent
many years in the Orient and is con
versant with the conditions that exist In
the Flowery Kingdom. While not inclined
to be talkative, he vouchsafed some ln
tormation that will be found interesting
to the world that is watching tne tragedy
In China.
