WASHINGTON. July 26.â There
were no developments to-day to
warrant the assumption that
there was the slightest Improve
ment in, the Chinese situation.
Indeed, the general tenor of such news as
found light was to add to the steadily
growing doubt as to the good faith of the
Chinese Government, as manifested in its
acts. A letter frcm Admiral Kempff, given
publicity by the Navy Department to
day, made the direct statement that the
Imperial authorities were In sympathy with
the Boxers, though he added thati the
Government was afterward paralyzed and
Incapable of controlling the situation.* This
was the first official declaration to reach
our Government contradictory of the Chi
nese representations that the imperial
Government had steadfastly and from the
first opposed the Boxer movement, and
our Government is bound to accept the
word of its own officer until that is over

Then. the exchanges that are in constant
progress â¢ between the powers are tending
more apd more to cast suspicion upon the

jf "Li- Hung Chang now states that some members of the legations have already left Peking and may be expected
shortly. He is becoming angry at the skepticism of the Consuls.
"The impression is gaining ground here that the Ministers of the powers to whom China has applied for mediation may
still be alive. The representatives of France, Japan, Russia and the United States have visited Li Hung Chang, but the others
still keep aloof.

and supplies are constantly coming in. The Nanking and Wuchang garrisons are being constantly reinforced, and the Viceroys
admit that they cannot much longer withstand the pressure brought to bear by Sheng and Li Hung Chang upon them to join

CHINESE NEWS SUMMARIZED
FROM THE CALL'S DISPATCHES
ACCORDING to Li Hung Chang, some of the foreign envoys have already left Peking on their
way to Tientsin. This and other Chinese assurances of the safety of the legations con
tinue to be regarded with suspicion in Canton and Hongkong, not to speak of Shanghai,
whence one correspondent telegraphs that the proposal to send the Ministers to the coast is
a part of a deep-laid plot to conceal the date of the massacre.
From Hongkong and Shanghai come reports of a spread of the anti-foreign feeling and
of the more or less alarming attitude of the authorities. In Canton, despite many executions,
the rowdy element remains undismayed, and even in the heart of China the feeling is such that,
one correspondent says, if any reasonable fear becomes current of a partition of China being
intended or of personal injury to the Dowager Empress being threatened, the whole of the cen
tral provinces will explode.
Chinese troops which were beaten at Tientsin are massing at Yaungtun, twenty-five
miles from that city, on the railway line to the capital.
Fifteen thousand Japanese have landed at Shanhaikwan, inflicting a severe defeat
upon the Chinese there. With occupation by Russian forces, a few days ago, of Lutai, on the
railroad which connects Shanhaikwan with Taku, the allied forces are thus in possession of
a double base.
Letters received in St. Petersburg and specially cabled to The Call present a vivid
picture of events in Peking up to as late as June 19. ;

LONDON, July 27. â The Hongkong correspondent of the Daily Express wires as follows under yesterday's date:
"An Italian priest has just arrived here from Hensien-Fu, in Southern Hunan, where the Italian Bishop and three priests
have been massacred after revolting torture. This took place on July 4. Six hundred converts were massacred after the women
had been subjected to hideous brutality. Six other priests fled to the hills, where they were probably killed, The priest who
escaped had a perilous journey to Hongkong. He hid in a coffin on board a river boat for seventeen days,"

Minister of Finance. The first Is dated)
June 13 and reads:'
, " "The situation here has reached a
crisis. On -June 13 the German embarsy
had' a man belonging to the anti-Christian
mob arrested* in Legation streets This
caused a great commotion among. the Chi

because the guards are too few to do any

"The second letter, dated June 13, says:

AMERICAN MISSIONARIES
MURDERED IN SHANSI
LONDON', July 26. â Reports are current
that a number of missionaries, American
and English, have been murdered in
Shansi. One of the dispatches from
Shanghai, published here to-day, says:
"The Canadian missionaries who es
caped from Honan had a terrible experi
ence en route here. The natives every
where were hostile. The rabble attacked
the refugees, beat them and tore the
clothes from their barks. The ladies suf
fered cruel indignities."
The dispatch continued: "Canton re
mains comparatively quiet. The natives,
however, are beginning to fear that the
reinforcements arriving at Hongkong in
tend to attack the Bogue forts and occupy
the citv. The military mandarin has
asked the Colonial Secretary at Hong
kong for assurance that Great Britain,
does not intend to take Canton."
A dispatch received here to-day from
Yokohama states that the Japanese di
vision will all be landed at Taku by July
31 and will reach Tientsin August 3. The
Legislature of New South Wales has re
solved to dispatch a military contingent
to join the imperial troops in China.
HONGKONG. July 26.-The signs of
menacinfr activity on the part of a se
cret society known as the "Triads" are
causing alarm. The "Boxers"' are be
lieved to he an offshoot of the "Triads,"
whose ramifications are widespread
throughout the southern provinces of
China. The organization is distinctly
anti-foreign and anti-Manchu, and num
bers of Canton troops are enrolled in its
ranks.
A report is current in Canton that the
"Triads" are preparing for a night attack
on the Chief Shameen, and that the first
Fipn will be the abscondinjf of native ser
vants. The greatest apprehension pre
vails, although at present Canton is quiet.
Many "Triads" have been arrested in
Honpkong during- the last few months. A
Chinaman was arrested on July 8 on a
charpe of being a member of the
"Triads." The evidence showed that he
hnd hr-ld the rank in command in the or
ganization in the two Kwangs. with head
quarters at Saikung. a new territory,
where he had been active in enrolling
mf-mhers. His arrest, therefore, is of the
greatest importance. The insignia found
upon his person includes the highest de
1 grees.
An opium farmer has received a tele
gram asserting that U Hung Chang is
unable to proceed to Peking and will re
turn to Canton, probably calling at Hong-
S kong on the way.

LONDON, July 27.â The Daily Mail publishes this dispatch
from its special correspondent:
'â¢SHANGHAI. July 2G. â The proposal made by the ChinÂ«ss
Government to the American Consul, through Taotai Sheng, that
hostilities ag-ainst the Chinese should ceass upon condition that the
foreign Ministers were sent under escort to Tientsin, appears to
be part of a deep-laid plan to conceal the date of the massacre and
the duplicity of officials who, b-ing in possession of thÂ« news, sup
pressed it. The story will be that the Ministers all left Peking un
der a strong esccrt, but were set upon by a mob of Boxers/ We
shall bs told that, althoug-h thÂ» Chinese soldiers fought bravely,
they were overcome and all were massacred."'
LONDON, July 27. 4:3j a. m.â li.e
Shai.ghai correspondent of the Daily

Ivlukclen, says:
"The Bishop had armed 2^0 eon-

One Life Probably Lost in an At
â¢tempt to Free Swindler Boyd
From Pennsylvania
Penitentiary.
P1TTSBURG. July 28.â A bold and sys
tematic plan for the release of one or
more prisoners from Riverside Peniten
tiary was thwarted to-day by accident.
The first theory advanced setyncd to point
to the release of Alexander Berkman, tuo
anarchist, who is serving a twenty-two
year sentence for the shooting of H. C
i'rick during the big Homestead strike
in 1SS2, but the conclusion reached to
night by Director Muth of the Allegheny
Police Department is that tiie real object
of the rescuers was to secure the freedom
of the notorious real estate swindler, J.
C. Boyd, who is serving a seven-year sen
tence in the penitentiary for his mis
deeds. This opinion is shared by the
Pittsburg police officials also and many
reasons are brought forward to confirm
the theory. Among these are the fact
that Boyd is wanted in nearly every State
in the Union on charges of real estate
swindles, has confederates all over the
country and is accounted one of tho
wealthiest prisoners in Riverside.
The plan by which the rescuers hoped
to reach the inside of the penitentiary
wall was by a tunnel from the cellar of
a house on Sterling street, nearly op
posite one of the gates. Their work id
remarkable considering the obstacles to
be overcome. Investigation to-day showj
that it was over two hundred feet lonj;,
but because of its zigzag character had
not reached the prison wall. One of the
officers who crawled a distance of 201 feet
in the dark passageway to-day was com
pelled to return before reaching its end
by reason of the foul gases arising. From
this it is inferred that the tunnel had
tapped a sewer. Director Muth, however,
believes that the body of one of the tun
nelers will be discovered to-morrow when
the tunnel Is opened from the surface.
He thinks the man was overcome by
gases and that his companions fled.
The elaborate arrangements that had
been made for completing the tunnel and
for providing for the safety of the dip
pers is a source of amazement to the au
thorities. An electric bell, connected with
the entrance of the tunnel in the cellar,
was used in giving the workers and
watchers an instant signal in- case of
alarm, and an air pump had been used to
keep the tunnel free from gas. It is. esti
mated that the electric plant and other
apparatus used cost the would-be liber
ators at Iea3t $2000.
On March 15 last Thomas Brown, who
represented himself as a Chicago solicitor,
purchased from John C. Langritt. who Is
an engineer in the penitentiary, the house
at 28 Sterling street for $4000, paying 5250
down and agreeing to pay the balance in
installments. Soon afterward Brown, a
woman whom he said was his wife and
his brother-in-law moved into the house,
and operations were probably begun at
once. The Misses Letetia and Jennie Mc-
Carthy, who lived just opposite the house,
had their suspicions aroused because of
the small quantity of furniture going into
the supposed home of the Brown family
and by the fact that the principal articla
taken in was a, piano. During the occu
pancy of the house the shades were al
ways down, but the piano was rarely si
lent. Mrs. Brown played and sang almost
constantly. During the interval when
there was no music the Misses McCarthy
heard a. grinding, whirring noise, which
gave them the impression that the
Browns were always grinding coffee.
Their suspicions of crookedness were con
firmed when they saw a load of galvan
ized pipe and a load of lumber taken into
the house. They called the attention of
the police to the place, but no charge
could be made against the occupants.
The Brown3 left the house on the night
of July 5, leaving word for Mr. Langfltt
that they were going to New York, but
would return on July 24 to pay the first
Installment on the house. Their failure
to return led to the investigation by Mr.
Langfltt. _Â¦
The theory is that the Browns were
frightened away, because all of the ap
paratus was found in the house with the
exception of the digging tools, which Di
rector Muth thinks are in the tunnel with
the body of the digger.

RAISE MONEY
TO
OF Â¦San Quentin Officials Deny a Sensa
tional Story and Point Out
Its Absurdity.
SAN RAFAEL, July 26Jr-The sensa
tional story published In one of this morn-
Ing's papers stating that two guards at
San Quentin prison were poisoned by
some vengeful convict Is heartily ridiculed
by the prison authorities.
The Warden, Martin Agulrre. said when
speaking of the published story: "I can
not understand where so wild and ridicu
lous a tale ever originated. There is no
more ground to say or believe that Ihu
two guards are suffering from aconite poi
soning than there Is to say the same thing
of me at this minute."
Dr. Casey, the resident physician at the
prison, when Interviewed <-aid: '"The
story of the poisoning of the guards is
too silly to be commented on. A month fit
so aso the men had been 111 with diph
theria, and what slight illness they now
have Is the after effects of that disease.
A soreness had settled in Arbogast's leg
below the knee, and McNeil has a slight
trouble with his threat. The men were
given a vacation because they needed it.
They will have two weeks of rest."
Arbogast Is at Byron Springs. The wild
tale of a fiendish prisoner manufacturing
aconite from the prison shrubbery finds
no believers. Arbogast and McNeil are
both guards on the wall, and even if all
the prisoners In the yard were manufac
turers of aconite they would have no op
portunity to administer it to these two
guards.

COMING TO SAN DIEGO
Kosmos Line of Steamships "Wil
Bring tha Mineral Rock,
Which. Is to Be Treated
at Pueblo.
Special Dlsj>aVh to The Call.
SAX DIEGO, July 26.â The steamers ol
the Kosmos line, which have been call
ing here for the past eight months most
of the time with small consignments of
freight will hereafter come well loaded
with freight for this port. The unprece
dented activity in business circles
throughout the East Is In part responsi
ble for the increase In the amount of
freight to be handled this way.
For years Eastern smelters have been
treating gold ore from the west coast of
South America, â¢which has found its way
to them across the Isthnyi3 of Panama.
The smelters are so srowded with busi
ness that they do not undertake to make
returns on ore In the time desired by
mine owners and the direction of the
shipments has therefore been changed.
The ore will come to the amount of from
500 to KiOO tons per month through this
port to be forwarded immediately to Pu
eblo, Colo. The first shipment is expected
by the Tanls, which should reach here
about the middle of next month, though
It is possible that It will not arrive until
September, when the Herodot Is due to
arrive. The Tanls is bringing about 150
tons of nitre, the first to come througn
this port, for Los Angeles from Chile.
Captains and pursers of the liners who
have been here within the past few
months have said that the business down
the coast was large, but that it was slow
work changing the conditions. They have
all agreed that it was only a matter of
time when a large portion of that trade
-would be diverted to California points.

"they say there will be a surprise, and a
big one. before the case Is ended, which
will close with the Bradys receiving a
term in San CJuentin for something else
beside the wholesale pilfering of barley.
Another part of the story comes from
Vancouver, B. C. Some time ago Con
stable Coleman of this place received a
letter frcm a man in Vancouver, asking
If two men by the name of Brady were
living in this neighborhood. The letter
gave an accurate description of the two
men now under arrest, together with that
of the woman who now claims to be the
elder Brady's wife and the three children.
The writer stated that he desired to know
because the elder Brady had been a source
of annoyance ar.d trouble to him for the
past ten years, having run away with his
sister-in-law, who was a married woman,
and he wished toTteep informed as to the
location of the brothers. Further, fie
stated that the Bradys were hard cases,
much given to driving around the country,
stopping at farmhouses during the ab
sence of the occupants and carrying off
whatever movables they could escape
wiih. The writer further asked if the
Bradys were wanted here for any crime,
as he knew they had hurriedly left Cali
fornia-last fall for the north, and suspect
ed them of having had to fly to avoid ar
rest.
The local officers knew nothing of eith
er Brady, had never heard of them before
and Constable Coleman did not answer
the letter.
Now it is known that the Bradvs work
ed in this neighborhood for a few days
last summer and they are suspected of
having nlied their srrain thieving trade
iher>. The wife of Brady the elder Is
thought by the officers to be the wife
of an Arizona cattleman, having run away
with Brady while the latter was In tha't
country. To this the letter from the Van
couver man gives a coloring of unques
tionable truth. There is hardly any doubt*
but that E. W. Brady "did time" In Texas
for counterfeiting, and the officers may,
as they now think, have- captured a pair
of thorough crooks who may be wanted
elsewhere for something far more serious
than the I-odf charge.

f rec\&\ Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA ROSA. July 26.â Early this aft
erncon a report was in circulation that J.
E. King, who on Sunday killed S. H.
Church in Two Rock Valley, had been
captured anff* placed in custody. The re
port reached this city from Petaiuma,
where it had torn brought by a rancher
living In the Two Rock district. Investi
gation, howev-r, soon showed the report
to have been erroneous.
Xo inkling a? to the man's whereabouts
has y<^t P<H?n discovered. He has not been
seen" by any one. as far a? can be learned,
since the moment he alighted from the
buggy in which he and his wife started
for Santa Ro?a on Sunday afternoon, at
a point just opposite the creamery, and
said he would walk on afoot and give
himself up to Sheriff drnce.
Sheriffs Grace and Taylor have net yet
given up hopps. however, and seem confi
dent that their man will soon be run to
earth. A number of interesting theories
have been advanced as to which direction
King- took after leaving the gum tree
grove. Most of the theorist? are of the
opinion that King stayed In the grove all
day and left at night. Concealment in the
grove would not be a difficult matter, as
it Is some ft-ven acres in extent and a
large proport-ion of it is sapling growth.
If once detected or uncovered, however,
the murderer wculd have a poor chance
nf getting away, as it would be hard to
move quietly frcm plrce to plaoc among
the trees. The dry gum twigs and bark
would prevent n noiseless passage.
King must have got to the coast section.
where there arc many small shippirg
points. Bark and wood are now being
pent out in large quantities from these
points, and It would be possible for King
to smuggle himself aboard at night w'ith
the connivance of the captain and so
reach San Francisco. It was by somewhat
similar mean? that Bruggy, the murderer,
was supposed to have made his esrape
from the county after gaining his liberty
by breaking jail several years ago.

Epedal Dispatch to The Call,
VANCOUVER, B. C. July 26.â The fish
ermen's strike at Steyeston seems to be
drawing near an end. I This morning the
Indians deserted the whites and went out
to flsh.
I-rast night at Steveston the white fisher
men leaders had difficulty, in keeping the
Indians from attacking the Japanese in a
body. This morning the renewed run of
heavy fish was too much of a temptation
for the natives and they went out and
began to make ready for commencing
work. They wanted either to fight or else
go to work, and when the whites would
not allow them to do the former they in
turn became indignant and resolved to
make what money they could while the
season__yet lasted.
From the manner of the Indians itÂ»wos
apparent that they were excited proba
bly through fear that the whites would
molest them, but as the morning dawned
and no trouble came, they became more
at ease. At 6 o'clock ten boats manned by
Indians stole silently away from the Pa
clnc Coast cannery. The tug Reliance,
with six ppt-cial policemen aboard, went
down the river to be on hand- in case any
violence should be attempted. At noon
the canneries on the main river were
alive with Siwashes and Klootchmen, all
busily engaged in overhauling boats, nets,
sails* etc.
The condition of affairs from three
points of view is given as follows:
Lieutenant Colonel Worsnopâ One of
two things will happen. Kither matters
will drift along for a week and part of
the men will return to work while the
others disband, or else there will be a
fight. If one blow Is struck there will be
a serious affray.
C. S. Windsor (largest cannery owner)â
We are perfectly willing to recognize the
Fishermen's Union, whose officials are
bona-fide fishermen, and to treat with
them, but we have nothing to say to the
professional agitator. I think the staike
will ultimately prove the best thing that
ever happened for the industry.
Vice IÂ»resÂ»dent Rogers of the Fisher
men's Unionâ We have had great difficulty
in restraming the Indians from an opet.
outbreak. They are very restless and
want by force to drive the Japanese off
the river and out of the country. We win
work for 23 cents a flsh. or nothing.

SACRAMENTO, July 28.â The State
Code Commission appointed in July, 1SDU.
to-day turned over to State Printer Johns
ton the final batch of matter comprising
its report to the legislature on the re
vision of the Code of Civil Procedure.
The commissioners In their report ob
serve that the Civil Code, following- the
plan of the old practice act, contains
many sections reiterating, or at least in
tended to reiterate, provisions in the Stats
constitution^ This, the commissioners re
mark, is clearly unnecessary, for a con
stitutional provision derives no additional
force, nor }s it made less difficult of in
terpretation by legislative affirmance or
re-expression, and it has more than once
happened that a legislative re-expression
has. by departing from the precise phrase
ology of the constitution, led to doubt and
litigation resulting- in the courts being
called upon to apply and enforce the con
stitution itself in preference to the decla
ration of the code.
Among- the more Important of the
amendments proposed by the commission
are the following:
Denying the right to prosecute actions by
parties who have no interest in the subject
Removing: the disability of married women
to sue or be sued alone when they are the real
parties in interest
Taking from County Clerks all quasi-Judicial
authority, as for Instance hearing and deter
mining exceptions to the sufficiency of sure
ties and contlningr the performance of ?uch du
ties to Judges, Court Commissioners and other
Judicial officers.

ship 10 an officer of a corporation trho is a
party to the j eutt requiring corporations,
whether de jure or <3e facto, to be made parties
to iroceedings to forfeit franchises exercised
by them.
The commissioners also recommend
changes in the present code so as to make
letter-press copybooks admissible In evi
dence; so there may be but one contest
of a will; so that non-resident heirs may
be restored their right to nominate ad
ministrators, and so that the filing of an
Inventory may be excused when the will

FINED FOR VIOLATION
OF THE CUSTOMS LAWS
Late this afternoon Mayor Capdeville
Issued a proclamation, which had an ex
cellent effect. It called upon all citizens
not enrolled In the special police to go to
their homes and places of business and re
main there. They were warned also and
advised not to assemble or idle about the
streets. The police were ordered to dis
perse all crowds and to arrest all ob
streperous and disorderly Â¦ persons. As a
result of the proclamation tp-nig-ht few
pepple were found on the streets. In or
der to prevent the miscellaneous distribu
tion of arms the Mayor ordered the clos
ing up of gun stores and early in the day
Issued orders to the police to close up
every saloon in the city.
The Sheriff assured both of them that
he had the Jail bo well protected that it
would require the use of dynamite to
reach the culprit.
Jails Guarded.
At 2 o'clock an unknown white man
coming along Julia street, near Baronese,
saw a negro and without any provoca
tion began to fire at him. The negro
escaped, it Is believed, without being hit
Sheriff Klock in charge of the Parish
Prison, saw both the Mayor and the Chief
of Police to-day. There Is confined in the
prison Leonard Pierson, who was the man
with Charles when the latter shot and
dangerously wounded Patrolman Mora
before he killed Captain Day and Patrol
man Lamb. The mobs that have been
going the rounds of the city have been
anxious to get Pierson if possible and
lynch him.
One of the most sensational incidents of
the day waa the discovery' of two negroes
wounded almost to death in a boxcar on
the levee front, near the corner of Jo
sephine street. The poor fellows were
desperately hurt and only one was con
scious. He was so frightened that he de
clined to give any account of the shooting
Both were removed to the Charity Hos
pital, where It was found that both had
been stabbed close to the heart. One
was Nathan Brown and the other Charles
Washington.
An hour afterward a white man saw a
negro named Ross at the corner of La
fayette and Dryad streets and fired his
gun at him. Those on the street fled in
every direction and the negro made his
escape. Shortly after 1 o'clock Josephine
Wild, a child, while seated in front of her
home, caught a stray bullet In the face.
Two hours later Nordo Fratallo and Tony
Michel, Italians, got into a dispute as to
whether the mob was right or wrong in
running down and whipping the negroes.
One had a knife and the other a gun
Fratallo was badly wounded.
Bullets Fly Wild.
the remnants of one of the mobs gathered
at the Spanish Fort Railway, where a
large number of negro laborers dally
leave for their work at Chalmette. They
saw a crowd of darkles approaching and
started to chase them. Louis Lapuyard
got .in their way and received a bullet In
the leg. Later in the forenoon a negro
emptied his pistol Into a downtown house
and wounded a child. At 11 o'clock a mob
marched through Lafayette Square, which
is opposite the City Hall, and discovering
some negroes in the park jumped on and
beat them until they made their escape.

he would order out all available troops.
First Brigade Responds.
Without delay he sent messages to Col
onel HoRdon. commanding the First Bri
gade, and had him immediately order out
the Washington Artillery, the Louisiana
Field Artillery and the First Regiment.
At twilight there were 1500 men in the
armories. At the same time the Mayor,
in a proclamation, applied for 500 special
police. Before 4 o'clock p. m. 400 repre
sentative citizens had been sworn In. The
Mayor drew upon the leading hardware
and ammunition establishments of the
city and the specials were heavily armed
and then distributed over the clty c
Hoodlums prowled the streets through
out the day and whenever they spied a
negro assaulted him. In some cases citi
zens rallied the police and with their as
sistance beat off the hoodlums. One of
the most flagrant instances of cowardice
shown was that of a man who slipped into
the Morgue and, pointing his pistol
through a window, made an attempt to
shoot one of the female negro prisoners
In the parish prison. Just before daylight
NEW ORLEANS. July 26.â In the
rioting of hust night and to-day
one negro was beaten to death, six
were so badly Injured that their
lives are despaired of and about a
score of people, white and black, male
and female, have been more or less seri
ously hurt. Disorderly acts following the
disturbances of hist night were committed
throughout the city to-day and resulted
in the swearing In by the Mayor of 500
special policemen and the ordering out of
1500 of the State militia upon orders of
Governor Heard, who responded promptly
to the appeal of Mayor Capdeville for as
sistance in suppressing the existing law
lessness and in preventing to-night a re
currence of the violence of last night.
Throughout the day attacks have been
mude by Irresponsible mobs of whites
upen the black element, and the negroes
before nightfall had been completely
chased from the streets. The effect of thÂ«
disorders has put a practical stop to busi
ness in the wholesale districts and the
river front, and this means a serious
crippling of the trade of the port. The
business elements are allied in force and
hundreds of the most prominent men of the
city responded to the appeal of the Mayor
for assistance in preserving order.
Colonel Wood, who commanded the
First Louisiana Regiment in the Spanish
war, was placed in command of the spe
cial police.
Police Helpless.
The police have been practically help
less throughout the disturbance. The
force consists of three hundred men, in
cluding clerks and operators, and this is
manifestly a force inadequate to the pres
ervation of the peace in a city of 310,000
people. But aside from this was the in
dignation among the members of the de
partment over the killing of Captain Day
and Patrolman Lamb by the negro Robert
Charles.
Further, there is a strong resentment
on the part of the working people against
steamship agents and contractors because
of the employment of negro labor to the
exclusion of whites on public works and
on the levee fronts.,
Mayor Capdeville was at Ocean Springs
last night when the mobs swept ovex the
city, but when he arrived at his office to
day he came with the full determination
to take hold of the situation with a firm
hand. Pie found awaiting him a delega
tion of the leading merchants of the city,
who said the interests of the community
and Its commercial welfare demanded
prompt and vigorous action. At the same
time, IJeutenant Governor Estopenal,
who had witnessed a scene of outrages
upon negroes on Canal street, Joined the
conference at the hotel. He at once ad
vised a conference with Governor Heard

A question in regard to the allegations
that the Catholic missionaries were

foreigners in China brought from the Car
dinal an emphatic denial. There were he
said, about half a million native Catho
lics in China. While the Catholic prelates
had been granted some judicial authority
bv the Emperor and mandarins, this was
because by far the greater number of
Christians in China were Catholics ana it
had been found helpful to both the church

others some Judicial authority.

Cardinal Gibbons, to have a deteriorat

Commissioner Hermann Makes a
Ruling in AccoTd With Judge
Ross' Decision.
WASHINGTON'. July 26.â Commissioner
Hermann of the General Land Office has
decided to continue for a reasonable time
the suspension of about fifty whole town
ships in 1a>9 Angeles, San Francisco and
Vlsalla land districts in California from
disposition under the agricultural laws on
representations that they contain valu
able oil deposits. A thorough inquiry into
the true character of the lands now is in
progress. Petitions and sworn protests
have been filed with the General Land Of
fice setting 1 out that vast areas of non
agricultural lands In California have every
Indication of containing valuable deposits
of oil. The land office last February or
dered the suspension of these townships
In view of the controversy over their
value as oil lands.
The action Is In line with a recent deci
sion of Judge Ross of the United States
Circuit Court for the Southern District of
California affirming the right of forest lieu
selection scrlpholders to tllo on land nor
legally known to be mineral, regardless of
placer mining locations. This was a test
case, one of the many similar cases pend
ing where forest lieu selection was made
on land alleged, to be oil land and there

ing laws exclusively.

in a most remarkable state of preserva

at the ankle as clean as a blow from a
guillotine might and. being swallowed
whole, it had remained with only a few
scratches. The condition of the other
bones showed that when the unfortunate
young man's body was at the mercy of
the waves a number of sharks had at
tacked it at once and they had fought
over It. rending it Mrnb from limb. By
the shark that has been caught the foot
had been swallowed whole, but the other

ORDER ISSUED
FOR ARREST OF
E. G. RATHBONE
PAJCAMA. July 26. â A treaty of penco between the Government nnd the rev
olutlnrtsTs was rigne.1 this afternoon. This action followed directly after
the most desperate battle of the entire revolution, in which the losses on
,;..-)-. Fide wore very hoavy. Under forms of the treaty the surrender of
the 'insurgents is complete. Th<Â»y agree to deliver up all the arms, nm
munitinn and ships in their possession. Owing, it is believed, to some misun
der^tandir.g of xho terms of the armistice brought about yesterday by the Ameri
can. Kiffiifh and French Consuls, tlie insurants suddenly renewed thc-ir at
tackr upon the suburb? of Panama about 7 o'clock last night. The fighting lasted
eleven hour*, with the exception of only a few minutes' Interval. a:id was 1 very
heavy from start to finish. Th<Â» rebol troops made charge a/ter cViargo upon
the trenches of the Government forces, pushing forward with remarkable
bravery and with a recklessness approaching clnpoly to madness. Every assault
rn-ns rppulpod with tÂ« rrible loss of life, but thÂ« rebel? wore undaunted and with
extraordinary courage and renewed vigor repented thÂ« attack? aeraln and again.
These desperate nssiults were kept tip all night long and were met with equally
brave rep!=tarre by the regulars. In one of the lntrc-nchmonts defended by a
detnohrr.ent composed almost entirely of young men from this city, nearly every
one of the defenders was killed or badly woj:ndcd.
It was 6 n clock this morning when thr> revolutionist? wore finally compelled
To plvÂ»Â» tip their attacks and forced to retreat to the positions they held when
the armistice was declared. The tide of battle was turned against them by the
arrival en an express train from Colon of right hundred fresh troops to rein
force the Oovernm^nt. These gave the regulars an advantage and the rebels
retired after eleven hours of such fierce fighting as the isthmus nf>ver saw be
fore. ThfÂ» appearance of the battleground after thp cessation of hostilities can
b e better imnelnert than described. Dead and dying men were lying all along the
Caledonia road beyond the railroad bridge for a half mile, sometimes scattered
a few feet apart and more often in heaps, packed closely together.
How many were killed during the night fs not yet known, hut the number will
reach Into the hundreds. The exact loss may never be, known, for many of the
wounded men crawled out of the way Into thickets and those who died in the
bushes may not all be found, being recorded simply as "missing."

Dawson news of July 13 says the fact
is becoming more apparent with the rc

creeks of the district that while the out
put in the aggregate was Inrger than last
year's by nearly 75 per cent, the actual
cost of production was so much greater
that few mine owners find a balance on
the credit fide of their ledgers and a
large majority of lay men find themselves
utterly ruined, while the wages of hun

the outcome of the winter's futile toil.
The cause of it lies in the bad laws, ex
cessive taxation and the defective lay sys

the rankest kinds of wildcat speculation

largely of poor worklngmen.

gathered at the parlors as mourners over
the fragmentary remains.
The shark was a monster, weighing over
"00 pounds, and nearly fourteen feet long.
Its Jaws, when distended, might have
taken in a man's body whole. As the jaws
are now, taken from the body and held
apart, a man might pass through them
as through .a hoop and never touch the
sides. Long rows of sharp teeth show the
giant fish's terrible power as a destroyer.
Thg man who captured the monster had
a fearful tussle before landing his prize.
He is John Keneplkl, a South Sea Island
er, who makes his living by fishing. The
big shark had been seen about the en
trance to the harbor and John started
out at night to catch it. Just before mid
night the monster seized his hook and for
over an hour and a half John waged bat
tle with the shark. His small boat was
dragged to and fro with lightning rapidity
by the monster below, but John never
gave up the fight and he finally tired the
shark out and landed It upon the beach.
When morning came he cut it open and
made the ghastly discovery of human
bones.

731 Market St., San Francisco.At a rneeUng- "Wednesday night of the
Improved Order of Red Men. at which
Â¦were present representatives cf the va
rious local tribes, it â¢was decided to accept
the invitation of Grand Marshal Costeiio
and enter the parade of September 10.
There are two organizations of men who
belonged to the Volunteer Fire Depart
ment of San Francisco. One is the Ex
empt Firemen, vhos? house Is on the hill
at Ihe head of Portsmouth Square, and
the other is the Veteran Volunteer Fire
nien's Association, with headquarters on
Fourth street. It wa* thought by the
parade committee that these two organf
ictiens v.-ould form one division of the
f.rcrntn cf the old days and that to these
Â«ro"ul<J be added the Sons of Exempts, who
are to lÂ«e successors of the exempts and
the veterans of the paid l'ire Department.
V\zt it was found that the o'ji men on the
bill ar.d the Fourth-street contingent
would not assimilate, even for one day.
&nd it has been decided that there shall
be two divisions. The Exempts. Sons of
Exempts and the paid veterans will be in
one division and the Veteran Volunteers
in another division. It is probable that
this will be the Jast time the Kxempts
will parade as an association, as the or
ganization has dwindled down from 12W.
when the paid Fire Department went into
operation; to 77.
The Volunteer Veterans have Invited
fire organizations in Bister cities to parade
with tr.< tn. They will turn out the engine
called the Veteran, and one which was at
one time the property of Knickerbocker

have in line fM men. with the Golden Gate
military band of twenty-five piect-s, Rin
ccn Parlor drum corps of twenty mem
bers and an eiecant Coat representing the
seal of the State of California, drawn by
six horses. It will also have a new plush
banner costing HjO. which will be paraded
for the finÂ«t time, mounted on a handsome
polished oak banner carrier, with nickel
trimmir.gs and the latest improved sulky
wheels.
Sunset Parlor No. 2G of Sacramento will
establish its headquarters at the Lick
House banquet hall in San Francisco, on
the walls of which are magnificent paint
ings of California scenery and pioneer
scenes, making it a most suitable head
quarter?. The hall will be open from Fri
day, September 7. to and including Tues
day. September 11. and during that time
all will be welcome.
Adjutant General Seaman has advised
the grand marshal In reply to a question
that vhere are no available funds under
the control of the officers of the Xational
Guard to pay for the transportation of
troops to San Francisco to take part' in

Now the coming of the Valley road has
worked a mighty change in the situation,
and the long-suffering people of the city
of flourmills and wheat are being given a
service that fills them : with satisfaction,
while at the -same time it is causing a
vast amount of discomfort in the yellow
building, corner of Montgomery and Mar
ket streets. The trouble arises out of the
fact that the new line is giving a first
c'.ass service for a second-class price. In
other words, the Valley road has not
deemed it advisable to put on cars such
as the Southern Pacific Company provides
for Stockton and Sacramento people.
It Is a natural consequence that the
public evince a great preference for the
new service, wherefor there is a probabil
ltv that there will be some red hot com
petition for the Stockton travel.' By rea
son of the present unusual situation the
Southern Pacific is now seriously consid
ering a plan to run a fast Stockton train
that will : be â¢ thoroughly competitive and
up to date in every respect. There is
some hesitation, owing to the Increased
expense, but it is understood that If the
Santa Fe service continues as at present
their big competitor will make a strong
bid for the coveted patronage. The pro
gress of the fight will be watched with
interest.: ...... . . Â¦ . - "
Since the opening of the Valley road to
Point Richmond greatly Improved service
has been given the traveling public. The
residents of Bakersfield and those tribu
tary to that thriving city have for years,
in unison with people of intermediate
points, prayed for and finally demanded
a sleeping-car service between their city
and San Francisco. Notwithstanding the
travel was at times heavy enough to fill
an entire car, the old line would not recog
nize the merits of the demand on the
ground that the traffic did not warrant
the innovation. The Santa Fe people did
not take such a view of the situation,
and tbe result -was that the sleeping-car
service was inaugurated to the extreme
satisfaction of the people of the southern
end of the San Joaquin Valley and the
discomfiture of the Southern Pacific Com
pany.
There is a* heavy travel between this
city and Stockton, which requires the fa
cilities of railroads and steamboat lines
to accommodate it. Since the days that
Collis P. Huntington threatened to "make
grass grow in the streets of Stockton,"
the people of that sturdy, thriving city
have received no consideration from the
old railroad company. Slow trains and
miserable rolling stock have been charac
teristic of the service, and the public
could only swear and pay. for transporta
tion, as there was no competitor save the
steamboats. *
The Valley road Is doing all kinds of
good business these days and at the same
time earning the gratitude of the people
of the San Joaquin Valley, who are re
ceiving the benefits of competition. The
freight service is given greater attention
and there is much more effort to provide
prompt delivery of groods. both local and
transcontinental. llie business of the
Santa Fe system is developing splendidly,
and by reason of the introduction of East
ern railroad methods of obtaining and
handling traffic they are finally awaken
ing the Southern Pacific Company to a
realization of the fact that there is such
a thing as actual competition in this field.

Judge Jeremiah F. Sullivan, attorney
for Mrs. Murray, yesterday appeared in

name of his client, that an Inquest be
held to determine the cause of Mrs.

granted, and Chief Deputy McCormick
summoned a Jury, Â¦which will this after

case are as follows:
Mrs. Ella F. Murray, daughter of the
late Mrs. Alraira S. Townsend, has en
tirely changed her course of action in the
matter pertaining to her mother's sud
den death on last Sunday morning. In
stead of continuing to keep the last mo
ments of her parent shrouded in mystery
she yesterday demanded a full and pub
lic investigation.

Attcnity Pippy says that the identity of
the person who saw the alleged will and
who has knowledge of its probable hid
ing place will never be known. He has
given his promise not to divulge the per
son's name. When he shall appear in
c&urt ar.d apply for an order to search for
the will it will be upon information fur
nished by this mysterious person, yet to
bo given him.
Judge Bahrs yesterday issued an order
of court appointing Samuel M. Shortridge
and George H. Pippy attorneys for the
absent heirs of the estate of Mrs. A. S.
Townsend. Information placed before
these lawyers convinces them that Mrs.
Townsend made a will which is in exist
ence and may be produced in sp*te of all
effort to conceal or destroy it. Knowledge
in this regard was derived from one who
was very exose to Mrs. Townser.d and one
in whom Ehe had implicit confidence. Miss
Rattigan is not the one referred to as the
possessor of the secret, as the relations
which she sustained toward Mrs. Town
send did not call for unreserved con
fidence in regard to all business affairs.
So confident are the attorneys that a
will exists that an application may be
made to the Superior Court to-day for an
order authorizing a thorough search of
the California-street premises to the end
of bringing forth the document. Ample
testimony can te produced to prove that
a will was drawn for Mrs. Towr.send by a
well-known local lawyer. " It may not be
necessary to call the lawyer who drew
the will "as a witness, because the attor
neys for the absent heirs believe that a
diligent search on lines revealed to them,

graphic reply:
TALLAC. Cal., July 25
Editor The Call: I decline to make any
statement until my return to rlty on Monday
DR. MeCOXE.
The body had not been moved before
Deputy Coroner Brown's arrival and Dr.
Heintz had sent for an undertaker. Be
fore any one was permitted to touch th^
body Mr?. Murray wished the Deputv
Coroner to see if Mrs. Townsend haÂ«l anV
keys on her person when she died. None
were found. Deputy Coroner Brown ha*I
the body placed on a board, where it re
mained undisturbed until Dr. Leland can:e
to make the autopsy. The box of mor
phine pills was taken to the Morgue Sun
day afternoon and has been there ever
since. There is no inscription on the box
to tell where It was purchased or who
prescribed the drug-. There are indica
tions that there was formerly writing on
the box that has been scratched or torn
off, but nothing to indicate whether thÂ»
erasure was recentlv made.
Deputy Coroner Brown v'sited Mrs.
Townser.a's home at 4 o'clock Sunday
morning. At that time Mrs. Townsend
had been dead about two hours and a
half. The body was lying, face downward,
on the floor of the bathroom. Brown
noticed that the lips of the dead woman
were discolored. Dr. Heintz, who was
there, said that this â¢was probably due to
her fail. Mrs. Towr.send was apparently
going toward the door of her bedroom
when she fell. In the bathroom, were a
washstand and a bathtub, at the foot of
the latter being a medicine chest. On
the washstand were several bottles of
medicine. The box that contained the
morphine pills Â¦was on the washstand,
some inches from the medicine bottles
and by itself. It was still in that posi
tion when Deputy Coroner, Brown viewed
it. It had been taken up and opened pre
viously by Dr. Sartori. who had examined
the contents. The box was a small paste
board affair, about an inch and a half in
diameter, of white material, having a
gl't streak around it. In the box were
something like a dozen pull Miss Rat
tigan. who was present when Deputy
Coroner Brown arrived, told him that, to
her personal knowledge, the pill box had
been for two years upon the bureau of
Mrs. Townsend in her bedroom, which ad
joined the bathroom, and that it was a
souvenir of some friend of Mrs. Town
send who had died years ago from mor
phine poisoning.
What the Coroner Found
"The taking away of the stomach for
analysis," gai.l Dr. Leland. "did not sig
nify that I thought there was anything
suspicious about the case. I visited the
home of the dead woman on Sunday. At
first I carried away only the contents of
the stomach for chemical analysis, but
reflecting upon the publicity the case
would be sure to have, I thought it would
be better to take the stomach to the chem
ist. The idea that Mrs. Townsend could
have died from morphine poisoning is ri
diculous. Morphine is slow of action and
death would not have occurred within
many hov.rs. The usual time is from two
to twenty-six h&urs, and some authorities
put it fr6m four to twenty-six hours. Had
Mrs. Townsend taken morphine it would
have been reasonable to suppose that she
would have sought her bed when she felt
the narcotic influence stealing over her.
The box of pills was found on the wash
stand in the bathroom, where Mrs.
Townsend died. The box was taken, with
its contents, to Chemist Morgan yester
day, who pronounced the pills to be gela
tine coated morphine pills. Before I
made the autopsy I examined the body
for marks of violence, but found none. 1 '
'"Undoubtedly," said the doctor, "Mrs.
Townsend had a severe attack and sent
out to get morphine to alleviate the pain.
There was no concealment made con
cerning the morphine pills which were in
the room where the dead philanthropist
lay. Miss Rattigan pointed them out to
me and talked calmly and freely about
i hem. I am confident from the history of
the case," said the doctor in conclusion,
"that Mrs. Townsend died from heart dis
ease."
Dr. L-eland, who made the autopsy for
the Coroner's office, says he found noth
ing to indicate that death came from any
other than natural causes. He found the
heart much enlarged and after his exam
ination of the body he concluded that
death was the result of natural causes.
certainly not to morphine poisoning-. The
doctor argues that had Mrs. Townsend
been poisoned with morphine pills self
adminlstered she would not have been
likely to ask, as she did, that Miss Rat
tigan summon a doctor and ask that he
bring morphine with him.

Weekly Call, .81 per YearThe anti-imperialists who are talking of nominating
a "third ticket" are away behind on the count. There
are already ten in the field by the last tally.- ; .
It may be all right with bench and bar, but matters
begin to look as if some lawyers and some Judges
were afraid Chretien might confess too much. *
One of the duties of the Republican party in this
city is to prevent the railroad and the bosses from
controlling the Legislature and gerrymandering the
electoral districts for the next ten years.
v The Grand Jury is doing all right 'on the probate
frauds, but all the same it must not lose sight of
Chinatown. There are a good many violations of
law in that quarter that are decidedly unhealthy for
the community and should Ije made more so for the
perpetrators.
If there is any judicial matter which should be con
ducted economically and concluded promptly it is the
settlement of estates by probate. A family, inexpe
rienced in business, h usually left behind by a dead
man. Its estate is tied up. If productive its profits
decrease, debts accumulate, fees pile up, costs multi
ply, and by the time distribution arrives there is little
or nothing to distribute, as many widows and orphans
have found to their sorrow. The system is an abuse
and should be reformed.
Collateral heirs with shady rights, if^any, are en
couraged to fight wills, and by every possible process
the distribution of estates is delayed, while they are
depleted by every means that the court will permit.
If a list of probated estates and the cost of the
operation could be made, it would be a startling
showing.
AGAIN we insist that the attention roused by the
Chretien case should not lapse until certain
non-criminal abuses in the probate courts are
corrected. It will be noticed that the costs called
legitimate in settling the Sullivan estate amounted to
nearly 50 per cent of the value of the estate. The
same extravagance runs in the settlement of estates
as a common thing in all our courts. It adds a new
terror to a prudent man's deathbed. Men .with large
holdings are being criticized for incorporating their
estates. It is merely a step showing ordinary pru
dencd and is done avowedly in fear of the costs of
going through the probate courts.

Â° officially announced his nomination on July 6, at 8:45 p. m., standard
time, which is eighteen minutes faster than local time at that place. The local or
real time on which this horoscope is based Is, therefore, 8:28 p. m., July 5, 1900.
The Ascendant is in Aquarius, the day sign of Saturn, and that planet Is there
fore the lord of the horoscope and the slgnlflcator of the nominee. Saturn is the
Â¦worst possible planet to rule in any matter, as he always stands for malignance
and misfortune, and he is wholly the signiflcator .of defeat, disgrace or ruin. Tha
mldheaven is in Scorpio, the night sign of Mars, and Mars is therefore the lord of
the tenth house (the house of secular dignities) and the signiflcator of the office
in question. Mars, next to Saturn, is the worst ruler and the most unfortunate
signiflcator in the planetary system. Saturn, the main slgnlficator. is retrograde,
and Mars, the second significator, is angular in the fourth house, which is in mun
dane opposition to the tenth house, of which he is the ruler. The moon, coslgnlfl
cator of the nominee, Is Cadent in Libraâ the fall of Mars and the detriment of
the sun. The sun, cosigniflcator of the office, is Cadent in the sixth house, in the
eign of Cancer, which is the fall of Mars and the detriment of Saturn.
It would require an exceedingly good array of the clearest evidences and of
the strongest arguments to balance and offset these fundamental, weighty and
absolutely adverse testimonies. To overcome them, changing this plain and
6trong sextet of negations into an affirmation, would be simply impossible.
The good location of Jupiter in the tenth house is more than offset by his be
ing retrograde; and Uranus retrograde in the same sign and house confirms this
m ThaTinany of the masses will support him is shown by the orbltular sextllo â¢
of Saturn and the moon; but the moon and Venus are both Cadent, in mutual re
ception and Venus retrograde All this much weakens the argument, which, when
considered with the last above mentioned combination, renders the whole of lit
tle encouragement for his success.

WILY LI HUNG CHANG
The*State issues of the time may be small in com
parison with those involved in the national contest,
but they are important to California, and should be
as carefully considered as are the great questions of
protection and sound money.
The only way to make sure of honest politics, to
bring about the election of worthy Judges and of
loyal Republican legislators, is to fight the bosses in
the district clubs, fight them in the primaries and fight
them in the county convention- should they succeed
in getting any power there. Every business man,
every professional man, every workingman â all the
forces that sustain genuine Republicanism Bhould
enter upon the campaign_at once. Every voter of that
character should register, enroll in his district club
and take an active part in the selection of delegates to
the convention.
The Business Men's Republican Club has demanded
good nominations for Superior Judges and for the
Legislature, and has - accompanied the demand with
the express promise that if worthy men be nominated
the club will support them. That implies that if un
worthy men be nominated the club will not support
them. The warning will not have much effect upon
the bosses. They will nominate their tools if they get
a chance, and then the business men will be in the
dilemma of having to choose between two evils.
They will have to resort to the old process of letting
Democrats have a triumph for the sake of rebuking
Republican bosses. Such rebukes are not so severe
to the bosses as the business men think, and in this
emergency it will not be severe at all, for the Demo
cratic bosses are as close to the railroad as are Crim
mins and Kelly themselves, and a victory of one set
would not be very different from a victory of the
other. )
The only power that can effectually guard against
the combined bosses at this juncture is the Republican
party. That fact is well understood by the bosses
themselves, and accordingly the schemes of the astute
politicians of the railroad are designed to get control
of the Republican conventions, so as to be able to
put up candidates who in the Legislature will obey
railroad dictation. To accomplish that all the bosses
in this city have been combined, and whatever may be
the condition of affairs in other counties, it is certain
that in San Francisco the gangs of barroom bummers
and loafers that are back of Crimmins and Kelly can
be beaten only by the earnest efforts of the better
elements of the party. If there be any indifference to
the legislative or county tickets the bosses will have
a triumph that will endanger the national tickets also.
ALONG with the keen interest which every con
servative citizen must take in the contest
against Bryanism in national affairs there
should go an equal interest in the affairs of the city
and the State. The Call has repeatedly pointed out
that the Legislature which assembles this winter will
be charged with the duty of fixing the Assembly,
Senatorial and Congressional districts, and that the
Senators to be elected this year will hold over and
thus have a vote for the election of a United States
Senator. We have in this election, therefore, to
guard against the danger that the railroad managers
and the bosses may get control of the Legislature and
arrange the electoral districts to suit themselves, and
thus gain an immense advantage in all elections for
ten years to come.
ST0TE ISSUES AT ,STf!r\E.
Revenge is sweet. Local hackmen, the knights of
stiff prices and big fees, are protesting against a mu
nicipal tax which has been levied upon them* . .
Our flour trade with China, it is said, has been ut
terly destroyed by the existing troubles. The ob
jectors should remember, however, that the door to
the Asiatic empire never was wider open than now
and that nobody is'keeping them out
Mrs. Frances Meyer of Illinois wishes to be nomi
nated for Governor, and it is to be hoped she will
be satisfied, for her platform is as lovely as. a divided
slcirt. She is quoted as saying: "I belong to no party,
yet in me and my principles are centered all the best
elements of the five preat parties in our country. I
would be an independent Governor, but by principle
I am a Republican and Democrat of the highest
grade."
The Business Men's Republican Club in this city
has demanded that care be exercised in the selection
of candidates for Superior Judges. That demand was
based upon evidence published by The Call in con
nection with the probate frauds. It is now evident
that equal good care should be taken hereafter in se
lecting Police Judges. Case shirkers on the bench
are about as disgraceful to a judiciary as anything
that can be imagined.
There are two things about the matter the public
would like to understandâ first, why should Police
Judges seek to shift and shirk any duties of an office
to which they are so eager to get elected? Second,
what is there about the Chretien case that renders
every official so eager to let him alone? The Bar
Association has not been eager to deal with his
offense, the District Attorney was for a time at any
rate far from displaying any great amount of activity
in prosecuting the charges, and now it appears the
Police Judges do not wish to hear the case. There
must be something very peculiar about the relations
of Chretien to bench and bar since there are so many
peculiar things in their way of handling him after The
Call has exposed his offense and forced him to an
open confession.
The proceedings in the matter were for a time as
farcical as they were serious. Police Judge Fritz de
cided he could not hear the case before he took his
vacation, so he passed it on to Judge Conlan, and that
dignitary came to the conclusion it would be inju
dicious for him to hear it, so he "passed the back*'
to Judge Cabaniss. who declared he would have been
willing to try the case had it been regularly assigned
to him, but was afraid such a proceeding on his part
would be irregular and make, trouble. So they one
and all made excuses, and it took a lecture* from the
acting Mayor to get them to take up the case.
Cabaniss will hear it. Conlan, to whom it was as
signed, managed to make a successful shirk of it, and
is doubtless feeling happy.
So serious did the affair become that the acting
Mayor (Tobin) was compelled to summon the
Police Judges and require of them an explanation of
their conduct. When they appeared before him Mr.
Tobin is reported to have said the affair of Chretien
is a reflection on the bar of the city, and that it is
due to the bar as well as to the public that the ac
cused be given a speedy hearing, so that if he be
guilty punishment may not be delayed. All that is
irue, but the acting Mayor should have added that
the shifting of the case from one Police Court to
another is a reflection on the bench, and that the
Judges should have some regard for their own repute
as well ?.s for that of the. bar.
OUT of the Chretien case there has arisen a
side scandal hardly less disgraceful to the ad
ministration of law than the probate frauds
themselves. In riie ordinary process of law Chretien's
examination must take place before a Police Judge,
and it would seem to be the easiest thing in the world
to have accomplished it without delay. For some rea
son, however, the Police Judges did not wish the
case; one after another of them shirked it by shifting
it along, and for a time it looked as if Chretien would
go free from a lack of a Judge willing to try him.

But, seriously, silver is doing quite well for itself.
Mr. Bland, amiable and ambitious gentleman, is dead,
physically; may he rest in peace. Mr. Bryan Is equally
deceased, politically; may his dreams be pleasant.
But, after all, that was^a close shave that Mr. Bland
prepared for the country just to show Mr. Randall
that his light could not be hid under a bushel. That
little clash of ambitions and Mr. Randall's praise
worthy habit of paying his debts cost the United
States Treasury three hundred millions, gave the
country a scare in 1806 that makes it shiver yet, and
had in it the potentiality to close every bank between
the two oceans, suspend specie payment and make the
treasury go broke, if Mr. Bryan had been elected four
years ago. Mr. Bland's scheme had in it as much as
that of Douglas, for the ruin wrought by the Civil
War was hardly greater than would have followed the
success of Mr. Bland's plan to "do something for
silver."
THE GOLD DEMOCRATS.
BY unanimous vote the National Committee of
the National Democracy decided at Indianapo
lis on Wednesday not to put a ticket in the field
themselves nor to combine or fuse with the anti
imperialists. The sentiment of all of them, with but
one exception, was declared to be that all Democrats
who stand for sound money should in this campaign
be left free to support McKinley and give the death
blow to Bryanism. The one member of the commit
tee whose sentiments differed from those of his col
leagues declared his opposition to the nomination of
a Presidential ticket to be due to a determination to
vote for Bryan. Thus out of the nineteen committee
men who were present representing the conservative
Democracy of the country eighteen stand for Repub
licanism in this contest and one goes over to the Bry
anites. The division of sentiment among the party will
I probably be in about the same proportion, so that the
j gain which the Bryanites will get from the sound
j money Democracy will be overwhelmed by that which
I will accrue to the Republican ticket.
The one deserter from the cause of sound money,
W. D. Haldemand of the Louisville Courier-Journal,
explained his course by declaring: "My heart goes
out to those who struggle for liberty in every nation,
I and I applaud and approve the expression in the
Democratic platform sj-mpathizing with the Boers."
It thus appears that the Bryanites did really catch
one gudgeon with that bait. ' It is not easy to under
stand, however, what any sane man can expect Bryan
to do for the Boers, and, accordingly, Mr. Haldc
mand's explanation will be regarded aS- nothing more
{ than an excuse for getting back into the ranks of
Bourbon Democracy of his State. He has not had
I the courage to be faithful to his convictions, and sur
renders under a pretense of having found a new issue
superior to all those embodied in the Bryan platform
adopted at Chicago znd reaffirmed and reiterated at
Kansas City.
\ Not many Gold Democrats arc likely to follow
such leading. One of the ablest of the party in New
England, Frank Jones of New Hampshire, formerly
a member of the Democratic National Committee',
recently declared: "The attempt to make the issue
of imperialism seems to me to be an effort to force
to the front a political quarrel as to what this country
ought to do three, four or. five' years from now, when
everybodvagrees as to what it \ ought to do now.
Porto Rico is our territory, Cuba is to be delivered
over to the Cubans shortly, and as to the Philippines,
: So Mr. Bland concluded that he would use the
coinage committee to do something for silver and
! turn a little place into a big one. It has always been
j believed that aside from not intending to do harm,
j his motive was solely a personal one, to show Mr.
I Randall that he could not be squelched under the
j weights nor jammed into the measures over which
that little committee had jurisdiction.
Hence the Bland act, the compulsory purchase of
silver, its coinage into dollars and all that followed.
The Government entered the market as a compulsory
purchaser of the metal, to the amount of the Ameri
! can output. Silver ran up a little .at first, and then
began to fall. But Mr. Bland's bill was doing as
much for silver as ever, still it fell. It got below a
i dollar. Then Mr. Bland concluded that something
more must be done for silver, and the Sherman act
was passed. This second dose increased the decline
of the patient, and silver still fell, though the Govern
ment was buying it aid storing the bullion, against
which it issued currency certificates. Then Mr.
I Bryan appeared in the, field, with eyes aflame and lanes
i atilt, announcing that something must be done for
I silver, and tve had the campaign of 1806. On the ap
! pearance of this new champion silver nearly gav e up
I the ghost, and went down faster than a stock-ticker
! could follow it. The dollar made of it shrank to
I about 45 cents, and except that law held a gold dollar
! behind it that would have been its purchasing power.
! Being down, it stayed down. Its friends stood around,
like the seconds at a prize-fight, and counted the
time, until it was counted out by the single gold stan
dard bill. Its rival metal walked off with the belt,
and Bryan was left lamenting.
Now that his defeat is certain, and rrobody is doing
anything for silver, and there is no more prospect of
its free coinage than there is of Sullivan entering the
I ringand beating Jeffries, silver is looking up. It is,
j in fact, getting to be a good thing in the market. A
silver dollar is worth 30 or 40 per cent more than it
was in 1896, and is still rising. It buys that much
more in the exchange of its intrinsic value than it
would buy in 1S96, had we been then and were we now
: en the silver standard, as Mr. Bryan desired that we
j- should be.
'Â¦Â¦ But all his breath was spent in cursing a dollar that
1 would not stand still, but increased in its purchasing
power. He represented silver as a virgin metal, in
capable of such a caper. But silver denies this by its
present conduct. Had we been on the silver standard
I four years ago a dollar would have bought 45 cents'
I worth of commodities, and now it would buy at least
40 per cent more. Go to, Mr. Bryan, with your
vestal dollar that cuts such capers among decent
people!
WHEN Bland concluded in 1878 that something
must be done for silver it was about $i 25 an
ounce, but little below par with gold at 16 to 1.
â¢The value of an ounce of pure gold being $20.6864, it
follows that sixteen ounces of silver at $1.2929 per
ounce equal in value one ounce of gold. So that in
j 1878 silver was only the decimal below the gold par
j at that ratio. Mr. Bland had been put at the head of
I the committee on coinage, weights and measures by
j Speaker Randall. Morrison and Randall had been
competitors for the Speakership. Bland had sup
ported Morrison, and Mr. Randallâ well, he always
paid his debts, both ways, so Mr. Bland was put at
the head of a committee that makes a report about
once in ten years. He was mindful of the example
j of Stephen A. Douglas, who was demoted to the
I Committee on Territories, and from that small place
[ tore the Missouri Compromise to tatters, reopened
' the slavery question, ?nd, ten years after Mr. Clay's
I omnibus bill passed, had the country in a civil war.
SILVER RISING.
The common sense of the country agrees with these
views. The real issue is Bryanism as opposed to
prosperity, conservatism and national honor. The
'election of Brj r an wouid be even more dangerous now
than it wquld have been in 1896, and among the
stanch sound money Democrats who opposed him
then there will be very few who will vote for him
now.
A similar view of the. comparative importance of
the two issues was stated - by Oswald Ottendorfer,
editor of the Staats-Zeitung, who in discussing the
course the German Americans would take in the cam
paign said: "While German-Americans dread im
perialism more than anything else they have an idea
that it will take years to inculcate imperialistic no
tions in our Government. They also think that the
most rabid expansionists will not dare to go too far.
But with free silver it is different. German-Americans
always feel uneasy when the financial question is be
fore the country. They are a saving people, and the
uncertainty of the value of their savings is bound to
pgitate them. They insist upon a dollar of any kind
of money being worth 100 centsâ no more and no
less."
Mr. Bryan does not propose to bring our army and
navy away from those islands immediately any more
than Mr. McKinley does." â¢ .

â¢ Famous Italian Singers, Reach
San Francisco.
The distinguished grand opera singers.
Signers Guadenzio Salassa; Ferdinando
Avedano and Alc-ppandro Nicolini. arrived
Wednesday evenrn<? direct from Italy.
They are at the Palace Hotel. Accom
panying: the singers is Dr. Luiffi Maicllo.
Af. the special request of the famous com
poser, Verdi, he has come to San Fran
cisco to watch over 'the health of the
singers, who are special favorites of the
great Italian composer.
Slgnors Salassa and Avedano are well
known in ?an Francisco, where last vear
they scored a great success at the Tlvoli
Opera-hou?e, the management of which
has brought them out apjain for the forth-
romingr prarxl opera season, which will
bÂ«?grin next Monday. SIgnor Xicolinl has
never before visited this city, and musi
cal circles are much interested in the
debut here of the great basso profundo.
J Sigrnor Salassa and SIgnor Avodano.
through an Interpreter, declared that
after the very hot journey across the con
tinent, It was like "entering Paradise to
get a breath of the fresh salt air of San
Francisco." Both the singers have been
the pu^sts for many months of the com
poser. Verdi, at his beautiful home, Monte
Catini.
"I had many offer? to sing." said SIgnor
Salassa, "and so had my friend, Avedano,
but the maestro desired us to rest with
him. so that we could interpret his works
to the audiences this season in San Fran
cisco while we were In good condition.
"If we had puhr- during the season in
Europe, we would have required a long
rest; as it is. we have had our rest, and

tons. At the time of the Introduction of
the railway it was considered remarkable
that an engine could make twenty-five or
thirty miles an hour. At the present time
we are familiar with speeds as high as
eighty and ninety miles an hour.
The freight cars of the present time.
Instead of carrying five tons, are built to
transport frcm thirty to fifty tons each,
and the freight train has Increased its
load from 100 to 2000 tons. This marvelous
development in speed of travel and In vol
ume of trainload has been accompanied
by an equally grreat Improvement in the
comforts of travel and in the speed and
regularity of traffic movements. Freight
trains carrying 1000 to 1300 tons of freight
are dispatched 1<XK) miles or more accord-
Ing to a schedule that is as strictly ad
hered to as are passenger schedules.
Effects on Commerce.
Transportation is the handmaid of trade
Whatever enables this handmaid to do h<?r
work cheaper and quicker enlarges the
scope and volume of the worlds comÂ«
meree. When one considers that it cost
nearly four times as" much In 1ST3 to ship
wheat from Chicago to New York as It
does twenty-five years later one can read
ily understand how transportation has re
moved the hindrances to inland and for
eign commerce.
Effects Upon Industry.
Another effect of the modern transpor
tation system has been to make possible
and to hasten the substitution of produc
tion on a large scale for production on a
small scale. The manufacturing carried
on in the homes and in the small factories
is everywhere frivin? way to the industries
of the larpe factories. Jn nearly all forms
of industry production on a large scale by
means of preat aggregations of capital i*
th? rule. In manufacture. In mining and
lumbering this is notably so. In the mer
cantile business and to some extent In
agriculture there is manifest a tendency
to extend the scope of the Individual busi
ness organization. It is improved trans
portation which has made this possible
The substitution of production on a
large scale for small industries has been
accompanied by another important indus
trial change consisting of the localization
of the leading hinds of production In
localities possessing special advantages.
As long as the crude materials of indus
try and the commodities to be marketed
could be transported any considerable dis
tance only by slow and expensive meth
ods ,it was necessary for all forms of in
dustry to be as widely distributed as pos
sible, in order that producers and con
sumers mipht bÂ«! kept close toeether; but
tho modern transportation system has
largely changed this. Now the various
industries are respectively located where
the net balance of advantages is greatest.
This localization of industry has resulted
in an international and a local distribu
tion of productive enterprises. The peo
ple of the. I'nited Kingdom have long
since decided to devoto themselves mainly
to manufacture and. commerce, buying
most of their food supplies of people liv
ing in regions Â¦ where agriculture can be
carried on more advantappoualy. In New
Kncland and the northeastern part of the
United States a similar industrial fhange
is in progress. For two decades the va
rious woolen industries o.f the United
States, for instance, have been rapidly
concentrating in New England and" the
North Atlantic States, while those States
have at the same time been buying in
creasing amounts of flour, meats and
other foods from the Western States.
The manufacture of iron and steel in the
United States is now largely confined to
Pittsburgh Cleveland. Birmingham. Chi
cago and a few other cities especially fa
vorably located as regards fuel supplies
and shipping facilities. Numerous other
similar illustrations will suggest them
selves to the reader.
Transportation and Production.
In the recent writings of the political
economists much more attention than was
formerly piven has been devoted to the
influence which the consumption of poods
exerts upon their production. Realizing
that mankind as a whole produces in or
der that it may consume, economists have
made a study of the wants of men and
of the ways in which they seek to satisfy
N'ext Monday night the local camps of
the Woodmen of the World, one of the
recognized fraternal organizations of the
United States, will give their friends a
big theater party at the Grand Opera
house. In this the camps on the other
side of tho bay will assist. The San Fran
cisco camps are: Golden Gate So. 64,
Redwood No. 91. Mission Xo. 264, Western
Addition No. 3**5, Tamalpais No. 427, Calu
met No. 43Â»5. San Francisco No. 437 and
Richmond Xo. 475. The pioneer of these
In this city is Golden Gate Camp, which
has a membership of nearly 120), and it
has a degree team which will be sent to
Salt Lake City in August to compete for
a trophy during the Supreme Head Camp
session, to be held there.
All the camps are anxious that Golden
Gate's team should carry off the honors,
and they have united on the proposition
to devise ways and means to defray Its
expenses. One of the means was the se
curing of the Grand Opera-house for the
night named. From the advance sale of
tickets it is apparent that thf;re will be a
crush and that the house will be packed
to its limit. The attraction that, evening
will be "The Great Ruby." as given dur
ing the many nights that it has been pre
sented by the Frawley company, which
includes Wilton Lackaye. Miss Van Buren
and many other players who are well
known.
Western Addition Camp, a firm ally of
Golden Gate, has secured a box, as "has
also Tamalpais Camp. Boxes have been
offered for the use of visitors from camps
across the bay. and there is considerable
rivalry for choice of these and of seats.
The house has been secured for Monday
r.ight by Golden Gate Camp, which has
paid Manager Morosco the price charged.
A taking feature will be a drill in the am
plified form by the members of the team
that Is to visit Salt Lake. To those -who
have never seen Woodmen drill this will
be a decided novelty.

WOODMEN OF

THEATER PARTY
Justin Ladagnous. the Former Pro
prietor, Now Seeking a Subordi
nate Position in the Old
Restaurant.
I ?
Gilded youth and Impecunious society
men who would not pay their bills until
pressed, and then went elsewhere, have
worked the undoing 1 of Justin Ladagnous,
one of the oldest and best known restau
rateurs of San Francisco. He has turned
over the Maison Riche, 104 Grant avenue,
which he had conducted for fifteen years,
to several of his chief .creditors, and for
himself is seeking a clerical position, the
salary attached to which would pay for
but very few dinners at his once famous
place.
Ladagnous has been In financial trouble
for several years. The time was when the
Maison Riche was the resort of million
aire miners and merchants, the gilded
youth and the swagger set. Any one who
had said that the genial proprietor was
not coining money would have been
laughed at by those Â¦who knew something
of the amount of money that passed
through his hands.
In reality the golden opportunity was
lost. Ladagnous conducted his business
with a liberality that leU but little coin
In the till. Presently times began to
change and his business felt it first. Even
the men who live at high-priced French
restaurants can come down to the four-bit
sort if driven to it by a light purse. Then
other restaurants, newer and sweller In
equipment, were established near the
Maison Riche and cut deeply into its busi
ness.
Most fatal of all his business misfor
tunes. Ladagnous had a class of patrons
who rolled high on credit. The genial pro
prietor was lenient and let their bills run.
Two years ago he had such accounts run
ning well up into the thousands, and get
ting in financial straits he pressed the
debtors so persistently that nearly all of
them paid up â but went elsewhere with
their custom.
Three months ago Ladagnous. sick from
worry, went to Byron Springs for a rest.
After a few weeks he notified his broth
er-in-law, J. P. Lartigau. and A. Vignler.
the liquor merchant, who were his chief
creditors, that he had given up the strug
gle. They have taken charge of the busi
ness and it is now being conducted for
them.
Nominally the Maison Riche was owned
by a corporation, but practically all the
stock was held by I^adagnous. Lartigau
holds a. chattel mortgage on the restau
rant for $7000 ac security for the amount
for which he sold a half-interest in the
business In palmier days. Vlgnier is
surety to Davis Brothers on a five-year
lease of the premises, amounting to J33.
000. Lartigau and Vignier intend to run
the place until they can dispose of it to
advantage. Meanwhile they promise the
other creditors payment in full. E. Meyer
&; Co. have bills against the Maison Riche
amounting to about $300, and about that
much more Is owing to other creditors.
Ladagnous is with Ills family in Fruit
vale, living in rented property. Through
the influence of friends he expects to get
a clerical position that will afford his
family a meager living. Thus has fickle
Fortune turned her back on the once pros
perous partner of John Somali In the pro

The Occidental and Oriental Steamship
Company's Coptic sailed for the Orient
yesterday. She will stop on the way at
Honolulu, but took neither passeng-ers nor
cargo for that port. Very few Chinese
went out on the steamer, while in the
cabin there were only four passengers for
China. At least fifteen or twenty people
who had taken passage on the vessel
backed out -when the news from Peking.
Tientsin and Shanghai began to filter
through.
Those who went away on the Coptic
are:

Alameda's Great Hun.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's mail
steamer Alameda arrived yesterday from
Sydney. N. S. W., via Auckland. Apia and
Honolulu, nearly a day ahead of time.
The actual running- time was 5 days 21
hours and 30 minutes. The average cpeed
from Auckland to Honolulu was 14.5 knots,
and from Honolulu to San Francisco 14.S
knots. The Alameda will be seventeen
years old on August 5. and has never been
laid up a day since she was built.
Tug for Honolulu Trade.
The splendid new tug- Fearless sails for
Honolulu early this morning. The trade
in the islands warrants the stationing 1
there permanently of a large, ocean-going
vessel for towing purposes, so the Fear
less of the Spreckels Tugboat Company
poes to Honolulu to take care of the bust
ness. Captain Gilbert Brokaw. formerlv
of the Reliance, is in command of the
Fearless, while Bert Wheeler has charge
of the engine room. Captain Marshall of
the Fearless is now in command of the
Reliance, but will take the new tug as
scon as she arrives from New York. This
vessel is called the l>ewis Luckenback,
and Captain McCoy, superintendent of the
Spreckels Towboat Company, and Chiof
Engineer Holtx of the Alert are now in
the East to bring her here. Chief Engi
neer Driscoll of the Fearless is now in
charge of the engine room of the Alert.
More Tugs Depart.
The Fearless has over 1W tons of coal
in her bunkers and in sacks on deck, and
Captain Brokaw says this will be ample
to take her to Honolulu. The captain ex
pects to make the run in about nine days.
For the trip Captain Brokaw has rierged
a large squaresail on the Fearless, which
adds greatly to her sailing quality* and
to her appearance.
The "Red Stack" tup Rescue started for
PuRet Sound yesterday. She will assist
the tujr Tatoosh in towing 1 an enormous
lop raft to San Francisco. Should the
towboats. have as much success as they
did last year about half of the raft will
get here.
The tug Monarch has taken the tug
Rescue's place in the Ventura oil trade.
For several weeks to come she will be
towing oil barges up and down the coast.
Water Front Notes,
There are now three ships posted as
missing on the Merchants' Exchange
blackboard. The Louise is 23S days out
from Tampa for Yokohama and 90 per
cent is being paid to reinsure her. The
Nith is 163 days out from Tampa for Syd
nev N S. X?A and 40 per cent is being
paid on her. while the Melanope. now out
iO days from Panama for San Francisco,
only pays 5 per cent. y
The four-masted schooner Muriel will
sail for the north in a few days to load
lumber for Noumea, New Caledonia. This
makes four vessels that have left here
within a short space of time for the
French penal settlement, and several
others are booked for that point during
the present month. Formerly New Cale
donia eot all its lumber from New Zea

these wants, and the rt-sult of thla study
has bÂ»en the acceptance of the principle
that the kind and quantity of goods pr>>
ducfd is determined by the variety and
intensity of men's wants. It follows as a
natural consequence of thts principle that
the forces or agencies which modify
men's wants exert an Influence upon the
productive activities which society anÂ«l in
dividuals carry on to satisfy those wants.
Man'* wants are complex and the forces
which influence thÂ«m are so many that
it tvculd not be in place to enter upon an
analyst of them here. Wants, like appe
tites, "grow upon what they feed." and as
the consumable commodities available for
use are In large part determined by the
conditions of transportation, and have
been greatly increased in variety and
quantity by improvements in the means
of transportation, it is obvious that the
many modifications which human wants
have undergone during thÂ» last century
have been to a large txtent made possi
ble by the evolution that has taken place
during that time in the technique of
transportation. This increase and these
changes in human wants have been re
flected in the manifold changes in pro
duction that have revolutionized indus
try and multiplied in kind and quantity
the commodities that now minister to the
satisfaction of the wants of a complex
and highly developed civilization.
Transportation and Labor.
The real wages of a day's labor are the
commodities which the days labor will
secure. Transportation has had no more
patent effect than that of increasing the
variety and quantity of useful things
which come within the range of the toil
er's income. The luxuries or" or.e genera
tion or one decade become recognized
necessities of the succeeding generation
or decade, and among the many forces,
industrial and social, which have maue
this possible the evolution of transporta
tion must take first rank.
Transportation has increased the real
wages of worklngmen. and accompanying
this increase, partly as cause and partly
as consequence, there has been an en
hancement of the efficiency of labor. Ref
erence Is not made here to the Influence
upon the output of labor which has bee:i
and is being exerted by improvements in
machinery, including the mechanism of
transportation, but to the fact that t tie
effect of transportation has been to give
the laborer better food and clothing and
make him a more intelligent man. Thus
equipped he is a more skillful and efficient
artisan. Probably also the cheap travel
which transportation has made possible*
has so augmented the mobility of labor
?s to make it possible for the laborer to
secure more steady employment. \\ ork
ingmen are able to seek work where the
demand Is strongest.
Relation to Social Welfare.
Transportation is massing the formerly
eistributftd Industrial population, and to
some extent the rural population in the
large cities, whither an increasing pro
portion of the manufacturing enterprises
are being established. There are. c!
course other reasons -why men are mov
ing to the citiesâ one being the social ad
vantages which the city afford3â but tha
main cause for the growth of cities is in
dustrial, and that cause is operative and
potent because of the Industrial changes
which have accompanied the development
cf transportation. The growth of great
cities, the consequent establishment of
such a large percentage of the population
in the surroundings of life which preva:l
in the cities, bas produced social benefits
that have often been underrated; but it
has also placed certain groups of society
in very unwholesome and immoral sur
roundings.
The slum population of our cities consti
tutes a social excrescence whose exist
ence Is due to the crowding of population
In the great industrial and commercial
centers. Though deplorable, the evils of
city life are remediable. They represent
a phase of the present period of transition
from the more segregated life of former
g-enerations to the conditions of congre
gated existence. The social evils -whicn
have manifested themselves with tha
growth of cities will be met and overcoma
in turn and good conditions will be estab
lished. Indeed, the very agency that has
done more than any other to mass men
in the crowded cities Is now doing much
by means of the electric cars and other
form* of rapid transit to enable the city
population to spread out so as to avoid
overcrowding. The industrial population,
of the city is no longer compelled to live
In the congested districts adjacent to Its
nlaee of employment, but may live in tha

outer portions of the city, or even in tee
suburbs, where the advantages of rural
and urban life are combined.
The economic and social Influences
which transportation exerts are not
bounded by national limits. An important
consequence of transportation and com
munication has been that of bringing thÂ»
nations of the world Into closer economic
and social relations. "With the Rrowir.fr
solidarity of the economic interests of the
coustries of the world, with the multipli
cation of the intellectual and other social
ties that unite nations, their political re
lations Inevitably change, and for the bet

COMPARATIVE STUDIES OF TWO CENTURIES.
The technical improvements in the
means of transportation which 'have done
most to revolutionize travel and traffic
during the last 100 years are the invention
of macadam and tolford roads, the appli- |
cation of the steam engine to river and j
ocean commerce and the Introduction of
the steam and electric railways. Future
writers on transportation will doubtless
be obliged to dwell at some length upon
the social and Industrial changes brought
about by the bicycle and the automobile.
Their introduction has so recently taken
place that the consideration of their influ

Found a Counterfeiter's Kit
A boy picked up on Fulton street yes
terday a tin box, ,in which were several
counterfeit silver dollars and half dollars
and also some plaster of Paris molds. He
took the articles to Police Sergeant Bur
nett at the O'Farrell-street station, who
forwarded them to Secret Service Agent
Hazen. The whole outfit was so crude
that Hazen believes them to be the work
of an amateur counterfeiter, .who was
afraid to have it found upon his person.

Robert Fulton Invented a workable
steamboat for river service, the Clermont.
in 1S07. and within a few years it had
come Into general use on the numerous
navigable waterways of the United
States. By 1S19 the adaptability of the
steam engine to the propulsion of the
ocean vessel had become a demonstrated
fact, although it was not until fifteen
years later that transoceanic steam navi-
t FULTON'S STEAMER. +
gatlon really came Into existence. In
these latter days of larpe ocean vessels
we hardlv realize how small the otfean
ships were 100 years ago. The Grand
Turk, of 564 tons, constructed in 1731, was
probably the largest ship built in Amer
ica up to that time. During the fourth
decade of the nineteenth century some
vessels of over 10X1 tons were constructed,
and in 1S40 the large ship, the Great Brit
ain, of 3000 gross tons, was built. One hun
dred years asjo. however, a vessel of 300
tons was still considered a large ship, and
as late as 1S40 vessels of that size traded
from the United States to India and Chi
na. At the present time we have vessels
over TOO feet long, with a displacement of
28,500 tons and a draught of 32*4 feet. The
engines on these mammoth ships are
capable of developing 20.000 horsepower
and will carry 2000 or 3000 persons across
the ocean at the rate of over 500 miles a
day.
The evolution of the railway presents an
equally striking Illustration of the tech
nical evolution that has taken place in
the transportation machine during- the
last century. Stevenson's famous Rocket,
which won the prize in the contest at
Ralnhlll, England. In 1S29. weighed five
tons. Engines are now built weighing 100

"Wheatâ Liverpool and Paris futures were
lower.
Chicago opened firmer, but declined. The de
mand was moderate and the market was over
sold. Minneapolis was weak and dull. The
Cincinnati Price Current still Insisted on a crop
of 650.000.000 bushels. Broomhall cabled in
fluential buying at Liverpool.
Guessing on the California crop Is active The
lowest estimate is 450.000 and the highest 750,000
tons, a reduction nf 300,000 tons from ante-har
vest estimates. The most conservative opinion
Inclines to a crop of 650,000 tons.

Oats were easy. Tnule was slow. September
closed Nc down at 22%c. Provisions suffered
from the heavy run of hogs. Â¦ Speculation was
flat and the demand had somewhat fallen from
what It has been recently. September closed
17 r -c under yesterday. Lard 7%c down and Ribs
7i,c reduced.
The leading futures ranged as follows:
Corn was affected at times by the early heav
iness in Wheat and the prospects of a big
crop; at others by the excellent shipping de
mand. The recovery of Wheat during the last
hour had a beneficial effect on Corn, but the
recovery was not complete. September closed
a shade lower at Z1%ft31Â¥ t c.
CHICAGO. July 26.â At the beginning of trade
In the Wheat pit the market derived firmness
under the influence of %d advance at Liverpool
and yesterday's indications of foreign willing
ness to buy the great American cereal at pre
vailing prices. September opened UfiVi to 4jÂ©
H over yesterday at 7r,-y 4 @76c. Then considera
tions of a different kind were impressed upon
the talent. Liverpool showed Inability to hold
Its early advance; the Southwest sold in an
ticipation of heavy receipts and the price cur
rent declared that despite the Pacific Coast
shrinkage the yield of Wheat In this country
would aÂ«greKate5.",0,OOO.eOO bushels. This estimate
was regarded with a smile by some, but lt was
influential with others. The outside speculation
was lax and September, with occasional spasms
of recovery, gradually sagged to 74}ic.
At the bottom there was covering by shorts
on renewed talk of cash sales and on the
receipts, which were less thap last year's
at the primary points. September rallied In
active order to 75Â»ic and closed firm >4c over
yesterday at 7."%'575?4c.

vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The markets here were heavy during the early
part of the session, but In the afternoon there
was a sharp revival of tone, on a scramble
among the bears to reduce their commitments
in home railway shares. There was no news
from abroad, excepting concerning the forward
movement of Lord Roberts. Americans were
very few and dull. Paris has been buying

it did a month ago. I^ate mall advices from
New York say: "Dried Fruit men here have
as yet felt no direct effects, so far as can be

The Prune situation continues very uncertain.
The crop Is running so Irregular in size that the
Association has again deferred the announce
ment of opening prices in order to see what
percentage of larze sizes there will be before
making quotations. The date is now fixed at
August 10. The bulletin of the Association Just
issued reports that the drop still continues, and
that the June drop has now become merged
into the July drop, and that crop estimates of
ten days ago have been materially reduced.
Complaints of defective fruit are also becoming
genernl.
Peaches and Pears are steady, and choice lots
are readily taken up. Evaporated Apples are
opening low and weak.
The Dried Fruit market has begun to Im
prove materially during the past few days, and
from present Indications we will have a much
better market than we have been expecting.
Apricots lead In firmness. The early output,
which was composed chiefly of small and poor
fruit, is already about cleaned up, and the
later and larger fruit Is firm and advancing.
Tho yield is now given at 900 Instead of 1000
cars. The demand is brisk and increasing, and
the advanced quotations will be Been below.

i Â¦ t.stify regarding the manner in which
department horses were shod. Judge Heb
l ard remarked that it was evident that
the presence in court of the h*-ads of the
department and s=o many of their subor
dinates was against the interests of proo
<>rty owners and hÂ» suggested that coun

stenographer, visit the various fire houses
and take the testimony, thus permitting
the firemen- to return to their quarters.
This plan was not acceptable to counsel
vit,h the result that all were examined on
the witness stand. Their testimony re
latrd to the shoeing of horses with" rub
ier, oakum ar.d other materials, but none
Â«-'<uld throw any light on Kennedy's con
tention that the board had discriminated

A. Sbarboro, the well-known banker and
president of the Manufacturers' and Pro
ducers' Association, is now in Italy. He
has written an interesting letter to E.
Goodwin, manager of the association, in
which comparisons between the Kast and
Kurope and this State are made. -Mr.
Sbarboro has been absent three month?,
and will prolong his visit three months
more. On account of his stay in Italy he
tendered his resignation, which the asso
ciation refused to accept. The letter was
written in Rome on the 6th inst., and in
it Mr. Sbarboro says:
Sine* I have left Ean Francisco I have seen
enough to make me quite a railroad man. All
the cities of the Eastern States owe their grtat
ness and prosperity to railroads. They are all
KTidironed with railroad tracks and their de
pots are some of their finest buildings and gen
erally In the very heart of the city. You un
doubtedly remember the two grand railroad de
pots in Philadelphia, right near the new City
Hall, eo convenient to the traveling public.
These buildings cost millions of dollars and
have given wurk to thousands of peuple for
years. A one or two million dollar building
opposite the City Hall would be of great bene
fit to San Francisco. Even here in Rome a
tine railroad depot I? situated near the center
of the city close to the best hotels.
How do*>s Europe compare with San Fran
cisco? Well, Europe is ahead of us In some
thine?, but we are not behind them in Others.
All tho great cities of Europe have made vast
improvements in the past thirty years. In
Fome rases entire districts in cities have been
changed from email streets and poor buildings
t<j wide boulevards and magnificent buildings.
This has been the case notably In Paris. Genoa,
Rome and Milan. These cities have had pro
gressive citizens and good city officials:. They
also have a remarkably good law in the mat
ter of award for damages for property taken
for public improvements. If the property
owner is not satisfied with the award, which
is generally a liberal one. the building is re
moved and the dispute settled afterward. Thus
no unreasonable obstructionist can stop the
march of Improvements for an indefinite period
of time. I assure you. sir, that if that plague
spot of Chinatown was In the heart of any
city either In the United States or Europe it
would not remain there three months. It has
already cost San Francisco more than several
times Its value. People I talk with cannot
understand how we can tolerate such a terrible
plague spot in our midst. I hope to see the day
when a beautiful garden 'will take Its place.
Europe, however, la away behind us in sev
eral practical upeful thlnrs. The elevator,
tven in Paris, and at the principal hotels, goes
up go flow that people generally prefer walk
ing. The telephone is not generally used as
we do, and as to Ions-distance telephone, it
is hardly known. What I do moet miss, how
ever, la my typewriter. You would hardly be
lieve that neither public office*, banks or large
commercial houses have any typewriters. Even
testimony in the courts is all taken down as la
the time of Cicero, In lonf? hand.
You have often heard of the famous Riviera.
It Is a stretch of land near the fleashore, ex
tending from Nice, in France, on the Ponente
(west), to Hpezia, in Italy, on the Levante
(east). This favored country, which contains
besides Nice, Cannes, Mentone, Monte Carlo
(the world-famed gambling castle), Hordlghera
â¢ Immortalized In Ruffino's "Dr. Antonio"). San
Remo, Savona, Teglla (with the celebrated
Villa PalavIcinU, Genova, Rapallo, Recco,
Santa Margherlta. Portoflno. Chiavarl and
Sestrl. Is admitted by all the world to be
the garden Fpot of Europe. Well, I traveled
nearly all this favored country in a carriage,
so that I might better enjoy the flower bed.i,
oraiiee, lemon and olive proves and its beau
tiful" scenery and climate and in order that I
migrht int^lllÂ«rently make a comparison of it
with California. .The result has beÂ«n that
without the fear of contradiction I can now
eay that on the whole Riviera there Is not a
tree, a palm, a flower, or a shrub that cannot
be produced to the Tame perfection within a
radius of one hundred mile* around our Pan
Francisco. Infect the peÂ°p!e. of the Riviera
know this, for they have named two of theii
best diBtrlcts. Â¦ 6ne In Nice and another at
Cannes. "California."
When I noticed on nn electric streetcar at
Nice, "Place Massona a Callfornle," I boarded
the ear, roÂ«ie out to "Californle" and found
Jt rÂ»ally a most beautiful Fpot. I asked the
Intelligent conductor why the plare was namta
"rallfnrnle?" He answered. "Hecause It 1*
the namp of a beautiful, country in . Africa,
where they produce the oranpe and the lemon,
the trees ami the flowers and everything thai
we produce here, only In California the dates
do mature to perfection, which is not the case
in Nice." Now, if we excuÂ«e the conductor's
want of Becjrraphlcal education and make al
lowance for the proverbial desire of the French
man to exaggerate In the reference to the ma
turing of the date, the balance was perfectly
correct. And to Bay that some of our wealthy
people leave California to spend their money
In Nice!
The time will come I am sure when tourists
will oome to California from all parts of tho
world, for we have many gifts of nature pos
sessed by no other country on the face of the
globe.
A. Sbarboro Says That in
Many Respects the West
Is Far Ahead.

Special Dl.Â«ratch to The Call.
NEW YORK, July 26.â The United

PACIFIC GROVE. July 26.â This was
American day In the Chautauqua Assem
bly and all the exercises were of a na
tional and patriotic character. The pub

the day in their bearing upon American
aiTairs and other questions which are
purely American occupied this time. As
any one who wishedâ whether a Chau
tauquan or not â was at liberty to take
part in the discussion, the morning was
far the most interesting to the general
public during the session.
At the afternoon session Chaplain
Isaacs of- the battleship Texas told the
story of the naval battle off Santiago, as
witnessed by him, and of the part in the
great light played by the Texas and her
commander, the late Rear Admiral Philip.

was also a feature of the afternoon and
the day's programme closed with an ad

and spirituality, he has also been most
liberal to the outside world, and In this
was much of his success. A series of ser

a few years aj?o, was a striking illustra

attention for their broadness of view that
they had to be printed in book and pam

Dr. Coyie has felt that a change in the
field of his operations might be beneficial
to himself and h!s work, and for this rea

"My future plans have not been deter

OAKLAND. July 26.â The resignation
of the Rev. Robert F. Coyle from
the pastorate of the First Presby

announced determination of going East, j
remove from Oakland one of the best I
known divines in the city. For nine years
Dr. Coyle has been at the head of the
First Presbyterian Church of this city,
and he has nearly doubled Its member
ship. During this time he has been beset
with calls from other churches from New
York City and other portions of this coast,
but he has always remained In Oakland.
Dr. Coyle has been a general favorite
in Oakland, not alone with the members
of his congregation but with the tran

A MYSTERIOUS robbing: story was
reported in the California-stitt-t
station last nipht. The amount in
volved is $1500, and the party from
whom it is alleged to have been taken is
a Ko!>ert Smith, formerly of Fresno.
About 7 o"cloctv last night Smith, in
pany with a friend, S. 11. Keiees. al^o of
Fresno, rode in from the Presidio on a
Union-street car and stopped at the cor
ner "f Montgomery avenue and Washing
ton street. Smith was badly Intoxicated
and his friend called a hack to drivr him
to his hotel. From the story it appears
that Reiergs had also drunk considerable
and forgot the location of the hotel.
IteiKRs ordered the driver to wait un
til he went into the Commercial Hotel
near by, until ho could inquire from the
clerk if that hotel was where they were
staying. When he came out to tne street
again he v.-as startled to iind Smith lying
on the sidewalk and the hack out of sight..
He Immediately reported tu the police that
(1500 had been taken from his friend's
person during the time he was in the
hotel.
r>etectives Gibson and Crockett were de
tailed tm tin: case and visited the Harbor
Hospital, where Smith had been taken.
They found that tli<? man had in his pos
spepjon $4>; when he was placed under
treatment. The patient was unable to
talk on account of the liquor he had
taken, hut it was learned that he had
worked on a ranch previous to his arrival
in this city and had received a salary of
$35 per month. His friend still insists that
he had the greater amount, hut the de
tectives came to the conclusion that he
did not know what he was talkintr about.

is so strong that It is expected to make
a clean sweep and return a solid native
Legislature. The members all profess to
be good Americans, but they* say they
are in a position to run their own Gov
ernment now and that they propose to
do so.
"It is commonly believed." continued
Mr. Parker, "that in the first national
election the Democrats will win out
strongly, not because of dissatisfaction
with McKinley, but as a matter of senti
ment. Cleveland was a Democrat and he
ordered the American flag hauled down
at Honolulu, whereof the Democracy is a
highly popular party among the Island
ers."
Those of the Nelll company registering
at the California were Charles A. Parker,
manager; Mr. Neill and -wir&r Miss Dean.
Miss Lamkin, Benjamin Howard and
Frank McVlckers.

NEILL COMPANY HAD
A SUCCESSFUL TRIP
Politics Growing Novel and Exceed
ingly Warm in the
Islands. -
The Neill company and. Charles. A. Par
ker, the manager , thereof, arrived from
Honolulu on the Alameda yesterday after
noon and after a long and , exasperating
delay were ;larided 9:30 at night.
The company played the first engagement
under American rule In the Islands, and
the trip, which was largely experimental
proved : very successful. . This - is shown
by the fact that the organization played
sixteen "nights to houses aggregating $15
000, the receipts for the last night being
$1400. i Â¦ "V
"There is considerable politics in the
islands these days,", said Mr. Parker last
evening. "Recently there has been organ
ized a new party which is bitterly opposed
to the missionary; element and. which has
had a remarkable grpwth." Its battle cry
is 'Hawaii for Ilawaiians.'. and the Darty
First Account of Sutro Estate.
The first annual account of Emma L.
Merritt and "W. R. H. Adamson. execu
trix and executor of the estate of the late
Adolph Sutro, was filed yesterday. The
account shows that frorp January 19, 1899,
to February 1, 1900. the'executrix and ex
ecutor have received $297,750 11 and have
expended $25S.95G 45, leaving a balance of
$38,793 C6 Â¦ on Â¦ hand. The list of bills due
amount to J29S7 52 and the list of indebted
ness on realty mortgages sums up $518,
Â£69 26. while claims approved amount to
$C5R,749 83. The liabilities of the Sutro
Railroad Company at the time of sale
amounted to $110,619 30, all. of which was
assumed by the Sutter-street Railroad
Company. The account contains an ap
proved demand, subject to the . order of
court, made by Lloyd & "Wood and E. W,
and-J. C. McKlnstry. for $10,000. Many
lawsuits are still pending, and from their
number It is evident that years will elapse
before the estate is ready for final distri

It was suggested that Judge Cabaniss
should be appointed presiding Judge pro

at once said that he* would take the Chre-
Judges a transfer of a case had to be
signed by the Judge of the court to which
it was assigned by the presiding Judge,
and his consent had never been asked. lie
had endeavored to see Judge Fritz before
he left, but failed. He did not object to
taking the case, but he had to try the
poolroom cases and others, and his time
was fully taken up for some days at least.
Judge Cabaniss said he had no objec
tion to taking the case, but he was afraid
that the defense might raise the technical
point that he had no authority to hear it.
as it had been legally transferred to
Judge Conlan by the presiding Judge. The
charter did away with all rules that
might have existed before it came into
force, the ma?ristrate said.
THE humiliating spectacle of attor
neys for the prosecution and defense
seeking in vain for a Judge to try
the charge of forgery against John
M. Chretien, the disgraced attorney, was
brought to an end yesterday morning,
when the three Police Judges now sitting
appeared before acting Mayor Tobin in
response to his written request. Chief
Sullivan and District- Attorney Byington
were also present.
The acting Mayor said that the actions
of Chretien had disgraced the bar, and it
was due to the profession and to the pub
lic generally . that there should be a
speedy hearing of the case.
Judge Conlan explained that the case
had not been properly assigned to his
court by Judge Fritz as presiding Judge.
According to a rule in force among the
tien case and the conference ended.
Half an hour later Chretien's case was
called in Judge CabanJss' court. Attorney
Barnes for the defendant moved for a dis
missal, as the six days had elapsed since
his arrest within which the examination
should go on. The defendant had made
every effort to get a hearing, but had
failed.
The District Attorney was In court and
objected to the motion for dismissal. After
further argument it wa3 agreed that a
new complaint would be drawn and the
defendant rechirped on It. A continuance
was granted until this morning, when the
defendant will be arraigned and the ex

Joseph Peckerman, an employe of Zlck
Abrams' poolroom, was found guilty by a
Jury in Police Judge Conlan's court last
night of selling a pool ticket to Policeman
McNamara. The jury was out nearly six
hours and twice asked for additional In
struction before returning the verdict.
Policeman McNamara was the strongest
witness for the prosecution, but Captain
Wittman and Policeman Carr also testi
fied. They made out a clean case.
After announcing that the defense had
no testimony to offer Attorney Collins, in
behalf of Peckerman, addressed the jury.
He claimed that the prosecution had not
established the case. Inasmuch as It* had
failed to prove whether Abrams, the pro
prietor of the poolrooms, or the defend
ant sold the ticket which was introduced
as evidence. He also attacked the valid
ity of the ordinance prohibiting pool-sell
ing.
Special Prosecutor Joe CofCey reviewed
the evidence at length and asked that a
verdict of guilty be rendered.
The jury was charged at 6:15 o'clock last
evening and was placed in charge of
Bailiff Laws.
From the time the jurymen entered the
room set apart for them it was evident
that they could not agree. After deliberat
ing for some time the jury asked that the
court read the testimony of Policeman
Mclsamara, who arrested the defendant.
Ine Jurors were then brought into court
and after hearing the testimony of the of
ncer they were sent back to the jury
room. J '
At 10:30 o'clock last night the Jury, after
announcing Its failure to reach a verdict,
asked for further instructions as to what
constitutes the sale of a pool ticket and
the exact meaning of the word "sale."
Judge Conlan gave the jurors the legal
definition of the word and ordered them
taken back to the Jury room.
\\ hile they v/ere deliberating on a ver
dict several of the Jurors sat on the win
dow sill, on the McAllister-street side of
the City Hall. A number of men who
were in sympathy with the poolsellers
gathered near by and offered suggestions
to the jury. Chief Sullivan was apprised
of the fact and he detailed Detective Tom
Ryan to watch them. As they became
unusually bold In communicating with the
Jurors, Ryan ordered them to disperse,
which they did.
Lost a Juror.
When the Peckerman Jury was called
yesterday afternoon Attorney Coffey, rep
resenting the prosecution, asked that he
be permitted to question one of the Jurors
as to his qualifications, informating hav
ing been imparted to him since the jury
was sworn which made such a course
necessary. Judge Conlan granted the re
quest, and as a result N. A. Judd of the
Hlcks-Judd Printing Company was
peremptorily challenged, because his firm
had at one time printed tickets for the
pool-sellers, and Judd admitted that he
himself visited the races and purchased
pool tickets. Judge Conlan expressed re
gret that so prominent a citizen had been
humiliated in that manner, but was com
pelled to dismiss the juror. When Attor
ney Collins took an exception to the whole
proceed Ing Conlan remarked he "hoped

The police gained an Important advan
tage yesterdav before Judg? Shlw. Judge
Shaw refused to grant an interlocutory
injunction prohibiting the police from
stripping the premises of Â¦\Valter D. Val
entine, bucket-shop" operator at 43 Ellis
street, for the purpose of securing evi
dence against him. The court also re
fused to grant a mandatory injunction
compelling the police to return the evi
dence secured on Wednesday night's raid
The preliminary injunction Issued on the
filing of the complaint was dissolved and
in relation to Valentine's establishment
the police were given free rein
The complaint simply sets forth that on
Vi ednesday evening the police, contrary
to law, raided the premises and carried
away the property of the complainant.
After argument by counsel. Judge Shaw
decided that in entering the premises the
police were in search of evidence to be
used In a criminal prosecution, hence he
would not restrain them.
Vacated the "Writ.
On his own motion Judpe Shaw also va
cated the writ of Injunction Issued Wed
nescjny against the i>olice at the instance
or the poolsellers and bookmakers. The
court held that the Injunction heretofore
issued by Judge Murasky was sufficient
for the proceedings in contempt against
Chief Sullivan and Captains Splllane. Sey
mour and Wittman for their entry of
poolrooms in violation of its mandate.
When the contempt proceedings were
called by Judpe Shaw at 10 o'clock Com
missioners Wallace, McNutt and Maho
ney, together with Chief Sullivan and
Captains Splllane, Seymour and "Wittman,
were in court, but the action of Judge
Shaw In vacating the injunction issued by
himself, under which the contempt pro
ceedings were instituted, released them
from further attendance. A new citation
will now issue under the injunction issued
by Judge Murasky, returnable Saturday
morning at 10 o'clock, at which time the
police will explain how they came to ig
nore the injunction.
After Judge Shaw had handed down his
opinion and the police announced their in- j
tention of returning to Valentine's estab
lishment for the purpose of securing- new
evidence, Attorney George Collins, on be
half of his clients, the poolsellers, peti
tioned Chief Sullivan to have photographs
taken of the boards in the "bucket shop"
in place of tearing out the fixtures and
using them as evidence. His plea was
disregarded. Sergeant Tobin and Police
men McQuade and Klssane, acting under
orders of Captain Wittman, entered the
establishment at 43 Ellis street and tore
out boards and tickets. These were load
ed on a truck and taken to the City Hall,
where they will be used as evidence
against the gamblers.
