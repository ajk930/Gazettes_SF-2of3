KANSAS CITY. July 2.â Senator Teller
of Colorado was among to-day's arrival?.
He comes to attend the Silver Republican
Convention,, and probably will preside
over its proceedings.. Asked if he thought
the Democratic convention should makt
a specific declaration for the free coinage
of silver at the ratio of 15 to 1, he replied:
"Most 'emphatically I reply that such a
declaration should be made. The demand
for a simple reafflrmatlon of the Chicago
platform.' without other reference to
financial questions, comes from the goM
Democrats, who did not support Bryan In
1SSS. and it Is somewhat doubtful whethe
some who insist upon the pursuance of
this course will support him in 10u>> In
many States west of the Alleghenies thera
are thousands of voters who will support
Bryan and the Democratic party on ac
count of their position on the financial
question. These people believe in the free
coinage of silver at the ratio of 16 to 1
and they will regard a simple reafflrma
tion of the Chicago declaration as an at
tempt to minimize the silver question a*
presented in the Chicago platform. They
will not believe that such an omission is
insisted upon by the gold standard Dem
ocrats for any other purpose than to maka
it appear that the contention for free
silver coinage at 16 to 1 has been aban
doned by the Democratic party. Such 1^
undoubtedly the purpose of the gold ad.
vocates."

ver Issue .Would Mean
Utter Defeat.
TELLER'S ADVICE TO
THE DEMOCRACY
KANSaF CITY, July 2.â This is a copy of a message Bent by
Mr. Bryan to-day which, whipped all the veteran party lead
ers into line: -<^.:
"If by any chance the committee on resolutions decides to re
port a platform in which there is not a silver plank there must be
a minority report and a fight on the floor of the convention. I
will come to Kansas City on the fastest train available, make a
fight for silver on the floor of the convention, and then decline to
take the nomination if the convention omits the ratio. This is
final.''
This is substantially the silver plank Bryan has drafted for
the platform. It -was the plank read to Hill: "We hereby reaf
firm the platform adopted by the Democratic National Convention
at Chicago in 1896 as a whole and in all its integral parts, and
declare fcr the free and unlimited coinage of silver, without the
aid or conse-.it of any other nation, at the ratio of 16 to 1. WÂ©
demand that the standard silver dollar shall be full legal tender
equally with pold for all dtbts public and private, and we favor
such legislation as will prevent for the future the demonetiza
tion cf any kind of legal tender money by private contracts. We
are opposed to the policy and practice of surrendering to holders
of obligations the United States option reserved by law to the
Government of redeeming such obligations either in silver or
gold."

ANSAS CITY. July :.-Il!chard j
Croker to-day plunged tJ> Vice j
K Presidential situation into still j
greater confusion by derlariri* j n j
favor of Lewis Nixon for Vice |
President. Ke did not do so until he be- j

'vas introducing Dacfoith to delegates as

UÂ»Â« fcr Nixon, who i.* a former naval con-
Firurtor and an East River bridge com

a test ess* of Ftrenyth between Hill and
Ciokf-r in the New York delegation un
avoidable and Croker may even no so
far a? to attempt to keep Hi!! ofT the com
mittee oa resolutions.
Hill <-arse tack from his visit to Bryan j
with a prodigious flea in his ear. Bryan
refused absolutely to make a single con
cession rt-parding the financial plank. It

more than ever determined that the actual |
convention fhall be held on his front

They Pleaded in Vain. \

wore also Instructed to request Mr. Bryan i
to at least remain passive and permit the )
convention to exercise its Judgment, but i
lr this they failed, too. The Call cor
respondent Is informed by the highest !
possible aushcrity that should the com
mittee on resc!utions report a platform
tfc&i docs not. contain a specific lndorse-
mer.t of the 16 to 1 ratio Mr. Bryan will
come from Lincoln on a special train and
conduct the fight In favor of free silver
in person or on the floor of the conven

for the statement that Bryan will abso
lutely decline to abide by the decision of
the committee on resolutions should It be
unfavorable to his views. He has Insist
ed In a most emphatic manner that should
the conservatives hurry the committee

Implored to Quit Dictating.
Messages are now pouring 5n on him
, from friends here beseeching him to keep,
! away from Kansas City, to cease to bÂ».
dictator and to permit the convention,
which is poing to confer upon him the
great honor of renominatlon by acclama
tion, to act for the best interests of the
Democratic party.
In some quarters there is a suspicion
that much of this contention over the
platform is an Indian trick calculated to
deceive the public. It is difficult to un
derstand why Mr. Bryan should diametri
cally differ from all of his friends and ad
visers, except George Fred Williams of
Massachusetts and Democrats and Silver
Republicans from the silver States. The
men who have been on confidential terms
with him for four years are, almost with
out exception, declaring that the party. is
bound to be defeated, and more disas
trously than In 1S96, if the silver issue is
put to the front.
Bryan practically stands alone In the
position that the party must again fight
/or free silver. It Is a Quixotic charging
of windmills. Many Democrats are ready
to believe that it Is a fake fight; that the
platform will be modified to suit. the views

KANSAS CITY, July 2.â Again are
the political clouds gathering.
The storm center Is at Lincoln.
The Pikes Peak of Democracy Is
located there. Whatever storms
may arise will beat against the peak in
vain. Hill's mission has failed. He has
"nc-3rd Bryan's ultimatum, and no agree
ment has been reached. Hill and others
argued that reafflrmatlon would not be a
new feature in a Democratic political con
vention. Precedents for such action were
furnished. The convention that nominat
ed James K. Polk and George M. Dallas
in Baltimore on May 2S. 1S44, reaffirmed
the nine planks of the platform of 1S40,
and added three planks covering new Is
sues. The convention that nominated
Lewis Cass and William A. Butler at Bal
timore on May 25, 1S48, reaffirmed seven
planks of the 1S44 platform, amended an
other plank and added eleven new planks,
the outgrowth of the war with Mexico
and of new domestic issues. The conven
tion that nominated Frank Pierce and
William R. King at Baltimore on June 3,
1S32. reaffirmed nine planks of the plat
form of 1Â£4S and added eleven planks em
bodying fresh political Issues. Mr. Bryan
smiled when these precedents were quot
' ed, but stood as firm as a rock, yielding
not an inch, and insisting upon the in
sertion of a specific plank declaring anew
the ratio of 16 to 1.
Very Picturesque Scene.
David B. Hill is the only man, aside
from Bryan, who can tell what occurred
in the conference between them. The
scene must certainly have been very pic
turesque. The shrewd politician, with
faculties sharpened by years of practice
and experience, came into contact with ft
man of . adamantine character. Bryan
showed Hill the typewritten pages of his
platform. The first four resolutions cov/
rred new Issues, such as imperialism ana
trusts. Then followed a reafflrmatlon of
the Chicago platform and a specific reso
lution making free silver the issue at the
ratio of 16 to 1. It Is terse, clear and de
fiant. The arguments of the wily New
Yorker against It had no more effect; than
a cloud of "thistle; down blown against
a 'rock. All questions! of policy were bu
rled under the intense convictions -' of
Bryan.
Hill came out with drooping ' featherx.
He went straight to bed, giving r no Â¦Inti
mation of what had occurred at the in
terview. He always wears a thinking cap,
and -he needed It at* this time, more 'than
ever. He probably .wasted .very.' few hours
Friends on the Alert.
: Bryan's ; friends, are on the alert -and
they' .will ' see" to it that there will ' be no
The attitude of ; Croker is unquestioned.
Ho is an avowed and an ardent supporter
of Bryan and: will, willingly :; accept ' any
platform that comes from his hands. ,
The wiseacres thought that they could
enhance the chances of Democratic suc
cess;, by: presenting â¢ a. hermaphrodite
ticket.' There. was no popular response to
the proposal and It was undoubtedly dis
tasteful to both Bryan and Hill: Nor is
it probable that the New York delegation
will elect Hill as its representative on the
committee on resolutions. . Such selection
would give the exrGovernor an opporf
tunlty for a ' spectacular display. Jn the
convention. lie can undoubtedly secure
a hearing' on â¢ recognition from the chair
without claiming It as. a member of the
committee on resolutions. [Â¦;.:".
He gave no Indication as to what he
should do if the situation did not change.
His friends had declared that if he failed
to bring Bryan to his way of thinking he
would dc anything that Bryan wanted.
Upon arriving: at Kansas City his face
changed. It had been despondent. To
newspaper friends he laughed in a per
functory way and began telling stories
which he seemed to think were funny.
They fell upon paralyzed tympanums.
What Hill will do no man can tell. His
most intimate friends are utterly at sea.
His resources are unknown and he has
certainly reached a crisis in his new politi
cal life. Some fancy he will make trouble
in the convention and others predict Jie
will accept the ultimatum of Bryan and do
whatever he can to carry out his wishes.
How he can make trouble in the conven
tion without being selected as the repre
sentative of-the New York delegation on
the committee on resolutions it is difficult
to see.. At all evenls, he is entirely elimi
nated as a candidate for Vice ! President.
Indeed, "he never really was a candidate.
All the talk was created by political wise
acres misled by j one* of -Norman Mack's
jokes. Â¦ ;
Hill's Face Changes.
"Well," ' he replied in response Â¦ to a
question, "it isn't settled yetâ not yet. I've
got him thinking. I've got him thinking.
We shall Bee, we shall see."
In sleep. At 5 o'clock in the morning he
boarded the train on the return trip. Hill
apparently could not realize that Bryan
had rirmly made up his mind as to the
course to pursue. This was evidenced by
a remark which fell from his lips.
Delegations from Missouri, Indiana and
other States have , called upon ' Mr.' Orbker
and ; It looks as though : alliances offensive
and 'defensive were being made. Nothlnsr
Mr. Croker's face was sphinxllke at the
mention of the doctor's name. He simply
said ho had not a candidate to present
f or _ the Vice Presidency and ; should be
governed in a great measure by the wishes
of Mr. Bryan. "
Croker Is With Bryan.
The fight for the nomination for Vice
President remains unchanged. It becomes
Interesting, however, by the arrival of
Henry George Jr. and the famed Dr. John
H. Girdner of New York. Dr. Glrdner has
light complexion, gray eyes, brown hair
and the muscles of an athlete. He Is a
close friend to Bryan and is in his full
confidence. - Had the New York Democ
racy shown any disposition to put up a
fight against Bryan's nomination a con
testing delegation, would have appeared
at the National Convention headed by
John Brisben Walker, Dr. John H. Uird
ner and Henry George Jr. When visiting
New York Bryan is always a welcome
guest at Dr. Girdner's house. Indeed.
Bryan is reported to have once said that
it was the only brownstone front In the
city in which. he felt' perfectly at home.
On his arrival here this morning the.doc
tor went to the rooms of the National
Committee, where he had a close confer
ence 1 with Senator Jones of Arkansas and
ex-Governor John' T. Altgeld of Illinois.
He next visited the Midland Hotel, seek
ing an interview with Mr. Croker. An
hour afterward -It was whispered that
the doctor was seeking the nomination for
Vice President. His interview with <^lo
nel Bryan added strength to the ru%Dr.
When, questioned he would neither deny
nor affirm it. He admitted he came
straight from New York without visiting
Lincoln, but added that interesting con
versations with Mr. Bryan might be had
at any time by long distance telephone.
The Xew York delegation meets to-mor
row to select Its members on the commit
tee. Everything indicates that Hill will
be left off the programme and the member
of the new Democratic National Commit
tee will be a stanch friend of Tammany
monkeying with the platform embodying
his views and that it wilt be presented to
the convention as the genuine work of the
committee on resolutions. There will be
nothing uncertain about it. It will be
plain, direct and to the point, without the
use of words of double meaning.

Convince the Rourijon Standard-Bearer That

in a Democratic Political Convention.
BRYAN THREATENED TO
WITHDRAW FROM RACE
: Champ 'Clark,'" hailing from, the county
rendered famous by the birth of Joe Bow
ers, is a conspicuous character here. He
has just returned from a tour in the West
with Congressman -^andl3 of Indiana.
There was. a characteristic Kansas City
scene early this afternoon. The Clark del
egation from . Montana entered the city
like a delegation of conquering heroes.
There were over fifty carriages in line,
preceded by the Montana band. This' troop
of musicians is said to be Matcus Daly's
band, engaged by Senator Clark at a spe
cial rate. . The ; procession . was received
by an immense .crowd at the Midland
Hotel. Senator Clark, who was riding In
a carriage at the head. of. the line, made a
speech to the multitude, which was re
ceived with much applause and greater
curiosity. Among the listeners on the side
walk was Martin Maginnls. who is now
contesting Clark's new claim to a seat In
the United States Senate.
James Hamilton Lewis is ubiquitous. He
appears at all hotels at the same time and
is a political Cagliostrq. Exquisitely po
lite, dressed in unexceptional taste and a
paragon intellectually, he attracts atten
tion wherever he goes. Another alleged
candidate is Elliott Danforth. There ,1s a
faraway look in his eye when addressed
concerning the matter, and he attempts
witticisms betraying apparently the secret
of his aspirations. Augustus Van Wyck
attracts attention. He is lnvariaby sur
rounded by a group of Southerners, who
claim him as one of themselves". The most
confident of all aspirants, however. Is Mr.
Sulzer. Colonel Feigl, the editor of Tam
many's official crgan, and scores of hench
men are proclaiming his virtues on every
corner and housetop. Sulzer Is convinced
that the nomination lies between himself
and Towne. Singular as it may seem. Dr.
Glrdner fancies that the selection lies be
tween Towne and himself. In fact, almost
every, candidate apparently imagines him
self sure of the nomination If Mr. Towne
falls to secure It.
Montanans March In. -
definite, however, will be known until
after the meeting of the New York dele
gation to-morrow. The Pennsylvanians
are evidently annoyed at the attitude of
Mr. Croker. They seem to be steeped In
admiration of Hill and are ardently sup
porting the movement toward nominating
him lcr Vice President.
They made political speeches from tha
same platform and divided the proceeds.
Clark said he netted over $500 in the past
â¢week. "On the 8th of July," he continued,
"I shall start on a tour with Jonathan P.
Dolllver of Iowa. Dolllver takes the Re
publican end of the stick and I handle the
Democratic end. These Joint debates stir
people to the core. They flock to them
as though they were going to a circus.
Dolllver, you know. Is really the most elo-
Quent talker. He soars Into the clouds,
and I catch him by the tall feathers and
yank him back to terra firma. It's a great
show and there's lots of money in It."
BOSS CROKER PRESENTS
VIEWS OF TAMMANY
mjt ANSAS CITY, July 2.â "I wish to correct the Impression
JL*W that Tammany is fightirg: against the insertion of a sil
ver plank in the Democratic platform," said- Richard Croker to
night. "This is not so, and it is a point on which I and the
Â¦whole organization have been more misrepresented and misunder
stood than on any other. I believe and have frequently stated, that
a more conservative stand on this question would be much more to
the interests of the party, not only in New York, but all over the
country. But mark this, if it can be shown by caucuses of differ
ent State delegations and before the National Convention that it is
the belief of the majority of the party that the insertion of a 16
to 1 plank in the platform would bring more votes to the Demo
cratic ticket throughout the West, in doubtful States, and the coun
try at largs, in fact, outside of New York, than it would lose to
the party in New York, then Tammany will yield cheerfully."
HILL'S FAILURE TO CHANGE
THE ATTITUDE OF BRYAN
If the Committee on Resolutions Reports a Platform That Does" Not Contain a Specific Indorsement of
"16 to 1" the' Democratic Dictator Will Speed to Kansas City and Make a Personal

for me for my heart is true."
Platform and Vice Presidency.
All day long the platform question and
Vice Presidency have gone hand in hand.
The convention Is overwhelmingly in fa
vor of dropping free silver out of. the
back window and seems to favor taking
a candidate for Vice President frorn New
York. "Any man New York wants" is the
favorite expression heard. If the platform
( is not modified Bryan can name any can
didate he wants, and his choice, is Towne.
Shiveley .declared to the Indiana dele
gates to-day that it would be Impossible
for him to run. They took him at his
word and Shiveley's name will be
mentioned again. Of- course there is a
large number of Vice Presidential possi
bilities, but, as predicted in The Call, the
field has narrowed down to a New York
man or Charles A. Towne. Towne will,
be nominated if Bryan has his way. OC
course, there is always the possibility of
Hill's nomination by stampede. He is
still the Roosevelt of.tUÂ© convention.
Majority in Opposition.
From innermost national committee cir
cles it was learned to-night that a care
ful canvass of the delegates was com
pleted to-day. This canvass shows that
more than two-thirds of the delegates are
strongly opposed to the reiteration of the
free silver ratio of 16 to 1. They are will
ing to accept a reafflrmation. but do not
wish to go further. Moreover t far more
than a majority of the delegates assert
with much assurance that neither Mr.
Bryan nor any other man can so far dic
tate to them as to compel them to accept
a reiteration of the free silver plank. They
hope to win next November, and believe
that It cannot be done unless conservat
ism rules the committee on" resolutions.
Senator Jones, chairman of the national
committee, who is himself a firm believer
in the free coinage of silver, and who is
one of the stanchest friends of Mr.
Bryan, is convinced that the latter will
make the mistake of his life if he under
takes to force radical free silveripm upon
the convention. Senator Jones has com
municated his views to Bryan.
Towne or a New Yorker.
Late to-night there is an interesting 1 re
port in circulation, and finds many be
lievers, to the effect that Bryan has tele
phoned Chairman Jones that he is In
honor bound to stick to free silver, but
that If the convention sees fit to modify
the silver plank he can not help It, an.l
in that caee would prefer some New York
man as his running mate. However, if
the convention declares for 18 to 1 he
hopes Towne will be nominated.
The New>york delegates are confident
the convention is averse to the 16 to 1 dec
laration, and they are sharpening their
knives preparatory to a terrific fight be
tween Hill and Croker. If the personal
choice of neither Hill nor Croker 6eems
likely to be nominated, and a stampede to
Hill is in prospect Croker will undoubt
edly make a^n , appeal to Bryan to stop
the Hill boom, for Croker has been loyal
to Bryan. To-night there is a prevailing
belief that the Croker-Hill factional
strife will eliminate New York from the
contest. -It is argued that the convention
will never . stampede to Hill when It ' Is
known that Croker and powerful : Tam
many Hall have their knives out for him.
â¢Â¦ To sum up the situation, .there are Vice
Presidential booms big , and little,, with
Towne or a New York . man among
the Â¦ probabilities. The j revolt against . "16
to IV threatens Towne's once bright pros
pects, while New -York's factional differ
ences will probably eliminate that "State.

JAM FREE SILVfR DOWN

Continued From First Page,
KANSAS CITY, July 2.â The National
Democratic Committee held its first ses
sion to-day, but did little business beyond
appointing sub-committees to hear the
contests from Montana, Oklahoma, In
dian Territory and the District of Colum
bia. All these sub-committees except that
dealing with the District of Columbia con
test heard arguments to-day, some of
them reaching conclusions and others
postponing action until to-morrow.
Special attention was -given to the Mon
tana case. The members of the sub-com
mittee say no conclusion was arrived at,
-but the friends of Senator Clark claim
that a majority of the sub-committee de
clared for the seating of the delegation
bearing the Senator's name.
The District of Columbia contest will bo
heard to-morrow and all the sub-commit
tees will make the reports to the full com
mittee during the day. The committee
postponed action upon the selection of a
temporary chairman until to-morrow.
The Montana case turned upon the right
of the chairman of the State Central
Committee to fill vacancies on the com
mittee. Mr. Cockrell. a Daly man, held
the position of chairman, and attempted
to fill these vacancies. The Clark mem
bers of the committee objected to this
proceeding, and Mr. Corbett insisted that
the committee should have been allowed
to fill the vacancies. Â¦, It was upon this
point and for this reason ' Mr. Cockrell
was deposed by , committeemen> from
fourteen.;of the-, twenty-four counties of
the State. Mr. Corbett also contended
that nineteen of the twenty-four counties
of the State were represented in the Clark
convention, and that a majority of the
uncontested delegates sat in this conven.
tion. He said that no place in Butte had
been designated in which the convention
should be held, so that one place was as
regular as another.
Mr. Corbett asserted this was not a con,
test between Clark and Daly, but a con
test between the people and the copper
trust, which was attempting to control
the political affairs of the State.
Governor Smith devoted his argument
largely to showing that the practice In
the State was favorable- to permitting th\
State chairman to nil vacancies. ThU
practice had prevailed for twenty years,
and he asserted that- no objection had
been made to the appointments wherÂ»
Clark men had been selected to fill the
vacancies. The State convention was held
at a place selected by the committee hav.
ing that matter In charge and there was
no misunderstanding on this point at the
time. Governor Smith arpued at length
for recognition of the practice of the State
as the controlling factor in settling the
controversy over the tilling of vacancies
In the State committee.
The sub-committee adjourned without
reaching a final decision. It is understooo
the committee stands 2 and 2 for and
against Ciark and one undecided.
CONTESTS HEARD BY
SUB-COMMITTEES
"I am no candidate. I do not think the
convention will play any favorites. I am
in favor of nominating an. Eastern man.
and I believe one will be nominated. It
would be discourteous of me to say I
would not accept the nomination if it
were offered me. I do not think my name
will go before the convention."
CHICAGO, July 2.â Regarding the Vice
Presidential situation Mayor Harrison
made the following statement before leav
ing for Kansas City this afternoon:
Harrison Not a Candidate.
Mr. Towne profited materially during
the day through the active work of the
Nebraska delegation, which came in
wearing "Bryan and Towne" badges.
When James C. Dahlman, the next na
tional commit teeman from Nebraska and
a close friend of Mr. Bryan, was asked if
this meant that Mr. Bryan was for
Towne, he said: "I have talked with Mr.
The Danforth movement took on some
impetus when it became known that Hiil
regarded him as the best suited to go
with Bryan on a straight-out silver plat
form.
Quite independent of the Bryan influ
ence the several Vice Presidential move
ments have had varying fortunes during
the dayt Mr. Shiveley of Indiana retired
finally and imperatively, so announcing
his decision at the caucus of the Indiana
State delegation, where he was taken at
his word. The Hill movement, on the
other hand, showed decided progress, not
withstanding the chill of the Lincoln con
ference. Arriving delegations showed
marked favor, even enthusiasm, for him.
The Senator's parlors were besieged by
hundreds of delegates and callers from
Ohio. Indiana. Pennsylvania and many
other States. Among the steady stream
of callers came ex-Governor Altgeld, a
strong personal admirer of Hill, and O
H. P. Belmont and Elliott Danforth. both
of the latter being Vice Presidential pos
sibilities.
From what has developed to-day, how
ever, the mission is likely to prove ro
more productive of harmonizing results
than the pilgrimage of Hill. Indeed, this
feeling is so universal that the Eastern
delegations reached a practical determina
tion to-day to accept the inevitable and
to confine their efforts to the platform
committee, thus keeping the subject from
becoming a source of discord on the floor
of the convention.
Bryan Will Not Yield.
But the development of Mr. Bryan's
influence over the convention and his un
wavering Insistence on 10 to 1 has created
a curious counter move. This is among
the practical politicians of the party â the
Kaders who run rampaigns to secure
votes. They want no surrender of silver,
neither arc they seeking immolation at
this one altar. They seek compromise.,
concession and such a harmonizing that
all pen ions can be brought tog?ther. As
a result of this strong and growing senti
ment definite and urgent representations
have been made to Mr. Bryan in the inter
est of harmony and moderation on the
platform. The bearer of those overtures
is James K^rr. secretary of the Congres
sional National H'ommlttee. who Is with
Mr. Bryan in Lincoln to-day after con
fr-rrine with the leaders here. It is cer
tain that he reflects the strong sentiment
of his own State (Pennsylvania! and other
Eastern localities, and It is understood
that his mission has the sympatheic ap
proval if not the positive authority. of the
most influential party leaders now as-
Fembl^'i here, including practically the
entire membership of the executive com
cittee except Williams of Massachusetts.
"For the reason." as Judge Tibbetts ex

a nomination tinder the circumstances.".
repeated." said he. "not necessarily In the
same words, but in the same spirit, with
a declaration for free coinage at 16 to 1.
without regard to the action of other na
tions. Less than that would be weak
re??."
The return of Senator Hill without tan
gible result which he was willing to dis
close made it plain that his conference
with Mr. Bryan at Lincoln had come to
naught and "it served also to emphasize
the general feeling that. Mr. Bryan would
not tolerate anv temporizing on the plat
form. The Senator came hack from Lin
coln on the car with the Nebraska dele
gation, mingled with them and exchanged
views. But there was no evidence of the
slightest sympathy among them for him
as the companion of Bryan on the ticket.

Ros% for Temporary Chairman.
The great v.ork of the convention began
to-day with a meeting of the National
Committee to determine contests and to
select temporary officers. Mayor Rose
of Milwaukee, the choico for temporary
ohrirman. is a German-American, re
pute'd to be an orator of fine presence ana
effective delivery. To-night the National
Committee had a private dinnerâ a pert of
family conference, as thÂ«j giust of Dan

The Monetary League also began iis ses
sions to-day, with "Coin" Harvey and Mr.
Tnwne as attractions; but this was quite
too academic to attract much attention.
'. gut. aFide from these formal proceed
ings, the day has brought many develop
ments: and pome surprises in the general
situation. The dominating influence of
Mr Bryan over the convention has been
rnade manifest, causing some concern and
.'list a little rebellion in some quarters.
It U not by any authoritative or formal
â¢word* or actions by him that this influ
ence is exerte.3. but in ways none the lep?
effective. Its importance, however, has
not beÂ«ii fo much in dkclnÂ«ing how strong
e hand Mr. Bryan hold? on the convention
course as in showing that there is little
likelihood of a modification or dilution of
lh<= silver plank. , .
Tho arrival of the Nebraska delegation,
fresh from conference with the leader,
â¢was mainly instrumental in showing Mr.
Bryan's attitude. They were hardly off
tr"Â» cars before they met in caucus and
formally put forward a declaration of
prir^lplep. This expressed unalterable
opposition to any Furrendcr of the prin
ciple of bimetallism, and a demand fnr a
fina.i^al plank making a specific pledge
for the fref and unlimited coinage of gold
end silver at the ratio of 16 to 1. independ
ently of what any other nation may do.
TOWNE'S FRIENDS ACTIVE.
Minnesota Delegation Urged to Hurry
to Kansas City.
ST. PAUL. July 2.â The State delegates
to the Kansas City convention to-day re
ceived a message from Messrs Rosing and
Roxboro, who are at Kansas City, indi
cating that there i3 warm work before tha
Minnesota delegation, presumably in the
interests of Mr. Towne's candidacy. Mr.
Rosing wired for the delegation to be
called together immediately and notified
it to come by the first train, as it was
vitally important tr> be on the ground on
Wednesday. Mr. I,ane, secretary of the
State Central Committee, wired the dele
gates to come to St. Paul and start im
mediately. They went out this evening
by the regular Great Western train.
At Democratic headquarters this move
from Kansas City is deemed encouraging
to the interests of Minnesota's candidate
for Vice President. Mr. Towne.
The special train engaged by the Silver
Republicans will leave to-morrow after
noon.
It is yet anybody's fight and the pro
prietors of the Vice Presidential "boom
lets" are picking up courage.
Bryan recently and I think his attitude
could be summed up in about this way:
He is not favoring any one candidate. He
wants us not to make our wishes too
prominent, as it wiir look as though this
reflected his views, whereas he wants to
keep entirely out of the Vice Presidential
contest. But we feel that we should ex
press our views for Towne, who is a fa
vorite with most of tho delegation and our
work will be for him."
When Mr. Dahlman was further asked
if Mr. Bryan opposed any particular man
because of his financial views, he said:
"There is no opposition by name. But
Mr. Bry/in wants a man who can stand
with him. firmly and fully, on the 16 to 1
platform, for that is what the platform
will he. Without discussing individuals.
I think it can be put down that no man
out of sympathy with such a platform
will be nominated for Vice President. The
platform is more to Mr. Bryan than Vice
Presidential candidates."
Bryan to Address the Convention.
Mr. Dahlman also gave definite assur
ance of a dramatic climax to the nomi
nation of Mr. Bryan by his appearance on
the floor of the convention for a speech
that will electrify the convention and
serve as a campaign keynote.
"We are going to insist on his coming
down and appearing before the conven
tion," said Mr. Dahlman. "The Nebraska
men will see that a resolution is passed
inviting him hero, and you may rest as.
sured he will come, although he is person
ally disinclined to do so."
the strongest men In tha Democratic
party.
At a late hour to-night an interesting re
port was put into circulation to the effect
that White had really been informed by
Hill's friends that Hill would accept it
nominated for Vice President. It appears
probable that the California delegation
will support Hill until his candidacy ap
pears hopeless. New York might then re
turn California's compliment and cast sev
enty-two votes for White. This la only
one of the many items of gossip floating
about the hotel corridors to-nfght. White's
arrival is awaited with interest by the
Californians.
A committee appointed by the Monetary
League has prepared an address to the
American people and will submit it to a
meeting of the league to-morrow. The
address opens with a long dissertation on
the monev question and the so-called In
dustrial evils. To the formation of the so
called money trust, made possible by >( the
retirement of silver as "real money. Is
attributed the subsequent formation of
numerous industrial trusts and their con
sequent evils.
Combinations known as labor unions,
the address says, are also an outgrowth or
combinations of capital. The existence of
these labor unions is proof in itself that
wages would decline If not maintained by
combinations to that end. While a scale
may be thus maintained the loss on the
whole to labor is as much as if the decline
in wages had occurred, as time is lost in.
idlesness, lockouts, strikes and in assess
ments on laborers to maintain their
unions. In conclusion it says:
In this crisis now threatening civilization
throughout the world it Is but natural that the
highest order of intelligence should be dis
played here In this free republic and that the
United States should lead in the overthrow of
the threatened danger. For an immediate
remedy, our choice lies between two political
parties, whnse candidates for President and
Congress are now being presented to the peo
ple. The Republican party has recently met
at Philadelphia In national convention and in
its platform, to the chagrin and discourage
ment of millions of honest members of that
party, has approved of the" iniquitous laws
passed In the interests of organized money
lenders and of which we complain. The other,
or Democratic party, is now about to assem
ble iu.thls city In national convention, and in
it our hopes now lie for intelligent and cour
ageous action. Should it take a position on
these questions that become free and enlight
ened people, we will bid It KOdspeeJ in its
work of progress, emancipation and civiliza
tion.
CALIFORNIANS AT
CONVENTION CITY
Harassed bg the Fear That Theu
Mag Have to Vote for â¢
Hearst,
Special r>t?i>atch to The Call.
KANSAS CITY. July 2.â It was nearly
8 o'clock when the Santa Fe train haul
ing the California delegates to the con
vention steamed into Union Depot. The
station was crowded, but as the Califor
nians were unaccompanied by any brass
band and were too tired to make any
noise, their entry was quiet enough.
There was no demonstration of any kind;
they did not parade to their headquarters
behind music and with flying banners
like their Republican brethren at Phila
delphia, but were content to ride in a
street car and. in accord with Judge Ma
gulre's ideas of Jeffersonian simplicity.
Judge Maguire and M. F. Tarpey were
attired in negligee shirts and the entire
party was saflly begrimed with smoke and
dust. After inspecting their headquarters
at the Coates House they dispersed to
their individual quarters at the various
hotels, most of them stopping at the
Coates, the Victoria and the Washington.
They will hold a meeting in their head
quarters, parlor J of the Coatea House,
to-morrow morning at 0 o'clock, after
Senator White arrives, when the Vice
Presidency will be discussed and mem
bers of the various committees selected.
The Californians say they had a fairly
pleasant trip and managed to have some
fun en route. At Pueblo they attended a
circus. Mr. Sweet of Santa Rosa com
posed a song, set to the music of "There'll
Be a Hot Time in the Old Town To
night." Each delegate, offered criticisms
and amendments and the song was a won
der when each Californian had contributed
his quota.
To-morrow the exhibit of California
fruits and wines will be opened in the
lobby of the Coates House.
While it is true that nothing will be de
cided upon with respect to the Vire Presi
dency until the arrival of Senator White,
there is pood reason to believe that the
Californians fear they may have to vote
for Mr. Hearst's choice for Vice Presi
dent. There was a suspicion lurking
about the Coates Hotel lobby late to
night that Mr. Hearst had not entirely
abandoned his ambition to receive Cali
fornia's complimentary vote, notwith
standing the way he was turned down
by the committee at Sacramento. The
California delegation apprehends that the
young man Is yet ambitious. The Â¦word
"apprehension" is used advisedly, for "ap
prehension" is the very word to express
the feeling of thÂ» delegates individually
and collectively. They realize they would
cut a sorry figure in espousing the Vice
Presidential boom of the Yellow Kid's ed
itor, but are afraid of his lash.
The Call correspondent has known for
a long time that Judge Magulre has
greatly admired his former colleague in
Congress. Charles A. Towne of Minne
sota. Towne is a Populist, and Judge Ma
giiire is the next thing to it. It was sur
prising, therefore, to-night when Mr. Jla
gulre expressed a doubt that Towne's geo
graphical location might not militate
against him. The Judge said:
"Mr. Towne is an able man. I believe
firmly in free, coinage, too. but Towne's
fesidence Is only 150 miles from that of,
Bryan. Would it not be better to nomi
nate a candidate from a more distant sec
tion of tho country?"
Just what was passing in his mind was
not apparent to the newspaper men. but
they were good guessers and surmised
that Hearst will either pose as a candidate
himself or else, realizing the absurdity of
his own candidacy, will bring influence to
bear on the Californians to induce them
to votfi for Hill tn order to defeat Croker
and Van Wyck and the Tammany crowd
The New York Journal, as Is known, has
been waging a fight against the ice trust,
which is fostered by Croker. the Van
Wyck brothers and Tammany chiefs tn
general. The latter have angered Hearst
by making unpleasant allusions to "Yel
low.Kid Journalism." and it is a ten-to
one shot that the young man will attempt
to array the California delegation against
Croker and in favor of Hill. Judge Ma
guire's uncalled for eulogy of Hill would
seem to indicate that Hill Is Hearst's
choice for Vice President.
Hearst's .candidacy is a manifest ab
surdity to everybody in Kansas City. If
"California were to seriously present the
name of. any Californian for the Vice
Presidency . it would be that of Senator
Â¦White, who presided over the convention
that nominated Bryan four years ago.
/White stands very well with Bryan and is,
furthermore, generally regarded as one of
WILL PLACE BRYAN IN NOMINATION.
According to the programme of the Democratic National Convention, Willis D. Oldham will make the speech
nominating Bryan for the Presidency, and Senator White will make an able seconding speech.
KANSAS CITY, July 2.â The placid
ity of the meeting of the United
States Monetary League was con
siderably ruffled fn the closing
hours to-day by statements from
General A. J. Warner of Ohio, who was
a volunteer speaker, taking tho time
and place which had been assigned to
Mr. Sulzer of New York, who failed to
appear. General Warner was introduced
by ex-Governor St. John, who called him
the "father of the cause of free silver."
General Warner caused the first flutter
of excitement by saying that so far as he
knew there was no proposition to change
the ratio of coinage. 'The live question of
the hour, he added, was to get silver re
stored, to its former place, where it wouid
have the same rights as gold.
"I don't care anything about the ratio
of 16 to 1," he said. "Get silver restored;
catch your hare first, then cook it. Regu
late silver automatically and you settle
the question. I sometimes think we have
laid too much stress on 1G to 1. I am in
favor of it, but there are and must al
ways be conditions which may change the
ratio."
Mr. Berry of Pennsylvania interrupted
and asked if General Warner was not
giving away some of the secrets of the
platform. Before General Warner could
reply Mr. Harvey asked him:
"Do you understand the history of free
coinage?"
General Warner replied without perturb
ation that he had made a study of it, and
he begged leave to say to Mr. Harvey and
others that there had been no legal action
taken by Congress on the question of
ratio. General St. John followed with an
interruption in which he said:
"I say â¢ to General Warner that unless
16 to 1 is specifically mentioned in the
platform of the convention to meet this
week, a tremor will run along the entire
line and voters in the West, especially,
would desert the ticket by thousands."
Delegates Become Angry.
This statement received vigorous ap
plause. Turning to those in front. Gen
eral Warner said:
"Get your silver first. Don't make any
more mistakes. When you get your silver
we. will fix the ratio."
Interruptions followed with rapidity
and exceptions to the? speaker's views be
came heated. Waiting a . moment for
quiet. General Warner continued:
"I tell you the question of 16 to.l is go
ing to cut little figure in this campaign.
The issues will be anti-imnerialism and
trusts and what we should do for human
ity, and the question of ratio will sink
into infinite insigniticance."
An excited speaker in the rear row
shouted that if General Warner's ideas
prevailed the party might as well tear
down the flag of the campaign and the
election of McKinley would be Inevitable.
General Warner said he would not take
up further time. * Mr. Harvey leaped upon
a table, and, repeating former statements,
he added:
'. "If the people do not instruct Congre/33
before election on the question of ratio
Congress would never agree. .And I stand
here, to sky to you," pointing to General
Warner, "16 to 1 has been demanded by
our leader. Colonel Bryan, and we will
follow his lead."
H. A. Elian of Buffalo. N. Y., was called
and said -New York Democracy had come
to Kansas City to demand that 16 to 1 be
specifically mentioned, and nothing else
would satisfy New York.
A motion made to add General Warner
to the committee on resolutions brought
out several objections, and General War
ner settled the problem by refusing to
serve.
A vote asking General Warner .to ad
dress the convention to-morrow at 10 a.
m.. on the currency bill was unanimously
passed and the convention adjourned un
til that hour. ,
Warner Roundly Denounced.
After the convention General Warner
was waylaid at the entrance by many
who had been present and some of them
denounced him politically, and, in some
instances, personally. The outside pro
test was as vigorous as that of the in
side. ,.
Ex-Governor St. John was the first
speaker of the afternoon session. His sub
ject being "What Constitutes Money?"
Referring to the convention on the fourth,
the speaker hoped that there would be a
new declaration of principles. He de
manded that the free coinage of silver at
16 to 1 should be emphasized by the con
vention and nothing short of such an
enunciation would suit the people.
J. R. Sovereign of Arkansas spoke on
"Monetary Reform." The best money
this country ever had. said the speaker,
was the sort that did not want to go
awav from home." /
W. K. Berry of Chester. Pa., spoke on
"Freedom for the Workingmen. This
was to be the slogan of 1900, he said. Mr.
Berry compared Mr. Bryan to Moses, as
a leader.

wlll derive benefits from the Oriental
trade which are now hardly dreamed of
by most people. We will become one of
the greatest commercial nations. We are
in a nositlon to take our full share of any
benefits which may result by changes in
China and to assert our rights touching
that nation. Wars will be inevitable un- 1
til civilization is re-established on a high
er plane, and in the meantime we must
keep sten with the march of event3 and
assume our share of responsibilities,
whether in China or elsewhere.
T. C. VAN NESS â
I favor the legitimate expansion of the
Influence and interests of this country.
I believe that a, point has been reached
when our commercial necessities de
mand that we s'hould take an interest
in the affairs of the world, and should act
in Concert with the other great powers in
so far as the protection of American com
merce may require. I am not, however,
in sympathy with that form of expansion
which consists in the absorption by force
of the Philippines. Cuba and other coun
tries foreign to us in language, religion
and thougnt. I do not think that our
form of government is such as to permit
the successful control of foreign colonies,
and it Is, to my mind, not in harmony
with the theory of our constitution to
force our government upon an unwilling
foreign people.
In my opinion the right of this country
to oppose by force. If necessary, any
action on this continent of any European
or other government inimical to our in
terests has always existed, independently
of the so-called Monroe doctrine; but that
the declaration of President Monroe, In
so far as it goes beyond the announce
ment of this principle, however appro
priate at the time It was made, has no
useful application now. It might well be
that In a dispute between a European
power and one of the South American re
pullcs, for instance, the former might be
wholly In the right and the latter wholly
In the wrong, and that the enforcement
of the former's right, even to the extent
of Invading and holding the territory of
the latter would operate to our advantage
rather than our disadvantage. In such
a case I can see no sense or reason In
Interference upon our part in favor of
the wrong doer and against our own In
terests merely because the European
power might acquire a foothold upon this
continent. The day has gone by when we
need have any fear of 111 results to our
selves from such an occupation. I am
also Inclined to think that the time is not
far distant when we will all have a realiz
ing sense that America cannot whip the
whole world, and that If a combination
sufficiently strong be made In opposition
to the enforcement of the Monroe doctrine
we will find reason to gracefully retire
from our Inslstance thereon.
I do not consider that- our Government
had the right to acquire sovereignty to
any of the foreign territories In which we
are now exercising control against the
will of the inhabitants thereof, and that
It has as little right to sell that sovereign
ty to another. How other governments
might look upon such action I am unable
.to say. I also think that if our govern
ment is not wanted In- the Philippines.
Cuba and Porto Rico we ought to get out
of those countries as soon as we honorably
can.
JOSEPH LEGGETTâ
I am opposed to expansion and I. would
adhere strictly to the provisions of the
Monroe doctrine.
The annexation of Hawaii was Justifi
able, for its government was tottering and
if we had not taken It some other power
would have done so, and annexation of
the Islands was justified by their stra
tegic position in regard to our Western
coast. But as for the Philippines, I be
lieve it would have saved us millions of

I -we were about to do such a thing. But
we are in it. and I see no better way out
of it than to establish some form of self
government for the Philippines. Anyway,
we should get out of it In some manner.
About that twenty millions, it seems
hardly fair to make the Filipinos pay it
and it seems unjust to make .the
people of this country pay it
without recompense. Perhaps some way
could be found to have it paid in install
ments from the revenue of the Islands. I
think we should attend to our own busi
ness and the other powers will think all
the more of us. If they do not It should
make no difference.
As to my views of expansion. I think the>
territory embraced within the continental
limits of the United States Is abundantly
capable of supporting In comfort at least
one hundred times Its population. "We
have Indeed a goodly heritage â the best

his own on this planet. The Creator has

HENRY ACHâ
I favor expansion to the extent that we
were compelled to expand by reason of
the Spanish-American, war. I am what
might be called a rabid annexation^,
referring to all territory bounding this
continent. In other words, I believe the
Government of the United States should
acquire by purchase, whenever pos
sible, all our northern boundary. In
my opinion the United States should
adhere more strongly than ever to the
provisions of the Monroe doctrine In
answer to the third question. I believe
that the acquisition of the Islands must
of necessity prove beneficial to the United
States at large, and I believe that the
islands of the Pacific will ultimately be
the cause of an Immense development of
the Pacific Slope. I do not deem It advis
able to withdraw our troops from our
new possessions, nor do I believe in the
sale of any productive or profitable terri
tory. The decrease of the army will res
ulate itself as soon as the natives of the
Philippines understand the policy of the
Government.
E. F. PBESTONâ
I do not favor expansion and I belleva
we should adhere to the provisions of the
Monroe doctrine, but I think the acquisi
tion of Cuba, Porto Rico and the other
West India isles comes well within the
purview of the Monroe doctrine, as lead
ing statesmen of all parties have regarded
their possession, by foreign powers as a
menace to the Atlantic coast, and the ac
quisition of the West Indies baa been rec
ommended by a long series of Secretaries
of State. It Is only their strategic position
in regard to the Atlantic seaboard which
in my opinion Justifies their retention. So
far as Hawaii, the Ladrones and the Phil
ippine isles are concerned. I do Dot believe
they can be so assimilate'! as to form an
Integral part of the United States; and
even if such assimilation were successful
I believe It would be, Injurious In the high
est degree to the intellectual stamina of

quered provinces to the people of which it
has denied the right of .self-government
and those other advantages of political
liberty which we consider our rights by

talking- about "Providence having carried
the flag to distant climes," they see in
this territorial expansion greater oppor
tunities for developing mission work
where it has been begun, and opportuni
ties for beginning It in fields as yet unde
veloped. Without taking Into considera
tion China's right as a nation to national
existence, without apparently considering
the moral right of the United States to
seize foreign territory, many ministers
were found who expressed moral hopes
that the present difficulties In China would
result in the United States getting a share
of that great empire.
Opposed by Lawyers.
Lawyers in nearly all the cities were
for the most part opposed to expansion,
regarding expansion without the adoption
of an imperialistic policy as an impossi
bility. "The greatest national mistake
ever made," one well informed lawyer
Put it. Lawyers argue that it Is con
trary to the traditions of the country, that
it Is impossible to extend a republican
form of government to unenlightened peo
ple, that an imperial colonial government
and republican home government are an
absurdity. Many of them foresee in the
policy of expansion, as now being pursued
by the administration, the ultimate down
fall of the republic.
Merchants Almost Unanimous.
Among business men it may be said that
the sentiment of large merchants In the
large cities is aimost unanimous for ex
pansion, while the small tradesmen as a
rule are anti-expansionists. The manu
facturers see in the possession of new ter
ritory the possibility of new markets, ex
tension of trade, development of com
merce, a remedy for that bugaboo of busi
ness, overproduction. In Southern cities
however, even the sugaj- planters and su
gar dealers of Louisiana fear that the
sugar Industry In the United States would
be imperiled by the accession of tropical
territory elsewhere. Then among business
men. accustomed to count the cost of ven
tures before making them, the cost of ex

cible argument against it.

XEW YORK, July 2.â What is practically a poll
of the people of the United States on the question of
expansion and imperialism is herewith- presented.
Through their correspondents in fifteen leading cities
of the United States the Herald and The Call have inter
views with five distinctive classes of representative voters
â business men. lawyers, physicians, clergymen and labor
ing men. The result shows that
Business men seem to favor expansion.
Physicians favor expansion.
Clergymen, excepting Roman Catholics, who are non
committal, favor expansion.
Lawyers oppose expansion.
Laboring men almost unanimously oppose expansion.
A slight majority of the whole number of persons in
terviewed are opposed to expansion and imperialism as il
lustrated by the McKinley administration.
A fair proportion, realizing the gravity of the question,
have as yet come to no decisive opinion. Every effort has
been made to have the poll in every respect unbiased.
The politics of men interviewed have been left entirely
out of the question, for it was realized that there are many
Republicans who do not by any means agree with the Mc-
Kinley policy and many Democrats who approve of the
retention of the Philippines.
It was found that as a class lawyers, accustomed to
delving deep into questions before drawing conclusions,
were opponents of expansion. The labor interest, too. in
many cities was found to be a unit against the imperialistic
course of the administration.
Of the friends of expansion, a majority are found
among business men, clergymen and physicians, but in no
case, except that of the labor class, is the dividing line drawn
sharply and distinctly.
The interviews were obtained in the following fifteen
cities: Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Denver. Gal

POLL OF THE UNITED STATES ON THE ALL-ABSORBING
QUESTION OF EXPANSION,
important strategic points for national
defense, I am In -favor of expansion. ' â¢
.Some of the richest and most important
territory within our national domain and
the most loyal States' of the American
Union have been added to the republic
by a process of legitimate expansion.
But if expansion means the introduction
into our form of government of a system
of imperialism or militarismâ if It involves
the government of subject races by force
and by means of standing armies in spite
of and against the protest of the people
governed â then I am unalterably opposed
to expansion.
:It will be a sad day for the republic
when the maintenance of order within any
recognized portion "of, this domain calls
for the permanent employment of a large
standing army of hundreds of thousands
of soldiers. The phenomenal -. success of
our country in. the mechanical and lndus-
a' large standing army Is-a menace to the
future of the republic.
â¢ Roman Imperialism divided the world
into. master and slave. Like causes pro
duce like effects.' Â¦ Â¦
â¢The future of our republic is in dan
ger when we resort to the, methods. that
disintegrated the Roman empire.
I am In favor of retaining Porto Rico
and Hawaii -as parts of our national do
main and giving to the inhabitants all the
rights accorded to American citizens by
our constitution. , ~
$ Where our flag floats the guarantees of
our constitution should be Inviolate.
As to the Philippines. I think that the
best policy of our Government would be
to retain a. few important points for na
val stations to preserve order long enough,
as in the'case of Cuba, and "-to -turn over
the islands In a state of peace to. native
I think it also our duty to guarantee
the Filipinos against foreign ; invasion. ?
As to the Monroe doctrine,' there is
not nine, in my judgment, in our recent
I have faith that our recent acquisitions
will be a benefit, though we have much
to reform in the conduct of our own Gov
ernment before we set up as a model for
the rest of the world. Cuba Is ; not In
cluded In this answer, because I do not
understand It to be an acquisition of the
United States, although' drawn into very
close relations with us. Porto Rico was
acquired- for military purposes and under
the administration of President Grant it
was not considered a violation of any na
tional * traditions - or doctrines to obtain
an island : in the West Indies in further
ance of our military requirements. We
have done the same thing: In Samoa.
I do not consider It advisable or becom
ine for this nation to retire from any of
ly to countries upon the American conti
nent. It was enforced not long ago In
South America. There Is no occasion to
Ignore It or to assume that It has been
Ignored. That doctrine has no application
to our acquisition of the Philippines, as
the incident of a war declared and waged
for another purpose.
SOME OF THE LOCAL CITIZENS WHO GAVE THEIR OPINIONS.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JULY 3, 1900.
3It is a matter of the greatest import
that the Hawaiian Islands should be
owned by this country. The troops should
not be withdrawn from the Philippines :iÂ»
It would lower the standing Of this coun
try in the eyes of other nations. They
will require a much longer time to enable
the United States to discover the proper
mode of treatment or jjovernment.
DR. G. F. SHIELSâ
Under circumstances existing previous
to the declaration of war with Spain.
I was entirely against expansion. Subse
quent to the war I am of the belief that
this nation cannot with dignity or pro
priety recede from the territory it has
acquired. I can in no way conceive that
such possession should be an indication
for further territorial expansion. As a
logical result : of tho war with Spain the
Monroe doctrine must t;e waived, "so far
as this territory Is concerned. But on the
other hand it should bo strictly upheld
in to far as it protects us against a ten
dency toward unnecessary and deleterious
Interference with conditions entirely for
eign to our geographical, political and so
ojal statf. Jf it can be done with secur
ity and the conviction that the purchaser
Will deal honestly, fairly and uprightly
with the people of these possessions, sell
them. An entirely erroneous policy is that
of expansion partially brought upon us
by circumstances over which we could
have no control, and Involving a question
of moral responsibility which we cannot
with fairness or dignity overlook.
DR. G. E. STJSSDORFFâ
I am a firm believer in expansion, but
not that sort which should be properly
designated as imperialism. The Monroe
doctrine should bo adhered to, provided
it aids us in protecting our own inter
ests, and enables us to avoid alliances or
complications with foreign powers.
Commercially speaking, the acquisition
of these countries will prove of benefit,
but 1 am nrmly opposed to any measure
that will open tho gates of this country,
allowing the natives of these countries ac
cess to the field of labor.
I do not favor the withdrawal of our
troops from these possessions until such
time as the inhabitants are able to pro
vide capable government for themselves/
Lntil such time it is our duty to provide
them every protection, as by our inter
ference we have given them every right to
expect.
DR. W. N. SULLIVANâ
I do not favor the policy of expansion,
so far as the acquisition of extensive ter
ritory in foreign parts is concerned, but
as in^the case of the Islands of Hawaii
and the Island of Guam, which- give this
country a iirm basis for the action of its
navy, I must say expansion seems favor
able.
The Monroe doctrine should be adhered
to. We have not in our late war with
Spain violated any of its principles, as
some may say. Our late trouble was not
of our own seeking, but merely the out
come of years of persecution, culminat
ing in a war, not for gain, but for the
sake of humanity. Having acquired these
possessions, I deem it the duty of this
country to hold them. The presence of
troops will be an absolute necessity for
some time to come, but 1 think, when the.
natives are under control the islands will
prove a source of great value. It is not
necessary for us to carry the policy of
expansion to any greater extent. We have
enough internal resources to main
tain us always. In favorable relation with
the powers of the world, and having sat
isfied the claims made on' us for human
ity's sake, put a stop to the acquisition
of territory that must in the future prove
but a source of trouble.
DR. G. C. MACDONALDâ
Expansion in my opinion is but a nat
ural fulfillment of the law of evolution,
and is unavoidable. With the war with
Spain in view, it does not. seem possible
for the United States to adhere to the Mon
roe doctrine. We must be- prepared to give
and take. It is not advisable for this
country . to withdraw its troops. It
would be manifestly unjust to our army
and to the people who. have given their
lives, and those who have furnished funds
through taxation, to acquire these new
territories. To dispose of the newly ac
quired properties by sale would be a re-t
turn to the principles of slavery, and "a
blow, 'to' the commercial interests of tha
United States and as such cannot be done
without loss of prestige to this country.
. We arc 'so dominated by politics in this
country that a settled line of action, such
as called for by 1 the policy of expansion,
Is almost an impossibility.
DR. H. P. MAAS
Â¦ I am not in favor of expansion for the
reason that such policy would require an
immense standing army and a correspond
ing increase of expense, and with the ex
ception of a few, of no gain to the peo
ple. '
We should a'dhere strictly to the prin
ciples of the Monroe doctrine. In the
past it has been looked on as nure Amer
icanism and should- still be, held as such.
These islands possibly with the exception
of the Hawaiian group will be of no ben
efit to us. The natives are not what we
would care to call Americans, and under
these : circumstances, - the withdrawal of
troops can be accomplished without loss
of prestige. ; Having given them their lib
erty we should not try to restrict' them
In its , performance.
We can make a commercial treaty thai
will bring back to the coffers of Uncle
Sam all that this has cost him. The pol
icy of expansion is an erroneous one. We
have tried It and find the only benefit has
been a small increase in commercial in
terests, the war tax on the ponple of this
country, to my idea, being more than
enough to offset It.
" ~~A D ROSENBERCf, pecretary of the
HSan Francisco Labor Councilâ I am
opposed to expansion as now car
j ried out by the Government. Un
less the United States gives a free
and Independent government to the Cu
bans and Filipinos the Monroe doctrine,
this guarantee against the aggression of
Kuropean powers against the peoples of
the American continent, will logically and
Inevitably be ignore'd, for it is becoming
ridiculous. The recent acquisitions of ter
ritory by the United States are detrimental
to the people of the United States by In
troducing cheap labor to break down the
present standard of American labor. Our
troops should be withdrawn from the new
possessions and their peoples given their
independence, with the principle of the
Monroe doctrine applied to them. It would
be fair to the natives and raise us high In
the opinion of all liberty-loving people.
Unlimited expansion under existing indus
trial conditions is an insurmountable
stumbling block toward real progress of
the people.
WALTEH MacARTHTTRâ
(Late Editor of Coast Seamen's Journal.)
I am opposed tb the extension of terri
tory outelde of our present continent, but
would favor extending the American flag
into territory contiguous to our republic;
for instance, extension Into Canada or into
Latin America would be advantageous,
not only to us. but tn tho people who
would come under our flag.
1 believe in the Monroe doctrine. It is If
anything more essential now since the
war with Spain.
The acquisition of Cuba. Porto Rico,
etc.. will "prove a detriment to the coun
tries, progressively, morally, industrially
and politically.
1 believe that the United States forces
should be withdrawn from all of the ter
ritories and the same should be placed un
der the management and full control of
the Inhabitants thereof; subject, however,
to a mutual guarantee from the Govern
ment of the I'nited States in accordance
with the best interests of both parties. I
think that such action would be but fair
to the natives and would be highly advan
tageous Â¦ to this Government. It would
fully vindicate our claim that all govern
ments derive their just power by the con
pent of those governed.
lly personal policy of expansion is that
aggrandisement advanced and favored by
the few is not for the benefit of the many.
GUY LATHROPâ
(Manager of the San Francisco I,abor Bu-
I do not favor expansion. I think
it will be against the best inter
ests of the people in general, while it may
benefit the few. Our troops should not be
withdrawn until a secure form of govern
ment shall have bcea established for the
inhabitants by which and under which
they may live and enjoy their freedom
without beingr subject to spoliation from
other and less liberal Governments than
ours. Expansion nt home on our own

wrong when you cross the ocean.
A. DIJEAT7â
(Chairman of the executive committee of
San Francisco Labor Council.)
No, I do not favor ' expansion. The
Monroe doctrine should, be adhered to. It
is more imperative on us now than it was
before the war.
The acquisition of territory Is a detri
ment to this country. It will injure every
workman's interest to have to compete
with men who do not know what it J3
to bo free laborers.
The question of the withdrawal of the
troops Is uncertain and can only be solved
by time and circumstances.
W. E. LANE^
(Master Plumber.)
Yes; yes; I am for expansion. As to
tho acquisition of our new territories. No
better proof can be advanced than the
wonderful prosperity of the United States,

All people have right to life, liberty

REV. PHILIP COOMBE â
(Richmond Congregational Church.>
I am in favor of expansion for various
reasons, but principally because our Gov
ernment has been" led Into that direction
through the desire of the people to relieve
oppressed neighbors and because I believe
this nation will become more and more
the good Samaritan to the downtrodden
and degraded of the earth. This policy
can be sustained without the abrogation
of the Monroe doctrine.
I think the acquisition of our new pop
sessions will benefit our nation as surely
as the undertaking of any new responsi
bilities by an individual is beneficial to
him bv increasing his powers and devel
oping "his character. As It has already
been of value to us commercially and In
the present crisis in China by enabling
us to afford quick relief to our own coun
trvmen when in imminent danger there.
To withdraw military and naval protec
tion from a people whose welfare has been
placed In our care, who are incapable of
self-government or self-defense, to leave
those who are peaceably disposed as a
prey to the corrupt and lawless among
themselves, would be a criminal neglect
of duty It would be unfair to a large ma
jority among the natives who desire the
good government which America will give
to them and which they may ultimately
exercise for themselves.
It would make all the nations think that
we are weak and unfitted to occupy the
place which is ours by providential over
ruling, wise statesmanship, loyal citizen
ship, bravely borne flag 1 and blood-bought
purchase. I believe that expansion as an
American policy will help to produce uni
versal respect for the best civilization
the world has ever yet manifested, respect
for the majesty of law and the divinity of
justice and desire for the reign of univer
sal and permanent peace. The time is
coming when pome of the nations of the
earth will co-operate to secure peace on
earth, good will among men, equal rights
for all races of men and classes of society,
and America will take her place as one
of the foremost in bringing to the world
this golden age for which we nre all
longingâ which is already dawning.
DR. S. TRASKâ I don't believe it is
particularly the duty of the United
States to attempt the reformation
of the world or its uncivilised peo
ple. Naturally trade facilities are
benefited to a great extent by these ac
quisitions, but as the United States al
ready possesses more than enough, of
these heterogeneous elements to make a

great danger. ' â¢ .

I am unalterably opposed to expansion,

in reference to- free trade should teach us
that the acquisition of- Hawaii, the La

of more. We should leave outsiders alone.

DR. A. P. O'JBRIENâ
I am a firm believer in the Monroe doc
trine, and don't believe that conditions

belief that the acquisition of Hawaii was
due to a voluntary move on the part of
the people. These Hawaiian Islands and
the Island of Guam of the Ladrones are
certainly a source of strength to the
United States, from a strategic point of
view. The people of Cuba, Porto Rico and
the Philippines are of that class that will
not assimilate with us. being imbued with
the solrtit of revolution, and, while there
may be some trade advantages, 1 con
sider their disposal will prove of benefit.

I am d*>cide<iiy in favor of expansion.
The Monroe dictrfne should not be allowed
to interfere with the progress and develop
ment of civilization and commerce. The
more markets the more prosperity; the
more strategic possessions the greater se
curity 1 think it obligatory on the United
States to establish in all its new posses
sions civil prnverr.ments. and cs speedily as
possible v> introduce our American school
ETEtem. They should all be developed on
tiii> pjime lines as Territories and given
the same privileges, with the exception </f
Cuba, which should he a republic under
the protection cf the United States. Only
such troops should be maintained as
would guarantee security of life and prop
erty. We are not real estate dealers, so
should not sHl our lands to other na
tions, r.nr for the matter of that should
wo grant them coaling or telegraph sta
tirns on or near them, even thouph they
might offer us West India island3 in re
turn. Handing over our new possessions
to others would certainly not tend to reas
sure the natives or put them in that
peaceful frame of mind so essentially
no-oo^ary to their discontinuing target
practice and directing their attention and
to the development of commerce
and industry. In the eyes of the nations,
abandoning these people would certainly j
rnran that we had overestimated ourselves
and were proclaiming our incomp^tenoy
and our impotence to carry out our self
imposrd task.
In regard io expansion. I do not fop how
it can be proventM. History and common
per.se demonstrate that modern Civiliza
tion must Inevitably displace the old. The
conflict of West against East begins as
poon as new markets are opened up in the
Orient. It is only a question of time when
th<- now will supplant the old. It has hap
lÂ»e-iicd before, it is happening now and it
will continue to occur so long as this
world exists, and no announcement of
principle made at any time or by any one
ran alt^r th<Â» law of the universe, not even
the Czar and his "peace proclamation."
REV. E. NELANDERâ
(First English Lutheran.)
A national policy of territorial expan
sion usually means the conquest of weak
er nations in order to satisfy the lust of
power. Then it is that the strong wax
fat on the carcass of the weak. Then
might makes right. Vae victis! Thus it
is that the weaker nations are from time
to time disappearing from the map. The
Republic of Transvaal and the Empire of
China are at the present time setting
forth the feast for the vultures.
But the fact remains that we did not
acquire Cuba, Porto Rico, Hawaii, the
Ladrones and the Philippines by a war of
conquest. We have shown the world that
war can be waged in the interest of
peace. Among the just functions of gov
ernment is the righting of wrongs, which
can only be accomplished by the chastise
ment of evil doers. The dominating in
fluence In our recent war was the gospel
of the humanities. This war, undertaken
In the Interest of law and order and hu
man rights, left us facing the question of
further additions to our territory. We
may not want the addition, but the ques
tion Is can we avoid the moral responsi
bility of taking them under our care. To
withdraw our troops from the new pos
sessions and dispose of the acquired ter
ritory' by sale or otherwise would not only
be cruel and treacherous to the natives
and place us in an unenviable light before
the nations of the world, but It Â¦would,
above all, be forsaking faith with God.
We should as a nation eschew the pride
of conquest, but on the other hand be
willing to assume any responsibility
whatsoever In the interest of broad civil
ization and humanity. If this be expan
sion doctrine, then 1 am proud to preach
it. Undoubtedly the acquisition of this
new territory will benefit not only its in
habitants, but our own country as well.
It will add to our greatness and commer
cial prosperity. But that is not the point.

national life a splendid magnificence In

Since it has been so providentially thrust

beneficial to this country and will If -we
far as the other governments are concern
ed they have all they can do to mind their
business. If. however, any other govern

these natives then it would be but right
for the United States Government to say

ROBERT WATT, vice president of

I I gistsâ I do /lot favor expansion. I
-*Â¦ *â¢ am against it. I never was a strong
believer in the Monroe doctrine, but I
think that in the Philippine transaction
we have thrown it away. We cannot de
fend it until we give up our present policy
of acquisition of foreign territory.
The natives of the islands we have ac
quired are unfit for citizenship. Admit
ting them to the Union will Involve great
danger to nur institutions, even if they
are held only as territories.
I do not favor selling the acquired ter
ritory. I do not believe in selling out any
peopie. I do not think that Spain had
any right to sell the Philippines. I be
lieve in treating the Philippines as we
have promised to treat Cuba. When they
can stand on their own feet we should
let them govern -themselves. A protec
torate, mignt naturally be instituted. It
might be good policy to keep Porto Rico
ana the L.adrones as foreign outposts.
I do not believe in expansion. Tnis is
a' great country, and It will take another
century to develop It. Better pay atten
tion to our own country and leave foreign
countries alone. Many favor territorial
expansion to get trade. 1 do not believe
that expansion Is necessary for trade.

America or South America great ques- i
tions would be opened up. We can draw j
no line where the Monroe doctrine can
safely be set aeide. We must adhere
strictly to it.
The territory we have acquired will
benefit the United States. We have bene
fited by "all previous acquisitions of ter
ritory; and we will all see the benefit of
the later acquisitions. I certainly do not
favor withdrawing our troops or disposing
of any of the islands we have taken.
Cuba we have not taken. To with
draw the troops would not be fair to the
natives, nor would it be fair to dispose of
the property. No other nation in the
world would do that.

ISIDOR GTJT'TBâ
(Manager Pacific Coast Department Mag

I am opposed to expansion. We have
undeveloped territory enough at home
without going 7000 miles abroad to ac
quire more.
I favor the Monroe doctrine decidedly;
but we cannot do much with it if we go
filibustering. We are not to take Cuba.
Porto Kico and Hawaii â we have ail right.
The Philippines we cannot keep without
maintaining an army and navy thero all
the time, i would let the Philippines go
at any price and would wltiuliaw me
troops. The natives are not bting treated
fairly now in the Philippines. We do not
need to expand. We have all Uk \ax\\ a*
home that we can occupy for hundreds
of years. Germany, with its 60 0G0 OX)
people, could be put into California alone
several times.
A. SCHILLINGâ
(Wholesale dealer coffees, teas anÂ«l spices )
I favor expansion. The Monroe doctrine
should not stand in the way of our ad
vancement. The acquisition of cur new
territory will benefit us. No; 1 would not
withdraw our troops nor sell the n*jÂ»v tfÂ»r
ritory. Such action would not be fair in
the natives or to ourselves. ExuanÂ«ion u
a good thing.
T. J. PABSONSâ
(President Del Monte Milling Company.)
I favor expansion with qualifications I
don't see how we can get out of what we
have done. We should adhere to the Mon
roe doctrine. The Maximilian affair and
the recent talk about German colonization
In Brazil Illustrate the necessity to main
tain that doctrine. Â¦ maln "
The acquisition of our new territory in
volves very serious questions. We *hall
make progress for the present by reason
of such acquisition, but the ultima Â»Â»Â«

H. D. LOVELANDâ
(Traffic Manager Pacific Coast Jobbers/
and Manufacturers' Association and
We President of Tillman &: Bendel.)
I am decidedly in favor of expansion. I
favor taking our part in the advance of
the world regardles of the Monroe doc
trine or any other. We will be benefited
by our acquisitions of territory'- The
greatest nation on the earth, numerically
considered, will l>e dismembered, or foot
holds will bo gained In their country in
spheres of influence. If we had not per
formed the part we have during the past
two years the United States would be
without influence in the consideration of
any such matter.
Decidedly 1 do not favor withdrawing
our troops from or disposing of in any
way any territory that we have. Such ac
tion would not be fair to the natives and
it would be cowardly, and be so considered
bv other nations, to refuse to extend civ
ilization to the native people*. We cannot
expand too much, fairly and honestly. If
we become Involved in war with other na
tions by such expansion. I still believe in
it. If the Government sees fit to expand
by purchase, I believe in that.
MANY FAVOR EXPANSION ON AMERICAN CONTINENT
would hold everything, including Cuba.
To leave our new territory would not be
fair tn the natives until they are able to
establish a secure government. We would
suffer in the estimation of other powers,
because it would appear that we were
fearful of asuming responsibilities and
ready to shirk our part in the affairs of
the world. Circumstances have forced ua
into our present position. I do not under
stand that there is any policy of expan
sion. What has already taken place has
been forced upon us. I certainly do not
favor taking in any part of China. I am
opposed to any further expansion outside
of the American Continent. I am in favor
of expansion on the American Continent.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JULY 3, 190a.
WII/LIAM "HAASâ
(President of Associated Wholesale Gro
cers of the Pacific Coast.)
I favor expansion decidedly. I do not
think that we can consider the Monroe
doctrine as much hereafter as we have in
the past. Surely some of our new posses
sions will be of vast benefit to us. As to
otners, I cannot make up my mind, at
present. Hawaii is a bonanza, or will
prove tn be one. AVe should keep the
troops where they are for awhile. I would
not care for the present, to dispose of any
territory until we -know what we have.
We should not consider the natives in this
matter. As for the standing of this Gov
ernment, the world has a good opinion or
it and will always have. As a" 1 general
principle. I favor expansion in all matters
and things.
EDWIN R. DIMONDâ
(Of Williams. Dimond <fe Co.. Shipping and
Commission Merchants.)
We are all for expansion. The acquisi
tion of territory from Spain does not af
fect the Monroe doctrine. We carried out
that doctrine. We have been benefltsd.
Trade has been largely stimulated and we
have seen what will he possible In th^
future by what has already developed. We
should not withdraw our trooops. We can
not sell any of the new territory acquired
any more than we can sell Oklahoma or
Alaska. To sell would not be fair to the
natives. It would make us ridiculous in
the eyes of the world. We all favor the
present policy, but would not favor all
possible expansion. We would not favor
the partition of China. We do not aee any
such political design.
WTLLIAM H. SHERWOOD â
(Manager of Sherwood & Sherwood, Ship
ping and Commission Merchants.)
I am in favor of expansion. I do not
think that the United States should ad
here strictly to the Monroe doctrine, for it
is of no practcal use. It would be much
better for the United States to have Cen
tral America and South America exploited
by the European nations than tÂ« have
them controlled by the revolutionary gov
ernments of the last yo years. Cuba. Porto
Rico. Hawaii, the Ladrones and the Phil
ippines will all benefit the United States.
We should treat them as colonial posses
sions, as the English, do their acquisitions.
and not as a part of the United States.
This country should not surround its fu
ture with the Monroe doctrine, as with a
Chinese wall.
No. it would, be unwise to withdraw our
troops, for the*-lslands promise to be a
source of great wealth to the United
States. Some indication of this is fur
nished by Hawaii, which is. agriculturally,
richer than any part of the older territory
of this country, and the possibilities of
wealth from the Philippines are a hundred
fold greater than those of Hawaii. It is
not for the interest of the natives to have
us withdraw. What has happened in the-
South and Central American States is il
lustrative. The natives need a strong,
government. I personally favor the pol
icy of expansion.
PREPARING FOR THE FOURTH.
Citizens of Sutter Creek Will Cele
brate in Koyal Style.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
JACKSON. July 2.â The citizens of Slit
ter Creek have decided to celebrate ths
Fourth in a most patriotic manner. Be
sides the usual parade to be participated
In by the various civic societies, firemen
and citizens generally, including the Pres
ton School hand and the San Andreas
band, ten athletes from the Olympic Club
of San Francisco have been engaged to
give performances. Colonel I* S. Calkins
of Nevada City will deliver an oration and
Mmf. Klizabeth Reginn Mnwry of San
Francisco -will sine: one or raorf patriotic
sons:?. Rev. James Whltaker will be the
chaplain. For dancing a platform has
been erected which is ninety feet lonar
and the full width of Main street. Every"
house in town will be elaborately dec
orated and there is every reason to ex
pect a celebration that will eclipse even
the sptendld Admission day observance
held last vear.
otherwise I would say adhere to the Mon
roe doctrine. These countries so lately
acquired may prove of great benefit, but
will require the presence of our troops for
some time. The Filipinos, as I under
stand; it; are a class of people unable to
govern themselves, and, as we have taken
tho initiative, we must persevere in the
Course taken and prevent other foreign
nations from interfering.
DR. 3UNNELLâ
There is no doubt In my mind that the
United States hns. profited to a great ex
tent by its war with Spain, speaking com
mercially. Having taken this step 1 think
the United States is morally obliged to
see that the lands acquired are properly
governed.

Â¦W^s Sleep."
Sleeplessness marks the very. climax
of human suffering. It is only a step
removed from insanity. When sleep no
longer restores the 1 exhausted nature, the
struggle with disease cannot last long.
The starting point of the nervous dis-
orders which produce ill - health and
sleeplessness, is generally a diseased
condition of the womanly organs. Re-
store these organs to sound health and
the appetite comes back, the day's work
no longer wearies, and sleep is sound
and refreshing. Dr. Pierce's Favorite
Prescription cures diseases of the wom-
anly organs. . It stops the drains which
weaken women ; it neals the inflamma-
tion and ulceration, and cures female
weakness.
There is no alcohol in " Favorite Pre-
scription" and it is entirely free from
opium, cocaine and all other narcotics.
It is a temperance medicine.
" 5Iy health has been poor for many years and
I had taken a great deal of medicine. Imt it did
me no good." writes Mrs. Rose Kennedy, of
Sprinsbluff. Adams Co., Wis. "Last August mv
health was very poor; I had no appetite an3
could not sltep. I wrote to Dr. Pierce and he
kindly advised me to take his ' Favorite Pre-

in the way of the latter's securing the

who receives it rnt^t go before the people

his claim to the two years then remaining

Joseph H. Choate. AMierican Embassador to Eng

America exists. The Embassador need not unneces
sarily concern himself. Britain needs no biographical
dictionary to know that Uncle Sam is on earth.
California has already made a deep impression upon
the statesmen of our iiewly won Territory of Hawaii.
The guiding political spirits of the islands, learning a

order no extra session of their Legislature, as the ex
periment would be too expensive.
The tribute which thousands of people paid vrith
their presence on Friday afternoon at the Grand

be written in honor of a brave man. The family of
Fireman Sweeney have a heritage worth preserving.
Some of the military prophets now in South Africa
ought to learn a lesson from the proverbial experience
cf their political rivals. The boast that the Boers will

SIGNBOARDS flND BILLBOARDS.
OUT of the Paris Exposition there has already
come a "movement promising to be of great
" benefit not only to Europe, but to this coun
try. It is in the nature of a reform with respect to
billboards and signboards. It appears that. for the
purpose of giving all visitors to the exposition a high
idea not only of Paris, but of all France, the big sign
boards and advertising boards along the railroads and
at the railway stations of that country were removed
Thus travelers are nowhere offended by those glaring
hideous posters that are among the greatest offenses
of the time against art and beauty. The charm of
scenery is^not marred by lurid invitations to buy soap
or pickles, nor by announcements of the unparalleled
virtues of pills and shoeblacking.
Prompted by the French movement the London
County Council has, it is said, recently enacted an
ordinance which empowers the municipal officers to
remove all signboards extended over the street or
sidewalks, and all illuminated signs on the fronts of
buildings that are offensive to public taste. The
change which the ordinance will bring about is ex
pected to be an immense improvement to London,
not only from an artistic standpoint^ but from that of
safety, as many of the big signboards and billboards
of the city are undoubtedly dangerous.
From London the reform movement has reached
New York, and an agitation is now under way in that
city for a suppression of at least the worst of these
street nuisances. It has been suggested that bill
boards and street car and ferry-boat advertisements
should be taxed like other property that yields a large
income, and that where it is carried to excess it should
be prevented altogether.
The prevailing opinion in New York is fairly well
expressed by the Tribune, which after reviewing what
has been accomplished in France and in London says:
"One of these days, it is to be hoped, this country and
this city will institute similar reforms. Nowhere Mn
the World, probably, is the signboard business so
largely practiced as here. Nowhere is public prop
erty so unblushingly appropriated for uses of private
gain. Nowhere," we may confidently beHeve, are ad
vertising signboards, posters and the like made so
offensive to public taste, and in many cases so inimi
cal to public comfort, convenience and even safety.
It is a reproach to civic culture and public spirit that
such disfigurements of what should be our finest
sceriery .should be permitted to proceed with a. free
hand. It is a reflection upon bur thrift and adminis
trative shrewdness that so large and so proper an ob
ject of revenue taxation should be neglected. The
abolition of all offensive, injurious and dangerous
Â¦ signs, and the taxation of all that are permitted to re
main, would be measures not only conducive to ur- 
ban and rural beauty, but also accordant with admin
istrative thrift, with sound business principles and
with. common justice."
The issue, as we all know, is of as much interest to
San Francisco as to any other city in the United
States. It is therefore a matter of satisfaction to note
the westward trend of the reforming movement. If
the artistic impulses emanating from the Paris Expo
sition lead to an" elimination of signboard advertising
from railroads and cities, the benefits will be suffi
ciently great to justify every intelligent man in rising
uo and calling it blessed.
CHIEF SULLIVAN'S order for the arrest of all
scavengc/s found violating the ordinances ot
the city went mto effect yesterday. The order
was strict in its terms and declared: "All wagons
vsed in the transportation of garbage must be lined
with zinc, sheet iron or other metallic substance, and
shall l)t watertight, nr.d the covers must be of oiled
canvas and be securely fastened at all times except
when garbage is being put in the carts, and must be
Â¦, . , . â
on whether the carts Â«re loaded or empty.
The enforcement of these ordinances will be of
great benefit 10 the community, for the nuisance
caused by open garbage wagons traversing the streets
has been one of great offenstvencss. There will still
remain much io be done, however, even alter the
regulations specified by the Chief are enforced. We
shall not have a thoroughly well ordered city in this
respect until the hauling of garbage through . the
streets shall be forbidden during business hours even
in covered carts.
A well-known gentleman in a communication to
The Call yesterday says: Am glad to =ee you are
Â¦still after the scavengers, and trust the good work
will not stop with the regulation of their wagons. Id
going to breakfast about 8 o'clock this morning I
passed three' garbage wagons, and went around a
block to avoid two others, which stunk worse than
u?ua!. Returning to my ofike about 9 I got the bene
fit of two more. In r.ll well regulated cities the re
moval of garbage and the like is required to be done
between midnight and 7 a. m., likewise the sweeping
.of sidewalks. Here men and women going to their
work in the morning get the annoyance of both, be
sides the risk of disease and contagion. San Fran-
Cisco is a commercial city, but not necessarily cheap,
and nasty. New York has the regulations I mention,
and it has done something in the way of commerce.
Do not }et up until we are in line with the most
favored cities."
We have given the letter in full because it is a terse
and plain statement of the existing evils and the re
form that should be accomplished. It will be gratify
ing of course to have the present ordinances en
forced, but. as our correspondent says, the effort ia
the direction of improvement should not cease until
the scavenger nuisance has been abated in all its
forms and the streets are freed from it during the
hours when business, traffic and pleasure are active.
THE SCAVENGER NUISANCE.
1\\Z CLEANING OF CHINATOWN.
PLANS and projects for the reformation or the
removal of Chinatown from its presant quarters
continue to be put forth. Their number attests
the widespread interest taken in the subject, and the
magnitude of some of them proves that the interest is
not only wide but intense. The people are aroused.
The bubonic board and Kinyoun have taught the
whole community a lesson, and on all sides there is
evident an earnest desire to avoid a repetition of the
experience. One quarantine and bubonic scare is
enough. Chinatown must be' cleaned up.
While each of the plans proposed for remedying
the evil has its commendable features, and some of
them are of notable merit, it docs not appear to be
worth while to undertake either of 'them at present.
The prospects are that if the health ordinances of the
city be impartially and firmly enforced in Chinatown,
zv they are in other sections o{ the city, the greater
part of the nuisance will be abated by that very fact,
and the change t\us brought about in the district will
lend to a gradual dispersal of the present population,
so that in the end the whole problem will be solved
without recourse to any extraordinary means.
The decisions of the court in the quarantine cases
are to the effect that the Health Board can make no
icgulations nor the Supervisors enact any health ordi
nances discriminating against Chinese. The course
which The Call recommends would entail no dis
crimination of any kind. It would do no more than
put an end to the discrimination which at present
permits the owners of property in Chinatown to evade
laws that are enforced elsewhere. Against the general
sanitary regulations end orders of the city there can
be no objection on the part of the courts. The appli
cation of those laws to Chinatown would therefore
be a prompt and valid method of getting rid of most
of the abominations that exist there.
It the duty of the Board of Health to see to it
! that the health ordinances are enforced, and it is the
j duty of the Mayor to remove the members of the
I beard if tbey neglect their duty. It happens, however,
1 that the present bubonic board was appointed by the
j present Mayor, and neither the one nor the other can
i be counted on to do the duty which the law imposes
\ upon their office?. The issue, then, is up to the Grand
I Jury. That body has been summonsed to investigate
i the affairs of the county and to report all violations
! of law. The members of this jury have an opportun
i ity to prove the usefulness of the institution. The peo
j pie are ardently waiting for some important step to
be taken toward suppiessing the evils of, Chinatown,
! and the grand jurors can serve the community well
by leading the way.
A resolution was adopted by the Board
of Supervisors yesterday directing the
District Attorney to confer with the Chief
of Police to determine whether the laws
prohibiting public gambling are enforce
able to the end that gambling may be
abated and those who conduct it arrested
and punished. The resolution waa intro
duced by Comte, who said:
*'I ask the passage of the resolutlon.
The press has called attention to the
alarming prevalence of public gambling
and yet nothing seems to have been done.
The bill is intended to determine whether
the laws bearing on the subject are effi
cient or not and I move that the rules
be suspended and the resolution be con
sidered at once." â¢ ; :
No objection being raised to the resolu
tion it was immediately passed. The
measure follows:
Whereas. From time to time the press of
this city has charged that public gambling ex
ists in this city in public places and on main
thoroughfares to the discredit and disgrace
of the city; and.
Whereas, It is provided In section 2 of chap
ter III of article V of the charter that the
District Attorney shall have all the powers
conferred and shall discharge all duties Im
posed upon the District Attorneys of counties
by the general laws of tHIs State, and that
In addition thereto he shall Institute and con
duct On behalf of the people all prosecutions
cognizable In the police court of the city and
county, and shall, when required, advise the
Chief of Police upon matters relating to the
duties of his office; and, .; -~ '
"Whereas,' By the general laws the District
Attorney Is the public prosecutor and must,
under subdivision 2 of section 4206 of the Po
litical Code of this State. Institute proceed
ings before magistrates for the arrest of per
sons charged with or reasonably suspected of
public offenses when he has information that
any such ofTensea have been committed. Now,
therefore, be it
Resolved. That the District Attorney be and
hereby Is requested to consult with the Chief
of Police with the view of obtaining from
him correct information as to such charges Â»o
made by the press, and If the same be true,
then and In such case to report to this board
whether prosecutions can be maintained un
der the provisions of section 330 of the Penal
Code of this State or under the orders and
ordinances of the city and county of San
Francisco or other laws, and If such laws are
inadequate to maintain a prosecution, then
and In such case to advise this board as to
what legislation Is needed in order to enable
prosecution to be maintained successfully
ncal:sFt such public gambling to the end that
the same may be abated and that those who
permit the same or carry on the same may
be arrested and punished.
Be It further resolved. That the clerk of this
board furnish the District Attorney with a
certified copy of this resolution, and also give
another certified copy to the Chief of Police.

vestigation.
ENFORCEMENT OF
ANTI-GAMBLING
LAWS IS URGED
MUST PAY BACK THE
TAXES TO THE BANK
State Has No Bight to Assess Certain
Properties of National Asso
ciations.
The First National Bank of San Fran
cisco has been successful in Its suit
against the city and county of San Fran-
cisco In the action brought to recover
$S2tt> it paid under protest for taxes as
sessed to It upon personal property owned
in March, ISStj. The property consisted of
fixtures valued at $3600 and money on hand
amounting to $5*9.333. In the lower court
the city won. The Supreme Court holds
that the right of the State to exercise Its
power of taxation over the property of a
national bank is limited and defined in
section 5219. Revised Statutes of the
United States. Under the provisions of
that section the real property of the bank
may be taxed "to the same extent ac
cording to its value as other real prop
erty is taxed" and the shares In the as
sociation may be assessed as other per
sonal property to the owners or holders
thereof and taxed in such a manner as the
Legislature may determine and direct, etc.
As the authority of the State to tax
the property of the association Is derived
from this section It can exercise this pow
er only to. the extent and in the mode pre
scribed by the section. The provision for
assessing the shares of the association to
the owners or the holders thereof is the
only authority given to the State under
which it may tax the personal assets of
the bank and an assessment to the bank
of its personal assets is void. The judg
ment of the Superior Court was reversed
and the court below was directed to enter
judgment In favor of the bank for the
amount prayed for in its complaint.

The contracts for lighting the public
buildings for six months from July 15
were awarded by the Board of Supervisors

CONTRACTS FOR
CITY LIGHTING
ARE AWARDED
The assessment roll for the city and
county for the year 1900 wa3 transmitted
to the Board of Supervisors yesterday by
Assessor Dodge. The total assessed valu
ation of property Is $405,740,000. the revenue
from which will be great enough
to allow of the sum of $200,000 being spent
for public Improvement. Supervisor Keed
immediately introduced an ordinance,
which was passed to print, setting aside
that sum as a public improvement fund
and authorizing the board to determine
the various Items of expenditures to be
apportioned therefrom.
The Assessor's llgures prove the esti
mate of Auditor Wells, made a month
ago. In which he based his tax rate on an
assessed valuation of H0u.0UO.0Ou. to have
been correct. The Auditor In his budget
sets aside the sum of $200,000. which was
included in the dollar limit b Â«Â« wa Â»
eliminated by the board in Its nnal report.
The Assessor strongly protested against
the assumption of a *Wv,0OO,0O0 valuation,
but he has exceeded it by J5.740.000.
Of the entire roll, real estate, with im
provements thereon, amounts to Jjss.aw.
uuu, and personal property to Jllo.boO.tXX).
There has been added to the roll of last
year $30,000,000 of newly discovered per
sonal property, which will now contribute
revenue to the city In the way of taxes
for the first time. This gain of $30,000,000
of personal property la made up as fol

Large estates 4.<*0.Â«Â»
Franchises 5.000.000

Total $30.00O,C0O
In an official report accompanying the
roll Dodge says:
The courts b- their decision struck from the
roll of last year about J18.000.COO of bonds and
$7,000,000 of national bank stock, which I, act
ing under the Instruction of the State Board
of Equalization, had added to the roll. These
Bums being recognized Ia3t year, when the tax
levy was tlxed. aa a doubtful source of revenue,
the city's Income was estimated and collected,
not on the: entire roll of I40S.CO0.0tu, but on a
tax roll of $375,000,000. as againat the roll of
t3oO OtO.000 of the previous administration.
This year, however, there will be available for
revenue a rcIT of at least $305,000,000. The bal
ance of this years roll Is made up of assess
ments such aa national bank stocks and that
of some franchises, which will probably ba
tested In the courts, and hence it is not safe to
take the same Into consideration in fixing the
sum on which to estimate our revenue. The
addition to this year's roll of such new personal
property as taxes will undoubtedly be collected
upon will increase the city's estimated revenue
$200,000. This additional sum being outside of
your present estimate of expenses and appro
priations will now be available ror such public
Improvements aa you may deem It wise to
make.
I regret that I could not foretell this increase,
for the guidance of your honorable board when
you were estimating the revenue of tha city
and fixing the tax rate, but until the assess
ment rolla are completed and added, which
work has only been finished within twenty-four
hours, it is Impossible to lorm even an accu
rate estimate of the amount of the roll. ThU
fact will always be an embarrassment, while
the tax levy has to be fixed early In Jun*. In
stead of September, aa heretofore.
It will be noted that real estate and the im
provements thereon are assessed this year for
}2!kM4C>.0OO. as asalnst S:S5.465.000 In USD, or an
increase of $3,000,000. This Increase Is almost
entirely made up of new buildings, land values
having been raised only in rare instances. Real
estate In several sections of this city Is. and
has been for a number of years, assessed en
tirely too high. It has always been my desire
and ambition to reduce land values In thesÂ«
sections, and your board has on the tile of las;
year communications from me asking for the
additional help, then needed, to make the neces
sary reappralsement of land values, which Is
a task of considerable magnitude. Unfortu
nately your finances were in such a condition
that you were unable to furnish me the neces
sary help. I desire, however, to inform your
honorable board that it la my Intention to re
duce the valuation of real estate and the Im
provements thereon whenever such reduction Is
warranted durine the coming year. Such re
ductions will. In my opinion, aggregate fully
I1O.COO.00O, and It Is my hope that I will now
be able, unaided, to carry out this plan. The
tax roll of this year, therefore, must bÂ« modi
fied to this extent. If it is to be used as a guidÂ«
In fixing the expenditures of the fiscal year
1901-1902.
In conclusion this office desires to congratu
late your honorable board on being able to
begin the new fiscal year with a clean balance
sheet, no deficit as in former years, being car
ried forward, and on your possessing the fur
ther assurance of now having a large surplus
fund at your command for needed public im
provements. I desire also to assure your board
of the active and cheerful co-operation of this
department In your attempt to establish the
finances of this city on a permanent and sate
as well as an equitable basis.
â¢ As Illustrating what this office has accom
plished In this direction, it may be stated that
the exrw?nses of our department during the
past year have been kept strictly within our
ar^ropriatlon. which was, however, entirely ln
sutflcient. thus effecting a saving of $2),0C0 In
salaries alone. In two years we have added
over $-*50.P00 to the Income of the city (thia rep
resenting the elty tax on $45,000,000 increased
valuation), and without Increasing the burden
of taxation on the taxpayers at larse. such
Increase being made up of personal property
which had previously escaped taxation or been
greatly underassessed.
Trusting that this work will merit UjÂ« ap
proval of your honorable board, and will entltla
this department to such financial or other as
sistance as we deem the demonstrated Impor
tance of this work may. from time to time, de
mand, I am very respectfully yours,
WASHINGTON DODGE. Assessor.
The board decided to meet Thursday at
2 p. m. as a Board of Equalization to

e BOXERS VltW OF.IT.
BY way of reply to the continuous repetition in
the journals of Europe and. of America that the
invasion of China by the powers is justified by
the fact that the invaders will carry to the people of
that country a higher civilization than they now pos
sess, a Chinese merchant doing business' in England
has presented to the London Express the Chinese
view of the situation. He claims to be a member of
the "Boxer" society, and therefore asserts a right to
His first declaration is that China has had a civiliza
tion similar to that" now existing in the Western world
and has passed from ii to a better one. He says:
"There was a time when we had your struggle for
existence, the race for wealth, the ambition for power,
and all Â«tlfc haste, the hurry, and the worry. We had
also many clever inventions, gunpowder, printing and
the rest, but in the end we found that all these things
are unnecessary. We had our periods of religious
dissensions and fanaticism. We had our reformers
and our martyrs, and then we reached toleration. We
have outgrown all those strifes. We have learned
wisdpm. Our passions and our ambitions have set
tled down to a calm desire for happiness in this world;
our religion is reduced to a philosophy of life. We
believe that the best thing to pursue in this world is
happiness, and we teach our children that their hap
piness can be secured only by the performance of
duty. We believe in making the best of this life,
which is the only one we know anything about for
certain." .
Having laid, down that much by way of stating the
condition of Chinese civilization and religion, he went
on to discuss the present situation. "You purpose/'
he said, "to revive in China the worry, the disturb
ance and the strife of the old times. You wish to
introduce a new religion concerning another life in
another world, about which you cannot agree among
yourselves. You invite us to build railways, for which
we have no use. You wish us to build factories so as
to debase Qur beautiful arts and handicrafts, and pro
duce machine-made finery in place of our delicate
textures and hues. Against all that we protest. We
wish to be let alone. We wish to be free to enjoy our
calm life and the fruits of our centuries of experience.
We do not wish to be tormented by quarrels about
another world when our duty is to be happy in this
one. When we ask you to go away you refuse, and
you even threaten us with subjugation if we do not
give you our harbors, our towns and our land. Now,
having carefully considered the matter, we of the so
called 'Boxer Society' have decided that the only
way to get rid of you is to kill you. We are not
bloodthirsty. We are not robbers. But when per
suasion, arguments and appeals to your sense of jus
tice are of no avail, we find ourselves face to face
with the fact that our only recourse is to put you out
of existence." . Â»
Such is the view of the situation taken by the
Boxers. It is another illustration of the impossibility
of getting harmony between two widely different civi
lizations. That the aggressions of Europe upon China
have been unjust is not to be denied. Out of the in
justice done to them the Chinese have themselves be
come unjust, and their rage now falls upon the inno
cent. Western civilization must protect the traders
and the missionaries who under treaties of peace have
gone to China, and war has become inevitable. Never
theless, the statements of the Boxer to the Express
n:ake very pertinent reading, and men of impar
tial minds will admit the truth of much of what he

THE POTHOUSE BOSSES.
! J/OELLY and Crimmins have about as much right
! |\ in the Republican party as a burglar has in a
j * *Â¦ bank. They have entered it solely for what they
; can get out of it. To them and their Mint saloon fol-
I lowing politics is a means of obtaining boodle and
I swag. Even when they are most decent and assume a
respectability they get no further than to support a
I jobseeker in his effort to become a taxeater and live
1 at the expense of the taxpayers. Neither of the two
I bosses nor any of the gang that follows knows or
j cares much about party principles or party policies.
i They have fastened themselves upon Republicanism
! only because they hope to be able to prey upon it.
j Their very presence in the party discredits it to some
1 extent, and if they be permitted to attain to any in
i fluence in its counsels they will drive from the ranks
' two good citizens for every vicious bum they can
bring in.
The fight which these disreputable men are nOw
making for what they have the impudence to call a
"satisfactory representation" in the county conven
tion is a matter of more importance than many Re
publicans are aware. The voters of San Francisco
have become intolerant' of boss politics. In recent
elections thousands of good Republicans have voted
against the party ticket simply^ because there was a
suspicion of an affiliation with Crimmins and Kelly,
and as a result the city is now misgoverned by a
Democratic administration. We have seen what is
the result of that kind of voting. The streets are un
swept and ill-lighted. A bungling Board of Health,
in an effort to do politics, has injured the trade of the
city to the extent of millions of dollars by starting a
senseless bubonic quarantine. Such are some of the
effects of allowing Crimmins and Kelly a "satisfac
tory representation" in Republican conventions.
What Republican is willing to repeat the experi
ment?
From the enrollments made in the districts it is well
assured the better element of the party will have such
success in the organization of the clubs and in the
nomination of delegates for the convention as to be
reasonably certain of 2 thorough control of that body.
That is gratifying, but it is not enough. It will not
take the pothouse bosses long to hoodoo the best
ticket the party can put up if they are given an oppor
tunity to do so. The best and safest way is for hon
est Republicans to nominate a clean ticket in every
district where Kelly and Crimmins control the club
nominations. It is better for the party to fight the
bos?cs out of the convention than in it, on the same
principle that it is better to keep a polecat out of
vour house than to let him in and then try to put
*Â¦-.'Â¦
him out.
redress, and now that charges are made of bribery and
corruption growing out of the injustice of the laws, it
is likely the petitions will be granted and Klondike
mining will enter upon a new phase.
THE SAJN JfKAJSCJSCO CALL, TUESDAY, JULY 3, 1900.
6
REPORTS' of dissatisfaction with the Canadian
laws and the manner of their enforcement in the
Klondike country have been so frequent that
little or no surprise follows the announcement that
formal complaints have been made against some of
the prominent officials of the district. The laws ap
pear to be so unfair as. to almost amount to an en
couragement to fraud, and it was well nigh inevitable
that the men charged with the duty of enforcing
them should bend them now and then to the advan
tage of themselves and their friends.
So unjust are many of the laws and so unjustly
have they been administered that the Canadians have
almost killed the goose that laid them the golden
eggs. Despite the known richness of the country
around Dawson. thousands of hardy and adven
turous miners have left it for mining districts under
the American flag. It is true there is confusion at
Koine and not much order anywhere on the Ameri
can side of the line, but there is a chance for a man
to obtain a claim, and if it prove "rich the riches will
be for himself. On the Canadian side of the line,
however, it appears the law takes almost all from the
prospector and the officials take the rest.
The illibcrality of the Canadian Government in
dealing, with miners in. the Klondike and elsewhere
within her territory his been in striking contrast to
the liberal spirit that shows itself in the mining laws
of this country, but it is now believed a change will
be made and the Dominion will encourage mining
hereafter instead of putting upon it such burdens as
have come near to mining even so rich a district as
the Klondike. Strong petitions have" been sent by
the Canadians themselves from Dawson askine' for

DETAILS OF GERMAN
MINISTER'S MURDER
: BERLIN. July 2.â Privy Councilor Ham
rnann said to-day that the dispatch
announcing Baron von Ketteler's assassi
nation was received here to-day, it was
bas*l upon a direct written message con
veyed from Peking .and signed by Von
Bergen, a member of the German legation
at Peking, and Sir Robert Hart, the In
epector GenrraJ of Customs. It was ad
dressed to the commander of the Euro
pean forces? at Tientsin and was forward
ed June 24 by Consul Zimmerman to the
German Consul at Chefu. The message
contained a number of interesting de
tails. Baron von Ketteler, while riding
on horseback to the Tpung LI Yemen
< Foreign Office) was attacked by larg*
numbers of Chinese, who pulled him off
hi? horse and beat him to death.
An interpreter who was with him was
seriously injured, but escaped and subse
quently reached the German legation.
Herr Hanmann supposes that there wa-s
more bloodshed at the legation, the de-
Ftruction of which, he declares, wa3 more
alarming, because the message adds the
condition of the whites was desperate
and protection was imperatively needed.
It was announced that the ammunition
was also exhausted.

CONFIRMS THE BAD
NEWS FROM PEKING
WASHINGTON*. July 2.â Bad news
came this morning from Admiral Kempff,
confirming the worst stories which have
emanated from China relative to the con
ditions at Peking, and a feeling of dis
quiet was noticeable among administra
tion officials and diplomats. The German
embassy showed particular anxiety for
Information respecting the pad murder of
Baron von Ketteler. and in the course of.
the afternoon Secretary Herrmann of the
embassy paid a special visit to the State
Department.
M. Thiebaut, the charge of the French
embassy, also called, in quest of Informa
tion It was said. These visits revived ru
mors that an effort is afoot to reach an
international agreement respecting the
conduct of the forces of the powers in
China. It was said this afternoon at the
State Department that the only news was
that there seemed to be a unanimous
agreement on the part of the powers to
welcome with the utmost cordiality Ja
pan's offer to furnish reinforcements for.
the forces now operating along the Peiho
River In the effort to reach Peking, as
Japan, alone of the powers, is prepared
to throw into China whatever number of
troops may be needed. The news to that
effect had come to the State Department
from all directions, and particularly from
England, Russia and France.
As far as the State Department Is con
cerned, it had previously accorded Japan
a free hand in the matter of the number
of troops to be employed in China, upon
a voluntary and courteous statement of
the purpose of the employment of these
forces.
A gathering in Secretary Hay's office
late in the afternoon of Secretary Root
and Secretary Hitchcock, taken in con
nection with the fact that Secretary Long
had been In conference earlier In the day
with the Secretary of State, led to the
circulation of rumors that Important de
velopments were to be expected connected
with the strengthening , of the United
States forces now in China. These ru
mors, however, were speedily set at rest
hy the statement from one of the partici
pants that the conference had nothing. to
do with the Chinese affair, but related to
some Indian troubles In the Northwest.
Secretary Root did not hesitate to enter
Into a Fpedflc denial of some of the sensa
tional stories which are persistently clr
<ulated every day regardless of facts. He
paid that he had not ordered any troops
to China beyond the Ninth Infantry from
Manila, now on the way to Taku. and pos
sibly the Sixth Cavalry, about to start
from Fan Francisco for Nagasaki. The
destination of the latter would depend
upon developments. He said he had not
ordered the Fourth and Eighteenth regi
ments of infantry to China, as had been
reported in some quarters, nor had he
made the slightest preparation for their
dispatch.
Respecting the withdrawal^ of troops
from Cuba, the Secretary said that he did
not himself know which of the regiments
would be first brought home. GeneraJ
Miles and General Wood were trying to
settle that question, there being some dif
ference as to whether the withdrawals
should be based upon the order in which
the regiments had gone to Cuba or upon
other condition*, such as the conditions of
their service and the need at home for
cavalry or infantry organizations.
Secretary Long contradicted the report
that the New Orleans was to be sent to
Taku, or elsewhere in China, and added
that he did not even Intend to send out
another chip to _ make up the deficiency
caused by the ciisafi^er to the Oregon-,

TIENTSIN. Jur.p 2?. via Chefu. July I, and Shanghai, July 3. â A courier from
E:r Robert Hart. Inspector General of Customs at Peking, has just arrived. He
left Peking on Monday. July 25. and reports the situation desperate. On June IS, he
reports. Baron von Ketteler, the German Minister, and his secretary attempted to
visit the Tsur.g LJ Yamen. He was shot four times and died at the rooms of the
Tp jr.g U Yamen. His secretary succeeded in making his escape.
All of the legation? rxc-pt the German, British and ItaJian have been de-
Ftroyed. ThÂ» diplomats and missionaries are in the British legation under rifle
flre. Cannon command the legations, but they are not being used. It is impossi
ble to start relief at present.
Captain McCalla. commander of the Newark, estimates that &0.000 soldiers will
be required to relieve the Ministers in Peking.
DIPLOMATS AND MISSIONARIES
FIGHTING FOR THEIR LIVES
LfTSTXys, July 3, 3 A. M. â The allies are not advancing for the relief of
Pokinp. This announcement to the House of Commons by William SL
J.'hn Broderick, Un<5Â«Â«r Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, was received
with exclamations of astonishment ar.d dismay. Sir Ellis Ashmead Bartiett
Inquired for any information that had been received from the legations at
Pekffig; or as to the composition and command of the relieving force and of the
present position. Mr. Kroderiok read the dispatches received to-day and said the
total nlliod force available is now about 13,000, as troops have been rapidly arrlv
injr. addiry?:
"We do not yet know what arrangements have been made locally regarding
the command of an expedition, but It has not yet been thought possible to at
tempt a ft:rther advance. The Consuls have been In communication with tho Vice
roys In the Yangtze region end they are quite well aware that support will be
givoTi them by her Majesty's Government in preserving order. It Is obviously
bspossfble th:it the representatives of the powers at Peking should be consulted,
as no communication:-, are passing between them."
"The situation Is desperate. Hasten."
The<=e words froin the message of Von Burgen, a member of the German Le
pstion at Peking, countcrsig-ed by Sir Rcrert Hart, Inspector General of Customs,
an.', lilted Bine days ago, are the theme of all private comment. They are pre-
Tiarlr.g for news of a frightful tragedy. Nine days ago the ammunition, of the
little garrison defending the foreigners was running low and their food was
nearly oxhaiistpd, while around them was a horde of Kan Su bravos, having at
their service Kri:rP guns and repeating rlSes. Peking was in the hands of the
revolutior.nrips.
While nothing but sinister news comes from Northern China, Southern China
S-s 5~emsr.3!y breaking away from the empire. All the provinces south of the Yel
|<rcr River, whose Viceroys and Governors maintain friendly relations with the
.powers through the Consuls, have been Informally constituted into a confeder
acy, with Nanking as the capital.
According to an express cable from Shanghai, dated July 2, the Southern
Â¦Viceroys 'wholly disavow Prince Tuan's Government. They^have practically con
stituted an independent State, extending from the Hoangho to the British and
Â»er.ch frontiers. little else to illuminate the profound obscurity of the situation
reaches cable points. The Chinese wires to Chefu appear, to be interrupted.
I-ast right St. Petersburg was informed over the Siberian wires that the de
struction of the Russian railways in Manchuria continues, and it seems not im
probable that Russia will be fully occupied for a time In suppressing the insur
rec:ion among its subject Chinese and may be unable to send more troops imme
diately to Taku. The powers look more and more to Japan to supply the force
necessary a: once to grapple with the formidable rebellion.

SITUATION IS DESPERATE AT PEKING
Boxers Opposing- the Advance of the Foreigners to Peking.
(ThÂ« above picture, taken from Le Journal Illustre, shows the Russian wing of the foreign column In bat
tle with the Chinese.)
GERMANY WILL INSIST
UPON FULL SATISFACTION
Murder of Minister von Ketteler Causes the
Kaiser to Decide to Send a Big Land and
Naval Force to China.
The North German Gazette says:
"Above all the International forces must
now take Peking and stop the anarchy
there."
Baron von Ketteler's death, mentioning
particularly his courage and strong sense
of duty. The Kruez Zeltung says Ger
many cannot allow the murder to go un
punished, and especially if the proof 1?
furnished that the Chinese government
has made common cause with the Boxers.
The paper argues strongly for the send
ing of a large German force, since they
aro assured of bases of operation at Taku
and Tientsin. The Tageblatt talks more
heatedly. It says this deed will force Ger
many Into the first ranks of interested
powers, while hitherto she was behind
Russia, England and France. The paper
expresses confidence that this unpar
alleled crime will create a sentiment of
European solidity, so that the blood of
Baron von Ketteler will become a cement,
uniting the whole white race against the
yellow.
BERLIN; July 2.â From well authenti
cated sources the representative of the
Associated Press is able to state that to
day, after the detailed statement by Count
von Bulow, Secretary of State for For
eign Affairs, regarding the Chinese situa
tion. Emperor William made up his min.1
to Insist upon full satisfaction for the
death of Baron von Ketteler, for which
purpose he resolved to send altogether
armed forces approximately as large as
those of the other powers chiefly Inter
ested in restoring order In China. The
precise size of the forces has not yet been
determined upon, but It is expected they
will amount to a score of thousands. A
considerable portion of the German fleet
will be sent also. This is evidenced by
orders issued to-day to prepare five new
battleships for sailing. It is understood
that Prince Henry of Prussia has re
quested the Emperor to give him com
mand of this division, but It Is doubtful
If his Majesty will agree to this.
The Emperor and Count von Bulow are
fully aware that constitutional difficulties
render difficult the dispatching of so large
a contingent, but both are agreed that It
must be done. In this they are supported
by the singularly unanimous attitude of
the German press. To-night a number of
leading papers are seriously discussing
means of fulfilling the nation's wish to
make reprisal against China correspond
ingly severe with the outrages.
At the Foreign Office to-night the situa
tion for Germany was described as most
difficult, especially since the latest news
shows that serious trouble Is Impending
in Shantung. The Chinese Legation here
Is still smilingly smug. Minister Lu Hal
Houn said that he was extremely sorry
for the bloody events In Peking, but he
felt sure that the Dowager Empress was
guiltless. From an Interesting chat with
him the point seems worth recording that
the Minister took it for granted that the
powers will subdue the revolt in China
and then arrange a new government.
The press to-night unanimously deplores
What Will Become of China?
None can- foresee the outcome of the quarrel
between foreign powers over the division of
China. It is interesting to watch the going: to
pieces of this ancient but unprogresslve race.
Many people in : America, are also colne to
pieces because of - dyspepsia, constipation,
blood, liver and stomach diseases. We are liv
ing too fast, but strength, vigor and good
health can be retained If we keep off and cure
the above diseases' with" Hoatetter*a: Stomach

REFUSE TO RATIFY
THE AGREEMENT
WASHINGTON, July 2.â After forty
eight hours' consideration and probably
after consulting the President at Canton
by wire, the Cabinet officers here have de
cided not to ratify the agreement of nine
articles providing for the neutralization of
Shanghai and the Southern Chinese treaty
ports, submitted by Minister Wu. There
were some things in the agreement which
the Government felt that it could not ac
cept.'
Such, for Instance, was tho . absolution
proposed to be extended to the Chinese
Government in advance for many out
rages that might occur ln v the treaty
ports. The Government has, however, no
objection to the principles embodied in
the agreement, and has therefore told
Consul Goodnow by telegram that it
might pledge the American Government to
commit no act of hostility so long as the
Viceroy of the province is able to keep
the peace and will protect foreigners.
This determination has been made known
to the other powers.
There is every disposition on the part of
the Government to encourage such an
agreement, for they will not only relieve
the Government of the necessity of main
taining a large naval force at the south
ern treaty ports, but will tend to
strengthen decidedly whatever opposition
there may be In China to the anti-foreign
element headed by Prince Tuan.
Our Government is convinced, that this
leader does not represent the Chinese Gov
ernment. It also Is satisfied that the of
ficial class of China generally, the men of
Influence and learning, are decidedly op
posed to Tuan's policy. Holding this
view, our Government Is still convinced
that a state of war with China does not
exist: that we are merely opposing an in
surrectionary mob, even though that mob
has been swelled by Chinese soldiers.
WOULD DESTROY GRAVES.
BERLIN, July 2.â The consular body at
Tientsin has unanimously proposed to
their governments as the sole means of
saving the foreigners at Peking that the
united powers should inform the Chinese
authorities , that the graves, of the an
cestors of the imperial family at Peking
will be destroyed if the foreigners at
Peking, especially the Ministers, are
harmed. It is understood Great Britain
is not disposed to adhere to the proposi
tlon.
LOSS AMONG ITALIAN'S.
ROME. July 2.â The commander of the
Italian warship Elba cables from Taku
that the Italian detachment at Tientsin
had a lieutenant and -six sailors killed
during: the recent- fisbtinjr there.
KEMPFF REPORTS
LEGATIONS BESItGED
WASHINGTON, July 2.â The Navy De
partment has received the following ca
blegram from Admiral KempfT, without
date:
"CHEFU.â Secretary of Navy, Washing
ton: Rumor from Peking reports legations
are besieged: provisions nearly exhausted;
situation desperate. German Minister go-

Tientsin; communication to Tientsin by
rail and river insecure. KE1IPFF."
ADMIRAL BRUCE REPORTS.
I.OXDON*, July 2.â A dispatch from Ad
miral Bruce to the Admiralty to-day,
dated Taku, June 30, practically repeats
Admiral Kempft's story brought to Tient
sin by a runner who left Peking June
26. Bruce adds:
"As the allied troops have been arriving
rapidly, we do not know what arrange
ments have been made locally for the
command of the new' expedition. But it
has not yet been thought' possible to at<
tempt a further advance."
FRENCH CONSTJXATE STRUCK.
PARIS, July 2.â The French Consul at
Tientsin telegraphs, under date of Juno

"Several shells were fired into the town
yesterday e%'enlnpr. one of them falling on
the French consulate and damaging the

General MacArthur Has Cabled That
Further Withdrawals Would
Have a Bad Effect.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, July 2.-Though in
formed of the surrender and capture of
two more generals of the insurgent army
in the Philippines, and consequently en
couraged thereby, it is nevertheless a fact
that Major General MacArthur has in
formed the War Department that it is
Inadvisable to Â¦withdraw troops from the
islands at this moment. .
After the November elections It is ex
pected that at lea*t 20,000 men can be
spared for service in China, but in view
of the belief that would now rapidly
spread among the Filipinos, in case of the
withdrawal of troops, that the United
States is unable to deal with the situa
tion and proposes to relinquish sover
eignty over the archipelago, it has been
decided not to detach any more regiments
from General JIacArthur's command ex
cept under stress of absolute necessity
The only insurgent generals of import
ance rtill directing operations against the
American forces are Afrulnaldo and Gen
eral Tino. Both are believed to be in the
mountains of Benguet. The capture of
General Ricarte is believed to be espe
cially important. He was one of the in
surgent commanders who opposed Gen
eral Anderson's advance during the earlv
days of the rebellion. The fact that the
native police apprehended him is pointed
out as an indication of the great value of
this service. Ricarte is the second promi
nent man arrested by the native police.

time the Governor had Wt the train since
leaving Chicago, all his jirovtous speeches
having been made from the rear platform
of his private car. His address was along
the Fn-mo llr.es as those delivered at To
peka and Kmporfa. touching upon the
questions of imperialism and silver.
"You cf the West." he said, "were told
four yrars apo that you would not get

prosper. Now we have achieved prosper

On the way back to his car the Governor

5:30 o'clock, and was signed by the strik
ers' grievance committee. Chairman T. B.

and the Transit Company and Its former
employes.
"Concessions were necessarily made by
both parties. After having duly consid
ered the tremendous proportions the
strike had assumed, and taking into con
sideration the terrible inconvenience to
v/hich citizens have been put, both par
ties are relieved to know that the trou
ble is over and that business can now as
sume its normal conditions."
For some time negotiations have been
conducted quietly . looking toward a set
tlement. The only point of difference was
finally the matter of restoring the strikers
to other places. The men at first de
manded that each one of them should re
ceive the place he had before the strike."

CHICAGO. July 2.â A bold attempt by
two masked men to loot the safe in the
office of the Globe Laundry Company
early to-day was frustrated by an acci
dent that may prove fatal to one of the
marauders. In exploding dynamite to
shatter the lock of the Inner door of the
safe one of the men had his right hand
torn away and his wrist shattered, while
the other thief was struck in the face by
a fragment of flying steel.
The injured men fled, leaving gagged
and bound on the floor three men em
ployed by the company, whom they had
surprised sleeping: in the room adjoining
the office on the second floor.
The mishap saved a large sum to the
company, the officials Intimating that the
safe contained thousands of dollars, but

dealt out to the men to-day, and suits of
clothing were erlven to every man that
asked for them. Food and shelter was
provided for the company'c men. Superm
intendent Moeler of the North Gorman
Llovd line late to-night returned from
his "trip to the v.nrious vessels that lay in
the river. Concerning the general situa
tion at this hour he said:
"The steamship Bremen can be repaired
without great outlay. She burned until
C o'clock to-night, when the last flame
wns stifled. The steamship Main is still
on "fire I believe she will be a total loss.
The Paale lies down in the water. The
wrecking boats started at work on her
right away and she probably will bo float
ing in several days. Her portholes were
shut and water was pumped out of her as
fast as possible. She has raised about
twelve fert. but she is so far under there
are no estimate? as to how badly she Is
damaged. All above is practically
wrecked." , , _
Yesterday the great scenes of the fire
were more on the big steamers that lay
burning on the river than at the dock?,
which were Ju=t a rile of smoking ruin?:
but to-day, when the bodies began to be
found In pairs, in groups of half a dozen,
and then by dozens, the scene that pre
sented was most gruesome. Hundreds of
thousands of people were banked up in
the streets all day long and watched lit
tle groups of men that brought in bodies
from the ends of the pier. Thousands of
email children were allowed In the crowds
to view the horrible spectacle, and women
with babies in their arms craned their
necks to get a glimpse of sights from
which many turned their faces. Through
the streets all day long the dead-wagon
rattled.
Sad Scene at the Morgue.
At the New York Morgue, where twelve
bodies are now lying, the most horrible
phases of the lire are shown. Each body
is In a nine box. As the people come Into
the building looking for dead friends and
relatives the men of the place, who have
become hardened to all human sympathy,
slide out body after body and push it back
unfeelingly as the person passes on de
pp.iirinely to the next. The scenes â¢ at
these places are enough to turn the heart
of almost any man.
Second Officer Sanders of the Saale
said to-njght that several of the officers
of the steamships would issue a state
ment in several days, signed and sworn
to, that the captains of the tugs did not
do all in their power to help the ships
that were lyinir in their docks. Officer
Sanders *ald that his ship had been cut
loope from the pier and that he and an
other officer stood on the stern of the
Fhip with men ready to man lines to" the
tugboats. He said they shouted to the
tupboat captains, but that no response
was made, the tugs simply lying by un
til they could get near enough to the
great Kaiser Wiihelm der Grosse to ren
der enough assistance to claim salvage.
CAPTAIN MIROW, COMMANDER OF THE SAALE.
NEW YORK, July 2.â The Morgue authorities to-day identified one body
as that of Captain Mirow of the Saale. On the body were found the cap
tain's knife, watch and chain and a portion of his notebook. Captain Mirow
entered the service of the North German Lloyd many years agro and arose
by promotion to the rank of captain seven or eight years ago. His record
as an offltrer had been a very successful one and remarkably devoid of mis
baps.

caped damage. The tracks of the Detroit,
Grand Haven and Milwaukee Railroad,
a short distance norths of the reservoir,
were undermined and trains on that road
were obliged to make a detour via other
roads. '
The break was first seen by Burt Bots
ford, a boy delivering morning news
papers. It was then only a tiny stream,
but, realizing the danger, the boy aroused
hundreds from sleÂ«p and urged them to
escape. The reservoir gave way at the
gate house near Livingston street, pour
ing down the hill a stream thirty-six feet
wide and ten feet deep. A number of
houses were swept from their founda
tions and carried away on the flood and
crushed. Some streets were torn up to
a depth of forty feet.
Mrs. Cooper of Clancy street was liter
ally swept out of her house by the flood.
She was carried to the bottom of the hill
and burled to her neck in sand. She was
rescued alive but probably will die.
No other casualties were reported.
Rough estimates place the damage at
J200.0V0.
The reservoir was on the top of a hill
of considerable height. Livingston street,
to the south, roaches almost to the gats
of the reservoir. East of Livingston
street the land descends by high terraces,
which are occupied in series by Coil ave
nue and Clancy and North Lafayette
streets. The reservoir broke on the Liv
ingston-street side, the flood dividing into
two streams, the main stream running
down Livingston street to Newberry.
thence straight across to the Detroit,
Grand Rapids and Milwaukee Railroad,
cutting Coil avenue and Clancy and North
Lafayette streets and continuing across
the railway tracks to the Junction of Ma
tilda and Prospect streets. The othf;r
stream went down Bradford street until
it united with the first at the railroad,
whence the water ran into Coldbrook
Creek.
One hundred houses in all were wrecked
or badly damaged. The break in the res
ervoir grew until it was thirty feet wide
and more than ten feet deep.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JULY 3, 1900.
captured by Charley Hood at Casa Grande
on Saturday night, was brought here to
day from Tombstone and placed in the
County Jail. The officers were afraid that
friends would attempt to take him if he
were kept in the Tombstone Jail. He was
in consultation with the officers all after
noon, and It is believed that the capture
of Alvord and Bravo Juan is being planned
with the assistance of Stiles. Stiles when
seen this afternoon said:
"I have decided not to talk to report
ers."
Burt Grover. who brought Stiles from
Tombstone, would not talk about the ar
rest. District Attorney Land is here, and
he also refused to talk. They are no doubt
trying to use Stiles to capture Alvord and
Bravo Juan.

The Fourth of July toy cannon pur
chased by William Macmillan, the 12-year
old son of Willis M. Macmillan of 123
Chattanooga street, worked like a charm
at its initiatory trial Jn a Mission sandlot
yesterday. Macmillan, with a young com

lot with the new gun and a flask of black
powder. After loading the cannon to the
muzzle Curran applied a match while
Macmillan held on to the barrel to steady
the cannon. The explosion carried away
a portion of Macmlllan's right thumb. This
put a Ptop to the artillery practice and
the young artJHerlft was taken to the

Shortage Due to Clerical Errors.
Ex-Tax Collector Sheehan has deposited
$315 91 with City Treasurer Brooks to
cover the shortage caused by clerical er
rors during his administration of that of
fice. This amount, however; only covers
the shortage mentioned in Sheehan's own
"report. The clerks in the Tax Collector's
office have discovered an additional short
age of J351 94 and have not yet completed
the examination.
Tax Collector Scott has filled the posi
tion made vacant by the death of J. H.
Hegler by promoting William H. Villette,
a clerk in the tax office. Louis Devoto
was 'appointed as successor to Villette.
Tax Collectors must in the future, ac
cording to the act of 1895. which goes into
effect to-day, deed to the State all prop
erties on which delinquent taxes remain
unpaid for five years.
EX-GOVERNOR BUDD AND
GAVIN M'NAB IN COURT
Partiality of the Latter to Proxies
Sarcastically Referred To by
the Former.
Ex-Governor Budd was the center of in
terest during the hearing of the. action
by which Insurance Commissioner Clunio
seeks to recover a license fee and to com.
pe! the Pacific Debenture Company to fur
nish a bond as Is required under the law
of all insurance companies. During. the
argument ex-Governor Budd made two
announcements worthy of mention. \ He
said that the Pacific Debenture Company
was one of four things. It was either an
insurance company, an investment com
pany,, a- lottery or a fraud. These con
clusions, he said, he had reached through
a summing up of the evidence introduced
in the case. Gavin' McNab. who repre
sented the company, objected to ex-Gov
ernor Budd'n remarks, and the latter drew
on a further objection t>y stating that as
Mr." McNab could not vote proxies he
would doubtless bo worsted In the argu
ment. Judge Miirasky adjourned. the case
for further argument. â¢ . â¢
A SJorguay merchant. Mr. Peterson,
senior partner of the firm of Peterson &
Co.. is ln the city and has called upon sev
eral leading merchants, trying to per
suade them that the interests of San
Francisco would be largely promoted by
running steamers from this port direct to
Skaguay. The argument that he has em
ployed Is that Skaguay Is the gateway
to a country that make3 large demands
for, manufactured and food protVucts. can
ned goods and the like, and that there
are twenty steamers running from Puget
Sound to Skaguay direct, and none from
San Francisco.
Mr. Peterson also says that the mer
chants at Skaguay would prefer to trade
with San Francisco, for the reason that
there are larger stocks of goods in this
city to select from, and there are other
conveniences to be considered.- The sub
ject may be brought up before the San
Francisco Board of Trade and also be
fore the Chamber of Commerco for con
sicleratlon after the Fourth.
A. C. Rulofson of Baker & Hamilton,
who has talked with Mr. Peterson. sav3
that the outlook for San Francisco to get
a profitable business in Skasruay appears
to be very good, if the facilities can b*
provided. The business that Puget Sound
does with the country tributary to Skas
uay is large and profitable.

FOURTH OF JULY
COMMITTEE HAS
ENDED LABORS
Captain Atwood Was Dangerously 111
and There Was No One Left
Aboard to Navigate
the Ship.
Â»
. The four-masted barkentine Kncore has
had an eventful voyage from the nitrate
ports. For thirty-two days the captain
has been sick with heart trouble and kid
ney disease, and the navigation of the
ship was left to the mate, who depended
on luck to reach port safely.
The British l>ark Brussels was spoken
in latitude 32 north, longitude 132 west,
and that vessel did everything possible
under the circumstances. The captain
went aboard the PIncore and not only gave
the mate his sailing course, but doctored
the master of the vessel to the best of
his ability. Captain Atwood was taken
sick a month after the hark left Junin,
and from that time on he has had a tight
with death. Karly yesterday morning the
Encore was at anchor off Point Montara,
and no one seemed to know just where she
was. The tug Reliance was sent out and
picked her up a short distance below the
Cliff House. The Encore left Junin sixty
live days ago, and the passage was an un
eventful one until Captain Atwood was
taken .sick. She brings 794S bags of nt
trate for this port.
Captain Atwood was formerly on the
Webfoot, and later was master of the
Puritan. Before that he was mate of the
ship St. Francis when she was burned to
the water's edge during her trip from
San Francisco to New "Vork.
Disasters in the Arctic.
Particulars of the wrecks in the Arctic
during the rush to Nome are just begin
ning to reach the city. Private lettera to
The Call give the following accounts of
the loss of the barks Alaska and Hunter
and the schooner Eclipse.
The whaling bark Alaska, after making an
exceedingly Rood run of forty-el^ht days from
San Francisco, dropped anchor off Anvil City
I at 10:20 a. m. on June 5, thus beating all the
large steamer?. On the morning of June 7,
about 2 o'clock, It besan to Mow a (tale from
the "southeast. It wns the first storm of the
season and was a. corker. Anchored about a
mile oft Fhore was the revenue cutter Bear,
steamer Cleveland, tug Mary D. Hume, bark
Alaska and schooner Louisa D. The Louisa D.
put cut to eea. as Boon a.i the gale came up
I and the steamers at once bÂ«"Ban ptoamlnjr up
to their anchors. The Alaska held on, how-
I ever, and went ashore. Her anchors were in
the quicksands and hardly had th* first blast
struck her when she began to drift.
In a. few seconds the ensign union down
â¢was fiyinj? In the rigging and the Mary I>.
I Hume went to her assistance. In her efforts
to Fave the hark the tug was nearly lost. Cap
tain Cogan of the Alaska. peolnB that all hope
was srone. ordered the marts out away. This
waf quickly done, and when about 200 yards
from the beach the Kirk took ground In an al
most dismantled condition. There were still
fifteen passengers aboard and as the seas
made c!e:in br<"!irhf>K over her they were ln a
j moot uncomfortable position. Luckily the
â¢ storm went dÂ«wn ihe nest dny nnd all hands
I wore cm off, hut the birk is a total Iobs.
The purpor of the Nome City, writing
und^r date of June 17, says:
On the morninK of the ISth we were boarded
by the steam launrh from the bark Hunter.
Tlie crew rrriortM the Iors of the vessc-1 anil
advised us that thirty people, were Rphore, at
Cape Roumanzlno.fr. about 100 miles from St.
Lawrence Island, and asked us to render as

arriving .it the cape found that not only were
the crew of the Hunter there but also the men
from in* schooner ESclipte. Both vessels had
been ni)ir*""1 in the ioe and drifted ash"ore at

John Xellson, steward of the British ship
Manydown. lying at the seawall near the
foot of Ransome street, was held up by
three highwaymen early Friday morning
anrt robbed of his gold watch and $7 In
money.
Neilson was returning: to the ship at 2
a. m., after spending the night uptown
The three robbers, it is thought, followed
I the steward from a house where he had
spent most of the night. -They wore no
masks. One of them covered Neilsoii
with a pistol.
The robbery was reported at the Harbor
police station, but- none of the highway
men has been captured. The stolen time
piece is a valuable one.

NEWS FROM THE
OCEAN AND THE
WATER FRONT
The Barkentine Encore in
Trouble Oif Point
Montara.
Judges Morrow and De Haven concluded
yesterday the hearing of the contempt
proceedings against Federal Quarantine
Officer Dr. Kinyoun. The first witness
was Captain C. Minor Goodall of the
Pacific Coast Steamship Company.
Shortly after the order was issued cit
ing Dr. Kinyoun to show cause why he
should not be punished for contempt, tho
witness called upon Dr. Kinyoun, who
then made the statement that as the
steamers of the witness went three miles
from land when going to and from Eureka
and San Diego they would be required to
have health certificates in order to avoid
being quarantined on their arrival at the
ports of their destination. The witness
had always understood that Dr. KlnyoulT
had Jurisdiction over all the quarantine
oillcers in the State of California. The
steamship company's officers therefore re
quired a certificate trom every person go
ing to Kureka and San Diego.
"There was no discrimination with re
gard to persons?" asked Judge Morrow.
"No sir; none at all," replied Captain
Goodall.
"l'ou understood that . the trouble at
the other end of the voyage was on ac
count of the quarantine instituted at San
Francisco by Kinyoun?" asked Mr. Camp
bell.
On objection being made by Mr. Coombs,
Mr. Campbell explained that he wished
to show that Kinyoun had quarantined
San Francisco and not the State only,
and that he had refused certificates to
Chinese and Japanese.
Captain Goodall in reply said that on
Saturday and Sunday, June 1H and 17, his
company did not carry any Chinese or
Japanese, lie knew, however, that Dr.
Kinyoun had it-sued a certificate for
Japanese to go to Eureka, but he did not
know of his issuing or refusing to issue
any to Chinese.
Dr. Kinyoun was called to the stand
by Mr. Campbell. He denied that he had
ever refused to issue certificates to Chi
nese or Japanese, but at the same time
admitted that he had not given any cer
tiJicates to people of those nationalities.
He had refused to issue certificates to
eight Chinese who came to him with Mr.
Barnard, clerk for Heddy, Campbell &
Metson, and his refusal was based upon
the fact that the applicants had not com
piled with the requisition to show that
they were not suffering from the bubonic
plague or had not been exposed to it.
Jn reply to his questions on that subject
Mr. Barnard said that he did not think
that those Chinese could comply with the
requisition because they had been ln Chi
natown where the plague wa?.
"I am very glad," eaid Dr. Kinyoun to
the court, "that the representatives of
the Chinese Consul admitted to me in tbÂ«
presence of witnesses that the plague did
exist in San Francirco. Captain Goodall
and myself talked about this contempt
case, and in conversation I repeated to
him that 1 did not demand certificates
from him for travel within the limits of
this State, and Captain Goodall remarked
that he understood that. As early as
June 5 Captain Goodall informed me that
he was having some trouble Â¦with the
Japanese Consul about not carrying any
Japanese or Chinese on board the boats
of the company, but that he was not go
in? to carry any Japanese or Chinese on
his boats."
The witness raid further that, on June 7
a Japanese nurse accompanying >Irs.
Wall of Oakland was peremptorily refused
jjftssage to Eureka by tho Pacific Coast
Steamship Company notwithstanding that
Dr. Kinyoun had interceded for the
Japanese.
The witness stated further that he had
at that time indisputable evidence that
the bubonic plague existed in Chinatown
from .March 7 to June 5, and that the
"department" had corroborated the evi
dence that he had introduced.
Clerk Barnard was called as the next
witness and testified that when he called
upon Dr. Kinyoun v.ith ithe eight China
men tho doctor said that they could go
to any part of tho State they chose; that
he would not stop them; that it was not
necessary for them to have health certifi
cates, and that he would not grant them
certificates because they had been in the
lnfectPd district.

KINYDUN'S CASE
WAITS DECISION
OF THE JUDGES
THE ENCORE AT ANCHOR OFF POINT MONTARA.
Judgre Ogden was disqualified from trying the
cafe because he was a water-rate payer;
that for the same reason he had no jurisdic
tion to request another Judge to *it; and
that thiÂ« act In lei^u'-sting the respondent to
sit as JutiKf or th- Superior Court of Ala
tneda County was without jurisdiction, and
that consent of tht? ra:'-ics could not glv? it
validity. As both side? assume that Judge
<'eden nas disqualified to try the case be
cajpe he was a ratepayer, we will assume
that proposition to be true for the purposes
of this ca<". although we are not to be un
dersto<*d a? definitely determining that ques
tion. Neither are we at all inclined to hold
that .Tudre c^d^^. even if disqualified to try
the case. couM not have legally called in the
respondent l0 hear and determine thÂ» case
in question without any request or consent
of t!ie parties, for the constitution provides,
withr.vt any disqualification, that "a Judge
Â«'ourt in any county at the request of the
judge <.f the Superior Court thereof; but it
ir not necessary to consider that proposition
because bere the respondent was called to
try the cast- with the consent and. practi
cally, at the request of the petitioners. This
iÂ« not a case to which the rule applies that
consent cannr-t cive jurisdiction. â¢ â¢ â¢
Had Full Jurisdiction.
In the ca^e at bar the Superior Judce of
Alameda County had full Jurisdiction of
the subject-matter of the action and of the
partifs, and the respondent was a duly
elected and acting Superior Judge, qualified
officially to preside in that court. There whs
n>> disqualification attaching to him per
sonally, and therefore the question whether
consent can confer jurisdiction upon a per
sonally rftpfjualified Judge doen not arise.
Therefore, the petitioners having requested
.Tudjre Ogden to select a Judge, and having
approved the selection which he made and
carrifd his request to the respondent, and
having rrooÂ«>ed<Hi with the hearing of the
case before the respondent without objection
until important matters had been disposed
of, cannot now be heard to repudiate their
c\> n act. We have been referred to no ca*e
where it has been held that a party having
consented to the calling in of a qualified
Judce to preside over a court havinp com
l*?t*nt jurisdiction of the case can in the
midst of the hearing of thf action stop fur
ther p!">"Â»cee,iinrs upon any such suggestion
of the irregularity or invalidity of the man
ner in which he was called in as is made
Jn the cni?e at bar. â¢ â¢ â¢
Nothing in the Point.
The foreeohig: viewa make it unnecessary
to consider the question whether or not
JudRe Oreene. who was free from all color
of disqualification, did also request thÂ»
respondent to act as .fudge of the Superior
Tourt of Alameda County in the case in
question. We pee nothing in the point at
temrted to be made that when Judge Og
dÂ«n sent the dispatch tr> the respondent he
thought that the latter was the person who
Iiad formerly been Attorney General of th<Â»
State. He intended to request the person
Who was Superior .ludjre of the County of
Sacramento, and when the latter appeared
at Oakland to take hla seat as Jud(?e in the
Superior Court there the events which then
to'.k place constituted of themselves a re
quest that the respondent act a* Judgeâ ail
of which was with the additional knowledge
and cnhper.t of counrcl for petitioners.
ResiÂ«ondent had no intimation that he was
objectionable to either party until June 12.
If petitimers. instead of consenting that
respondfnt be called in and really requested
It to.be done, had objected to him before
any proceedings were ha<l In the case, he
would have been free to refuse to act if he
had preferred to take that course, but In
the present condition of the case it would,
no doubt, be somi-what embarrassing for
him to retire without consent of both par
ties. The prayer of the petitioner is denied
and the proceeding is di?ml?fPd.
Change of Venue Suggested.
Chief Justice Beatty, In his concurring
opinion, said:
In this ca^e I consider that Judge Hart
was invited by consent of the rartle.Â«, and
that at all event? it was too late to object
to his acting In the cause after the parties
had voluntarily argued and submitted the
Judte has been Invited to try a cause by a
dis^jualitiPd Judge the remedy for a dlsBat
iFfied litltrant is to move for a change of
venue. If he waives that remedy, if h<" eon
sontK either exi>ressly or impiiedly to the
selection of the Judt;Â» fo invited, he cannot
claim that his trial of the cause is an ex-
coss of jurisdiction.
A rumor was in circulation yesterday
that Attorney R. T. Hayne had received
a letter from Judge Hart intimating that
in the event of his being sustained by the
Supreme Court he would withdraw from
the case. Mr. Hayne. however, said this
report was erroneous and that he had no
such letter. Me had no idea of Judge
Hart's intentions in the premises and
presumed that the case would oome up
before him in the ordinary way. on his
arrival from Sacramento.
HART'S ATTITUDE.
The Judge Not Prepared to Say That
He "Will "Withdraw.
SACRAMENTO, July 2.â Superior Jud^e
E. C. Hart was ?ccn by the correspondent
of The Call to-nigrht soon after the receipt
of a tfl^gram announcing that he had
been sustained in the Oakland. water suit
matter hv the Supreme Court.
"My friends up this way have all ad
â¢r-ised me to stay in the oat=e." said Judge
Hart: "but I am not prepared to say at
this time what I Phall do, and do not care
to discuss the subject until I have seen
the full decision. I do nrjt know what the
Supreme Court has decided. In any event
I shall not determine what my action
shall be until I have had time to con-
Fider the question thoroughly. As It is
now, I am very busy with work ln my
own court."
THE CALL'S
HOME STUDY CIRCLE
THK Suyircme Court decided In an
opinion handed down yesterday that
S-jprricr Judpe E. C Hart of Sacra
mento <!=, under existing oireum
stances. qualiilr-vl io try the case of the
Centra Costa Water Company against the
city of Oakliud. Judge Hart was called
to the bench of the Alamcda court as the
several Superior Judges of that county,
with the exception of Judge Greene, were
disqualified on account of being rate pay
ers for water. Jud&e Greene's calendar
being crowded he couIJ not attend to the
matter. Without protect Judge Hart en
tered -jpea his duties on the Oakland
bench and a number of legal matters
were disposed of by him. Then Robert T.
Hayre, ppccial counsel for the city of
Oakland, raised an objection to Judge
ilart sitting ln the case. As the Sacra
inento Jutigre refused to retire from the
case Attorney Hayne applied to the Su
preme Court for a writ of prohibition to
prevent Judge Hart from trying the case.
The Supreme Court, in denying the peti
tion, Eays that if there had been any
objection to Judge Hart sitting in the
case it should have bten made before he
tv.-is seated or at least before he had in
any way officiated judicially. Having al
lowed the opportunity to pass for so many
days it was too late to make objection at
all". The opinion was by the court and
Chief Justice Beatty wrote a concurring
opinion, ia which he expresses views dif
fering in small parricu'.ars from the one
by the court. In denying the petition the
court says in substance:
Statement of the Case.

EARLY ENGLISH DISCOVERERS AND EXPLORERS
DISCOVERERS AND EXPLORERS OF* M/VIBRIOA.
III.
We are accustomed' to think lightly of
the "discovery" of America, as If as Co
lumbus sighted land, behold, a new con
tinent was made known. A continent,
however, is not revealed in a moment; Its
shores must be coasted before the true
nature of what has been found can be
learned. As a matter of fact, it was an
island off the coast of America that Co
lumbus first saw, and he died believing:
not that he had discovered a new conti
nent, but that he had revealed to Europe
some islands lying close to the shores of
Asia. His aim was to get a short and
easy water route to the markets of Asia.
Had he known that land, stretching thou
sands of miles north and south, blocked
his path we may well believe America
would have been a source of sorrow
rather than joy to the brave explorer. .
The real beginnings of the discovery of
America were made only when the huge
extent of this coast line began to be un
derstood. Many actors and many expe
ditions shared in the work. It was done
chiefly by Spaniards and Portuguese,
often under Italian leaders like Amerigo
Vespucci .and Columbus himself. The
French and the English had very little
part in it. As early as in 1494 the Pope
divided the new regions between Spain
and Portugal, and excluded all other na
tions. The King of England. Henry VII.
was a good Catholic and obeyed the papal
authority. lie ruled over but a small ter
ritory compared with the vast British
empire of to-dayâ over England. Wales
and Ireland, with Calais on the Continent
representing "Greater Britain": hia sub
jects numbered in all probability consid
erably less than 3,00n.000, and his own
throne was continually menaced by par
tisans of the rival house of York. There
were. In fact, many reasons why Henry
VII should simply mind his own business
and leave the new regions to the care
of those who had found them.
We have it on the highest authority
that the love of money Is the root of all
evil. No doubt it is. but the desire for
gain is also the root of the commercial
enterprise that has ministered so much to
human progress. The English were al
ready keen traders, and not likely to sit
idly by while others gained an advantage.
Columbus, it was believed, had found
another trade route to Asia, and
if the. English did not bestir
themselves they would have little
share In the profitable commerce
with the East. John Cabot, a citizen of
Venice, who had traveled in the East and
who for some reason had made his home
in England, succeeded in arousing even
King Henry himself to an Interest in the
matter, and finally, in 1497. was able with
royal approval to sail forth from Bristol
In command of a small ship, and probably
of only one, to find a new route to China.
Spanish agents in England were watch
ing events, and it wa,s necessary that
.Cabot should seek a route not already
forestalled by Spain or Portugalâ so he
sailed out past Ireland Into the west, ex
pecting to reach China In due course.
We know well enough what Cabot would
encounter and what disappointment was
in store, for thousands of miles not only
of Fea but land lay there to block the
route to Asia. The mysterious unknown
has, however, its own fascination, and
we need not pity the men under the spell
of this potent charm. It would be a
strange spectacle in these days to see an
English crew under an Italian captain.
The Italians were, however, the best ma
riners of that age. Cabot reached land;
whether it was Newfoundland or Cape
Breton or Labrador that he first saw we
do not know, nor need we take special
pains to Inquire. He raised the flag of
England and claimed the country for
Henry VII. Along the coast for many
days he sailed, saw when he landed from
time, to time snares for game, trees felled
and other traces of human habitation, but
met not a human being, nor apparently
did he wish to. His force was small and
the temper of the natives would be un
certain. Soon he turned homeward, had
a quick voyage and was back in England
three months after leaving it.
Cabot's return, with the report of the
new territory he had reached, created the
same kind of interest in England that
Stanley's journey through darkest Africa
aroused ten years ago. Every one talked
about it; the King gave Cabot a pension'
of Â£10 and ultimately a pension of
Â£20, which was not illiberal, for it was
quite equal to $1000 a year In our own
dav. Cabot himself assumed the swagger
of a naval hero. They called him the ad
miral, and he made lavish gifts of ter
ritories in the newly discovered regions.
His barber was promised the lordship of
an island and some of his priestly friends
bishoprics.
All this bright promise came to little.
Cabot ' made a new voyage In 140S. So
little authentic knowledge have we that
it is not certain whether his son Sebas
tian went with his father on either the
first or second voyage. Again Cabot
reached land and apparently sailed far
south of any point- he had visited pre
viously, but he soon found his way back
to England, and was still drawing his
pension in 1109. When he died we do not
know. Sebastkin, his son, lived for more
than half a cviitury after, and is accused
of telling fanmstic tales to later genera
tions about hiq own exploits in those voy.
ages westward and of stealing his
father's laurels. The Cabots did little to
ward the discovery of America; they
made no settlements, opened up no trade.
Their work, however, isÂ« Interesting as
the pioneer effort upon which was based
the subsequent English claim to North
America, which .lime has so fully justi
fied to the Anglo-Saxon race.
Spain was quick to protest against Ca
bot and all his works. Henry VII was
soon busy with plans to marry his son
to Catherine of Aragon. the daughter of
the Spanish sovereigns. Ferdinand and
Isabella., and had no desire to quarrel.
Then Henry VIII came to the throne and
quickly stirred Europe to its depths by
his assault upon the church's power. Oc
casionally adventurous Englishmen tried
to find a passage to Asia by passing
through North America, but without suc
ce*"< It began to be whispered that Asia
might be easier reached by sailing, not
to the west, but along the north coast
of Europe, eastward. Englishmen tried
It in 1525 and failed. More than a quar
ter of a century later, in 1553. they tried
it again, opened up trade with Russia,
wrought in* reality better than they had
planned, but found no sea route to Asia.
In America meanwhile the English did
nothing, and nearly three-quarters of a
century after Cabot's voyages English
men had no footing in the New World.
Henry \ III begarr the quarrel with the
Roman church. His daughter Elizabeth
continued the strife to the death. Within
five years after Elizabeth tame to thÂ»
throne, in 15."^. it was inevitable that
Protestant England and Roman Catholic
Spain were to be the respective champions
of two bitterly hostile parties, anil many
were eager to appeal as soon as possible
to the sword in settlement of the struggle.
Hawkins and Drake assailed Spain In
I America, and the story of their exploit. 5 ?
reads like a fairy tale. The scene was in
the southâ we shall come to It presently;
but meanwhile we look at what England
still tried to do in the north.
When the early explorers, to their
amazement. found that solid land
stretched northward and southward in
definitely and that the route to Asia was
blocked the idea grew that as the Ian!
seemed never to end a channel which
might reach from ocean to ocean must be
sought. Magellan found in the south such
a tortuous channel, now known as the
straits of Magellan, and sailed through
into the Pacific Ocean. He believed that
south of this channel the land stretched
away* indcflnitely-a belief that Drake waa
to disprove later by discovering Cape
Horn, with the Illimitable sea to the east.
west and south. Magellan's stormy straits
were soon disused as too full of peril.
Some still dreamed of a better passage a:
the far north. Jacques Cartier in 1535
sailed up the St. Lawrence, hoping that he
might in some way get through to China.
He failed, of course, and gave up; then
forty years later the English again took
up the task that Cabot had failed to ac
complish. It is a story of heroic effort
continued for well nigh 300 years, to be
successful only in our own age.
Martin Frobisher made the new start.
Beginning about 1360. he urged the search
for a northwest passage, and after long
years the attempt- was made. Frobisher
led. in 1376, the first of three successive
voyages to the north. Drake at the same
time was struggling in the south to follow
Magellan into the Pacific, and did it. Fro
bisher was a skillful seaman, a firm ruler.
"verie valiant, but withal harsh and vio
lent." Like other English seadogs of the
time, he was deeply religious, and pious
phrases then found a use which we should
deem irreverent. "Before the world was
God" was the challenge he once gave his
sentries, and the answer was to he. "After
God came Christ, his sonne." Queen Eliz
abeth took a deep interest in his plans. A
joint stock company was formed, with the
Earl of Warwick aa chief mover, and
among .the heavy shareholders were the
Queen and the leading courtiers of the
day. In the far north Frobisher found a
narrow passage which looked like a chan
nel similar to Magellan's, but proved to
be only a long, deep bay, now i.amed after
its English discoverer. He found, what
excited him even more, on one of the bar
ren islands a black stone that seemed
heavily charged with gold. Back to Eng
land he hurried. It was gold, some who
ought to know said, and next year Fro
hlsher went again to the north with a
larger company, determined to abandon
the search for a route to Asia and con
tent to carry back to England all the
precious ore he could find.
The natives, whom we know as the Es
kimos, proved troublesome. Some men
were killed on both sides. The English
found the country, as they said, more
ready to eat them than to give them to
eat. They saw and described icebergs
with torrents of -water pourtng down their
sides, dogs drawing sledsâ a sight to them
apparently strangeâ and many other note
worthy things. Above all. they found more
precious ore. loading their ships with hun
dreds of tons of it and went back to Eng
land rejoicing. A third time. In 1573. Fro
bisher returned, with no less than fifteen
ships, gathered still more ore and went
home, to find In the end that It contained
.little or no gold, to be himself plunged fnr
a time Into deep poverty and to have some
trouble in forcing shareholders who had
subscribed funds to pay up. The search
for the northwest passage thus end-d for
the time in a scramble for gold. Our own
age has seen Incredible quantities of gold
found in America In the same latitude, but
the valley of the Yukon, which empties its
waters into the Pacific, was to prove tho
real El Dorado.
Frobisher had sailed through what we
know as Hudson Straits, and he added
something to the knowledge of the north
ern coasts of America. lie lived to servo
his country In other ways â to fight with
Drake against the great Spanish Armada.
John Davys In 15S5, 15S5 and 1387. with
slight means but in a heroic spirit, voy
aged Into the same northern seas, but
failed In his main object. Hla name, how
ever, is not yet forgotten in connection
with the far north.
The English had meanwhile secured thÂ«
one piece of territory which they acquired
permanently In America In the sixteenth
century. Newfoundland had Ions been a
rendezvous for fishermen from all the
coasts of Europe, but as yet it belonged
definitely to no European power, though
more than ore claimed It. Sir Humphrey
Gilbert, one of the noblest spirits of thÂ«
century, high in favor at court, led In 13v5
an expedition to Newfoundland. The fear
of Spain or of Portugal was no longer be
fore the minds of the Knglish. Drake had
dared to raise the English flair even In thÂ«
Pacific. England was powerful upon thÂ«*
seaâ much stronger than Spainâ though
the world still thought otherwise. In New
foundland, with much ceremony. Gilbert
proclaimed Elizabeth sovereign of thÂ«
country and declared that he -would shear
off the ears and do other terrible things
to any one who dared speak disrespect
fully of her. He perished on his way
homeward and died as a brave Christian
should. Calais had been lost In thÂ« - reijrn
of Mary, and Newfoundland was the flrjt
and only region outside the mother Isles
over which the English flag waved In any
thing- like security while Elizabeth
reigned. Nor was the tenure of New
foundland safe. The French for more
than a century disputed, not without suc
cess, the English ownership. It was In thÂ»
north of America that the English were
to do their mightiest work of colonization.
Such a future would have seemed Incredi
ble enough when Elizabeth died, In 1603.
New England was not yet. From the Arc
tic Ocean to Mexico reigned a cheerless
and cruel barbarism practically untouched
by Europe, though these coasts had been
known for a hundred years. The Spaniards
had. however, done something consider
ably farther south. What the English did
against them we shall see In the next
paper.

may not be for several days. But the bidding
up of prices to-day represented the effort of
professionals to anticipate the coming pressure
for reinvestment. In fact, the whole movement
was largely in professional hands, the advance
being accomplished on a small volume of busi
ness and with the obvious Intention of Improv
ing the- level of prices rather than of securing
stocks as cheaply as pcÂ«Â«lble. The steel stocks
were strong In the early dealings in spite of the
news of the continued decline in prices of
product and the widespread closing down of
mills pending the adjustment of wage sched
ules. There was also a reaction la the price
of pig lead. The metal stocks generally did
not hold their best prices. The same was true
of coalers. Sugar was comparatively quiet
and was Inclined to react from the high price.

CHICAGO. July 2.â Wheat, bearlshly affected
by rains In the Northwest, weakness In Liver
pool and the heavy deliveries tn July contracts,
closed 3%c lower to-day. Corn closed *i?5*ic
and Oats l'.4c down. Provisions closed steady.
I August Wheat opened lttc, deliveries In July
] contracts unusually heavy, although largely
by one elevator concern, and. there were liberal
I rains In the Northwest. These were the fac
tors throughout the session. The rains In the
Dakotas and Minnesota were heavier than pre
vious showers of a month. Following the open-
Ins: there was some covering by shorts, which
rallied August to S0%c. but thereafter the
I course was downward with few checks and
! these were not emphatic. Toward the end the
I elevator concern credited with most of the
i deliveries was credited with hammering the
market to enable it to rebuy stuff given out
on July contracts. The close was weak at the
bottom. August 3%c lower than Saturday at
77*^. New York reported twenty-five loads
] taken for export.
Corn opened off sharply with wheat, and al
! though the market recovered its initial decline
I the close showed some loss with .wheat. Rains
I in the West, together with the wheat weak-
I ness, caused selling at the start by commls
| slon houses. On the break Influential local op
erators bought and provisions people covered,
causing the bulge. Country acceptances were
reported small. The cash demand was fair.
Oats were weak. Influenced by 'the wheat
break and a favorable crop report from the
Northwest. This section, recently a buyer,
was on the other side to-day.
Provisions early were firm and especially In
comparison with the weakened attitude of
wheat, showing but a small decline. The list
I eased off a little early, but rallied later on
I good local support. Towards the end the mar
ket eased oft again with wheat, but the close
was steady. â¢Â¦"â¢' Â¦

London Market.
NEW YORK. July 2.â Commercial Advertis
er's London financial cablegram:
The markets here were depressed to-day un
der the news from China and dealings were on
a small scale and altogether in the hands of
professionals.
Americans were sold in the belief that Ber
lin would unload on account of the New York
fire, which It was thought would disturb Ger
man industrials anew. When It was discovered
that Germany was not inclined to sell much
the market rallied, stimulated by the news
that the drought In the Northwestern wheat
fields In America had been broken.
The bank sold Â£5S.O00 gold in French coin
and lost Â£20,000 to Roumanla.
CLOSING.
Money was very easy considering the half
yearly settlements' and the large amount due
the bank was entirely repaid. Silver was
weak, bazaar prices declining. The Exchange
will be closed on Saturday.
The fortnightly statistics of copper show that
there has been virtually no change since the
last report.

New York Metal Market.
NEW YORK. July 2.â In a general way the
metal market was very weak. The demand for
plglron was most unsatisfactory and prices
were nominal at any figure; warrants at the
close quoted $14. Lake copper was also neg
lected but nominally unchanged: closed quiet
at $16 50. The demand for tin was no match
for the disposition to sell and prices ruled
lower, with the market finally dull and nomi
nal on the basis of $31. Lead was decidedly
unsettled, closing weak and low at $4 1004 15.
against $4 22H<ff4 27H last week. Spelter, with
out quotable change, was quiet, closing at
$4 25^4 30. The brokers' price for lead Is $3 90
and for copper $10 DO.
New York Cotton Market.
NEW YORK, July 2.â In view of the decline
of 19 to 20 points, which occurred in the New
York cotton market ' Saturday, a recovery at
Liverpool after a lower opening became the
ba?is of some buying here on the opening call,
which resulted tn an advance of 8 to 22 points
on the near position and 2 to 7 points on later
deliveries. A reaction followed and the mar
ket closed barely steady at a net decline of
4 to 9 points.
U^ew York TDrv Goods {Market.
NEW YORK. July 2.â The tone of the market
shows firmness In brown cottons In some quar
ters, manufacturers being influenced by the
continued rise In the price of cotton. There Is
no better demand than before In any direction,
business bring on a limited scale throughout.

NHW YORK. July ;.â With thÂ» exception of
a brief period of depression at the opening In
rympathy wltSl torden quotations the etock
rr.arket was COMtStenUr strong throughout the
day and closf-d with th* pains well maintained
In nearly all eases. While the strength was
pretty well diffused the Grangers and Pacifies
Â¦rent the leadrrÂ» at thf market both in point
of activity and strength. The news of rains
lÂ»oth on Sunday and to-day in the spring wheat
TÂ»pion was the principal factor in the advance,
us it was in the decline j -i the wheat market.
The weekly natii-Ucs of grain traffic received I
from Chicago emphasized the influence of the
news of the crop conuit'.rn. The deliveries of
Grain at Chicago showed a *tlll further in
crease ovw last v.eekV total and at G. 236.000
Lushcls were the largost <if the corresponding
iret-k In over five years, with the excoptionjof
last year, from which the laiilng oS was about
CJ per cent. The receipts r.t primary points i
FhoweJ only a ema!! decline from last week's |
larpc- arrri-gaie. The willingness thus fhown
by the farn:cn= to part with their wheat at
present prices sterns Bimewhat to discredit the
alanr.'.st it-port of the prcepectirc shortness of
the wheat crop.
The figures of the Isrre J-j!y disbursements
of dividends and Interact were 'another factor
of strength in the market. These are esti
mated variously at J100.000.Wt to IUO.000,000. It
If pointed out that a larger proportion than
ever before of these payments will remain in
thle country, owing to the large buying of
American securities from the margined holders
during the past year. There was no effect ap
parent in the money market from these <3Is
bucsemenu and, according to precedent there

E. J. Becker Receives Nine Wounds.
but None Is Considered to Be
Dangerous.
E. J. Becker, bartender in the Louvre,
Powell and Eddy streets, met with an
ugly customer early yesterday morning
In the person of Joseph Breseneo. a Mexi
can porter. Breseneo entered the saloon
about 6 o'clock and asked for a glass of
beer. Becker told him that he did not
sell any liquor till 7 o'clock and the Mexi
can became abusive, calling Becker all
sorts of vile names. Becker stood his
abuse as long as he could, and stepped In
front of the bar to put Breseneo out As
he did so Breseneo made a pass at the
bartender's face. Becker sidestepped and
landed on Breseneo's Jaw, but slipped ana
fell.
Breseneo jumped on top of Becker, and.
pulling a knife out of his pocket, slashed
at his face and body. Becker succeeded
In throwing him off, and he ran for the
door. Becker caught him and held him
by the wrists till two men came to his
assistance. Policeman Keyes was sent for
and Breseneo was taken to . the City
Prison, where a charge of assault to mur
der was booked against him. The knife
was held as evidence.
Becker was taken to the Receiving Hos
pital, where It was found that he had
been cut nine times. There was a cut In
his nose, one In his left eyelid, one an
Inch to the right of the left nipple, three
In the left side, one In the left shoulder
and two In the left side of the back. They
are not dangerous, but Becker lost con
siderable blood.
. Breseneo appeared In Judge Mogan's
court, yesterday morning. As no com
plaint was on file the case was continued
until July 9.

Captain Seymour noticed a dispatch In
the papers from Cleveland on June 11
about the arrest, and suspecting that the
man was Bain communicated with the
Cleveland authorities and forwarded a
photograph. He received a photograph of

sure enough. It was Bain's.
A photograph of a woman who has.

Ruby Bennicker Seriously Injured in
First Accident on Sansome-
Street Line.
Little Ruby Bennicker, a child 7 years
of age, residing at 221 Broadway, met with
a pitiful accident yesterday afternoon.
The little one was struck by an electric
car and had both legs crushed. One of
them was amputated by the Receiving
Hospital surgeons, and the physicians
have only a slight hope of saving the
other. " The remarkable feature of the ac
cident was the wonderful endurance dis
played by the Injured child before and
after she had been placed on the operat
ing table. V v
Ruby, In company with Irene Trucco.
another girl about her own age, started
to cross bansome street, wnen their
progress was stopped by two electric cars
coming from opposite directions. The
child who received the terrible injuries
was warned not to attempt to pass over
the tracks, but she paid no heed to the
warning. The car running in the direction
of Market street was almost upon her,
and she jumped back on the other track
to save herself. Hardly had she done so
when the northbound car. No. 1113. felled
her, and before it could be stopped the
heavy wheels had passed over her legs.
Motorman P. Demara was immediately
arrested and charged with battery.
The fact that the car that crushed the
child was laboring up a steep hill at the
time of the accident led many to believe
the motorman could have stopped sooner,
but eye-witnesses all agree that the thing
was done in the twinkling of an eye.
and that no blame should be placed upon
the employe. After the Injured child was
gicked tin she displayed unusual courage,
he never lost consciousness, and sub
mitted to the operation with wonderful
grit. The physicians are unable to state
whether or not she will survive her in
juries. The accident was almost similar
in character to that which maimed liAle

Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
HIS Broadway, July 2.
A steam macadamizing roller at work
on Kennedy street in East Oa.kland ran
over and crushed to death little BIrdio
Louise Huhs, the six-year-old daughter
of Henry Huhs of Kennedy street, this
afternoon.
George A. Cook, the engineer of the ma
chine, came to the police station this
evening and surrendered himself. He
was charged with manslaughter and re
leased on his own recognizance.
The street at the point where the ac
cident occurred is being macadamized by
the Standard Improvement Company. The
big roller has been a constant source of
amusement and Interest to the children
of the neighborhood. Engineer Cook says
that to this fact Is due the death of the
little girl. Just before the hour for stop
ping work this evening Cook says that
he stopped the roller for a moment, arid
the children, thinking he was going ahead
crowded about the rear. He reversed the
engine and the little girl was caught un
der the roller and her llffi crushed out.
The little brother of the dead girl says
that ho and his sister were riding on the
back of the roller and that when the
engine was reversed the shock threw her
off under the roller.
"I did not know that an accident had
happened," said the engineer, "until tho
little girl had passed under the roller.
Then the shouts and cries of the children
about the machine attracted my atten
tion, and I saw that I had run over one
of them and crushed her to death. It
was a terrible shock to me. but I saw
that the little one was already dead. I
have been apprehensive that there might
be an accident ever since I have been at
work there. I did not see the accident
and could not have done so, because the
roller was going backward at the time."

Touches on Women's Clubs by Way
of Preface to Lecture on
"The Novel."
Henry Austin Adams made a last refer
ence to the women's clubs controversy at
the beginning of his lecture on "The
Novel" at Metropolitan Temple last night,
and being accused of Idealism quoted Nik
ola Tesla, the materialist, in support of
his position.
"My correspondence for the last few
days." the lecturer said, "has been very
interesting. I have here letters from
eleven physicians who thank me for what
1 have said and offer me assistance in the
way of details. One lady writes that the
trouble with mo is that I am a churchman
and cannot take a scientific view of the
situation. Last night I was reading Nik
ola Tesla in the June Century- Now. he
Is materialistic and scientific enough to
satisfy my correspondent, and here is
what "he says In that article: 'The society
life, modern education and pursuits of
women, tending to draw them away from
their household duties and make men out
of them, must needs detract from the ele
vating ideal they represent, diminish the
artistic creative power and' cause sterillty
and a general weakening of the race." "
The lecture was given for the benefit of
the Francesca Training School, connected
with St. Ignatius Church, and the Temple
was crowded.

Yesterday P. H. Prenderg-ast went to Sac

State*! office a petition of the Fourth Con
gressional District Committee for a place
upnn the official ballot. The Call's in
formation Is to the effect that Kelly and
irimmlns want u convention composed of
<; I'cates other than those who shall be
thosen to the State Convention from that
district. In other words, the bosses want
a separate convention. The fact that Kelly
erl Crirr.mins want something of this
k';: d is sufficient proof that a scheme, cor
r - :;>t and vile, !s contemplated.
The petition, which contains the usual
clause for holding a Congressional con
venlion; was received yeFterday by Dep
uty Secretary of State Hoesch. but was
i ot ni*-<i. Charles K. Curry. Secretary of
Ftatc. being in San Francisco when the
I clition was presented, was not fully ad
vised of its contents. It makes no differ
ence, however, what the petition repre

reached the conclusion that the Congrcs-
Fi'.nal committee recently appointed at
h.icramento is not the governing body of
the party in the Fourth District. He
: .. v-fc.r.- that the committee created by

Delegates elected to the State conven

The State commiue was advised yester
day that a petition had been presented for
a separate convention in the Fourth Dis

as no one had heard of a contest In the
Fourth.
Yesterday the Republican State Central
Committee placed in the hands of the
Secretary of State petitions to elect dele

The committee is officially advised thai
separate delegates, to comprise a Con

controversy is so bitter in that district
that settlement outside of the State con
vention is deemed desirable.
The Republican County Commltte will
not meet to-morrow night, but the mem
bers will be called together In ample time
to frame the petition to participate In the
primary election August 14. Revision of
ths mils by residents of each precinct
will be directed by the committee in dis
tricts where complaints of fraud and
bneus enrollments are made. In districts
other than the Twenty-eighth, Twenty
ninth Forty-third and Forty-fifth
Kelly and Crimmins did not make much
of an effort to enroll the riff-raff of the
Mint saloon. Independent Republicans of
the Twenty-ninth assert that they will be
able to down the bosses at the primary
election. There is a strong and growing
sentiment In the committee against any
form of compromise with Kelly and Crim
mins.
pate in the Coming Primary
Election.
Republicans File Petitions to Partici-
PROGRESS OF CAMPAIGN "WORK
there is no contest and no elgrn of one.
The Inference is that the vile bosses ot
the Mint saloon want to stand up Kahn
anil make him pay In coin or degrading
promises for the nomination. Perhaps
th^re is a scheme hatching to "touch"
tferrfn.
The bossrs. no doubt, apprehend that
the clean, independent Republicans resid
ing in the Fourth District have resolved
to send to the State convention men of
character ami intelliKence. who will not
deprade themselves by taking orders from
Phil Crimmins or Martin Kelly. If a
separate convention be not called dele
gates elected to the State convention from
that district will appoint the Congres-
Flor.al committee or gnvfrninK body of the
district, ami the committee so appointed
will serve for two years. In order tp
cheat the good citizens of the party a
sideshow is proposed by the bosses. In
cJtientally the nominee for Congress will
be "stood up" for as much as he can pro
duce, and then the side convention will
name a committee to stand up some one
else two years hence. If the Secretary of
Pt.ite fails to defeat the scheme bv throw
ing out the Kelly-Orimmins petition the
resolute citizens of the district should
orcanire forthwith and elect anti-boss
delegates to the Congressional district
convention.
Bosses Scheming for Separate
Convention to Nominate Can

War With the Southern Pacific at
Los Angeles Now Being Waged .
in Earnest.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, July 2.â The manage
ment of the Los Angeles Pacific' Electric
Railway has met the cut of the Santa
Fe and the Southern Pacific to Santa
Monica made on Saturday and the war of
rates, if war it is really to be, is now on
in earnest. The new electric tariff is $2
for ten trips or when taken advantage
of by a party of ten. This rate is figured
out to be the same as the rate of, Jl 50
for ten rides, tnjde by the steam roads,
for the reason that ten streetcar fares to
and from the stations of the steam lines
must be deducted in the calculation.
The travel to Santa Monica was un
usually heavy yesterday, the electric
lines obtaining by far the bulk of the
business. The Southern Pacific had issued
an order to cut and slash to all of the
beaches on Saturday, but before the
afternoon was over the command was
rescinded, excepting to Santa Monica.
The Santa Fe's new $1 50 ten-party rate
to Redondo was, however, allowed to
stand. The Terminal has not yet met
the cut of its rivals.
The rate is legally a special or excursion
rate. The railroads having in view the
Southern Pacific's wcent experience in
being enjoined from restoring high rates
through the San Joaquin Valley, between
San Francisco and Fresno, do not intend
in the local slashing of beach fares, to re
peat that experiment.

HEROICALLY SAVES THE
LIVES OF FISHERMEN
Frank Piazoni of Monterey, Alone,
Goes to the Rescue of a Crew
in Danger.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MONTEREY. July 2.â Two fishing boats
of the salmon fleet of this place were
nearly swamped off Chinatown Point dur
ing the heavy gale that prevailed in this
section yesterday. The exertion neces
sary to keep one of the boats afloat would
have proved fatal to three of the boatmen
but for the bravery of Frank Piazoni, who
went single handed to the rescue. -
The fleet was oft the heads when the
blow began. It was impossible to use
sail, and the fishermen were obliged to
row their heavy boats for over three
miles. When passing Chinatown Point
the crews of two of the boats became ex
hausted and attempted to make for the
bell buoy, off the point, intending to tie
up to the buoy until the snuall abated.
The first boat reached the nuoy safely,
but the second, beinp manned by elderly
men, unable to stand the heavy exertion
longer, became unmanageable, and a
heavy- sea that struck it at that moment
filled it with water. Piazoni. from shore,
saw the danger and went to the assistance
of the Imperiled fishermen. After great
exertion he managed to row the boat
ashore. -
FOREST FIRES BREAK OUT
AFRESH IN ARIZONA
Correspondence of Associated Press,
MANILA, P. I., May 2?.â Spanish papers
in Manila declare the Filipino people are
neglecting the opportunities tendered
them for self-improvement. El Comercio
begins an article on this subject by ask
ing, "Why do not the natives of these
islands appreciate the educational efforts
being made in their behalf?' and then
goes on to describe the opportunities for
a good education offered by the Phillipine
Naval Academy and deplores the fact that
not more thasi a dozen applicants have
applied for the very good and thorough
training in theoretical and practical sea
manship, in mathematics, geography and
English offered by this academy at a cost
to the student of the textbooks needed for
the course.
This school was inaugurated by Spain
and is now maintained by the American
Government at public expense. The train
ing given is a valuable one and fits young
men to become officers and engineers in
the coastwise trade between these islands.
The trade has always been large and im
portant, which fact is attested by the
great number of small steamers constant
ly coming and going from Manila, and in
it there is chance tor the employment of
a good many Filipinos. To-day almost all
the officers of these coasting steamers
are Spaniards and owners have frequently
to send to Spain for men to officer their
There has lately been started In Manila
an organization called the "International
Club." Its purposes are varied, butamong
them Is that of sending to the United
States two ybung Filipino men, there to
obtain the best and most thorough educa
tion in civil engineering which "our coun
try affords. All the expenses of this edu
cation will be borne by the club and Its
members have duly informed themselves
of the cost of tuition at Cornell and the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, of
living expenses for a student in Ithaca or
in Boston, and the money for this purpose
is already subscribed or in sight. A few
weeks ago the club announced, through
the local "press and by word of moutn,
that the fortunate youths to receive this
education would be selected by competi
tive examination and now it appears that
just two men came forward to take fed
vantage of the club's'good offer. "What
can be done with such people?" exclaims
El Comerclo. Seeking for a reason to ac
count for this apathy the Spanish com
mentors find it. to a certain extent, in the
recent fad of bicycle riding that has come
to the young Filipinos and in his prefer
ence to dodge around the streets of Ma
nila and the Luneta on a new American
wheel, than to consider seriously the
question of his own future. Bicycle rid
ing, attendance at :he horseraces and
aping the manners of the American dude
are noticeable among the better class. of
youths of Manila. Some call it American
progress and laugh at it, while others call
it the trail of the serpent and deplore It.
With the purpose of preventing the car
ryine of concealed weapon* by civilians in
Manila, the customs authorities have
forced all captains and oflicers of coast
wise steamers to give up their revolvers.
The sailormen objected most strenuously
to this measure, saying that without arm's
they were practically at the mercy of
their Filipino crews while at sea, and they
further complained of the way in which
the authorities disarmed them. A file of
soldiers was sent on board each steamer,
and openly and before the crews made the
officers of the ships give up their arms.
In some cases the crews laughed at this
performance, while in others threats ol
venpeance and of the settlement of old
pcores were instituted among them. Espe
cially was this so on the steamer Escano,
and the owner and captain of this vessel
made most vigorous protest at being dis
armed, but all to no purpose. It is im
possible to buv firearms of any kind in
Manila, so the Escano sailed for the soutn.
ern Islands without any on board except
those surreptitiously possessed by her
Filipino crew. A few days later Manila
was shocked by a story of sudden death
and robberyâ the crew of the Escano had
murdered that vessel's captain, owner and
engineer, scuttled the ship and gone away
In the pullboats with $40,000 in cash to join
the insurgents cr the robbers of the Visa
yan Islands. After this became known an
appeal was made to General MacArthur.
and then the American authorities gave
back their flrearm3 to the Spanish cap
tains and mates of the coastwise steamers
clearing from Manila, and allowed each
man six rounds of ammunition. The mur
ders on the Escano and the successful es
cape, of the. murderers had a disquieting
effect upon the native crews of all coast
wise steamers. They talked the matter
over, spoke also of the case of the steam
er Coir.pania de Filipinos, whose crew mu
tinied and murdered her officers and were
never punished (this was in Admiral
Dewey's lime), and matters finally got po
threatening and uneasy that last week the
captains of several ships In the bay ap
proached their employers and refused to
take their ships to sea unless a guard of
American soldiers was placed on board
each vessel. Whereupon the shipowners,
remembering how the Spanish Govern
ment had once furnished guards for ves
sels trading through the Visayan Islands
under similar circumstances, asked the
American authorities to guard the lives
of their Spanish employes and their prop
erty from attack by Filipino crews while
their vessels were on the high seas. This
the authorities declined to do. and as the
captains of four vessels still firmly refuse
to sail unless afforded protection against
the possible uprising of their crews. thesÂ«
ships are at present tied up in Manila Bay
awaiting come action in the matter. Ship
owners have asked the authorities to al
low them to place armed men, not sol
diers, on board their vessels at their own
expense. If the authorities will permit
this all will be well, but If not the strike
threatens to become general among the
steamers not used in carrying Government
property out of Manila. Upon the latter
vessels the authorities always place a
guard for the protection of their property
which Ruard also serves to keep order
among the crew.

TO ACT IN THE EAST
Fireworks in the Western Addition.
A grand display of fireworks Is to be
given at the Chutes on the evening of the
YET another Californian actress Is
going East to conquer. Laura
Crews, the charming ingenue of
the Alcazar, has received a most
flattering offer to join the forces of the
Murray Hill Theater stock company In
BrooWyn and play a line of ingenue parts.
Mips Crews has closed the contract and
will open her season on the 25th of next
September. Â»
While young In years. Miss Crews has
had enough stage experience to fit her
for the most responsible parts. Her debut
was made with Frederick Warde. She
was then 4 years old and retains a vivid
recollection I of the terror , the Â¦ tragedian's
sonorous voice inspired in , her. In fact,
she was caried off the* stage, howling.
Soon, however, her: fear wore away and
thereafter she was one | of the hits Â¦ of I tho
show. A season with Joseph Grlsmer 'and
Phoebe Davies followed, the young actress
scoring hca-.-irys.as Edltha in ','Edltha's
Burgler," and - the baby in "Bottles
Baby." Miss Crews then left the- boards
to receive her education. She . graduated
from the San. Jose Normal School in 1898.
An engagement /was obtained at the Al
cazar, and Â¦Â¦: there by dint ! of : sheer, -hard
work : the young actress has gained . a
footing which will . put her In the front
rank of her profession. Her most con
spicuous successes have been as Rose Van
Buren in the "Charity Ball," Kitty Itfes
In "The Wife," ;; Wilbers -Anne in "The
Girl I Left - Behind Me": and as Sue In
Bret Harte's play of that name.
Before she leaves for tho East Miss
Crews is to : receive a testimonial of her
popularity in the i shape of a grand benefit
matinee â¢ at the, Alcazar. The, perform
ance will be given under the auspices of
the > pupils of the / Girte' High School,
which. Miss. Crews attended.: The; Alcazar
has* turned out j many good actresses, but
never : one ; of . whom .. it . has more 1 reason to
beproud of than its present ingenue.

The Gallant Captain.
Captain Hansen is a master mariner,
just now without a ship. He has known
Mrs. Le Blanche, who was formerly Cath
erine Turley. fcr several years, and was
engaged to be married to her when she
became the wife of Henry Le Blanche,
Until ten days ago he had been absent on
a voyape for fifteen months. He says that
he pVomised Le Blanche eighteen months
ago that he would not have anything to
do with his wife, and would have kept
his promise if she had not come to visit
him. L. '
Le Blanche is a pudgy Frenchman,
about jO years old. and has lived here
twenty-five years, keeping restaurants in
â¢ various parts of the city. He seems to
consider that he has done right In shoot
ing his wife, although on the advice of his
attorney, Z. U. Dodge, he refuses to talk
of the matter.
-It was Dodge who secured the employ
ment of Curtin to secure evidence in a
suit for divorce brought by Mrs. Le
Blanche and now pending. Le Blanche
has had two former wives. One of them
died and the other Is In an insane asylum.,
Mrs Le Hlanche is about 25 years old
and quite pretty. She was employed in Le
Blanche's restaurant as cashier for ten
months prior to her marriage. She says
she was induced by her brother, Patrick
Turley. a student, and a married sister
to marry Le Blanche because the French
man had a good business. Now she re
grets that she did not marry Hanse^n. She
Fays that Le Blanche was such a brute
that she was obliged to leave' him at the
end of the first week and has only lived
with him at intervals since.
Fourth, and, as it will be the only public
display in that district, the management
have exerted themselves to contract for
the finest show of its kind ever given at
that resort. The features of the night
will be a pyrotechnic water fountain and
a large * reproduction of the battleship
Oregon firing a volley. Ample accommo
dations are being provided for the large
crowd expected.
THE woman with a past, of whom
we have heard so much of late, is the
main subject of Carton's five-act
drama, "The Tree of Knowledge,"
presented last n'ght at the Columbia The
ater The author has thrown no new light
upon this trite subject, the possibilities of
which have been almost exhausted by
Dumas fils and Pinero, but he has. by
skillful rearrangement of old material,
succeeded In writing two or three scenes
that are theatrically effective and that
give far better opportunities to Mr. Mil
ler's company than did the farce presented
last week. â
. In "The Second Mrs. Tanqueray the
hero (If so he may be called) knowingly
marries a courtesan; in Carton's play he
unknowingly does the same. This woman
had been the mistress of the hero s friend.
Sho soon tires of her huaban d, Â«J <**_"
tempts to run away with a third man.
The friend threatens to kill her If she
docs so, acting on the somewhat odd pre
sumption that the hero's honor will be
saved by his continuing to live with, a
wife whom he has good reasoivto belie-i e
unfaithful. Despite the friends attempt
the lady" succeeds in running away with
the' third man, and the heroâ well, he
drops out of sight altogether in the last
act, leaving us to conjecture only that ne
lived a sadder and a wiser man.
This main plot is illfitted to a minor
plot, wherein the friend professes him
self unable m the first act to marry the
srirl he now loves, but finds himself quite
able to do so in the fifth act. Yet his re
lation to her has remained absolutely un
changed throughout the play.
We have also the old mechanical device
of the repeated overheard conversation,
whereby the villain is to be baffled, ana
.the usual .comic relief of the old man in
love with the ingenue. The exposition of
the first act is unnecessarily long, as Is
also the resolution of the fifth act. A
play that tells so threadbare a story as
this should not be allowed to detain an
audience in the theater until a quarter
before twelve. .
With all Its defects the play, as I have
said, contains some strong scenes, notably
that in the third act between Brian (Mr.
Miller and Nigil (Mr. Morgan), and that
in the fourth act between Belle (Miss
Martinot) and Nigil. Miss Martinot's
acting was a delight to behold; it com
bined ease with strength, clearness with
rapidity. Mr. Morgan, whose reappear
ance was loudly welcomed, played with
that absolute sincerity which Is his strong
est feature; Mr. Worthing, as a blase man
of the world; and Mr. Findlay, as a comic
gardener, were capital in their respective
lines; Mr. Miller, who was in much bet
ter voice than last week, generously sank
himself In a subordinate part that gave
him but one good opportunity, but that
he improved rarely. But Miss Anglin was
the surprise of the evening. This is the
first time to my remembrance that she
has ever played an ingenue part In San
Francisco; she certainly did it with in
effable sweetness and .grace. If I have
ever thought or said that she was good
only in hard, brilliant characters. I take
ft back. L. DU PONT SYLE.
Grand Opera-House.
Last night the new Frawleys made their
first appearance at the Grand Opera-house
In the much-talked of "Children of , the
Ghetto," dramatized .from the book by
its author, Israel Zangwill.
"The Children of the Ghetto" is a good
book, all but a great-' book. The play,
with the exception of the third act. Is
poor, and perhaps that is the fault of the
dramatist. In every act but the afore
mentioned third the brand of the novice Is
roughly apparent. - The first is complete
in Itself, the curtain falling upon a happy
ending that might fittingly have closed a
one-act play,, leaving, no element of sus
pense or expectation to prolong the Inter
est - The. action "Is" too compressed, the
situation unconvincing. It is found that
a mock marriage, made in jest between
the daughter of "Reb" Shemuel and the
betrothed of her friend, is binding "by the
laws of Moses."
At the discovery there Is expressed nei
ther sufficient sense of the seriousness of

the "Night and a Day" than the usual

the players do not neglect. The next thing
on the California bill Is "A Contented

The Chutes has a good bill this week.
The programme Includes Hadley and

Rosabel Morrison Is a surprise and dis
tinct pleasure as the Rabbi's daughter.
Hannah Jacobs. She shows the schooling
of her clever father and some little amus
ing resemblances to Florence Roberts' use
of voice, eyes and -a delicate finish and
restraint. She also evinces emotional
power. Henry Roberts as David Bran
don played a manly part in manly iasn
ion. and though his work shows yet some
little lack of finish, there is plenty of
good material to work upon. 'Pinchas,
the poet, the principal comedy interest of
the play, was splendidly played by Wal
lace Shaw, and Phosa McAllister was an
entirely admirable Malka. Little Miss
Muffetâ no, Duffet. is a charming little

as to bring down the house. The rest of

Mr Lackaye made a neat little speech,
thanking the audience for Its appreciation
The stage management left much to be
desired. Walts were very long and the
final curtain was rung down but shoitly
before 12 o'clock^
Marie Stuart, not Queen of Scots, but
queen of soubrettes, is the fascinating
card at the Orpheum this week and the
Johnnies are twisting their lips in six
eighths time trying to whistle her chic
French songs. Her mimicry Is without
apparent effort: it flows naturally .like
water down hill, and It compels laughter
and admiration. While her French has
the true Paris Exposition flavor, her Irish
brogue is redolent as the turf of Conne
mara when it bu*ns on the hearth under
the pot of mealies. She is well supported
by Clayton White, who displays his ver
satility in' the dissimilar roles of the
Sporty husband and the professor of
Physical culture. Among the other new
comers the Quaker City quartet, .in their
musical sketch. "Fun in a Barber bhop.
are welcomed with encore after encore.
They happily do not belong to that de
testable tribe known ?s trick musicians,
but they are music and fun makers of the
genuine brand. The Cohans broke two
dozen corsets in the audience last night
and what greater tribute to their fun
making power could be given than that?
The Todd- Judge family, the three great
est acrobats before the American public
to-day. Introduces some new feats of skill
and strength. Gilbert and Goldie. Car
rinirton. Holland and Galpen and the
Musical Dale of the holdovers make a
combination that may always be depended
upon to draw big houses.
Alcazar.
The dramatized version of "Carmen"
was presented at the Alcazar Theater last
night to a crowded house. The play was
well staged and the costumes picturesque.
Miss Florence Robert3, In the title role,
was not at her best. Carmen Is supposed
to be a fascinating, heartless coquette,
but Miss Roberts' conception of the part
was If anything, a common, vulgar scold,
with nothing to attract men to her. Miss
Lorena Atwood made her first appearance
at this theater and was warmly greeted.
She played the part of Mercedes and left
nothing to be desired. 'White Whlttlesey
was Don Jose and acquitted himself cred
itably. Jeffrey Williams was not a suc
cess as Escamlllo, but Howard Scott, as
Garcia, was excellent. George P. Web
ster, as Rover, a soldier, was too bois
terous.
Fischer's Concert House.
Erma Wing, a San Francisco soprano,
made her debut at Fischer's Concert
house last night and was accorded a warm
welcome. She sang the Page's song from
the "Huguenots" and In response to an
encore gave the "Last Rose of Summer."
"With Isabella Underwood as Romeo and
Slg. Abramoff, she also sang the mar
riage scene from "Romeo and Juliet." and
displayed- much dramatic ability. Mas
ter Norman Phillips lent novelty to tt>e
programme by giving some Shakes
pearean recitations, and the d'Estelle
Sisters gave two pretty dances. Miss Ui.
derwood and Slgnor Abramoff sang solos
and Hlnrlchs* orchestra gave a varied
programme. To-night little Melville Coafc
ley a child singer and Impersonator, will
be added to the bill.

Burton Holmes' Lectures.
Burton Holmes will deliver a series of
lectures at the Columbia Theater on
Thursday afternoons and Sunday nights
during the Miller season. Henry Miller
stands sponsor for the lecturer and his
lectures. In the East the Holmes lectures
have become an acknowledged factor In
the amusement and educational world,
and are an annual event at Daly's Thea
ter, New York, during the Lenten season.
The lectures are Immensely Interesting,
amusing and instructive, while the illus
trative features, which consist of a pro
fusion of magnificently colored lantern
slides and a large series of motion pic
tures taken In the countries lectured upon,
far excel anything heretofore attempted.
The lectures will be given exactly as given
at Daly's Theater, New York, in every
minutest detail, the subjects being
"Manila," "Japan Revisited," "Round
About Paris," "The Grand Canyon of Ari
zona," "Moki Land" and "The Hawaiian
Islands." The first lecturT; will take place
on the afternoon of Thursday, July 19,

Private Detective
P.J. Curtin's Pe
culiar Position.
Henry Le Blanche's
Victim Tells a
Strange Story of
Attempt on Her
Life.
Just what happened after that it is diffi
cult to say. Mrs. Le Blanche says that
fhe was able to return to Hansen's room
and put on her skirt and jacket, which
t-he had nrglocted to secure in her rapid
fMpht. ThÂ«? others say she had her skirt
and jacket on when she lir=t appeared in
the hallway. Her own story is borne out
by the fact that when Hansen returned
"Pl^asf save me: My husband will kill
tne:" The stranger tightened his grip on
her arm and replied:
"All right. I'll protect you," and then.
In the wxt breath shouted, "Here she is,
Le Blanche, get it ready."
Divining the plot, Mrs. Le Blanche
Â¦wrenched herself from her captor and
Ftruck him violently in the face. He let
go of her suddenly and she fell forward
on her knees. Just then Lc Blanche
closed In from behind and, with an oath,
lired a bullet from a 33-caliber revolver
Into hi? wife's back.
This note was taken from the boy by
Le Blanche and his party. Thtir excited
ciscussion of the contents was heard by
Mrs. Le Blanche. Â»Tio was in bed. Whe'n
they knocked on her door she quietly
slipped, out cf a window to a back ve
randa and along to a door in a small hall
way that lt-d back to the main hall ami
the* stairs. In two more bounds she would
have been free and could have made her
escape.
But a heavy hand was laid on her arm.
In her fright she could only see that it
â¢was not ht-r husband, and screamed:
cri ra RS. HEXRY LE BLANCHE, who
//\'/\ was shot through the body by
II A\\ her husband in the Webb House,
** at 37 Second street, yesterday
rnornlnp:. and now lingers between life
and death at the Receiving; Hospital, tells
a story of the affair which, if proof can
be obtained, will certainly implicate one
or more f=o-called private detectives,
whom she charges with being accomplices
of her husband. She asserts positively
that she was held firmly by the arm by
a mail whom she did not know while
L* Blanche shot her. This man, she says
poized her while she was trying to avoid
her husband, who had threatened many
time? to kill her. and shouted to L*
}4!anche to come to his assistance. The
husband responded by fixing his pistol into
her back at close range while she was on
h<.-r knees, and now seems to glory in the
exploit. , , ,
P J Cm-tin, a spotter in the employ of
John Curtin's detective asrency. had fol
lowed the woman to Captain Andrew
Hassen's room, in the Webb House, about
]u::fi o'clock Sunday niuht. and after
making euro that she would likely remain
there, went to Le Blanche'** restaurant.
at 119 Stockton street, and notified the
husband of his wife's whereabouts. The
latter secured the services of his second
rook. Leon Darnel, as a witness, as he
claims and the three returned to the
Webb House, just Sn Time to meet Captain
Ilansen descending the stairs.
Hansen recognized Le Hlanche in the
dim light of the hallway, and although he
h;id merely stepped out, ball clothed, to
secure ponie beÂ«-r. he decided that discre
Â«ion was the better part of valor and
walked rapidly to another house on Bush
street, where he rented a room. He rang
up a messenper boy and sent the follow
ing note to Mrs. LÂ«e Blanche:
Betrayed by a Note.
Drar Katie: I am at Hush street. 339. I will

Mrs. Dora Elliott, 11% Dlkeman place,
who was arrested by Policeman E. G.
Ring Sunday night while on her way
home and charged with soliciting, ap
peared before Judge Conlan yesterday.
One of her sons was in court with her.
Ring testiiied that he saw her speak to
a man, but did not hear what she said.
He went up to her and asked her what her
business was. She became excited and
hysterical, and said it was none of his
business. He asked her what she
was doing out so late talking to men on
the street. She denied that she had talked
to a man, and he placed her under arrest.
The Judge dismissed the case, and Mrs.
Elliott "said: "I was within half a block
of my home, Judge, and hurrying along
the street when this man arrested me. 1
met no one that I knew, and talked to no
one at all."
AV'hen the parties left the courtroom
Ring went up to Mrs. Elliott and apolo
gized to her for making the arrest, but
explained that under the circumstances
he was compelled to do what he did. The
lady declined to accept his apology. She
went to Captain Wlttman and maue a for
mal complaint against King, accusing him
of having been intoxicated. After hearing
her story Wittman preferred charges
against Ring before the Commissioners of
arresting a woman without lawful reason
and with no evidence to sustain the
charge; also of failing to report off duty
after the expiration of the watch.
Ring was sent for by Chief Sullivan, but
as the Chief had an important engage
ment Captain Seymour took the patrol
man's statement. It was simply a repeti
tion of his testimony in court. He de
nied that he was under the influence or
liquor, but could give no satisfactory rea
son for not reporting off duty.'
Thomas Nelson, the ten-year-old boy
who was dragged out of bed by Policemen
Robinson and Schmidt and put Into the
"tanks" because he was suspected of
stealing some brass hinges from William
Helblng. a contractor, had his case dis
missed by Judge Conlan yesterday. r*o
complaint was hied charging the boy with
burglary, and the Judge remarked that
he should never have been arrested.
Charges against the two officers were
immediately filed with Secretary Cad
walader of the Police Commissioners.
They are accused of violating sections of
the Penal Code by refusing. to tell the
bov on what charge he was arrested and
for not immediately taking him before
a magistrate.
The case has aroused considerable in
terest in the Mission, where the child's
parents are well known and respected,
and every effort will be made to punish
the officers for their harsh treatment and
degradation of a boy against whom noth
ing wrong had been charged previously.

to the room at 5 a.m. he found blood on
the bed.
Police Are Indifferent.
Patrolman Meyers heard the shot and
r< ached the hall in time to catch Mrs. Le
Blanche in his arms as she staggered
about the place. Curtin remained by the
Fide of the woman until the police ambu
lance arrived. Le Blanche did not seem
at all disturbed over his -wife's condition
and readily delivered up his weapon to
Patrolman Sullivan, who was close behind
Meyers.
Curtin and the cook, Barnett, â¢were
taken to the City Prison with Le Blanche,
and Captain Hanson was rounded up
later. Now all members of the party are
at large. Despite the fact that Mrs. Le
Blanche's wound is likely to prove fatal
and the assault made upon her was most
cowardly. Police Judge Fritz signed the
release of Le Blanche on the merely nom
inal bond of 12000. Captain of Detectives
Seymour seemed to take no interest In
the case whatever. He took the state
ments of Curtin, Barnett and Hansen,
and then released them and apparently
dismissed the whole matter from his
thoughts. He appeared to resent any
questions on the subject. Sergeant Con
boy of the Southern station, however,
took a lively interest in the case. He
took Curtin to the bedside of the woundea
woman in the hospital. Curtin left his
long, brown overcoat behind in the Jail.
He removed his hat and sat down. Mr>.
Le Blanche was in terrible pain. She
glanced at Curtin and said:
"He's not the man."
When Curtin stood up and put dn his
hat she said he "looked like the man."
Sergx-ant Conboy made the following
brief report to Captain Spillane:
JULY 2, 1900.
Captain Spillaneâ Sir: Private Detective P.
J. Curtin presented this card et the City Prison
to Lieutenant Mooney when all hope of escape
was tone and admitted that he had made a
mistake to go v.ith the husband to the room
where the shootine tock place.
Section 971, Penal Code, says "accessories are
crinclpals." '. CONBOY.
