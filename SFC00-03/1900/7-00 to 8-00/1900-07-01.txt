was evidently the subject. There was also
present a man with a kindly, Teutonic
face, a fair beard, bald head, and gold
rimmed spectacles. Tinka presented him
to Lea:
"This Is Professor Justus Hoedel, my
husband."
In the middle of the room the round
table, covered with a cloth, displayed the

girl went toward the closed windows. ThÂ«
delicate, ashen light of the evening was
creeping over the landscape and a faint
mist clouded everything.

her disillusioned melancholy.

said, "when night fall?. There is no moon

and even of the young servant smiled at

them indefinitely, and their hearts throb

The professor 1 * deep voice broke the sil

Lea behind tho glasses of his gold-rimmed
spectacles, had been watching her for a
few moments, and for his simple' mind the
result of his observation was that Lea ap
peared to have a keen appetite.

They all sat down. The warmth of the
room and the eatables unloosed the lit
tle girls' tongues. While the others, ac
customed v to a. cold supper, were eating
caviar and smoked meats. Lea took a
plate of warm consomme with a poached
egg In it. Ida confided to her elder sister
Caroia a secret desire to taste It, and se
rious little Caroia could not keep, the se-.
cret, but told it to all those around, the

"Oh! carve them for me. papa, I. pray

their mother. y

afraid of the. truth? The truth never did

"Thev packed our trunks quick, and we
took the liont in the evening- to go tn

the rats will not eat it."
"Aline Is upstairs." said Caroia. "I did
not forpet it. But I don't want to wear it,

Ida."
"Oil." resumed Georg. "how Ftrong 1
was at that moment. The despair of hav
ing failed to win Leu from her compan

tified my conviction. I hated the past.
The. roore 1 suffered the Etirer 1 felt cf
the truth."
Lea could not help asking:
"And now, Oeorg?"
"Now, months have elapyÂ»d and nat
urally tar from the country of light 1
have become again a little of the barbar
ian of former times. The truth no longer
appears as imperious and vioj^jit as of
old.- If it ' had not already been accom
plished I doubt whether I should have
will pov.-cr to reunite Tinka and Hoedel as
I did then. Like Tinka. I look back wL* w
â¢ sympathy upon the phantom of our fur
mer consciences which inspired us to the
flight regarded by people In general as
an act of madness."
Professor Hoedel let -his fork, with
which he- was struggling with the carcass
cf a grouse, fall into hiÂ» plate and cried:
"You are surely not going to begin again
and leave mÂ»? alone a second time with
the children?" . _
He said it with an -flfhdtSEruised terror
that set.' everybody around the tab'e
shrieking with laughter, the children
louder than the others with that Instinct
ive laughteivof childhood In which domi
nates their desire for .movement anil
noise. Â¦ Â¦
"No. Â¦ Justus," sakl Tinka, looking nt
Hoedel with affectionate kindliness. "I
will never leave you again. Did I not tell
you n few momenta ago thaj; my present
conscience is in perfect accordance with
my life?"
"That may he," said the professor, rath
er ruefully, "but suppose you find your
other conscience, as you call, it, at
Larmsoe when we return.'and; It- acquires
control of you again? God onlj - knows
what will happen then. I would prefer
never to' see: Finland again!"
This time it was Georg who replied: .
"Don't he afraid, Justus. Precisely be
cause our faith is less overbearing, wfl
are Incapable of taking such a violent and
unexpected decision as our flight, or even
as our return. ,The troth now appears.
' to me as a changeable communication be
tween the worlo and my mind." .
Hoedel. a little reassured, poured out a
glass of beer and. to prove his desire to
be agreeable.- said:
â¢?You mean probably that there exists
an objective, and a; subjective truth. We
learn that at the university."
Georg did not reply, but Edith, who up
to that point had said nothing, protested:
"You talk like Gentiles." she cried se
verely. "The truth is unchangeable, -For
he never changes/ he who sakl. 'I: am the
way , the truth and the life.* Apart from

of the- Devonshire fruit, which Is equal
to the most magnllicent gathered in
southern countries. Lea ate of all with
keen appetite, no longer as a sort of duty,
as when she was in the Commercial road
hospital. In obedience to "Little. Tom's"
prescriptions. A . little champagne was
poured out into the Rlassea. and the chll
'Iren having tasted it. their noisy chatter
peon put a stop to any continuous con
versation.
"I'ncle Georg," cried Ida. clambering on.
the knee of the young man. "are you go

French lady Is here?"
"^hall you take her nut to sea with
you?" asked Caroia. more timidly, watch
ing her .-Â«istor'3 antics without daring to
Imitate them.
. Tinka was just then telling Lea of the
strange life led by Gtorg since his re
turn irom Paris.
"When he came back to London from
Larrosoe. bringing the children wit!) him,"
ahe said, "his nervous prostration alarm
ed me. lie seem* tl to have exhausted all
his energy in thla act of atonement. He
became much fÂ«cbled In London, remained
shut up all day long in Apple Tree Yard,
refused to go cut or to see any one, ex
cept us and clear Kdith. As far a.s re
gards her, he never tired of hearing her
talk of the days you had passed together
in Clurlfs &. Sons factory. What trouble
we had to make him agree to leave Lon
don! At Hrsst we went to Pcr.zanre, In
Cornwall. And there lie suddenly appear
ed to be hypnotized by the ora and made
several voyages with the fishermen. He
would disappear for weeks at a time. I
was very uneasy about him. But the sea
hf" isaved him. has restored his strength
".rfrid his desire for life almoHt in spite of
himself. During one of his cruises he dis
covered Torquay and %vas immediately
fascinated by Its resemblance to Italy. So
he dragged ua here."
"What does he do here?" asked Lea.
Georff. continued to play wtth the two
gjrls, but his eyes at each moment sought
and caressed Lea's affectionate gaze.
"lie continues to lead a solitary exist
ence away from us." continued Tinka.
"But he seems to ha\"e become tired of
long voyages. It is very rare th<U he
goes, outside this favored bay. There is a
rock t-allod Gilder Rock not far from Tor
quay, near St. Mary'* Church, about two
miles from the coast. It belongs to a
certain Mr. Saville. whose father seems
to have been an origina! sort of Individ
ual, for he built a little church, which
his death prevented htm.frqm completing
upon a little plateau half way up the
rock. The present Saville or. rather, his
steward, agreed to let the rock and the
church, already in ruins, to Georg and
he has had It furnished after a fashion
and has made a sort of studio of the
church. He spends his days there far
from everything. He has even slept there
on one orÂ«two very 'warm -nights in Au
gust. As for me, I have never se*n
- iillder Rock, except from afar: in' faJt.
from the to war of St. Mary's Church.
Georg has never consented to take m* or
the children >wlth him. although they im
plore him to do so every day."
Â»" "He will take me.", thought -Lea.-V

be alone with him, face to face vlth tbe

'> "Ah .'Doctor!" cried ' . Georp." going to
meet him. He presented him to Lea: *'My

her. "Lizzie wished to take the children

BEYOND this point were gardens in

that these points, were Princess Pier anJ

Iho past, all the future, are contained in
the swing of a pendulum. Paris. France,
the schoolâ PirnitJV, Frederique, Duyvecke
âall this surged up before her. She could
distinguish the absent objects and beings
as in the night an entire landscape comes
to view prodigiously distinct In a sudden
Hash of lightning, and then it suddenly
enaced. She saw her two existences, her
two countries, simultaneously, that of to
day and that of yesterday. Something
seemed to snap invher heartâ a link that
she had believed broken a long time ago â
aifd the rupture was painful. The exiled
girl by a formal act of her will had re
nounced country, family and all the past.
; "This Is my family and country," she
thought.
She loved all the objects that welcomed
ber. that rejoiced In her presence. Tinka
and Georg, whose eyes never left LÂ»a's
visage, realized that she gave herself to
all vain coquetry, for herself or others,
the nurse's rigorous principles weakened
in favor of Lea. so thankful was she that
she had nursed her back to health by her
care and iufluepce. Besides, she longed
passionately for Lea to be found attrac
tive by Georg, and for the marriage to be
accomplished. She dressed the girl llko
a mother dresses a daughter whom she is
going to present to her betrothed. Lea
put on one of the dresses that she had
made in her lodging In Gower street with
the.help of the Cockington girls, a light
costume of red velvet, dotted with orange,
which dissimulated the thinness of hor
body and added a little color to her pal
lid face. .When she entered the drawing
room, followed by Edith, smiling with
happiness, she read admiration upon all
their faces.
"Oh, Lea. dearest: how beautiful you
are, and how well you look!"
It was Tinka. dancing with joy. who
spoke, frivolous again, now that she was
reassured; by the sight of Lea standing
before her living and beautiful. .
Georg was there also, and came and
?ook one hand of his beloved and kissed
They kept up my courage to live at a
time when I was really wretched, all
alone with them at .home in Larmsoe.
That was when your mother was travel
ing with Uncle Georg," he added, turning
to the two girls, who were not even lis
tening to him. "Yes, thanks to laughter
and playing in our empty houses-much
more than to my workâ I am an entomolo
gist and love my scienceâ the methods of
solitude merely resulted In giving me gray
hairs."
The active young girl with the pink
apron came in again, cleared the table
and put a brace of grouse cooked In bacon
upon the table.
"Lizzie." said Ida. in her clear voice,
stopping her as she passed. "I have taken
a little of the French lady's soup. I think
there was too much salt in it. I don't
like salt."
"For shame, Ida!" said Lizzie, In a low
tone.
She disappeared, quick and silent, bear
in? away the plates.
"Is that your servant?" asked Lea.
"No," replied Georg. "She Is the daugh
ter of Captain Morley, the little red-faced
man who carried In your luggage. In his
youth the captain traded for years, prin
cipally between England, and India, China
and Japan, and picked up most of the ob
jects that decorate this house' during his
voyages. He lives here with his wife and
daughter and lets the house during the
season." â¢
"And Madame Morley?"
"Oh! we never see her. She Is asthmatic
and can only go upstairs with difficulty.
She usually stops in her room, on the
second floor."
Tinka had raid no attention to Lizzie
Morley or to the remarks provoked by her
his Hbrarv, smoking his pipe with his old
friends. I am sure that another Tinka is
there, waiting and watching for me in
that wooden building, near the big porce
lain stove. And that other Tinka make3
me afraid."
Looking at her brother, she continued:
"That other Tinka. Georg,- has retained
all our old ideas. We should recognize
our old conscience in her. She may per
haps be hostile to the Tinka of to-day
who no longer thinks exactly as she doe3.
The Tinka of to-day is right; but was the
ether one wrong?- Was sha mistaken?
I am afraid of discovering that there are
several progressive truths, different and
yet each true in turn. Oh, Georg. when
you returned to Larm3oe to bring my hus
band and my daughter back to me, when
you recognized afar off oup house, nest
ling in the snow, and the somber trees
In the garden., which seemed to mount
guard over it, were you not also afraid of
finding your old conscience standing- upon
the thresholdâ the one that had com
manded you to do the exact contrary of
that which you were going to do?"
Georg, like Tinka, had ceased eating.
Leaning back in his chair, with downcast
eyes and with the meditative beauty of a
young sage, he replied: : . .
. "No. I returned there impelled by a
strength that knew neither hesitation nor
obstacle. If I had found the phantom of
which you speak I should have driven it
brutally from the threshold. The new in
flux of light and life had penetrated and
transformed the barbarian that I used to
be. I believed I held the absolute truth.
My conviction and confidence were bound
less. Hoedel was subjugated by it imme
diately."
"Yes," murmured the scientist; "Georg
cal quotations were an endless source of
amusement for them. .
"Happy Kdith:" murmured Tinka in a
low tone. "A few sentences are sufficient
to solidify her faith. Just as Caroia ana
Ida are satisfied with little stones which
they pretend are pieces of gold. *Â£""*
and Ida Imagine they can buy the whoie
world with their stones." .
Edith blushed, Lea had listened viith
gladness to this conversation, in whicn
she had only taken part by asking a ques
tion. She was not accustomed, as uniw
and Georg were, to abstract discussion,
nor had she. any particular taste for it.
But the simple, tranquil conversation or
the brother and sister charmed .her ears
like a once beloved but l:mg silent music
which imperiously awakened old mem
ories and took her back into the cherished
time of her sentimental initiation. And
even the sense of Georg and Tinka a
words added to her happiness. It would
have saddened her to hear them renounce
the past and the moral faith that hacl
made them so attractive, so exceptional
In Lea's eyes when she first knew them
in London. The Georg that she had seen
in Paris, destroying his idols, had not ap
pealed so closely to her heart. To-day,
in meeting a Georg and Tlnjca resembling
the Georg and Tinkn of old in face, she
rejoiced to discover that their minds were
unchanged. She felt a sentiment of ten
derness for the beings and objects around
her. As she was sitting between Tinka
and Georg she bent over Tinka kissed
her at the nape of the neck: and Georg
was thrilled by the kiss. ;
In the meantime the Indefatigable lit

Bteam crane was hoisting the cargo into

Tall electric globes, like a necklace of
tnauve pearls, outlined the curve of the

Beyond the most distant of these lamps
the obscurity began again ami all the

But Just in front of the Morley s dwell

Bt the masts of ships and yachts, like a

tea In a Ions red and green root, with a.

And that sea, faintly revealed by a few
phosphorescent gleams; that sky, with Ira
reddish stars; those scattered lights; the
balmy air of that fortunately situated
bay, the vast silence in which every sound Â¦
could be countedâ all united to form a
landscape of mystery and enchantment.
Lea, standing leaning on the iron balus
trade, between Georg and Tinka. felt th;it
this scenery equaled her vision. In the
feverish nights spent in the hospital she
had already looked upon this night. Its
southern warmth, impregnated with Fait
and iodine, had already soothed her limbs
and cicatrized her throat ami lun?s. She
nestled closer to Tinka's supple figure.
"Oh, Tinka!" sho .murmured. "I am so
happy here. Keep me near you. I want
to live. I want to be happy."
"Yea." replied the young woman. "It is
very beautiful. "We- ought to love this mo

Some moments passed and no one spoke. *
A little space still separatf d Georg ami

were thinking of the same thing, of the
same hour in the past, when they hmi
also leaned side by side on the balustrade
of a terrace overlooking the Thames and
had looked into the night top-ether. Then. '
as now. they had felt a violent desire to
embrace one another, to become one, the
desire that torments and enfevern the
blood of young creatures who love each
other. But a law of their conscience, al
though they had not formulated it clear
ly, had restrained them then. They would
not yield to their desire; they hardly ad
mitted this desire. To-day their eon
sciences were free. Through a. hundred
trials they had succeeded in rejoining
each other. They were near one another
â were free to belong to one another.
"I am going upstairs to see the little
ones." said Tinka suddenly.
She slipped away quietly through one of
the open windows leading Into the yellow
drawing room. Lea and Georg. turning
around to look after the neat, white sil
houette then perceived that Edith was no
longer there, although they had believed
her to be sitting In the dark at the other
end of the bak-nny.
They were alone.
Lea. realizing: this, was seized with a fit
of indecision. She turned toward tho
house, then made up her mind and moved
away as though to go after Tinka. Georjj
retained her by the arm and murmured:
"Stop here. I implore you."
She obeyed at once, overjoyed by words
which guided her wavering will. She
threw Edith's cap? on a chair in tho
drawing room and followed Georg to tho
" corner of the balcony, where he led her
and where he was leaning against the
iron bar. Their hands trembled when they
met. seeking each other. They looked In
each other's face by the light in the room,
which lit up the hak-ony. Then Genre"*
hands abandoned Lea's, which fell limply
by her side. He caressed her arms, her
shoulders, quivering at the thrilling con
tact of her velvet dress. He Joined his
hands behind the young girl's neck among
the soft curls that had slipped from thÂ«'ir
confines. Lea, vanquished, vie.Med up her
head to this loving clasp. She immolated
herself to the beloved victor, whom she
had found at last, unheedful of the inde
structible modesty which protested,
against that immolation. With her head
bent backward she only saw the immense
orb of the sky. in, which the red stars
seemed dying A delirious giddiness made
all things seem to turn beneath her feet.
She felt no other support in the vast,
dark blue ether than that provided by
the two beloved hands elapsed under her
hair, holding her suspended among tho
worlds. Her vertigo became so Intense
that she had to close her eyes, and then
she seemed to see her soul from within.
She felt the Impression that something
was drowning, was falling Into an abyss.
She saw Hhe Indtftnant face* of Pirnltz

the Image of the mystic Lea who had ex

"Oh. I want all that to disappear! T

She wished to be an ordinary woman, to

the slow delicate attraction of the fingers

There Is nothing that offends the eye

during recent years more than one sci

guardedly, ;;the opinion that the secret

poses of initiation.
A key to this entire mystery has now
been, found In that wonderful work, "The
Book of the Dead," -which Richard Lep
sius, a distinguished German Egyptolo
gist, discovered some years ago In the
tomb; of a priest named Auf Aukh," the
original papyrus of which is now pre
served in Turin. Scholars who examined
It soon after it was discovered said that
it was an exposition, more or less fan

there is too much going on that she needs

Nor does she simper.
N'or do her hands take on coquettish
quires and fancy flourishes. She is
straightforward and frank and earnest
and she will have none of these.
Hands on hips is bad, too. That again 1
looks much too restful. Let her hold tha

out to the dead the right road through,

their ' memory the "right word." whicH
alone could serve them'as a weapon.
'.'A recent and a more thorough examina
tion of this book, however, shows that
it Is far more than "a strange collection
of figlous and magical tests," or than a
mere exposition of the views of Egyptians
In regard to a future life, and that Lep
1 sius erred somewhat In entitling It "Tha

THK up-to-date girl is a thoroughly
tailor-made creature. A;.little while
back it was only the woman with
money who could afford tailor
gowns, but it is not *Â¦â¢> now. There, arc
so many tailor shops down 'side street.-?
(that started witii prtssing and repairing
but are now turning out suits as good in
appearance as the first-class : tailor; al
though they may not be so well made, it
is possible for a woman in very moderate
circumstances to have tailor gowns and
'ook just as well as her more fortunate
sister who paid a much larger amount,
but certainly could not have derived any
more pleasure from the dress. The dress
maker whose strongest point is dainty be
ru filed and lace-trimmed frocks will have
to exert herself to the utmost to convince
her fair customers that the mannish tai
lor gowns are not so well adapted to dis
playing their charms as the fluffy summer
frocks are.' To do this she will have to
show some very dainty dresses indeed.
Crisp little Miss Carrie-; de . Mar :has
brought from Paris to our coast inore
than a trunkful of street; costumes; and
every* one of them is as sternly simple as
Paris ordains. Kxcept the evening cape.
Â¦When. my lady appears- under electric
lights she may let go. of daytime re
straints, and then she rriakes up for her
tailor's sternness by enrJugh chiffon and
lace to float her up among- the clouds. -5
For a Fourth of Julv outins- a bewitch-
in? and patriotic little suit is made of
blue broadcloth. The waist is trimmed
with white braid. The sleeves have rows
of tucks at regular intervals. A darker
: shade yf blue surah makes the collar, also
vhc scarf around the waist, which is hn
Â¦ished off with white fringe. The hat is
lace, straw trimmed, with -.white lace in
iront and' piiiK .roses; and black velvet
bows in buck. , ...- Â¦ :; :>Â¦.-â¢-- -
For that -especial- day it wont take five
minutes to put red poppies in the place of
the roses, and there you are, as imperti
nently'. gay - as any American llag. that
ever waved.
A swagger street dress is the brown
cloth suU.with the Eton jacket. Narrow
bands of satin finish off the seams of the
skirt; The jacket has creamy lace around
the collar and a- broad strap of satin on
each side of the packet. The hat is yel
low straw, trimmed with black and green,
ribbon. The dress is set off by a white
shirtwaist. The cream lace of the suit
is worth talking about, by the way.
Thousands of women all over the world
are now using all their, spare moments
In making lace for themselves and their
friends: There are a great many beauti
ful designs for these new lace collars
arid scarfs. They are not only attractive,
but the work, is not at all difficult and
only a. moderate amount of experience
is required. /The colors used are cream,
white, ecru or blatk. . These can be worn
with nearly any kind of costume. A httlo
lace at the neck of a plain shirt waist
is just' the finishing touch needed to make'
a woman appear daintily dressed. Lace
on the street coat collar is a novel orna
mentation. It may be very simple or
elaborate, as desired. The lace . on a
brown broadcloth costume is in a heavy
open design, discernible at a distance, and
intended for the collar of tailormade suits
for street wear. A simple design may
ho used on duck or linen tailor suits.
I-ace scarfs and ties are also very stylish.
One very pretty scarf in English point
is in a leaf design. It is about nine inches
wide.- A variety of stitches may be used
in this or the design may be very simple.
A stock collar of satin is greatly- im
proved by a narrow fold of green, black,
or blue velvet forming an edge to thei
top. Lace ties are also very useful. They
add greatly to the beauty of one's cos
tume. Manv women have from six tof.
twelve and find them a delightful aid
to the securing of variety.
A Rood costume for morning wear is a
brown skirt with tan boxcoat, with a col
lar of darker brown velvet, ine sailor
liat is white. The automobile coat Is ex
tremely stylish for afternoon wear. It is
a soft shade of tan broadcloth with shirr
ed chiffon "covering, the collar and lapels.
The edges of this coat are bound with a
darker shade of stitched broadcloth Two
stripes of the same are stitched up the
back. The dress v.orn here v.-ith.the coat
is brown clotn ttntshed with narrow uiir.t.-Â»
of satin. One hat is toce straw, v.:Ui
â¢white and black velvet bow.

A Chinese view.
By Jhan fllun.
Ot'T of the awTcl opium war grew
the beginning of the Boxers. Be
fore th:it there had been peace in
China, iflsslonanes of all churches
had HvÂ«d within tbÂ«- Yinlls of the Imperial
City and had tnugh* reli^jlon and sclenco
with the free consent dad even assistance
of the rulers.
China i3 so vast a country, so biff be
yonil the comprehension of Americans.
The ctntral government is almost un
known to whole rrovlrues.
Here the. pernie spend their lives In
happy Innocence f>f the troubles that
sweep round over the rest of the world,
kindled, famed and burre about by the
telegraph, newspapers and steamers.
The society of Box.T? was Intended or
iginally to Induce the people to take up>
warlike drill, lha: they m:sht be able to
defend tneirÂ«clves.
Flower worship and the study of phllo
rophical pr.ems have bten all of the
cmuwm'nt!" of the Southern Chinese. In
the north, there hns always been raoro
Â«thle;!c spirit and devotion to ?port3, and.
it is ther* that the Itoxers have their
greatest power.

They have within their own country the

Â¦where all .-an bo compared stde by side.
It Is this opj/.ortur.ity f.or the proper study
cf mankind that givts the Americana
their broad understanding of foreign af
fairs and strange conditions.
It has been accounted an honor to be
long to the organization; in Its ranks
there are members of most of the best
families of China
the empire, and that the doing. must be
very presently. 'Their -remedy . is to re
turn' to the- methods r which have pre
served them already ,through*a geological
age or bo; to preserve, themselves just as
they would fruit, by shutting off'OUtside
communication and- keeping sweet." Old
ways are best,-' they say. Â¦ They arc the
conservatives of China. Â¦â¢ . ,
The radicals are represented by the Po
Wong Woey, or society for assisting, the
Emperor. They are. tho most progressive
and traveled -people of China, who fore
pee- that China -must fall in line with
the: procession, '.build railroads, public
works, steamers and have telegraphs and
free newspapers. . They, are -led byKang
Yu Wei. who is much favored by the Eng
li?h-speaking people â¢ In <Â¦ China. ,
Who is the head of tho great Boxer
There are few members of the great
Chinese patriotic order here in San Fran
cisco, the Boxers in China being 'largely
in the Manchu and Tartar regions of the
north, while the Chinese In California
are nearly all from Canton and vicinity.
Among them the reformers have a large
following. .
While neither of these societies is
revolutionary or rebellious, they by no
means agree with each other or with the
present Government.- . â¢'â¢ . â¢
That august adjunct to the sun. moon
and stars does not believe in doing any
thing. Jt is well satisfied .with itself, and
thinks the majesty of its presence suffi
cient defense against the assaults-of the
nations. '9tt3B3 RI 4wSStirottfiIEBNSP**i&ei
The Boxers, on the contrary, see that'
it is necessary to do something to save
Through it all they give careful at
tention to the expressions on their faces.
At ordinary times it is considered good
form to keep the face in immobile re
pofe, net Indulging in facial expressions
such as frowns and smileni That is very
vulcar from a Chinese point of view.
Boxer drill puts a different face upon
them. The command is then like the Ital
ian order, "Facclo . feroce" ("Look
fierce"). Â¦ : j-;^Â», : -
They do _tt, too â perfect image for the
devil to *ropy after, sometimes. All those
thing? help. The Chinese say. "You can
not win a woman with frowns nor a
battle with smiles." The first part we
all know is true. Ask some soldier about
the other, or perhaps he can tell you
about both; soldier boys think of ev
erything.
cst Prominent among them Is the
curved sword which seems to be common
to all Asia, varying from the single arched
scimitar of the Turk to the wiggly kris
of the Sulu Islander, which seems to have
been modeled after a crawling snake.

what ten million men are doing In China
to-day.
One hundred hundred thousand men â
that makes ten millionâ practicing tho
Boxer drill. Thoro may not bo so many.
Is the guess of some military men. Per
haps there will be another guess coming.
..- Those ten million Boxers believe In

Tamerlane. Alexander and Caesar were
conquering the world. They are sure that,
China can bo kept together for awhile.

at least 1500 lives were imperiled

from the actual shore line to the

away, and had caught four great

Those who gathered along the
shores of the Hudson River to
witness the great conflagration
saw a spectacle they can fiever
forget and one, that always will
have a conspicuous place in the
history of New York. â¢
River and bav were enveloped
in a pall of black smoke through
Â¦which angrj' flan;es, bursting as
from volcanoes, 0:3 the Jersev
shore and in the water itself,
leaped like red spheres into the
sky. The surface of ihe water
Â¦was covered with floating and
blazing masses of freight thrown
in haste from the doomed vessels,
and all united in the mad race to
rescue more precious human be
ings threatened or being sacri
ficed in the great ships. And
through the pall of smoke a great
crimson sun, enlarged to thrice
its size bv the haze, glared like an
enormous eye as it slowly, sank
in the west. Such was the tre
mendous spectacle presented on
the surface of the Hudson River,
as if it had been some holiday pa
geant. It was made tragic by the
realization that in that smoke
and beneath the turbid waters
scores of lives had been lost or
were then in their last desperate
struggle against death.
The spectacle was witnessed by
thousands and thousands from
both shores and by other thou
sands who crowded upon every

:â¢ ; Some Exciting Incidents. 'â¢ .. :.
The saving . of the I Kaiser Wilhelm . der
Grosse was attended- with exciting incl-:
dents. It seemed as. if it would never be'
possible to get her clear, and the:flre was
spreading .so .rapidly .that It threatened
at almost any moment to break out on thb
big ship. The great hawsers in the corifu-'
sion could not be handled well and axes
were brought into use to chop them, re
leasing the vessel. She was towed but Into
midstream and then far up the river. Her
bows were slightly burned. . Â¦ . ... ..; ;
'ITive minutes after the fire broke out a.
woman jumped from one of. the ships in a
vain effort to reach the water. The flames
drove her from the ship and she plunged
heedlessly In the direction It seemed
safety, lay. ' She leaped into a burning
lighter alongside the ship, and when an
oflicer on board the ship, who stood by
the doomed vessel, saw her : and realized
what would be her fate he plunged down
after her, hoping to drag her out of the
burning lighter into the water. He fol
lowed her within a couple. of seconds and
both ; went Â¦ down into the flames in the
lighter and perished. . *?t^
Flames Driven by the Wind.
. The rapid â¢ spread of the flames is ac
counted : for, by the shifting of the wind.
When the flre first broke out the wind was
blowing strongly . f rom . the south. " This
drove the flames across to the pier above
the one on which It started. 'Within a few
moments the wind shifted almost directly
to the opposite, point. ' A Under the great
pavilion on the land end the flames were
soon m absolute control. Had not the re- ,
Courpe to dynamite been taken to destroy
the Hamburg-American pier the Cames
might have gone on. All the flreboats and
tugs in the harbor would not have stopped
them. Â¦'"-â¢Â¦'Â¦Â¦;_Â¦:â¢..Â¦'Â¦.;. .â¢â¢'Â¦': . ; v .- ; .'â¢.. ;:'.'.. -.Â¦Â¦"Â¦.-Â¦ Â¦ .'Â¦

if they must abandon the fight. The van- j

flames were few and their efforts were

One Heroic Bescue. -
; dne -the j Hpsplial "with - burned
-bands" and" -.face" .was -rescued by. another
man.; more severely- burned -than himself:
.He. said he was helpless in the water when
the", other ' threw'< : an arm about him ~ and
bupyed him up. The other's face was fear
fully ;burned .-'and his arm was useless, but
he treaded water and floated so skillfully
that they drifted down the river and a tug
went to their rescue. The man who told
the story said he fainted after being res
cued, and did not know if his rescuer had
also been taken Gut of the water. ;
.- Some of those who went into the water
and were rescued and but slightly Injured
say that; when others were caught between
the fire and water and saw death coming
they, went insane. -.Men babbled of home
â¢and friends during the few brief moments
that they and the others faced death. The
fear; of the furnace which lay between
them ;.and the land bereft them of their
senses. There were acts of ; cowardice as
well as of heroism. Men clung to others
and refused to let go, even though the act
meant death to both. One of the survivors
was. seized by another man, who dung to
him frantically and refused to let go. The
man,- who was later saved, had to beat his
companion â¢; into insensibility â¢: before he
could loosen his hold: and plunge Into the

V The steamer Saale: drrt ted down to the

ablaze and -bet /crew .was on .deck.. Cap
tain . Smith; of the police boat put his Â¦ men
on '. a. ;tug Â¦ and -. ran to the 'burning ship.
When the tug reached the . Saale thirty
seven of the latter's crew were taken off.
Most Of them Were.CQns.Clous. Some suf
fered from smoke, inhaled. ; Ambulances,
were called, from Gouvernour, St. Vincent's
and Hudson-street hospitals. . Police pa
trol wagons i were 'also-. 'â¢'called.. The In
jured men were : taken: in these several
conveyances to the : different hospitals. All
appear- to be foreigners. : None could talk
English and not even their names were
learned at the pier. Â¦ V
While the crew was being taken off
Captain Smith saw several bodies of. men
on the ship's deck. . When the tug made
a second trip to the Saale all these corpses
were submerged.: . The ship had In the
meantime drifted to the Jersey shore and
sunk in Che mud off the flats.
The patrolmen worked with grappling
hooks Â¦ for two hours In an effort to re
cover the bodies. They secured . but two.
apparently deck, hands. They were burned
beytfnd recognition.
It Was a Terrible Sight.
Captain Smith said he thought there
were a number; of bodies below in the
Saale. ' J
"When I got to the Saale on the first
trip with the tug." he said, "I saw sev
eral men with their heads at the port
holes. The^- were stuck fast and could
get no further out. The ship was gradu
ally sinking. It was a terrible sight. Some
of the men called to us In their own
tongue to 'help them for God's sake/
Their struggles were something frantic.
We could do nothing for them. The up
per part of the vessel was a living fur
nace. We tried to get the prisoners out of
the portholes, but the holes were even
smaller 'than usual. I can even now hear
the poor fellows crying In their despair as
they saw us drawing away from them.
"We heard cries of others back of the
portholes. They seemed to be struggling
for what little air and respite the holes
gave those already there. It was terrible.
"We saw one woman at a porthole. The
flames were rapidly approaching her. She
was said to be a stewardess. A deckhand
on the tug handed her a small hose and
she played It about her stateroom for a
few- moments. They were serious mo
ments. My God. how that woman fought
for her life! She might as well have
poured a teacupful of water on to a liv
ing volcano for all the good It did. She
had no possible chance. As she fonght
the fire- the ship sank steadily and her
struggles were stopped by an Inrush of
water as the jioruiols sank below the
surface."
The steamship was to have sailed for
Boston auriag: tnÂ« afternoon. Tfce of3

men were still alive. They made them

belief- that some other man would add
greater strength to the ticket he (Sulzer)
would willingly withdraw.*
Mr.. Bryan told Mr. Sulzer he would not'
presume to dictate or even advise as to
the Vice Presidential nominee; that the
convention was competent to make a fit
selection without a suggestion from him.
He told Mr. Sulzer to go ahead with his
canvass and that his only hope was that

The two questions uppermost during the
dayâ and practically the only onesâ were
the financial plank of the platform and thÂ©

the sentiment of the gentlemen in Lin

as Mr. Bryan himself four years ago,
Congressman Sulzer and ex-Congressman
J. Hamilton Lewis repeated the state
ments made last night that there must be
an emphatic, explicit declaration for free
coinage at 16 to 1. The gentlemen around
them echoed the sentiment, and while all
were careful not to assume to quote Mr.
Bryan, It Was easy to see that they
claimed him as one of the disciples of the
original faith.
Colonel Bryan from early mornlns un
til late at night was the central, pole
around which gravitated the Democratic

SILVER ENTHUSIASTS
FLOCK AROUND BRYAN
KANSAS CITY, Mo., June 30.â Charles
A. Towne. the nominee for Vice President
by ihe Populist Convention at Sioux Falls
and candidate for the same honor at the
hands of the Democratic Convention, ar
rived in the city to-day and at once opened
his headquarters in the Coates House. He
gave his first attention to the arrange
ments for the convention of the Silver Re*
publicans, whi;h Is to be held In the auJi
toriwm in this city on July 4.'and later re
ceived a number of politicians.
"I really think that I can bring greater
strength to the ticket than any other man
who has been mentioned up to the present
time." he said in an Interview, "and in the
circumstances I consider myself the logi
cal candidate. It must be remembered
that back of me Is the. full strength of
the Populist and Silver Republican par
tie?, and while it Is true that a consider
able part of this will ro Uemocratic any
how. I am able to carry Up full vote, anil
this I do not think at the present time any
other man can do. The Sliver tienubli
cans will ask that th*r<Â» be In the Demo
cratic platform a specillc declaration for
silver at 16 to 1. An out-and-out reaf
tlrmation of the. Chicago platform wilt
satisfy u-<, but we would prefer the real
thinv ami no beatlnjj about the bush." .
Who w;ih to present his namn to tho
Democratic convention for Vice President
Mr. Towne could not nay. The matter
was to be nettled, he said, at a conference
of tho Silver Republicans* to be held on
Monday, and all arrangements regarding
his candidacy will be settled at that time.
As to whether his name would go before
the convention provided his candidacy
were not Indorsed by the Democrats at
the conference v to be held between the
Democrats nnd Populists and Silver Re
publicans prior to the convention Mr.
Towne would not say. but he intimated
that his name would be placed in nom
ination no matter whether the Democratic
committee accepted him or not.
"If tho Demflcnatic party Bays that It
does not want me," said he. "I rather
think that my chances of securing a nom
ination from them are somewhat slim. I
might not even get the nomination, even
though the committee said that It did
want me. The voice of a committee is
not always the voice of the convention
and it will be ample time for me to settle
that matter when I know what I am
called to pasH upon. At the present time
I would say, however, that my name will
go before the convention."

DEMOCRATS DIVIDED ON
THE SILVER QUESTION
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 1, 1900.

Hopes of Bryan and Democracy Frozen to the Trust Which Will Not
Be Condemned at Kansas City.
KANSAS CITY, June 3?.â There is a
constant bang, bang of hammers,
rasping of sawp, shouting of or
ders and rushing of fVÂ»fct day and
night at the big hall where the
I>emocratic National Convention is to be i
held. As fast as one portion of the struc- 1
ture is finishe'd the decorators pounce upon j
it Â£.nd with bflts of bunting. I'a.-^s and !
pictures of Democratic leaders. *ct In the
national coat of arms, cover up the
â¢walls and pjiace? so that the delegates who
assemble on' the Fourth will se<Â» all the
colnrs and emblems of the national holi
day coupled with evidr-nce of a Democrat
ic celebration.
Seme f^ars are expressed by now ar
rivals regarding the possible failure to
have the hall ready in time, but the gen
uine Western push and energy, character
istic of Kansas City, encourage tjie be
lief that everything will r*> ready when
Chairman Jones calls ihe convention to
ordr-r at noon next Wednesday.
The decorations on the outside of the
State delegation headquarters are not yet
in place, save in a few instances, a:;d only
a building here and there is ornamented
with ft^gs. but on Monday there will be a
great change in their appearance The
decorations are being saved in ordr-r that
they may be fresh when the delegates
come.
About the hotels, however, there is al
ready briskness and moving throngs of
ramiljar convention fac^s. A number of
old-line Democrats who have been going
to conventions for year? and the youngtr
men who belong to the "new Democracy"
have arrived and taken up the work "in
nand. Several boomer? of the Vice Presi
dential candidates have come in and are
making considerable noise. Â¦
Divided on Silver Issue.
Delegates are dropping in from different
sections and ths meeting of the sub-com
rnitteo on convention arrangements at
tracted quite a knot, of men about the
national committee headquarters.
As on Friday, the most interesting topic,
and that which gives the Democrats here
the most concern, is promised contest
over the 16-to-l phir.k of the platform.
The utterances of men like National
Chairman Jones. William J. Stone and
ether Western and Southern leaders, to
gether with the action of Western ana
Southern Democratic State conventions
in their platforms, would seem to indicate
that a reattirmution of the Chicago plat
form is all thrit would be necessary. Such
action under ordinary circumstances
would be apt to be accepted as the prob
able action of the national convention,
but the reports from Lincoln indicate that
16 to 1 must be specifically declared if the
views of Mr. Bryan are to be followed
There are so many delegates who desire
to carry out the wishes of the coming
nominee that tfcÂ» clash between them and
those holding different views is likely to
be spirited and the result somewhat
doubtful.
Chairman Jones said that the declaia
tion on silver should not vary the breadth
of a hair from that marked in the Cbi-
CCgo platform, and he thinks a reaffirma
tlon is sufficient. The breadth of a hair,
however, . is Ktill too wide for some and
they favor splitting the hair, especially
if the Chicago platform Is to be the test.
The extreme silver men insist that a "re
afllrmation would be a concession." Gold
men and others who have returned to the
party s:iy yuch a concession Is sufficient.
So the hair that Senator Jones spoke
about seems to be wide enough to cause a
lively contest when the platform is con
sidered.
There are some other features of the
platform that may not be agreed upon at
onceâ expansion, the present Chinese sit
uation and the Coeur d'Alene riots. But
the' differences over these can be readily
adjusted, as they are either foreordained
now or susceptible of manipulation by the
platform expert?.
Candidates Arrive Early.
Three Vice Presidential possibilities
came in to-day â the chairman of the Sil
ver Republican committee, who was
named by the Populists for Vice Presi
dent, Charles A. Towne: Benjamin F.
Bhiveley. ex-member of Congress from In
diana, and William Sulzer, member of
Congress from New York. The latter ar
rived late in the evening, after spending
a day or two at Lincoln, where he had
been conferring with Mr. Bryan. Mr.
Towne modestly outlined the reasons
which prompted him to bo a candidate.
Mr. Shiveley said he was not a candidate,
while his friends declared that he would
be presented by Indiana. No one" is yet
ready to hazard a prediction that any one
of these men will be selected.
The arrival of these candidates created
talk and speculation, but neither they nor
any one else can now even guess how
many votes any one of them will receive.
There has been a renewal of the talk
about nominating Mr. Bryan on the
Fourth of July, and a night Fession\has
been suggested in order to accomplish
this. It is even paid that he may be nom
inated before the platform is adopted, but
many are doing what they can to dis
courage the proceeding, declaring that it
will be crowding sentiment too far to de
part from the regular and orderly proced
ure of the convention.
Thfre is still uncertainty a? to whether
Mr. Bryan will come to Kansas City after
the convention makes the nomination.
No one now here is authorized to speak
for him. It has been said that the con
vention can conclude all its business in
two days, and the third day be devoted to
giving a reception to Mr. Bryan and
listening to a speech from him. This
would be an attractive programme, es
pecialiv for Kansas City, as the appear
ance of Mr. Bryan would doubtless attract
as many people as the opening day.
Although the National Committee has
taken no action, there has -been a great
deal of correspondence and consultation
among leader? everywhere on the*subject
at presiding f^Ticers, and the understand
ing is that Mayor Roue of Milwaukee will
.1>e the temporary chairman and James T).

leader in the House of Representatives,

CLARK-DALY FEUD v.^ ,
AGAIN TO THE FORE
KANSAS CITY, June 20.-So far us the
National Democratic Committee is in
formed, the convention -will have four con
tests to decide.' Only one. of yiese- con
tests involves a State delegation.' Two of
the others refer to the representation of
Territories and the other to the District of
Columbia. ' The State contest is over the
representation from Montana and the two
Territories involved are Oklahoma arm In-"
dlan Territory. ' . ; . Â¦" .Â¦ '
The greatest interest centers in the Mon
tana contention, because of the Clark-
Daly feud, which found such bitter ex
pression during the last session of Con
gress in the fight over the scat of Horn
\V. A. Clark in the Senate.
The advance representatives of both fac
tions are already here, and they are quite
busy in presenting their respective claims'
to recognition. Senator Clark will head
the delegation bearing his name, -while
the Daly delegation is led by Hon. Martin
J. Maginnls, who received Governor
Smith's appointment for Senator, as Mr.
Clerk received the . appointment by the
Lieutenant Governor In the absence of the
Governor. Others of the Clark delegation
are:, former Governor Hauser, J. M. Holt
Frank Higgins and H. E. Frank. 'Mr Ma-
Kinnis' associates are: Robert B. Smith
W. M. Cockrlll. Paul Fuse, Dr. J. M. Fox
and ex-Congressman Walter S. Hartman.
In this contest both the Clark people and
the Daly people claim regularity. They
held separate State conventions and both
were held in Butte on the same day. Some

Secretary Hay gave his personal atten
tion to the situation, though far from re
covered from his attack of Illness yester
day. He is still hopeful that there will be
found a satisfactory and honorable out
come of the present difficulties. Appar
ently the Chinese Minister here. Mr. Wu,
holds to the same belief, and this with his
personal knowledge of the actual 'senti
ments of the Tsung-li-Yamen.
The decision amounts to a practical
declaration that as yet there is nothing
official that will warrant the assumption
that the Chinese Government itself di
rected the uprising and attack.
But In the absence of the facts the Gov
ernment to-day determined to proceed
upon the line already laid down, namely,
that the Ministers are in Peking In need
of help. The Navy and the War Depart
ments will continue the plans set afoot for
the dispatch to Peking of an expedition to

that v.hey declined to leave until the other
foreigners were safely removed, some

New Steel Bridge to Be Constructed
at Knights Landing.
Special Dispatch to The Call. .
WOODLAND, June 30.â On June 17. 1S33.
the railroad company entered into an
agreement with Yolo and Sutter counties
for the construction and maintenance of
a drawbridge at Knights Landing for Joint
use as a highway and a railroad bridge.
The company has served notice on the
two counties that the bridge is now in
such condition that it will be necessary
in a short time to demolish it. The com
pany will build a steel bridge solely for
railroad use and does not desire any fur
ther partnership in the bridge with the
two counties.
The construction and maintenance of a
separate bridge for roadway purposes will
necessitate an extraordinary drain on the
road funds of the two counties. The ac
tion of the railroad company is no doubt
due to the course pursued by Sacramento
and Yolo counties in regard to the Wash
ington bridge.

Mrs. Dondore Leaves Property \ to
"Ballington Booth or His Suc
cessor in Salvation Army."
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN DIEGO, June 30. â A chance for a
legal fight between the Salvation Army
and the Volunteers of America la found
in the will of Mrs. C. T. Dondore. which
was filed for probate to-day. By the will
property to the amount of close to .T30.000
is disposed of, and one of the bequests Is
to "Balllngton Booth or his successor in
the Salvation Army." The bequest is of
property in Findley. Ohio, for which the
lady refused J20,000 less than three years
ago. The property comprises about fif
teen acres of land within the city limits
of Findley. Ohio, and It will be considered
worth more with the passing? years. The
fact that Balllngton Booth u not now
with the Salvation Army, but is at the
head of the American Volunteers, is what
may lead to the complications between
the two organizations, for the bequest is
certainly worth striving: for.
Only a short time since Mrs. Dondore
deeded two business lots in Kindley to
the Presbyterian church of this city,
two more to the Presbyterian church of
Findley, and two others to the Methodist
church of that city. Her property comes
from her father and from her grand
father, the latter having moved to Find
ley when there were but twelve business
houses in the place.
Among other bequests are two of a pub
lic nature. She gives the income from a
certain store building in the Ohio town to
the poor of that place. The amount is
about $1100 per year, and It is to be dis
tributed by the City Council each winter
to the needy. The other bequest Is the
income from property which rents for
about $500 a year to the public library of
Findley.

Pains, aches and rheu-

Kidney trouble causes quick cr unsteady

It used to be considered that only urinai/

five days in covering 313 miles. I . pros
pected Norton Sound and Golovin Bay dis
tricts on my journey, but found nothing en
couraging. I arrived in Nome on March 9
without mishap. Upon arrival I found the
country staked for miles in every direction.
I received infermatim of a good location
seme miles from here. I went there and
located sis claims. Tome thirty other proe-
I^ctors arrived on the ecene immediately
after me. A miners' meeting was called
I have had some experiences since I saw
you last which I do not care to go through
again. It is now June and we have had
fome of the woret weather this last week
that we have fcad this year. One of its
most prominent characteristics has been a
heavy gale, acempanied by a blinding
snowstorm. The bark Alaska arrived sorre
Jays since from San Francisco and was
blown ashore during the gale. Bhe went
to pieces Immediately and her cargo Is dis
tributed along the beach. Three tugboats
and one Eloojt were also wrecked and tome
lives were lost. The eteamers Bear, Mary
D. Hume. Alexander, Robert Dollar and the
schooner Louisa D were compelled to put to
sea cwlr.g to the severity of the fitorm. The
steamer? Portland and Dora arrived this
evenirjj.
That all Is not gold that glitters and
that the reports which come from the
Cape Nome goldfields are at times highly
colored is evidenced by a letter written
by William L. Phillips under date of
Nome City, June 9, to Judge Frank H.
Dunne of this city.
He says in substance that the country
is, Btaked for miles in every direction;
that some claims pay $2 per day; that the
beach claims paid well for a time, but
nothing like .the returns sent out, and
that they are completely worked out now.
He affirms that they do not average Jl a
day to each man engaged in mining. En
gineers and mechanics are scarce, $500 a
month not being an unusual salary for
skilled labor. The majority of the claim
holders are awaiting the coming of the
tenderfeet, to whom they may sell their
claims for large sums. The writer be-
Jleves the suffering will be intense this
bummer, as typhoid fever and other dis
eases are expected to develop. The let
ter in full reads:

I have heard of people going to California
and telling of their rich claims and the
money they have made here. Some of them
ought to be hanged. I epeak of the coun
try as I have found it, and I have trav
eled over as much of.lt aa the average man
here.
To show you the salaries paid In this part
of the world: I was offered JoM a month
and "found" by the Xorth American Trans
portation and Trading Co. to act as chief
engineer. Engineers and machinists are
scarce. The chief engineer for Lane &
Mackay offered me $15 per day.
The reports which have been sent from
here are exaggerated beyond all belief. '
It is true that some good strikes
have been made here. The beach paid well
for a time, but nothing like what was ex
pected. It is now worked out. A little
beach digging is Rolng on but no one is
making over $3 per day. If the money taken
out was uveraged among the men ut work
it would not be over $1 to each man. Two
or three creeks are good but that is all.
Some men own fifty claims ln different
places, but not 5 per cent of them pay to
work. They are holding them to sell to
the tenderfeet now coming in by thou
sands. The companies are booming the
country ln order to sell their goods at ex
orbitant prices. The suffering here this
summer will be something awful. To make
matters worse, typhoid fever is expected
to break out in another month or so, owing
to the bad sanitary conditions. This is a
breeding eround for fever because of bad
water and manshy eround.
ar.'i a recorder yas elected. It was de
cided that all pbwer of attorney claims
be taxed ?250. that being the amount fixed
by other districts. I prospected for three
weeks on the claims, but the best that any
claim on the creek would pan out waa $2
per day. A man near me was satisfied to
work for this small return In order to earn
sufficient money to take htm out of the
country. I own a half Interest In a claim
on Basin Creek, nbout twenty mllen from
hore. which I have left for my partner to
prospect.
Believes the Powers Erred.
A leading diplomat here, who has had
an extensive experience in China, said
that he condemned the present anti-Chi
nese course pursued by the powers, claim
ing that the naval demonstration with
which the hostilities began was unjusti
fied, as was the marching of troops
toward Peking In time of actual peace.
He considers the subjection of the Chinese
Impossible, and says pacification also 13
impossible. Besides, he adds, to accom
plish anything like lasting military suc
cesses against the Chinese at least 200,000
men will be required; but even then
Europe could not administrate China or
even some of the provinces of China. He
strongly advocates a policy of mutual for
giveness and forgetfulness and the putting
of an effectual stop to missionary efforts
there. He concluded with saying:
"We may leave it to commerce and time
to carry our civilization to China."
A number of papers, including the Tage
blatt, express astonishment at the meager
and Ill-considered reports from Vice Ad
miral Bendeman, saying the other nations
have been better served in this respect.
Kegrets are expressed by the Liberal
newspapers that the Reichstag's summer
adjournment deprives the nation of the
chance of obtaining detailed information
regarding the extent to which Germany
means to participate ln the Chinese ad
venture, which will necessitate the expen
diture of large sums of money. Several
of the leading papers demand that the
Reichstag meet In extra session.
The jingo newspapers advocate Ger
many's acquiring a large army for trans
marine uses. One of these papers, the
Sohiesiche Zeitung, justifies this demand
by the argument that some time a mas
sacre of Germans may occur ln the United
States, "in which case Germany would
be forced to throw large bodies of troops
upon American soil," adding:
"Once the feeling obtains in trans
oceanic countries that Germany Is power
less to throw large bodies of troops be
yond the seas Germany's prestige in
trans-marine ports Is gone."
Germans Dissatisfied.
There is growing dissatisfaction through
out Germany with the attitude of the
Government regarding China, especially
because the Government publishes litttle
otlicial news, and even some of this Is er
roneous. At the Foreign Office evasive
answers were given to inquiries about the
number of troops and ships which may be
dispatched.
The correspondent of the Associated
Press understands that the Emperor and
Count von Bulow, the Minister of Foreign
Affairs, who has just returned from Kiel,
have reached an understanding about
the general lines of Germany's attitude
ln the present crisis, subject to unforeseen
circumstances compelling a deviation. It
is certain, however, that the Emperor
could have all the volunteers for China
he wanted for the army if larger forces
were needed there, for the popular senti
ment against China is quite strong.
"There has been no question hitherto in
Europe of handing the Chinese Ministers
their passports. No one knows where the
foreign Ministers to China are. If they
went to tihang Kwan It was a step taken
by the Chinese Government for their pro
tection and was not their dismissal. The
sending of troops hence to China is use
less, for everything will be over before
their arrival. It will require six weeks to
get them to Tientsin, and Li Hung Chang
will suppress the Boxers in three weeks. 11
The Chinese Minister, however, admits
having received no direct news from the
Chinese Government.
"The old theory of 'no war' is still up
held. The understandings between the
powers are still Intact. No exchange of
notes la going on. Japan some time ago
asked the powers for their programme,
which communication was answered. The
press has been exaggerating the share
which diplomacy hitherto has had in the
matter. There has not been any talk of
dismissing the Chinese Ministers in
Europe."
Lord Gough, the Charge d'Affalrea, said
he thought the powers were keeping up
the fiction of "no war" as long as possible
out of fear of the difficulties that might
arise between themselves in China if war
were once officially admitted. The corre
spondent of the Associated Press inter
viewed the Chinese Minister. Lui Hal
I-louan, who said:

Thanks partly to the Boxers and partly
to the Boers coal Is going up rapidly.
Japan. Russia and the United States are
all ordering large quantities from Eng
land's stock, which Is aiready depleted by
the Immense demands for the transport
service to the Cape. Coal promises to
reach a record price this winter unless, a3
some merchants think, importations can
be secured from America. Already 10O.00O
tons of American bunker coal have be?n
landed at Glasgow and sold cheaper than
the fuel could be got from Scotland.
The probability of a big rise in wheat,
owing to the shortage of the American
crop, is also worrying the British business
world, for. though supplies are still com
ing in plentifully from Argentina, the In
dian crop is quite insufficient to meet its
normal demands.
Vice Admiral Seymour's unsuccessful
trip inland has brought upon him much
censure. It is maintained that he should
not have left the fleet.
Great Britain seems to have pretty well
settled down to the belief that the Minis
ters at Peking will not come to much harm.
The average observer agrees with Lord
Salisbury's Idea that if they are safe at
present, as there seems every reason to
believe. It is not likely that they will be
harmed in the future.
As a result of the dramatic debate pub
lic opinion seems fairly evenly divided
between two verdicts. First, that the
War Office is guilty of criminal neglect:
second, they reserve all judgment till the
Parliamentary committee reports. Mr.
Burdette-Coutts has suddenly Decome one
of the most prominent men of the hour
and the Government haa still to face thp
agitation which has stirred the country
almost to a greater extent than did the
declaration of war Itself.
Mr. Balfour for once lost his self-con
trol. Flushed and trembling with pas
sion, he denounced the attacks, which he
declared merely amounted to ungenerous
criticisms of Lord Roberts. This, the
Times denied, and in point of fact the
whole of Mr. Burdette-Ooutts' speech was
an attack upon the methods of Lord
Kitchener instead of Lord Roberts,
though this was not openly stated.
The Government was awake to the se
riousness of the crisis, and with surpass
ing oratory Mr. Wyndham took his
critics behind the scenes of the great
campaign, ln graphic language he dis
cussed the great difficulties of the com
munications and exposed for the first
time the daring conception of Lord Rob
erts' plans and the risks he ran. In
short, without tiring his hearers with too
many statistics, the Under Secretary for
War gave such a fascinating panorama,
interjecting facts to prove that the War
Office took all precautions, reiterating
that war must always be fearful, that
his hearers well nigh forgot the sick and
wounded in their admiration in the suc
cess of the great general; but this, the
Times points out to-day, all crumbled
away under the damning details present
ed by Mr. BurdetU-Coutts, who spoke
with the advantage of having seen
whereof he spoke.
He is nothins of an orator and was
obliged to present a mass of detail that
now and again grew tedious. He never
theless held his audience by the strength
and gravity of his statements. His dec
laration that "every statement that I
have made is true" was made with an
earnestness that atoned for all his rhe
torical cieiects. This terrible arraignment
of Great Britain's care of her wounded,
sick and dying 'made on Friday night Is
by far the most notable occasion of the
present session. The speech of the Par
liamentary Secretary of the Foreign Of
lice, George Wyndham, which was pre
ceded by Mr. iJurdette-Coutts and that <>t
the Government leader and Lord of th-s
Treasury. W. J. Balfour, that followed it.
were both efforts that neither man .haa
equaled, this year at any rate.
Mr. BurUette-Coutts has seldom spoken
in Parliament, and never before at such
length or with the whole nation waiting
to hear what he had to say.

PARIS, June 3O.-Mrs. Sarah Van Dycke
Hubbard of San Francisco died suddenly
at 9 o'clock" this morning at Elysee Pal
ace Hotel, where she has been staying
for some months rjast. She was apparent
ly well yesterday, but had an attack in
the course of the night. Mrs. Van Dycke
Hubbard had spent the last three years
In Europe and was at the point of leav
inp for Carlsbad to join her daughter
and son-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. Ryer, of San
Francisco. .
Mrs. Sarah Van Dycke Hubbard was
formerly a well-known resident of this
city and also of Marysvllle, where she
lived some years ago. Her husband was
prominent in business and political cir
cles and was at oiie time a member of the
staff of the Governor. When King Kala
knua announced his intention of visiting
this country the Governor delegated Ilub
bard to conduct the Hawaiian ruler to
WashintTton. Mrs. Ifubhard was attract
ed to a life on the stage and it is sal<J
that her determination to become an act
ress caused a separation from her hus
band. She failed, however, to make a
success and has since been living in re
tirement.

long time," said Captain Bicknell last
night, "and It is my. personal opinion
that the Ministers at Peking have them
selves to blame for the perilous position
in they now find themselves. Dnr-
In the past sixteen; months they have
been warned repeatedly what was com
ing . by Europeans and Americans who
have been in the Boxer country. No later
than last April I took the responsibility
of sending my marines to Peking to act
as a guard, but they were refused. '
"As a matter of fact no one can tell just
what has become of the diplomatic corps
at Peking, because of . the- strict censor
ship exercised by the old Empress. Her
agents see every dispatch sent out of Pe
king, and they may read it as they please.

CAPTAIN BICKNELL
BLAMES THE MINISTERS
"Just why the Monocacy did not re
turn the fire of the rioters when she was
fired upon I am not prepared to say, but
tho orders from Admiral Kempff must
have been strict. Our best policy is to
settle the trouble as quickly as possible
without permitting the European nations
to pursue their policy for the dismember
ment and partition of China. The parti
tion of China means the loss of the im
mense Chinese trade to us. Despite all
efforts to stop it that .trade has grown
enormously during the past few years.
We will lose It all If the dismemberment
of China, results from this trouble, while
"I believe that the whole trouble will
bo over in a month. It is merely a mob
movement and will die out of itself in
time, but much sooner if we have a suf
ficient force in the field to suppress it.
The Boxers will disappear .as suddenly as
they appeared and no one will be able to
say where they have gone.
they get, and mv experience has been
that a Chinese never tells the truth when
he can avoid it. It is my opinion that we
*herc in San Francisco can write as in
telligently of the fate of the Ministers
to-night as the most experienced corre
spondent In the Held. The censorship
maintained by the Empress is absolute,
and there is no way of getting around it.
The same thing may be said concerning
the reports published about the extent
of the Boxer movement and the number
of Boxers in the field, and in regard to
the attitude of the Empress and her
Government. We cannot know more
about it than the Empress is willing to
tell us.

I opened a rcine, built a cor.-*r.trating mill

very good, but no one I had WOOM ever learn

truth is. the Chinese are "chloriders." Work
on a small scale they understand, but thÂ«y are

Oscar H. Hershey writes to the Red

Ovtvide of our main fate vu a row of forges
at wr.,ch th* cheery blacksmiths worked openly
Â«.:! day Â¦,-:,'..: e articles for the market, and
every pound of the metal was stolen from my
war^houfc-s. The calls I took to that mine
would bu.l a village, and the supplies cf all
kinds etoiÂ»r. in the mort open manner were
immense in quantity. I had a Chinese of hiph
rank ar.d a magistrate who were charged
?-tpeciaily witr. the duty of preventing all this.

An amuslr.g account of personal experi
ences in raining in China has been writ
lea by John A. Church for the Engineer-
In* and Mining Journal. Mr. Church
writes that it does not seem credible that
schemes could be seriously presented to
Americans that involve the payment of a
royalty ii mounting to from Â£5 to SO per
cent ox the gross receipts. It is seldom
That a. mine can be lound that would
Etssd any such tax.
"The royalty, however," writes Mr.
Church, "is but the beginning of expen
sive demands. The pay and support ol of
licJaJs and military men and the money
composition for the thousand hindrances
that can be thrown In the way of a strug
ghr.p industry are matters that can be
calculated in advance, but there ib an
other source of expense which is not. sus
ceptible of calculation. That is the dis
htmesty of all handsâ officials and work
men."
Mr. Church discovered by personal ex
perience that the Chinese workmen in
China steals both for gain and because
<~<i a magpie disposition to take anything
I'tlonging to another, whether it is worth
ies or not to himself. He has been an-
Doyed for days by the loss of memoranda,
rr.ade on loose bits of paper, which, being
carefully guarded by the workman for
whose instruction they Â¦were made, were
t-tolen by a fellow-workman merely be
cause they were something treasured. The
laborers' kits were occasionally examined
by a iile of soldiers and astonishing dis
coveries were invariably the result. Bits
of paper, a handful of nails, odds and ends
of ail kinde were accumulated by men
who laid themselves liable to 3to blows
with a bamboo or even the loss of their
heads. One part of the mine that Mr.
Church directed in Mongolia was in shales
and occasionally a sheet of native silver,
.V> to l'JO ounces in weight, was discovered.
The mine owners never receiveJ more
than one of the sheets. They had a re
markable habit of discovering themselves
only at eight, when they would be re
moved bodily and divided in secret. The
facts came out when the fragments were
discovered in the workmen's kits. The
one ehect was saved because an Ameri
can miner was present when it came to
light. Here are Fome other statements
interesting to men who are calculating
upon reaping rich rewards from mining
enterprises in China when the present
turmoil subsides that Mr. Cburcb stands

The regulation governing the patenting
of mineral lands has recently/- been
charged. The Secretary of the Interior
sends out notice of that fact for the bene
fit of al! who may be concerned. The es
eential amendment is as follows: "The
riphte granted to locators under section
Â£222, Revised Statutes, are restricted to
such location on veins, lodes or ledges
as nsay be situated en the public domain.
In applications for patents on lode ciairrs.
where the survey cor.JlictB with the sur
vey or location lines of another lode
claim and the ground !n such conflict is
excluded, the applicant not only has no
right to the excluded ground, but he has
r,o right to that portion of any vein or
lode the top or apex of which lies within
such excluded ground, unless his location
was prior to May 10. 1S3Z His right to
the lode claimed terminates where the
lode, in Its onward course or Btrike, inter
sects the exterior boundary of such ex
cluded ground and passes within it." In
other words the statute is interpreted as
it reads, and previous rulings counter to
that view of the case are relegated to the
official waste-basket. Kor general infor
mation the statute Is given. It Is as fol
lows:
Tht lscatons cf all mining locations hereto

be hoped the politicians will be wise enough to give
the people a rest before beginning the parades and
the stump speeches. There is no need of a long cam
paign of education this year, as voters have learned
by experience which party means prosperity and
which means- disaster.
Editor Call: The death of Colonel
James Madison McNulty at Santa Bar-'
bara June 23, 1900, seems to deserve more
than passing notice, as he was for nearly
forty years a prominent man In our com
munity. He was born 'in Chemung Coun
ty, New York, September 17, 1S26. Stud
ied medicine and soon after graduation
â¢removed to San Francisco, where he prac

ordered to report to General Carleton in
Southern California and with the Cali
fornia column made the famous march
from Drum Barracks (San Pedro, Cal.)
across the deserts of California, Arizona
and New Mexico, one of the most won
derful marches in history, and his report
of this campaign made by order of Gen
eral Carleton and published in the "Re
bellion Records" Is a complete and ex
haustive record of the services of the vol
unteer soldiers of our State who were on
duty with this army. He was promoted
to be major and surgeon, United States
Volunteers, February 19, 1S63, and remain
ed on duty in the Department- of New

San Francisco, June SO, 1900.
\ Let us disregard, as does Mr. Spencer, the man
I who. as the poet and the ichthyologist, is born with
j so decided a bent in one direction that no curriculum
J can turn him in any other; he will develop in his
own way. But for all others certain subjects are
surely of primary importance, and to the acquisition
of at least the elements of these the student should b;
required to devote the first two years of his college
course. First in importance must come biology, or
the science of life, which includes, of course, hygiene
and physiology: this is no less necessary for eirls
Most boys who go to college are not "real stu
dents"; they know too little of life, too little of the
comparative values of different kinds of knowledge to
be able to answer Mr. Spencer's famous query, What
knowledge is of most worth? This is a question
which in its early stages should be answered for them
by those who have studied the science of education,
and the editor of the Cosmopolitan is quite right
when he declares that President Jordan's article docs
not answer this question at all. Yet it surely is an
swerable, unless we ire to confess that the world has
learned nothing about education between the time of
Plato and the time of. Jordan. V ;
The common meaning of "advanced studies" in a
modern American university is studies among, which
the student is allowed to choose after he has com
pleted his sophomore year â that is, after he has mas
tered those elementary subjects which are, properly
speaking, not university work at all. If. this is Presi
dent Jordan's meaning for "advanced," we fully
agree with him. for the young man of twenty who has
been two years in college and finds himself unable to
decide upon a specialty should at once retire
from the university If by "advanced" Presi
dent Jordan means all college studies, we cannot
think that he is wise in declaring that a prearranged
course of studies for the first two years is "an affront
to the mind of the real student."
WHfll SHflLU THE COLLEGE TE^CH?
I : N his of Herbert Spencers Essay
oh : Education" (July Cosmopolitan)' President
Jordan points out what progress- has been- made
since the publication, sqme^forty years ago, of; that
epoch-making little book and adds two gener^lizav
tions not without value. The first of these is that the
curriculum Spencer advocates is evidently planned for
the average cultivated man /and overlooks the needs
of the exceptional manâ the man, for instance, 'Hvho
is born to minister to the esthetic feelings of others
and to those alone.-' For such a man the road to cul
ture may be found to be almost entirely within the
confines of the old classical curriculum. The second
generalization is thai '"each course of study must bs
individual," and that "any prearranged course of ad
vanced study is an affront to the mind of the real
student." This statement must stand or fall according
to the interpretation you give to the word "ad
vanced." Nowhere in the course of his article does
President Jordan say just what he means by "ad
vanced study."
Thus with chivalry and with religion, no less thair
with patriotism and with valor, he dij his work in
life and served his country with heart and soul as
well as with hand and brain. Of such a man a nation
may be justly proud. C^irtyle has truly said: "God
fearing armies are ever the best of armies." So long
as such men as. Philip are ready to serve the republic
in arms there will be no danger that we shall suffer
defeat or that we shall disgrace our cause by inhuman
ity or by foolish exultation and vain pride in the hour
of victory. Philip merits the immortality that Eng
lish memory has conferjfcd upon Sidney for his chivai
ric thoughtfulness of others on the field of battle, and
among the utterances of great Americans which we
are proudest to recall should be those which at San
tiago gave to the world an illustration of the char
acter of this stainless ?nd noble soul.
A moment later, when all was over and the com
plete victory of the Americans with almost no loss
was made evident, Captain Philip assembled his men
upon the deck and said to them: "I wish to make
public acknowledgment here that I believe in God,
the Father Almighty. I wish you all, officers and
men, to lift your hats and from your hearts offer si
lent thanks to God.".
REAR ADMIRAL PHILIP.
BY the death of Rear Admiral Philip the republic
loses a hero who has added to the honor of the
American navy and given a new example of
noble life to excite : the emulation of aspiring youth.
Philip was one of thbse men who have carried into
\Var tlie sentiments of chivalry: and the devotion of re
ligion. His nature was singularly fine, and history has
tip record of a gentler or braver man in all her annals
Of War. :Â¦'-,' Â¦Â¦:.Â¦Â¦;: â¢: :Â¦Â¦â¢Â¦Â¦-. Â¦Â¦Â¦:Â¦Â¦ Â¦','Â¦"'Â¦
â¢Thei character of the man;; was illustrated by his
valor and; seamanship during the battle of Santiago,
and by his words and actions at the close. His ship,
the Texas, was; one of the foremost in the fight, and
he himself was distinguished by his cool courage at
every period of the conflict. Courage and coolness in
moments of danger and responsibility are, however,
not rare in war. The superiority of Philip over the
mass of fighting men was shown when the victory
came. As the Spanish ships lay broken and wrecked
on the shore, and their officers came up to surrender,
Philip turned to his exultant crew with the words:
"Don't cheer, boys; the poor fellows are dying."
That was one of the sublimest utterances ever heard
upon a battlefield, and attests the chivalric humanity
of the brave man who spoke it. â¢
In his periods of attitude and platitude Colonel
Bryan has been in th^hnbit of conveying his idea of
Republican decadence by inviting his audience to take
the dizzy fall from Lincoln to Mark Hanna. Without
stopping to defend Hanna, for he is very handy at
that himself, it may bs said that his fortune was made
in legitimate business, in adventure upon great en
terprises that employed labor and paid wages. Not a
nickel made in politics can be traced to him, and he
took to politics only after his supremacy in the busi
ness world had been acquired. Mr. Croker is a very
rich man. His millions surely outnumber Hanna's.
He has not for years followed, any legitimate busi
ress, and when he ceased to engage in any open and
honorable occupation he was poor. He had not even
by lucky irrvesmient of a little honestly earned money
laid a foundation of fortune. He quit business and
went intp politics. Every dollar of his vast fortune
has been' acquired in the expert manipulation of the
money of the taxpayers, or by the toll taken out of
vice and virtue impartially by the Tammany machine.
He is not known to have any legitimate investment
1 â¢ t- V 11.
in a business that employs labor and pays wages.
Having been diligent in the business of tithing drunk
enness. , shame and crime, he desired to stand before
kinss srtd not before mean men. So he bought an
estate and a racing: stable in England, where with
horses and hounds he lives like a lord, onlv visitini
this country when it becomes necessary to dictate the
action .of the Democratic party, which is the cat he
has' used' to pull out of the fire his abundant store
Now we wish to irivite the mention of Colonel
Bryan to the fall from JcfTerÂ«on to Dick Croker. It
is so profound and from such a height to such a
depth that the stoutcft paracRute will be in rags be
tween the ftart :,nd finish. Every dollar of Crokcr's
million* has on it the tears of shame, the curses of the
criminal or the sweat of the taxpayer. The Demo
cratic party has been trained to do his lifting as
that nice old gentleman, Mr. Fagin. trained Oliver
We suppose there are moments when Colonel
F.yran rests from his labor of carrying his whole be-
Ic ved Country on his brick and lays the United States
down, as a mother does her baby. If such moment3
there be. will Colonel Bryan, while he keeps the flies
ail the mewlinj? and puking republic, please tell us
what he thinks of the contrast between Thomas Jef
ferson and Dick Croker? We may then judge of the
degeneracy of a party that has declined from the
statesman who founded it to the boss who drives it
as he docs one of his English coach horses.
Since thut landing of the boss of all bosses there
has been nothing in sight but Bryan's nomination.
Before that even the boy orator himself saw a sec
ond nomination only through a glass darkly. Since
then he h;is seen it t'ace to. face, and with his natural
eye.
For the first time, in many a year the party is en
tirely in the hands of Tammany. Croker has reached
a position of national boss to which Tweed and John
KeHy aspired. in vain. In their day the Democracy
was fractious and skittish, and shied from Tammany
control. It had in it the fierce spirit of Tilden, who
ran Tammany out of New York and hunted Tweed
i.r Â¦Â¦-.:Â¦'. the world and brought him back to prison and
to punishment; But that spirit has faded out, and a
man more offensive than Tweed, albeit a neater
looter and rr.ore artistic lifter of the dividends of po
litical management, is accepted without qualm or
question as the boss.
7" HE Democratic campaign has one man
aging director, one boss. True, there 15
a National Committee, and Senator Jones
is, and is to be, its chairman. But the real
directing intelligence is Richard Croker.
He has dictated Tammany's support of Colonel
Uryan for the nomination, and is the director
general of the party. Nothing is dorre until Mr.
Crofciar is heard from. It was supposed last year that
he would oppose Bryan, and the Saratoga conference
Â»as called to groom *nd bring out another candidate.
It was timed to meet on Mr. Croker's arrival in New
York, on a visit from his estate in England. The
gi^2 :'- Â¦;:; arrived and shouted for Bryan as soon as
:::.- foot touched his American estate, which is the
city of New York and all that therein is. The Sara
toga conference adjourned without day and left no
mark to indicate thai it ever had been at all.

What Americans Really Know
About Bewitching Geishas
Moreover, it is to be borne in mind that most of
the buildings in Chinatown are overcrowded. If that
be stopped a considerable number of the Chinese will
have to move out of that district. Thus an emigra
tion from the quarter will have been begun without
anv resort to extraordinary means to bring it about.
When once begun the drift of the race will be to the
new quarter,; and little by little old Chinatown will
disappear of. itself. Â¦' " : :
.; Be,thatvas it itiay, the immediate work imposed
upon the authorities is that of cleaning up Chinatown
ss it stands and the enforcement within its limits of
every ordinance of the city. AVe have now in session
a new Grand Jury. To that body the people have a
right to look for earnest work in the direction of this
reform. The jury should make a comprehensive and
a thorough inspection of Chinatown, and should re
port every violation of the law which may come un
der notice. That- is; the duty! of the time. If the
Grand Jury fail in its work it may be necessary to re
sort to a committee of citizens, but it is hardly likely
the Grand Jury will fail. The violations of law are
too gross and flagrant to be hidden from an honest
inspection, and with popular sentiment aroused as it
is now no member of the jury, however partial he
may be to some of thewealthy property-owners of the
j locality, would venture upon whitewashing a violation
of the: law when making a report upon the situation.
The Chinatown nuisance is made up of a host of
violations of law. If the owners of property in the
district be compelled to have their buildings put in
proper repair, supplied with adequate plumbing, sewer
connections and fire escapes/kept clean and well ven
tilated, and free from overcrowding either above
ground or below ground, much of the Chinatown
nuisance Will be abated. It is fairly certain that many
of the old rookeries; in Chinatown would not be
profitable to their wealthy owners if the city ordi
nances were enforced in that district as in other lo
calities^ and consequently the enforcement of the law
would compel' the owners of such buildings either to
tear them down and erect better structures, or else
make extensive repairs upon them\^
I ; ULL justification is to be found in Chinatown
I . ; for the project of those who favor the removal
- Â¦ of; the Chinese from that locality, and should it
ever become necessary to enter upon the achieve
ment of the project there will not be lacking popu
lar support to sustain it. At present, however, it is
not needed. There is: a simpler remedy which if thor
oughly tried may prove sufficient to eliminate : the
evils of which the public complain. That remedy
it is in the power of the municipal authorities to ap
ply. It is nothing more than the enforcement of the
health ordinances of the city.

forces knows not what kind of a God's universe he
lives in; he will never realize, as it should be real
ized, the inevitableness of cause and effect, and he will
be in perpetual danger of mistaking for truth the
poetic fictions of half-thinkers. Enough mathematics
to develop in him the idea of necessary relation the

French or German and in his own language, literature

: A boy who faithfully follows â or can be made to
followâ such a course of study for two years knows
where he stands in the intellectual world; he is then
fit to choose his advanced study or specialty; he is
hardly fit before. If he finds the curriculum as here
sketched hard or distasteful, that simply means that
he has not i braiins enough to take a higher education,
and that he had better desist from the attempt to get
one. .Â¦Â¦ : ; .'Â¦ .Â¦Â¦. ; ':Â¦Â¦ 'Â¦. . Â¦''.Â¦'Â¦ â¢>Â¦â¢â¢.â¢.Â¦Â¦ Â¦ ; â¢ : ; .-' ; . . â¢.
The donors of the ' wines- given to them for hos

ducts are injuriously discredited and the money is

We regard the action of the commission as inflict
ing a deeper injury; than the exclusion of bur wines
f;om competition, since it is their official indorsement
of a most prejudiced end harmful judgment.
When one thinks of it, there is a feeling of wonder
that the Commissioners do not .snub the Fourth of
July, instead of celebrating it, .It is quite an Ameri
can institution, and should take its chances with the
American products which have been ruled out by the
officers sent there to see that they have a fair chance
in the world's competition and under the world's eye.
We do : not Â¦ wish to be understood as attaching
blame to Mr. de Young. He was the guest of the
California Commission, and of course had to eat hay
and drink stump water if the Commissioners set it be
fore him. v . \< Â¦Â¦*
How can the State expect any different treatment
from what it is getting at the exposition, when its offi
cial representatives snub its own products and piitits
wines on the swill list, instead of giving them place ; on
the bill of fare at their official functions? : Â¦. ;.
Of course our taxpayers and wine-growers will feel
like leapfrogging each other to pay for a Fourth of
July spread in which California wines will be discred
ited by this remarkable commission. Â¦Â¦Â¦'Â¦ . :,
Indeed, the commission seems to have officially ac
quiesced in the condemnation of our wines. It was
furnished with a complete variety of wine in large
quantities, to be used in private and official hospital
ity. The only official function of which we have no
tice, in which our commission has been the host, was
an elaborate banquet given to Commissioner M. H.
dc Young. A copy of the highly illuminated menu
has been received. The affair was at the Hotel Ritz,
on June 6. The menu was gotten up as a souvenir,
and the banquet was at the expense, of this State, paid
for out of the $130,000 appropriated for the use of this
commission. In the menu is the list of wines used at
the feast and paid for by the taxpayers^ of this St^te,
and there is not a single California wine in the lot!
Our wines have heretofore been shown in interna
tional expositions and have had award? certifying
their high merits. They are now better ilian ever.
The industry is older. The vintage is better under
stood. The industry has now embarked in it the capi
tal necessary to carry our wines to proper bottling
age, and they reach the market in better form than
ever. But, by submission to intrigue, or inattention
to duty, they have been excluded from competition,
and are put of the lunning entirely. The pretext
upon which this has been done is that they bear
French names. Therefore our apricots and prunes
should be ruled out because they go under the same
name as apricots and prunes produced elsewhere. It
might have occurred to some one in our sumptuous
outfit of Commissioners that they bear French names
btcause our vineyards have been planted from French
stock, which has retained the names borne in France.
The presence of a wine expert like Charles Wctmore
or Captain Niebaum or Mr. Rossi would have been
felt beneficially by this State. But none such was
present. It is noted by returned visitors to Paris that
in many other respects we have got the worst of it
in the management of our affairs by the commission.
We will celebrate the Fourth of July at home and the
commission can do the star-spangled act in Paris, if
some one does not forbid its use of "Old Glory," be
cause its stars and stripes are the same color as the
French tricolor, in which event we suppose it will
submit as it has to every other encroachment offered.
We decline to contribute to this festive occasion in
the French capital. California has not fared so well
at the hands of the State and Federal Commission as
to induce a festive feeling at such long range.
THE California Commission to the Paris Expo
sition calls upon the newspapers to contribute
money toward a Fourth of July celebration in
Paris, under its auspices. ' â¢

Miss Hobbs' Power of Ratiocination
Michael and His Lost Angel.
By L. Du Pont Syle.
--* N the third act of Jerome's play. "Miss Hobbs the hero
W reads the heroine a lecture on â¢ the : "Whole Duty of
H Woman" that might have been drawn from the Data .01
1 Ethics" of Herbert Spencer, and that certainly would ha\e
I saturated with delight the soul of that sympathetic old
Â¦â¢ bachelor. Without reservation woman is told that net
highest duty is to be found In the rearing of children, ana
It is taken for granted that in the exercise of this ao-caÂ»ea
highest duty she will find also her highest pleasure. This last
supposition, bo It noted, is one that commands a wider assent
from men than from women. In this: age good and intelligent
women abound to whom the rearing of children does not appeal
as the whole duty of woman and to whom the prospect thereof
afforflsT little or no pleasure. Such women commonly remain
unmarried, and who shall say for them that they have not
chosen the better part? Although they could not express it as
well as did Karon Verulam. they probably give at least a half
hearted assent to the cruel half-truth In which that worthy
has declared that "wives are young ntfen's mistresses, compan
ions for middle age and old men's nurses." If Miss Hobbs had
known enough to quote this understanding^ in reply to Mr.
Kingsearl's exhortations to cease her "chatter about art" I
think that young man. judged by the evident limitation of his
own ideas, would have been at a loss for a reply. But Miss
Hobbs had clearly never thought seriously upon the woman
question, for her deepest convictions are shaken by the rude
breath ascending from an uncookable mutton chop and the
shattering of her faith in coffee as a powder drives her for sup
port to the manly breast of the hero, who revealed to her that
coffee is a berry.
This is pretty fair farce, Mr. Jerome, but pray don t call it
comedy.

Much of the Ibsen drama is a protest against the Spencer-
Jerome statement of the "Whole Duty of Woman." Ibsen is
never weary of proclaiming and Bernard Shaw of echoing that
a woman has a duty to herself as well as to her husband and
her children. This truth has been so little recognized hereto
fore that perhaps the overemphasis of these zealots is neces
sary to make men realize that when they make women what
Bacon describes them they make them slaves, and that where
slavery is there can be no true love.

To us cold-blooded Saxons the actors in such a scene appÂ«ar
ridiculous, and we think with inward satisfaction of how dif
ferently we would have behaved on such an occasion. But
in luch inatters nothing i3 really absolute, everything is com
parative: manners, customs and beliefs to us commendable and
sometimes even sacred, to others appear as ridiculous as do
hdrs to us. For instance, more than three thousam 1 years ago
experience had taught the Aryan races and a portion of the
Semitic that murder, adultery and false witness are crimes of
the first magnitude, which should be punished with the severest
penalties of the law; yet not many years aco a divined
Arabian chUf tain (living not far from Mount Sinai â¢) assured
Mr Palgrave (Spencer. "Study of Sociology." chapter XII)

One of the worst features of our long-run system la that a
play which is to fit into that system must make a hit within the
nrst week or be quickly shelved. This is not a fair test of the
quality of a play, for half a dozen circumstances beyond the
author's control may cause a play worth many representations
to produce a poor effect on the first night. Many a good play
has been fost to the stage either through the actors' Incapacity
to grasp the author's character conceptions or to express those
conceptions when grasped. Many a good play has .ailed
through being produced at the wrong time or at an unsuitable
theater or before an audience incapable of appreciating what
* a some such misfortune or combination of misfortunes must
have befallen Henry Arthur Jones' play. "Michael and His
Lost Angel." one of the most touching and poetical tragedies
of modern times. This play was produced at the Lyceum The
ater. London, some three or four years ago and rail only ten
nights. No satisfactory explanation of its sudden withdrawal
has ever come to my notice, and Mr. Jones' hope that he may
again introduce it to the English public under happier auspices
has never so far as I can discover been realized.
Here is a chance for Mr. Miller. The part of Michael
Faversham is a better part than that of Sydney Carton good
as that is. and the part of Audrie Lesden offers to an emotional
actress however talented a psychological study that will tax
her powers to the utmost.

that the fingers on his other hand had

Burglars made a bold attempt to steal
the hoarded treasure of S. Cohen, an aged
tailor, at GOIVs "Washington street, on Fri
day night. They were interrupted in their
operations by a special policeman and. beat
a hasty retreat Just as they had almost
got their hands on several thousand dol
lars. A report of the matter was made to
the California-street station, and the po
lice believe they have a clew to the per
petrators of the job.
Cohen conducts his shop In a dingy little
room near Montgomery street, and few
people euessed that he kept any money
in the place. But he did. His savings of
years, amounting to a sum in the thou
sands, had been spread out on the bottom
of an old trunk. A few of his friends
knew of the existence of 'the money and
often advised the old man to either secure
an iron safe or to transfer it to a secure
place,* but the latter refused to listen to
their warnings and continued to trust to
the novelty of his hiding place to protect
him from thieves.
On Friday night two burglars pried off
the lock on the door of the establishment
shortly before midnight. They entered
and Immediately applied their jimmies to
the fastenings of the old trunk. These
yielded freely, but before the money was
reached Special Officer Cochran came in
sight and the two men abandoned their
Job and fled. The police Immediately en
tered the place and came to the conclusion
that the would-be thieves were well ac
quainted with the premises. Cohen has
now transferred his wealth to a stronger
box. Â¦;

The Board of Health last evening ap
pointed Drs. W. R. Dorr, F. R. Starr, L.
D. Bacigalupi, Victor Putnam, F. R. Dray
and F. B. Robinson to be assistant emer
gency surgeons as a result of the drawing
of lots held earlier in the day. The first
three were assigned to the Harbor Hospi
tal and the others to the Central Hospital.
The twelve assistant emergency sur
geons met in the morning for the purpose
of taking a vote on the resolution adopted
by the board directing them to draw lots
to determine who should be retained in
their positions. As told exclusively in
The Call yesterday morning the board had
receded from its original intention to con
tinue six of their favorites in their posi
tions and to dismiss the other six. Drs.
Thompson, Thorne, Dorr, Putnam, Morrl
eon and Armstead had agreed to stand to
gether in opposing the drawing of lots as
being unprofessional. Dr. Robinson, after
mucn persuasion, decided to join the mal
contents and gave his proxy to Thorna.
Drs. McGettlgan, Vander Leith, Starr
(whose proxy was held by Dray), Baciga
lupl and Dray were in the minority when
a vote was to have been taken and tho
resolution would have been accepted when
Rcbinson walked In, repudiated his agree
ment with Thorne and voted with the
five who favored tho drawing of lots. The
vote then stood 6 to 6 and the order of
the board to draw lots had to be com
plied with. Those who drew blanks and
lost their places are Drs. Thompson.
Thome, Armstead, Morrison and McGtet
tigan.
The ten assistant sanitary inspectors
also drew lots, the successful ones being
Drs. Keenan, W. S. .Hereford, H. V. Gra
ham, R. E. Hartley and A. Greene. The
losing five who were dismissed by the
board are Drs. Trueholtz, Fitzgibbons,
Bothe, Pamlicki and Hassler.
Of the ten food inspectors the following
named were dismissed on account of the
alleged Insufficient appropriation: C. J.
Staude and E. T. Murphy. Bath and
Laundry Inspector James Daley and Mar
ket Inspector O'Leary were also decapi
tated.
Assistant Vaccinator McPherson, Assist
ant Bacteriologist Donnelly and Assistant
Chemist Brandt will also be dismissed.
By the dismissals thua made the salary
roll was reduced by $1725 per month. Sec
retary- Brown's salary was cut from $175
to $150 per month; Legal Adviser Dunne's
salary was raised from ?100 to $125. and
DIsinterment Inspector L. Walsh was cut
from $100 to $75 per month. Bakery In
spector Bergez will act as laundry in
spector.
The following: successful contestants in
the recent competition examination were
appointed internes in the City and County
Hospital for one year: Drs. O'Connor.
Osmers and Cunningham to the Cooper
Medical College wards; -Drs. Harvey,
Reinhart, Saph and Pratt to wards of
medical department. University of Cali
fornia; Dr. Watts to wards of the San
Francisco Polyclinic.
Attorney Dunne advised the board that
the 25 per cent cut sustained during April
and May by the employes of the City and
County Hospital might be collected from
the city If the Board of Supervisors would
pass an ordinance covering the point. The
board will be requested to pass such an
ordinance.

The enrollment since June 23 of 5000 Re
publican voters is accepted by the County
Committee as assrance that the decuent
men of the party have taken In hand the
good work of turning down the bosses.
Among the Republicans.who have signified
by enrollment a determination to take an
active interest in public affairs are many
citizens who never before joined a political
club.
When the Republican County Committee
adopted a simple and orderly plan of or
ganizing an official club in each Assembly
district the estimates placed the probable
total enrollment at 3CKW. Reports received
last night indicate that 5000 men have en
listed for the campaign. The Thirty-fourth
District reports an enrollment of 450, the
Thirty-ninth 340, the Forty-first 250, the
Forty-second 130, the Forty-third 446 and
the Forty-fourth 500.
It was suspected that Kelly and Crim
mins would send out stutters, hoping to
secure their enrollment by false pretenses.
In several districts stuffers were permit
ted to sign, but the bona fide residents of
the districts wherein the fraud was per
petrated know the names of the stuffers
and will see that such names 'are ex
punged. In the Forty-third District some
of the rawest work was done. Several
days ago The Call directed attention to
the complaints which had been made
against John J. Curry, a county commit
teeman of that district. He was formerly
a Democrat and ran for State Printer on
the ticket with James H. Budd. Later
on he set himself up as an anti-Crimmins
Republican. Proof can be produced that
he permitted non-residents of the Forty
third to sign the roll of that district. Re
cently two young men who were known
to live on Tehama street Â¦went up and
had their names put on the roll of tho
Forty-third as living at 103 Ellis street.
Neither one resides there nor in the dis
trict. After they had given their ad
dresses falsely they were questioned by
an acquaintance concerning- their reasons
for so doing. They confessed that Crim
mins and "Saxy" Solomon asked them to
sign the roll or the Forty-third Assembly
District. Their story is that they were
invited to drink four or five times and
that the same persons put up round after
round of drinks for the crowd. Evidently
there was "money to burn" and some one
standing ready to put It up for colonizers.
The names or these two young men who
fraudulently signed are known and the
facts are attested to by Republicans who
are trusted in the councils of the party.
The two young men said that Crlmmlna and
Solomon were opposed to the "straight
laced" element in the party. The situa
tion is up against Curry. Proof will be
furnished to his satisfaction, if required,
that the names on the roll of the Forty
third District are 'there wrongfully In
these two instances and In others. There
are said to be at least eighty coloniza
tions in that one district. The test of
Curry's sincerity as a purist will be
whether he will have the fraudulently en
rolled names stricken off. If he will not
it will be evident that he winks and con
nives at the frauds.
At the outset the County Committee
had little hope of wresting the Twenty
eighth -and Twenty-ninth districts from
the control of the degraded bosses. Hence
no particular effort was made to encour
age decent Republicans to sign the roll
of the official club in these districts. The
best citizens of the party, however, can
win the districts at the primary election
by putting In the field a clean, anti-boss
delegate ticket. Kelly and Crimmins can
not win a district in the town in a square,
open flght. Of all the contemptible and
corrupt bosses that ever disgraced a co.m
munity, they are the lowest and most de
spicable. Knowing^ something of the de
rision in which they are held, they pro
claim hostility to their own candidates in
order to mislead the voters. When the
delegate tickets are put up in the
Twenty-eighth. Twenty-ninth, Thlrty T nrst
and Forty-fifth Assembly districts The
Call will point out the candidates who
wear the brand of Kelly and Crimmins.
It Is known that several 'members of the
Republican County Committee are doing
politics under cover with Crimmins. There
Is no positive proof that Committeeman
Curry of the Forty-third Is a tool of the
bosses. He is probably a dupe. When the
proof Is presented to him that he has been
duped We may join in the efforts to elim
inate stuffers from the official club of the
Forty-third District.
An attempt was made by stuffers last
night to pet on thÂ« rolls at the Thirty
fourth District, but they were promptly
sentawav by citizens of thÂ« district.
In sending out rounders to sipn club
rolls Kelly and Crimmins hope to gain a
point in the permanent organization of
the clubs and thus have a voice in 1 making
up the delegate tickets to be voted for at
the primary election. The stuffers, of
course, cannot vote In a district where
they do- not reside, but they may be able
to create disturbance in a few of the dis
tricts when the time comes to permanent
ly organize the clubs. As all the clubs will
meet for permanent organization on the
evening or July 9 the stuffers will not be
able to cover more than three or four dls-
Between this time and July 9 the County
Committee can perform the excellent work
of striking from the rolls all those who

"that when the order to hoist anchor was
given the current swept the battle?hip
toward the rock, and before her engines
could give her headway she struck."
Mr. Wu. the Chinese Minister, said to
day that this particular spot was a grave
yard of shipping.
So far us officers of the department are
able to p'at the position of the ship with
the incomplete Information at hand, they
believe that the Oregon must have been
carried by the current east-southeast and
that the tide must have been at its flood.
In' this event there is danger that the
ship will settle on the rock, ripping a
still larerT hole In her bottom, making It
impossible for her to be floated.
The difference, between the rise and fall

belief that the United Btates Is to supply food,
rebuild their houses and give them all the'
necessaries of life for an Indefinite period. It
seems impossible to make them understand
that the aid was only intended to title : them
over and enable them to recover from' the sreat
disaster. They seem Indisposed to replant their
crops, and when January 1. 1P00. arrived (the
date which General Davis had fixed for dis
continuing food issues) the evidence of suffer
ing was so great that I was forced to recom
mend Its continuance. The amount of food Is
sued, however, was reduced as far as was
compatible with actual need, and S7."0.000 was
appointed for work that a large number of la
borers might .be thus employed and effective
aid extended. ; An aggregate of 100,000 rations
dally is now being issued, however. Should
all applications be considered favorably, the is
sues would amount to nearly half a m'illioit ra
tions each day, at a cost of $23,000.
These 1?fucs are pauperizing the people and
Instilling into their minds the idea that, they
have only to refuse to work to be supported by
the Government. In the opinion of Governor
Allen, relief supplies should not be sent to
Porto Rico In the future, and supplies should
be furnished no longer to the larger and more
prosperous planters, but should he given 'only
to the smaller planters and to these for only
a short time loncer. â¢ -
General Davis recommends action ac
cording to these views, and accordingly
the Secretary of War has directed him to
cease the distribution of rations in Porto
Rico on July 15, and to give early notica
of this intention, so that all citizens may
understand the necessity of making
other arrangements than now exist.
RAILROADS LOSE.
PORTLAND . June 30.â In the United
States District Court to-day Judge Bel
linger handed down a decision in ti;o case
of Allen; & Lewis, representing the
wholesale grocers of Portland, against
the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Com
pany and the Oregon Short Line Railroad
Company. The decision to-day was
against the railroad companies. Tho de
cision, however, was not on tht. merits of
the case, but on an application of the
Oregon Short Line to 'withdraw from the
suit on the ground that the court had no
jurisdiction, the Short Line being a sepa

In the original suit plaintiffs contended
that the rates of the Short Line and the
Oregon Railroad and Navigation com
panies into Idaho territory discriminate
against Portland jobbers and in favor of
San Kranclsco Jobbers, which is contrary
to the interstate commerce law.
Judge Bellinger held that the applica

Stand Together.
Special (Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, June SO.â The hill people
and the longshore people of Sausalito are
busy signing a petition to be presented
to the Sausalito Board of Health: The
petition ask3 that a certain nuisance in
the shape of an unfilled pond on Water
street be abated. - ,'-Â¦'Â¦'Â¦Â¦".
The pond In question Is a portion of
Sausallto's water front, which has been
bulkheadeu in and allowed to remain un
filled save with stagnant water. The ob
jectionable spot is located next the rail
road wharf and Impresses Its presence
very forcibly upon those going on and off
the boat.
For the first time in many years the
good people of Sausalito find themselves
united in- thought and action. Political
rivalry and the poolroom war have been
forgotten In the battle now being waged
against the nimble microbe.
The petition contains a dozen "where
ases" and the words "nuisance." "dis
grace," "good health threatened," "stran
gers disgusted with appearance" find a
prominent place.

tcm through which the company obtained
some of its most efficient officers. At the
conclusion- of his leave Philip, af r^r a
short cruise In the Adams, obtained com
mand of the Woodruff scientific expedi
tion around the world. He served subse
quently on deep-sea surveying, as light
house inspector and on duty at Mare Isl
and up to his promotion to captain In 1SS3,
when he went East, and after a two
years' cruise In the Atlanta took charge
as general inspector of the cruiser New
York, in â¢which he made a cruise.
His subsequent service In the Texas la a
matter of recent history of the battle off
Santiago, In which his ship took a prom
inent part. A most gallant fighter, he Â¦was
also a man of deep religious feeling and
kindness of heart,- and it wa9 he who for
bade his men to cheer at the sinking of
one of the Spanish ships, saying: "Don't
cheer, boys?: those poor fellows are dying."
Later, whtn the battle was ended, he
called on every one on the Texas to bare
his head In silent thanksgiving, and him
self publicly acknowledged his belief In
and gratitude to God.
On January 19, 1S99, Philip was assigned
to the coveted post of commandant of the
Brooklyn navy yard. >
"Jack" Philip, as his crew were wont
to name him, was the personification of a.
typical sailor officer, a polished gentleman
and a devout Christian. He had all of the
good qualities and traits of the perfect of
ficer and none of the follies of the sea
farer. His wife â a Californian â and two
children constitute the charge left by the
gallant Philip to the country which he
served so well.
THE LATE REAR ADMIRAL JOHN "WOODWARD PHILIP.
-K/"T-E"W YORK, June 30.â Rear Admiral
JU>I Philip, commandant of the Brook
lyn Navy Yard, died at 3:15 o'clock this
afternoon of heart disease.
Rear Admiral John Woodward Philip
was born in New York August 26, 1840,
and entered the Naval Academy at thj
age of 16- The outbreak of the civil war
offered opportunities for the young mia
shlpmcn to at once enter upon the serious
practical duties of their profession, and
when Philip wrote a letter to the Secre
tary of the Navy asking to be given a
position of responsibility he was promptly
promoted to acting 1 master and ordered to
the sailing sloop Marion. He served on
the blockading squadrons and the James
River fleet and was severely wounded in
the Stono River engagement, 1863. Pro
moted to lieutenant in 1S62. he rose to the
grade of lieutenant commander two years
later, and became a commander In 1874. in
which grade he remained until 1899, when
promoted to captain, and reached the
rank of rear admiral on March 3, 1S90.
Rear Admiral Philip had the enviable
distinction of having a longer sea service
record than any other officer on the active
list, which, including his command of Pa
cific Mail steamers, footed up to twenty
three years, out of forty-three years ten
months total service. He had very little
inclination for office work and yam rou
tine duty, and up to-the time of his mar
riage was almost constantly at sea. From
lS"^ to 1*7G Philip was the popular com
mander of the Pacific Mail steamer City
of Peking, and introduced the cadet sys-

WHEN DOCTORS DISAGREE
What Becomes of the Patient?
Doctors have their hobbles as well _as
other people and In the treatment or aia-
ease often carry them too far for the pa-
tient's pood. For instance in the treat-
ment of indigestion or dyspepsia many
doctors give bismuth and nothing ewe.
others rely on pepsin to bring their pa-
tients through, still another doctor treats
stomach troubles with the various vege-
table essences and fruit salts.
Now one or the other of these excellent
remedies becomes a hobby with the doc-
tor who has had most success with the
particular one in question, because all of
them are flrst-clas3 remedies for indiges-
tion and dyspepsia, but not one of them
alcne is so good as a combination or all
of them, such as is found in Stuart 9
Dyspepsia Tablets, which contains not
on'y vegetable essences and fruit salts.
but also the freshest, purest pepsin and
bismuth, making altogether a remedy un-
surpassed for every form of indigestion,
sour stomach, nervous dyspepsia, belch-
ing of gas. distress after eating, sleep-
lessness, headaches, etc.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets Is not a se-
cret r<*nent nostrum, but you can see for
yourself what it is. and knowing this, its
success as a dyspepsia cure is not sur-
prising. All druggists recommend and
sell them at 50 cents.

GRAPE-NUTS.^
CHANGE IN FOOD
Works Wonders in Health.
; It is worth knowing that a change in
food can cure dyspepsia- ''I decrn :t ray
GKty to let you 'know hox. Grape-Nuts
Â¦ food ha -cured me of indigestion.
"I 'Lad. been troubjed with it fpr years,,
until last year my doctor recommended
Grape-Nuts food'to be used every morn- :
ing. I folio-vved in>tructions and no* I
zin entirely Well. ' "'A. Â¦'Â¦Â¦Â¦ .' â¢; .
"The whole family :. like Grape^Nuts. j
We use four packages a *reek. You are
welcome to use this testimonial as: you
see fit. I 2m williog to give any imor-.
mation to any one who desires itbfsee.
or urite me regarding * Grapc-Xuts.-'-
Pcspectfuliy. Mrs.C. K. Lovi^, 6Sl Par-
ker street. Roxburyv.Mass.- ; : | : : 'J .-';\
The reason Mrs. Lowe was helped by
the uÂ«c of Grape-Xuts food: is that the
food is rredigested by natural processes
and therefore does not tax the stomach
as jhe food she had been, using; it also
contains the elements required for build-
ing up the nervous system. If that part
of the human body is in perfect. work-
ing order there can be . no dj'spepsia,. for
nervous .energy represents the steam
that drives the engine. .
When the nervous system is run down
the machinery of the body works badly.
Grape-Nuts food can be used by Â£nali
children as well as adults. It is per-
fectly cooked and ready for instant use.

ANDREW UDEN GETS -.
â¢ r : AN INVOLUNTARY BATH
Thomas and David Crowley Arrested
for Throwing- Him Headlong
Into the Bay.
.Andrew Uden, a sailor on the revenue
cutter Hartley, swore to a complaint in
Judge Conlan's court yesterday for the
arrest of Thomas and David Crowley, the
well-known boatmen, on a charge of bat
tery.. ..They were arrested and released on
$20 cash bail.
The cutter was lying at section B of the
seawall yesterday morning. She is receiv
ing a. new coat of paint, and when Tom
Crowley rowed alongside yesterday morn
ing Uden warned him to look out for the
paint.. Crowley called Uden "a . dâ d
Swede," and Uden became belligerent, as
Crowley Is the smallest man on the water
front. While they were arguing Crowley's
brother Dave came alongside in his ga?o
line launch and joined in the discussion
about the paint. Then there was trouble.
"Tom hit me. on the neck." said Uden.
"and knocked me down. Then they both
grabbed me and threw me overboard. I
tried to get on board, but they would not
let me, and I swam to the cutter Golden
Gate and was hauled onto that vessel.
After I had exchanged my wet clothes for
dry ones I went to- the harbor police sta
tion to get the Crowleys arrested and was
advised to swear out a warrant."

The fact that he never used the gas

are indicative of suicide; but the- key of
the gas burner was so loose that the gas
Could be turned on with tho lightest touch.
A towel which Westphai had used in dry

Sale of Land Ordered.
James Porter died in Sonoma three years
ago, leaving a large estate of real and
personal property, and left no will. -He
left no known heirs. In the Probate Court
the Judge found that the real estate was
expensive to maintain and properly man
age; that the orchards and vineyards
could not be leased to advantage because
there was no house> on the land. However,
the lower, court decided that it had no
right to order the sale of the land as re
quested by the administrator, T. G.
Young. The latter appealed to the Su
preme Court, which yesterday directed
that the lower court order the sale. ;

ASHAMED TO SWEAR
TO THE COMPLAINT
Policemen. Robinson and Schmidt
Shirk the Responsibility of Ar
resting Thomas Nelson.
Thomas Kelson, the 10-year-old hoy
charged with burglary, appeared before
Judge Conlan yesterday. There was M
complaint on file and the Judge intimated
that when the case was called to-morrnw
If no complaint had been filed he would
dismiss it. HÂ© exonerated the boy's sure
ties and allowed him to go on his own
recognizance.
Policemen Robinson and Schmidt, who
dragged the boy out of bed and locked
him up In the "tanks" all night, would
not swear to a complaint, and wanted
William Helblng, the contractor, from
whom the boy was alleged to have stolen
some brass hinges, to do so, but Helhlng
refused. So the matter rests.
Chief Sullivan did not object to the of
ficers dragging the boy out of bed. but ad
mitted that they did wrong tn putting hlra
in the "tanks" and not charging him at
once. The boy who did steal the brass
hinges has not yet been arrested, although
the police know where to find him. ThÂ«
arrest of Nelson has aroused cons!derab!Â«
feeling In the Mission, where his parenU
are well known and respected.
roon was due Bolely to the kindly inter
->-Â»-neiÂ»n of tsxe. Greg-gains' duty calls him
ca'ly to the ocean beach, where with gath
ered ren he jmtrols the b*jarh in search of
i he lawless. While in the performance of
his doty yesterday afternoon he passed
ground the corner of the Ocean Beach Pa
vilion and headed his horse toward the
eld railway station.
Without an ir.stant's -warning the borae
lunged as!(Je. ar.d as the saddle girth had
l;ercme loosened through hours of use the
saddle turned ar.d the officer was hurled
headlong to the ground. One foot, how
ever, remained fast in the stirrup, and
OreggaJr.s' fight for life began. The horse,
frenzi^d with 'ear. threw his heels with
vicious energy toward his prostrate mas
ter and then lunged oft down the road,
firpppair.s was toesed from side to Bide,
perhaps but a few seconds, and then the
uran-csod heels of the horse struck him
with vicionG force on the hip. tossing him
aside ar.d free. His foot slipped from the
stirrup and this alone saved /him from; a
shocking- death. - Â¦ .Â¦..Â¦â¢Â¦ ; - ;' Â¦' ; f '
Onlookers, who during the wild plunging
of the animal had remained stricken with
fear, hurried to jhe officer's assistance.
They carried him to the Beactr Tavern
and aid was summoned. 'In the meantime
his horse went plunging ' down the road;
with each leap making a mad effort to
free himself from the saddle that swayed
beneath his body. The runaway attracted
the attention of other park officers. Who
lassoed him and took him back to the
scene of Greggains' accident. ' '.Â¦."<* â¢ . â¢. .

sufficiently, to aid In. the search for his

where it had fallen when torn loose. from

bruised and ;spre. Greggains made his way
to the station, reported his misfortune
and then tui-ned toward his home.. Officer
Greggains. like those who witnessed it,
marveled at his escape. ; He; may be back

The thirteenth annual tennis tourna
ment for the single championship of the
Pacific States was commenced yesterday
at San Rafael. The preliminary and first
rounds were played, narrowing the con
testants down to eight. One feature of
the tournament was that every match was
won in straight sets. It was again a. repe
tition of the old storyâ the Oakland and
Alameda men defeating the San Francisco
racket-wielders player after player until
there remains but one man. W. B. Collier,
to uphold the honor of the California
Club, the other seven players being Oak
land or Alameda Club men. :-.}; ;.?;.â¢
The si^-prise of the day came when Reu
ben Hunt of Alameda defeated R. N.
Whitney, as predicted by The Call, in
three straight sets. The majority of the
spectators imagined It was a walkover
for Wnitney.
Play was called at 10.15 a. m. and C. B.
Root vs. Alex Stewart and Grant Smith
vs. Samuel Hardy were the teams to start
proceedings.
Dr. C B. Root of the California Club
defeated Alex Stewart of the Oakland
Club, 6â2. 6â1. 6â1. In this match Root
played aggressively and steadily, his fore
and back drives being productive of many
clean aces. Stewart's drive was a trifle
wild, causing him to knock many balls
out of the court.
Samuel Hardy defeated Grant Smith
easily. 6â2. 6â2. 6â2. Smith was nervous
and did not put up his regular smashing
game.
Kobert AYhitney defeated Percy Kahn
6â3, 6â2. 7â5. Kahn played" a good game
for a beginner and passed Whitney often
with his drive.
Merle Johnson won from M. Leventritt
by default. Crowell won from R. Nichol
son by default. J. O'Brien defeated Alan
Owen! 6â0. l >â\. 6â1. O'Brien's drives and
thf- heat of the day were the undoing of
Otven.
Reuben Hunt defeated James A. Code in
a slow match. Code was certainly away
oft in his play, but Hunt woi'ld have won
in any event, as he put up a brilliant
came." playing all his shots safe. Score
<i â 1. f>â 2. 6â2.
W. B. Collier Jr. defeated Fred Brown
of Alameda. 6-0. 6â4. 10-S. This was
Brown's first tournament and he lost the
tirst set mainly through nervousness to
the veteran Collier. The next two sets
were evenly contested and several times
it looked as if Brown would pull out one
set. His strokes were superior to Collier's,
btingr similar to Sumner Hardy's, but he
lacked experience.
The be?t contested match and the only
surprise of the day was when Robert
Whitney went down to defeat before the
steady pla.y end careful passing of Reu
ben Hunt by a score of 6â3. 6â2. 6â2.
Whitney was considered a 1 to 5 favorite,
and it certainly looked as if his aggressive
and terrific drives would pull him through
a winner. Hunts steadiness proved too
much for Whitney. The latter essayed
drives from back of the court, but was
disheartened by Hunt's constant return of
the ball.
Whitney would then lose the point by
driving into the net or out of the court.
Whitney's strongest strokes are his
smashing of lobs, but he did not play at
the net as usual, as Hunt lobbed few
balls to him. Whitney changed his game
lafer on and began to try â¢ backhand i and
forehand drives, but this was of no avail.
It was simply a case of Hunt letting
Whitnr-v defeat himself.
Percy Murdock won by default from T.
Murdock. O'Brien beat Bishop More
land by default in the second round.
Samuel Hardy won from Johnson, 6 â 1,
0â2. 6â0. Sumner Hardy defeated Root,
6â0. fiâ 2. fiâ 2. Root played a good vol
leyinp pame and it was a, closer contest
than the score would indicate.
Will Cook riV-tent^d Paul Jones. 7â5.
f, â 4. 6â 2. Jnnes played a good pame at
times, but was unsteady at critical staces.
W. Allen defeateu Percy Bailey, 6â2, 6â3,
eâ 1.
Â¦\Vhen the ColIier-Cro-well match was
railed all the seats were filled with spec
tators, as both these players are great
favorites in San Rafael. Onirfon wis
evenly divided as to the winner, but her*
acatn the steadiness of Collier pulled mm
tbj-oujrh. Crowell played a briUlant
game, smashing well, but unsteadily. The
score was 6â 3. 6â 4, 6â2. This was the
last match of the cay and finished the
first round. The following players are
still In the tournament: Percy Murdock,
J. O'Brien. Samuel Hardy. Sumner Har

READY FOR THE
RACE MEET AT
SITU ROSA
Special . Dispatch to The Call.
DENVER, June 30.â California owners
in both the harness and running events
have" been but. lightly represented at the
meeting, here which opened on June Sf.
Tha majority of gallopers hail from Texas
and Kansas, being the. more select of the
"bush", v species. ' ; Jones, Â¦ -Me Donald -the
Californian and Bishop ar? about the best
of the riders, while the others could earn
more money In the popcorn business. . :
B. Van Bokkeleri, the San Joso driver,
succeeded in annexing two harness events
with Connie, a Kansas product. He left
for the Terre Haute meet on Monday.
The entries at that racing point are said
to be light this year, an unusual occur
rence. Â¦ ' . â¢â¢'â¢ â¢ Â¦ Â¦ . ' :.-: â¢;.;â¢â¢'â¢-.Â¦ Â¦ Â¦
Â¦ Ed Gaylord, a Denver turfman, pos
sesses the best stable of harness horse.*
here. In hisstring are Yarrum. consider
ed a bright prospect, and Palsy Deane. a
mare "well entered down the line in th<t
slow classes. The same owner's black
pacer Raymond W. 2:0S>4, is going great
guns this year, and is more than HkeJy
to cut his mark to 2:05 or better.
Billy Randall is prominent with Gaunt
let, Panamint, Midlove and Montanus.
The latter horse was taken sick on the
way over from Oakland, and has not been
a starter. Gauntlet ia looked upon as a
stake horse in this section of the country,
and it is difficult to get a race to fill when
he is entered. Mtdlove has thrice shown
her heels to all the "Oregon short liners,"
and she has now been added to the unde
sirable class by the natives. Panamint
has been unlucky in his races, once being
beaten by Miss Redwood, a Colorado mare,
and again a bad start contributed to his
downfall, getting up in time to finish sec
ond to Ben Beach* a Texas three-year
old.
Bozeman and Maynard, well known on
California tracks, have riot been seen to
any advantage in the saddle. The last
named rider is well known to followers of
the ring as a clever bantam-weight. He
donned the mltta here In a preliminary to
the Jackson-Parker go, scoring quite a
hit through his cleverness.
A mild form of Influenza has been prev
alent at Overland Park, and necessitated
the temporary retirement of quite a num
ber of racers from both the running and
harness divisions. Sam Morton and Lew
McArthur. comprising the firm of Mor
ton. & McArthur, were unfortunate
enougrh to have the very useful two-year
old Game "Warden taken do~wn with the
disease. He scampered away from bis
field on the opening day, but is now
phelved. Corolla and Regelong, owned by
the same firm, have more than earned
their board and carfare. Regelong was
to-day sold to a Missouri horseman. â¢ : Â¦ ' - ;
Frank McMahon, well known as the ex
owner of Pat Morrissey, has not met with
much success. Alarla earned brackets on
one occasion, but . Croker has been a
tardy arrival In all ol hi3 essays at the
barrier. Â¦.".Â¦â¢Â¦' â¢ Â¦Â¦'Â¦'Â¦Â¦â¢Â¦.
The starting has been performed by U.
P. UpdegrrafC of . Topeka. Kans. "Whllo

and pacers, his work . wtthv.the runners

Lauphlin scored. Eagan hit to Francks,
but was thrown out, advancing Devereaux
to third and the "old man" scored on
Hughes' hit. Hanlon hit safe, advancing.
Hughes to third. Shanahan struck out,

Curtis &. Sons' Luxor beat Bill Fister
pointless in the first round, and, with Palo
Alto, is looked upon as the good thing in
to-day's finals. Both dogs were quoted at
2 to 1 for stake honors, but Geary's speedy
one receded in the betting to 3 to 1 owing
to a long bye with Narcissus, who was
substituted for St. Michael. Despite this
handicap Palo Alto has a strong backing.
Captain Cane's Greenhall is figured by the
wise ones to be in a good position to take
first money. Greenhall has landed 128-dog
stakes on two occasions, and it looks easy
for him to get, well down-on the card.
Rose of Arden, the captain's recent addi
tion to his kennel of faset ones, has made
a good impression on the dog men. On her
first time out she certainly showed plenty
of speed, and predictions of a great future
were freely made for the recent importa
tion of England's noted stock.
The best short ends were: Hot Haste

The day's results, with Judge John
Grace's official scores, are appended;-
Warship put up a good course, about the
best of the day. He led the fast Rienzl
five lengths and won out with a score of
S to 5. The talent fancy his chances as the

with its nervous. Jerky stroke,: was begin

When the mile mark was reached Wis
consin and Pennsylvania were neck and
neck, with Cornell about a half length be
hind. Between the one and the one and a
half mile Cornell answered the spurt and
came up with the leaders. The noses of
the three shells crossed the one arid. a half
mile absolutely even.. â¢ Wisconsin, how
ever, pulled out just .after that point and
shoved her cockswain up even with: the
other two crews' stroke oars- and then'
they began seasawlng for first place.
Just as they approached the mile mark
Pennsylvania suddenly spurted. Wiscon
sin answered the spurt and in fighting
each other both passed Cornell.
Before the first four crews had gone ten
lengths Cornell had pulled her shell's,
nose out of the bunch. At the third of a
mile mark Cornell had an advantage of
about a third of a length over Wisconsin,
which had managed to get its shell just
ahead of the Pennsylvania shell. George
town was hanging on to Pennsylvania In
a desperate manner, but It was perfectly
evident that she could not last.
In the varsity race Cornell and Pennsyl
vania caught the water first and got off
together, with Georgetown <ind AVisconsln
following them closely, while Columbia
from the first stroke dropped to the rear,
never changing her position during the
entire race.
Thrilling Test of Endurance.
Slowly the Quakers continued to force
their boat to the front and it required an
appeal to the judges to learn that, the
Pennsylvania boys had snatched the
honor of belnj? second to the magnificent
eight from the West by a scant fifth of
a lenprth.
There was some delay in getting the
freshmen off. The race was started a
minute and a half after the hour. The
Wisconsin youngsters Jumped Into the
lead at the crack of the pisfcol and -were
never headed. They had a spring}' move
ment to their bodies which made their
rowing look confident and easy, and they
worked their sweeps as though they were
out for a pleasure spin. But Cornell and
Pennsylvania furnished plenty of snlco to
season with excitement the admiration
raised by the .Wisconsin boys. ' '
As they passed under the bridge, half
way down the course, Cornell was follow
ing the leaders very closely, when sud
denly some one shouted a warning and
the Ithican coach became aware that
Pennsylvania was . spurting and that his
position was in danger. The Cornell men
responded with a will and there began a
spin through the last half mile that
brought the tired crowd to their feet. As
they dug down the stretch there were
crie's on every side Of "It's Cornell !" "It's
Pennsylvania"' and nobody knew who It
was.
Wisconsin Wins All the Way.
The races set to take place between 4
and 6 o'clock had to be postponed because
of wind. Pennsylvania and Wisconsin
during the whole four miles throughout
the varsity race kept the shells lapped,
and at no time was there clear water be
tween them. The same was true of the
Cornell. Columbia and. Georgetown
crews. The fight between Pennsylvania
and Wisconsin became so exciting from
the continued uncertainty that the
crowds aboard the observation train
fairly lost themselves as the boats swept
down into the stretch, and forgetting
entirely their partisanship, they arose to
their fept and, with hats, llags-uncl hand
kerchiefs waving wildly about their
heads, screamed themselves hoarse In
their admiration of the contest.
Cornell, at the head of the trio that
followed the two leaders, worked so hard
that as they flew into the last quarter
of a mile her shell began to lose speed
and It was seen that two of her meit had
collapsed. She took her third place by
heroic work.
As the Pennsylvania and W Isconsin
shells cut the tini?h line and began to lose
momentum the exhausted oarsmen, re
laxing themselves from their terrible
work. shouted a pretty exchange
of congratulations, while those aboard
that part of the observation train opposite
them raised their voices in a hoaree shout
of approval. *J ' . :

One of the most magnificent races in the
history of college aquatics; for years
was the varsity race rowed on the Hud

THE:uS^;^RANCISCO: ;^
. The West End Congregational Church
of this city was the scene of a very pretty
wedding Sunday evening. June 17. when
Miss Josephine Ensipn, daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. C. A. Ensign of this city, and
Louis Reynolds, now of San Francisco,
were united In marriage. The groom 1*
the son of Mr. and Mrs. Embree Reynolds
cf Los Angeles and until recently has
been a resident of this place. He lately
accepted the position of chief electrician
of the Spreckels Independent Power and
Light Company of San Francisco and it
is in that city that he and his bride will
reside. Both young people are very pop
ular throughout the State, both having
been students of the State University at
Berkeley and Mr. Reynolds is a gradual.?
of that university. The church, in which
both bride and groom have been earnest
and popular workers, was handsomely
decorated In honor of the wedding. Stacks
of papyrus and . ribbon grass were ar
ranged around the sides of the auditori
um. Ropes of. Ivy reached from pillar to
pillar and from them were suspended
wedding bells of white and green. In
front of the altar, fastened to an invisible
wlrjB, were, heavy ropes of smilax. and be
tween them; just above where the bride
and groom stood during: the ceremony,

WHEATâ The French markets were firm and
the English weak, with buyers Indifferent.
Chicago, which closed Friday at 81%c, opened
at SIVic, and closed at 80c. There were more
buyers than sellers at the decline, but the mar
ket was nervous and unsettled, support was
lacking, and finally buyers withdrew altogether,
though there was nothing In the crop news to
explain the weakness. Spring reports were still
worse, a special to the Chicago Herald from
St Paul placing the total of the three dry
States at 35,000,000 b"-'"^'' A rather bullish
feature was the strength in cash Corn.
Spot prices showed no material change, but
futures were lower.
The Liverpool Corn Trade News gives the fol
lowing list of â¢stlmated deficiencies in Euro
pean crops: France 80.COO.000 bushels, Ger
many and the United Kingdom 16.000.COO to 24,
000,000 bushels between them. The Russian offi
1 cial returns next autumn will almost certainly
' fall short of last season's extraordinarily large
! estimate by at least 40,000.000 bushels.

CHICAGO,' June 30.â Wheat was only mod
erately active and weak most of the session,
although at the bottom the market tteadled.
It did not. however, show much recuperative
power. At the opening the market wag easy
because Liverpool showed no response to the
advance here yesterday and also because rains
were predicted for the Northwest. This caused
renewed liquidation through commission'
houses on a moderate scale, and as the demand
was rather elack the market slumped. The
European crop conditions were reported favor
able. Through an error Beerbohm's report was
made to show a shortage in this year's world
crop of only 15.000,000 bushels, but a correction
received later makes this 128,000.000. This was
of Influence In the recovery, such as It was
which made the close a bit better than the
bottom. August closed l',4<gl?Â»o.down at SlHc
Corn was quiet and although easy % early' in
sympathy with wheat and under the Influence
of rains In parts of Kansas and fair country
offerings recovered later on a good shipping
demand and closed steady, with a loss of *ic
from yesterday for August.
Oats were rather weak. August closed Â«tc
under yesterday.
Provisions were quiet and weak. The wh<Â»at
decline was of influence, but selling by pack
ers, who kept their reasons to themselves, was
the main factor. The close was weak, 12Uc to
25c down.
September pork left off with a loss of 23c
under yesterday, lard 12Uc down and ribs 13Â®
17Mtc depressed.

wind*. ALEXANDER G. McAPIE.
' Forecast Official.
! Movements were on an insIgniAf-ant scale and
; the market was abiost stagnant during the fore
i part of the Fusion. The dropping tendency in
j the wheat 'and cottcn markets had the effect
!. of Kiffeaiag quotations for some of the rall
â¢ road stocks, which opened depressed en the
soor^ ".of f>i*oli3.t">lc cro j> djimnpc l'rio^s lift'!
dropped back somewhat, when the appearance
of the bank Vtat-Â»ment caused some covering
bv room Fhorts. The movement was, hotfever,
so :f*eble. that there were some recessions, mak
ing the rlr>s<Â» irregular and very dull. The loan
item nt the banl^ftat'ment confirmed the fore
cast of thrpe dih|Â»atches that the liquidation of
sterling loans was probably keeping pare with
the demand fcr new loans to provide fr>r thÂ°
Julv l?t Bettlencnta. This Is the oniv possible
explanation of the decrease in the loan account
of 51..V7.3fÂ». The increase in cash of $649,200
als> fuifiils the expectation that some of the
week's nrquirements for cash had already lx>en
anticirate-1 in latt week's bank statement.
With the ferr.i-ar.nual Settlement period thus
comfortably tided over, the conclusion is rea
sonable that the disbursement* of July 1 of
the large dividend and interest rajTnents will
injure an adequate supply of loanable funds to
meet the .i-oming dt-mands for the crop move
ment. The bond markft has furnished a bet
ter in-^t-x than the stock market of the coming
ease in money and continued linn to-day, as it
hus been all week.
Prices of stocks are generally higher after a
week of great Irregularity and varying fluc
tuation?. The buying has come to a large ex
tent from the thort interest and there has been
no. evidence of a substantial Investment buying.
Bonds have liÂ«*-n firmly held and have ad
vanced on a small volume of business. Untted

Chairman Mark Seeks to Allay I>is
quietude Resulting From Chance'
> --.Remark at Conference of Su
Â¦Â¦Â¦.â¢ y-. pervisors and Directors. -
The very brief discussion on the election
of > teachers for a limited period at the con
ference between the School Directors and
the Supervisors' Committee on Education
last Friday afternoon has caused consid
erable uneasiness among the local peda
gogues. They are under the impression
that the ultimate result of the informal
talk will be to defeat the court decision
which holds that teachers are elected for
life. To correct that impression and to
relieve In a measure the disquietude that
the chance remark of Supervisor Branden
stein may have caused. Chairman Mark
issued a statement yesterday to the effect
that ho is personally in favor of life ten
ure of teachers, with certain limitations
that do not, however, affect the general
result. Directing his remarks to Branden
stein's advocacy of the election of teach
ers for a limited period Mr. Mark says:
"I am a strong believer in | life tenure
of office among teachers under certain
conditions to insure competent instructors
In the department. The first is that merit
alono should be considered in the original
appointment. This Is fair alike to the
pupils and the teachers, as they would be
in a position to give proper instruction
and would also stand a good chance of
continuing their service in the department.
Again, I think that a reasonable term of
probation should be a factor. From one
to three-years to my mind should be the
term during . which. a teacher could prove
his adaptability for the position. The
board has already adopted the probation
ary period of â¢ three years, â¢ and - that ia
probably a Judicious move. Supervisor
d'Ancona's statement that outside of San
Francisco teachers are* elected for one
year j only is not correct. In New York
City teachers are elected for life, though
I -believe the- probationary period extends
for s five years. ;In other Eastern cities
similar conditions prevail, so we are not
the only State that has a statute protect
ing teachers In their positions for life.

It ran across the Market-street cable
track Just as a Haight-street car reached
the crossing. In a Becond the horse was
thrown to the pavement and rolled over
by the cable car. It was so badly injured
by" the shock that it died a litle later.
Both cars were somewhat damaged, near
jy all of the windows being broken.
Superintendent Webster states â¢ that no
matter what legislation might be passed
by the Board of Education regarding tha
appointment of teachers. It could not be
retroactive and affect those already In thÂ»
department. They are protected In their
positions under two sections of the Politi
cal Code and may not be removed except
for sustained charges of immorality, un
professional conduct or evident unfltness
for teaching. Â¦ , ' ' " . ,

can assure them that the board does not

\hem. The State and city should step in
and provide sufficient funds to carry out
the very worthy idea of pensioning such
teachers. More power should be given to
school Authorities, such as Boards of Ed

pare easier methods of retiring teachers.

It relieves the teacher to a gTeat extent
from that constant worry resulting from
doubts entertained concerning reappoint

Army and Navy Parlor "Chutes" En

The Chutes were In the possession of
Army and Navy Parlor No. 207 of the Na
tive Sons last night. The gate receipts are
to go toward the fund the natives are
fetting to-gether to render the big 9th of
_eptember celebration a grand success.
About 300 members of the Natives were
on hand, of which at least 150 were retired
volunteers of the Spanish-American war,
of which the parlor is composed. The vis
itors "took in" every attraction the Chutes
provided and had a general good time.
The affair was under the direction of the
1901 committee, which is composed of the
following named Native Sons: Frank
Grady (chairman). Richard Cline, J. \V.
Ledden, Clarence Son, C. R. Detrick, Ed
Crowley and Thomas Kerrigan.
On the evening of Wednesday, August 8,
the Army and Navy Parlor is to give a
grand minstrel entertainment and dance
at Native Sons' Hall, the proceeds of this
also to be devoted to the 9th of September

â¢ T. K. Hearty, chairman of the regatta

I that a rowing and sailing regatta be held
on Sunday, the 9th of September, and that

allowed for the purchase of trophies to be
awarded to the six different classes of
yachts competing.
Commodore W. N. McCarthy, speaking
for the San Francisco Yacht Club, said
that the members were willing to aid the
celebration in any manner within their
power. He thought that yacht owners
might object to taking part in the naval
parade for fear of fire from lanterns
strung from mast to mast or from fire
works touching the sails. He stated that
the yachting clubs would compete for the
Macdonough cup if the regatta is held on
the 10th of September, or if the regatta
committee desired ti.e yachts could form

If there are to be no military camps this
year it Is probable that a number of the
companies of the National Guard outside
of this city and those in the near-by cities
will come here to join In the parade. It
is expected that several companies of the
