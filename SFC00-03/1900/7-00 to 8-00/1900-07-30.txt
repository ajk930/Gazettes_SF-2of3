MONZA, Italy, July 30. â King Humbert has been assassinated. He was shot here last evening by a man named Angelo Bressi and died in
a few minutes.
The King had been attending a distribution of prizes in connection with a gymnastic competition. He had just entered his carriage
with his aid-de-camp, amid the cheers of the crowd, when he was struck by three bullets fired from a revolver in quick succession. One
pierced the heart of his Majesty, who fell back and expired in a few minutes. The murder took place shortly after 10 o'clock.
The assassin was immediately arrested and was with some difficulty saved from the fury of the populace. He gave his name as

Early in 1S53. when Humbert was but 11
years old, he and his brothers and sisters
were deprived of their mother's guiding
hand. Queen Adelaide was carried off by
an early death.
Youthful Ambitions.
While Humbert and his brother Amedeo
prosecuted their literary and scientific

The moment came in 1S66, Â¦when, on one
try's cause. They had early been inspired
by .their father with enthusiasm for
Italy's liberation, and as lads he had ini
tiated them* into military and political
life. I
In 1E39. while still but a boy, Humbert
was beside his father on those battlefields
which decided the future of Italy. He
was also sent later on political missions
of the greatest consequence. It was he
who took part in the reorganization of
the two Sicilies, and July, 1S62, ' saw him

. Shortly before the outbreak of the war
with. Austria the Prince of Piedmont went
to Paris to sound the Government as to
it? sentiments concerning the alliance
then actually concluded between Italy and
Prussia. Action soon followed upon nego
tiations.
A FEW* days after ascending the
throne, on January 10, 1878, King
Humbert issued a proclamation to
his new subjects, in which he told
them he should be mindful of the
grand example his father had set him of
devotion to Italy, love of progress and
faith in liberal institutions. "My sole am
bition." he concluded, "will be to deserve
the love of my people."
_ And Humbert, dead, will be mourned
sincerely by, the nation that Â¦witnessed the
carrying out of his pledges.
Humbert I, King of Italy, was born at
Turin March 14. 1S44. on the anniversary
of the day that had given birth to his
father, Victor Emmanuel. His mother was
Maria Adelaide, daughter of Archduke
Ranieri, then Viceroy of Lombardy and
Venice. Thus in the veins .of Italy's
King runs some of the hated Austrian
bloodâ the blood of that cruel oppressor
of Italian soil of whom, happily, all ves
tige has vanished from the fair peninsula.
The Princess was a very sweet woman
at his back in the Parliament about 400
of Its members.
"The anarchists of Italy are a peculiar
sect. They are far fewer in number than
in France or England, yet their daring
amounts to fanaticism, and when they
have marked a man for death it behoves
him to watch . artfully, for they exercise
great ingenuity to execute their designs.
"King Humbert was fearless. Although
his life had been twice attempted he took
no particular precautions. He has paid
the rrice. .
â¢The youngÂ»Prlnce is a negative sort of
a man. He is about 30 years old, and
neither very* bad or very pood. Colorless,
I should call him. Still, this outrage will
so shock the people of Italy that it is
certain they will declare for him en
masse."
QUEEN MARGHERITA.
The Princess Margherita. Marie Therese Jeanne of Savoy, daughter of the
late Duke Ferdinand of Genoa, brother of King Victor Emmanuel II, was
married April ~, ISd, at Turin to the Prince, who became King of Italy
upon the death of his father. She was then one of the most beautiful women
in Europe. The Prince of Naples was the sole issue of the marriagre.
VICTOR EmMANUEL III.
The assassination of Klne Humbert clears the way to the throne for
Victor Emmanuel Ferdinand Marie Januarius, Prince of Xaples and Duke
of Savoy, the namesake of his grandfather. Victor Emmanuel II. This
Prince was born at Naples, November 11, 1S69. and Vas married at Rome,
October 24, 1S9G, to Princess Helene 'of Montenegro. There Is no Issue of thiÂ»

ASSASSINATION OF BARON VON KETTELER.
From Le Journal Illustre, Paris.
Attacked by amob of Chinese on June 17, while on his return from a visit to the Tsung 11 Yamen (Chinese For
eign Office), the Kaiser's representative was dragged from his horse and beaten and hacked to pieces. *
Though there are many reasons for be
lieving that the Chinese Government Is
not acting in good faith, the United States
will officially accept all its protestations
of friendship that come through Minister
Wu until it Is known to a certainty that
they are false. President McKlnley*s re
ply to the appeal for mediation and the
use of the good offices of the United
States to secure peace has not yet re
sulted in disclosing the real attitude of
the Imperial Government, as it was hoped
would be the result. Minister Wu did not
officially express his opinion to the State
Department that his Governmetn would
accede to the conditions imposed in the
President's letter, but he let It be known
that he was confident that this would be
the result. Ills confidence has since been
somewhat shaken. Communication with
the Ministers la still the first condition In
sisted upon by the United States as pre
liminary to any negotiations with tha
Chinese Government.
Whatever may be the attitude of the
imperial Government, which even Min
ister Wu admits, he dqes not understand,
the State Department Is satisfied that
many of the most powerful men In China
are opposed 'to the hopeful feature of the
situation, and it la believed that if the
international forces succeed In defeating:
in a decisive manner the Chinese forces
between Tientsin and Peking strong, pres
sure will be exerted upon the imperiat
Government to secure peace on a basis
that will guarantee the safety of foreign
ers and their interests in China In the fu
ture.
CALL BUREAU. WELLINGTON HO
TEL. WASHINGTON, July 29.â"Ac
tion â and immediate action," saJd
Secretary Hay to me this evening,
"Is the policy which the United States is
urging in China. "We are not waiting for
more information, but are proceeding as
If we knew all."
Lacking sufficient forces in China to
make an advance on Peking Independent
ly of the other powers, this Government
can urge the American commanders in
China to exert their influence to the ut
most against delay. This is being done,
and it is believed that more energetic ac
tion may follow* the arrival of Major Gen
eral Chaffee at Tientsin.
The authorities here attach much im
portance to the report of the Chinese stu
dent who was sent frqm Tientsin to Pe
king by Missionary "Wilder and who
brought back word that he saw no Chi
nese troops for sixty miles south of Pe
king, but found 20.000 in the vicinity of
Yangtse-San and Pietsang. If this report
is correct the international troops are con
fronted In the immediate neighborhood of
Tientsin with the only formidable resist
ance they will encounter until they reach
the neighborhood of the capital, which
this student reported to be surrounded
with imperial troops. It is thought here
that this force of 20.000 could easily be
overcome by the international forces, and
that their, defeat, followed by a steady
advance on Peking, would produce a
moral effect that would greatly weaken
the resistance at the gates of the capital.

tle to be got by foraging and there i3
practically nothing to plunder and an
array would have to take supplies of
every kind, including fuel and water. The
question of supplies is in fact the prin
cipal one.
"Further than that it is difficult to say
much, and t do not wish to be placed in
the position of judging the situation be
fore I am thoroughly familiar with It.
TherÂ© arÂ» no mountains or other natural
obstacles. There are no strong fortinca
tions. It Is easy, of course, to throw up
intrenchments. The Chinese will ha.ve the
same difficulties to contend with as far
as supplies are concerned as the allies
must encounter. It will be impossible to
maintain great hordes of men without
something on which they may feed.
"In these military operations the great
base will be the sea. Supplies can bs
brought up the Peiho River and its
branches to within twelve miles of Pe
king, and then there is the railroad. Even
if it is torn up soon it will not be so dif
ficult to get it into operation.
"The Chinese have only a vague notion
of "Western tactics. They have had Ger
man drill masters, but, generally, they
nave been drilling only when they felt
like it. They are good lighters when they
are winning, and they take killing well.
They do not fight well when they begin
to lose and are easily stampeded."
MRS. WOODWARD READY
TO END HER LIFE
CHICAGO, July 29.â Mrs. M. D. -Wood
ward of Evanston, when she wrote ths
last letter received by her husband from
Peking, was armed with a five-shot re
volver. It was her Intention, according
to the letter, to use the first three cart
ridges on the assalllne Chinese. Then,
if -with what the other defenders were do
ing the Boxers were not repulsed, she had
decided to kill her daughter lone with one
of the remaining bullets and shoot fcerselj
with the last, so they would rot fall alivÂ«
into the hands of the Boxers.
This piece of news was contained In tnÂ»
letter written by ilrs. Woodward on Jusa
11 last after she and her daughter had
made a futile attempt to escape from
Peking. They found when they arrived
at the depot that so much cf the track
had been torn up that it was impossible
for them to depart, so they made their
way with difficulty back to the lega.Â£ion.
Jlr. Woodward has guarded the letter
with extreme care, saying wher. asked for
its use by newspapers that it was P^r^
wr.al In tone. He was out of town to
day, but his housekeeper, Mrs. Martha
Hoaglund. told of the determination of
Mrs. Woodward to use tha revolver oa
her daughter and herself if necessary,
saying that she had herself seen the let
ter. "She further stated." said lira*
Hoaglnnd. "that the marines had been or
dered up by Minister Conger and that
news had been received of the landing oJ
the relief force, thus showing that she still
had hopes that they rnl^ht be saved."

that cr-e of the laet acts of the late Col

HUMBERT THE IDOL OF ITALY'S PEOPLE
In 1878 and flgain in 1897
Would - Ee Assassins
Sought His Life
Twice before has the assassin struck
at King Humbert, but on those occasions
he fortunately escaped injury.
The first of these attempts was on No
vember 17, 1V7S. as King Humbert was en
tering the city of Naples. A man who was
among the trade associations, which were
drawn up with their .banners, and who
also carried a flag, suddenly lowered it
and made a thrust at the King, wounding
him slightly in the arm with a dagger
with which he had armed the head of the
staff. The King instantly drew his sword
ar.d struck the assassin on the head and
Signor Calroli, who .accompanied the
King, sprang to the ground and caught
the man. receiving at the same time a
wound In the thigh. The assassin was
then secured. His name was Giovanni
Passar.ante. a cook. v / ; '
This attempted assassination was fol
lowed during the next day by the throw-
Ing of Orsinl bombs among the crowds in
Florence and Pisa on the occasion of
loyal demonstrations in those cities. Nu
merous arrests were made and, as many
of the persons were found to belong to
the International Society, all the Bar
santi clubs in Italy, about thirty in num
ber, were closed-
It was on Thursday, the 22d of April.
1SS7. that the second attempt was made
on the King's life. On that day he was
driving to the Campanelll racetrack, when
a man rushed forward, crying out that he
wanted to present a petition to the King.
He waa permitted to approach the car
riage. Suddenly the man leaped upon the
caJTt&S* etep and * made a viciens Â¦ lunge ,
remove the objectionable lenses. She re
plied she could not see well without them,
and she wished to read. He argued that
some one might read aloud for her benefit,
but she preferred reading fcr herself. The
King bore the infliction in silence a few
minutes and then exclaimed: "It's .of no
use to try; I cannot endure it. Margherila.
if you don't take off those glasses l 11
sing? " This threat acted like magic, and
the offending innocents were quickly re
moved.
It Is hinted that the long walks indulged
in by the Queen are taken mainly that she
may help to ward off the tendency to
overmuch avordupois, to which her sen
sitive spouse objected. She did repine at
his white hair, but he steadily refused to
resort to artince to restore his locks to
their former color.
The King's Joke.
One day he found upon his toilet' table
a bottle of hair restorative, with all the
necessary paraphernalia and explicit in
structions for its use. He took the deli
cate hint, but smiled wickedly to himself.
The Queen is fond of petsâ a snow-whito
poodle dog and a parrot of the same color
being her prime favorites. She waa
greatly shocked one day when a little
bright green dog came bounding Into her
lap, and demanded cf every one what had
happened to her snowy pet. The King
innocently remarked that he found the
restorer on his table, and knowing her
objections to white hair, he thought he
would try it on the dog first, and if Bhe
was not satisfied he would try his luck
with the parrot-
OTHER ATTEMPTS
TO SLAY THE KING
Emmanuel's life hung on a thread, there
was born to them their heir and only
child, also named Victor Emmanuel, after
his grandfather, to whom was accorded
the title of Prince of Naples because of
the F^ce of his birth.
When Rome became Italian the Prince
and Princess of Piedmont also moved
thither to live in the Quirina!, and It was
then that the young Princess gradually
so conquered her father-in-law's good
graces that she acquired great influence
over him. causing him to conform a little
more to than he was wont to do the con
ventionalities and usages of society. It
was a difficult position the Princes? was
called to fill. Countess Miraflore. Victor
Emmanuel's morganatic wife, claimed to
rule the house and desired to take her
place in society as wife. But she was not
of noble birth, ar.d the proud of Roman
nobility would not have sectioned such a
proceeding. Yet it was not until after
Victor KmroanueTs death tha.t Marghe
rita reigned at court with all the honors
due a Queen.
Pays His Father's Debts.
One of Humbert's nrst acts on ascend
ing the throne earned him well-merited
praise. As is well known. Victor Em
manuel was most extravagant, not so
much in- the gratification of his private
tastesâ which were simple, but in chari
ties he knew no bounds. It was found on
his death that his debts were consider
able, and it was proposed in Parliament,
in the first enthusiasm after his lots,
that the State should pay these. To thjs.
however. Humbert opposed a firm nega
tive, declaring that his father's debts
were his. and that he should undertake
ther liquidation. And instantly he s-t
about reducing all needless expenditure
in the various palaces, selling a number
of superfluous horses and restricting out
lays in ever>" mode possible; and this,
helped by an able major-domo, he car
ried through so successfully that not only
did he pay his father's numerous de
pendente, but he had always a good sum
in hand on which he could draw to sub
scribe toward any national charity or
disaster, or to encourage art asd science.
In the course of years, Humbert grew
stouter and stronger, but he aged prema
turely. Fcr some few years past he has
been quite bald. At one time he smoked
to excels, but one day, his doctors having
prescribed abstention from tobacco, he
completely renounced the habit.
Of the beauty of Queen Margherfta all
the world has heard. But she Is now in
clining to stoutness, and the passing
years have taken from hfr that grace and
litheness which marked her movements,
though her sweetness of expression still
remains.
'ond of the Queen.
King Humbert and his Queen were most
congenial friends, and often enjoyed a
joke at each other's expense. When their
son, the Prince of Naples, was In England
he shocked the English proprieties by re
lating the following stories about his
royal parents:
Tha^Queen has a great passion for mu
sic and is a fine performer on the piano,
while the King has neither musical taste
nor ability. Although his perfectly white
hair and mustache showed that he waa
no longer young, he seriously objected
to the marks of time showing on his fair
Queen, and particularly rebelled against
her use of eyeglasses.
One evening as they were cosily seated
"en famille,*" the Queen wishing to read
perhaps the evening paperâ quietly ad
justed her glasses and settled herself for
a good time. The Kin? soon asked, her to

ward Humbert was always in the field
with his troops when occasion required.
ar.d occasion required It right often la
tr.ose stirring times. One of his first acts
â to h's hcrtor be it told â was to declare
that he renounced his stipend as a gen
eral, not desiring, he said, to add a
J-rther burden to the budget cf his heav
ily fc-rdened country-

ar.swÂ«?r given by the Prince, after the
general had pointed cut to him the risk
Le had rcr..
It was not until he was twer.ty-four
years c'd that a bride was chosen for
Humbert. Heirs-apparent are not usual
ly allowed to remain unwedded so long,
but it so happened that death had carried
off the wife destined for pirn, a young
Kapsburg Archduchess. In 1SSS. however.
Victor Emmanuel told his Prime Minister,
Ger.eral Menabrea. that he must f.r.d a
wife for Humbert. To this peremptory
ccrr.rr.and the soldier quietly remarke-i
that she was already found; there was
wrrting only the will of his Majesty and
the cor.srnt cf the Prince. The lady on
whom the general had fixed was the
Princess Margherita. daughter of the
I>-ke cf Genoa, the brave brother of Vic
tor Ernmcnue-l. whom consumption had
early carried away. The Princess ba3
been carefully educated. She was at th^
time a. lovely girl of eighteen, delicate.y

usually ax-companies a bioade complexion,
Â£n<! a snails of bewitching sweetness.
Indeed, Marghcritas smile has become
ZS.TZVJ?. It is alvayi ready in ar.swer to
the loyal ar.d affectionate feelings of her
people, ar.d gots straight to the hearts of
the Italians, to whom the has endeared
bctseU to an extraordinary degree. The
marriage was therefore arranged, and
trtth much pomp it was celebrated at Tu
rin 5n April. l^CS, in the presence of the
royal family.
Net Popular as Prince
At the time cf lii* marriage the Prince
cf Piedmont can scarcely be said to have
been popular. For or.e thing, he was
overshadowed by his father's great popu
larity and that parent's bonhomie and
fenial ways, of which he did not possess
& trace. Moreover, the Prince had earned
for nir^se!f the reputation of a gay char
acter, and though this is by no means
held a reproach in Italy, yet he was criti
cized rather sharply. Consequently he
was on!y popular as his father's son and
a Savoy Prince, and ihat he had proved
himself a true soldier la the campaign of
:SG5.
On the occasion of the Crown Prince's
marriajre Victor Ercniar;uel instituted th*
*rder of the Corona <ritaiia, which Is ac
f rJed for ir.fr! t of whatever kind. After
Vicing a triumphal tour through the
chief. Italian cities, the bride and bride
groom settled down to live <;uietly at Tu
rin. A year and a fcaif later, when Victor
Victor Emmanuel Ferdinand Maria Gen
naro. the Prince of Naples, who succeeds
to the throne of Humbert as Victor
Emmar.uel II, was born November 11, 1SS9,
in Naples. It was just and right, said the
Neapolitans, that the son of a soldier
should be born upon the day dedicated to
the protector of soldiers, Martino of
Tours. The choice of Naples and of the
name Gennaro, patron of that city, was
not accidental. In this also the concep
tion and judgment cf the Unitarian dyn
asty shone with new luster and splendor.
The birth of this grandson of the great
Kir.fr. of the future hereditary Prince of
Italy, with a title no longer Prince of
Piedmont (until this* time borne by his
house), but with that of Prince of Naples,
destroyed with one blow those few illu
sions which might still remain in the
minds of those who were interested in and
desirous of a restoration of the past. It
was a new and strong affirmation of Italy
united.
Â¦ The Prince of Naples Is an active. Btrong
young man, with a hi^h and broad fore
head and a serenely searching gaze. He
resembles his father in the upper part of
his face, while In the lower may be traced
the sweet and pleasant maternal linea
ments in which, however, the Boft fea
tures of the Anglo-Saxon race are tem
pered by the stern and martial energy of
Savoy. His person reflects dignity, se
riousness and earnestness. One sees in
him a great scho'ar inâ the pursuit of
science, of the good and the beautiful:
truly one of these characters, virile and
confident, to which the words may be
applied once Quoted of the adamantine
lama, "fraoxrar nan. fiectar," --
at the King with a dagger which he had
concealed in his handkerchief. The King,
partly rising, turned the blow by striking
the man's wrist with bis elbow and the
dagger struck the cushion of the carriage.
In an instant all was confusion. The
King's escort charged upon the crowd,
which, in the excltment, had closed in
upon the carriage, while others of the
guard seized the would-be assassin. The
King wa? perfectly composed. "These
are our little professional perquisites." he
quietly remarked, and then ordered the
carriage to proceed to the races, which
he witnessed as though nothing unusual
had occurred. The crowds at the races
cheered their plucky King, and his return
to the palace was marked by a tremen
dous ovation. When the King's assailant
was brought to trial it was ascertained
that he was named Pietro Acciarita. aged
24. an anarchistic iron worker of Artegna.
He declared that he had acted alone and
in despair, as men do when they commit
suicide; that if the deed had been pre
meditated he would have thrown a bomb,
and that the object of his attempt upon
the life of the King was to strike the
chief representative of the class living in
comfort. When the prisoner was sen
tenced to the galleys for life on May 29.
1SS7, he shouted for anarchy and the revo
lution, and said that the turn of the bour
geois government would come.
A man named Romeo Frezzi was also
arrested on suspicion of complicity in the
crime, and a week later his family was
informed that he was dead. The police
reported that he had committed suicide,
but an autopsy revealed that he had been
murdered in his cell.

His Honor's Joke.
Sam Bedford relates a good joke that
occurred at Calhoun this week In Judge
Owen's court. A case was on trial, and
thp Judge was being worried by a young
man who kept moving nbout In the rear of
tlio courtroom, lifting chairs and looking
under benches.
"Young man," Judge Owen called, "you
nre making a grent deal of unnecessary
noise. What are you about?"
"Vour Honor." replied the man. "T have
lost my overcoat nnd am trying to find it."
"Well." paid the Judge, "people often
lose whole suits in here without making
all that disturbance." â Owensboro In

WILL CALIFORNIA CAVALRY
BE ORDERED TO CHINA?
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SALINAS. July 20.â Is Troop C of the
State militia to be drilled for active
t-prvice in China is a question which
has obtained much serious consid
eration here to-day. The troop in
full resalla and with complete equipments
for an extended campaign left this city
this afternoon amid the cheers of the
citizens.
The soldiers were told that their march,
which will take ten days, is one merely,
for practice drill, but from assertions
made by those who profess to know it
would seem .otherwise. It is true that the
cavalrymen expected to go into camp with
all tho State militia, but they were dis
appointed. Later they received orders to
nssemfcle and be prepared for a ten days'
outing. The troop for tho past three
years has been unmounted, but last week
many horses were procured for use of the
men, and to-day the full troop was in line,"
while commissary wagons were in readi
ness. Supplies have been arriving for sev-
eral days and the cavalrymen are not only
now fitted out with sabers but with car
bines, too.
Many of the troopers have been in the
volunteer regular service, therefore they
are ready for anything. When it was
hinted to-day that they might be called
out there was a universal satisfaction
among the men. Several United States
army officers were in this city last week
and purchased horses for service to be
shipped to San Francisco.
It ts now asserted that they were here
not only to procure mounts, but to in
vestigate the condition of Troop C. It is
said that several interviews -were had
with Captain Burke and the condition of
his men freely discussed. Tho troop is
camped to-nijrtit about twelve miles from
this city on the road to Hollister and will
do route march duty in a rough country
The men expect to go toHollIster. GH

Sequoia's Anniversary.
Sequoia Parlor, N. S. G. W., will cele
brate Its tenth anniversary by a banquet
Tuesday evening. Nearly every member
has signified his intention of beln? present
and from the programme prepared an.l
the enthusiasm displayed by both tne
original charter members and those who
have Joined later It will be an event long
to be remembered by those participating.
Sequoia Parlor had its birth during thÂ«
days preceding the great celebration of
1S00. The committee having charge of tne
arrangements is composed of Dr. E. V.
Donnelly, chairman; O. W. Yost. L. C.
Plstolesi. James li. Tyson. I? T. Sens-,

Florence Roberts, supported by White
WhiUlesey. will appear this week In "Ro
meo and Juliet" at the Alcazar Theater.
The management promises something ex
ceptional in the stage setting through
tlveir poetic press agent â a "grotesque
mounting and artistic dressing"â which
sounds attractive.
"The Great Ruby" will be performed for
the last time this evening. The entire
auditorium has been taken by the Wood
men of the World who will enjoy a mo
nopoly of the thrilling melodrama.
"The Red Lamp," a Beerbohm Tree suc
cess, will be presented to-morrow even-
Ing for the first time in this chy. with
Wilton Lackaye in the role of Demetrius,
chief of the Russian detective staff.' Keith
Wakeman will appear as the Princess
Claudia.
"Aida" alternates with "Lucia" this
week, and the cast for "Lucia" Is as fol
lows: Lucia. SIgnora Repetto; Edgar,
Slgnor Russo: Ashton, Slgnor Ferrari;
Raymond. Slgnor NicoIinJ. The chorus
and orchestra will be enlarged for the
grand opera season. â '--
It is strongly desired by the manage
ment that patrons shall be seated each
evening by S o'clock in justice to the sing
ers, as the performance will begin prompt
ly at that hour.
To-night's cast for "Alda" includes
Anna Lichter as Aida: Amneris, Frances
Graham; Kadames, Signer Avedano;
Amonraso, Signer Salassa; Ramphis. Sig
nor Nicollni; King, William Schuster.
With this evening's performance of
"Alda" at the Tivoli Opera-house begins
the annual season of grand opera. It was
generally admitted that the Tivoli's last
eeason of grand opera was the best ever
attempted at the popular little theater,
but, with the names found on this years
list of artists, every previous effort will
certainly be outdone.
Mr. Miller also announces the third
Burton Holmes lecture on Thursday aft
ernoon next at the Columbia Theater,
with subject "Round About Paris."
"His Excellency the Governor" Mr. Miller
was resting, and It is cordially hoped that
his voice and throat recovered their usual
tone during the needed rest.
The favorite "Heartsease" will be next
week's bill.
Henry Miller will appear this week In
"Brother Officers," the comedy drama by
Lee Trevor, which was presented here
with such success last season. During
Mr. and Mrs. John Mason gave a gra
cious and refined rendering of a pretty
comedy, "A Loving Legacy." The Nich

sketches, and the St. Onge brothers did
wonders on the wheel. The American bio
graph ends an attractive bill
"lightning changes" are made with un
paralleled alacrity from morning dress to
a yachtsman's afternoon neglige, and from
that to what the lady novelists call'fault
less evening dress. Her voice is good, her
songs clever, her wardrobe apparently by
Poole and her walk and "business" manly
to a turn.
The Orpheum has another excellent
menu this week. Zelma Rawlston. tlie
male Impersonator, made a great hit. Her
Dunne and Ryley's. . Her singing gave
much pleasure, and when she learns to
breathe, a future with a big "F" may be
prophesied for her.
Fischer's, is a new engagement with tht
better voice and style than we have yet
heard from her, the "Japanese Baby."
Isabel Underwood, the recent favorite at
Orpheum. in the line of male impersona
tion, so different are they, and both so
good. Norma Whalley looked even more
fetching than usual in Paris gowns, and
one from Worth of Japan, and sang in
Â¦âHE Dunne and Ryley company at
Ox the California Theater have revived
this week the amusing vaudeville
operetta '"By the Sad Sea Waves. '
It is, of course, plotless and of
kaleidoscopic architecture, but the songs
are bright, the specialties amusing, and
the fun clean and wholesome.
Mary' Marble, as Sis Hopkins, is a Joy
forever. Her song, the "Hoo-do-doo-do
Man." was given with no less than an
exquisite intuition of the composer's in
tention in the charmins little sketch. The
bathing duet with Mr. Matthews was
prettily given, and â it was certainly Mias
Mary's turn last eveningâ the "Yankee
Reuben Glue" song gave much pleasure.
It is interesting, by the way. to compare
the work of this'clever actress with that
of Miss Zelma Rawlaton. now at the

are of such a character that they are in

The car was provided -with the usual

opinion that during yesterday's storm
lightning struck the short circuit and cut
it out. This left but one circuit unpro

The Dawson miners brought news that the Lightning, the steamer on which they came up the Yukon, passed the
wreck on the river steamer Florence S.. which was upside down and fast breaking up. Purser Maltby and Mrs. Stewart
and her daughter, passengers on the steamer, had been drowned. Much gold was lost.
An Investigation made into the smallpox epidemic at Dawson has revealed the fact that the disease was taken to
Dawson by a miner who went up from White Horse on a scow. When he arrived at Dawson he was taken to the
Good Samaritan Hospital, but the fact was not then known that he, had the smallpox and he was placed in a ward
with others. Soon after three other men were ill with the disease. They have all been put on a floating pesthouse and
a strict quarantine la being enforced.
A fourth body has been found In the Yukon near Selkirk, bearing bullet wounds, as did the other three victim? of
last winter's trail" murders. The remains, it is believed, are those of Graves, the partner of the accused murderer,
George O'Brien, now awaiting trial at Dawson." â¢

There is much complaint at Skaguay owing to the fact that the Canadians are refusing to bond American liquor
through their territory. A Skaguay business man said at a Board of Trade meeting there: "Why does the United
States grant the Canadians prlville.es that injure American trade and that Canada refuses to our merchants? Is it be
cause we fear them? Or do we owe them any such advantage? Did the Skaguay pioneers make sufficient money
during the few months that the Americans had full swing in the interior to last them a lifetime? If something is not
done to repair or regain that which our Government- has surrendered, Skaguay will cease to be as Important as a
watering tank erected on a desert for the benefit of an engine."

the situation there. O. 1-- Snaulding, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, is alÂ«o expected at Skaguay.

brought by the steamer Danube, which arrived from Skaguay to-day, and the figures given are those of the

"I see he is sitting in a box." she said
with a gracetul wave of her hand toward
I the place where Jones was sitting. "Ha
smiled at me. but 1 did not respond to his
mirthful RreetinK. I have smiles for
other members of the company."
And to prove her assertion she beamed
and showed her pearly teeth to the scene*
shifter, the fireman and the mock police
man, who were standing near. Despite
i her statement that she did not carÂ©
i whether Joney was elsewhere or not. it
la certain that his presence in the theater
last evening had a distressing effect on
the pretty actress. In the language of tha
profession, she was "rattled." She at
tributed her nervousness to "first night"
I and fatigue from rehearsing all day. but
j it was plainly seen that she would have
been happier had Waiter been in tho
windy city with his promised bride.
Miss Whalley shook her "bang" and
said that she could never be reconciled to
Mr. Jones. She pouted at the mere men
tion of bis name and took a glass of water
as if to remove the bad taste it had left
in her mouth. Her mother, an English
woman of refinement, rejoined her daugh
ter on Saturday night and now Miss
Nnrma has a stern chaperon to keep tha
"Johnnies" from bothering her. Mrs.
, Whalley disclaimed having come from
London to protect her' daughter from
Jones, hut is willing to admit there has
been "Too Much Jones" in connection with
her daughter's name.
"If the newspapers want a sensation.'*
exclaimed Jones. "I will furnish it by
jumping off the Cliff House and fight with
the seals, but for pity's sake don't coupla
my name with Miss Whalley. There was
never anything between us. I have been
engaged to an estimable lady in Chicago,
and these continued stories in the news
papers have created no end of trouble for
me in that quarter. It was absolutely
necessary for me to go to the- windy city
to see my Intended and prove that the
stories were untrue. I returned here at
the request of Mr. Dunne and will fulfill
the contract I made with him. These con
tinued stories have a depressing effect
not only on Miss AVhalley but myself, and
I hope they are discontinued â at least un
til after I am married."
Mr. Jor.es is engaged to a Miss Ptzlaifer
of Chicago, and he carries her picture In '
a golden locket. He is not ready to state
the date of their nuptials, but promises to
do so in proper season.
As for Miss Whalley ar.d himself? "Well.
it is all off between them.
Mr. Jones returned from Chicago yes
terday after an absence of nearly threa
weeks. He came at the request of John

coming was expected by Miss Whalley.
but she cared not. Her engagement with,

Jones wants to play the part of the ica
man *n the new piece, bo that he can de
liver large chunks of frosteu water to tna
lady who "trew him down."
Miss Whalley was besieged with cards
from members of the press, who were
anxious to learn her true feelings toward
her late partner in vaudeville. It did not
take her an instant to let her Interview
era know that Walter was persona, non
grata with her. She said 8he looked upon
him as a bad pennyâ always turning up.
She also said other nice things about
him.
Mr. Jones sat in a box at the opening
performance of "By the Sad Sea Waves"
and smiled sweetly at beautiful Norma,
but alack and alas, she had no smile for
him'. She looked straight over his curly
locks and into vacancy. Had she smiled
there might have been a reconciliation,
and the curtain might have dropped
swiftly on the finish of a pathetic theat
rical drama. Miss Whalley had smiles
for everybody but Walter. For him there
was only a frosty stare, that would hava

heavy woolens.
They do not speak as they pass by. nor
will they address each other when they

sad story, that can only be told to "chills

"I don't care whether Walter Jones ts In

LABORER SUCCUMBS
TO TERRIBLE INJURIES
SAN JOSE, July p.â William H. Kline,
chief deputy to Assessor Dodge of San
Francisco, and Mrs. Vashti Barter of that
city, were married in this city yester
day. The parties came to San Jose by the
afternoon train, a marriage license was
secured and they repaired to the residence
of Rev. J. W. Dinsmore, pastor of the
First Presbyterian Church, where the
ceremony was performed. Mr. Kline is a.
deputy In the office of County Assessor

the last Republican State Convention, and
now a candidate for State Senator, and of
Mrs. James Kirk of Arcata, Humboldt
County.
Mr. and Mrs. Kline left to-day for Santa
Cruz for a short sojourn and expect to
return to San Francisco the latter part
of the week. They will reside at 1006 Van
Ness avenue. Mr. Kline stated last even
ing that it was the desire of both him
self and wife to have a quiet wedding- an.1
advantage was taken of the opportunity
given by a short vacation trip to San
Jose.
Three of the latest British destroyers
are laid up at Portsmouth badly battered.
The engines of the Bat have been under
reconstruction since last February, when
they were disabled during trial; the Hunt
er is scarcely worth repairing and tho
Teazer had six inches ripped off her bow.
The record of the destroyers for acci
dents is far worse than of any other class
of naval vessels and this applies to those
of all navies.
A new classification of Japanese war
vessels has recently been promulgated.
Battleships over 10,000 tons are rated as
first class, and under 10.000 tons as second
class. Cruisers are in three classes, re
gardless of their being armored, protect
ed or unprotected, the first claes taking
in all over 7000 tons; the second class in
cluding thoso between 7000 and 3500 ton*;
all under 3500 tons are third class. Coast
defense ships are rated in the same order
as the cruisers. Gunboats over 1000 tons
and less than 1000 tons are rated first
and second class respectively. Torpedu
boats of 120 tons and v>ver are first class;
above seventy tons, -second class; over
twenty tons are third class, and less than
twenty tons are fourth class. According
to the above classification Japan's navy
consists of the following vessels: Six
first class and two second class battle
ships; six armored fii-st class cruiser \
nine protected cruisers and five of thÂ©
third class. Of coasi-defense vessel3
there are ten, all of the third class. Fif
teen gunboats are rated two and thirteen
in the first and second class. Four dis
patch vessels, one torpedo-depot ship and
twelve destroyers have no classification,
while the nine-three torpedo boats arc
rated in their order of four sizes at seven,
thirty-one, twenty-seven and twenty
eight. This makes a grand total of 163
vessels of all types and sizes.
Two flagrant instances of injustice aio
reported from the British battleship Ceti
turlcti. Some months ago a gunner was
bentenced to ninety days' hard labor for
stealing half a pound of meat, a punish
ment far in excess of the seriousness of
the offense. Quite recently a sergeant of
the marines aboard the Centurion stole
the kit-bag of a private and substituted
his own name for that of the rightful
owner. The only punishment he received
was a private lecture by the chaplain.
Five of the fastest cruisers in the Brit
ish navy have required thirteen days to
make the run from Plymouth to Gibral
tar. As the distance is only about 104'J
knots these twenty-one-knot cruisers
made but a poor show of speed: In Ma> ,
1S0S, the cruiser Terrible made the dis
tance in seventyvtwo hours.
China is not entirely without a navy
and although it has no battleships there
are a number of good cruisers and de
stroyers built since the war with Japan
which are very good vessels. It was only
the northern fleet that was practically
annihilated in 1894. for the southern fleet
took no part whatever In any of the en
gagements. This southern fleet consists
of seven cruisers ranging from 14S0 to
2000 tons, none of tlmm over sixteen years
old, and well armed; three torpedo gun
boats, five flat-bottomed gunboats and
about fifteen other crafts of doubtful
value. The modern fleet numbers two
4300 ton cruisers, built at Elswick, with
a speed of twenty-four knots; three 2160
ton cruisers of over twenty knots speed,
built in Germany; one torpedo gunboat oÂ£
twenty-two knots speed, and some tor
pedo boats somewhat out "of date and
most likely, worthless. Four destroyers
built at Klblng, of thirty-five knots trial
speed, have been detained by the German
Government.
France is gradually getting rid of some
of/its obsolete and old naval vessels. The
Trident, armored ship of SS57 tons, built
in 1S76, Is withdrawn from the active list
to become a stationary hospital ship at
Marseilles. The gunboat Paplu, built in
1SSC. is also stricken from the list, and
the Klore Is to be broken up.
The British battleship Benbow has been
reboilered and somewhat modernized. A
trial under natural draught gave ?&)"
horsepower and a speed of 15.55 knots. In
1888, when her first trial took place, sho
developed 11.500 horsepower and 1S.73
knots speed omder forced dra.ught, aud
her latest performance under natural
draught Is very satisfactory.
It is alleged that Emperor Â¦William in
duced the Sultan of Turkey to give the
work^of reconstruction of a battleship to
Krupp, although the price demanded was
far in excess of the bid submitted by the
Armstrong firm of Elswick.

OGDEN. Utah. July 29.â George H. Burgett, paying teller of the Ogden Bank,
was killed in Pine Canyon this morning by falling from a cliff 1300 feet high.
Burgett left Ogden Saturday in company with Richard P. Hume on a
prospecting tour of the mines at the head of the canyon, in which Burgett was
interested. At Whitohead's mining camp they were joined by three miners in
the employ of Whitehead and the start up the dizzy trail over the range was be
gun to the properties owned by Burgett. When near the top of the trail they
stopped to rest, Burgett sitting on a V-shaped rock. In some manner he
slipped and pitched head foremost, dropping to a flat rock 300 feet below, from
which he bounded 1000 feet to the bottom of the gulch. His companions Â¦went to
where he lay. He was mangled beyond recognition, his head being crushed- to a
jelly, every bone broken and the entrails exposed. The mangled body was carried
back to Whitehead's camp and word sent to friends here.
Burgett was a well-known citizen of Utah. He had resided here twelve
years. His father, mother and sister reside at Aberdeen, S. D.

Fair Crop on Two Thousand Acres of
LODI, July 29.â The FUgar beet harvest
begran yesterday, the first shipment being
made by the Crockett representatives,
Â¦who have about 2000 acres in this section
and New Hope in be*>ts. For a time it
â¢was thought that the crop would not
amount to much, ov.ir.g to heat and lack
of rains, but now it Is estimated that a
fair output can lw? counted on. For three
years the company has tried sugar beets
in th's neighborhood and this is the firs'
successful season it has had. poor as tni:
season may be. Fie-ld Superintendent
Larson cleared the town yesterday of
every man and youth whom he could hire
to go into the beet fields in the New Hop-a
district and harvest th* saccharine vege
table. The frockett Company will plant
a. large acreage in northern Ean Joarjuin
next year.
The first shipment of watermelons for
the season from this p'a^e went out last
night, bound for San Francisco. Melons
are late this year and the crop is small,
none of the fields in the once . famous
watermelon belt turning out anything like
a crop. Of iate yars it has been noticed
that the o!d Ix>dl watermelon, once

JOHN' W. GEARY, in whose memory
Alcalde Parlor of the Native Sons
will have a splendid allegorical float
In the Admission day parade, really
lived but a few years In this city, but dur
ing those few years he exerted a wide In
fluence and won the confidence of the pio
neers.
He came to this coast just after the
close of the Mexican war, in which he had
served with gTeat rallantry as lieutenant
colonel of a Pennsylvania regiment. In
recognition of his services President Polk
appointed him Postmaster of Terba
Bueaa, as San Francisco was then known.
Soon after hie arrival he was elected Al
calde of the town, and was the last to
hold that title in this city. He was sub
sequently promoted to the position of
Judge, and whrn the city of Sun Fran
cisco was Incorporated became Its first
Mayor. When he left here, in 1852, It was
his purpose to return, but the death of
his wife ohanEcd his plans and he settled
in his old home ir. Pennsylvania, He was
an important factor In tlie admission of
the State to thf Union, being one of the
framers of the first constitution.
The subsequent history of General Geary
is familiar to all Californians. He served
as Governor of Kansas, arose to tho rank
of .brigadier general during tbe civil war
through his bravery, served as military
Â¦ governor of Savannah and was twice
; elected Governor of the great State of
, Pennsylvania. He died in 1S73, just after
the expiration of his second term as Gov-
I ernor of Pennsylvania.

SAN ANDREAS, July 29.â Was Joseph
Eayles murdered? That is the question
that is puzzling the people of this section
of the country, and developments tend to
Ftrenpthen the theory of crime.
Three fons of Joseph Bayles. whose
charred remains were found in the burn
ing ruins of his house and tarn at Glen
coe. In tiiis county, have arrived at the
scene of the tragedy and are investigat
ing the matter. It is the general opinion
of the neighboring peojile that a foul
crime ha* been committed, although it Is
almost Impossible to trace the deed now.
Circumstances surrounding the case
tend to strengthen the murder and arson
theory. It is now twliew-d that Bayles
Â¦was shot and killed r.y a bullet from his
own rtSe while he warn moving about his
barn, and the building lired to consume
the body and remove all traces of the
crime.

THE TRAGEDY
AT GLENCOE
Special -.Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER. B. C. July 29.-The 600
members . of the Steveston Fishermen's
Union .are now the only white men not
fishing on the Fraser River. The strike is
broken, with the exception of the mem
bership of this one union, but they are
holding out with the almost impossible
determination that the cannery men
must sooner or later come to their terms.
The strike has lasted now for th rty
days. The Fishermen's Union at West
minster, fifteen miles up the Fraser
River from Steveston, decided this morn
ing that they would go out to-night. News
from Steveston at 6 o'clock to-night says
they were passing out into the gulf at that
hour, and were being jeered by the union
men of Steveston as they passed the
wharves.
The Westminster union numbers 500
men, and its disaffection is a big loss to
the strikers. Nearly all the Indians are
also going out to-night, and, with the
Japanese, who have been out for a week,
there is a fleet of 3000 lishing-boats at the
mouth of the river. Everything was quiet
this afternoon at Steveston.
Last night a shooting scrape, in which
a Siwash was badly wounded by an Ital
ian in a quarrel over a Klootchman,
aroused the town. The sentries of the
militia encampment thought the strikers
were out for business, and in five minutes
the militia force was in battle array. The
300 soldiers successfully surrounded the
Indian and his foreign enemy, and both
of them were locked up in jail.
Yesterday afternoon the latest decision
of the canners was communicated to the
fishermen in the form of a letter. The
document was read, making the offer of
20 cents for the season instead of the 23
cents asked by the fishermen, the can
ners refusing to recognize the union. The
fishermen agreed to take the 20 cents and
wished to settle on that basis, but said
their union must be recognized. They
therefore tore up the letter of the canners
and communicated their decision to the
employers of labor on the Kraser River.
Negotiations were then declared off, and
the canners say they will have nothing
more to do with the men.

I â¢ 1505 Arch st. Phfla.An invention of that kind fills a long felt want. It
is true that almost every man and every woman has
a larynx supplied free by nature, but, like most other
free gifts, the average natural larynx is unsatisfac
tory. It does not emit a good tone unless carefully
cultivated, and even then the tone is limited in range
and variety of expression. Thus when a person has
a good serviceable larynx she becomes a Patti, is
looked upon as a genius, and receives more money
from the people for a half-dozen songs than a good,
hard-working statesman can get for a year's service.
1âNROFESSOR STUART of the University of
L_^/ Sydney is said by reports from Australia to
* have made an artificial larynx for a man who
had lost that portion of his anatomy through disease
and to have inserted it into place with such success
that the possessor is now blessed with a voice that
commands the admiration of the town. It is added
that the new larynx can be. so regulated as to make
the voice soprano, tenor, contralto or bass at will.
HIS Smopth and Serene Highness, the Master Manipulator
" It C wai thus a member of the present Cabinet spoke
of his chief. President William McKinley. He spoke
well. In this one sentence hwArove straight to the secret
of William McKinley' s puccess.
The character of President McKinley is many-sided. It is a
character so blended, to mixed with the guod and bad, the
strong and weak, that even now, after he has been }â¢pW
years in public life and three years and a half in the \v hlte
House, is is but imperfectly understood.
The President's is a character of which it is easy to make
a mistaken estimate. His fond admirers praise him as all that
is wise, calm, noble, far-sighted, unselfish, strong. His enemies
rush to the other extreme and set him down as shallow, selfish,
a man of one Idea, without backbone, a creature of circum
stance; wobbly, ruled by stronger wills than his own; a mere
politician, rattling about in the chair which a statesman should
occupy.
The truth lies somewhere between these two extremes. Be
ing neither foe. nor favorite of the President I shall attempt to
establish this mean of truth and accuracy.
To my mind William McKinley is the most natural and
Cully developed flower of our American modern spirit as repre
sented and interpreted by the Republican party. The American
people are a business people and the Republican party Is the
party of business. Mr. McKinley is the incarnation of all these
things. He is pre-eminently the business man in politics. He
set out upon his public career with a single idea, and that was
business prosperity secured through legislation. He was not a
philosopher. He was not even a student of economics in the
higher sense. He was not afflicted with principles or theories
other thnn the principle that public prosperity is the highest
form of patriotism and that this prosperity may be secured
through the statute books. That was Mr. McKinley's start and
he has never got far away. He has simply developed and ex
tended it. In himself he has found the best representative of
the idea the country ever had.
â¢ Â» â¢ *
There is a marked difference between Mr. McKinley and Mr.
Bryan. The latter knows nothing about business. He cares
little about the prosperity of the mills, the banks, the mer
chants. His stronghold is in the principles, in the axioms laid
down by the fathers. Mr. Bryan deals in maxims, Mr. McKin
ley in men and money The one has the public speech as his
Ideal, the other the tale told by the treasury statistics. Mr.
Bryan believes the highest expression of statesmanship is
found In rhetoric; Mr. McKinley believes It is in the rumble of
wheels and blowing of whistles. Each is almost perfectly rep
resentative of his party and of the elements which range them
selves behind him in this campaign; for Democracy and its al
lies are distinctively the parties of theory, of dissent, of protest,
of denunciation: while the Republicans are the party of con
struction, of executive ability, of responsibility, of action. The
one needs a voice, the other a performer. Each has what It re
quires.
Mr. Bryan is saturated with principles, with theories, with
maxims concerning the government. If he were elected Presi-,
lent it would take him several years to rid himself of them and
;et down to actual business on business lines. Mr. McKinley
(vas never hampered with any such impedimenta. The only prin
ciple he ever had was the simple one born of a nation's imma
ture epoch â it is better to produce at home than to buy abroad,
and the best way to keep the foreigner out is by putting up a
tariff Wall against him. Literally no other theory ever harassed
him. Had he been called to the head of a great railway or in
surance company he would have been quite as successful there
as he has been at the head of the Government, because he would
have made his principles to fit the facts and cases as they
arose. He would have taken good care of the property, seen to
it that there were dividends for the stockholders, manipulated
the board of dlrectois, compromised and arranged all disanTec
tlons within his own concern or ruinous wars with rivals, and
would never for a single instant have forgotten himself, his
power, his security in his office or his salary.
* â¢ ?
It is sometimes said that Mr. McKinley is an opportunist.
He is Opportunism is the essence of American business suc
cess. Given honesty, loyalty, industry, untiring energrjâ the
groundwork common to all industrial or political organizationsâ
and no other principles are needed by the modern school. Every
thing else is improvised as required by the developments of the
day and the emergencies of the hour. Put Mr. Bryan at the
head of a big concern and he would endeavor to run it by means
of preconceived notions. It would be all theory. There would
be hard and fast rules. He would try to operate upon men by
means of principles borrowed from the fathers. Mr. McKinley,
the true executive, counterpart of all modern industrial admin
istration, operates upon men directly through understanding of
human nature.
McKinley's one basic principle led him, immediately after his
inauguration in 1897. to call Conprcss to special session for the
purpose of enacting a new tarilt law. There his instinct and
his luck ran parallel. His idea was to give the country prosper
ity. Now, prosperity was coming of itself; coming slowly but
surely in response to laws infinitely higher and greater thani
acts of Congress. But McKinley got his new tariff law upon!
the statute books just in time to secure credit for all the good
times that followed.
Apart from this one act. all the remainder of McKinley's
administration has been opportunism of the simplest and most
obvious sortâ practical, sensible, business opportunismâ meeting
problems after they have developed and not before, drifting care
fullv with complications till they can be thoroughly understood
taking advantage of events rather than trying to force or
create them. McKinley never set out to be an explorer or dis
coverer. He sails along with the fair wind, but steers conÂ«
stantly and well and has one of the best weather eyes ever seen
upon the political waters. He runs into port with the tide, but
no mariner ever watched light more alertly than he or was more
skillful in avoiding shoal or breaker.
* * *
McKinley's habitual opportunism, his practice of waiting to see ho*
the wind blows, has given the careless observer the Impression that
this is a sign of weakness, of timidity,. of lack of character. It la
nothing of the sort. Opportunism is Mr. McKin'.ey's principle, it is his
strength, it is his salvation. He believes in it. he worships at Its
shrine. He goes upon the theory that the best opportunity is the most
successful in the race. The results indicate that he is right.
What did he do when the people and the Congress were crowding
rapidly toward war with Spain? He was not weak enough to place
himself at the head of the popular impulse, as a demagogue might have
done. He resisted all temptation to make himself the hero of the Jin
goes. Nor did he go to the other extreme and strain himself seriously
in an effort to maintain peace. What he did do was Just what might
have been expected from William JlcKlnley. He tried to compromise
upon a business basis. Compromise and business methods are his chief
characteristics. He wanted to keep the Spanish negotiations concern
ing Cuba wholly in his own hands. He hoped to arrange for Cuba's
perfect autonomy as a palliative, and Incidentally as a great feather in
the cap of William McKinley. If worst came to worst, and war
swooped down upon him. despite all efforts to confine trouble to the
realm of diplomacy, he wanted it to come, not in 1S9S. Just as he
had become well settled In the Presidential chair, but In 1899, or 1900,
upon the eve of the campaign for his re-election. .This may be letting
a secret out of the bag, but it Is a secret well known to many of the
President's official household and to a few Senators.
But for the destruWion of the Maine McKinley would doubtless have
succeeded. He would have been able either to secure by diplomacy
some sort of settlement of the Cuban trouble, or to have held off the
war to suit his own ideas as to the best and proper time for It. r
As It was. the explosion in Havana harbor made war Inevitable.
When it came McKinley plunged himself Into it with all the resources
of his well-trained mind and great executive ability. He made himself
the head and front of It, and tremendously advanced his personal pres
tige through It. The man who was strong enough to wait, to bide his
time, to permit great mdvements to develop to the point of Imperative
ness and clear Intelligibility before taking decided ground, had hia
chance at last and made the most of it.
If we seek a better keynote to the McKinley character than any we
have as yet employed, perhaps we shall find it in saying that he is an
adept in the art of benevolent selfishness. His is the policy and the
practice which endeavors to make everything work out for the common
good and his own special benefit. So great is his skill that even
close observers often lose sight of the man and his personal motive in
the splendor of the well-disposed ensemble. He is even content to play
the game so adroitly that men think him weak and vacillating. There!
Is a prevalent belief that he lacks strength of purpose and is easily
led by others; that he wobbles and yields too much to be entitled to
a niche in'the gallery of real fame.
This Is an error. It is a natural error, due to the cleverness -with
which the game of benevolent selfishness Is played. Judged from a
little distance William McKinley is thought the most generous and
self-sacrificing of men. He Is all urbanity, all milk of human kindness
all surrender and compromise. His speech is soft, his glove of velvet'
So smooth and unctuous are all his moods and methods that small
wonder the steel of selfishness and persistency, of Iron will and In
domltable purpose to reach the result aimed at. Is overlooked. But
here in Washington those of us who know William McKinley have
two or three sayings which well sum up the case.
"McKinley placates and placates and has his own way In the end."
"McKinley compromises and compromises and ends In compro
mlslng."
"McKinley surrenders all non-essentials and through such surrender
comes out victorious in everything of importance." '
These are true sayings. They cut to the quick of his character ani
his instinctive methods. If it were worth while we could IlluMriti*
them with a score or a hundred of citations. Not a day peases but
some incident pays tribute to his power In these directions He makw
peace between political factions, brings together as friends men who
have long- been foes, through small favors puts his retinue men -who
are predisposed to stand aloof, and all for the single but well con
cealed purpose of building up William McKinley and making him in
vincible.
Â« * â¢ i
In the estimation of the Ill-Informed public the character of BfcKln
ley has been wholly subordinate to that' of Hanna. The child X
asked if McKinley would still be President were Hanna to die u
famous. I}ut this, too. Is a myth. It may surprise a goodly number
of people to learn that Instead of Hanna eclipsing McKinley It Is Han
na who Is as clay In the hands of the Presidential potter ' Hanna is
at heart the sincerer, ml!der man, no matter what manners indicate
Hanna loves McKinley; MsKinley uses' Hanna. Wholly contrary to
the general belief, it is not the chairman of the National Republican
Committee who Is the stronger willed, the more selfish, dominant. <
THE Emperor of Epigrams." In this way some cne has
characterized AVilliam Jennings Bryan.
It is a good characterization. In it we find a key
to the marvelous control of his* party which he has been
able to maintain for four years. In it we find, too, a
clew to the means by which he has made himself the
leader of that party In the pending campaign, despite the fact
that he has persisted in clinging to a policy which four-fifths of
his followers are weary of.
William J. Bryan is now the secord man on the American
continent. He is easily second in his power for good or evil, in
the influence which he exerts upon millions of his fellow citi
zens and upon the future of his country. Many think him first,
not second, and as to which he Is we must wait a while before
j making up our judgment.
Such a power as this is not acquired wholly by accident. It
is not altogether a freak. There must be a rational explanation
of it through analysis of the man's character and his works in
their relation to the human nature and average impulses of tho
political party which he dominates. This rational explanation
we now seek.
Without doubt we have found It in his fecund facility for
producing epigrams. His Is the sovereignty of shibboleth.
But mere cleverness in the saying of thingsâ in the forging
of phrases which take on luminosity, like the proverbs and tho
! electric signs of the soapmakers â would not alone suffice to
j make a great leader. The times must have been ripe for him.
The spiritual condition of his party must have been such as to
: make the ground fallow, arid, athlrst, eager to drink and ab
sorb and give forth.
â¢ â¢ â¢
So It was. The Democratic party was In a state of reaction.
Ever the party of the masses, always the party of the under
dog, it was by nature of its constituent elements and ail its tra
ditions better fitted for brave opposition from without than for
: successful performance within the citadels of power and respon
sibility. Stated as an irreducible minimum. Democracy is a par
ty which instinctively and persistently places its left hand upon
the sacred books, with its right habitually gesticulates, while it.s
voice is lifted up in solemn and eloquent defense of the old
I ideals and the early principles. It is the party of discontent,
not of, deeds.
1 Four years ago Democracy was in possession of the Govern
ment. It had responsibility, but was dissatisfied with itself.
â¢ Grover Cleveland was in the White House, but the masses of
the party were discontented with him. For four years â yes, for
twelve years â Democracy had been under the control of men
who were not really and truly. Democratic. The plebeians had
been compelled to stand aside, and the patricians had come to
the front.
At Chicago, in 1S92, these latter had made their last stand.
The new and undemocratic class of men, men in sympathy with
the current developments of our national life â practical men,
business men, corporation men, even plutocratsâ were still hold-
Ing the reins. William C. Whitney was their master spirit. They
nominated again Grover Cleveland, the stolid high priest created
by their regime. Republicans and Germans elected him. and he
ruled four years. Each year he became less a Democrat, fur
ther from true sympathy with Democracy. All through his last
administration discontent smoldered and flickered. In l&Dd it
broke forth into a fierce flame. Chicago became the center of
the conflagration.
This reaction of Democracy against itself came colncldently
with vast discontent among the people. Times were hard. Tho
country was In one of those ever recurring periods of stoppage
and distress, periods sure to follow epochs of elevation an.l
inflation as surely as winter follows summer. The two dis
contentsâthe political unrest of the sentimental under-do^
Democracy and the economic inflammation of a people wno
were savagely conscious of the disease and wildly seeking tha
remedyâ came together. They met ajid blended in the Chicago
Convention of 1S96. They fused In the white heat of revolution.
Discontent needs nothing so much as a voice. Xothing but a.
voice can direct and lead It. A voice It is ready to fall down
and worship.
Unconsciously to itself, the organized discontent of the
Democratic party at Chicago In 1S96 was seeking a voice which
should summon to its side all the unorganized discontent of
the masses. Suddenlythe voice appeared. It came as a potent
phrase-maker from the prairies. With its "cross of srold and
crown of thorns" It stood with outstretched hands, and tho
scepter was placed in them. The voice was Bryan.
From that day to this the party has remained true to its
instincts, and has made no serious effort to rid itself of the
leadership of the soothsayer. It has recognized the eternal
fitness of things by keeping as Its imperator the utterer of
epigrams, by preserving the dictatorship of the discontented ia
the hands of the chief declalmer.
â¢ â¢ â¢
All his life William Jennings Bryan has been fitting: himseir
for taking advantage of Just such an opportunity as that which
presented itself at Chicago. At college he strove for prizes as
a fledgling orator. He shone In the debating society. All h:s
instincts were toward leadership through the lips. To him all
the titanic forces of American statesmanship appeared to He in
the tongue. To this day his Ideal of the greatest American
may be found in a cheap lithograph hanging upon the walla of
his library In his home at Lincoln â Henry Clay In a long coat
and high collar passionately addressing: the Senate at Wash
ington. Well do we all know that the dominant Â»plrtt of
American life to-day is business. The people who produce,
fabricate, buy. sell, consume a greater bulk of commodities
than any other people of like numbers the sun shines upon
are not afraid of their calling, feel in nowise degraded by
they activities. They carry their dally impulse into their ra
tional ideals. They like public servants who can do business
who are wise in council, efficient in action, constant in con
struction.
Mr. Bryan has no such ideals. "With him the test of states
manship is ability to make a. speech. He has none but tried
and trusty speechmaUera about him. If elected President ho
will place an orator in every Cabinet post, send none but speil
binders abroad, turn all the post offices and collectorships over
to the good talkers. Under Bryanism civil service examina
tions will be resolved Into competitive debating: societies.
Mr. Bryan (Joes, well to cling to this ideal, because it is the secret~f
his power. The party Is like the man. It idealizes the declaimer I
was at Kansas City and sat for hours listening to speeches from men
I had never before heard of. I heard speeches in hotel corridors and
on the streets. The men who sought the Vice Presidency were urged
by their friends because each of them was said to be "an orator second
only to Bryan himself." and "with two such tribunes of the people wÂ«
will sweep the country." The Democratic Idea of life at Waahinrton,
la that it Is one continual round of speechmaking. Committee rooms,
even more potential Senatorial cloak rooms. Cabinet councils of execu
tive abilityâ these are things beyond Its ken.
"We Democrats are a different people from the Republicans." Â«aM
Mr. Dockery. a former Congressman from Missouri, and the next
Governor of that State, at Kansas City. "The Republicans have dis
cipline. They are organized on business lines. The leaders say how
many addresses shall be made, and who shall make them, and that's
all there is of it. But when we Democrats get together every one of
us thinks It his duty to make a speech and all the rest of us t>nâ¢fc it
our duty to stand around and help him."
Of this party Mr. Bryan is the fitting and well-chosen leader.
Mr. McKinley Is such a perfect type of the business and executive
spirit of the American people that he may be said to ba a personlScatlon
of it In our public life.
- â¢ ',: â¢2"v â¢--Â¦.
Mr. Bryan as perfectly represents the elements of protest, of dlÂ«
eent. of discontent, of dreams of higher and better things not definitely
defined or well understood, but which have a good and virtuous sound
when translated Into well-rounded rhetorical periods.
It is for the country to decide which it will trust the reina of
power toâ the tried executive, whose sentiments are often trite or
forced â or the untried administrator whose Meals are perfectly beau
tiful.
But It will not do for any one to assume that Mr. Bryan, because
an idealist and an esotlst, is without the wilt power and force of char
acter which are requisite to a successful management of the natlon'3
affairs. That would be a great mistake, a deception .of one's self.
There Is a widespread Impression, especially in the East, that tho
Democratic candidate for President is shallow, demagoytc; a mere
dreamer, whose dreams fail to co-ordinate, and whose lack of stamina
would make his administration at Washington a rudderless, water
logged derelict, full of surprises and dangers. _
I know Mr. Bryan well, ind I am sure this Is a gross misconception
of his character. Mr. Bryan is in earnest. He believes what he sava.
He really and truly thinks the. cold standard a rreat evil in the
world, the imperialist!? tendencies of the Republican party a menaca
to the republic. These are with him more than matters of the mouth â
they are from the heart. He may be a dreamer, but he dreams hon
estly and without the aid of self-administered narcotics.
â¢ â¢ â¢
If we consider Mr. Bryan as a speaking machine, we roust remem
ber that this Is precisely the sort of mechanism which thÂ« circum
stances and the time have demanded of him. We must remember,
too, that he is a good machine. It was Arthur P. Gorman who said
to the writer not long ago:
"Mr. Bryan Is In one resaect the most remarkable man of the
century. He has been talking steadily for four years, and the more
he talks the stronser he sets. That is something that upsets all 1
theories and contradicts all traditions."
â¢ â¢ â¢
It Is the fashion In some rarts of the country to look upon Mr
Bryan as a dangerous radical of revolutionary tendencies. But many
of his friends complain of him that he Is not radical enough. They
would like him to favor Government ownership, but he refuses. They
talk to him of the Initiative and referendum. He waives them aside
Instead of being a Populist with Democratic leanings. Mr Bryan Is a
Democrat with a love for Populist votes. -;>
â¢ â¢ â¢
Mr. Bryan is a fatalist. He believes he Is to be President of ths
United States before he dies. He Is so confident of It that he does not
permit himself to be worried by doubts and fears, ir it dors not come
in 1900 it will come in 1904. and If not In 13W, then in 1308: for Mr.
Bryan has not the slightest notion of Â«tfpp!nsr aside from Democratic
leadership even If defeated next November. The Democrats who want
to defeat Mr. Bryan this year In order that their party may get rid of I
him once for all are reckoning without the knowledge or co-operation'
of Mr. Bryan.
" " Mr. Bryan Is not only a fatalist, but he is a devout follower of hia
Lord. The day does not pass In which Mr. Bryan neglects to ret down
upon his kneea and seek the guidance of the Master.

MONEY FOR THE JUBILEE.
yvyi ONEY for the grand celebration of Admis
/ \ sion day promises to be promptly and
* * abundantly forthcoming. At any rate a good
start has been made. The wQrk of canvassing the
city for contributions has been hardly ''more than
begun, and already a notable sum has been assured.
The response has been cordial and liberal, and there
is, therefore, a substantial basis for the expectation
that the full amount of the sum desired for the enter
prise will be subscribed in a comparatively short
time. â¢
There are many reasons why the business men of
the city should heartily co-operate with the Native
Sons in making a complete success of every feature
of the programme prepared for the celebration. In
the first place the occasion is one that merits com
memoration on a grand scale in order that its signi
ficance may be impressed not only upon the public of
this coast, but upon the people of the East. We are
to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of California's ad
mission as a State in the Unipn, and the event will
naturally bring about a consideration of what has
been accomplished by Californians in that half cen
tury. The story will be one of progress unparalleled
in history. We have made a development from a
pastoral condition of society to that of a highly or
gantzed community, with a wide diversity of indus
tries and interests, more rapidly and more prosper
ously than any other people. The history of the State
is brief, but it is one of which we can be justly proud,
and to which we can, with credit to ourselves, chal
lenge the attention of all on the anniversary of the
jubilee year of our statehood.
In addition to the patriotic impulses which prompt
the celebration of the day there are material advant
ages to be expected from a grand demonstration,
which will not be overlooked by men who have an
intelligent comprehension of their own interests. At
this time, when the teeming prosperity of the country
affords capital for almost every well-devised enter
prise, it is important that the attention of progressive
business men of all parts of the Union be called to the
rich resources that await development here and the
abundant opportunities for the profitable investment
of capital. The celebration, carried out on a large
and splendid scale, will serve as an advertisement not
only of what has been done in the past but of what
may be expected in the immediate future, and there
fore will be of material benefit in advancing every
industrial and commercial interest of the city and the
State.
Â¦ The programme planned for the occasion by the
Native Sons is an excellent one. The celebration
will extend over four, days, each of which will be
marked by some feature of special moment and at
tractiveness. For their share in the work the various
parlors in this city have set aside sums which in the
aggregate amount to upward of $100,000, and the
parlors of the other sections of the State will expend
fully as much more. Thus from the Native Sons,
acting as an order, there is to be an expenditure of
fully $200,000. For the proper decoration of the city
and similar purposes there is asked of business men,
capitalists and citizens generally $50,000 more. With
that sum a celebration can be provided which will
be national in its reputation, and which will attest at
once the prosperity, the energy and the patriotism
of Californians.
Such is the outlook. The Native Sons have done
well, and are going to have cordial assistance from
other orders and organizations in carrying out the
plan to make the celebration the most splendid and
beautiful ever witnessed on the coast.' It is now for
the citizens to do their share. Come up with the
coin. The cause is c good one, and everybody will
profit by its successful achievement.

BY the decision of the Supreme Court declar
ing the Stratton primary law to be unconstitu

to the better elements of the Republican party in the
fight against the Mint saloon bosses and the corrupt
'gangs of voters that are under their control. It will,
of course, be the duty of the County Committee to
provide for holding primary elections as fairly as pos
sible under the conditions that now prevail; and there
is no reason to doubt that it will act energetically.
Everything, however, must not be, left to the com
mittee. The situation is one that calls for increased
vigilance and activity on the part of all loyal Repub
licans. The issue raised by the decision of the court
must be met fiunly. The fight for honest politics
within the Republican party must be carried on with
greater ardor than ever.
Clean politics will in this contest mean in San
Francisco a clean sweep for ' the Republican ticket.
The brilliant successes of the Republican administra
tion of national affairs, coupled with the disasters
threatened by Bryanism, naturally incline every inde
pendent citizen to ally himself with the Republicans
in the campaign; and in this city that tendency will
be increased in strength by the popular disgust at the
fiascos of Phelan's mismanagement of local affairs.
Thus the Republicans have only to eliminate the
would-be bosses from its councils and nominate good
men to carry the city by an overwhelming majority.
It is a clear case where honesty will be the best policy.
"and where compromise with dishonesty will be a
political blunder of the worst kiiui.
Such being the situation, the profession*! men, the
business men and the working men who uuke up 'he
intelligence and the virtue of the RtjwxbJrÂ«n party
will perceive plainly the duty thit lies fcrt&W ihtnjk

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JULY 30, 1900.
JOHN D. SPRECKELS, Proprietor.
A BAD GUESSER
A CONTRIBUTOR to the current number of the
National Review, in discussing the relation of
the British colonies to the mother country, and
the extent to which they may strengthen the military
and naval power of the empire, quotes from a book
published in 1763 a curious prediction concerning
what were then British colonies in this country. The
title of the book is, "The Reign of George VI â 1900
to 1925," and the work is an attempt to forecast the
future, to describe the conditions of our time, just as
so many recent writers have attempted to forecast the
sort of republic we shall have in the year 2000.
In the passage quoted in the National Review the
writer says: "The population of our various posses
sions in North America is so diverse, their political
institutions so unlike, their interests so opposite, that
it is most improbable that they will ever combine
against Britain. Their numbers are growing so rap
idly that by 1900 there may be as many as eleven mil
lions of British colonists- between the St. Lawrence
and the Mississippi, but they will all be loyal subjects
of the British crown." Â¦
The contrast between that prophecy and the situa
tion as it exists in this year 1900 is sufficient to con
vince any one of the wisdom of Artemus Ward's ad
vice, "Never prophesy unless you know." The di
verse populations of the British colonies did find a
cause and means for combining against Great Brit
ain, and their numbers are now in the neighborhood
of seven times eleven millions. So bad a guess con
cerning the future as seen from- the standpoint of
1763 will of course cause a smile, but after the smile
there should come a recognition of the fact that some
of our calculations of what conditions will prevail a
century from now may be just as erroneous.
- The old chronicler calculated that in this year the
chief danger to the liberties of Europe would be an
alliance between France and Russia. He did not
foresee the rise of German power, nor dream of any
such thing as a terrible Chinese complication.
Neither did he have any conception of a powerful
United States. To protect Europe against the com
bined Gauls and Cossacks he saw but one power â
that of Great Britain and her colonies, and he cheer
fully predicted that the great naval struggle between
the mighty rivals would be turned by warships built
at Boston and Quebec and sent across the Atlantic to
the aid of the mother country.
Of her extensive possessions in America in 1763
Britain now retains none of importance except Can
ada. She has, however, large colonial possessions
elsewhere, and her people are to-day making san
guine predictions of the coming of a time when from
the ports of Australia, South Africa and Canada war
ships will steam to join the fleets of Britain in battle
for naval supremacy. There is, however, a warning
in the failure of the old-time forecast. Perhaps within
a half-century, or less, those great colonies may be as
independent >of the British crown as are" the States of
Last year a great advance was made. This year the
prospects give reason to expect a further advance.
The work of the Board of Agriculture is having its
effect, and throughout the State the people are be
coming more and more interested in it. It is, indeed,
a matter that concerns all, for all are taxed to provide
the appropriations made for it. It is a plain business
proposition that those who pay to support the fair
should exert themselves to share in its benefits. It is
open to all on equal terms, and when all, in propor
tion to their means and their industrial output, take
part in it we shall have a fair that visitors from all
parts of the great West will come to see, and in which
enterprising manufacturers of all parts of the Union
will be seeking for room to make exhibits.
The one thing required to make the State Fair an
event of great importance throughout the Pacific
Coast is a keener interest on the part of the people of
California generally. The efforts made by the board
last year to arouse all sections of the State to actively
participate in the fair produced good results, but after
all were only partially successful. A comprehensive
display of the products of Californian industry, in city
and country, has yet to be made. That exhibit cannot
be forced by the State nor coaxed by the board. It
must be the outcome of a popular movement through
out the Stateâ one in which the leading men in all
lines of production will take part. Should such a
movement be once set going its own momentum
would carry it forward rapidly, and in a time com
paratively short the California State Fair would be
one of the most notable of the annual events of the
nation.
The possibilities of the fair have long been recog
nized, but have never been fully made use of. The
State grants liberal Â«id and the city of Sacramento
has at all times cordially co-operated in making the
fair successful. The State Board of Agriculture has
been earnest, as a rule, in promoting the exhibitions,
and the present board has been especially active and
sagacious. In fact, what was done last year to pro
cure a thoroughly representative exhibit from every
county and every city in the State resulted in an ex
ceptionally fine exposition, so that public interest in
it was perhaps greater than ever before in our history.
There is a wide neld for growth and development
in our State Fair. No other State in the Union, not
excepting the imperial commonwealth of New York,
can achieve so much through an institution of the
kind, for no other State has such rich resources, such
varied agricultural interests and such possibilities for
diversity of industries along all lines of civilized ac
tivity. Moreover, no other State has so much to
expect in the way of benefits, immediate and wide
spread, from a comprehensive annual exposition of
f.he results of her industries. We have not only more
to show than any other State, but a greater incentive
for showing it.
REPORTS from Sacramento concerning ar
rangements now being made for the State Fair
are gratifying to ail who take an interest in that
important annual exhibition of the industries of the
State. The fair of last year was a notable improve
ment over former exhibitions, and the prospects now
give promise of a further improvement this year.
STATE FAIR PROSPECTS.
The East shows few of these favorable indications.
There business continues quiet. The bank clearings
of the country are stiU behind those of 1899, though
the decrease is materially lc?s than a few weeks ago.'
The failures, too, are larger, though, happily, are
mostly small. The iron trade is still in the dumps,
and the gTeat staples, outside of sugar, tea and coffee,
arc generally dull and easy. Wool, however, is show
ing rather more tone again. The country seems to
be doing a midsummer business considerably above
the average, but less than during the record-breaking
year of 1899. The gratifying feature of the commer
cial situation is the general confidence of the people
in the financial policy of the Government, which has
enabled us thus far this year to meet a serious decline
in prices for many staples without a tremor in the
money markets. We are sound, and our financial
policy is sound. We know it, and therefore regard
the recession from the dizzy heights of 1899 as merely
a. natural reaction after a period of feverish trade
activity, to be followed later on, doubtless, with re
newed bustle and increased prosperity.
But the outlook for prices fof farm produce in
California this year is good, independent of the Ori
ental situation. It is now evident that the enormous
crops of fruit, hay and grain predicted early in the
season are not being !.arvested. Concerns whose in
terests lie in buying our produce at low prices are
still crying heavy crop?, but those who produce those
crops know better. The wheat estimates have been
reduced from 1,000,000 tons to 650,000 tons. That
good grain hay is actually scarce is shown by an
unprecedented midsummer advance in quotations of
at least $3 per ton. Oats are rising, barley is harden
ing under an increased demand, the output of dried
apricots has shrunken from an estimate of 1200 cars
to a doubtful 900, the prune crop has decreased from
a heralded 150.000.000 pounds to not more than 125,
000,000, with announcements of continued reductions
in the yield by the Cured Fruit Association, due to
the unusual "drop"; the grape crop will certainly not
be over the average, the hop crop has been cut do;vn
a third, and so on down a long list of farm products.
This docs not mean that there will be any scarcity,
but that the trumpeted reports of enormous crop?,
made some time ago by interested concerns and in
dividuals and still being made with a persistence
â¢worthy of a better cause, are not in accordance with
the facts. The proof of this lies in the undeniable
fact that prices are rising. Grape^ are already being
sold at good figures; the whole dried fruit market iÂ«
working into a stronger condition; hops are quoted
at figures higher than a few weeks ago, and, in fact,
the whole situation is showing increased strength.
This means better prices for the fruitgrower, vine
yardxst and cereal farmer later on, unless something
now unforeseen occurs, and thus indirectly better
times for the whole State. Briefly, almost all crops
ere shorter than proclaimed early in the summer,
and prices are hardening in consequence.
T â \ ROSPECTS for trade are better on the Pacific
Ly Coast, and particularly in California, than in any
*Â¦ other part of the United States. The wars in
the Orient are helping our State out wonderfully. We
are being called upon for all sorts of suppliesâ hay,
horses, oats, provisions, dried and canned fruits, coal,
clothing, miscellaneous groceries â everything, in
brief, that enters into the equipment of armies. True,
most of the clothing and ammunition are produced
in the Ea?t, but we get the lion's share or. the out
fitting. Already the beneficial effects of this military
provision are manifest in higher prices for coal, hay,
oats, horses and a number of other articles, while
advices from New York say that a Chinese war,
which now seems certain, will surely cause a brisk
demand for canned and dried fruits.

Officials of the Oceanic Steamship Com
pany on the dock and aboard the steam
ship Alameda will feel considerably re
lieved this morning when the $2,700,000
worth of golden sovereigns stowed in the
after steerage are removed to the Mint.
The steamer did not get alongside the
dock until after banking hours on Satur
day, so that the treasure had to be left
on board over Sunday. The treasure is
the most valuable that ever came to this
port from Australia and comes very near
ly being the most valuable that ever
crossed the Pacific. The responsibility of
guarding it is very great.
A deck boy by the name of Colburn, a
strapping youth of 20, was entrusted with
the duty of keeping guard at night on
the way across. Just why he was se
lected nobody aboard the ship seems to
know, except that he is known to be per
fectly honest and does not seem to know
what fear means. Every night during the
trip across ColBurn sat on the steerage
hatch with a revolver In his hand and
neither passengers nor crew were per
mitted to visit that portion of the ship.
Before entering and after leaving every
port of call on the voyage the hatch was
orcned and the treasure boxes counted
and carefully inspected to see that, the
seals had not been tampered with.
Yesterday the guard of customs officers
was doubled on the Alameda. Two police
men also stooa watch at the gang plank
and none except the ship's orncers were
allowed on the dock. \\ nen the treasure
was placed aboard at Sydney it is said
that more than a score of detectives and
police officers in citizen's clothes mingled
with the crowd on the dock.
Sailor Falls From Aloft.
The schooner Compeer, which sailed Sat
urday w.ith a big cargo for Pago Pago, re
turned to port yesterday to land William
Doyle, an able seaman, who fell from aloft
to the deck soon after the vessel had
cleared the Heads, sustaining a compound
fracture of the leg. The injured man was
taken to the Marine Hospital. As soon
as Captain Larsen can secure another
man to tajce l>oyle's place the Compeer
will continue her voyage.
Hancock Finally Gets Away.
The transport Hancock finally got away
for Taku yesterday morning, passing out
through the heads about 10 o'clock. She
got away from the dock Boon after mid
night, but dropped anchor in the stream.
Captain Struve preferring- to wait for
daylight. There was "a hot old time"
aboard all night, because many of the
marines had managed to get whisky
aboard and proceeded to stow it away
before the authorities had time to search
the ship. There were several fights and
one or two men were placed In the brig
to sober up and keep out of trouble. It
was fortunate for many of the marines
that the transport was delayed, for they
had found boon companions uptown and
made a night of it. The boatmen had
plenty to do all night taking the strag
glers "aboard.
Shag Bock Is No More.
An official surve*- has been 1 made of Shag

as a result of which the work has been
accepted by the Government and the con

vey demonstrated that there is thirty feet
of water over the rock at extreme low
tide, which is more than was expected
when the work of blowing up the obstruc
tion was attempted.
Schooner Commerce Launched.
The four-masted schooner Commerce
was successfully launched from Hay &
Wrirht's shipyard at Alameda Point Sat
urday afternoon. She is a sister ship of
the Philippine, Expansion and Luzon.
Miss Nellie von der Merden. the daugh
ter of D. von der Merden, one of the own
ers of the new vessel, christened the Com
merce as she slid from the ways. The
schooner is owned by Martin Sanders,
Henry Klrchman. S. Forter and others.

ever built at Hay & Wright's shipyard.

against T. L. Reed, president of the Reed
Oil Company, by W. I. Roberts and P. R.
Pitney, stockholders of the Reed Crude
Oil Company. The Los Angeles Times
gives the following account:
"Messrs. Roberts and Pitney want their
interests in the Section Thirty-four Fuel
and Oil Company, which was absorbed by
the Reed Oil Company. The Section
Thirty-four Fuel and Oil Company was
composed of Air. Reed, his two sons and
Messrs. Roberts and Pitney. It is alleged
that the members of the company dele
gated authority to Mr. Reed to sell their
holdings to the Reed Oil Company. The
deal wiis consummated and it was under
stood that the land, which was quite ex
tensive, brought $20 an acre and no more.
Now it is further nlleged that at the time
of the absorption of the Keed Oil Com
pany's interests by the Reed Crude Oil
Company, the disclosure was made that,
besiues getting $20 an acre for section 34,
owned by the Fuel and Oil Company.
Mr. Reed had obtained besides a.

Several spurs will be needed because the

Now claims are being nled on the Colo

The Los Angeles Herald says:
"At the Government Land Office In Los
Angeles it is reported that since Judge
Rosa rendered his decision regarding
scripping, there has been an Increase in
the number of claims tiled in that office
ostensibly for agricultural purposes but
evidently â¢ to cover oil prospects
This is taken as indicating a belief that
an agricultural claim Is preferred bv
many people to a placer mining claim for
holding oil land found In the public do
main. As far as can be ascertained,
there Is little disposition to make these
filings supplemental to previous filings as
mineral land, though the records of the
office do not cover mineral claims, and
consequently the Land Office officials do
not speak authoritatively on that subject.
It is believed, however, that most of the
claims are being filed on new discoveries
of oil prospects. It is stated that home
stead claims are given the preference over
scripping claims, because it is cheaper and
is fully as effective where the land is
classed as fit for agricultural purposes."

THE officials of the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association In this
city have addressed a communication to the people of the United States
vv...ch is of unusual Interest at this time. It is especially novel as being
the official utterance of the powerful organization known as the Chinese
Six Companies. Rarely does any organization of its Ftrenjrlh address lt-
to the public directly, almost invariably finding some other mode of convey
ir.p to the outside world any matter it wishes mnde public. The communica
tion takes the form of a set of resolutions, as follows:
The Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Asso
t:.itl. n (Chinese Six Companies), an organiza
tion comprising the societies of Ninjr Tunjr.
Yup. Konjj Chow, Yun* Wo. Hop Won.
Yu<Â»n Hoi, Fhen Hinir and Yuen Woh, the sev
eral component* being societies which ramify
thr.iuÂ£hout the United f=tatcs=. and comprise In
their several memberships nearly all Chinese
}-?orÂ»le resident within the United States, sends
to the peos>le of the United States sreetinjc:
la view cf the numerous resolutions, declara
tions and statements Issued by various Chinese
orgairtzations and individuals in divers parts
at the United States declarir.tr the views and
statue of their authors In relation to the ex
isting conditions within the Chinese empire
â¢with regard to the foreign i<eoples therein, it
is j>rooÂ»er and desirable that the ChinÂ«-sÂ«? Six
Companies shall on bthalf of what Is practi
cally the Chinese population of North America
Ifive expression to the American public of the
views which It holds regarding the Chinete-
Western conditions bo far as they appertain to
the people under our purview or jurisdiction.
No Tartars in America,
First, we desire to accentuate the fact that
the people from China resident within the United
ttates are cZl Chinese. None of them are Tar
tars nor Manchuria ns. They are from the
Kwang Tur^g province of Southern China, of
vhich Canton Is the chW city and Hcngkong
the port of er.try. The Uovernment of China is
not Chinese but Manchurian. beln^ the victor
of a Jormer conquest of the Chinese. This con
quest occurred at a period so remote in our his
tory that the Chinese have long peacefully sub
mitted to the rule ot the Manchus, and while
there is always a certain dopree of feeling and
frictloa among jartiefe In China over the dis
criminations made by the Manchu rules agaia^t
the Chinese in repard to the inelipibility of the
Utter to hold certain offices, yet it may be
laid that for many years the nation has, com
fortably or uncomfortably, rested as a. whole
unjÂ»r the Manciurian rule.
The population of China, contrary to the
crinion held in the west, is exceedingly indis-
I'osefi to travel. They are a non-emigrating
ji>-. lie; a people for the most part who never
rorÂ»ve rfuririE their whole lives a. distance of
tarty miles away from the place of their birth.
liather than remove from their native soil to
take up residence elsewhere the Chinese popu
lation as a whole would rather meet death:
and In fact thousands of them do at periods
calmly meet cieatn in districts etneken by
famine rather than leave those places and re
s >rt to adjacent localities of comparative plen
ty, which they mifcht readily do by merely ris-
Iriir and pmoeedlac Â»n foot.
Not Averse to Foreign Goods.
Nor do the?* people resist the delights ej
f Â¦ rJ*-'l by w*-*tÂ«-rn i^roducts of nec^^siiy and
lcxury. Where such articles do not conflict
with some superstition, they are readily pur
chased and their ue? adopted. In the stores
Of fcuch districts are many products of the
w*-st. which have fuund their way thither from
thp pf-a< oast towns.- and which were in com
rr.un rise anvng the people. It appears, there-
Cora, that inherently the people of China are
r. t a\f-r** \r, foreign jieoples or their wares
K...I to a. certain extern thÂ«?y will adopt their
customs Vberc Fuch customs are associated
v;th the run which Chinese purchase ainl
use. .But within recent years, however, much
a* we deplore and denounce the fact, it is nev
ertheless true that there has actually prown
up lr. China among a considerable percentage,
especially cf the northern population, a distrust
cf the westfra peoples, and this distrust art
fully manipulated by politicians, may be read
ily fanned into hatred oÂ£ those against w-h.->m
it war directed. This Wlir.e has undoubtedly
teen occasioned by the seizure of the territory
of China which certain Â¦Testers nations have
imposed upon the <Â»mj'ire ar.1 its people. The
explicit expression of this malice is apparent,
iarticuiarly against the missionary element
within the country.
The feeling of outrage which haÂ« attended
the loss ni pieces of the empire has. therefore.
drome bound up and associated with the na
tive view oi the presence of foreigners, and the
missionary cult have been hy a large element
looked upon as a *."une i.t national danger, be-
JnjET reÂ»rardÂ»'i1 a* a body ot people who. if their
presence were tolorated in the country without
contrary guarantees from the Governments
under whose prr.tcrtlon thoy f-slst, would ulti
mately cause the abolition of the empire and
the mirtverrton of the country under the rules
< '. their home O"Vfrnmentf. It is a fact which
every enlightened mind will recognize that the
missionaries have conferred a vast and Im
measurable benefit upon those parts of China
Â¦which they have favored with th-Â»ir presence
arid their work, and the view taken by the
, anti-foreign element that the re^ldf'nce of the
ml^sioTiarieg will cause a dissolution of the em
pire Is. of course, unfounded.
Cause of Boxer Movement
Thl? feeling and belief that the missionaries,
if toJf rated in the country, will eventually
cause national disruption, is at the bottom of
the 13 >xer movement. Certain person* deslpn
â¢irg, dr.ubtk?s. to wlze the reins of govern-
Tnfnt, have egged <">n the mob, driven by this
Impulse until Furh has culminated In the out
rages and murders ot which we have heard
rejiort.
The Kwang-tuncr peoj-le have charactert/tics
Â¦ ttVWt different ir>m the helanre of China's
j>opu!ation. KÂ»ane-tune has of old been the
pieat onramtrrla! district of China. Its mer

ever hpÂ»*n thrive d'.Fpr**! to emigration and
removal to neirhb"Hng and remote places in
qiirt of orportur.ilies to better their material
conditions. Those f-ersons are Chinese proper,
vhile the persons among whom the intense
Â£r.tl -foreign feeling Is now producing disturb
ances are largely the Manchurian element.

The leper settlement on. the Island of
Molokai of the Hawaiian group is to be
duplicated In the Philippines. This mat
ter has had the attention of the medical
staff of the army for some time and the
conclusions formed from an exhaustive

it out of existence, a board of officers la hereby

LINCOLN, Nebr., July Â».-Mr. Bryan
is so well along with his notiScatioa
speech and his plans are so well devel
oped that he hopes to be able to announce
his itinerary for the trip to Indianapolis
and return. He has no knowledge of tho
time and place for his notification by the
Populists and Free Silver Republicans and
it is not believed his present itinerary
takes Into consideration that function.
Local politicians had hoped that If it was
to be in the West Mr. Bryan's home la
Lincoln would be the place selected, but
it is now thought Topeka, Kans.. has tha
first call and will probably secure the
meeting. It Is thought possible the trip
to Chicago of Secretary Edgerton of tho
Populist National Committee may have
some bearing on the question. Mr. Edger
ton left this evening and expects to seÂ«
Mr. Towne while in Chicago, but said
that was no part of his mission.
Mr. Bryan said to-day there was not
the slightest foundation for the story sent
out from here that he had narrowly es
caped serious injury by being struck by a
golf ball. .

Asked if he would endeavor to reach

"I think not. unless circumstances war

to render possible the success of such an
expedition. In the country's state of fer

Outside of that I am not empowered, to da

TO INVESTIGATE IS
ROCKHILL'S MISSIOfI
Locked up in the tanks is an ex-convlct
whom the police strongly suspect of being
responsible for a number of unusually
daring burglaries. The man's name is
Henry Wintgen. He was arrested yester
day afternoon after a desperate struggle
and taken to the City Prison.
The speciilc crime for which Wintgen
was arrested was that of stealing a gold
watch from Mrs. French, his sister-in
law Â¦who lives on Eleventh street, near
Mission. The stolen timepiece was found
in a pawnshop in Chinatown, where It
had been sold Dy Wintgen for a few dol
lars. "When searched a number of pawn
tickets were found on the prisoner, show
ing that he had disposed of various arti
cles of jewelry to different pawnbrokers.
Wintgen has been sought for by the po
lice for some time.
As it was known that he was responsi
ble for several burglaries committed in the
Western Addition Captain Seymour de
tailed Detectives Dinan and Wren to ar
rest, him. While they were searching for
him he broke into his sister-in-law's house
and stole her watch. Yesterday the police
learned that Wintgen was paying a visit
to tho Chinese quarter, presumably fb
dispose of some stolen articles, and Po
liceman Dougherty, who is acquainted
with him, was sent to arrest him. After
considerable* trouble the officer located
Wintgen in a Chinese pawnshop on Wash
ington street, where he was trying to sell
a gold ring which Is supposed to have
been stolen. Realizing that ho "was up
against it." as he expressed it, Wintgen
made a determined resistance, but waa
overpowered after a struggle and escorted
to the City Prison.
According to the police Wintgen is a
desperate crook. Several years aeo he
robbed a bucolic stranger on Mission
street and was e^ven a short term in San
Quentln State prison. Prior to that he
served a term In Folsom for daylight bur
glary.
Since his release from the penitentiary
wintgen, bo the police say, has committed
at least a half dozen burglaries in the
Western Addition and Mission. Most of
P's booty was recovered from pawnshops
In Chinatown, where it had been sold bv
him. To-day he will be formally charged
with the theft of his Bister-in-laVs
watch.

If yesterday's attendance is any cri
terion the Ingleside Coursing Association,
which is enjoying its end of the schedule
of doe running" at San Mateo Park, will
have had one of the most successful
coursing meetings of the season when it
closes to give the Union Park manage
ment a tvrn at the game.
The sixteen dog champion event was, of
course, the main attraction and the large
crowd showed Its interest In the stake by
playing their favorites quite heavily.
Short end?, as on the opening day, made
! a good Bbowing and though not so plentl
j ful, still they won often enough to make
it in:erosting. , _
I Curtis & h<ins* Beacon took first money
I in the champion stake, with Russell, Allen
& Wilson's fcpiicf ul as runner up. Ueacon
! was a favorite all through and proved
equal to his renutation of being in a class
bv himself. He had a hard go with Ire
land in the second round, securing 14
1 points to his opponent's 10, but came bacK
! strong against Flora .McDonald in the
I next go and beat her handily. In the tinal
he got the flag from Spiteful in a sixty
thrt-e second coursing:; score Sâ 5.
Snapper Garrison was a. strong factor
in this stake and while he lasted was a
good investment for his backers. In the
rir.-u round against Grefnhall. who was
posted a. 2H; to 1 favorite. Snapper took
his opponent's measure with a close score.
Then against Sterl A: Kncnvles' For Glory.
Moriaritys dog extended himself. Ihe
talent thought little of Snapper's chances
of winning this go and made For Glory
a favorite at 4 to 1, the best odds of the
day. In a hard working course all over
the field Snapper got the decision and
when the red na_g was raised the score
stood 21 to 12 in hia favor. The work was
too much for him, however, and iu the :
next round the runner up beat him point
less. Palo Alto beat Warship in the lirst
round in a. hard race and then lost to the
runner up in the next go.
The open stake was al?o captured by
the Curtis & Sons kennel. Vulcan beat
the LÂ«opex entry. Wanda; in ,the deciding |
round after an exciting in and out no go.
The dogs were given a short rest and then j
slipped to a lively hare. The spectators ;
took a strong interest in the course and :
aÂ« either dog would score a point its back- ;
ers would try to encourage their favorite :
with veils of approval. The jack was ;
full of speed and managed to keep a safe
distance from its would-be captors and
finally beat them to the escape just as a
relief dog had joined in. The course
lasted 2 i; > minutes and was the longest of
the day." Bohe reached the sixth round
when she was beaten in a close race by
the stake winner, who was a 1 to 2 short

RAI^EIGH, N\ C. July 29.-A genera!
Section will be held in this State next

limiting the electorial franchise will b'
voted on. There is apparently little doub*
es to the result of the election both as to
the amendment and the State ticket It
3Â«ow seems to simply a question of ma
jority. The opponents of the amendment
acknowledge that it will be adopted. As
the amendment and the Democratic ticket
will run very close together, the Populists
ajid Republicans have practically aband
oned their State ticket in an effort to
elect a majority of the Legislature and
leturn Marion Butler to the United States
Senate. The battle has been fought on
the race issue, brought to the front by
the proposed franchise amendment, by
which 80,000 ignorant negro voters are to

noon a drunken tight occurred, in which
several men from the adjoining mining
camp of Russell participated. James Per

husband's store and looted the safe, tak
ing about $1000. Detective Gibson was de
tailed on the case, and two weeks after
ward found the woman In a house on Clay
street. The money was never recovered.
Last Thursday Soon Toy was lured to
the Pacific Mail Steamship dock on tha
pretense that one of her friends was to
sail for China on the Doric. After she
had left her home her husband had oc
casion to open the safe and was etartled
to find that the family jewelry, valued at
over $j00, was mlssinp. Ho found that his
wife had left the mail dock, and was mys
tified as to why she did not return to her
home, but waited until two nights after
ward before he made a report to the
police.
Two years aco Hang Hop purchased his
wife. She was a slave girl when he mar

It is several years since Ryan has been
on the coast and the pugilistic fraternity
is In rather an anxious mood to know just
how the great middleweight looks.
As the fight in which Ryan will be one
of the pugilists will not take place until
September 7, plenty of time is left him
for training. He will rest for a short per
jÂ°f before tho preliminary work is be-
B Ja- ck Moffattf whose performance
against Xeill showed that he is a fighter
of more than ordinary ability, will not
arrive until the early part of August,
The conditions under which Ryan and
Moffatt will enter the ring are satlsfac
tory to both parties. Nothing now re
mains but actual training and preparation
for the big fight.

San Francisco 7, Sacramento 2.
The largest crowd that has as yet
passed Into the Recreation grounds to see
a baseball game came from the four sides
of the city yesterday afternoon and filled
every bit of space In the grand stand and
bleachers. They went away gloating over
a local victory which was a. well deserved
one, for every wearer of Hank's uniform
played his best. Doyle was discovered
and sentenced to club smashing. At times
he received bunches of clubbings, espe
cially in the second Inning, when five py.ro
technical displays were "unloaded" on the
throng.
The Senators, champions and leaders,
played ragged ball in spots. This may
have been due to the disorganization of
the team. Hughes' arm is sore and Bill
Devereaux is sick. This made a change of
positions necessary, lburg pitched care
ful ball, permitting of no bunches by the
toga wearers.
Until the last of the -second the gama
was even tempered, but then Doyle was
untwisted for live hits, four of Hank's
men covering the plate before Frisco was
sent to the field. Four bad ones placed
Levy on first and a hit bv Krug covered
the first pair of bags. Reilly bunted poor
ly to third, shutting out Levy at that sta
tion. Then Iburgr rapped a hot one to
Stultz, who fumbled and Krug scored on
the play. Brockhoff swatted the ball to
Hughes, beating it to first, and the sacks
were crowded with Wasps. A hit to cen
ter by Hildebrand scored Iburg and a hit
by Schwartz to Eagan resulted in Hilde
brand s death at second, but on an at
tempted double play Hanlon allowed the
ball to slip through him. in consequence
of which Brockhoff scored. There was
another hit by Pabst, but Sully's out end
ed the inning.
The fifth brought a run to Sacramento.
Stanley earned the initial bag on a hit.
advanced a station on Doyle's sacrifice,
and went to third on Shanahan's hit,
scoring on the throw in of Stultz's out to
Levy.
Two runs and two hits were added to
the score by the locals in the fifth./ Sulli
van jogged to first and moved to third on
Krug s hit. Then some poor base throw
ing resulted In forcing Sullivan and Krujr
around the bags to the haven of rest.
The seventh gave Hank the seventh run.
Pabst rolled out a two-bagger, stole third
and scored on a passed ball.
In the eighth bacramento put Eagan
over the rubber. He went to first on an
error by Krug and to second on Hughes'
hit, scoring on Hanlon's hit. The score:

MORNTNG OAXLAND GAME.
San Francisco 9, Sacramento 2.
Nothing but nine runs would satisfy
Hank's nine swatters in the morning
game. They got a tasto of victory out of
Saturday's contest, and they liked its lin
gering effects. Perrine. who was quite
easy the day before, was called upon to
do box work before the game was fin
ished. Shanahan started on the slab for
Sacramento and was quite an easy target
for the local men. Helped along by the
errors of his team, Shanahan made run
getting a feature of San Francisco's
play.
In the fifth irming five hits by Frisco
resulted in three runs. Everybody had a
chance at it, and the champions were
kept busy chasing the ball from one end
of the field to the other. The San Fran
ciscos did not play their customary earn
est, hard-fielding game. .Reilly with a
couple of slim chances committed two
grievances. Pabst. Levy and Krug were
also guilty of breaches of good baseball
playing.
Knell, who represented Hank in the
box, allowed but four hits oft his deliv
ery, but one of these was a hdmer by
McLaughlin. The score:

Policeman William Gelman of the Cen

thief a few nights ago.
Geiman. whose beat is on Grant ave
nue, was informed that a room In a lodg
ing-house on Bush street had been broken
into and a silk dress and a costly hat
taken. Anxious to swell his record Gel
maji, who is considered one of the most
vigilant officers on the force, after mak
ing an examination of the room and get
ting a description of the stolen articles,
started out to find the thief.
After searching the various haunts in
the tenderloin for the culprit without ob
taining a trace of him Geiman walked
along Grant avenue In the hope of meet-

knew was looking for him. had donned
the dress and hat. His face was hidden
by a heavy veil, which he also took from
the room, making his disguise complete.
Geiman reported the occurrence to his
superiors and several men were at once
sent out to round up the thief, but with
out success. Since then Geiman has been
very careful about mistaking a crook for
a woman. He vows that he will make it

small mite of money and the tools with
which he gained a livelihood. Being a
cripple and having the weight of four
score years upon him, he is unable to per
form manual labor. He had earned his
daily bread by making wax flowers, but
the implements with which this work was
done were taken by the thieves, so as a
last resort he sought the poorhouse,
where he expects to end his existence.
Hyland was born and lived in St. Gal

made wax flowers and figures and on the
proceeds of this handiwork raised a large
family. He came to Chicago when he
gave up his home in the beautiful Alps
arid pursued the same line of work.
Kventually he decided to come "West, and
arrived In San Francisco three days ago.
He secured lodgings at a house the name
of which he cannot remember, and after
paying the first night's rent had but $5 in
his pocket.
That j.ight three thieves entered his
room and two of them held him while the
third went through his clothes. The old
man is a cripple and could make no re
sistance. "When the robbers left they had
with them not only the money but his
tools.
Until last night Hyland roamed over the
streets. He had no money to buy new
tools and finally gave up in despair. He
asked to be sent to the Almshouse, and

The real estate market is just beginning
to feel the Influence -of the approaching
eeason. The summer dullness is begin
ning to wear off, axid the indications are
that the coining month will see a notice
able improvement, while the winter Is
looked forward .to as a lime of great
activity. The railroad situation on thi3
fcide of the bay is expected to bring about
Central activity to the northward of Oak
lar.d, for the San Pablo avenue electric
lin* is being constructed to West Uerke
ley and will be in operation In the course
cf a month or two. The Macdonald-Hen
thaw electric road from Point Richmond
will take detinite shape before the Contra
Costa Supervisors one week from Mon
day, and this will boom real estate be
tween Oakland and the present terminus
of the Santa J'e fc yj?tem. The general
opinion seems to be that something will
Portly be done with the California and
Nevada Kail road, which lends additional
Interest to realty in that section.

the extra-Judicial announcement of Chief
Justice Taney and the majority of the
Supreme Court that the Missouri compro
mise was void, because Congress had no
constitutional power to legislate against
the interests of tne owners of slaves any
more than against those of owners of
other forms of property. Slave owners,
therefore, had the right to carry their
slaves wherever they chose upon Federal
territory without Jeopardy to their own
ership. Douglas stood loyally by the de
cision. To other minds the argument of
the Chief Justice seamed to knock the
foundations from under his popular sov
ereignty doctrine: but he strove with skill
and plausibility to harmonize the oppos
ing views and carried with him the North
ern Democrats. These found themselves,
like the Democrats of the South, first dep
recating and apologizing for slavery, then
condoning and finally admiring and advo
cating it as a boon and a blessing to the
African race and the Ideal condition of
the negro. So the great party stood com
mitted, temporarily, as a matter of parti
san policy to the support of slavery: ancl
by the decision of the court the political
issue between the parties was clearly de
tined The Democrats henceforth upheld
the view that the Territories were the
common possession of the whole nation,
purchased at the cost of Southern as well
as Northern sacrifice, and that all prop
erty riphts were equally sacred there.
From this vantage ground Southerners
were able ere long as we shall see to
take one step further and declare sla\
eS established in the Territories with the
United States as Us guardian.
Against thin position the Republicans
maintained that the rights of slavery
were and had always been only local and
statutory and not to be recognized be
yond the limited sovereignty of the States
which created them. ;
Douglas and the Lecompton Consti-
tution.
In 1837 Kansas renewed her application
for statehood and the pro-slavery Legis
lature presented the Lecompton constitu
tion This. It will be remembered, was
never adopted by the people of the Ter
ritory The pro-slavery convention which
framed the pro-slavery document permit
ted the voters to pronounce upon one sec-
Ifon only, and not until by a new Legisla
ture the whole constitution was submit
ted to the people. In January. 1ST.6, would
the free State settlers take part in an
election upon the question. Then a ma
loritv of over 10.000 was given against it.
uro-Mavery settlers declining to vote.
The discussion respecting the Lecomp
ton constitution was now transferred to
the chambers of Congress and became a
matter of national Interest. The adminis
tration was det^rtnined to force the ob
noxious instrument upon the undeniably
Farge free State population but It was
soon found that a strong Northern ele
ment in the party would resist the nefa
rious scheme. Douglas Proved his real
manliness and courage and honesty by
boldly opposing the plot.
The administration wing of the party
was enraged at the defection of their
ablest leader. All the power o f govern
ment patronage was enlisted against him.
but as time passed it appeared that in
-Dite of all Douglas was gathering to
himself the real strength of the party,
both North and South. His popular-sov
Â«relÂ»nty doctrine was truly popular, and
drew to his side many Republicans even.
A stormy Congressional debate lasting for
two months finally resulted In the pass
ace of the Lecompton measure, but the
bill contained provisos which required an
other popular vote in Kansas, and the
vote was again overwhelmingly against
It. . _ '-Â¦Â¦ ."'' _ .
The Lincoln-Douglas Debates.
It was Illinois politics which determined
the course of national politics at this
critical Juncture. The Legislature elected
there In 1S3S would choose a United States
Senator. The Democratic convention re
nominated Douglas, whose course upon
the Lccompton matter was enthusias
tically approved and had made him more
than ever tho Idol of his party In his own
State. Some of the Republican leaders
also urged that no opposition should be
made to his return to the Senate. This
was Greeley's View. But Douglas could
not command the full confidence of the
Republicans: he had been too. lately an
aggressive enemy. Had Greeley's advice
been followed, had the Illinois Republl-
Kansas for free soil, had undertaken by
force to free the Missouri slaves, and came
In 1S59 with a few followers to Harper's
Ferry, Va.. to carry out a long-cherishcl
plan for liberating the slaves of Virginia.
But the plot failed; the negroes did not
rise at his bidding. Brown and six of hla
associates were tried and executed aa
criminals.
Coming, as this event did. In the midst
of xjie already extreme tension of, feeling
respecting slavery. It roused a perfect
frenzy of Indignation and resentment m
the South, and a most profound regret in
the North, coupled with a measure of
sympathy for the misguided haters of
slavery and admiration for the heroism
with which they met their tragic fate.
But the occurrence probably did not alter
the course of history. The Republican
maiorlties In the autumn elections were,
perhaps, slightly less, but they were still
majorities. The bitterness of sectional
feeling was for the time intensified, but
no drop of gall was needed In the cup of
the wine of wrath which was already at
the nation's lips. "It presses on the ir
repressible conflict," wrote Greeley.
Tho Resolutions of Jefferson Davis.
Tho approaching Presidential election
was now the absorbing topic of thought
throughout the country. The danger of a
dissolution of the Union was seen to be
Imminent. A feeling of uneasiness per
vaded the land. Commercial Interests
took alarm. The North, and especially
the West, had suffered severely in the
panic of 1S57, whose effects had hardly
reached the South. If '"ar ">etween the
sections were to follow, or even the los*
of Southern trade, ruin to vast numbers
was inevitable. "Union-saving" meetlng-a
were held In many Northern cities, which,
voiced the general anxiety. The people
called upon their leaders, and particu
larly upon those known to be aspirants
for the Presidency, to state their posi
tions. Seward. Lincoln. Douglas and JÂ«f
ferson Davis responded. The Kepubllcan
chiefs maintained the lofty ground of,
moral principle which they had previous
ly taken, and the people of the North
gathered by their side with a growlnar
solemnity and earnestness of purpose rare
in political controversy. But the preg
nant, significant fact was that made clear
by the utterances of the Democratic lead
ers. The great party was hopelessly di
vided: the last strand of nationality was
parting: disunion was inevitable.
Douglas delivered a speech In the Sen
ate January 12. 1860. In which he avowed
himself determined to yield no Jot of prin
ciple or position, to make no concessions
for the sake of the nomination which ho
did not seek, though willing to receive It.
Jefferson Davis of Mississippi was tho
ablest of the pro-slavery leader?, and to
him all eyes turned. Would the Southern
Democrats take any backward steps? On
February 2 Davis brought forward In tho
Senate a series of resolutions setting forth
the claims of that win? of the party
which he represented. They werÂ© in Â«f
' feet the ultimatum of the Southern Dem
ocrats to the nominating convention soon
to meet. The fourth of these resolutions
was the significant one. It averred that
| no constitutional power belonged to Con
gress or to any Territorial legislature to
impair the right to hold slaves in the Ter
ritories, and that the Federal Government
was In duty bound to afford to slaves In
Federal Territories the same protection
as was due to other property. Thus the
i two factions of the Democratic party de
! fled each other. The Davis resolutions
! were debated for three months* and then
! passed. JESSE MACY.

The great political question In Oakland
to-day is what effect will the Supreme
Court decision anent the Stratton primary
law have upon the Congressional situation
in the Third District. While the managers
for each side claim that it will have no
direct bearing upon the result. It certain
ly will have the effect of transferring the
control of the primary from the Board of
Supervisors to the Congressional commit
tee of the Third District. Of course, the
Metcalf men had a large working major
ity In the Board of Supervisors, but they
absolutely control the Congressional com
mittee. So while County Assessor Henry
P. Dalton does not think that this will af
fect his chances at all. County Clerk
frank C. Jordan, his campaign manager,
is talking about getting out of politics
and retiring to a ranch or going to the
Boxer country.
If there is one man more than another
who should know what to do under these
circumstance? it Is County Clerk Frank
C. Jordan, the hero of many a hard
fought campaign.
Senator F. S. t?tratton holds that the old
Porter primary law is in existence and
that the approaching primaries will be
held under that law. But so many pri
mary laws have been attempted since the
Porter primary law went into effect that
r.o one seems to know just how far the
Porter primary law may have been
amended or just exactly what it is.
One thing is certainâ that the center or
the scene is shifted from the County
Clerk's office to the Congressional com
mittee Under the Stratton primary law
the County Clerk had solo supervision of
the Great Register, and County Clerk
Jordan claimed the right to purge tne old
register for the approaching primary.
This claim was not looked upon with fa
vor by the Metcalf men. so the County
clerk's office was the center of observa
tion by the politicians engaged In the
Congressional fight.
Now the scene Is shifted to the Con
gressional committee, which has tho call
ing of the primary, the setting of the con
vention date and the appointing of the
flection officers.
"I had hoped that the Strnttnn primary
I law would hold." said ConfreBsman Vle
i tor H. Metcalf. "because a good primary
| law means much for party harmony. I
hoped that the contest between myself
I and Mr. Dalton would be under the new
I law. from which we expected so much. I
j think, however, that the matter can be
j safely left to the party managers, and I
do not nee that th* situation In the fight
I between Mr. Dalton and myself has been
changed in the least."
"I do not think that the knocking nut
of the primary law will have any effect
upon my candidacy." said Assessor Henry
P Dalton. "My campaign has been well
organized, and we will go ahead just as
we would had the law been upheld."

Members of Camping Party
Meet With Serious
Accident.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, July 29.
Mrs. Arthur Hickox and Miss May
Palmer, both of Alameda, and Mrs. Per
rine and Miss Perrlne of San Francisco,
members of a large camping party from
Alameda, were seriously injured yester
day near the Bigelow ranch, on the Mc-
Cloud Klver, while being driven from the
ranch to the railroad depot to return
home. A wagon seat gave way. throwing
the four ladies backward and violently to
the road. Mrs. Hickox was so severely
hurt that her condition is critical. Miss
Palmer was less seriously 'affected, but
sustained a severe shock.
Both ladies were taken to the residence
of Mr. and Mrs. Louis Jacob!, at S15 Grand
street. Alameda, they arriving on the Ore
gon express this morning. Mrs. Hicko.x
is under the care of Dr. Reynolds. Mrs.
Perrine and her daughter were cared for
at a sawmill hospital near the scene of
the accident. Others in the party were
Mrs. Fred S. Teller, ex-United States Dis
trict Attorney Charles .Weller and Mrs.
Weller, Mllo Hickox and Mr. and Mrs.
Louis Jacobi.
The party left the ranch yesterday
morning In two wagons. The ladies who
were hurt occupied the rear seat of one
of the vehicles. While jogging along the
mountain road a wheel struck a rut and
the seat fastenings broke. The seat,
pitched backward, tumbling the occu
pants Into the road. The only assistance
at hand was five miles distant, and the
injured ladies, suffering intensely, had to
be hauled over the rough grades. The
overland train was held for them and
â¢Â¦very attention was shown them. Mrs.
Hickox, who it is feared Buffered spinal
injuries, was under the Influence of
opiates constantly as soon as medical at
tendance could be secured. It la not
known how badly Mrs. Perrine is hurt, aa
she and her daughter preferred to remain
behind until her condition could be more
definitely determined. .

PILOT CHIEF OVERWHELMED WITH OFFERS.
XV. | i
The period of the Kansas controversy }
gave rise to events full of serious por
tent for the Democratic party and, there- ]
fore, for the Union. One by one the bonds
between the slave and the free sections Â«
had- snapped under the Increasing strain. '
The ties of race and language and kin- ! ;
dred. the common interest in church or- j :
ganizations and business enterprises, and ;
the common love of country were gone,
and political attachments, too, were civ
ing way. There was no longer an Ameri
can party or a Whig party uniting North
and South: the new Republican party
was Inevitably a strictly sectional party. !
and the South regarded It with pro
nounced enmity. Only the Democratic
party remained, and Democrats who loved
the Union saw with foreboding threaten
ing signs of disruption there.
Effects of the Dred Scott Decision
Upon the Party.
The struggle which followed the pas
sage of the Kansas-Nebraska bill had
tended all along to strengthen the hold of
the advocates of slavery upon the Demo
cratic party, and the Dred Scott decision
completed the triumph of that faction.
There had been under Pierce a growing
ascendency of pro-slavery leaders, while
Buchanan's weak will and yielding char
acter were soon entirely dominated by
them.
The political importance of. the Dred
: Scott decision lay, as we have seen, in
cans rallied heartily to th* support of
Douglas he would no doubt have* become
President In 1S60, and it Is an interesting
speculation Just now that would have al
tered the sequence of events;
Abraham Lincoln became thÂ« K*jmDlÂ»
can candidate to contest Senatorial honors
with Douglas, and then occurred the great
debate up and down the State which
raa>le the campaign forever memorable.
Local questions played no part in the d!Â«
cuÂ«sion.- It was the mighty question
which was splitting the nation In two
which was debated In all its aspects by
the rival statesmen, while their audlenoe
was the whole people. Lincoln placed the
issue before the people upon high moral
grounds. He told them that a honsÂ« di
vided agsBnst itself could not stand; that
the nation could not continue to exi!Â«
half slave and half free. He exposed the
sophistry in the popular-sovereijrnty
theory of Douglas, while he also riddled
the argrument of the Dred Scott decision.
Douglas was the successful candidate,
but Lincoln, as he said, was "after largor
frame." What was the election of '5S *>
that of "60? Lincoln's eye was upon, tao
larger field of battle.
The debates, while they madÂ© Lracop
known to the whole country, grreatb'
strengthened the Republican party and
clarified the views of the various ele
ments composing it. They were thus o!
vast importance in party history.

NEW YORK. July 29.â Italians In
America who are acquainted with the
methods of the anarchist societies will
ever believe that Carbonl Sperandlo was
chosen to murder King Humbert and that,
concluding that he could not successfully
accomplish the mandate, he compromised
by killing PeppJno Pessina. who had made
himself obnoxious by opposing the teach
ings of the societies. After the killing of

into the hands of the police. Then, it Is
believed, another was chosen by the anar
chist? to fill the role of regicide.

Strange to say, the amazing prediction
that the memory of the assassin would be

HUMBERT'S DEATH
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
. 1118 Broadway, July 29.
The congregation of the First Presbyte
rian Church received and accepted with
great regret the resignation of Rev. Rob
ert F. Coyle, their pastor for the last ten
years. The resignation had already been
presented to the session of the church,
and at the close of the morning service
it was presented to the congregation. Dr.
Coyle read the following letter:
To the Members of the First Presbyterian
Church and Congregation of Oakland, Cal.â
My Dear Friends: You have already been made
acquainted with the fact of my resignation as
your pastor. The preliminary step was taken
by consent of the session last Wednesday night.
The decision was arrived at alter long and
prayerful deliberation and only because I be
lieve It to be Tny duty to myself and family.
It will be ten years on August 10 next since I
first btood In this pulpit Soon .after you were
cood enough to call me to the pastorate and I
was foolish enough to decline. But a little
later you renewed your call, and, believing it
to be the call of God, I came, entering upon
my work here February 1, 1S91.
Since then I have been with you In season and
out of season, putting all my strength of mind
and hear: and body into the work of this church.
With the history of its expansion you are all
familiar. For its remarkable growth I take
only my share of credit. Without your con
stant co-operation, your unity of spirit, your
patience, your willingness to be led. it would
have been. Impossible. No pastor ever had a
more loyal and considerate people. You have
been warm in appreciation, unfailing in kind
ness, most thoughtful in sympathy. My weak
nesses you have generously overlooked, and
whatever of worth there was In me you have
graciously magnified. From every vacation and
every period of absence I have come back to
you with glad anticipation, for I knew your love
and the welcome that awaited me and mine.
Wherever 1 go in the future I shall thank God
for every remembrance of you.
I shall go from you with genuine and pro
found sorrow. To thin church I am deeply and
permanently attached. Its officers, members
and x>eople are all my friends. If I have any
enemies In the congregation I do not know It.
fCo doubt I have made mistakes. Xo doubt I
have sometimes spoken unadvisedly with my
lips. Certainly I have fallen far short of my
own Ideals. But you will bear me witness that
I have not soared myself to increase the use
fulness and promote the interests of this church.
I have prayed for it, planned for It. labored
for it with unceasing earnestness Its welfare
has been my welfare, its prosperity my joy, its
growth my exceeding great reward. You will
also bear me witness that I have not shunned
to declare unto you all the counsel of Ood. I
have believed in the gospel, the undiluted,
evangelical gospel, and preached It to the best
of my ability. ;
To leave such a church and such a people
will not be easy. The pain of it will strike
deep, for I shall be leaving a part of myself,
but I am sure it Is best that I ehould go. Till
October 1st I shall be with you. In the mean
while I shall do all In my power to assist the
committee to secure a puceessor. It would
Klve me lasting satisfaction if I might have
the pleasure of Introducing him to you before I
leave. In the near future I ohall ask you to
Join with the session in a request to the presby
tery to dlFSolve the pastoral relations. And
now, brethren, I commend you to God and
to the word of His grace, which Is able to
build you up and cive you an Inheritance amor,?
all them that are sanctified. Faithfully yours.
ROBERT F. COYLE.
Oakland, Cal.. July 29. 1900.
At the close of the reading of this ad
dress W. A. Curtlss arose and presented
the following resolutions, Â¦which were
unanimously adopted by the congregation,
which thus finally accepted the resigna
tion:
Whereas, the Rev. Dr. R. T. Coyle, our be
loved pastor, did. on last Wednesday evening,
tender to the session of this church his resig
nation as pastor, with the earnest request that
it bÂ« accepted, and
Whereas, The session did very reluctantly and
with)-; many regrets accept such resignation, so
far aÂ« its Jurisdiction extends, and appointed a
committee to offer resolutions of esteem for and
confidence In our dear pastor and regrets that
he has seen fit to consider a call to another
field, therefore your committee, in fear that
such resignation may have to be accepted by
the church when the proper time may come,
offers the followtnz resolutions:
Resolved. By the members of this church and
congregation that no reason exists within this
church why the Rev. Dr. Coyle should sever
his relationship to us. but his contemplated
action 1b caused wholly, as he has stated, by a
feeling that he can do enlarged work for the
Master in an Eastern field, that should we have
to oart with our dear brother we shall do so
with great sorrow of heart.
Resolved, secondly. That we fully realize that
the Rev. Dr. Coyle has worked faithfully and
with marked and unprecedented success and
ability In this church to Its Ereat edification
and advancement during his pastorate of nine
and a half years, a small part of which may be
noted In the fact that the membership of the
church has increased from less than nine hun
dred to nearly fourteen hundred and the seat-
Ing capacity of the auditorium enlarged by
about four hundred seats, niaxing seat room
for sixteen hundred people, which Is often in
sufficient. .
Resolved, thirdly, that In the proposed re
moval of the Rev. Dr. Coyle this community
and the whole coast will suffer by losing from
our midst a man who has enlisted the esteem
for our Christian religion of many men who
are not directly connected with any church by
virtue of his manly and outspoken opinions on
all questions relating to the public welfare, his
warmest sympathies being always enlisted for
the advancement of civic righteousness, and
by his ever ready -defense of the rights of his
fellow-men.
Resolved, fourthly, that our prayers win go
out with him and his family Into whatever new
Held the Lord may call him that he may bÂ«
equally successful In his labors In such new
vineyard of the Iyird us he has been here
â¢ Resolved, fifthly, that we most heartily com
mend the Rev.. R. F. Coyle. P.D.. to the mem
bers of the church to which he shall go as an
able and faithful minister of the gospel, and
as one who steadily and continuously as well
as eloquently preaches Christ and Him crucified
as the only savior of mankind, and to such
church we can say truly, "Your gain is our
loss."
To our dear brother. Dr. Coyle, we say, "May
Ood be with you now and always: may his
presence comfort and sustain you and give you
great success In winning souls for his king
dom, and when the great harvest home feast
fhall be held may you come in Joy. bringing
your sheaves with you." For the congregation

The electric cars scored another point
yesterday morning in the game of maim
ing humanity^ This time the victim la
Abe Bernard, 2- years old, the son of
Jacob Bernard, a dealer In second-hand
furniture. The child, who was accom
panied by his. brother, Hyman. aged 6.
tried to toddle across the track near the
intersection of Kolsom and Sixth streets
and was struck by a car. The car did not
kill the mite, but the fender rolled the
tender little body over the pavement until
the brakes brought the vehicle to a stand
still; then the trucks were pried up until
the frantic father could draw his child
from between the wheels.
"What would have happened If the fend
er had performed the duty expected of it
Is hard to say. It might have killed the
baby outright and it might have saved
him without a scratch, for fenders, under
present conditions, are much like a lot

within a few feet, for- it had slowed up
for the crossing. When. the people rushed

the pavement with the hea*y iron scoop

The father of the child was coming up
the street when the accident happened,
and with others he ran out to the car
to see what was the matter. He recog

EXPELLED ARMY OFFICER
CRAZED BY ALCOHOL
Former Lieutenant Devine Makes a
Sensational Escape From the
Receiving Hospital.
Patrick II. Devine, an expelled army of
ficer, was taken from the Hamman baths
on Post street yesterday afternoon to the
Receiving Hospital, as he was suffering
from alcoholism. He had been at tho
baths for two days and had spent the time
in drinking whisky. He was placed in a
cot in the male ward and about an hour
later he made his escape by climbing over
the iron screen guarding the window close
to his cot.
Policeman J. Sullivan saw Devine with
nothing on but his trousers and shirt run
ning along Larkin street and several small
boys following him. Sullivan joined in the
chase and overtook the degraded officer
as he was trying to enter a house on Birch
avenue, near Polk street. He was taken
back to the hospital and locked up in -a
padded cell In the Insane ward.
Devine was a second lieutenant in the
Forty-seventh Infantry, but was dishon
orably discharged in Manila last April for
conduct unbecoming an officer. Since com
ing here he has been representing himself
as an officer on active duty and borrowing
money on that showing.. Last Tuesday
morning he appeared before Judge Mogan
on a charge of drunkenness and was al
lowed to go.

What promises to be a hard-fought legal
battle to secure possession of j the large
estate of the late Mrs. Almira S. Town
send will be commenced this morning.
Joseph Coburn, who claims to be the
brother of the deceased philanthropist,
will, through "his attorney, Hugo Asher,
go before Judge Bahrs of the Superior
Court and oppose the granting of regular
letters of administration to Mrs. Ella i>".
Murray, who will sÂ«ek to establish the
relationship of daughter to Mrs. Town
eend. Coburn will also- file a petition to
be appointed administrator of the dead
woman's estate.
Asher, supported by Attorney Short
ridge, will ask that a search be made for
a will in the Townsend home. Mrs. W. R.
Smith, who claims to know of a secret
hiding place, will be called upon to dis
close It.
Asher will contend for his client that
Mrs. Murray is not a bona tide resident oL
this State. The law requires that to ad
minister on an estate a petitioner must
be a resident.
Judge Sullivan, who is looking after the
interests of Mrs. Murray, is not very
much concerned over the point which will
be raised regarding his client's residence.
He asserts that Mrs. Murray came to this
city on July 9 to be near >ier mother,
whom she had not seen in mjiny years;
that it' was her intention' to' make her
home with her mother; that when her
mother died the large interests to which
the daughter would fall heir would cer
tainlv induce her to remain in this city
in order to guard her rights therein. No
body questions Mrs. Murray's identity or
relationship, according to Judge Sullivan,
and even those who are bitterly opposed
to her acknowledge that she was the dtad
woman's daughter.
"I desire to say," said Judge Sullivan
yesterday, "that the reason precautions
are being taken at the residence of the
dead woman is that we do not dtaire that
irresponsible persons shall gain, access
thereto. We believe that the boionginps
of Mrs. Townsend should be held sacred.
We are not hiding papers and. we do not
propose to destroy any evidence. If a will
be found it will certainly be presented In
court, but we do not wish to give any one
the opportunity to deposit a fraudulent
paper in what might be afterward said to
be a hidden panel. As far as we have
been able to discover there are no secret
hiding: places In the house. The one over
which so much talk was made was merely
a receptacle in the wall in which Mrs.
Townsend kept a dozen or more keys. It
was in plain view, but every one did not
have access to the room In which it was
located. We will not object to the ap
pointment of a trustworthy person, whose
duty it shall be to search Mrs. Townsend's
home for any papers that may have a
bearing on the case."
Samuel M. Shortridge, who has been ap
pointed^attornty for absent heirs, will join
in any proceeding which will tend toward
the discovery of the legitimate heirs to
the estate.

heirs," said Mr. Shortrid&e. "are not
clearly understood. It is the duty of such
counsel to assist the court in ferreting out,
as it were, those who should legally in
herit the estate of a dead person. He must
see to it that the proper party is selected
to administer on the estate; that no fraud
ulent practices are carried on. and that
the estate is ultimately distributed to tho
parties who are entitled to It. The State
of California may enter into the proceed
ings, as the estate might escheat to tho
State. Then there is the inheritance tax,
which makes the people interested. It la
my duty to see that all interests which
are not otherwise represented shall have
their claims presented in a formal man
ner."

SAN FRANCISCO WILL
INVITE ODD FELLOWS
HIS Grace the Most Rev. P. "W.
Riordan. Archbishop of the Bee,
laid the cornerstone of St.
Boniface's new church on Golden
Gats avenue, near Leavenworth street,
yesterday afternoon. The ceremony,
which was of great solemnity, was per
formed in the presence of thousands of
people of all denominations 'and was most
Interesting. The Archbishop, clad in the
priestly robes of his high office and pre
ceded by acolytes and the clergy, marched
! in stately procession from the congrega
tion's present place of worship into the
new edifice. As the procession marched
along Golden Gate avenue through the
lines of eager sightseers the choir ren
dered the "Veni Creator." The procession
halted in the sanctuary of the new
church. The Archbishop then blessed the
cross with holy water and as the line
moved toward the cornerstone the rev
erend father blessed the walls of the now
rising edifice. With a silver trowel the
prelate spread the mortar over the stone,
which was held in position by a derrick,
and. as it was lowered into place appropri
ate prayers were delivered by the clergy
present. After this important ceremony the
Archbishop again moved around the build
ing and sprinkled holy water on the walls.
The prelate then ascended the platform
and, facing the large audience, delivered
a short address In which he congratulated
the congregation for the work it had un
dertaken and prayed that they complete
their splendid work. In part he said:
"I deem It my duty to say a word or
two to encourage members of the congre
gation for their zeal and generosity in
building up a great church for themselves
and their children. They required great
courage, my dear people, to undertake
so vast a work as this. When we remem
ber the small beginnings of a few years
ago and the amount of money expended
upon this parish In the purchase of prop- i
cornerstone: The name of the reigning
pontiff, Pope Leo XIII; the names of the
Archbishop of the diocese, his Grace the
Rev. P. w. Riordan; the pastor of St.
Boniface's Church, Rev. Maximilian
Neuman; the clergy of the household,
among them being Rev. Fathers Augus
tine, Philibert, James and Cornelius;
Brother Adrian, O. F. M., of St. Louis,
the architect; Brother Ildephons, the su
perintendent and inspector of construc
tion, and the visiting clerpry and coins of
the realm and sacred relics.
Archbishop Riordan was assisted In the
ceremonies by the following named cler
gymen of this city and vicinity:

erty and the enlargement of the old
church it Is surprising that you can be
gin building a church which will entail
great sacrifices on your part. The parish
has grown to such a large extent that this
building is needed for the accommodation
of the .people. The children in the schools
have increased so largely that the older
buildings and this magnificent school
house which is before us are necessary to
house them.
"You have my heartfelt congratulations
for what you have done in the past and
what you purpose continuing to do. I am
sure there are Catholics in this city who
will lend a helping hand to the good work
and bring it to a successful issue. There
is no such thing as a German Catholic
church.an Irish Catholiochurch or an Ital
ian Catholic church. We are all members
of a great faith; we are members of a
great army and belong to His fold; we are
all brothers and sisters of a great saving
faith. I am sure they will not be back
ward in coming to this congregatlon'.s as
sistance. I hope God will bless what we
have done to-day and bring it to a suc
cessful issue and that we may have the
privilege of dedicating this house of wor
ship to the service of our Lord."
The speaker introduced Rev. Father
Maximilian Neuman, O. F, M., the pas
tor of the church, who addressed the as
semblage in German. He congratulated
the congregation on the beginning they
had made in the old church and lauded
the former pastors, who are now deceased.
He spoke in high praise of Father Gerard,
first of the Franciscan Fathers in St.
Boniface's pariah. He dwelt at length
on the good will shown by the congrega
tion in proposing the building of a new
church and the helping hand they had
lent. He exhorted them to continue and
spoke of the spirit of faith, good will and
charity that should reign in the parish.
In concluding his address the speaker
asked the blessings of God on the good
work and prayed that He would lend his
aid in completing the house Of worship
The singing of the "Te Deum" by the
choir and the assembled congregation
completed the ceremonies.
The following relics were placed In the
IMPRESSIVE CEREMONY AT LAYING OF CORNERSTONE.
Christ, Instead of Seeking Angels,
Gave Ministry Into Hands of
Poor, Sinful Men of
Galilee.
Preaching from a text contained In St.
Paul's Epistle to the Epheslans, chapter
B. verses 19-22. the Rev. Father Peter C.
Torke delivered a powerful sermon on the
relation of the priest to the world at St.
James Church, Twenty-third and Guer
rero Etrects. yesterday morning. The
speaker claimed that the mission of the
priest is a mission of reconciliation, and
that to properly reach the hearts of those
he seeks to eavÂ© must above all things
be a man, and not a. mystic.
"Especially must the work of re
deeming souls be Individual," declared
Father Yorke. "You cannot save souls by
wholesale. It Is true that the apostles
wore Bent out to be fishers of men, but
they were told not to use a dragnet, but
a single line."
Bpeaklngr of the klr<* of men whom
Christ choÂ«Â© as his <3ieciples. Father
yorke said:
"He passed over those whom he might
have usedâ the ar.prels. lie passed over
th^sÂ© heayc-n!y beings tnat knew no sin
und came down to earth, sought among
the poor, fcinful men of Galilee and gave
his ministry into their hands. A priest of
tiod Ffcouid be as a man. He should know
the passions of a sinful man. When a
man comes to console a fellow human be
ing if he has not known 6orrow and pain
l:irr.*Â«-lf you know how hollow and me
chanical his gTief sounds. But let one
who has felt suffering visit you on an
errand of consolation, and then what a
tiifference.
"Bo when our IjOtQ. sent out apostles he
eent out men who could speak 10 the sons
of Adam and whom the sons of Adam
would understand. The object of the apos
tles was to bring the ministry of reconcil
iation home to every man; to make every
rr.an understand that hf could not deal
with God direct, but with his agents. All
the .ijiosiles disappeared; some died by
the sword, eome under cruel torture, some
were driven afar by persecution, seme
were torn to ehreds by the fangs of wild
beasts: but the apostolic college has en
dured and endures. The sound of its voice
%vÂ«nt out to the ends of the earth bo that
these who listened to it were no longer
like children tossed to and fro by every
wind of doctrine, but they enjoyed com
fort and 3 i^ace under the swell of its mu
fic. We priests may sometimes falter,
sometimes be weak, though we are minis
\(T* of reconciliction. "We, the shepherds,
want to pro with you. the sheep, to the
preen pasture? of eternity, where there
will be no more pain, sorrow or suffering,
er.d where The srr*at shepherd ehall wipe
ell tears frrÂ«n all eyes."
In a Foraeful Sermon the
Prelate Describes His
Ideal Minister.
PRIESTS SHOULD
BE HUMAN, SAYS
FATHER YORKE
The announcement in yesterday's Call
of the appointment of Bishop Montgomery
to be coadjutor to Archbishop Riordan
was much discussed by Catholics yester
day. An inkling of the appointment had
become current in the diocese, but the
news of it came as a great surprise to all
but a few.
Bishop Montgomery's popularity Is so
great in San Francisco that both in the
church and out of it expressions of
pleasure are heard that the Archbishop *6
to. have the aid of so able a coadjutor in
his great work. The Archbishop made
no direct reference to the appointment in
his sermon at solemn high mass at the
Cathedral yesterday morning at 11 o'clock.
The Cathedral was crowded with people
anxious for a iirst sight of his Grace and
eager to hear his iirst sermon alter his
return from Rome.
Kev. \. Ik Hannigan celebrated mass.
Rev. C. A. Ramm was deacon and Rev.
K P. Dempsey sub-deacon. Rev. P. h..
Mulligan was master of ceremonies. Una
Arcnuisnop occupied the tnrone with Rev.
joaeuh P. Meyaiuae and Kev. P. O Ryan.
The Very Rev. J. J. Prendergast, vicar
general was assistant priest.
By way of introduction to his sermon,
the Archbishop spoke of his pleasure U
being once more with his people. He
continued:
"I need not say to you that I am very
glad to flnd myself once more In the city
where my work is laid and with the people
of my diocese. I ask you to join with me
in returning thanks to Almighty God that
he has permitted me to return in some
what better health than when I went
away. 1 want to thank you for the wel
come you have given me and lor your
prayers while I was abroad.
"1 thank God that, while I am not so
strong as I was twenty years ago, I am
still well enough to do my work wltnout
asking for an assistant." .
The scriptural lesson was the parable oÂ£
the unjust steward, St. Luke xvl:l-9. The
Archbishop spoke In part as follows on
â¢'There is an air of the nineteenth cen
tury about this parable, though It was
spoken in the first. Human nature is
much the same In any century. The rich
man had a steward who was faithless to
his trust and squandered his master s
money. Word came to the master that
his agent was dishonest and he demanded
an account of his stewardship.
"The steward prepared to give up his
position by reducing the rents of his mas
ter's debtors, so that they would "S^i!
him into their houses when he should be
put out of the stewardship.
''Our Lord said, 'The children of this
world are wiser in their generation than
the children of light.' Our blessed Lord
does not approve of the steward s dishon
esty, but he praises his ingenuity, his
foresight. We can make an abstraction or
a single good quality of a man's character
and praise It, though condemning the
character as a whole. It has been said
that the evil one himself deserves some
credit for his perseverance.
"So the steward was wise In maKing
friends. Our Lord carries the lesson out
into the higher life and says, 'Make to
vourselves friends of the mammon of un
righteousness; that, when ye fail, they
may receive you into everlasting habita
tions.' Make friends of these things you
have about you, that they may help you
to everlasting life, y
"There is a class of people who pay no
attention to the future Jlfe. They live en
tirely for this life and In this life, and are
to engrossed in its affairs that they have
no thought for the future existence. An
other class of people do look into the
future and are careless of the things of
to-day. A third class cf men try to com
bine the two and have half a heart for
each.
"Those who give thought to the future
have a great lesson to learn from the
first class. What they do they do well.
They give their whole time and thought
to affairs. They have diligence and per
severance, which need only be brought to
a higher sphere. They are to be con
demned only for failing to see how the
routine of dally affairs can have a bear
ins on the eternal life. Too many preach
ers dwell upon the worthlessness of all
things human. Every duty well per
formed leads to God.
"The Lord contrasts the half-hearted
ness of the third class with the energy
of the first. "We have our profession and
we should try to live up to It. No man
can live up to all his profession, for the
Christian Ideal Is so high that It can at
tain Its perfect realization only In heaven.
"Look about you and see the Indiffer
ence that makes religion an affair of one
day In the week. Compare It with the
enerery of those who consider the thing's
of this world only. "We can't do much
for God If we wait to do something great
and heroic. We will not be called upon to
give our lives for him. Life Is made up
of little things. They are the weapons
of eternity.
"Do not look about with discontent upon
other people's better fortune. Let us faea
our duties and accept our position wfth
cheerfulness and thankfulness to God.
with calm hearts doing the little thinsrs
that will lead us to the life that will
not pass away."
At the cl^se of the mass the Archbishop
trave the Papal benediction and the "Tf
Deum" was sung by the choir In honor of
his eafe return.
