garding, the military moves, the: preparations for
further shipments. of troopg to China will be officially withheld,
so as. not to betray the plan of campaign to China, including
the Chinese diplomatists In Europe. As a result, reports are
very contradictory. However, a number of facts go- to show
that Germany* is preparing further large shipments.

The Field Marshal then showed the correspondent a tropical

wore In Palestine.
BERLIN, Aug. 10.â This evening the correspondent of the
Associated .Press had another interview with Count von
Waldersee, who, although 69, looks much. younger. His
step is vigorous and springy. His hair is closely cropped
and "an iron gray mustache contrasts with a ruddy com
plexion. Evidently, he is undertaking his important task in
China with spirit and energy. He expressed regret at being
unable to talk freely about his campaign plans, but said:
"I am busy making preparations for my departure and
have been conferring at length with the Minister of War and
with Count von Schlteffen. chief ofUhe General Stan*. A list
of the officers comprising my China staff was submitted to Em
peror William, who approved it. Some thirty German officers
will accompany me. General von.Schatrzkopf will be my chief
of staff and Colonel Barongay will be chief quartermaster.
The others are Baron Knigge and Count Koenigsmark as
aids and Count Wernigcrode.
"Yielding to potent reasons, I gave up the idea of going
to China by way of San Francisco. I shall start from Genoa
on August 20, sailing by the Sachsen, and expect to arrive at
Shanghai on September 22. There Lshall establish preliminary
headquarters .and complete my staff from the contingents of
the other powers. One reason for this ; change Is that I ; can
be better reached by telegraph while on the way. To-morrow

Neither did I say, or Intimate, that In my

ments attributed : to me" are absolutely In
correct." " -'
The defense of Chinese Christians by foreign guards, the fact that foreign
en* shared their food with them rather than drive them out to death, and final
ly the humane declaration of Minister Conger that they cannot be abandoned to
certain massacre, have struck a responsive chord in the breasts of the officials
here. It is asserted that if thÂ© foreigners are saved, the Chinese Christians will
leave Poking with them. Authority for the United States. and other powers to
take Fuch action is found by the officials in article 29 of the treaty of 1S5S be
tween China and the United States, and it is understood that similar articles,
in some cases stronger in language", are included In the treaties between China
and the European Governments. This is Article XXIX of the American treaty:
' "The principles of the Christian religion, as professed by the Protestant and
Roman Catholic churches, are recognized as teaching men to do good and to do
'to others as they would have others do to them.' Hereafter those who quietly
profess and teach these doctrines shall not bo 'harassed or persecuted on ac
count of their faith.'. Any persons, whether citizens of the United ; States . or
China, who according to these tenets teach and practice the principles of
Christianity, shall in no case be Interfered with or molested."
PROTECTION OF CHINESE CHRISTIANS.
It is apparent to the authorities that China is endeavoring to meet the
wishes of the powers, and an indication of this satisfactory policy Is the deliv
ery by Minister Wu to-day of the dispatch from Mr. Conger and the action of
the Chinese Government in permitting the cable of the Conger message received
two days ago. It is \he presumption of the offldals that the Chinese Govern
ment will comply with the demand that the rifle fire stop, and protect the Min
isters in Peking, as Bet forth in the memorandum handed to Minister "Wu'on
Wednesday night. It was learned to-day that Japan had formally approved the
contents of the note delivered to Minister Wu, and the approval of the other
powers is expected to be communicated within the next few days. ,
It is evident that the escort that will be sent to receive the legation officials
and those under their protection should consist of a large force. Minister Con
ger states that the escort must be sufficient "to safely guard 800 foreigners,
including 200 women and children, and 3000 native Christians who cannot be
abandoned to certain massacre."
MILITARY ESCORT MUST BE L0RGE ONE.
The authorities are now considering only the relief of the Ministers, and
the method by which this is to be brought about was the subject of a consulta
tion to-day by Secretary Root with the President. The first action determined
upon was to cable Minister Conger approving his purpose of remaining In Pe
king, Informing him that neither the United States nor any other Government
had asked China to direct its Minister to leave Peking, directing him to remain
barricaded in the legation until further instructions and Informing him of the
advance of the relieving column.
It Is expected that when the allied troops have got within a reasonable dis
tance of Peking, arrangements will be made between the military commanders
ead the Chinese authorities for the delivery of the foreigners to the foreign
escort. This escort must not be attacked. Should it be, the allies will Im
mediately resume their advance. It would not be surprising should this plan be
already a subject of discussion among the powers, though it is denied that
such la the case. When the Ministers are safe the President will probably take
under consideration the question of stopping the advance of the allies on Peking,
which the Chinese Government Is anxious to bring about. As Minister Conger
doea not mention the fact, it is presumed by officials that the rifle fire by the
Imperial troops upon the besieged is not causing them any apprehension, and it
Is possible that It may have ceased. ,
CONSIDERING ONLY RELIEF Of MINISTERS.
CALL BUREAU. WELLINGTON HOTEL. WASHINGTON. Aug. 10.âMin
ister Conner was directed to-day to remain barricaded in the British lega
tion in Peking ur.til further Instructions are sent by this Government.
The diplomatic representatives of other Governments will, It Is expected,
be cabled similar instructions. In this way the powers will checkmate
the crafty move of the Imperis.1 Government to induce the Ministers to leave
Peking on the ground that their Governments have been asking why they do
not start for the coast Though Minister Conger in his dispatch asserts that
the Tsung li Yamen states to the diplomatic body that various foreign Govern
ments have repeatedly a^ked through respective Chinese Ministers "that we Im
mediately depart from Peking- under suitable escort," the department is satis
fied Minister Wu made no sucli representation to his Government and that the
object of the lie told the diplomatic corps was to get them away from the forti
fied position they occupied, so they would be at the mercy of the Boxers and
imperial troops. OSirials are convinced of the duplicity of the Chinese Govern
ment from previous <M?patchr-s received from Minister Conger and other sources.
The dispatch to-day is Identical with that sent other Governments and shows
conclusively the lengths to which the Tsung li Yamen has gone to induce the
Ministers to pL-ico themselves in the power of the Chinese, and warm com
mendation I? gfoen Minister Conger and his colleagues for their ehrewdness In
declining to accept the statements of th? Tsung li Yamen unsupported by cipher
Instructions from their respective Governments. China will be held heavily to
account for her atumpts to lure the Ministers to their death by misrepresenta
tion, and it is un^rstood that the dispatch of to-day will be the subject of
another and vigorous representation to the Chinese Government when the de
mand made ten days ago is answered.
Special Dispatch, to The Call.
United States Instructs Its Minister to Re
main at His Post in the Chinese
Capital, and Other Powers Are Ex
pected to at Once Follow Suit.
SIMULTANEOUSLY with the improve
ment in what may be termed the Chinese
situation proper, points of ill-omen appear
in the international horizon. China is suing or is
about to sue for peace. Li Hung Chang has been
invested with plenary powers to' that end. The co
operation of the imperial authorities with the al
lies to the extent at least of handing over the refu
gees to an inadequate force as an escort in the
neighborhood of Peking is expected in many
quarters. In a word, the Chinese sky is just now
more serene than for many long days past.
At this juncture comes a dispatch from Shang
hai indicating that while the Chinese Government
is fain to admit its inability to fight the outer
world as a whole, it has not forgotten the advan
tages to be obtained by dividing the powers, and
is seeking to secure Russian support, while even
more menacing to international cohesion is the re
port of the intention of Admiral Seymour to land
British troops at Shanghai.
With one power taking measures of this kind
in its own particular sphere of influence, the others
would be likely to follow suit, and the Washing
ton administration consequently views the outlook
with some measure of alarm. Hitherto the note
of the powers dealing with China has been given
by the United States. With developments such
as are feared from the reported decision of Ad
miral Seymour, the Washington Government
could, in view of its declared policy, have nothing
to do.

PERSONAGE. OR IN A CHAIR CARRIED BY. PORTERS. AS SHOWN IN THE ABOVE PICTURE.
LONDON, Aug. 11,4 a-ni. â The morning
papers express satisfaction at latest develop
ments in China. The average comment is
that China is now genuinely suing for peace
through Li Hung Chang. Dispatches printed
this morning give further details of the taking of
Yangtsun. According to the Daily Mail's corre
spondent the attack was led by the Americans and
British. The Chinese position consisted of seven
lines of intrenchments. The enemy fell back un
til driven to the last line, when they fled to Peking
completely demoralized. The Chinese say they
retreated because the British "poured poison"
into their troops. This refers to the lyddite shells,
which the Chinese then experienced for the first
time.
The correspondent adds that the British casu
i alties were 200 and the Americans 250, but this
! latter estimate, - it will be noticed, is four times
greater than that of General Chaffee's report.
A St. Petersburg special says the Chinese Min
ister there, Yang Yu, has received a telegram an
nouncing that Li Hung Chang is dangerously ill
and confined to his bed, and that he has been
granted a month's leave.
Another St. Petersburg dispatch asserts that
the Russian general staff has been notified that
the Chinese 12,000 strong are moving from Hu
nan and Hupei toward Peking and Tientsin.
The Shanghai correspondent of the Daily
News, wiring Thursday, announces that the Chi
nese merchants are petitioning the authorities not
to land troops.
Conger and Other Ministers at Peking Send
Additional Reports of the Attempt of the
Chinese to Send the Diplomats Forth to

WASHINGTON, Aug. .10.â The Department of State made public this morn-
Ing the following telegram from Minister Conger, which was received
by Minister \Vu late last night, being contained In a telegram sent to
him by the Taotai of Shanghai. It was handed by Minister Wu to tha
Acting Secretary of State at 3 o'clock this morning:
Secretary of State, Washington: The Taung Li Yamen states to the dlplcmatic body
that the various foreign Governments have rereatetlly asked, through thÂ« respective Chlnens

such instructions we cannot quit our post. I must Inform you that in order to insure our
safe departure, foreign troops only can safely escort us. and they must be in suf Sclent
force to safely guard 800 foreigners. Including 200 wcmÂ«n and children, as wsll as 3CO0
native Christians, who cannct be abandoned to certain massacre. We cannot accept a
Chinese escort under any circumstances. All my colleagues are dispatching the foregoing
to their respective Governments. Of the American marines seven have been killer! and six
teen wounded, amonc the latter Captain Myers and Dr. LJppett. who are getting along
well. |U| CU.NGER.
This message is undated, but is supposed to have been sent on or after tho
5th of August, when \he Imperial edict removing the Inhibition against the
Ministers sending cipher messages was received by the Tsung 11 Yamen. It sub
stantially accords with the dispatch of the French Minister. M. Pichon, to his
Government, which was made public in Paris yesterday.
LONDON. Aug. 10,â The British Foreign Office has received from thÂ© Minis
ter. Sir Claude Macdonald, a dispatch, dated Peking. August 4, much to the
same effect as the dispatch received yesterday by tne French Foreign Office from
M. Pichon, the Minister of France, at the Chinese capital, which described the
efforts of the Chinese to Induce the foreign Ministers to accept a Chinese escort
to Tientsin.
BRUSSELS. Aug. 10.â The Foreign Office has also received from the Belgian
Minister at Peking a dispatch Identical with that received yesterday by the
French Office, from the French Minister at Peking. M. Plchon, telling of the at
tempts made by the Chinese to secure the foreign Ministers' acceptance of a
Chinese escort to Tientsin.

WASHINGTON, Aug. lO.-An Italian,
who gave his name as "Professor" Flguc

citement at the White House to-day by
exhibiting a brass projectile which he
Wished to present to the -President. He

He took out of the satchel a very heavy
projectile and a long wire and explained
that the pushing of the wire through a
hole which had been bored in the end of
the projectile's nose would caustf a big
explosion. The visitor could speak no

MESSENGER KILLED
AND SAFE ROBBED
NEPTUNE ASHORE
ON THE BEACH
BELOW THE PARK
Schooner, It Is Believed,
Will Be a Total
JuOSS.
The Wind Failed Her as She Was
Running Out, and the Current
Carried Her to Pestruc
tion.
Borne in on a cross current of the flood
tide, the Fchooner Neptune went ashore
last evening on the beach about two miles
and a half below the South Side Life Sav-
I Ing Station. There was not a breath of
I wind stirring; the moon was shining
! brightly and the cliffs of the shore could
j be plainly Feen for hours before she struck.
j Yet with two anchors dragging through
j the sand she got into the breakers, and
j now, "stern to," she is digging herself
into the beach. It is not believed she can
j be cot off.
Her crew and captain are safa. The
crew never left the ship, for she lies as
! steady as a rock in the surf, and the cap
! tain left her only to telephone in for a
I tug In order that all possible may be
; done to save her.
The Neptune left port yesterday at 12.
I She was bound In ballast for Houda under
j Captain Conrad Johnson. As she went
j out through the heads the wind failed her
I and she commenced to drift to the south
| ward. A strong flood tide was running
i and in one of the cross currents that it
! makes down the fteach below the Cliff
J House the luckless schooner was caught.
â¢ She drifted about all the afternoon and
i at dusk was well down the beach. Her
i captain was not anxious about her until
i the cliffs below the life-saving station
j carn<? abeam. Then he tried to come about,
i There was not wind enough to bring the
vessel out. however, and she only -wal
lowed In the swells, getting nearer and
nearer to the shore every Seeing
j that the position of his vessel was grow
ing serious. Captain Johnson let go one
j anchor, and then iflie other. held
! for a few minutes and then they eom
! menced to drag through the soft bottom.
j Then as a last resort Johnson ordered
out the small boat and , he tried to get
out the kedge, bring it out beyond the
suction of the roller?, which were then
close aboard, and after dropping it warp
the vej=5<jl out from the shore.
The rollers were too near, however, and
they caught .the small boat and. capsized
her. Johnson and the two men with him
struggled in the surf until the men on the
schooner could throw lines to them, and
by the time they got aboard again the
schooner waÂ» upon the beach and working
farther in chore with every wave that
ran past hÂ«T.
i She struck stern first, but soon the rol
â¢ lers turned her broadside to and in that
J position she is settling fast Into the sand.
While she was still outside the breakers
the lookout on the hill near the South
Side Life-saving Station, saw. her, and.be
fore she struck the lifeboat under Captain
Smith was bearing down on her. They
came alongside and Captain Johnson
came ashore to send for assistance. Them
wai no danger to any one and the crew
did not leave the vessel.' Then, some
time later. Captain Varney. with the life
saving crew from the Golden Gate Sta
tion at Bakers Beach, came along In a
wagon. They had been telephoned to
from the South Side Station and came to
offer assistance. There was not much to
do, however, for the schooner was hard
and fast, but not leaking, and there was
no danger. In fact at low tide, about
11:30 o'clock, she could be reached by a
man wading out through the waves.
The tug A'.ert was sent at once to her
assistance, but she could do nothing; nor
can anything be done until the high tide
this evening. Then an effort will be made
to get her off, hut Captain Smith and
Captain Varney, the life sa\"ers, say it is
doubtful if she will ever leave the bed she
is making fcr herself.
The Neptune is a schooner of 184 tons
gross, built in Kureka eighteen years ago
and owned by Sudden & Christenson, of 22
Market street, In this city. She has been
in the coast trade since she was built.
She was to load shingles at Houda, near
Humboldt Bay, for Newport, on the south
ern coast. She is valued at $6000, and but
recently ehe was on the drydock, where
she was repaired to the extent of $1000.
The place where the Neptune went
ashore Is a particularly dangerous bit of
beach, especially in the kind of weather
and under the conditions that existed wiicn
the schooner loft port.* There is a 'reef
running out from the beach which the
schooner escaped, but the flood tide makes
an eddy there that is sure to bring a
vessel in shore if there be no wind, and
the fact is proved that it sets in strong
enough to drag two anchors.
On July 4, 18S7, the schooner John Fred
erick went ashore at almost the exact
spot where the Neptune* now lies. The
"Frederick was a total loss. And two and
a half years ago the ship Enoch Talbot,
under similar conditions, was driven in
side the reef by the current, but a timely
breeze saved her.

GEORGETOWN. Ky., Aug. 10.â Mrs.
John Davis, the wife of one of the de
fendants charged with being an accessory
to. the Goebel assassination, was the first
witness introduced by the defense in the
Powers trial to-day. Powers boarded at
her house. John Powers was also there
on January 25. She testified that the lat
ter was ill in his room at her house that
day, and did not leave his room after 11
o'clock. This was In contradiction of the
testimony of Robert Noakes, who told
of an alleged conversation with . John
Powers at the State House, in which, he
said, the latter told him to "stay close to
the building, as something was going to
happen as ' soon as Goebel and those fel
lows came down."
Solomon Wilder of Whltely County
testified that Robert Noakes was at Cor
bln in March and asked him not to tell
anybody he was In town, as he might be
arrested in connection 'with the assassin
ation conspiracy.
On cross-examination it developed that
Wilder went to Frankfort in December
with Noakes and the other armed moun
tain men at the time of the meeting of the
State Election Commissioners. Noakes
gave him and the other men their trans
portation. He did not go. to Frankfort
with the two tralnloads of mountaineers
in which Noakes and hjs company, went
January 25, but heard them when they re
turned. Witness said they were drunk
and firing their guns promiscuously

Noakes' company the names or a num
ber of members of the company. y\ltnes3

had been tried, making the charge in sev

On direct examination Wilder testified
that John L. Jones of the Noakes Com
pany w?.s a- man of good character.. On
cross-examination he said Jones had
twice been convicted of murder and sen
tenced in each case to life imprisonment,
but was pardoned.
The defense then asked to be allowed
to offer as evidence the act of the Legis
lature appropriating $100,000 i for the pur
pose of aiding in the search for and prose
cution of the assassins of William Goebel.
The prosecution offered no objection, and
the act was made a part of the testimony.
Walter Day, former; Republican State
Treasurer, testified that Youtsey sent for
him the day before the shooting. He went
to ; see Youtsev, and the latter told him
that for $300 he would settle the contest.
Witness pressed Youtsey to know how ha
would accomplish It. but the latter- would
only say that for that amount, he would
- Witness said to Youtsey. "I am not that
kind of a man," and refused to confer
longer with Youtsey about It. Â¦
On cross-examination a letter' written
by Day to Secretary of State Hill was
produced. The defense objected, to It be
ing introduced and the jury. was excluded
during - argument. In the, .letter Day
states: . ' :"
"I will make a good witness for the
commonwealth and I want you; to go see
thÂ« prosecuting attorney. Franklin, and

LOrREXZO MARQUES. Aug. 31.â It
is persistently rumored here that
former President Steyn of the Orange
Free State has committed suicide.
LONDON. Aug. 11.â According to the
Lourenzo Marques correspondent of the
Daily Express, President Kruger, in the
course of an interview last Wednesday,
said that the report that he intended to
s-urrender was without foundation. He
declared that the war would last a long
time yet.
A Boer bulletin, continued the corre- |
epondent, announces a big battle between j
Lydenburg and Middleburg, in which the <
British had 500 killed and wounded, it also
announces the recapture by the burghers
of Heilbron, Devillierdorp and Frankfort.
Boer reports, by way of Lourenzo Mar-
ques, lately have proved worthy of little
credence.
A special dispatch from Pretoria says
the Boer plot to make a prisoner of Lord
Roberts and shoot all the British officers
possible, discovered Thursday, included
the recapture of Pretoria and the shooting
of Lord Roberts and to induce the burgh
ers to rise en masse. A number of sus
pected accomplices of the conspirators
have been conducted across the border.
The British authorities are to
the danger of allowing Boer Â¦sympathizers
to remain in Pretoria and the issue of
passes to the burghers has been stopped.

NEW SENSATION
SPRUNG IN THE
GAYNOR CASE
Important Testimony Givpn
by Captain Carter's
Father-in- Law.
Was Asked to Swear That He Was
Furnishing Money to the Officer,
but Refused to
â¢
NEWY6RK, Aug. 10.â The hearing to
secure the removal of John F. Gaynor, W.
T. Gaynor, T. H. Gaynor and Benjamin
D. Greene, accused of conspiracy to de
fraud the Government, to the jurisdiction
of the Georgia courts, was continued.be
fore United States Commissioner Shields
to-day.
Mr. Kellogg of counsel for the defend-;
ants announced that he had produced, as
called .upon, a book of the minutes of the
meetings of the Atlantic Contracting
Company for 1891 and 1S92.
J.' \V. O.Sterly, chief clerk of the engi
neer's, office at Savannah, was the first
witness questioned by United States Dis
trict Attorney Erwin of Georgia. He said
he had seen ex-Captain O. M. Carter on
August 15, 18K), at the University Club in
this city and there conferred with him as
to specifications for certain work to be
done at Savannah. He was cross-exam
ined and excused.
The prosecution then sprang a decided
surprise on counsel for the defendants by
calling to the witness stand Robert T.
Westcott, former Captain O. M. Carter s
father-in-law. During Captain Carter's
court-martial he claimed that many of
the bonds and securities in his possession
and which he hypothecated for various
sums of money had been placed in his
hands by Westcott, and he also claimed
a power of attorney from his father-in
law. During the proceedings of the board
of inquiry'. Mr. Westcott went to Europe.
Mr. Kellogg of counsel said when West
cott was called: "We were not prepared
for this and lind ourselves much embar
rassed. We were prepared to cross-ex
amine Captain Gillett, but not Mr. Wept
cott."
Mr. Westcott, after being questioned on
preliminary points, said Benjamin D.
Greene met him at the Hoffman House
and handed him a package of bonds, ask
ing that he take care of them.
Would Not Perjure Himself.
"Carter told me about the board of in
quiry and that he expected to be arrest
ed," said Mr. Westcott, "and asked me if
I would receive these bonds from Greene.
I demurred, but he insisted, and I finally
assented. Greene met me at the Hoffman
House October 11, 1807, and gave me the
bonds. I deposited them with the New
York Safety Deposit Company."
The witness said Carter asked him to go
before the board of inquiry and testify
that the large amounts of money Carter
was spending were received from him.
"But I told him." safd Mr. Westcott.
"that I could not do thatâ that I could not
swear to a lie."
Mr. Kellogg's objection to answers made
by Westcott precipitated personalities
between counsel, in which Westcott asked
for protection:- 1
Commissioner Shields assured Westcott
he would. b6 protected as a witness ana j
the examination was resumed. It was
then brought out that previous to the s'es- |
sion of the board of inquiry both Cap- j
tain Carter and Benjamin D. Greene had â¢
gone to Westcott and asked him to take
the bonds and securities. This. was done,
according to the counsel for the prose*
cution, because It was known that Car
ter had money on deposit that he could
not well have made from his salary.
Consequently. Westcott was asked to be
come a member of the Atlantic co'ntract
ing company to account tor his having the.
bonds, and securities. -This he refused,
but he placed the bonds in Carter's
safe deposit vault, j Then powers of at
tornev were shown from Westcott. who
gave 'Carter entire control of all West
cott's business affairs. The bonds and
securities that were handed Westcott to
the amount of $450,000 never appeared in
the board of inquiry proceedings. West
cott identified the powers of attorney
given by him to Carter, and told in detail
of receiving the $450,000 worth of bonds
and securities from Carter and Greene.
Identifies Checks.
He also identified a number of check?
drawn by him in favor of Benjamin D.
Greene, aggregating in sums to the
amount of $49,000. Those sums he paid
at the request of Captain Carter, who
paid them back in various sums at dif
ferent times. Witness met Captain Car
ter in New York In September. ISM. by
rcquest, and Carter gave him $100,000 to
take care of until Carter returned from
Georgia. It was also brought out tftat
different men in Savannah have loans or
large amounts, the money for which pur
ported to come from Mr. Westcott. Mr.
Westcott knew nothing about these
checks for the amounts of -three of these
loans that were put in evidence to-day,
as follows: Bierne Gordon, $10,000; John
Lyons, $15,000, and T. W. Cunningham,
$10,000.
The contention of the. prosecution in
this matter is that the money advanced
on these loans was not Westcott's, but
belonged to Captain Carter. 1
Testimony was also given relative to a
partnership existing between Westcott
and Captain Carter four years ago, in
which both had built houses in Orange.,
N. J., and the prosecution contends that
half of the money for these contracts be
longed to Captain Carter.

STAMFORD. Conn.. Aug. 10.â Under
cover of darkness, with the tide at its
height, a curious appearing dark green
craft glided from a mysterious building
on "Ware Island and into the water <nL
Stamford harbor at half-past 10 o'clnc't
to-night. It was a submarine torpedo
boat, concerning which the utmost se
crecy has been observed during the fifteen
months of lta construction. J. C. Carter
who saya he comes from Xew York, has
had practical charge of the building of
the boat, and i3 believed to represent a
syndicate.
Extraordinary efforts have bfeu madÂ«
to keep the facts regarding: the craft from
leaking out and there has been an air nf
mystery surrounding the Island. A build
ing was constructed in which the boat
was built, which prevented any one in a
passing boat from catching a glimp3e of
what was going on. The workmen were
pledged to secrecy. Armed men with
savage-appearins dogs have patrolled the
shores of the inland and have success
fully Intimidated all who .showed any in
tention to land. It was not until last
week, when one end of the building was
torn down, that those who ventured near
the island were able to distinguish what
appeared to be a torpedo-boat. Some facts
regarding the boat were obtained from'
one of the men employed on the island
who lives in Stamford. In general ap
pearance the craft i3 like the Holland
submarine torpedo-boat. It is fifty feet
long and about eight feet beam. Its pro
pelling power is similar to Dr. Jackson'3
method, the water beins forced out of
the stern. It is equipped with tanks ca
pable of holding eight barrels of kerosene
oil. There are two powerful pumps,
worked by electricity. There Is an ar
rangement by which, as soon as the oil
is consumed, the tanks will be filled with
water, so as to keep the ballast the samp.
The submerging of the boat is controlled
by rudders on each side. She has s!da
keels, two bilge keels and three rudders.
There are two torpedo tubes projecting
from a conning tower just abov? the deck.
The boat Is built of yellow pinÂ© and la
sheathed with galvanized iron.
It had been arranged to launch the boat
last night, but the approach of several
men in a boat evidently alarmed those on
the Island, who fired several shots from
shore and ran to and fro excitedly. Sev
eral dogs also appeared and barked sav
agely, frightening away the would-be in
vestigators.

RUHLIN UNCONSCIOUS
FOR SEVERAL HOURS
Special rMspatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Aug. 11.â The Sun says:
Ruhlin. when taken to his dressing-room
after the fight last night, was in very bad
shape and almost immediately became un
consclous. A doctor in the building re
sponded to a hurry call and found the
case so serious that he administered
strychnine. Ice bags were also applied
to Ruhlin's head and he partially revived.
He was then removed to Evera'rd's baths.
He again,' collapsed on his arrival there,
and as all local means failed to restore
him to consciousness Dr. Guy D. Lembard
was hastily summoned.
The doctor arrived at, 12:45 o'clock and
after making a thorough examination
Â«ald he felt quite safe in saying the fighter
had sustained no internal injuries. He
added that the blow which Ruhlin 1 re
ceived When his head struck the stage at
the time of the knock-out, together with
the plexus blow and other severe body
punishment, had brought him to a state
of collapse, and no serious results arc
likely to occur, judging from his present
condition. While the physician was ex
amining him - Ruhlin â¢ opened his eyes and
faintly asked for water. This was given
him and he again lapsed into a sort of
stupor. . Blood' at this time was trickling
from his earsand nose. - . Â¦" . Â¦
Dr. Lembard said as a matter of pre
caution he would remain for a while.
All that I ask is that you all watch The
Call's bulletin board and see if my con
fidence is justified.
By the way, it may be worth while to
tell The Call readers that Fitzsimmons
called me over to him to-night and asked
me to shake hands. I shook. What else
could I do? Now. of course, you will want
to know something about my coming
match with Kid McCoy. I know that lots
of people, think McCoy is such a wonder
ful fancy boxer that he can whip a man
out of his class, and he needs to have
some of the conceit taken out of him. I
am confident that I am the better
boxer, and if anybody thinks my blows
arc not as heavy as they used to be,
why, just ask Jim Jeffries. I am not go
ing to make any rash promises.
Match With McCoy.
There he lay with his nose rubbing the
boards, and there he stayed till he was
carried to his corner. The crowd cheered
Fitz and hooted at poor Gus, who did
not mind, because he could not hear. He
was led from the ring to his dressing
room, where he lay on a table and was
sponged. He felt pretty badly when I
finally left him. He had nothing to say
and his jaw hung on his breast. I don't
imagine it was anything serious, though.
The hot weather and a good licking are
enough to make anybody feel bad, but I
wager you that Gus will come around all
right and if he has another go at the
Australian will lick him.
not hard to perform, for Ruhlin left his
face free for anybody to hit. He fell on
his knees as if his feet had been sud
denly knocked from under, and his fore
head hit the floor with a resounding
whack.
NEW YORK. At- 10,-If the fight
had been stronger my story would
be longer, but a short horse is soon
curried and it takes but six chap
ters to tell how Gus Ruhlin was
knocked out at Madison Square to-night
by Robert Fitzsimmons.
To begin with it was hotâ the weather, 1

mean. If I were pro
fane, I might say
just how hot it was
in that big amphi
theater, but I don't
want Frisco people
to think I have de
generated in morals
since I left the coast.
But really, it was
enough to make a
preacher swear. You
folks out there with
your glorious climate
cannot realize what
hot weather means.
You should have been in Madison Square
Garden to-night. This big hall accommo
dates over 15,000 people. Every seat was
taken and many persons were standing in
the aisles. The thermometer registered 95
degreesâ blood heat, Just think of itâ and
then the auditorium, as usual at fights,
was filled with tobacco smoke.
Now you put two great big men to work
exchanging blows without cassation, ex
cept very brief intervals between rounds,
and they can't last long in Huch intense
heat as this has been to-night.
Ruhlin's Poor Showing.
I noticed early in the fight that both
men were still panting hard whenever the
bell sounded time. This is the only way
I can account for to-night's slow fight.
I call it a slow fight, because both men
seemed loggy and had no steam in their
blows, yet the crow-1 seemed pleased. I
was surprised at Ruhlin. Why, that great
big strong duffer made no sort of show
ing at 'all. I still contend that he can
lick Fitzsimmons, but for some reason he
was not in condition to-night. I had not
seen him for three days until I; met him
to-night.
Three days ago I was at his training
quarters, and. honest, his living room was
not any bigger than a dog kennel. It
was close and stifling. The air was bad.
I said, "Gus, get out "of here 'or you'll
sweat all the steam out of you."
Well, he did not take my advice and
you see the result. He hit Fitzslmmons
repeatedly, but did not jar him. I saw
as early as the first round that he was
bound to be licked, so I said, "Stay away
from him all you can, Gus, and maybe
he will lick himself. Maybe you can
manage to hold out the limit." He took
my advice and tried to keep out of
harm's way, now and then getting in a
crack to two on Robert's face and body,
which did not phase the Kangaroo. Guj
seemed exhausted.
The Knockout Blow.
Fitzsimmons was not much better, but
in the sixth round he managed to send
in a good one to Ruhlin's jaw. The Ohio
giant made a wry face and seemed to
hesitate, yet it was plain that he was
dazed. Robert observed it, too, and his
little eyes gleamed wickedly as he saw
his chance. The crowd yelled, "Fitz,
Fitz, hook him, Fitz!" And Robert re
sponded by fetching Gus a good left hook
on the jaw. It was a crackajack, though

FIGHTERS HANDICAPPED
BY THE INTENSE HEAT
VICTOR AND VANQUISHED IN A RATTLING FIGHT.
NITW YORK. Aug. 10.â Bob Fltzsim
nons, ex-champion pugilist of the
â¢world, mrt Gus Ruhltn, the Akron
giant, to-nieht before the Twen
tieth Century Club at Madison
Square Garden and won by knocking the
Ohioan down and out In the sixth round.
Before the fight and for some weeks past
there have been many reports to the ef
fect that Fitzsiramor.s was too old to cope
Fucct-sslully with his younger opponent.
It was argurd that Fitzsimmons' well
known Imovlcdgt of ihe game rind his
capability for bard hitting would not be
r.blâ¬ to counterbalance the youth and
Et"Tgth, as well as the recently acquired
ring tactics, of the Ohio man. To-night,
however, all this has been changed. Fitz-
Flmmons did the trick cleanly and clev
erly. It was a fierce and bloody battlo
whil? It lasted tnd at times it looked as
If Ruhlm -would get tho better of the oth
er man, but Fitzsimmons at the proper
time cut loose with his fearful body blows
which finally snuffed out the Ohio box
er's light.
The bettir.g all along had favored Fitz
fecmmons, many wagers at the rate of 100
to 60 on Lanky Bob belnpr made. To
night, however, at the ringside there was
e flush of Ruhlin money, which forced
the odds to take a turn in Ruhlin's favor
at the rate of 100 to 90. This state of af
fairs did rot last long, however, and by
the tlrce the men put up their hands for
the opening round they were equal favor
ites.
Fierce Frora the Start.
3Icn Tire Early.
Fitzsimmons himself conceded about
thirty-two pounds to Ruhlin, and this In
itself was a serious handicap. Bui as the
result fhowed. Fitzsiimnons was equal to
the tas-it he hal set himself, and won out
w:t'.i that terrible solar plexus blow,
â¢a-h'ch. whenever it landed, shook Ruhlin
from head to foot. From the word "go"
the men started in with hurricane-like
force. Beth were â¢wild at times, but Fitz-
Fimmor.s was always the quicker to
fctecdy himself. Ruhlin clinched a good
deal "and for three or four rounds was
the aggressor. He landed some hard
Ftralght lefts on FitzEimmons" face and
pwur.K his rlsht t" the body and hfad
with ffarful fore-. Several cf these blows
FTappeied Fitzsirnmons, but none of them
landed on th* mark, as Fitzsimmons was
too shifty. At timfp both missed swings
with either hand, but many of Ruhlm'a
were dodged in the cleverest manner.
FitzÂ»:rr.mons forced Ruhlin to break
prour.d. and in hot mix-up* the Ohio man
was always the flr.n to ease up and take
r^fugf* in a clinch. Time and again Fitz-
Elmmoi? forced R"hlir. to the ropes, from
which position Ruhlin got away rather
clumsily. *rh!te F;tzs=5mm<-.r>s was always
very quick in his foot movements. When
Ruhlin's nosf began to bleed from a left
punch the Fisht of the blood seemed to
havÂ«Â» a deterrent effect on him and Fitz-
Eimrrioiis wan quirk to see this. On the
first s!*-'r.s of weakness on Ruhlin's part
Fitzsirrmons began his attack on the
body ar.d each blow which he landed there
made Gus wince with pain. FUzsimmons*
handlers kept urgir.p nim to play for the
solar plexus, but Fitzsimmor.s only tried
it occasionally. Evidently he was await
ing an opportunity for a right swing to
the mark. In the fourth and fifth rounds
both men shoved plainly the effects of
the stiff and rapid work they had done in
the preceding iounds.
Both were tired and leg-weary . but Ruh
lin showed uo much the worse of the two.
Fitzfimmons was always the quicker on
his feet at the call of time, but now and
th**R during the rounds he seemed to
f tend Ftill and glare at his opponent. Ruh
lin at thes=e times also stood still, bein^
evidently grateful for the chance of
breathing which Fitzsimmons afforded
him. Just once Fitzsimmons touched the
floor, when he flipped down from a clinch
at the end of a round. In the sixth round
rtuhiin was flow in coming to time, while
Fitzsimmons Jumped at his man. Fitz-
Flmmons got around Ruhlin, and while
the latter sent straight lefts for Fitzsim
mons' head Bob sidestepped safely and
landed lefts on the body and a right to the
head With a volley of lefts and rights
to the head and neck and with a fearful
left on the solar plexus Fitzsimmons sent
Ruhlin in a heap to the floor.
Ruhlin Goes Out.
Not a "Eas Bsen."
This was the beginning of the end that
soon followed. Ruhlin. after taking nlno
seconds o; the count, arose to his feet
croppy from the effects of the blow. 1 Itz
fimmons knew he had his man. and was
r^ady for him. As soon as Ruhlin pot up
Fitzsimmons rushed, sending two lefts to
the face and then shot his right with fear
ful force to the point of RuhMn 8 Jaw.
Gus pitched forward as If struck with an
ex and fell on his face to the floor, where
he was counted out and had to be carried
tr. his corner. , ; ... .
Wild scenes were then enacted in and
cbout the ring. It seemed as if every one
ir. the building wanted to greet the w-n
t.cr or sympathise with the loser, and tne
police had a busy quarter of an hour In
retting the people out of the bul.dlng
ritztlinmoha left the building live min
ctos after he had struck the winring
blow, but it took Ruhlin twelve minute-?
to como around fo he could walk to niÂ»
t2rÂ«Fing-room. Fitzplrnmons wax a little
t'.t dczed when he reached his dressing
room on the Fourth-avenue side of :hÂ«!
pprdcn. and .-irked some of thosre gathered
about him if it was not the fifteenth round
in which the fight was finished. He soon
rt-onvrred hi? reason and then indulged in
a hearty laugh.
"Wen." he said. "I'm an old fellow and
a 'has been.' ch? Well, I grUcss I was
good enough for Mr. RuMin,.and he was
not bo bad, either. That was as tough
a battle as 1 ever went through, but I
am still good for a few more. Ruhlin Is
a good one. and with a little more expe

realize it at the time. I can tell you he

FITZ SAYS RUHLIN
FOUGHT A FINE BATTLE
Â» Â¦
NETO7 YORK, Aug. 10.â Ruhlin fought a great battle and only
stopped when he was knocked senseless. He gave me the hard
est battle of my career and I give him all the credit in the -world for
tha showing he made. I think he must have realized that he
â¢sras a beaten man after he received a terrific body punch in the sec
ond round, but he continued fighting until he was absolutely help
less. His display of pluck astonished me. His ability to slug and
keep up a fast pace "was also a revelation. He is a far better fighter
than I gave Mm credit for.
I am open to fight any man in the world. My next match will
be â¢with Tom Sharkey at the Garden on August 27. After that con
test I will be prepared to make a match with Jeffries for the heavy
weight championship of the world. ROBERT FITZSIMMONS.
in order to get him. He gave m e a good
fight, and I can give him nothing but
praise."
Bob's seconds wished him to take a
bath right away, but he refused, saying
his wife was waiting for him and he must
go home. And as soon as he got his
clothes on he left the building, followed
by an admiring and cheering crowd.
Ruhlin Recovers Slowly.
Ruhlin, when he reached his dressing
room, was in a sort of trance, anu it Â¦was
a long time before he fully understood
that he had been defeated. He was badly
bruised about the head, and both eyea
were almost closed. He did not care to
talk, but managed to say:
"I did the best I could and no man
can do more. Fitzsimmons whipped me,
and that's all I can say about it."
Billy Madden. Ruhlln's manager, de
clared that Gus' defeat was due to over
training.
James J. Corbett, who acted as one
of Ruhlin's seconds, also declared that
Ruhlin was overtrained. "I know this,"
he- said, "for he was with me during my
preparations for my bout with Jeffries.
After that Gus continued training for his
battle with Sharkey, and worked even
harder after that for his bout with Fitz
simmons. I warned him that he was do-
Ing too much, but he imagined he could
stand it. Anybody could see to-night that
something was wrong with him. as he
6ent the right to the jaw repeatedly, but
the necessary strength was not behind the
blows."
Charlie White, who refereed to-night's
bout, said:
"It was a hard and fierce fight. In which
both men fought fairly. Fitzsimmons
clearly demonstrated that he Is not n 'has
been.' and still has the punch that wins.
Ruhlin at times looked as if he might
win, but he lacks experience, which will
be remedied In time, and I have no doubt
that he will be heard from to much bet
ter advantage later on."
BRIEF SUMMARY OF
THE FIGHT BY ROUNDS
NEW YORK. Aug. 10.â Following is a
description of the fight by rounds:
ROUND ONE,
They met in the center of the ring; both
feinting. Fitzsimmons landed a llghi
right on the ear and Ruhlin countered

and right to the chin. Fitzsimmons
missed left and right swings to the head.
Fitz bored in, but in a mix-up Gus beat
him off to the ropes with left and right
to the face. Ruhlin went at Bob with
both hands to the head, cutting Fltz's left
eye and Bob slipped to the floor. As he
got up Ruhlin, who did not hear the bell,
swung on Fitz's face. Bob's seconds
claimed a foul, but it was not allowed.
ROUND TWO.
Gus was the aggressor. Bob ducked a
left swing, and they exchanged rights and
lefts on the face and a rattling exchange
followed. Fitz hooked his left to the
nose, bringing blood, and another rapid
mix-up followed. Bob bored in, but Gus
met him with left ana right to the face,
both fighting wildly. Fitz sent a hard
left to the body and followed with right
and left to the body, which made Ruhlin
wobble and he cinched. Ruhlin sent a
left to the face and repeated the blow.
Fitzsimmons shot his left to the ear and
brought his right up to the body. A left

IS A GREAT FIGHTER
'
NEW YORK, Aug. 10.â Fitzsimmons is a gTeat old fellow. He
made the fight of his life to-night and is entitled to all possi
ble credit for his victory. ' I had him guessing for awhile, and up to
the time of the knockout I think it was anybody's fight. How
ever, Fitzsimmons beat me and he did so on his merits. He's a long
way from being a "has been." Fitzsimmons can hit as hard as he
ever could, and he is every bit as clever. He gave me some pretty
hard knocks and I gave him qnite a few, but he landed the best blow
and got the money. He fought a hundred per cent better battle with
me than he did with. Jeffries. GUS RUHXIN.

Uneasiness at Covelo Because There

Search Parties May Be
Organized.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
COVELO, Aug. 10. â Three of the mem-'
bers of Sheriff Taylor's tracking party ar
rived from the rock fastnesses of Yolo
Bolle mountains this afternoon, having
been outwitted by Murderer King's ma
neuvers, and decided to abandon the
chase They attempted to find and confer
with Sheriff Taylor leaving, but
could not locate his trail, but the last seen
of him was Wednesday, when he was iol
loivlng the tracks of the fugitive.
A great deal of uneasiness is manifest
here to-night among the returning trail
ers about the safety of Sheriff Taylor and
four men that are now known to be with
him besides a Mr. Armstrong, a son
in-law of Church, the murdered man. It
is understood here that two of the lead
ers of the different posses who have re
turn6d expected telegraphic instructions
from Taylor not later than Thursday.
Taylor expected to touch at either Pas
kenta. Red BlufT. Harrison Gulch or Red
ding. Nothing, however, up to this hour
has been heard. It Is not improbable, they
argue, that a desperate light may have
taken place, in which instance King and
his half-breed Indian pilot would certain
ly have the advantage by prepared am
bush. Should ro word be received from
Sheriff Taylor very soon a number of .vol
unteers contemplate organizing a search
ing party to go over the route recently
traversed by all the posses and make a
careful search for any trace of the mlss
lns posse. The country that Taylor and
his party were tracking King through is
a densely timbered and wild one and ex
perienced- mountaineers, have frequently
lost their bearings.

POSSEJIAY BE LOST
Outcome of the Oakland Man's Un
pleasant Experience With a Con
stable and Wealthy Resi
dent of Mill Valley.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAX RAFAEL, Aug. 10.â Nathaniel
Black of Oakland, also well known in
San Francisco, tells of an exciting and
unpleasant experience he had at Mill
Valley last night with Constable Richard
McDonald and R. P. Murphy, a -wealthy
resident of the valley. To the indignity
of threats against his person was added
an enforced walk for safety to Sausalito
where he sought shelter with Constable
Creed of that place. That is Mr. Black's
version of the incident, and he has
authorized an attorney to bring a dam
age suit against the constable and the
citizen.
Mr. Black has been spending the sum
mer at the home of Robert Staley of San
Francisco, who has a residence at Mill
Valley. Yesterday afternoon, according
to the story told by Mr. Black, he left
Mr. Staley's house and sauntered up on
the hill where he sat down and rested.
He had been seated but a few minutes
when a little boy and girl came along and
Mr. Black engaged them in conversa
tion. They had been piaying and talking
but a few minutes when Miss Irene
Murphy appeared at the door of a house
a hundred yards away and sharply called
the children away.
Mr. Black dismissed the matter from
his mind and proceeded to finish his walk.
He afterward returned to his house,
and in the evening, while walking down
by the railroad track near the station.
Constable Richard McDonald arrested
him upon two chargesâ one for attempt
ing to kidnap two children and the other
for using insulting language to Miss
Murphy. Mr. Black, who says he was
dumfounded at the actions of the con
stable, was also roundly abused by R.
P. Murphy, the father of the girl, who
ordered him to leave town.
An apology to Irene Murphy was first
demanded, however. Black says he
thought that he saw a way to prove that
he had never spoken to the girl, and eo
consented. When brought lntoiher pre
sence he says he asked her if he had
ever spoken to her, and she promptly
answered "No." He thought this was
sufficient and fully expected to be re
leased from his unpleasant position. After
leaving the Murphy home, where he had
met the girl, he was warned by the.
father and the constable to leave town or
suffer the consequences.
When seen to-day he said that believ
ing that he was in peril he im
mediately started to walk to Sausa
lito, a distance of six miles. He stopped
there last night and came to this city on
the first train this morning, where he en
listed the services of Attorney J. \V.
Cochrane, who to-morrow will file a
$10,000 damage suit against Constable
McDonald and R. P. Murphy. McDonald
is well known in this county.
Mr. Black, who is well known in San
Francisco and Oakland, is connected with
the Pullman Crjr Company and the
Remington Typewriter Company. Mr
Staley, at whoso home Mr. Black wan
staying, is the secretary of the Home Oil
Company and also well known In San
Francisco.
BLACK WILL BRING
SUIT FOR $10,000

Convicted of Murder.
In a fow minutes Detective Auble tele
phoned that Slovinski had committed
euicide. Mrs. Slovinski gave a wild
scream ana then became completely pros
trated. Capitalist Maines. chatting with
his attorneys, seemed dazed .over tne
tiewp. but remained in the courtroom until
sifter Mrs. Plnvinsk: was taken away.
When Auble reached Slovinski's room
he found the body stretched on a small
-ot a double-barreled shotgun still
The Detective's Message.
The preliminary examination com
menced two days ago, and was to have
bft-n continued this morning at 9:30. At
that hour Mrs--. Slovirski. with her little
fun and several women acquaintances,
were in the court room, together with thÂ«
attorneys on both sides, but Slovinski had
not put in an appearance, and after wait
ing five or ten minutes a messenger was
pent to the lodging house where Siovinski
had been rooming, to toll him that he was
delaying the case and to come at once.
The messenger had hardly departed when
Justice Austin ie^uf-d nn attachment for
Slovinski. which was given to Detective
Auble to serve, and he at once started
out.
About 10 o'clock the meseenger who was
first sent out returned and hurriedly
fpr.ke a few words to the lawyer for the
defense-, saying that just as he reached
the house he had heard a shot fired, and
had at once returned.
Slovinski had accused Midnes at an
interview with being on too friendly terms
with his wil>. and alleged that the latter
had confessed her tranFfrreF.sione, ami
then, drawing a pistol, threatened to kill
Maines unless he signed the notes. Maines
did fo and then ha'd recourse to law.
Obtaining the Notes.
Plovinski and his wii> were arrested
pome lime ago. accused of having forced
Capitalist A. R. Maines, at- the point of
a pistol, to sign two notes, one for $5000
and another for Jli.OO).
This was the sensational manner in
whicii a 5cnsatior.nl case has come to an
end. It iÂ« believed that lie killed himself
in a fit of despair when he saw there was
no escape, from the toils of the law, which
were cloying about him. but he left no
note riving his reasons for the rash act.
LOS ANGELES. Aug. lO.-John M.
Slovinski, accused of blackmail
ing and extortion, this morning
ended the judicial proceedings
agair.Â«t him by blowing out his
brains at the house where he was living
Â¦wiih his wife and child.
Special rxeratch to The Call.
Mrs. Slovinskl had been jointly accused

Fires When the Messenger Comes.
When he saw the attorney's messenger,
whom he apparently knew by sight, rap
idly approaching he laid down on the cot,
adjusted his gun. carefully aimed by a
little mirror he held in his hand, and as
he heard the man coming up the steps he
pressed the trigger with his foot.
Following is the only note left by Slo
vinski, so far as known:
LOP ANGELES. Aug. 10.â My wish Is that
the landlarfv be said for any bedding or furni
ture damaged. J. M. SLOVINSKI.
Mrs. Slovinski Is completely prostrated
over the tragedy.
A. R. Maine*, the complaining witness
in the case, says he feels easier. In an
interview with The Call's correspondent
he said:
clutched In the dead man's hands. One
barrel had been discharged. Slovlnski
bad placed the muzzle of the gun in his
!!iouth and discharged the weapon bv
pressing with one foot a short stick which
had been tied across the trigger with a
piece of fishing line. The full charge en
tered his head, which was literally re
duced to pulp by the force of the concus
sion. Death had been instantaneous,
there having apparently only been one
convulsive movement withdrawing the
muzzle of the gun from his mouth.
Everything pointed to suicide planned
and rarri<v1 out with the greatest delib
eration. Slovinski had first removed his
coat, phops, collar and necktie.
Having completed all preparations, it is
evident that SlovineKi seated himself at
'the double windows on the south side of
the room, from which he could command
a view of the street from Fifth street, and
awaited the coming of the messenger who
he anticipated would be for him
when he failed to appear in court at the
proper time.
JOHN' M. SLOVINSKI. -WHO PREFERRED DEATH TO DISGRACE.
"I think you were right in what you
said about Andree. A short time ago
some Indians arrived here from the Mac
kenzie and I learned from them that a
balloon was seen to land near the mouth
of that river during the, winter before last.
Some men landed from it and made a
camp. They remained a short time and
then got into the car. They then threw
something out. the natives said, on the
Ice and the balloon went up into the air.
It was soon out of sight. The natives
were afraid and did not visit. the camp.
The natives who came here (Fort Yukon)
did not- see the balloon themselves, but
were. toM of its coming by people living
to the northward of them. I could not
find out anything about the men at all."
.Mr. Harrison, who is bound to Dawson,
says in his letter that he will make every
endeavor to ascertain the truth of tha
Btory of the Indians, and If possible learn
more. It is considered not at all improb
able that the Indians may have given out
this report in the hope of getting a re
ward, for some months ago. notices were
sent to the northern trading posts and
freely circulated in the Northwest, from
Lynn" Canal 'to the Arctic, in which a re
ward was offered by the Norwegian Gov
ernment for any information of the lost
exploring party. In these notices, which
no doubt reached the northern settle
ments months ago, the balloon is de
scribed and pictured, and the offer of
money for information made so that the
Indians may be spreading the story of the
balloon having been seen to get. the prof
fered reward.
VICTORIA, B. C, Aug. 10.â The steamer
Tees, which .arrived this morning, brought
a belated report of the sighting of a
balloonâ presumably that of the missing
AndreÂ© and his companionsâ near the
mouth of the Mackenzie River in the
winter of 189S. The news Is given In a
letter written by a miner at Fort Yukon
to a 'friend at Selkirk. The letter was
shown to Fred Harrison of Montreal, who
copied it and forwarded its contents to
Victoria. The letter said:

Until to-morrow, however, he let
Frankle Himes and Elmer Martin go
home with the parents of Martin, but
committed Fred Himos to Jail.
"I want to state." said Justice* Tucker
in conclusion, "that my Jurisdiction will
not permit me to let these boys go on
ball. After the examination I will have
to commit them and let a higher court
settle the question."
The District Attorney consulted with
Mr. Harris and they agreed lo have the
preliminary examination at 11 o'clock to
morrow morning. It was so ordered by
tho court.
FRESNO, Aug. 10.â Fred and Franklc
Himes and Elmer Martin appeared before
Justice of the Peace Tucker this after
noon for arraignment on a charge of
murder. They were accompanied by a
number of relatives and the County At
torney, M. K. Harris. The courtroom
was crowded with people eEtger to get a
glimpse of the youthful criminals.
The lads stood up facing the magistrate
while he read the complaint preferred by
Deputy Sheriff John AVhlte, charging
them with murder. The little fellows did
not seem to realize the significance of the
legal phraseology describing their terrible
crime.
"This will be only an examination,
bovs," said the court fter the complaint
had been read, "but you will be entitled
to the process of the court to procure
witnesses. You are also entitled^ to an
attorney." .
At this point Judge Harris stated that
he had been retained by Mr. and Mrs.
Martin to defend their son and that :ie
would act as attorney for all the boys.

PASTY FOOD
Too Commonly Used.
The use of pssty cereals is not advis-
ible. A physician says: "Pasty cereals
are very indigestible and a bad thing
â¢or the stomach, causing a depressed
"eeling end quite a train of disorders,
particularly of the intestines and nerves.
"Cereals", such as wheat and oats, can
dc cooked long enough and well cnouch
:o fit them for hurn2n use, but the or-
dinary way of cooking leaves them in a
pasty condition."
A gentleman from Evansville. Ind..

cation to the Postum Cereal Co.. Ltd..
flattie Creek, Mich., says: "My physi-
iian prohibited the use of oats and

CLIMBING FRISCO
IS REACHING FOR
THE FIRST PLACE
Teams of the League Are
Closing Up, All Except
Oakland.
The question of. the ability of the Frisco
ball tossers to make another gain on the
champions this week depends largely on
the capacity of the Dudes from across the
bay. If the Dudes are able to cope with
the champions this week they may make
the fur. fly at Recreation Park and glad
den the hearts of the local fans. Last
week the Oaklands were in a badly crip
pled condition, but they managed to break
even with the Sacram<\tos.
Uncle Henry has been eating dish after
dish of victory, and any reverse would
be a cause for wrathful indignation on
the part of the local fanatics. They have
by an unparalleled series of victories shot
from last to ..second place. Sacramento
leads' by 2 less than 100 per cent. It is
many weeks since the champions have
not 'had a lead greater than 100. This
series may change the positions of the
second and third teams, but cannot alter
tho place of the leaders or the tail-enders.
Tho standing of the league clubs is as
follows: , .
Mr. Spreckels left for the East last
night on a month's trip for both business

The yearlings have been perfectly brok

and one which he thinks will be thorough
ly successful.

The promising litter of puppies by St.

an unfortunate setback this week. Lady
Blanche was attacked by eczema and th >
puppies In turn were similarly affected by
the disease. Casserly & Kerrigan, owners
of tho litter, are hopeful that prompt
treatment may bring the puppies around
in due time.
Russell. Allen & Wilson are having bad
luck -with their greyhounds. Spiteful has
gone wrong, and, in fact, out of the t wen
ty-ttve dogs of the well known kennel
there are but four or five which
are not laid up and , which are
tit for training. The doss have
contracted a sort of muscular rheu
matism which affects them In a manner
making exercise impossible. Many of tho
hounds arc entered In the Futurity, and
unless an improvement is shown soon the
firm's chances for recognition In that
great event will be handicapped.

In Thursday's reserve stake at San Ma

hearts of the pikers in the first round of
that event. As good as It) to 1 was quoted
against Dempsey's flier In the go with
Lear King. The dogs ran an undecided,
and In the run-oft Jingle Bells got the
flag. Superstition is a factor with cours
ing men as well as with followers of other
sports. On the morning train to the park
a piker who is well known as a hunch
player noticed that the number 13 figured
conspicuously in the make-up of the trnin.
The> engine and every car had the "hoo
doo" figures, which fact caused the piker
to feel sure that he had a cinch If he
could study the hunch out. He flgurad to
play 13 to a finish and selected the Jingle
Bells course, which was thirteenth on tha
card. Bet after bet he played until his
pile was exhausted, and when at last tha
flag was raised giving Jingle Bella the de
cision the piker awoke.
The San Mateo management will tako
up all passes on Sunday and give out a
new Issue. The move 13 not to deprive
any person who is entitled to free admis

association from the abuse of pass own
ers who allow their tickets to gain en
trance for half a dozen or more people on
days when admission Is charged. The new
pass will be non-transferrable. and if pre
sented at the gate by any other person

Very little play is going on at present

Robert Johnstone. the instructor of the
San Francisco Golf Club, recently paid a
visit to Redwood City to select suitable
grounds for a golf course. The Selby
tract, near Fair Oaks, which was used
last year as a racecourse, has been leased

learn no southern golfers will come up
this year. C. E. Maud and C. E. Orr are
in Great Britain, W. Cos&y and Conde
Jones are at Bakersfleld, and no others
are likely to come north. Had there been
a team match this .year as there was in
1S90 it ia possible that the southerners
would have come, but they do not care
to make so long a journey for Individual

the crews o* the two boats taking second

K rr.eri Is that the Olympic Boat Club and
the Triton Sv.imming and Boating Club
should unite and form one club, to bo

obvious. The Triton club has only about
twenty-five members, none of whom take
any active part ia regattas on the bay.
The Olympic Boat Club quarters at Bel

of much real use as a training place for

Dr. J. F. Twist has returned from a
fortnight's outing in Mendoclno County.
He Is enthusiastic over the sport found
there in quest of deer. The first day out
he and his. companion, P. J. Morrin, killed'
two fine bucks and could readily, have
secured more had they followed others
which crossed their path. .The two
nlmrods went from this city on a coasting
steamer, from which they disembarked at
Greenwood after fifteen hours' travfl.
They placed themselves In charge of J.

SOCIETY WILL ATTEND

In Indian mounted officers traveling by

fer it. take a bicycle with them at Gov-
ernment expense In lieu of a charger.It is Raid Bryan will do most of his campaigning j n
the East as he did before, and it is a safe prediction
the result will be as it was before.
Another serious blow has been struck at the cam
paign principles of the Bryanites* It is reported that
Nebraska and South Dakota are exceptionally pros
perous and that this is an off season for- calamity
howlers.
According to a recent report there are in Germany
861 schools and institutes giving instruction in man
ual training, and they have under their control *s
many as 1514 workshops. Such figures explain the
wonderful success Germany has had of recent years
in competing for the world's commerce, and show
other people what they will have to-do in order to
keep op with the procession.
\ Despite the fact that Senator Wellington has de
serted the Republican party and gone over to the
Bryanites, ex-Mayor Latrobe of Baltimore, a sound
money Democrat, declares Maryland safe for the Re
publican ticket by 40.000 majority. Wellington is
evidently one of the fellows who never will be missed.

To elect a good Legislature it will be necessary that
every good citizen do; his whole ! political duty.- No
man should shirk it. Those who have not registered
should do so at once. Those who have not yet joined
the Republican club of their district should attend
to that duty. The victory is not going to be-\jron by
talking of honest politics on the -street's or in the
clubs, hut by getting out and working for it. In every
Assembly and; every Senatorial district . the. railroad
and the bosses will have their candidates and their
workers. Decent^ Republicans must meet these men
at every point. Not a single-seat should be tamely
surrc ndered ' to the gari g.
IZ^ VERY Republican in this city worthy of the
repute of a goo-i citizen should at this time bear
â f in mind' that he has to perform in the coming
election a duty to the State, not less important than
that to ; the nation. The Legislature to be elected
in November will have to reapportibn all the As
sembly, the Senatorial and the Congressional dis
tricts. Moreover, the State Senators chosen this year
will hold over and have a vote for the election of a
United States Senator to succeed Perkiris. ' By reason
of those facts the railroad and the combined Demo
cratic and Republican bosses are making strenuous
efforts to control the Legislature. The only power
that can prevent them from achieving that object is
that of the better elements of the Republican party.
Unless that. force be exerted by united >nd vigorous
action, the outlook for California politics will be
gloomy indeed. ,'â¢;.-:
t The issueis not one of merely partisan importance.
For the election: of good men to the Legislature
honest Republicans can rightly ask all independent
and public-spirited citizens to' unite with them. They
can also count upon receiving the support of no in
considerable number of the better class of Demo
crats, if upon the Republican /'State ticket there be:
placed" candidates who deserve the confidence and the
respect of their fellow-citizens. There will be victory
for the party and for the people if such candidates be
nominated. There will be defeat if men of, the" type
of Dibble and Wolfe are set before the voters as
representatives of San Francisco. Republicanism. ,

A CHANCE TO LAUGH.
There are evidences that Great Britain has trot acted
in good faith. Her stubborn and selfish assertion of
exclusive action in the Yangtsekiang has justified the
suspicion that she has cherished secret* designs of ter
ritorial aggrandizement and that her grabbing spirit i<?
unquenched. Fortunately she is, by President Mc-
Kinley's wisdom, to be met by a hostile concert of
the powers under the leadership of the United States
that will defeat her sinister ambitions.
If, as now appears, Germany and Russia concede to
him abstention from territorial designs, he has ac
complished for China what she could not do for her
self. .
This action was taken by the President on his own
responsibility, and with a just estimate of the power
of this Government to set the pace for the other
powers. They might trifle with China, but-tfiry dare
not trifle with the United States. The' world owes
much to the nice discretion and wisdom of President
McKinley in the most difficult and dangerous situa
tion that has ever confronted it, and his own coun
trymen will not easily forget what they owe to him
for it.
It will be observed that President McKinley has
dominated and in effect dictated the purpose of the
advance of the relief column. He has made it not
an expedition for conquest or looting, but for one
object, the relief of the legations, in effect co
operating with the expressed purpose of China to se
cure their safety against her disorderly and rebellious
subjects.
As China promptly responded to his firsf request
and has kept faith, as he has, it is only reasonable to
expect a like response to this.
From the beginning he has been the chief reliance
for safety of ail foreigners in that country. He has
carefully distinguished between their military rescue
and the making of war upon China. The concession
of iree communication between foreign Ministers an<l
their Governments was the direct rssdt of. his letter
to the Emperor, and now, in his last communication,
he treats the Chinese Government as acting in good
kith and puts it to the test. He says that as Minis
ter Conger believes it would mean death to the lega
tioners to leave Peking under Chinese escort: "We
therefore urge upon the imperial Government that it
shall adopt the course suggested in the third clause
of the President's letter to his Majesty the Emperor
of China of July 23, 1900, and enter into communica
tion with the relief expedition, so that co-operation
may be secured between them for the liberation of
the legations, the protection of foreigners and the res
toration of order. Such action of the imperial Gov
ernment would be a satisfactory demonstration of
its friendliness and desire to attain these ends."
AGAIN' President McKinley has shown the su
periority of his diplomatic methods in dealing
with the difficult. situation in China.

(FROM LE MONDE ILLUSTRE.)
It^is to be borne in mind that the week covered by
the report was a week" of the hot midsummer, when
enterprise is not very active in any part of the East
ern States. Such progress in the direction of new
manufacturing enterprises made in a single week of
sweltering July goes far to explain why the Demo
crats of the Southern Industrial League object to any
report before election. It would have been indeed a
Republican campaign document, for it would have
borne witness to the fact that in the South itself the
fruits of Republican legislation have been those of in
dustry, progress, and prosperity. i - v
In the absence of afiy comprehensive report for the
year from the Southern Industrial League, the condi
tions in that section may be inferred from the fact
that the Chattanooga Tradesman reports that during
the week ending July 28 there were established a
$10,000 basket and crate factory in the Fort Valleyj
Ga., fruit district; a broom factory in Middle Geor
gia; a cigar factory in Florida; coal mines in Arkan
sas and West Virginia; electric light and power
plants in Georgia, Kentucky and Texas; a palmetto
fiber factory at Gainesville, Fla; a flouring mill and
grain elevator at Clarksbufg, W. Va.; hardware and
supply companies in Georgia and Texas; a $50,000
harness and saddlery works at Dallas, Tex. ; an- ice
factory in Virginia;, an irrigation company in Texas;
a" knitting mill in North Carolina; lumber' mills in
Arkansas, Mississippi, South Carolina and .Tennessee;
a $600,000 mining and development company in Ar
kansas; a $50,000 novelty works at Wheeling, W. Va.;
natural gas and oil companies in the Eastern Ken
tucky and West Virginia fields: an elevator manufac
turing company in Tennessee; a $10,000 shirt factory
in Atlanta, Ga.; a soap factory in Kentucky; telephone
companies in the Carolinas f and Texas, and a tobacco
factory in Kentucky.
Such a story hardly seems credible, and yet it comes
as straight as any other news of the day. The inci
dent could have happened only in the South, where
business men are forced into an unnatural alliance
with Bryanism. It shows how absurd is Southern
politics, and goes far to confirm the truth of a state
ment attributed to Senator Money of Alabama, that
the business men of ihe South wish the re-election of
McKinley and therefore favored the renomination of
Bryan by the Democrats as the surest way of bring
ing it about.
r ROM Atlanta comes a story that strikingly illus :
tratcs the confusion produced in the minds of
the Southern people by the conflict between
their politics and their industries. At the recent con
vention in that city of the Southern Industrial League
a committee was appointed to draw up f6r publica
tion a report of the conditions of trade and industry
in the Southern States. When the report was read
the politicians in the convention arose at once to pro
test. They declared it to be in the nature of a Re
publican campaign document. Publish that report of
prosperity, they said, and you will put a club in the
hands of Mark Hanna to beat us over the head on
every stump in the Union. Another committee ap
pointed to revise the report struggled with the issue
for some time and then came back With a recommen
datien that no report be made until after the election.

We believe the American people will prefer the gold
standard, two per cent interest on the public debt,
the continuance of good times, the employment of all
our working people", plenty of food for their table
and clothing for their bodies, and will trust to the
sober second thought of the people, manifested in
orderly reaction, to extricate the country from- the
difficulties into which this lobbyist plunged it when
he procured the ratification of the conquest of the
Agitation then would have presented the one ques
tion of conquest and would have settled it against the
purchase of the Philippines. It would have involved
no other consequences, and would have endangered
no interests. Therefore he did not want agitation
then, but he wants it now. He turned his back upon
his Omaha speech,' lobbied for the treaty, accom
plished the conquest, violated every principle which
he now asserts, and asks to be trusted to rid the coun
try of the consequences of a treaty for which he alone
is responsible.
This timid politician was afraid of agitation!
That was the very .time to agitate the public mind.
Spain was powerless to reopen hostilities. The pro
tocol ratified for her by Cambon dominated the situ
ation. If the great principles which no man disputes
were put in peril by the treaty, as he now charges, no
time was too long to spend in their vindication.
That was the time to agitate the public minfl. He
does not scruple to agitate it now on that same sub
ject, when its agitation may mean the votes which will
give him the power to overthrow our financial sys
tem, destroy our credit and bring on another whirl
wind of panic and pinch of distress. Measuring the
man as we are justified in doing:, he did not want the
agitation then, for it would not help his ambition to
be President. It would not forward his ulterior pur
pose to put the country on a silver standard. It would
not push the policy of the Chicago platform for the
overthrow of the courts, the denial of the freedom of
contract, the abolition of the legislative branch of our
system and the destruction of representative gove-n
ment.
That was applicable and unusually sane for him.
But he went down South and into camp with his regi
ment, where it dallied with dysentery for a few
months, when he resigned and, according to his suc
cessor in the colonelcy, declared his purpose of going
tc Washington to help secure the ratification of the
Paris treaty. As we have said, the treaty was then beaten
by the Republicans, un'ler the leadership of Senato*"
Hoar, because it proposed to confirm the conquest of
the Philippines. Bryan induced seventeen Democratic
Senators to come to its support andTatifiejd.it. VHi?*
lobbying completed the conquest of the Philippines.
His responsibility as the leader of his party has not
been . forgotten. He abandoned the theory of his
Omaha speech. He forgot all, about consent of the
governed. He added "'hypocrisy to greed" in a
double sense, and lost the confidence of the anti
cxpansionists. Now he seeks to reinstate himself, be
cause he wants votes, while it is a fact of public
knowledge that his Southern supporters, who will
give him 120 electoral votes, are practically unani
mous for holding the Philippines. He sees with un
usual clearness, for him, that his support of the treaty
is his weak point, ami in his acceptance speech, tries
to avoid its consequences. This is his excuse:- "If
the treaty had been rejected considerable time would i
necessarily have elapsed before a new treaty could
have been agreed upon and ratified, and during that
time the question would have been agitating the pub
lic mind." Â¦ (
On June 25. 1898, just after his appointment as
colonel of the Nebrask-i regiment for the Spanish w*r,
Colonel Bryan, bedizened and belly-bande.d in his spick
and span new uniform, made a speech at the dedi
cation of the Nebraska building at the Omaha Ex
position, in which he said: "If a contest undertaken
for the sake of humanity degenerates into a war of
conquest, we shall find it difficult to meet the charge
of having added hypocrisy to greed/ Our guns de
stroyed a Spanish fleet, but can they destroy that
self-evident truth that governments^derive th^ir just
powers, not from superior force, but from the con
sent of the governed?"
The anti-expansionists 'of the country have never
trusted Colonel Bryan. They know that the trouble
came with the ratification of the treaty of Paris. The
Republican opposition to that treaty was so strong
thnt it could not depend on Republicans for success
in the Senate.. They had it beaten, and proposed to
amend out of it the pu: chase of the Philippines. That
purchase was nothing more nor less _than the ac
complishment of a conquest. It was vacant of any
other feature. It was paying for a title that had al
ready been extinguished by conquest.
He avoids comment" upon the denial of the guar
antees of the constitution to people at home. He is
dumb upon the defiant violation by his own party
in the South of every principle he asserts as necessary
to the preservation of freedom. He quotes Lincoln
as glibly as the devil h supposed to quote Scripture,
but he nowhere applies the known principles of Lin
coln to the doings of his own party south of Mason
and Dixon's line. His leading manager, Tillman of
South Carolina, declared in the Senate that when
the negroes exercised their constitutional right to
vote they were murdered by the Bryan men of the
South, and when they risked their lives to get in a
ballot it. was nullified by fraud.
â¢-âÂ» OLOXEL BRYAN shunted silver in his ac
( ceptance speecli, and, after some generally
/ . damnatory remarks about "plutocracy," to
which we have already referred, devoted the rest of
his document to his prize issue of imperialism. In
the main it consists of a restatement of fundamental
I>rincipies that are as old as Magna Charta. No one
is in opposition to them; they are settled parts of our
polity and in no more danger of disturbance than are
the Rock}' Mountains in danger of a change in, their
axis. But Bryan presents them as offsprings of his
own brain and himself as their only efficient cham
pion and defender, and his election as necessary to
their preservation. It will be observed that he cries
for their application to the external people with whom
we are unhappily involved as a miserable legacy of the
Spanish war. That war he urged on the ground that
it would be good politics, and of course he is now
striving to get what politics he can out of its results,
which were foreseen ar.d feared by wiser men than he.

This argument is so self-evident it is hardly likely
any considerable number of growers will hold out
against it. The association has now been fairly es
tablished. It is under the control of able and re
liable business men, and there is no longer any doubt
of the practicability of, co-operation along the lines
proposed. Consequently those growers who have
hitherto remained outside by .reason of one form
x>f doubt or another can have no good excuse for
continuing to do so. The co-operation, of all growers
will be better than the co-operation of 90 per -cent,
and it is therefore to be hoped the meetings will be
successful in bringing all the outsiders. into the asso
ciation and thus strengthen it in the work it. has un
dertaken for the general welfare.
cent of the growers are outside the association.
Those men of course cannot fix a price for their fruit
higher than that of the association. All they can, do'
is to sell cheaper and thereby compel the association
to some extent to reduce prices, to meet the oubide
competition/ The only effect of such tactics would
be to unsettle the market. The injury resulting would
of course be felt more by the growers than/ any one
else, and certainly the "outsiders could not profit any
thing by it.

A scandal has arisen in connection with
the trial before a. Jury of Henry, Schwartz
fpr violating the ordinance against pool-
Belling. It is openly charged by some of
the Jurors that Harry Baun of the Colum
bia auction rooms, 1015 Market street, was
tied up for the defense before he entered
the Jury room Friday night, and through
his efforts secured a disagreement.
The Jury after being locked up all night
came into court & few minutes brfore 7
0 clock yesterday mprnlng and In answer
to Judge Cabamss the foreman said tliev
had been I unable to .agree. The Judge
had no other recourse but to dismiss them.
*Ws A - Walker of 1610 Clay street, one ot
the Jurors, told the Judge that three werÂ»
for acquittal. They were Harry Baun
O. D. Mongola. 329 Hayes street? and J
F. Kingston. HO Fourth street. He made
certain statements as to the conduct ot
Juror Baun which he repeated to Cdiet
Suhl van. Captain Seymour. and Attorney
<~offey, who specially prosecuted. lie
said i . â¢ - Â¦ . - - v Â¦
K^Â»f un J , reall8ft that Baun was bought
by the defense. The court definitely in
structed us to find upon the law and not
the fact, and conviction was the onlv
thing possible. The first two ballots to f
talned blanks, and Baun was | said to be
asleep. When he did vote he was seen to
?Jl te ? ot Â« ullt > <m Ms slip of -paper
When he came into the room he waved
his hand to Schwartz, and I suspected
then what was coming. I belie\-e, as do
most of the other jurors, that Baun was
bought. I stood up In the presence of the
other Jurors and made the charge ODenlv
and it was not denied. We sail we were
willing to be convinced if we were wrong
but Baun. and the other two refused to
aiscuss the matter with us." â¢.. ,
When Baun was being examined as to
hhvquallficatlons to serve on Uie Jury he
said that he did not know Schwartz, but
admitted, knowing Dan Crowley, the pool
seller. He promised to give a fair and
impartial verdict. Attorney Coffey Uu"d
have challenged - him; but all hfs chal
lenges had been exhausted. '

\\ alker's statement, that it waa Â¦ too bad
such a thing should happen, but he did

Scandal Arises Out of Trial
of Bookmaker Henry
Schwartz
JUROR ACCUSED
OF BEING FIXED
BY THE DEFENSE
George Mendis. a sailor, was robbed of
H72 50 la-<=t Tuesday night. The woman
who robbed him attempted to cut her
throat and hang herself after her arrest,
end yesterday morning Mendis' dead body
was found with the throat x cut from ear
to ear, lying In a small storeroom In the
back part of the building at 416 Pacific
street. A razor was tightly clutiVexl in
the right hand of the corpse.
The building In which the ghastly deed
was committed is used as a boarding
house and frequently mostly by Portu
guese sailors. Mendis came down from
Eureka last Tuesday with nearly $200 of
hi* earnings and proceeded to enjoy life
on ehore among the landsharks. after the
manner of sailors generally. At the
boarding-house he feil in with a Portu
guese fairy, fat and forty, known as
Juana Lopet. The next day he caused
her arrest on a charge of grand larceny,
the sum stolen being $172 50. The police
found peereted In her room nearly the
whole of the money and held It for evi
dence on the triaL .
Mendis was very solicitous about his
money. He feared that the police grip
upon it would never relax and he so ex
pressed himself even after Sergeant Dono
van had assured him that his money
â¢would be returned to him immediately
after the trial. The sailor was very de
v Â«>ondent on Wednesday and Thursday
about the loss of his coin and told ManueJ
Lopez and George Santos that he intended
to kill himself. -
The woman, Juana Lopez, tried to cut
her throat with a penknife In a cell tn
the City Prison on Wednesday, shortly
after her arrest. She was then taken to
the Insanity ward of the City Receiving
Hospital and made two attempts to hang
herself there, so that the steward waa
obliged to put her In a straitjacket.
Mendle entered the saloon attached to
the boardlr.g-house about half-past 7
o'clock yesterday morning and took a

drink. He then passed to the rear to a
small storeroom leading Into the back
yard and cut his throat from ear to ear,
the head being nearly severed from the
bo.Jy. Mendis was about 40 years old, a
native of Cape Verde Islands and un
married. A bankbook was among his ef
fects, showing that he had $200 on deposit
in the Hibernla Bank.
The woman was brought before' Police
Judge Conlan yesterday morning, but she
was not physically able to stand trial and
was sent back to the Receiving Hospital.
LEOPOLD STRASSMAN. an ex
convict and "dope fiend," fired
three shots at his old, almost blind
father. Dr. Max Stras^nan, yes
terday morning and although^ the wounds
ere not considered dangerous It is feared
that the old man may succumb to the
ehork to his system.
Strassman. owing to his criminal re
cord, hap been a stranger to his family
for years. His father, who is 75 years of
age and nearly blind, lived with his son
in-law, Joseph Pilger, at HIS Larkiri
street. Leopold had been seen hanging
around the neighborhood "for the past
week and Thursday he accosted his
house yesterday morning a few minutes
after 10 o'clock .and had walked onlv a
few yards when L*Â»pold, who was wait-
Ing across the street, ran toward htm
with a revolver- in his right hand.
He was â¢ seen to say something to the
old man and almost immediately fired
three shots at him in quick succession.
The old man fell to the sidewalk and Leo
pold ran away.
The shooting was witnessed by G. E.
Carlson of 519 Capp street. John Tor
mey of 230 Fell street, G. H. Linbaum
of id Tehama street, and others.
They ran to the wounded man and pick

third the fleshy part of the neck. They
did not consider any ot the wounds dan
gerous, but were afraid of the effect upon
his system owi*g to his advanced age.
The police were notified of the shooting
and Detectives McMalion and Crockett
were detailed on the case. With the as
sistance ofPoIiceman Herring they found
Leopold In a grocery, at ttee eornej: of
Bush and Lnrkin streets. They placed
him under arrest and locked him up in
the tanks pending th3 result of the old
man's in.iprlcs. When searched the re
volver with three chambers empty was
found in his pocket and also a file with a
sharp point and the (?i,d wrapped round
with heavy cord in the shape of a handle.
A package of opium was also found In
his pocket.
Â¦ He declined to make a statement as to
why he had shot his father. He acted
as if he were not in his right mind and
talked about his brother-in-law having
sent him a package of, poisoned candy
Thursday. He said he ate some of it and
nearly died and the rest he took to the
Board of Health office for analysis. The
statement was without foundation. He
al?o spoke bitterly about his brother, Ben
Strassman.
Leopold, who is a musician, 44 years of
age, first came to the notice of the police
In the beginning of 1SS2. He was arrested
under the name of George Wilson along
with a woman named Mary Collins on a
charge of grand larceny. April 22 he was

The largest of the. artillery pieces in the
United States army were landed in San
Francisco last night. They are called
siege guns, and make up the armament of
Siege Battery O, Seventh United States
Artillery, which has been stationed at
Fort Riley, Kansas, but Is now under or
ders for China. They are used for the
purpose of attacking defenses on land and,
are constructed to do terrible damage,
throwing shells filled with high explosives
which scatter death and destruction for
large areas around where they etrlke. The
battery is composed of a five-inch siege
gun and a seven-Inch howitzer and a. sev
en-inch mortar. When in use these guns
are mounted on heavy wooden platforms
surrounded by fortifications made of sand
bags. . v
i A shrapnel fired from a five-inch siege
gun will burst into 500 pieces, which fly
with terrific force in all directions, and the
ehrapnel from a seven-inch howitzer
bursts into nearly 1000 pieces. To destroy
fortifications the live-inch siege gun is
used, as puch work calls for a straight
fire, and the howitzer and mortar are used
for angle firing, with the intention of
dropping a death-dealing projectile in the
midst mi the enemy'protected by forts.. To
handle these guns and to move them from
place to place requires a large number of
men and heavy draft horses.

Books.
* Kcwsrd K. DufT. bookkeeper for Ben

r.nr fc!s wife since last Saturday. An
expert accountant is examining 1 the
books, but Benjamin M. Gunn denies that
any defalcation has t,c-en discovered so
far as h'.s knowledge goes.
Among Duff's acquaintances aJong:
Montgomery street two theories in ex
planation of his disappearance are held.
Some argue that he had become Involved
in ftnanciaJ difficulties through a recentlv
developed tendency to be sporty, and
fparir.g detection, he sought safety in
liipht. The other theory is that he has
<loped v.-''b. a married woman, a tenant

become interested of late.

did not return home in the evening and
rone of his acquaintances or relatives

"I am unwilling to make any state
ment." Benjamin M. Gunn said last
evening:, "until the repprt of the expert
Fhows whether there is anythin"
â¢wror.p with the books. I know jthat Duff
has been drinking a little of late, but
otherwise he was a young man of ex
emplary habits and excellent character.
a he young woman with whom his name
has been coupled by gossip is said to be
In the country with her husband."
Mr*. Duff denies indignantly that any
woman can be concerned in the case, as
her husband has been a model of kln-J
r)es5. and no trouble had ever occurred
between them.

tee will meet to-day and adjust some ques
tions pertaining to the "election of dele
gates to the State convention of that
party. Before the Supreme Court decision
on the primary law was rendered, the
committee issued a call designating San
Jo*e, August 30, as the place and time for
delegates to assemble. The committee to
day will probably designate September 2
as the time. There will be no change or
programme in respect to the place of
meeting.
The Republican County Committee will
meet \fi executive session to-night, and
renew the discussion of plans for holding
a primary election to choose delegates to
State and local conventions.

The eentlment of the parents In - the
vicinities of the Grant and Pacific Heights
Schools is simmering and next ; Tuesday
evening it will be given an opportunity
to boll over at a mass meeting to be held.
In Franklin Hall on Flllmore street, near.
Bush. - . Â¦ -*:
The mass meeting will be. under the
auspices of the Western Addition Im
provement Club. It was decided upon last
evening and to-morrow the calls _wlll gp
out. Parents who have children affected
by the order of the Board! of Education
will be" asked to give their views on the
situation, and it -Is more "than likely, that
some definite plan will be decided upon
to procure the running of the schools to
suit the interests and wishes of the neigh
borhood and the convenience and welfare
of the children.^. --, - -â¢
A mass meeting: had been under discus
sion by several of the citizens of the dis
trict, but nothing definite had been de
cided upon. There was plenty of feeling
In the district, and some parents> had
even g-one bo far as to say they would
send their youngsters to a private school
sooner than send them up .the hill to the
Grant, or -'out 'Into -the suburbs to the
Emerson. And the - feeling was made
doubly bitter by the fact that'close to the
heart of the district is the Pacific Heights
School, a modern building and heretofore
suitable in every way for children of all
agres. . -
Many of the parents are members of the
Western Addition Improvement Club, and
so the mass meeting will be one of club
and parents combined with- any one else
who will take interest euough to come.
The children 1 * Fide of the matter will be
presented by, the parents, and members
of the board or supporters of Its party
will be heard In defense of the, shifting: or
the pupils. .'Â¦â¢;. Â¦ - Â¦ '-â¢Â£Â¦Â¦
Among the speakers will be Arthur G.
Towne, Judge Van R. Paterson, Julius
Webster and William Ross. The members
of the board and Superintendent Webster
and his deputies have been invited to at
tend. As 250 families have been directly
affected by the'decision of the board a
large attendance is expected.
Superintendent Webster received the
following enrollment yesterday from Miss
Alice Stincen, principal of the Pacific
Heights School: . Â¦ â¢
Advanced eighth grade, B5 pupils: advanced
eighth 25 and eighth 25,- total 50 pupils; eighth
65, eighth 25. seventh 27, tdtal 62 pupils; seventh
65, seventh 55 pupils: seventh 30. sixth 23, total
53 pupils: sixth 65. sixth 55 pupils; sixth 65
pupils; fifth 55 pupils; fifth 43. fourth 10. total
C3 pupils; fourth 45. third 7. total Â£2 pupils;
third 53 pupils; second 50 pupils; first 51 pupils.
Mr. Webster says that the enrollment
aggregates 8o4 pupils, which is largely in
excess of the accommodations of the
school, i There are but fourteen class
rooms in the school and to accommodate
sixteen classes, as shown by the returns
t)f Miss Stincen, will necessitate the use
of a dark room in the basement and a
room now utilized a3 a cloak room by
teachers and pupils. Mr. Webster says
that the school will only accommodate
750 pupils comfortably.
It was reported around the district last
evening that the order of the board had,
in a measure, been rescinded, and that
primary pupils would again bo allowed
into the Pacific Heights Schools. Director
Denman denied the report, however, and
said that the district would quiet down In
time and the trouble would end. \ v

Much Government Beef Condemned.
Policeman Butterworth, who is detailed

Charles Scheper will appear to-day be
fore the Supreme Court on a writ of ha
beas corpus. The question to be decided
Is whether a Judge of the Superior Court
can commit a man to prison for an
indefinite period because of his inability
to pay alimony. Scheper is suing his wif-j,
Lizzie, for a divorce, and Superior Judge
Dunne ordered the husband to pay the
wife $55 as alimony and counsel fees. In
default of complying with the order
Scheper was committed to the custody of
the Â¦ Sheriff until he/ handed over the
money.

ceived high praise by the critics of New
Tork.

now before the public. He is a universal
favorite and is possessed of great histri
onic ability. His last appearance in this
city was two years ago, when, while a
member of the A. M. Palmer Company,
he scored a big hit as the old Southerner
in "Alabama." As David Ives in "The
Dancing Girl," produced by the same
company, with Julia Arthur in the leading
role, Mr. Stoddard scored a distinct suc
cess.

Frohman the three actors . left New York
yesterday and will arrive in this city, in
time to take part in the rehearsal, which

Ordinance Recommended by Judi
ciary Committee â Recorder
Gets Mortgage Cierk.
The Supervisors' Judiciary Committee
decided yesterday to recommend the or
dinance regulating the height of fences
of wood and other inflammable material
to twenty feet, to be in force on and from
passage until June 30, 1901. when the or
dinance limiting fences to ten feet In
height will go into effect. An amendment
intended to exempt fences erected around
pleasure-grounds from the provisions of
the ordinance will be recommended.
The bill repealing the ordinance author
izing the Recorder to appoint a mortgage
clerk was indefinitely postponed on the
ground that the clerk is a necessity.
The bills of Health Officer O'Brien, Dr.
E. Windele, Dr. D. D. Lustig and Dr.
Theodore Rethers for medical testimony
in court cases were referred to the City
Attorney for his opinion as to whether
city officers can charge for their services
rendered outside of their official duties.
FENCES MAY BE TWENTY
FEET HIGH FOR AWHILE
City Attorney Lane informed the Board
of. Supervisors yesterday that in his
opinion the . board has not the power to
fix telephone rates, but that such power
may be obtained by proper amendment to
the charter. The power to fix charges for
telephone service is not granted by the
provision of the charter which authorizes
the board to determine the compensation
to be collected for the use of water, heat
light or power. It must be inferred' that
it was intended' to withhold the power
purposely as to telephone companies.
That the Charter Is Sileut on
the Point.
City Attorney Informs Supervisors
NO POWER TO FIX v.
TELEPHONE RATES
WOULD RATHER BE
POOR THAN MARRY
â¢jp^ROBATE . JUDGE COFFET,
L-si'wlth his usual versatility,
ji devised ways and means
yesterday by which, if
adopted, aged John Schenkel would
come Into possession of a legacy of
55000, bequeathed him by his late
brother, Peter Schenkel. The ad
vice of the court, however, was
Ecorned by the devisee. When
Peter Schenkel died he left an
estate of considerable value. Of
his gold his brother John was to
have $5000 in the event that Mrs.
Elizabeth M. Schenkel, decedent's
widow died or rrarried again.
Schenkel, the devisee, has been
worrying considerably of late over
the fact that Mrs. Schenkel still
lives and refuses to marry. Schen
kel was in court again yesterday
endeavoring to Impress the court
with his views that Justice would
be done to him, a poor man, if the
will of the deceased was changed
to suit his needs.
"Are you a married man," said
Judge Coffey.
"No," answered Schenkel, "I am
a widower."
"Don't you see your way to col
lect this legacy?" responded the
court. "Why not woo and win
Mrs. Schenkel; take her for your
bride and then as she will be mar
ried you will get your own besides
that which is her's."
"Why, I am sixty and over and
she is only 45 years of age," an- Â¦
swered Schenkel in astonishment,
"and besides I wouldn't havjL her
for the entire estate."
"Then you> might induce sone.one
to marry her." said Judge Coffey.
Give some one a 'commission to
nullify this contingency. The best
thing you can do is to take your
case out of this. court and appeal

the deceased. Two months ago Printz,
who was a printer, was found dead in a

following the Coroner's inquest a woman
who said she was his widow appeared at.
the Morgue and took away his effects.
Public Administrator Boland received a

says that if the deceased left an estate
in this city she can prove that she is his
lawful widow. She resides at 20S Central

Two fishermenâ Vincent , Bardolini and
Emanuel Maggioâ had a fierce battle .with
a shark last Thursday night. They were
out fishing for sea bass when the tiger
of the deep came along and got entangled
with the net. After a hard struggle the
shark was killed by a blow irom a
hatchet and hauled aboard. It was
twelve feet long from tip to tip.
Another Shark Story.
Captains of coasting vessels are indig
nant over the fact that an attempt Is to
be made to tow another log raft to San
Francisco by the tugs Rescue and
Tatoosh. Captain Bailey thinks that once
the Mendocino coast is passed there will
be no trouble. The Tatoosh is to tow the
ship John Ena to Puget Sound while the
Rescue will go light. The three vessels
should arrive about the same time, how
ever, as the Tatoosh is by far and away
the more powerful tug. and the fact that
she is towing a big ship will not materi
ally effect her speed.
The last raft brought down lost about a
thousand logs on tne way. These have
proven a menace to navigation and every
shipmaster that has arrived during the
past twenty-four hours has made com
plaint. The State of California had to
keep two lookouts on the forecastle head.
Captain Nieolson says that for nearly a
hundred miles the Bonita was passing
through logs and that a careful outlook
had to be kept by all hands.
Another Log Baft Coming.
The loss of the pilot boat Bonita is not
going to cripple the service now given
incoming ships. The news that a whale
had sunk that smart little craft was
hardly twenty-four hours old before Cap
tain Steve Castle was in communication
with Matthew Turner on the subject of a
new boat. The veteran boat builder at
once drew up the plans and now a
schooner is under way that will rival any
thing in American waters. She will be
eighty-one feet on the water line, twenty
foiir feet beam and nine feet deep, or
about the eame -size as the America. She
will be modeled like the Bonita forward
and like the America aft. No name has
as yet been decided upon for the new ves
sel, but the consensus of opinion among
the pilots is that she should be called
Columbia. She will be in commission
about January 1.

The directors of the Cured Fruit Asso

many of them being either active or re

The association now' includes in its
membership about 85 per cent of the
growers of the State, but in view of the
unusually large foreign crop and the in
qreased difficulties in marketing the Cali
fornia output, it is deemed more neces-.
sary than ever to get all the prune grow

cent remain outside and their products
are sold in competition with the associa

present conditions may prove disastrous.

The Associated Wholesale Grocers of
Ban Francisco and Sacramento are having
a warm tot-to with manufacturers' agents
and commission men. Two la.rse firms
representing Eastern manufacturers do
ing business Is this city have been prac
tically boyectted by the members of the
Associated Wholesale Grocers for some
days These are Spohn & Patrick of Bat
u-ry' street and Woods, Mailliard &
frr.iedel!. doing business on Sansome
w>et. Meanwhile threats have been
Â¦tie to draw into the Grocers* Associa
a wholesalers on the outside. One of
these concern? is the Howard H. Hogan
< Company, on Pine street.
TherÂ«^are several important points of
difference. The leading one Is the fiat of
the wholesale grocers that the manufac
turers' agents and commission men in the
frrocery line shall not sell to retailers.
Another is that a commission of 15 per
rent will be charged by the wholesale
grocers for selling any new line of good?.
There was another provision, which has
l"?en practically discarded, because it was
inoperative, which was intended to corral
the Nome trade for the wholesale grocers.
There is enough hidden mis-chief in the
first two provisions to cause bitter talk
sbout "the grocery trust," as It is called
by some.
Thore are retail grocers In the city who
do a larger business than many whole
salers. Th^re are as many as six retail
stores under one management. While the
wholesalers furnish hotels, restaurants
rind boarding-bouses with groceries, that,
bein^r a retail business, the manufactur
ers' agents say that they do not see jus
tice in Ftoppint? them from selling directly
to The great retail houses. This was the
j- tat that has caused boycotting. The
{i=50*'iate<i wholesale grocers have not
voted a boycott. The method as described
by their opponents is for the association's
brokerage committee to make a report.
Then the members of the association
without pa?sinj? a formal vote, so avoid
ing any evidence of conspiracy, agree to
*"Â«=tan<1 pat."
The retailers of this city have be*Â»n In
terested. While the boycott against the
manufacturers' acents has been ripening
a petition of the retailers has been in cir
tuiation asking the wholesalers not to sell
to consumers. The commission of 15 per
cent on new lines is another squeeze of
the retailers, and they appreciate that
fact. There v.ere rumors last night,
which could not be verified, that the
wholesale grocers were ready to concede
pome points and that some agreement

es' agents concerning sales directly to

THE SAK - FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, AUGUST 11, 1900.
In the morning I awake and find the old
world wife babes and mother. Concord and
Boston, the dear old spiritual world, and even
the dear old devil, not far off. â¢ â¢ â¢ Every
thing good is on the highway. â¢ â¢ â¢ Tne
mid-world Is best. Nature, as we know her, la
no aalnt.
These are not the words of a mere mys
tic or dreamer; they have the racy heart
iness of a man who knows life at first
hand; and they represent well Emerson's
fine loyalty, even In his most visionary
essays, to the regions of actual human
experience. '_
"I gossip for my hour concerning the
eternal politics." so Emerson In one essay
smilingly asserts. "Eternal politics" is
precisely what busies him from first to
fast Man in hip relation to nature and
to Godâ the Hrr.its. the scope and the
promise of man's destiny, man's duties to
God and to his fellowsâ the wise economy
by which the self-reliant man bends na
ture to his needâ these topics and others
like them, which have to do with man's
eternal citizenship in the universe recur
in his essays again and again. And run
ning through all his discussions of these
topics are two far-reaching and vitalizing
doctrinesâ belief in the Over-Soul and an
optimistic faith in the worth of the pres
ent moment and of the individual.
Man is for Emerson not simply divine
in his origin, but a sharer from moment
to moment in the divine nature. ' A3
there is no screen or ceiling between our
hearts and the infinite heavens, so is
there no bar or wall in the soul where
man. the effect, ceases, and God. the
cause, begins." Since every man haa
thus within himself an infinite store of
potential spiritual energy, Emerson has
no misgivings over the present or fear for
the future. Man and God are really con
spirators for happiness and virtue and
truth and beauty: the individual. If he
Is loyal to his inner nature, has all the
forces of the universe silently working
for him. Seen or unseen, they are on his
side. Moreover, every man has his own
quite peculiar relation to the divine na
ture It is to represent cr make valid a
special portion of the divine energy.
Hence Emerson never wearies of insist
ing on the duty of self-reliance. "Trust
thyself: every heart vibrates to that iron
Nature too, like man. is for Emerson
instinct with Deity. Strangely Idealistic
and confident must Emerson's talk about
nature seem to a modern reader who
goes to it from Darwin's "Origin of
Species'* or Spencer's "First Principles.
Emerson Is wholly innocent of modern
scientific theories. Man has for him no
kinship with the beasts. One wonders
what Darwin and Emerson would have
had to say to each other in an hour's
talk Nature Is to Emerson a divine In
vention for man's monition and discip
line and joy. Man has In his own breast,
in so far as he has realized his oneness
with the Over-Soul, the principles and the
laws which run throughout the length anÂ«J
the breadth of nature and bind into har
monious forms and orderly sequences all
its magnificent miscellaneousness.
The world proceeds from tho same sotrlt as
the bodv of man. It is a remoter and Inferior
Incarnation of God. a projection of God In the
unconscious. But it differs from the body in
one Important respect. It Is not. like that, now
subjected to the human will. Its serene order
is Inviolable by us. It is. therefore, to us the
present expositor of the divine mind.
Emerson, then, sees spiritual energy
pulsing everywhere in nature; for him
the miracle of the burning bush is daily
wrought; every object in nature shines
for him with a peculiar iridescent beauty;
and in the presence of nature he is. a3 he
somewhere says, "glad to the brink of
These are the characteristic beliefs and
moods that give to Emerson's prose Its
tonic power. His prose has a note and
quality that we perhaps never find In tho
prose of our own day and generation. Our
day is the day of small things; our age
has well been nicknamed by some French
critic the age of microbes. We pore over
trifles, accumulate facts, strike averages,
and try to reduce hÂ»man nature and ex
ternal nature to their lowest terms. Of
all this scientific pettifogging there Is in
Emerson no trace; he has the confident
and oracular manner of tne prophet. He
believes with Browning's Paracelsus that
"there i3 an Inmost center in us all whero
truth abides in fullness." and his essays
are the record of what he hears as / he
listens patiently at this inner shrine.

and common sense; if he "hitches h!Â»
wagon to a star," he also "hugs his fact.'"
Accordingly, everywhere in his essays we
are kept within measurable distance of
common life, of the actual human heart
and of the world of nature In its element
al beauty, shining with a kind of morn
ing splendor.
Perhaps there Is no English writer of
the present century who gives one st>
much the impression as does Emerson of
being absolutely at home with the "heav
enly powers," the primordial elements
of nature and the forces that rule the
spiritual world. Carlyle in some of his
books talks quite as volubly of the infini
ties and the eternities, but they put him
in a passionâ a passion of adoration or of
awe or It may of exasperation at the rel
ative shortcomings of actual life and hu
man nature. Wordsworth is as great a
seer as Emerson, and makes the facts of
common life reveal as transparently their
inner spiritual meaning, but he Is so often
trivial and wearisome that we suspect
him of not being native to the heavenly
regions. In Emerson's prose there is al
ways a divine blitheness that marks him
as having in his veins a celestial ichor.
"With a geometry of sunbeams, the soul
lays the foundations of nature." "The
infinite lies stretched In smiling repose."
"With thought, with the Ideal. Is im
mortal hilarity, the rose of Joy." These
sentences have Emerson's unmistakable
accent and Idiom. At the close of his es
says on "Illusions" he describes the mo
ments of clear vision that now and then
reveal to the veriest tyro In things spir
itual the beauty and the order of life.
I have more than once had this quoted
to me with enthusiasm by readers who
were obliged to ask afterward what the
word "fronded " meant. In no one, I sup
pose, was the spirit of religion ever more
spontaneous and more genuinely to be
called an inner light than in y\hlttler, and
it was accompanied by an absolute free
dom from all narrowness or self-asser-
Nothing could be more simple and pleas
ing than his home life. Until bereaved of
his mother and sister he lived with them
in a modest little house at Amesbury.
where all the traditions of Quaker house
keeping were exquisitely preserved, and
the perfect order of the interior made the
littie dwelling an equally appropriate re
sort for visiting emperors or for fugitive
slaves. Elizabeth Whittier. some of whose
poems her brother took delight in includ
ing with his own, represented in her tem
perament a wholly different element of
Quakerism from his, being as ardent and
outspoken as he was shy and reticent and
not fearing to .shake her head reprovingly
at the dignified friends on the high seats
at yearly meeting if the spirit moved
them to discourse too long so that her hos
pitable dinner was in danger of being
spoiled. Plain in person, without the reg
ular features of her brother, she yet had
eyes of much more liquid brilliancy which
filled her face with charm during every
moment of her lively conversation.
With less of European celebrity than
several of his compeers, Whittier will al
ways hold a firm place at home as being
the literary creator not merely of the New
England legend but v of the American
legend as a whole, he being the very first
who touched it and made it alive. As has
been already said, he never visited any
foreign country nor am I aware that he
showed any knowledge of foreign lan
guage except when he translated, perhaps
with difficulty, a few simple French
poems; but he read eagerly all old Ameri
can annals and his truth of nature showed
Itself In bis varying or embroidering the
legends very little. Any one who will ex
amine Longfellow's selected series called
"Poems of Places" will see that Whittier
furnished far more than any other poet,
perhaps more than all put together, of the
legendary literature of our country. This,
when combined with his leadership in the
greatest moral crusade yet waged among
ui will be likely to secure permanence to
his fame. T. W. HIGGINSON.

Ho had, in addition, the advantage of
being a remarkably handsome man, with
fine features, delicate outlines and a clear
brunette complexion. He yielded just
enough to the Friends' habit of costume
to wear it gracefully and make It orna
mental. The plain language, so called,
was also an ornament to him. for it gave
a kind of dignified grace to an utterly,
simple manner. Having been a grea-f
reader in his youth, he had a great
variety of knowledge. He told me once
that he always had a great desire to
travel, but that by reading a book about
any foreign country he made It at once
bo far a part of his own experience that
he did not afterward care to visit it.
Without ear for music, he yet made his
verses fairly melodious, and sometimes
very much so: although it was to be
noticed that In these cases he distrusted
himself so that his later alterations in
his own verse almost always iniured it.
He was eminently Intuitive, both In his
perceptions of character and his literary
instinct. Younger writers always found
in him a good critic, and his sound judg
ment of men was always recognized in
practical life, and especially among poli
ticians. Never making a speech, he yet
was a frequent attendant on meetings of
the so called "Liberty party." and after
ward, although more rarely, of the Re
publican; and professional politicians,
habitually distrustful of literary men

ways rather silken clad, while Emerson s
stralnsx are constantly abstruse, and
those of Lowell and Holmes are often In
volved and complex. Sprung from the
people, Whittier was thus emphatically
the poet of the people. Yet it is to be no
ticed that some of the lines of tenest quot
ed from his volumes are those in which
his strain Is at the highest. Chief among
these perhaps is that fine verse on im
mortality, almost approaching the charac
ter of a hymn, where he says;
I know not where His islands lift
Their fronded palms In air;
I only know I cannot drift
Beyond his love and care.
Apart from the genius and philanthropy
of the poet Whittier, his career will al
ways be an Interesting test of the work
ing of republican institutions. He be
longed to a circle of men all whose lead
ers except himself were in a manner born
in the purple, by comparison. They might
have known poverty, but they were all of
what Holmes called "the Brahmin blood."
They and their fathers before them were
college bred and had whatever that rep
resents in New England. In a country
like England a man like Whittier, bred
to farming in summer -and shoemaklngr
in winter, would have been at a disadvan
tage among these men in a degree which
the efforts of a lifetime would scarcely
have effaced, i He' being what he was and
living in America, the distinction effaced
itself; no one thought of it. There was no
such thing as patronizing or deference; he
simply took his place. Yet It Is but just
also to recall that he was bred in the so
ciety of Friends, which furnished a
Brahmin blood of its ownâ a" body which
has been in all generations separated
from the world's people by a purity, such
as was almost equivalent to refinement,
and by a habit of religious equality wnich
Ignored the world's trivial differences.
Certain It is that in the democracy of let
ters, there has never been a man .who
took his place with more absolute com

XEW TORK. Aug. 10.â Yesterday's dead
level of stagnation in stocks was slightly re
lieved by one or two features In to-day's mar
ket. The strength In special cases had a sym
pathetic effect In the narrow general market
and earlier weakness was overcome, but the
i advance generally stopped short at about last
night's levei. The exception was Sugar, which
ruled above last night's level all day on opera
tions by recent bull managers In the stock.
There was no news to explain the movement,
but the stock became fairly active in the lat
ter part of the day and rose 2*g over last night,
with which price it closed. Hrooklyn Transit
was Inclined to advance on renewed promises
of change in the control of active management.
Thfre was continued buying of Chicago and
Northwestern after a slight preliminary re
action, the stock rising 1?j over last night,
while the preferred gained 2\i over the last
sale on a single transaction. The buying order
in the stock is said to be for investment ac
count, based on the financial strength exhib
ited by the company in its annual statement.
Efforts were made to' check the downward
movement in National Lead preferred by au
thorized denial of yesterday's rumors that a
bond Issue is Imminent, but the stock slumped
badly in the last hour, falling an extreme 4VÂ»
points, while th? common stock dropped 1 from
the best. St. Paul was sold down a sharp
fraction In the morning on large decrease in
gross earnings reported for the first week In
August. The stock recovered and was about
unchanged at the close. The engagement of
gold for export to-morrow, which amounted to
13,250,000, seemed to be without effect on the
Bentiment. perhaps because the amount will
not figure in to-morrow's bank statement. The
exports were due to the advance in the Bank
of England's price for gold bars and American
eagles, which made shipments feasible In spit*
of a fractional decline In sterling exchange.
None of thÂ» engagements were due to syndi
cate operations for payment of the British
bond subscriptions. The outward demand of
gold for the week Is thus brought to ovjr
W. 000. M0, only J5.300.C00 of which will figure in
the bank statement. Including the payments by
the banks for this amount of the gold ex
ported and allowing for payments by the sub
trea^ury of drafts for gold deposited at Pa
cinc Coast points, the banks have lost to thai
institution J2.160.OG0.
There was nothing of Importance In the bond
market. Total sales, par value, 1555,000. Â¦
United States refunding 2s, when Issued, the
3s and old and new 4s declined li and the

Â¦"Tl;e local wool market shews some signs of
Improvement. A pood deal of Â¦wool has been
telling at fair prices. The Eastern market is
a!so reported stronger with larger sales, with
prices from 20 to SO per cent Icwer than pre
vailed in l>eo<?ml>er last, but still from 60 to 75
p>er cent higher than in 1MÂ»6. There are sev
eral reasons for the wool market bting so dull
during the last seven months. The principal
ones. are. that manufacturers bought heavily
Jn tftf spring of liSl', when wools were low. and
lollowed up the market until they had nearly
a vrar'n supply of \v<x>I in th-Mr mills; European
markets advanced more than those of the
I'r.itfd States, owing to the belief that there
would not lÂ« enough fine wools to go around;
when the heavyweight season opened goods
Â¦u-^re In strong demand, but principally the
chear>er kind. The manufacturers usÂ«d from
M to 75 p*r cer.t of cotton and shoddy In their
fabrics and the coarser grades cf wool, which
werÂ»r lrr.portied as carpet wrjols under a duty
cf 4 cent* r*r pound. The South African war
and ottisr '"^Itical complications demoral!zÂ»d
European trade so much that the market
dropped (rcrn S't to 4" per cent, making It pos
fi! If for crossbred wools to be Imported to
this country, and a great deal more fine wool
showed up than was expected.
"The Importation of wool during the fiscal
year ending June 30. 1900, according to the state
ment of the Treasury Department, amounted
to l^o.SlS.4^5 pounds, comprising:
'â¢Class 1â Duty lie per Â»>.. 37.404.243 lbÂ«. ; class
2. duty 12c per lb.. 12.631,223 Ibe. ; claee 3, duty
4c r*r iv^ lC:,,tT2,92S U-s.
"The Importation In Class 3. known as carpet
wool, has been especially large. This is un-
QUPstlonably due to the Increased uÂ»e of car
pet wools in place of strictly clothing wools in
the manufacture of fabrics for men's and
Women's wear.
*The total importation of manufactured wool
en poods for the fiscal yoar ending: June 30. 1900.
ver^ valued only at IHLMUSL. whereas in 18S6
ttey were valued at ?:3.4!Â»4,4C0. and In 1S97 at
J4S,162.S?2. In 1S56 and 1M>7 goods were worth at
hast from l<) to 60 rxÂ»r cent loss than they are
now. In 18S6 the wool importation amounted
to C3n.:'11.4T3 pounds, and in 1SP7 to 3jfl 0C2 C6
pounds; 1SSS. to Â»2,nS,aca pounds, and In 1S99.
to Te.rscr'S pounds.
"As to the outlook for the future of the wool
market, it is at: guewwork. This being a

NEW TORK, Aug. 10.â R. G. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade will say:
Progress has been made toward a more
stable position of business, with a few more
heavy contracts to- hold the ground already
gained; but for a proper Interpretation of the
week's results, one must look beyond Wall
street operations, where more than any other
quarter, the vacation season is leaving its im
press of Inactivity. Speculation is cautious,
but investment holdings are being increased
rather than diminished and operators cannot
see that their hesitation on the ground of poll
tics is echoed any more In general business
circles than two- months ago.
Small change appears in railroad stocks, in
dustrials are $1 higher and traction Issues a
shade lower. Working forces are smaller and
will soon be further reduced, probably for .three
weeks, by the eloping down of cotton mills In
New England, which has been delayed longer
than expected: but our strength Is evidence to
the world by the oversubscription here of the
new British loan of Â£10,COO,000 on about a 3%
per cent basis, of which over half is allotted
to the American applicants.
London sales of 40,000 shares of stocks and
some bonds, and American purchases of the
new foreign loan, explain why gold goes out
In the face of foreign commerce returns, which
show for New York alcne for the week an ex.
cess of exnerts over imports of more than $3,
000,000. Exports' for the week of $12,763,719 were
more than double those of the some period of
189S, and for the year the gain is over J8.j,000,0CO,
while imports gain only $20,000,000. The money
market Is untroubled by financing of the for
eign loan, though the volume of new commer
cial loans 1"? well sustained.
Cotton fell so eharply that somfi recovery oc
curred In an oversold speculative market and
ppot rold at 10c' when the official report'ap
peared, notwithstanding many indications of
further reduction In consumption. Wheat ad
vanced about a cent, helped by poor foreign
crop reports. The domestic outlook Is fairly
cheerful and farmers have marketed freely.
Receipts at interior cities aggregated 6.2S7.5S1
bushels, against 3.91S.216 last year, and 2.44"6.
417 bushels In 1S9S. Exports from Atlantic ports
wen? only 1.720.9G3 bushelsâ wheat and flour In
cludedâ against 2,503,344 bushels last year, al
though purchases on foreign account were
large and promise an Increased movement
hereafter.
Corn pains 2c with the aid of dry weather
reports and is 8c above the price at this time
lastÂ« year. Both receipts nnd exports for the
week fell more than a million bushels below
the same week in 1S90. Improvement is slow in
boots and shoes, with only a small percentage
of Eastern shoe factories at work. The textile
markets have been free from such features as.
marked recent divisions of prices, but price
is of fair volume. Ix>ss of the Chinese market
has put ccarse brown cottons in a bad position,
other grades being less seriously affected. In
wÂ»olen goods reorders are not up to expecta
tions.
Manufacturers show more interest in the
wool market, taking fair quantities and seek
ing fewer concessions. The tone is firmer,
thoueh prices are unchanged.
Failures for the week were 177 In the United
Statep, against 126 last year, and 23 in Canada,
against 29 last year.
Â¦lightweight", season has opened with prices
-'4Â® 10 per cent higher than a year ago, and
much depends on the attitude- of buyers in
guiding manufacturers as to purchases ; of raw
material. While the dry goods- demand as a
whole is still classed as backward for the sea
son, the hot weather is credited with some of
the responsibility, and the trade attitude as a
rule Is one of hopeful expectancy. ,
An Immense business in steel products is re
ported booked at Plttsburg and Chicago, and
steel bars are really firmer with an advance of
J4 per ton announced by "Western manufactur
ers,'who have sold their output up to the close
of the year. Piglron is still rather neglected,
but Inquiry f C r this material Is really better
at the South, largely on export account and fur
nace shut-downs are so numerous as to Indi
cate an adeauatC*reallzation of the fact that
the root of the evil is In the output of crude
material. Current production Is claimed to be
the lightest for more than a year past and fur
ther announcements of shut-downs are sched
uled as far ahead as September 1. A signifi
cant feature of the trade Is the strength of
structural material. A large quantity of ma
terial is reported npeded for railroad renewals,
hut steel rails are also nominally unchanged at
$33 iÂ»r ton. The other metals are dull and tin j

half hour's trading the market became very
dull, with the price fluctuating lazily between

of scalpers. - The tone kept fairly steady to

1113 Broadway. Aug. 10.
Oakland Offlce San Francisco Call,
Because he persisted In burning news
papers on the floor of his room to keep
warm John E. Shreck, an aged German,
wlio lived for a number of years in a
lodging-house at 462 Ninth street, was
taken Into custody to-day on suspicion of
insanity. He Is confined In the ward for
the insane and will be examined to-mor
row.
A. S. Edgerly. proprietor of the house
â¢where Shreck roomed, lodged the com
plaint against the old man. He stated
that several days ago Shreck built a fire
on the floor of his room composed of news
papers, and after saturating - them Â¦with
coal oil applied a match. When the door of
the room was burst open the flames had
eaten through the carpet and some dlfll
culty was experienced In extinguishing:
them. But for the,timely discovery of
the fire the building 'would have been de
stroyed.
While the fire blazed merrily Shreck lay
nude upon the fionr. and when asked why
he acted so strangely said that he was
trying to keep warm.
On several occasions, according: to the
landlord, the old man has turned on the
gas. but each time was discovered before
he had Inhaled much of the deadly fluid.
This morning Shreck was found lying on
the floor of his room too weak to arise.
Shreck was at one time a wealthy dry
goods merchant. With the exception of
a niece. Mrs. Agnes Kaelin of 1320 Eighth

charged by his uncle. John Stewart, with
having misappropriated $350 Intrusted to
his care. The charge is made In a suit
filed by John Stewart, the uncle, against
Robert Kuerzel.
After the failure of John K. Stewart.
a Berkeley grocer, the ex-collector was
elected assignee by the creditors. John
Stewart, the present plaintiff, and Rob
ert Kuerzel became his bondsmen In the
sum of J10.000 each.
When the affairs of the insolvent had
been settled up JD50 remained for the cred
itors, but when claims amounting to
$731 33 were presented Bondsman Stewart
stated that his nephew had decamped with
the money which was in his hands as as
signee. Stewart alleges that an agree
ment was then made between Kuerzel and
himself whereby each bondsman was to
stand liable for half of the creditors' to
tal claims. With this understanding the
elder Stewart settled bills amounting to
$731 35. In his complaint he states that
Kuerzel has refused to pay his portion
and Is therefore sued for $363 68.

Business will be livelier now among the
real estate men, vacation being over. The
outlook is good in all respects. Money is
plentiful; large profits are assured from
supplies for the Incoming soldiers; man

In the possibility of a clash between the

notice that he will not <je responsible for
any debts contracted by his wife. Laura

Mrs. Bacon says her husband has not

take such action.

WAS SWEENY'S
DEED IN VAIN
Coyne, Whom He Saved
Treading the Down
. ward "Path.
IT is not two months since
Michael Coyne was carried from
his burning house on Tenth
street at the cost of the life of
Foreman John Sweeney. . He was
drunk then. He was drunk again
last night, when he fell from- a
wagon on the corner of Ninth and
Bryant, streets and received an ugly
wound on the head.
It r was believed by many of the
more hopeful that when Coyne
found what a fearful price was paid
for his debauchery and at what cost
his own life was saved he would re
form and try to show that
Sweeney's heroism had not been in
vain. And to those who knew and
loved the brave, open-hearted fire
man, fearless and faithful even to
his death, the sight of Coyne, drunk
and almost helpless on his cot in
the Receiving Hospital, was an ob
ject lesson in human nature and hu
man gratitude. /
"With the city's mourning for the
brave fireman still fresh in the
minds . of every one else, he, the
cause of it all. drank until he could
not hold his seat on a wagon, and
nearly killed himself by falling to
the pavement.
LIVELY MATCHES ON THE
COURTS AROUND THE BAY
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
HIS Uroadway, Aug. 10.
Coroner Mrhrmnr.n has won his fight
uith I'ndertaker James McManus for the
body of Charles Fella, which the Coroner
charges was surreptitiously removed to
McManus place and filled with embalm
ing fluid before an autopsy could be held.
McManus returned the body to Fella's
residence, where an autopsy was held to
day by Dr. l^illey. But becuuse of the
i'.Oectlon of the preservative the post mor
tem examination could not be so complete
iM the circuinMances surrounding Kella's
Â«toaih demanded. The autopsy surgeon
reported that he had found nothing to In
dicate a cause of death other than pto
tr.aine poisoning.
"I was, prevented from making a chemi
cal analysis of the contents of the stom
ach." reported Dr. Lillie, "because the
c-mbalmmg fluid has destroyed all evi
dence of poisoning which might have been
detected. The conditions are tuch that I
can only report that the organs which
would be most affected by ptomaines were
in a diseased state. Of course, the action
<>r ptomaines is very rapid, as they are
very active principles ot the alkaloid
variety. Embalming would undoubtedly
destroy all chance of detecting their pres
ence in the undigested residuum in the
ftomach." â
Coroner Mehrmann has directed that an
Inquest shall be held on Tuesday evening.
What further steps Â¦will be taken by the
Coroner with relation to McManus' action
has net heon determined.
George McMaFters. McManus' assistant.
Itcorea the Coroner soundly for alleged re
flections upon him. The undertaker said:
"There Tas absolutely nothing to indi
cate to me that Folia's xrasv* Coroner's
case. I had no reason to doubt the state
ments which Â¦were made bv members of
h<s family. I acted fairly and do not like
tn* â¢nay my name has been connected with
the case by Coroner Mehrmann."

|6PFiCE;^<6iMARKg^^^cl'^; 337Jyears ago. It was while 4 visiting: the Cht
cago Exposition that Vlerboom met tht
young lady whom 'he subsequently mar
ried and who after seven years of wcdde<
bliss deserted him.
OLD MAN'S DARLING
SKIPS WITH HIS MONEY
Mysterious and Sudden Disappearance
of Louis Vierboom's Young
and Pretty Wife.
LOUIS VIERBOOM has: appealed to
the Â¦ detective force of this city to
assist him in locating his wife,.Em
ma Vlerboom, who mysteriously
disappeared j recently, leaving behind her
no word of tender farewell. ....
Vierboom is a tailor, nearly 70 years of
age, and the wife whom' he Is searching
for so diligently is pretty .and 1 fully.'thir
ty-five years his junior.
"When Mrs. Vierboom disappeared from
her aged, husband's home she .took with
her $2000 and many Jewels. The $2030
Vlerboom had saved after s many years of
hard work and the jewels belonged to the
old gentleman's first wife, the love of his
xouth, whom he married in Germany and
had burled here about ten years ago.
Mrs. Vierboom's disappearance was one
of those -sudden and mysterious affairs.
On the morning of the day she left him
the young wife kissed her husband good
by as he went to his daily work and told
him how good. and kind he was and how
she loved him. "When In the evening
Vierboom came home to his supper there
was no wife to greet him nor a' meal
awaiting him. Back to work went the
aged - tailor; thinking that his wife had
probably gone on a visit to some friend
and, had -not yet returned.- ."When, how
ever, the husband returned late at night
after the day's work was over he was
made to realize the sad 'truth. His wife
was gone..: She had taken- with her all
her belongings, besides r her* husband's
moneyand his jewelry. :;
- Three days after Mrs. Vierboom's mys
terious disappearance her aped husband
received the following note from her:-
Louis: Go live with your friends. Emma.
[ Tho letter - was postmarked San Fran
cisco.
The most remarkable part of the wo
man's sudden disappearance is the fact
that she was not known to. have any gen
tleman-friends-and always expressed her
preference Â¦ for - a quiet, , home - life. , She
rarebr went out and apparently had no
tasteY for society. -: Vlerboom. has now
about' given up all hope of ever finding his
missing wife. Â¦=-"-'^%Sssi**<Â«SSS'tep*8fe" ; ./
:.-* Vlt nearly killed me."- he said. "But I
am i quite over it now. I have hoped
against' hope that'' she would come back'
to me. 'We. were- to 'have; celebrated the
seventh "anniversary of,- o*ir ; marriage -a
few. days 'â¢ ago.". For this, anniversary we
had made many plans; chief among which
was an > outing .'in the Santa- Cruz Moun
tains. '-The Â¦ seventh ' anniversary Is a most
auspicious .day in : German . homes. ; and . Is
always alluded , to as the.'3even fat years. '.
I.' felt" confident Emma . would. \ re
turn'to me to celebrate the event, and, so
for two " Sundays running Â¦ I inserted ' an
'ad' in the newspapers, in the hope It
would remind her of me and my love for
her." -
Emma V.: Remember; Santa Crux Moun
tains; you know. Louis.
That was the message Vlerboom hoped
would, reach his young wife's heart, but
the anniversary came and went and no
Emma appeared. Although Vierboom ad
mits he cannot satisfactorily explain his
young wife's disappearance, he Insists
that It is no elopement and that there
is no man In the case.
Vlerboom and his wife, who was for
merly Miss Emma Schneider of Chicago,
were married In the Windy City seven
; FEEDERICK - HANSTED, KNOWN AS "YOTJNQ DUTC.M.X." 1
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ASHLAND. Or., Aug. 10.â Vowing
vengeance on his accusers, Fred
Hansted, better known as "Young
Dutchy." is speeding southward
on the California express.
"Young Dutchy" Is one of the
principal figures In The Call's great
expose of the Chretien conspiracy In the
Sullivan estate case, which created such
i furor along the' entire Pacific Coaot,
and he promises that he will send a bomb
shell into the camp of his accusers, and
that tho explosion will cause the sensation
of the day. ~ " , â¢â¢'
"Young Dutchy" arrived from Alaska
last Wednesday on the steamship Oregon,
ind he left by the first available train for
the south. In an Interview s to-night he
said:
"I received the first news of The Call's
exposure two days after I: reached Nome
City, and I determined to return Immedi
ately to face my accusers. I did not com
municate my Intention to any . one, and
I have no doubt that there will prove the
biggest kind of a surprise to certain per
pons In San Francisco when they learn
that I am on my way there.
"Those who accused me waited until I
was on my way to Cape Nome and then
they made revelations Implicating me in
their dirty . schemes. They . have >lled
about me. They intended to make me
the scapegoat. When I reach there I
shall expose some of those people, and
there will be more sensations, I tell you.
I have been shamefully imposed upon be
cause I was not there ' to Â¦ defend myself.
But my turn Is coming."
"Young Dutchy's" name was brought
Into the Sullivan estate case through the
confessions of Chretien, the arch-con
spirator in the great fraud. Following is
the substance of the statement made by
Chretien involving "Dutchy":
He became acquainted with young
"Dutchy" about the first of 1900. Chretien
said he met "Dutchy 1 ,.' on Montgomery
street one day and that "Dutchy" intro
duced himself as Dr. Weatherly's friend.
He told Chretien that -he had the 'man
Sullivan, for whom- Chretien was search-
Ing, and at once .bargained to produce
him. Chretien promised to give "Dutchy"
a third of what he got out of the case, and
for expenses "Dutchy" ; borrowed $2 at
that time.
A day or two later he brought a man to
Chretien and represented him as Sullivan.
Chretien gave the man a few pointers re
garding dates, etc., and Dutchy, 1 drilled
him thoroughly as a prospective witness.
On the strength of Letner. being the
heir, $750was borrowed from Jake Rauer,
$300 of which Chretien says he gave to
"Dutchy." ,
That is the burden of the tale as told by
Chretien.
"Dutchy" made extensive preparations
to establish himself In Nome as. a sport
ing club manager Â¦ and a' few weeks , be
fore Chretien's arrest left'on, the steamer
for the northern gold fields with, a large
Â¦tent and a complete outfit' for- the open-
Ing of his school of physical culture.'. *.
mRS. NETTIK TL CRAVEN* has
been adjudged an Impostor and
the documents upon which she
sought to establish her claim to
a widow's portion of the millions of the
late James G. Fair false, forged an 3
fraudulent. Probate Judge James M.
Troutt har.ded down a decision yesterday
morning in which he denied Mrs. Craven's â¢
application for a family allowance from '
the deed millionaire's estate for the rea- '
eons ftated.
When court convened there Â¦were pres
ent Attorneys Garret W. McEncrney,
< harlcs J. Heggrerty, Reuben H. Lloyd,
William SI. Pierson and ex-Governor
James H. Budd. who represent the heirs
and executors, and Lafe Pence, counsel
Tor Mrs. Craven. F - i
"The application of Mrs. Craven is de
nied." said Judge Troutt. "My reasons
for denying the petitioner's application
for a family allowance are set forth in ;
the opinion which the clerk is directed to !
lile." Counsel present hurriedly sought
copies of the opinion.
"After I have read the opinion," said j j
Lafe Pcr.ce. "I will file notice of appeal." i
He then left the courtroom.
Claimant's Veracity Assailed.
By no Indirect innuendoes the court as
sails the Veracity of the claimant. The
l:ndirsg 1Â«j made that the relationship be
tween James G. Fair and Nettie R.
Craven was naupht but unlicensed con- :
cubinageâ the relation of a man to a
Â¦woman only because Fhe was a woman '
and of a woman to a man in hope of gaJn.
Even though the alleged marriage "con
tract upon which Mrs. Craven Teased her
claim of widowhood was genuine, which
Judge Troutt questions, he holdr- that "in
the eye of the law" it only established
the Intention of the parties to marry.
Kven had it been lawfully acknowledge!
before a notary and duly witnessed he
botda it would not have operated as an
Instrument establishing a legal marriage
between the contracting parties, "for the.
lr.strument IÂ« equivalent to nothing more
th.'iii an oral consent to become man and
wife."
Under this Interpretation of the so
called marriage contract Jt is swept from
the case and the cause of the claimant
rest uj>on her oath that a ceremony was
)Â»< rformed by a Justice of the Peace at
Hausallto that made her the wife of
lamea G. Fair. Her statement that such
.1 ceremony was ?Â»< rforrned Judge Troutt
ccrclares false and says that to establish
It as a fabrication ne<--ds not the contra
diction or explanations of those called to
refute her story. In this manner Judge
Troutt avoids the necessity of placing re
liajice on the testimony given' by Justice
of the Peace Simpte.n. Lawyer Dunand
cr Politician Sylva. He holds their testi
mony unnecessary, for, in the opinion of
THS JUDGE AND THE WOMAN WHOSE CLAIMS HE DE
CLARED FRAUDULENT.
the court, in the very nature of estab
lished conditions Mrs. Craven's storv of
the Sausalito ceremony must stand as
false throuehont.
The Court's Statement.
"for the purpose of this opinion," says
the court, <# a general statement will be
sufflok-nt regarding the essential facts
that concern the serious question as to
whether or not petitioner Is the surviving
wife of decedent. In 1SS9 Mrs. Craven be
came a boarder at the Occidental Hotel of
this city, where decrdfnt was then liv
ing. She testifies that he then began 'to
pay her marked attentions.' and in that
year proposed marriage, which she de
clined 'on the ground that she had many
ambitions, that she was ambitious for her
daughter, and ambitious in an education
al way. and that she did not think she
would make a good helpmeet for him or
any man.' He later renewed his proposal
and was very persistent In it. Almost
every time they met they discussed it.
She once partly consented to be married
'ns he wanted her to be married.' But
phe was opposed to the way. He wanted
to be married and not have It generally
known for a while, but she knew that
that would grieve her mother, who was
a very strict Scotch Presbyterian. Be-
Firk'S, she thought she could not give her
time freely enough to make a good wife,
so on such grounds, which phc stated to
him. she refused him several times.
"On May 23. 1S92. however, at her home.
S23 Sutter street, in this city, decedent
said to her, 'Why not be married as I
have suggested? We can get up a mar
riage and in a few months I will have my
business all settled so we can publicly
announce it and we will.' She then said.
'I will consent.' He thereupon said to
her, 'Now that you may have some evi
dence of It, In case anything happening,
we will write out a marriage contract be
tween ourselves.' He dictated one to her
and she wrote it, and, according to her
testimony, each of them signed it.
"They met pursuant to agreement on
the street at a certain corner and al
though she Informed him that her at
torney to whom she had taken the so
called contract considered It valid with
out acknowledgment, they concluded to
have the same acknowledged. lie named
a certain notary and they were just
starting for his office when by chance he
appeared near by and they beckoned to
him. The notary joined them and offered
to take their acknowledgment, but said
he could not attach his certificate to it,
because if he did he would have to make
a record in his official book and then It
might become public. She produced the
paper mentioned and the notary took
their acknowledgment then and there on
the street. The decedent requested him
to keep some memorandum of it as a pro
tection for her, but to say nothing about
it to anybody else. This paper reads as
follows:
SAX FRANCISCO. Cal.. May 23. 1832.
I take Nettle R, Craven to be my lawful wife.
JAMES G. FAin.
I take for my lawful husband James G. Fair.
KETTIB R. CRAVEN.
"This writing, If genuine, merely con
stituted a formal consent by the parties
thereto to become husband and wife to
each other, and Is equivalent. In the eye
of the law, to nothing more than an oral
consent to that effect."
Relations of the Principals.
After thus reviewing this portion of
Mrs. Craven's story Judge Troutt con
tinues:
"Hence the story of the contract'9
strange experiences need not be told be
cause I shall assume that the petitioner
and the decedent did consent on or about

Millionaire and Adjudges Her Claims to Be

May 23, 1892. to become husband and wife
to each other. I do not assume, however,
that they both consented In good, faithâ
, a n Is> wltn matrimonial intent.
Regarding the alleged solemnization
of a ceremony before a Justice of the
Feace In Sausalito It appears that noth
v} B was ever sald to petitioner's daughter
y decedent, from which any inference
could be drawn that any Justice of the
*eace had solemnized any marriage be
tween her mother and himself, although
tne trip to-Sausallto was taken and the
ceremony was there performed, accord
ing to petitioner's testimony, because of
a particular desire on decedent's part to
Placate and satisfy the daughter. Dur-
V?? a Period of seven years succeeding
this Sausalito episode, and until after
her petition now under consideration was
Â«/.?â¢. petltl oner made no attempt to
ootain any information respecting the
name or the record of the Justice of the
ac^ , who solemnized her marriage to
a m . ul .tJ-millionaire. a man who had been
a United States Senator and who was
men very prominent in the affairs of this
community."
After reviewing the testimony given by
Mrs. Craven regarding the Sausalito
teremony and the subsequent statements
ana explanations made by Dunand, Simp
ton and Sylva. Judge Troutt says:
An Incredible Story.
â*" tj 16 , U&ht of these circumstances,
made plain by this testimony without con
sidering others in evidence. I do not hesi
tate to declare the story of the Sausalito
ceremony to be a most improbable oneâ
fnV? cr f. dlble one - To establish it to be a
iaDricatlon needs not the contradiction of
bimpton nor the explanations of Dunand
or fcylva. -Â¦.--Â¦ . .
James G. Fair and Nettle R. Craven
â¢ not nav e a common home or a com
mon name. The decedent's home was con
tinuously in the Xick House during the
years IÂ»y2. 1SS3 and 1894. Up to the time of
his death but petitioner was never there,
e\en a single time. The decedent never
stayed a whole night- with petitioner ex
it 0 i ? " the sin S Ie instance when they vis
ited the Park Hotel in Alameda together.
She was never addressed otherwise than
as Mrs. Craven.
Pencil Will Declared a Forgery.
Â«â " Th , e evidence bearing on the handwrit
ing of the pencil will heretofore presented
,,i u Graven as compared with the gen
uine handwriting of the decedent and the
evidence bearing upon the genuineness of
the aforesaid deeds convinces me bevond
aLa ou that lhe pald win and the "said
SV ve rÂ£ "^ wrl "en or signed or dellv
ttâ¢ K*} h % floced Â« nt bu t are forgeries.
Hence the. fact is that decedent made no
Kn??',Â« n # Â£F P^t'oner's support in antlci
h 1 Â°? of hl I deatn - Nor d "Â°s it appear
nrnvi iÂ° m , ade . any clen nÂ»t<? or substantial
proMsion for her support during his life-
riâ¢?Â£ i tÂ«. mornJng afte . r the decedent's
in?hÂ» Â« w t!tloner Â«*<* th e announcement
in the newspaper. She could not positively
say whether she was 111 in bed at the
time. She did not attend the funeral. She
also read in one of the dally newspapers
at about this time a statement purport-
Ing to be a portion of the decedent's last
will, dated September 21, 1894. wherein he
is represented as declaring that he was
not married. But she did not inform the
decedents daughters or son, or their
counsel, or the executors of the last will
that sne was his widow, until June 25,
1596, when questioned on the subject as a
witness before the court. The petitioner
testified that It had been agreed between
her and the decedent that if their mar
riage had not become publicly known and
announced, then the secret should die
with her if he died first, and that it would
die with him if she died first.
"And now. the final question is, did the
relations that existed between the peti
tioner and the decedent as disclosed by
the evidence constitute a marriage be
tween them under the statutes of our
State Interpreted as. they have been by
our Supreme Court?
How Marriage Is Proved.
"It has been held by the Supreme
Court that a man's mere Introduction of
a woman as his wife is not sufficient to
prove a marriage where there la no proof
of a present contract of marriage and
that the parties lived or dwelt together In
the same habitation. And that mere stop
ping together as transient guests at a
hotel during a short journey does not
make the parties habitants of the hotel
or prove cohabitation.
The Court's Final Judgment.
"By reason of the foregoing facts and
the law as thus construed by our Supreme
Court, I am of the opinion that there was
never any mutual apsumption of marital
rlRhts, duties or obligations on the part
of petitioner and the decedent, and that
petitioner never became the wife of the
decedent. Accordingly, the petitioner's
application for a monthly allowance out
of the estate of decedent, as his widow,
is denied."
This, so far as the Superior Court Is
concerned. Is the end of Mrs. Craven's
suit for maintenance as the widow of a
multi-milionalre. Its fruit for- her has
been defeat on every point, and she must
now turn from her fight for a fortune
and fight for her liberty, which this
action has placed in jeopardy.

; A piano should be tuned !
j and cleaned with regularity, j
' When unused for a while, as |
â¢ I is the case during the summer !
i i months, when the house is j
closed, a piano accumulates
dust and moths. â¢
: Now that yoa are back !
from the country drop us a j
! I postal or telephone. We will '
j send out men v.ho are ex-
! . perts in this line. They will
put the piano in first-class or-
der â prices reasonable. We
prefer being notified three
j days in advance, if convenient \
; for you. j [
