May Close Negotiations.
"To this Inquiry the following reply was
sent on the 1st of August:
"'Goodnow. Consul General, Shanghai:
I do not think it expedient to submit tl.o
proposition of Earl Li to the other pow
ers. Free communication with our rep
resentatives in Peking is demanded as a
matter of absolute right and not as' a
favor. Since the Chinese Government ad
mits that It possesses the power to give
communication It puts itself in an un
friendly attitude by denying It. No nego
tiations seem advisable until the Chinese
Government shall have put tho diplomatic
representatives of the powers in full and
free communication with their respective
Governments and removed all danger to
their lives and liberty. We v.-ould urge
Earl Li earnestly to advise the imperial
authorities of China to place themselves
in friendly communication and co-opera
tion with the relief expedition. They are
assuming a heavy responsibility In acting
otherwise.
" 'You will communicate this informa
tion to the Minister of Foreign Affairs.

" "This Government will not enter Into

closa % to actual war .in. Secretary Hay s
declaration that ,the -cWfCuct*"6f the Chi
nese Government is "unfriendly." That
kind. of, language is extreme in diplomacy
and It is only a narrow step between it
and formal war.
The impression prevails here that the
Chinese Government, If It Is not absolute
ly bereft of power to act in defiance of the
Boxers, will accept our terms, and somÂ«
such action la looked for very soon.
Possibly One Battle.
Possibly a battleâ not more, it Is be
lieved, than one at most â will be required
to bring the imperial Government to the
point of acceptance, though In that case
It is questionable whether the original
conditions would bo regarded as still open
to acceptance. If the Chinese Government
now accepts, however, tho United States
Government will be face to ftice with one
of the most delicate. and momentous dip
lomatic tasks ever undertaken. It must
attempt to redeem its promi.se to use its
good offices in favor of China, and In the
present temper of some of the European
powers the greatest difficulties may be
expected to arise In the prosecution of the
attempt. It In the confident expectation
of the officials here, however, that if the
Chinese Government' actually and in good
faith meets all four of the conditions laid
down by the President In his reply to the
Chinese Emperor's appeal for aid at least
a majority of the powers will accept that
as a proper base upon which to cease the
present hostilities and open negotiations
for a settlement. The decision of the ma
jority in such case without doubt would
receive the acquiescence of the minority,
el?e an Interminable entanglement might
arise.
Message Sent to Chaffee.
â¢ Secretary Root said this afternoon that
there had been no developments which
would necessitate any changes In tho In
structions to General Chaffee, or ,whlch
would change the intentions of the.Gov
ernment In the least. A cipher cable mes
sage was sent to General Chaffee by Sec
retary Root to-day, which contained ad
ditional Information and facts which have
developed since the last message was sent
to him from Nagasaki. The message con
tained no additional instructions, but
merely information which he may use as
a guide to his actions.
It Is not believed at the War Depart
ment that an advance has been made aa
yet from Tientsin. It is explained that
the last dispatches indicated a great deal
of delay In unloading the transports, and
before any advance can be made the
troops must have all their equipments and
transportation for them. The Indications
are that the plans being matured at Tien
tsin contemplate a rapid advance' when
the movement begins, for It seems to be
understood that there will be carried with
the army a sufficient quantity of supplies
to maintain the troops on tho march to
Peking and return, if a return should be
advisable.
The fact that no. reports were received
from General ChafTec during the day. was
not surprising to the War Department of
ficials, who said that the general was
busy "preparing for the campaign, and,
moreover, communication between Taku
and Chefu Is uncertain.

A prominent foreign diplomat acquainted with the character
of the country about Tientsin said to-day that If such an act
were committed the only effect would be to make transporta
tion more difficult and thus Impede the march of the troops.
War Department official* admit that at this moment transpor
tation Is the most serious problem, and General MaeArthur
will be depended upon to relieve the needs of General Chaffeo
in this respect.
The disposition in official circles seems to te to believe that
the administration of another defeat to the Chinese forces out
side of Tientsin will mean the collapse of organized opposition.
It was pointsd out to-day that the Chinese have stnee the cap
ture of Tientsin and its partial destruction made every effort
to stop the advance of the allies, and these efforts could oniv
have been caused by the apprehension that Peking would sur
fer as Tientsin, but the defeat of the Chinese troops by tho
expedition sent to the relief of Peking will, in the view of the
officials here, undoubtedly cause an ascension of the peaca
party in Influence.
It Is expected by the officials that the Chinese troops will
make an effort to stop the allies a short distance from Tientsin,
and victory by the foreign troops will probably cause the Chi
nese to determine hot to make a further stand in force except
behind the walls of Peking. It has been noted by military ex
perts that the Chinese are reported to have dammed the Pelho
River. It is expected that when the allies commence their march
the dam will be broken and the lowlands flooded.

Secretary Hay's reply to LI Hung Chang
has closed the negotiations with China
unless the old Viceroy Is able to secure
the full acceptance of our terms relative
to the foreign Ministers, and that at once.
No orders, therefore, looking to the re
laxation of the preparations for the ad
vance on Peking have gone out of Wash
ington, for, as the situation is described
by one of the leading ofiicials here, "there
will be no bargaining on our part in ad
vance of the concession by the Chinese
authorities of full and free communica
tion with the foreign Ministers."
There is, moreover, a note ominously
The San Francisco Call.
FAR EAST SITUATION AS
TOLD BY CALL DISPATCHES
AX advance by the allies upon Peking, says the Chinese
Minister in London, will be regarded by the Imperial
Government as an unfriendly act, if not indeed as tan
tamount to a declaration of war. .
Secretary Hay, replying to the proposal by Li Hung
Chang that the allies should engage not to march on Pe
king on condition that the foreign envoys be sent to Tien
tsin, practically forestalled Sir Chih Chen's objection by
pointing out that the Chinese Government put itself in an
unfriendly attitude by denying free communication with the
United States Minister in Peking.
What progress has been made by the relief expedition
is not known, but it is assumed to be forging ahead.
Friendly relations, according to an imperial edict, now
exist between the imperial authorities and foreigners in
Peking, who, according to the same authority, are being sup
plied with fruit and vegetables, which would undoubtedly be
a welcome change froin the Manchu ponies which Mac
donald reported was their main diet.
Meanwhile the relieving column is assumed to be mak
ing progress, though details are lacking, while what is re
garded in Shanghai as trustworthy information has it that
the Chinese troops advancing northward from Yangtse and
also toward the south may flank the allied army.
Shanghai has rumors that fifty missionaries have been
massacred in Shanhai province.
William St John Broderick, in the House of Commons,
defined the position of the British Cabinet as unanimous
against the partition of China, and as opposed to setting up
there anything but a Chinese administration.
; Among special cables published by The Call this morn

stories to the effect that China has a large
and well drilled army as a result of the
war with Japan. Â¦

General Wilson had no predictions to
offer as to wh^at would happen and could
not foresee any conditions that would

Mr. Broderick thought it was a time

changes- might result from the recent
calamitous events, but he hoped the Euro

tion on which to build a Chinese govern
ment which would insure civilizing rule

Later in the session Mr. Broderick said
that although the international forces
were now at Tientsin they were not yet
fully armed and equipped. As far as he
Was able to judge at present, there was no
lack of co-operation among the command
ers and no avoidable delay. In giving the
daily record of the steps the Government
had taken with a view of rescuing the le
gations. Mr. Broderick stated that on July
C the Government proffered financial as
sistance to Japan with the special object
of relieving the legations. The Govern
ment, he .said; would press forward by
every means in its power to the relief of
the legations. In the Yangtse sphere
British ships and forces would assist the
Viceroys, but must bend their undertak
ings to the defense of Shanghai. The
Government had thought it wise to organ
ize a third brigade from India, in readiness
for possible emergencies. The Cabinet,
Mr. Broderick said, was completely unan
imous against partition of China, which
would be fraught with infinite danger, and
the Government had no reason to believe
it was at variance with any of the Euro
pean powers in that respect. Further, the
Government would do nothing to set up
anything but a Chinese administration in
China. The Government had not in con
templation the idea of organizing the Chi
nese army under foreign officers. What
form the indemnity should take must be
left for future consideration.
Replying to a query by Sir Ellis Ash

to who is commanding the allies. Mr.

HUMBERT'S WILL HAS
NOT YET BEEN FOUND
ROME, Aug. 3.â According to declara
tions made to the Milan police by per
sons who witnessed the assassination of
King Humbert, and especially the King's
footmen, four or five persons wearing
around their necks black handkerchiefs
such as Bressi wore were seen around
the royal carriage at the time of the
crime. After it was committed they be
gan shouting, evidently to increase the
confusion and to help Bressi to escape.
II Corriera Delia Italia says the police
have discovered that a huge plot was
formed in America to murder King Hum
bert, and that his assassination was to
be followed by tlmilar crimes throughout
Europe.
Another discovery is that Bressi last
Sunday entered the royal chapel of the
Villa during mass, evidently with the in
tention of assassinating Humbert If he
were there.
A man suspected of being an accomplice
of Bressi was arrested yesterday at a
railway station here. He had recently
arrived from the United States and will
be sent to Monza for Inspection.
Notwithstanding the most thorough
search, the will of King Humbert haa

AMERICA'S SI AND IS
PRAISED BY .GERMANS
BERLIN, Aug. 2.â The National Zei
tung, In a leading article on "America In
China," says: "If the movement upon
Peking has now really begun America un
doubtedly deserves great credit. Immedi
ately after the first direct news from Mr.
Conger, the United States Minister, was
ceivedâ a communication firmly regarded
at all times In Washington as authentic
âMr. Hay insisted with all earnestness
that Mr. Conger's cry for help absolutely
Remanded speedy relief. It even seemed
for a while that the American Secretary
of State entertained the thought of send
ing a purely American expedition to Pe
king if necessary."
The paper is gratified at President Mc-
Kinley's refusal to accept Li Hung
Chang's offer to deliver Mr. Conger if % the
American expedition is countermanded. It
thinks, however, that Washington's China
policy has been wavering and it explains
this as due to the exigencies of the
Presidential campaign and to the presence
of the Chinese themselves in the United
States. The Kreuz Zeitung has an article
on the same subject. Assuming that the
United States is still ready to mediate this
journal remarks:
"It would be a brilliant electioneering
coup if President McKinley's administra
tion could come forward as the preserver
of the world's peace. With its separate
role the administration would draw nearer
the goal which American concert of great
ness ' is already striving for, namely,
American hegemony in the Pacific. This
goal is not one to be reached easily, but
the prospect can do President McKinley's
party good service in the coming elec
tion."
The papers print a sermon preached by
Emperor William last Sunday on board
the imperial yacht Hohenzollern, from
Exodus, chapter vii:7: M And it came to
pass, when Moses held up his hand, that
Israel prevailed; and when he let down his
hand Amalek prevailed." "
The subject was "The Holy Duty and
Holy Power of Intercession." The reports
show that the discourse was quite belli
cose toward China. Of the soldiers going
thither the Imperial preacher said:
"They shall be the strong arm which
punishes assassins. They shall be the
mailed fist which smites that chaotic
mass. They shall, defend, sword in hand,
our holiest possessions. True prayers can
still cast the banner of the dragon into
the dust and plant the banner of the cross,
upon the walls."
FOR HURRIED ENLISTMENT.
LEXINGTON, Ky.. Aug. 2.â Sergeant
George "Whitemeyer of the local recruit

from the Surgeon Goneral to enlist men
for the Hospital Corps, consisting of stew
ards, wagoners and mechanics. The or
der is considered significant of a hurried
movement in the near future, as the or
ders allow any one to serve who has a
common school education, whereas here
tofore men for hospital service were re
quired to have had some experience.

MURDERER BRESSI MAKES
THREAT AGAINST CZAR
NEW YORK, Aug. 2.â Several hundred
anarchists held a meeting in Bartholdi
Hall at Paterson, N. J., to-night for the
purpose of discussing the situation In
Italy. There ' were many Frenchmen, a
number of Spaniards and a few Austrians
in the assemblage, which consisted for the
most part of Italians.
Pasqualle Frank presided. At the open
ing he denounced the newspapers "In gen
eral and claimed that they were mis
representing the anarchists. He said the
papers made anarchists out of bad men
and pictured them in revolting actions.
He said this was untrue and that anar
chists were the same as other people. -
Resolutions were adopted as follows:
"We, here assembled. Intend to state
that Bressi's deed was the result of the
.present social state of affairs, and there
fore we are trying to establish one where
violence could not be possible.
"We deplore as foolish the idea that there
would" have been or existed a plot in this
city (Paterson), and protest against those
who attribute it to and are trying to make
the Italian colony of Paterson responsible
for Bressi'a deed."
NO PLOT WAS FORMED
TO MURDER HUMBERT
PARIS, Aug. 2.-Muzaffer-ed-Din,
Shah of Persia, who has been a
visitor to the exposition since Sat
urday as the guest of France, nai
... rowly escaped an assassin's bullet
this morning. It had been arranged for
him to-day to visit Sevres and see the
National Pottery Works, going after
ward to "Versailles, and it was just after
ne had loft the sovereign's palace on his
way to the Seine to go on board a yacht
placed at his disposal for the trip that
â¢the attempt upon his life was made
Only five minutes before the pistol was
presented at his breast he was the re
cipient of a letter which warned him that
his life jas in danger. No serious
thought, however, was given to the con
tents, so numerous had been former warn
ings of the same character. As he was
seated in the landau before leaving th
j court of the palace his secretary brought
him a letter dated Naples, but posted in
Paris last night, signed with a name bear
ing an Italian termination. It said
"To-day you shall meet the same fate
as Humbert."
In no wise disconcerted the Shah hand
ed the letter to the officer on guard and
gave orders for the carriage to start. The
gates of the palace were thrown optn
and as the monarch emerged a large
criÂ£ ft ""J- 10 " 3 , Â°nlÂ°Â°kers broke into

Seated in the landau with the Shah at
ort^ ?- the as -? aul t was made were the
Grand \ izier, the personal physician of
the monarch, and General Tarent,* his
Personal aid General Parent, in the
course of an interview, subsequently said:
Jt was the court physician who met the
criminal s advance. It was he who seized
the individual by the wrist and arrested
the movement of aggression for a suffi
cient time to allow the pistol to be knock
ed from the assailant's hand. I am in
clined to the belief that thÂ« man is an
Italian.
The Shah did not appear to be excited
by the attempt on his life, and when the
man was taken away he reseated himself
in his carriage and quietly spoke in Per
sian to the Grand Vizier. Then he said to
the coachman, "Drive on," and the car
riage proceeded by the Alexander III
bridge, where a boat was taken for
Sevres. -
The pistol carried by the would*be mur
derer was of the bulldog type, loaded with
five cartridges. When the. police seized
the man he tried to break away and cried,
"Vive children of the people!"
An officer tried to stop him, but he
shouted. "To my assistance, friends!"
Then he quieted down and submitted.
AVhen the knife was found on his per
son an officer remarked, "You also had a
knife?" to which the man replied: "Yes;
I took some precaution."
"Why did you attempt to assassinate
the Shah?" the officer asked.
"Because." was the reply, "it pleased
me. That docs not concern you."
To all other questions the prisoner re
mained dumb.
The police believe the man who attack
ed the Shah was not alone in his effort.
The whole police department is at work
seeking for his accomplices.
Up to midnight the investigations of the
police had not resulted in any develop
ment tending to establish the Identity of
the would-be nssassin and associating any
others with his attempt, s The prisoner
struggled desperately to avoid a picture
being taken, and he had to be bound han-i
and foot and his head held between the
knees of the photographer's assistant.
The impression is gaining ground that he
is an Italian. He certainly is a native of
a southern country.
As a result of the assault, the Shah will
hereafter be surrounded by a guard wher
ever he goes. I^xtra precautions will also
be taken to protect President Loubet.

PARIS, Aug. 2.â An unpleasant split in
the â¢ Interparliamentary Congress for
Peace Arbitration was narrowly avoided
at to-day's session. M. Dorand, speaking
of the impotence of The Hague confer

Transvaal and expressed astonishment
that the requests for arbitration made by
the South African republics had not
found nn echo In Europe.
Lord Stanhope, one of the English dele
gates, in reply paid that friends of peace
in his country had done everything possi
ble to prevent war. but he said it would
be impossible for representatives of Eng
land to participate in a discussion imply
ing the least blame of England.
The presiding officer turned aside the
approaching storm by calling for a'vttte
on' --'the following resolution, which was
adopted:
"The Congress, acting on The Hague
resolutions, expresses its gratitude to
those contributing to the results in the
turn hope that the powers will not neglect
In the future to utilize the means at their
disposal for the appeasement of interna
tional conflicts and its regret that they
have not been able to do so. Actual war

Judge Smith Hands Down a
Decision in the Long
Pending Suit.
Â» /
Decedent Had Deeded Over All His
Property to a Woman of Whom
He Was Enamored a Short
Time Before Death.
Â»
NEW YORK, Aug. 2.-Justice Smith of
the SuDrnmc Court rendered a decision to
day iinding for the plaintiff in the long
pending suit of May Thorno Brantingham
against Eunice E. Huff over the will of
Joseph Thorne.
Mr. Thorne died on May 4, 1S97. His
wife had died only eleven days before. The
suit was over a transfer to Mrs. Huff by
Thorne of the record title of stock paying
monthly dividends of 5 per cent on $300,
000 and various other property owned by
Mr. Thorne. estimated in ail at some
thing/ like S500.000. In 1SC3 Joseph Thorno
and his wife adopted May Lillian Lee, the
plaintiff, then nearly two years old. The
child was the daughter of Lieutenant
William Henry Lee of the British army,
who had been drowned at San Francisco.
The plaintiff lived with tl* Thornes as
their child from December, 1S63, until the
month of April, IK'5. .
Rich Mr. Thorno lavished all his affec
tion upon her, as did his wife. But one
day, in li>rÂ»S, there came a sudden change.
In the railway station in Boston Thorne
met Mrs. Eunice E. Huff. The Thornes
were living at "West New Brighton, S. I.
The daughter had married G. S. Brant
ingham and had children. She lived In
a beautiful home next door to the Thorne
mansion.
Mrs. Thorne, who had spent forty happy
years with her husband, sued for divorce.
Thorne, then 75 years old, bought a new
home at Sing Sing. Mrs. Huff, accord
ing to the papers in the case, "kept him
.Â«o under control that Thorne was not
permitted to see his friends or relatives
or his wife, and he so continued under the
influence and control of the defendant,
Eunice E. Huff, down to the time of his
death." .
In May. 1897, the old man died. Then
Mrs. Huff produced a paper to prove her
claim to his estate. This paper showed
that Thorne had assigned his property to
Mrs. Huff for the consideration of $1.
Mrs. Thorne had died, broken-hearted,
eleven days before her husband passed
away.
Mrs. Brantingham sued for her rights
under the agreement by which she be
came the old man's adopted daughter.
The case came before Justice Maddox in
the Supreme Court, Brooklyn, and he de
cided In favor of Mrs. Huff. On the ap
peal ho was overruled, and on the new
trial of the case Mrs. Brantingham got
her rights. Mrs. Hun* is ordered by the
court to turn over the estate which she
got from Thorne for $1.

CAPE TOWN, Aug. 2.-W. P. Schrelner,
tho late Premier of Cape Colony, speak

nounced his Intention to supj>ort an
amendment to the Government's treason
bill, which, without disapproving the law,
declares its continuance In certain dis
tricts contrary to the rights of British
subjects. He took the ground that the
amendment wcmld not hamper Imperial
action.
? The occasion was seized by Mr.
Schrelner to make a long and eloquent ex
planation of his attitude throughout tho
war in South. Africa. "If I have been
guilty," he exclaimed, "regarding the In
sufficient colonial defenses, the military
authorities have been ten times more
guilty. I delayed calling out the volun
teers until the invasion of the colony com
pelled it. I wag not aware at that time
of the weakness of the imperial forces."
He vigorously denied the existence of an
Afrikander conspiracy, declaring that
sympathy with the Boers rlld not mean
disloyalty, provided true allegiance was
maintained. Mr. Schrelner paid an en
thusiastic tribute to tho humane methods
of Lord Roberts. â¢

HEIRESS TO THE
THORNE ESTATE
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Aug. 2.â Miss Lottie Gil
son, variety actress, is once more a bride.
This will be a surprise to most of her
friends, and they will be still more sur
prised to learn that her present husband
is J. K. Emmett, actor, son of Fritz Em
mett, once a famous German comedian.
They are ppending their honeymoon at
the Belvedere Hotel, at Far Rockaway.
Miss Gilson coyly admitted to a Call
correspondent who saw her at Far Rock
away to-night that she and Mr. Emmett
were quietly married in Jersey City on
July 23.
"A Judge married us, but I've forgotten
his name," she said. "Maybe Mr. Em
mett knows."
But Mr. Emmett was lying down and
she did not want to disturb him.
Miss Gilson had hoped the news of the
wedding would not get out, for she waa
afraid it might hurt her attractiveness on
the stage. After the marriage she and
her husband had gone to her home at
Pearl River, X. Y., and the next day they
had returned to this city. They then went
down to Far Kockaway for a brief stay.
Later they will appear together in a
sketch.
This Is Miss Gilson's third venture in
matrimony. Her iirst husband was
Thomas J. Ward, who was sent to the
penitentiary in 1892 for setting tire to his
wife's Hat, a crime he contessed. She
secured a divorce from him and then she
married Lem B. Sloss. She secured a di
vorce from Mr. Sloss a few months ago.
Mr. Emmett also has had some matri
monial experience. His first wife dlvorctd
him in 1894 and he soon afterward married
Kmlly Lytton, leading lady of his,com
pany. They did not live happily together
and he was accused of trying to 1 kill her
in San Francisco in 1895. The next year
she was granted a divorce. Recently J2m
mett has bocn playing in short sketches
in vaudeville houses. .

RALEIGH. X. C. Aug. 2.â After one
<if the most bitterly contested cam
paigns <2v<?r known in. North Caro
lina the Democrats and white su

majorit y- of about 38,000.' To-day's election
iJisfra'tichiscs the negro and changes the
St-itc Legislature x from its combination
majority of Republicans and Populists, to
straight Deinocratic, insuring the. defeat
tit Marion Butler for re-election as United

eral thing, remained away from the polls!
The election; unexpectedly, passed off
without :arÂ»y trouble, excepting at a little
tov.n iianjed Fanlson. .' Afire there, which
started in a drugstore wherein was kept

to white rule. Bloodhounds were used.
but failed to find any trace of the alleged
incendiary. â¢. fe : . '::y.--;.\ . .. : â¢Â¦ .'
The election /was for State officers, mem
bers of the Legislature and county officers,
and for an* amendment to- the State con
stitution looking to a practical elimination
cf the negro from politics, as its adoption
disfranchises the bulk of Oie negro vote.
By far the .greatest interest centered in
the fight over the amendment. Many
negroes voted for the amendment. The
faculty of Livingston' College, at Salis
bury, one of the most prominent negro
educational Institutions in the South,
voted for it. The amendment was opposed
by the fusion of. Republicans and Popu
lists, headed by Senators Butler and
Prltchard. There was a full poll of the
Democratic strength, which, combined
with a small negro and some Populist and
Republican ballots, rolled up a large ma-
Jority.
I Spencer B. Adam?, fusion nominee for
Governor, was defeated by Charles B.
Aycock,. the Democratic nominee, and all
the other Democratic . candidates were
elected. The Legislature is Democratic In
both branches. Mecklenburg County, of
which Charlotte is the county seat, gave
3500 majority for the Democratic county
ticket. Every eastern county was carried
by the Democrats, the majorities In some
of them being 3000. Most of the central
counties are also Democratic Returns
from tho west are incomplete.
Democratic. Chairman Slmmonds said
to-night: "I think we have a safe ma
jority or 50,000, and at least four-fifths of
the Legislature." .

Zumwalt Case Get.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PLACEttVlI-I.E. Aug. 2.â This after
noon. In the Superior Court, the case of
the 1 People vs. Isatah Zumwalt, who, on
the evening of June 7 last, near Diamond
Springs, murdered his divorced wife, Julia
A. Zumwalt. his son, Georgec Zumwalt,
his Jnfant granddaughterâ the Â¦ daughter
of his son Georgeâ and who attempted to
murder his daugnter-ln-law, wounding her
severely, was set for trial on Tuesday,
September 18. The defendant. stood mute
and the court ordered a plea of not guilty
entered for him. He will be defended by
Judge Frederick Adams of this city. The
defense will undoubtedly be -insanity.
The clash occurred July 17. â¢ About 5 a
week before over 100 miners were forced
to quit work along the beach at Topkuk
by soldiers, who were landed from the
United States transport Seward. Soldiers
were on duty day and night guarding the
clilt from being torn away by the miners,
who were only too eager to get at the
rich pay streak, which was already un
covered .for a width of several hundred
leet. â¢ Under the condition of suspension
of work the miners were allowed to work
their dumps, which were pretty nearly
completed this week. This -< having been
done, the miners had a consultation and
determined to defy Uncle San and return
to work. The soldiers were all mustered
out on the beach, and with bayonets Ilxetl
attempted to force. the men to leave, but
not a man stirred. A parley ensued, with
the result that thirty or forty miners sub
mitted to i arrest and were put under
guards. Others quickly took the places of
the arrested ones and were in turn them
selves arrested, until tho soldiers have
now more than they can attend to.
A perplexing problem now is how to
feed and house tho arrested miners. If
they are not fed the soldiers are in dan
ger of being overpowered, unless relieved
by the revenue cutters or transports.
This trouble is the culmination of a con
test of the creek claimants of No. 1, of
which there are two factions. One fac
tion claimed to have located the tundra
claim in December last and was suffered
to be in possession. The other faction
claimed that because the initial monu
ments of the first faction were set. up on
the beach and not on the- tundra it was
not a legal location and was lumpable,
which they accordingly are alleged*' to
have done.
SEATTLE, Wash., Aug. 2.â The first
Eerious trouble between the military and
the prospectors In the north this year re
sulted in the arrest of over 100 of the
miners who went to Topkuk, about fifty
miles south of Nome City. The men had
been forced to quit work on the Topkuk
beach by the authorities several dayB be
fore, but the ground had proven to be
rich! and they went back to work again.
Ten of the prisoners were brought to

STORY OF THE

"Ensign Breakfast" a Unique Feat
ure at Pacific Grove.
PACIFIC GROVE, Aug. 3.â One of the
most uniaue affairs ever given at an an
nual convention was the "Ensign break
fast," which the press committee of the
California Woman's Christian Temper
ance Union and the editorial staff of the
Pacific Ensignâ the California temperance
organâ at 10 a. m. gave the officers and
delegates of the Congress of Reform. It
consisted of ten courses, each composed
entirely of such viands as tickle the in
tellectual rather than the material palate.
Borne of tho articles on tho menu were
"business manager's' rehash," "editorial
pi " "Ensign fruitage" and "printer's
stew." Mrs. Clare U. Southard of San
Francisco, chairman of the Woman's
Christian Temperance Union press com
mittee, acted as toast mistress.
Political reform was the main -subject
of to-day's session of the congress. The
opening talk, "Christ In Government,"
was given by Rev. K. St. John of Kansas
City, Kans. Suffrage was then taken up, !
Mrs. S. MÂ» M. Woodman of San Leandro
reading a paper upon the "Qualifications
for Suffrage In a Republic," which was a
strong plea for the rights of women al
the ballot box. Dr. Alida C. Avery of San
Jose spoke upon the unique topic, "Idiot

SALINAS, Aug. 2.â The fire which was
started in Chinatown last night did much
damage. The exact loss cannot and prob
ably never will be known. For a time all
Chinatown seemed doomed. The full Fire
Department turned out, but was greatly
hampered by the cutting of the hose,
which rendered the water supply useless.
The fire was of incendiary origin and It Is
supposed the motive was revenge. Many
citizens here are very bitter against the
Mongolians, and It Is asserted that the
overirritable ones laid a plot to destroy
the entire Chinese village.
The josshouse was the Initial point /Of
the fire and the entire structure was a
mass of flames before an alarm could be
turned in. The building and contents
were valued at over $4000 and are a total
loss The fire soon spread to the adjoin
ing'structures and two other buildings
were destroyed. The firemen finally
gained control of the situation, thus sav
ing the villase from complete demolition.
The whole matter, it is claimed, will be
investigated. .

fight in Buchanan's Behalf, especially
when the latter's friends and relatives

THE Chilean bark Yosemite is In
trouble. She Is loaded and ready to
sail for Europe, but nearly half her
crew is missing. On Wednesday
night the boarding-house owners got
aboard while the master was uptown
and induced seven of the sailors to
desert. When Â¦ Captain Lumbranos got
aboard yesterday morning he found the
pilot waiting to take the ship out. The
anchor was hove up short and everything
wns ready for an immediate start. The
men were not there, however, ami the
police flag was at once set in the mlzren
rigging. Officer Ferguson was pent out by
Captain Dunleavy. but when he got
aboard everything had simmered down
and Captain Lumbranas had decided to
wait until another lot of "A. B.'s" had
been procured before proceeding to sea.
This will mean at least a week's delay, as
sailors are very scarce on the front.
The Ycsemite has. had a hard time of It
ever since making port. On July 12 she
anchored off Powell-street wharf, ami
that night the Sir Robert Fernle. was in
collision with her. Then some of her men
quit her, but went back aboard, again. On
Wednesday night, when it seemed that
everything was ready aboard for an early
start, the runners got aboard with some
water-front whisky and tho consequence
was seven deserters.

IS SEEN IN SAN RAFAEL
Calls at the Home of Prison Director Wttkins
Early In the Morning and Asks
for Food.
SAN RAFAEL, Aug. 2.â A man supposed to be J. E. Klngr, the much
hunted murderer of H. S. Church, was seen in this city at about 7
o'clock this morning. Early this morning a man called at the residence
of State Prison Director J. P. Wilkins and asked the servants for some
thing to eat. He was covered with dust and seemed very much fatigued.
When he came to the house he carried a small stick, which he used as a
cane. He affected to be very lame until he left the premises, when he dis
carded his stick and walked away with only a slight limp.
- The women who saw the man are positive that he answers the description
of King. When shown King's photograph the women were positive that It was
that of their morning caller. Miss Sarah Hunter and Mrs. Hannah McCarthy
â¢were Interviewed by the authorities, who arÂ£ now making every effort to flr.d
the man. It is possible that King in his flight doubled back through this
county and has thus been able to elude the officers who are searching In So
noma and Mendocino counties.
If King is here It is believed by the officers that he Is trying to get to. San
Francisco, from which place he will endeavor to reach Lower California or
Mexico. King would be at home in that part of the country, as he lived there
for years. Circulars have been sent by the Sheriffs office to all the police
authorities in the State, giving a detailed description of Kins and advertis
ing the fact that there is a $500 reward for his capture.
PETALUMA, Aug. 2.â Governor Gage has Increased the reward for mur
derer King from $200 to $300. Two hundred dollars was offered by relative of
the murdered man Church. Posters with his portrait and description are being
circulated by Sheriff Taylor. j:

There were two hours of yesterday
afternoon that W. D. Valentine spent un
comfortably before Judge Cabanisa. He
was explaining that he never gave any
money to Phi: Crlmmtns to protect his
tape game; that he had all the bona fide
stock necessary to back up his transac
tions, and that he received instructions as
to how to buy and sell. Nevertheless, he
was evidently nervous, for his explana
tions had the flavor of fake upon them,
and the "letter" of instructions, upon
which he based the burden of the evidence
he gave under cross-examination, was
nothing more than a tape, which just
fitted the reel seized in his place of busi
ness. This reel had no connection with a
telegraph wire, according to the testimony
of Police Lieutenant Martin, who seized
it. and it was guiltless of any influence
either of the stock market or the wheat
pit. ' It was Just a jumble of numbers, by
courtesy termed quotations, which Val
entine wished the court to believe repre
sented the actual fluctuations of the stock
he sold.
After denying that he had had any con
versation with Rumble during nine years.
Valentine went on to say that when Sam
Rankin, the policeman bought two shares
of Excelsior Gold Mining Company stock
there were 200 shares of the stock in the
possession of the firm to meet any de
mand upon it. Valentine was asked where
he got this stock, and he showed a cer
tificate for the 200 shares, which he said
had been sent out to him from Chicago
by William Seward. With the certificate,
he said. Seward sent out a letter of in
struction telling him how the stock was to
be sold. This -letter" was the tape. The
tape started off with "Please buy or sell
the following stocks at the prices named."
Then followed a series of letters and num
bers, which interpreted, meant the dif
ferent stocks and the prices they were
to be quoted at. -
Prosecuting Attorney Coffey tried hard
to get the method of working the tape
and reel from the witness, but the latter's
position as a defendant protected him,
the court not allowing the questions. Cof
fey is anxious to go into the matter, how
ever and when court adjourned Judge
Cabaniss announced that he would look
the matter up and be able to decide to
day just how far the cross-examination
can proceed.
Valentine Is the first witness for the
defense. It is probable that he will be
the only Important one.

Judge Shaw Denies Mint Superin
tendent I/aach's Motion for a
Transfer.
Judge Luclen Shaw made an order yes
terday denying the motion of Superintend
ent of the Mint Frank H. Leach for the
transfer of the damage suit instituted
against him by ex-Police Court Clerk
Thomas B. O'Brien. Leach caused the
removal of O'Brien from the Mint steps
while the latter was haranguing a crowd
on "British Atrocities in South Africa" a
few months ago, and O'Brien sued for
heavy damages. Superintendent Leach
as the suit was the result of an occurrence
on Government - property, asked for a
transfer to the Federal court. Judge Shaw
denied the motion for a transfer on the
ground that the complaint does not dis
close the fact that the case arises under
the constitution or laws of the United
States. In the event of an adverse Judfr
ment, however, the defendant has a rem

Blackmail Levied on the Gamblers.
Chief Sullivan says that he will prefer

flying about and I made a thorough in

a large and a dangerous field before them,
but their superiors believe that they will

IS REMOVED FROM CHINATOWN
Wholesale Gambling
and Lottern Plan
ing bn White Men
and Bobs Permitted
Chinatown which convinced me that the
squad was not as aggressive as It should
be and I therefore ordered the change."
The conditions to which Chief Sullivan
refers have been matters of common gos
sip for months. Chinese and whites alike,
passed them from mouth to mouth. A
casual observer could see in passing that
the Police Department had either decided
to permit Chinese gamblers and male
factors to have full swing or some pro
tecting influence was at work to allow the
Chinese their coveted licenses to disobey
the law. Common gossip had it that the
Chinese contributed $1500 a week to be
permitted to conduct their gambling
houses, lottery agencies, opium dens and
disreputable resorts without interference.
This Is an enormous tariff to payâ even
for the Chinese to pay â and experts de-
Clare that it is fully twice as much as
blackmailers had ever exacted before In
the history of the district. It was the
very extravagance of blackmail which
precipitated the crash. But the Chinese,
under this regime, had one advantage.
They enjoyed the gambling patronage of
whites as well as of their own race. A
gambling resort in the Globe Hotel, on
Dupont and Jackson streets, was a favor
ite place for degenerate white gamblers
to mingle with the Chinese.
Boys in Chinese Gambling Bens.
An outline of conditions in the Chinese
quarter will illustrate the delinquencies of
Sergeant Patrick Mahoney, who now holds
the record for his lack of arrests in the
district. The sergeant in charge is sup
posed to know the location of every
gambling den in Chinatown and suppress
it. Sergeant Patrick Mahoney should
have at least known what has been public
property for months. He should have
known that during his sojourn in China
town there have been nineteen gambling
houses on Ross alley, five on Fish alley,
one on Sullivan alley, eleven on Waverley
place, nine on Washington street and two
on Dupont street. Sergeant Mahoney
should have known also that each of these
gambling-houses has contributed $10 a
week to some one for the privilege of
doing an illegal business.
Any one casually informed could have
told Sergeant Patrick Mahoney that there
are lottery headquarters on Waverley
place, Dupont street, Ross alley, St. ImuIs
alley, Jackson street. Commercial street,
Sacramento street and Stockton street.
Every one of these places has been in
operation since Sergeant Mahoney went
into Chinatown. At every one of them
every night there has been a stream of
men and boys playing the deceptive lot
tery game of the coolies. If Sergeant
Mahoney had made inquiries he would
have learned that in addition to these
central lottery bureaus there are more
than eighty lottery agencies in the Chi
nese quarter, each with its little army
of white, black and yellow patrons.
If Sergeant Patrick Mahoney had re
ceived that information he no doubt would
have been inspired to Â«eex more and ho
would have learned from the tongue of
gossip the startling information that each
lottery headquarters paid to some one $15
a week for the privilege of remaining
open and that' each of the eighty lottery
agencies paid $7 60 a week to the same
person for the same privilege. It Is really
a matter of surprise to his superiors that
the worthy sergeant did not hear of these
outrageous rumors. He even did not
know that there are scores of opium
joints in the Chinese district and that the
proprietor of each resort pays to some
one, presumably the same gentleman who
levied tribute upon the gamblers, from $2
to $2 50 a week to smoke his pipes ia
peace.
For these and other reasons Sergeant
Patrick Mahoney has been removed from
the detail and Sergeant McManus has
taken his place. The change in the.dis
trict last night was remarkable. Gam
bling dens which have been running in
full blast since the bubonic Board of
Health removed its quarantine closed
their doors. The lottery men had the
stoical, stupid, know-nothing stare of
the coolie. They fear the new sergeant
and expect a reign of rigid suppression
of their business.
Chinese Close Their Dens.
The change was made opportunely by-
Chief Sullivan, as some of the Chinese
gamblers had made their arrangements
to open four more gambling houses in the
district. It is in the lottery phase that
this wholesale violation of the law was
doing the most serious evil. Thousands
of young men and boys patronized these
Chinese lotteries and every night throngs
of them could be seen on the streets of
the district. These white patrons of the
coolies played the game and the. police
saw nothing and knew nothing. The dis
trict has always been a hotbed of gam
bling and blackmailers have made thou
sands upon thousands of dollars out of
the traffic, but conditions never were
worse than they were under the admin
istration which has been so summarily
closed.
<yvj SENSATION was created In police
/L_i\ circles yesterday by the summary
fl ifr removal of Sergeant Patrick Ma
honey and his squad from the
Chinatown detail. This change, startling
in its suddenness, was not. however un
expected. Humors of police corruption in
the district have been flying thick and
last. Gambling dens have been running
wide open apparently under police protec
tion stnd certainly with the knowledge of
the poiice. Lottery agencies have been
conducting their business absolutely with
out molestation; and have been so open in
tbeir Illegal traffic that they have sent
cappers into every district of the city to
solicit patronage.
It Tiras inevitable that this condition of
affairs should come to the notice of Ma
honey's superiors, and Chief of Police
Sullivan began a. rigid Investigation. Chi
nese gamblers, willing enough to pay a
reasonable tribute for the sake of im
munity from police interference, were
clamoring that the blackmail levied upon
them was altogether too great. Chief
Sullivan saw that gambling houses, lot
tery agencies, opium dens and resorts of
outcasts were being conducted without
molestation.
Police Jaws were being violated on every
hand and Chief Sullivan decided that an
immediate change was necessary. He.
therefore, removed Sergeant Mahoney and
his sijuad from the district and ordered
Sergeant McManus to organize a new
scjuad. Sergeant McManus has served
long and well in the Chinese quarter. He
enjoys an enviable record for his honesty
and efficiency there and he demanded the
right to choose hi3 own assistants. This
privilege was accorded to him and he se
lected the following patrolmen to act with
him: James Ropan, M. T. Cooney, Robert
Connor, Michael Brady, David Murphy
ar.d Daniel Lyons. These men will now
cttempt to suppress the lawlessness which

STOCKTON INDEPENDENT,
Now that the Stratton primary law has been declared unconstitutional by the
Supreme Court of the State, the old law is in force, a case of go for delegate
as you please, the few voters ruling the majority, and often the most deserving
being entirely ignored.
There seemff to be considerable mourning over the nullification of the Strat
ton primary law by the Supreme Court. No doubt some of It Is sincere, but
much of it is mock grief. However, there is little question of the publia desire
and political need of some primary law that will permit of a full expression of
opinion on the part of voters and a free choice in the selection of delegates
without the dictation of party bosses.
ALAMEDA EXCINAL.
Under, the Stratton law a man could vote but once and for one party, but
under the old system, with the primaries held at different times, thousands of
unscrupulous men voted at both and were bought and sold like sheep. All sorts
of unscrupulous tactics were resorted to, illustrations of which have not been
found wanting this side the bay as well as in San Francisco. The Stratton law
prevented all this, but it seems that in the good pleasure of tho majority of the
Supreme Court this was not to be and now we must go back to the old open
primary with all its corruption and crookedness.
â¢ Â« â¢
STOCKTON RECORD
Some legil minds are reported to be puzzled to decide what law, if any. gov
erns primaries now. They are alleged to believe that the law Just pronounced
invalid repealed all existing laws. If an invalid law can have such powerâ
which is very doubtfulâ then primary elections will be governed by the sweet will
of the authorities .within the respective parties.
VISALIA TIMES
SAN JOSE HERALD
So far as the country is concerned the members of 'all parties will probably
feel relieved to hear that the cumbersome law is of no effect, for. the reason
that it has never been difficult to hold an honest primary in the Interior. There
is rarely a contest from the country in State conventions, and county conven
tions nearly always represent the voters , of the party satisfactorily. In San
Francisco it is different. There an honest primary was never held, and some
of them have been so disgracefully conducted that a Chinese Boxer would be
ashamed to participate In them. If the constitutional amendment to be voted
on his fall will permit the Legislature to pass a primary law that will apply only
to the larger cities it ought to be ratified by the people.
The Supreme Court has declared the Stratton primary law unconstitutional.
The decision is probably good law. The right of the people to form political par
ties, to freely assemble and organize and^ to take the preliminary steps to put
their ideas in operation is fundamental. The thins to do. apparently la to hold
open primaries as. heretofore, each party making its conditions, regulations, 'etc.,
through its regular organization. _ Â¦ ' â¢
LOS ANGELES HERALD
Altogether, the outlook, for, clean primaries is not encouraging. The fate of
the Stratton law will be deeply regretted by decent citizens of all parties. There
should be no relaxation of the efforts in behalf of the needed reform until it is
secured in a form that will stand the test of the Supreme Court.
The Supervisors are striving to devise ways and
means by which we may have light. It is sincerely
to be hoped that the honorable gentlemen may dis
cover a way in which they may secure a little illu
mination themselves.
Kelly 2nd Crimmins seem to think that when the
Supreme Court declared the Stratton law for primary
elections unconstitutional it intended to submit a ten
derloin saloon as a substitute. Decent voters ought
to destroy that impression by an overwhelming re
pudiation. ,

Old Scandal of Pacific Vineg-ar and
Pickle Wcrks Has Been
Revived.
Charges of fraud and conspiracy against
Sidney M. Smith, late president, and
Charles J. King, one time secretary of the
Pacific Vinegar and Pickle Works, have
been officially made in a suit filed yester
day by the corporation named, in which
judgment is prayed canceling four notes
issued to the order of the Pacific Vhiesar
and Pickle Works by the California Pack
ing Company, by its president, E. J. Cote.
These notes aggregate a face value of
$6402 30, and according to the complaint
were all subsequent to their delivery to
the Pacific Vinegar and Pickle Works
fraudulently assigned to Sidney M. Smith
in his individual capacity for an alleged
valuable consideration by . Sidney M.
Smith, acting as president of the vinegar
works. The plaintiff corporation prays
that Smith be perpetually enjoined from
negotiating these notes and that ludgmvnt
canceling the same be entered by the
court.
SIDNEY M. SMITH IS
CHARGED WITH FRAUD
' H^DUCATORS have come to the conclusion thai !
an object lesson is about the most instructive
* lhat can be given to pupils who have intelli
gence enough to understand it. Therefore, decent
Republicans ought to be well pleased by the fact that
the evolution of events has brought to light just at \
this time two very impressive object lessons in the |
way of political bosses. There is first the man named !
Crimmins, who has been charged from the witness
stand with giving "protection*' to skin game gam
blers: and second, there is the man named Herriu
who has been reported by Collector Lynch as one of
a triumvirate engaged in deciding who shall have !
nominations in the Republican party or the Demo
cratic party or any other party in this district or in
any other district.
They are a pretty pair, Crimmins and Herrin â with
Kelly loafing in the Mint saloon. Lynch in the internal
revenue office and Burns in the distance watching their
game. According to Rumble's testimony Crimmins,
for a percentage, gives protection to skin game gam
blers, and according to Lynch's tall talk Herrin gives
recognition to Crimmins, seemingly without asking a
percentage. : Herrin is a Democrat, Crimmins calls
himself a Republican, and the two are going to run
the Republican party tn this city. They are going to
fend Dibble to the Assembly and Wolfe to the State
Senate.
Old John Randolph once described a famous polit
ical partnership in his time as "a combination between
A Puritan and a blackleg; a partnership between
Blifil and Black George." The parallel between that
and the local instance is not quite complete, for
Herrin is not exactly a Puritan, but it is near enough
to be suggestive. Such is the hog combine that has
undertaken to "run things" in the Republican party,
end to dictate the candidates for whom the working
men, the business men, the professional men and the
capitalists of the party shall vote. .
Could any form of lesson be given to decent Re
publicans that would show more clearly the offensive
ness of boss rule than that which is afforded in Rum
ble's testimony and Lynch's brag? Here is the pa
tron and protector of a nefarious trade getting a rail
road Democrat to help him boss the Republicans of
this city, and a railroad boss getting a Republican
Collector of Internal Revenue "to help him dictate
in the Second District who is to be the Democratic
nominee for Congress. If that mixture had not been
corrupt at the start there would have been a corrup
tion produced in it by the very fermentation of its
incongruous elements.
It can hardly be necessary to appeal to decent Re
publicans to refuse to submit to any such dictation
as that which comes out of the Mint gin mill an I
the law office of the Southern Pacific Railroad. In
the schemes of these men the honor of the Republi
can party and the welfare of the State or the nation
are accounted as nothing. To Crimmins all politics
is a skin game and to Herrin it is all railroad "busi
ness" and the difference between the two is a differ-
No loyal Republican will submit to the domination
of cither the Mint saloon or the railroad office.
Should these corrupt forces succeed in forcing th?
nomination of such men as Dibble and Wolfe, th?
decent Republicans of their districts will vote against
them. The issue is one that the intelligence and the
morality of the party will not shirk and the would-be
bosses may as well understand that at once.
POLITICAL OBJECT LESSONS
PROPOSED APPELLATE COURTS.
BY reason of the Controversy among the officials
at Sacramento concerning the two proposed
i amendments- to article six of the constitution,
relating to the judicial department, th*e attention of
the public is called very opportunely to the subject.
One of the amendments and possibly both will be
submitted to the popular vote at the coming election,
and as .each of them is bad it is just as well to have
voters make up their minds at once to defeat the
whole scheme, no matter in which form it be pre
sented.
The origin of the controversy on the subject is that
one amendment was pioposed by the Legislature at
the regular session and the other at the extra session.
They differ in matters of detail, but the essence of
each is the same. The chief aim is to create three
new tribunals, to consist of three Judges each, mak
ing nine new officeholders, and to empower the Gov
ernor to appoint his favorites to the positions until
the next succeeding general election.
Both amendments contain < the following language:
"Section 3. The State is. hereby divided into three
appellate districts, in each of which there shall be a
District Court of Appeal, consisting of three Justices.
* * - * The Justices of the District Courts of
Appeal shall be elected by the qualified electors with
in their respective districts at the general State elec
tions at the times and places at which the general
State officers are elected; and the term of office sliall
be twelve years from and after the first Monday after
the first day of January next succeeding the election;
provided that on or before the first day of January
after this amendment takes effect the Governor shall
appoint three Justices for each District Court of Ap
peal, to hold office until qualification of Justices to be
elected at the next succeeding general election."
It will be seen that no matter what may be the
minor divergences between the two amendments pro
posed, they present in common the objectionable fea
tqres of adding to the machinery of the State throe
additional courts and nine additional Judges, with
the inevitable addition of clerks and bailiffs and other
court officers, and place the whole of that patronage
for a time in the hands of the Governor. With other
features of the two schemes we shall have occasion to
deal later on. For the present it suffices to call at
tention to the considerations involved in the points
noted.
Why should the taxpayers of California be bur
dened with the cost of three appellate courts? Is the
number of cases on appeal so large that the Supreme
Court cannot attend to them? If so, why is it the
courts encourage appeals on every trifling technical
ity of law, frequently permitting a case to play, back
and forth between the Supreme Court and a Superior
Court as if it were a shuttlecock? If there nCed be
some intermediate court between the Superior and
the Supreme Court, why establish three of them?
Would not one suffice? If we are to have nine new
Judges why permit a man of the reputation of Gage
to appoint them? Has notÂ»the Southern Pacific Com
pany already a sufficient control of the bench?
Whichever of these amendments be submitted to
the people it should be rejected. If both be submit
ted both should be rejected. We have courts enough.
We have had sufficient experience with the kind of
men that Governor Gage appoints to office. Should
he be permitted to name the nine new Justices they
would have a hold on the office which would go far
to enable them to get the nomination for election
and the creatures of the railroad would be thus fas
tened on the judicial department of the State for
years.
The whole scheme is a bad one. It would entail
a waste of public money. It would be a source of
corrupt jobbery between Gage and the railroad
bosses. It should be killed by an overwhelming vote
of the people.
The Board of Health has "filed an emphatic objec
tion to being compelled to "pay for" its" own stationery.
The board is probably planning some new campaign
of absurdity which will require reams of paper to ex
plain. '

AS TO HOSTAGES.
SOMEWHERE in this Chinese business lies
cause for a retrial of Ananias. There are
doubts* about his ability at concealing his prop
erty from the assessor being greater than the ability
shown by somebody, to lie about the Eastern situa
tion/
There is much evidence that the flood of stuff which
has been used to fire the Occidental heart had its
origin among the representatives of the nations which
desire to cut up China.
There is nothing very new nor complex about the
situation. The people have rebelled against the mis
sionaries, in whom they see simply the forerunners
of the division of their country and their own sub
jection to other governments and races. The revolt
has passed beyond the missionary compounds and
runs- against all foreigners. The Government of
China was not able at once to cope with it, and was
probably in sympathy with it, and why not? What
excuse that squares with international law can be
offered for the past and recent seizures of Chinese
territory? How came Portugal in Macao, England
in Hongkong, Germany in Kiaochau and Russia
in Manchuria? What right have these nations to
complain if their Ministers are held as hostages
against the further theft of Chinese soil?
The first proposition to hold a Minister as hostage
was made in France, where it was advised that the Chi
nese Minister Yu be held as hostage for the safety
of the French Minister in Peking. Perhaps the Chi
nese took the suggestion from the French. No one
heard any deprecation of it when a Chinese diplomat
was to be the victim, but when China proposes to pre
serve the integrity of her soil by going into the hos
tage business it is a grave infraction of international
rights!
The plain truth is that the .whole difficulty would
be over in a week if the allies who are getting ready
to advance on Peking would agree to respect the sov
ereignty of China over her soil, to abstain from steal
ing any more of it and to treat China as they do each
ether in the family of nations. The gates to Peking
would open at once, the legations would be safe and
atonement for what has been done would not be dif
ficult. Instead of dping this it is probable that an
advance on the capital will be made, which will mean
certain death to the Ministers, who will be the vic
tims, not of Chinese barbarity, but of the gross greed
and grabbing propensities of the nations they repre
sent.
If the latest phase of the affair prove true, if the
Ministers nre alive and under the protection of the
Chinese Government, it will be seen at once that
there was no cause for attack on the Taku forts and
none for the sacking of Tientsin and that as far as
is known there has been more truth in the Chinese
than the European reports of the situation. As far
as the United States is concerned there should be no
departure from the policy already announced by the
President and extended in his reply to the Emperor.
We are not interested in helping the other nations
steal that country. We insist that the best way to
make China act like a civilized nation is to treat her
like one, and not one of the European powers has
ever given her such treatment. Their attitude toward
her has been so grossly in violation of her interna
tional rights as to make ours seem the very pink of
international comity and amity.
Colonel Denby, who served more than twelve years
as our Minister at Peking, has put the whole case
very strongly by asking how we would feel at being
partitioned, if France should claim New Orleans and
a strip on botli sides of the Mississippi, and Portugal
should take Charleston and England claim New
York as her share, while Russia raised her flag over
the Gulf of Mexico and took what would be left from
the Rio Grande to Kty West? That describes just
what has been done and threatened in China, and
as we would not stand it if we could resist, and would
applaud mobs that would kill the Ministers of all the
countries concerned in our humiliation, it is well to
consider the value of a little policy instead of a great
deal of force in dealing with China.
Your committee reports in favor
of the application of the San Fran
cisco and San Joaquin Valley Rail
road Company for a franchise on Illi
nois street. We have heard all the
testimony of protesting property-own
ers representing about 500 feet front
age on Illinois street, and while we
agree that they have redress in
equity for whatever damage they
may suffer still we believe that the
granting of the franchise will be of
so much value to the commercial in
terests of our city that to deny the
petition would be an injustice to the
whole community. â Street Committee's
report on application of San Francisco
and San Joaquin Valley Railroad Com
pany for franchise on Illinois street.
The Supervisors" Street Committee de
cided yesterday to recommend the grant
ing of the application of the San Fran
cisco and San Joaquin Valley Railroad
Company for a franchise to operate a
steam road on Illinois street from China
Basin to First avenue south. This will
enable the' road to tap the industrial sec
tions of the city and permit it to bid for
5ome of the freight traffic in that local
ity. After hearing the attorneys for the
protesting property owners and represent
atives of the railway company, the com
mittee, which is composed of Supervisors
Curtis, Connor and Dwyer, concluded that
it was to the best interests of the city
that the petition should receive favorable
consideration.
M. Mullaney. attorney for the protest
ants, contended that the company admit
ted that damage would be clone to prop
erty, but that no offer to compensate the
owners had been made.
"This board," argued Mullaney. "has no
power to grant a franchise to a transcon
tinental steam road to use any of the
public streets. If the board grants the
petition it should first see that the prop
erty owners In the neighborhood are re
munerated for any loss they suffer. This
board should not countenance the crush
ing of a few poor people to satisfy the
greed of the combined forces of the
Southern Pacific and the Atlantic Pacific,
two mighty corporations."
A. H. Payson. vice president of the
Santa Fe, denied that any combination
existed between the Southern Pacific and
the Valley road.
"The Valley road." said Captain Pay
son, "would never spend the money it is
intended to spend if it were not going to
compete with the Southern Pacitic. The
City Attorney has unequivocally stated
that the board has the power to pass the
ordinance, and that opinion should be
your guide."
Attorney Stafford, for the protestants.
argued that the City Attorney had simply
stated that the board had only the power
to grant steam railroads the right to ope
rate along the water front. Stafford inti
mated that if the franchise were granted
the matter would be taken to the courts.
Joseph Scheerer. representing the Mission
Federated Improvement Clubs, was
heard in support of the petition.
"We believe this road should be given
the franchise." said Mr. Scheerax. "for it
is a competing line without doubt. The
record of the Santa Fe road shows it has
brought prosperity along with it."
Attorney Preston held that the decisions
of the Supreme courts of all the estern
States overruled the point of Mr. Stafford
as to tho award of public streets for pub-
He use.

Permission to Use Electric Power on
Bush street, From, Kearny to
Battery, and on Fifth
Â» Street Favored.
The petitions of the company for per
mission to use electricity as a motive
power on Bush street from Kearny to
Battery, also to permit the use of electric
wires now suspended along Bush street
from Kearny to Sansome, and to operate
en electric road on Fifth street from Mar
ket to Bluxome and thence to the east line
of Fourth street were all favorably re
ported upon and resolutions covering the
same were ordered prepared.
The petition of the Market-street Rail
way Company to take up certain unused
tracks was reported upon favorably by
the committee. Attorney Burke agreed
for the company to restore the streets to
their former condition after the tracks
have been removed.
The committee decided to postpone fur
ther consideration of the matter until this
afternoon, when the corporation is to fur
nish evidence to prove that it has not
abandoned the franchise on First street.
Chairman Curtis said he was in favor
of tho building of street railways, but he
did not like to establish a precedent al
lowing the Market-street Company to
abandon a road for six months or six
years and then have it operate the road
again at its own sweet will. The city's
rights, he said, should be protected, as
the company had been granted valuable
privileges.
Attorney J. T. Burke addressed the
Street Committee of the Supervisors yes
terday regarding the rights of the Mar
ket-street Hallway Company to operate
a street road on First street. Burke con
tended that the company had not for
feited its franchise on the street named.
Commissioner Maguire of the Board of
Public Works, however, held that accord
ing to the charter that portion of the
franchise on First street had lapsed be
cause no car had been operated thereon
for six months at least. Burke said that
one car had been run on First street every
day, and the original franchise of the
North Beach and Mission road did not
compel the company to perform any stat
ed amount of work. Kdgar Painter of the
North Central Improvement Club said the
property owners were clamoring for the
road. Burke said Bush street and First
street were parts of a system intended to
benetit the northern section of the city.

THE MURDER OF HUMBERT.
WITHIN two years the anarchists have mur
dered an Empress, a republican President and
a King. The school of Nicholas Bakounin
has occasion to boast of its success in murder, but
not in the obliteration of government. The Austrian
empire, the French republic and the Italian kingdom
still live, and the form of those governments will be
changed, if at all, by the will of their people and not
by the act of assassins.
Humbert succeeded to his father, the gallant King,
at a critical period for united Italy. The union of
Italy under the crown of Savoy was really the work
of Garibaldi. He was not deterred by his first failure
at Monte Rotondo, but persisted until # the way was
open for the personality of Victor Emmanuel and the
statesmanship of Cavour to unite Italy and make
Rome the capital. The steps to this consummation
were difficult. Austria had to be expelled from
Venice, the grand duchies had to terminate and the
states of the church had to go off the map. The lat
ter was the most difficult to accomplish, and has left
the most enduring menace to the kingdom.
The feeling between the Quirinal and the Vatican
was turned into a feud during the pontificate of Pius
IX and ha3 not abated during the reign of his suc
cessor. The effect has been to bring to the support
of the house of Savoy the strong anti-clerical party
and most of the socialists.
Humbert has supported the vicissitudes of power
with philosophy." has ruled with prudence and has
shown great address in dealing with the Pope, who
shooses to consider himself a prisoner, confined in
the Vatican and never going farther away than the
Basilica of St. Peter's.
Perhaps no executive of any' government in the
world has had a more difficult; task and performed it
more skillfully. The different Italian States, long
separated, were. not closely united in sympathy. The
valley of the Po and Naples and Sicily are not as far
apart in geography as they are in the origin and char
acteristics of their people. Yet the United. Kingdom
under Humbert came to be supported by. Neapolitan
"and Sicilian and Piedmontese alike and from Palermo
tc Turin there was a cordial loyalty, as there will be
sincere mourning. / ' .
AR. BRYAN said recently in Chicago: "The
Republican party is on the defensive. It will
talk prosperity, but we will be willing to take
the votes of all the people who have not had their
share of prosperity and leave them the votes of the
people who have had their share." The return of
the Assessor on file in the office of the County Clerk
in Lincoln, Nebraska, proves that Mr. Bryan may be
classed with those who have had their share of pros
perity and therefore belongs in the Republican col
umn. His assessment, rendered under oath by him
self, has run as follows since 1893:
$272 50.
1S93 $ 280 â¢
1894 200
1895 340
1896 270
1897 â¢ 1,485
1898 2,980
1899 2,980
1900 4.550
His assessment during the four years that his party
was in power and he was- in Congress helping run
the Government averaged $272 50. During the four
years of a Republican administration, that has run the
Government without his help and in a way that he
said "would write the history of the people in blood
crushed out of them by the gold standard," his aver
age assessment has been $2998 75..
Another singular fact is that whereas up to the close
of 1896 he appeared in the city directory listed as a
lawyer, since then he has not been put down for any
I occupation whatever. We suppose he was working
hard at his profession during the four years preceding
McKinley's administration, and since his professional
income was part of the time supplemented by his
salary as a member of Congress, yet he only managed
â¢to accumulate an estate of the average value of
Since McKinley beat him he has had no occupa
tion, has not practiced law nor done anything as a
regular vocation to even earn his daily bread, yet his
estate rose from $270 in 1896 to $1485 in 1897 and now
figures, obescly indeed, at $4550 ! Â»,
We should say that an increase of his estate by
i nearly 300 per cent in one year under such circum
| stances is evidence of great prosperity. Its increase
from 1896 to 1000 from $270 to $455Â° is something
amazing. It is an increase of thousands per cent and
1 more than one thousand per cent per annum aver
i ajge. Beside it the profits of the hated trusts pale

From the death of the murdered King
Humbert of Italy discord has risen to vex
the Italian colony of San Francisco. Al
ready circulars are being distributed in
the Latin quarter calling for a rrfeeting
to protest against the use of the collec
tive name of tha Italian colony in a dis
patch sent to Rome, which use was au
thorized at the meeting held in Garibaldi
Hall Wednesday night. The colony is
practically united in deploring the assas
sination of King Humbert. It is divided
on the issue of taking the occasion to
make what pome of the Italians call "a
monarchical demonstration."
Only those who were favorable to the
action that was taken. It having been out
lined beforehand, were invited to the
meeting last Wednesday evening. It was
of common knowledge in the Latin quar
ter that Bome. opposition was to be ex
pected if no restrictions should be placed
on the attendance. In fact. Voce del
Popolo. the dally evening Italian paper,
published In this city, gave intimation of
such opposition Monday evening. That
paper expressed regret at tho assassina
tion of King Humbert, but also attacked
the memory of the dead monarch.
"King Humbert," it said, "has violated
the constitution, disregarding tho Parlia
mentary votes and rejecting his Ministers
to suit 'himself. He trod upon public lib
erty. He was responsible for the disas
trous Abyssinian war. He used the army
to oppress thp discontented people, who
suffered from the high price or broa*l. due
to the increased taxes on wheat. Hun
dreds of people wore killed all over Italy
in 1S98 of the number 200 being women.
Many were killed at Prato, the birthplace
of Bressi. The King was never a friend
of the people. Out of his Income of J3.200.
fiOO per annum he did not distribute more
than $2"i0,000 per iinnum. He was repeat
edly asked by Deputy Imbriani to come
to the relief of the people, but he con
tinued to get his 16.000.000 franca every
year He withdrew $7,000,000 from the Ti
berina Bank on the eve of its failure.'-
The article, which wan long, also con
tained the. phrase "our rnonarchlstic fel
low citizens of San Francisco," and pro
tested against making ';a. monarchicaror
dvnastlc demonstration.
This article was 'vigorously discussed.
One result was an attempt to boycott
Vocc del Popolo. Enemies of the paper
assert that 170 subscriptions were with
drawn Carlo Pedrctti, the editor admits
SS attempt to boycott his paper but says
that his losses were small, and that he
has eaned more by the reaction than he

In an attempt to trace the advance
made In surgery through a period of 101
years it will be assumed that the general
reader Is unfamiliar with the work al
ready accomplished at the beginning of
the century, and therefore at the outset
It will be necessary to review briefly the
achievements of earlier times. No portion
of history Is more closely Identified with
religion than that of medicine, and as the
priestly office exerted a dominant lnfla
ence the latter was permitted to take no
steps for its advancement that had not
the sanction of the prevailing religion.
Hence the early progress of medicine was
slowâ slow up to the time of Galenâ and
then it stopped and stood still for twelve
centuries. lAght, however, at last broke
through the dense fog In the sixteenth
century^ a century memorable for the
lives of Copernicus and Vesalius. The
former put the earth In motion and gave
laws to the planets and overthrew the
Ptolemaic philosophy that had oppressed
the world for twenty centuriesâ the latter
created a new world by revealing to man
a knowledge of himself and thus broke
the Galenic spell that had held unbroken
sway for 1200 years. Vesalius in the year
1543, at the age of 2$, brought out his work
on human anatomy and thus laid the
foundation for rational medicine and sur
gery. From him we learn that Galen's
nearest approximation to a knowledge of
human anatomy was through his dissec
tion of apes. The works of Vesalius,
made available by the inventions of print
ing and engraving, soon became accessi
ble to students in all parts of the world
and gave additional fame to the already
renowned University of Padua, In which
Vesalius was a professor. It was here
that William Harvey, a pupil of Fabri
cius, caught his inspiration for the study
of the circulation of the blood, which
finally resulted in a discovery that has
been of Incalculable benefit to man and
has placed tho name of Harvey among
the immortals.
And now an impetus was to be given to
the practice of surgery from a wholly un
looked-for quarter, for who would have
thought that the Invention of gunpowder
would be instrumental in bringing about
one of the greatest advances in surgery?
It occurred in the following manner: The
advantage of firearms over the earlier
modes of warfare was readily apparent,
but the wounds produced by the leaden
balls were Immeasurably more disastrous
than those from the sword. spear or arrow.
The natural inference was that the swell
ing and fatality due to bullet wounds
were owing to the lead, and to counteract
this poison boiling oil was poured into
and along the track of the wound. This
was no new treatment, for the effleiency
of boiling oil and the cautery in stanch-
Ing blood had long been the authorized
practice.
feo well founded was this procedure that
Ambrose Pare at the close of a day
among the wounded in battle, finding that
his stock of oil had failed and that he
was obliged to dress some wounda with
out it, could not sleep from sheer anxiety,
and when on the following day he found
that the wounds which had not been sub
jected to the boiling oil were looking bet
ter than those treated by the established
plan his astonishment was very great. It
was indeed fortunate that this exigency
fell to the lot of so earnest, thoughtful
and courageous a man. for It led to the
abandonment of the cautery in bleeding
wounds and to the substitution therefor of
the ligature. To those who have become
accustomed to seeing a ligature applied
to a bleeding artery this may not appeal
as a notably courageous act, but when
It Is considered that he made the venture
alone and against the settled practice of
the profession, against it may be the posi
tive protests of his professional brethren,
and under the consciousness of the fact
that if the ligature failed to control the
hemorrhage and the patient's life was
lost his own might pay the forfeit, his
act becomes one of the most heroic of his
tory. Fortunate, indeed, that it succeed
ed, for had it failed rejief from the tor
ture of the burning oil might have been
indefinitely postponed. Truly this formed
an epoch in surgery. It gave to that
branch of the healing art an uplift that
placed It at once beyond the aspiration
of the ignorant: it gained for it the fos
tering care of the reigning powers, and
under the genius of I-irrey soon carried
operative surgery to the limits of human
skill.
The beginning of the present century
found the surgeon in possession of the
perfected tourniquet of Petit, the ligation
of arteries, immediate approximation of
wounds by suture and careful dressing of
the cut surfaces, chartered medical col
leges, ablp corps lof professors, well
equipped hospitals, where the students
had every facility for the study of all
branches of the healing art, libraries fur
nished with the best medical thought of
the ages, with periodicals from all parts
of the world and a course of study that
rivaled that of any of the learned profes
sions; and were I called upon to repro
duce the valedictory of a professor of
surgery to his class at the close of the
last century I would put words like the
following in his mouth: "Gentlemen. I
congratulate you that you are going forth
into no new tield of action. Surgery ' to
day rests upon well-tried and established
laws; Its triumphs challenge the admira
tion of the world, and it is questionable
whether the surgery of coming days will
do more than repeat the surgery oT the
present. Finer instruments will no doubt
be made, more Ingenious appliances, and
new operations devised* but the science
and art of our noble profession in our
day will scarcely be eclipsed in the fu
ture progress of the world"." Would *uch
a speech seem preposterous? Put these
words to the test and examine them by
the light of the medical history of recent
war" In the battles of Napoleon the
same, general appliances and rules of pro
cedure prevailed that were employed In
the American revolution and these were
scarcely improved upon In the late war
between the States. In every campaign
mother" and sisters at home haye picked
lint wound bandages and sent old worn
out handkerchiefs and garments for
dressings to the wounded. The surgeons
under Gram and Lee amputated as they
rim under Napoleon and \\ ashlngtonâ
tYed the arteries and brought the ligatures
out of the wound, and In their reports
stated the %1? when the ligatures came

whose inventors will never be remem-
b r>f d the memorable discoveries that have
advanced surgery during the century that
druRV such as opium and alcoholic prep
aration- but no one ever Imagined that
U would be possible for a sufferer to be
rendered Insensible to pain by the inhala
tion ot vapor and to awaken therefrom as
from a dream. Such a discovery In the
middle of the present century soon spread
throughout the entire world and gave an
Imnetus to surgery that was destined to
result In Us taking the highest laurels In
the -1ft of man. Under the inspiration of
tht new discovery surgical teaching be
came not simply a possibility but a most
attractive reality. Medical colleges and
hospitals multiplied and It would 1 be no
PYieceration to say that more medical
confles have sprung up within the last
flftv years in the United States than ex
isted prior to that date throughout the en
tire w-orld. One of the notable effects of
anesthetics Is that It completely relaxes
the muscular system. Prior to their Intro
duction the patient with a dislocated thigh
was first bled almost to fainting, then still
further related by emetics and -finally
BU biected. to the compound pulleys. Now
the surgeon, with his patient relaxed by
an anesthetic, accomplishes with unaided
manual skill In a few seconds that which
often took hours to accomplish before Its
discovery. Anesthetics have removed
hurry and precipitancy from surgical pro
cedure. Formerly it wrfs of the -highest
importance to the surseon to minimize
the moments of torture from the knife.
Hence the bystander often took out his
watch to. count the seconds required in
the removal of a limb. Anesthetics have
added to surgical explorations and opera
tions a sense of dignity, composure and
xrautlousnesa In procedure that was wholly
unknown to surgeons of an earlier date.
A quarter of a century ago a distin
guished surgeon remarked to a bystander:
"What would the su.seons of a former
generation say if they could see the woric
that we are now doing?" I have often
thought of that remark. Would I^arrey
wonder at the skill of his amputations or
Kergusson at this work upon the Hps and
mcuth or Ches3elden. at this collection of
vcslcal calculi? No; but that which would
have surprised them would be that a
spell could be thrown over the sufferer
and during an unconscious sleep the sur
geon could deliberately perform his work.
Truly anesthetics must stand alone as ;i
boon to suffering humanity ar.d in the
coming ages history will treasure few dis
Â¦ coveries more memorable than that Â¦wnich
renders glorious the middle of the present
! century.
Another matter worthy of record ts the
rendering of a part bloodless before a:>
operation and keeping it so for an hour or
more during which the operation can be
performed without loss of blood or tht
obscuration of the field of action by lu
flow. This contribution by Esmarch con
sisted In applying an elastic bandage to
the extremity of a limb and gradually
enveloping it. Finally an elastic belt or
tube was wound around the limb near its
junction with the body, when the bandage
was removed and the limb found to be
bloodless. Such a help when searching
for a bullet or needle was very great.
Still another contribution to the glory
of the century was that of Roentgen in
rendering all parts of tho human body
luminous when subjected to the X-rav.
This at first had an exaggerated and
greatly overestimated position in mediciru*
and surgery. Its value, were it merely. to
locate foreign bodies in the brain, eye and
elsewhere, would be incalculable. Its pos
sibilities in throwing light upon internal
medicine the future must decide.
A quarter of a century has passed since
the lllustiious surgeon asked the question
above referred to. and were he to como
back and revisit the scene of his former
activities that which would astonish him
most would be that the volumes upon
surgery that represented his life work
and which he believed to be immortal
had within a few short years followed him
to the crave. The works of Galen out
lived their author for twelve centuries,
but of the standard works on surgery
that were up to date a quarter of a cen
tury ago not one. as it then existed. couM
be given away to-day. What a marvel:
The Htersrry monuments of a lifetime
swept away almost in a moment as by thtj
devastating tire of the prairie!
Twenty-live years is noi far to go back,
and I recall as it were yesterday surgical
clinics that possibly rivaled any in thÂ«Â»
known world. Small wonder that tha
surgeons breast dilated with pride as ho
entered the amphitheater to receive the
homage of 500 admiring students. Small
wonder that he felt. "What would thÂ»
surgeons of a former generation think if
they could see what we are doing?" Th<>
patient who has sought the advantages
of the clinic is a young man with enlarged
glands of the neck. The surgeon feels thÂ«
glands and the patient Is ..ien conducted
around the clinical Inclosure to permit the
score or more of students within reach to
handle the neck for themselves. This over
and while the patient is taking the anen
thetic the surgeon describes the nature
and treatment proper for such conditions.
Once the patient is unconscious the sur
geon begins. With the first incision blooil
flows, but this Is wiped away by means
of sponges. Does an artery spirt" It is
caught and tied. Finally the tumors are
removed and down deep in the wound the
physician who brought the case to th<*
clinic is asked to put his finger and fWI
the deep pulsating artery. And the result?
Pusâ and this is shown to the class at tho
following clinic as the much-hoped-fnr
result, but it never once occurred to any
one present that contamination couUI
occur from that score of student harr!*
or from sponges that had been used for
months, it may be. and that, too, on every
variety of case, or from ligatures that had
hung for weeks in the dust. Xo; so dceplv
impressed were the surgeons then with
the importance of recognizing the efli
cacy of laudable pus that when none was
to be shown in the clinic it was obtained
from a neighboring hospital to Illustrate
a lecture.
I have spoken of the military surgery
at the time of Xapoleon and said that it
would compare favorably with that in our
own war between the States, but how
about our late war with Spain? Doea any
one recall a request from the surgeon In.
the field for scraped lint? What, it may
be asked, placed all the orders for surgi
cal dressing in the hands of a few largo
concerns, and that, too. at great <"xpor.se.
when it would have been provided l,y
loyal mothers and sisters for the asking?
The answer to this and similar question*
that pertain to modern surgical m^thoda
Introduces the crowning discovery cf the
centuryâ viz.. the source and nature of
wound infection. It has remained for the
last quarter of the century to demonstrate
that floating in the air we breathe, lodged
upon and la the recesses of the skin, upon
the clothing and everything about us Is
life, plant or animal, of microscopic/ di
mensions, which, under the favoring in
fluences of warmth, moisture and con
genial nourishment, multiplies with M
rapidity that baffles human conception
The study of these micro-organisms, their
Â«ouree. under wftat conditions they thrlvo.
the exact nature of their food, how thry
can be excluded from wounds, how rhosr
can be destroyed, how. when th<\v have
entered a wound, their Influence can bÂ»
minimized or dispelled, are the problem.?
that crowded close upon their discovery.
This discovery and Its developments ha*
revolutionized medical education, the stu
dent now beginning his course in th<*
laboratory and with thÂ» microscope: it
has revolutionized surgical Instruments,
operating rooms, surgical dressings atnl
thÂ«Â» technique of every surgical operation.
It has created a department wholly un
known a quarter of a century agoâ viz..
schools for the training of nursraâ an<l
were the *Â»irgÂ«Â»ons of a former genfration
to visit us now it is hard to tell wheÂ»tu-r
the anesthetic, the X-ray or the retinue
of trained nurses with tho elaborate sur
gical technique would astonish them most.
But tho discovery of pus-produeins: or
ganisms has done something more; It has
created a science. Writers of surÂ«rlml
works have hitherto entitled their books
"Tho Science and Art of Surgery." "Th*
Principles of Surgery." etc.. hut never he
fore the present quarter of a century was
there anvthlng In the pathology of treat
ment of surgical maladies that wn*
worthy the name science. The "art of
surgery" haa In every sice kept pace with
the genius of the times and subsidized
every expedient that could benefit the suf
ferer. Not so with the so-called "science."
Its teachings have varied from age to
age. from year to year. Xo two author*

purance of a splendid display by the par
lors of Sonoma County. The parlors will
be accompanied in th? parade by a car
riage in which w54l ride, as honored
guests, two survivors of the original Don
ner party.
A letter was sent yesterday to the Oak
land City Council requesting co-operation
by that body. It was suggested that Oak
land, as the principal city of Alameda
County, should contribute to the parade
pome special feature independent of the
tloat which has been asked of the Board
of Supervisors.
Grand Marshal Costcllo received a let

grand chancellor of the Grand Lodge of
California, Knights of Pythias. Assurance
was given that the Pythian Order. would
assist in every way possible to render the
celebration a success. Chancellor Jeter
has officially requested every lodge In the
order to participate.
Paul Antolne. the Consul for France in
this city, in a letter to the grand marshal
states that the French colony would par
ticipate through the committee whicji had

ebration. The committee has promised an
elaborate national float, on the prepara
tion of which it is proposed to expend ud
ward of $1000.
The handsome poster has been litho
graphed In colors and is now ready for
distribution. During the next few days
copies of the poster will be furnished to
every city and town in the State. Local
and Eastern railroads have volunteered to
assist in the work of distribution of these
posters and within a week or ten days one

CELEBRATION
FOUNDED ON
PRETTY TALE
UNIQUE celebration last-
I | ing three days haa just
Irj been concluded in Chlna
jf Jl town. It was the festival
i of the Seven Sisters, and
w commenced Monday and
ended yesterday. The celebra
tion, which was carried on princi
pally-by. the women and children,
is an annual affair and is founded
on an historic event of the second
century- The festival usually be
gins on the seventh day of the
seventh motm.
According to Chinese history
there were seven fairies, one of
whom was selected by the gods to
visit the earth. She was married
to a poor shepherd, with whom she
lived 100 days. At the end of that
time the fairy was called back to
heaven and soon after a son was
born to her. On the seventh day
she returned to earth to give the
son to its father. The latter after
ward became prime minister of
China and the son also grew up to
be a great man.
Since that day the anniversary
of the fairy's coming has bren sol
emnized by appropriate ceremonies
by the women and children. It is
a day of thanksgiving and general
rejoicing. The women attire them
selves in fantastic garments;* and
laden with fruits and flowers they
visit one another, rehearsing the
story of the fairies and offering up
prayers and blessings. Some of
the houses of the Chinese were
brilliantly decorated. A glad wel
come greeted each woman as she
went from house to house, and in
some places elaborate spreads
were given. There were also dis
plays of embroideries and fancy
articles. The children were given
games to amuse themselves.
The new Kwan Tuner Temple of
the 'Sam Tup Company in China
town is to he dfitficatpd with much
pomp and ceremony early â¢ next
month. The exact date will be
fixed just as soon us the new pres
ident of the temple has been, ap
pointed by the merchants, which
must have the indorsement of tl]e
Chinese Minister and the local
Consul.
The new temule is one of the
handsomest in the city and cost
$20,000. It is situated on Clay
street and is built of brick. It is
40 by 70 feet In ground dimensions
and one and a half stories high.
The god of war is the principal
image In the tempi* 1 . The god
stands about three feet high and
is rnado of wood, elaborately gar
nished with gold. The god of war
is the Chinaman's favorite Idol.

And a single anointing with CUTICURA,
purest of emollients and greatest of skin cures.
This is the purest, sweetest, most speedy, per-
manent, and economical treatment for torturing,
disfiguring, itching, burning, bleeding, scaly,
crusted, and pimply skin and scalp humors with
loss of hair, of infants and children, and is sure
to succeed when all other remedies fail.
Millions of Women Use Cuticura Soap
Exclusively fcr preserving, purifying, and beautifying the skin.'for cleansing tho
tcalp of crusts, foales, and dandruff, and the stopping of falling hair, for soften"
in;;, â¢whitening, and soothing red, rough, and sore hands, in the form ot baths for
annoying irritations, inflammations, and chafings, or too' free or offensive per-
spiration, in the form of washes for ulcerativo weaknesses, and for many sanative
antiseptic purposes which readily suggest themselves to women, and especially
mothers, and for all tbe purposes of the toilet, bath, and nursery. No amount of
persuasion can induce those who have once used it to use any other, especially for
preserving and purifying the skin, scalp, and hair of infants and children. Cuti-
cuea Soap combines delicate emollient properties derived from Ccticura, the great
{Â¦kin cure, with the purest of cleansing ingredients and the most refreshing of flower
odors. No other mediopted cr toilet soap ever compounded is to be compared with
it for preserving, purifying, and beautifying the skin, scalp, hair, and hands. Xo
other foreign or domestic toiltt soap, however expensive, is to be compared with it
for all the purposes of the toilet, bath, and nursery. Thus it combines in Onk

CHICAGO. Aug. 2.â "Wheat opened with a
material decline, initial trading In the Sep
tember option rallying from 75Hc to 75Â»ic com
pared with yesterday's closing price of laKuD
75T8C. Liverpool cables, showing little or 'no
advance at that market, were disappointing to
local traders. In addition to this crop reports
wer3 more cheerful in tone and weather con
ditions were ideal for harvesting operations.
Liberal receipts at primary points added to
the depression. Yesterday's buyers were prom
inent In the early selling, which, however
soon ceased. The local demand ceased enough
to allow some temporary flrmnras to the mar
ket, September advancing to 73%c, but when
the closing Liverpool quotations showed a dt
cline of %Â©>6d the market again turned weak
and from that time until the close of the
session the tendency was downward, although
scalping operations, which made up the bulk
of trading, resulted in several unimportant
rallies. There was but little demand for wheat
until September had declined to a point be
low 73c. when the market again received sup
port, but not enough to cause any substantial
Improvement, although the market became
fairly steady toward the close. September de
clined to 74%c and was quoted at 74Â«i@74% c at
the close.
Corn was wÂ»ak and lower all day and vety
dull. September closed Tic lower.
Oats were dull and a trifle easier. Septem
ber closed He lower at 21>4c " p
Provisions were fairly active and Irregular
Early in the day the market declined ali
around, there being some disappointment over
the email decrease in the stocks. Weaker hosr
prices also had some influence. The close was
steady. September pork 12Vjc higher, lard 'We
lower and ribs 2^6 5c higher. The late re
covery was on an active shipping demand for
pork and sent the price of that commodity ud
sharply and other meats followed, though lard
did not entirery recover.

:closej with' a net loss of %. The opening
â¢price was the highest and was slightly below
â¢ the ' London â¢ parity. The hope of an active
speculation in anticipation of the dividend was
quickly fcbandoned arid the stock slipped back
.into a rut of dullness near tu last nlghf a
price level. ' The action of the directors in
providing for two semi-annual dividends of I
l>er cent'ea^h was quite unexpected, as only
on? had b>-en definitely promised. There was
a slipht flurry an<l some leverishnefis In the
shares as n rule, but a downward course en
sued on offerings of some heavy bl jcks which
looked like realizing. This carried the stock
to. 74*r. which was the low point of the day.
Apparently the realizing became lighter beKw
75, and the nx>m shorts . covered, causing a
slight rally. The holders of Union Pa
cific, then attempted to. make use of the dis
crepancy in the price of that stock and Balti
more a ad Ohio, both' paying 4 per cent divi
dend, and by a few large individual transac
tions gave Union Pacific a place in the active
list. But this movement quickly subsided.
There was some strength in Sugar and Brook
lyn Transit, the first being affected by denials
that the traiie war had been resumed and
the second by inspiring assurances that the
annual report would show larger earnings than
had been hoped for. Continental Tobacco pre
ferred -was raided down ?i. The general un
dertone of the market was firm with some
yielding in the latter part of the day. A
feature of the day was the slightly easier tone

The firmness in cured meats continues and
Apricots rule firm, with a good demand. Pears
are nominal, as the market has not yet fairly
opened. There Is a fair inquiry for Peaches.
Prunes are firm at the advance In New York,
but the local market is featureless, stocks be
ing cleaned up. Large sizes will command a
premtum this year, as It Is now pretty well es
tablished that they will be short, not only here
but in Europe. All kinds of fruit seem to be
running small this year.

Peculiar Accident on the Steamer
BKNICIA, Auk. 2.â A peculiar accident
happened last night at a late hour on the
ferry steamer Solano. Engine 1721 pulled
a ptring of freight cars onto the boat and
the yard enelne undertook to swing an
other lot of cars onto the opposite side.
There was a blunder and the result was
that the freight engine was bumped off
the bow of the boat. Strange to say. tho
tender was torn from the engine and re
mained on deck. At the time of thÂ» ac
cident the engineer and fireman were not
at their posts, and the salvation of their
lives is probably due to this fact.
The engine stood on Its no?e at the bow
of the boat and shut off all traffic acros3
the strait. Af the ponderous machine
weighs 100.000 pounds the company found
great difficulty in raising it. Through
trains perforce went by the way of Stock

Rumors about the movements of the

George A. Knight left last night fnr
Washington to use his political influence
for a fee of ivm.
The fee has been promised him by the
eeventy-four guarding inspectors em
ployed in the San Francisco Custom
house. They work eight hours -per day
anil receive a per diem of $3, Sundays in
cluded. In addition they are allowed a
vacation of fourteen days In each year
on full pay and a leave of absence of Fixty
days In each year upon a proper recom
mendation.
The remaining inspectors in the Cus
tom-house are known as discharging in
spectors. They receive $1 per diem, Sun
days Included, and work from sunrise till
sunset. The guarding inspectors have
made a contract with Mr. Knight to pay
him $â¬0<Â» should he succeed In having their
per diem increased to $4. Should he fall
in this and succeed In Increasing the per
diem to $3 50 they will pay him a fee of
J40H0, and should he fail altogether he will
receive nothing but the $350 which has
been already paid him for his expenses.
In the event of success Mr. Knight's
fee will be contributed at the rate of half
a dollar or a. dollar a day from each of
the seventy-four guarding inspectors. In
the former case he will be paid in eighty
one days out of the extra compensation
to be received by the men.
Mr. Knight was selected from among
the best of the legal talent of the coast
because of hlB supposed influence with
Mark Hanna and his associates. The in
spectors Interested expect that Mr. Hanna
will be likely to assist Mr. Knight to se
cure the tempting $0000, and taat is why
they have chosen him.
The United States statutes fix the com

by as much as a dollar a day in his dis
cretion whenever and wherever he may
elect. Hpnce the pay of inspectors en
gaged in discharging vessels in this port
was increased to $4 by the Secretary of
the Treasury because such work requires
clerical ability, which is not a requisite
for guarding inspectors, whose duty is
principally that of night watchmen to
prevent smufrsrling.
Naturally the $4 men do not view with
favor the compart made with Mr. Knight,
the political lawyer. They fear that the
application will result In the cutting down
of all $4 salaries to $3 50 per day, and they
say that the Treasury Department may
even go so far as to nx the wage? of
guarding inspectors at $S4T per annum,
the compensation allowed guarding In
spectors in Philadelphia. They cite also
that In the port of New York the per diem
of Inspectors assigned to discharging duty
is J4 and that of guarding inspectors is $1,
and they see no reason why the schedule
should be tampered with. Night watch
men, they say. nre employed on vessels
by private persons at ?2 per nU;ht of
twelve hours, without any vacation what
ever, and there is no difficulty in obtain
ing all the men needed for that work and
waeres.
The $4 Inspectors nre averso to having
the attention of the Treasury Department
called to the matter of compensation, and
they have not that abiding faith in the
strength of Mr. Knight's political influ
ence as have their less fortunate broth
era on the nltrht phift.

BEING inspired by the spirit of the
"silly season" and for no other ap
parent reason a wagon wheel ran
away down the bituminized grade
of Stockton street and past Union square
Wednesday forenoon. It was just an ordi
nary wheel from a delivery wagon, but
before it finished it proved itself a "high
roller" in every sense of the word. Just
where it started in its mad career no one
seems to know. When it burst upon the
public view it was Rr?<*dlng along at a
rattling gait and menaced a small army
of white-aproned and white-capped nurse
maids, a legion of perspiring babies and
the usual crowd of Union-square loungers.
Shrieks rose on the heated air. Children
bawled with fear. Nursemaids sprinted
like members of a basket ball team, for
cover. Old ladies out shopping had nar
row escapes from being run down. In
their excitement they dropped bundles.
baskets and shopping bags, which strewed
Cr-r-r-ash! The wheel struck one of the
mammoth plate glass windows. The vit
reous substance flew Into fragments and
sprinkled the interior ot the rug store
with jagged pieces. The wheel's career
ended there upon the Geary-street side
walk.
To the last the wheel tried for a victim.
Just inside the window a follower of Mo
hammed was devoutly readingthe one hun
dred and fourteenth Sura of the Koran.
The Mussulman rose, crying ito Allah,
shook off particles of glass and found that
he was uninjured.
The rollicking journey of the jovial cart
wheel was the result of a loose nut on a
spindle. Henry Barnard, aged 16, driver
for a concern doing business in the Union
Square Market, was proceeding down
Stockton street when the nut fell off and
a hind wheel broke away. He was help
less to do anything, but held in his horse
and watched the course of the wheel from
start to disastrous finish. Several heads
ached yesterday from trying to figure out
who could be held lesponsible for the
broken glass.
the pavement. Bad boys whooped at the
spectacle. Baby carriages were over
turned by the perturbed maids in their
haste, and the contents, infants, nursing
bottles and toys went (town together.
Bounding joyfully onward the festive
wheel gathered speed continually. It
rounded the corner of Stockton and Geary
streets and raced directly for a row of large
plate-glaFS windows in Mlhran's Turkish
rug store on the south side of Geary
street. Directly in Jts course was a
blanched dude, dressed in summer's
gauzies=t attire. RiKht at him the wheel
dashed with the force of a projectile from
a catapult.
"Hi. there! stop that wheel, mister!"
yelled a small boy.
"Get onto his dudeshlp doing the cannon

The blanched dude stood like a statue.
Pie had not lost any wagon wheel nor was
he a stockholder in any plate-glass Insur

me: 'I have $100,000 worth of property
here, but I will buy no more. The women
are ruling Oakland. I will buy no more

do rule Oakland."
Despite his objection the employment of
the matron was recommended and the
ladies won.

THE CATBOAT ROVER
A FLOATING MYSTERY
5OTJTH SAN* FRANCISCO and Hunt
ers Point are mystinea" over a 27
foot pleasure boat that pow lies
among the rocks close to the Chi
â¢ nese shrimp fishing camp by the
south cove. The yacht was discovered
August 2 floating in the shallow water
I off Bay View, arid the wind and tide soon
I had her bumping upon the rocks off shore
near the point. It was observed before
she went on the rocks that she sat low in
the water, the deck being scarcely above
the surface.
Several Chinese fishermen pulled out to
the derelict in a skiff and soon had her
towed to the rocky beach near their
I camp. An examination showed that the
sail was intact and that the halyards had
the appearance of having been cut. It
was no wonder that the craft was sub
merged, for there was a big hole In the
starboard side near the stern, one of the
planks having been torn out for a dis
tance of six feet.
Across the stern was painted the name
Rover. There was nothing in the cock
pit in the shape of oars or boathook.
Aside from the hole in her side the cat
boat is in good repair and could be made
a serviceable craft with little expense.
The Chinese made no inquiry as to the
owner and recently they stripped off the
sail and ropes, which are now stored b>
them for safe keeping. Inquiries, have
recently been made as to ownership, but
to no purpose. The supposition is tnat
the boat got away from some pleasure
*eekrrs far down in the South Bay and
drifted with a swift current Into the eddy
near Hunters Point. No one along the
i water front seems to know anything
I about the Rover, and unless the owner
appears the craft will soon be bumped to
pieces on the rough rocks off the south
shore.

launch, the Athlete. Mr. Scott is a sort of "Sinbad the Sailor" in his pro
cllvitles, and also superintendent of the United States transport dock. Mr.
Knight Is proud of his launch, which compares favorably in his estimation
with any and all aquatic craft that ever have figured in history, from Noah's
ark down to the latest things in marine' architecture, .'and wanted to take
one more spin in It before departing for the East. Mr. Scott shares his
enthusiasm to some extent, and when he received an invitation yesterday to
take a cruise with the lawyer eloquent he gladly embraced the opportunity.
The start from Folsom street was auspicious. In the cargo was a basket
filled with Jingling glassware. On the basket, conspicuously displayed, was
a label card bearing the words, "Whale bait." There were then no whales
In sight, nor when the launch passed the frowning front of Alcatraz fortress
and headed due west, down the Golden Gate waterway.
â¢â¢George," said Harry, earnestly, "I tell you this whale business Is all
a fake." . - : .V-V .
"Yes," responded Knight, his eyes fixed greedily on the "whale bait"
"I'll go you one, George." said Harry, mischievously.
"Done," said George; "it is a go."
The "bait" was even better than they thought. They tried it once, twiceâ
until, alas, it was all gone.
They were then in excellent spirits. George told what he would do dread
ful to that whale. Harry was not a whit behind in valor.
"Ha!" ejaculated Harry, after the propeller had made its ten thousandth
dizzy revolution, "what Is that there, George?"
"That dumgafeted thing! Whyâ that is the whale! The. whale!" '
Bo it proved to be. -It rose close to the launch, coming up through the
green sea water with neatness and- dispatch. ' Then it spouted â even harder
than Knight spouted at Philadelphia. This surprised Knight, who didn't be
lieve that anything earthly could outdo him in that particular line.
But the occupants of the launch hadn't lost? a whale... Speedily the little
craft was turned about. George and Harry mercifully refrained .; from 'an
nihilating the whale then and there and the, huge mammal will furnish 'more
fun before It goes to sea again, unless it meets some one less merciful than
Knight and Scott. * . .

PREPARING FOR THE JOHN
GRACE CHALLENGE CUP
The hares which were used in the re
serve stake at San Mateo Coursing Park
yesterday played an important part in the
programme, and to them was charged
many of the day's upsets. There were no
complaints of unfair tests on account of
short runs, and in many Instances dog
owners felt that their hounds were given
enough hard work for two stakes.
The hares being well drilled to the es
capes, made the hounds extend themselves
and the results show an unusually heavy |
score. Kosomon.de ran a course lasting
over two minutes in the first round and.
piled up 3 points against Proud Beauty.
ThÂ» result was favorable to the pikers.
who made a strong play on Rosomonde at
2^5 to 1. She was withdrawn in the next
round. Sweet Faverdale and Mountain
Belle ran an undecided the like of which
is seldom seen in coursing events. Tne
pair were slipped to an educated hare, j
which was well acquainted with the loca
tion of the escapes. Wnen the jack was !
released it shot up the field straight for
the escape and reached it without deviat
ing from its course. The hounds followed
at even terms with not enough difference
between them to allow for speed and with- |
out a turn. !

in a course with Pennegrant in the third i
round, went up asainst a fast Merced
grain destroyer, which reached the escape
quite ahead of Temple. The dog: was not
to be denied, however. With one great;
effort he cleared the fence and was among- j
a shipload of hares. Luckily he -was j
caught before he entered into what would
have been a heavy contract for himâ the
destroying of the bunch.
Lady Davenport won the stake, beating
Hadiwist in the deciding course in a short
run. The runner-upwas handicapped in the
last go, having had severe courses
throughout the stake.

FORCES HIS CLAIM
Humored That Compromise Will Be
Effected by Deceased Capital
ist's Heirs.
It is rumored that negotiations looking
toward a compromise between the heirs
of the late ' William H. Piper and his al
leged illegitimate son, Frederick William
Piper Aiken, son of Mrs. W. H. Alken,
formerly Mrs. Baldwin,, are now being
conducted by counsel representing the In
terested parties. The alleged illegitimate
son claims the millions of the deceased
capitalist by authority of a four-line holo
graphic will! and although some doubt as
to the legality of the testament has been
expressed by opposing counsel it is assert
ed that raiher than contest the document
they will pay a fortune for Its surrender.
The matter of the citation upon ex-
Judge A. A. Sanderson to produce the holo
graphic will bequeathing the estate to the
alleged Illegitimate son was called by
Judge Dunne, sitting in Judge Troutt's
court, yesterday. An agreement among
counsel for a continuance until the return
of Judge Troutt was accepted by the court
and an order in conformity with this
agreement was made. In the meantime a
settlement with Frederick William Piper
Aiken may be effected. Â» ; rs;
Dr. Leland Could Find No Trace
of Alleged Criminal
Operation.
Dr. Leland, autopsy physician at the
Morgue, performed a post-mortem exam
ination yesterday on the remains of Mrs,
Jeanne La Roche and found that the
cause of death was alcoholism.
Mrs. La Roche died on "Wednesday night
at the Hotel Sutherland. Dr. Putnam,
who attended her, and a Miss Simpson, a
nurse, gave out that the deceased told
them that the illness which caused her
death was Induced by a criminal opera
tion. At the time of her death Mrs. La
Roche had been on a spree of several,
days' duration.
"The cause of Mrs. La Roche's death
was alcoholism," said Dr. Leland. "In
my examination I could find no trace of a
criminal operation having been performed,
though such might have been the case
under certain conditions without its leav
ing any noticeable trace."
Emil Gunzburger, for years the confi
dential agent of Mrs. La Roche, was
granted special letters of administration
upon decedent'ssestate yesterday. In his
petition Gunzburger stated that there was
property in the apartments occupied by
the deceased at 791 Sutter street that
needed immediate attention. Judge
Dunne made the order and Gunzburger
immediately took charge of the estate.

Judge de Haven I>ecides in Favor of
Simpson & Magee for Sal
vage.
United States District Judge de Haven
yesterday handed down an opinion in the
suit of A. M. Simpson and James Magee
against the steamship Grace Dollar for
salvage. In the course of the opinion
Judge de Haven said;
"In rendering the service for which sal
vage Is claimed In the present case no ei
traordlnary effort was put forth by the
Columbia, and neither the .tug nor any of
her crew was exposed to the slightest dan
ger in making fast to the Grace Dollar
and towing her to a place of safety. In
fact, the master of the Columbia declined
to permit* his crew to " take the risk of
launching a boat for the purpose of carry
ing a line to the distressed steamer. The
evidence also shows that the ordinary
charge for towing a vessel of the size of
the Grace Dollar and loaded as she was
from the place she went aground to
Marshfleld was about $175.
"In view of all the facts and governed
by the general principles declared in . the
cases above cited the Judgment of the
court will be that libelants are entitled to
recover the sum of $1000, to be divided as
follows: Three-fourths of that sum to
the tug Columbia and the remaining one
fourth to the master for himself andf crew
and to be divided between them in propor
tion to. their wages, the libelants to re
cover costs. The cross-libel will be dis
missed."

John Hayden, a prominent butcher do

the carelessness of a motorman in charge
of trolley car 931 of the Eighth and Ken

could be no possible excuse for a col

had just left' Army street and was In the
act of crossing Kentucky when ihe car
bore down on him at a high rate of speed.
No bell was rung or other signal given
and the first Intimation which Hayden
had of his danger came when the car
struck his buggy. He landed about forty
feet away and was considerably stunned
by the fall. On coming to he found that
his buggy had been smashed Into kindling
wood and that the two fore legs of his
valuable horse were broken.

CHARGES AGAINST THE MANAGEMENT OF
THE CITY'S ELECTRICAL DEPARTMENT
Joint Commissioners Have Had a
Detective on the Case and His
Report Will Be the Subject of
an Investigation to Commence
This Afternoon.
cr?r? â FAIRS in the city department
// \\ of electricity will be the subject
jl- â i\ of an Important session of the
[I \v, -joint commission in control of the
department which will be held
this afternoon In police headquarters.
There has been much dissatisfaction over
the management of th<? present superin
tendent. William R. Hewitt, and a good
part of the session will be *pent In look-
Ing into his ca.se. He will be questioned
as to property unaccounted for, ineffi
ciency in certain branches of his depart
ment! the existence of tappers that aÂ«ld
nothing to the revenue of the city, the
disappearance of lines and poles, the
flipht of dollars from the workmen's
wages and a number of other matters which
the joint commission Iras decided It would
better inquire into.
The basis ut the Investigation will be
two reports â one submitted by a commit
tee thut Sucked over the department on
its own account and another submitted
by iJettective Tom tiibsun. who wtts de-.
tailed to run down a few of the reports
that followed in the wake of the Hewitt
management. There was another report
submitted by l'rofe.-^sor Clarence L.
Corey, professor of electrieal engineer
ing at toe Suite University, but it was so
superlatively tavorable that it led to the
committee's report. The Corey report win
not come uy In evidence.
The re;Â»urt ot ihe committee was sub
milted last April and since then it has
lain usidt-, but with the appearance of
more sensational facts it will be taken
up iigain. Tiie substance of the report
Â¦Wiih. ihat the system In use had not been
Uej>t ui> to date; that old-fashioned ap
paratus was being used, and that it was
a. system that lied long ago been dis
carded In other large cities of the coun
trv. It also Questions the advisability of
laying sie^l underground conduits, and
then in a supplemental report D. 1. Ma
honey, one or the committee, declares
â¢ that it was evident tne employes of trie
department were not selected for their
proficiency but rather for their iwlitical
a.fliliatiui>. Hewitt is a nephew of Rai
ney. and it was not hard Si>r Mahoney to
eee where the unities crept in.
Recently it iRcame the desire of the de
partment to extend its suburban rystem.
Poles bad been taken up all over the
citv Â»rhere wires had l>een transferred to
the poles of'iigrht and power companies,
and a!.~o where the city's wires had been
placed under ground, but when poles were
v:anttd it was found that not one could be
had. Hewitt was called to headquarters
and was asked what he had done with
the poles, and he said that at a
future lime he would explain all.
This led to the employment of Gibson,
fjnti the result of Oibson's investigations
â¢were embodied in a report which Police
Commissioner Mahoney now lias and
which will be brought up at the meeting
to-day. Gibson's report has never been
before the members of the joint com
inlFsion as a body. Instead it was hand
ed around from one to the other to be
read' by them individually. Then at the
last meeting the subject was approached
and it ivas En a fair way to be discussed,
when one or two of the newspaper re
porters dropped into the meeting room
and the discussion came to an abrupt
conclusion.
In his report Detective Gibson has the
affidavits of reveral employes and ex
employefl of the department, some of
whom tell of poles disappearing and oth-
ers of tappers working steadily in defi
ance of the provision of the charter that
says they must pay the city for the priv
ilege. There is an affidavit from one man
who hauled a lond of poles, sawed and
split Into kindling wood, to Smith's res
taurant on Clay street, between Mont
gomery and bansuxne. Mike Wall and
iJan bhs-a, two employes of the depart
ment, Kot enough to build fences oÂ£ split
pickets around their homes: and there
were- others- wno shared In the woodpile.
It is also stated that the poles were all
eawed and split at the city's expense.
Ciibson'-s rtyort also includes a. descrip
tion of the patents that Hewitt has taken
out s^nee hÂ«? got the position of superin
tendent seven years ago. It was feared
by the Commissioners that the system
would be found so tieJ up with these pat
ents that it would be impossible, or at
least very expensive, to broach the sub
ject of a change in the oliice of super
intendent. Gibson found that Hewitt has
sevt-ral patents on the apparatus In the
central ottice on Brenham place; also a
patent on a harness release which he is
introducing into the department, and also
one on a "horse let go," a device that re
leases the animals from their stalls at the
first stroke of the gong. It is not prob
able, however, that the withdrawal oi any
of these patents could cripple the depart
ment, for there are scores of :;uch devices
In use all over the L'nited States.
As to the tappers operating from the
main llr.es, Gibson rei>orted enough to
show that the tapper industry Is not by
any means dead. When the department
became a paid department the use of the
tapper became almost nominal. The char
ter provides, however, that without inter
fering with the signals on the main lines
tappers may be put in for those desiring
them upon payment of a certain sum reg
uiarly to the city as rc-nt. Hewitt had re
ported to the commission that there were
ho more of thf-.^e tappers working, and so
there has been no revenue from that
source, but there are tappers working,
according to Gibson's report, and he has
receipts to show that money has been paid
for them. The tapper is operated by a
patent taken out by Hewitt, but it is un
der the management of Alfred Clarke Jr..
superintendent of the auxiliary fire alarm
system. The tappers at one time, during
the days of the old department, brought
in a revenue <if $2 per month apiece, and
the only expense attached was that of in
stallation and repair. Nothing was paid
to tht? city for the use of its signals, and
nothing is being paid to the city now.
There is another interesting bit in the
affidavit of Mike Wall. He was at one
time inspector in the police telegraph de
partment. Ho tells how it became a cus
tom in the ofllee to stop a dollar out of
the pay of the linesmen at night when
thry worked overtime for house-movers.
When a house is moved during the day
linesmen are sent out to cut the wire's
In Its path, and under tho?e circum
stances they are paid by the city. But
when a house is moved at night, the lines
men sent out are rated as working over
time and the house-movers must pay. The
pay has always been $5 and the money is
put in advance into the hands of the chief
operator. Four years ago It was an
nounced that the men would get but four
of the five, and for a long time this held
good. One man objected, but he was told
that "if he didn't want to work for $4
he needn't work at all," and that brought
the men to time. What became of the
extra dollar none of them ever knew.
There has also been investigation re
garding the existence of junk â old wire,
"zincs" and "coppers" from the batteries,
brass filings and similar waste â but none
has been found. In the seven years that
Hewitt has been in office there has never

on the case.
Harper and Armstrong have suspected
Campbell, and when they met him last
night his arrest followed. At the station
he gave the occupation of an iron molder
and is about 35 years of age. Ha will
probably be charged to-day.
Hewitt makes a general denial of all the
allegations of mismanagement. "It is the
outcome of dirty politics," he said, "and
is an effort to get me out of the way so
that the patronage of my office may be
made use of. Certain people want this
There is more talk of mismanagement In
the department, but it will be with the
question of material that the Commission
ers will devote themselves principally.
They are all unwilling to talk about the
matter, and the fact that it has been
brewing among them for so long is proof
of their desire to go at the Investigation
with as little stir as possible. The meet-
Ing this afternoon is a special session.
Nothing has been said about it. and it is
probable the Commissioners hoped to meet

been a scrap heap large enough to cause
comment. William Pennycook, a lines
man, put in a month on Rainey's new
house on Golden Gate avenue, wiring the
fixtures for lights and the walls for bells,
and putting in batteries wherever they
were needed. The material was supposed
to have come from the department. The
"let goes." for which the city paid Hewitt
a royaltv, were made In the department
shops out of department material, and the
harness releases were put in through a
similar channel.
