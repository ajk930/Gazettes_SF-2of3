CRUISERS READY FOR
IMMEDIATE SERVICE
NEW YORK. July 16. âA special to thÂ«
Press from Philadelphia says: The cruis
ers Columbia, Minneapolis and Yankee
have been got Into readiness for Imme
diate service. Steam Is up and no one
not connected with the ships la allowed
on board. Berths have been put Into tho
Yankee. It Is surmised the vessels are
to be used In transporting troops, though
the Columbia and Minneapolis have com
paratively few accommodations for that
service.
From Chefu comes the report that the entire adult male population of the three provinces
of Chili. Shansi and Shantung are massing to defend Peking, under the conviction that the
powers mean war. There is little doubt that a further check of the allies at Tientsin would be the
signal for a general anti-foreign rising throughout China.
The Japanese officers are still confident of their ability to reach Peking before the roads
become impassable, but the European commanders believe an advance will be â¢ impossible before
September.
Fighting is said to be imminent at Newchwang, where the Boxers are threatening the for
eign settlement. The Russians have barricaded the streets and loopholed the houses of the for
eigners. The bank officials have removed their valuables to Port Arthur. Perhaps the most se
rious among the many reports from Shanghai is the rumor that .since the massacre at Peking five
Chinese regiments have been ordered south with instructions to make Chinghanpo, at the head of
the Grand canal, the objective point for the southward extension of the Boxer movement.

RISING OF ENTIRE POPULATION.
LONDON, July 17, 3:53 a. m. â Up to this hour no further news has been received re
garding the reported massacre at Peking from any source. In the House of Commons last even
ing, beyond an admission that there was no ground for hoping that the report was not true, Wil
liam St. John Brodcrick, Parliamentary Secretary for the Foreign Office, had nothing to commun
icate. An unusual hush fell upon the Chamber when the subject came up. A few members doff
ed their hats, but otherwise there was no demonstration.
Telegrams from Shanghai and Chefu indicate an increasingly serious state of affairs. It is
alleged that the foreign Consuls at Shanghai have cabled their governments that there is urgent
need for warships to protect that city, owing to the menacing attitude of the Chinese and the
temptation to loot the vast stores of merchandise recently accumulated there. It seems that the
Chinese have already threatened to fire the great oil tanks on the Chaotang side of the city.
NO FURTHER NEWS OF THE HASSACRB.
>P3&ERLIX; July 16. â The news regarding the massacre at Peking has been received by the
Â§r\ German press with a unanimous expression of deepest sorrow and indignation. The Vos-
CaiS^' sische Zeitung says: "There is no excuse for a nation which commits such crimes and none
for a government which tolerates or does not try. to prevent them."
The papers insist upon absolute perfect harmony between the powers henceforth.
"The powers will no longer quarrel," says the Lokal Anzeiger, "or weigh things against
each other. They will try everything-. They will risk every man and every groat until this 'un
paralleled crime has met with the punishment it deserves."
The whole nation seems imbued with similar sentiments. Emperor William was immedi
ately notified. The number of Germans massacred at Peking is said to be ninety-three, including
the detachment of marines, Professors Stahlman, Colonel von Bismarck and Von Bronn of the Pe
king University, several German officials belonging to the Chinese customs, several merchants and
the members of the legations, with Baroness von Ketteler.
Dr. Mumm von Schwarzenstein arrived this evening. He will receive instructions from the
Foreign Office and start for China on Saturday, accompanied by General von Dergoltz.
TIENTSIN, July 13. â In to-day's combined attack upon the native city over forty guns
bombarded the Chinese positions. The fighting was most determined and the allies' losses
were heavy. Eight Chinese guns were captured and the Chinese were driven out of the west
arsenal after a fierce cannonade. A strong mixed force is close to the walls and it is expected
an assault will be made to-morrow.

WASHINGTON, July 16.â The Navy Department this morning received official confirmation from Admiral Remey of the reverse of the allied forces at Tientsin on the morning of July 13. The dispatch is dated
Chefu. July 1 6, and it says:
"It is reported that the allied forces attacked the native city on the morning of July 13, the Russians on the right, with the Ninth Infantry, and the marines on the left. The losses of the allied forces were large â
the Russians 100, including the artillery; Americans, over 30; British, over 40; Japanese, 58, including their colonel; the French, 25. Colonel Emerson H. Liscum, Ninth Infantry, was killed, and Captain Davis of the United States
Marine Corps, Captain Lealy and Lieutenants Butler and Leonard were wounded. At 7 in the evening the allied attack op the native city was repulsed with great loss. Returns are yet incomplete; details not confirmed.

LONDON, July 1 6. â The Evening News prints a dispatch dated at Shanghai to-day giving a detailed account of the attack of the allied forces on the native city of Tientsin, as reported in the dispatch to the
Associated Press dated Tientsin, July 13, via Chefu, July 15, and Shanghai, July 16. According to the Evening News' dispatch the allies were repulsed and compelled to retreat with a loss of more than a hundred killed, the British
losing forty and the Japanese sixty. The Americans and Russians, it is added, also suffered heavily. Among the Americans killed was Colonel Liscum of the Ninth Infantry. A Russian colonel of artillery was also killed.
The dispatch adds that the Chinese fought with great desperation and their marksmanship was accurate and deadly.

f^* IENTSIN, July 1 3 (via Chefu> July 1 5, and Shanghai, July 1 6). â At 2 o'clock this afternoon 7000 of the allied troops were attempting to storm the wall of the city. The attack began at daylight. Its success is doubtful.
aL J The Chinese on the walls are estimated conservatively at 20,000. They are pouring a terrific hail of artillery, rifle and machine gun fire upon the attackers. The Americans, Japanese, British and French troops are at-
S^ tacking from the west and the Russians from the east. :
The Americans suffered terribly. As the Associated Press representative left the field the chief surgeon of the Ninth Infantry said a conservative estimate was that 25 percent of the Americans were hit.
Colonel Wiiiiam H. Liscum is reported to have been mortally wounded as he was walking in front of the troops. Major Regan and Captains Bookmiller, Wilcox and Noyes are among the wounded.
The marines' losses included Captain Davis killed and Butler, Leonard and several others wounded.
Officers declared that it was hotter than Santiago. When the correspondent left the Americans were lying in the plain between the wall and the river, under an enfilading and direct fire. It was equally difficult
for them to advance or retire. The correspondent counted 300 wounded men of all nationalities. J
WASHINGTON, July 16.â The officers of the United States Marine Corps mentioned in the foregoing dispatch are probably Captain Austin R. Davis, recently at Manila, killed, and First Lieutenant Smedley D. Butler of
the United States vessel Newark and First Lieutenant Henry Leonard, recently on duty at Cavite and also of the Newark, wounded. It is stated at the War Department that no such person as Captain Wilcox, who was reported
wounded, is in the Ninth Infantry. The officials here think it might be Major Wallace of the Ninth. ;.

If Minister Conger is dead, Edwin An

oldest male Conger living, and to him will
descend the family traditions and honor.
There will be no wealth.- In his business
and officeholding Jilr. Conger is generally
reputed to have gathered about $100,000
at one time. This has been; dissipated to
the four winds. Not by dissipation, for
Minister Conger was always an abstainer,
but by unfortunate investment. The Cali
fornia Conger is a â¢ nephew of Minister
Conger, whose brother married the daugh

was elected Treasurer of the county. Gen

father "of Edwin Ankeny Conger, John

His Bomantic Marriage.
The marriage of Mr. Conger and Miss
Pike was romantic. The friendship, at
tachment and love had its origin in col-,
lege life. Both attended Lombard Uni-'
verslty, 'were classmates and sweethearts
in college. The war took the young man
away, but the attachment then formed
was not broken . and marriage followed.
A son . and daughter were born to this
couple. The son, Lorentus, died. The
daughter, is a remarkably brilliant young
woman of a mathematical turn of mind.

in the West. She came home with her
mother in November, spent the winter
here, and returned to China with her
cousin, Miss Pierce, and her mother in
February.
Minister Conger was a member of the
Masonic Lodge. He joined It while a
soldier. The incidents that led up to this
step were convincing to him of the good
of the order. He was taken slelc with
typhoid while his regiment was under
light marching orders during: the first
year of his army service. It became nec
essary, to leave him behind and a com
rade volunteered to remain with him.

have been worrying about the Pe

Mrs. Ida II. Conger, widow of the
brother of Minister E. H. Conger;
"even longer than the people generally
have. This was on account of the letters
we received from our relatives In Peking.
The Minister repeatedly cautioned his
family from giving to the public informa

political character, and the people have
not known how much we have worried
over the situation which did not appear to
them grave until about three weeks ago.
Dead Minister's Relatives.
"In a letter which we recently received
Minister Conger told us about being
alarmed, and the facts in the official mes
sage which was given out at Washington
have been known, to some extent, to us
for a long time. I have hoped against
reason. Almost all the news of rumors â
which Is all we have had for a month â
was capable of being construed as gooo
news. .The remainder of the Des Moines
relatives of the Minister and his family
are more sanguine than I am."
The Des Moines relatives are:
Mrs. Ida H. Conger, Miss Anna Conger,
daughter of Mrs. Ida Conger: Edwin C.

INTERESTING LIFE HISTORY
OF MINISTER CONGER
presses confidence that henceforth the
powers' solidarity of Interests will assume
perfect harmony.
The Foreign Office further states that
Dr. Mumm von Schwartzenstein. appoint
ed Minister to China in succession to the
late Baron von Ketteler, will proceed to t
China, notwithstanding the latest de
velopments. â¢
Regarding the anomalous position of the
Chinese Minister here, the Foreign Office
said the Minister admittedly does not
know whence the declaration of June
emanated. He also admitted that he could
not vouch for the correctness of all the
Chinese dispatches he had received lately.
The Foreign Office pointed out to him
that until the situation has become
clearer all the communications should not
be considered as emanating from ths
Chinese Government.
REPORTED KILLING OF
WOUNDED DISCREDITED
The Foreign Office also, considering un
limited telegraphic communication be
tween -Lu Hal Huan. the Chinese Minister
to Germany, and China incompatible just
now with Germany's interests, to-day is
sued orders inhibiting Chinese Legation
dispatches.
LONDON, July 16.â The Government ac
credits the report that in the retreat of
the Peking column Admiral Seymour's
wounded were killed by comrades In order
that they might not te tortured by the
Chinese. There has been nothing to ver
ify the report and the Government be
lieves it most improbable. The report re
ceives no credence elsewhere.
The Tientsin dispatch announcing tho
repulse v of the allies was the first news
the Foreign Office had received of the oc
currence and mroduced a feeling akin to
dismay. "Willftfrn St. John Broderick, the
Parliamentary Secretary of the Foreign
Office, left the office prepared to give the
House of Commons a rather satisfactory
account of the conditions at Tientsin. Thi3
report of the Associated Press dispatch
was immediately sent after him. Regard
ing the eventful solution of the crisis ami
the length of time troops will take to
reach Peking, there is not a glimmer in
the minds of British officials.
"All we can do," said one of the most
responsible offlc!als, "is to hope for the
best and pray that Japan's troops may
move quickly. Nothing ha3 passed re
garding the general situation of the pow
ers since we decided to ask Japan to do
the major portion of the work, and noth
ing is likely to be done unless a repetition
of to-day's bad news compol.s every power
to send proportionate reinforcement*."
With reference to the Tientsin dispatch
quoting the complaints of British refu
gees, the Foreign Office informed the cor
respondent to-day that no instructions
had been issued to Admiral Seymour not
to take on board British subjects: in fact,
all his instructions imply otherwise, and
they were unable to understand the condi
tions reported.
PRESIDENT HURRIES '
BACK TO WASHINGTON
CANTON, Ohio. July IS.â President Mc-
Kinley left here at 10:50 thi3 evening for
Washington in a special car attached to
the regular Pennsylvania train. Only
Secretary to the President Cortelyou ac
companied him. He will attend to mat
ters in connection with the Chinese situ
ation and In the course of a few days ex
pects to return to Canton. Meanwhile
the Canton home will be conducted as at
persent, Mrs. McKinley remaining.
It is expected that the caomet mem
bers will be at the White House to-mor
row, and that a meeting will be held soon,
after the President's arrival. It can ba
stated with certainty that no extra ses
sion of Congress has yet been datermlne<l
tipon, and that it has not been decided to
issue a call for troops for service in
China. No effort was made to conceal
the fact that the President was much ex
ercised over the reports which came to
him during the day. To-day when he
filled an engagement made several days
ago to take lunch with an old friend, J.
W. McClymonds, in Massillon, he first
made arrangements for direct connection
with the executive officers in Washing
ton, and his social conversation was con
stantly interrupted with long-distance
telephone conversation with the seat of
government.
BRAVERY OF AMERICAN
AND JAPANESE TROOPS
LONDON, July 15.â The Foreign OfHco
to-dajf Issued a dispatch from General Dor

to the previous information. The Chinese,

commanding 500 Japanese, attacked tho
Chinese and captured their positions
southeast of the city, killed ninety-five
and captured four guns. The Japanese
and American troops subsequently rushed
and took the western arsenal.
General Dorward adds that the day's
honors rested with the American and Jap
anese. There were no casualties among
the Americans or the Russians.
ROCKHILL MAY BE
CONGER'S SUCCESSOR
WASHINGTON, July 16.â A rumor
gained circulation at some of the foreign
establishments to-day and was accepted
with some degree of credit that W. W.
Rockhill would be named as the United
States representative to China. Inquiry
failed to confirm the report and in any
event It is probable the consideration of
any such step would be deferred until the
last vestige of doubt as to the fate of the
Ministers at Peking was dispelled.
Mr. Rockhill is at present chief, of tho
Pan-American Bureau. When asked as to
the report he said his name had not been
considered so far as he knew, and that
all his plans were made to go to South
America on August 7. He is one of the
few Americans able to speak Chinese flu
ently and as he has traveled through
China he would be exceptionally well
qualified for any service in the empire.
Escaped to Shanghai.
LOS ANGELES. July 16.-J. C Drake of
this city to-day received a cable from his
brother. Dr. Ncah Field Drake, dated
Shanghai. Dr. Drake, who was professor
of mining and geology at the Imperial
University at .Tientsin, says that he.- e S -#
caped to Shanghai, accompanied by Prv
fessor Hoover of the Imperial University.
The whereabouts of the other three Amer
ican professors of-the university he does
not know.
BERLIN, July 16.â The Germany Con
sul at Chefu, having communicated to
the Governor of Shantung Emperor Wil
liam's offer of a reward of 1000 taels for
the rescue of foreigners at Peking, has
received the Governor's reply, which is
dated July 13, to the effect that the shut
ting up of foreigners in Peking has deeply
touched his heart, but attempts to relieve
them have failed owing to the revolt In
Chih Li, but the Governor adds that he
will do his best to effect their release.
At the Foreign Office here there is no
question as to the correctness of the news
of the massacre of foreigners in Peking.
Officials take the view that It Is against
the interests of the Chinese to admit that
there has been a massacre, and therefore
the China advices on the subject are for
once probably true.
Regarding Tientsin, the Foreign Office's
latest dispatch from Admiral Bendemann
declares that the situation has Improved,
as reinforcements continue to arrive.
The Foreign Office, while deeply deplor
ing the horrible events at 'Peking, ex-
YOKOHAMA June 3O.-The Peking
correspondent of the China Mail,
writing on May 31, says:
The promises of the Tsung-li Ya

the Boxer wizardry gees on with little px

to be attacked and occasionally looted
while native Christians, Catholic and
Protestant, are terrorized, beaten, robbed,
hunted from their homes and all are m
danger of their lives. -
On May 25 a gang of Boxers went to tne
houses of Christians at Shan Lai ling ana
burned them down. One aged woman is
supposed to have perished in the flames.
The other inmates escaped. Some of the
men were able to flv to Peking, ine
women and children were received and
hidden by neighbors. On the following
day the Boxers reassembled and forced
the protectors of the Christians to give
them up. As soon as the Boxers got hold
of them they hacked them to pieces and
threw them into the Ta Ching River. Thus
eight innocent women and children were
barbarously murdered in cold blood by the
savages, regarded by the Empress Dow
ager and her favored advisers as patriot
ic volunteers. The other Christians are
missing. Shan Lai Ying Is five miles from
Pa Chow and Pa Chow is sixty miles from

Burned by Boxers.
On Monday, May 28. the Boxers attacked
Fengtai and burned it. Ma Chiapu was
threatened, but possibly owing to the sud

destroyed. Charg Sing Tien was attacked
on Tuesday and burned, but the foreign
ers all escaped. Feng.al is six miles from
the gate of Peking. Ma Chiapu is about
one mile. Chang Sing Tien is ten miles

the sacred capital there was a good deal
of excitement.
At Chang Sing Tien a lad of about 16
was killed by a shot fired by foreigners to
keep back the mob. Said the informant,
an eye-witness, "But he was not a Box
er." He was asked. "Then why was he
shot?" "Well, he replied, "when a gun ia
fired who under heaven can tell where the
bullet will go?"
I mention this as the average Chinese
opinion of the marksmansrflp of their own
soldiers and to some of us here it is a
comforting reflection.
Many families have moved from the
comparative safety of Peking to the cer
tain danger of the country.
Our brave generalissimo, Yung Lu, went
out, protected by his valiant battalions.
He resolutely looked at the burned places,
then turned round and found a safe place
in which to meditate on the perils of
modern life. He never tried to find or
arrest or phoot one of the despicable
wretches who burned Peng Tai. Neither
did the other brave commanders. There
fore the fanatical Boxers are still at lib
erty to pursue their diabolical work:
The following dispatch has been re
ceived from Shanghai, dated June 21:
Captain Laws of the Iltes has died from
the injuries he received on the occasion
of the bombardment of Taku.
Activity of Japan.
Japan is meeting the situation In China
with a vigor and promptitude which
would be surprising were it not that thi3
has long been looked upon as the land of
surprises.' At a Cabinet meeting held on
Monday last the sum of fifty million yens
was appropriated -for the immediate ex
penses involved in the instant dispatch
of troops, vividly recalling the applica
tion of a like sum by the United States
Congress at the inception of the trouble
with Spain. This amount will supply the
necessary sinews until the meeting of the
Diet.
The mobilization of the troops and the
movements of the transport fleets and
naval vessels continue, and the efflciency
of the military machine of the empire is
being demonstrated as clearly as In the
late struggle with China, when it com
manded the admiration of the whole
force of foreign experts.
The troops mobilized by the Govern
ment here will number nearly 30,000, and
it is safe to assume that within two
weeks at the latest, with the large force3
of Russians and British on the way, the
allies will have at their disposal an army
of a hundred thousand men. which will
be ample for the initial operations.
Trouble in Korea Feared.
From Korea there are indications of
serious trouble arising from an anti-
Christian and anti-foreign movement
similar to that of the Boxers. The mis
sionary element there, as In China, comes
in for a good share of the blame, and the
sentiment among the foreign population
In the Orient is increasingly strong in
favor of doing something to check this
ever-recurrent menace to the world's
peace.
There are no means for estimating the
number of foreigners in Tientsin and Pe
king except by approximation. Accord
ing to the latest Chinese directories Is
sued by the Hongkong Press last year
there were upon the Tientsin list some six
hundred and seventy-five names of Euro
pean males. A conservative estimate of
women Â«and children would make the to
tal foreign population about two thou
sand. The normal estimate of Peking on
the same basis would be about one-half
of that number, but it Is to be remem
bered that on the approach of tho
troubles the Influx of missionaries and
their families fleeing from the surround
ing districts must have largely Increased
the foreign contingent. Of the number
of Japanese in the.tv/o cities there are no
mwns of making any intelligent estimate.
Up to date the Japanese Government
has chsrtercJ seventeen steamships to be
used In transporting troops ;o China

WASHINGTON. July 16.--The de
cision of the administration at
the end of a most eventful day
is that the United States Gov
ernment is still not at war with
the Government of China. The big hap
penings at Tientsin, coming on top of the
stories of the last struggles at Peking,
have not affected the attitude of the ad
ministration on this point;' the United
States and China are technically at peace.
But this statement should pot be accepted
as indicating a purpose en the part of th.2
United State Government to hold its hand
in the administration of swift and .-ixie
quate punishment upon the Chinese, with
out regard to station, who may be re
sponsible for the outrages of the past few
weeks. It means simply that the Gov
ernment of the United States feels that
it can best achieve that purpose by rc
parding the status officially as one of
peace. Xo hold otherwise would seriousjy
cripple the Government in iis effort- to
obtain satisfaction for the outrages the
Americans in China have suffered. . We
should find the ports of China, now open
to us, closed and all sorts of impediments
would- be encountered which are now
missing 1 . Therefore, according to tho ad
ministration's view. a. declaration of war
would afford not even a technical gain,
while it would actually oe a heavy draw
back. Chairman Cannon of the Jlouse
Appropriations Committee, is authority
for the statement that money in plenty
I? at the disposal of the President to moot
the present emergency and that there is
no necessity for a called session of Con
gress on that -ycore.
Special Cabinet Meeting.
The day was the most exciting Wash-
Ir.frton has known since the battle of San
tiago. At the very beginning came Ad
miral Rcmey's cablegram announcing tho
defeat of the allied forces at Tientsin, and
ihen came the vivid account of the tight.
A special Cabinet meeting was held on
receipt of this news, with such members
1 if sent as are in town. Greai reluctance
was manifested on the part of the par
ticipants to answer questions as to tho
nature of the deliberations. The best in
dication of its nature was the departure;
fur the UTiite House of Secretary Hay
immediately after the meeting. He sat
down and had a long talk with President
McKtoley over the long-distance tele
phone and it soon became known that the
President had decided that it would *:e
best for him to come back from Canton
to the capital.
The cabinet officers talked over the pos
sibilities of reinforcng the troops in
China. There wps no disposition shown
to withhold these troops; the only ques
tion '*as as to the amount of additional
force available. That was a technical
question, so it was left to the War De
partment to decide. The only point laid
oowa was that the Government would
send forward all the troops that could
be spaied at this time. One proposition
discussed by the Cabinet appeared to
have a very practical aspect about it.
Technical men had mafle objection to tin;
further conduct of the Chinese campaign
Pith an international force without some
working understanding as to the duty ol
each power represented. It was suggested
that an international conference be called

hastily at one of the capitalsâ London,
Berlin. Paris or Washingtonâ to define tiie
part to be taken by each power and tn>j
quota of troops to be furnished and ar
range for the selection of a commander
in chief of the allied forces.
Increase of the Force.
This suggestion did not meet a fav
orable reception. It was felt by the Cabi
net- that the United States should send
what force it could dispose of to China,
as far as seemed necessary, and should
not make any agreement with other pow
ers as to the number. This decision in
volves the increase of the force of troops
destined for "China. The responsible of
ficials evaded any specific statement as
to the extent of this increase. It was,
however, gathered, that the reinforce
ments would be limited only by the abil
ity of" the Government to spare troop3
from tho?e commands now in the United
States and. Cuba. :
The estimates varied as to how many
could be Fparcd, but the general opinion
was that somewhere between 4OQ0 and blHW
could be shipped to the Ea'st from Cuba
and the l.'nited States, In addition to the
troops already under arms. A statement
prepared by Adjutant General Corbin
shows that there are now a grand total of
10,665 officers and men in China, en route
to China, en route to Nagasaki or under
orders for Nagasaki. This, of course, in
cludes the ill-fated Ninth Infantry, which
may not be in condition for further ser
vice. General Wood's last reports indi
cate that owing to the tranquility pre
vailing in Cuba it will be entirely safe to
decrease the military force there quite
largely.
But even with these Cuban troops it will
be necessary, if the Cabinet's plans are
carried out, to divest the home posts of
gairi^ons, save in the case of the heavy
artillery organizations at sea-coast points.
About all the troops within the borders
of the I'nited States which would be avail
able for Chinese service under a call are
these regiments: Second, Fifth, Seventh
and Eighth cavalry regiments intact; one
squadron each of the First and Sixth
Cavalry; the First, Tenth and Eleventh
regiments of infantry complete; one bat
these regiments: Second. Fifth, Seventh
Fourteenth. Eighteenth, Twenty-third and
Twenty-fifth infantry regiments, and
three companies of the Twenty-fourth In
fantry. This available force of cavalry
and infantry aggregates about 9000 men.
Some artillery undoubtedly would be sent,
and there are light batteries K of the
First Artillery, A and F of the Second,
C and F of the Third. B of the Fourth,
G of the Fifth and C and M of the Seventh
available. There are besides Companies
C and D of the Engineers and four com
panies of the Signal Corps.
Estimates May Be Increased.
Secretary Root was reluctant to admit
that there was any necessity for more
American troops in China, and at the close
of the day he said that thus far he had
Issued no. orders for reinforcements.
Secretary Root said that in view of the
small standing army of the /United States,
of our insignificant force of field artil
lery as compared with that of the great
European powers and of our lack of terri
torial interest in China, the 10,000 men
represented more than the United States'
pro rata share of the international force
which is to operate against Peking. The
War Department, he said, so far has re
sponded in full to every demand made
upon It by the joint conference of foreign
commanders in China. The situation has
changed so rapidly from day to day as to
alter the estimate of the foreign com
manders several times. It is possible
that the estimate of troops needed for
Chinese service will be again increased.
If so, the United States will respond. By
scouring this country and denuding it of
all regular troops except a very few in
the heavy artillery in charge of valuable
poacoast guns and by making still fur
ther demands upon the forces In Cuba
and Porto Rico, we might possibly gather i
between 3000 and 400(5 additional troops. 'â¢
This, however, would be the limit unless
the War Department disregarded a ree
ommendatiflh of General MacArthur and
drew still further on the available troops
in the Philippines. This was a future
contingency which would not have to be
met until it arose. Secretary Root ex
pressed the hope that the first reports of
the disastrous battle of the 13th at Tien
tsin might prove to be exaggerated, but
the War Department, it was stated, had
no official information beyond that trans
mitted in Admiral Remey's cablegram of
this morning.
General Males' View.
General Miles was called upon by Sec
retary Root during the afternoon to coun
sel with him as to the projected troop
movements. He favors the prompt dis
patch of a large force to China,
A good deal of annoyance has been
caused here by the complete misunder
standing that has been conveyed to the
European nations as to the attitude of
the United States Government regarding
the settlement of the Chinese troubles.
This Government, it can be stated author
itatively, never has thought of com
promising for money or any other form
of indemnity. Indeed, the subject of
money indemnity or any apology never
has been thought of or mentioned by the
Government of the United States. The
Government will insist on Justice and ret
ribution, according to the highest author
ities.
The War Department officials were un
able to hay who commands the Ninth In
fantry since the death of Colonel Liscum.
The impression prevails that the lieuten
ant colonel of the regiment is ill at Ma
nila and that the regiment, or what is
left of it, will find Its senior and conse
quently commanding officer in one of the
captains. Incidentally it may be men
tioned that through Colonel Liscum's
death Captain McCalla of the Newark, if
ashore, is the ranking American officer.
ARIZONA CHINESE
ARE IN NO DANGER
PHOENIX, Ariz., July 16.â In an Inter
view ancnt the likelihood of annoyance
of Chinese residents in case of confirma
tion of the news of the massacre at Pe
king, Acting Governor Alters said he an
ticipated no trouble In Arizona. Nearly
all of the Celestials in the Territory are
members of the Chinese reform party,
which is against the Boxer movement and
in favor of a modern form of Govern
ment. In case there should be- trouble.
Governor Akers says, the only available
troops are at Fort Huachuca, on the
San Carlos reservation, although more
could come from New Mexican garrisons
in two days' time.

CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLINGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, July 1 6.â
President McKinley on his return to Washington from Canton will give personal at
tention to many questions arising out of the condition of affairs in China. The situa
tion was thoroughly discussed at the Cabinet conference held at the State Department this
morning-. The general opinion was that the news of the next few days would determine
whether Congress ought to be called. If it should be found that the Chinese Government
was in no way involved in the outrages against foreigners there will be no necessity for a
declaration of war against China, and the President could send additional troops for the pro
tection of American lives and property and for the restoration of order by the same author
ity that he had sent those already on Chinese soil. ' â¢
Should it be found that the Chinese Government is responsible and that the allied
force in China is really fighting- the "Chinese Government, it may be necessary to have a dec
laration of war against China, and Congress alone has the constitutional power to make such
declaration.

ARTILLERY FOR
CHINESE SERVICE
RUSSIANS SAVED BY
A JAPANESE FORCE
WASHINGTON, July 16.â The Japanese
legation to-day received a cablegram from
the Minister for Foreign Affairs, dated
Tokio, iJuly 10, giving some belated de
tails of the fighting at Tientsin on July 3,
when the town was still in the possession
of the allies.
According to this cablegram there are
4000 Japanese 'troops at Tientsin. More
than half the allied troops in the attack
on Tientsin on the 13th, therefore, were
probably Japanese. The cablegram is as
follows:
"On the 3d inst a large body of Chinese
soldiers appeared' before Tientsin and at
tacked the northern part of the set
tlement, which was guarded by the Rus
sian troops. The Japanese sent to their
aid, at the Russian general's request, one
battery of artillery and two companies of
Infantry. After a heavy cannonade they
silenced the Chinese guns and finally re
pulsed the enemy.
"The Japanese losses in this engagement
were two captains killed and about thirty
non-commissioned officers and men killed
and wounded. Major General Fukushima
has now under him at Tientsin about 4000
Japanese troops."
thousand and twelve thousand men, the
number depending upon the regiments se
lected, and they will comprise all arms
of the service.
In view of the reports from Tientsin
to-day, showing the need of artillery, in
structions were sent to Major General
Shafter, commanding the Department of
California, directing him to select four
batteries of the Third Artillery and di
rect them to prepare for Immediate trans
portation to China. The batteries of the
Third Artillery, which General Shafter
probably will select, are A, C, I and O.
Battery C is a light battery and the oth
ers are foot batteries, but there will be
no difficulty in providing them with field
pieces and siege guns. These batteries
will sail with 500 marines on the transport
Hancock, which will leave the latter part
of the month.
ANOTHER BATTALION
OF MARINES WILL GO
WASHINGTON, July 16.â General Hey
wood, commandant of the marine corps,
is arranging for the mobilization of an
other battalion of marines for the Far
East. They will leave San Francisco as
soon as transportation can be arranged,
probably about August 5. The party will
be composed of one company of marines
from Boston, one from New York and two
from the marine barracks in this city. The
present intention Is to send the battalion
direct to Manila, but they may be diverted
to China for service there.

from shore that an outbreak was about to
take place. All the foreigners were called
out for defensive guard duty and they re

The men on board the ships kept close to
their guns and prepared to open fire at a
moment's notice, but the occasion did not
arise.

she heard of Colonel Lisoum's death in
China. Mrs. Lawton was greatly shocked
by the news.
HO YOW, the Imperial Consul Gen- i
eral of the Chinese Empiie. is of
ficially preparing to receive pass
port? for himself and his attaches.
In an interview with a Call reporter at
a !ate hour last night the Consul ex
pressed i lie deepest regret and sorrow f<-r
the turn that affairs had taken, and he
fc-ars now that his fellow countrymen here
may be made to suffer for the atrocities
that are being committed in China upon
American?. He says the result of the
j->rr?ent troubles may be a war without
quarter that will put in the shadow all
of thÂ»Â» bloody religious wars of history,
incluoir.g the driving of the Mo^rs from
Granada, the Huguenots from France
- nd the more recent bloody episode of the
.Soudan.
"But there is one thing that I feel
should be thoroughly explained and im
pre=s"d upon the people of California."
said the Consul General, "and that is that
the Chinf-se in this State are to a man
hr-:irt and soul against the Boxers and
the awful crime they are committing
against humanity. I have just attended
a meeting of the leading Chinese mer
chants of S-in Krancifco. at which it was
decided that they would immediately
close thoir business here if necessary and
offer their services to the United States
as volunteers to go to China and light

"Tfure is; a strong rear .in for this. The

from every position of power and trust.
Six months ag'Â» the nephew of a merchant

the Tartar rulers blame them for having
brought the foreigners into China. They
toy, "The Cantonese have traveled abroad
and have brought back with them the for
eigners and foreign way* and we will
punish them for It.'
"I have received to-day by the steamer

; tillery. for ever since the war with
I France there have been arsenals at work
j in China arming the Manchu Tartars for
the war that they knew would come. In
i addition to this there have been the lm
| portations from the gTeat German gun
I works, and I dare say that It was with a
! gun of German make, held by a man who
: had been drilled under a German tacti

; Emperor was killed. German officers
j have been drilling the Tartars and now
j the results will be seen.
"I asraln wish to impress it upon the
j American people that the Chinese of San
Francifco are as deeply Interested In any
thing which will put down the uprolling
! wave of Tartar or Boxer barbarism as are
{ any of the Americans. You may not per
! haps realize it, but there are here In San
: Francisco now three hundred Chinese who
have served under Dewey in different ca
pacities in the war in the Philippines,
and the merchants of this city are willing
and anxio-jF to organize and equip these
and other Chinese and place them at the
command of the United 'States.
"They would be of inestimable value,
for they could act as guides, interpreters
and advis-ers. and In a thousand ways
] they could be of advantage to an army
in the strangest country that ever Cau

"In regard to the report that Admiral
Seymour has been killing his wounded. I
think it Is highly improbable that he
I would have done any such thing and then
! made his report of It at Mich a late day.
j for it was t*Â»n days ajro that he returned,
i and it would be extremely strange for him
to withhold such an important communi
cation for euch a length of time. Of
course, if. It is so. it is much to be re
gretted.
"As to the lenpth of time that the war
will continue. When the powers pet
through playing with politics then things
will progress. Russia, though, has not
been able to withdraw any of her men
from the railroad, as the Roxprs have
been tearing up her newly built track and
have cut olT h*>r communication with her
base of supplies. For that reason the
Boxer* can count upon no support from
Russia, and I think that this war will
see the end of the Tartar dynasty in the
Chinese empire, which has been the ruling
power there for 400 years.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WEL
LINGTON HOTEL, WASHING
IXGTOX July 16.â Peking at this
moment Is not the point on which
the eyes of the administration are
centered. Tientsin has the focus of the
world's attention. It Is evident to the
officials that Prince Tuan understands
the necessity of uniting China against for
eigners, and, to accomplish the welding
together of the empire in opposition to
foreigners, the weakness of the latter must
be demonstrated. Consul General Good
now recently reported that the defeat of
the allies in the north would cause an out
burst of disaffection in Central and
Southern China. Prince Tuan knows the
conditions that exist better than Mr.
Goodnow, and he and his supporters are
undoubtedly making determined efforts to
drive the foreign troops to the sea before
such large reinforcements arrive that it
will be Impossible to defeat 'them. There
fore Tientsin is the point at which It
probably will be determined whether a
section of China or all of China shall en
gage in combat with foreigners.
The seriousness of the situation at that
point, as shown to-day by Admiral Re
mey's dispatch, diverted the attention of
the authorities from the reports of the
horrible catastrophe which occurred at
Peking. It has been known for'some days
that the situation at Tientsin was des
perate, but the true character of the
situation came home to the officials only
when Rear Admiral Remey's dispatch was
deciphered.
There is excellent reason for believing
that as a result of the dangerous situa
tion in Tientsin the several powers are
arranging to greatly strengthen their
forces there, and to protect communica
tion between Tientsin and Taku. Concern
is expressed over the possibility that the
Chinese will attempt to isolate the allies
at Tientsin, and by repeated assaults,
participated in by the hordes at Prince
Tuan's disposal, they will be able to ex
haust the troops, as they are reported to
have exhausted the guards at Peking. -
This will be by no means an easy task,
however,* as a dispatch received by the
Japanese Legation states' that there are
at Tientsin about 4000 Japanese troops,
under Major General Sukushima. The
American force consists of 2000; the Rus
sians have about 3000, and the British,
German and French about 3000 men, mak
ing the total effectives about 12,000 men.
This force is not strong enough to main
tain itself and protect communications.
The authorities agree that It is impossible
to order the position abandoned, and ad
ditional troops will have to be sent to the
support of the allies.
Secretary Long is one of the few officials
in Washington who believes the foreign
ers in Peking are safe.
"There Is no direct evidence yet," he
said late this afternoon, "that there has
been a massacre. On the other hand, thi
murder of the German Minister was
known at once. If the Ministers had all
been slain on June 30 we would undoubt
edly have been promptly advised. We are
constantly getting routine dispatches
from Admiral Remey and the consular of
ficers in China. If anybody could learn
that a reported massacre occurred they
certainly would have ascertained and re
ported the fact."

Special Cable to The Call and New York Her
ald. Copyright. 1900. by the Herald I'ub
llsbing Company.
SHANGHAI, July 16.-There are no
details of the massacre in Peking,
but the Chinese authorities, having
given out the information and being
alarmed at the effect it has produced, are
attempting to deny or minimize it. No
reliance whatever need be placed on this
further evidence of their duplicity and
unreliability. The object of these bo
called friendly offices is to gain time.
The most serious development of the
situation is that Chinese olliciaj sources
indicate that the Boxers have been ad
vised to come south and that they Intend
to make Ching Han Po. at the head of
Grand canal, their objective point. Five
regiments have started for that place
with the Idea of gathering recruits on the
way.
This is likely to be the beginning of a
big movement directed against foreign
ers in the central and south of China.
An Imperial edict dated July 3 has. Just
been received by the Viceroys and Gover
nors, ordering them to begin war against
foreigners without delay, declaj-ing; offi
cers of all rank who refuse to obey the
edict will be summarily executed.
Another dispatch, dated July 7, gave
information of the departure of five regi
ments of northern soldiers for the south
and intimates that more will follow.
The fact tha.t_ troops caji now be liber
ated is of course explained by the mas
sacre of all foreigners In Peking, for need
qo longer exists to keep large bodies of
men in the capital. . i< -
The gravlty~of the eltnatlon cannot be
exaggerated. Many of the generals in
command in Yangtse district are Tartars
and Manchus and are in full sympathy
with the northern rioters. Advices from
Newchwang report that serious fighting
Is imminent there. The Boxers are close
to the foreign settlement. The Russians
have barricaded the streets and loop
holed many houses.

SAN JOSE. July 16.â Constable Fred
Bergerot. who in a drunken frenzy
killed Joseph Cech and fatally
wounded August Berger, has been
charged with murder by a Coroner's
jury, and the chances are that a
double crime will be placed against him.
Special Dispatch to The Call
A meeting growing out of yesterday's
tragedy was held at Hales Hall to-night
to protest against the further holding of
Sunday picnics and excursions. It was
called by the International Denomina
tional Sunday-School Association. The
place was crowded. W. O. Alexander
presided. Addresses were made by the
chairman. Revs. Kummer, Slaclaren and
Burton, J. L. Vinderwerker and Miss
Anna Fraser. Steps were taken to form
a permanent organization. W. Y. Alex
ander was made president. A committee
was appointed to wait on the Southern
Pacific Company to see If excursions to
San Jose could not be stopped, and also
on the Council and Supervisors to have
legislation passed stopping Sunday pic
nics.
After a short deliberation the Coroner's
jury returned a verdict that Cech came
to his death from a gunshot wound in his
head, fired from a pistol in the hands of
Fred Bergerot.
It is not believed Berger will live. The
bullet entered his head, and his left side
is paralyzed.
J. S. Johnson Btated that Bergerot and
Cech had engaged in an altercation at the
bar durins the afternoon and had been
separated.
H". Y. .Liebenthal was somewhat con
fused as to what took place. He was
sure that Bergerot fired two other shots
at him. but the witness was undoubtedly
so frightened that he failed to compre
hend what was going on.
Dr. Seifert states that the bullet en
tered Cech's neck and fractured the
ppinal cord, and that death was instan
taneous.
John Duncan saw two men push the
Constable and his prisoner apart. No
attempt was made by either of the men
shot to draw a weapon.
John Maloney testified, as did other wit
nesses, that when the shooting took place
both Berger and Cech were standing still
some feet away with their hands at their
side.
prisoner. The Constable let go of his
mail and moved off a short distance.
Without speaking the drunken official put
tip his club and drew his gun. He fired
the first shot in the air. then lowered his
gun and pointed it at August Berger and
shot at Berger, who fell. Cech then
turned toward his companion as he fell
and Ltergerot shot Cech in the neck. After
the latter fell Berperot shot at Cech. but
the bullet missed Its mark.

about sailing. It takes an experienced
ma .n to navigate in the waters hereabouts,
ihe boat was ballasted with 600 pounds
or railroad iron and carried a hundred
pound center board. She was undecked.
I think that Kelly tried to run before the
wind up the river waiting for a chance
to tack. The seas were running ten or
twelve feet high and it wouldn't take
many of those fellows breaking over the
bow to swamp such a craft as Kelly
had.
"You mark my words, those two young
people are at the bottom of the bay, some
where near Red Rock, I guess."
Attorney Harry P. Dimond said in ref
erence to the affair:
"I thfnk that Mr. Kelly was carried
through the straits and when off El Campo
or thereabouts realized his position and
tried to turn and head the boat toward
home. The sail probably swung over a>
she came round, 'jibed. 1 as seamen call it,
and the boat capsized under the sudden
stress. Mr. Kelly and I sailed the boat
all last year and this season he bought
her of me. She was a seaworthy little
craft and Kelly though a not very exper
ienced sailor understood sailing fairly
well. I can't understand how he came
to be carried out of the cove."
Charley McNeill, owner of the launch
Norwood, who has been up and down
the river for years, fears the worst has
befallen Kelley and Miss Warren. Dr.
James F. Smith of San Francisco, a guest
at the Hotel Belvedere and a friend of the
Warrens and of Kelly, says that the lat
ter was cool-headed In an emergency, but
in an open boat such as he was in on
Sunday, presence of mind would avail
nothing against the heavy seas then run
ning.
"f'oor young chap, he was one of the
best fellows that lived, and I can't believe
that he is In all probability drowned."
The sad affair has cast a gloom over
this little town as the missing young peo
ple were great social favorites. To-night
tho wires were kept busy with inquiries
and the possible fate of Miss Warren and
Kelly is the sole topic of conversation at
the hotel and in the town.
Miss Bessie Warren was 19 years old
and recently graduated from the Irving
Institute. She was very popular with all
who knew her.

Mr. Warren's Appeal.
The following appeal for assistance was
received at the Merchants' Exchange yes
terday from Mr. Warren;
SAN FRANCISCO. July 16. 1900.
The Merchants' Exchange Association. Cali
fornia street, San Franciscoâ Gentlemen: The
undersigned would consider It a Rreat favor if
vour ofnee would call the attention of bay and
river Captains to the fact that his daughter.
Miss Bessie T. Warren, in company with T.
J. Kelly, left Belvedere yesterday forenoon In
a "cat" boat for a short sail and have been
since missing. A boat answering the descrip
tion of this one with two people in her waa
seen by several parties In the vicinity of Mc-
Near's Landing about 4 o'clock yesterday
afternorn 1u?aded up river.
Trusting your members, should they by
chance see anything of the party, will render
them asBlstance and kindly report any occur
rences to your exchance or my office, I am,
gentlemen, yours most respectfully,
CHAIU..ES A. WARREN.
r^ ELVEDERE, July 16. â Almost
UÂ«Â£v crazed with grief and suspense and
JLJ/ tortured by the uncertainty of the
fate of his only daughter Bessie.
Charles s -A. Warren,' the wealthy San
Francisco contractor, scoured the river
and bay from 4 o'clock this morning till
late to-night In a vain effort to find some
trace of the frail craft in which there is
now every reason to believe the girl and
Tobias J. Kelly, a young merchant of
San Francisco, met their, death during
the heavy *eas that prevailed off Angel
Island yesterday afternoon.
In the Hotel Belvedere Mrs. Charles
Warren, almost prostrated with grief, is
being tenderly cared for by friends who
are trying to keep from her the almost
absolute certainty of her daughter's
death. At the time of the accident Mrs.
and Miss Warren had been for two weeks
the guests of Miss Ilene Day, who, to
gether with Miss A. Smith. Mrs. War
ren's sister, is now caring for the grief
stricken mother.
At 6 o'clock to-night the fog rolled In
thick and precluded, all possibility of the
search continuing before early to-morrow
morning, when the launches C. MacNeill,
Norwood and Jennie C. and the yawl
Kittiwake will again start out in the
hunt. To-morrow they say they will find
some trace of the missing catboat, even
If it be but a floating piece of driftwood.
Yesterday there was an important
yacht race held here by the members of
the Corinthian Yacht Ciub and almost the
entire summer population of Belvedere
was afloat In the calm waters of the Bel
vedere Cove watching the big craft out
side. Among the number were \\ illiam
Warren. Mrs. Charles Warren, Miss Bes
sie Warren and Miss Edith Huff, their
guest, who resides on Webster street, in
San Francisco. Kelly, who was sailing
i his catboat., arrived alongside William
i Warren's party and offered to take them
I in his craft out nearer to the racing
! yachts. Both Mrs. Warren and Miss
I Huff, dissuaded by the threatening ap
i pearance of the waves in the bay, which
were being lashed into fury by a stiff
southwest wind, refused. Miss Warren,
I however, accepted.
Strangely â¢Disappear.
Kelly having taken her aboard steered
for the Raccoon Straits. What happened
after that no one accurately know?,
though a number of theories- are ad
vanced, the most reasonable being that
Kelly, who was not a very good rough
weather sailor, lost control of the catboat,
which was driven by wind and tide into
the treacherous mill race of Raccoon
Straits and then filled, and, being so
heavily ballasted, sank, bearing with it
the bo'dies of the two young pleasure
seekers.
At daybreak this morning three or four
searching parties were started out. Percy
Burr in his yawl Kittlwake beat up the
north shore of the river as far as Peta
luma drawbridge, but was unable to find
the slightest trace of the lost boat. The
launch Norwood, with Mrs. Charles War
ren and William Warren, brother of the
missing girl, on board, took the south
bank, into which all agree, with tho
southwest gale blowing, the boat, had
she not sunk, must have drifted. But
though they explored every inch, from
Goat Island to Vallejo, their efforts were
fruitless. The Jennie- C, manned by A. J.
and Charles Kinyon. also explored in and
around Marin islands, the Two Brothers
and Red Rock, but all in vain.
Dr. James F. Smith of San Francisco,
Kelly's closest friend, wired to all the
bay and river towns, but nowhere can a
vestige of the unfortunate young people
be found. All Belvedere now believe that
the boat sank somewhere between Angel
Island and Red Rock. This feeling is
shared by Charles Warren, the girl's
father, who, however, will continue the
search to-morrow. â¢ Mr. Warren has
spent the whole day on the bay, accompa
nied by his son, William, and neither
has hope of Miss Warren 1 Â« safety.
Rumor Proves False.
A rumor was started this afternoon that
the boat and two bodies had been found
in the- tules In the Petaluma marsh, but
this, however, proved to be false.
Tobias J. Kelly, Miss Warren's com
panion, was staying at the Hotel Belve
dere with Dr. Smith. While neither a
member of the yacht club nor a very ac
complished sailor, he yet knew pretty well
how to handle a boat, having sailed the
same craft in which he was yesterday nil
last summer. William Warren feared the
bay outside the cove, as he knew Its repu
tation for boating accidents, and warned
his sister not to venture outside the cove.
Kelly was agent for Follmer, Clogg &
Co., umbrella manufacturers, and also forÂ«
the International Shirt and Collar Com
pany. He' was a prominent member tt
the Cosmos Club of San Francisco, and
well known around town. He was born
in Santa Cruz County, was 31 years old.
STORM AND FIRE.
KINGSTON, Jamaica. July 15.â A letter
from Atrato, Colombia, says Bocas del
Toro has been visited by a terrific gale,
which destroyed many buildings and
banana "plantations. Immediately after
the gale a. fearful fire swept the town,
destroying its finest buildings. The situ
ation Is said to be desperate, the people
being demoralized.
The fire originated through carelessness
in the Chinese quarter.

PITTSBTTTtG IN SECOND PI/ACE.
NEW YORK. July 16.â To-night, in
the presence of 14,000 persons in
Madison Square Garden, Terry
McGovern of Brooklyn defeated
Frank Erne of Buffalo, the light
weight champion of the world. The end
came In the third round. It was a hurri
cane fight from bell to bell, without a sec
ond's let up except when one of the con
testants was lying on the floor of the
ring. â¢
McGovern used the tactics he said he
would. He rushed In on Erne at the very
beginning, and sent left and right In such
quick succession that Erne, fast as he is,
was nonplused. Erne undoubtedly is the
cleverer of the two, but his cleverness
availed him naught against the bulldog
rushes and fiery attacks of the little
featherweight champion.
Erne of course trained far below his
usual weight, as he had agreed to meet
McGovern at 128 pounds, which is five
pounds below the lightweight limit: In
doing this many believed that the strain
would be too mnch for the Buffalo man,
and that McGovern. who is rugged and
tenacious, would surely beat him dowri.
Many of the wise ones compared Erne's
reduction of weight to that of Joe Wal
cott when the latter trained down some
years ago to 131 pounds in order to meet
Kid Lavigne in the lightweight class.
Walcott made a mistake on that occasion,
for Lavigne cut him to pieces.
To-night Erne said that he weighed on
ly 126% pounds, but declared that he was
in excellent condition. The betting at the
ringside was 100 to 60 on McGovern.
Erne was in excellent condition and was
as strong as ever. McGovern was at
about his best fighting weight, 123 pounds,
and ho was never in better condition in
his life. In the first round, when Erne
knocked McGovern down with a blow on
ihe head, and the little fellow took the
count before he got up, the Erne rooters
believed that their man would win. They
believed that McGovern would lose his
head from this knockdown, but they were
sadly mistaken, as the result proved.
McGovern got up with a grin on his face
and sailed right in with terrific force. He.
played sad havoc with Erne's body and
was satisfied to stand blows in the face
as long as he could reach Erne's wind.
In the second round Erne broke ground
several times, but always came back with
a dangerous left or right for Terry's
head. The fighting was so fast that it
was impossible to keep track of tha
blows, but Terry landed three blows to
Erne's two. In clinches, which were fre
quent, both men were guilty of holding,
but McGovern was the onlv one to be
cautioned by the referee.- Toward the
close of the round Terry put a hard one
over Erne's heart and a stiff right lower
on the body, which weakened Erne.
In the third round, which proved to be
the last, .Terry fought faster than ever.
He was up to his man all the time, grin
ning when he got a punch as well as
when he was sending one in. When he
floored Erne for the first time It looked
as If the latter would not be able to re
sume hostilities, but he rose to his foet
fairly strong and tried to offset Mr-
Govern's advantage. It was a futile at
tempt, however, as McGovern soon had
him in trouble again, as he floored him
once more with a blow on the Jaw and
lfft over the heart. Erne got up on his
knees and rested on his right hand. With
his mouth wide open he gasped for breath
and tried hard to regain his feet. HU
mouth and nose were bleeding profusely
and in addition to his struggle for wind
the blood was running down his throat
and partly choking him. By almost super
human efforts Erne got to his feet, but
he was in sore distress. It was now
evident that Erne was a beaten man and
McGovern started in to finish him. Terry
sent a smash to the face which landed
on Erne's nose and with a couple of blows
the little fellow paved the way for a
knockout swing, but Erne's seconds, see
ing their man had already enough, threw
up the sponge and saved the Swiss boxer
from a knockout.
In the early betting McGovern was an
even-money chance, but he was soon
made a favorite at 10 to 7. When the men
left the ring to go to their respective
dressing-rooms they were escorted by a
Bcore of policemen, who had to fight the
crowd in order to make a passage way.
When Erne returned to the dressing-room
it was found that his nose was badly
smashed and his mouth cut. but no other
marks were visible on his body. As for
Terry the only mark hÂ» showed was an
abrasion of the skirt over the collarbone
on the right side.
Round 1â Terry rushed in and plant*! a lÂ«ft
hook on ErnÂ«'s face. He tried again, but wan
short Both fiddled and Terry Jumped in anj
sent left and right to head. Erne stabbed his
left and crossed his lead and then mixed â¢ up
at close range and exchanged lefts and r'.ghu
on head and body. Terry sent left to head ana
Erne crossed his right to McOovern, fioorlr.<
him. McGovern took the count, resting on on
knee and was up. then swinging left and right
to head. The fighting waa now faat and furi
ous. Erne's nose waa bleeding. After a rattling
mix-up Terry hooked his left to body with ter
rific force, shaking up Erne from his heels to
his head. The bell found them In a hot rally.
Round 2 â Terry rushed In. sending: both bands
to the head. Erne sent hta left to the face.
Both landed right on head and went to a clinch.
cominc out on the breakaway. Terry hooked
his ri*rht to the head. Erne countering with
left. Terry rushed In again and was cautlon*l
for holding. Erne swung a hard right on
Terr>-s head. Terry sent his right to the body
and Erne made a wild swing, which missÂ«d the
rrark. Both were fighting at a terrific pace an '.
thÂ« blows came aÂ« fast as hailstones In a July
storm. Terry was Jabbing and hooking left*
and rights to Erne' 9 body, while Erne was
punching him in the face. Terry took h!a
medicine with a grin and still kept hammering
on the body. At the bell Erne showed signs of
weakness, while Terry was strong and rugged.
Round Sâ Terry rushed, but missed a left
h^ok. ami then he sent a left and right to th>?
cheat. Erne countering on the neck with hi*
left. Terry put a straight left on thÂ« face an.l
a hard right en the body. Then he sent another
left to the face and, breaking from a clinch,
sent his left to the face. Terry forced :h*
fighting, battering Erne all over the rtng. an.l
with a terrific punch over the heart and a left
swing on the head he sent Erne to the floor,
where the lightweight champion lay for nine
seconds. When he got up Erne's face was cov

The Brooklyn "terror" pounced on his oppo

in the bank subject to the order of the ex

has been thought best to make the
amount large rather than small, and
what is not required will be returned on

will no doubt be cut down. It is expected

FROM HEARST'S TYPEWRITER
COMES A PROCLAMATION
WASHINGTON, July 16.â W. It. Hearst,
president of the National Association of
Democratic Clubs, has issued an address
to the Democratic clubs and societies of
the United States, which is In part as foli
lows:
The time has come when all the Democratic
societies in this country and all the patriotic
bodies associated with them should publicly
ratify the nomination of \V. J. Bryan for
President and Adlal E. Stevenson for Vice
President end to defend the republic against
the corrupting ppirit of imperialism. This Is
no ordinary year in American politics. Col
onies have teen established under the Ameri
can Mas without the consent of the Ameri
can people and in defiance of the constitution.
The unlawful and brutal policy of President
McKlnley nnd. his udvisers. involving the aban
donmrnt of the principle of political equality
on American fo)1. has been confirmed by the
Republican party in Its national convention.
The Republican party, under Us present lead
ership, is attempting to commit a hitherto
peaceful and Just nation to a career of Imperial
adventure and conquest. It has dinhonored
our flag and our national obligations before the
civilized world. It has made subjects of the
inhabitants of the American Territories and
has denied to them the wise guarantees of con
stitutional government. It has trampled the
Declaration of Independence under foot.
The humane and moral struggle for the eman
cipation of the neighboring republic of Cuba
was victoriously ended two years ago, and yet
our army occupies Cuban soil, and the politi
cal favorites of the Republican party plunder
the helpless population of the Island.
Against these new and dangerous policies â
condemned alike by experience and by Justice â
the Democratic party is exerting: its whole
strenKth. Its candidates and Its platform
represent the conservative spirit of the Ameri
can people and their faith In American Insti
tutions. They represent opportunity at home
as apainst advrnture in Asia; peace rather than
war. inspired by the lust of money; citizenship,
not subjecthood; a homogeneous republic, not a
heterogeneous empire; a nation of prosperous."

war taxes or a great standing army, leading
ultimately to military conscription.
In the presence of these Impending national
ovils, th* National Association of Democratic
Clubs calls upon all Democratic clubs, organi
zations and societies in the United Stales to
organize their forces for the defense of re
publican institutions. Patriotic citizens, re

The steamer Garonne, arriving to-day. Is
the first treasure ship from Nome, having
about $75,000 in dust from that place and
nine boxes of 250 pounds each from Daw

The introduction of the disease is
charged to the steamer Oregon. It is said
that on June 16 the Oregon arrived at
Nome with two well developed cases ol
smallpox on board, and the passengers
were forced ashore at midnight and soon,
scattered in the tented city.
As soon as the disease made its appear

took stringent measures to stamp It out.
but during the last week of June the dis

are daily making their appearance. Ac
cording to reports arriving by the Garonne

such that the military cannot cope with
it and General Randall has appealed to
the citizens-, asking them to organize and

Special Dlppatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, July 16.â The Hardy brothera
of California were to-day beaten by Col
lins and Parct after a close . five-set
match. Both teams played for the net
during the first three sets, the Hardy3
winning two sets to one. In the fourth
and fifth sets the Eastern team changed
their tactics, lobbing well and with great
success. The high wind greatly bothered
the Callfornians and it was .pnly by forc
ing their opponents to play a low game
that they secured the fourth set^ In the
Afth set the Hardy brothers led 4â3, but
lost the frame on a. poor decision.
With 5â4 and forty love against
them the Hardys pulled up the score to
their advantage, thpn losing the game and
match by the well-placed lobs of their
opponents. Bv losing this tournament the
Hardy brothers are prevented from chal

Mexican Silver Dollars Recoined Into
American Ones and Their
Value Doubled.
MANILA, June 10.â The large circula
tion ot silver money in Manila and the
Philippines has made an opportunity for
counterfeiters, and there is evidence of
one or more "gangs" in Manila and the
provinces who manufacture spurious
coins. The counterfeiters make Mexican,
dollars from a baser and cheaper metal;
the American nickel Is counterfeited, and
the brown five-dollar bills have been suc
cessfully Imitated. But the cleverest and
most successfnl scheme of all is the coin
ing of American silver dollars from Mexi
can silver dollars. The silver In a Mexi
can dollar, if stamped with the facing of
our American silver dollar, at once
doubles in value, for any one will give
you two dollars Mexican for one dollar
American. The advantage of this scheme
Is that a sufficiency of good true metal can
be obtained bv melting up Mexicans, and
when stamped with the American facing
the new coins produce 100 per cent profit.
Raids have resulted in finding several
basketfuls of bad money in the rear or
a Chinaman's house, and a Filipino was
discovered with several thousand dollars'
worth of counterfeit five-dollar bills and
a box of recoined American silver
dollars in his possession. The
Chinaman and the Filipino have
made partial confessions and given
damaging testimony. It is now evident
that they are members of a gang operat
ing on a large scale in Luzon, and in
which there are several Americans or
Europeans as leaders.

DENVER, July 16.â The executive com
mittee of the American Federation of La
bor convened in regular quarterly meet
ing in this city to-day. The meeting prom
ises to have Important results, as action
will probably be taken with reference to
the Chicago Building Trades lockout,
the St. Louis street railway strike, the
cigarmakers' trouble in New York and
the Coeur d'AIene affair.
The testimony given before the Con
gressional investigating committee and
other evidence concerning the Idaho min
ers' strike will be fully considered.
Several officials of the Miners' Union
in Idaho may be present to enlighten the
committee upon several points with which
it is not familiar, and it is expected that
tho committee will throw the influence
o_Â£ the federation In favor of the Miners'
Union.
Among other things, a decision is ex
pected with reference to making an
eight-hour-day test. The last convention
at Detroit empowered the body to choose
a trade in which the right should be
made, and the machinists and horse
shoers are both after the selection. If
the former are chosen it may jeopardize
the international agreement recently
tigned by them. In either case the war
will be genuine. The subject of raising a
large defense fund to be used in aid of
strikers will be considered.
The committee accepted the resigna
tions of Messrs. Lennon and Pierce to the
British Trades Union Congress, their
time being fully occupied with their other
duties, and appointed S. J. Kent of Lin
coln, Neb., and John M. Hunter of Spring
field. 111., in their stead.
Secretary Morrison of the executive
council submitted his report for the eight
months and eleven days since the last
annual meeting, showing the federation
to be In good condition linancially. Dur
ing the period mentioned the federation
has issued Â»XS charters, six of which have
been to national unions, three to State
branches and sixty-efght to city central
bodies.
The application for a charter from the
Paper-Hangers' National Union was ta
ken up, but was referred to James Dun
can for investigation and report. There
is every reason to believe that there will
be an amalgamation of the painters and
decorators, and In that event there would
be but one body instead of two.
The offer of the English trades unions
to build In America a John Ruskln Hall
and furnish the funds for the building of
the same was also referred, but will be
taken up again before the session closes.
The sespion is executive and many mat
ters which cannot be made public at the
present time will come up for action or
reference.
The Chicago Ruildnlg Trades lockout
was considered, but no action taken. The
matter will be taken up again to-morrow
as will also the St. Louis street car men's
strike.
To-night the members of the committee
visited Elitch's Gardens as quests of the
officials of the Colorado Stale Federation
of Labor.

COLEMAN, Tex., July 16.â Fifteen lives
are known to have been lost in a cloud
burst here to-day. Ten bodies have been
recovered, but only two were identified.
They are:
JOSEPH SPALH. leading merchant of
the village.
JOHN *"ULEISSTINE.
It is feared that many more lives were
lost In the valley below Coleman. The
cloudburst, which followed three days of
unprecedented railfall, caused Fords
Creek to burst its banks and rush
through Coleman, a. village of less than
1000 inhabitants.
Bewildered citizens, roused from their
slumbers, rushed into the streets and
were swept away. Many saved them
selves by catching hold of pieces of tim
ber and navigating them into eddies
formed by the swift current, where they
were drawn ashore.
Spalh and Fuleisstine managed to
mount their horses. They dashed Into
the water and swam their horses to a
house where four little girls were scream
ing for help. Kach rescued two of the
children, whom they took upon their
horses. The animals were swept away,
however, in a noble effort to stem the
swift current, and all were drowned.
Water has flooded the tracks of the
Gulf. Colorado and Santa Fe Railway for
miles around and all traffic is stopped.
ST. LOUIS. July 16.â A spec'-vl to the
Republic from Austin. Texas, says: After
several hours of incessant rain a cyclone
struck the town of Llano. 200 miles north
of here, last night about 7:35 o'clock. The
storm came from the sea and was wholly
unexpected. It demolished a number of
buildings and a large number of people
were injured, a few of them seriously.
The residence of J. H. Keel was demol

WILLIAMS. Ariz.. July 16.â J. M. Me
neck, one of the well-known scientists,
civil and mining engineer, mining expert
and distinguished representatve of the
Smithsonian Institution at Washington, D.
C, has met a sad death upon the bleak
desert of Southern Utah. On the 24th of
June a party of four left here for the
famous lost copper mine, near the south
ern line of Utah, which was alleged to have
been visited by one of the members of the
party and to be one of the richest proper
ties ever found.
After journeying across the Colorado
River, the Arizona line and near the point
of destination Professor Meneck began to
show signs of great fatigue, and requested
that they go into camp for a few days'
rest. This was done. After the professor
had regained his strength he started out
alone upon a nearby prospecting trip, ex
pecting to return in a few hours. As he
did not return at the time designated the
party began the search, and continued it
for four days unremittingly, but t>elng
short of water and supplies the party gave
up the search, reporting that J. M. Me
neck had lost his mind and perished upon
the Utah desert. This point is far from
any town or other place of rescue, and as
Meneck was without water or supplies no
hopes of his recovery are entertained.
Professor J. K. Meneck is one of the
well-known geologists, archaeologists and
mining engineers of the Southwest. He
was a a representative of the Smithsonian
Institution and was compiling some valu
able data for that Institution of science.
His maps of certain isolated sections were
considered authority and his writings were
extensively read. He was a graduate of
Johns Hopkins University, having the de
gree of Pn. D.
Great regret Is expressed by mining men
who were very anxious to receive his re
port on the mines that the rest of the
party say they will surely reach.
Meneck was a man of about 50 years of
age, well preserved and in the best mental
condition. Great surprise is expressed by
all who know him of the tragic turn in hia
brilliant career.

Anita Cream is more than a softening, soothing prepara- i / *]
tion. It is a medical compound which remores the blem- (^ffl
ishes that mar an otherwise beautiful face. Unsightly jj
freckles, brown spots, liver patches, muddiness, pimples, f
tan and all other discolorations can be removed by a thor-
ough course of Anita Cream. It coaxes a new skin. The
old skin, with all its blemishes, will gradually come off in unperceived
particles, thus leaving a new complexion as 50ft and beautiful as nature
designed it. There is nothing in Anita Cream to harm the most deli-
cate skin nor to cause a growth of hair. Thousands of users have
testified to the above facts. \

Ono of the moM dangerous and common
forms of acute nervous prostration is
known as sunstroke. Tho prostration
caused by overheating tho body does not
always result in sunstroke, but more com-
ir.only in milder forms of depression, such
as nervous headache, dizziness, faintness,
sleeplessness, palpitation; mental confu-

ors, flashes of heat and shortness of
breath at the least excrtior..
*11 of the above names are symptoms
of acute prostration moM prevalent dur-

The only sato course to taka is to
keep the blood purs, digestion good
and sleep regular. fio ramedy

this purpose. A doss of Peruna 6s-

Waldorf Astor is getting a good deal of roasting for
his treatment of Sir Berkeley Milne, but possibly the
uninvited nobleman deserved all that Astor gave him.
It is not likely that Astor, after requesting Milne's re

The trout fishermen on the Truckea
River In this State and Xevada are com

recently made by Deputy L. N. Kerchevil
These fishermen are known to the commis

past two weeks they sent quantities trÂ»
local dealers. The law prohibits the Â«Â«aÂ£
of .trout under six inches in length and in
every lot seized there were many of thÂ«
prohibited kind. The total seizures
amounted to about 400 pounds, valued at
about 25 cents a pound. These were Dre
sented to local charitable institutions
During the past day or so the fishermen
have been senumg letters to the Comm'Â«i
sioners to the effect that the seizures we'â¢

COMPLAINTS OVER
SEIZURES OF TROUT
CHINATOWN 0ND THE LAW.
I 7 ITH the excitements of the startling news
\ A / from the Orient on the one hand and the in-
creasing interest in the political campaign on
the other there i? danger that local issues may be to
some extent forgotten and that the movement which
has been ito well supported for the cleaning of China
town may ?o?e something of the strength that has
marked it ever since the quarantine outrage. That
danger must Ik- guarded against. The sanitary mqve
jnent must not lag nor weaken. Chinatown must be
cleaned up.
There is more than ordinary irritation to the peo
ple of San Frsv.ci^co in the fact that at this juncture
neither the Board of Health nor the Police Depart
ment manifests any intention to enforce the sanitary
regulations of the city in the Chinese district. Al
though every policeman i> a health officer the police
force in this instance appears to be waiting for or
der* from the Board of Health and the Board is wait
ing, seemingly, for another chance to spring Â« bu
bonic plague fcare. While they wr.it nothing is done.
So far from starting a clean sweep of the filth of
Chinatown there has not been even so much as an
effort to whitewash : t.
In this emergency the people look to the Grand
Jury with expectant hope. That body has the power
to make a thorough inspection of the buildings of
the Chinese quarter, to report all violations of law.
arid to find true bills against the violators. It is also
within the province of the jury to investigate the
course taken by the Beard of Health and the. police
and to make recommendations as to the best mean*
of rousing those bodies to a keener sense of public
duty. Prompt action in that direction by the jury
would be oi great benefit to the. community at this
time and it is to be hoped it will be forthcoming.
Whatever be done or left undone by the officials
of the city the issue has no;v become too serious for
the people ever to consent to drop it from considera
tion. Some of the most earnest and important or
ganizations of the city have 'taken up the work of
promoting the desired reform, and it is not at all
likely they will abandon it at this stage of the move
ment. The popular forces that demand a clean China
town have in fact enlisted for the campaign. The
sanitary laws of the city must be obeyed by the owners
of Chinatown property as well*as by the owners of
property in other districts. The enforcement of those
laws is the duty of the municipal officials and the
sooner they get about it the better it will be for all
concerned.

E. D. Bailie, her husband and their three

several years, and last summer she re

Miss Dr. A\ orley. leaving again for Pe

Two years ago her husband was ap

he held up to the time of the occupation
of that city by the Boxers. "
The last letter received by Mr. "Worley
from his sister was dated Peking May 30
of this year. She told him about the ap
prehension that had been felt there as to
the Boxer rebellion, and how she and her
husband had made all preparations for a
hasty flight from China, until the arrival
of the marines had quieted all the fears
of the foreigners residing In that city.
That was the last that Mr. Worley
heard from his sister and her family, an(\
he is convinced that not one escaped the

FASHION HINT FROM PARIS.
fl REPORT ON. RAILWAYS.
A SUMMARY of the railway statistics which is
to appear in the twelfth statistical report of the
Interstate Commerce Commission has just
been given out to the press. It covers the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1899. It appears that on that date
the total single-track railway mileage in the United
States was 189,294.66 miles, an increase during the
year of 2898.34 miles being shown. This increase is
greater than for any other year since 1893. The
States and Territories which show an increase in
mileage in excess of 100 miles are Alabama, Arkansas,
Georgia, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsyl
vania, Texas, Arizona, New Mexico and Oklahoma.
An evidence of the increasing prosperity of the
railways of the country is afforded by the fact that
the number in the hands of receivers at the close of
the fiscal year was 71, there being a net decrease of
23 as compared with the corresponding date of the
previous year. The number of railways placed in
charge of receivers during the year was 16 and the
number removed from their management was 39.
The operated mileage of the roads under receivers on
June 30, 1899, was 0853.13 miles, of which 7225.62
miles were owned by them. Of the roads in the hands
of receivers on the date named 10 had an operated
mileage in excess of 300 miles, 10 between 100 and
300 miles, and 40 less than 100 miles.
Other proofs of prosperity are found iruthe sta
tistics relating to traffic. The number of passengers
carried during the year was 523,176,508, showing an
increase for the year of 22,109,827. The number of
passengers carried one mile â that is,, passenger mile
age â during the year was 14,591,327,613, there being
an increase in this item of 1,211,397,609. The num
ber of tons of freight carried during the year was
959,763,583, an increase -of 80,757,276 being shown.
The number of tons of freight carried one mile â that
is, ton mileage â was 123,667,257,153. The increase in
the number of tons carried dne mile was 9,589,680,848.
The average revenue per passenger, per mile for the
year ending June.30, 1899, was 1.925 cents; for the pre
ceding year it was 1.973 cents. The revenue per ton
of freight per mile was .724 cent, while for 1898 it
was .753 cent. An increase in mileage earnings is
shown for both passenger and freight trains,
In conclusion the statistician of the commission
repeats his previous recommendations to the effect
that reports should be secured from express com
panies engaged in interstate traffic; that repo-ts
should % be secured from corporations and companies
owning rolling stock which is used in interstate traf
fic; and also special reports from corporations and
companies owning depot property, stock yards, eleva
tors, and the like; and tha^reports should be secure^
from carriers by water, so far as their business is in
terstate traffic.
The recommendations are deserving of support.
Since the commissiou has been established Congress
should grant.it all powers required to make it useful
in as many ways as possible. There is certainly no
reason why the interstate commerce handled by ex
press companies should not be supervised by the com
mission as well as that Handled by railways.
P^ HE Chinese royal family consisted
*1 originally in the present generation
***^ of seven Princes. Two of these are
dead. Of these Princes one only suc
ceeded to the throne. At his death his
son reigned for. a short time, when he
died, _and the throne was given to the
son of the seventh Prince, who is now
supposed to be in possession.
The present Chinese dynasty came into
power in 1644. It is called the Tains
dynastyâ the word "Tsing" meaning pur
ity. The royal family is not of Chinese
blood, but Manchu. The preceding dy
nasty was the Ming dynasty â -'Ming"
meaning bright. The royal family In
this dynasty were of pure Chinese blood.
For a short time previous to the Ming
dynasty the empire was ruled by a Mon
golian royal family, known as the Yuan
dynasty. The Yuan dynasty and the
present Tsing dynasty are the only
two dynasties In the history of China In
which the royal families have not been
Chinese. > /
Emperor Taokwang, who was the father
of the seven Princes of the present gener
ation of royalty, was the sixth Emperor
in the Tsing dynasty. He was succeeded
on the throne by his fourth son. Prince
Hienfung, who was known as the seventh
Emperor. This Prince married a wife,
and she had one son, Tungchi.
While his first wife was yet living he
took a second wife, Tsu Hsl, the pres
ent Empress Dowager.
Tungchl became the eighth Emperor. He
Is said to have been very wild and dissi
pated. His reign lasted but a short time,
and he died in 1S75.
The imperial family were divided as to
who should succeed to the throne, and
some time elapsed before the question
was settled. The Empress Dowager made
the selectionâ choosing Beileh Kwang Su,
son of the seventh Prince, Chung. To do
this she declared that Puolan, son of tht
second Prince, was disqualified because
he had accepted the estate of the third
Prince, who had died. The claims of all
others available, were simply suppressed.
The Empress Dowager showed a great
deal of tact In making this arrangement.
Before she had been taken as a wife she
was a slave. After her elevation sho
contrived that her sister should marry
Prince Chung. Kwang Su was the lssuÂ«
of that marriage, and by making him Em
peror she was elevating her nephew both
by blood and marriage. "With an eye to
the future also, the Empress Dowager ar
ranged a marriage between her exalted
nephew and the daughter of her brother.
General Kwan Slang. The Emperor and
the Empress are therefore cousins. There

Chinese Princes are not regarded With
any degree of awe by the populace until
they are placed in power. Very little at

very little is known of its members by
the populace until a change is made in
the ruler.
For this reason Prince Tuan. the sixth
Princeâ that is, tne sixth son of the pred
ent Emperor's grandfatherâ has never
before been heard of. lie is 'a man about
40 years old. has devoted his life to atn
letics and has always been a great fa
vorite with the young men of the nation
with whom he came in contact.
Tuan has a son 9 years old, who has
been proclaimed Crown Prince, or heir
presumptive to the throne. The young
men rallying- around Tuan's banner for
the purpose of a\-*>nping- themselves on

The Viceroys and Governors are not of
royal blood. The two offices are some
what similar, although the Viceroy is
considered somewhat higher in rank. The
duties of both the Viceroy and the Gov
ernor'are co-ordinate. Neither has au

ble directly to the Emperor.
THE PRESERVATION OF FORESTS.
tZ2R0M now to the time, when the conventions
I 'meet to nominate candidates for legislative of
* fices and draw up pledges for the candidates to
subscribe there may be no large and disastrous forest
fire to recall the public mind to the importance of
grappling with that evil as speedily as a proper means
can be devised for doing so. For that reason the
press of the State should at this time undertake as a
duty to keep the subject to the front, so that every
man nominated for the Legislature shall be pledged to
do his uttermost next winter to bring about the estab
lishment in California of some comprehensive system
oi conserving our flood waters and preserving our
forests. The issue is not in any sense a partisan
question, nor a local one, and consequently the sup
port given to any well directed attempt to deal with
it should be well-nigh universal.
Why should we wait for more fires to come to
teach us the folly of leaving our forests without pro
tection? Have not the lessons of the past been suf
ficiently costly and disastrous? The fire season of
this year has hardly begun, and yet already we have
had reports of flames sweeping fields, pastures and
woods in almost every section of the State. The
opening of the shooting season has in many localities
filled the farmers with more or less dread of dangers
from camp fires or from lighted matches or cigarettes
thrown carelessly on the ground. It is certain that
before the rainy season returns there will be lost to
California many thousands of dollars, and perhaps
millions, by these fires. It has been so in past sea
sons, and it will be so until some adequate method is
provided for preventing it.
If we undertake to achieve this winter at least a
start toward a comprehensive system of forestry, we
will have attained something of great value, for when
once a good start has been made the movement will
progress thereafter very largely of its own virtue. A
great deal of useful information on the subject can
be obtained through the forestry bureau of the De
partment of Agriculture, without cost to ourselves,
and in other ways valuable assistance will come if we
in earnest set about the work. The one thing of im
portance is to put an end to the spirit of indifference
and carelessness on the issue, and to begin to /deal
with it in a rational, civilized way.
We repeat that the matter is one the press of the
State should take up and impress upon the public
n:ind during the campaign. We shall have fires
enough between now and election day to serve as
object lessons to all who arc in need of that kind oi
instruction. The one danger is that what is learned
in 'the dry season may be forgotten when the winter
comes. For that reason the campaign of education on
the subject should be made now and candidates for
the Legislature pledged to do at least something fhis
winter in the direction of checking these disastrous
conflagrations.
type?
The issue cannot be evaded. Silence on the part of the association will be con
strued as giving consent to the practices of such men as Chretien and Rogers, and will
raise a suspicion that there are others in the profession who are equally guilty. Are
there not enough honest members of the bar to call these men to justice and expel them
from a profession they have disgraced by using its privileges for the practice of frauds
of the basest character? '
FOR HONEST POLITICS.
SHALL the Southern Pacific corporation,
through its political managers in alliance with
Crimmins and Kelly and the other ward bosses
of the city, have the privilege of fixing the Assembly,
Senatorial and Congressional districts of the State for
the next ten years?
That question is up to the better class of citizens.
It is for them to answer it. If at this juncture the
professional men, the business men and the Working
men of the party act with vigor we shall have a fair
arrangement of the districts throughout the State.
I? they are careless or lack energy, the result will be
a gerrymandering of the State which will give the
railroad and the bosses a big advantage in every elec
tion of. the coming decade.
Honest politics will always win whenever the hon
est people of the community are willing to attend to
their political duties. It will be the fault of the better
class of Republicans if at this juncture the corpora
tions and Crimmins and Kcl'^jbtain a triumph, and
they will have none but themselves to blame. A fair
opportunity is now given to good men to deal with
ill the bosses and the Southern Pacific touts in one
jiang and to beat them ail There is a chance to win
for honest politics a 'success that will be memorable
in the history of the city and will materially strengthen
the Republican party by winning for it the support
rf thousands of independent voters who will not vote
for men nominated by conventions that have either
been ruled by bosses or have compromised with them.
We repeat the question: Who shall redistrict the
State next winter? Shall it be the railroad and the
saloon bosses, or shall it be the representatives of
genuine Republicanism?
The importance of the issues involved in rcdis
trjctinp the State is well known to ever}' intelligent
student of politic?. The advantage which the power
to arrange the districts would j;ive to the railroa 1
sud its henchmen would be something enormouÂ«.
The corporation could well afford to surrender San
Francisco to the ward bosses for the sake of having
ft free hand to fix the districts elsewhere. Thus there
U'upon all loyal Republicans an imperative duty at
this juncture. The combination among the touts and
corporation tools must be broken up and beaten.
Crimmins and Kelly mu?t be allowed no chance to
compromise the party or to betray its candidates.

UPON the members of the Bar Association there rests a responsibility growing out
of the exposure made by The Call of the frauds in the Sullivan estate case not less
pressing than that which devolves upon the court. The men who have been proven
guilty of the frauds are members of the bar as well as officers of the court, and it is the
duty of the association to act promptly in punishing the offenders to the extent at least
of excluding them from further connection with the profession.
Of Chretien's share in the frauds little need be said. He has been proven guilty of
procuring a fraudulent claimant to the estate and of aiding him by the fabrication of ialse
documents to obtain it; and he has confessed his guilt. His offense is one otlhe basest that
can be committed under the "forms of law. It is, moreover, one which could have been
committed only by a person having the privilege of an attofney, and is therefore in the
nature of a professional crime. He is guilty not only as a man but as a lawyer.
Why has the Bar Association stood not only inactive but silent for so long a time
since Chretien's villainy was exposed and confessed? Why have no steps been taken to
rid the bar of such a rascal?
The case against Attorney Rogers lacks the seal of an open confession, but the
evidence of fraud on his part is nevertheless so strong as to justify;an'immediatejnyestl
gation by the bar. It has been sufficient to form in the public mind a conviction of his
guilt. Does the Bar Association purpose to permit him to pass unquestioned? Is it to
wait for the slow processes of grand juries and of courts?
Here are the facts The Call has brought to light concerning Rogers' connection
with the case. He went into court as an attorney for certain persons. whom he alleged to
be heirs of the estate. He declared in court an assured conviction that the claimant put
forward by Chretien was fraudulent; that no such man as Chretien pretended to have
found was alive at tjie time. Having made that declaration, Rogers afterward withdrew
the claim on the part of the heirs he alleged himself to represent, and in open court gave
his consent to, the distribution of the estate to the Chretien claimant, whom he had for
merly denounced as fraudulent.
Rogers swore he received no money for consenting to the distribution of the es
tate to Chretien's bogus heir. That statement is contradicted by Rauer, who alleges that
he paid $6oo to Rogers, and that the payment was made in consideration of Rogers'
agreement to let Chretien's scheme go through.
With the details of the case, which have been fully published in The Call and
proven in court, the members of the Bar Association are familiar.. They cannot be igno
rant of them, for they constitute one of the gravest scandals of the time, and are suffi
ciently contaminating to affect the reputation of bench and bar alike. Â»
In the face of such an outrage, the Bar Association cannot retain public confidence
if it remain silent. Is the association to do nothing to uphold the honor of the legal pro
fession, to assure the public^ that the bar is not open to thieves and rascals of the worst

Proxies sufficient to make a, quorum,
with the members present, were pre
sented. '
The name of James E. Moore was hand
ed in to fill a vacancy in the Twenty
eighth Assembly District. J. D. Maxwell
promptly put In the name of Lawrence
Hoey as the choice of the delegation.
Later on a resolution was adopted author
izing the chairman to fill the vacancy.
The issue is therefore up to Senator Sims.
Sims Elected Chairman.
Seth Mann briefly announced "that the
Democratic State Convention at Sacra
mento provided that the new committee
should organize and assume power on
July 18. He called for nominations for
chairman.
J. F. Coonan of Kureka nominated J. C.
Sims of Sonoma. Mr. Coonan said a man
was wanted who could organize victory.
He thought Mr. Sims possessed the abil
ity to achieve that result as he had
wrested victory from the enemy in So
noma County.
C. 0. Dunbar of Sonoma was especially
gratified to see the committee looking to
the north for a leader. Sims was spoken
of as a man who had picked up the ban
ner In Sonoma and borne It to victory.
E. L. Hutchinson, who ran for Lieuten
ant Governor against Jacob Neff, second
ed the nomination of Senator Sims on be
half of the south. Hutchlnson mentioned
that he had made careful inquiry to as
certain if Mr. Sims possessed executive
ability and had found the candidate
strong in that line.
There being no other nomination Sena
tor Sims was elected by acclamation, in
fact, no other candidate was thought of.
When Gavin McNab and E. C. Farns
worth made up the committee at Sacra
mento Senator Sims was selected as
chairman and The Call then announced
his selection.
Committeemen Coonan and Dunbar were
appointed to conduct Senator Sims to the
chair. The new chairman made a grace
ful speech, thanking the committee for
the honor conferred. He was doubly
grateful because he was chosen by men of
so much eminence and distinction. He
knew the position demanded great re
sponsibility and unremitting toll, but did
not shrink from the task, as he was sur
rounded by able adyisers and counselors.
To the mind of the newly elected chair
man many things presaged a great Dem
ocratic victory in this campaign. He spoke
eloquently of the Demicratic standard
bearers. "B. and S."
Reference was made to the omission ot
the Declaration of Independence from the
Republican platform and the fact cited
as significant that the omission occurred
in Philadelphia, where the declaration
was framed. He said t>ie Republicans ac
cepted the gospel of Mark without ques
tion. . Â¦ . .. rLi&'i*. iÂ£
Chairman's Bryan Panegyric.
The Senator tapped the reservoirs of
Sonoma eloquence in pouring out a trib
ute to Bryan. He said the Nebraska
man's hands were clean and that no taint
ed breath dimmed his mirror.
"Nature," said the Senator, "has been
kind to Mr. Bryan. She has given him a
tongue of matchless eloquence. She has
endowed him with rare and inestimable
physical attributes and brilliant qualities
of intellect." The audience cheered when
.Mr. Sims said:- "Mr. Bryan worships the
eagle on the shield rather than tha brand
The audience applauded vigorously
when Mr. Stevenson's name wa's
mentioned. In fact. the heartiest
applause of the session was called
out by the reference to the Demo
cratic candidate for Vice President. The
new chairman. was quite facetious at the
expense of Governor Roosevelt and In the
following sentence made a break which
will not help the Democratic party: "It
1b not charged that he (Stevenson) went
up San Juan Hill with a revolver In each
hand, a knife in hla mouth and a razor
In his boot."
The Senator spoke well of Thomas Jef
ferson and Martin -Van Buren. He re
viewed : the Louisiana purchase and the
Democratic double standard r of money.
He fancied that the Reoubllcan party be
lieved that the people of the country were
enchanted by the illusions of the Oriental
empire and was making the campaign on
that line. Â¦ The Immortality of Democratic
principles handed down from Jefferson
came in for recognition. In closing Sena
tor Sims advised the Democrats of Cali
fornia to elect nine Presidential Klectors,
seven members of Congress, twenty hold
over Senators and eighty Assemblymen.
Ho reminded his- hearers that red tire,
brass bands and burning eloquence were
all risht, but that victories were won by
organization. The new chairman said he
knew of no factions in the Democratic
party and would recognize no distinction
between Congressional districts.
Other Permanent Officers.
On motton of E. L. Hutchinson the
chairman was authorized to appoint a
permanent secretary and a permanent as
sistant secretary. Al UcCabe was elected
temporary secretary. Later on the chair
man's power of appointment was en
larged to embrace a treasurer, executive
committee, finance committee and such
other committees as he rhould dÂ»em nec
essary. It was provided also that the
chairman should be ex-omeio a member
of all committees. Mr. Sims was further;
authorized to appoint a sergeant at arms,
stenographer and^typewriters.
Frank Gould nominated Nicholas Bow
den of Santa Clara for first vice chair
man. J. J. Wells of Tehama nominated
K. \j. Hutchinson of-i.os Angeles for sec
ond vice chairman. Both were elected by
acclamation. Mr. Bowden made a modest
speech of acknowledgment.
Mr. Hutchinson of Los Angeles said:
"Thomas Jefferson was a native of my
State. I was born in Virginia, where
Democracy was born." Mr. Hutchlnaon
also spok<Â» favorably of Assemblyman
William Meade and Supervisor Jim Hand
ley of Los Angeles.
To Organize Clubs.
M. C. Hassett introduced the following
resolution, which was referred to the ex
ecutive committee:
Resolved, That at least one Bryan and
Stevenson Club be organized in every county in
the State; that in counties forming more than
one Assembly District a club be formed in
each Assembly District; that in the organiza
tion of said clubs the members of the County
State Central committees co-operate In their
respective localities and that credentials to act
for the Democratic party be Issued to the clubs.
signed by the chairman of the county committee
and chairman of'the State Central Committee.
Necessity of Registration.
On motion of Frank Gould it was re
solved that the committee should suitably
recognize the splendid service rendered
in the past by Seth Mann. The sugges
tion evoked prolonged applause.
Mr. Mann acknowledged the compli
ment in fitting words. He thought there
was a good chance of winning California
for "B. and S."
On motion of A. Camlnetti an assess
ment of $20 was levied on each member
of the committee. Assessments were paid
by E. W. S. "Woods and George B. Mc-
Cauley of San Jpaquln.
Thomas O. Toland,' member of the State
Board of Equalization, reminded the com
mittee of the necessity of registration for
the primary election. He apprehended
that the law permitted one party to con
trol the election In another party.
J. J. Wells of Tehama said there was a
constitutional amendment pending which
would relieve the interior counties from
the operation of the primary election law.
He remarked that the people outside of
San Francisco were opposed to the sys
tem.
6ri motion of E. LÂ». Hutchinson the
chairman was authorized tÂ« appoint one
man from each county to look after nat
uralization and registration.
On motion of Seth Mann the chairman
was authorized to fill all vacancies of of
fices and committees.
D. J. Mannix assured the committee
tha> Bryan would again carry Sacra
mento County, and the committee ad
journed. i
Contending Democratic Clubs.
The Thirty-ninth Assembly District ha3
Its own troubles. There are two Demo
cratic clubs contending for supremacy.
One club, known as the "opposition." was
organized by Sam Kohlman, J. Schwartz
and II. L. Bienfleld. The other club,
which is presided over by D. J. S. Potls,
temporary president, is recognized by the
county committee. This club, which Kas
STiO members, will meet Thursday evening
at Turn Vereln Hall, on Turk street, to

Congressman Kahn Indorsed.
Congressman Julius Kahn received the
Indorsement of his fellow Republicans at
a meeting of the Forty-second Assembly
District Club last night. The following
resolution was adopted :
Â¦ Rerolved. That we have observed the efforts
and zeal displayed by the Hon. Julius Kahn In
representing the Fourth Congressional District
of California In the House of Representatives
at Washington, particularly in respect to the
exclusion of Japanese laborers, with approval,
and believe that his course entitles him to the
highest respect and fullest confidence of the vo
ters of this district.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HEPUBLICANS OBGANIZE.
PACIFIC GROVE. July 16.â The Repub
licans of this town have organized a local
branch of the Army and Navy Republican
League of California, which they have
named -Lawton Camp No. 29. There are
already about forty active 'members, vet
erans and sons of veterans, and a large
number of other Republicans not eligible
to full membership have asked to.be en
rolled as honorary members. The officers
of the new organization are: ~W. P. Kins
man, colonel; R. L. Patrick, . lieutenant
colonel; R. C. "Wornes, major; B. P. Lo-
bier, adjutant; C. G. Chamberlain, quar
termaster; F. W. Hawley, officer of the
day: J. A. Beyneer. officer of the guard.
The league Â¦will hold Â¦weekly meetings
from this time until after the fall elec
tion, and, when the campaign Is fully open
will bring to thl9 place many of Califor
nia's best known speakers to champion
the cause of McKlnley and Roosevelt. Pa
clflc Grove is the banner Republican town
of Monterey County, and it is believed the
new organization, with practically the en
tire Republican contingent of the town at
its back, will wield an influence through
out the county that will prove a powerful
factor for Republicanism in the coming
elections.

The Hoard of Health has been gruilty of Kross
! eitraiagance ever since Its appointment."
| \\ hf-n Dr. Williamson came before the Super
! rteora months aco asking for an appropriation
I of Â£50,000 to carry out their work for the re
mainder ot the last flpcal year, the Board of
Supervisors saw fit to cut down the appropria
tion to J24.QOO. Dr. Williamson met one of the
almoot immediately thereafter and
caid !n efTeot: "You don't know what you are
doing in cutting down the Health Board in this
way. You don't realize the danger this clty
la in from a visitation of Oriental plaguo. You
will be lucky if you don't get the plague here
within a weÂ«k." WÂ» did get the alleged plague
hi less than a we*-k thereafter, und If the
Health B'-arJ is an authority we have it vet.
I was tolJ by Supervisor d'Anccna early "last
wofk that at last your board had what it be
lifned to be a livtns case of plague now In the
hospital. At that date the patient had been
rick two daya. It Is hardly necessary for me
to say that I doubt it. But I will say that
there are many Oriental plants wMch will not
li\e in this climate, but when tenderly cared
for jn a conservatory will thrive and do well.
the stigma of plague upon this community,
without success, there is at least ore man in
th" city who would not be surprised to hear
that they have at last found the true plague. '
more rartirularly If that case emanates from a
hospital within th*>lr Jurisdiction.
It has been the custom of members of the I
Hralth Board when questioned about the re- ;
fu^al of the alleged bubonic plague to spread, i
and become epidemic, to answer by saying that
the outbreak of plague In Oporto was precisely 1
similar to the condition of affairs here. I ask j
more than a mere statement for that fact. I !
ask for the production of any authority to sup- '<
port the claim that conditions were the same Â¦
In this city as in Oporto, or any other place. !
during an epidemic of plaeue.
Referring to the case of Dang Hong, who died |
May 2S. and whose case is set forth In the re- I
port of Pr. KelloK* as Case No. 10 in the "orls- !
tna.1 communications." as published In the Oc- '
ridental Medical Times fcr July. I find that Dr. :
Kellogg and the Health Board declare it to be i
a true case of plague. A morning paper In Its i
issue of June 1 declared that Dang Hong's b'Kly i
was embalmed on thÂ» nleht of his death, and j
that it was done twelve hours before Dr. Kel- j
loeg had an opportunity to take specimens frcm :
the glands: and I have authority frcm the pa- i
per to say that It was prepared to prove Its as- I
sertl.->r.. but that the board never disputed the i
; truth of It.
It seems to me from the brief statement made '
here that the strictures upon the Board of j
i Health made in my resolution are amply justi-
Bed by the facts.
Dr. Bazet as a Politician.
In passing- I wish to notice a recent outbreak
of Dr. Bazet, which was published In the Bul
letin of Julv 10. In it the learned medico be
wails the fact that the Board of Health lacks
an aggressive politician, and saye. "We are all
Innocent of the tri'-ka of politics, and so we
are imposed upon." And incidentally he con
signs Mr. Sanderson and myself to a place not
generally mentioned In polite society. Let me
compare the innocence of the tricks of politics
of Supervisor Sanderson and myself with that
of members r>f the Board of Health. Mr. San
derson took hi* Beat aÂ» a Supervisor last Jan
uary. aftÂ»r be'ng chosen for the place by the
people. Prior to that time, I am not aware that
he ever hÂ»ld any iÂ«olltlcal office. I was elected
to the office of Supervisor at the same time.
About a week before the convention met I had
no mose idea that I was to be a candidate than
the man in the moon; and I have never been
connected In any manner with politics before,
and have never even been, and am not now,
a member of any politcnl club or organization
liow about Dr. Bazet? He holds now the
position of a member of the local Board of
Health under a Democratic administration.
He held also, until quite recently, a similar
position in the State Board under a ReDub
lican Administration. Was he elected by the
people? No! He obtained his position by ap
pointment. A man who Is entirely Innocent of
the triÂ«-kiÂ» of politics does not usually get such
appointment*, especially In Democratic and Re
publican admlni-tratlor.s contemporaneously
How -dl.1 he get them? Ask a politician, I
don't know.
How about Dr. Williamson? He Is a mem
ber of the local Board of Health, waa a mem
ber of a former Board of Health, and while oc
cupying such position helped appoint himself
Superintendent of the City and County Hospi
tal, and calmly sat down to occupy both
positions at one and the same time. His was
!ndeÂ«-d a pleasant berth. For. as a member
of the Board of Health, he had the pleasure of
approving his own acts as Superintendent of
the City and County Hospital. Unfortunately
for him. Auditor Broderick could net see it
that way. and held that Dr. Williamson could
net bold two positions at once, so he refused
to a>id!t his salary as Superintendent of the
hospital. Dr. Williamson stood It for a while
but finally resigned. Were there any political
tricks missed there? Did the people elect him
to these various positions? No. he was ap
pcinted. Could he have obtained these positions
without a knr.wledire of the tricks of politics?
As to Dr. Buckley, he came upon the scene
nfter the bubonic plague, so-called, waa flour-
Ishlnz. and had no hand in its "Inception
Whether he ha* any knowledge of political
tricks. I know not. But I do know that as a
yarhtEman he ought to be familiar enough with
fresh, pure air to have no trouble in knowin"
when the ruble air law was brine violated iS
Olir.atown. and he might direct his energies
that way. with benefit to the city and credit
to himself.
Dr McCarthy. It appears, was also a mem
ber of a former Board of Health, so he cannot
claim entire Ignorance of the methods of poli
ticians.
Plague Never Existed.
*_ It Is not. however a question of Dolitlcs,
but a question of existence of plague In this
city, and of thÂ« oomj>etency of thÂ« Board of
Health I think It ha, bin riArly proven
that there never was a case of bubonic plague
h-re; an.1 I think It Is equally cWr that the
statement contained in my resolution as to
the Ineompetency of the Beard of H-alth Is
founder! on farts, and not fiction, to the ex
tent of absolute proof.
When the Supervisor had concluded the
reading r of his statement Reed Paid that
as the Health Board had demanded either
a retraction or a justification of Super
visor McCarthy's language as 'expressed
In his resolution calling, upon that body
to resien. It was but rijrht that the state
rnent as read Ibv McCarthy should be sent
to the Health Board. Reed's motion was
seconded by Hotalinjr. and It was adopted
without any discussion.
"\\^ tf HEN the resolution recently
\/\// ado P t<?d b >' Board of Health
\jf\tf calling upon Superviror Mc-
Carthy to justify his utterances
regarding the questionable methods em
ployed by that body during the recent
plagrue scare came up before the Board of
Supervisors yesterday it was ordered re
ferred to a committee. McCarthy, how
ever, objected to that procedure and asked
that the matter be taken up before the
full board, which was accordingly done.
McCarthy then read a statement in reply
to the Health Board's request for an ex
planation. In which he reviewed the events
leading up to and coincident with the
quarantine of Chinatown.
That the Health Board made a mistake
In asking McCarthy for a justification of
bis utterances will be apparent from the
etatement, which follows in full:
Cleansed Private Property.
To the Honorable, the Board of Supervisors
Gentlemen: The B.iord of Health of this city
an<2 county, at a neotinp held July 11, adoptel
fc resolution der.ouncinK sateiaents contained
In the resolution which I submitted to .his
board on June Ik as <J^lit*rate untruths an.l
called upon your boani "to require Supervisor
McOerchy to either withdraw his offensive
language or t-h^w Justification for his us* of
the same bey.nd the ebullition of his own an-
Lrldled imagination."
la reply th.-reto I beg: leave to submit to
your honorable body the following statement
lor your consideration:
During tha first alleged outbreak of pla^Je.
which Botimi*d under the present adrriiiiKtra
tlm of tttc Health I*partmÂ«nt, the lijarJ of
Ziralth, without consulting the BoarJ of Super
visors, proceeded to appoint about one lnn
tfred dfjiutu-s x<> clean Â«'hlnatov. n. They sjer.t
perhaps* a thousand dollars, which I believe s
most liberal figure, in Â«weeplnÂ«r the street* a:Â»'l
<lep<-*:t:ng chlorWe of lime therein. The
cleanfir.K of sewers probably cost nothing, a?
the city pays for water for that purpfcM. The
remainder of a large sum was expended .n
cleaning the private premises of property
owners in Chinatown and removing the nuis
ances therefrom. All of this large sum ut
money the taxpayers cf this city are asked io
pay-
Money Illegally Expended.
did the r>oar<l expend the city â¢* monsy
without even asking the Board of Supervisors
for the appropriation? Since they proposed to
tackle such a Job without the advice and is
elet&nee of the Board of Supervisors why diJ
selves of a fact of which they apparently wer*
Ignorant ttat It is not proper to ask a prop
erty owner in the Mission or other pa& of tn?
owner's premises? li I maintain a r.uiaanct
on rr.y property the Board of Health would
h.ave no authority to draw money from &e
public treasury to abate it. I quote this sec
tion of the Political Code referred to:
Â¦â¢Section 3C2S â Whenevt-r a nuisance nhali ex
ist on the property of any known resident i#r
eny property the owner cr owners of wh.ch
cannot be Jound +y either health Inspector,
efter diligent search, or on the property of any
owner or owners upon whom due notice may
have been served and who eh&ll. for ttareÂ«
days, refuse cr neglect to abate ihe tame, or
on any city property, it frhall b* the duty of
the Board of Health to cau*e the said nuitani e
to be at once removed or abat<Â»d and to draw
upon the grenerai fund for such nums ;u* may
lw* required for its removal or abatement, n>-t
to exceed $C f >0: provided that irbenever a larger
expenditure Is found necessary to bÂ« made for
the removal or suppression of any nuisance th-?
lizard of Supervisors of said city osid county
thall. upon the written application of thÂ«
23"srd of Health, by ordinance, appropriate
allow and order paid out of the general fund
euch sum or sums as may be necessary fir
that purp'Â«e and the Auditor fha.ll a. .-lit and
the Treasurer shall pay all appropriations of
money made In pursuance, of this section in
the earr.e manner as Is now provided by law
for auditing and paying demands upon ihi
treasury: said sum or sums so paid shall 1 â¢.-
said nuisance has been removed or abated .n
pursuance of this section and may be recoverel
by an action agaJnst such property. AnJ it
ehÂ«Jl be the duty of the City and County At
torney to foreclose all such liens in the proper
court la the name of and for the benefit ot
tuch city and county and when the property
Is sold enough of the proceeds shall be paid
Into the city and county treasury' to satisfy
the lien and costs and the overplus, if any
there be, EhaU be paid to the owner of thÂ«
jrcperty. If he be known, and If not. then Into
the court for his use when, ascertained. Th<
Board of Health Is hereby vested with power
to act upon, define, determine and adjudi;^
v : si shaJl constitute a nuisance in said clty
end county and to require the same to be
t bated In a summary manner. Any person
who maintains, permits or allows a nuisance
to exist upon his or her property or premises
after the same has been determined by said
board to be a nuisance and alter notice to
remove the earae has been served upon such
rerson, is guilty of a misdemeanor and shall
e punished accordingly, and each day of such
t>.:?:tr. '.<r, after notice, shall be deemed a
eej.-e.rate and distinct offense, and it Is tne
C vi'.y of the health officer to prosecute all per
sons guilty of violating this law by continuous
prosecutions until the same Is abated and re-
Bights Were Violated.
Flrttâ A* to the claim that the rights and
privileges of the Chinese race were violated
by the Quarantine:
I refer you to the decision of the Circuit
Court cf the United States, Hon. W. W. Mor
row. Judge, presiding; also to the following
sections of Governor Gage's statement to the
Vnited States Secretary of State. Mr. John
Hay. In response to the latter' s request for
& statement of the facts:
"Twelfth: That if the cases referred to were
genuine plague, even then the quarantine, as
conducted by the City Board of Health, in con-
Junction with the Federal Quarantine Officer
Is discriralr.aUng against the Chinese, and also
unreasonable according to Information derived
from the highest authority here obtainable."
Plague Premises Wot Isolated.
Secondâ Ae to my claim that the Board of
Health failed and neglected tc isolate the prem
li<-s wherein plague was saltl ta have existed:
I state that such Is the fact. There was to
case where premises said to contain a victim
of plague, was Isolated. The only attempt at
Isolation upon the part of the quarantine of
ficials was to separate Chinatown or attempt
to sej>arata It by a cordon from the balance
of the city. If there was any case cf isola
tion of private premises It was net made pub
lic and I would like to have the Board of
Health i>olnt It out.
Charges of Incompetence.
Thirdâ As to my charte that the Board of
Health and Its advisors are incompetent:
Dr. Klryoun. who was persistently held up
to the community by said board as a plague
expert beyond question, admitted to me pub
licly at a meeting of the SupervlBcrs at which
the Board of Health and many merchant*
were present that he never saw a human
being with bubonic plague \n hii life,
ing the alleged cÂ£*es in this city. He also
admitted thet he dlapnosed a Kitasato Â»peci
tr.en of bubonic plague, which w&* prrsentÂ«><l
to him by a former Board of Health aÂ» pneu
monia, and stated at that time that he had
Jetfre on the subject which he could read
which would, he Inferred, explain his connec
tion, but which In the Interests of the n-puta
tlon of people connected with the transaction
be thought ought not to bÂ« read. Why did
he not r^*<i them? Did anybody present ob
ject, or did Dr. Kinyoun. out of consideration
cf Ms associates, and out of the coodners of
his heart, wittingly accept the charge I made
acainst him to shield othf-rs?
As to the metr-ber* of the local board. I ask
where did r>r. Williamson get his medical edu
cation concerri'nsr the plague? DM any member
of the board Â«>ver see a human being with
the r.larue outÂ»iiie of the alleged eaÂ»es In this
rlty? Did thr-y erer even have an opportunity
to exajnine the undisputed example* of Dlague
bacilli, and If po. when and where? I refer
the board to the -following quotation , from the
Governor's statement to Secretary of State
Never Saw Living Plague Case.
"The rnedlraJ trentlemrn and experts of the
Pity Bnartl nf Health Â«nÂ«l the FMeral Quar
antine officer* who have ventured the Injurious
opinion which haÂ« spread broadcast over the
world the rumor of the existence of the dread

pl&jrue when It wans rapine In India and e!Â«e

eaf-f here not bubonic plarae."

ReÂ»lth refused to al!nw reputable phrtelans

M'CARTHY SCORES
BOARD OF HEALTH
The Board cf Supervisors passed an or
dinance yesterday finally accepting the
Hall of Justice with a vlev.- to Its Imme
diate occupancy by the various criminal
departments of the Superior Court. Mc-
Carthy moved that the architect of the
building furnish his certificate that It was
in proper condition to be accepted, but
Comte said that the time had come when
the city should enter Into possession of
the building whether it was llnlshedor
not. The architect, he said, was not in a
position to give a. certificate at once, and
to insist on his doing so would only delay
and complicate matters*.
"Let us accept the building," said
Comte. "and the creditors can light It out
In the courts."

"THE GREAT RUBY" MAKES A
HIT AT GRAND OPERA-HOUSE
The Frawleys' Production Is a SpectacularSuccess.
"The Liars" at the Columbia Is Very Enjoy
ableâPlays at Other Theaters.
The singing section of the San Francisco
Turn Verein will give a theatrical repre
sentation and ball in Turner Hall on next
Sunday night. The members will appear
in the two-act opera, entitled "Die Afri
kanerin."

ing statuary. These living representations
give close imitations of some of the most
famous works of art at the French fair.
Basco and Rice made a big hit last night
and the rest of the bill is good.
F.-How feeling makes us wondrous kind.
There was a constant ripple of apprecia
tion and murmurs of ashamed sympathy
with the unlucky "Liars," who lie neither
wisely nor well. We have all been there.
at one or another lime, but it is granted
that we do not look pretty on the stage.
It is a comedy. 'The Liars." but verging
always on tragedyâ reaching tragedy. In
deed, in its discovery of the rottenness of
the bafls upon which smart society Is
founded â expediency.
Henry Milter, as the tolerant, kind,
cynioal*. but true-hearted Sir Christopher
littering, gave a precise and finished por
trait of the gentleman. Mr. Miller has
nr.t quite recovered from the temporary
iiwiispoMti on which has affected his voice
of late, but it has slightly gained in tone
afrain. as or.Â«* was pleased to hear last
evening. E. J. Morgan, as Edward Falk
ner. gave an earnest, symmetrical and
thoroughly artistic rendering of the hero
who has fallen among "Liars." and who.
by reason of environments, passes by on
the other side when truth beckons.
Charles Walcot adds another to his ex
cellent gallery of old men portraits with
his Archibald Coke, who is one of those
uncomfortable persons who have neverâ
well, hardly everâ told a lie. He also,
however, is a victim of environment and
likewise falls by the wayside. Frank E.
Lamb gives an excellent picture of the
model waiter, who sees, hears, knows
nothing of what happens when he should
be blind, deaf and idiotic.
And the lady whose immediate folly
causes all the trouble. Lady Jessica Ne
pean. Really. Miss Anglin is almost too
clever in the part. She is in love with
Falkner in a tepid, unconvincing sort of
fashion and compromises herself by din
ing in Drivate with him at a hotel. At
lea^t she does not dine, but that is not her
fault. They nre discovered and the at
tempt of Lady Jessica and her friends,
who are all drawn into the scrape, to ex
plain matters to her husband forms the
plot of the play. Lady Rosamund Talton
U a thoroughly graceful part, as far as
It goes, for Miss Martinot. Margaret Dale

exceptionally large cast was acceptably
fllled. J. H. Ber.rimo does not seem quite
in tune with the Miller tone. His perform-
Society turned out last night in full
force to see "The L'ars" at the Columbia
Theater, so excellently done by Henry
Miller and his ppecial company. It was
truly a swell audience that greeted the
shockingly clever satire on the English
variety of poriety. for which Henry Ar
thur Jones is responsible. Society doubt
less wished to know how they do those
things in Kngland, and. according to Mr.
Jones, it peems they are an actual pla
giarism of conditions in San Franci?co,

Columbia.
rrS a melodrama one may legitimately
I demand originality not from the au-
I' thor, but only from the scene-painter.
"The Great Iluby." produced at the
â¢ Jrond Opera House last night, answers
this demand. The authors. Messrs. Ra
l.igh and Hamilton, have simply tacked
togetfier a number of situations para
phrased from Sardou's "Pattes de
Moucbe," from the sleep walking scene ln
"Macbeth," from the quarrel scene ln
"The School for Scandal," from "Home,
Bweet Home" and from Jules Verne. But
the ecene palmer, Mr. Frank King, has
showed considerable originality and de
cided skill. The lounge at Oakland's
l'am Hotel. Regent's Park. Lord's crickfct
ground*, Hampstead Heath and the mili
tary tournamentâ five scenes out of the
thirteen Into which the play is dividedâ
are really beautiful and would do credit
to any theater ln the world. They are
decidedly better than attempts which I
have seen at similar Bcenes at Drury
Lane.
The company is far better than the play,
even the little parts being played by thor
oughly competent people, .such as Mr.
\V_Uaee Shaw and Mr. Amoryâ the latter
as much at home here as he was 111 at
ease in that unlucky attempt at Touch-
Btone last year. Among those playing
leading roles Miss Van Buren easily
comes first; the ease, animation and dis
tinctness cf her Lady Garnett carry your
interest in a part that in less competent
hands could not have failed to be insipid.
Mr. Lackaye gave a capital Interpretation
of Prince Kat-simâ the only part in the
play that approaches to a character
ttuiiy and Mr. iieynclds was a most con
vincing villain. Mr. Roberts as the de
tective was reprtbseuly effective, and Miss
Evans as the romantic Louisa made you
fee 1 that the detective was indeed a. happy
man to get her. Miss Rlccardo as the
Countess Charkoff had the best and most
diflicult acting part in the play. It can
not be said that she made the most of
her possibilities. Her elocution Is some
what monotonous and her expression of
contacting passionsâ love, hate, joy, sor
row, hope, ftar-lacks variety and con
trast. Her outburst of grief over the
dead body of Hassam contained too much
nature and too little artâ a fatal defect
in such a situation, for it causes the feel
ing of pain to predominate that of pleas
ure in the breasts of the audience. If the
lady will watch the audience ln this scene,
some Fhe will hear laugh, while others
vill ga?p hysterically. That means that
something rings false in the acting.
The curtain ro*e promptly at b, the
waits were short and the play, though
Ions, was over by a little after 11. This
means pood management, for which Mr.
Frawley and his assistant, Mr. Philipps,
are entitled to our thanks.
Taken altogether. "The Great Ruby' is
a fairly good play of its claps, beautifully
mounted and capitall^acte^.
LOOSE GASCOCK CAUSES
PATRICK DAILEY'S DEATH
Father of Actor James Dailey As
phyxiated in His Boom on
Second Street.
Patrick Daily, who was asphyxiated by
gas in his room at the Webb House. 37
Second street, yesterday afternoon, was
the father of James Dailey, the actor,
whose wife Is May Nannery, the well
known San Francisco actress. These
facts became known upon an examina
tion being made of his effects.
Dailey, who was 60 years old, was grant
ed a divorce from his wife by Judge Budd
of Stockton ln September, 1S97, and has
been knocking about from one place to
another since. About a week ago he se
cured a room in the Webb House, and ac
cording to the statement of the landlady
was always jovial and temperate. The
body was found by Sarah Arundel, a ser
vant. It was evidently a- case of acci
dental death, as the gascock was very
loose.
Found in Box Car With Throat Cut.
When Thomas Rodgers opened the door
of box car Xo. 6C22S of the Southern Pa
cific Company, which was standing on the
track on King street, between Seventh
and Eighth yesterday, about 4 p. m. he
discovered the body of a man- about 40
years of age with the throat cut from
ear to ear. A razor was lying by his
side, showing that death had been self
inflicted. The car had not been opened
since Saturday. From the dried appear
ance of the blood tho man had been dead
for some time. There was nothing found
on his person by which to identify him.
The body is at the Morgue.
Louis Whltehead. alias Percy Williams,
an incorrigible youth, pleaded guilty be
fore Judge Lawlor yesterday to two
charges of burglary and was sent to the
Preston School of Industry, at lone, Amn
dor County. On June 12 last he entered
the premises at 2218 Devlsadero street, and
two clays later looted a dwelling at 60S
Powell street.
James R. Shopperson, who was charged
with having made an attempt to murder
James E. Sweeney on April 2S last, plead
ed guilty to a charge of simple' assault
and was sentenced to serve one month in
the County Jail.
Two Persons Plead Guilty.
Harry E. Corbett, Henry Schwartz,
Zick Abrams and D. J. Crowley have
again sued Chief of Police Sullivan and
Captain of Detectives Seymour in an ef
fort to enjoin further action on the part of
the defendants with the object of closing
the poolrooms operated by plaintiffs. The
plaintiffs allege that on tne night of July
13 the defendants "camped" on their
premises and prevented the carrying on
of their business. A temporary restrain
ing order was Issued by Judge Bahrs and
was made returnable before Judge
Murasky.
Poolsellers Sue Again.
The Joint committee having in charge
the arrangements for Labor day has de
cided to hold the celebration ln Central
Park. The programme as outlined will
consist of games, races and other athletic
sports, and a literary and musical enter
tainment in the amphitheater. The cele
bration will occur on Monday, September
3. Prizes have been already donated to
the amount of 51000, with more to come
in before the list is closed.

The Chut#Â« has a rood bill. The Og
dens presented a laughable comedy, enti
tled "The Right Stocking." The Black
Bartons made their reappearance and
continued their former success. La Lista
appeared ln some wonderful dancing cre
ations. Hall subduing Wallace, the Hon.
and the best numbers from last week
make up the balance of the programme.
Chutes.
At Fischer's Concert House the. pro
gramme was wonderfully varied and thor
oughly satisfactory last night. The house
was packed, and Edward B. Adams, a
singing comedian, made a distinct hit.
Violet Johnson, a girl violinist, played
several selections and was accorded five
encores, and Miss Isabelle Underwood
was as well received as usual. Kovelty
was given the entertainment by a sketch,
ln which MI55 Lenore White appeared.
The moving picture machine showed sev
eral war pictures, including the battle of
Mafekinc
Fischer's Concert House.
The romantic play. "Ing-omar," was pre
sented at the Alcazar Theater last night
to a crowded house. With few exceptions
the cast wns the same as when It was
played by Miss Florence Roberts and her
company iast season. Parthenia is with
out Â«'(iubt one of Miss Roberts' best parts.
She plays it with delightful ingenuousness
and gentleness and one does not wonder
at her being able to tame even such a
barbarian as Ingomar, which character
was portrayed by White Whittlesey with
the same force and vigor that character
ized his previous performance. He was.
suffering from a cold which somewhat
marred his declamatory power. Clarence
Montaine was excellent as Polydor, the
rich miser, and Howard ScotVÂ»was equally
good as the Tlmarch. George P. Webster
was Myron, Parthenla's father, and he
seemed to forget that the o!d armorer w;is
not a buffoon. Marie Howe and Lorena
AtTrood had congenial parts. Jeffrey
Williams should familiarize himself, with
his lines.
Alcazar.
Plenty of fun and good music make
this week's bill at the Orpheum a popular
one. The Cohens would probably have
been missed but for the reappearance of
the ever popular Lillian Burkhart ln
tights and a new piece. She is so clever
and handsome as Captain Suzanne that
one foreets all about the good things on
last week's bill. Stella Mayhew and Wil
liamson and Stone, in negro specialties,
are sure to become favorites. John Dona
hue and Miss Mattie Nichols, in song and
dance epecialties, give a good perform
ance.
Orpheum.
The comic opera. "Wang," with Us
pretty, catchy airs, was the attraction at
the Tivoli Opera-house last evening. The
reception by the audience showed that
"Wang" Is as popular as ever. In several
respects decided improvements have been
made. For Instance Miss Annie Myers
makes the best La Veuve Framousse
ever seen ln this city, giving life
and expression to a somewhat difficult
part. Little Miss Grace Orr, although but
seventeen years old. has her first leading
role as Mataya, Prince of Siam, which
she executed with great credit and for
which she received enthusiastic applaust.
MIse Grace Field is entitled to no small
share of praise, for without warning or
preparation she was assigned at the last
moment to the Important part of Gllette,
on account of the sudden illness of Miss
Georgie Cooper, who was billed for that
character. William Schuster. Tom Greene,
Miss Helen Merrill and Edwin Stevens
sang in their usual good form. Ferris
Hartman made no end of amusement in
his local hits in "Every Rose Has Its
Thorn." Wang will continue two weeks,
to be followed by the Tivoll's grand opera
season.
Tivoli.
California.
Norma "vThalley and Mathews and Bul
ger are the all stars ln "Gay Coney
Island" at the California this week, and
the second performance last night kept a
crowded house on the titter and the ha!
ha! The piece is plumb full of good songs,
Mi?s Whalley. in particular, scoring a
t uccess ln "Hiram," "It's the Man Behind
thÂ«Â» Gun That Does thr> Work" and "My
Automobile Girl." Mary Marble, Maud
Courtney and Mathews. Bulger, Hart
and Rylcy furnish the remainder of the
vocal music and make a successful treat
of what would otherwise be a very silly
and ridiculous performance.
THE THUUXING BATTLE IN MIDAIR.
(Scene from "The Great Ruby.")
ance is hardly up to their standard. Next

SERIOUS CHARGES MADE
BY A YOUNG WOMAN
Ten Dollars fpr the Trip, Berth and
All.
Lake Tahoe excursion travel Is receiv
ing unusual impetus this season in the
way of reduced rates. In addition to the
regular season ticket of $16 50 the South
ern Pacific has just fixed upon a ten-day
rate from San Francisco, Oakland, Ala
meda and Berkeley of $13 30. which affords
the usual rail transportation to the lake,
steamer trip around the lake and certain
stop-over privileges at the resorts.
A Saturday-Monday excursion has also
been arranged for next Saturday on the
train leaving San Francisco at 6 p. m.,
the cost of ticket to be only $10. berth in
sleeper included. The return trip, how
ever must be on the train reaching thia
city abftut noon of the following Monday.
All day Sunday may be spent on and
around the lake.
Ivake Tahoe is regarded as a world at
traction, quite Independent of the circum*
stance of rates, but with the cost of
transportation cut down to such amaz
ingly low figures it would seem that
everybody might go and enjoy its grand
eurs.

NATIVE SONS
RESPOND TO THE
INVITATIONS
Mrs. Angella Unus, an aged Mexican
woman, residing at 1325 Dupont street,
sought to drown herself in the waters ot
the bay on Sunday night. She was pre
vented from doing so by Policemen J. H.
Pearl and James Ward of the California
street police station, who caught her as
she was about to Jump from Melggs
wharf.
The story of the causes which led up to
the woman's attempt to destroy her own
life Is pathetic arid Involves a long tale of
family troubles, ending with the serious
illness of an only daughter.
Within the last few years all the mem
bers of Mrs. Unus 1 family have died with
the exception of one child. This child is
a daughter now 13 years of age, who waa
her mother s sole companion and comfort
Two months ago the girl was taken sick.
Physicians were called? but her ailment
baffled medical skill and she rapidly be
came worse, until she was finally removed
to the Children's Hospital, where she now
lies hovering between life and death.
The condition of her daughter caused
Mrs. Unus much worry, and of late she
has been acting strangely. Sunday night
she left her home, dressed in black, and
started for North Beach. When she
reached Meigga wharf she seated herself
near the edge cf the pier and gazed into
th* waters for some time. She remained
in the same position for nearly two hours,
weeping most of the time. Her peculiar
actions excited the curiosity of a number
of people, but no one attempted to ascer
tain the cause of her trouble.
â¢Policemen Pearl and Ward suspected the
woman meant to do harm to herself and
they watcHfed her closely. Finally Mrs.
TJnus arose, pulled off her shoes and
throwing her hat and cape away prepared
to leap from the wharf. Just as she. was
about to Jump the policemen caught her.
For a time she fought desperately, still in
tent upon taking her life. She waa at
length subdued and taken to her home
where friends are caring for her.

Captain N. T. James, commanding the

that at l^ast 200 men of that organization
would take part in the parade. The divi
sions at this port will be increased by
men from the divisions at San Diego,
Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz and Eureka.
During their stay here they will be quar
tered on the Marion. In addition to the
batteries the militia men will have a fine
marine float. ..
The finance committee, with President
Newhall, will to-day visit the local banks
to solicit contributions for the celebra

They Pleaded Guilty Before Judge
Mog^n and Were Severely Rep
rimanded by Him.
Numerous complaints have been mads
by subscribers to The Call who live in
the Mission district of boys stealing their
papers. Sunday morning Policeman C. W.
Drown, who lives at S4S0 Eighteenth street,
was on the lookout for &Â»s paper, as it
had been taken from his "doorstep three
timee last week. Five boys came along
in a wagon an<i two of them Jumped off
Â£.nd took his paper. He gave chase and.
Jumping on a passing wagon, captured the
boys at Twenty-sixth and Harrison
streets. Camillo Torrence and Otto Gercke
were the boys who stole the paper and
they were booked on a charge of petty
larceny. The other boys in the wagon
were Thomas McCormlck, Eddie McCar-
Thy and Henry Luhrs.
The beys appeared before Judge Mogan
vesterday. They "leaded guilty. They
had beer and wine In the wagon and paid

His Application for Reinstatement as
Lieutenant to Come Up at
To-Night's Meeting.
At the meeting of the Board of Police
Commissioners this evening the applica
tion of Sergeant Price to be -reinstated ln
blfl Con&er rank of lieutenant will be
beard. It is thought probable that the
application will be granted.
Price is one of the most capable officers
on the force and no man had a greater
I) v. . r to keep in subjection the high
binder element in Chinatown than he. His
work was keenly appreciated by his su
periors ar.'J he had a bright future be
: Â¦â¢ him. wh^n. without a trial or hear
i:.s. h<- was disrated and in disgust sought
retirement on a pension. Now that he
l:as b<rt-:i ordered back to duty he consld
? rs It Just that he should receive the rank
ot lieutenant.
A large number of leading citizens
knowing his worth as a police officer have
backed up his application and his ene
j:;:<s, if he has any. should show their
Land at to-night's meeting, as Price says
lie is prepared to meet them. The mat
ter is one of importance to the whole
department, as it will show whether an
r,f!iccr against whom no charges were
made can be disrated without having an
opportunity of defending himself.

Pfiuger Meets Disaster.
The bark J. C. Pfluger left here on the
11th inst. with 11,875 barrels- of flour
aboard. Soon after getting off shore she
ran into a northwester, and before a sail
could be taken off the vessel the damage
was done. In the twinkling of an eye the
main and mizzen masts went by the board,
and a portion of the foremast alone was
left standing. Thus crippled the bark
made her way inshore and was finally
picked up by the steam schooner Green
wood and towed into Santa Barbara. It
will be an utter impossibility to make the
necessary repairs at Santa Barbara, so
the chances are that the vessel will be
towed back here for an overhauling. The
Santa Barbara account of the disaster Is
as follows:
A Most Peculiar Accident.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., July 16.â
About 6 o'clock this morning the German
bark J. C. Pfluger was towed into thia
port by a steam schooner ln a disabled

and main masts. A telegram was sent to
San Francisco ordering a tug to have her
taken back to that place for repairs. The
Pfluger cleared from San Francisco for
Queenstown, Ireland, with flour. She had
just passed the Farallones when a most
peculiar accident happened. About 5
o'clock ln the morning, with only a fair
breeze blowing, the crew was surprised
to see the main mast suddenly torn from
the vessel and the mizzen mast snapped
off. The wind which caused the damage
was scarcely felt on the deck, and the
supposition is that it came ln the shape
of a whirlwind and did not reach the
deck of the ship.
With the use of the fore sail only and
with the wind in a southerly direction
the bark was sailed in toward the coast

near Goleta by a steam schooner and tow

day or two before the tug arrives to tow

on the second night their hearts were
made glad by n light which showed up
ahead. It was thought to be some ship,
and the men rowed like mad ln the hope
of rescue. It proved to be the lighthouse
of Lysan Island, whose existence probably
saved the survivors from a fearful fate.
"At Lysan Island there was nothing to
do hut wait for a ship to arrive. The Mc-
Nrar was to have taken a cargo of fer
tilfzer for Honolulu, and her men did not
expect to stay there lone. The addition
of thirty-three men to flhe population of
the island, without the stores which the
McNear failed to land, made Â§ shortage ot
provisions, and all were compelled to go
on short rations, as far as imported foods
were concerned. There was any amount of
eggs and good fish at Lysan. however.

"The bark Ceylon, in command of Cap
tain Wilier, arrived at Lysan on June 10,

nearly a month there. Captain Wilier
agreed to carry the men back to Hono

on board. Including his own. arriving early

said one" of them, 'were enough to make
any man feel bad. We had only a little
food and water, and nineteen Japs to look
after, and if we had missed the island
there would have been terrible times. The
Japs all behaved well and everything went

and luxury. Some couia not wait, ana
some in consequence found out to their
discomfiture that the settlement of a hem
isphere demands large plans well thought
out and put into practice by many minds
and many hands ln concert. In 1606 some
persons on whom Raleigh's magnificent
schemes had made a profound Impression
organized a double-headed company for
settling the hither fringe of the new
world. The London branch of the com
pany, including Hakluyt. Somers and
Gates, took for their name the London
Company, while the members hailing from
Plymouth and other southwestern parts of
England called themselves the Plymouth
Company. King James, his mental vision
blurred by dreams of gold, gave them his
bles3ing, and along with It a patent to the
greater share of all the land that now lies
between Maine and Florida, and was then,
thanks to Raleigh, known by the name of
Virginia. The London Company had the
zone which lies between Cape Fear and
the Potomac, extending 100 miles Inland,
presumably to the Pacific; the Plymouth
Company the zone between Long Island
and Nova Scotia, back 100 miles toward
the Pacific. The condition that neither
company was to make a settlement within
100 miles of any colony established by the
other company actually gave the inter
vening region ln advance to the more an
ticipatory and energetic of the companies.
At once, in 1607. the very year that Hud
son sought a northwest passage, both
companies hurried off their colonists, the
one to success far south on the James
River, the other to disastrous failure on
the Kennebec. It was New Year's day of
1607 that the first makers of America after
some delay set sail from the Downs.
They were a merry, motley company of
105 souls, catalogued by a member ofMhe
party as "poor gentlemen, tradesmen,
serving men and libertines." The ludg
ment of John Smith, the worthiest of them
all. is the Judgment of history: "A hun
dred good workmen were better than a
thousand such gallants."
Bartholomew Gosnold, the second ln
command, was possibly the best known
spirit in the company. He had already
made a reputation for himself to which
he never added by this voyage to an un
known grave ln Jamestown. A while be
fore he had been the talk of London. He
had shared in Raleigh's unsuccessful ven
ture. In l<!02 he had sailed â contrary to
all precedent and prejudiceâ directly
across the Atlantic, entered Massachu
setts Bay, named Cape Cod, discovered
No Man's Land and called it Martha's
Vineyard and planted a colony at Cutty
hunk. now in the township of Gosnold.
Massachusetts. To be sure, the settlers
would not be left behind when Gosnold
was about to return to England, and he
had In consequence nothing to show for
all hia trouble. But he was not to be dls
maved by disappointment. More eager
than ever to plant a colony ln Virginia,
he talked the matter out ln London: oth
ers caught the contagion of his optimism,
and It was his enthusiasm that filled the
sails of the Susan Constant, the Godspeed
and the Discovery and sent them sailing
merrily away on New Tear's day of 1607
to settle Jamestown In the early summer.
The commander of the fleet. Christopher
Newport, was a competent and conspicu
ous officer of the English navy. Fourteen
years before he had won renown in a raid
on the Spanish main. He was the very
man that brought ln the great Spanish
carrack for Raleigh. No wonder the Lon
don company expected of him such magic
feats as are achieved only ln the enchant
ed pages of the "Arabian Nights." No
wonder the unpractical fireside planners
of a hemisphere gave Newport nueh silly
instructions as called out from tho
doughty Smith the Judgment that the
London company was made up of fools.
Newport had to find either the way to
the South Sea or a lump of gold or one of
"White's lost colonists or else he would
better never show his face again in Eng
land. It was a hopeless task, but he set
nbout it like a man and won the confi
dence of the best man In the party.
Barely a week had passed after the se
lection, contrary to Gosnold'a Judgment,
of the malarial spot on which at once
they built the little settlement of James
town, before Newport. May 21, with twen
ty-three companions, started up the river
his name ln swirt succession to oblivion.
But, thank3 to John Flske and the newer
writers who count It no crime to be In
teresting, the reaction has begun. We
know* for certain that somÂ« of the sto
ries of John Smith are true. He had his
faults. He was Inordinately vain, as
Charming says. He had the Elizabethan
facility, too often fatal to veracity, of
unrestrained expression and bore perhaps
more than his full share of Elizabethan
exuberance of Imagination. But he was
not. as Deane and Adams think, an ar
iant liar. He was boastful and arrogant,
but so, too. for that matter were Joseph
of Hebrew fame. Napoleon Bonaparte and
many another strong and stalwart man
of history- fffcey do his memory an irre
trievable hurt who-pronounce him a Fal
staff or a Joe Sedley fleeing from Brus
sels at the first booming: of Napoleon's
cannon and then In later years daring: to
name himself ""Waterloo Sedley." Allow
as largely as you like for any swashbuck
ling tendency discernible ln his character
and you will still have left a hardy,
shifty, daring, ready witted. clear-headed,
wholly practical pioneer, the flrst of &
long line of. pioneers who have forced our
frontier line by successive stages west
ward until, according to a late report of
the Indian Commissioner, it has disap
peared into the vast Pacific.
Smith did more things of moment than
save the colony which would else havo
perished In the two years wherein he was
the actual as well as the nominal leader.
He sailed up many of the streams flow-
In? Into the Chesapeake Bay, and made a
map, still preserved ln London, and on
which there are no lies. A serious injury
by the accidental explosion of gunpowder
took him back to England toward thÂ«
close of 1609. and Virginia never saw him
more. He spent the rest of his days In
exploring the North American coast to
which he gave the name New England,
and of which he made a map, and In pro
moting American colonization by his writ
ings and his word3. Most worthily the
title of admiral of New England was be
stowed upon him ln 1616. and when he
died, ln 1631, a place was found for him In
the choir of St. Sepulchre's Church. A
witty and not wholly unjust Judgment
was offered of him In his lifetime by
quaint and pious Thomas Fuller ln tho
words:
"Such his perils, preservations, dangers,
deliverances, they seem to most men, be

KNOCKED SENSELESS
BY A RUNAWAY TEAM
Harry Smith, a Boy Bicyclist, Be
ceives Injuries That May
' v ;., Prove Fatal.
Harry Smith, a boy about 18 years of
age, living at 236 Fourth street, was prob
ably fatally Injured by a runaway team
attached to an empty coal wagon at
Devlsadero and Fulton streets yesterday
afternoon. The boy was riding a bicycle
behind a wagon to save himself as much
as possible from the strong wind. The
driver of the wagon saw the runaway
team approaching him and drew to tho
side of the roadway. The boy was right
in front of the frightened horses and was
knocked senseless.
A gentleman who was passing in *
buggy picked up the unconscious boy and
drove with him to the Receiving Hospital.
The youth's face and eyes were badly
contused, as 'were also his left lee and
hip. He had sustained other Injuries be
sides. It was thought that his skull was
fractured, as there was an ugly wound
behind his left ear. HÂ« was also suffering
from Internal Injuries.
NOR'WESTERS and a "southerly
set" have been responsible for the
wreck of two barks during the last
month. One of them was a Ger
man vessel bound from San Francisco tcÂ»
Ireland and the other was a San Fran
cisco owned vessel in the Hawaiian trade.
The latter vessel is probably a total losr-,
while the wheat-laden stranger ha's
reached Santa Barbara in distress.
The first is the German bark J. C.
Pfluger, bound from San Francisco to
Queenstown. with a load of wheat, while
the other is the San Francisco owned
bark McNear, bound from Honolulu to
Lysan Island for a load of guano.
The bark McNear was one of the best
known vessels that tradwd out of this
port. She was a sister ship to the Alex
ander McNeil and came here from the At
lantic many years ago. Some time last
year she went from San Francisco ;o
Honolulu and ever since has been wnning
between the Hawaiian group and Lysan,
carrving provisions to the latter place
and 'guano back to the plantations. As
a good servicable bark she had many ad
mirers. An account of the wreck from
Hawaii by the mail steamer Coptic says:
Strikes on a Bock.
"The bark Ceylon, Captain Wilier, ar
rived this morning from Lysan Island,
bringing news of the wreck and total loss
of the American bark McNear on Dow
sett Reef, near Lysan Island, last May.
The Ceylon brought Captain Johnson of
the McNear and the shipwrecked crew to
Honolulu, with three boats that were
saved from the lost vessel. The McNear
went on the reef at night time, striking
fo hard that there was never any hope
cf saving her after the first shock. The
survivors spent two days and a night Ln
the boats, before reaching Lysan. Tht
heavy currents that prevail in the vicinity
of the island were responsible for the dis
aster. By this time the McNear ha 1 *
probably gone to pieces.
"The wreck occurred at midnight on
May 14, after the McNear had made a
grood run from .Honolulu to Lysan with
ballast and a few stores for the residents
of the island. Dowsett Reef is about
sixty miles from Lysan. Captain Johnson
was just changing his course when the
vessel struck. She began to fill at once
and all hands set about preparations to
take to the boats. Pumps were kept go
ing while the boats were got ready. There
were fourteen in the crew and nineteen
Japanese laborers who were taken from
Honolulu, with a luna. to work on Ly
san, making thirty-three men to be car
ried in three small boats.
"It was 9 o'clock on the morning of the
15th before the boats were ready and Cap
tain Johnson gave the order to abandon
the vessel. The captain took one of tho
lifeboats with three white men and eignt
Japanese, and H. Golden, the mate, took
charge of another lifeboat, carrying also
four white men and eight Japanese, in
the dingy- were three whites and a Japan
ese. There was no land in sight and a
strong trade wind was blowing when the
men bepan to pull away from the lost
vessel It was a dismal prospect, for the
land sixty miles away from where they
started rises so little out of the water
tha* it can only be seen from near by.
Followed by Sharks.
"All day on the 15th the men rowed, fol
lowed by scores of sharks, which did not
add anything :o the pleasure of the expe
rience. ' When night came they kept up
their course, and another dawn revealed
no land in sight. The men say they were
beginning to fear that they had misseJ
the island and were lost in the open sea.
The small boats would not hold provision
for thirty-three men for more than a few
days, and the nightfall of the second night

from the northern gold fields after a good

passengers, and two of these went north
on the vessel, while a third say3 he was
shanghaied from Nome. The Lane left

north on the Mary D. Hume and assisted
In wrecking the Laurada at the Seal Isl
ands. His wife went north on the Noyo,
but left the camp as soon as the Lane
arrived and took up her abode on that
vessel.
Speyer arrived at Nome the latter part
of May and secured a number of valuable
claims. Later, in behalf of a syndicate,
he purchased the llterage business of the
Pacific Steam Whaling Company for 120.

ashore Mr. Speyer was Induced to go
aboard the Lajie and the next morning
he was at sea, bound for San Francisco.
He will remain in this city until the
steamer sails again. On this occasion
Mrs Spever will remain at home.
Mrs. Frame and her daughter were two
more passengers who came home on the
Charles D. Lane. They came from New
York on the steamer, and expected to be
come millionaires at Nome. They landed
all their effects on the beach and then,
becoming disgusted with the outlook, left
evervthing behind them and fled back to
San Francisco in the clothes in which they
stood. They say Nome is overcrowded
and unproductive; that no gold is being
taken out, and that death on a white horse
stalks through the camp. The men who
were working the beach sand did not
make expenses, while those who were
dredging the gold up from below high
water mark were making money.
"Nome, York and Golovln Bay, for this
season in any event, are dead failures,

New York Stock Market.
NEW TORK. July 16.â The depression caused
on foreign exchange by the sinister reports
fmm Â«'hlna had no effect in the local market
and did not hurt the American exchanges in
the foreign markets. Good advances were eÂ»
tsbllfhrd in London for Union I'acific and Bal
tlir.ore * Ohio betcre the opening here and ln
terr.fitlcnal houst-s bought freely in this market
of these and other stocks. Total purchases for
London account in thip market were estimated
at 40,OOCi shares. The movement in Union Pa
cific was the mains; ring of this market all
dtv. nud Baltimore & Ohio wns also an active
feature. The movement in these Ktucka was
primarily based on the estimates for the
ye-ar's earnings row made up. A statement of
I'r.lnh Pacific earning? having thÂ» appearance
of auth-rrity Ftate* that net results for the
year. Â«t-!ui>lvf of land sales, amount to over
|2fÂ».<<T0.aX', which would indicate a balance of
pcmethlng like 90 per cent for emmun stock.
Thl* FtatÂ»mer.t end the fact that !n?ide in
terests were avowed buyers of the stock gave
color to the reports that it Is to be placed
on a 4 r>er cent baj-ls.
The amount of speculation which has b*"Â»n
fcifed on supposed damage to the Corn crop
Â«af made obvious by the break In the price
stocks of corn carrying railroads. This helped
the Union Pacific movement and that stock
rocf an extreme 2*4c. Other rains ran from
1 to l*ic for the Corn Rrang^rs, Burlington
belnc conrpicuous. Rock Island was h^lrt back
by sympathy with the weakness in Brooklyn
Transit, which was a target for the bears
fill Jay ahd which lost l%c net. Missouri Pa
cific broke badly In the late dealings on <iis
eppointment that no action on the dividend
vu taken Bt a meeting: of the directors held
to-day. The extreme decline of "4c, coupled
with the weakness in Brooklyn Transit and
the Â£ifsr>oÂ«itlon to take profits, reactions of a
point were ca.u*Â»d In a number of stocks. The
closing wÂ»s heavy at the reaction. Outside
of the grangers, the Pacifies and trans
continrnttls generally. the market con
tinued dull and narrow. An early advance In
FurÂ»r wa* <5ue to the rise in price of the re
fined product.
The Hond market continued dull and prices
moved both ways. Total sales, par value. $930.

"WHEATâ Liverpool wai weaker. It was a
holiday at Paris.
Chicago opened at 78c. declined to76Hc and re
covered to 77!4c. The weakness at the open
ing: was caused by greneral rains throughout the
Â¦West and Southwest. There were no buyers.
Reliable private estimates from the Northwest
placed the crop there not to exceed 85,000,000
bushels, and probably less. There were large
receipts In the Southwestern markets and they
were freely sold against at Chicago. Toward
the close the pressure to sell subsided and the
market steadied. The American visible sup
ply decreased 795,000 bushels. The weather was
shower}'- The rains in the West and South
west had a tendency to weaken Corn.
In the local market futures opened lower,

CHICAGO. July 16.â Corn at the outset as
sumed the decidedly weak position which made
lt the center of attraction on 'Change during
the day. The opening was at a loss and early
trading Jammed the price still further down.
There was practically one factorâ rain in gen
erous quantities In the corn belt. Kansas espe
cially. September closed weak, 3%@Hc under
Saturday at 40?Â»'S41c
In Wheat It was a case of holders continuing
to let go, while there was a small short in
terest to absorb offerings. The selling en
couragement was found In the Corn weakness,
in weak cable* from Liverpool and In rains
in the Northwest and continued more favora
ble rer>orts from that section of country. As
In Corn there was some recovery from the
bottom, but thÂ« close was weak. September %
i&.\c under Saturday at 77Hc.
Oats acted in sympathy with Corn, but were
comparatively steady and rather quiet. Sep
tember closed lower at 24c.
The Provisions market broke with Corn, but
rallied a Mttle from the bottom and closed
steady at a fair decline from Saturday. Sep

A traveler returning from Siberia says:
"The prisoners are not chained. They eat
at the same table with their guards. The
Government provides a pension of $6 a
month to the family of each prisoner. At
the expiration of his sentence the prisoner
can take up his home in Siberia and the
Government will assist him. It allows him
a- home and Implements with which to
Â¦work."

CANNON SEES NO NEED
OF AN EXTRA SESSION
WASHINGTON. July lG.-Representa
tlve Cannon of Illinois, chairman of the
House Committee on Appropriations,
when asked to-day if there would be an
extra session of Congress, said:
"That is for the President to say, but I
hardly see-'S.ny occasion for It yet. The
first thing to do Is to learn who is respon
sible for this trouble. When this Is set
tled we may be In a position to say
whether or not we are to have a war
with China. The present law limits the
number of troops to 100,000, and without
action by Congress there could be no In
crease of the army beyond that force.
But In case of emergency there are provi
sions of the statute which give the
President means of raising 1 funds to meet
the necessities of the case. There Is am
ple money to carry out whatever course
may become necessary, and you may
rest assured the money will be made
available. If there is any emergency
need of troops we have a large force . la
the Philippines which would be drawn
upon."
OAKLAND. July 16.â In anticipation of
possible disturbances on the water front
because of a strike of longshoremen, po
licemen were put on watch to-night at
Adams' wharves. To-day the notice from
the Longshoremen's Union that laborers
should receive f 2 50 a day for nine hours;
work went Into effect. The rate has been
$2 for ten hours' work. Several of the
lumber dealers refused to meet the de
mand. At the Humboldt- Lumber Com
pany's yard half a dosen men walked out
and seven laborers employed by E. B. &
A. L. Stone went on strike. At the Puget
Sound Lumber Company's yards the raise
was allowed while vessels now at docks
are being discharged. The men affected
are not steadily employed. The.y claim
that they had given ample notice of the
demand for a raise.
"The lumber dealers will not recognize
the demand permanently," said E. B.
Stone to-night. "We have voluntarily
rsilsed our men from $1 n> a day to Â»2. and
that we consider Is sufficient wage3 for
the labor. I do not apprehend any
trouble, as I am satisfied the matter will
be settled In a day or two. The men who
quit are not regular employes. They are
picked up along the water front whenever
there Is work to be done. The men who
struck are not skilled handlers of cargo.
The lumbermen have asked for a nine
hour day at $4." *

SERIOUS FALL OF A
PROMINENT RANCHER
OAKLAND. July 16.â Jefferson McKIn
ney, an aged farmer of Haywards, fell
fronva tree in his orchard to-day, receiv
ing probably fatal Injuries. Dr. A. J.
Dean attended the rancher, but could give
little hope for his ' recovery. McKInney

George Herbert Simpson, the 20-year-o!d
'son of Peter George Simpson of 2426 Ful
ton Ftreet, Berkeley, was declared Insane
to-day by Drs. Ewer and Dunn, acting as
a Board of Lunacy Commissioners, and
later committed by Judge Greene to the
State Insane Asylum at Stockton.
I The case of young Simpson Is that of an
| exceptionally bright mind wrecked :
j through overstudy and illness". At 14 years :
( cf age Simpson had completed a course
at the Berkeley High School and was pre
pared to enter the State University. He
was especially well versed in Latin. Greek
! and th" classics. His weak constitution,
however, was unable to stand the strain. I
and it was found necessary for him to dis
continue his studies for a time. He was
i eent to the country, in the hope that with
i plenty of recreation and fresh air he
| would soon rally. An attack of fever, how- ]
ever, completed the breaking down of his
, mental faculties. The vour.g man never
; regained full possession of his reason and
Â¦ has fince been subject to delusions of vrf-
I rious kinds. One of the vagaries of his j
j mind ls= that there is a Spanish lady wait- i
I Ing at his bedside every morning, threat
j ening to do him injury. His talk is Inco
j berent and Is of a philosophical trend.

TOO MUCH STUDY
WRECKS MIND OF
TALENTED YOUTH
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
HIS Broadway, July 16.
While working on a thrasher near
Mount Eden to-day John Krancis was
caught in the teeth of a cog cylinder and
one leg was drawn Into the swiftly re
volving machine. That the unfortunate
man was not ground to doath in a horfisjit
manner was due to his presence of mtnd.
Despite the Intense pain and the peril
of his position, Francis, by main strength,
managed to free himself from the clutches
of the steel teeth and to save himself
j from being drawn between the grinding
wheels of the swiftly running machine.
So severe was the shock that no sooner
had the farmer freed himself than he col
lapsed and fell unconscious to the ground.
j Assistance was speedily at hand and
Francis was taken to Haywards, where
Dr. Dean operated upon the badly man
gled limb. Whother amputation shall be
necossary cannot be determined for sev
eral days. Francis was so prostrated by
his suffering that severe surgical work
was out of the question until the effect of
the fhock shall have passed off to some
j extent.
Francis had been oiling: some of the run
' nine gear of the thrasher when he slipped.
Ills' overalls were caught in the cogs and
before he could cry a warning one leg
was crushed and he was In immediate
danger of having his body horribly
ground In the heavy machinery. The leg
was crushed and bones were broken as
if on a rock. He suffered .seriouslv from
hemorrhage from the ugly wounds, and
this combined with the severe shock
served to greatly weaken him.
After the physicians had rendered all
needful present assistance Francis was
removed to his home in Decoto. He has
a family dependent upon him.

Effort to Prove Him Guilty
of Goebel's Murder.
GEORGETOWN, Ky.. July IS.-When
the trial of former Secretary of State Ca-
Itb Powers, chained with being' accessory
to the Goebel murder, was resumed thi?
morning a letter signed by Cateb Powers.
in which the exxwesston was used. "I have
had a hard time cettir.s Taylor and others
to ?*.art. but tht-y are all right now and
this thir.g will soon end." was filed and
made a part'of the record.
JamÂ»-f= Esgleston of Frankfort was or
flered to bring ir.to court the railroad reg
ister showing the time of arrival and de
parture of trains at Frankfort the day of
the assassination. The purpose of this is
to contradict the claim of the defense that
Jim Howard; who is alleged to have fired
the shot; arrived after the assassination.
The defense objected to several tele
prams that w-=Te introduced in evidence
because th*>y v.ere only copies. The ob
jection was overruled. The first tele
prams read were from Powprs to the va
rious captains charged with the business
of pptiing u\t the excursion of mountain
nr'n to Frankfort; and most of them read:
Â¦'How many can you insure from your
county? Wire immediately. C. Powers."
A recess was then taken.

CLOSE FIGHT IN IDAHO.
POCATELLO. Idaho. July 16.â Tho

assemble here to-morrow. It is claimed
a fusion will be effected and that all

Questions at issue. Principal among them
Is that cf nominating a candidate for

Â«.;ated. The fight is v< ry close and both
eidos* claim they will win. Dubois con
. fidently aspects to be nominated If that
plan Is adopted.
His Silver Republican supporters claim
there will be no fupion if the plan fails.
Other qudtloni arc overshadowed by this

WjlP. 'Wasrstaff, a prominent official of
the East Indian Railway, with headquar
ters at Bombay, arrived on the Coptic yes
terday en route to London and is stopping
at the Occidental. The gentleman was not
inclined to talk much about the famine
conditions In India, but acknowledged that
they were bad. - i
"There is no denying the unhappy con
ditions existing there," said he. "but they
are no worse than they have been before.
This, however, does not better the situa
tion. The most serious phase of the fam
ine at this time is the continued absence
of rain at a time when It should be plen
tiful. The regular rainy season begins In
June and lasts until October. Thus far
this year the rains have not come, and If
there should be another year of drought
It Is hard to say what would happen. The
situation would be decidedly grave.
"This failure of the crops does not affect
the whole country, but is confined to the
central and western portions. - Crops will
be produced in the other districts, but the
burden on these more prosperous sections
will be great, to say the least. Plenty of
rain is all that will prevent a dire Increase
In the present great evils of the famine.
We can only hope the rains will come."
The railroad ot' which Mr. Wagstaflj is
an official is. he declares, the only one of
its kind In the world. It is operated and
owned by the Government, has Its own
coal mines and transports "goods and per
sons" cheaper than any other railroad In

SERIOUS EVILS
SURGEON General George M. Stern
berg of the United States Army ar
rived in the city yesterday and is at
the Palace. His appearance here is
for the the Inspection of the military hos
pital at the Presidio.
"My journey will extend no farther
west than this city," said the general. "I
am on a tour of inspection of the princi
pal hospitals of the country, and will
start for W*ashington in a few days."
In reply to a question as to the condl
tion and facilities of the hospital service
in this country and in the Philippines Gen
eral Sternberg said:
"At the outbreak of the war with Spain
we had a corps of army surgeons calcu
lated only for an army of 25.000 men. and
the requirements had to be met by em
ploying contract surgeens from the ranks
of civilians. In the regular army these
numbered 407, or more than twice the
number of regulars. In addition to this
each volunteer regiment had three doc
tors, Â«.o we were enabled to handle the
work readily. We have a large hospital
supply depot in this city and one in New
York." From the latter shipments are made
by way ci the Suez Canal. The depot
here, however, i* the most important, and
we are fully equipped for all demands that
may be made upon this department.
Wherever there is a movement of troops
there is alwavs a full stock of medical
supplies and the required surgeons.
"At the Presidio of San Francisco is
located the most important hospital in
the country, and it is one of the largest,
most modern and best equipped in
stitution? of its kind ever constructed.
This receives the 6ick soldiers from the
Philippines, and they are given the best
attention possible, and when convalescent
are placed in the convalescent regiments
until tuch time as they are discharged for
sent back to their own regiments.
"In Fort Bayard. New Mexico, the Gov
ernment has a new hospital for consump
tives. It is situated 5000 feet above the
sea level and offers the best conditions
possible for fighting this dread disease.
The institution has been but recently
opened, and on my visit there a fe%v day?
ago there wore ninety patients. In Hot
Springs, Arkansas, is located the army
and navy general hospital, and there is
the national hospital at Washington, D.
C, besides those at each army post.
â¢'As to the Philippines, the facilities are
all that are required. We have several
large hospitals there with the most mod
ern improvements, both as to scientific
appliances, trained nurses and supplies.
They are equal to any demands that may
be made upon them. The Chinese troubles
have also called for prompt attention. 1
have a dispatch that has not yet been
made public in which the chief surgeon at
Manila notifies me that he hassent a 300
bc-d I'.eld hospital to China and medical
supplies for 6000 men for three months.
In addition to this the hospital ship Re
lief, the best of its kind afloat, has been
dispatched to Taku. She has a full corps
of doctors and nurse?, and is in command
of Surgeon Major Perley. Our hospital
service is thoroughly modern in every
respect, and, so far as capacity la con
cerned, is fully prepared to care for the
sick and wounded soldiers of our armies,
wherever they may be."
When told* of â¢ the fatalities among
American troops In the attack upon
Tientsin, reported yesterday by cable,
General Sternberg was visibly affected,
and remarked:
"Jf we had 5000 of our soldiers there
now they would settle that trouble at
Tientsin promptly."
Surgeon General George Miller Stern
berg oejran his career as assistant sur
geon In the t.'nion army in May, 1S61, anJ
served with distinction throughout the
war. He was In the Indian wars, and
came to the Department of California in
1S81, being assigned to Fort Mason. Ho
remained in this city until 1S32.
General Sternberg will be given a re
ception this evening in the Maple Hal!
of the Palace* by Colonel Forward, chief
surgeon of the Department of California.
Invitations have been sent to one hundred
ladies and gentlemen. Refreshments will
be served and dancing will follow.

E. CRAXDEL.L is a dairyman at
4097 Eighteenth street, and George
Hayden is a partner in the YVest
ern Dairy Company. Hayden has
felt aggrieved because Crandell took some
customers from him. and while he was
driving along Devisadero street Saturdav
afternoon with one of his men met Crandell
in his wagon. As Crandell passed Hayden
shied a bottle of milk at him and ordered
his driver to pursue the rival milkman,
who. scenting danger, whipped up his
horses. The pursuit was kept up for sev
eral blocks, Hayden firing milk bottles at
Crandell. and when he drew near enough
he would fire a milk can at him. Crandell
was soon covered with milk and contu
sions. One of the milk bottles struck
Crandell on the nose, and the blood and
milk made a pleasing combination on his
face and shirt front.
Crandell appeared before Judge Mogan
yesterday and swore out a warrant for
Hayden's arrest on the charge of battery.
"My nose and back." said Crandell. "are
still sore from contact with the milk bot
tles thrown by Hayden. I want him pun
ished, as the next time he meets me 1 am
afraid he will subject me to another fusil
lade. I guess some of his customers had
to get alonij without their mlik supply S*;
urday, as the most of it was scattered in
my wagon and en the roadway."

Kay Ewry of New York Breaks His
Own World's Record in the
Standing High
Jump.
-
PARIS, July 16.â Twenty-one champion
ship contests In connection with the ex
position have been decided during the last
three days, and America can boast of
winning sixteen and of securing thirteen
seconds and twelve thirds.
Xlne events took place to-day, In which
the Americans placed six first, six sec
onds and seven thirds to their credit.
They completed the 200 meter hurdle racÂ©
and standing high jump, three standing
jumps, the long jump, the hop, step and
Jump, thÂ£ hammer throwing and the
standing broad jump; and they did it
easily. In fact, the facility with which
the American athletes carried off prizes
finally grew monotonous. Three events
were won by foreigners. One, the tug of
war, was not contested by the Americans.
In the SOO meters .flat race, which was
won by an Englishman, Tysoe, the Amer
icans took second and third. In the re
maining race, the 400 meters steeple
chase, they failed to get a place, the Eng
lishmen taking all three.
Kraenzlein of the University of Penn
sylvania won the first heat in the 200 me
tres hurdle race very easily in 27 seconds.
Choisel, a Frenchman, was second, and
Orton of the University of Pennsylvania
was third. Pritchard, the champion 100
yard runner of India, defeated Tewks
bury of the University of Pennsylvania in
the second heat in 2(J 3-5 seconds. T. B.
McLean of the University of Pennsylva
nia was third.
The final heat was almost a walkover
for Kraenzlein. who finished a yard ahead
of his competitors. The race for place
was vlgorouslv contested, however,
Pritchard again beating Tewksbury, who
finished third. Time, 25 2-5 seconds. Choi,
sel, the Frenchman, also ran.
Rau, a German; Molonev of Chicago
University and Remington of the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania were among those
who ran in the tirst trial heat, and Tau
sin. a Frenchman; Levls of Syracuse and
McLean of the University of Pennsylva
nia contested in the second trial neat.
There were only four starters in the flna>
heat.
The three standing jumps were easily
an American event, the athletes from the
United States quickly outjumping all the
other competitors.
The same can be said of the hop. step
and jump, which followed. Prinstein ot
Syracuse University, Connelly of Boston
and Richard Sheldon of the New York
Athletic Club qualified for the finals and
jump oiT. PrlnstelH won. though Connelly
pushed him hard. The same entries com
peted in these two jumping contests, there
being besides those already mentioned
Jarvls of Pennsylvania, Orton of Prince
ton, McClaln of Michigan, Staff, Swede;
Steffen, German, and Koppan. Greek.
The SOO meters flat race brought six men
to the tape for the final heatâ Cregan or
Princeton. Hall of Brown University,
John B. Ray of Williams. Tysoe. the Kngr
lishman; Speidel. a Hungarian, and l>e
Loge, a Frenchman. There was great in
terest manifested in this event, as it was
expected to be a hard contest. Such
proved to be the case until the stretch,
where Da Loge collapsed, leaving Cregan
and Tysoe to tight It out. Tysoe had the
advantage of the lead, as he made thf
running the entire race. Cregare ran
gamely, but could not overcome the Brit
isher, who finished a yard in advance.
Hall was third, some distance back.
The standing high Jump was a contest
of Americans, they being the only en
tries. Ray Ewry of the New York Ath
letic Club, who holds the record, won;
Baxter of the University of Pennsylvania
got the place from Richard Sheldon of
the New York Athletic Club.
It was then announced that Ewry would
attempt to surpass his own world's record
of 1 meter 63 centimeters. This he did on
the second attempt, clearing 1 meter t>Â»
centimeters. The spectators who had
gathered about the jumping stop cheered
heartily at this, performance, and when,
after a minute's rest, he cleared 1 meter
65 centimeters there was much enthusi
asm shown and the applause was vigor
ous. Â¦

SUPERIOR SKILL
OF AMERICANS
AGAIN SHOWN
An organized gang of confidence men
and bunko steorcrs has beon success? ullv
operating in this city during the last two
months, the headquarters being room 5
. : the Carlton Uous-e. 405 Kearny street.
As yet the jxilice seem to be unable to
cope with me crocks. The latter eeek
their victims in the prominent hotels
tr.rougrhout the city and the proprietors
f â¢ those places have made numerous com-
V -lints to the officers.
LJifl^rent snares are employed to entice
the- unwary to the lair of the thieves. The
latest, however, is the "Klondike gag."
A bogus doctor tigures in one case and
"innocent gmnaea of cards" cost the play
en much for their experience. Many of
the* intended victims have eluded the
crooks and uie hotel proprietors have been
using every endeavor tor the protection
c r their gu^t* 1
About two months ago T. 6. Walton of
Arizona, a guest at the Russ House, was
taKtn u> tne Carlton Ho_us*e. W'nen me
card game was commenced the door of the
roan was locked and Walton wan asked
tu produce his coin. The Arizona man
realized the character of the men he was
dealing with and promptly drew a six-
Ehooter. The thieves allowed him to go
\v!th ins money. Shortly afterward an
othtr guest of the fiiEf hotel wrio had
come to the city to be treated for rheu
matism was "steered against" a bogus
<l..<-t..r. who extorted $4^' trr.m him. YVnen
the patient found he had been victimized
he threatened the doctor with arres=t and
imcceeded in getting back $20 of the
amount lost.
O. A. Baldwin, who stopped for a time
at the Occidental Hotel, was taken to the
K<"arny-Â«m*<et headquarters of the con
fuitnee men three weeks ago and
â¢'cropped" lad. Sunday nigh: Pearl Young,
one of the proprietors of the Ruf? House,
called at the California-street Pclice Sta
tion and reported two more cases. One
was that of \V. F. Epler, whose home is
in Australia. In both the eases the guests
\vÂ«>re accosted by a nan who claimed to
have recently arrived from the Klondike
and who Invited them to view some ?p?ci
mor.s at hi? room?. As in the other
transaction, the men were taken to the
Cmrltoa House, where they met a "colo
nel" and a "judge"' and were invited to
take a hand ta a game r<{ cards. Both
mÂ«n JoÂ«=t a email amount and reported the
matter to the police.
These cases are but a few of the nu

Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
111S Broadway, July 1<5.
Orchardists of Eden Township are much
perturbed over the rejection of a great
deal of fruit offered to the local cannera.
the objection being that the product is not
up to the standard set by the cannery
combine.
There Is a wide difference of opinion be
tween the growers ar.d the canners as to
what "constitutes "standards." Wagon
loads of fruit, peaches and apricots, have
been dumped at the canneries, only to be
turned back to the growers after tests
which it is claimed by the canners showed
the fruit to be undersized. Much fruit
was picked upon the assumption that It
would run twelve to the pound, the con
tract standard, but upon grading at tha
cannery the fruit would not hold out. It
would go from thirteen to fourteen to the
pound and would be rejected. The grow
ers claim that this is Al fruit and should
be accepted.
A large number of growers have not
tried to dry the rejected product, but hare
shipped It to San Kraneisco. where the
prevailing prices brought them from $S to
$12 a ton.
Another grievance of the growers Is the
fact that extra-sized fruit, .running eight
to the pound. Is being paid for by the ean
ners at $20 a ton only. The orcharvlsts
claim that they should receive $23 for this
grade.
The complaints have been so numerous
In the vicinity cÂ£ San Leandro that not
a few growers are deploring the failure of
the organization which was proposed, to
turn all the product over to the associa
tion, -which was formed to handle the
State crops Independently of cannery com
binations.
Claim Advantage Is Being Taken by
the Combine of the Failure
of Orchardists to
Organize.

Was to i/ocate Niter Beds.
J. C. C. Price, veterinary surgeon and
mining prospector, was arrested yester
day on a warrant charging him. with ob
taining money \by false pretenses. The
complaint * was Sworn to by. Attorney
George H.' Perry some weeks ago. Perry
alleges rthat he and some- friends ad
vanced Price various sums of money on
his statement that he had located niter
beds in Inyo County, but it was found
that his representations were not true.
Held in Heavy Bonds.
Joseph Besenco, the Mexican who
stabbed E. J. Becker, bartender in the
Louvre, Eddy and Powell streets, because
Becker refused to srlve him a drink, was
held to answer before the Superior Court
by Judge Mogan yesterday in $5000 bonds.
The 'Judge said It .was the act of a cold
blooded assassin. -, â¢.
HOTEL ARRIVALS.
The Board of Equalization finished its
labors at 1:30 o'clock yesterday afternoon.
The time allowed for filing petitions for
decrease In assessments expired at 12 m.,
but the Supervisors continued the consid
eration of petitions previously filed.
The final session began at 10 o'clock.
Among the Important assessments con
sidered were that of the Spring Valley
Water "Works, whose petition for a re
duction of $2,000,000 was denied, and those
of the Sutter-street Railway Company,
J. L. Whitcomb estate and Isaack Kohn,
all of which were denied.
The Spring Valley Water Works case
had been argued at the previous meeting
and submitted. The company's contention
was that the assessment of $5,&.*5,2?3
would increase its taxes to $34,(KXÂ» more
than the amount allowed by the Supervi
sors In fixing the water rates. This, the
company's representatives claimed, would
be a breach of faith on the part of the
Supervisors In their capacity as a Board
of Equalization.
"The figures of the Â¦water company,"
Supervisor Reed said, "are entirely cor
rect. This assessment does raise its taxes
$43,000 over what we allpwed. But the in
crease la offset by certain other factors
that must be considered. In the first
place, there is an Increase In the receipts
rrom consumers. They admit that tne
Increase amounted to $10u.txw last year
and as much or more is expected this
year. That alone more than offsets the
increase In taxes.
"We ngured thÂ© valuation very liberally
in fixing the water rates. We allowed the
company 5 per cent on a valuation ot
J26,0uO,0w. It should have been placed at
about $20,000,000."
Supervisor Braunhart said that the
wattr company's contention, ir valid,
would mean that If competition were to
cut down the dividends to nothing no
taxes whatever could be collected wltnout
breach of faith.
Supervisor Sanderson said that when
water rau?s were being fixed the com
pany's estimate of operating expenses
nad been cut down $99,uOO, the argument
being made that the natural increase in
receipts from consumers would offset the
cut made. He did not think It was fair
row to offset the increase In taxes against
the same item. Reed did not remember
that the increase in receipts was consid
ered In connection with the cutting down
of the item for operating expenses. The
cut, moreover, was but $65,000.
"Our functions here." said Supervisor
d'Ancona, "are entirely separate from
those we exercise as Supervisors. What
we did then should not control our actions
now in equalizing assessments."
"Then we can be Dr. Jekylls and Mr.
Hydes politically?" queried Mr. Sander
son.
"We acted upon the information before
us," Supervisor McCarthy said, "but now
we should take Into consideration the re
sults of the Assessor's investigations."
Supervisor Sanderson moved that the
application be granted. He and Comte
voted aye and all the others present â
Booth. Boxton, Braunhart, Connor, Cur
tis, D'Ancona, Jennings. McCarthy and
Reedâ voted In the negative. The motion
to deny the application was carried.
The attorney for the J. L. Whitcomb
estate was present to support the appli
cation of the trustees for the cancellation
of an assessment of $3,000,000. except $200.
000 on San Francisco property. He ex
plained that the estate"s wealth was in
vested in bonds held in New York, and
that the heirs lived In Paris, and con
tended that the bonds were not assessable
here.
Assessor Dodge said the trustees resid
ed here and the estate was probated here.
The trouble was. he asserted, that the
estate had escaped payment of taxes on
the bonds for the past ten vears. The
Crocker estate, similarly situated, paid
taxes on its bonds held in New York
without any protest. The board denied
the application.
The Sutter Street Railway Companv
asked a reduction in Its franchise asses3*
ment from $1,350,623 to $709,790. A. K. Ste
vens, secretary of the company, was pres
ent and said that such an assessment
would prevent the company from paying
& 5 per cent dividend. Assessor Dodge
quoted facts and figures In defense of his
assessment. A remark of Secretary Ste
vens to the effect that It was rough on
the company caused Supervisor McCarthy
to reply:
"It was rough on the city when you
tore up Bush street to remove the rails
and did not put It in shape again."
The application was denied, but the ap
plication of the same company for a re
duction of the franchise assessment of
$20,000 on the Sutro Railroad Compan>
to the old nominal assessment of $150 waa
granted. i
The Giant Powder Company's petition
that the assessment of $150,000 'on Us fran
chise be canceled was denied.
F. H. Pitman, secretary of the Judson
Dynamite and Powder Company, was
present on a summons to appear and show
cause why the assessment on the com
pany's franchise should not be raised, it
being placed at a nominal amount. The
Inquiry resulted from a remark by Attor
ney Plllsbury Saturday that the Califor
nia Powder Works had been discriminated
against. From the showing made Asses
sor Dodge said he would strenuously op
pose any raise in the Judson Company's
assessment. No change In the Assessor's
figures was made.
J. J. Rauer presented a statement of
solvent credits. An arbitrary assessment
of $5000 had been levied. He petitioned
for a reduction, and was told to prepare
a statement of his solvent credits. He
did bo and the amount was $5327. The
board promptly raised the assessment to
that amount. Rauer testified that he had
but S9 cents In the bank at noon on the
first Monday. in March.
On the showing made by Major C. L.
Tllden for the Sanitary Reduction Works,
Its assessment was reduced from $60,000 to
$25 000.
J J Smith wanted the assessment of
$37 500 on the bark Abbie Palmer can
celed and W. E. Mighell asked the same
for assessments amounting to more, than
$100 000 on vessels, all of which were regis
tered at Port Townsend. Assessor Dodge
claimed that the permanent registration
of the vessels was here, and said that
City and County Attorney Lane held that
the vessels were taxable here. \The peti
tions were denied.

WHEN I called on Ruef and told
him that I had a power of attor
ney from, John Sullivan, he sat in
his private office axid in the
course of the conversation which followed
he said:
"I want to make a good suggestion to
youâ do as fj Martin Stevens does." I
stated that I was unacquainted with
Stevens' mode of procedure. He replied:
"You are appointed by the court and from
that you will at the outside get a couple
of hundred dollars Your power of attorney
Is all right in its way. but it won't increase
your fee. Now, If Stevens was in your
place he would get, in addition to the
power of attorney, a contract from Sul
livan for a portion of the estate for his
services â say a quarter, a third or a half.
Now, why don't you do the same?"
I thanked him, saying I would.
The next time we talked of the estate I
told him I had a contract for a third.
"Good," said he, "now you will make
something. Will you let me see it the
next time you are in?" I said I would.
Some time afterward I called at his of
fice and submitted the contract now In
.Captain Seymour's possession. He read it
over carefully, handed it over and said,
"It's all right. Now, while I have no
right to demand it," said he, "I think, un
der the existing circumstances, as It was
through me 'that you obtained this ap
pointment, you should give me some
thing out of your share." "I think you
are entitled to it and I am willing to do
the right thing. What do you want?"
said I. "Well, I'll leave it to you." he re
plied. After some more conversation he
suggested one-third of what I should re
ceive. After more talk I promised him
that share.
Ruefs One-Third. i
lie ihen took a sheet of yellow
foolscnp paper nnd with a pencil
wrote: "I pgree to pay Raef one
third of my share In the Sullivan
estnte." At hln reqnent I nlsrned It.
It wan nmliitoil nnd li nrrleil 1>- writ
ten. As he picked It up lie naldi
"This In all the aere'ement I need."
He then opened the right hand drawer
of his desk, the one in which his check
book is kept, and dropped it in. On sev
eral occasions he referred to this agree
ment and more than once I spoke to his
clerk, Keane, about it. He is fully cog
nizant of it.
On Monday when the first article ap
peared in The Call. I was told by Rauer
that he was $261 richer than he thought.
On asking an explanation he said: "Ruef
has telephoned me that there is $2611 com- !
ing to me Instead of $2350. I suppose that
is the third you were to give him." I said:
"Yes, that is right."
I have never accused Rauer of getting
a share of the unlawful division of -the
Sullivan estate. On the contrary I wish
to say that Rauer has acted fairly and
square with Rogers. Ruef and myself;
especially when Ruef declined to allow
Drinkhouse to advance any money to
Dutchey after the decree had been signed,
as he immediately said: "I will put It up.
Come over to my ofHee." This was to
Dutchey and myself in Ruef's office on
the afternoon of May 4, where the four
of us had been closeted from 2:30 until
after 5 o'clock. Dutchey and myself went
with Rauer to hlg office, where he gavÂ«
me a check for J7oO, which was cashed the
next day and appropriated in full by
Dutchey.
Not IKsinterested Vlgilanoe.
While Ruef was showing the greatest
vigilance for the protection of the Public
Administrator he was doing It as well
for his one-third, -and probably would
never have gone over the figures of ex
penses and amounts due and paid out so
many times if that were not the fact.
There has never been a word said or a
thing Intimated by me against the hon
esty and Integrity of the Public Adminis
trator in this matter. I do not claim he
had any Interest In It, but on the con
trary I know Ruef was very particular in
cautioning me not ' to let Drinkhouse or
any one else know of the transaction be
tween us. He says It Is incomprehensible
why I should make the statements that
are attributed to me. Well, I am tired of
being -the dupe and catspaw of men who
promise everything when in danger, . but
not only don't know you but abuse you
when they think they are safely out of
the mire.
In may; statement of yesterday I forgot
to mention one matter in regard to Mr.
Rogers. On last Monday when he tele

hallway; then, when we pressed Chretien,
we were informed that he was sick In
Sacramento, and thereupon Chretien asked
me for, and I gave him, $10, and told him
to have his client there the next day,
which he promised to do. Rogers prom
ised to produce the letter authorizing him
to appear, and the matter was continued
until the next day, which, I believe, was
Ma - V <Â¦ , ,
On the next day I again appeared in
court with my attorney, and Rogers pro
duced, under order of the court, a letter
written by some one from London. Chre
tien produced a telegram from Sacra
mento in which it was stated that his
client, Sullivan, was seriously ill with ty
phoid pneumonia at that place. Upon
Rogers reading his London letter Chretien
called the court's attention to the fact
that the name of the Sullivan that Rog
ers represented did not correspond to the
names of Chretien's clients as they ap
peared on the books of the Hibernia Bank,
in which bank decedent had his acount.
I volunteered with Rogers to go to the
bank and see whether he (Rogers) or
Chretien were right. The court then post
poned the matter until 2 p. m.
Rogers and I went down to the bank
and I saw a Mr. Ryan. Rogers asked
Ryan whether the names that he, Rogers,
had corresponded with the names on the
books of the bank and Ryan said no. As
we were going out of the bank Rogers re
marked that Chretien was doing well out
of the estate and that he, Rogers, ought
to Have something for his fee.
I told him that I would see Chre
tien and ask him what he would do.
I saw Chretien, who told me, as his
clients were anxious to leave the city
and go to Nome, he, Chretien, did not
want any delay in the matter, and
for me to make the best terms pos
sible with Rogers. I saw Rogers
before court met, just before 2
o'clock, and told him that Chretien
had instructed me to make the best
terms possible. Rogers filially agreed
to take six hundred dollars. Rogers
and I then went to the Judge in his
chambers and Rogers informed the
Judge that he was mistaken as to
his heirs and withdrew all opposi
tion. The decree of distribution was
signed that afternoon. Befor the de
cree was signed I told Chretien he
was to get $600. Chretien did not
like this very well, but finally said
he would not stand it all, that Sulli
van would have to share some of it.
After the decree was signed Chretien
instructed mÂ« to take the six hun
dred dollars up to Rogers, which I
did, by leaving it on his desk in his
presence.
Ruef Grew Suspicious.
I then came ! from Rogers' office to
Ruefs office to get back my money that
I had advanced. I met Chretien there with
Ruef and Chretien asked if he could get
his money and Ruef answered, ' No, you
will have to wait sixty days. Chretien
replied "Why I gave you an indemnity
bond." Ruef said, "Well, you did not pay
Rigby's fees and we did not accept it.
Ruef rang up Rigby & RIgby, the attor
neys for the indemnity company, about
the bond. Chretien then turned to me
and r.sked me what I would give for the
estate, .which he said was $2230. After
figuring a, while I offered him $750 In ad
dition to what he had received. He
thought it too much and left for Rigby's
office to see what arrangements he could
make about a â¢ bond so. that he could
draw the money. He came back shortly
and stated that Rigby would give the
bond, but that he wanted the money de
posited with him. (Rigby). My offer was
accepted by Chretien, who said it was the
best he could do.. as his client was going
to Nome the following Monday, the 7th,
and was anxious to have his money.
In answer to my questions Mr. Ruef
told me. that certain receipts were neces
sary to be- acknowledged by Sullivan.
Chretien said that he had a power of at
torney and could do that. But Ruef
said-"No." He wanted Sullivan to do It.
The papers- were prepared and given to
Chretien to have I Sullivan sign and
acknowledge them. Chretien said that
Sullivan was in Sacramento and that he
would go there that night and get him,
but that he must have the $750 to take to
Sullivan. I would not give him the money,
but Instead drew a check for $750, payable
to John Sullivan, which I said he could
cash when he (Chretien) brought me back
the receipts and papers properly signed
and- acknowledged by Sullivan as required
by* RuÂ«f. I gave Chretien $10 for ex
penses to Sacramento to bring- Sullivan
back. I; stopped payment on the check
the next day until Chretien brought me
the papers signed and indorsed by Sulli
van and acknowledged by Sullivan before
a notary public.

ON or about April 2G, 1M0, Chretien
called at my office and stated that
his client and himself wanted to
borrow some money on an estate
then pending in Department 10. I asked
him what estate and he said it was the
"Sullivan estate," giving me the number.
I told him I would have my attorney,
Mr. Perry, look it up, and when I had re
ceived Perry's report I would talk to him
abcut It. He called again, and Perry hav
ing reported that the proceedings as a.p
peared from the papers on file were reg
ular, I then talked business to him. He
wanted $500â that is. $400 for his client.
Sullivan, and $100 for himself. He was
indebted to me at the time in the sum of
$150 40. He stated that the estate would
be distributed about May 3- or May 4, and
that he had in addition to his fee an as
signment of one-third of the estate from
his client. He showed me a general
power of attorney, acknowledged by his
client, as he said, Sullivan, before Sands
Forman, the. notary public. As my deal
ings with Chretien had always been reg
ular I , entertained his proposition and
took an assignment from him for $800
against the estate, signed .by him indi
vidually and as attorney in fact. for his
client. Sullivan. Chretien received from
me $500 in two, checks, a receipt for the
$150 40 that he owed me, and I charged
him a bonus of $150, making up the $S00.
I Immediately notified the Public Admin
istrator and his attorney of. this assign
ment by Chretien.
Matters ran along untllthe evening be
fore the day on which the settlement of
the account and order of distribution was
to come up in the Sullivan estate. At
that time Chretien came to my office and
notified me that Mr. Rogers Intended
the next day to ask for a postponement
of the hearing, so . that . he (Rogers)
might take the testimony of some wit
nesses in England. I- asked Mr. Parry,
my attorney, to be present next day in
Department 10 and oppose such continu
ance, as Mr. Chretien had informed mo
that Rogers' clients were not the right
heirs and that Rogers had no right to ap
pear or authority to appear. The next
day I was present In court with my at
torney when the Sullivan case was called.
Settling the Estate.
The settlement of the administrator's
account came up first. This was settled
by consent of Ruef. Chretien and Rogers.
Then when the matter of distribution
of the estate came up Mr. Rogers asked
the court for a long continuance, In order
to take some depositions/This was op
posed vigorously by Chretien, and Rogers*
authority for acting was demanded.. My
attorney asked for Sullivan to take the
stand. We were told at first he was in the

RAUER BRINGS
ROGERS RIGHT
INTO THE CASE
KUMASSI IS RELIEVED
BY COLONEL WILLCOCKS
FTJMSU, July 17.â Kumassi has been re
lieved by the column under command ot
Colonel Willcocks.
James Taylor Rogers has lived under
a mask of respectability for many years,
and this transaction reveals him to the
community as he is, a disgrace to the
profession of which he is a member and
a menace to the living and the dead
upon whom he preys. One by one the
rascals in this affair are being forced
into the light and to-day the Grand
Rascals Coining From Cover.
When the time for distribution came
Rogers threw himself into the case an-1
threatened that he would have it in
definitely postponed as far as distribu
tion was concerned if he did not re
ceive what he demanded. His first de
mand was for $iooo, but he was finally
persuaded to accept $6oo, which Rauer
supplied and then charged against
Chretien. This money Rauer said he
took to the office of James Taylor Rog
ers before the decree was signed and
placed it upon the" dishonorable, black
mailing attorney's desk. This is the
part that James Taylor Rogers, accord
ing to the testimony of three witnesses,
has played in this outrageous conspiracy
to rob the dead through a Probate
Court in this city.
Rauer swore in his statement to the
chief of detectives that Rogers posi
tively declined to permit the estate to
be distributed unless he received this
money. This remarkable statement.
which makes out of James Taylor Rog
ers a rascally, scheming shark of the
law, is corroborated by the confession
of John M. Chretien and by the testi
mony of another witness who has been
subpenaed and who will appear to-day
to give his testimony before the Grand
Jury.
Rogers Blackmailed the Conspirators.
So thoroughly dishonorable were the
transactions between Rauer and Rog
ers and so perfectly did the money
broker understand the dishonesty of the
greedy attorney that there was subter
fuge ever, in the payment of the black
mail which Rogers had levied upon the
thieving conspirators who were rob
bing the estate of the dead. Rogers
had demanded his share of the booty
from Chretien, who was unable to pay
it, and begged Rauer to assist him out.
Rauer was already deeply involved,
having loaned considerable money to
the schemers in the belief that the heir
was bona fide and that his money would
be returned when the distribution was
made. The money broker was eager
therefore to make terms with Rogers
and get him out of the way.
THE entire shameful conspiracy of
a clique of dishonorable lawyers
and others to rob the estate of
Joseph Sullivan in the court of Judpe
James M. Troutt, as exposed by The
Call in startling detail, will be retold to
day to the Grand Jury. The conspna
tors have lost their bold front and fol
lowing the lead of the confessed scoun
drel. John M. Chretien, they also are
confessing- and are telling what they
know of the scoundrelism of one an
other. One of the most sensational in
cidents of this scandalous affair took
place yesterday afternoon in the office
of Chief of Detectives John Sevmour.
when Jake Rauer, the money broker, to
whom practically all the estate would
have gone had it not been for the time
ly expose of The Call, made a sworn
statement in which he declared that
James Taylor Rogers was one of the
greediest of the conspirators and re
ceived $6oo as his share of the spoils of
what a dead man had left.

Ruef "Was His Friend."
On last Saturday morning ex-Judge C.
A. Low called on me. He informs d me
that he had seen Ruef the night before
and had come to see me at his request.
The Judge said: "Ruef is your friend: he
fully realizes what you have done for him
and he Is grateful and will do everything
In his power to help you. He wants you
to be very careful with whom to talk
and*above all things keep your mouth
shut in the presence of reporters and con
tinue to do as I see you are doingâ don t
talk to them." .
Last Monday night, the day that the
first article appeared in The Call. I left
my house at 8 o'clock in the evening and
after stopping at one or two places called
at T. D. Riordan's office. On entering
there I found Mr. Keane of Mr. Ruef s
office. After shaking hands and passing
a few remarks I went into Mr. Riordan a
private office, where I told him my entire
connection with Ruef and Rogers in the
Sullivan estate. I told him the facts as,
fully set forth in my statement to Cap
tain Seymour yesterday and to-day. I
was with him probably an hour. When
I came out of his room I was surprised
to see Mr. Keane still there. Mr. R'or
dan said he thought Keane was waiting
for me. I asked Keane If I could do any
thing for him. He said "Yes"; that he
had come to serve me with a citation to
appear the next mofning in Judge
Troutfs court. I accepted the citation
and apologized for keeping him waiting '
so long. He remarked that It was of no
consequence and then asked which way I
was going. "Home," I said. "Let s take
a California street car. I have an ap
pointment to-nleht with Drinkhouse and
will ride with you, as I want to speak to
vou " said he. We got on the rear dummy
bf a California street car. We were the
only ones on that end. save the conductor.

He then apaln spoke of the kindly feel

said: "Of course you need not mention
anything: In reference to your agreement
with Ruef, as that would only hurt and
do no one any pood." I promised him.
when he said: "There are only two or
three of us that know of it. and of course
Ruef will not ask you anything aboutit,
so there is no danger of It coming out."

Jury will hear the whole shameful tes
timony, receive the documentary evi
dence which will be placed at its com
mand and probably reach the decision
which will ultimately place some of
these scoundrels out of the sphere in
which they have power to do wrong.
This statement of Rauer naturally has
created a sensation in police circles, as
it is corroborated not only by the con
fession of John M. Chretien but by the
testimony of another witness who will
appear before the Grand Jury this aft
ernoon.
Rauer is particular in reciting every
minute detail in the transactions with
Rogers. When the money was raised to
pay Rogers it is understood that Chre
tien objected strenuousb' in having to
bear the entire burden of the blackmail
which Rogers had levied upon the con
spirators. Chretien insisted that while
Rauer had charged him $6oo Young
Dutchy should have at least paid $ioo.
and this sum the pugilistic blackleg who
is now in Nome paid to Chretien as his
share in the transaction. When The
Call made its sensational expose a week
ago yesterday Rauer saw at oijce that
he had been swindled by a clever clique
of rascals and he set about to discover
some means by which he could recover
a part of the money which he had given
to them.
Rauer Demands His Money.
When on Wednesday|last John M.
Chretien made a complete confession
of the part he had played in the scan
dalous rffair Rauer was convinced that
if he was to regain some of his money
he must do so at once. During the re
cess at noon therefore he sent for Rog
ers. He telephoned to the legal shark's
office and was informed that he was not
there. Rauer's attorney, George H.
Perry, suggested that Rogers might be
at the office of his attorney, Barclay
Henley. A telephone message found
him there, and he was told to go to
Rauer's office at once. He complied
with this demand and entered Rauer's
office through the rear, going into a
room where Perry was with Rauer. The
money broker asked Perry to leave the
room, which he did through folding
doors. When Perry had gone Rauer
demanded of Rogers that he return the
$6oo which he had received, as the
whole affair had been a conspiracy, the
heir an impostor and distribution out
of the question.
Rogers declined to do so, declaring
that if a crisis came his word was as
good as Rauer's and he would denv
that he had ever received the money.
That conversation was overheard and
the person who heard it will so testify
to-day before the Grand Jury. There
seems little doubt therefore that the net
has been drawn around another scoun
drel in this case, who deserves punish
ment equally with the rascal who has
already confessed his guilt.
Chretien Accuses Ruef.
John M. Chretien supplemented his
confession yesterday by declaring what
he alleges to be the part which Abra
ham Ruef plajTd in the affair. Chretien
says in this confession that he was ad
vised by Ruel to secure from the bogus
John Sullivan a contract for one-third
of the estate in emulation of a practice
which Martin Stevens, the friend and
ex-partner of Judge Troutt, has found
profitable. Chretien adds that he se
cured this contract and so informed
Ruef. A-hereupon the latter asked him
for one-third of the share which he was
to receive from Sullivan. This. Chretien
declares, comprehends practically all
that Ruef had to do with the case until
The Call made its timely expose.
Chretien says that on the evening of
the day of the first publication of the
scandal in The Call Ruef sent his clerk.
Keane, to him with a proposition to be
thoroughly on his* guard, to talk to no
one and to watch developments. Keane,
Chretien says, told him that Ruef
would conduct the examination on the
following day and would take very good
care that Chretien was the last witness
called. As a matter of fact Chretien
was the first witness, and his testimony
closed with a confession.
These are the additional and startling
developments which occurred in this
scandalous case in the Probate Court
of Judge Troutt. The outrageous af
fair has excited the indignation of law
yers and laymen alike, and there ap-*
pears to be a disposition on the part of
the authorities to leave nothing undone
to punish the offenders for their crimes.
District Attorney Byington is prepar
ing- the evidence which is beinjr accum
ulated as fast as possible by Chief of
Detectives John Seymour. The Grand
Jury, as alredy indicated, will meet in
special session this afternoon' and every
body in the case will be examined. Ef
forts are being made to locate Charles
Latner, the impostor, who represented
himself ns the heir, and the Federal au
thorities will be asked to apprehend and
bring back to this city from Alaska
Fred Hansted, alias Young Dutchy, an
other of the criminals involved in the
conspiracy.
Can Judge Troutt Explain?
The preliminary examination of John
M. Chretien was to have commenced
yesterday in the Police Court of Judjrs
A. J. Fritz, but owing to the other de
velopments in the case and particularly
to the fact that the Grand Jury intended

had expired. I called on Ruef the "th
day of July at 12 m. and was Informed
by him that the decree had not been re
corded until May 12, and that the sixty
days would not be up until July 12, when I
could get my money. Chretien was pres
ent, as he said, to receive what was com
ing to him out of the estate over and
above the $2230 coming to me. I left,
telling Ruef I would call again July 12. I
never saw Sullivan nor any one who rep
resented himself as Sullivan. And I ha<l
no idea there was anything wrong about
the estate until the newspaper publica
tion a week ago. Chretien further as
sured me that Sullivan was 1 present nt
the taking of the deposition at Ruefs
office and Ruef told mo that he had seen
him a number of times.
Rogers called upon me at my office at
noon on "Wednesday and I told him that
If I was questioned further I would give
all the facts, and advised him to do like
