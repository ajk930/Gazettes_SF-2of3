TIENTSIN (via * Chef u), July 29.- â Despite the, perilous situation in Peking no active move is
being made by the military forces here. This causes a strong feeling" among the citizens. The
foreign forces are occupied with international jealousies. They lack one head to take the di
rection of affairs. Officers are giving garden parties, while ninety miles away their countrymen ar,e
in danger of massacre. They exaggerate the difficulties of the advance to Peking, instead of active
ly overcoming them. v
I believe that a rapid advance after the taking of Tientsin would have found the Chinese
demoralized and ready to surrender. Peking could then have been easily relieved. Time has now
been afforded them for recuperation..
More than twenty thousand men are doing nothing in Tientsin. Officers say that forty thou
sand troops are necessary in order to hold the little line of communication, and that it will be no use
starting unless they can push through. Others say that the great plains on the way to Peking
have been artificially flooded by the Boxers; that the roads are impassable for transportation and
that they must wait for rains for river transportation, a large amount of- which is necessary for the
wounded, who cannot be left behind on account of the barbarous character of the enemy.
Two views are held here about the recent news of Viceroy Yuan Shi Kai respecting the
9 safety of the Ministers in Peking. The first is this: The fact that Yuan said "My Emperor has is
- sued a decree that the Ministers are safe" indicates that the Chinese Government is re-established
in Peking and that Kwang Hsu is again in power This means the rapid extinction of the war
party. The Ministers now 'held there will buy cheap peace from the powers. The second view is that
if the Ministers are safe under the protection of the Chinese Government theo first act of the latter
would be to forward the Ministers' messages, instead of vicarious information about their safety.'
Recent code dispatches which come undated xontradict Chinese reports regarding the pro
tection given. These messages are merely means to hoodwink foreigners into inaction while Pek
ing is being evacuated and all the treasure removed.
A curious question is how Yuan Shi Kai, aÂ»rebel, who has refused to obey the order to
take his troops to Peking, can have constant communication with the capital. - -

CHEFU, July 2S-â The Chinese shelled
passing trains on the Newchwang-Port
Arthur line Thursday morning, twenty
miles below Newchwang. A Russian ofll
cer sent to make inquiries never returned.
After ' waiting a considerable time the
Russians bombarded and razed the fort?
and: then proceeding to 'Newchwang in
quired for the soldiers who had run away.
CHINESE SHELLED THE
PASSING RAILROAD TRAINS
/ It turns out that the soldiers were -i
puard of the Taotal of Newchwang. who
were protecting the settlements. There
fore the attack was a mistake. The Chi
nese brought their dead to the yamen of
the Taotal. and on complaining were com
pensated by beins paid 100 taels for the
dead and 40 tacls for the wounded.
Much bitter feeling prevails there. Thre
hundred natives immediately fled am!
boarded the Benclutha and have arrived
at Chefu.
They were Informed that they were in
camp three miles from Newchwang. On
arriving there they demanded the evacu
ation of the place. The Chinese refuseu.
ana the Russians attacking, killed six
and wounded twelve. They themselves
had six men wounded.
WASHINGTON', July 31.-Doubt has given way to a feeling akin to cer
tainty that the legationers at Peking and the gallant marines who man
aged to reach the Chinese capital just in the nick of time were not only
alive on July 22 but In all probability are still alive ami likely to remain
so until they are released from their state of siege. The officials here feel cer
tain that the attack by the Chinese on the legations will not be renewed. They
are convinced that the counsels of the Viceroys In the great southern and cen
tral provinces and the advice of LI Hung Chang have had effect, and that who
ever is still In power in Peking, whether Emperor, Empress. Shine. Tuan or
Tung, now have been made to see the necessity for the preservation of the lega
tions. The officials here, while anxious that the movement on Peking begin at
once, do not attach credence to the' rumor mentioned by General Chaffee that
the forward march was to begin to-day. There are two reasons for their in
credulity. In the first place. Chaffee's force, his splendid cavalry and his bat
talion of artillery, are exactly what are needed to strengthen a weak spot In
the international column. In the second place (and Information on this point
comes through' European channels), some of the foreign commanders are still
of the opinion that they cannot begin the campaign before the last week In Au
gust at the earliest. The United States Government has not acceded to thlÂ»
view and is relaxing no effort to bring about a change of plans on this point
But our representations . have been met by the almost unanswerable arerument
that the decision of this Important question properly should be, left to the mili
tary commanders on the spot, who must bear the responsibility for the outcome
of the expedition.
A rather startling proposition was advanced to-day which. If adopted, might
put at once to test the Chinese profession that the Boxers, and not the Chinese
Government, are responsible for what has happened in Peking. This was to the
effect that the Chinese Government should be Informed that the international
force was prepared to take the Government at Us word and to join forces with
it in crushing out the Insurrection. The kernel of just such a proposition is to
be found in the last condition laid down by the President In his reply to tho
appeal of the Emperor. Kwang Hsu. and there may be a development In that di
rection speedily. Secretary Root says that nothing has been received from China
either officially or unofficially, which necessitates any change In the Instruction^
given Major General Chaffee.
If there Is any advance on Peking. It is presumed that such of the United
States forces as are now ready will participate In the movement. If dispatches
are received at Tientsin from Minister Conger or others in tne legation at Pe
king which change the existing conditions. Major General Chaffee will act In
accordance with ruch Information. The Secretary says General Chaffee has full
powers and has been Intrusted" with the command of the United States forces
because of the confidence the Government has In his ability to meet any situa
tion that may arise.
It Is evident from the dispatches received from General Chaffee that only a
portion of his force can be utilized If an immediate advance is made. It Is not
believed that all of the equipments of the last expedition sent from Manila have
been landed, and It is of course apparent that thÂ© horses and most of the equip
ment of the Sixth Cavalry are still at sea. The Ninth Infantry and the two bat
talions of the Fourteenth Infantry, together with the marines, are the only
troops of the United States actually available on Chinese service at this time.
All of the American Forces Not Yet Ready
for the Advance on Peking, but This Is
a Matter Left to General Chaffee's
Discretion.
/^NALL BUREAU, WELLINGTON HOTEL, WASH-
July 31. â China's rulers are believed to have
awakened to a realization of the* dangers in which they
have become involved through their treatment of the Ministers
in Peking. Their whole object now seems to be to prevent, if
possible, the advance of the international forces, and it is not
believed here that there is any immediate danger of the Minis
ters and those under their protection being maltreated. This,
however, is all conjecture built upon the brief messages that
have come from the legations.
The report from private sources in Peking that China offi
cially declared Avar on June 20 is not credited by the administra
tion for the reason that no mention of such action is made in any
of the reports from the legations. It is thought to be quite
{ probable, however, that Chinese officials construed the attack on
the Taku forts by all the powers except the United States as the
practical beginning of war, and that this may account in some
measure for the subsequent events in Peking.
Some comment has been caused by the delay in the trans
mission of the message which Major Waller of the Marine
Corps received from Minister Conger. According to private
messages which have been made public Conger's message en me
in a package delivered to Major Waller, presumably by some
messenger that he succeeded in getting into Peking and out
again.
The only explanation that can be made is that Major Wal
:-ler's dispatch has beeiwlelayed by red tape from being transmit
ted through the regular official channels to Rear Admiral
Remey to be forwarded by him to Washington.
The Ministers apparently see no danger to themselves and
to' the women and children under their protection in aggressive
action by the powers. All their messages urge early relief, and
they probably have full confidence in the ability of the little band
of marines who so gallantly resisted the attacks of the Chinese
for a month to keep up the fight long enough to enable the re
lieving column to reach Peking.. For these reasons it is not be
lieved that if the Chinese open up telegraphic communication
with the Ministers any advice received from them will change
the determination of the powers to march on Peking and dictate
a permanent settlement of the Chinese question with that city
under their gun's.

LONDON, August 1.â The Daily Mail publishes the following
from its special correspondent:
SUANG HAI, July 31.â A telegram from Tientsin
states that a courier has just arrived there bringing advices from
Peking up to July 21. Messages from the British, German, Japa
nese and American Ministers were brought, besides private let
ters. In substance these messages contain the following infor
mation:
The Chinese declared a truce on July 16 and stopped firing
on the legations. The defenders have very little ammunition, and
if the shelling should be resumed they will not be able to hold out
long. Europeans hoped for speedy relief when they heard of the
Tientsin victory.
The American Minister states that his family are all safe
and well. Sir Robert Hart notifies Commissioner Drew that Bre
don of the Customs staff and his family are well.
WASHINGTON, July 31.â The War Department this
afternoon received two cablegrams from China. The first
reads:
"CHEFU (undated). â Corbin, Washington: Tientsin, July
27. â Message just received from Conger says since 16th by
agreement no firing. Have provisions several weeks; little am
munition. All safe, well.
'I (Daggett) report allied forces soon advance. " Practically
no looting by Americans; no unnecessary killing. India arrived
26th. Order McCann, Sladen, both Aliens, Mitchell, Brice join
regiment here. DAGGETT."
The second reads:
"CHEFU. â Corbin, Washington: Tientsin, July 30. â
Flintshire arrived 27th. Two hundred and fifty-seven Ninth In
fantry sick, two doctors, one hundred Hospital Corps men,
twenty signal men needed. Unavoidable delay unloading trans
ports. Foreign troops arriving. DAGGETT."
Adjutant General Corbin to-day received a dispatch from
Lieutenant Colonel Coolidge, commanding the Ninth Infantry
at Tientsin. It came by way of Chefu, and is as follows:
"TIENTSIN, July 2*7.â Following letter of Lieutenant
Colonel Shiba, military attache at the legation of Peking, dated
July 22, arrived at Tientsin on July 25, at 9 o'clock in the even
ing:
" 'PEKING, July 22, evening. â We are all awaiting impa
tiently arrival of reinforcing arm}-. When are you coming? All
legations have been blockaded since the 13th of last month,
and since the 20th we have been attacked continually night and
day by the Chinese soldiers from more than ten encampments.
By supreme efforts we are still defending. We are daily wait
ing with the greatest anxiety the arrival of reinforcing army, and
if you can't reach here in less than a week's time it is probable
that we will be unable to hold out any longer. The Emperor and
Empress Dowager appear to be still at Peking. Were our
reinforcements to arrive it is very probable that thew would flee
to Wan Shoshan. Killed ami wounded up to date â Eight killed,
one a captain of infantry and an Embassador's attache; seven
seriously wounded, the first secretary. of legation being one of
twenty slightly wounded. The number of Europeans killed is
sixty in all. - COOLIDGE.' "
ROME, July 31.â The commander of the Italian cruiser
Elbe at Tientsin received the following telegram to-day from
the Japanese military attache at Peking, dated July 22:
"The legations are eagerly awaiting relief. Cannot hold
out long. Sixty Europeans killed."
SUMMARY OF THE LATEST
NEWS FROM CHINA.
"AH safe and well."
So runs the report from, United States Minister Conger, which was
sent off from Peking presumably on July 21. .The message, in view of Sir
Claude Macdonald's and other reports of casualties among the besieged,
can refer only to. th2 Americans besieged in Peking, and may refer merely
to the embassy staff and Minister's family. .
An urgent appeal for relief comes from the Japanese legation in Pe
king.; This message, dated July 23, says that the defense cannot .'be. main
tained-for longer. -than a week. It is difficult to understand the Japanese
statement, which indicates a continuance or active hostilities, except on the
assumption that the Japanese legation was not comprised in the armis
tice which Sir Claude Macdonald said began on July 16.
General Gaselee, British commander at the mouth of the Peiho, noti
fied his Government that he would advance on Peking without delay, while
Genera! Chaffee on his side has instructions to move forward with ail pos
sible speed. * Â¦Â¦{ .'; -..-/
It is believed in London that the advance for the relief of Peking has
probably begun. Advices from Tientsiri report scouting in the, direction oT
the capital,: doubtless preliminary to a general movement of the allied
forces. That the movement for the relief of Peking would have been begun
already had the allied troops: been ;' under. one supreme head is the opinion
prevailing at Tientsin, as reflected in dispatches from: The Call's special
correspondent there, Â«Jqhn F. v Bass. f â /

SALISBURY DENOUNCES
ACTS OF ANARCHISTS
ROME. July 31.â The Trlbuna says the I
assassination of King Humbert Is be- j
lieved to be the result of a plot. A non- '
militant anarchist recently declared, so
the Tribuna asserts, that a meeting had
been held in Parts at which lots were
drawn and several persons were selected
to kill the King.
.Besides Bressi, five persons have been
taken Into custody at Monza.
In the absence of the new King, the
Ministry has Issued in his name, a mani
festo to the nation, as follows:
"King Victor Emmanuel III, In ascend
ing the throne, has to perform the painful
duty of announcing to the country the
awful calamity which has violently cut
short the valuable life of King Humbert.
The nation, wounded In Its sincere affec
tion for the august dead, and In a sincere
feeling of devotion and adhesion to the
dynasty, while execrating the cruel crime,
will be plunged Into profound grief for
the venerated memory of a good, brave

people and the worthy perpetuator of tha
traditions of the House of Savoy, b/
rallying with unshakable loyalty around
his august successor. Italians will prove
by their deeds that their institutions do

CHINESE ORDERED TO
EXTERMINATE RUSSIANS
LOXDOX, July 31.â A special dispatch,
from Tientsin to-day says: . . - ; .
"A Peking dispatch dated July 21 states
that the first outside news reached there
July IS. The failure of the relief expedi
tion made the siege far more perilous.
On June 19 the Tsung 11 Yamen broke off
relations. On June 20 China declared war.
Baron von Keteller and Francis James,
an English professor, were murdered.
Over 400 non-combatants occupied thÂ«
British legation.
"I understand converts are holding the
north -cathedral. A thousand refugees oc
cupied the palace of^Prlnce Lu. A truce
began July 17, after twenty-six days of
fierce assault. .One night the shelling was
uninterrupted for six hours. Four at
tempts were made to fire the British lega
tion. Two attacks resulted in the ruin of
the Han Lin College (the Chinese national
college). The cowardice of the Chinese
prevented a successful rushing. The total
killed or dead is: Germans, 10; Japanese,
10; French. 11; British. 5; Russians, 4;
Americans, 7;. Italians. 7: converts. 9.
Total wounded, 9S. The correspondents
Morrison. Reid and Tementy are ill.
"At least 2000 Chinese have been killed.
The Americans occupy a strong position
on the city wall. Provisions are still suf
ficient. The hospital arrangements are
excellent. Everybody is much exhausted
by continuous work.
"Imperial edicts have commended the
Boxers and ordered missionaries to leave
the interior and commanded all Viceroys
to help Peking; but an edict dated July
18 enjoins protection and promises com
pensation. The report that a large relief
force was coming produced this change.
Foreign Governments should beware of
being hoodwinked."
PREPARING FOR AN
IMMEDIATE ADVANCE
TWO THOUSAND MONGOLS
KILLED IN PEKING FIGHT
LONDON. Aug. 1. 4 a. m.-A sensa- I
ticnal Shanghai correspondent still
hints that the Chinese are Juggling .
with dctcs, but In the face of the
constantly accumulating evidence ;
that the Ministers were safe on July 22 <
and despite the omission from all the dis- j
patches of anxiously desired Information
regarding the real situation, political and '
otherwise, at Peking there are very few [
In London who do not believe the dis- !
patches genuine and reliable. (
The allies now confront a most difficult j
and dangerous problem.' Without doubt j
the Ministers are held by the Chinese as-.
hostages, and the outcome of the advance j
on Peking. wh!ch in all probability has j
nlrcady begun, will be awaited with in
tense anxiety.
To-day's dispatches show that the allies. |
notably the Japanese, have been pushing j
their preparations with feverish haste, or- !
ganizing a service of pack cars, trains and i
junks. It is reported from Berlin that j
Lieutenant General von Lesscl, command- j
in? the German forces in China, whom i
Emperor Wiliiam has just promoted to j
the rank of poneral commanding an army j
corps, hns been selected as commander in ,
chief of the allied forces.
The Chinese are strongly intrenched at
Vans Tfiin, from which position, how- j
over, it Is believed they can be ejected j
v.ithout great .difficulty. The danger is i
that if defeated there the Chinese will re- j
tire on Peking and put the remainder of j
the Europeans to death. j
It is also possible that the advance of
the allies will be the signal for the Chi- j
nose authorities to compel all foreigners
to quit the capital, in which event they
might become the prey of the fanatical
Boxers.
The feeling of the newspapers here Is
that nothing whatever should delay the j
advance and that no negotiations of any j
kind should be countenanced until the al- !
li*>d troops reach Peking and assure them- J
selves regarding the fate of the foreign
ers. "-^ **.â¢Â¦"''".â¢Â¦..Â¦' '

Th<Â» Tr.kio correspondent of the Daily
Trl^crrnjih. wirinc yesterday, says:
Important additional confirmation of the
safety of the legations was received in
London last evening by Duncan Campbell,
representative In Europe of the Chinese
customs service, from the Commissioner
of Customs at Chefu, in the shape of a
Peking dispatch, not dated, but believed
to have been written en July 21, signed
by both Sir Robert Hart. Inspector Gen
eral of Customs, and Robert Bredon, dep
uty inspector general, to the following ef
fect: "Slaff and family still safe."
This has been confirmed by the Com
missioner of Customs in Shanghai, who
telegraphed last evening: "Authentic. In
spector General safe 22d."
At Berlin Hope Runs High.
BERLIN. July 31.â Hope regarding the
security of the foreigners in Peking now
runs high in Berlin. The German Fore'gn
Office no longer doubts the reports from
various quarters that the Ministers, with
the exception of Baron von Ketteler. are
alive. The papers take the same view,
and urge that there should be no -delay
in the kdvance upon Peking. The Foreign
Office is deeply mortified at the failure to
agree upon a commander In chief- of the
silled forces. A high official said to-day:
"The civilized world will look on with
astonishment if the rescue of the mem
bers of the legations Is delayed, or per
haps frustrated, by such a trifling mat
ter. Germany is ready to march her
troops under any commander acceptable
to the powers." ;
The Munich Allgemeine Zeitung prints
a "^Washington special claiming that the
I'nited States Government is endeavoring
to enforce the appointment of Major Gen
oral ChafTee as commander in chief, but
that Germany end Japan .oppese. /
The Associated Press is authorized to
say that, so far ps Germany is concerned;
this statement is absolutely untrue. /The
Foreign Office confirms the report that
the advance to Peking has been postponed
by the admirals for military and climatic
reasons. ; .â¢..A-
The Chinese Minister, Lu Hal Huah; re.r
ceived to-day a dispatch purporting, to
come from the Peking Government saying
that the foreign legations would be sent
to Tientsin whenever the preparations for
their safe escort were completed and open
hostilities ceased. Meanwhile permission
will be given them to communicate freely
with their Governments.
This dispatch was immediately trans
mitted to the German Foreign Office.
Communication between Chefu and
Shanghai has been re-established, a'nd a
dispatch; from Chefu. dated July 29. con

tured the forts at Niuchwang on July 26.

KwatiR H?u is reported to have sent a
prrond djpjiatch to Emperor Nicholas ad
mitting that a state of war existed at
Tientsin, but that the Russians are fully
protected at op^-n ports. Tho Chinese^
Kmpcror adds, that .the disturbance? in
Manchuria were caused by a rel>ellious
general in Amur, that he ha? instructed
the Chinese generals to refrain from hos
tilities, snd that he desires the Czar to re
ciprocate hi? action."
The Shanghai correspondent of the
Times pays:
"The general aspect of the situation
confirms the opinion that the Manchu
purty, fearing the effect of further violent
monsures. rely on LI Hung Chang's nego
tiations to prevail upon the powers to
forego vengeance in return for the release
of the survivors."
It is reported from an unofficial but us
ually reliable source that the Chinese
Minister at St. Petersburg wired to Li
Hung Chang intimating the possibility of
obtaining favorable terms of settlement
from Russia if China would adopt a con
ciliatory attitude and compel a cessation
of the attacks on the legations. There
upon, according to this Informant, Li
Hung Chans memorialized the throne,
representing that he was ill and unable to
come to Peking, but urging that every
rndravnr tie made to send the Ministers to
Tientsin and to Insure the safety of for
eigners and missionaries.

Caselee and staff, togejther with. large for

Dangers of an Advance.
A member of the Chinese legation gave
an extended interview to the Associated
Press, in the course of which he said:
"I am exceedingly glad that your official
dispatches to-day have borne out our re
peated assurances, which I knew from tne
boginninK wero sincerely meant. I knew
that while the Chinese Emperor could
avoid making a statement of facts such
facts as he 'stated and states must bo
true.
"I hope that the recommendation mace
hy LI Hung Chang that the Ministers
Fhould either be sent to Tientsin or be
placed In telegraphic communication with
their Governments will obtain. I am a
great friend of Sir Robert Hart and I
knew he was still alive, but I wanted to
convince his friends in this country and
I tried hard to get a. cipher telegram
from him. At last Sheng told me the
legations were surrounded and It was im
possible to get in or out without per
mission from the throne. I have applied
to the throne and hope to get permission
in a few days. Consequently you may
now hope to hear direct from the Min
isters.
"It- must be borne In mind that besides
th^ Boxers there is a large force of ir
regular troops in Peking, neither regulars
nor rebels.' but very dangerous to the im
perial Government. Therefore. I would
advise the allied forces not to proceed
without pour parlers with certain high
officials who are acquainted with things.
"I see talk of vengeance upon the Chi
nese. If you could secure those who are
actually responsible for the Boxer move
ment I would Bay nothing, but is it pos
sible for the allies to make the selection?
"LA Hung Chang's statement that the
lives . of the Ministers would be en
dangered by such an advance Is not a
piece of diplomacy, but a serious predic
tion for the consequences of such an ac
tion. General Tung Fuh Slang Is known
to be anti-foreign In his sentiments, but
we cannot dispense with hSs services, and,
having a large number of soldiers under
h!m, he might order a European massa
cre, which- the Emperor and. Empress
would be unable to prevent- â¢
"My object now Is to advise the allies
not. to do any act of vengeance, but to
restore peace and to secure guarantees
for the future. This can be bÂ«Â»st done by
co-operating with IA Hung Chang. If you
push on to Peking:! believe you* whl pro
voke a general rising throughout the. em
pire.' the result of which will be the de
struction\ - of ,- : the "-i lives i and . property . of
foreigners"' everywhere,'* ! " r

HUMBERT'S DEATH ON RECORD.
"The assassination of King Humbert i3
one of those atrocious crimes against tha
heads of government whjch do not seem
to diminish in frequency as governments
grow milder. King Humbert I knew well
and was greatly attached to him. During
my stay in Rome I was assigned three or
four private interviews a year, of about
an hour each, at which only hia Majesty
and I were present, and outside of this I
met him at court functions probably six
or eight times more each year. At all
these latter occasions he never failed to
seek me out for five or ten minutes* con
versation, that being his custom with
each of the Embassadors who might ba
present. He was greatly interested in th*
United States of America, and partlcu- \
larly in our wonderful material progress. I
"At our last interview he said: 'You will '
lead the worldâ you are leading us now
materially. 1 He also said: 'We old nations
that are compelled to keep up immense
armies to protect ourselves against each,
other are very severely handicapped.' Ho

DRAPER'S PRAISE OF
BRAVE KING HUMBERT
NEW YORK. July 31.â A representative
of the Italian consulate went to Hobokon
to-day to see the woman who says she la
t,he wife of Bressi. the assassin of Kir.s
Humbert. The object of the visit was to
obtain information concerning the man
to assist the Italian authorities in pros
ecuting the murderer.
Mrs. Bressii .whose maiden name wa3
Jennie â¢. O'Neill, lived in Chicago before
coming to Hoboken. where she met Bres
si. Mrs. Breasl Was closely questioned by"
the representative of the Italian consul-,,
ate, and, she told him the same story re
garding her husband that she had already
told to the reporters. The police searched
the house, but found no evidence to show
: that either the woman or her husband
was connected with a plot for the assas
sination of King Humbert.
It is stated that Mrs. Bressi will be kept
under surveillance. The Consul General
in this -city is to communicate with the
Hoboken police In case the woman is
needed by the Italian authorities as a
witness.

the police are now seeking. The pistol
the assassin used was a new and superior
weapon marked 'Massachusetts."
The police of Milan searched the house
of a man. named Ranella. and It is re
ported, found an important paper show
ing that Bressi had relations with per
sons In the United States and communi
cations had passed between him and
them, in connection with the crime.
BresM ami another Tuscan frequented the
cafes in Milan, where they were over
heard discussing a bis Wcheaie that would
astonish the world.
Everything goes to show that the rrlmft
was Ions premeditate?] and the police are
now being charged with want of fore

fete were withdrawn prior to his depart

scuffle occurred, probably prearrange? .
to distract the attention of the carbineers.
The King was so pleased with his wel

More Than One Anarchist Concerned In

was the result of a plot conceived and perfected within a few miles of New

The Premier paid a glowing tribute to the character of King Humbert,
who. he paid, had unflagglngly worked for the benefit of his country and
people. The assassination of such a man could not be considered private
revenge. It was nothing but that morbid thirst for notoriety which is the
plague and curse of modern civilization, which had time and again led men
to the commission of foulest Crimea and which threatened the very exist
ence of society if it could not be arrested. He did not propose to speak of
remedies for such a state of things, but he had, never hesitated to express
his own views in that respect. Modern society had erred on the side of

WASHINGTON. July Sl.-None of the
protests reported to have been made in
Alaska against the definition of the pro
visional boundary line have reached
Washington yet, and the impression pre
vails m the State Department that the
agitation on that subject Is based upon a
lack of knowledge of the exact nature of
the agreement effected between the
United States and Great Britain, by which
a. most difficult and dangerous subject was
removed from the current negotiations
between the two countries. It is pointed
out by State Department officials that

Every American rriiner whose claim lies
on the wrong eide of the boundary line
now being drawn Is, according to the of
ficial view here, holding his claim by
quite as sound a tenure as he enjoyed be
fore the provisional treaty was made. He
has neither lost nor gained In strength of
title by this arrangement: so he certainly
has no cause for complaint as he would
have were the boundary line now being
drawn a permanent - one. The officials
here, however, are fully prepared to de
fend the temporary boundary, pointing
out that so far from having ceded to
Great Britain an inch of territory, Great
Britain temporarily yielded. to the United
States fully nineteen-twentieths of the
territory In dispute and suffered her ship

THE DEAD DUKE, THE DECLARED HEIR AND THE "NATIVE"
CLAIMANT.
Coburg law, passed in 1S9S, hereditary
Prince Ernest von Hohenlohe Langen
berg. son-in-law of the late Duke, be
comea the regent.
The German press again discusses the
undesirability of allowing a German sov
ereign state to become an English heir
loom, passing from hand to hand. The
Xatlonal Zeltung concludes its article on
the subject by telling the young Duke
that It will depend on him to dissipate all
objections rmde inside and outride of the
thitchy to- the succession going to a
Prince of foreign Wrth and education. -
It Is rumored here in political circles
that the death of Dukf> Alfred was due
to Intemperance, it being town talk in
Coburg that he was habitually carried to
his bed at night sodden with liquor.
H. R. H. Prince Alfred Ernest William
Alexander Albert, late Duke of Saxony
and of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and first
Duke of Edinburgh, was the second son
of hÂ« Majesty. Queen Victoria and the
late Prince Consort, who was the second
Bon of Ernest I. Duke of Saxe-Coburg.
Prince Alfred Ernest was born at Wind-
Bor, August 6. 1S44. He entered the naval
service of Great Britain as a cadet in 1S58,
and passed through all the grades to that
of vice admiral, to which he was appoint-
at Clarence House. As a foreign sover
eign he ceased to be a Privy Councilor of
Great Britain, and relinquished the annu
ity of Â£15,000 granted him In 1866, though
retaining that of Â£10,000 granted in 1873.
On the death of his only son, Prince
Alfred, last year it was announced June
30, 1899, that H. R. H. Charles Edward,
the young Duke of Albany, born July
19, lfcS4, was the heir presumptive, the
Duke of Connaught and his son renounc
ing their rights in favor of their nephew
and cousin. This arrangement having
been accepted by the Coburg Diet
the question of the succession was con
sidered settled. It is well understood,
however, that there is a hrarty desire
throughout Germany from . the
Kaiser down to have a "native"
ruler on the throne of Saxe-Coburg, and
the question of "buying up"*the English
claimants has been widely discussed. If
this is done Prince Leopold of Saxe-Co
burg, a promising officer of the famous
Austrian Hussars., will be the man. He is
the only son of Prince Philip, head of the
"native" branch of the family and broth
er-in-law of the Kaiserin's only brother,
lie is related to the house of Hapsburg
and also to that of Orleans. Prince Leo
pold is a thorough Teuton, by birth, na
ture and education. He was born at
Schloss Szent, Central Hungary, and at
tained his majority July 19, 1899.
L iisire of the Duchess and other members
t : the family who were aware of the na
ture of the disease, the Duke took up
his residence at Rosenau, His Royal
Highness was unaware of the real Btate
of his health and hoped he would recover
until Friday last, when his condition be
came such as to preclude hope. Saturday
and Sunday he suffered such violent at
tacks of suffocation that arrangements
â¢were made for performing the operation
of tracheotomy. Finally the Duke died
Â¦without, having suffered severe pain. Dur
ing the minority of h's heir, the Duke of
Albany, the government of the duchy will
l>e conducted by the hereditary- prince of
Hohcnlohe-Latigenberg. the guardian of
the young- Emke.
LONDON, July 3Lâ The rewe of the
tlr-ath of the Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.
second son of Queen Victoria, has created
a. sensation in London, as It was totally
unexpected. There were many callers at
Clarence and Marlborough houses and the
Lord Chamberlain's office. Flage were
liiUf-masted at the Carleton. Re-form,
gports and other West End clubs. The
<jueen was deeply affected and the Prince
of Walts canceled the arrangements for
attending Goodwood to-day, where hiÂ»
horse. Lucknow. was the favorite in thÂ©
race for the Stewards' Cup.
At Windsor there were many signs of
mourning, the bells of the curfew tower
Â«jf St. George's Chapel being tolled. It Is
Ftated that the body of the late Duke
will be embalmed and brought to England
for interment and that it will lie in state
at Windsor.
The Duke's successor, the Duke of Al
bany, arrived in London this morning.
The Iyord Mayor of London sent a met-
Mjreof condolence to the Queen on behalf
1 'Â¦ the citizens of London, expressing the
y^. pe that the sympathy of the nation
would prove a solace and comfort in her
r>*>rravemer.t. Numerous public and semi
pub'lc functions have been abandoned and
the court and society -win be immediately
ordered Into mourning-.
The faneral of the late Duke will be held

NEW* YORK. July 31.â John Clark Ridpath. the historian, died in the Pres
byterian Hospital at 5:30 o'clock thi3 evening from a complication of
diseases. He had been a patient in the hospital since April 26. At the
time of the historian's death his wife and son, S. E. Ridpath. were at hla
bedside. The body was later removed from the hospital.
John Clark Ridpath was born in Putnam County, Indiana, April 25, 1S40. On
his father's side he was descended from the Rldpaths of Berwick-on-the-Tweed,
and on his mother's, from Governor Samuel Matthews of Virginia. H'3 parents
emigrated from Montgomery County, Virginia, quite early and were very poor,
but the boy's quickness and diligence overcame all obstacles. He attended the
common schools, and from his twelfth co his sixteenth year studied by himself
works on natural philosophy, astronomy, chemistry and the outlines of history.
At 17 he was teaching- and .also serving as clerk, and later entered Aabury
(now De Pauw) University, where he graduated in 1S63, covering a slx-;*ear
course in four years.
He was made principal of Mornton Academy in 1SC1; Superintendent of Schools
in 1SC6, and in 1S69 was called to the chair of English literature at Asbury. h!Â»
alma mater, which he exchanged in 1871 for that of belles lettres. In 1ST!) he was
elected vice president of the university and was mainly the instrument of se
curing the splendid endowment therefor from W. C. De Pauw, the multi-million
aire of New Albany, Indiana.
While carrying on the work of his department Mr. Ttldpath became the author
of a number of books, the earliest being his "Academic History of the United
States" (1S74), which met with much success, though admittedly of strong sec
tional bias. His "Popular History" (1S77) reached a sale of X0.009, copies and was
translated into German. Xest came his "Inductive Grammar" (1S78). a mono
graph on Alexander Hamilton (1SS0), "Life and "Work of GarrielcT' (1S81> ami a
monograph on the "Trial of Guiteau" (1FS2). His "Cyclopedia of Universal His
tory," published in three volumes (1SS0-S5). to which a fourth was later added,
was very successful, though subjected to much criticism. His later works were
"Beyond the Sierras" (1SSS). "Great Raws of Mankind" (1S31) and "Life of Co'.um
bus." In 18*0 he became one of the editors of the "People's Cyclopedia." an.l
more recently was connected with the Cosmopolitan. Dr. Ridpath received his de
gree of LL.D. . from Syracuse University in KS0. In KG he married Hannah C
Smythe, by whom he had one son and three daughters, all of whom are said to
inherit a lafg-i "measure of their father's. talent3.

with a towel, but was caught before he
had seriously injured himself and was
bundled into the patrol wagon. A panic
ensued in these rooms when the police
appeared and several persons were tram
pled uÂ»!on in thp mad rush to escape.
Chief of Police Klpley said that to-day's
action by the police was the beginning of
a series of raids which would continue
until every alleged bucket shop in Chi

the police during the raid, which was so
perfectly planned that hardly a person,
in all the rooms raided succeeded in es

Glenn County has lost a road dv not
complying with the law which relates to
the condemnation of property for public
uses. Several years ago the Supervisors
decided to open a new road through tha
lands of Mary E. Johnston and others.
The land was examined and the board de
cided that $1010 was fair damages, which
the land owners refused to accept. Con
demnation proceedings were begun In the
Superior Court and the court awarded the
amount stated. That year there was nri
money, in the treasury Tor the payment o'
the damages. The following year an ar*
propriation was made and an executlra
was granted. From this order the laifl
owners appealed to the Supreme Court,
which yesterday reversed the order a la
judgment of the Glenn County Court ur*n
the ground that the code provides that he
payment, for land condemned must jb*Â»
made or tendered within thirty days ajter
final judgment. .; /

The occasion of his lecture will take on
also the nature of a welcome home to this
popular priest.
The price of tickets will be 50 cents and
25 cents extra for reserved Beats. Tickets
are now on sale at Gallagher Brothers, 18
and 20 McAllister street, and, of course,
they can be secured at the Temple on the
evening of the lecture, August 8.
Father McQuaide is a most keen ob
server and an eloquent speaker and his
lecture will be most interesting. While
in the East on his way home he spoke a
number of times on different points In
connection with these Islands. It will be
remembered It was he who controverted
Bishop Potter of New York on his re
marks anent certain practices alleged by
the former gentleman to have been, and
were being, committed down there.
Throughout the East, and at Rome al3o.
where he. together with the Archbishop
his party met. he has been listened to
wlthmarked attention.
He is now home and on the evening of
August 8, at Metropolitan Temple, he will
deliver a lecture which he has styled
"Philippine Observations," for the benefit
of Holy Cross Church,, with which he was
identified aa assistant pastor for six years.
The funds go toward paying off the debt
on . the new church or this Holy Cross*
parish, which is situated on Eddy street,
near Devisadero.
\Y"hen the First Regiment of California
Volunteers left for the Philippines the
Archbishop of San Francisco selected
Rev. Father Joseph P. McQuaide to go
there to assist the chaplain of that regi
ment. . He remained there until compelled
by sickness to leave, and instead of com

Last Friday night a dispute arose over a
trivial matter in the Tarrantina home.
Words led to blows and a vicious attack
was n:ade upon the woman. Mrs. Tarran
tina was alone at the time and fought un
til she was disabled. The younger Bale
streri led in the asaault and hia brutal
work was encouraged by his father, who
stood near by urging him on. -The uncle
himself, according to Mrs. Tarrantina.
dealt her several severe blows which add
ed greatly to her injuries.
Dr. Lorenza Mlchieli of 429*4 Broadway
was called. At first the case did not seem
to be of a very serious nature, but within
the past two days the woman's condition
has become critical. A wound on the IÂ«rft
side, where she was kicked, is causing the
most trouble. f~-~
Mr3. Salvator Tarrantina, who resides
at S10 Battery street. Is in a critical con
dition, the result of a beating she received
at the bands of her nephew, Mariana
Balestreri, and her uncle, Augustina
Balestreri, about three nights ago. The
woman was horribly kicked and bruised
about the body and head, and the physi
cians attending her fear she may not re
cover. . The police at the California-street

Last night- a number of additional po
lice officers were detailed oh the Bar
bary'Coast to prevent the soldiers : from
repeating Monday night's outrages.
The danger to citizens through soldiers
being allowed to carry their revolvers
while away from camp has been exempli
fied on more than one occasion, notably
the murder In the Spreckela Market by
Private Rosser of the Tennessee Regi
ment, and another case which fortunately
did not have a tragic ending occurred
early yesterday morning.
Several colored soldiers were drinking
in the saloon at E2G% Pacific street when
a row started and one of the soldiers
pulled a revolver out of his pocket and
tired a shot at a white man. The bullet
fortunately missed its mark. The soldiers
fled from the saloon and Sergeant Chris
tiansen was unable to get any clew to
the identity of the -would-be nrurderer.
The sergeant reported tho matter to
Chief Sullivan yesterday morning and the
chief sent the following letter to Major
General Shatter:
Major General 'William R. Shafter, ! Com
manding Department of California. U. S. A. â
Dear Sir: On going through the Chinese quar
ter last night I observed several soldiers in
that district carrying their army revolvers.
I am in receipt this morning of a report from
the sergeant â¢ In charge of- that district that
at 12:35 a. m. a colored soldier tired a Bhot
from his pistol at a white man in a ealouti
at 626% Pacific street. My object in writing to
you Â¦ Is to respectfully request that an order
be Issued prohibiting the men stationed at the
Presidio, when on leave, from carrying with
them their revolvers. I am sure that If this
is done It. will prevent trouble in the future
of such a nature as would be very discreditable
to the army and to the city of San Francisco.
Thanking you in anticipation- for' this favor.
I am, very truly yours, - . .

"Yes," was Rogers' answer. :-* :
"Did you recognize the fact "that an af
tornc-y at law siiould at, all times be will
ing to assist vhe court in tho investiga
tion of all wrongs?" ' : " Â¦;
"The doctrine you announce Is correct."
answered RuE.-ret. evasively; "but I dontt
pee what that has to do with this case,
pud 1 objc-<;t to the question."
Here- the court took a hand and said:
"You, are not supposed to object , to any
of those questions under the- present cir
cumstances, and I will hear no objection
from you except on the one ground that
to answer would tend to convict you of a
felony/.'
"If you recognized that doctrine." per-
F'Ptcd Deuprey. "why did ' you not apply
it In this rase?"
"I as<k to be protected "from this imper
?.inr-nt line of questions." said Rogers,
turrins to the court, but Judge Cabanlss
â¢fefc^lD&d w consider . the question imper-
"There was an investigation ' before
Judge Troutt "â¢ began Deuprey. '
"An alleged investigation." corrected
nogern.' Â° Â¦
"You wero a witness there?"
Deuprey calicd the attention of the
court to the fact that the witness could
not be a judge of what crimf his testi
mony would tend to convict him of. nor
o<iuld the court allow fcis -claim until it
was satisfied by some evidence that in
jury would follow. Judge Oabaniss said
he, was tsatislled in his own mind, and so
thf <4uestions were not aliowed.
Deuprey took up thf examination of the
witness on different lines/
The Rogers matter was taken up first.
Sim-e Monday Judge Cabaniss has been
looking up the law on the subject and he
had reached the conclusion that under the
provisions of the constitution of the
l.'nited States Rogers could not be com
pelled to testify â¢ against himself. The
Judge thought if the witness answered
some of the questions put to him it would
amount to testimony against himself. The
court r^afoned that if Rogers answered
that ho had had cooversaiions Â¦with Chre
tien and Chretien ha/1 offered him money
he would be in a much worse position, If
his case ever came to trial, than if he had
said nothing. Therefore Judge- Cabaniss
â¢was of the opinion that Rogers* answers
would be injurious to him.
John M. Chretien was bound over yes
terday to answer to the charge of forgery
in the Superior Court, and James Taylor
Rogers was given the cold comfort of im
munity from answering questions on the
Kround that if he answered any of them
hie conviction as a felon Â¦would follow.
That ended the Chretien case before
Judge Cabaniss.
Efforts to Have Judg-e Cabaniss Re
duce the Bail of Attorney Held
for Trial Meets With
Failure.
Elder Lawyer Excused Be
cause He Might Jeopar
dize Himself.
ROGERS ANSWERS
NOT, BUT COURT
HOLDS CHRETIEN
"I did not think the court had Jurisdic
tion." Rogers answered again.
"Did you not know that the honor of
your profession, the legal profession, was
at stake?"
"No. except through the newspapers."
"Did you not decline to answer ques
tions in regard to your connection with
thÂ» case?"
"No; I made certain objections and they
were overruled, and then I answered."
"Did you answer whether or not you
had received JGOO from Rauer to withdraw
from the case?" "
"Yes. I did." boldly asserted Rogers.
"What was your answer?" demanded
Deuproy. And then Henley, who had re
mained quiet during the proceedings, took
a hand.
"It is plain to me," he said, "that this
examination is not for the purpose of
securing evidence in the case before the
court, and I object to the direction this
examination is taking."
Deuprey answered by saying that the
only crime of which Rogers could be con
victed, assuming the charges implied by
the questions to be true, was extortion,
and all the answers he could make would
only go to show guilty knowledge. They
would also tend to show that Chretien
had been willing to back up a bogus heir
by buying off other claimants, and by
that means the fraudulent character of
his acts could' be more clearly shown.
Judge Cabaniss ruled, however, that the
question came within the protection af
forded the Â¦witness by the constitution,
and bo' he ruled the question out.
As a matter of fact, when the question
was put to Rogers before Judge Troutt
he denied that he had received any money
from any one connected Â¦with the case.
Deuprey then announced that he had
finished with Rogers and had finished
with the case against Chretien, and im
mediately Barnes arose and said there
was no defense.
Barnes continued In a plea for low ball
for Chretien. He said the offense was
certainly one that permitted of bail, and
he did not see why bonds of $10,000 had
been fixed for a crime that involved only
$2300. He asked the court to reduce the
ball when It. bound the prisoner over to
answer.
Deuprey objected. He said it was not the
amount involved bo much as the character
of the offense that should determine the
amount of the bail, and In the case of
the prisoner, he. said, the offense, was ag
gravated by the fact that he had preyed
upon the estates of the dead and had for
gotten his oath as an attorney, and had
attempted to violate the temple of Justice
itself. Such a bond as would Insure the
presence of the defendant, repardless of
the amount involved, was the proper bail
he thought. And then he called attention
to the fact that Chretien had declared
that he would go to the Orient if he could,
and he intimated that, unless the. ball
were fixed fairly high, there was danger
that, the prisoner would not appear when
he was wanted. .
The Judge thought a moment and then
Jssued an order holding Chretien to an
swer before the Superior Court on a
charge of forgery, with bail fixed at $10.
000âwhat It was before. There is another
charge hanging over Chretien, so it is safe
to say he will remain In Jail.
The stoppage of proceedings before the
Police Court regarding Rogers' connection
with the probate frauds is only a respite,
for the case Is still under consideration
by the Grand Jurv. and it will probably
be taken up next Friday, for the Jury has
been awaiting developments "in the lower
tribunal. . Â¦Â¦--Â¦Â¦
tinent. and Deuprey repeated it.
"I did apply It." paid Rogers, "but I did
not think then, nor do I believe now, that
the court had jurisdiction."
"Did you not recognize that the court
was endeavoring the investigate a wrong
committed?"
"T diri tint tVilnt tho *Â»mirt had inHsrtfn-

"Did Mlsa Rattigan tell you your mother

"She did not. When I proposed to takÂ»

My common sense told me that my
mother was dead and that this was Mis*
Rattlgan's delicate way of breaking It to
me. I did not ask her if my mother wero
dead, but drew my own conclusions."
Dr. Heintz later te3tilled that Miss Rat
tigan told Mrs. Murray in his presence
that Mrs. Townsend was dead.
"I rested on the staira for a few min
utes," continued Mrs. Murray, "and ther*
went up to the bathroom and saw the re-**
mains of my mother. I knelt beside ht>M
and prayed to Almighty God for strength
to bear it."
Mrs. Murray's voice trembled and her
eyes filled with tears, but a moment later
she bridled at a question concerning tha
keys, and said with pugnacious emphasia
that she did not toucn the body, as sha
was aware that was the Coroner's duty.
: She had not inquired the cause of her
mother's death and could not identify tha
morphine pill box.
Judga Paterson ventured to ask Mrs.
Murray, with doubt in his tone. If sha

"Yes, sir!" the witness retorted withi
emphasis that made attorneys and juror*
start &4. at a thunder clap.

The witness Lad not told her relatives In

California. She had been here once in
1332 and again In 1V.H.
"What particular key were you looking}
for when you wanted the body searched?"
was asked of her.
"I was not lookiner for any key. MIsÂ«

asked Deputy Coroner Brown to search
for the little red purse."
"You watched while the search wa*
' made?" asked JuÂ«l>:e Paterson.
"I looked as you would have looked IS
your mother had dropped dead." repliei
the witness, with much more anger than
sorrow In her voice. Judge Sullivan raisÂ«-<l
objections, and during the wrangle that
followed Judge Paterson's sensational
statement came. -
Dr. J. P. E. Helntz followed Mrs. Mur
ray on the witness-stand. Dr. Charles L.
Morgan, the chemist, who analyzed th*
stomach of deceased, said no trace of
morphine was found. Dr. T. TV*. B. Le
land, the autopsy surgeon, told the results
of the autopsy.
Harry \V. Morosco and Police Officer
Alexander gave unimportant testimony,
and after Attorney Asher's unsuccessful
attempt to get the inquiry continued until
the letters in Bradford's possession coul'i
be obtained, the case was submitted to,
the jury. i
A verdict of death from syncope &v<\(
hypertrophy of the heart, from natural
causes, was agreed upon by the jury
with very little discussion. The Jurors
were as follow:
Fred B. Haight, foreman; J. F. Halton,
John M. Ratto. Ed Smith. Morris Mar
cuse, J. H. Newbauer. Edward Wolf. J. J.
Cafferty. F. B. Dallance and EL B. Grace.
Attorney Asher said after the verdict
was given that he considered the Inquest
farcical as far as getting at the bottom
of the tragedy was concerned. He Inti
mated that he might apply to have th*
verdict set aside and another inquest held.
Asked If he intended to make another ap
plication for an order to search the Town
send residence for the secret panel cf
which Mrs. Bessie Smith claims to have
knowledge, he said: -
"We ahall do so as soon aa a probate

INSINUATIONS THAT MRS. ALMIRA TOWNSEND WAS

Ex- Judge Van R. Paterson Makes Sensa
tional Statements Founded on a Let
ter From C. C. Bradford, Who Says
Mrs. Townsend Was Filled With Fear.
WE might as well meet the issue now and here. This jury has
been called to determine the cause of Mrs. Townsend's death.'
It is not for counsel to say whether she died by poison ad
ministered by herself or se one else. In order to cause
death it is not necessary that the blow be given on the spot or that
the poison be given the moment before the breath leaves the body.
We are not here to charge this lady with anything improper, but
we desire to lay every bit of evidence as to cause of death before
the jury. I say to your Honor that, incredible as it may seem, we
are in receipt of information which directly connects this witness
[Mrs. Murray] with her mother's death, libelous and defamatory
though it may be."

"" R. Paterson. of counsel for Joseph
W. Cnjjurri. brother of the dead woman.
Uttered sensational words that preclpl
t;u. ij an exchange of angry statements
between counsel and greatly excited the
auditors. Judge Paterson declared that a
lottiT had been received directly connect
ing Mrs. Ella F. Murray with her
mother'* death. The scene after he had
the words was a mere dramatic
one than la often seen even in the home
of thrilling situations, the public Morgue
inquÂ«'<l room.
Judge P.-itirson's words were uttered
wiin biting emphasis that must have
made them sink <u-ep into the scul of the
witness on Â»he Mar.d at the time, Mrs.
Klia l-\ Murray, who shuddered with hor
ror as the terrible insinuation came forth.
A lonji -drawn, almost inaudible, "Oh!"
was the only sound the daughter of the
dead woman uttered, and then with
*=lÂ»hir.y-liko self-control she waited for her
i-.: :.. Treys to interpose objections to her
aecu:tr> statements.
"We might as well meet the issue now
ar.d here, ' exclaimed Judge Paterson.
"This jury has beÂ«"n called to determine
the cause of Mrs. Townsend's death. It is
not for counsel to detciraine whether she
died by poison administered by herself or
Mime one else. In order to cause death it
is not necessary that the blow be given on

. Ex-Judp<> Jeremiah Sullivan of Sullivan
A- Sullivan, attorneys for Mrs. Murray,
was on his feet instantly, objecting io
what he termed the libelous statements
of Judfre Paterson. Justice of the Peace
Barry, who was presiding in the absence
of CoroÂ«t-r Cole, ruled that the informa
tion that Judge Paterson was trying to
vt from the witness was not relevant to
the* Inquest. Then Judge Paterson fol
lowed with a denunciation scarcely IeÂ«s
sensational than the rirst. He said:
Â¦ "Thon you rule that we have no right
to show the motives of this witnessâ to
show her relations to her mother: rela- :
tioi:p that were not those of a natural
daughter. This woman entered the house
where her dead mother, lay, took possej
sion of it and barricaded it against rela
tives. HÂ«-r action in this matter displaytd
motives that are not such as actuate a
daughter if she is acting honestly."
Justice Barry paid that only evidence
bearing directly upon the death or reie
var.t to happenings on the day of thi:
death would be admitted. Judge Pater
son asked:
"Suppose that we can show a conspiracy
existing the day before to kill this woman,
would you admit that in evidence?"
"Do you dare." shouted Judge Sullivan,
"to assort the existence of any i-uch evl
dÂ«-nre?"
Miitt Sullivan was also on his feet and
the brothers both seemed in a rag-j.
PARTIES IN INTEREST AND ATTORNEYS AT THE INQUEST ON MRS. TOWNSEND.
Townsend showed It to me several years
ago and said it contained morphine pills;
that they had caused the death of a dear
friend and that in consequence she had a
perfect dread of morphine."
Purse Held Safe Deposit Key.
Witness was sure that Mrs. Townsend
had never shown any evidence of suicidal
tendencies and that she was not brooding
over any trouble during the last week of
her life or after Mrs. Murray's arrival
from the East. She was busy with plans
to aid the Ninth of September celebration.
Miss Rattigan denied any knowledge of
a secret cabinet in the California-street
residence. She said that she and Mra.
Murray were anxious that the body be
searched for a small red purse In which
Mrs. Townsend always carried a safe de
posit key. Deputy Coroner Brown search
ed but found no purse. The witness was
not present afterward when the safe de
posit box was opened. .
.- Dr. Henry J: Sartorl made a contribu
tion.- in his testimony, of a character
study of Miss Rattigan. According to
him, she. hurrying to get him to come to
the aid of her dear friend and patron, had
asked him to summon a lawyer If he knew
of one conveniently near. Dr. Sartori had
not thought that part of his professional
duty and no lawyer was summoned. He
found that Mrs. Townsend was dead when
he arrived. Miss Rattlgan's father,
mother and sister came soon afterward
and Miss Rattigan went to get Mrs. Mur
ray. Witness went otu to telephone to
Shortridge and Colonel George H. Pippy,
appointed by the court as attorneys for
the absent heirs, were in attendance,
though neither offered any suggestions or
asked any questions.
The inquest began with a tilt between
the lawyers. Judge Paterson said that
the autopsy and examination of the stom
ach were held at the request of Joseph
W. Coburn. Judge Sullivan claimed that
Paterson was mistaken and that the in
quest was being held at the request I of
his client. Mrs. Murray. Hugo Ascher
came to bat. He said that he had sug
gested the analysis of the stomach and
the Inquest. .-.,:.
Only the Chinaman "Was There.
Ying. the Chinaman, the only servant of ,
the Townsend household, was the first
witness. He told of Mrs. Townsend's re-'
turn from the theater at about 11:30
o'clock on Saturday night, July 21. She
was very ill and he helped her upstairs.
Miss Rattigan. who had come with her,
went home. He prepared some meat and
fruit for Mrs. Townsend and took the
food to her room. In about fifteen minutes
she called him and told him to go for Miss
Rattigan and tell her to get a doctor ami
tell him to bring morphine. He hurried
to Miss Rattisan's home on Clay street
and aroused her. He returned alone and
waited for Miss Rattigan and they went
upstairs and found Mrs. Townsend in the
bathroom, dead. When asked to identify ;
the box of morphine pills found on the Â¦
washstand In the bathroom he said, I
"Never saw boxâ never saw anything."
Dr. J. P. McCone testified to having
treated Mrs. Townsend on July 14 and
having diagnosed her trouble as neuralgia
of the heart and enlargement of the
heart muscle.
Miss Rattigan, who had acted for sev
eral years as a confidential secretary to
Mrs: . Townsend, Â¦was called. She was in
deep mourning and gave her evidence in
even tone3 without any show of emotion
other than some anger at questions of the
attorneys for Coburn.
Witness testified that she 'received no
salary from Mrs. Townsend â her work
being performed simply as a friend. She
retold the story of returning from the
theater and being called about 1 o'clock
by Ylng, who gave her Mrs. Townsend's
message.
"I told one of my relatives," said the
witness, "to call a cab, as from my knowl
edge of Mrs. Townsend's condition I
thought I might need it."
Miss Rattigan told without a tremor of
finding Mrs. Townsend's bodv lying life
less on Its face in the bathroom. Then Dr.
Sartorl came and she entered the cab and
went to. the , Palace Hotel . to get Mrs.
Murray. She told the last named that her
mother was dead. She had not seen Mrs.
Murray before, but knew of her arrival
July 9 at Mrs. Townsend's residence and
of Mrs. Townsend's visits to her at the
hotel.
When shown the box of morphine pills.
Miss Rattigan said:
"I have seen the box several times. Mrs.
Justice Barry quelled the storm of words
with difficulty.
I/etter Containing Charges.
"Since counsel cannot get along in
peace." the acting Coroner said. "1 will
conduct the examination myself," and he
did it by promptly excusing the witness
Mrs. Murray was led from the stand by
Judge Sullivan. She had occupied, with
Judge l'aterfon. the center of the stage
in the dramatic scene, but she made her
exit with tearless eyes and perfect self
control.
Judge Paterson's reference applied to
the information contained in a letter re
eejved yesterday at noon from Charles
C. Bradford and his wife. Ehza Bradford.
a sister of Mrs. Townsend. from Ka-st
Boston, dated July 25. Attorney Asher
gave the letter to Justice Barry with the
request that he read it and decide whether
the investigation should not follow broad
er lines than a mere inquiry Into the
events of July 21 and 22. Me said counsel
for Coburn had telegraphed for the letters
written by Mrs. Townsend to which refer
ence was made in the letter submitted and
he suggested that the inquest be con
tinued until the arrival of these letters.
The acting Coroner's ruling was against
the attorney and tue proceedings con
tinued.
Judge Paterson and Asher refused to
give the letter out for publication. Attor
ney Asher said that in it Bradford told
of receiving letters from Mrs. Townsend,
expressive of the shock Mrs. Murray's ar
rival had caused her and her Increasing
perturbation over Mrs. Murray's presence
in San Francisco. Other facts and conclu
sions drawn by Bradford, which the at
torney could not disclose, were contained
in the letter.
Judge Paterson's outburst had followed
objections that were made to questions
asked by him of Mrs. Murray regarding
her reason for asking the deputy Coroner
to search her mother's body for a certain
red purse that she knew her to possess
and regarding the anxiety of witness to
possess herself of that purse and the key
which it was supposed to contain.
Judge Sullivan and his brother objected
to the introduction of evidence not direct
ly connected with the death of the de
ceased, whether tending to show motives
or probable cause for suicide or Indirect
cause of death from heart failure. Justice
Barry was In accord with their views and
the investigation was confined within nar
row limits. The jury's verdict was the
only one possible from the evidenceâ death
from natural causes.
The Inquest was crowded with moments
of Intense Interest. Ylns. the Chinese
servant; Miss XeIHe Rattisan, and Mrs.
Murray appeared as most dramatic char
acters. Throughout the testimony of the
two women there was apparent a fear of
giving out something that would go
against them in the impending litigation,
against which they braced themselves
with a coldness and pugnacity that
showed a striking resemblance in their
characters.
Seldom has such an array of legal talent
gathered at an inquest.
The Sullivans were there for Mrs. Mur
ray. Judge Paterson and Hugo Asher ap
peared for Joseph W. Coburn, brother of
Mrs. Tovrnsend, and Gustave Gunsendor
fer for Thomas T. Townsend, the divorced
husband of the deceased. Samuel M.

Alex Strang, one of the riveters, was
severely burned about the hands and
arms. The other workmen escaped In-
Jury. A number of bags in the boiler
room were set on fire by the oil but the
flames were extinguished with but little
damage.
Hamilton and his companions were
patching the Alameria's boilers and were
at work with a machine for Â¦ heating
rivets. An oil tube leaked, letting a pool
of oil collect on the iloor. A boy who
was holding a lamp to give the riveter*
light to work by dropped the lamp on
the floor. The pool of oil Ignited and in
stantly an explosion followed, throwing
burning oil all over Hamilton.
The unfortunate man was taken to the
Harbor Receiving Hospital and from there
to the City Receiving Hospital. He re
tained consciousness and displayed most
remarkable fortitude, showing most con
cern for his wife and child, for whom he
asked repeatedly. The physicians at the
hospitals say that It was one of the most
severe cases of burning that has come un
der their notice.
Hamilton was completely enveloped by
the flames and every stitch of clothing
was burned from his body. There was
scarcely a square inch of surface of his
body that was not burned and In many
places the flesh was burned to a crisp.

GEORGETOWN. Ky., July 3Lâ The di
rect testimony of ex-Secretary of State
Caleb Powers as a witness in his own
behalf was concluded this afternoon ani
the cross-examination, which will take up
ii least all ot to-morrow, had progressed
only a short way when the court ad
journed.
While on the stand in the morning Pow
ers said that on the morning' of the as
sassination he was preparing to go to
Louisville to make ammgemenls for
bringing more people to Frankfort. He
locked nis office door as described by
WHness Gulden. He had no recoliectlon
of anything being saJd concerning his
previous actions, which Golden had rc
lerred to.
At 1-ag ranee the party heard that Goc
bel .â¢...Â¦: been assassinated and that the
shut iiad l>een lirÂ«rd I'tom the second or
third story of the executive building. The
Witness continued:
'"1 said U was a shame and an outrage
and that It would blight the plans of all
cl us whose otiices were in contest. I ex
|irfsrd in> sentiments to other people
tl>ai day."
\\ ltuets said that the statement of Gol
den lhat he spoke derisively when told
Of the shooting wajs a-osoluteiy false. He
denied tha.t he had made a statement to
Gulden that he was satisfied the shots
canitr from his ottice and stated that he
oid not tell him that he was thinking of
going' to the commonwealth's attorney
to ttil all he knew. He cid have a. taJk
with ciovernor Bradley about going to
fcte Frar.klUi, but was advised against it
and did bOl go.
The witness denied that he had ever had
any one of a. half a. dozen or more con
versations with Wbartun tJolden. con
cenniig which the latter had testitlcd
last week, and denied . tnat he had ever
talked with him or anybody else about
the itiiling of tioebel or aJiy member of
the LegiMature. He denied also the tes
timony of a similar character given by
Robert Noakes.
Jn regard to the guns In his office, which
McKeiizie Todd. tiovernor Taylor's pri
vate secretary, referred to in his testi
mony. Powers said he did not know how
they came there, but understood that; one
or two of them were left ther* at the end
of Governor Bradley's administration. The
others were put In there later, he sup
jxjsed. by mountaineers.
He denied that he had mada â¢ certain
statements to Miss Susie Snuffer of Wil
liamsburg 1 , or that he offered her any in
ducement to leave the State and not tes
tify aga.lnt=t him.
1 "I did s=ay to her." the witness contin
ued, "that 1 was surprised to tee her here,
as she had not been summoned. She said
they told her she had to come and that
t=hÂ«> did not have money enough to leave
the State. I did offer to loan her some
money and she might have used this as
she taw Jit. I did not recall having; had
such a conversation with her as she
t-laimed. but I did not want her to testify
against me, and I had rather now that she
had not done so."
The witness told of a letter which he
had received from Robert Xoakes In
March. In the letter, he said, Noakes'of
fered his services as a witness, saying
that he would disprove the charges made
against witness by Wharton Golden,
Â¦whose confession was being given a great
attention by the newspapers at that time.
The direct examination being concluded
the croES-oxamination was commenced by
Colonel Campbell, wlio said to the wit
nfp?: "You have stated that the men you
brought to Frankfort. January 25, were
Rood citizens and did not contain any
mountain feudists. Do you know Joseph
A-ikins. who is reputed to have killed a
half doz^n men?"
The witness said hÂ«" had no recollection
nf Boeing Atfkins in Frankfort until after
the assassination.
A dozen others of questionable charac
ter were als=o mentioned as being on the
train, but witness only identified a fow
of them. This line of interrogation was
still under way when the court adjourned.

IS years of age. Three years ago last
October the boy was practically kid

The owner of the sloop Roma is Cap

the rescue of the boy from his Indian

far north as Skeena liiver. On the
way down he met a party of Indian
fishermen who were on their way to
the Princess Royai cannery to fish.
His attention was attracted to the
youth, who was in an exceedingly tat

follow*?:
"Three years ago laj?t October, in
Vancouver. I was. engaged by a half
breed :named Robertson to help in a
store and postoffice which he said he
kept at Hartley .Eay. 300 miles up the
coast. Before making the arrangement
I inquired of him what kind of a place
it was, and was told it was quite a
little town, with electric lights and
good car service. Reassured I engaged
with him and we both took passage
on the Fteamer Princess Louise. Ques
tioned by the steward I told where I
was s^oing and he advised me not to
land at Hartley Bay, as nobody lived
there but Indians. I took no heed of
the advice, but on the arrival of the
steamer at that place I went ashore
with Robertson and then ended my
communication with civilization. The
Indians burned all letters and my step
father in Winnipeg must think that I
am dead. On steamer days I was kept
In the hoi:se by the Indians. A stray
prespector called once in awhile whose
curiosity was satisfied by being t.ojd I
was Robertson's brother. This I
nied before his= face, more than once.

Dr. Joseph Ellinwood of this city,
when seen last- night, said that he
never had any nephew named James

doctor added, "I have no nephew at
all whose present whereabouts I do

There are some interesting: French sub
jects 1n Mr." Robinson's studio, the. pans
at St. Cloud, the. Luxembourg andsoma

very -subtle and delicate handling. J From
a balcony at Naples and some Calif oraian
subjects are abo interesting. â¢ ' . ,
Mr. Robinson Is a native of Nova Scotia,
educated in hi3 art partly in Boston,
partly in the art schools of Paris, but
more particularly through independent
study during a delightful -artistic vaga
bondage which took in all the principal
French and Italian galleries. The youns
student â he is now but 23â found the man
nerisms, conventions and traditions of the
Parisian art schools but little to his lik
ing, and his sojourn among them was of
the briefest. Hut though he declined to
i permit the conventional and mediocre
methods of tho schools to affect his indi
viduality as an artist. It is very evident
from his work that Mr. Robinson was
powerfully influenced by the , Whistler
movement In Paris.
In the "Portrait of a Young Man" ex
hibited in the Salon du Champs de Mars
of 1SB0. the first picture by Mr. Robinson
to attract tho attention of critics.. tbÂ«
I Whistler influence is noticeably apparent.
t It is still more in evidence in other work
of hisâ tr.e reach after an absolutv sim
plicity oi treatment, after the elusive,
poetic, forbiiMen mysteries of tone, an ut
termost synthesis in effectâ in contradis
tinction to the detailed and garrulous m
art.
About such work It Is difficult to proph
esy the end. That Mr. Robinson has not
attained his ultimate method of expres
sion I? apparent, but with his earnestness
absolute sincerity and utter avofilance of
the effective slang of painters bo much tii
evidence to-day the final result should be
well worth while.
As a reversal of th* usual order of
things,. it is pleasant to announce in the
coming of Boardman Michael Robinson.- to

Â¦â¢The Call has had occasion so frequently to publish
letters commending the "studies" from men [ and
women eminent in intellectual .life that; the value -of
the praise given in the Academy article is due mainly
to the fact that it .shows how wide has become the
interest in the subject and howmuch attention it is
attracting from thoughtful persons of all classes.- It
is satisfactory to be able to bear witness that the in
terest is general among the people of California, and
that those who have followed the various courses of
study are among the most earnest in commending
their. educational value. â¢â¢ , â¢". = i ' ' .â¢ -

A NOTEWORTHY COMMENDATION.
V 7ERY rarely do the learned scholarswhocontrib
\f' 7 ute the' papers to the "Annals of the American
â¢ Academy"; condescend to take note of what is
going on in the domain of journalism; and when they
do it is generally for the purpose of condemning, ; or
at least of disapproving, the methods that, prevail in
the work of the daily press. The swiftness with which
the news of the world is gathered, digested and pub
lished docs not commend itself to men who take a
week'to investigate the Â¦slightest; subject and a month
to write out a report of it in what; they; regard, as
proper^literary form. ;Still there are times Avheh they
notice in the press something of sufficient value: ih
itself! to be studied for information, or ' of '" sufficient,
excellence and expression to be; accounted literature,
and then it is: gratifying to note: they do not hesitate
to give a voice of approval as .strong and emphatic as
is the common voice of adverse criticism. . â¢ ;

QUESTICNS FOR THE BflR.
THERE was probably no European more qualified to ex
press ah Opinion of the- Chinese than Colonel Gordon,
more commonly called Chinese Gordon, whose strange
.:' career closed at Khartoum in January, 1SS5, says the
New York Sun. His military association with them
durin" the two years from 1S63 to 1S65, when he commanded the
Ever Victorious army, as it was styled, gave him a unique ex
perlehcq of the Chinese and an Insight Into their somewhat
complex character. : Â¦ â¢ '.â¢ ': :^''- A---r-ry'--\ Â¦:.:Â¦':Â¦'Â¦ A y ' '^ ' *
Â¦-With the crudest of material and In spite of the strongest
opposition, an opposition that would have been fatal but for
thÂ£ loyal support h<i received throughout his short term of
ser\'ice under the Emperor of China from Li Hung Chang, he
organized a force that under European officers of nearly every
Â¦nationality; including some Americans, suppressed the Taeping
rebellion then threatening the existence of China and the
dynasty. : The pplntons he expressed, therefore, have at the
present moment exceptional value. :..;-; . Voo. Â».
One which he gave cpnfldentially to a friend In 1SS0 when
he was Just on the point of leaving for India, where he had
accepted the post of secretary cf the Viceroy, Lord Ripon, is
ju=t now of particular interest. Speaking of the Chinese
trbops. he xlchfed that they were cowards In one sense. He
held that they did nbt fear death, though he had seen them
stand lip bravely sometimes and then flee like sheep afterward.
But what Europeans would have to .consider was, he said, the
awful conseciuenceB ' Of a general ' movement, when least ex-
Dected in the vast Inert, mass of hundreds of millions of men
to overwhelm the foreign devils -vhom they hatelike poison.
The danger of such an . Gordon- said,- became
greater every year on account of the way: the Chinese were
being continually harassed by the European states with dfr
mauds for compensations, in some cases Just, in others quits
frivolous. AVhen they saw that their only means of meeting
the agrgressions was to organize an army with Improved
Â¦preapons. then they would buy gun* and rifles and ships, and
Â¦w ith the aid of Kuropeans, who would: always he found ready
to drill and organize them, they would create.; a formldable>
array. ': '""Â¦:Â¦Â¦:'Â¦Â¦ - : ':': : -'';-: : f- r:-'' Â¦ 'Â¦Â¦'':Â¦'Â¦Â¦-Â¦':Â¦'Â¦ :-: : - : '--A r - "'- -_Â¦'"*'
Of one thing Gordon felt quite sure. The day* when Euro
peans could march up to Chinese troops in position, or In de
fense of a position, and sweep them away like flies, wonld sooa
be over. There would be no more military promenades by a
few hundred British and French troops through the country,
driving thousands of Chinese before them. ; ; ; v : Â¦ v
Speaking of the authorities. Gordon said a mandarin was
never to be trusted, and he was only too glad when he left
their service. The English, In his opinion, made the mistako
of thinking they were welcome wherever they went, but in
fifteen or twenty years they would find proof to the contrary.
"With all their superstitions, their vices and their ignorance,
the Chinese were. In Gordon's estimation, far too good; to be
ruled by the class that governed them. The governments of
France. Russia and England, he emphatically ; declared, had
for the forty years before the .'time., he spoke treated; the Chi
nese most scandalously. :.':-' AA---^-- '/A - : : -V :Â¦â¢Â¦'.?' â¢Â¦â¢ h Â¦ "Â¦Â¦'Â¦ Â¦'Â¦ Â¦ "'Â¦ Â¦Â¦Â¦â¢Â¦â¢ >~-
Current events are proving how accurately ChfnMe Gordon
judged the situation, and the regret is that certain defect* of
character and temperament should have caused h'm to aban
don a position In which he; could : have rendered great service
to China and civilization. In the light of what Is passing in
China to-day. Gordon's words of : twenty years ago have a

There are some interesting: French sub

Mr. Robinson Is a native of Nova Scotia,
educated in hi3 art partly in Boston,
partly in the art schools of Paris, but
more particularly through independent
study during a delightful -artistic vaga
bondage which took in all the principal
French and Italian galleries. The youns
student â he is now but 23â found the man
nerisms, conventions and traditions of the
Parisian art schools but little to his lik
ing, and his sojourn among them was of
the briefest. Hut though he declined to
i permit the conventional and mediocre
methods of tho schools to affect his indi
viduality as an artist. It is very evident
from his work that Mr. Robinson was
powerfully influenced by the , Whistler
movement In Paris.

hibited in the Salon du Champs de Mars
of 1SB0. the first picture by Mr. Robinson

plicity oi treatment, after the elusive,
poetic, forbiiMen mysteries of tone, an ut

tinction to the detailed and garrulous m
art.
About such work It Is difficult to proph
esy the end. That Mr. Robinson has not
attained his ultimate method of expres
sion I? apparent, but with his earnestness
absolute sincerity and utter avofilance of
the effective slang of painters bo much tii
evidence to-day the final result should be
well worth while.

V 7ERY rarely do the learned scholarswhocontrib
\f' 7 ute the' papers to the "Annals of the American
â¢ Academy"; condescend to take note of what is
going on in the domain of journalism; and when they
do it is generally for the purpose of condemning, ; or
at least of disapproving, the methods that, prevail in
the work of the daily press. The swiftness with which
the news of the world is gathered, digested and pub
lished docs not commend itself to men who take a
week'to investigate the Â¦slightest; subject and a month
to write out a report of it in what; they; regard, as
proper^literary form. ;Still there are times Avheh they
notice in the press something of sufficient value: ih
itself! to be studied for information, or ' of '" sufficient,
excellence and expression to be; accounted literature,
and then it is: gratifying to note: they do not hesitate
to give a voice of approval as .strong and emphatic as
is the common voice of adverse criticism. . â¢ ;

QUESTICNS FOR THE BflR.
THERE was probably no European more qualified to ex
press ah Opinion of the- Chinese than Colonel Gordon,
more commonly called Chinese Gordon, whose strange
.:' career closed at Khartoum in January, 1SS5, says the
New York Sun. His military association with them
durin" the two years from 1S63 to 1S65, when he commanded the
Ever Victorious army, as it was styled, gave him a unique ex
perlehcq of the Chinese and an Insight Into their somewhat
complex character. : Â¦ â¢ '.â¢ ': :^''- A---r-ry'--\ Â¦:.:Â¦':Â¦'Â¦ A y ' '^ ' *
Â¦-With the crudest of material and In spite of the strongest
opposition, an opposition that would have been fatal but for
thÂ£ loyal support h<i received throughout his short term of
ser\'ice under the Emperor of China from Li Hung Chang, he
organized a force that under European officers of nearly every
Â¦nationality; including some Americans, suppressed the Taeping
rebellion then threatening the existence of China and the
dynasty. : The pplntons he expressed, therefore, have at the
present moment exceptional value. :..;-; . Voo. Â».
One which he gave cpnfldentially to a friend In 1SS0 when
he was Just on the point of leaving for India, where he had
accepted the post of secretary cf the Viceroy, Lord Ripon, is
ju=t now of particular interest. Speaking of the Chinese
trbops. he xlchfed that they were cowards In one sense. He
held that they did nbt fear death, though he had seen them
stand lip bravely sometimes and then flee like sheep afterward.
But what Europeans would have to .consider was, he said, the
awful conseciuenceB ' Of a general ' movement, when least ex-
Dected in the vast Inert, mass of hundreds of millions of men
to overwhelm the foreign devils -vhom they hatelike poison.
The danger of such an . Gordon- said,- became
greater every year on account of the way: the Chinese were
being continually harassed by the European states with dfr
mauds for compensations, in some cases Just, in others quits
frivolous. AVhen they saw that their only means of meeting
the agrgressions was to organize an army with Improved
Â¦preapons. then they would buy gun* and rifles and ships, and
Â¦w ith the aid of Kuropeans, who would: always he found ready
to drill and organize them, they would create.; a formldable>
array. ': '""Â¦:Â¦Â¦:'Â¦Â¦ - : ':': : -'';-: : f- r:-'' Â¦ 'Â¦Â¦'':Â¦'Â¦Â¦-Â¦':Â¦'Â¦ :-: : - : '--A r - "'- -_Â¦'"*'
Of one thing Gordon felt quite sure. The day* when Euro
peans could march up to Chinese troops in position, or In de
fense of a position, and sweep them away like flies, wonld sooa
be over. There would be no more military promenades by a
few hundred British and French troops through the country,
driving thousands of Chinese before them. ; ; ; v : Â¦ v
Speaking of the authorities. Gordon said a mandarin was
never to be trusted, and he was only too glad when he left
their service. The English, In his opinion, made the mistako
of thinking they were welcome wherever they went, but in
fifteen or twenty years they would find proof to the contrary.
"With all their superstitions, their vices and their ignorance,
the Chinese were. In Gordon's estimation, far too good; to be
ruled by the class that governed them. The governments of

of construction on Serpentine avenue, off
Twenty-sixth street, between Mission
and Howard, and belonging to B. â¢ P.

issued by the Bureau- of Streets on Mon
day lsst for the erection of the building.
The board was Informed that the act of
the Legislature approved March 16, 1878,
closed Serpentine avenue and authorized
the sale of .the street land. The Mayor
was empowered to give the necessary
deeds, but it is understood by the board
that no deeds have been executed and the
land is now supposed to be the property
of the city. The Bureau of Streets will
cancel the permit and the ctwner will be
instructed to vacate the property.
William Mooser was appointed architect
of .the Board of Public Works yesterday
at a salary of J100 per month. He will
only devote a portion of his time to the
duties of the position. He will examine
all. plans for buildings and will be at the

Freud pledget! his commission, at Cas
serly's-suggestion, to prepare for a civil

Webster submitted a resolution request-
Ing the Chief of Police to continue Patrol
man C. T. Merchant as a truant officer
of the department, .by reason of his good
record. The board declined to adopt the
resolution. -however, as it- did not desire
to Interfere with, the prerogatives of the
Police Department.

year 1900-1901 shall be. such schools as had
during the fiscal year terminating June. 1900.

that, the function of the Board of-Educa^
tion granted it by. the State law to clas
sify grades had been taken away from ,lt
under the new charter; that according to
section Iitf3 of the Political Code the
County Superintendent of Schools had
Fole authority to grade schools, and this,
was backed by several court decisions
which he quoted. He then submitted the
following schedule as his order, which
was placed on file:
Director Denman said that the board
had transferred grammar grades from the
Grant School because they were not up
to the standard of enrollment, which had
been fixed . at fifty-five pupils per class.
Superintendent Webster action
taken immediately, so the parents could
be informed this morning, what they: were
to dp with their children,;, but the board
decided to tako the matter under advise
ment and give a reply to the petition of
ithe parents at Its earliest convenience. It
agreed to rectify any mistake that might
have been; made.': .â¢â¢ Â¦ â¢" : Â¦ Â¦' -.-Â¦ -.-. ". Â¦ : .
The last sentence in /the protest ap
peared to hurt the : sensibilities of the
School Directors, and as it was deemed
objectionable was withdrawn. by Some, of
the signers, who were present.: -Attorney
Ach explained that It would he a hard
ship to force parents to send their pupils
to a school which was in some cases fif
teen blocks away from their, homes. He
for one would not send, his child to. the
Pacilic Heights School, the drainage, of
which he paid was unhealthy. He claimed
there 'was plenty of room at .the Grant
School, though seventy pupils were sent
away from it yesterday. William Koss
and Livingston Jenks addressed the board
on the same lines.

bnard transfcrrirg the sixth, -seventh and
tlfhtii grades of primary *eh<x>Is cast: of Cen
tral avenue and north of Twphty-j>lxth street'
to the nearest grammar school has caused a
great deal of dissatistactfon. espectallj- among
parents t>f -children who attend "the:' Grant
School. We as taxpayers fail to see wherein
anything can be gained, by the ..tmnafer of
grammar grade pupils. If the classes are in
creased in the l'acinc Heights or
Schools the work of the teachers' must be In
creased " unduly and the. pupils suffer. In pro
portion and be denied the time and attention
(riven to pupils in- less crowded classes. .We
hope you will reconsider ' the resolution and
avoid the necessity of testing In the courts

Is made mandatory that the number of
pairs of : shoes respectively for men,
women and children shall be set forth;
also the net weipht in kilos of the shoes,
excluding the packing Inside and outside;
the net weight in kilos of the cartons or
small boxes inside and the gross weight
In kilos with packing inside and outside.
For tanned leathers the net and gross
weights in kilos must be specified.
"The Custom-house," so the regulations
read, "considers shoes for men being of
the measure of 23 ospanol." What that
means not a shoe manufacturer or dealer
In. shoes in San Francisco can tell; never-,
theless, the regulations run against them,
Â¦upon goods now -actually -'^crossing the
ocean and beyond possibility of being
measured and weighed in compliance
with the new rules. The regulations, so
it' i;s Just learned -here, went into, effect
June-1. â¢ Some .trouble'-'must have, been
caused already and more will ensue.un
less the authorities, at Washington, see
the: injustice and' give some-relief.- . :
â¢ â¢ In Its letter to' Secretary -Root- the! firm
Qf-Cahn; â¢ NIckelsbtlrg & Cq. . sets forth
that since the .United- States' has taken
possession of the Philippines a trade in
American-made shoes has been started,
and If there is no' increase in customs re
strictions it is quite sure that the business
will grow to large proportions! The hope
was expressed that nothing more than
the gross weight of, the package need be
specified in the Invoice and that the
customs rates on shoes may be as low
as possible to . promote the use on tho
Islands of American-made goods.
. The injustice threatened has led certain
prominent business men in San Francisco
to enter into 'correspondence with Secre
tary Root "of the War Department , and
also with. the olHcials at Manila, making
protest and asking for relief. . Pacilic
Coast manufacturers and merchants doing
business with the Philippine Islands are
hampered. ' The customs regulations ap
plied to the Philippines are more exacting
than- those of Cuba. This furnishes ad
ditional reason for local dissatisfaction.

The board filed yesterday with the
Mavor its semi-annual report covering the
operations of the department for the last
six months. After a brief history of the
proceedings in organizing for business the
report pays a high compliment to the pub
lic-spirited action of the Merchants' Asso
ciation in volunteeering substantial as
sistance. High praise is also accorded the
public school teachers who volunteered to
mark the examination papers, and to all
who in any way assisted the commission.
The report concludes with a tabulated
statement of the date of examinations,
number of applicants, number examined,
number passed, number failing and num
ber appointed, as follows:. â¢.-.
The Civil Service Commission is of the opin
ion that the active participation of civ;i %erv
ice ai>r*ointeÂ« > s In partisan politics, in the man
ner you describe, is cortrary to the spirit of
the charter, and subver..ivp to the best inter
ests of civil service. The merit system was in
troduced into the charter with the main idea
of removing the city's affairs from political in
fluence. The Civil Service Commission, there
fore earnestly recommends that all civil serv
ice appointees shall refrain from participation
in partisan politics./ ; . . â¢
The Board of Civil Service Commission
ers wrote a communication yesterday to
Charles Cosgrave. a copyist in the Hall of
Records^ In which he Is informed that the
board will not countenance any active In
terest in politics on the part of civil ser
vice appointees. Cosgrave had written
to the b/aard requesting, information
whether the commission had any objec
tion to appointees of the commission tak
ing an active Interest in Federal, Stato or
municipal politics, that is. joining dubs
and holding office in the same, participate

The Board of Public Works directed the
Chief of Police yesterday to order opera
tions to cease on a building now In course
of construction on Serpentine avenue, off
Twenty-sixth street, between Mission
and Howard, and belonging to B. â¢ P.
Hellwlg. A permit was inadvertently
issued by the Bureau- of Streets on Mon
day lsst for the erection of the building.
The board was Informed that the act of
the Legislature approved March 16, 1878,
closed Serpentine avenue and authorized
the sale of .the street land. The Mayor
was empowered to give the necessary
deeds, but it is understood by the board
that no deeds have been executed and the
land is now supposed to be the property
of the city. The Bureau of Streets will
cancel the permit and the ctwner will be
instructed to vacate the property.
William Mooser was appointed architect
of .the Board of Public Works yesterday
at a salary of J100 per month. He will
only devote a portion of his time to the
duties of the position. He will examine
all. plans for buildings and will be at the
disposal, of all departments of the board.

Webster submitted a resolution request-
Ing the Chief of Police to continue Patrol
man C. T. Merchant as a truant officer
of the department, .by reason of his good
record. The board declined to adopt the
resolution. -however, as it- did not desire
to Interfere with, the prerogatives of the
Police Department.

year 1900-1901 shall be. such schools as had
during the fiscal year terminating June. 1900.

that, the function of the Board of-Educa^

sify grades had been taken away from ,lt
under the new charter; that according to
section Iitf3 of the Political Code the
County Superintendent of Schools had
Fole authority to grade schools, and this,
was backed by several court decisions
which he quoted. He then submitted the
following schedule as his order, which
was placed on file:
Director Denman said that the board
had transferred grammar grades from the
Grant School because they were not up
to the standard of enrollment, which had
been fixed . at fifty-five pupils per class.
Superintendent Webster action
taken immediately, so the parents could
be informed this morning, what they: were

decided to tako the matter under advise

agreed to rectify any mistake that might
have been; made.': .â¢â¢ Â¦ â¢" : Â¦ Â¦' -.-Â¦ -.-. ". Â¦ : .
The last sentence in /the protest ap
peared to hurt the : sensibilities of the
School Directors, and as it was deemed
objectionable was withdrawn. by Some, of
the signers, who were present.: -Attorney
Ach explained that It would he a hard
ship to force parents to send their pupils
to a school which was in some cases fif
teen blocks away from their, homes. He
for one would not send, his child to. the
Pacilic Heights School, the drainage, of
which he paid was unhealthy. He claimed
there 'was plenty of room at .the Grant
School, though seventy pupils were sent
away from it yesterday. William Koss
and Livingston Jenks addressed the board
on the same lines.

bnard transfcrrirg the sixth, -seventh and
tlfhtii grades of primary *eh<x>Is cast: of Cen

great deal of dissatistactfon. espectallj- among

School. We as taxpayers fail to see wherein
anything can be gained, by the ..tmnafer of
grammar grade pupils. If the classes are in
creased in the l'acinc Heights or
Schools the work of the teachers' must be In
creased " unduly and the. pupils suffer. In pro
portion and be denied the time and attention
(riven to pupils in- less crowded classes. .We
hope you will reconsider ' the resolution and
avoid the necessity of testing In the courts

Cahn, Nlckelsburg & Co. have taken the
lead in making prottst. They are particu
larly concerned by reason of the provis
ions affecting the Invoicing of shoes. It
Is made mandatory that the number of
pairs of : shoes respectively for men,
women and children shall be set forth;
also the net weipht in kilos of the shoes,
excluding the packing Inside and outside;
the net weight in kilos of the cartons or
small boxes inside and the gross weight
In kilos with packing inside and outside.
For tanned leathers the net and gross
weights in kilos must be specified.
"The Custom-house," so the regulations
read, "considers shoes for men being of
the measure of 23 ospanol." What that
means not a shoe manufacturer or dealer
In. shoes in San Francisco can tell; never-,
theless, the regulations run against them,
Â¦upon goods now -actually -'^crossing the
ocean and beyond possibility of being
measured and weighed in compliance
with the new rules. The regulations, so
it' i;s Just learned -here, went into, effect
June-1. â¢ Some .trouble'-'must have, been
caused already and more will ensue.un
less the authorities, at Washington, see
the: injustice and' give some-relief.- . :
â¢ â¢ In Its letter to' Secretary -Root- the! firm
Qf-Cahn; â¢ NIckelsbtlrg & Cq. . sets forth
that since the .United- States' has taken
possession of the Philippines a trade in
American-made shoes has been started,
and If there is no' increase in customs re
strictions it is quite sure that the business
will grow to large proportions! The hope
was expressed that nothing more than
the gross weight of, the package need be
specified in the Invoice and that the
customs rates on shoes may be as low
as possible to . promote the use on tho
Islands of American-made goods.
. The injustice threatened has led certain
prominent business men in San Francisco
to enter into 'correspondence with Secre
tary Root "of the War Department , and
also with. the olHcials at Manila, making
protest and asking for relief. . Pacilic
Coast manufacturers and merchants doing
business with the Philippine Islands are
hampered. ' The customs regulations ap
plied to the Philippines are more exacting
than- those of Cuba. This furnishes ad
ditional reason for local dissatisfaction.

The board filed yesterday with the
Mavor its semi-annual report covering the
operations of the department for the last
six months. After a brief history of the
proceedings in organizing for business the
report pays a high compliment to the pub
lic-spirited action of the Merchants' Asso
ciation in volunteeering substantial as
sistance. High praise is also accorded the
public school teachers who volunteered to
mark the examination papers, and to all
who in any way assisted the commission.
The report concludes with a tabulated
statement of the date of examinations,
number of applicants, number examined,
number passed, number failing and num
ber appointed, as follows:. â¢.-.
The Civil Service Commission is of the opin
ion that the active participation of civ;i %erv
ice ai>r*ointeÂ« > s In partisan politics, in the man
ner you describe, is cortrary to the spirit of
the charter, and subver..ivp to the best inter
ests of civil service. The merit system was in
troduced into the charter with the main idea
of removing the city's affairs from political in
fluence. The Civil Service Commission, there
fore earnestly recommends that all civil serv
ice appointees shall refrain from participation
in partisan politics./ ; . . â¢
The Board of Civil Service Commission
ers wrote a communication yesterday to
Charles Cosgrave. a copyist in the Hall of
Records^ In which he Is informed that the
board will not countenance any active In
terest in politics on the part of civil ser
vice appointees. Cosgrave had written
to the b/aard requesting, information

more substantial barrier, was placed
across the track near Camphora, a small

for some five months previous to Decenir

"On the mornlnBr-of the twenty-fourth 01
December he took Fitzgerald to the train
at. Holy Cross Cemetery, when the latter
made the remark about : Lennon: "If I
put a bullet through that â â .
nothing would be aone to me,'' Fitzgerald
took the train for San Kranclsco and "wit
ness did not see him again that day. The
night before the. killing Fitzgerald and
Lennon had some words over a lantern

place after dark that night and went into
the house to procure a lantern. In going
from the dining room into, the kitchen he
stumbled over the legs of some person.
Upon : striking a light he found Lennon
dead. He. immediately notified some of

>XAKLAND. July 31.â "If the raur-
I 1 derer of my 'ther can be
V^ brought to justice I shall not
i-^y: spare money nor labor to uncover
crimes which 1 believe were committed to
compass his death." Â¦"jj ,_
Such was the declaraUon of feeler
Bayless to-day when he was brought face
to face with the strange chain of circum
stantial evidence which points to the as
sassination Of Joseph Bayless. the Oak
land pioneer, at his ranch .home near
Glencoe. ': ' . :, Â¦â¢-.:â¢.'Â¦. :' ',-' â¢ Â¦Â¦- . 'Â¦Â¦'Â¦ ' .-
It was by the merest chanceâ by the ac
cidental finding of an; empty cartridge
shellâ that a clew was found that has dis
closed enough to warrant the belief that
crime has been committed in connection
with the burning of the old rancher's
buildings and his death in the flames.
Although the neighbors of Bayless and
the peace officers of Calaveras tountj.
who were called to the : scfene. -were;
startled by the rumors ; of foul deed3

man's body was found. Then I looked
about me and noticed the big. blurred
footprints in the ground all around where
the. shell had lain. I decided to follow

which they give of their short-lived hap
piness. He waa only 33 years of age when
ho painted "The Night Watch,'* a work
pronounced by all critics his masterpiece.
This picture, sometimes called "The
Sortie," represents the sudden call to
arms of the civic guard under Captain
Frans Banning Cock. The guard is
emerging from its gutldhouÂ»e headed by
Its captain, who wears a dark brown, al
most black, costume. Next the leader
marches Lieutenant Rintenberg in a gor
geous jerkin of brilliant yellow. Pressing
forward out of the background., carry ing
their arms, can be seen the members of
the troop clad In somber tones, relieved
by flashes of color, while a gayly attired
girl with a dead cock hanging from her
erirdle stands to the left of the principal
figures. The flag carried by the flag
bearer waves aloft. The scheme of color
Is one beloved by Rembrandtâ a golden
yellow in contrast with black, relieved
and accentuated by touches of vermilion
and rich ultramarines. There is a
strength, a power and movement In thla
noble work which class It among the fivw
great pictures of the world and give to
Rembrandt first place in his art. ':
Here was a brave little country, cut off
by many causes from sympathy with !ts
neighbors, fighting not only against the
Inroads of the sea for its life, but for Its
very existence against the encroachments
of contiguous countries, and the almost
overwhelming Jealousies' of Spain. Lib
erty was the national cry, and having
won It against fearful odds its defenders
claimed the right to their own ideals. The
Dutch, like all wide-awake; vigorous and
successful people, . became, when once
convinced of their own = powers, tremend
ously interested In themselves, in each
other and in the things about them. They
were-, all Â¦ busy, and they felt - themselves
to be great. The dreamy,, the thoughtful,
the poetic and- the: visionary made no ap^
peal to them, as to the Latin racea. They
found their Ideals in the actual and the
every day. Their dreams were realities:
their poems were :the great deeds of which
There are many reasons why this sep
arateness, as It were, from the general
trend of European development Bhould in
evitably hold true of Holland.
The youngr painter who studies the gal
leries of Holland will soon discover that
the splendid and inspiring art of the
Dutch belongs to a school In itself, repre
senting a phase In European development
that is unique, altogether dlstfnct in its
impulses and ideals from those which ani

John C- Meyers Goes Twenty-Seven
FAST : - SWIMMING.
In his own previous works. He broke
away from tne conventional and the alle
gorical and spoke his meaning clearly,
basing It upon a study of nature, and yet
in doing: this he embodied the very whip
and spur of civic heroism. The student
will aiways find this quality of the spir
itual, as it were. In Rembrandt apart from
his technique and his art of composition.
His tinger Is on the .pulse of national feel
ing. He never misses the sincerity of
the old burphers nor their earnestness
nor their integrity. In his other great
picture at The Hague. "The Lesson In;
Anatomy." It is the spirit of science It
self which is exalted: the details which
might have created an impression of tha :
horrible are altogether subordinated to
the consecrated purpose of the Inquiring
mind.
Franz Hals, like Rembrandt, will never
let the student pass. He Is best studied
at Haarlem, although In the Ryks mu
seum, the Museum Van der Hoop and the.
Rathhaua, or town hall, at Amsterdam."
and again at The Hague and Rotterdam,
some splendid examples are shown. Â«At-
Haarlem, though, in the museum of the
town hall, are his eight greatest pictures.
This Dutchman paints with a virility
few men have equaled; not with the
muscles of his fingers, but with the mus
cles that start from the broad of- hi*
back, tingling along his arms and down
Into his finger tips; strong, fine strokes
each one a master. Every time b,e piles
up a little heap of pigments on his palette
smashes it with his brush and then de
livers it upon his canvas It is done with
the skill of a marksman, the- sureness of
a surgeon and the deftness of an engrav
er. He calculates In a flash the exact
amount of paint needed, blends the exact
tone, hits the exact spot and -obtains thÂ©
exact result. Our own John Sargent some,
times hits a similar mark, but I know of
no other painter of modern or.other times
who can and does. â
He lived in Haarlem, the city adorned
â¢ tÂ« c h i Is v ? . rea . te u t P alntIn ffs. dying there
in 1666 In his eighty-second or eighty-third
year. Stories of his life are as much at
variance as those which pictured Rem
brandt; but. like Rembrandt, he still
boasted many Important friends, and had
a wife whom he delighted to portray- In
his old age he received from the.
City Council. He Is the Velasquez of the
north and a master of the brush In compo
sition and In his grasp of character.
There are other Dutch masterpieces
which can be studied with profit tn the
three great galleries. At Amsterdam, in
the Ryks museum, for instance, is the
'â¢Banquet of the. Civic Guard." by Van
der Heist. He ranks next after Franz
Hals as a painter of portraits. The "Par
ro ( ,. s i' v a â¬ e -" bv Van SteenV and, the "Wat
prfall. by Ruysdael. are, In this gallery.
At The Hague one will find the "Chariot
de *oln. by "WouvermarÂ»;,'aÂ° celebrated
historical painter, and the o "Old Man In
H13 Study/' by Van Ostade. whose effects
In- chiaroscuro have given him eminence,
At Rotterdam are the /'Mussel Eater >;
by Cuyp. and the "Toung, Bull,'* by Paul
Potter. . ,
It Is difficult to understand whv thla
last example of bad realism by Potter
could have attained anything but noto
riety since the day It Waa slimed by its
creator. It is. perhaps, because the sub
ject is one familiar to all men. The pic
ture represents a boneless bull, standing
broadside on. attended by two members of
his family, and watched- over by a man
who must be either without legs or stand-
Ing In a hole three feet deep. The pa
tience with which the painter worked on
the hair which covers the bull's side*
and head could be commended If It were
not apparent that the size of each hair In
proportion to the size of the picture would
be- as large as the- handle Â©f the bruah
that painted, It. A Van Marck or Bon
heur hung beside this world-famous pic
ture would decrease Its popularity and
rob It of much of Its prestige.
A special study of the Dutch painters
must prove of inestimable value to the
American student. For we. t6o. are a
yrung people. We have suddenly proved
our powers and convinced our neighbors.
I ike the Dutch, we are Interested in our
selves, and we have about us artistic ma
te-rials which. If properly used, will not
r.nly Interest our own art lovers but thosÂ©
of the world. =

important,- having in some way-contrib
uted- to the. national success. That Is
why, too, that-which- is called genre paint
ing Â¦ attained ' peculiar eminence among
these people. -â¢ ft' sprung from an Interest
in surrounding things* and corresponds to
what we call local color in fiction or ab
sorption In details. .: This. too. is why they
excel, as they do : : in portraiture; every
man Koldiiig a civic position: having been
paintedâ every roisterer Â¦ of prominence,
every -soldier, every innkeeper..- / Â¦
It must not be forgotten, too, that the
religion of the pedple Isolated them In
their art from the ideals or the Latin
races a.nd affected their art./ Protestant-
ism with them was. uncompromiding and
direct;, concerned with precepts and
every-day actualities, and the symbolism
and idealism of Catholic countries had no
part in It. Their churches were never
adorned. No mysteries of religion were
portrayed on the walls They reserved
mural decorations for their town halls and
public buildings, and when some man
went so far as to want a Holy Family
the wife of a prosperous burgomaster, in
puffed sleeves and big petticoats, was con
sidered as good a Madonna as one who
sat on clouds and looked down.
There are great galleries in Holland In
which the greatest works of the Â«reat
Dutch masters are grouped. These are at
Amsterdam, The Hague and Rotterdam.
But the student should not miss the town
hall at Haarlem, where the most Import
ant works of Franz Hals are to be found.
The work of two menâ Rembrandt and
Franz Hals, the two greatest of Dutch
masters-la famous the world over. In a
lesser degree, though still as recognized
masters, are Van der Heist. Jan Steen.
Ruysdael, Wouverman, Van Ostade. Paul
Potter and Cuyp, each affecting not only
the art of their time but that of Europe.
They are all represented In the three gal
leries Just named, and the young artist
In -his tour through them might easily
content himself with a study of these
alone There are scores of other paint
ersâDutch and Flemishâ to be seen whose
names make only the impression of un
pronounceableness and whose works only
add to the general confusion. Still-life
painters, with pots and kettles and cab
bages, and marine painters, with Dutrh
luggers built like their vrou.Â«. interiors
with spots of light from a window, the
rest a grimy canvas; stable yards, with
imitations of Wouvermanâ a white horse
in a distant stretch of country. Several
foreign artists, such as Rubens, Murillo
and others, are also represented.
The student, of course. If he chooses,
may look at them all. or he may if he
like adopt my wayâ walk down the acre
age of canvas until some one picture calls
to him to stopâ then stand still and listen.
Rembrandt will always call him to stop,
no matter how small the head or unim
portant apparently the canvas. If one
must believe all that biographers have
disagreed In declaring for this supreme
master who was born at Leyden on July
5 1607, we should have to believe not only
that he had been born rich, but that he
had been born poor; that his parents had
been respectable, and that they had been
paupers; that he had been a roisterer, and
again that he had been r reputable . citi
zen, the friend of magistrates and govern
ors. But we do know that he was des
tined for the law. and that, like many an
other genius, he Insisted upon deciding for
himself, and so became a. painter. He
studied under many masters, but was his
own greatest teacher. He lived at Am
sterdam, having married Saskla van Ulen
burch. Rembrandt's portraits " of this
wife are famous for their beauty of tech-

Frankle White, who by a decision
of the Supreme' Court yesterday

Fifteen years ago White became
tired of his wife and endeavored
to get rid of her by the process 6t

complaint, in which was set forth
many accusations of cruelty, etc.
The trial court decided that the
woman's story was the true one
and she was given the divorce. J '

mony, counsel fees, etc. , In order 5
to make the decree more binding it
was recorded In Humboldt. Trinity
and Mendocino counties and White
was enjoined from disposing of his
property. The cattle king laughed
at the court and soon after leased
a considerable portion of the land
to his nephew, J. S.: Rohrbough.
Both were punished for -contempt
of court. In order to secure her
dues Mrs. White requested the
court to appoint a receiver to sell
the land, which was done. Mrs.

. Sir Robert Flnlay, the new Attorney
General, like most counsel with a largo
practice, knows what it 13 to receive a
disconcerting reply from an apparently
guileless witness and tells a good story
against himself in illustration. He was
engaged on a case of breach of warranty
of a horse, the age of the animal being tho
chief matter in dispute, and had to cross
examine a hostler, a yokel with every
appearance of simplicity. "Upon what au
thority do you swear to the age of the
mare?" he asked. "I'm sure of It," was
the reply. Half a dozen more questions
failed to elicit from the witness any more
specific answer. "But how do yon
know?" thundered Sir Robert at last. "I
had it from the mare'3 own mouth!" re
plied the hostlerâ London Chronicle.
From th<s Mare's Month.

SEVENTY YEARS OF AGE
AND STILL A CRIMINAL
A good story Is told of how a few years
ago a reckless, careless but brilliant
Scotch journalist got a position on the
London Dally Telegraph. For some esca
pade in Edinburgh he had lost his place
on a paper there. He had scarcely a
penny in his pocket, so, although he felt
himself not at his, best mentally, he went
off at once to Fleet street and asked the
editor of the Telegraph for work. "What
can you do?" asked the editor. And the
applicant, feeling he must make a tremen
dous bid. replied, "Anything."
"Anything?" :
"Yes. Anything."
"Very well. I think probably you're tho
man wo ttant. I will leave you quite
alone for a half hour, then I will come
back, and you must have an article
ready."
"On what?" asked the Scotchman. : . V
"On anything." answered the editor.
For five minutes the young man sat de
spairing. He didn't seem to nave even th*Â»
ehost of an Idea In his head. Finally an
impudent inspiration came. Around the
room were files of the Telegraph. Ho
pulled one out, about eight years old. and
hurriedly turning the leaves came to an
article by George Augustus Sala. on Lon
don streets. Seizing copy paper and a pen
he raced the clock, and Jammed the file
back into place only a minute before tho
grave editor returned. This gentleman
looked over the article which the Edin
burgh man had "just dashed off" and
saidr "I think I can find a place for you,
sir. You seem to catch our style."âSat
urday Evening Post.
Easy Style to Catch.

Nothing daunted, Mr. Morosco last

by the Princess Claudia Valerian to warn,
against projected police raids, the band of
Nihilistic conspirators of whom hÂ«r
brother is : chief. .:Demetrius, Chief of
Police, suspects her design and haa- the
lamp removed, and the Princess then goes
In person to warn her brother and his
friends and is discovered in their society
by the omniscient Demetrius. From this
suspicious situation she is /extrfcated by
the quick wit of her friend, Allah Villiers,
an. American journalist (really, a Credit to
our craft), :who, by the clever trick of a
bogus letter.'turna the tables on the Chief
of 'Police (here the audience becomes en

glow with, conscious pride).> But though
nearly all newspaper menare good, a few
-a very few-^are bad, among: these bad
(in "The Ked Lamp") is an editor named
Ivan y.azaulie (perhaps his name led him
astray). Through the treachery of this
wrÂ«?tch : Creally Â¦ a discredit to- our craft),
the Nihilists' plot is revealed and the

The action of the play In the first and

It Is stated that the Russian Govern
ment is proposing to effect an alteration
in its calendar, the dates in which, since
the end of last February, have differed
thirteen days from those of. "Western
Europe and America; We are, however,
told they do not propose to adopt the
Gregorian reckoning, but to bring Into usÂ»
a scheme more simple and accurate, and
to Invite other nations to accept this. It
is then to be presumed that the plan In
question is that of dropping a leap year
regularly each one hundred and twenty
eighth year, which would keep the calen
dar right and In accordance with the true
length of the tropical year for SO.00O year*.
Obviously this is far more simple than the
Greerorian rule, which Is this: -Â¦ v .-â¢'â¢Â¦Â¦:
Drop a leap year in each year the num
ber of which is divisible bv 100. unless It
is also divisible by *X>. This would keep
the calendar right for over 3000 vears. but
If It were further modified by dropping a
lean year In each year the number of
which Is divisible by 4000 it would pre
serve the year In accordance with ita trnÂ»
length for 100.000 years. So that the modi
fled Gregorian rule, with an exception of
an exception of an exception, would- bo
scarcely more accurate than the abovo
simple rule, according to which the next
leap year dropped, after the* present one,
would be 2028. To prove its accuracy It 13
only necessary to point out that It implies
having, in- every period of 128 year?,
ninety-seven common years of 363 day*
each, and thirty-seven bissextile yea rÂ»
of 366 days each. Thla makes In all

Judpe Hall. sat to-day in Judge Greene's

the matters in the contest, feeling dls
qualltled because his brother-in-law^ A.
A. Moore, Is: one of the persons attacked
by Phllbrook. The hearing was continued
until August 24.
"He is informed and believes, and there
fore avers, that the said Phllbrook Is fin
ancially irresponsible and insolvent, and
that the said Philbrook by reason of un
soundness of mind and infirmity of tem
per Is incapable of properly performing
the duties of a guardian of the person or
estate of any person. The said Phllbrook
in presenting his said petition to be ap
pointed guardian is not seeking to pro
mote the interests of the said James- P.
Merritt, but is maliciously and vindictive

money from him." . . ; - .'Â¦ : ..''Â¦
The answer further states that Phll
brook has threatened to sue Merritt for
attorney's fees,' and should not be ap
pointed guardian for this further reason.

control of any person or that his prop
erty is in danger of being despoiled. . '

Phllbrook seeks a guardianship., allege

clare that the three children of Frederick
Merritt have no interest In any property
whatever, and that the only Interest pos
sessed by the two children of James P.
Merritt is. the beneficiary one which they
have under, a trust deed, held by George

The actions of all parties in the Knowles
trust case are related at length to show
that the Interests of. the minors were
properly cared for. The Merrltts are will

order to determine the interest of the
minors in the Knowles trust property.- .
Philbrook Is described as "of an exceed

lately sought tobe employed by James P.

By mutual consent the boy arranged a
meeting a short time ago between his
parents. A few later Interviews settled
the difficulty. To-day the youth escorted
them to Oakland with a friend. The mar
riage license was procured and Justice
John Stetson performed the ceremony
with the boy as witness. The Boehnkes
will reside on Twenty-third street. San
Francisco.
The lad was old enough to fully realize
the position of his-parents. He had ample
evidence of the love they bore toward
him. He decided to use his endeavors to
bring his father and mother together
again, and success has crowned his ef
forts. :
The story is one of a simple German
couple, middle-aged and for years happily
w.edded. In time, however, little domestic
difficulties arose, and a breach was cre
ated in the family.. Perhaps both were to
blame, but whatever the reason. Mrs.
Boehnke at last resorted to the divorce
court. In 1S9S she was legally separated
from her spouse. The custody of the boy
was so arranged that both parents had
ample opportunity to see him. It was this
arrangement which to-day led to the
happy termination of their domestic
troubles. : : Â¦
Because of their affection for a 15-year
old son^ Arthur E. Boehnke and Caroline
Boehnke of San Francisco, who have
been divorced for two years, were reunited
in marriage to-day, and the cause of the
reunion, Arthur Boehnke, was one of the
witnesses to the ceremony which made
his parents again husband and wife.

Mr. Spear, "I found the business men and

convinced of the fact that it was good

ed to carry his own State, but Omaha tho
biggest city in his State, will not support
him, for it is a 'McKinley and prosperity'
town throughout, . .7 Â¦ . .'
"The warcry of Mr.' Bryan does not ap

early date, has every appearance that it
will result more disastrously to the Demo

The. new turn of affairs caused by the
decision of the Supreme Court declaring

hpHE authorities at "Washington ought
I to be informed that John C. Lynch,
H Collector of Internal Revenue for
this district, is "neglecting his duties
as a Federal onlce holder and offensively
intruding himself in political â¢ affaira.
There is eo much danger that Lynch's
offensive conduct will, endanger Republi
can: success in one of the Congressional
districts of California that Chairman
George Stone ought to suggest to the head
of the department in Washington that the
obnoxious Collector be promptly advised
to attend to the duties of his office and
permit the State, and Congressional com
mittees to manage the campaign in Cali
Â¦ f ornia. . . : â¢
â¢ : Lynch is going about In a self-important
way,' talking of what "we have decided,"
and. what combinations "we have made."
When closely pressed for information as
to Inside details- lie 'intimates that "we"
means himself. Herrin and Burns. The
other day he told a Democrat who is well
known in this city that "we" had decided
to nominate. Woods ;of Stockton for Con
gress in the Second iDistrlct in place of
Forbes. He remarked further, "We talk
of giving the Democratic nomination to
Caminetti instead of Sproul."
.Talks of the Combination.
Lynch is fond of approaching Republi
can County Committeemen of San-Fran
cisco and telling them that they ought to
pet into "the. combination," which will in
elude Kelly and Crimmins. He-gives out
the word that the Mint saloon bosses are
not the chief factors, but that they will
be taken care of and recognllzed.
This man Lynch is paid by the Govern
ment to supervise the collection of inter
nal revenue of this district. If he gave
proper attention to the duties of his posi
tion he would have no time to blather
about the affairs of the Second Congres
sional District- and circulate the report
that Colcnel Forbes was not acceptable
to the "combination."
The Republicans expect to .carry the
State for McKinley and Roosevelt by the
largest majority ever recorded in Califor
nia. They are hopeful of electing a full
Republican delegation to Congress. One
office-holding blatherskite and railroad
tool like Lynch' might do the party a great
deal of harm, hence ho should be called
down and suppressed.

finished his testimony Rumble told the
whole inside working of the scheme.
He said he had known Valentine in
Butte, Mont. He said he met him there
Â°? i*" 1 "?^' 4 last on the sidewalk in front
of his place in Butte, and this conversa
tion took place between them:
/"Hello, Val."
"Hello, Humble."
"What are you doing now?"
"Oh, the same old game."
"Making any moneyP"
"You bet."
"What are you makingP Is it as
good as during the old times at
Platt's HallP"
"Well, I am making between
$3000 and $10,000 a month."
"How do you manage to run it?"
"Oh, I have to sugar up pretty
well."
"What percentage?"
"Twenty-five to a man named
Crimmins, -who is taking care of me."
Witness continued that the ' game car
ried on by Valentine was known as the
"tape" game, but it used to be called the
"clock" game.
He was then excused and his cross-ex
amination was deferred till this afternoon,
when the trial will be resumed.
Valentine and Rumble were formerly in
partnership In this city In a "clock" game.
They conducted their business In Platfs
Hall on Montgomery street, and it was
raided by the police in 1888. After that
they 'dissolved partnership and Rumble
started a "game" on Market street, near
Fifth. His place was also raided by the
police about seven years ago, which put
a quietus on the "game" for several years.
Phil Crimmins declares he knows noth
ing- about any protection afforded to the
bucket shops. He says he knows Valen
tine, but he has never met Rumble; that
he does not know him, and that he never
had anything to do with him.
"I never got a cent out of them," he
said last evening, "and I don't see how
this story came out. I don't know this
man Rumble, and I don't believe Valen
tine ever told him he was being protected.
Anyway, I have had nothing to do with
the business, and that's straight."
