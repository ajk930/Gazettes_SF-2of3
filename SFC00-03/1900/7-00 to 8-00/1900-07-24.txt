RUSSIAN PARTY IN MANCHURIA SURROUNDED.
L! SUSPECTED OF DOUBLE DEALING.
In a private message from Shanghai it is asserted that Li Hung Chang avows that the object of his journey is to place
the regular Chinese army in line with the allied troops for the suppression of the Boxers.
The Times, editorially, suggests that Li Hung Chang is playing the old game of the Sublime Porte by putting forward
proposals which will appear in different degrees and ways to different powers. It says:
"President McKinley has been asked to mediate, and the request is facilitated by the care which has been taken in Wash
ington not to commit the United States to any very thoroughgoing policy."
Indian troops are daily arriving at Hongkong. Three transports reached there yesterday; two others have left Hong
kong for Taku.
Reports from Canton say the city is outwardly quiet, but that there is a strong undercurrent of unrest among the Chi
nese. Only a few European ladies have left, many still remaining.
'We want no conquests," tie is reported to have declared at the conclusion of a sitting of the Council. "What we desire is
to protect our frontiers and to steer into smooth waters the Chinese ship of state, now buffeted by the waves of civil war."
There is nothing further this morning that throws any light upon the mysterious situation. Two urgent dispatches were
addressed yesterday by the Chinese Minister to the Peking Government and the Administrator of Telegraphic Communication,
stronglv recommending the restoration of telegraphic communication so as to enable the powers to learn of the safety of the foreign
Minister. Until such proofs are secured no one here is inclined to alter the opinion that the Chinese are merely juggling to gain
time. â¢
Rumor circulates briskly around the personality of Li Hung Chang. He is credited with a mission to offer to cede
to the allied powers two province's as indemnity for the Peking outrages, and also to offer to restore order and give facilities for
trade with the outside world on condition of the surrender of Kiaochau, Wei Hai Wei and Manchuria by the powers, and the
withdrawal of all missionaries. Little attention, however, need be paid to any of these rumors.
CZAR DECLARES RUSSIA WANTS NO CONQUEST.
/3OXDOX, July 24, 4 a. m.â The Shanghai correspondent of the Daily Mail, telegraphing July 23, says:
I " \ letter from a Chinese official at Shantung has been received by an active functionary here, containing the following
Â°* B^ passage: 'At the beginning of the month the foreign Ministers made several attempts to send messages out of Peking, but
thanks to the strict watch kept on the city, the bearers were all caught and executed. On the 4th inst. only 400 foreigners,
much exhausted, were left alive in Peking/and one night, when the big guns were incessantly .fired, it was known that all the , lega
tions and foreigners were finished, although pretended telegrams contradicted these facts.' "
The St. Petersburg correspondent of the Daily Mail asserts that there are differences of opinion in the Russian Council
of War. The Minister of \Var,.General Kouopatkin, wishes to send 100,000 men to clear the rebels out of Manchuria. On the other
hand according to this correspondent, Emperor Nicholas wishes the operations limited to the defense and pacification of the
frontier districts. Let two strong armies, one of the allies in the south and the other of the Russians in the north, confront the Chi
nese, and the rising â so the Czar is said to argue â would be bound to collapse.

SHANGHAI, via Teheran, July 23. â Li Hung Chang sent yesterday messages to the Empress Dowager requesting her
to settle quickly on the suppression of the Boxers, if that was her intention, and stating that he had insufficient forces to get to Pe
king, n he had to force his way. He telegraphed the Governor of the Grand Canal to prepare the route for him, as he was not
\ going via Taku. He telegraphed the Japanese Emperdr, saying:
"Our countries are too closely connected to go to war. You must find means to assist us. If China is ruined you will be
lost. We beg you not to send more troops. Ask the other powers to bring the affair to a close. Ask the other powers' intentions.
Act as mediator. Find a method of securing peace. If any answer keep secret.'' 7

St. Petersburg dispatches represent the situation in Manchuria as far more serious than had been supposed. It is asserted
that the Chinese have occupied Hailar, where the Russian railway staff is surrounded and in desperate straits.
According to the St. Petersburg correspondent of the Times the Russian Minister of War probably will become cora

WASHINGTON. July 23.â Th<Â» Staje

lowing: Th<> Stare Department has
received a dispatch from Mr.
Goodnow, the Consul Genaral at Shang

Li Yamen saw all Ihe Ministers on the
ISth; that none Â»prc injured, and that no

does not Fay to whom the dispatch of
Prince Tuan was addressed, and it is to
a certain extent at variance with the dis
patch of Mr. Conger of that date, describ
ing the legation as being under fire at that
time. '*Â¦Â¦â¢ â¢
After mature consideration the officials
of the State Department have come to the
conclusion that by a telegraphic error the
r.ame of the informant of Consul General
CJoodnow has been turned into "Tuan"
from "Yuan." The latter is the famous
Yuan Shih Kai. the Governor of the prov
ince of Shantung. He always has main
tained an attitude of neutrality and ever
leaned toward positive friendship for the
l<>re!gners. He has from the first divided
with Shong. the director of posts and tele
graph? at Shanghai, the distinction of be
ing the only means of communication be
tween Peking and the outside world
Therefore, it is extremely probable that
he has served in the same capacity in this
instance.
On the other hand, if this dispatch rcal
lv came from Prince Tuan, the fact would
b* ot great significance. In the opinion
of the officials hÂ«re. it would indicate that
this official either has been grossly mis
represented as to his anti-foreign ten
dency, or that he is seeking to escape re
sponsibility for the outrages upon foreign
ers, an act in itself significant of the
breaking of the anti-foreign party, with
tach principal looking: out for himself.

BOSTON, July 23â The American Board

which he says the Boxer movement has
reached a climax. Murder and arson are
lining the province from Kalgan to Lin

assembled*:
"At the last or the month," he writes,
"the word came down from the thone for
the Boxers to 'create disorder' as rapidly
as possible. After the trains stopped fran
tic appeals came for protection to the
Ministers. Last Saturday night the va
rious Consuls here had a stormy meeting
until midnight. The French and Rus

ing troops to repair the road and to re
lieve Peking. They withdrew for con
sultation several times. Consul Carts
(British) held steadily for? that action,
backed by the American and Japanese
Consuls. Finally Captain McCalla said:
'We have talked a good deal; now I will
tell you what I will do. Our Minister
telegraphs that he Is In danger. It mat
ters not what others do or do not, do. My
entire force of \bluejacketsâ 100â will take

Place No Faith in Chinese
"Edicts" Reporting Safety
01 LGjjdllOlloi
LONDON. Juty 23.â In the House of
Commons to-day the Parliamen
tary Secretary of Foreign Affairs,
William St. John Broderick. com
municated certain statements of
the Chinese authorities with regard to the
legations at Peking, and said the Minister
believed them to be unharmed.
Mr. Broderick read the text of the sev
eral edicts of July IS, commenting on Min
ister Conger's dispatch to the Department
of State of the United States, and said
that though the dispatch was the same
date as the edict of assurance of safety,
the latter was not borne out by Mr. Con
ger. Consul Warren has telegraphed to
the Governor of Shantung to know how
a message from Peking reached him in
two days, and why there was no message
from their Foreign Minister, Sir Claude
Macdonald. The Governor has replied
that the United States Minister's message
was sent by the Tsung-Lt-Yamen by a
messenger traveling (500 leagues (roughly
200 miles) a day.
"I assure you." the Governor of Shan
tung had added, "there is no telegraphic
communication. I cannot explain why
Masdonald.has not telegraphed, but I beg
you not to get anxious about the Minis
ters, for they and the others are all living
and unharmed. Of this I have already
had several reliable messages."
Mr. Broderick continued: "Seeing that
over a month has elapsed since any com
munication has reached the Government
from the 'British legation, and the Tsung-
Ll- Yamen is communicating by messenger
with various Chinese authorities, her Ma
jesty's Government feels it cannot give
credence to any statement or to any de
crees attributed to the officials of the Chi
nese Government until they are fortified
by letters signed and dated by Sir Claude
Macdonald. or by other officials or by
some cablegram in our cipher." â¢
According to the translation'read by Mr.
Broderick, the Imperial edict opens as fol.
lows:
"In the Confucian philosophy, spring
and autumn, it Is written Envoys should
not be killed. How, then, can it be sup
posed the. throne's policy is to connive at
allowing troops and people to vent their
wrath on foreign Ministers?"
The edict then gives the assurance al
ready made known to the public.
In the House of Commons the Secretary
of State for India, Lord George Hamilton,
announced that the Maharajah of Wal
hir had offered the Government a fully
equipped hospital ship, upon which it is
proposed to spend twenty lakhs of rupees,
for service In China, as a mark of loyalty
to the Queen. The offer was accepted.
Lord George Hamilton also testified to
the Government's appreciation of those
who are sending: the Maine to China.

AMERICAN ATTITUDE
DISPLEASES GERMANY
BERLTN. July 23.â Disappointment is
experienced in official circles at the tenor
of the reports from Washington regarding
America's policy. On this point the Ber
liner Tageblatt, with evident inspiration,
says:
"The Chinese have nearly succeeded in
creating differences of opinion among the
powers. The Government of the United
States seems determined thus early to
occupy a separate standpoint with the
concert of the powers. As at Taku,
where the American admiral would not
join, so now President McKlnley ap
parently means to oppose the joint action
of the powers aimed at the re-establish
ment of order in China, all of . which
proves that ihe Chinese are Indeed the
most cunning diplomatists In the world.
While most of the papers point out the
impossibility of an advance upon Peking,
because of the smallness of the allied
forces, as against a greatly superior force
âbecause of the disastrous effect which
a possible defeat would have upon the
whole cf China, and also because of the
rainy seasonâ the National. Zeitung con
tends that there is but one way to ascer
tain the truth or untruth of the Chinese
claim that the legations are safe, namely,
an immediate advance on the capital.
The semi-official Berliner Post points
out that Germany must send a number or
warships to the Yang-tse Kiang to pro
tect the German commercial Interests in
Shangal and Hankow.

GEEMAN FORCE REDUCED.
BERLIN. July 23.â A dispatch from
Taku. dated Friday, July 20, says the
German force at Tientsin has been re
duced to 200 men/
BY the steamship America Maru,
which arrived from the Orient yes
terday, there were received papers
giving Admiral Seymour's report of
his advance toward Peking and
subsequent retreat to Tientsin. The pub
lication of the report gives the lie to the
fake story to the 'effect that, to save them
frowi torture by the Boxers, all of the
wounded of the relief column were shot
by Seymour's order at the request of the
unfortunates. On the contrary, all of the
wounded were safely brought out.
The report is subjoined. It bears the
date June 23 and ia as follows:
"During our advance from Tientsin to
Langfang we were repeatedly rttacked
by the Boxers, but we beat them back,
inflicting; heavy loss and not suffering any
casualties ourselves. When we reached
Langfang a large force of the enemy at
tacked us fiercely, using artillery as well
as rifles, but we defeated them, killing
about one hundred, and having five Ital
ians wounded on our own side. On the
same day the force guarding Lohfah sta
tion was vehemently attacked, but we
dispatched reinforcements and the enemy
were defeated with a loss of 100. On our
side the casualties were two British ma
rines wounded.

we were again attacked, and again de-

as soon as we appeared on the banks oÂ£

opened a hot fire on us with rifl>?s ami

"The fire of our advance guard checked
them somewhat, and Major Johr.stonea

afterward the German detachment on tho
bank of the river silenced two of the en

these guns. We finally obtained com
plete possession of the stores. Several
times on that day and during the suc
ceeding days the enemy tried to recover
the position, but failed. In the stores w*
found a quantity of rice and other graht
which served for provisions, and we als<*
captured a number of new pattern guns
as well as a quantity of ammunition.
"We were able to use some of the guns
at once for the purpose of attacking a,
Chinese fort at a point farther down tha
river. The rice and grain enabled us to
hold out for several days, but we wero
much embarrassed by our wounded. X

feated our assailants, inflicting on them
a loss of 173. We then found that the
railway in front of us was hopelessly
damaged and that its repair would be out
pf the question with the means at our
command. I therefore decided to return
to Yangtsun for the purpose of taking the
river route from that place. When vacat
ing Langfang we left two trains with a
strong guard, which were to follow us.
They were attacked by an army of Boxers
and Chinese regulars, who were defeated
after a severe contest, their casualties
amounting to from 400 to .=tt>0 and our own
being 6 killed and IS wounded.
"At Yangtsun we were joined by three
trains, hut they had been so much injured
as to be unfit for further service. We
were also in straits for provisions, and
our wounded hampered us greatly. I
therefore determined to fall back upon
Tientsin. Our communications with that
place had been severed for six days, and
not only were we without proper appli
ances for the wounded but also no means
existed of obtaining food.

"It was deemed best to put the wounded

FLIGHT OF EUROPEANS
FROM BOXER FANATICS
ADMIRAL SEYMOUR'S WOUNDED
REACHED TIENTSIN IN SAFETY
WASHINGTON', July 23. â The
President has listened to the
appeal of the Chinese Govern
ment, as transmitted through
Minister WjJ. and has signified
his willingness to mediate between the
imperial government and the powers, but
only upon conditions which first must be
mot by the Chinese Government.
The exact nature of the terms proposed
by the State Department cannot be stated
until to-morrow, when it Is expected that
publication will be made of the text of
the Chineso appeal and of the President's
message. It is known, however, that the
answer is entirely consistent with the
statement of principles laid down by Sec
retary Hay in his identical note to the
powers, and, moreover, it accepts as
truthful the Chinese statement relative to
the safety ' of the foreign Ministers at
Peking.
It would not, of course, be possible to
take initial step's toward mediation were
either party to the negotiations to enter
tain open distrust of the accuracy of the
statements of the other. There must be
confidence between them. The United
States answer does not go to the length
of the French answer to a similar appli
cation in laying down conditions which
the Chinese Government could not meet,
even if so disposed, if it actually is strug
gling for its own existence. It does, how
ever, look to the immediate relief of for
eigners in Peking, and, moreover, to the
protection of all foreigners, missionaries
and traders -in China, and to the restora
tion of order. With this much accom
plished the State Department feels that it
can properly approach the powers with
the Chinese proposition for a settlement
for what has occurred.
The Chinese appeal came to Secretary
Hay yesterday through Minister Wu. The
Secretary promptly telegraphed it to the
President at Canton, and after taking a
full day for lts # con?ideratlon the Presi
dent's answer came to-day. It was put in
the proper diplomatic form and a copy
delivered to Minister Wu. who- is to for
ward it to his own government. The ap
peal and answer will be made public here
The imperial edict made public to-day at
the State Department chows that the im
perial government already has taken the
first steps toward doing what the Inited
States Government requires as the princi
pal condition for the exercise of its good
offices In enjoining the viceroys, magis
trates and leading men to stop the dis
orders and protect foreigners, and our
Government will await the results; of this
before proceeding further. It Is expected
that adverse criticism upon the action of
the State Department in this matter will
be heard from Europe, where the govern
ments are acting upon the belief that all
the foreigners in Peking have perished,
but our Government nevertheless regards
its course as the correct one.
All the European governments have
taken the stand here Indicated. The last
of the answers to Secretary Hay s note
reciting the Conger message have come.
and all of them, in terms polite and di
plomatic, express utter incredulity In the
authenticity of the Conger message, con
sul General Goodnow. himself a man or
good judgment, 'also cabled a warning to
Secretary Hay against the acceptance of
the message without confirmation. But
th> State Department has fully considered
the message in all its aspects, has care
fully weighed the numerous objections
and suspicions put forth here hnd in
Europe, and. without" guaranteeing the
authenticity of the message, feels it to be
a matter of prime duty to act upon the
theory that it is genuine.
Admiral Remey's notification to the de
partment that he had gone in person up
the Peiho from Taku to Tientsin is at
tributed to the receipt by him of Secretary
LonK's urgent message to hasten the ef
forts to get to Peking. anÂ«f important
news from him is expected soon.
The Goodnow cablegram reciting tne
message from Prince Tuan vouching for
the safety of the foreign Ministers on
July IS caused a ripple of excitement for
a time at the State Department, but the
officials soon concluded from the context
and other circumstances surrounding the
message that Yuan was meant nstead'ot
Tuan. so that the message lost the \alue
it would have had if it had come ffom the
redoubtable Boxer leader.
THE FIRST FIGHTâ SEYMOUR'S MEN BATTLING WITH BOXERS ON THE MARCH TO PEKING.
At Langfang. hetween Tientsin and Peking, on June 16. sixteen British bluejackets from the Centurion, under
Major Johnston, who were in the advance, -were attacked by some 3000 Chinese troops and Boxers. They held them
ofr with sharp Maxim and rifle fire until relieved by parties of Americans and Germans, with whose aid the enemy were
soon put to flight.

Before Dulce came I had seen many of
his kind die agonizing and, I know now.
unnecessary deaths, not from climate, but
from bread and milk. But Dulce came
to teach me how to keep his race in
health, beauty and happiness. His first
object lesson was to pounce "upon a box
where I kept weevils or mealworms for
my mocking bird and make away with a
dozen or more at a slttinq;. In this way
he told me that the marmoset is insectiv
orous. Mealworms may be had all win
ter from bird dealers, as well as live
bait from the fish market; but when sum
mer comes Dulce and I go on grasshop
per hunts, and such sport as we have
chasing them about In the warm Krass
and ferreting under stones in cool places
for crickets! In June, when Dulce is sound
asleepâ for he snoozes from 5 o'clock in
the afternoon till 10 th<Â» next morningâ
I go out in search of the brown beetles
that fall under the electric light. Eggs,
both raw and hard-boiled," cooked lob
rter and paper-shelled clams are all capi
tal s-ubstltutes for the summer Insects. It
is now six years since I found my little
companion, and to-day he is as active
and as strong as a Shetland pony.â The
Century. *
I went close to his cage, and, to my joy!
instead of shrinking from me in agitated
aversion, as all the others had done, he
came to meet me. I opened the door,
and before I knew it he was on my shoul
der and, with one of his white rosettes
pressed against my cheek, singing the
tenrlerest and sweetest little song, which
told me that I was his and he was mine.
I took him home, and because he was so
sweet in disposition I called him Dulce.
When I first saw Dulce he was trying
to make the best of things In a grimy cor
ner of the shop of a dealer in animals.
He had that very day come from his
tropical home, and I wondered if the
hands that had decorated his ears with
ornaments of coral and tinsel were hands
that had loved him. and if so, how they
could ever let him go, a being so beau
tiful. No silk was ever softer than his
fur. through the gray of which I caught
shades of orange and black. His . eyes
were sparks of electric light, struck from
the white tufts of hair on each side of
the face that scrutinized me so critically.
Dulce is a gentleman of the old school,
fastidious, alert and valiant. Vehement
in his likes and dislikes, and quick to rec
ognize the good and the bad, he acts as
my divining rod. I know when Dulce
sings softly upon first acquaintance that
here is a person to trust, but when he
goes off In a succession of short clicks,
like a policeman's rattle, I am on my
guard. â¢
What is a marmoset? you will ask. The
books of natural history will tell you that
they are the smallest of the monkey tribe;
but when I hear them singing like a
tnlcketful of thrushes, as I do when they
are quite content, then I say they are
birds: again, when I see them Jump about
my room as light as puffs of smoke. I
say they are spirits; and yet again, when
I look into their faces and see the expres
sion there, 1 half human, half elflike, I
say they are hobgoblins.
I have been under the spell of these be
witching little things for many a year,
and to-day I am no nearer knowing what
they really are than I was at first. Even
Dulce, who 'is the head of the family of
which I am going to tell you, keeps up
the mystery of his identity. Dulce comes
from Colombia, South America, but ho
goes wherever I go, in winter in a fur
lined basket and in summer on my shoul
der.

cation from Secretary of State John Hay,
inclofing an extended letter from N. Na
beshima, the Japanese Charge d'Affalres
at Washington. The latter's letter is In the
nature of a demand upon the part of the
Imperial Government of Japan that the
Colorado State Board of Health raise the
quarantine on Japanese subjects.
The Japanese, according to the Charge's
statement, should not be included with
the Chinese in anything. He says they
are not given to plague and never have
been; that the suggestion of the Colorado
Beard of Health to such a fact is rather
an exhibition of Ignorance than a mani
fest understanding of prevailing. race con
ditions. The Japanese, he maintains, do
not mix with the Chinese in any part of
the world.
In concluding, he states very plainly
that the- Imperial Government of Japan
will insist that the race shall not be dis
criminated against.
Governor Thomas will confer further
with the State Board of Health in regard
to the quarantine which is still effective
In this State against Asiatics.

"The situation in the Philippines is just
what it was during the last years of the
Spanish rule." said Captain F. V. Krug
of the Twenty-second Infantry, who has
jijst returned from eighteen months of
campaigning in the Philippines and is
staying at the Occidental. "The best peo
ple â the educated classes â have become
convinced that the American rule is the
best they could possibly have, and the
fighting is all being done by roving bands
of robbers who have harassed the Islands
for many years and levied tribute on their
more fortunate neighbors and tribal ene
mies. Practically all of Manila and the
immediate districts in that vicinity are
at peace with us and the people are anx
ious to see the war ended. They are only
prevented from openly joining the Ameri
can cause by agents of the robber bands
who manage to creep through the lines
and intimidate them by threats to burn
down their houses and places of business
and to murder them in the night. Too
often these threats are carried out.
Captain Krug speaks with some authori
ty, for. in addition to campaigning pretty
well over the Island of Luzon, he nas had
the command for several months of the
provost guard in charge of one of the
largest and most thickly populated dis
tricts of Manila. He has had to deal with
all classes of the Filipinos and has learn
ed their characteristics. Just now he is
on two months" sick leave and is making
a round trip on the transport HancocK
to recuperate.
"One of the curious things we have to
deal with," he continued, "is to keep our
prisons from being overcrowded with
voluntary prisoners. All prisoners of war
are kept in a closely guarded section of
the town, where they have plenty of
room to rove about and plenty of fresh
air. In spite of all we can do to keep
them out. the number of prisoners in
creases daily. The only way that I can
account for it is that the poor fellows
find better living in the prisons than the>
can possibly get outside. \N e feed them
the regular army ration, which consists
of frozen beef, hard bread and vegetables.
The beef cannot be secured outside at any
price, even by the wealthy.
"Under such treatment the Filipinos
are becoming altogether too fastidious.
On one occasion, while I was superintend
ing the distribution of the ration, instead
of beef the commissary had chanced to
send mutton, thinking, perhaps, that the
prisoners would enjoy the change of diet.
Instead they refused absolutely to accept
the mutton, and went without meat
rather than accept It. It was not until
some days later that I learned the real
reason for their refusal; they thought the
frozen sheep were dogs. While they were
willing to eat dogs before the Americans
came, they prefer beef now.
"The policy of leniency pursued by Gen
eral Otis is bearing good fruit now. In
nearly every case spies, murderers and
other desperate criminals who have been
convicted by military courts and sen
tenced to death, have had their sentences
commuted to imprisonment by the re
viewing authority. I understand that
these prisoners are to be brought to tht*
country, to serve out their terms In mil
itary prisons here."

Mrs. Duke is the daughter of Count Al
fred Festetics of Austria, and is first
cousin of Count Festetics, who married
Ella Haggin, daughter of the California
millionaire. Her husband, who died six
years ago. was a graduate of Columbia
College and was at the time of his death
a rapidly rising attorney practicing at
the New York bar. Mrs. Duke is now
about 28 years old, of handsome figure
and intelligent face. Since the death of
her husband she has almost entirely sup
ported herself by painting.
With Mrs. Redstone, Mrs. Duke has
been living at No. 4 West Eighteenth
street. The former loaned Mrs. Duke a
valuable lorgnette, which she was later
unable to recover. Mrs. Duke at first de
nied any knowledge of the trinket, but
when threatened with arrest she said she
had lost it.
She promised to replace it and begged
her friend not to disgrace her. Mrs. Red
stone in a moment of anger turned the
matter over to the police and then for
two days tried to undo her hasty action.
It was made apparent that the case to
day was the outgrowth of a quarrel and
Mrs. Redstone seemed even more anxious
to withdraw the complaint than her one
time friend was to have her do so. Mag
istrate Meade quickly settled the affair
by ordering the discharge of Countess
Festetics on the ground that no crime
had been committed.
NEW YORK, July 23.â Two young
women, each of attractive personality,
made a pathetic picture in the Jefferson
Market Court this afternoon. One, Count
ess Festetics, known in this city as Mrs.
Annie N. Duke, was a prisoner charged
with larceny of a valuable lorgnette. The
complainant was Mrs. Dora Redstone,
until recently the warmest personal
friend of the Countess.

"I considered their representations of
little Importance." said the admiral, "and
did not take them to Manila. Later I
gave permission to Aguinaldo and about
a dozen others to come to Manila. All
that they were anxious about at that time
was an end of the tyranny of Spain,
against which they were lighting. After
the destruction of Montejo's fleet the city
virtually surrendered, and I am satisfied
that if we had had 5000 troops there at that
time we could have gone ashore and been
received by the Filipinos as deliverers.
They had absolutely no thought then of
independence. That was an after-thought
of their leaders during the interim be
tween the smashing of the Spanish lieet
and the arrival of the United States
troops."
Speaking of the report that Cuba was
to be evacuated by the American troops
after the holding of the constitutional
convention. Admiral Dewey said he did
not see how the United States could turn

the orderly conduct of affairs in Cuba,"
said he, "and until such a government is
established I cannot see how we can with
draw We are confronted with a similar
situation in the Philippines. The world
looks to us, and no matter what political
party wins in November, the United

a responsible and stable government is
set up there." _^

between himself and Admiral Dewey on
board the Olympia, April, 1S93, in which
it is stated Admiral Dewey promised in
dependence to the Filipinos, was shown to
the admiral to-day by an Associated Press
reporter. The admiral characterized it a
"tissue of falsehoods." He declared it ab
surd on its face. "I not only had no
power to promise Independence to the
Filipinos." said he, "but the whole tenor of
the words put in my mouth stamps them
as false. 1 am made to say things which

HOXOUM.!'. July l<J.-NV,t unexpected- I
IF Oowrnor Dolt lias caused tht political !
sensation or the hour, and if one could
believe tho majority faction of local Re
publicans has irretrk-vably injured their j
propp*-cts fnr the legislative campaign. It ]
all springs* forth from his appointments !
<n the restoration boards throughout ihe '
islands. So accustomed to rule and reign ]
< under thf thumbs of TfcUTBtUU and Coop
er; has been the Kxccutive lor the la:;t j
seven yea is that his board is composed j
entirely not only of nominal Republicans, j
but of the supporters of hiH peculiar fac- !
U<>n and personal friends, and for a little
burgh like this, in comparison, I believe
1 never saw ?uch an exciterm ntâ ev<n in
Han Francisco's warmest days cf politics. \
The Thurpton element was downed iit Â¦
the primaries and in convention, and yet |
Lorrin's cousin and chlel lieutenant is
raaii* chairman of th<- R. Â¦gisiratiun Board.
The mala ki<-k comes from the- Repub
lican Â«MÂ«~ purity in poiitk-s--who hopÂ«*d
that Governor Dole uoul<l decide in fa
vor of fair play ami give to the Democrat;
Independents at least one seat among
three, but lhÂ»Â» Governor (snored the Cen
tral Territorial committee* of these par
ties. aÂ« did his experienced registrar of j
voters, and appointed whomsoever he '
plea>Â«>d. There is not a bad man on th<* {
list, but the Governor h.-is kinrlly furnish
ed to the Democrats a weapon to knife
Republicans- at the polls. Just wh<>n Re
publicans required the utmost assistance.
Dole's Explanation.
The Governor's explanation is this: He
claims that our registration laws ci o not
require parlies to De represented on
boards: that us we liavo not yet held
an election here we tion"t know "uÂ» which
party voters belong; that it never entered
his mind to have only one party repre
sented; that the position of chairman was
first offered to -Â«iajor Camara, a lipcio
crat. who had before held the office and
he declined it. and thnt neither jhe Re- j
publican nor Democratic Central commit- 1
tÂ»Â»es had approached him with recommen- I
dations. i
Th-< mattr-r may be brought up to-night
at the meeUns of the Central Republican
Territorial Committee, which me;ets for
permanent organization.
Another matter that Is R-ivir.j; great dis
piearure is the taxing: by tho Supreme
Court of each man naturalized as an
American citizen the sura of $7 50 under
one of our former Hawaiian laws which
It Is ojalraed was not repeal<Â»d by our
organic law. I am informed that whÂ»n

point, if it can be properly brought before

rangemer.ts can be made*.
Substitutes for Asiatics.
An attempt. It is said, is to be made
W supplant Asiatic and Japanese labor
on the plantations by importing 10.000
young men who. it is claimed, are work
ing in certain of the mainland States at
J]2 50 a month. The Independent suggests
that as men already exceed women to a
most alarming preponderancy some 15,000
women should be imported in the interest
of morality and the creation of American
citizens. Any one intimate with the con
ditions of Hawaii will appreciate the
moral, especially in the face of the atti
tude of the Japanese Government in con
nection with future free immigration to
these islands.
In the meantime the now "free" labor
ers, exempt from their contracts, are
pouring into Honolulu, where they are not
wanted and where in all probability the
vagrancy act will have to be before long
enforced against them, for the benefit of
the lawyers, as the laws are imperfect.
Perhaps one of the most Interesting
pvents in Honolulu for many years has
been the public appearance as a lecturer
in our largest (Progress) hail of Leung
Chi Tso. the reformer and personal friend
of .thp Emperor, Kwang Su (the Ameri
can Maru brings news of his death, but
ihe Chinese do not believe the report).
The hall was filled to it." utmost capacity
with young Chinamen, mostly born and
educated jn Hawaii, and. as a rule, tri
linguistFâEnglish, Hawaiian and Chinese,
and hoys who have honors, mental and
athletic, at Oahu. Iolani and elsewhere.
Thorp wpre also probably nrarly a hun
dred whites of thÂ«Â» missionary families,
including many ladie?.
; . ;, Chinese Reformer at Work.
The reformer, whose aim Is the restora
tion of thÂ«Â» Emppror, has the Infinite
pleasure of knowing that the Empress*
Dowager and Prince Tuan, the father of
the child destined to succeed the Em
poror. will pay $125,000 for his head dead
or bis 1 body alive â the latter preferred for
tho p?kÂ«> of torture. And yet he has trav
erped our islands and collected at least
$50,000 for the sake'of his cause.
On "the evening in question he stood on
the platform as cool and collected^ as a
professional lecturer. Garbed in the con
ventional evening dress and sans queue,
he impropsod his audience as being a man
of quick magnetic power, of indomitable
will and trained intelligence, and a fatal
ist without fear.
As for the lecture itself, it was delivered
in Chine*** and translated by an Oahu
i'oUese- graduate. Mr. Kentwell. the son
of a man whom all Americans honor. Its
maip points wore that the present deca
dence of China was due to the pernicious
influence of the Km press Dowager and
Prince Tuan. who controlled the Boxers
and were opposed to the ideas of Western
civilization and progress. The Emperor
wÂ»s a student and a friend to foreigners,
and would welcome them with an open
hand. The inexhaustible wealth of China
might be developed by friendly hands
but if the great powers strove to divide
China ihry would meet with 490.000,000 of
un'.U-d Chinese, who would forget all save
the defense of their country.
Bow Wongs Arrested.
Thore came an unpleasant surpriseâ no,
rot a surprise, for the Low Wongs had'
been warnedâ but a realization of the fact
that they wer? rebels against the actual
if not the nominal Government of China,
by tho information being received here'
that the names of every member of tho
Bow Wong (Emperor's reform society)
were in the hand* of their enemies in
China and that their relatives were being
arrested right and left, to be punished for
tho sins of their reralcitrant children.
Thore were some very cruel arrests made
ard the blame has been thrown upon our
local Chinese Consul, who was ordered to
Hrst give warning, and if that warning
was not efficacious then to report the
names of the members of the society, and
over 10.000 names were reported. ,
The sequoi arrived on Saturday night
when an open-air mass-meeting of some
3000 Chinese was held and the following
resolutions adopted:
That ft in thr wmiw of the" Chinese residents

SIERRA CITY. July 23.â The San Fran
cisco Supervisors' Investigating Commit
tee on Water Systems left Tallac yester
day for the purpose of Inspecting the wa
tersheds en the Yuba River. The party
reached Truckee last evening and a start
was made early this morning for the 160
mile trip across the main ridge of the
Sierras. The.trip was uneventful. An ar
ticle published In a San Francisco paper
to the effect that the city officials are lia
ble to removal from office because they
were out of the State without permission
from the Mayor caused much amusement
and considerable chaffing. The members
contend there are two reasons why they
v.-lll not be removed from office.
First, that thty were not out of Cali
fornia; and.
Second, they were engaged in the trans
action of municipal business, and hence
are not amenable to the charter pro
vision on the subject.
The only point in Nevada touched at
was when the steamer Tahoe City, which
is a California bottom, landed passengers
at Glenbrook.
Reed has promised he will give employ
ment to his colleagues on his Butte ranch
If thev are removed.
The committee made a stop at Camp
bell Hot Springs for lunch and the beau

make their home after that is not decided
It is said, however, that Mr. Sewall will
seek another diplomatic appointment
from the President. If this if? so his po
sition as member of the Republican Na

for the application in case President Mc-
Kinley is re-elected. In that event he
could be nominated by the President from
Hawaii, as well as from Maine, depend
ing on which he considered his residence
at the time.

JESTER BURNED A
TRUNK WHILE IN KANSAS
FT.TMSU. July 22.â The Kumassi re'.i-f
column,' has just arrived here from Ku
mas$l, which it left July 17, bringing the
old garrisonâ about twenty fairly fit men,
seventy broken-down invalids and some
women and children in a pitiable condi
tion.
The success of Colonel Willcocks Is due
to the choice of a route not suspected by
the Ashantis, who had concentrated in
thousands along the eastern route, but in
much smaller numbers along the western
route, via Picci, which Colonel Willcocks
adopted.
Even as it was the Ashantis were active
and the roads knee deep in mud. Colonel
Willcocks took a couple of villages by
bayonet charge. Beyond Ekwanda he
found the tribesmen in n strong position
behind stockades. It was a large war
camp, with the chief commander of the
Ashanti army, estimated at 4000 men.
After a heavy lire on both sides for
nearly an hour Colonel Willcocks ordered
a bayonet charge and the troops rushed
the thick bush, cheering vigorously. The
Ashantis did not wait for the bayonets,
but fled in confusion.
The casualties of Colonel Willcocks
were two officers wounded, two natives
killed and seventeen wounded. "
On finding Kumassi in such terrible con
dition Colonel Willcocks. after cutting
brush and burning the bodies, placed the
whole ' force upon half-rations, an ar
rangement cheerfully borne. No opposi
tion was met on the return.

crime was committed. His body was rid
dled with bullets.
Sheriff Fulgham defended his prisoner
to the last, but a dense smoke from a
combination of tar, feathers and oil, fired
by a crazed mob, was too much for him
and he was dragged from . the jail and
placed under a physician's care. Will

the crowd and up the jail steps, was shot
by the Sheriff and dangerously wounded.
After battering down the doors and

BRYAN RECEIVES MANY
DEMOCRATIC POLITICIANS
LINCOLN'. Nebr., July 23. -The rain
storm kept William J. Bryan indoors to
dsy. but time did not hang heavily on his
hands. He had a number of visitors dur
ing the day, three of political promi
nence, lx>5ng General James B. Weaver
of Iowa, lx>uis C. Khrich of Colorado
FpringF, Colo., and John E. Pitts of Cin
cinnati. Mr. Pitts is secretary of the Na- >
tional Democratic Campaign Club of thÂ«i
Commercial Travelers and he claims many
accessions to the ranks of the organizn
tion. He told Mr. Bryan that, the trust*
question Â»a? the all-important one. and
on tliis issue he would make great gains.
He said the Democratic- traveling' men
proposed to establish headquarters in
every city of Importance in the country.
Mr. Khrich. who is the Colorado mom
b< r of an anti-imperialistic league, called
to tell of the progress being made in the I
West. He told Mr. Bryan that while he j
vuted with the gold Democrats four years I
apo, l-.e was for nim now. j
<len^ral Weaver was on his way home
from Idaho, where lie had attended the
â¢ usion State Convention. He and Mr.
Bryan were toprtli^r some time.
A story circulated here to-day, though
not credited to Mr. Bryan or his visitors, j
is to the effect that Charles A. Towne
will remain on the ticket as Populist can

in Chicago early in August.
McKINLEY'S BUSY DAY.

CANTON. 6., July 23.â President McKin

persons who came on personal matters,
such as pensions or little matters before
one or another of the departments, hop

prompt or more satisfactory results. For
the most part these were greeted on the
porch, where the President met them with
a hearty handshake and listened atten
tivc-ly to their statements.
Much time was spent in the library,
where the official business is conducted,
but not an inkhng of news in regard to
China or any other subject was given out.

SKAGUAT, Alaska, July 16, via Vic
toria, July 23.â The work of delimiting
the provisional boundary in the disputed
Alaskan Yukon territory in that part
crossing the Dalton Trail and touching
the Porcupine district having been com
pleted, the United States citizens in the
district find they have lost a large part of
what they believed was rightfully United
States territory. The survey has been
run and the monuments set within the
last few weeks by O. H. TIttman of
Washington and W. F. King of Ottawa
and assistants, who have simply followed
instructions as set forth in the modus Vi
vendi agreed to provisionally some months
ago by Secretary Hay on the part of the
United States and the British representa
tive after the adjournment of the Joint
High Commission. The survey and de
marcation of the line leaves nearly one
half of the Porcupine sold mines in Brh-
Ish territory, and it has been the general
opinion for a long time that the mines, in.
fact, the entire Porcupine district, was on
the Alaskan side. Much of the Dalton
toll road, leading to Porcupine City, now
lies within Canadian territory also; that
is, it is. on the Canadian side' of the iron
monuments set on the provisional line.
The United States miners in the Porcu
pine district, having watched the devel
opment of the work of delimiting and
marking the boundary, were immediately
aroused over the result of so much of the
mining district being left on the British
side, and were not long in addressing a
protest to President McKinley. The
names of 146 miners are attached to the
protest, a copy of which reached here
yesterday. It will be considered by the
Skaguay Chamber of Commerce thin
week. The protest is emphatic. It says,
in part:
The modus vivendi has permitted
the British to seize acres of the pub
lic domain, consisting of river bed3
and benches containing rich deposits
of gold. All of Klaheena River and
Copies of the protest have been sent to j
the Chambers of Commerce or San Fran- I
Cisco, Seattle, Skajruay and Portland, with I
a request for co-operation. A committee |
of the Skaguay Chamber of Commerce
has just waited upon Commissioner Titt- ,
man. and he has received them courte
ously, pivinp information corresponding
generally with the statements set forth by
the. Porcupine miners. No blame is at
tached to Mr. Titt man.' for he acted mere
ly according to Instructions in the work
of making the physical markings of the ;
boundary. The commission will be in th?
vicinity of Skaguay for a month, delim
iting the provisional line in White Parf3
and Chilkoot Pass.

Glacier and Boulder creeks, upon
which Americans spent thousands of
dollars in prospscting, is taken away
from their rightful proprietors. The
iron posts demarking the boundary
are crowded up to the foothilJ, cross
ing and recrossing the Dnlton toll
road, thus cutting off our entrance to
and exit from our mining camps. All
this makes our future look uninvit
ing. We protest to you, Mr. Presi
dent, against the unjust seizure of
the Klaheena above Klukwan, which
is only ten miles from tidewater,
whereas' we are entitled to the coun
try twenty miles beyond Klukwan,
including the Klaheena River and
Boulder and Porcupine creeks, upon
which Americans have made valuable
discoveries at great expense cf time
and money. Did you not say you
were not in favor of ceding one inch
of the public domain? Here are thou
sands of acres of rich mining ground
that the British are inclosing within
their iron posts. Will you not, Mr.
President, act with the people and see
that these posts are moved back?"

SAX DIEGO, July 23.â There Is much excitement among the miners In the
eastern part of this county and the residents of Yuma over the discovery of
what Is believed to be a bed of oil In the pot-holes district on the Colorado
River, about fifteen miles north of Yuma. A rush was made for the scene of
the discovery and a scramble for land within the belt became so exciting
that some of the first locators were compelled to use rifles in protection of
their rights. Persons who arrived late upon the scene attempted to encroach
upon the claims already taken up and bloodshed was narrowly averted.
Several thousand acres of land were filed upon and a number of people are
still staking out claims In the vicinity of the original discovery. Notices
locating ten claims of sixty acres each were filed In the County Recorder's
office to-day by persons who were among the first In the field. Just what the
find will amount to will depend entirely upon development, as surface Indica
tions are not sufficient to determine anything definite. The prospect consists
of an oily substance that has oozed out of the ground In large quantities In a
number of places. While the substance has the appearance of petroleum, it
has been evaporated by the summer heat to such an extent that Its classifica
tion will require a chemical anaylsls. The geological conditions, however,
according to the opinion of experts, are very favorable and the existence of
a large body of petroleum In that district is highly probable. The claims of .
a number of miners overlap and It Is feared that If oil Is really found ihat
trouble will ensue.

From Martin's Camp, on Mount Wilson,
the report is received that the fire Is
spreading, that the flames are beyond
control and that the element is working
its way slowly north and south and
sweeping everything before it. So far
there has been no loss of life, but an im

Sturtevant'a Camp, with its large num

from a spark that was blown from the
smokestack of a drilling outfit that is
operating at the mouth of the canyon.
The dry period has been augment

that yesterday reached 93 degrees,
causing everything to be dry as tinder.

however, by the sudden breeze that soon
caused the entire forest to be like a fur
nace, the flames sweeping furiously up
the sides of the canyon walls.

magnitude of the work.
They left the vehicle and went up the
canyon on foot. The flames were spread
ing rapidly and the sightseers had to run
for their lives down the rocky steep. They
succeeded in wetting their clothes at two
different places and at one point crossed
the burned district. The roaring of the
fire warned the driver of the tally-ho, and
he sent his horses at a gallop to a neigh
boring clearing. By good judgment the
party eventually reached the conveyance.
When the fire was first observed a tally
ho party from Los Angeles had driven to
the mouth of the canyon early in the day.
The party consisted of Mrs. E. Walter,
Mr. and Mrs. E. Xicoll, Mr. and Mrs. R.

Claimed to Be an Endeavorer, but Is
e u *Â£* d J s coyerers recovered from their surprise they determined to
sound the depths of the cavern. Great rocks were hurled down the pit The
whlrrtrff of the falling stones could be heard, growing fainter and fainter in
their descent, but no sound of their striking bottom nor splash, if there Is a
subterranean stream, could be heard. Then the men threw down sticks of
dynamite. If they exploded, none of the men listening heard the faintest
echo. It may be that there is a great cave at the bottom of this pit but it
remains for some dauntless explorer-some one who has extraordinary cour
ageâto venture into the chasm.
The cavern is located at the headwaters of Lagnna Creek, which furn
ishes the water supply of Santa Cruz. Xot far from the cavern the creek dis
appears, taking an underground channel, and reappears about a mile below
the sink. It is probable, therefore, that the water flows through the cavern
at a groat depth. As the creek sinks some distance away, it is further rea
sonable to suppose that the pit is one of the entrances to a great cavern or
series of caverns, which extends far under the mountain.
It may be that the blast of the limekiln workers has uncovered another
Mammoth Cave.
SAXTA CRUZ, July 23 â fp in the foothills, twelve miles from Santa
Cruz, a bottomless pit has been discovered. For aught man knows to the
contrary now. it may roach to China. But the persons who discovered it
are inclined to believe the pit leads to a great cave.
Tills wonderful chasm or abyss, which has been added to the natural won
ders of the county, was discovered a few days ago in a most singular man
r.er. \\ orkmen were engaged In blasting lime rock near Russell's new kiln
After the dust end smoke of one of the blasts had settled, the men went to
remove the rock, when to their astonishment they beheld an orifice in the
supposedly solid hillside, the mouth of a pit that yawned black and forbld
clng.

PETALUMA. July 23.-S. H. Church.
one or the wealthiest and most highly es
teemed pioneer residents of this vicinity,
Â¦was shot and mortally wounded at his
home in Two Hock Valley, eight miles
Â¦west of Petaluma and just across the line
dividing Sonoma and Maxin counties, by
i\ E. King of Skaggs Springs. The shcot
lr.g occurred at 9 o'clock this mornij-g-.
and the wounded man died a.t 4:30 this aft
ernoon.
The shooting followed a trivial quarrel
commenced Sunday ; evening between
King and Si Stice, a son-in-law of the
murdered man. King, who is an itinerant
piano tuner, travels through the country
with a camp outlit and trades horses or
anything that comes his way. He camped
Sunday near the Church ranch in a gum
tree grove after he had been warned oft
the premises, lie had four horses with
him. a Iieavy jf-agon and a two-horse
bUÂ£gy. He was also forbidden to water
tils horses on the ranch, as the water
there Is scarce at this time of the year.
Monday moriiing Stice saw King water
ing his horses at the trough in tne barn
yard. The men had svme words and King
"wex.t away With his nurses. Shortly be
fore S o'clock istice saw King- tearing the
boards off an old well in a neij oa the
Church ranch. Stice, with Mr. Church
vent down to the well and made re-pairs.
No words were exchanged with King till
after the well was boarded over. i"hea
Slice toid King to stay on ills own side of
the fence. Church added that if he did
rot he would have him arrestttL King
grew ug]y and s^aid. "I've a mind to shoot
you botn." King had a 32-caUtÂ»er ride in
bis hand. Just as Church turned away
King raised the gun and fired. The bullet
struck Church in the right side, just above
the groin. The old man sank to the
ground. Stice turned and ran and King
jired at but missed him. Then Slice dodged
behind a gum tret?.
King then went back to his camp, while
Stice secured aid .and conveyed Mr.
Church to his residence, where he died iit
4 o'clock.
After the shooting King offered to as
sist his victims relatives to move him into
the house, but the offer was declined
King then said that he was going to Santa
Hopa and would give himself up to Sheriff
Grace. He and his wife hastily left the
camp, taking only the four hor.-es and the
buggy and a rifle and shotgun. King rode
one of the horses, while his wife drove
two hitched to the buggy, the fourth aiii
ir.nl being led.
Theodore King, at the Edeneo creamery,
oifrht railos from hero, saw the man,
Â¦woman and horses pass his house. Mar
shal Collins and posse of officers are
scouring the country, and the Sheriffs of
Sonoma and Mariu counties will probably
join in the chase.
King, the shooter, lives about four miles
from Skaggs Springs. lie has been around
Fetaluma considerably, always camping
out. Along with his trading he combine*
the business of piano tuning. Sundav
night he stopped at the Bloom ranch. The
dog* began a terrific barking and King
became angry. He swore at a man who
went from the house to see what the dogs
were barkir.gr about and they had a heated
argument. King suddenly raised his rifle
and shot and killed one of the dogs. He
had also raised a disturbance at a neigh
boring ranchf. Sunday he pitched his
camp jn tne prove near the Church ranch
Mr. Church was one of the early
pioneers here and was the owner of three
large ranches in the northern part of this
county. He was 71 years old. and leaves
several grown-up sons. Mr?. Church was
famous here a? a lover of fast horses, and
for years past has been the owner of
many horses that had more than local
reputations. Coroner Eden will hold an
inquest to-morrow at ' Tomales. District

To-night the white fishermen are mak
ing vicious threats regarding the destruc
tion of property. The Dominion Govern
ment wired the Provincial Government to
day that it was the duty of the British
Columbia Legislature to look after the
fishermen, not the Canadian Government.
As the Provincial Legislature has not
acted upon the matter the canners wired
that they would have the militia called
out according to the laws of Canada gov
erning such cases, namely through three
Justices of fhe Peace. The canners are
now awaiting the result of the attempt of
the Japanese to fish in the river. If they
should be again intimidated by the whites
they will call out the militia. It Is ex
pected that the Vancouver Volunteers,
under command of lieutenant Colonel
Worsnop, will be chosen for duty.
At noon the Japanese announced their
determination to go out fishing, and on
being warned by the white fishermen that
they would be shot if they did they mus
tered all their forces and proceeded to
where f>00 white fishermen were holding a
meeting and displayed their full strength,
there being fully 300 little brown men in
the crowd. They then lined up four deep
and paraded the streets, some of them
carrying revolvers.

SEATTLE, Wash., July 23.â Juneau has
a full fledged placer mine excitement, ac
cording to advices brought from the north
to-day by the steamer Rosalie. When
the vessel sailed from Juneau July 18 a
stampede was on to the new plafltr dig
gings on Glacier Bay, about 150 miles dis
tant. Some doubt existed as to the placers
being really new discoveries. Not a few
believe them to be diggings found and
operated many years ago by the RusÂ»
sians. In any event, the finds are most
promising. It Is claimed for them that
an experienced miner can make consid
erably more than wages. Fully 200 people,
it is estimated, have gone from Juneau
alone to the scene of the new discovery.
The bars In the mouth oÂ£ Glacier Bay
are all said to contain gold.

George \\ . Hazen of Portland says:
"Nome is the greatest fake In the history
of the Pacific Slope. The beach is a frost,
the tundra a joke, the creek limited,
shallow and not phenomenal, and the
town a bubble." It cannot support more
than 3000 persons, Hazen says, and there
were 15i)0 persons without a place to sleep
when he was there. The health of the
town was in a deplorable condition. There
were thirty cases of smallpox, to his
knowledge, many said more, and much
typhoid and pneumonia. A pesthouse had
been built at the back of the tundra, and
funerals averaged three a day.
PLACER MINES NEAR JUNEATJ.
Mr. Kossuth says Xome is a frost with
out any assistance from nature. The city
is contained in a long street, wherein live
18,000 to 20,000 people. There is another
tract of land supposed to be a street,
but it is all mire and swamp. Great
quantities of goods of all description are
piled high on the beach, including tons
and tons of machinery and gold ma
chines of all kinds. Regarding the mines
Mr. Kossuth stated that for a distance of
about eighty-five miles, from Topkuk to
ten miles above Nome, the ground has
been worked over thoroughly. The
creeks are small and narrow, and owing
to the great size of the claims staked no
room was left for more stakers.
Lawrence Sinclair, who left Nome July
4, said Nome is the most lawless camp in
the world. He was in the Cripple Creek
stampede, and with all the lawlessness of
that place there never was anything to
equal the unabashed deviltry of all kinds
in Nome. There may be gold at Nome,
he said, but he did not see a color that did
not come from down the river or on the
steamers. The beach was long ago
worked out. He panned thirty pans on
what was said to be the best claim on the
beach. In one pan there may have been
as much as two cents. The owner said
his average was $3 per day.
Ernest Dechenes, who left" Nome on July
3, said: "At Nome during three day's
about the end of June there were five
shooting affrays and five men were buried
as a result. Many people have been
drowned in crossing: the mouth of the Yu
kon while going to St. Michael. Many
bodies have been washed on the beach
and there are others that will never be
found. One steamer picked up three
boats well out in Bering Sea. Their occu
pants had been carried out by wind and
tide from the Yukon and were in despair
when picked up. The bodies of seven men
and two women were picked up close to
gether."
Hugh Madden says that The fuel famine
worked great hardship. Wherever there
is a fire there are people waiting, frying
pan in hand, for a chance to warm up
something to eat. He saw as many as
thirty people waiting. Water sells at
three pails for a quarter and meals" are
a dollar.
VICTORIA. B. C, July 23.-Lawrenca

Hazen, the two former of Dawson and the
latter of Portland, have returned from

others.

THE ST. LOUIS STRIKE
THE PARAMOUNT ISSUE.
THE CONGRESSIONAL ELECTIONS.
CUJROM the way in which the campaign is shaping
i itself, it is becoming evident that the elec
tions in the Congressional districts will re
quire careful attention from Republicans and
conservative Democrats generally. Efforts will be
made to carry the House, even if Bryan be de
feated, and it is probable that a good many Demo
crats who are opposed to the Kansas City ticket will
unite with the Bryanitcs in the contest. At any rate
there is enough danger of such combinations to ren
der it necessary for the upholders of the administra
tion to nominate strong men in every district and
give them an earnest and energetic support.
An illustration of the danger is to be seen in the at
titude taken by some of the leading conservative
Democratic papers in the East. Thus, for example,
the Philadelphia Record, one of the stanchest of gold
Democratic papers, recently said: "If the men of
Democratic principles who cannot support Mr. Bryan
should devote their energies to the election of Demo
cratic Representatives they could wipe out the Repub
lican majority in the lower branch of Congress. A
gain of less than twenty districts would do this.
There have been many indications that a very large
proportion of Democrats are not blindly attached to
the Bryan hefesy. Of a Democratic majority in the
House more than half would give no countenance to a
fruitless free silver agitation. Hence there would be
a decided gain for the traditional principles of Democ
racy and a blockade of pernicious Republican legis
lation. The attainment of these ends is worth a
mighty struggle, and the promise of victory is bright."
That is the situation, and there can be little doubt
that in a good many districts the old free traders who
are not free silver men will gladly avail themselves of
the opportunity it offers. The danger is as great in
California as in any other State. Consequently we
cannot afford to take chances in a single district. In
every case where the present Representative has ren
dered faithful service he should be rcnominated, for it
is desirable to have not only good Republicans, but
Representatives of experience and of influence in Con
gress. Anything which tends to cause divisions in the
ranks of the party or is likely to alienate the indepen
dent vote should be carefully avoided. The fight for
control of the House is the danger point of the cam
paign, and it is there that we must be on guard.
Minister Wu's confidence that the foreign Ministers
in Peking are safe and that they can be produced
alive is at least interesting. Certainly if the Dowager
Empress have any Ministers up her sleeve it is time
for her to make a showdown.

The Geneva Convention which met In Ge

outcome of a discussion had in that citv

a book, "Souvenir de Polfprino." written
by M. Durant, showing the necessity of
supplementing medical and sanitarv "ser
vice on the battlefield by volunteer as
sistants, trained and organized -in times
of peace. The Ideas of Durant were ap
proved, and then followed the interna
tional convention. The code governing the
societies is that each country shall have
Its committee to co-operate with the army

the government, and in time of pence oc
cupy itself In preparing supplies, training
nurses, etc.; during war to furnish the

POPULAR AND ELECTORAL VOTE-
A. J., Seattle, Wash. A candidate for the
office of President of the United States
may receive the popular vote, yet not be
elected because under the present plan
of voting a small majority counts as
much if not more than a larger one. For
instance: Smith and Jones are candidates
for trje Presidency. Suppose there are six
Electors in a State and that these are
e^?^S d on Sm 'th's side by a majority of
100.000 and seven Electors in another State
are elected on Jones' side by a bare plu
rality of 1000; Smith's populaV majority of
99.0U0 is overcome by Jones' electoral ma
jority of 1. In the election or Rutherford
13. Hayes one electoral vote outweighed a
popular majority of 250^35. James A. Gar
field had but 7018 majority on the popular
vote over \V. S. Hancock, but he had 59
electoral majority. Abraham Lincoln at
the second election had an electoral ma
jority over George B. McCleilan of 191.
while his popular majority was 3Q7.0<>0.
Franklin Pierce in 1852 was elected over
Â¦\Vinfield Scott by a popular majority of
less than 215.000. yet his electoral major
ity was 212 votes out of 254.

PROBATE FRAUDS.
HERE'S TO LAUGH.
FOR GOOD CANDIDATES.
THE most important local movement thus far
taken in the campaign was that of last evening,
which resulted in the organization of the Busi
ness Men's Republican Club. The aim of this move
ment if to assure Republican success and the welfare
of the city and the State by bringing about the nomi
nation of candidates of such excellence that they will
have net only the support of all loyal Republicans.
but also that of the independent vote, which of late
ha? been so strong.
That intent is clearly set forth in the resolutions,
which, after declaring that Republican success is es
sential to the prosperity of city. Shte and nation, say:
"That in our judgment such success can only be ob
tained by nominating persons for office who will com
mand the confidence of the voters, and in view of
the late developments concerning probate proceed
ing-, we demand that the five Candidates for the office
of Superior Judge shall be selected with unusual care
and that they be lawyers well fitted for that respon
sible position. We also detmnd that the candidates
for the Legislature shall be imen who will worthily
represent the interests of this: city; and if such nomi
nations are made for the bench and Legislature, we
I,ledjze <~iur active support."
There is the issue in a nutshell. Good nominations
meati the support oi the business men of the city.
They mean victory. Bad or weak nominations will
result in defeat.
Another notable feature or the proceedings of the
meeting; *as the manifestation of the fact that the
business men well understand that the way for them
to bring about the nomination of good men is to take
ar. active part in the primaries. As was pointed out,
the primary election is the strategic point of the local
campaign. Should the better element of the party
triumph there, the rest will be plain sailing.
It is in the highest deerec gratifying to have so
many r>i the most influential and most public-spirited
of our business men organize for active work in local
politics.' It is in line with the policy The Call has all
along advocated and strenuously urged. It comes at
i critical period of ih* local campaign and assures
victory. It is the most sipnificant event that has re
cently happened in our politics, and is full of good
angary for the welfare of 'the municipality and the
State.
GRAND JURY INDICTMENTS.
/~~^ RAND JURY indictments were filed with
( I Judge Bahrs yesterday against Chretien, Lat-
ner and Hansted, for crimes committed in con
nection with the loo:ing of the Sullivan estate. Thus
the exposure by The Call of the frauds has not only
prevented the complete success of the conspirators
and brought about a confession from one of them, but
lias served the purpose of bringing three of them un
der indictment to answer for the crime.
Chretien has been indicted for obtaining money by
false pretenses, and indictments upon other charges
may be filed later on. Latner is charged with receiv
ing money by falsely impersonating another, and
Hansted is charged with a felony in making and ut
tering a fictitious instrument in writing for payment
of money. These charges will serve the purpose of
bringing the offenders to trial, and when all the evi
dence against them is brought out in court it is prob
able that they, like Chretien, will be called upon to
answer for other offenses also.
Rogers has thus far escaped indictment, but the
Grand Jury has not yet finished with his case. lie has
refused to answer questions asked him by the Grand
jury, and the District Attorney has requested the
court to compel him to answer such as relate to
ethers and, will not lead him to testify against him
self. That point the Judge is expected to decide to
day.
It is to be borne in mind, however, that so far as
Rogers' guilt is concerned there is no need for him
to testify against himself. He swore before Judge
Troutt that he had received no money for withdraw
ing his objection to the distribution of the estate to
the bogus heir, and The Call has published the tes
timony of witnesses who contradict him flatly and
swear they paid him money for that consideration.
There is. then, a valid ground for the indictment of
Rogers for perjury, if for nothing else, and the Grand
Jury should proceed accordingly.
The cases now being fairly before the courts. The
Call has no further duty to serve in connection with
them than that of reporting the proceedings.
The prosecution of pet sons charged with crime is the
duty of law officers, not of the press, and The Call
has no desire to take part in it. In the interests of
public welfare it has exposed the frauds, furnished the
evidence, saved the estate from final distribution
among the conspirators, and now leaves the prosecu
tion, conviction and punishment of the offenders to
the bench and bar.
There are many curious things about the gathering
of the nations to make war on China, not the least of
which is the fact that all the armies of the white race
are likely to be commanded by the mulatto who has
gone to the front in charge of the French troops. A
descendant of the black race leading all the white
races to make war on the yellow race leaves nothing
to be desired but the appearance of a red man as a
peace commissioner.

NO WAR WITH CHINA.
ALREADY one may see the wisdom of keeping
out of the complications which arise in the
complex ambitions of Europe. While the ac
tual slaughter of foreigners in China and the rumors
of appalling crimes are cultivated as a pretext, the
only sentiment they seem to excite among the Euro
pean nations is that of conquest and partition.
It may be said without being unfair that the blood
shed would have been limited to the first outbreak
and the legatio'ns would not have been besieged if the
other powers had permitted Japan to throw her splen
didly equipped army at once into China. While there
is no doubt that the Japanese force would have
reached Peking, its appearance would not have excited
the rage and resentment which were caused by the
landing of the much smaller allied forces. To refuse
to let Japan take the initiative was a criminal policy,
and the nations responsible for it are not guiltless of
what has followed. It was the natural thing to do.
Pitting one Asiatic power against another removed
the religious feature r.nd all its friction from the situ
ation, and would have diverted China to entirely new
issues.
It was not permitted for fear that Japan would
claim some fruits of her victory, if she won it. That
was the trouble. The pirates of Europe, that have
jangled and jawed while their people were being tor
tured, care less for the blood that is spilled than for
the territory that may be grabbed.
If Japan had been given free rein most important
consequences might have followed. It was possible
that a Japanese dynasty might have been set up at
Peking. The rulers of China have heretofore come
from other races than the pure Mongol and from
other nations than China proper. The imposition upon
that country of a Japanese dynasty would have been
the means of improving the civilization of China.
Japan has absorbed the modern spirit thoroughly.
and. controlling the vast population of China, coull
have influenced it more usefully than all the West
ern nations combined.
Not only in hampering Japan, but in pursuing the
same policy toward each other, the European nations
have written into history a disgraceful chapter.
England, whether from policy or necessity, has held
a more reasonable attitude, but already the bawling
of the British jingo is heard and the Cabinet is evi
dently under sore pressure. The news from China
has obviously been manipulated to suit the conspiracy
of the powers. The announcement that China has de
clared war against Christianity is intended to appeal
to the jingro feeling everywhere, and to start the pul
pit in every country preaching a new crusade.
The United States should maintain an independent
attitude. We must not involve ourselves in territorial
ambition, nor can we become an ally of China against
the powers that propose war upon her. This Govern
ment cannot embark in a crusade in defense of Chris
tianity, for it is a secular Government and not a
theocracy, nor bound to defend anywhere any form of
the religious idea.
China has a perfect right to make war upon Chris
tianity if she wish, for she and no other will have to
take the consequences. The so-called Christian nations
have beep provoking her for more than a century.
They have stolen her territory and abused her people
at home and abroad. They have made treaties with
her and violated them at will without making repara
tion to her, while exacting it from her for less vio
lation of treaty obligations.
The United States should demand of her reparation
for whatever our citizens have suffered and for what
ever insult may have been given us as a nation. When
?he squares this demand we 1 should remain absolutely
neutral. If Russia and Germany make war upon her
inimicallv to the interests of England and France, let
them and Oiina fight it out. Secretary Hay has al-
ready taken time by the forelock, as far as the open
door is concerned. The European Governments have
made an identical agreement with this country th.it
China shall remain open for trade on equal condi
tions to all of the commercial nations. If others go
there aggressively, and. making use of these bloody
I riots as a pretext, proceed to inflict punishment upon
I a nation for the crimes of individuals, we will not
be among the invaders and the carvers. The trade
of China must always originate in the need of the
Chinese for what they cannot produce. If the United
Ststes act wisely now. we will retain the commercial
sympathy of those people, and their trade will follow
rot only the sympathetic line, but, like the trade
of Europe, will come where the supply is the best
r.nd the cheapest. Therefore, for every reason that
czr influence commerce, our exchanges with China
will increase while those of the aggressive and pirati
cal nations will decline. Indemnity, reparation and
friendly neutrality should be our Chinese policy.
Ii should not be forgotten that Secretary Hay, by
wise foresight and timely action, has put us in a po
sition to follow that course, and bring interest, honor
and our traditional policy all into harmony.
A distinguished visitor from India says that there
is ever}' reason to believe that famine is likely to in
ctease in that death-sfyicken land. If this be true Eng
land will have small need for troops with which to
protect her Asiatic possessions. Death will leave
nothing to Protect. .
rioney not specifically payable in gold. The wages of
labor, and the thousands of millions of savings of the
irijduEtricus and thrifty poor would suffer the same
faie as the accumulations of the rich. The rich, in
cired, would not submit to be despoiled without resist
ance. As soon as it became known that on March 4.
1901, Mr. Bryan would be President and a Bryanite
Congress could be called together in extra session to
pass an unlimited silver coinage act, every holder of
securities liable to be paid in silver would hasten to
turn them into gold at the best price obtainable, and
a monetary pr.nic would ensue, more! violent than any
which the courtry has ever experienced."
So long as a candidate for the Presidency, sup
ported by a powerful party, threatens the country with
a debased coinage that will be the paramount issue be
fore ever}' man who earns wages or has savings in thj
banks. A depreciation of the value of money, bes-tie-:
being utterly dishonest, has the further evil in its na
ture that it will be more blighting upon labor than
upon any other interest. The intelligence of the peo
ple perceive.-, that fact, and accordingly in this cam
paign the one issue which the voters will recognize
will be that of determining whether we shall main

BY way of a concession to the conservatism of the
country the Democratic convention in renom
inating Bryan endeavored to make his candi
dacy more acceptable by subordinating the silver
I-lank to a secondary place in the platform, and de
claring with an array of sonorous words that the para
mount issue is that of imperialism. It was a bold
bluff, but up to this time it has had little or no effect.
In fact* the candidacy of Bryan is itself the paramount
issue put forth at Kansas City, and no effort on the
part of the Bryanite orators or organs can delude the
people into believing otherwise.
Bryanism means many things, but to the country it
large its worst portent is to be found in his dishonest
attitude toward all questions of capital and property
and money. His scheme for the free coinage of silver
if carried out along the lines he has persistently advo
cated would entail disasters unparalleled in our his
tory. *That menace of a fifty-cent dollar is the thing
that looms up before the mind of every man who.
gives the subject consideration. The sound-money
Democrat perceives clearly that this issue of financial
honesty and soundness is still before the country, and
thc> refuse to give consent to anything like an appro
val this year of a man whose nomination they rejected
four years ago.
Matthew Marshall! one of the foremost financial
vriters of the country, after reviewing the monetary
conditions of the republic and the relations of the
Bryanite movement to finance and the free coinage
of silver, says:
"Herein consists the peril with which the country is
threatened by the Democratic party. They propose to
re^rce. as in the twinkling of an eye, by more than
cue half, the value of all contracts for the payment of

The lecturer stated that one reason why
more men were total abstainers now was
because their business interests drmanded
it. Many business concerns refused to
employ a man unless they had sufficient
proof that he never touched liquor in any
form. On the oth^r hand, many tirms

Lake, that their employes brir.g liquor to

A Before the War Story of th.e Scheme
of Two Cubans to Raise Money.
Two gray-haired men met in the hotel
lobby and "with every evidence of deUsjni
at the meeting shook hands and forthwith
adjourned to the potation department.
"There's a story goes with that, said
the clerk to the rt-porter, jerking his head
over toward the retreating figures, 'ana (
if you will ask your coaenman to hitch
vour wagon to a star for a few brier mo
ments I'll give you the particulars as nar
rated to me tnis morning by the elder
party, who preceded his friend hither by
some eighteen hours.
"They are Cubans, as you may have in
ferred from their dark complexions, pro- i
ceeded the clerk. "The name of the oider ,
one is Mendez, and of the younger Guar- !
dia. and they have lived in the I â¢ nlt<?<l |
States for the past twenty years. While
they lived in Cuba they were accustomed
to visit this country every two or three
vears, having a business connection in
New York. This was before the Civil
War and traveling was not in those days
what it Is now. Still, they had money
and expense was no great object to them.
They used to come hither on any old ship i
that might be sailing when they were j
ready to start, there being no regular
lin.-s. and they would land in New Or
leans or Savannah or Charleston, as it
might happen, and sometimes thev would ]
get a ship sailing direct to New York.
* -'Once, and this is where the Ptory
comes In. they were delayed in New Or- Â¦
leans for two weeks and ran out of j
money. They didn't know anybody well j
enough to boVrow from, and they did not
want to write to their New York friends
If thev could devise any other scheme
whereby they might be saved. Finally
Mr Mendez evolved a brilliant Idea,
which was that Guardia should blacken
himself a little more than nature had
done for him and let Mendez sel! him as
a darky. Guardia thought H would be a
grent jok*. and they waited for n chance.
"Mendez Had a friend down along the
sugar coast somewhere, fifty or slxty
mlles from the city, and he asked him if
he could go down and spend a few days
with him. Of course such a request was
onlv too gladly answered In the affirma
tive and Mendez was invited to come and
stay three or four years If he wanted to.
Thev had money enough to buy two round
trip* tickets on the steamboat going that
war, and when the boat landed at Men
dez's friends plantation he went ashore,
followed by a darky body servant carry
ing his luggage. The body servant, it ,ls
hardly necessary for me to explain,
Guardia. fixed up for the occasion on the
boat as they came along.
"Mendez was received with open arms,
but poor Gutirdia had nothing to do except
to take his place in the quarters of the
real thing, and when he went into the b'.g
house to look after his master in his room
lie kicked like a steer and wanted to show
his hand; but Mendez pictured to him how
neoPSS ary it was for them to get funds
and this was the only way on earth for
them to do it. Guardia submitted, but he
did not stop kicking whenever the oppor
tunity offered. It was no 1oke to him. but
Mendez thoroughly enioyed the situation
and lost no opportunity to order his body
servant around like a tyrant of ancient
Rome.
"After a visit of four or five days, which
Mendez on loved a preat deal more than
Guardia did." he concluded to return to
New Orleans, and ordered Guardia to
pack up his traps. The boat came by In
the mornlnp. nnd the evening before Jlen
dpz. In a conversation with his host, re
ferred to his body-servant as a likely boy.
but said that he did not want to taT<e him
to New York with him. a?Â« he was trouble
pome to travel with and was expensive
without being especially necessary. Guar
dia. It seems, had made a fairly Rood Im
pression, and when his master spoke of
maklne some disposition of him other
than takinp him alons with him the host
made a proposition to buy him. Mendez
hesitated about selling him. but finally
agreed to let him jro for $1200. The host
objected to the fieures, but brought Guar
dla In for inspection. After looking him
over, duriner which operation Guardia
heard himself discussed in a more per

THE f.fth week of the Henry Miller
season at the Columbia Theater
opened most auspiciously last even
ing with "His Excellency the Gov
*>rr:or," a sparkling farcical romance, in
three acts, by R. Marshall.
The plot !s of the slightest. The unex
pected visit of an English government of
ficial, with ht* sister and charming daugh
ter, to the bachelor quarters of his Ex
cellency the Governor In a lone Island cf
her Majesty in the Indian Ocean forms
the basis of the play. The time of the
aforesaid visit, occurring as it does dur
irg the Feascn of the f.owfrir.g of the
sJoesâ the midsummer madness season in
"Amar.daland" â furr.ishes the complica
tion?. A supposed uprising of the natives.
In reality a demonstration of welcome to
the rppresentative of the great white
Queen, further complicates and affords
a<1ir.:rable fun at the expense of
comic officialdom.
The flowering of the aloes is responsible
for it all. The yellow pollen that is flying
:r. clouds with every breeze is said by the
natives to possess the properTiep of a love
potion. His Excellency the Governor ex
presses doubts on the subject, until temp
tation arrives in the shape of Miss Carl

Mr. Marshall has succeeded in giving us |
a piece of m<~>st rare and excellent fool- :
ingâ a thorooxbly wholesome specimen of I
English humor at its best. The situations !
are deliriously absurd, delightfully unex- ]

is cri^p and bright and sparkling with j
epigram. Here are a few glints one re

of lyric artists who are to appear.
Grand Opera House.
"The Great Ruby" began its second
week at the Grand Opera-house last even
ing. There is every prospect that it will
be continued for two or three weeks
longer. The attendance for Monday even-
Ing was fairly pood, especially in the up
per part of the house. Much admiration
was expressed for the excellence of the
scenery and settings. The company, which
consists of about three dozen people, has

Tisher's Concert House.
The now programme at Fischer's Con
cert House is crowded with novelty this
week. Mae Tunison. a soprano with a
pure and well cultivated voice, scored an
artistic success last night. James E.
Nichols, a local tenor, made his profes
sion;! 1 debut and was well received, in the
"Spirito Oentil" from "Favorlta." Daisy
Bishop, a clever soubrette, was new. aa
was also William Westin. who extracts
sweet music from finger bowls and gob
lets. Violet Johnson, the talented young
violinist, interpreted the first movement
from DeBeriot's Seventh Concerto and
Bach's Barcarolle. Deet3 and Don, the
novelty duo. reappeared, and the new
moving pictures were interesting. The
house was crowded.

At the Chutes last night La LIsta ap
peared in spectacular dances. Green way

sang new songs; the Ogdens appeared In

still the chief attraction at the Olympia.

Swallowed Laudanum.
Elva Peiz'r. a girl 10 years of age living
at 914 1-3 Harrison street, quarreled with
her mother yesterday morning and In a fit
of bad temper swallowed half an ounce
of laudanum. She was taken to the Re
ceiving Hospital and it was several hours
before she was pronounced out of danger.
PhÂ» was at a dance in Teutonia Hall Sun
day night, which was the cause of the
quarrel.
Ryley's comedians, kept another large
audience in a roar of laughter for two
hours and a half last night. The rough
points of the Sunday performance were
smoothed over. which. paradoxical
though it may fcem, made things go with
much more apparent jar and friction
than before. The cyclone, got into good
working order ar.d Rush City was blown
to Cactusvflle in brief and brisk fashion.
Sherrie Mathews as John J. Rush keeps
the excitement going for three acts and
he is ably seconded in his work by Har
ry Bulger as the rain maker. The rest of
the big company fill well their allotted
parts.
Alcazar.
"The Country Girl," a comedy written
by William Wycherley over two centuries
ago, was produced at the Alcazar Thea
ter last night. The house was crowded
with en audience that appreciated to the
utmost the tvit. humor and bits of de
lightful comedy that scintillated through
out the three acts of this old play. The
plot is simple. An old man wno la jruard
â¢an to a young, unsophisticated country
fj:rl wants to marry her for her fortune.
If she marries without his consent she
lose? the fortune. She falls in love with a
modest ynung gallant, who is hated by
the old guardian. She wins the const-Tit
of her guardian by a. subterfuge, weds the
man of her choice and retains her for
tune. Mies Florence Roberts as Peggy,
the simple country girl, played thÂ» part
with charming ingenuousness and realism.
Every point was brought out with a nat
uralness find ease that won for her the
enthusiastic applause of the large audi
ence. The park scene; where she appears
in boy's clothes, was one of the finest bits
of comedy that could be imagined. Her
innocence and impulsiveness and "cod
dling" ways stamped her as an artist of
the first rank in light comedv. She was
admirably eupiwrted by Theodore Roberts
a* the jealous, gr;:n* old guardian. Moody,
and by White Whittlesey as BelvMe. her
young lover. Clarence Montaine as
Sparkish. a senseless young fop in love
with AUthea. Moody's sister, and Edwin
T Emery as Harcourt, a cousin of Bel
ville. also in love with Alithea. added ma
terially to the success of the piece. Miss
Lorena Atwood ss Aiithea deserves a
word of praise, as she played the part
with grace and dignity. George P. Web
ster as Old Will ar.d Marie Howe as Lucy
had litÂ»le to d8. but did that little well.
The play should have a long run.
Orpheum.
Jessie Fadeham. who is billed under the
pimple title. "California songstress. " is
receiving the honors at the Orpheum this
week. This vocalist has not occupied a
considerable portion of the public's atten
tion until recently. If the generous re
ception she received last evening, how
ever, can be reMM upon as more than
the transient fancy of a. pleased audi
ence, her future will a?sure>jlv be envi
able. Joe J. Sullivan and Carrie Webber,
who appeared in Blanche Marsd^n's far
cfUc. "The Janitor." can also be counted
among the attractions of this week's' bill.
A new feature in the terpslchorean field
is presented bv Mazie King. The elec
trical effects that lend additional charm
to her graceful dancing are new and ef
fective. Etta Butler, a clever mimicâ
'n fact an actress of ability, though she
rnses solely as a mimicâ madfÂ» a lasting
Impression with the audience. Miss Lil

THE Grand Jury filed three indict
ments with Judge Bahrs yesterdayâ
one for Chretien, one for Latner and
one for Hansted. Rogers was not
mentioned except in the secret delibera
tions of the jury, but his case has not
been dropped.
In addition to the indictments filed the
District Attorney reported to the court
that Rogers had declined to answer ques
tions put to him, and he asked the court
to take cognizance of the matter. Judje
Bahrs was inclined to look upon the ques
tions asked as an attempt on the part of
the jury to compel Rogers to testify
against himself, but the District Attor
ney declared that the jurors wanted in
formation from Rogers about the other
persons mixed up in the rase, but that he
declined to furnish even what informa
tion he had about persons other than him
self. In fact, he would tell the jury noth-
Judge Bahrs finally decided he would
look into the matter, and to-day he will
confer with the District Attorney and per
haps render his opinion. In the mean
time Roger? will have a respite before the
jurv
The Indictment filed against Chretien
charges him with obtaining money under
false pretenses, the charge being- particu
larly based upon the $500 he received from
Rauer after Kauc-r had taken the debtpf
$150 and his $150 out of the $S>X> check. The
Grand Jury is not finished with Chretien
yet and at Its session next Friday it is
probable that at least one more indict
ment will be tiled against him, the charge
being forgery.
Charles L.atner was indicted for fel
ony to wit. receiving money by falseiy
personating another and in an assumed
character." The charge Is based upon the
fact that Latner received tTjO from Kauer
on the transfer of the estate, Â¦while at the
same time he knew thÂ« money was sup
posed to be delivered to the true heir of
Joseph Sullivan.
F"red Hansted. or "Dutehy." is charged
Â¦with "felony, to wit. making and uttering
a fictitious Instrument In writing for pay
ment of money." This charge is based
on the fact that Hansted signed the re
ceipt and assignment of the estate to
Raurr as a witness. In the case3 of Lat
ner and Har.stefl, it was explained by the
District Attorney, it was not r.eces^ary
that it should b*> proved that either man
actuallv rt-ceived any money or uttered
the fraduient Instrument?: it is only nec
essary that it be shown they were all
principals in the crime. Each one could
have Leen Indicted on any one of half a
dozen different charge", but It was deem
ed most advisable to indict them first on
separate charges, and then If the evi
dence brought out at the trials warrant
it they can be indicted on others.
Bench warrants were issued upon each
of the three indictment?, and the bail in
each case v.as pot at $10,000 bonds.
When the indictments had been filed and
the warrants issued they were turned
over to the nolice to frrvc. There was
no trouble in" serving Chretien, for he is
already in jail. The United States Dis
trict Attorney will be appealed to to ex
tradite Hansted. who Is In Nome, and
Latr.er will be dug up somehow. Captain
Seymour says. Hi? whereabout? is not
known at present, but Seymour says he
can find him.
The Grand Jury al?o took up the matter
of the hiring of private detectives by
Chlo* of Police Sullivan. He employed
them to watch his patrolmen ana paid
them from the police fun'ls. The Grand
Jury will make a thorough investigation
of t'ha virhnif nffalr

Answer Questions Will Be Considered
To-Day by Judge Bahrs.

ADVESTISEMEXTS.T7 T will be a surprise as well as a gen
uine pleasure to the numerous friends
II of H. C. Bush to hear that he has been
materially advanced in the calling in
which he has been so successful. Mr. Bush
has for years been general agent In the
freight department of the Santa Fe Com
pany in this city, but has tendered his
resignation of the position, to take ef
fect on August 1. if necessary arrange
ments can be made to admit of his depar
ture at that time without inconveniencing
the company. Mr. Bush's new position
will be that "of general agent for the Pa
cific Coast of the Colorado Midland Rail
way.
This line has been purchased jointly by
the Colorado and Southern and the Rio
Grande Western, both strong companies,
and it is intended that in future it shall
be an important factor in the distribution
of transcontinental traffic. In order to
be thoroughly "in the swim," the Colorado
Midland will open general offices In this
citv, over which Mr. Bush will preside
and it is a safe prediction that he will
see to it that his line gets an honest share
of the business. â¢'"â¢'?vi
Mr. Bush's long and varied career in the
railroad service of the coast makes him
an exceptionally strong man for the com-
pany that has employed him, and the offi
cials of the Midland are to be congratu
lated upon having added him to their al
ready distinguished staff. The gentleman
has been In the railroad business since
boyhood, beginning the life at Erie, Pa.,
on the Kmplre Fast Freight, In the early
'70's. Later he went to Denver and joined
the Rio Grande Railway Company, for
which he filled many Important positions.
His first experience on this coast was with
the original Transcontinental Freight As
sociation, when George W. Ristine was
commissioner. Just before that associa
tion went to pieces Mr. Bush entered the
employ of the Atlantic and Pacific fast
freight line as secretary to W. A. Bls
sell, then general agent. Afterward he
served as general agent, general freight
a.gent and assistant general freight and
passenger agent of the Atlantic and Pa
cific Railroad.
During the past six years Mr. Bush
has auiy filled the position of general
agent of the freight department of the
Santa Fe lines west of Albuquerque. He
is well known to railroad men throughout
the United States, and is generally con
ceded to be one of the brightest and best
informed men in the matter of freights
on the Pacific Coast. Furthermore, he is
one of the most popular men In the busi
ness. Mr. Bush's successor has not been
named.

Tennis Tournament.
H. I. Foster Springs a Surprise at
BROOKL.INE, Mass., July 23.â The qual
ity of tennis played at the tenth annual
tournament for the Longwood cup to-day
was high. Wrenn and "Ward and Lamed
and Allen played five set matches, full of
sharp rallies. Ward played the more bril
liant In his match, smashing and lobbing
beautifully. This style of game, however,
could not "win against Wrenn's steadiness.
Allen's strong point was cross-court
drives from the forehand.
The great surprise was the defeat of
Sumner Hardy by H. I. Foster. Hardy is
a Callfornian and was considered equal to
the best players in the East. To-day,
however, Foster clearly outplaj'ed him,
scoring many more played strokes. Foster
repeated the surprise by winning from
Paret in straight sets. Summary:

Peck Entertains Athletes.
PARIS, July 23.â Commissioner General
Peck entertained at dinner to-night the
American athletes who contested in the
world amateur championship contests in
connection with the Paris Exposition.
United States Kmbassador Porter, COhsul
General Gowdy and many other guegts
were present. Several speeches were
made, all emphasizing the great success
of the American competitors.
thing but pay and uniform. He is ap
pointed from the body of the department,
and under the present regime his old
place is held for him so that if he is not
suited to the place he can be sent back
to where he came from. He is allowed io
! wear the uniform of a captain because he
i gets a captain's pav. but his is only a
brevet rank â a shadow, riot a substance.
Sergeant Green baa held the place as
j property clerk since the opening of the
I new regime. He has been a steady, efii
! cient c.erli. and Ions before Captain Mo
Â¦ ran. the former clerk, was retired John
i Green was known as the man for his
place. He was with Moran for years, and
Moran had for him the hichest praise.
Besides, he is an old and efficient police
man, and his training has been on thÂ»
! brats and among the people.
He was told yesterday that Esola was
' to succeed him on the first of the month.
, lie was told that his w-ork was satisfac
! torv in every way, but that' the change
had" to be made. He was given to under
. stand that it was forced upon the depart
> ment. and that if the K.Â«ola ambition were
: not so unbounded he himself would be
] the man for the place. But all of this
; was cold comfort, for as property clerk
I Green receives $20) a month, and as a ser-
I g-eant on duty in the property clerk's of
| lice he groes J;ack to $125. Hut Ksola gets
; ralpcd from SIM to 1200. and is correspend
: ingly happy. In speaking of the change
i Chief Sullivan said only:
"The position is one that should be filled.
' according to the charter, from the grade
'Â¦Â¦ next below, and while the rank is not
I that of an actual captain, still it is above
> that of a lieutenant. Green has held the
; position and has filled it satisfactorily,
lÂ»ut he has been onlyÂ» acting property
I clerk, and it is necessary to appoint a
! permanent one. The position is not a per
'Â¦ manent one. however, unless it be properly
; Silled. In the appointments of a chief
'â¢ clerk and a property clerk, both of whom
are brevet captains, I- have retained their
; old positions in the department for the
, appointees, and if the positions be not
i properly tilled the appointees must go
; back to their former rank. E-sola is one
i of the senior lieutenant? and so is among
those first entitled to it."
It is a big price the old and efficient men
of the Police Department are paying for
the election of Phelan.
SEEGEANT JOHN GEEEN".
The idea of putting Escla in the prop
erty clerk's offlca is not a new one, but
Esola has held off because he wisJied to
be ma<!c a line captain. The difference is
apparent when it ir understood that the
property clerk Is not a captain in any-
The property clerk's position is one of
the plum* <if ihf- department, although no
sinecure. It is a desirable position be
cause it I* well paid, but heretofore it has
Â¦lways been in the hands of a man com
j.et.'iit both M a cleric and as a police of
lict r. The change will be a complete one.
To the rank and file of the department
the charge is a startling one, as it will
remove from authority a man who has
been identified for years as an active and
efficient property clerk. The position is
perhaps the most responsible routine one
in the department, as it involves the cus
tody of money and effects of great value.
For yeam Sergeant John Green has been
nctive property clrjk <.f the department.
He understands every element of the in
vr.hi-.i duties of the position, and the
greatest surprise will be created by his
E-tbordin&tion to Bsola, who has had no

powers from dismembering the Chinese
Empire after the conclusion of existing
troubles, is not correct," said the Min
ister. â¢"! am here solely In the capacity
oi Japanese Minister to the United States
to 1111 a vacancy. My Government deemed
it very necessary in these troublous times
that the position of .Minister snould oe
tilled. Hence niy presence here. So far
as 1 know, conditions have not developed
that would call for such a proposition
from Japan.
"1 cannot say that there was excitement
in my country when 1 left, as a result of
the Chinese complications, but there waa
a certain anxiety as to tne final solution
of the troubles. I am not prepared to say
that there has been any reliable news
received from China witb reference to the
turmoil in _ J eKing. In fact, 1 distrust
tne alleged news that has been made pub
lic. The Japanese Government is not dis
posed to believe that the Chinese Govern
ment was cognizant of the existence of
the conditions that led up to the dreadful
atrocities that have recently shocked the
civilired world. In my opinion, it will be
found when these troubles are at an end
that the intentions of the Boxers were
unknown to the Imperial Government, and
that when the outureak came It was Im
possible to promptly suppress it.
"I understand that it was rumored in
the dispatches that Japan was slow in
forwarding troops because of a lack of
funds. This statement was incorrect. We
took the steps we deemed proper at the
time. In the lirst place, at the beginning
of the outbreak there was not a sufficient
number of marines on the warships avail
nble to quell the disturbances, and when
the time had been taken to gather a for
midable force It was too iate. 1 have
studied the situation in China as to these
present troubles, and am free to say that
1 think these outbreaks are and will be
confined to the provinces of Chili and
i Shantung. 1 would be surprised if the
disturbances extended to the southern
provinces, as there is no particular sym
pathy between the two sections of the
country. It is a grave question to settle,
this matter of responsibility. The trouDles
have evidently been fostered by retractory
governors, whose operations were un
known to the Imperial government until
it was too late to prevent the horrible
outrages upon humanity that have oc
curred in that unhappy country.
"No; I do not anticipate a prolonged
state of anarchy in China. I believe it
will not be difficult to suppress the Boxers
! in the provinces named, and when that is
' done order can readily be restored. At the
' same time r realize that nothing can ap
i pea?e the wrath of the nations, resulting
! from the slaughter of their countrymen,
j but I hope and believe that the matters,
will be adiusted in China at an earlier
date than the world in general anticipates.
"The Interruption of the movement of
i commerce between America and China
will naturallv swell the volume of busi
ness between* this country and Japan and
! I think the development will be lasting.
I Ten years ago. when I was Consul Gen
! eral at New York, we sold the people of
the United States much more than we
bought from them, but now the balance
of trade is about even. Furthermore, it
appears to me that there will be a steady
increase in favor of the United States by
reason of the fact that there is a rapidly
growing _emand for the manufactured
products of this country in my native
land."

prominent diplomats of the Japanese em

position. He has been Minister to Hol

Joe Gans Issues a Challenge and De

NEW YORK. July 23.â Joe Gans, the
Baltimore lightweight, to-day deposited
with James J. Corbett $1000 to bind a
match with Frank Erne of Buffalo for
the lightweight championship, Gans not
being satisfied with the last meeting. :
"If Erne will not accept this chal
lenge," said Gans' manager. "I will let
this thousand go as a forfeit for a match
with Terry McGovern and will agree to
the same terms as the Erne-McGovern
matchâ that is, that Gans will agree to
stop McGovern in ten rounds. If not, Mc-
Govern is to get the decision. The only
concessions I ask is that McGovern allow
Gans to weigh in at the lightweight limit."

Rayhill Suit Decided.
â¢ The controversy between William Rav
hlll and his wife Margaret over a livery
stable on Haight street, between Steiner
and Pierce, was, decided by .Judge Sea
well yesterday. The contest over the
property is preliminary to divorce pro
ceedings which will be-in court within a
few weeks. Judge Seawell found that
Mrs. Rayhill had put $4700 Into the estab

$1800. He directed that the property be
sold according to law and the proceeds
divided between the litigants at the ratio
of their interest as shown by the amount
invested by each.
Phenomenal Increase of Students at
Princeton.
The University authorities' at Prince

cants for examination in the various
?iarts of the country to date. They are as
ollows:
Full entrance freshmen
Preliminaries ; 3,",3
Upper classes n
Total number examined 7*5
This is by far the largest number of
applicants they have ever had at Prince
ton, and should make the freshman class
about 400 next fall. These figures do not
include the large number of post-grad
uates, both from Princeton and other in
stitutions, who will be registered in the
autumn. Neither do they include the sev
eral hundred students in the theological
seminary at Princeton, which is a dis

Assault Made by Drunken Man
i Causes Tear of Other At
tempts at Violence.
James F. Tynan, alias James Canavan,
was sent to the County Jail for thirty
days by Judge Cabaniss yesterday on the
charge of battery. Tynan while drunk
Saturday started out to kill all the Boxers
in Chinatown. He knocked down two
Chinese merchants who were standing in
front of 723 Clay street. The Judge said
that the actions of such men as Tynan
were apt to breed a riot and must not be
tolerated. Tynan was dishonorably dis
charged from the Fortieth Infantry after
serving a term on Alcatraz.
After Tynan^had been sentenced Dong
Tvng, the Chinaman who is emploved to
examine all Chinese bonds in the courts,
called upon Chief Sullivan and said that
Chinese merchants were afraid that they
might be attacked in view of the Boxer
atrocities in China. He asked that they
be afforded police protection. Tho Chief
told him that there need be no alarm, as
every protection would be given law-abid
ing Chinese.

Depositions From England Are Ready
for Submission, but Counsel
Secured a Stay.
Julian Biddulph Arnold, son of Sir Ed
win Arnold, was before United States
Commissioner Heacock yesterday on a
new charge. The complaint, sworn to
by British Vice Consul Moore, charged
him with embezzling a sum equivalent to
$1775 In gold from William O. Swain and
Edgar Swain of England, heirs of an
English estate. Arnold's wife was in
court. Vice Consul Moore was also there
with a set 6f depositions, which were not
put in evidence. Arnold was represented
by Bert Schleslnger and the Vice Consul
was represented by Mr. Cormac. of Cor
mac, Donohoe & Baum. Attorney Schles
inger objected to everything and when
he was overruled, took exceptions. He
asked for and secured a continuance for
two weeks. Various papers were read,
under objection, among them a communi
cation from the British Embassador at
Washington and the British Consul Gen
eral at Chicago. Upon the showing that
the dates in them barred the supposition
that they could apply to any but the
earlier case, they were withdrawn.
George W. Hazen identified Arnold and
Vice Consul Moore testified that he had
proceeded under instructions from Min
ister Pauncefote in swearing out the
complaint upon which Arnold had been
rearrested. At this point in the proceed
ings Mr. Schlesinger asked for a contin
uance for one month and said that he
wished to produce depositions and other
papers which were on the way from Eng
land. Commissioner Heacock would not
grant a delay of a month, but named
August 6 as the date for the hearing of
testimony.

Masuji Miyakawa, the Japanese
charged with extortion who failed to ap
pear in Judpre Conlan's court Saturday,
was in attendance yesterday morning.
He explained that he had been busy Sat

paper published here.
"The defendant's bonds," said the
Judge, "are not sufficient and he is order
ed into custody. Perhaps he will tell the
truth and we will see if that rascal Kane
is not the man who should be in custody.
1 have learned that as soon as the de
fendant left this court Friday he went to
Kane, who was seen talking with him
in a doorway on Market street. If he
tells the truth I will reduce his bonds to
$5<tO."
"I will hold myself responsible for his
appearance." said ex-Judge Graham, "if
you will allow him to go till we can pro
cure other bonds."
The Judsre declined and Graham asked
if Kane .siill had his star. Chief Sullivan,
who was in court, said:
"I don't know. I suppose he has."
"Well, he shouldn't have it." said the>
Judge. "It is a most palpable disgrace
to allow a man like him to wear a star,
lie has apparently been advising this de
fendant to keep a stiff upp>* lip and not
tell the truth. If Miyakawa will only tell
the truth I can almost promise him im
munity from punishment.'* ."'-â¢â¢

BUREAU OF STREETS
REPORTS ON TRACKS
GENERAL JOHN CORSON SMITH,
ex-Lieutenant Governor and ex-
Treasurer of, Illinois, arrived in
this city from Chicago yesterday.
He is accompanied by his wife and will
soj&urn for several weeks In California.
General Smith commanded the Ninety
sixth Regiment, Illinois Infantry Volun
teers, in several of the memorable battles
of the Civil War. He participated In the
great conflict at Chickamauga. He gained
distinction also in the Atlanta" campaign,
and was wounded at Kenesaw Mountain.
General Smith is a prominent leader in
the Masonic fraternity, having attained
the rank of past grand commander,
Knights Templar of Illinois. He has trav
eled extensively throughout the Â¦world
since 1890, and the accounts of his jour
neys embraced in Masonic correspondence
are entertaining and instructive.
General Smith enjoyed the personal
friendship of the great leader, U. S.
Grant. He was a resident of Galena be
fore the war, when General Grant lived
there. In San Francisco General Smith
and wife are the guests of Major and Mrs.
William O. Gould.
Reuben H. Lloyd will give a dinner in
the red room of the Bohemian Club to
morrow evening in compliment to Gen
eral Smith.
,The Toyo Kaisen Kaisha's steamer
America Maru arrived from Chinese and
Japanese ports via Honolulu yesterday
morning, two days ahead of time. She
made the run from the last named port in
five days eighteen hours. Among the
passengers who came up on the steamer
were: W. Araki, Mr. von Bohl, Rev. Jo
seph Cosand. ?4rs. Cosand, Carl Francke,
Frank Gillett, Captain T. Kitahoga, Mrs.
George Mackinnon, W. E. Miles, Mrs. S.
J. Milliken, T. Minami, J. Selles, S. Toga,
Miss I. Watson, F. Yamada, Mrs. K.
Iakahira, George Tyson, Gerald Torrens,
B. Ashimori, W. Cartwrlght, George K.
Denny, Miss Calla Frazier, Alberto
Frank. Mrs. W. S. Jackson. Y. Matsuo,
Miss T. Mitani, Miss Milliken, Miss Uobe
chl, H. M. Richards, C. Shibutani. Com
mander S. W. Very, U. S. N., Miss F.
Woodall. the Hon. K. Takahlra and valet,
Mrs. Claude Whitney and maid. There
were in addition forty-three Japanese and
fifty-two Chinese steerage passengers,
and fourteen Europeans in the steerage.
Mrs. Mackinnon is the wife of the well
known master in the Mail Company's ser
vice. W. Cartwrlght was formerly in the
customs service at Tientsin and Shanghai,
but left the former place long before the
trouble broke out.
The America Maru brought over $250,000
in gold. Two days out from Yokohama
she ran into a westerly gale with a
heavy following sea. which made it very
uncomfortable aboard for a few hours.
News of the Transports.
British Ships in Collision.
Uncle Sam has chartered the transport
Siam for six months. She will make one
more trip to Nanaimo for coal and will
then be fitted out to carry horses and fod
der to China. The Slam was for quite a
while in the Manila trade and had an un
fortunate experience on her first trip. She
was caught in a typhoon and nearly every
one of the cattle was killed.
The transport Hancock will sail next
Sunday for the Orient. The chances are
that she will not go any farther than
Nagasaki. She will there land her troops
and another vessel will take them on to
China. This means that Uncle Sam will
inaugurate a regular service between San
Francisco, Nagasaki and Taku. Two ves
sels, probably the Hancock and Meade,
will run between here and Nagasaki,
while two more, probably the Indiana and
Warren, will run between Nagasaki and
Chinese ports. The Hancock docked yes
terday morning and the work of getting
her ready to sail was begun at once.
The transport Warren sailed from Nag
asaki on July 16 and the Logan on July
17, both for San Francisco. It was the in
tention of the Government to send the Lo
gan back to China, but she got nway from
Nagasaki before the orders arrived. The
Warren should reach here about August 2
and the Logan about thirty-six hours
later. Both vessels will be given a hur
ried overhauling and wilrget away again
about August 15 or 16.
The British ships Champion and Lord
Kinnaird were in collision off the South
American coast some time in June last,
but the news only reached here from
London yesterday. Both vessels reached
Antofogasta in a badly disabled condition.
The Champion sailed from Port Hadlock
on April 21 for Antofogasta in charge of
Captain Jones. From that point she was
to bring a cargo of nitrate to San Fran
cisco. The Lord Kinniard sailed from
Newcastle. Aus., on April 1 for Antofo
gasta in charge of Captain Mutch. From
that port she also was coming to San
Francisco with nitrate. The Champion
had for a cargo 1.070,130 feet of lumber,
and the Lord Kinniard carried about 1500
tons of coal. A telegram to the Mer
chants' Exchange states that both vessels
are almost wrecks and that it will take
months to repair them. This Is bad news
for the powder makers, who never wanted
nitrate worse than, they do now.
Water Front Notes.
The British ship "Windsor Park sailed
for Europe with a cargo of wheat yester
day. Captain Lambie's friends were out
in force to bid him good-by. This was
the genial master's first visit to San Fran
cisco, but he has left many kir.dly memo
ries behind him and will receive a warm
welcome on his return.
Boats were out looking for the remains
of Ernest Gueldner and his 8-year-old ssn,
who were drowned off Lime Point last
Sunday. A diligent search of all the coves
between Lime Point and YVhalehead was
made, but the chances are that the bodies
were carried out to sea.
A libel was filed in the United States
District Court yesterday against the
schooner S. E. Perry, by H. P. Anderson,
who claims $122 due him in wages and
materials. " .

The Popham colony in the Kennebec In
1607 was the only serious attempt the Plym
outh company ever made to settle the
new world and It was a fiasco. A stronger
sentiment than the love of gain, a nobler
passion than the spirit of adventure, had
first to be invoked before a lasting im
pression could be made on New England's
rockbound coast. Better men than the
miscalled "gentlemen" who quarreled and
starved and died of fever in the early days
of Jamestown were required in the far I
north. And England was well sifted to |
find them.
England was still in the after-travall of
the reformation. Some of her good Chris
tians were fdr sweeping all the good as
well as evil from the church. They want
ed to make all things new; to simplify the
government of the. church and drop her
ceremonies. To purge and purify was
their intent and so they got the name
of Puritans. Despairing of achieving their j
whole purpose some of. them made up
their minds to leave the mother church
and shift as best they could without her.
Scrooby, near the edge of Lincoln, was
the rendezvous of the most zealous of
these separatists, as men called them. I
Thence in 1608, in order to escape the
persecution growing every year more
serious and intolerable, they fled in ai

Standish was one of five, but an alto
gether worthy one. His work as "Rash

of the talents of his peers and the un

It was the sword of Standish that saved
the rest from the red hand of hostile In

new experiment, prompted by new
motives, to colonize the new world.
But Standish was not one of the pi.
grims. His history had been quite dif

the first ten years a great improvement
on the Scrooby days. They were well
treated; they had some influence.
But the work was very hard; some of the
younger folk could not resist the tempta

crowding out the English ways of
thought; and there were some dread
symptoms of the ultimate extinction of
the English tongue. Good Englishmen
still though no longer churchmen, they
were indeed alarmed. It was better far.

charter. But he showed sufficient interest
to inquire into their plan and to approve
it in the words. "It was a good and hon
est notion." Informed that they proposed
to make a living by "fishing" he remarked
with patronizing nonchalance, "So God
have my soul; so God have my soul; 'tis
an honest trade; 'twas the apostles' own
calling."
After many mishaps the pilgrims were
off, a hundred of them all told, Septem
ber 16. 1620, from Plymouth, England, in
the stanch Mayflower, which seemed to
them' quite small, but to us. .who hear of
the countless bits of furniture brought
over in it. seems as large as the Oceanic
or its prototype, the Great Eastern. They
had a stormy voyage and it was not until
and made the acquaintance of the pil
grims. It should always be remembered
that not for gain, nor from necessity,
nor even from religious zeal, but for
friendship's sake and because there w,n
a knightly spirit in his blood, he forsook
home and heritage, put away ambition
and the love of glory, to be the "flashir.-c
sword" to the pilgrims and "the Great
heart of their pilgrimage to the city that
they sought," but never found till life
was done and they were laid to rest on
Burial Hill. He shared their trouble*:
there were no joys to share. He. as well
as Bradford, lost his wife in those first
days, and though Longfellow and Jano
Austen describe in words no reader en a
forget his vicarious proposal to PriscIHa.
there was no sentiment for him in the
transaction. Bradford, one may well be
lieve, convinced him that it was his
solemn duty to take a share in keeplns
up by marriage the population of a col
ony which had lost half its members thr>
first winter. He was one among equals
until the menacing savages obliged tha
pilgrims to resolve themselves Into a mil
itary bodv and train daily in the use of
arms and tactics of defense. Then Stand
ish became at once the first among hi=j
equals, and right royally he did his work
as commander in chief of a little army,
sometimes numbering only six. but al
ways brave and confident.
He did not spend quite all his life in
warfare. In Ifi25 he visited England as
agent for the colony, returning with sup-
plies the following year. In 1(CS he rude
ly interfered with the dangerous doings
at Merrymount and dispersed Morton's
thriftless rabble picked up from the Lon
don streets. He -was one of the original
settlers and proprietors of Duxbury.
which he named In honor of his ancestral
home and within the boundaries of whicli
he was doubtless buried In 165S.

November 21 that they rounded "the bared
and bended arm of Massachusetts." to
which Gosnold, who made harbor here in
1602 gave the name of Cape Cod. Here,
oft 'the present Provincetown, they cast
anchor, inaugurated the first New Eng
land Monday by a grand washing on the
beach, explored the country near, signed
the famous compact of government, lost
several of their company by death and
added to their number the first white boy
born on New England soilâ little Pere
grine White, who then began his earthly
peregrinations.
December 21 they landed on a spot
which John Smith had visited some five
vears before and set do'wn on his map as
Plymouth. The place invited them to
stay and settle. It seemed to be easily
prepared for raising crops and no Indians
were near. A pestilence had swept the
natives off awhile before. Samoset. the
only Indian surviving, showed a friendly
spirit and taught the pilgrims how to
wring subsistence from the barren soil
and icy sea. Massasoit, the noble but sad
hearted'Indian Regulus. who had seen his
tribe reduced from 30,000 souls to a few
hundred by the pestilence, made a treaty
with them which he never broke. Other
Englishmen, who had preceded or who I
later settled near, were not so wise in |
treatment of the Indians, and tbe pil
grims were in consequence hard pressed
at times to maintain their prestige and
prevent a general massacre. The central
figure in the work that saved the settle
ment from destruction by the Indians in
those early days was the captain of the 1
company. Myles Standish. j

GENERAL JOHN C. SMITH.
THEODORE BRAKKE, who was left
in charge of the Bon Ton saloon, at
the corner of Pine and Dupont
streets, while its proprietor was in
Europe, mysteriously disapnpared
some weeks agro, leaving a large number
of unpaid debts and a locked safe. The
manager's deficiencies will not be made
known until the proprietor returns from
Europe, but from the fast pace he had
been keeping up in the tenderloin district
for some months previous to his depar
ture it is thought that the proprietor of
the place may not feel happy when he
learns all.
Axel Johnson, the proprietor of the
saloon, left this city four months ago
His business was very-prosperous on ac
count of its location, and he left con
siderable money in the safe. Brakke was
placed in charge, and immediately after
his employer's departure commenced to
spend large sums of coinfln the tender
loin district. On July 9 he disappeared,
after having- fixed the safe so that it
could not be opened. He also left bills to
the amount of several hundred dollars,
which he was supposed to have paid.
These bills were for liquors, cigars, rent
and insurance.
John Sundberg assumed charge of the
place and notified Johnson. The cash
register was found to be empty, but. as
Brakke had taken the key with him, it
could not be ascertained, how much it
should contain. Sundberg will not at
temp to opfen the safe -until the proprie
tor's return. The police at the California
street station were notified several nights
ago of the supposed embezzler's depar
ture, but they can take no action until
a ontnnlalnt is SWOm to. .â¢*''?.' r- U

DOCTOR'S FOOD TALK.
Selection of Food One of the Most
Important Acts in Life.
Old Dr. Hanaford of Reading, Mass.,
says in the "Messenger": "Our health
and physical nnd mental happiness are
so largely under our personal control
that the proper selection of food should
be, and is, one of the most important
acts in life.
"On this subject I may say that I
know of no food equal in digestibility
fend more powerful in point of nutriment
than th^ modern Grape- Xuts, four heap-
ing teaspoons of which is sufficient for
the cereal part of a meal, and experience
demonstiates that the user is perfectly
nourished from one meal to another.
"I am convinced that the extensive
and g-eneral use of hig-h class foods of
this character would increase the term of
human life, add to the sum total of hap-
piness and very considerably improve
society in general, i am free to men-
tion the food, for I personally know of
its value."
Grape-Xms food can be used by babes
in arms, or adults. It is ready cooked,
can be served instantly, either cold with
cream, or with hot water or hot milk '
poured over. All sorts of puddings and
: zr\cy dishes can be made with Grape-
*Cuts. The food is concentrated and
very economical, for four heaping tea-
spoons are sufficient for the cereal part

Outlook for Wheat.
A Chicago circular gives the following out
look for Wheat:
â¢ 'Government weekly weather and crop bul
letin says ell vegetation in North Dakota ira
jiroved since the rain 'except Wheat, whose
jr cneral condition ha? not improved.' In South
Dakota. 'Wheat has improved except where
previously worthless. promising good yie:d
<'nly in extreme southwestern counties. In
Minnesota. 'Wheat much improved on acre
age remaining.' Special from Taooraa in to
dav's Chicago Record from State Grain Cor.i
m;VsionÂ«rr says. -Ei-timated yield for State will
have to be cut down as fields expected to
vield 30 to 35 bushels are turning out
2V Portland, Or., advices state that con
servative curators will be satisfied with
a 41.000.00 bushf-I aggrefcate yield in
Oregon, Washington and Idaho. The Win
nipeg Commercial of the 14th inst. says. "Rains
came too late to ir.sare a good crop and v.-e
cannot improve on our previous estimate.'
Reports to railroads show no Improvement in
e-ome parts of Manitoba, while In others the
rair.s are thought to have added two bushels
j.er acre.
"In TmufWM farmer* threshed their Whect
from w*t sheaves and are now unable to sell
the <5anr;\ tough grain except at a great dis
count, 4'.c being paid for same of it. while
pood Wheat brings 74c. On reduced world's
exports the amount on ocean passage has de
clined from 42.fÂ«X>.000 bushels April 23 to 29.-
OKi.OOO bushels now. The movement yetterday,
showing total receipts of Wheat at primary
rr.arkets. seaboard and gulf ports 5*1.000 bush
els a*rains=t l.S21.<*>0 bushels same day la-st
year, is an Indication of the showing that will
6oon be made in our own storks, In compari
son with former pea^or.s. Little Wheat is no<v
l*-ir.g received anywhere except at Kansas
City and St. Louis. The visible promises to <:Â¦Â¦
crease Ftea4ily. contrasting forcibly with the
urual liberal increase in former seasons. The
outlook is extremely bullish, but may not be

CHICAGO, July 23.â Wheat was a very tame
market to-day. Liverpool showed practical
ly no response to the advance here Saturday
and world's shipments were large, showing
good increases from Russia and the Danub'an
country- September opened J /4Slc under Sat
urday. There was some covering by shorts
for profits, a little buying by traders follow
ing this and September rallied to 78%c. The
rally which traders were playing for failed
to materialize because of outside sympathy
and a reaction followed. Heavy receipts and
a very slack cash business during the re-<* cf
the session held the market true to the down
ward course and the windup was lifeless and
weak. September dropped to 76%ic and closed
l%c lower at 78*iig 76 7 sc. Corn was quiet but
steady, holding firmly, against the weakness
in Wheat after it had made a small concession
to the attitude assumed by the more import
ant cereal. September closed up at 39Vi
(S39Â»ic. Oats were dull. September closed s ic
under Saturday at 23Hc Provisions opened
nrm on light Hog receipts and an advance
at the yards. Trade wan dull, however. Hogs
turned easier; there was no export demand
and the Wheat weakness was depressing, all
of which cost the Hog product market its
early sr.lu and more, too. September closed
22Vfcc unior Saturday, Lard 5c down and Ribs
Sc lower.

Mrs. Sarah Freeman has reopened hos
tilities against her former husband.
Thomas B. Freeman, in her efforts to se
cure alimony from him. Through her at
torney to-day she refused to compromise
her claim for $10 a month instead of $20, as
the court directed when the decree of di
vorce was granted. This put an end to
the temporary truce which was declared
the other day, when Freeman expressed
his willingness to pay $10 a month ali
mony. .
Mrs. Eva Bryson, Â¦who is charged by
Mrs.- Freeman with being the recipient of
attentions from Freeman, was called as a
witness. She testified that she was a
friend of Freeman and had advanced him

Franklin streets. She had taken in part
payment two wagons which Mrs. Free
man had sought to attach.
Freeman oiiered to transfer to his ex
wife the outstanding bills that were owing
to him if she would leave him alone so
that he could attend to his business.
Judge Greene continued the contempt
proceedings until to-morrow. He said he
did not wish to punish Freeman, as he
appeared disposed to do what was right.

The Board of Public Works to-day
adopted a lengthy report on the dredging
of Lake Merritt. which has been the sub
ject of criticism. The report was re
quested by the City Council and was pre
pared and submitted to the legislative de
partment in accordance with that re
quest.
The history of the preliminary proceed
ings with relation to the dredging as set
forth in this report shows that in 1S9S the
City Council passed an ordinance which
seemed to appropriate JSO.000 for dredging
Lake Merritt to a uniform depth of four
feet at ordinary high tide, and for build
ing permanent tidal sates in the Twelfth
street dam. The report says:
This ordinance also authorized thÂ» Board of
Public Works to enter Into contracts to have
the wtTrk performed. The Council was gTild^d
by the Judgment of citizens as to the probable
cost of these two pieces of work. No estimate
of the cost was ma<le by any officer of the city.
On November 1. 1S98, the Council, by an ordi
nance fixing the tax rate f..r the year JfM-Â»Â».
apportioned the levy so as to raise *<S3.3oÂ« fnr
the dredglnjf of Lake Merritt and fnr the build-
Ing of permanent gates In the Twelfth-street
dam. and not $80,000. as it would seem was
contemplated by the Council In the previous
month of August, and of the $63,300 finally pro
vided, the sum of J5.**2 was use.l between De
cember. 189S. and November. W9, for purposes
other than dredRln*? Lake Merritt. leaving only
S07.77S of the JSO.COO contemplated by the
original ordinance for the Improvement of the
lake.
A contract was let by the former Board
of Public Works for dredging the lake,
but the Superior Court annulled that con
tract. The present board let a new one
with specifications written to conform to
the opinion of the_court.
The specification in controversy Is as
follows:
To dredge and remove all mud from the Lake
not hitherto dredged t<> a uniform depth of four
f*et twlow ordinary hlth tide; mud to be de
posited between Kighth and Twflfth Â»treetÂ». for
the sum of $1S.SO<). but permlttlne 120.0*10 cubic
yards to be placed in northeastern and north
western arms of the lake at a rebate of 10
cents per cubic yard (rebate allowed on this
contract $12,000).
The report upon this Item declares as
follows:
While contract five wai in process It was con
clude.! by the Board of Public Works. Inform
ally that because the north and east arms of
the lake would undoubtedly fill rapidly with
debris during the winter season, these
arms mlsht profitably be dredged to a rreater
depth than four feet, as provided for In the
original contract, and that mud bo dredged
should be credited to the contractor aÂ» though
it had been dredged from the center of the lake,
which portion was found not to have shoaled to
any great extent for twenty years, and is now
at ordinary hien tide covered with from three
to four feet of water, as shown by the City En
gineer's map.
The Hoard of Public Works became convinced
that the removal of the few inches of mud
that might under this contract be dredged from
the center of the lake would be of less benefit
to the city than the dredKingr of the arms of
the lake to a greater depth than four feet at
the present time. And furthermore, calcula
tions by the City Knelneer shqwed that the
number of cubic yards that might be taken
from the center of the lake to deepen the Ham*
to four feet would not raise the park area be
tween Twelfth and Eighth streets more than
two feet of the eieht feet necessary to raise
this area to the desirable level of the Elghth
street brldce. And the board concluded also
that additional dredging of the lake would hare
to be done hereafter In order to fill the park
area referred to. and that the only portion of
the lake mud that could be used for this pur
pose without great expense would necessarily
be the central portion. an<\ for this reason, as
well as for the first reason given, the Board of
Public Works permitted the contractor to
dredge the arms of the lake tf> five and five Â«nd
one-half feet, and not to dredge the few inches
of mud from the center of the lake.
The report also shows that the contract
required that the dredglngs be placed in
the northeastern and northwestern arms
of the lake and in the flat between Eighth
and Twelfth streets.

Be More Cheaply
Made.

young women to answer their "helloa."

some splendid targets for his love-coated

Suffocated to death in smoke from a
blaze started while playing with matches
this afternoon was the fate of little 5
year-old Leo O'Connor, the eldest child
of Mr. and Mrs. John J. O'Connor, resid
ing at S35 Seventeenth street.
The child was Imprisoned by the flames
he had caused in the basement of the
little cottage where he had been playing.
When the firemen arrived In response to
an alarm the smoke was so dense that
they were driven back time and again
while trying to tight their way into the
cellar. Assistant Chief Lawton made four
attempts to crawl through the black wall
of smoke that filled the basement, but was
nearly overcome each time. After win
dows had been smashed and apertures cut
through the boarding, enough smoke was
released to permit an entrance. William
Baccus. cxtraman of Kngine Company Xo.
2, climbed In and found the child on the
floor near the front of the basement,
where he had run to escape from the
flames.
The rear door was opened, but the lit
tle one't- exit was cut off by the lire,
which spread very fast over a pile of
j straw and otner material which had been
, set ablaze.
The child was taken upstairs and a
physician was called while the firemen
were lighting to save the house from de
struction. Hut the little sufferer only
lived a few minutes and at 6 o'clock was
dead. He was not burned, but had been
overcome by the .thick smoke.
The accident was one of the most dis
tressing ot incidents. Yesterday the fam
ily haa a celebration in honor of little
Leo's fifth birthday. This morning the
family cleaned house and the debris was
swept into the basement. It was this
which caused the boy's death.
. .other and father were both absent
when the fire occurred. The father was
at his tailoring shop at Fourth and Mar
ket streets. San Francisco. Mrs. O'Con
nor was away on a shopping tour. Her
tieter. Mrs. J. Bowen, residing at lfel
Twelfth street, was caring for the chil
dren. Leo and two others, besides a baby
of her own. The youngfst O'Connor child
Is a three-weeks-old baby.
Leo managed to get some matches and
j slipped downstairs into the basement. All
' unawares, his aunt was sitting In a room
â¢ watching the younger childron. when the
I house suddenly filled with smoke. The
! crackling dames pave still more warning
: and the A frightfciiod woman rushed out,
; crying "T'ire." while she tried to get the
! children out. She dashed down Into the
' basement, but could not break through
; the flames which were burning fiercely
' across the rear. Then she tried to burst
through a window, but the heat and
'Â¦Â¦ smoke drove her back.
The firemen were barely at work before
; Mrs. O'Connor arrived home. Her child
had Just been dragged from the cellar,
; but she knew naught of what had oc
1 curred. ' Her first question was about the
babies. As gently as possible the news
was broken and the grief-stricken mother
; fainted.
The residence was damaged considera
bly by smoke. The fire was confined to
I the rear. Coroner Mehrmann took charge
, of the case.

The assessment of the franchise of the
Contra Costa Water Company was to-day
stricken from the assessment rolls of Ala
tneda County upon an opinion rendered by
Deputy District Attorney II. A. Melvin
that the franchise was assessable in the
county where the place of business of the
ccmpar.y was located. As the Contra
Costm Water Company has its principal
I'laet of business in Â£an Francisco the
(supervisors held that the franchise should
have been assessed there and struck the
assessment off the rolls.
Ihe. question of the assessment of the
franchise of this company has been pend
ing for some time. County Assessor Dal
lou took the position that a decision of
.Â¦jtige liu.ju ol sitcckton made it incum
bent upon County Assessors to assess
Uunchues in tne county where the cor
poration does Its business rather than In
ix. o county where it nominally had Its
oince ana place of business, ana ne placed

Company upon the rons ot tms county lor
*i..^o< .-.'Km. me amount tor wnich Assessor
L/OCgÂ« of fcan jr'tsincisco assessed it last
>c&r.
ihe Contra Costa Water Company op
posed tee assessment upon two groundsâ
i.rst, that tne franchise was not a valua-
L:e asset and tnouid not have been as
fcet-SL-a at an. as it was not an exclusive
right to do business, and second, that it
enouid have bftn assessed In ejan Kran
cisco. where trie company had its office.
Ihe matter was reterred to the District
Attorney and an opinion requested from
L:m. Deputy District Attorney Melvin
.,Â«>red me opinion th:s> morning. He
quoted the opinion of former District At
torney Snook, which held LtUCt a franchise
was assessable in the county where the
office or pnncinai piace ol business was
i.< ni.fi. t'toe opinion of Judge iiudd of
Stockton was rjuoted at length, the es
h'nee of which is contained in the follow
ing: "A (ranchlM is property subject to
taxation (constitution, article X11J. section
3>. and it must be assessed in the county
la which it is situated (constitution, arti
cle XIII. seection 10).** Mr. Melvin then
bays that there is a conflict between the
tijir.ior.s ol Jutigf- Kudo! of Stockton a.nd
mat of former District Attorney Snook.
He then quctf-s from a decision of the
bupreme Court in the case of the Spring
Valley Water Company agajnst Tax Col
lector Harbor of Alameda County, where
tlio Â»at'-r company Bought to prevent the
Tax Collector from selling its franchise
i'.; this county. The Supreme Court said:
"We think that whatever franchise the
appellant has com* 3 * from Its charter and
is as-s^psable at Han Francisco. Its prin
cipal place of business." Mr. Melvin then
Ears:
"The opinion of the Supreme Court, in
our estimation, supports tbo opinion of
J-jiisp Snook, hereinbefore cit^d. rendered
to your honorable body, and I can find no
decision modifying the opinion of Judge
Â£-nr>ok or no decision of th<' Supreme
Court authorizing the assessment in this
countv of the franchise of a water com
pany which has it^ principal place of busi
ness in another county."
The- board held another meeting this
afternoon and by a vote of four to one
struck the assessment from the rolls of
this county. Supervisor Mitchell was the
Dtlly one who voted to retain the asseses
tnpnt.

The lad's ascension was deemed remnrk

professional aeronauts use them secretly.
nut Master Tullett could not be pt-rsuaded
to ellow thorn to be fastened on him.
"There's no fear in me." declared the
youth who, despite his well-muscled
frame. Is yet a boy of tender years.
"I don't want to be bothered with those
things." he added, contemptuously kick

The youngster's fame Fpread. On the

Woodpeckers all use holes drilled out
with their strong bills, the chips making
the' lining. If you follow up a series of
round holes drilled in the decayed branch
of a. tree, you will usually come upon one
of these nests.
These birds waste much time and labor
bv drilling several holes before they find
one to suit their fancy. These holes, be
sides forming the nest in summer, answer
for a home in winter, though sometimes
the male bird drills a hole just large
enough for himself, and lets his mate
weather the winter storms as well as she
can.
The woodpeckers drill new holes for
nests each season, and the old ones are
quietly appropriated by the nut-hatches,
the chickadees and the brown creepers.
Each has her notions of refurnishing the
borrowed homes. The chickadees put
down a soft carpet or rusr of caterpillar
silk or spider webe, mixed with down from
plants. The nut-hatches are satisfied
with a mat of prass.
The Rreat crested flycatcher also uses a
convenient woodpeckers' hole, but not
finding it furnished to meet her fancy, she
upholsters it with the most curious mate
rial you could possibly guess. SnakeskinsI
How can a bird know where to find them?
Yet she does, and almost Invariably, In
every great-crested flycatcher's nest, you
will find one or more castoff snakesklns.
Wrens, swallows, bluebirds, owls, eagles
and some hawks, use last year's nest3
with some slight repairs, or appropriate
a deserted one that seems suitable.
A wren will rear a little family in a hole
in a tree that seems hardly large enough
for the mother bird. The bluebird and the i
martin will be thankful for any boxes :
nailed about the garden to assist them in
their housekeeping cares.
Bv far the larger proportion of our birds
build a new nest each season, though
often returning to the same locality.
Then comes that great army of birds that
build 'not only a ~Â«w nest each year, but
a new nest for each brood. â Vlck's Maga
zine.

Our T>oors Closed to the Mongoose.
The fiat of the nation has gone forth
against the mongoose. Before Congress
adjourned a bill was passed by both
houses prohibiting Us Importation. The
pugnacious little animal Is henceforth to
be placed in the same category as the
Chinese. -
The mongoose Is a native of India. It
is death on rats and anake3. For the de
struction it works among these pests it
is highly prized. But when it clears out
the rats and snakes it betakes itself to
birds and eggs and any sort of small
game it can- get hold of. That is why the
Department of Agriculture classifies it as
a noxious animal. Weighed in the bal
ance, away from its native land, its vices
are found to outweigh its virtues,^ and
therefore it is to be kept out of Uncle
Sam's broad domains.
Thus far very *lew specimens of the
mongoose have been introduced into this
country. The edict of exclusion is based
mainly on the experience of Jamaica,
That island once suffered from a plague
of rats, which were particularly destruc
tive in the cane fields. They were held
responsible for an annual loss of some
thing like $rwo,OOQ. In February. 1S72. nine
individuals of the mongoose, four males
and five females, were introduced from
India. .
They increased with remarkable rapid
ity and soon spread all over the island,
even to the tops of the highest mountains.
They proved inveterate rat destroyers. A
decade after their Introduction it was es
timated that thev were thus saving the
suear planters $223,000 per annum. And
the mongoose was blessed.
Still the mongoose increased, and its
murderous habits became more and more
apparent as the rats diminished. It de
stroyed young pigs, kids, lambs, > puppies,
kittens, poultry, game, birds which nest
ed on or near the ground, egga, ground
lizards, frogs, turtles' eggs and land
crabs. It was also known to eat ripe
bananas., pineapples, young corn, pears,
sweet ' potatoes, cocoanuts and other
fruits. Toward the close of the second
decade the mongoose came to be regarded
as the worst pest ever introduced into the
islandâ worse than the rats which It de
stroyed. Then the mongoose was officially
anathematized.
Hawaii, where the- mongoose was intro
duced in 1581. underwent a somewhat sim
ilar experience, and in 1892 a . law -was
passed forbidding the Introduction, breed
ing or keeping ofjthe mongoose on the
island.
All of which goea to show that the mon
goose'ls a good animal to let alone where
nature has-claced it.
"What time Is It?" asked a man who
was riding with a detective in a cab the
other day.
The detective pushed an almost invisible
lever on the side of the setting of a large
cameo ring that he wore on the third fin
ger of his left hand. Then he placed his
left hand at his left ear and listened for
"Seventeen minutes past 3," he replied
"Now you can go ahead and tell me
about that," said the man who was riding
with the detective. The man had watched
the detective's method of ascertaining the
time with interest. "I can see that big
ring of yours is a repeating watch, of
course. Let's. have the rest of it."
"This ring and repeating watch com
bined." said the detective, "belonged to
one of the most notorious of the swagger
gang of shortcard players who used to
work the ocean steamships. He's bee^
dead for ten years now, and as his family
are pretty good people, and one of hig sons
is an officer in the army out in the Philip
pines, I needn't mention his name. He
was the champion of his class, though.
"This card sharper had this ring I'm
wearing made in Switzerland for a pur
pose. He made many thousands of dollars
with it. His game was this way: When
a gang of men on one of the steamships
on which he was a passenger would get
together in the smoking-room or carrl
room and get to betting on the revolu
tions of the screw, on the weather, on the
day's voyage, on any old thing, he would
gently butt in with a crack to the effect
that there wasn't one man out of a hun
dred that could properly count off a min
uteâthat is, that could exactly, or any
thing like exactly, apprehend the passage
of sixty seconds. This would lean to a di3
cuseion, and the sharper would attempt
to prove his statement by reference to the
fact that few referees of prize-fights are
able to count ten seconds over a prostrate
fighter with anything like accuracy. Then
there'd be more chaw on this point, and
finally the sharper would suggest that all
hands present chip in a pool, say of $100
each; the whole bundle to be walked away
with by the man in the pool who could
count the nearest to a minute. The crowd
never failed to bite.
"He worked this trick once too often.
Oddly enough a Scotland Yard man got
next to the gag. Now Scotland Yard men
are, as a rule, pretty obtuse and opaque,
and aijw other thing? like that, but thi3
Scotland Yard man was an exception to
the rule, and he tumbled to the card
sharper's little stall. The Scotland Yard
detective was in a minute-guessing pool
for a Â£5 note himself, and the attitude of
the short-card man in counting off his
precise sixty seconds struck him as being
a bit peculiar. He didn't say anything
right then, but after the short-card man
had gone out. after gathering up the pool,
he mentioned his suspicions to a couple
of other passengers. When the short-card
E layer returned to the card cabin the
co'tland Yard man. sure that he was
right, walked up behind the sharper, who
was sitting down, and suddenly grabbed
his left wrist, saying:
" 'Let's have an inspection of that ring.
"The sharper promptly jumped to his
feet and knocked the Scotland Yard man
flat. The cat was out of the bag, how
ever, and all the men In the compartment,
who'd been, in the minute-guessing pool,
called upon the sharper to show up his
ring. With a very much aggrieved air the
shark pulled off the ring on his third
finger and threw it on the table, protest
ing in a dignified manner that they had no
right to doubt his integrity. When they'd
got through examining the ring without
finding anything unusual about it, he took
it back, laid it on the table again, got a
hammer and broke it open. It was just a
plain cameo ring, that was all, with no
works or anything else Inside it. This
sharper was a wise gazabo in his genera
tion, you see. and he had a duplicate â a3
iH.r as the outside went â of
along with him for just such an emer
gency. The Scotland Yard man got the
laugh, of course, and the shark was re
stored to the favor of all the men who'd
suspected him on the detective's say so,
and was able to pose before them as an
outraged man for tha remainder of the
voyage. But he never tried the game
again.
"This short-card man quit the steam
ers and. with a competency, led a square
life for some years previous to his cashing
in. When he was on his last bed he sent
for-'me â I'd known him for a lonpr while â
and handed me this ring. Said he didn't
want to leave his children any old ihinp
that had served him in his former life of
grafting. It's a fine bit of work and is
worth about $1000. I've worn it off and
on for a number of years now. No," con
cluded the detective, smiling'. "I haven't
done any business with it." â Chicago Inter

LARGE AMOUNT OF MILK
DUMPED INTO SEWERS
Health Board Inspectors Make An
other Raid on Venders of
Impure Article.
Health Officer Chalmers had six In
ppoctors out rarly Sunday morning to
hold up the milkmen, and the result was
that 303 gallons of impure milk was
dumped into the sewers. Dr. Chalmers
asserts that over 1000 gallons would have
Kone the same way if he had been per
mitted to employ enough men to cover the
territory. As it was it happened in many
Instances that when a cart was held up
there only remained one can of milk, and
that was almost invarlablv had.
The inspectors were Ktationod at the fol
lowing places: Fillmore street and Gold
en Gate avenue. Eddy and Mason streets.
Third and Mission streets, opposite the
County Jail on Broadway and at Pacific
and Buchanan streets. There was but a
short time in which to work, and the in
spectors had to do some pretty lively
hustling. In nearly every instance the
milk was found to be far below the
standard. Dr. Chalmers did not give out
the names of the derelict milkmen yester
day, but will do so. he says, if any of
them are caught a second time.
John Krrr, a haclcdriver. whose stand is
rear tho Mint, took a funeral party to the
San Mateo cemeteries ypst<?rday. The
horse he drove was of the crowbalt order,
and nothing but a liberal u.se of the whip
Â¦would make it move. Som^whore along

hausted. Kerr was arrested by Officers

The Thirty-ninth District Republican
Club held an enthusiastic meeting at
Saratoga Hall last night. President L. A.
Gibbons was in the chair and the hall
was crowded. Although the club was
organized less than a fortnight ago, there
are already 335 members on the roll. The
canvassing committee expects to more
than double that number during this week
and to see that every member is
registered.
The greatest harmony prevails in the
club. Although a fight is expected in the
district, no fears are entertained as to the
outcome. The kickers did not even make
an attempt to capture the organization.
The motto of the club is pure politics and
no bosses. The ottlcers are: L.. A. Gib
bons, president; E. G. Knapp, first vice
president; W. H. Bodfish, second vice
president; William McKenzle, treasurer,
and II. P. Goldstein, secretary.
F. A. Worth and T. H. McCarthy, lead
ing spirits of the club, impressed upon the
members last night the necessity of im
mediate registration for themselves and
their friends. They pointed out that the
interest of the voters in the district ought
to be awakened to the fact that there is
much at stake in the coming elections,
both national and local, and if the people
would have a clean, sound government
thoy must turn out and . help elect the
men who can give it. Last year the As
semblyman was lost through the indif
ference of the Republican voters, and this
yÂ«ar the office must be retained.
Several members of the club were nomi
nated" last night as delegates to the com
ing State, Congressional and municipal
conventions. It was decided to go out
side of the roll of the club if necessary to
secure representative business men of the
district to attend the conventions. The
matter was left in the hands of the execu
tive committee, with Instructions to report
a ll?t of delegates at the next meeting, to
be approved by the club. Following are
the working committees of the club:

memorandum of the fact.
Yesterday morning Attorneys Sullivan
& Sullivan called upon Judge Bahrs and
made an application on behalf of Mrs.
Ella F. Murray for special letters of ad
ministration upon the estate of Mrs.
Townsend. Judge Sullivan, who repre
sented Mrs. Murray, said she was the
daughter of the deceased and that special
letters should be issued, so that all per
ishable property and property demanding
Immediate attention might be cared for.
Judge Bahrs issued letters of administra
tion and made an order fixing the bond
of the administratrix at $5000. but made
the additional order that the estate -was to
remain in statu quo and that no property
was to be disposed of or negotiated unless
by special order of the court.
Latdr in the day M. C. Hassett, attor
ney for the Public Administrator, called
the attention of Judge Bahrs to the fact
thai a question had been raised an to the
authenticity of the claims of Mrs. Mur
ray. On this showing by Atorney Has
sett, the court ordered the' clerk to hold
the letters in abeyance until the court
had had an opportunity to investigate the
right of the petitioner for letters of spe
cial administration. In the interim Judge
Sullivan called upon Judge Bahrs and was
informed of the turn matters had taken
and of the information given him by Has
sett. Attorney Suliivan demanded of the
court an immediate investigation. Judge
Bahrs, in order to determine whether or
not his order directing the issuance of
the special letters was ill-advised, agreed
to accompany Sullivan, Mrs. Murray and
Miss Rattigan to the Savings and Loan
Society at the corner of Bush and Mont
gomery streets and open the vault of de
ceased for written proofs and to further
interview those whom Mrs. Murray re
ferred to as living witnesses to the truth
of her contentions.
Cyrus \V. Carmany, president of the
Savings and Loan Society, produced the
papers of the deceased. A thorough
search was made for a will, but none was
found. The box contained bonds and ne
gotiable securieties worth between $300,000
and $350,000. In answer to Judge Bahrs,
Carmany declared that he had known
Mrs. Murray since JS94, but that he be
lieved the lady to have been a sister of
the deceased. He further declared that
he had frequently forwarded money to
Mrs. Murray at the request of Mrs.
Townsend.
Then Mrs. Murray was questioned by
the court. She knew of the existence of
all the bonds and securities and insurance
policies and the amounts of eachâ matters
which no one excepting one enjoying Mrs.
Townsend's fullest confidence could have
known, and the court after securing ad
ditional proofs from Sullivan & Sullivan,
returned to the City Hall and confirmed
bis original order.
Speaking of the matter. Judge Bahrs
paid that after a question as to the au
thenticity of Mrs. Murray's claim had
been raised in his mind, he considered It
his duty to Investigate her right to
special letters. After completing his In
vestigation he was satisfied that Mrs.
Murray's claims were valid.
Satisfied of Her Identity.
Attorney Mat Sullivan of the firm of
Sullivan & Sullivan stated that he was
called upon shortly after Mrs. Townsend's
death by Mrs. Klla F. Murray, who re
quested him to take charge of her af
fairs. In order to determine her identity
Mr. Sullivan closely questioned the lady
as to her proofs of relationship to the
deceased. She stated that she was the
widow of John S. Murray, whom she
married September 7, 1871, at Dorchester,
Mass. Her husband, she said, died Jan
uary 17, 1899. During the last few years
of his life Murray was the cashier of
the Wnkefleld Rattan Company. One
child was born to the couple â a daughter,
named Mabel, who died April 29, 1900.
Mrs. Murray told her attorney that she
was the only child of Thomas and Almira
S. Townsend and was born in Tyngsboro,
Mass.. In 1S49. She said that her parents
two years after marriage separated and
Fhortly afterwards were divorced. Ac- i
cording to the alleged daughter, Mrs. .
Townsend's maiden name was Almira Co- '

about two weeks. In that time she may
have made several wills. I cannot give
the name of the daughter who was in the
Last, because it might lead to trouble.
The only other relative in the East is a
sister.* Both she and the daughter have
been residing near Boston. The daughter
is the heir of Mrs. Townsend and will re
ceive a handsome fortune. 1 suppose it
is the intention of Mrs. Murray to keep
everything quiet, until after the funeral.
I do not see anything out of the way in
what Mrs. Murray has done. She may
be trying to conceal something in Mrs.
Townsend's life which she would not care
to have made public.
"All the information I have was given
to me by Mrs. Townsend as an attorney.
I have no right to divulge that. It might
lead to serious difficulties should the mat
ter be brought before the court. Every
thing will be made clear when probate
proceedings are Instituted. I have no rea
son to doubt that Mrs. Murray is Mrs.
Townsend's daughter. She may have
come here from the East under an as
sumed rame or that may bo her real
name. Mrs. Townsend mav not have
given her daughter's full name when mak
ing a will. If Mrs. Murray is trying to
conceal anything I think she is going I
: about It in the wrong way. She should
come out plainly and state the facts of the I
case. I do not know whether she is the j
daughter or not and I have not seen her." I
About two weeks ago Mrs. Townsend
consulted with an old friend, a prominent
business man of this city, in regard to
making her will. She admitted to the man
she sought advice from that her relatives
were giving her unusual trouble in regard
to money matters. She dwelt especially
upon the fact that she had a niece here
who was causing her much annoyance.
The funeral of Mrs. Townsend will take
place to-morrow. The funeral notice
reads that "pursuant to the request of the
deceased funeral services as well as in
terment will be strictly private."
Lp at the Townsend home the officer
Is still on duty and no one is permitted
to enter. Old friends are turned away,
and Mrs. Murray has explained the pres
ence of the officer on duty by declaring
that she has had to close the doors upon
the friends. and alletred friends of Mrs.
xov.'nsend to prevent them from carrying
away property belonging to the deceased.
In spite of the tact that no will has
been found, it is not altogether Improba
ble that a will is in existence.
Henry C. McPike, at one time attorney
for Mrs. Townsend, last night practically
admitted, that he drew a will for Mrs.
Townsend at one time, but refused abso
lutely to give its contents or to discuss
her affairs upon the ground that they
.weFe communications to an attorney. He
admitted, though indirectly, that Mrs.
Townsend had a daughter and a sister in
the tast, but that the name of Mrs. Mur
ray did not tally with the name he knew.
ai;d he intimated that there was some
secret which Mrs. Murray was trying to
hide. He said:

Quick (sister). 219 Bergln street. Brooklyn;

FORMER HUSBAND OF MRS. TOWNSEND
COMES UPON THE SCENE OF MYSTERY
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JULY 24. 1900.
14
A >Â»i STEBT still hovers round the
SjfS events following Mrs. Almlra
Â£j ft rx S. Townsend's sudden demise.
MB Jk y Last evening a new and impor
tant character appear<-d on the
scene â Thom;is T. Townsend. who claims
to be the father of the alleged daughter
of the der.d wurr.an and -the man whoso
r.aaie the philanthropist bore. Shortly
after dark Townsend presented himself
at the California-street home, made per
eistent efforts to frain an entrance and
finally asked for an Interview with Mrs.
Murray, whom be declared he had not
Feen since 1*76. When it was explained to
him that the lady was unable to receive
him lie v.-er.t away, sayinpr he would call
to-day upon her attorneys, Sullivan & Sul
livan. Those who saw Townsend describe
him a.=5 a middle-sized man. with a snow
white mustache which proclaims his ad
vanced years.
Those in attendance at the Townsend
home were not altogether unprepared for
Townsend's appearance. Mrs. Murray,
upon her arrival here, told her attorneys,
Sullivan & Sullivan, that it was probable
her father would materialize and attempt
to lodpe a claim upon the wealth of Mrs. !
Towr.send, estimated at over a half mil
lion. Mrs. Murray also brought letters
with her to the attorneys from a promi
nent Boston law firm, in which they a-Â«ked
that MnÂ». Murray's Interest be strictly
looked after and that she be protected
from her father, who for some time had
!>een threatening to swoop down upon his
former wife and help himself to some of
tier prt-at wealth. '
In speaking of Townsend to her attor
neys Murray t;:ii<l she understood
that her father had been married several
times since he and her mother had sepa
rated. Whether the couple were ever
legally divorced no one is able to state
ln fart, the !a.ly declared that she and
her father had Quarreled because she.
I out of respect to her mother, had refused
j to meet one of these numerous wives.
Mrs. Murray succeeded yesterday, to the
; satisfaction of Judge Banrs, in establish
i intf ht-r identity ana claim of relationship
j to the dead woman. The very facts that
j make up the proof of Mrs. Murray's
claim serve also to further complicate
I matters and lend an additional air of
! mystery to the entire affair. In trying
j to establish her claims Mrs. Murray seeks
i to prove that Mrs. Towns.-nd was a vain.
I frivolous old woman, who denied her
j daughter that she might not be forced to
I admit herself oM enough to be her
mother. This denying- of iier motherhood
is put down as one of the eccentricities
of Mrs. Townsend.
To no one did Mrs. Townsend admit
that Mrs. Murray was her dauphter. To
some of the old lady's friends Mrs. Mur
ray was introduced without any claim of
relationship; to others Mrs. Townsend
Introduced her alleged daughter as her
| sister. Cyrus AV. Carmany, secretarv of the
savings and loan society with which Mrs.
Townsend transacted all her business, was
Jn 1^'M introduced to Mrs. Murray by Mrs.
Townsend. At that time Mrs. Townsend
told him Mrs. Murray was her sister
Carmany admits that he frequently for
warded for Mrs. Townsend generous sums
of money to Mrs. Murray.
To John Harms, manaper of Madison &
Rurke. Mrs. Townsend said that in case
anything happened to her she wished him
to notify Mrs. Murray. Harms made a
