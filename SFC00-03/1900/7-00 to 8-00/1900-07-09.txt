man. unable to read or write and em
phatically opposed to giving Information
of any kind. If she had been able to
write Chretien could have communicated
with her and that meant that his ex
penses would have been reduced. He said
he sent an agent to the mysterious wo
man, whose identity nvist remain a mys
tr-ry as far as the records of Judge
Troutt's court are concerned, and could
get no satisfaction.
He therefore reported that having an
idea that the dead man had a brother liv
ing either in Ireland or England he deter
mined to go to San Jose and make an In
vestigation. He went and says he drove
cut into the country in a direction known
only to himself. He sought the mysteri
ous* woman whose name and identity are
not known and received from her the
gratification of his hopes, the startling
information that Sullivan had a brother
John residing at 34 Soho Square, London.
The long lost heir had been found. John
M. Chretien had taken the first step In the
shameful scheme to secure possession of
an estate through a bogus heir. He re
turned to San Francisco and says he sent
ail necessary information and Instruc
tions to London, taking the precaution to
prepay all postage.
The Heir Vanishes Mysteriously.
And then he is forced to confess his dis
may. The scheme to produce an heir had
not progressed far enough. His letter to
"John Sullivan" was returned to him. he
says, by the London postal authorities,
with the announcement that John had
moved and had left no address. The
mysterious old woman living somewhere
near San Jose had been mistaken and
John M. Chretien asked the court for en
couragement and advice. He wanted, he
said, to communicate with the postal
authorities of London to enlist them in
his cause, to persuade them to make a
search which if undertaken by London
solicitors would involve great expense.
He wanted to advertise in the London
newspapers and, to carry the farce to its
completion, he wanted to take the testi
mony of aged and ir^irra persons whose
identity is still a myetery in order that
the proof of the heirship of John Sulli
van, which was to be established, might
not be jeopardized.
For all of this Chretien asked the Court
than an extremely shadowy reality in the
case.
. Before this happened, however, there
came another startling surprise in this
shameful conspiracy to steal through the
probate court the property of the unpro
tected dead. While the Industrious
Chretien was scouring England and Ire-
Ireland in a long distance search for the
elusive John Sullivan another attorney
equally industrious had evidently been at
work. This lawyer had not been in the
case. He had never been heard of or seen
in connection with the estate and his ap
pearance was as mysterious as were his
subsequent actions. .
It is needless to say that his Interjec
tion into the affair was a most disagree
able and annoying surprise. "While the
conspirators were insisting that they
were looking for John Sullivan, the
brother of tho dead man. this new attor
ney, James Taylor Rogers, threw a bomb
shell into their midst by announcing his
appearance as attorney for the only heirs
at-law of Joseph Sullivan, his nieces Miss
Mary Ann Sullivan and Miss Helena Sul
livan and his nephew Philip Sullivan.
These "heirs" had never been heard of
and James Taylor Rogers gave no further
information in reference to their Identity.
He did not even tell where they were to
be%found, but like three jacks In a box
they bounced into the case. James Taylor
Rogers did vouchsafe the assurance, how
ever, that In due time he would submit
proof of his clients' heirship. That was
on October 16. 1S03, and one thing was cer
tain: â¢ It John Sullivan, the alleged
brother of Joseph Sullivan, were alive
the nieces and nephew of the dead man
could not be. under the law. his only
heirs. The very documents in the case
were beginning to smell of fraud and to
tell of the conspiracy wjiich subsequently
ripened into vicious success.
Proving Heirship Out of Court.
James Taylor Rogers proved to be a
very patient lawyer. He had given no
tice that he would appear in court and
prove the heirship of three persons. He
knew that another person, who, he in
sisted, was dead, was claiming the estate,
and would In the natural course of events
secure it if no protest was made. But
Mr. . Rogers made no effort to represent
his' clients In court for more than six
months from the day he filed notice that
he would appear for them. Tnere Is ex
cellent evidence to prove, however, that
Mr. Rogers was not ignorant of the
movements of the attorney for the mys
terious John Sullivan. As a matter of
fact, the attorneys on both sides were
very carefully watching or.e another.
The attorney for the mysterious John
Suliivan. the notorious Chretien, made the
flrst move, and it proved to be the mos;
startling and sensational in the entire
case as far as it had developed. The elu
sive heir, who was supposed to live some
where in England or Ireland, had been
found at last. He had made a marvelous
leap from England or Ireland, and hatl
landed in Sacramento. At least that wa-a
what John M. Chretien declared in a stip
ulation between him and Abraham Ruef,
attorney for the Public Administrator.
Thi3 stipulation is one of the most re
markable documents In the case. It is
an appeal to Judge Troutt to permU
John Sullivan, the client of John M. Chre
tien and the claimant for the estate of
Joseph Sullivan, to make his deposition,
proving heirship. in San Francisco, before
George T. Knox, a notary public. The
stipulation recites that John Sullivan I*
a resident of Sacramento and unable to
go before Judge Troutt. No reason for
this inability is given, and the absurd re
quest Is made that the proposed heir b->
allowed to make hi* deposition in the very
city in which the court is in session.
Extraordinary as was the appeal. Abra
ham Ruef. the attorney for the Public
Administrator, agreed to It. And. to cap
the climax of mysterious proceedings.
Judge James M. Troutt issued a com
mission for the taking of this deposition.
A man who had never been seen, who had
not clearly been traced, whose very, ex
istence was a question of serious doubt
and attack, was allowed to prove his
right 'to thousands of dollars out of court.
It was' admitted that toe could come to
San Francisco, bat he could not go mto
court. The stipulation between Ruef and
Chretien was filed on April 9 of thia
year, and on the following day Juris ;
Troutt Issued the commission to Notary
George T. Knox. Eight days later Pub
lic Administrator John A- Drinkhous*
filed a petition asking- that his final ac
counts be accepted, his trust dissolved
and the entire estate be distributed ti>
John Sullivan, the mysterious client of
the notorious Chretien. The sharks wer#
ready for the final feast on the property
of the dead. But they were to meet with
a startling snag before the prey fell into
their hands.
Becord Stolen From the County
Clerk's Office.
"When the deposition of John Sullivan
was taken no one can tell and prove what
he says. There is a record that It was
filed in the office of the County Clerk on
April 13. one day after Public Administra
tor Drinkhouse asked to be relieved from
further duty as administrator. If that de
position, which is the only shadow of
proof of the heirship of the man to whom
the estate was awarded, was filed In the
office of County Clerk "William A. Deane
it has been stolen. It Is not in the
records; it is not in the vaults where such
documents are kept for safe keeping. As
far as the probate court of Judge Trouit
is concerned. It Is as If It never existed.
The shameless character of the entiro
affair i-Â» thus apparent. A man who never
appeared in court, who was supposed tr>
be either In England or Ireland, who was
mysteriously found in Sacramento and
permitted by Judge Troutt to prove, his
heirship in a notary's office, has posses
sion of an estate by authority of a de
position which should be In the office of
the County Clerk and Is not there. The
Grand Jury of San Francisco should re
quire very little more to begin an investi
gation and determine what becomes of the
estates of the dead in this city.
More than this, the "John Sullivan" who
was awarded an estate of several thou
sand dollars by order of Judge Trcutt Is
not a resident of Sacramento and never
has been. The attorneys who stipulated
that his deposition be taken, the notary
who took It. the Judge who accepted it.
cannot produce him or the witnesses who
signed the document he had made.
After eleven months of delay an heir
had been found, in a single week made hi*
appearance and proved his heirship, and
the Public Administrator was ready t<Â»
present his final accounts and give the
estate to this new found heir, notwith
standing the extremely significant fact
that more than six months before three
other heirs had been interjected Into the
case and their attorney, James Taylor
Rogers, had given assurance that ho
would prove their heirship in court. If
these heir3. whose claims were pending,
were what they professed to be. then the
man who was about to receive the estato
was an impostor. But affairs progressed
merrily on and Judge Troutt fixed th<Â»
hearing of the petition of the Public Ad
ministrator for the moraine of May i
The petition was not heard on that morn-
Ing; a bombshell had been thrown Into
the camp of the probate conspirators and
they were covered with consternation Jus:
as the estate was to pass Into their hand*.
James Taylor Rogers waited until four
dajs before the day set by Judge Troutt
for the final hearing and distribution nf
the estate and then, he presented a sensa
tional document which exposed the entire
shameful plot to rob the dead 1 . He had
at last ta*en steps to protect the intsr
ests cf those nlees and nephew in whose
behalf he promised, on October Mt to,
appear. He denounced the man who was
about to receive the estate as an im
poster. a bogus heir who was represent
ing himself to be -what he was not. and
should not receive a cent of the estate.
The man who had never been In court,
whose heirship had been proved by a
deposition which is not In the County
Clerk's office, whose identity ia a mys
tery, was a scoundrel supported by un
scrupulous attorneys. The John Sullivan
who was a brother of Joseph Sullivan
died. Rogers declared, several years ago
in London.
Bogus Heir Denounced in Court.
This sensational document was filed on
to give him money. He demanded pay-"
ment for his continuous service from May
8. 1S39, to August 23, 1*59, for the strange
trip to San Jose, for the correspondence
with the London authorities. 'for the pros
pective search for an heir who lived some
where 'in Ireland or England. The court
took the matter seriously under consid
eration and allowed John M. Chretien
$100 The allowance seemed ridiculously
small, particularly In view of the fact
that Judge Troutt had awarded Abraham
Ruef $200 for less than a month's service
and practically no work. But the crafty
Chretien made no complaint and the
search for the heir went merrily on.
Months passed, however, before the elu
sive John Sullivan received any other

He said that the former landlady of
Sullivan had referred him in his. quest
for information to an old friend of the
dead man. This old friend proved to be,

clared, an aged, extremely ignorant wo-
On August 23, 1S99, therefore, he filed his
extraordinary demand. He insisttd that
from the time of his appointment, on May
S. 1S&9. he had been continuously employed
in a search for absent or minor heirs. He
had convinced himself, he said, that Sul
livan had left no heirs in America, a most
significant fact, which John M. Chretien
ought to have reason to regret. But if
there were no heirs in America, the indus
trious attorney was not deterred.
John M. Chretien and Fel
low Conspirators Present
a Bogus Heir and Are
Awarded the Estate of
Joseph Sullivan.
THIS ease, which involves the de
liberate, systematic theft of an
estate, the criminal squandering and
misuse of funds, the manufacture of
a bogus heir and a conspiracy of un
scrupulous attorneys, has been but thinly
disguised under the forms of law in the
probate court over which Judge James M.
Troutt presides. The rascality of the con
epirators is apparent even in the docu
ments which are on rile. The Â£uilt of the
thieves is palpable in the astonishing fact
that the only evidence which might prove
the heirsfcip of the pretender to the prop
erty of the dead, the deposition made by
tie b-jgus heir, in this city while the court
tv.is fn session, is missing from the County
Cierk s office, where it should be on file
and where it should remain, at least a
paper vindication cf the claims of a man
who -was siever seen in court, who cannot
now be found and who was permitted by
tho court, on a stipulation of attorneys,
to tell his story out of court.
Joseph Sullivan, over whose estate the
human sharks of the probate court have
fought until they won a division of the
FÂ»>oi!s. was a tailor la this citv. living, up
to the time when he was taken to the
Trecch Hcspital to die. at 405 Hyde street,
.^e had few friends anu no living rela
tives. Indeed, it was a matter of con
siderable difficulty to tell who he was or
from whence he came. He had never
rcarried, and was or.e of those men the
habits of whose lives involve their aSairs
in mystery and give opportunity for
thieves in the disposition of their estates
after death.
Sullivan had accumulated over J5200,
most of which was In money In various
local bank*. He had J32S0 In the Pacific
States Saving. Loan and Building So
ciety, J235 In the Hibernia Bank and JS26
In the Sa.n Francisco Savings Union. He
also posi-esscd a few shares of stock and
a lot in outside city lands. The estate
was not much, but it was great enough, to
chow Â«rnat tkitvc! can do In the probate
court oÂ£ Judge James M. Troutt-_
Chretien Chosen by Judge Troutt.
Sullivan was taken ill in February of
last year and went to the French Hospital
for treatment. He was attended by Dr.
W. F. McXutt and Dr. Dudley Tait.- A
capital operation was i>erformed. and the
man, over whose property the probate
sharks have feasted, died on May 5, lblO.
Three days later Judge James M. Troutt
appointed the notorious and then dis
credited lawyer, John M. Chretien, attor
li.-y fur the absent and minor heirs and
the creditors. There was to be no de
lay. The dead man was not yet buried
when Judge Troutt decided that a lawyer,
â¢whose actions had made him obnoxious
to the reputable members of his profes
sion and offensive to decent men, was the
proper person to represent the absent and
minor heirs, if there were any. of the
estate. But the game had just begun;
the conspiracy, which lias covered the
court with shame, was not yet formed.
There was to be a division of legal spoils,
a Quarrel of greedy attorneys and the fil
ing of compromising documents before the
last of the estate was to leave the pro
tecting hand of Judge Troutt.
The Public Administrator, who was then
John A. Drinkhouse. was watchful of his
Interests and faithful to his duty, and
through his attorney. Abraham Ruef, ap
plied for letters of administration on the
eame day that the discredited Chretien
was appointed attorney for the absent and
minor heirs. As Sullivan left no will the
petition of the Public Administrator was
gTanted, and then began the struggle for
what the dead man had left.
In the probate cepartmem presided over
by Judge James M. Troutt the costs of ad
ministration are. enormous. It seems in
credible that before the estate passed out
of the hands of the court, and when only
a few minor debts had been paid. J1S65 70
had been eaten out of a property valued
at only &-Â£5 &7. On May 22, Wj, the Pub
lic Administrator received his appoint
ment. On June IS, ls&t. less than one
month later, Abraham Ruef, the attorney
for the Administrator, was awarded J200
on account of services rendered. And still
the notorious Chretien was looking for the
aJbmsct heirs. The pressure on Ruef's
mtntal machinery must have been severe.
But there were other expenses which the
court in its Judgment decided were just
end should be allowed. The doctors, who
attended the dead man until the under
takers took charge of hfm, had to be paid.
Dr. W. F. ilcNutt was modest. He had
j.aid only three visits and was satislied
â¢with $20. Dr. Dudley Tait. who performed
the capital operation, wanted $500. and
probably was satisfied with $350, which
Judge Troutt allowed him. If payments
like these continued Chretien would have
bad reason to look quickly for his absent
fceir*. <r.V*' Â¦
And then the undertaker had to be paid.
The hearse that carried Sullivan's body to
the prave had only one carriage behind
It. and ho poor was the dead man in
friends ;hat the undertaker furnished It.
When lie presented his bill and Judge
Jarnt-s M. Troutt allowed Jt the amount
was $-">35 SO, which was paid out of the es
tate. Funeral expenses in Judge Troutfs
court come high. Several other minor
bills and oiaims -were paid, and then the
financial duty of burying Sullivan was
complete. Â¦
A Strange Ride Into the Country.
Several months passed and no heir had
br:en found. What was left of the estate
was in the possession of the Public Ad
ministrator, when the odious John M.
Chretien presented a remarkable docu
ment and demanded that he not only be
paid out of the estate for what he had
done, but for what he expected to do. The
conspiracy to iob the estate had been
formed. A mythical heir was shadowed.

THE grossest crimes ag-ainst the dead are being committed in th-3 probate court of Judge James M.
Troutt in this city. A ring of attorneys has found this court a rich field for criminal operations,
and this morning The Call exposes a conspiracy which in its shameless audacity, in its outrageous
use of an agency -which should -protect tha dead and in its success in niching the estate of a dead
man is shocking.' The Call has been engaged in the investigation of local probate and collateral in
heritance affairs for some tijne, and in the progress of its inquiry has discovered an instance of delib
erate and well-planned fraud which must demand the attention "of the Grand Jury.
The estate of a dead man has been coiiipletsly stolen by a ring of lawyers. The property has
besn awarded by Judge â¢Txoutt to a bogus heir v/ho^ncver appeared in court, and the only document
which would have given a shadow of proof for ' his' fictitious heirship is missing from the office of the
County Clerk. The amount involved was comparatively small, something 1 more than S5000, but the
methods which gave criminal success to a plot in which heirs were invented and destroyed, in which
court processes and legal forms were used for evil ends end in which .dead men were impersonated, give
dangerous promise that other and larger estates may be stolen in like manner.
The case which The Call esposea this morning is that of Joseph Sullivan, who died without will
or known heirs on May 5,- 1899, in this city. Three days after, his death Judge James M. Troutt ap
pointed the notorious John M. Chretien attorney for. the absent heirs. The Public Administrator, John
A. Drinkhouse, through his attorney, Abraham Jtuaf , took charge of the estate. Several months later
Chretien hinted that he had found in the brother of Joseph Sullivan the only heir. As a matter of fact,
this brother had b^en dead several years. In October of last year Attorney Jamss Taylor Rogers gave
notice that he would appear for the only legal heirs â two nieces and a nephew of Joseph Sullivan â
supposed to be residing in London.
Not until April of this year was there another important move made in the conspiracy, when
Chretien announced that he had fcund the brother of Joseph Sullivan, who was supposed to be either
in lKland.br England. The crafty attorney said that he had found the heir in Gacramsnto, and begged
that he be allowed to take his deposition before George T. Knox. No reason was g^iven for this extra
ordinary request, and the court was in session. v Strange as was the demand, Judge Troutt granted it.
The deposition was taken, but has never been ssen' in the County Clerk's office. The man who made it
and the witnesses who signed it were impostors.
A day before the deposition was supposed to be filed John A. Drinkhouse appealed to the court
to be relieved from his administration, and asked that John Sullivan be given the property. Judge
Troutt fixed May 3 as the day for hearing, and on April 30 JamÂ«s Taylor Rogers filed a sensational doc
ument, in which he demanded a hearing and an opportunity to prove. that John Sullivan was an im
postor, a boguc heir impersonating- a dead man. James Taylor Rogers demanded the further right to
prove that the people he represented -were actually the nieces and nephew of Joseph Sullivan and his
. only heirs, i ....
Four days jiater-^-on -May 4 and. not May -3, a most .'significant fact â Judge James M. Troutt
awarded the estate to John Sullivan,' and in his decree of distribution, which was hidden away in the
office of the County. Clerk, he declared that James Taylor Rogers had appeared in open court and had
confessed that what, he had asserted four days before wa3 false, and that the people he claimed to
represent were not the nieces and nephew of Joseph Sullivan nor in any way related to him. These
are the scandalous facts which re veal, the atrocious operations of a ring of lawyers who operate in the
probate court of Judge James M. Troutt. This is the expose of how scoundrels are permitted to feed
upon the dead in this city.

that 'from the outset I have been full of
anxiety regarding the Europeans in Pe

to send a messenger and get help to them,
but in vain. Now all roads to Peking are

AMERICAN CAVALRY
TO FIGHT IN CHINA
Allied Force of Nearly One
Hundred Thousand Men
Soon Will Face the Boxer
Hordes.
LONDON, Ju.y 9. â The Daily
Telegraph has this dispatch from
its special correspondent:
Ju>y 8.â The Jap
anese Government has decided to
increase, immediately its force in
China to 23,000 men and 5000
horses.
CALL- HEADQUARTERS, WEL
LINGTON HOTEL, 'WASHING
TON, July 8.â An allied force of
nearly 100,000 men is in China or on
its way to Taku. These figures are
larger than those given yesterday,
but are based on more accurate informa
tion, which has just been received in an
official quarter here. It was learned to
day that several governments, apprer
dating the need of an expression of opin
ion as to the number of men required to
establish and preserve order, recently di
rected the several admirals at Taku to
wire a statement as to the strength of the
force necessary to suppress the revolt.
The instruction was a matter of oonfer
ence between the admirals, and the high
est estimate seems to have been made by
a Japanese officer, who placed the number
at between 70,000 and 100,000. The estimates
of the British, Russian and German of
ficers were smaller.
As to that made by Admiral Kempft the
authorities decline to speak, but there is
reason to believe th:it it was slightly less
than the lowest figure of the Japanese
sailor. It may be that it is Admiral
Kempff's statement that has caused the
officials to hesitate to .urge the dispatch
of troops to Taku until the arrival of the
Japanese division and the Ninth Infantry,
which will bring the total fighting
strength of the. allies to about 45.000 men. j
The allied ".force at Taku and Tientsin
now consists of -IS/iOO men. Reinforce
ments under orders consist of 19,000 Japa
nese troops, 15,000 Germans. 13,000 Rus
sians, 11,000 Americans, 10,000 British, 8000
French and 3000 Italians. .
Japanese Officer May Command.
Upon the arrival of the Japanese division
at Taku the question of the officer who
will be placed in command will naturally
arise. The Japanese corps will be com
manded by a lieutenant general, and, so
far as known here, he will be the rank-
Ing officer. It may be that Russia may
not desire to permit Japan to have a pre
ponderating force and a Japanese officer
in the direction of affairs, and may send
an officer with the rank of general. to com
mand her forces. â¢- He would, of course,
rank the Japanese officer. So far as this
Government is concerned, it is willing to
have any efficient officer in command, be
he Russian or Japanese, provided haste
is observed in starting the expedition to
the relief of Peking.
Considerable satisfaction is felt In of
ficial circles at the declaration of M. Del
casse yesterday that '.'it is impossible for
one power to declare war against China."
This is the understanding of the authori
ties here, and they are hopeful that that
view â¢will 1 continue to, prevail. An inter
national law expert who discussed the
situation to-day made this statement:
"Prince Tuan seems to be at the head
of 'the trouble. He is not recognized by j
any power, or even by his own people.
The situation from an. International point
of view Is this: ; Certain hostile conditions
exist, of which the powers take notice, as
they take notice of ; any fa^ts affecting
them. The death of the Ministers would
not; alter. the legal situation, there being
no government back of the crime. " Ac
cording to the facts thus far obtainable,
the Government of China which the
United States has been recognizing: has
been overthrown by persons who are com
mitting violence, and Prince Tuan has as
sumed to take charge of affairs in the
capital. From -a legal point of view Tuan
is the head of a' band of outlaws and mur
derers and may be punished as their lead
er. You cannot ; declare war upon out
laws, though hostilities may exist."

house of all China news, say that a com
bined force \ of Russians and Japanese

The dispatch also says the loyal troops under Prince Ching, who is heading a counter revo
lution, had attacked the rebels in Peking. The Governor of Shantung, according to the same au
thority, is reported to have declined to obey Prince Tuan's orders to seize Nankin. - '
Further dispatches from Shanghai say the legations were holding out on July 3 that the
rebels had been repulsed with a loss of 2000 and that the Boxers were discouraged. They also re
port that a Chinese journal confirms the announcement of Prince (Thing's counter revolution in
Peking.' x . . . ;
BRUSSELS, July 8.â A dispatch from Shanghai received here says that, according to a
high Chinese official/the two legations which were still holding out on July 2 were the objects of
incessant attacks. There had been some losses among the troops guarding the legations but the
diplomatists were safe. .,-,.,
PRINCE CHUSTO- HEADS COUNTER REVOLUTION.
LOXDOX, July 9, 2:45 a. m. â The foreign Consuls at Shanghai met on July 7 and officially
announced that the legations at Peking were safe on July 4. The foregoing statement, read
with Consul Warren's dispatch to the Foreign Office on Sunday, makes it" possible to be
lieve that the legations will hold out for a number of days yet. Having fought to a standstill the
first outbursts of fanatical fury, it is believed that something may intervene to save them.
The news, after the sinister rumors of the last ten days, is enough upon which to build up hopes."
tt The Shanghai correspondent of the Express, telegraphing on Sunday at 5:10 p. m., throws
doubt upon Consul Warren's information. He says:
"Tao Tai Sheng now admits that there was an error in his communication to General War
ren. The date of the courier's arrival at Chien Fu was July 3, which does not apply to his depar
ture from Peking."
The journey from Peking to Chien Fu takes five days. The courier therefore could not
have left Peking later than June 28. The date of the massacre there, as given by Chinese reports,
was June 30 or July 1. ;
Tientjin is still hard pressed. A Chinese force numbering from 80,000 to 100,000 men, as
estimated by inconclusive reconnoissances, floods the country round about Tientsin, communication
between which place and Taku is apparently possible by river only.
A Chefu dispatch to the Express says the Russians have landed 8000 men at Taku and the
Japanese have discharged several transports. The Japanese pushed on to Tientsin, leading in the
subsequent assault upon the native city, in which their commander was killed. Ten more trans
ports are engaged at Japanese ports. With the 10,000 British India troops afloat and fresh Japan
ese contingents it is quite probable that the allies will have '50,000 men ashore.
The disorders in the provinces appear to be increasing in violence. A Chinese army is with
in forty miles of Newchwang, and the foreigners are preparing to abandon their homes. The
southern part of the province is swept by raiders, destroying all works of the white man, except
in spots garrisoned by Russians. . Proclamations have been posted in all villages near Chefu call
ing upon the loyal Chinese to rise and expel the foreigners for introducing among the pious Chi
nese an immoral religion. Every good Buddhist is expected to kneel three hours daily, knock his
head upon the floor thrice and pray earnestly that sudden, cruel death may overtake all aliens.
The foreign settlement at Chefu is at the mercy of two Chinese forts equipped with Krupp
guns which command two sides of the city. Six warships, including* the United States gunboat
Nashville, are constantly cleared for action.
The provisional government at Peking appears to. have designs upon the southern prov
inces. Besides having ordered Kwang Shikai to advance upon Nankin, which Kwang Shikai says
he will not do, Prince Tuan has sent an army along the route of the grand canal.
Nankin is on the south bank of a river nearly a mile wide. The British cruisers Hermione
and Pique I will assist in repelling attempts to cross. Six Chinese cruisers are there and 17,000
Chinese troops are at the disposal of Viceroy Liu Kun Yi. The forts mount thirty - four high
power modern guns. The foreigners in Shanghai are becoming uneasy. Everything depends, they
feel, on Viceroy Liu Kun Yi.
Refugees from Tientsin arriving at Shanghai say that only five civilian foreigners were
killed during the long Chinese bombardment. The foreign women became so indifferent that they
walked through the streets, not heeding the shells. Most of the civilians were deported to Taku,
thence to be conveyed to Shanghai.
The courier mentioned in Consul I Warren's dispatch gives a strange picture, says the Daily
Mail's Shanghai correspondent, of haw life jostles death in Peking. Business apparently.goes on
as usual. The shops and theaters are open and the streets are full of people. No imperial troops
except those of General Tung Fuh Siang took part in the fighting. The courier even asserts pos
itively that provisions are being supplied to the legations, but by whom he does not say. The Box
ers and General Tun Fuh Siang do not get along well. The Boxers assert that they do all the
fighting and the latter all the looting and nothing else.
General Kwang Shikai, Governor of Shantung, the correspondent of the Daily Mail, pre
dicts that by July 11 the Boxers will disband and negotiations will be begun for peace. Neverthe
less the circumstantial rumors of dark things to come are in circulation.
CHEFU, July 8. â The American Consul here has received a communication from Taku,
under date of Thursday, saying that ten thousand Chinese under General Nieh appeared out
side of Tientsin on Wednesday and reoccupied the eastern arsenal. The Chinese are fortify
ing the native city of Tientsin. The situation there is ponsidered critical. Communication
between Tong Ku and Tientsin is again threatened. The Boxer influence is increasing in
Shantung province. Christians at Chinfu have been called upon to renounce their faith. The
French Consul reports that the Ching Chou Fu orphanage has been pillaged.
A steamer has arrived from New Schwang with nine refugee sisters and one priest from
Moukden, where the Catholic mission was burned and three sisters and a. Bishop murdered.
An inflammatory placard was posted in the Chefu native city last night.
The United States cruiser Brooklyn, Admiral Remey, called here to-day, forty- five hours
from Nagasaki, and proceeded to Taku. Three hundred and fifty marines intended landing
on Sunday morning. The Logan, bearing the Ninth Regiment of United States Infantry, ;
passed Chefu on Friday on their way to Taku. . . ;

The youag man had been troubled with
Insomnia for some time. Yesterday morn-
Ing he went to his room at 9:30 o'clock,
asking his sister to call him at 5 p. m.
When Miss McNally went to call her
brother she found him unconscious. Dr.
F. E. Hughes was calle 1 and did all In
his power for the patient. McNally never
regained consciousness, passing away
about midnight. He had been taking
strong medicine for sleeplessness, and it
1b supposed he took an overdose. The
autopsy will determine the cause of his
death.
The deceased was 34 years old. He 'was
engaged In the real estate and Insurance
business, and had a host of friends in this
city.

the distribution of the estate to his cli

very interesting people possess the en

possesses some very charming corre

tell an entertaining story of some ro
mance by which they choose him as their
lawyer. As the mysterious John Sullivan

These London heirs, Mr. Rogers says, are
tho children cf the unfortunate John Sul

6n industrious career as a tailor in Lon
don at 34 Soho Square.
Making these startling assertions, James
Taylor Rogers demanded of Judge Troutt
that ne bear the petition of these Lon
don heirs ar.d postpone the petition of the
Public Administrator for final distribution
â¢ which was set for May 3. The attorney de
manded that he be given opportunity to
EUbmU proofs of what he asserted. He
<:â¢ tnanded the right to prove the claims
Â«.f bli client? and asked that the estate
be Â«:istributed to them In three equal
rl;ares. In conclusion he prayed the court
not to distribute the estate to the bogus
John Sullivan who had appeared in the
caw.
Here, within four days of the sharks*
fea^t, came an upheaval which threatened
to destroy everything. Final distribution
of th* rotate was not made on May 3, the

from Nome, having left there June 26. She

Fiedler, who is a resident of Terre

Nome is just as good as it has been re

place for a poor man, as any one who
wishes work can find it. On Peny River,
he says, he saw men with the crudest ap

to the man. He says that on the beach he
offered men $4 an hour to handle freight
and many of them laughed at him. Fied

The Centennial reports that the barj?o
Skookum made the trip In good shape and

nine passengers.
Centennial passengers report that four
or five miles up and down the water front

instructed by his attorney. Judge E. F.
Fitzpatrlck of Redwood City, not to talk,
and he is trying to obey his counsel's ad
vice to the letter. He could not, however,
let the opportunity pass without stamp
ing the statement ftnade In a yellow
journal that he had made a confession of
guilt a falsehood. He said positively that
the man who wrote the statement wholly
misconstrued H's meaning. In the pres
ence of two deputy sheriffs he reiterated
that he was innocent and that he knew
Mr. Ehlers was Innocent.* He expressed
the hope that the trial would be to-day.
The following statement was dictated by
Lemcscher to a representative of the
Call: *
"I knov: Mr. Ehlers is innocent. If
they try to put the crime on him. I would
rather suffer for him. The reporter who
took the statement down that I admitted
that Mr. Ehlers was guilty and would
take upon myself the punjshment got the
wronjr idea. I did not mean to say that
Ehlers >was guilty, r meant that rather
than see Ehlers punished for a crime
he had net committed I would take tho
blame myself, for tbe reason that he Is a
marritd man and has a family and I am
single anil alone in th's world.
"The statement published in the Exam
iner is not a confession and was ne,ver in
tended as si'ch. I have made no incrim
inating statements and do not intend to
say anything further, as my attorney has
advised me not to. When the time comes
we will prove our innocence."
Did Not Get $20 From "Widow.
Lemoscher^ further said, despite his
declaration that he would talk no further,
that he had not read the alleged confes
sion made by Mrs. Imsand and that she
did not make It known to him that she
haÂ»l talked for publication when she was
with him during the afternoon. He said
the lads couiii not read English with any
proficiency and therefore might not have
paid any attention to the statements made
In the paper. He wanted It understood
that Mrs. Imsand never gave him $2J with
which to buy a gun. He swore that he
never accented any monev from the
woman for thrt purpose. He laughed at
the idea of her glvinfr him money as he
said he h.Â°.d money of hfs own.
John Kaehmann. the gunsmith at whose
place the rifles which are said to have
been used in the killing of Mrs. Mitchell
and son were bought, also called on
Lemoscher at the jail during the after
noon. After his Interview with Lemoscher
he said:
"Lemoscher is very angry over the
statement accredited to Mrs. Imsand that
she had furnished him $20 with which to
buy a gun for Ehlers. â¢ Mrs. Imsand called
; on lemoscher at tho jail to-day and they
had a long talk. He says she never gave
him any' money with which to buy a rifle
and never mentioned to him the matter
of buying weapons. Lemoscher knows
that even if such a thing were true no
sane woman would make herself an ac
cessory to a murder by stating It publicly.
"I am now convinced that Ehlers was
not with Lemoscher when the last named
bought the rifles from me. There was a
man vith him, but I do not know who it
was. f know it was not Ehlers. Another
thing I wish to say is that Lemoscher did
not buy a shotgun from me. nor did the
man with him. All that was bought was
the tTVo rifles and the ammunition."

Mrs. Imsand Visits Lemoscher. ,
Deputy Sheriff Kelly, in the absence of
Sheriff Mansfield of San Mateo County,
was constantly on the jump yesterday
opening the jron doors that lead to the
prison wherein Lemoscher, Ehlers and Al
bert Gayer, the men suspected of having
murdered the wife and son of William
Mitchell, are located. The most import
ant visitor of the day. however, was Mrs.
Imsand. the woman whose husband was
the first victim of the deadly feud which
ha a been raging at Colma. Mrs. Imsaml
was admitted to the eel! of Lemoscher j*nd
In the presence of. the jailer discussed
matters of Importance. They conversed
in Swedish and p.ft'-r the woman had left,
Lexnozcher volunteered the information
that he had sent for her to ask her to
dispose of the ranch over which all the
trmihle had been. The prisoner owns a
half, of the hog 1 ranch and as the stock
hns suffered during his enforced absence,
he thinks it ought to lie sold. He said
that a rn::n n.-irm-d Scrossir.s v.ho lives in
the vicinity of the place is willing to buy
it. despite th<> presence of an uncongenial
neighbor. Lemcscher strenuously denied
that the reason be wanted the rnnch sol.l
was to raise money 'for the defense of

"The color line cuts no figure with us."
he said, "for we have in our community
two negroes who know how to behave
themselves and have the respect of all.

people of Cnlma are bitter
I ajrainst William Mitchell and the re
[ msin'.nft members of his family. The
aped colored man. despite his Joss of
wife and favorite son. does not fear his
rnemies. He Js resolved to flpht them to
the bitter end, if necessary, with powder
nnd ball. He has intrenched himself in
his cabin in the canyon, barricading the
doors and windows, and preparing to fight
to the death if it becomes necesasry to
do this to hold his hog ranch.
Yesterday the old negro slipped away
fr^m his ranch for a few hours to attend
the funeral of his murdered wife and son.
The funeral was held in this city, from
the undertaking parlors of the California
I'ndertaking Company, at 1:30 p. m.. and
there was an extremely dramatic fea
ture. Rev. Tighlman Brown prayed
that God give the young menâpresum
ably meaning Mitchell's sons â strengrth
to stand, together, and that retribution
might come quickly to the murderers.
He prayed that he might have the power
t-i bind all nÂ»Â£rroÂ»-s tcg-ether and to grive
them the strength to say, with Patrick
Henry, "Give us liberty or give us dtath."
The prayer had a remarkable effect
upon the colored people, who crowded the
chapel. The women moaned and cried,
but the men clenched their lls:s and,
half-rising In their places, glared with
bloodshot eyes upon the eloquent
preacher.
After the services Mitchell crept back
to his cheerless hovel on the bleak hill
side, crfaere his haif-fed dogs were bay-
Ing and his boss wen- cuddled in the cor
r.ers of their i>ens to -escape the ohill night
air. The old man approaehed the place
cautiously, keeping a sharp lookout for
hidden foes. There is no such word as
"fear" in his vocabulary, but long ex
perience with hostile neighbors has
taught him caution. "I do not care for
life." he says, "but although my skin is
black I do not propose to have these peo
ple overrun me. I will fight them if they
Â¦want it. and they must kill me to g-et rid
of me."
Fake Stories of Confessions.
There is another side of the story. The
men aim are accused of the latest mur
der. Frank lemoscher and Caesar Ehlers.
now in the Jail at Redwood City, are not
yet convicted. The' sensational stories of
confessions on the part of Mrs. J. I. Im-
sand and Lemoscher. which appeared in a
' local "yellow journal." are most em
phatically denied by the parties quoted,
and they threaten to make it "warm" for
the reporter who. masquerading under the
guise of an officer, tried to work a yellow
bluff upon th*Â»m. The "confession-"' story
was cut from whole cloth, aa is shown
from statements made by Lemoscher and
.Mrs. Imsand.
As e matter of fact there were no new
developments in the case yesterday. Col
ma was quiet, and there was nothing to
indicate that the town had f\er been dls
turln-d. except the general expression of
public opinion. It is all aprainst the "nig-
S<=-r." It is ;afe to say that the majority
of the people of the town and surround
ing territory believe tirmly that Mitchell
killed his own wife and son. The belief
prows out of pure prejudice. For years
Mitchell has been considered a renegade
and thief, and every hand is against him.
"I'll bet you $liKX)." said a prominent citi
zen. "th.it the men under arrest will not
be convicted of this killing, nor will any
citizen of Colma suffer, for Mitchell al
ways used firearms and threatened others
and it is only justice that he should
suffer."
Mrs. Itrisa*n<] is indignant because of the
publication of the alleged confession from
her. She is staying at the home of John

COLMA. July 8, 1900.
THE confession it is alleged I have made is a lie out of
whole cloth. Yesterday afternoon a young man
came to me and said he came from Sheriff Mans
field to arrest me. but he would not take me to-night if I
would tell the truth about this trouble. He said that Ehlers
and Lemoscher had confessed to the shooting and that they
had said I was the cause of it; that I had said to them I
wanted to get the niggers out of the way. and that if I had
not insisted on it they would not have killed them.
I said that no matter what they had said the truth is
that we had never had any such trouble. Then Mr.. Brims ,
came in and recognized the man as an Examiner reporter,
and accused him of lying about Mrs. Bruns. The man went
out with Bruns and did not come back. This is all the con
versation I had with him.
This morning he came to Mrs. Luhrs and told her that
I had made a confession to him and he tried to force her to
talk, saying he had a right to arrest her. Mrs. Luhrs ac-"
cused him of Tying, and he went away.

Baden for a few days. The young man
works for the Pacific Tallow "Works ar.d is
willing to provide a home for his f;ither.
But William won't retreat under
fire. He Is going back to the little hosr

weather it out to the end of the chapter,
and his expression when he says It leaves
no doubt that he will keep his word to the
bitter end.
Just as the shovelers were about to fling
the first earth Into the open graves the
old man broke a white flower off a great
bunch and flung it down into the grave
of his wife. Once more his trrief seemed
about to break out. His family led him to
a carriage. Then the clods fell.
At the cemetery Mitchell stood bare
headed by the graves while side
by side the coffins were lowered.
He was outwardly calm but tha
tears which welled out of his eyes and
streamed down his cheeks as the bodies of
his beloved sank out of sight showed the
pain that was racking him under the
mask.
Rev. Mr. Brown's prayer made a
marked impression upon the people pres
ent. His voice was raised to a high pitch
and his manner betokened the sort of
fervid excitement that works upon the
emotions of the colored race in camp
meetings. When he prayed for speedy
retributlon upon the heads of the mur
derers, the kneeling auditors glared at
the black caskets with strained eyes and
moaned. His plea for young men to stand
together was responded to by exclama
tions and shrieks from the women. The
height of intensity was reached when
he prayed for power to bind all negroes
together and give them strength to tight
for the principle announced by Patrick
Henry. "Give me liberty or give me
dÂ«-nth."
Then those in the room saw a terribi*
scene. Mitchell broke from where he had
been sitting quiet as though stunned, and
threw himself on his knees beside the two
cheap coffins. In a broken voice he called
on his wife, and sobbing prayed to God
to take him, too. The old man's grief was
contagious: the whole roomful were los
ing self-control when Mitchell's sons led
their father gently away. He offered no
resistance. Then the coffins were closed,
the doors of the hearses shut, and the
crowd streamed out.

At 1:30 o'clock yesterday , afternoon tho
rooms at the undertaking establishment
were filled with Africans "of many call

In the back room lay the two coffins sido
by side. When William Mitchell entered
the room he seemed very old and weak.
He was accompanied by his two sons,
both tall, strapping fellows, and two
daughters. The latter were crylnjr. The
two sons, Rudolph and Henry, looked im
passive. Williams' face was twitching,
and when his eyes fell on the two black
coffins he seemed about to cry out. but
checked himself and sat down on a
lounge near the window with hia daugh
ters. Then last rites began. The Rev.
Tighlman Brown and the Rev. W. T.

Episcopal Church, read the service in full,
impressive voices.
tened quietly to the solemn burial service,
but when the last clod fell with a hollow
thud on the oaken casket containing the
body of one who had worked by his side
and known the bitterness of . his long
struggle against an unreasoning prejudice,
his bent figure straightened. His thoughts
then were plain to every bystander. The
harsh Old Testament motto, "An eye for
an eye." evidently filled his mind to tho
exclusion of the milder doctrine of resig

Four new armored cruisers of 8000 tons,
19,Â£>00 horsepower and 22 knots speed, are
to be built for the Italian navy. Their
armor belt will be C Inches thick and the
battery will consist of twelve eight-inch
quick-firers and twelve three-inch rapld

Ausalfa, Genove, Pisa and Venezia and
the plans indicate very handsome ships
with very ingenious arrangement of guns.
The Norwegian coast defense ship Els
vold was launched at the Armstrong
yard, Elswick, June 24. She is 3S50 tons
displacement, has a 6-inch armor belt
and two turrets, each containing one 8.2
inch quick-firer. The broadside battery
is composed' of six 6-inch, eight 12-pound
ers and six 3-pounders. The engines are
of 4500 horsepower, calculated to give a
speed of 1C% knots and her coal bunker
capacity is 400 tons. /
The recent unfavorable repdrt of the
British cruiser Europa's enormous coal
consuming capacity is, no doubt, greatly
at variance, with the facts. It is alleged
that she burned 22,000 tons of coal on her
voyage from Portsmouth, England, to
Sydney, and that -she coaled at eight dif
ferent ports. The Europa is a new
cruiser of. 11,000 tons and has a coal ca
pacity of 1900 tons. On her trip to Sydney
the coaling places would only number
seven and starting with full bunkers she
would have at least 500 tons remaining
when replenishing at each coaling port.

NEWS OF THE NAVIES.
From the beginning the Park Board has been one
of the administrative bodies of the city in which the
people have had confidence. Â»The Commissioners
have not always acted wisely, perhaps, or in accord
Of the value of that particular clause of the char
ter the people have now ample proof. Had not the
Park Commission been created an independent board
we should have seen already the beginning of a sys
tem which in the end would have made the park .1
part of the spoils system of politics. The Super
visors would have appropriated money to be used as
they dictated, riot as the Commissioners chose. The
establishment of a library in the park would have
been a precedent for the establishment of any other
sort of institution the Mayor or the Supervisors might
take a fancy to. In the end the Park Commissioner*
would have been reduced to little more than figure
heads and the City Hall gang be in control of the
whole thing.
The action of Phelan in trying to dictate how the
park funds shall be expended was indted an attempt
to defeat a plain provision of the new charter, of
which he pretends to be such a supporter. With re
spect to the powers of the Park Board the charter
says: "The Commissioners shall have the complete
and exclusive control, management and direction of
the aforesaid parks, squares, avenues and, grounds,
and the exclusive right to erect and to superintend the
erection of buildings and structures thereon; and to
that end may employ and appoint superintendents,
laborers, surveyors, engineers and other officers and
assistants, and prescribe and fix their duties, authority
and compensation. They shall have exclusive man
agement and-disburscment of all funds legally appro
priated or received from any source for the support
of said parks, squares, avenues and grounds."
PH ELAN'S attempt to override the Park Com
missioners and to compel them to carry out his
fantastic scheme of turning the park lodge- into
a branch library has resulted in adding to his record
another fiasco. He" succeeded in getting the Super
visors to make the appropriations for the park not in
a lump sum, as has been the custom, but for certain
specified purposes, including among the items an ap
propriation of $5000 "for such alterations as may be
required to fit the park lodge for public use." That
success on his part, how : evcr, was a mere futility. The
Supervisors have no right to determine how the park
funds are to be expended, and Mr. Williams, the act
ing Auditor, has so decided.

in a London court, Commander William

the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty

compromised by the father consenting to
have the child taken out of his custody,
that she be taken to a school In Germany
for four years, the father to pay all ex
penses. The court consented to this prop
osition, stipulating that it be made in
writing and Include provisions giving the
society, as well as the father, access to
the girl. The case excited much interest
in naval circles and its outcome was
hailed with satisfaction by the service,

\A ARCONI'S system of wireless telegraphy has
/ \ now passed beyond the . experimental stage
* * and has taken its place among the established
means of civilized men for transmitting messages. It
has been employed by the military authorities in
sending messages between Alcatraz and Fort Mason
for upward of two weeks, and the reports are that the
system has been found reliable in every respect, the
sounders have responded perfectly, and there has
been no difficulty in carrying on conversations be
tween the two posts by the electric forces sent vi
brating through the air.
Less than a year ago, on August 24, 1899, The Call
applied wireless telegraphy for the first time to the
uses of journalism, made the first notably successful
experiment with it on the Pacific Coast, and thereby
succeeded in transmitting across a wide stret'eh of sea
the first information of the arrival off the Golden
Gate of the transport Sherman bringing: home the
California volunteers from Manila. A little -later, in
connection with the New York Herald, The Call
again demonstrated the practical value of Marconi's
invention by making use of it to report the incidents
of the international yacht race. In that instance the
telegraphic apparatus was placed upon a steamer,
which followed the yachts over their course, and mes
sages were sent from the open sea to the land of every
shifting of sails and every tack and feature of the race
it occurred.
When these feats were achieved they were regarded
as marvels. Many people were incredulous concerning
them. The Examiner openly derided the system, and
mocked at the inventor as "Signor Macaroni." That
was less than one year ago, and yet so swiftly does
the modern mind adapt itself to the marvels of science
and invention that what was regarded with incredulity
then is now accepted as a fact of such little moment
th.it it hardly receives attention. People are" not sur
prised .that the Government is making use of wire
less telegraphy; they would probably be surprised if
it aid not. . Â» .
The large amount of capital invested in wire sys
tems of telegraphy will of course be adverse to any
speed> introduction of wireless telegraphy into com
mercial use. Nevertheless private enterprise will
sr oner or later follow governmental enterprise. We
shall have wireless telegraphy in general use
much â¢ sooner than the public expects. That use will
come about gradually and silently, until some day
the slow coach Examiner will get a wireless message,
and then the public will be startled by a page of dis
play type announcing that the dispatch was received
from the Ahkound of Swat.
THE WIRELESo TELEGRAPH
hist what is causing this fine fruit market is not
precisely known. Some dealers think that the crop
has been overestimated: others that the demand for
shipment has reached such immense proportions that
it is absorbing an unprecedented quantity of fruit.
However this may be. the cold fact remains that this
i? one of the finest fruit years California has enjoyed
for a long time. â¢ .
General trade in San Francisco is good. With the
exception of the hide and leather and wool men the
local merchants as a rule report a good outward
movement. Provisions are slow7 but they always are
at this timr of the year. Collections are easy, and
there are no serious failures. Grains of all kinds are
bringing more money, owing to Government and ex
port necessities and the feeling is* one of cheerful
ness and confidence
The feature in California at the moment is the ex
traordinary demand for fresh fruit. It was thought at
the beginning of the reason that in view of the warm
winter and the apparent size of the crop that we
votild be swamped v.-ith fruit this summer. But the
season has surprised the oldest heads in the trade. It
is one of the very best for years. All kinds of Iruit
have thus far brought excellent prices, and the usual
midsummer glut has not appeared up to date. The
Northern and Eastern demand has been enormous,
and even the canners' combine has had to buy fruit
'rcm second hands to obtain, supplies.
Still there are tome lines that are not rosy. Wool
is stagnant, and the manufacturers are buying only
from hand to mouth to satisfy a very slack demand.
A good many cotton mills have also closed down, and
too many boot and shoe works are idle for the good
of the business. Hides and leather are neglected and
very weak, with accumulating stocks. Provisions are
not over firm, and locally are very weak and dull, with
continued cutting, especially in hams. The livestock
market here in San Francisco is again tending up
ward, quotations for almost all descriptions having 1
been marked up during the past few days.
THE commercial sky seemed clearer in some re
kpects last week, though in others it was still
murky. The half-yearly statistics probably had
something to do with the more cheerful aspect of af
fairs, for they showed a satisfactory condition of
trade, notwithstanding the subsidence of the recent
business boom. These statistics show smaller failures
than for some years, while numerically they were the
fewest since 1882. The country's bank clearings were
11 per cent smaller thiun during the first half of 1899.
but the railroad earnings were about 10 per cent
larger. The settlement of labor troubles, too, is re
sulting in an improved demand for building material
in the affected places, and the recent rains in the
Northwest have not only brightened the wheat situa
tion, but promised larger railroad earnings there than
were hoped for ten days ago, and in addition have
started up the white pine manufacturing works and
thereby given, employment to many thousand pre
viously idle men. There is a belief, too, in Wall
street that better conditions are in store for the iron
trade. Anthracite coal has advanced 25 cents, sugarand
coffee are still higher, and tea holds its recent advance
without difficulty. So it will be seen that the outlook
is better all around, though it is the height of the mid
summer dull season. One of the striking and most
encouraging features at the moment is the financial
strength of the country. Financiers are calling atten
tion to the fact that in spite of the serious decline in
iron the failures in this branch are extremely small.
Thus, while many works have closed down and Bes
st-mer pig has declined from $.25 to $18 and plates from
3 cents to 1^ cents, and the average for iron and
steel products has fallen 25 per cent since January 10,
the list of failures in this trade during the past quar
ter numbers only six, with liabilities of less than $29,
000. This shows the great financial reserve force of
the country. Were money not plentiful and readily
accessible the decline would have been accompanied by
more failures, and the liabilities would have been
much larger.

tury. The latest Easter can occur Is April
26. and it will thus occur but once In the
coming century-â in 19-13. The last time
it occurred was April 26, 1SS6. Whenever
Easter occurs on March 27, or April 3,
10, 17 or 24, Christmas also occurs on Sun
day.
Though some of the objects aimed at
by the church authorities who fixed upon
the method of determining \he date of
Easter was to prevent its occurring on the
same date as the Jewish Passover, never
theless the two events will occur together
? four times in the twentieth centuryâ April
12. 1903; 'April 1, 1923; April 17. 1927, and
April h, 19S1.
The twentieth century will contain 36,525
days, which lacks one day of being ex
actly 521S weeks. The day of the week
that will not occSr as often as each of the
others Is Monday. Fifteen out of the hun
dred years will begin on Wednesday and
I the same number on Friday. ' Fourteen
! will begin on each of the other days of
I the week,
Several announcements are made of
changes to be Inaugurated with the open-
Ing of the new century. The first of im
portance is that Russia will adopt the
Gregorian calendar. This will be Bone by
omitting thirteen days, the amount of the
error that will have accumulated after the
j close of February, 1900. The Russians will
then write January 1, 1901, Instead of De
cember 19. 1900.
The Â¦ other important announcement Is
that it is not at all unlikely that the
astronomical day, which now begins at
noon of the civil day, will begin with the
civil day at midnight. The present meth
od of having the astronomical day to be-
gin twelve hours after the beginning of
the civil day is apt to be confusing. On
the other hand, to have the former begin
at midnight will be to them somewhat in
convenient.
A3 to eclipses in the coming century,
there will be about 3S0 of them, the num
ber of solar being to the number of lunar
In about the ratio of 4 to 3.
What la. the very rare occurrence in a
calendar year will happen in 1905, the flr.^t
time since 1S23, viz: Seven eclipses, the
largest possible number that can happen
In a year.
There are eight total solar eclipses pre
dicted to occur visible in the Chitel
States in 191S, 1923, 1943. 1979. 19S4. ISM.
There will also occur twelve transits of
Mercury. A transit of Venus, however,
which is of much more importance, will
not occur within the next century. The
earliest date predicted is June 8. 2004.
"While it is claimed at least 100<> comet -t
come within visible range of the eartli
within a century, there Is reasonable cer
tainty of the recurrence of but one ex
traordinary comet In the next century.
That one is known as Hailey's. It wa.-Â»

1910 or 1911. The exact time i3 not known,
owing to slight modifications in Its orbit,

served comet to appear in all its blazing
glory at any time. No astronomer knows.
Of famous meteoric showers there will
probably be three recurrences of the Le
onids In 1932, 1965 and In 136S, as In th*

THE twentieth century will commencs
on January 1, 1901. It will open on
Tuesday and close on Sunday. It
will have the greatest number of
leap years possible â 24. The year 1004 will
be the first one. then every fourth year
after that to and including the year 2000.
February will three times have five Sun
dr.ysâin 1920, 1948 and. 1976.
*ln 1901 Federal Memorial day, Fourth
of July and Thanksgiving day will occur
on the same day In the week. Then after
that the same 'thing will happen at the
following intervals: Six. 11. 11, 6. 11, 11,
years, and ao on, or in 1907, 101S, 1929, 1935,
and 90 on.
In the years' 1912. 1914, 1969 and 199S there
are four holidays that will fall on the
same day in the weekâ the three already
mentioned and Washnigton's birthday an
niversary, as also February 29.
Thanksgiving day and Christmas will
occur the same day in the week In 1906,
and then at successive Intervals of 11. 6,
11, 11, 6, 11, years, and so on; also in 192S,
1956 and 19S4. March 4 will fall on Sunday
in the inaugural years 1917. 1946 and 1973.
The same yearly calendar that was used
in 1S95 can be used again In 1901.
The following are. in order beginning
with 1901, the dates of Easter for the
first twenty-five years of the century:
April 7, March 30. April 12, 3, 23. 15, March
31, April 9, 11. March 27, April 16, 7, March
23, April 12. 4, 23. 8, March 31. April 20, 4,
March 27. April 16. 1, 20, 12. The earliest
possible date on which Easter can occur
is March 23. The last time it occurred
on this date was in ISIS, but it wfll not
occur again until after the twentieth cen-
It is to be noted, moreover, that special thanks in
this instance are due to the members of the theatrical
profession for their contributions and services. With
out their aid it would have been difficult to have raised
so large a fund, and it could not have been done with
anything like the promptness that has marked its
achievement. To them, therefore, we owe a debt of
gratitude, inasmuch as they enabled us to make a rec
ord so creditable to our city.
The contributions made so generously will be called
charity, and yet they were animated less by pity for
the forlorn ones than by admiration for the deed of
a true hero of the highest type. Rightly speaking it
i?, therefore, not so much a charity- fund as a tribute
to that â¢ supreme courage which enables man to
achieve sublime action even at the cost of life itself.
It must be gratifying to every right-hearted man to
know that he lives in a community responsive to
deeds like that. There is something noble in the way
with which San Francisco has met the responsibility
imposed by the destitution in which the hero's fam
ily was left. It is now clear we have more of civic
virtue than is generally conceded to us', and that we
are not indifferent to appeals to the higher sentiments
of mankind*.
Upon that showing the people of San Francisco are
entitled to commendation for the liberality as well as
for the promptness with which they responded to the
appeal made to them in behalf of the widow and the
children of the heroic fireman who gave his life in
the performance of his duty and at the call of hu
manity.
The Chief adds that, acting in accord with the wish
of Mrs. Sweeney that he take charge of the fund, he
will associate with himself two other trustees and will
invest the money in good interest paying securities,
and he estimates that the interest, together with the
pension paid by the Fire Department, will assure to
Mrs. Sweeney and her children an income of about
$90 a month. ;
CHIEF SULLIVAN in a letter to The Call set
ting forth the amount of money received by him
for the Sweeney fund up to Saturday, and
stating the manner in which he" intends to invest it,
said: "I beg to inclose to you a copy of a letter which
I have to-day received from the secretary of the As
sociated Theatrical Managers, which shows that the
grand total of the saie of tickets for the. performance
reached the sum of seven thousand nine hundred and
fifty-eight dollars ($795Â§). T"he amount of cash con
tributions which have been sent to me up to jhis
afternoon amounts to the munificent sum of six thou
sand five hundred and ninety-three' dollars and sixty
cents ($6593 60), giving a grand total of fourteen
thousand five hundred and fifty-one dollars and sixty
cents ($14,551 6b)."

STATES SURE FOR McKINLEY.
Four years ago McKinley received 7.104,779 and
Bryan 6,502,925 of the popular vote, and of the
Electoral College McKinley received 271 votes against
176 for Bryan. In that election McKinley carried
Maryland, West Virginia and all of Kentucky's elec
toral votes except one. It is claimed that he cannot
carry those States this year, and there are some seem
ingly sanguine Democrats who declare he will lose
New York also. \
There are 447 votes in the Electoral College, and
it will require 224 votes to elect. The Chicago Times-
Herald figures that Bryan will have this year the 176
votes he received in 1S96, and in addition thereto may
carry New York, with thirty-six votes,* Kentucky,
with twelve in addition to the one given for him be
fore, and Maryland with eight. -This would give
Bryan 232 votes and elect him. In fact, he would not
need the Maryland vote if he carried the other two.
Sanguine Republican experts estimate that Bryan
will not only gain nothing this year, but will lose
many of the votes he received four years ago. In an
estimate published some weeks ago General Grosve
nor conceded Bryan only 174 votes. A Republi
can estimate made during the Philadelphia conven
tion concedes to Bryan only 161 votes and claims for
McKinley 2S6.
Such estimates make no allowance for doubtful
States, but it is not to be denied that some of them
are doubtful. The only question is what States are
to be considered so. The New York World says
Bryan has 196 votes sure and McKinley 168 votes
sure, and it puts New York, Indiana. Ohio and Min
nesota, with a total of 83 votes, as doubtful. It gives
Kentucky, Maryland and West Virginia as sure for
Bryan, and in that -respect runs directly contrary to
the Philadelphia estimate that each of those States is
sure for. McKinley.
Perhaps the most trustworthy calculation yet made
is that of the New York Commercfal, as follows:
CALCULATING THE CHANCES.
BOTH the great parties have now placed their
tickets and their platforms in the field. The
rival forces have been lined up. It is to be an
other contest . between McKinley and Bryanâ
of prosperity against discontent. There has been a
vast change in the conditions of business and industry
since .the former contest, and some change there, will
be in the issues presented to the voters. Consequently
there is more or less uncertainty as to what the re
sults of the changes will be, and political experts are
beginning to speculate concerning them.
with popular desire at times, but there have been no
scandals of jobbery or extravagance charged against
any of the Commissioners. It has been an indepen
dent board in the past, and the charter has wisely con
tinued" it so. Moreover, it is evident the men who
now compose the board will have the courage to
maintain its independence. They will employ the
funds appropriated for parks as seems to them most
expedient for the improvement of the public pleasure
grounds, and the attempted dictation- from the City
Hall will be as futile- as it was. foolish,

A PIONEER OF YOLO
Was Well Known In Republican Political
Circles and Father of the Freeman
Freights and Fare Bill.
Ian*, all of which Is now within the city
limits of Woodland. He was, the proprietor of
the first store in Woodland, and was the first
Postmaster and express agent He was one
of the original founders of the Bank of Wood
land and held the office of vice president con
tinuously until about two years ago. when he
was compelled to retire on account of ill-health.
Major Freeman cast his second vote for
Abraham Lincoln and was ever afterward an
active and influential Republican. He was
elected to the Assembly In 1870 and re-elected
In 1372. During; his second term he introduced
the famous "Freeman's Freights and Fare
Bill." He was also the candidate of the mi
nority party for Speaker. His fight for the
famous bill that bore his name gave him such
a State Â¦ reputation that there was a strong
movement in 1874. by both Republicans and In
dependents, to nominate him for Governor, but
he declined to allow his name to be used.
In October. 1S37, Mr. FVeeman was married
to Miss Gertrude G. Swatn. a niece of Mrs. C.
W Crocker. Their only child, Lillian. Is now
th* wife of John Eackie of this county. The
funeral will probably be held on Tuesday under
the auspices of the Masonic fraternity.
WOODLAND. July 8.â Hon. T. 8.
Freeman died on his farm near
Woodland at 3:30 this morning. He
had been in falling health for two
years. Last Friday he lapsed into
unconsciousness and continued in
that condition until' the end, as if In a peaceful
sleep.
Major Freeman was a native of Kentucky and
was born December 25. 1S32. His parents moved
to Missouri when he was but little over a year
old. At the> age of 14 he was appointed to a

The Alameda cricketers did not make a
very good start against the Pacifies yes
terday on the "Webster-street grounds,
Alameda, three wickets being- down for
ten runs. The veteran Moriar.ty, how
ever, put a different 'complexion on af
fairs, scoring sixty-eight runs. He was
ably assisted by Harold Ward, who com
piled twenty-eight. No other batsman
made double rlgures. the innings closing
for 129 runs. Five Pacific bowlers were
tried of whom Coles and Cassldy took
three' wickets each.
None of the Pacific batsmen stayed long
enough at the wickets to get set, Cole3
and Myers making only ten runs between
them. Cassidy (11)' and D. Jamieson (13)
were the only men to obtain double fig
ures. Harold Ward did great execution
with the ball, no fewer than eight wick
ets falling to his credit. F* Croll took
the remaining two, and the innings closed
for 44 runs. 85 below the Alameda total.

unbroken succession has the German and

"Bad Boy** Bodie. Stockton's substitute
for "One Lamp" Locknead, may have
frightened Whalen out of his curves and

for the local batsmen in the afternoon.
Whalen pitched both the morning and aft
ernoon matches, with equal non-success.
There is an excuse for his afternoon per

MORNING GAME.
San Francisco 7, Stockton 1.
Mr. Whalen was responsible for the third
consecutive Victory cf Frisco over the Mil
lers at Oakland yesterday morning-. Out
of seven runs the responsibility for five
rests upon Whalen. The sixth and eighth
Innings won the game for Hank. In the
Fixth Vv'halen went bad. and in the eighth
worse. Three hits and as many runs in
Hank's first luck inning and four men
over the rubber with three hits in the
eighth did the victory job for Hank be
yond all question.
Fireman Fltz was at the hose for the
local team, and he pitched unsolvable
curves. But four hits were made off hi?
delivery, and none of these came together.
But what Frisco was rich in was a bunch
of five errors, although in no rase costly.
SAX FRANCISCO.
Krup carried off the batting honors of
thÂ»Â» day. He was the only man in the
team who won the distinction of swatting
out more than a single. A three-badger
and a <1ouble constituted Krug's record at
the bat. A few double plays added inter
est to rhf came, which was of hferh qual
ity but for the weakening' of Whalen in
the two Innings, which were "happy
thoughts" for Hark Harris, now no longer

FOUR STRAIGHT
VICTORIES FOR
THE LOCAL NINE
The wise ones received quite a shock In
the deciding round of the open stake at
Union Coursing x'ark yesterday. Royal
Flush, an overnight favorite for the stake
and on whose chances the talent made a
heavy play. In the final course was beat
en, and on merit, too, by P. J. Reilly's
The Grafter. Six to one were the odds
qiioted when the doga went to the slips.
The Grafter had the foot on Flush and
was gaining when both dogs went un
sighted. Flush went back a point in the
betting, but still many got their money
down on him for the next trial. The sec
ond race was a repetition of the first, in
asmuch as The Grafter took the lead and
was never headed until the kill. Point
after point he scored until he rolled up
eighteen. .In front of the grand stand he
held the lead until the game ran close to
the fence. Here he hesitated, and Flush
took the turn and kill, making his only
ocore. Every one voted the race a fine
exhibition. The Grafter's wins were:
Beat McKinley 6â2, Sylvanus 11â6, Rosle
Claire 10â0, Whitehead 4â3, and In the
sixth round beat Twin City Girl, a fresh

THE results of the autopsy per
formed by Dr. T. B. "\V. Leland on
the body of Paul Stadie. the Palace,
Hotel suicide, has aroused great in
dignation at the character of the treat
i ment given the unfortunate man. The ln
; quest, which will probably be held to
morrow morning, mav "be expected to
Â¦ determine whether Stadie died from mor
phine poisoning or was boiled to death.
Dr. Leland, the autopsy surgreon, Bays
that the man was scalded as a hog is
pcaided to remove the skin and hair to
gether; that the epithelium peeled off
from two-thirds of the body, and that It
is more probabl* that death was due to
the shock resulting from the scalding
than from the effects of the poison swal
lowed by the would-be suicide.
Dr. J. Albert Noble, the physician who
prescribed the hot bath and left the giv
ing of it to the two hotel painters, who
had been hastily summoned from their
buckets and step-ladders. Is sure that
Stadie died from morphine poisoning. He
asserts that it was the beating with tow
els, not parboiling, that stripped the body
of three-fourths of the outer layer of
ekln and left the sensitive, true skin ex
posed, with the blood oozing from the
pores. He denies his .responsibility for
the effect of the hot bath In any case, on
the ground that he left that part of It
to the painters. He told them to give the
man a hot bath, and supposed they were
intelligent enough not to Imitate hog
scalding- If they put the unconscious
man into boiling water, Dr. Noble asserts,
the responsibility does not rest with him.
Dr. Leland filled in the autopsy blank as
follows:
Cause of death â morphine poison
ing (P) shock, due to extensive burn
ing of body.
"We have had a great many cases of
morphine poisoning at the Morgue." Dr.
Leland said last evening, "but I have
never seen such a sight as this body is.
Three-fourths of Its surface is denuded of
the epithelium. There is no doubt in the
world that the hot batn caused the
ploughing off of the skin. The water
must have been scalding hot and actod
just as it does Â¦when hops are scalded and
the hair scraped off.
"The analysis of the stomach will show
whethe/ morphine or other poison was
present in sufficient quantity to produce
death. In my opinion the shock from tha
!=caidlngr of the skin and the exposure of
the dermis sufficiently account for the
man's death.
"I have never seen a case of morphine
poisoning where the skin sloughed off as
the result of poisoning. In this case the
scalding water did It. There can be no
question of that."

SLUMP IN STOCKS.
Effect of the Chinese Trouble on the
Markets.
LONDON. July 8.â The sole concern of
the Stock Exchange now Is China. The
sudden drop in Chinese bonds during the
week Just ended upset a number of loans
secured by the deposit of 'these securities,
and forced heavy selling of others In order
to provide funds to supply lost margins.
Hence there was a heavy slump all along
the line, which in spite of a subsequent
rally left its traces on all the markets,
consols losing one point. Chinese securi
ties were lower for the week in spite of
the fact that the installment of Interest
for 1S99 was duly paid in by the Shanghai
banks.
Americans have been the best market
of the week. Berlin selling has been offset
by New York buying. Prices, except for
iJouisville and Nashville, closed fraction
ally higher on the week. Mining securities
were depressed, Rands being lVi down.
Money was fairly plentiful at 1 to 1*4 per
cent for call loans and 1% per cent for
loans for a week. Discounts were firm at
Â£i: to 2'i4 uer cent.
THREE MORE BODIES
FOUND IN THE SAALE
Charred Remains of Victims of the
Terrible Fire Taken From the
Burned Steamer.
NEW YORK. July 8.â Three more
bodies were found to-day on the Saale.
This makes twenty-nine bodies that have
thus far been taken from the wreck of the
steamer since the fire and 146 bodies fn all
recovered. The bodies recovered to-day
were found in the second cabin.- in the aft
erpart of the ship and they were
horrible sights to look upon. They had
very little clothing on and 'were all vic
tims of fire. They could not be identi
fied.
Chief Officer Hanry Schaeffer, who was
In charge to-day, said he had no Idea who
the men had been, but, judging from the
place they were found, he thinks they
were stewards. "
The body of a man badly scarred and
burned was found at Rockaway Beach
this afternoon and taken to the morgue
there. The body is supposed to be that of
a victim of the Hoboken disaster.
Dynamite was exploded on the river bed
about the wrecks of the piera of the
North German Lloyd line to-day without
bringing to the surface any more bodies.

HAVANA, July 8.â The orders recently

The Tenth Infantry, it is believed, will

Minister Conger's Report.
LEGATION OF THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
PEKING. May 21, 1300.
To the Hon. John Hay, Secretary of State,
Washington â Sir: I have the honor to confirm,
on thÂ« overleaf, my cipher telegram of to-day.
In response to the French Minister the dean
called a meeting of the diplomatic corps yes
terday, and upon Information furnished In a
letter from the Catholic Bishop in Veking and
verbal reports by the other Ministers the situ
ation was considered so grave that the corps
Immediately- instructed the dean to present it
to the Tsur.g L.1 Tamen and demand immediate
and effective measures, which he did to-day by
the note, a copy of which Is inclosed.
I *.:Â» j Inclose copies of the Bishop's letter and
on* from Rev. Mr. KlUie, an American mission
ary, who lives in Peking, but travels a. circuit
to the north and east.
On the lUh inst.. during an extended per
sonal interview with the Tsung 1A Yamen, I
called their attention to the fact that, notwith
standing constant warnings from this and other
legations, the Boxers had continually increased
and epread until now they are boldly organ
izing inside thÂ« walls of Peking, the existence
of thousands is known in the villages around
Peking. Christian converts are being perse
cuted and threatened everywhere, many forced
to recant their religious profession, and some
hava been compelled to abandon their chapels
and come to Peking for safety.
I said: "At a London mission near Chou
Chow, forty miles west cf Peking, two native
Christians have been killed and their chapel de
stroyed. Near Pao Tir.g Fu a Catholic village
has been destroyed and sixty-one Christians
murdered, some of them being burned alive.
The foreirn Governments cannot longer sit idly
by and witness this persecution and murder. I
can only epeak fcr ray own Government, but It
ic becoming very impatient over China's con
tinued treaty violations. It always has been
Â¦ r.d ettll Is the good friend of China, and only
wishes It prcrperlty, but is now more than ever
determined to sustain the treaty rights of all
American citizens and of the Christian converts
and 1t will hold the Chinese Government to the
strictest accountability for every treaty infrac
tion in thi* regard. It will do this, not only
tor th* benefit of its own citizens, but in the
interest of China herself, whose Government
it now eadly threatened by these lawless or-
Kanlzatione. At present, it is true, they seem
to have no capable leader, but should one arise
and the populace become really inflamed, the
overthrow of the pr^ent dynasty is most likely
to follow ar.d ;>oÂ£s;bly the destruction of the
empire" etc.
Promises of Protection.
They replied that I did not understand the
many difficulties under which they labored, but
tljey had *ucoeedÂ»>d in suppressing the Boxer*
in the province of Shantung tod would do so
here.
I told them I raw no effective measures what
rver being put forth. They replied that the
movement had not heretofore been looked upon
nr Â«eriouÂ»: but thrraght now the throne was
aware of the gravity of the situation and that
a tetent consent ial decree had been sent to
the Viceroy, the Peking and neighboring offl
â¢ ifcl*. which would surely prove effective, sup
press the Boxers and restore order.
I told them that the most alarming telegrams
were bÂ»ins sent to the newspapers of Europe
*nd America of the existing state of anarchy
herc and tbat the people of the world would be
forced to believe that the Government of China
was either abetting these murderous brigand*
ct that It w-aÂ« tw. wrak to suppress or cortrrl
them, and its good name and credit must suffer
Irretrievably 1n renffiiuenre. After reading me
the decree, which v>.Â«Â« much like those hereto
fore published, they arked If I would not wire
my Government* that they cculd and were sup
piepning the Hoxera.
I rÂ»-plUÂ»d that at present I would not: that I
had been for six month* t'legraphinic the issu
ance of ineffective decrees, but If they would
*how me the fact by actual and Immediate
repression, which they could if they would. In
thrt-e days. I would gladly and quickly wire it
to my Government.
They assured me that roffieient troops had
been bent to the disturbed districts to restore
order and to afford protection. Â¦.- Â¦Â¦â¢-
I strain told them that restored prder would
be the only *>osi<lb!e proof. I also said that
unless the situation was relieved and the
threatening danger from mobs averted I should
t>e compelled tc aslc for a sufficient number cf
American marine* to Insure the safety of the
lejrat^n.
Ttey Mid; "Oh, don't do that; U Is coneccs-
sary." And, again promising energetic action.
Â¦ the Interview closed.
Unless some energetic action is taken the
situation will become fraught with great dan
ger to all foreigners, not from any Intelligent
or organized attacks, but from ignorant and
inflamed mob violence. I. however, believe, as
I said in my telegram, that the Government is
aroused, itself alarmed at the situation, and
will take more energetic action; but no one
can be certain of this until it 1b done.
Since the United States sh'- Wheeling had
left already for Taku, I deemed it prudent to
ask the admiral for the presence of another
warship, and, responding to the request, Ad
miral Kempff with the Newark sailed hither
from Yokohama on the lsth lnst. and should
arrive soon.
I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient
Servant, , B. H. CONGER.

Bishop IVvier's Warning.
Mr. Minister: From day to day the situation
becomes more serious and threatening. In the
prefecture of Pao Ting Fu more than seventy
Christians have been massacred: In Echao
Icheou only three days ago three neophytes nave
been cut to pieces. Many villages have been
pillaged and burned: a great many others have
been completely abandoned.
More than 2000 Christians are fleelnpr without
bread, without clothing, without .shelter. At
Peking alone about 100 refugees â men. women
and childrenâ are already lodged at our house
and that of the Sifters; before eight days we
will rrobably have many thousands.
We will have to dismiss the echools and the
col)efceÂ«, also use nil the hospitals to make
room for theee unfortunate people.
Upon the east of us pillage and incendiarism
are imminent. ' We are hourly receiving the
most alarming news. Peking: is surrounded on
all sides. The Boxers are dally comlnjr nearer
the capital, delayed only by the destruction
which they are makin? of Christians.
Believe, I pray you, Mr. Minister, that I am
well informed and say nothing llphtly.
For us here at the Pal tang the day is prac
tically ended. AH the city knows It; everybody
if) speaking of It and a popular outbreak is
manifest.

JACKSON, July 8.â Dr. Kndlcott, local
health officer, with Dr. Luke of Sacra
mento, member of the State Board of
Health, assisted by local physicians, made
a thorough canvass of the town and vicin
ity to-day In the matter of the smallpox
epidemic. They report twenty-nine de
veloped cases with two or three others ap
parently in the process of incubation.
All cases are of a mild type, except two,
and with these It Is thought the crisis
has been passed. The officials are doing
all in their power to get the disease under
control. The extreme mildness of the dis
ease in the first cases misled many as to
the real character of the outbreak, result
ing in failure to take needed precautions,
until the existence oâ¬ a severe case re
vealed the seriousness of the situation.
All the infected houses are strictly quar
antined and guarded by. day and night.
A trained nurse from San Francisco ar
rived this evening under engagement of
the Native Daughters to attend the worst
case, Mrs. Ida Peek, a member of the
order. A public meeting was held in the
Courthouse this afternoon when the
citizens unanimously resolved to uphold
the officials in adopting all lawful meas
ures to stamp out the pestilence. Reports
have been circulated that the entire town
would be quarantined but the officials
have no such intention. It is generally
believed the worst period of the epidemic
has been passed.
Of the Twenty-Nine Sufferers All but
Two Have the Disease in a Mild
Form and Its Spread
Is Not Feared.
Thorough Investigation Is
Made by the Health
Officers.

Democrats Hopeful That, Should He
Fail to Withdraw, Fusion Will
Be Accomplished.
LINCOLN, Nebr., July 8.â No formal
announcement will be made by Charles
A. Towne of his decision In regard to the
Populist nomination for the Vice Presi
dency until the Populist committee gives
him formal notification of the nomination.
This will be in about ten days. Mr.
Towne said to-day that he would make
public his decision at that time, and
would Issue an address giving his reasons
for the action he takes. What that ac
tion would be he refused to say.
"But my course is perfectly clear now,"
Mr. Towne added. "I have already
talked the matter over with sev
eral of the Populist leaders. The
&ubject will also probably come up,
though in an informal way, at to-mor
row's meeting of the advisory committee."
Senator J. K. Jones, chairman of the
Democratic National Committee, arrived
here from Kansas City this evening and
later held an extended conference with
Mr. Bryan, Charles A. Towne and George
Fred Williams. In talking about the Vice
Presidential situation Senator Jones said
he hoped and believed that in case Mr.
Towne withdrew his name as a Populist
candidate for the Vice Presidency the
national committee of that party would
indorse the Democratic ticket.
"We are all independent," said Senator
Jones, "and like to carry to a successful
conclusion our plans. But this year
every one who Is not with the Republican
party should be against them, and I can
not help thinking that every man who is
in earnest in his desire for the success of
W. J. Bryan should unite with us. Of
course, If Mr. Towne does not withdraw
fusion on the electoral tickets of the vari
ous States should and probably will be
.arranged."
Senator Jones will leave for Chicago to
morrow night.
During to-morrow's conference, at
which Senator Jones, Senator Heltfeld, J.
R. Sovereign. Senator Allen and Chairman
Edmlston of the Populist National Com
mittee are expected to be present, the
Vice Presidential complication will be
considered In all its phases. At this meet
ing It Is also expected that plans for con
centrated effort In State and Congres
sional campaigns, which was practically
agreed upon at the meeting of the con
ference* committee of the Democratic
Silver Republican and Populist parties in
Kansas City, will be completed. Should
Mr. Towne decide to withdraw his name
from the Populist ticket this would leave
the way clear for uniting the three parties
in the support of the Democratic national
tlcKet. A strong effort will be made to
brine about this result through the Podu
list National Committee. Populist Na
tional'Committeemen are. It Is understood
far from being unanimous In their opin
ions as to the wisest course to pursue In
case Mr. Towne decides to withdraw, but
those of the Populist conferees who are
already in the city expressed their belief
to-day that an understanding, involving
the working in harmony of the three
parties In the coming Presidential cam
paign, would be reached before the ad

"The next night we were ready for the
red devils from the 'Land of Fire.' The
chief engineer had all the metal staunch
eons and every piece of iron that the na
tives could touch if they attempted to
come aboard connected with the dynamo,
and the current was kept going all night
long. One native touched a live wire, but
all we know about the matter was the
shriek of agony that came up out of the
darkness. For four days and nights we
were on the rack.Â« During the day the
natives would come alongside and want
to trade, but we kept them off. At night
they hovered around us like silent spec

blaze aft, which we poon put out. but
after that there was no sleep at nights
for any one. The Terra del Fuegans keep
a fire in their canoes all the year round
and when the father dies or fs Incapaci

alongside of a ship and lighting a torch
at the fire they silently throw it through
a porthole. Should the vessel catch fire
they make an attack while all hands are
engaged in fighting the flames, and If the
fire has gained any headway the end
comes sooner or later. The sailors are
either slaughtered while escaping in the
boats or are murdered aboard the vessel.
A year ago a Chilean gunboat was set
on more than one occasion. During the
last hurricane, two steers and their pens,
w-hich had been presented to the ship by
Chllenos at Punta Arenas, were washed
overboard, and that ended the supply of
fresh meat. â¢
When the western end of the straits
was reached instead of standing out to
sea Captain O'Brien turned into Smyth
Channel. The Terra del Fuegans now
began to make trouble.

"There was trouble enough aboard, God
knows," said Purser Hume yesterday,
"but these natives kept our hearts in our
mouths all the time. The second night
we were in Smyth Channel the alarm of

among the crew. Soon after getting un
der way three stowaways were found In
the steward's department. It was then
blowing a gale and the captain could not
put back to land them. It would have
been better for all hands had he done so.
The next day one of the men who had
been shipped at Saint Lucia recognized
the men. One he said was a notorious
bandit. Another was an escaped mur
derer and the third was a lunatic. Cap
tain O'Brien's informant had been a po
liceman In the Barbadoes and he said
there was a hue and cry all over the West
Indies after these men.
Chief Steward Edward Palmer, rein
forced by these desperadoes, now began
to show himself. The third day out he
got into a squabble with a fireman named
McAllister and nearly killed him with a
heavy chair. Palmer is a burly negro,
and had not the engineers driven trim
back at the point of their pistols he
would have assuredly" killed the fireman.
As It was six stitches had to be taken In
the fireman's scalp and he was laid up for
the remainder of the voyage. From that I
time on there was nothing but trouble
aboard, and several times the blacks
arose and attempted to overpower the
whites.
A Dozen in Irons.
When the Dolphin arrived at Montevi
deo there were a dozen Saint Lucians !n
irone, while the chief steward had been
disrated, and was under surveillance. Cap
tain O'Brien appealed to the United
States Consul at Montevideo for assist
ance. He wanted to leave his mutinous
men ashore, but the Consul would not
have It that way and said he must take
the men to the first American port, which
meant, to all Intents and purposes, the
ship's destination.
Soon after leaving Montevideo the Dol
phin ran Into a pampero and everything
movable on deck was washed away. On
reaching Punta Arenas, at the entrance
to the Straits of Magellan, they found
that the town had nearly been wiped out
of existence by the Patagonians. The
natives had made a descent upon . the
place, killed fourteen of the Chilano sol
diers and set fire to the buildings. A del
egation came out from the post, and after
telling their woes to Captain O'Brien
afked for some firearms and powder. The
captain presented them with a three-Inch
gun and a quantity of ammunition. In
return the Chllanos sent two boatloads
of fruit, vegetables and fresh meat.
The passage through the straits was at
tended with many risks, and twice the
ship was swept from stem to stern. The
wllliwas came down from the mountains
and almost carrietS the ship to destruction
after dark. "When we went ashore Consul
Downs advised us to go armed and keep
a close lookout. He said that three days
before he had been attacked and had to
kill the would-be assassin in self-defense.
Fell Among Cutthroats.
"To explain what fonows I have to go
back to New York. George G. Carroll,
the second assistant engineer, is the own
er of a fine revolver, which he had loaned
to a friend. It was returned to him on
sailing day. loaded and all ready for use
apparently. When wo went ashore Car
roll put this gun In his hip pocket ami I
did the same with mine. On our way
back to the ship I was a little in advance
and hurrying. Suddenly something
dropped beside Carroll,' and when ha
looked over h!s shoulder he saw a dozen
leprous looking natives coming toward
him. while In the wooden sidewalk at h!3
feet quivered a long knife with a short
yellow handle. Carroll at once drew hi3
gun and threatened the crowd with it.
They fell back a few paces and he started
on his way to the boat again. The na
tives then started for him on the run and
Carroll attempted to fire his pistol into
the mob. Five times he snapped the trig
ger and five times the gun refused to go
off. With a cry of 'mucho malo 1 the na
tives made for Carroll with their knives
drawn.
"Luckily a few seconds before I had
made a remark to Carroll, and getting no
answer had turned around to see what
was the matter. Seeing the peril my
comrade was in. I at once ran to his as
sistance and fired two shots into the
crowd. Two men fell and that stopped
their advance. While they were con
sulting we turned and ran and the natives
followed. At the next corner I fired an
other shot into them and Carroll snapped
his useless gun five times more. To make
a long story short, we got aboard in safe
ty, and not a man ventured ashore again
while the vessel was in port. An Investi
gation of Carroll's pistol showed that his
friend had broken tne pin off the ham
mer and the gun, was as useless as a pieca
of scrap iron.

"An hour before we left Smyth Channel
the natives came alongside and one of the
men bought a small pig for four empty
tomato tins and a jackknife. He got the
porker aboard all right, but as he was
leading it forward to the slaughter it got
away, a pig hunt followed, but after
knocking every table in the dining saloon
down and mixing up every man on the
ship the porker made his escape through
a side port and was picked up by the
waiting Terra del Fuegans. The man who
made the purchase swears the animal
was trained. He never saw his pig or hi3
tomato cans again.
''We arrived at Coronel on June 14 and
then the trouble aboard broke out into
an open rupture. It rained all that day
and no coaling cpuld be done. The fire
men and coal passers seized the oppor
tunity to set drunk and the negro cooks
and waiters followed suit. When the two
met on the main deck there was a clash
and the negroes got the worst of it. They
soon turned the tables, however. They
seized the fire axes and dared the whites
to come on. Led by the chief steward
the Saint Lucians drove the firemen and
coal passers into the riggrlnp. The negroes
then began cutting the ship's decks and
standing rigging, so Captain O'Brien sent
ashore in a hurry for assistance.
United States Consul J. Henry Downs
appealed to the authorities and they sent
a train ten miles into the interior for a
detachment of troops. The troops arrived
a few hours later and were sent aboard
the Dolphin, where they had a hard time
of it subduing the mutineers. Chief
Steward Palmer and five more of the
ringleaders were taken ashore and locked
up In the calaboose. Among the ring
leaders -were the bandit, the raurderer
and the supposed crazy man. They were
tried on June 17 and each of them was
given three months in the mines, which
is equal to three years penal servitude in
the United States. Had the ringleaders
been sent back aboard by the authorities
not an officer would have gone out on
her, as the Saint Lucians had evidently
made all their plans to capture the vessel
and murder the whites.
"While in port some of us determined
to take a run ashore. Such a place I have
never seen in my life. One-half of the
people are lepers and the other half are
murderers and cutthroats. They kill for
the sake of killing, and a man with a
decent suit on has not a ghost of a show
for his life if he appears on the streets

numerous accidents mark the trip of
the steamer Dolphin from New York
to San Francisco as -one of the most
remarkable made in many years from
the east to the west coast of America.
At one time half the crew Â¦was in Irons
and at another many of the firemen and
coal passers had to take refuge in the
ripping while the negro cooks and stew
ards stood below with fire axes ready to
cut away the standing: rigging and allow
the rn&sts to go by the board and drown
the whites. The military authorities at

sent East to bring the vessel to the coast.
The Dolphin Is not built for ocean travel.

out before the inspectors of hulls and
boilers would let her leave port. Then
Captain O'Brien had considerable diffi

have taken in any other circumstances.
Some of the men did not show up on sail

began.

v.hich, tested the weatherly qualities of
the chip to the utmost and satisfied the
crew hat she could live In any kind of
â¢weather. The forecastle, however, proved
to be almost uninhabitable, owing to the
quantity of water that found its way be

O'Brien brought all the forward hands

Rev. William Hader Delivers a Dis
course on the "Puzzle of
Prayer."
"The Puzzle of Prayer" was the topic
of the sermon of Rev. William Rader at
the Third Congregational Church yester
day morning.
1 "Men pray more out of necessity," he
said "It Is not their duty or conscience
that makes them pray. When General
Grant was on his deathbed General How
ard came and saw him. ''Can't you tell
me about prayer?' was Grant's request.
The prayer of man does not determine the
mind of God. The divine creator does that
which in his great power he thinks best
for us. Take the Boer and English sol
diers They both prayed to God to bring
them victory. They both sincerely thought
that they were In the right. We must
leave it to God. and he will answer our
prayer in the way he thinks fit."

Father MacCorry Preaches
a Stirring Sermon at
St. Mary's.
"The Power of Lltjle Things" was the
.subject of the Rev. Father MacCorry's
sermon at St. Mary's Church last evening.
The reverend father opened his discourse
with a short description of Moses' wonder
ful miracles with the rod. He drew his
listeners' attention to the fact that great
deeds can be- accomplished by small en
deavors. "People with small talents have
done some of the greatest things of the
day," he said. Father MacCorry paid a
glowing tribute to the late evangelist.
Moody.
"This man made a vow," -he said. "He
determined that he would speak to at least
one man a day on the subject of salva
tion. After making that vow he lived long
enough to speak to 18^30 people individu
ally, and we cannot imagine how many
hearts he touched In this way. I was
holding a mission recently In the country
and a lady attended one of the services.
I met 'her and asked her if she was a
Sunday-school teacher. She replied in the
affirmative, and told me" that she had a
class of five small boys. She said that she
thought that they were young urchins or
she would not have postponed school that
day. She wanted to hear the mission.
How foolish she acted. That afternoon
she might have spoken something that
would have appealed to the hearts of
those five young urchins. They might
have grown .up devout men and they
might have gone into the world and saved
hundreds of lives from sin. Look at a
small acorn. It Is insignificant, but if it
Is -planted In good ground It will make a
large oak tree."
The Rev. Father Hannlgan preached the
sermon at the vesper service at St. Mary's
Cathedral. He said in part:
"The world has to a certain extent come
under the influence of Christianity. Tet a
great many men only profess the Christian
faith with their lips.- They Confine them
selves to one or more virtues. They think
that If a man does his duty to the world
that is enough. There is no appre
hension on his part, no sense of self-con
demnation. Such, my friends, Is the re
ligion of the man of the world to-day. It
is beautiful on the surface, but is not good
in the sight of God. "We may not all sin
in the same degree. The Pharisees lived
on the surface; they lived up to the letter
of the law; they were acceptable to them
selves, so they thought they were accept
able In the sight of God. The Christian
should know that there Is only one way
to happiness. He should know that there
Is one to whom he owes everything." Such
Is the basis of true religion."
"We should all obey God's command to
love our enemies." said the Rev. Father
Sasia at the evening vesper service at St.
Ignatius Church. "From the day that the
angels sang 'Glory to God In the highest
and on earth peace and good will toward
men' till the present day that has been
one of the laws that all Chrustians should
act up to. This is a commandment of sin
cere love. Do not carry any revengeful
thoughts or wish your neighbor injuries.
God is the avenger of your wrongs and
will act for you. He commands that we
banish all unkind thoughts from our
minds. Again, In another part of the holy
book he says, 'Revenge Is mine; I will re
venge.' "

malned of the Louisiana purchaseâ a
vast tract stretching from the Indian Ter
ritory to Oregon. That bill, drawn in
the ordinary form, said nothing about
slavery. The Missouri compromise was un
derstood to have made free sol. forever of
all that region. Pro-slavery members nat
urally opposed the bill and were able to
prevent its passage through the upper
! house. When the same bill came up in the
next Congress it was referred by the Sen
ate to the Committee on Territories, of
which Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois was
chairman. His report, made in January.
1854 was a startling one.- It opened anew
the great dispute and gave a new and un
foreseen turn to the old contest
This report presented the original bill
with amendments which Incorporated a
new and far-reaching discovery of the
brilliant Senator. The compromises of
1S50, by which the Territories of Utah and
New Mexico were admitted to organiza
i tion left the question of slavery to be de
i cided by the people of those .Territories.
I That action was now declared by Senator
Douglas to be the adoption of a principle
universal In its application to the Terri
tories of the United States. "Henceforth,
said he, "all questions pertaining to slav
ery in the Territories and in the new
States to be formed therefrom are to be
left to the people residing therein." Thus
i an act of Congress, passed for a specific
â¢ purpose, was pronounced a great consti
tutional rule applicable to the whole coun
try and restricting the action of all sub
seauent Congresses. This novel interpre
tation of the legislation of 1850 wholly re
moved the subject of slavery from Con
gressional control and placed It with the
settlers of the Territories. It established,
as its author set forth Ih his powerful
final speech upon the bill, the just and
logical principle of true democracy, "popu
lar sovereignty," and the non-interference
of Congress with the institution of slav
erv The Missouri compromise was prac
tically annulled and slavery in the Terri
tories of the Louisiana purchase became
once more an open question. Dlxon of
Â¦ Kentucky moved an amendment definitely
repealing that part of the Missouri com
promise relating to slavery, and this Dou
glas incorporated into a new draft of hl3
bill, and in Its final form the bill divided
the Nebraska tract into the two Terri
tories Kansas and Nebraska, declared the
fugitive slave law to apply to both, and the
Missouri compromise, so far as it con
cerned slavery, to be inoperative and void
as Inconsistent with the principle of non
intervention by Congress with slavery In
the States and Territories, as recognized
by the legislation of 1S50. - Â¦ ;.
The Northern press was quick to see the
bearing of the commlttee f s report. "Slav
ery takes the field." the newspapers an
nounced to their anxious readers. Severe
reflections were cast upon the motives of
the author of the movement. The Demo
cratic party had no abler member than
the "Little Giant" from Illinois. It was
plain that this voluntary bringing forward
of the apple of discord was the result of
deliberate and careful purpose, and that
the support of the, administration must be
assured. Douglas aspired to lead his
1 party as Clay had lead the Whigs, and
he certainly sought its Presidential nomi
nation for 1S56. To that end he must have
the support of the South, with Its 120
electoral votes. Of the "West, his own sec

The enormous grape crop of Livermore
Valley, one of the chief vineyard centers
of California, has been saved from de
s-truciion. The Livermore Herald, after
a careful survey of the situation, has the
following report of the conditions:
"Early in the spring the vineyardists
of Livermore Valley were a discouraged
and disheartened lot of men. A succes
sion of dry seasons had affected the vines
seriously and a severe frost at a critical
stage left most of them without the hope
of a. crop and very dubious as to the
future ot their vineyards. Fortune smiled
upon them finally and showed her favor
in a peculiar way. â¢
"Early in May a shower of rain which
almost equaled a cloudburst in intensity
broke suddenly over that portion of the
valley where most of the vineyards are
located and in half an hour's time fully
an inch cf rain fell. A more opportune
ehower never descended. The languishing
vines revived and sent out new growth
and new- blossoms, and the growers whose
first crop was blighted by Jack Frost will
cet a very fair second crop, and they have
a cood show of wood for next year. This
is more marked in some vineyards than
others and while the crop will not be up
to the' average the situation generally is
far better than the most sanguine grower
had any hope for.
"The most remarkable case Is that of
Mont Rouge Vineyard, which the frost
had devasted to such an extent that no
crop was expected by Mr. Bon and he
even had fears that some of his vines
would not Burvlve the fteason. No vine
yard in the valley presents a more thrifty
appearance now than Mont Rouge and
Mr Bon informs us that he will have a
far better crop than that of last year."

Jesus," the pastor said, "and to him told
her sad story, is a narrative well known
to nearly all of us. The woman's daugh
ter was ill, and she, with her maternal
love, was anxious for our Savior to heal
her. There are several lessons to learn
from this story. First, to make no Issue
on unimportant things. Jesus did not
stop to reason with her and explain that
her daughter had insanity and not the
devil. It was a day when demonology en
tered Into everyhing. All diseases were
supposed to be the work of the devil.
Jesus took the case, and wasted no time
on unimportant things. It was a cure,
not a diagnosis.
"Secondly, faith is the great agency of
human uplifting. Faith that cannot stand
testing is not worth having. True faith
Is the principle of life and action. Again,
another lesson to be learned is that Jesus
ignored race prejudice. How dreadful is
that narrow-minded idea! Tou cannot
blame anybody for what they cannot
help."

DETECTIVES Dlnan and Wren have
made known the identity of the
man shot Saturday night by Alfred
Hubert while attempting to force
an entrance into the grocery store of D-
W. Tietien, East and Washington
streets. He proves to have been an old
offender named Luigl Ferrea, a notorious
petty larcenist and a criminal upon whom
the police of San Francisco have long had
an eye. His picture is in the Rogues'
Gallery of the Police Department and his
record is of the worst. .
On November 9, 1894, he was held to
answer in the police courts on a charge
of burglary, having entered a shoe-store
on Broadway, near Stockton street. On
February 16, 1S95, he was sent to the
Preston School of Industry for two years.
At that time he claimed he was but 19
years of age, in order to escape confine
ment in San Quentin. As an alias he fre
quently used the name of "Frank Wil
liams."
A sister of the dead burglar, Mrs.
August Garibaldi, who resides at 10

At this dark hour the Republican party
was born. The name was one which had
been associated with American politics al
most from the beginning of our national
history. It had never quite disappeared
from party nomenclature. Even yet the
Democrats claimed it as a part of their
official designation. It could not be ab
sent from the thought of any who con
templated a new party organization, and
It had been assumed In some of the
Northwestern States for the new State
party. For the new national party it
was adopted, as Greeley says, "almost
spontaneously."
In February, 1856. a delegate convention
met in Pittsburg and organized the Re
publican party. A long and able exposi
tion of its principles and purposes was
set forth, and a nominating convention
was called to meet In Philadelphia in
June. All who deprecated the repeal of
the Missouri compromise and favored
Congressional control of the Territories
were invited, but. only Delaware. Mary
land and Kentucky of the slave States
sent delegates. Into the Republican party
went the body of the free-soilers. among
whose leaders were Sumner, Chase, Julian,
Hale, Frank P. Blair and C. F. Adams:
the anti-slavery Whigs, among whom,
were Greeley, Thaddeus Stevens, Lincoln.

of the party, and only acted with it to

The Republican Party.
The situation in Kansas continued to ab
sorb attention. The President Issued In
December a special message which de
clared his intensely partisan attitude
against the free-soil movement. Acrid
debates in Congress, the assault upon
Charles Sumner by a Southern "fire
eater," the march of events in the distant
Territory where the deadly struggle drew
dally nearer to the fatal plunge into
bloody civil warâ all this continually
widened the sectional breach. The out
look was gloomy in the extreme.
Whig defeat of 1So2. None of them proved
effective until the Nebraska bill of 1S54
supplied the needed element for precipi
tating the moral and political earnestness
and purpose held in solution In the seeth
ing caldron of Northern sentiment. Po
litical action in several of the Northwest
ern States crystallized about the bill.
Free-soilers, Free Democrats, Anti-slav
ery Democrats and Abolitionists all be
came "anti-Nebraska" men. Local organ
izations began to .fuse their differences in
the white heat of indignation against the
Douglas bill. Ere long in all the North
western States a new party appeared, and
plans for national action were discussed.
On the 24th of May. the day before the
final passage of the Nebraska* bill, the
powerful New York Tribune of Horace
Greeley called for a "union of all the ele
ments of the opposition" to the nefarious
action of Congress. The autumn elections
of 1854 strengthened in the lower house the
opposition to the Administration.
A bill had passed the House In 1S53 for
giving a Territorial organization to Ne
braska, which then included what re-
Out of the clear sky came the thunder

by politicians of all parties to have been
definitely settled and removed from the
list of political problems by the com

whole of United States territory was par
celed out as open either to freedom or to

Pierce's Inaugural with complacency, and
in the selection of his Cabinet Southern
prejudices were thoughtfully regarded. The
elections of 1853 confirmed the party leaders
in the expectation of a long lease of prac
tically uncontested power. The Democrat
ic majority in each house of Congress was
large, and no effective opposition appeared
from any quarter.
Meantime the Democrats felt themselves
to be on the crest of the wave. Their fol-.
lowing, too. was swelled by Whig dissen
sions and failures. The new Democratic
President, suave and popular and using
after the accepted Democratic fashion all
the resources of his office for the party
advantage, seemed destined to cement
more closely the party of experience and
prestige and to carry it on to greater tri-
The election of 1S52 had shown the utter
incapacity of the Whig party to deal with
the political problems of the time. So com
plete was the party demoralization that
few believed It could ever again cope with
its formidable antagonist. The weak, half
hearted manner of its treatment of slavery
had alienated alike its anti-slavery adher
ents in the North and the strong Southern
element which opposed the Democratic
policy. The lack of genuine political and
moral convictions, coupled with a deficien
cy of political w'isdom and statesmanlike
foresight, was the disease of which the
Whig party died; or, to change the figures,
these were the rocks upon which the party
was split into fragments, the larger por
tion of which drifted into the stream of
Knownothingism. which was rapidly
spreading over the country, especially in
the Eastern States. The free soil party,
which called itself after 1S51 the Free De
mocracy, also gained accessions and
reached by 1S51 the height of Us Influence.
Its greatest strength was In the North
west, and its more sanguine members
hoped that Whiggery was to succeed Free

were uncertain. To the South then, fav
ors must be given.
A long and full debate in Congress made
clear to all the scope and probable effects
of the proposed legislation. The excite
ment- in the North grew even more in
tense. Throughout the winter and spring
public meetings without number were
held to express the bitter Indignation of
the people at being thus tricked and be
trayed. Petitions and remonstrances
flooded the truckling Congress. Press,
platform and pulpit united in efforts to
avert the disaster. The bill passed May
25 by a small majority In the House and a
large one in the Senate. Long before
plans had been set afoot for saving the
new Territory for freedom In the only way
which -would still be possible should the

Kansas were to determine its status as

flre-fig-hters responded. The night was one
of anxiety at the mines, for steadily and
fwiftly the fierce sweep was toward the
town. There was no sleep for Tesla's hun
dreds of dwellers, who felt that at any
minute their homes would be swept out of
existence. Men resorted to every avail
able expedient to drive back the roaring
billows of fire which were rolling down
the steep canyon scopes. For many hours
Tired and wearied miners pave battle and,
tv'.th success, checked the fires at the edge
of the great mining properties. Latest re
ports from Tesla indicate that the fireo
**re under control, but not extinguished.
The watch will not be recalled, nor will
the vigilant efforts of the townspeople be
relaxed until all danger is pan and prop
erty is deemed safe from damage.
The fire started from sparks thrown
from an engine which is operating a steam
shovel at a gravel pit near the town.
Over the dry hillsides the names had free
run and before warning of the danger
r-.uld be piven a tremendous start had
'"Â¦f obtained by the flames that were
Fwiftly burning brush and undergrowth.
Men were called out from the mines and
l>ack-flrlng was done to check the sweep
of flame. For forty-eight hours the fires
â¢which circled the big mining camp were
kept In check, but Thursday night a sud
den shifting of the wind started the flames
toward the town.
The town 0T Tesla. with the extensive
virks of the coal mines, has been threai
Â«m=>d with destruction by a great brush
;ire which for four days has been raging
m the slopes of Corral Hollow, surround
ing the town. For many miles along the
eastern slope? of the canyon the timber
and brush have been burnt out. and so
close to the settlement has the fire raged
that hundreds of men have been constant
ly fighting the flames which are licking
up everything in their path.

These exports should not be confounded
with those of that part of the State south
of Tehachapl, from whence are shipped
thousands of carloads of citrus fruits.
The railroad statistics show that there is
practically no demand for the deciduous
fruits of this State In the Southern States,
the movement of horticultural products
eastward through Sacramento being fully'
99 per cent of the total.
Taking Mr. Richardson's figures of car-'
load exports the total number of pounds
of California's luscious fruits sent to
tickle the palates of people beyond the
"Rockies" amounts to 202.000,000. These
7800 carloads, in plain, cold figures, do
not appear to amount to an astonishing
total, but when it is understood that they
represent a solid train of cars each carry
ing 26.000 pounds and extending fifty-nine
miles, a reasonably Intelligent idea of the
importance of the horticultural industry
of California can be formed.
"This ratio," said Mr. Richardson, drift
ing into progressive statistics, "runs up
into a great total, and amounts approxi
mately to about 7800 carloads. The falling
off in the latter part of the season is ac
counted for by the fact that the East
ern fruits come into the markets and
reduce the demand for the products of
the Golden State."
"The figures are certainly stupendous
and run into sums hardly comprehensi
ble," continued the gentleman. "The June
shipments averaged sixty carloads a day,
which accounts for 1S0O carloads in the
month. This means nearly 47,000,000
pounds <5f the early deciduous fruits, such
as apricots, plums and peaches. Then
comes the rush of the midsummer prod
ucts, which increases the exportation to
seventy carloads per day, and this move
ment lasts during July and August. This
means 4200 more carloads. Then the Sep
tember shipments drop back to about
sixty carloads per day.
"Aside from those directly Interested in
the industry comparatively few people
have a remote Idea of the Importance of
the frult-ralslng Industry of California
and the true definitions of the words sup
ply and demand," said Master of Trans
portation Richardson of the Southern
Pacific Company, referring to the pres
ent movement of deciduous fruits to the
Eastern markets, yesterday.

Surgeons and Police Think Thomas
Sullivan Was the Victim of a
Powerful Drug.
FOUND ON THE STREET IN
AN UNCONSCIOUS CONDITION
Holt lived at the Pacific Union Club.
? I s ? y ear s old and has been connected
with the Pennsylvania lines for the lass
twelve years. He Â¦ came here : from Chi
cago, in January,- 1899, as general agent
for the Pacific Coast. He has an aunt in
the city. the. widow of the late Judge
Holt. His parents livo in Paris, Ky.
511 Larkin street, was in the buggy with
Creely and he corroborated the statement
of the last named. E. J. Colter, a carrier,
living at 231G Pine street, and a man
named Hennig, living at 2716 California
street, saw the collision and handed trie
veterinary their cards, so that he could
call them as witnesses. T. J. Harrington
of Truck 5. stationed at FlUmore and Post
streets, also saw the accident and went
in the patrol wagon to the hospital. He
said that Creely was driving at a rapid
gait and Holt tried to. avoid a collision
by making a sort of detour, but was too
late. Â¦-â¢Â¦;
I was driving my old gray horse,"
said he, and he was going at his usual
ppeed. I saw the bicyclist coming, and
when I thought a collision was inevitable
I drew the horse toward the curb and
tried to stop him. The wheel struck the
horse's right foreleg, cutting open the
skin and the may fell backward against
the curb. He seemed to pull up and I
thought he would wait till I passed, but
he apparently changed his mind and
started across at a rapid ppeed. My horse
is lame from the blow, and that will show
that I did not run into him. I sincerely
hope he will get over it."
Mulford L. Pancoast, marble merchant,
Veterinary Creely drove to police head
quartrs and surrendered himself to Lieu
tenant Birdsall. He was booked on a
charge of battery and released on $10 cash
bail. He expressed deep regret at the
unfortunate accident, but said he was not
to blame.
The patrol wagon was summoned from
the O'Karrell-streef station and the un
conscious man was taken to the Receiving
Hospital, where Dr. Bunnell found that
there was a fracture at the base of the
skull and another on the side of the skull.
His secretary, J. Clerfayt, learned of , the
accident and hurried to the hospital. He
later made arrangements to have him
removed to the Waldeck, and Drs. Hunt
ington-and Richter called at the hospital
and saw him removed in a private ambu
lance. They will attend to the case. They
expressed the opinion that Mr. Holt was
in a critical condition.
Creely was driving north on Steiner
street in his buggy and Holt was riding
west on Post street on his way to the
park. There is a vacant lot on the north
east corner and each saw the other com
ing.' Holt seemed to hesitate for an in
stant and then put on speed with the in
tention of crossing ln front of the buggy.
He miscalculated his speed and his wheel
struck the right foreleg of the horse and
he was thrown from his wheel, the' back
of his head striking on the curbstone,
rendering him unconscious. Â¦
Jn? COLLISION between a horse
/lj\ driven by E. 8. Creely, veterinary
Jj surgeon, and a wheel ridden by
A. S. J. Holt. Pacific Coast agent
of the Pennsylvania lines, at Steiner and
Post streets yesterday, may result In the
death of Mr. Holt, as his skull was frac
tured in two places.

Clever Ruse Practiced by a
Persistent Thief Now
Under Arrest.
A clever capture was made by-Police
man E. F. Leonard and Special Offlc.-r
Porter in the California Market, at an
early hour yesterday morning. R. M.
Hanna, a long-sought-for thief, whose
methods of operation were novel in the
extreme, was taken in the act of .touching
a till in a cigar store., -He was armed
when the arrest was made and a chaise
of carrying concealed weapons, as well aa
larceny, was placed ngainst him at tha
California-street Police Station.
For the past two months the till in Ba
ron's cigar store as well as those in oth<T
places in the market have been repeatedly
robbed.. In many instances the loss was
heavy, but the perpetrator of the thefis
could not be discovered. The fact that
the cigar counter was protected by a lat
tice-work, which was never disturbed,
served only to deepen the mystery as to
the identity of the criminal, and it was
believed;? for a time that, the work was
that of some bne who had keys to the
locks or perhaps by trusted employes.
Saturday night special instructions were
given to watch for the^ thief and Leonard
and Porter patrolled the premises. Short
ly after midnight attention was attracted
to a young man in his shirt sleeves stand
ing against the outside of the cigar coun
ter. He was playing a harmonica and ap
parently unconcerned as to what trans
pired about him. As the policemen
watched they saw the man push his naked
arm through the wicket work that pro
tected the counter and, opening the till,
transfer its contents to his own pocket.
All this time he played the harmonica for
the purpose of diverting attention from
his work on thq till. '
The thief them walked into a restaurant
and was in-the act of washing hia hands
when the policemen seized him. A loaded
revolver was first taken rrom his posses
sion. The money In the till, to the
amount of $10, that had been marked,- was
all found in the prisoner's pocket. He
gave his name as It. M. Hanna, 21 years
of age, and until last Tuesday an em
ploye in a fruit stand in the market.
At the California-street Station Hanna
was confronted by the' proprietor. of the
robbed till. He confessed to the theft
and in addition to the $10 found upon his
person admitted to having stolen $15 on
theprevlous week and $13 on the week be
fore that. Karon says that the clerk took
more and that his loss is considerably
greater than the â¢ amount already ac
counted for. ~ i-'.y'

The Forty-third District Club, under
Â¦whose auspices the opposition meeting
â¢will be held this evening, was organized
by the Grand Hotel committee during the
last campaign. It has been holding
monthly meetings , since then and has
never cone out of existence. The club is
anxious that the better element of the
party shall take an active part In tho
coming campaign and desires to encour
age i hem to associate themselves with
tbe clubs orjrsnized for campaign work.
It is certain that such action will be bene
ficial to the panv and save it from the
coiuaminatir.jr influence of Kelly and
Crimmins politics.
When the club discovered that Kelly
ur.i Crlmrains were stuffing the rolle with
-Lhe Tinman of voters brought from the
South of .Market street a protest was sent
to tha County Committee Eigned by
twenty-seven members. The protest
stated thai at least two hundred names
on the roll were fraudulent and requested
that a committee of ten be appointed to
purse the rolL L J. Truman, chairman of
the executive commitCÂ£Â£ of the club, wrote
a, communication to JL. J. Curry, member
Â©X the executive committee of the
County Committee in which a de
mand was mada fcr the rolL The com
munication was countersigned by Al
Bouvler, chairman, and J. C. Wilson, Eec
retary of the County Committee. Curry
agreed to produce the roll last Friday,
but Bent word on that day that he was in
Oakland and could not do so. The mem
bers of tha club saw In this a subterfuge
*r.d conseQuently decided to call a meet
ing on the same night as the Kelly-Crim
xnlns faction will meet, at California Hall,
said thus force tne issue. The call is signed
by 3. D. Hart, preside:*, and F. Tobel
xnann, secretary. Their action was hast
ened because tne Kelly-Crimmins people
refused to give up a copy of the roll as
the enrollment proceeded during each
night. The colonizers had been mar
shaied by Colonel Brady, Mike Klynn and
their cohorts and at least two voters who
Â¦were brought from Tehama street were
recognized as being ftiieu to the Fortv
third district.
The -wholesale stuffing of the roll In the
Forty-third Assembly District by the
Kelly-Crimmins aggregation is destined to
meet with the pronounced opposition of
honest Republican voters. A cail has been
issued lor a meeting of the Forty-third
Assembly District Republican Club for
this evening at Independent Red Men's
Hall, 510 Bush street, above Grant avenue.
The object of the meeting is for the pur
pose of discussing plans for securing to
the voters of the district a voice in the
selection of delegates to the state and
county conventions. The desperate efforts
xnace by the bosses to cs.pi.ure the district
by their tlmevrom methods of colonization
â¢will undoubtedly result in failure if the
County Committee will stand by the club
Â¦which Is endeavoring to Inject honesty of
purpose in Republican politics.
