the Chinese to helo us flsht our bpÂ«xÂ«Â«*.
China knows this well, and the proof
of her knowledge is in the thorough pains
which she is taking to thoroughly weed

boundaries before commencing the fight
of he-r life for final Independence and su

With an army of a million men and with
the blind obedience which her people
show for imperial edicts there can 1m no
ground for believing that she could not
assure the safe escape of every foreign
resident, were it her policy to do so.
Hut the foreigners within her territory
know too much that would b* to her dis
advantage in time of war, and the pirate's

ship used to carry British troops to South
Afrii-a.
"The Rcsecrans sailed on the afternoon
of June 2 with a full cargo. 223 soldiers
of the Seventh Infantry and a three
months" supply of 'subsistence stores. We
were making for Cape Nome and as all
details had been looked after with the
ufu:iI military exactness no one dreamed
cf ;he dreadful experience we were fated
to undergo in the ice fields of the far
north.
"On the morning of June 9 we a'rrived
in safity off Dutch Harbor. The voyage
so far had been &* exceptionally pleasant
that it was considered unnecessary to
dock there for information. -Then, too.
Â¦we had righted what was supposed to be
the Ft tamer Jennie returning from Nome
and this .Inspired every man of us with
the utmost confidence that Capo Nome
wan ours without any difficulty en
route. Every outlook being favorable we
pushed on. slowly, of course, to the north.
"The rcxt morning we. sighted the
whaler Wanderer, which seemed reassur
ing, hut I have since learned that she
was lost eocn of ter we met her.
"The course westward, near the Si
berian coast, would pi*obably have been
the most desirable, but as the west was
bloÂ«ke<i with Ice we had to pick our way
wherever we found openings, which hap
pened to be to the east In shallow TÂ»ater.
New and then we saw an iceberg, but
paid little attention to JU ,A little later,
however; large quantities of ice , became
visible* on every side.,'
"On the following morning, June 11,
the Rosecrans cast anchor off the mouth
of the Yukon In forty-two feet of water
and proceeded to deliberate.- A â¢heavy fog
Ijad settled so dense that nothing could
be done but to await Us clearing. -"The

arc not necessarily successful Bailors, to
say nothing of builders. The force of thÂ«
sale made it almost impossible to make
rapid progress in constructing the rafts.
The work had to be begun on the main
deck, tying the heavier timbers together
with strong: rope; then the rafts had to be
lowered and lighter boards lashed on.
The timbers had to be brought out of the
hold one at a time, for tho wind would
carry them away like so many pieces of
paper. In fact, a man could not stand on
the deck without being blown off bodily.
As each man had but one hand free to
work with, he was certainly laboring at
great disadvantages. The sea was choppy
and when we came to lower the rafts to
complete them we found ourselves in a
greater dilemma than ever. The rafts
were tossed about, but the men clung to
them and worked bravely. Several of the
soldiers had the misfortune to be. knocked
overboard when a block of Ice crashed
against the raft they were Working on.
The raft was lost, but the workers began
on another soon after they were rescued
from the cold water. N It was a matter of
life and death, and- they had no time to
think of comiart until they were sure of
ter resting until 4 n. m. of the 13th tho
Rosecrans began her struggle forward,
plowing through almost solid fields cf ice.
These blocks of ice are very deceptive,
being invariably twenty to thirty feet un
der the surface cf t.-e sea. and It iÂ» need
less to add navigation under such circum
stances is extremely hazardous.
"While struggling along we met the
Charles Nelson. Both saluted and passed
on. About a, o'clock the next morning, the
14th. the first crash came. The Rosecrans
was frolng ahead at a good speed and ap
parently in an open sea. when suddenly
there came a tremendous shock. Every
body on board was startled. Something
dreadful had happened. She listed to one
sid<*. We lost no time In learning the
worst and trying to render all the assist
ance possible, but things looked pretty
dark. In a few moments it was discover
ed that our transport was fast on the
bottom In fourteen and a half feet of wa
ter. Now she draws twenty-two feet, and
as we had grounded at high tide there
was no hope in the prospect of a rising
tide. She therefore hoisted signals of dis
tress. The Charles Nelson responded and
came alongside six hours, later. As the
Charles Nelson drew thirteen feet of wa
ter relief seemed imminent. Tour large
cables were pasted to the Rosecrans, but
they snapped like so many threads. The
Bltuatlon became serious, then hopeless.
A terrific gale came up, but the. Nelson
struggled bravely to assist us until the
tide receded, making It necessary for her
to leave us in order to avoid sharing a
similar fate. The Nelson therefore re
turned to Dutch Harbor, while we watch
ed for another response to our signal of
distress.
"It came late in the afternoon. The
Valencia answered us, but having &
draught of 22 feet could not approach us
any nearer than a mile distant, and even
then narrowly escaped a similar fate to
ours, which rendered her crew fearful and
caused them to back out of reach of dan
ger, and as they could be of no assistance
they were compelled to leave us.
"The Rosccrans was In the meantime
nettling deeper and deeper in the heavy
black clay, while large walls of Ice struck
against her side with such force that ev
ery one threatened to break her to pieces.
It seemed hopeless to try, to save her
now. How long she could hold out no
one dared to guess. In fact, we did not
take time to speculate.
"Orders were, given to lower lifeboats
and construct rafts. Fortunately there
was a cargo of lumber * aboard, from
which some of us proceeded to build rafts
with* all possible haste.
"The construction of rafts under ' cir
cumstances like these . was no easy mat.

Here house. keepers cannot get a

Dr. Sarah Wise of 150* California street
has solved the girl question for herself by
getting one from the land of superfluous!
girls across the ocean.
Little lai Ho .never knew her parent",
and docs not know where she. was born.
She must have been sold as an infant in
China for the very insignificant sum that
girl Infants bring then*. Up to the age of
10 years she .was a little slavey maid' in
Canton, doing the best that a little girl
of 10 years could do, looking steadily for
ward to a life of hopeless slavery.
A wealthy Chinaman from California
.who had washed sacks and sacks of gold
dust out of the snowy creeks of the Sier
ras went over to China and bought up a
'cargo of pretty, intelligent girls. Before
he got them* across here a plan was laid
by the missionary people to rescue them
on their arrival. There was a hard fight
In the courts and a harder one stUl to pre
vent the girls from being recaptured, for
they had been sold to Chinese parties be
fore they arrived here.' and the purchasers
naturally considered that they were being
[robbed of their rightful property.
was In the mission she was undoubtedly
as eager to escape as were her highbinder
owners to recapture her.
But the patient kindness^ of the good
ladies of the mission at last* won her
simple littlÂ« heart, and the villains no
longer pursued her.
After going through more adventures
than the heroine of an Arabian Night's
story, she was at last ready to be trusted
to the freedom of our civilization. __ .
In the meantime Dr. Wise had been going
through all of the well-known tribulations,
of those who require household help. She
had besieged tho employment offices and
them had been a daily coming and Rolnir

honest to take some memento of the lady

Owlneto different reasons â¢ it was not
convenient for her to have 'a' ChineseÂ«or
Japanese man In the house, and it ap
peared as though she must either give up
her noble profession and devoto herself
to her own housework -or else pive up
housekeeping. Â¦ 1
It was just at this point that the two
difficulties-came together which madethe
opportunity.! Tal Ho was growing too old
to stay at tho' mission any longer, for she

There ?re no women In the world more
domestic by nature than the Chinese. Chi-,
npsf! Kirls do not flirt: they do not know
how. Shopping has littledelight for them,
as their clothes arc plain and their trou
sers are all cut alike.
Tal Ho commanded the Fame salary as
an American girl has for the" same work,
hut .with the difference that instead" of
feeling herself down-trodden or oppressed
she enjoys the work and is very happy..
While our cookery is the base of our
civilization, it seems as though the art is
the most despised of any which is prac
ticed. A cook is without honor in this
Country, In China It is different*
There wealthy merchants. -bankers and
capitalists are prouder of being known as
good cooks than as members of their pro
tceslonf. It is almost the highest art In
Chinaâ higher, perhaps, in general esteem ,
than literature: and if one could know
the rank and standing of many of the.
Chinese cooks in this country one would
be astonished. .
The Chinese cook in establishing his su
periority to the people of the literati clas<j
points with pride to his own well-rounded,
well-modeled frame, and then to the thin,
lank, self-shown failure of the physical
form of the literati.
So Tal Ho is proud of her work rather
than ashamed, for she has the sense to
know that as the Christian home is the
unit of our civilization, so. the cook of that
home Is the keystone of its arch, and
there can be no happy home without good
cookery..

as follows:
"I ' have never seen anything to equal

who, stripped to the waist and led by the

the best in effect for all carnations â re

simply that It is more becoming. Try and
you will see. Just as some girls look bet

flowers have their individual styles of

A big flat basket is the best thing for
sweet peas. Don't choose a gaudy bas

The use of baskets in flower arrange
ment Is worth considering. They are to
be had in such a variety of shapes that
they are good for any flowers. The tall
ones make an excellent cover for a vase
when it is to stand on the floor. The
basket is surer-footed than any vase, and
its use may avoid much damage. Baskets
are used year in and year out for hanging
decorations because of their strength and
lightness. The preparation of a hanging

There are no end -of fads and fashions
In the arrangement of flowersâ enough to
drive you quite distracted if you try to
learn them all. But at the bottom of the
whole matter lies the law of naturalness
and simplicity. If you keep close to this
you ran never be Tar out of tho way in
producing an artistic result.
Glass is pronounced to bo the ideal sub
stance for a flower vase. 'lost of tne
beautiful porcelain vases that arc often
used for flowers were never meant for
them.- Their shapes have developed, per
haps, from ancient water Jugs and sim
ilar useful articles. They are unsuited to
the uses of flowers. The commonest qual-
Ity'of glass, if correct in shape, makes, a
better flower holder than many a fifty

Any. other color in glass Is good, pro

is that aierns show through, and stems

that? Don't treat them as if^they were

"Many combinations of colors in flowers,

The uses of striped flowers will always

A book v.-hi.-h is of particularly timely
interest now that so much of American
energy and wealth is being devoted to
expansion in far-off islands, is "The Con
quest of Arid America." a work giving in
a brief space a comprehensive account of
the expansion wr m:'.y accomplish in the
United State? itself by extending and de
vtJopins the irrigation of the waterless
lands lyinp MÂ»wn the Mississippi and
the Pacific Ocean, which the author de
scribes as "the better half of the United
States."
The materials for the book were Eath^
tre<3 by ten years of life work ami study
In various parts of the west, and the
chapters deal with the Mormon common
Â¦wealth: the Greeley colony of Colorado;
the evolution of Southern California: the
revolution of. the plain*; the truth about
California; the new day in Colorado:
pleasant land of Utah: th<Â» crude strenjtth
of. ldah<i; arid Washington and Orejron:
the potential greatness of Nevada; Wy
oming, lawgiver of the arid region; the
prosperity of Montana; the awakening of
New Mexico! the budding civilization of
Arizona. There are other chapters deAl
icg with subjects allied to irrigation prob
lems, r-uch as: The surplus people; why
the people do not go with the land; col
Â©aixatlon with co-operative capital; col
Â«Â¦>Â£>Â¦ plans and institutions; the adminis
tration of co-operative settlements; ad
justing eld ideals to new conditions; and,
looking forward to the greater republic
Tbe author points out and makes clear
tis proposition that the true opportun
ity of the American people lies not In the
tropic islands of the Pacific and the
Caribbean, but In the vast unsettled re
gloss of their own country- Tnere is
room, as he says, for 100,000.000 of people
In the States and Territories between
the Missouri River and the Pacific Ocean.
This arid region Is the better half of the
continent. It is tlie nation's sanitarium
and tbe nation's treasure house. The
States and Territories that compose It
"ha.ve more water power than New Eng
land; more coal, iron and oil than Penn
sylvania, larger and better forests than
Maine and Michigan, and produce better
â¢wheat ax.d corn than Illinois and Indiana.
The lime is rapidly -Â»oming when they
Â¦w-ill produce more and better supar than
Louisiana and will revolutionize the tan
ning industry by supplanting oak and
hemlock bark with canalgre. With beef.
mutton, wool and hides they already feed'
and clothe the East- They have finer har
b&rs than Boston and New York and a
sea coast that faces a greater foreign
world."
It is a wonderful story the author tell*,
but fcc has exaggerated nothing in de
pleting what has been achieved upon thv
arid lands of the West by irrigation. To
supply that irrigation and at the same
time to conserve the waters'and* protect
tho forests of the vast region, is now, the
most important work that confronts the
ration. The little book under review win
go far toward enlightening the people of
the East upon the subject, and ought to
bare a wide circulation. ("The Conquest

A REALLY excellent work Is that on
â¢ The United States Naval Acad
emy," by Park Benjamin. Annap
olis, class of 1S67. It gives not
caly a complete history of naval acad
emy life, but *s so full of bright in
cident and anecdote that it makes good
reading outside of its value as a book of
reference. Some of the illustrations are
<hown on tfcis page, but really a small
number corr!Farr"d with the numerous
mars, plans and photographs printed in
the volume HFoIf. Thirty years ago there
was published by the same author an
amusing book of sketches showing life
at the L"i,iiod FiatÂ»s Naval Academy,
under the title "Shaking's Etchings." A
very clever work it was, too. written in
a light and catchy way. Tho present work
shows the sane pleasant style, but. of
course, deals with the subject much more
F<->riÂ«u*ly and comprehensively. It is s;n
excellent :iair::tive of naval cadet life
from the earliest cays of the midshipmen
cf the revolution down to the present.
Mr. Benjamin gives us an interesting
j-ic^re <>f the Rtefors of th*> war of 1*12;
aisuan account of the first attempts to
tstfblish a national naval school. His
chapter* upon the cadets of the old school
cs contr.isucd with tho moil and methods
of to-day are quite dr-lisrhtful-the mid
shipmen who had a growing taste for the
dutllo anu an exmnu- slowness of -iÂ»ro
ixsoiion. He gives a .short history of the
founding of the Naval School at Annapolis
through the diplomatic skill of George
Bancroft^ Secretary of the Navy, without
troubling aÂ»reluctant Congress for money:
wherein he recalls the buildings and
f;rounUs as they originally were, and the
lifÂ» of tht.' Bddxhlpmen who first went
there. Then is reached the period when
it was necersary to appeal tp Congress for
Yx'.v and the appeal was granted through
the ability again of George Bancroft, re
*u!tinfi in the disappearance of the Naval
School to give place to the United States
Naval Academy. We are given a chance
to examine the merit role of Midshipman
George Dewey and also to know the men
who have raa<!e the naval school what it
is to-day and have added luster to Uncle
Sams record on the high seas.

this new edition of an ever-popular boolc

the fact thp.t the Illustrations are distinct

of Miss Florence Lunriborg, a California
girl, who has been studying for several
years at the Wh!?tlcr Academy In Paris,
and at other eoiially celebrated studios in
Franc? and Italy. For the past three
years she has ilevoted her attention al
most exclusively to the Rubaiyat with tho
desire to ina&e her Illustrations a stu
dent's elucidation of the text, rather than
a mere seri.-s of pleasing decorations ac
companying it.
The popularity of the Rubaiyat mad? it
necessary ultimately for illustrations to
accompany the text. With the exception
of tho?p of Klihu Vedder these Illustra
tions have heretofore becn"monÂ» decora
tive than thoughtful, more specimens of
artistic designing than elucidations of an
almost unfathomable philosophy.

A Woman's Paris
A convenient book fcr those who have
the. opnortunitV of visiting Paris, eithe'r
during the exposition or some time later,
is ore entitled "A Woman's Paris â A
Handbook of Everyday Living In
the French Capita!." The book Is
not designed for the rich nor for
the traveler. but rather for the
American woman of, average .me am
who desires to reside for a while,
in the French capital, whether for sight
seeing or for study. As fts till el Implies;
if is a, v.ork devoted to actual living in
Paris and has many chapters on' those
lines- which will appeal most strongly to
the heart feminine. In view of the exposi
tion special chapters relating to it hnve
been adrieJ. but while valuable to the
visitor rfhose sole purpose it is to see the
fair, the intentiju nf the book is 'mainly- it would seem that they feel perfectly
capable of ruling three men. but ten men
is a different proposition, and they hesi
tate. It is 3trange that they do not know
,that an empire Is simply a village writ
large. .Wherever there are inhabited
houses ono will find thieves: this necessi
tates police appointments for the protec- .
tlon of property rights. It seems simple
to substitute in tho stead of the village
police an army of policemen, with ap
pointed leaders. Of course, with the more
numerous body the rules and discipline
must be stricter and sterner In adminis
tration. When there are civil troubles In
!a village, such as quarrels and lawsuits,
the elders decide the cases and punish th
' offenders according to the established
laws. In the same way countries must
have Judges and lawyers, and they most
Ve very numerous, for the people are
many. Time and experience lead to tho
establishment of a regular code of laws
and punishments, and those who specially
study these laws administer them, and
offenders are punished In the same way,
when -they willfully offend, as are the
school children at' the hands of the village
school teacher. The empire must look
after the education of her sons, and she
establishes the higher, middle and lower
grades of schools for the development of
her young. talent, which is to offer the
material from which later rulers are to be
selected to govern and administer the es
tablished laws. In this, or course. thÂ»
nation by tnemselves? They are brothers.
They should not quarrel. They should
form a great coalition. At present they
but eat their own flesh. Â¦ Â»
"Of all the nations of the world America .
is the most powerful. She is firm, stern
and prosperous, for her people are as one,
and they are bound by ties of every kind,
but all of their own making.
â¢ "It is only when a country is so united
that it can have strength. Size, wealth
and population are but sources of weak
ness to tempt the pillager if the people
lack the cement of patriotic devotion.
' "Where is the enthusiasm of my peo
ple?" -^'i
"Their Emperor fs dethroned, and licen
tious mandarins quarrel for his seat and
usurp his power. Tet my brothers sleep.
"The founding of a company and the -
founding of an empire are practically the
same thing. In the founding of a public
company the mere rushing together of
men will not suffice. Unity of aim and
honesty of purpose must be the soul of
It. The eternal principles of law
and order ,inust be the binding
element and the foundation of an em
>.plre. In all defensive alliances of vil
lages, there 'must be administrators se
lected and . heads - appointed. Directors,
elders and constables are necessary. Just
so a country ha? its parliaments, its gen
erals and Its ministry. In the government
of a village there-must be those who rep-
I resent the law, the police control, thoso
who keep tho public account?, those who
teach the young, and the gentry who ex
amine into and direct the whole. The
same lines are followed out in the gov
ernment of a great empire. There must
be civil cfflcei e. a board o* revenue, a'
board of WAT and boards of punishments.
When America was mads Into a repub
lic th? people met and elected a ruler.
Thus it was exemplified that the estab
lishment of a council for a village and
the creation of a ministry for an empire
wore essentially the same. The only differ
ence Is that of size, one was small and
the other large. The empire has a wider
area to be controlled and the people are
more numerous. Accordingly its rules
and regulations must be more firm and
stern. While the needs of village coun
cils do not frighten the peopie and. they
do not hesitate, yet they shrink from
attempting to run a great country along
the same lines. :Â»

Impressed me doÂ« not think of him
as a Chinaman, but rather as a col
lege president, or a statesman <if any na
tionality you choose. Dress him in con
ventional costume and he would pass for
a citizen of any country.
He has the broad forehead, wide chin
and largo eyes that would make him a
success as a soldier, student, capitalist,
merchant or statesman.
lie is earnest, and above all things, he
Is honest. He docs not tell you st\ nor
does any one elite. It is a word which
no one would think of applying to him.
It goes without paying.
The Chinese are usually so mercenary,
Belf-centered and careless of what poes
on about thorn, that again and again
while ho was talking to me I could not
believe that he was a Chinaman.
I met him jus=t after the recent attack,
when he came so near losing his life
at the hand of the assassia whom the
Dowager had sent to Singapore. I men-
Uooed thii to him, congratulating him
upon his escape, as a sort of introduction
to our conversation.
Jie t=aid; "I do not care for myvelC. A
man dies only once, and in the eternity
which be lives a few decades sooner or
later make no difference. At the present
doc I have work to do. I live for that
and not for myself, and what is more,
I knew that I fhall live for it. I feel
that my life is safe until my work Is
done. It is in the hands of Providence.
Huge as my task may seem, I feel that
I shall accomplish it.
"My four hundred million brothers t*
pether. people the largest empire that the
world has ever soon. Never before, in
ancient times cr modern, was there a
people so numerous as ours. Never has
there been one apparently so weak.
"Our empire is becoming dir-membeivd.
We are slaves under foot, and powerless
as the f-ands of the pea, for much the
same reason. Kind the sands with cement
and you have a concrete monoMth which
defies the apfs, growing harde/ with the
centuries. IJind jhc Chinese with the
remer.t of awakened patriotism, and our
nation will become a rock invincible.
"A little thought will show that our Chl
pese p'a:i for themselves alone. They
place the welfare of the empire outside of
their thoughts and say, 'The cares vi
tfovrrnm^nt arc none of ours.'
"For that reason, though we have indi
vidually wealth, wisdom and courage, the
empire as a whole is poor, foolish and
cowardly, and whatever the strength of
the Individual, the decay of cations origi
nates from this personal attitude of mind.
'"No empire can represent its people un
less the leaders unite and stand firm. In
this way those^who are born in the king
dom will enjoy the blessings thereof, as
the Â«c:is eiijoy the ar.ees>tral home of
their fathers. ,/â¢ '
"The sarae rules apply In both esses. The
citizens of a rich cpuntry partake of the
prr>oi:ce,of Its wide acre?. Those of a poor
city will not possess land enough to stick
tin awl In. A man born in Burmah^or
Korea, places without inines and com
merce,'cannot produce wealth and enj<?y
it. But the Chinese have mines without
limit. They qould supply the mineral for
the earth. ThÂ«->y have an extensive and
profitable Internal commerce, and are
therefore in a position to obtain and en-
Joy the blessincs of life.
"Yet thc!r mines are useless to theri.
The people pass their lives In distress
ard r-ovcrty. while Kngland and France
have within their control the mines, rall
ways and steamers of other countries.
They invent and construct and so increase
their wealth.
"Take, again; the case of the individual.
If a man's family property is dissipated
his descendants must Buffer ' distress.
Having no regular income, they hire
themselves to others and becomte -slaves or
mentals', enjoying no rights and sharing
no property.
"When an empire is powerful lives and
property within its borders are safe. The
weakness of an cmnJro Is the danger of
every person and bit of property therein.
"When 1 try to awaken my people they
say: This Is no personal affair. of mine.
It cannot concern me. I will not take any
diction about It.' I have said to" their:
'Oh, my brothers, we cannot act thus.
"I will say this: As soon as I can male?
my people understand that their empire
belongs to them and not to their rulers.
"You ask of nie, what is the remedy?
"We ir.ust not be surprised when you
of the white raco fix your eyes upon ua
and laugh. While we are fighting each
other with both fists your people, will
come quietly and seize us all.
"When the bittern and the oysUr
wrangle the fisherman gets them both.
"The man who looks selfishly after hiniÂ«~
oeir, his family or clan, is not the Ideal
man. His eye is on his personal interests,
to the bread whole he is blind. Eager to
discuss his parents he knows not how to
consider the welfare of his fatherland. He
can combine in the interest of small mat
tors, but not on behalf of that of great
importance, yet it 5s. as though his hands
and feet had a quarrel.
"As It Is wit'.i the parts of China, so
with the members of her race in foreign
parts. Each but for himself.
"Sec China. A disunited mass of prov
inces, districts and villages. There Is rio

wuz a-sitting ther trying- to think what
'twas best to do. when Afcram come In.
'* 'Where's Cynt?' sÂ«Â«tys *>e, a-ki>sin c.\'

'On the front porch,' says I, 'a-talkln' to
the preacher.' 'So, he's come back." says
Abram grinnin'. "Well. 1 reckon Cynt'U
engage Mm fer to join us.*
" 'I reckon,' says I. Then Abram put
on Ms overalls and went out to do Ms
chores an' I begun to git supper. IVrect
ly Cynt she come out an' set the table.
She laughed an' talked moren I'd see 'er
fer months. I didn't know what to

still a minute. As soon as we got the
supper things done her an' Abram .Â«et
off to drive to town to a sociable. Ahram
&aid. I mind jest how Cynt looked in 'er
white muslin dress an' blue sashâ as
pretty as a picture. An' I mind Abram,
too, an' the happy look in Ms face when
he tol' me good-by. After they wuz gone
I set in the kitchen quite a spell a-consid
erin' what wus my duty to 'em both. By
and by I come to the conclusion I'd haf to
tell Abram. an' I made up my mind the
sooner 'twuz done the better fer all
parties, so I decided to do it jest as soon
ps they got back. I come dut on the
porch to wait Â»er "em an' think what I'd
say to Abram so's not to clean break Ms
heart. You see. I wuz puny juberoua
'bout the outcome â understandin" Abram's
nature so well.
"They wuzn't gone above two hours an*
a. half when I heerd "em drive into tho
barn gate. Abram, he stonned at tho
back gate and let Cynt out an' then druv
on to the barn. I heerd Cynt come in

after a bit I heerd Abram step in the

on tho street, not to open letters from
them.
Many books on theosophy have been
written by members of the Universal
Brotherhood â books "which- are an ac
knowledged guide so long as the author
remains faithful to Katherine A; Tingley.
But if the author leaves the society his
book is condemned as a "connecting link
with the dark forces*" and must no longer
be read by the faithful.
These instructions are as the will of a
Supreme Being. In temporal matters the
leader and official head is an autocrat;
in thinjjn spiritual no less than a god.
She holds her?elf absolute and infallible.
From her judgment there is no appeal.
And she considers it the duty of every
member of the society to report to her
any criticisms by other members.
At mention of her name in any meeting
all must rise and stand with bowed heads
for three minutes.
The rise of Katherine A. Tingley hap
pened in Chicago In February. 1898, when
the Theosophical Society of America held
a convention for the election of officers. .
A well-laid scheme, a committee report
rushed through.' a stampede by the Ting-
Icy followers and Universal Brotherhood
was proclaimed with Katnerlne A. Ting
ley as leader and official head and tha
Theosophical Society as a literary depart
ment of the new organization. The stroka
was a bold one, but it carried.
There was no mincing matters, as the
following articles of the new-made con
stitution show:
"There Â«hall be one supreme office In
which shall reside paramount authority
regarding all matters which concern the
welfare of the brotherhood.
"The title of the person filling this of
fice shall be 'leader' and 'official head.*
"The leader and official head of this
organization is Katherine A. Tingley.
"The person filling this office shall serve
for life or until her or'his resignation.
'The person rilling this office shall ap
point hor or his successor."
Continuing, the constitution provides
that the leader and official head shall
have sole power to appoint all officers and
agents, with power to remove any or all
of them at her discretion; to declare the
policy and direct the affairs of the broth
erhood; to cancel .or suspend the charter
of "any subordinate .lodge, and to suspend
or dissolve the membership of any person.
That the treasurer shajl receive and dis
burse all moneys as directed by a finance
committee, whose . acts are void j and of
no effect when disapproved by the leader
and official head; that the leader arid of
ficial head may call a congress at any
time and place : for' the consideration of
any matters connected with the welfare

The president of this society, J. .D. Buck
of Cincinnati, who was a. delegate to the
convention, recently wrote a stinging let
ter, to a doubting. Thomas, 1 * who could no
longer follow Mrs. Tingley. but who could
not see clearly-his^duty to himself. The'
letter read In part:
"If I did not make the mistake so many
â¢ made at Chicago >t was because I had
more ample opportunity of judging and
knowing what was -being done, and how.
false it was to every ; principle of the
osophy and deliberately unjust and un
â¢brotherly. I did not leave the" platform
at Chicago till this fact had been demon
strated. '
strange, circilar. domed, skeleton struc
ture may prompt a question which will
receive no answer. There are mysieries
in the city of Esotero.
Over yonder, where two square stacks
of stone .mark the gateway, is a corner
stone, which as yet supports only a flag
staff, from which floats by day the broth
erhood banner, while at its top by night
a beacon burns.
And this is all. except in the distance
two or three cheap frame housesâ the
Colony. Any hamlet might boast such
architecture as this.
The citizens of Esotero look askance
at the stranger. Indeed, they half mis
trust one another. Insincerity. deceit.
Buspicion are in the air. The life seems
false and artiMcial.
â¢ During the pleasure of the ruler of Eso
tero its citizens are not less than pris
oners. There are no chains nor bolts nor
bar?: but the citizens may not come or
go at will. They have no will. Kept in a
neutral state by loss of sleep, by awe and
fear and a sen?e of mystery, they bend to
the will of their whimsical ruler, who
commands and countermands in a breath.
All mails are censored; conversation is
restricted; books must be approved.
When the forty acres on Point Loma
were dedicated to mystery and education
in 1S97 it was thought best to have a care
taker on the place, who should prevent
desecration by unholy feet, who should
see that the purple and gold banner waved
by day and the beacon burned by night
from the cornerstone of the school for the
revival of lost mysteries. For this task
the Partridges were chosen. The doctor
is said to have given up a good practice
because cf alluring promises not only of
spiritual but material benefit. With his
wife and two children the man moved to
the new-born city of Esotero, full of faith
and rich with hope.
Once caught in the meshes of such a
system it is hard to escape. The mind,
soul and conscience, once bent to the will
of another, cannot be freed without an
effort. But why do they bend? Verily,
the world revels in humbuggery.
But faith will not stay a man's
stomach and hope will not buy food. At
this time Mrs. Tingley was crusading
around the world, paving the way for her
Universal Brotherhood scheme. Perhaps
she forgot the little garrison In the, lonely
city; perhaps she did not care. The man
and woman suffered in silence until at
last Cincinnati and an honest profession
seemed fairer than the city of Esotero
-and starvation, and the pair cast them
selves out of paradise.
Dupes of another sort cropped up at the
congress held last year at Point Loma.
To insure a large attendance at the con
gress the leader and official head an
nounced that those who did . not come
would lose two or three incarnationsâ a
backset few can afford in the race toward
perfection. Many believers made the trip
when they could ill afford it. .
During this congress many eyes were
opened to the truth.
Why were meetings held at all hours
of the night? Why were the people kept
going until they fairly slept on their feet?
Why the vague rumors of strange mys
teries ever about to occur but which never
did occur?
Weak minds become neutral under such
strain as this and subject to any Influ
ence.
To 1 esign or be dismissed means turn-
Ing from the White Lodge; the only al
ternative is the Black Lodge. Then it is
that the true spirit of the leader shows
itself. Prom the central office are sent
letters with charges against the disloyal
member. Ix>yal members are instructed
to declare 4 general boycott against these
"black magicians," not to speak to them
tcr.ts in wood. This is the City Beauti
ful where lotus buds dwell. Another
place of beautiful dreams and thoughts.
"Who enter here leave hope behind"
should be written above the gate that
marks the entrance to Esotero, says one
worldling who tried the soulful life and
found it but another name for starvation
iind hard work.
To appreciate a city of souls one must
remember that they do not care for beef
steaks, betr and icecream; that toii and
travail of the body is nothing to the soul,
und that the foor.er our mortal carcasses
are worn out and cast aside like dry
Â»-hucKs the more quickly and better the
Ixautilul mind comes forth like the milled
wheat.
Therefore think r.ot that Esotero is a
parden tilled with s-inuous rills and lux
uries for iiamjH-ring ilet;h. It is not that
kind of a tcv.n. It Is a city of dreams,
but all know that the most beautiful
dreams come to ! the chained slave, the
thirsting traveler on the deseVt or he who
starves in prison cell.
Then only uoes the mind acquire power
and ascendency to soar to those heights
Â¦whence it looks contemptuously on the
carnal tastes of earth and prepares itself
according to the Tingley recipe for battle
with the forces of the Black Magic that
threaten all about our little world hung
lonely in the gloom of the universal dark
ness in this Anno Domini MCM.
Lonely and beautiful is Loma; high on
a commanding site is the Homestead,
Â¦where all the citizens dwell in harmo
nious unity. Near the Homestead is the
City Beautiful, where lotus buds, the lit
tle children, are nursed to perfect blos
eom. On another hilltop is the Colony,
vhere homeless babes are being fitted for
m. broad and beautiful work in the world.
This is but a nucleus â a promise whose
glorious fulfillment makes words seem
poor. A temple for the revival of lost
mysteries, schools for highor learning, the
perfection of co-operation in all things â
these are a littie of what the future holds.
Point Loma was not chosen haphazard
as the site for this wondrous city. Here
is the esoteric center of the earth. Here,
perhaps on a level with the bottom of the
cccan, are buried ruins of an ancient tem
!j>le â a wealth of gold and rare treasure.
spot is hallowed by mysteries of oth
er ages.
Nor should such a spot be profaned by
â¢liuildings of a common order. They must
be as pure in design as the classic tem
ples erected to Grecian gods â all this, and
more. Are they not to serve a grander
purpose? Therefore no common mind
ehall bid thoin into being. It shall be
none other than the rnind of the city's
julcr.
Who is the ruk r of this city of Esotero^
Let all bow their heads at sound of the
name. It is the foundress-directress, the
leader and official head of the Universal
Brotherhoodâ Kathcrine A. Tingley.
Blink away all visions of fancy and see
how the city of Ksotero looks to -a world
lingâto one not of the elect. '
The site is magnificent, at th* very sum
mit of Point Loma. which stretches its
Froat length upon the .water, like a tired
monster. Thus far the worldling and the
ether r.jrre-e, and then-
Through massive wooden gateways one
passes â¢within the wire fence that bounds
the city of Esotero. A big, rambling,
frame summer hotel, once the Point
Loirta Hotel, is now the Homestead. Per
haps the worldling may bide here; more
likely not. The unknown stranger, is not
welcome in the city. He has ; ears and
eyes and a tongue for tales.
But if he may not stop, he has at least
eeen the city. Near the Homestead is a
row of queer, white objects, like sideshow

which to fall. Of the thousands of dollars
which have poured into the treasury of
trie brotherhood members of the society
declare there has never been a published
statement; and under the constitution the
brotherhood treasury is little different
from the private purse of the leader, so
absolute is her control of it.
In Los Angeles the .society has dwindled
from a membership of 1H to a possible
half dozen regular attendants, witn a lew
others who nave not yet resigned from
the lodge, but who t-*e no part in ita
work. ' Â¦'Â¦'. "â¢'.;-
The old members of the society every
where are sore over the present state of
things. ' To them theosophy is a. vital prin
ciple, and they teel as one might into
wnose house a powerful stranger comes,
assumt-s authority and bids the owner
serve him or be gone.
In an interview with F. O. Calkins, who
until about a year ago was president of.
the Los Angeles Lodge of the Universal
Brotherhood, be said that he did not wish,
to attack the organization, out in giving
his reasons for withdrawing he wished it
understood that he prefers to be ouuido
of a society which furnishes a woman to
do the thinking for its members and
which pretends to promulgate theosophy
when in reality it is doing the reverse.
AVrtfn Mr. Calkins made known his In
tention to resign he was treated to many
pages of advice. Among the letters was
one from Jerome A. Anderson, president,
of the San Francisco lodge, which read in ;
part as follows:
"You are making the mistake of your
life, but we have to learn by our mistakes,
and this step will be sure to bring you,
enough of sorrow to teach you the requi
site lesson of trust. You say you resign
because the organization 'a* it is now
managed is doing an injury to our deeply
beloved cause.' Look in the Uita- and read
what u says about 'the duty of another
being full of danger' and ask yourself it
it is really your duty to manage the or
ganization. . If not â and it certainly is not
â then -it docs not concern you how it is
managed. You must have more faith, my
brother. You ought not to consider
whether things are going right or not. or
if such a thought comes into your mind
repress it by the thought that the man
agement of affairs does not rest upon your
shoulders" ,
In the absence of the secretary general,
who was at that time in Europe with tha
leader, a member of the cabinet sought
to *point out to Mr. Calkins the error oC
his way. He wrote:
1 "I do not think you fully appreciate tha
strain there Is upon all the earnest mem
bers during these last few months of thÂ«
century. There is not a single weakness
in any one of us that is not a point of at
tack at this time. And frankly let ma
**y you have opened yourself to an on
slaught of the dark forces which you need
your best energies to repel. Let it not bo
said' that you drew back at the very
threshold of the new century."
These mysterious allusions to tha
"strain at the end of the century" and
"dark forces" are a part of a bugaboo
system by which the weak-minded aro
awed into faithfulness.
It is now but a few months since thÂ«
ruler of Esotero came to dwell in her do
main, bringing with her certain of her
"disciples and others who might be use
ful to her.
With her arrival activity began, for tha
city s only building was the Homestead. a

the story lisped by a tot of six years or
â¢o who spent some weeks there:
"We had our dolls, but couldn't plav

had to sit in our rooms. We didn't have
enough to eatâ only a little mush and a
tiny piece of corn bread for breakfast- *
slice and a half of dry bread and a eiass
of water, sometimes milk, for lunch: no
butter or sugar, except on Sunday; somo
vegetables for dinner, but no meat or des
eert.
"We an slept In an attic, divided into
rooms with blankets. The rats and mica
scared us awful. The lady was not kind
to us; she spanked some of the children
and made others go without their break
fast.
"We didn't have much at school but ex
ercises with our hands and feet. We had
some reading, writing and spelling. TfiÂ»
bigger ones had to help the little ones ani
didnt. learn much.
"We had to make our own beds. Arrf*
ourselves, comb our hair and do our ovp
washing and ironing. When I didn't knj'
how to do things I was told It was tliw
for me to learn. I didn't like being away

SUMMARY OF CHINESE NEWS
AS TOLD BY CALL DISPATCHES
TIENTSIN, Aug. 1; via Chefu, Aug. 3. â It is reported that the
Chinese have broken the canal bank, flooding the country
between Tientsin Â£nd Peking, Thirty thousand Boxers are
eight miles north of Tientsin and a battle is imminent.
SHANGHAI, Aug. 5. 5:25 a. m. â A report having been circulated here to the effect that Li
Hung Chang had committed suicide, a foreign official sent a messenger to his residence, but an
answer was refused..
REPORTED SUICIDE OF LI HUNG CHANG.
4J- : ONDON,Aug.'5' 3:50 a.m.â Last rright'sdispatches add'nothing to the general Informa-
I . tion concerning the progress of events in China. Although the agents of the cable company
at Tientsin on July 30 asserted that censorship of press dispatches had been abolished, it is
evident that correspondents nre not allowed to cable any account of the advance in the direction oi
Peking. According to- a dispatch from Shanghai, dated August 3, the principal opposition will
be met twenty'miles west of Tientsin," where it is stated the Chinese have erected extensive bar
riers arid obstructions have been placed in the river. Mines are said to have been located under
the railway, the line apparently being left intact. Sheng, the administrator of telegraphs and
railways, objected to the measures taken for the defense of the foreign se'ttlements, the enrollment
of volunteers and the presence of numerous warships, and asked the foreign Consuls to suspend
these measures. ' The" British Consul replied by pointing out that the measures were only intended
to strengthen the hands of the lawful Chinese authorities. '
A dispatch from St. Petersburg, dated August 4, says that General Mosievsky reports
from Chita that a part of General Orloff's forces attacked and drove back the Chinese regulars on
July 30., capturing. one gun and a number of flags and killing the Chinese commander and 200
men. The Russian loss was seven killed and twenty wounded.
Reports from _Berlin say that Prince Henry, in behalf of Emperor William, made the part
ing address, bidding good-by to the Fourth East Asian .Regiment, which sailed from Bremerhaven
in the direction of China to-day. â¢ â¢
â¢ - Â¦
A COMBINED force of Americans, British and Japanese, which at most liberal estimate
cannot exceed 20,000 men, has set out to relieve the imperiled foreigners in Peking. Ac
cording to Washington dispatches this is the sum and substance of the report from
General Chaffee,. which was received at the War Department on Friday and withheld from
publication. It may be recalled that a recent dispatch from Tientsin stated that an arrange
ment had been effected between the allied commanders that the main advance was to comprise
the American, British and Japanese forces, while the Russians, French and Germans were to
guard the base and line of communication.
China's determination to resist the advance upon Peking to the uttermost is shown by
â¢the flooding of. a section of the country in the direction of Peking. Meanwhile, not only
Â¦will the foreign envoys be- held- as hostages, but rk> communication. with their respective gov
ernments will be allowed them.. More than this, the Chinese Minister in London reiterates the
warning that the advance of the allied forces may precipitate a massacre.

DEBS SENDS FORMAL
LETTER , OF ACCEPTANCE
Thope are the views In a nutshell of
E. R. Fulkf-rson. United States Vice Con
eu\ at Nagasaki, Japan, who arrived in
This city yesterday la.fiernoon on the Pe
king. Consul Fulkerson has been obliged
to give up his official duties in Nagasaki
oxrJr.K to poor health. He has come back
to the United States for a needed rest
and with the hope that change of climate
will bonoflt him. He has been a resident
of Japan for eleven years and has been
connected with the legation there for the
j;ast three years.
Mr. Fulkcrson has a comprehensive un
derstanding of the situation In China and
he talked interestingly for ten minutes
with a Call representative at the Occiden
tal last evening.
"My reason lor regarding the situation
in China very grave," caia he," is because
the civilized nations have underrated
China as a possible fighting power. 'The
Chinese havÂ«Â» been diligently at work since
the Japan-^hina war increasing their.de
fense, purchasing arms and ammunition
and strengthening and- enlarging their
ermy. Tbe result Is that they are now In
a position to cope with any outside,
forces.
"The situation is a hard one to deal
with on the part of .the powers. Why?
Because the Occidental soldier has every
thing against himâ the climate, the food
and the waterâ and it 1b next to impossi
ble for a foreign army to penetrate into
the interior of China.
"Japan is the only power able to deal
VICE CONSUL E. R. FULKER
SON.
I REGARD the situation in China as
one of the most eeripus that civilized
nations have ever had to contend
with. War cannot be avoided between
that country and the foreign powers,
for blood has been spilled and property
destroyed Â«nd these acts of hostility must
b<> avengod."
. "I met the column when It arrived,"
said Dr. Smith, "and assisted in attending
the wounded men on their return. I
talked with them and am positive there
Is nothing in the story that the men who
were wounded were shot during the re
treat The admiral had barely enough
men to carry the wounded and look after
them, but there was no shooting of them.
He was very hard pressed and the city of
Tientsin was also In straits when I was
there." ,
The doclor left Tientsin on July 5, at
the time the women and children were
hurried out of the city. He says the story
that Seymour shot his wounded so as to
protect them from the fury of the Boxers
Is without foundation. He saw Seymour
upon his return and personally attended
a number of the wounded. None of the
men were killed by any members of the
American forces.
doctor â¢ says, his hospital bore the red
mark of the Boxers, which was a warning
that the hospital would be the next struc
ture for the incendiary. The building,
however, was not burned while Dr. Smith
was there.
The first shot, he says, was fired on June
17 from the Chinese fort toward the Gor
don Hall, which stood on the British ter
ritory. The charge struck. the building
but did little damage. It seemed as if the
Boxers would get possession of all the
territory occupied by the allied forces.
But by an exceptionally brilliant charge
led by 300 British bluejackets and closely
followed by 1&00 Russians the Boxers were
forced back, and the conditions then be
came entirely changed. The doctor says
that had the Chinese gone around by way
of the Manchu College it would have
been all up with the foreigners, as that
section was weakly fortified.
The big fire In the heart ol the city of
Tientsin, followed by the burning of a
large theater, was credited to the Boxers,
and the morning after the second Cre, the

the very midst of the fighting and tells
of a number of narrow escapes. He ar
rived on the steamer Peking yesterday
afternoon and will be in this city for
several days.
DR SMITH SAYS THE â¢
WOUNDED WERE NOT SHOT
"War cannot be avoided. Life has been
taken and property destroyed. The Jap
anese feel that the tlqal crisis has come
and must be fought out. The United
States has no business in China further
than to protect her people there. The
Peking relief column I consider far too
small to gain the ends sought, for the
reason that the Chinese can cut off the
base of supplies. The present Boxer
movement, I believe, â¢ is backed by the
Empress Dowager, If not by the entire
Chinese Government. I regard these con
flicting reports from, the capital as very
suspicious."
with the situation effectually. This is so
because she is near by and being an Ori
ental power her soldiers can live off the
products of China better than other for
eigners. But the Jealousy of the powers
will prevent Japan from taking the lead
and then again she is not able, financially,
to undertake a continued war with China-
Were she to do, so It would precipitate
war between Japan and Russia, as there
has been a hostile feeling between these
two latter countries since the close of
the Japan-China war.
"It is commonly believed that the cause
of the war is anti-missionary. . Make U
anti-foreign and you will strike the nail
on the head. True, the missionary has
located in the interior of China, where
he has been the object of attack and much
bitter resentment, but the real seat of thie
trouble is tbe fact that China has
awakened to a realization that she is
about to be partitioned by the powers.
Port Arthur has been gobbled up by Rus
sia; Weiheiwei has been taken by Great
Britain, followed by the taking of Kiao
chau by Germany. These three things
have aroused China thoroughly and have
convinced her that it is time to call a
halt.

In Mattole Valley there are about 50,000
acres of oil lands that have been spasmod
ically prospected with little success for
the past forty years, but no systematic
boring haa been done until lately. Now
there are ten or twelve, large companies
operating there and about ten wells are
being sunk. â¢ .
The fact that the authentic text of the
original message as received In Washing
ton on July 20 agrees literally with Consul
Fowler's report of the wording of the
original form written by Minister Conger
and bearing the file date of July 17 ap
pears to establish the genuineness of the
message and its date beyond doubt.
"CONGER." â¢
As it is known that the various lega
tioners and foreigners took shelter in the
British legation about June 17, the date of
Mr. Conger's telegram is fixed with ap
proximate certainty as July 17. , This
agrees with Consul Fowler's cabled state
ment that the original message as writ
ten on a regular telegraph form and
signed "Conger," Is supplemented by the
words, "E. H. Conger. July 17. , address
United States legation," written on the
same form but evidently not transmitted.
"For one month we have been besieged,"
which Intelligibly complete the sentence,
making the telegram read: "For one
month we have been besieged in the Brit
ish Legation under continued shot and
shell" from Chinese troops. Quick relief
can only prevent general massacre.
With the aid of the full text as .tele
graphed from Chefu by Consul Fowler
and already given to the press, the doubt
ful groups, which were distorted in tele
graphic transmission, have now been cor
rected and found to read:
The Department of State^ls In posses
sion of the original cipher text of the en

on July 20 and communicated by him to
Secretary Hay on the morning of that
day. It Is partly In the Chinese cipher
code and partly in ! that of the United

several groups not intelligible in either

words "In British legation" under contin

HONOLULU. July 27. -The dreadful

here to the depths. Yesterday Yang Wai

to the Government for personal protect

cuses the Bow Wong Wuf. or Chinese Re

doing.
The Consul and Vice Consul Goo Kim
have made purchases of weapons, organ
ized a guard at the Chinese legation and
secured the protection of the Honolulu po
lice. The officers are kept constantly at
the legation. ,
Yang Wai Pin made no official celebra
tion of the birthday of the Emperor oC
China this year, but the Bow Wongs got
up a celebration of their own. The Consul
gave as a reason for not holding the usual
celebration that he had been instructed
not to have any by Minister Wu at Wash
ington. It has been hi3 custom to hold Â»
large reception at the consulate.
German residents of Honolulu, tnrotizh
Consul J. F. Hackfeld, have offered 200
men for the Chinese war. the movement
having been started as soon as the news

Republican ratification In honor of the re

Convention, but all the plans were given
up when the news of the terrible Inter
national tragedy was heard. Most of the
Chinese here are Bow Wong*, and in view
of their large numbers It Is a fortunate
circumstance, as an equal number of Chi
nese of the Boxer variety might causa
serious trouble.
Great difficulty Is being encountered by
the United States postal authorities in

the pay is not large enough to tempt any

Attend the Services.
COBURG, Aug. 4.â Emperor William ar
rived here at 11:30 a. m. to attend the
funeral of the late Duke of Saxe-Coburg
and Gotha. He was given an ovation by
dense crowds awaiting him at aU points
along the road. V
As soon as the Emperor arrived at the
castle, the funeral cortege was immediate
ly formed. The Emperor walked in the
Iirst rank, between Duke Charles Edward
and the Prince Regent. The Prince of
Wales, between the Grand Duke of Hesse
and King Ferdinand of Roumania, fol
lowed. Then came the Duke of Connaught,
the Duke of York and an endless pro
cession of Princes and Dukes, representa
tives of German and foreign sovereigns
and courts, naval and military deputa
tions and officers of the ducal court. The
cortege entering St. Morltz's Church, took
up places In the chancel, which had been
convened into a veritable grove of palm
trees. The church was draped in black,
with hangings of embroidered ermine.
The "Bloom was relieved at Intervals by
green pine sprays and silver frieze, and
the creped pillars were entwined with
fresh garlands. From the organ loft a
black velvarium was suspended, with the
arras and initials of the dead Duke em
broidered upon It in silver. The wreath
sent by the. dead Duke's mother. Queen
Victoria, which, was placed at the head of
the coffin, was composed of scarlet geran
iums, white stocks and heliotrope in the
scheme of the national colors, and bore
the simple and pathetic inscription: "From
his sorrowing mother." At the foot of
the coffin lay an immense wreath of oak

Among the wreaths were displayed the
Duke's orders and .decorations.
At the close of the simple funeral cere
monies the troops fired a salute from the
castle square, after which the cortege
returned to the castle.

are seriously hampered by the Emperor's

that hot words have already passed be

Indications increase that Germany is

three other large steamers of the North
German Lloyd line have been chartered
for September, and that in the Cabinet an
order is Impending- for the formation of
a corps of 10,000 men. Opposition papers
criticize this because the Reichstag has

the Reichstag for the organization of a
colonial reserve army.

London continues to demand new hotels,

real American hotel in England. This will

Reports of unhappiness between the late

regarded as being the King's, and his rec

complete and lasting reconciliation.

Sir Thomas Lipton's party, which in

Depew and other Americans, returned to

fore proceeding to Cowes Sir Uhomas
said:
"There are many points of difference be
tween American and English yachting,
and only when one has spent several
weeks at Sandy Hook can he really appre
ciate them. England's insular position
has done much to make the sea a home to
many of our people and here is much
more attention paid to yachting than in
the United States, but undoubtedly Amer
icans are the best yachtsmen I know.
They are thorough in that as in all else,
and it Is due to appreciation of this that
my sole ambition in life now is to take
the America's cup. One thing seems
strange in view of American cleverness.
That they are sending here for captains
for seventy- footers does not seem right,
and I am u lable to explain why. holding
the blue ribbon of the sea so long, they
are sending to England for WringÂ©- and
other captains. What has become of all
the New England â¢ blood that made Hank
Haffs by the score? I should think New
York yachtsmen would promote Ameri
can sailors to the best positions by way
of encouragement. I .say this because of
my regard for American yachtsmen."
Lord Dunraven, who has been Invalided

England has had a coal question for a
generation, but Zo shillings for midsum

tended that the time has arrived to limit

â¢to make known the facts of his marriage.
Sitting down on the tiny sofa with hands
Joined in quite idyllic fashion they spoke
by turns. The King was dressed in white
Hannels and the future Queen in a black
silk skirt and charming bodice of pale
rose pink. Her jewels were all pearls.
His Majesty said: "Everybody wanted
me to marry. Every politician had some
good party, out 1 always refused, because
1 thought that in a question of this kind
a man should consult his own heart."
Then, looking at his bride elect: "My
sole desire is lhat she who is sitting- by
my side should be the partner of my
throne.
"I wanted some one who could under
stand me; who knew something of life;
who knew the country of which she would
be Queen; who would be ready to share
: with me all difficulties that are in store."
"Oh, yes. we shall have many difficul
ties," sighed the King's fiancee, looking
tenderly and bravely at the King with
her beautiful eyes.
"We shall overcome them," replied the
King, gripping her feverishly by the hand.
Then, turning toward the correspondent,
he added: "Believe me. the people are
not at all hostile to this marriage. On
the contrary, as soon as the surprise of
the moment was over they showed by
their attitude that my choice met their
secret wishes.
"I meditated long before taking the
step. It is said that I am ill. Well, no
doubt, I have slept badly these last few
nights, but there is reason for it. Do I
look ill?"
The correspondent declared that no
happy man could look better. His Maj
esty continued smilingly: "There is talk
about, difference In our ages. Well, you
have Only to look." which shows gallantry
upon the part of the King, though it also
reveals a little forgetfulness of his pre
vious remark about wanting to . marry
some one with experience of life. How
ever, Inconsistencies of sweethearts do not
count.
"It has been said," he went on. "that
she is more than forty and the mother of
several children. Please deny these ab
surd stories.
"The two young ladles who were seen
with her abroad are not her daughters,
but her sisters. Why should papers In
vent so many lies?"
The King's fiancee added: "I regret the
tone of certain French Journals, for I
really love France. I have long lived
there and never miss a year without
spending some months in Paris. I adore
Paris."
The King and his fiancee both express
ed the greatest disappointment at not be
ing able to visit the Exposition. They
would have to go about their own coun
trjvthey said, to prove how strongly peo
ple are attached to them.
His Majesty declared at the end of the
audience that there would be no more
vacillation or uncertainty resulting in
crises in internal affairs in his country,
and as regards its foreign policy he would
sedulously cultivate good relations with
all.
The King would not fix the date of the
marriage, because he could not be sure
when the throne, and regalia now en route
from the Paris Exposition would arrive.
In fact, his Majesty might paraphrase
Richard's cry: "A throne! A throne: My
kingdom for a throne I"

PARIS, Aug. 4.â To-day's inquiries' have
i cleared up the entire history of Francois
*Saison. the would-be assassin of the Shah
: Â«f Persia. It seems that Salson's army
: record was most exemplary. After the
'death of his father he resigned from the
â¢Â¦array and beg-an anew the roving life he
ttad previously followed.
During the inquiry Salson related that
â¢he once made an effort to assassinate the
former President of the French republic,
M. Casimir-Perier. lie hid in the shrufc
tÂ»er>- beside the road that Caflmir-Perier
was accustomed to take in his daily walks
and when the latter appeared, Salson
Â¦ pays, he attempted to shoot him with a
pistol. The weapon, however, missed tire
and no^one perceived his presence. Sal
bon's hatred of M. Casimir-Perier. he as
gerted. -was due to the latter's laws
'against anarchists.
He admitted that he pulled the tripper
of his pistol at the time of his attack upon
the Shah, but in this case again the
weapon misled tire. Salscn explained that
hoping to injure the explosion of the car
tridge he had filed tfce point of the ham
mer. This saved the Shah's life, as the
hammer undoubtedlv â¢was tiled too much
and the puHinjr of the triss^r only re
f ulted in making a small dent in the car
tridge.
Saison'5 laFt employer states that he
Â¦was a mode! workman, that he never
dipcusfed politics, but that one day he
astonished his companions by Fayinp*.
"Why should we work, thus enrich others

welcome was given A. E. Stevenson at
3:30 this afternoon. A big crowd gath

ried the : party of the Democratic Vice
Presidential candidate, who was returning
from Minnesota to prepare for the cam

across the street from the Stevenson
home, was the speaker's stand. J. G. Law
rence Weldon welcomed Mr. Stevenson
and eulogized his life and career in a
speech of twenty minutes. Mr. Stevenson
replied In part as follows:
All that genius in ages past has contributed
to the world's treasury of knowledgeâ to what
ever tends to human comfort and to the less
ening of human distress â dwindles in the pres
ence of- the "wondrous . achievements of the
nineteenth century.- The all-important Inquiry
now Is: -"What of the future?" "What of
the nlffht?!* "What are the perils that may lie
along the pathway of the .century upon which
we are soon to enter?" The future danger of
the republic is not from foreign . foe as during
the first two decades, nor along sectional lines
as at a 'later period of our . history, but with
the multiplication and' Increase of individual
fortunesâ thus emphasizing ? the distance that
separates their, possession from the toiling
millions; with the rapid. augmentation of ag
gregated, wealth: and the murmurings and un
rest that follow "as night the day," with the
Influx 'andÂ» growth 'of Â»n element' whose prin
ciple In action Is the destruction of the safe
guards of law and of constitutions; with the
rapid Increase - in every- field of endeavor of
appliances which mercilessly dispense with the
labor of human, hands and with population
pressing upon the means of subsistence, who
can doubt that from all these may Â¦ uprlng
dancers to society, to - the state, unknown to
the Brat century of our. history?
The safety ot the republic during the cen
tury upon which we are soon : to enter, will
rest not upon Its material wealth, Its physi-

SACRAMENTO. Aug. 4.-A meeting of
th,e directors of the California Hop Grow
ers' Association was held here to-day.
Secretary W. E. Lovdal read communi
cations from the hop-growing sections of
this State and Oregon, showing that the
growers heartily indorsed the objects of
the association, which is to decrease the
surplus. The hop-growers realize that
low prices are due to over-production and
that the only remedy is to -reduce the
output.
Reports from prominent growers of So
noma, Mendocino, Santa Cruz and Lake
counties were to the effect that the crop
was short from 25 to 50 'per cent in dif
ferent sections.
. A. A. Merkley, secretary of/the Sacra
mento Valley Hop-Growers' 'Association,
reported that the outlook In Sacramento,
Yolo and vicinity is for a falling off of at
least one-third. \ Henry Ottenheimer, a
hop dealer at Salem, Or., explained what
had been accomplished by the Hop Grow
ers' Association of Oregon, which . was
formed for the same purpose as the Cali
fornia organization. He said his firm was
so* well pleased with the brewer plan and
could see such luturo success for the hop
Industry that it will guarantee the grow
ers of Oregon 15 eei}ts per pound for all
sound hops srown In that State, provided
they will destroy or leave unharvested 25
per cent of thisir crops throughout. Mr.
Ottenheimer said that should the price of
hops go above that figure '.they will re
tain a 25 per cent commission on all above
the guaranteed price." The tirm Is pre
pared to give bonds suftlcient to protect
the grower and carry out the plans as
proposed. â¢ -
The directors, nfter considering the re
ports of the different sections of the State
in regard to crop ; prospects, concluded
that inasmuch as nature had reduced the
surplus to such an extent It would not
be necessary to carry out the plans of
the association for the coming season.
Consequently it was decided- to adjourn
until after harvesting season, at which
time "the work will be resumed and car
ried out to completion.

Loss Will Aggregate at

Dollars.

Firemen Use Dynamite to Check the
Spread of the Flames, but a
Change of Wind Endan
ger* Other Property.
ASHLAND, Wis., Aug. 4.â Fire to-day
destroyed 'a million dollars' worth of prop
erty in the lumber district of the city.
The flames were checked after three
hours' struggle, before they reached the
valuable sawmills and ore docks along the
water front. To-night the fire broke out
again and threatens further heavy loss.
At 1:30 p. m. fire broke out in the lum
ber yards of Barker & Stewart. It spread
rapidly to the Kristone Lumber Company
yards, and in a short time had destroyed
almost fifty million feet of lumber, in
cluding six tramways. Carried by a strong
wind, the fire brands started a blaze in
the lime, salt and cement dock, a quarter
of a mile away. The dock burned liks
powder. It was a quarter of a mile long
and was soon reduced to ruins together
with a warehouse containing thousands of
dollars' worth of merchandise and sevftral
miies of railroad track.
Four thousand pounds of dynamite wa*
brought to the scene and distributed all
around the edge of the fire zone. Piles
of lumber and scores of small buildings
were blown to atoms and the flames con
fined. Xone of the great sawmills had
been destroyed. The loss is easily a mil
lion dollars. Edward Hines said that the
loss of his firm alone was $800,000; fully
Insured.
At S o'clock this evening, the wind,
which had steadily favored the tire fight
ers, suddenly veered toward the city and
developed into a gale. The alarm was
sounded again and every available piece
of fire apparatus was brought into action,
but it appeared probable that the mill of
Barker & Stewart, Durfee's Mill, the Ash
land Iron and Steel Company's 'property
and the Ohio Coal Company's dock would
be destroyed. > ' . . %
At 9 o'clock, when it seemed as if the
whole city was in great danger, the wind
suddenly veered again toward the bay.
At 10 o'clock the iire was checked except
In one place, and there Is good prospect of
checking that. The flames have eaten to
within forty feet of a long double row of
lumber piles running directly to the Key-
Etone mill, and if the fire gets into this
the mill will go.
MILWAUKEE. Aug. 4.â A special to the
Rrntinel from Ashland pays: In the Bar
ker & Stewart yard four employes assist
ing in the dynamiting were pinioned be*
tween burning piles of lumber and were
seen to go down in the lire raging be
neath them. vÂ£^

Opinion of Richard Harding
Davis on the Situation
in South Africa.
Lord Algernon Lennox and Forty
Men Captured, but Released,
on Request of American .
Consul General.
Special Dispatch to The Call. .
NEW YORK. Aug. 4.â In the opinion of
Richard Harding Davis, the end of the
war in South Africa is still a long way
off, and the determined remnant of the
Boer army is strongly intrenched and able
to 'fight' on Indefinitely. Mr. Davis, who
was correspondent for The Call and He'r
ald In SQuth Africa, arrived with Mrs.
Davis on the American liner New York
to-day from Cherbourg. It is about two
months since the writer left the field, but
his belief that the Boers have an almost
unconquerable army has not been
changed by recent events in the Trans
vaal. __- !
Mr. and Mrs. .Davis, the latter leading
a fierce looking bulldog, were among the
first off the New York. It was while
waiting for his baggage to be inspected
that Mr. Davis was asked for his opinion
of the situation In the Transvaal. He j
said that he left the British army and j
joined the Boers because he was not al
lowed to send the truth about the cam- j
paiRn. "They cut my dispatches and !
twisted facts so. much that I decided to
leave." He raid: "When there was a!
Boer victory 1 was not allowed to send j
the story as it was. When the British be- i
came confused and fired on their men I I
was told I must not send that."
Of the present situation Mr. Davis said: !
"It is about as if New York State were i
tho seat of war and the British should ;
move north and take Albany, driving the
Boers ' up into the Adirondack region, j
They have provisions for two years, know ]
the rugged country thoroughly, are deter
mined to fight on to the end and at the !
same time the British line of communl- i
cation between New Vork and Albany is
being constantly cut by attacks from the |
side. 7 ' , :
LONDON. Aug. 4.â Lord Roberts tele- !
graphs to the War Office that General
Hunter reports that 334S men have surren
dered to him altogether. I
General Hunter also secured 1462 horses
and three guns.
Lord Roberts adds that General Ian
Hamilton continued his movement toward ,
Rustenburg and engaged the Boers in the
Magaliesburg range Thursday.
Lord Lennox Captured. j
Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes and Major
G. A. Williams were among the forty-one ;
British wounded. The Boers left two
dead and several badly wounded. Thurs
day night a train was derailed and at
tacked twenty miles south of Kroonstad.
four men being killed and three wounded.
Lord Algernon Lennox and forty men
were made prisoners, but were released
at the request of the American Consul
General, who was In the train. A^ Boer
force attacked General Knox near Kroon-
Ptad Wednesday, August 1. but was
routed and left five wagons and a lot of
cattle.
A dispatch from Pretoria, dated August
4. to a news agency here says: "It is re
ported that General Christian Dewet Is
dead from a shell wound. The report has
not been confirmed."
FOURIERSRURCl, Aug. 4.â There are
250fl Boer prisoners at General Hunter's
camp and 1000 prisoners and nine guns at
General Ian Hamilton's camp. There
were about 5000 in the Caledon Valley
originally, but .some refused to acquiesce
In General Prinsloo's surrender and.slip
ped away in the' night. These have now
sent in, asking for terms of sui render.
It will take pome days .to ascertain the
exact number. The Boers \vho excuse
themselves for not lighting say they are
in a hopeless position. The ravines were
choked with wagons, which were placed
in the most dangerous spots of the roads,
which were blocked for twenty miles.
Olivier Escapes.
LONDON, Aug. 4.â The War Office has
received a dlsnatch from Lord Roberts,
dated at Pretoria, August 4, which says:
"Commandant Olivier has managed to
escape to the hills In the vicinity of Beth
lehem with 1500 men. He has informed
General Bruce Hamilton that he does not
consider himself bound by General Prins
loo's offer of surrender, and that his force
intends to continue the war. He has
taken a position between Harrlsmlth and
the Newmarket road. Lieutenant Gen
eral Handle Is now following him.
"Prisoners captured by General Ian
Hamilton says that only soft-nosed bul
lets are now nerved out to the Boers,
hence the wounds of our men are very
serious. I am presenting this matter and
protesting to General Botha."
LOURENZO MARQUES. Aug. 4.â All of

ployes have bfu-n dismissed and replaced

X,os Angeles Charter Board Organize
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 4.-The new
Board of Freeholders recently elected
to draft a new city charter has
met and organized. General John R.
Mathews was made temporary chairman,
while N. P. Conrey temporary secre
tary. The board starts Into work next
Tuesday night. When noses were counted
at the opening of the meeting and thirteen
members were found to be present the su
perstitious freeholders began to look for
some sort of an antidote in the way of a
mascot, but were forced to proceed with
out one. The oath was administered to
all those present who had not previously
appeared before the City Clerk, but in or
der- to fully comply with the law it was
decided that the County Clerk must ad
minister the oath to the freeholders; also
that each of the latter must file with the
County Clerk an affidavit in order to com
ply, with the rule under the "purity of
elections" law.
NOBLE IS CONVICTED
OF EMBEZZLEMENT
Question Involved in the Case That
Is of Interest to Insurance
Companies.
Frank P. Noble, agent for the New York
Life Insurance Company, was convicted
of misdemeanor embezzlement by Judge
Conlan yesterday and sentenced to pay a
fine of $10, which was promptly forthcom
ing The Judge was lenient from the fact
that Noble had already been forty-seven
davs in the City Prison.
Noble had collected a premium of $54 45
and a verbal demand was made upon him
for it, but he refused to hand it over till
paid the commission. He was originally
charged with grand larceny, but as there
might be a question as to the commission
the charge' was reduced to misdemeanor.
For the defense it was argued that ac
cording to the agreement between the
company and defendant a demand in writ
ing had to .be made, which had not been
done.
The prosecution contended that a verbal
demand was sufficient, and It was the
duty of the defendant to turn In the pre
mium and then he would be paid his com
mission. Besides, the defendant had $103
which the company had advanced him.

Former Senator FTom West Virginia
Admits That Republicans Can
Meet Democrats on the
Trust Issue. '
r~*
Former United States Senator Charles
A. Faulkner of West Virginia, accompan
ied by his wife, arrived on the Oregon
express last night and is at the Palace.
Senator Faulkner, who is one of the stal
warts of the Democratic party, said last
evening in an interview granted to a Call
reporter that the silver question was
dead.
"Parties cannot make issues." he said;
"they are made by the force of events. 1 "
Imperialism will be the one issue, ac
cording to his belief. He frankly acknowl
edged that on the trust question the Re
publicans would be able to meet the Dem
ocrats half way.
The Senator has visited San Francisco
several times before and this time he per
suaded Mrs. Faulkner, who had not been
further west than Chicago, to make this
trip instead of a visit to the Paris Exposi
tion.
Their journey was made by way of the
Canadian Pacific, irom Montreal to Van
couver, thence to Seattle and then to
Portland. They will make an extended
visit here, with short trips to other parts
of the State.
Senator Faulkner last visited San Fran
cisco in 1831, when, with Congressman By
num of Indiana Â«nd Chauncey F. BlacK.
president of the National Association of
Democratic Clubs, he toured the States
of the Northwest in the interest of the
Democratic party. The distinguished trio
were sent out by the National Committee
to perfect the party organization particu
larly in Utah and the Dakotas. They vis
ited San Francisco and were received with
high honors by the Democracy of the
State.
"I always look forward to a visit to San
Francisco with pleasant anticipations."
said Senator Faulknerâ "more so than to
a visit to any other city of the country.
For one thing, there are a large number
of my old college friends from the law
school of the University of Virginia hereâ
"Billy" Foote, Judge Hoss, Judge Evans
and othersâ and I see old friends every
where.
"From what I learn, the expansion pol
icy of the administration la strongly sup
ported on the Pacific Coast. I was op
posed to the retention of the Philippines,
though I voted for the Paris treaty, which
in no way committed the United States
to an imperialistic policy. My chief ob
jection to keeping the Philippines -was
based on the fact that our national de
fense would be weakened. Any third or
fourth rate European power at war with
us could now capture Manila and Hono
lulu. We have so extended a- sea coast
that even with a much larger navy than
we have now it would be impossible for
us to use our warships to defend posses
sions so far away. Vet we would never
make peace while an enemy held those
possessions.
"A few Democrats in the North think
we have a fighting chance to carry Wash
ington. In the East we have anticipated
that the coast States would be strongly
Influenced in favor of the Republican
party by the imperialistic policy of the
administration.
"The Democratic National Committee
will make a very earnest fight this year.
It has more money at its command than
it had four years ago, and it will make It
very Interesting > for our friends of the
other side. Its hope of carrying Indiana
and possibly Illinois and Michigan Is
mounting higher.
"Imperialism will be the issue. The sil
ver question has pretty well dropped out
of the running. Parties cannot make is
sues. They are made by the force of
events. A party may put free coinage at
16 to 1 in its platform, but I doubt if any
speaker at the present time could enter
tain an audience for half an hour with a
discussion of the silver question.
"After imperialism the trust question
will be the great subject of discussion. It
has merit as a political issue, but I am
afraid our Republican friends will be able
to meet us halfway on It, especially
since the nomination of Roosevelt."
Senator Faulkner's term as Senator
from West Virginia expired a year ago
last March. Since that time he has been
practicing law in Washington. He was
sole counsel for W. A. Clark of Montana
in his fight for a scat In the Senate.
At a regular meeting of the Glen Park
Improvement Club nt Fairmount Hall
last night a committee composed of
Messrs. Heck. Gamier and Stader was
appointed to wait upon the City Engineer
and Southern Pacific Company in regard
to the opening of Arlington street to
Berkshire street and to request the Mar
ket street and the San Mateo Railway
companies to extend their lines through
the Almshouse tract.
The Single Tax Society will celebrate

Â«.f <"o!_mbus held here to-day the princi
pal address was delivered by Right Hev.
Jamea A. McFaul, IUshop of Trenton, on
Â¦ 1:.c Influence of Organization."
The Bishop discussed at some length
tbe duties of Catholics in political affairs
and urged thorn to organize to the end
that no American citizen should be dis
criminated a^ain^t merely because he is a
catholic or because he had favored Cath
olics where there was question of their
, rights as citizens.
iiisnop McKaul said he would not take
up the time of his hearers to enter fully
Into the grievances of Catholics, but he
asked: "can any man for a moment sup
r>ope that 'A we were united, not as the

obliged to listen tÂ« the heartrending tales
of uf-secration and pillage which have
come to us from the Philippines or that
several representative Catholics would not
have been selected to lnve*tigÂ»tÂ« and re
port upon affairs so intimately connected
with the welfare of the Catholic religion
in those countries over which the flag of
our country has recently beer; unfurled "
Continuing:, the IJishop said: "Among
recent ouiragi-s upon the Catholic con
science i.Â« tbe civil marriape law in Cuba.

riages arc legal. The effect of this de

And the religious service a mere ceremony
â rithout value in the eye of the civil law.
What possible necessity could there be
for a departure in Cuba from the law ex
isting in the I'nitinl States, which recog
nizes the validity of the religious cere
mony as regards civil effects? This is
eimply another example of the disregard
cf Catholic rights against which we
should most earnestly protest."
The speaker urged the justice of State
appropriations for Catholic Indian

HERE is six times as much good dra-
I" matlc material (and sixty times as
1 much poetry) in Dr. Doyle's "The
Â«'| Shadow of Quong Lung" (LJppincott)
'as there is In "The First' Born" and
"The Cat and the Cherub" rolled together.
As a study in the Iagoish traits of the
Chinese character Quong Lung himselfâ
the Yale graduate who angelically quotes
"God moves in a mysterious way" and
fiendishly electrocutes his enemiesâ has
never been surpassed, while the love story
of Moy Yen and Ho Chung is as pathetic
as is anything in "When Christmas Came
to Sandy Bar." Were not ChinesÂ© plays
at present very proper objects for public
detestation Dr. Doyle'u book would run a
good risk of being successfully dramat
ized. This fate is not now likely to over
take it, but in other ways it may and
should attain to widespread influence.
Nine-tenths of our Consuls who go to
China know nothing of the complex and
secretive nature of the Orientals by whom
they are constantly befooled. The Fed
eral Government should present each Con
sul with a copy of Dr. Doyle's book as it
does with a copy of the Consular regula
tions. The former Would prove more use
ful to tho appointee than does the latter.
Moreover, every would-be missionary to
China should be required to pass -an ex
amination on ethnic traits of the Chinese
as set forth in "The Shadow of Quong
Lung." If he can pass, this examination
and can then conscientiously swearâ no,
asseverateâ that he believes it possible to
Christianize Buch a race, he should be al
lowed to go to .Chinaâ and to his fate.
The- present trouble in Chnla Is largely
caused by the crass Ignorance of people
who rush in to exploit a mental and moral
territory where wise men fear to tread.
Dr. Doylo knows this Serbonlan bog well:
his psychological topography is correct
and is set forth in a manner at oneÂ© lit
erary and scientific. â¢ â¢ â¢ I don't won
der that Mr. Bierce gets angry when Pro
fessor Hudson talks about the future pos
sibilities of California literature. Behold!
Tho kingdom of literature Is with us to
day.
â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢
It is safe to predict glorious failures for
the dramatizations now bein^ made of
Borne popular novels. For ray part, I can
not find tho things that gx> to make up a
good playâ character, action, contrast,
variety, pathos, humor, suspense, climac
tic interestâ in more than two . of the
ephemeral romances that our women rave
over. (It is patent that women make up
by far the larger portion of the clientele
of the novel, as they do of the theater.)
These two are "To Have and to Hold"
and "Janice Meredith." The former af
fords material for a fine first act, where
the scene will (or should) be laid in a fair
meadow by the river James, whither come
the colonial gallants to { choose their
brides. The beautiful unknown lady will
bo o'er-roughly wooed by the tempersome
planter, who will thereupon be inconti
nently knocked down by the gallant Cap
tain Percy (Mr. Miller, I think it is to be);
a hasty wedding and the departure of the
strangely wedded pair for their lonely
home will close this act. Another good
act can be developed from the situation
in the cabin of the ship, where the hero's
life is saved by his wife's consenting to
give the villain a kiss. "He crushed her
to him," says Miss Johnstonâ that's not
bad for an old maid, and laugh as one may
1 â â , :
; 7~t XOTHER 6triking case of freight discrimina-
W \ tions against San Francisco is reported in our
â¢* * commercial columns Saturday. The Gov
ernment has been buying oats here for the Orient,
iand the business has been profitable to the port, but
it now appears that through the discriminations of the
railroads Chicago is to take the trade from us.- The
reports ehow that to the Government a rate of 60
cents per cental has been given from Chicago clear
through Â£0 Japanese or Chinese ports. As the or
dinary rate from Chicago to San Francisco on oats is
Â£S cents, there remains for the ocean transportation
only s cents, while San Francisco has to pay five
Â¦or six times that much.
By this discrimination Chicago is able at the pres
ent price of oats to land them at oriental ports at
?i 35 per cental, while San Francisco cannot
tupplythem at those points for less than $1 65. That
means of course that this city is barred out of that
important branch of the oriental trade, and the bar-
Xing out is done by railway discriminations which
artificially overcome the vast natural advantages we
possess from our geographical situation.
This new form of an evil against which our mer
chants have long protested should arouse renewed ef
forts on the part of the whole Pacific Coast to pro
vide some means of adequate and prompt redress for
tirch wrongs. It is to the Interstate Commerce Com
xnission of course that we matt look for relief. In that
commission there are two defects. First, it has not
the power to enforce its decisions with firmness and
directness, and, secondly, it has no representative of
the Pacific Coast among its members. To remedy
these defects the strength of the whole coast delega
tion should be now directed.
The commission has repeatedly asked Congress for
greater powers and has submitted ample reasons why
the request should be granted. Our Congressmen
thouJd from this time on cordially support that re
qucst. Moreover, the movement that has been started
to obtain. a representation for the coast on the board
should be kept moving. There is no vacancy just
r.ow, but the Pacific Coast men should be prepared
to act with energy as soon as the next vacanc3' takes
place. We cannot afford to sit still and permit our
commerce to be taken away from us by a gang of
railroad magnates who seem to regard the Pacific
Coast and California in particular as nothing more
then a province to be exploited in the interests of the
EcsL

FREIGHT RATE DISCRIMINATIONS.
ONE'S respect for the capacity of man for self
government is supported by the high example
of Mexico. General Diaz has just been
elected for a sixth terra in the Presidency, which will
i7!ake a continuous service of twenty-four years. The
republic is peaceful and prosperous. Indeed its in-.
clustrial progress has excelled that of any other coun
try in the world. A progressive but prudent spirit is
upon the people. They are attached to the ways of
peace, love their freedom and have learned the value
of law and order. All this they have done for them
selves. Maximilian came from the outside to offer
them a stable government, and they shot him. Since
then they have governed themselves. The population
is only 12,491,573, two-thirds of whom are illiterate.
They have not even been sent to our universities at
oar expense to learn the superiority of our civiliza
tion. They have just stayed at home and enjoyed
liberty, while developing their own country. Eighty
jjtz cent of them arc of mixed or mongrel blood.
Sixty-three languages are spoken among them and'
.35 per cent of them are of pure Indian blood. The
pure Spanish blood among them is in a very small
minority, and is supposed to be but little qualified
â¬or self-goverr.ment. Yet Mexico presents a condi
tion that commands the respect of the civilized world
end promises to be an illumination to the countries of
Central and South America which may study her
jsvays and be wise.
It is useful for our bumptious jingoes to study
3Icxico. Their faith that we are the only people fit
to govern themselves and are therefore qualified' to.
govern others would weaken as such study progresses.
SELF-GOVERNING MEXICO.
DRESS OF BRIGHT DRAB VEILING.
The engraving represents a princess
dress of fright drab veiling, opening in
front over a fourreau of white faille, the
upper part of which is in transverse flat
pleats. The tunic is edged with white
faille, embroidered in silk of various col
ors In the Russian style. On one side of
tho corsafe is a rosette of white mousse
line de sole.
The destruction of the Stratton primary law has
opened a vision of awful possibility. The Phelanites
now profess to see a.way in which to perpetuate their
influence upon the city.
There is some satisfaction apparently in being even
the tail of the* donkey if it is properly placed. The
Populists with becoming resignation have agreed to
accept second place to the Democrats in everything.
HE man who constructed the telegraph system over
which such fateful information has been filtering from
the Flowery Land was â is, rather, for he is still alive â
a Scandinavian engineeer named Hannibal Tietgen. He
is a powerful man, physically and intellectually, with a black
beard, a Cyrano nose and a great partiality for his own coun
trymen.
His most notable line-laying performances date back some
twenty years or so, and were by no means lacking in excite
ment. Although he was. of course, provided with the fullest
credentials from the Peking authorities, he took his life in his
hands when passing through a dense and superstitious popu
lation which both hated the "foreign devil" and looked with
suspicion upon his poles and wires. Nor were his passports and
imperial safe conduct a certain guard against the treachery
and cupidity of the local mandarins. Tietgen and his Scandi
navians were alone among the swarming millions of the yel
low empire.
Never did Hannibal Tietgen, however, find Mmself in a
tighter corner than when working across one of the northern
provinces. He had introduced himself, his passports and his
imperial safe conduct to the chief mandarin of the district,
and had been invited, with a wealth of polite phrases, to a
dinner party.
Tietgen accepted the invitation, through an interpreter, and
went. Notwithstanding the Interpreter, the Scandinavian en
gineer was perfectly conversant with the Chinese language,
though he had not. by one of the most fortunate of fortunate
chances, thought it necessary or prudent to say so.
During the dinner the interpreter was kept busy translat
ing more Celestial compliments into what might pass for Eng
lish. Nor would it have been possible to gather from the im

tion which was net being translated. The treacherous Celes-
tials, under his very nose and within sound of his own eÂ»r9
were arranging the details of a plan to assassinate- him! How
Tietgen kept fcis own countenance as impassive aa those around
him he does not know.
The dinner passed somehow, the other guests rose, excused
themselves and departed, to carry into operation the plot that
had been so nefariously concocted. Tietgen's host had under
taken the task of keeping him occupied for a sufficient time
to allow of this being done. Together traitor and victim sat
drinking tea. the servants had gone, and they were alone to
gether. Then it was that something happened which gravely
disturbed the great Celestial's cast-iron equanimity. The "for

and lo! a threatening brown barrel, with six loaded chambers
behind it. sprang to a level with the mandarin's breast. U
the same instant Tietgen's voice, speaking in excellent Chinese
requested him to Fit still and make no sound or he might cal

had no choice but to obey, and a moment later, having men

Mr. Greeley looked at the man with a

"So you feed your poat on Tribunes, do

"Yes, sir. I do!" blustered the stranger.
"All right my friend." said Mr. Greeley.

MAN WHO POSSESSED TRUE NERVE
How Hannibal Tietgen Escaped Assassination at the Hands
of the Chinese.
Taking all things into consideration it would seem
there is" a good chance to carry the State for Mc-
Kinley, and if the prosecution of Republican officials
by Democratic politicians, under. the charge of con
spiracy to bring about the assassination of Goebel
bring to light a few more perjured witnesses there
may be a wave of popular sentiment against the
wrong that will make the chance a certainty. .
It is to be noted that despite their claim that Goebel
fell a martyr to the cause of Democracy, the Demo
crats have this year promised to amend his infamous
election law. So strong, indeed, is the sentiment of
the people against the law that Senator Blackburn
is reported to have advised the Democratic conven
tion to request the Governor to call the Legislature
together to repeal it. The convention did not follow
the counsel, but it did pledge the party to so amend
the act "that the most hypercritical can find no excuse
for charging fraud or unfairness to our party in the
qonduct of the election. Until such amendments can
be enacted by the General Assembly, we declare that
the Republican party shall have representation upon
both the State and County Boards of Election Com
missioners." 5->5h
To that extent the Democrats are on the defensive.
They will not dare attempt another such outrage as
that which led to the murder of Goebel and came
near involving the State in civil war. The Republi
cans have that much of advantage and they appear
to have made good use of it in the nomination of
John W. Yerkes, who has long been one of the ablest
Republican leaders in the State and has a strong per
sonal following among independent voters. The Re
publican platform, of course, demands the repeal of
the Goebel law, and as that would be much better
than any Democratic tinkering in the way of amend
ment it ought to bring to the party a considerable
support from those Democrats who sincerely favor
honest, politics and a desire to rid their party and
their State from the last vestige of that shameless act.
OUT of the prosecution of Caleb Powers upon
a charge of complicity in the assassination of
Goebel the Democratic politicians of Ken
tucky have gained nothing. In fact, about the
most notable incident of the case thus far is
the committal of one of the witnesses for the
prosecution to jail for perjury. In that' we
have a confirmation of what The Call predicted at
the time the large reward was offered for evidence to
convict. The desire to obtain the reward or at least
a part of it has. been too strong for at least one un
scrupulous man, and he has sworn he saw a rifle in
the window of the office of the Secretary of State
at the time Goebel was killed, while as a matter of
fact he was at the time 150 miles from the capital,
as the defense has been able to prove.
What effect all this is to have upon the election it
is not possible at this time v to foresee. Under ordi
nary conditions the vote of Kentucky would be fairly
assured for the Republican ticket. The sound
money Democracy that would not vote for Bryan
even in the calamity times of 1896 would hardly vote
for him now that the McKinley administration has
brought so much prosperity to every section of the
Union. Moreover, the working of the Goebel law
has been of a nature to disappoint its supporters ;and
to offend the whole decent element of the State. The
only thing thereforÂ£ that is likely to injure the Re
publican party in the State -is the murder of Goebel
under such circumstances as to have caused a strong
reaction against the well nigh universal condemna
tion that was once pronounced upon him.
THE SITUATION IN KENTUCKY.
Such are some of the salient points of this elaborate
study. In some respects they wilt cause no little sur
prise. Why should Milwaukee be at the head of the
column in literature? Why should Boston give little
space to either literature or business? Why should
New Orleans in editorials? If there be any
psychological explanation of such things, it will take
an expert to find it out.
Louisville stands fir,st in business news, Buffalo first
in sporting news and in 'advertisements as a whole,
Cleveland first in foreign news, New Orleans first in
war new^ and editorials, and Milwaukee is first in the
amount.of space given to literature.
Philadelphia stands first in society news and last in
medical advertisements. Chicago stands second in
literature and nearly last in the amount of space given
to vice and crime. It also gets the credit of furnish
ing "the best average among its leading newspapers
of any great city in the United States." Baltimore
and Washington City have no other peculiarities than
that of ranking next to Boston at the bottom of the
list of business news. Pittsburg has the honor of
Btanding first in retail advertising and next to the last
in want advertisements. Of St. Louis and Cincinnati
it is said they are "the most notable centers of yellow
journalism in the country. They keep remarkably
close In the matter of percentages. Both stand high
in illustrations, medical advertisements and. news of
crime and vice, while they stand very low in letters,
editorials, literature and retail advertisements."
Some of the results of the investigation are curious.
San Francisco stands away above all other news cen
ters in the proportion of illustrations. It also stands
first in want advertisements, but is last in retail adver
tisements, being in these respects almost the exact
opposite of Pittsburg. New York has journals of all
descriptions, setting the pace in conservative and in
yellow journalism alike, but does not occupy the first
or the last place in any department. In the matter of
illustrations Boston comes next to San Francisco,
with St. Louis, Denver and New York in their order.
Whether that theory be true or not, the article fur
nishes a good deal of interesting information concern
ing American newspapers. For the purpose of mak
ing the studj', Mr. Wilcox obtained copies of 240 ouf
of the 250 newspapers cf the country having a circula
tion of more than 7500 a day. He classified their
contents as: News, illustrations, literature, opinion
and advertisements, and proceeded to note the pro
portion of each found in .the various papers. Then,
for the purpose of fuither investigation, he subdi
vided news into several departments, such as war,
foreign, political, business, sporting, society, crime
and vice and general news. Advertisements were also
subdivided and a study made of the comparative
amount of space taken in different cities by want ad
vertisements, medical advertisements-, retail advertise
ments, self-laudatory advertisements by the paper and
miscellaneous advertisements.
DELOS F. WILCOX contributes to Annals of
the American Academy an article on the Amer

can note the diverging courses of development in dif
ferent parts of the United States by a careful com
parison of the differences in their newspapers.

The Dramatization of Novels.
BY L, DU PONT SYLE,
Another difficulty is the nomination of Mr. Towne,
a Silver Republican, for Vice President. Mr. Towne
figures as a sort\of floating kidney in politics. The
party he belongs to would not nominate him. The
Democrats sat on him hard, and the Populists nomi
nated him. It is hard for Colonel Bryan to accept
the Democratic nomination and speak of Stevenson
and the honor of being on the ticket with him and
then lay his political hand on his political heart and
tell the Populists that the proudest act of his life is
accepting a nomination with Towne! In any but
fusion politics the situation would be embarrassing.
After these three ceremonies are* finished the coun
try will be notified that the campaign is open.
Colonel Bryan will probably take to the road and
girdle the country with oratory, prophecy and awful
predictions. The political hydra with three heads
will utter from its three mouths, and the people will
pray for rapid progress through the zodiac to No
vember, that "silence may come, like a poultice, to
heal the wounds of sound."
The same is true of the Silver Republican nomina
tion. It is so difficult to find a place where there arc
three members of the party that it may be necessary
to import enough to witness the ceremony and sign
the certificate. '
After it is over Colonel Bryan will sweep and gar
nish his mind for the Populist acceptance. The place
cf this ceremony has not yet been fixed. It must be
remembered that the peanut and pink lemonade privi
lege at these shows is of value, and it is a weighty
matter to decide upon what city to bestow it.
Chicago is too big, 'end Sunrise City, Kans., is too
little for it. Lincoln stubbornly votes against Bryan,
so he won't have it there, and at present the feast is
movable.
When he accommodates his acceptance to the
speeches he must make at the other two ceremonies,
diluting it to Populism and Silver Republicanism, one
can fancy Jo McDonald, MichaelC. Kerr, Hendricks
and English laying by their harps and their music
lesson to listen, and then return to picking celestial
catgut, with the remark that if that is Democracy
they must have belonged to some other party when
in the flesh.
He will shortly proceed to Indianapolis for the
Democratic wedding. It will be a great day for
Hoosier. Mayor Taggart will offer the freedom of
the city, the statue of George Rogers Clark will have
its ears pierced by the strident strains of "Dixie" and
"On the Wabash," and Bryan will deliver an oration
which White River will echo back from her atra
bilious shores. Hawkins, John P. Frenzel, John Wil
son, Sheerin and the other Gold Democrats will hunt
holes, and as for the Republicans, they may grin but
will have to bear it Â«
/*"** OLONEL BRYAN will soon be busy accepting
I nominations. It is his open season for accept-
ing. He has three to accept and will do it
separately. He will commit political trigamy; will, in
fact, publicly wed himself to three different parties,
the ceremonies to be close together in point of time
and the honeymoons to be concurrent and coter
minous. But few public men have enjoyed this fe
licity, but as it is all he will get out of the campaign
no one grudges it It is an economical proceeding,
since one outfit serves for all three ceremonies.
POLITICAL TRIGAMY.
The British have of course many reasons for de
siring to avoid further wars at this time. The burden
of empire is heavy upon them. In South Africa it has
brought a costly war, and in India a famine that ranks
among the most terrible in history- Wars and fam
ines cost money, and the taxpayers have to foot. the
bills. Moreover, amid the miseries in which they are
now involved the British can see others clearly ap
proaching. There are demands for a larger navy, and,
more portentous still, a movement to impose upon
the people a military system something like that of
Continental Europe. Added to all these burdens
another load in China would be too much. For the
present, therefore, the British lion is about as tame
a beast as ever was carried in a circus cage. He is
not so much of a hog as has been supposed. He
knows when he has enough.
Very different is the tone of the people now from
that of the empire-making years. The British are
tired. Even the jingoes have ceased to exult in war
and clamor for a wider empire. A recent dispatch
from London, in noting the curious turn in public
sentiment there, said; "In the midst of these doubts
and misgivings one remarkable development of Brit
ish opinion must be^oted. That section of the Lon
don press which, has hitherto been most closely as
sociated with rampant imperialism is now joining
what it is the fashion to call the 'Little England' sec
tion in the cry of 'Hands of! China.' Thus the St.
James' Gazette made its Tory readers rub their eyes
last night by calmly predicting and even welcoming
the disappearance^of England's political predominance
in China. England's commercial predominance, it
argues, depends upon one fact alone, that ''we have
goods to sell which others cannot produce of equal
quality or cannot sell at the same price. When that
ceases to be the case we shall be beaten in the mar
ket, but not till then, and the fate is one from" which
no politics can ever save us.' In the equally imperial
ist Daily Mail we read to-day: 'The partitioning
powers have raised the dragon. As the dragon is
mainly concerned with them, they may well be left
to see to it Whether or not China succeeds in wrest
ing her territory from their grasp is all one to us.' "
ONE of the significant features of the crisis that
has arisen out of the conflict between Europe
and China is the evident desire of Great Brit
ain to avoid it as far as possible. She has sent com
paratively few troops to the scene of action, and is
making no preparations to send more. She has made
no attempt to take the leadership of the allies, and
none to seize Chinese territory. On the contrary, she
has been eagerly seeking to obtain a general agree
ment of the powers not to partition China, and, fur
thermore/has been sufficiently self-sacrificing, not to
call it submissive, to permit the Russians to take con
trol of a railroad built by British capital."
x AIL. these things are so different from the usual
course of the British that they naturally give rise to
comment As a rule Great Britain has welcomed any
disturbances of the kind now going on in China with
a glad heart and a ready hand. She has known how
to make use of them for the purpose of extending her
empire, and many of her rich possessions have come
to her as a result of them. It has not been very long
ago since such a chance as that now given for land
grabbing in China would have been hailed a3 a
golden opportunity, and all classes of her people,
merchants, manufacturers and aristocrats, would have
united in upholding the Government in all that it did
to "extend civilization" and open new fields for trade.

Beginning with the current issue The
Saturday Wave opens a new era of de
velopment. This live Journal appears in
a handsome new dress with eight addi
tional pages of reading matter and with
Improved illustrations. .In connection
with this general strengthening, whicn.
makes It undoubtedly the best American
weekly Journal published outside the At
lantic centers, there has been a reduction'
ln price to 5 cents per copy to meet the
general cheapening of current periodicals.
Thus it becomes not only the best weekly
published on the coast, but the cheapest.
While- a special effort will be made to
represent the Pacific Slope and the Pa
cific region generally. The Wave will yet
present live matter upon all the current
events of the day. By a special arrange
ment with an Eastern firm, photographic
illustrations of interesting occurrences the
world over will be available each week. In
this respect. The Saturday .Wave will 'be
fully the equal of any weekly in , the
world. All the regular departments, have
been strengthened and new ones of great
general interest added.

"What Dreams May Come." by Gellett
Burgess; a series of storiettes from the

Assumes Charge of Them "With the
Approval of Public Works
Board.
The Board of Public Works has sent a
communication to Chairman Mark of the
Board of Education regarding the action
of the latter body in making repairs to
schoolhouses. In the communication Mark
is Informed that as the Board. of Super
visors ln allotting funds for the services
of the several departments- of the city
government did not place the money set
apart for repairs for school buildings un
der the charge of the Board of Works
and did place this money under the con
trol of the Board of Education, the for
mer board has no official concern with the
repairs.
Chairman Mark says the precise char
acter and urgency of the repairs were
best understood by his board, which as
sumed charge of the same with the ap
proval of the Board of Works. The Audi
tor says he will 6lgn the demands for re
pairs on this showing. i-;;^3*

St. Patrick's Picnic.
Arrangements for St. Patrick's pariah
picnic, to be held at Schuetzen Park Sep
tember 3, are beginning to assume definite
shape. Reports of the various commlt-
tees are very gratifying-, and from the
amount of labor expended great things are
expected. Mrs. Hughes and daughter have
established a record for obtaining eighty
three excellent prizes. Other members
hope to exceed this number.
Mixed in with the statistics in thp re
port of the Secretary and General Man
ager are some striking and valuable ut
terances. "It Is the Building Association's
mission to help men start in life by edu
cating them ln the small things which
make It up. When this is done the larger
affairs willbe easily taken care of. We
wish it understood that we do not believe
in the miser. lie is more of a detriment
to himself and the community in which
he lives than the spendthrift. Live within
your means. Strike the- happy medium
and you have sounded the true chord,
the echoes of which, will be pleasant mu
sic to all who come within its tones."
The gross, profits during the year
amounted to S139.S66 55. The net amount
turned into profits of the members for
the year amounted to $95,245 58. Dividends
were 5 per cent per annum on ordinary
deposits 6 per cent on term deposits,- 10
per cent to Class "F" stock. 12 per cent to
Class "A" Â¦ stock.' To Class "A" stock a 10
per cent dividend was added, but besides
that tiere was saved $4582 72, which will
make the actual profit to Class "I"- about
15 per cent per annum. Three insured
members died in the year. As stock im
mediately matures in such cases, there
was distributed $6000 ln cash to the three
The assets Include the following: Mort
gage loans. $1,425,618 43; loan ..association

real estate sold under contract, $9478 09:
Â«undrv advances -.secured by mortgages,
$59,07286. The total, is $1,705,687 53.
"These large accumulations," said the
General Manager and Secretary, "have
been built up by people in the ordinary
walks of life: people who have learned
that the only way to save is to save, and
that the road to â¢ success Is along the
lines of quick and. immediate action.
Golden opportunities are nothing to the
lazy man or woman. Such people are
rvever prepared for them, and should they
make a show of taking advantage of
them they always prove a failure; not
because it was not a splendid chance, but
their don't care methods have given them
an education wholly unfitting them from
grasping the practical side of life."
The agency department, which is com
posed of some of the best field men that
this or any other State affords, gave an
excellent. account of itself last year. The
following facts and llgures are taken
from the reports. There have been made
412 loans as against 3S4 for 1899. The gross
amount loaned on mortgages was $524,
111 43 and on shares of . the association
$104,375 98, making a grand total of $628,
4S7 41 loaned during the year.
The report of. the Secretary and General
Manager to the directors and stockhold
ers shows that the handling of the af
fairs of the association has been skillful
and judicious. At the end of June, 1S99,
the subscribed capital was $S,428,500, rep
resenting 84,255 shares In force. On June
30. 1900, the subscribed capital wds $10,
326.500, representing 103,265 shares in force.
The assets at the end of June, 1899, were
$1,321,845 14; at the end of June, 1900, $1,
705,07 53, making an increase for the year
of 29 per cent in assets and 22 per cent
in shares in force.
The annual reports of the President and
Secretary of the Continental Building and
Loan Association of San Francisco dem
onstrate a prosperous condition of affairs.
The assets Increased during the year from
$1,321,845 14 in 1S99 to J1.705.6S7 53 In 1900,
making a gain for the year of $383,842 39
as against $343,59S 70 increase in 1S99. The
earnings apportioned to Installment stock
increased from $133,367 49 in 1S99 to $159,
735 SO in 1900. In addition to this there is
a reserve fund of $41,648 73. In six years,
inclusive of the first half only of 1000,
there have been built 696 new homes for
the stockholders. The association has on
deposit with the California Title Insur
ance and Tru3t Company and Bank of
California, ln trust for all the members
and creditors, notes and mortgages to the
amount of $1,425,618 43.

Superintendent of Public Buildings I
Sarnett Reports on Bad Condi
tion of City Hall and Hall
of Justice.
/ Commissioners Maguire and Hanson of
-the Board. of Public Works, City Engineer
Grunsky, Supervisor McCarthy and Chief
Engineer Howard Holmes of the Harbor
Commissioners concluded their investiga
tions yesterday hi ; connection with the
proposed improvement on the city's prop
erty at the foot of Spear street. The re
sult of a conference on the subject will be
that the original intention of the Board j
of Public Works to construct a plank
roadway, at a cost of about $7000 will be
carried out. Supervisor McCarthy inter
posed some objection to the plan, as he
tavored a permanent wharf and stone
bulkhead, so that repairs would be re
duced to a minimum in the future. It was
demonstrated to McCarthy's satisfaction
that the large- expenditure entailed by
lilllng ln the bay along the shore would
be ill advised, as the permanent water
front line has not been yet determined.
It may ultimately be decided that the
alignment shall be about 200 feet to. the
west of the present survey. The State
will build a bulkhead in the near future,
and if the city should build a stone bulk
head In advance It would be of no use
whatever. Besides it will cost the city
over $12,000 to till Inside the bulkhead, and
the committee decided that it would be a
useless expenditure of money. The plank
roadway is expected to last ten years, and
in the meantime plans will be formulated
for a permanent roadway.
Superintendent of Buildings Barnett filed
a report with the board yesterday on the
operations of his department for six
months. Attention is called to the dilap
idated and filthy condition of the City
Hall. Every closet where dirt, ashes and
rubbish could be stored was tilled to over
flowing. Over three hundred cartloads
of refuse had been removed from the
building. The sub-basement was so filled
as to endanger the health of persons com
pelled to pass through it. The wood
work in all parts of the building was
hacked and broken and the plumbing was
badly out of repair. . The plastering in all
of the corridors and in many of the rooms
looked as if some person had deliberately
tried to remove It with a hatchet. The
matters had been remedied as far as it
was possible with the limited amount of
funds available for such purposes, the re
port concluded.
Superintendent Barnett also reported
that the Hall of Justice was in a filthy
condition for a new building. It will re
quire a large amount of money and con
siderable work to make it fit for occu
pancy. According to a report of Expert
Williams there is about 410,000 yet remain
ing in the fund, and after other claims are
adjusted the balance will be utilized to
perform the necessary work of cleaning?
the building. Â¦*
City Officials Decide That
the Improvement Is
Advisable.

Experiment has disclosed the fact that
California could produce a quality of the
luscious vegetable that could not be
equaled In the Eastern gardens, and it
was soon found that there was a good
demand for the California product. The
enterprise was therefore started on a
large scale and the output for this sea
son will be about a hundred carloads.
Next year it Is intended that the crop
shall be double that quantity.
This Is the first instance in the world
of the shipment of a solid tralnload of
the succulent asparagus. Each car will
be properly adorned with banners set
ting forth the facts of the case and there
by advertising emphatically the proposi
tion that the East depends largely on Cal
ifornia not only for the necessities but
for the luxuries of life. The prospects
are that the industry will develop rap
idly, as the soil of the river bottoms and
islands of the State is particularly adapt
ed to the cultivation of the plant.
East of Chicago the train will go by
the Lake Shore Road, John A. Gill, Pa
cific Coast freight Agent, having Its man
agement in hand.
The advent of the enterprise was not
noisy, but it becomes particularly prom
inent by reason of the fact that to-mor
row there will be dispatched a special
train loaded with â¢ canned asparagus,
bound for New York City. The train will
consist of sixteen oars containing nine
thousapd cases, constituting a portion of
this scason'B crop.
A new industry has been launched in
California. anJ by the manner In which
it is developing in the first year of its
existence it promises to become an im
portant wealth producer. Asparagus is
the product, and the center of the in
dustry is Bouldln Island in the San Joa
quln River.

State's Product Becauss It Is
Better Than Can Be Pro
duced Elsewhere.

y 10 Third St., San Francisco. >Judge I-awlor did not hold court this morning, as he had business in his own
court that required his attention, and it was not until after 1 o'clock this after
noon that Mr. Uoardman commenced his argument to the Jury. He spoke about
an hour and a half, and the District Attorney occupied about the same time In
closing. Jt took the court about three-quarters of an hour to deliver Its charge
The case was given to the Jury about fifteen minutes to 5 o'clock, and It was
ehortly after C o'clock when they announced the verdict.
When seen this evening Mr. Eoardman, attorney for Fitzgerald, said: "I hava
not seen Fitzgrrald since the verdict to advise with him, but will do so before
Uavirig town. I cannot say Just what course we will pursue, but in all probabil
ity an appeal will be taken to the Supreme Court."
REDWOOD CITY, Au?. 4.â "Guilty of murder in the second degree.**
Such was the verdict of the Jury in the Fitzgerald murder case this afternoon.
It took the Jurors about an hour and a half to arrive at their verdict. - Some of
them voted for murder in the first degree and others for manslaughter, and it is
likely that the verdict, is a compromise one. The defendant did not express any
surprise at the vordict, taking things philosophically and remarking to his attor
ney. "That means more work for us."

"MURDER IN THE SECOND
DEGREE" THE VERDICT
"At a meetinp held o'n Wednesday night of a committee of boiler-makers.
machinists, blacksmiths and allied mechanics it -was resolved that the reduction
cf the staff was a direct blow by the company against the union under false pre
tenses cf decrease of business in connection with the failure of the wheat crop,
and that the company ignored whatever overtures were made to them for better
conditions. In the reduction of the staff the company practically aimed at the
active m^mbt-rs of the unions, that preference was given to non-union men, and
that efficiency and length of service were totally ignored."
By to-night's train from Seattle seven machinists arrived to take positions in
the local shops. They say they will be followed by others within the next few
days and in this way a sufficient staff of men will be put on here to attend to all
necessary repairs. Other men are said to. have been Imported to-day at other
places alor.g the line, so that the company appears now to be entirely guarded
against a tie-up. The decision of the general committee at the headquarters at
Winnipeg in cabling the strike was as follows:
VANCOUVER, B. C, Aug. 4.â The two features of the machinists' strike on
the Canadian Pacific Railway to-day were: First, that the boiler-makers and
blacksmiths as well as the machinists have gone out as far east as Montreal; and
eecond, that American mechanics are beiDg imported to take the places of men
here. The strike now practically extends over the whole system. If the strike
is not settled In Vancouver within a day or two the machinists say they will call
out the blacksmiths, carpenters and car repairers, so that then the whole ISO
ir.ea employed here will have quit work.

COAST NEWS IN BRIEF.
The electrician Is in great demand by
hunting parties that desire to utilize him
as a lure to attract unsuspecting game
into ambush. He intends hereafter to sit
backward in his saddle to guard against
rear attacks by ferocious deer that hunt
him over the hills.
"I was so flabbergasted at the gall of
the beast that I couldn't have hit a flock
of barns flying low," Huntsman Ortman
explained in a low, low voice.
'â¢That buck followed George for a good
five miles." says Rancher Brown, who
had himself been out in the hills with
his rifle that day. "From -a ridge on the
opposite side of the valley I could see
them off and on for an hour. The deer
trotted along behind George's horse and
when George would stop the deer would
stop.. During most of the time it was not
over fifty feet away, and I thought at
first George was leading a cow behind
him."

THE CHASE OF THE SPORTSMAN AS VIEWED FROM A RIDGE BY RANCHER BROWN,
The deer gave a reproachful look at the

by the pack of hounds that appeared a
few minutes later, following on its trail.
The deer Is still pensively browsing on

WeeHy Gall $1.00 cer YearLATTONVILLE,;Aug:. 4.-A message has been received from Sheriff Taylor
and posse now in Covelo, stating that they have located the man described by
Officer Grubbs and that Sheriff Taylor Is procuring a number of old. experienced
mountain trailersâ men who have won reputations In this county for daring In,
tracing outlaws. Taylor says his party will start to-night, when they expect to
surprise their man. The members of tho new posse comprise many of tho men
that ran down the slayers of Jack Llttlefleld.
Another messenger from tho mountain fastnesses who arrived earlier In the
day brings in news regarding the manhunting expedition. He states that tha
posses who are scouring the mountains for Murderer King are divided Into two
parties. One posse, under the direction of Sheriff Taylor of Marln County, ha*
started toward Redemeyer*s ranch on Rattlesnake Creek, In' which direction It
was learned the fugitive was heading. The other posse, under the direction of
Deputy Sheriff Grubbs, remained on the track, closely pursuing a man answer-
Ing the description of King and who was making a determined.. effort to eluda
his pursuers. On Thursday Officer Grubbs' party suddenly cam* up dose tÂ»
their man camped at the mouth of Rattlesnake Creek, each party discovering
the other at the same time. After ordering the supposed murderer of Church to
surrender the officers besran firing:, but with no particular result except that
the man fled, leaving his camp equipage behind, escaping with only a gun. a
horse and a. few rounds of ammunition. The fleeing 1 man then changed his course
from north to east and ate breakfast on Friday morning at a trapper's cabin
near Blue Rock. He was then heading: toward Trinity County, north of
Round Valley. He was next, located In a deep gulch near the Trinity line. This
was Friday night, and the posse decided to divide and one part remain above
and the other go below, and thus be ready to trap him In the morning; but day
light found the man had flown, and evidently he had passed close to his pur
suers during the night His trail was, however, found again leading toward tha
Yolo Bolle Mountains, and the messenger waa dispatched Into town with thl3
Information for Sheriff Taylor and posse, to keep a vigilant lookout. Taylor was
known to be going in the vicinity ot the direction taken by the fleeing man.

SHOOTS THE MAN WHO
HOLDS A WINNING HAND
Jefferson Dobbins Fatally "Wounds
Eldride B. Ball During a Quar
rel in a Card Game
at Vacaville.
Special, Dispatch to The CJall.
VACAVILLE, Aug. 4.â A shooting af
fray occurred to-day in the cardroom an
nex of the Elite Grillroom, resulting in
the fatal wounding of Eldride Boyd Ball
by Jefferson Dobbins.
Ball and Dobbins were playing cards for
money. Ball had just won and was in the
act of drawing the stakes toward himself,
at the same time talking to Dobbins.
Dobbins called Ball a liar, who in turn
applied the same epithet to Dobbins.
Dobbins arose from his cRalr with his
hand in his front right pocket. Fred
Pena, one of the witnesses, placed his
hand on Dobbins' shoulder, saying,
"Don't do that, Jeff," thinking he was
about to draw a knife.
Dobbins instead drew a pistol and fired
two shots at Ball, who was still seated
in the chair. One bullet struck Ball in
the right shoulder, disabling that arm,
and the other took effect in his abdomen.
The latter bullet the doctors have failed
to locate by probing.
- After the shooting Dobbins coolly
walked out on the street and up to his
room in the Opera-house building and
locked the dotr.
Deputy Sheriff Stadtfeld arrested Dob
bins later and was obliged to force him
into the carriage in waiting to take him
to Fairfleld. It is not expected that Ball
will live through the night. .

fore promptly vetoed the ordinance and returned
It to the Board of Trustees.
In additional explanation for my prompt re
turn of the vetoed ordinance to the Board of
Trustees I wish to state that I did so in order
to facilitate the plans of the State Agricultural
Society, which was anxious to have determined
the question whether or not poolseUln? would
bÂ« permitted In this city. The fair manage
ment wanted a decisive- answer, and wanted it
at the earliest possible moment, and I there
fore gave mine without delay. In taking such
prompt action I was also impelled by the hope
that the Board of Trustees, when they learned
I would not tolerate the licensing of poolrooms
would enact an ordinance that would meet the
exigency of the occasion; an ordinance that
would give, the State Agricultural Society all
they were asking for; that would give the peo
ple of this c*ty all they wanted, and all they
had been soliciting for and demanding, viz.: an
ordinance that prohibited the selling of pools
in this city at all places and at all times, sav
ing and excepting the fair grounds during the
holding of the races under the direction of the
State Agricultural Society. They did not pro
duce and pass such an ordinance, but passed
the Ing ordinance over my veto, and it is now
the law.
No Pool Selling Except at the Fair.
it is now within the power of the Chief of
Police, the President of the Board of Trustees
and myself to issue a license that will permit
the selling ofÂ«pool3 in this city.vFor myself 1
will state, as I have repeatedly. I shall not lend
my aid to nor countenance any proposition or
suggestion that will permit the selling of pools
at any place other than the State Fair Grounds
nor at any time other than while the races are
being actually run there. That was my position
when we took up the poolroom fight: that is
my position now, and as long as I am Mayor
of the city of Sacramento that Is where the
people will always find me.
This delegation of power on the part of the
Board of Trustees I did not consider proper
legislation. I was never in favor of licensing
poolrooms and had clearly and unequivocally
so announced myself in the early part of the
campaign against the poolrooms, and I there-
Not Proper Legislation.
opeciai xnspatcn to xne uax
ing of pools In this city, you want to know how
I stand, do you? You want me to declare my
self on the poolroom question; also to state
Â¦whether or not I am disposed to grant a li
cense permitting the poolrooms to run down
town generally, or to confine the selling of
pools to the fair ground and for the period the
races are conducted under the auspices of the
State Agricultural Society?
In messages to the Board of Trustees, in
speeches and In private conversation I have
expressed myself most emphatically on . this
question, and I have now nothing: to retract
in the position I then assumed and my opin
ions-have not undergone any change In the
slightest degree. I closed the poolrooms because
the people wanted them closed, and I shall do
my utmost- to keep them closed for the same
reason. I favored the. Dolan ordinance because
those -most Interested and - most familiar with
the State Fair have declared positively that its
success is in a great measure dependent upon
poolselling while the fair Is In progress. Ah
you 'know, the Dolan ordinance was an exact
copy of the ordinance- we battled so strongly
to have enacted when we began the fight
against the poolrooms. It permitted the selling
of pools on horse races at the racetrack while
the races were being run. It was an ordinance
that received the approval of the business men
und the amusement-loving: public In general.
The Board of Trustees, in their discretion, did
not see fit to pass it, but produced the Ing ordi
nance which provides that the Mayor, the Chief
of Police and the President of the Board of
Trustees may issue a license to sell pools.

SlClfAMENTO, Aug. 4.â Mayor Clark
late to-night gave to The Call cor
respondent a statement declaring
his position on the subject of the
poolrooms. Tha statement forma
the most Important local story of the
hour. It declares the Mayor's opposition
to the poolrooms and sets at rest any
fear that the- poolroom evil will ever
again fasten itself on this community, at
least eo long as Clark is Mayor.
As the result of a crusade against the
poolrooms an ordinance- was passed last
spring shutting down all forms of pool
selling. No objection had been found by
citizens to the legitimate sale of pools at
the State Fair races, and a month ago an
ordinanceâ known as the Trustee Dolan
measureâ was framed, excepting from its
operation the sale of pools on hona-fido
races and on the track grounds. Two
weeks ago, when the final action on the
ordinance was to be taken, Trustee Ing
presented a substitute licensing the pool
rooms, and it was passed over Mayor
Clark's veto and is now the law.
Mayor Clark has declined up to this
time to make a public statement as to
what course he .would pursue under the
existing ordinance. Since he has absolute
control of the situation, his statement has
been anxiously awaited. It is in sub
stance as follows:

to-day hy workmen on the F. M. Mills farm, adjoining Woodbridge. The bones
were fnund at a depth of two and a half feet and were perfect. Old residents of
* Woodbridge connect the skeleton with a tragedy long since past.
One night, marjy years ago, there came a traveler to Woodbridge who never

In the evening, Riving his name as Major Barnes, and after his dinner became
interested in a game of card?. He played long and late until his only opponent
was a half-breed Spaniard. That was the last seen of Major Barnes, and the
next day it was generally reported that he had been stabbed and killed by the
!.alf-brÂ«-ed. The latter was arrested, but even the body of Major Barnes had
disappeared and it could not be proved that the man was dead. The mystery of
Major Barnes'.dteappearance has passed down in the history of Woodbridge and
it is bc-iieved now that the bones found Wednesday are those of the missing man,
and that the half-breed, long since dead or missing, stabbed the traveler and
bulled the body to avoid conviction.

DEAD MAN'S BONES RECALL
A WOODBRIDGE MYSTERY
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO. Aug. 4.â Frederick Himes. 13 years old. to-day confessed that he
had bpen slowly poisoning his father, who is now dying at 'the county hospital,
by Fyptematically putting "Rough on Rats" in his coffee.' He was,, abetted In
th*> terrible deed by a younger brother.
Thp family consisted of the father, four boys and a girl. They moved .here
recently from Soqucl. where the mother died six months ago. The father and
ohiMren occupfed a email cottage on G street. Two weeks ago to-day Mr.
HtoM visited the watermelon ranch of his father-in-law, Nathan Hart, on
Kearney avenue, taking the children" with him. When the family returned that
CYfivSaz the boy Fred cooked the supper. Knowing that his father alone would
â¢".rink coffee, the lad placed in the pot a portion of a box of "Itough on Rats"
Â¦which he and his younger brother had bought at a drugstore the day before for
the purpose cf killing their father.
Soon after drinking tho coffee Himes began to complain of illness in the
region of the heart. Dr. Maupin was called In, but could not diagnose the case,
not suspecting that his patient had been poisoned. Himes was given medicine
and stimulants, however, and the next day was feeling better. Coffee being
bis favorite drink, he asked Fred to make him more of it, and the boy cheerfully
complied, each time adding a half teaspoonful of the "Rough on Rats."
Doctor Tries to Cure, the Boy Tries to Kill.
The Boy Makes Confession, of His Crime.
Medicine and stimulants were administered regularly by the physician and
poison was administered regularly by the boy. The poison finally prevailed and
two or three days apo Himes became unconscious and was taken to the hospital.
He bepan to revive at -intervals, but Immediately relapsed Into delirium, and Dr.
Davidson, the County Physician, says there is no hope for him.
The (Irtails of the crime would probably never have been known had it not
been for a boy named Elmer Martin, a cousin of the parricide. He was at the
Himes cottage when the first dose of poison was administered and was aware of
the plot. When Himes became 111 the Martin boy, who Is only 10 years old. got
rrightened and ran away, going to his own home In the country. He immediately
told his older brother of the poisoning, but Mr. and Mrs. Martin were away at
Santa Cruz and the older brother did not think seriously enough of the matter
to report it. When his father and mother returned, from the coast vesterday,
however, he informed them of what his brother had told him, and they imme
diately communicated the facts to Nathan Hart Jr. and George Hart, brothers-in
law of Hlmes. The Hart brothers took Fred Himes aside and questioned him.
At first he tried to evade their Questions, but finally made a clean breast of the
whole affair.
Deputy District Attorney Church interrogated the youthful criminal at thÂ«
Jail this afternoon. Without emotion he told how he had administered the pol
eox He axid his younger brother. Frankle, 9 years old, had bought the etuff at
a drugstore, he paying 15 cents and Frankle 10 cents of the purchase price.
"Why <!ld you put it in the coffee?" was asked.
Here the boy broke down for the flrst time and cried bitterly as he told how
Ma father had abused him. He said be had not seen his father until he was 2
years old and that the latter always bated him worse than any other member
of the family. "Father drinks a gooO. deal," said he, "and then he is always
worse."
ThÂ© boy 6*1(5 that "Rough on Rats" was the only form of poison he was ac
quainted with. He said hÂ» had noticed the effect on rats and thought It would
make his father pretty sick, anyway, if It did not kill him. If the father died,
. The boy said, he would get a chance to drive a team which Hlmes had purchased
_recently. His father, he said, had never permitted him to handle It. The boy
denied that he had given his father more than one dose of poison, but this does
not agree Â¦with the etory told by his younger brother.
The most remarkable crime In the history of Fresno County was
brought to light yesterday by the confession of Fred Himes, a lad 13
years old, -who coolly explained to the officers of the law how he had poi
soned his father by giving him coffee containing "Bough on Bats." The
father is lying at the County Hospital at the point of cfeath and the
youthful criminal is in jail. He makes no effort to extenuate his guilt
and his only excuse for the awful crime is that his father had mis
treated him.

Judge Cabaniss rendered his decision
yesterday rrominsr in the cape of \V. D.

Prltchard, charged with conducting a
game of chance in the shapo of a "tape
earae" Bt 43 Kllis Ftreet. The Judgf con
victed the defendants and ordered them to
appear for sentence to-morrow morning.
The trial of the case was marked by the
sensational testimony of G. W. Rumble
to the effect that Valentine on January 4
last told him he was making between
53000 and $10,000 per month and v.as paying
25 per cent to Phil Crimmins for protec
tion.
The Judge in rendering his decision said:
"Having heard the testimony and lis
tened to it very patiently, admitting such
of it as I thought 1 properly could with
out doing violence to the rules of evi
dence, I must say the only question which
seems to ;nt- to admit or serious consid

to whether the transactions which, ac
cording to the testimony, were had at the
defendant'* place of business <.m the day
in question \\>re different from the ordi
nary market transactions having to do
vitn the buying a:vl selling of mining
etocR. wheat or any other marketable
commodity. Mr. Collins, as I understand
him, insists that these transactions wÂ«Â»re
precisely of that character. Mr. Coffey.
on the other hand, expresses the view
that they wore not. Now, these transac

have not BO much of this character ttiat
the parties may seek to claim they are

of the operations that is to be looked to
Any features resembling the ordinary
market I believe to have been used as a

transaction."
The charge against the defendants of
conducting a lottery was continued till

Orders have been received by the quar

organize fifty four-mule wagon teams to
be shipped abroad as transportation offers.
A telegram was also received stating that
200 mules would be shipped to this coast
as soon as they had been sufficiently rest
ed, and authorizing the -quartermaster to
purchase as many more. This number of
mules organized into wagon trains in ac
cordance with army regulations will haul
over the roughest roads 150 wagons carry

orders read "for service in the Philip
pines," it is more than probable they will
be used to transport the immense amount
of supplies necessary to supply the army
of 20.000 United States soldiers that will
be sent to China.
Two horses of the Ninth Cavalry and one
of the Third Cavalry having developed the

hours after the injection of the fluid it can
be determined by the temperature of the
animal whether the disease is latent or if

Through the connivance of the Southern
PaclSc Company Chicago has contrived to
turn down San Francisco In the business
Of furnishing cats to the Government for
UFe in the Orient. The traffic has been
profitable to the port. Large benefits to
agriculturists and to dealers in oats
were in sight, lor military operations in
the Philippines and in China gave prom
ise of a steady demand. The Southern
Pacific people, looking on with greedy
eyes, saw that if they could haul all the
oat3 from Chicago bound for the Orient
they could get all the profit. The device
was to so fix the rate from Chicago to
Japan, China and the Orient generally
that San Francisco could not do any of
the business. Prominent local grain deal
ers say that a freezeout game has been
surely prepared.
Within the last few days copies of
sripeduie D have been received from the
oiiice of the Southern Pacific Company
by the grain men. One paragraph has
particularly, attracted attention. It. gives
a rate of 6") cents per cental on oats from
Chicago clear through to Japanese and
Chinese ports, whereas the rate from Chi
cago to San Francisco is 55 cents per cen
tal. This enables Chicago to land oats
at Oriental ports at $1 33 per cental. San
Francisco cannot meet that rate, say the
San Francisco dealers. Of course, the
Southern Pacific Company knew that
when the freezeout rate was made.
The first fruit of this deal was the ship
ment of lO.fJOO sacks of oats from Chicago
to China by the German Government. The
Great Northern Railway is in the field
and has prepared to get all the business
it can via northern ports. In the last few
days advertisements have appeared in Or
egon and Washington newspapers calling
for b'.ds for the delivery of 3000 tons of the
best quality of oats and 3000 tons of good
merchantable hay at Vancouver barracks
on or before August 11: also for bids for

Attorney General Tirey L. Ford has de
cided that Brigadier General M. W. Mul
ler of Fresno has the right of seniority
over Brigadier General Warfield, not
withstanding that the lawyer's predeces
sor. Attorney General Fitz&erald, decided
to the contrary. Muller was appointed In
1S91, but at the time of Warfield's appoint
ment, May, 1S95, was a retired ofiicer of
the National Guard. In October, 1S35, Mul
ler was again appointed brigadier general,
but his commission was dated November,
1891, notwithstanding his retirement. It
has long been the custom in this and oth
er States in the matter of appointments
as officers of the National Guard to ad
here as nearly as possible to the regula
tions of the United States army, which m
reference to matters such as this read
as- follows:
The. grades of rank are general, lieutenant
general, major general, brigadier general,
colonel, etc., and in each grade date of com
mission determines the order of precedence,
Between officers of the same grade and date
of appointment or commission, except - when
promoted by seniority, relative rank is deter
mined by length of service, continuous or
otherwise, as a commissioned officer- of the
United States, either In the regular army or
since April IS. 1S61. In the volunteer forces.
When periods of service are equal precedence
will, except when fixed by order of merit on
examination, be determined: First, by rank
!n service when appointed; second, by former
rank in the army or Marine Corps; third, by
lot, among such an have not been In the mili
tary service of the United States.
An officer on belnp wholly retired becomes
a civilian and can be readmitted to the ser
vice only by o new appointment In the grade
of secon-1 lieutenant, except by express author
ity of Congress.
According to Fitzgerald's opinion "VVar
fleld is senior over Muller by live months,
but Attorney General Ford opines that
Muller has four years the advantage In
service and is therefore entitled to prece
dence. The clashing of the opinions of
the legal gentlemen passes the matter up
to Governor Gage.

The murmur of complaint that has been
heard In National Guard circles for some
time In regard to its condition has reached
the commander in chief, who, it is re
ported, proposes to make an investigation
on his own account and not rely upon the
pro forma reports that are to be seen at
headquarters. If he does, this none will
be more pleased than the'merabers of the
guard themselves, who are ready and
willing to do all that Is demanded of
citizen soldiers. As -It Is /now, however,
they have fallen into a state of lethargy
from which they can be aroused only by
some heroic effort such as the commander
In chief It Is said contemplates.
The First Regiment is to be uniformed
at last. The uniforms are now in a ware
house and ready to be inspected, and then
distributed to the men. When the men
were apprised of this within the past
three days they expressed the hope that
.the distribution will not be hampered by
oflicial red tape, as they are anxious to
parade on September 10 in respectable
looking uniforms.
To what extent the National Guard of
this State will participate in the celebra
tion of the golden jubilee is still a matter
of doubt. The several organizations are
anxious to be in San Francisco to add to
the magnificence of the affair, but the
matter of transportation cannot be satis
factorily adjusted. It will require about
$5000 to bring the troops here and return
them to their respective localities. As Ad
mission day Is not one on which the guard
must turn out for parade the State will
not assist in a financial way. The finance
committee of the celebration does not feel
authorized to appropriate that amount of
money for military display. At present it
looks as if only the two regiments of the
Second Brigade, the First and the Fifth
Infantry, the Signal Corps and the troop
of cavalry located in this city will appear
in line.
At an informal reception and supper
tendered Colonel Beck, the new pay
master of the Governor's staff, a few
evenings since by the erstwhile pay
master, â¢ Colonel Chadbourne, the latter
formally turned over the office to his suc
cessor.
"With this," said Colonel Chadbourne,
"goes the insignia of office, the ace of
diamonds, which is to be placed on the
collar of your coat. Colonel -Beck, but in
my opinion, based on experience, that Is
not the proper insignia. It ought to be a
jimmy and a dark lantern."
Colonel Beck looked amazed.
"Yes,", continued Colonel Chadbourne,
"that is what it oupht to be, for during
my term when there was any need for
money I had to break into the treasury."
Captain D. A. Smith, adjutant of the
Fifth Infantry, has been detailed to pre
side at an election to fill a vacancy in the
office of captain of Company B, vice Part

Judge W. P. Lawlqr Indorsed.
â¢ The Forty-third District ' Democratic
Club ha3 Indorsed the candidacy of Judge
W. P. Lawlor for Superior Judge.
At It3 last meeting the Horace Davis
Club decided to form a permanent or
ganization and to meet once a month the
year round, campaign or no ' campaign.
Prominent men will be invited to address
these monthly meetings, matters of local
and national politics will be discussed and
measures will be adopted to secure clean,
anti-boss, representative politics for the
district. The Idea is certainly a good one
and deserves the -support of every voter
who is interested In pure politics. Among
the prominent members of the club are:
Horace Davis, president; A. E. Bucking
ham, treasurer; Fablus T. Finch, secre
tary: Supervisor George It. Sanderson: II.
L. Tlckner, manager tariff department of
"Wells. Fargo & Co.; Nathan H. Frank;
Election Commissioners Sheldon G. Kellog
and A. W. Voorsanjrer; Maurice Brandt.
Montgomery Baggs. M. Ehrman. H. O.
Beatty and "Warren Gregory. This club
holds its next meeting at Franklin Hall.
1S29 Flllmore street, on next Wednesday
evening. August 8.
The Dibble Club Is presided over by
Arthur "W. Spear and Is making strenuous
efforts to secure control of the district.
Members of the Davis club declare that
they are In the* fight to stay and. that
neither Dibble nor any of his Ilk who
have announced .their allegiance to the
Fifth and Market streets political ma
chine shall represent the Forty-first Dis
trict.
Republican boss and anti-boss factions
in the Forty-first Assembly District are
arrayed In a lively contest. The fight
seems to be centralizing around the elec
tion of an Assemblyman. The bosses con
trolling one club are endeavoring to se
cure the re-election of Henry C. Dibble
to the Assembly. Matters of great im
portance to San Francisco - are to come
before the next Legislature, hence their
activity.
The Kelly-Crimralns contingent realizes
the great assistance that Dibble could be
to them if they can place him in power.
They are particularly anxious to secure
hia election, for among other political
measures the Assembly districts of the
State are to be reapportioned and a new
primary election law Is to be adopted.

club i3 the club presided over by Horace
Davis and having on its roll of member

men of the district. Mr. Davis club de

mary election by a very considerable ma
jority, and although hampered by the fact
that the' Supreme Court has Invalidated

members feel sanguine of again defeat-

executive committee of the Dem
ocratic State Central Committee de
ll cllned to commit itself on the elec
tion or appointment of delegates to
the several conventions at a meeting
held in the California Hotel yes
tefday afternoon, preferring that the
unpleasant task should go to the Cen
tral Committee as a whole. It was voted
to change the date of the State conven
tion from August 30 to such time as the
Central Committee may fix at its meeting
to be held next Saturday. The reason for
changing the date of the State convention
was on account of the Supreme Court's
action in declaring void the law under
which the convention was called.
The' headquarters of the Democratic
State Central Committee were crowded
with members and visitors all yesterday
afternoon. A meeting of the executive
committee of the central body called out
the politicians. There was a big delega
tion on hand, who came as representativea
of the different Assembly districts which
had passed resolutions during the week
protesting against the appointment of del
egates to the several conventions by the
County Committee. It was lirst whispered
about that the meeting would be an ex
ecutive one, and the delegates were much
disturbed for a while lest they should be
barred from a hearing. The committee
got together shortly after 2 o'clock and
decided to hold an open meeting.
State Convention Postponed.
T O. Toland. a member of the State
Board of Equalization, presided. The
committee had evidently determined upon
a plan before going into session. A mo
tion by ex-Governor J. H. Budd that the
executive committee' call the State Com
mittee together and recommend that the
State convention, which was to have been
held August 30, be postponed until a week
or more later, met with no opposition and
the motion was speedily passed. This ac
tion will bring the Democratic convention
after the Republican convention.
C. O. Dunbar of Santa Rosa thought
that the State Central Committee should
be called together as soon as possible, as
there was much preliminary work to be
done, especially in the counties, and the
dates or the county conventions would
depend very largely upon the date of the
State gathering. He thought a meeting
should be set for not later than next Sat
urday.
J. Harvey McCarthy of San Diego also
favored a speedy meeting. The people In
his district, he sakl, were anxious to get
to work. In regard to delegates, he fa
vored their election by the voters in pref
erence to their appointment by the County
Committee.
Maguire Favors Election.
Judge Maguire favored immediate action
by the executive committee. He said thera
was a resolution relative to the primaries
pending from the last meeting, and he
thought it an opportune time to bring It
up.
Ex-Governor Budd preferred to wait
and see what action the Republicans
would take and then act accordingly. "We
cannot go astray if we first find out what
our friend the enemy is going to do," the
Governor said.
Judge Maguire said there was no ques
tion that the proper procedure in the se
lection of delegates was to have them
elected and not appointed. The club roll
The legislative committee, Frank II.
Gould chairman, held an executive ses
sion, at which the duties of the members
were outlined and a plan of work was
laid out. The press committee, of which
James P. Booth is chairman, also held a
meeting. It was decided to get out some
campaign literature for the party organs
in the interior at once. The press com
mittee is comprised of twenty-one mem
bers.
A convention, within the meaning of this act.
Is an organized assemblage of delegates, elected
by ballot at a primary election, and represent
ing a political party which, at the last election
before the holding of such convention, polled
at least 3 Der cent of the entire vote of the
State, county, city and county, district, or
ether Dolltlcal division for which tbe nomina
tions are to be made.
Ex-Governor Budd moved that a com
mittee consisting of Frank H. Gould.
Judge Magulre and Chairman Toland be>
appointed to confer with the legal com
mittee and report on the latter's inter
pretation of the following: portion of sec
tion 1136 of the registration and election
laws of California:
M. F. Tarpey. the National Committee
man, assured Buchanan that the interests
of the voters would be looked after and
that any attempt to give the County
Committee the appointive power would be
opposed.
Gould said he was as anxious to pro
mote the success of the party as anybody,
but he thought the primary question wa.s
one which properly belonged to the State
Committee. On motion of Judge Maguiro
the various resolutions were finally re
ferred to the State body and the delegates
present were asked to appear before the
State Committee and explain their griev
ances. Chairman Toland said that if the
executive committee should act on the
question and the State Committee took
an opposite course much confusion would
result.
Tarpey as a Peacemaker.
primary could be followed under the Â«*
rection and supervision of the County
Committee. Of course, thia question of
how and in what manner the delegates
should be elected is one that those who
have given the thing study and investiga
tion are expected to determine. ,
Frank Gould said there was only one
body that has any authority, That
la the State Committee. The ex
ecutive committee could do nothing' and
the discussion he considered "much ado
about nothing." The duty of the ex
ecutive committee, he said, is to proceed
with the executive portion of the cam
paign. There Is no man here prepared to
state authoritatively what would be the
right course for this body to follow in
regard to the selection of delegates, even
I* we had the power. Â¦ Hence it would be
the height of folly for us to attempt to
act. The State Central Committee la not
a dishonest body, and when they meet
here their wisdom will be manifest by
their actions.
At th , ls P oi nt one of the delegates. Law
rence Conlon. wanted to know If the com
mittee had received a set of resolutions
from the Bryan and Stevenson Club of
the Twenty-eighth Assembly District.
Being answered in the negative. Mr. Con
lon brought forward some resolutions and
requested Â».iat they be read to the com
mittee. They contained an emphatic pro
test against the appointment of delegates
by the county committee.
Mr. Gould moved that the resolutions aa
well as other communications received In
reference to the matter be referred to the
State Committee. This brought Senator
l>ucnanan. another delegate, to his feet,
and he declared vehemently that Goultl
was no Democrat and It would be the
likes of him who would bring about
Bryan s defeat. The speaker defied
oould s right to turn down the vlsltins
cieifgrates. They had come as representa
tives of several hundred voters who de
manded a say in the election of delegates
to the conventions. Buchanan became so
abusive that the sergeant-at-arms was
called for. but there was none at hand and
Buchanan finished his tirade.
Question of the Election or Appointment of
Delegates to the Several Conventions
Is Still Undetermined.

Ing. Christins Is haunted by' a dream of wealth
now 6tanding in the name of Henry Sals.; Who Henry

that Sals was once an entity, but his dream will be ac
cepted as proof that such Sals was. â¢'
â¢ Shortly after he had his dream Christins addressed a
letter to County Clerk Deane, presumably Inquiring about
Sals and the money. A nightmare for Mr. Deane followed

PLANO, Texas, July . 81, 1900.
William A. Deane â Dear Sir: In regard to your answer of
the 27th. I will cay that I had several dreams concerning Henry
Bals, first dreaming that he waÂ» In Dallas, Texas, had good prop
erty and wanted me to, have the same. A few nights after I had
another dreamand he was In San Francisco. Cal: The matter of
late has been bearing: very heavily on my mind and. I want you
to carefully examine the records and see if. there Is such a per-
Bon by the name of Henry Sals. Answer Boon and give me all
the Information you possibly can on the matter. Yours truly,
Â« . W. H. CHRISTINS.
A load will be lifted from the mind of Christins when
he receives County Clerk Deane's answer, but another
and a heavier one will be dumped on his heart, for from
the records it appears that Sals has thoughtlessly failed
to die In this vicinity and leave his money to Christins..'
Though no one In the office of the County Clerk is super-.
stitious, none believing in dreams, 'all. felt a sense of pity
for Christins and believed it their duty to 'see that Chris
tins' note was honestly answered, so Just for that purpose'
they looked \ up the record; - When f the search w-as com
pleted the County Clerk's deputies were of the opinion
that Christins' hopes were based on naught but a dream,
for they had failed to find the name \ of Henry ".Sals.'
Neither did they hear his voice from the grave, â¢ though
they often, looked behind them when searching as though
expecting Henry's aid in their arduous labor. - â¢ -

Charge Made That Terror
Forced Ann Olbrecht
to Make a Will
IF the allegations of heirs left behind by the late Ann
Olbrecht arc true, spirits were called from the halls
of death to haunt her and surround her with fear
and misery during her closing hours. When Mrs
Olbrecht died at the age of SO years she left behind her
an estate valued at 54000. Two wills were found disposing
of the estate. One is held by Sarah Borland, her niece
and in the document the holder Is named as the sole
devisee. The other, which is of prior date. Is held by
various relatives of the deceased. They claim the testa
ment In possession of Sarah Borland was not signed by
decedent, but is a fictitious document. In their contest
of this document hut two of the heirs appear as contest
ants of recordâ Maggie Ann Harper, a niece of dece
dent's sister, who resides in Bonoma County, and John
Cooke, a grandnephew. who resides in Alameda. Among
the allegations of the contestants, by proving which thev
hope to defeat the holder of the first-mentioned will, are
some that savor of the supernatural. They charge that
out of the dark recesses of the night Sarah Borland was
wont to call ghosts of the departed. In the mind of the
aged woman, which the contestants claim was under the
complete control of Sarah Borland, the hazy specters
rose before her only to waft away and leave behlrrU a fit
of terror that lived until her death.
When the old lady objected or refused to comply with
Sarah Borland's orders. Miss Harper charges that Sarah
would pinch and strike her. These means falling, Sarah
would take away the crutch with which Mrs. Olbrecht
supports herself, and then, as the old lady was unable
to move about, would starve her .into submission. At all
times, the contestant further claims, the deceased be
lieved that Sarah Borland exerted superhuman powers
over persons and things and had superhuman means of
punishing and terrifying all with whom she came In con
taut. In eddition, Mrs. Olbrecht. was In constant fear of
being poisoned, end while thus terrified was forced to
name Sarah Borland as sole devisee. .
In his contest John Cooke, In addition to the charges
made by Miss Harper, alleges that Sarah Borland, in or
der to more completely terrify aged Mrs. Olbrecht, called
upon ghosts and the. bodies of the dead to rise from their
graves to compel obedience to her commands. Thus ter
rified to the end. he claims Mrs. Olbrecht went to 'her
wave. ;Â¦..', -i-:.V t-

Jackson declares that to become a flrst

rule, the ex-soldier who applies for work
says he has disposed of the transportation

The session of the State Central Com
mittee yesterday was harmonious. The
presiding officer. Colonel Stone, and the
secretary. W. M. Cutter, were able to in
telligently answer every question but one.
That one was propounded by George C.
Ross of Â£an Mateo. Ke directed attention
to the fact that the committee had ac
cepted section 11S6 as the law requiring
conventions to be composed of delegates
chosen by ballot at a primary election.
Mr. Ross did not question the application
of the law. but cited the fact that dele
pates representing the Fifth Congres
sional District In the recent State con
vention at Sacramento were appointed,
he desired to know was whether a
Congressional District committee appoint
ed by delegates who were not chosen at a
primary election had power to call a
primary. The question was too deep and
far reaching for the chairman and the
latter simply dodged the issue by assert
ing that the State convention had nothing
to say in Congressional District affairs.
The plain truth is that the Fifth Con
gressional District Republican Convention
of 1S3S adjourned withdut appointing a
committee. J. Alva Watt appointed a
committee in the year lit J 9 and the com
mitteemen so appointed by him assume
That they constitute the governing body

Republican Committee Adopts Call.
The Republican State Central Commit
tee of California met at Golden Gate Hall
on Sutter street yesterday afternoon and
â¢unanimously adopted the newly framed
State Convention call, the original call
having been thrown out of gear by the
Stratton law decision.
Punctually at 3 o'clock Chairman George
Stone brought his gavel Into play. The
meeting did not take long in settling down
and after the roll had been called by
Secretary W. M. Cutter the business be
fore the committee was quickly disposed
of.
The roll called. Chairman Stone ad
dressed the delegates on the object of
their meeting.
"Owing to the ruling of the Supreme
Court on the Stratton primarv law." he
Faid. "the matter is now left in the hands
of the heads of parties throughout the
State. Hence ttic call to the State Commit
tee to assemble here <ind review the new
convention call ar.d consider u* adoption."
\V. S. Wood of San Francisco then
movea that the new call be considered
read and adopted. Delegate Lemmon of
Sarta Rosa disapproved of this course and
moved that the secretary read the new in
strument. It was so ordered. Wood then
took the floor and moved that the call
be adopted. After a little discussion by
the out-of-town delegates, who wished to
be enlightened on, some of the sections of
the call, it was unanimously adopted
Secretary Cutter then moved that the
following resolution be adopted by the
delegates:
nepoived That the executive committee of

California be and they are hereby given tlie
name j>owcr and authority to act on all mat
ters and questions, during- the Interim between

Which Several Favorites
Many of the hounds which were picked
by the talent to get well down in the
finals were beaten in the run-down of the
open stake at San Mateo Coursing Park
yesterday. Lowlander was first to break
the combination of the wise ones. In the
second course on the card Geary's Amer
ica was selected as a >^ood thing.
Recent fast performances by America
boomed his chances and odds of 3*3 to 1.
a fair price, were quoted. Lowlander put
up a stiff course, however, and got the
decision on a close score.
Prince Hal was unsighted in a no course;
with Benieia Boy and then beat him trq
the run off at 2 to I.
Sutton's Mayflower won a good go with
Swedish, and looks good for a chance in
the finals. Against Laurence to-day her
chances are good and the course should
be interesting.
Wild Tralee, on the short end, beat Jen
nie Wilson in a hard course.
Cronin's fast one showed much dash and
seems to be rounding to old time form.
It is not long ago that Wild Traloe took
tlrst money in most of the stakes in
â¢which he ran. Sylvanus went out to
King's Borderer in a close course, which
meant another disappointment. A good
play was made in this event with Syl
vanus as a 2 to 1 favorite, and following
closely Spiteful, another strong favorite.
was beaten by Master Davenport, who
showed best all the way.
Captain Cane's Greenhall put jap a
clever race against Crawford Braes. Ho
exhibited plenty of speed and many
looked for him well within the money at
the finish of the stake.
Best Bargain beat Little Sister, a 2 to 1
favorite, pointless, and will meet Battle
ship In the second round to-day. The
course should be a good one.
"Warship showed up lame, but mftnagea
to win a close race from Lear King.
Though he might recover sufficiently to
make a showing, he is against a hard one
in Regina R. No pools were sold on hid
course yesterday.
For Glory showed all kinds of speed
against Master Claire and her perform
ance and condition won her many backem
for her chances *as stake winner.
Flora McDonald was not In condition
and lost to JLR after an undecided. In
the no course she ran the hare almost to
the e3capeand scored the kill. J f.. II
was unsighted and never joined in. Flora
was a 5 to 1 favorite in the run off. but
the hard work handicapped her too heav
ily and JLR had things much his own
way. Tea Rose is in good position to
make a showing. The day's results, with

C. D. Haywards of. Redwood City called
at the headquarters yesterday and stated
that* the parlor of that place would parade
in force and with several novel features,
of which announcement will be made dur
ing- the coming week. ' .'Â¦.'â¢'Â»â¢
The three parlors of San Jose have
adopted elaborate plans for the parade.
The Native Daughters of Vendome and
San Jose parlors will ride in decorated
rigs?. The feature of the Santa Clara
County section will be an elaborate float,
which. It is promised, will equal if not
surpass the famous prune horse sent from
Santa Clara to the World's Fair. San
Jose will furnish as aids to the grand
marshal, H. W. McComas of Palo Alto
Parlor. J. M. Shilue of Observatory Parlor
and Homer Prindle of San Jose Parlor.
Oakland and Alameda parlors promise
an elaborate display. Athens Parlor will
maintain headquarters at the Mechanics'
Pavilion. .
Marshall Parlor has selected Leo Blchel
to act as aid to the grand marshal.
Among parlors from the interior which
promise to be in evidence during the cele
bration Is Sacramento Parlor No. 3, the
second oldest parlor In the order. It
stands very near the head of the list in
point of membership, having 325 active
Native Sons on its rolls. It numbers
among its members men in all ranks of
life and has many prominent In local and
State official life. Among its past presi
dents are Mayor George H. Clark of Sac
ramento, Deputy Attorney General Charles
H. Post and State Highway Commissioner
Frank D. Ryan. Sacramento Parlor, In
the past, has been honore>d with two
grand presidentsâ H; Clay Chipman. 'who
died in Sacramento last year, and Frank
D. Ryan. '
Mych of brilliant color is to be shown in
the regalia selected for the various offi
cers of parade. Grand Marshal Costello
Is to wear a gold silk scarl, black slouch
hat with ostrich plumes And gauntlet
gloves. He will carry a baton and his
saddle cloth will be white. Major Charles
A. Boxton. chief of staff, la to wear the
regular fatigue uniform of his rank in
the army. Chief Aid Charles H. Stanyan
will wear a red silk sash, black slouch
hat with white plumes and white gloves.
His saddle cloth will be blue. Each mar
shal of division will wear a gold silk
scarf, black slouch hat with gold plumes
and gauntlet gloves, and is to carry a
baton. The saddle cloth of such marshals
will be white. Aids to the grand marshal
are to have a blue saddle cloth. The re
galia will consist of white silk sash, black
slouch hat with white plumes and white
gloves. Each^ald to a division marshal
will wear- a red. white or blue silk sash,
black slouch hat, with white plumes and
white gloves. The saddle cloth of the
aids is to be blue.
The Berkeley Fire Department has de
cided to participate in the parade.
John L. Herget has suggested the Idea
of a monster athletic, entertainment to be
givc-n for the benefit of the celebration
fund.
All those who feel that they desire to con
tribute, and have not yet been called on, will
note that we will be pleased to receive their
checks at the headquarters at the Palace Hotel.
The work of the committee has been very
much hampered by having to call three, four
and even five times on the same party. If the
merchants will make up their minds as to the
amount of money they will contribute and be
ready when the collectors call, it will greatly
facilitate matters.
We expect the celebration will brlrisr at least
100,000 people to the city and over $500,000 W lll
be left amonff the merchants and citizens of the
municipality.
On the other hand, this Is a State celebration,
commemorating the admission of our State Into
the Union. Thin must appeal not only to men
and women born in the State, but tho.Â«e who
have made it tlielr homes.
The Impression m-pms to be that this is a
purely Native Fons of the Golden West cele
bration. While this is In part true, the Native
Sons have undertaken this celebration In order
to ghow to the world: not only State pride and
patriotism, but that San Francisco is free from
plaeue.
The members of the finance committee, â¢ be
lieving that every good citizen is . willing to
contribute his pro rata tn the celebration of
ih* fiftieth anniversary- or the admission of
California into the, Union, appeal to the mer
chants of the city of San Franciseo to make
their contributions as early as possible. .
The subscriptions to the Admission day
celebration have been liberal, but as the
work of soliciting is necessarily slow.
Chairman George A. Newhali of the
finance committee. In order to hasten the
collections, issued the following circular
to the public yesterday:

WINNING YACHT AEOLUS, THE CORINTHIAN PRIDE.
CHALLENGE CUP
IS WON EASILY
BY CORINTHIANS
FUND FOR THE
CELEBRATIOM IS
GROWING SLOWLY
Swift Sloop Mo\u& Defeats
the Gadder by Ample
Margin.
Losing Yacht Does Not Stand "Up to
the Stiff Breeze and Is Not
Handled to Best Ad
vantage.
The dual yacht race between the sloops
Aeolus and the Gadder was sailed yes
terday and victory perched upon the ban
ner of the swift Corinthian sloop. As a
result of the race the San Francisco per
petual challenge cup will change hands.
The present holders must now deliver It
to the Corinthians, whose representative,
the Aeolus, defeated the Gadder by a
margin of 25 min. 30 sec, corrected time.
The preparatory whistle was blown on
the steamer Sunol at 12:55 p. m,, and five
minutes later the starting gun was fired.
Neither yacht was eager to cross the rine,
the Gadder doing so at l:0S:51 and the
Aeolus at 1:09:06. The course was from
Powell street to a stakeboat anchored
five-eighths of a mile from Southampton
Shoal buoy, thence back across the start
ing line, thence to a stakeboat anchored
off the Fort Foint wharf, thence home
across the starting line. On the first leg
of the course, a broad reach, there was
little to chooso between the two boats,
but when" the windward work commenced
the Aeolus at once began to show her su
periority. She outpointed and outfooted
the Gadder. Both boats at starting were
reefpd. but shook out their reefs while on
the first leg. As soon as the Gadder be
jz:an to beat to windward she seemed ten
oer. and her helmsman repeatedly luffed
her. On the reach the Aeolus set her bal
loon jib, watersail and topsail, and on the
beat was kept well down to her work.
Long before the windward stakeboat was
reached the result of the race, barring
accidents, was beyond doubt.
The Aeolus was excellently handled by
Carl "Westerfeld. whose crew consisted of
R. H. Morrow. J. C. Brickell, F. E. Scho
ber and J. Short. The Gadder was sailed
by Charles Chapman, assisted by a crew
of employes of Matthew Turner's ship
yard at Benieia. The wind was stiff, but
fairly steady, and the sea was moderate,
though heavy enough to drench the crews
of both craft.
The leeward stakeboat was rounded by
the Gadder at '1:45:00 and by the Aeolus a't
1:46:55. The regatta committee was not
able to take the time of rounding the
windward stakeboat. but the Aeolus fin
ished at 4:17:5Â« and the Gadder at 4:48:18.
The elapsed time of the Aeolus- was 3
hours 8 min. 50 sec. and the Gadder 3
hours 39 min. 37 sec. As the Gadder was
entitled to a time allowance of 5 min. 7
sec, her corrected time was 3 hours 34
min. 30 sec.
The race was under the management of
the-regatta committees of the San Fran
cisco and Corinthian Yacht clubs. Com
modore W. N. McCarthy's schooner Ra
mona was the leeward stakeboat and A.
J. Young's sloop Clara the windward one.
It was the general opinion among the
yachtsmen who saw the race that the
Gadder would have done better' windward
work had she not shaken the reef out of
her mainsail, as her helmsman seemed
afraid to sail her for all there was in her.

SACRAMENTO. Aug. 4.â Oakland de
feated Sacramento by a score of 4 to 3
this afternoon, outplaying the leaders at
every point. "Chief" Borchers, for the
visitors, pitched a magnificent game, hav
ing absolute command of his delivery at
all times, while. Doyle was occasionally
wild, walking five men and presenting
the "Chief" with a promenade by hitting
him on the head with a pitched ball. The
main feature of the game was McLaugh
lin's work at the bat and in the field.
He lined out three hard drives and ac
cepted some of the hardest chances that
have been seen on a Sacramento diamond.

. -Winner.
O T- â
San Francisco 6, Stockton 5.
Unusually fast baseball kept the small
crowd at Rycreation grounds yesterday
afternoon gasptng for breath during the
last section -of; the game. Until the last
of the ninth Inning it was a brown-stone
front against a mud hut that Stockton
would win out. Then the surprise came
that, meant another Inning and the thir
teenth victory for the local team out.cf
the last fifteen games played -by it.
Erratic Heine Krug was In a measure
responsible for the sudden change yester
day.; Pabst, Sullivan and Levy found
themselves on the sacks , when Heine
walked along with his stick. Far into
the left territory went his drive, and two
runs with Krug dancing on second made
the local fanatics exult. It was Reilly's
hit that tied the score. Victory finally
came in the. tenth, when San Francisco
punched Whalen hard and often. Until
the ninth Whalen's curves were puzzlers,
but then the fireworks " began to sizzle.
Pabst proved a show in himself, four hits
being his day s work with the stick. M'c-
Oucken -grave a similar performance.
Mtzpatrlck was easy to hit right through
the game, but received good support
. n A he , VPry fim 'rmlng Hank's children
set the boy at the score board to work,
lwo men were given choice plats in the
cemetery when Schwartz rolled out a sin-
Sle. Then "Brewer" Pabst took the stick
and swatted an easy fly to right field,
which Courtney failed to pocket and
Schwartz coursed the bags, Pabst reach
ing third. A steal was in line and he
scored. Sullivan retired the side.
Stockton bogan work in the second.
Streib was thrown four bad ones, stole
second and found his way to third on
Lockhead's hit to Fitzpatrick, who threw
too hard for Pabst to hold. By some
moth-eaten throwing Streib scored, and a
double by Moore soon after sont Lock
head over the rubber. Babbit fanned
thrice and Courtney followed suit. Wha
len's out sent Stockton to the field.
In the seventh Stockton broke the tie.
Whalen jogged to first, stole second and
took the. third station by the same pro
cess/ MeGucken. who had his eagle eye
working yesterday, came to the plate and
rolled out a three-bagger that Reilly could
not stop along the third-base line. Whalen
scoring on the play. Pace was given his
base on balls and soon after stole second.
A passed ball gave MeGucken a run.
Streib followed with a hit and Pace
crossed the rubber. This made the score
5 to 2.
The first of the ninth looked like a
slaughtering of locals, but something
strange happened, and although McCar
thy. MeGucken and Pace crowded the
bags on as many hits they were all dead
ones as far as runs were concerned. In
field hits of succeeding batters put Stock
ton into the field.
The last of the ninth was a bit of a
ferment. Pabst took the initial bag on a
hit- and was forced to second, when Sulli
van was given four bad ones. An error by
Lockhead put Levy on first and the bags
were crowded. Krug came to the bat for
a double, Pabst and Sullivan scoring.
Levy going to third. Then Reilly rapped
a single to right and Levy scored, but
Krug was caught, having slipped between
third and the plate. While this was going
on Reilly reached the middle station.
Fitzpatrl'ck went out. and this made two
dead. Brockhoff followed ana Frisco went
to the field for the tentrf.
Moore began this inning with a hit, but
Courtney fouled out. Whalen's out shct
Moore to second, but McCarthy flew to
Levy, and Frisco had its chance with the
stick. Hildebrand started by a bunt and
was safe. Schwartz, next up, had no
chance to hit the spheroid, four bad ones
being his portion, and then Pabst hit to
right and the game was over.
The score: .

IN THE VARIOUS FORMS OF GENERAL
debility and convalescence following- certajn
diseases, such la the lowered standard of the
vital nrocesses that the function of no organ la
perfectly performed, and wits the resulting de-
pression the patient has a REAL weakness.
Th* physician's first thought, under these con-
ditions, is nerve and other tonics.
Not Weakness-
Symptoms !
By far the rreater number of patients, how-
ever, seeking relief for so-called "Weakness" is
furnished by healthy and robust men. On ex-
amination, we find a Prostate Gland which has
been damaged by either a contracted disorder
or early dissipation. These patients have no
weakness at all. Prematureness, Loaa of Vital-
ity, etc.. are the symptoms, or disordered func-
tion, of the chronically Inflamed prostate stand
WÂ» find by curins this Inflammation that full
vltror at once returns. It should be understood,
that tonics, electricity, etc.. might cure a real
weakness, but would do harm In Inflammation
The main object Is to reduce the size of thÂ«
tender, nwollen and inflamed prostate. This we
accomplish by local treatment, thus avoldln?
drugs. Men who have unsuccessfully treatM
for a weakness should now understand the
cause of failure. We send free on application Â«

Â¦In one of these plain white garments, with, trousers to
match and a suitable cap or hat, the average man' cannot; but'
feel at once cool, and well dressed. There can be no charge of
lack of propriety, for the cut and finish make the new garment
at once a shirt and a summer coat. It Is no more undress than
the soft shirt, for the material is heavier than that of the
average summer, shirt and its' sleeves with their narrow 'cuff
bands are not so different from the sleeves of the light summer
coats so much worn. The band at the belt and the plaitlngs
give it a coat finish and all that is really negligee Is the tie or
collar on the outside, j . :â¢.Â«Â¦;. . .; ' .. . -
The "shirt waist- man" Is one of the leading topics dis-
In material It is of .all. sorts, to suit the wearer's fancy or.
convenience, but heavy percale, madras or French pique are the
most popular. Some of the bosoms are plain, but more are
plaited in folds from an inch to an inch and a half wide. These
plaits are also seen on the back aÂ« well as the bosom, although
some of the backs are plain. The plain white material is often
cst shown, the figured stuffs looking somewhat outre and being
a little too startling to suit timid man. , .
The shirt waist for men is not like that worn by women, a
thing of filmy and almost transparent texture. Nor has it the
commodious sleevea of the latter. It Is a blouse to 'be worn
over the. undershirt and suspenders or belt. Â¦ It has the low
collar of the usual soft shirt, or it may be had with neckband
only, permitting the wearer to use a detachable collar of any
sort which suits his fancy. *
The adoption by men of the shirt waist in New York has
stirred up all kinds of complication in that city, and the fact
that the man with the shirt waist is on his way West opens
up a vista of queer probabilities. As a matter of fact, this new
wrinkle in men's apparel is simply an emancipation proclama
tion on the part of men who suffer during the torrid season
from a superfluity of clothing. Consequently he feels like
taking off his coat, and in doing so, and in so declaring his
rights to do so, he has become the "ehirt waist man."

"Another chap I know doesn't pay the

That's because he spends his money on
expensive cigarettes. He smokes only the

a fiend and smokes probably forty a day.
You couldn't hire him to smoke a do
mestic cigarette, which costs half a cent.
Yet if he did he could afford to dress him
self as he should. I could cite numerous
instances of this tendency to extrava
gance, which have come under my per

as a lack of mental balance,"âPhiladel

declared, by slapping Mrs. Legault

Providence Journalâ The discussion about the propriety or
impropriety of a man's casting aside his coat in warm weather
and appearing without it on the street continues In many quar
ters. The consensus of opinion is that the: custom is justifiable
within certain limits. â¢ Meanwhile the .practice spreads.
Richmond Timesâ Everybody favors the Shirt Waist Club in
Richmond, and there Is little doubt that it is destined to be
come a reality. -.The organization has taken on some form, and
a movement Is now on foot to get the style started. t The club
Is. being pushed along by some of the most prominent society
and. business men In the city. Many of the clothing stores,
eeeingthe wave'of approval for the new style, have ordered
belts and shirts that will be just the proper thing.
Birmingham News â The subject of the shirt waist for men
is certainly-one Â¦which would seem to demand serious consid
eration.at least In the large cities where the mortality is very
great as a result, of the excessive heat.
Richmond Dispatchâ Anent the discussion upon the ouestlon
of coat or no during the dire heat of the summer, we reel im
pelled by common honesty to say that a man of good figure
appears well enough In business quarters in his (negligee) shirt
sleeves, while one who has been scantily endowed with sym
metry appears at a disadvantage.
Cincinnatl Commercial-Tribuneâ The junction of the shirt
and trousers cannot be made to look like the smooth meeting
place of the skirt and the shirt waist. There are physiological
difficulties that cannot be overcome. A man dressed in accord
ance with the suggestions will look just as uncouth as form
less woman without a corset. Comfort can be secured, but not
beauty of contour. â¢ .
cussed at the present time in the East. Here are the views of
some of the newspapers:
Boston Transcript â Give the business man his shirt waist,
by all means, this hot summer of averages awry and nearly
au records broken. But before he gets too familiar with, that
style of comfortable clothing and meditates extensive varia
tions on the theme, let us decree at once no lace effects nor
open work nor embroidery or the like shall ever be used by
him. even If it does in theory if not in reality conduce to his
coolness. . '.-â¢....
There has been an advance In the price
of petroleum, due to the supply being
less than the demand. Within the past
few days contracts have been made with
some of the larger producers In Los An
geles under which. their entire output will
be taken for several months to come at
the rate of $1 25 per barrel. The threat
ened large . increase In the price of coal
has stimulated some manufacturers to
look about for cheeper fuel, which they
find in petroleum. Then a systematic at
tempt has been made to market petroleum
and fair success has been the result. The
railroads are constantly preparing to be
larger consumers of fuel oil. Many new
uses are being discovered. Many miles of
streets in southern cities heretofore
sprinkled with water will be oiled. Over
1400 barrels of oil were shipped from Los
Angeles in June to. ranchers for use in
creating power to be employed in irriga
tion. Contracts have been made in this
city for many thousands of barrels. There
are several leading causes to make a
shortage, as will easily be seen. The price
has gone up sympathetically.
The Los Angeles Times gives the fol
lowing particulars concerning another
large transaction in oil lands:
David C, Cook has sold the Temescal Rancho
to a party of local bankers and other capital
ists for a price that is said to be in the neigh
borhood of JoCO.OoO. The rancho is situated in
Los Angeles and Ventura counties and con
tains besides the town site of Piru about 14,000
acres. Of this holding 1000 acres is exception
ally good agricultural land, and there are 11,000
acres of hill land, declared by experts to be oil
bearing. The purchase was brought about by
W. W. Xeuer of the Central Oil Company, who
with his associates have decided to incorporate
the Piru Oil and Land Company and develop
the property on a large scale. It is stated that
the company will soon erect an Immense ma
chine shop at Piru City, which is a few mlies
from Santa Paula.' Among, the men who are
Interested In the new enterprise are: \V. \V.
Neuer, Senator Robert N. Bui la, W. G. Kerck
hoff. J. F. Sartori. "\V. H. Cook. Thomas

Sprague, mentioned above, is a member of the
largest wholesale grocery firm of Chicago and
Is a director in the Pullman Palace Car Com
pany and of the Santa Fe Railway Company.
Professor W. L. Watts of the State Min
ing Bureau will issue a bulletin soon, tell
ing of his observations in the oil fields of
California and furnishing much available
information. He is now examining the
fields In Kern County.
A plan has been formulated by the gen
eral committee appointed by the oil men
of Kern County for the purpose of con
trolling the price of oil. The plan Is. in
brief, to organize a corporation, the stock
of which is to be taken by owners of pro
ducing wells In $100 lots for each well. The
stockholders must contract to give the
association the exclusive right to handle
their yield. The scope of the organization
at present includes only the oil fields of
Kern County. In order to keep out wild
cats, no company will be admitted , to
membership which has not at least, one
producing well; -and in order, further, to
keep the stock out of the hands of specu
lators. It Is designed that no dividends
shall be paid, but. If any surplus fund ac
cumulates from the profits of one year, it
is to be applied to the expenses of the
next. In this way the income will be cut
down to the actual cost of handling the
oil.
An operator has been explaining to the
Bakersfleld Californian the advantages
that will arise from the producers' asso
ciation. His principal point Is that enough
fuel can be guaranteed to warrant large
and long-time contracts. There are large
consumers who would take 20.000 barrels
per month, he says, if they could be as
sured of the full supply. No single com
pany could guarantee that, but It Is possi
ble of accomplishment if all the compa
nies In Kern County will combine. The
association would be like a reservoir In a
canal system, providing against freshets
and shortage. Then markets can be found
better by an association than by individ
uals.
The Los Angeles Times reports that op
erators in the Kern River District intend
to carry their patronage to the Santa Fe.
Several weeks ago the Southern Pacific
agreed to build a spur into the district,
but on the refusal of the property own
ers to deed outright the strip necessary
the company refused to build the road,
and the property holders have built about
three miles at their own expense. It is
now said that they will continue the road
to the Santa Fe line, a distance of five
miles.
A derrick in the Kern River district
bears a sign In large letters. "O. II. C."
The symbols being Interpreted. Inform
the reader that the company Is prepared
to go to "Oil, H or China." The start
is made with eleven and live-eighths cas
ing.
The contention of at least one set of oil
claimants as against a scripper In the
Kern River district has been s^t forth In
a brief prepared by Attorney Frank H.
Short of Fresno in the case of J. P. El
wocd et al., protestants and mineral
claimants, against J. R. Johnston, lieu
land claimant. The principal point made
by the attorney Is that where a miner in
good faith has entered upon lands appa
rently mineral and has In good faith lo
cated a mining claim, posted his notice
and taken actual possession of the mine,
and is in good faith developing It and
prospecting for mineral, independent of a
technical mineral discovery, where the
general conditions and his location and
operations indicate its mineral character,
the land is not subject to the provisions

Mrs. Hawley was one of the many who
lost their all by the peculations of Hall.
He had for years been the close friend
and confidential agent of her husband
and nothing was more natural than that
she should go to Hall for advice when her
husband died. She trusted Hall as im
â¢plicity as had her husband. The result
was the complete wreck of her estate.
More than $75,000 was stolen. The revela
tion was too much and under the strain
the impoverished widow's reason gave
way and she became a hopeless mental
wreck.
More than usually distressing was the
situation. Mrs. Hawley occupied a promi
: ner.t place in the social and philanthropic
activities of Oakland, which had been her
home for many years^ She led in chari
table movements. Much of her time and
effort was given to the Ladies' Relief So
ciety homes. When the crash came noth
| ing was left but a homestead at Seventh
I avenue and East Fourieenth street.
Mrs. Hawley v.as C6 years of age and a
native of Rhode Island. One married
; daughter resides at Santa Cruz.
The funeral of the late Mrs. Harriet
Hawley. widow of the late G. T. Hawley.
who was a member of the former grocery
firm of Hawley Brothers, San Francisco,
was held to-day. To the friends who gath
ered at the b'.er to take part in the simple
service the scene was one of more than
usual pathos, for the exercises marked the
close of a life which had been marred by
most saddening incidents.
For ten years Mrs. Hawley had been a
patient at the State Hospital at Stockton,
where she died Thursday. Her ,mind had
given way under a great sorrow, the loss
of her fortune by theft committed by one
of her trusted friends and advisers. The
man who brought ruin upon this unfor
tunate woman was John Hall, "Honest
John Hall." who tied from San Francisco
a. decade ago, an embezzler of $300,000. the
money of scores of widows and orphans
intrusted to his care.

LABOR DAY TO
BE CELEBRATED
BY ALL UNIONS
AT.AMEDA, Aug. Â«.â Ten-year-old Eva
"Winckelman was so bafily beaten by Mrs.
;2j1zz1* Caufleld, who weighs 200 pounds,
that, according to the testimony of the
Â¦jP^Eldan who treated the child, she was
-unable to appear at the trial in Justice
Morris' court this afternoon. In revenge
for her arrest for battery Mrs. Caufleld
ewore to a warrant for the arrest of the
little girl, charging her with batten*. Con
Â¦table George E. Clarke could not serve
â¢tha warrant because of tho serious con
dition of the child.
The assault on Eva "vTlnckelman took
place Wednesday evening in front of the
vVlackelman home at lOlu Pacific avenue.
The Caufleld childrei and the Winckel
laan children do not get along. During
a hair-pulling bee last Sunday night Mrs.
CauSeld'e children got the worst of it.
SJrs. Caufleld lookeo for a chance to re
taliate in behalf of her children, and made
an attack on Eva. the child, who was
c landing beside her mother. Seizing her
Â£yy the hair Mrs. CaufieM puiU-d the child
ferouud awhile and then knocked her
down and pummeled hor with clenched
tuiis about her body. Neighbor* say she
stamped on her. 'Ihe child's mother is a
frail woman, and whtu she attempted to
Interfere was pushed violently away.
When Mrs. Caufleld finally exhausted
Jiersolf the child was so badly hurt that
the was unable to move. The mother
picked her up and carried her into the
fcouse. L>r. A. A. sUafrerd was summoned.
He found the child Buffering from a num
ber cf injuries about the hips and abdo
jxnen. from which she will not recover for
t-.-r.-- time.
Mrs. Winckeiman swore to the com
plaint for Mrs. Caufield's arrest. When
the case was called for trial this after-
Sioon Mrs. Winckelman told her siory of
the assault, which was corroborated bv
Albert Riley. who was playing with the
Winekelman children. Mrs. Caulield ad
mitted that she niid laid violent hands on
Eva Winckelrr.an. She said that she had
XJot intended to injure the girl, but in her
rajre had forgotten herself.
"While I think the defendant is techni
cally guilty of battery, still I will follow
The advice of her attorney and dis-
Tniss the charfre."'
These words c:\me from Justice Morris
Â¦when the testimony from both sides was
In. The attorney for the defense had sug
pestrd that neighbors* â¢ quarrels should
not be settled in court, and the Justice
agreed with him. Another suggestion
from the defendant's attorney that the
charge of battery against the 10-year-old
e:rl be dismissed went unheeded.

THE DOCTOR'S Râ E. W. G.. City.
The following j Is gH-en as the origin of
the letter R used by doctors when writ
ing prescriptions: "During the middle age.
when astrology prevailed, a character
very much like the Roman R was the
sign of Jupiter, the preserver of health.
The phj-slcians then being equally de
voted to the science of medicine and of
astrology Invariably began their prescrip
tions with these words: 'In the name bf
Jupiter, take the following doses In the
order set down hereinafter.' In the
course of time this formula was abbrevi
ated, until at present only the letter R.
with a diagonal dash across its face re
mains to teach .us that medical art was
at one time associated with the science of
the stars.
SOCIALISM â ANARCHY â INDIVID
UALISMâJ. F. C. City. Socialism is a
term that. denotes a class of opinions op
posed to the present and historical organi
zation of society, and seeking to introduce
a new distribution of property and labor,
in which organized co-operation rather
than competition should be- the dominat
ing principle, under the conviction that
the happiness of the human race, and es
pecially of the classes without capital,
would be procured or greatly advanced
thereby. Anarchy Is a state of society
without any regular government, when a
country Is torn by the strife of parties
and no law or authority remains. Individ
ualism Is the principle of doing according
to one's own will, or for one's own end.
as opposed to associate action or common
Interest.
LABELS ON TIN-Subscriber. Hermo-
Billo, Sonora. Mexico. The following is
given as a means of sticking labels to
tinned plate: "Dissolve Isinglass in acetic
acid, then brush thÂ» labels over with it.
There will be no cause to complain of the
labels coming off, nor of striking through
thfi paper. Take a wide-mouthed bottle,
fill It about two-thlrtls with commercial
acetic acid and put in as much isinglass
as the liquor will hold, then set aside In
a warm place until completely dissolved.
When cold it should form a Jelly. To use.
place the bottle In hot water. The cork
should be well fitting, perfectly sound and
smeared with vaseline or melted paraf
flne."
Another method Is to make a paste of
two parts dexterine, tow parts gum ara
ble, five parts water and one part alcohol.
DISPLACEMENTâ H. M. J.. Arizona.
Displacement Is the quantity Of liquid
which is displaced by a solid body placed
into It. If the weight of the displacement
is greater than, or equal to that of the
body, the latter will float. If leas. It will
sink to the bottom. A buoyant material
sinks to the level where the pressure of
the liquid in which it Is placed is sufficient
to counterbalance its weight. The torm
Is most frequently used In connection
with war ships, as a ship of 3000 displace
ment. Displacement tonnage is found in
the same way as register tonnage, except
that measurements are made, not along
and from the tonnage deck, but from the
load water line, and the final cubic content
is divided by thirty-five.

A Most Remarkable Remedy That
Quickly Restores Lost Vigor
to Men.
A Free Trial Package Sent by Mail
to All Who Write.
Free trial packages of a most remark-
able remedy are being mailed to all who
will write the State Medical Institute.
They cured so many men who had bat-
tled for years against the mental- and
physical suffering of lost manhood that
the Institute has decided to distribute
free trial packages to all who write. It
Is a home treatment, and all men who
suffer from any form of sexual weakness
resulting from youthful folly, premature
loss of strength and memory, weak back,
varlcocele or emaciation of parts can now
cure themselves at home.
The remedy has a peculiarly grateful
effect of warmth and seems to act direct
to the desired location, giving strength
and development Just where it Is needed.
It cures all the Ills and troubles that
come from years of misuse of the nat-
ural functions and has been an absolute
success In all cases. A request to the
State Medical Institute, 328 Elektron
building, Fort Wayne, Ind., stating that
you desire one of their free trial pack-
ages will bÂ« complied with promptly. The
Institute m desirous of reaching that
great class of men who are unable to
leave home to be treated, and the free
6ample will enable them to see how easy
It Is to be cured of sexual weakness when
the proper remedies are employed. The
Institute makes no restrictions. Any man
who writes will be sent a free sample,
carefully scaled In a plain package, so
that its recipient need have no fear of
embarrassment or publicity. Readers are
requested to write without delay.

DEAR SIR â life advertised a piece of property on 33d street,
this city, in several San Francisco papers last week, including
an insertion for three times in your Oakland Real Estate Column,
and are glad to say that we sold the property through the medium
of your paper. We have always met with good results from adver-
tisements in the ''CALL,' 'and must say that they always pay for
themselves several times over with direct business.

The undertone cf the market was firm. owlnÂ«
to ti-e scanty oSeringa 6f etocka. but the ef
forU to arouse ary epeculative enthuclum
were Quite futUe, cuttid* of a moderate desaaad
for the iroa tad steel chares, which generally
aev&noed froxa 1 to IK. the latter figure repre
msUec the extreme srala t,y Tennessee Cctl.
The motive cf the movement was the enoour
tÂ£tÂ£4T opinion expressed by the Commercial Re
views of the week ca the conditions In the Iroa
trade. The report ot yellow fever In Florida
c&uaed e&cizress Ir. one or twÂ« Southern rail
road Uses and Brooklyn Rasid Transit wu af
fected by reports cf labor disaffection. Sugar
continued oo its course toward recovery and the
upward movement In Union Pacific was con
tinaed. the other transcontinental railroads
chewing ecrce sympathy. The list yielded on
the bank etatement, but nothink like Impor
tant liquidation was In eridence. The closing
Â¦Â»a* dull and rather heavy, with Bteel Industries
&ru! a few other specialties ehowlsg the cr.'.y
: â¢Â¦ Â¦ l.> net chancel. â¢
Bsjikere estima.te that the demand for gwld to
export on account of the British war loan may
amount to Jrom ten to fifteen million dollars.
The exchange market w&Â» nominal to-day, but
prfr-4 rates wero advanced *Â£c.
The st-jck mark-t has remained In a befogged
condition this week. Changes do not ehow any
new licht on the mooted point of what the fu
ture level of prices for securities Is to be. Un
certainty end waiting are the only deductions
to t*e drawn from the flat, quiet mrfaceof
thÂ«Â» market. Dealing* are on a small ecale and
buyers and nellers far apart. The resulting
duilnes!! cannot be Interpreted aa hopeful for
better conditions to come, but the abeence of
liquidation muttt be accepted as confidence that
Um future will be no worse. The entire ab
reti<?e of any decisive development to affect the
rencral tone of ejaculation. Individual causes
bave had free ncope to affect fpÂ«?cla! stocqs.
Whenever any epedal movement of this kind
t^came evident the room traders rushed to
Join the movement. The re*ult has been that
a half to a third of each day's business has
be?a congested In from three to sir stocks. The
declaration of a 2 per cent dMdend on Union
Pacific was precipitated quite unexpectedly, the
Â»renTjil . . ;-Â»-:â¢Â». <r,n being that action wotMd
be deferred until about the middle of the month.
The ultimate policy of the powers in China, the
cntt of porfermlnK the task before them there
and by whom that rost Is to be borne, ar* Â«tiB
among the inscrutable mysteries. Opinions of
the future cf the money market have wavered
in the Jifht of the !a.rj;e sources for replenish
rr.ent of the New York mariwt revealed. The
Ftrcam of Alaskan gold is beginning to show
Its seasonable eHoct in the country's bank re
serves and the receipt of AastraJi&n gold Is
a<Med to this. Meaatlme, the expected outward
movement of gold is deferred and the policy
of the bank of Hncland leaves the period of Its
,\f ginning an op*n question. Time money has
| fhown a distinctly earier tendency during the
'j*xtcr part cf the week.

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO. Aug. 4. â Yesterday's heavy export
engagements, which last night were placed at
100 loads, were, the sole Influence In wheat trad
ing at the opening, there being no Liverpool
market, on account" of the English holidays.
Opening trades were made at a slight advance,
September at 75*iS75^jc, compared with yester
day* t -closing of 75Vi@ 7 5%a But the market
was not supported. On the contrary, there were
plenty of selling orders, principally by yester
day's buyers, and the market soon broke to
7Â»V6c. Business, which up to that point had
been moderately active, 'then died away almost
entirely and the cessation of the selling pres
sure resulted in another slight advance in Sep
tember to 75?ic, but after the tocal primary re
ceipts had been posted the market again turned
weak and remained dull and heavy to the
close. September closed at 75c
Corn was dull and steady within a moderate
range. September closed M.c higher at 37VÂ»c
Oats were firm all day, closing unchanged at
21">io.
Provisions were lower from the start, and
before the close a material decline had taken
place in pork, while lard and ribs also suffered.-
The market was still under the mild yellow
fever scare. Part of the early decline was re
covered late In the session on buying by pack
ers, who reported a good cash ' demand for
meats. At the close. September pork was 20c
lower, lard 6c lower and ribs 2%c lower.
The leading futures ranged as follows:

WASHINGTON, Aug. 4.â To-day's statement
of the Treasury balances in the general fund,
exclusive of the 5150.000.000 gold reserve in the
division of redemption, shows: Available cash
balance. $143,662.0$!: gold. $72,097,847. .
Condition of the Treasury.
The receipts of cash and the Increase in loans
swell the deposits and the gain of $6,640,800 In
that Item necessitated an addition to the legal
reserve of at least $1,860,000, ea that the excess
cash reported is only $1,678,900 larger than a
weak atro. The banks are adding rapidly to
their circulation, possibly with a view to ship
ments to the Interior later, and tho expansion
for thÂ« past six days was $1.37^.800, making the
total circulation $2G.645.70O. This Is a grain of
$7.776,SOO slpce March 14, when tho new financial
law took effect, but the total is now less than
424 per cent of capital, as against 100 per cent
allowed by law.
The banks now hold $752,765,500 in specie and
legals, which is within $S.O00.WO or $3,000,000 of
the maximum amount ever held, and at the
rate they are gaining it would not be surprising
to see former records closely paralleled. At the
same time the movements In quotations fore
shadow a possible export of gold and the crop
movement will likely reduce New York totals
very shortly.
NEW YORK. Aug. 4.â The New York Finan
cier says: A statement made by the Clearing
house banks for the week ending August 4 is
open to the suspicion that lt does not-reflect
accurately the real condition of the Institutions
at the close of business Saturday. The known
receipts from the Interior and the gains made
by. the banks from the sub-treasury indicated
an expansion of more than $5,000,000 in cash
holdings, but the statement shows an increase

to be made by the Rlsdon Iron Works.
There was some very close bidding for
the job. but the Risdon got the plum. The
Tellus will be laid up for thirty days and
her repairs will cost In the neighborhood
of $20,003.

The Alaska Commercial Company's
Pteamer Rainier arrived from St. Michael
yesterday with sixteen passengers and
half a million In gold dust. It was con
tained In ten large boxes and all came
from the Yukon. At St. Michael all ,the
vessels from Nome were being quaran
tined on account of smallpox. The steam
er Dora, with Louis SIoss Jr., M. L*.
Washburn and Max Hellbronner aboard,
was held up for ten days and a dozen
sailing vessels met the same fate. Among
those who came home on the Rainier
were: C. W. Miller, Bishop Tikon of the
Graeco-Russlan- church and Mr. and Mrs.
B. Jeffrey. The latter gentleman says
that the whole of the Alaskan gold fields
are overdone and the sooner the weedlng
out process begins the better it will be
for all concerned.
The Pacific Mall Company's City of Pe
king arrived from the Orient via Honolulu
early yesterday morning-, but it was near
ly o p. m. before the cabin passengers got
ashore. The vessel was quarantined and
it will be some time to-day before she is
released. There were twenty-two cabin
passengers from China and Japan and
nfty-nine from Honolulu, while there
were 2S1 Chinese and Japanese In the
steerage. All of the steerage passengers
are still In quarantine at Angel Island.

: A legal battle of more than common In
terest to miners is In preparation. Wil
liam Nicholls of Dutch Flat Is the person
directly in Interest, but others are con
cerned in the outcome. Mr. Xicbolls
erected a dam at .a cost of $10,000 to ena
ble him to operate the Polar Star hy
draulic claim and. . has been operating
three seasons. Recently the Superior
; Court in Sutter County enjoined the ope
ration of the claim and the mine is idle.
Mr. Nicholls has engaged two lawyers
to fight the matter in court. W. H. Car-
Hn of Marysvllle and P. F. Tuttle of Au
burn. The dam was erected with the con
sent and approval of the Debris Commis
sion. The validity of . the Caminetti act
may be tested. There is some excitement
among the hydraulic miners. . The Auburn
Herald indicates some heat, for it says:
"There Is no doubt that this injunction
ag-ainst the Polar Star was instigated by
a gang of anti-debris pirates who are out
of a Job, owing to the successful opera
tion of hydraulic claims unddr the pro
visions of the Caminetti act." etc.
Three hydraulic mines have been en
Joined by the Superior Court in Suttei
County during the past year. When tht
nrst case was begun the Debris Commis
sion requested the United States Attorney
Oreneral to instruct concerning: its course.
The answer was returned that as no
; question appeared to be raised concerning
; the validity of the permit Issued by the
commission. It was not expedient for the
commission or for any department of the
Government to intervene in the suit. The
commission has, therefore, taken no ac

income during the year, while many are
fortunate if they net the average wage of
?Â» J? o t okkee P<?r. Ensrineers of established
reputation make much higher charges
There are several engineers in this State
who will not look at a mine for less than
$1000. and many instances can be cited in
which the engineer's fee. exclusive of ex
penses, was as high as $3000. This class of
expert engineer, as a rule, declines to ex
amine anything but developed mines or
make general reports covering large areas
pf mineral territory, which include geo
logical and topographical features, water
supply, engineering possibilities and mat
ters of that kind, which require excep
tional skill and experience. On the other
hand, there are in this city not fewer
than 100 good engineers who will make
examinations of small mines and pros
pects for $100 to $500 and expenses, de
pendent upon the distance from Denver
and other factors mentioned. Large min
ing syndicates usually employ their engi
neers by the year and pay large salaries.
Several Denver men receive $10,000 a year
with the privilege of making outside ex
aminations, and one Colorado man in the
employ of a London syndicate receives an
annual income of about $50,000 as consult
ing engineer for several companies."
A man at Los Angeles has invented an
"electro-geodetic mineral finder." The in
terest attached to this invention is Mr.
Brown's claim that by its use he can lo
cate gold and other metals.
"The instrument," he says, "is a modi
fication of the common form of the
Wheatstone bridge, the modifications ren
dering it capable, of overcoming the Inac
curacies of measurements heretofore
caused by earth currents and abnormal
resistances set up by electrolysis when
battery currents are sent Into the earth
from a metallic electrode."
What else Mr. Brown claims is Indicated
by the following, which will interest min
ing prospectors: "To tell the depth of the
ore body from the surface it is only neces
sary to vary the length of earth measure
ments, as, for example: If a body of ore
was 100 feet beneath the surface 100-foot
measurements over thl3 ore would not In
dicate its presence, for the reason that
the current would have to go down 100
feet to the ore, pass laterally through It
and up through another 100 feet of earth
resistance, thus passing through two ver
tical earth resistances of 100 feet each,
aggregating 200 feet of earth resistance as
against only 100 feet on the surface, in
which case the path of least resistance
would be near the surface. In order to
indicate the presence of this ore body, 100
feet beneath the surface it would be only
necessary to take surveys of a little over
twice the depth, say 220 feet. In this con
dition the two vertical resistances of the
earth, aggregating 200. feet, would be less
than the surface resistance of 220 feet,
and the current, seeking the path of least
resistance, would go down to the ore
pass literally through it and go vertically
up to the other rod; and to locate it it
would be only necessary to take several
parallel or radical measurements of the
same definite length. A measurement tak
en over the ore vein or body would be
low. The other measurements taken of
the same definite length, for comparison,
being removed from and not over the ore
body, would be higher, and It is only nec
essary to shorten up the length of earth
measured to arrive at a point where the
current will leave the ore body and pass
through the crust to approximate the
depth. The variations of the instrument,
being very marked, will show the depth."
