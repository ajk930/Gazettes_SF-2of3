CALL HEADQUARTERS. KANSAS
CITY, Mo., July 3.-While the fight
between conservatives and radicals
over the Democratic platform was in
full swing this afternoon, David B.
Hill, leader of the anti-free silver
force was led into a genuine ambush. He
was defeated through Richard Croker's
efforts for membership on the committee
on resolutions, and former Judge Augus
tus Van Wyck was elected to represent
New York on the committee. Thus CroKer
was told by the Populists and Silver Re
publicans in conference to-day that if ha
would not object to 16 to 1 in the plat
form he would become the New York lead
er in the convention.
Croker also had Elliott Danforth side
tracked as New York's candidate for Vice
President, and John W. Keller, Charities
Commissioner of New York, was selected.
This event is likely to have. a tremendous
effect on the platform fight. It may move
Croker to Settle the financial plank as
Bryan desires it. Until the event oc
curred the fight had shifted and was go
ing against Bryan. ;.K;r
The Democratic party has been In a
very distressing way playing the strange
tragedy of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde all

is to get rid of the malign influence of 15

Speclal Dispatch to The Call
CALL HEADQUARTERS, KANSAS
CITY, July 3.â The proceedings of the Cal
ifornia delegaticn in the caucus at the
Coates House this afternoon were enliv
ened by a most interesting verbal duel be-
tween Mayor James D. Phelan and Dele
gate Edelman. The affair was the talk of
the California delegation to-night, and
both the principals have a rankling mem
ory of to-day's episode. Although each
declares ; to-night that he will ignore tbe
other, It Is by no means certain that they
will not yet come to blows.
- The difficulty arose in this way: Mr.
Phelan proposed that Judge Maguire (Cal

olutions) be instructed to propose and in

plank out of the platform. Mr. Guffrey de
clared that Bryan would be able to dic
tate the platform and name the candidate
for Vice President.
Senator Jones said It was all a tempest
in a teapot anyhow, and it made no differ
ence whether the financial plank was re
affirmed or reiterated.
Governor Stone disappeared from pub
lic view and Mr. Campau had nothing to
say, but there were late conferences last
night and this, morning, and tho storm
against free silver broke loose anew.
It Is the eve of the Fourth of July.
Great preparations have been made to
signalize the day as a sort of Bryan ju
bilee for the celebration of the triumph
of the principles of the Popullstic party.
Patriotic speeches are to be made in the
convention by advocates of 16 to 1. The
whole town Is to be illuminated with red,
white and blue electricity in honor of the
victory predicted by Bryan's friends over
tho sound-money element of the party.
There is to be a parade also in honor of
the event. Just as there Is many a slip
between the cup and the lip. so It Is pos
sible that this celebration of the triumph
of free silver In the convention may be
turned into J the celebration of the
achievement of independence from the
little free silver oligarchy which has
mado pilgrimages to Lincoln and brought
back orders from Bryan that the con
vention must reiterate the fifty-cent dol
lar platform in order to have him as its
candidate.
The feeling is really beginning to per
vade the party that Bryan is overacting
a trifle,
. A statement was sent out to-day cred
ited to Judge Tibbetts of Nebraska, that
Bryan would refuse absolutely to run for
President unless the 16 to 1 plank went

may be forced to yield to the insane im
pulses of its evil side and continue as a
political force In favor of a flfty-ce-it

CALL HEADQt'ARTER?, KANSAS
CITY. July 3.â The storm center Is.
no longer at Lincoln. Nebr. It Is
whirling into Kansas City. The
I':kes X'eak of Democracy, how
ever, still stands in Lincoln, towering pic
turesque and impressive. Bryan is as un.
yielding as Andrew Jackson. He bends
neither to the importunities of old friends
rior the wiles of trust lawyers and subtle
politicians. He turns deaf oars. Jo ent.

Bryan will make no terms with then*.
He will do nothing to conciliate or pla
cate them. No fatted calves Â¦will be killed
for prodigals. They can stick to their
cornhysks or take their chances in the
kitchen at home.
"Lay down your arms or fight" is Mr.
Bryan's ultimatum. This ultimatum has
thrown all political time servers into con
fusion. It is apparent to ail that the win
ning horF<? in the race will not wear blinx
crs, and he insists that his running mate
Fhall zlIpo r.e untrammeled. There is an
â¢undercT-.rront of feeling In several of the
State delegations that may lead to an
anPHBcat on the floor of the convention.

Croker Was Positive
David B. Elm has been unusually active.
No politician tras ever so resourceful and
able to shift his tactics at a moment's
notice. The man who entered the United
States Senate- Loading the attack on
Grover Cleveland's administration and
left it as Cleveland's only Democratic
defender is the ma:, who has nTve and
ability to throw tbÂ« convention into un
known entanglements. All the morning
has Senator Hill been as busy as a bee
in a tar barrel. At one time he locked
himself in his room and sent Colonel Mc-
Ewen and other emissaries on outside
missions. At 2 o'clock, however, he went
to the Midland and was closeted with
Senator Murphy and Richard Croker for
hours. No other leaders were invited to
the consultation.

Tbe fisht was then made In the delega-
If rumor is to be believed, Mr. Croker
was as positive In his attitude as Colonel
Bryan. He signified his wflUngnesi to ac
cept the Bryan platform without reserva
tion The meeting of the New York dele
gation had been called at 3 o'clock. At
the appointed hour its rooms were filled
Â¦with a motley crowd. Cowboys from Ok
lahoma, poker players from Arkansas,
jayhawkers from Kansas, the dilettanti
of" the Texas plains, wagon drivers from
New Mexico and gentlemen from many a
Southern and Western State were there,
awaiting a sight of the Tammany chief
tain and his braves. Curiosity was ram
pant. A few of the New York delegation
strayed into the crowd, but hour after
hour passed and* Mr. Croker came not.
He was still In the throes of the wrangle
with HU!. The fate of the latter in con
vention was at stake. It was apparent
to those outside that he had lost his in
fluence in the delegation. When he was
chosen at the State convention in New
York while Mr. Croker v.as in England
laid up with a broken leg, everybody sup
posed Hill was triumphant. Indeed, his
friends chuckled with delight. They de
clared that he net only had the State
committee by a safe majority, but that
the delegation to the National Conven
tion was a "Â«-nuine Hill delegation.
Whether this was fo or not. it Is certainly
.no longer a Hill delegation. This confer

4 o'clock. Mr. Crokor maintained a firm
position and v.as not* In the least Influ

Their report, however, set a few choice
spirits in the Pennsylvania delegation in
a whirlwind of rage. They were ready for
anything, even to placing a candidate la
the field against Mr. Bryan himself. Il
was with great difficulty that the little
cabal was squelched. The delegation ex
pressed much bitterness toward Mr. , Cro

wishes. They started a story that the

French count. He strokes his auburn
bÂ£ard when talking over the victory and
expresses the utmost confidence in secur

that he had been an old prospector and
bandied the pick and drill In a mountain.
Mnginnis hangs upon his flank watching
every' movement and working like a
beaver in the Daly Interests. There is
trouble in the Pennsylvania delegation.
Former Representatives Howard, Mutch
ler and James Kerr returned from their
pilgrimage to Nebraska this morning.
Like David B. Hill, they had gone up
against the silver stonewall and had come
back with sore heads. Both are young
men and the wounds will undoubtedly
soon heal.
The Clark delegates have, therefore, re
ceived the recognition of the National
Committee a's the regular delegates to the
convention. The fight will now be trans
ferred to the committee on credentials.
The Daly delegates are working tooth and
nail to reverse the decision of the sub
committee, and the struggle waxes fiercer
every hour.
Similar scenes were enacted' at the Bal
timore and other hotels. The headquar
ters of the National Democratic Commit
tee had been shifted from the Baltimore
to the Kansas City Club, two blocks from
the convention ball. It was besieged by
men prominent in national and State af
fairs- seeking tickets of admission and
conferences with Senator Jones and other
members of the committee. Among those
who climbed the stairs was Senator Clark
of Montana. He had triumphed over Mar
cus Daly in the contest before the sub
committee on the previous day. Frank
Campbell was a member of this sub-eom
mltteÂ«, much to the chagrin of Martin
Maginnis and other members of the Daly
faction.

The crowd was still gathered about the
headquarters of the New York delegation
at 4 o'clock. No news had been received
a? to the progress of the negotiations In
the triumvirate upstairs. It '.ha an
nounced, however, that the meeting had
been postponed until S o'clock. The dis
appointed onlookers drifted down the
Â¦stairway into the surging crowd below.
And a surging crowd it was. edging to the
barroom, swirling Into the restaurant, all
sweltering and streaming into the differ
ent entrances to get a breath of fresh air.
John W. Kellar came to New York a
fresh college graduate many years ago.
He was first employed as a Journalist on
Truth, an independent daily newspaper.
While in its service in search for infor
mation in the tenderloin district he was
assaulted l>y ruffians and for a time his
life was in danger. Afterward Mr. Kel

lican daily. He has WTitten for several
papers under the pseudonym of "Cholly
Knickerbocker." Mayor Van Wyck ap
pointed him commissioner of charities and
he La now president of a Democratic club.
He has been a member of Tammany Hall
for a number of years and has always
been a pronounced free silver Democrat.
The friends of Elliot Danfortb were
much chagrined at the result, but Mr.
Sulzer took the announcement with a
smile and said he would gladly give way
to Mr. Kellar.
Hill took his defeat in silence and re
turned to the Coates House with his
friends. He made no definite announce
ment of his intentions. Whether he will
transfer the fight to the floor of the con
vention is not known.
Mr. Hill was proposed as representative
of the delegation In the committee on res

that ran through the crowd like a prairie
fire.
Many men said Bryan ought to have
stepped aside. ' Others declared it was
time to see whether one man who had al
ready been defeated for President was
gi^ater than his party.
Judge Tibbetts is out in another inter
view to-night in which he declares he
"never saw it." There is no doubt, how
ever, that Bryan, in the hope of coercing
the convention, has repeatedly declared
that it must reiterate the financial plank
or go elsewhere than to Nebraska for its
candidate for President.

MAJORITY AGAINST A
16 to 1 DECLARATION
iv" ANSAS CITY, July 3. â I/ats to-night, after quite a careful canvass of the men selected for the corn
fi^k^ mittee on resolutions, it was assorted that there was a majority against making a specific declara
tion for 16 to 1. It was also said that the majority, if such it was, would not press the matter, owing to
>he opposition of Senator Jones. The attitude of Mr. Bryan is thought to be sufficient for Senator Jones,
â¢who is a member of the committee on resolutions, and will be in a position to exert a great deal of influ
ence. Senator Jones, when he first arrived, thought a reafnrmation of the Chicago platform was sufficient.
Notwithstanding the known. views of Mr. Bryan, delegation after delegation has to-day taken a po
sition in favor of the reafnrmation of the Chicago platform and against a specific declaration, yet it is not
probable that the convention will take any other course than to declare explicitly for 16 to 1. It was ex
plained in one delegation which voted for simple reaffirmation that when it was known that this course
was favored by the gold men and the word was passsd around that the proposition was against Bryan,
the delegates would weaken -when the poll was taken and support 16 to 1.

Attributed to the Fact That the Pro

EFFORTS TO CARRY OUT THE WISHES OF BRYAN AT THE CON

yâ^ALL HEADQUARTERS, KANSAS
"I W CITY, V -Mo;'. July 3.â There is a Â«ur-
L prising lack of enthusiasm at* thl3
Democratic convention. It can be
attributed to the fact that It is
known beforehand almost exactly
what will be done by the conventign. We
may not know the exact wording of the
platform, but we understand what it
means. Whoever Is nominated for Vice
President, It will be a good ticket on the
whole and should be satisfactory to all
factions of the party. The action of the
New York delegation resulted in harmony
and good feeling.
August Van Wyck la a wise selection
on our part to represent us on the plat
form committee, because he is in perfect
touch with Democracy throughout the
State. He also understands the geograph
ical requirements of New York. He will
be able to "more entirely represent the
State than any man that could have been
placed on the committee. Norman K.
Mack is also a wise selection for national
committeeman. He had been in touch
with Bryan since 1S96 and thoroughly rep
resents the Democracy of the State of
New York. Another good man Is John
W Kellar. He is the most popular man
in the Democratic organization at large.
As to Deserters.
Any Democrat who deserts the ticket
and platform which will be decided upon
at Kansas City should be summarily dealt
with. If there are differences of opinion
the non-essential fact should cut-no figure
this year.

The* extraordinary'* development of tha

find vigorous expression In our platform.
The spectacle of ten thousand men thrown

people.
The managers appreciate that there
may be many obstacles in the way of
carrying out this programme, but they
are quite determined to find a way to do
It. and they express confidence that the
members of the convention will all lend
a helping hand to this end.
The discussion developed the fact that
Mr. Bryan is expected to be present In
the convention on Thursday, the day after
his nomination, and indicate to the con
vention his acceptance of the honor con
ferred. An Intimation of the convention's
purpose to secure action to-morrow ha*
been conveyed to the prospective candi
date and an invitation extended to him
to visit the convention on Thursday, and
it Is stated on excellent authority that he
has indicated that he will accept.
The members of the committee express
themselves generally as of the opinion
that the programme can be carried out.
and those who know of the invitation to
Mr. Bryan do not hesitate to say that ha
will certainly accept.
The discussion developed some points of
the programme of the committee. It will
have a day and a night session. It is the
purpose to have the usual committees ap
pointed as promptly as possible after the
convention opens, and then have them
get together Immediately, act as soon a?
they can. and. If possible, report and harÂ»
the convention act upon the reports be

the National Committee to have the nom

The desire on the part of the members
to accomplish this end was developed at
the close of the session and it wa3 brought
to the surface by an Invitation to the
committee from the citizens of Kansas
City to take a tallvno ride to-morrow
evening. This invitation was extended by
ex-Governor Stone of Missouri. When,
it was presented Mr. Clayton took Â»tho
floor in opposition to its acceptance, say

general wish that Mr. Bryan should be
placed in nomination on the Fourth of
July, making a fitting Democratic cele

Senator Jones descended from the plat

proposition. All agreed that such a nom

KANSAS CITY, July 3.â With flags
flying, bands playing, streets re
splendent with the blaze of bunt
ing and of myriad lights, and with
the ear assaulted by the deafen
ing conglomeration of bombs and rockets
and crackers and marching clubs and
drum corpsâ with this confusion of patri
otism and politics, Kansas City Is to-night
ushering in th* national holiday and the
Democratic National Convention. There
were crowds here yesterday, but these
were tho advance guard, and to-day they
have arrived en masse, fairly engulfing the
city and taking complete possession of its
streets, hotels and public places. With
this late Influx have come the Tammany
braves, the Chicago marching club and
many kindred organizations with their
bands. And yet, for some reason, many
of tho most ruinous convention organisa
tions, such as tho Duckworth Club of Cin
cinnati, nro not represented here, while
the Jefferson Club of St. Louis and the
Young Men's Louisville Club sent only a
handful of men. instead of their usual
quota of hundreds.
Notable figures of the Democracy have

contingent. Many of Mr. Bryan's towns
men and most devoted adherents arrived
to-night, including the Young Men's Bryan
Club of Lincoln and the Traveling Men's
Bryan Club of Nebraska. This steady
influx is straining the city's accommoda
tions to the utmost, and to-night people
are bMng packed into rooms and hallways
without much regard to comfort so-lonj;
as they can get a place to lay their heads.
The actual business of the day consist
ed in the final selection by the National
Committee of Governor Thomas of Col
orado as temporary chairman of the con
vention and the disposal of all contests,
including the seating of Senator Clark
and his Montana delegation. The choice
of Governor Thomas was something of a
surprise, as the executive committee had
practically decided for Mayor Rose of
Milwaukee: but on a close vote to-day
Governor Thomas was awarded the honor.
The committee also drew up the following
order of business for the convention:
Culling the convention to order by chairman
of National Committee.
Heading of call for convention by the secre
tary of the committee.
Prayer.
Speech of welcome by the Mayor of Kansas
City.

Call of the roll cf States for the names of

Opposing Sixteen to One.
To-day"s session of the monetary league
also attracted some attention, xnainly
throusfh Mr. Towne's speech severely ar
raigning his old associates of the Repub
lican party and declaring: that the record
in Cuba and the Philippines was one of
the most disgraceful pages of American
history.
But far more Interesting than the for
mal business cvf the day has been the
growing intensity of feeling: over the plat
form and the Vice Presidential candidate.
The most remarkable feature of the sit
uation is the sudden shift of sentiment
since yesterday, when the dominating In
fluence of Mr Bryan was everywhere
manifest, whereas to-day many delega
tions took formal action against a specific
H to 1 declaration. wh:ch is supposed to
be Mr. Bryan's sine qua non. The move
ment took form early in the day among
some of the most Influential men of the
party, ret through any sptrit of opposi
tion to Mr. Bryan, but because they be
lieved the overwhelming sense of the dele
pates was favorable to a. simple reafSrma
tion* of the Chicago platform, without a
specific declaration for IS to 1â that Is. a
conservative Instead of a radical financial
platform. As explained by one of these
leaders, a man foremost in the counsels
of the party:
"We nave nothing authoritative before
us showing that Mr. Bryan Insists upon
the 16 to 1 declaration. To be sure>. there
are reports and rumor? and the Nebraska
delegates may or may not represent his
views. The platform committee would
doubtless yield to the expressed wishe*
of Mr. Bryan, but -when the time coraeÂ«
the question will be asked. 'Who says
Mr. Bryan Insists upon this, and show us
the insister.* In all probability It will
not be forthcoming and the platform com
mittee will follow Its own dictates as to
the oroper course to pursue.
"There is no doubt that the personal
conviction of the members of the platform
committee will be for a conservative plat
form â a simple reafiinriatlon of the Chi
cago platform, omitting specific reference
to IS to.l. I have no doubt Mr. Bryan
would accept such a platform If It went
before him as the will cf the convention
The fact Is. we think It rather unjust to
place c Mr. Bryan in the attitude of a dic
tator making demands and we are pro
ceeding on the theory that these so-called
demands are not in reality being made by
him."
Ohio Leads the Opposition.
The force of the movement began to
make itself apparent as the day advanced.
Ohio led off, and after a short fight over
whelmingly instructed its representative
on the platform committee. Judge Chap
man, to work for a simple reafflrmation
of the Chicago platform without a. specific
16 to 1 declaration. This decision was
made in the face of a protest by Tom
Johnson that it was opposed to Bryan's
well-known wishes. The Florida caucus
followed suit soon after by instructing? Its
platform member, Mr. Gibbons, to oppose
a specific plank of 16 to 1. and then work
for a reafflrmation of the Chicago plat
form. At the West Virginia caucus the
same sentiment was manifested, on the
ground it would give a fighting chance
In West Virginia. The Georgia and Rhode
Island delegates expressed a like ten
dency. The Wisconsin delegation in cau
cus discussed similar action, but hpsitat
ed and finally postponed Its determination.
The Michigan delegation also came out
for a simple reafflrmation. And. aside
from these formal proceedings against the
IS to 1 specific declaration. It is under
stood that Pennsylvania, Indiana. Illinois,
part of New York and other Influential
every State represented. It was decided
to continue to advocate the nomination
of Town* ami a committee consisting: of
Vice Chairman Edniinston, Senators Pet

EL S. Greece of Washington, was appoint

MAKES DEFENSE -
OF BRYAN'S POLICY
R, T. Metcalf Says the Man Who
Stands bu His Principles
Is Not a Dictator.
BY R. T. METCALF.
Special Pisrateh to The Call.
CAU. HEADQUARTERS. KANSAS
CITY. July 3.â Mr. Bryan has not
sought to dictate to this convention.
On the question of Vice President
he has not expressed his preference
or Riven tho slightest intimation as
to the man he would prefer even
to the members of the Nebraska del-J
epatlon. He has not Eoujrht to suggest
or name the chairman of the convention
or the officers of the Xational Committee
and in no way has he assumed the roil
of a dictator. The fact that he has In
sisted upon a specific 16 to 1 plank docs
not weaken the force of this claim. When
a man says "My principles are too pre
cious to me to be trimmed for expediency's
sake, my convictions are too thoroughly
grounded to admit of a surrender of fun
damental principles, my determination
that the public shall know exactly where
I stand on the great questions is so strong:
that I cannot in conscience swerve from
that determination." when a man takes
such a position as this he is not a dicta
tor. Rather he is the protector of his own
conscience and in this instance a guardian
cf the record for consistency and firmness
cf purpose that have given to him addi
tional sirer.gfti with each passing year In
spite of the efforts' of many of the gentle
men who now seek to write his platform
for him.
When people, know Mr. Bryan better
they will learn that he Is not a politician
in the popular acceptance of that term,
but Is honestly devoted to his views of
fundamental principles, and that, â¢while
not an obstinate man. on the question of
principles he is firm as a rock. The men
who know him best know him to be a man
of iron. He stands to-day determined
that the platform on which he is to be a
candidate shall contain a plank explicitly
pledging the party to Independent bimet
allism with a ratio of 15 to.l.
Those men of the East who don't know
the man. who may be Inclined to regard
his position on this question as an obstl
nnte one. should know that the same firm
ness of purpose, the same indifference to
appeals, even by meh known to be friend
ly to him. thnt characterizes his adher
ence to the principles in which some of
the men of the Kast believe him' to be
wrong. W 1H sustHin him in the White
House on many great questions on vrhlch
they believe him to be right.
The situation Is an unusual one. as po
litical situations have gone in this coun
try, but the man who is to be the nominee
of this convention Is an exceptional man.
As the prospective nominee of this con
vention he will not surrender his convic
tions. As the nominee of tho Democratic
party in the comtnsr campaign he will not
bÂ« a dodper. In the White House he will
not be a wabblrr. When he shall be elect
ed the men who may be saddened by the
thought that they have a President who
believes in bimetallism at the ratio of 16
to 1 may find consolation In the demon
stration of the fact that also they have a
President who adheres to the policies and
traditions of the republic in preference to
the habits of an empire. He draws his
inspiration from the treat masses of the
people, rather than from the coterie of
trust agents. His purpose is to discharge
his duty so that the result shall be the
greatest good to the greatest number,
rather than surrender to a handful of men
for the privilege of administering govern
ment to the end that many shall bear all
the burdens and few shall enjoy all the
benefits. .

CITY. July 3.â Senator White and

the guests of Mr. O'Rourke, about
three miles In the suburbs. Senator
White was to-day engaged in meeting
prominent party leaders, all of whom con
gratulated him warmly on the prospects
for complete restoration of his health. The
Senator presided over a meeting of Uw
California delegation to-day, and. after
mingling with leading Democrats, retired
at an early hour.
M. F. Tarpey, too. was In demand by
party leaders and he cast, the deciding
vote in the contest between Mnyor Rose
and Governor Thomas of Colorado for the
temporary chairmanship of the conven
tion. Governor Thomas is a close friend
of Tarpey's and the latter worked ener
getically for him to-day.
There was a warm contest for Califor
nia's membership on the national com
mittee. It had been waxing warmer ail
the way from San Francisco, and by the
time the delegates reached here they were
hot partisans for and against rarpey. T. no
vote was close to-day, but Tarpey won
by one vote over Jasper McDonald, after
F'rank Freeman had made attempts to
have McDonald withdraw in the Interest
of harmony. Those voting for Tarpey
were Messrs. White. Foster. Carrnichael
Woods, Freeman. Keya. Del \ alle and
Jastro; those for McDonald were Uenrt,
Phelan. Majrulre, Sweet. Edelman. HiU
yer. Henry and McFadden. Neither or
the contestants voted.
The following were elected to member

vention: Frank Freeman on credentials.
Judge Maguire on resolutions. J. a. hweet

Woods was made an honorary vice presi
dent of the convention and R. F. del \ a!le
was appointed on the committee tÂ»Â» notify
the Presidential and Vice Presidential
nominees.
To-morrow morning 1 the delegation will
march in a body to the convention hall.
As a body the delegates have not deter
mined how they will vote, but when it
became known to-day that the New York
delegation had decided to cast Its vote for
Keller, an obscure Individual who for
merly contributed society news to a yel
low journal over the signature of "CholSy
Knickerbocker." the disgust of the CaP

abandoned their announced intention of
following New York's lead.
Yesterday they were ready to do
Hearst's bidding, apparently, for a ma
jority of the members intimated that a^
New York voted so would they vote; but
"Cholly Knickerbocker" was too much
for them. and. although the delegation

CLARK TRIUMPHANT
OVER DALY FACTION
KANSAS CITT. July 3.â On the evening
before the national Democratic conven
tion the Vice Presidential nomination is
still unsettled. It is a usual expression in
a contest like this, when there are many
candidates and no one has a majority, to
say that it is "anybody's plum." But it
more aptly expresses the sttuatlon to say
that It is nobody's plum.
The chief development of the day ,was
the paralysis to a certain extent of several
booms. The morning opened with great
confidence on the part of friends of Mr.
Towne. The foregone conclusion that 16 to
1 was to be specifically mentioned In the
platform and -the disappointment of
those who advocated a different course
made it look for a time as if Bryan. 16 to
1 and Towne would be the three distinct
features of the Kansas City convention.
The manner in which the Towne boom
seemed to grow aroused those delegates
who want a straight-out Democrat â¢ for
second place, and who object to being ac
cused of swallowing the Populist ticket
and platform.
It was this feeling that turned atten
tion to Elliott Danforth of New York, and
for a time It seemed that the East and
South combined might name the New
Yorker. And while the action of the New
York delegation in defeating Danforth
and putting up Kellar seemed to make
Danf orth's selection improbable, the tide
that set toward Danforth during- the day
served to show that the mass of delegates
was not for Towne.
Another thing that New York has indi
cated pretty surely is that the State does
not want' a 'Vice Presidential candidate â
at least the majority under the control of
Crokerâ for Kellar Is not considered In a
serious light at all. In this same connec
tion it may be said that the Sulzer can
didacy also suffered somewhat as Sulzer

Fourth of Julytv â¢
This afternoon Mr. Bryan met the Jack
sonian Club of Omaha, which stopped
here between trains on its way to Kan
sas City. Seated astride his horse, he
spoke. briefly to the members of the club,
his only significant statement being that
Democrats East, West, North and South
were now united on the Chicago platform.
Mr. and Mrs. Bryan and their daughter
Grace drove to the depot to-day to wit
ness the departure of the Lincoln march
ing clubs and their friends for -Kansas
City. Mr. Bryan boarded a car and at
tempted to make his Way down through
the train, but he had no sooner entered
the door of the first car than all of its oc
cupants were on their feet shouting and
clamoring for a speech. Further than per
sonal remarks and comments with these
nearest to him. Mr. Bryan had nothing to
say. Every car -was decorated with huge
banners bearing the name of the organi
zation'which occupied It. The last coach
was occupied by the Woman's Bryan
Club and on the back of this car was
hung- a huge picture of the candidate him
self.
Mr. Bryan said his Fourth of July pro
gramme was simpleâ that he will stay at
home and hear the news. The telegraph
companies have arranged to provide Mr.
Bryan with details of the convention pro
ceedings. Two telegraph instruments are
in his house, each connected with a wire
that can be switched directly to the con
vention hall, and operators will be pro
vided to remain as long as Mr. Bryan
cares to read bulletins or privately confer
with his friends over the wire.
leave for Kansas City, and a short speech
to the Jacksonian Club of Omaha In front
of the Lincoln Hotel, he spent the day
and evening at his city home arranging
to receive the proceedings of the conven
tion. The photographers of the city took
advantage of the lull and swarmed to the
Bryan home during the day, securing neg
atives of the house and its owner and
members of the family from every con
ceivable point cf vantage. . *
The day's developments, instead of mak
lnsr the situation clearer, simply resulted
peculiar position for an avowed candidate.
Of course, this act is an evidence of the
discipline ot Tammany Hall, but it also
confirms the impression among outside
delegates that Sulzer's candidacy Is not
serious.
Late In the evening, after the action of
the New York delegation became known,
the announcement was made that Illinois
was to place Adlai E. Stevenson In nom
ination and quite a little boom was started
for him by some of the delegates. Among
those who talked earnestly tor Stevenson
vas Henry D. Clayton of Alabama^ who
made the principal speech opposing Towne
In the three-party conference. He said
Stevenson had once been elected, that he
was popular In Illinois, and was a man
for whom the Gold Democrats had once
voted and probably would vote for
again. It also was said that Massachu
setts would vote for George Fred Wil
liams on the early ballot, and that there
was a prospect of a general "favorite
son" movement until the convention
would settle en some one acceptable to a
majority.
Mr. Croker told the three-party confer
ence that he had a candidate and that
he would bring him out during the day.
It was soon known that he reftrred to
Louis Nixon of New York, who was at
one time e constructor in the navy and
is now largely, interested in ship build
ing. It was supposed that Nixon would
be presented during the meeffnp of the
New York delegation, and the K.ellar in
dorsement was a complete surprise. It
Is believed Kellar Is not meant to be
pressed.
The conference of representatives of thÂ»
Democrats, Populists and Silver Repub
licans, held in the middle of the day,
while not advancing the prospects of any
candidate, was not encouraging to the
friends of Towne. who felt after It was
over that they had a hard proposition Ui
face.
.' Another feature of the day was a dele
gation canvass made by friends of Towae.
This was undertaken for the purpose cf
making a show of their strength. The can
vassers found supporters In some, of ;he
delegations and obtained assurances -of
votes, but not in any such number ;.s to
give them very much encouragement. At
the same time. Towne Intends to remain
in the field, and his friends say that as
each and every boom collapses it will be
demonstrated that he is the logical cvji
didate, and the man who should be se
lected. .'-!**Â¥Â«Â«Â«
The declaration of principles, as the
Monetary League calls Its platform, a
summary of which -has been published,
was unanimously adopted and a collec
tion was solicited from the audience to
assist in defraying Incidental expenses.
Ex-Governor St. John obtained the stage
and made a five minutes' emphatic
Mr. Towne reviewed at length the his
tory of the war in Cuba and in the Philip
pines, and asserted that the action of the
present administration in > keeping troops
In Cuba and In carrying on war upon the
people in the Philippines, whom it had
promised to protect, was one of the dis
graceful pages in history. At the conclu
sion of Mr. Towne's address he was hailed
as the next Vice President and received
an ovation on the stage. Â¦ .
Hon. Charles A. Towne was introduced
a3 the next Vice President and received
an ovation. The subject of his address
was, "Some Republican Inconsistencies on
the Money Question." The Republican
party, he said, was the parent of the
greenback, and the greenback had been
done to death In the House, -whereiit was
born. In ' other words, the Republican
party had about-faced on all the issues
which at one time had made it *f* party

was one, ont of the party.

Emperor's decision to send a number of
battleships to China was not lightly
taken, since it means weakening the de

so that they might be massacred by fan

British. French and Russian Ministers
suspected a plot and refused to leave the
legations.
Baron von Ketteler, however, accepted
the invitation and left the German Lega
tion with a small escort of German ma
rines. Opposite the foreign Office he was
assailed by the Chinese soldiery and shot
four times. The Foreign OSice was burn

Special Dispatch to The Call.
*
CALL HEADQUARTERS. WELLINGTON HOTEL. WASHINGTON. July
3.â Formal notification of the attitude of the United States with respect to
China was given by Secretary Hay to-day to the powers of the world. Tha
statement which was cabled to Embassadors and Ministers in European
capitals and !n Japan for submission to their respective Governments em
bodies these points: The United States does not recognize the existence of a state
of war. The United States has not sent troops ami ships to China to make war
upon her; they are sent to look out for Americans and their interests and to
assist the legal Government In establishing and maintaining order. The United
States will withdraw from China when peace is restored. The Importance of
this action in the opinion of well-informed diplomats here cannot be overesti
mated. It seems that the policy which the administration will pursue, contem
plating as It does the maintenance of the Integrity of China, will be followed by
all the Governments Interested In the Far Eastern question. Coming at this mo
ment, when each Government, suspicious cf the other, is endeavoring to frame
a policy best suited to Its interests. It Is regarded as a bold stroke of diplomacy,
and Secretary Hay is given full credit for It.
Reading between the lines the powers of the world will recognize that tha
attitude of the United State? does not permit the dismemberment of China. That
Is an event -which, according 1 to Secretary Hay's views, -would be of vast injury
to American interests. The principle of the "open door" which he succeeded in,
establishing last winter could only be preserved by keeping China intact.

"Want a New Trial.
At a meeting of the Interstate Coursing
Club, held last' night at Pythian Hall, it
was decided to run the John Grace chal
lenge cup stakes in the fall of the year
Instead of In, February, as - heretofore.
Hut this was not all that was done.
By raising the entrance fee from $10 to
$50 and Vmltlng the stake to sixty-four
entries the Hrst steps were taken to se
cure a coursing event unparalleled in the
history of the sport In this country.
This means that .$3300 wlll.be paid into
the treasury toward the stakes which will
run over $(5100. The very best dogs in the
country will be run, although an owner is
'jilted to but one entry. This stake will
bu the richest ever arranged in America
and will compare most favorably with the
great historic Waterloo stake of England.
In order that no time should be lost a
committee was appointed last night to
take subscriptions for nominations and to
report at a special meeting to be called
by the president whenever, the work of
the committee has so far advanced as to
require it.
For the 1900 Futurity stakes there have
been 121 nominations, for which the sec
ond payment has been made. This stake
will be* run' in September. In the near
future the secretary will issue a circular
showing sex, color, age and breeding of
all the nominations. ',..;..

<. 3 AP.LY on the morning of the 3d
j! â 0 signs of the Fourth began to ap
ptar about the city. There was
(<> J the irrepressible small boy with
the r.imble squid and firecracker;
the patriotic merchant with his tri-colored
bur.tir.gr and his tack hammer: the widely
epread and screaming eagle and the old.
familiar shield, with the more familiar
jicture of some one of the country's
founders; the smell of the burning gun
powder, the unending procession of the
prospective patriots to Chinatown for
combustibles, the significant preparations
of the Fire Department, the general holi
day air and here and there a Hag flapping
Joyously in the breezes that so love to
carem it. A!! these told plainly to even
the most indifferent of citizens that an
cther year since the signing of the Decla
laticn of Independence was on the eve of
j Hssir.p away.
The fourth this year has anything for
anybody. There is a parade for the morn
ing, at which the patriotic may cheer and
Ustea to the martial music of the march
ing bands, and shiver in ecstacy as the
â¢hr:!'s chase each ether up and down their
backs. There will be all the military the
State and nation can affordâ which is not
much, to tell the truth, fnr soldiers have
more to do than to parade in these days
of the shattered Monroe doctrine. But
there will be some of the regular soldiers,
and FEilnrs. too. and the local organiza
tions of the National Guard from land and
wn T er.
The Ftartingr of the parade will be an
rcoinced from the tower of the Claus
Frreckels building In a flag salute of
| twenty-one grur.5. Up Market, over Mont-
I gcmery to California, back to Market
i again on Koarny. then to Van Xess ave
| nue and up to Sacramento and down again
Â¦ the parade will make its way, and at the
corner of Van Ness and Post It will be
reviewed by General Shafter. General
Warfield and Captain Glass of the Pensa
cola.
The parade will have all the features,
the civic societies and prominent citizen?
in carriages, without which no Fourth of
July parade would, be complete, and in ad
dition it will have a section devoted to
automobiles. The feature of the auto
mobilp exhibit will be J. M. "VVilkins in his
new rigâ and not because it is Wilkins or
his new riK. but because his is the privi
lege of escorting the Goddess of Libertv,
Miss Jo Helen Marie Pettit. She will ride
with Wilkins at the head of the horseless
carriages.
For the literary thÂ«Â»re will be exercises
In the afternoon in Metropolitan Temple.
There will be music and remarks, an ad
dress to the fiag. a poem and the reading
of the grand old Declaration of Inde
pendence.
For the sport lovers the day will bring
a rich harvest. Sixty-four does will
enter the course at Union Park in one of
the best stakes of the year â the Fourth of
July special. The tennis men will take
their rackets to San Rafael and thus they
will light over the net for championship
honors. At Recreation Park the fans in
the bleachers and rhe twlrlers in the field
will pile up a baseball score befitting the
patriotic character of the day. At Ala
meda molo the yachts will spread their
white wings to the breeze, promised by
the weather -office and will race for a cup
or a flag or even a cheer from the crowd
10:30 A. M.â Parade starts.

When Boss Croker of Tammany was asked on his
arrival home how he had fared during the racing sea
son in England he answered: ''I done good. I had
right wins." It will be seen that Tammany grammar,
like Tammany politics, is satisfied with any old thing

him to Kansas City and left it there as a plank in the

The report that Kaiser William is to send a fleet of

for the death of the German Minister sounds ominous.
Such a movement would start a general rush of the

might become a chaos worse confounded before the

Incandescent Burners to Replace Old
Lamps â Inquiry Into Cost of
Watsr Sources. -
The Supervisors' Public Utilities Com-'
mlttee decided last niRht to recommend
that the old street lamps at present in
use be replaced by incandescent gas burn
ers as fast as possible. The recommend
ation was the result of the consideration
of the bid submitted by the San Fran
cisco Gas Company for the lighting of
public streets. The committee recom
mended that the company be awarded the
contract for gas lamps at 9 cents each
por night, electric lamps at 35 cents in
the business district and 39 3-10 cents in
the outlying sections.
President Crockett stated that his com
pany would take a contract for 44,000 in
candescent gas burners or more if re
quired. Chairman Reed said that the in
candescent burner was an experiment and
if its superiority could be established the
system would be adopted.
The committee decided to take a trip
to Lake Tahoe on Friday. July 20, to in
spect the water supply of that region.
Members of the Board of Supervisors and
Public Works will inspect the system and
will be accompanied by M. Cuvellier. pres
ident oÂ£ the Board of Trustees of Oak
land. John C. Ing, president of the BoarJ
of Trustees of Sacramento. Mayor Clark
of Sacramento and Grove L. Johnson.
The Board of Publ:c Work* was directed
to make a chemical analysis of the five
different sources of the present water
supply of San Francisco with a view to
determining its purity. The investigation
is to be continued until after the wintei
months.
The City Engineer and Board of Public
Works were authorized to ascertain the
technical cost of the construction of the
Spring Valley Water Company's works
now actually in use. The Board of Works
was also requested to investigate the cost
of construction of other available sup
plies submitted to the board.
CHANGES PLANNED IN
LIGHTING OF STREETS
rROM the reception given to Roosevelt in Okla
homa and at every stopping-place along the rail
road through Kansas abundant evidences are
furnished of his extraordinary personal popularity in
the West. Not even in his own State could he find
a more cordial greeting or a more enthusiastic fol
lowing. He is the popular hero -of the time in all
parts of the country, and the academic mugwumps of
the universities and the rough cowboys of the plains
alike delight to do him honor.
The cause of this personal popularity lias been
stated as clearly by one of his political opponents as
by any of his friends. In commenting upon his nomi
nation for the Vice Presidency the Louisville Courier-
Journal said: "lie brings to the ticket just the things
that McKinley cannot give it. He is in every way
McKinley's complement â in age, in temperament, in
record, in influence. He will supply the magnetism
and inspire the ardor necessary to a hurrah campaign.
He will light the torches and wave the flags. But
he will do much more than that. He will
attract a large element of the independent vote, which
thinks for itself, which rebels against boss rule,
which recognizes and admires brains, courage and. in
tcgrity; There is no man in the country who has a
larger following among this class than Roosevelt,
and it is a class which is daily growing stronger and
more assertive in the affairs of government. But
Roosevelt's strength will be even greater 'among the
young men, among the full-blooded Americans of ac
tion and progi^ss, who believe in fighting when fight
ing is necessary, and who, however proudly they may
look back on their country's past, look forward to its
future even more proudly."
The fact that such a tribute is paid to his personal
worth an'd influence by an opponent in politics is it
self an evidence of Roosevelt's ability to attract the
admiration of sincere and true-hearted men of all
classes. Among the crowds that greeted him on his
way to the reunion of the Rough Riders were men and
women representing all the parties known to the va
ried politics of Kansas, and people who agree in noth
ing else agreed in cheering the brilliant young Gov
ernor of New York, who is now by common consent
recognized as the foremost representative of the
young American of our time.

This Chinese afrair will bring up the question of
how far a secular Government is responsible for mis
sionaries i-i a country where their presence is unwel
mine. They do not go as a representative of their
Government. The civil authorities in this country
are not very ready to interfere to protect cither side to
a religious controversy. Suppose that Mormon mis
sionarics should go to China, or elsewhere abroad,
and get treated as they are down South, where they
lire unwelcome? Wha: would the other religious de
nominations say if tlm Government should interfere?
Such an is=ue would test the question. The Mormons
hai c as much right to send missionaries as any other
denomination, and as much right to protection^ But
sll missionaries go abroad on their own responsibility.
Their errand is of necessity in opposition to the Gov
ernment to which they go. Their proselyting iÂ«, in a
targe measure, a process of turning the people against
their own civil and political institutions. This fea
ture of the missionary situation seems but little under
stood. Still it seems that in China it is the cause of
ill the trouble. The German missionaries there ex
?operated and provoked the natives until they attacked
the missionary compound. Â¦ That attack served the
Kaiser as a pretext for the seizure of Kiaochau and
the planting of the imperial eagles on Chinese soil.
]-"or years exasperation of that sort has gone on. and
no reasonable person can expect anything but that
which has happened. The foreigners are not always
wise nor respectful of the rights of the natives, nor
good judges of human nature. They appear without
invitation r.nd remain often regardless of any real
good they do. We are firm in the belief that it will
be better for the morals and peace of the world when
secular Governments have it understood as a principle
that missionaries who 'go abroad on their o.vn re
sponsibility need expect nothing from their Govern
ment. The history of Hawaii and the Philippines has
given a sordid cast to the whole missionary business.
In both arclupelagoes the mission parties have issued
, , . , . - , Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦.Â¦Â¦Â¦ , ,
Horn their soul-saving adventure owners 01 tne land
siid property, and the natives find themselves ex
cluded and aliens in ihcir own country. Missionaries
should let politics and property alone, and if they can
not outwardly respect the civil institutions of a coun
try they should be left to take the consequences. We
arc far from unmindful that these views will be in
tcnsely unpopular among those who have ideas about
the evangelizing of the world. But our reason for
this position is found in such results as are now vis
ible in China, and in the further fact that every coun
try that sends out missionaries needs them far more
p.t home than they are needed abroad. In every citv
in this country are thousands of people as pagan as
any that burn punk before a Joss in far Cathay. There
;tre thousands as needful of medicine, letters, light an-i
leading as any that can be found in the Dark Conti
nent. When a!I of these thousands are taught to turn
their facas to the star?, and keep their faces clean,
Â«M:d when mercy and pity have gone among them to
soothe sorrows, nurse in sickness and comfort in
death, and have let shine into" their darkened lives the
spirit of that message, ''He who hath done it unto the
least of these hath done it unto me," it will be time
to go abroad with the Pentecost.
f* N exhibition of mezzotints and etch
fj ings, by Frank Short, is the principal
\^\ matter of interest in the San Fran-
I cisco art world this week. The ex
* hibition is a rarely interesting one,
and should on no account be neglect
ed by those who appreciate the possibili
ties of thc-s-e fascinating mediums.
To many doubtless the mezzotint etch
ings from a number of Turner's unpub
lished drawings, originally intended for
the "Liber Studiorum," will prove most
interesting. Those drawings, entrusted to
Mr. Short for translation into mezzotint,
as were the hiber Studiorum drawings
placed in Charles, Turner's hands, have
been reproduced by him with nicest sym
pathy and exactest "understanding. With
a fine intuition he has caught the manner
and method of the great artist, and these
are Indeed notable reproductions.
"Stonehenge," a rich, deep, reddish
brown print, is a weird and powerful ef
fect, chiefly in mezzotint. The subject,
the Druidioal circle of Stonehenge, seen
against a brilliant and stormy dawn, with
a tall hay wagon topped by dark figures
for second theme, lends Itself admirably to
the affluent medium. "The Falls of the
Rhine" and "Solway Fishers" are excel
lent illustrations of the felicitous use of
mezzotint with etching, which so distin
guishes the Turner drawings, and the
fo'rmer is also a very characteristic Tur
ner conception, with its opulent ensemble,
almost rude strength and vivid, imagina
tive qualltv.
To turn to Mr. Short's own compositions.
Perhaps that which appeals to the widest
appreciation is "A Wintry Blast in the
Stourbridge Canal," a complete exposition
of the power of pure line to express mo
tion. One can feel the sting of the sharp
rain, the arrows of the wintry wind, as
one looks at the "Stourbridge Canal"â
and hear the howl of -it too. Simple and
obvious in composition, bleak and bare in
detail, it gathers little charm from its
subject matter. It is the masterly free
dom, spontaneity, certainty of its treat
ment that makes the "Stourbridge Canal"
a small chef d'oeuvre.
Of quite different character is the "En
trance to the Mersey," and perhaps more
characteristic of the peculiar charm of
etching. It is an exquisitely delicate im-
I>ression of sea and sky, enchanted archi
tecture ami a shining stretch of wet sand.
It is slightly reminiscent of Lalanne, and
one wonders why. Every line is eloquent
and it is full of runlight and atmosphere.
Again another manner, this time pure
mezzotint, is seen in the "Swiss Pass." an
extraordinary effect of immeasurable dis
tances and vastness on a handful of pa
per. All the soft charm and mystery of
the medium fire taken fullest advantage
ofâ the gradations of tone, the chiaroscuro,
are little hhert of marvelous. In sharp
contrast with the "Swiss Pass," and il
lustrating almost everything that a mez
zotint should not be. is the "Chelsea
Bridge." a commonplace, characterless
composition, which Mr. Short would do
well to recall. Almost equally uninterest
ing is the "Twilight in Campagna," from
a painting by Giovanni Costaâ a common
place translation, except as regards the
sky. of a seemingly commonplace subject.
The "Span of Old Battersea Bridge." a
strong and quaint composition; "Tallant,
CornwaJl," with some adorable lines; "A
Calm," In which is too little said; "King's
Lynn," a lovely study of architecture,
bridge and river, with admirable disposi
tion of the blacks; "Low Tide" and others
make up this most interesting exhibition.
There are also specimens of the work of
Seymour Haydcn. Applan, AVhistler, Le
gros. Creswick, Goft, Corot and other
great ones of the world of the etching
needle, if one asks to see them.

The jury at the Coroner's inquest yes
terday morning on the body of Sidney
Smith, the 12-year-old son of Mr. and Mrs.
Henry Smith of 609 Davis street, rendered
a verdict that "deceased came to his death
through lockjaw, the result of accident
caused by the accidental discharge of a
pistol in his hands."
The boy's mother, Mrs. Letitia. Smith,
pays her son's death was due to the care
less treatment given him at the Harbor
Receiving Hospital by Dr. Harold O. von
der Lieth and she bitterly declares that
her iÂ»oy would be alive to-day if the phy
sician had given him proper attention.
The hoy shot himself In the palm of
the left hand Sunday. June 24, with a
blank cartridge pistol. "With a playmate
he went to the Harbor Receiving Hospi
tal and applied to Dr. von der Lleth to
have the wound dressed. The physician
was busy with other matters and after a
casual examination told the matron. Miss
Brown, to wash the wound and dress it.
She did so and Dr. von der Lieth warned
the boy to go to a physician for further
treatment. The boy was received at the
hospital at 7:20 o'clock in the evening and
was dismissed at 7:40 o'clock.
Last Sunday morning Mrs. Smith
brought her son back to the Receiving
Hospital. Dr. Frank R. Dray was on duty
and he saw at a glance that symptoms o'f
tetanus were present. He operated on the
hand and back beneath the tough palma
fascia, Imbedded in the flesh, he found a
small mass of wadding from the blank
cartridge. He gave the wound the most
thorough attention possible and then with
the consent of the mother he sent the noy
to the City and County Hospital. The
muscles of the jaw and of the back had
already developed the rigidity that comes
from the spread of the tetanus bacilli
and Monday morning the boy died of lock
jaw.
Dr. von der Lleth asserts that he did
all he could be expected to do. but ad
mits that he did not urge upon the boy
particularly the necessity of going to a
physician because he thought from the
hoy's appearance and dress that he would
not do so. Otherwise, he says, he would
have tried to get the case himself, for his
private practice.
"There was no reason." Dr. von der
LÂ»ieth said last eveninp, "to suspect that
there was wadding Imbedded in the flesh.
A probo would not have shown It. and
there was no occasion to cut the hand
open. 'As a matter of fact, the wadding
didn't cause death anyway. It was the
tetanus bacillus, which lurks In the dust
of the street and clsewhpre. Had the
waddins been removed and had the ba
cilli got into the wound afterward the
result would have been the same. I told
the boy to so to a physician, but did not
try to pet the case for my private prac
tice, because from his appearance I did
not think he would bo to any physician."
"I believe my boy would be "alive to
day." Mrs. Smith said, "if the physician
had Riven him proper treatment at firer.
He- went to the hospital hefore I knew
of the accident at all. He came home
with his hand bandaged, and said noth
ing- about its needing a doctor's care. I
kept it bathed and bandaged, and an soon
as he began to suffer I took him to the
hospital again. Dr. Dray gave him the
greatest care, but it was too late. Dr.
von der Lieth not only turned the boy
over to the matron for the wound to be
dressed but he gave me no warning of
any danger. There Is no reason but his
carelessness why my boy is dead."
Dr. von der Lleth Is not now connected
with the Harbor Receiving Hospital, as
when the staff of receiving hospital phy
sicians was cut down from twelve to six
a week ago by drawing: lota he was onÂ©
of the unlucky ones who drew a blank.
He was an appointee of the Democratic
Board of Health and hoped to be rein

BRYAN'S RUNNING MATE.
AS we are now close to the Kansas City conven
tion Colonel Bryan's understudy becomes an
object of interest. The only two booms that
are at this moment audible, visible and tangible are
the property of Towne and Sulzer. Towne has been
a nominee for Vice President ever since the Populist
convention at Sioux Falls. He is a Silver Republi
can-Populist-Democrat. The political child of such
inbreeding, it is no wonder that he runs to polygamy
of nominations. His honeymoon with the Populists
is hardly over before he desires to begin another with
the Democracy. At this writing it seems probable
that he may win. His leading opponent is Congress
man Sulzer of New York. Just what stellar spite,
malign destiny or hard fate should make it possible
for any party to have Sulzer talked of as its candi
date for Vice President no human ken can see. That
it is rough will be admitted by the whole country, and
other countries would not deny it. Indeed, all the
planets in our solar system, as they dance in their end
less ring around the iosv sun, would admit that the
party has got 'em bad that can have Sulzer talke*d oi
in that relation to it. He is one of the members se
lected by Croker to represent New York City, and is
elected by Tammany under orders from the boss.
Some go.od men have been sent to the House by
Tammany, but Sulzcr's name is not in the list. A
man who shows no cultivation in his speech or man
ners, he has not a single qualification fitting him to
represent the metropolis of a hemisphere. He is a
sort of "growler" for the conveyance of the ' drips
of other men's brains to be taken as intellectual
swipes by his admirers.
He and Lentz, of Ohio, have made it their busi
ness during all this Congress to lead in attacks on the
administration. No one objects to that. In all rep
resentative Governments a party in power is made
more cautious and its administration is improved by
attack. But the criticism must have in it a desire for
the public welfare and an element of fact. Neither
has been present* in the attacks made by these two
men. Mr. Sulzer has feigned virtues that are foreign
to him, and has fully realized Shakespeare's descrip
tion of a scurvy politician, pretending to see the
things he does not.
He took up the investigation of the Idaho mining
troubles and sought to make out of them a point
against the President and the Republican party.
This Bowery statesman was in his element in that
work. Being a man without dignity, self-respect,
gentleness or any quality that outfits a gentleman, he
reveled in the opportunity to be as false and crooked
as his nature is. During the hearing of testimony,
instead of acting as the impartial judge he was the
vindictive and vituperative prosecutor.
One sample of'the method pursued by him and
Lentz will suffice as an index to the whole.
When a witness was before the committee Lentz
asked him, "Have you ever heard that the Bunker
Hill and Sullivan mine is controlled by the Standard
Oil trust?"' These men pretend to be lawyers. Ob
serve the form of the question â "Have you ever
heard." A member of the committee objected to the
question as it asked for hearsay testimony. Imme
diately Sulzer turned upon him. shouting "Aha! I
thought so. Trying to protect the trusts! Afraid
to let the truth go before the people! Trying to gag
us, are you?" and so on. This style of examination
was varied by asking witnesses such questions as
this: "What do you think was in his mind when he
heard those rumors?"
After weeks of this sort of thing the Governor of
Idaho, a Bryan Democrat, was called as a witness and
immediately assumed the entire responsibility of the
military occupation of Shoshone County and declared
that the time had not yet come when it was safe to
withdraw the Federal troops. This knocked Sulzer
clear out. The "outrages" on labor and liberty were
all calmly assumed by the sturdy Democratic Gov
ernor.
Still, to fool the country, Sttlzcr hopes to advance
his chances for the Vice Presidential nomination by
putting a plank in the platform denouncing the Re
publican party for sending troops into Idaho to sup
press an insurrection upon call of the Democratic
Governor of the State!
Sulzer is very proper Tammany material, but
American politics has never yet fallen to the depths
of such a nomination. Those who urge it should
have the thanks of Towne, for it serves to make his
own candidacy seem respectable.

him on his way through Kansas is that he was hailed
not as the hero of San Juan Hill, but as the Repub
lican candidate for the Vice Presidency. The people
admire him most not as a dashing Rough Rider, but
as a brave and sagacious statesman. The demand at
every stopping-place was for a political speech. The
people wished to hear him as the outspoken chan>
pion of Republican principles and Republican policies,
and in those places where he spoke of political issues
the enthusiasm of his welcome was greatest.
What he said was brief, but it was to the point. At
Emporia he addressed the people on the issues of the
day, and in conclusion said: "We are going to put
down brigandage and outrage and murder in the Phil
ippines just as sure as fate, barring just one thing â
if the American people choose to go kitti-cornered
next November we will have all the brigandage in the
Philippines that rs possible. But it will stop, because
the election will go straight next November, and we
are going to introduce in the Philippines the kind of
liberty that follows and can only follow orderly ad
ministration of justice â liberty for each man* to lead
his life as he sees best, provided he does not wrong
his fellows. You remember last election you were told
that prosperity would never come to you until you
had 16 to 1. Now prosperity has come to you by the
work of your own hands. If this nation is allowed to
go on as it has for the past thrce'years we shall see
such prosperity in this country as the sun has not
shone on in any nation of the earth before. I appeal
to you for the sake of material prosperity and in the
name of the honor and renown of America â the good
name of the nation."
The closing phrase will serve as a keynote to the
campaignâ "the good name of the nation." To pre
serve that at home and abroad is the charge that rests
upon the people in this contest, and there can be no
doubt as to which paity can be most safely intrusted
with the responsibility. The Republican party is ior
tunate in having a ticket composed of the patriots of
two wars, the statesmen of prosperity â McKinley
and Roosevelt.

hard and deserves great credit for the
creation of her part. It was the picture
of a modest, pure, affectionate and de
voted daughter, who. though overpowered
by love, cannot at the crucial moment for
get her duty. Her early training, tho
recollections of her youth, everything in
her life, her struggles, her emotions, her
tears, her paroxysms of grief are so tru*

of the absurdities of the play while she

passioned utterances.
Zangwill could have made a better play
of his work. For while the novel stirs
our deepest emotions and awakens our
sympathies the costumed figures that
stalk the stage as object lessons onlr
awaken ridicule. As witness the red hair,
whiskers and antics of the poet. Tha
strike parade is not true to life â In ism,
such things were unknown In London
Jewry. In fact at that time the class of
Jew that has been forced Into the play
was an unknown quantity. Little Esther

understood and appreciated the great con

her tiny form? Personally I do not dislika
the Intention underlying the play, that

never be the success his book has been.

A DISCREDITED PROPHET.
IT is the business of statesmen to reason from the
known facts of human nature, from physical and
artificial conditions, and thereon base judgment as
to the future effect of a given policy. Statesmanship
is a mingling of the quality called genius with the
practical elements which make the successful man of
r.ftairs. It is the application of logic, guided by ex
perience, assisted by the rare quality of correct fore
sight.
Judged by these standards of statesmanship Colonel
/Bryan is a failure of the rankest sort. In 1896 he
found business depression and hard times in the coun
try. Manufactures and agriculture alike had been
prostrated side by side since 1893. The only dus:
raised on the roads was shuffled into the air by the
marching of industrial armies, made up of the tens of
thousands of idle men who could be fed no longer in
one locality, and so went crusading toward the capi
tal, living on the country as they went. One city was
glad to get rid of them at the cost of their transpor
tation to the next, in cattle oars, and the city to which
they were sent bristled against the one that sent them
and always threatened some reprisal. So acute was
the situation that fears were felt for the safety of
Washington City, upon which these armies of des
perate men converged, and measures were taken to
protect the public property. The only law found
available to deal with them judicially was one against
going on the grass in the parks and public
grounds.
Such were industrial conditions during Colonel
Bryan's first candidacy, and he took advantage of
them in every possible way. His ways- established
him as a politician, but forever forbade his classifica
tion as a statesman.
"Elect me President," he cried, "and there shall be
no signs up to 'keep oft the grass.' "
He declared that the industrial disturbance was due
to the gold standard, and that if that standard were
adhered to "things would go from bad to worse,"
and he drew a vivid picture of what would happen if
the gold standard were further protected by law.
The gold standard is the law, entrenched there as
never before in our history, and instead of the terrible
things coming to pass which figured in the lurid
prophecies of Colonel Bryan there is general pros
perity and industrial activity. Employers are hunting
for laborers, workmen and artisans of all kinds. The
commerce and wealth of the country have greatly in
creased. The dust of the highways is raised now by
the clattering wheels of activity, and no longer by the
shuffling feet of desperate paupers.
In Bryan's own State the average increase in a
farmer's income, upon equal kind and quantity of
produce, is $500 per annum. In 1896 the total value
of livestock in Nebraska was $45,658,000. Now it is
$102,000,000. Horses have gained in value 60 per
cent, cows and cattle 200 per cent. Sheep are worth
just three times as much. Corn used to be consumed
as fuel in Nebraska, and wheat was fed to hogs. All
this is changed, and on every side there is prosperity.
.The bank deposits have increased over nine millions.
Interest is lower, money is easier to get and debts are
easier to pay.
In other words, everything has turned out just the
opposite of Colonel Bryan's prediction. The gold
standard is more positively in action than ever be
fore, and concurrently Colonel Bryan's own State is
buttered on both sides with an unusual condition of
prosperity.
But Nebraska is not singular in this. The States
around her have felt the Rood effects of the gold
standard, and there is plenty where Colonel Bryan
predicted famine, content where he foretold disorder,
and money is plenty &nd easy to get under conditions
that he said would make it scarce and the interest
high. In Colorado there was probably a more pes
tiferous Bryan sentiment than in any other State.
The demagogues of Colorado were after Bryan's own
heart. But Colorado, instead of suffering, is making
money. On the value of sheep and wool alone she
has cleared an increase of values in one year of
$8,860,000, since Colonel Bryan warned her that
things would go from bad to worse. Iowa has an
average of Â£34 per capita in the savings banks. Thirty
four dollars on interest for every man, woman and
child in a State is almost an ideal condition. The
value of livestock in Iowa has increased $45,000,000.
and the movement of industry there has taken the
place of the torpid inaction which Colonel Bryan said
would go from bad to worse under the gold standard.
Now, a man who has around him, face to face, the
evidence of his utter failure as a statesman, must
have an abnormal gall to put on the market a new iot

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JULY 4, 1900.
Booth Says Mayor's Selection for a
Place Is Not a Good
One.
' The attempt of Mayor Phelan and his
supernumerary. Charles Fay, to force the
appointment of John Finn as stationery
clerk of the Board of Supervisors is meet
ing with violent opposition on the part
of some of the members of the board
This opposition Is especially manifested
by Supervisor Booth, chairman of the
Committee on Printing and Salaries His
opposition Is an Important factor against
Finn, as the recommendation to the full
board must come from that committee
The committee will order all heads of
departments to appear before it and make
affidavits that the stationery asked for is
really needed. The appropriation for the
year Is 124.000 and the contracts will not
ba allowed to so beyond th,at figure -
SUPERVISORS OPPOSE
CLERK'S APPOINTMENT
Lackaye delivered himself of a speech in
which he committed the grievous error of
himself becoming his own critic and In
cidentally defending the author. This
gratuitous defense was neither pleasing
nor aproposâ the public are the judges,
not the actors. Besides. I doubt very
much whether Zangwlll, who Is a per
sonal friend of mine, would appreciate the
epithet snob so graciously bestowed upon
adverse critics of the play by Wilton
I>ackaye. Ho did all he could to save
the play, his rendition of the part of Keb
Shemuel was both dignified and feeling.
He entered into the spirit of the charac
ter with all liis heart and soul and gavs
a sterling and true representation of the
good old man torn by love of his child
and loyalty to his faith as he conceived
it. The old battle that thousands of
Israelites have fought between sentiment,
love, affection, passion and fancied pl*Â»ty
coxild not have been more faithfully de
picted than it was by Wilton J-ackaye.
But even that will not popularize the play.
All through the audience was divided;
some applauded the old way of thinking

State Must Divide Interest and Re

County.
The following self-explanatory circular
was sent yesterday to Auditor Wells by
State Controller Colgan:
I recently submitted to the Attorney General
for his opinion the question ot the -right of the
State to claim and accept the entire proceeds,
tax penalties and Interest, of the State polltax
received undf r redemption. Heretofore Â¦ it has
been the rule to demand the poll of $4 and in
terest thereon at 7 per cent -per annum, to
gether with the redemption penalties thereon.
The Attorney General holds that this posi
tion is not tenable â that the Staf6' Is entitled
only to the poll at $4 and that the Interest and
redemption penalties must be distributed be
tween the State and county in the xarae man
ner as interest and penalties on ad valorem
taxes received under redemption. Therefore,
in future, when a State poll is received under
redemption, you will set aside the $4 polltax
and distribute the balance an above directed.

BOARD OF EXAMINERS
RECOMMENDS RENEWALS
The two great government museums of
art In Paris cannot fail to be of capital In
terest to students of art. The Louvre Is
the most famous of all art' museums in
existence. It represents the accumula
tions of works of art acquired by the
French nation since the reign of Louis
XIV. Prior to his time the building was
used as a palace. It is under the control
of the Minister of Fine Arts and its
merits and defects as a museum are meas
ures of the advantages and disadvantages
derived from the governmental direction
of art collections. On the whole, compar
ing the Louvre and Its history with other
museums and their histories, although
there is much to censure. It !s but fair to
conclude that the official and national
management of the museum possesses dis-
tinct advantages over private manage
ment.
The new Louvre, built to replace the old
palace of Philip Augustus and Charles V,
| was begun In 1541. during the reign of
j Francis I. In 154G the King appointed
j Pierre Lescot architect of the building
Under Henri II and his three successors
the work was carried forward. The Val
ois established their residence In the pal
ace; Henri IV, when fatally wounded, was
brought there to die, and Anne of Aus
tria, during the minority of her son, used
the rooms formerly occupied by Marie de
Medici. Louis XIV considerably en
larged the palace, and It was under his
regime, in 16C5. that the architect Claude
Perrault. a protege of Colbert, designed
I and constructed the admirable colonnade
I fronting on the Seine, a superb facade, 54s
! feet long. Charles Lebrun supervised the
1 installation of the royal cabinet in the
j rooms adjacent to the gallery of Apollo
I in 1681. The museum was officially creat-
I fd by a decree of the National Assembly
I In 1791, and to the many paintings, sculp
i tures and other works of art which had
\ already been accumulated in the palace
I were then added the scattered treasures of
the nation stored In various royal resi
dences, castles and small museums here
and there. From the time of Henri IV
the court painters and sculptors had lived
in the Louvre; the four academies held
their meetings there; the royal printing
office and the royal mint were in the
building; and it is only within the last
hundred years that the uses of the old
palace, so impregnated with historv. have
been converted entirely and by gradual de
grees to those of an art museum pure and
simple.
Vasari describes the origin of the art
collection brought together by Francis I.
Father Dan gives a catalogue of the
paintings in the palace of Fontainebleau
in 1642. The earliest inventory of thÂ»Â»
King's collections (the real nucleus of
the present collection of paintings) goes
hack to 1710. and was made by Bailly.
keeper of the paintings. The master
pieces owned by Jabach and Cardinal Ma
zarin. bought at the sale of the collec
i tion of Charles I of England, were ac
j quired by Colbert for his royal master.
I^ouis XIV. During tho reign of Louis
XVI many priceless works by the Dutch
and Flemish masters were bought for the
royal collection. Louis XVIII found the
Louvre so crowded with pictures that he
had about 3fl<) of them distributed to
churches and other public buildings. Fifty
years later a still more generous division
I was made, the galleries and storerooms
I being more than full. At frequent Inter
! vals since that time the Government has
L taken from the Louvre immense numbers
of pictures of secondary value and has
distributed them among the art museums
of the smaller cities of France, the pal
j aces and municipal buildings, the depart-
I ment buildings, etc. Yet the Louvre con
' tinues to be overcrowded. The building
covers over sixty acres of ground.
There are sixteen departments in the
museum, devoted to the following classes
of works of art: 1. paintings: 2. antique
ceramics: 8, Egyptian antiquities; 4.
Greek and Roman antiquities; s, works of
art of the middle agos and the renais
sance: 6. drawings, cartoons and pastels;
7 antique bronzes: s, ethnographic art;
9. naval museum: 10. Greek and Roman
sculptures; 11, modern sculptures; 12. me-
dieval and renaissance sculptures; 13,
Kgyptian sculptures: 11. Algerian mu
seum; li. museum of Assyrian and Asia
Minor antiquities, and lri. musoum of en
gravings or chalcography. All statistics
with regard to the size of these wonder
ful collections are unsatisfactory and un
trustworthy, for the reason that additions
to the collections are made incessantly
from day to day. Pick up a weekly art
paper published !n Paris and you will find
each week a long list of acquisitions
bought for and given to the Louvre. The
heads of the departments have their
agents all wer Europe, Asia, Africa and
America, everywhere, on the lookout for
works of art, antiquities, treasure trove.
To the ends of the earth the representa
tives of the Louvre are exploring. search-
Ing and collecting â each expert absorbed
in his own specialty, living for it aloi^e. ,
The number of paintings usually on ex
hibition, unless the capacity of the gal
leries has been materially increased of
late. Is approximately 23"A. The collection
of antique ceramics consisted of over
60fi0 objects as long ago as ISSO. The col
lection of drawings and cartoons, from an
Inventory made in 18SSL contained 33.511
works. The collection of antique bronzes
was at the same period composed of more
than 1P0O objects. But the constant
growth of the collections renders all fig
ures inexact and subject to correction.
Popular interest centers largely in ins
picture galleries. The catalogue of paint
ings Is in three volumes, devoted respect
ively to the Italian, the French and the
German-Flemish-Dutch schools. There
are about 6tx> Italian paintings, about TOO
Dutch and Flemish paintings and ahout
900 French painting?. In the Salon Carre

the schools are assembled. llerÂ«* ia thp

Note â This ftudy, by William Howe,
Downes of Boston, will be concluded on
Wednesday next.
The provision of the charter regarding
the appointment of internes to the City
and County Hospital has been violated
by the local Board of Health, which has
used palpable discrimination in making
selections. The charter provision provid
ing for the selection of internes reads as
follows:
The board may appoint such undergraduates
and other internes to the City and County Hos
pital as it may deem necessary. They shall be
appointed after a competitive examination by
the board In any or all branches of medicine
and surgery, and shall receive board and lodg
ing free for their services. They shall be
under the control and direction of the resident
physician, who may remove any of them for
neglect of duty or for other grood and sufficient
cause, subject to an appeal to and final de
cision by said board.
No medical colleges are excluded in this
provision, yet the board recently passed
a resolution dividing the applicants for
Interneship among the medical depart
ment of the University of California.
Cooper Medical College and the College of
Physicians and Surgeons, which are at
j present represented on the visiting staff
of the hospital. It was ordered that the
applicants from the most recent gradu
ates of the colleges who might be recom
mended as eligible by the faculty thereof
and who had successfully passed the
qualifying hut not competitive examina
tion prescribed by the board should be
selected, the limit for each college being
placed at four internes.
No mention is made in the resolution of
at Ipast two other colleges â the Califor
nia Medical College, of which Donald Mc-
Lean. M.D.. is president and dean, and
tho Hahnemann Hospital College, a home-
I opathic institution. Dr. George H. Palmer

, as eligible to appointment, hut it is left
; to the board to say whether or not It is

! to the hospital. Tho board did not deem
j that undergraduates were necessary to
i assist in the wards.
It would seem from reading the charter
paragraph on the subject that the Board
of Health should have designated the
number of internes desired and then held
a general competitive examination, open
to graduates of all the local medical col
leges.

Supervisors Arc ,Po-werless to Amend
the Tax Budget Adopted in June.
Hope for St. Mary's
Park.
N - . â¢Â¦ , Â¦
The officials in the Auditor's office are
of the opinion that the resolution intro
duced by Reed at last Monday's meeting
providing that the $200,000 of excess reve
nue that will result from the increase in
the assessment roll be set apart aa a pub
lic improvement fund is clearly illegal, as
it, is not countenanced by the charter.
The same view was taken at yesterday's
meeting of the Supervisors' Finance Com
mittee.
Chief Deputy William Wells. In the ab
sence of Auditor Wells, who is on a va
cation, states that the tax budget as final
ly adopted by the Board of Supervisors
on the last Monday in June contained no
specific apportionment for public Improve
ments, and that the board is powerless
to apportion any sums in excess of the
estimated revenue for any particular pur
pose without submitting the proposition
to a vote of the people. Wells quotes the
following two provisions of the charter to
substantiate his opinion:
The surplus fund shall consist of the moneys
remaining at the end of any fiscal year in any
other funds, except the common school, library,
park, sinking and interest funds, after all valid
demand?, Indebtedness and liabilities against
said funds incurred within such fiscal year
have been paid; provided that all disputed or
contested claims payable out of such funds
have been finally adjudicated.
The surplus fund shall be used for the pur
poses and in the order following:
In payment of any final judgment against
the city and county:
In liquidation and extinguishment, under
such regulations as the Supervisors may
adopt, of any outstanding funded debt of the
city and county.
To be carried over and apportioned among
the funds and used in the ensuing fiscal year
as part o" the income and revenue thereof.
Again the charter says:
When the Supervisors shall determine that
the public interest requires the construction or
acquisition of any permanent municipal build
ins or improvement the cost of which. In ad
dition to the other expenses of th* city and
county, will exceed the income and revenue
provided for any ene year they must by ordi
nance passed by the affirmative vote of not
less than fourteen members of the board sub
mit a proposition to incur a bonded indebted
ness for such purpose to the electors of the
city and county at a ppeelal election to be
held for that purpose only.
It seems to be apparent that the char
ter does not contemplate the use of any
surplus funds for improvements. It looks
as if the only result of Dodge's increased
taxation will be that the excess taxes
collected thereon will be transferred to
the funds of the next fiscal year to be
used for the expenses of the city govern
ment during that period.
Supervisor Keed has reckoned without
the charter in the presentation of his res
olution. Jt has not been adopted, how
ever, but Â¦was referred to the Finance
Committee for consideration. That body
may realize the mistake as It did that of
levying a tax outside of the dollar limit
for the repayment of protested taxes.
This item was eliminated from the budget
before it was adopted. A similar mistake
was made in a resolution recently pre
sented directing that certain funds should
not be governed by the dollar limit clause.
This was found to be a clear violation
of the charter and the resolution was
withdrawn.
City oifleials say the fact that the
money may not be made available for
improvements sadly needed is to be de
plored, but the fact that tho charter pro
vides for the fixing of the tax levy in
June, before the assessed valuation is
determined, instead of in September, aa
formerly. Is the cause of the trouble. Au
ditor- wells, in preparing his estimated
tax budget, based his figures on an as
sessod valution of $40"}.00O,ono, and allowed
$2iK).000 for public improvements inside of
thf dollar limit. The Supervisors cut the
valuation estimate to $375,000,000 on the
declaration of Assessor Dodge that It
would not be in excess of that sum. The
item for public improvements specified by
the Auditor was eliminated altogether.
At Its meeting yesterday the Supervis
ors' Finance Committee was informed by
Expert Williams that the amount of ex
cess revenue would be only $17.">.00<>. Chair
man Jennings held that the money conld
be used only at the end of this fiscal year
and then onlv to make up a deficiency in
the fund*. Should tho St. Mary's Park
promoters get a favorable decision in the
Supreme Court the money could be re
covered from the city on a judgment.
"Anyhow," said Jennings, significantly,
"we would bettor wait until the city is
actually in possession of the money."

BOSTON. July 3.â There Is little change In
the condition of the wool market here this
week. The amount of new wools cominsr in
thus far has been small, a great decrease com
pared with last year. This, it Is clalmc-d. Is
due to the high priceB asked In, the West, com

Territory wools have been very limited, with
prices ncminal. For fine medium and fine 50@
52c. scoured, would be a fair basis to quote,
with staple wools at C4Q55c. Fleece .wools are
slow, with little wanted at present and prices
are nominal. Quotations:

NEW YORK, July S. â There was an obvious
pfTort this morning to continue the manipu
lation in prices which was eet on foot yes
terday by a clique of professional traders.
The attemrt met with considerable succÂ«ss
for a tim* 1 . assisted as it was by Fpecial in
flu^nr-py aflfctir.g cse or two individual Ftoeks.
There was an active revival of old and neg
lected minors ccr.cming dividend prospects
of a number cf railroads which have been pur-
Fulnsr a Aowmrard course for eome time on ac
count of the general supposition that surplus
cariilr.ps wouM he conserved for future need*,
rather than distributed as Increased dividends
Prominent In this clafs were Baltimore an<l
Ohio and Misaoati Pacific, which were ad
vanced about a point cr over by active bidding
up process during the morning. There was a
continuance of ihe recent unexpected demand
for the Reading and New Jersey Central
Ftorks. the lattf-r rising at one time ten points.
Brooklyn Transit derived seme benefit from
yesterday's verdict in the trial for conspiracy
to discredit the securities of the company. Thf

of th<* Wheat market, which again demon-
Ftrated its dominating power on stocks. When
prices of Whoat were seen to advance rail
road Ftocks turned downward and found no
effective support for the reft of the da.}'. The
prnoral level of prices fell below last night
In the late dfahnp-s, but there were some
Ftocks which rftair^d rmall ret gains, though
much diminished from thos<Â» at this hlch level
of prices. Although the advance was checked,
the rains which were FecurÂ»>d yesterday were
largely encroaehfd upon. The market during
the latter day was dull almost to thÂ»" point
of EtaKnatlon. thrr* being no disposition to
j<ut out fr^F-h contracts en the eve of a holi

The Money market was very dull and not

back to VvicMd closed at SOVic. The feeling
was nnn on the general opinion that the break
on "he recent rain's had culminated. The presi
dent of the Northern Pacific Railroad says that
there will not be more than a quarter of a
crop on the railroad land. The Minneapolis
Miller wired that the reports yesterday morn-
Ing from the Northwest were the worst yet, the
rains havinc done no good and the situation
being worse than a week ago. The leaders
were buying which was considered an Indica
tion of an advance. Duluth receipts were 96
cars. Private cables from Odessa reported
the crop below recent averages.
Local futures advanced In sympathy with
Chicago* but spot quotations were unaltered.

TO SAIL
CHICAGO, July 3.â The longs in 'Wheat
evidently had absorbed some hope dur
ing the night which was apparent when the
market opened. They had in mind the fact
that the market had declined 11 cents from
the opening and hence might be ready for re
action. The main influence at first, however,
was the unexpected steadiness of Liverpool
in the face of the 3%c decline yesterday. The
market showed only a fractional loss, and dur
ing the first trading hours regained some of
that. It was also reported that Liverpool
shipping bids were nearly on a parity with
American price3. August Wheat opened 1 to
: V/iC higher at 78%o@7&Vic and shortly after sold
to 7S%c. On profit-taking August reacted to
"fc^ic, which proved to be the bottom price for
the day. There were more rains In the North
west, but reports from that section in the
last three days said the rains had come too
late. The shorts covered and August rallied
I to SOUgSiVHc. On piont-taking the market
dropped to 79V6@78t4c, tut the close was strong,
August lVs/l 1 /**; up at 79?4Q79V4c.
Ccrn gave an exhibition of strength and ac
tivity which was mainly due to wheat and
hot weather in Kansas and Nebraska. August
I closed li&lVgC higher.

j The "provision market was strong and fairly
active. Hcg receipts were light and consid

still of unsatisfactory proportions and general
character. Without quotable change in prices
the market for pigiron was weaker, closing

copper, after a slow demand, finished quiet on
the basis of $16 50 for lake. Tin, on the other
hand, while still quiet, closed firmer. We quote:
$31 30(g31 45, against $31 yesterday. For lead the
market continued quite as unsettled as hereto
fore, without quotable change, however, clos
ing $4 10@4 15. There was a firmer feeling in
the spelter department, with prices showing a
slight advance and the market closed at $4 Â«%

The brokers' price is $4 40 for lead and for
copper J16 75.

BUTTERâ
The Butter market is slowly working Into
better condition. The demand is Improving
and some sniping orders are coming in.
Stocks have been considerably reduced dur
ing the past day or two. Prices show no ad
vance, however.
Cheese Is rather firm than otherwise, and
some dealers are disposed to advance prices.
The quotations below represent the general
market.
Eggs are steady, and dealers rather look
for improved quotations in a few days. The
market is dragging at present, however, the
demand being very slack and stocks large.

17c per dozen for ranch; Eastern, 14t?14M:C.
Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
The canners are not disposed to do much
immediately around the Fourth and the fall
ing oft in this demand makes the market rath
er duller, though to-morrow things will proba
bly liven up again. Prices for most descrip
tions are rather easy than otherwise.
Sultana Grapes from Indio sold at 75c and
Seedless at $2 per crate.
Cherries will soon bo gone.
Berries are in their usual good supply and
cheap.
An outside canner was in the market after

good prices.

Dried Fruits, Nuts and Raisins.
Apricots are in very good demand and steady,
though quotations show a wider range as the
assortment increases.
It is the general opinion that early Peaches
will open at 5%@Cc. and drop to 5c for August
delivery, though of course this is largely guess
work. None have come in yet.
Dealers are talking 6c for evaporated Apples,
though this, too, is largely guessing.
No intimations of the opening price of Prunes
have yet been heard. The market is now prac
tically cleaned up, and dealers say that it is
well nigh impossible to fill an order for a sin
gle car This has not happened for at least
six years. The feeling is very stiff in this
fruit in consequence of this scarcity.
Honey is in fair demand and unchanged.

disposed to sell, owing to the unfavorable crop

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, July 3.
While being hauled through Hays Can
yon yesterday a thresher and wagon at
tached were overturned. Together with
the four horses attached they rolled
twenty feet Into the creek below the
road. William Beck, the driver, and
Georgo Baker, 12 yars old, who was rid
ing on the machine, were caught in the
wreckage and bady injured. Beck was
pinned under one of his horses and was
hurt Internally.
The boy's right leg was caught by ti.e
tines of a hay fork and pinioned to the
ground. Despite the .severe injury the
youth managed to free himself and run
a mile down the creek for assistance, re
alizing the dangerous predicament of the
driver, who was helplessly caught in the
wreck and was in danger of being kicked
Or crushed to death.
Men responded to the boy'a calls for aid
and hastened to the scene of the accident.
Beck was freed from his perilous posi
tion and Dr. K. B. Smith, who had been
summoned from San Leandro, attended
the Injured teamster. Then the boy's con
dition was noticed and the severe nature
of his wound was disclosed. He had be
come exhausted from loss of blood. The
lad was given proper surgical treatment
and was taken with Beck to his residence
in Castro Valley.
Beck owned the machine and had start
ed only an hour before for work in the
valley. The' outfit was passing over a
narrow portion of the canyon road when
the thresher wheels slipped over the side
of the grade. The machine and the wagon
outfit pitched downward, carrying horses
and nil with them.

OUTFIT ROLLED
DOWN A CANYON
M. Delcasse in accepting the statue said:
"The thought of offering France a statue
of the hero who was the incarnation of
the virtue of his race could not but go
to the heart of this country. But it touched
it more particularly when coming from
the American women who unite per
fect valor with grace. I beg the women
of the Uqited States to accept with my
respectful homage the profound thanks
of the French nation. He whose noble
immobile image has just been unveiled
may perhaps be cited as an example for
the world, but especially to the citizens
of a democracy. I doubt if another could
be found in history who could reunite In
the same degree the equalities demanded
for the guidance of a free people."
The equestrian statue of Washington is
in bronze and about fifteen feet in height
to the head of Washington and twenty
two to twenty-three feet to the point of
the uplifted sword. Washington is rep
resented in full military costume taking
command of the American army at Cam

sword to the services of his country.
The pedestal was designed by Charles
F. Mackin of Mackin, Mace & White and
is of Milford granite and Knoxville mar
ble and is about fifteen feet in height and
classic In treatment. The statue was cast
In bronze In New York by the Henry Bon
nard Bronze Company and the pedestal
was executed in the United States. The
architect Is an American and. the two
sculptors. Daniel C. French, who modeled
the figiire of Washington, and Edward
C. Potty, who made the horse, are both
American. The whole monument, there

BIG STATUE
OF WASHINGTON
IS UNVEILED
A tremendous sensation was created .in
the Mission last night by a report that
gained circulation there that a ferocious
bear was loose in the district and that
nearly all. the available officers of the Sev
enteenth-street station were trying to cap
ture the animal.
The "bear" was, in fact, a large black
dog with no ferociousness whatever In Its
nature. During the night George I'atti
son. notary public, who resides at 416S
Seventeenth street, opened his front door,
intending to step outside. The immense
iioR confronted him. and Mr. Pattlson mis
taking the animal in the dark for a bear
sprang back in fright and slnmmed the
door. The heavy canine walked up and
rfown the porch, and with sociable mo
tives tried to get through one of the win
dows.
Fearing that his castle was about to be
broken Into by a savage beast bent on
rending him into fragments, the notary
sprang ..tremblingly to his telephone and
transmitted his belief to the police sta
tion.
As soon as the exciting report was re
ceived Sergeant Griffiths and six patrol
men piled into a Â¦wagon and a dasti was
made for the address given. Two of the
officers carried Winchesters, another had
a heavy rope and each of the others car
ried an extra revolver.
The armed posse found only the big.
jovial black dog when they flashed the
light of their lanterns on the porch at
No. 41C8.
Thev told the frightened notary the an
imal he had seen was not a bear and pil
ing their weapons, rope and lanterns back
Into the wagon returned to the station.
The officers say the big dog really
looked very much like a bear.

SAVAGE BEAR
Mr. Pattison's Error Creates
Great Excitement in
the Mission.
The ruling also applies to Jockeys Bu
chanan and Ruiz connected with the
Sehreiber Â«taMes.
As a result of this change, Thompson
Bros, were compelled to put lightweight
J. Martin on] the Derby winner, Sidney
Lucas, after having engaged Bullman to
pilot their horse, and many thousands of
dollars of the public's money was prac
tically burnt up through the inability of
little Martin to contend with older and
stronger jockeys having mounts in the
handicap, either at the post or during the
ra.ee.
Mur-h unfavorable criticism was brought
about by Sehreiber claiming the services
of Bullman to ride Fly-by-Night on Sat
urday, after the horse had been ridden
by inferior jockeys and been beaten, when
favorite, by horses far below the class
of those he met In the Oakwood.

Large Export of Alcohol.
During the month of June 419,845 gallons
of alcohol were Imported Into Japan from
the United States, the revenue on which
aggregated JSOO.COO. This large Importation
of the American-made product- was" made
necessary because of the failure of the
potato crop in Germany, which forms the
supply of raw material for. the alcohol
made in that country for manufacturing
purposes. The Japanese want the alcohol
as an ingredient in the manufacture of
smokeless powder. â¢ ', *

EXHIBITION OF DRAWINGS
AT MECHANICS' INSTITUTE
Federal Attorney Coombs and His
Assistants Very Angry Because
of Doctor's Ingratitude for
Their Efforts.
, *
Federal Quarantine Officer Dr. J. J.
Kinyoun came to the Jnited States Cir
cuit Court yesterday morning with two
bondsmen prepared to keop him out of
jail in tho event of an unfavorable deci
sion in the contempt proccedlriga against
him. But. somewhat to his surprise, for
hÂ« appreciated the powerful antipathy of
the people, he was discharged, being duly
and legally purged of contempt. It W8 3
held that the attorneys for the Chinese
had not proved that he had gone outside
the lav.-.
The opinion was delivered by Judge
Morrow and was verbal. United States
District Judge de Haven concurred. A
written opinion will be filed to-morrow
and placed in the archives. The opinion
was couched in cold, calm legal language:
there was not in It even the suggestion of
reproof. It called the attention of the at
torneys for the Chinese to the fact that
the injunction alleged to have been vio
lated by Kinyoun was to relieve the com
plainant nnd others similarly situated
from being restrained and imprisoned
within the limits of the city of San Fran
cisco unless they should consent to be in
oculated with the Haffklne prophylactic.
This lequirement by the defendant was
declared by the court to be Illegal. The
orders and regulations thereafter issued
by Dr. Kinyoun did not come within the
terms df the injunction. The original oa.se
of Wong Wai against the Board of Health
of San Francisco and Dr. Kinyoun did not
go beyond that proposition.
It had been shown, proceeded Judge
Morrow, that tho defendant had sent tele
grams to the Federal quarantine officers
at Eureka and San Diego suggesting pre
cautionary measures against persons com
ing from the infected district. "What those
measures should be he did not suggest.
With reference to the action of the Pa
cific Coast Steamship Company. Dr, Kin
youn simply told Captain Goodall his opin
ion that vessels arriving at Eureka would
be subject to quarantine restrictions by
officers over whom the defendant had no
control. The defendant did not appear to
have imposed as a condition for leaving
San Francisco the procurement of health
certificates on the part of the passengers.
"There has been no evidence tending to
show that Dr. Kinyoun violated the in
junction or that he discriminated against
the Chinese." added the court.
Half an hour after the doctor had
walked out of court there was a warm
time In the office of the United States At
torney. Mr. Coombs and Assistants Wood
worth and Banning Â¦were declaiming
against the ingratitude of their client. It
had just beefi reported to them that Kin
youn had said that the case had been
poorly argued on both sides. The language
in the office grow so hot that Deacon Da
vid Jones opened the transoms to let in
some cool air.
Judge Morrow Said That
the Lawyers Had Failed
to Make a Case.
KINYODH PURGED
OF CONTEMPT BY
CIRCUIT COURT
A complaint charging P. J. Curtin,
"spotter" and private detective, with as
sault to commit murder was sworn to yes
terday evening by Mrs. Catherine Le
Blanche. Lying in bed at the Receiving
Hospital the woman who had been so
dangerously wounded by her insanely
jealous husband affixed her signature to
the document containing the charge
against Curtin, and was sworn by Police
Judge Fritz.
When Le Blanche's case was called in
Judge Conlan's court yesterday morning
the defendant failed to answer. An hour
later his name - was again called, and as
he Btlll failed to appear the Judge issued
a bench warrant for his arrest without
bail and ordered subpenas to be served
upon his sureties, Charles Stunker, gro
cer, O'Farrell and Mason streets, and
John A. Danlell, butcher, 712 Mason street,
to appear in court to-morrow and show
cause why the bonds should, not be de
clared forfeited.
Shortly before noon Le Blanche made
his appearance in court and explained
that he had not appeared before because
of a misunderstanding with his attorney.
The Judge ordered him into custody and
made an order that he 'should not be ad
mitted to ball until It was reported that
his wife was out of danger. Friends made
an effort yesterday afternoon to get Judge
Kritz to accept bonds for his release, but
the Judge refused to interfere with the
order of Judge Conlan.
The action of the police In releasing
Curtin from custody was severely criti
cized yesterday. Mrs. Le Blanche de
clared positively yesterday morning that
Curtin was the man who held her while
her husband sjhot her in the back. "When
they brought Curtin to my bedside yes
terday morning," she said. "I had just
left the operating table and was excited
and nervous. Besides, Curtin did not
have the light overcoat on that he wore
when I was shot. I have been thinking
over the matter since, and I am now posi
tive that Curtin was the man. I thought
he was a roomer, and begged his protec
tion to save me from my husband. He
grabbed me by the left wrist and called
out to my husband. I wrenched my arm
free and struck him on the face. Then I
fell, and he held me down while my hus
band Ehot me in the back. While I was
lying in the hallway Curtin held up my
head and wanted me to send for a priest.
"I saw Curtin once before. He followed
mo to my room in a lodging-house on
Howard and Fourth streets, lie wore a
false mustache and a pair of eyeglasses.
"My husband could not have neld me.
as he was trying to break in the door ot
my room at the time. He did not know
about the window leading onto the porch.
Leon Barnel, the cook, was standing at
the top of the stairs."
The complaint against Curtin was writ
ten out by Warrant Clerk Fitzpatrick
early in the day, but about 4 o'clock Mrs.
Le Blanche sank Into a deep sleep, and
the attending physician would not allow
her to be disturbed.
Captain Seymour holds to the view that
it was Le Blanche and not Curtin who
held Mrs. Le Blanche. Curtin seems to
be under the special protection of the
police. A few days after he distinguished
himself at the trial before the Police
Commissioners of Policemen Murphy.
Bean and Tierney, who were honorably
acquitted, Tierney met him on the street
anil upbraided him for swearing falsely
against him. Curtin wrote a. letter to
Chief Sullivan explaining the circum.
stance, and it was submitted to the Com
missioners, who ordered that Tierney bÂ«
reprimanded for his conduct.
She Positively Declares Now That th9
Private Detective Held Her
While Her "Husband
Used Pistol.
Mrs. Le Blanche Charges Him
With Assault to Com
mit Murder.
WARRANT ISSUED
FOR THE ARREST
OF P. J. CURTIN
The British ship Fingal,- which arrived
from Calcutta yesterday, had a most
eventful passage. She took the long time
of 146 days to get here, and in consequence
10 per cent was paid by the underwriters
to insure their risks. An explosion took
the roof off the amldshlp deckhouse and
killed the carpenter, while one of the
sailors was dangerously Injured. The
boatswain fell from aloft and was Instant
ly killed, while several of the crew were
injured during the only gale encountered
during the voyage. To cap the climax,
the Flngal was placed in quarantine as
soon as she entered port. ;
The Fingal failed from Calcutta with a
cargo of jute and gunnies on February S.
She was expected here early in May, and
because of her non-arrival the price of
grain sacks took- a sudden jump upward.
She met light winds and calms In the
Bay of Bengal, and when the Pacific was
reached there was hardly enough wind
to till the sails.
On April 13 there came a sudden change
of wind. John Sabin, the boatswain, went
aloft with the watch shortening sail. Sa
bin made a misstep and fell from the
main topsail yard to the deck. He fell
on his head and was killed instantly. He
was buried at sea.
On June 15 Carpenter Hanson and one
of the sailors were fixing up some of the
signal rockets that had been damaged.
Suddenly one of the bombs went off and
nearly all of the metal casing was driven
into the carpenter's body. He died sev
eral hours later and was buried at sea.
The sailor was injured also, but not se
riously, and is now around the ship as
usual.
As soon as the Fingal made port Dr.
Kinj-oun ordered her into quarantine and
she will probably remain there for a cou
ple of days.
Captain Atwood Dead.
Captain Charles Atwood of the barken
tino Encore died early yesterday morn
ing. He was taken sick during the trip
from Junln to San Francisco and the
wonder to all aboard was that he lived
eo long. His body was brought ashore
yesterday and the funeral will take place
to-dav. Captain Atwood was well known
on the Pacific Coast and leaves a host
of friends in San Francisco to mourn his
loss.
In connection with the arrival of the
Encore it has been stated that the vessel
put into Montara Point because the mate
and second mate were no navigators and
had lost their way. "The statement was a
libel," said Pilot Alex Swanson yesterday.
"Both men are capable sailors."
A Painter's Fatal Fall.
Water Front Notes.
Joseph Hare died at the Harbor Hospi
tal yesterday mornins from the effects of
an accidental fall at 313 California street.
If are worked for J. "W. Lunny and was
palntlnjr the premises occupied by the
Hartford Insurance Company when the
fatality occurred. "While moving along the
scaffolding he lost his footing and fell to
the pavement, two storio-s below. Officer
Tom Walsh hurried the unforunate painter
to the Harbor Hospital, where he waa
attended by Drs. Putnam and Hopper.
In spite of all that could be done for him
he died a few hours after the accident.
The United States training ship Adams
arrived from Puget Sound ports yester-
Oay. She has now completed her annual
cruise aiid nearly all the boys will be
drafted Into cruisers and battle ships dur
ing the next month. Â£*â¢;:â¢'Â»â¢ 'v'v"
A report was current that there were
cases of smallpox on the steamer Charles
Nelson and that she was in quarantine at
Nome. There was no foundation for the
story. On June 24 the steamer was dis
charging at Nome and expected to bo on
her way back to Seattle two days later.
The river steamers Dauntless and F.
M. Smith and the General McDowell were
in* a mixup in the Clay-street dock yes
terday morning. The Dauntless escaped
without injury, While the Smith had her
fantail damaged, and the McDowell lost
some of her gingerbread work.
A horse and wagon ownod by Wolf &
Ron was run Into by an electric car on.
East atrret, near Washington, late yes
terdav afternoon. The horse was killed,
but the driver escaped.

The second set proved a surprise to all.
as Collier put up a game that, few
thought him capable of. He played Hardy
a vantage set, and was In the lead three
times, only at last to fall. The score of
10-8 tells its own tale. Collier ran to the
net at every opportunity, and won many
points by his cross-court shots. He kept
Hardy on the defensive all the time.
In the seventh game Collier, by run
ning to the net, won a close game. Col
lier also took the eighth game easily by
passing Hardy, making the games four
all. The excitement was now intense and
all eagerly watched Collier, who never
before played In such good form or with
such clever head work.
Hardy took the ninth, a deuce and van

carefully placing his opponent's high loba.
The tenth, another deuce and vantage
game, was won by Collier, making the
games five all.
Interest was now at fever heat, and
many thought Collier would win. as he
was apparently fresh, while Hardy was
not at his best. Collier took th<> lead by

ONCE again Sumner Hardy has won
the all-comers' championship sin
gles tennis tournament, at which
the cleverest racket wtelders of the
coast fight for court honors. On the San
Rafael courts Hardy struggled yesterday
afternoon with XV. B. Collier' Jr. In the
final match of the tournament,- winning
out by a score or 6-0, 10â S, 6â1. This
afternoon Hardy will cross rackets with
Gooree "Whitney for the coast champion
ship. Both men are attuned to the situ
ation and the whizzing balls will tell of a
hot encounter.
Play was called at 3 p. m. yesterrlay for
the finals. Collier won the toss and chose
the shady Fide, while Hardy elected to
serve. The first pame was won by Hardy,
Collier petting but one point. The second,
third, fourth and fifth were repetitions of
the first, as Collier was a bit off his frame.
Hardy took the net at all times and vol
leyed with prreat accuracy. In the sixth
mid last game of the set Collier braced
himself, winning the first three points.
Hardy won the next, three. This made it
deuce, but Hardy won the game, which
gave him the set, 6â0. In this set Hardy

STUDY OF BEDW00DS THEIB MISSION.
XHE objects of this investigation of the redwood (Sequoia sem
pervirens) by the Division of Forestry, United States Depart
ment of Agriculture, are as follows:
1. To find the present marketable stand of the redwood, begin
ning with the counties of Humboldt, Del Norte and Mendocino, to
be covered this year, with the hope of further extending the work
so as to include the whole redwood belt.
2. To study the rate of growth of the redwood, in order to find
its annual production per acre in board feet, thereby determining
the amount which these forests are capable of producing. The an
nual increment of a forest, or the'quantity of wood produced in one
year, represents nothing more nor less titan a percentage upon the
capital which is invested in the forest itself. When this percent
age is so high as to yield a fair interest, then it becomes worth
while to lumber in such a way a= to increase the possibilities of a
second crop. Great attention will also be given to the reproduction
of the redwood on cut over acres. This will entail a thorough
study of its sylvicultural characteristics, its resistance to fire and
especially of the possibilities of, stool shoots and ' root suckers, as
producers of marketable timber. As the tree reproduces so much
more prolifically by suckers than by seed,^tie study of the former
is of the first importance. V , ,
The work of the division among the redwoods involves not
only a scientific study, but is intended above all to hit- upon those
means by which the redwood forests may be maintained to pro
duce a constant supply of timber. It is by' no means! intended to
preach the doctrine of "Woodman, spare that tree,".- nor condemn
local lumbering methods, but to ;â¢ arrive at a system of manage
ment for the redwoods which will Insure to the lumber men steady
employment and a constant supply of timber to the consumer.

There Is no real necessity for a dearth
of water In the Salinas River country in
summertime, according to a report of Pro
fessor C. D. Marx of Stanford University
to the California Water and Forest As
sociation. Professor Marx has been in
the Held investigating concerning the sites
suitable for storage water reservoirs in
that locality, and he finds that they are
numerous. All that will be necessary will
be to provide the reservoirs to hold the
floods of winter, and there will be water
enough to make the land blossom as the
rose all the year around. This report
has not been submitted In writing, but
orally, to the officers of the "Water and
Forest Association, who, while expecting
that the reports of Professor Marx and
other investigators concerning the water
supply of California available for summer
use would be favorable, are naturally de
lighted at the first fruits of the work that
promises such great results to the State
Professor Soule will soon submit a report!
as his work in the country tributary to
the San Joaquin River has advanced to
the point where he can make some defin
ite statements.
, In all directions the field work, con
ducted jointly by the California Water
and Forest Association and. the United
States Government, In this State Is pro
gressing favorably. Several sections are
eager to share In the benefits. The latest
app lcation comes from the people of
TA lllows, who desire to have Stony
Creek s water supply and storage reser
voir sites exploited. They are ready to
put up money, and if an engineer can be
secured they may have their wishes grati
fied. In the last week there has been a
large addition to the membership of the
Water and Forest Association, a practical
canvass having been begun bv H W
Ollmour, who has secured the signatures
of seventy-five new members in a few
days.

ble to create a permanent supply for this

division of forestry of the Department of
Â¦ Mr. Fisher has been for the past month
traveling through the redwood districts of
the State, inspecting their condition. He
was joined yesterday by Mr. Price, and
they will begin their investigations at
once. In their work the gentlemen will
be assisted by twelve men from the va
rious universities of the United States
the majority of will be from
Berkeley and Stanford, as they are on the
field of action and have a certain nrac
tical knowledge that will prove of special
value. The result of the work will deter
mine whether these magnificent monarchs
of the forest, peculiar to California, will
become extinct or whether they will con
tinue to contribute to the wealth of the
State. The object of this work is there
fore not to be confused with that of pre
serving original forests for parks and
other purposes. One is a matter of laud
able sentiment and the other the appli
cation of science to the ends of commerce
"We will begin our labors near Cres
cent City, In Del Norte County," said Mr
Fisher at the Occidental Hotel yesterday
afternoon, "and our efforts are to be de
voted to the study of the growth of the
suckers in the sections that have been de
nuded by the lumbermen and by tires "
