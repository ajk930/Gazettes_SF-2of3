differently.

brother who was commr home from Ban

something terrible occurred. And all thÂ»
time Doloroa was waiting at Mayfield for
bis brother and day after flay hÂ» kept
on waiting, even after the body had been
brought home, because they could not
make h!m understand whose the body
was. Those who tell the story this way

member any brother who was killed and
they aay he was Just made to fit tho
case. "
These BccfTers tell It In their own way.
They also talk of a brother, but other
wise.
The brother was a spendthrift, they
lay. and not only a spendthrift but a
worthless one. He never had norÂ« than
a coin at a time and tkat was usually
begged or borrowed from Doloros. At
last refusals cams at his requests and
then he grew angry.
A barkeeper In San Francisco was a
friend of the brother, and these two pat
their heads together. They knew that
Doloros carried much money In thÂ» easy
way tbat old Callfornlacs did, and so
one night when they knew that 5400

They gave him a drug to drink when hÂ«

woke he was lying in a dark alley and
the money was goes asd so was his rea

over the latest thing in the way of pleated

curled up among the pillows on a couch

Out in the dining-room there was a long:

nnd a row of chairs down the sides. At

women are all supposed to be in bed at

hour and there was tittering going on;
tall, white-clad forms were slipping about
through the halls and more of them were
perched up -on the footralls of the little
white iron beds; stories were being told
and general unrest was manifest. A laugh
a little less subdued, rang out and then
there came the threat of the slipper. The
threat came from the foot of the stairs,
and though it was good natured, it meant
business, so there was a general quieting
down and going to sleep.

o'clock had reached the long- grade known

the Black Kid had taken his stiJion. The

quested to "stand still and keep quiet."
The robber remained standing on the hill,
with the rifle in the hollow of his arm.
He tried to appear careless and indiffer
ent to his surroundings, but I watched
him closely and could see that he was
ever watchful, sometimes standing alert
and silent, like an Indian hunter stalking
bis game. If any member of the party
had possessed a weapon I do not think
that he would have taken a chance at
drawing it, for despite the robber's gen
tle way there was a steely glitter in his
eye that warned us of the danger. I
think it was that eye that did the work.
Had he been on level ground I am not
sure that he would not have had a fight
on his hands, for some of us might have
tried eome wrestling tricks; but his posi
tion on the rising ground gave him such
a grea{ advantage that It would have
been foolhardy to have tempted him.
When I gave him my money he said,
"Pardner, are you sure that is all you
have?" and he gave me a look that made
me ehlver, even if he did smile. It was
that eye again. "I have a letter of credit
here for Â£1030." I said, offering him the
paper. He only laughed and said: -"You
had better keep that. I only need gold in
my business."
After a while he permitted us to walk
about a little, but forced us to keep a
certain alignment and to remain facing
him.
"I say, old chap," Mr. Drake called out:
"don't you know you are keeping us late
for dinner? We'll cive you our word nf
"That's my card, old man. I hope we'll
soon be better acquainted."
He said it to Al Foster, the stage
driver. Then he dashed into the brush to
"avoid a detachment of soldiers who were
charging down the road upon him.
For an hour and a half he had held the
road, holding up four stage coaches and
compelling thirty-one people to deliver up
their valuables, while he laughed and
joked with the entire party. In the face
of the most certain danger from armed
and mounted troops the Black Kid coolly
introduced himself to the stage driver,
with the intimation that he proposed to
remain in the business and would prob
ably halt him again in the road at a" fa
vorable opportunity. .
He. was such a gentlemanly fellow that
I think any one of us would have felt It
bad form to take a shot at him if we had
had the chance. I never before wit
nessed such an exhibition of supreme
nerve and*! cannot but honestly admire
. the scoundrel. He did not insist upon the
regulation "Hands up" after the first
flurry of excitement was over.
Accepting the assurances of the stage
drivers that none of the several parties
were armed he merely demanded that the
men form in a line in front of him and
"pass the hat." The ladles in the second
stage' were even permitted to keep their
Beats in the coach, and it is asserted that
one of them recovered her self-possession
enough to take a covered snapshot at him
with her kodak. â¢
He never for a- moment left the knoll
by the roadside. There he stood in a posi
tion that enabled him to see up and down
the. road for some distance. His rifle was
only leveled as each succeeding coach
rolled before him. His ground had been
selected with excellent judgment at a
snarp turn in the road, where the sand
was deep and the wheeling heavy. The
spot was far from human habitation, in
a country covered with thick brush that
offered ready shelter for a fugitive. How
well the Black Kid knew the country was
proved by the ease with which he eluded
the soldier* when they tried to surround
him.
did not even appear to be surprised when
the detachment of soldiers appeared oa
the scene. It was to be presumed" that
after undergoing such a long strain of
excitement he would become â what do you
say? rattled? at that stage of the game,
but as a matter of fact It was after tha
soldiers were In sight that he gave the
stage driver his card, touched his cap to
the ladies and disappeared.
A wise man has said that a rascal never
laughs. Now the Black Kid laughed
many times and right heartily. Therefore
he cannot be a rascal.
What is he?

Headless Insects Make Their Funeral Toilet
It has of ton born noticed that there are
no animals which are more dainty and
fastidious in their personal habits than
insects, the extreme pains which the com
mon houscfy takes in attending to its
toilet bcir.g a good example of this racial
characteristic. The discovery has now
been made that there are certain insects
which have such a respect for Mrs. G ran
dy and are endowed with such an in
r.atft love of neatness and order that not
eve's death, or rather decapitation, can
prevent them from making one grand fi
nsJ toilet, which is clearly designed to
give thorn a sedate and respectable ap
peaj"am"o after death.
Dr. RalSion. a skilled entomologist, has
discovered this remarkable fact. "Dur
ing one of my recent horseback rides,"
j-i rsys, "I frequently caught cr.e of those
iJr-ge flies which annoy cattle and horses
co raue)Â», and I promptly got rid of It by
crushlEC Its head- One day, instead of
throwing Ihp mutilated insect away, I
placed It on the back of my hand and
Indolently watched It. For some seconds
the insect remained motionless, but then,
to my unbounded surprise, it moved its
front less forward to the place â¢ where
the bead should have bee,n and, after it
had nibbed them nervously together, ap
parently in anguish, it began to brush
its body ar.d to smooth its wings with
its hind legs. Under the gentle pressure
of these limbs the body gradually became"
extended and the extremity curved, while
the wings gradually changed their nat
ural position .and left the upper" part of
the body exposed. Meanwhile the hind
legs continued to brush each other from
time to lime. Maturally I watched this
extraordinary sight with great interest,
and In order to see the finale I took the
insect Into my study, where it lived an
entire day, spending thÂ» time at the un
grateful task of making Its own' funeral
toilet.

-man arid woman in a conventional so

and for too^ir.g the tyranny of man ami

imposed itself. At the moment of sac

the Fame time she. read the imperious

when she was once more beautiful as be

Lea's health Improved, particularly af
ter the second week In September. The
temperature rose and. remained at a gen
uine summer height. Yes. it was reallv
summer, midsummer, at the beginning of
autumn. It was Indicated by the bluish
limpid sea and glowing sky.' the white
and red villas with wide. open windows
and balconies protected by striped awn
ings.- under which gray hairqtl women and
fair young girls in many , colored print
blouses were reading or drinking tea; the
leveled tennis courts where smooth faced
stronÂ£ly built youths and adroit girls hit
the balls backward Â«.nd -â¢ forward = with
methodical agility. Summer was indicat
ed by the concerts upon the crowded pier,
at the end of which one might have been

port In a fnjry paradise of verdure," flow
ers and pnlaces to the sound of Joyous

Every evening, moreover, the .worthy
nurse took her place by Lea's side, watch
ing her and sleeping for a few hours of
light slumber upon a little couch near the
virgin bride. Although Lea's health was
visibly improving, her nights were still
restless and with sudden fits of suffoca
tion, racking coughing: and enfeebling per-
Epiratlon*. Edith having brought Lea back
to Georg, had assumed the task of curing
her, and only then, when her task was
accomplished, would she consider herself
free to embark for Queensland-
After supper, when Ida and Carola had
effered their cheeks for a kiss from all,
they usually remained together In the yel
low <Jra wing-room, the windows open upon
the balcony overlooking the bay. Georg
Â¦would Fit down and play the old mahog
any piano. Tinka and Lea were fond of
muVlc; the professor was not insensible to
It. Tinka would sine Finnish melodies as
In the days of Apple Tree Yard. Some
times Lea. without forcing her voice so
as not to fatigue her lungs and throat,
would hum the melodies with her. Hoedel
would rub his.handB together with silent
satisfaction: nothing but njusic could pre
vent him sleeping after ' meals. Edith
came and â¢went, in complete indifference,
leaving the drawing-room to go and see
if the children were quiet, or to help Liz
zie and the maid in the kitchen, when
the piano became silent, they would talk
peacefully. Georg and Tinka would be
pin* or.e of the grave and simple discus
sions In which they sought to explain to
themselves their own conscience. Hoedel
from, time to time would contribute a"phor-
Isms'drawn from his German mystical
etuuiefc. Edith, upon her side, throwing in
verses of the Scriptures, for- both we're
convinced that reasoning' could be re
placed by rhetoric. These tranquil mo
ments were sweeter to Lea than the trou-'
bled instants she parsed clasped in
Georg's arms" nnd reading a tyrannical
longing in his eyes. The warmth of the
meal gave a fictitious fullness and bril
liancy to her cheeks. She was beautiful
at such moments and she knew It; She
feit that Georg thought her beautiful, and
sometimes she would take his hand and

"I am so happy here!"
The other little girl,- Carola, was
slower, heavier and less amusing, rather
silent and' was somewhat hustled
abqut and dominated over by Ida, her
junior by a year and a half. She showed
a marked preference for her father, who
worshiped her, finding in her a faint re
semWance to himself. In fact, her pretty,
fat, rosy face had his big prominent blue
eyes, and her fair hair, instead of being
short and curly, like that of Tinka and
Ida. was gathered in wavy tresses, prob
ably like Hoedel's in his childhood, to
judge by what he said. "She Is the living
image of what I was at hef age," the
good fellow in the golÂ«t rimmed spectacles
would say. He took hsr with him In his
entomological excursions,' and they could
be seen parsing along the.roads and lanes,
the little one holding the tail of her fath
er's frock coat, while he netted insects
and butterflies. She would theri'help him
to prepare and to fix them in bmxes; and
her clothes, like those of the doeW, gave
out an odor of chemicals and drugs that
irritated Tinka's nerves. '
Edith was absent almost all day long
and took but little share in the' life of
Dartmoor House. She had discovered a
feminist group, tinged with Methodism,
at Torquay and had affiliated herself
with it. &he .only put in "appearance at
meal times. She came in red and quivtr-
Ing with enthusiasm and discussed vast
projects, such as the Idea of going to join
a colony In Queensland, founded upon the
basis of absolute equality of the sexes,
for which colony the group she had Joined
was recruiting adherents. "Kurope." she
declared, "is the land of Gomorrah; the
Just ought to flee from It before the fire
of heaven consumes It."
She intended this curious appellation as
symbolic of regenerated women, the her
alds of the future Eve. The adventures
of Pirnitz in Paris, the union of men in
opposition to the feminist work, had deep
ly impressed her genius. She had derived
the subject of her book from them. And
with the instinctive obstinacy of the nov
elist, haunted by her work, she continu
ally brought around Idea's conversation
t>> this humble tragedv, to the attacks
of Minor au<] Duramberty, Mile. Heur
teau's treachery. Duvecke's marriage and
Germaine's crime. Ivt-a replied to her
questions without repugnance, related all
the incidents, and gave her every detail.
No one could have induced her to utter a
word upon the subject in the hospital on
Commercial road. Her past at that mo
ment filled -er with horror. She attrib
uted all her misery, all her physical de
terioration to It. But now that she was
once more with her. betrothed and had
broken every link that attached her to
Pirnitz. she talked about it almost with
pleasure: just as the memory of his
broken chains became a sort of keen joy
lor an escaped prisoner.
Little lua. curious and restless, was al
most always playing near Tinka. She
was very dear to her mother, in spite of
the tumult that she created around her
work. Often when the young woman was
thinking, her chair pushed back a little
from the table, nibbling at her penholder
with her tiny teeth and her left hand
hanging by her side, a little, fat hand

fresh lips would be pressed on the tip*
of her nngerf. Like an affectionate dog.
the child wou.d sit on the stool for Tinka s
feet and the fair head would nestle on
the maternal bosom." At other times Ida
would gravely establish hersell upon a
chair furnished with a book and pencil.
She would then devote all her efforts to
imitating the attitude and movements of
her' moiner, tracing all sorts of myste
rious hieroglyphics upon the white pages,
and If any one questioned her she replied
that she was "writing a book like
mamma." .

cieurg and Lea cherished this calm and

where so many peaceful and unemotional
existences surrounded their tragic Hie,
and where, without disturbing their at
tention for one another, the faces and ob
jects around them reassured them.
The Mork-y family lived at the top of
the house in an uncomfortable set of
rooms, being relegated there by the lodg
ers, Mrs*. Morley passed her solitary days
there. She was asthmatic and lymphatic

as she had given up hers to Lea, were on
tho second tloor. But Tinka usually re
mained in the yellow drawing room on the

Rock was surrounded by a bluish haze In
the distance.
And every day. in their ' excursions
around tho bay, they perceived . Giider
Rock rising out of the sea like a broken
pyramid, the piace where Get>rg, before
Lea's arrival, took refuge In his moody
solitude and hatred of all sounds and all
living ficesr According to the point from
which they perceived it. -they saw a slops
covered with verdure or a red, bare cliff
indented 'half way up by 3. black, cave.
Lea loved this isolated rock. She sought
it with her eyes the instant', the sea was
before her. She longed to make a pil
grimage to It with Georg as to a sacred
spot where he had thought of her;in de
spair and bitterness. But Bryce advised
them to wait until Lea had quite recov
ered. .The invalid was a poor sailor, and.
no matter how brief might be the little
crossing, a. spasm of the stomach might
provoke a fresh spitting of blood.
They were. now. In .the* last days of sum

have sonic bad weather and then the sun

Georg and' Lea profited from the laÂ«t
fine days ta extend their promenades. It
sometimes happened â¢ that they would
leave after early breakfast and remain
absent until evening, lunching' hi some
little Inn where beer, butter and shell
fish, or a lobster and crabs, were always
to be found. .After lunching Lea would
rest upon a sofa, or. seated in some old

holding her hand, she would fall asleep.

Hampshire Heath and contemplated Lon

voyages and Journeys toward the coun

would seek in one another's eyes tho

the walk and the balmlness of ' tho air
brightened Lea's eyes and color. "No."
Georg would think at such moments, "it

fortune, that Is all." .,

It had conquered Georg. They abandoned
the lanes of the Interior for the pictur

horizon across the bay. They would go

people could have been stowed very com

They went off again as active and cheer
ful as children. While scrambling .down
the path Gcorp explained to Lea that the
old man had fcrmprly been a fisherman
and later hail entered the service of Mr.
Paville the original propricior of (JiUler
Rock. It was lip who had transported all
the building material used, for the. con
struction of the little church, and. more
rrccntly still.' had taken across the few
articles of furniture for Georg's Impro*
vised studio. The boat in which they
were going to row to the Rock belonged
to him. Â¦ â¢ â¢
"Let us make haste!" said Lea.
"Oh the rain won't come before to-mor
row, or perhaps to-nipht. It's too hot.
But If you are only going to the Rock
there's no riyk. You'll have time to see
the storm coming on and to -come back
without getting wet."
They went round Torquay wMthout en
tering the town, along Park Hill road and
Sea road, and reached Babbacombe and
St. Mary's Church, pretty little twin pil
lages upon the plateau to the north over
looking the bay. From this- point they
perceived Gilder Rock, so near that they
could distinguish the wild flowers among
the shrubbery. Georg guided Lea to a
path winding down to* the beach among
the rocks, but before following it ho
rapped at the door of a little ancient, one
storv cottage on the edt?e of the road,
Fiirrbunded by a tiny garden overrun with
fuchsias. A thin man. of tall stature,
white-haired and with h's chin newrly
reddened by the Sunday shave, opened the
door. He spoke in a deep grating voice,
with an impassive air.
"Good day, sir."' he said.
"Good day, Bissie. Is everybody we!l
here?" .
'"Ye?. sIk. -The old woman Is at the ser

you v/c-re no longer to be seen. You have
not be<-n ill. sir?"
"No. Kissie: thanks. Is the boat on trie

"Yes. plr. I went over her this morning
and cleaned her. Do you want the key
of the padlock?" ,
He rummnped in h!s woolen vest and
held out a KÂ«?y. red with sea rust.
"What sort of weather shall we have,
asked Georg.
A livid stripe made Its appearance near
the horizon and slowly bs^adened. The
gulla had returned and were whirling
round in hungry swarms over some ln
<li=tlnct object in the sea about a quarter
ox a mile from Gilder KooK. Georg and
L*-a, with clasped hands, and dazzled by
the sunlight which became more brilliant
a? midday approached, were silent tot a
long time. They were convinced they
were dreaming of the same thing, of their
own lives, of the mysterious fatality that
had brought them togetherâ him from the
Bteppoa of an Arctic region, a country of
flshermen and herdsmen, still close to
primitive simplicity; her from the city
par excellence, the symbol of antiquated
cl%ilixations. Destiny had made them
love each other, leave each other, almost
hate each other, then they had been re
united, still to suffer until the present
moment, In which they, pardoned each t
other. \ -- Â¦
Lea broke the silence and said In a
grave voice:
"I was thinking that at this moment
Plrnitz and Krederique are struggling in
Paris to overcome redoubtable obstacles,
to free women from the authority, pro
tection and love of man. They believe it
to be their duty. I myself bejleved it for
a long time, but now I am convinced that
my duty is to live with you and love
"I love you!" said Georg.
She pos*d her clasped hands against tho
j-oung man's bosom, her eyÂ«rs scrutinizing
htm as though she would Implore from
his Hps the words of truth."
"And yet," she continued, I am haunt
ed'by what Tinka and you said the even-
Ing I arrived. I remember it so well. It
seems to me that when I was with P.rnit*
and Krederique I was right; I did what I
ought to do; and It seems to me to-day,
also, now that I am near you, that I am
acting In conformity with reason and
duty. The two duties, the two truths,
seem to contradict' each, other; and yet X
no longer feel their contradiction awakw
rebellion or haired in me. Tell me. be
loved, you who penetrate so marvelousljr
Into the secret of the conscience, whence
comes the peace that I enjoy now? It is
not because I am Indifferentâ for I love at
once the truth^of yesterday and of to
day." .-'*';' - Â£Â»':- v ; -
Georg was silent for a moment, medi
tating, his eyes fixed upon that livid band
like a slash in the horizon between tho
eky and sea. It was slowly growing larser
and was clouded here and there by a faint
smoky mist. '
â¢â¢"When 1 was far from you. replied
Georg. "I often questioned myself about
these things, and, like you. I am sure that
Frederique, Plrnitz and Edith are doing
good: that Tinka and I were richt when
we left Tramsoe. No! the crowd may
sneer at such absolute ideas, but they are
not erroneous." The necessity of emanci
pating women is not a Utopia. Vv'oman Is
really 'the serf, of man tp-<lay: man is
really the enemy and tyrant of woman.
But -this period of servitude and hostility
will not last forever. Pirnttz's doctrines,
which are good during the period Â«'f rÂ»jn
bat. will then be useless and false. They
will die naturally the day that woman
will have triumphed and secured equality.
Xow it depends upon us to consummate
this future epoch at once, tor ourselves,

should you whom I worship be my enemy .

peace. The sun mounted toward the me

perpendicular rays, so that the l"tj a

5Another very eld school was Madam*
Lemonde's, located in what is now known
as the Silver-street Kindergarten. About
this time Miss Jaynes and Miss P.rlnco.
opened a school for girls on Eddy street,
which they later moved to the now fash
ionable South i'ark quarter. Edith King-,
daughter of Rev. Thomas Starr Kingâ the
father of Unitarianism In this part of the

A little school that is still, remembered
is that of Professor Cairns, on Post street,
where Red lion's. Hall now stancs. .op-.

Somewhere about the beginning of Civil
War times a distinctly smart educational
institute was that of Miss Atkins, late
Mrs.. Lynch, in Benlcia. Miss Atkins was
the cream of school principals, but a
veritable martinet for. discipline. She had
considerable difficulty, therefore. In "keep-
Ing down" the several classes of young
THE young girls of tho present day
know more about public school?
than private institutions. Of roursÂ«
many of them attend private
nchools in town. Korr.e are sent to ncar
l>y boarding schools, and still others go
East. However, the majority of the "new
girls" choose the public school as their
.peat of learning, with the university as
an end to the scholastic foast. Their
mothers, now, thos? 1 whose maternal par
ents lived in California in the days pre
ceding and immediately succeeding the
.Civil War, were with few exceptions edu
cated at private school:'. This was a ne
cessity, not a luxury, then. There were
public schools, but no* many of them,
their curriculum was narrow, and their
advantages few. ..o attain the accom
plishments necessary to win social suc
, cess, the little e-very-day trimmings, so to
speak, our mothers wore sent to private
schools. Many of those, in turn, sent
their children to tho same schools whero
they had received uieir own education.
Probably the oldest San Francisco
schools were Madame Pedabau's French
School, en Geary street, and Mrs. Park
er's, Clay street below Stockton. It was
at the latter school tho Judge sisters
ttended, one of whom afterward
became Mrs. Thornton and one Mrs.
Brooks. Shepherd's schr>pl was at
Stockton and California streets, the
Fouthwest corner opposite Grace Church.
Among the pupils at Shepherd's were Nel
lie Raymond, who married Colonel W.
R. Smedberg; Rose Rabe, Mrs. Shipley;
Lou Rabe, Mrs. Henry Barroilhet; Nan
nie Crittenden, Mrs. R. B. Sanchez; the
elder Abell sisters, Mrs. Bailey and Mrs.
Tripler, andÂ«the prem- Wise sisters, one
of whom married IL M. Bos worth. Mrs.
Bloomer, the aunt of that prominent
educator, Miss Eliza D. Keith, attended
Shepherd's school. It was a very select
school and nearly all of tho pupils later
became well known in the social life of
*n Francisco.

"Girls are given in marriage very young.
The ceremony consists of smearing* the
front part of the bodies of b*.th the bride
and groom with the blood of an ox-killpd
for the occasion. This ox is given by the
groom just as an American would buy a
license. Madagascans do not buy their
wives, though they pay for them when
the women are killed or injured. If a
! man kills his wife her father or his repre
sentative demands thirty oxen and re
ceives them. If he injures her in any way
he must pay fifteen oxen. The^e two pen
alties are about the only protection a t
woman has against her husband's cruelty.
"The parental affection, at least for
those children who are allowed to live, is
beautiful. They treat them as their most
precious possessions. But the one whom
the priest declares is cursed by God is
buried alive or placed on an ant hill as
soon as its fate is decided. The instant a
child Is born a near relative of the family
runs to the priest and acquaints him of
the fact. He reads the starsâ or pretends
toâ and sends back word to the parents
whether the child is favored or hated by
their God. If hated the Infant is killed,
as I describe; If favored, It is allowed to
live and becomes the object of the gTeat
est solicitude.
"Not until six months after its birth Is
the mother allowed to stir out of her hut
or do any work. During that time her hus
band and some of his other wives must
work for her. while she devotes herself to
the care cf the child. Many of the babies
suffer from sore eyes, caused by keeping
them so long in a dusky hut and around
a smoky fire.
"Of course, the women are the slaves of
the men. That is invariably the case In
uncivilized countries. Wives plartt and
gather the 'rice, attend to all household
duties and weave the cloth. This weav

and most interesting operations I have
ever witnessed.
"Among the unenlightened people â I

they are never clothed until after death.
During life they go entirely, naked, except
for grass mats worn around the waists
and strings of beads and charms worn
around their necks and' bodies. But when
they die the bodies are often wrapped
with as many as forty robes, which they
call lambas. These lambas are like a
sheet and are woven by the women and
laid aside to be used as winding sheets.
The richer a man Is the more lambas ho
has. They are of both silk and cotton.
The silk may be any color. But you must
not imagine that these lambas are used
when a woman dies. Qh. no; they are
not wasted on women. Only the men are
buried in cloth wrappings, but the women
take great pride In making them

women under her care. But she permitted
her charges to enjoy a certain amount of
recreation. For instance, at the weekly
receptions given at the school the young
army officers at the Benicia barracks were
invited, and this was", of course, a treat
to the schoolgirls. Gold lace Is ever at
tractive. More than one of "Miss Atkins'

weekly soirees.

What a Cloudburst RealLy
"The most destructive form of mountain
storm is the so-called cloudburst, Â¦when,
the rippling brook suddenly becomes a
roaring river, carrying death and destruc
tion in its path. The noise made by a
cloudburst has no parallel. Above the
rumble and roar of a mass of rushing
water is heard a grinding, groaninc sound
of falling trees, of slipping earth and roll
ing boulders, while the banks of the
stream far above the danger line tremble
as If in an earthquake. The senses are
numbed by the awful cataclysm, and it
seems to the spectator, although he is on
the high banks and out of actual danger,
as if the very foundations of the earth
had burst and judgment day was come.
The flood tosses about mighty trees and
rocks as if they were straws, the banks
of the stream seem to dissolve before his
eyes, and a feeling of awe at the Irresist
ible power of nature steals over the ob
server. Once witnessed, a cloudburst is
never forgotten.
"In point of fact, however,, there is no
such thing as the bursting of a cloud. The
term "cloudburst' is a convenient expres
sion by which the result of a very heavy
rain is designated. Nearly all the surface
of the ejirth in the mountain region Is
made up either of rocks or adobe soil.
The latter, in most cases, has never been
broken to cultivation, and is almost im
pervious to a sudden heavy downpour of
rain. The consequence is thaÂ£ the moun
tains are cut up with arroyos, gullies and
water courses, and In the course of un
numbered ages Into mighty canyons which
astound the tourist.
"In an unusually heavy rainfall the great
mass of water spread over a large area
instead of sinking into the ground Is
quickly accumulated in the beds of the
streams, which rise many feet in a short
time." When this accumulation is rapid
enough and the 'lay of the land' Is just
ri?ht the water rushes down the bed of
the stream in a solid wall and is called u
cloudburst. The same precipitation in an
open country, or in one in which the soil
has been broken up by cultivation, would
be called a heavy rainfall, and would do
no damage unless continued long enough
lor the streams 1 to rise out of their banks
and flood the country.
"One of the most destructive storms of
this nature, so far as its manifold conse
quences are concerned, took place in the
spring of 1864, when a cloudburst occurred
at the headwaters of Cherry Creok. This
is a small stream, dry most of the year,
but notorious for its eccentricities. Â¦ It
flows through Denver and empties into the
Platte River, within the confines of the
city. Just at nightfall the water swept
down this dry creek in a wall said to have
been ten feet in height, carrying every
thing before it. Many people were
drowned and many buildings were washed
away. All night long the creek flowed
bankful of water that was thick with
wreckage. People were rescued during
the night or. rafts and improvised boats.
The most serious loss, was the city hall,
which was swept away by the water, to
gether with all the records on file there.
These records included not only those of
the State and city, but also the United
States land filings."â T. C. Knowles, in
Ainslee's Magazine.

the Hemme girls were Clark scholars.
Mrs. John E. de Ruyter, then Leslie Van
Ness, was a graduate of the institute.
Mills Seminary, founded by Dr. and Mrs.

school, attended by pupils coming from all
over the State. The youngest sister of Mrs.
John F. Swift and Mrs. Charles Torbert
(Maria Woods) went to Mills'; also Mattie
Carpenter (Mrs. Vincent) was one of the
early pupils, and Mrs. Isaac Morse, then
Mary Tourtelotte. Nellie Spencer, who
married the clever lawyer, Dennis Spen

remembered as a star pupil. Others
who counted it among: their most precious
privileges to be a "Mills" girl were Jean

of Frank Unger, and now the wife of
Arthur Jules Goodman, ihe artist, went
to Mills.
Among the younger pupils was Min

"The Colombian aod Venezuelan
Republics."
The late Envoy Extraordinary and Min
ister Plenipotentiary of the United States
to .Colombia and Venezuela, "William L.
Scruggs, is the author of a most valuable
work entitled, "The Colombian and Vene
zuelan Republics" â a book devoted to a
study of these countries and their people
and containing many notes on other parts
of Central and South America. In his
official capacity the author was afforded
exceptional opportunities for compiling
the data which he presents in his book,
and' from his twenty-five> years spent In
these countries he should certainly be
well qualified to speak understanding^ of
their climatic conditions; man^y of the
places which have been considered un
healthy by those who are ignorant of the
facts he finds the reverse. The magnifi
cent mountain scenery of the Magdalena
Valley and the gorgeous tropical scenery
and luxuriant vegetable life are described
at length. The great difficulties of trans
portation are dwelt upon, and he polnt3
out the need of better conditions, which
would lead to the development of the
magnificent resources of the countries.
The volume contains chapters on the
agricultural products of Venezuela, on
the Guayana boundary question, the Isth
mus of Panama, and Panama Canal pro
jects, the rights and duties of foreign res
idents In South America, the Monroe doc
trine, the Venezuelan arbitration award
of 1899, etc. The book should be invalu
able to a person intending to travel or
settle in South or Central America, for It
contains much practical advice upon the
best methods of dealing with the native
population and the best parts of the coun
try in which to settle. (Published by Lit

J (lustrations from William.
'Â£. Scruggs' <Â£atest Book.
Entitled, "Jhe Colombian
and Venezuelan Republics."
SyF^OURTEEN' years ago William T.
p^ Stead witnessed the performance of
k the "Passion Play" at Oberammer
gau and after securing from various
Eources the best text extant he has done
the drama over into narrative form under
the title of "The Crucifixion." Mr. Stead's
wnrk on the play is all that could be de
sired and will find many interested read
ers. He ha? translated from the German
into English and written the story in
a clear and concise stylo most appropriate
to the subject. The play is in nine acts
and takes some eipht hours for rendition.
It opens with Jesus in the Temple driving
out the money-changers and clones with,
the Savior on the cross on Calvary â the
last week of Christ's life on earth. The
story is mn.de most powerful through its
f-iit^'le and direct telling. Mr. Stead has
kept closely to the text of the play and
given us the dialogue In 5tory form with
out descriptions or remarks upon his -own
part. As he explains In the introduction:
"In this narrative I am merely a reporter.
3 put down exactly as 1 saw it happen
all that took place. I record the very
words and expressions, doing them into
Ensrli.-h from the German which I heard."
His explanation of why he has written
the book and why he deems himself qual
si'cl for the writing is certainly inter
esting:' Â« . "â¢â¢- :^
â¢I have only two qualifications for writ
ir.R this story. 1 have been in jail and I
have se. n the events which I describe
with my own eyes. To most men the
prsfibility of the supreme majesty of the

though In the abstract conceivable. Is
practically unrealizable.
"They have never been the man In the

"And until on? ha? been the man in the

Etand how he fÂ«K's.
"But whoever has stood In the position
of the accused ar.d who has seen the
whole machinery Â°f human justice set

gains an insight into the other side of

"This is true when the man in the box
is justly accused and justly condemned.
"it is mi.'fh more tr;:e when the offense
for which sentence was passed was an in
advrrw-rt technical breach Â«jf the law
with the express purpose of Improving tbe
law so as to save those who would other
wise have perished.
Â¦'It is fourteen ye^ra since I stood In
that position, under circumstances which
at that time attracted the attention of
Jh*Â» world and tl'e memory of that ex
pexieoce will never leave me. It has been
a key to the understanding: of much in
the way in which Jrsus was tried in Jeru-
Ealem whW-h will enable me some day. 1
hope, to tell the story in my own w#y.
But for that the time. has not yet oomc."'
Mr^ Stead closes hi.? translation 1 with a
most valuable conclusionâ valuable, inas
much as it pives us nis personal impres-
Fions of the way in which he was affected
by witnessing the production of the "Pas
sion Play." "the story that transformed
the world." In it Is the sympathetic and
honest repression of a nature able to
appreciate and understand the beautiful
story of Christ's life ar.d better still able
to impart to others thiough his pen the
emotions ho himself has felt, in witnoss
!nE this greatest of ail dramas. The con
clusion should be read before the play.
It cannot help but inspire the reader and
place him mentally in a position the bet
ter to understand and appreciate the text.
The publication of the book at this time
Is most appropriate, for this ia the year of
the decennial representation of the "Pas
sion Play" at Oberammergau. (Published
by Davis & Co.. Chicago.)
_:
C7he Passion Play.
Naturally, published reports of the
rerformar.ee of the "Passion Play" by
the peasants of Oberammergau are much
more numerous this year than they were
fn years ago. when the last representa
tions of the sacred drama were given. The
number of newspaj>ers has greatly multi
plied in the interval, and so have methods
cf reporting. But most of the accounts
that have been printed have been com
posed of two parts, the first iterating the
history of the peasants' performances,
their origin and development, the other
comprising a mere Impression of the play
from which one can learn how it moved
the writer, but does not derive a very
clear account of its action.
Th*> most important and interesting fact
to be learned from the Oberammeryau
letters and dispatches this year is that
the great festival has not been vulgarized,
as some sensitive folks feared It would
be. by its great popularity. Its influence
asÂ» a rr ligious ceremony s^eems to be as
potent as ever. Â» Necessarily the event
takes on a commercial aspect nowadays.
Thousands cf persons from all over the
civilized world must he transported to
snd from the Tyrolean village; they must
r*Â» cared for while they are there. To
meet the requii ements of the hour some
their heads. The hair of the girls streams
down their backs, and the men have wav
ing locks and beards. The chorus singa
all day ushering in the seventeen parts of
the play, and sinpiner the accompaniment
to the t;Â».b!eaus taken from the Old Testar
ment. all of which are supposed to have
some affinity to the different acts of the
drama. The music which accompanies
th" singing is nearly us old as the play,
The tirst picture shown is Adam and
EVe, driven out of Paradise by an angel
with a flaming .sword. While the chorus
deplores the loss of Paradise*, a second
tableau shows the cross, before which the
aiiRt-ls bow In reverence, ami which Is to
bring back happiness to earth.
Then the chorus withdraws and the en
try of Christ into Jerusalem takes place.
More than 000 actors make up the crowd
which precedes and surrounds him, crying
"Hosannah"' and waving palm branches.
Kxeltoment becomes very great when the
new Christ becomes visible. Very tall,
lithe and upright, with regular features
of a fnefined cast, a fair beard and long,
glossy brown locks, ho looked. In his pale
lilac robe and crimson mantle, the per
sonification of the pictures we see of
Christ in all the famous galleries of the
world. He is a blending of Lucas Cran
ach's and Leonardo da Vinci's version of
the ideal Character. It is a trying part,
and simple hearts do not perhaps ask
more than beauty and grace of manner
in the scene oh the Oberammergau Mount
of Olives.
There was much crying among the audi
ence, and during the Pat^ion scene sobs
were so. loud that they almost disturbed
the acting. While ChrJ,et advances to the
front of the stage the scene in the Temple
is changed, and when he turns back he
finds the building filled with money lend
ers and dove venders, whom he upbraids
and drives out, striking about him with
a rope, taken from one near him.
We are next shown the Jewish Council.
Caiaphas is- in white and gold robes. Old
Annas and his councilors all agree that
the laws of Moses are threatened by this
Galilean, who has the people on his side.
This scene was preceded by a tableau
showing the brothers of Joseph trading
the father's favorite away to merchant?
parsing by. Of the new actors in the
council scene the most successful ij
Caiaphas, a man of fine presence, com
manding in speech and manner, in whom
it is impossible to recognize the sexton of
the village.
There is also much dramatic power in
the scenes that follow Christ's taking
leave of Bethany. He spends a day with
his disciples, gives them precious words
of advice and announces his intention oi
being with them one more evening in the
house of Simon. The scene Is Introduced
by the leavetaklng of Tobiah. shown In a
good tableau. Mary Magdalene anoints
the head and feet of Christ. Judas
grumbles at the waste of costly ointmenv
and expresses his anxiety as to what will
changes have been made in the manner
of presenting the play. The 4300 specta
tors, now. sit beneath a vaulted iron roof
protected from any Inclemency of
weather. But the purpose, the dignity
and, the beauty of the performance are
'just as they always have been. The fol
lowing graphic account of it ia condensed
from the London Daily News;
The chorus of protecting angels and
spirits, twelve girls and twelve men,
stand in a semicircle on the uncovered
stage. They wear white gold-embroid
ered robes with jeweled girdles, sandals,
mantles of bright colors, fastened by
golden .clasps, and golden coronets on
happen to them all if Christ leaves them
as he will do.
The audience was much interested in
the first appearance of â¢ Mary the 'mother
of Christ Anna Flunger, ,who takes the
part, is the' village postman's ' daughter,
and her acting is nothing short of
velous. Christ is on his way to Jerusalem
and his mother meets him and asks the
pireous question. "When shall I see: him
again?" She is very touching in her sim
ple grief an*d in the humility with which
she accepts her inevitable fate.

any of the startling occurrences that maae
political warfare in Kentucky fall Httie
short of real, bloody civil war will recog
nize that the field for narrative is remark
ably rich, and the authors have taken full
advantage of It. They have given them
selves free swing on the~dramatic phases
of the situation, and have made substan
tially a history of what has been a cam
paign only less replete with general Inter
est than a national electoral convulsion.
-It is to be noted that despite their close
relations with the campaign and the dra
matic manner in which they have nar
rated it. the authors display an impartial
attitude toward the rival parties. The
book does not offer to solve the questions
brought out in the campaign. Neither does
the work attempt to present any particu
lar argument, leaving that to the strong
wills and* great minds that are even yet
One of the most dramatic scenes in the
play Is that between Christ and' Pilate,
. when the Governor, surrounded by his
Hctors and guards, appears on the balcony
of his house and calls upon the people to
choose between > i Christ and Barabbas.
Christ is wearing the scarlet mantle the
soldiers threw over him and the crown
of thorns, and carries a rush for a scepter.
Barabbas Is a vile-looking Idiot, the crim
inal out of- a "child's "story-book, and the
Â«ry for "Barabbas!" bounds very cruel.
Pilate, in all his glory, washes his hands
in a golden basin in vain disclaimer of his
responsibility. The multitude answer in
chorus, "Let It be upon us and our chil
dren."Christ Is then sentenced to death.
Next Christ is seen on the way to Gol-
Thls Is, of course, . the introduction of a
dramatic scene, in which Judas goes to
the Sanhedrin to return the thirty silver
pieces, having repented of his treachery.
He is 'laughed at and hooted, and goes
into the wood, where madness seizes him,
and he hangs himself on a tree with his
girdle. .In the next scene, which is -pre
ceded by a picture. of Daniel denounced
to King Darius,. Pontius Pilate appears
for the first time. Christ stands meekly
before Pilate, and does not help him in
his defense of him. At last, to satisfy the
clamoring crowd, Pilate orders Christ to
be scourged.
there has been published-a new edition of
her earlier work, "Diana Tempest." While
"Diana Tempest" can -hardly be said to
rank with her better known work, still
it possesses great merit, and the many
comparisons which haVe been drawn be
tween tho two and the great demand for
Miss Cholmondeley's books will make this
new edition very acceptable. An excellent
photograph : of the young author Is given
on the front page and an interesting bio
graphical sketch has been incorporated
in the book. "Diana Tempest" was Miss
Cholmondeley's third book and it took her
three years and a half to write.lt. It
was the result of so much mental labor
that her health gave way entirely shortly
after the book was finished. To her two
sisters, Diana and Victoria, Miss Choi

literature, for they have acted as help

her by giving graphic accounts of the en

8and everybody looked forward to rough
riding and fighting, too. So when Man-
Icy asked to go his father refused and
then the boy begged hard and It wasn't
an easy matter to turn him down. So at
lart the general bought him off for $10.
That settled the matter, for Manley knew
that the ?19 would tty a bugle, and that
was what he wanted most of all. He was
01-" T at the Presidio is a man trtth a
story tr. tell. He is one EX. F. Haber
kam. The story he has to tell is of
the fighting and the death of Major.
General Henry Lawton, V. S. V.
The reason that one Haberkam knows the
Ftory better than most pecple is that he
was the bugler who rode with Lawton
through the stoop, treacherous mile? that
led to death.
"He was a pood general; yes, he was a
pood genera!." pays Haberkam. "If the
Filipino bullet that picked him out had
chosen somebody that didn't count so
much we'd be a luckier army to-day."
Habe.rkam was bugler of the bodyguard
that went north with Lawton on the 17th
of last August, and In the long stretches
of marching- and waiting and privation
and shooting that made up that trip he
came to know the army plant as only a
few were privi^oped to know him. He paw
him in everyday life. â¢ in the everyday
wear and tear that rubs the varnish off
a man arid shows him up for what he If.
It has been paid that Lawton never or
dered men ahead. "Come on," he would
cry. and lead the way himself. Haberkam
was one of the closest to follow.
Tb/Â» campaign was planned upon the
people of the north, but they are not a
fierce people and Agulnaldo was not
among them 5n the place where our army
had scheduled him to appear. From Ma
nila to San Fernando, eighty miles by
raJl. and frcm there on to San Felipe and
to places that are unspeilable as well as
unpronounceable. There was rain then and
there were fearful roads and mudholes
where men Ftuek and swore. There was a
march <if eleven Lours In the storm, with
no food for those who rasrehed. There
was the r'vrr to toss, a river that was
angry and snarling and that snatched up
two men in the crossing. Those are the
times when a soldier knows his com
ma ndcr.
Dacopan vio? tho place that the mis
taken campaign plans had assigned as
the capital of these northern people.
"And when wo get to Dagopan," says Ha
br-rkam, "after : ! we'd been thinking
about its l>eir:jr the stronghold and a plac*
to be attackedâ well, you know what we
founds On!y a bunch of Irjts crowded to
petl-.cr .and making no more than what
you nii^ht call a miserable little villas*
with the best r.r.n:p you could use. It was
a dreary. diEcouraping business, the
â¢whole of It. but you'd never see Lawton
g;virg up. He wasn'.t the kind of man
to do that. He acted as If he'd made up
h!s minn that we had to win, and there
Â¦wasn't to be any fooling until it was
d'Ti**."
It was of the your.g Captain Lawton
of early days that General Miles wrote:
"At* length I selected from Fort Hua
chuca an ofSeer by the name of Captain
H. XV. Lawton of the Fourth United
States Cavalry, who. I thought, would
fulfill all the requirements as comman
der. First of all. because he believed
that these Indians could be subjugated.
Officers who do not believe In success and
are always ready to show how a thing
cannot be dene and give labored and log
ical reasons and arguments why it would
be useless to attempt to accomplish a
purpose as a rule are not the kind of men
to bÂ« selected for any hazardous ect<fr
prlse. While some men may be over
z^alcjs and unduly confident, yet' where
you find a man of sterling ability an<S
clear, strong will power who believes that
a thlr.g can be accomplished, the chances
are that, given an opportunity, he will be
more l!kc!y to succeed than one who has
no faith In what he may be called upon
to do, or required to undertake."
**It took that kind of a general to lead
Â¦us on an eleven-hour march In the rain
without a crumb to eat. It took that
kind cf a general to lead us under ever>
bad condition agalrst what we boys call
â¢the red-trousered fellows'â they are
Ajrulr.aldo's best.
"Those red trousers are the Spanish
ones and they ere worn by the better
class, the cleverer class of men on the
Island. The common is made of blue
cloth â like these."
He unlocked th*> soldier chest, whore
burglar a'ann trilled In response tQ the
twisting key. and among the treasures
th=t soldiers cling to was a souvenir pair
of Filipino trousers. They are made of a
blue Ftriped goods about as dark as our
own Jeans and not nÂ«\rly so heavy. Their
flimsy coolness tells the tale of the cli
mate.
"Anaerie-an bodies were not the only
ones to disappear in that river. Filipinos
wcrÂ«* found, too, and an ugly report about
them reached us. but I don't know any
thing of its truth. It was said that their
commander was hampered by too many
men and cut the throats of some and
threw them into the river.
"At the end of our four months' trip
Lawton led us toward the south line.
There was not much doubt about otir
findJncr plenty of fighting there. There
1? a big difference between the northern*
and southern natives. In the south men

"Through all our marches little Manley
Lawton was with our party. He never
left his father In Cuba, though he was
ehot through the sole of his shoe, and he
never left h!m In the Philippines until

"I never heard him swear butonce in all
the time I was with him,".says the bugler,
"but I. knew "-'when he didn't approve of

only 13 years old then, but he was erarj>
for ctrvlce, and the bugle was the height
of his ambition. He was always begging
me to teach him. We were great friends,
he and Iâ you see, he was so plucky antl
so dead in earnest about what he under
took that a fellow couldn't help liking
himâ sort of as if he was another fellow,
you see?
"If the camping place could have been
foundâ fcut what good are the ifs? The
rain was coming down in such sheets a3
you probably never saw, and we; could
not see ahead nor could our horses. We
of the bodyguard â Troop^ I It was â rode
floundering and stumbling horses over
roads that we could not understand. We
were mounted on the little native beasts;
they are hardly bigger than a New
foundland dog, but they are the hardiest;
animals I ever rode They can't be left
together, for they quarrel like madâ lie
down on the ground to fight It outâ but
for rough use I counted my little pony
one of the best frier.ds I ever had. Later
on v.e all had our ponies taken away and
large horses given us, and every last man
of the troop was sorry. A big horse
doesn't make seventy miles in twer.ty
four hours, and I've seen a Filipino pony
do it.
"As the hours went on we found that
we were getting pretty badly mixed up.
We rode here and there and tried to trace
a. way, and the long and the short of if.
was that we soon found we were lost.
General Lawton was with usâ ahead of
us, thct isâ he was riding his big flooded
bay and we were following as best we
could through the storm. Most of the
time we couldn't see him at all, only
heard his Etron^ voice shouting to us to
come on. That was his way of giving or
ders. It takes' the fear out of a man if
there is any in him. If the general can
go he thinks he can.
"We started out as night was coming
on. and that ride was as much as thirty
seven miles all told, though the distance
is little more than thirty miles in a
straight line. But we rode out of the way
and crashed up a hill that we need never
have touched, because we were lost. It's
an awful feeling to be lost out there in
those rocky places where the horse under
you fights to keep his footing and with
the rain coming so that you can't see at
all. And when it's nfght into the bargain
It feels a good deal worse, for somehow
it's always more lonesome in the night.
"By 6 o'clock in the morning we struck
the mountain rear San Mateo and we got
our bearings a little. We could see the
general as well as hear him. He sat erect
as always on his bay horse, and he made
a big:, splendid kind of figure in spite of
the terrible ride, for his white helmet waa
on his head, the helmet that he always
Â¦wore. He was dressed In khaki, and
above the suit was a pommel slicker, of
yellow oilcloth. A costume like that made
him conspicuous later on to the men whe
fired upon us."
No wonder he was a target for the sav
age aim in that day's battle. His height
alone made him that, for he was five
Inches more than six feet in height, built
strong in proportion. It has been eald
that he could at one time pick up an ordi
nary sized man and throw him a rod, as
boys throw stones.
"When the general saw clearly how the
land lay," went on the soldier, slowlyâ
he had come to the part of the story that
makes lower tones over the little pyramid
stove of the tent â "when he saw. he gave
an order. The cavalry was to divide like
a V. We advanced near the river.
"Just after we started there was one
shot from the enemy â that was all. We
did net hear from them again until we
had advanced as much as 300 yards. Then,
they opened fire.
'"I was close behind the general all the
time. There were about fifteen of uswlth
himâ only a little group behind a clump
nf bushes. The rain was still falling, but
it was not blinding. Only dreary.
"The Filipinos firing on us were across
the river at a distance of about 350 yards.
Mnj;t bf the shots seemed to come/from a
fellow in a tree. He had a Mauser.. I
knew by the sharp sound. It's altogether
different from that of a Remington. His
shots came fast and they were well
aimod. and I believe they, did nearly all
the harm.
"nre-cke-nridge was shot. He did not
die, but his wound was a bad one and he
fell. I remember it all plain enough. Law
ton saw him fall and exclaimed: 'The
poor boy:' That was all. As he turned to
look at him that fellow In the tree, I be
lieve it was. aimed again. The shot hit
the general in the middle of the breast.
I've seen many men shot and I know that
they always die when they are shot there.
"He fell and died Instantly without an
other word. Captain King ran to him.
Some paid It was only a wound, but I was
sure .then that the general was dead. He
was a brave man and a good one.
"He shed very little blood. The chest
swelled in a peculiar way, but otherwise
he looked the Fame as in life. He was a
good man. Â¦Â» . ; .
"You have reatJ. perhaps, how the body
was carried back to headquarters. Eight
men carried the litter across the river to
San Mateo. The stream was swift and It
was a fearful undertaking. From there
the body was taken by means of two rick
shaws faf.ened together."
This la the story of the bugler of , Troop*
Iâ the Flying Troop, as It was called
around Manila, for the way it was always
flying over the island without thought of
stopping for food. This Is the story, of ]
a man who knetr thcgeneral ana wnÂ»t
was his. even: to the ridingr whip he al
ways carried fastened to ins right Iwristâ
the j riding whip that was taken from hla
dead hand. He was a quiet commander,
like most big men â ona who did not storm.

THE SUISTBAY CAI,Ii.
General Henry Lawton died when over
50 years of age. He had belonged, body
and soul, to the United States army since
he enlisted as an lS-year-old private In
the Civil War. He had fought In many
more than a hundred battles.
"Somehow he seemed to think ho
couldn't bo hitâ maybe he was supersti
tious about it," says Haberkam.

Brown?" Mrs. Brownâ No. I'm not very
.tired; but, I might as well own up, I'm
: about ready to burst. It's all Tcnny's
fault that I'm so puffy to-day. She
thought that I had too much abbdomen,
or abdohmen,' whatever you call it, and
hauled me off to one of these here French
corset-makers. Well, they d<> work won
ders, for Â«look at me now; I'm just as flat
as a pancake, and you know what I used
to be." She strokes the new corset ap
provingly. The young man blushes a lit
tle and tries to look at anything but the
spot indicated. The girl says slmperlngly,
"Mamma. Mr. Simpson Isn't used to talk
ing auout corsets so familiarly."
Mrs. Brownâ Well, he'll soon get used
to It if he stays a while in Paris. â¢ I. ami
sakes, corsets ain't a circumstance to tho
things they talk about in this town. , You
know, Jenny, what the folks at our hotel
told us last night!
'Jenny gasps perceptibly and hastens to
change the subject. "Oh. Mr, Simpson,
do tell us something abput the, pictures!
Scene In the art gallery of the exposi
tion. Three Americans enter. A girl
dressed in the latest Paris fashlpn, a
spruce young man and a fat, matronly
person, evidfently the girl's mother. The
old lady is v<*ry warm, very puffy and
very red in theface. She takes a seat,
and leans against the back of the bench
so that her feet do not touch the floor.
She manipulates her fan furiously. The
young man and the girl remain standing.
The former addresses the old lady very
solicitously: "Are' you very tired, Mrs.
anxious to get into the twentieth 'centjury
procession, Just like everybody else.'^h
their building there Is not even a plctarre :
of the Acropolis, not a shadow of broken
statuary. Evidently the modern Greeks
are trying to go it alone without the aid
Of their forefathers* ghosts. For my own
part this new, Greek is pitifully uninterest^
ing. The fact that they manufacture stiff
shirt fronts in Athens or hairbrushes In
Samothrace does not Inspire me. with the
slightest* enthusiasm.
Paris, which is alvrsys a <lcvt)tce of tha
curious and bizarre, has established a
museum of frauds. ' The project^ yet In
Its inception, but the Idea has met great
popular approval and thousands have al
ready visited the small building set apart
for the illustration and preservation of
methods whereby the Government has
been robbed of its due.
The collection is a rogues' gallery with
out portraits, and resembles the old Curio
Hall in the Treasury Department at
Washington. The American gallery of
frauds was often referred to when this
scheme was first broached by the French
Government. It was argued against Its
adoption that after many years the public
exhibit at Washington had been discon
tinued, because it was believed â and la
one or two cases found to be trueâ that
young men gazing at the Ingenious de
vices ; for counterfeiting and the clever
schemes worked by criminals to defraud
the Government had been spurred to emu
lation and had acted upon the. hint.
The French mind, following the question
of effect a turn further, however, cams
to the conclusion that by showing to tho
public at large thq^even the most Inge
nious methods failed and that the. opera
tor, however clever, came to grief, citi
zens with a desire for emulation would bs
deterred by the' knowledge that escape
was Impossible.
So the museum of frauds is an estab
lished faot, as much a sight place as the
morgue. Clever and curious are the
things, there to be seen. A roll of cloth
with a can in ore Â«nd shows tho elabo
rate method taken by distillers In, the
country to escape the douane at tho city
walls.
Another interesting piece is a skin of a
dog. This had been cleverly fitted over a
bright black and tan pup and covered
hundred? of dollars' worth of valuabla
laces wrapped about the dog*3 body and
sent over the border from Italy. It la sup-,
posed that" the revenue thieves smuggled
In thousands of dollars In this way before
they were detected by an accident. A
genGarme'a dog engaged the brute smug
gler in a fight and the outer skin came off.
The dog was followed and Its owner ar
rested.

Mrs. Brown excavates in the region of
the new corsets, puts on her glasses and
looks again. "Oh. yes; I see them. But
I tell you, Jenny, that isn't why it's called
â¢Waiting.' Don't you see those cabs there
lined up before a building; they're'walt
lng for customers. It was stupid of us
"Yes, mamma, there are some people
in the background waiting under an awn
ing. Put on your glasses and you will
see them."
Mr. Simpson is so embarrassed after
this unexpected poetical flight that he
turns all sorts of colors and again looks
in the catalogue. The old lady is eying
the picture attentively. "I must say. Mr.
Simpson, I don't quite understand why
they call the picture 'Waiting.' I suppose
the 'idea is that they're waiting for the
rain to stop: but everybody seems to be
getting out of it as fast as possible. I
don't see any one waiting." Mr. Simpson
again looks uneasy. The same thought
had undoubtedly crossed his own mind.
He turns once more to the number In the
catalogue, but Miss Jenny comes to hl3
rescue. -
whose songs gush from the heart as
showers from the clouds of summer or
tears frcm the eyelids start. You remem
ber that old verse, don't you?"
"Yes. very much. It is more my style
of picture than the other one. I'm not
fond of historical subjects. They're too
pretentious. I like the simpler painters
on a rainy day. It
In No. 42. He- again consults the cata
logue r.nd announces that No. 42 is en
titled "Waiting." "Isn't it exquisite?"
murmurs Mi3s Jenny in a half-mystlfled
but non-committal way. "So well exe
cuted and so much feeling. Don't you ad
mire it, Mr. Simpson?"
Isn't this one splen
did! Do tell me tho
name of It I"
She turns to a
large N canvas por
traying a man on
horse back falling
from a precipice.
They are really In
the Spanish section,
but Mr. Simpson,
evidently a little
muddled after the
confidence of Mrs.
Brown, seems to be
laboring under the
impression that^ it la
the English section.
He takes a cata
logue of the latter
from his pocket and
turns to the number
of the picture.
"Number 33. Ah. I
have itâ The Execu
tion of Charles I."
They all three
look for a second in
silence. Mr. Slmp-
Eon Is not quite sat
isfied. Ho looks
again at the num
ber, then at the cat
alogue. There it is
as big as lifeânum
ber 33â the execu
tion of Charles I.
Mrs. Brown Is the Â¦
first to break the si
lence. *
"Well. I must say
that they had a \-ery
queer way of exe
cuting people In
those times. I sup
pose they put him
on horseback and
then . chased the
horse from the prec
ipice. It makes me
think of the wax
works in New York,
where they have el
ephants stepping on
men's heads. Have
you ever seen the
waxworks, Mr.
Simpson? Talk
about things being
natural. There ain't
a picture in all this
exhibition that Is aa
true to life as the
waxworks."
Mr. Simpson is not
disposed to linger
before "the execu
tion of Charles I."
He turns to a less
pretentious canvas,
a Paris street scene

Naturally the lady pouted.
"What, are you net satisfied? We!!. I

The lady didn't say i:i so many words
"You may keep your old buildings and

and tho Czar feit it.
"My dear, you distress me. I should

cent lover, this Czar. He had taxed his
Ingenuity ar.d spent his rubles with an
.astonishing UbenUity, all for her sake.
"Tee, ehe would be content. That was a
Xitanber of weeks ago. During these
creeks ehe bad looked her fill at the jew
eled map, and its scintillations no longer
charm^her. Surely it is a poor substi
'ttxte for the actual presence of the Czar.
3Co, he elmply must come to pive eclat
to the exposition. He must set the good
example to other Kings and Princes.
'Tour excuse about the President is a
poor one," she intimates. "It is for me
that ycu most come, not for him. Will
â¢not my charming personality atone foi
mome Blight humiliation? Indeed, I shall
never believe that you love me should you
refuse me this trifling proof. It is the
only thing that 1 demand as the test of
your devotion."
ICow the Czar is nothing if not gallant.
The eight of this lady who has honored
him with po much affection -almost hy
sterical over his continued refusal proves
too much for him and at last he consents.
Just when he will arrive he does not
Fay, but the consent is sufficient. France
Is happy, the success of the exposition is
assured, for the word has gone forth that
the Czar Is coming. "Hark, hark, hark,
the little dogs bark, the Czar Is coming
to town!"
Just as was expected, this announcement
has given the "expo-,
eition a greater im-t
portar.ee among oth
er sovereigns and
those who cannot
come are at least
sending their re
grets. The Emperor
of Germany, rumor
has it, "is v just dying
to come," but he is
one sovereign who
has not been eufQ-'
clently urged. InJ"*
fact. the papers'
have coolly invited
him to remain'
away, to spare him
self as well as the
French people an in-'
evitable humiliation.
The Prince of "Wales
will arrive very soon
to present the com- 1
pliments and the re
grets of the Queen,
but his presence will
hardly create an un
usual stir. It will
not savor at all of
the extraordinary,
as the Prince spends
half b'.s time in
Paris. He is quite
as well known here
as in London, hav
ing a permanent
suite of apartments
at one of the Mg
hotels. P e rsonally
the Prince is very
popular with Parl
fiar.s. He is more
flexible in tempera
ment than most
English mm and
adapts himself quite
gracefully to French
ideas. The King
and Queen of Italy
will probably arrive
before very many
weeks, the King of
Sweden is "here at
present, snd the
King of GretceÂ»has
been here and has
departed. The most
pathetic of all the
regrets, I think, is
from the little King
of Spain. The mam
ma Queen thinks
that ' following the
expenses of the late
unfortunate war the
King cannot afford
to make the trip,
which, of course,
â¢would have to be
accomp 1 i s h e d In
royal splendor. And
it is all your fault, you horrid Amer
icans, that the little King cannot f-".
the exposition! I am sure you will feel
ashamed of yourselves for cheating a poor
little boy out of all of his fun! A sympa
thetic old lady, reading the excuse of the
little King as published in one of the dally
papers, looked up from the column
the other evening and said to me very
seriously. "I should think he could visit
his grandmother on the Avenue Kleber."
The old ex-Queen of Spain lives in Paris
and has quite a spacious residence near
the Arc de Triomphe. Certainly the ex
pense of a small boy visiting his grand
mother ought not to bankrupt any nation,
even if that nation be poor old Spain. But
undoubtedly this manner of simplifying
thlnps has not occurred to the Queen
mother.
The other day I saw the King of Greece.
I happened to be passing the Elysee Pal- ,
ace when out he came precceded by an
escort of French soldiers. It was the first
real live king that I had ever seen and I
must confess that it gave me a shock
Not that there was anything extraordin
ary about him, but on the contrary be
cause he was just exactly like an ordin
ary mortal. He lifted his hat as he
passed, revealing a very bald head and I
wondered bow he looked when he wore his
crown. But do kings wear crowns nowa-^
days? I suppose they don't and I experi-/
enced a pang of disappointment in think
ing so. I lament the good old days when
"the King sat in the parlor counting out
his money, while the Queen was In the
kitchen e*tlng bread and honey." This
dear old King always wore a crown and
had long, curly locks and beautiful whis
ktxs. If he of Greece be a fair sample
there has been a degeneration in kings
since the days of long ago, when^I found
my greatest delights in royal circles. -.1
shut my eyes and see Â¦whole troops of
kings with whom I used to be on most
friendly terms. There was old King Cole,
that merry old soul, a little free and easy
perhaps, yet always arrayed as became a,
king, .with velvet and ermine and Jewels,
rJot in one single instance do I find the
igrihble prece'dent ofa bald-headed king in
plain black clothes and wearing, forsooth,
a top-hat instead of a crown!
King George of Greece, It seems, was
simply passing through and intends to re
turn later a little more formally. I be
lieve he did not visit the exposition at all,
or. If so. It was strictly incog^IIIs build

'seems to me to be anything* on earth but

worth it. Just think, now, of what we've
already learned this afternoon. Jenny

whither I went the other day for the
very tiresome purpose of procuring an
up-to-date pass to the exposition. I found
It necessary to wait some little time. Now
I don't like to wait. I should have never
have made a graceful model for the pic
ture entitled- "Waiting." As usual, I man
ifested a little impatience. "I am very
sorry," politely said the young man In
charge, "but It seems Impossible to get
the passes on time. Do you know Mr. M.
II. de Young of San Francisco? Well,
he la here now. and has been here for
two hours, waiting for his pass." This
bit of Information had the desired effect.
I settled myself and waited comfortably,
for it gave me something to think about.
I had been on the point of scorning the
pass and 1 of vending; my way without it.
It only coats 12 cents to go to the expo
sition, and I like to amuse myself by
valuing my time at a greater rate. But
Mr. de Young of California had waited
two hours fcr the sake of thi3 trifling
economy! Is it that Mr. de Tounpr, hav

of time, or is it that Mr. de Touns. havr
Ing made his fortune, appreciates the
value of the 12 cents that it costs to fro
to the exposition? I should like to know
the answer as a hint in fortune making.
Is so much patience for so little money

ONE thing New Jersey has which
cannot be found elsewhere In the

The angry protests of these smaller
and less intelligent pets invariably
arouses the slc-ping farmer, and when Â¦
he reproaches Mattie for breaking In on

down with a distressed expression of
countenance, tapping herself on the chest
with one finger, shaking her head from
tide to tide and chattering violently.
Then the stalks away with a Btatel>
pride to her little oaken tub, which
ctaads at the curb of a , Loiilnz spring.
This little East Indian epicure insists
upon fruit as appetizer at every break
fast, and there will be few displays of
her ugly temper through the day if there
are grapes at her plate when she takes
her chair at table. These she takes so
rapidly that the uninitiated wonders
whore she puts thÂ»m. The truth is r-he

She eats from a plate and can handle a
knife and fork, but only does so when
there are visitors at the Farren farm, as
she. prefers the table manners of long
ago, when every one ate with finger*.
She drinks from a class and drinks deeply
nnd with great relish. Hard cider is her
preferred beverage, while corn and cu
cumbers are her favorite foods. But she
will cat anything That is good to cat and
drink anything with relish, from spring
water to country store whisky.

taking down from its hook a small dinner
bell, swing? it lustily until she sees the
beginning of breakfast preparations. Then
she seats herself at a low table near Mr.
Farren's. and, spreading* a snowy napkin
across her knees, patiently awaits the
coming of the food.
In winter the abl-Jtions are followed by
flressing, and the .jueer po.ses and grim
aces the monkey-woman produces in her
little mirror as she gowns herself in fiery
red or brilliant greenâ her favorite col

in summer she leaves her tub to saunter

ly the work of Mattic's hand and brain.
She loves the .garden as a" mother loves
her child. Here are potatoes and radishes
and cabbages and carrots and unions. and
tettUCC, tomatoes and peas, beans of sev
eral varieties and a fine little lay-out . of
berries. Many a wayfarer has stopped in
amazement at the sight of a monkey act
ually engaged in intelligent farming."
Mattie Has two instincts well developed â
that of the mother, although she has
never been one herself, and that of tho
musician. She Is never happier than
when cuddling in nor. arms and crooning
over one of the frequently arriving pup
pies of the prolific J-ady Guinevere, the
jealous and .snappy Kkye terrier. And as
tor music, although her instruments are
barbaric, a tin pan and a badly soiled cel
ery glass, the little beast has no greater
pleasure than to beat upon them and pro
duce different ringing notes, listening the
while with a rapt and satisfied mien.
Twelve years ago Farmer Farren's
brother went to n country circus, where
he saw the ringmaster fly into a rage and
beat* a little monkey before all the people
who had paid their 10 cent3 to get under
the big white tent. That monkey was Mat
tie. the farmer. Farren's brother said to
the showman:
"What makes you hurt that little beast
so?"
"She's such an ugly" temper," replied tha
showman, "I have to."
"It's you that lias the uely temper I'm,
thinking." said the other Mr. Farren, and
he straightway made a bargain to buy tha
much abused simian and "take her horns
to Sam; lie's so fond of pets."
. .Jn tboso days Mattie's only accomplish
ment was to ride on the back of a big dog
in fi race with several others around the
circus rinp. This did not suit the mon
key, and she made life miserable for her
â¢fiery canine steed by viciously biting his
car throughout the race. Mattie was 10
years old v. hen sh . ieft the circus ring tor

all there she hunches first one shoulder
p.nd then the other, projecting a grape
first from one cheek and then from the
other into her mouth to be swallowed. ,
Breakfast finished. Miss Mattie care
fully flicks any stray crumbs away from
her pouting lips and folds her napkin
neatly, for it must be used again at the
next meal, and while Mattie is not lazy,
Fhe believes in the economy of labor. By
this time the corpulent swine are grunt^
ing for their morning food and the half
hundred carrier pigeons are cooing for
their corn. So, after filling the canaries*
cups with seed and water and throwing
in a bit of green stuff for them to, peck
at. this experienced and competent farmer
monkey starts out with a very responsible
air to discharge her early morning chores
before a hard day's labor In the truck
patch.
She believes in eating, does Mattie. in
food for man and beast, and for man
beast, too. for she likes her own share
immensely. So she liberally fills the
bucket for the ehorting hogs and scatters
grain for the myriad chickens and geese
and for the benutiful carrier pigeons,
which she great iy admires. While the
carriers eat Mattie will stand within their
coop, and, with arms akimbo and small
head critically perched on one side, will
regard th^m with evident pride and with
hiph approval. Farmer Farren describes
ilattie's day's work as follows:
"Then away to the cow pen, for there
old Pretty and Brindle Betty are casting
wistful glances over their shoulders, won
dering when they will be milked. Mattie
delights In milking cows. Her milking
stool is higher than that of the average
milkmaid, for Mattie is not one-third as
tall and her arms are not nearly so long.
Her little hands are quick and strong,
gentle and soft. She cannot carry away
the milk-pails, but this is done by two
little girlsâ Mary and Flora."
On her way from tho milking stool to
the truck patch. Farmer Farren says,
Mattio occasionally spies a stranger ap
proaching throuph the grass â¢ covered
road, and this is so unusual that the little
beast takes alarm at once. and. rushing
to the kitchen, seizes the dinner bell and
wields it with wildly clanging effect. And
if the farmer is far away in the fields
~nd docs nnt hear the loud alarm and the
two little girl? are too busy at egg finding
Matt'o takes it upon herself with many a
well-aimed stone to chase the intruder
away.
The vegetable garden is Mattie's spe
cial pride and pleasure. She loves to
till the soil and to reap the reward of her,
labor. Mr. Farrcn says she 'glories in her'
wealth, and if you are an approved \isÂ»
Hor at the Farren farm Mattie will, after
CW.to'SmÂ©^
bravea the ways of the warriors of long
ago.

one companion, the greatest Indian of the

known as a canoeist and hunter.

2000 miles of water that separate him from
his goal.
Big Thunder, or Frank I/oring. as his
neighbors now know him, is SO years old,
a giant in stature, with muscles and
sinews that have withstood the years. He
can lift a barrel of flour on his shoulder

the seas all the years of their manhood
would he?itate long before trusting them
selves out on the wild Maine coast or
down around Cape Cod, even with a boat
which had a keel and was held together
with nails and iron.
Tradition of the shore has it that once
an oarsman made the journey up the
Sound and into Buzzards Bay In a small
boat, but his attprnpt has deterred others
from trying. Hut even the traditions fall
to tell of such a journey from the north
west along a coast mariners learn
to look for tragedy year after year.
Big Thunder and his companion will
paddle down the Penobscot soon, thirty
miles from their home passing Bangor.
They will take as much provisions a3 their
boat will hold, and they expect when they
get to the mouth of the river to find a
supply of gulls' eggs that will fill the stern
of their canoe. After that they will ex-
a birch bark canoe make it they will mar

If the voyager? pass all these dangers,
however, the journey will then b*Â» easy. It
will be only a short rep.eh to the Race, and
the Sound will give them relief from the
perils of the sea. and they will be aMe to
r>a*ldle their way to the great city which
stands where kinsmen of the Algonquin
race once had their hunting: grounds.
Their journey will then be only a littl*
more than half ended, but the sea will
have no more claim upon them, for they
can paddle down amid the smoke of the
Kill von Kull. thrcush the Raritan canal
and over into the peaceful Delaware. Past
Philadelphia their course will take them
down the Delaware Bay and through the
hunting grnunOs of their kin of long ago â
the Lfnl-I.er.apeâ in the Chesapeake and
Delaware canal.
Across the Chesapeake Bay will be the
old lands of their other cousins, the Pow.
hatnns, and through that will be the way
to the city of the Great Father. But they
must paekllc down the bay many scores of
milea before they can round Point Look
out and turn Into the Potomac and begin
the last reach of their long journey.
Their journey will end in the fall, for
they calculate that the moon may ris* a
hundred times before they reach the city
of the White Father.
Rig Thunder will have many relics of
olden times to show to President McKIn

Big- Thunder's canoe, too. will probably
become one of the curiosities cf the capi

11On my way over from Honduras to.Gua

I grew to. love the youth f ;i his manly
character and generosity. He was about
.10 years of age, handsome and ever spoke
lovingly of his 'Dulcina* in Havana. He
wore about his neck a litle chain to which
was attached a locket. In the locket was
the picture of a beautiful girl, with large
dreamy eyes, regular features of tiÂ«
- Spanish type, and heavy long hair. A
smile displayed even pearly teeth. A.

Izipompolo is the long.nam e for the little fellow that builds
the famous anthills. Thesa hills are from eight to ten feet in height
and are either entirely made of pulverized clay cemented by th*
formic acid secretion from the bodies of the r.nts, or el3e of a com
posite cf straw, twigs and earth. The anthills are very strong, be
ing br.ked by the sun until of almost the density of china. They
are used by the natives for smelting or cooking purposes, making
excellent ovens when excavated and a fire placed inside.
â¢ The hotter the sun the more active is the izipompolo. He is &
most ferocious creature, and is, in addition, an arch demon of fals
ity. .With, ingenious deceit he will eat the heart out of a book, a
bundle of letters or a block of wood in such a way that it appears
uninjured. But the moment you grasp it it crumbles into frag
ments and dust.
This ant is also a scavenger. Kill a fly, mouse or frog, leave it
on ths ground and watch. Along comes an ant. He inspects thÂ©
object, runs all over it, and, as it were, takes its measure. Then he
departs, and soon returns, leading a convoy, which either carry
the object off bodily or set about excavating the victim with their
strong mandibles, so there remains nothing but a skeleton covered
by the cuticle if it be fur or leather.
Thess ants have a great fancy for greasy, oily or sweet sub
stances, and so are unwelcome visitors to the housewife's larder.
Among some of the tribes of Bushmen and Kaffirs this appetite is
turned to a dreadful purpose. Prisoners of war are fastened to a
tree infested by these insects or to one of the anthills, thejr bodies
smeared with honey or fat. Soon the feast is reported and the anta
issue in myriads and literally gnaw the flesh from the bones, the
victims dying a slow and fearful death.
Intlced, it is true that a skeleton left -by -them may retain
its perfect form. If not disturbed, the ants carry out their work
until every vestige of flesh is removed and the white skeleton re
mains glued together by the dense ligaments, which the hot, dry
air converts into structures as rigid as the bones they hold so firm
ly. No more beautiful anatomical specimens can be obtained than
the skeletons of birds and the like "dressed" by thesg dissecting

WHAT GENERAL UPTON SAID ABOUT THE CHINESE.
HEXRY M. MONTELL, formerly of San Francisco but now In the Chinese customs service,' and his wife, who was a
daughter of Captain "Wood of the United States Army, and" was born and reared in this city, are among those
who are within the walls of Tientsin and whose lives are almost despaired of. . The many relatives and friends
of the couple in this city* are very much worried over their perilous "position and fear the worst. Nothing has
been heard from the Montells since the middle of May. At that time they wrote that there were' a few Boxers
outside of the city walls, but that no trouble was anticipated, showing that they , were entirely unprepared for what
followed. Mr. Montell is noted for his daring, and as he always expressed hatred and gutter contempt for the Chin
ese It is feared that he has been led to extremes that- may have cost him his life before now. . . * '
Mr. Montell is an uncle of Councilman Felton Taylor of Oakland and a brother of Ed Montell of the local cus
toms service. His aged mother, now 95 years old, resides at the home of Mr. Taylor In Oakland: Â¦ George . Montell. a
brother who Is In the Chinese customs service and stationed at -Shanghai, has gone up. with the troops to look after

REGULAR TROOPS FOR
UTILIZATION IN CHINA
LONDON", July S.â There is nothing
in the few dispatches received last
r.ight to add to the ray of hope
raised regarding the fate of the
legations at Peking by yesterdaj-'s
dispatches from Washington and mes
sages from other sources indicating thÂ«t
the legations were still standing on July
3 and the recent attacks by the Boxers
had beer. Flight. News from other points
was distinctly disquieting. A report from
Chtrfu, dated July T, says the Catholic
Bishop, two priests and two nuns have
been murdered.
A report from Moukden. dated July 5,
says the Danish mission at Hin Tun was
surrounded by Boxers. According to the
report It would be possible to hold out
on!y two days. A party of Cossacks, resi
dents of Moukden, and the British Con
buI had started for the relief of those
besieged at the Danish mission.
The situation at Tientsin on July 3 is
said to have been most serious. Japanese
*.nd Russian forces are reported to have
been hurrying there from Taku, but ac
cording to some accounts mutual distrust
exists between the allies.
A report from Shanghai, dated July 7,
says that the British warships are vigi
lantly watching for the purpose of pre
venting any attempt of the Chinese
to cross the Yang-tse-Kiang.
Energy of Â¦ America,
"WASHINGTON, July 7.â The issue to
day of the formal orders for the dippatch
to the East of more than GGOO troops from
the army posts in the United States was
a manifestation of the energy with which
the Government is now about to act in the
Chinese matter. True, the** troops are
nominally destined for the Philippines to
replace the volunteers now there, but it
Is admitted that they are being sent out
by a route that will easily admit of de
flection to Taku or some other convenient
Chinese _ port. Possibly Consul General
Goodnow'B cablegram representing the le
gations as being active as late as the 3d
Inst. may have had soa< thing to do with
this radical action. Whatever the cause,
if these troops are landed in China, to
g-ether with the Ninth Infantry, supposed
to be now at Taku. and the marine and
naval contingent, the United States will
have a force in action commensurate with
her interests and In proportion to the
European forces. Japan is to begin oper
ations with the full consent of Europe,
and It (a calculated that fuli foreign rein
forcements, including our own. will arrive
Jn China, if they are landed at all, in se-a
pon to f.nish the work left by tho Japa
r.c-se. The orders to-day to the troops, it
Js believed at the State Department, have
an indirect but most important bearing on
the situation in Chir.a. Once the Viceroys
of Ortral and Southern China become
satisfied that the foreign legions are actu
ally coming in force they may be counted
upon to take the warning to themselves

3east. > Evidently Consul General Good
now'a suggestion ot yesterday had its ef
fect, for he pointed out himself the bene
ficial effects that the addition of troops to
the soldiers now in China would have.

Shanghai to the London office of the In
spectorate of Chinese Maritime Customs,
saying that two legations were, the day
the courier left, holding out against the
troops and Boxers and that the troops
had lost 2000 men and the Boxers many
leaders. Mr. Warren adds that the mes
senger, says the troops Â¦were much dis
heartened by their losses and that the
Boxers claim their mystic powers have
been broken by the foreigners and that
they dare not approach the legations.
It is further asserted that the foreigners
at Peking ought to be able to hold out for
a long time as they have sufficient food
and ammunition.
HEAVY LOSS AMONG
. . THE CHINESE TROOPS
In conclusion M. Deleasse- dwelt upon
the necessity of. a perfect accord among
the powers, and declared that such accord
really exists at the present time. I
* Four thousand French troops, he con
tinued, had already started, and another
4000 will leave before July 20. Other troops
will follow, according to the emergency
of the situation. Measures will also be
taken' to make'the naval- force worthy of
France, who never intended to abdicate
any of. her rights.
The Minister explained the dangers of a
declaration of war. He favored action at
Peking similar to France's action in Yuan
Nan Sen, and had suggested it to the pow
ers, but the situation at Peking was dif
ferent. The Government had disappeared
before the insurrection, which would only
yield to force, and it was this force which
it was necessary to employ.
Â¦ "Against whom could war be declared?
The Imperial Government appears either
to have been abducted or imprisoned by
the rebels, but the Viceroys do not seem
disposed to obey the rebel chiefs."
"Japan has expressed to- us her desire
to act in accord with the other powers
and do nothins without them. France
has Informed the Japanese Government
that It will see with pleasure the co-ope
ration of Japan in the common cause."

SAN FRANCISCANS WHO ARE IN DANGER AT TIENTSIN.
Henry M. Montell and Wife Prisoners in the Chin?se City.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLINGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON. July 7.â There is a distinctly easier feeling
in official and diplomatic circles here as the result of the action of Russia in assenting to the Japanese proposi
tion to send a sufficient force into China to suppress the Boxer rebellion. Though the Japanese have up to this
time only given orders to one: division to proceed-to Taku,- it- would not be surprising, should she mobilize an
other division and have it ready for embarkation to China in case developments there indicate the necessity of
reinforcements. Before sending additional. troops Japan would in all probability consult the several powers, as she did
respecting the dispatch of one division under orders, and it Is likely that Russia would not accept the proposal of the*
Tokio Government with any more willingness than she recently displayed. Should , need of additional troops be
shown, however, there is no doubf that the United States individually - would be willing to have the Tokio authorities
send as many p* might be necessary. It is likely in this event that" pressure would again have to be applied to Russia,
just as was done by the powers, with the exception of Germany, which according to information received here declined
to make any representations to the St. Petersburg â¢ Government relative to the poHcy it should pursue.
The authorities are hopeful, however, that no more troops than those in Japan and the other powers have under or
ders will be required. The Japanese military strength In China will be 22.000; Russia, 13,000; United States, 13,000, pro
vided all the troops under should be sent to Taku; and Great Britain; Germany and France are- expected to
make up at least 25,000 men. Should all the troops the nations at this moment contemplate sending be not'diverted, the
allied force in China will be 75,000 men. Of course some time must elapse before all these troops will arrive at Taku. and
some of them, notably those given orders by this Government, may not go at all. .
A report has been circulated that the Chinese Embassador recently asked Russia to extend a protectorate over
China. No Information confirmatory of this report has been had in Washington, and it is frankly stated by officials
that they do not believe it. Knowing the. relation in which the Novoe Vremya stands toward the Russian Government,
the authorities attach considerable importance to its statement that Russia accepts the policy proposed by the United
States. It is stated that beyond the Russian hesitancy to agree to the dispatch of Japanese troops to Taku, nothing
has been received here to indicate that Russia has any other object in view than to protect her subjects and their in
terests, and to withdraw from China when this is accomplished.

BERLIN. July 7.â The news from
China overwhelms -everything here.
The usually quiet, self-contained
German nation, both high and low.
lias become deeply nervous. Every
bit of news from China is commented
upon heatedly everywhere. Opinions dif
ler locally among the masses, but the ma
jority believes with the Government that
the Chinese situation is most serious.
This results, too. from Emperor William
and a number of the Cabinet Ministers
having postponed their summer vacations,
because it is expected that before long
The weightiest decision must be taken.
His Majesty's Chinese reward dispatch
is commented on by the press. The Tage
blatt says:
â¢'This "manifestation of the solidarity of
the interests of all the civilized nations
thows the broadness of the Emperor's
views and sentiments."
Emperor William will on Monday ac
company the Gorman ironclad division,
bound for China, into the North Sea. It
is known in the Emperor's entourage that
his Majesty, in his usual impulsive way,
not or.lv pave utterance to many undip
lomatic* thoughts and opinions of tho
riews of the assassination of Baron yon
Kettelor, the late German Minister at Pe
king, but could with difficulty be re
strained from following the dictates of
his heart and forthwith ordering a regu
lar army corps to be mobilized and tent
to China. The more sober views of the
Minister of I-'ort-ign Affairs. Count von
Bulow, prevailed only after several
lengthy conferences.
William's Warlike Words.
Japan's Suggestion.
Among those who were ear witnesses of
the Kmperors remarks to the marines
at WilhWmshaven previous to their de
parture for China it is known that Ms aa
iiress was much more strongly worded
than officially reported, and the newspa
tK>rs= of Wilhelmshaven and that vicinity
jiublis:h the original version, In which was
the following: , .
"I hope to re-establish peace with the
pword and take vengeance in a manner
never before seer by the world. I send
vou to eradicate the dishonor done to
the fatherland by barbarians. I shall
r.ot rest until the German colors fly from
the Peking wall."
A number of interesting press utter
ances appear to-day. The semi-official
Post has an inspired article in which the
reasons why Germany cannot counsel
Russia to accept Japanese intervention
ere set forth in detail. The writer eays:
"The first principle of German policy
is to do nothing that could be interpreted
as an act of partisanship against Russia.
AH attempts by Kngland to induce Ger
many to abandon her neutral position
toward the diplomatic negotiations now
Sn progress will fail. That England is
desirous of Japanese intervention is com
prehensible, in view of England's weak
military position and her rivalry with
Russia. For Germany matters are differ
ent. The abandonment of our traditional
friendship with Russia would be too in
adequately rewarded by England's pla
tonic approval."
Another inspired article In the Neueste
Narhriehten says:
"In Berlin we make German politics and
not English politics. Germany cannot
support a motion to entrust Japan with
a mandate until she accurately knows
what practical deductions Japan will
draw therefrom."
The Foreign Office to day informed the
correspondent of the Associated Press
that Japan quite recently made a sugges
tion to th<* powers asking what they in-
Tended to do in China. Germany answered
that country considered that harmony
of the powers in action was the chief
thing, but the representatives of the Ger

GERMANS BECOME
DEEPLY NERVOUS
REGARDING CHINA
Reward for Rescue of For
eigners Shows Broad
ness of Views.
Copyrighted. 1900, by the Associated Press.
LONDON, July 7.â By the average
Britisher the present situation in
China is generally referred to as "a
crime of the powers." This view
is shared by almost everybody not
connected with the Foreign Office. With
the uncontradicted rumors that the help
less European women and children were
tortured to death at Peking there has
come home to all classes, all papers and
all parties a keen, sickening sense of Great
Britain's helplessness. Some go even far
ther and describe Great Britain's atti
tude as an ignominy unequaled in her
history. It must not be gathered that
this self-criticism excludes equally severe
criticism on the other powers concerned.
Tito preponderance of criticism Is only
directed against the home government in
the hope that it will bring some result.
"The cry is: "What is the good of Lord
Salisbury saying that the international
understanding is harmony when the har
mony will not let Japan step in and save
the lives of our Minister, the men, women
and children in his charge?"
The events and rumors of the week have
completely changed the public attitude
toward China. It is no longer a question
of spheres of influence and the mainte
nance of British power in the Far East,
but it is a matter of saving human lives
If possible and if that is baffled an over
whelming desire for a speedy. and terri
ble revenge. Emperor William's stern in
vocation of vengeance has had a heartfelt
echo in Great Britain and there are Indi
cations that the Foreign Office is awak
ening to the strength of this feeling and
Is taking such steps that international
harmony shall not in future interfere with
independent action when great emergen
cies arise.
The naval stations have become centers
of activity and ships and troops are hur
rying eastward. Parliament will be asked
for an. additional million pounds for the
navy and the inefficient vessels will be
ordered to be struck off the efficient list.
The attitude of the United States toward
China is but little understood, and is gen
erally believed to be entirely controlled
by the political conditions of the ante
election period. It is hoped that Japan's
star will now arise in the East and save
the situation, and the popular demand is
that whether or not Russia agrees Great
liritain shall speedily mako herself strong
enough to unite with Japan, if the exig
encies of the situation demand such ac
tion. The nation is tired of "harmonious
accord" that ls barren of result. ,' It is
useless to speculate upon how far Lord
Salisbury will be able to meet this popu
lar demonstration by means of the negoti
ations at present progressing, though
hypothesis regarding their outcome 'fills
countless columns in the British papers.
While the news from China continues
to -completely overshadow events in
South Africa, these have by no means
ceased to be worthy of record. When it
is understood that the last month's
casualties, from June 5 to July 5. amount
ed to over 3000, including 1200 deaths, it
will be realized thatthe latter chapters of
the war, though comparatively unherald

PARIS, July 7.â This week has been
most eventful and one of deep significance
to all observing Americans. Indications
have not been lacking during the past
year of*the anxiety of the French Gov
ernment and the French press to obliter
ate the unfriendly feeling > toward France
aroused in America by" the v alleged hostile
attitude of this country toward the United
States in the war with Spain and to en
deavor by every means in its power to re
establish Franco-A,merican relations on a
more friendly,- basis. These efforts have
been attended by a most / satisfactory
measure of success, and the participation
of the French Government in and the ex
ceptionally cordial tone of the French
press toward the Washington and Fourth
of July fetes have given an unmistakable
stamp to the direction of France's foreign
policy. American functionaries here, in
their contact with the official world, have
been brought to share in the conviction
that France is sincerely desirous of secur
ing the good will of America.
Archbishop Ireland, speaking on the
subject of the Washington and Lafayette
presentations, said:
"I can testify that they have had a re
markably good effect on the people of
France. They have opened their hearts
to us and they have found that the Amer
ican nation is a people of sentiment and
not merely a commercial people."
The action taken this week by M. Ger
ville-Reache, one of the representatives
in the Chamber of Deputies for Guada
loupe. Indicates that the good effect pro
duced among Frenchmen by the American
sympathy displayed at these fetes may
bring forth practical fruits.
He has published an article in the
Kclaire, an influential organ, suggesting
that the steps taken for the formation of
a society for the promotion of a Franco-
American alliance and proposing that ex-
Minister Leon Bourgeois De made presf
dent. Several informal meetings have
been held and a convention will be formed
shortly. The first public action will be
the convocation of a mass-meeting at the
end of autumn when society returns to
Paris from the country season. â¢ Â¦ ,
The feeling of French statesmen is not
very favorable to the idea of giving Japan
a mandate to quell the anarchy existing
in Northern China. There is not sufficient
confidence in the stability of Japan's civil
ization to entrust her with this mission,
and it is pointed out that anti-foreign
riots occasionally occur even in Japan.
Once installed at Peking, the Japanese
might be disposed to utilize their ad
vatapeous position to their own ends,
which may not be entirely consonant with
Western ideas.

STOPPED A DEER,
And the Reckless Act Nearly Cost a
Lumberman His Life.
Antolne Parent, a French-Canadian
logger, is now in the Oldtown Hospital,
slowly recovering from the effect of try
ing to catch and hold a frightened buck
deer. He will get well, but it was a close
call for him. One day lately the boss of
the camp on Tomhegan Stream, where
Antolne was employed, caught sight of a
200-pound- buck in the edge of the clear
ing, and. grabbing his rifle, shot- the ani
mal in the leg.: The buck went down, but
was soon up and racing madly around the
clearing on three legs. ' The boss never
thought to shoot again, but. dropping his
rifle, yelled to the crew, who were eating
their dinner: "Stop heem! stopheem!"
â¢The tables were deserted . In an Instant
and all hand3 made a rush for the buck.
Many of Uhem managed to get a grab at
him,, but that was allâ the. buck bowled

when it made its last stand, lighting in

cited my interest and I talked with them
on several occasions during the voyage.
It seemed that they had been living on
one of the ereat cattle ranches of the
northern veldt, forming one big household
with their women folk, and knew nothing
of the war until the order came to turn
out for active service. Of course, they
belonged to the local 'commando, or
militia department, for that section, but it
was not a regularly disciplined .organiza
tion and they had never even drilled to
gether. When the call came the father
and son responded first and joined
Cronje's army. Later on there was an
other requisition for troops and the grand
father shouldered his rifle and hurried to
the front. About the time Cronje started
on his last retreat the old great-grand
father got uneasy and set out to see how
'his boys. 1 as he called them, were get
ting alone. He arrived Just before the
final stand, and, once inside the laager, he
couldn't get out; so he took a gun from a
dead man and went to fighting along with
the rest of the family.
"The f<Â»Â«r Boers struck me as good,
honest, simple-minded men. They had
no Idea whatever of the causes of the
war, the principles involved or the relative
strength of the two sides. AH they knew
was that the 'rooineks' were trying to in
vade the republic and that Com Paul had
called on them to come out and fight. The
whole crowd were fatalists of the deepest
dye. They were prisoners of war on a
strange ship. Bailing away to a part of
the world as unknown to them as the
mountains of tha moon, but they accepted
the situation as stoically as so many
Turks. I asked the grandfather how he
thought it would all end. 'God knows, 1 he

I inquired. 'God knows,' he replied and

Their Love for Their Calves Shown
SOJME INSTINCTS OF COWS.
in Curious Ways.
Cattle are not merely gregarious â they
have an instinct of neighborliness and
comradeship almost human. Further,
mother-love among them persists long
alter the period of helplessness of the
calves. A cow knows her calves, licks
them and moos to them when they are
lull grown, with calves of their own. She
lows lamentation it they are Â¦ sent to a
separate pasture, and recognizes them
alter six months or even a year of sepa
ration; this, of course on the commons,
where normal instincts persist and even
strengthen. Stall feeding does not de
velop neart or mind in cattle any more
than in human beings.
Once at least tins continuing mother
love prevented bad blood between neigh
bors, with a possible suit at law. , Two
cows upon adjoining farms dropped with
in the same week calves so nearly alike
It would have puzled that traditionally
wise person, a .Philadelphia lawyer, to
know one from the other. They were
heifer calves, dun, with a white spot in
the forehead and the barest tip of white
in the tails. Dun was a rare color upon
the rang-e round about, so both the young
sters were looked at with interest. They
were weaned in the fall and turned out
next spring to lind their own living in the
natural b:ue grass meadows about the
creeks. .Food was abundant: the creeks
had also many windings, with here and
there in secluded places remnant fringes
of cane. The dun heifers throve so linely
and fell so in love with freedom that
they did not come home in the fall, as did
other well-conducted young cattle. Just
what they did do, indeed, was never
known. The spring when they were 2
years old one owner went looking for his
property and discovered a line, saucy
young cow, with a pretty frisky call at
loot, grazing happily ten miles away.
Neitner ytarlhig liad been marked be
fore turning ouu So the finder was
quite' justified In assuming that he had
lound his own and taking her home re
joicing. There his neighbor at once
claimed her, saying he knew her by a
peculiar indentation in the white star.
As the other dun was still missing there
wa3 room* for a very pretty quarrel, un
til it was agreed to let the old cows de
cide it. The three were turned together
in a pasture. At first both the old cows
looked askance at the young one, and
after a little made a rush at her as if
to bear her to her knees. But as they
got within three yards of the youngster,
who stood tossing her horns defiantly, tha
claimant's cow half wheeled, butted the
other in the flank, sent her reeling, sniffed
gently at the stray, then began to lick
her on the neck and brisket, just as she
licked her own new calf. The demonstra
tion was conclusive â the men shook
hands on it. and the stray dun went home
with her mother.
Whether from instinct or calculation,
cattle have a curiously accurate sense of
time. If they are salted every other
morning at a certain spot, they will be
prompt almost to the minute, though they
may not come near the place between
times. Dairy maids whose milkers run
out give them "a lick of salt" or meal,
as they say "to ha'nt 'em home." Hence
no doubt comes the cant rural proverb,
expressing mulish obstinacy: "I wouldn't
do it for a lick of salt."
Buck and Brandy were brindled oxen, a
yoke of renown throughout the country
fide. They had horns a yard from tip to
tip. intelligent, black-nosed, white-starred
faces, and beautiful bushy tails. Broken
together at a year old, they worked and
played and grazed side by side until they
were rising seven. Then Brandy, falling
lame, was turned out for a long rest, hla
o^-ner thinking to fatten and sell him in
the fall. Buck at once quit work. Yoked
to cart or plow, or ox-wagon, he simply
lay down. The goad could not move him.
As soon as he was free, though he had
never in his life tried, to jump a fence
or throw one down, he straightway made
a breach somewhere and went through It
to his comrade. As a result his owner
sold two stall fed oxen in place of one. In
death, as in life, the two were not di
vided.
The prodigal calf gets a rough reception
upon his home coming. The herd looks
him over at long range, bellows defiance
and scorn of him, then keeps on with its
own affairs. If the prodigal hangs mod
estly back, feeding upon the outskirts for
a day, or maybe a week, never obtrud
ing himself, and running from each low
ered head or brandished horn, he may in
the end be grudgingly accepted. But if
he comes boldly in, crowding for salt,
snatching at forage, answering bellows
with a low, disdainful moo, he must con
quer a peace or ffo to tho wall. At first
the herd leader rushes at him, but does
not gore him. If the stray stands up
stoutly, or (fives the leader a fair re-
Fistance, he may win out right there.
But If he is badly worsted, yet lacks the
sense to profit by defeat, and keep in

Atavism perhaps explains why cattle go
mad at the smell of bloodâ especially tne
blood yÂ£*their own spe.cies. Even a fresh
hide trailed across their feeding ground
mav make them dangerous. With lowered
hea'ds, tails stiilly extended, bellowing,
not loudly, but with a deep, menacing,
growling note, they charge compactly
upon almfcst any moving thing in sight,
particularly a human being on foot. It
is a charge not easily stayed, but readily
evadedâ it is hard for- a herd to check
itself, and harder still to turn square.
Circling, is however, another matter, so
if attacked it is the part of wisdom to
keep directly in front until the charge <s
almost upon you, then run out of the way
at a right angle.
Cattle are great pathmakers. For the
most part they go straight almost as the
crow flies, and always in Indian file, one
right on the heels of another. In every
pasture there is a leader, who chooses the
way. Commonly the leader is- the bell
cow, but if the bell bearer grows old and
weak she may be disregarded. Another
instinct, no doubt going back to the days
of wolf and bear ravages, is that which
makes them go to the same place to sleep
and choose that place on the highest
available ground. A new herd put into a
pasture will sleep in the old place. The
going to it is generally about dusk, except
in the height of summer and flytime.
when cattle graze all night and spend the
days in water or the thickets. Commonlj
the feoing is a slow, stately march, but

GIRL'S LONG WAIT

For a Young Man Who Went for a
A young couple from the country came
to town for the purpose of procuring a
marriage license. While the prospective
groom went fc,r a license he left the in
tended bride in a buggy on the market
square. At the Clerk's office he was told
that he would have to procure some one
to make oath that the young lady was of
age. Hour after hour passed while the
young man scoured tho town for a friend.
In the meantime people began wondering
why the young lady kept up her vigil In
the buggy. Finally, after a wait of six
hours, she was rewarded by the sight or
her lover, who had enlisted the good of
fices of some one in attesting to the
bride's age and carried with him the mar
riage license. They drove home late in
the afternoon, tired and embarrassed, but
happy. The couple were Grlflln Racy ana

To the Silver Republicans of the
United States: The Democratic National
Committee of 1900 has nominated William
J. Bryan for President and Adlai E. Stev
escoa for Vice President. The Silver Re
publican National Convention of 1900 has
nominated William J. Bryan for Presi
dent anti referred the matter of a cajidi
clate ior Vice President to its National
Committee with power to act. Your com
mittee had carefully considered the whole
matter. It met in conference with repre
sentatives of the Democratic and of the
people's party .National committees and
ui'iu over the" ground fully.
'Â¦Yeur committee found Itself face to
face with these facts: In liitS thousands
of voters who had heretofore voted the
Kepublican ticket found themselves so
videly-at variance with their parly's plat
form that they could not. without self-
Btultific&tlon, lur.gtr act with tlie Kepub
licoa party. In thr.t y>ar they found in
Um LÂ» t rno<-riitic candidate lor President
ei-j in the platform uixÂ»n which he stood
a compute and sufficient Justllication for
giving him their hearty support. With
tini they went down to defeat, but in that
tiefeat won a. victory for manhood and
patriotic independence. I for which they
r.ave ho apology to offer and in which
tliey feel a just pride. They retain and
preserve the right to vote as their judg
ment dictates. They bow to no party
bos=t and have not abdicated their right
to think.
In LStf the Republican party made a
prufour.d departure Jrom the traditions,
and interests of the American people and
of that party by rejecting the free coin
age of silver aior.g w;ih gold and placing
Itself in a position to adopt the gold
standard. This year it has declared itself
unreservedly for the pold standard. This
continues the controversy of lh*}. But in
addition to its departure from the advo
cacy of bimetallism it lias now still more
profoundly departed from the traditions
Â«ij)d interests of the American peojÂ»le by
becoming the apologist for and the cham
pion of iruEts and monopolies and has in
troduced euch imperialistic practices and
theories into the administration of af
fairs of government that for the first
time in the history of that party its na
tional convention could not even, refer to
the Declaration of InJepender.ee and this,
although its convention of 19W met in such.
6. place and within such an environment
that the great declaration would have
peculiarly api>ealed lo the party had it
Rtill listened to the voice that, in that
earlier and better day. pleaded for a gov
ernment "of the people, for the' people
and by the people." Jn the face of such
profound departures from the traditions
tind interests of the American people we
cartnot return to the Republican party.
On the oth'-r hand we lind the Dem
ocratic party has again placed itself right
on the money question, right on the ques
tion of trusts and monoplies, right as the
champion of the Declaration of Indepen
dence and of constitutional government,
right in expressing its sympathy for other
nations, who only ask "that which you
would that others should do unto you, do
even so unto them.
The Democratic candidate for President
Is curs; our convention named him. Up
on the fundamental propositions above
tlated. we are one with the Democratic
end thÂ«? People's" party. Our common can
didate for President is enlisted, heart and
soul, in this preat cause. We know he has
the high courage of his convictions. His
triumph is necessary', if we are To hand
<1-.v-n to our children and our children's
children, n government founded in the wis
dora of the fathers, maintained by the
t>Iood nnd treasure of its citizens and per
petuat^d as a priceless heritage.
Impelled by these considerations, your
KANSAS CITT. July 7.â The 'Demo
cratic national committee resumed Its ses
cicr.s to-day at the Kansas City Club.-
Representatives of the Populists and Sil
â¢ver Republicans attended the meeting.
Nearly every State in which the Populist
end Silver Republican strength is neces
tary to carry the State for the Democracy
eras pledged to Bryan and Stevenson. The
exceptions were Nebraska, Kansas and
South Dakota, representatives of these
States saying they thought it extremely
doubtful whether they could be carried
for Bryan unless a Populist should re
main in the l..eiti_ At the sarr.e time they
claimed they did not care to sacrifice Mr.
Tcwne and force him to become a Wat
ton, even on a smaller scale. Stress was
laid upon the danger of losing four Sen
ators in these three States. The Silver
Kepublica'is t:iid there would be no doubt
about carrying the mountain States, but
they had little hope of the Pacilic Coast.
Tne matter of running a third ticket
Â¦will be determined after a conference of
the leaders at Lincoln, aa it is understood
that they will meet Mr. Bryan there on
Monday.
Acting Chairman Edmiston. General
James li. Weaver and Thomas Patterson
spoke for the Populists, while Chairrr.an
'iillotson.. tx-Senator Dubois and Repre
sentative Shafroth spoke for the Silver
Kepuljlicans. All of the Silver Kepubll
car.s pledged their hearty support to the
Bryan and Stevenson ticket. The Popu
lists said they were earnestly in favor of
the election cf Bryan but pointed out the
difficulty of indorsing- this ticket by the
Populist coramltte'e without being placed
in the position of dictators of the part;-,
something that the Populists of Nebraska
and South Dakota would not stand.
SILVER REPUBLICANS
ISSUE A MANIFESTO
The Silver .Republicans presented the
names of Chairman TiUotson, Senator
Teller ar.d ex-Senator Dubois for repre
sentation on the Democratic executive
committee. The Populists did not present
<isy r.aroes for this committee, saying
that until they could confer with the
leaders in the various States they would
take no action. "
It was determined that addresses in the
Interest of the Bryan and Stevenson
ticket Â«hould be issued very soon by the
Democratic and Silver Republican parties,
to b<? followed later by an address frcm
the Populist party when it was ready to
act. Chairman Jones said that everything
ms working toward harmonious action
by all of the reform forces, and the indi
cations were that all parties would be
pulling together for the Bryan and Stev
enson ticket. The committee at 12:20 p.
m. adjourned sine die.
national committee has determined that
its duty in this hour is to indorse Hon.
Adlai K. Stevenson as our candidate for
the Vice Presidency, in order that the op
position to the gold standard, trusts, im
perialism and all its attendant evils, may
concentrate its vote at the danger point
and accomplish the triumph of those prin
ciples so dear to us. It is but simple
justice to Fay that in taking the action in
dicated we are following the advice of
our distinguished leader, Hon. Charles A.
Towne.
Let us express the hope that our friends
will lay aside whatever of disappointment
they may feel and join in a united effort
to secure the triumph of our principles at
the coming election.

KANSAS CITT, July 7.â The Income tax
was left out of the platform as adopted
by the convention and the attention of the
Democratic leaders was called to it early

the committee on resolutions, intended to
make a motion to have the income tax
provision inserted. He did not make the
motion, however, and it is not includpd in

STEVENSON'S SON
HEARS THE NEWS
LOS AN'GELES, July 7.â T.ouls G. Ste
venson, son of Adlai Stevenson, nomi
nated at Kansas City yesterday by the
Democrats for Vfce Pre?Ment, is in this
city. He is naturally elated over his
father's nomination, and pays that he
thinks his name on the ticket with Bryan
will have a conciliatory rffect in quarters
where Democratic factionalism might ba
encountered.
Hanna to Tarry in New Jersey.
NEW YORK, July 7.â Tlie Evening Post
Fays: Senator Hanna has arranged to
come to ElbTon. X. J., on July 20 and
take possession of in 5 Elboron Cottage of

â¢ LINCOLN. Neb., July 7.â The Question
whether W. J. Bryan is to' have one or
two running mates is expected to be set
tled at a conference that will be held at
his home to-morrow with Charles A.
Towne and other Democratic and Populist
leaders.
Charles A. Towne, George Fred Wil
liams. Joseph Daniels of North Carolina
and Willis J. Abbott â¢ reached Lincoln
about midnight. Mr. Bryan met them at
the train, but remained with them only
while being driven to their hotel. Mr.
Towne declined to be interviewed plead
ing weariness, and retired Immediately.
Whether Mr. Towne will remain until
Tuesday, when the Vice Presidential can
didate and Chairman Jones are to be here.
Is not known, but the presumption is tna:.
he will. Senator Blackburn is expected
that day to take part in the Democratic
ratification.
On the day following the three fusion
parties In Nebraska hold their State nom
inating* conventions and the Democratic
leaders will be urged to remain and ad
dress the delegates.
Mr. Bryan was very much provoked to
read to-day a fictitious interview with his
15 year old daughter. Ruth, who was at
tendin? the convention at Kansas City.
The purported interview is a lengthy one
and covers personal and public questions.
Mr. Bryan said that occasionally he was
misrepresented himself, as other public
men are, but he thought the children
ought to be spared. The interview, Mr.
Bryan said, was entirely without founda
tion.
Congressman Sulzer was one of to
night's arrivals from Kansas City. He
called on Mr. Bryan.
Montanans Visit Bryan.
The tide of Democrats has turned from
Kansas City to Lincoln and Mr. Bryan
expects many visitors during the next
few days. The influx began early to-day
when the Montana delegates stopped be
tween trains and -proceeded In a body to
the Bryan home, accompanied by a band.
Mr. Bryan was aroused and made a
speech in which he said he was greatly
fatigued from loss of sleep during the
session of the convention, as he ha-1
spent the greater part of the nights read
ing bulletins from the convention and had
remained up all night during the discus
sion over the platform. He apologized
for not having been at the depot to meet
the delegation, but he had supposed that
after the sessions of the convention that
the delegates would be just as tired as
he. Mr. Bryan asked for Senator Clark,
but was told that the Senator was not In
the party.
Following the Montana delegation there
was a steady procession to the homo of
Bryan. The greatest demonstration of
the day occurred this afternoon at 3
o'clock, when the Nebraska Traveling
Men's Bryan Club, which had Just return
ed from Kansas City, called on the can
didate. Mr. Bryan met It on the front
porch. H. B. Thompson, president of the
Club, read the following aidress:
Mr Bryan, Our Friend and Neighbor: We
havÂ»" just returned home from the National
Democratic Convention. Our party, constst
lmj of the Traveling Men's Club, the Bryan
Home Guards, Continental Guards and Hage
now's Band, desire to congratulate you upon
your nomination by the great united Democ-
b y ofÂ° tne 't^ t *&%S$J& t MS P y^
stand on Is all right; your running-mate Is
Kentucky born. He Is a smooth rider and he
is ill rlsht and you are all right. We take the
opportunity to assure you that you will find
us all In the front rank of the fight from this
dav until the close of the polls next November
Btandlng for you and Nebraska, and our reward
win come on the fourth day of March at your
inauguration at Washington, when we will
march down Pennsylvania avenue, headed by
Ha;enoW5 Band. Â¦
Mr.- Bryan was cheered as he began and
concluded his response. He said In part:
I am Klad to see you In such good spirits for
Besponse of the Nominee.
the flght which Is ahead. I am proud of yoa
and I am proud of the Nebraska people and I
am glad you went to Kansa* City, where others
might meet representative men and women of
our State. I congratulate the State as well aa
myself on the delegation of fifteen that went
to Kan?as City to represent us In the National
Democratic Convention. Ycu itmd as an ex
ample before the others. I have grown some
what tired of serving as a sample for so long.
I want to assure you that should the Demo
cratic candidate be th? one to be Jnausurat-Â»d
next March I shall refuse to allow the taauitu
ratton to proceed unless Hagenow's Band Is
there. I want to assure you that I would
rather have you. In your plain clothes, offi
ciate In my Inauguration than to have uni
formed soldiers. Not butthat a certain number
of soldiers are rlscht In their place, but the
resource of this nation Is her men who are will-
In? to work and fight between times.
No party ever adopted a platform better than
that adopted at Kansas City. It Is plain and
explicit on every subject. I have been In
formed by several gentlemen that thÂ« conven
tion was just like an old-fa.Â«hloned Methodist
camp-m?etln?. I believe, however, there wera
a few distln*uish!fi< characteristics, such as
the manifestation of enthusiasm by a Cakewalk
or a tlance.
Four years ago there were those who went
out from the convention to work against the
ticket, and this year the hall had to be en
la ryed to admit these who wanted to coma
back. All of this Indicates gocd for the party.
I wish to tell you that I expect Mr. Steven
son on Monday or Tuesday, and I want you
to meet him.
The meeting at Kansas CJty was full of en
thusiasm that means eood for thÂ« party, and
you all reflected credit on the people whom you
represented. In this campaign we have an
Issue, the principles of which lie at the basis
of our Government. Th-? flsht this 'year will
be to carry out the sentiment of that sonÂ« you
have often repeated. "My Country. 'Tls of
Thee." If we lose, our chtMren and our chil
dren's children will not succeed to the spirit
of that song; celebrations of the Fourth of
July will pa?s away, lor the spirit of empire
wil^ be u?on us.
t The Traveling: Men's Club was the last
visiting delegation of the day, the other
callers being Nebraska men of promlnenca
only in the State.

the street. Miss Roycroft bravely tried
to check the speed of the frightened
animal, but her efforts were futile. With
in a few blocks the buggy collided with a
tree, throwing the occupants to the
ground.
Miss Roycroft struck with her head
against a tree trunk, fracturing the skull
aiid crushing the chest bones. She was
carried unconscious to the nearest house.
Up to a late hour the young lady had not
regained coriBciousness. Physicians de
clare there are no hopes of her recovery!
Mrs. Roycroft was cut about the face
but not seriously Injured unless internal
Injuries exist, 'which It is feared may be
possible. Miss Corrigan escaped with a- few
scratches. Miss Roycroft is of a sweet
disposition, a social favorite In realms

FOUR MORE DEATHS

Intact.
NEW YORK, July 7.â The fire at the
Standard Oil Â¦ Company^} works at Bay
onn<\ N. J., which started shortly after
midnight on' Thursday morning, is rapidly
burning itself out. The best evidence
that the fire is about at an end and that
the danger of a still further spreading of
the flames Is not feared is that a number
of the fire companies allowed to re
turn to their quarters this morning.
Of the twenty-four large tanks in the
company's new plant, where the fire has
been raging, four remain intact.
Prunes Are Dropping.
SAN JOSE, July 7. â Reports were made
at the meeting of the San Jose Grange to
day that prunes are dropping badly. This
is especially true of orchards which have
been irrigated irregularly. Orchards which
have never been irrigated suffer less than
ai;y others, provided they have been thor
oughly cultivated. The reason for this is
given in the statement that In orchards
where there ls r.o irrigation the "feeder"
roots go deep ln search of moisture. In
irrigated orchards they con%e toward the
surface, and irrigation must be, regular
and continued or the fruit drops.

VENABLE GIVES DAMAGING
EVIDENCE AGAINST GREEN
Hearing in the Proceedings for the
Removal of the Savannah Har
bor ' Contractors.
NEW YORK, July 7.â The hearing in
the proceedings looking toward the
removal of Benjamin M. Green, John
P. Gaynor, W. F. Gaynor and E. H.
Gaynor, the Savannah Harbor contrac
tors, was continued to-day before United
States Commissioner Shields.
William B. Venable, a granite contrac-
tor of Atlanta. Ga., who 'testified yester
day, was called to "the stand. The wit
ness paid that on the morning when the
contracts were let he had been asked by
Mr. Gaynor to state the terms of his bid
This he had declined to give, as he did
not wish to be a party to "any such com
bination."
He further said, that Mr. Green told
him he had in his possession duplicate
copies of a. bid $:Â»O,OO0 lower ttian that
actually made by the Atlantic company.
This, he said, was ready to be entered in
case any other concern should cut under
the first bid. Witness said he had spent
much money preparing to deliver 3oO,000
tons of stone he had contracted to fur
nish. As a matter of fact, he delivered
only about $100,000' worth of stone. As
sistant United States District Attorney
Irwin explained that Captain Carter
changed the specifications. The case was
then adjourned until Monday next.
FIRE AT BAYONNE IS

O. L. SPAULDINO, ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF TREASURY.
SAX FRANCISCO ls honored by the presence of O. L. Spauldlnjr. Assistant
Secretary of the Treasury of the United States. He ls stopping at the
Palace, and Is certainly not looking for notoriety. Many officers of the
customs service called to see the gentleman yesterday afternoon and pay
their respects, but failed to meet him. The presence of so many of the local offi
cers of the Government ln the hostelry created the rumor that there was some
mystery connected with the visit of Mr. Spaulding. This thought was. however,
soon dispelled by that gentleman.
"There is no mystery connected with my visit to this coast at this time,"
said Mr. Spaulding yesterday afternoon. "It la true that my trip is for the
purpose of securing information, but it is also a pleasure, for it gives my wife
and self an opportunity to meet our son, Lieutenant Spaulding, Tvho is in the
Third Artillery, stationed at Fort Wlnfield Scott.
"I will proceed from here to the Sound ports. looking through the customs
system, and from there I will go to the far north. My business there will be
to look into the methods now pursued ln the handling of goods bound for ports
in' Alaska. At a distance of thousands of miles it is sometimes difficult to un
derstand situations, and it is for the purpose of placing the Treasury Depart
ment in touch with northern conditions that I am here. The transportation of
goods in bond through Canadian territory and matters pertaining to the bonded
warehousing of merchandise in a manner satisfactory to all parties concerned will
occupy my attention, and when I return to "Washington I hope to be able to
recommend some regulations that will be acceptable. It ls not intended that my
trip shall extend beyond Skaguay, and I expect to be back ln San Francisco in
about six weeks, en route to Washington. There are no investigations to be
made, ln the common acceptance of the term. I am simply golns to obtain some
personal knowledge that will be of great assistance ln making improvements
in the service for the benefit of the general public."
Those interested in the immense traffic with tha northern mines will hear
of the coming of this high official with particular satisfaction, as there arc sev
eral serious and many mfnor evils that require correction. The acts of the Ca
nadian officials have been in many instances arbitrary and unjust to miners and
merchants, and It is believed that their seriousness is responsible for the long
and trying trip that has been undertaken by the Assistant Secretary of the
Treasury. Mr. Spaulding Is one of the handsomest and most genial gentlemen
who ever came here officially from the seat of Government.

He was engaged in prospecting* for oil
In the new California oil Holds. No cause

Mr. Leroy was a passenger from San
Francisco to Chicago and occupied berth
No. 13 in one of the middle sleepers. His
actions were not particularly noticed by
the passengers and he gave no indications
that he contemplated taking his life.
This morning he arose and dressed and
spoke pleasantly to several persons sit
ting near him. Just as the train passed
Patterson station Leroy took an envelope
out of his pocket and was seen to write
on the back ot it. The writing finished
he put it In his pocket again. Then, with
out warning, he drew a 41-caliber re
volver, placed it at his right temple and
fired.
The man fell forward and before any
one could reach him he was dead.
In his pockets were found, besides a
bunch of letters, a watch and $35 90.
The body was embalmed and will be
held to await word from his relatives.
LOS ANGELES, July 7,-Charles Leroy,
SG years of age, of Fullerton, who com
mitted suicide on the Santa Fe train,
was an oil driller for the Puente Oil Com
pany at Fullerton. He left home four days
ago to go East on a visit to relatives. No
cause ls known for his actions, as his do
mestic relations were pleasant. He leaves
a wife and two small sons. He was con
sidered a safe and reliable employe. The
widow has asked that the body be sent
here, and says temporary Insanity alone
can account for the rash act.

day's Great Western handicap, with Sid
ney Lucas second and Barrack third.
Sidney Lucas was conceding twenty
pounds to the winner and was beaten only
a length. Lieutenant Gibson, which was
an added starter, was made favorite at
2 to 1, Sidney Lucas was second choice
and Pink Coat third choice ln the betting.
Boney Boy went out to set the pace,
attended soon by Lieutenant Gib
son. This pair ran the first three
quarters three lengths ahead of the
others. Entering the back Btretch
Boney Boy retired. Lieutenant Glb
pon then "assumed command, but Sid
ney Lucas, Pink Coat and Jolly Roger
closed on him and the pace along the
back stretch was a killing one. After
racing with Lieutenant Gibson until the
turn for home Jolly Roger compelled the
Derby favorite to quit. In the run for
home Pink Coat tired. In the stretch Sid
ney Lucas made a determined effort to
catch Jolly Roser. but It was asking too
much and the pair reached the finish Jlne

FREE SILVER PLANK
DISAPPOINTS CLEVELAND
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BUZZARDS BAT, July 7.â Former Pres
ident Cleveland to-night expressed bis
opinion on the Democratic platform.
"I most ardently hoped and desired," he
paid, "that the platform to be constructed
at Kansas City would be consistent with
the professions of those In charge of the
Democratic management, that the har
monizing of the discordant sentiment ln
the party was an object of supreme Im
portance. In these circumstances the In
corporation of a specific demand for free
silver at the ratio of 16 to 1 Is. of course,
a great surprise and disappointment."
The flre had its origin in the basement
of E. G. Evans & Co.'s china and glass
ware establishment on Fifth avenue, be
tween Wood and Market streets. The
dense smoke from burning excelsior and
other material used ln packing china baf
fled the firemen for a long time, but after
lighting for more than an hour they got
the upper hand, though the building was
deluged with water.
At about 5:9) p. m., when all danger
seemed to have passed, ten members of
engine companies Nos. 4 and 11 were
working on the second floor, knee deep
in water. The weight of water, with the
already heavy weight on the floor ln the
ehape of the big Jeweler's safes of God
dard. Hill & Co., was too much and the
floor gave way. In its. plunge down it
drapged the third floor along with it
clear through to the cellar. Â¦ - --â¢-'-
The firemen were burled deep under the
debris and it was believed at first that
none would escape. Heroic efforts were
made by the remaining firemen to rescue
their comrades, and ln a little while they
could be conversed with, but they were
still pinned down by the masses of debris.
To rescue Captain Campbell a jack was
pushed forward and jacks were required
to raise : a large portion of the " broken
floor. .He was under the.floor two, hours,
yet he was the least injured of any taken
The injured: Captain Dan Campbell,
Stewart Burns, Edward Kearney, Wil
liam Erb, George Munn and William da
Rile.

Thp survivors of the wreck were picked

According to the testimony of several
Â«ail#rs. the topsail, mainsail' and jibsail
wer*> all sr>t when the squall came. This
is dr-ni<Â»d by the male, who declared they
were in prw>rl shape to fare the storm.

THE MILLER COMPANY
IN POWDER AND PATCHES
VESTERDAT was the people's day
among the pictures at the . Mark
II Hopkins Institute of Art and the
gallery was crowded, as usual.
It cannot be too well known that the
only gallery San Francisco possesses Is
open to the public on the first Friday In
each monthâ twelve times a year, that Is
â"free, gratis, for nothing." A dozen
times a year the picture hungry popu
lace may glut themselves upon the old
masters and mistresses up at "the Hop
kins" for a whole afternoon. If they have
the necessary leisure.
"Free Friday" is always appreciated to
the extent of from 1000 to almost 4000 vis
itors, and if every Friday were free there
is good reason to believe that the same
number of people would attend weekly.
This month's changes In the gallery
are, principally, the resurrection from
the billiard room below stairs of a couple
large Thomas Hills, now placed in the
new exhibition room, an unimportant but
pretentious, botanical arrangement by
Meyer Straus and a new picture by R. D.
f n a "April Showers" Is seen Mr. Tel
land's latest manner, in- which the last
five years has seen such remarkable
change:- "April Showers" Is one of the
best pictures that has yet come from the
clever brush of this painter; worthy In
subject, happy In composition, clean and
fresh in color, and treated In a free, un
labored fashion. Â»
More than a thousand visitors saw tno
pictures yesterday. ;

There are reasons to believe the Morocco problem
is now engaging the attention of the Governments of
the three powers, and that it will be brought up for
settlement before long. Spain has now hardly any
colonies left and would gladly take over the whole of
this bone of contention rather than to have the French
and British fight about it. Nobody appears ready to
champion the right of the Moors to 'independence.
The only question is that of a division of the spoils,
and consequently when the war clouds" on the horizon
are being noted, that hanging over Morocco must be
counted in.
Wherever there is a controversy there is always
somebody around with a suggestion of compromise.
In the present case the suggesters have a plan which if
carried out will give something to everybody con
cerned except the Moors. The plan is to give Great
Britain a port opposite Gibraltar, to give Spain all
the remainder of the Morocco coast line with a terrU
tory running^ back to a distance to be agreed upon
hereafter, while the bulk of the country is to be turned
over to France, to be controlled, cultivated and civil
ized. /
The present disturbance is the outgrowth of a
French railway enterprise^. The road has' been ex
tended into a district which the Moors claim to be
theirs. The claim could be very easily settled by
France if Spain and Great Britain would give her a
free hand. Morocco would be promptly annexed as
a French province and then the railway projectors
would have no more trouble. As it is, there has been
much trouble. The. Moors have been fighting and
rioting and threatening war, and France has had to
exercise a good- deal of diplomacy to keep the peace
until after the exposition is over.
Morocco is one of those decadent states whose
proximity to civilized nations renders their decay a
matter of moment to the world at large. It adjoins
the possessions of France in Algiers and in the Sa
hara. It is opposite the coast of Spain and has long
been coveted by that power. It is separated from
Gibraltar T>y a narrow channel and a portion of it has
been under the watchful eye of Great Britain for a
long time. Thus three nations are standing around
waiting forVi opportunity to take up the white man's
burden in Morocco, and the prospects are there will
be a crisis there before long which will compel one
among them, if not all three, to take action.
HE who would keep watch upon all the danger
points of the world just now must not overlook
Morocco. War is not raging there as in South
Africa, nor is there any widespread insurrection and
fighting, as in China. Neither is the situation like that
in the Philippines. Nevertheless, there is a problem
in Morocco and the forces now trying to solve it may
have a fight over it before this time next year.
THE MOROCCO PROBLEM.
At this time Pope was almost Insanely
in love with another's man's wife. Lady
Mary Wortley Montagu, and, while her
husband was Minister to Constantinople,
Pope wrote her letters that were mad, If
not maddening. He said to her:
"There is not a day in which your figure
does not appear before me, your conversa
tion return to my thoughts, and every
scene, place or action where I have en-
Joyed them are as livellly painted as an
imagination equally warm and tender can
be capable to represent them."
Most of the love letters that have come
down to us in literary history are written
in sadness by lovers whose recompense
has been denied to them. Take one, for
example, the last that was written by
Farquhar, the playwright, to Mrs. Old
field, the actress. Mrs. Oldfleld had played
fast and loose with his passion for years.
In the end she coldlj- chose another and a
wealthier alliance. This Is Mb letter:
"Madam: 'Tls a sad misfortune to be
gin a letter with an adieu. If there be
that man upon earth that can merit your
esteem I pity himâ for an obligation too
great for a return must, to any generous
goul, be very uneasyâ though I still envy
his misery. May you be as happy,
madam, in the enjoyment of your desire,
as I am miserable in the disappointment
of mine; and, as the greatest blessing of
"You are to understand, madam, that
my passion for your fair self and sister
has been divided with the most wonder
ful regularity in the world. Even from
Infancy I have been in love with one after
the other of you, week by week. â¢ â¢ â¢
This Information will account for my
writing to either of you hereafter, as
either shall happen to be queen regnaut
at that time.
He begins the following letter to Ther
esa Blount, Bister of Martha, his other
sweetheart, by professing love for both
in these words:
surance not only to fall in love
and write love letters, but to fall in love
with three women at once, and to write
to all of them at the same time. Worse
still, two of the three were sisters, and
are supposed to have compared notes.
SV-* OST of the great writers of Eng
f|| llsh have been great writers of
111 love letters. Even Alexander
I*! Pope, little, weazened, deformed
' \ manikin that he was, had the as-
Fnvi e Â«, th i? n a "ythlng else how Intense a
loye of beauty he meant to express by
this line. In one letter he says:

In another letter he says:
"All I can bring you 1 3 a swooning ad
miration of your beauty. â¢ â¢ â¢ I have
two luxuries to brood over in my walkV

Richard Steele'3 letter? had a genuine
ring of love In them. Here Is one writ
ten to Mary Scurloek:
"With what language shall I address
my lovely fair, to acquaint her with the
sentiments of a heart she delights to tor
ture? I have not a minute's quiet out of
your sight, and when I am with you. you
use me with so much distance that I am
still in a state of absence, brightened
with a view of the charms which I am de
nied to approach. In a word, you must
give me either a fan, a mask or a glove
~j'ou have worn, or I cannot live. Other
wise you must expect that I will kiss your
hand, or, when I next sit by you, steal
your handkerchief. You yourself are too
great a bounty to be received at once.
Therefore I must' ba prepared by degrees
lest the mighty gift distract me with
joy."
In another letter he says:
"It is the hardest thing in the world to
be in love and yet attend to business. As
for me, all who speak to me find It out.
and I must lock myself up or other peo
ple will do It for me. A gentleman asked
me this morning, 'What news from Lis
bon?' I answered, 'She is exquisitely
handsome.' "
L.ove did not die during the honeymoon
for long after she became his wife Steele
wrote:
"Dear Prueâ I write in obedience to
what you ordered me. But there are not
words to express the tenderness I have
for you. Love is too harsh a word for it:
but if you knew how my heart aches when
you speak an unkind word to me, and
springs with joy when you smile upon
me. I am sure you would place your glory
rather in preserving my happiness like a
good wife than tormenting me like a pee
vish beauty. Good Prue. write me word
you shall be overjoyed at my return to
you, and pity the awkward figure I make
when I pretend to resist you by eomplv
ing always with the reasonable demands
of your enamored husband.
"RICHARD STBEL.E."
Here is another:
"Dear Prueâ I am very sleepy and tired,
but cannot think of closing my eyes till I
have told you I am, dearest creature,
your most tender and affectionate' hus
band. RICHARD STEELE."
Keats' greatest line, as everybody
kno*ws. was the oft-quoted one:
"A thing of beauty is a joy forever."
His letters to Fanny. Brawne indicated
Those are the tickets the people may consider for
amusement and curiosity, for on June 9 there as
sembled at Philadelphia a convention representing
American prosperity and patriotism. It nominated
McKinley and Roosevelt. That is the ticket to stay
by and vote for. It is the one that ought to win and
will win.
On May 9 the Middle-of-the-Roaders met at Cin
cinnati and confirmed the nominations made at a pre
vious convention last fall, thus putting into the field

same day the fusion Populists met at Sioux Falls and
nominated Bryan and Towne. That ticket is already
gone, Bryan having been taken by the Democrats and
Mr. Towne when last seen was on a toboggan slide.
On June 28 the Prohibitionists met at Chicago and
nominated J. G. Woolley for President and H. B.
Metcalf for Vice President, thus giving Woolley an
equal show with Harriman.
On Mayday, while the people generally were on the
picnic grounds frolicking in jocund exuberance over
the return of gentle spring, there assembled at Rock
Island a convention representing the "United Chris
tian party." It nominated Rev. S. C. Swallow of
Pennsylvania for President and John G? Woolley of
Illinois for Vice President. This coincidence of a
swallow coming in with the spring may be more for
tunate than the programme for putting up Bryan on
the Fourth of July. It will at least bceak an old
proverb, for no one ran hereafter say that one swal
low did not make a spring â at the Presidency.
Should neither of .those tickets satisfy the demand
there is still another of the social kind to be consid
ered. Last May a convention of what are known as
"De Leon Socialists" was held in New York City
and Joseph F. Maloney of Massachusetts was nomi
nated for President, with Valentine Remmill of Penn
sylvania for Vice President. Whether there will be
any further socialist nominations made is not certain,
but as there are one or two socialists who have not
been nominated for anything yet, it is quite possible
they may meet and draw straws for head and tail of
another ticket.
Up to date the nominations stand thus: The So
cialist Labor party last January nominated Job Har
riman of California for President and Max S. Hayes
of Ohio for Vice President. That ticket was not suf
ficiently radical for some of the elements that were
expected to support it, and accordingly they met at
Indianapolis in" March and under the title "Social
Democrats" nominated Eugene V. Debs of .Indiana
for President and Harriman for Vice President. Later
on efforts were made to harmonize the two parties
and bring about a union, but it does not appear that
a harmqpized ticket has been put forth; so the two
stand, and Mr. Harriman of California has a chance
to be elected President on one ticket or Vice Presi
dent on the other, as the people may choose.
ALTHOUGH the Popu1is#^and the Silver Re
publicans have fused completely with the
Democrats this year, and thereby put into the
field only one ticket where there should have been
three, the citizen who likes a variety to choose from
has no reason to be discontented with the situation.
There are already plenty of tickets in the field to sat
isfy a diversity of tastes, even should the Gold Dem
ocrats decide not to nominate any successor to the
gallant old ticket of Palmer and Buckner.

THE CHINESE CRISIS.
THE news of slaughter at Peking introduces the
acute stage of the Chinese question. It is time
for China and the United States to face the facts
involved in' their relations. The other nations con
cerned, with the possible exception of Great Britain,
i will pass the fiery cross and make ready for war and
I conquest. They want to make an end of the Chinese
Â¦ polity. They want to destroy a Government that was
I old before the races that compose their population
had been on earth. The provocation for this is found,
ready at hand, in the fearful events in Peking. These
are to the rest of the world what the destruction of the
I Maine was to the United States. Treaties have been
j violated and acts have been committed which Govem
i merits are expected to prevent and not connive at-
As far as our relations are concerned, China and
the United States have learned that, while Govern
ments may make treaties, they are worthless unless the
people observe them faithfully. Americans should
cultivate tolerance of spirit and not begin nagging
their Government into war, as they did in the Maine
affair. The people of this country have not observed
our various treaties with China. The prejudice of
race among us is stronger than the obligations of na
tional honor. We don't like the Chinese, and we for
bid their presence in certain places under penalty of
death. That penalty has been enforced in California.
Wyoming and Colorado. Yet in each place where
Chinese have been killed or have been forbidden to
come their treaty rights run, and under our agreement
with China they have the right to be there and to be
protected. We don't keep the agreement, and the
people of China violate it also. We are not unmind
ful of the exceeding gravity of the slaughter of a for
eign Minister in the country to which he is accred
ited. Yet diplomatic representatives have been assas
sinated before, and in Europe, so that an old chapter
in history is simply being extended, and a new one
is not being written. We kill coolies, but there are
circumstances under which an American mob would
not distinguish between a Chinese coolie and a Chi
urse Minister or Consul. The Chinese mob has re
fused to distinguish one foreigner from another, and
has murdered Ministers and missionaries, impartially.
We can afford to use our power, therefore, to prevent
what the other nations want to do in China. They
are not cast down by what has happened, for it is
nothing to them, one member of their diplomatic
corps, more or less, compared to satisfying their rage
for conquest and territory. \
The United States can afford to speak in the voice
of reason, and with deliberation. China owes indem
nity to the nations and must be compelled to pay it,
even at the cost of a war waged by all the Govern
ments concerned, including our own. But the pur
pose of such war must be agreed in the beginning,
and that agreement must be kept. The Chinese polity
must not be disturbed. Its administration may be re
formed, under guarantees exacted by the allied na
tions, but in those guarantees the rights of China must
be respected. '
Let it be understood now that we cease to expect
for Americans in China any different treatment than
that we give to Chinese in America. Let this prin
ciple govern the other nations. Also, let it be under
stood that the secular Governments of the world have
110 right whatever to put their power into what is
called the evangelizing of China. That scheme is pre
posterous. The different sects of the Christian church
have fought each other ever since the feud of Arius
and Athanasius. The lives sacrificed in these dis
putes run into the millions. Now, since the different
sects of Christianity are not able to agree among
themselves, why should they expect secular protec
tion in carrying their disagreements to the people
called pagan? That part of the situation in thÂ« East
is exasperating. The Chinese know that there is one
kind of Buddhism, and one kind of Taoism, and one
kind of Confucianism. They know also, historically
and by current experience, that these were propa
gated among them, not by attacking each other, but
by each presenting its own merits as the rule of life
and guide to conduct. They fail to comprehend why
many varieties of Christianity come among them, at
tacking each other and all attacking the placid and
peaceful religions and philosophies long domesticated
among them.
The situation enforces the wisdom of confining the
relations of secular Governments to secular affairs
entirely, and keeping them out of the spiritual mat
ters of the people. Had this been practiced in China
the Boxers would not have banded together, the for
eign legations would not have been murdered and
war would not have been turned loose.
THE FIGHT FOR PROSPERITY.
BY the action taken at Kansas City all the ele
ments of discontent in the country have been
virtually united in opposition to the Republi
can partj'. its candidates and its policies. It is true
there are several other tickets representing small
bodies of the people in the field, but these will have lit
tle or no effect on the result. The fight is that of the
party of prosperity against a combination whose
power is formidable, and it behooves Republicans and
z\\ voters who have a. stake in the business welfare of
the country to avoid the folly of underrating the
Etrcr.gth of the opposition. It is no easy victory that
awaits. There must be unity, energy and organiza
tion on the side of the supporters of Republicanism
to combat the banded forces of discontent.
The fight is going to be waged in California by
the Bryanites with a zeal that will show no flagging
from start to finish. No prospect of .success is to be
*cen by them in any of the States east of the
Alleghanies, and consequently their main efforts will
be made to carry the States of the Mississippi Valley
ar.d of the Great West. Here then is to be the scene
cf the hardest part of the struggle. Every resource of
Bryanism will be exerted to carry California for
Eryan electors and for Bryan candidates for Congress.
These efforts can be baffled and beaten if the Repub
licans do their iull duty, but not otherwise. The
party at this juncture cannot spare from the ranks of
its workers a single man capable of combating dis
content and exerting a helpful influence on the side
of prosperity and good government.
To the Republicans of San Francisco the issue is
cne of especial importance. Republicanism in this
city is confronted by the double menace of vigorous
foes on the outside and corrupt bosses from the gin
mills seeking to obtain power within. Both dangers
rr.U5t be squarely met and firmly faced. Every good
Republican should take part in the organizations of
the party and do earnest work for the victory which is
Â«o essential to national welfare.
The supreme issue is the preservation of the exist
ing prosperity of the people. The menace of Bryan
ism is the most portentous that has threatened the
republic since the outbreak of secession in i860. It
represents every faction of industrial, commercial and
financial discontent. It aims a blow at every indus
try, every trade, every contract It does more and
Â¦worse. It assails the financial honor of the nation it
celf, and if successful would bring upon the country
a calamity so appalling that the worst days of the
panic and depression brought about by the free trade
tariff would $cem like good times by comparison.
No intelligent observer can doubt that the con
tinuance of prosperity is dependent upon the con
tinuance in office of the party whose policies have
built up prosperity. The people who are opposed to
the administration are opposed also to the'protective
tariff, to sound money, to the impartial enforcement
of law, and to the whole well ordered system of gov
ernment that has brought tht- prosperity of this year
out of the evil conditions that prevailed in 1896. A
change in the government of the republic by the sub
stitution of Bryan for McKinley would mean disas
ters to every interest and ruin to thousands of now
prosperous people.
This is no time to take chances. It is no time for
any good citizen to give all his energies to his private
business and leave others to attend to public duties.
I*, is no time to indulge a feeling of. indifference as to
the outcome of the contest. The. danger is imminent.
Action is imperative. The nation, expects California
to support McKinley, and California counts upon
every Republican in her borders to do a true and
loyal citizen's full share in saving her and the nation
from the threatened blight of Bryamsm.
The voters of Alameda County arc presenting a
curious monopoly. Nearly all of them enjoy. thor
oughly a political scrap, and more than half of them
are in danger of being disfranchised because of their
neglect to register. v
THE COAST ROAD GAP.
1 \EPORTS that the gap in the coast line of the
Iâ J Southern Pacific road, between Surf and Ell
* . wood, will be soon completed will be received
by the public with -something of hopefulness and
much of incredulity. It has been years and years
since the company obtained rights of way across the
gap, under a promise of constructing the road "at
once." During that time the promise has been re
peated about twice every year. Each winter has
brought an assurance that the line would be open
"next fall," and each summer has been warmed by
assertions that it would be completed "next spring."
As a result of these repeated promises and disappoint
ments there was at one time a very interesting dis
cussion between one of the gentlemen who had given
liberally for. the right of way and Mr. Huntington,
and it was then stated by Mr. Huntington that he was
eager to complete the line and would do so about as
soon as his partners would let him. Now the part
ners are out, and the promise of speedy completion
comes forward promptly. u
Despite the disappointments of the past there are
good reasons for believing that at last the expecta
tions of the public arc to be realized. Reports state
that the tracks laid southerly from Surf and north
erly from Ellwood are now only fifteen miles apart.
It can hardly take even Mr. Huntington a year to lay
that much of track for the benefit of California. In
fact, it is stated that the present rate of construction
is such the completion of the line may be expected
*vithin sixty days. Our reports of yesterday add:
â¢;The equipment department is prepared to do its
share in opening up the new line, -and unless there
should be some unforeseen delay in starting the trains,
due to managerial policy,. the people of Santa Bar
bara should be afforded the long-deferred opportun
ity to hold the great railroad celebration in a few
weeks. It has long been intended that this jubilee
shall be one of the greatest ever held in the State."
The importance of the opening of the coast road
Is such as to merit the grandest celebration the peo
ple of Santa Barbara and the coast counties generally
may give it. The fact that it will provide a shorter,
quicker and pleasanter route from San Francisco to
Los Angeles is itself a matter of no little moment,
but that is by no means the main advantage that will
result. San Francisco and Los Angeles have man
aged to get along without the road and could con
tinue to do so. Its. chief value lies in the fact that it
ojjens' up the coast counties to through travel, and
With the opening of that through line the attention
of the State will be next directed to the need of a
line along the northern coast to open up the rich
territory around Humboldt. There is a chance for
something like a boom in tltat country as soon as an
adequate railway transportation is. provided. Such
a line is needed in the railway system of the State,
and it is reasonable to expect it will be provided in the
near future.
will greatly promote their development along all lines
of industry for which they are adapted. The benefits
resulting arc sure to be great, and the whole State
will profit by them.

Dumas Pere: His Dramatic Life and Work
Bv L. Du Pont Syle.
DUMAS pere is known to most peo
ple only as the author of the 232 vol
umes of romance that include "The
Count of Monte Cristo." "The
Three Musketeers" and their miles
of sequel. Yet this enormous mass repre
sents only a portionâ the largest, it is
trueâ of Dumas' activity. He is 1 also the
author of no less than twenty-five vol
umes of dramatic pieces, the best of
which, "Un Mariage Sous Louis XV."
will be presented at the Columbia Theater
to-morrow night "in a version by Sidney
Grundy entitled "A Marriage of Conven
ience." In this connection it may be not
uninteresting to give some little account
of Dumas' life and work up to the time
he produced this comedy -(1S41).
The grandfather of Alexander Dumas
was a French Marquis, his grandmother
a Santo Domingo negress. His father,
commonly known as General Dumas, dis
tinguished himself In the Austrian cam
paign of 1798 and wan presented to the
Directory by Napoleon as "the Horatius
Codes of the Tyrol." But his ardent re
publicanism lost him the favor of the
First Consul, who would give him no com
mand and even allowed him to die In pov
erty (1S07).
Alexander Dumas (born In 1S03) would
nothing of books in his youth and at 20
found himself possessed of little but the
regard of two or three old friends of his
father's, a fine physique and a good hand
writing. <These qualifications were suffi
cient to procure him a clerkship of $240 a
year in the bureau of the Due d'Orleans.
His days he spent in copying letters and
a large portion of his nights In removing
those deficiencies in his education of
which he had tardily become thoroughly
ashamed. "It was divine, these feverish
vigils," he tells us In his "Memoirs," "that
I acquired the habit (never lost) of night
work, which renders my labors incompre
hensible to my friends, for they cannot
guess at what hour nor In what time
I accomplish my toil. This interior life,
which escaped all notice, lasted three
years without leading to any result. I
produced nothing; I felt no need to pro
duce. I followed with a certain curiosity
the theatrical works of the day, in their
failures or in their successes, but as I
sympathized neither with the dramatic
construction nor with the dialogue of this
kind of work I felt dimply incapable of
producing anything like it without know
ing that anything else existed. About this
time some English actors arrived in Paris.
I -had never read a single piece of a for
rign dramatic literature. They announced
'Hamlet'; I knew only that of Duels; I
went to see Shakespeare's. Suppose a blind
rr.a*n to whom sight has been restored,
who discovers a world of which he had no
conception; suppose Adam awaking after
his creation. . . . Oh, that's what I was
looking for."
Dumas' dramatic Instinct, thus aroused,
sought expression, not In a tragedy as he
would have liked, but in a vaudeville, as
his lack of pence compelled. The first piece
he had acepted (Theatre de l'Ambigu, 1825)
was entitled "La Chasse et l'Amour." For
this he received the magnificent royalty
of SO cents per night, a similar sum go
ing to each of his collaborateurs, Leuven
and Rousseau.- Encouraged by this suc
cess, he wrote another vaudeville, "La
Noce et l'Enterrement" (with Vulpian and
Lassagne). for which he received $1 20 per
night. On the strength of this he sent for
his mother to come up from the country
and keep house for him while he plunged
into the compositon of a tragedy, "Chris
tine." This was scornfully "turned down"
by the Comedis Francaise. Nothing dis
couraged, Dumas went to work on another
tragedy, "Henri III." This' was completed
within two months and accepted. The
classicists bitterly opposed the production
of the play, and even petitioned the King
against it. He refused to interfere, and
under the patronage of the Due d'Orleans,
afterward Louis Philippe, "Henri III"
was given at the Francaise, February' 10i
1S29. It was a great success. Dumas re
ceived JGOOO in royalties and was appointed
librarian to the Due d'Orleans. Made gid
dy by his sudden passage from obscurity
to glory, he plunged with ardor into an
astounding luxury; he wore fantastic coats
and dazzling waistcoats, rode horses to
death and gave dinners worthy of Sar
danapalus.
Though not known at the time. It is now
pretty well recognized that "Henri III" Is
little more than a skulful compilation from
Schiller ("Don Carlos"), Scott, Anquetll
i and Pierre de l'Estoile.
"Christine" was now given, with mod
erate success, at the Odeon, and was fol
lowed in 1S31 by "Antony." Into this piece
Dumas has evidently put more of his per
scnallty than into any other. M. Lomenie.
parodying a speech of Mirabeau to the
King, says very neatly that in "Antony"'
there is too much vice for so much virtue,
and too much virtue for so much vice. At
short Intervals followed "Napoleon Bona
parte." "Arlington." "Teresa." "Angele"
and "La Tour tie Nesle"â to mention only
a few of the more prominent. Dumas' dra
matic career is said to have closed with
a little group of comedies which he wrote
i in his intellectual maturity, when long
I practice had made him a master in stase
! craft, so far as it was understood in h's
time. The group comprises "Mademoselle
de Belle-Isle." "Les Demoiselles de Salnt-
Cyr" and "X'n Mariage Soua Louis XV"
(1S41). In 1S45 appeared "Les Trol3 Mous
quetaires." The success of this wa3 s^
great that It destroyed Dumas as a dra
matic writer.
â¢ â¢ â¢
For the. information in this article T
am largely indebted to Victor Rosenwaid
and Larousse. I cannot close it better
than by translating: from the Revue dts
Deux-Mondes a portion of a sketch of Du
mas referred to by the latter. The autfcor
of this sketch is unknown, but he must
have been some contemporary who stood
close to Dumas and studied him narrowly:
"M. Dumas is one of the most curious
expressions of our age. Passionate by
temperament, artificial by instinct, cour
ageous from vanity, .good-hearted, not a
strong reasoner, improvident, he is well
nigh an Anthony for love, a Richard for
ambition, but he will never be a Sentln^tll

when he talks,- negro by origin and
French by birth, he Is cool even wht>n

j greedy in his quality of artist, generous
! because he is artist and poet; too liberal
; in friendship, too despotic in love, vain
i as a woman, firm as a man; frank with
! indiscretion, obliging without discrimina
tion, forgetful to heedlessness. vagabond
of body and soul, cosmopolitan by taste,
patriotic by feeling, rich in illusions and
caprices, poor In wisdom and experience;
j as lovable for his defects as for his ex
: cellencies; more seducing by his vice*
j than by his virtues; such is the Dumas
I one loves â or at least such he appears to
j me at this moment, for, obliged to ca'.l
! him up to paint him, I dare not affirm.
i in presence of the phantom before me,
: that I am not under some magic charm

Ingenious Point Raised.
Thomas Sullivan, a s=a!lor on the trans
port Sumner, lies at the Receiving Hos
pitnl in a critical condition as the result
cf a peculiar wound at the base of the
tkull. cauFed apparently by a heavy blow
from some blunt Instrument.
The man was found by Officer Dalton
yesterday morning on the eidewalk in
front cf John M. Russell's restaurant. 234
Eaft MrÂ«-<-t. Sullivan was In an uncon
tclous condition and seemed to have been
roughly handled. He was taken to the
Harbor Hospital and later removed to
the Receiving Hospital lor further treat
ment.
At the Receiving Hospital Sullivan told
a story of Waving the transport In the
iÂ«Â»arly morninK and walking up Kast street
%! ehort distance when two men sprang out
x of a dark alley and after knocking him
down went through his pocktte. Then
they, according to Sullivan, beat him se

Detective O'Dea was detailed on the

makes Sullivan's story seem very like a
"pipe dream."
Sullivan. Detective O'Dea learned, went
to Russell's restaurant about 6 a. m. He
ordered ham and eggs, and after eating
them told Russell to bring in his girls
and they"d have a time. Russell told him
to keep quiet. He then tendered a ten
dollar greenback In payment for his meal.
Hussell says that after Sullivan had got
his change he went to sleep in a chair In
the restaurant. After a time Russell
awakened him and told him to be moving.

O'Hara comes from an old military fam
ily, his great great grandfather having
played a conspicuous part in the surren
der of Cornwallis' army to Washington at
the end of the Colonial days, and his
father having gained distinction at the re
pulse of the night attack of the Filipinos
at Manila. ' '
The Board of Examiners consisted of
John R. Glascock, Dr. P. L. Wheeler and
Professor Frank Soule. They commenced
tneir labors on Thursday at noon and con.
eluded on Friday afternoon. At first there
were forty-seven applicants. The examin
ation was rigid, both from a mental and
physical standpoint and only twenty
eight remained to the end of the inqui
sition. Six were physically disqualified.
O'Hara gained an average of S7 per cent
and Adams 84 per cent.
O'Hara's father is Major O'Hara of the
First U. S. Artillery. He was among the
Ilrst to alarm the soldiers on the eventful
night of the Filipinos' attack. Young
O'Hara is also a descendant of General
O'Hara, who handed the surrendered
sword of Lord Cornwallis to Washington
at Yorktown. It is a historic fact that
Cornwallis pleaded sickness on the day
of the surrender and named O'Hara to
represent him.

The hopes of a large number of the
guardsmen in the service of the State of
California have been dashed by the posi
tive assertion of the, commander In chief
that there shall not' be any camps this
year. A number of the companies, In an
ticipation of camp life, purchased at their
own individual expense khaki uniforms,
making an outlay which they now regret.
The appropriation by Congress for the
National Guard of the several States
where such organizations exist will give
California an allowance of about $15,000.
That is, the War Department will issue
to the guard from the ordnance and ccmi
missary departments certain articles val
ued at the amount named.

NEW type of thievery was prac
Â¦II \\ ticed on the night of July 4 that
Jj apparently baffled the police
through its boldness and sim
plicity. A number of plate-glass windows
in the very heart of the, city were broken
In with cobblestones and goods were
stolen from the show windows that were
in some Instances trivial In value when
compared with the glass broken.
At Xolan's Shoe Store, 1022-24 Market
street, opposite Fifth, a curved plate
glass window which will cost $450
to replace was destroyed by some one in
tent on getting at some cheap watches in
side. The watches, given away with pur
chases of shoes, were hanging near the
window. The thief threw a rough cobble
stone through the glass, which is three
eighths of an inch thick, breaking a hole
large enough to enable him to reach the
watches. Fie had evidently worked in a
hurry, taking but ten out of about thirty
of the v/atches.
The burglary was not discovered until
7:30 o'clock the next morning, when the
store was opened. The cobble stone lay
in the window, as evidence to the manner
of the deed. At 9 o'clock W. H. Nolan,
the proprietor, arrived and at once tele
phoned to the police.
The burglary was probably done early In
the morning when out few people were on
tho street. The thief stood in the deep
recess of the doorway from which place
he hurled the cobblestone, safe from ob
servation. Evidently no policeman was
near enough to hear the crash of breaking
glass.
Eisner's fur store at 13S Geary street
was broken Jnto in the same manner and
doubtless earlier. A large window, set
obliquely to the street and making a deep
recess, was broken into a hundred pieces.
The thief took furs valued at $150, includ
ing a mink and a gray krimer cape. A Kea
otter overcoat, valued at $300 and within
easy reach of tho thief, was not molested.
A special watchman for that night at
the City of Paris dry goods store, across
the street, hoard the crashing noise made
by the failing glass, and ran out into the
street supposing some one had thrown
something through a City of Paris win
dow. He was slow in getting out through
the doors, and saw no one on the street.
He found Policeman Collins a block away
up G4ary street and together they found
the-brokeh window. It was then 1:30
o'clock. The proprietor of the store was
called up by telephone and a watchman
placed In charge. As in the case of thÂ»
shoe store burglary the police have not
yet found the stolen goods or other clew
to the identity of the thieves.
USED COBBLESTONE INSTEAD OF BURGLARS' JIMMY.
The price of oil has advanced. The
Southern Paciiic Company has contracted,
so the rumor is, for 15,000 barrels per
month in excess of what it has been pur
chasing for fuel. Large business lirms are
credited with contracting for 130,000 bar-
rels to be delivered In San Francisco in
six months. Then there is another story
out, to the effect that the Union Oil Com
pany has contracted for 150.000 barrels to
be landed in this city' before January 1.
There is a better price and a greater de
mand. The two facts belong together.
Second grade oil has just been sold on the
exchange in Los Angeles at $1 01 per bar
rel.
Xot every man or company with a "rig"
strikes oil in California. This is worth re
membering, icr the oil excitement is sure-
ly increasing and some will lose thÂ«lr
money. A well 1123 feet deep has just
been abandoned by a big brewing com-
pany. This was in the south, where it
does not much matter, for all localities
are likely to furnish some dry wells. In
the one alluded to there was no trace of
oil, but the firm has cheerfully begun to
sink another close by. Â»
There is a company in Ban Francisco
whose officers say to would-be purchasers
of stock, "it is all a gamble." On the
other hand there are companies that are,
seemingly, employing numbers of clair
voyants and fortune tellers to make peo
ple believe that fortunes attend upon the
following of the advice of these com
panies ween they counsel the purchase of
some designated stock, the names of the
companies, according to the clairvoyants,
being revealed to the latter in dreams.
Next in importance to California to the
discovery ot gold, says the Mining and
Scientific Press, is the present explolwi
tion of its oil wealth, supplying the one
lacking requisite of cheap ruel, and mak
ing possible an era of manufacturing.
And wh*'n is considered tho variety of
bye-products procurable from petroleum,
it is manifest that even fuel j supply may
become secondary in commercial import
ance to the value of the articles derived
from t!ie crude petroleum now being
pumped so abundantly throughout a large
urea of the State.
There is a pr^neral feeling In and about
the Visalia. land oflice, says the lianford
Journal, that ihe townships on the west
side, withdrawn* from settlement on ac
count of the controversy between oil land,
homestead an-1 "scrip", claimants, will
soon be again subject to entry. If that
should prove to be true the contestants
will law it out among themselves in con
tests in the Visalia land office, with pos
sible special Corr.missioners to take testi
mony.
A report has been in circulation during
the wftk that C'lianslor & Canfield have
disposed of their oil properties at Coalinga
to an English syndicate through Balfour,
Guthrie A: Co. The story Is denied by sev
eral parties, including the brokers alleged
to have taken part in the deal.
At last, after a period of poorly con
cealed hostility, open war has broken out
between the two oil exchanges in Los An
geles. The Los Angeles Oil Exchange has
taken the initiative and has adopted a res
olution declaring- "that no stock, security
or properly listed or dealt in on this ex
change shall be sold or offered for sale in
any other exchange or association for
dealing in like stocks, securities or prop
erty in this city by any member of this
exchange, either in person or through a
partner, clerk or otherwise, under a pen
alty of expulsion." At the meeting where
this was adopted it was also voted to in
crease the membership from fifty to one
hundred and to charge &0 for admission.
The BakersfieM Californian says: Canfleld,
Doheny and others have struck oil at a depth
of about 9v>0 feet near the half-section stake on
the south boundary of 115. fi, 2S. So far as can
be determined, the strike 13 a good one, pre
senting the same characteristics as elsewhere
in the territory. This well is on the outskirts.
It is more than a mile from the most northerly
hole on section 30 and is equally as far from
the Reed Crude's, rear the center of 20. By
the discovery of oil at this point close to a
thoufand acres are a'ldsd to the district's ex
tent assuming that tlie ground embraced be
tween is petroleum bearing, as has been the
case uniformly heretofore. No failure has yet
bean made in the Kern River fields to find oil
'between two discoveries.
One San Francisco real estate house ad
vertises 16,(X>0 acres of land for sale in the
Sunset district.
The Westlake Oil Company now has
twenty-six wells pumping and is getting
ready to pump two more.
Gas has been struck four miles north
west of Kullerton in a comparatively new
district, lying between Fullerton and the
Puente fields. The gas rushed out when
a drill was down 400 feet.
An interesting case has been heard be
fore the Superior Court in Los Angeles.
A woman residing in Mississippi, who
owns a lot In the northern part of Los
Angeles, was induced by a local oil oper
ator, two years ago, to lease the lot at
a nominal rental, under the representa
tion that he wished to build a tenement
on It. Later she learned that he really
wated to bore for oil, and in her com
plaint she alleges that he has extracted
20,000 barrels of oil from the property.
Several claims have been locatecf*ln this
city during the past week, south of
Golden Gate Park and well out toward
the ocean.
Daily Oil News, published at Los An
geles, says:
So much has been said of the necessity of
railrcad carriage for the Kern County product
that the prosress of railroad building Is very
closely watched. Work on the Kern River
â¢spur began In earnest on Monday of this week,
and Contractor Crowley of Lob Angeles now
has forty-eipht teams and large scrapers at
work. He estimated the time that It would
take to do the grading at sixty days, but on
account of the lightness of the material he
thinks now he will be throuch In half that
time. After completing the work on the six
mile spur up the river Mr. Crowley will put his
force on the Independent read to Sunset. This
Is about thirty mileg long, and Its construction
Is a matter of several months, although no de
lay is anticipated after work begins. The im
portance of the road to Sunset seems to bt
prowln* dally. Under their present definitions
the Sunset and the Kern River fields are of
very nearly equal area.
The Los Angeles Express finds that
some fortunes have been made from oil
In Southern California. On this subject
It says:
Among those who have been the largest
beneficiaries are W. B. Hardlson, who has
made about J150.000 within the past year,
Thomas Hughes has Increased his bank ac
count within the past eighteen months In
about the Fame flgrure, and Edward Strasburg
in to-day worth at least $100,000 more than he
was twelve months apo. Others who have
struck it rich In oil have been Councilman
Charles Toll. J3O.O00: i,. n. Mosher and Harry
Chandler, $40,000 each: Mesers. .Anderson and
Chtnslor, of Coallnga fame, about $500,000 each;

i|| make and keep SjÂ£"We all favor thÂ« extension of trade,
but do not let us be blind to the fact that
we who stay at home must foot the bills,
because the laboring man pays the taxes.
It may be, in the peculiar ways of provi
dence, that the war in China may so en
gage the British that reinforcements can
not be sent to South Africa and that the
brave Boers will conquer their heartless
enemies. Then President Bryan may
stretch his hand across the sea and con
gratulate brave old Paul Kruger. Wo alt
wish them godspeed in their unequal fight
for liberty." ,
The entrance of the Thirty-ninth Dis
trict Bryan Club, headed by a brass band
and carrying transparencies, created a
sensation at this stage in the proceedings.
Thomas W. Hickey made an energetic
and humorous speech. He said: "I am
glad to see that some of that Kansas City
convention enthusiasm has reached this
city. My Republican friends have done
so much boasting lately that I had about
commenced to think that there were no
Democrats left; but since I arrived here
to-night I have been reassured. Now Is
the only time that the Republicans can
shout, for after this campaign is over it
will be found thf.t the Republican party
has croaked."
Mr. Hickey told some clever and point
ed stories that met with the hearty ap
proval of the audience. He also spoke
briefly on the issues of the campaign,
particularly upon the Philippine question.
C. A. Swigert devoted ten minutes to
criticism of President McKinley and an
equal time to the praise of William J.
Bryan.
Judge Robert Ferral was Introduced as
the "man who could make more Demo
cratic votes by sitting back and smiling
afan audience than all the speakers com
bined by their oratorical efforts." He
beamed upon the audience as he advanced
to the front of the platform and said:
"I greet you and the assembled Democ
racy. The national platform and Bryan
and Stevenson as the nominees of the
Democratic party command the support of
all Democrats. They are winners. There
is room in our party for all; there is no
other place for Democrats. The 'results
of the coming elections are far-reaching
and affect national and State legislation
for years to come by reason of the re
quired redistricting of the States. All lo
cal and minor differences should be sub
ordinated in this great contest. I regret
my enforced absence, but join you in con
gratulating the party on the results of
the National Convention.
"JAMES H. BUDD."
They entered the hall cheering and set the
place in an uproar.*
Chairman Alford read the following tel
egram, from ex-Governor Budd, dated
Stockton:
granted by our constitution. "We as
Americans have the right to enforce
the Monroe doctrine only so long as
we will live by it ourselves.
"We are opposed to crossing 7000 miles
of water and acquiring a country inhab
ited rtve times as thickly as our own and
which we do not want as citizens and
force upon them a government that they
do not want and giving^, them no repre
sentation in it.
"The Kansas City platform declares
that we shall not accept them as citi
zens becauss we do not consider them
fit to become citizens, and not as sub
jects, because this is a country of
freedom and wants no subjects.
"The greatest day this nation hks
ever known will be the day on which
we go down into those islands and
without a suggestion on the 'part of
any nation on earth, take down the
flag that this party proposes to keep
unsullied as on the day that it first
appeared above the smoke and fire of
the revolution in Washington's hands
and say you are free."
J. J. Dwyer was greeted with cheers
when he was introduced. He Eald:
"I want to pledge my allegiance to the
platform that this arand party has put
forth, which is the Dest the party could
have posslbls' put forth. It has not struck
a new note. It Is the old, old note; the
note sent forth by the liberty bell, that
we are all created free and equal. Tho
spirit of liberty and the spirit of justice
shall be re-established in the foreign
policy and in the home policy of this gov
ernment.
"There seems to be nothing left for me
to say. I have enjoyed the flow of elo
quence and wit, in bd*th of which my
young friends are not lacking. They have
all expressed my sentiments. I think they
got wind of what 1 wanted to say, includ
ing the stories. /
"We are on the eve of the greatest cam
paign that has ever been fought since the
beginning of this grand country of ours.
It is a fight for principle, for personal lib
erty and for freedom from the mailed
hand of gold. We are glad to know that
that grandest American citizen and
statesman, pure in his private life and
In his public service, unswerving tn his
principles and honest in his every act in
public life, is to lead us to victory. Wil
liam J. Bryan stands head and shoulders
above the men of the day, and we may
be proud to follow him in this great bat
tle.
"It was left for the poor man who
had fought his way up among the
'giants of the land, who had fought
the battles of the Democracy without
flinching, to stand firmly upon tho
principle he has stood firmly upon
since he first set his face toward the
White House, and declare calmly to
the wavering leaders at the Kansas
City convention that his fight must
be made upon 'the free and unlimited
coinage of silver at the ratio of 16
to vr. . ' .
Judge Ferral talked for about twenty
minutes on the issues of the campaign.
The meeting 1 then adjourned.
This statement roused the audience to
the highest pitch of excitement. Men and
women sprang to their feet and cheered
until the building shook. After some hesi
tation, the leaders on the platform caught
the infection and joined in the demonstra
tion, which lasted fully live minutes.
Xaborers Will Be Paid.
Commissioner Meyero of the State Bu
reau of Labor was informed yesterday by
acting Auditor "William Wells that the de
mands of the carpenters, plasterers and
other laborers employed on the Hall of.
Justice buildlns will be paid when the city
has accepted the building and the original
contractors, Bateman Brothers, have been
settled with. When this is done the work
men will be the first to receive their
money, the sum of $13,000 having been set
aside specifically for that purpose. Mr.
Meyers will now go before the Board of
Supervisors and endeavor to induce that
body to accept the building In accordance
with the opinion of the City Attorney, that
the claims may be adjusted afterward-

bombs burst overhead, rock'i-ts screamed
through the air and a brass band rendered
jiatrioiic music. Crowds that gathered
to hear the music arid see the display
drifted gradually into the hall, which was
iiUed by fc:3u o'clock. Small flags were
distributed among the audience, until
every man, woman and child was sup
pMea. The hall itself was a mass of bunt
ins and flags, while a large painting of
"William Jennings Bryan, in a frame oi
bunting-, covered the drop at the back of
the stage.
William H. Alford, chairman of the
Democratic State Central Committee, ac
companied by Seth Mann and about
twoiuy vice presidents, appeared on tha
etage about S:15 and the party was greet
ed vv ith cneers. The brass band enlivened
the proceedings with a burst of patriotic
melodies and then the serious business or
the evening commenced.
Seth Mann Opened the Ball.
Seth Mann, introducing Mr. Alford as
chairman of the evening, said:
â¢â¢K< How citizens and lellow Democrats:
We have assembled here in mass meeting
to-night to ratify the nomination of our
next President, that matchless American
citizen and statesman. William Jennings
Bryan. (Tremendous cheerinp.i The plat

grandest that has ever been framed by

Bryan Stevenson, in this cris;s
of the nation, when every citizen Is on
trial as to his worth and honesty, in this
great contest have the faith of Jefferson,
that the people of the United States can

time because it is right on the foremost
questions of the dav. those of imperialism,
militarism and trusts. The success of the
Democratic party is the only hope of sav-
Inar the country from ruin."
Mr. Mann then introduced Mr. Alford.
who said:
â¢'Ladies and gentlemen: The principle
that the constitution follows the flag is
In the heart of every true American citi

Democracy in this great contest for ripht

A family named Hopgood, consisting of
father, mother and two daughters, has
been discovered near Richmond living in a
hollow ock tree. The rree was not large
enough to accommodate the whole family

turns, some sleeping under the tree and
others inside its decayed trunk. They
made their living by foraging and beg

Among the collection of the Dowagei
Empress is one egg that commemorates
a family storm and a royal problem.
Nicholas II. the present Czar, when a
boy had. as all the world knew, a most
irrational and vehement love affair. So
ciety was shocked, the heir apparent's
fond parents were distressed and alto
gether there was a very Interesting ex
hibition of the tempest that Cupid can.
upon occasion, stir up in a royal family.
Nicholas was hurriedly sent around the
world to complete his education and, as
usual, time and absence reduced the royal
heart to Us normal condition, .but the
Empress grieved greatly over the separ
ation from her son, and on Easter of
that year the Czar gave her an egg, in
side of which was a model of the ship
in which her . rebellious lad was sailing
away from heart entanglement. A gold
smith of famous skill had spent ten
months making the ship, which was of
solid gold, mounted on a beryl stone, and
was complete and accurate in every de- I
tail, down to the smallest cable.
THE duty of filing petitions to hold
a convention in San Francisco for
the purpose of nominating candi
dates for the Legislature and for
city and county judicial ofllces devolves
upon the local governing bodies of the po

of the Republican County Committee, an
nounced last night that a meeting of this
committee would be held at Shiels Hall
Tuesday evening, July 10, to frame and
adopt the petition, as required by the
primary election law. Unless such peti
tion be filed the political party represent
ed by the committee will not have a place
on the official ballot of the primary elec

To-morrow evening the Assembly Dis

It has for many generations been a
court custom for the reigning Czar to
give his wife at Kaster time an egg con
taining some Â¦â¢ handsome gift, usually a
souvenir of some particular event, and
the present Czar and his father, Alexan
der III, have always observed the old
custom. The two Empresses have, with
considerable misgivings, it is said, allowed
their Easter egg collections to go to Paris
and be placed on exhibition in the Rus
sian section of . the exposition, and the
French dramatic temperament is deeply
stirred and moved by this testimony- to
the: intimate and cordial relations be
tween the two nations. From the Eastei
eggs are being hatched fraternal senti
ments and touching enthusiasm .with reg
ular j. incubator, expedition and dispatch.
Many of the eggs are exceedingly inter
esting as objects of art. â¢
The lirst received by the present Czar
ina was given to her in the year of hei
coronation. It is a large golden egg,
enameled in rose color, and contains a
tiny and perfect model of the state car
riage in which the young bride rode to
the Moscow cathedral on her wedding
day. , The coach is of gold, cushioned In
red enamel and hung with tiny, silver
curtains which can be drawn on gold
wires. The : imperial crown in beautiful
diamonds ornaments the panels. Â¦
The last Easter, egg added to the Czar
ina's collection â¢ was presented this year

.Easter is celebrated in Russia with
great ceremony, and the custom of giv

did not attempt to cast more than one
ballot apiece, nor did they defire to ques

The polls opened at 9 a. m.. and when
they closed at 5 171 ballots had been cast.
The regular ticket, which was headed bj
E. W. McKinstry. was elected unanimous

a grand banquet was held in the basement
of the hall three hours later. The men
who had voted during the day appeared
on the scene burdened with appetites.
They ate and partook of liquid refresh
ments, listened to felicitous speeches and
toasted the outgoing and the new presi
dent. Ex-PresHent Nlles Searls introduced
his successor in an appropriate speech and
then departed for home. President Mc-
Kinstry expressed his appreciation of the
honor bestowed on him, and called upon
Judge A. R. Cotton, J. H. Jewett, Thomas

speeches, and they 1 responded.

The Legislature of 1S99 passed an act
providing fo^the construction of a wagon
road from the Mono Lake basin to con
nect with the Tioga road, and appropri
ated $25,000 for the purposes of construc
tion. The road when completed, declares
the act, shall be a State highway, and be
placed under the control of the State De
partment of Highways. The Highway
Commissioner, through Congressman Ma
rion de Vries, applied to the Secretary of
the Interior for permission to construct
the road through the forest reservation.
This permission the Secretary refused
to grant.^or the reason that to place such
a road as contemplated under the con
trol -of the California Department of
Highways would result in such a divi
sion of * authority and responsibility as
would militate against the proper admin
istration of the affaira of the reservation.
Mr. Maude then sought the advice of the
Attorney General with relation to the au
thority of the Highway Commissioner to
condemn the land necessary for such a
road with the result stated. The Attor
ney General states that it is very doubt
ful' whether a State can condemn for pub
lic use the land reserved by the United.
States Government from settlement, oc
cupancy and sale. But, even though the
power existed, statutes providing for the
taking o? property, by exercising the
power of eminent domain must be strictly
construed, and neither the act authoriz
inc the construction of the road nor the
act defining the general powers of the
Highway Department give the 'right, in
Ft)., ilic terms, to condemn a right or way
through Federal lands so reserved. Aside
from these considerations, there is still
the objection that the State law providing
for the taking of property by eminent do
main states that the proceedings must be
brought in the Superior Court of the
countv in which the property is situate,
and it is well settled that suits against
the United States cannot be maintained
in a State court.
Attorney Ooneral Tirey L. Ford, upon a
report made to him by Deputy William
M. Abbott, has rendered an opinion to the
effect that State Highway Commissioner
J. L- Maude has no authority to condemn
a right of way for the so-called Tioga
,road through the lands In the Yosmite
National Park, withheld from settlement
by the TJnited States Government as a
forest reservation.

The effort of Mrs. Maggie Donovan of

Some months ago Mr. Pluijkett, who is a

employment, and in order to maintain
herself and baby and assist her husband
Mrs. Plunkett decided to find employ
ment. This she did and placed her baby
In Mrs. Donovan's charge, agreeing to
pay $20 a month for the child's support.
A short time ago Plunkett secured work
again and decided to once more, gather
his little family around him. Mrs. Dono
van, however, refused to surrender the
possession of the child until her bill for
$100 for five months' services was liqui
dated. Mr. Plunkett did not have the
money to meet her -demand and, as his

without avail, he decided to sue out a writ

INTEREST WAS FOUR
TIMES THE PRINCIPAL
The generous response by the public to
the appeal for contributions to the Swee
ney fund is fittingly recognized by Fire
Chief Sullivan in the following communi
cation addressed by him yesterday to the
editor of The Call:
HEADQUARTERS OF THE SAN FRAN
CISCO FIRE DEPARTMENT. CITY.
July 7, 190a
To the Editor San Francisco Callâ Dear Sir:
It is with the most profound feelings of grati
tude that I beg to give to the generous public
of this city a report of the result of the benefit
performance given by the Associated Theatrical
Managprs of San Francisco in aid of the widow
and orphans of our late gallant comrade. John
Edward Sweeney, and the amount of money so
freely donated to the fund. I beg to Inclose to
you a copy of a letter which I have to-day re
ceived from the secretary of the Associated
Theatrical Managers, which shows that the
grand total of the sale of tickets for the per
formance reached the sum of seven thousand
nine hundred and flfty-elght dollars ($7955).
The amount of cash contributions which havÂ«
been sent to me up to this afternoon amounts
to the munificent sum of six thousand live hun
dred and ninety-three dollars and sixty cents
(?6593 60), giving a gTand total of fourteen
thousand five hundred and fifty-one dollars and
sixty cents <$ll.551 CO). I feel that It is a matter
of duty to let the public know what will be the
disposition of this magnificent fund, to which
is yet to he added the contributions which your
valuable paper and other newspapers have in
charge.
Acting <â¢:Â» the wish of Mr*. Sweeney that I
should take charge of this fund. I have con
sulted with many of the prominent business
men of the city, for I wish' to take no step
without feeling assured that It will meet the
hearty approval of all who have made the fund
popslble. The general opinion of the gentlemen
I have consulted is that the money should be
Invested in gilt-edged bonds for the benefit of
the orphans of the gallant Sweeney, the inter
est on the same, which will be 4 per cent or
more, to be paid to Mrs. Sweeney monthly.
This interest. . with the pension paid by the
Fire Department, will assure Mrs. Sweeney
about $90 per month. It Is proposed to Invest
the fund with the Union Trust Company of
this city, thus securing the principal until the
youngest child of Mrs. Sweeney comes of' age.
It is further proposed that there be three trus
teeÂ»,Â«f this fund, and I. W. Hellman, Esq.. has
kindly consented to serve, while I am in hopes
that W. Crocker. Esq.. will also consent to act
as one of the trustees, the third trustee to be
myself on behalf of the Fire Department.
I cannot close thl* letter without once again
rendering sincere thanks on behalf of Mrs.
Sweeney and her fatherless ones, and also on
behalf of the men of my department . and for
myself to the public and all who made so great
a success of this grand testimonial to the dead
hero.
To the Associated Theatrical Managers of the
city, to the members of the theatrical profes
sion, to the musicians and stage hands, to the
theatrical attaches, to the newspapers, print-
Ing houses and the .thousands who donated so
freely to the fund we are deeply indebted, and
to all we say:
"Your bounty is beyond my speaking:
But, though my mouth be dumb, my heart
shall thank you."
Very respectfully yours,
D. T. SULLIVAN.
4. Chief S. F. F. D.
The letter received by the chief from
the theatrical managers is as follows:

Grand Chapter, one of whom, Judge Mil
ton Hills Myrick. ex-Justice of the Su

younger members'in the celebration. He
concluded in these words:
"Would that the disputes and the differ
ences of men ar.d nations might always
be settled by arbitration, and never by
force; and i"n the half-century next to
come let us seriously hope that the prin
ciples of Freemasonry may so far prevail
among men and nations everywhere that
truth and morality, enlightened reason
and justice may ever guide and protect
mankind from Ignorance and malice and
greed."
The closing portion of the celebration
was the banquet and dance at the Palace
Hotel. About 350 persons, about one-half
ladies, occupied the tables spread in the
dining hall, which for the occasion was
decorated with rare good taste, the princi
pal decoration, however, being in electric
lights, an announcement that the occasion

MESSAGES FLY
OVER THE WATER
ON AIR WAVES
Fort Mason Communicates
With Alcatraz by Wire
less Telegraphy.
Practical Demonstration of the Util
ity of Marconi's Invention is
Made by Military
Men.
The masts utilized in the sending of
wireless messages are tho ordinary flag
poles. Batteries induce electrical agita
tion at the tops of the poles and messages
of anv length are easily and perfectly re
ceived through the agency of ordinary
telegraphic Instruments.
The distance between Fort Mason and
Alcatraz Island is hardly more than one
and a half miles, but messages have been
gent many miles by wireless telegraphy.
The local atmospheric conditions have
proved to be as favorable to the transmis
sion of these messages here as elsewhere.
The wireless telegraphy is used success
fully among the fortifications around thÂ»;
harbor of New York. The strategic value
of the invention, from a military point
of view, is that communication cannot be
cut off by an enemy.
Military officers stationed here say that
while the messages are diffused in all di
rections and so can be easily caught at
any point where the proper apparatus Is
located, the use of a secret military code
would prevent an enemy from learning
anything through such leakage. During
the experiments between Fort Mason and
Alcatraz Island the old Morse code, fa
miliar to all handlers of the key, has been
used.
"Wireless telegraphy has achieved an
other signal victory. Fort Mason and
Alcatraz Island have "been using the sys
tem successfully for a fortnight. At
each place a mast about seventy-rtve feet
high has been equipped on. the lines laid
down by Marconi, and there has been no
difficulty in carrying on conversations be
tween the two military posts. The sound
ers have acted perfectly. Messages have
flown to and tro, in space, borne by the
mysterious etheric waves.
The fact has been satisfactorily demon
strated that all the military posts around
the bay of San Francisco can communi
cate with each other by wireless teleg
raphy, and any vessel in the bay, prOp
erly equipped, can receive and send mes
sages.
The experiments have recently been un
der the direction of Captain Dyer. In
charge of the Signal Service during the
absence of Major Moore. The public has
not been invited to visit either Fort Ma
son or Alcatraz Island, nor will it be, as
the presence of a crowd would Interfere
with the work of the Signal Service Corps
and there Is really nothing to see, any
way.

SCHOONER BENDER BEOS. COLLIDES WITH THE MAHION.
Tha Naval Reserve training ship Ma
rlon neems to be the object of attack of
every sailing craft In the bay. If a
schooner captain cannot ftnd anything
else to run Into he Is sure to foul the
handsome old warship before he reaches
Mission Bay. Yesterday the schooner
Bender Bros, ranged up alongside tho
training ship with all sails set. The Ben
der Bros, was making for an anchorage
off Mission Creek, when the wind sudden
ly fell light. Do what he would, the cap
tain could' not clear the Marion, bo the
schooner struck her squarely on the star
board bow. An attempt 'was made to
warp her off, but It failed, so when the
tug Milton came along the offer of a tow
was gladly accepted. The Bender Bros,
was towed away minus some of her sails,
while the Marlon only suffered the loss of
considerable paint on her starboard quar
ter.
Ready to Carry Troops.
Lncle Sam has been making inquiries as
to how many men he can send to China
from San Francisco without any undue
rush, and the result shows that the Sum
ner can leave here on July 16 with 57 offi
cers and 680 men, the Meade on August 1
with GO otllcers and 1171 men, the Hancock
on Aupust 16 with 54 officers and 1062 men,
the "Warren September 1 with 42 officers
and 1242 men, the Thomas on September
16 with C9 officers and 1654 men and the
Grant on October 1 with 68 officers and
1836 men. From this It can be seen that
without straining the present transport
facilities the United States can easily land
7645 men and 350 officers at Hongkong in
side of ten weeks. People around the
transport wharf seem to think there will
be another call for volunteers, and that
the First Californlan will be in service
again inside of six weeks.
A Flier From New York.
The steamer Dolphin, destined for the
trade between Seattle and Skaguay, ar
rived from New York last night. She was
formerly an excursion steamer running
between Boston and Portland, Me., and
Is very fast. She Is a similar vessel to
the Cottage City of the Pacific Coast
Steamship Company's line and has excel
lent passenger accommodations.
The Dolphin has made a very quick run.
Her arrival at Montevideo on June 1 was
only posted at the Exchange yesterday
afternoon and a few hours later the
steamer was posted on another part of
the board as "three miles out."
From Point Lucia In the West Indies
the Dolphin made the run to Montevideo
In twenty-one days. ' The run through the
Straits of Magellan was quick and un
eventful and on June 14 the Dolphin was
coaling at Coronel. From there the run
up the coast was without Incident and
the captain and crew are congratulating
themselves on the quick passage.
Water Front Notes.
The KoFmoa liner, Serapis.- sailed for
Hamburg yesterday via Central and South
American ports. She was loaded to the
guards with general merchandise and had
a lot of redwood lumber on deck. A few
passengers went away on the vessel. Two
of the crew of the British ship Blackbraes
were among those who were homeward
bound.
Captain Underwood, late of the barken
tlne Newsboy, went out as master of the
schooner Robert lowers. Captain Good
man of the Lew-era went out as a pas
senger and on his arrival at Honolulu will
take command of another of the com
pany's vessels.' Captain Chipperfleld is
now In command of the barkentlne News
boy.
The steamer Czarina will not return to
Honolulu for another month. She has
been chartered to load here, for Seattl*
and Tacoma and will then bring a load
of coal back from Oyster Harbor.
The new schooner Commerce, with a
capacity of fiOO.OOO feet of lumber, will be
launched from Hay & Wright's yards
next month. A duplicate of the Com
merce has been laid down and a new
steamer for the Inter-Island Steamship
Company of Hawaii will be begun this
week. The new steamer Is to be 172 feet
long, 36 feet beam and 14 feet deep. She
will be much larger than the ! Kalulani,
which was built by Hay & Wright several
years ago, and will exceed In speed any
thing In the lnter-lsland trade.

TEN DOLLARS PER DAY
DEMANDED FOR WAGES
George Ridley Acted as Steamboat
Fireman in an Emergency and
Brings Suit.
George Ridley filed suit in the United
States District . Court yesterday against
the Kotzebue Sound Transportation Min
ing and Trading Company and L. E. Xoo
nan to recover $240 wages alleged to be
due for his' services as fireman on the
steamer Kotzebue for twenty-four days a*
$10 per day in July and August, 189S
The story, as told In the complaint, la
that RiOley was a passenger on the steam
er going up the Kobuk River in Alaska
and that, owing to the gold hunting excite
ment prevailing at that time,, the steam
er was without a fireman and was unable
to secure the services of one. In this
emergency Ridley volunteered and shovel
ed coal into the furnace .for twenty-feur
days. Under the circumstances he "believes
that his labor was reasonably* worth Â¦ $10
per day.

the Charge of Robbery â¢
Sworn To. '
Lewis West, the "sport" who, it is
claimed, bunkoed Romulo R. Ruiz of San
ta Barbara out of $500 In Golden Gate
Park a week ago by means of a fake
foot race, has not yet been found by the
police. Besides being charged with an as
sault with a deadly weapon for hittinff
Ruiz over the head with a revolver an
other charge of robbery has been pre
ferred against him.
The complaining witness in the robbery
case is E. L. McPhall and the warrant
was sworn to before Judge Conlan ves
tcrday. McPhail was the stakeholder, "and
before the redoubtable Hennessy and the
"unknown" finished the supposed race Mc-
Phail alleges that West presented a re
volver at his head and demanded the $500
stake on pain of instant death. To save
his life McPhail handed over the coin
and when Ruiz protested West hit him
over the head with the revolver.

msn to disciose his identity excepting a
card issued by the California Fruit Can

will probably lead to h:s identification.
The burglar wns evidently familiar with

habit not to --trike a light, and this fact
troved the burglar's undoing. Hubert ha-1
hardly gene to his room in the rear cf the
place when he h<ard something rattling
the lock on the WaFhington street side of
tho store. He stopped and listened a mo
ment, and was :tbout to dismiss the mat
ter'from his mind, because he thought it
was the policeman on his nightly round.
As the noise continued he paused to listen,
end was astounded a minute later to hear
the heavy lock l< ing wrenched from its
fastenings. Within the next minute he

that the burglar would soon be upon him
Hubert rushed to his room and secured

his pockets was found a card of the Cali
fornia Fruit Canners' Association, No
f.37, and upon which had been written in
pencil the name, and address of the
holder. The lead penciling had been so
badly blurred that even under a magnify
ing glass it did not disclose the Identity of
the dead man.
"I did not have any light," he said. "It
has always been my practice to retire
without one. When the noise con

if the coast was clear. He returned a few
later and when I heard him snap

gun. When the burglar had succeeded in
breaking the Fecond lock he repeated his
run round the corner, returning very
quickly to complete his work. He then

cool and collected as the officers on watch

He regretted having taken a life, but said
he acted In self-defense. Hubert said he
was 28 years of age and that he had
worked for Sir. Tietjen for the past three
years. He said that his employer had
closed up the establishment at 10 o'clock

BURGLAR KILLED
BY A WATCHMAN
on the scene could not decipher the card.
They thought that the man's name was
B. Fisher and that he lived at 10 Rlncon
Place. The dead burglar had two dollars
in small change on him and a lot of cigar
ettes. He has every semblance of being a
workingman. His clothes were of cheap
quality and his hands showed every indi
cation of toil. He Is clean shaven, had
dark hair and looked to be about twenty
five years of age. The detectives say his
face Is familiar and they also think he is
an old timer at. picking locks.
The instrument which he used to force
his way to his death was a jimmy an inch
wide and about fifteen inches in length.
It Is now at police headquarters.
found at 9 o'clock, and it seems very
strange that he should have been kept at
the hotel till after 5 o'clock and then sent
to us to die on the way.
The body was In a frightful condition.
The entire breast and abdomen wns de
nuded of epidermis, and patches of skin
had ploughed off of the hands, legs and
feet. Blisters were In evidence that could
not have been produced either by mor
phine poisoning or by beating with towels.
"I do not know who the physician was
or what the nature of the treatment was.
but the man was scalded. Doubtless I
shall be called to testify at the inquest,
and I shall swear to the facts as I have
stated them to you."
Dr. Noble Says He Acted Right.
Dr. Noble laughs at the idea that his
treatment was anything but proper, and
asserts that it alone kept Stadie alive
for some eight hours. He claims that the
sloughing off of the epidermis was due
mainly io the morphine poisoning, and
that in any case it is superficial and would
not have serious effects.
"The immediate cause of death," Dr.
Xoble said last evening, "was oedema of
tho lungs, a paralysis and filling np ot
the respiratory organs. I saw at 5 o'clock
that the man could not live, but I was
not responsible for his removal to the
Harbor Receiving Hospital.
"When I was called to examine Stadie
shortly after 9 o'clock I found that he
was still alive. He had evidently taken
morphine and I administered antidotes
accordingly. Then I asked for two male
nurses. None were to be had and we
pressed a couple of painters Into service.
I told them to give the patient a hot bath.
They put him In the tub and dipped the
water up with their hands to pour over
him, so it could not have been so terribly
hot. > _ __ ,
Not Caused by Hot Water.
"When they took him out I noticed his
skin was pretty red, but I am sure the
bath din not cause the separation of the
epidermic. I had the painters beat him
Â¦with towels, the usual treatment. This
flagellation no doubt aided- the separation
of the epidermis, which was started by
the poisoning. Had death been brought
about by the loss of the epidermis the
symptoms would have shown the cessa
tion of the excretive functions of the
skin, instead of oedema of the lungs."
Dr Leland performed the autopsy on
the body after it had been removed to the
Morgue" He found that death was due to
shock and possibly to morphine poisoning.
This latter must yet be determined by a
chemical analysis of the stomach. There
was no oedema of the limes as Xoble
stated and Leland says that death would
have ensued from the frightful burns
even though the man succumbed to the
effects of the poison he is said to hava
taken.
Had Trouble With His Wife.
Stadie married a sister of a street medi
cine vender named Davis, who claims to
be a graduate of a prominent Chicago
medical college. Stadie had assisted Davis
for some time past. He lived with hl3
wife and daughter, the latter 5 years of
ace, in St. Marys alley until a few days
ago. Recently Stadie had been despond
ent and talked to some of hla associates
about trouble his wife. who. he de
clared, was no'longer true to him.
Stadie emptied his purse In payment of
the price of the room at the Palace. He
registered as "Ernest" Stadie. Tearing
hotel envelopes open, he wrote three
notes. One to the Coroner was as follows,
the signature being so scrawled that It
looked much like "Kladie":
To the Orcner: 1 leave my body to the
medical fraternity and would like to have my
brain examined, whether I was normal or not.
STAPIE.
A second was addressed to Henry Hor
wege, who runs a grocery at the corner of
Pine and Dupont streets. It was aa fol
lows:
Pear Henry: Tou have been a good friend
of mine, but I can't help my luck. Life Is not
worth livlnff. Tours. PAUL.
The third note, to his wife, was evi
dently written last. It la as follows:
Dear Annie: I have drank the poison and
don't know how Ion* I will have to live. Dar
ling, take care of the child. If you have any.
regard at all for me. raise her to be a decent
woman. I love you and would never have
harmed a hair of your hpad. But It Is too late
now. Henry Is a s"od friend of mine, go
and see him for my sake. My head gets dlrzy.
Yours. PAUL.
A seafaring man named Roberts, who
said his wife was Stadie's sister, called to
see the would-be suicide at the Palace
Hotel during the afternoon. He told the
attendants that Stadie belonged to an ex
cellent family and was at one time an of
ficer in the German army. He was 37
years old. At Horwege's grocery little is
known of Stadia's affairs.

der arrest have been disposed of. â¢
Some people insist that Mitchell did the
killing, but this theory Is only advanced
by friends of the imprisoned men. The
evidence is becoming almost positive
against the trio under arrest and the offi
cials expect within a few days to have
the ea<?e In such a shape that a conviction
cannot be averted.
Baehmann told Sheriff Mansfield that
when he sold the weapons he knew of
the bitter enmity existing between his
countrymen and the negro's family. He
suspected that the guns were being pur
chased for no good purpose, but he sold
them, knowing that if they could not be
procured at his place the men could get
them somewhere else. In addition to the
two rifles, which were cf the same caliber
as the bullets which killed Mrs. Mitchell
and her son, a shotgun and shells were
sold to the men. Thus far there is no
evidence that a shotgun was used In the
double murder.
GUNS PURCHASED BY TWO OF THE MUHDER SUSPECTS.
SHERIFF MANSFIELD AND BACHMAN EXAMINING PHO
TOGRAPH OF EHLERS.
I find that Paul Stadie was
lit'erally boiled to death in a
treatment to which he had been
submitted for morphine poison
ing. What part the poison play
ed in causing his death is yet to
be determined by a chemical
analysis of the stomach. It was one
"of the most horrible cases I have
ever seen. The epidermis of
over three-fourths of the body
had been peeled off. The state
ment of Dr. Noble that the man
died of oedema of the lungs is
erroneous. The autopsy failed
to show any such condition.
THOS. B. W. LELAND.
â¢jr=^AUL STADIE, an eccentric Ger-
Ljj^/man. took morphine with suicidal
|Â£ Intent at the Palace Hotel yester
day. Shortly after his condition
was discovered a physician was called
and at his dictation the unfortunate man
was submitted to a treatmtnt by two
painters in which he was literally boiled
to death. His sufferings ended several
hours later, and his horribly scalded body
is mute evidence of the fearful manner of
his death.
Body In Frightful Condition.
An autopsy performed last night by Dr.
Thomas B. W. Leland showed that death
was due principally to burns. The body
presented a sickening spectacle as it lay
on the Morgue slab. More than three
fourths of the epidermis had peeled oft,
exposing the nerves and blood vessels. In
some places the blood oozed out and the
condition was such that a rigid investi
gation of the horrible case will 'be made
by the Coroner.
Stadie resided at 14 St. Marys alley.
Friday night he deserted his mean quar
ters and his family troubles and sought
shelter beneath the roof of the great
hostelry wherein to end his wretched ex
istence. When a bell boy went to call him
at 9 o'clock yesterday morning he found
that he had taken poison and Dr. J. Albeit
Noble was called. The physician recom
mended a hot bath and asked for nurses.
None could be secured so a couple of
painters were selected to do the job.
They placed the unfortunate man in boil
ing water and cooked his flesh.
About 5 o'clock In the evening the doc
tor savs he realized that the man cou;d
not live and he was started for the Har
bor Hospital. Before he reached there
he was dead. When the hospital phy
sicians viewed the remains and saw their
condition they were highly indignant and
Dr. F, A. Robinson, who was in charge,
made this statement:
"The man breathed his last as he was
belnp removed from the ambulance. I ap
plied various tests to be sure that death
had ensued and could not get the slight
est reflex.' I understand that the man was
MOPE has risen from the ashes of
despair for that army of Nevada
brides and grooms who, fresh from
California divorce courts, hurried
to the Sagebrush State and again launch
ed upon the sea of matrimony. In direct
contradiction to the opinion recently ren
dered by Judge Belcher, a decision was
handed down by Judse J. C. B. Hebbard
yesterday In which he holds that marriage
of divorcees who secured their freedom In
this State, or in any other State or na
tion, even within the prohibitory period Â¦
of one year, as fixed by the California
law, are legal and valid. This decision,
though not final, will carry peace into
many cities and hamlets throughout the
land. In hundreds of homes in which
Judge Belcher's decision caused' anxiety
and doubt tÂ« dwell' cvriter. I in a niL-asiiro
has come, but anxiety will continue to
prevail .until the Supreme Court of the
State has passed final Judgment on the
issues involved.
Judge Hebbard's decision, Â¦ which has
aroused even greater interest than that of
his associate on the bench, is in the dt
vorce case of Fredericka V. Adler vs. Ben
Adler and 13 as follows:
Plaintiff seeks a divorce upon the ground
of extreme cruelty. Defendant, by way of
cross-complaint, seeks annullment of the
marriage upon the ground that It was con
tracted within a year from the date of
plaintiff's divorce from her former hus
band. Plaintiff was divorced from her hus
band, Dunbar. in California, May 2, 1S39;
she married the defendant at Reno, State
of Nevada, June 26, 1899; this action was
commenced June 13, 1900.
Is a Nevada Marriage Legal P
The Blngle question before the court Is
whether or not the Xevada marriage Is
valid in California, It Is claimed that un
der the provisions of section 61 of the Civil
Code, the marriage though valid In the
Stat* of .Nevada, where contracted, must be
annulled at the instance of either party
thereto in this State. The portion of sec
tion-61 relied upon is as follows:
"A subsequent marriage contracted by
any person during the life' of a former hus
band or wife of such person, with any per
son other than such former husband or
wife, is illegal and void from the beginning,
unless:
"X The former marriage has been annulled
or dissolved, provided, that In case It be dis
solved, the decree of divorce must have
been rendered and made at least one year
prior to such subsequent marriage."
Xo reason Is apparent from the language
of the section why an arbitrary prohibitory
period of a year, or of any certain fixed
period should be made, and there can be no
good reason given. , We may Imagine the
reason which induced the passage of the
section by an examination of the law of
the State of Oregon upon the same subject.
In that State there is no fixed prohibitory
period, but the law is to the effect that,
pending an appeal from a decree of divorce,
if one be taken, and. If not, during the
time In which It may be taken, the parties
shall be incapable of contracting marriage
with a third person.
In California an appeal from a flnaj Judg
ment must be taken In six months; an ap
peal from an order granting or refusing a
new trial in sixty days.
Why Make Them WaitP
The great majority of dU'orce cases go to
Judgment upon the default of the defend
ants, and In such cases there can be no ap
peal upon the merits of the cause. When
for appeal has gone by and none has been
taken, why compel the parties In the case
to abstain from matrimony for the remain
der of the year thereafter?
The proportion of divorce decrees appeal
ed from is infinitely small, and therefore
the prohibition in section 61 discriminates
against the many for the protection ot the
few; it is an arbitrary law.
The laws of all civilized nations favor
marriage;- this law is In restraint thereof.
Marriage In this State is declared to be a
civil contract: it ought, therefore, to be
governed by the rules which govern other
contracts, save that It cannot be broken at
the mere â¢ will of the parties thereto, and
ought not be entered Into again by the
parties with third parties after divorce un
til, the possibility of. a reversal of the de
crfe ceases to exist.
For the purpose of a decision In this case,
however. It is not necessary for the court
to pars definitely upon the validity or in
validity of section 61. Civil Code. This sec
tion has not yet been construed by our Su
preme Court, but there is another section of
the same code, section 63, which has been a
law since the adoption of the codes in 1S72.
which our. Supreme Court has construed:
"Sec. C3. All marriages contracted with
out this State, which would be valid by the
laws of the country In which the same were
contracted, . are valid In this State."
Supreme Court Decision.
This section was considered by the Su
preme C/irt in 1S73 In the case of Pearson
vs. I'earlon, 51 Cal.. p. 120. One Pearson
lived in Missouri and owned a slave woman
named Lnura. After Pearson's divorce from
his lawful wife he desired to marry Laura,
but such intermarriages were prohibited by
the laws of the State of Missouri; Pearson
removed to the Territory of- Utah, where
there was no local law against such mar
rlagres.. and- there married Laura. The .ac
tion was ejectment, the plaintiff being the
legitimate daughter of Pearson by his first
wife, the defendant being Laura, Pearson's
Utah wife.
The Supreme Court declared Laura to be
the surviving wife of Pearson and awarded
the property to her. The court said :
â¢"The marriage, of these parties (Pearson
and Laura) being valid, by. Jhe law of the
place where it was contracted. Is "also valid
in this State. The statute - In . this State
provides In terms that all marriages con
tracted Without theÂ» State -which would be
valid by the law*.* the country In which
the same were contracted shall be .valid in
all courts and places within this State. The
statute accords with- the general principle
of law theretofore prevailing. The validity
of the marriage ~ (except it be polygamous
or incestuous) is. to be tested by the law of
the place where It is celebrated. If : valid
there it is valid everywhere-. It has a legal
5HERIFF JOSEPH MANSFIELD of
San Mateo County is still energetic
in gathering evidence against the
men charged rvith the murder of
Mrs. William Mitchell and her son David,
which occurred at Colma on July 4. One
of the most important facts seems now to
have been settled. The purchase by the
suspects of the guns which it is believed
were used in the double tragedy has been
proven beyond a doubt. Lemoscher ad
mits the purchase and Baehmann, the
Clay-street gunmakor. who sold the
weapons, yesterday made a partial identi-
Jcation of Eh!ers from a photograph re
cently published Jn The Call, which was
shown him by Sheriff Mansfield. Be
yond this admission the prisoners will not
discuss their case. They have secured an
attorney and will prepare to battle for
their lives.
After it had been made public that the
place where the weapons had been pur
chased had "been located by the police.
Lemoscher admitted having been a party
to the purchase. He was well known to
Baehmann. and probably considered that
any effort to further conceal his Identity
in the transaction would hf useless. He
accordingly told the Sheriff that he went '
to the More on July 3 in company with ;
another man and bought two ririÂ«*s and a I

the two have been boon companions, driv

LONDON, July 7.â American athletes
to-day won eight out of thirteen of
the amateur events for the cham
pionship of Great Britain. The
Amateur AthleticAssociation cham
pionship games were held at Stamford
Bridge, and as the Americans competed
in only twelve of the events they won all
but four of thÂ» contests in which they
took part.
Such a clean sweep is without parallel.
More especially is it noticeable when it
is remembered that they opposed the best
amateurs, not only from England. Ire
land and Scotland, but the Colonies as
well.
The New Tork Athletic Club got the
Iron's share, taking the weight-putting,
hammer-throwing, pole-vaulting and
four-mile run. Pennsylvania was second,
winning the high jump, the hurdles and
the long jnmp. Georgetown University
won the 100-yard dash. Princeton Lni
versity secured second place In the 100
yard dash and the high jump, while Chi
cago University secured the same place
in the quarter-mile run and Pennsylvania
added to her laurels by getting second
place In the pole vault. Syracuse Uni
versity failed to put in an appearance,
both her men not arriving in time to en
able them to participate in the events. If
a few American competitors had not been
either prevented entirely from running
or been so palpably out of form, owing
lo the climate, probably every event
would have been won by them: but with
Â«'regan of Princeton University in ill
health, scarcely knowing whether he was
going to run until the bell rang, and
with Terry of Princeton entirely' knocked
out with "a water knee, and Orton and
Alexander Grant unable to come within
twentv seconds of the normal time, it was
impossible for the Americans to make a
clean .sweep.
Kraenzlein established a world s record
lor hurdles over grass and received more
applause than the other competitors, re
gardless of nationality. As Lord Alver
slone said, when they were distributing
the prizes:
"Kraenzlein. we. have not got enough
medals to give you. We only hope you
Americans will come over next year and
defend your cup. Then we hope to have
better runners to put up against you.'
Several American competitors believed
they were treated with none too much
fairness. This they attributed not bo
much to their English competitors as to
the character^ of the officials in charge of
the American Amateur Athletic Associa
tion, who were no means representative
men. Two distinct fouls were made
against the Americans, which the Judges
disallowed.
Victorious From the Start.
The Americans started off wnll. Walter
B. Tewksbery of Pennsylvania Univer
sity, Arthur Duffy of Georgetown Univer
sity ami Charles Lindsay Burrows of
Chicago University won their respective
heats in the 100-yard dash. Tewksbery
easily defeated Prltchard, the champion
of India, and Woolsley, the English
champion, in 10 1-5 seconds. . Duffy beat
Jupp, the champion of 1898. T.. B.' Mc-
Clain of the University of Pennsylvania
was second. The crowd greeted the heat
winners with good-natured . applause,
while awaiting anxiously for the final,
after seeing how easily the home cracks
Burrows had a walk-over in his heat.
A. C. Kraenzlein of the University of
Pennsylvania. Edmond J. Monahan of
Georgetown University, Prinztein of Syr
acuse University and McLean of the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania, did not compete,
as Burrows had a sure thing. " .
The last trial heat for the 100 yards was
easily won by F. Jarvis of Princeton in
10 1-5 seconds, beating Henry Berry Stack
and Maloney, both of Chicago University,
who were also beaten by the Englishman?
Massey. Thus all the heats of the 100
-yard race were won by Americans with
the exception of one, which Standley
Rowley, the New South Wales champion,
ciptured.
Before the final of the 100-yard contest
was run the mile race was started. It
proved a poor contest until the last lap,
when the men were well bunched. Then
C. Bennett, one of the best meil in Eng
land, went to the front and w^n as he
liked In poor time. Alexander Grant, Uni
versity of Pennsylvania, was never dan
gerous, while Edward R. Bushness, Uni
versity of Pennsylvania, was left far be
hind. Bennett got a salvo of cheers from
the home crowd. Â£E&9iBMftrtHH3SÂ£SBSMiBISia
Americans Run .One-Two-Three.
While" putting the weight was in pro
gress the final heat of the 100-yard; race
was run. All the 1 men lined up were
Americans except Rowley, the Australian
champion. From the. crack T of â¢ the pistol
to the breasting of the tape the struggle
was desperate â¢ between Tewksbery and
Duffy. Pennsylvania and Georgetown
fought for every inch, Duffy flying in
ahead in even time. Rowley was fourth,
badly beaten. rf
The victory in the weight throwing con
test added another point to the American
score. Sheldon, who stood like a giant
among the putters, threw 1 44 feet 6 inches
on his first try. This was never Beaten,
and Sheldon won from the Irishman. Den
nis Horgan, without difficulty, although
the latter's record is over 48 feet. J. C
McCracken of the University of Pennsyl
vania, was third, with 39 feet 10 inches.
Oarrett of Johns Hopkins put 36 feet 9
inches. John Flanagan of the New York
Athletic Club, although present, did not
compete.
In the preliminary heat for the hurdles
A. C. Kraenzlein of the University of
Pennsylvania, easily beat Maloney of Chi
cago University In ir.14 seconds â the
world's record on grass. The crowd yelled
its delight at Kraenzlein's exhibition.
Pritchard of Bengal won his heat with
ease, defeating W. P. Remington of the
University of Pennsylvania, who fell at
the last hurdle.
In the flrst heat of the half-mile run
A. E. Tysoe. holder of the championship,
easily defeated his American competitors.
John Brady of Williams; College. Wil
liamston, Mass., was second and David
C. Hall of- Brown University was third.
Edward R. Bushness of the University of
Pennsylvania and Riley oÂ£ Boston entered
this heat, but did not run.
The second heat of the half-mile run
was captured comparatively easily by J.
B. Densham, who defeated Waiter E.
Drumheller of the University of Pennsyl
vania and Kdward A. MechlinK. also of
the University of Pennsylvania. Densham
seemed palpably to elbow Drumheller out
of his course and Drumheller protested
but the judges overruled him.
Captain Cregan of Princeton, though,
not up to his usual form, won his half
mile heat with ease, running beautifully
and beating H. E. Graham, the Cambridge
crack, by five yards. Harvey, H. I^ord of
Chicago University was third. â¢
. The high jump attracted little attention.
J. H. Leahy, the English and Irish cham
pion, whose record is 6 feet 4% inches,
could clear only 6 feet 7%, inches. J. K.
Baxter of the University of Pennsylvania,
creeping up to the bar, cleared with ease
6 feet 2 inches. But Walter Carroll of
Princeton could not rise above 5 feet 3>i
Inches and tied for second. place with â¢W.
B. Henderson of. Cambridge and P. O'Con
ner of Ireland. Baxter's jumping elicited
frequent cheers.
Kraenzlein Takes the Hurdles.
The final heats of the hurdles gave
America her fourth victory out of five
events. Kraenzlein walking away from
Prltchard and winning as he liked in 15 2-c
seconds. Nothing was ever' before seen
in England like Kraenzlein a lightning
flight and the crowd broke into loud ap
plause as the pride of Pennsylvania broke
the tape. Pritchard. the Indian champion,
was several yards behind.
In the quarter mile Chrisman Boardman
of the New York* Athletic Club failed to
win his heat. He was beaten by W. H.
Walsh, one of Scotland s best runners.
M. H. Long of the New York Athletic
Club won his- quarter mile heat as he
liked, beating William J. Holland or
Georgetown University, who was second,
and several British entries.
Maloney of Chicago University had a
walkover in his heat for the quarter mile,
Stanley Rowley of Australia, Harvey H.
Lord of Chicago University and Waite of
"Syracuse backing out. ' .
Another heat was won by C. G. Davl
son from Henry â¢ Berry Stack of Chicago
University. Davison. it will be remem
bered, ran for Cambridge and beat Board
man, the representative of Harrard-Yale.
Up to this stage the crowd, though num
bering about 3000 persons, had been sin
gularly undemonstrative. Now and again
"Rah. rah, rah," was heard from Penn
sylvania's supporters, but on the whole
the crowd was stolid. -
"The Americans are going to win" was
the general expression when the heats
started and it generally proved true.
In the meanwhile the four-mile run had
been finished In excellent time, but A. L.
Newton of the New York Athletic Club,
the only American who could stand the
pace, finished far behind the winner. In
the four-mile run America had five en
tries. . Alexander Grant of the University
of Pennsylvania, who apparently was
much "out -of Â¦form, gave up after a mile
and "Dick" Grant of Boston soon dropped
behind and; finally stopped.-- .
Simultaneously the hammer-throwing
and pole jump were in progress. 'John
Flanagan of the New York Athletic Club
astonished the spectators in "'the former
event. .His first throw was 161 -feet '2
Inches, while T. F. Klely, the -holder of
the championship, could reach" only 137
fÂ«et 7tÂ£ inches. J. C. McCracken of the
Univerlsty of Pennsylvania soon dropped
out. covering only 134 feet. T. Truxton
Hare of the University of Pennsylvania
did better, with 137 feet Vt inch.
Flanagan's Great Throw.
Proceeding with the hammer-throwing
Flanagan improved on his first throw by
two feet and won easily. Kiely could not
nearly touch his own record of 151 feet,
but just managed to beat Hare.
The final of the half-mile run was very
exciting. Princeton's captain, Cregan, led
until the last hundred pards. Then, amid
much excitement, Tysoe. the holder of
the championship, gradually overhauled
him 'and snatched victory from America
in comparatively poor time, which Cregan
would have beaten If he had been In any
thing like his usual form. But, like the
majority of the Tigers, he seemed to have
staled by his extended stay in England.
Kraenzlein had hard work in the long
jump. P. O'Connor, the Irishman, was a
close second, with 22 feet 4 X A inches, and
T. J. Leahy was third, with 22 feet 2
inches, while William F. Ilerington and
F. 15. McClaln, both of the University of
Pennsylvania, scored 21 feet 4 Inches and
21 feet \yz Inches, respectively.

AMERICAN ATHLETES SCORE
A GREAT TRIUMPH IN ENGLAND
The pate receipts at Union Coursing
Park yesterday were set aside to be added
to to-day's receipts, and the lump sum
v.ill be subscribed to the fund for the
benefit of the widow and children of Fire
nan John E. Sweeney. A *#ood crowd was
in attendance and was treated to a col
lection of fine races by evenly matched
doÂ»?s.-
The first upset of the day was the race
between Cronin's Thornhill and Taylor's
imported Mose. The latter hound was
played for a cinch, the talent offering as
Rood a-s 10 to 1 on his chances. Mose led
from the slips, but allowed Thornhill even
up the score. After the undecided Mose
receded to 5 to 3 In the betting, but was
never in the chase, Thornhill getting the
flag with a 5 to 2 score.
Another surprise was the defeat or tne
recent importation. Fine Fire, by Belle
Claire. Fine Fire took the lead and scored
the first five points. In the mix-up he
waited for the game to come to him and
allowed Helle to score seven points, while
he gained but one. Belle got the kill and
the decision. Fine Fire was favorite at
6 to 1.
The dogs left in the stake are quite
evenly matched and should furnish good
coursing to-day.

OUTWORKED BY
BELLE CLAIRE
NEW YORK, July 7.â Jack Point, with
109 pounds up and piloted by the Cali
fornia jockey Henry, ran the mile and a
quarter in the Brighton handicap to-day
in the record time of 2:04 3-5. winning the
rich stake in a hot drive with The Ken
tuckian and Imp. while the great Ethel
bert was lengths back. Klnley Mack, the
Suburban and Brooklyn handicap winner
of this year, was eighth, and Admiration,
the choice of all the trainers, was fourth.
It was a cracking race from start to fin
ish. Admiration carrying them all off their
feet for the first mile and then giving it
up. Salvator's crown was lowered and
Tony Aste, the bootblack king, won the
honors with his cast-off. Jack Point.
Ethelbert was the favorite all the time,
and when the horses went to the po:*t
Admiration was a strong second choice,
having been played down from 5 to 3 to 1.
Ethelbert was first away, with The Ken
tuckian second, Admiration third and the
others close up. Admiration covered the
second furlong in 11 1-5 seconds, making
the tirsit quarter to the stand In "23 3-5 sec
onds. At that point she had opened up a
gap of a lenjtth on Jack Point, which had
rushed up to and was a head in front of
The Kentuckian. The half was reached
in 47 3-5 seconds, and still the mare was
flying along in front. Five furlongs were
reeled off in l:01&
Inch by inch and then foot by foot The
Kentuckian began to draw up on Admira

The Kentuckian. as -the mare led only by
a head, and Imp and Kinley Mack were
coming fast. Thirteen seconds for the
seventh furlong gave Admiration and The
Kentuckian a heartache, but they stuck
gamely to their work and pegged away
at the next furlong, coming into the
stretch heads apart in the fast time of
1:39 2-Â».
But Administration was done to a turn
and The Kentuckian was nearly so. Then
came Imp from the rear, carrying her
great weight of 129 pounds as if it were a
feather, with Odom perched upon the big
saddle loaded with lead. He' worked with,
hands and heels to bring her to the front.
Down through the stretch they thundered
and the crowd yelled. First one horsa
and then another had the call.
Then came the shout. "Look at Jack
Point!" .for he was coming with a new
lease of life, and he passed them one after
another, until a furlong from home, in the
record time of 1:51. He was clear and
looked like a winner, barring accidents.
There were pood horses behind him.

JACK POINT'S
GREAT RUN IN
THE BRIGHTON
WHEN Al Neill and Jack Moffatt
meet within the roped arena
at Mechlncs' Pavilion next Fri
day night, the followers of the
fistic Â«port, thirsty for a good pugilistic
engagement, will probably be afforded an
opportunitv to see a fight that will tickle
the palate. Both principals have been
hard at work training for their second
meeting and the reports from their re
spective quarters tell of % good condition
and earnest intentions.
Al Neill is at' the Terminal. At this
resort all his indoor work Is done. Here
he boxes, skips the rope, beats the leath
ern bag. plays with dumb-bells, wrestles
and engages in mock battles every after
noon. The morning is given over to a
jog through the park with his trainers.
Neill likes to work and so fresh and full
of animation is he these days that his fol
lowers are in a high spirit of hope for vic
tory on the night of the fight. Neill does
not like to talk of his last engagement
with Moffatt. He was then the favored
fighter and his defeat was as disappoint
ing to his friends as to himself.
"No more overconfldence for me," says
the Californian, "I shall go into this
fipht with increased wisdom and a de
termination to beat my "man, and you
may bet I shall not throw chances of vic
tory away. It is for me to redeem mjv
self. Wnit for the fight and you will see
whether I shall do it or not."
Moffatt is at the Seal Rock House on
the beach. The salt air, the rambles
through the park and his bouts with Wil
lie Cole are bringing the Hush of perfect
condition to the skin of the Easterner.
furrowed thinking. "Will I or will I not?"
is the question.
Besides this fight between Neill and
Moffatt there will be another twenty
round go. Cole and Cox will let drive at
each other. Cox is an ambitious young
ster. He was tried out against a good
man last Thursday at the San Francisco
Athletie Club and the knowing ones say
he will give a good account of himself.
The youngster says he wants to try the
skill and mettle of Terry McGovern.
Rather ambitious, but indicative of the
proper spirit is this, Cox's, pugilistic de
sire.
He Is also confident that success will
crown his efforts when the game of brawn
and skill is on. He, too, has drunk of the
font or fistic wisdom. The previous bat
tle has taught him a lesson and he has
profound respect for the strong punch of
Neill and his reputed cleverness.
Though the training quarters of Neill
and Moffatt are separated by some little
distance, the men are constantly passing
each other in the park. â¢ It is always,
"ilello. Jack." and ."How-do-you-do.
Al?" That is the extent of their courte
sies. When each goes his contrary direc
tion there is some tall guessing and some
SNAPSHOTS AT THE MEN WHO ARE AGAIN READY fOTRY CONCLUSIONS.
AL NEILL AND JACK MOFFATT WILL
BE IN PRIME SHAPE FOR THE MILL
San Francisco 4, Stockton 2.
The change has come. -Hank's unlucky
nine has shattered the icecake of defeats
and won two straight victories by good,
<axeful fielding and timely stick work. As
the star performer on the stage of ill
fortune. Frisco gave way to Stockton yes
terday afternoon and Mr. Lockhead
played the premier part.
In the second Inning Lockhead's top
piece came in forcible contact with a hot
grounder from Krug's bat. and now the
Stockton man wears his head in a sling
that aJlows one lamp to burn and one
far to work for pounds. Mr. Whelan then
came ir.to the game and a change of posi
tions readjusted thÂ«Â» Stockton team.
Some pretty Infield work by Keilly, Krug
and Schwartz was the feature of the
game. \
The second inning was a bit of fireworks

Sullivan started out with a two-bagger,
taking third on Levy's mngle. Then Mr.
Harper went wild and Sully crossed the
rubber. Krug was the man who put
Ijockhtad out of business, at the same
time advancing Levy to third, while he

The catâ night-howling, bewhiskered

OAICLAXD, July 7. â There Is a vast
difference between the social stand-
Ing of the dakland cat and the
social standing of the Oakland Bel
gian hare nowadays. Time was, in the
ante-feline days, when the status of the
relations of these two quadrupeds toward
society was about on a par. The differ
ence then consisted principally of an un
equal distribution of ears, tail and whis
kers and market value.
B,ut toward the end of tho nineteenth
century the Belgian hare suddenly became
a prominent factor in the social economy
of animals in- general. He became the
nucleus for the formation of clubs, 'the
subject for the adulation of thousands,
and a halo was woven about his head.
The Belgian hare felt Justified in giving
the cat the complete overlook.
But now those things are all changed.
The star of the Belgian hare has set on
the horizon of the animal kingdom. He

CULTURE OF THE CAT IS THE
VERY LATEST FAD IN OAKLAND
0 OAKLAND, July 7.â The city of
Oakland will get permission to ex
amine some Of the books of the
Contra Costa Water Company and
the Contra Costa Water Company may
get the Injunction that It has asked for
against the city preventing the Council
from enforcing the low water rate or
dinance against which the Contra Costa
Water Company Is struggling.
Though Judge Hart, sitting in Oakland
to-day, did^ot positively make these rul
ings he announced that the only question
In his mind as to the examination of the
books was bow far he should grant the
permission. His intimations in the mat
ter of the Injunction were more uncertain.
These are the net results of a very long
day of very dry legal argument that be
gan at 10 o'clock in the morning and last
ed until after 6 o'clock in the evening.
The proceedings were extremely teechnl
cal and correspondingly dry.
The Contra Costa Water Company finds
Itself between the devil and the deep sea.
If it collects water rates under the low
rate ordinance, which it is fighting, it rec
ognizes that ordinance and is barred from
collecting any increase should It win its
fight for higher rates. If. it collects rates
under the higher rate of last year It Is
liable to have its franchises and its plant
itself forfeited under the provision of the
constitution. If it doesn't collect any water
rates at ail it will be compelled to supply
from its 'own pockets the money for oper
ating expenses, taxes and interest upon
its bonds.-
Either Act Would Involve Loss.
Either of these three acts would be un
pleasant in its results and would Involve
the loss of money to the corporation. As
loss of money is something teat the Con
tra Costa Water Company was never
known to regard with equanimity the rea
eon for the injunction application which
was filed last night and argued to-day is
verv apparent.
When the Contra Costa Water Company
went into this legal fight over the water
rates the only difficulty it saw In the way
was this inability to collect income enough
to carry it along during the litigation.
It hoped to hurry the litigation along so
that it would not run very far into this
fiscal year, but when it was met by the
demand of Special Counsel Hayne for the
city that he be permitted to examine the
books of the corporation all hope of a
speedy settlement vanished. The cor
poration officials hoped in their hearts
that this point might possibly be over
looked, but it was made a very prominent
part of the answer that was riled by At
torney Hayne for the city.
But the corporation decided that it must
have money, and when July 1 came
around and the new water rate ordinance
went into effect the oincials of the com
pany got out their bills as usual, but had
printed across the face thereof in red
ink a statement that they would collect
under the higher water rate ordinance of
last year, and If the court should hold
that the lower rate of this year was valid
the company Â¦would rebate to every rate
payer the difference between the two
rates. Thus they thought to quiet the
rate payers and get in their money.
Reckoned Without Their Host.
But the officials of the company reck
oned without their host. They were more
trusting than their attorneys, and when
the attorneys saw the bills with the re"d
indorsement under -which It was proposed
to collect money, they stopped the whole
transaction. They had learned that Rob
ert Y. Hayne was inclined to fight, and
they knew that such an act would at once
place them in the hands of Hayne so that
he could appiy forfeiture proceedings
whenever he chose. They reared the man
who had asked the trial Judge to step
down and out, and decided to take no
chances whatever.
So the bills with the little red indorse
ment were never issued, and the Contra
Costa Water Company has collected no
money for July. But money must be
had, and if the plan of the officials did
not prevail they insisted that the attor
neys must find them a way out, and so
the injunction proceedings were instituted
last night with the belief that If an in
junction Is granted preventing the city
of Oakland from putting the new low rate
ordinance into force that they .will find
some way by which they may collect
money under the old and higher rate.
"We have collected no money for July,"
said President J. H. T. Watkinson to-day.
"We did prepare bills with the Indorse-
Judge Hart finally announced his inten
tion of taking both matters under con
sideration for future decision.
Robert Y. Hayne took the position that
the application was Insufficient in that the
Council had no power to enforce the ordi
nance and nonce could npt be enjoined and
he asserted that the company wanted this
injunction merely to lend color of law to
its effort to collect money.
There was considerable argument as to
the setting of the date "for the trial,
which was finally fixed at September 17.
The argument on the Injunction proceed
ings lasted during the entire afternoon.
Attorney E. J. McCutcheon argued that
the water company would be gTeatly in
jured if they were compelled to collect
rates under the lower ordinance and
should this ordinance be declared void
they would never be able to collect the
lost balance. The most interesting por
tion of the argument for the Injunction
was the reading of a lot of signed Inter
views by the various Councilmen in which
they were made to say that they fixed the
water rates without due consideration and
that they all thought that a board of en
gineers ought to be appointed to fix val
ues. Mr. McCutcheon claimed that these
statements showed that . the ordinance
was void In that the Council did not prop
erly consider the value of the plant when
It was fixing rates.
Date for .Trial Set
"I am satisfied that the showing In this
matter is- suflicient to authorize the In
spection of "certain books, but as to how
far this inspection shall go I am not fully
decided. It seems to me that it will
justify the Inspection of the books show-
Ing the operating expenses, the tax ac
counts, the receipts and the original ex
pense accounts. I hope to be able to set
tle this by Monday night."
Judge Hayne in his argument took the
ground that the application for examina
tion was legitimate; that the very com
plaint filed by the water company, which
asserted that the plant of the corporation
was worth more than SS.OOO.OOO, showed the
necessitv for the examination of the books
by the city. He argued for the sufficiency
of the specification of books by his appli
cation and declared that if his descrip
tions were not sufficient then the statute
permitting the examination of books
might as well be abandoned.
Attorney A. A. Moore, for the corpora
tion, said that Mr. Hayne's second appli
cation was no more' specific than the
first; that it was totally insufficient and
that it was merely a fishing expedition on
the part of the city.
Then it was that Judge Hart outlined
his decision In this matter:
Must SeÂ« the Books.
"We have got to meet a monthly outgo
of about $10,000 for operating expenses
alone. This Includes nothing for better
ments or keeping up the extensive works.
We have also $175,000 a year interest upon
our bonds to meet, without including
taxes. This interest is due seml-an
nually, eo that how much of this we
would have to meet during this litigation
depends upon how long the. litigation
without Income lasts. If we don't pay
our interest then everything stops. This
is what we are fighting for in the Injunc
tion proceedings."'
When Judge Hart opened the session to
day he found three motions confronting
him. One was the motion of the city to
be allowed to examine the books of the
company. Another was a motion of the
Contra Costa Water Company to set the
case for trial and the third was the ap
plication of the Contra Costa Water Com
pany for an injunction to prevent the city
from putting the new ordinance in force.
The corporation wanted the Injunction
proceedings heard first, but Judge Hart
decided that the motions came in the or
der given and took up the motion for the
examination of the books.
"The carrying of this litigation Into the
present fiscal year leaves us. in this con
dition. We cannot turn our water off, and
we cannot collect money for what we
give. If we were in any other business
and the customers" refused to pay or could
not pay, we could stop the supply, but
this we cannot do In the case of water
served to the people, for the people have
got to have water.
Income Is Shut Off.
ment that we would rebate the difference
between the two rates if the lower ordi
nance was sustained, but our attorneys
would not allow us to put the bills out.
We have not collected a dollar since the
first of the month, though under ordi
nary circumstances we would have begun
collecting at once. ) Â¦

Friends of former Attorney General A.
Jj. Hart are much alarmed over the re
ports from the Uvermore Sanitarium con
cerning his condition. Fears are enter
tained that the patient's reason has been
impaired beyond recovery. Although in
perfect physical health General Hart has
not shown any improvement in his mental
condition since he was taken to the sani
tarium.-a couple of months ago.
Mrs. Hart was a visitor at the sanita
xium two days ago and was informed by
her husband's physician that his condition
was very aerlous. From that the report
that General Hart was dying became cur
rent the assumption being that the state
ment applied to the physical aspect of the
ease. That was not a fact, but If Is now
believed that General Hart's mind has
weakened to such an extent that he can
not benefit by further treatment.
The lawyer's condition. It is stated, has
lieen largely superinduced by excessive
cigar smoking. His case has been very
closely watched since he was sent to Llv
ermore. but nothing has occurred to give
any encouragement concerning his recov
ery. Â¦ j - ; -';V:.-- : >

The baby was found by the mother a
short time afterward dead at the bottom
of the tub. Doctors were Â¦ called," but the
infant was beyond resuscitation. The
mother was so overcome by the shock
that she was prostrated and Is now un
der a physician's care.
The sad accident occurred late In the
afternoon. The mother had been busy
with her household duties and had left
the little one In the back yard, safe, she
thought, from any danger. The tub was
standing in a corner and was kept full
of water to' prevent It from drying out In
the sun and leaking. Mrs. Papnek had
occasion to go out of doors, and noticed
that the baby was not in the yard. She
started at once to find the child and dis
covered her baby's body at the "bottom of
the tub, /completely covered by water.
A few minutes after the body was
found the father arrived home from
work. . and the distressing news was
broken to him.
Coroner Mehrmann was notified of the
accident and took charge of the body. An
inquest will be held.

The result was no reports got away that
night. Next morning they were examined
and countersigned without the alteration
of a word!
. Several pressmen had traveled across
country to hear it. and a general riish for
the wires took place when it was finished.
But tho President was cautious. He gave
orders that no reports should bo tele
graphed until he had scrutinized them.
This was intensely aggravating to (he
journalists, so a deputation waited on his
private secretary, and eventually reached
the great man himself. The pressing de
mands of latter-day Journalism were en
larged upon and argument brought to
bear to induce him to relent. He objected,
he questioned, he hesitated, he wavered,
then, eureka! he agreed to trust to Jour
j nallsstlc accuracy. Â» There was a pause.
The deputation had expressed its grati
tude and was on the point of withdraw
ing whrn â he changed his mind. "It sud
denly struck him that if a garbled ver
sion or a misplaced sentence reached
London "Kamberlain" would be at him
and credit him with utterances he never
I dreamed of. > f
Some weeks before the Bloemfontein
conference, says the London Chronicle.
President Kruger made a sneech at Rus
tenburg, the stronghold of Dopperdcm,
wherein he outlined a new Outlander pol
icy and Incidentally accused Mr. Cham
berlain of a disregard for the truth. It
was a historical speech, marking, as it
did. a noteworthy change In the Presi

Stoel Â¦wool, 'rtrcxluced fivft or sl% years
Bgro. Is a mnchine-produced material that
Is u.-e<l as a substitute for sandpaper. It
is composed of sharp-edged threads of
tteel. which curl up together like wool,
or somewhat as the wood fibers of the
(similar material known as excelsior curl
uj> together, though the Bteel Is very
much liner; the finest of it being not
r-iuch coarser than the coarsest of natural
wools. The steel wool Is put In packages
containing one pound each. These are
somt thing like rolls of cotton batting,
but smaller, making, rolled in paper and
open at the ends, a package perhaps flf
ti-en inches long and two or three inches
In dl.irr.tter.
Made in various degrees of coarseness,
eu-tl wool is put to a variety of uses, the
finer wools for polishing wood and metal,
end the coarser for rubbing down paint
und varnish. Jt Is oÂ£ten used on several
r pecial parts of work, while, for example,
on the tlat surfaces of a door a man
Â¦would u*e sandpaper with a block back of
It: for the moldings he would use steel
wool, which tits into the crevices and con
forms itself to irregular shapes. Such
v.ork can be <lone with steel wool far
more readily than with sandpaper, and it
Is used with like advantage on irrepnlar
end Fmall surfaces and on carved work.
Hesldes the steel wool there Is a coarser
material of the same kind called steel
rhavlngs. which is put to various us<Â»3 as
In taking off old paint or varnish, and in
polishing wood before painting, and It Is
used on bowling alleys and on floors for
rnoothlns and cleaning them.
Sandpaper clogs in use, steel wool
tircnks down. The wool Is commonly
UFed with gloves to keep the ends from
sticking Into the fingers.

Breaking 1 of the Knowles Trust
Said to Have Been the
â¢ Result of a Con
spiracy.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, July 7. (
Horaco TV. Phllbrook in his efforts to be
appointed guardian of the children of
James P. and Mary "Webster Merritt and
Frederick A. and Mary Brown Merritt to
day filed In the Superior Court an amend
ed petition for letters of guardianship,
charging various named and unnamed
persons with having formed a conspiracy
to defraud the Merritt children. Those
accused are Emll Xusbaumer, George W.
Reed, George N. Williams,- Henry C.
Campbell, A. A. Moore, Charles H. Lovell,
Myron T. Dusinbury, Edward Hackett,
Mack Webber and O. C. Miller.
Philbrook's principal charge is that the
breaking of the Knowles trust, which he
declares was established by Mrs. Cath
erine Garcelon for the benefit of her neph
ews and their children, w as accomplish
ed by a number of designing persons who
formed a gigantic conspiracy to defraud
the rightful heirs and despoil them of their
property. He asserts Â¦ that when the
Knowles trust was declared void the
property valued at about $400,000 was di
vided among the alleged conspirators.
James P. and Frederick A. Merritt are
said to have been placated by small sums
from the valuable trust fund.
The decision dissolving the Knowles
trust was rendered November 7, 1S95, by
Judge A. L. Frlck. According to Phil
brook, the case was an agreed deal de
signed to rob the heirs of Mrs. Garcelon.
The appointment of Emil Nusbaumer to
succeed Captain J. N. Knowles as trustee
Is also cited as a part of the general
scheme of despoliation. Nusbaumer is
said' to have never filed a. bond and that
no security was ever requested because
of the alleged mental incompetency of
James P. and Frederick A. Merritt.
At the time of the concoction of the al
leced plan to defraud, reads the petition,
James P. Merritt was living at the home
of his fatherrin-law. Myron F. Dusinbury,
and was under his complete control, lo
carry out the fraud a deed was executed
on November C. 1S96, by C. C. Miller as at
tornev for the heirs of Stephen Purlngton
and Harrv P. Merritt, pretending to con
vey to Edward Hackett and Mack Web
ber all the real property of the Knowles
trust. Dusinbury is said to have ac
knowledged the deed in his capacity as
a notary public and caused it to be re
corded On November 7. 1S%, a Bimilar
deed is declared to have been executed
bv Frederick A. and James P. Merritt to
riackett and Webber. .... . ,
It is further alleged that by careful
planning a judgment of court was ob?
talnod ordering the division of the proper
ty under the control of Emil Nusbaumer
as successor to Trustee Knowles. All of
the proceedings are said to have been
carried out In one day;
The petitioner charges that the parties
to the alleged conspiracy received the fol
lowing amounts in dividing up the
Knowles trust property: George N. Wil
liams, property valued at $50,000; O. C.
Miller, property valued at $50,000; Henry
C. Campbell, property valued at $10,000;
Myron T. Dusinbury, property valued at
$30,000; Charles H. Lovell. property val
ued at $5000; Edward Hackett and Mack
Webber, property valued at $15,000; Harry
P. Merritt, property tvalued at $25,000;
Charles K. Palmer, property valued at
$12,500; Frederick A. Merritt. LouisÂ«
Brown Merritt, James P. Merritt and
Mary Webster Merritt. several pieces of
property and notes and mortgages of un
known value: A. A. Moore, $5000; George
W. Reed. $5000; the Purington heirs,
unknown amount; Emil Nusbaumer,
property valued at $25,000. Â¦
The application of Horace W. Phllbrook
for tho guardianship of the Merritt chil
dren comts up for hearing next Tuesday.
This petition Is In line with an attack
which Phllbrook has made In general and
specific terms upon thÂ» administration of
the Knowles trust. He has chaxged both
Fred and James Merritt with being men
tally Incompetent. He has gone Into
court with a petition to be declared
guardian of the Merritt children, and in
his charges to-day has Involved the
names of men who stand high In the
professional and financial world. Trus
tee Nusbaumer has had a copy of the
charges in his hands for several weeks,
and has pronounced them to be false in
every particular. He declares that they
will be met at every point, and he Is sat
isfied they will not hold In court.
Charges Filed by Him in
Amended Petition for
Guardianship.
PHILBKOOK SAYS
MERRITT HEIRS
WERE DEFRAUDED
Incorporated mining companies In the
United States paid over $40,000,000 in dli
dends during the first half of this calen
dar year. There are many companies not
Incorporated which made no reports, con
sequently $40,000,000 falls far below tho
actual aggregate of earnings. The show
ing for the mineral industry is certainly
very favorable.
A. Van der Nalllen writes from Paris
that next to the mineral exhibit of the
United States at the exposition comes that
of Russia, In native gold the latter dis
play comes far from equaling the dis
play of the United States: In all other
minerals it Is on a parity. The richness
of the Iron ores surpasses that of tho
American part of the show.
There are exhibits from the ledges of
Laplandâ magnetite. The general collec
tion represents an area of country reach-
Ing to Persia and India and embraces min
erals of all sorts. Italy exhibits beautiful
marbles. France and Germany rank at
the mineral show next to America and
Russia. Their exhibits of precious ores
are ordinary, but they are very strong in
coal, iron, zinc, antimony and manganese.
Dr. J.-Â£)bly has written a very interest
ing article concerning ozokerite, which ap
pears In the Mining and Scientific Press.
He says that there are only two ozokerite
mines of any magnitude In the world, al
though claims of recent discoveries have
been made in different parts of the United
States. Ozokerite is especially valuable
on account of the parafnne wax and par
afflne oil contained in it In considerable
quantities. The principal deposits are in
Gallcla and in Utah. The mineral has
also been located In Moldavia, a
northern province of Roumanla, In
the vicinity of coal and rock salt.
Originally ozokerite was discovered In
Galicia by a prospector who was
searching for petroleum- It Is said by
authorities on the subject that as the
American ozokerite cannot be applied at
present to the manufacture of cera-
Ein, no method having as yet b<>en
devised for that purpose, Its utiliza
tion has been limited mostly to the
production of parafflne. parafflne oil
and okonlte. Besides these uses t
finds, however, application in the manu
facture of varnishes, heavy lubricants
and blacking, serving furthermore as a
welcome material for calking ships, so
that it commands a steady price in the
Eastern market. It Is quoted at present
In New York at 8 cents per pound for the
foreign article and at 6 cents for the do
mestic product, transportation from Utah
to the seaboard amounting to $27 per ton.
Deducting mining and refining expenses
and cost of transportation there remains
sufficient margin to render the working
of the deposits remunerative and to en
courage further prospecting for the min
eral These favorable conditions are. still
enhanced by the Imminent exhaustion
of the Boryslaw mines, already reported
from time to time, so that finally the
Utah deposit will represent the only
source from v nlch t0 su PP lv t ] ie 1 in " k ,1 t
unless new discoveries are made In Cal -
fornia. Utah or Colorado, for which Indi
cations are favorable. iii'ii

The Geological Survey, in making prepa- |
rations for its exploration in 1901. has de
cided upon a reconnoissance of Koyukuk
River to the Arctic Ocean. The head
.waters of the Kovukuk River north of the
Arctic circle were partially explored by a
party under Mr. SchTiOer in the season
of 1S99. Between the Koyukuk and the
shores of the Arctic Ocean there Is a dis
trict of which little is known and to which
explorations should be extended.
The usual exploitation of ore bodies has
been carried on In accordance with rules
which the experience of the individual has
pointed out, according to Charles R. Keyes
in the Engineering and Mining Journal.
Where an operator, untrained In scientific
earth lore, begins mining In an unde
veloped district his method of attacking
the various problems presented is likely to
be based on observations made elsewhere.
He may hit upon the right nlan at once,
but the chances are ten to one that he will
not. Only after repeated trials and many
failures and much useless expenditure of
time does he finally get satisfactory re
sults. On the other hand, says Mr. Keyes,
when a specially trained geologist under
takes to make an investigation of a min
ing property he first gets all his bearings
with regard to the geological structure of
the region and the distribution of the rock
formations. Thus he eliminates many
chances of failure before he begins opera
tions.
Mr. Keyes attempts to classify ore de
posits, and some points are taken from his
generalization, a^ follows:
The chief feature wherein the classlflcatory
scheme presented differs from others is in the
prominence given to geological occurrence and
the direct operation of the geological processes
as essential factors in the genesis of the ore
"The"' nearest possible approach to a purely
genetic classification of ore deposits Is believed
to be found in their geological relationships,
and not in their direct chemical formation or
physical shapes.
The chemical reactions so widely used a?
criteria of ore classification are to be regarded
as general agencies, and therefore they are not
available In the specific determinations of the
croups of ore bodies.
In the discovery and exploitation of ores
structure Is of first Importance; not so much
the structure of the Individual ore body itself
as the geological structure of tho enclosing
country rocks.
The primary groupings appear to be best lndl-,
cated when based upon the geological occur-
Upon the recommendation of the director
of the Geological Survey the Secretary of
the Interior has authorized the organiza
tion of a third party, which will consist
of W. J. Peters, topographer, and W. C.
Mendenhall, geologist, with a sufficient
number of camp hands and canoes for a
topographic and geologic reconnoissance
of the Cape Nome belt. This party will
be conveyed by the Coast Survey steamer
to Good Hope Bay, where it will be land
ed, and proceed to the northeastern por
tion of Seward Peninsula, returning
across the' neck of the peninsula by Buck
land River to Norton Bay.
In co-operation with the Coast and Geo
detic Survey It has been arranged that
Mr. Barnard's party shall complete the
triangulatlon between Â»Golofnin Bay and
Port Clarence.
Great expectations are entertained in
Alaska concerning the extensive geolog
ical surveys to be made this year. The
principal survey will be in the Nome dis
trict and will extend from Fish River to
Cape Nome and Port Clarence, and will
also Include a reconnoissance of the Cape
York district. The Alaska Record-Miner
of June 16 says that according to the best
information available, surveys intended to
define the extent of the gold-bearing area
in the southern portion of the Seward pe
ninsula, between Cape Nome and Fish
River, should cover an area between 3000
and 4000 square miles in extent. For this
survey two parties will be organized â one
topographic and the other geologic. The
topographic party will be placed in charge
of E. C. Barnard, with one assistant to
pographer and a sufficient number of
camp hands to permit of distinct opera
tions in the field by two offlcers. This
Is necessary in order to cover the re
quired area in a given time. The survey
is made on the scale of four miles to the
Inch, with sketch contours In a manner
similar to that executed by Mr. Barnard
in the Forty-Mile district in the summer
of 1898.
clan deposit Is characterized by the pres
ence of clay, salt and sandstone, which in
connection with the occurrence of petro
leum represent the ideal conditions under
which the existence of ozokerite becomes
probable. Broken rock strata and saddle
formations are considered, furthermore,
as indications favorable to the presence of
the mineral. Judging largely from the
character of the two localities In which
ozokerite deposits of any magnitude have
been found.

The officers of Fideltty Circle No. 203
of the Companions of the Forest were also
installed last Monday night by Mrs. Fer
nandez. D. D. S. G. C. C, of Justice Cir
cle, assisted by several of the supreme
grand officers. They are:
Mrs. Croal, the Junior past chief com
panion, and two magnificent bouquets. to
the new chief, Mrs. Zelslng, and then
there was an adjournment to the banquet
room, where supper Â¦was served, John Fal
coner acting as, toastmaster.
The Sonora Union-Democrat says that
preparations are being made on a large
scale at the Goodwin mine: also that the
Yosemlte Mining Company will have
water on its gravel claims in the Gravel
Range district soon. Another plant has
been completed at the Black Oak to treat
sulphurets.
The Redding Searchlight says that Jo
seph A. Kahny and Dr. F. M. Archer
have purchased two odd sections from the
railroad company near Redding, and be
lieve that they have secured a tin mine.
A cattleman riding on a range picked up
a queer specimen of ore. took it to Red
ding and gave it . to Dr. Archer. Then
Kahny and Archer hunted until they
found what they believe to be a tin de
posit. They have sent samples of the ore
to an assayer.
Phil Keefe of Sonora and his associates
In San Francisco have bonded the Saddle
Buttes, In Tuolumne County. Active op
erations have been resumed at the Good
win mine. Drifting north and south is
progressing at the Ida Dell.
The owners of the Golden Eagle mine at
Jenny Lind, Calaveras County, are report
ed to have made a rich strike. The Ozark
mine, between Murphys and Angels, may
soon be In operation. Stock will be of
fered to raise money. A part of 50.000 feet
of timber ordered for the Commodore
mine, to be used In the shaft as sinking
progresses, has arrived. There Is a lull
in mining activity in the vicinity of Jesus
Maria.
At least $20,000 will be expended at once
on the Fremont and Gover mines. The
new shaft of the Fremont Is down a little
over 300 feet. At a certain depth, not yet
decided upon, crosscuttlng will be done
from the shaft to the vein. The old Gover
shaft will be emptied of water and re
timbered and a sixty-stamp mill will be
erected midway between the Gover and
Fremont. In the Amador Queen No. 1.
at Jackson, Superintendent Dye is fixing
up additional stamps and concentrates,
and Is making preparations for stoplng at
the C00 level.
News comes from Amador as follows
A 1200-foot flume has been erected to
operate the Pay Streak mine on the east
side of Humbug- Canyon, about one mile
above the Dorer settlement. A crew of
men is working the Pleasant and Amer
ican Ear River mine, on the middle fork
of the American River, below Michigan
BlufT. J. L. Grimes has*become the su
perintendent of the Bellevue Consolidated
quartz mine at Ophlr. The three-stamp
mill at the Rawhide mine, on Texas
Ridge, is running steadily. Eighteen men
are employed at the Prairie Flower
quartz mill at Canada Hill.
The source of the ore materials is an unes
sential factor in their classlllcation. The great
practical question is, how are ores best ex
ploited? In this connection it matters little
what was the original condition of the ores.
Nor have we to do very much with the de
tailed, complex and usually theoretical chemi
cal reactions that are supposed to take place
before the final stage of the ores as we find
them !s reached.
Very similarly appearing ore bodleÂ« may be
formed by very dltTerent method?: a fact, while
apparent In all classifications, does not neces
sarily vitiate any.
The Yfjka Journal says that the Amer
ican Bar Company has started another
wing dam at their claim /on Klamath
River, below Ash Creek. The Gladstone
mine at French Gulch has been purchased
by Roberts. Jillson & Mclntosh and it will
'soon bfe reopened on a large scale. The
snow on the mountain summits has near
ly disappeared. The Commonwealth mine
has been leased for a term of years from
a San Francisco company. A new com
pany has been organized to operate a
mine on Scott Mountain, In Sisklyou
County, near the Shasta and Sl.skiyou
County lines.
Some notes from Placer County are as
follows:
rence of the ore bodies, as governed by the
kind of geological processes operating.
The secondary groupings are best based upon
the general form of the ere bodies as eeolo
elcal formations produced by the grander cate^
gortes of the geological agencies.
The ternary groupings are best based upon the
specific phases of the geological processes in
volved in the formation of ores as ore bodies.

from foreign points deerskins are plentiful and
selling slowly; goatskins sell readily. Wool

CHICAGO. July 7.â When the Wheat market
started to-day's business among other things
in consideration were Kood rains in thÂ« Norfh
w<?st. Ab to whether thepe rains would rescus
the perishing crop in the portions of that
section where the Spring Wheat Is not al
ready numbered with the dead was a matter
of controversy. The opinion that lt did some
pood caused a considerable drop at the open
ing, which was at 73->4tr79%c for August. In
the meanwhile Liverpool was resting after a
day's work *i@ld over the previous session,
and later there appeared statistics showing a
Email batch of recelpts_ at the big markets.
The trade changed its views for a moment
after digesting the situation and ambled up
to S<Hic That was as high as the market got.
The rains, together with some messages of a
cheerful sort from the Spring Wheat country,
animated the trade into selling of various
sorts and under this pressure August slid off
to 7&Uc. An English cable prophesying smaller
world's shipments would be shown In Mon
day's report, together with a lighter South
weytern movment. as shown by receipts,
caused a reaction from the bottom to 7S T Â«c, but
some of this was lost and the closÂ» was ea*y,
August closing J 4'3?ic undrr yesterday at TS^c.
Corn fold off on the prediction o f ra ) n f or
Kansas and NÂ«"braFka, where hot weather and
scorching winds have been hoMlnit forth. The
market rose a bit from the bottom on eome
buying by Western interests*. Trade was rath
er active. August clo?ed *i$?%c down.
Oats were steady without any particular
trarte. August eloped 'ic up.
Provisions were dull and easy, partly with
the cereals, but mostly on the letting out Gf
long stuff. Hog receipts were light an<i there
was a fairly good fcattered demand through
the commission house. September Pork closed
10tz-12'4c under yesterday. Lard 2Vi'3Sc lower

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
Prunes are higher and are getting very

of the question.
Apricots continue steady and predictions of a
decline have not yet been fulfilled. In fact. If
the dried fruit market acts like the green fruit
market this year all predictions of low prices
will come to naueht. The fruit market la sur
prising the oldest heads in the business this
year by Its firmness. "
- Quotations for new Peaches are still hanging
fire and there is nothing said about the prices
of new Prunes. The Prune Association -â¢ is
tteadlly gaining members and at the present
rate of progress will very soon embrace prac
tically the whole acreage of the State.

cier says: The statement of the New Tork
Clearing-house banks for the week ending July
7 was in direct conflict with all preliminary es
timates.
Theoretically the banks should have exhibited
a heavy gain !n cash, owing to receipts from
the interior and treasury disbursements. In
stead of that, however, cash holdings were re
duced J2.S70.30". There was no explanation as to
this falling off. but it is probably true that the
July dividend period has confused the averages.
It is only fair to infer that the position of the
Clearing-house institutions is much stronger
Ajian the statement indicates, for receipts have
reen heavy the past few days. The interesting
feature of the week's operations Is the decrease
In the loan item, the reduction for the week
having been $3,57S,C00. This makes a total de
crease of $7,135,900 from the hlgrh point 'reached
June 23. and there is reason to believe If the
movements of the past years afford a precedent
that the lean total will continue to decrease
until well into the fall season. The contraction
of $6.400. 5W In deposits Is not as large as called
for by the exchanges, but It sets free $1,600,000
heretofore locked up in legal reserve require
ments, and this accounts for the falling off of
only Jl,27i),175 in EurDlJS, in the face of an
actual loss of f2.S7O.3OO In cash. The future
money market Is rather uncertain. The loaning
rate, in view of present conditions of surplus
reserve, is abnormally low, but there Is a no
ticeable tendency to put out only short time
loans. The expanded loan account can be traced
to Investments In Efrllng, and this means that
a rise in rates, should one *ccur, will be met
by liquidation of foreign accounts and an. im
port of gold. But so iar as explanation en this
ground, attempts are being ma.de even now to
negotiate additional foreicn loans- It Is also
known that within the next few days receipts
from the Klondike will be transferred to New
York. So fur as the crop season demands are
concerned there is absolutely nothing to show
that m^ney is going West. In fact, the move
ment is the other war.

a snag was struck. The Penal Code pro
vides that in all felonies and Indictable
misdemeanors the evidence must be taken
and the witnesses must sign the recogni

provides that tne evidence shall be taken
on preliminary examinations for felonies.
Stenographer Long refused to take the
evidence in the Ham Dung case, in view
of the charter provision, and the Judge
had to admit that he was right. A con
tinuance was granted till to-morrow to
see if a way can be found out of the

husband had told her that when Sorres

to give her $1 DO per week to live on. and

Defends Public Improvement Central
GREENSFELDER WRITES
REPLY TO DEN MAN
Borne hours after McGlade's case was
Bubmltted to the *ury for decision that
body returned Into court and found the
defendant guilty of having uttered the
warrant, but made no mention of the
charge that he had forged the same. T.
J. Lennon. who undertook the defense of
the accused, immediately reached the
conclusion that this verdict was contrary
to the evidence, and upon this and other
points filed the motion for a new trial.
In the opinion granting the motion Judge
Cook says:
. There â¢was absolutely no evidence at all â not
a ecintlllaâ as to defendant's having passed the
warrant set forth in the Indictment, unless It
be the opinion of the witness Kytka, a hand
writing expert, that the signature. "T. Dwyer,"
to the receipt on the back of the warrant, was
written by the defendant. The Jury may have
acted upon the opinion of Kytka, but in the
case of Buckley, the Supreme Court of this
State has intimated that where a conviction
rcrts solely upon the opinion of an expert wit
ness the evidence was Insufficient, and in an
other recent case appealed from Santa Barbara
County, In which a conviction rested solely
upon the testimony of this same witness, Kyt
ka. the Judgment was reversed.
Upon the second question presented on this
motion." viz. : the action' of the prosecuting
counsel In commenting. In argument, upon the
failure of the defendant to testify as to cer
tain facts. I am satisfied that such action
upon the part of the prosecuting counsel was
prejudicial to the rlEhts of the defendant and
would, nhould he appeal from a Judgment
herein, cause the Supreme Court to reverse
said Judgment.
The third point presented on t'.ris motion pre-
Peter TV. McGlade. charged with the
embezzlement of Street Department
funds, has won another point In his bat
tle for liberty. Judge Cook: has granted
him a new trial on three grounds. The
court holdsâ first, that the verdict Is con
trary to law and against the evidence;
second, that the conduct of counsel for
the prosecution during the course of ar
gument was prejudicial to the rights of
"the defendant and that through comment-
Ing on the defendant's failure to testify to
certain facts, error was committed; third,
misconduct of the Jury in reading certain
newspaper articles set forth In an affi
davit flled In the motion for a new trial
on behalf of the defendant- The news
paper that published the articles and
thus rendered null the verdict, as far as
Judge Cook's opinion goes, is severely
dealt with.

senta a Question which ought to 'be carefully
considered by the Appellate Court of the State
and BOine rule laid down by that tribunal
whereby trials In our court* of Justice phall
not be Interfered with by the prfas. The ques
tion here presented is not the Impeachment of
a verdict by the Jurore, but the affidavits pre-
Fented present to the court certain facts from
which It Is clear to be, seen that Improper In
fluence surrounded the jury during the trial
and during. their consideration of their verdict
In this caee. On the morning after the jury
Â¦vras completed. Impaneled and sworn, three of
the Jurons arose in the Jury-box and requested
to be excused from service upon the Jury be
cause of an article that had appeared In one
of the dally newspapers (the Examiner) In
this city which they considered reflected upon
their Integrity.
One of these Jurors, as the record shows,
announced to the Judge before the opening of
court. In chambers, that he desired to be ex
cused from service on account of said newspa
per article, giving as a reason that he was
seeking employment under the city government,
and that In view of the article he feared it
might affect his application. The court had no
power to excuse the Jurors at that time, without
by so dolnc virtually accqulttlng the defend
ant, for the reason that they had been impan
eled and sworn and Jeopardy had attached.
Their request to be excused was therefore de
nied. Subsequently the restrict Attorney made
a motion that the entire Jury be discharged,
which motion was heard by the court, assisted
by two other Judges of this court, all three
Judges agreeing that the Jury having been
.sworn, jeopardy had attached, and a discharge
of the jury meant an acquittal of the defend
ant upon the charge. The District Attorney's
motion was therefore denied and the trial pro
ceeded with. I fail to see any difference be
tween a communication of that sort to a Juror
after he is sworn and a communication by word
of mouth. In both Instances a Jurcr sworn In the
cause has been communicated with upon mat
ters relative to the cause whlch.be has been
sworn to try and. as the record here shown. In
timidated in such a manner as to affect any
verdict that he might render. In addition to
this instance of articles appearing In the press
during the course of the trial, the record fur
ther shows, not only by affidavits but by evi
dence Introduced by the District Attorney hlm-
Eelf on the motion for a new trial, that a cer
tain newspaper article was read aloud in the
Jury-room while the Jury were considering
their verdict in this cause and passed around
among the Jurors. That article intimidated, if
it did not in distinct terms state, that If the
Jury failed to convict this defendant It ,waa be
cause they were corrupt.
Had thÂ« editor of that paper (the Examiner)
or the reporter thereon gone Into the Jury
room while the Jury were considering their ver
dict in the cause and stated to them orally
what was contained In that newspaper arti
cle, there can be no question at all but that
any verdict rendered by cuch Jury would, with
out a moment's hesitation, be set aside by any
court on the face of the earth. What differ
ence exists between an oral communication of
that nort and a printed one I am unable to
discern.
j If I am wrong in this matter the Supreme
Court can correct me by setting aside, the
order that I am about to make, and sentence
can then be pronounced and no harm come from
my order, either to the people or to the de
fendant, and I certainly hdpe that the Dis
trict Attorney will appeal from the order made
to that tribunal, and I earnestly request him
so to do, for I feel that a decision should be
procured from that court which will authori
tatively announce to the' press of the State
that If they will persist In attempting to try
in their columns causes on trial In our courts
and to Influence and intimidate Jurors verdicts
rendered where such Interference has been had
will he set aside. â¢ .
No individual would dare to address a Juror
upon matters being tried by him. yet it has
come to be a dally occurrence for those writ
ing for the daily press to communicate, through
the columns' of the press, that which they
would not dare to communicate by word of
mouth.
