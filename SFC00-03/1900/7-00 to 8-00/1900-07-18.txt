PETERSBURG, July 17 (Censored by Russian Government). â There is no doubt
ft,ja now that China has declared war against Russia. Hostilities are beginning, the end ol
â¢-._ which it is impossible to see.
Probably it will require a long time for the truth to filter through to Europe, but the sit
uation in Eastern Siberia is extremely grave â as critical, indeed, as it well can be. The Boxers
. â or. rather, the regular Chinese troops (for these are doing the real fighting) â have seized a
Russian transport boat, laden with munitions, near Aigun, on the River Amur, and fired on and
killed almost the entire Russian escort. They next made a sudden attack upon Blagoveschensk,
bombarding the town. The garrison held out bravely, but was overwhelmed, and nearly all per
ished. The town was burned.
It was on July I that the news readied the general staff that this declaration of war had
: been made by China at the town of Aigun. on the Amur. In consequence of this General Gri
bovski attempted to push his way through to Aigun on the steamer Gelenga, but found at that
point, twelve miles from Aigun, further progress barred by the Chinese, who had thrown up
fortifications, in which had. been placed forty guns. Consequently he had to relinquish the at-"
The situation in Manchuria has become very critical since the bombardment of Blagoves
chensk and the holding up of the Russian transport with munitions. On the Eastern Siberian
Railway almost all the stations have been burned to : the ground, bridges destroyed and tracks torn
up. The Russian Consul at Kulttsha has telegraphed urgently for reinforcements.
-- NEW YORK, July 17. â The Journal has this from St. Petersburg: China's acts of hostil
ity in Manchuria are considered tantamount to a declaration of war against Russia, even if the for
mal declaration has not already been made.
Leading firms of Moscow received news that their warehouses filled with tea and silk at
Kalgan had been plundered and burned by the Chinese. The goods destroyed were valued Â»at
$5,000,000.

FORTY FOREIGNERS REPORTED KILLED
IN A LATE MASSACRE AT TAI YUEN-FU
Minister Wu Receives a Cablegram Signed
by Director Sheng and Two Viceroys De
claring That Foreigners in Peking Were
Still Safe on the Ninth of July.
& ASHIXGTOX, July 17. â The Chinese Minister has received a dispatch from the Chinese Minister at London, authen
fiJ/Bf ticated by Sheng. the Imperial Inspector of Telegraph and Posts at Shanghai, and by two Viceroys, declaring that the
foreigners in Peking were safe on July 9, and were receiving the protection of the Government. This is two days after the
reported massacre. Minister Wu has laid the message before Secretary Hay. It- is as follows:
"The utmost efforts have been made to protect foreign Ministers, who were
well on the 13th (Chinese calendar, corresponding to our July 9). If the city of Tientsin
should be destroyed it would be difficult to restore the same in 1OO years. Requestthe
powers to preserve it, as the consequences would affect Chinese and foreign com
merce. Earl Li Hung Chang is transferred to North China as Viceroy to Chi Li. Please
transmit this dispatcn to the Ministers at other capitals/'
This dispatch, which is dated July 16, was signed by Viceroys Liu Kun Yi and Chang Chih Tung of Nanking and Wu
Chang, respectively, and also by Sheng, director of posts and telegraphs at Shanghai. It was addressed to the Chinese Minis
ter in London, and by him transmitted to Minister Wu under to-day's date.
Minister Wu received the dispatch about 11 o'clock this morning, and was greatly pleased at the satisfactory turn of
events. He started at once for the State Department, where he remained with Secretary Hay for some time. Besides pre
senting to Mr. Hay the contents of his dispatch, Minister Wu also officially executed the direction for an appeal to the powers
not to destroy the walled city of Tientsin. So far as the United States is concerned, there has been no purpose to wantonly de
stroy this walled city, although the latest news from the scene of action indicates that the walls themselves have been battered
down and a considerable portion of the city destroyed. Mr. Wu said afterward that he feared the destruction of the city was little i
short of complete.
The Minister expressed the most complete confidence in the accuracy of the message showing that the foreign Minis
ters were well on the, 9th inst. When a bystander expressed some doubt on this subject, Mr. Wu inquired with some warmth:
"Why is it you believe the exaggerated reports coming from unknown sources and yet you choose to doubt this report,
signed by our highest officials and containing: inherent evidence of accuracy?" â¢
The Minister went on to show that this dispatch contained three distinct statements. One of them, the appointment of
Li Hung Chang as Viceroy of Chi Li, had been confirmed already by the State Department. Moreover, he said, all three state
ments bore evidence of having originated at Peking, including that as to Li Hung Chang, whose appointment necessarily must
originate with the Government at Peking. â¢
The State Department officials are anxious to accept Wu's message as accurate, but there are some clouds of doubt
about it. The question naturally arises, as it has many times in the past two weeks, If the Chinese Government can communi
cate in this way with its representatives abroad, why can it not permit the foreign Ministers represented to be under its protection
also to communicate with their governments? In answer to another question as to what purpose would be served by a misrepre
sentation of facts in this fashion, it is pointed out that one result desired by the Chinese would be the preservation of Tientsin,
and another would be the abatement of the popular resentment against the Chinese â temporarily at least. Li -Hung Chang will
replace as Viceroy of the great province of Chi Li a man who has been notoriously anti-foreign in his sentiments and actions.
0 ' ffcASHIXGTOX, July 17. â Admiral Remey this morning cabled the Navy Department that the city and forts of Tien
gUtJ^ir. are in the hands of the allies. His list of killed and wounded is somewhat fuller than yesterday's report, but still
not entirely complete. His dispatch follows:
"CHEFU, July 17. â To-day hope to get wounded from Tientsin either in hospitals at Taku or aboard Soiace. Com
munication very uncertain. Following casualties apparently confirmed:
"Marines â Captain Davis killed: Captain Lemley, Lieutenants Butler and Leonard wounded.
"Army â Colonel Liscum killed; Majors Reagan and Lee, Captains Noyes, Brewster and Bookmiller, Lieuten
ants Xaylor, Lawton, Hammond and Waldron wounded. Total killed and wounded reported, 775. Russians and Japanese lost
heavily. Our total loss reported. 215. About forty marines, but number believed to be exaggerated. Have officer on shore
especially to get authentic number of names, which will be promptly telegraphed. City and forts now in hands of allies. Admiral
Sevmour returned to fleet. Officer ashore is 1 Admiral Alexiefif at Tientsin. REMEY."
This bulletin was received at the Navy Department early this morning and was copied for distribution about 9 o'clock.
Before it was given out it was decided to make some change in the copy, the nature of which was not disclosed, and the fore
going was finally given to the public.
Admiral Remey Confirms the News of the
Tientsin Victory and Reports Heavy Loss
Sustained by American Soldiers and
Marines in the Attack.
"When the arsenal had been evacuated by the Chinese the Americans, French and Japanese and Welsh Fusiliers advanced toward the native city and joined with the other attacking forces. The Japanese infantry and mounted
battery advanced to the foot of the walls, supported by the Americans and French. Despite valiant attacks, the allies were only able to hold the positions gained outside the walls preparatory to renewing the assault in the morning.
"The casualties sustained by the allies were exceedingly heavy, especially those to Americans, French and Japanese. Several explosions in the native city were caused by the bombardment. The Chinese appear to have ex
hausted their supply of smokeless powder, as they are now using black powder.
"The guns of the allies did immense damage to the native city, causing many large conflagrations and finally silenced the majority of the enemy's guns simultaneously. Then 1500 Russians, assisted by small parties of
Germans and French, assaulted and captured eight guns that were in position on the railway embankment and the fort, the magazine of which the French subsequently blew up. A body of American, British, Japanese and Austrian troops
then made a sortie and attacked the west arsenal, which the Chinese had reoccupied. After four hours of the hardest fighting yet experienced, the Chinese fled.
XONDON, July 17. â The Shanghai correspondent of the Daily Mail sends the following, under date of July 17:
"The allied troops resumed the attack upon the Chinese walled city of Tientsin on the morning of July 14 and succeeded in breaching the walls and captured all the forts.
"The Chinese were completely routed and the allies took possession of the native city and its defenses. .
"The total losses of the allies in the engagement of Thursday. Friday and Saturday were about 800 killed and wounded. The casualties were greatest among the Russians and Japanese.

VALLEJO, July 17. â Commander Frank
lin J. Drake, long of Mare Island, has
been ordered to China on August 1. Com
mander Drake has been the ordnance of

was his foresight that enabled this Gov
ernment to furnish Admiral Dewey with
ammunition, at that critical time when

This morning's news of the success of
the allied forces at Tientsin, though that
success has been dearly bought, appears
to clear the air somewhat. This victory
over the Chinese, it is hoped, will enable
the allies to resume pfeparatrons for an
advance, especially as to-day it is official
ly announced that the Japanese force of
22,900 will all be disembarked by July 19
at the latest. The suggestions of scatter
ing the forces throughout China in pur
suit of the Boxers emanate wholly from
irresponsible quarters. In official circles
there Is a full realization of the neces
sity of having the coast towns occupied
and pecure before proceeding to Peking.
The only course open to the powers is to
remain in the capital until fanaticism
Â¦wears itself out and the elements of an
orderly native government begin to
emerge.
According to a Shanghai dispatch pub

armed with Mauser rifles and modern ar

within forty miles of Shanghai, ready to

, To the American Consul, who had in
quired about accurate intelligence con
cerning the actual safety at this date ot
the foreign Ministers, the Viceroy an
swered that he had had no news from
Peking within the last week. His pre
vious advices had assured him then of
their safety. It they were alive he was
almost certain th.it matters could bÂ© sat

ers.
"If they are dead"â here he shrugged
his shoulders significantly and added with
lowered voice â "it is hard to tell what
may happen. I am going to Peking prac
tically unarmed, except for my body
guard of two hundred men," he added.
"That ought to be evidence to the whole
world that I do not favor any fighting
and of my pacific intentions."
He was evidently' exceedingly Rnxious
about the Ministers, for, returning to the
subject, he said.
"My heart is sore about them. I know
them all personally and am on the best
of terms with them."
News of Li Hung Chang's coming de

its special correspondent:
CANTON, Monday, via Hong
kong, July 17.-In reply to the British,
French. American and Portuguese Con
suls, who officially visited him in a body
this morning. Viceroy I^i Hung Chang in
sisted that his departure for the north,
which is fixed for Tuesday, has a two-fold
object â namely to save the lives of foreign
Ministers in Peking and to arrange the
best terms for peace possible with the
allied powers. He assured the Consuls
that he had taken all precautions against
any uprising. He added that he had re
ceived important cable messages from
Lord Salisbury and the French Foreign
Minister, M. Delcasse, identical in tcne
and demanding full protection* from in
jury and Insult of foreign Ministers in
Peking and threatening to take life for
life of high officials responsible if the
Ministers were murdered.
Li Hung Chang informed the Consuls
that he was the only Viceroy or high dig
nitary in all China who dared to transmit
such messages to the Empress and that
he had sent them verbatim. She received
them and he had no doubt whatever that
they have exerted powerful influence in
saving the Ministers' lives. As Doyen

ital of the province, but within its bor
ders are, locatrd Peking, the capital of the

is known not to desire service so far
north, as he maintains he has less influ
ence in that section of China than in his
present Vieeroyalty, the holdei'B of which
are at Canton. It is deemed probable,

that he. is the most influential Chinaman

THE WALLED CITY, TIENTSIN, CAPTURED BY THE ALLIES.
This picture was made from a drawing in Allyom's "Picturesque China," which was made about the time the first
Kuropean concessions were laid off (French and British). The city was some distance back from the river and inclosed
by a wall three miles in circuit and forty-five feet high, with about the same thickness at the base. This is what has
been breached, stormed and captured by the allied forces, according to the recent reports.
In the foreground of the picture the banks of the Peiho River arc seen in their natural state. Since the drawing
was made, however, the foreign concessions have been laid out and built up along the river, a tunnel constructed and
the whole aspect of the foreground changed. With the advent of the foreigners and the opening of the treaty
port, the population has more than trebled itself, and now the walled city contains but a. portion of the million or
mcire people living in Tientsin. The. added native town covers an area five times as great as that included in the old
Avails, and the whole aggregation on both sides of the river and of the Grand canal, which has its northern terminus
here, is surrounded by a mud wall thirty feet high, which until lately was kept in quite good repair. The railroad sta
tion and arsenal are on the north side of the river, from which the picture was made. \

WASHINGTON, July 17. -The ad
jutant general's office to-night
made public a detailed state
ment showing the provision
made by the War Department
in the equipment of the expeditionary
force Â«ent by the United States to China.
The strength of this force in. all the arms
of the service aggregates 10,665. It is pos
sible that this force may be further aug
mented to the extent of two or three
thousand men.
The Ninth Infantry, in addition to four
medical officers and twenty members of
the Hospital Corps, has with, it a full
regimental field hospital and an addition
al field outfit for fifty beds. The Four
teenth Infantry and Light Battery arc
provided with a Held hospital of twenty
five beds. In addition to this there has
been shipped already a general field hos
pital of 300 beds, medical supplies for 5000
men fcr three months and a hospital fund
of $50,000. The Grant,. sailing July 3 with
the Sixth Cavalry and the Sumner or.
July 16, carried eighteen medical officers
and seventy-eight hospital corps men.
w.hile Major Stevenson, one of the medical
officers, has been provided with a S50.00C
medical fund and $10,000 hospital fund.
The Meade_will sail on August 1 with not
less than eight medical officers and a field
hospital of fifty beds. The details for
the Hancock's sailing on August 16 are
not yet complete.
Food for the Fighters.
The Commissary Department has made
preparations to feed a force of marine?
and seamen engaged in shore service in
China. Fifty thousand dollars in gold for
use in China has been invoiced to the
chief commissary at Manila. Major II. J.
Gallagher has boen detailed to report to
General Chaffee as chief commissary of
the troops in China. Owing to the proba
ble scarcity of fresh supplies on shore
the department has had recourse again
to canned beef, but for the present cam
paign it has been put in the form of beef
stew, corned beef and corned bÂ«>ef hash
and sufficient vegetables have been canned
with it to obviate the difficulty experi
enced in Cuba, where the troops were
forced to eat boef from the cans without
further cooking.
Major George F. Scrlven has been or-
Â» dererl to report to General Chaffee as chief
officer of the signal command. Chief Siff
1 nal Officer Greely recommends that Cap
! tain Kdward B. Ives and Lieutenant
I Charles B. Rogan be relieved from duty
I in Cuba in order to report here, pending
I orders to China.
i Troops leaving the States for China will
carry a complete outfit of comfortabla
clothing, in addition to their regulation
clothing and tentage. Owing to the se
vere weather that may be expected in
I Northern China during the winter, the
| expedition will carry MOO Sibley stove?.
ST.0O overcoats. COno pairs of Arctic over
! shoes. 5000 blanket-lined canvas hooda and
'other extra heavy winter. clothing in pro

THE above picture, published in The Sketch from a recent photograph, shows
Elr Robert Hart at his desk in his of^ce at Peking. Sir Robert Hart was
born at Portadown. Armagh, Ireland, in 1S33. His genius for languages led
him to enter the British consular service, and at the age of 24 he obtained
a post !n the Chinese customs service. Four years later (1861) he was made
inspector general, which office he has held ever plnce, nearly forty years,
and whf-n he was appointed to that post there were only three treaty ports in Chi
na, while at the close of last year there were in his employ over 700 Europeans
and *>Â» Chinese in the land service, besides twenty armed customs cruisers, of
ficered by Europpans and manned by Chinese. He was a first-rate Chinese schol
ar, and r.o European ever possessed the authority among and commanded the re
spect of the Chinese, from the Dowager Empress down, that he did. His allowance
for the customs sor\-ice was some Â£4C>0.00r>. over the expenditure of which, as well
as the large staff of employes, he had absolute control.
Some time since he was made a mandarin of the highest rank and was deco
rated with a rod button, the double dragon and a peacock's feather. On account of
all these things many people are Inclined to believe that no matter what fate has
befallen the other Europeans in Peking. Sir Robert Hart has not been harmed.
UNCLE SAM wants transports, and
he wants them in a hurry. Offers
have been made to the owners of
the Australia, Zealandia, City of
Sydney, Colon, City of Para, Ohio, Sen
ator and City of Puebla, and the chances
are that all these vessels will be pressed
Into service as soon as they reach port.
The rush of troops to China has not yet
begun, but Inside of a fortnight the
United States can have 10,000 men on the
way to the Orient.
The Ohio is due here from Seattle and
the Australia from Honolulu. The Colon
will get here from Panama on the 20th.
while the City of Sydney and City of Para
will come here direct from Central Ameri
can ports, their places being taken by the
San Bias and San Juan, now laid up in
the stream.
The Senator and City of Puebla are now
in Puget Sound waters, and both can be
brought home Inside of a week. The
Zealandia is at Harrison-street wharf
ready for sea, and she will probably be
the rtrst of the new fleet to sail.
Every one of these vessels was a trans
port during the Spanish war. and every
one of them can be refitted almost at a
moment's notice. Should the situation
warrant all of them will be called upon,
and then there will be a general mix-up
in transport circles. The chances are that
the Oceanic Steamship Company will re
fuse to give up the Australia, as the
travel to Hawaii is very heavy at this
time of the year, but all the other vessels
can be secured, and Uncle Sam may take
the Australia, even though the owners
protest.
The transport Sumner and the chartered
steamer Californlan both got away for
the Orient yesterday afternoon. At least
two men who sailed on the Sumner are
under direct orders to join the forces
under Brigadier General Adna R. Chaffee
at Taku. These are Major "William

DENVER. Colo.. July 17.â Professor Van

for the present. His father, Dr. B. A.

him, sent from .Nagasaki, Japa*i, whera
he evidently went on leaving Tientsin.
As professor of civil engineering in the
Imperial University of China at Tientsin
Van Norman McGee was in the most pre
carious position when the Chinese Boxers
swept the Europeans and Americans from
the streets and drove them' to the foreign
concession. He barely escaped with his
life in one of Admiral Kempft's launches.
The party' was fired upon by the mob all
the way down the river to the foreigners'

latest news.
"Friday morning. 6 o'clock. â I don't al
ways get up quite as early as this, but
we heard that all the mission churches In
Tientsin (the Chinese city), two blocks
from here, were burned last night. They
had been closed ever since the trouble be
gan and were turned over to the Chinese
officials. The Chinese official seal had been
placed on the doors to show that they
were under Chinese protection. It points
to a bad state of things and proves how
powerless they are to protect anything. A
mob made one of the official servants of
the Viceroy get out of'his chair 'and walk
while the mob Jeered him because he had
been carrying messages to foreigners.
More than a week ago a guard went from
here to meet and aid some Belgian refu
gees trying to reach Tientsin. At several
villages they were given tea and things to
eat. The Boxers burned every one of the
villages and killed every man, woman and
child they found because they aided for
eigners.
Boxers Bullet Proof.
"All Chinese, from the highest to the
lowest, think the 'Boxer' a spirit 'that
can't be killed. If hit by a bullet they
Just cough and spit It out. One man, a
graduate of Yale, even believed it till the
soldiers killed some of them. That's the
reason It is so hard for the Chinese offi
cials to put them down. The soldiers will
not fight them. They do not have guns,
but use swords and pikes, and for a
mark of the order, wear a red sash and
turban, and a small cash box with a
paper charm Is worn around the neck.
During a fight, when they advance, they
run a few steps and fall down, Jump up
and run a few steps and fall. This they
repeat over and over to convey the Idea
that they have been shot, but can get up

go now, so I will close and send, as we
cannot be certain about getting mall out."
Mr. Drummond's letter, augmented by
a letter from a Mrs. ,Fearon, the wife of
an American merchant located there, tells
of the haste with which the foreign resi
dents left Tientsin for Shanghai on the
15th of June. Mrs. Fearon is a niece of
the late John F. Swift and a cousin of
Judge Campbell. With their family Mr.
and Mrs. Drummond left Tientsin on the
last armored train which succeeded in
leaving the city. Almost all their posses
sions were left behind, the same being the
case with the other foreigners. No time
was available for packing. Every mo
ment counted. A few things were thrown
together and they were off,. glad to leave
the scene of trouble behind them. The
safe arrival of Mr. and Mrs. Drummond
in Shanghai is chronicled at length. "While
nothing is said of Mr. and Mrs. Ragsdale

safe. The Ragsdales and Drummonds are

SAKTA ROSA. July 17.â Two letters

tne American Consul at Tientsin. The
other Is" from Mrs. Lucy Campbell Drum

brings the Joyful news that, with her fam

found safety in Shanghai.
Mrs. Ragsdale's letter Is under date of
June 14 and gl%-es a thrilling account of
the dangers which beset the American
colony at Tientsin at that time, as well
as the foreigners in general. The letter
was received by Mrs. Dr. Finlaw and is
as follows:
"With such an unsettled state of affairs
on every hand, work of any kind is out
of the question. It is war In earnest now.
By the time this reaches you I presume
this will all be settled, but how? "We are
so anxious for the people at Peking with
out giving ourselves a thoughtâ three hun
dred foreigners with a three hundred
guard of foreign troops against 100,000
Chinese soldiers as well armed and drilled
as the foreigners are. Before aid can
reach them they must pass these troops
and two walls fifty feet high and thirty
feet thick. The gates are ten feet wide
and well guarded. How is it to be done?
The Chinese have foreign guns mounted
on the walls and trained on the lega
tions. The fear is that when our troops
reach there and trouble begins at tlie
outside wall the Chinese will try to kill
every foreigner that is Inside.
Railroads Destroyed.
"The railroads have been badly dam
aged, bridees burned, etc. All this week
they have been trying to put them in shape,
and are only half way. The other forty
miles they will march, starting this even
ing, as the remainder of the road is so
badly damaged that it would take a long
time to fix it, and such anxious letters
come from Peking that they must press
on. If the railroad was finished the
troops could be rushed up. Not less than
10,000 should try to force an entrance, and
there are less than 3000 on the road. They
have eleven field guns, but the Chinese
have them also. There Is a fort just east
of Tientsin on the other bank of the
river. The fort' has three cannon trained
on the settlement. For three weeks we
have had a houseful. Admiral Kempff of

Lives in Jeopardy.
*'We have Just heard that it is only by
the most persistent, efforts on the part of
a few Chinese officials who are friendly to
foreigners that the lives of the foreigners
have been spared so long, and they fear
they cannot avert it much longer. Those
who know say there never has been such
a bad lot of men at the head of affairs.

British Inspector of Chinese Customs
Who Sent the Last Word
From Peking. s
ther stated that the negotiations did not
concern the future government of China.
In fact, he expressed confidence that as
a result of the action of Secretary Hay
in declaring a non-partisan policy, to
which the other Governments had assent
ed, the dismemberment of China would
not occur.
Officials of the administration are hope
ful that the Boxer Insurrection will not
extend to Korea. It was pointed out that
disturbances in Korea might lead to Rus
sia sending troops into the Hermit King
dom, and such action would undoubtedly
be objected to by Japan. Mr. Tam, who is
in charge of the Korean legation here,
expressed surprise when informed of the
operations of the Boxers near the Korean
border. There had never been any trouble
between the missionaries and the Ko
reans, but Chinese frequently crossed the
border and caused disturbances.
Wu Ting Fang, the Chinese Minister,
urged to-day that civilians accompany the
American troops for the purpose of assur
ing the Chinese of the friendly purpose of
thfe American Government. In Mr. V/u's
opinion such officials would be of great
value in learning the facts and ascertain
ing the purpose of the Chinese Govern
ment In placing the responsibility for the
existing trouble and in effecting a peace
ful settlement.
It Is understood that during the Cabinet
meeting to-day there was no action as to
the appointment of a successor to Minis
ter Conger, though an American repre
sentative probably will be sent to China,
and the name of Minister \\ . W. Rockhlll
continues to be mentioned in connection
with this post.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WEL
LINGTON" HOTEL, WASHING
TON', July 17.â While negotiations
are in progress between the powers
of Europe relative to the strength
of the forces the allies shall place In
China, the United States !s studiously re
fraining from participating in the discus
sion and continues to act independently.
An pffort has been made to draw the
United States Into these negotiations, and
this, perhr^js, accounts for the fact that
the State Department is well informed of
the diplomatic developments that occur.
But Secretary Hay does not propose to
take any action which may bind the
United States in the future. The United
States Â¦will send troops to China, and as
many of them as may be necessary,
Â¦without consulting the other powers.
These troops' will 'act solely for the pro
tection.of American interests, but If they
can accomplish such protection by acting
concurrently with the troops of the other
powers they will do so. At this time the
course Â«f action lies in such concurrence,
but there will be no diplomatic action
taken which will bind the American
troops to continue to operate with the
allies.
It was reported to-day that the nego
tiations between the powers related to the
desire of Great Britain and Japan to per
mit the latter to place a force in China
sufficient to establish peace and order
and maintain it. Russia, supported by
Germany, was said to be opposing this
policy. A high official of the State De
partment informed me that no such in
formation had been received. It was fur-

ELECTED FOR THE YEAR
and watched. Some were unconcerned
and some were not, but all were at a
high nervous tension and there was a
sigh of relief when the session adjourned
to this afternoon.
he was notified to remain within call. He
was not called again last night, but he
was notified to be present this after
noon at 2 o'clock, when the Jury will meet
again, and at that time he will be called
once more.' The question Involved Is one
that- would be a proper one In court, but
It Is claimed that the testimony before a
grand Jury being secret and not for the
purpose of use In the prosecution of a
case, does not come within the provision
giving a man the right to refuse to give
evidence that may Incriminate him.
Ruef Talks Freel
Ruef took another two hours and a half
before he had said all his Kay. lie went
over the case thoroughly, ttrst on his own
statement and then under cross-examina
tion. He made the point that the duty
of the Public Administrator extends only
to the care of an estate entrusted to him
and that he has no power to go outside
to secure evidence In regard to heirs; that
he must distribute the estate to whomever
the court declares Is the proper heir,
satisfying himself only that the man to
whom he delivered the property is the
heir..montloned in the decree of "distribu
tion.
He'dfdared that the Public Administra
tor had refused to deliver the estate of
Sullivan to th-.? heir designated by the
court, despite the decree of distribution,
despite the caveats of two notaries, despite
bonds and agreements and promises, de
spite a deposition that Ruef claimed he
had no right to take even though he did
take it, and despite the fact that the law
requires an Immediate distribution if the
heir wishes it. Instead, he declared, the
Administrator hr.d held the estate for six
ty days, not from the time of the Issuance
of the decree, but from the time It was
signed. Jive days later, and In those extra
five days he said, the expose had oc
curred. Ruef Â«lso denied the statements
made by Chretien In which he alleged that
there was an cgreement between them,
and also that he had in any way anything
to do with the machinations of Chretien
and his coconsplrators.
Others Who Will Be Questioned.
There were also present yesterday Bow
den of San Jose, who has Sullivan's pow
tr of attorney; Ganes, the Janitor of tfie
Chretien office, who will corroborate somo
of Colthorp's testimony: Colthorp, the
Mack John Sullivan, who Bigned Chre
tien's papers In the estate whenever the
name of John Sullivan was required: Lee
D. Craig, the notary, who attested tne
signature of John Sullivan without seeing
or knowing the signer; Judge Charles
Low, who. It was said, was sent to Chre
tien by Ruef to tell Chretien to keep qule*.
and say nothing: Nlles, who knows
lnitchy; Keane, Ruef's clerk, .who will
deny that he ever had such a conversa
tion on the cars with Chretien as appears
In Chretien's confession yesterday morn
ing: George Perry, Rauer's attorney, who
will add valuable evidence In the matter
of the payment of money to Rogers; Mr.
Brooks, Chretien's brother-in-law, to
whom Chretien gave a bundle of papers
just before his arrestâ the bundle of pa
pers Into which Detective Gibson looked
and fotind nothi"T connected with the
case; U. W. Day, to whom Rogers was
to have made an assignment of money
received from Rauer. and Gibson, the de
tective, who will tell the result of his
investigations. * .
All of these stood around and waited
IT WAS a small crowd that gathered
about the doors of the Grand Jury
room yesterday when the Chretien
steal came up for Investigation. All 'he
faces made familiar by the proceed
ings before Judge Troutt were there, and
a lew others new to the case. The ses
sion was a long and a tedious one, and
ended Just before 11 o'clock last night;
but In that time most of the principal
witnesses were examined and the hard
part of the case was gone through with.
There has been no decision as yet, but
when all the evidence has been secured
the Grand Jury will debate the testimony
and action will follow.
Witnesses Who Were Called.
Chretien, Rauer, Ruef. Rogers, Graef
and Howden w6re examined, and all but
Rogers testified. Rogers declined to say
a word about the case on the ground that
It might incriminate him.
Rogers was called Just after Graef and
Rauer, ar.d they followed Chretien. The
last named repeated his statement made
before Judge Troutt and since the pro
ceedings in court, reiterating the asser
tions involving Rogers, Ruef, Colthorp
and others, and going into details on each
phi.se of the case In answer to a thousand
questions put lo him by various jurors
and by the iMstrlct Attorney. He was be
fore the Jury nearly three hours, and
there was none of that time lost.
Rauer was put on after ChretleVi, and
at once speculation turned toward Rog
er*, for it Is the testimony of Rauer that
most directly Implicates the attorney.
Rauer brought an armful of books along
with him, and he was still explaining his
end of the matter when a recess was
taken until evening. After the recess he
went at It again, and for another hour
he and his books held the. stand. Then he
gave place to Graef, his son-in-law, who
backed his explanation of the entries In
his books.
Rogers Refuses to ,Testify.
Color to the theory that the jury was
working toward the case of Mr. Rogers
was given by the call of the bailiff sum
moning Rogers to attend. He picked up
a bundle of papers and disappeared behind
the doors ami every one waiting settled
himself (or another long wait. But In Jive
minutes the attorney came out again, and
for half an hour paced the hall in silent
communion with himself.
It was not known then that he had
braved the authority of the Grand Jury,
and the llrst thought was that the Jury
had secured all the evidence it wanted,
and had only asked him what was his true
name as a matter of form, but afterward
it was noised abroad that he had declined
to answer, hut repeating the play marie
before Judge Troutt had decided to "stand
upon his rights." lie was a^iked a few
questions and at once demanded to know
if his acts were under Investigation. He
was told that thoseÂ«of every one connected
with the case were under Investigation,
and then he declined to answer any ques
tions on the pround that he could not be
obliged to testify against himself.
Will Be Called Again To-Day.
There was a lull for quite a while after
Rogers was allowed to go. for the jury
wished to argue the proposition, and then

bosses will not miss a chance to shout
and bellow.
Republican citizens who have In mind
the welfare of the State and the principles
of good government should give their time
anu attention to the duty of electing
decent and Intelligent delegates to tho
nominating conventions. The duty of ai
lendinjj d. strict meetings to agfee on a
list ot delegate* to be voted tor should
not be overlooked. The sure way to win
out is to put up a straight anti-boss ticket
in each district. More than an antl-bosj
label will be required. The men nominated
should be known to their fellow citizens
in the district as men of character ami
Independence. Tickets bearing the names j
of trustworthy Republicans should be
p/aced In the field as early as possible.

publican voters in the various Assembly
distncts how the true anti-boss delegate
ticket can be verilied.

Propose to Take in
Pending Conflict.
The first mass-meeting of Chinese ever
he id in America will probably be called to
morrow by Consul General Ho Yow for
the purpose of enabling the Chinese of
San Francisco to clearly set forth to the
people of tho I'r.Sted States the position
which they int<-!;il to take in the pending
great conflict between Cblna and the
W-or!d at larpe.
It has l>cc:i reported to Ho Yow that
Ecomary Hay has grave fears for the
safety of tho i'liino^e here. H.> Yow lias

Hay'p framing was lir?t reported there
Â¦Wf-re many among them who supposed
that he had private Information throujrh
the Â«ecr<*t service of s^me movement
Mhich Tias not known to the public.
At the propn.sisl mass-meeting all the
leading Chinese of the city will be present,
BiA the f.rPt and most important act of
thn^e present will be to pass resolutions
expressing tholr grief and sympathy for
the churkinp brutnlllies inflicted by the
Tartar and Manchu Boxers upon the de
fenseless Americans who were penned
within the walls of the Chinese cities.
In addition ncasurifs will be taken to
roTider artlve assistance to the l T nltÂ«'d

The meeting will be held in the Nine !

Ho Yow says he has no information as !
to the condition of the foreigners in P*Â» I

1'ublle teleprams, but that in regard to i
the latter he is inr-iined to believe the of- I

I'ofts and Telegraphs, which denied the :
J'eklng massacre. There Is every reason, j
h* said, why this man should" tell the j
truth, ar.d he is. of all men In the world, I
the only one who has at his command the
tr:Â«^nnÂ» of ascertaining the whole truth.
Some of the older and more conserva

to the wisdom Of the policy of adopting
resolutions of fympathy. being afraid that

they were Incriminating themselves. The i
vKer and more progressive men. guided j
by the counsel of Ho Yow. have prevailed i

Minister Wu Tins; Fane: at \Va-=hinjjton
liis sent no further communications to I
Ho Yow which he can make public at the j
riresent time, but from the unusual aetiv
ty at the consulate It can be easily seen I
that important news of some sort has
been received.
From I member of the consulate it waÂ«
learned that the former Chinese Consul

Special Dispatch to The- Call.
â¢ VALLEJO, July 17.â The fourth Solano
â¢ County Agricultural Society race meet
r opened to-day under very favorable cir
cumstances. The pavilion at the track
was comfortably filled, a large crowd
" thronged the betting inclosure, while
three score 'of teams with rural visitors
â¢ lined up In the Infleld. The Marine Band
from Mare Island discoursed popular airs.
, proving a moat enjoyable feature of the
afternoon's sport.
In the stand Thomas Smith acted as
J starting Judge with F. W. Kelley of the
Breeder and Sportsman and Frank Drake
â¢ of Vallejo as associates. The class
pace, the stellar attraction, resulted In a
long drawn out contest, linally resulting
in a victory for the favorite. Key Direct,
poorly driven by F. Parker. It was nearly
a o'clock before the crowd left for town.
Had Parker scored up In the earlier heata
the long end of the purse would have
been his long before dusk. A strong wind
swept over the course, which, added to
the lumpy condition of the track, pre
cluded any fast time.
Puerto Rico took the 2:19 special trot,
a fantastic affair. In straight heats. The
only running event on the card fell to
Tenrica, a 20 to 1 shot, well ridden by
Doc Bragg, the temperance advocate.
It was not until 2:30 o'clock that the
starters in the 2:30 pace were called. Pools
sold Rey Direct 10, Margaretta. owned by
Jo Terry and raced at N'apa under the
name of Marguerite, 5, the field 3.
To the surprise of all. Doc Wilkes. a 13
to 1 chance, went out and was never
caught, reaching the wire over a length
before Santa Anita Maid and the favorite.
The heat following was a very ragged
one, nearly all of the starters at different
times finding egg shells to step on. Doc
Wilkes again led to the stretch, when he
went In the air. Maben behind Santa
Anita Maid then assumed the front posi
tion, and at 8 to 1 downed Doe Wilkes and
Irvlngton Boy cleverly. With Rey Direct
still ruling favorite Margaretta annexed
the heat following from the first choice
and Santa Anita Maid. The fourth heat
fell to the favorite. Parker finally awak
ening from his reverie. Then came the
celebrated fifth chapter, causing a very
vexing question. At the first turn Irving
ton Hoy fell in a hoap, also being the
cause#( Doc Wilkes' bike wearing a grog
gy lofik. In a hard drive I>afferty, by
splendid driving, landed Margaretta win
ner over Rey Direct.
The judges ruled that Irvlngton Boy was
! entitled to start again, but declared Doc
Wilkes distanced, a decision certainly open
to criticism.
With the rest earned through the acci
dent Irvington Koy pulled down the next
heat. Rey Direct finishing second: Maben
and Lafferty both nursed the balls along
ti.e rail for a postponement, to no avail.
Before the sun kissed itself from sight
sturdy little Rey Direct went out and
took the two necessary heats to win first
money.
Candlelight ruled favorite for the six
furlons dash, but a poor start contributed
to his defeat. Tenrica drew clear of the
bunch at the paddock, beating Whitcomb
and Romany hands down. It was an eagle
bird for Humphrey & Co.. which firm,
with two books on, laid very liberal quota
tions. Summary:

CROWD DRANK WINE
ON "TOM" FERGUSON
THOMAS M. FERGUSON, who knows the prftof of red liquor by glancinc at
it with one eye, and Dan Carter, who tan tell a two-bit cigar from the bit
article by the color of the smoke.. raced on the speedtrack in the park yester
day afternoon. Carter now sports a silver medal crowded with inscriptions,
and Ferguson wears mourning on his person and funerral expression on his face.
Carter won; Ferguson lost. The crowd lined up against the park resort bars,
drank something that had bubbles in it find Ferguson paid for it all, the medal
which he will not wear and the wine, most of which the others drank.
For pome time Carter and Ferguson fought respiratory battles over the speed
possibilities of their horses. "The Moose" 1* the property of Carter and "Dave".
that of Ferguson. Both are trotters of a good class. The difference of opinion
made the race. A medal was struck off and an inscription engraved upon it'aa
long as one of Pheian's messages. Monday afternoon several cases of champagne
were put in iho coolers at a resort just outsldt the park.
The conditions were that each driver should have a man with him. Ferguson
imported a lightweight from New Orleans. Sol Lobe. Carter selected HIppolyte
Bier for his name's cake. George A; Knight and~Charles Bier were the Judges.
They might as well have stayed at home. No Judges, were needed.
"Oh. I'll win Jn a walk!" yelled Ferguson when the race was started. "Smoke
up, you're out!" cried Carter. And then they Went to it. From the stables down
the speedtrack they tore, turned and came down the other side. Carter led at the
start, kept well ahead on the turn, when, foot by foot. "Dave" crept up until both
horses were abreast. Then something happened to Ferguson. His horse broke and
"The Moose" finished too many lengths in advance to count or hold in the wind.
The crowd In waiting drove over for liquid accompaniment, to congratulate and
to offer consolations. Of course. Ferguson bought "copious beakers." but he dung
to the end of the counter Faying not a mirthful word. Muttering to himself, he
gave a clouded utterance, that filtrated through the vapors of wine:
"If I only had buttons on my ribbons I could have hold that -horse. The reins
kept a-sllpptns and a-slipping Just as I was passing Carter, and then the horse
broke. Say. give us a couple quarts more."
Carter will not accept the challenge for a return race. Ke says he will rest for
all time on his championship laurels.

ADVERTISEMENTS.
I Dr. McLauglilin's Electric Belt
â¢
"If you cure me I will pajr yoa. If not. I
won't."
That is a fair proposition. It is a severe
teat of the value of a curative remedy. Pay
only when cured! Who dares accept such an
offer unless he Is positively certain of his
power to cure? Who dares accept It anyway?
Tou not only have to be sure of the remedy,
but you must trust to the honesty of the pa-
tient. As the old sayln* iroes. "When the
devil was sick the devil a saint would be, but
when the devil was well the devil a saint vai
j he." Some men are not half as grateful ,, to
I the man who cured them as they thought they
i would be before he did It.
, I Will Take Chances.
But I will take my chances with nine men
out of ten. I have the remedy. I have proven
1 Its curative power, and thousands of people
: In this State are pratatng It. Now that I know
that my Electric Belt is a positive cure for
every ailment for which I recommend !t. I am
willing to send it-to any honest man wttl)
instructions for using it, and after he has
used It three months if It has cured him hs
can pay me; If not. then he can return it
to me and he owes me nothing.
What It Cures.
Rheumatism, Lame Back. Nervous Debility.
Physical Decline, Varlcocele and all the evi-
dences of a wasting nervous energy; Locomo-
tor Ataxia, Paralysis, Kidney, Stomach and
Liver Troubles. Constipation and every indica-
tion of 111 health. It cures because it restores
strength, and where there is strength there
Is no chance for disease.-
\ No Cure â No Pay.
Take my Electric Belt for what !t will do for
you. Give it a fair trial and when you are
well you can pay me for It. Wear it white
you sleep at night or while you are resting
after your work. You win find it a vitalizer,
a tonic to your nerves, a rejuvenator of wan-
ing vitality. t*se it for any ailment which
drugs have failed to cure and you will never
cease praising It.
It Does Not Burn.
Remember that I make the only electric belt
In the world that does Us curing without sear-
ing or burning the flesh. It has a powerful
current, but I have arranged special cushion
electrodes and a perfect regulator so that the
patient has full control over the current at
all times. If you have been humbugged by
a burning belt, or by one that gives no cur-
rent at all. I will allow you half the cost ol
mine for it.

Such men have we in the Republican party,
and fuch are the men whose names are pre

synonymous with honesty, ability, loyalty,
courage and qualities that make men great;
whose ability in the highest council chambers
of the land has been amply proved; whose
courageous loyalty bade them throw aside the
pursuits and pleasures of busy happy existence
and hasten to the battlefield at their country's

emancipation of the millions of slaves in our
own country; thÂ» other to a war resulting In
the emancipation of 'A0"0,000 of Imperialistic

Roosevelt's Speech.
To-night Governor Roosevelt addressed
a most enthusiastic crowd in the Audito
rium. Thousands besieged the tioors of
the hall two hours before they were
opened. At 7 o'clock the crowds were
finally given a chance to get inside and
every inch of space was hiled in a few
minutes. Thousands of persons surged
about the streets, unable to gain entrance.
When the party entered the hall the
Governor was given a great ovation. The
Twin City Campaign Glee Club, an octet
of well known singVrs. furnisher! a couple
of selections, and then Colonel Stone lor
mally called the meeting to order and in
troduced United States Senator Cushman
K. Davis as chairman of the evening.
As Senator Davis named the speaker of
the evening the crowd came to its feet
and for six minutes cheers and applause
swept the hall. When Roosevelt finally
was able to make himself heard he re
turned thanks for the reception that had
been tendered him here to-day. He
thanked the Roosevelt Club especially for
its choice of a name and uniform. HÂ«
said he was pleased at the honor, for It
was a club of young men, and young men
stood for much. The Governor then spoke
for decency and efficiency in public life,
for courage in carrying out what one be
lieves. He had no use. he said, for timid
persons. Public officials should be honest,
brave :md have the saving grace of com
mon sense. Tho=e were ne-e-ded in public
just as much as in private life.

WASHINGTON'. July 17.â The movement
undertaken in Philadelphia in' opposition
to the colonial policy of the Government,
and subsequently organized In Chicapo, is
about to be revived under the auspices of
men of influence in both parties who are
hostile to the candidates put up at Phila
delphia and Kansas City and their plat
forms.
Former Senator Edmunds, who is now a
resident of Philadelphia and who was
active in the anti-imperialism efforts re
ferred to, has been approached as to his
probable position in event of an independ
ent movement, but it is not certain that
he will pive it Ills support. Emissaries of
the disgruntled elements of both parties
have been quite active since the adjourn
ment of the nominating conventions, and
ciaim to be meeting with success in their
efforts to bring together a sufficient num
ber of representative leaders of former
political affiliations to inaugurate a move
ment which will appeal to the conserva
tive element.
Former Senator Her.derscn, who resides
in Washington, has been in correspond
ence and consultation with several gen
tlemen on the Fubject. and he is hopeful
of securing an cipanizntion within the im
mediate future which will result in a tick
et being put in the field. An effort is to
be made to induce former President Cleve
land to head the movement by an appeal
to the people and to have this followed by
indorsements trom both Democratic and
Republican sources. The main reliance of
the promoters of the independent ticket is
thÂ° strong Democratic element Ut New
York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania 'Snd the
New England States which will not go to
Bryan on account of silver and is not pre
pared to support the Republican ticket on
account of Imperialism, so called. A simi

and other parts of the West.

J. W. YERKES NOMINATED
FOR GOVERNOR OF KENTUCKY
DE VRIES TO RESIGN
HIS SEAT IN CONGRESS
LOUISVILLE, Ky., July 17.â The Re
publican State Convention to-day nomi
nated for Governor Hon. J. W. Yerkes, a
prominent attorney of Danville, and at
present a collector of internal revenue,
adopted a platform declaring the issue
of the election to be the Goebel election
law and adjourned within three hours.
There was no nomination to be made
by the convention except for Governor,
this year's election in Kentucky befng
an extraordinary one to till the vacancy
in the Governoiship made by the death
of William Goebel. The present Gover
nor, Beckham, will hold this office only
till his successor is elected, when he will
again become Lieutenant Governor.
The platform adopted contained three
planks, the second and third respectively
indorsing the Philadelphia convention and
its nominees and urging the Government
to protect Americans in China, and the
first dealing with the State campaign.
This is a bitter denunciation of the pres
ent Democratic administration and the
Democratic majority in the Legislature
and urges the repeal of the Goebel elec
tion law.

Candidacy*
ST. PAT-L. Minn.. July 17. -The State
Ivoaeucs of Republican Clubs and
members thereof, singly and in
pquads. have been arriving In this
city for two or three days and the
morning trains to-day brought in a large
number. The chief event of the morning
was the arrival o? Governor Roosevelt.
The distinguished truest was met at the
depot by the St. Paul Roosevelt Republi
can Rough Riders' Club, a citizens' com
mittee, the Minnesota State band and
many citizens at large, who cheered
lustily.
As Governor Roosevelt alighted from
his carriage at the Hotel Ryan, the Rough
Iiiders who had escorted him from the
station pave him a few hearty cheers
which seemed to arouse a responsive feel-
Ing in the breast of the Governor, for he
went down the line and shook hands with
the mcnibeis. He said he was glad to
pee the young men of the country so act
ive, as it meant much for the future good
of the campaign.
The National League of Republican
Clubs was called to order by President
Stone at 10:25 o'clock in the Auditorium.
Secretary D. H. Stine read the call as
sembling the League in its twelfth ses
sion, which was followed by the roll call
of States. About half the number re
sponded. Acting Mayor Oregg made a
snort adGress ox welcome.
Governor Roosevelt was then intro
duced, lie said:
"As I am to nave the honor of address-
Ing you to-night all 1 shall say this morn
ing is that I am glad to see you here and
thank you for having come, and 1 wish
you all success in all your efforts in the
o>ming campaign. When I wish success
to you. I wish success to every principle
that makes American citizenship worth
having."
1'nited States Senator Nelson of Min

the it-sues of the opening campaign.

LOS ANGELES BILLBOARDS
A LOS ANGELES ordinance limiting the height
of advertising fences to six feet has been
â¢ clared valid by the courts. The reports of the
case state that the decision of the Judge "covers every
isfue involved in the dispute between the billposters
snd the authorities of various cities who have sought
-to check the skyward flight of the billboards. After
referring to section 11 of article XI of the State con
stitution, which give? county, city, town and township
government control of police and sanitary rejjulntions.
the court goes on to ftate (hat this-powcr is confirmed
by the charter of the city."
The decision is one more victory for a reform
movement now under way in every part of the Union,
and. indeed, over a considerable portion of Europe as
well, for we have had occasion to recently note the
steps that have been taken in France and in Great
Britain to abate the nuisance of billboajd advertising,
not only in large cities, but at all stations along rail
wav lines.
It is not creditable to San Francisco that Los An
g{J e * should have been permitted to lead in this im
portant reform. We have been forced to content our
selves with the passage of an ordinance limiting the
height of advertising fences to ten feet, and to he
rnforc<*d a year hence. I-os Angeles restricts such
fences to fix feet and the order is in effect now.
Congratulations arc due to the thriving metropolis
of the south. By *he removal from her streets of the
towering, lurid and dangerous advertising fences,
which have become &oÂ» common in American cities,
her attractiveness to persons of artistic taste will be
much increased. Ir>. the end similar ordinances will
be enforced everywhere. Los Angeles has the satis
faction of leading rhr way, and now that the validity
of her ordinance has been sustained it will not be long
befor* other cities will follow the example.

There is going to be another revolution
in the "Black Stack" tugboat service. At
the outbreak of the Spanish war Uncle
Sam took possession of the Fearless, Act
ive and Vigilant. The Fearless, renamed
the Iroquois, is now used as a cruiser
among the Hawaiian Islands, the Vigilant
runs between the naval station at Goat
Island and San Francisco, while the Active
is at Mare Island.
The loss; of *hese three vessels necessi
tated the building of another tug by the
company. ,The work was intrusted to the
Union Iron Woiks, and the new Fearless
was the result.
The. new Fearless has n6Â°w been ordered
to Honolulu by the Spreckels Tugboat
Company, and will be seen in company
with her namesake off Diamond Head In
the near future. She will leave here in
command of Captain Gilbert Brokaw. who
will remain in charge, while she is at the
Islands. Captain ' Harry Marshall, who Is
now in command of the Fearless, will
take charge of the Reliance until the new
steamer arrives from the East.

FROM
SEA
AND
SHORE
0 DISTFflBUTION OF WOMEN.
\.\ ANY are the movements for establishing
/ \ closer relations between Great Britain and her
* colonies that have been started in London
since the outburst of the imperial spirit caused by the
war in South Africa, but about the most interesting
cf them all is one for promoting an emigration of
women from the mother country to Canada, Australia
and South Africa.
Throughout the colonies there is a notable majority
of men over women, while in Great Britain, and es
pecially in London, there are far more women than
men. Reformers who have plenty of time to take
thought about the welfare of the world regard the
existing condition of things in that respect' as preju
dicial to the old country and to the colonies, to men
and to women. They have therefore started a move
ment to bring about .what they call "sex equilibrium,"
and are urging it forward with a good deal of en
thusiasm and faith.
The British Government has tried in various ways
to induce an emigration of women to the colonies,
but has failed. The girls prefer to be unmarried in
London rather than married in Australia, South
Africa or even British Columbia. It is said there are
upward of 500.000 marriageable girls in London who
should go out and colonize, but who refuse to go.
Thus there exists within the empire the defect of hav
ing too many men at the extremities and too many
women at the capital.
After profoundly considering the problem the re
formers have come to the conclusion that the reason
the girls are not willing to accept governmental as
sistance and go to the colonies is because they have
not been properly introduced to the young men who
live out there. The British maiden has respect for
the conventionalities of society, and will not go
io.ooo miles to marry a man Jo. whom she has not
been introduced. Acting upon that belief the re
formers propose a new plan for governmental action.
Instead of offering inducements for the girls to emi
grate, they propose that the Government offer some
thing like a bounty for young men in the colonies to
go to London and meet the girls there.
The scheme is unquestionably correct from a so
cial point of view. Mrs. Grundy can surely be
counted on to give it her warmest approval. It is cer
tainly much more proper for the man to seek the girl
than for the girl to seek the man. and an'introduc
tion should of course precede a marriage. Should
the bounty offered by the Government for young
colonial wife-seekers io visit London be larc^e
enough to pay first class fare both ways the travel will
be considerable. The experiment will be watched in
this country with no little interest, for should it prove
successful perhaps Uncle Sam will offer a bounty for
young men of the West to go East and get introduced
to the surplus women of Massachusetts.
PRODUCE EXCHANGE
ELECTED OFFICERS
Also Raised Money by Subscriptions
for Support of Kindergarten
Bearing Its Name.
The annual election of the San Fran
cisco Produce Exchange, which took place
yesterdayr resulted In a victory for the
regular ticket. G. "W. ilcNear wus elected
president for the second time; H. Sher
wood, vice president: H. F. Allen, treas
urer; E. Gauthler Jr., E. "W. Ferguson.
E. E. Kahn, Max I. Koshland. E. A.
Bre3se and J. E. de Ruyter. director. A
committee on appeals was also elected,
consisting of Maurice Casey. J. J. Moore.
Henry Sinsheimer, H. A. Mayhew and J.
M. Pettlgrew.
Four of those elected, namely. Henry
F. Allen. John E. de Ruyter, E. Gauthier
Jr. and Max I. Koahland, were on both
tne regular and the opposition ticket. The
opposition was headed by Harvey C. Som
ers. The contest was not very sharp, only
about 85 votes being cast, out of a pos
sible 200. McNear for president received
57 votes against 2S for Somers. The offi
cers will be Installed and appointive offi
cers will be named by the board of direc
tors to-day, when the old board of orti
cers will report . the transactions of tha
year last past.
For the maintenance of the Produce Ex
change Kindergarten, which has been re
moved from 1233 Pacific street to Eigh
teenth and Hartford streets, subscriptions
were received by a committee to ' tha
amount of about $700. This will probably
be increased to $S00. E. B. Cutter, John
Wightman and E. R. LJl!e.nthal ara the
committee on subscriptions.
Commissioners Alone Have Power to
Specify What Improvements
Shall Be Made.
The City Attorney filed an opinion yes.
terday In which he holds that the Board
of Supervisors has no power either to
subdivide the park fund or to direct how
any portion thereof shall be used. The
City Attorney quotes the charter In sub
stantiation of his opinion, which is prac
tically the same as outlined in an article
on trie subject published in The Call of
July 8. The opinion, which is given on
a resolution regarding- the setting aside
in the "budget" the sum of $5000 lor Im
proving the Hospital Lot Park, says in
conclusion: .
The I'ark Commissioners have exclusive man
agement of the parks. It is for them alone to
say what Improvements shall be made and
iiow the general atfairs of the municipal park
Fyste-m shall be conducted. It would be alto
gether without reason, therefore, to hold that
the Board of Supervisors should appropriate
money for a specific purpose which it had no
power to effect.
The charter places a limit below which the
tax levy for park purposes cannot be fixed,
viz â¢ five cents upon each one hundred dollars
of taxable property In the city and county. The
Hoard /of {Supervisors is required to levy at
loaÂ«t this tax. This provision was Inserted in
the charter doubtless by way of precaution
against possible indifference of the Supervisors
to the Interests of the parks or because of a
fear of possible conflict between such board
and the Park Commission. The purpose was
to make the Park Commission an independent
branch of the municipal government. If the
Hoard of Supervisors had the power to dlv.de
the park fund and compel its use as It might
see fit, there would be no value in such provis
ion and the character of the commission would
be converted from one having discretion and
control into one purely administrative.
SUPERVISORS HAVE NO
CONTROL OF PARK FUND
AN INDEPENDENT COMMISSION.
. . ,
Â¦ f AVING been calied upon by a resolution ot ths
| 1 board to give an opinion whether the Super
* * visors have power to designate any specific im
provement to be made out of the park fund when
compiling the budget, and whether the Park Comrnis-^
sioners would be required to use the amount set aside
lor the purpose designated and no other, City Attor
ney Lane has clearly and emphatically upheld the in
dependence of the commission. His view is in ac
cord with that taken by the Park Commissioners
themselves and by the Auditor, and will doubtless be
accepted as a final. settlement of the question.
After quoting the various sections of charter in
volved in the issue, the City Attorney says: "All of
these provisions and others which need not be cited
go to show how full is the trust reposed in the Park
Commissioners. They have the "exclusive manage
ment and disbursement oi all funds.' It is not within
the power of the Board of Supervisors to say how any
portion of the park fund shall be used. There is no
limitation throughout the charter upon this plenary
grant of power. If it were possible for the Board oÂ£
Supervisors to say how any part of the fund must be
used, it would be po?-ible for it to subdivide the entire
fund and thereby control to the utmost the managerial
policy of the commission â a conclusion obnoxious to
the letter and the spvit of the charter."
It is further pointed out that the Park Commission
ers have exclusive management of the parks, and it is
for them alone to -determine what improvements shall
be made and how the general affairs of the municipal
park system shall be conducted. The charter places
a limit below which the tax levy for park purposes
shall not be fixed, and. as the City Attorney says:
"This provision was inserted in the charter doubtless
by way of precaution against the possible indifference
of the Supervisors *o the interests of the parks, or be
cause of a fear of possible conflict between such board
and the Park Commission. The purpose was to make
the Park Commission an independent branch of the
municipal government. If the Board of Supervisors
had the power to divide the park fund and compel its
a;se as it might see fit. there would be no value in
ruch a provision, and the character of the commission
â¢>would be converted from one having discretion and
control into one purely administrative."
By this opinion a conclusion has probably been
put to Mayor Phclan's efforts to dictate to the Park
Commission and malÂ»e that body subordinate to his
rÂ»-m. His scheme of converting the park lodge into
a branch library was a foolish one in itself, for peo^
T>le go to the parks for out-of-door recreation and
tot to sit in a hou?e and read. It has served, however,
<a good purpose in bringing this issue to a prompt
test, and demonetratinp the wisdom of the charter
inakers in establishing the Park Commission as an
> *ndependent^)ranch of the municipal government in
fco way subordinate to the politicians of the City Hall.

Not for some time have the officers at
the Presidio had such a busy day as yes
terday. Those of the artillery branch of
the service were particularly affected, as
orders were received early in the day to
"make ready for foreign service as soon
as possible."
Under the circumstances existing: at
present, foreign service means China and
a chance to avepge the deaths of their
comrades who were massacred by the
Boxers.- The troops now at the Presidio
will probably leave for the Qrient about
August 1, and the transports Meade and
Hancock will be used for their transpor
tation. Batteries I. O and A of the Third
Artillery, stationed at Aleatraz and the
Presidio, and Battery D of San Diego are
the envied ones.
There are now en route from the East
the followinp troops, whose probable des
tination is China, news of their starting
being made public to-day: Company R of
the "Battalion of Engineers from West
Point, four companies of the Third Bat.
talion of the Fifteenth Infantry, one com
pany from Atlanta. Ga., and three com
panies from Governor? Island, New lork.
They will leave here about August 1.
Their probable destination is China.
The horses of the Third Cavalry will be
shipped on the Aztec August 5 and those
of the Ninth Cavalry will leave here on
the Strathgyle August 7. The horses of
the First Cavalry will be shipped from
Seattle on the Athenian, which is booked
tn leave the latter part of this month.
The troopers are expected to arrive here
in time to take passage for China about
the same time.

WITH so many vast movements and disturb
ances going on in Asia to hold the attention of
the world, there is little opportunity given to
note the appearance there of minor events even when
they are portentous of evil to come. A new compli
cation which has just arisen on the Afghan border
is, however, sufficiently important to merit at least a
passing study even in these troublous times of Rus
sian aggression, Indian famine and Chinese insurrec
tion.
For a long time past the British Government has
had tinder consideration the construction of a railway
fiom Pcshawur to Khyber Pass. The distance to be
covered by the road is only twelve miles, but that nar
row space is in the territory of the Afridis, and to
cross it is something like crossing the Rubicon â a
thing easy enough in itself, but certain to entail far
reaching consequences.
"The line is desired by the British because it will
connect the whole railway system of India with the
gateway into Afghanistan, and enable the transporta
tion of troops in large numbers to the danger point
at any moment they might be needed. After hesi
tating over the project for years the Indian Govern
ment has recently decided to act, and a dis
patch from India announces that it is now definitely
settled that the road will be completed within three
month?.
The same dispatch states: "One of the more im
mediate results of the r.ew railway has been to plunge
th'e Afridis into almost open revolt. The greater part
of the new line runs through Afridi country, and no
subsidy can entirely recompense the Afridi for the
utilization of his country for the purpose."
A little scrimmage, with the Afridis would not b;
much in the way of- a war in these times, nor will it
impose any great task upon the Indian Government
tc provide a force sufficient to guard a twelve-mile line
of railway through the Afridi territory, but the hos
tility of that small tribe of mountaineers is not the
only element of danger in the problem. There is the
Ameer of Afghanistan to be considered. What view
will he take of a road that brings the British in force
to the very gate of his country?
The London Chronicle takes a cheerful view of th.2
situation. It concedes, indeed, that if the road were
extended twenty-four miles farther, so as to have
its terminus beyond Khyber Pass, it might be a sub
ject of trouble, but it does not look for anything like
war as the matter stands. Reviewing the whole sub
ject the Chronicle says: "As it is, the railway forms a
pendant to that already existing at Quctta, and brings
our advanced base on the Khyber line to practically
the same distance from Kabul as New Chaman is from
Kandahar. With the aid of these two railways we
could pour an army into either Northern or Southern
Afghanistan. without having recourse to the Karram
line, which was utilized on the last occasion by Lord
Roberts. The Ameer will naturally view the move
ment with some distrust; but the project has been so
long in hand that he has no ground for complaint, in
view of the fact that the present terminus of the line
will be twenty-four miles within our own border."
That is the British view of it. In the meantime the
Afridis are on the warpath, the Viceroy of India ii
getting ready to open the line with great ceremony,
and the Ameer of Afghanistan is studying the situa
tion and trying to make up his mind what he will do
when the issue is up to him.
A LITTLE SIDE TROUBLE.
Final Accounting Leaves Balance of
More Than Â§25,000 That Will

Citizens' Relief Committee
Makes Good Showing
and Retires.:
SURPLUS NOW TO
BE RECEIVED BY
THE MERCHANTS
BRY0N ON GOLD.
IN 1S93 the Democratic convention of Nebraska in
dorsed President Cleveland in demanding repeal ot
the purchasing clause of the Sherman act. There
upon Mr. Bryan, who was a member of the conven
tion, made a partihg-cf-the-ways speech, in which he
said:
"Gentlemen, I know not what others may do, but
duty to country is above duty to party. If the D.emo
cratic party, after you go home, indorses your action
and makes your position its permanent policy, 1
promise you that I will go out and serve my country
and my God under some other name, even if I must
go alone."
Well, the Nebraska Democracy did indorse that ac
tion and Mr. Bryan bolted, formed a mongrel fusion
with the Populists, and started out on the crooked
political path he has followed since. In 1896 that
straight Democracy of Nebraska held its convention
under the call of the National Committee, made its
delegation regularly and commissioned it to the Cho
cago convention. Mr. Tobias Castor was' the Ne
braska member of the National Committee and had
i.ot followed Mr. Bryan in bolting. Mr. Bryan ap
peared in Chicago at the head of a delegation of Pop
ulists, greeenbackers and political rag. tag and bob
tails, and Tillman, Jones & Company voted the regu
lar and straight delegation out and Bryan and his
mongrels in.
The young man changed his mind about "going
cut alone" and preferring country to party. When
the regular Democrats determined to stand by their
country, its credit and its integrity, rather than go
I'opulizing after ofiice with Mr. Bryan, he said in his
speech in Richmond, Va.: "I want to warn you who
are contemplating deserting from the Democratic
party at this time that the man who in the face of
such an enemy either goes to the rear or is found in
secret conference with the enemy is a traitor upon
whom the brand shall be placed and he shall not
come back."
That is a very fair index to Mr. Bryan's character.
When he bolted a party action that was in line with
the party policy and history he was serving God and
his country! When other men refused to desert their
party principles and history they were traitors, for
bidden by this upstart dictator to "come back!"
In 1896 his speeches were cast in the fashion of
anarchy. He used the language of the destroyer and
sought by every means. to rouse in his hearers the
spirit of violence and destruction. On August 25 he
said at Albany. X. V. : "We have then to consider
this question: Ought the American people to sub
mit longer to a gold standard? The Democratic party
has begun a war of extermination against the gold
standard. We ask no quarter. We give no quarter.
We shall prosecute our warfare until there is not a
single American citizen that dares to advocate a gold
standard policy. You ask why? We reply that the
gold standard is a conspiracy against the human race,
rnd that we should no more join it than we would an
rimy to destroy our homes and to destroy our fami
lies."
Fine talk for an aspirant to the Presidency, but well
calculated to cultivate in his partisans that spirit of
violent intolerance expressed in his Richmond speech.
At Syracuse, N. Y., August 24, he said: . "My
friends, the conspiracy we have to meet is a conspiracy
which has for its object the striking down of silver.
And that can only mean a gradual and continual in
crease in the purchasing power of the dollar, and that
means an indefinite season during which the holders
of fixed investments gather more than they loan and
during which those whe owe debts will pay more than
they agree to pay â an indefinite season during which
it will be more profitable to hoard money or loan it
than to invest it in enterprises or property."
That may be taken as a fair exposure of his knowl
edge of economics. What profit does hoarded money
pay? Money earns only when in use, not when it is
dormant. Again, if the dollar buys more property,
by increase in its purchasing power, why should those
who have it hoard or loan it in preference to buying
property? And. still again, what hinders those who
borrow it from buying property and so taking-ad
vantage of its increasing purchasing power? As a
rrfatter of fact, since the gold standard was established
by the vote of 1896 the purchasing power of the dol
lar has steadily decreased instead of increasing, as this
Mahdi of the Platte said it would. In 1896 sheep in
Nebraska were $1 81 per head; now they are $2 86.
Wool was 6 cents n pound; now it is 14. Wheat
was 50 cents a bushel; now it is 80 cents. Corn was
16 cents a bushel; now it is 44 cents. Oats were U
cents a bushel: now they are 24. Hogs were
$z 85 per cwt.; now they are $5 25. Steers were $.?
per cwt.; now they are $5 75. Horses arc worth 60
per cent more, and so runs the decrease in the pur
chasing power of a dollar through the whole list of
American productions. His foresight was vain. His
prophecy was foolish. Not a line nor letter of it has
come true. Then what are we to think of the political
judgment, the public spirit and the patriotism of thosft
men who insist on presenting him again as a can
didate, in whom there is the sum of all wisdom?
At Erie, Pa., on August 24, he said: "Do not let
the Republicans beguile you about the future. The
future is written in blood, crushed out of you by
What was then that future is now the past and
the present. Out of whom has gold crushed blood?
September 1 he said at Columbus, Ohio: "I call
your attention to the fact that no party in the history
of this country has ever in a national convention
commended the gold standard. Its effects are so bad
that no party has ever dared to uphold it. The ad
vocates of the gold standard have never dared to sub
mit the arbitration of the Rold standard to the ballot.
Every step that' has been, taken has been taken by
stealth and without the approval of the American
people."
In his Populistic oration to the convention which
nominated him he said, in paraphrase of Patrick
Henry: "We are fighting in defense of our homes.
our families and our posterity. We have petitioned,
and our petitions have been scorned. We hav*. en
tieat'd. and our entreaties have been disregarded.
We h.ye begged, and they have mocked, and our
calamity came. We beg no longer. We entreat no
more. We defy them."
Now who are "they" and "them" pointed to in all
this vaporing? f '.?-.;;
Looked at in the perspective of 1896, Colonel Bryan
remains now the sanw size he was then, and we feel
sure that ;f the Gold Democrats are ready to admit
that they were wron;? and "traitors," they still would
prefer that fomc other than he should be the bene
ficiary of their abasement.
PRESS COMMENT
ON
PROBATE FRAUDS
(SACRAMENTO BEE.)
The Call, followed by other pa
pers has had the good fortune to
expose one of the worst frauds ever
perpetrated In probate .proceedings
at San Francisco, and the confes
sion of Attorney Chretien completes
the story of a shameful piece of
robbery. So great a volume of pro
bate business Is done In that city
that the two Superior Court Judges
having charge of it are scarcely
able to give It proper attention. The
wonder is that such frauds are not
more frequently committed. In con
nection with this Sullivan case
Judge Troutt has had the good
sense to say:
I shall never Impugn the motives of
newspapers when they criticise the ac
tions of the Judge here or anybody else
in this court. I am satisfied that they
will endeavor to do justice, and if they
wrens anybody they will do so inadver
tently. I will always try to do my duty,
my public duty, as I see and understand
It and endeavor to prevent fraud betns
perpetrated upon the court. The action
of the press In this matter Is something
that I think has been of great advantage
to the community.
That shows a proper and becom
ing spirit. It is much better than
taking "high ground" and summon
ing newspaper men to be punished
for "contempt" In daring to publish
the truth. It conciliates public sen
timent and tends to make people
believe that Judge Troutt has been
the victim of a gros3 deception and
is not a party to the wrongdoing.
A rogue on the bench would have
been disposed to take "high ground"
in the matter and summon report
ers and publishers to show why
they should not be punished for
"contempt of court," when perhaps
they had been doing their best to
conceal it.
â¢ â¢ â¢
(GRASS VALLEY UNION.)
The disclosures at San Francisco
regarding the Joseph Sullivan estate
have been of the most scandalous
character. Attorney Chretien, who
has long had a shady reputation,
has been obliged to confess that by
means of forgery and false persona
tion he Imposed a bogus heir upon
the Superior Court and so obtained
a fraudulent distribution of an es
tate of $5000. The legal rascal has
been sent to jail, and should be
made to serve a term at San Quen
tin. There are many such lawyers
who merit the same treatment, but
they are smart enough to keep out
of the clutches of the law. Proba
bly there are numerous frauds of
the sort just disclosed in the Sulli
van estate, and the courts have had
a shock they will not soon forget.
â¢ â¢ , 5 â¢ .
(ALAMEDA ARGUS.)
The lawyer Chretien wants to
be turned loose, declaring that
he has a purpose to "go to
the Orient." If he will give
bonds to never let up traveling till
he gets to Peking his proposition
may be fair enough in the abstract,
but there is not much moral stabil
ity in letting a man off who has of
fended one set of people upon the
promise that he will not do it to
them any more, but will go and do
it to somebody else. It is good sensÂ©
and good policy to nab a criminal
or a flea wherever you come up
with him. In this case there are
undoubtedly others. And there Is
an abiding suspicion^ that the oth
ers are more anxious for Chretien
to go to the Orient than he Is. " -

Federal Quarantine.
Dr. Kinyoun. Federal quarantine officer,
has ordered a quarantine against all ves
sels jind passengers coming from Hawaii
and Alaska because of the existence of
smallpox and typhoid fever at Nomevand
the alleged plague at Honolulu.
A local minister is convinced that if the diplomats
in China had paid more heed to the missionaries the
frightful reign of blood which is now affrighting the
world would not have happened. Some of the mis
sionary societies might wisely reach a conclusion that
the cost of their operations is now being counted in
somethine more precious than coin.

Attempts to Throw Carbolic Acid Into
His Face, but Liquid Burns
Her Own.
A young woman, barely more than a
girl, driven Insane by jealousy, attempted
to thow carbolic acid into the eyes of her
lover, on Mission street, near Fourth,
early yesterday morning, with disastrous
results to herself. The woman, who says
her name is Mrs. I^ong. trJls conflicting
stories. She says she was a mother at
15, and left her husband when the baby
v/as a year old. Since then she has cared
for herself. Unfortunately for all con
cerned she fell in love with a machinist.
The machinist had other sweethearts, and
of course there was trouble.
Mrs. Long laid in wait for her lover yes
terday morning, having learned that he
was paying particular attention to a young
woman employed In a Third-street res
taurant. When he approached she at
tempted to throw carbolic acid into his
eyes, and he.- putting up his hand in self
defense, caused the deadly fluid to fall all
over her own face. Â«â¢
The woman was taken' to the Harbor
Hospital, where Drs. Robinson and Bauer
did everything possible for her. She told
about a dozen different stories and must
have a vivid imagination, albeit she is not
yet out of her teens. . With scarce a
tremor in her voice she Raid she was
married when 14 and was a mother in her
fifteenth year. She deserted her husband
In Sacramento and came to San Fran
cisco. Here she met the machinist. She
went to work In a restaurant, and when
nfr lover failed to keep his appointments
she secured the enrbolic acid.
Mrs. Long was progressing toward re
covery last night, and the chances are
that her eyesight will not suffer.
YOUNG WOMAN TRIES TO
BUND HER FICKLE LOVER
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, CAMP
O'RYAN, SANTA CRUZ, July 17.â
There are 42O"contented cadets In
camp. They are as happy as a lit
tle boy at a circus. Three hearty
meals a day and plenty of fun are
making the boys feel like kings. Camp is
also a stern reality. Colonel Power and
his officers are keeping up the discipline
of the camp as In the regular army. As
an illustration of the discipline of the
camp, a cadet must salute the flag when
entering or leaving it, and If he falls to
do so his attention Is pointedly called
to the rule by one of the guards, and if he
refuses to honor Old Glory by doffing his
hat he is promptly thrown into the guard
house. It Is pleasant to relate that not
a cadet has been arrested for this breach
of military etiquette. Patriotism is not
lacking at Camp O'Ryan.
This morning the cadets lined up on the
beach and in the presence of hundreds
presented a programme of comic games.
In the evening the first sergeants of the
regiment held a dance in the pavilion at
the beach. An excellent orchestra ren
dered dance music and the affair was
highly successful.
Doctor Hopper, commander of Company
A, is the happiest man in camp. He is
the possessor of a piano, an organ, a rag
time player and a church organist. He
also boasts of a "macaroni" band, which
is composed of a banjo, guitar, violin and
accordion. The vicinity of his quarters is
always crowded with visitors, and the
popular captain is continually playing the
host. Sam Yale does fancy stunts on the
piano, Achille Artigues plays doleful se
lections on the organ. Joe Smith trums
the banjo. Sergeant Wilson manipulates
the guitar and Jimmy Rothberg scrapes
the violin. In addition to the foregoing
talent, the doctor has two prize cake
walkers in Will Hurley and Joe Smith and
a clever minstrel In Kd Moore.
The "Katzenjammer Kids" held a
funeral this morning. James Welch of
Company D was proven a "dead one."
and had to be interred with military hon
ors. Mr. Welch was laid out in state in
his bunk, his saber placed at his side and
a piece of black cloth hung on the ridge
pole of his tent, as a sign that Jimmy had
departed this earth. Welch proved a live
ly corpse, however, and before he cou'.d
be taken to the place of burial he com
plained bitterly that the pallbearers were
carrying him over the bumps with body
racking speed. He was prevailed on to re
main quiet for the nonce and made a good
corpse. The "Katzenjammer Kids" were
the chief mourners, but Jimmy Welch had
many friends. The latter marched behind
the stretcher upon which he was carried

wore every conceivable style of costume.
They marched in solemn tread to th^ muf

On arriving at the place of burial Welch

friends danced around his body the bugler
blew "taps." after which the" corpse and
the mourners marched back to the camp

as he is called by his companions, wrote
the following parody on the "Charge of

bly apologizes to Tennyson:
Half a step, half a step, half a step onward
Into the baseball grounds marched the four

"Forward the Pie Brigade, It's time now to

Lined up ready to "scorpe"
Stood the four hundred.
"Forward the Pie Brigade" â was there a man
dismayed?
Not though we could 8ee that the coffee was
jallaped. ~
There's not to make reply, there's no chance

Flashed all their knives so bare, flashed as
they turned in air.
Slashing the beefsteak there, cleaning the plate
go bare.
While the waiters all wondered. Charging a
plate of beans,
(Brown beans with gaping seams).
Into the bread they dug,
Every one eating.
Beans to the right of them, pancakes to the left
of them.
Pies all around them, were shattered and sun
dersd.
"Scorping" with knife and fork, wasting no
time to talk.
Filled bo they could not walk.
Were the four hundred.
Finished, they were at last
Through with one more, repast;
Kow they don't walk bo fast, â¢
Not the four hundred.
To "Doc" Morrlsey straight they go,
Every one walking slow,

Stood the four hundred.
Oh! what a stomach ache.
All hand* a pill must take.
When can their glory fade?
Oh! the wild charge they made;
Kven Abrams wondered.
Honor the charpe they made,
Honor the Pie Brigade,
Hungry four hundred.
James McNamara. one of the bass drum
soloists in the regiment, Is a candidate for
guardhouse honors. James is not as stout
as Major Duffy, nor is he as handsome,
yet all the maids in Santa Cruz cast ador
ing eyes on him. When Major Duffy left
for the ball last night he forgot to lock
up his fatigue coat, and McNamara took
possession of It. He then proceeded to tho
Seabeach Hotel atid won a few hearts, and
went on a conquering expedition up Pacific
avenue. While smiling on a fair one on
that thoroughfare Colonel Power hove in
sight'and upon seeing McNamara exposed
his duplicity in the presence, of his lady
friend. He then added Insult to injury by
ordering McNamara to go to the guard
house, which the latter sheepishly did.
"The Bullglnes." Bob McDermott, P.
Sullivan. George Winters, "Billy" Keenan
and "Billy" Dillon, refused to leave their
warm beds for the guardhouse at an early
hour this morning, and were reprimanded
by the colonel. One of their number
aroused the whole camp by setting off a
pack of giant firecrackers, and when the
officer of the guard entered their tent the
quintet was sleeping as peacefully as ba
bies.
During the skirmish drill this mowiing
Lieutenant Colonel McGloin charged on a
hat and knocked it awry. The owner of
the tile Is now seeking a pension, but the
brave officer declines to aid him.
"High Private" George Qulnn. the come,
dian of Company H. was detailed for
guard duty last night and was himself
placed in the guard tent for disturbing the
camp. Quinn was not satisfied with call
ing out the guard to arrest Father O'Ryan,
but at the end of each hour he would yell
at the top of his voice, "Post No. 4, and all
Is pretty good." "Dago" Rossi has earned
a prize for being the nerviest cadet in
camp. He was doing guard duty last
r.lght and his station was along the high
board fence which runs in back of the
camp. Instead of walking his beat, he se
cured a pick and shovel and prepared a
nice hole under the fence so that he could
beat the guard the following night. He
was captured red-banded by the officer of
the guard and thrown into the guardhouse
to repent.
HOW SOME OF THE* CADETS ARE SPENDING THEIR TIME AT SANTA CRUZ.
Durer. The works by RapFael, Titian
and Correggio in this group are far
famed. Engravings and photographs
have made them known the world over.
In the center of the room are five very
celebrated marble sculpturesâ the Medici
Venus (found in the sixteenth century
in the villa of Hadrian, near Tivolb. the
Young Apollo (of the school of Prax
iteles), the Grinder (found at Rome in the
sixteenth century), the Satyr playing on
the cymbal (restored by Michael Angelo)
and the group of the Wrestlers. Suites
of picture galleries open to right and left
from the Tribune, containing a vast and
priceless collection of paintings of the
Tuscan, Lombard and Venetian, the
Dutch. Flemish. German and French
schools.
The history of Tuscan painting begins
with Cimabue. whose Madonna, in the
Church of Santa Maria Novella. Florence,
a dim, quaint and faded work, has been
called the seed from which the variegated
flower of Italian art sprung. It takes us
back to the birth of the art. more than
six centuries ago. Stiff and formal as it
is. there is a dignity in the figures, a
Kravp sweetness in the faces and an hon
rst observation of nature in the forms
which are. in comparison with the Byzan
tine mosaics and paintings that went be
fore it. extraordinary. In the' Church of
Santa Croee are Giotto's frescoes illus
trating the lives of the two Sts. John and
of St. Francis of Asrisi: and in tho pic
turesque palace of the Podesta. now the
National Museum, is the same artist's
fresco painting of Paradise.
But to get a more complete !ri>a of what
Giotto stood for in the history of the
school we must go to Assisi. more than
100 miles sunth of Florence. It is in such
nooks that one often finds the most beau
tiful products of Italian art. In the
solemn old convent of the Franciscans at
Assisi Giotto painted on the walls a not
able series of scenes from the life of the
gODtJe saint that founded it. Giotto's first
work was don** here in the upper church,
and consists of twenty-eight frescoes, all
from his own designs, and several entirely
painted by his own hand. The church is
now used" as a museum of Tuscan fres
coes. Giotto. In honoring St. Francis, did
not forget to immortalize upon these walls
one of the most lovable traits of the monk
âhis well-known affection for birdsâ and
the delightful lrgend of the saint's ser
mon to the birds is set forth with rare
svmpathv. The gentleness and kindness
of the saint's attitude, his gesture, care
fully restrained lest a sudden movement
might alarm his timid auditors, are most
charming, and the simplicity and direct
ness of the work are admirable. In the
lower church, begun in 122S. a somber
edifice, aie some of the greatest master
pieces of Cimabue and Giotto and some,
of the leading painters of central Italy.
Giotto's in this lower church of Asslsl con
sists of four large paintings, which oc
cupv the triangular spaces in the vault
above the high altar; and these were
done In the later vears of his life. Hither
to we have seen him illustrating incident:
but here he enters a broader field and
describes principles In the form of the
three cardinal virtues of the Franciscan
or( l er _Pnverty. Chastity and Obedlence
bv which is "inculcated thp duty of the
followers of the .Â«alnt to lahor without
reward, pleasure or freedom. These works
are aptly representative of the symbolical
art which the early Tuscan painters so
brilliantly developed, and are the ablest
achievements of Giotto.
Giotto has left traces of himself from
Naples all the way to Padua He went
to the latter town to visit his friend
â¢nante. who was in exile there, and he
Sidney Dickinson, "but to mrÂ» they appear
as the loveliest pictures In the world; they
are so calm and peaceful, so exalted in
imagination, so refined in workmanship.
I cannot but feel that here was one who
had full faith and happiness in what hÂ»*
described, and if heaven ever showed its
glories to mortals his eyes were blessed
with that wonder."
Before leaving Florence It may be wÂ»>ll
to indicate brrrfly the riches of the collec
tion of old masters in the Pitti Palace by
mentioning the more famous works, whirh
include Raphael's â¢'Madonna del Balrla
chino." "Madonna del Granduca," "Vision
of Ezekiel," "Tommaso Fedr.i Jnghirani."
"Cardinal Bibbiena." "Pope Julius II.*
"Madonna del Impannata." '"!\Jadonna df>l
la Seggiola." "I-eo X and the Cardinals
de' Medici and Tie' Rossi," "Anpiolo Doni ."
"Portrait of Maddalena Strozzi Doni": Ti
tian's "La Bella." "Ippolit:-> de' Medici."
"Philip II of Spain." "bacchanalian,"
"Masdalene," "Retrothal of St. Catha
rine" and various portraits of thÂ° highest
ord*>r of merit, with several equally cele
brated examples of the art of Botticelli.
Fra Bartolommeo. Veronese, Andrea <W
Sarto. CorrejTKjo. Rembrandt. Ruben?. Sal
vator Rosa. Giorgione. Guido Reni. Leon
ardo da Vinci. Tintoretto. Van L>yck and
others. There 'are in all over fl\*e hun
dred pictures, hung in a suite of fine ga 1 
leries. There is ample material for whnl>-Â»
volumes of comment in Florence alom*.
but we are obliged to turn to other Italian
art centers.
The genius of Michael Angplo as an
architect is revealed in the solemn and
stately simplicity of the dome of St.
Peter's at Rome, and his genius as a
painter is to be seen in the decorations of
the Sistine chapel of the Vatican. The
Vatican is the largest palaeo in the world,
and the perioÂ«l of its construction extend
ed, with sundry interruptions, from the
fifth to the sixteenth century. It is built
around twenty courts and contains H.iVO
rooms, of which the greater portion arÂ«
occupied as collection and show rooms,
and comparatively few by the Papal courr.
The building's chief interest for us is in
the representation it makes of the greatest
of the Italian rainters. whom the wealth
and power of the church drew hither for
the decoration of its shrines and palaces.
Rome had no. painters of her ownâ the
stream that fed her flowed down from
Florence. Siena and t'mbrla, bringing
with It on successive floods Giotto. Fra
Angelico. Botticelli. Signorelli. Perugino
and. at the last simultaneously. Ttaphael
and Michael Angelo. All of these, snvs
Giotto, left their marks upon the walls
of the Vatican, which thus becomes the
greatest storehouse in the world of tha
Christian art of the fifteenth and six
teenth centuries.
The work of Michael Angelo Is confined
to the ceiling and end wall of the Sistine
chapel, the private place of worship of the
Popes. The sides of the chapel are deco
rated with masterly works by the earlier
artists of the renaissanceâ Pcruglno. tho
T'mbrian master: Botticelli, the Floren
tine, and Slgnorellt of Cortona. whose
greatest achievement is to be seen at Or
vieto. First w*>re painted here the leading
events in the life of Moses: later were de
picted the baptism of Christ, the sermon
on the mount ard other Incidents In tho
life of Jesus. Then the work waited for
Michael Argclo. whoso hand, responsive to
his mighty thought, should connect in
epic grandeur the history rf the old and
new dispensations, ar.d close th>Â» cycle
with the thunders of judgment and the
doom of the world.
Dante, who was in exile tnere. ana ne
decorated the little church nf Our Lady
of the Arena with frescoes from the life
of Christ, which series ended, in the fash
ion of the time, with a picture of thr last
ludjrment and of hell, full of Dantesque
fancies made visible. These, frescoes are
very curious. One represents the betrayal
of Christ, to whose face the artist has
eiven a jtrlklnc expression of reproach,
whlie he has favored Judas with one of
the meanest countenances known to art.
The sense of a large crowd Is well ex
pressed: the tumult, confusion and flight j
of thp disciples. Ttut the best work in the
old church at Padua is the "Entomb- !
ment." an admirable composition, in |
which the faces express a keen and ab
sorbing prief. The artist introduces a fine
touch here in his delineation of angels
joinintr lxi the lamentations of men.
In the history of Italian art the Campo
Santo (Holy Field) of Fisa has an im
portant place and contains some extraor
dinary works. In the succession of charm
ing arcades surrounding the cemetery Is a
peries of mural paintings coverlner nearly
15,000 square feet,, by Andrea Orcapna.
PIctro Lorenzetti. Andrea da Firenzo. PpI
nello Aretino. Francesco da .Voltcrra. Pie
tro dl Puccio. Benozzo Gozzoli an.l others.
Two of the most remarkable frescoes In i
this great series are attributed by YasHrl j
to Orcaqna. They depict the resurrection
of the dead and the last judgment. Terr'
ble visions are these â at least they must
have been terrible to those who believed
in their reality.
It is a relief to turn from such gloomy
Xote â This study, by W. II. Downes of
Boston, will be concluded next week.

LEAGUE CADETS MAKE MERRY
IN THEIR CAMP AT SANTA CRUZ
III.
The/great art centers of Italy are Flor
ence, Venice and Rome: but to the stu
dent of art there are invaluable -essona
to be learned In many of the lesser Ital
ian cities, such as Asslsi, Pisa, Siena,
Orvieto, Milan, Parma, Mantua and
Padua. In fact, all Italy might be called
a vast treasure house of art. and to the
student and historian who wishes to ob
tain a just and adequate view of the de
velopment of Italian art the old towns
mentioned, and possibly others besides,
afford indispensable data, more often to
be found in churches and convents than
in picture galleries. Florence is one of
the most remarkable art capitals of the
world. It is crowded with masterpieces
of painting, sculpture and architecture to
a degree that is amazing. Its chief mu
seums of art are the I'fllzi and the Plttl.
The Uffizi Gallery, which originated with
the Medici collections, to which many ad
ditions were made by the Lorraine fam
ily, is now In extent and value one of the
first in the world. The Tribune is a room
in which aro brought together the most
valuable masterpieces of sculpture and
painting in an extraordinary galaxy. The
pictures in this group include Raphael's
"Madonna With the Goldfinch," "The
Youthful John." "The Fornarina," etc.:
Corregrio's "Repose During the Flight
Into Kgypt." "Madonna." etc.; Titian's
"Venus," "A Prelate," etc., and selected
examples of Mantegna, A. Carracci. Fra.
Bartolommeo. Van Dyck. Guercino.
Guido, Andrea del Sarto. Domenichino.
Ribera. L. Carracci. Giulio. Romano. Ru
bens, Michael Angelo. Cranach, Veronese,
Luini. Lucas of Leyden. Francia. Peru
gino, Baroccio. Orazio Alfanl. Daniel da
Volterra, Schidono, Lanfranchi and
subjects to thÂ« works of the fainter of
heaven, Fra Ar.gelico. Him we tinil at
home in the convent of St. Mark in Flor
ence, one of the most charming spots in
Italy' br^nuse of the presence of his sim
ple. sTv*vt and reflective works. One of
his designs shows two monks welcoming a
wraiy traveler, whom the artist reveals to
j us aa Jesus himself, though his hosts d<>
! rot yet recopnlze him. Nothing couM ex-
I presfl more beautifully the virtue and.ro
ward of hospitality; It touches at once'the
keynote of ,\ngelico's art. Quite repre
sentative also Is the fresco of the "Annun-
I elation" in one of the cells on the upper
i floor of the convent. His most important
work in the convent is the "Madonna and
Child." enthroned and surrounded by va-
I rious saints. The most beautiful feature
I of the picture is the flRure of the your.jf
! J*<=u<>. But Fra. Angrelico's masterpiece is
' the "Coronation of the Virgin." in the
| Vffizi gallery. His "Paradise" in the Acad
emy comes very near it in merit, bft la
injured by the "description of hell which
the painter put into it. probably apainst
his own judgment; for although he spared
; no pains in depicting: the joys of the
blessed, he presented the pains of the lost
I in a hurried and unfinished way. It Is Im
possible to think of such Â¦ man as tnkirff
any pleasure in suffering: he was at lvs
best only in works of a jrcntle character.
In delineation of celestial visions lay his
greatest power, where the faces are all of
Â¦ exquisite beauty, the color a blending of
tender shades of rose, lilac, nzure and
! pearl, the angels glittering with jeweled
i wings against the sroldon sky in which the
I scene is enacted. The whole impression ta
of some blissful incident occurring in re
gions that are not of this world-. The fip
ures. although having human form, are of
' superhuman beauty, and the angels show
themselves as intelligences whose thought.-*
our mortal reason cannot comprehend. "I
t do not know how others may be affected
by the works of this humble rnonk.'Vsays

WHEAT FREIGHTSâ Ships are asking 40s,
usual options, with but little spot business and
a slow but steady increase in the disengaged
tonnage here. The chartered wheat fleet in
port has a registered tonnage of 32,779, against
4O.4CO tons on the same date last year; dis
engaged. 13,430 tons, against 7600; on the way
to this port. 177,800 tons, against 213.500.
WHEAT-Chicago opened at ilMc. broke to
7i',ic. at which figure there were outside sales.
Subsequently the market recovered to 77Â»4c At
the opening the feeling was better on steadier
cables, but Corn was weak on country selling
anl became completely demoralized. This
break in Corn extended sympathetically to
Wheat, cauFinr lt to decline to 70VSc. as men
tioned Afterward the market steadied. Ex
porters totk 2,000,000 bushels in all positions on
Monday, but speculation remained weak. The
Northwest brought freely.
In the local market there was a fair demand
on shipping account at previous prices. Fu
tures opened lower, but closed at an advance.

.Vrtt' York Stock Market.
â¢CITW YORK. July 17.â ThÂ«Â» stock market gave
continuous evidence to-day of operations by an
Influential bull party. Th*"ir effort! to advance
iricfs met with considerable success and were
Â£->piFted by a fharo upward movement In a
nuir.!*r cf individual Ftocks in which an out-
Handing i-hort interest was driven to cover.
liusinesK continued larcely in professional
Lands. The general list was rather neglected
End price movements were rather unimportant.
t>Ct net gai-iS were gvn*-ra!iy registered at the
cSqk of the day. The manipulative character
at the market was evident frcm the circulation
of several extravagant rumors from time to
time. l!ut the resulting pain? \v*- re pretty well
heM an>J the pressure of jtront -taking at the ad
vance was not Fufficii-nt to cauj-e any very de
cided pet back. The tone cf the market at the
cloR* was rather easy and dull at concessions
''. -<Tn the best. Thi? was due rather to a j>aus-<^
la the bull manipulation than to any large sell
ing. L'r.;<it; Pacific wÂ« the most conspicuous
stock on the list and resumed Its upward move
ment early 111 'he day. Hijrher quotations from
London helped the advance. The news
of tlic fall of Tientsin encouraged â¢sen
timent there. A period of dullness and
relaj>se followed the higher opening, which
â¢*as ar];arÂ«ntiy due to the check to the
upward tendency in JSalttmore and Ohio. Some
rinulp'.fs v.ere ra.--t < -n yesterday's confident pre
dictions c;f early divifjf-nd action on this stock.
The market maintained an attitude of Indiffer
ence Cor aime time to :he rapid advance scorej
â fim by Brooklyn Transit and later by Suiiar,
the f:m ml'.yiiiR V/k in<m early depression and
the latter rising nearly four points. The move
ments were due to the demand from shorts,
who Â»(it- <liÂ«fjrlje.l by the apparent willingness
of insMe Interacts in Brooklyn Transit to let
the i-tock jro iliva and liy reports of large profits
in fugar refining at the present level of prices.
There were similar movements on a smaller
wale in a naraliT of prominent specialities.
Pacific Mail roÂ«e ronsDicuously four points on
the sur>iÂ«isit!on t!:at It would be benefited by
the trar.*;>ort of troops and military supplies
to Chir.a. The upward movement in railroad
etocks was renewed aftT midday under the
Ftlmulus.of \ht-ff Fpecial movements. The
grangers. BoattrvestCTBS and Pacifies advanced
very eer.erally from 1 to l'j points and St.
Louis and San Francisco nrst preferred jumped
The movemont did not extend far outsiie the '
limits in tb.o railroad list.
The check to thÂ» advance in sterling exchange
was due to the offerings of bills acainst gold
exports. Arrangements ir- reported to have

EASTERN MARKETS.
CHICAGO, July 17.â September wheat opened
lie higher at ~'Mc to 77?gc because Liverpool
showed but a small decline in the face of the
drop here yesterday and because receipts were
small. Then the market lost Its strength be
cause corn was making such a swift break for
the bottom. September, following the opening,
worked up to 77"- 4 c and the proceedings were
rapidly downward. Liquidation was heavy
duringr the slump and demand scattered. The
speculative mind after half an hour became
more composed and concluded to buy some.
Shorts covered to secure profits and some bull
support pent the market in an upward
course. This movement was helped along by
renewed buying from the Northwest and a
decrease in the world's visible of 2.921.000
bushel!., aeccrding to I?radstreet"s. Septem
ber rallied to 77'ic and shortly afterward closed
with most of the advance held over yes
terday at 77V*Â«?77Â»ac. The rally was helped to
a degree by the partial recovery of corn.
The com market made a hollow, empty show
of having recovered somewhat from the bear
drubbing given it yesterday, but the exhibi
tion lasted for only a moment at the opening.
I.Â«onj? corn was shoveled Into the pit in im
mense quantities and inside of an hour the
market brought up over 2c under yesterday's
close on reports of excellent crop prospects as
a result of recent heavy raine. Covering by
shorts for profits caused a reaction and part
of the loss was regained, giving the close an
appearance of firmness compared with con
ditions earlier in the session. September
closed l%c under yesterday at SSH^SHc.
Trade in oats was not heavy. September
closed Â»ic down at 23?ic.
Provisions early in the session were very
weak, but part of the loss was recovered. Hogs
were easy at the yards and the corn break
was a decidedly bearish^ factor. One heavy
t-peculator let cut a long line and another 6o!d
short, this f-tuff forming the bulk of the of
ferings. The recovery, such as lt was, was on
buying bv packers. September pork closed Sjo
under yesterday; lard, 12 1 j(Jloc down and riba
I2\4$X5c depressed.

another dull fruit. Grapes and melons are al

Hooper, assistant manager of the Occi
dental. "The natural travel has been con
siderably greater than that of last year
or the previous one. Aside from this,
travel to and from the Orient is largely
increased, and, this will doubtless continue.
We are well satisfied with the situation
and look for a business thls'fall that will
keep our establishment filled to its best
capacity."
Manager. John C. Kirkpatrick of the
Palace is also satisfied that there is noth
ing the matter with San Francisco.
"Speaking of hotel business." said he.
"our trade for the first eight months of
this year has been 20 per cent better than
for the same period last year. Travel
across the Pacific is heavy both ways, and
that from other dlrocttcns is all that could
be expected. I should say that by reason
of recent improvement and the good con
ditions that now exist we will have a very
lively fall and winter travel. I think we
should be well satisfied with affairs. Our
guests all seem to have plenty of money
and they pay their bills promptly, all of
which indicates a prosperous condition
generally." :
"This month lips been the best we have
had in years," said Manager Rich of the
Grand. "Business is heavier. In fact, than
at any other time during the long period
I have been connected with the hotel. : As
an indication of trade it is only necessary
to state that there is, hardly a night that
we are not short of rooms with which to
accommodate our guests, despite the large
number we have. Traffic holds up well
under all handicaps. The indications are
exceptionally promising for a good fall
and winter trade. In short, the situation
is highly satisfactory."
Tell of Prosperity and Predict Ex
' cellent Business During the
Fall and Winter.
t==3HE leading hotels of San Francisco
are properly regarded as barometers
II of business, the ebb and flow of the
tide of travel /through their doors in
dicating whether times are good, bad or
indifferent.' This being the case, the pub
lic will read with genuine interest the
statements of the managers of these big
hostelrles as to the condition of business
in their line. These declarations are most
certainly of a cheering nature and show
the vitality of the city.
General AVarfield of the California re
gards the situation with the utmost satis
faction. "Business Is good and will be bet
ter," said he yesterday. "Notwithstand
ing scares of the Kinyoun order, we are
doing well. A year ago I said that if I
never did a better June business I would
not complain. At the close of June busi
ness this year I found that the hotel had
done more than $2000 better than in the
same month in 1659. Furthermore, the out
look is all that could be expected, and I
am satisfied that there will be a larger
trade this fall and winter than ever be
fore At this early date I have engage
ments from all ever the East. San Fran
cisco is all right, and there-are few who
realize the remarkable growth of popula
tion and business it will enjoy during the
next few years. There is nothing to stop
the progress of the city now. but an ap
preciation of tho possibilities and the exer
cise of proper enterprise will do much ip
accelerate our prosperity."
"Our business is excellent, said George

covered that the deceased left more
than $31,000 on deposit in the various
banking Institutions of this city.
Tanzer came from Santa Clara
County, where he has a small
ranch, one month ago. He secured
a room at the Contra Costa House,
a cheap lodging place at 14 Jack
son street, and bore all the evi
dences of poverty. Each night he
paid twenty-five cents for his
apartment and never displayed any
more money. He was taken ill
last week. As his condition became
worse he was conveyed to the hos
pital, where he suddenly expired.
When Deputy Meehan searched
the miser's room last night he was
surprised to find that the supposed
pauper had a certificate of deposit
on the German Bank for $13,902 09;
one on the San Francisco Savings
I'nion for $12,846 87; one on the
Bank of California for $3286 and
another on the London and San

known for more than six years as the Na

formed the bridal party made its way to
the floral railing, where the bride and
rroom knelt upon a pillow of roaes. From
the arched gateway a graceful spray ot
pink flowers swayed and from It alternate
ropes of pink geraniums and pepper leave*
radiated to the sides of the room, forming
a canopy. Palm branches and ferns were
artistically placed about the room, con
verting the whole Into a falryHke scene.

The development of the photographs
taken by Professor Charles Burckhatter
of the Chabot Observatory in Georgia
dining the solar eclipse on May 2S has
demonstrated beyond a doubt the success
of his new method of astronomical pho
tography. The negatives that were taken
have been developed Into the best pho
tojrraphs of the corona of the sun that
have ever liepn produced.
ilTetof<">re the KrÂ»-at difficulty has al
wavs been to regulate the exposure of the
film. Owirp to the difference of the in
tensity of t!'.<* rays eominp from different
part? ' "t the sun nearly all photographs
that have been taken in the pa?* have
fceen blurred. Protestor Burckhalter'fl fle J
rice controls the exposure to the different
rays, s.i that Tvh*Â»n the photograph i.= fin
ished it prt-scnt? an excellent view of the
corona. The exposure to the inner porti >n
cf the corona, which has given the b'. s=t
resiiitF. is -4-100 of a second. The oute r por
tion receives an exposure of eight see
or.rts. The device is so delicate that an
exposure of 2-1000 of a second may be
made. This Is s-om^thing that has hereto
fore been impossible. A photogranh taken
with such a short exposure is as poor as
one which has been overexposed.
Professor Hurckhalter first tried his in
vention during an eclipse in India. The
conditions, however, were not then just
rlcht. The latest experiments have thor
oughly demonst rated the practical success
<:i the device. The invention will be cf
great value to scientists in the astronom
ical world and will add considerably to the
reputation of the Chabot Observatory,
where Professor Burckhalter has pursued
his studios.
Professor Burckhalter is making lantern
slide?? from hi? negatives, and these will
be sent to astronomical stations through
out the world. Later on photographic re
productions will fee made.

the Astronomical World by the
Success of the Recent
Expedition.

struments Produce the

SON'S ECLIPSE

PHOTOGRAPHED
GEORGETOWN. Ky., July 17.â The pro
ceedings in the Powers case were made
more Interesting to-day by the introduc
tion of several witnesses who gave testi
mony against the defendant. The mo3t
Interesting witness of the day from a
standpoint disconnected from either side
of the case was Miss Lucy Brock, the
sweetheart of the young defendant. it
Is probable that either Coulton, Noakes or
Golden will be put on the stand to-mor
row to further prove the alleged, con
spiracy.
Flnlay Anderson, who was testifying
when the court adjourned yesterday, re
sumed his testimony to-day. Witness said
that on January 24 Caleb Powers told him
that a crowd of mountaineers were goin,j
to Frankfort to intimidate the Legisla
ture and if necessary to kill enough UÂ«m
ocrats to give the Republicans a majority.
The witness said:
"Powers told me Goebel would never
live to be Governor and said he (Powers)
would kill him if nobody else would."
The conversation took place on the day
preceding the day of the advent of the
12uo mountaineers into ir'rankfort. Wit
ness said he heard Powers and others
talking about Goebel wearing a coat of
mail, but some of them said that ha
could be killed anyway. Powers was m
conference with Secretary of rftate
Charles Kinley, Wharton Golden, Robert
N'oakes and others. Only once during this
testimony did the defendant's features
show signs of agitation.
"Witness Becomes Agritated.
Under cross-examination the witness
stated he had called .on Colonel T. C.
Campbell in Cincinnati, out became badly
confused and could not recall who ac
companied him to Colonel Campbell,
though he claimed several people were
with him at the time. He denied that
either Justus or Arthur Goebel assisted
him in getting employment in Cincinnati
and denied that his trip to Cincinnati wad
for the purpose of becoming a witness in
the Powers trial.
The witness denied that he had been
promised compensation for his evidence.
It developed that young Anderson had
made an artidavit In Cincinnati which is
in possession of Colonel Campbell, and the
delense asked that this be produced- in
court. The court ruled that it must be
produced.
On redirect examination witness said he
did not volunteer as a -witness, but re
ceived a letter while at Knoxville, Tenn..
asking him to go to Cincinnati, and telling
him that he was wanted as a witness.
Defendant's S-weetheart Testifies.
Miss Lucy Brock of London, Laurel
County, was the next witness. She knew
the defendant well and had corresponded
with him for over two years past. Caleb
Powers called on her in January. He told
witness he was getting up a crowd of luw
mountain men to go to Frankfort, "so
that In case the Democrats robbed them
of the State offices they could take care
of themselves." Â»
Witness said Powers had $1100 In bills.
He told her Governor Taylor furnished
the money, and It was to be used to bring
the men to Frankfort.
"Miss Brock said Powers told her the
plan to take the 1000 mountain men to
Frankfort was Governor Taylor's crea
tion. The defense did not cross-examine

Remarkable Confession of Eliza Wise
Clears Away a Mystery in
Minnesota.
ANOKA, Minn.. July 17.â The recent
mysterious shooting of William Wise and
his wife was solved to-day by the con
fession of Eliza Wise, the younger of tho
Wise girls, that the defendants, James
Hardy and Elmer Miller, committed the
murder. She practically admitted that the
plot to shoot her parents was formed
with the knowledge of herself and her
sister. The mother had $1500 in the bank,
which was to^o to her daughters in case
of her death, and the girls had said they
would divide with their suitors when Mrs.
Wise was dead.
The father had forbidden thÂ© boys to
call on his daughters, and so he was in
cluded in the plot. Eliza testified that
she saw the boys. and their guns outside
the house before the shooting. The girl's
story created a profound sensation, as the
defendants had established a tentative
alibi, and it was generally believed that
they were innocent.
FOOD IS SCARCE.
The Government of Colombia âCard-
Pressed to Feed Its Soldiers.
KINGSTON, Jamaica, July 17.â Further
news from Colombia Is to the effect that
up to July 13 Panama was still held by
the Government. The rebels in the vicin
ity were expected to begin operations
soon. The Government troops have been
strongly reinforced by drafts from Colon,
but it is the general opinion -that the
rebels can take Panama any time they
like. It is reported that the rebels are
led by an American military expert. Tho
Government is in dreadful straits for food
with which to feed troops and is seizing
cattle from residents.

this morning hanging by a rope from a
limb of a small fir tree. Humphreys was
the guardian of Mrs. Amanda Shipley, an
Insane ward, "and also administrator of
the estate of the late Judge Humphreys,
his father. It is thought that worry over
the condition of these estates and other
financial troubles caused him to turn to
suicide -us the speediest solution of the
difficulty. â¢
Vivid Scene Enacted on a Chicago
Building Worthy of a Chapter
in a Dime Novel.
CHICAGO, July 17.â The exciting spec
tacle of two men fighting fiercely 175 feet
above the ground, with a constant clanger
of being plunged to certain death below,
was witnessed by a great crowd about the
rew Coliseum building.
Richard Collins was distributing cinders
about on the roof of the big structure,
while J. R. I lowland was at work on the
ground 175 feet below. A brick from above
dropped and grazed his head. Angered,
he went to the roof and accused Collins
of dropping it. They soon began to tight.
The roof is only twenty-four feet w.Â»de
and slants at an angle of twenty degrees.
The fight took place on the west side of
the apex of the roof. A misstep would
have hurled the combatants to certain
death on the stonework below.
The attention of Charles Wilson, fore
man in charge of the expanded metal
work, was attracted by the struggle of thu
two men. Calling to several laborers he
rushed to the' scene of the conflict. Ho
arrived on the scene in time to seize the
lighters as thev were in imminent peril
of falling together over the edge to wait
ing death.
The men were separated and Foreman
Wilson sent for assistance from the police,
who arrested the fighters. Howland was
seriously injured.

pleaded guilty In the -.Marylebone Police
Court yesterday to the charge of stealing
a gold watch, a bracelet, hairbrush and
articles of clothing of the aggregate value
of Â£22 from rooms in Norfolk Mansion's

When Miss Keyes was arrested she
finally opened her trunk and displayed the
missing articles. Her explanation was
that she had been drinking brandy, and
while under the influence or the liquor
took the property. When she realized the
enormity of her action the next mornius
she tried to return the stolen property
but was unable to gain access to the
rooms she had robbed. In the course of
the hearing Miss Keyes said she was an
American and had come to London to at
tend the World's Christian Endeavor Con
vention as a delegate from a church A iu
Minnesota. Ultimately Miss Keyes. who
said she was without money, was re
manded to allow her to call witnesses as
to her character.

Fell Asleep While on Duty â Sergeant
Price's Appeal Is Partly
>,; ; Heard.
The Police Commissioners last night dis
missed ' Officer Charles Green -from -the
force for falling to answer to two alarms
of fire on July 4 and also for falling asleep
while, on duty. After the verdict of the
Commissioners was rendered. Green un
pinned his star and threw it on the floor
at the- feet of President Newhall.
Special Officer William Mullaney was
relieved of his star for plying Regular Of
tlcer Henry Smith with whisky while the
last named was onduty. Smith was fined
$100 at the last meeting for accepting the
liquor from the special.
Detectives Thomas Gibson and Egan
filed written charges against Leo Franks,
Â¦who conducts a saloon at 2S2 O'Farrell
street, accusing him of refusing to give
them information concerning the stabbing
of James -Turner by his mistress, and en
deavoring to hide the knife used by the
Infuriated woman. The stabbing occurred
in Franks' saloon, but when questioned by
the detectives -he stoutly maintained that
he knew nothing about it. He also at
tempted to mislead the detectives by giv
ing them a wrong description of the
woman. After listening to a mass of evi
dence, the Commissioners decided not to
revoke Franks' license, but warned him to
be more discreet in the future.
The petition of Serjeant Price to be re
stored to the rank of lieutenant was then
taken up. .President â¢ Newhall did not
think that the Commissioners had any
right to Interfere in the matter. He said
that he was led to believe. that. Price was
disrated because he failed to exercise the
proper authority over the men.
Commissioner McNutt declared that' In
his opinion the Commissioners should
not Interfere with the acts of the previous
board in disrating certain members of the
force. He was unalterably opposed to re
instating expelled or disrated members of.
the departments
After some further discussion it was de
cided to thoroughly Investigate the dls
ratinsr of Price at.the next meeting of the
board. * â¢â¢ "'^0sS^sS^3^^^i^^fk
POLICEMAN GREEN THROWS
STAR AT NEWHALL'S FEET
Thieves are again operating at North
Beach. Two complaints of burglaries have
recently been received at the California
street police station and in one of the
cases the amount stolen aggregates hun
dreds of dollars.
J. C. Astredo of 914 Vallejo street vis
ited the country with his family about a
month ago. He locked up his house and
thotignt he had left everything secure.
Last Friday evening he returned and
upon entering the house discovered that
thieves had been there In his absence.
The building had been ransacked from
basement to garret and everything of
value taken.
Astredo. reported the matter to the po
lice that evening. The officers sent to in
vestigate the matter think from the de
scription of some of the articles stolen
that the thieves must have backed an
express wagon up to the door and carted
their plunder away. All the silverware
and jewelry in the house to the amount
of several hundred dollars was stolen, a
number of valuable skins and rugs ani
some furniture.
While Mrs. Rose Granzelle of 640 Bay
street was visltlnpr a friend on Friday
afternoon thieves entered her home an<l
ransacked the premises. All of value they
secured was $5 In coin. She reported the
matter that night to the police.

Sunday afternoon as it was struggling to
reach the shelter of a little cove. Tha
awful accident occurred within plain view
of four men, but owing to the fact that
their own craft had been disabled by the
heavy wind, compelling them to run in
under the lee of Angel Island for repairs,
they were unable to make any attempt at
rescue, even if that had been possible.
In fact the disaster occurred so quickly
that the four men on the opposite sld"e
of the straits were for the time being
uncertain whether the little craft with
Its two occupants had gone to the bottom

which when last seen they were endeav

as to the fate of the young people was
dissipated to-day when two reliable wit

Demands Divorce From Her Hus
band, the Well-Known Artist
and Club Man.
Mrs. Grace M. Dickman <nee Patterson)
filed suit yesterday for a divorce from her!
husband, Charles J. Dickman. artist. Bo- I
htfmian. club man and former senior part
ner in the Dickman-Jones Lithographing
Company. ThÂ»Â» attorneys hinted at failure
to provide as the cause of action, but It
is said by others acquainted with the cou
ple that there are other grounds. The pa
pers are under f=eal.
Three years apro Mr. and Mrs. Dickman I
went to Paris, where the former stud- i
ied art. Mrs. Dickman returned to her |
home In this city About two years ago, i
but Piokman Is still residing in Paris so !
far as is known. He is especially well j
known in the world of art. his pictures
ofttimes being socn In the Paris Salon.
On one occasion he won the Grand Prix.
Mn=. Dickman was MIfs Grace Patter- I
pon. a daughter of Mrs. Dohrmann. Pret- j
ty and talented. f=he occupied an enviable !
position in society. In consequence, her j
action for divorce will attract more than
usual attention whr-n it is called for hear
ing.
GRACE M. DICKMAN SUES
TO LOOSE MARITAL TIE
or had disappeared around the point.
There can hardly be any question, how
ever, |n view of all the circumstances,
that the boat was lost and that its two
unfortunate passengers who shared us
fate were the missing daughter of Con
tractor Charles A. Warren and the young
clubman, Tobias J. Kelly, who was her
escort on that lamentable trip on the bay.
Carl F. Seifert. a cigarmaker, residing
at 4145 Twenty-third street, San Fran
cisco, was the first to tell the story of the
drowning and he declares that he and
three companions were eye-witnesses to
the silent tragedy. The others were Fel.'x
Lesterhan of Chesley street. Emmet Cuni
merford of 2736 Folsom street and H. Per
renaud of 3269 Twenty-fourth street, a!l
of. San Francisco. These four started
from Fourth-street wharf in the Whirl
wind, the queer craft formerly owned by
the late E. A. von Schmidt, for a day's
fishing. A gale was blowing outside and
before they reached their destination the
gaff snapped short off and they were com
pelled to put back. They dropped anchor
under the lee of Hospital Point. Angel
Island, and started to repair damages. It
was while thus engaged that they wit
nessed the sinking of the little craft with
a man and a woman, supposed to have
been Miss Warren and Kelly, aboard.
Self ert says:
"It all happened so quickly that it is
hard to realize that we may have seen
those two young people drowned not half
a mile from where their friends were. We
started out from Fourth-street wharf
early Sunday morning. We went outside
the heads for a while and then as the
wind was blowing so stiff we put the boat
about and ran into the smooth water un
der the lee of Hospital Point on Angel
Island. You T can se,e what that sou'
wester was like when I tell you that our
jib was blown clean away as we came
down the bay, and our gaff snapped like a
pipestem just as we came up into the
wind off Tiburon. We ran down the Rac
coon Straits to Hospital Cove and put
in there to lie by till we could repair the
damages.
"We had not been there more than- an
hour or so when Lesterhan called my at
tention to a catboat on the opposite side
of the straits, off Lyfords Tower Point.
She was acting so strangely that we all
quit our work to watch what the fellow
handling her was trying to do. As she
rounded the Tower Point she headed In
for Lyfords Cove. We got a good view
of her then and I saw a man and a wo
man in the stern. She ran so close in
shore that we all thought she would run
aground. I think the man was trying to
get in under the lee of the point. Then all
of a sudden Losterhan hollered, 'Down!'
"We all looked at where we last saw
her and she was gone. It was then some
time between 12 and 2 o'clock. Then a
yacht, 1 think t'he Paul, hove in sight,
heading up the river. We hailed her and
tried to tell her crew what we had just
seen and get them to go over there. They
thought we were joshing, I guess, and
stood right on.' We could not get over be
cause of our broken gaff. Right after
that a yacht and a gasoline launch went
through the straits. They evidently saw
nothing, for they kept right on. I wanted
to put into Tiburon and tell of what we
had seen. Lesterhan said, 'No; it might
have been a false alarm, and if she had
gone down we would see about It in the
newspapers.' I did not think much morÂ«Â»
of it till to-day when I read about it in
The Call. I came right over to San Fran
cisco from Oakland, where I had gone to
look for work, and went up to William
â¢ Warren's office. He brought me over here
with him."
Perrenaud gave the same account of the
accident as Seifert. He says they saw a
white sail show up distinctly for a mo
ment against the dark sea and then it
seemed to lie quite flat on the water for
the space of a second or so. Then It dis
appeared. All in the' boat strained their
eyes to get another view of it, but that
was the last they saw. Had the boat not
sunk those on the Whirlwind must have
seen her again.
Up till 5 o'clock to-night, when Mr.
Warren was informed of â¢ to-day's sensa
tional developments, culminating in the
almost certain fact that his only daugh
ter and her escort have been drowned,
the contractor still hoped against hope.
Now. however, he fears that there is no
choice left him but to share the belief of
all Belvedere. To-morrow morning drags
and grappling Irons will search the bot
tom of the cove where the bodies are
said to be and put all doubt as to the re
sult of Sunday's boat ride to an end.
Seifert got up to Warren's office at 232
Montgomery street at about 3 o'clock this
afternoon. â¢ William Warren, brother of
the missing' elrl, who had Just' taken Mrs.
Warron, whose condition is quite serious,
to San Francisco, brought him over to
Tlburon and to-morrow morning the
launches Norwood and MacNelll will drag
the waters of Lyfords Cove to bring to
light what all Belvedere now fears Its
waters cover.
Lyfords Cove is a little bay just around
the point from the California Northwest
ern Ttailwav Compnnyls wharf at Tiburon.
It is formed, by two rocky capes, on one
of which is built the tower and gates
which mark the entrance to Dr. Lyford's
property and are conspicuous landmarks.
The water is about three fathoms deep in
the shallowest part. The tide which
races through the narrow Raccoon Straits
like a millrace forms here a back eddy
and any object sunk' in the cove would
probably be retained there this
cause. All the old-timers here agree that
this is the most probable place for the
boat to have sunk.
Early this morning th<> launches which
took up the hunt yesterday again started
out. only tÂ£> return' after a search of the
most careful character, without a shred
of evidence that might give a lead on the
whereabouts of the missing. s Charles A.
Warren, the lost girl's father, went with
Charley MacKelll on the latter's launch
MacNelll.- Mr. Warren returned to San
Francisco to-night wearied and depressed
by his non-success. Mrs. Warren and her
sister. Miss Smith, left Belvedere for their
town house. 2215 Van Ness avenue, on the
11:30 boat this morning. To-morrow. morn-
Ing Mr. -Warren will be over and, together
with his son .William, direct the dragging
party. The launches , Brisk and Envoy
were also chartered to aid in to-day's
search. The large lifebuoy, which many
thought might have floated In case the
catboat sank, was attached to the craft,
so this explains its non-appearance. Every
one here lays the blame for the disaster
on the tremendous amountâ 600 pounds â of
shipping ballast she carried. ..%
The boat seen and hailed by Seifert was
the Seablrd of Tlburon, and not the yacht
Paul, as he reported. The' Paul was off
Sausallto on, Sunday/afternoon, but the
Seablrd was cruising off Hospital Point
with a large fishing party on board.
Mrs. Warren was not : told- to-day of
Â¦what ; Self ert and his companions said they
had seen, as her condition Is precarious
and it Is feared that the nervous shock
mlght v produce serious consequences. Â¦

Plans Under Discussion to Further
â¢ the Interests of the Organization.
Some Excellent Papers
Are Bead.
The first annual convention of the Cali
fornia j State Stenographers' Association
was opened by President L. E. Bontz of
San Jcse In the Marble room of the Palace
Hotel yesterday morning. Only about a
score of the members were present, but
what wa's lacking in numbers was made
up in enthusiasm. The membership of
the organization is made up of otticlal
court reporters from all parts of the State,
banded together for mutual benefit and
to regulate the price of their services so
that it will be uniform throughout the
State.
Ex-Congressman Charles A. Sumner,
who was formerly omclal reporter for the
Supreme Court, maae the opening address,
winch was largely reminiscent and en
joyable. The members lost no .time In
getting down to business. With one ex
ception tne members appointed to read
papers responded heartuy, ana the ideas
they advanced were taKen up and thor
ougnly discussed by their lellow members.
One ot the papers that provoked discus
sion was that or W. K. Strong of Eureka
on "borne Phases of Shorthand Legisla
tion." He expressea the opinion thai un
til the official court stenographers could
agree among themselves upon some stan
aard of compensation either on the per
diem or fee system no good legislation
could be secured. The writer believed
that the court reporter ought to be Inde
pendent of politics, and tnat before his
appointment he ought .to be required to
pass an examination held by a State
board and thereafter hold 'his- position
during good behavior and efficiency.
This paper provoked so much discus
sion and so many suggestions were ad
vanced that it was decided to turn the
whole matter over to a committee, which
will prepare a report. C F. Whitton of
Oakland. Charles H. Adams of Santa Rosa
and E. A. Girvin were appointed by the
chair to act on the committee. They will
report this afternoon.
The subject of "The Country Reporter"
was nicely handled by Fred J. Brownlee
of Redding, who described in a humorous
way the varied duties of the shorthand
man who has a large and thinly settled
section all to himself. "Technical Report
ing" was a paper read by J. L. Holland
of this city that furnished considerable
amusement. H. A. Jones related "Some
Recollections," Ernest A. Girvin dis
cussed "Supreme Court .Reporting," L. E.
Bontz of San Jose had some suggestions
to offer as to the "Benefits of Organiza
tion" and J. E. Rich of San Bernardino
told an interesting story about "Report
ing Coroner's Inquests;" A paper that
provoked considerable discussion was that
of William Held Jr. of Ukiah on "Salary
vs. Per Diem for Court Reporters."
The convention will meet again this
morning and will be in session all day.
In the evening the visiting members of
the craft will be banqueted by the local
members. The programme for to-day In
cludes a paper on "Shorthand as a Step
ping Stone," by George W. Smith of San
Francisco. <,
