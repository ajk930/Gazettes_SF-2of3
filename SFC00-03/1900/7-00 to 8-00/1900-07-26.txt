COURIER FROM PEKING SAYS I
Majority of Foreigners

and the Condition of the
Survivors Was Hopeless.
LONDON, July 25.â The Express has
the following from St. Petersburg:
"Admiral Skreydloff. command
ing the Russian squadron In Chi
nese waters, has received precise
Instructions to bombard the Chinese coast
towns Immediately upon receipt of con
firmation of the report of the massacre
at Peking."
There Is a movement northward of
Southern Chinese troops to Join the main
army gathered to oppose the foreign ad
vance on Peking. The strength of this
principal force Is now estimated at 300,000
men.
It Is believed that about three weeks
must elapse before the Chinese war
preparations are completed. It Is rumored
that 3000 Chinese troops and more are be
ing sent to reinforce the garrison of the
Klan Tin forts, commanding the entrance
to the Yangtseklang, ninety miles cast
of Nanking.
i Chuan Chi Tung. Viceroy of Wu Chang,
on the Tangtsekiang, telegraphs that he
is apprehensive that he will not be able
to restrain his troops for more than an
other ten days. He say3 that he has
thrown the breech blocks of the guns
co'mmandlng Hankow into the river.
These signs of unrest In the southern
provinces are coincident with Li Hung
Chang's presence in Shanghai. They are
supposed to be the beginning of a general
declaration against foreigners.
According to the Shanghai correspond

This old code has been out of general
use for many years, but Minister Conger
is" one of the few officials 'who has been
using it. He does not employ the new
code.
The State Department officials decline
to discuss the story of the theft of the
codf* hook, but do enter a denial that they
ever entertained a suspicion that It had
fallen Into the hands of the Chinese Gov
ernment. It Is known that several yeara
ago a copy of the old State. Department
cipher, -which has since been changed,
was made. A copy of this, the authorl
tives have strong reason to believe, found
Its way Into the possession of another
Government â not the Chinese.
These code books are numbered and re
ceipted for when placed In the hands of
those entitled to them. An inkling was
given that the missing code book fell Into
the hands of the Chinese Government.
This Information was calculated to inspire
a doubt of the authenticity of the Conger
dispatch.
WASHINGTON, July 3.â A question on
authenticity of the dispatch from Minis
ter Conger, dated at Peking on the 15th
inst.. developed the fact to-day that sev
eral years ago a copy of the State De
partment cipher code disappeared and
never has been recovered.

envoy of the Empress Dowager In the se
cret mission to Japan. He has received
secret Instructions to remain at Shanghai
and to endeavor to open negotiations
with a view of preventing the European
advance.
LONDON, July 26.â The Shanghai
correspondent of the Daily Express
telegraphing yesterday says:
"A general rising throughout
China Is now regarded as so abso
lutely certain that all the missionaries
throughout the empire have been ordered
to take refuge without delay either at
Shanghai or Hongkong. Refugees are be
ginning to arrive from all points In the
most pitiable condition."
As the result of a constant correspond
ence with the Governor of Shantung 1 , Li
Hung Chang this afternoon announced
that the Imperial Government was pre
pared at any moment to give a safe con
voy to the members of the foreign lega
tions from Peking to Tientsin, provided
guarantee were given that no advance
would be made" upon the capital and that
all matters In dispute between China and
the powers would be made the Bubject of
friendly negotiations.
' In the same communication to the Con
suls, Earl Li said that the Imperial Gov
ernment'had submitted to the powers a
statement of Its position, declaring that it
had suffered greatly by recent events, but
desired not only to suppress the rebellion
but to remove the causes of the hostility
of foreign powers. Therefore, he hoped
that the offer to escort the foreigners to
Tientsin would be regarded as an earnest
of the desire of the' Chinese Government
for the renewalof friendly relations.
The Consuls replied that no basis for
friendly negotiations was possible until
proof was at hand that the Ministers
were still living. Consul Warren declined
to discuss the matter at all. but v in. his
reply to the French Consul La Hung
Chans undertook to obtain a satisfactory ;
As we think that In the International rela
tions of China with other governments your
honorable nation has most cordial relations
with China, and as China is to-day pressed
by circumstances up to the point of drawing;
upon herself universal wrath. In order to ar
range these difficulties and to resolve these
complications we think it Is possible that It Is
solely upon your honorable country that we
may count. Therefore, opening our heart to
you in all sincerity we demonstrate to you our
Intimate 3entiments 'and we address you this
letter In the sole hope that you will find, Mr.
President of the republic, means of arranging
matters and will take the initiative to trans
form the present situation.
' We beg you at the same time to have the
goodness to address us a kind response, which
we cannot help but await with extreme anxiety.
Signed the 23d day of the sixth moon of the
twenty-sixth year (July 19. 1900).
PARIS, July 25.â The Emperor of China
has sent to President Loubet the follow
ing letter, transmitted by telegraph by
the Governor of Shantung. July 19:
China has for several years been linked In
friendship with your honorable country. All
affairs concerning our relations on the fron
tiers of Kwangsl and Funan have been dis
cussed and settled by the way of conciliation.
There exists no grievance between us. Recently
the population and Christians found themselves
in hostility and rebellious persons have profited
by the opportunity to Indulge In depredations
with the result that foreign nations have sus
pected the court of showing partiality toward
the and of jealousy toward
the Christians. Subsequently the attack upon
and the taking of the forts at Taku took
place, after which military action and mis
fortunes ensued, rendering the situation still
more complicated and dangerous.

WASHINGTON, July 25.â The following cablegram has been received at the Navy De

has done nothing to dispel the
floittbt as to the Fituation at Peking. The
message, which vras forwarded by the
naval officers at Tientsin. Taku and Che
fu. has served only to deepen the darkest
end saddest mystery cf the century. The
cffl<5al 'â¢.or.clusicn remains unchanged, of
course, but :t is admitted that a careful
Fcrutiny of the autograph message. In
comparison with the famous cipher mts
rago from Minister Conger, admits of
th# belief that the two messages were in
dited by Mr. Conger at about the Fame
time. The situation at the British lega
tion is represented to be the same In each
case, and as ilr. Conger declares that
relief must come <;ulckly. If at all, there
Is ground for the Fuspicion that the crisis
Is over. The assumption that this reason
ing is correct involves the further conclu
sion that Mr. Conger's cipher message. If
genuine, was redated. and. of course, if
redated at all, was done by Chinese
officials. -A '
More Chinese Assurances.
On the other hand, and In support of
the State Department's position, came to
<!ay a mepsage from another of the great
ChincFe Viceroys. Taksu, at Canton, who
took charge after Li Hung's departure.
This also affirmed solemnly the safety of
the legations, and, coming from so many
different sources and from puch an im
portant Chinese official. ther<Â» dispatches
claim attention. A pessimistic view of
them, however, attributes them nil to a
common originâ namely. Borne one high
Chinese personage at Peking. It is noted
that Takfus assurance brings the Minis
ters one day further toward Jltimate res
cue than has any preceding message. The
fact that It allows only three days to
cover the transmission over the great dis
tance between Peking and Canton has at
tracted attention here, and appears to
demand explanation, if the message Is to
l>e accepted as genuine and of Peking 1
It was not known to the State Depart
ment until the publication of the fact In
the newspaper* that the French Govern
ment also had been addressed by the Chi-
nes=e Government in the effort to secure
mediation. It now appears that still
other powers were addressed in a similar
FtraJn. It la known that Great Britain
and Germany, and. probably, Russia,
have received such messages. The lan
guage 1b not the Fame, but the animating
idea is. The State department officials
pay that, generally speaking, this Idea Is
not so much to secure mediation as to
induce the powers to resort to a settle
ment of the difficulties between them and
China by the substitution of negotiations
for armed force. This appears more
clearly from a comparison of the various
notes than It did In the single note ad
1 drt-ssr-fi to the President.
War Department Energetic.
The chances of a successful outcome
; of this attempt of the Chinese Govern
ment to secure an amelioration of the
consequences of the Boxer uprising are
much diminished by the Intimation that
the powers are expected to refrain from
pressing the movement toward Peking.
On the contrary, the United States War
Department Is moving at present with
greater energy than at any time since the
original orders for troops to get it3 con
tingent in position for the task before it.
General Chaffee reported to the depart
ment formally to-day from Nagasaki and
there received the orders which have
been Bent by cable since his departure
from San Francisco. An idea of their
general character can be gathered from
the general's report that he was about
to push forward at once with his big
transport for Taku. He will not even
Â«top at Chefu and it is even doubtful
whether he will detain the Grant at
Nagasaki long enough to take on coal.
He Is energetically taking steps In ad
vance to meet the evil of which the for
eign naval commanders have complaii.ed,
but none have remediedâ the lack of
landing facilities at Taku. To this end
he has Instructed Lieutenant Colonel
Coolidge of the Ninth Infantry at Tient
sin, to secure at once all of the tups and
lighters necessary to a speedy landing of
the reinforcements and stores' that .are
being carried by the. Grant.
Chinese Escort Not Wanted. "
In spite of the alarm with which the
Chinese officials, Including Li Hung
Chang, prefer to view the advance of the
allied forces on Peking, so far'as It affects
the safety of the foreign Ministers, It may
be said that none of the powers have
evinced any tendency to abate their prep
arations or accept an escort-of Imperial
troops for the Ministers from Peking to
Tientsin. This Government has acted all
the while on the theory that the Ministers
were alive and has accepted in good faith
the assurances of the Chinese . Govern
ment to this effect, but It has not reeog
nized In any way the suggestion contained
In Cheng's cable of yesterday that the
Chinese Government should furnish the
foreigners an escort out of Peking 1 . It
was said at the State Department to-day
that the American Minister Is not to be
delivered up by a force of Chinese troops
to the allied forces or to any one else.
This Government deems it much more ap
propriate. If he needs an escort out of
Peking, that It should be composed of
American soldiers.

DeCartier Is secretary of the Belgian
legation at Pekins.
Bears Date of July 4 and Is Believed to
Have Been Written at the Time His
Recent Message Was Filed.
Europeans here understand thoroughly the last part of this edict, which states that Viceroys and Governors are comman
ed by the Dowager Empress to prepare for a Chinese war against the allied forces. Viceroy Taksu is bitterly anti-foreign and is
increasing his armaments, military and marine. His plans will be unmasked soon after the allied powers ascertain definitely the
facts concerning the massacre in Peking, which are being sedulously concealed.

NO HOPE FOR FOREIGNERS IN THE LEGATIONS.
LONDON, . July 26 i - r The Daily Mail publishes this dispatch Jr.om its special correspondent:
'â¢Shanghai. !Â¦ "Wednesday (urgent)â I have received furtnerinfofmation from' a naflvc employe who escaped from Peking
to Niuchwang. He states that when he left Peking a majority of persons in the British legation were dead and the condition of
the living was hopeless. This witness, who was an interpreter and writer at the British legation, states that Sir Robert Hart died
on July 2.
"No other dates are. given in the message from Miu Chwarig. The leading Chinese newspaper here published yesterday
a dispatch declaring that it was all over with the members of the legations. The president of a minor board at Peking wrote to
a relative in Shanghai under date of July 9, saving: â¢ â¢
" 'The foreign legations are still uncaptured, but owing to the daily fighting it is rumored that only about 300 persons are
left alive in the legations, and if there is any delay in the arrival of the relief force I fear that none will be left to receive it/
"This letter is regarded in Shanghai as authentic. Strange enough it says nothing of any assistance to the legations by
Prince Ching or General Lung Lu."
RUSSIAN FORCE MAY HAVE BEEN ANNIHILATED.
ST. PETERSBURG. July 25. â In the opinion of the Russian General Staff, the protective force on the railway between
Charbin and Tijien must be in a critical position, since no definite news of the situation there has been received. All that is known
is that the wives and children of the workmen have fled to Charbin.
The detachment, which numbers 200. was at the end of June threatened by 15.000 Chinese, with artillery. As late as Julv
17 it had not been heard of either at Charbin or Sungari, and it is feared that the force has been annihilated.
Colonel Artamonoff. of the Russian General Staff, a well known traveler, has been ordered to proceed to Kwangtung
and then to place himself at the disposal of the Governor of Port Arthur.
General Sacharoff, Chief of the Russian Gendral Staff, wires under date of July 24, from Mikhailo, in the Semenovskaya dis
trict: .
"I am advancing. To-day we bombarded the fortified post at Lauschi. The garrison fled, and the post was burned, and its
walls destroyed."
"We are trying our utmost to preserve the lives of the other Ministers. They are still in safety. For fear that the
Viceroys and Governors may misunderstand the intention of this decree and rely on the safety of these Ministers as a
ground for making peace, let themâtaking no need whateverâ prepare for attack and defense. Neglect in fortifying the
districts under their jurisdiction will bring endless calamity. The Viceroys and Governors are to pay all their attention to
and urge on pre'parations for coast attack and defense. They are. to take the consequences in case of any territory being
entirely lost through their delay or mismanagement."
"We have lost Tientsin. Great precautions have been taken in Peking. No peace can be obtained without going through
war.
"In the time of Chungoow the agreement is made that no murder can be committed on Ministers from abroad. It is a
month since the Minister from Germany was assassinated by the Boxers. Strict orders have been given to arrest the mur
derer.

THE CALL'S SUHMARY OF
NEWS FROM THE FAR EAST
AT last the veil over Peking seems to be lifting. A native employe of the British legation who
escaped from the capital to Niuchwang states that when he leftâ on what date in July is not
specified â a majority of the foreigners in the legation were dead, and the condition of the
living was hopeless. According to a letter from a minor official in Peking, of the date of July 9,
received in Shanghai, only three hundred of the besieged remained alive and attacks upon the
legation were being continued.
That a general massacre would follow the fall of the legation was the fear expressed by
Minister Ccnger in a. dispatch of July 4 received in Washington yesterday. The siege had then
lasted two weeks, and the Chinese soldiery who constituted the sole government of the city were
determined to massacre all foreigners.
Tha Imperial Government is unable to longer conceal the fact that it is preparing for a
war aqainst the civilized world.

COMMUNICATION
IS RESTORED BY
LORD ROBERTS
Mr. A. J. Balfour, First Lord of , the
Treasury and Government leader in the
House, moved the closure, which was
carriedâ 169 ayes to 100 noes. The motion
on reduction of Mr. Chamberlain's salary
was then lostâ 20S noes to 52 ayesâ and the
Colonial Office vote was agreed to.
The opposition did not spare Mr. Cham
berlain. Liberal members sharply Inter
rupted him and charged him with mis-
Quottng other speakers and reminded him
that the whole history of South Africa in
the past seven year? had furnished sub
stantial ground for him to be suspected
in all his actions.
Mr. Chamberlain charged thÂ« Radicals
Â¦with condoning rebellion. The policy of
th<Â» Government, he declared, however,
wns not vindictive, and instead of sub
jecting the rebels to the death penalty or
imprisonment, it only proposed to disarm
them politically for ten years. . -'
Mr. Chamberlain, replying, welcomed
the issue raised by the motion, Â¦which, he
declared, meant that the war was. wrong,
and that, consequently, annexation of the
South African republics was wrong and
thHr independence should be restored to
them. In his opinion, however, the war
was just and righteous, and should not
bo judged by the consequences In loss of
life. John Bright had defended the Civil
War in America as .lust and righteous,
although the loss of life was as thousands
to units as compared with South Africa.
LONDON, July 25.â Discussion of the
Colonial Office vote led to a spirited de
bate in the House of Commons to-day, in
the course of which the Liberals again
aired most of the old charges against the
Colonial Secretary, Mr. Joseph Chamber-
Iain, and indulged in criticisms of the
South African war. Finally Sir Wilfrid
Lawson moved a reduction of Mr. Cham
berlain's salary as a mark of censure of
his policy.

There appears to bo a difficulty, owing

The Government dispatches block the
available wires and little .private news
comes through. Nevertheless, there* are
rumors that the situation is more serious
than it is officially represented to be, and
that the Russians Have been driven back
while trying to save the southern por

Russian concentration there and are now
trying to smash communication between
Port Arthur and Nluchang. Tho critical
situation has forced the Russians to with

transport to Taku by the volunteer fleet.
"Much valued time Is wasted by the

ing big struggle comes also the
news of disagreements between the
powers and the foreign comman
ders, which threaten to hamper united ac
tion and to encourage Chinese resistance.
A conference of the admirals at Taku,
called to settle the question regarding the
management of the restored railway, de
cided in favor of Russian control, only

TIENTSIN*. July 21. via Shanghai.
July 25.â To-day's performance will
break the backbone of the Chinese
war party. At daylight this morn
ing the combined forces turned
their attack upon the Chinese left, which
was penetrated. As the Russians failed
to. make a suitable bridge across the
canal, the Chinese made a smart counter
attack on our right and left outposts.
This was repulsed by a handful or two
of men. who fought with great bravery.
i but^ with heavy casualties. No Amer
ican was injured.
At 1 o'clock In the afternoon the allies
bombarded the native city and after an
hour of magnificent work fcy two four
inch guns and three twelve-pounders the
fort and adjoining military pagodas were
in tiamep. Their destruction was com
plete. The fort replied feebly with a few
rounds, when one gun got the exact
range and fired several lyddite shells.
This is the fort that has been shelling
Tientsin since June 17.
The allied forces have spared the por
tions of the native city from which oper
ations have not been directed.
Chinese Soldiers Slay Boxers.
Chinese coming in from the country re
port that the Chinese soldiers are killing
the Boxers wherever the latter are seen,
giving as a reason that the Boxers de
ceived them into embarking on a hopeless
struggle. An intelligent Chinese said he
regarded this as a sign of widespread dis
'sension. It was only a matter of a short
time, he declared, before the same state
would exist in Peking, when, in all prob
ability, Ying Lu, commander in chief cf
the Chinese forces, and Prince Ching
would be able to regain sufficient influ
ence to make peace, especially if the for
eigners in the capital were safe. ThlsÂ»
appears to represent the general native
opinion here as far as it is possible to
ascertain it.
Colonel Boer of the French regiment.
Colonel YVogack of the Russians and Cot
onel Aoki of the Japanese will form. the
joint provisional government for the city
of Tientsin which it was recently de
cided to establish. They will be entrust
ed with thfÂ» task of bringing something
like order out of the pxistlng chaos.
Since the issue of the proclamation in
viting well-disposed Chinese to return to
their homes a number have come hack
to tlie city, and many native servants are
coming to the settlements, a majority of
them returning to the service of their
previous employers.
The native city presents an appalling
spectacle o* ruin and desolation. The
suburbs wer? completely destroyed by
flre, mostly caused by the shells of the
allies on tha side facing the settlements.
It Is believed that not a dozen houses are
intact, and the wall was damaged by the
tremendous flre of the allies' artillery,
which, however, was apparently not
heavy enough to produce much effect. A
curious spectacle is presented by a num
ber of mud hovels immediately under.
neath the wall where the latter was most
damaged, hardly one of them showing
signs of having been hit.
Littered With Chinese Dead.
Tnsirle the city the damage was terrific.
The buildings nearest the wall* were
ruined by flre and many were totally
blown to pieces by the shells of the allies.
Among the smoldering ruins are many
charred corpses.
The allies are busy removing the bodies,
but. in consequence of the great number
of dead, many have not yet been buried
The streets throughout the city are gtrâ^Â»n
with all kinds of articles, and coiens
of Chinese are digging in the ruins .iur I
money and other valuables.
Most of the houses which ore intact or
little damage.1 display the flags of one
or the other of the allied forces, the Jap
anese and French flags predominating.
There have been many attempts to imi
tato the flags, which, under other circum
stances, would be laughable. The houses
which do not display flags show bits of
cotton or paper bearing the names of the
allied nations and complimentary sen
tences. The French, apparently, are the
favorites, many of the pieces of cotton
and paper displayed bearing the Inscrip
tion "France" or Vive la France." All
are unmistakably in the hardwritingof

natics Who Drew Them Into

t native clerks formerly employed by for
eign Chinese firms.
i It Is stated that the Chinese losses since
the troubles broke out are 11.000. most of
whom have been killed by Boxers and sol
diers. This i3 profcably much exaggerated.
Tribute to American Valor.
General Dorward. the British com
mander, has sent to the American com
mander a letter in which he says:
I desire to express the high appreciation of
the British tro< jÂ»= of the honor done them la
serx-ln^ alongside thÂ»!r comrades in the Amert
c-Â»n army and cf the high honor accorded me ta
having them under my command.
I blame myself for the mistake made in
taking their position by the NliHh Regiment,
not remembering that troops fresh to the scene
of action and hurried forward in the excite
ment of attack were likely to lose their way.
Still the position they took and gallantly stuck
to a!l day undoubtedly prevented a large body
or the enemy fr'.m tumlnar the right of the.
attacking force and lnfllctirx serious loss on
the French and Japanese. Â»
General Dorward also expressed h!Â«
sympathy with the Americans in the loss
of Colonel Liacum. commander of the
regiment, and Captain Davis of the Ma
rin<Â» Corps. He commended Lieutenant
Butler and Lieutenant Leonard ot the
Marine Corps, and Lieutenant Lawton of
the repiment, and praised Lieutenant Col
onel Coolldse for his skillful management
of the regiment.
Chinamen from the walled city describe
a reijm of terror inaugurated by thÂ»
Boxers before the city fell. The Boxera
killed all Chinese who had been In tho
employ of Europeans, holding a daily in
quisition. They decapitated even thosÂ»
suspected of friendship for foreigners or
of adopting foreign customs. The mere
wearing of .narrow sleeves was deemed
an offense justifying the death of the of
fender and the confiscation of his prop
erty.

! T.n partMn the action. Many foreigners were
| afforded shelter ar.d protection during the night,
i A copy of the report of the commanding of-
I fleer cf the Monocacy 1? herewith inclosed.
j .The vessels, except the lit!?, took their as
i sjRr.ed pc sitlons early in tlie evening of the
] 16th irst., and about U:S5 a. m., one hour be
; fore the expiration of the time limit, all the
J fnrts' guns which could be trained on the
j ships fired simultaneously, many shots striking
, the Koreetx. The vessels returned the flre with
i a rapid fire from their cur.s. which, with, the
, exception of the guns nf six-inch caliber, were
I of small rapid-fire type.
The guns on the North Fort were chiefly 4.7
i inch, while the South Fort has a number of
I guns from 6 to S inches caliber.
The Algerlre. having aboard a landing party
of some 380 men. immediately put thÂ»in ashore.
A portion of them advanced through Taku to

Fame and Whiting, took them to Tonsku.

of the Enslish, aggregating some twO men,
awaiting an opportune time for the assault.

| to take water and burning forty-seven men
i more or IeÂ«s severely. She got over an awning
! "as a collision mat) and after a few hours'
! work was floating at her normal height.
Capture of the Forts.
At about 5 a. m. the gunboats having silenced
the Northwest Fort, a landing force charged
I and captured It. While hoisting the flag, casual
; ties occurred, notably the captain of the Japa-
I ne.Â«e landing party and one- English sailor
i killed and several wounded. The Chinese then
i abandoned th? N'orth Koit. which is Joined to
N- Tthwest Fcrt by a protected passage. After
; about two hours more the South Forts Were
; taken, after the explosion of the magazine,
i Most of the fx-cupants fled, but were net pur
j Fiir-d. Pome thirty or forty were found hiding
| in various :>arts of th<? fort. The several na
i tinns participating hoisted their flags on the
i various flags-taffs. The f,-rts b?!ni? of thick mud
j and grass a.dobe, were but little damaged by
] the gunfire, although they received a host ot
projectiles. The gun* and sunshields as a rule
| were not damaged. Two or three cf the mod
'Â¦ ern guns were disabled.
I The dead Chinese were not counted, but it Is
j estimated hy eye-witnesses that some 200 dead
! were left in the forts. The loss on the side
| of the allied forces was as nearly as possible
' as follows:
j Algr-rineâ One officer badly injured, eight men
wounded. Iltisâ Captain badly Injured, three
cr four men killed, six cr eight wounded
Kernr-Ptzâ Two officers badly wounded, eight
men dead, twelve wounded. Gullakâ One officer '
badly wounded, eight men killed, ten wounded, I
forty-sevrn burned by explosion of "powder
room." I.Ionâ One man killed, one badly wound
ed. Other vessels engaged, injuries of minor
Importance.
The above is an account gleaned with con
versations of officers engaged, but may con
tain minor inaccuracies.
During the engacement guns were turned on
the Monocacy, which was out of the line of
fire. She was struck (no casualties) and was
forced to withdraw up the river. Very re
spectfully. IXHTIR KEMPFF,

IT. l*>oo.â Sir: I would state what follows Is
â¢in regard to the happenings previous to the

2. On Thursday, June 14, Kear Admiral Bruce
called nnd psked what I thought of the mat
ter, crd 1 informed him that I was not au
tborised to initiate any act of war with a
country with trhich my country was at peace;
that my limit was to protect American interests
lÂ»oth by regulations and under recent instructions
from lÂ»uth the department ar.d from the com
:nar.0er in chief cf the United States naval

3. On the J.".th at a consultation of thÂ«- other

yesterday noon. I attended a meetinK of offi
cers at *> p. m. on board the Rorbora. I wao
shown the protocol and ultimatum as to the
Taku forts. The signatures to the document
were autographic, and as yours was not ap
pended 1 informed the senior officer that lie
would have to leave the Monocacy out of thf
plans and places for the vessels of the at
tacking forces.
2. The first pun was flred at 12:45 a. m.. and
with the Ftmultaneotis discharge that followed
two of the shots passed over the Monocacy,
although she was out of the line of fire be
tween the forts nnd vessels attacking.
3. The Iltis did not leave her berth, whlcli
woe a short distance from mine, until 12:30.
and the Japanese did not leave her's during
the boinbardmt?nt.
4. The flre was well sustained on both sides,
and although shells continued at intervals to
it to a wide flrins by the forts'. About 2:30
1 was standing on top of the pilot-house, by
the GatlJng I had mounted there, when I
luanl a shell approaching and immediately
hfnrd a. crash. The second cutter, hanging at
her ilavlts a few feet below and behind me,
hnd been struck by a shell. It had entered
her stern, torÂ» out the bottom and rangln.,'
diagonally across the ship, causing the fall
of the steam launch, smafhlng port forecastle
ladder and passed through the ship's side, in
which it left a clear cut over all two feet iÂ»y
ten Inches. There were many men on the for
ward main deck and it must have fconÂ«* a.-;
close to some of them as it did to me. It
fortunately missed the launch's davit, as that
would have caused It to explode.
5. It was difficult to make out how the allies
were farins. but they were evidently closing, as
after 3 a. m. discharges from guns like Gat
llngs or Maxims were heard. At 4 o'clock
there was a tremendous explosion, which I at
tributed to a magazine in one of the forts.
Steamed Out of Range.
fi. Toward 4 o'clock the bursting of shells In
my near vicinity increased to such an extent
that It occurred to me that the forts might be.
directing some of the fire on the railroad sta
tion, as in this flat country it was a prominent
mark, and a number of Japanese and Russian
troops were encamped around it. In such case
the Mnnocacy would be in considerable danger
from fire which I had hitherto considered bad
shooting. Acting upon the thought. I at once
cast off everything. 1 steamed away from the
bank and went two miles up the river, an
choring: In the first hend. This move was
made at 4:20. and at 5:30. the fire slackening
and a Japanese flag floating over one of the
forts. I rettirtied to my berth.
7. I was able to render the following assist
ance: First, a party of thirty-seven ladles and
fhlldren, refugees from the mission at Taku
had fled hurriedly on the notification of the
bombardment. They came aboard last night at
9 o'clock and are still with me. Also came two
officers of H. M. S. Darfieur, who 'had come
flown from Tientsin too late to get to any
Knelish ship. Aa I was coming down the river
at fi a. m. I mot an English torpedo-boat tow
ing a rhinese boat prize. I had no small boat
to make a landing, so I sent the launch to run
her line ashorp. for which thanks have been
returned. I have taken on board and had
stireicnl attendance for the following: A
Japanese soldier with a gunshot wound, a
Chinese coolie found close to the ship with
arm torn oft hy fragment of shell, a Russian
soldier with wound In the hand.
S. Taku forts deserted by every one. No
trains: no telegraphic communication from
anywhere; but I had a telephone from Mr.
rettlnplll, which reports all quiet since first
disturbance.
9. I know nothing of the fight except that the
forts were taken. I feel a natural regret,
shared, no doubt, hy the officers that duty and
orders prevented tho old Monocacy from giving
her ancient smooth-bores a la*t chance. Very
respectfully, â¢ F. M. WISE,

It is believed that three men. three

American Presbyterian Board's mission
at Nodoa. Hainan, have been murdered by
Chinese imperial troops. The last news
from there was on July 12. at which time
they repelled an attack of Boxers.. /%

LOS ANGELES, July 25.â The forest
fire in San Gabriel Canyon has got aÂ» fresh
start. The guests at Sturtevant's Camp
are prepared to move at any "moment.
It Is feared by the forest rangers that
It will be impossible to save the camp,
as the fire is slowly eating Its way in
that vicinity. The camp is. however, sur
rounded by wide trails and the entire
force of fire fighters, which now numbers
about seventy men, will do all in their
power to save the camp.
Supervisor Longdon left to-night for the
scene of the mountain lire. Although on
the Government land, the district comes
within that covered by the Supervisors.
Mr. Longdon, although he does not pro
fess to be a practical mountaineer, thinks
the idea .of the Government to cut wide
trails through the mountains is the best
safeguard against fire that can be sug
gested.
District Attorney Rives thinks there are
laws enough now to reach the starters
of fires, but the trouble lies in the fact
that after the fire has been started
the time to bring the laws into effect
is too late, as tho mischief has then been
done. .

FLAMES AGAIN RAGE
IN SAN GABRIEL CANYON
The Indians this morning held a mass
meeting. They threatened to kill all the
Japanese, who outnumber them twenty to
one.
The police patrol steamers were out all
day with the Japanese fleet and reported
to-night that there did not appear. to b*
a 6lngle case of interference. The Jap
anese are said to be quarreling among
themselves. It is reported from white
fishermen's pources that they went out
yesterday morning on false pretenses with
the sole object of breaking up the strike.
They say that Okal. the principal Jap
anese contractor, was bought over by the
canners, and he promised his countrymen
that if they went out the whites would
follow. The result Is that a score of Jap
anese boats which came in to-day stayed
In and hung up their nets to dry. They
wished to do what the white fishermen
did. The report i3 probably exaggerated.
Three hundred fishermen strikers came
in this morning to Vancouver from Ste
veston to attend the trial of Frank Rog
ers, vice president Of the union, accused
of intimidation. Rogers was arrested
three days ago and was out on bail of
$1OÂ». The crown feared that a convic
tion would lead to a riot, and bo the
charge was withdrawn on the expressed
stipulation that "It may be brought up
later when the present difficulties are
over." That was at noon to-day and Rog
ers was in Stevestort speaking at the
meetings at 3 o'clock. His counsel urged
that the case be gone- on with, but a bench
of three magistrates agreed to the with
drawal.
This afternoon the largest hall in the
town waa rented for a mass-meeting bv
the strikers. It cannot hold more than Z'*3
people, and three separate meetings were
held. Three hundred men filed in at a
time, and every one was pledged to keeD
secret the proceedings.
To-day Colonel Worsnon. the officer
commanding the military detachment at
Steveston. sent in for tents and blankets
His officers have no hesitation in statinij
that they look for trouble before the mat
ter is settled.
It is openly asserted that an attempt
will be made during the next twenty-four
hours by the strikers to take away the
arms of the militiamen. The suggested
proposition is that this would be easv of
accomplishment in the darkness "The
white men sav they have nothing to eat
save what Is subscribed by outside
unions, and believe that if the strike lasts
many more days their men will go to their
homes.
VANCOUVER. B. C. July S.-Desplte
the fact that statements have been made
that fighting would not occur as a result
of the ftshermen"s strike, the condition of
things at the present moment in Stevo
ston is exceedingly serious. The calling
out of the militia, "to protect the Japa
nese against the white men and help
them to take our river from us,"' as the
strikers put it. has caused the bitter feel
ing to grow more intense, and the Queen's
uniform is now openly Insulted on the

There does not exist In Jackson a case
of emallpox that is causing uneasiness
It is not spreading here and it has not
been spread from here to any adjoining
town. While the efforts of our officers
to stamp out the disease are costing the
county many thousands of dollars. thÂ«?lr
efforts will not be relaxed until the last
house has been disinfected after all pa
tients are released and safe to go about.
Notwithstanding these facts a meeting
has been called for to-night at Sutter
Creek to take steps toward quarantining
against Jackson, but the wagon is sent
here every day from the steam laundry
at that place. Di.Â«trict Attorney Viclni
was told by telephone this evening that
the people of Sutter. as a rule, would not
participate in the meeting. Dr. Endicott
the health officer, is out of town and
cannot be seen to-night, but in all mat
ters bearing en the present unforturrate
situation he is in perfect harmony with
the District Attorney and a committee of
prominent citizens appointed recently to
act la the matter.
The disease got the start of our physi
cians at first because of its mild form, and
there were some twenty cases supposed
to be measles. As eoon as it was discov
ered to be varioloid a strong quarantine
was put on every house even suspected of
containing a case. The manner of quar
antine has since been changed, and seven
mounted men are patrolling the town.
Occupants of Infected houses are not per
mitted off the premises and no visitors
are admitted. Four houses have had the
quarantine raised after being thoroughly
disinfected, the patients having fully re
covered. But one death has resulted di
rectly from the disease and all remaining
cases are deemed of trifling importance
even by the patients themselves.

The trail followed yesterday led from
the scene of the shooting in Two Rock
Valley, about two hundred vards over
the Matin County line, and ft indicated
that Kin^ is traveling south and bv
night. . His footprints showed plainly in
the heavy dust and he did not pick the
easy places as a man naturally would in
traveling- in daytime. There is little
doubt but that the tracks were Ming's.
The marks were these of a new nalr of
shoes, such as Mrs. King says her hus~
band was wearing, and one footprint ap
peared lig-hter than the other, the fugi
tive's lame leg- evidently bothering- him.
The officers have given up the opinion,
at first held, that King would give him
self up. His wife stated that such was his
intention when she left him and drove
to this city on Monday afternoon. How
King is subsisting is not known, unless it
is on the fruit of the orchards throueh
which he is probably passing-. His wife
can be rendering- him no assistance, for
she is being watched closely by the offi

that he woulG attempt to see his wife,

NEW YORK. July 25.-Charlcs Hale
Hoyt, actor, manager; politician, capital
ist, bon vlvant, has at laÂ£t been declared
insane. Broken in health from griff over
his wife's death a few years ago and
unbalanced by the strain of overwork in
his profession, he was taken to Hartford
Retreat for the Insane on Tuesday. After
a consultation of experts his condition
was declared critical.
Known through his merry farce come
dies, "A Parlor Match," "A Texas Steer,"
"A Trip to Chinatown" and others, the
playwright's misfortune causes sincere
and deep regret. Uroken down mentally
and physically, that his condition is se
rious, is sadly admitted by those who
knew iiim well.
The death of his wife left a bright en
tertainer without a relative in the world.
He fell ill from acute nervous prostra
tion. Close friends anxiously watched
for him to rally from the effects of his
sorrow. He went to Florida for rest and
lecuperatlon. The future seemed uncer
tain, but there were strong hopes for his
ultimate recovery.
There were many sensational rumors
persistently circulated about the play
wright. It was said he had been eeen
sitting In tho corridors of New York and
Washington hotels asleep with his jaw
harming on his breast, a picture of a men
tally broken down man and the center of
a wondering, pitying crowd; that he walk
ed the streets almU.ssly and almost un
consciously at night, and that when he
sat In a box at Washington Theater,
where his latest farce, "A Dog In the
Manger," was produced, he Imagined he
was in New Haven, and a few days after
ward had no knowledge, that the piece
had been performed anywhere. He went
South and then followed the story of his
removal to an asylum or sanitarium.
Friends have long refused to believe
that Mr. Hoyt needed restraint. He en
joys the freedom of hotels In this city
as well as in the South. He came here
recently from his summer home in
Charlestown, N. II. While on his return
he began sending strange telegrams to
his former associates. "Hoyt is failing."
they told one another. His friends went
to his beautiful country home in New
Hampshire. They tried to comfort him
in his misfortune. They finally sent for
the family physician. Other physicians
came and a long consultation was held.
It was finally declared that the playwright
Is insane.

THE PLAYWRIGHT,
IN AN ASYLUM
SAN JUAN, Porto Rico. July 23. â The
streets of San Juan were a labyrinth of
glittering Spanish flags to-day In honor
of St. Jago, the patron saint of Spain.
Banners and bunting, suspended from
house to house covered the thoroughfares
and everywhere the balconies were richly
decorated.
There was no attempt whatever to dis
play tho American colors. The celebra
tion of the Fourth of July was totally
eclipsed to-day. Then the citizens were
unable to raise a dollar for the purpose
61 tiemens-trations. To-day there was no
difficulty in carrying through "a pro
gramme which must have cost $5fXK). Pos
sibly six native houses displayed the
stars and stripes. On the other hand it
is estimated that no fewer than 2500 Span
ish flags were flung to the breeze.
I.net evening there was a grand concert
in the plaza, attended by COX) Spaninrds,
and this was followed by patriotic ad
drosses, received with great enthusiasm*
at the Casino..
To-day dawned with the ringing of
church bells, followed by street parades.
Business was entirely suspended. An
elaborate ball at the Casino this evening
concluded the festivities.
The real feeling of the people was ex
pressed by bands of hoodlums, who pa
raded the streets in the less respectable
quarters of the city carrying Spanish
flags and shouting "Viva Espanol." Tho
fact that the day was the second anniver
sary of the landing of the United States
troops under General Miles seemed to to
forgotten here. Although at Ponce, May
aguez and other points there were silighc
observances of the anniversary. It : was
apparent that the local celebration had
been carefully arranged to eclipse that (if
the Fourth of July, which was scarcely
observed at all in Porto Rico.
A prominent Porto Rlcan, discussing
the celebration from that point of view
to-day, said:
"Our people should not be blamed by
the Americans for expressing their feel
ings In tills way. The United States con
stitution has not been extended to the
island. The privileges of citizenship have
been denied them. In such circumstances
Porto RIcans cannot appreciate American
Institutions, and naturally would not
observe American holidays. To-day's
celebration, however, was purely Spanish
and many native Porto Ricans did not
participate."

FORT SCOTT. Kans.. July 2o.-At their
convention to-day the Kansas Democracy
surrendered to the demands of Populists,
and thereby made possible the tightest
and most harmonious fusion that has ever
existed in thte State. The Populists had
demanded from the Democrats the ofllce
of Associate Justice in exchange for that
of Attorney General, although the former
office had previously been granted the
Democrats in what was supposed to be an
air-tight agreement. After an all-night
session of the conference committees
the question was left open to be settled
by the Democratic convention at its
gathering to-day.
The State ticket completed by the dif
ferent conventions was tlnally indorsed bv
all three â Democratic, Populist and Silver
Republican. It follows:
Associate Justiceâ David Martin. Popu
list: Governorâ John W; Breldonthal, Pop
ulist; Lieutenant Governorâ A. *M. Har
vey. Populist; Secretary of Stateâ Al>e
Frakes, Democrat; Treasurer â Conway
Marshall, Democrat; Attorney General-
Hugh P. Farrell, Democrat: Superin
tendent of Insuranceâ Webb McNall. Sil
ver Republican; Electors at Large â R. W
Turner, Silver Republican; J. I*. Filtrate',
Democrat; First Districtâ James Faloon
Silver Republican; Second Districtâ J. B.
Goshorn, Democrat; Fifth Districtâ C. P.
Carst onsen. Democrat: Seventh Districtâ
H. J. Hoetzel. Democrat
The platform adopted by the Democrats
demands among other things the creation
by law of a "public tribunal clothed with
all power necessary for the complete and
efficient regulation and control of rail
ways" and legislation for the regulation
of passenger and freight rates Is demand
ed, as well as the appointment of a rail
way auditor, with power to examine the
books and accounts of railways. The
platform refers to Mr. Bryan as the un
conquered hero, the lion of the West."
INDIANAPOLIS. July 25.â By unani
mous vote of the Xatlonal Committee of
the National Democracy this afternoon,
the scheme of fusion with the anti-im
perialistic movement, originating with
the recent maÂ«=s meeting at the Plaza
Hotel in New York, was defeated, as was
also the plan to place a Gold Democratic
ticket in the field this year.
Of the members of the national com
mittee, there were present nineteen, two
of the committeemen holding several prox
ies. The hour of 4 p. rn. had been ap
pointed for the conference with the Plaza
H^tel committee and at that hour the
latter committee made its appearance and
a sub-cimmittee presented an address
setting out the proposition for fusion and
a third party ticket with the reasons
coming down from the New York meet
ing.
Eastern and "Western , men opposed the
proposition, taking the pround that there
had been disaffections and withdrawals
from the ranks of the National Democ
racy; that the placing of a third ticket in
the field this year with the new issues
now before the country would In no way
tend to an .accomplishment of the end and
aim back of the organization of the na
tional Democratic party in 1W6. It was
urged that those Gold Democrats who
stand to-day where they stood in the
campaign of ISM on the money question
and against "Bryanism" would be left
free to vote in support of the Republican
platform, which was unchangeably in
favor of a sound and stable money sys
tem.
When it came to Mr. "VW D. Tlaldeman,
proprietor of the Louisville Courier-Jour
nal, a sensation was sprung. Mr. Halde
man. In 1J>!>6. contributed valuable aid in
actively raising funds for the organiza
tion and maintenance of the work of the
Gold Democracy and was a member of
the auditing committee of that party.
"When he had concluded he withdrew
from the room. In the course of his
Â£ pooch he said:
In IS9S I took upon myself abundant abuse
from Kentucky Democrats and I did It be
cause I believed, with my friend Henry Watter-
Fon, in the righteousness of a refusal to com
promise with dishonor on the question of a
sound ami stable currency. The free and un
limited coinage of silver and gold at the ratio
of 16 to 1. without the consent of any other
nation, has been relegated to another (fenera
tlnn by this nation. It Is a past measure.
My heart goes out to those who struggle for
liberty In every nation, and I applaud and
ai'prove the exj>resniin in the Democratic |lat
form sympathizing with the Boers. I am com
pelled, with a sense of what |js due to free
America that I love, .to earnestly, actively sup
port 'an American whom I believe ' loves hip

twst type of the American citizen, and thus
believir.q-. I j*hall vote for and support William
Jtnnlnes Dryun.
The committee appointed at the confer
ence held in the Plaza Hotel, New York,
called a maas convention to be held in this
city August 10 to 14, at which a President
and Vice President will be nominated on
the following platform:
Independence and protection to the In

city. The Government's cause, the passenger said. Is hopeless.

HEAVY FIGHTING
AROUND PANAMA
WASHINGTON. July 25.â The
Postmaster General has made
jrublic the report of Fourth
Assistant Postmaster General
Bristow, who investigated the
Cuban postal frauds. Mr. Bristow finds
that Neeiy's embezzlements a^gresrated
et least $131,713 and says he was Justified
in recommending: the removal of Director
General Rathbone. Whether or not the
latter was guilty with Xeely, he says,
there can be no doubt that In the matter
if unauthorized per diem allowances, per
sonal expenses and warrants cashed and
unaccounted for. he unlawfully appro
priated to his own use tho money of the
United States. For this. Mr. Bristow
pays he believes Mr. Rathbone should bÂ©
rt^quired to answer.
Mr. Bristow explains that the bureau j
of finance inaugurated by Director Gc-n
tral Rathbone. of which Noely was ap- j
pointed chief, was started July 7. 1S33. j
This bureau was charged with the cus
tody of all stamps and postal supplies.
The division of jostal accounts, changed
July 1, 1899, to a division of the Auditor's
office, was in charge of Dr. W. H.
Reeves, who was appointed by the Secre
tary of War. The report says that no
accounts of the unbonded postmaster
were required, remittance being entered
as cash Bales, and the only information
the Auditor's office had of these trans
actions came from Neely himself. There
vii no ciiÂ«*ck whatever on his transac
tors. From the accounts examined the
report says the minimum of Neeiy's cm
bezztementa may U- summarized as fol
lows:
Shortage as shown by his own records.
TTAfi *>; excess of credit by destruction of
Ft:rcharped stamps definitely ascertained,
Sini.m; total. 1131.713.
This will be Increased by the discovery
cf sales of fur^harped stamps, but wil!
not exceed JK.iJ.OO0 in tho abrogate.
The report says that Kathhone ap
pointed JCeeljr. who had custody of tlift
stamps; Reeves, the only man who could
have a check on Nocly's transactions, and
D. Warfield. chief of the bureau of regis
tration, a commission to destroy the sur
charged stamps. <>f which Net-ly had J.J2,
000, and that Nrcly and Reeves cnterea
Into a conspiracy to r< port a larger quan
tity of Ftrimps destroyed than were ac
tually destroyed.
But, the report Fays. Neeiy's fraudu
lent transactions were not coritf.ed to
these embezzlements, and wha'. 1 the
p. mounts were small, compared \Jfih the
latter, "thev show the same official de
pravity and" utter disregard of the In
terests of the public service."
Mr. IJr'stow submits evidence that
Neeiy's theft* began a month after he
went to Cuba.
The report says that C. M. Rich, who
was brought to Havana as Neeiy's as
sistant, told Mr. Rathbone that Nee'.y
was "crcx>kf-d." RathlÂ»one den'ed any
puch information. The report says:
Rich claims to be innocent, but he at least
tad knowledge of Xeely'e nnbÂ«-zzl-m*>nts long
before he rlalms tr> havÂ» t"l"1 Itathbone.

Jor crweallntr the fraud tn the Obstruction of
the stamps. Both Klch (ind Reeves protest
against any criminal designs. How much credit
Ffrouid h*- given tn their statements it is dif
ficult to determine.
Rathbone claimed that it was the cus
tom of all countries that officials should
lie furnished with attendants and ths.t
they Fhould be clothed at the expense of
thÂ«>" public revenues. When the character
OFFICIAL REPORT ON NEELT'S
CUBAN POSTAL PECULATIONS
"I have to-day, for the first time, seen
certain of your bills as Director General
of Posts, which were brought here by
< 'clone! Burton. Some of these bills are
not only without authority or Justification,
but an* scandalous and never should haw
been passed or paid. Thp auditor, who is
responsible to a different department, waa
inexcusable in allowing thorn, and your
action in presenting them for allowance
was grossly reprehensible. Without wait
ing for a review and reconsideration of

of these purchases by him became known
to the Postmaster General the latter
wrote to Director General Rathbone as
follows:
CALL BUREAU. WELLINGTON HOTEL. WASHINGTON, July 25.â Tho
visit cf Governor General Wood of Culia to Washington had one object
which the authorities dM not care to disclose. He came to report person
ally upon another scandal which 1b hanRinp over tho military povern
ment In Havana. This time It Is the engineers' department which is the
nest of fraud and corruption.
ThÂ«Â» general charge was made in Havana papers several weeks aero that an
investigation of the enflnwrs" department would lead to discoveries of dishonest
practices and fraudulent contract?. This* charge was met by an assertion from
Colonel William M. Black, chief of the onpinoen*. that he challenged an Investi
gation of his department. In response to this charge and challenge definite and
ppe^irtc charpes of FteRlinjf In the dr-part merit were made to General Wood. A
preliminary investigation, it Is asserted, showed that the charges were true.
This fact was on the point of becoming public, when it was decided to make
a. determined effort to hush up the scandal. One contractor was sent for and
ordered to make restitution of the amount of an over-payment, which was so
transparent that no trick of bookkeeping would cover it. This was done the
day before General Wood left Havana. The amount of this restitution, which
was made directly to the engineers' department, -was not large, amounting to
less than $1000, but the facts connected with the original over-payment are
declared to show pros* negligence, or worse.
This contractor has been doing business with the department for many
month*, practically ever since American control in Cuba began, and his oppor
tunities have been great. His accounts will bo subjected to a careful Inspection.
The accounts of the entire department ar* undergoing secret investigation by ex
perts. It is the Intention to secure restitution of all fraudulent payments that
have been made.

she said that a Grass Valley physician,

not help saying something. If one say but
'here was a good woman' orle has said
a great deal and perhaps said enough.
We all know that in any good^ life the
greater part remains untold. At the end
of the account of the Master's life the
writer of the Gospel says there were also
many other things that Jesus did, but it
would take many volumes to narrate his
d^eds. This is true of every true life. It
is not what the world says or what the
dear friends sayâ it is something else, it Is
the unwritten part that counts. It is not
onlv the prayer he says with his lips, but
it Is the life he leads in his heart: the fel
lowship he shows for fellow menâ that is
the test of your religion. There is much
profession of religion in these days. God
grant there be more of the real thing
Â«ome day. It is not found within. It Is
not what a man says or what he does; it
la what he is. and back of that is found
what he is trying to be that counts. I
will not tell you what this woman has
done in this community, because you
know. Let us pray."
Dr. Leavitt then offered up prayer for
the soldiers, the firemen, the police and
members of the press. Another hymn x>y

The funeral cortege moved slowly

rendered "Good Night, I Am Going

service. The services concluded with the
singing of "Farewell."
It has not been definitely settled

The last rites over the body were solemn
In the extreme and were witnessed by
the immediate relatives, friends and
distinguished men who followed the body
to Its temporary resting place. The serv

the expressed wish of the dead woman
that she be given a private burial, thou

good she had done would have followed
her to the grave.
That her noble deeds in behalf of the
soldiers and the firemen were appreciated
by those two important bodies was evi

William R. Shatter, Lieutenant Johnson
and four soldiers, who acted as honorary
and active pallbearers, and members of

also expressed Us high appreciation of the
dead woman by sending a beautiful floral

present and met his niece for the first
time In thirty years. The meeting was
not an affectionate one, simply a hand
clasp and a "pleased to meet you." Mr.
Coburn was accompanied by his sons, I.
W., Forrest. Martin and Charles. The
father and sons were permitted to view
the remains and were given a carriage to
go "to the burial grounds.
A number of additional floral pieces
were added 'to those already sent and the
room -.wherein the body lay was a bower
of sweet smelling flowers. The handsome
Hag presented to Mrs. Townsend by the
executive committee which arranged the
reception to the returning California
Volunteers covered the magnificent cas
ket. A bunch of Marechal Xeil roses
rested on the flag.
During the services, which were con
ducted by the Rev. Bradford Leavitt of the
First Unitarian Church, Mrs. Murray sat
in an adjoining room and was comforted
by Rev. Charles Ramm of St. Mary's
Cathedral. The Knickerbocker Male
Quartet, composed of H. Williams,
Dr. R. W. Smith, D. B. Crane and L. A.
Larsen, rendered "Abide With Me." and
at the conclusion of the hvmn Dr. Lea
vitt read the burial service. When he
concluded, the quartet sang "Nearer, My
God. to Thee." The minister then read
another chapter of the service and con
cluded by- reading the psalm. "The God of
the living." He then. said In part:

his memory. They will sometimes sit and

recognize that the best that can be said

yesterday afternoon. Several years ago
young Wetjen went across the bay to visit
his aunt. Mrs. Liss. who is camping at
Ross landing. Yesterday afternoon, in
company with his aunt, he went down to
the bathhouses at Tamalpais for a swim.
The little fellow entered the water and
enjoyed himself for some time, swimming
up and clown the creek. He gave no sign
of distress until a cry was heard and he
was seen to struggle for a moment and
sink. He never came up.
Mrs. Liss, who was sitting on the bank,
plunged into the creek, weighted with all
her clothing. In a vain effort to save the
little fellow.
The Rev. Father Reginald Newell, pas
tor of St. Dominick's Church at Bush and
Steiner streets, who was In the vicinity,
hearing the cries for help from the ex
cited people, ran to the bank and plunged
into the creek and commenced a search
for the body. The brave priest. In spite
of the tide and the weight of his drench
ed clothing, continued his search until
he found the body and brought It ashore.
Dr. Cunningham of this city, who was
present, lent his aid in a determined ef
fort to resuscitate the body, assisted by
Dr. W. J. "Wirkrr.ann of San Rafael, but
their efforts were unavailing, as life was
extinct. The body had been submerged
about twenty minutes.
Mrs. I^iss, the aunt, Â¦was hysterical and
prostrated through grief and her violent
exertions in her vain efforts to save her
nephew's life.
The father of the boy was notified at
once and went to San Rafael, to which
place Coroner Eden of Marin County or

Gold Watch and Best Wishes Pre
sented to W. B. Storey Jr. by
Directors.
There was a meeting of the directors of
the Valley road yesterday, but it was for
pleasure, not for business, and the cause
of It was the presentation of a gold watch
to W. B. Storey, the chief engineer ot
the road, who will go East within a few
days to become chief . engineer of the
Santa Fe system.
It was somewhat difficult to gather the
directors and the old friends of Storey to
gether without exciting some suspicion,
but it was done, and th*-n Storey was
called In. Robert Watt made the presen
tation 'speech and everybody extended
good wishes to the departing official. The
Inscription on the watch is: "Presented

Kennedy Demands Injunction En
joining Fire Commissioners From
Awarding Contract to O'Rpurke.
J. F. Kennedy applied to Judge H*b
bard yesterday for an Injunction restrain
ing the Fire Commissioners from award
ing the contract for the shoeing of the
department's horses to Jq,hn O'Rourke.
Kennedy was represented by Herbert
ChoynSki, -who, stated that Kennedy's bid
of Jl 93 for each horse was the lowest.
O'Rourke's bid was $2 for each horse, and
the minutes of the meeting at which the
bids were submitted bear out his state
ment. â¢
Secretary McCarthy of the Com
missioners in answer to Choynski's
questions disclaimed any knowledge
of the facts other than those
read from the minutes. R. J. Harris,
who has charge of the horses, was asked
a lot of technical questions bearing on
the specifications under which the two
rivals submitted bids. Owing to the ab

RIVAL HORSESHOERS
FIGHT OVER CONTRACT
WILLIE LEROY BEAN, a bright
boy S years ot age, was fatally
crushed under the wheels of an
electric car almost In front of
his parents' residence at 332 Tenth street
yestc-rday morning. He was taken. to the
Receiving Hospital In the ambulance, but
Dr. Bunnell, who attended him, saw at
once that he could not live many hours.
His left leg was amputated above the
knee and his right leg was crushed into
pulp. There was also an extensive frac
ture of his skull. He was taken to the
hospital about 10:30 o'clock and died in
about two hours.
Car 703 was going south in charge of
Conductor F. B. Hill and Motorman T.
13. Keed. When It was between Folsom
and Harrison streets the boy, who had
bâ¬Â«^n riding on a milk wagon going
north, jumped off and started across
the street. He ran In tront ol the
car and was knocked down by It. The
rear wheels passed over his legs. Reed
stopped the car as soon as he could and
â¢wttn the aid of the conductor picked the
mangled bov up and carried him to the
sidewalk. The boy's father. Lieutenant
Thomas Bean of Engine Company 29, who
is spending his vacation, had just finished
striving himself when some one called
and told him that something had hap
pened outside. Fearing the worst he
niFhed out of the house and when he saw
the mangled body of his only son he com
pletely brokft down.
"I was with Sweeney that night he met
his death, and It looks to me as if our
company had a hoodoo," said the giief
stricken father.
Reed the motorman, after taking his
car to the house, came to the City Hall
and surrendered himself to Policeman
Conlon. He was booked on a charge of
battery and released on $o0 cash ball.
After the boy died he again surrendered
himself and was booked for man
slaughter, being released on the same
bail "I was not to blame for the acci
dent " said Reed. "The milk wagon was
abreast of the car when the boy jumped
from it and the car struck him like a
flash."

D. E. McEInlaT, "who Is in the Seventh
Ccr.gres5icnal District encaged 5n the
work of organizing ilcKinley and Roose
velt dubs, sends to the Republican State
Central Committee cheering reports of
progress. Many citizens who voted for
Hry&n in U9f are actively advocating the
election of the Republican national ticket
In this campaign. Many large Republican
dubs have been crirar.ized and much en
thusiasm in the cause is shown.
So far the energies of the Republican
State Convention have been chiefly direct
ed to the Tiork of impressing upon voters
the urgent necessity cf early registration.
The law requires every voter to register
at.ew for the general election in Novem
ber. According to official announcement ;
cn^r.a'Jng from the Election Commission- ;
crs of Kan Francisco, registration for the
general election closes Sepieinber 28, forty :
cays prior to November 6. It is true that
;:.-.- Auctxalian ballot law provides that
registration tl.cM close forty days prior
to tli* general election, but the framers
of the law evidently overlooked the con
stitution cf tha Siaie of California. Sec
ricn 1. article XI, of the constitution de
clares:
'Even' native male citizen of the United
Btates, ever)' maie person who shall have
acquired the rights of citizenship under
or by virtue of the treaty of Queretaro
cud every male na.tura!izod citizen thereof. Â¦
Â¦who ehail have bÂ«-cume such ninety days !
prior to any election, of the age of 21 years,
who shail havt- betn a resident of the 1
State one year n^xt preceding the election :
ar.d of the county in which he claims his j
vote r.Im-ty days and in the election pre
etnet thirty days, ; hall be entitled to vote
at all elections which are now or may '
hereafter be authorized by law."
It is acknowledged bv the ailest advis- j
ere of the Republican State Central Com- !
ir.lttee that t!;e provision of the ballot law j
requiring registration to close forty days i
j>rior to the general election Is unconstltii- I
tlonaJ. The law car.r.ot take away from Â¦
the voter a right which the constitution ;
guarantees.
The Election Comrr.'.seicr.ers will not

the political parties win continue to urge I
all voters to pet on the register before I

possessing the quaMrioations set forth In

THE pilots have another whale story

One of the leviathans while out hunting
opened its huge Jaws to take In a mouth
ful of small fish and engulfed the kedge
anchor of the pilot boat. A nuke of the
mud hook must have hurt the mamma!.
for it rose to the surface and started oft
at the rate of about a mile a minute with
the pilot boat in tow. After going about
five knots the kedge line parted and
pilots and crew went down on their knees
and said prayers. Captain Erskine led
the devotions. '
Mondav night the pilot boat Gracie S
was on the outside station and within a
few hundred yards of where the Eontea
was run into by a whale and sunk. Cap
tains Krskine and Kortz were the only
pilots '.eft aboard, the others having
"boarded oft" during the day. No ves
sels were due and there was not a thing

Kortz. The latter was already In bed,
so Erskine decided to follow suit. lie un
flressed himself leisurely and had just
removed his shoes when the Grade S
gave a jump ahead that thr^w him off
his feet.
The shock brought Captain Kortz out

and Krskine were on deck, and then they
saw the cause of their trouble. The
whale was running through the water,
leaving a phosphorescent trail behind it
drapjrlng the pilot boat, which was almost

paring to cut the kedpe line it parted and
when hauled aboard showed that it must
have come right away from the rinp In
the stock of the anchor. The Grade S
cruised all that night and it poes without
sayinp that .lust as bright a lookout was
kept for whales as was kept for ships.
"1 have never in my life seen as many
whales off shore." said Captain Erskine
yesterday. "During the day they can be
seen spouting in every direction and at
night you can hear them breathing all
around you. I'm glad that we escaped
with the loss of a kedge anchor. It might

We are told that Bryan will not take the stump for

as to what is the matter with his jaw.
Lord Kitchener may yet have a chance to stand

make one weary.

CALIFOENIANS IN NEW YORK.
Jerry Simpson's Senatorial aspirations arc now
about ns bare as his feet.' for the Kansas Populists
have everlastingly knocked the socks off them.
The British arc having a hard time catching the
Boers in South Africa, and, moreover, when they do
they generally catch a licking.
The Texas Populists have copyrighted their plat
form to keep the Democrats from stealing it, *o it is
evident they Irave some sense after all.
Get your name on the great register, enroll your
se'f as a member of a Republican club and then vote
right. Those are the three. primary duties of everv
good citizen at this time.
Some Philadelphia folks have organized a society
lo promote an alliance with Great Britain, but no
alarm need be felt on the subject. The thing has no
Evmptozs of over becoming a movement.
DOWN in Texas the Populists have held a con
vention, adopted a platform containing noth
ing about Bryan or imperialism, and appended
to it the declaration: "Whereas, Past experience has
proven that the Populist platforms are tempting to
Democratic politicians; be it therefore Resolved. That
the chairman of the executive committee be hereby
instructed to have the Populist platform copyrighted
before the Democratic convention, August 8."
The declaration shows that the Populists of Texas
are weary of erecting platforms only to see them
stolen by Democrats. It would seem that in this
campaign a platform from which Bryan and im
perialism have been carefully excluded would be safe
from such thefts, but the framers of it are wise i'n
taking no chances. There is no telling wh.nt a Texas
Bryanite will do when he gets started. It would be
just as easy for those fellows to put a Bryan brand
on a harmless platform as it is for a cattle man with
an eye to the main chance to put his brand on any
maverick he finds running around the plains.
When Sir Robert Peel as the leader of the Tory
party in Britain abandoned the policy of protection
and suddenly introduced a free trade bill Disraeli
taunted him with many a jibe for his political dishon
esty. He charged that Peel had "found the Whigs
bathing and stolen their clothes," that he "had ob
tained applause under false pretenses," and "acquired
a party policy by the practice of political petty lar
ceny."
All of which may not have been true of Peel, but is
certainly true of the Bryanites. They have stolen
the clothes of Democracy and the principles of Popu
lism, and they are still on the hunt for anything they
can pick up. The Texas Populists have been prudent
in copyrighting their platform, but if they be really
sagacious they will watc'h it with shotguns.

PERSONAL MENTION.
The Presidential campaign brings up many issues on
which the people are divided, but all can agree upon
the importance of a grand celebration of Admission
day and unite with the Native Sons in trying to make
it worthy of the occasion.
That is all. there is to the problem. William Wal
dorf Astor has his faults, but he is not lackine in a
-
As a rule the uninvited guest is not a welcome guest.
There is a story that a Georgian volunteer during the
Civil War managed to get possession of a chicken,
and. being a man of large hospitality, he invited three
friends to join him for dinner. Just as he had divided
the chicken into four parts and was about to serve
the company in came a stranger. The host served his
three friends, and then looking over to the newcomer
said: "Mr. uninvited guest, perhaps you would like
a piece of chicken?" "I would," replied the guest.
"Well, then," said the host, ''why don't you go and
catch one?"
In all communities there is a class of men who, be
cause of their wealth or their native gall, think they
have a right to go anywhere. They walk into balls
and other social gatherings without invitations and
rely upon the courtesies of society to make the game
go safely through. There is no telling how many of
that kind of lordlings there are in London, nor how
much a rich American who gives entertainments of
note in that capital has to endure from their aristo
cratic nerve. It is quite probable that Mr. Astor has
been annoyed a good many times by Sir this or Sir
that walking into his concerts and receptions without
an invitation, and that at last the thing became unen
durable. '
Now The Call knows nothing of the correctness of
these theories, but it desires to direct attention to the
f?ct that neither of them gives Mr. Astor a fair show.
He has* been condemned without a hearing, and iio
one has reminded the public that he has some rights
in the matter. The facts themselves, freed from the
coloring given by theories, present us with the old
problem of the host and the uninvited guest. It is
universally conceded that a man's house should be^the
chief scene of his hospitality, and that when an ac
quaintance comes to the door he should be invited in
and properly entertained. When a man gives a partv,
however, a different condition of affairs is presented,
and it is not so universally agreed that at such time j
host should be required to welcome every uninvited
guest that comes.
Thus far there have been advanced two theories on
the subject. One is that Astor's conduct was an act
of vulgar rudeness from a purse-proud millionaire,
and that society is going to cut him. The other is a
romantic theory. It sets forth that Sir Berkeley loves
Miss Pauline Astor: that she so far favors his suit as
to invite him to the concert without saying anything
about it to her father: that Mr. Astor objects to, such
a son-in-law, and that the next proceeding in the
affair is to be a duel. "
WILLIAM WALDORF ASTOR gave a con
cert, and Sir Berkeley Milne went to the con
cert without an invitation. Mr. Astor not only
requested the intruder to leave, but next day published
the announcement that Sir Berkeley's presence at the
concert had been uninvited. Over that episode in the
private life of a set of people who are of no use what
ever to the world, there is more discussion and agita
tion in Europe and America than over a thousand
things of a thousand limes more importance.
AN UNINVITED GUEST.

THE AWAKENING.
The programme arranged for the celebration is an
excellent one. The Native Sons have done their
share of the work well. The display of the different
rarlors will constitute one of the best advertisements
of the industries, resources and wraith of the various
cocntirs of the State that has ever been made. Th?
one thing now needed to assure a complete success
:< money, and that should be provided without delay.
Come up with the coin.
Above all matters of individual profit to be ob
tained from increased trade, however, are considera
tions of State and civic patriotism involved -in the
event.. We are so far from the populous States of th^
East that we must be more enterprising than any
other State in order to maintain our rightful prestige
in the Union. We must advertise California and
make her merits known. Every year should see un
dertaken and carried to success some movement
which will attract attention to the varied climate and
marvelous resources of our great commonwealth.
Only by that means cm we draw to the State the en
terprising population and the capital needed to keep
the pace of it= advancing development abreast with
that of the most progressive States of the republic.
It has been estimated that the amount of money
which will be brought to the city will not fall short
of $-?50.ooo. To that must be added a considerable
sum which our f own people would probably take out
of the city on holiday jaunts were not a more attrac
tive celebration prepared for them at home than any
they could expect to find elsewhere. Thus the mone
tary grains to the community arc sure to be large.
and it is plain to be seen that the more splendid and
attractive the festival is made the more visitors will
jt draw from all parts of the country, and the larger
will be the amount of money put into circulation.
Two strong reasons present themselves in favor of
liberal and early contributions. The first is that the
celebration is to be a matter which will attract the
attention of the whole Union and will go far toward
adding to the prestige of the city. The second is that
it will draw thousands of visitors and thereby put in
circulation a large sum of money, which will add to
the activity of trade. Thus there are both patriotic
snd business considerations to prompt people gener
ally to prive support to the celebration.
LTFON" the business men of San Francisco de-
I pends much of the success of the grand cele
bration of Admission day, and should that suc
ccm; be marked and brilliant it is to them that most of
its material bent-tits will accrue. It is therefore a mat
ter of importance to the business men of the city ss
well as to the Native Sons, and their aid should be
cordially and liberally" extended.
From the reports made public from time to time
it is now assured that the programme of the cele
bration will be one of the most attractive ever ar
ranged on the Pacific Coast. To carry it out upon a
plan worthy of the city and of the occasion will re
quire a considerable expenditure of monej\ for the
display is not to be cheap or tawdry. Therefore con
tributions to the celebration fund should be as gen
erous as the contributors can afford, and, furthermore,
they fhouid be promptly made.
COME UP WITH THE COIN.
Postal Inspector Irwin left this city for Manila last
week, and it is probable he will bring order out of
the apparent chaos that exists there in the soldiers'
mail. Certainly the evil is a serious one. and it is
discreditable to the Government that it should* have
gone on for so long a time. It is the bad condition of
the service in the Philippines that diminishes the sat
isfaction the public feel in the announcement that
the order for giving domestic rates on soldiers' letters
will be issued within a day or two. Why should there
be delay? Why cannct the department act promptly
in a matter so seemingly simple as that of handling
the mail of its soldiers at the front?
The delay of the soldiers' mail is not to be dis
puted. Ample evidence of the wrong can be found
everywhere. In this city many complaints have been
heard concerning it, and a similar condition of af
fairs prevails in every locality where friends and rela
tives of the soldiers are to be found. Thus the
Springfield Republican recently said: "The fact is
not to be questioned that one way and another, no
body seems to know how, letters sent frctan the United
States to the soldiers do not reach them. A soldier
of the Twenty-sixth Regiment, stationed at Iloilo,
Panay, has sent a great many letters to friends in this
cit3% and filled with complaints of being forgotten,
although his friends have written many letters to him
and sent him various packages of newspapers and
small comforts."
In reply to a letter addressed to him on the subject
by a citizen of Springfield the Postmaster General is
quoted by the Republican as saying: "The mails
dispatched by transports from San Francisco of
course make much better time to Manila than those
sent via Hongkong, but of late these transports have
sailed but twice a month, namely, upon the 1st and
16th, hence advantage has also been taken of all such
dispatches as were possible via Hongkong. However,
this y!uch is known â that the sailings from Manila to
Iloilo have been at times somewhat infrequent, and it
is thought that the trouble lies in that quarter. We
have also found that at times the regimental officer
who might be for the moment charged with the
handling of the mails does not always use the care
in searching out individual soldiers that might be pos
sible." 1
For a long time there have been complaints of the
mismanagement of the soldiers' mail. In the Philip
pines the service appears to have been grossly mis
managed. The Army and Nsjvy Journal recently
quoted from the Manila Freedom of May 20 the state
ment: "For a whole dreary month 500 sacks of mail,
destined for these islands, have been rotting in the
holds of the transport Hancock, lying in an Asiatic
port. We are not concerned as to whether the Han
cock has gone off on a fishing excursion or whether
the commission he]^ the ship at Nagasaki in order
to run up to Tokio that they might see the geisha
girls dance. What Manila wants is those 500 sacks
of mail."
DISPATCHES from Washington announce that
"within a day or two" the Postoftice Depart
ment will issue an order extending the privi
lege of domestic rates of postage to United States
soldiers serving in China. The dispatch in itself is
gratifying, but it would have been much more satis
factory if the announcement had been that the order
is to go into effect at once, and that ample arrange
ments have been made for providing a prompt deliv
ery of the mail.
THE SOLDIERS' MfllL.
It is probable that the allied forces will begin to
march on Peking as soon as they can agree upon a
commander in chief. At the present time it seems
doubtful whether the command will be given to a
Jap, a French mulatto or a Cossack. The white man
is not in it.

THE MOST REV. PATRICK W. RIORDAN.
ARCHTHSHOP RIORDAN, is home
again after an absence of eleven
months, a larger part of which
time was spent in Rome. He ar
rived at 5:20 o'clock yesterday afternoon
and was driven to the Cathedral resi
dence. Â¦ His people will have the flrst op
portunity to see and hear him Sunday at
the last mass, at 10:30 a. m., when he will
preach at the cathedral.
The Archbishop left Salt Lake City at
noon Tuesday for the last stage of his
homeward journey. He was met at Sac
ramento by Rev. P. E. Mulligan, his sec
retary, and Rev. Father McQuaid. who
were with. him in Europe but who left him
in Chicago and arrived here two weeks
ago.
At the Sixteenth-street station In Oak
land the train was met by a committee
composed of Garret McEnerney, Judge To
bin, James R. Kelly. John M. Burnett.
"William H. Nolan, Judge J. F. Sullivan
and John Casserly. A number of. clergy
men also met the party there, among
them being Rev. Hugh Lagan, Rev. Philip
O'Ryan and Rev. Edward Dempsey.
Awaiting the Archbishop's arrival at
the ferry depot was a number of clergy
and laity, including Rev. J. J. Prender
gast. Vicar General: Rev. Charles A.
Ramm and Franklin K. Lane.
The homecoming of the Archbishop was
very unostentatious and characteristic of
the modesty that has always marked the
noted prelate. At his request the public
reception that had been planned by lead
ing citizens and clergymen has been aban
doned. His reception on the train and at
the ferry depot yesterday consisted sim
ply of a few hearty grips of the hand and
"Welcome hnmo" in tones that bespoke
the love and veneration in which tho
Archbishop is hold by his people.
â¢ The Archbishop is in excellent health,
with eye brlpht and step elastic. Every
look and eesturo Rives unmistakable evi
dence of his pleasure at being- once more
in California among his own people.
"This pimple greeting is all tho welcome
home that it is fitting I should receive."
tho Archbishop said. *'I am happy to
come out of the heat of the East and the
dust and heat of travel into our glorious
California summer, and I am glad to be
with my people aprain. I shall preach
briefly at the cathedral Sunday morning
at the last mass."
At the cathedral residence a transfor
mation had been worked in preparation
for the Archbishop's homecoming. Grace
ful potted palm?, bamboo and trailing
smilax adornc-il the rooms and lent a new
charm to the simple interior. Roses and
carnations in bouquets and banked
against the background of greenery com
pleted the decoration.
The Archbishop has been absent from
his diocese for eleven months. Xlne
months of that time lie -was in Europe,
and in Romo most of the nine month?.
On the way home he made short visits in
New York, Chicago and Salt Lake City.
At the Request of the Noted. Prelate
There Will Be No' Public
i Reception.

Board of Directors Adopts a
New 6ight-Year Course
of Study.
! â â â¢
The Board of School Director*, at a reg
ular meeting yesterday. droldr *1 to aholfsh
the Longfellow Primary School ami the
Business Evening School, not particularly
as a matter of economy, fur all UmJ teach
ers are retained, but because consolida
tion with other schools is Â«lp<?med to bo
more beneficial to the Interests of the pu
pils. The LonpfelLow school house was
built in 1S73, and never was considered a
good building-. The Rincon schoolhouse.
a modern structure, was built on the same
property, and has room enough In It for
more than half of the ft*"* pupils in thÂ«
Longfellow. The remainder Â¦will be sent
to "Whittier. a block and a half distant.
Miss Jennie Smith, principal of the Long
fellow, by the change becomes principal
of the Rincon School, with a salary of
$175 per month. The name of Rincon will
be changed to I^onjrfellow.
The board adopted a new elffht-yew
course of study. The course is upon line;*
suggested by Superintendent "Webster and
arranged by Professor Cubberly of Stan
ford University. Mr. Webster was very
much opposed to cutting the course of
studv from nine to eight years, but the
board was a unit on the proposlton. and
he did not make any fight. The matter
was put through In such haste that Di
rector Denman frankly confessed that .ha
had given It no attention whatever. The
impression was left that the other mÂ«n-
High School was reduced by tho following
resolutions: " ,
rsASSR c M n r Â«Â£ ."and
privilege of accepting a position tatte Â«Binmer
ctal department of the Lincoln Grammar
School, at a wlary of $1200 per year each
Resolved. That the services of Miss i M -M'che
nÂ»r being no longrer required In the PoinÂ«Â»"'e
High School that she be and la hereby dis
missed. , ,
The salaries of teachers of commercial
arithmetic of the commercial classes In
Lincoln Grammar School were tixed at
5100 per month each, and those of assist
ant teachers at $75. The salary of thÂ«
head of the business department was TLxea
at $153 per month. The equipment of the
Business Evening School haa been re
moved to the Lincoln School, where pupils
desiring a commercial course In the even-
Ing school must report after July J).
Miss Rosa Murdoch was appointed as
sistant In the art department of the Poly
technic High School at a salary of $.a a
month. The study of Spanish has been
discontinued in the Humboldr Evening
School, and Mrs. C K. Martinez, who
has been teaching it. was dismissed from
the department. It was decided that Mra.
A. M. Ilagarty. principal of the Monroe
Primary School, be required to teach a
class, and that Miss C. Herrlck be con
solidated from that school, the change
to take effect August 1. Mrs. H. Grace
was transferred from the Spring \ alley
Kveninff School to the Kumboldt Evening
School, iliss Hattie B. Steel* was as
signed to Redding School, at the request
of the principal.

certain hospitality. He maintains big houses and
gives entertainments that are a nine days' talk for the
idle set in which he lives. It is his privilege to be as
exclusive as he pleases in the company he invites; and
if any uninvited guest wish for a dinner or a- concert
the way is open to himâ let him go and get one for
himself.
It is noteworthy that while the European Cabinets
are raising the issue of good faith against him and lm
Government they are quarreling among themselves
over the control of the railway and as to which shall
have a monopoly of the tugboat service on the rivers.
We do not at all subscribe to the Continental
opinion. We believe that Li Hung Chang is acting
in good faith in the advice he has given the powers.
He has too much at stake to do otherwise.
The most superficial outside observer nuistvcc that
if the foreign legation.- in Peking are still undestroyed
and the legationers alive, an invading movement in
that direction for the purpose cherished by the Con
tinental powers will mean certain slaughter. If the
world desire the relief of the legationers. the cour.-e
of the President offers the only possible hope. The
advance on Peking, with all the forces that the allied
powers can muster, must of necessity be slow, and
long before the armies face the moment of actual as
sault the Government will be powerless to extend
any protection, and from what other source can it
come?
The Continental press has belched a storm of mis
construction and abuse upon the President, and ac
cuses this country of following the lead of China,
even going to the fantastic extent of declaring that
McKinley desires to curry favor with the Chinese in
America! This proves what we have already said, that
many of the Continental Governments are^avcrse to a
peaceful solution. They look upon the murders and
outrages incident to this rebellion as merely a pre
text, too useful and valuable to be neglected as an ex
cuse for the partition of China. - They resent the wiÂ«c
course of the President because it may placate the
Hundreds of millions of Chinese and suddenly change
the whole issue from land-grabbing to a diplomatic
settlement, which will leave Chinese territory intact
and her polity undisturbed.
There is a conspicuous contrast between the firm
but wise and just course of the President of the
United States and that believed to be taken by Rus
sia. The Government of the Czar is suspected of just
such an independent movement upon China as will
produce the worst results, increase the fury of the
rebellious Chinese and the difficulties of their Gov
ernment, and at the same time heighten the friction
between the European Cabinets and extend it, of
course, to their representatives and military forces
upon the scene of action.
1 7 HILE Germany and the nations whose greed
\A / for Chinese territory has been one cause of
\ * the situation do not like it, every thinking man
in the world will commend the tone, phrase and pur
pose of President McKinley's answer to the Emperor
of China. By all such it is recognized as an atti
tude which, taken in the beginning by a cordial con
cert of the Western powers, would have minimized
the affliction which has rioted for the last six weeks.
This country has no territorial designs and no desire
to acutely change the internal polity of China. It
recognizes the straits of a Government confronted by
a vast and sudden rebellion, and the President en
courages China to quell the disturbance, restore or
der and perform her international obligations. Other
nations have had such troubles, and they are not re
mote in point of time. In the uprising of the com
mune in Paris, following the Franco-Prussian war, a
Catholic Archbishop and members of his clergy and
ecclesiastical establishment were first held as hostages
?nd then slaughtered with as little compunction as
the Boxers have shown. Because this was done in
the interregnum between the dechcance and the re
public, no other nation felt called upon to partition
France, though a high ecclesiastic and officers of the
Christian church had been murdered.

MIDWEEK NOTES

to St. Peter became thÂ«* throne of the seej
was kept in the old Basilica of St. Peter's:
was moved about from place to place, and
is now in the present Church of St. Pe
ter's. The chair is square in shape, reads
of wood overlaid with carvwl ivory work
and gold, and the back is bound with iron.
Its height leads to the inference that
there must have been a footrest before it.
The gold decoration is of the finest, and
the exquisitely tarvrd ivory fjr^ups repre
senting eighteen scenes from th<* gospels,
together with the tiny ivory figures on
the outer sides, form a unique monument
to the taste and technical ability of that
period. Unfortunately, however. It Is now
entirely hidden by the covering of bronze
from the Pantheon made for it in 1667 by
Bernini.
Little is known of the furnishings of
Anglo-Saxon England except that the>
were rude and simple until after the Nor
man invasion. Readers of "Ivanhoe" may
recall the hall of Cedric the Saxon, hung
with implements of war and the cha.se.
Seats without backs, stools or benches
were the chief furnishings of the lower
end of the hall, while the dais, thÂ«Â» raised
floor at the upper end. was more com
fortably arranged for the convenience of
the master and mistress of the house ajid
visitors of distinction. The walls were
here, covered with hangings, the floor with
a gaudy carpet and the table with a scar
let cloth. The massive carved chairs oc
cupied by the dignitaries were covered
with a canopy of cloth as a protection
from the rain, which frequently leaked
through the badly constructed roof. At
the end of the fourteenth century these
canopies were made more effectual by
carving them from the wood of which thÂ»
body of the chair was composedâ oak or
chestnutâ sometimes gilded or picked out
in color after the manner of the old "cas
sone-fronts." As these throneliVe affairs
were too cumbersome, for ordinary u?e
they were abandoned toward the end of
the fifteenth century and stools were th&
portable seats until the sixteenth cen
tury, when somewhat smaller, less bulky
chaJrs were introduced.
Noteâ This study will be concluded next
Thursday.
Early Greek furniture was a frank copy
of Egyptian and Asiatic models, with less
of animal form and more of foliation In
decorative motives. AVhile the Greeks at
tained the perfection of style, it was the
Romans who introduced the more lux
uriant and inviting forms cf furniture.
With the Greek, the individual and his
possessions were subordinated to the use
of the State. We therefore find the
Athenian temples and public buildings
adorned with the best that the wealth
of the state could supply, while the home
was but meagerly equipped with tables
and chairs designed upon the basis of a
rigid adherence to purely classic prin
ciples. The luxurious Roman household,
on the contrary, evinced a distinct degra
dation of the canons of taste, modified by
The wonderfully dry climate of Egypt
has preserved for us specimens of antique
furniture whose designs are constantly
reproduced in our own day. The modern
housewife who furnishes her apartments
with a seat like the one in the illustra
tion, under the Impression that It is of
comparatively recent design will be sur
prised to learn that the original of the
picture is an ebony seat inlaid with ivory
now In the British museum, and is at
least 3000 years old. Doubtless the mater
ials of its construction, combined with
the preservative nature of the climate,
had much to do with its long life. Parts
of animals, bulls' hoofs, lions' feet and
leopard's tails, formed the supports or
ornamentation of nearly all Oriental
furniture decorations, and not infrequent
ly human figures were represented in the
degrading position of captives supporting
the victor's throne.
Like the table, the chair was in peneral
use among the nations of antiquity. It
seems strange that an article of furniture
so well known to Egyptians, Assyrians.
Greeks, Etruscans and Romans should
have fallen Into disuse during the medi
eval period; yet such waa its fate, and
it crept back so slowly through curious
modifications of other furnishings that it
was not again common in the houses of
the people before the days of Cromwell.

Stroke.
COLUSA, July 25.â Lot D. Slocum, the
well-known liveryman of San Francisco,
diod suddenly at hi s> lodging-house last
night. He had been attending the races
all day, and one of his horses, Teddy, won
second money in one of yesterday's prin
cipal events, llr. Slocum ate a very
hearty supper when he came from the
track and seemed to be in his usual good
health up to the time he went to bed, but
a very short time afterward he called one
of his friends, saying he was in awful
misery, and asking him to go for a doc
tor.
Dr. Luman was soon at his bedside and
relieved him for a short time, but another
attack came on and Slocum died almost
before those near him could realize his
extremity. The doctor says his death was
caused by heart trouble, but as a Coro
ner's inquest was waived, the exact cause
could not be learned. His remains were
shipped to San Francisco to-dav.

Lieutenant Martin and" posse last night
raided a "bucket shop" on Ellis street.
near Stockton, and arrested M. Burke, A.
Pritchard and H. Muller. They were re
leased on cash bail furnished by W. D.
Valentine, the proprietor of the place.
Raided a "Bucket Shop."
After considerable trouble a jury was
finally selected in Judge Conlan's court
yesterday to try the case of Joseph Peck
erman, charged with selling pools on a
prize fight in violation of a city ordinance.
The trial will commence at 2 o'clock this
afternoon.
As soon as Chief Sullivan -and Captain
Seymour were served with the papers the
Chief Instructed Secretary Cadwalader
to call a meeting of the Police Commis
sioners to discuss the situation with him.
They were all present at 5 o'clock with
tho exception of Commissioner Wallace,
and as he waa unable to come it was de
cided to adjourn and meet again this
morning.
The Chief says there is a decision In
the New York courts that upholds the
position he has taken, but to prevent any
trouble he ordered the officers at the va
rious poolrooms not to remain inside the
rooms, but keep on the sidewalk In front
till Judge Shaw renders his decision.
The citation ordering the police officials
to appear an<l show cause why they
should not be punished for contempt of
court was issued on an affidavit filed by
Poolseller Crowley. In his affidavit Crow
ley alleged that on "July 20 Captain John
Spillane and Captain George \V. Wittman,
acting together, willfully and deliberately
and in open ard contumacious defiance
and disobedience of the restraining order
heretofore issued entered into, without the
permission and against the will and ex
pressed protest of the plaintiffs, their sev
eral premises and did on July 21, 22 and 23
intrude upon, disturb, molest and inter
fere with the enjoyment and control of
the premises named.
'â¢None of these acts so committed by
Chief of Police Sullivan and his subordi
nates," the affidavit continues, "were by
them claimed to be for the purpose of
making the arrest or arrest of persons
who were actually attempting treason,
felony or breach of the peace, nor to ar
rest a person who had committed crime
and had escaped and taken refuge in any
of the premises named."
Following the issuance of the citation
for contempt Attorney George D. Collins,
who represents the poolsellers, filed a
new complaint and application for an
injunction to restrain the police from in
terfering with the poolsellers. In this com
plaint the validity of ordinance 86, bill
119, is attacked. This ordinance prohibits
the selling of pools, bookmaking or the
conduct of any system of registering bets
or wagers and fixes the penalty for vio
lations at a flue of $500 or six months'
imprisonment or both. After setting forth
the facts contained in Crowley's affidavit
it is alleged in the complaint that the or
dinance in question is unconstitutional;
that it is in violation of sections of both
Federal and State constitutions and in
addition conflicts with provisions of the
local charter.
The battle for supremacy between the
police and local poolsellers and book
makers is waxing warm. Chief of Police
Sullivan, Captain Spillane, Captain Sey
mour and Captain Wittman have been
cited by Judge Lucien Shaw, now sitting
in Judgre Murasky's department of the Su
perior Court, to appear in court this af
ternoon at 2 o'clock and show cause, if
such they have, why they should not be
punished for contempt of court. It Is
charged that the police ofllclals are ignor
ing a writ of injunction heretofore issued
lestraining them from interfering with
the conduct of business at the establish
ments of Poolsellers 11. E. Corbett, Henry
Schwartz, Zick Abrams and D. J. Crow

REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
NEW YORK. July 25.â The attempt to take
Speculative profits In the market, barren of
any real buying demand, had its natural re
sult In a. further decline of prices to-day. The
reaction which set in yesterday also encouraged
the puttinc out of some fresh ehort lines.
Eut the bears were by no means aggressive In
their operations and the speculators on the
long side were apparently well enough fortified
to be free from ih<* necessity of liquidation
on a rapidly falling market. The declining
tendency of prices consequently showed abate
ment Â¦<Â¦ the day were on and the closing was
fairly eteady, but fractional declines be
ing the rule. There was no evidence of re
newed manipulation for an advance, the one
or two strong hpots which were In evidence
during the day apl^aring to be due to in
<3ff*?ndent cause*. American Tobacco was well
bought na the belief that the forthcoming re
port will show extraordinary earnlnps. Met
ropolitan Street Railway was marked up 3'i
from the low point without any news to ex
plain the movement. There were firm fpÂ«>is
also in the railroad lieu notably In Southern
Pacific and Boathem Railway preferred, but
tlif-se did net rÂ»";irerÂ«r.t any aggressive stand
agittnst the reaction. The cassation of pres
(.ure to realize aroused & natural expectation
forts fur an advance. While this expectation
continued operations by the bears were not
forthcoming. The conditions In foreign markets
were a 'irpr^e&ing Influence, especially the fear
reported from London and on the Continent of
Â£j broaching fctrir.ger.ry m the money market.
Money in London continues firm and Â¦terllnit
txchange here advanced a fraction and it Is
considered certain that the receipt of gold from
Western points will be followed by a. renewed
outeo of the raetal.

CHICAGO, July 25.â September wheat started
VfGM over the previous close at 75V4c to 7oHc,
scalpers buying on a half-hearted hope of a
rally following the recent heavy decline. Their
hopes were blasted In short order, however,
for there was no support at that time. Cable*
we-re weak, weather In the Northwest favorable
for harvesting and outside people apparently
did not know there was such a thing as a
wheat market in this city. The market began
to decline and as lt went down stop-loss orders !
were caught and the liquidation thus induced I
ht-Iped the slump along. Liverpool paid that i
Argentine wheat was being offered cheap and I
that the English talent expected liberal ar- i
rivals from Russia. Mot until September I
bumped against 74%c, the bottom of the pres
ent/decline, did the market receive much sup- 1
pOTt. Soon after the cash part of the markrÂ»t |
began to attract attention. Cash people had \
sold between 500.000 and 7C0.0OO bushels, mest !
of It hard Kansas, and were covering in the
pit. Shorts were further Jolted by a cable
announcing a reduction in the estimate of the
French crop from 310,000,000 bushels to 250,000,
Â«0 bushels. Trade became active and Sep
tember rallied steadily to 73"Â»c and closed soon
alter In a firm condition. September US^fcC
over yesterday at 75ViS7o%c.
Fine growing weather over the largest area
ever planted, giving promise of a bumper
crop, caused a further decline In corn. Sep
tember closed J sC under yesterday at 37*ic
Oats were quiet. September closed He under
yesterday at 23c.
Provisions were dull and fluctuated under the
guidance of wheat and corn. The shipping de
mand for the product was fair, but the out
side trade was Indifferent, packers not buying
and hogs lowr at the yards. The close, how
ever, was steady. September pork closed 13c
uiidf^r yesterday, lard 2Vsc down and ribs 5c
lower.

Chicago Livestock Market.
BOSTON. July 25.â The Wool and Cotton Re
porter will say: The wool market has shown
a distinct improvement during the past week.
TherÂ« have been manufacturers in the market
looking around. Mere inquiries for some bags
have been received by mail and more wool
has been actually sold, including some good
sized lines of territory, Texas and quarter and
three-eighths blood fleece. One large woolen
mill Is reported to have taken a conslderab.*
line of territory and California wools. Mo3t
of the wools, of course, were old wools, but
they reduce considerably the amount of sucli
etock which has been hanging over the mar
ket awaiting purchasers. Holders are not now
so urgent In forcing the wool as they wer*
and a better feeling exists. Manufacturers In
many instances are talking quite encouragingly
and it Is felt that Just as soon as orders are
placed for lightweight goods there will be
more business In the wool market, for the
many large consumers have acknoivJedged that
they have been running down very close to
bare boards for some time past.
The sales of the week In Boston amounted to
2.157,000 pounds domestic and 190,000 pounds
foreign, making a total of 2,347.000 pounds,
against a total of 1,663,000 pounds for the pre
vious week and a total of f.271.000 for the cor
responding week last year. The sales since
January 1 amount to 74,822,800 pounds, against
157.047.000 pounds for the corresponding time
last year.

Overturned Lamp Causes Destruction
of a Pacific-Street I/Odging-
House and Saloon.
i- ire i>roKe out in tne tour-story irame
building occupied by Manuel Gomez a? a
saloon and sailers' lodging house at 416
Pacific street last night. The building,
which was badly gutted, was one of the
oldest in the city. The age of the struc
ture caused it to burn like tinder and for
a time it seemed a serious fire was im
minent. . Chief Sullivan, on arriving at
the scene, caused a second alarm to be
turned in. and the blaze was confined to
the building in which it originated.
The fire was caused by the overturning
of a lamp in the room of Jose Silva on the
top floor. Silva attempted to extinguish
the flames himself, but they got beyond
his control and he shouted for help. Po
liceman Skain and Special Joseph Gillen
aroused all the inmates and heroically
made their way to the top f'.oor of the
building and rescued John Fallon and
wife, an aged couple who were asleep.
The department found much difficulty
in fighting the fire even when an ad
ditional relay of engines arrived. The
loss will reach $2000.

Bulletin.
SAN* JOSE. July 25.â The California
Cured Fruit Association issued its second
bulletin to-day. It is as follows:
The conditions that existed relative to the
prune drop when our last bulletin was Issued
still continue. The "June drop" has been ex
tended into a "July drot>." The causes that
operated to produce the heavy drcp have also
affected many prunes that will remain on the
trees until the first packing. The complaint of
defective prunes is quite general. Reports from
some sections also are that the prunes are
nankins largely on the ends Â«f the limbs. These
conditions serve to diminish considerably the
crop estimate made ten days ago.
There is a notable lack of uniformity In the
condition of prune orchards. In some the fruit
Is laree and in prime condition. In others small
and containing much that Is blighted This will
result in a wide difference In the quality of the
fruit offered for sale. All fruits are ripening
much earlier than usual. Prune picking will
commence In many sections by August 1.
Growers are advised that a thorough system
of inspection is being inaugurated to prevent
blighted and defective fruit from bÂ»ing mar
keted It wlU. therefore, be to their advantage
and save the Inspectors much annoyance If the
defective and blighted fruit, which usually
drops first, is picked up and destroyed or fed to

No defective or diseased fruit will be received

islands In the group -will be visited and
wherever the United States flag floats it

Andrew "Wilkie Jr., the contractor for

peck of trouble. The building is nearing
completion and there is due him on it
about $S000. At- the meeting of the com

$12,0^0 were presented and the board was
notified not to pay Wilkie the balance due
him. The American Bonding and Trust
Company also served a notice on the
Commission. It is on "Wilkie's bond for
$12,000. so the Harbor Commissioners will
not suffer in any way.

board where the Pacific Steam Naviga
tion Company, whose steamers will begin
running here from South and Central

until she has been passed by the doctor
and the customs inspector. Under the old
law runners and- agents for various fi'-ms

It was to keep these runners under con
trol that the police had always to be con
veniently at hand.
The crowd was so great that the steam

and for the first time in a year Captain
Howard sent the mail boat, away ten

The other party was composed of Prince

Powers. Witness refused to talk with
Matthews or to consider the statement.
Witness said Caleb Powers then Joined

Two Are Sent to Jail by Judge Con-
Ian and Others Will
Follow.
Chief Sullivan received a petition Tues
day signed by forty-one firms and resi
dents in the district between Third and
Seventh and Berry and Channel | streets
asking for , Increased ' police 'protection.
They stated that a gang of "bums," who
lived on the "dumps," were constantly
pilfering from their premises and were
careful to do it when the policemen were
changing watches . arid the coast Â¦was
clear.
Captain Splllane detailed Policemen Re
gan and O'Connell on the case, and Tues
day night they arrested two of the pang,
Louis Fresslnger and John J. Jasarlng. on
a charge of vagrancy. They appeared be
fore Judge Conlan yesterday and the
Judge sentenced them to six months each
In the County Jail. â¢
. Chief. Sullivan had shown the Judge the
petition, and he told the two arresting of-

fleers to bring In the rest of the gang and
he would give each the same sentence.
They arrested two others yesterday after
noon. William Clater and Mike Murphy,
and booked them for vagrancy.
Before the crematory was established
there was a regular colony living on the
"dumps," who eked out an existence by
collecting food and stray articles from the
garbage deposited there. They had a
Mayor and advisory board, and it was
difficult for a newcomer to get a location.
A remnant of the colony still hangs out
in the neighborhood.

To Banquet an Editor.
D. O. Haynes, proprietor of tho New
York Commercial, is now in this city,
and to-morrow evening he will be ten
dered a banquet by the local merchants at
the Palace Hotel. Mr.- Haynes proposes
to establish in San Francisco a branch
of his paper and give daily all of the com
mercial news of the world. He has been
looking over the field here, and many of
the wholesale merchants are interested
in his project, giving him all encourage
ment. At the banquet in his honor the
number will be limited to fifty. The in
vitations are sent out by Irving M. Scott,
William Thomas, A. O. Freeman and
Joseph SloÂ£s.
Â¦A'rullng.of Importance to retail liquor
dealers has been received from the office
of the Internal Revenue Department at
Washington. The substance of it Is that
a retail , dealer who mixes whisky or
other distilled spirits with coloring mat
ter or materials of any kind, changing- it
Into compound liquor, if he makes this
Ruling Concerning Mixed Drinks.
acy against him might follow on other
charges.
"The affidavit filed by the District At
torney does not state that such a charge
is liable to be made against this respond
ent," said Judge Dunne. "These Â«jues
tlons are plainly pertinent In the investi
gation of the wrongdoings of John M.
Chretien and I fall to see where any
answer this respondent may give Â¦would
give him the right to refuse to testify
under the privilege granted defendants
under section 20C5."
"I cannot say what these answers, may
be," said Henley. "I do not know w-hat
position answers to these questions would
place him In, nor can your Honors. If the
prosecution would' say that he is free
from danger of being prosecuted we will
have advanced a step further, but as the
prosecution docs not see fit to admit that
this respondent is free from such danger
1 am of opinion that we can successfully
urge the rule."
"Mr. Henley' has arrived at the gist of
this argument," said District Attorney
Uylngton. "This respondent must an
swer these question^, unless he can show
to the satisfaction of the court that his
answers would place him in danger."
"Adherence to the theory advanced by
the District Attorney would involve a de
tailed statement which as I have before
stated would defeat the object of the rule
which we now seek to take advantage
of," wa.s Henley's answer to the District
Attorney, and his words were the last of
the argument. - â¢ . . . Â¦
Judges Dunne and Bahrs consulted for
a few minutes. Judge Dunne then turned
and addressing Mr. Rogers said: "This
court is of the opinion that the grounds
upon which you base your refusal to an-
Bwcr the questions propounded by the
Grand Jury are untenable. It Is the opin
ion of this court that the questions asked
were pertinent to the issues Involved in
the investigation before that body. In
accordance with theso views the witness
Is Instructed to answer theso questions as
urged. I fool that it Is unnecessary at
this time for me to Inform the witness
that a refusal to comply with this order
of the court will subject him to further
contempt proceedings which will be dealt
with accordingly."
When Rogers saw the barrier swept
aside that for a few days had protected
him from adding his own evidence to that
already against him he visibly paled.
Walking un to District Attorney Bying
ton he said: "When will my presence be
required by tho Grand Jury?" Â¦
"It will meet on Friday, but If I need
you before that time I will communicate
with you," answered Bvlngton,
Rogers and counsel then left the court.
As they passed down the corridor no
word passed between .Â¦ them. Rogers
seemed wranned In. deepest thought.

ROGERS IS ORDERED TO
TESTIFY OR GO TO JAIL
â â¢
JAMES TAYLOR ROGERS hafc lis
tened to the passing of Judgment
upon him and not without a tremo-.
He must answer before the Grand
Jury each and every question propounded
by Foreman W. T. Kibbler or go to jail
for contempt of that body's authority.
Judges Bahrs and Dunne, sitting in bank,
after a brief hearing yesterday morning
handed down an opinion that swept aside
the plea Rogers had made to shield him
self. Though he made oath that his an
swers would have a tendency to incrim
inate him: would lay him liable to prosc
1 cution for a felony and subject him to
dishonor and disgrace, the court held that
the interests of justice would best bo sub
served by his compliance with the de
mand of the Grand Jury.
Barclay Henley. Rogers 1 attorney, took
an exception to the ruling of the court
and before the Supreme tribunal of the
Ftate James Taylor Rogers may further
insist that as one liable to a prosecution
for felony he should be protected under
section 2"Â«w of the Code of Civil Procedure,
a right granted those charged with fel
ony. What success awaits his effort Is
as yet a matter of speculation.
Fearful that the result would be as it
later proved to be Rogers, when the mat
ter of contempt proceedings against him
was again called by Judpos Rahrs and
Dunne, again raised his hand and made
oath that if by order of court he was
compelled to answer the questions pro
pounded by the Grand Jury he was liable
to prosecution- for felony. He filed an
amended "answer" to the affidavit placed
on record by District Attorney Byington,
which was the moving paper in the pr^-
coC'dingF. This answer was *a beautiful
evasion of the Issue at bar and a tire
some reiteration of the story he told
before Judge Troutt during the investi
gation of charges against the ring proved
guilty of the theft of one estate ami the
conspirators who planned the theft i>t
other estates of the intestate and unpro
tected dead. It again awakened interest,
however, when it reached that clause in
which Rogers again pleaded his right to
the protection of oft quoted section 20C%.
Rogers' assertion of his right to this pro
tection Is more detailed than that con
tained in the pleading filed on the lirst
day's proceeding. This is his statement
under oath:
After the testimony of all the witnessesâ
about twelve or lUteen in numberâ had been
fdven before the Grand Jury on Friday.
July 20 190u. affiant was railed before that
body and the questions were addressed to
him substantially as set forth in the af
fidavit made by YV. T. Kibbler. Affiant,
JVarlngr and believing: that the object of his
examination by tho Grand Jury was sim
ply to elicit from him inculpatory evidence
tending to convict him of some criminal
orense, declined to answer the questions
or any of them; and that It was at the time
thÂ» <iuef=tions were fo addressed to affiant
his belief was and now is that it was the
purpose of the prosecutins officers of the
city and county of Pan Francisco to make
out of his testimony a case which would
have a. direct tendency to degrade his char
acter and to set on foot proceedings looklns
to his disbarment and to a denial of his
rights to practice law in the courts of this
Â£ta.te. Affiant in declining to answer th*
<juÂ«-Ftlons propounded to him placed his rleht
to do so upon the provisions of section 2065
of the Code of Civil Procedure and in that
connection he re! erred to a paper read by
him on July 17. 1SO0. before the Orand Jury
and of which the following Is a copy:
"It is my belief that a conspiracy is
formed to victimize me, although innocent.
Therefore by the advice of my attorney,
Barclay Henley, I hereby most respect
fully decline to answer any question that
may tÂ»e asked me and base my refusal on
section 20C5 of the Code of Civil Procedure,
which reads as follows:
â¢Â¦ 'A witness mupt answer questions legal
and pertinent to the matter In Issue,
thoufrh hln answer may establish a claim
acalrist himself; but he need not give an
answer which will have a tendency to nub-
Jed h:m to punishment for a felony; nor
ner-d he give an answer which will have a
direct tendency to dejcra<3e h:s character,
unless It be to the very fact In Issue or
to a fact from which the fact in issue
would be presumed. Hut a witness must
anpwrr as to the fact of his previous con
viction for felony." "
Afllant then and there declined tt> answer
puch Question and now so declines because
he is privileged under section 20C5 above
quoted and also because the constitution of
the United States, fifth amendment, de
clarer that It is an Inalienable right that
no person phall be compelled in any crim
nal ense to be a witness against himself.
Affiant further avers upon information
and belief that the Orand Jury has not yet
concluded Its Investigation and desires to
force affiant to answer such questions, to
pfther with others that may be asked, for
the riuirose of presenting: some criminal
charge against him or of eliciting such tes
timony as intent be used toward his dis
barment.
After this lengthy pleading of the pro
tection he held should be granted him un
der that section of the code behind which
criminals often shield themselves Roger*
reiterated the story he told on the stand
before Judge Troutt of the manner in
which he was "convinced" that the heirs
he represented were not the legal heirs
of the estate of the late Joseph Sullivan.
Continuing Rogers' "answer" says:
Affiant and J. J. Rauer went to the III
bernla Bank and ascertained from informa
tion srlven by the clerk, who furnished the
same from one of the books of the bank,
that the representation of J. J. Kauer and
Chretien as to the maiden name of the
mother of the deceased was as claimed by
them. Thereupon, on the same day, afflant
went at once to the chambers of Hon. James
M. Troutt and communicated to him the in
formation that afflant had obtained at the
bank and announced to him that he (afll
ant> a\a not propose thereafter to have any
thlng 1 more to do with the case â belne eat
lsfle;J that- the Information as to the helre
whom he had previously represented waa
untrue. ,
J. J. Rauer swore before the Grand Jury
that it took J600 of his money to convince
James Taylor Rogers that the heirs he
represented were not the lawful heirs,
and that "John Sullivan" was the only
living- heir of Joseph Sullivan, deceased.
When this portion of Rogers' statement
was read no comment was made by the
District Attorney. Rogers was reading
his own plea. Barclay Henley pleaded a
col<1 and requested tne court to permit
Rogers to conduct that portion of his
defense. Rogers frequently tripped over
his own words as he proceeded, but the
court and District Attorney gave him
close attention. When he had concluded
Barclay Henley, who had supplied him
self with authorities he held substanti
ated his contention that Rogers was only
ptanding on his rights when he refused
to testify, rose to argue the points in
Issue.
"The rule that was laid down In the
celebrated trial of Aaron Burr so many
years ago applies in this case," said Mr.
Henley. "I admit that it Is not discre
tionary with a witness to take advantage
of that section of the code which privi
leges defendants from testifying against
themselves, but this right must be grant
ed this respondent when It is shown that
he is acting in good faith. At least the
court will consider the danger which con
fronts this respondent when he considers
that he stands in the light of having
been approached with overtures of a cor
rupt character to which he finally suc
cumbed as is alleged, and also that he
betrayed the trust of foreign clients. ( It
is clear that this proceeding In aimed at
tba respondent and the District Attorney

Fear That His
Â¦ Disbarment Is
Being Sought,
will not sayâ cannot say that answers to
these questions are desired for any other
purpose than is alleged in this respond
ent's affidavit."
"I cannot see, even in view of the fact
being proved that James Taylor Rogers
betraved his London clients and did so
after being in receipt of a corrupt con
sideration, that this would lay him liable
to prosecution for felony." said Judge
Hahrs. "Unfortunately, our law makes
no provision for the punishment of such
an offense and I will call upon counsel to
point out, as far as possible, without waiv
ing the rights of his client, the offense
which this respondent alleges in his afll
davit he is in danger of being prosecuted
for."
"It Is not for us to explain our opinion
fully," answered Henley, after consulting
the Penal Code. "If we did the object of
the rule we herein invoke on behalf of
this respondent would be defeated."
At this point Judge Dunne took an
active part in the discussion of Rogers'
rights. "There are no doubts but that the
questions contained In the moving paper
filed by the District Attorney are perti
nent to the issue," paid he, with' an in
flection of assertion.
"There is no doubt as to that point, but
this court must consider the animus that
prompts this proceeding." paid Henley.
"If the prosecution here would admit
that it was engaged in an effort to fasten
a crime upon this respondent It would end
the controversy right here. *Then there
would be no doubt as to the right of Mr.
Ropers to invoke the protection of sec
tion 2063. This is an incontrovertible at
tempt to wrench information from James
Taylor Rogers, for what purpose? Rauer
has sworn before the Grand Jury that he
paid Rogers a. sum of money to withdraw
his contest of the application of John Sul
livan for the distribution to him of the
properties of the late Joseph Sullivan.
Chretien has made statements against
this respondent and now the Grand Jury
would have htm testify against himself.
Though there is no evidence that any
answer which might be given by this re
spondent to any of the questions pro
pounded hy the Grand Jury would in
criminate him, still a charge of conspir-
