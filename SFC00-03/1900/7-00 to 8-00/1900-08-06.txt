business with Tientsin. The combined forces are ignoring all commercial interests. This could not
be avoided without detriment to the military operations. Land transport will be difficult, as heavy
rains are reported to the north.

of Tientsin and of the
many thrilling incidents connected with
it, obtained from British officers who were
in tho fighting, and also by a letter from
one. of the besieges. The account is as
follows:
The bombardment started at 3 p. m.Â» ex
actly on Sunday, June 17, two guns being
fired in quick succession, then two more.
The first appearance of the Boxers was
on the 15th. when they were seen from the
high buildings in the concession carrying
lamps. -There appeared to be thousands of
them, for the procession they made was
miles in length, and scon fires were start
ed."-the quarters of the native Christians
being given; to the flames and their occu
pants butchered. They tried hard to set
fire to the old Catholic cathedral, and
many of the : onlookers thought the his
toric structure -had been destroyed, but
although fires danced around it, it was
seen to be little damaged on the following
day. The same night an attack was made
on the railway station across the river.
The station was held by Russians. The
attack failed, although some of the bolder
spirits of. the Boxers got- within fifty
yards of the station. The Russian fire
accounted for a great number of Boxers.
The Boxers .were then, supposed to be
marching on the concession, making for
the bridge. .'

After the attack had been repulsed all
was quiet for a time, until 4 a. m., on the

sounded all through the settlement and

YUNG LU TO ESCORT MINISTERS TO TIENTSIN.
SHANGHAI, Aug. 5 (Bycable to London Mail). â An imperial edict, dated August 2, has
been received here. It orders General Yung Lu to select high military and civil dignitaries, to-,
gether with a sufficient number of picked troops, to escort the foreign Ministers to Tientsin as sqonjl
as they decide to leave Peking. By the terms of the edict General Yung Lu will be held personally \
responsible for their safety and he is given full authority to deal summarily with those opposing
the peaceful passage of the escort. "By such acts," concludes the edict, "do we show our good
intentions to the people from afar and -open our bosoms to them."
* PARIS, Aug. 5, 7 p. m. â Chang, Director General of Railways and Telegraphs, has just
communicated to the Consuls at Shanghai, according to a special dispatch to the Temps, dated Au
gust 5, an imperial decree, dated August 2, authorizing the foreign Ministers in Peking to commu
nicate without restriction with their governments and ordering their departure for Tientsin under
a guard escort.
CAPE MAY, N. J., Aug. 5. â Minister Wu Ting Fang to-night said that the dispatch to
the Paris Temps stating that an imperial decree was issued under date of August 2, allowing the
Ministers in Peking free communication with their home countries was probably true and the re
sult of the memorial of the Chinese Ministers in all countries asking, through Li Hung Chang
and other Viceroys, for this privilege. t He, however, said no official news confirming the issuance
of the edict had been received.
forces of Boxers and imperial troops have worked round to the south of Tientsin and may cut the
lines of communication unless a sufficient force remains in Tientsin.
TIENTSIN, July 26, via Chefu, Aug. 4. â It appears that the Chinese are rapidly falling
back on the capital and that the allies will find alarge army opposing them near. Peking. Certain
Chinese, whose exact status it is difficult to ascertain, have arrived here and are trying to initiate
peace overtures. This question has now probably been unsettled by receipt of orders from Wash
ington ordering the Americans to advance immediately and promising strong reinforcements.
The opinion prevails here that the Russians are quietly sending bodies of troops through toward
the northeast with the object of meeting the Russians coming from Shanhankwan toward Peking.

cently applied for service In China. His
application has not been granted, nor Is
there any likelihood that it will be. War
Department officials say that General
Chaffee was sent to China to command
the American troops, and to relieve him
at this time would be a reflection upon his
conduct of affairs.
General Miles thinks the situation in
China is most serious, and, setting aside
all questions of his own wishes, he is
making- every j effort to equip General
Chaffee's command to stand the rigors or
climate and to operate effectively.
There will he no delay by the "War De
partment in ; getting reinforcements to
China. The schedule thus far made out
contemplates the* departure of troops as
follows: â¢ : ' : r- â¢Â¦Â»*.
. On August 7. transport Garonne with
tv:o squadrons First Cavalry and recruits;
August 16. Wren with two squadrons
Ninth Cavalry and recruits; August 22.
Belgian King with siege battery, recruits
and animals. August 23, Rosecrans with
two batteries Seventh Artillery and re
cruits.
For additional troops under orders to
the far East General Ludington will have
available the Logan,.whlch v/ill be ready
to sail on September 1; Thomas, Septem
ber 16; Grant, October 1. and Sheridan,^
OctoHer 16. It will, therefore, be unneces
sary to charter any additional transports.
During last week he has chartered six
ships.
General XfcJinRton has instructed
Quartermaster!! acobs to buy 2000 horses
and 170 pack mules for use In Ch.na.
Large supplies of forage for both horses
and mules are being sent to Taku.
Forty-six thousand men comprise the
International force which is to march to
Peking. There is good authority for the
statement that every government will be
represented in the advance. The opera
i.ons thus far have been chiefly recon
noissances, in which American, British
and Japanese troops have participated.
So far: as co-operation by the Rallied
troopse now at Tientsin is concerned, the
authorities profess to believe it is as
sured. -Such co-operation was rendered
more feasible by the decision that in the
advance -.each' force should be under the
independent command of its own officers,
but should keep in touch with the flanks
of the columns between which it was op
erating, or "in case its position was on the
extreme Hank, should protect the force
next to it. It is held by the officials that
had the allies waited until a commander-
In-chief had boen chosen there would
have been delay, and possibly then some
of the troops which object to serving un
der a foreign commander-ln-chief would
decline to take part.
Notwithstanding reports to the con
trary, it is the belief here, based upon in
formation from General Chsffee, that
i when the general advance really begins
all the allies will take part. It is un
derstood that General ChalTee has re
ported that there were at Tientsin 17 000
Japanese, 8000 Rursians, 3000 English, 3000
Americans and a 1 small force of Germans.
Some of :these troops will remain behind
to guard Tientsin, but only a small num
ber will be required,, military experts
think, as the Chinese will find Jt"neces
sary to place all their available forces
before Peking to oppose the allies' ad
vance. â¢ Â¦â¢-â¢Â¦Â¦. . Â¦ .
Infantry, cavalry and artillery will take
part in the "movement, the cavalry do
ing the scouting for the main body. War
Department officials express the opinion
that it will soon be possible to send a
steady stream of r reinforcements from
Taku to Tientsin -and thence on- to join
the main expedition. - , .-.-.
Though hopeful that- the Chinese will
succumb to the , inevitable , and surrender
the Ministers, It If nlaln to the authorities
that they are preparing to make a des
perate resistance.

had a narrow escape.

There is a nimor from Shanghai, via Paris, that the advance guard of the allies has been re

A dispatch from Chefu states that the Governor of Moukden has ordered the massacre of all
Christians in Manchuria.
By this time, if the details given in the dispatch from Tientsin to the London morning papers
are correct, tlie main body of the relief expedition must have covered about a third of the distance to Pe

the Americans and British instead of taking the lead were in one case not ready to move and in another
instance, lor some unspecified reason, did not join in the movement of the main body which left Tien

LONDON, Aug. 6â4 a. m.â The Ameri
can and British forces began the advance
on Peking last Thursday, according to a
dispatch dated August 2, from Tientsin to
the Dally Express. "The main body of
the allies," continues the correspondent,
"marched July 30. General Chaffee was
delayed by difficulties of disembarkation.
General Uorward, the British commander,
had no such obstacles and his delay is In
explicable.
"The other foreign troops are now half

Japanese under General Yamachuchi, and
10,000 Russians. The British force totals
9000 men and the other foreign troops are
7000. We are weak in artillery. On Au
eust 1 a strong force of Chinese from the
native city attacked Tientsin. By a
series of . brilliant charges our -troops
drove the enemy from their positions. The
native city is still defiant and the allies
are unwilling to march troops through its
streets, as this would mean an immense
slaughter. When the Chinese saw so
large a body of troops marching west
ward they apparently believed they would
have an easy victory over those who were
left" Â¦ ;-:
AmeFsape to the same paper from a
correspondent in Peking, dated July 22,
says: "The women have borne all. the hor
rors with marvelous fortitude and even
cheerfulness. The Chinese wanted' peace
when the arsenals at Tientsin were cap
tured, and the negotiations bade fair to
be successful. Unfortunately, LI' Ping
Henp and KangYu arrived here atthe
critical 'moment and overthrew the peace
party. .Food has been short, but not ter
ribly so. though we have had to be very
careful."
46,000 ALLIES ARE
MARCHING ON PEKING
The escape of the Chinese in the fort
was astutely accomplished. When they
saw that they would have to yield they
placed rows of firecrackers in prominent
places and set fire to them. The series
of small explosions misled the Russians,
who were in front, and, taking the noise
for rifle fire, hesitated to make a final
rush. The respite allowed the escape of
the Chinese.
A few days* of comparative quietness
followed, and when the Englishmen who
brought the story of the siege to Kobe
left, on July 4, the bombardment wa3 just
beginning to recommence in earnest. The
fort was firing heavily from 9 to 1 p. m.
each day, and there was not a gun to re
ply, for the Terrible's gun had been
moved out beyond the woolen mills. The
Russians sent for it, and it was sent over,
but It was under cross fire, and when one
Â¦ crew had been killed it was withdrawn.
The Pelho River was a sight top grew
some for words, say the arrivals from
Tientsin. Bodies lined the banks, dogs
devouring them on all sides, and floating
corpses were passed every few .minutes.
The French concession was absolutely
wrecked; not so much from the shelling
as by fires, etc. Very many shells
fell about the yard and around the Jap
anese, consulate, and some comment was
thus occasioned, but It is, explained that
the Chinese fire was drawn there by the
high towers In line with itâ those on the
Gordon Hall and'Astor House.'
Although scarcely any civilian suffered
during the bombardment, hardly a night
passed without one or more of the de
fenders being killed. Midshipman Don

British forces was struck by a ricochet

lowed by the destruction of the fort,
which blew up after a shell had been
planted in it with an explosion that
shook Tientsin. The Cossacks who had
been sent out to meet the Terrible's 12
pounder, on the carriage of which the
sailors had engraved the legend "Lady
smith to Tientsin, immediate." hugged
and kissed the gun as it was returned to
the barracks. They had been so long
trying without success to silence the gun.
The arsenal was in the hands of the al
lied force by noon, but not without much
fighting. The Chinese were strongly in
trenched, and resisted strenuously. The
placing of the shells inside by the Terri
ble's gun. though, set the fort on fire,
and the Chinese fled. â¢ â
The Russian commander issued a
proclamation after the capture of the
fort, which read: "By the help of God

BRYAN LEAVES
TO RECEIVE THE
NOTIFICATION
The only three hanks In Manila have
formed a. ring to reduce arbitrarily the
rate of exchange for American Bold. This
has caused widespread indignation and
many difficulties for commerce and minor
business. The banks, however, are ob
durate.
On September 1 the commission, headed
by Judge Taft. will become the legislative
body of the Philippines, with power to
take and appropriate insular moneys, then
establish judicial and educational systems
and-to make and pass laws.
No money will be permitted to be drawn
from the insular funds except by author
ization of the committee. Judgre'Taft and
his colleagues will also exercise certain
executive functions. For instance, they
will appoint Judges, officials in -the edu
cational department and officers of muni
cipalities.
Oeneral MacArthur will be the executive
head to enforce the laws of the commis
sion and he will conduct the government
in accordance with the same until tho
commission recommends to President 5Ic-
Kiniey the appointment of a civil gov
ernor.

Charles V. Fyke, a Kansas City lawyer,
was among thoue robbed. Mr. hyke gave
a graphic description of the murder of
Mr. Fay. He said:
KAN'S AS CITY, Aug. 5.â The train
reached Kansas City at 7:30 this evening,
over two hours late. Among those who
came through to Kansas City were Mr.
and Mrs. C. P. Duck of Denver. Said Mr.

STORIES OF VICTIMS.
The robbery took place a few minutes
before 1 o'clock this morning. The body
of Fay, who was killed, was taken off at
Jiugo and shipped to Denver. He was C8
years of age and a prominent Odd Fellow
of California. The conductor, who was
compelled to hold a bag while the robbers
relieved the passengers', lost his watch
end asked that it be returned to him in
order that he might run his train on time.
The robbers gave it back. After ransack
ing the coaches the men made the con
ductor pull the bell cord, but the train
wu going so 1 rapidly that ine robbers
Â¦were taken to Hugo before it slowed up
enough to enable them to jump, ihey
compelled the conductor to get- off ahead
of them, so that if any of the passengers
hid been in waiting they would have shot
him lirst. After the robbers had dis
mounted they ordered the conductor to re
turn to his train.
Miss Shaw of Denver, a passenger on the
train arrived in Salina this morning. She

Mr. Goodnow adds that Director of
Posts Sheng had. on the 5th, made to
him an imperial edict dated July 30, order
ing Jung Lu to provide an escort for the
Ministers to Tientsin, when the Ministers
fixed the date. The edict says the Min
isters can receive messages in cipher, but
notwithstanding this plain messages were
returned to some Consuls on August 4.
There are slight differences in the edict
as communicated by Sheng and the mes
sage from the Tsung II Yamen of the same
date, but they are easily reconciled on
the theory that the message from the
Tsung li Yamen was based on the edict.

BESIEGED IX THE CATHOLIC CATHEDRAL AT PEKING.
(From a photograph by Vapereau in L' Illustration.)
Group of bishops and priests of the several nationalities who took refuge
with their converts in the French Catholic Cathedral, Peking, and from whom
nothing definite has been heard except that they were furiously beset and were
ighting for their lives.

From left to right (standing): 1, Pere Brugulere; 2, P. d'Addozio (Italian Lazarist);

Mirr. Scar^Ha (Milan); S, Mtrr. Guillon (French); 9. Zlgr. M. Bernard (Trappist).
Both the message from the Tsung li
Yamen and the edict indicate that the
supreme power in Peking, whatever it
may be, is negotiating with the Ministers
and endeavoring to secure their consent
to go to Tientsin. Administration offi
cials are confident that the Ministers will
not consent, unless they feel that they
will be entirely safe in doing so, and it
is difficult here to understand what as
surances of safety could be given them
that would bo satisfactory. It is believed
they will probably consider themselves
safer in the legations with their small
guards of marines' than under escort of
any Chinese force that might be selected
to accompany them.
The message says nothing about the mes
sages not in cipher being allowed to go
to the Ministers, but the edict, according
to Sheng, expressly allows such messages
to bo sent, though Mr. Goodnow's state
ment that plain messages were returned
to Consuls seems to indicate that it is
doubtful if any communication whatever
with the Ministers will be allowed.
It is the belief of the Cabinet that if.
the Ministers will -Â¦consent they will be
escorted to meet the advancing interna
tional forces, and the Chinese will then
offer to give them up on condition that
the advance shall not proceed to Peking.
It is not believed that the powers will en
ter into any such bargain, but. adopting
Sir. Hay'B expression, will demand the
Ministers as a "matter of absolute right."
On' Sunday night â¢ rockets were seen
from Admiral Seymour's party, and
preparations were made to send a force
to join hands with him. Â¦Â¦.'Â¦'.On Monday.
June 25, the allies commenced, to shell
the . forts, the Terrible'a 12-pounders . do
ing splendid work. The Chinese replied
with eight or nine guns, and this artillery
duel was kept up, the allies covering
thereby the- advance of about 900 men
sent to 'help Admiral j Seymour's force,
which was but nine miles away. The
force got away safely, and next morning
returned in company with the Peking re
lief force. Admiral Seymour : reported
having destroyed the Â¦ Sio Kiu arsenal,
which contained munitions of war to the
value of Â£500,000 - sterling- â¢- In- the- after
noon, Â¦ scarcely, before -the- handshaking
with the returned expedition was over,
the Chinese tort started ;â¢ shelling ;â¢: Tien
tsin'again. A force was sent out to try
and take the arsenal at > the back of the
military Â¦Â¦= school in- the evening. â¢ but It
was obliged to return. The attack was
renewed next morning, June 27. Russians,
British : and Japanese being employed.
The Â¦ Terrible's * guns got' into position
about, 4000; yards from the - arsenal, and
about the first or second shot the Brit

The Â¦ arrival Â¦ of the rescuing party

riddled settlements. Flags were flung to
the breeze, and cheer after cheer given

stamped along. Â¦ ,The > force had two 12
pounders from the Terrible.
On Friday, June 22, firing was kept up
heavily until noon, when it suddenly
ceased. Residents knew then that there
was something up. Some had reported
having* seen searchlights on the night be
fore and heard the booming of distant
guns. Sniping, though, still Went on.
During the night searchlights were seen
throwing, long lines of light across the
sky from a distance. The relief party had
arrived. They came into Tientsin at 3
p. m. on tho afternoon of Saturday. June
23. The soldiers. came in straggling par
ties, having had hard fighting all the
way. A group was carrying James Watts,
the heroic dispatch rider, on their
shoulders. Ho was presented with a
sword' by the Tientsin Volunteers, and
promoted to the rank of lieutenant. It
is understood he is to be recommended to
the Government of some of the allied
powers- for decoration. There were 2300
in all In the relief â British. American.
Russian, German and Italian. The Brit
ish and Americans came up into Tien
tsin from behind the military school, and
the Russians and Germans .from .near
the - railway station. Both columns en
countered seHous fighting, but the Rus
sians and Germans encountered the
toughest opposition, the former losing
heavily.
Then Came the Relief Column.
As. they came nearer a young British
middy got on board two of the craft and
set fire to them. That settled that at
tempt of the enemy. All that afternoon
there was heavy firing and the French
concession, exposed as it was on three
sides, suffered. The secretarv of the
French Municipal Council was killed.
The Cossacks bayonetted or shot
every human being that wore a queue.
The Cossacks have done some of the
hardest fighting around Tientsin, but also
some of the hardest looting. N. J. Sar
gent in his letter says he had reported
the looting of the Cossacks and they were
ordered to keep off that portion of the
bund. Failing to do so, five "were shot.
From the 20th the "allied forces had to
be chary of replying to the enemy's fire
for fear the ammunition would give out.
On the 21st it was found that the Chi
nese troops had mounted two guns on the
opposite side of the river within 1200
yards of the bund. The -uns were across
from the point defended by the volunteers
and the naval people sent down a gun.
Between 6 and 7 p. m. the Chinese guns
across the river were silenced. At 9 p. m.
several junks were seen floating down the
river, evidently wltn the intention of a
bridge being formed for Chinese soldiers
to cross. Fire was opened on them as
they approached and their occupants
driven below.
On Wednesday, June 20. barricades were
erected at .the end of every street and
a guard placed behind them. These bar
ricades were made of bales of wool, bags
of wheat,- rice and other cargo, which
was stored In the different godowns. The
day, though, was nuiet, the Chinese only
firing "Long Tom" at intervals. During
Wednesday night it was decided to send
a messenger to the commanding officers
at Taku, calling for help, and James
AVatts of the Tientsin Volunteers, offered
to carry the dispatches. Three Cossacks
accompanied him. Several times on their
perilous journey they were attacked by
hostile villagers, and they had many per
ilous- adventures, but they managed to
get through the Chinese troops, who were
everywhere about the districts they
passed through. The party returned with
the relief force.
Building the Barricade.
Into the river, thus making the guns use
less. The place was then set on tire and the
allies withdrew. " It burned for an hour J
or two amid constant explosions of car
tridges^. All the rest of the day, until 3
p. m., the guns continued to throw shells
into Tientsin, but aa they were compara
tively high, they did little damage. Tho
shells were 3Vi inch. The big gun was
given several pet names, the most popu
lar one 'being 'â¢Long Tom."
On the 18th of June, next morning, the
bombardment started at 6:20 a. m. and
went on until 6 p. m., the. only Interrup
tion being when the gunners stopped for
dinner.. A '; number of Cossacks went
out and attempted to silence the guns.
They fought the greater part of the day
and came back -in tne evening with 120
killed and wounded. There was, too, that
day some terrific lighting between the
Â¦"Russians holding the railway, station and
the Chinese. 'Had Tit not been -for the
brave 700 Russians and the fight they put
up, holding the thousands of Chinese at
bay on that day, the beseiged city would
have fallen and the beleagured people died
a horrible death.
Ready to Slay "Women and . Children.
The Rev. Charles F. Gammon, superin
tendent of the American Bible Society In
North China, who has reached, Nagasaki
from Tientsin, says that just prior to the
brave tight of the Russians the foreigners
had arranged to kill their women and
children by their own hands, should the
attack of the Chinese carry as they
feared it would, and men had been chosen
by lot to shoot the women and children
should the worst come to pass. The Rus
sians, though, saved the settlements.
They lost heavily, but maintained their
position, although they were so hard
pressed at one time that the question of
retirement was considered. The six-inch
gun of the Chinese at the fort gave them
constant trouble, as their only gun was a
15-pounder of rather antiquated design.
At 10 a. m. the firing was so severe that
the Russian commander sent a message
for help, and a British force was moved
across to support. The hail of shell and
bullets was so steady that the defenders
of the railway station had to lie down
under the platform, so to speak, for pro
tection.
The attack was by regular troops and
evidently well planned, as a smaller body
also attacked the Americans on the Taku
road. Once the American defenders wer.e
driven a bit. Fighting was going on all
along the French bund, the enemy being
in great force along the opposite side of
the river. During the whole afternoon a
terrible wind and dust storm was rag
ing and at night, when the Russians sor
rowfully buried their dead, the rain fell
in torrents.
' The next day the Chinese brought some
guns to bear upon the city from the wall
situated to the eastward. Every time they
fired the British replied with a Maxim
and a nine pounder, which afterward
disabled the enemy's worst gun.

DEVOTIONAL EXERCISES

LAYTONVIULE. Aug. 5.â Deputy Sher
iff, Grubbs, who has been pursuing Mur
derer King, has suddenly started out into
the night with a fresh supply of men and
horses on a clew that required Immediate
action. '
He had temporarily abandoned the chaso
for a day to get much needed rest and a
supply of fresh horses and men. A great
portion of the chase was on foot and soma
of the time through soft, marshy ground.
The trail was lost thirty-five miles north
of Bell Spring Ridge and the officers be
lieve King doubled back. They were pos
itive they had him surrounded Friday
night and spent thirty-six hours trying to
find the trail he took out of the canyon.
Officer Grubb always has his ears open to
catch stray reports that would lead to
anything like a clew, and to-day learned
that King had a brother in law some
where in the vicinity of Cold Creek In
Trinity County, and knowing that he lost
track of King somewhere In that neigh
borhood he now surmises that he will bo
located near there somewhere. Acting on
this supposition he and posse will set
out on the chase, going to Trinity County.
A posse under the leadership of Deputy
Sheriff Redwlne, it is said, is on a hot
trail and has positive evidence that King:
Is hiding in the mountain fastness north of
Covelo. Late Wednesday night King;
passed through Covelo. The night waa
very dark and the following evening he
was* seen crossing a high ridgo twenty
five miles north, by a man named James
Hall. King is accompanied 'by a half
breed Indian named Walter Reed from
Skaggs Springs, who through friendship
for the fugitive is assisting him to escape.
Sheriff Taylor with a posse of picked
men left for the wilds of Anthony Peak
to station men to cover all the numerous
trails that lead to Oregon. Sheriff Taylor
has telegraphed the Sheriffs of Humboldt.
Tehama. Trinity and Shasta Counties to
keep a careful watch out for Church's
slayer, as he will likely head farther
north.
A theory advanced by Sheriff Taylor and
many of the pursuing officers at Covelo
is that King is hiding in the Red Moun
tain country in Trinity. It ia known that
Reed, the half-breed, has friends in that
neighborhood who will assist them with
provisions to sustain life. Still another
theory is that King has substantial
friends In Oregon who came to his rescua
in his former troubles and that Oregon is
the point headed for.

OF SKAGUAY
Discusses the Petition to Rescind the
Privilege Allowed Canadians of
Bonding Goods Through
Yukon Territory.
The effect of such action would be to shut
out all vessels except American in domestic
trade. I am willing to help you to secure an
adjustment of your trade matters, but would
dislike to apply such a drastic remedy as
this.
Make rour statement strong and clear and
I will eee that it reaches the i-iate Department
with my approval. I believe in looking out
tor American shipping and American commerce
first. 1 will say, too, that so far as the Treas
ury Department 1* concerned its disposition is
to serve American interests in every way poÂ»
flble. but there are some things we cannot
do. We are controlled by the laws of Con
gress. A considerable portion of your com
plaint Is In connection with the Canadian regu
lations. That we cannot remedy. I think your
case can be presented at Ottawa in such a way
as to secure relief for your people. I think
your railroad people will help you. As to the
bonding question I have this to say, it is here
in all respects as In other portions of the
country. 1 do not eee how we can change it.
"We can hardly make an exception of this port.
Business will adjust iuelf to conditions.
Sometimes It is not very satisfactory, but we
cannot help that. I can give you no assur
ance that we can change the bonding privileKe.
You must remember that there is a great dif
ference in the American and Canadian method
of administering government. We are bound
by statute, while they have their order in
Council and discretionary powers. If at times
it teems to the people that our Government is
not bs mindful and responsive to the interests
cf the people as the Canadian it must not be
charged to indifference. I do not believe you
want this port closed. It could be done, how
ever, as Dyea was closed, by taking the officers
away.
SEATTLE, Ausr. 5.â The Skaguay Cham

Grant, met the business men of Skaguay

their statements made two suggestions.
The first is that an appeal be made by
the American merchants of Alaska to the

with the Dominion Government gooking
toward reciprocal arrangements. The sec
ond is to abolish the sub-port of Skaguay,
thus closing it to all foreign trade. Skag

Professor Merriman and party have just

paleontological exploration trips ever con
ducted by the State University. The can

field for valuable research. In the upper
strata teeth of mastodon were taken out.
while in the lower levels the skeleton of
a tapir, the only one ever found in that
region; bones of the peccary, rhinoceros
and ancient horse, all rare specimens,
were dug from the solid rock.

a few hundred new fortune seeKers. 'inese
later arrivals are fcr the most part al
ready discouraged, and many, though
they have only been here a few hours, are
already speaking of returning u> their
harpy homes. The most notable event of
recent days has been the arrival of Judge
Arthur H. N'oyes and the other officials
cf the new District Court, v.-ho arrived a
few days ago on thai Senator. As yet they
have done nothing beyond getting things
in ehape to open a temporary term of
court here, but their upixrarance has been i
bo long looiced lor. a* il wm be the de
cisions ot Judge .Noyes that will decide tne
ownership of nearly every claim and bit
of real estate in tne country, that their i
appearance in the community is now the j
one topic of conversation. :
Probably the first thing that the Judge â¢
will do will be to hear a petition request-
IBS the incorporation of a municipality
and to appoint an election ooara of tnree |
members. As every one m town is moie
or less of a politician, and as the control i
of political power means wealth for the i
men who nandle it. every "sour dough" in \
the place is excited over the outcome of ]
election and party leeiuur runs high. The i
che*chacus, or nt-wcoraers, tut but small '.
figure, as a 5ix months* resider.ee is ncces- i
EÂ£ry to Â«iualify one to vote.
The appearance of Judge Noyes is her- '
aided as a blessing because it marks the \
end of incompt-u-ncy that has attended !
the Incumbency of the old commissioner?, j
Ehepard and ijwinehan. The coming of |
the District Court alsu means the end of
military supervision over civil affairs.
CJeneral Randall will henceforth exercise i
no authority except to keep peace and !
order in the place until such a time as a I
complete tryetca of municipal govern- !
roem fha'l have betn t-Mablished.
Incidentally I may say that this matter
cif keepirs the peace is no sinecure. The '
Ftatc^ have st-m Nome as choice a collec
tion of .criminals as ever graced a small i
?<ri(l growing community. Though it is
Ftill lipht enough hÂ»-re v* read a paper at :
midnight, burglary is of daily occurrence.
and highway robbery is rampant. Some
icVa of the bol<liu ss attending the com
mission of these crimes may be had when
It is known that only the night before
last a man was beld up and robbed on
one of the principal thoroughfares of the
town, four gentlemen stated in the win
dow of a house n^-ar by being interested
spectators of the scene. This is only one
of several similar occurrences. Two young
m^n with a fine appreciation of the
fhar.cf? this place affords went into the
tent of a thrifty Swede. Thev beat him
on the head with the butt of a gxin. tied
him hand and foot a:id relieved him of
the care and responsibility of some $350.
All this in broad daylight, with people
walklns pact every few minutes and with
a hundred ncichbors sleeping within a
radius of a couple of hundred feet. A
peml^man living hi a lent was robbed of
a. J22.T sold xvai'h and chain. He bor- ,
rowed a watch ami chain from a friend j
and movfd to annher locality. Tfv first :

Lieutenant D. H. Jarvis to represent it |
here as captain of the port. Lieutenant ]

The problem of the care of the unem

ne a matter of preat Fcriousness during

cause Nome's early history to become a

Â¦MR Â»â¢ HbM Â¦ " ' E " % *â¢ **MThe report of these promotions will recall to the
people the benefits which have accrued to the army by
the reform that opened to the men in the ranks
avenues to advancement. "Under "the old system our
republican army was in its organization one of the
most aristocratic institutions in the world. A private
had as little chance of promotion to high command as
would a similar individual in the armies of Germany
or Russia. Under such circumstances there were few
inducements for men of ambition and intelligence to
enlist. Desertions were frequent, and the general
tone of the army was not* conducive to any real
earnestness or genuine American â¢ sentiment among
the men in the ranks. Very different is the
condition now. . The young soldier sees before
him a means by which he may rise in the army as in
any other "department of American-life, and as a con
sequence recruiting officers are getting into the ranks
"men like those who, by their service and their ex
aminations, have just won their way to honorable
promotion and to a position from which they can
aspire to higher office. .
A RECENT dispatch from Washington an
nounced that the President has appointed
forty-eight enlisted men as second liewtenams
in the regular army and has assigned them to various
branches of service. It is added that all the pro
moted men have gallant records and in their examina
tions attained to high averages. It is, therefore,
reasonable to expect a bright career for each of
them, and possibly a demonstration that in our army
a man may rise from the ranks to the highest com
mand.
PROMOTED FROM THE RANKS.
Looking over the situation as presented this week
it must be admitted that the outlook is rather bullish
than bearish, and that those who believe that there
action from last year has about reached its end have
the best of the argumentâ for the present, at least.
Wall street continues dull. The approaching Presi
dential election, coupled with the Chinese disorder,
tends to imbue the speculative public with caution,
r.nd even dividend-paying bonds and stocks are quiet.
They are not offering very freely, however, being
closely held, and ft is due to this condition that "the
bears find it difficult to depress quotations. The
mor,?y market is featureless, supplies of funds being
ample for all current requirements.
The situation seems to be gradually changing all
around, and whereas buyers have been cautious ever
since the beginning cf the year, it is the sellers now
who are wary about letting go. It is the belief of
many that the shrinkage in values- is about over,
though, as previously remarked, time alone will de
termine whether they are right.
Agricultural products, too, are in much better con
dition. More activity in wool is reported, but quota
tions are a shade lower. The stagnation, however,
seems to be lifted. The hop market, weak and neg
lected for months, is strong. All beef products are
advancing under large demands for the army and
navy, and quotations for live stock are maintained at
their present profitable level. Provisions have lately
developed considerable strength, and quotations for
hams, bacon and lard are higher. Hides and leather,
however, continue depressedi with large stocks. The
cereal markets, taking the country as a whole, arc
weak, though here in California barley, oats and corn
are very firm, with advancing quotations and a good
demand. Wheat is weak and quiet everywhere. Dried
fruits are meeting with a brisk demand, particularly
:n California, owing to the discovery that the output
of all kinds, except apples, will be considerably less
than estimated earlier in the season. Dealers who
have hitherto he'd off for low prices for apricots are
now scurrying about the -country for supplies, but
choice stock is hard to obtain in some sections. The
shrinkage in the prune crop has caused an advanc
cf half a cent per pound in New York, with further
advances not unlikely, as the desirable sizes are re
ported 40 per cent short of last year.
BUSINESS APPARENTLY PICKING UP.
STEADIER indications in several lines of trade
lead some commercial observers to believe that
the bottom of the decline in prices has been
reached, and that with the end of the midsummer
season a reaction will set in. Time will tell. At pres
ent there are few signs of any marked reaction. True,
the decline in iron lias apparently stimulated the de
mand for certain kinds, and it is even said that the
call for iron and steel is as large as ever, though at
lower quotations than ruled last year. The inquiry
is chiefly for finished products and for rails for the
West, though foundry pig iron is reported in better
request. There is a heavy foreign demand for bitumin
ous coal, but in view of the upward tendency in prices
producers hesitate to make contracts for future de
livery. The copper situation also shows more
strength, the exports for July being 10,661 tons,
rgainst 7150 in July, 1899, while the amount coming 1
ir.to sight for home consumption during the last half
of the year is nearly 20,000 tons less than last year.
Thus it will be seen that hard goods are in rather
better shape than they have been.
To those who are indifferent to patriotism and to
business and who have no delights in festivals there 13
nothing to be said; but to all who have the elements
of a genial humanity in them and who sympathize
with American aspirations, as realized in California,
there is this to say: Come up with your coin, and
come up promptly.
to California.
Upon these points it is hardly worth while to dwell
at any length, for they will occur of themselves to
the minds of intelligent men. That which is offered
by the celebration is an opportunity to combine busi
ness and pleasure with patriotism; to advertise Cali
fornia; to quicken trade in San Francisco; to make a
grand holiday not only for ourselves but for thou
sands of visitors, and at the same time demonstrate
to the country at large how much California has
profited by the Union and how much the Union owes
Moreover, the. enterprise has aspects of business as
well as of patriotism. It will benefit the whole State
by advertising the rich variety of Californian resources,
and to San Francisco will bring the additional benefit
of a large influx of visitors, whose presence will stimu
late trade at the beginning of the fall season. The
executive council says: "We expect the celebration
will bring at least 100,000 people into the city, and
over half a million dollars will be left among the
merchants and citizens of the municipality." Â¦ -
The committee has once more reminded the public
that, while the celebration has been undertaken by the
Native Sons, it is not. to. be regarded as an enterprise
p'ertaining exclusively to that society. It concerns
every resident of the commonwealth. The appeal
says': "This is a State celebration, commemorating
the admission of our State into the Union. This must
appeal not. only to men and women born in the State
but to those who have made it their home." That
fact should be borne in mind. The Native Sons are
contributing liberally and promptly themselves to
ward making the occasion one that will have a na
tional reputation for its magnificence, and therefore
have a right to expect a generous and patriotic sup
port from the people generally.
I ;BOM the "executive council of finance of the
I Native Sons there has been issued an appeal
for prompt contributions to the fund for the
celebration of Admission day. To the appeal a cor
dial response should be made. The date of the cele
bration is rapidly approaching, and as the programme
has been planned upon a scale of 'magnitude" arid
splendor never equaled on this coast, there is
no time to spare in making preparations. In fact,
time is about as important as money, so that the citi
zens who intend to contribute to the celebration
should make their contributions at once.

There is no reason apparent to the public why the
enforcement of the health laws in Chinatown should
be shirked by the municipal authorities. Those laws
are enforced in other districts. Property-owners in
other localities have to keep their premises clean and
in good repair. Among the owners of Chinatown
property are some of ihe richest men in the city. Why
are they permitted to ignore the law as if it were
not? Why should the police be set to work to direct
all their energies to ferreting out hidden gambling
dens when the violations of the sanitary laws are so
flagrant that the offenses can not only be seen but
smellcd on every street and alley of the district?
The arrest of a few miserable Chinese wretches is
not going to benefit San Francisco very much, and
it will not improve Chinatown at all. The police
might just as well be sent into the sewers with orders
to arrest microbes one by one. It will be an endless
job to catch fan tan gamblers in Chinatown as it is
now. Clean out a sewer and the microbes will die.
Clean out Chinatown, close up its dirty underground
passageways, put all of its buildings in the condition
that the sanitary regulations of the city require, and
the fan tan business will not be so nourishing.
The people of San Francisco desire to know of the
Board of Health and of Chief of Police Sullivan why
the sanitary ordinances of the city are not enforced
in Chinatown. The petty gamblers who run the fan
tan games are violators of the law and should be pun
ished; but they are not the only offenders in China
town, and, moreover, their offenses ..are. not very
serious menaces to the community. The offenses of
the rich property-owners in Chinatown are serious.
By permitting the violation of the sanitary laws of
the city in that district the municipal officials have
allowed the development there of a veritable cesspool
of corruption, moral as well as physical; and out of
that foulness there have come almost all forms of
evil. The recent quarantine and bubonic scare were
the direct results of the unsanitary condition of the
Chinatown buildings, and they are by no means the
only ill effects of permitting the property-owners to
maintain their premises in such condition.
WITH the change in the Chinatown squad it is
said there is to be a change in the police
methods of dealing with the Chinatown gam
blers. Lottery games and fan tan games are to be
raided. . That will be an ] excellent change, perhaps,
but it will not clean up Chinatown nor. suppress garn
bling there, nor close up the foul secret passages that
afford avenues for crime and vice and disease. It will
not even serve to whitewash the abomination.

itable. % ., ,
This touches the third and most direct
cause of the present outbreak. The
"breaking up" of China, its partition
among European nations, has been freeely
discussed throughout the civilized world,
not to the pleasure or the edification of
the Chinese. "Spheres of Influence" have
been freely laid out on paper by men who
do not know that the true meaning of
"sphere of Influence" is simply "center
of trouble." In commerce and manu
facture the Chinese will hold their own
in any competition. They learn to maks
what they want. They bring in skilled
workmen from the rest of the world as
teachers. They are apt pupils and soon
learn to avoid the outside shipment of raw
material. Even in British Hongkong, as
well as in Singapore and Manila, it is said
that all trade is falling into the hands of
Chinese merchants, who displace the for
eigners by greater attention to business.
Chinese workmen supply most Chinese de
mands more cheaply than any one else
can do It. China is weak, but Chinamen
arc strong, and the future of the tropical
Orient lies In their hands. Even in Si
beria the Chinese gain foothold faster
than Russian influence spreads in China.
China cannot be conquered nor divided nor
retained by outside powers if it is once
awakened and united. Some men foresee
the formation of two strong nationsâMan
churia and Chinaâ Instead of the one now
as a nation headless and irresponsible.
Some concede Tartar Manchuria to Rus
sia, in which case Japan will take Korea,
which she does not want save as part of
the strategy of nations. This Japanese
gentlemen freely concede, but it is felt
Japan will have to do it, as they have
already taken the fractions and unprofit
able island of Formosa. The Japan Mail
thus sums up in striking fashion the poli
tical grievances of China: . .;/
"China has been undergoing a process
of vivisection. Her territories Jaave been
seized on ridiculously flimsy pretexts; her
ports have been rentedâ virtually by force;
concessions for building railways and
working mines have been wrested from
her whether she would or not. She has
been divided up into spheres of Influence
by "Western States as though she were
to quicken her steps. The movement In
: the Orient must come from within. Even
In progressive Japan, European influence
counts for little; European pressure for
next to nothing. The Japanese see some
thing they wantâ a bicycle, a lamp, a
brand of cigarettes or a social custom-
Em' forthwith they take it. Nobody can
force it on them.
The European nations forget sometimes
that jurisdiction and ownership are two
different things. Jurisdiction is costly and
unless It Is in full accord with the will
and the customs of the people over whom
It is exercised It is Ineffective and unprof-
Firstâ The foreign powers must protect
their own legations and citizens against
official weakness and local fanaticism.
This they are doing shoulder to shoulderâ
a fact of which the people of Japan seem
very proud.
Secondâ The foreism powers must not
make this an excuse for the partition of
China. Thl3 la a thing impossible, and
China once roused not all Europe could
furnish the men to conquer the country
or to hold it in check. No foreign power
can maintain an army In the Interior of
North China through a Chinese winter.
If China falls apart it will be through thÂ»
diverging: Interests of north and south.
This is not likely to happen. Sooner or
later, it is believed, the moderate leaders
of the north will come to terms with thej
Viceroys of the south. _>; . :
Thirdâ The European powers, as Ijora
Salisbury has distinctly pointed out. can
not guarantee the- interests of syndicates
dolng^ business under Chinese jurisdiction.
They can protect their citizens under ordi
nary conditions, but they cannot foster
foreign enterprises by a show of force.
Fourthâ It Is for the general interest of
the world to hold China together, to
strengthen her Government so that It can
maintain order at home and dignity
abroad and to treat Chinese peopla
wherever they go Just as similar people*
of other nations should be treated. It doea
not, for example, help our own trade or
relations with China to subject her people
to statutes which apply to Immigrants or
travelers from no other nation. To apply
similar statutes to people of Japan would
be regarded as a national Insult, not to
be forgiven or forgotten, as It wtwld b*
If France or Germany or Italy -were, ex
pressly singled out by name. ThÂ» aÂ»t*
Japanese agitation In San Francisco Is fZ
garded with great surprise and greates
disfavor in Japan.
There is no desire in Japan for war wttH
Russia or any other nation. There is a
feeling that Japan will not again be made
a catspaw for any European combination.
If Russia seizes Manchuria Japan will feel
it her duty to take Korea, a weak. Irre
sponsible and badly governed neighbor.
Every one hopes that the flames of war
will be confined to the region where, they
have been kindled. The powers cannot
be too quick to act In defense of their of
ficial representatives. They cannot be too
careful as to giving fresh cause for fanat
ical outbreaks. -It Is well that the United
States should take an active part In tha
defense of her unoffending citizens at
tacked by an uncontrolled mob. It Is also
well to hold aloof from any European con
cert looking toward political action. For
our notions of treating nations and peo
ple differ somewhat from those current la

In other words, all that Europe can
ever get in China is mines and
roads. ,In general, railways or other en
terprises on a large scale cannot be made
to pay in China. The nature of the peo
ple is such that things have to move
slowly. A little at a time China demands
progress, but not at any breakneck pace,
and not all the Occident can force her
Chinese and they cannot be Ignored or

jelly or a cheese. She has been compelled
to open her doors wide to foreigners of
all complexions, while foreign nations on
their sido close their own in the faca
of her people for reasons as Insulting as
the fact 13 Irksome. We have watched
her suffering all this tamely and timidly
and we have flaunted her for cowardice
and ridiculed her for helplessness."
I may sura up public opinion as It
reaches me In these propositions:
'There will bo no partition of China ex
cept as regards the coast ports. No for
eign nation could afford to conquer or to
administer any Chinese province. There
would be great loss and no possible profit.
All the land above ground belongs to the
More potent toward Immediate trouble
has been the invasion of railway and min
ing engineers, who wander about the
country, often recKless of 'native customs
or prejudices, asking nobody's leave and
heeding nobody's objections. The Chinese
do not want railroads. Still loss will they
consent to have them run through their
grandfathers' graves, and almost every
foot of land Is somebody's graveyard.
They do not like mines, least of all those
conducted by foreign devils In sacred
hills, and they are incensed when samples
of ore are knocked off from their tombs
or their temples. Everywhere are found
agents of syndicates eager to secure con
cessions, often doing nothing with them
save to hold them for future speculation.
This view of the matter may be an un
just ono, and many of these men I know
to be doing honest work In the Interests
of the Chinese people. Still, public opin
ion awards them a large share In the
disturbance of Chinese good feeling. It is,
of course, only through mines and rail
roads that the foreign element can make
money out of China, and these represent
the sole returns which any sort of Eu
ropean jurisdiction could give. Father
Pius Trovarelli, a very intelligent Italian
missionary, says:
The lirst source of trouble, and perhaps
the least. Is found in the work of Chris
tian missionaries. Wisely or unwisely,
some of these put themselves In direct op
position to time-honored but doubtless
very objectionable Chinese customs. To
overthrow theje Is in the minds of the
country folk to destroy the worship of
ancestors, to sap the foundations of Chi
nese morality and in general to wreck
both church and state. The national feel
ing Is weak In China, but the feeling for
ancient customs, the feeling which we call
conscience, bigotry or fanaticism, accord
ing to the way It affects us, is exceedingly
strong. In the south of China the people
prow rich through trade or service with
foreign devils and they have learned the
tolerance which commerce always brings.
In the north bigotry has freor sway. In
view of this a prominent American in
Peking said last winter that "anything
might happen In China and it might come
at any time.'" The time seems to be now.
The causes of the trouble lie, however,
deeper than this. The present outbreak
Is the expression of a dissatisfaction
which has been growing a long time In
the North of China, which -as relations
with the outside world very different from
the trading and wandering people of the
southern ports.
It is alleged that these bands could have
been dispersed at the will of the adminis
tration, but that they have now passed
beyond such control, for the movement
has now behind it a growing feeling of
nationality as well as the intensity of re
ligious prejudice.
It is alleged that the present adminis
tration has entered into an intrigue with
these big knives and has secretly en
couraged them In attacks on Catholic
and other missionaries, on wandering
mining and railway engineers, and on
foreigners in general, Japanese and Amer
icans, as well as German, English and
French. The motto of the Boxers la
said to be "Mleh Yan," "destroy Occi
dentals," and "Pau tschu," "protect
dynasty." The word corrupted as
"Boxer" (tautze, apparently), means
much the same as gladiator, the bearer of
a gladlus or sword. These gladiators are
the leaders of the bands, but the rank and
file of the Boxers are described as being
filled with "village bullies" or rural ma
rauders, a characteristic feature of
Chinese life.
The immediate cause of trouble is the
outbreak of the society called "Boxers."
This is a secret organization, called Ta
Tautze Hul, "the Big Knife Society," its
original purpose being the subversion of
the present Tartar dynasty and the sub
stitution of a native Emperor.
But there are many people in Japan,
Japanese, American and English, who
know something of the conditions in
China, although no one pretends to under
stand the intricacies of Chinese official
Intrigue. I try In this letter to give a
sort of composite of the views of these
people, reserving the right to form opin
ions of my ov,-n later. I have no right
to any yet.

PRESIDENT OF STANFORD UNIVERSITY SUMS UP SENTIMENT IN THE LAND OF THE
MIKADO CONCERNING OCCIDENTAL AGGRESSION IN THE ORIENT.
â¢ It seems clear- that if Eastern men would unite and
stand together on the issue they would win and the
masculine shirt waist would be a proper garb for all
summer purposes and would go in society as well as
in business, in court and at camp meeting. Unfortu
nately, however, there are divisions among them.
Some men declare that no man should wear the re
form garment unless "he has a proper figure, and of
course that would bar out a good many. Thus a New
York clubman declares with the positiveness of one
who speaks with authority: ' "Men who train big on
beer and beef are weighted down by rich deposits of
fat in the, subcutaneous tissue, in the peritoneal folds
and in the great bmentum, and by the abnormal size
of the parenchymatous organs of the abdomen. They
have no hips to speak of, therefore must of necessity
wear suspenders to hold up "their trousers. Such
creatures bring discredit upon the rest of mankind
when they appear in public in their shirtsleeves,
coatless and vestless. They are an offense to gentle
sensibilities, notwithstanding some exhibit Ho
garthian lines of beauty. A proper man as to shape
might successfully do away with the coat and vest in
summer, but his shirt must not open behind, and he
must have no acquaintance of suspenders."
There is a belief among the more sanguine men that
the ladies will eventually relent. Thus the Atlanta
Constitution says: "Surely the women of Atlanta
would not object to a revolution which contains so
much of sense, and the success of which would con
tribute so much to the comfort of the men who have
to serve" the public. Common sense in dress is so
rare an article that it is hard to find it, but when the
ladies themselves Â¦. have won the fight, for the shirt
waist they should permit their brothers' to enjoy the
victory with them." .
The church has been not less tolerant than the
courts. It is reported that at a camp meeting in
Pennsylvania the men in the congregation attended
services without coats or vests, and several of the
preachers preached in their shirtsleeves. With so
much in the way of sanction from business, law and
religion, one would suppose the Eastern man would
go his way and wear a shirt waist, but it seems the
ladies object. From north to south they deny the
right of' a man to wear a shirt waist at any social
function, and thus far they have had their way.
In Cincinnati there has been something in the way
of a judicial decision on the subject, for a Judge of
a Court of Common Pleas in that city is reported to
have said on opening court one warm day: "Gentle
men of the jury, no one believes in maintaining the
dignity of the court more than I do, but in this
weather I think some liberties should be permitted.
Those of you who wish may take your coats off.
And," continued the humane Judge, "for fear there
may be any hesitation, I'll take off my own coat."
The New York Press declares that the shirt waist
movement has been fairly well started in that city.
It says: "Wall street men do not bother about put
ting on a coat or vest when attending to business be
tween io and 3. They go about everywhere in belts
and negligee shirts. In the wholesale dry goods dis
tricts and among the dealers in sporting goods along
Broadway above Duane street men go for a shave, a
drink or a lunch in shirtsleeves and belts."
To the men of San Francisco, rejoicing in the ocean
breezes and wearing overcoats along with their duck
vests and straw hats, these questions may appear but
emanations of the idle chatter of the silly season, but
in'the East they are given serious consideration. In
fact, if we may judge from our exchanges, they con
stitute the hottest topics of talk just now, and there
are signs and symptoms that those who object to
shirt waists for men may yet have to shed their
coats in order to fight for them.
pz; ROM out the sweltering cities and torrid sum-
I mer resorts of the East there has come some
thing like a wail for relief from the burden of
masculine garments/ Seeing the girls serenely cool
and comfortable in shirt waists, men have begun to
ask themselves why they may not dispense with coat
and vest during the summer season and wear shirt
waists like the girls. Why should Mme. Grundy per-'
mit to woman what she denies to man? Why shouid
man submit to her decree? May not a gentleman be
a v gentleman in shirtsleeves, provided the shirt
doesn't button up the back? '

Lively Dancing at the Annual Picnic
of the Itebel Cork Benevo
lent Society.
Fully five thousand friends and mem
bers of the Rebel Cork Benevolent Asso
ciation attended the annual p!cnic of that
organization held yesterday at Shell
Mound Park. The day was an ideaj one
for an outing and was pleasantly spent
by the picnickers. The dancing pavilion
was crowded with moving couples
throughout the afternoon. Excellent mu
sic was rendered by the Iroquols Band
The games were hotly contested and cre
ated a great deal of enthusiasm among
the spectators. Money prizes proved
tempting to the athletic ones and each
event was crowded with entries. It was
late in the afternoon when the last oon
tcst was decided and the committee mem
bers withdrew to rest and refresh them
selves.
Professors McCarthy and McManus
played reels. Jigs and other tripping mu
sic on their pipes. It mattered not to the
clog dancers that the platform sagged in
the middle. Encouraged by the cries of
interested friends, they threw themselves
and capered around in gallant fashion.
Pasmalas, pigeon wings, reels o* Tuloch
and other fascinating steps were indulged
in by those who paid the pipers The
success of the outing was due to the ef

Sacramento â Bartlett Buys
a Yawl.
Yesterday morning the victorious sloop
Aeolus, sailed by "Jack" Short, cruised
along the Sausalito water front looking
for another brush with her defeated an
tagonist, the Gadder, but the Gadder and
her crew of boat-builders had stolen
silently away to Benicia.
Commodore W. N. McCarthy, who sailed
the Gadder to victory last year, said that
he could not understand the Gadder's de
feat by so large a margin as half an hour,
though quite willing to admit that tho
Aeolus was excellently handled and Is a
fast boat. - i
The sloops Thetis, Siren and Raven
cruised up> to Paradise Cove yesterday
and dropped anchor there. Some Corinth
ian boats were moored In that favorite
spot. There was a stiff breeze all day,
and most of the yachts carried reduced
canvas. %

King libeled the Tellus and her cargo on
a salvage claim. Now the owners of. the
Tellus have retaliated by blaming the Bel

The contract for repairing the Tellus has
been let to the Risdon Iron Works and the

LOG RAFT BREAKING UP.
The collier Wellington arrived from
Oyster Harbor yesterday and reports
speaking the tugs Rescue and Tatoosh
sixteen miles north-northwest of Cape
Mendocino. with the log raft in tow. The
raft appeared to be going to pieces at the
bow and big logs were floating out. Should
this Immense mass of lumber go to pieces
the whales as a menace to navigation will
not be in it with the floating piles. Every
year the attempt to tow two or three mil
lion feet of lumber to San Francisco Is
made, and nine times out of ten it fails.
The raft, broken into a thousand frag
ments, is left to float around and endanger
the lives of all who travel up and down
the const. A bill to stop the towing of
these rafts was introduced into Congress
by Senator Perkins, but no action has
been taken on it so far.

San Francisco 15, Stockton 5.
Insistent Mr. Harper of Stockton was
on the Blab yesterday afternoon at Rec
reation grounds and he gave his men
an afternoon of exercise.
Sixteen hits of every description tore
up the crass of the outfield and kept
the nine Stocktonians forever after the
ball that streaked the field.
STOCKTON.
The game was settled in the second in
ning when the local team shot bIi men
over the rubber on four hits. That set
the crowd shouting and hooting, resulting
in a sublime case of "rattles" for the
curve generator from Stockton. Three
rounds removed he received a few more
staggering blows and again the air was
punctured for four hits, five of Hank's
performers stepping the light fantastic
on the home dish. Harper was bo easy
that even Iburg found him twice and
without any effort. To relieve the monot
ony there was an occasional burst of
sharp Infield work that pleased the
crowd. The wa- in which Stocktonians
v.ould bury themselves at the plate after
tome sensational bits of throwing by
Krug and Hildebrand pave Harper chills
and fever and the fanatics great glee.
Iburg didn't prove himself an unadulter
ated wonder yesterday. Eleven times, he
was swatted for safe hits, but they were
not fruitful of runs. The last four in
nings brought runs and hits for the Mill
ers. They could not see Iburg until the
sixth. Then they wreaked vengeance.
The first inninsr was a quiet, formal
party, but the second was a boisterous de
bauch. Reuben Levy started by divorc
ing himself from the running. Then the
noise and tumult began. Krug hit safely,
followed by Reilly for two bags. Iburg
died, but a passed ball scored Krug. Then
Brockhofl walked, as did Hlldebrand, and
all three sack? were packed with Hank's
Importations. This is where Harper went
wrong. He gave Schwartz four not over
and Reilly was forced home. "Brewer"
Pabst swatted the ball to right field, but
Streib dropped it. Brockhoff, Hlldebrand
and Schwarti coming in on the play. Soon
after Sullivan hit to right and Pabst. who
reached third on Streib's error, made run
the sixth. Even Levy, who was twice up
this Inning, hit the ball, but on the fake
play at second Sullivan was caught at the
plate and the boy at the bell was put to
work.
The fifth was such another inning.' Af
ter spreading themselves over the base
lines the Frisco team went to the field
with extra runs registered for Sullivan,
Levy, Krug. Brockhoff and Iburg. The
looal team took no rest even with this
lead and every* time that Stockton made
a run a like number was added to Hank's
string.
In the sixth the MUWs made their first
run. With two outs Streib reached the
initial sack on Krug*s error and third on
Lockhead's two-bagger. Then Courtney
shot a high liner to Schwartz, which went
through him. Streib and Lockhead scor
ing. Again the San Franciscos were at
the stick, scoring Levy and Krug in the
Inning.
The seventh was noteworthy for Stock
ton, because one mar. was sent over the
plate on three hits. For San Francisco
Pabst chopped a fast one along the third
base line for a home run. Both teams
scored in the eighth and Stockton In the
ninth.
This victory places San Francisco second
in the standing. The score:

MORNING GAME.
; Stockton 6, San Francisco 2.
SAM FRANCISCO.
Hanks strlr.g of victories was cut in
two yesterday morning on the Oakland
grounds, where Knell and Whalen were
the rival pitchers, before a fair-sized but
uncnthusiastic and learned crowd of.
Athonias.
The game was one in which the pitchers
figured largely, Whalen twirling In re
markable fashion until the ninth inning,
when the San Franclrcos found him for
two hits. Had it not been for a slice of
luck in this inning the local team would
have been Ehut out. Knell pitched the
best garae since his return to the league.
His bad inning was the eighth, when a
bunch of three "soakers" was rolled out
by the Millers and two men coursed the
bags on that account. Krug at short
played a fast game with many assists.

TOPEKA. Kas., Aug. 5.â According to
the local papers, two Kansas lovers who
have Leen courting the same girl have
wagered their mutual Fweetheart on the
result of the election. The parties to the
bet are James Bradley, Republican, and
Willis Wilkerson. Democrat. Miss Mary
Kir.kaid Is the Ptake.
The girl is said to have approved the
wager and has agreed to abide by the
result. All three interested parties reside
in Dudley Township In Western Kansas.
This is the smallest township in the coun
ty and the most thinly settled. It is the
o^ly townehip in the United State* that
gave a majority fcr Palmer and Buckner
In 1SS6. Only six votes were cast. Of
these Palmer and Buckner received three.
McKinley two and Bryan one. The same
voters still reside In the county and no
more. Bradley axd Wllkerson are two of
the six.
Bradley and Wllkerson have been pay-
Ing attentions to M!fs KinkaJd for some
time. She has treated them impartially
and divided time with them about equal
ly. Both have proposed marriage, but
neither has been accepted because Miss
KinkaJd has been unable to choose be
tween them. They met at Miss Klnkaid's
Â¦ home a frw days ago and Bradley sug
gested that they permit the matter to be
settled by the forthcoming election.
"That would give you too big odds,"
"WllkwBon objected. "The odds now be
ing offered on McKir.ley are about 3 to 1.
Make a proposition on some even beL
For instance, Kansas, and 1 Â¦will take vou
Â¦up."
"Â¦vThy not leave it to Dudley Tovra
â¢Efclp?" Miss KirkP.Id suggested. "If the
township goes Republican 1 will marry
Mr Bradley; if It goes the other way I
will accept Mr. Wilkerson."
This suggestion -was adopted and a com
pact was made. Miss Kinkaid agreeing to
abide by the result. Both men. it is said,
are now out making a vigorous campaign
of the township. Bradley has an advan
tage of one vote to begin with. As there
is no gold Democratic ticket in the field
this year the three Gold Democrats will
decide the b<?L Wllkerson must pet all
three }n order to win, while Bradley ran
make It a tie by simply getting one of
these votes. In the event of a tie Miss
Kinkaid will decide the matter, announc
ing her decision the day following the
election.
The idea of this bet was probably sug
gested by a similar bet made In Kansas
u few days ago in which J. D. Johnson
wagered his daughter on the election of
UcKinley with James Howard, a Demo
crat, who If anxious to marry her and

THE STAKE OF
ELECTION BET
Captain Cane's Greenhall set a fast
pace In the second round of the open
stake at San Mateo Park yesterday and
kept up his winning gait until he had dis
posed of all his opponents, from tne
first slip Greenhall showed fine condition
and in every course ran with great snap.
When he reached the final Greeenhall was
still fresh and lull of speed, his previous
courses seemingly not telling much
against him. This was due to a great ex
tent to his own efforts, Greenhall treat
ing all his opponents alike by putting
thm out of the running in short time.
Kellogg's Kid McCoy was the first dog
to fall a victim to 1 Greenhall's determin
ation to make the final In quick order.
Then Warship, who showed well in the
second round, beating Kegina K, a I to 1
favorite, lost his chances In the stake
to Greenhall. who beat him out without
a point. Olita fared as badly as War
ship. The stake winner got to the front
and when the flag was raised OUto had
not scored. Re-Annex up to the nitn
round had showed considerable speed and
had beaten fast ones in good courses.
Greenhall. however, took his measure, al
lowing him to score two points against
six. Tea Rose, the runner-up, did some
good coursing and put up a hard race In
the final, but Greenhall was in shape to
give the fastest of them an argument and
the best Tea Rose could do was to take
second money.
For Glory In her fast go was beaten
by Mose in a hard race. Mose looked a
likely candidate for honors for a while.
He won a grueling course with Harlean.
Gladys In the third round, but the sever*
work told on him and he was withdrawn.
In the course of St. Helen and Craig
Boy in the second round the hare
reached the escape before the dogs could
score. Craig lioy Jumped the fence and
stirred up a batch of 200 hares. No kill
was scored among the bunch as Craig:
Boy could not determine which one of
the jacks to start for. The hound was
caught and his pleasant dream, was
ended.

at once withdrew and was followed by a
majority of the members from six other
Southern States. The remainder proceed
ed to ballot for candidates. Had the ma
jority rule prevailed Douglas would have
been quickly successful, but fifty-seven
ballots having failed to make a choice un
der the two-thirds rule the convention ad
journed to meet again in Baltimore in
June.
The other faction of the convention also
organized, adopted a platform and ad
journed to meet at Richmond, Va. t In
June. "The party is split forever." said
Alexander H. Stephens. "In less than
twelve months we shall be in a war, and
that the bloodiest In history."
The Constitutional Union Convention.
Before the double-headed Democratic
convention met again to complete its la
labors an effort to save the Union was
made by an assembly of delegates from
the remnants of the old Whig and Amer
ican parties. They gathered at Baltimore
from both sections of the country and
adopted a platform upon which they be
lieved that all who loved their country
would be able to stand. It declared for
the constitution, for the Union, for the
enforcement of the laws as the sole po
litical principles required to carry the na
tion through the alarming exigency.
Feeble as seemed at. the moment, in
the midst of the storm and stress which
racked the land, the utterances of the
mild, conservative, venerable but truly
patriotic gentlemen composing the con
vention, the movement was, after all. of
real value as a restraining force through
the exciting campaign of the autumn.
John Bell of Tennessee, an "American,"
and Edward Everett, an eminent Massa
chusetts Whig, were the nominees.
The Republican Convention.
On the 16th of Way the Republicans
opened their convention In Chicago, with
the author of the historic Wllmot nro
vtso as temporary chairman. There were
4G6 delegates; six slave States were repre
sented.
The platform reasserted the princlnlea
of the declaration of independence: eulo
gized the Union; exalted the rights o*
the Stages: denounced the John Brown
invasion; denounced the existing admin
istration for the attempted Lecompton
fraud: deprecated tha re-establlshsient of
the slave trade: exposed the deceptive
and fraudulent doctrine of popular sover
eignty; denied the' existence of any au
thority whatsoever which could make
slavery legal in any Territory; demanded

disaffected faction. But the remainder of
the nominating body was not even yet
united. The convention had met to nomi
nate Douglas, and it seemed that it
might not be able to overcome the opposi
tion to him. Douglas, seeing the difficulty,
wrote an earnest, sincere and manly let
ter, begging the convention to sacrifice
his candidacy if the interests of the party
and the Union required it. The letter was
suppressed, and Douglas, having: finally
received all but thirteen votes of the re
duced convention, was declared Its candi

The seceders from the Baltimore con

The Election.
The four Presidential tickets having
been fully launched, the most memorable
campaign of our history was inaugurated
One sole question was involved. It was a
fight for union or disunion. In the North
though many votes were cast for Breck
inrldge and Bell, the real contest was be
tween Lincoln and Douglas. Breckinridgo
represented the secession element; but
many who voted for him were Union men
The South cast more than 500,000 votes for
Bell and over 160,000 for Douglas, while
Lincoln received 26,430. There was far
from being any overwhelming secession
sentiment in the slave States. Breckin
ridge. as the only candidate appealing to
that sentiment, lacked 135.037 of a major
ity in the slave States. Douglas received
a large popular vote throughout the coun
tryâsecond only to that of Lincolnâ but
actually carried only the single State of
Missouri.
A strong effort was made in the North,
and especially In New York, to fuse all
the elements of opposition and effect the
defeat of Lincoln. But in spite of politi
cal scheming every free State, New Jer
sey alone excepted. gave overwhelming
Republican majorities. "Insuring Lincoln
ISO Eleotoral votes. Douglas gained only
12 Electoral votes, Bell 33 and Breckln
ridge 72.
The election was an unusually quiet one.
No disturbance occurred at the polls.
Voters were oppressed with a sense of
the seriousness, the solemnity of the cri
sis and the momentous results to be ex
pected from their choice. There was no
possible question as to the decision at the
ballot box. The vote had been fair and
honest, and Lincoln was the chotce of
the people over any other candidate. He
had not. Indeed, a majority of Uie pop
ular vote, but he had three times the
votes of Bell, more than double those of
Brecklnridge and 566.036 more than Doug
las. The North was now at last united
and determined and calmly faced the an
gry South, waiting for the next move
upon the gigantic chessboard. For weeks
before the election the Southern newspa
pers had constantly proclaimed that se
cession would follow a "black Repub
lican" triumph. . Now we should see*
whether this -was but ante-election blus
ter. It was clear that many of the South
ern leaders shrank from the responsibility
of the fatal step. Earnest lovers of their
country as well as of their States. Uka
Alexander H. Stephens, strove with all
the energy of their being to stem the ris
ing torrent of disloyalty. Fiery South
Carolina, so long indoctrinated by her
great Calhonn, was first to act. She

balloting the convention adopted the two
thirds rule for nominations and formu
lated a platform.
The ., thirty-three members of the com
mittee on resolutions (one from each
State) were from the first irreconcilably
divided as adherents of Douglas or of
Jefferson Davis. A previous caucus of the
Southern members had committed them
to the position taken by Davis in his Sen
ate resolutions. On the fifth day a divided
report was made. A bare majority report
ed a platform declaring that neither Con
gress nor any Territorial Legislature
could legislate In any manner whatever
detrimental to the rteht of property In
slaves; and that the Federal Government
was bound to protect that right on Fed
eral territory-
Sixteen members of the committee pre
sented a minority report which upheld the
principle of popular sovereignty and
Pledged the party to support the Dred
cott decision or any future declarations
of the Supreme Court respecting the
rights of property In any part of the
Union. Both reports professed to stand by
the Cincinnati platform, upon which
Buchanan was nominated In 1S56; both de
manded the annexation of Cuba and the
support of the fugitive slave law.
After an exciting discussion, in which
the ablest and most eloquent members
from the two sections made earnest and
impressive speeches, the convention
adopted the minority report of the Doug

members from slave States voting with
the majority. The Alabama delegation

MRS. ROBERT L. KELLY (NEE CALLAHAT*).
OAKLAND, Aug. 5.â News of the wedding at Stockton of Miss Nellie
Callahan of this city and Captain Robert L. Kelly, a well-known steam
ship man, has been made public, much to the surorise of even the
Oakland relatives of the young lady. The first intimation of the mar
riage was given by the charming young bride, when, after a month had
passed, she returned to this city with her husband and introduced him in
his new relation to her family.
Miss Callahan, the young lady, left her home at Twenty-third and
West streets ostensibly to visit friends at Stockton. There she met Cap
tain Kelly, to whom she had been engaged for several months, and the wed
ding was so quietly celebrated that it remained for their personal announce
ment to Inform the relatives and friends here. Mrs. Kellv does not admit
there was an elcpement. Her relatives, however, were so greatly surprised
that they were inclined to believe the young woman had romantic ideas
concerning marriage.
The bride is a member of a pioneer family of this city. She Is a sister of
Mrs. Lea Andrews, who resides at 838 Isabella street. The happy husband
was for many years connected with San Joaquln River navigation. He has re
cently taken a position on one of the China mail steamers.
Charles F. Burgman Lectures Before
First Mental Science Temple
at Golden Gate Hall.
Two interesting lectures were delivered
yesterday in Golden Gate Hall by Charles
F. Burgman before the First Mental Sci
ence Temple of this city. Mr. Burgman
is secretary of the home organization of
mental science at Sea Breeze, Florida,
and is touring the United States in the in
terest of that cult. His lecture in the
evening was on the subject, "Chemistry
of the Emotions, or the Healing Power of
Thought. " Mr. Burgman held that the
mind trained to a knowledge of its own
power can cure every form of disease and
that the potency of right thinking has
never been measured.
"There are divine, attributes," concluded
Mr. Burgman, "from higher realms en
tering into it that are of themselves so
elevating and ennobling and so positive to
the lower conditions wherein disease and
misfortune and inharmony lurk that there
is nothing too great to expect from a con
tact with it. This is true to such an ex
tent that people in all walks of life are
putting their strongest faith in It and ad
vocating its efficacy above that of all
other systems of healing."
The lecture was illustrated with fine
stereopticon views of Sea Breeze, the
home of Helen Wilmas (Colonel C. C.
Post), the great apostle of mental sci
ence. In the morning Mr. Burgman gave
an interesting, discourse on "Mental Evo
lution." Musical selections were rendered
under the direction of Mrs. Marriner-
Campbell by Mrs. ' Louise Wright Mc-
Clure, Miss Margaret Magulre, Miss Edna
Smart and Mrs. W. J. Batchelder. '
James Purcell, a recently discharged

with the request that if anything hap
pened to him it be sent to Brooklyn, N.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEWPORT. Aug. 5.â Mr. and Mrs. "Wil
lie K. Vanderbllt Jr. had a narrow escape
from death last evening. They were re
turning home in their locomobile and were
riding at a good gait down Bellevue ave
nue. At the end o< the avenue is a sharp
turn. Mr. Vandhrbilt veered quickly
around the corner and ran upon a fash
ionable turnout drawn by a sparr of high
steppers. It looked as though a collision
were inevitable, but Mr. Vanderbilt
brought the machine to a sudden stand
still. At the same time the horses reared
up.' pawing the air excitedly. The driver
saw that he must keep the horses in the
air until Mr. Vanderbilt could back out
from under them.
Mr. Vanderbilt soon had the machine
at a safe distance, but none too soon, as
he had hardly got from under the horses
when they came to earth. Mrs. Vander
bilt fainted, but was taken to a cottage
and soon revived.
IMPORTANT CONCESSION
FOR AMERICAN FRUITS
New Commercial Treaty With Ger
many Removes the Inspection
for San Jose Scale.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. Aug. 5.â American fruit
growers obtain an important concession
in the new commercial agreement between
the United States and Germany. The lat
ter annuls tho regulations providing that
dried and evaporated fruits imported from
the United States be inspected on account
of the San Jose scale and agrees that
such fruits shall be admitted without
other charges than the regular customs
duty.
This is regarded as a practical admission
by the German Government that the or
iginal restrictions placed upon the Amer
ican fruits were really nothing more than
deliberate discrimination.

The Charleston Convention.
The national Democratic nominating
convention met in April at Charleston, S.
C:, every State in the Lnlon sending dele
gates. It was the tlrst of the great parts
gatherings of this fateful year; and for
the first time a Presidential convention
was held in the far South and in a State
where slavery had developed a predomin
ating influence over all other elements in
social, political and industrial life. In
Charleston there existed at that time more
of the spirit cf .aristocratic arrogance
than was seen in any other city of the
land. Northern delegates to the conven
tion, most of whom were brought for the
first time into close contact with Southern
society, and especially with the most cher
ished Southern Institution, were deeply
affected by what they saw; while the
treatment which they received from the
rich and haughty Carolinians In their own
home showed them how little there was
in common between Northern and South
ern Democrats.
The 600 delegates represented the best
elements in tha party. They were men of
Intelligence and of high standing in their
several States and they deeply felt the
seriousness of the crisis and the import
ance of the action which they were about
to take. Caleb Cushing of Massachusetts
presided and before proceeding to the
ti.e admission of Kansa3, the adoption of
a protective policy (thin secured tha ad
herence of .Pennsylvania) and the passage
of a homestead law, while any change in
the naturalizatoin laws was opposed. The
omissions of the platform, as well aa Its
declarations, were aignlflcant and politic,
and It was adopted amid great enthusi
asm. Seward was the most prominent of
the party lrndera, and It was believed
that he would be nominated on the first
ballot. But Seward whs a man of too
pronounced views and too determined

AMERICAN POLITICAL FÂ»ARTIES.
THE CAMPAIGN OF 1860.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
OMAHA. Nebr., Aug. 5.â From all
sources come reports of unprecedented
prosperity throughout the Middle West.
Farmers are selling their hogs at i% cents,
whereas, four years ago they could get
but ZVz cents, and the high prtce3 of wheat
and cattle that have prevailed for two
or three years are enabling the farmers of
Nebraska and South Dakota to pay their
debts and to accumulate money. Rail
road agents report that there are more
pianos and fine top buggies being pur
chased by farmers this summer than ever
before in the history of the State. The
jobbing houses of Lincoln, Omaha and
Sioux City which sell the bulk of goods
between the Kansas line and the Black
Hill3 report an enormous Increase cf
sales. There has been all the way from
40 to 100 per cent increase in the volume
of trade, with collections all that could be
desired. One house, wholesale hardware,
has established two branch houses during
the last three years and all are growing
rapidly. The Union Pacific Railway has
sold more land during the last two years
than for fifteen years previously and Wy
oming sheep men aretiow negotiating for
a million acres in the Red Desert country.
The railroad situation west of the Mis
souri River is brighter than ever. All
roads can scarcely handle the traffic.
Four years ago the Union Pacific Railway
had 125 idle locomotives in the round
houses: now the road cannot move all the
freight offered with its increased capacity
and every wheel is moving. Similar con
ditions are to be found on the Burlington
and Xorthwestern roads, whose trunk
lines traverse Nebraska.

SECRET FOR A MONTH
rk s a result of the announcement made by County Clerk Frank
* * C. Jordan that he would issue 15.0C0 registration certifi
cates for use at the approaching Congressional primary Supervi
sor W. H. Church last evening found thirty clerks who had been
sworn in as county deputies work in the County Clerk's of
fice sending out these certificates accompanied by Dalton litera
ture.
Supervisor Church charged County Clerk Jordan -with using
his office for partisan political purposes. The County Clerk met
this with a statement that he was doing this to further the inter
ests of the voters of Alameda County, but the Supervisor found
that with every certificate was being sent a Dalton circular. Su
pervisor Church lodged u protest against the use of a public office
for private campaign purposes and threatened the County Clerk
with Supervisorial and Grand Jury action.
OAKLAND, Aug. 5.-County Clerb

When Church ente/b the busy hive of
workers he at once av r sLed County Clerk
Jordan: M â¢_Â£"Â¦Â«
"What does this rÂ£*'*n~ asked Super
visor Church. >/
"it means that I I pi getting out the
Â¦work of my office." Spiled Jordan.
"You mean that Jfcu are getting out
work for DaJtor. " jatorted Church with
fnmc heat. "I wanf to know what you
are doing. As a co&'y officer 1 have a
rieht to kr.ow. YoÂ» arc doing crooked
wr.rk here and you know It. You have
b'-on using rour cfÂ»c*> for politics too
icr.K. I would like ;o know wlio is going
to pay for the?? !:;hts. I will have you
up tÂ«>for*- the Gnnd Jury."
"I have been thtre once already." re-
trrted Jordan. "As for the light?. I am
willing to pay for them. This work that
I am Â«loi:iR. tbosgrb. Is partly for the
county. Wii^n it comos to doing politics,
i n .i set off.
Church ir?'.5trfl that the largw force of
rr.cn in s-isht wore not countv deputies.
Jordan d< !ared they wore, ihen it de
veloped t!;:it t<>n minutes before Super
wisor <.'>u:rch arrived nt the Clerk's of
fice Jordan had sworn in all of the force
at work on The folders as Deputy County
CWks.
In explanation of hts move Supervisor
Church paid:
"I made a protest against any partisan
politics being done in the office of the
County Cl*>rk. Is the county to pay for
the gas which is beincf consumed In that
office night after night? I do not care in
whose interests this sort of thing is being
done. I say now that the County Clerk
has no right to thus use his office, and
as a member of the Board of Supervisors
I lodge a protect in their behalf."
County Clerk Jordan sent for George W.
T?akor. his attorney, and then made the
following statement:
"This work Is In part county work.
These men as my deputies are getting out
notifications to voters and are incidentally
Finding out this folder in the interests of
Henry Dalton. I am Dalton's friend and
I am doing all I can to further his candi
dacy. 1 pay now that no stationery, post
age or help is being paid for by the coun
ty. The gas would be lighted any way,
because we would be working at night
on the register. This is my office and I
shall put in 100 men here if I deem it nec
essary.
"What I am doing will assist the voter
and I consider that it is of as great Â»inport
ance as any other work which I can do
now toward giving the public a clean reg
ister."
The Metcalf managers declare that they
want evfry member of the Republican
party to vote at the coming primary. They
oo not want Dalton men only to vote, anil
they take the stand that the County Clerk
should not become such an ardent partisan
If he does not expect to have charges
made against him.
Want a Fair Deal.
. "We don't want to deprive a single
honest Republican of his vote, whetner
he is for Metcalf or for Dalton," said
Emil Nusbaumer, who is one of tjbc
active supporters of Victor H. Metcaff.
"â¢But we don't want a lot of Democrats
and Populists to vote at the Republican
primary. We want a Councilman from
this district who is reall'- a Republican,
and not one who is satisfactory to the
Democrats and Populists. A man who is
satisfactory to th*Â»m is not satisfactory
to the Republican party. We do not want
a lot of people who have been fighting
our party, and who would only vote at
its primary in order to wreck the party
to vote at this primary. If a man is a
Republican and wants to vote for Mr
Dalton he will have no opposition from
any Metcalf men. but Populists and
Democrats are not going to vote if we
can help it.
"Ae far as the Metealf side is concerned
Mr. Jordan may Issue his certificates,
and if the men are entitled to vote at a
Republican primary they will vote with
out opposition from us, and if they are
not so entitled they won't vote if we can
help It."
This is t^ft last week of the struggle
and it is going to be a bitter one.

dian, who with Harry Bulger is winning
smiles from audiences at the California

to the audience.
The pretty tot is a universal favorite
with the members of the "all-star" ag
gregation and they, wishing to show their
appreciation for her, contributed to a
fund which was used In buying the hand

on the stage along with the Japanese
maids of the chorus she attracted marked
attention by her cute movements, and
when Manager Dunne, in behalf of the
company, presented the token to the lit
tle maid Â¦ the audience expressed its ap
proval with hearty applause. Sherrie

ly feeling shown his little girl and tried
to hide his pleasure by kissing her. The
scene was quickly over and was consider
ed the most charming of the production.

Two Accused Food Inspectors Antici
pate the Action of the Board
of Health.
The two food inspectors. John Tracy
and Joseph Lahcny. who have been under
investigation by the Board of Health for
eevera: days past, sent in their resigna
tions Saturday to take effect to-day. The
rcfignatlons have been accepted. The two
officials forestalled the decision of the
board to dismiss them becau8e of certain
irregularities. Both men hitherto had
borne pood reputations, but charges were
made by Health Officer O.'Brien that they
had made reports of condemnation of food
which never took place. It was also dis
covered that no convictions for violations
of the pure food law have been obtained
for some time past.
When the charges were made about one
wÂ«k ago the two Inppectors were tus
pended pendir.R an investigation, which
was referred to the committee on labora
tories and food inspection, of which Dr.
Bazct 5s chairman. The committee met
fcaturday evening and the members were
dcsetÂ«i together for over an hour. The
two inspectors who are under fire waited
patiently outside In the corridor, and evi
dently believlnc that the' long discussion
â¢would result in unfavorable action con
cluded to file i heir resignations, and the
secret region came to an abrupt end.

TEAMSTERS ENJOY A
DAY IN THE COUNTRY
w w AHILE proceeding to shoot what he though was
1 I I a cat, Coy Boyd, a young man with a borrowed
\JiJ rifle, painfully wounded John McKenzie, an in
mate of the Almshouse. as he was peacefully
reading a paper yesterday.
The boy Is about 15 years old. Ho lives at 204 San
Jose avenue with , his stepfather. A. Waldler, a milk
man. Yesterday morning Coy, his two brothers and a
neighbor's son, took one of Waldier's wagons and started
on a hunting trip, their arms being a 22-callber rifle bor
rowed from a boy named Hintz. They drove to the Lake
Honda district and for some hours hunted for squirrels.
Coy was the sportsman, while the other two boys rounded
up the game and retrieved whenever anything was killed.
Three squirrels was the bag when the boys tired of
' their hunt and started for home.
There were more cartridges,^however, and the boys
were unwilling to bring any home unused, so fence posts,
sign posts, dogs and cats suffered all along the road from
Lake Honda to where they ran across McKenzie reading
his paper. They had just reached the crossroads near the
Almshouse when Coy saw what they took to be a cat
sitting upon a rock, placidly washing her face with a
right forepaw. The rocks were in the corner of a corn
patch in a good light and with, a good background, and
it looked a sure hit. Coy got down from the wagon* and
approaching within fifty yards he cautiously drew a
bead on the supposed cat and fired.
It was not a cat, however. It was McKenzIe's gray
head that looked so like a cat's back, and. the nodding
corner of the paper he was reading, to the excited Imagin
ation of the boys, did duty for a busy, cleanly forepaw.
It was a very low shot, luckily, or the result might have
been very serious. It was bad enough as it was, for the
bullet struck McKenzie in the jaw, breaking It in its.
passage, and lodged in the root of his tongue. 'Â¦{Â¦(:.
As soon as he was hit he dropped his paper and
started for the boys, but Coy scrambled back into the
wagon and they drove off. McKenzie hurried to the
Almshouse, where Dr. \V. E. Conlan extracted the bullet
and dressed the wound.
The police were notified and Detectives Hayes and
Feeney were detailed on the case. They arrested Coy and
took the rifle, and he was locked up on a charge of as
sault with a deadly weapon. He was released on $10 bail.
He was more concerned about the rifle, which he feared
would be- confiscated, than he was about McKenzie's
condition, j â¢.:â¢-* f^-'-'r^Jr ..'
FOR the first time in years Policeman Daniel Lyons
left the hammer of his revolver resting on a loaded
cartridge yesterday, and as if waiting for the chance
the weapon fell from his pocket and shot him in the
leg.
Lyons was on the run after lotterymen in Chinatown
when the accident happened, and his revolver fell on the
cobblestones of Jackson street. It had always been hia
custom to let the hammer down on an empty chamber, but
he had only recently returned from a vacation and his re
volver was in the same condition as it was when he came,
home. He had the weapon with him in the country to
practice target shooting, and he got in the habit of load
ing the cylinder full. When he went back to duty he
neglected to leave an empty chamber opposite the ham
mer and the revolver was ready to take advantage of
the fall when it came.
Lyons and Policeman Brady were watching the oper
ations of a lottery ticket marker In a room at S22 Jack
eon street. They were on the roof of S25, across the
street, when they saw him marking a ticket, bo they
went down to the doorway of i23 to watch for some onÂ©
to go in. A Chinese entered the place soon after they
took, their stand in the doorway, and after giving hftn a
few moments' grace they started over to catch the man
either in the act of having the ticket marked or as he
was receiving It from the marker. As they did not want
a warning to get there ahead of them they ran as fast
as they could, Lyons leading and Brady a few feet be
hind him. It was just in the middle of the street that
the revolver, shaken out of Lyons' hip pocket by his
exertions, fell on the pavement and was discharged.
The bullet struck Lyons in the left leg about two
inches above the ankle. It drove clean through the bone
and lodged under the skin on the other side, making a
painful wound, and one that disabled the officer, but
which will heal in a few weeks and leave him as well
as ever. Had the bone been shattered it would havo
been a serious hurt, but the hole was drilled so cleanly
through that the Injury does not amount to so serious
a matter as a fracture.
Lyons was sent to St. Mary's Hospital, where he will
remain until again fit for duty. He was onÂ© of the new
Chinatown squad under Sergeant McManus. He has
been on the force for eight or nirio years and never had
an accident befall him before. He has been known as a
very careful officer. . Â¦Â¦*
PBINCIPAXS AND INCIDENTS IN TWO SUNDAY ACCIDENTS.
Delivers an Interesting Lecture Be
fore the Ethical Institute in
metropolitan Hall. r
The Sunday evening lectures under the
auspices of the Ethical Institute were re
sumed at Metropolitan Temple last night
â¢when Benjamin Kay Mills delivered an
address on "Who Is the Infidel?"
Mr. Mills said that one reason why we
cannot define infidelity, which, from its
verj- form is eoiBetninf? of a negation. Is
because we cannot define orthodoxy. He
held that a creed is valuable as an In
dication of the thought of the people at
the time it was written â it is exceedingly
valuable as a matter of history â but the
Â¦world moves on and the things that used
To be accepted and rightly accepted are to
be locked on now as we look upon the
antiquated vehicles in which our an
cestors used to travel.
"Those who are true believers', " safd
Mr. Mills, "at the close of the nineteenth
century are sometimes called by the
thoughtless by the name of infldelÂ«. but
if we, who -write on our banners no words
except freedom, truth, progress and love,
nre infidels, how shall we define believers?
If to allirm th" fall of man and the ruin
of the race; if to conpig:n the heathen and
two-thirds of the inhabitants of Chris
tendom to eternal torture; If to announce
That God has only once revealed himself
to men and then only to a limited few;
if to teach that only one way of escape
from perdition is by a credulous gym
nastic of intellect, impossible to a vast
majority of the human race, then let us
glory in inndelitv."

Funeral of Captain Frederick Jerome.
Honored as a Hero in England
and America.
The remains of Captain Frederick Je
rome, seaman and hero, were laid to rest
yesterday in Odd Fellows' Cemetery. The
funeral was conducted by the California
Society of Pioneers. The services held at
Pioneer Hall were, at the request of the
dead mail, simple. A touching sermon
was delivered over the remains by Rev.
S. H. Willey, chaplain of the California
Pioneeers. The ritual of the Pioneers
was the service used. The Masonic
Quartet rendered several selections.
Captain Frederick Jerome had an en
viable record for bravery and daring acts
of heroism. He was presented with the
freedom of the city of New York and an
elegant dnuff-box for saving lives in the
wrecks of the Henry Clay and Ocean
Monarch in the year 1S46 and 1S4S. Cap
tain Jerome also saved the lives of the
captain of the Lucky Star and his wife
and children, who were wrecked on the
coast of Formosa in 1SC2. He was espe-i
daliy honored by a present from Queen
Victoria for his heroism in the British
channel. He was presented with a gold
medal by the city of Liverpool, and was
made a life member of the Pioneer So
ciety of California by unanimous vote.
Captain Jerome has also saved many lives
in the bay of San Francisco and was in
consequence well known and beloved here.

The sermon was preached by the Rev.
James It. Newell, O. P. He dwelt at length
on the life of the saint. He compared the
elforts of the founder of the order of the
Jesuits to the zeal of Luther, who lived in
the same period. The reverend father

death there were over one thousand mem
bers in the "order and over one hundred
thousand people receiving instruction.

natius and accordingly the attendance by
the members at the mass was very large.
At the vespers and benediction service
in the evening the Rev. Frieden, S. J., also
officiated. The sermon was preached by
tho Rev. Donald McKinnon, S. J. The

â¢â¢Magnificat," Cagllero; Allegro from Han
del s "First Organ Concerto," by Dr. Mau
rice W. O'Connell.
Solemn high mass was celebrated by the

o'clock. He was assisted by the Rev.
Richard Bell. S. J., and Charles F. Car

spectively. A special musical programme
had been arranged for the occasion.

After Calnari had jumped his bonds
rather than take a chance of spending a
long term in State's prison, two detectives
visited his home and unearthed thÂ«Â»
stolen boots. They were at once returned
to Captain Gillin, who requested that thÂ«Â»
matter be kept quiet.
The police are row satisfied that Calnan,
after being released on bonds. Tvas put
aboard a deep-water vessel by his friends,
who were determined to save him from
the disgrace of being compelled to wear
Ftripes. To-morrow night the Police Com
missioners will hear evidence in the Mc
llillan case and then formally dismiss
Cainan from the department.
With brazen effrontery Calnan ques
tioned every member of the station about
the disappearance of the boots, and after
a. pretended investigation, lasting over a
week, he reported to Olllin that he had
been unable to locate the thief. All this
time the stolen footgear was in the base
ment of his home.
In order to shield himself Calnan at
tempted to cast -suspicion on an officer
Â¦who has grown gTay in the service and
â¢whose refutation for honesty has long
l>een established. Captain Gillin refused
to believe that the orticer was guilty of
â¢Â¦MeaJir.g- his boots, but not to discourage
Cainan he ordered him to make a further
investigation.
Since the hurried departure of Police
man Calnan from the State to escape
prosecution 'or stealing a horse from a
man named McMillan many additional
'thefts oorarniued by the policeman have
con-.e to lijErht. One of the most amusing
vas the pilfering: of a pair of riding boots
'from Captain Gillin. his commanding o*
Â¦ iicer. Gillin had purchased the boots only
a short time before, and after proudly
showi:i& them to his subordinates he
placed them in his locker at the Saven
<Â«Â«inth-strtt;t Ftation. The following day
he went to get the boots and was sur
prised to find them sor.e. Calling in Cal
'nau, who was then acting as sergeant, he
1 Informed him of the theft of the boots and
vrjerod him to make a. thorough invest i
j nation. Oaln;in expressed surprise that
| any one should have the audacity to rob
the captain's locker, and with many ex
pressions of regret for the loss of the
â¢boots he swore to land the thief or die
"in the attempt.
