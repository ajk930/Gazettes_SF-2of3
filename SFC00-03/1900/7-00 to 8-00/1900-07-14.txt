him to be placed In the hands of Minister

Wu determined to act through the
medium of an Influential Imperial officer
at Shanghai, who, by reason of his
position, is better able than any one el?o
in China to execute such a mission. Be

Conger. Wu sent to the Chinese official
a detailed and urgent explanatory mes

official was urged to spare no effort or
expense In forwarding the message by
couriers, runners or any other means. In

Shanghai to Peking, surrounded by such
safeguards and such efforts for speed that
a reasonably early answer may be expect

that it took ten days for China's official
decree to get from Peking to Washing

to accomplish this task at the earliest

Chinese Minister at Washington Aiding
. the Secretary of State in an Effort to
Establish Communication With Peking.
WASHINGTON. July 13.â The
Chinese Minister, Mr. Wu. has
undertaken to get through a
cipher cable message from
Secretary Hay to United
States Minister Conger at Peking and to
deliver back the reply of Minister Con
ger, If he be alive. Wu forwarded the
cipher dispatch, together with an extend
ed explanatory message of his own, on
Wednesday and the results are now being
eagerly awaited both by Secretary Hay
and the Chinese Minister, although It is
appreciated that some days must elapse
before runners can carry out this plan of
opening up communication between the
American Government at "Washington
and the American Minister at Peking.
It was soon after Minister Wu present
ed the text of the edict Issued by the
Chinese Imperial Government that Mr.
Hay requested him to get through a mes
sage to Mr. Conger. Since the Chinese
Government succeeded in getting through
Its own communication from Peking. Mr.
Hay felt that It was quite reasonable to
ask that liks communication be opened
between our Minister and the Govern
ment here.
Wu readily assented to this proposition
and evinced an earnest desire to use all
his personal influence in getting through
the message.. He suggested, however,
that Mr. Hay himself should write the
message in cipher, as this would be proof
positive to Mr. Conger of its genuineness,
whereas any open message to the Minis
ter might be open to suspicion of having
emanated from the Boxers. Mr. Hay

June 17, ard sent overland. In which
all the Governors were urged to dispatch
troops with the utmost speed to help

Tuan was clearly indicated. Acting on
this edict, which is said to be undoubted

was during a conterence the Minister had with Secretary
Hay on Wednesday that the suggestion was made that it would
be advisable for the department to prepare a cipher dispatch and
intrust it to the Minister for transmission, if possible, to Peking.
When asked to-night if he had received any reply, Wu said he
had not, nor does he expect an answer for some days.
It is apparent to the State Department that Li Hung
Chang does not propose to proceed to Peking, though he has
been strongly urged by the powers to do so. Scgne days ago the
department offered to convey him by the cruiser Brooklyn to
Taku. Li Hung Chang could not go north at that time, the
orders to Admiral Remey to proceed to Taku were imperative,
and the Princeton was then sent to Canton to receive, him. But
Li was still unwilling or unable to leave, and the Princeton, be
ing needed in the north,' had to leave yesterday and arrived to
day at Hongkong.
A dispatch was received to-day from Consul Me Wade at
Canton stating that "Li Hung Chang has engaged quar
ters upon the Chinese steamer Ah Ping, but the date of his de
parture for the north is as yet undecided."
Li Hung Chang probably appreciates the fruitlessness of
his going to Peking and the inadvisability of placing himself in
the power of his enemies who are in control.

State Department to-day the depressing information that the
''final attack" on the legations had been arranged for July 7
This statement was made public at the State Department rela
tive to the contents of Mr. Goodnow's message.
Minister Wu is extremely anxious for the allied troops to
start for Peking. ' For several weeks past he has been urging
upon this Government and representatives of other powers to
have the allies commence their march on the capital. Mad
prompt action been taken he is satisfied that the Ministers by
now would be safe. The Minister docs not like to openly criti
cize the foreign governments, but he thinks if they would go as
quickly as possibly to the assistance of the imperial government
in Peking it would be much more sensible than to prolong the
discussion which has been in progress. The Minister also be
lieves that the troops now at Taku and Tientsin are sufficient to
force their way to the capital and occupy it. While he is pre
serving a hopeful demeanor, he is as much in the dark regard
ing the true situation of affairs in Peking as are the officials. He
apparently cannot fully rely upon the information contained in
the dispatches he receives,. though he persists in placing reliance
upon the imperial 'edict which he presented to the State Depart
ment on Wednesdav.

CHICAGO, July 14.â A special to the Record from St. Petersburg, July 11, via Paris, July
13, says: The Czar has received with great emotion the dreadful details of the catastro
phe at Peking in a cablegram from. Admiral Alexyeff at Port Arthur, confirming the horrible
details of the assassination-ofM.de Giers, the Russian envoy. He was dragged through
the streets by Boxers, insulted, beaten, tortured, thrown into a kettle and boiled to death. The
remains were thrown to the dogs..
iVime. de Giers suffered a fate worse;than death. She was beaten and tortured with
sharp sticks until life was extinct. The legation officials were tortured fiendishly until death
ended their sufferings. M. de Giers and the legation officials resisted desperately and killed
many of the attacking mob.
In the midst of the tortures the envoy is said to have heroically proclaimed his faith in
Christianity. He was encouraged by his wife, who so soon shared his martyrdom.
The announcement of this intelligence to the relatives of the Russian martyrs in China
was accompanied by heartrending scenes. Count Lamsdorf received the friends of the mur
dered ones at the Foreign Office and unfolded the tragic story:
. The scenes of frenzied terror and grief that followed were unspeakable. The building
of the Foreign Office was besieged by an excited throng and the whole of St. Petersburg was
full of lamentation. Immediately upon the receipt of Admiral Alexyeff' s dispatch the Czar
ordered the Cabinet and Council of State to go into session.

LOXDOX, July 14. 5 a. m. â The Tientsin correspondent
of the Express, telegraphing" under date of July 9. asserts
that the Chinese are daily driving in the allies. They have
mounted, says the correspondent, twelve fresh guns in advan
tageous positions, with which they are sweeping the streets of
the foreign settlement, the incessant fire rendering position after
position quite untenable. The Daily Mail's St. Petersburg cor
respondent says that in the last six hours' battle outside of
Tientsin the Cossacks captured six Krupp guns and killed num
bers of fleeing Boxers. The Chinese lost 3000 killed, including
General Kek.
LI HQNG CHANG REMAINS AT CANTON.
The scanty cable dispatches received yesterday add noth

stated positively from Canton that Li Hung Chang will remain
there until the allied troops have defeated Prince Tuan's forces,
and will then go north to lend his powerful aid in arranging
terms of peace, co-operating with Prince Ching, Yung Lu and
the other pro-foreign Viceroys. For the present Li Hung Chang
considers that he can best control and direct the Viceroys from
Canton, and also keep in check the turbulent province of
Kwangtung.
All the foreigners and missionaries have evacuated Wen

appeared at Wenchau and threatened to exterminate the for

reap a golden harvest by having a monop

The Consul General's letter is as followa:
SAX FRANCISCO. July 12, 1900.â To the Hon
orable President and Members of the Chamber
of Commerce, San Franciscoâ Gentlemen: As
a member of your body and aÂ» a representative
of the imperial Government of China I beg to
express to you and through you to the Lmsiners
people of San Francisco generally who may
have friends or interests in China imperiled
by the prevailing conditions there my most
profound sympathy for them and their friends
in the disturbed districts. Happening as this
occurrence has at a time when the United
i States showed itself to be recovering from
past reverses in the trade of China ami when
the future was big with promise for an im
mense business between this coast and China,
it is exceedingly unfortunate that these con
ditions of growing favorableness should be In
any way menaced by anything transpiring in
Our great effort haÂ» been to get the Amer
ican people, and especially the people of the
city of San Francisco, to realiae .what it must
mean to have a considerable share of the
trade of a nation of more than 400,000,000 of
people who are proverbially models of industry
and of high commercial honor, and who are
business men from instinct. I had believed
that my efforts through the business people of
San Francisco had begun to arouÂ»e some at
tention to the great opportunities lying yonder
for them, and It was with exceeding gratifica
tion that I perceived a great trade springing
to afford a field for land sequestration by mili
tary exploiters anxious to Install branches of
their Governments In Asia, but It ls a vast
womb of production whose potentialities must
be reflected upon the world in the form of trade.
It is by sending its goods abroad in exchange
for the goods of the nations that China ls to be
of service to the people of the earth.
Through the grand medium of exchange of
the products of labor for the products of labor
must accrue the real benefits which one nation
can be to another nation and to all nation?,
and the people who are highest endowed in
their ability to nut forth the best and most
! desirable products and who have thereby the
largest capacity for the taking of products to
other nations is the nation chief among the
Integrals of the world. This nation to-day I
regard as the United States. And I say
fronting as It does across the most magnificent
sheet of water upon the globe, the country
perhaps the richest in material resources, of
most continuous and unbroken â¢territorial do
main and of a distinctly radical population,
greatest in multitude of any perhaps of the
world under one government, that in the
presence of such conditions the United States
should reap the very highest advantage from
the Incomputable potential possibilities in
China.
Let not our minds be diverted from the great
scheme of commercial acquisition and exchange
by any acts which Ignorant mobs may commit
in any part of China. That which concerns us
here ia the commerce of what is practlcally
the Orient. No band of robberies, of maraud
ers, of anti-Caucasians or of fanatics should
swerve us In this creat project. We are deal
ing not with the moment, but with the ages.
We are dealing not with units, but with popu
lations.
San Francisco should and by your help will be
the commercial entrepot of this coast, and
as our Government and the influence which
attend It is and will hereafter be alert to sup
press anti-Caucasian bias, so must you here re
sift, discountenance and denounce all antl-
Monogolian prejudice and feeling in order that
amity and comity may prevail which in a con
dition absolutely necessary to precede and abide
with any volume of trade between people what
soever.
It ia my devoted hope that when the atmos
phere of North China ls again cleared It
shall be found that no Injuries have been In

harm has befallen any of your friends or the
interests in which you or they are engaged.

ST. LOUIS. July 13.â Ten detectives en
paged this morning in a thrilling street
light with John Nelson, alleged to be one
of the gang that robbed the Illinois Cen
tral express car of $10,000. near Wickcliffe,
Ky.. early Wednesday morning. In the
battle, which began in the house at SCob
Finney avenue, and extended to the Van
de Venter station, forty shots were ex
changed. Nelson was badly wounded, but
escaped.
General Special Agent George Murray,
chief Â«if the Illinois Central Railway de
tective bureau, was shot by the fugitive,
and is in a hospital, with his left thumb
shattered and a ragged pistol wound
ranging through his leit arm from the el
bow to the shoulder.
Charles W. Barnes, alleged to be a
member of the gang, was quietly over
lowered at C300 West Belle place, at 3
o*dock this morning, and is now in jail.
A decoy note, sent by the detectives,
opened the fight with Nelson. At 3:30
u clock a messenger boy awoke Nelson
and his wife at 3Â«i>S Finney avenue. The
â¢hole told Nelson that Mrs. Barnes, wife
of his allegr-d partner in crime, had been
taken suddenly ill. and requested him to
come over to the Barnes residence.

Nelson fell into the trap. Tho detectives
were lying in wait at the front and rear
of the* house. Nelson appeared at tho
Iront door. He discovered the officers and

Confession of Barnes.
Barnes" confession* this afternoon was
made voluntarily, but later, when he had
seen a lawyer, he declared that the state
ments he had made were made solely to
secure the release of his wife, and that
his replies were dictated and suggested
to him. His confession brtelly Is as fol
lows:
"I am 32 years old and am a grocer's
clerk. I have been working latterly as a
salesman for the Earl Fruit Company of
Redlands. Cal. Mike Â£>oyle, Nelson and
myself conspired to rob the Illinois Cen
tral train. 1 only know Doyle slightly. I
never spoke a dozen words to him. Nel
son sent to California for him, asking him
to come and help rob the train. I met
Doyle at the Union station July 5, alone.
Nelson told me of his plans; Doyle was
not present them, but I met him later.
Xelson never let me out of his sight
after he revealed his plans to me. I
don't know where Nelson got his in
formation as to how much money would
be aboard the train. We had a skiff and
rowed down to a point about two and a
half miles from where the robbery took
place. Each of us had two revolvers. We
had a shotgun, too, but did not use It, and
left it on the river bank.
"Doyle nagged the train. I only stood
guard at the engine, covering the fireman
and engineer. Doyle is the one who
struck the fireman. Doyle and Nelson
went to the express car and made the
messenger open the safe. 1 don't know
who shot at the messenger. There were
about twenty or thirty shots fired, just
to intimidate the crew and passengers. I
fired several shots myself into the air.
When we srot. the money we got on the
engine and ran down about three miles.
Nelson ran the engine and Doyle fired
it. Then we got off and went down to the
rivÂ«r and eot In the boat and divided the
money. I do not know how much we got,
but I guess there was not more than $800.
I got about $100. Doyle left us at Cairo
and we came on to St. Genevieve and
surrendered. I got home Thursday morn
ing and Nelson, got. home Thursday night.
I and my wife met him at Forest Park,
and we came back to town together."

Grosvenor of Ohio, while talking' to-dny
of the political situation, said the plans
of the campaign will be formed at once
and preliminary skirmishing will be car

is a little cooler and the rival leaders have
organized their forces. He says the situa

entirely satisfactory for the Republicans,
but in some places there are indications
of overconfldenee as to results, and at
other points there are disturbing signs of
internal dissensions over local issues.

Special Dispatch to The CaU -
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., July 13.â
Captain Michael Healy of the United
States revenue cutter service, in
command of the handsome cutter
Hugh McCulloch, was brought here
this morning in that vessel from the
north hopelessly Insane and dangerous to
himself and those with whom he comes in
contact. He is in the Marine Hospital
here now in a straitjacket, having be
come so violent this afternoon that this
was the only means of restraining him.
The unfortunate man has in the past two
weeks made three unsuccessful attempts
on his own life, once by cutting deep into
his arm and twice by attempting to leap
overboard from the vessel, on which he
changed places from commander to that
of a prisoner, whose every act was closely
watched by a detail of two men from the
crew stationed in his stateroom to prevent
him doing himself injury.
The first evidence of Captain Healy's de
mentia was shown in Dutch Harbor, when
he gashed his left arm with a sharp knife
and had nearly bled to death before being
discovered by the Japanese cabin boy.
Prompt work by the surgeon saved him
from bleeding to death.
A few days Liter lie was caught on the
rail of the steamer, just ready tf> plunge
into the sea, by one of the junior of
ficers, and it required . the herculean
strength of this youns fellow to prevent
him from accomplishing his purpose. The.
surgeon of the hospital has 'grave doubts
that the sick man will ever recover M3
faculties.
Captain Michael Healy is 63 years of age
and has followed the sea ever since his
sixteenth year.
He entered the service of the United
States Government in March. 1S65, and
continued on active duty therein ever
since, except for an Interim of four years,
from June. 1SD6. to' May. 1900. during which
he was suspended on half pay.
Soon after the purchase of Alaska by
the United States Captain Healy was put
in charge of one of the United States rev-,
enue cutters for duty along that coast
and spent every season until 1S% In the
far north. He was esteemed one of the
best ice navigators in the service and for.
that reason was generally sent to the far
northâ Point Barrow and beyondâ when
other vessels were held south of Bering
Strait.
It was in the performance of this ardu
ous duty, it Is said, that he contracted
the habit of drink that brought about his
suspension. On the return of the Bear
from the Arctic, in November, 1S95. some
of his subordinate officers preferred
charges of drunkenness and conduct un
becoming an officer against him. He was
tried by a court-martial sitting in San

"PRETORIA, July 12.â Yesterday's fight
ing of a somewhat serious character, be- (
lieved to be part of a Boer plan, was an
attempted attack on the outskirts of Pre
toria. Three commandosâ those of De

guns during the previous night took up
positions facing the lesser kopjes five
miles north of Wonderboom Range, but
extending to Zwartkoppies. At daybreak
yesterday Squadron C of the Seventh
Dragoon Guards advanced from the regl
menfs cairÂ«p near Doornpoort on a scout

line to watch. Cholmlys troop was lead

farm, they saw a score of khakl-clad and |

which he afterward dropped. This be

JAPAN WILL AID IN
TRANSSHIPMENT OF TROOPS
WASHINGTON, July 13.-The State De
partment anticipates no difficulty in ef
fecting transshipment of troops and ani
mals intended for the army in China at
the Japanese port of Nagasaki. The point
raised in some quarters that the use of
Nagasaki as a base in this fashion would
be a violation of international law, con
stituting a hostile act against China in
the absence 'of a" declaration of war. Is
declared by the officials here to be ad
solutely frivolous. As a matter of fact,
the War Department has been . freely
availing itself of Nagasaki as a point for
transshipment and a port of rest ever
since the end of the war with Spain, and
the Japanese Government, having made
no objection so for, is scarcely, likely
either to make a. protest Itself or to en
tertain one from any other nation under
present conditions.
Japanese officials here expect that Mar
shal Nodzu will accompany;; the Japanese
expedition about to sail; for China. >The
rank of marshal, probably will .be su
perior, to that of any other foreign com
mander, military or naval, in China. Un
der the Japanese system the rank of mar
shal corresponds with that of field mar
shal in the French system. As a result
of the Chino-Japanese war three marshals
were created by Japan, namely. Yama
gata, who made the remarkable march
into China from the north; Emaya Oya
ma, who entered China farther south" and
seized- Por t " Arthur; and General ) Nodzu,
who had the honor of being the first Jap-
anese officer to score an Important tri
umph on Chinese soil. Yamagata Is now
Prime Minister and Oyama is In charge or
the staff, leaving Marshal Nodzu.'as the
available one of the first distinguished
trio of soldiers. He is beyond middle age,
a sterling disciplinarian and has therep~
utation of being an impetuous fighter.
He is a strong believer in cavalry. 5

JAMES MONROE GOEWEY,
A PIONEER, IS NO MORE
ested itself yesterday, therefore, a sensa
tion was created.
The first result of the activity of th*Â»
Grand Jury, obtained through the work
i of Its expert in examining the records of
J the Probate Court of Judge James M.
| Troutt. is to reveal the fact that Judge
I Troutt has shown in the distribution of
his favors the grossest partiality to his
ex-partner. Martin Stevens, and to A. O.
j Colton. who occupies an office with
, Stevens. Judge Troutt has the power to
I appoint attorneys for absent and miner
I heirs and creditors. He has the power to
Â¦ appoint Â¦whom he pleases and no one his
j a right to question the motive which
prompted his appointments. It ia at least
Interesting to know, however, that the
vast majority of these appointments were
j made by Judge Troutt to hi? ex-partner
, ar.d intimate friend. Martin Stevens.
Groat sums of money are made by these
[ attorneys for absent and minor heirs. The
i court takes an especial interest in these
| lawyers, as they are his choice to repre
j sent people whose interests might other
j wise be left unprotected. The court is
j therefore lenient in his treatment and
i genorous of his favors to them. Ten3 of
Â¦ thousands of dollars have been made by
; Martin Stevens from the simple fact
I that he waÂ« the partner and is the friend
| of Judge James M. Troutt. During the
â¢ last few months Stevens has received
i score? of such appointments from Judge
I Troutt. Day after day he was honored [
by the court's favor in this regard. As I
already indicated, this fact bears no other
significance than an indication of gross
! favoritism.
: One instance of the favor of Judge
j Troutt in making Martin Stevens an at
i torney for absent and minor heirs is of
exceptional Interest. A short time ago
Julius Friedman, a very wealthy man.
died at the Palace Hotel. His friends
were concerned to see that In the admin
istration of his estate there should be no
extravagance and within two hours after
his death therefore they hastened to court
to see that their choice of attorney for
absent and minor heirs should be honored
by appointment by Judge Troutt. They
had no reason to believe that In that short
space of time any one but the close
friends of Friedman knew of his death.
They were astounded therefore upon ar
riving at court to learn that Martin Stev
ens had been appointed by Judge Troutt
to represent the absent and minor heirs.
It is said that the fees of Stevens in this
estate alone already amount to housands
of dollars.
But Judge Troutt has not stopped in his
favors to his ex-partner with his ap
pointments as attorney for absent and
minor heirs. Judge Troutt has gone fur
ther than this. In strores of cases he has
appointed Stevens as appraiser to deter- |
mine whether estates shall be sub- j
ject to the collateral inheritance tax. Out
of this field Stevens has also reaped a
rich harvest. While Judge Troutt has
been so exceptionally kind to Martin Ste
vens, it might be expected that he would
also be generous to the friend of Stevens.
A. O. Colton. The records show that Col
ton has received many appointments sim
ilar to those given to Stevens and has
won from them many rich fees, j These
are the facts that are interesting the
1 Grand Jury. It is perfectly apparent that
Judge Troutt has a right to appoint
whom he likes as attorneys in the cases
which may come before him. He can be
arraigned, however, at least upon, the
question of good taste in appointing so
often men so intimately associated with
him.
There is a movement on foot in the
Bar Association to investigate these and
other facts In connection with the scandal
in Judge Troutt's court. Lawyers, as well
as laymen, recognize that probate prac
tice ia the most serious of all legal prac
tice. The property of the unprotected
dead must by all hazards be guarded and
there is a disposition on the part of Home
of the leading attorneys of . the city to
C â . IKEP.E were fwo startling develop
ments yesterday in the sensational
scar;<!al which, through the ex
Â£> pese of The Call, has fallen upon
the probate court of Judge
Troutt. The Grand J::ry of this city, un
drrÂ« tan ding- the enormity of the offense
v-T.!<"h wes committed In Judg^e Troutfs
court, fcas undertaken an investigation of
the entire affairs of this court. An ex
pert has been employe! to inquire thor
oughly into the ccs^s which have passed
tbroosb the court. ar.d it is expected that
hi* report w:ll soon b* rendered.
This inquiry has already proved what
The Call assorted yesterday morning.
that Judjre Troutt has displayed toward
fc;s ex-partner. Martin Stevens, end a
fr!Â«?r;Â«5 of Martin Stevens. A. O. Colton.
the grossest sort of favoritism in making
them, whenever the opportunity present
ed, the attorneys for absent heirs In the
Â« states of the dead. This favoritism
ibvn Itself during the entire oSicial ca
reer cf Judge James M. Troutt and has
given to Stevens a fortune.
He has had scores of cases ar.d has been
awarded by the court fees that have ag
jrrc-crated thousand? upon thousands of
dollars. Not only has he thus been fa
vored by Judse JarneÂ« M. Troutt. but he
has received by authority of the court
other emoluments. In scores of other
J cases, in -which he was not appointed at
torney for the absent heirs, he has been
made by the court an appraiser to deter
mine if estates are subject to the col
lateral inheritance tax of the State. As
such appraiser he has received five dollars
a day for even' day employed In his in
j vestigrations and in this field alone, small
j as It is, he has earned about one thousand
I dollars in a few months.
There have been day? when he has been
| appointed appraiser for at least three
i estates and his fees therefore have
| amounted to fifteen dollars a day. The
i significance of these proceedings lies in
! the fact that Judg-e Troutt has 'seen fit
i to favor his ex-legal partner with c-nor
! mous patronage from the Probate Court
over which his Honor presides.
The other deeply significant incident of
yesterday's proceedings in the scandal
i which The Call has exposed was the fact
j that the police authorities of this city
are doing absolutely nothing to apprehend
the other scoundrel who conspired with
Chretien to rob the estate of Joseph Sul
livan. The District Attorney's office ap
ptars to be equally listless in doing any
thing that might lead to the detection,
j arrest and prosecution of men who are as
' g-uilty as Chretien in the robbery of tne
| intestate dead.
The police and the District Attorney
j heard the sensational exposures matie in
j Judge Troutt's court. These officers know
j that the man who impersonated and rep
rtseated himself to be John Sullivan is
still at liberty. The Call has given his
name and Is ready to supply his present |
address. It is not the province of this
paper to perform the duty of the police,
who have done absolutely nothing to ap
prehend the man who committed the j
crime against the courts and the people !
of California.
Charles Latner, the loafer who repre
sented himself as an heir to an estate to
which he was not entitled and to whom
Judge Troutt awarded the property by
decree, is still at liberty. He has commit
ted, a gross crime, for which he should
euffer punishment, but the police have
done nothing to charge him with las of
fense or to bring him back to this city,
where he will be tried and punished. Even
a casual Investigation will reveal his
whereabout*, but the police have not even
done this. They have taken no means to
discover the whereabouts of Fred Han
sted. one of the othtr conspirators, who is
now in Nome, and whose conduct in the '
shameful affair is as culpaile as that of
Chretien, Latner and others. It is under
stood, however, that Lee D. Craig is to
fee prosecuted for his negligence in issuing
notarial certificates upon representations
which were not true.
John M. Chretien appeared in the Police
Court yesterday and through his attor
ney insisted that he had committed no
crime. The rascal who presented a bogus
i heir to ttie court declares that he is guilty
j of no offense, and with an audacity which
characterized his other actions demands
that he be released from custody. His de
mand was of course refused, but the pre
liminary' hearing of this case in Police
Judge A. J. Fritz's court was continued
until Monday. In the meantime Chretien
will remain In jail.
A sensation was created yesterday when
It was learned that the Grand Jury had
at last decided to take up the. whole
scandalous affair. It Is to be hoped that it
will be probed to the very bottom and
that no' one guilty of crime shall escape
Â¦ punishment for his acts. The people of
the entire State are interested In this
scandalous matter. Every newspaper In
California Is discussing It as a matter of
the most serious moment, for it touches
upon affairs which are closest to the peo
ple. The fact that the property of the
dead can be stolen by a decree of a court
of Justice has astounded California and on
all hands comes the demand that the mat
ter be Investigated with absolute thor
ouffhaen. Whan the Grand Jury lnter-
till 11:30. and when it was called Whiting
saJd that a continuance had been agreed
upon till Monday morning at 11 o'clock

it will be ready to-day.

Judge Troutt, Who Has Favored Stevens With a Fortune in Fees.
THE startling expose made by The Call of the fact _that an estate of the intestate dead had been awarded by
Judge James M. Troutt to an impostor has led to an investigation by the Grand Jury of the probate affairs of
Judge Troutt. An expert has been appointed^nd is already at work upon the books. One o: the first results
of his inquiry is the sensational discover}' that Judge Troutt has appointed his ex-partner. Martin Stevens, attorney
for absent heira in scores of rich estates. These appointments mean no more than the grossest favoritism. Thou
sands upon thousands of dollars have been made by Stevens and his close friend. A. O. Colton, through these ap
pointments, some of which, made during the last few months, are given in the following table:

censure every lawyer who is Involved in
the Sullivan case, even If that censure be
no more serious than a reprimand for
carelessness. What shall come of this
movement, however, remains to be seen.
More important duties should now en
gage the authorities. They should see
that John XL Chretien does not go un
punished. They should probe the out
rageous affair to the bottom and make
sure that no one guilty of offense is
permitted to escape. They should bring
back to this city and force to trial
Charles Latner, who impersonated an
heir, defrauded the court and brought the
probate laws of California Into contempt.
Nothing should be left undone to bring
Hansted back to this city and to trial.
Whoever else is guilty should be sought
out and punished. Not until this Is done
can the authorities of San Francisco
pect to be considered men who understand
the seriousness of their duty and are will
ing to perform it.
Jud^e Fritz's courtroom was crowded
yesterday morning when John SI. Chre
tien, the disgraced attorney, made his ap
pearance, escorted by Detective T. B.
Gibpon. He looked nale but during the
proceedings he was the most unconcerned
man in the crowded courtroom. He was
represented by Attorneys Barnes and
Curtis, restrict Attorney Byington and
Captain Seymour sat together and
carefully noted every move made by the
attorneys for the defendant.
When the Judge called the case Chre
tien stood up and was Instructed as to
his rights. Then the Judge ordered Clerk
Groom to arraign the defendant on the
charge of forgery. When the clerk start
ed to read the description of the land in
cluded in the deed on which the forgery
charge is based Chretien said noncha
lantly:
"Oh. I know all about that You can
skip it."
When Chretien took his seat, Barnes
said:
"We are ready."
"The prosecution is not ready." said
Prosecuting Attorney Whiting. "We pre
fer to have the matter go over for a day
or^so. Our witnesses are not all present,
as one or two are out of town. Let the
case go over for two days."
"We are exceedingly anxious," said
Barnes, ."to proceed -with the case. We
believe that the hearing before your
Honor on the preliminary examination
will demonstrate that the complaint made
here cannot be sustained . by the testi
mony. Mr. Chretien has been in Jail for
two days, thrown In there from the Su
perior Court. So far as the absence of
witnesses is concerned, there are many
witnesses whose testimony I presume we
would be willing to stipulate should go
in as to what they are going to testify."
"We are willing," said Whiting, "to let
the case go over to any time counsel will
agTee upon so as to suit their conven
ience, but we are not ready to go on this
morning. It Is only fair to the prosecu
tion to allow the case to go over for a
day or so."
"As long as the defendant doesn't con
sent," said the Judge, "you will have to
file an affidavit.*-*- -.
"We will do that," said Whiting, "un
less Mr. Barnes consents to a certain
day."
District Attorney Byington whispered
to Whiting, who promptly said: "AH
right, the prosecution will proceed. We
can start now. and if necessary get a
continuance later on."
"I cannot hear the case In Its entirety
to-day," said . the Judge, "and there are
a number of cases waiting now."
"We do, not desire," Barnes, "to bÂ«
captious, but are anxious to proceed as
far as we can."
It was then decided to continue the caa*

HOMING PIGEON RACES.
The Pacific Coast Pigeon and Homing
Society held its last young bird race of
the 1900 series on the 7th inst. from Red
ding, the 200-mile station. Of all the orig
inal entries of this series only twelve
birds were left to compete. This being the
longest distance ever flown by young bird*
on the Pacific Coast much interest was
taken in the result. '
The winning bird was H. C. Worth's
Minerva 1X-430. which flew at the rate
of 1036.21 yards per minute. This bird also
won second prize from Marysville on May
23. It was hatched in February and shows
great speed and endurance for so younÂ£
a bird. . . - s
William Hartery's Nick IX-551 won see
ond prize, having flown at the rate of
881.59 yards per minute. No other lofts
had returns within the time limit.

The Pacifies depend almost altogether
upon two or three batsmen and if these
fail to get set the whole team collapses.
When he has had a little more practice
George Wiseman should prove a useful
man. as he is a hard and free hitter. On

PRIZES FOR RIFLEMEN.
The local delegates to the National
Schuetzenbund are getting down to active
work, preparing for the big rifle tourna
ment which is to take place at Shell
Mound twelve months from this July. The
date of the tournament had been changeu
so as to avoid a break in the shooting
when it once starts. The former date of
the event included the 4th of July, and
when Shell Mound range waa selected
Captain 1* Sieby declined to break an
agreement with one of the Scottish organ
izations which has picnicked there for
many years. The delegates concluded
that it would be better to make a change,
and the new date for the tournament 13
trom July 14 to July 23, 190L
Since the resignation of R. Finking as
president no one has been selected to fill
the vacancy, and Captain F. Attinger, the
first vice president, occupies the chair at
the meetings. The election of the new
president has been set for the August
meeting. A number of names have been
mentioned, but from all accounts Superior
Judge George H. Bahrs Is favorite. Invi
tations are soon to be sent by the secre
taries to all of the riile shooting clubs in
the United States asking them to take
part in the tournament. Nearly all of the
shooting organizations of this State are
members of the bund, and will send liberaf
representation.
The collection of prizes is well under
way. Considerable hard cash will be re
quired for prizes, and several well-to-do
members of the' bund have offered sums
varying from $50 to J300. Medals, trophies
and merchandise prizes will be offered
without number, and there is no doubt
but what every resident and visiting
marksman will have something to show
for his ability with the rifle.

To-morrow the Corinthians will hold a
regatta on the bay over a course to be
determined by the regatta committee.
Yachts may be entered at any time before
10 o'clock to-morrow morning, when the
course will be announced by the commit
tee. Presidio Shoal buoy will probably
be one of the marks. The race will start
at about 11 a. m. and the yachts will be
in cruising rig. Yachts will be divided
into the usual classes and will be sent
off to a one-gun start. There will be no
time allowances, the yachts crossing the
finishing line In each class being ad
judged the winner and receiving the prize
in that class. The prizes will be present
ed in the afternoon, when the awards
won in the Corinthian regatta held on
Decoration day will also be distributed.
This is the first time that the Corinthians
have held such an event, and it promises
to be very interesting. On the 4th of
next month the Corinthians will start on
their annual up-river cruise.
Early last Saturday morning Vice Com
modore H. R. Simnklns' yawl Tramon
tana left for a trip down the coast to
Santa Catalina Island. Besides her owner
and crew she had on board Harold
Wheeler, Frank Findley, W. G. Morrow
and W. M. Edgell, the last three being
members of the San Francisco Yacht
Club. The yawl has visited Santa Cruz
and Monterey and will spend a month at
Santa Catalina, where E. A. Wlltsee's
schooner now Is.
The Corinthian commodore was accom
panied on last Saturday's cruise to Peta
luma drawbridge by one of the largest
fleets that haa been out during the pres
ent season. On the return trip the sloop
Speedwell lost her topmast. The wind
being light the sail down was slow.
To-day and to-morrow are "open" on
the programmes of the San Francisco
and Encinal yacht clubs, and the Califor
nias start to-day on their annual up
river cruise. The South Bay yachtsmen
and the Oakland canoeists have no events
for to-day or to-morrow.
At a meeting of the regatta committees
of the San Francisco and Corinthian
yacht clubs August 4 waa selected as the
day for the race between the challenging
sloop Aeolus and the defending yacht
Gadder for the perpetual challenge cup.
The race will be on a flood tide. Imme
diately upon Its conclusion the Corinthi
ans will start on their annual up-river
cruise. Next Saturday and Sunday, the
21st and' 22d, the Corinthians will cruise
to Sierra Point, about three miles below
Hunters Point. Cruises In the southern
waters of the bay are usually more hon
ored in the breach than the observance,
few yachtsmen liking the hard knock
downs and ugly sea encountered there.
But Commodore Hawks says that the
cruise will take place this year even if
only one boat makes the trip.

FOR A PLACE
Hot Race Between Stockton,
San Francisco and the
Oakland Nines.
There has been much rejoicing among
the local baseball enthusiasts over the
recent performance of the home club.
Their hopes have been buoyed up by the
clean-cut defeat of the Stocktons in a
series of well played games, and it is
conceded that if the Germans can con
tinue to swat and manipulate the ball
with the skill and esprit de corps that
marked their work last week, the Sacra
znentos will be given a surprise when they
next go up against the metropolitan ag
gregation. The Frlscos are just recover
ing from the shock that the champions
gave them a few weeks ago, and having
fought their way up to within two points
of second place, they are beginning to
get that confidence which is necessary to
win ball games. Much will depend on the
rcwult of this week's series with the Oak
lands, for if the Friscos keep up the good
work the rooters will be fully assured
that Hank Harris has a real flesh and
blood ball team, and the players will feel
that they have a chance to contest Â¦with
Sacramento for first place honors. So
the situation Is ripe for some sensational
ball playing. Will it come? -
How close Hank and his men are to sec
ond place and how far away from first
Is told In the following table. Oakland,
San Francisco and Stockton are now
bunched. The standing of the teams Is:
Games Per
Clubs â Won Lost Played Pet
Sacramento 24 13 37 .643
Stockton 17 20 87 .459
San Francisco 17 21 83 .447
Oakland 16 20 38 .444
Judging from the recent work of Pitcher
Hughes the belief is warranted that h!s
always frail but cunning right arm is not
in first class shape. Pitching a team in
to the championship as he did for Brook
lyn causes somewhat of a strain, and
Hughes has realized that his arm was
affected. Yet it may be that the hitters
of the league have solved his methods,
for it teems unlikely that he would go
Into the box if his arm was not in good
twirling shape.
Manager Harris Is going to utilize three
pitchers in his efforts to accomplish as
many victories this week. Phil Knell, the
strategic south-paw twirler, who signed
a Frisco contract two weeks ago, will
make his first appearance with the team
Sunday afternoon. Knell should lend con
siderable strength to the team. He claims
that his arm is as good as over it was and
that having had a long rest he should be
able to pitch winning ball.
The game to-day between Oakland and
San Francisco at Recreation' Park ought
to be close and exciting. The line-up is
as follows:
San Francisco. Positions. Oakland.
Sullivan Catcher Mangerina
Iburg Pitcher ...Borchers

and crockeryware and broke. $2 50 worth,
agreed to pay the damage in Judge Mo
gan's court yesterday. The Judge there
upon dismissed the case. He also dis
missed the charge against him of having
lottery tickets In his possession.
GOLF MATCHES
TO BE PLAYED
AT SAN RAFAEL
Men's Tournament Will Take
Place This Afternoon, the
Ladies' Next Week.
There will be a match this afternoon on
the links of the San Rafael Golf Club be
tween two teams, one captained by Carter
P. Pomeroy and the other by George
Heazelton. All the men who are able to
be present will take part in %he match,
so that the teams will consist of from six
to nine men each. The game will be over
eighteen holes, match play. The teams
wfll be arranged In the order of the play
ers' ability, number one of C. P. Pom
eroy's team playing against number one
of George Heazelton's team, and so on.
The team with the most holes to Ha
credit when the results of all the matches
are known will win. The ladiea will have
a similar match next Saturday. The San
Rafael course, though somewhat hard,
is in excellent condition, the dryness of
the ground causing the ball to roll, thus
adding considerably to the length of the
drives and brassie shots.
Though many of the members of the
San Francisco Golf Club are at Monterey
or other rescrts. several play regularly on
the Presidio links, among them being
John Lawson and his friend Mr. Adam
son. Hugh Tevis, H. Golcher. J. W. Byrne.
Worthington Ames. H. B. Goodwin,
Charles Page Jr. and Horace D. Pills

The Santa Monica Golf Club has
lengthened its course and Is having a
larger club house built. Though the
course is In bad condition, being hard,
rough and encumbered with stones, the In
dependence Day tournament drew a list of
entries such as was never seen in Central
California, forty-eight scores being hand
ed in in the men's handicap and fourteen
In the ladles' handicap. The men's event
was over thirty-six holes, and the
women's over eighteen. The men's event
was won by S. C. Lines, a left-handed
Philartelphian. with a score of ITS less 20â

FOUR MEETS A
WEEK FOR THE
COURSING MEN
News About the Fleet Hounds
and the Owners Who
Run Them.
It is not yet proved whether the two
<2a>s' coursing in the middle of the week
â¢will be a success or not, although the at
tendance Wednesday and Thursday was
big enough to warrant its continuance.
The shoe pinches In the matter of dogs.
Ordinarily there are entered 120 dogs for
the Saturday and Sunday coursing. This
Â¦week the entries numbered but 80, the
falling off being due evidently to the two
Hakes in the middle of the week.
Last Saturday and Sunday the gate re
ceipts at Union Park amounted to $542 tÂ»U,
e. tidy sum that will help swell the Swee
ney benelit fund.
For some time past coursing men have
been complaining about the excessive
charges which the railroad company has
laid upon them in the shipment of dogs.
An understanding has been reached by
â¢which a person holding a whole ticket
will be allowed to ship one dog free.
Trainmen will be ordered not to charge
txtra for the carrying of one dog.
At a meeting of the California coursing
committee Thursday evening Gus Bonnell
cf Pleasanton was ruled off until further
riotiee. His malfeasance consisted of a
false registration. He registered a litter
as whelped on June 'J when the actual
date was March 12. Dr. Clark of Stockton

to the Pacific Association. The club is in
a highly- nourishing condition, having 10Â»

If the Supervisors should decide to cut
Third street through to the channel the
north half of the handball court and the
south half of the boathouse of the South
Ends would be cut off. The club received
permission from the Harbor Commission
ers to maintain Its buildings on Third
street, but It seems doubtful whether the
Commissioners were empowered to givÂ»
any such permission.

HIS FIRST SHOT AT A BUCK THIS SEASON,
FROM mountain stream end ocean come reports of good
fishing. Seemingly all thÂ© flycastera and deep sea fishers
In the State are hard at their favorite pastime. And the
fish stories are beginning to float in from the country
and go the rounds with wondrous growth. But the foun
dation of big catches is solid, as there have been many tangi
ble evidences of them from one end of the State to the other.
Fly fishing on thÂ© mountain lakes has not been at Its best
during the past week, the trout generally refusing to rise to
the gaudily colored artificial flies. Some flsh have been taken,
but only by the most persistent and the cleverest of the
anglers. There has been quite a colony of the rod wlelders at
Webber Lake recently, including W, C. Murdoch. R. R. Flint.
A. B. Finch. Messrs. Bean and Lowe of San Jose. Mr. Avery
of Oakland, Ell Marks. Dr. Levinson, P. W. Watson, Walter
S. Hobart and R. Edgren. At Independence Lake Frank Hall
and J. J. Winner have been the most successful.
A. B. Finch has been the most indefatigable angler at
Webber. He fished Jackson Creek twice, some ten miles from
the lake, securing sixty good sized trout at the first attempt
and fifty on the second. The pools and riffles of the tiny stream
are fairly teeming with the finest trout. Mr. Finch's second
attempt on the creek is a genuine flsh story. The water was
undisturbed In the pools and the flsh refused to take any kind
of a lure. A dainty fly presented properly had only tha effect
of scattering the flsh in every direction. Standing: on the bank
of the creek It was possible to count from twenty-five to fifty
trout In many pools, some of them weighing fully a pound and
a half. Mr. Finch was on the stream at midday, but purposes
staying there over night shortly to avail of the evening and the
morning fishing.
Mr. Finch took twelve Eastern brook trout from the brook
in the meadow near the lake last Saturday morning. In the
afternoon he fished the Little Truckee and secured thirteen
trout, although they were not taking the fly readily.
J. J. Winner is "high hook" at Independence Lake, having

THIS I? the time when the rifle Is unpacked and the deer
hounds are let loose for the greatest shooting- sport In
California. To-morrow, July 15. the deer season opens
anil the big game hunter will oast his fortune in the
mountains and forests, where the antlered monarch
roams. Already the exodus of shooters has begun. Eager for
their favorite pport and with appetites whetted by long wait
ing, the sportFrnen are leaving the city in large numbers to
take advantage of the first chance permitted them by the laws
cf the State.
As far a? San Francisco shooters go, the season will open
to-morrow for the reason that adjacent counties have game
lawp that pormit sportsmen to shoot deer on and after July 15.
There is a multitude of varying laws in regard to the opening
of the season. Every county in the State has adopted game
legislation of itP own and fixed its own datÂ»>s for the opening
cf the season. The seasonal time for shooting varies from July
1j to October l"as the initial date.
From present reports this season will be a happy one for
the deer hunter. Not in many years have more favorable ac
counts been received from the districts where deer has been
found ia former years. The preserves owned by shooting clubs
end the open public country throughout the State seem
etocked with the big game. This is due in great measure to the
law prohibiting the marketing of venison and to an awakening
on the part of the shooters that ruthless slaughter of deer is
vicious in the extreme.
A number of Country Club men will try their luck Sunday
morning. Those who will use this preserve for their first deer
shooting are F. \V. Tallant. F. S. Hicks of L,os Angeles, Wil
liam Bere. Alexander Hamilton. J. Le Roy Nickel, W. S. Kittle
ai;d Charles Tuttle of Colusa. \V. S. Kittle has been driving
over the grounds during the week and he pronounces the deer
plentiful. As is their custom. Kittle. Hamilton and Berg will
travel tog-ether, and it is a certainty that some line, big bucks
Â¦will be sent to this city Monday, the result of their work with
the rifle. William Berg, the great German traveler, has im
ported a number of hounds specially for this season. lie will
try some of them out to-morrow.
A merry party of sportsmen, headed by William F. Roeder
of this city, wiil go Into camp to-day near Sargents. They will
remain out some weeks and have high hopes of great sport
Â¦with the deer. In addition to Mr. Roeder the party will include
Joseph Nolan and M. J. Desmond of this city, I>r. S. A. Sheets,
Edward Rta and George Loewry of San Jose, Elmer Rea,
George Dunlap and Pony Moore of Gilroy, J. A. Sargent of
Fargente. J. F. JDunn of San Felipe and (Jaston Ashe of Tres
Pinos.
A party made up of almost the same gentlemen camped in
th_e_pame vicinity last year and were quite successful, securing
&. ti"umbr r r of fine deer.
Messrs. Jessop and J. Harhart loft lapt night for Jerry
Llerly's. forty miles* above Tkiah. The deer are plentiful in
this district and the hunting always of a kind to delight the
eportsnian who is out for the chase.
The Tamalpaip Club will have its contingent of shooters out
Tvith the rifle and hounds. W. C. Brown. Fred Dnnkhouse,
I"rÂ«>d Butler, H. Wagner and F. La Coste will work over the
club's preserves in J.Jarin County in quest of deer.
Fred Howard and a party of hunters will work from San
Mateo over the mountains to the coast. Reports coming from
this country pronounce an abundance of big game and the
shooters will senn fiork down there in large numbers on ac
count of the propinquity to the city.
Hut the best prospective hunting and shooting reports come
from Humboldt and Mer.doeino counties. This seems to be the
most popular hunting ground in California, and despite the
difficulty of convenient access draws great numbers of sports
men at the beginning cf the season.
Colonel A. B. tfoemer, General riirkinsnn. Oolonc-l K M
Miles and Major Leo Schmidt, all wearers of the blue cloth and
brass braid, have planned a trip for the first days of the season
in Mendorino County. They will be on the trail of deer for a
fÂ»-w slaves and then return to the city with numerous weird
tales and stacks of venison. They will* do some fishing on the
trip.
Ed Priggs will leave to-day for Mendocino.
The Field and Tv}o dub. an emanation of the Olympic Gun
Club, has secured preserves in Marin County, which will be
used for deer hunting later on in the season. * The land of the
Fir-Id nnd Tulc Club is made up of the Bull Tail. Rodgers and
P.ock Point ranches. During the early part of the sr-ason the
mrmbrrs of the Field and Tule Club will make smaller came

NAPA, July 13.â It was virtually a half
holiday here to-day. Nearly all of the
merchants closed their stores and a large
crowd viewed the sport at the track.
Favorites did not enjoy clear sailing.
Santa Anita Star, the supposed good thing
of the 2:40 class trot, being bowled over by
McBriar, costing the stable and the tal
ent a small wad of coin. In the running
events Gundara, Grand Sachem and
Homestake were the purse winners.
During the afternoon the turf events
were interspersed with foot races for the
small folk, both boys and girls, under the
direction of Si Stebblns. This furnished
much amusement for the occupants of the
sland.
When the nine starters for the trotting
number were called, Santa Anita * Star
brought 10, McBriar 5 and the Held 7. At
the word the favorite, closely followed
by the veteran, "Billy" Donathon, behind
McBriar, soon drew away from the Held
and to the stretch the result looked In
doubt. Here McBriar gradually forged to
the front, winning cleverly in 2:17. After
his decisive win of the heat, McBriar sold
a 10 to 6 choice over the entire field and
justified the confidence reposed in him by
taking the following two heats and the
race. Santa Anita Star earned second and
Bob Ingersoll third money.
The running events proved the greatest
attraction. For the first five furlong
.scramble, Gundara, ridden by McNIchols,
was backed from 2 to 3 to 5 favoritism,
and, getting away first, won all the way.
Coming from last place, the poorly rid
den Candlelight II, which opened favorite,
finished in the place, five lengths before
Fine Shot. March Seven, a heavily backed
one, never looked dangerous.
The six furlong sprint which followed
saw Nettle Clark, a warm 4 to 5 choice,
with Collis In the saddle, beaten by Grand
Sachem in the most exciting drive of the
day, the pair being joined at the close by
Zurich. The first choice made all the
running, but weakened near the end, los
ing by a nose. W. H. Martin squeezed
through next the rail with Zurich, fin
ishing third, beaten but a head.
A mile selling run concluded the racing.
Homestake, backed from 6 to 5 to 4 to 5,
carried the smart money, and, after
catching Kootenal in the run home,
scored cleverly in 1:42^. Collis, astride
Expedient, the opening choice, which ran
into the place, put up such a weak effort
that he was reprimanded by the judges.
"Long Shot" Conley, the one time fav
orite rider, appeared here to-night with a
troupe of colored minstrels. He has ap
parently left the turf.
To-morrow A. B. Spreckels' mare Dlone

round was Cole's, his opponent being
staggered by left swings, which he could
not avoid.
Cox fought Cole to a standstill In the
next round. Cole lost much of his speed
here, his opponent showing the greater,
powers of recuperation. Cole hung on re
peatedly from this point to the end. He
showed remarkable sameness and seemed
on the point of going out several times.
Cox scented victory and seemed to gain
new strength from that fact.
The twentieth round was a sensational
one, each man fighting desperately. Cole
went down once from an overhead swing
but was up quickly. He was trying all
the time, but could hardly see. At the
end both had fought themselves to a
standstill. The referee. Jack Welch, gave
the bout to Cox on points.

der of the bout, but his opponent, al
though taking a tremendous amount of
punishment, never gave up hope. In the
fifteenth round Cole staggered the Austra
lian Just as the bell sounded the end of
the round. Cox seemed completely bewil
dered and could hardly find his corner, the
whole ring apparently whirling about his
head' The bell barely saved Cole in the

When the men were sent together in tne
first round Cole was the aggressor, show-
Ing a neater style than the Australian.
The latter seemed a veteran of the ring,
but his stvle was not that of the modern
school of" boxing. In the second round
he punished Cole considerably, the latter
clucking into a stiff left on the jaw and
getting another in the stomach.
Cox Is Hissed.
Cox was hissed in the third round for
his rough tactics. His favorite blow was
a shortarm swing which he landed fre
quentlv. Cole missed a vicious right
swing.* but Just at the bell staggered the
Australian with right and left to the head.
The fourth round was in favor of Cole,
his opponent hanging on to avoid punish
ment. The fifth was also Cole s round,
as at one time Cox nearly went through
the ropes from the onslaught of Cole. He
recovered near the end of the round and
in a rally hurt Cole, after the men had
fought all over the ring. There was a

*jp? JJL. that was lacking In the flstlc en-
II \\ tertainment at Mechanics' Pavilion
ft last nicht was a couple of knock
outs and a ring that possessed the
semblance of stability. With these three
attributes the 6000 people, who entered the
Pavilion and saw Jack Moffatt get the
decision over Al Xelll at the end of the
twentieth round, and Tom Cox receive a
stellar award from Referee Welch when
the limit had been reached, would have
been most happy and satisfied with the
entire pugilistic proceedings.
In both fights the referee's decisions
were eminently Just, but so closely fought
were they that one man or the other
might have had them were the slight mar
gin of superiority Inclined the other way.
The public will forgive the absence of
knockouts, but It will not soon forget
the flimsy, roped Inclosuro which went
down In the second round of the principal
evert of the evening, delaying the fight
about thirty minute*. The ring Itself
should never have been put up In a barn.
"With no epace to spare the fighters were
constantly slipping off the stage whenever
they were forced to the ropes. The climax
came when Moffatt went down and In at
tempting to protect himself held on to
the rcpes, dragging ring, support and all
with him.
Fighters Greeted With Cheers.
Great was the preliminary fight between
Cole and Cox and this put the crowd in
sood humor. Ilardly had Referee Welch
announced his decision when Al Neill,
backed by Johnny Mitchell, Mike Sul
livan and the "Big" Lawlor, entered the
ring amid a howl of cheers. Moffatt fol
lowed some time afterward, receiving an
equally vociferous reception. Preliminary
discussions were soon over and the two
men stepped toward the center of the
ring.
The second fight between Moffatt and
Neill showed both in better form and o:ie
of them vastly improved In every par
ticular that makes a fighter. From be
ginning to end, two rounds excepted, Mof
fatt, strong and sure of his own power,
confident of his ability to wear out his
oj'jjonent. bored into Neill. sacrificing the
< b&nces of sudden victory by a well
timed knockout punch for consistent and
recurrent jabs and ricrce blows leveled at
his opponent's body. And these blows had
a tf riling effect. In the fourth round Mof
fatt Bbot out his right, which caught Neill
in the very pit of his stomach. The spec
tators could almost feel the jar as Neill
winced. This gave Moffatt his cue and
his greatest execution was with his right
on N'eill'S body till the end of the fight.
The sensational round was the eighth.
Neill did not like the persistent jabbing
he was forced to take from his antagonist
and started to mix things. At close
riiH^e, nphting his man with both hands,
Neill ru!-;if>d Moffat from one side of the
ra:g to the other. He was over-eager
in bis anxiety to end Moffatt then and
i!.t-re. The- latter was in distress and
li. r*- were many present who were a4
ready counting their money and the Cali
fornian was cheered and cheered.
Moffatt Turns on Neill.
But just then the tide of battle took an
unexpected turn. Moffatt pulled himself
logittii-r in most phenomenal fashion and
tivatcd Neill to some of his own medi
cine. Biff, bang, he came at the Call
iv>rnian. who in turn was forced to the
r< <!>â¢Â¦* and for a minute it looked very
much like Moffatt as the winner. Juat
when Neill teemed on the verge of col
lapse he pulled his waning strength to
gtther, and again it was Moffatt's turn
to etep back. For a full two minutes this
wavering rally lasted, and when the gong
s-ounded Moffatt's arms were hanging at
hi= sides and Neill was blowing and limp
with the excess of effort. Neill lost his
passion of blows that were without
chance by an indulgence In a whirlwind
range and without destructive force.
From that round to the twentieth Mof
fatt was at his man with unremittent dog
gedness. There was no getting away from
his vicious right and Neill was constantly
weakening- under the well directed blows.
In the last round Neill, grown desperate
at the prospect of defeat and with the hope
of a rapid finish by a grand coup de grace,
went after his man and he found him.
With right and left he was working MoÂ»
fatt first in one corner and then in an
other. The spectators were up in their
teats shouting themselves hoarse. Again
It looked a bit like Neill, but Moffatt re
peated his recuperation performance and
held off until the gong sounded. The last
blow was a stiff left from Moffatt, which
caught Neill full in the face. Neill was
bleeding from a gash over his right eye,
his face was badly battered and his stom
ach was raw with the beating adminis
tered by Moffatt's strong right. Moffatt
was not pretty to to look at. He, too,
though not disfigured, had received a few-
Jolts that will serve to remind him for the
next few days of the fact that he was in
a tight.
The Ring Collapses.
The second round brought the downfall
of the ring. Moffatt rushed Neill to the
ropes on the south side of the ring and
Neill swinging quickly around changed
positions. It was then that Moffatt
clipped off the stage while drawing back
end the ropes went with him. Just a half
hour was consumed In readjusting the
ring.
Up to the fourth round the honors as far |
bs hitting- went were evenly divided, i
though Moffatt seemed surer of himself
and confident of ultimate victory. At this
Ftage of the game each man was reaching
for the other's head, making the ohin
the objective point. Then came the Hrst
body blow, which Moflatt scored on Neill,
and from this time on till the end that
was Moffatt's strong play. It was very
much like the way George Green wont at
McKt-evcr, whipping in his right over the
heart with slow, sure, steady and appre
ciable effect ,..,,Â«
I- torn that point to the flghth Moffatt
f..upht cautiously, measuring his distance.
an<i Workine both right and left with good
t-JTeot Neill was always there and
ready to iipht back, but he seemed
to fc-ar the other man's right.
Ncili was also cautious, forgetting to pose
and lighting hard whenever at close

From the first tap of the electric timer
until the end of the bout the result was
always In doubt. First one and then the

A SPECIMEN DELEGATION.
\A ASSACHUSETTS is clamoring to the coun
/ \ try to listen 10 her indignant repudiation of a
majority of the men who went from her bor
ders to Kansas City to rcnominate Bryan. She ad
mits that the men are citizens of her commonwealth,
but denies that they are representative citizens. She
will not even concede that they are representative
Democrats, and insists that they be regarded as
freaks, irresponsible themselves, and for which she is
not responsible.
A correspondent writing to the New York Post
for the purpose of making the matter clear to the
readers of the metropolis says: "This Massachusetts
delegation left Boston, as is generally known, at noon
on Saturday. The baggage-car was stocked with beer,
whisky and other alcoholics. With exceptions, which
are numerically trifling, the whole party promptly
proceeded to get drunk. * * * A disposition to
fight soon developed among the party, for which an
opportunity was afforded by the charge that the Ver
mont delegates, who had a car attached to the same
train, were helping themselves too generously to the
Massachusetts refreshments. This charge was de
fiantly hurled back, and in words on both sides that
could not be mistaken for even brutal humor."
The route taken by the festive Bryanites was by the
Grand Trunk through Canada. As soon as ' they
crossed the line some of the delegates began waving
green flags, and when they reached Toronto those who
were able to get out of bed inarched about the station
cheering for the Boers. It was when theytarrived at
Kansas City, however, that the height of the glory
was reached and their brilliance was made most man(
fest. Thus we are told that as soon as they were
shown to the rooms assigned to them at the hotel
"one of the party, who occupied one-ninth of a room
opening out on a balcony over the main entrance,
went out there and without waiting for the formality
of an introduction began to address the crowd as
sembled below. He said he had come to bring the
greeting of Boston to Kansas City. He referred to
McKinley's majority in Boston four years ago, but
told his audience he could guarantee a 10.000 maj'ority
for Bryan this time. They cheered lustily. He went
on to added flights of eloquence in praising free sil
ver and berating imperialism, when suddenly, to the
surprise of his hearers, he shifted his ground by tell
ing them that he was speaking just to introduce a new
citre for corns."
Is it any wonder Boston protests? When an osten
sible representative of her culture goes forth to speak
for Bryan and winds up by advertising a cure for
corns it is time for indignation at the Hub. Had the
gentleman said something about beans or codfish the
word might have been pardoned, or even applauded,
but "corns"â never.
MARYSVII.LE DEMOCRAT.
The time has come to say something upon the place and function of the news
paper In society. Wo by no means magnify the press. We do not ascribe to it the
obsoletion of the pulpit, nor of the schools, nor claim that it assumes the duties
of the individual conscience. But we do feel that the press is on equal standing
with the pulpit, school and individual conscience in guardianship of the purity and
morals of society. Without insisting that all newspapers take this view of their
duty and place, and we are painfully aware that too many become the promoters
of immorality, we must still remind the public that in that respect newspapers are
exactly like men and women, many of whom are conspicuous moral forces teach
ing by example nnd precept, while some are promoters of vice. The latter are dan
gerous in proportion to their social position, just as a newspaper that may be so
cially classed with them Is dangerous by reason of Its command of publicitv â
San Francisco Call.
The Democrat concedes that The Call has taken a stand to be commended and
it has exercised a potent influence In San Francisco during the past two years. It
has exposed crooked politicians and dishonest officials, without regard to party or
the standing,pf men. t
STOCKTON RECORD,
NAPA REGISTER.
, The San Francisco Call Is to be credited with a good piece of detective work
in bringing to book a self-confessed scoundrel, John M. Chretien. It was a start
ling expose of crookedness that The Call made, and was to the effect that the
attorney (Chretien) appointed by Judge Troutt to represent the absent heirs in the
Joseph Sullivan estate had foisted a bogus heir upon the court and swindled
riglit and left in carrying out the trust committed to his hands. Judge Troutt lost
no time in starting the wheels of investigation â appointed Garret McEnerney and
Reuben Lloyd to assist in the sifting, and put the protesting Chretien on the stand.
In probing tor the truth Mr. McEnerney's sharp questioning soon had Chretien on
the defensive. The witness was wobbling wnen court adjourned for the day.
Tuesday. That night his home was kept under the eyes of the police. This was
fortunate, as the bird had planned to escape. "Wednesday, when Chretien again
took the stand, he coolly confessedâ acknowledged that he had paid "Young
Dutchy" Hansted, a notorious rascal, to procure a bogus heir to the estate of
Joseph Sullivan, had coached Dutchy's heir, had imposed him on the court, had
procured an ignorant colored janitor named Colthorp to sign the name "John
Sullivan" to various papers in the case, and sold the false heir's interest to Jake
Rauer, the collector; had received the money therefor from Rauer and divided It
with "Young Dutchy," and had committed flat perjury the day before on the wit
ness stand. "Whatever wrong has been done has been done by me. and I am the
only one to Buffer," said he. Judge Troutt knew nothing of the man's crooked
character when he appointed Chretien, the only applicant for the attorneyship.
Chretien now occupies a cell in jail, and will, of course, "go across the bay."
The court has vindicated itself, leading members of the San Francisco bar have
confirmed public confidence in their honesty, and The Call has performed splen
did service for the people. Proceedings of this sort are calculated to put an end
to the robbing of dead men's estates
Is the looting of the estates of decedents such a disgraceful crime In San
Francisco that It should cause a sensation in that city? In the play of "East
Lynne" an actor, who represented Sir Francis Levison, was accustomed to solil
oquize, while the manacles were on his hands and he was on the way to Jail*
"Is murder a disgraceful and ungentlemanly crime?" San Francisco has had
so many cases of estate looting that public sentiment has been as badly de
bauched on the subject as Levlson's conscience was on the subject of crime in
geÂ«ieral.
Lawyer Chretien Is a victim as well as a villain. Without the fame to get
into a big case like that of Fair and its kind, and probably also without the
ability to "hold up his end" in conducting; such a case, he -went about trapping
smaller game In the estates of obscure Strangers. His "raw" work came to
notice in the office of The Call and that paper put men on his track, in three
days they had him before the court he had deceived and on the fourth he was in
jail after having confessed his guilt in open court.
It may be a mere coincidence, but the occurrence of the name of a notary
in the Chretien fraud, after having been prominent In the Craven-Fair cases
looks peculiar. That name has bobbed up in strange places during a dozen
years and not always serenely, but it appears to bo able to maintain a position
from which to bob after enough has occurred to cause it to court obscurity
The difference in abstract morals between Chretien's methods and those of
some other lawyers is one of degree rather than of guilt. It is also a difference in
skill and shrewdness. The instruments he employed were clumsy and the methods
were crudeâ probably like his knowledge of lawâ and he is in jail as much because
of his lack of skill as for his lack of honesty. The beginning is good, however and
if The Call will only take up that line of work it will be likely to find it as rich in
news treasure as Nome beach is in nuggets.

WOODLAND DEMOCRAT,
We have been watching with much interest the development of the conspiracy
case among certain unscrupulous lawyers in San Francisco, who no doubt would
have consummated the robbery of the unprotected estate of a dead man but for
an expose made in The Call. The charges were of such a startling character that
for a time we suspected that The Call might have overreached itself, but the de
velopments of the last two or three days have demonstrated conclusively that our
contemporary was conservative in its statements and prepared to prove more than
it published. The Call has not only scored a remarkable scoop, but it has per
formed a service for the public the value of which cannot be overestimated

BACKSTAN'DING WAGESâ A. R., Sa
linas, Cal. The law of California does not
limit the amount that a man may sue
for should the debt come under the head
of "backstandlng wages;" but there Is a
law that regulates the amount that may
be collected under an assignment. In such
a case the amount that may be collected
is limited to J10O. To answer the question
more intelligently It ia necessary to know
for what class of work the wages were
earned. The precedence of a chattel
mortgage depends upon conditions.
NEVER DECIDED-T. F. L., City. Tht3
correspondent asks: "If a man rent3 a
house, pays rent in advance, the house
burns down a week after he moved in.
would the landlord have to refund the
balance of the rent or furnish other quar
ters to the tenant?" That is a matter
that has never b?en decided In California.
A decision In the State of Washington
was that the tenant could recover. The
court, however, says that the decision was
not on any cited authority, and that there
is no authority, for the reason that no one
ever questioned the right of a tenant to
recover. A right to recover might depend
on the covenant.
PATRIOTIC EXERCISES- E. R.. East
Oakland, Cal. Section 1702 of the Political
Code of California says: "It shall be tha
duty of all teachers to endeavor to Im
press on the minds of the pupl!.<* the prin
ciples of morality, (the) truth. Justice and
patriotism; to instruct them in the prin
ciples of a free government and train
them up to a true comprehension of the
rights, duties and dignity of American
citizenship." In pursuance of this section
the School Department of San Francisco
has the teachers carry out the Ideas set
forth, and in addition there is an Ameri
can flag In every schoolroom. The pupils
salute the flag every morning and repeat
four lines of allegiance to flag and
country.
MARRIAGEâ M. A.. Stockton. Cal. The
law of California requires, in order that
a marriage may be solemnized, that there
must first be presented to the party who
is to perform the ceremony a license au
thorizing the marriage of the parties. Any
one authorized under the law to solemnize
a marriage would not undertake to mar
ry a couple without such license being
produced, notwithstanding tho fact that
"the parties represented that they had
been previously married by a minister but
had lost the license."
There id a provision of the Civil Code
of this State which says: "Marriage must
be solemnized, authenticated and record
eu as provided for in this article (article
2), but non-compliance with Its nro
visiona by other than parties to the mar
riage does not invalidate that marriage."

sary to issue a circular of information to the effect
that no such statistics will be taken at present, and
that it is doubtful whether they will be collected at
all under the present act.
By way of explanation the circular states that the
census act divides the inquiries to be made into two
groups. The first of these includes those subjects on
which information can be obtained through the
agency of the census enumerators, while the second
includes subjects which can be dealt with without
the aid of enumerators, by correspondence, or by the
use of special agents. The seventh section of the act
restricts the first group to "inquiries relating to the
population, to mortality, to the products of agricul
ture, and of manufacturing and mechanical estab
lishments." The reports on these subjects are to be
"published not later than July i, 1902." The eighth
section provides that "after the completion and re
turn of the enumeration and of the work upon the
schedules relating to the products of agriculture, and
to manufacturing and mechanical establishments pro
vided for in section 7 of this act," that is, after -July
1 1902, "the Director of the Census is hereby au
thorized to collect statistics relating to" several sub
jects specified, of which one reads: 'To religious
bodies."
It will be seen that under the terms of the act noth
ing can be done this year except in a preparatory way
for taking a census of religious organizations.
Moreover, the Government cannot undertake to col
lect such statistics by enumerators, for it docs not
concern itself with the religious opinions of its citi
zens, and has no right to inquire into their religious
faith or ecclesiastical relations.
The church statistics of 1S00 were obtained by a
special inquiry made by means of schedules placed in
the h.-tfids of competent persons in each of the minor
ecclesiastical subdivisions of the various churches.
The director of the present census is authorized to
make a similar inquiry after the regular census work
is over, but he is not required to do so. In his cir
cular he says: "The value of a religious census of
the population of the United States is somewhat
probieryitical. The publication of the volume in
which the statistics of churches are contained has
exerted, so far as can be judged, no appreciable in
fluence upon the religious. thought or life of the na
tion." t.
It appears, however, the Director has not yet de
cided whether or no he will undertake the collection
of such statistics when the proper time comes to do
so, for he concludes b3' saying: "This is a subject
which wilt bear serious consideration and discussion
on the part of those more particularly interested in
this inquiry, and any suggestions relating to it, ad
dressed to the Director of the Census, will be wel
comed."

INJUNCTION GOVERNMENT.
ONE notices the extreme satisfaction of the Ex
aminer in the issuing of an injunction to re
strain the renewal of high rates by the South
ern Pacific Railway in the San Joaquin Valley.
The people \}ill see in this a most radical inconsis
tency. The Bryan platform, supported by the Exam
iner, denounces the use of the injunction as a tyranny,
fraud and usurpation of power. The Examiner's
party proposes to abolish the injunction and deprive
property of the protection of that writ. The courts
deal with property to protect it. The railway takes
the money, the property of the people, for perform
ance of a necessary service in its capacity as a quasi
public corporation. The court by injunction forbids
the corporation taking by that process an undue
amount of property for the service performed. The
court therefore is simply protective of property,
whether against the greed of a corporation or destruc
tion by a mob. Rights are equal. As the writ re
strains a corporation from despoiling others, it also
protects the property of a corporation against at
tack. The Examiner cannot say that its party intends
to leave the injunction standing for use against cot>
porations. but deny its shelter to them when attacked.
\i abolished for one the injunction disappears for all,
and we request the citizens of the San Joaquin Valley
to cast about and find what protection they will have
against a raise in rates if the election of Bryan destroy
and abolish the judicial injunction. We ask. also,
that the people who farm in the valley of the Sacra
mento, Feather. Vuba and Bear rivers to consider
what resort they will have against destructive hy
draulic mining when the injunction is destroyed.
They have lived ar.<l farmed these many years under
government by injunction. Do they desire to quit
and live under government by Bryan with no injunc
tion?

THE PROBATE FRAUDS.
IT is not with any feeling of exultation that The
Call directs attention to the unfolding of proof
after proof of its charge against the robbers of the
estates of the dead.
We would rather have been able to point to the
safety of such estates in the keeping of our courts and
their officers, the members of the bar, and to have
exalted the fame of our city. But we realize that the
only way to secure such a praiseworthy condition and
maintain the fame of this city for care in handling that
property which must pass the courts from the dead to
the quick is by pursuing the rascals who have made a
vocation of stealing estates between the dead hand
and the living.
The offense which we have found to be rife here is
one of the most serious forms of attack upon prop
erty. All the property of a State goes through the
Probate Court once every generation. The owners
and winners thereof live their day and pass, a part of
that ever marching procession which does its work
and goes hence. The property of the people that is
dropped every hour by the dead is in the custody of
the courts. They guard its passage to those to whom
it belongs. They keep its title good and serve thereby
the interests of all future owners. They handle per
sonalty and realty alike. If frauds can steal personalty
they can steal realty, and easily can corrupt the titles
to estate until transactions in realty will become pre
carious, because the courts were subject to criminal
imposition in the probating processes.
It will be easily seen that if such frauds go unex
poscd and unchecked the value of real property de
clines, since certainty of title is the prime element in
value.
Therefore, looking far afield from the interests of
individuals, those of the State are involved in the
most serious way.
These considerations impressed themselves on The
Call, and it saw its duty in line with the good name
of the city and State, the fair treatment of the courts
and the punishment of those who impose upon the
bench that they may steal the property of the dead.
Our readers who have followed the case have no
ticed that it has disclosed a matter of great interest
relating to journalism. The parties whom we accuse
went into court crying out against sensational and
yellow journalism, and striving to identify what The
Call has done with that offensive and malicious policy
of the yellow press, which, in search of cents and sen
sation, attacks indiscriminately everybody intrusted
with public responsibilities, or who happens to step
into the focus of public attention. That sort of jour
nalism, as we have often insisted, is the most potent
partner of crime. It dulls the public sense, and finally
makes it safe for any rascal to class himself with the
decent victims of sensational and yellow journalism,
get public sympathy and escape punishment. We may
confidently appeal to our readers and the public to
be entirely differentiated from that class and kind of
journalism. We have recently said something about
the place and function of a newspaper as a member of
society, a part of the community and one of its legiti
mate forces. We apply the principles then laid down
to the probate frauds. A newspaper is among the
social forces, and so is an attorney at law. Suppose
an attorney, an officer of the court, had been cogni
zant of the forgeries, perjuries and frauds which we
have exposed, and had kept that knowledge from the
court and the public, would he not have failed of his
duty as a member of the bar, and still more grievously
as a member of society?
Having to a great extent the same social and pub
lic responsibility as a lawyer, we detected these frauds
and exposed them, not for a news sensation, nor to
attack any one, but to do our duty.
Here, then, appears the line of difference and part
irg of the ways between yellow journalism and decent
journalism. The yellow variety has in view harming
rather than helping society. Its purposes are purely
selfish. It has no interest in social amelioration, and
would rather promote than prevent crime and abuses,
for it has to invent them if they do not exist, in or
der to gratify the rank and morbid taste which sup
ports it. So finally its sensations make the public in
different, and it becomes the refuge and protector of
scoundrelism.
We think we have made the difference plain. The
Call's established ways made it all in vain that the
parties to these probate frauds cried out that our
charges were yellow and willful and made for the sake
of sensation. The bench and bar knew better, and
the whole city knows better, and all citizens who ap
preciate the need of absolute honesty in probating
estates know better.
When we get through with these culprits the es
tates of the dead will be safer. The admonition will
go out to all who touch them. The senseless delays
and subsidiary actions and waste of estates in litiga
tion that ought not to be will occur less frequently,
and the surviving families of the dead will not be as
likely to have spoliation added to bereavement and
beggary to sorrow, as now.
T "'HIS is Bastille Day. On this day, one hundred
and eleven years ago, the people of Paris de
stroyed that cruel stronghold of monarchical
tyranny, the Bastille Prison; on this day, after
months, nay, years of agonizing throes,, the French
Revolution was born. To that Revolution the states
of Western Europe owe what measure of freedom
they enjoy to-day.
The taking of the Bastille is one of the most dra
matic events in the history of that most dramatic of
nations,\the French. It contains elements enough for
a dozen poignant/tragedies, â love, .hope, rage, despair,
loyalty, treachery, cowardice, courage, brutality,
heroism, ambition, revenge. Perhaps no single day
in the history of the world has witnessed on so large
a scale so terrific a display of human passions in their
utmost intensity.
For the awful bloodshed and slaughter of that day
the people of Saint-Antoine were far less responsible
than were the rulePs of France who had made these
people what they were, â not a little lower than the
angels but a little lower than the brutes that perish.
The remembrance of centuries of "perfidious wrongs,
immedicable woes" could be wiped out only, in blood.
Not those who shed this blood but those who
wrought these wrongs and woes were the real crimi
nals.
As one looks back upon those troublous days, it is
perfectly evident that only by some such deed of vio
lence as the storming of the Bastille could the French
people have kept the little ground they had gained in
their advance against the fortress of Privileged Feu
dalism. On the 23d of June, 1789, Louis 'XVI, in
fluenced by the Queen, the Comte d'Artois and the
Duchesse de Polignac, had attempted a coup d'etat
not less infamous than that which cost Charles I his
life. He prohibited the joint meeting of the States
General, charged them to avoid discussions about the
very questions for which they had been summoned, â
property and cb.ss privileges, â and insisted that they
should deliberate only concerning certain minor re
forms which he professed himself willing to granr.
A portion of the States General, â the Clergy and the
Nobles, â intimidated by the King's threats, withdrew
from the joint session; the Third Estate, heartened
by the fiery eloquence of Mirabeau, defied the King
and declared they could be forced from their posts
only by the bayonet. On the nth of July the Court
Party at Versailles, deaf to the mutterings of the
storm gathering in Paris, followed up their threats
with deeds. Forty thousand troops were stationed
around Paris: Necker, the reform minister, was dis
missed and there were introduced into the ministry
four ardent imperialists, Brcteuil, Broglie, Laporte
and Foulon, who had said that the people might "eat
grass." When the news of this reached Paris, the
popular voice gave answer, in no uncertain tones,
through the lips of Camille Desmoulins. "Friends,"
he cried, "shall we die like hunted hares, like sheep
hounded into their pinfold, bleating for mercy when;
there is no mercy but only a whetted knife? The
hour is come; the supreme hour of Frenchman and
Man; when oppressors are to try conclusions with
oppressed and the word is, Swift Death or Deliver
ance forever!" This was on Sunday, the 12th of July.
On Monday all shops were shut save wineshops atid
bakeries; all trades ceased save the making of pikes.
Arms were sought everywhere but in vain; not until
Tuesday the 14th were there discovered twenty-eight
thousand stand of muskets, hidden in the cellars of the
Hotel des Invalides. Then came that assault on the
Bastille whicii makes this day ever* memorable in the
history of France and of the world.
The happenings of this famous day have been
painted in detail by two of our greatest masters of de
scriptive writing, Dickens and Carlyle: to attempt to
retouch after them would be indeed presumption.
Suffice it here to state in Carlyle's words the lesson
which that day teaches: â
"Great meanwhile is the moment, when tidings of
Freedom reach us; when the long-enthralled soul,
from amid its chains and squalid stagnancy, arises,
were it still only in blindness and bewilderment and
swears by Him that made it that it will be FREE!
Free? Understand that well; it is the deep com
mandment, dimmer or clearer, of our whole being,
to be FREE. Freedom is the one purport, wisely
aimed at or unwisely, of all man's struggles, toilings
and sufferings, in this Earth!"

On Monday next the Commercial News

twenty-fifth anniversary of its existence
as a newspaper. Just a quarter of a cen

The British ship Cralgend arrived from
Newcastle, N. S. W., yesterday after a

Water Front Notes.
The British ship Afon Alaw, which ar
rived from Swansea last Thursday night,
had an unusually rough trip of It during
the first part of the run. Captain Thomas
says:
â¢'I must say that during- an experience
of forty-two years at sea I never exper
ienced anything like such weather in such
narrow quarters."
The vessel was snugged down until she
was under lower fore and main topsail3
and a foresail, but even these were taken
off her or blown out of the bolt ropes and
then she was scudding along under bare
poles at the rate of ten knots an hour.
The Afon Alaw made the run in. 140 days,
which Is a pood average run. It is not in
with the ninety-six day record made from
the same place several years ago by
Captain Thomas in the Merioneth, how
ever. In that memorable run Captain
Thomas started in with a similar pale
and it followed him all the way to San
Francisco.

The steamer Nome City while on her
way from Cape Nome for Portland lost
two of the blades of her propeller in the
ice and was towed into Port Townsend by
the United States revenue cutter McCul

to come to San Francisco and take a lot
of merchandise north for the Alaska Ex

now been withdrawn and the goods will
go north on the Ohio about the middle of
next week.

When the children reached this side
again one of the passengers told Sergeant
Mahoney that they had. considerable
money tor such babies. When questioned
bv the offlcer Ray said his mother had
given him the money and told him to ko
across the bay and bring his aunt over
on a visit. A search showed that the
boys had $3 40 between them so that since
starting out in the morning, they had
spent $1 60. All of them were chewing
gum and each had a bag of candy. Of
this sum the Southern Pacific got 90
cents, there was 15 cents for papers, >so
really all the youngsters spent on them
selves was 55 cents. Sergeant Mahoney
confiscated their wealth and then sent
word out to the parents that they would
find the truants at the Central police
station.
Three lads, the eldest of whom is not
more than 8 years old, were cut short In
a proposed outing by Sergeant Tom Ma

Then he secured his faithful dog with a
clothesline and leading the animal went in
search of Dick and Johnnie Reese, who
live on Ivy avenue. The trio and the dog
went to the ferries and bought three pa
pers, for which they paid 15 cents, and
three round-trip tickets to Oakland, for
which the company assessed them CO
cents. At Broadway station. Oakland,
they tried to sell their papers, but the
boys drove them away, so they decided to
come back to San Frajicisco. In the mean
time they lost their tickets and had to buy
three more in order to get home.

The transport Hancock got In from the
Philippines via Nagasaki last evening. She
made the run from the Japanese port in
the smart time of fourteen days, and Cap
tain Struve says she is ready to sail again
at a moment's notice. The Hancock left
Manila on June 15, but was forced to put
back again by a typhoon. She sailed
again on June 19, but at Xagasaki was
drydocked and overhauled. She brings up
seventy cabin passengers, thirty-one in
the second cabin and 547 soldiers. There
were five deaths from natural causes and
two suicides during the rtin from Manila-
Thirty bodies of soldiers who died in the
Philippines came up on the transport.
The Hancock went into "quarantine last
night.
The transport "Warren is also expected
to arrive during the next ten days, and

NEWS FROM THE
OCEAN AND THE
WATER FRONT
BUSINESS TRANSACTED
BY LABOR COUNCIL
On the side of the laborers the effects
will be far-reaching. Between 12,000 and
10,u00 men will be affected by the strike.
Carpenters, bricklayers, stonemasons,
plasterers, painters, paperhangers, fres
coers. lathers, glaziers, plumbers, stair
builders, mantel and tile setters, metal
roofers, â¢will all be out of employment.
Where so many men are concerned, bne
shrewd contractor points out, there is
grave danger of the strike spreading to
other than the building trades.
Among the large buildings that would
be affected are the new postofflce, the
contract for the millwork of which is not
yet let; the Hale Brothers' building, on
Market street, its mill work also not be
ing let; and the Miller, Sloss and Scott
building, on Mission street. Though the
amount of building Is not unusually large
at present, the excellent character of the
buildings being erected would make the
tying up of the trade particularly unfor
tunate.
Should a stubborn contest result be
tween the unions and employers on the
lines in which the demands are made,
the entire building trade would be in
volved. Comparatively little work can
be done on a house until the mill work
is supplied. ThÂ« unions will not let It be
supplied from outside sources, for that
would only result In driving the work
away from San Francisco to the ultimate
injury of labor, l nable to get mill -work
done at home and forbidden by the unions
from getting it done out of the city, build
ers will be unable to turn a hand. Real
izing this, many contractors are making
no attempt to secure new contracts, pre
ferring to wait for the outcome of the
threatened sirike.
'The Building Trades Council." said W.
M. Page, its secretary, "and the unions
will be very sorry If their demands are
refused and a conflict follows. We con
sidered this question thoroughly and be
lieve our demands are reasonable. The
council is prepared to follow its demand
to the logical end. It camiQt be foretold
what will happen, or what decisions the
council will reach, but 1 believe it will
tie up the whole building trade if neces
sary to win the point."
Unions Are Determined.
"We think the demands of the union un
just because they should first be enforced
(rhere the volume of trade is. We come
into direct competition with the furniture
manufacturers of the Kast and lose a
great deal of cabinet work that should be
done here. We do not think it just that
we should have to fall in line on the
eight-hour question until it is established
at Grand Rapids and elsewhere, centers In
which they already have numerous ad
vantages. If we should be forced to it
nil the more of the trade will go to the
Kast and San Francisco labor will suffer
along with the manufacturers. It is* up
to the unions. They must decide whether
they will wa!k out or not. for the manu
facturers and millmen will stand firm."
The furniture manufacturers .are organ
ized into a sort of branch of the Planing
mill Association, some of them being reg
ular members of It. Joseph 1* Emanuel
of the 'West Coast Furniture Company
said for them:
Think Demands Unjust.
San Francisco that would not be glad of
shorter hours for his employes. On the
score of employing only union men we
can never give in to that. It Is too hard
for us to get good men as It is now and
we must be free to take them wherever
we can find them."
That a i.atrol could not be enjoined unless
it prevented persons from havlns access to
the of the plaintiff.
That one person had the right to ask an
other not to work for a third, and he had the
tame right to ask a person not to patronize a
third.
That the only things that could be enjoined
or restrained were threats to commit bodily In-
Jury upon those working for a third person un
less they quit, or threats to commit bodily in-
Jury uj>on another in caee he went to work for
a third person.
The following names were placed in
nomination for the offices to be filled at
the next meeting of the council: Pres
ident, K. L. Clapp: vice president, W. D.
Goff; recording secretary, Ed Rosenberg;
treasurer, Krnest Koenlg; financial sec

Appointment of Committees on Vari
ous Subjects, With Nominations
of New Officials Made.
Steps are being taken by the unions to
have a mass meeting In Metropolitan
Hall on Angust 4 at which the object of
the Labor Temple will be intelligently laid
before the general public. A committee
consisting of C. D. Parker, Thomas Wright,
Charles Scuppert and H. Gallagher was
appointed at a meeting of the Labor
Council last night to co-opo-ate with a
similar committee from the Building
Trades Council to make all necessary ar
rangements for the meeting.
The secretary was instructed to com
municate with "the Board of Health on the
subject of procuring better sanitary ac
commodation for the men employed in the
various dairies. The Del Monte dairy sig
nified its irfteiuion of unionizing its estab
lishment.
A resolution was passed in which the
Council declared its intention of issuing
a bovcott against the horseshoeing shop
Of McGee, who Is at present shoeing the
horses for the Fire Department, on the
ground that he employs scab help. In
order that the Fire Commissioners may
have proper information on what the
union requires a committee consisting of
A. Dejeau, H. Gibb, A. R. Andre and
Con Manning will wait on the board at
Its meeting this forenoon.
The ruling held by Judge Seawell in his
decision regarding the boycott on G. M.
Kutz & Co. was pleasant news for the
council. The following extracts were read
and received with much Joy:
Unless Building Trades Council or Employers
Recede From Their Position a Bitter
Contest Will Follow.
cr^p STRIKE of the men employed in
'/\ the planing mills of San Fran-
Jf^^ cfj&*. 'he cabinetmakers and the
varnis-hcrs and polishers, on Aug
ust 13 seems inevitable. If it be
not avoided it will almost certainly spread
throughout the building trades, affecting
probably 12/KKi men and absolutely stop
ping ali building.
The planing mill proprietors and the
furniture manufacturers are organized
and are preparing to resist the demands of
the labor unions for the extension of the
eight-hour rule to their factories and
mills and the unionizing of the labor em
ployed. They gay they will be ready for
a long contest, mough they hope that an
agreement may be reached by which the
trouble will be avoided.
The labor union leaders contend that
they ask only what is reasonable in de
manding that mechanics in the mills and
factories be put on an equal footing with
those of the same classes who work di
rectly on the buildings. Believing their
demands to be just, the building Trades
Council representing 1-.00' men. will staiin
firm for the concession* demanded. Bay the
leaders. , Â«
Employers Are Organized.
The notices served on the planing mfll
men the furniture manufacturers and the
employers of polishers and varmshers
were sent out sixty days ago, giving the
employers ninety days to fill contracts fig
ured on the present basis of cost of labor.
Since that time the employers have or
ganized, with a cash forfeit large enough
to lr.sure the adherence of the individual
employer* to the association during the
contest that threatens.

down August 13. It Is claimed that work
on buildings for which the contracts have
been let for the mill work will not be af
fected by a strike, if there is one. as the
unions will not Interfere with the con
struction of buildings the mill work for

cil for the "extension of the eig-ht-hour
The attitude of the mill proprietors is
explained by the keenness of competition
in the trad'e. The proprietors say that
It wili be absolutely impossible for them
to compete with the out of town mills
that work theif men over eight hour?,
Fome of them as long as twelve and four
teen hours. The demand of the union has
been made upon the San Francisco and
Oakland mills alone. Even should the
union extend it to other California mill?.
there would still be the competition of
the Portland mills, which the proprietors
do not t-eJieve can be reached by the
union. Should they attempt it by a boy
cott tbe result would probably be a pro
longed struggle between the unions and
The builders that would not produce
definite or satisfactorv results. The plan-
ItnvmlU nr-n argue that the most profit
able branch of mill work is done at the
Kiw mill? and shipped to this market
ready to be used on the building. These
mills are running ten and eleven hours a
day and pay less v.-aees than the mills in
tfan Francisco pay for nine hours.
Would Drive Out Foreign Trade.
As a furtl;pr justification of their
position the j>!animj-mi!l men say that
the fr.rr'r'.i trade which has been quite
expensive to p?tabli?h and has been the
means of keeping a number of mills run
ning when There is very little for them in
the local market is beinp done at a very
close margin, owinp to the competition ot
mills in the heart of the timber belts and
as far north as British Columbia, and as
a result this trade will be driven out of
San Francisco entirely if thf cost of man
facfurinp: is increased in any shajie.
The planing-mill men complain of other
features of the demands made of them
by the ur.ior.. They are notified to union
lif their mills. At present three-fourths
of the men are in the union. Out of about
550 men employed nearly 400 are union
men. The proprietors object to discharg
ing men that are not In the union. An
other demand is that the foreman of a
mill shall only lay out work and shall
not touch a hand to tools himself.
"Tbe planinR-miH' men hope," Frank
Â¦\Yilkie. secretary of the San Francisco
Planing-mills Association, said yesterdey
afternoon, "that trouble will be averted.
It Is out of the Question, however, for
us to grrant either of the two principal
demands. We would be glad to see the
<-ight-nour day prevail If we did not have
to compete with mills where they work
longer hours. Except for that competi
tion there is not a planing-mill man in

STRIKE IMMINENT
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JULY 14, 1900.
The condor recently sent to the Park
Commisisoners by George Schwlnn of Hu
ron, Fresno County, was declared yester
day to be the property of Golden Gate
Park by that individual. The fact that
the value of the condor had been variously
estimated in the newspapers at from $1500
to $2000 Induced Schwlnn to Inform the
Commissioners that the bird was not In
tended as a gift, but if a reasonable price
were set on it he would agree to sell. The
Commissioners informed Schwinn that
there were no funds available to buy
birds, so Schwinn relented an* donated
the condor to the Dark.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, July 13â A
recent attempt to establish a saloon on
the boundary between Palo Alto and
Stanford University by two members of
the Alumni, has caused much surprise
and Indignation in the community.
While the applicants claim that it is
not their intention to set up a bar, but
to conduct a small restaurant at which
liquor will be sold in connection with
the lunches, the wise ones are of the opin
ion that the resort will in time degenerate
and be in the end a disgrace to the"com
munity.
The Trustees of Palo Alto have taken
the matter in hand and at a recent meet
ing adopted a resolution against the
granting of a license and decided to go
before the Board of County Supervisors
at its next meeting and oppose the appli
cation.
The report became current last night
that the application had been withdrawn,
but later developments reveal the fact
that the projectors are determined to push
their scheme through in spite of the op
position of the community.
The feeling among the University au
thorities is very strong against the project
and much indignation is expressed that
two former students should be Interested
In the affair.

Claim That the Executor Has Failed
to Account for a Large Sum of
Money.
SAN JOSE, July 13.â What promises to
be a spirited contest over the estate of
Adele T. Lefranc, deceased, was inaugu
rated to-day by the filing of a contest and
objections to the final account and dis
tribution of the estate by Marie Lefranc
and Louise Masson, daughters of testator
and heirs to about two-thirds of the es
tate. The executors of the estate are
Henry Lefranc, a brother of the contest
ants, and Paul Masson, but the principal
objection is to the actions of Lefranc, who
is accused of withholding some $60,000
worth of property from his sisters.
Mrs. Lefranc died a few years ago, leav
ing an estate valued at $80,080. This she
divided nearly equally between her three
children. The final account which is ob
jected to was filed April 2 last. It is al
leged by the two daughters that the ac
count does not truly set forth the correct
and full sums collected by the executors,
and that the executors fail to charge
themselves with large sums of money that
have como into their hands. They also
state that Henry Lefranc should charge
himself with an undivided five-eighths of
$4462 received by him, and Paul Masson
with five-eighths of $5332 received by him,
instead of one-half of each of said sums,
as the executors have done.
The contestants further object to the al
lowance of every item in the account. It
is further alleged that the account should
set forth large sums of money and otner
property of great value, worth at least
$60,000, which is a part of the estate of
Adele T. I^efranc. and which was received
and taken possession of during the life
time of Adele T. Lefranc by said Henry
Lefranc, who still has possession of the
same and which he has refused to ac
count for. For this reason they ask that
the account be not allowed, and that
Henry Lefranc be examined by the court
and be compelled to give a true account
of the same.

WASHINGTON, July 13.â The Secretary
of the Treasury has received a letter from
G.. Rudolph, living at S25 Broadway,
Brooklyn. N. Y., on the situation at Cape
Nome, Alaska. The department sees no
reason to doubt the trustworthiness of the
story told by Rudolph and suggests its
publication. It is becoming daily more
apparent to the officials that the condi
tions in the new gold Held are almost cer
tain to result in great suffering during
the coming winter, especially as epidemics
of tmallpox and typhoid fever are threat
ened.
Kudolph takes a very gloomy view of
the outlook at Nome, where he arrived on
June 12, and whence he departed on June
20. Of the men working on the Nome
beach, he says not one was taking out
enough gold to pay for his "grub." The
only place where he saw gold being taken
out, he says, was between the beach and
the tundra, and there men were only mak
ing wages of $7 to $10 a day.
This place, he says, is about three-quar
ters of a mile long and it is all taken up
by about 500 men. Like the beach, it is
now nearly worked out.
Along the several creeks, the writer
says, probably 1500 men were at work.
Of general conditions at Nome Rudolph
says:
When I left 20,000 men were in the district
and the only work was unloading or putting up
new buildings. The former tas<k kept about 5iÂ«J
men busy and the building employed 300. When
1 left June 2U between oiKj and 1*0 wÂ«re arriv
ing daily. 1 went up on the San Bias, which
made a trip on to St. Michael, and brought
down 300 men. The Aberdeen, on which I
came back, made two tripi and brought a few
more than 500. Several other boats made one or
more trips to St. Michael and brought more.
There are far more destitute people at Nome
than those on the outside know of. The water
wells 1 eaw were from twelve to fifteen feet
deep and are sure to be contaminated by all
these people huddled together.
When 1 left there were tents twenty feet
deep and about three mites long. Now, you
don't want to forget that it took more than
fifty vessels to bring all these people to Xome,
to "say nothing of over 5000 coming from the
Yukon. There are not inducements for the
steamship companies to send their vessels back
again for a busted mob. You may think that I
am a cold-foot miner, but ask any miner who
was in that country whether he saw any cold
dust in circulation. That la the way to tell a
good camp. In eight days I saw only one man
pay for a purchase with dust. When asked
about it he said that it was from the Klon
dike.

SAN JOSE, July 13.â An important meet
ing of the Sempervirens Club, which is
making an organized effort to save the
redwood forests of the "Big Basin" of the
western slope of the Santa Cruz Moun
tains, was neld this morning at the St.
James Hotel. Hon. William T. Jeter of
Santa Cruz presided, and there was a
large attendance, many being present
from Santa Cruz, San Mateo County,
Stanford University and elsewhere.
Professor W. R. Dudley of Stanford
University and one of the leaders in the
movement made a report of the work ac
complished. He had recently had a con
ference with Gifford Plnchot, head of tho
United States Forestry Department. It
was an able report and exhaustive. He
exhibited maps of the entire section upon
which the names of owners and the as
sessed valuation of the various tracts
were inscribed, and also described tha
minimum and maximum boundaries of the
proposed park, the smaller including the
Big Basin proper and a small environ
ment, some 35,000 acres; the larger includ
ing Pescadero, San Lavigo, Boulder Creek
and La Honda basins, some 75,000 acres.
The valuation of the various holdings
could not be immediately ascertained, but
would be done as soon as practicable.
Addresses were made by Rev. Father
Kenna of Santa Clara College, Hon.
George C. Rosb of Redwood, Rev. A. L.
Brewer of San Mateo, Duncan McPherson
of the Santa Cruz Sentinel. Professor
Wing of Stanford, Professor Volney Rat
tan of the Normal School.
The meeting decided to push a campaign
of education, and to push the movement
to secure the Big Basin reservation in
every way possible. Also to open sub
scription lists asking for contributions
from wealthy men and thus to a fund
that should be put to the aid of the Gov
ernment in the purchase of the tract; in
other words, not to go empty handed In
asking the purchase from Congress.
The executive committee was continued,
with power to appoint other committees,
and do everything they considered neces
sary in carrying out the work.
Subscription Lists Will Be Opened
and Wealthy Men Requested
to Contribute to a Pur
chase Fund.

SISSOX. July 13. â The train of seven
teen freight cars which broke loose near
Upton last night attained an almost un
paralleled speed. The grade here and for
many miles south Is over a hundred feet
to the mile. The cars that were loose
immediately started down hill and were
not long in attaining great speed, and
shortly after the people of this town
heard the roar of the approaching train.
Before they could hardly realize what
was happening the runaway cars had
passed through at a tiemendous rate of
sÂ«p<?ed all enveloped in a cloud of dust.
The section foreman a short distance
below town put a lar^e four-inch board
on the track to ditch the runaways, but
the speed was so great that the board
was ground to kindling wood. A mile
below here, where the Pioneer box factory
is situated,- twelve of the rear cars broke
from the rest and piled up in the ditch.
Great holes -were torn in the ground, rails
were twisted double and the freight
thrown in every direction. The other cars
rushed on in their wild run. gaining in
speed at every turn of the wheels, until
they fairly flew.
Two mile? from where the first ears
left the track two more of the runaways
jumped off and the others Hew on past
the town of Mott. eight miles from where
thoy started, making the distance in seven
minutes. At a pnint two miles farther on,
known as the eighteenth crossing of the
Sacramento River, the last cars had de
veloped such a great rate of speed that
when the sharp curve was reached they
could stay on the track no longer and all
jumped into the ditch. The rate of speed
at limes must have been over a hundred
miles an hour.
After the train had passed wild rumors
were afloat that a man was seen on the
top of the cars trying to put on the
brakes, but they proved to be groundless,
as none of the train crew Is missing. For
a time fears were entertained for the
safety of the Oregon train, as it had only
passed going down an hour before, and
had it been delayed at u.ny place a fearful
accident would have happened. This is the
third wreck in three days. Seven freight
cars were ditched near Castella Tuesday.
The Pullman on the local jumped the
track at the same ; place Wednesday
morning and rolled to the edge, of the
water in the Sacramento River.

At present nine-tenths of the claims and
city building !ots have been jumped from
one to half a dozen times, and many
pieces of property have been sold by one
party <>r another nearly as often. The
custom at present is for the man who
thinks he own* a piece of ground to oamp
at nisht on it and to try to forcibly prevent
any one else from squatting there. Of
C"un=e, he is not allowed to remain Ions
without having his slaying questioned by
some one. The result is a row and the
lot goes to the man with the best Rrit or the
bijrprcpt backing. Naturally this leads to
serious trouble and up to date has re
sulted in about ball a dozen killings.
As:d" from the?e rows over property,
and two or three suicides, the canii) has
been very well behaved, and is exceed
ingly orderly when the conditions under
which it exists are considered. Sickness
thus far has not been very prevalent;
thouph much pneumonia will probably re
sult from lack of proper shelter during
ihe winter, and unless better sanitation
Is inaugurated tjphoid will also cause
many deaths.
Uwinp to the immense crowds of pas
sengers that are coming up on the differ

Edna Cline, a Little Girl, Falls About
Ten Feet and Is Seriously
Injured.
Edna Cllne, a pretty girl 10 years of asÂ»
living on Hyde street between Jackson
and Pacific streets, met with a serious ac
cident yesterday afternoon. She went to
Russian Hill with her little brother and
nephew and while she stood on the top
of a rocky embankment facing Taylor
street she slipped and rolled to the bot
tom, a distance of about ten feet.
She was picked up in an unconscious
condition and taken to the Receiving Hos
pital in the ambulance. It was found that
she was suffering from concussion of thÂ»
Drain and possible fracture of the skull
and internal injuries. Beyond that there
was only a slight abrasfon on her left
knee.
The girl's father is employed In a Â¦ware
house on California and Front streets.
His wife died recently and left him witn
three young children, Edna being the
oldest.
Preliminary Examination of Ange
lina M. Abbott for Shooting Him
Continued Till Tuesday.
Angelina M. Abbott, the young girl who
Ehot De Witt Clinton, the actor, several
weeks ago, appeared before Judge Mogan
yesterday. Clinton has recovered from
his wound and was in court with his
fiancee, Edna Ellsmere, the actress at
whose home he has been since the shoot
ing. It was thought that he would not
care to prosecute the case, but he seems
determined to do .Â«o for the purpose of
clearing himself from the reflections con

When the case was called, ex-Judge
Graham, who represented the defendant,
asked for a continuance as he was not

Attorney H. Davis, who has been engaged

into court after the continuance was
granted and wanted the day changed to

John A. Carr Fiies Protest With Board
of Works â More Appointments
Made.
Because W. E. Holcomb, representing
John A. Carr, a manufacturer's agent,
was three minutes late yesterday morn
ing the Board of Public Works refused to
accept his bid on surveyors' and engi
neers' instruments. The board was in
session from 10 o'clock until 11 and when
the latter hour Ftruck President Mendel
declared the bids closed. Three minute3
afterward Holcomb rushed in excitedly
and brandished his bid in the air. Colo
nel Mc-ndel informed him that no more
bids would be received. Holcomb de
clared that it was three minutes to 11
by the Fire Commissioners' clock, but
the board ruled against him. He then
declared that he had been misdirected
and for that reason was somewhat late.
John R. Carr, the agent, tiled a protest
later in the day, in which he insists that
his bid was In proper form, accompanied
by a certified check for the required
amount and was presented before the
hour of 11 o'clock a. m., on July 13, while
p;i'd board was in session and before the
time for the presentation of said bids was
advertised to be closed. Carr alleges that
he will be greatly damaged if the board
refuses to consider his bid and that he
will hold it personally responsible in any
damage by reason of the refusal to open
and treat the same as any other bids pre
sented.
The board made the following appoint

noon by Detectives Ryan and O'Dea and
Special Agent Patrick Kindelon of the
Southern Pacific Railroad Company and
booked at the City Prison on three charges
of misdemeanor embezzlement.
For the past eight months the railroad
company has received numerous com

unaffected and simple and human each of

hair, of the loose necktie or open shirt
front in any of them. Their manners were
perfectly simple and in each case very
cordial, though I might say of Whittier.
perhaps, that he was a little shy in un
expected interviews or in talking with
those who were new to him.
I suppose I had seen Emerson in the
pulpit, but of this I have no recollec
tion. I do remember perfectly hearing
him lecture on Mahomet when he was 23
years old and I was 10. And I remember
that the lecture interested me. The sub
stance of It was afterward printed as an
article in- the North American Review.
But it was ten years before I spoke to
him. The interview was characteristic,
so I will describe it In detail.
It was in the college chapel at Cam
bridge, the occasion being what we called
the junior exhibition. In itself this was
not unlike other school exhibitions, but
for undergraduates it had the special In
terest that on this occasion the parts were
taken by the young men who had proved
themselves to be the first scholars of their
class in the first three years of college
life. As it happened, the first scholar was
a dear friend of mine and a near relative
of Waldo Emerson. His "oration" was the
last part of the exhibition, so that as soon
as he closed the company broke up into
groups and there was good occasion for
congratulations. I s-aw Mr. Emerson
standing alone. I joined him and spoke in
high terms of his cousin's bearing and
address. "Yes," said the philoaopher with
a gravity which seemed to me a little
oracular, "I did not know what a fine
young cousin I had. Now, if only some
thing can go amiss, if his father can be
bankrupt, or if he should be unpopular
here and the boys perhaps send him to
Coventry, all will be wellâ all will be
well."
I was young enough to be very indig
nant, though I did not say so. I was
very fond of the "line young cousin," and
I thought this a very brutal way to wel
come his successful entrance into life. I
even thought that it was affected, that
Mr. Emerson was posing as a philosopher
and wanted to say something out of the
way.
But afterward I came to see how un
just I had been and how foolish. He was
never affected. When I found in one of
his essays the words "Good Is a good
teacher, but bad is a better." I saw that
he had learned that great lesson of life
before I heard him express It in the col
lege chapel. And when T came to read
between the lines in his biography, when
I saw that he took the drudgery and petty
economies of life so sweetly as he did, I
could imagine him going back to his own
college career. "President's freshman"
he wasâ that he might save to his mother
the rent of his college room â and after
ward all along he was eager to relieve
her of any cost or charge in the burden
which was upon her in the training of
all those fatherless boys whose lives re
flect such honor upon her management
of them.
After he abandoned the regular duty of
the ministry he threw himself on ths
world, so far as what men call a "living"
goes. He had to maintain In his af
fairs the most rigid economy. But you
will search in vain in his essays or in his
letters for any syllable of complaint. Such
annoyances were no more of a hardship
to him than a summer shower when he
should have been glad to have it clear.
The publisher of "English Traits," the
late Mr. Phillips, told me that when in
1850 or thereabouts he paid Emerson a
check for. the royalties on the first six
months* sales of that book, he did not
know how to indorse or cash a check,
and he told Mr. Phillips that this was the
first money he had ever received from the
sale of any of his books. He owned many
Btereotype plates and many copies of the
"Essays," but money from the sale of

LITERARY TALKS AND REMINISCENCES.
VI.
I first met Whittler when I waa a very
young man in a night ride in a stage
coach. I did not know his name. Twenty
years afterward I made his acquaintance
in a way which I like to describe to
young people.
I had been teaching in rather a forlorn
way In a place rather forlorn. To meet
my home engagements the next day I
had to rise and dress before daylight, to
eat a very poor breakfast and to hurry
to a very early train. All this before sun
rise.
Once in the car I nestled down in a dark
corner and said to myself: "Now, at last,
I can finish my night's sleep." I adjusted
hat, shawl and curtain for the most com
fort and closed my eyes. But not my
ears! For a voice saluted me: "It la Mr.
Hale, I believe."
"Could I not even sleep in my own car?"
This was my mental ejaculation. It was
met. I am glad to say, by the right reply
of my decent conscience: "You fool, who
are you that you cannot speak to a fellow
traveler? 1 ' I simulated cordiality. The
traveler never knew how cross I was as I
offered him my hand and a seat, and lo!
the despised traveler was the poet Whit
tier, lie was charming in the fifty-mile
ride which followed, and was I not glad
that I had not been curt or rude â that I
had, indeed, met him more than half way!
Dear, sweet saint, child of God who
knew his Father by sight, as the pure in
heart do, he never meant to force him-
them he had never received until that
time.
Lowell calls him the YankeÂ« Plato and
Holme? call9 him the Buddha of the
West. Both phrases are admirably cho
sen. But he had a steady touch with
daily life which is more like Socrates than
Plato, and which you look for In vain In
the traditions of Buddha. Fortunately for
us. this touch is revealed very distinctly
in his letters and in Mr. Cabot's admira
ble biography, and perhaps even more
distinctly in the "Reminiscences." by Pr.
Edward Emerson, his distinguished son.
He was as happy at Concord in his sim
ple Xew England home, as he Â¦was in
Karnak or in speaking before a chosen
audience In London. He would go down
early to the village In Concord for hia
mail, that he might stand on the side
walk with the market garden men or
with other neighbors, to discuss politics
or to get the latest points In the village
nows of the day.
When we tried to organize what I think
he called the "Town and Country Club"" in
Boston he -was the working center of the
common-sense party, who wanted a con
venient place where out-of-town people
could meet people who had slept in town,
could leave a wet umbrella or take "a.
hasty plate of soup." Alas! we of that
crowd were "beaten out of our boots" by
the larger crowd of cranks who wanted to
"read papers"' which nobody -wanted to
hear. Such people are the bane and mis
ery of all clubs. In this case they rallied
In' such numbers that they entirely out
voted and defeated the common-sens*
minority. And so thÂ«

Intimate friends.
Their tastes were similar, though in a.
way their methods seemed different, and
they often met. Longfellow was but four
years younger than Kxnerson.
I was in college when Long-fellow ap
peared. Ilia coming had been awaited
with a good deal of interest by us buys.
His brother, Samuel Longfellow, am! I
were intimate personal friends, so that
his arrival meant more to me than It did
to most undergraduates. But to all of us
there was a summer-day feeling when
this handsome young man. fresh from
France and Germany and Italy, with the
very latest tidings of the literature and
fashion and social life of Europe, ap
peared like a flash of sunshine in the well
shaded retreats of what our president.
Quincy, vised to call "the seminary. '
The duty of the Smith professor had
been understood to be a general superin
tendence of the study of the modern lan
guages. The details of that study were
intrusted to different gentlemen, who were
called instructors. Mr. Longfellow was
expected to oversee their work and to lec
ture on such general subjects as he chose
relating 1 to the literature of modern
Europe.
But Longfellow Intimated at once that
he should have a class of his ow*n In
German. He thought he could teach Ger
man by plunging right Into the language
with less detail than was then usual. And
to this class of sophomores taught by him
it was my good fortune to belong. He
made us commit to memory a good many
German ballads. We learned only the
simplest Inflections of nouns and verbs.
So to speak, we pitched Into the language
and then paddled about In It as well as
we could, much as little boys do who are
learning to swim.
It did not require such association to put
us on good terms with Longfellow. From
the beginning he was on easy terma. I
think, with everybody in college. Certain
ly with all those in the three upper classes,
all of whom were required to study some
modern language. You could go to walk
with him. You could call upon him. You
could play whist with him when making
an evening visit. He was older than we
were, but he did not hold himself In the
least aloof from us. And when I look back
over sixty years upon Harvard College I
am apt to think that Longfellow's arrival
and such freedom of his intercourse with
the boys almost marks an epoch in tha
college. I think It had a great deal to do
with the establishment of those cordial re
lations between teachers and pupils which
give a special charm to the Harvard life
of to-day.
His life and letters, as edited by h!a
brother Samuel, give a charming picture
of the successful work of a kind-hearted
man who loved work, who succeeded In
his own line and who worked resolutely
for mankind while he was satisfied with
no standard less than the highest of lit
erary excellence. But I have thought that
from a sort of modesty Innate In the
vounger Longfellow he did not say what
he might have done as to Henry Longfel
low's broad and generous liberality to
ward all the children of sorrow. By a
certain divine law, of which the reader
can guess the origin, every traveling tramp
In America who had the slightest cla!m
to a connection with literature found hU
way to Longfellow's hospitable door. Rus
sian. Pole. Moldavian. Bulgarian. Greek
or Hungarian. Swedish. Norwegian or
Icelandic, German. Dutch. Flemish.
French or Spanish, Portuguese or Italian,
black or white, brown or red. barbarian,
Scythian, bond or free, all came to confide
their penury to him and to be relieved.
Had he not translated Bishop Tegner?
Had he not written of the St. Gothard In
the eleventh century? Had he not written
the "Spanish Student"? Indeed, Indeed he
had.
And with his own self- forget ting cordial
ity he welcomed them all. And they al
ways left richer In pocket, more cheerful
of spirit, less hungry and better clothed.
He lived through all his Cambridge life
in the old Washington house, as we loved
to call it, because there was Washington's
headquarters in the beginning of the rev
olutionary war. The doors of that house
were always open. To the youngest liter
ary aspirant he was as cordial as to the
most distinguished traveler. And no one
ever asked for his criticism or advice but
was glad he had asked, and went away
happy from the Interview.

LITERARY REMINISCENCES BY DR. E. E. HALE.
Spring Valley, Standard Oil, Wells-
Fargo and the Powder Works
Moaning Over Their
Burdens.
?
There were three incidents of interest, If
not three of importance, at the meeting of
the Board of Equalization yesterday af-
ternoon. One was the demand of E. S.
Pillsbury that three big franchise assess
ments be canceled on " the ground that
franchise assessments are illegal anyway
and should not be levied; the second was
the peculiar foundation of the water com
pany's demand that its franchise be low
ered over $2,000,000, and the third was the
inability of Isaac Cohn to find a two-by
four pocketbook, of the advertising kind,
in which he kept track of several hun
dred thousand dollars' worth of business.
Mr. Pillsbury represented the Standard
Oil Company, "Wells. Fargo & Co. and the
California Powder Works. It was on the
assessment of the powder works that he
based his argument.
The franchise of the powder works is
assessed at J2a0,000, and this he wished
stricken out altogether. He raised the
same questions regarding the taxation of
franchises that have been raised ever
since franchises were taxed, and he sub
mitted figures to show that if the powder
company were taxed a quarter of a million
for Its franchise it would endanger its ex
istence in this State.
Some figures nrepnAfd by the Assessor
showed that the markYt vnlup of the stock
of the corporation was $2,250,0(30; that it
pftys taxes as follows: In Santa Oruz
County $4295. in Contra Costa County $3t24,
in San Krancisco County (35S6, in other
counties $520, a total of $11,825; this is on
an assessment of J654.S04, leaving an un
assessed valuation of $l,5!)6,106. The yearly
dividends are J1SO.O0O, or equal to $12 a
share, and the franchise tax would amount
to $14,000. which would reduce this divi
dend to $11 74 a share a year. The matter
of canceling the assessments was taken
under advisement.
In the case of the Spring Valley Water
Company Mr. Kellogg made the contention
that when the Board of Supervisors fixed
the water rates last February they made
a certain allowance for the taxes the com
pany would have to pay, and that allow
ance was made on the basis of an assess
ment of $3,500,000 on the franchie. The
company was willing to nay this, he said,
but in the meantime the Assessor had
raised the assessment to $5,395,223, which
meant an Increase in Ihe taxes of $34,000.
When the board fixed thtÂ« rales at a figure
that would allow the company operating
expenses and a reasonable profit besides
Its taxes, Kellogg snid, they fixed !t on a
valuation of the franchise of $3,500,000. and
by raising the assessment so as to in
crease the taxes by $34,000 they took just
that much away from the stockholders.
The company had figured on a certain tax,
Mr. KelloRg argued, and when the board
raised that tax it reduced the dividends
of stockholders. He asked that the as
sessment on the franchise be lowered to
what it was a year agoâ $3.500 .000. The
board seemed to view the proposition with
favor, but action was postponed until next
Monday at 10 o'clock. In reply to the ar
gument of Mr. Kt-llogg it was asserted,
that the rates of the company had been
figured on so high a valuation that there
is ample margin to care for the increase
In the assessment.
The cases r.f the Standard Oil Company,
the franchise of which is valued at $">000.
and that of Wells-Fargo. which is valued
at $750,000, were both submitted by Mr.
Pillsbury on the showing in the powder
works case, the contention in all three be
ing the same.
Isaac Cohn furnished the only bit of
humor of the afternoon. He declared he
had only $?00 in the bank, real estate
worth $!>7,000, a few outstanding notes and
some other things not worth much. As
sessor Dodge had heard of one note for
$300,000 held by Cohn, but Cohn did not re
member it. He said he discounted a great
many of his notes at the banks, but when
he was asked what notes he discounted he
could not remember. He said he kept no
books, and finally when Mr. Tobin pinned
him down to the fact that he sometimes
made a memorandum he was ordered to
bring it before the board. The board had
experience with Mr. Cohn before, and it
was freely wagered around the table that
he would never- produce the book. And,
sure enough, when at 5 o'clock, the time
he was to be present with his book, he
turned up it was to say that he could not
find his book and therefore could not pro
duce it. Mr. Cohn could not remember
how much he had discounted in notes nor
how many notes he had sold. All he could
say was that he had $900 in the bank and
that was all.
Mr. Cohn is assessed for $100,000 on per
sonal property and $97,000 on realty. If he
does not produce a satisfactory statement
before the board adjourns his assessment
will remain as it is.
Abe Ruef was before the board to have
reduced several assessments on real es
tate. His applications were all taken un
der advisement..
The Contra Costa Water Company was
represented by Mr. McCutcheon. He want
ed a franchise assessment for $250,000
knocked oft. He said that by ordinance
the Council of Oakland had fixed rates to
allow the company 5 per cent on $3,000,000,
and he declared that the company is now
trying to pay 5 per cent Interest on an in
debtedness of j::,o00,W0. In view of that
fact, he said, and also hecause the fran
chise of the company is pretty well as
sessed In Oakland already, he asked that
the assessment be canceled.
W. E. Mighell filed a petition with the
Board of Equalization yesterday in which
it is alleged that he is erroneously as
sessed by the Assessor for the following
named vessels and water craft: Carroll
ton $6250: Charmer. $24 (M0; Florence. $9500;
General Falrchild, $6250; Jabez Howes,
$11,000: James Nesmith. $16,000: J. B.
Brown $6750: Oregon. $9000: Rufus E.
Wood. '$6500; Wachusett, $10,500, and El
well, $6750.
The petition says that the vessels named
are required by law to be registered, and
they were not enrolled or licensed In the
port of San Francisco, but they are regis
tered out of the State of California and
plying out of the waters of this State.
Bartlett Doe wants the assessment of

Senator to succeed George C. lerkins. it
U ttsentlal to tne welfare of California
that men of hiph character should be
cent to the State Senate. Men who take
boodle in one hand and orders from the
railroad company in the other should be
turned down.
San Trancisco will elect five of the hold
over Senators, and the Republicans ought
to win four of the live. The Seventeenth
fc>enatorial District, composing the Twen
ty-eighth and Twenty-ninth Assembly
districts, will elect a Senator to succeed
Samuel Braunhart. A first-class Repub
lican could easily win in the district, al
though it is regarded as the etronsrhold
of the Mint saloon bosses.

Kdwaxii I. Wolfe is a candidate to suc

the Twenty-first District. Wolfe ouzht
not to be returned to the Sonate. His
career in the Legislature was discred
itable. He did not speak the sentiments
of the Itepublican voters who delegated
him to represent the district. He was
a programmer of the rankest kind from
start to finish. His fellow-Senators of
known character and integrity had slight
rtspect for him. Wolfe Â¦was weighed in
the balance and found wanting. General EL
S. Salomon and Frank Grimes are in the
Ji^ld for the Republican nuirunation in
this district.

"COMMONLY USED DRUG"
I>r. Wood Befers to Coffee.
Dr. James Wood of Philadelphia,
speaking of the effect of coffee, says:
"These symptoms bear silent but im-
pressive witness to the terrible injury
which is being wrought by this com-
monly used drug."
If health is worth anything, it is worth
looking after carefully. Any person
who drinks coffee 2nd has any sort of
ailment that can be traced back, through
even a very long line of disturbances, io
the nervous system, may depend upon it
that coffee is the cause of the difficulty.
The drug contained in coffee has a di-
rect action upon the nerves, differing in
different people. The effect may show
in one person in the shape of dyspepsia;
in another person in weak eyes; in an-
other, palpitation of the heart; in an-
other, kidney or bowel trouble; in an-
other, bad complexion or eruptions on
the skin; in another, a general feeling of
lassitude ar.d weakness at times. All
of these and a long list of other disturb-
ances come directly from a disturbed
r^vous. system, where the nerve matter,
the delicate gray substance that is con-
tained in the nerve centers and in the
brain, has been destroyed, to an extent,
and not replaced from the food.
That is the exact work of coffee with
highly organized people. Such people
feel the loss of coffee for a tirne. unless
something is given to take its place.
This is the mission of Postum Food
Coffee: it not only furnishes, when prop-
erly made, a delicate coffee flavor in it-
self, but carries with it the phosphate of
potash ar.d other elements required by
Nature Jo rebuild the nervous system
and reconstruct the tearing down work
that has been goincr on from the use of
"drug coffee." (We use the words
'â¢drupr ccfFee" because all regular cof-
ftr is in reality a drug, and its continued
\Â§f will, in ninety oases out of a hun-
dred, bring on trouble of some kind.)
Postuni Food Coffee is sold by all
first-class grocers. . v *~CHICAGO, July 13. â The opening tone of
wheat. was firm, September starting at an ad
vance of %c to %c at SO^4(g'SO?4c. This was
due entirely to pit trading, local speculators
being Influenced by tha fact that foreign mar
kets did not show an adequate, response to
yesterday's decline here and to the aerious
ness of the Chinese situation. The strength
disappeared almost Immediately. Reports from
the Northwest told of an Improved condition
of wheat as a result of rains and the cooler
weather prevailing and figures on the crop
given out to-day by the Trade Bulletin were
raised considerably. This quickly changed the
balance of trading in favor of the bears. Jhe
Northwest sold continually and the steady de
cline in the prico finally discouraged longs and
resulted In considerable liquidation, which was
kept up with more or less steadiness all day.
Toward the close of the session there was "a
Â¦light Improvement In tone caused principally
by covering by Northwest traders who , had
put out wheat earlier In the week and who
had good profits In sight. The closing, how
ever, was heavy, though at a little better than

Weekly Review of Trade will say:
If the great increase In failures to $100,570,134
In the first half of 1900, against $49,664,661 last
year, and especially to $43,893,079 In the second
quarter, against J21.S95.635 last year, gave occa
sion for diligent search, failure returns will be
worth noting. But to-day it is shown that
thirty banking failures for *25.822,6S2 against
thirty-one last year for $7,601,728 accounted for
much of the difference; that 265 brokerage and
real estate failures for $22,122,346 against 145
last year for only $2,328,215 accounted for
another part, and that In building and lumber
working trades other large failures distinctly
connected with those In real estate explain much
more of the difference between manufacturing
and trade failures last year and this. In these
and much less Important changes In a few
other lines are seen substantially all the com
mercial disasters as yet resulting from the
amazing rise in prices last year, followed by
weary but largely successful efforts during: the
past few months to get a normal state of busi
ness. When this is seen and the remarkable
steadiness in number and size of the great
majority of failures not for exceptional
amounts, there appears ground for especial
satisfaction that business has been on the whole
soundly conducted under conditions of un
usual danger. The Iron Age makes the output
of pig 2S3.413 tons weekly up to July 1, but the
decrease of 16,000 tons has by this time been
exceeded, other furnaces having stopped this
month, and repairs of works and wage scales
may yet occupy some weeks. The increase of
S6.958 tons in stocks unsold Implies a decrease
In manufacture more than double the decrease
in output and the works of five of the great cor
porations are waiting for a decline In wages
Just when the workers have looked for an in
crease. Or>en markets are now admitted at
PIttsburK. where quotations have been for some
time nominal and Bessemer pig Is offered there
at S16. Structural makers decided not to re
duce prices, but steel bars there and plates at
Philadelphia ore said to have, sold at $115 in
some cases. The sheet works open Monday
with large orders. Coke works, about 19 per
cent idle, have no demand now. and In con
tracts It is said that even $2 50 would be shaded
Wool Is growing weaker and even offered by
some Westerners at prices which were refused
not long ago. but the mills don't yet know
what goods they will be able to. sell and from
a temporary idleness there oeems to be no es
cape.
The end of the crop year has brought the
usual estimate, which command no more confi
dence than usual. If the country Rets out of a
crop officially called 547,000.000 bushels all it
wants for food and seed, and 200,000,000 bushels
for export, with considerable left over In sight
it is the easy inference that anxiety is need
less.
Failures for the week have been 196 In the
Lnlted States, against 169 last year, and 28 In
Canada, against 24 last year.

Neiv York Stock Market.
NEVT TORK. July 13.â To-day's stock market
t :.s t'Ut a dull and uninteresting affair and
marked further relapse from the manipulated
rise In the earlier part of the week which
came into pervirr yesterday. Selling to take j
profits was the order of the <*.ay and the L^ant â¢
put out some fresh short lines. That neither j
of the^e operations was on a very extensive j
i-cale is Fhown by the email figures of the j
total Bales of the day and the greater part I
o f even tbtM â¢tnall dealings took place in the j
forenoon when the hull interests were still ',
making futile efforts to continue the advance, j
The efforts ur-re not put forth in thÂ» opening ;
transactions and the sympathetic depression I
from foreign markets was allowed its- full !
*ffert. The weaknef-s there was due to re- !
aewed fears regarding the Chinese situation j
end to the rnichap to the British forces in ;
S"Jth Afrk-a. The effect here was purely sym- j
pathetic and when it was seen how pmall the I
rellinT for London account was the bul!s j
trarrd their eaergi*'? and attempted to resume <
control of the market. The pressure of profit- I
taking uhieh met the market when last night's
level was approach^ discouraged the attempt
and the market lapsed into an almost lifeless
rt&te. The sharp break in the wheat mar
ket which might be fairly construej as in- i
dicatlrs: a. more hopeful feellns regarding the
croj., \vas lowerless to sustain the i-tock mar- !
ket. Small as the offerings were they were |
fuffirient U> drive prices sharply below last ;
nigiit's level. A further advance In sterling I
exchange rates, the hardening of the London i
discount and the continued drain on the gold !
reserves of the Bank of Enpland led to the |
opinion among International h"us<-s that j
further eh!pm*ntÂ« of gold from New York to .
I'Â»rti< are likely to be made next week.
The bond market continued riull and the i
changes were mixed. Total sales, par value,

NEW YORK. July 13.â Bradstreet's to-mor
row will *ay: While trade Is still only of mid
rummer volume, the beginning of Improvement
in demands are apparently becoming visible.
The improvement is ftill one of tone, rather
than of demand, but v.-tth a yield of 540.CO0.000
bushels of wheat, a next to record-breaking
yield of corn and a very large production of
oats, the Western crop situation contains many
encouraging features. The Southern cotton
crop has undoubtedly suffered and conditions
are unprecedented!}- low for this season of the
year, but the acreage planted was a leading one
and prices are so much higher that a satisfac
tory financial return Is confidently looked for.
In addition, railroad earnings point to the
maintenance of the business of the country at a
volume )n excess of last year.
The effort of the big iron and steel concerns
to control prices. If really made, has proven
abortive and another wholesale slashing of
quotations Is to be reported this week. Produc
tion, however, is falling off and Increases of
6tocks. though conFlderable. would seem small
if renewed activity occurred.
It is liard to see how lower prices can be ex
pected and it la said that present quotations are
attracting some business, particularly at Chl
caco.
The industrial situation Is rather better as a
result of agreements upon Wages by a number
of iron and steel manufacturing concerns and
their employes. Lower prices for lumber are
apparently Inducing more activity in build
ing, thoush how much Is due to this or how
much to the settlement it labor disturbances
is hard to measure.
Wheat, including flour, shipments for the
week aggregate 2.823.910 bushele, against 3.018.
Â£32 bushels last week, 3.2G3.813 bushels in the
corresponding week in 1899, 2,910,827 bushels in
1S9S. 1,622,092 bushels In 1897 and 2,953,949
bushels In 1896. From July 1 to date the wheat
exports were 5,845.742 bushels, against 7,022,787
bushels last season and 5,669,469 bushels in
1S&S-99.
Business failures in the United States for
the week number 221. as compared with 14fi last
week, 174 in this week a year ago. 22S In 189S
241 in 1897 and 255 in 1S96.
Business failures in the Dominion of Canada
for the week number 22. as compared with 25

NEW YORK, July 13. â Bradstreefs Finan
cial Review to-morrow will say:
Much attention is jA<1 at this period by thÂ«
speculative world to corn crop conditions and
prospects. The news bearing on the subject at
present has been favorable, though drought and
hot winds in the western portion of the corn
belt have furnished material lor stories of a
total loss to the crop In that section. This was
the occasion for some selling of the granger
stocks during: the week. The Chinese troubles
also continued to look very grave, though at
the beginning of the week the disposition In
l^ondon and the other foreign financial centers
was to look on tha absence of news from
Peking as a good rather than a bad sign. Lon
don's sales of American stocks were partly
counterbalanced by renewed purchases, and It
was noted that all of the foreign offerings have
been very well taken. In fact, the market,
though narrow and at times a very dull one,
has Fhown a considerable degree of under
lying strength, and this activity was in con
nection with the advances of several prominent
trading stocks, like Union Pacific, Baltimore
and Ohio common, Illinois Central, Norfolk and
Western and Sugar. In the case of the two
first-mentioned securities the movements were
ba*e-d on renewed reports of favorable action
in connection with dividends, the expectation
being that both stocks will be placed on a 4
per cent basis. The declaration of a 2 per
cent semi-annual dividend on Louisville and
Nashville had a favorable effect, although it
v.-as about what had been confidently looked
for. The disposition of the street, In fact. Is to
take a more cheerful view of railroad dividend
prospects.
The l>nnn: market, too. Is bare of offerings,
and in come cases prices for favorite, moder
ately high ifsues have fully recovered the
amount of their July coupons in the past fort
night.

COMMERCIAL AND FINANCIAL NEWS
manrt sterling to-day revived discussion In Wall
street of possible gold exports.
The bid price for demand bills, $1 86%.
brought the rate above international parity
and within rante of -engagements If conditions
abroad should become sufficiently urgent to
Justify the allowance of "interest in transit."
One foreign exchange house said that to-day'fl
market looked like shipments next week if the
present tendency toward higher rates should
be maintained. A rumor â¢was current that one
banking house was actually figuring on a ship
ment by next week's steamer. A prominent
house said it waa too early to predict where
the sold would go "in case a, shipment should
be negotiated; higher money prevailed in Eng
land axid discount was easier in Berlin. Paris,
It Is believed, will get some gold by next Thurs
day's steamer if negotiations go through. No
Bold has been shipped from here to Europe
since June 21, the total exports of that week
from New York having been $4,251,000, most of
which, I3.500.C00. went to Germany.
Berlin was at that time in financial straits,
its money market ruling at 5Vs per cent and its
exchange on London having fallen consider â¢
ably. The market has eased since then, aa to
day's reduction of % per cent in the Imperial
Bank of Germany's official rate shows. But
Paris exchange to London, which in June stood
at 25f 12',4c to the pound sterling, about the
usual point when gold goes to France from
London, has subsequently fallen 2c further.
and it is estimated that on a "triangular opera
tion" this very low Paris rate would offset the
low point of New York exchange as the spe
cial inducement offered by Berlin did last
month. The last gold shipment to (Jermany
was arransed with sterling at |4 86%, or HÂ«
above to-day's rate.

on Thursday, but the reports from the orchards
were bo significant that after a session pro
tracted until 1 o'clock yesterday morning they
decided not to name any quotations until Aug
ust 1. It seems that the Prunes have stopped
growing and are turning yellow, in addition to
the serious drop already mentioned. Those that
will mature will probably be small. The enor

of the past, thoueh it must not be Inferred that
anything like a failure Is anticipated.

Representative Grosvenor of Ohio Believes
I That Minister Conger and All the For
eigners in Peking Have Been Put to
LyOCLU I Uy I I Mo I II I lt>.
CALL HEADQUAETERS, WELLINGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, July 13. â Representative Grosve
nor of Ohio arrived here to-day from home on his way to New York, whence he will sail for a brief
trip to Europe. The political outlook is not causing him as much concern as the terrible condition ex
isting in China. His long personal association -with Minister Conger and the dread that the latter has
met an untimely end at barbarous hands is forced upon him by the conflicting and unsatisfactory reports
coming from the Far East.
"I apprehend," said Grosvenor, "that Minister, Conger and all foreigners in Peking have been put
to death by this time. I cannot, convince myself that American ingenuity combined with that of the rep
resentatives of the foreign powers would fail to^ invent some means of communication with the outside
world during this long period of silence if any of them were alive. I cannot help believing that our rep
resentatives and their allies, if alive, would have found means of getting word to us at home. In my
judgment, this Chinese question is more terrible to contemplate than any other question we have to deal
with. Of course, it can cut no figure in the coming political campaign, except that it will continue to
overshadow^ in public interest any subject that may be 'suggested by either of the political parties. Even
now the tidings from China are being discussed throughout the land to the exclusion of all other topics,
and the newspapers are relegating national politics to back pages to give the right of way to Chinese
news." , â¢ Â¦
BERKELEY, July 13.â Considerable tn
fluence Is being brought to bear upon tho
Berkeley graduate manager, Reno Hutch
lnson, relative to the appointment of a
trainer for the football season. The two
aspirants, Al Lean and Georgo Huffcr
dine, have many friends among the under
graduates and alumni of the University
of California, and each is being pushed
forward as much as possible.
Al Lean had been the athletes' guld* In
training didpllne for two successful sea
sons, but his contract was not renewÂ«Â»d
earlv this year. He was succeeded by
Hufferdine. who put the track team In
condition and went East with It. Both
are good men. though Lean fcas had con
siderable more experience. Hufterdiaa
was more attentive to his duties.
Manager Hutchlnson will not make hla
choice until college opens, when he will
have the advice of &11 the athletes.

CHANGE FROM STATE
TO NATIONAL BANK
now being considered and will shortly be
# put into effect by the Central Bank. It
'involves the change of the institution into
a national bank with a savings adjunct
under State laws and a safe deposit at
tachment. The only point remaining un
decided Is the exact date when the change
j will be made.
The Central Bank does a very large
i commercial business now, the bulk of its
! operations being In that form. The change
| from a State bank to a national bank
would not be very great and would give
the bank the beneiit\of the greenbacK
circulation, of which 5t cannot take ad
vantage as long as It remains under the
State banking laws.
The plan involves the changing of the
name of the bank to tne Oakland National
j Bank, with the saving? department to be
i known as the Central Savings and Safe
{ Deposit Company. The present quarters
i of the Central Bank will then be occu
pied by the National Bank and the safe
deposit vaults and savings department
will bo moved into the large store in the
Central liank building across the hallway
from the present quarters.
These changes will involve some consid
erable expense, particularly the moving
of the safe deposit vaults. A system of
tuch vaults would involve the expendi
ture of $50,000. including the cost of the
vaults and the setting of them in place
with proper burglar and lire proof appli
ances.
"In common with a great many other
lianklng institutions we have been figur
ing to sec whether It would be benellcial
for us to change from a State to a na
tional bank," said Cashier Charles Yates,
"and we have always had plans for a safe
deposit system. But when the changes
will be made or whether they will be
made st all has not been determined "
But despite the uncertainty of the state
ment of the bank officials the only point
that remains to he decided Is the exact
date for the changes and that Is not like
ly to be far distant.
The point which lias caused the delay
is the objection upon the part of the stock
holders of the Central Bank to transfer
ring a large amount of deposits to a new
bank. This has been ol-vlated by granting
the stockholders of the Central Bank per
mission to subscribe to the stock of the
new-national bank at par.
An Important Move Contemplated by
the Directors of the Central
Bank of Oakland.
OAKLAND, July 13.â One of the most
Important banking changes in Oakland is
OAKLAND, July 13.â Manager Cal
Ewing Is the victim of another deserter
from the ranks of his baseball aggrega
tion. Pitcher 1i. C. Eeville, after giving
repeated assurances that he would stay
with Oakland, has gone back on his word
and signed to play with the team of
Butte, Mont. Beville is the fifth of
Ewing's players to leave him on short
notice. He Is promised $175 a month sal
aryt
Ewing has suspended his erstwhllo
pitcher from the California League for a
term of five years. Beville is a compara
tively new player and this was his first
season with a league club. He made a
good record as a pitcher and batter. His
place in the box will be filled by Mos

EWING THE VICTIM
OF ANOTHER DESERTER
ROW OVER PROFITS
OF IRON FOUNDRY
Martin O'Connell Accuses His Part-
ner of Misappropriating Funds
of Phoenix Works.
OAKLAND. July 12.â The Phoenix Iron
and Structural Works of this city is In
volved In a partnership row which threat
ens to be bitterly fought In the courts.
Martin O'Connell has accused hla part
ner of misappropriating the funds of the
firm and refusing to render an account
ing when requested. He claims that ho
has been mulcted In a considerable sum
of money and in a complaint filed In the
Superior Court to-day petitions for the
dissolution of the copartnership and the
appointment of a receiver to take control
of the Iron works until a final decision
is rendered.
The Phoenix Iron and Structural
Works Is a thriving concern, the alleged
wronged partner declares, and the profits
from the business are large. Since tho
copartnership was formed on May 1, 1S9Â»,
a large amount of money has passed
through the hands of the firm the ac
counts of which have been kept by Hen
neberry.
According to O'Connell his time during
the past year has besn spent away from
the works. It being necessary for him to
superintend outside work and make bids
tor contracts. During his absence. hÂ«
says, hia partner. Henneberry, collected
money which he kept and for which ha
made no accounting. The complainant
also accuses his partner of threatening
to make further collections and wlthholil
the money.
WHY SHE WANTED
A SHORT SENTENCE
*JpP LAMEDA, July 13.â "Look here,
//_j\ Judge, I don't want you to keep
j[~~\â¢e in the jug any longer than you
can help. My birthday comes on
the 23d of August, and I've got to get out
and enjoy myself."
And Justice of the Peace Morris, who
contemplated giving ancient Jennie Hart
six months in the County Jail for va
prancy. relented. He did not want to be a
party to the spoliation of a lady's day of
pleasure. Forty days, the Judge guessed,
would serve the ends of Justice, and the
prisoner was taken across the estuary to
take the rest cure in Sheriff Rogers'
summer resort.
Although Jennie Hart will be 73 years
old on the day of her liberation, she is
still full of youthful fire. Last night sh.e
destroyed all the furniture in the
woman's department of the City Prison,
and let loose such a volume of oaths that
the police found it necessary to lock her
up in the steel tank. She made kindling
wood of two chairs, a bed and a table, and
twisted the gaspipe out of shape. Supper
dishes viere smashed into bits and
thrown at the officers when they tried
to subdue the woman. The compartment
looked us if it had been struck by a cy
clone. The woman did not cease to swear
roundly when finally reduced and forced
Into solitary confinement. She was
caught yesterday while trying to "lift" a
box of fruit from a grocery on Park
street.
BURKE'S LAND
GOES ASTRAY
OAKLAND, July 13.â John
Burke of Commerce street,
Melrose, is trying to solve
The question as to where he
resides. Up to yesterday he was
sure b,e owned and lived on lot 30
of the Melrose tract, but when he
called at the Tax Collector's office
to pay his taxes he was told that as
the lot was mortgaged the mort
gagee would pay the taxes.
Burke could not remember having
borrowed money on his land and
told the Tax Collector so. That of
ficial, however, was sure of his
stand and showed the Melrose man
the records. There, sure enough,

Young Man's Bravery Hewaitied.
ALAMEDA. July 13,-Bradford Perry,
the young man who made a gallant res

which the Twenty-seventh Senatorial District
Convention Is called^ will appeal with special
force to the Republicans of the Fiftieth As
sembly District. The Fifty-nrst District will
have twenty-nine votes In the Senatorial con
vention and the Fiftieth but nineteen. These
two Assembly delegations will constitute thÂ«
Senatorial convention, making forty-eight
votes. It Is seen at a glance that the iwenty
nine votes from the Klfty-first will not only
name Its Assemblyman, but will, without any
reference to or regard to the Fiftieth District,
also name the Senator. This arbitrary blanket-
Ing of the Twenty-seventh Senatorial District
has so clearly been done in the Interests of
Mr. Metcalfs candidate for the Senate that it
cannot fail to react.
OAKLAND, July. 13.â The Republican
county campaign was launched in
Alameda County yesterday by the
action of the Republican County
Central Committee, which fixed the plan
for the conventions and the primaries.
The launching was not accomplished,
however, without considerable creaking '->*
timbers and groaning in the spirit of con
tending factions.
The fact was that the friends of Con
gressman Viator H. Metcalf controlled the
County Committee and they fixed the plan
adopted, by which every district fight was
left by itself and trading and combina
tions were made Impossible. It has been
recognized in Alameda County for many
years that trading in conventions was one
of the great evils in politics. A man
might secure his delegates and go Into a
convention applying for some honor and
by a trade lose everything. In the past
combinations have been made between
wards and townships to control conven
tions by trades to the exclusion of other
wards and townships and much bitter
feeling has been engendered tMereby. Can
didates for district nominations have been
at the mercy of trades made between dele
gations not in their district. Assembly
men and Supervisors and Senators have
been nominated by deals between seta of
delegates from other parts of the county.
Under the plan adopted yesterday this
has all been done away with. Every dis
trict will hold its own convention, which
is separate and distinct from every other
convention, with a separate meeting
place and a separate set of delegates, un
der this arrangement every candidate
stands upon his own popularity in his
own district and the results of the pri
maries will be practically a nomination.
Supervisors cannot trade off Assembly
men and Judges cannot trade off the
Supervisors and it resolves Itself to mere
ly a question of whether a man can secure
the delegates from hlf. own district, and
if he can he can be nominated without
danger of being thrown out by combina
tions.
There was a strong tendency to make
combinations throughout Alameda Coun
ty,.the combinations to extend from Con
gress down to local officers. Those who
desired district nominations were seeking
the protection of candidates for Congress
or making combinations with legislative
or supervisorial candidates. Things
threatened to become complicated, for
district lines cut across each other In
most peculiar ways. and. the County Com
mittee made up Its mind to force every
local candidate to stand squarely upon
his own merits and do away, once and
for all. with trading in conventions. It
was a contest between the friends of Vic
tor H. Metcalf and Henry P. Dalton. in,
which the Metcalf forces won.
The Oakland Enquirer, which is the or
gan of Henry P. Dalton and Is supporting
him for a Republican nomination, makes
this attack upon the action of the Re
publican County Committee in the Issue
of this evening:
Never has such a spectacle of political Job
bery been exhibited In Alameda County as that
presented yesterday afternoon at the meeting
of the Republican County Central Committee.
On former occasions there have been incidents
and programmes that have been repudiated by
decent voters at the polls, but the bold and raw
work of yesterday afternoon stands unparalleled
In the history of politics In this county. Prom
ises were broken, decency was cast aside, men
fermltted themselves to be moved abcut like
pawns on a chess-board, and the only redeem
ing? feature of the repulsive spectacle was th*;
fidelity to decency and to manhood shown by
the minority of the committee.
No sooner was the rollcall ended than It was
made evident that the County Committee had
already been controlled to do partisan politics
of the most offensive character.
The resignation of Committeeman Hutton of
Berkeley created a vacancy, and at once the
gang proceeded to fill It by the election of
George D. Metcalf by a vote or 6 to 5.
Under the leadership of Messrs. Nusbaumer
and Frick. the managers of Victor U. Metcalf.
the programme commenced by putting in Mr.
Metcalfs law partner, the appointment of
whose ton as a cadet to Annapolis was one of
Congressman Metcalfs first official acts, as &
member of the committee, and ended by making
the Superior Judges the sponsor* for the party,
and putting the judiciary hopelessly Into the
very vortex of politics.
The most serious aspect, however, of the
whole nefarious business Is the placing of the
superior bench directly In politics. For the
first time the delegates chosen to nominate the
two Judges will also name the new County
Committee. This makes the two Judges ab
solutely responsible for the party machinery,
which cannot but fail to be a position es
pecially repugnant to Judce 0?<1en. who has
always been very positively opposed to dotns
politics. Nor can the situation be ony more
satisfactory to the many friends of Judxe
Ogden. who have become his friends largely
because of the fact that he has persistently
refused to allow the ermine to be tainted with
the practice of politics.
As the matter Is left by the County Com
mittee the Judseshlps and the County Com
mltteemen are inseparable, and they must
stand or fall together. In other words, a man
Â¦who would secure a nomination for the bench
must "do politics" or lose.

Hard Training.
RESTING FOR THE CONTESTS.
PARIS, July 13.â The American athletes
who are to take part In the contests or
ganized by the exposition authorities
spent the day In relaxing their muscles
from the strain of their recent work and
are giving themselves a thorough rest.
Pennsylvania's men did not come hero
from Versailles, but spent the day in
lounging and taking short walks at Neu
illy. The Princeton men adopted the same
tactics, while the members of the other
teams, which are located In the city
hotels, kept indoors, avoiding the heat,
which is Intense.
At the grounds of the racing club somÂ«
of the foreign entries were at work in tlio
early morning, but the scene was
bright and lovely when the grounds were
filled with well-built specimens of man
hood, representing the highest develop
ment of all branches of athletics engaged
In putting the finishing touches on their
training. Workmen were busy arranging
the track and hurdles and softening the
jumping spots, the hardness of which
caused some complaint. Many of the
officials were making final arrangements
trying to meet the demand for tickets, the
pressure for which Is enormous. The
grandstand Is unpleasantly contracted,
and where the crowds which are expectod
will be accommodated is a hiird propo
sition. Unless a storm should make the
grounds wet and break the summer heat
the weather should be Ideal.
The first of the preliminary trials will
begin at 9 a. m. to-morrow. The day's
meeting will be completed by 1 p. m. in
order not to conflict with the grand mil
itary review which occurs In the after
noon.

FISHERMEN'S STRIKE GROWING
VANCOUVER, B. C, July 13.â The fish

the fishermen are being held up In the

111S Broadway, July 13.
Thomas B. Freeman, a local carriage
maker whose domestic difficulties have
kept him before the public for some time,
is entitled to the distinction of being cited
for contempt of court more times than
any man whose name ever graced the
civil records of Alameda County. He has
been before the bar of justice a dozen
times to show cause why he has not paid
his wife $20 a month alimony as ordered
four years ago, but has on .each occasion
demonstrated his Inability to pay and
thus has escaped punishment. Though
she ha3 about reached the conclusion that
her recreant ex-husband Is a citation im
mune, Mrs. Freeman still perseveres and
her latest attempt to secure alimony will
be considered by Judge Ellsworth next
Monday.
When Sarah Freeman was granted a di
vorce from Thomas B. Freeman, the
plaintiff was awarded $20 a month ali
mony, $20 costs and $50 attorney's fees. A
demand was made on Freeman, but ho re
fused to pay, pleading poverty. He was
cited for contempt, but was dismissed.
Every three or four months since he has
been regularly commanded to appear In
court, but the citation proceedings have
not had the effect of making him produce
a cent.
About a year apo, tlrincr of the Inef
fectual citations, Mrs. Freeman lay In
wait for her former spouse with a horse
whip and pave him a sound thrashing.
Even this had no effect and she again
resorted to the citation process. The
seeker after alimony has three times
changed her attorneys, for a time trying
a legal representative of her own sex.
Mrs. Clara Foltz, but she Is yet to re
ceive the first alimony payment.
stock yesterday, when It fell from 72 to
67, was due to the fact that the board of
directors met yesterday and decided to
pass the regular dividend.
Whether this was done because of the
expense attached to the litigation and the
uncertainty of income from the new con
dition of things, or whether it was done
deliberately In order to prove to the court
that the new water rate ordinance would
seriously injure the value of the com
pany's stock. Is something that cannot be
proven without the evidence of the com
pany's officials.
Experts for the City Informed
That the Accounts Desired
Were Burned Long Ago.
1 /^=5\ AKI.AND, July 13.-The attorneys, i
[{ jl officials and experts of the city of !
vLJ/ Oakland have at last officially sat- >
â isfkd themselves that the story of I
the destruction of the books of the Con- I
tra Costa Water Company, as published
In The Call some weeks ago, was abso- ;
lutc-ly correct. They made their applica- j
lion for the books of the water company j
to-day and were politely informed that
the books had been destroyed, but that ;
they were welcome to examine euch
books as the company now has. ; ;
The application was made by W. A. M. I
Van Bokkelen and J. C. Crandall, the two
experts? chosen by Robert Y. Hayne. and
appointed by Judge Hart as the official
expert* of the city. They were taken to
the office of the Contra Costa "Water Com
pany by Assistant District Attorney Con
don and introduced to President J. H. T.
Watkmson. Then Mr. Watklnson made
the official announcement that the books
had been burned.
The experts asked to look at the books
that were opened after the destruction
of the r,ld books, and were shown the
books as asked for. The two experts
â¢went over the various accounts in the
ledgers and copied, for the use of the city,
the balances that were carried over into
the new books from the old ones some
thing over a year ago.
These balances showed nothing that
would be of the slightest use to the at
torneys for the city, and the experts
found that there was little that they
could do. So. armed with the figures that
they had secured, they went to San Iran
cIpco to consult with Mr. Hayne and de
cide what they should do with Judge >
Hart's order that th^y be permitted to j
examine books that did not exist.
Destroyed Long Ago.
/ President J. H- T. Watkinson of the
f Contra Costa Water Company made a
statement to-day for the first time as to
the destruction of the account books.
"The books were destroyed long ago,
before this agitation was begun," said Mr.
Watkinson. "in May. If.*, they were all
taken to the p'P^ > aru of the company.
at the foot of Webster street, and there
burned.
â¢'There was no intention of trying to
prevent any one from peeing them, but

the way. When we moved from the old
office on Eighth street we had the ac
cumulations of many y^ars and we
tried to find vault room for them. When
we moved from the office in the Blake
& Moffltt building we found that our
vault room would be very much re-
Ftricted. and we decided that we would
ptr!ke new balances and burn the old
books.
"Experts were put at work on the
books and when everything had been
put in shape Â« struck final balances and i
opened a new set of books.
"Then we found ourselves wljh a lot
of old material that only cumbfred the
office There wore the accumulations of
twenty-five years, and we decided .that j
they would be best destroyed. I took |
five carloads of old books and papers, j
moldv and dusty, down to the foot of
â¢\\>hster street, and we built a fire in the 1
middle of the yard, where it would not
'nJure anv buildings and where we could |
cremate everything. I stationed three i
men about the fire so that the leaves
and scraps would not blow over the en
tire neighborhood and we burned the
whole lot.
Kept Valuable Documents.
"Of course, we kept all of the documents
that were of value, such as surveys, ab-
Ftracts of property, titles, maps and such
papers of that kind as would be of use In
the future, but the old accounts all went

"The demand made this morning was
only for certain books prior to the date
of the destruction, and as we did not have

5T took five policemen one hour to dis
entangle the troubles of Walter Gann,
a young farmer, who hails from tho
giant tree region in Mariposa County.
He is enjoying his first city experience.
The rural resident's suspicion for every
thing that bears a metropolitan taint, and
a few drops of blood, caused unlimited
excitement In the neighborhood of Pine
and Kearny streets Thursday night and
nearly thrust upon the "upper office" an
other mystery.
One week ago Gann came to town. As a
boy in the rural districts he had listened
to wondrous tales of city sharpers with
big diamonds and had formed an opinion
that the big town's Morgue was always
well stocked with victims of the crook's
craft. His first departure from home was
a matter of great moment, and kindly
neighbors breathed Into his ears a warn
ing to avoid the snares and temptations
that would soon surround him. They cau
tioned him about blowing out the gas,
purchasing gold bricks and green goods,
playing dice games, becoming familiar
with "old acquaintances" from the coun
try, and told him to place the back of a
chair against his door at night. Hence
waiter arrived In town impressed with a
grave terror and strove to follow his
friends' advice.
Thursday night he went to sleep In the
Carlton House, 403 Kearny street. His
room was as secure as a life-timer's cell,
and in one of his hands he held the
handles of an old carpet bag, used fifty
years before by his father. He went to
sleep thinking of burglars: he dreamed of
burglars, and when he awoke shortly after
10 o'clock cold shivers were playing tag
on his vertebrae. His forehead smarted
and a few beads of blood stood out from
thÂ« flesh.
"Great Scott!" he shouted, "they have
tried to kill me for my gold." Terrified,
he burst the door open and dashed down
stairs, out through the door and along
Kearny street in an almost nude condi
tion. A great crowd gathered as he
screamed for the police. Patrolmen
Frank Engel and William Hines respond
ed and listened to the man's story. They
found that the man's so!iÂ» possessions,
consisting of $8 75. remained In the grip,
and that the room had been securely
locked when he awoke.
As the mystery of the wound deepened
Officers Allen Frary, Frank McGrayan
and "Con" Carroll were detailed by Ser
geant Duncan of the California-street
police station to assist in solving the
problem. Two questions could not be an
fcwered: "What produced the wound on
Gann's head?" and "How did the mur
derous villain escape?"
The police searched for clews with the
sagacity of a Sherlock Holmes. With
magnifying glasses they scanned every
Inch of the carpeted floor for footprints.
Hines looked under the bed and pulled tho
mattress to pieces. McGrayan, who has
servrd several terms on the squad in
Chinatown, looked for secret panels.
Even fly specks were carefully cut out
on sections of wall paper and preserved
to be used as evidence.
"They must have opened a hatchway In
the roof and dropped something on him."
said Carroll. "It was a cowardly act."
Thereupon Engel spent half an hour on
the roof.
'Â¦Thfrf'll be something drop on usÂ» all
!f we don't unravel this mysterious case."
decided Frary as he climbed down, cov
ered with dust, after having inspected the
transom.
Few more words were spoken. Each
man was too busy with his own thoughts,
which were of broad sergeant's stripes
and short coats. Meanwhile Gann stood
in his scant attire and shivered.
After an hour's investigation the truth
dawned upon the bluecoats. Gann had
scratched himself, while asleep, with his
ring and his fears, born In country life,
did the rest. The patrol wagon drove the
policemen back to the station and each
called the other a fool.
BERKELEY. July 11â The marriage
of Miss OUvÂ« Vail of Los Angeles
and Axgyle Tully of this dtr took
place in Sacramento Thursday
night, the ceremony being performed on
the. eta^e of the Clunie Opera House after

landkerchlef" and "Boccaccio." During
her present engagement she is singing

CHARLESTON. B. C. July 13.â The Na
tional Educational Association closed its
convention here to-night. During the day
two sessions of the general convention
were held, during which Beveral papers
were read. ' * .
President-elect Green was introduced
and spoke briefly at the night session,
after which the committee on resolutions
made its report as follows:
In accordance with established customs and
in order better to enforce those beliefs and
practices which tend most powerfully to ad
vance the cause of popular education and a
civilization based on Intelligent democracy, the
National Educational Association, assembled
In its thirty-ninth annual meeting, makes this
The common school Is the highest hope of the
In developing character, In training intelli
gence in diffusing information, its influence is
incalculable. In last resort the common
school rests not upon statutory support, but
upon the convictions and affections of the
American people. It seeks not to cast the
youth of the country In a common mold, but
rather to afford free play for individuality and
for local needs and alms, while keeping stead
ily in view the common purpose ot all educa
tion. In this respect It conforms to our politi
cal ideas and to our political organization
which bind tocÂ»ther self-governlne States in a.
nation, wherein each locality must bear the re
sponsibility for those things which most con
cern its welfare and Us comfort. A safe
motto for the school as for the State is: In
essentials, unity: In non-essentials, liberty; in
all thing.< charity.
A democracy provides for the education of all
its children. To regard the common schools as
schools fnr the unfortunate find the less well
to-i'.o. and to treat them as such. Is to strike a
fatal blow at their efficiency as democratic in
stitutions; It is to build up class distinctions
which have no proper place on American soil.
Thp purpose of the American common school
is to attract and to Instruct the rich, as well
as to provide for and to educate the poor.
Within its walls American citizens are made
and no person safely can be excluded from Its
benefits. :'Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦
What has served the people of the Uraited
States Â«o well should be prominently placed at
the service of those who, by the fortunes ot
war, have become our wards. The extension
of the American common school system to
Cuba. Porto Rico and the Philippine Islands is
an imperative necessity In order that knowl
edge may be generally diffused therein and the
foundations of social order and effective local
pelf-government laid on popular intelligence
and morality.
Reorganization Urged.
The provisions of law for the civil govern
ment of I'nrto Rico indicate that it Is the in
tention of the Congress of the United States
to increase the responsibilities "of the Bureau of
Education. We earnestly urge upon the Con
gress the wisdom and advisability of reor
ganizing the Bureau of Education upon broader
lines, erectlns it Into an important department
on a plan with the Department of Labor; pro
viding a proper compensation for the Commis
sioner of Education, and of so constituting the
Department of Education that while its inval
uable function of collating and diffusing infor
mation be in nowise impaired, it may be equip
ped to exercise oversight over the educational
system of Alaska and of the several islands
now dependent upon us. as well as to make
some provision for the education of the chil
dren of the tens of thousands of white people
domiciled In the Indian Territory, but who
are without any educational opportunities what,
ever. Such reorganization of thn Bureau of
Education and such extension of its functions
Â¦we believe to be demanded by the highest in
terests of the people of the United States, and
we respectfully but earnestly ask Congress to
make provision for such reorganization and
extension at their next session. The action so
strongly recommended will in no respect contra
vene the principle that it is one of the recog
nized functions of the national Government to
encourage and to aid but not to control the
educational instrumentalities of the country.
We note with pride the rapid extension of
provision for a. separate secondary and higher
education as well as for technical, Industrial
and commercial training. National prosperity
and our economic welfare In the years to come
will depend in no small measure upon the train
ed eklll of our people, as well as upon their
Inventiveness, their persistence and their gen
eral Information.
Kvery safeguard thrown about the profession
of teaching: and every provision for its proper
compensation has our cordial approval. Proper
standardsâ both general and professional â for
entrance upon the work of instruction, aecurity
of tenure, decent salaries and a systematic
pension system are indispensable if the schools
are to attract and to hold the service of the
beft men and women of the United State?,
and the nation can afford to place Its children
in the care of none but the best.
Standards of Efficiency.
We welcome the tendency on the part of col
leges and scientific schools to co-operate In
formulating and administering the require
ments for admission to their several courses
of instruction, and we rejoice that this asso
ciation has constantly thrown its influence in
favor of this policy, and has Indicated how, in
our Judgment, it may be beat entered upon.
We see in this movement a most Important
step toward llfihtenlnB the burdens which now
rent upon so many secondary schools and are
confident that only good results will follow its
success.
The efficiency of a school system is tr> be
Judged by the character and the Intellectual
power of Its pupils and not by their ability to
meet a series of technical test*. The place
of the formal examination In education Is
distinctly subordinate of teaching and its use
as the sole trs>t of teaching is unjustifiable.
We renew our pledge to carry on the work
of education entrusted to us la a spirit which
shall be not only non-sectarian and non-politi
cal, but which shall accord with the highest
Ideals of our national life a,nd character. With
the continued and effective support of public
opinion and the press for the work of tha
Fchools. higher and lower alike, we 6hall enter
upon the new century with the hiKh hope born
of successful experience â¢ and of perfect con
fidence In American policies and Institutions.

ST. LOUIS, July 13.â A special to the
Tost-DIspatch from New London, Mo.,
says: Ex-Governor Charles P. Johnston
of St. Louts, one of the chief attorneys foV
the State in the trial of Alexander Jes
ter, charged with the killing of Gilbert
Gates, brother of John W. Gates, madÂ« a
statement to-day as to the reasons which
led to the prosecution by Gates of. the
aged prisoner. Said he:
Gates family had long since given
up all intention of ever pushing the case
ot the murder of their boy to trial, but
one year or more ago this man was
forced again to the attention of the
Gates family under the most peculiar cir
cumstances by Jester's sister. John W.
Gates told us he felt it a duty he
owped to the memory of his dead brother,
a duty he owed the State, and, above all,
a duty he owed his aged parents, to de
mand a vigorous trial and an unearthingf
of all the testimony possible. We have
had detectives follow the trail through
four States and know every act of Alex
ander Jester for the past thirty years."
Francis Marlon Dawson, who lived
about four miles east of the Hulin lane
and south of the Harris, Mo., road, in
1871. took the stand to-day. He testified
that in January, 1871, he met Alexander
Jester In this lane. The old msji had two
teams and wagons. They were standing
still in the road at a point east of the
Â¦\Vest Madison road. As Mr. Dawson
passed. Jester asked him how far it
was to a road that he could turn south
on. This evidence is considered to be
sufficient to show that Jester's turning
from the main thoroughfare was not an
accident, but to conceal this alleged
crime.
John D. Mott of Valley Center, Kansas,
testified that he had lived there twenty
years and had known Jester thirty
years. He said Jester lived with his wife
and seven children, and that he never
knew him as Hill. He had seen at his
place in 1S70 a two-horse "jolt" wagon and
a buffalo calf. The witness said Jester
farmed and also exhorted a little. He
attended Sabbath school.
J. C. Temple of Rennick, Mo., testified
that he saw Jester and Gates at this town
In 1871. Jester exhibited the buffalo calf
there and took up a collection. This is
supposed to have been a short time before
Gates was killed.
Joseph B. Delaney. an old citizen of
Monroe County, testified to the truth of
the story that his wife had made him
get up at their home near Mlddlegrove
one night In January, 1871, stating that
she heard cries of distress. Mr. Delaney
said that the next morning he went to
the camp and asked the old man what
the noise meant. He said Jester told him
he had choked young Gates while he.
Jester, was dreaming. The witness to
day pointed to Jester as the same man
that told him this story that morning In
January, 1S71.

VALLEJO, July 13.â F. W. Plummer of
Vallejo received Judgment in the Supe

secured Judgment in Judge Browne's
court, from which the case was appealed.
Plummor, while on his wedding tour,
flagged a train at the Orphan's Home

bis wife were put to much inconvenience

F. W. Emmons Viciously Attacked
With a Broken Bottle by "John
Doe" McDonald.
F. TV. Emmons, who is engaged in the
transport service and lives with his wife
at 103 Van Ness avenue, swore to a com
plaint in Judge Mogan's court yesterday
for the arrest of "John Doe" McDonald on
a charge of assault to murder.
On the night of July 2 Emmons heard
some one at the door of his room, and dis
covered McDonald, who lived in the house
looking through the lteyhole. They had
some 1 , words, and McDonalu, who had a
bottle in his hand. struckiEmmons on the
head'wlth it, breaking the bottle. He con
tinued striking Emmons on the head and
neck with the Jagged edges of the broken
bottle, inflicting fifteen wounds. Emmons
has since been confined to bed, and yes
terday was the first day he was able to
leave the house. >
The Case Will Probably Be Trans
ferred to the United States
Circuit Court.
Attorney Bert Schlesinger appeared be
fore Superior Judge Murasky yesterday
and succeeded in having the $25,000 judg
ment secured by Thomas J. . O'Brien
against Superintendent of the Mint Leach
set aside, on the ground that the defend
ant had innocently neglected to make an
swer to the suit brought by O'Brien for
false imprisonment. The court had pre
viously ordered judgment by default en
tered because of the failure of defendant
to make answer. The court's order was
conditional upon the payment of $20 costs
by the defendant.
The legal tlrm of Denson & Schlesinger
has been retained by the Government to
represent Superintendent Leach in this
case. They are now preparing an appli
cation for the removal of the cause to the
United States Circuit Court, on the ground
that the act of Mr. Leach in causing the
arrest of O'Brien because he insisted in
making political speeches from the steps
of the Mint, contrary to the orders of the
superintendent, v.as by virtue of his posi
tion as a Federal officer, and that the only
proper court to try a Federal officer. on a
charge of that kind is a Federal court.
The defense will be that the steps of the
Mint are for business purposes, for the
Ingress and egress of people who have
business in the place, and are not to be
used for political purposes.

BRIGADIER GENERAL, THOMAS
II. BARRY.
BRIGADIER GENERAL. THOMAS
H. BARRY arrived in this city yes
terday and is stopping at the Occi
' dental. He is on his way to Manila,
having been appointed chief of staff to
General MacArthur. General Barry has
seen considerable service and is well
known in this city, having served in the
First Infantry at the Presidio as captain,
and later as major in the adjutant gen
eral's department.
This will not be General Barry's first
service in the Philippines. He was adju
tant general on the staff of General Oti3
and sailed with *that commander for
Manila in June, 1S98. His return to the
land of the Filipino is rather sudden, as it
is only about two months since he came
home from the islands.
General Barry will sail on the transport
Sumner next Monday. The ship will also
carry four companies of the Fifteenth
United States Infantry, under command of
Colonel Moale. The troops are destined
for Chica, via Nagasaki.

Out With a Boathook.
An unknown man was seen to fall into
the waters of the bay from Mission-street
pier 2 yesterday evening by E. Boelsems.
pipe inspector for the Spring Valley Water
Company. The inspector immediately put
out for the drowning man in a boat and
finally succeeded in catching him with a
boat hook before he sank for the last
time. Life was not extinct when he was
brought to the surface, but the man ex
pired an hour later at the Harbor Hospi
tal.
When the body was taken to the Morgue
there was nothing on it that would reveal
the identity of the unfortunate. The man
was apparently 70 years of age. had gray
mustache, hair and eyes, weighed 175
pounds, was five feet ten inches in height
and had false teeth. He was poorly
dressed in a dark overcoat and dark serge
pants and vest. A silver watch and 80
cents in coin were found in his pockets.
Whether the man committed suicide or
accidentally fell into the water Boelsems
is unable to say.

Gay Costumes, Music and Tea-Drink
ing Have Caught the Popular
Fancy.
The second day of the Russian tea fes
tival, held in the parlors of the Graeco-
Russian Church, under the auspices of
the ladies of the church, for the Indian
famine sufferers, was even more success
ful than the first. Hundreds of people,
attracted by the pretty tea girls in their
charmirg Eastern costumes and the mu
sic and mirth that pervaded the whole
place, gathered around the tables and
enjoyed the tea that had been carried
nearly around the world and was served
from massive samovars by charming
maids and matrons.
The scene at night was partlcularly
charming, the costumes of the ladies un
der the bright lights giving a kaleido
scopic effect as they glided in and out
among the assembled guests. Mrs. Met-
ropofcky and Mrs. Krasoff presided at the
samjjpnrs. The costumes of the tea girls
weijtawis follows: Mrs. O. C. Schroder,
KoujfiLnian- Miss Mary Dabovieh, Ser
vi.ubflQSiss G. Ayov, Syrian; Misses Nata
lietflB^ Alexandria Metropolsky, Russian;
MinHPl. Krasoff. North Russian i>ea-sant;
liis^^LJzzie KashevnikolT and Miss Val
entine Ligda. Russian; Miss George and
MÂ£s Holtz, Roumanian.
The musical programme yesterday af
ternoon and last night was very enter
taining. George Leron and Mr. Warren
played the piano and violin, respectively;
the Misses Sophia and Lucy Czarnecke
rendered a charming vocal duet and Miss
Mary J'urin entertained at the piano in
the afternoon. Professor Moser's Zither
Club was an attraction in the evening.
Father Popoff made a hit by singing a
bass solo, and the Russian church choir
sang several national hymns and popular
Russian songs. Vocal solos were given
bv Miss Lottie Irving, Mrs. Irving and
Mrs. Whitney.
To-day will be the last day of the festi
val and' the ladies expect to have a big
crowd to take care of this afternoon.
There will be a special programme, full
of novelties for those who have not at
tended a Russian tea drinking. Every
body is invited to bo present.
RUSSIAN TEA FESTIVAL
ATTRACTING LARGE CROWD
Crusade Against Law-Breaking Deal
ers â Health Omcials Condemn
Government Supplies.
Health Inspectors Lahaney, Dunster,
Tracey, Robinson, Murphy, Slivers and
Williamson were stationed at three differ
ent points throughout the city eafly yes
terday morning and In a few hours four
hundred gallons of milk were taken from
passing: wagrons and poured down the
sewers at Eighteenth and Mission streets.
The milk was found to have been watered
not wisely but too well and consequent
ly It was condemned by the Inspectors as
unfit for human consumption. One of the
dealers whose milk was destroyed for not
coming up to standard quality was Joseph
Kennell, who threw up his. contract yes
terday for supplying milk to the City
and County Hospital. Dr. Sussdorf says
Kennell had not supplied any milk to the
hospital, so the patients have not suffered
from Impure milk. The operations of the
Health Officials were directed by Chief
Sanitary Inspector Chalmers and they
will be continued until the watering of
milk ceases.
Policeman Butterworth, detailed to the
Health Department, located a lot of Gov
ernment supplies which had been sold to
firms presumably for fertilizing purposes.
The stuff Included 94,475 pounds of beef in
barrels, 12,217 pounds of pork and 42,200
pounds of flour, and was stored in the
Government warehouse at 103 Market
street. The officials learned that a man
named Irkson had arranged to ship the
flour to Berkeley to have it manufac
tured into starch and it was detained
pending further investigation. According
to the health authorities the pork be
longed to Roth, Blum & Co. and the beef
to Captain A. Thompson. It will all be
coal oiled and sent to the fertilizing
works to-day.

"I am anxious to see the city's creditors
paid." said Mr. Brooks yesterday. "This
deficit has given mo a groat deal of worry.
because I have been misunderstood and
often misrepresented in the matter. I de-
Kire to eee that fund released, and will
certainly give precedence to a mandamus,

Hekbard would be taken to the Supreme
Court by the park promoters. I have no
Information that Fuch an appeal has been

WILLIAM HENRY WARE
IS SUED FOR DIVORCE
Two Aged Couples Have Trouble
Over Alimony â Ssveral New
Divorce Suits Filed.
William Henry Ware, a wealthy mer
chandise broker, was made the defendant
in an action for divorce yesterday by his
wife, Sarah K. Ware, who charges him
with infidelity. Mrs. AVare names Jo
sephine Smith, sometimes known as Nor
ton; as corespondent. Mrs. Ware claims
that her husband went on a camping trip
to Point Arena in July of 1S99 and at that
time met Miss Smith. She says she did
not secure proofs of her husband's asso
ciation with this woman until recently.
In addition to a decree of divorce Mrs.
Ware demands a division of the commu
nity property, which is worth a large sum
of money. .
Isaac Joseph, a tailor, appeared before
Judge Hebbard yesterday to show cause
why he should not be punished for con
tempt of court for having failed to obey
an order directing him to pay his wife,
Henrietta, $25 a month alimony pending
the conclusion of her action for divorce.
Joseph, who Is 64 years of age. married
his wife, who is a few years his junior, in
April of last year, live weeks after their
first meeting. Joseph said yesterday on
the stand that his silver haired bride had
taken all of his property, including his
diamond stud, since their marriage, and in
consequence he had no money with which
to obey the order of court.
Mrs. Joseph, made a vehement denial,
but the court avoided a controversy by
ordering a continuance until next Tues
day.
After thirty years of married Mfe, the
parents of eleven children, Jan. .3 Allen
and his wife. Elizabeth, appeared in Judge
liahrs" court yesterday to submit a dis
pute regarding unpaid alimony. Judge,
Bahrs concluded that the differences be
tween husband and wife were trivial and
he set about to effect a reconciliation. He
suggested to Mrs. Allen that she make up
her differences with her husband, and she
finally said: "All right. If he will make
up I'll shake." Allen was backward about
accepting his wife's offer for some time,
but finally when his attorney, Ben Hea
ley, said that if he would accept his wife's
offer he would remit his fee Allen capitu
lated and arm in arm with his wife left
the courtroom.
Suits for divorce have been filed by Al
vin Barrora apainst Lena Barrera for de
sertion. Ira De -Witt Clinton against
Grace Beebe Clinton for desertion. Abra
ham Lewkowitz against Cecelia Lewko
witz for cruelty. Rose T. Malgan against

her husband, William S. Lewis, for main

When the young wife discovered the
truth she left her husband, and with the
aid of the French Consul at Honolulu she
managed to escape and came to this city.
PRINCIPALS IN THE SHATTERED ROMANCE OF AN ITALIAN
PRINCESS' DAUGHTER AND A HAWAIIAN ADVENTURER.
' self the role of a modern Claude Melnotte.
He represented himseii as the son of King
r>avld Kalakaua I. declared he was the
legitimate heir to the Hawaiian throne
and dwelt with . noble eloquence on his
castles In the tropical islands, where one
day he hoped the poetess would rule with
him.
In due course of time, in the spring of
'S7, Wilcox and Miss Sobrero were married
and the "heir presumptive" to the Ha
waiian throne carried his bride with him
to his island home.
Once in the land where she hoped one
day to reign Mrs. Wilcox found herself
virtually a, prisoner: deprived of the so
ciety of her equals and excluded from
the presence of her inferiors. However,
she scon learned that the man she had
married was not of royal birth, but the
ROBERT WII.LJAM WILCOX, the
Hawaiian revolutionist, according
to a recent decree of the Supreme
Court in Turin, ItaJy. is no lonper
a benedict. That Wilcox Is the husband
of the Princess Kaohelelani, and the father
of her three children, did not seem to af
fect the Italian tribunal when it de
clared that the Hawaiian was a free and
eir.ple man and that his previous marriage
to Miss Gina Sobrcro was null and void.
This Is the first marriage to be annulled
In the courts of Italy since the famous
divorce of the great Garibaldi and Miss
Kaimondi early In the '7i"s. and It has
created no end of gossip In aristocratic
and military circles in which Mrs. Wil
cox la a shining llgbt
The wooir.g of the noble Italian maid
by the man from Honolulu and the subse
quent events which marked the early days
cf their union reads like a modernized
version of Claude Melnotte. All the facts
Â¦were brought out during the trial for di
vorce, much to the delight of the "high
life" of sunny Italy, which derives its
rarest pleasure by feeding its inflammable
Imagination on a diet of romance.
Kobert William Wilcox Lunama Kaaiu
eno as the Hawaiian revolutionist was
known in Italy, was *ent by the Hawaiian
Government to the land of the o^ive to
rtudv military tactics and with that end
in view was enrolled in the Royal Artil
lery School Of Turin. While attending
the artillery school Wilcox met the best
people, was receiv<xi in the most aristo
cratic houses in Italy, and was a welcome
guest at the home of one of his instruc
tors at the military institute, Baron
Scbrero. colonel in His Majesty's army.
Sobrero had a daughter, Gina. famed !
alike for her beauty and her v.-it. and in
the direction of the Italian belle Wilcox |
looked with greedy eyes. Miss Gina's j
position in Italian society was an exalted i
one. Her father wa< a Baron, her mother j
the Princess Oolonna de Stlgliano; while I
the young lady herself had more than
aristocratic birth to be proud of. She was
a recognized poete?s and novelist and had
g-ained fame under the nom de plume of
"Mawea."
It was whiie wooing the fair "Man
tra" that Wilccx began to create for him-

ITALIAN WIFE OF WILCOX, HAWAIIAN
REVOLUTIONIST, SECURES A DIVORCE
Declared He Was
King 'David's
Son and Heir
- Presumptive.
Exciting Career
of the Man
Who Married a
Turin Novelist.
Mrs. Gina Wilcox is now in Rome, where
she is living with her mother, the Princess
Colonna de Stlgliano.
In spite of the Italian divorce and his
Hawaiian mate it would appear that Wil
cox still loves the wife he woed and won
under false pretenses. Two weeks ago the
Hawaiian revolutionist was in this city
and he called on his ex-wife's brother,
Â¦who lives with his family on Green street,
just above Stockton. The object of Wll
cox's visit was to beg a picture of his
Italian wife so that he might carry It back
with him to his island home.
During the Spanish-American war Wil
cox offered his services to President Mc-
Klnley, but no attention was paid to his
offer.
When peace was again restored in the
islands Wilcox returned to the land of his
birth and is now serving his adopted coun
try as a public oftic'al.
Since the day the poetess GIna deserted
him Wilcox has led a turbulent existence
and followed a picturesque career. He
was the head of the rebel party In the late
Hawaiian Insurrection. He/ was taken
prisoner, convicted of high treason and
sentenced to death. President Dole after
ward commuted the death penalty to a
fine of $10,000 and thirty-five years impris
onment. Wilcox made his escape and
sought refuge in this city.
During her stay here the petted daugh
ter of a Baron and a Princess managed
to gain a precarious existence by con
tributing to the local Italian papers. Her
countrymen,- however, soon came to her
assistance and made up a purse for her
so she might return to Italy.
On the 4th of April, 1S95. Mrs. Wilcox
landed in Turin and immediately brought
suit for the annulment of her marriage,
alleging that Wilcox had married her un
der false pretenses. After a contest of
nearly two years' duration the case was
decided against Mrs. Wilcox, the court de
claring the plaintiff had not produced suf
ficient evidence to make good her com
plaint.
Mrs. Wilcox then appealed her case to
the Supreme Court, and two days ago that
tribunal granted tne decree of annulment.
While the case was pending Wilcox once
again went through the marriage cere
mony, this time not posing as a Prince,
but taking a Princess for wife â Princess
Kaohelelani, a direct descendant of the
Kamehamehas.
